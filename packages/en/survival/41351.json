There are several excellent text-books\r\nfor more advanced study, but there is no laboratory manual for use in the\r\nelementary portions of the science. In many secondary schools some\r\ninstruction in meteorology is given, and the keeping of meteorological\r\nrecords by the scholars is every year becoming more general. There is yet,\r\nhowever, but little system in this work, and, in consequence, there is\r\nlittle definite result. The object of this book is to supply a guide in\r\nthe elementary observational and inductive studies in meteorology. This\r\nManual is not intended to replace the text-books, but is designed to\r\nprepare the way for their more intelligent use. Simple preliminary\r\nexercises in the taking of meteorological observations, and in the study\r\nof the daily weather maps, as herein suggested, will lay a good foundation\r\non which later studies, in connection with the text-books, may be built\r\nup. Explanations of the various facts discovered through these exercises\r\nare not considered to lie within the scope of this book. They may be found\r\nin any of the newer text-books.\r\n\r\nThis Manual lays little claim to originality. Its essential features are\r\nbased on the recommendations in the Report on Geography of the Committee\r\nof Ten. A scheme of laboratory exercises, substantially the same as that\r\nproposed in this Report, was, for some fifteen years, the basis of the\r\nwork in elementary meteorology done in Harvard College under the direction\r\nof Professor William M. Davis. The plan proposed by the Committee of Ten\r\nhas been thoroughly tested by the writer during the past five years, not\r\nonly in college classes, but also in University Extension work among\r\nschool teachers, and the present book embodies such modifications of that\r\nscheme and additions to it as have been suggested by experience. Emphasis\r\nis laid throughout this Manual on the larger lessons to be learned from\r\nthe individual exercises, and on the relations of various atmospheric\r\nphenomena to human life and activities. No attempt is made to specify in\r\nexactly what school years this work should be undertaken. At present, and\r\nuntil meteorology attains a recognized position as a school study,\r\nteachers must obviously be left to decide this matter according to the\r\nopportunities offered in each school. The general outline of the work,\r\nhowever, as herein set forth, is intended to cover the grammar and the\r\nhigh school years, and may readily be adapted by the teacher to fit the\r\ncircumstances of any particular case.\r\n\r\nThis book contains specific instructions to the student as to the use of\r\nthe instruments; the carrying out of meteorological observations; the\r\ninvestigation of special simple problems by means of the instruments; and\r\nthe practical use of the daily weather maps. The Notes for the Teacher, at\r\nthe end of the book, are explanatory, and contain suggestions which may be\r\nuseful in directing the laboratory work of the class.\r\n\r\nIt has been the privilege of the author during the past ten years to study\r\nthe science of meteorology, and the methods of teaching that science,\r\nunder the constant direction of Professor William Morris Davis, of Harvard\r\nUniversity. To Professor Davis the author is further indebted for many\r\nvaluable suggestions in connection with the arrangement and treatment of\r\nthe subject-matter of this book. Thanks are due also to Mr. William H.\r\nSnyder, of Worcester (Mass.) Academy, and to Mr. John W. Smith, Local\r\nForecast Official of the United States Weather Bureau, Boston, Mass., for\r\nvalued criticisms.\r\n\r\n                                                 ROBERT DEC.

The changes from hot\r\nto cold, wet to dry, clear to cloudy, or the reverse, profoundly affect\r\nus. We make and unmake our daily plans; we study or we enjoy vacations; we\r\nvary our amusements and our clothing according to these changes. The\r\nweather forecasts for the day in the newspaper are read even before the\r\ntelegraphic despatches of important events. Sailors about to put to sea\r\ngovern themselves according to the storm warnings of our Weather Bureau.\r\nFarmers and shippers of fruit, meat, and vegetables anxiously watch the\r\nbulletins of cold or warm waves, and guard against damage by frost or\r\nexcessive heat. Steam and electric railways prepare their snow-plows when\r\na severe snowstorm is predicted.\r\n\r\nMeteorology, the science of the atmosphere, is thus of very great interest\r\nand importance. There is no subject a knowledge of which does more to make\r\nour daily life interesting. Since we live in the midst of the atmosphere\r\nand cannot escape from the changes that take place in it, we must,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, become observers of these changes. Examples\r\nof the varying processes at work in the atmosphere are always with us.\r\nThere is no end to the number and the variety of our illustrations of\r\nthese processes. Man is so profoundly affected by weather changes from day\r\nto day that all civilized countries have established weather services.\r\nObservers taking regular weather records are stationed at thousands of\r\ndifferent places in all parts of the world, and the observations which\r\nthey make are used by meteorologists in preparing daily weather maps and\r\nforecasts, and in studying the conditions of temperature, winds, and\r\nrainfall. In the United States alone there are about 3000 of these\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nThese observations are not made on land only. Hundreds of ship captains on\r\nall the oceans of the world are making their regular daily meteorological\r\nrecords, which at the end of the voyage are sent to some central\r\noffice,[1] where they are studied and employed in the preparation of Pilot\r\nCharts for the use of mariners. By means of these ocean meteorological\r\nobservations, which were first systematized and carried out on a large\r\nscale under the direction of Lieutenant Matthew Fontaine Maury (born,\r\n1806; died, 1873), of the United States Navy, it has become possible to\r\nlay out the most favorable sailing routes for vessels engaged in commerce\r\nin all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the United States, marine meteorological observations are\r\nforwarded to the United States Hydrographic Office, Navy Department,\r\nWashington.]\r\n\r\nSo important is a knowledge of the conditions of the winds and the\r\nweather, that scientific expeditions into unexplored or little-known\r\nregions give much of their time to meteorological observations. On the\r\nfamous Lady Franklin Bay Expedition (1881-1884) of Lieutenant (now\r\nGeneral) A. W. Greely, of the United States Army, meteorological\r\nobservations were kept up by the few feeble survivors, after death by\r\ndisease and starvation had almost wiped out the party altogether, and when\r\nthose who were left had but a few hours to live unless rescue came at\r\nonce. On Nansen’s expedition to the “Farthest North,” on Peary’s trips to\r\nGreenland, and on every recent voyage to the Arctic or the Antarctic,\r\nmeteorological instruments have formed an important part of the equipment.\r\n\r\nNot content with obtaining records from the air near the earth’s surface,\r\nmeteorologists have sent up their instruments by means of small, un-manned\r\nballoons to heights of 10 miles; and the use of kites for carrying up such\r\ninstruments has been so successful that, at Blue Hill Observatory, near\r\nBoston, Mass., records have been obtained from a height of over 2 miles.\r\nObservatories have also been established on mountain summits, where\r\nmeteorological observations have been made with more or less regularity.\r\nSuch observatories are those on Pike’s Peak, Colorado (14,134 feet), Mont\r\nBlanc, Switzerland (15,780 feet), and on El Misti, in southern Peru. The\r\nlatter, 19,200 feet above sea level, is the highest meteorological station\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe study of the meteorological conditions prevailing over the earth has\r\nthus become of world-wide importance. In the following exercises we shall\r\ncarry out, in a small way, investigations similar to those which have\r\noccupied and are now occupying the attention of meteorologists all over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN ELEMENTARY\r\n                              METEOROLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                PART I.——NON-INSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n            OBSERVATIONS OF TEMPERATURE; WIND DIRECTION AND\r\n                 VELOCITY; STATE OF SKY, AND RAINFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore beginning observations with the ordinary instruments, accustom\r\nyourself to making and recording observations of a general character, such\r\nas may be carried out without the use of any instruments whatever. Such\r\nrecords include: _Temperature_; _Wind Direction and Velocity_; _State of\r\nthe Sky_, _and Rainfall_.\r\n\r\n=Temperature.=——In keeping a record[2] of temperature without the use of a\r\nthermometer, excellent practice is given in observations of the\r\ntemperature actually felt by the human body. Our bodies are not\r\nthermometers. They do not indicate, by our sensations of heat or cold,\r\njust what is the temperature of the surrounding air, but they try to\r\nadjust themselves to the conditions in which they are. This adjustment\r\ndepends on many things beside the temperature of the air; _e.g._, the\r\nmoisture or humidity of the air; the movement of the air; the temperature\r\nand the nearness of surrounding objects. In summer, a day on which the\r\ntemperature reaches 80° or 85° often seems much hotter than another day on\r\nwhich the temperature rises to 95°. In winter, temperatures registered by\r\nthe thermometer as 10° or 15° above zero often feel a great deal colder\r\nthan temperatures of -5° or -10°. In recording your observations on\r\ntemperature, the record book may be divided into columns as follows:——\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Each scholar will need a blank book in which to preserve the\r\nobservations.]\r\n\r\n                     SAMPLE RECORD OF TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n  +---------+---------+--------------+------------------------------------+\r\n  |  DATE.  |  HOUR.  | TEMPERATURE. |         REMARKS.                   |\r\n  +---------+---------+--------------+----------------------------------- +\r\n  |Jan. 16  |  9 A.M. |   Chilly     |                                    |\r\n  | “    “  | 12 M.   |   Warmer     |                                    |\r\n  | “    “  |  4 P.M. |     “        | Growing slowly warmer all day.     |\r\n  | “   17  |  8 A.M. |    Warm      | About the same as Jan. 16, 4 P.M.  |\r\n  | “    “  | 11 A.M. |   Cooler     | Began to grow cooler about 10 A.M. |\r\n  | “    “  |  3 P.M. |   Colder     | Steadily becoming colder.          |\r\n  +---------+---------+--------------+------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the questions you should ask yourself in\r\ncarrying out this work. It is not expected that you will be able to answer\r\nall these questions at once, but that you will keep them in mind during\r\nyour studies, and try to discover the answers, as a result of your own\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nHow does it feel to you out of doors to-day? Is it hot, warm, cool, or\r\ncold? What is the difference between your feelings yesterday and to-day?\r\nBetween day before yesterday and to-day? Have you noticed any _regular_\r\nchange in your feelings as to warmth and cold during three or four\r\nsuccessive days? During the past week or two? During the past month? Is\r\nthere any difference between the temperature of morning, noon, afternoon,\r\nand evening? Is there any _regular_ variation in temperature during the\r\nday? Have there been any _sudden_ changes in temperature during the last\r\nfew days? Have these sudden changes brought warmer or cooler weather? Has\r\nthe warmer or cooler weather continued for a day or so, or has another\r\nchange quickly followed the first? Have the sudden changes, if you have\r\nnoted any, come at any regular times (as morning, afternoon, evening) or\r\nat irregular intervals? Does there seem to you to be any definite system,\r\nof any kind, in our changes of temperature? In what ways are people in\r\ngeneral affected by hot weather? By cold weather? What difference does a\r\nvery hot or a very cold day make in your own case?\r\n\r\n=Wind Direction and Velocity.=——Wind is an important meteorological\r\nelement because it has many close relations to human life. It affects very\r\nmarkedly our bodily sensations of heat or cold. A cold, calm day is\r\npleasanter than a cold, windy day. On the other hand, a hot, calm day is\r\nusually much more uncomfortable than a hot, windy day. High winds cause\r\nwrecks along seacoasts and damage houses, crops, and fruit trees. Sea\r\nbreezes bring in fresh, cool, pure air from the ocean on hot summer days.\r\nIn the tropics the sea breeze is so important in preserving the health of\r\nEuropeans in many places that it is known as “the doctor.” The movement of\r\nwind through large cities carries off the foul air which has collected in\r\nthe narrow streets and alleys, and is thus a great purifying agent.\r\n\r\nRecord the _direction of the wind_ according to the four cardinal points\r\nof the compass (N., E., S., and W.) and the four intermediate points (NE.,\r\nSE., SW., and NW.). The direction of the wind is the point _from_ which\r\nthe wind blows. You can determine the points of the compass roughly by\r\nnoting where the sun rises and where it sets.\r\n\r\nNote the _velocity of the wind_ according to the following scale, proposed\r\nby Professor H.

What is its velocity? Has its\r\ndirection or velocity changed since yesterday? If so, was the change\r\nsudden or gradual? Have you noticed any calms? What was the direction of\r\nthe wind before the calm? What after the calm? Does there seem to be more\r\nwind from one compass point than from another? Is there any relation\r\nbetween the direction of the wind and its velocity? _i.e._, is the NW.\r\nwind, for instance, usually a brisk or a high wind, or, is the SE. or S.\r\nwind usually moderate? Does the wind usually change its direction\r\ngradually, as from SE. to S., then to SW., then to W., etc., or does it\r\njump all at once, as from SE. to W.? Is there any relation between the\r\nvelocity of the wind and the hour of the day, _i.e._, does the wind seem\r\nstronger or weaker at noon than in the morning or at night? Is it a common\r\noccurrence to have a wind from the same direction for several successive\r\ndays, or are we apt to have different winds almost every day? Do you\r\nnotice any _systematic_ changes in wind direction which are often\r\nrepeated? What are these changes? Can you make a simple rule for them? In\r\nwhat ways does the wind affect us?\r\n\r\n=State of the Sky.=——By the _state of the sky_ is meant the condition of\r\nthe sky as to its cloudiness. Clouds add much to the beauty and variety of\r\nnature. They are often gorgeously colored at sunset. By their changes in\r\nform, color, and amount from day to day they relieve what might otherwise\r\nbe a wearisome succession of the same weather types. Prevailingly overcast\r\nskies have a depressing effect. Prevailingly clear skies become\r\nmonotonous. A proper amount of bright sunshine is essential for the\r\nripening of crops, but too much sunshine may parch soil and vegetation,\r\nand become injurious. Clouds bring rain; hence a sufficient amount of\r\ncloudiness is just as necessary as a sufficient amount of sunshine. The\r\ndrift of clouds shows us the direction of movement of the air above us,\r\nand is of considerable help in forecasting the weather. Fog, which is a\r\nvery low cloud, is in some cases so common as to be a meteorological\r\nelement of great importance. In the city of London, where fogs are very\r\nprevalent, especially in winter, the average number of hours of bright\r\nsunshine in December and January is only fifteen in each month. The London\r\nfogs are, in great part, due to the presence in the air of vast numbers of\r\nparticles of soot and smoke from millions of fires. These particles\r\nincrease the density of the fog and prolong its duration.\r\n\r\nThe amount of cloudiness is recorded on a scale of _tenths_. A _clear_ sky\r\nis one that is less than 3/10 cloudy; a _fair_ sky is from 3/10 to 7/10\r\ncloudy; and a _cloudy_ sky is over 7/10 cloudy. In observing the state of\r\nthe sky, note such points as the times of clouding and of clearing; the\r\narrangement of the clouds, _i.e._, whether they are few and scattered, or\r\ncover the sky with a uniform layer; the common forms of clouds; the\r\nchanges in the amounts of cloudiness, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother new column must be added in the record book for the cloudiness.\r\nThe table will now appear thus:——\r\n\r\n       SAMPLE RECORD OF TEMPERATURE, WIND, AND STATE OF THE SKY.\r\n\r\n  +-------+----------+--------------+----------------------+---------+----------------------+\r\n  |       |          |              |         WIND.        |  STATE  |                      |\r\n  | DATE. |  HOUR.   | TEMPERATURE. +-----------+----------+ OF SKY. |      REMARKS.        |\r\n  |       |          |              | DIRECTION.| VELOCITY.|         |                      |\r\n  +-------+----------+--------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------------------+\r\n  |Dec. 18| 9 A.M.   | Very cold    |    NW.    | Brisk    |  Clear  |Very cold all night.  |\r\n  |       |          |              |           |          |         |Everything frozen     |\r\n  |       |          |              |           |          |         |up.                   |\r\n  |       |          |              |           |          |         |                      |\r\n  | “   “ | 5 P.M.   |  “     “     |     “     |    “     |    “    |Same conditions.      |\r\n  |       |          |              |           |          |         |                      |\r\n  | “   19| 8.30 A.M.| A little     |     “     | Moderate |   Fair  |Wind less violent.    |\r\n  |       |          |   warmer     |           |          |         |Small clouds scattered|\r\n  |       |          |              |           |          |         |over the sky.         |\r\n  +-------+----------+--------------+-----------+----------+---------+----------------------+\r\n\r\nIs the sky _clear_, _fair_, or _cloudy_ to-day? Is there more or less\r\ncloud than there was yesterday? Than the day before yesterday? Is to-day a\r\nday of increasing or of decreasing cloudiness? Is the sky usually\r\nperfectly clear, or is it oftenest somewhat clouded over? How long does it\r\ntake for the sky to become completely covered with clouds from the time\r\nwhen it first begins to become cloudy? When there are a few clouds in the\r\nsky, are these usually scattered all over the sky, or are they in groups?\r\nHave you noticed any particular form of clouds which seemed familiar to\r\nyou? Do clouds seem to have certain definite shapes and appearances which\r\nare to be seen often? Do you discover any variation of cloudiness during\r\nthe day, _i.e._, is it apt to be more cloudy in the afternoon than in the\r\nmorning or at night? Can you make a list describing some of the clouds\r\nthat you see most often? Can you give these common kinds of clouds some\r\nnames of your own that shall describe them briefly? In what ways does a\r\nclear sky, with bright sunshine, affect us?\r\n\r\n=Rainfall.=——Under the general term _rainfall_, meteorologists include,\r\nbesides _rain_ itself, _snow_, _hail_, _sleet_, etc. The term\r\n_precipitation_ is also often used. Rainfall stands in close relation to\r\nhuman life and occupations. It feeds lakes and rivers, thus furnishing\r\nmeans of transportation, power for running mills and factories, and water\r\nsupplies for cities. Regions of abundant rainfall are usually heavily\r\nforested, like the Amazon valley in South America, and parts of Equatorial\r\nAfrica. In civilized countries lumbering is apt to be an important\r\noccupation in districts of heavy rainfall, as in Oregon and Washington in\r\nour own country, and in Southern Chile in South America. Where there is a\r\nmoderate rainfall, and other conditions are favorable, there agriculture\r\nis possible, and farming becomes one of the chief occupations, as in the\r\nMississippi and Missouri valleys in the United States, and in Western\r\nCanada. Districts which have a rainfall too small for successful\r\nagriculture, but are not by any means deserts, are often excellent grazing\r\nlands, as in the case of parts of Texas, Nebraska, and Kansas in the\r\nUnited States, and the Argentine Republic in South America. Where there is\r\nvery little rainfall deserts are found. Cities are not built in deserts,\r\nbecause there are no occupations to attract large numbers of men. The\r\ninhabitants of the desert are wandering tribes, which move from place to\r\nplace in search of water and food for themselves and their animals. Rain\r\nand snow cleanse the air, washing out impurities such as dust and smoke.\r\nHence they are important agents in preserving health.\r\n\r\nNote the _kind_ of precipitation (rain, snow, hail, sleet); the _amount_\r\n(heavy, moderate, light, trace); and the _time of the beginning and\r\nending_ of the storm or shower.\r\n\r\nThe record book must now be further subdivided into columns, to make room\r\nfor the rainfall observations, in this manner:——\r\n\r\n  SAMPLE RECORD OF TEMPERATURE, WIND, STATE OF SKY, AND PRECIPITATION.\r\n\r\n  +-------+---------+------------+--------------------+--------+-------------------+------------------+\r\n  |       |         |            |        WIND.       |        |   PRECIPITATION.  |                  |\r\n  |       |         |            +----------+---------+ STATE  +-------+-----+-----+                  |\r\n  | DATE. |  HOUR.  |TEMPERATURE.|          |         |   OF   | TIME  |     |     |     REMARKS.     |\r\n  |       |         |            |DIRECTION.|VELOCITY.|  SKY.  |  OF   |KIND.|AM’T.|                  |\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |BEGINN.|     |     |                  |\r\n  +-------+---------+------------+----------+---------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------------------+\r\n  |Mar. 21|8.30 A.M.|   Mild     |    S.    |  Light  |Overcast|8 A.M. |Rain |Light|  Raining.        |\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |       |     |     |                  |\r\n  | “   “ |  12 M.  |     “      |    “     |    “    |Overcast|       |  “  |  “  |     “            |\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |       |     |     |                  |\r\n  | “   “ |  4 P.M. |     “      |    “     |Moderate |Overcast|       |     |     |Stopped raining   |\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |       |     |     | about 3 P.M.     |\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |       |     |     |                  |\r\n  | “   22|  8 A.M. |   Cool     |   NW.    |  Brisk  | Clear  |       |     |     |Cleared off during|\r\n  |       |         |            |          |         |        |       |     |     | the night.       |\r\n  +-------+---------+------------+----------+---------+--------+-------+-----+-----+------------------+\r\n\r\nDoes most of our rain come in brief showers, or in storms lasting a day or\r\ntwo? Do we have about the same amount of rain or snow every week and every\r\nmonth, or does the amount vary a good deal from week to week and from\r\nmonth to month? Do you notice much difference in the characteristics of\r\nsuccessive storms, or do they all seem pretty much alike? Are\r\nthunderstorms limited to any particular season of the year? If so, to what\r\nseason? Have you discovered any rule as to the time of day when rainstorms\r\nor snowstorms begin? When thunderstorms begin and end? Is it common or\r\nuncommon for us to have a storm lasting three or four days? How long does\r\na thunderstorm usually last? Do we have most hail in winter or in summer?\r\nIn what ways does a rainy day affect people? How are you yourself\r\naffected? How does a heavy snowstorm affect travel and transportation? In\r\nwhat ways does a snowstorm differ from a rainstorm as to the character of\r\nthe precipitation and its effects?\r\n\r\nAfter studying the _temperature_, _wind_, _state of sky_, and _rainfall_\r\nseparately, take two elements together and see what relation one has to\r\nthe other. Try to answer such questions as these:——\r\n\r\n=Temperature and Wind.=——What relations can you discover between the\r\ndirection of the wind and the temperature? Which winds are the coolest?\r\nWhich the warmest? Does a hot, calm day seem warmer or cooler than a hot,\r\nwindy day? Does a cold, calm day seem colder or warmer than a cold, windy\r\nday? Does the _velocity_ of the wind have any effect on your feeling of\r\ncold or of warmth? If so, what effect?\r\n\r\n=Wind and State of Sky.=——Has the direction of the wind anything to do\r\nwith the cloudiness? Is there more apt to be considerable cloudiness with\r\nwind from one direction than from another? What winds are usually\r\naccompanied by the largest amount of cloud? What winds usually blow when\r\nthe sky is clear? Is the relation of cloudiness to certain wind directions\r\nso close that, if you know the wind direction, you can make a prediction\r\nas to the probable cloudiness? Are the winds with clouds more common in\r\none month than another? In one season than another? If so, which month?\r\nwhich season?\r\n\r\n=Temperature and State of Sky.=——Do you notice any relation between the\r\ntemperature and the state of the sky? In winter are our coldest days\r\nusually cloudy or clear? In summer are our hottest days cloudy or clear?\r\nAre the winds that give us the most cloudiness warm or cold winds in\r\nwinter and in summer? Is a cloudy night colder or warmer than a clear\r\nnight? Is a cloudy day colder or warmer than a clear day?\r\n\r\n=State of Sky and Precipitation.=——How is rainfall or snowfall related to\r\nthe cloudiness? Do we ever have rain or snow when the sky is not\r\ncompletely covered with clouds? Does the sky usually become quickly\r\ncovered with clouds before a rain? Does a sky wholly covered with clouds\r\nalways give us rain or snow? Does the sky clear rapidly or slowly after a\r\nrain? Are any particular kinds of clouds associated with rain or with\r\nsnowstorms? With brief showers? With thunderstorms?\r\n\r\n=Wind and Precipitation.=——Are any particular wind directions more likely\r\nthan others to give us rain or snow? Are these the same winds as those\r\nwhich give us the most cloudiness? What winds are they? Has the velocity\r\nof the wind any relation to the rain or snowstorm? Does the wind blow\r\nharder before, during, or after the rain or snow? What changes of wind\r\ndirection have you noted before, during, and after any storm? Have you\r\nnoticed these same changes in other storms? Are they so common in our\r\nstorms that you can make a rule as to these changes?\r\n\r\n=Temperature and Precipitation.=——Does a shower or a rainstorm in the\r\nhotter months affect the temperature of the air in any way? How? In the\r\nwinter does the temperature show any changes before a snowstorm? Is it\r\nusually warmer or colder then than a day or two before the storm and the\r\nday after? Is it usually uncomfortably cold during a snowstorm? Are rainy\r\nspells in the spring and the autumn months cooler or warmer than clear dry\r\nweather?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PART II.——INSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                 ELEMENTARY INSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe non-instrumental observations, suggested in the preceding chapter,\r\nprepare the way for the more exact records of the weather elements which\r\nare obtainable only by the use of instruments. The non-instrumental\r\nrecords are not to be entirely given up, even after the instrumental work\r\nand the weather-map exercises have begun, but should be continued\r\nthroughout the course. Notes on the forms and changes of clouds, on the\r\ntimes of beginning and ending, and on the character of the precipitation,\r\nas outlined in the last chapter, and other observations made without the\r\nuse of instruments, are an essential part of even the most advanced\r\nmeteorological records.\r\n\r\nThe simpler instruments are the _ordinary thermometer_, the _wind vane_,\r\nthe _rain gauge_, and the _mercurial barometer_ (in a modified form).\r\nObservations with these instruments, although of a simple character, can\r\nbe made very useful. The advance over the non-instrumental observations,\r\nwhich latter may be termed observations of _sensation_, is a decided one.\r\nIn place of the vague and untrustworthy statements concerning hot and\r\ncold, warm and cool days, we now have actual degrees of temperature to\r\nserve as a basis for comparison of day with day or month with month. The\r\nmeasurements of rain and snowfall enable us to study the amounts brought\r\nin different storms, the average precipitation of the various months, etc.\r\nThe important facts of change of pressure now become known, and also the\r\nrelation of these changes to the weather. Just as we have, in the earlier\r\nwork, become familiar with our typical weather changes and types, so we\r\nshall now have our eyes opened to the actual values of the temperatures\r\nand precipitation connected with these changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe =ordinary thermometer= (Greek: _heat measure_), the most commonly used\r\nand most widely known of all meteorological instruments, was in an\r\nelementary form known to Galileo, and was used by him in his lectures at\r\nthe University of Padua during the years 1592 to 1609. Thermometers enable\r\nus to measure the temperatures of different bodies by comparison with\r\ncertain universally accepted standards of temperature. These standards are\r\nthe freezing and boiling points of distilled water. In its common form the\r\nthermometer consists of a glass tube, closed at the top, and expanding at\r\nits lower end into a hollow spherical or cylindrical glass bulb. This bulb\r\nand part of the tube are filled with mercury or alcohol. As the\r\ntemperature rises, the liquid expands, flows out of the bulb, and rises in\r\nthe tube. As the temperature falls, the mercury or alcohol contracts, and\r\ntherefore stands at a lower level in the tube. In order that the amount of\r\nthis rise or fall may be accurately known, some definite scale for\r\nmeasurement must be adopted. The scale commonly used in this country owes\r\nits name to Fahrenheit (born in Danzig in 1686; died in 1736), who was the\r\nfirst to settle upon the use of mercury as the liquid in thermometers, and\r\nalso the first definitely to adopt two fixed points in graduating the\r\nscale. The division of this scale into 180° between the freezing point\r\n(32°) and the boiling point (212°) seems to have been taken from the\r\ngraduation of a semicircle. Fahrenheit was a manufacturer of all sorts of\r\nphysical apparatus, and it has been thought probable that he had some\r\nspecial facilities for dividing his thermometer tubes into 180 parts.\r\nMercury is most commonly used as the liquid in thermometers, because it\r\nreadily indicates changes of temperature, and because over most of the\r\nworld the winter cold is not sufficient to freeze it. The freezing point\r\nof mercury is about 40° below zero (-40° F.). Alcohol, which has a much\r\nlower freezing point, is therefore used in thermometers which are to be\r\nemployed in very cold regions. Alcohol thermometers must, for instance, be\r\nused in Northern Siberia, where the mean January temperature is 60° below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nThe temperature which meteorologists desire to obtain by the ordinary\r\nthermometer is the _temperature of the free air in the shade_. In order\r\nthat thermometers may indicate this temperature, they must, if possible,\r\nbe placed in an open space where there is an unobstructed circulation of\r\nthe air, and they must be protected from the direct rays of the sun. They\r\nare, therefore, usually _exposed_ inside of a cubical enclosure of wooden\r\nlattice work, in an open space away from buildings, and at a height of 4\r\nto 10 feet above the ground, preferably a grass-covered surface. This\r\nenclosure is called the _shelter_, and its object is to screen the\r\ninstrument from the direct and reflected sunshine, to allow free\r\ncirculation of air around the bulb, and to keep the thermometer dry.\r\nSometimes the shelter, instead of being in an open space on the ground, is\r\nbuilt on the roof or against the north wall of a building, or outside of\r\none of the windows. Fig. 2 shows an ordinary shelter.\r\n\r\nA still simpler method of exposure is described in the “Instructions for\r\nVoluntary Observers” (United States Weather Bureau, 1892) as follows:\r\n“Select a north window, preferably of an unoccupied room, especially in\r\nwinter. Fasten the blinds open at right angles to the wall of the house.\r\nFasten a narrow strip 3 inches wide across the window outside, and from 8\r\nto 12 inches from the window-pane. To this fasten the thermometers.” If\r\nnone of these methods of sheltering the instrument is feasible, the\r\nthermometer may be fastened to the window frame, about a foot from the\r\nwindow, and so arranged that it can be read from the inside of the room\r\nwithout opening the window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nReadings of the thermometer, to the nearest degree of temperature\r\nindicated on the scale by the top of the mercury column, are to be made at\r\nthe regular observation hours, and are to be entered in your record book.\r\nTemperatures below zero are preceded by a minus sign (-). A table similar\r\nto that suggested towards the close of the last chapter (p. 8) may be used\r\nin keeping these instrumental records, except that actual thermometer\r\nreadings can now be entered in the column headed “Temperature,” instead of\r\nusing only the general terms _warm_, _cold_, _chilly_, etc. This is a\r\ngreat gain. You will now be able to give fairly definite answers to many\r\nof the questions asked in Chapter I. Answer these questions with the help\r\nof your thermometer readings, as fully as you can.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Temperate Zone, in which we live, is peculiar in\r\nhaving frequent and rapid changes of temperature, not only from season to\r\nseason, but from day to day, and during a single day. In winter, we are\r\napt to have a warm wind immediately after a spell of crisp cold weather.\r\nIn summer, cloudy, cool days come as a sudden relief when we have been\r\nsuffering from intense heat, with brilliant sunshine.\r\n\r\nThese changes give a variety to our climate which is, on the whole, very\r\nbeneficial to man. The North Temperate Zone, with strong seasonal changes\r\nin temperature and weather, is the zone of the highest civilization and of\r\nthe greatest energy of man. In the Torrid Zone the changes of temperature\r\nare, as a whole, small. There is no harsh winter. The climate is\r\nmonotonous and deadening, rather than enlivening. Man finds it easy to\r\nlive without much work, and the inhabitants of the Torrid Zone have not,\r\nas a rule, advanced far in the scale of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe =wind vane= used by the Weather Bureau is about 6 feet long, and has a\r\ndivided tail made of pine boards, the two pieces making an angle of\r\n22-1/2°. The purpose of this divided tail is to steady the vane and to\r\nmake it more sensitive to light currents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nA common wind vane on a neighboring church steeple or flagstaff will\r\nusually serve sufficiently well for ordinary use. Observations of wind\r\ndirection (to eight compass points) are to be made as a part of the\r\nordinary weather record, and to be entered in the proper column of the\r\nrecord book.\r\n\r\nThe =rain gauge= consists of three separate parts, the receiver _A_, the\r\noverflow attachment _B_, and the measuring tube _C_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nThe inside diameter of the top of the receiver in the standard Weather\r\nBureau gauge is 8 inches (at _a_ in Fig. 4). This receiver has a\r\nfunnel-shaped bottom, so that all the precipitation which falls into it\r\nis carried at once into the measuring tube _C_, whose inside height is 20\r\ninches. The diameter of the measuring tube is 2.53 inches. The rain\r\nfalling into the receiver _A_ fills this tube _C_ to a depth greater than\r\nthe actual rainfall, in proportion as the area of the receiver is greater\r\nthan the area of the measuring tube. In the standard Weather Bureau gauges\r\nthe ratio of the area of the receiver to the area of the measuring tube is\r\nsuch that the depth of rainfall is magnified exactly ten times. The object\r\nof magnifying the amount in this way is to measure a very small quantity\r\nmore easily. The narrow portion of the receiver [_d_] fits over the top of\r\nthe measuring tube, holding the latter firmly in place and preventing any\r\nloss of rainfall. An opening, _e_, in the lower portion of the receiver\r\n[_d_], just on a level with the top of the measuring tube, serves as an\r\nescape for the water into the overflow attachment _B_, in case the\r\nrainfall is so heavy as to more than fill the tube. The inside diameter of\r\nthe overflow attachment is the same as that of the receiver (8 inches), as\r\nwill be seen from the figure.\r\n\r\nThe rain gauge should be firmly set in a wooden frame, so arranged that\r\nthe overflow attachment can readily be removed from the frame. The box in\r\nwhich the gauge is sent out by the manufacturer is usually designed to\r\nserve as a permanent support when the gauge is set up. The best exposure\r\nfor the gauge is an open space unobstructed by large trees, buildings, or\r\nfences. Fences, walls, or trees should be at a distance from the gauge not\r\nless than their own height. If an exposure upon the ground is out of the\r\nquestion, the gauge may be placed upon a roof, in which case the middle of\r\na flat unobstructed roof is the best position.\r\n\r\n=Records of Rainfall.=——Every rain gauge is provided with a measuring\r\nstick, which is graduated into inches and hundredths. It must be\r\nremembered that the amount of rain in the measuring tube is, by the\r\nconstruction of the ordinary gauge, ten times greater than the actual\r\nrainfall. This fact need not, however, be taken into account by the\r\nobserver, for the numbers used in graduating the measuring sticks have all\r\nbeen divided by 10, and therefore they represent the actual rainfall. The\r\ngraduations on the stick indicate hundredths of an inch, and should appear\r\nin the record as decimals (.10, .20, etc.). Ten inches of water in the\r\nmeasuring tube will reach the mark 1.00 on the stick; thus 1.00 denotes 1\r\ninch and zero hundredths of rain. One inch of water in the tube will reach\r\nthe .10 mark, indicating 10/100 of an inch. The shortest lines on the\r\nmeasuring stick denote successive hundredths of an inch. Thus, if water\r\ncollected comes to a point halfway between the .10 and .20 lines, the\r\namount is .15 inch, and so on. In measuring rainfall, the stick is lowered\r\nthrough the bottom of the receiver into the measuring tube, and on being\r\nwithdrawn the wet portion of the stick at once shows the depth of water in\r\nthe tube. Care must be exercised to put the end of the stick where the\r\nnumbering begins first into the gauge, and to pass the stick through the\r\nmiddle of the tube. After each observation the gauge should be emptied\r\nand drained, and immediately put back into place. When the total rainfall\r\nmore than fills the measuring tube, _i.e._, exceeds 2 inches, the receiver\r\nshould first be lifted off and the tube removed with great care so as not\r\nto spill any water. After emptying the tube, the surplus water in the\r\noverflow attachment must be poured into the measuring tube and measured.\r\nThe amount of rainfall thus found is to be added to the 2 inches contained\r\nin the measuring tube in order to give the total rainfall. If any water\r\nhappens to be spilled during its removal from the overflow attachment,\r\nthen the amount in the tube will be less than 2 inches, and it must be\r\ncarefully measured before the latter is emptied.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter season, in all regions where snow forms the chief part\r\nof the precipitation, the only portion of the rain gauge that need be\r\nexposed is the overflow attachment. The snow which falls into the gauge\r\nmay be measured by first melting the snow and then measuring the water as\r\nrainfall. About 10 inches of snow give, on the average, 1 inch of water,\r\nbut the ratio varies very greatly according to the density of the snow.\r\nBesides the measurement of the melted snow collected in the gauge, it is\r\ncustomary to keep a record of the depth of snowfall in inches, as measured\r\nby means of an ordinary foot rule or a yardstick, on some level place\r\nwhere there has been little or no drifting.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of rain and snowfall are usually made once a day, at 8 P.M.,\r\nand also at the end of every storm. Enter the amounts of precipitation in\r\nthe column of the table headed “Amount” and state always whether it is\r\n_rain_ or _melted snow_ that you have measured. When there has been no\r\nprecipitation since the last observation, an entry of 0.00 should be made\r\nin the column of the record book devoted to “Amount of Precipitation.”\r\nWhen the amount is too small to measure, the entry T (for _Trace_) should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nContinue your non-instrumental record of the time of beginning and ending\r\nof the precipitation as before. Whenever it is possible, keep a record of\r\nthe total amount of precipitation in each storm, noting this under\r\n“Remarks.” Try to answer such questions as are asked in Chapter I with the\r\nhelp of your instrumental record of the rain and snowfall. Note what\r\ndepths of snow in different snowstorms are necessary, when melted, to make\r\n1 inch of water.\r\n\r\n=The Mercurial Barometer.=——Air has weight. At sea level this weight\r\namounts to nearly 15 pounds on every square inch of surface. Imagine a\r\nlayer of water, 34 feet deep, covering the earth. The weight of this water\r\non every square inch of surface would be the same as the weight of the\r\nair. Under ordinary circumstances the weight of the air is not noticeable,\r\nbecause air presses equally in all directions, and the pressure within a\r\nbody is the same as that outside of it. On account of this equal pressure\r\nin all directions, we speak of the _pressure_ of the air instead of its\r\n_weight_. The effects of the air pressure may become apparent when we\r\nremove the air from a surface. By working the piston of a pump in a well\r\nwe may remove the pressure on the surface of the water in the tube of the\r\npump. When this is done, a column of water rises in the tube until the top\r\nof this column is about 34 feet above the level of the rest of the water\r\nin the well. The pressure of the atmosphere on the water _outside_ of the\r\ntube holds up this column of water _inside_ the tube.\r\n\r\nGalileo (1564-1642) first taught that the air has weight. His pupil\r\nTorricelli went a step further. Torricelli saw that the column of water,\r\nheld up by the pressure of the air in the tube of the pump, must exactly\r\nbalance a similar column of air, reaching from the surface of the water in\r\nthe well to the top of the atmosphere. The column of water, in other\r\nwords, exactly replaces this column of air. While working on this subject,\r\nTorricelli, in 1643, performed the following experiment. He filled a glass\r\ntube, about 3 feet long and closed at one end, with mercury. After\r\nfilling the tube, he put his finger over the open end and inverted the\r\ntube over a vessel containing mercury. When the lower end of the tube was\r\nbelow the surface of the mercury in the dish, he removed his finger. At\r\nonce the column of mercury fell in the tube until it stood at a height of\r\nabout 30 inches, leaving a vacant space of 6 inches in the upper part of\r\nthe tube. This space has since been known as the _Torricellian vacuum_.\r\nTorricelli had proved what he had expected, viz., that the height of the\r\ncolumn of liquid which replaces and balances an air column of the same\r\nsize varies with the weight of that liquid. It takes a column of water 34\r\nfeet long to balance a similar column of air. It takes a column of mercury\r\nonly 30 inches long to balance a similar column of air. This, as\r\nTorricelli correctly explained, is due to the fact that mercury is so much\r\n(13-1/2 times) heavier than water. The column of water weighs just the\r\nsame as the column of mercury. Each column exactly balances an air column\r\nof similar cross-section. The height of the water or of the mercury is a\r\nmeasure of the weight or pressure of the air. The greater the pressure on\r\nthe surface of the water in the well, the higher will be the top of the\r\nwater in the pump. The greater the pressure on the surface of the mercury\r\nin the basin, in the experiment of Torricelli, the higher will the mercury\r\ncolumn stand in the glass tube. Either water or mercury may be used as the\r\nliquid in the barometer. Otto von Guericke (1602-1686), of Magdeburg,\r\nconstructed a water barometer about 36 feet long, which he attached to the\r\noutside wall of his house. This barometer he used for some months, and\r\nmade predictions of coming weather changes by means of it. A water\r\nbarometer is, however, a very unwieldy thing to manage, on account of the\r\ngreat length of its tube. Furthermore, water barometers cannot be used in\r\nany countries where the temperatures fall to freezing. Mercury is the\r\nliquid universally employed in barometers. It is so heavy that only a\r\nsmall column of it is necessary to balance the atmospheric pressure.\r\nTherefore a mercurial barometer is portable. Further, mercury does not\r\nfreeze until the temperature falls to 40° below zero.\r\n\r\nAnother name which should be mentioned in connection with the barometer is\r\nthat of Blaise Pascal, who in 1648 fully confirmed Torricelli’s results.\r\nPascal saw that if the mercury column is really supported by the weight of\r\nthe air, the height of that column must be less on the summit of a\r\nmountain than at the base, because there is less air over the top of the\r\nmountain than at the bottom, and therefore the weight of the air must be\r\nless at the summit. To prove this, he asked his brother-in-law Perrier,\r\nwho lived at Clermont, in France, to carry the Torricellian tube up the\r\nPuy-de-Dôme, a mountain somewhat over 3500 feet high in Central France.\r\nThis Perrier did on Sept. 19, 1648, and he found, as predicted by Pascal,\r\nthat the mercury fell steadily in the tube as he went up the mountain, and\r\nthat at the top of the mountain the column of mercury was over 3 inches\r\nshorter than at the base.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the atmosphere is a weather element which, unlike the\r\nother elements already considered, cannot be observed without an\r\ninstrument. We cannot, under ordinary conditions at sea level, determine\r\nby any of our senses whether the pressure is rising or falling, or is\r\nstationary. The pressure on the upper floors of one of our high buildings\r\nis shown by a barometer to be considerably lower than it is at the level\r\nof the street below, and yet we notice no difference in our feelings at\r\nthe two levels.\r\n\r\nIt is only when we ascend far into the air, as in climbing a high mountain\r\nor in a balloon, that the much-diminished pressure at these great heights\r\nperceptibly influences the human body. Mountain climbers and aëronauts who\r\nreach altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet or more, usually suffer from\r\nheadache, nausea, and faintness, which have their cause in the reduced\r\npressure encountered at these heights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mercurial barometer in use to-day is, essentially, nothing\r\nmore than the glass tube and vessel of Torricelli’s famous experiment. A\r\nsimple form of the mercurial barometer is shown in Fig. 5. It consists of\r\na glass tube about one-quarter of an inch in inside diameter and about 36\r\ninches long. This tube, closed at the top and open at the bottom, is\r\nfilled with mercury, the lower, open end dipping into a cup of mercury\r\nknown as the _cistern_. The space above the mercury is a vacuum. The\r\nmercury extends inside the tube to a height corresponding to the weight or\r\npressure of the air, the vertical height of the top of the mercury column\r\nabove the level of the mercury in the cistern, in inches and hundredths of\r\nan inch, being the barometer reading. At sea level the normal barometer\r\nreading is about 30 inches. There is an opening near the top of the\r\ncistern, at the back of the instrument, through which the air gains access\r\nto the mercury and holds up the mercury column. It will readily be seen\r\nthat, as the mercury in the tube rises, the level of the mercury in the\r\ncistern falls, and _vice versa_, so that there is a varying relation\r\nbetween the two levels. In order to have the reading accurate, it is\r\nnecessary that the surface of the mercury in the cistern should be just at\r\nthe zero of the barometer scale when a reading is made. To accomplish\r\nthis, the bottom of the cistern consists of a buckskin bag which may be\r\nraised or lowered by means of a thumb-screw, seen at the lower end of the\r\ninstrument. The level of the mercury may thus be changed and adjusted to\r\nthe top of a black line, marked on the outside of the cistern, and which\r\nindicates the zero of the scale. Before making a reading, the surface of\r\nthe mercury in the cistern must be raised or lowered until it _just_\r\nreaches this black line. Then the top of the mercury column will give the\r\npressure of the air. The reading is made on an aluminum scale at the top\r\nof the wooden back on which the tube is mounted, this scale being\r\ngraduated both on the English and on the metric system. This barometer may\r\nbe hung against the wall of a room.\r\n\r\nThe =aneroid barometer= (Greek: _without fluid_), although less desirable\r\nin many ways than the mercurial, is nevertheless a useful instrument for\r\nrough observations. The aneroid is not good for careful scientific work,\r\nbecause its readings are apt to be rather inaccurate. To be of much value\r\nin indicating exact pressures, it should frequently be compared with and\r\nadjusted to a mercurial barometer. An ordinary aneroid barometer is shown\r\nin Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIn this instrument the changes in atmospheric pressure are measured by\r\ntheir effects in altering the shape of a small metallic box, known as the\r\n_vacuum chamber_. The upper and lower surfaces of this box are made of\r\nthin circular sheets of corrugated German silver, soldered together around\r\ntheir outer edges, thus forming a short cylinder. From this the air is\r\nexhausted, and it is then hermetically sealed. A strong steel spring,\r\ninside or outside of the vacuum chamber, holds apart the corrugated\r\nsurfaces, which tend to collapse, owing to the pressure of the external\r\nair upon them. An increase or decrease in the air pressure is accompanied\r\nby an approach, or a drawing apart, of the surfaces of the chamber. These\r\nslight movements are magnified by means of levers, a chain, and a spindle,\r\nand are made to turn an index hand or pointer on the face of the\r\ninstrument. The outer margin of the face, underneath the glass, is\r\ngraduated into inches and hundredths, and the pressure may thus be read at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nAs the tension of the steel spring varies with the temperature, aneroids\r\nare usually _compensated_ for temperature by having one of the levers made\r\nof two different metals, _e.g._, brass and iron, soldered together, or\r\nelse by leaving a small quantity of air in the vacuum chamber. This air,\r\nwhen heated, expands, and thus tends to compensate for the weaker action\r\nof the spring, due to the higher temperature. At best, however, this\r\ncompensation is but imperfect, and this fact, together with the friction\r\nof the different parts, the changes in the spring with age, and the need\r\nof frequent adjustments, makes aneroids rather inaccurate. They may be\r\nadjusted to mercurial barometers by means of a small screw, whose head may\r\nbe found on the lower surface of the instrument. The words _fair_,\r\n_stormy_, etc., which frequently appear on the face of aneroid barometers,\r\nare of little use in foretelling weather changes, as no definite pressures\r\nalways occur with the same weather conditions. The instrument should be\r\ntapped lightly a few times with the finger before a reading is made. The\r\nsecond pointer, which is often found in aneroids, is set by the observer\r\non the position marked by the index hand when he makes his reading. The\r\ndifference between the pressure marked by this set pointer and that shown\r\nby the index hand at the next observation is the measure of the change of\r\npressure in the interval.\r\n\r\nAnother column must now be added to the record book (preferably between\r\nthe columns devoted to _temperature_ and _wind_) to receive the “Pressure\r\nin Inches and Hundredths.”\r\n\r\nIs the pressure constant (_i.e._, are the readings always the same) or\r\ndoes it vary? If it varies, is there any apparent system in the\r\nvariations? Is there a tendency to a daily maximum? To a daily minimum? If\r\nso, about what time do these occur, respectively? What is the average\r\nvariation (in inches and hundredths) in the course of a day? What is the\r\ngreatest difference in pressure which you have observed in a day? What is\r\nthe least? Does the pressure seem to vary more or less in the colder\r\nmonths than in the warmer? Has the height of the mercury column any\r\nrelation to the weather? Are we likely to have rainy weather with rising\r\nbarometer? Is the velocity of the wind related to the pressure in any way?\r\nHow? Can you make any general rules for weather prediction based on the\r\naction of the barometer? What rules?\r\n\r\n=Tabulation of Observations.=——The tables suggested in the preceding\r\nchapter can be used unchanged with the simple instruments just described.\r\n\r\n=Summary of Observations.=——At the end of each month summarize your\r\ninstrumental observations in the following way:——\r\n\r\n_Temperature._——Add together all your temperature readings; divide their\r\nsum by the total number of observations of temperature, and the quotient\r\nwill give you a sufficiently accurate _mean_ or _average_ temperature for\r\nthe month in question. It is to be noted that the mean monthly\r\ntemperatures obtained from these observations will be much more accurate\r\nif the thermometer readings are made at 7 A.M. and 7 P.M., at 8 A.M. and 8\r\nP.M., etc., and the mean of these is taken; or if the mean is derived from\r\nthe maximum and the minimum temperatures, discussed in Chapter III. This\r\n_mean_ temperature should be written at the bottom of the temperature\r\ncolumn, and marked “Mean.” The mean monthly temperature is one of the\r\nimportant meteorological data in considering the climatic conditions of\r\nany place.\r\n\r\n_Wind._——Determine the frequency of the different wind directions by\r\ncounting the total number of times the wind has blown from N., NE., E.,\r\netc., during the month. The wind which you have observed the greatest\r\nnumber of times is the _prevailing_ wind. It may, of course, happen that\r\ntwo or three directions have been observed an equal number of times. The\r\nnumber of calms should also be recorded.\r\n\r\n_Rainfall._——The total monthly precipitation is obtained by adding\r\ntogether all the separate amounts of rainfall noted in your record book,\r\nand expressing the total, in inches and hundredths, at the bottom of the\r\nrainfall column. You now have the means for comparing one month’s rainfall\r\nwith that of another month, and of seeing how these amounts vary.\r\n\r\nExamine carefully also your _non-instrumental observations_. See whether\r\nyou can draw any general conclusions as to the greater prevalence of\r\ncloud, or of rain or snow, in one month than in another. Did the last\r\nmonth have more high winds than the one before? Or than the average? Were\r\nthe temperature changes more sudden and marked? Was there more or less\r\nprecipitation than in previous months?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                  ADVANCED INSTRUMENTAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instruments for more advanced study are the following: _maximum and\r\nminimum thermometers, wet and dry-bulb thermometers, sling psychrometer,\r\nstandard barometer, thermograph, barograph, and anemometer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n=Maximum and minimum thermometers= are usually mounted together on a\r\nboard, as shown in Fig. 7, the lower one of the two being the maximum, and\r\nthe upper the minimum. In the view of the instrument shelter (Fig. 2),\r\nthese thermometers are seen on the left. The minimum thermometer, when\r\nattached to its support, is either exactly horizontal or else slopes\r\ndownward somewhat towards the bulb end, as shown in Fig. 7. These\r\ninstruments, as their names imply, register the highest and the lowest\r\ntemperatures, respectively, which occur during each day of 24 hours. The\r\nmaximum thermometer is filled with mercury. Its tube is narrowed just\r\nabove the bulb, in such a way that the mercury passes through the\r\nconstriction with some difficulty. As the temperature rises, the mercury,\r\nin expanding, is forced out from the bulb through this narrow passage.\r\nWhen the temperature falls, however, the mercury above this point cannot\r\nget back into the bulb, there being nothing to force it back. The length\r\nof the mercury column, therefore, remains the same as it was when the\r\ntemperature was highest, and the instrument is read by observing the\r\nnumber of degrees indicated by the top, or right-hand end, of the mercury\r\ncolumn upon the scale. After reading, the thermometer is set by removing\r\nthe brass pin upon which the bulb end rests, and whirling the instrument\r\nrapidly around the pin to which its upper end is fastened. By this process\r\nthe mercury is driven back into the bulb, past the constriction. Care must\r\nbe taken to stop the thermometer safely while it is whirling. After\r\nsetting, the reading of the maximum thermometer should agree closely with\r\nthat of the ordinary or dry-bulb thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe _minimum thermometer_ is filled with alcohol, and contains within its\r\ntube a small black object, called the _index_, which resembles a\r\ndouble-headed black pin. The instrument is so constructed that this index,\r\nwhen placed with its upper, or right-hand end, at the surface of the\r\nalcohol, is left behind, within the alcohol, when the temperature rises.\r\nOn the other hand, when the temperature falls, the index is drawn towards\r\nthe bulb by the surface cohesion of the alcohol, the top or right end of\r\nthe index thus marking the lowest temperature reached. The upper end of\r\nthe thermometer is firmly fastened, by means of a screw, to a brass\r\nsupport, while the lower end rests upon a notched arm. In setting this\r\ninstrument, the bulb end is raised until the index slides along the tube\r\nto the end of the alcohol column. The thermometer is then carefully\r\nlowered back into the notch just referred to. Maximum and minimum\r\nthermometers need to be read only once a day, in the evening. The\r\ntemperatures then recorded are the highest and lowest reached during the\r\npreceding 24 hours. The observation hour is preferably 8 P.M., but if this\r\nis inconvenient, or impracticable, the reading may be made earlier in the\r\nafternoon. The hour, however, should be as late as possible, and should\r\nnot be varied from day to day. The maximum temperature sometimes occurs in\r\nthe night. The maximum and the minimum temperatures should be entered\r\nevery day, in a column headed “Maximum and Minimum Temperatures,” in your\r\nrecord book.\r\n\r\nThe =wet- and dry-bulb thermometers=, together commonly known as the\r\n_psychrometer_ (Greek: _cold measure_), are simply two ordinary mercurial\r\nthermometers, the bulb of one of which is wrapped in muslin, and kept\r\nmoist by means of a wick leading from the muslin cover to a small vessel\r\nof water attached to the frame (see Fig. 8). The wick carries water to the\r\nbulb just as a lamp wick carries oil to the flame. The psychrometer is\r\nseen inside the shelter on the right in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe air always has more or less moisture in it. Even the hot, dry air of\r\ndeserts contains some moisture. This moisture is either invisible or\r\nvisible. When invisible it is known as _water vapor_, and is a gas. When\r\nvisible, it appears as _clouds_ and _fog_, or in the liquid or solid form\r\nof _rain_, _snow_, and _hail_. The amount of moisture in the air, or the\r\n_humidity_ of the air, varies according to the temperature and other\r\nconditions. When the air contains as much water vapor as it can hold, it\r\nis said to be _saturated_. Its humidity is then high. When the air is not\r\nsaturated, evaporation goes on into it from moist surfaces and from\r\nplants. Water which changes to vapor is said to _evaporate_.\r\n\r\nThis process of evaporation needs energy to carry it on, and this energy\r\noften comes from the heat of some neighboring body. When you fan yourself\r\non a very hot day in summer, the evaporation of the moisture on your face\r\ntakes away some of the heat from the skin, and you feel cooler. The drier\r\nthe air on a hot day, the greater is the evaporation from all moist\r\nbodies, and hence the greater the amount of cooling of the surfaces of\r\nthose bodies. For this reason a hot day in summer, when the air is\r\ncomparatively dry, that is, not saturated with moisture, is cooler, other\r\nthings being equal, than a hot day when the air is very moist. Over\r\ndeserts the air is often so hot and dry that evaporation from the face and\r\nhands is very great, and the skin is burned and blistered. Over the\r\noceans, near the equator, the air is hot and excessively damp, so that\r\nthere is hardly any cooling of the body by evaporation, and the conditions\r\nare very uncomfortable. This region is known as the “Doldrums.”\r\n\r\nThe temperatures that are felt at the surface of the skin, especially\r\nwhere the skin is exposed, as on the face and hands, have been named\r\n_sensible temperatures_. Our sense of comfort in hot weather depends on\r\nthe _sensible_ temperatures. These sensible temperatures are not the same\r\nas the readings of the ordinary (dry-bulb) thermometer, because our\r\nsensation of heat or cold depends very largely on the amount of\r\nevaporation from the surface of the body, and the temperature of\r\nevaporation is obtained by means of the wet-bulb thermometer. Wet-bulb\r\nreadings at the various stations of the Weather Bureau are entered on\r\nall our daily weather maps. In summer (July) the sensible (wet-bulb)\r\ntemperatures are 20° below the ordinary air temperature in the dry\r\nsouthwestern portion of the United States (Nevada, Arizona, Utah). The\r\nmean July sensible temperatures there are from 50° to 65°; while on the\r\nAtlantic coast, from Boston to South Carolina, they are between 65° and\r\n75°. Hence over the latter district the temperatures actually experienced\r\nin July average higher than in the former.\r\n\r\nUnless the air is saturated with water vapor, the evaporation from the\r\nsurface of the wet-bulb thermometer will lower the temperature indicated\r\nby that instrument below that shown by the dry-bulb thermometer next to\r\nit, from which there is no evaporation. The drier the air, the greater the\r\nevaporation, and therefore the greater the difference between the readings\r\nof the two thermometers. By means of tables, constructed on the basis of\r\nlaboratory experiments, we may, knowing the readings of the wet and\r\ndry-bulb thermometers, easily determine the _dew-point_ and the _relative\r\nhumidity_ of the air——important factors in meteorological observations\r\n(see Chapter XXVI). In winter, when the temperature is below freezing, the\r\nmuslin of the wet-bulb thermometer should be moistened with water a little\r\nwhile before a reading is to be made. The amount of water vapor which air\r\ncan contain depends on the temperature of the air. The higher the\r\ntemperature, the greater is the capacity of the air for water vapor. Hence\r\nit follows that, if the temperature is lowered when air is saturated, the\r\ncapacity of the air is diminished. This means that the air can no longer\r\ncontain the same amount of moisture (invisible water vapor) as before.\r\nPart of this moisture is therefore changed, _condensed_, as it is said,\r\nfrom the condition of water vapor into that of cloud, fog, rain, or snow.\r\nThe temperature at which this change begins is called the _dew-point_ of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe _relative humidity_ of the air is the ratio between the amount of\r\nwater vapor which the air contains at any particular time and the total\r\namount which it could contain at the temperature it then has. Relative\r\nhumidity is expressed in percentages. Thus, air with a relative humidity\r\nof 50% has just half as much water vapor in it as it _could_ hold.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the readings of the wet-bulb thermometer are considerably\r\naffected by the amount of air movement past the bulb, and that in a light\r\nbreeze, or in a calm, the reading does not give accurate results as to the\r\nhumidity of the general body of air outside the shelter.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this difficulty another form of psychrometer has been devised.\r\n\r\nThe =sling psychrometer= (Fig. 9) consists simply of a pair of wet and\r\ndry-bulb thermometers, fastened together on a board or a strip of metal,\r\nto the upper part of which a cord with a loop at the end is attached. In\r\nthis form of psychrometer there is no vessel of water and no wick, but the\r\nmuslin cover of the wet-bulb thermometer must be thoroughly wet, by\r\nimmersion in water, just before each observation. The instrument is then\r\nwhirled around the hand at the rate of about 12 feet a second. After\r\nwhirling about 50 times, note the readings, and then whirl the instrument\r\nagain, and so on, until the wet bulb reaches its lowest reading. The\r\nlowest reading of the wet bulb, and the reading of the dry bulb at the\r\nsame time, are the two observations that should be recorded. Take care to\r\nhave the muslin wet throughout each observation, and in windy weather\r\nstand to leeward of the instrument, so that it may not be affected by the\r\nheat of your body. The true reading may be obtained within two or three\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nMake observations with the wet-bulb thermometer or the sling psychrometer\r\nas a part of your regular daily weather record. Note the temperatures\r\nindicated by the wet and dry bulbs, and, by means of the table in Chapter\r\nXXVI, obtain the _dew-point_ and the _relative humidity_ of the air at\r\neach observation. Enter these data in your record book, in a column headed\r\n“Humidity,” and subdivided into two columns, one for the dew-point and one\r\nfor the relative humidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nBy means of observations with the psychrometer you will be able to answer\r\nsuch questions as the following:——\r\n\r\nDoes the relative humidity vary from day to day? Has it any relation to\r\nthe direction of the wind? To the state of the sky? To precipitation? Does\r\nit show any _regular_ variations during the course of a day? How does a\r\nhigh degree of relative humidity affect you in cold weather? In hot\r\nweather? Between what limits of percentages does the relative humidity\r\nvary? Do the changes come gradually or suddenly? Are these changes related\r\nin any way to the changes in the other weather elements? How do the\r\nsensible temperatures vary? In what weather conditions do the sensible\r\ntemperatures differ most from the air temperatures? In what seasons?\r\nCompare the sensible temperatures obtained by your own observations with\r\nthe sensible temperatures at various stations of the Weather Bureau, as\r\ngiven on the daily weather map. Are there any fairly regular differences\r\nbetween the sensible temperatures observed at your own station and the\r\nWeather Bureau stations?\r\n\r\n=Standard Mercurial Barometer.=——A simple form of barometer has been\r\ndescribed in Chapter II. The ordinary standard mercurial barometer used by\r\nthe Weather Bureau (Fig. 10) has the glass tube containing the mercury\r\nsurrounded by a thin brass covering, through which openings are cut, near\r\nthe top, on the front and back, exposing to view the glass tube and the\r\ntop of the mercury column. On one side of this opening there is a strip of\r\nmetal, graduated to inches and tenths or twentieths, by means of which the\r\nheight of the barometer is determined. This strip, for barometers used at\r\nor near sea level, is about 4 inches long, the variations in pressure\r\nunder normal conditions not exceeding that amount. In addition to this\r\nfixed scale there is a small scale, also graduated, which may be moved up\r\nand down the opening in the enclosing brass case by means of a milled head\r\noutside and a small rack and pinion inside the brass case. This movable\r\nscale, known as the _vernier_ from the name of its inventor, Vernier, is\r\nan ingenious device, by means of which more accurate readings of the\r\nbarometer can be made than is possible with the ordinary fixed scale. A\r\n_vernier_ graduated into twenty-five parts enables the observer to make\r\nreadings accurately to the one-thousandth part of an inch. On the front of\r\nthe barometer there is a small thermometer, known as the _attached\r\nthermometer_. The bulb of this thermometer, concealed within the metal\r\ncasing of the barometer, is nearly in contact with the glass tube\r\ncontaining the mercury. The air, upon whose weight the height of the\r\nmercury column depends, gains access to the top of the cistern through\r\nleather joints, by which the cistern is joined to the glass tube.\r\n\r\nMercurial barometers of the Weather Bureau pattern are best hung in a\r\nbarometer box, fastened securely against the wall of a room, where there\r\nis a good light on the instrument and where the temperature is as constant\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nIn all accurate work certain corrections have to be applied to barometer\r\nreadings to make them strictly comparable. These are: (1) _correction for\r\naltitude_; (2) _correction for temperature_; and (3) _correction for\r\nlatitude_. The first is necessary because of the fact that the weight of\r\nthe air decreases upwards, and a barometer reading on a hill or a\r\nmountain is not comparable with one at sea level unless the former has\r\nbeen corrected by the addition of the weight of the column of air between\r\nthe hill or mountain and sea level. The correction for temperature is\r\nrendered necessary by the fact that with increasing temperature the\r\nmercury in the barometer tube expands more than the metallic scale,\r\nbecause mercury is more sensitive to heat, and unless some allowance is\r\nmade for this fact, barometer readings made at high temperatures will show\r\nsomewhat too high a pressure. The readings of the attached thermometer\r\ngive the temperature of the mercury and are used in making the corrections\r\nfor temperature. As gravity varies from a maximum value at the poles to a\r\nminimum value at the equator, barometer readings made at different\r\nlatitudes are _corrected for latitude_, which means that they are reduced\r\nto latitude 45°, midway between 0° and 90°. The correction is +0.08″ at\r\nthe poles and -0.08″ at the equator. Tables for use in correcting\r\nbarometer readings for altitude and for temperature are given in Chapter\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n=Thermograph and Barograph.=——Two instruments of much interest are the\r\nself-recording thermometer, or _thermograph_, and the self-recording\r\nbarometer, or _barograph_, manufactured by Richard Brothers of Paris. In\r\nthe thermograph (Fig. 11) there is a brass cylinder around which a sheet\r\nof paper is wound, this paper being divided into two-hour intervals of\r\ntime and into spaces representing differences of 5° or 10° of temperature.\r\nThe cylinder revolves once in a week, being driven by clock-work contained\r\nwithin it. The thermometer consists of a flat, bent, hollow brass tube\r\ncontaining alcohol, one end of the tube being fastened to the metallic\r\nframe seen at the right of the figure, and the other end being free to\r\nmove. With rising temperature, the liquid in the tube expanding more than\r\nthe metallic casing, by reason of its greater sensitiveness to heat, tends\r\nto straighten the tube, while with falling temperature the elasticity of\r\nthe tube turns it into a sharper curve. These movements of the free end of\r\nthe tube are carried through a train of levers and thus magnified. At the\r\nend of the last lever is a metallic pen filled with ink, which rests\r\nlightly against the paper on the revolving drum. A rise or fall in\r\ntemperature is thus recorded by a rise or fall of the pen on the record\r\nsheet, and a continuous curve of temperature is secured. The pen of the\r\nthermograph should be frequently adjusted to make the reading of the\r\ninstrument accord with that of a standard mercurial thermometer, and care\r\nshould be taken to have the clock keep good time. These adjustments can\r\nreadily be made by means of a screw and a regulator, respectively. The\r\nthermograph should be exposed in the instrument shelter with the other\r\nthermometers. The sheets should be changed, the clock wound, and the pen\r\nfilled once a week, preferably on Monday, at 8 A.M., or at noon.\r\n\r\nThe continuous records written by a thermograph are a valuable addition to\r\nthe fragmentary observations which are the result of eye readings of the\r\nordinary thermometer. From the former any omitted thermometer readings may\r\nbe supplied. The interest of thermograph records may be seen in the\r\nfollowing figure (Fig. 12), in which curves traced under different\r\nconditions are reproduced. Curve _a_ illustrates a period of clear\r\nwarming weather at Nashua, N. H., April 27-30, 1889. Curve _b_ was traced\r\nduring a spell of cloudy weather at Nashua, accompanying the passage of a\r\nWest India hurricane, Sept. 13-16, 1889. Curve _c_ illustrates the change\r\nfrom a time of moderate winter weather to a cold spell (Nashua, Feb.\r\n22-25, 1889). Curve _d_ exhibits a steady fall of temperature from the\r\nnight of one day over the next noon to the following night, during the\r\napproach of a winter cold spell (Nashua, Jan. 19-21, 1889). Curve _e_\r\nshows a reverse condition, viz., a continuous rise of temperature through\r\na night from noon to noon (Nashua, Dec. 16-17, 1888). Curve _f_ shows the\r\noccurrence of a high temperature at night, caused by warm southerly winds,\r\nfollowed by cold westerly winds (Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 30-Dec. 1, 1890).\r\nCurve _g_ illustrates the sudden rise of temperature due to the coming of\r\na hot, dry wind (chinook) at Fort Assiniboine, Mont. (Jan. 19, 1892). A\r\nstudy of such records leads to the discovery of many important facts,\r\nwhich would be completely lost sight of without a continuous record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe =barograph= (Fig. 13) is very similar to the thermograph in general\r\nappearance. The essential portion of this instrument consists of a series\r\nof six or eight hollow shells of corrugated metal screwed one over the\r\nother in a vertical column. These shells are exhausted of air, and form,\r\nin reality, an aneroid barometer which is six or eight times as sensitive\r\nas the ordinary single-chamber aneroid. The springs for distending the\r\nshells are inside. The base of the column being fixed, the upper end rises\r\nand falls with the variations in pressure. The movements of the shells are\r\nmagnified by being carried through a series of levers, and, as in the\r\nthermograph, the motion is finally given to a pen at the end of the long\r\nlever. The compensation for temperature is the same as in the ordinary\r\naneroid. A small quantity of air is left in one of the shells to\r\ncounteract, by its own expansion at increased temperature, the tendency of\r\nthe barometer to register too low on account of the weakening of the\r\nsprings. The barograph may be placed upon a shelf in the schoolroom, where\r\nit can remain free from disturbance, and yet where the record may be\r\nclearly seen. The general care of the barograph is the same as that of the\r\nthermograph. Brief instructions concerning the care and adjustments of\r\nthese instruments are sent out by the makers with each instrument.\r\nFrequent comparison with a mercurial barometer is necessary, the\r\nadjustment of the barograph being made by turning a screw, underneath the\r\ncolumn of shells, on the lower side of the wooden case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nBarograph records are fully as interesting as those made by the\r\nthermograph. The week’s record traced on the writer’s barograph during a\r\nwinter voyage from Punta Arenas, Strait of Magellan, to Corral, Chile,\r\nAug. 2-9, 1897, gives a striking picture of the rapid and marked changes\r\nof pressure during seven days in the South Pacific Ocean (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe following figure (Fig. 15) presents samples of barograph curves traced\r\nat Harvard College Observatory, Cambridge, Mass., during Feb. 22-28, 1887,\r\nand May 17-23, 1887. The February curve illustrates well the large and\r\nirregular fluctuations in pressure, characteristic of our winter months;\r\nwhile the May curve shows clearly the more even quality of the pressure\r\nchanges in our summer.\r\n\r\nThe =anemometer= shown in Fig. 16 is the most generally used of\r\ninstruments designed to measure wind velocity. It is known as the Robinson\r\ncup anemometer, and consists of four hollow hemispherical cups upon arms\r\ncrossed at right angles, and all facing the same way around the circle.\r\nThe cross-arms are fixed upon a vertical axis having an endless screw at\r\nits lower end. When the cups move around, the endless screw turns two\r\ndials which register the number of miles traveled by the wind. The Weather\r\nBureau pattern of anemometer has the dials mounted concentrically, the\r\nouter dial having 100, and the inner, 99 divisions. The revolutions of\r\nthe outer dial are recorded on the inner one, and in making an observation\r\nof the number of miles traveled by the wind, the hundreds and tens of\r\nmiles are taken from the inner dial, and the miles and tenths from the\r\nouter one. Take from the inner scale the hundreds and tens of miles\r\ncontained between the zero of that scale and the zero of the outer one.\r\nTake on the outer scale the miles and tenths of miles contained between\r\nthe zero of that scale and the index point of the instrument. The sum of\r\nthese readings is the reading of the instrument at the time of the\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nWind velocities are recorded in miles per hour. The velocity of the wind\r\nat any particular moment is found by noting the number of miles and tenths\r\nof miles recorded by the index before and after an interval of one minute,\r\nor of five minutes, and multiplying this rate by 60 or by 12 as the case\r\nmay be. This gives the number of miles an hour that the wind is blowing at\r\nthe time of observation.\r\n\r\nRecords of wind velocity (in miles per hour) are to be made at each\r\nregular observation hour, and are to be entered in the proper column of\r\nthe table in your record book. The total wind movement in each 24 hours is\r\nto be observed once a day, always at the same hour, and is to be entered\r\nin its proper column in the record book.\r\n\r\nThe total wind movement for 24 hours is obtained as follows: Subtract the\r\nreading of the anemometer at 12 noon (or 8 A.M., or any other hour) of the\r\npreceding day from the reading taken at 12 noon or the corresponding hour\r\nof the current day, and the difference will be the total movement of the\r\nwind. When the reading of the anemometer is less than the reading of the\r\npreceding day, 990 miles should be added to it; and the remainder, after\r\nsubtracting the reading of the preceding day, will be the total wind\r\nmovement for the 24 hours. Thus: To-day’s reading = 91 miles; yesterday’s\r\nreading = 950 miles. Hence 91 + 990 = 1081 miles, 1081 - 950 = 131 miles\r\n= total wind movement for the current day.\r\n\r\nBy means of an electrical attachment the anemometer may be arranged so as\r\nto record continuously on a cylinder rotating by clock-work, a pen making\r\na mark on the paper for every mile traveled by the wind. The anemometer\r\nshould be exposed on top of a building where there is as little\r\nobstruction as possible by tall chimneys, higher buildings, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe =nephoscope= (Greek: _cloud observer_) is an instrument used in\r\ndetermining the directions of movement of clouds. These directions, if\r\ndetermined by ordinary eye observation of the clouds as they drift across\r\nthe sky, are apt to be quite inaccurate. The best method of observing\r\ndirections of cloud movement is to note the path of the reflection of the\r\ncloud in a horizontal mirror, the observer looking at this reflection\r\nthrough an eyepiece which remains fixed during the operation. Such a\r\nhorizontal mirror, adapted to measure the direction of motion of clouds,\r\nis known as a _nephoscope_. A form of nephoscope devised by Mr. H. H.\r\nClayton, of Blue Hill Observatory, Hyde Park, Mass., is shown in Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nThis instrument consists of a circular mirror, 13 inches in diameter,\r\nsunk in a narrow circular wooden frame, on top of which is fastened a\r\nbrass circle, S.W.N.E., divided to 5° of arc. Inside of this fixed circle\r\nis a movable brass one, to which is attached a brass arc, _BD_, rising\r\nabove the mirror and bearing a movable eyepiece, _C_. This arc forms the\r\nquadrant of a circle whose center is the center of the mirror, and is\r\ndivided to 5° of arc. Its top is held vertically over the center of the\r\nmirror by two rods fastened to the movable circle. The center of the\r\nmirror _A_ is marked by cross lines on the reflecting surface, the glass\r\nof which is thin. In order to determine the motion of a cloud, the movable\r\ncircle and tripod are revolved until the arc _BD_ is in the vertical plane\r\nformed by the cloud, the center of the mirror, and the eye. The eyepiece\r\n_C_ is then shifted until some point of the cloud image, as seen through\r\nthe eyepiece, is projected on the intersection of the cross lines on the\r\nglass. The cloud image soon changes its position, and while the eye is\r\nstill held at the eyepiece, a small index is placed on the part of the\r\ncloud image which previously appeared on the center of the mirror. If now\r\na ruler be placed on the index and the center of the mirror and extended\r\nbackward, its intersection with the divided scale will give the direction\r\nfrom which the cloud came to the nearest degree, if all the measurements\r\nhave been accurately made. The height of the cloud above the horizon is\r\nfound by reading the position of the eyepiece on the divided quadrant.\r\n\r\nThe nephoscope may be placed on a table, out of doors in fine weather, or\r\nclose to a window from which the clouds to be observed can be seen. The\r\ninstrument must be properly oriented, so that the four points marked N.,\r\nE., S., and W. on the frame shall correspond to the four chief compass\r\ndirections. The zero (0°) of the movable brass scale is usually put at the\r\nS. Hence, if a cloud is found moving from exactly SW., the angular\r\nmeasurement of its direction of motion will be 45°. If a cloud is moving\r\nfrom due E., the angular measurement of its direction of motion will be\r\n270°.\r\n\r\nWhen the sky is completely overcast with a uniform layer of cloud, it is\r\nusually impossible to determine any direction of movement, because of the\r\ndifficulty of selecting and keeping in view, on the mirror, some\r\nparticular point of cloud.\r\n\r\nObservations with the nephoscope may be made as often as is desired, and\r\nshould be entered in an appropriate column in the record book.\r\n\r\n=Tabulation of Observations.=——A convenient form of table which may be\r\nused in the complete instrumental observations is given on the next page.\r\nThe number of columns and their arrangement may, of course, be varied to\r\nsuit the number and the nature of the records.\r\n\r\n=Summary of Observations.=——In the preceding chapter we have seen how to\r\nobtain the mean monthly temperature from the daily observations, the\r\nfrequency of the different wind directions for each month, and the total\r\nmonthly precipitation. The addition of the new instruments, the maximum\r\nand minimum thermometers, the psychrometer, the anemometer, and the\r\nnephoscope, enables us to obtain the following additional data in our\r\nmonthly summaries.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._——The _mean monthly temperature_ may be obtained from the\r\nmaximum and minimum temperatures as follows: Add together all the daily\r\nmaximum and minimum temperatures for a month. Divide this sum by the total\r\nnumber of readings you have made of each thermometer (_i.e._, one reading\r\nof the maximum and one of the minimum each day, making two readings a\r\nday), and the result will be the _mean monthly temperature_ derived from\r\nthe maximum and minimum temperature. This is a more accurate mean\r\ntemperature than the one noted in the summary of the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nAdd together all the maximum temperatures noted during one month. Divide\r\nthis sum by the number of observations, and the result gives the _mean\r\nmaximum temperature_ for the month.\r\n\r\n                    TABLE FOR METEOROLOGICAL RECORD.\r\n\r\n  ||                                      | DATE.                          ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | HOUR.                          ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | PRESSURE (in                   ||\r\n  ||                                      |  inches).                      ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | DRY BULB.      |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | WET BULB.      | TEMPERATURE.  ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | MAX.           |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | MIN.           |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | DEW-POINT.     |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | RELATIVE       | HUMIDITY.     ||\r\n  ||                                      |  HUMIDITY.     |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | DIRECTION.     |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | VELOCITY       | WIND.         ||\r\n  ||                                      |  (miles per    |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |  hr.).         |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | TOTAL MILES    |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |   PER DAY.     |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | KIND.          |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | AMOUNT (in     |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |  tenths).      |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | DIRECTION OF   | CLOUDS.       ||\r\n  ||                                      |  MOVEMENT.     |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | ANGULAR        |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |  ALTITUDE      |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | TIME OF        |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |  BEGINNING     |               ||\r\n  ||                                      |  AND ENDING.   |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | KIND.          | PRECIPITATION.||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+               ||\r\n  ||                                      | AMOUNT.        |               ||\r\n  |+--------------------------------------+----------------+---------------+|\r\n  ||                                      | REMARKS.                       ||\r\n  ||                                      |                                ||\r\n  ||                                      |                                ||\r\n  ||                                      |                                ||\r\n  ||                                      |                                ||\r\n\r\nA similar operation applied to the minimum temperatures gives the _mean\r\nminimum temperature_ for the month.\r\n\r\nIn meteorological summaries it is customary also to include the _absolute\r\nmaximum_ and the _absolute minimum_ temperatures, _i.e._, the highest and\r\nlowest single readings of the thermometer made during each month. These\r\ncan easily be determined by simple inspection of your record book. Note\r\nalso the dates on which the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe _absolute monthly range_ of temperature is the difference, in degrees,\r\nbetween the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum.\r\n\r\n_Humidity._——The _mean relative_ humidity is obtained by adding together\r\nall the different percentages of relative humidity obtained during the\r\nmonth, and dividing this sum by the whole number of observations of this\r\nweather element.\r\n\r\n_Wind._——The _mean velocity_ of the wind corresponding to the different\r\nwind directions is readily obtained by adding together all the different\r\nvelocities (in miles per hour) observed in winds from the different\r\ndirections, and dividing these sums by the number of cases. The wind\r\nsummaries will thus give the frequency of the different directions during\r\neach month, and the corresponding mean velocities.\r\n\r\nThe _maximum hourly wind velocity_ is obtained by inspection of the\r\nvelocity column.\r\n\r\nThe _total monthly wind movement_ is readily deduced from the daily\r\nrecords in the twelfth column of the table on p. 44.\r\n\r\n_State of the Sky._——In connection with the more advanced records\r\ndescribed in this chapter, the observations of cloudiness should record\r\nthe number of _tenths_ of the sky cloudy, as closely as the amount can be\r\nestimated by eye, instead of indicating the state of the sky as _cloudy_,\r\n_fair_, etc. A detailed record of cloudiness in tenths gives opportunity\r\nto determine the _mean cloudiness_ for each month, by averaging, as in the\r\ncase of the other means already described.\r\n\r\nIf nephoscope observations are made, the monthly summary may include the\r\n_mean direction of cloud movement_ for each month. This is obtained by\r\nadding together all the different angular measurements of directions of\r\ncloud movement, and dividing by the whole number of such observations.\r\n\r\nBy means of your monthly summaries compare one month with another. Notice\r\nhow the means and the extremes of the different weather elements are\r\nrelated; how they vary from month to month. Are there any _progressive_\r\nchanges in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, etc., from month to\r\nmonth? What are the changes? Summarize, in a short written statement, the\r\nmeteorological characteristics of each month as shown by your tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       PART III.——EXERCISES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF WEATHER MAPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                         THE DAILY WEATHER MAP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first daily weather maps were issued in connection with the Great\r\nExhibition of 1851 in London. The data were collected by the Electric\r\nTelegraph Company and transmitted to London over its wires. These maps\r\nwere published and sold daily (excepting Sundays) from Aug. 8 to Oct. 11,\r\n1851. The first official weather map of the United States Weather Service\r\nwas prepared in manuscript on Nov. 1, 1870, and on Jan. 14, 1871, the work\r\nof manifolding the maps for distribution was begun at Washington. Previous\r\nto the publication of this government map, Professor Cleveland Abbe had\r\nissued in Cincinnati, with the support of the Chamber of Commerce of that\r\ncity, the first current weather maps published in the United States (Feb.\r\n24 to Dec. 10, 1870). In France, daily weather maps have been published\r\ncontinuously since Sept. 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nTwo things are essential for the publication of a daily synoptic weather\r\nmap; _first_, simultaneous meteorological observations over an extended\r\narea; and, _second_, the immediate collection of these observations by\r\ntelegraph. The weather map of the United States is based on simultaneous\r\nobservations made at about 150 stations in different parts of this\r\ncountry, besides several coöperating stations in Canada, Central America,\r\nMexico, and the West Indies. At each of our stations, whose location may\r\nbe seen on any weather map, the Weather Bureau employs one or more\r\nobservers, who, twice a day, at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M., “Eastern Standard\r\nTime,” make regular observations of the ordinary weather elements, _i.e._,\r\ntemperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction and velocity,\r\nprecipitation, cloudiness, etc. The instruments at these stations are all\r\nstandard, but the completeness of the equipment varies according to the\r\nimportance of the station. The 8 A.M. observations are the only ones now\r\ngenerally used in the preparation of weather maps. When the Weather\r\nService was first established, tri-daily charts were for some time issued\r\nfrom the central office in Washington. On April 1, 1888, the number was\r\nreduced to two a day, and on Sept. 30, 1895, a further change was made,\r\nand now there is but one map a day.\r\n\r\nThe 8 A.M. observations, as soon as made, are corrected for certain\r\ninstrumental errors, and the barometer readings are reduced to sea level.\r\nThe data are then put into cipher, not for secrecy, but to facilitate\r\ntransmission and to lessen the chances of error, and are telegraphed from\r\nall parts of the country to the central office of the Weather Bureau in\r\nWashington. Besides sending their own messages to Washington, all the\r\nimportant stations of the Weather Bureau receive, by a carefully devised\r\nsystem of telegraphic circuits, a sufficient number of the reports from\r\nother stations to enable their observers to draw and issue local weather\r\nmaps.\r\n\r\nThe observations are received at the central office of the Weather Bureau\r\nin Washington by special wires, and are usually all there within an hour\r\nafter the readings were made. As the messages are received in the forecast\r\nroom, they are translated from the cipher back again into the original\r\nform, and the data are entered upon blank maps. The official charged with\r\nmaking the forecasts then draws upon the maps lines of equal temperature,\r\nlines of equal pressure, lines of equal pressure-change and\r\ntemperature-change during the past 24 hours. These several sets of lines,\r\ntogether with those showing the regions of precipitation during the past\r\n24 hours, furnish the necessary data on which the forecasts can be based.\r\nIn other words, the forecast official has before him, on the several maps,\r\na bird’s-eye view of the weather conditions over the United States as they\r\nwere an hour before, and also of the changes that have taken place in\r\nthese conditions during the preceding 24 hours. Thus, by knowing the\r\ngeneral laws which govern the movements of areas of high and low\r\ntemperature, of fair and stormy weather, across the country, he can make a\r\nprediction as to the probable conditions which any state or section of the\r\ncountry will experience in 12, 24, or 36 hours.\r\n\r\nIn a later chapter some suggestions will be given for studies of\r\nforecasting.\r\n\r\nThe forecasts made in Washington, and printed on the Washington daily\r\nweather map, relate to all sections of the United States, and include\r\npredictions of cold waves, killing frosts, storm winds, river floods, and\r\nthe like, besides the ordinary changes in weather conditions. These\r\nforecasts, as soon as made, are at once given to the local newspapers and\r\nto the press associations. They are also sent by telegraph to all regular\r\nstations of the Weather Bureau, and to all stations at which cautionary or\r\nstorm signals are to be displayed, along the Atlantic or Gulf coasts, and\r\non the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe Washington weather map is about 24 by 16 inches in size, and is newly\r\nlithographed each day. The total number of maps issued from the central\r\noffice during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, was 310,250. In\r\naddition to these, there are now 84 stations of the Weather Bureau in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, at which daily weather maps are issued and\r\nlocal forecasts made. These latter forecasts are made by a corps of local\r\nforecast officials, each of whom has to make the weather prediction for\r\nhis own district. At first, and until within a few years, one predicting\r\nofficer in Washington made all the forecasts for the country, but it was\r\nfound better to have the country divided into geographical sections, over\r\neach one of which the meteorological conditions are fairly similar, and to\r\nhave a local forecast official in charge of each section. These local\r\nforecast officials have the double advantage of being able to study the\r\nweather conditions over the whole country, as sent them by telegraph each\r\nmorning, and also of knowing the special peculiarities of their own\r\nregions. This enables them to make more accurate predictions than can be\r\nmade by an official who may be one or two thousand miles distant, in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the maps issued at the map stations outside of\r\nWashington are prepared by what is known as the chalk-plate process,\r\nsuggested by Mr. J. W. Smith, local forecast official at Boston. This\r\nprocess is as follows: A thin covering of specially prepared chalk, 1/8 of\r\nan inch in thickness, is spread upon a steel plate of the size of the\r\nprospective weather map. On this chalk are engraved, by means of suitable\r\ninstruments, the various weather symbols, the lines of equal pressure and\r\nof equal temperature, and the wind arrows. The plate is then stereotyped\r\nin the ordinary way, and printed on a sheet prepared for the purpose,\r\nwhich has a blank outline map of the United States at the top, and space\r\nin the lower half for the forecasts, summary, and tables.\r\n\r\nThe size of the chalk-plate map itself is 10 by 6-1/2 inches; the size of\r\nthe whole sheet, which includes also the text and tables, 16 by 11 inches.\r\nWeather maps prepared by the chalk-plate process are now issued from 28 of\r\nthe 84 stations which publish daily maps. At the remaining stations the\r\nmaps are prepared by a stencil process, the size of the map being 13-1/2\r\nby 22 inches. The total number of weather maps issued at the various\r\nstations during the fiscal year 1897-1898 was 5,239,300.\r\n\r\nBesides recording the usual meteorological data, and publishing weather\r\nmaps and forecasts, the various stations of the Weather Bureau serve as\r\ndistributing centers for cold wave, frost, flood, and storm warnings.\r\nThese warnings are promptly sent out by telegraph, telephone, and mail.\r\nBesides these usual methods of distributing forecasts, other means have\r\nalso been adopted. In some places factory whistles are employed to inform\r\nthose within hearing as to the coming weather; railway trains are provided\r\nwith flags, whose various colors announce to those who are near the train\r\nfair or stormy weather, rising or falling temperature; and at numerous\r\nso-called “display stations,” scattered all over the country, the\r\nforecasts are widely disseminated by means of flags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                              TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Lines of Equal Temperature.=——Temperature is the most important of\r\nall the weather elements. It is therefore with a study of the distribution\r\nof temperature over the United States, and of the manner of representing\r\nthat distribution, that we begin our exercises in map drawing. In carrying\r\nout the work we shall proceed in a way similar to that adopted by the\r\nofficials of the Weather Bureau in Washington and at the other\r\nmap-publishing stations over the country.\r\n\r\nEnter on a blank weather map the temperature readings found in the first\r\ncolumn of the table in Chapter VIII. These readings are given in degrees\r\nof the ordinary Fahrenheit scale [those which are preceded by the minus\r\nsign (-) being below zero], and were made at the same time (7 A.M.,\r\n“Eastern Standard Time”) all over the United States. Make your figures\r\nsmall but distinct, and place them close to the different stations to\r\nwhich they belong. This is done every morning at the Weather Bureau in\r\nWashington, when the telegraphic reports of weather conditions come in\r\nfrom all over the country. When all the temperature readings have been\r\nentered on the outline map, you have before you a view of the actual\r\ntemperature distribution over the United States at 7 A.M., on the first\r\nday of the series. Describe the distribution of temperature in general\r\nterms, comparing and contrasting the different sections of the country in\r\nrespect to their temperature conditions. Where are the lowest\r\ntemperatures? Where are the highest? What was the lowest thermometer\r\nreading recorded anywhere on the morning of this day? At what station was\r\nthis reading made? What was the highest temperature recorded? And at what\r\nstation was this reading made?\r\n\r\nNotice that the warmest districts on the map are in Florida, along the\r\nGulf Coast, and along the coast of California. The marked contrasts in\r\ntemperature between the Northwest and the Pacific and Gulf Coasts at once\r\nsuggest a reason why Florida and Southern California are favorite winter\r\nresorts. To these favored districts great numbers of people who wish to\r\nescape the severe cold of winter in the Northern States travel every\r\nyear, and here they enjoy mild temperature and prevailingly sunny\r\nweather. To the cold Northwest, on the other hand, far from the warm\r\nwaters of the Pacific, where the days are short and the sun stands low in\r\nthe sky, no seekers after health travel. This annual winter migration\r\nfrom the cities of the North to Florida and Southern California has led\r\nto the building of great hotels in favored locations in these States, and\r\nduring the winter and spring fast express trains, splendidly equipped,\r\nare run from north to south and from south to north along the Atlantic\r\nCoast to accommodate the great numbers of travelers between New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, Chicago, and other large northern cities, and the\r\nFlorida winter resorts. Southern California also is rapidly developing as\r\na winter resort, and rivals the far-famed Riviera of Southern Europe as a\r\nmild and sunny retreat from the severe climates of the more northern\r\nlatitudes. The control which meteorological conditions exercise over\r\ntravel and over habitability is thus clearly shown. Florida and Southern\r\nCalifornia are also regions in which, owing to the mildness of their\r\nwinter climates, certain fruits, such as oranges and lemons, which are\r\nnot found elsewhere in the country, can be grown out of doors, and these\r\nare shipped to all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nLet us take another step in order to emphasize more clearly the\r\ndistribution of temperature over the United States on the first day of our\r\nseries. Draw a line which shall separate all places having a temperature\r\n_above_ 30° from those having temperatures _below_ 30°, 30° being nearly\r\nthe freezing point and, therefore, a critical temperature. Evidently this\r\nwill help us to make our description of the temperature distribution more\r\ndetailed. If this line is to separate places having temperatures _above_\r\n30° from those having temperatures _below_ 30°, it must evidently pass\r\nthrough all places whose temperature is exactly 30°. Examine the\r\nthermometer readings entered on your map to see whether there are any\r\nwhich indicate exactly 30°. You will find this reading at Norfolk, Va.,\r\nWilmington, S. C., Atlanta, Ga., Chattanooga, Tenn., Ft. Smith, Ark., and\r\nPortland, Ore. Through all these stations the line of 30° must be drawn.\r\nBegin the line on the Atlantic Coast at Norfolk, Va., and draw it wherever\r\nyou find a thermometer reading of 30°. It is best to trace the line\r\nfaintly with pencil at first, so that any mistakes can be easily\r\nrectified, and it should be drawn in smooth curves, not in angles. From\r\nNorfolk the line must run southwest through Wilmington, and then westward\r\nthrough Atlanta, passing just north of Augusta, which has 31°. From\r\nAtlanta the line goes northwest through Chattanooga, and thence westward,\r\ncurving south of Memphis (28°) and Little Rock (26°), and then\r\nnorthwestward again through Ft. Smith.\r\n\r\nIn fixing the _exact_ position of the 30° line south of Memphis and Little\r\nRock, the following considerations must be our guide: Memphis has 28°;\r\nVicksburg has 35°. Neither of these stations has 30°. Suppose, however,\r\nthat you had started from Memphis, with a thermometer, and had traveled\r\nvery rapidly to Vicksburg. The thermometer reading at starting in Memphis\r\nwould have been 28°, and at the end of your journey in Vicksburg it would\r\nhave been 35°, presuming that no change in temperature at either station\r\ntook place during the journey. Evidently the mercury rose during the\r\njourney, and in rising from 28° to 35° it must, somewhere on the way, have\r\nstood at exactly 30°. Now this place, where the temperature was exactly\r\n30°, is the point through which our 30° line ought to pass. How are we to\r\ndetermine its location? Assume, as is always done in such cases, that the\r\ntemperature increased at a uniform rate between Memphis and Vicksburg. The\r\ntotal rise was from 28° to 35° = 7°. In order to find a temperature 7°\r\nhigher than at Memphis, you had to travel the whole distance from Memphis\r\nto Vicksburg. Suppose you had only wished to find a temperature 5° higher.\r\nThen, assuming a uniform rate of increase between the two stations, you\r\nwould have had to travel only 5/7 of the distance, and your thermometer at\r\nthat place would have read 28° + 5° = 33°. But assume you had wanted to\r\nfind the place where the thermometer stood at 30°. In this case you would\r\nhave been obliged to go but 2/7 of the total distance from Memphis to\r\nVicksburg, and at that point your thermometer reading would have been 28°\r\n+ 2° = 30°, which is the point we wish to find. In this way, then, when we\r\ndo not find the _exact_ temperature we are looking for on the map, we can\r\ncalculate where that temperature prevails by noting places which have\r\ntemperatures somewhat higher and somewhat lower, and proceeding as in the\r\ncase just described. Take another example. Little Rock, Ark., has 26°;\r\nShreveport, La., has 40°. 40° - 26° = 14°, which is the total difference.\r\nFrom 26° to 30° is 4°. Therefore a point 4/14 or 2/7 of the distance from\r\nLittle Rock to Shreveport should have a temperature of 26° + 4° = 30°,\r\nwhich is the point we wish to find, and through which our 30° line must\r\npass.\r\n\r\nFrom Ft. Smith the line cannot go north or northwest or west, because the\r\ntemperatures there are all below 30°. To the south the temperatures are\r\nall above 30°. Evidently there is only one direction in which you can\r\nprolong the line, and that is to the southwest. Temperatures of 30° cannot\r\nbe found north of El Paso (28°), because there the temperature distinctly\r\nfalls, Santa Fé having 4°, Denver, -14°, and Cheyenne, -23°. Therefore\r\ntemperatures _above_ 28° must be found south of El Paso. From Ft. Smith\r\nyou may, therefore, continue the 30° line southwest and west, passing\r\nclose to El Paso, but to the south of it. In determining the further\r\ncourse of the 30° line, note that Yuma and all the California stations\r\nhave temperatures above 30°, while Winnemucca, Nev., has 13°, and\r\nPortland, Ore., has exactly 30°. From El Paso you may, therefore, continue\r\nthe line to the northwest, passing up through Central California parallel\r\nwith the coast line, and to the east of all the California stations and of\r\nRoseburg, Ore., and thence running through Portland, Ore., ending just\r\nwest of Seattle, Wash. Notice that the 30° line should be nearer to\r\nSacramento, Cal., with 36°, than to Red Bluff with 44°.\r\n\r\nThus you have drawn the line which passes through all places that have a\r\ntemperature of 30° on the map under discussion. This may be called _a line\r\nof equal temperature_. _Isotherm_, a compound of two Greek words meaning\r\n_equal temperature_, is the name given in meteorology to such lines as\r\nthis. You have drawn the isotherm of 30°. All parts of the United States\r\nnorth and east of this line are below 30°, while all districts south and\r\nwest of it are above 30°. You see, therefore, how much easier the drawing\r\nof this one line has made the description of the temperature distribution\r\nover the United States.\r\n\r\nCarry this process a step further by drawing the line which shall pass\r\nthrough all places with a temperature of 40°. This line begins at\r\nJacksonville, Fla. (40°), and runs west, passing between Montgomery, Ala.\r\n(33°), and Pensacola, Fla. (46°). Thence it turns to the northwest,\r\npassing between Vicksburg, Miss. (35°), and New Orleans, La. (48°), and\r\nthrough Shreveport, La. (40°). From Shreveport it turns to the southwest,\r\npassing to the north and west of Palestine, Tex. (46°), and down through\r\nSan Antonio, Tex. (40°). Its further exact location cannot be determined\r\nin Mexico, because there are no observations from Mexican stations, but\r\nthe readings at Yuma, Ariz. (41°), and at San Diego (42°), Los Angeles\r\n(44°), San Francisco (45°), Red Bluff (44°), and Cape Mendocino (43°), all\r\nin California, show that the 40° isotherm may be started again just north\r\nof Yuma, and may be carried up through California, nearly parallel with\r\nthe Pacific Coast, ending between Cape Mendocino, Cal. (43°), and\r\nRoseburg, Ore. (37°). You have now drawn the isotherms of 30° and of 40°,\r\nand in order to avoid confusion, mark the ends of the first line 30° and\r\nthe ends of the second line 40°.\r\n\r\nIsotherms on weather maps are drawn for every even 10° of temperature.\r\nThey are drawn in smooth curves and not in angular sections. Two isotherms\r\ncannot cross one another, for if they did you would have two temperatures,\r\ndiffering by 10°, at the point of crossing, which is obviously impossible.\r\nComplete the chart for this day by drawing the remaining isotherms,\r\n_i.e._, those for 50°, 20°, 10°, 0°, -10°, -20°, and -30°, bearing in mind\r\nwhat has been said in regard to the determination of the positions of\r\nisotherms when the _exact_ temperature you are seeking is not given on the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nThe dotted lines in Fig. 18 show the positions of the isotherms when\r\ndrawn. Notice how clearly the temperature distribution now stands out, and\r\nhow simple the description of that distribution has become. Observe that\r\nthe isotherms, although more or less irregular, show a good deal of\r\nuniformity in their general courses, and this uniformity is a great\r\nassistance in drawing them. Study the distribution of temperature on this\r\nmap, and the positions of the isotherms, very carefully.\r\n\r\nConstruct isothermal charts for the remaining days of the series. Use a\r\nnew blank map for each day, and take the temperature observations from\r\nthe table in Chapter VIII. Proceed as in the case of the first day. Draw\r\nthe isotherms for every even 10° of temperature, taking care to study the\r\ncourse of each line before you begin to draw the line. The charts when\r\ncompleted form a series in which the temperature distribution over the\r\nUnited States is shown at successive intervals of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.——Isotherms. First day.]\r\n\r\nIn order to bring out the temperature distribution on the maps more\r\nclearly, color (with colored pencils or water colors) all that portion of\r\neach map which lies within the -20° isotherm a dark blue; that portion\r\nwhich is between the 0° isotherm and the -20° isotherm a somewhat lighter\r\nshade of blue, and those districts which are between 0° and +30° a still\r\nlighter blue. The portion of the map above 30° and below 40° may be left\r\nuncolored, while the districts having temperatures over 40° may be colored\r\nred. In the map for the third day the district which has temperatures\r\nbelow -50° should be colored darker blue than any shade used on the other\r\nmaps, or black, in order to emphasize the extremely low temperatures\r\nthere found. Figs. 19-24, on which the isotherms are shown, also\r\nillustrate the appearance of these maps when the different temperature\r\nareas are colored, as has been suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.——Temperature. First Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.——Temperature. Second Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.——Temperature. Third Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.——Temperature. Fourth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.——Temperature. Fifth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.——Temperature. Sixth Day.]\r\n\r\nStudy the maps individually at first. Describe the temperature\r\ndistribution on each map. Ask yourself the following questions in each\r\ncase: Where is it coldest? Where warmest? What is the lowest temperature\r\non the map? What is the highest? At what stations were these readings\r\nmade?\r\n\r\nThen compare the successive maps and answer these questions: What changes\r\nhave taken place in the intervening 24 hours? In what districts has the\r\ntemperature risen? What is the greatest rise that has occurred? Where? In\r\nwhat districts has the temperature fallen? What was the greatest fall in\r\ntemperature and where did it occur? Has the temperature remained nearly\r\nstationary in any districts? In which? You will find it a help in\r\nanswering such questions to make out a table of all the stations, and to\r\nindicate in columns, after the names of the stations, the number of\r\ndegrees of rise or fall in temperature at each place during the 24-hour\r\ninterval between the successive maps. When the temperature is higher at\r\nany station than it was on the preceding day, note this by writing a plus\r\nsign (+) before the number of degrees of rise in temperature. When the\r\ntemperature has fallen, put a minus sign (-) before the number of degrees\r\nof fall. Thus, New Orleans, La., had a temperature of 48° on the first\r\nday. On the second it had 33°. Therefore the change at New Orleans was\r\n-15° in the 24 hours. At Key West, Fla., the change was +11° in the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWrite a brief account of the temperature distribution on each day of the\r\nseries, and of the changes which took place between that day and the one\r\npreceding, naming the districts and States over which the most marked\r\nfalls and rises in temperature occurred, with some indication of the\r\namount of these changes. Note especially the changes in position, and the\r\nextent, of the districts with temperatures below -20°; between 0° and\r\n-20°, and between 30° and 0°. Write out a clear, concise statement of the\r\ntemperature distribution and changes shown on the whole set of six maps.\r\n\r\n=Cold Waves.=——The series of charts for these six days furnishes an\r\nexcellent illustration of a severe cold wave.\r\n\r\nA _cold wave_, as the term is now used by the Weather Bureau, means,\r\nduring December, January, and February, a fall in temperature of from 20°\r\nto 16° in 24 hours, with a resulting reduction of temperature to between\r\n0° and 32°, and, during the months from March to November inclusive, a\r\nfall of from 20° to 16° in 24 hours, with a reduction of temperature from\r\n16° to 36°. During December, January, and February a _cold wave_ means\r\nthe following falls and reductions of temperature. Over the Northwestern\r\nStates, from western Wisconsin to Montana, including Wyoming, Nebraska,\r\nand western Iowa, and over northeastern New York and northern New\r\nHampshire, northern Vermont and northern Maine, a fall of 20° or more to\r\nzero or below; over southern New England and adjoining districts, the\r\nLake region, the central valleys and west to Colorado, including northern\r\nNew Mexico and northwestern Texas, a fall of 20° or more to 10° or below;\r\nover southern New Jersey, Delaware, eastern Maryland, Virginia, western\r\nNorth Carolina, northwestern South Carolina, northern Georgia, northern\r\nAlabama, northern Mississippi, Tennessee, southern Kentucky, Arkansas,\r\nOklahoma, and southern New Mexico, a fall of 20° or more to 20° or below;\r\nover eastern North Carolina, central South Carolina, central Georgia,\r\ncentral Alabama, central Mississippi, central and northern Louisiana and\r\ncentral and interior Texas, a fall of 18° or more to 25° or below; along\r\nthe Gulf coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, over all\r\nof Florida, and over the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, a fall of\r\n16° or more to 32° or below. From March to November inclusive a _cold\r\nwave_ means falls of temperature of the same amounts over the same\r\ndistricts, with resulting temperatures of 16°, 24°, 28°, 32°, and 36°\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nNotice that the region from which the greatest cold came in this cold wave\r\nis Canada. In that northern country, with its short days and little\r\nsunshine, and its long, cold nights, everything is favorable to the\r\nproduction of very low temperatures.\r\n\r\nCold waves occur only in winter. In the summer cool spells, with similar\r\ncharacteristics, may be called _cool waves_.\r\n\r\n=Cold-Wave Forecasts.=——A severe cold wave in winter does much damage to\r\nfruit and crops growing out of doors in our Southern States, and to\r\nperishable food products in cars, on the way from the South to supply the\r\ngreat cities of the North. Therefore it is important that warnings should\r\nbe issued giving early information of the coming cold, so that farmers and\r\nfruit growers and shippers may take every precaution to protect their\r\ncrops and produce. Our Weather Bureau takes special pains to study the\r\nmovements of cold waves and to make forecasts of them, and so well are the\r\nwarnings distributed over the country that the fruit growers and the\r\ntransportation companies, and the dealers in farm produce, are able every\r\nwinter to save thousands of dollars’ worth of fruit and vegetables which\r\nwould otherwise be lost. Cold-wave warnings are heeded by many persons\r\nbesides those who are directly interested in fruits and farm products. The\r\nranchmen in the West, with thousands of cattle under their charge; the\r\ntrainmen in charge of cattle trains; the engineers of large buildings,\r\nsuch as hotels, stores, and office buildings, who must have their fires\r\nhotter in cold weather,——these and many more watch, and are governed by,\r\nthe cold-wave forecasts of our Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\n=Mean Annual and Mean Monthly Isothermal Charts.=——We have thus far\r\nconsidered isothermal charts for the United States only, based on the\r\ntemperature observations made at a single moment of time. It is, of\r\ncourse, possible to draw isothermal charts, the data for which are not\r\nthe temperatures at a given moment, but are the mean or average\r\ntemperatures for a month or a year. Such charts have been constructed for\r\nother countries besides our own, as well as for the whole world. An\r\nisothermal chart based on the mean annual temperatures is known as a\r\n_mean annual isothermal chart_. These charts show at once the average\r\ndistribution of temperature for the month or for the year, just as the\r\nones we have drawn show the distribution of temperature over the United\r\nStates at a single moment.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Direction and Rate of Temperature Decrease. Temperature\r\nGradient.=——Take your isothermal map for the first day and imagine\r\nyourself at Kansas City, Mo. In what direction must you go from Kansas\r\nCity in order to enter most rapidly into colder weather? In what direction\r\nmust you go from Kansas City in order to enter most rapidly into warmer\r\nweather? Take the case of Salt Lake City. In what direction must you go\r\nfrom that station in order to enter most rapidly into colder weather? Into\r\nwarmer weather? What are the corresponding directions in the case of\r\nSpokane, Wash.? Of Bismarck, N. Dak.? Of Buffalo, N. Y.? Of Montreal,\r\nQue.? Of Portland, Me.? Of Sacramento, Cal.?\r\n\r\nDraw a line from Kansas City to the nearest point at which there is a\r\ntemperature 10° lower than at Kansas City. Evidently this point is on the\r\nisotherm of 0°, and will be found if a line be drawn from Kansas City\r\ntowards, and at right angles to, the isotherm of 0°. Continue the line\r\nbeyond the 0° isotherm in the direction of still lower temperatures,\r\n_i.e._, to the isotherms of -10°, -20°, and -30°. Beyond the isotherm of\r\n-30° the line must stop. Draw similar lines from Seattle, Wash.; Salt Lake\r\nCity, Utah; Denver, Col.; St. Paul, Minn.; Cleveland, O.; and New York, N.\r\nY. Prolong these lines all across the map, so that they will extend from\r\nthe regions of highest temperature to those of the lowest. A number of\r\nintermediate lines may also be added. Note that the various directions\r\nfollowed by these lines are square to, or at right angles to, the\r\nsuccessive isotherms, and that although the lines all run from higher to\r\nlower temperatures, they do not all trend in the same direction. These\r\nlines may be called _lines of decrease of temperature_. Fig. 25 shows a\r\nfew of these lines of decrease of temperature drawn for the first day.\r\n\r\nDraw similar lines on the other isothermal charts, for the same stations.\r\nAre the directions of temperature decrease the same on these charts as on\r\nthe chart for the first day, for Kansas City, Seattle, Salt Lake City,\r\nDenver, St. Paul, Cleveland, New York? Draw lines of decrease of\r\ntemperature from the following additional stations: Key West, Fla.; New\r\nOrleans, La.; Charleston, S. C.; El Paso, Tex.; San Diego, Cal.; Hatteras,\r\nN. C.\r\n\r\nCompare the directions of these lines on the different days. How do they\r\nchange from one day to the next?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.——Temperature Gradients. First Day.]\r\n\r\nNext select some line of decrease of temperature on the map for the first\r\nday which begins in Texas, and follow it northward. Where, along this\r\nline, is the decrease of temperature most rapid? Evidently this must be\r\nwhere the isotherms are closest together, because every isotherm that is\r\ncrossed means a change of temperature of 10°, and the more isotherms there\r\nare in a given distance, the more rapidly the temperature is changing.\r\nWhere the isotherms are closest together, a given decrease of temperature\r\nis passed over in the least distance, or, conversely, a greater decrease\r\nof temperature is experienced in a given distance. Study this question of\r\nrapidity or slowness of temperature decrease on the whole series of\r\ncharts. On which of the charts, and where, do you find the most rapid\r\ndecrease? The slowest decrease? Is there any regularity in these _rates_\r\nof temperature decrease either on one map or in the whole series of maps?\r\n\r\nThe term _temperature gradient_ is used by meteorologists to describe the\r\n_direction_ and _rate of temperature decrease_ which we have been\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\nIf we are to compare these rates of temperature change, we must have some\r\ndefinite scale of measurement. Thus, for example, in speaking of the wind\r\nvelocity we say the velocity of the wind is so many miles per hour; in\r\ndescribing the grade of a railroad we say it is so many feet in a mile. In\r\ndealing with these temperature changes, we adopt a similar scheme. We say:\r\nThe rate of temperature decrease is so many degrees Fahrenheit in a\r\ndistance of one latitude degree (about 70 miles). In order to make our\r\nmeasurements, we use a scale of _latitude degrees_, just as, in\r\ncalculating railroad grades, we must have a way to measure the miles of\r\ntrack in which the ascent or descent of the roadbed is so many feet. Take\r\na strip of paper 6 inches long, with a straight edge, and lay this edge\r\nnorth and south at the middle of the weather map, along a longitudinal or\r\nmeridian line. Mark off on the strip of paper the points where any two\r\nlatitude lines cross the meridian line. These latitude lines are five\r\n(latitude) degrees apart. Therefore divide the space between them on your\r\npaper into five divisions, and each of these will measure just one\r\nlatitude degree. Continue making divisions of the same size until you have\r\nten altogether on the strip of paper. Select, on any weather map, some\r\nstation lying between two isotherms at which you wish to measure the rate\r\nof temperature decrease. Take, for instance, Buffalo, N. Y., on the first\r\nday. What you want to find is this: What is the _rate of temperature\r\ndecrease_, or the _temperature gradient_, at Buffalo? Lay your paper scale\r\nof latitude degrees through Buffalo, from the isotherm of 10° to the\r\nisotherm of 0°, and as nearly as possible at right angles to the\r\nisotherms.[3] Count the number of latitude degrees on your scale between\r\nthe isotherms of 10° and 0°, on a line running through Buffalo. There are,\r\nroughly, about two degrees of latitude in this distance. That is, in the\r\ndistrict in which Buffalo lies, the temperature is changing _at the rate_\r\nof 10° Fahrenheit (between isotherms 10° and 0°) in two latitude degrees.\r\nAs our standard of measurement is the amount of change of temperature in\r\none latitude degree, we divide the 10 (the number of degrees of\r\ntemperature) by the 2 (the number of degrees of latitude), which gives us\r\n5 as the rate of decrease of temperature per latitude degree at Buffalo,\r\nN. Y., at 7 A.M., on the first day of the series. The temperature gradient\r\nat Buffalo is therefore 5. The rule may be stated as follows: Select the\r\nstation for which you wish to know the rate of temperature decrease or\r\ntemperature gradient. Lay a scale of latitude degrees through the station,\r\nand as nearly as possible at right angles to the adjacent isotherms. If\r\nthe station is exactly on an isotherm then measure the distance _from_ the\r\nstation to the nearest isotherm indicating a temperature 10° lower. The\r\nscale must, however, be laid perpendicularly to the isotherm, as before.\r\nDivide the number of degrees of difference of temperature between the\r\nisotherms (always 10°) by the distance (in latitude degrees) between the\r\nisotherms, and the quotient is the _rate of temperature decrease per\r\nlatitude degree_. Or, to formulate the operation:\r\n\r\n                              _R = T / D_,\r\n\r\nin which _R_ = rate; _T_ = temperature difference between isotherms\r\n(always 10°), and _D_ = distance between isotherms in latitude degrees.\r\nThus, a distance of 10 latitude degrees gives a rate of 1; a distance of 5\r\ngives a rate of 2; a distance of 2 gives a rate of 5; a distance of 4\r\ngives a rate of 2.5, etc.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Unless the isotherms are exactly parallel, the scale cannot\r\nbe at right angles to both of them. It should, however, be placed as\r\nnearly as possible in that position.]\r\n\r\nDetermine the rates of temperature decrease in the following cases:——\r\n\r\n_A._ For a considerable number of stations in different parts of the same\r\nmap, as for each of the six days of the series.\r\n\r\nAnd, using the school file of weather maps,\r\n\r\n_B._ For one station during a winter month and during a summer month,\r\nmeasuring the rate on each map throughout the month and obtaining an\r\naverage rate for the month.\r\n\r\n_C._ For a station on the Pacific Coast, and one on the Atlantic Coast\r\nduring the same months.\r\n\r\n_D._ For a station on the Gulf of Mexico, or in Florida, and one in the\r\nNorthwest during a winter month.\r\n\r\n_E._ For a station in the central United States, and one on the Pacific\r\nCoast, the Gulf Coast, and the Atlantic Coast, respectively, during\r\ndifferent months of the winter and summer.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the rates of temperature decrease under these\r\ndifferent conditions over the United States prepares us for an\r\nappreciation of the larger facts, of a similar kind, to be found on the\r\nmean annual and mean monthly isothermal charts of various countries, and\r\nalso of the whole world.\r\n\r\n=Temperature Gradients on Isothermal Charts of the Globe.=——The mean\r\nannual isothermal charts of the globe (see page 63) bring out some very\r\nmarked contrasts in rates of temperature decrease. Thus, along the eastern\r\nside of the North American continent the isotherms are crowded close\r\ntogether, while on the western coast of Europe they are spread far apart.\r\nBetween southern Florida and Maine there is the same change in mean annual\r\ntemperature as is found between the Atlantic coast of the Sahara and\r\ncentral England. The latter is a considerably longer distance, and this\r\nmeans that the decrease of temperature is much slower on the European\r\nAtlantic coast than on the North American Atlantic coast. In fact, the\r\nrate of temperature decrease with latitude in the latter case is the most\r\nrapid anywhere in the world, in the same distance. These great\r\ncontrasts in temperature which occur within short distances along the\r\neastern coast of North America have had great influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of this region, as has been pointed out by Woeikof, an eminent\r\nRussian meteorologist. The products of the tropics and of the Arctic are\r\nhere brought very near together; and at the same time intercommunication\r\nbetween these two regions of widely differing climates is very easy.\r\nLabrador is climatically an Arctic land, and man is there forced to seek\r\nhis food chiefly in the sea, for nature supplies him with little on shore,\r\nwhile southern Florida is quite tropical in its temperature conditions and\r\nin the abundance of its vegetation. Between the Pacific coasts of Asia and\r\nof North America there is a similar but less pronounced contrast, the\r\nisotherms being crowded together on the eastern coast of China and\r\nSiberia, and being spread apart as they cross the Pacific Ocean and reach\r\nour Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nIn general, we naturally expect to find that the temperature decreases as\r\none goes poleward from the equator; from lower latitudes, where the sun is\r\nalways high in the heavens, to higher latitudes, where it is near the\r\nhorizon, and its warming effect is less. But there are some curious\r\nexceptions to this general rule. The lowest temperatures on the January\r\nisothermal chart (-60°) are found in northeastern Siberia, and not, so far\r\nas our observations go, near the North Pole. If you find yourself at this\r\n“cold pole,” as it is called, in Siberia in January, you can reach higher\r\ntemperatures by traveling north, south, east, or west. In other words,\r\nhere is a case of _increase_ of temperature in a _northerly_ direction, as\r\nwell as east, south, and west. Again, there is a district of high\r\ntemperature (90°) over southern Asia in July, from which you can travel\r\nsouth towards the equator and yet reach lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn our winter months the contrasts of temperature in the United States\r\nare, as a rule, violent, there being great differences between the cold of\r\nthe Northwest and the mild air of Florida and the Gulf States. In the\r\nsummer, on the other hand, the distribution of temperature is relatively\r\nequable, the isotherms being, as a rule, far apart. In summer, therefore,\r\nwe approach the conditions characteristic of the Torrid Zone. These are\r\nuniformly high temperatures over large areas. The same thing, on a larger\r\nscale, is seen over the whole Northern Hemisphere. During our winter\r\nmonths the isotherms are a good deal closer together than they are during\r\nthe summer, or, in more technical language, the temperature\r\ngradient between the equator and the North Pole is steeper in winter than\r\nin summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                                 WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observational work already done, whether non-instrumental or\r\ninstrumental, has shown that there is a close relation between the\r\n_direction of the wind_ at any station and the _temperature_ at that\r\nstation. Our second step in weather-map drawing is concerned with the\r\nwinds on the same series of maps which we have thus far been studying from\r\nthe point of view of temperature alone.\r\n\r\nIn the second column of the table in Chapter VIII are given the wind\r\ndirections and the wind velocities (in miles per hour) recorded at the\r\nWeather Bureau stations at 7 A.M., on the first day of the series. Enter\r\non a blank weather map, at each station for which a wind observation is\r\ngiven in the table, a small arrow flying _with_ the wind, _i.e._, pointing\r\nin the direction _towards_ which the wind is blowing. Make the lengths of\r\nthe wind arrows roughly proportionate to the velocity of the wind, the\r\nwinds of higher velocities being distinguished by longer arrows, and those\r\nof lower velocities by shorter arrows. The letters _Lt._ (= light) in the\r\ntable denote wind velocities of 5 miles, or less, per hour.\r\n\r\nWhen you have finished drawing these arrows, you will have before you a\r\npicture of the wind directions and velocities all over the United States\r\nat the time of the morning observation on this day. (See solid arrows in\r\nFig. 26.)\r\n\r\nThe wind arrows on your map show the wind directions at only a few\r\nscattered points as compared with the vast extent of the United States. We\r\nmust remember that the whole lower portion of the atmosphere is moving,\r\nand not merely the winds at these scattered stations. It will help you to\r\nget a clearer picture of this actual movement of the atmosphere as a\r\nwhole, if you draw some additional wind arrows between the stations of\r\nobservation, but in sympathy with the observed wind directions given in\r\nthe table and already entered on your map. These new arrows may be drawn\r\nin broken lines, and may be curved to accord in direction with the\r\nsurrounding wind arrows. Heavier or longer lines may be used to indicate\r\nfaster winds. (See broken arrows, Fig. 26.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.——Winds. First Day.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the general winds must move in broad sweeping paths,\r\nchanging their directions gradually, rather than in narrow belts, with\r\nsudden changes in direction. Therefore long curving arrows give a better\r\npicture of the actual drift of the atmospheric currents than do short,\r\nstraight, disconnected arrows.\r\n\r\nStudy the winds on this chart with care. Describe the conditions of wind\r\ndistribution in a general way. Can you discover any apparent relation\r\nbetween the different wind directions in any part of the map? Is there\r\nany system whatever in the winds? Write out a brief and concise\r\ndescription of the results of the study of this map.\r\n\r\nEnter on five other blank maps the wind directions given in the table in\r\nChapter VIII for the other five days of the series, making, as before, the\r\nlengths of the arrows roughly proportionate to the velocity of the wind,\r\nand adding extra broken arrows as suggested. (See Figs. 27-31.)\r\n\r\n_A._ Study the whole series of six maps. Describe the wind conditions on\r\neach map by itself, noting carefully any system in the wind circulation\r\nthat you may discover. Examine the wind velocities also. Are there any\r\ndistricts in which the velocities are especially high? Have these\r\nvelocities any relation to whatever wind systems you may have discovered?\r\nIf so, include in your description of these systems some consideration of\r\nthe wind _velocities_ as well as of the wind _directions_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.——Winds. Second Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.——Winds. Third Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.——Winds. Fourth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.——Winds. Fifth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.——Winds. Sixth Day.]\r\n\r\n_B._ Compare each map of the series with the map preceding it. Note what\r\nchanges in direction and velocity have taken place at individual\r\nstations. Group these changes as far as possible by the districts over\r\nwhich similar changes have occurred. Compare the wind systems on each map\r\nwith those on the map for the preceding day. Has there been any\r\nalteration in the position or relation of these systems? Write for each\r\nday an account of the conditions on that map, and of the changes that have\r\ntaken place in the preceding 24-hour interval.\r\n\r\n_C._ Write out a short connected account of the wind conditions and\r\nchanges illustrated on the whole set of six maps.\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we studied the progression of the cold wave of low\r\ntemperatures in an easterly direction across the United States. Notice now\r\nthe relation of the winds on the successive maps of our series to the\r\nmovement of the cold wave. Place your wind charts and isothermal charts\r\nfor the six days side by side, and study them together. The temperature\r\ndistribution on the second day differs from that on the first. What are\r\nthe chief differences? Examine the wind charts for these two days. Do you\r\ndetect any differences in the wind directions or systems on these days? Do\r\nthese differences help to explain some of the changes in temperature?\r\n\r\nCompare the temperature distribution on the second day with that on the\r\nthird. What are the most marked changes in the distribution? What changes\r\nin the winds on the corresponding wind maps seem to offer an explanation\r\nof these variations?\r\n\r\nProceed similarly with each map of the series. Formulate, in writing, the\r\ngeneral relation between winds and cold waves, discovered through your\r\nstudy of these charts.\r\n\r\n=Cold Waves in Other Countries.=——Cold waves in the United States come, as\r\nhas been seen, from the northwest, that being the region of greatest\r\nwinter cold. In Europe, cold waves come from the northeast. This is\r\nbecause northwest of Europe there is a large body of warm water supplied\r\nby the Gulf Stream drift, and therefore this is a source of warmth and not\r\nof cold. The cold region of Europe is to the northeast, over Russia and\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nCold waves have different names in different countries. In southern France\r\nthe cold wind from the north and northeast is known as the _mistral_,\r\nderived from the Latin word _magister_, meaning _master_, on account of\r\nits strength and violence. In Russia the name _buran_ or _purga_ is given\r\nto the cold wave when it blows along with it the fine dry snow\r\nfrom the surface of the ground. This _buran_ is apt to cause the loss of\r\nmany lives, both of men and cattle. In the Argentine Republic the coolest\r\nwind is from the southwest. It is known as a _pampero_, from the Spanish\r\n_pampa_, a _plain_.\r\n\r\n=Cyclones and Anticyclones.=——A system of winds blowing towards a common\r\ncenter (such as is well shown over the Gulf States on the weather map for\r\nthe second day, and over the middle Atlantic coast on the third day) is\r\ncalled by meteorologists a _cyclone_. The name was first suggested by\r\nPiddington early in this century. It is derived from the Greek word for\r\n_circle_, and hence it embodies the idea of a circular or spiral movement\r\nof the winds. A system of _outflowing_ winds, such as that over the\r\nnorthwestern United States shown on the maps for the first five days, and\r\nover the western Gulf States on the sixth day is called an _anticyclone_.\r\nThis name was proposed by Galton in 1863, and means the opposite of\r\n_cyclone_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                               PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Lines of Equal Pressure: Isobars.=——One of the most important\r\nweather elements is the _pressure_ of the atmosphere. This has already\r\nbeen briefly discussed in the sections on the mercurial barometer (Chapter\r\nII). It was there learned that atmospheric pressure is measured by the\r\nnumber of inches of mercury which the weight of the air will hold up in\r\nthe glass tube of the barometer. Our sensation of heat or cold gives us\r\nsome general idea as to the air temperature. We can tell the wind\r\ndirection when we know the points of the compass, and can roughly estimate\r\nits velocity. No instrumental aid is necessary to enable us to decide\r\nwhether a day is clear, fair or cloudy, or whether it is raining or\r\nsnowing. Unlike the temperature, the wind, or the weather, the pressure\r\ncannot be determined by our own senses without instrumental aid. The next\r\nweather element that we shall study is pressure.\r\n\r\nProceed as in the case of the thermometer readings. Enter upon a blank\r\nmap the barometer readings for the different stations given in the third\r\ncolumn of the table in Chapter VIII. When this has been done you have\r\nbefore you the actual pressure distribution over the United States at 7\r\nA.M., on the first day of the series. Describe the distribution of\r\npressure in general terms. Where is the pressure highest? Where lowest?\r\nWhat are the highest and the lowest readings of the barometer noted on the\r\nmap? What is the difference (in inches and hundredths) between these\r\nreadings?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.——Isobars. First Day.]\r\n\r\nDraw lines of equal pressure, following the same principles as were\r\nadopted in the case of the isotherms. The latter were drawn for every even\r\n10° of temperature. The former are to be drawn for every even .10 inch of\r\npressure. Every station which has a barometer reading of an even .10 inch\r\nwill be passed through by some line of equal pressure. Philadelphia, Pa.,\r\nwith 29.90 must be passed through by the 29.90 line; Wilmington, N. C.,\r\nwith 30.00, must have the 30.00 line passing through it, etc. Chicago,\r\nwith 30.17 inches, must lie between the lines of 30.10 and 30.20 inches,\r\nand nearer the latter than the former. Denver, Col., with 30.35 inches,\r\nmust lie midway between the 30.30 and 30.40 lines (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\nLines of equal pressure are called _isobars_, a word derived from two\r\nGreek words meaning _equal pressure_.\r\n\r\nDescribe the distribution of pressure as shown by the arrangement of the\r\nisobars. Note the differences in form between the isotherms and the\r\nisobars. The words _high_ and _low_ are printed on weather maps to mark\r\nthe regions where the pressure is highest and lowest.\r\n\r\nDraw isobars for the other days, using the barometer readings given in the\r\ntable in Chapter VIII. Figs. 33-38 show the arrangement of the isobars on\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nThe pressure charts may be colored, as indicated by the shading in these\r\nfigures, in order to bring out more clearly the distribution of pressure,\r\naccording to the same general scheme as that adopted in the temperature\r\ncharts. Color _brown_ all parts of your six isobaric charts over which the\r\npressures are below 29.50 inches; color _red_ all parts with pressure\r\nabove 30.00 inches. Use a _faint shade of brown_ for pressures between\r\n29.50 inches and 29.00 inches, and a _darker shade_ for pressures below\r\n29.00 inches. In the case of pressures over 30.00 inches, use a _pale red_\r\nfor pressures between 30.00 and 30.50 inches, and a _darker shade of red_\r\nfor pressures above 30.50 inches. By means of these colors the pressure\r\ndistribution will stand out very clearly. The scheme of color and shading\r\nmay, of course, be varied to suit the individual fancy.\r\n\r\nStudy the isobaric chart of each day of the series by itself at first.\r\nDescribe the pressure distribution on each chart.\r\n\r\nThen compare the successive charts. Note what changes have taken place in\r\nthe interval between each chart and the one preceding; where the pressures\r\nhave risen; where they have fallen, and where they have remained\r\nstationary. Write a brief account of the facts of pressure change\r\nillustrated on the whole series of six charts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.——Pressure. First Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.——Pressure. Second Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.——Pressure. Third Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.——Pressure. Fourth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.——Pressure. Fifth Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.——Pressure. Sixth Day.]\r\n\r\nCompare the charts of temperature and of pressure, first individually,\r\nthen collectively. What relations do you discover between temperature\r\ndistribution and pressure distribution on the isothermal and the isobaric\r\ncharts for the same day? What relations can you make out between the\r\nchanges in temperature and pressure distribution on successive days? On\r\nthe whole series of maps? Write out the results of your study concisely\r\nand clearly.\r\n\r\nCompare the wind charts and the pressure charts for the six days. Is there\r\nany relation between the direction and velocity of the winds and the\r\npressure? Observe carefully the changes in the winds from day to day on\r\nthese charts, and the changes in pressure distribution. Formulate and\r\nwrite out a brief general statement of all the relations that you have\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n=Mean Annual and Mean Monthly Isobaric Charts.=——We have thus far been\r\nstudying isobaric charts based on barometer readings made at a single\r\nmoment of time. Just as there are mean annual and mean monthly isothermal\r\ncharts, based on the mean annual and mean monthly temperatures, so there\r\nare mean annual and mean monthly isobaric charts for the different\r\ncountries and for the whole world, based on the mean annual and mean\r\nmonthly pressures. The mean annual and mean monthly isobaric charts of\r\nthe world show the presence of great oval areas of low and high pressure\r\ncovering a whole continent, or a whole ocean, and keeping about the same\r\nposition for months at a time. Thus, on the isobaric chart showing the\r\nmean pressure over the world in January, there are seen immense areas of\r\nhigh pressure (anticyclones) over the two great continental masses of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere. These anticyclonic areas, although vastly greater in\r\nextent than the small ones seen on the weather maps of the United States,\r\nhave the same system of spirally _outflowing_ winds. Over the\r\nnortheastern portion of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic, in\r\nJanuary, are seen immense areas of low pressure (cyclones) with spirally\r\n_inflowing_ winds. In July the northern continents are covered by\r\ncyclonic areas, and the central portion of the northern oceans by\r\nanticyclonic areas.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Direction and Rate of Pressure Decrease: Pressure Gradient.=——In\r\nChapter V we studied the direction and rate of temperature decrease, or\r\ntemperature gradient. We saw that the direction of this decrease varies in\r\ndifferent parts of the map, and that the rate, which depends upon the\r\ncloseness of the isotherms, also varies. An understanding of temperature\r\ngradients makes it easy to study the directions and rates of pressure\r\ndecrease, or _pressure gradients_, as they are commonly called. Examine\r\nthe series of isobaric charts to see how the lines of pressure decrease\r\nrun. Draw lines of pressure decrease for the six isobaric charts, as you\r\nhave already done on the isothermal charts. When the isobars are near\r\ntogether, the lines of pressure decrease may be drawn heavier, to indicate\r\na more rapid rate of decrease of pressure. Fig. 39 shows lines of pressure\r\ndecrease for the first day. Note how the arrangement and direction of\r\nthese lines change from one map to the next. Compare these lines with the\r\nlines of temperature decrease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.——Pressure Gradients. First Day.]\r\n\r\nNext study the _rate_ of pressure decrease. This rate depends upon the\r\ncloseness of the isobars, just as the rate of temperature decrease depends\r\nupon the closeness of the isotherms. Examine the rates of pressure\r\ndecrease upon the series of isobaric charts. On which charts do you find\r\nthe most rapid rate? Where? On which the slowest? Where? Do you discover\r\nany relation between rate of pressure decrease and the pressure itself?\r\nWhat relation?\r\n\r\nWhen expressed numerically, the barometric gradient is understood to mean\r\nthe number of hundredths of an inch of change of pressure in one latitude\r\ndegree. Prepare a scale of latitude degrees, and measure rates of pressure\r\ndecrease, just as you have already done in the case of temperature. In\r\nthis case, instead of dividing the difference in temperature between the\r\nisotherms (10° = _T_) by the distance between the isobars (_D_), we\r\nsubstitute for 10° of temperature .10 inch of pressure (_P_). Otherwise\r\nthe operation is precisely the same as described in Chapter V. The rule\r\nmay be stated as follows: Select the station for which you wish to know\r\nthe rate of pressure decrease or the barometric gradient. Lay your scale\r\nthrough the station, and as nearly as possible at right angles to the\r\nadjacent isobars. If the station is exactly on an isobar, then measure the\r\ndistance _from_ the station to the nearest isobar indicating a lower\r\npressure. The scale must, however, be laid perpendicularly to the isobars,\r\nas before. Divide the number of hundredths of an inch of pressure\r\ndifference between the isobars (always .10 inch) by the number expressing\r\nthe distance (in latitude degrees) between the isobars; the quotient is\r\nthe rate of pressure decrease per latitude degree. Or, to formulate the\r\noperation,\r\n\r\n                            _R_ = _P_ / _D_,\r\n\r\nin which _R_ = rate; _P_ = pressure difference between isobars (always .10\r\ninch), and _D_ = distance between the isobars in latitude degrees.\r\n\r\nDetermine the rates of pressure decrease in the following cases:——\r\n\r\n_A._ For a number of stations in different parts of the same map, as,\r\n_e.g._, Boston, New York, Washington, Charleston, New Orleans, St. Louis,\r\nSt. Paul, Denver, and on the same day.\r\n\r\n_B._ For one station during a winter month and during a summer month,\r\nmeasuring the rate on each map throughout the month, and obtaining an\r\naverage rate for the month.\r\n\r\nHave these gradients at the different stations any relation to the\r\nproximity of low or high pressure? To the velocity of the wind?\r\n\r\n=Pressure Gradients on Isobaric Charts of the Globe.=——The change from\r\nlow pressure to high pressure or _vice versa_ with the seasons, already\r\nnoted as being clearly shown on the isobaric charts of the globe,\r\nevidently means that the directions of pressure decrease must also change\r\nfrom season to season. The rates of pressure decrease likewise do not\r\nremain the same all over the world throughout the year. If we examine\r\nisobaric charts for January and July, we shall find that these gradients\r\nare stronger or steeper over the Northern Hemisphere in the former month\r\nthan in the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                                WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto nothing has been said about the _weather_ itself, as shown on the\r\nseries of maps we have been studying. By weather, in this connection, we\r\nmean the state of the sky, whether it is clear, fair, or cloudy, or\r\nwhether it is raining or snowing at the time of the observation. While it\r\nmakes not the slightest difference to our feelings whether the _pressure_\r\nis high or low, the _character of the weather_ is of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe character of the weather on each of the days whose temperature, wind,\r\nand pressure conditions we have been studying is noted in the table in\r\nthis chapter. The symbols used by the Weather Bureau to indicate the\r\ndifferent kinds of weather on the daily weather maps are as follows: [full\r\nmoon] clear; [quarter moon] fair, or partly cloudy; [new moon] cloudy;\r\n[circle-R] rain; [circle-S] snow.\r\n\r\nEnter on a blank map, at each station, the sign which indicates the\r\nweather conditions at that station at 7 A.M., on the first day, as given\r\nin the table. When you have completed this, you have before you on the map\r\na bird’s-eye view of the weather which prevailed over the United States at\r\nthe moment of time at which the observations were taken. Describe in\r\ngeneral terms the distribution of weather here shown, naming the districts\r\nor States over which similar conditions prevail. Following out the general\r\nscheme adopted in the case of the temperature and the pressure\r\ndistribution, separate, by means of a line drawn on your map, the\r\ndistricts over which the weather is prevailingly cloudy from those over\r\nwhich the weather is partly cloudy or clear. In drawing this line,\r\nscattering observations which do not harmonize with the prevailing\r\nconditions around them may be disregarded, as the object is simply to\r\nemphasize the _general_ characteristics. Enclose also, by means of another\r\nline, the general area over which it was snowing at the time of\r\nobservation, and shade or color the latter region differently from the\r\ncloudy one. Study the weather distribution shown on your chart. What\r\ngeneral relation do you discover between the kinds of weather and the\r\ntemperature, winds, and pressure?\r\n\r\nProceed similarly with the weather on the five remaining days, as noted in\r\nthe table. Enter the weather symbols for each day on a separate blank map,\r\nenclosing and shading or coloring the areas of cloud and of snow as above\r\nsuggested. In Figs. 40-45 the cloudy areas are indicated by single-line\r\nshading, and the snowy areas by double-line shading.\r\n\r\nNow study carefully each weather chart with its corresponding temperature,\r\nwind, and pressure charts. Note whatever relations you can discover among\r\nthe various meteorological elements on each day. Then compare the weather\r\nconditions on the successive maps. What changes do you note? How are these\r\nchanges related to the changes of temperature; of wind; of pressure?\r\nWrite a summary of the results derived from your study of these four sets\r\nof charts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.——Weather. First Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.——Weather. Second Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.——Weather. Third Day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.——Weather.

Sixth Day.]\r\n\r\n=The Weather of Temperate and Torrid Zones.=——The facts of the presence of\r\nclear weather in one region while snow is falling in another, and of the\r\nvariability of our weather from day to day in different parts of the\r\nUnited States, are emphasized by these charts of weather conditions. This\r\nchangeableness of weather is a marked characteristic of the greater\r\nportion of the Temperate Zones, especially in winter. The weather maps for\r\nsuccessive days do not, as a rule, show a repetition of the same\r\nconditions over extended regions. In the Torrid Zone it is different. Over\r\nthe greater part of that zone the regularity of the weather conditions is\r\nsuch that, day after day, for weeks and months, the same features are\r\nrepeated. There monotony, here variety, is the dominant characteristic of\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               PART IV.——THE CORRELATIONS OF THE WEATHER\r\n                   ELEMENTS AND WEATHER FORECASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n            CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE\r\n                               PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the series of weather maps in Chapters V-VIII has made it\r\nclear that some fairly definite relation exists between the general flow\r\nof the winds and the distribution of pressure. We now wish to obtain some\r\nmore definite result as to the relation of the direction of the wind and\r\nthe pressure. In doing this it is convenient to refer the wind direction\r\nto the _barometric_ or _pressure gradient_ at the station at which the\r\nobservation is made. The barometric gradient, it will be remembered, is\r\nthe line along which there is the most rapid change of pressure, and lies\r\nat right angles to the isobars (Chapter VII).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\nTake a small piece of tracing paper, about 3 inches square, and draw upon\r\nit a diagram similar to the one here shown. Select the station (between\r\ntwo isobars on any weather map) at which you intend to make your\r\nobservation. Place the center of the tracing paper diagram over the\r\nstation, with the dotted line along the barometric gradient, the minus end\r\nof the line being towards the area of low pressure. Observe into which of\r\nthe four sectors (marked _right_, _left_, _with_, _against_) the wind\r\narrow at the station points. Keep a record of the observation. Repeat the\r\nobservation at least 100 times, using different stations, on the same map\r\nor on different maps. Tabulate your results according to the following\r\nscheme, noting in the first column the date of the map, in the second,\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth columns the number of winds found blowing _with_,\r\nto the _right_ or _left_ of, and _against_, the gradient.\r\n\r\n           TABLE I.——CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND\r\n                           AND THE PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n  +------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |   DATES    |  WITH  |  RIGHT  |  LEFT  | AGAINST |\r\n  +------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |            |        |         |        |         |\r\n  |            |        |         |        |         |\r\n  |            |        |         |        |         |\r\n  |            |        |         |        |         |\r\n  |            |        |         |        |         |\r\n  +------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |   Sums     |        |         |        |         |\r\n  +------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n  |Percentages |        |         |        |         |\r\n  +------------+--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of each column write down the number of cases in that\r\ncolumn, and then determine the percentages which these cases are of the\r\ntotal number of observations. This is done by dividing the number of cases\r\nin each column by the sum-total of all the observations. When you have\r\nobtained the percentage of each kind of wind direction, you have a\r\nnumerical result.\r\n\r\nA graphical presentation of the results may be made by laying off radii\r\ncorresponding in position to those which divide the sectors in Fig. 46,\r\nand whose lengths are proportionate to the percentages of the different\r\nwind directions in the table. Thus, for a percentage of 20, the radii may\r\nbe made 1 inch long, for 40%, 2 inches, etc. When completed, the relative\r\nsizes of the sectors will show the relative frequencies of winds blowing\r\nin the four different directions with reference to the gradient, as is\r\nindicated in Fig. 47.\r\n\r\n=The Deflection of the Wind from the Gradient: Ferrel’s Law.=——The law of\r\nthe deflection of the wind prevailingly to the right of the gradient is\r\nknown as _Ferrel’s Law_, after William Ferrel, a noted American\r\nmeteorologist, who died in 1891. The operation of this law has already\r\nbeen seen in the spiral circulation of the winds around the cyclone and\r\nthe anticyclone, as shown on the maps of our series. In the case of the\r\ncyclone the gradient is directed inward towards the center; in the case\r\nof the anticyclone the gradient is directed outward from the center. In\r\nboth cases the right-handed deflection results in a spiral whirl, inward\r\nin the cyclone, outward in the anticyclone. The operation of this law is\r\nfurther seen in the case of the _Northeast Trade Winds_. These winds blow\r\nfrom about Lat. 30° N. towards the equator, with wonderful regularity,\r\nespecially over the oceans. Instead of following the gradient and blowing\r\nas north winds, these trades turn to the right of the gradient and become\r\n_northeast_ winds, whence their name. From about Lat. 30° N. towards the\r\nNorth Pole there is another great flow of winds over the earth’s surface.\r\nThese winds do not flow due north, as south winds. They turn to the\r\nright, as do the trades, and become southwest or west-southwest winds,\r\nbeing known as the _Prevailing Westerlies_. Ferrel’s Law thus operates in\r\nthe larger case of the general circulation of the earth’s atmosphere, as\r\nwell as in the smaller case of the local winds on our weather maps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n              CORRELATION OF THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND AND\r\n                             THE PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrepare a scale of latitude degrees, as explained in Chapter V. Select\r\nsome station on the weather map at which there is a wind arrow, and at\r\nwhich you wish to study the relation of wind velocity and pressure. Find\r\nthe rate of pressure change per degree as explained in Chapter VII. Note\r\nalso the velocity, in miles per hour, of the wind at the station. Repeat\r\nthe operation 100 or more times, selecting stations in different parts of\r\nthe United States. It is well, however, to include in one investigation\r\neither interior stations alone (_i.e._, more than 100 miles from the\r\ncoast) or coast stations alone, as the wind velocities are often\r\nconsiderably affected by proximity to the ocean. And, if coast stations\r\nare selected, either onshore or offshore winds should alone be included in\r\none exercise. The investigation may, therefore, be carried out so as to\r\nembrace the following different sets of operations:——\r\n\r\n  _A._ Interior stations.\r\n  _B._ Coast stations with onshore winds.\r\n  _C._ Coast stations with offshore winds.\r\n\r\nEnter your results in a table similar to the one here given:——\r\n\r\n         TABLE II.——CORRELATION OF WIND VELOCITY AND BAROMETRIC\r\n                               GRADIENT.\r\n\r\nFor interior (or coast) stations, with onshore (or offshore) winds, in the\r\nUnited States during the month (or months) of\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |Rates of Pressure   |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |Change per Latitude | ∞-20  | 20-10 | 10-5  | 5-     | 3-1/2- | 2-1/2   | etc. |\r\n  |Degree              |       |       |       |  3-1/2 |  2-1/2 |  -2     |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |Distances between   |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |Isobars in Latitude | 0-1/2 | 1/2-1 |  1-2  |  2-3   |  3-4   |   4-5   | etc. |\r\n  |Degrees             |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |                    |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |                    |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |Wind Velocities     |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  | (miles per hour)   |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |                    |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  |                    |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |      Sums          |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |      Cases         |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n  |      Means         |       |       |       |        |        |         |      |\r\n  +--------------------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+---------+------+\r\n\r\nThe wind velocity for each station is to be entered in the column at whose\r\ntop is the rate of pressure change found for that station. Thus, if for\r\nany station the rate of pressure change is 3-1/2 (_i.e._, .03 inch in one\r\nlatitude degree), and the wind velocity at that station is 17 miles an\r\nhour, enter the 17 in the fourth and fifth columns of the table. When you\r\nfind that the rate of pressure change for any station falls into two\r\ncolumns of the table, as, _e.g._, 10, or 5, or 3-1/3, then enter the\r\ncorresponding wind velocity in both those columns.\r\n\r\nIn the space marked _Sums_ write the sum-total of all the wind velocities\r\nin each column. The _Cases_ are the number of separate observations you\r\nhave in each column. The _Means_ denote the average or mean wind\r\nvelocities found in each column, and are obtained by dividing the sums by\r\nthe cases.\r\n\r\nStudy the results of your table carefully. Deduce from your own results a\r\ngeneral rule for wind velocities as related to barometric gradients.\r\n\r\n=The dependence of wind velocities on the pressure gradient= is a fact of\r\ngreat importance in meteorology. The ship captain at sea knows that a\r\nrapid fall of his barometer means a rapid rate of pressure change, and\r\nforetells high winds. He therefore makes his preparations accordingly, by\r\nshortening sail and by making everything fast. The isobaric charts of the\r\nglobe for January and July show that the pressure gradients are stronger\r\n(_i.e_., the rate of pressure change is more rapid) over the Northern\r\nHemisphere in January than in July. This fact would lead us to expect\r\nthat the velocities of the general winds over the Northern Hemisphere\r\nshould be higher in winter than in summer, and so they are. Observations\r\nof the movements of clouds made at Blue Hill Observatory, Hyde Park,\r\nMass., show that the whole atmosphere, up to the highest cloud level,\r\nmoves almost twice as fast in winter as in summer. In the higher\r\nlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, where the barometric gradients are\r\nprevailingly much stronger than in the Northern, the wind velocities are\r\nalso prevailingly higher than they are north of the equator. The\r\nprevailing westerly winds of the Southern Hemisphere, south of latitude\r\nof 30° S., blow with high velocities nearly all the time, especially\r\nduring the winter months (June, July, August). These winds are so strong\r\nfrom the westward that vessels trying to round Cape Horn from the east\r\noften occupy weeks beating against head gales, which continually blow\r\nthem back on their course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n           FORM AND DIMENSIONS OF CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——Provide yourself with a sheet of tracing paper about\r\nhalf as large as the daily weather map. Draw a straight line across the\r\nmiddle of it; mark a dot at the center of the line, the letter _N_ at one\r\nend, and the letter _S_ at the other. Place the tracing paper over a\r\nweather map on which there is a fairly well enclosed center of low\r\npressure (_low_), having the dot at the center of the _low_, and the line\r\nparallel to the nearest meridian, the end marked _N_ being towards the top\r\nof the map. When thus placed, the paper is said to be _oriented_. Trace\r\noff the isobars which are nearest the center. In most cases the 29.80-inch\r\nisobar furnishes a good limit, out to which the isobars may be traced.\r\nContinue this process, using different weather maps, until the lines on\r\nthe tracing paper begin to become too confused for fairly easy seeing.\r\nProbably 15 or 20 separate areas of low pressure may be traced on to the\r\npaper. It is important to have all parts of the cyclonic areas represented\r\non your tracing. If most of the isobars you have traced are on the\r\nsouthern side of cyclones central over the Lakes or lower St. Lawrence, so\r\nthat the isobars on the northern sides are incomplete, select for your\r\nfurther tracings weather maps on which the cyclonic centers are in the\r\ncentral or southern portions of the United States, and therefore have\r\ntheir northern isobars fully drawn.\r\n\r\nWhen your tracing is finished you have a _composite portrait_ of the\r\nisobars around several areas of low pressure. Now study the results\r\ncarefully. Draw a heavy pencil or an ink line on the tracing paper, in\r\nsuch a way as to enclose the average area outlined by the isobars. This\r\naverage area will naturally be of smaller dimensions than the outer\r\nisobars on the tracing paper, and of larger dimensions than the inner\r\nisobars, and its form will follow the general trend indicated by the\r\nmajority of the isobars, without reproducing any exceptional shapes.\r\n\r\nWrite out a careful description of the average _form_, _dimensions_\r\n[measured by a scale of miles or of latitude degrees (70 miles = 1 degree\r\nabout)] and _gradients_ of these areas of low pressure, noting any\r\ntendency to elongate in a particular direction; any portions of the\r\ncomposite where the gradients are especially strong, weak, etc.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——This investigation is carried out in precisely the\r\nsame manner as the preceding one, except that anticyclones (_highs_) are\r\nnow studied instead of cyclones. The isobars may be traced off as far away\r\nfrom the center as the 30.20-inch line in most cases. When, however, the\r\npressure at the center is exceptionally high, it will not be necessary to\r\ntrace off lower isobars than those for 30.30, or 30.40, or sometimes 30.50\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n=Loomis’s Results as to Form and Dimensions of Cyclones and\r\nAnticyclones.=——One of the leading American meteorologists, Loomis, who\r\nwas for many years a professor in Yale University, made an extended study\r\nof the form and dimensions of areas of low and high pressure as they\r\nappear on our daily weather maps. In the cases of areas of low pressure\r\nwhich he examined, the average form of the areas was elliptical, the\r\nlonger diameter being nearly twice as long as the shorter (to be exact\r\nthe ratio was 1.94 : 1). The average direction of the longer diameter he\r\nfound to be about NE. (N. 36° E.), and the length of the longer diameter\r\noften 1600 miles. In the case of areas of high pressure, Loomis also\r\nfound an elliptical form predominating; the longer diameter being about\r\ntwice as long as the shorter (ratio 1.91 : 1), and the direction of trend\r\nabout NE. (N. 44° E.). These characteristics hold, in general, for the\r\ncyclonic and anticyclonic areas of Europe also. The cyclones of the\r\ntropics differ considerably from those of temperate latitudes in being\r\nnearly circular in form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n          CORRELATION OF CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES WITH THEIR\r\n                           WIND CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——Something as to the control of pressure over the\r\ncirculation of the wind has been seen in the preliminary exercises on the\r\ndaily weather maps. We now proceed to investigate this correlation further\r\nby means of the composite portrait method. This method is a device to\r\nbring out more clearly the general systems of the winds by throwing\r\ntogether on to one sheet a large number of wind arrows in their proper\r\nposition with reference to the controlling center of low pressure. In this\r\nway we have many more observations to help us in our investigation than if\r\nwe used only those which are given on one weather map, and the circulation\r\ncan be much more clearly made out.\r\n\r\nProvide yourself with a sheet of tracing paper, prepared as described in\r\nChapter XI. Place the paper over an area of low pressure on some weather\r\nmap, with the dot at the center of the _low_, and having the paper\r\nproperly oriented, as already explained. Trace off all the wind arrows\r\naround the center of low pressure, making the lengths of these arrows\r\nroughly proportionate (by eye) to the velocity of the wind, according to\r\nsome scale previously determined upon. Include on your tracing all the\r\nwind arrows reported at stations whose lines of pressure-decrease converge\r\ntowards the low pressure center. Repeat this operation, using other\r\ncenters of low pressure on other maps, until the number of arrows on the\r\ntracing paper is so great that the composite begins to become confused. Be\r\ncareful always to center and orient your tracing paper properly. Select\r\nthe weather maps from which you take your wind arrows so that the\r\ncomposite shall properly represent winds in all parts of the cyclonic\r\narea.\r\n\r\nDeduce a general rule for the circulation and velocity of the wind in a\r\ncyclonic area, as shown on your tracing, and write it out.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——This exercise is done in precisely the same way as\r\nthe preceding one, except that anticyclones and their winds are studied\r\ninstead of cyclones.\r\n\r\nDeduce a general rule for the circulation and velocity of the wind in an\r\nanticyclonic area, as shown on your tracing, and write it out.\r\n\r\n=The control of the wind circulation by areas of low and high pressure= is\r\none of the most important laws in meteorology. Buys-Ballot, a Dutch\r\nmeteorologist, first called attention to the importance of this law in\r\nEurope, and it has ever since been known by his name. Buys-Ballot’s Law is\r\ngenerally stated as follows: _Stand with your back to the wind, and the\r\nbarometer will be lower on your left hand than on your right._[4] This\r\nstatement, as will be seen, covers both cyclonic and anticyclonic systems.\r\nThe circulations shown on your tracings hold everywhere in the Northern\r\nHemisphere, not only around the areas of low and high pressure seen on the\r\nUnited States weather maps, but around those which are found in Europe and\r\nAsia, and over the oceans as well. Mention has already been made, in the\r\nchapter on isobars (VII), of the occurrence of immense cyclonic and\r\nanticyclonic areas, covering the greater portion of a continent or an\r\nocean, and lasting for months at a time. These great cyclones and\r\nanticyclones have the same systems of winds around them that the smaller\r\nareas, with similar characteristics, have on our weather maps. A further\r\nextension of what has just been learned will show that if in any region\r\nthere comes a change from low pressure to high pressure, or _vice versa_,\r\nthe system of winds in that region will also change. Many such changes of\r\npressures and winds actually occur in different parts of the world, and\r\nare of great importance in controlling the climate. The best-known and the\r\nmost-marked of all these changes occurs in the case of India.\r\nDuring the winter, an anticyclonic area of high pressure is central over\r\nthe continent of Asia. The winds blow out from it on all sides, thus\r\ncausing general northeasterly winds over the greater portion of India.\r\nThese winds are prevailingly dry and clear, and the weather during the\r\ntime they blow is fine. India then has its dry season. As the summer comes\r\non, the pressure over Asia changes, becoming low; a cyclonic area replaces\r\nthe winter anticyclone, and inflowing winds take the place of the\r\noutflowing ones of the winter. The summer winds cross India from a general\r\nsouthwesterly direction, come from over the ocean, and are moist and\r\nrainy. India then has its rainy season. These seasonal winds are known as\r\n_Monsoons_, a name derived from the Arabic and meaning _seasonal_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the Northern Hemisphere.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figure (Fig. 48) is taken from the _Pilot Chart of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Ocean_, published by the Hydrographic Office of the United\r\nStates Navy for the use of seamen. It shows the wind circulation around\r\nthe center of a cyclone which is moving northward along the Atlantic Coast\r\nof the United States. The long arrow indicates the path of movement; the\r\nshorter arrows indicate the directions of the winds. By means of such a\r\ndiagram as this a captain is able to calculate, with a considerable degree\r\nof accuracy, the position of the center of the cyclone, and can often\r\navoid the violent winds near that center by sailing away from it, or by\r\n“lying to,” as it is called, and waiting until the center passes by him at\r\na safe distance. These cyclones which come up the eastern coast of the\r\nUnited States at certain seasons are usually violent, and often do\r\nconsiderable damage to shipping. The Weather Bureau gives all the warning\r\npossible of the coming of these _hurricanes_, as they are called, by\r\ndisplaying _hurricane signals_ along the coast, and by issuing telegraphic\r\nwarnings to newspapers. In this way ship captains, knowing of the approach\r\nof gales dangerous to navigation, may keep their vessels in port until all\r\ndanger is past. Millions of dollars’ worth of property and hundreds of\r\nlives have thus been saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n            CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE\r\n                              TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from even the most general observation of the weather\r\nelements, that the temperature experienced at any place is very largely\r\ndependent upon the direction of the wind. Thus, for instance, in the\r\nUnited States, a wind from some northerly point is likely to bring a lower\r\ntemperature than a southerly wind. To investigate this matter more\r\nclosely, and to discover how the winds at any station during any month are\r\nrelated to the temperatures noted at that station, we proceed as\r\nfollows:——\r\n\r\nSelect the Weather Bureau station at which you wish to study these\r\nconditions. Note the direction of the wind and the temperature at that\r\nstation on the first day of any month. Prepare a table similar to the\r\nfollowing one.\r\n\r\n          TABLE III.——CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND\r\n                          AND THE TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At ..................... during the Month of ........\r\n\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  | WIND         |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  | DIRECTIONS   | N. | NE. | E. | SE. | S. | SW. | W. | NW. |               |\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+               +\r\n  |              |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  +              +----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+               +\r\n  |              |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  +              +----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+               +\r\n  | TEMPERATURES |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  +              +----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+               +\r\n  |              |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  +              +----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+               |\r\n  |              |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |               |\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  | Sums         |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |       | Total |\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  | Cases        |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |       | Total |\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  | Means        |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |       | Mean  |\r\n  +--------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nEnter the temperature at 8 A.M. on the first day of the month in a column\r\nof the table under the proper wind direction. Thus, if the wind is NE.,\r\nand the temperature 42°, enter 42 in the second column of the table.\r\nRepeat the observation for the same station, and for all the other days of\r\nthe month, recording the temperatures in each case in their appropriate\r\ncolumns in the table. Omit all cases in which the wind is _light_, because\r\nwinds of low velocities are apt to be considerably affected by local\r\ninfluences. When the observations for the whole month have been entered in\r\nthe table, add up all the temperatures in each column (_sums_). Find the\r\nmean temperature (_means_) observed with each wind direction by dividing\r\nthe sums by the number of observations in each column (_cases_). Add all\r\nthe sums together; divide by the total number of cases, and the result\r\nwill be the mean temperature[5] for the month at the station. The general\r\neffect of the different wind directions upon the temperature is shown by a\r\ncomparison of the means derived from each column with the mean for the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Derived from the 8 A.M. observations. This does not give the\r\ntrue mean temperature.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\nA graphic representation of the results of this investigation will help to\r\nemphasize the lesson. Draw, as in the accompanying figure (Fig. 49), eight\r\nlines from a central point, each line to represent one of the eight wind\r\ndirections. About the central point describe a circle, the length of whose\r\nradius shall correspond to the mean temperature of the month, measured on\r\nsome convenient scale. Thus, if the mean temperature of the month is 55°\r\nand a scale of half an inch is taken to correspond to 10° of temperature,\r\nthe radius of the circle must be five and a half times half an inch, or\r\n2-3/4 inches. Next lay off on the eight wind lines the mean temperatures\r\ncorresponding to the eight different wind directions, using the same scale\r\n(1/2 in. = 10°) as in the previous case. Join the points thus laid off by a\r\nheavy line, as shown in Fig. 49. The figure, when completed, gives at a\r\nglance a general idea of the control exercised by the winds over the\r\ntemperatures at the station selected. Where the heavy line crosses a wind\r\nline _inside_ the circle it shows that the average temperature\r\naccompanying the corresponding wind direction is below the mean. When the\r\nheavy line crosses any wind line _outside_ the circle, it shows that the\r\naverage temperature accompanying the corresponding wind direction is above\r\nthe mean. Such a figure is known as a _wind rose_.\r\n\r\n=The cold wave and the sirocco= are two winds which exercise marked\r\ncontrols over the temperature at stations in the central and eastern\r\nUnited States. The _cold wave_ has already been described in Chapter V.\r\nIt is a characteristic feature of our winter weather. It blows down from\r\nour Northwestern States or from the Canadian Northwest, on the western\r\nside of a cyclone. It usually causes sudden and marked falls in\r\ntemperature, sometimes amounting to as much as 50° in 24 hours. The\r\n_sirocco_ is a southerly or southwesterly wind. It also blows into a\r\ncyclone, but on its southern or southeastern side. Coming from warmer\r\nlatitudes, and from over warm ocean waters, the sirocco is usually a warm\r\nwind, in marked contrast to the cold wave. In winter, in the Mississippi\r\nValley and on the Atlantic Coast, the sirocco is usually accompanied by\r\nwarm, damp, cloudy, and snowy or rainy weather. The high temperatures\r\naccompanying it (they may be as high as 50° or 60° even in midwinter) are\r\nvery disagreeable. Our warm houses and our winter clothing become\r\noppressive and we long for the bright, crisp, cold weather brought by the\r\n_cold wave_. In summer when a sirocco blows we have our hottest spells.\r\nThen sunstrokes and prostrations by the heat are most common, and our\r\nhighest temperatures are recorded. The word _sirocco_ (from\r\n_Syriacus_=Syrian) was first used as the name of a warm southerly wind in\r\nItaly. The cause and the characteristics of the Italian sirocco and of\r\nthe American sirocco are similar, and the name may therefore be applied\r\nto our wind as well as to the Italian one. In the Southern Hemisphere, at\r\nBuenos Ayres, Argentine Republic, there is a similar contrast between two\r\ndifferent winds. The _pampero_ is similar in many respects to our cold\r\nwave. It is a dry, cool, and refreshing wind, blowing over the vast level\r\nstretches of the Argentine pampas from the southwest. The _norte_ is a\r\nwarm, damp, depressing northerly wind corresponding to our sirocco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n           CORRELATION OF CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES AND THEIR\r\n                             TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——It follows from the two preceding exercises that some\r\nfairly definite distribution of temperature, depending upon the wind\r\ndirection, should exist around areas of low and high pressure. Try to\r\npredict, on the basis of the results obtained in Chapters XII and XIII,\r\nwhat this relation of temperatures and cyclones and anticyclones is. Then\r\nwork out the relation independently of your prediction, by studying actual\r\ncases obtained from the weather maps, as follows:——\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\nPrepare a sheet of tracing paper as shown in Fig. 50. The diameter of the\r\ncircle should be sufficiently large to include within the circle the\r\naverage area covered by a cyclone on the weather maps. Place the tracing\r\npaper, properly divided in accordance with the figure, over a well-defined\r\narea of low pressure on a weather map, centering and orienting it\r\ncarefully. Take the temperature at the station which lies nearest the\r\ncenter of the figure as the standard. Notice the temperatures at all the\r\nother stations which fall within the limits of the circle, and mark down\r\nat the proper places on the tracing paper, the + or - departures of these\r\nlocal temperatures from the standard temperature. Thus, if the standard is\r\n37°, and a station has a temperature of 46°, enter +9° at the proper place\r\non your tracing paper. Again, if a certain station has 24°, enter -13° at\r\nthe proper place on the paper. Continue this process until your paper has\r\nall of its divisions well filled. It is best to select all the maps used\r\nin this investigation from the same month, for in that case the data are\r\nmore comparable than if different months are taken. When a sufficient\r\nnumber of examples has been obtained, find the average departure (+ or -)\r\nof the temperatures in each division of the tracing from the central\r\nstandard temperature. Express these averages graphically by means of a\r\n_wind rose_, as in the last exercise.\r\n\r\n=Another Method.=——The above correlation may be investigated by means of\r\nanother method, as follows:——\r\n\r\nPrepare a piece of tracing paper by drawing an N. and S. line upon it, and\r\nplacing a dot at the center of the line. Lay the paper over an area of low\r\npressure on any weather map, centering and orienting it properly, as in\r\nthe previous exercises. Trace off the isotherms which are near the center\r\nof low pressure. Repeat this process with several maps, selecting\r\ndifferent ones from those used in the first part of this exercise.\r\nFormulate a rule for the observed distribution of temperature, and\r\ndetermine the reasons for this distribution. Note carefully any effects of\r\nthe cyclone upon the temperature gradient.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——The correlation of anticyclones with their\r\ntemperatures is studied in precisely the same way as the preceding\r\ncorrelation. Both methods suggested in the case of cyclones should be used\r\nin the case of anticyclones. When your results have been obtained,\r\nformulate a general rule for the observed distribution of temperature in\r\nanticyclones, and determine the reasons for this distribution.\r\n\r\nFind from your composites the average temperature of cyclones and of\r\nanticyclones, and compare these averages.\r\n\r\n=The unsymmetrical distribution of temperature around cyclones=, which is\r\nmade clear by the foregoing exercises, is very characteristic of these\r\nstorms in our latitudes, and especially in the eastern United States.\r\nThat this has an important effect upon weather changes is evident, and\r\nwill be further noted in the chapter on _Weather Forecasting_. The\r\ncyclones which begin over the oceans near the equator at certain seasons,\r\nand thence travel to higher latitudes,——_tropical cyclones_, so\r\ncalled,——differ markedly from our cyclones in respect to the distribution\r\nof temperature around them. The temperatures on all sides of tropical\r\ncyclones are usually remarkably uniform, the isotherms coinciding fairly\r\nclosely with the isobars. The reason for this is to be found in the\r\nremarkable uniformity of the temperature and humidity conditions over the\r\nsurrounding ocean surface, from which the inflowing winds come. In the\r\ncase of our own cyclones, in the eastern United States, the warm southerly\r\nwind, or sirocco, in front of the center has very different\r\ncharacteristics from those of the cold northwesterly wind, or _cold wave_,\r\nin the rear, as has become evident through the preceding exercise. These\r\nwinds, therefore, naturally show their effects in the distribution of the\r\ntemperatures in different parts of the cyclonic area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n            CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE\r\n                                WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect a file of daily weather maps for some month. Commencing with the\r\nfirst map in the set, observe the weather and the direction of the wind at\r\na considerable number of stations in the same general region (as, _e.g._,\r\nthe Lake region, the lower Mississippi Valley, the Pacific Coast, etc.).\r\nEnter each case in a table, similar to Table IV below, by making a check\r\nin the column under the appropriate wind direction and on a line with the\r\nappropriate type of weather.\r\n\r\n          TABLE IV.——CORRELATION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND\r\n                            AND THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\nAt ________ during the Month of ________.\r\n\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |             | N. | NE. | E. | SE. | S. | SW. | W. | NW. |TOTALS|PERCENTAGES|\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Clear        |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |  D   |     J     |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Fair         |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |  F   |     K     |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Cloudy       |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |  G   |     L     |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Rain and Snow|    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |  H   |     M     |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Totals       |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |  A   |           |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n  |Percentages  | B  |  C  |etc.|     |    |     |    |     |      |           |\r\n  +-------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+------+-----------+\r\n\r\nCount every observation of _rain_ or _snow also as cloudy_, for it usually\r\nrains or snows only when the sky is cloudy. Continue your observations on\r\nall the maps for the month you have chosen. Then count up the whole number\r\nof cases of _clear_ weather you have found with north winds, and write\r\ndown this sum in the first space, in the column reserved for N. winds. Do\r\nthe same with _fair_ and _cloudy_ weather. Add up and enter at the bottom\r\nof the column in the space marked _Totals_ the whole number of\r\nobservations of _clear_, _fair_, and _cloudy_ weather you have observed\r\nwith N. winds. Then find what percentage of the weather with N. winds was\r\n_clear_, and enter this percentage next to the sum of _clear_ weather\r\nobservations, in the first division in the column headed N. Do the same\r\nfor _fair_, _cloudy_, and _rainy_ or _snowy_ weather, deriving the\r\npercentages of rain or snow from the total of _clear_ and _fair_ and\r\n_cloudy_. Repeat this process of summarizing in every column. Your\r\nresults will then show the percentages of the different kinds of weather\r\nnoted with the different wind directions.\r\n\r\nThe lower division of the table and the last two columns on the right are\r\nto be used for a general summary of the whole investigation. By adding\r\ntogether all the totals of _clear_, _fair_, and _cloudy_ weather observed\r\nwith all the eight wind directions you obtain the whole number of\r\nobservations you have made. Enter this in the space marked A, at the right\r\nof the table. From this grand total and the total number of observations\r\nin each column you may find (in percentages) the relative frequencies of\r\nthe different wind directions. These should be entered under the totals at\r\nthe bottom of each column, in the spaces marked _Percentages_ (spaces B,\r\nC, etc.). The total number of observations of _clear_, _fair_, _cloud_,\r\nand _rain_ or _snow_, noted with all the wind directions, are to be\r\nentered in spaces D, F, G, and H, at the right of the table. From these\r\ntotals, and from the grand total in space A, we can determine the relative\r\nfrequency (in percentages) of each kind of weather during the month. These\r\nresults should be entered in spaces J, K, L, and M.\r\n\r\nStudy these results carefully. Formulate them in a brief written\r\nstatement. Express graphically the following:——\r\n\r\n_A._ The percentages of frequency of the different wind directions during\r\nthe month.\r\n\r\n_B._ The percentages of the different kinds of weather noted during the\r\nwhole month for all wind directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\nA wind rose, indicating the percentages of frequency of different winds\r\nduring a month, or a year, or several years, may be constructed as shown\r\nin Fig. 51.\r\n\r\nA certain convenient scale is adopted as representing a frequency of 10%,\r\nand a circle is drawn with this unit as a radius. A second circle, with a\r\nradius twice as long, represents a frequency of 20%, and a third circle,\r\nwith a radius three times as long, represents a frequency of 30%.\r\nAdditional circles may be added if necessary. Distances corresponding to\r\nthe different percentages of frequency of the eight wind directions are\r\nthen laid off along the eight radii of the circles, and the points thus\r\nfixed are joined by a line.\r\n\r\nThe results asked for under question _B_ may be plotted as a weather rose\r\non a diagram similar to that above figured. In this case the percentages\r\nof frequency of the different varieties of weather (_clear_, _fair_,\r\n_cloudy_, _stormy_) may be indicated on the same figure by using different\r\nkinds of lines. Thus, a _solid_ line may be employed to represent _clear_\r\nweather; a _broken_ line for _fair_; a _broken and dotted_ line for\r\n_cloudy_; and a _dotted_ line for _stormy_ weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n            CORRELATION OF CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES AND THE\r\n                                WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——Prepare a piece of tracing paper as shown in Fig. 52,\r\nmaking the diameter of the outer circle about 1000 miles[6] and of the\r\ninner circle 500 miles. Place this diagram over a cyclone on any weather\r\nmap, centering and orienting it carefully. Trace off the weather signs\r\n(indicating _clear_, _fair_, _cloudy_, _rain_ or _snow_) around the\r\ncyclonic center from the map on to the tracing paper, taking only\r\nobservations which are not more than halfway from the cyclonic center to\r\nthe neighboring anticyclonic center. Repeat this process with successive\r\nweather maps until the diagram is well filled in all its different\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Use the scale of miles given on the weather map.]\r\n\r\n_A._ Draw a line on the tracing paper enclosing the average area of\r\n_cloud_ (including _rain and snow_), and a second line enclosing the\r\naverage area of _precipitation_ (_rain_ or _snow_).\r\n\r\n_B._ Determine the percentages of _clear_, _fair_, _cloudy_, and _stormy_\r\nobservations for each division of the tracing paper, _i.e._, (_a_) for the\r\neight sectors of the large circle; (_b_) for the whole of the small\r\ncircle; and (_c_) for the portion of the diagram between the circumference\r\nof the inner circle and the circumference of the outer circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n_C._ Write out in general terms a description of the weather distribution\r\nin cyclones as illustrated by your own investigation.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——This exercise is done in the same way as the\r\npreceding one, except that anticyclones are substituted for cyclones.\r\n\r\n=The association of fair weather with anticyclones and of stormy weather\r\nwith cyclones= is one of the most important lessons learned from a study\r\nof the weather maps. The great areas of high and low pressure control our\r\nweather. On land, where daily weather maps are so easily accessible, a\r\nglance at the map serves in most cases to give a fairly accurate idea of\r\nthe position and extent of cyclones and anticyclones, and hence also of\r\nthe distribution of weather. At sea, on the other hand, the navigator has\r\nno daily weather maps to refer to, and his knowledge of the weather\r\nconditions which he may expect must be gained from his own observations\r\nalone. Of these local observations, the pressure readings are by far the\r\nmost important. A falling barometer usually means the approach of a\r\ncyclone, with wind, or storm, or both. A rising barometer, on the other\r\nhand, is usually an indication of the fine weather associated with an\r\nanticyclone. The unsymmetrical distribution of weather, characteristic of\r\nour cyclones in the United States, and also of most cyclones in the\r\nTemperate Zone, is associated with their unsymmetrical form, and the\r\nunsymmetrical distribution of their temperature already studied. Tropical\r\ncyclones have a wonderfully uniform distribution of weather on all sides\r\nof their centers, just as they have a symmetrical form and an even\r\ntemperature distribution all around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n               PROGRESSION OF CYCLONES AND ANTICYCLONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far no definite study has been made of the changes in the positions of\r\ncyclones and anticyclones. If these areas of stormy and fair weather\r\nalways occupied the same geographic positions, the different portions of\r\nthe country would always have the same kinds of weather. A knowledge of\r\nthe movements of the areas of low and high pressure makes weather\r\nforecasting possible.\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——Select a set of daily weather maps for a month. Turn to\r\nthe first map of the series. Note the position of the center of low\r\npressure, and indicate this position on a blank weather map of the United\r\nStates by marking down a small circle at the proper place. If there are\r\ntwo or more areas of low pressure on the map, indicate the position of\r\neach one of them in a similar way. Turn to the second map of the series,\r\nand again enter on the blank map the position of the center of low\r\npressure. Connect the two positions of each center by a line. This line\r\nmay be called the _track_ of the low pressure center. Continue this\r\nprocess through the whole set of maps, connecting all the new positions\r\nwith the last positions of their respective centers. Mark each position\r\nwith the appropriate date in small, neat figures. When completed your map\r\nwill show at a glance the tracks followed by all the cyclones which\r\ntraveled across the United States during the month you selected. Study\r\nthese tracks carefully. Notice whether there is any prevailing direction\r\nin which the cyclones move, and whether they show any preference for\r\nparticular paths across the country. Can you frame a general rule for the\r\nprevailing direction and path of movement? Are there any cases which do\r\nnot accord with the rule? If so, describe them. In what position, with\r\nreference to the cyclonic tracks during the month you are studying, is the\r\nregion in which you are now living?\r\n\r\nNext determine the _velocities_ with which these cyclones moved. Prepare a\r\nscale of latitude degrees, as described in Chapter V, or of miles, as\r\ngiven at the bottom of the weather map. Measure the distances, in miles,\r\nbetween the successive positions of all the cyclonic centers. Divide these\r\ndistances by 24 in order to obtain the velocity in _miles per hour_. What\r\nis the highest velocity per hour with which any cyclone moved during the\r\nmonth? What is the lowest? What is the mean, or average, velocity?\r\n\r\nStudy the tracks and velocities of cyclones in a similar way during\r\nseveral other months. Compare the positions of the tracks, and the\r\nvelocities of progression, in summer and winter.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——Study the tracks and velocities of anticyclones in\r\nprecisely the same manner. Compare the results derived from your\r\ninvestigations in the two cases.\r\n\r\n=Cyclonic Tracks and the Prevailing Westerly Winds.=——The correspondence\r\nin the direction of movement of most of our cyclones and of the\r\nprevailing westerly winds of the Northern Hemisphere (see Chapter IX)\r\nwill readily be noted. Our weather maps show us the atmospheric\r\nconditions over the United States alone, and we can therefore trace the\r\nprogression of our cyclones over but a limited area of the Northern\r\nHemisphere. An examination of the daily weather maps of the North\r\nAtlantic and North Pacific Oceans, which are based on observations made\r\non board ships, and of the weather maps of other countries, shows us that\r\nthese atmospheric disturbances which appear on our maps may often be\r\ntraced for long distances across oceans and lands, and that they in\r\nreality form a great procession across the northern portion of this\r\nhemisphere, and towards and around the North Pole.\r\n\r\n=The average velocity of cyclones in the United States= was carefully\r\ndetermined by Loomis. His observations show that the mean hourly velocity\r\nof cyclones for the entire year is 28.4 miles, the maximum (34.2 miles)\r\ncoming in February, and the minimum (22.6 miles) in August. Over the North\r\nAtlantic Ocean the hourly velocity is 18 miles; in Europe, 16.7 miles. The\r\ngreater velocity of cyclonic movement in the United States in winter\r\nrecalls what was said at the close of Chapter X concerning the steeper\r\nbarometric gradient and the more rapid movement of the whole atmosphere\r\nover the Northern Hemisphere in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                   SEQUENCE OF LOCAL WEATHER CHANGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next, and last, step in our study of the correlation of the various\r\nweather elements concerns the sequence of weather changes at a station\r\nbefore, during, and after the passage of a cyclone and of an anticyclone.\r\n\r\n_A._ =Cyclones.=——I. Select some station which the weather maps show to\r\nhave been directly on the track of a well-developed cyclone, _i.e._, to\r\nhave been passed over by the center of the cyclone. Note the weather\r\nconditions at this station, before, during, and after the passage of the\r\nstorm. Tabulate your observations according to the following scheme:——\r\n\r\n                                TABLE V.\r\n\r\nWeather Changes at ________________________ during ______________.\r\n\r\n  +-------+----------+---------+-----------+----------+---------+----------------+\r\n  | DATES | PRESSURE | TEMPER- |   WIND    |   WIND   | WEATHER |DIREC.

Select a station which was north of the track of a cyclone, and\r\ntabulate (in a separate table) the weather conditions at that station\r\nbefore, during, and after the passage of the center.\r\n\r\nIII. Do the same for a station which was south of the track of a cyclone.\r\nRepeat these observations for several stations.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Anticyclones.=——Make a similar series of observations for the\r\npassage of an anticyclone centrally over, north and south of, several\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nStudy the sequence of the weather changes shown in the various tables.\r\nDeduce a general rule for these changes and write it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                          WEATHER FORECASTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated at Philadelphia, July 16, 1747, Benjamin Franklin wrote\r\nto his friend Jared Eliot as follows: “We have frequently along the North\r\nAmerican coast storms from the northeast which blow violently sometimes\r\nthree or four days. Of these I have had a very singular opinion for some\r\nyears, viz.: that, though the course of the wind is from northeast to\r\nsouthwest, yet the course of the storm is from southwest to northeast; the\r\nair is in violent motion in Virginia before it moves in Connecticut, and\r\nin Connecticut before it moves at Cape Sable, etc. My reason for this\r\nopinion (if the like have not occurred to you) I will give in my next.”\r\n\r\nIn a second letter to the same correspondent, dated Philadelphia, Feb. 13,\r\n1749-50, Franklin states his reasons as follows: “You desire to know my\r\nthoughts about the northeast storms beginning to leeward. Some years\r\nsince, there was an eclipse of the moon at nine o’clock in the evening,\r\nwhich I intended to observe; but before night a storm blew up at\r\nnortheast, and continued violent all night and all the next day; the sky\r\nthick-clouded, dark, and rainy, so that neither moon nor stars could be\r\nseen. The storm did great damage all along the coast, for we had accounts\r\nof it in the newspapers from Boston, Newport, New York, Maryland, and\r\nVirginia; but what surprised us was to find in the Boston newspapers an\r\naccount of the observation of that eclipse made there; for I thought as\r\nthe storm came from the northeast it must have begun sooner at Boston than\r\nwith us, and consequently have prevented such an observation. I wrote to\r\nmy brother about it, and he informed me that the eclipse was over there an\r\nhour before the storm began. Since which time I have made inquiries from\r\ntime to time of travelers, and observed the accounts in the newspapers\r\nfrom New England, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina; and I\r\nfind it to be a constant fact that northeast storms begin to leeward, and\r\nare often more violent there than to windward” (Sparks’s _Life of\r\nFranklin_, VI, 79, 105, 106).\r\n\r\nThe fact that our northeast storms come from the southwest, which was\r\nfirst noticed by Benjamin Franklin some years before he put the suggestion\r\njust quoted in writing, was one of the great contributions to meteorology\r\nmade by Americans. Modern weather forecasting essentially depends upon the\r\ngeneral eastward movement of cyclones and anticyclones, with their\r\naccompanying weather conditions.\r\n\r\nThe daily weather map shows us the actual condition of the weather all\r\nover the United States at 8 A.M., “Eastern Standard Time.” The positions\r\nof cyclones and of anticyclones; of areas of clear, fair, cloudy or stormy\r\nweather, and of regions of high or low temperatures, are plainly seen at a\r\nglance. These areas of fair and foul weather, with their accompanying\r\nsystems of spiralling winds, move across country in a general easterly\r\ndirection. Knowing something of their direction and rate of movement, we\r\ncan determine, with greater or less accuracy, their probable positions in\r\n12, 24, 36, or 48 hours. The prediction or foretelling of the weather\r\nwhich may be expected to prevail at any station or in any district is\r\n_weather forecasting_.\r\n\r\nWeather forecasts are usually made on our daily weather maps for 24 hours\r\nin advance. It is by no means an easy thing to make accurate weather\r\nforecasts. Careful study and much practice are required of the forecasters\r\nof the Weather Bureau before they are permitted to make the official\r\nforecasts which are printed on the daily maps and in the newspapers.\r\n\r\nA simple extension and application of the principles learned through the\r\npreceding exercises make it possible for us to forecast coming weather\r\nchanges in a general way. These suggestions are, however, not at all to be\r\nconsidered as a complete discussion of this complicated problem.\r\n\r\nWeather forecasts include the probable changes in _temperature_, _wind\r\ndirection_ and _velocity_, and _weather_. Pressure is not included. Begin\r\nyour practice in weather forecasting by considering only the changes that\r\nmay be expected at your own point of observation, and at first confine\r\nyourself to predicting temperature changes alone.\r\n\r\n=Temperature.=——Provide yourself with a blank weather map. Draw an\r\nisotherm east and west across the map, through your station. Draw a few\r\nother isotherms all the way across the map, parallel with the first one,\r\nand so arranged that they will be equal distances apart, the most\r\nnortherly one running through northern Maine and the Northwestern States,\r\nand the most southerly one through southern Florida and Texas. Recalling\r\nwhat you have already discovered concerning the eastward movement of our\r\nweather conditions, what forecast will you make as to the coming\r\ntemperatures at your station? Add some additional east and west isotherms,\r\nso that there will be twice as many on your map as before. What effect\r\nwill this change in the temperature distribution on your map have upon\r\nthe temperature forecast you make for your station? Formulate a general\r\nrule as to temperature forecasts under the conditions of isothermal\r\narrangement here suggested.\r\n\r\nOn a second blank weather map draw an isotherm through your station\r\ninclined from northwest to southeast. Draw a few other isotherms parallel\r\nto the first, and each one representing a temperature 10° higher than that\r\nindicated by the adjacent isotherm on the east. Make a general forecast of\r\nthe temperature conditions that may be expected at your station, as to\r\n_kind of change_, if any; _amount of change_, and _rapidity of change_. Of\r\nthe isotherms just drawn, erase every second one; still, however, letting\r\nthose that are left represent differences of temperature of 10°. What\r\nforecast will you now make as to temperature? How does this forecast\r\ncompare with that just made?\r\n\r\nNow draw twice as many isotherms on your map as you had in the first\r\nplace, still letting these lines represent differences of temperature of\r\n10° in each case. Make a forecast of the kind, amount, and rapidity of\r\ntemperature change at your station under the conditions represented on\r\nthis map. How does this forecast compare with the two just made? Formulate\r\na general rule governing temperature forecasts in cases of isothermal\r\narrangement such as those here considered.\r\n\r\nTake another blank map. Draw through your station an isotherm inclined\r\nfrom northeast to southwest. Draw other isotherms parallel to this, west\r\nof your station, letting each successive isotherm represent a temperature\r\n10° lower than that indicated by the adjacent isotherm on the east. Make a\r\ntemperature forecast for your station under these conditions. Diminish and\r\nincrease the number of isotherms on your map, as suggested in the\r\npreceding example, making temperature forecasts in each case, and\r\ncomparing the three sets of forecasts. Formulate a general rule for\r\ntemperature forecasts made under these systems of isotherms.\r\n\r\nMake temperature forecasts from the daily weather maps for your own\r\nstation, using the knowledge that you have already gained as to the\r\nprogression of cyclones and anticyclones (Chapter XVII), and as to the\r\ntemperature distribution in these areas (Chapter XIV), to help you in this\r\nwork. Study each day’s map carefully before you decide on what you will\r\nsay. Then write out your own forecast, and afterwards compare your\r\nforecast with that made by the Weather Bureau. Note also, by reference to\r\nyour own instrumental observations, whether the succeeding temperature\r\nconditions are such as you predicted.\r\n\r\n=Wind Direction.=——The weather maps already studied taught us that our\r\nwinds habitually move in spirals. The composite picture of the wind\r\ncirculation around cyclones and anticyclones (Chapter XII) further\r\nemphasized this important fact. Evidently this law of the systematic\r\ncirculation of the winds around centers of low and high pressure may be\r\nutilized in making forecasts of wind direction.\r\n\r\nApplying the knowledge already gained concerning cyclonic and anticyclonic\r\nwind circulations, ask yourself what winds a station should have which is\r\nwithin the range of the cyclonic wind system, and is in the following\r\npositions with reference to the center: _northeast_, _north_, _northwest_,\r\n_east_, _at the center_, _west_, _southeast_, _south_, _southwest_. Ask\r\nyourself precisely the same questions with reference to a station within\r\nan anticyclonic wind system. Write out a general rule for the kinds of\r\nwind changes which may be expected to take place under these different\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWhen a station is south of the track of a passing cyclone its winds are\r\nsaid to _veer_, and the change in the direction of its winds is called\r\n_veering_. A station north of the track of a passing cyclone has a change\r\nof direction in its winds which is known as _backing_, the winds\r\nthemselves being said to _back_.\r\n\r\n=Wind Velocity.=——What general relation between wind velocities and areas\r\nof low and high pressure did you discover in your study of the weather\r\nmaps? What was the result of your work on the correlation of the velocity\r\nof the wind and the barometric gradient in Chapter X? And what general\r\nstatement as to the relation between the velocity of the wind and its\r\ndistance from a cyclonic or anticyclonic center may be made as the result\r\nof your work in Chapter XII, on the correlation of cyclones and\r\nanticyclones with their wind circulation? These results must be borne in\r\nmind in making predictions of coming changes in wind velocities. Forecasts\r\nof wind velocities are made in general terms only,——_light_, _moderate_,\r\n_fresh_, _brisk_, _high_, _gale_, _hurricane_,——and are not given in miles\r\nper hour.\r\n\r\nMake forecasts of wind direction and velocity from the daily weather maps\r\nfor your own station. Continue these for a week or two, keeping record of\r\nthe verification or non-verification of each of your forecasts. Then make\r\ndaily forecasts of temperature and of wind direction and velocity\r\ntogether. Write out your own forecast for each day before you compare it\r\nwith the official forecast, and if the two differ, keep note of which one\r\nseemed to you to be the most accurate.\r\n\r\n=Weather.=——What general relation between kind of weather and cyclones and\r\nanticyclones was illustrated on the six maps of our series? What is the\r\naverage distribution of the different kinds of weather around cyclones and\r\nanticyclones, as shown by your composites? (Chapter XVI.) What changes in\r\nweather will ordinarily be experienced at a station as a cyclone\r\napproaches, passes over, and moves off? What conditions will prevail in an\r\nanticyclone?\r\n\r\nMake a series of daily forecasts for your own station of probable weather\r\nchanges, omitting temperature and winds at first. Include in your weather\r\nforecasts the state of the sky (_clear_, _fair_, _cloudy_); the changes in\r\nthe state of the sky (increasing or decreasing cloudiness); the kind of\r\nprecipitation (_rain_ or _snow_) and the amount of precipitation (_light_\r\nor _heavy_). Write out your forecasts; compare them with the official\r\nforecasts, and notice how fully they are verified. Then add temperature\r\nand winds to your forecasts so that you will make a complete prediction of\r\nprobable changes in temperature (kind, amount, and rapidity of change),\r\nwind (direction and velocity), and weather. Practice making these complete\r\nforecasts for several weeks, if time allows. Use all the knowledge that\r\nyou have gained in the preceding work to aid you in this. Study each\r\nweather map very carefully. Do not write down your forecast until you are\r\nsure that you have done the best you can.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\nVary this exercise by extending your forecasts so as to embrace the whole\r\nsection of country in which your station is situated (as, _e.g._, New\r\nEngland, the Gulf States, the Lake region). Pay special attention to\r\nmaking forecasts of cold waves, of heavy rain or snowstorms, of high\r\nwinds over the lakes or along the Atlantic coast, etc. When possible,\r\nobtain from the daily newspapers any particulars as to damage done by\r\nfrost or gales, or concerning snow blockades, floods due to heavy rains,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFig. 53 summarizes what has thus far been learned as to the distribution\r\nof the various weather elements around a well-developed center of low\r\npressure. The curved broken lines represent the _isotherms_ (Chapter XIV).\r\nThe solid concentric oval lines are the _isobars_ (Chapter XI). The arrows\r\nrepresent the _winds_, the lengths of the arrows being roughly\r\nproportionate to the wind velocities (Chapter XII). The whole shaded area\r\nrepresents the region over which the sky is covered by heavy lower clouds.\r\nThe smaller shaded area, within the larger, encloses the district over\r\nwhich rain or snow is falling (Chapter XVI). The lines running out in\r\nfront of the cloudy area represent the light upper clouds (_cirrus_ and\r\n_cirro-stratus_) which usually precede an area of low pressure.\r\n\r\nImagine this whole disturbance moving across the United States in a\r\nnortheasterly direction, and imagine yourself at a station (1) directly in\r\nthe path of the cyclone; (2) south of the track; and (3) north of the\r\ntrack. In the first case, as the disturbance moved on in its path, you\r\nwould successively occupy the positions marked _A_, _B_, and _C_ on the\r\nline _AC_, passing through the center of the cyclone. In the second case\r\nyou would be first at _D_, then at _E_, and then at _F_. In the third case\r\nyou would be at _G_, _H_, and _J_ in succession. What changes of weather\r\nwould you experience in each of these positions as the cyclone passed by\r\nyou? Imagine yourself at some station halfway between the lines _AC_ and\r\n_DF_. What weather changes would you have in that position with reference\r\nto the storm track? In what respects would these weather changes differ\r\nfrom those experienced along the line _DF_? Imagine your station halfway\r\nbetween the lines _AC_ and _GJ_. What weather changes would you have\r\nthere? How would these changes differ from those experienced along the\r\nline _GJ_?\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Fig. 53 is an ideal diagram. It represents\r\nconditions which are not to be expected in every cyclone which appears on\r\nour weather maps. If all cyclones were exactly alike in the weather\r\nconditions around them, weather forecasting would be a very easy task. But\r\ncyclones are not all alike——far from it. Some are well developed, with\r\nstrong gradients, high winds, extended cloud areas, heavy precipitation,\r\nand decided temperature contrasts. Others are but poorly developed, with\r\nweak gradients, light winds, small temperature differences, and it may be\r\nwithout any precipitation whatever. Some cover immense districts of\r\ncountry; others are small and affect only a limited area. It therefore\r\nbecomes necessary to examine the characteristics of each approaching\r\ncyclone, as shown on the daily weather map, very carefully. Notice whether\r\nit is accompanied by heavy rain or snow; whether its winds are violent;\r\nhow far ahead of the center the cloudy area extends; how far behind the\r\nouter cloud limit the rain area begins; what is the position of the cloud\r\nand rain area with reference to the center, and other points of equal\r\nimportance, and govern yourself, in making your forecast, according to the\r\nspecial features of each individual cyclone. Well-developed cyclones will\r\nbe accompanied by marked weather changes. Weak cyclones will have their\r\nweather changes but faintly marked.\r\n\r\nThe distance of your station from the center of the cyclone is of great\r\nimportance in determining what the weather conditions and changes shall\r\nbe, as may easily be seen by examining Fig. 53. If the storm passes far to\r\nthe north or far to the south of your station, you may notice none of its\r\naccompanying weather conditions, except, perhaps, a bank of clouds on your\r\nhorizon. You may for a few hours be under the cloudy sky of some passing\r\nstorm, and yet not be reached by its rainy area. The shifts in the wind\r\nmay be marked and the wind velocities high, or the expected veering or\r\nbacking may hardly be noticeable, owing to the weakness or the distance of\r\nthe controlling cyclone.\r\n\r\nAgain, the rapidity with which weather conditions will change depends upon\r\nthe rate of movement of the cyclone itself. The better developed the\r\ncyclone, the higher its velocity of progression, and the nearer its track\r\nlies to the station, the more emphatic and the more rapid are the weather\r\nchanges it causes. On the other hand, the weaker the cyclone, the slower\r\nits rate of progression, and the further away its track, the less marked\r\nand the slower the weather changes. The probable track of a coming storm,\r\nand its probable rate of movement, therefore, need careful study if our\r\nforecasts are to be reliable.\r\n\r\nThere are many other obstacles in the way which combine to render weather\r\nforecasting extremely difficult. Some of these difficulties you will learn\r\nto overcome more or less successfully by the experience you will gain from\r\na careful and persevering study of the daily weather maps; others, the\r\nbest forecast officials of our Weather Bureau have not yet entirely\r\novercome. The tracks followed by our cyclones vary more or less from month\r\nto month, and even if the average tracks for each month are known,\r\nindividual cyclones may occur which absolutely disregard these tracks.\r\nWhile the average hourly velocity of cyclones is accurately known for the\r\nyear and for each month, the movements of individual storms are often very\r\ncapricious. They may move with a fairly uniform velocity throughout the\r\ntime of their duration; they may suddenly and unexpectedly increase their\r\nrate of movement, or they may as suddenly come nearly to a standstill. The\r\ncharacteristics of cyclones vary in different portions of the country and\r\nat different times. Cyclones which have been accompanied by little\r\nprecipitation on most of their journey are apt to give increased rain or\r\nsnowfall as they near the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of St. Lawrence.\r\nCyclones which over one portion of the country were rainy, may give little\r\nor no precipitation in another portion. Cyclones and anticyclones are\r\nfound to have considerable influence on one another, retarding or\r\naccelerating one another’s advance, or changing one another’s normal path\r\nof progression. While this mutual interaction is clearly seen, and may be\r\nsuccessfully predicted in many cases, many other cases arise in which,\r\nunder apparently similar conditions, the result is very different from the\r\nanticipation. Such are some of the difficulties with which weather\r\nforecasters have to contend, and which prevent the attainment of greater\r\naccuracy in weather prediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PART V.——PROBLEMS IN OBSERVATIONAL\r\n                              METEOROLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                              TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief interest and value of the instrumental work in meteorology are\r\nto be found not only in the taking of the daily observations at stated\r\nhours, but in the working out of numerous simple problems, such as may\r\nreadily be undertaken with the help of the instruments already described.\r\nThus, the temperature of the air (obtained by the sling thermometer,\r\nsupplemented by maximum and minimum thermometers, and by the thermograph\r\nif available) can be determined under a variety of conditions, _e.g._,\r\nclose to the ground, and at different heights above the ground; at\r\ndifferent hours, by day and night; in different seasons; in sunshine and\r\nin shade; during wind and calms; in clear and cloudy weather; in woods and\r\nin the open; over bare ground, grass, snow, or ice; on hills and in\r\nvalleys. Observations may also be made of the temperature of the ground\r\nand of a snow cover, at the surface and at slight depths beneath the\r\nsurface, in different seasons and under different weather conditions.\r\nAmong the problems which may be worked out by means of such observations\r\nas these are the following:——\r\n\r\n_A._ =The Diurnal Range of Temperature under Different Conditions and at\r\nDifferent Heights above the Ground.=——Under the influence of the sun the\r\nregular normal variation of temperature during 24 hours is as follows: A\r\ngradual increase, with the increasing altitude of the sun, from sunrise\r\nuntil shortly after noon, and a gradual decrease, with decreasing altitude\r\nof the sun, from the maximum, shortly after noon, until the minimum, about\r\nsunrise. This variation is known as the _diurnal variation of\r\ntemperature_. Curve _a_ in Fig. 12 illustrates well the normal diurnal\r\nvariation of temperature, as recorded by the thermograph during a period\r\nof clear, warm spring weather (April 27-30, 1889, Nashua, N. H.). The\r\n_diurnal range of temperature_ is the difference between the maximum and\r\nminimum of the diurnal oscillation. The regular normal diurnal variation\r\nin temperature is often much interfered with by other controlling causes\r\nthan the sun, _e.g._, cyclonic winds, clouds, etc.\r\n\r\nI. Study and compare the diurnal ranges of temperature as indicated by the\r\nmaximum and minimum thermometers, or the thermograph, in the instrument\r\nshelter, in clear, fair, cloudy, and stormy weather, during winds and in\r\ncalms, in different months. Summarize your results by grouping them\r\naccording to the general weather conditions, and according to the months\r\nor seasons in which the observations were made. For example, group\r\ntogether and average the ranges observed on clear, calm days in winter; on\r\nsimilar days in early summer or autumn; on clear days with brisk northwest\r\nwinds in winter; on similar days in early summer or autumn; on calm days\r\nwith overcast sky in the different seasons; on stormy days with strong\r\nwinds, etc. Study carefully the weather maps for the days on which your\r\nobservations are made. Pay special attention to the relation between the\r\ndiurnal ranges and the control exercised over these ranges by cyclones and\r\nanticyclones through their winds and general weather conditions.\r\n\r\nII. Observations of diurnal ranges of temperature at different heights\r\nabove the ground may be made by means of maximum and minimum thermometers\r\nfastened (temporarily) outside of the windows of different stories of the\r\nschool or of some other building. These observations should be made out of\r\nwindows facing north, and care should be taken to check, so far as\r\npossible, any draft from within the building out through the window during\r\nthe taking of the observation. If a fire escape is provided on the\r\nbuilding, the instruments may often be conveniently fastened to that.\r\n\r\nStudy the ranges under different conditions of wind and weather at various\r\nheights above the ground, and compare these results with those obtained\r\nunder I. Notice the relations of all your results to the cyclonic and\r\nanticyclonic areas of the weather maps.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal range of temperature in the air over the open ocean from the\r\nequator to latitude 40° has been found to average only 2° to 3°. In\r\nsoutheastern California and the adjacent portion of Arizona the average\r\ndiurnal temperature range in summer is 40° or 45°. Over other arid\r\nregions, such as the Sahara, Arabia, and the interior of Australia, the\r\nrange also often amounts to 40°. Observations of temperature above the\r\nearth’s surface, in the free air, made on mountains, in balloons, and by\r\nmeans of instruments elevated by kites, indicate very clearly that the\r\ndiurnal range of temperature decreases with increasing elevation above\r\nsea level. The results obtained at Blue Hill Observatory, Massachusetts,\r\nby means of kites, show that the diurnal range of temperature almost\r\ndisappears, on the average, at 3300 feet (1000 meters).\r\n\r\n_B._ =Changes of Temperature in the Lower Air, and their Control by the\r\nCondition of the Ground, the Movement of the Air, and Other\r\nFactors.=——Determine the changes of the temperature in the lower air by\r\nmaking frequent readings of the ordinary thermometer in the instrument\r\nshelter, of the sling thermometer, or by an examination of the thermograph\r\nrecord. Group these changes, as in Problem _A_, so far as possible\r\naccording to the weather conditions under which they occurred, and try to\r\nclassify the kinds of change roughly into types. Study the control of\r\nthese various types by the wind and other weather conditions accompanying\r\nthem, as illustrated on the daily weather maps. The control exercised by\r\ndifferent conditions of the earth’s surface may be studied by means of\r\nobservations made with the sling thermometer over different surfaces, such\r\nas grass, bare ground, snow, etc.\r\n\r\nExamples of temperature changes in the lower air, under different\r\nconditions of weather, recorded on the thermograph, are given in Fig. 12,\r\nand are briefly referred to their causes in the text accompanying that\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n_C._ =Vertical Distribution of Temperature in the Atmosphere.=——The\r\nvertical distribution of temperature in the lower air may be studied by\r\nhaving ordinary thermometers or thermographs exposed at different heights\r\nabove the ground, _e.g._, close to the surface; in an instrument shelter;\r\nout of windows on successive stories of some high building; and on the\r\nroof of the building. They may also, in cases where there is a hill in the\r\nneighborhood, be exposed in a valley at the bottom of the hill and at\r\nsuccessive elevations up the side of the hill. It is, however, usually\r\nmuch simpler, as well as more practicable, to take these temperature\r\nreadings by means of the sling thermometer. In the case of observations\r\nmade out of the windows of a building, one observer can take the readings\r\nat different elevations in succession. When the observations are made at\r\ndifferent altitudes on the side of a hill, it is best to have the\r\ncoöperation of several observers, who shall all read their thermometers at\r\nthe same moment of time. The results obtained in the previous problems\r\n(_A_ and _B_) may, of course, also be utilized in studying the vertical\r\ndistribution of temperature in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nStudy the vertical distribution of temperature in the lower air under\r\nvarious conditions of weather and season; at various hours of the day, and\r\nwith varying conditions of surface cover. Make your observations\r\nsystematically, at regular hours, so that the results may be comparable.\r\nGroup together observations made under similar conditions of weather,\r\nseason, time, and surface cover. Determine the average vertical\r\ndistribution of temperature in the different cases. Note especially any\r\nseeming peculiarities or irregularities in this distribution at certain\r\ntimes. Study carefully, as in the previous problems, the relation of the\r\ndifferent types of temperature distribution in the atmosphere to the\r\nweather conditions as shown on the daily weather maps.\r\n\r\nObservations made in different parts of the world, on mountains and in\r\nballoons, have shown that on the average the temperature decreases from\r\nthe earth’s surface upwards at the rate of about 1° in 300 feet of\r\nascent. The rate of vertical decrease of temperature is known in\r\nmeteorology as the _vertical temperature gradient_. When it happens that\r\nthere is for a time an _increase in temperature upwards_ from the earth’s\r\nsurface, the condition is known as an _inversion of temperature_.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the decrease of temperature with increasing altitude above\r\nsea level, the tops of many high mountains even in the Torrid Zone are\r\nalways covered with snow, while no snow can ever fall at their bases,\r\nowing to the high temperatures which prevail there. Balloons sent up\r\nwithout aëronauts, but with self-recording instruments, have given us\r\ntemperatures of -90° at a height of 10 miles above the earth’s surface. On\r\nDec. 4, 1896, Berson reached a height of 30,000 feet and noted a\r\ntemperature of -52°. Inversions of temperature are quite common,\r\nespecially during the clear cold spells of winter. Under such conditions\r\nthe tops and sides of hills and mountains are often much warmer than the\r\nvalley bottoms at their bases. A good example of an inversion of\r\ntemperature occurred in New Hampshire on Dec. 27, 1884. The pressure was\r\nabove the normal, the sky clear and the wind light. The observer on the\r\nsummit of Mt. Washington reported a temperature of +16° on the morning of\r\nthat day, while the thermometers on the neighboring lowlands gave readings\r\nof from -10° to -24°. In Switzerland, the villages and cottages are\r\ngenerally built on the mountain sides and not down in the valley bottoms,\r\nexperience having taught the natives that the greatest cold is found at\r\nthe lower levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                                 WINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe determination of the direction of the wind (by means of the wind vane)\r\nand of its velocity (by means of the anemometer, or by estimating its\r\nstrength) at different hours, under different conditions of weather and in\r\ndifferent seasons, leads to a number of problems. The following simple\r\ninvestigations may readily be undertaken in schools:——\r\n\r\n_A._ =The Diurnal Variation in Wind Velocity in Fair Weather.=——Observe\r\nand record the velocity of the wind (either estimated or registered by the\r\nanemometer) every hour, or as often as possible, on clear or fair days in\r\ndifferent months. Can you discover any regular change in the velocities\r\nduring the day? If so, what is the change? Does the season seem to have\r\nany control over the results obtained? Examine the daily weather maps in\r\nconnection with your observations and determine the effect that different\r\nweather conditions have upon the diurnal variation in wind velocity.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal variation in wind velocity over the open ocean is so slight\r\nas hardly to be noticeable. Over the land, the daytime winds are commonly\r\nstrongest in arid regions. Traveling across the desert often becomes\r\nextremely disagreeable, owing to the clouds of dust which these winds\r\nsweep up from the surface.\r\n\r\n_B._ =The Variations in Direction and Velocity due to Cyclones and\r\nAnticyclones.=——Record the direction and velocity of the wind at your\r\nstation at frequent intervals during the passage of a considerable number\r\nof cyclones and anticyclones. Enter your observations in some form of\r\ntable so that they may be readily examined. (See p. 113.) Note the\r\ncharacter of the changes that occur, classifying them into types, so far\r\nas possible. Study the control of wind directions and velocities by the\r\nspecial features of the individual cyclones and anticyclones as shown on\r\nthe daily weather maps. How are the different types of change in\r\ndirection and velocity affected by the tracks of cyclones and\r\nanticyclones? By their velocity of progression? By the arrangement of\r\nisobars around them? By the height of the barometer at the center? By the\r\nseason in which the cyclones and anticyclones occur?\r\n\r\nFrequent changes in the direction and velocity of our winds are one great\r\ncharacteristic of the Temperate Zones, especially in winter. The\r\ncontinuous procession of cyclones and anticyclones across the United\r\nStates involves continuous shifts of wind. Over much of the earth’s\r\nsurface, however, the regularity and constancy of the winds are the\r\ndistinguishing feature of the climate. Over a considerable part of the\r\nbelts blown over by the northeast and southeast trades, roughly between\r\nlatitude 30° N. and S. and the equator, the winds keep very nearly the\r\nsame direction and the same velocity day after day and month after month.\r\nThus the trades are of great benefit to commerce. Sailing ships may\r\ntravel for days in the trade wind belts without having their sails\r\nshifted at all, with a fair wind all the time carrying them rapidly on to\r\ntheir destination.\r\n\r\n_C._ =The Occurrence and Characteristics of Local Winds, such as Mountain\r\nand Valley and Land and Sea Breezes.=——If the observer happens to be\r\nliving in or near the mouth of a valley or on a mountain side, opportunity\r\nmay be given for the observation of the local winds down the mountain\r\nsides and down the valley at night, and up the valley and the mountain\r\nsides by day, known as mountain and valley breezes. Keep a record of wind\r\ndirection and velocity during the day, and especially during the morning\r\nand evening hours. Notice any marked changes in direction, and the\r\nrelation of these changes to the time of day. Does the velocity of the\r\ndaytime up-cast breeze show any systematic variation during the day? Study\r\nthe relation of mountain and valley breezes to the general weather\r\nconditions shown on the weather maps. How are these breezes affected by\r\nseason? By the presence of a cyclone over the region? Of an anticyclone?\r\nBy the state of the sky?\r\n\r\nIf near the seacoast (_i.e._, within 10 or 15 miles), an interesting study\r\nmay be made of local land and sea breezes. The sea breeze is a wind from\r\nthe ocean onshore, while the land breeze blows offshore. These breezes\r\noccur only in the warmer months. Take frequent observations during the\r\nday, as in the case of mountain and valley winds, noting especially any\r\nchanges in direction and velocity, and the relation of these changes to\r\nthe time of day. Study also the control exercised by the prevailing\r\nweather conditions over the occurrence and the strength of development of\r\nthe land and sea breezes.\r\n\r\nThis problem may be considerably extended by adding temperature\r\nobservations to the simpler record of wind direction and velocity.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Swiss valleys the mountain and valley breezes are such\r\nregular daily weather phenomena that it has become a weather proverb that\r\na failure of the daily change in wind direction indicates a change of\r\nweather. Special names are often given to these breezes where they are\r\nwell marked. In a part of the Tyrol sailing boats go up the lakes by day\r\nwith the valley breeze, and sail back at night with the mountain breeze.\r\nIt is therefore unnecessary for the boats to be rowed either way. Land\r\nand sea breezes, although an unimportant climatic feature in these\r\nnorthern latitudes, are often of the highest importance in the Torrid\r\nZone. The fresh pure sea breeze from over the ocean makes it possible for\r\nEuropeans to live in many tropical climates where otherwise they would\r\nnot keep their health. The land breeze, on the other hand, is apt to be\r\nan unhealthy wind in the tropics, especially when it blows off of swampy\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                       HUMIDITY, DEW, AND FROST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe humidity of the air, as determined by the wet and dry-bulb\r\nthermometers or the sling psychrometer, and the occurrence or absence of\r\ndew or frost, should be studied together. Observations should be made at\r\ndifferent hours, in different kinds of weather, and in different seasons.\r\nFrom such observations the following problems may be solved:——\r\n\r\n_A._ =Diurnal Variation of Relative Humidity under Different\r\nConditions.=——Readings of the wet and dry-bulb thermometers in the\r\ninstrument shelter, or of the sling psychrometer, several times during the\r\nday, will furnish data for determining the diurnal variation of relative\r\nhumidity. Classify your observations according to the weather conditions\r\nunder which they were made, and by months or seasons. Summarize the\r\nresults of your investigation, paying special attention to the relation\r\nbetween the diurnal variation of relative humidity and the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe variations of relative humidity are generally the reverse of those of\r\nabsolute humidity. In the case of the latter the average diurnal\r\nvariations are small. The fluctuations in the relative humidity during\r\nthe day on the northwestern coast of Europe amount to about 7% in\r\nDecember and 17% in August, while in central Asia they average about 25%\r\nin winter and 50% in summer.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Relation of Relative Humidity to the Direction of the\r\nWind.=——Observations by means of the wet and dry-bulb thermometers in the\r\nshelter, or by means of the sling psychrometer, supplemented by records of\r\nwind direction, will furnish data for the solution of this problem.\r\nTabulate your observations according to wind directions and seasons.\r\nDetermine the characteristics of the different winds as to their relative\r\nhumidities. Consider the control of these winds and humidity conditions by\r\ncyclones and anticyclones.\r\n\r\nThe warm wave, or sirocco, in front of our winter cyclones in the eastern\r\nUnited States is a damp, disagreeable, irritating wind. In summer, the\r\nsirocco is usually dry, and during the prevalence of such winds we have\r\nour hottest spells, when sunstrokes are not uncommon. In southern Italy\r\nthe sirocco has the same position with reference to the controlling\r\ncyclone. There the wind is often so dry as seriously to injure\r\nvegetation. The cold wave, on the rear of our winter cyclones, with its\r\nlow temperature and dry air, often comes as a refreshing change after the\r\nenervating warmth of the preceding sirocco. Our feelings of bodily\r\ncomfort or discomfort are thus in a large measure dependent upon the\r\nhumidity and the movement of the air.\r\n\r\n_C._ =The Formation of Dew.=——The formation of dew is to be studied from\r\nthe following points of view, viz., as dependent upon: _a_, the\r\ntemperature and the humidity of the air; _b_, the exposure and condition\r\nof the ground; _c_, the state of the sky; and _d_, the movement of the\r\nair. The occurrence of dew on any night, as well as the amount, whether\r\nlarge or small, can readily be ascertained by inspection. Observe the\r\nconditions of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind direction and\r\nvelocity, as in previous exercises. Pay special attention to the state of\r\nthe sky, the wind movement, and the vertical distribution of temperature\r\nnear the ground. Under heading _b_ (exposure and condition of the ground)\r\nmake observations of the amounts of dew formed on hilltops, hillsides, and\r\nin valleys; on different kinds of surface covering, as grass, leaves,\r\npavements, etc., and over different kinds of soil. Classify the results in\r\naccordance with the conditions under which the observations were made.\r\nCompare the results and draw your conclusions from this study. Practise\r\nmaking predictions of the formation of dew in different places and under\r\ndifferent weather conditions.\r\n\r\nOver the greater portion of the earth’s surface the amount of dew which\r\nis deposited is very small. It has been estimated that in Great Britain\r\nthe total annual amount would measure only an inch and a half in depth;\r\nand in central Europe the depth is given as hardly one inch. In some\r\nparts of the Torrid Zone, on the other hand, dew is deposited in much\r\nlarger quantities. According to Humboldt, the traveler through some of\r\nthe South American forests often finds what seems to be a heavy shower\r\nfalling under the trees, while the sky is perfectly clear overhead. In\r\nthis case dew is formed on the tops of the tree in sufficiently large\r\nquantities to give a shower underneath. It is reported that on the Guinea\r\ncoast of Africa the dew sometimes runs off the roofs of the huts like\r\nrain. In many dry regions the dew is an important agency in keeping the\r\nplants alive.\r\n\r\n_D._ =The Formation of Frost.=——The formation of frost is to be studied in\r\nthe same way as that suggested in the case of dew, _i.e._, as dependent\r\nupon: _a_, the temperature and the humidity of the air; _b_, the exposure\r\nand condition of the ground; _c_, the state of the sky; and _d_, the\r\nmovement of the air. Frosts are usually classified as _light_ or _heavy_.\r\nThe words _killing frost_ are also used. Study the weather and surface\r\nconditions which are most favorable to the formation of frost. Pay special\r\nattention to the relation of frost and inversions of temperature; to the\r\nfrequency of frost on open or sheltered surfaces; on hills or in valleys,\r\nand on the lower and upper branches of trees and shrubs. Determine, as\r\nwell as you can, the weather conditions which precede light or heavy\r\nfrosts, and make predictions of coming frosts, when the conditions warrant\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOur Weather Bureau gives much attention to the prediction of frosts and\r\nto the prompt and widespread distribution of frost warnings. Growing\r\ncrops and fruits are often seriously injured by frosts, and farmers are\r\nnaturally anxious to have as early warning as possible of their\r\noccurrence. Various methods of protecting crops and trees against frost\r\nare used. The method most commonly employed consists in the building of\r\nfires of brush or other inflammable material on the windward side of the\r\nfield or the orchard when a frost is expected. The smoke from the fire is\r\nblown to leeward across the field, and acts as an artificial cloud,\r\naffording protection to the vegetation underneath. Such fires are known\r\nas _smudges_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                     CLOUDS AND UPPER AIR CURRENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttentive observation of clouds will soon lead to a familiarity with their\r\ncommon type forms. A series of cloud views,[7] with accompanying\r\ndescriptive accounts, will teach the names of the clouds and give\r\ndefiniteness to the record. The directions of movement of clouds are\r\ndetermined by means of the nephoscope. Cloud observations should be made\r\nat different hours, in different weather conditions, and in different\r\nseasons. The following problems are concerned with clouds and upper air\r\ncurrents:——\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See _Hydrographic Office Cloud Types_, Appendix B.]\r\n\r\n_A._ =The Typical Cloud Forms and their Changes.=——Note carefully the\r\ncharacteristic forms assumed by clouds; their mode of occurrence, whether\r\nin single clots, or in groups, in lines, or all over the sky; their\r\nchanges in form and in mode of occurrence. Classify and summarize your\r\nresults. Compare the clouds of the warm months with those of the cold\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nObservations have shown that clouds have certain definite characteristic\r\nforms which are substantially the same in all parts of the world. This\r\nfact makes it possible to give names to the different typical forms, and\r\nthese names are used by observers the world over. Hence cloud\r\nobservations, wherever made, are comparable. The first classification of\r\nclouds was proposed by Luke Howard, in 1803. The classification at\r\npresent in use is known as the _International Classification_, and was\r\nadopted by the International Meteorological Congress in 1896.\r\n\r\n_B._ =The Prevailing Direction of Cloud Movements.=——The use of the\r\nnephoscope is necessary in the accurate determination of cloud movements.\r\nStudy the prevailing directions of movement of the clouds, by means of\r\nfrequent observations with the nephoscope, in different weather\r\nconditions. Separate the upper and lower clouds in this study. Summarize\r\nyour results according to the weather conditions and the kinds of clouds.\r\n\r\n_C._ =Correlation of Cloud Form and Movement with Surface Winds, with\r\nCyclones and Anticyclones, and with Weather Changes.=——The results\r\nobtained in the working out of the two preceding problems may be used in\r\nthe present problem. Tabulate your observations of cloud forms with\r\nreference to the wind directions which prevailed at the time of making the\r\nobservations. Do the same with the directions of cloud movement. Determine\r\nthe relation between surface winds and cloud types, and between surface\r\nwinds and the direction of the upper air currents, as shown by the\r\nmovements of the upper clouds. Study the control exercised by cyclones and\r\nanticyclones over cloud forms and over the direction of the upper air\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n_D._ =The Use of Clouds as Weather Prognostics.=——Attentive observation of\r\nthe forms and changes of clouds, and of the accompanying and following\r\nweather changes, will lead to the association of certain clouds with\r\ncertain coming weather conditions. Make your cloud observations carefully,\r\ntaking full notes at the time of observation. Give special attention to\r\nthe weather conditions that follow. Continue this investigation through as\r\nlong a period as possible, until you have gathered a considerable body of\r\nfact to serve as a basis, and then frame a set of simple rules for\r\nforecasting fair or stormy weather on the basis of the forms and changes\r\nof the clouds. Such local observations as these may be employed as a help\r\nin making forecasts from the daily weather maps.\r\n\r\nClouds were used as weather prognostics long before meteorological\r\nobservations and weather maps were thought of. To-day sailors and farmers\r\nstill look to the clouds to give them warning of approaching storms. Many\r\nof our common weather proverbs are based on the use of clouds as weather\r\nprognostics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                             PRECIPITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special study of various problems connected with precipitation\r\ninvolves detailed observations of the amount and rate of precipitation of\r\nvarious kinds, measured by the rain gauge during storms in different\r\nseasons. These observations of precipitation should, of course, be\r\nsupplemented by the usual record of the other weather elements. The\r\nfollowing problems are suggested:——\r\n\r\nA. _The relation of precipitation in general to the other weather\r\nelements, and to cyclones and anticyclones._\r\n\r\nB. _The conditions under which special forms of precipitation (rain, snow,\r\nsleet, hail, frozen rain) occur._\r\n\r\nC. _The conditions associated with light and heavy, brief and prolonged,\r\nlocal and general rainfall._\r\n\r\nThese problems are studied by means of a careful comparison of full\r\nweather records with the daily weather maps during a considerable period\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nRain is the most common form of precipitation the world over, although\r\nsnow falls over large portions of both hemispheres. In the Arctic and\r\nAntarctic zones almost all the precipitation, which is small in amount,\r\ncomes in the form of snow. In southern Europe snow falls at sea level\r\nduring the winter as far south as 36° north latitude on the average. In\r\neastern Asia snow occasionally falls as far south as 23° north latitude.\r\nThe mean annual rainfall varies greatly in different parts of the world.\r\nIn desert regions it is practically nothing. At Cherrapunjee, in India,\r\nit reaches 493 inches, or over 40 feet. A fall of 40.8 inches in a single\r\nday occurred at this station on June 14, 1876. In the United States,\r\nUpper Mattole, Cal., had an extraordinary monthly rainfall of 41.63\r\ninches in January, 1888. An excessive daily rainfall of 8 inches occurred\r\nat Syracuse, N. Y., on June 8, 1876. At Washington, D. C., 2.34 inches\r\nfell in 37 minutes on June 27, 1881. A sudden and very heavy fall of rain\r\noccurred at Palmetto, Nevada, in August, 1890. A rain gauge which was not\r\nexposed to the full intensity of the storm caught 8.80 inches of water in\r\none hour. In August, 1891, an observer at Campo, Cal., measured 11.5\r\ninches as the rainfall in one hour from one very heavy downpour, and from\r\na portion of a second storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                               PRESSURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variations of atmospheric pressure, although insensible to\r\nnon-instrumental observation, are so intimately connected with atmospheric\r\nprocesses that they deserve careful attention. Their observation leads to\r\nseveral problems.\r\n\r\n_A._ =The Decrease of Pressure with Height, as between Valley and Hill, or\r\nbetween the Base and Top of a Building.=——Make these observations with the\r\nmercurial barometer, if possible. Note the air temperatures at the two\r\nlevels at which the barometer readings are made. Determine the heights of\r\nhill or building by means of the following rule: Multiply by 9 the\r\ndifference in barometrical readings at the two stations, given in\r\nhundredths of an inch, and the result will be approximately the difference\r\nin height between the stations in feet. A more accurate result may be\r\nreached by means of the following rule: The difference of level in feet is\r\nequal to the difference of the pressures in inches divided by their sum,\r\nand multiplied by the number 55,761, when the mean of the air temperatures\r\nof the two places is 60°. If the mean temperature is above 60°, the\r\nmultiplier must be increased by 117 for every degree by which the mean\r\nexceeds 60°; if less than 60°, the multiplier must be decreased in the\r\nsame way. For example, if the lower station has a pressure of 30.00\r\ninches and a temperature of 62°, and the upper station has 29.00 inches\r\nand 58° respectively, the difference of level between the two will be\r\n\r\n         (30.00 - 29.00) / (30.00 + 29.00) × 55,761 = 945 feet.\r\n\r\nIf the lower values are 30.15 inches and 65°, while the upper values are\r\n28.67 inches and 59°, then the formula becomes\r\n\r\n (30.15 - 28.67) / (30.15 + 28.67) × [55,761 + (2 × 117)] = 1409 feet.\r\n\r\nThe determination of heights by means of the barometer depends upon the\r\nfact that the rate of decrease of pressure upwards is known. As the\r\nweight of a column of air of a given height varies with the temperature\r\nof the air, it is necessary, in accurate work of this sort, to know the\r\nair temperatures at both the lower and upper stations at the time of\r\nobservation. From these temperatures the mean temperature of the air\r\ncolumn between the two stations may be determined. Tables have been\r\npublished which facilitate the reductions in this work. The heights of\r\nmountains are usually determined, in the first instance, by means of\r\nbarometric observations, carried out by scientific expeditions or by\r\ntravelers that have been able to reach their summits. More accurate\r\nmeasurements are later made, when possible, by means of trigonometrical\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n_B._ =The Diurnal and Cyclonic Variation of Pressure in Different\r\nSeasons.=——This problem is satisfactorily solved only by a study of the\r\ncurves traced by the barograph, or by plotting, as a curve, hourly or\r\nhalf-hourly readings of the mercurial barometer. The _diurnal variation of\r\nthe barometer_ is the name given to a slight double oscillation of\r\npressure, with two maxima and two minima occurring during the 24 hours.\r\nThis oscillation is in some way, not yet understood, connected with the\r\ndiurnal variation in temperature. It is most marked in the tropics and\r\ndiminishes towards the poles. Fig. 15 illustrates, in the May curve, the\r\ndiurnal variation of the barometer at Cambridge, Mass., during a spell of\r\nfair spring weather, May 18-22, 1887. The maxima are marked by + and the\r\nminima by 0. The _cyclonic variation of pressure_ is the name given to\r\nthose irregular changes in pressure which are caused by the passage of\r\ncyclones and anticyclones. The second curve in Fig. 15 shows the cyclonic\r\nvariations in pressure recorded by the barograph at Cambridge, Mass.,\r\nduring a spell of stormy weather, Feb. 23-28, 1887. These curves serve as\r\ngood illustrations of these two kinds of pressure variations.\r\n\r\nStudy your barograph tracings, or your barometer readings, as illustrating\r\ndiurnal or cyclonic variations of pressure. Note the character and the\r\namount of the diurnal and cyclonic variations, and their dependence on\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nOver the greater part of the Torrid Zone the diurnal variation of the\r\nbarometer is remarkably distinct and regular. Humboldt first called\r\nattention to the fact that in those latitudes the time of day may be told\r\nwithin about 15 minutes if the height of the barometer is known.\r\n\r\n_C._ =The Relation of Local Pressure Changes to Cyclones and Anticyclones,\r\nand thus to Weather Changes.=——Make a detailed study of the relation of\r\nthe local pressure changes at your station, as shown by the barograph\r\ncurves, or by frequent readings of the mercurial or aneroid barometers, to\r\nthe passage of cyclones and anticyclones, and to their accompanying\r\nweather changes. Classify the simple types of pressure change, so far as\r\npossible, together with the general weather conditions that usually\r\naccompany these types. Apply the knowledge of local weather changes thus\r\ngained when you make your forecast on the basis of the daily weather\r\nmaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n                         METEOROLOGICAL TABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tables which follow are those which are now in use by the United\r\nStates Weather Bureau. They were first published in the _Instructions for\r\nVoluntary Observers_ issued in 1892, and were reprinted in 1897. The\r\nfollowing instructions will be found of service in the use of the\r\ntables:——\r\n\r\n                          TABLE I.——DEW-POINT.\r\n\r\nThe figures in heavy type, arranged in vertical columns at each side of\r\nthe page, are the _air temperatures_ in degrees Fahrenheit, as recorded by\r\nthe dry-bulb thermometer. The figures in heavy type, running across the\r\npage, denote the _differences_, in degrees and tenths of degrees, _between\r\nthe dry-bulb and wet-bulb readings_, or, technically, the _depression of\r\nthe wet-bulb thermometer_. The figures in the vertical columns denote the\r\n_dew-points_. Make your observation of the wet and dry-bulb thermometers\r\nand note the difference between the two readings. Find, in the vertical\r\ncolumns of heavy type, the temperature corresponding to your dry-bulb\r\nreading, or the nearest temperature to that. Then look along the\r\nhorizontal lines of figures in heavy type for the figure which corresponds\r\nexactly, or most nearly, with the difference between your wet and dry-bulb\r\nreadings. Look down the vertical column under this latter figure until you\r\nreach the horizontal line corresponding to your dry-bulb reading. At this\r\npoint the figures in the vertical column give the dew-point of the air at\r\nthe time of your observation.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Air Temperature (dry bulb), 47°; Wet Bulb, 44°; Difference, 3°.\r\nOn page 148 will be found the table containing both 47° (dry bulb) and 3°\r\n(depression of the dew-point). In the twenty-eighth line of this table and\r\nin the seventh column will be found the dew-point, viz., 41°.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Air Temperature, 61.5°; Wet Bulb, 55.5°; Difference, 6°.\r\n\r\nIn this case 61.5° is not found in the vertical columns of dry-bulb\r\nreadings, but 61° and 62° are found. The dew-point, with a difference\r\nbetween wet and dry-bulb readings of 6°, for an air temperature of 61°, is\r\n50°; for an air temperature of 62°, it is 52°. Evidently, then, for an air\r\ntemperature of 61.5° the dew-point will be 51°, _i.e._, halfway between\r\n50° and 52°. This method of determining dew-points at air temperatures or\r\nwith depressions of the wet-bulb thermometer which are not given exactly\r\nin the tables, is known as _interpolation_.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Air Temperature, 93°; Wet Bulb, 90.5°; Difference, 2.5°. Our\r\ntable gives no dew-points for wet-bulb depressions of 2.5°, with air\r\ntemperature 93°, but we find (on page 152) that for air temperature 93°\r\nand depression of wet bulb of 2°, the dew-point is 91°, while for a\r\nwet-bulb depression of 3°, the dew-point is 89°. By the method of\r\ninterpolation we can readily determine the dew-point in the special case\r\nunder consideration as 90°, _i.e._, halfway between 89° and 91°.\r\n\r\n                     TABLE II.——RELATIVE HUMIDITY.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of this table is the same as that of Table I. The figures\r\nin the vertical columns are the relative humidities (in percentages)\r\ncorresponding to the different readings of the wet and dry-bulb\r\nthermometers.\r\n\r\n               TABLE III.——REDUCTION OF BAROMETER TO 32°.\r\n\r\nThe figures in heavy type, arranged in vertical columns at the left of the\r\npage, refer to the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, as indicated by the\r\nattached thermometer. The figures in heavy type, running across the top\r\nof the page, are the barometer readings in inches and tenths. Make a\r\nreading of the attached thermometer and of the barometer. Find in the\r\nvertical column the temperature corresponding to the reading of the\r\nattached thermometer, and in the horizontal line of heavy figures the\r\nreading corresponding to the height of the barometer. The decimal in the\r\nvertical column, under the appropriate barometer reading, and in the same\r\nhorizontal line with the appropriate thermometer reading, is to be\r\nsubtracted from the height of the barometer as observed, thus correcting\r\nthe reading to freezing. When the attached thermometer reads below 28°,\r\nthe correction is additive.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Attached Thermometer, 69°; Barometer, 30.00 inches; Correction,\r\n-.110; Corrected reading, 29.890 inches.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Attached Thermometer, 73°; Barometer, 29.75 inches; Correction\r\n= ?\r\n\r\nWe do not find any column corresponding to a barometer reading of 29.75\r\ninches. We do find, however, that with a barometer reading of 29.50, and\r\nan attached thermometer reading of 73, the correction is -.118 inch, and\r\nwith a barometer reading of 30.00, the correction is -.120. By\r\ninterpolating, as in the case of the humidity table above, we find the\r\ncorrection for a barometer reading of 29.75 inches, and an attached\r\nthermometer reading of 73°. The correction is -.119, and the corrected\r\nreading is 29.75 - .119 = 29.63 inches.\r\n\r\n            TABLE IV.——REDUCTION OF BAROMETER TO SEA LEVEL.\r\n\r\nThe figures in heavy type, in the left-hand vertical columns, are the\r\nheights, in feet, of the barometer above sea level. The figures in heavy\r\ntype at the top of the columns, running across the page, are the readings\r\nof the ordinary thermometer. The numbers of inches and hundredths of\r\ninches to be subtracted from the barometer reading (corrected for\r\ntemperature by Table III), for the different heights above sea level, are\r\ngiven in the vertical columns.\r\n\r\nThe altitude above sea level of the city or town at which the observation\r\nis made should be ascertained as accurately as possible from some\r\nrecognized authority, as, _e.g._, from a railroad survey; from Government\r\nmeasurements, or from some engineer’s office. The correction to be made is\r\ndetermined by a simple inspection of the table or by the method of\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Altitude of Barometer above sea level, 840 feet; Temperature of\r\nthe air, 40°; Correction, +.931 inch.\r\n\r\n_Example_: Altitude of Barometer above sea level, 205 feet; Temperature of\r\nthe air, 45°; Correction = ?\r\n\r\nHere 205 feet and 45° are neither of them found in the table. Hence a\r\ndouble interpolation is necessary. For 200 feet and 40° the correction is\r\n+.224 inch. For 200 feet and 50° the correction is +.220 inch. Hence for\r\n200 feet and 45° the correction is +.222 inch. For 210 feet and 40° the\r\ncorrection is +.235 inch. For 210 feet and 50° the correction is +.231\r\ninch. Hence for 210 feet and 45° the correction is +.233 inch. Now for 205\r\nfeet we should have a correction midway between +.235 inch and +.233 inch\r\nor +.234 inch.\r\n\r\n     TABLE I.——TEMPERATURE OF THE DEW-POINT, IN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.\r\n\r\n

                   APPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n                        SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this book to lead the student to the independent\r\ndiscovery of the most important facts in our ordinary weather conditions,\r\nand of the interrelations of the different weather elements. This\r\npractical study having taught something as to the real nature of\r\natmospheric phenomena by actual observation, rapid and substantial\r\nprogress may be made in the knowledge of the distribution and of the\r\nexplanation of similar phenomena in other parts of the world, as derived\r\nthrough a study of the text-books. By means of this combination of the two\r\nkinds of study, the inductive and the didactic, the advantages of both may\r\nbe preserved, and the slow progress of the first method and the unsound\r\nprogress of the second may be avoided. This book is not a text-book, and\r\nit therefore does not attempt to give explanations of various phenomena\r\ndiscovered by the class. Explanations will, of course, be called for by\r\nthe scholars, in increasing number as the work progresses, and the larger\r\nrelations of the study become apparent. It is best, if possible, to leave\r\nthe more complicated matters (such as the cause of the deflection of the\r\nwind from the gradient, of cyclones and anticyclones, etc.) until the\r\nsubjects can be taken up in detail and fully explained, for instance in\r\nthe later years of the high school course. It is not advisable to raise\r\nsuch complicated questions in the grammar school work if they can be\r\navoided. The teacher who has a fairly good knowledge of one comprehensive\r\nmodern text-book of meteorology, such as Davis’s _Elementary Meteorology_,\r\nwill find himself sufficiently well equipped to answer the questions put\r\nby the class.\r\n\r\nThe value of the work outlined in this little book can be much increased\r\nif the larger applications of the lessons here learned are strongly\r\nemphasized. Suggestions along this line have been made in fine print\r\nthroughout the text, but the examples given may be further extended to the\r\ngreat advantage of the student. Careful attention ought to be given to the\r\nformulating and writing out of the generalizations reached by the class,\r\nfor in these written summaries the results are preserved in compact form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe work outlined in this chapter is adapted to the lower grades in the\r\ngrammar school. It is assumed that the pupils have already had some\r\npreliminary training in the simplest non-instrumental weather\r\nobservations, such as can readily be made during the primary school years.\r\nFor the convenience of teachers who may desire it, a brief outline of work\r\nsuited to the primary school grades is here given. It is desirable that\r\neven older scholars be given some such training as this before they take\r\nup the exercises of Chapter II.\r\n\r\nThe central idea in this elementary work is to train the children in\r\nintelligent weather observation, so that they may come to appreciate what\r\nour typical weather changes are; that they may recognize the types as they\r\nrecur, and may see how each example differs from, or accords with, those\r\nthat have preceded it. We are all so directly affected by the weather\r\nconditions prevailing at any time that even the youngest children are\r\nforced, unconsciously to be sure, to take some notice of these changes.\r\nThe work of the teacher is, therefore, simply to direct attention to what\r\nis already seen.\r\n\r\nWhen the children come to school on some snowy winter day, with a\r\nnortheast wind, chilling and damp, attention may be called to the need of\r\novershoes and overcoats, to the piling up of the snow in deep drifts at\r\ncertain places near the school or in the town, while in other places the\r\nground is left bare; to the ease with which snowballs may be made, and to\r\nother facts which will very readily suggest themselves. A day or two after\r\nsuch a storm, when the sun is shining bright in a cloudless sky, when\r\nthere is no wind and the air is dry, cold, and crisp, the contrasts\r\nbetween these two weather types should be brought out. Instead of snow we\r\nnow have sunshine: instead of a damp, chilling northeaster we now have a\r\ncalm and the air is dry; snowballs cannot easily be made in the early\r\nmorning because the snow is frozen hard and is too dry, but towards noon,\r\nif the temperature rise high enough, there may be thawing on the tops or\r\nsides of the snowdrifts, and there the snow becomes soft enough for\r\nsnowballing. Another weather type, often noted during our winter in the\r\ncentral and eastern United States, and strongly contrasted with both of\r\nthe preceding conditions, is that which brings us a warm, damp, southerly\r\nwind, frequently accompanied by heavy rains. As these damp winds blow over\r\nsnow-covered surfaces they become foggy and the ground is said to “smoke”;\r\nthe heavy rain rapidly melts the snow; slush and mud make bad walking;\r\nrivers and brooks rise rapidly, perhaps overflowing their banks; low-lying\r\nplaces become filled with standing water. These and other features should\r\nall be brought out by the teacher, not by telling the class of them\r\ndirectly, but by judicious questioning, and they should be contrasted with\r\nthe conditions which may immediately follow, when the storm has cleared\r\noff, and when the low temperatures brought by a cold wave, with its dry\r\nnorthwest wind, have resulted in freezing lakes, rivers, and brooks, and\r\nwhen skating and sliding may be indulged in. Early summer weather\r\nconditions, with their characteristic warm spells, cumulus clouds,\r\nthunderstorms, and (near the coast) sea breezes, furnish another long list\r\nof typical changes that should be just as carefully noted and described as\r\nthe more striking winter characteristics. Autumn types add further to the\r\nlist, which might be extended almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nOne whole year of the grammar school course may well be given to the\r\nobservations suggested in Chapter I, provided that there is no need of\r\nhastening on to the more advanced work. The advantage of extending the\r\ncourse over a whole school year is great, because such extension gives\r\nopportunity for becoming familiar with late summer, autumn, winter,\r\nspring, and early summer weather types, and this is far better than\r\nattempting to crowd all the work into one short season. The interest of a\r\nclass can easily be kept up throughout a school year by means of a\r\nprogressive system of observations. It is best to vary the observations\r\nfrom time to time, and to arrange them so that, beginning with the more\r\nsimple, they shall gradually become more complete and more advanced as\r\nthe year goes on. Thus, starting with temperature observations alone,\r\nthese may be continued for one or two weeks before they are supplemented\r\nby records of wind direction and velocity. After some practice in the\r\nobservation of these two weather elements (say during one month), data as\r\nto the state of the sky may be added. Cloud observations themselves may\r\nwell be graded during successive weeks, so that, beginning with the\r\nsimplest notes concerning amounts of cloudiness, the pupils shall\r\ngradually advance to the point of observing, and perhaps even of\r\nsketching, the common cloud forms and their changes. Thus an important\r\nstep will have been taken towards appreciating the need of a standard\r\ncloud classification, which may be given later.\r\n\r\nThe addition of records of precipitation completes the list of simple\r\nnon-instrumental weather observations, and these records, as well as the\r\ncloud records, can easily be graded, so that, during successive weeks,\r\nevery week’s work shall be different from that of every other week. In\r\nthis progression from the simpler to the more complicated observations\r\nlies the secret of making the work attractive. Nothing will sooner check\r\ninterest in the study than the necessity of making exactly the same\r\nobservations day after day and week after week throughout the year. A\r\ngraded course of non-instrumental observation, such as is suggested, gives\r\na very practical general knowledge of our common weather types and\r\nchanges, and of the relations of one weather element to another. The\r\nquestions asked under the different headings in this chapter are designed\r\nto awaken the interest of the scholars, and to call their attention to the\r\nmore important points of diurnal, cyclonic, and seasonal changes in\r\nweather elements. The teacher will readily think of other questions which\r\nmay be suggested for the consideration of the class.\r\n\r\nAlthough the non-instrumental records are of little value for future\r\nreference, as compared with the instrumental observations, they should\r\nnevertheless be systematically preserved by the class in their record\r\nbooks. After discussion of the daily observations made by the different\r\nscholars, or by one of their number, the records may be written upon one\r\nof the blackboards reserved for this purpose. At the close of the day, or\r\nthe next morning, the blackboard notes should be entered in a record book\r\nkept in the schoolroom. The teacher may guide in the discussion of the\r\nobservations; may suggest points overlooked by the scholars; may draw\r\ncomparisons between the weather conditions of other weeks and of other\r\ndays. This talking over of the observations is most important, as it never\r\nfails to bring out much of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThis work may usually be begun in the early years of the grammar school\r\ncourse, as soon as the non-instrumental observations have been\r\nsatisfactorily completed. The scheme of progressive observations already\r\nsuggested may be followed to advantage in the instrumental work as well as\r\nin the non-instrumental. It is often a good plan to have a different\r\nscholar assigned to the task of taking the observations every day, or it\r\nmay be more advisable to divide the work, making one responsible for the\r\ntemperature observations, another for the precipitation, etc. It is well\r\nto have the daily instrumental weather records written upon the\r\nblackboard in the schoolroom, as already suggested in the case of the\r\nnon-instrumental observations. At the end of each day the blackboard data\r\nshould be entered in a permanent record book by some one of the scholars,\r\nand some ingenuity can be exercised in devising the best scheme for\r\nkeeping this record. The record book should be carefully preserved in the\r\nschoolroom, where it may be referred to by the scholars of future years\r\nwhen any unusually severe storm, or a spell of excessively hot or dry\r\nweather, or a remarkable cold wave occurs, in order that comparison with\r\npast occurrences of a similar kind may be made. It is well to have the\r\nrecord book of large size, and to have each day’s record entered across\r\ntwo full pages. On the left-hand page the temperature, pressure, rainfall,\r\nwind direction and velocity, etc., may be entered, each observation in its\r\nproper column, the number of columns being increased according to the\r\nincreasing number of observations. The right-hand page may be left for\r\n“Remarks.” These “Remarks” should include notes of any meteorological\r\nphenomena which did not find a place in the columns reserved for the\r\nregular observations, _e.g._, occurrence of hail, or frozen rain; damage\r\nby lightning, winds, or floods; freezing up of rivers or brooks;\r\ninterruption of railroad or street-car traffic by snow, etc., and, in\r\ngeneral, explanatory comments on the weather conditions. Instructive\r\nlessons may be taught as to the relation of the local weather conditions\r\nwhich prevail in the vicinity of the school, and those of other portions\r\nof the country, by comments on newspaper despatches concerning gales along\r\nthe coast or on the lakes, and resulting damage to shipping; of snow\r\nblockades and stalled trains; of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes; of\r\nhot waves and sunstrokes, or of cold waves and the destruction of crops or\r\nfruits by the frost. The scholars should be encouraged to bring into the\r\nclass any comments on such phenomena as may be of interest in the work.\r\nSuch of these newspaper clippings as are of the most value may be pasted\r\nin the space reserved for the “Remarks,” where they may be referred to by\r\nsucceeding classes; and in this space also may be pasted at the end of\r\neach week the barograph and thermograph sheets, if these instruments are\r\nin use at the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThese observations may usually be profitably undertaken in the later\r\ngrammar and in the high school years. The instruments described, while all\r\ndesirable, are by no means all necessary, and no teacher should postpone\r\nthe establishment of a course in observational meteorology for the reason\r\nthat a complete set of first-class instruments cannot be secured at the\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nIf the school is provided with a psychrometer, there will be no need of\r\nthe ordinary thermometer, because the psychrometer gives the true air\r\ntemperature. It is well, however, to have both stationary wet and dry-bulb\r\nthermometers, in the shelter, for ordinary school use, and also a sling\r\npsychrometer for use in the meteorological _field work_ which forms an\r\nimportant part of the more advanced instrumental work in meteorology. The\r\nsling psychrometer may, of course, be used simply as an ordinary sling\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\nThe simple form of mercurial barometer, without vernier and without\r\nattached thermometer, described in Chapter II, will be found the best\r\nbarometer for general school use. The standard barometer, described in\r\nthis chapter, is too expensive and too complicated to come into extended\r\nuse in our schools. Full instructions concerning the care, the reading,\r\nand the corrections of the standard mercurial barometer are published by\r\nthe Weather Bureau, and to these instructions teachers who have such an\r\ninstrument are referred. (See Appendix B.)\r\n\r\nThe form of table given at the end of this chapter is intended merely as a\r\nsuggestion, and not as a rigid scheme to be adopted in every school. In\r\nusing the instruments here described, practice with the maximum and\r\nminimum thermometers (in addition to the simpler work of Chapter II) may\r\nbe given before any attempt is made to have the class use the\r\npsychrometer. And in using the psychrometer one week may well be given to\r\nthe determination of the dew-point alone, before the wet and dry-bulb\r\nreadings are employed to determine the relative humidity. Absolute\r\nhumidity, which is not referred to in this chapter, may, if the teacher\r\ndeem it advisable, be added as another weather element for study. A\r\nrefinement in the notes on the state of the sky is suggested, viz., that\r\ncloudiness should be recorded in tenths of the sky covered by clouds. This\r\nis an advance over the earlier, less accurate cloud observations, and is\r\nin line with such a progressive scheme as has been recommended. This book\r\nis not intended to present a rigid scheme of observational work in\r\nmeteorology, alike for all schools, but rather to make suggestions for the\r\nguidance of teachers in laying out such a course as may fit their own\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading _Summary of Observations_ only a few of the most\r\nimportant climatic elements have been noted. The list may easily be\r\nextended by the addition of such data as the following: For temperature,\r\nmean diurnal range; mean diurnal variability (the mean of the differences\r\nbetween the successive daily means). For humidity, monthly mean absolute\r\nhumidity. For precipitation, the maximum daily precipitation; the number\r\nof rainy and snowy days in every month, the number of clear, fair, and\r\ncloudy days in every month; the mean frequency of rainfall in every month\r\n(number of rainy days divided by the total number of days); the number of\r\ndays with thunderstorms, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the monthly summaries should be discussed in the\r\nclass, and that the scholars should give verbal statements as to the\r\nnumerical results which they have obtained. In this way the work will have\r\na living interest, which the mere compilation of summaries does not\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nThe first thing for any teacher to do who intends to establish a course in\r\nmeteorology is to secure a supply of daily weather maps. Arrangements\r\nshould be made to have them mailed regularly from the nearest\r\nmap-publishing station of the Bureau. It is important that the Saturday\r\nmorning map, which is usually not sent to schools, should be included in\r\nthe set, as the break of two days (Saturday and Sunday) in every week\r\nseriously interferes with the value of the work that may be done on\r\nconsecutive maps. The maps should be securely fastened up in the\r\nschoolroom or in the hall. It is advisable to keep at least two maps thus\r\non view all the time, in order that the scholars may be able to study the\r\nchanges from day to day by comparing the last two or three maps with one\r\nanother. As soon as they are removed from the wall, the maps should be\r\ncarefully filed away for future reference. They may be conveniently kept\r\nin stiff brown paper folders, each month’s maps being enclosed in a\r\nseparate folder, with the name of the month and the year written on the\r\noutside. It is a good plan to keep with the file of maps any newspaper\r\nclippings referring to notable meteorological phenomena associated with\r\nthe conditions shown on the maps. Thus, newspaper accounts of the damage\r\ndone by a hurricane along the Atlantic Coast; of the blockades caused by a\r\nheavy snowstorm in the Northwest; of tornadoes in the Mississippi Valley;\r\nof hot waves and sunstrokes in our larger cities, will serve to enliven\r\nthe study of the maps, and will also help, in later references to them, to\r\nrecall interesting points that might otherwise escape the memory. It is\r\ntrue that newspapers are prone to exaggerate, and that they are lamentably\r\ninaccurate in their use of meteorological terms; but nevertheless they\r\nmay often be profitably used in such general studies as these. Besides the\r\ncomplete weather map, the school will need a supply of blank weather maps,\r\nas used by the Weather Bureau. These may usually be secured from the\r\nnearest map-publishing station at cost price. In the case of the\r\npreparation of illustrations for permanent class use, as suggested later,\r\nit is advisable to employ the blank maps used as the base of the\r\nWashington daily weather maps, and to be obtained, at cost price, on\r\napplication to the Chief of the Weather Bureau, Washington, D. C. These\r\nare larger in size (16-1/2 by 23-3/4 inches) than the station maps, and\r\nthe paper is of a better quality. Colored illustrations with these\r\nWashington blank maps as the base furnish an economical, simple, and\r\neffective means of teaching elementary meteorology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter a series of six consecutive weather maps is taken as the\r\nbasis of the work. The study of the weather elements on such a series of\r\nmaps gives a far clearer understanding of the distribution of these\r\nelements and of their relation one with another, than if a far larger\r\nnumber of single maps are studied which do not follow one another in\r\nregular sequence. Teachers should add to the map-drawing exercises by\r\ngiving their classes the data from other sets of maps selected from the\r\nschool files. Summer maps as well as winter ones should be used, in order\r\nthat too much emphasis may not be laid on winter conditions. The search\r\nfor the various cities in which Weather Bureau stations are established,\r\ninvolved in the work of entering the data on the blank maps, furnishes\r\nexcellent practice in geography. This exercise may be varied, and practice\r\nin the location of the different States may be given, if the teacher reads\r\nout to the class the temperatures in different parts of the various\r\nStates, as, _e.g._, central Arizona, 34°; southwestern Tennessee, 30°;\r\nnorthern Nevada, 38°, etc. As the State names are not given on the Weather\r\nBureau maps, such a method as this will give a very desirable familiarity\r\nwith the relative positions of the States of the Union. If the school\r\npossesses a blackboard outline map of the United States, it may be a good\r\nplan, if the class is small, to have one of the pupils enter the\r\ntemperatures and draw the isotherms on the board before the class, and to\r\nlet the others correct him if they see that he is going wrong. As to\r\nirregularities in the isotherms, which may cause trouble, the officials of\r\nthe Weather Bureau vary somewhat among themselves in dealing with such\r\ncases, and no definite rules can be laid down to fit all occasions. It is\r\nbest to select maps with few irregularities at first, and in time\r\nexperience will show how the exceptional cases may be treated.\r\n\r\nBy the scheme of coloring isothermal maps, suggested in this chapter, a\r\nvaluable series of permanent illustrations of noteworthy weather types for\r\nclass use can readily be prepared at very slight cost. For the purposes of\r\nthese colored illustrations it is best to use the large scale Washington\r\nblank weather maps, as suggested in the preceding chapter, and to have\r\neach map mounted on heavy cardboard after it has been colored. By means of\r\nthis mounting the maps are prevented from tearing, and can be kept smooth\r\nand in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of coloring may be varied to suit the fancy of the scholars,\r\nfor the preparation of these permanent illustrations may well be intrusted\r\nto those of the class who are especially interested in the work, and who\r\nare skillful in their use of the paint brush. The work is really very\r\nsimple and needs only ordinary care. As soon as the drawing of isotherms\r\nand the coloring of isothermal charts have been sufficiently studied, the\r\nteacher should hang up the daily weather map each day (or a blank map with\r\nthe isotherms for the day drawn on it), and should call attention to the\r\ntemperature changes from day to day. In this way the facts of actual\r\ntemperature changes experienced by the class will be associated with the\r\nlarger temperature changes shown on the weather maps.\r\n\r\nThe sections on temperature gradients may be postponed, if the teacher\r\ndeems it advisable, until other matters of a simpler nature are passed.\r\nThe idea of rates of change is not an easy one for students to grasp, and\r\nit is far better to postpone the consideration of this subject than to\r\ninvolve the class in any confusion at this stage. It is a mistake,\r\nhowever, to omit these sections altogether, as a clear conception of the\r\nprinciple of rates is a valuable part of a student’s mental equipment. It\r\nis a good plan, in the exercises on lines of temperature decrease, to\r\nhave maps prepared with _faint_ isotherms and _heavy_ lines of temperature\r\ndecrease, in order to emphasize the idea of change of temperature, in\r\ncontrast to the idea of constancy of temperature expressed by the\r\nisotherms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nIn the work on the wind charts it is essential to proceed very slowly, in\r\norder that the best results may be obtained by the pupils. Some of the\r\naberrant wind courses, which complicate the discovery of the cyclonic and\r\nanticyclonic spirals, may well be omitted in the case of the younger\r\nclasses, and considerable assistance in facilitating these discoveries may\r\nbe given by suggestions as to adding intermediate dotted wind arrows, in\r\nsympathy with the observed wind directions. The anticyclonic systems are\r\nalways much more difficult to discover than the cyclonic, and care should\r\nbe taken to assist the class in this matter as much as seems necessary.\r\n\r\nThe questions in the text are merely suggestive, and are by no means as\r\nnumerous as it would be well to make them in the class. The discovery of\r\nthe spirals will probably be made by degrees. The concise formulation of\r\nthe facts discovered will furnish excellent basis for exercises in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the discussion as to whether the winds blow\r\ncircularly around, or radially in towards, centers of low pressure, which\r\nusually comes up in every class in meteorology at some stage in the study,\r\nwas carried on in a very animated way about the middle of the present\r\ncentury in this country. Two noted American meteorologists, Redfield and\r\nEspy, and their respective followers, took opposite sides in this\r\ncontroversy, Redfield maintaining at the start that the winds moved in\r\ncircles, and Espy maintaining that they followed radial courses. The truth\r\nlay between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe study of atmospheric pressure is not easy, because the pupils cannot\r\nperceive the changes in pressure from day to day by their unaided senses.\r\nEspecially difficult does this study become if the class has not already\r\nhad some practice in making barometer readings. When this observational\r\nwork has not preceded the consideration of the isobaric lines of the daily\r\nweather maps, the teacher should introduce the subject of pressure very\r\ncarefully. The experiment with the Torricellian tube will show the class\r\nsomething of the reality of atmospheric pressure, and the variations in\r\nthis pressure from day to day can readily be made apparent by means of a\r\nfew barometer readings, if time cannot be spared for a regular and\r\ncontinued series of barometer observations. A word may be said as to the\r\ncorrection of barometric readings for local influences, in order to make\r\nthese readings comparable, if this matter has not been previously met\r\nwith, but care should be taken not to confuse the younger pupils too much\r\nwith explanations at this stage of the work. It may be well to omit this\r\npoint unless it is brought up by some pupil. The questions asked in the\r\ntext are merely suggestive. They may be added to and varied at the\r\ndiscretion of the teacher.\r\n\r\nLines of pressure-decrease should be drawn on all isobaric charts studied\r\nin the class, as they are highly instructive. When the isobars are near\r\ntogether, these lines of pressure-decrease may be drawn heavier, to\r\nindicate a steeper gradient. The convergence of these lines towards\r\nregions of low pressure, and their divergence from regions of high\r\npressure, seen on every map on which these gradients are drawn, emphasizes\r\nan important lesson. Before measuring rates of pressure-decrease by means\r\nof a scale, considerable practice should be given in the study, by means\r\nof the eye, of the rapidity or slowness of decrease of pressure, as shown\r\nby the heavier or lighter lines of pressure-decrease. When the broad facts\r\nof differing rates are comprehended, then the actual measurement of these\r\nrates is a comparatively easy matter. In any case, however, an\r\nappreciation of these rates of change is not always readily gained, even\r\nby older scholars in the high school. It is, therefore, of prime\r\nimportance to proceed very slowly indeed at this point, and to have every\r\nstep fully understood before another step is taken.\r\n\r\nThe instructions in the text for measuring rates of pressure-decrease are,\r\nthat these rates shall be recorded as so many hundredths of an inch of\r\nchange of pressure in one latitude-degree. This is done for the sake of\r\nsimplicity. If this rate is expressed in hundredths of an inch of pressure\r\nin a quarter of a latitude-degree of distance, the numerical value is the\r\nsame as if expressed in millimeters of pressure per latitude-degree of\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the prevalence of different kinds of weather over the country\r\nat the same time is of great importance. It should be strongly emphasized\r\nby the teacher in the course of the discussion of the maps of weather\r\ndistribution. Additional exercises of the same sort may be given to\r\nadvantage, by letting the class plot and study the weather signs taken\r\nfrom any current weather map. Instructive lessons may be taught by talking\r\nover, in the class, the different ways in which people all over the\r\ncountry are affected by the character of the weather that happens to\r\nprevail where they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTERS IX-XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe correlation exercises will, as a whole, teach few entirely new facts\r\nto the brighter scholars who have faithfully completed the preceding work\r\nin observations and in the construction and study of the daily weather\r\nmaps. These exercises do, however, lead to detailed examination and to the\r\ncareful working out of the relations which may have been previously\r\nnoticed in a general way only. They give the repeated illustration which\r\nis necessary in order to impress firmly on the mind the lesson that the\r\nweather map has to teach.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to let different scholars work out the problems for\r\ndifferent months. The results reached in each case should be discussed in\r\nthe class, and thus each member may have the double advantage of working\r\nout his own problem, and of profiting by the work done by his fellows.\r\nThroughout these exercises care should be taken to have weather maps of\r\nall months studied. The exercise on the correlation of the velocity of the\r\nwind with the pressure cannot be undertaken unless the work on\r\ntemperature and pressure gradients (Chapters V and VII) has been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTERS XX-XXV.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected that any one scholar can accomplish all that is here\r\noutlined. Examples may be selected from the list, as opportunity offers,\r\nso that each scholar shall become familiar with several problems.\r\n\r\nFew of the problems suggested call for continuous routine observation at\r\nfixed hours. They require, on the other hand, an intelligent examination\r\nof ordinary weather phenomena, with special reference to discovering their\r\nexplanation. In most of the problems a small number of observations will\r\nsuffice. Under the supervision of the teacher, different problems may be\r\nassigned to the several members of a class; or several scholars may work\r\non different parts of the same problem, exchanging records in order to\r\nsave time. All the scholars should have a general knowledge of the results\r\nwhich have been obtained from the observations made by the other members\r\nof their class. The teacher will use his discretion in arranging the order\r\nof the problems, and in selecting those that are best suited to the season\r\nin which the work is done, to the locality in which the school is\r\nsituated, and to the facilities and apparatus at command. Although the\r\nvariety of accessible problems is less in city schools than in country\r\nschools, much may be done in the city as well as in the country.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for carrying out such observational work vary so much in\r\ndifferent schools that it is impossible to give specific instructions,\r\nwhich shall be available in all cases. Some general suggestions are\r\ntherefore given, which the teacher may supplement by more detailed\r\ninstructions framed to fit the particular circumstances of each case.\r\n\r\nA review of the headings of the different problems shows that a very\r\ngeneral correlation exists among them, whereby the subjects of every\r\nheading are associated with those of nearly every other. In other words,\r\nevery weather element is treated as a function of several other elements.\r\nIt follows from this that the variety of work here outlined is more\r\napparent than real, and that many problems which appear from their wording\r\nto be entirely new are in large part rearrangements of problems previously\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n             THE EQUIPMENT OF A METEOROLOGICAL LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _A._ INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n_Exposed Thermometer_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern), with brass\r\nsupport, $2.75.\r\n\r\n_Maximum and Minimum Thermometers_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern),\r\nmounted together on one board, $6.25.\r\n\r\n_Wet- and Dry-Bulb Thermometers_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern),\r\nmounted on one board, complete with water cup, $6.50.\r\n\r\n_Sling Psychrometer_ (designed by Professor C.

Much less liable to be broken than the Weather\r\nBureau pattern, $5.00.\r\n\r\n_Rain Gauge_ (United States Weather Bureau standard), 8 inches in\r\ndiameter, complete, with measuring stick, $5.25.\r\n\r\n_Rain Gauge_, 3 inches in diameter, with overflow and measuring stick,\r\n$1.25.\r\n\r\n_Wind Vane_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern), $10.00.\r\n\r\n_Anemometer_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern), with indicator,\r\naluminum cups, and electrical attachment, $25.00.\r\n\r\nThe same, with painted brass cups, $23.00.\r\n\r\n_Anemometer Register_ (United States Weather Bureau pattern), with pen and\r\nink attachment, $35.00.\r\n\r\nThe same, with pencil attachment (old style), $24.00.\r\n\r\n_Aneroid Barometer_ (for meteorological work), $14.00-$16.00.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.——Much cheaper aneroids can be purchased, and may be used\r\n    to some advantage in the simpler observations in schools.\r\n\r\n_Mercurial Barometer_ (Standard United States Weather Bureau pattern),\r\ncomplete with attached thermometer, vernier, etc., $30.00-$33.00.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.——The above instruments, as used by the United States\r\n    Weather Bureau, are made by H. J. Green, 1191 Bedford Avenue,\r\n    Brooklyn, N. Y. The prices are those given in Green’s latest\r\n    catalogue.\r\n\r\n_Mercurial Barometer._ New improved form, especially designed for school\r\nuse. Mounted on mahogany back. Scale engraved on aluminum. Divisions of\r\nscale on metric and English systems. No vernier, $5.75.\r\n\r\n    (L. E. Knott Apparatus Co., 14 Ashburton Place, Boston, Mass.)\r\n\r\n_Thermograph_ (designed by Dr. Daniel Draper, of New York).

New York, D.\r\nAppleton & Co., 1898. 18mo, pp. 194. 40 cents.\r\n\r\nTo be recommended to the general reader who wishes to gain some knowledge\r\nof meteorology quickly. Not a text-book. Contains a chapter on “Flight in\r\nthe Atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n_Elementary Meteorology._ WILLIAM MORRIS DAVIS. Boston, Ginn & Co., 1898.\r\n8vo, pp. 355. $2.50.\r\n\r\nThe most complete of the modern text-books, and the best adapted for use\r\nin the systematic teaching of meteorology. The modern views are presented\r\nclearly and without the use of mathematics. Portions of it are somewhat\r\ntoo advanced for school study, but teachers will find it invaluable as a\r\nreference book in directing the laboratory work, and in answering the\r\nquestions of school classes.\r\n\r\n_A Popular Treatise on the Winds._ WILLIAM FERREL. New York, John Wiley &\r\nSons, 1890. 8vo, pp. 505. $3.40.\r\n\r\nThis can hardly be regarded as a _popular_ treatise. It embodies, in\r\ncondensed and chiefly non-mathematical form, the results of Ferrel’s\r\nresearches during his long and profound study of the general circulation\r\nand phenomena of the atmosphere. Teachers who advance far into meteorology\r\nwill find this book indispensable. It is not at all suited for general\r\nclass-room use.\r\n\r\n_American Weather._ A. W. GREELY. New York, Dodd, Mead & Co., 1888. 8vo,\r\npp. 286. Out of print, but secondhand copies are probably obtainable.\r\n\r\nDeals, as the title implies, especially with the weather phenomena of the\r\nUnited States.

Especially adapted for the\r\nuse of English readers.\r\n\r\n_Elementary Meteorology._ ROBERT H. SCOTT. International Scientific\r\nSeries. London, Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1885; Boston, A. A. Waterman &\r\nCo., 1889. 8vo, pp. 410. 6 shillings.\r\n\r\nThe standard text-book in Great Britain. The author is secretary to the\r\nMeteorological Council of the Royal Society. Fairly complete, but now\r\nsomewhat out of date in some portions. It is a useful book in a\r\nmeteorological library, but does not treat the subject in a way very\r\nhelpful to the teacher.\r\n\r\n_Meteorology._ THOMAS RUSSELL. New York, The Macmillan Company, 1895. 8vo,\r\npp. 277.\r\n\r\nBrief and incomplete as a text-book of meteorology, but containing a very\r\ncomprehensive account, fully illustrated, of rivers and floods in the\r\nUnited States, and their prediction.\r\n\r\n_Elementary Meteorology._ FRANK WALDO. New York, American Book Company,\r\n1896. 8vo, pp. 373. 90 cents.\r\n\r\nA compact summary. Useful to teachers as a handy reference book.\r\n\r\n_Modern Meteorology._ FRANK WALDO.

It is best to have the daily maps\r\nsent from the nearest map-publishing station, and not from Washington, as\r\nthe delay in the latter case is often so great that much of the immediate\r\nvalue of the maps is lost.\r\n\r\n_Climate and Crop Bulletin of the United States Weather Bureau._\r\nWashington, D. C. Monthly.\r\n\r\nChart showing, by means of small maps, the actual precipitation,\r\ndepartures from normal precipitation, departures from normal temperature,\r\nand maximum and minimum temperatures.

United States Department of Agriculture, Weather Bureau,\r\nBulletin D, Washington, D. C. 1897. 9-1/4 × 11-1/2 inches. Pp. 58. Charts\r\n10. Plates III.\r\n\r\nA more recent publication than the preceding one, the averages having been\r\ncompiled to the end of 1896. The charts are smaller than most of those in\r\nBulletin C, and therefore not so well adapted for class-room illustration.\r\nThe chart of mean annual precipitation is the latest and best published.\r\nThe rainfall of the crop-growing season receives separate treatment, and\r\nis illustrated by means of two charts. The discussion in the text is\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _F._ METEOROLOGICAL TABLES.\r\n\r\n_Smithsonian Meteorological Tables._ Smithsonian Miscellaneous\r\nCollections, 844.

equivalents with some\r\nwords replaced with commonly known abbreviations and possibly a key.\r\n\r\nThe table on page 44 has been flipped around a diagonal axis so that the\r\noriginal column headings are now row headings.\r\n\r\nThe following list indicates any additional changes made.
