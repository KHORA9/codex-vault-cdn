It is an iron-black, opaque mineral, with\r\nmetallic lustre; hardness about 6, sp. gr. 4.9 to 5.2. When scratched,\r\nit yields a black streak. It is an oxide of iron having the formula\r\nFe3O4, corresponding with 72.4% of metal, whence its great value as an\r\nore. It may be regarded as a ferroso-ferric oxide, FeO·Fe2O3, or as iron\r\nferrate, Fe´´Fe2´´´O4. Titanium is often present, and occasionally the\r\nmineral contains magnesium, nickel, &c. It is always strongly magnetic.\r\nMagnetite crystallizes in the cubic system, usually in octahedra, less\r\ncommonly in rhombic dodecahedra, and not infrequently in twins of the\r\n\"spinel type\" (fig. 1). The rhombic faces of the dodecahedron are often\r\nstriated parallel to the longer diagonal. There is no distinct cleavage,\r\nbut imperfect parting may be obtained along octahedral planes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nMagnetite is a mineral of wide distribution, occurring as grains in many\r\nmassive and volcanic rocks, like granite, diorite and dolerite. It\r\nappears to have crystallized from the magma at a very early period of\r\nconsolidation. Its presence contributes to the dark colour of many\r\nbasalts and other basic rocks, and may cause them to disturb the\r\ncompass. Large ore-bodies of granular and compact magnetite occur as\r\nbeds and lenticular masses in Archean gneiss and crystalline schists, in\r\nvarious parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Urals; as also in the\r\nstates of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as in\r\nCanada. In some cases it appears to have segregated from a basic\r\neruptive magma, and in other cases to have resulted from metamorphic\r\naction. Certain deposits appear to have been formed, directly or\r\nindirectly, by wet processes. Iron rust sometimes contains magnetite. An\r\ninteresting deposit of oolitic magnetic ore occurs in the Dogger\r\n(Inferior Oolite) of Rosedale Abbey, in Yorkshire; and a somewhat\r\nsimilar pisolitic ore, of Jurassic age, is known on the continent as\r\nchamoisite, having been named from Chamoison (or Chamoson) in the\r\nValais, Switzerland. Grains of magnetite occur in serpentine, as an\r\nalteration-product of the olivine. In emery, magnetite in a granular\r\nform is largely associated with the corundum; and in certain kinds of\r\nmica magnetite occurs as thin dendritic enclosures. Haematite is\r\nsometimes magnetic, and A. Liversidge has shown that magnetite is\r\nprobably present. By deoxidation, haematite may be converted into\r\nmagnetite, as proved by certain pseudomorphs; but on the other hand\r\nmagnetite is sometimes altered to haematite. On weathering, magnetite\r\ncommonly passes into limonite, the ferrous oxide having probably been\r\nremoved by carbonated waters. Closely related to magnetite is the rare\r\nvolcanic mineral from Vesuvius, called magnoferrite, or magnesioferrite,\r\nwith the formula MgFe2O4; and with this may be mentioned a mineral from\r\nJakobsberg, in Vermland, Sweden, called jakobsite, containing MnFe2O4.\r\n     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETOGRAPH, an instrument for continuously recording the values of the\r\nmagnetic elements, the three universally chosen being the declination,\r\nthe horizontal component and the vertical component (see TERRESTRIAL\r\nMAGNETISM). In each case the magnetograph only records the variation of\r\nthe element, the absolute values being determined by making observations\r\nin the neighbourhood with the unifilar magnetometer (q.v.) and\r\ninclinometer (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  _Declination._--The changes in declination are obtained by means of a\r\n  magnet which is suspended by a long fibre and carries a mirror,\r\n  immediately below which a fixed mirror is attached to the base of the\r\n  instrument. Both mirrors are usually concave; if plane, a concave lens\r\n  is placed immediately before them. Light passing through a vertical\r\n  slit falls upon the mirrors, from which it is reflected, and two\r\n  images of the slit are produced, one by the movable mirror attached to\r\n  the magnet and the other by the fixed mirror. These images would be\r\n  short lines of light; but a piano-cylindrical lens is placed with its\r\n  axis horizontal just in front of the recording surface. In this way a\r\n  spot of light is obtained from each mirror. The recording surface is a\r\n  sheet of photographic paper wrapped round a drum which is rotated at a\r\n  constant speed by clockwork about a horizontal axis. The light\r\n  reflected from the fixed mirror traces a straight line on the paper,\r\n  serving as a base line from which the variations in declination are\r\n  measured. As the declination changes the spot of light reflected from\r\n  the magnet mirror moves parallel to the axis of the recording drum,\r\n  and hence the distance between the line traced by this spot and the\r\n  base line gives, for any instant, on an arbitrary scale the difference\r\n  between the declination and a constant angle, namely, the declination\r\n  corresponding to the base line. The value of this constant angle is\r\n  obtained by comparing the record with the value for the declination as\r\n  measured with a magnetometer. The value in terms of arc of the scale\r\n  of the record can be obtained by measuring the distance between the\r\n  magnet mirror and the recording drum, and in most observations it is\r\n  such that a millimetre on the record represents one minute of arc. The\r\n  time scale ordinarily employed is 15 mm. per hour, but in modern\r\n  instruments provision is generally made for the time scale to be\r\n  increased at will to 180 mm. per hour, so that the more rapid\r\n  variations of the declination can be followed. The advantages of using\r\n  small magnets, so that their moment of inertia may be small and hence\r\n  they may be able to respond to rapid changes in the earth's field,\r\n  were first insisted upon by E. Mascart,[1] while M. Eschenhagen[2]\r\n  first designed a set of magnetographs in which this idea of small\r\n  moment of inertia was carried to its useful limit, the magnets only\r\n  weighing 1.5 gram each, and the suspension consisting of a very fine\r\n  quartz fibre.\r\n\r\n  _Horizontal Force._--The variation of the horizontal force is obtained\r\n  by the motion of a magnet which is carried either by a bifilar\r\n  suspension or by a fairly stiff metal wire or quartz fibre. The upper\r\n  end of the suspension is turned till the axis of the magnet is at\r\n  right angles to the magnetic meridian. In this position the magnet is\r\n  in equilibrium under the action of the torsion of the suspension and\r\n  the couple exerted by the horizontal component, H, of the earth's\r\n  field, this couple depending on the product of H into the magnetic\r\n  moment, M, of the magnet. Hence if H varies the magnet will rotate in\r\n  such a way that the couple due to torsion is equal to the new value of\r\n  H multiplied by M. Since the movements of the magnet are always small,\r\n  the rotation of the magnet is proportional to the change in H, so long\r\n  as M and the couple, [theta], corresponding to unit twist of the\r\n  suspension system remain constant. When the temperature changes,\r\n  however, both M and [theta] in general change. With rise of\r\n  temperature M decreases, and this alone will produce the same effect\r\n  as would a decrease in H. To allow for this effect of temperature a\r\n  compensating system of metal bars is attached to the upper end of the\r\n  bifilar suspension, so arranged that with rise of temperature the\r\n  fibres are brought nearer together and hence the value of [theta]\r\n  decreases. Since such a decrease in [theta] would by itself cause the\r\n  magnet to turn in the same direction as if H had increased, it is\r\n  possible in a great measure to neutralize the effects of temperature\r\n  on the reading of the instrument. In the case of the unifilar\r\n  suspension, the provision of a temperature compensation is not so\r\n  easy, so that what is generally done is to protect the instrument from\r\n  temperature variation as much as possible and then to correct the\r\n  indications so as to allow for the residual changes, a continuous\r\n  record of the temperature being kept by a recording thermograph\r\n  attached to the instrument. In the Eschenhagen pattern instrument, in\r\n  which a single quartz fibre is used for the suspension, two magnets\r\n  are placed in the vicinity of the suspended magnet and are so arranged\r\n  that their field partly neutralizes the earth's field; thus the\r\n  torsion required to hold the magnet with its axis perpendicular to the\r\n  earth's field is reduced, and the arrangement permits of the\r\n  sensitiveness being altered by changing the position of the deflecting\r\n  magnets. Further, by suitably choosing the positions of the deflectors\r\n  and the coefficient of torsion of the fibre, it is possible to make\r\n  the temperature coefficient vanish. (See Adolf Schmidt, _Zeits. für\r\n  Instrumentenkunde_, 1907, 27, 145.) The method of recording the\r\n  variations in H is exactly the same as that adopted in the case of the\r\n  declination, and the sensitiveness generally adopted is such that 1\r\n  mm. on the record represents a change in H of .00005 C.G.S., the time\r\n  scale being the same as that employed in the case of the declination.\r\n\r\n  _Vertical Component._--To record the variations of the vertical\r\n  component use is made of a magnet mounted on knife edges so that it\r\n  can turn freely about a horizontal axis at right angles to its length\r\n  (H. Lloyd, _Proc. Roy. Irish Acad._, 1839, 1, 334). The magnet is so\r\n  weighted that its axis is approximately horizontal, and any change in\r\n  the inclination of the axis is observed by means of an attached\r\n  mirror, a second mirror fixed to the stand serving to give a base line\r\n  for the records, which are obtained in the same way as in the case of\r\n  the declination. The magnet is in equilibrium under the influence of\r\n  the couple VM due to the vertical component V, and the couple due to\r\n  the fact that the centre of gravity is slightly on one side of the\r\n  knife-edge. Hence when, say, V decreases the couple VM decreases, and\r\n  hence the north end of the balanced magnet rises, and vice versa. The\r\n  chief difficulty with this form of instrument is that it is very\r\n  sensitive to changes of temperature, for such changes not only alter M\r\n  but also in general cause the centre of gravity of the system to be\r\n  displaced with reference to the knife-edge. To reduce these effects\r\n  the magnet is fitted with compensating bars, generally of zinc, so\r\n  adjusted by trial that as far as possible they neutralize the effect\r\n  of changes of temperature. In the Eschenhagen form of vertical force\r\n  balance two deflecting magnets are used to partly neutralize the\r\n  vertical component, so that the centre of gravity is almost exactly\r\n  over the support. By varying the positions of these deflecting magnets\r\n  it is possible to compensate for the effects of changes of temperature\r\n  (A. Schmidt, loc. cit.). In order to eliminate the irregularity which\r\n  is apt to be introduced by dust, &c., interfering with the working of\r\n  the knife-edge, W. Watson (_Phil. Mag._, 1904 [6], 7, 393) designed a\r\n  form of vertical force balance in which the magnet with its mirror is\r\n  attached to the mid point of a horizontal stretched quartz fibre. The\r\n  temperature compensation is obtained by attaching a small weight to\r\n  the magnet, and then bringing it back to the horizontal position by\r\n  twisting the fibre.\r\n\r\n  The scale values of the records given by the horizontal and vertical\r\n  force magnetographs are determined by deflecting the respective\r\n  needles, either by means of a magnet placed at a known distance or by\r\n  passing an electric current through circular coils of large diameter\r\n  surrounding the instruments.\r\n\r\n  The width of the photographic sheet which receives the spot of light\r\n  reflected from the mirrors in the above instruments is generally so\r\n  great that in the case of ordinary changes the curve does not go off\r\n  the paper. Occasionally, however, during a disturbance such is not the\r\n  case, and hence a portion of the trace would be lost. To overcome this\r\n  difficulty Eschenhagen in his earlier type of instruments attached to\r\n  each magnet two mirrors, their planes being inclined at a small angle\r\n  so that when the spot reflected from one mirror goes off the paper,\r\n  that corresponding to the other comes on. In the later pattern a third\r\n  mirror is added of which the plane is inclined at about 30° to the\r\n  horizontal. The light from the slit is reflected on to this mirror by\r\n  an inclined fixed mirror, and after reflection at the movable mirror\r\n  is again reflected at the fixed mirror and so reaches the recording\r\n  drum. By this arrangement the angular rotation of the reflected beam\r\n  is less than that of the magnet, and hence the spot of light reflected\r\n  from this mirror yields a trace on a much smaller scale than that\r\n  given by the ordinary mirror and serves to give a complete record of\r\n  even the most energetic disturbance.\r\n\r\n  See also Balfour Stewart, _Report of the British Association_,\r\n  Aberdeen, 1859, 200, a description of the type of instrument used in\r\n  the older observatories; E.

For the instruments\r\nand methods used in measuring the dip see INCLINOMETER. It remains to\r\nconsider the measurement of the declination and the horizontal\r\ncomponent, these two elements being generally measured with the same\r\ninstrument, which is called a unifilar magnetometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Unifilar Magnetometer, arranged to indicate\r\ndeclination.]\r\n\r\n  _Measurement of Declination._--The measurement of the declination\r\n  involves two separate observations, namely, the determination of (a)\r\n  the magnetic meridian and (b) the geographical meridian, the angle\r\n  between the two being the declination. In order to determine the\r\n  magnetic meridian the orientation of the magnetic axis of a freely\r\n  suspended magnet is observed; while, in the absence of a distant mark\r\n  of which the azimuth is known, the geographical meridian is obtained\r\n  from observations of the transit of the sun or a star. The geometrical\r\n  axis of the magnet is sometimes defined by means of a mirror rigidly\r\n  attached to the magnet and having the normal to the mirror as nearly\r\n  as may be parallel to the magnetic axis. This arrangement is not very\r\n  convenient, as it is difficult to protect the mirror from accidental\r\n  displacement, so that the angle between the geometrical and magnetic\r\n  axes may vary. For this reason the end of the magnet is sometimes\r\n  polished and acts as the mirror, in which case no displacement of the\r\n  reflecting surface with reference to the magnet is possible. A\r\n  different arrangement, used in the instrument described below,\r\n  consists in having the magnet hollow, with a small scale engraved on\r\n  glass firmly attached at one end, while to the other end is attached a\r\n  lens, so chosen that the scale is at its principal focus. In this case\r\n  the geometrical axis is the line joining the central division of the\r\n  scale to the optical centre of the lens. The position of the magnet is\r\n  observed by means of a small telescope, and since the scale is at the\r\n  principal focus of the lens, the scale will be in focus when the\r\n  telescope is adjusted to observe a distant object. Thus no alteration\r\n  in the focus of the telescope is necessary whether we are observing\r\n  the magnet, a distant fixed mark, or the sun.\r\n\r\n  The Kew Observatory pattern unifilar magnetometer is shown in figs. 1\r\n  and 2. The magnet consists of a hollow steel cylinder fitted with a\r\n  scale and lens as described above, and is suspended by a long thread\r\n  of unspun silk, which is attached at the upper end to the torsion head\r\n  H. The magnet is protected from draughts by the box A, which is closed\r\n  at the sides by two shutters when an observation is being taken. The\r\n  telescope B serves to observe the scale attached to the magnet when\r\n  determining the magnetic meridian, and to observe the sun or star when\r\n  determining the geographical meridian.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Unifilar Magnetometer, arranged to show\r\n  deflexion.]\r\n\r\n  When making a determination of declination a brass plummet having the\r\n  same weight as the magnet is first suspended in its place, and the\r\n  torsion of the fibre is taken out. The magnet having been attached,\r\n  the instrument is rotated about its vertical axis till the centre\r\n  division of the scale appears to coincide with the vertical cross-wire\r\n  of the telescope. The two verniers on the azimuth circle having been\r\n  read, the magnet is then inverted, i.e. turned through 180° about its\r\n  axis, and the setting is repeated. A second setting with the magnet\r\n  inverted is generally made, and then another setting with the magnet\r\n  in its original position. The mean of all the readings of the verniers\r\n  gives the reading on the azimuth circle corresponding to the magnetic\r\n  meridian. To obtain the geographical meridian the box A is removed,\r\n  and an image of the sun or a star is reflected into the telescope B by\r\n  means of a small transit mirror N. This mirror can rotate about a\r\n  horizontal axis which is at right angles to the line of collimation of\r\n  the telescope, and is parallel to the surface of the mirror. The time\r\n  of transit of the sun or star across the vertical wire of the\r\n  telescope having been observed by means of a chronometer of which the\r\n  error is known, it is possible to calculate the azimuth of the sun or\r\n  star, if the latitude and longitude of the place of observation are\r\n  given. Hence if the readings of the verniers on the azimuth circle are\r\n  made when the transit is observed we can deduce the reading\r\n  corresponding to the geographical meridian.\r\n\r\n  The above method of determining the geographical meridian has the\r\n  serious objection that it is necessary to know the error of the\r\n  chronometer with very considerable accuracy, a matter of some\r\n  difficulty when observing at any distance from a fixed observatory.\r\n  If, however, a theodolite, fitted with a telescope which can rotate\r\n  about a horizontal axis and having an altitude circle, is employed, so\r\n  that when observing a transit the altitude of the sun or star can be\r\n  read off, then the time need only be known to within a minute or so.\r\n  Hence in more recent patterns of magnetometer it is usual to do away\r\n  with the transit mirror method of observing and either to use a\r\n  separate theodolite to observe the azimuth of some distant object,\r\n  which will then act as a fixed mark when making the declination\r\n  observations, or to attach to the magnetometer an altitude telescope\r\n  and circle for use when determining the geographical meridian.\r\n\r\n  The chief uncertainty in declination observations, at any rate at a\r\n  fixed observatory, lies in the variable torsion of the silk\r\n  suspension, as it is found that, although the fibre may be entirely\r\n  freed from torsion before beginning the declination observations, yet\r\n  at the conclusion of these observations a considerable amount of\r\n  torsion may have appeared. Soaking the fibre with glycerine, so that\r\n  the moisture it absorbs does not change so much with the hygrometric\r\n  state of the air, is of some advantage, but does not entirely remove\r\n  the difficulty. For this reason some observers use a thin strip of\r\n  phosphor bronze to suspend the magnet, considering that the absence of\r\n  a variable torsion more than compensates for the increased difficulty\r\n  in handling the more fragile metallic suspension.\r\n\r\n  _Measurement of the Horizontal Component of the Earth's Field._--The\r\n  method of measuring the horizontal component which is almost\r\n  exclusively used, both in fixed observatories and in the field,\r\n  consists in observing the period of a freely suspended magnet, and\r\n  then obtaining the angle through which an auxiliary suspended magnet\r\n  is deflected by the magnet used in the first part of the experiment.\r\n  By the vibration experiment we obtain the value of the product of the\r\n  magnetic moment (M) of the magnet into the horizontal component (H),\r\n  while by the deflexion experiment we can deduce the value of the ratio\r\n  of M to H, and hence the two combined give both M and H.\r\n\r\n  In the case of the Kew pattern unifilar the same magnet that is used\r\n  for the declination is usually employed for determining H, and for the\r\n  purposes of the vibration experiment it is mounted as for the\r\n  observation of the magnetic meridian. The time of vibration is\r\n  obtained by means of a chronometer, using the eye-and-ear method. The\r\n  temperature of the magnet must also be observed, for which purpose a\r\n  thermometer C (fig. 1) is attached to the box A.\r\n\r\n  When making the deflection experiment the magnetometer is arranged as\r\n  shown in fig. 2. The auxiliary magnet has a plane mirror attached, the\r\n  plane of which is at right angles to the axis of the magnet. An image\r\n  of the ivory scale B is observed after reflection in the magnet mirror\r\n  by the telescope A. The magnet K used in the vibration experiment is\r\n  supported on a carriage L which can slide along the graduated bar D.\r\n  The axis of the magnet is horizontal and at the same level as the\r\n  mirror magnet, while when the central division of the scale B appears\r\n  to coincide with the vertical cross-wire of the telescope the axes of\r\n  the two magnets are at right angles. During the experiment the mirror\r\n  magnet is protected from draughts by two wooden doors which slide in\r\n  grooves. What is known as the method of sines is used, for since the\r\n  axes of the two magnets are always at right angles when the mirror\r\n  magnet is in its zero position, the ratio M/H is proportional to the\r\n  sine of the angle between the magnetic axis of the mirror magnet and\r\n  the magnetic meridian. When conducting a deflexion experiment the\r\n  deflecting magnet K is placed with its centre at 30 cm. from the\r\n  mirror magnet and to the east of the latter, and the whole instrument\r\n  is turned till the centre division of the scale B coincides with the\r\n  cross-wire of the telescope, when the readings of the verniers on the\r\n  azimuth circle are noted. The magnet K is then reversed in the\r\n  support, and a new setting taken. The difference between the two sets\r\n  of readings gives twice the angle which the magnetic axis of the\r\n  mirror magnet makes with the magnetic meridian. In order to eliminate\r\n  any error due to the zero of the scale D not being exactly below the\r\n  mirror magnet, the support L is then removed to the west side of the\r\n  instrument, and the settings are repeated. Further, to allow of a\r\n  correction being applied for the finite length of the magnets the\r\n  whole series of settings is repeated with the centre of the deflecting\r\n  magnet at 40 cm. from the mirror magnet.\r\n\r\n  Omitting correction terms depending on the temperature and on the\r\n  inductive effect of the earth's magnetism on the moment of the\r\n  deflecting magnet, if [theta] is the angle which the axis of the\r\n  deflected magnet makes with the meridian when the centre of the\r\n  deflecting magnet is at a distance r, then\r\n\r\n    r³H                    P     Q\r\n    --- sin [theta] = 1 + --- + --- + &c.,\r\n    2M                     r     r²\r\n\r\n  in which P and Q are constants depending on the dimensions and\r\n  magnetic states of the two magnets. The value of the constants P and Q\r\n  can be obtained by making deflexion experiments at three distances. It\r\n  is, however, possible by suitably choosing the proportions of the two\r\n  magnets to cause either P or Q to be very small. Thus it is usual, if\r\n  the magnets are of similar shape, to make the deflected magnet 0.467\r\n  of the length of the deflecting magnet, in which case Q is negligible,\r\n  and thus by means of deflexion experiments at two distances the value\r\n  of P can be obtained. (See C. Börgen, _Terrestrial Magnetism_, 1896,\r\n  i. p. 176, and C. Chree, _Phil. Mag._, 1904 [6], 7, p. 113.)\r\n\r\n  In the case of the vibration experiment correction terms have to be\r\n  introduced to allow for the temperature of the magnet, for the\r\n  inductive effect of the earth's field, which slightly increases the\r\n  magnetic moment of the magnet, and for the torsion of the suspension\r\n  fibre, as well as the rate of the chronometer. If the temperature of\r\n  the magnet were always exactly the same in both the vibration and\r\n  deflexion experiment, then no correction on account of the effect of\r\n  temperature in the magnetic moment would be necessary in either\r\n  experiment. The fact that the moment of inertia of the magnet varies\r\n  with the temperature must, however, be taken into account. In the\r\n  deflexion experiment, in addition to the induction correction, and\r\n  that for the effect of temperature on the magnetic moment, a\r\n  correction has to be applied for the effect of temperature on the\r\n  length of the bar which supports the deflexion magnet.\r\n\r\n  See also Stewart and Gee, _Practical Physics_, vol. 2, containing a\r\n  description of the Kew pattern unifilar magnetometer and detailed\r\n  instructions for performing the experiments; C.

The movements of a\r\nship entirely preclude the employment of any instrument in which a\r\nmagnet suspended by a fibre has any part, so that the unifilar is\r\nunsuited for such observations. In order to obtain the declination a\r\npivoted magnet is used to obtain the magnetic meridian, the geographical\r\nmeridian being obtained by observations on the sun or stars. A carefully\r\nmade ship's compass is usually employed, though in some cases the\r\ncompass card, with its attached magnets, is made reversible, so that the\r\ninclination to the zero of the card of the magnetic axis of the system\r\nof magnets attached to the card can be eliminated by reversal. In the\r\nabsence of such a reversible card the index correction must be\r\ndetermined by comparison with a unifilar magnetometer, simultaneous\r\nobservations being made on shore, and these observations repeated as\r\noften as occasion permits. To determine the dip a Fox's dip circle[1] is\r\nused. This consists of an ordinary dip circle (see INCLINOMETER) in\r\nwhich the ends of the axle of the needle are pointed and rest in\r\njewelled holes, so that the movements of the ship do not displace the\r\nneedle. The instrument is, of course, supported on a gimballed table,\r\nwhile the ship during the observations is kept on a fixed course. To\r\nobtain the _strength_ of the field the method usually adopted is that\r\nknown as Lloyd's method.[2] To carry out a determination of the total\r\nforce by this method the Fox dip circle has been slightly modified by E.\r\nW. Creak, and has been found to give satisfactory results on board ship.\r\nThe circle is provided with two needles in addition to those used for\r\ndetermining the dip, one (a) an ordinary dip needle, and the other (b) a\r\nneedle which has been loaded at one end by means of a small peg which\r\nfits into one of two symmetrically placed holes in the needle. The\r\nmagnetism of these two needles is never reversed, and they are as much\r\nas possible protected from shock and from approach to other magnets, so\r\nthat their magnetic state may remain as constant as possible. Attached\r\nto the cross-arm which carries the microscopes used to observe the ends\r\nof the dipping needle is a clamp, which will hold the needle _b_ in such\r\na way that its plane is parallel to the vertical circle and its axis is\r\nat right angles to the line joining the two microscopes. Hence, when the\r\nmicroscopes are adjusted so as to coincide with the points of the\r\ndipping needle _a_, the axes of the two needles must be at right angles.\r\nThe needle _a_ being suspended between the jewels, and the needle _b_\r\nbeing held in the clamp, the cross-arm carrying the reading microscopes\r\nand the needle _b_ is rotated till the ends of the needle a coincide\r\nwith the cross-wires of the microscopes. The verniers having been read,\r\nthe cross-arm is rotated so as to deflect the needle _a_ in the opposite\r\ndirection, and a new setting is taken. Half the difference between the\r\ntwo readings gives the angle through which the needle a has been\r\ndeflected under the action of the needle _b_. This angle depends on the\r\nratio of the magnetic moment of the needle _b_ to the total force of the\r\nearth's field. It also involves, of course, the distance between the\r\nneedles and the distribution of the magnetism of the needles; but this\r\nfactor is determined by comparing the value given by the instrument, at\r\na shore station, with that given by an ordinary magnetometer. Hence the\r\nabove observation gives us a means of obtaining the _ratio_ of the\r\nmagnetic moment of the needle _b_ to the value of the earth's total\r\nforce. The needle _b_ is then substituted for _a_, there being now no\r\nneedle in the clamp attached to the microscope arm, and the difference\r\nbetween the reading now obtained and the dip, together with the weight\r\nadded to the needle, gives the product of the moment of the needle _b_\r\ninto the earth's total force. Hence, from the two observations the value\r\nof the earth's total force can be deduced. In an actual observation the\r\ndeflecting needle would be reversed, as well as the deflected one, while\r\ndifferent weights would be used to deflect the needle _b_.\r\n\r\n  For a description of the method of using the Fox circle for\r\n  observations at sea consult the _Admiralty Manual of Scientific\r\n  Inquiry_, p. 116, while a description of the most recent form of the\r\n  circle, known as the Lloyd-Creak pattern, will be found in\r\n  _Terrestrial Magnetism_, 1901, 6, p. 119. An attachment to the\r\n  ordinary ship's compass, by means of which satisfactory measurements\r\n  of the horizontal component have been made on board ship, is described\r\n  by L. A. Bauer in _Terrestrial Magnetism_, 1906, 11, p. 78. The\r\n  principle of the method consists in deflecting the compass needle by\r\n  means of a horizontal magnet supported vertically over the compass\r\n  card, the axis of the deflecting magnet being always perpendicular to\r\n  the axis of the magnet attached to the card. The method is not\r\n  strictly an absolute one, since it presupposes a knowledge of the\r\n  magnetic moment of the deflecting magnet. In practice it is found that\r\n  a magnet can be prepared which, when suitably protected from shock,\r\n  &c., retains its magnetic moment sufficiently constant to enable\r\n  observations of H to be made comparable in accuracy with that of the\r\n  other elements obtained by the instruments ordinarily employed at sea.\r\n       (W. Wn.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Annals of Electricity_, 1839, 3, p. 288.\r\n\r\n  [2] Humphrey Lloyd, _Proc. Roy. Irish Acad._, 1848, 4, p. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETO-OPTICS. The first relation between magnetism and light was\r\ndiscovered by Faraday,[1] who proved that the plane of polarization of a\r\nray of light was rotated when the ray travelled through certain\r\nsubstances parallel to the lines of magnetic force. This power of\r\nrotating the plane of polarization in a magnetic field has been shown to\r\nbe possessed by all refracting substances, whether they are in the\r\nsolid, liquid or gaseous state. The rotation by gases was established\r\nindependently by H. Becquerel,[2] and Kundt and Röntgen,[3] while\r\nKundt[4] found that films of the magnetic metals, iron, cobalt, nickel,\r\nthin enough to be transparent, produced enormous rotations, these being\r\nin iron and cobalt magnetized to saturation at the rate of 200,000° per\r\ncm. of thickness, and in nickel about 89,000°. The direction of rotation\r\nis not the same in all bodies. If we call the rotation positive when it\r\nis related to the direction of the magnetic force, like rotation and\r\ntranslation in a right-handed screw, or, what is equivalent, when it is\r\nin the direction of the electric currents which would produce a magnetic\r\nfield in the same direction as that which produces the rotation, then\r\nmost substances produce positive rotation. Among those that produce\r\nnegative rotation are ferrous and ferric salts, ferricyanide of\r\npotassium, the salts of lanthanum, cerium and didymium, and chloride of\r\ntitanium.[5]\r\n\r\n  The magnetic metals iron, nickel, cobalt, the salts of nickel and\r\n  cobalt, and oxygen (the most magnetic gas) produce positive rotation.\r\n\r\n  For slightly magnetizable substances the amount of rotation in a space\r\n  PQ is proportional to the difference between the magnetic potential at\r\n  P and Q; or if [theta] is the rotation in PQ, [Omega]_P, [Omega]_Q,\r\n  the magnetic potential at P and Q, then [theta] = R([Omega]_P -\r\n  [Omega]_Q), where R is a constant, called Verdet's constant, which\r\n  depends upon the refracting substance, the wave length of the light,\r\n  and the temperature. The following are the values of R (when the\r\n  rotation is expressed in circular measure) for the D line and a\r\n  temperature of 18° C.:--\r\n\r\n          Substance.         R × 10^5.

They find if R_t, R0 are the values of Verdet's constant at\r\n  t°C and 0°C. respectively, then for carbon bisulphide R_t = R0 (1 -\r\n  .0016961), and for water R_t = R0 (1 - .0000305t - .00000305t²).\r\n\r\n  For the magnetic metals Kundt found that the rotation did not increase\r\n  so rapidly as the magnetic force, but that as this force was increased\r\n  the rotation reached a maximum value. This suggests that the rotation\r\n  is proportional to the intensity of magnetization, and not to the\r\n  magnetic force.\r\n\r\n  The amount of rotation in a given field depends greatly upon the wave\r\n  length of the light; the shorter the wave length the greater the\r\n  rotation, the rotation varying a little more rapidly than the inverse\r\n  square of the wave length. Verdet[11] has compared in the cases of\r\n  carbon bisulphide and creosote the rotation given by the formula\r\n\r\n                           c²      /               di    \\\r\n    [theta] = mc[gamma] --------- ( c - [lamda] --------- )\r\n                        [lambda]²  \\            d[lambda]/\r\n\r\n  with those actually observed; in this formula [theta] is the angular\r\n  rotation of the plane of polarization, m a constant depending on the\r\n  medium, [lambda] the wave length of the light in air, and i its index\r\n  of refraction in the medium. Verdet found that, though the agreement\r\n  is fair, the differences are greater than can be explained by errors\r\n  of experiment.\r\n\r\nVerdet[12] has shown that the rotation of a salt solution is the sum of\r\nthe rotations due to the salt and the solvent; thus, by mixing a salt\r\nwhich produces negative rotation with water which produces positive\r\nrotation, it is possible to get a solution which does not exhibit any\r\nrotation. Such solutions are not in general magnetically neutral. By\r\nmixing diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances we can get magnetically\r\nneutral solutions, which, however, produce a finite rotation of the\r\nplane of polarization. The relation of the magnetic rotation to chemical\r\nconstitution has been studied in great detail by Perkin,[13]\r\nWachsmuth,[14] Jahn[15] and Schönrock.[16]\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the plane of polarization may conveniently be regarded\r\nas denoting that the velocity of propagation of circular-polarized light\r\ntravelling along the lines of magnetic force depends upon the direction\r\nof rotation of the ray, the velocity when the rotation is related to the\r\ndirection of the magnetic force, like rotation and translation on a\r\nright-handed screw being different from that for a left-handed rotation.\r\nA plane-polarized ray may be regarded as compounded of two oppositely\r\ncircularly-polarized rays, and as these travel along the lines of\r\nmagnetic force with different velocities, the one will gain or lose in\r\nphase on the other, so that when they are again compounded they will\r\ncorrespond to a plane-polarized ray, but in consequence of the change of\r\nphase the plane of polarization will not coincide with its original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n_Reflection from a Magnet._--Kerr[17] in 1877 found that when\r\nplane-polarized light is incident on the pole of an electromagnet,\r\npolished so as to act like a mirror, the plane of polarization of the\r\nreflected light is rotated by the magnet. Further experiments on this\r\nphenomenon have been made by Righi,[18] Kundt,[19] Du Bois,[20]\r\nSissingh,[21] Hall,[22] Hurion,[23] Kaz[24] and Zeeman.[25] The simplest\r\ncase is when the incident plane-polarized light falls normally on the\r\npole of an electromagnet. When the magnet is not excited the reflected\r\nray is plane-polarized; when the magnet is excited the plane of\r\npolarization is rotated through a small angle, the direction of rotation\r\nbeing opposite to that of the currents exciting the pole. Righi found\r\nthat the reflected light was slightly elliptically polarized, the axes\r\nof the ellipse being of very unequal magnitude. A piece of gold-leaf\r\nplaced over the pole entirely stops the rotation, showing that it is not\r\nproduced in the air near the pole. Rotation takes place from magnetized\r\nnickel and cobalt as well as from iron, and is in the same direction\r\n(Hall). Righi has shown that the rotation at reflection is greater for\r\nlong waves than for short, whereas, as we have seen, the Faraday\r\nrotation is greater for short waves than for long. The rotation for\r\ndifferent coloured light from iron, nickel, cobalt and magnetite has\r\nbeen measured by Du Bois; in magnetite the direction of rotation is\r\nopposite to that of the other metals. When the light is incident\r\nobliquely and not normally on the polished pole of an electromagnet, it\r\nis elliptically polarized after reflection, even when the plane of\r\npolarization is parallel or at right angles to the plane of incidence.\r\nAccording to Righi, the amount of rotation when the plane of\r\npolarization of the incident light is perpendicular to the plane of\r\nincidence reaches a maximum when the angle of incidence is between 44°\r\nand 68°, while when the light is polarized in the plane of incidence the\r\nrotation steadily decreases as the angle of incidence is increased. The\r\nrotation when the light is polarized in the plane of incidence is always\r\nless than when it is polarized at right angles to that plane, except\r\nwhen the incidence is normal, when the two rotations are of course\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n_Reflection from Tangentially Magnetized Iron._--In this case Kerr[26]\r\nfound: (1) When the plane of incidence is perpendicular to the lines of\r\nmagnetic force, no rotation of the reflected light is produced by\r\nmagnetization; (2) no rotation is produced when the light is incident\r\nnormally; (3) when the incidence is oblique, the lines of magnetic force\r\nbeing in the plane of incidence, the reflected light is elliptically\r\npolarized after reflection, and the axes of the ellipse are not in and\r\nat right angles to the plane of incidence. When the light is polarized\r\nin the plane of incidence, the rotation is at all angles of incidence in\r\nthe opposite direction to that of the currents which would produce a\r\nmagnetic field of the same sign as the magnet. When the light is\r\npolarized at right angles to the plane of incidence, the rotation is in\r\nthe same direction as these currents when the angle of incidence is\r\nbetween 0° and 75° according to Kerr, between 0° and 80° according to\r\nKundt, and between 0° and 78° 54´ according to Righi. When the incidence\r\nis more oblique than this, the rotation of the plane of polarization is\r\nin the opposite direction to the electric currents which would produce a\r\nmagnetic field of the same sign.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the phenomena just described has been dealt with by\r\nAiry,[27] C. Neumann,[28] Maxwell,[29] Fitzgerald,[30] Rowland,[31] H.\r\nA. Lorentz,[32] Voight,[33] Ketteler,[34] van Loghem,[35] Potier,[36]\r\nBasset,[37] Goldhammer,[38] Drude,[39] J. J. Thomson,[40] and\r\nLeatham;[41] for a critical discussion of many of these theories we\r\nrefer the reader to Larmor's[42] British Association Report. Most of\r\nthese theories have proceeded on the plan of adding to the expression\r\nfor the electromotive force terms indicating a force similar in\r\ncharacter to that discovered by Hall (see MAGNETISM) in metallic\r\nconductors carrying a current in a magnetic field, i.e. an electromotive\r\nforce at right angles to the plane containing the magnetic force and the\r\nelectric current, and proportional to the sine of the angle between\r\nthese vectors. The introduction of a term of this kind gives rotation of\r\nthe plane of polarization by transmission through all refracting\r\nsubstance, and by reflection from magnetized metals, and shows a fair\r\nagreement between the theoretical and experimental results. The simplest\r\nway of treating the questions seems, however, to be to go to the\r\nequations which represent the propagation of a wave travelling through a\r\nmedium containing ions. A moving ion in a magnetic field will be acted\r\nupon by a mechanical force which is at right angles to its direction of\r\nmotion, and also to the magnetic force, and is equal per unit charge to\r\nthe product of these two vectors and the sine of the angle between them.\r\nFor the sake of brevity we will take the special case of a wave\r\ntravelling parallel to the magnetic force in the direction of the axis\r\nof z.\r\n\r\n  Then supposing that all the ions are of the same kind, and that there\r\n  are _n_ of these each with mass _m_ and charge _e_ per unit volume,\r\n  the equations representing the field are (see ELECTRIC WAVES):--\r\n\r\n       dX0           d[xi]   d[beta]\r\n    K0 --- + 4[pi]ne ----- = -------;\r\n       dt             dt       dz\r\n\r\n    dX[0]   d[beta]\r\n    ----- = -------;\r\n     dz       dt\r\n\r\n       dY0           d[eta]     d[alpha]\r\n    K0 --- + 4[pi]ne ------ = - --------\r\n       dt              dt          dz\r\n\r\n    dY0     d[alpha]\r\n    --- = - --------;\r\n    dz         dt\r\n\r\n      d²[xi]      d[xi]            /     4[pi]       \\         d[eta]\r\n    m ------ + R1 ----- + a[xi] = ( X0 + ----- ne[xi] ) e + He ------\r\n        dt²        dt              \\       3         /           dt\r\n\r\n      d²[eta]      d[eta]             /     4[pi]        \\         d[xi]\r\n    m ------- + R1 ------ + a[eta] = ( Y0 + ----- ne[eta] ) e - He -----;\r\n        dt²          dt               \\       3          /           dt\r\n\r\n  where H is the external magnetic field, X0, Y0 the components of the\r\n  part of the electric force in the wave not due to the charges on the\r\n  atoms, [alpha] and [beta] the components of the magnetic force, [xi]\r\n  and [eta] the co-ordinates of an ion, R1 the coefficient of resistance\r\n  to the motion of the ions, and [alpha] the force at unit distance\r\n  tending to bring the ion back to its position of equilibrium, K0 the\r\n  specific inductive capacity of a vacuum. If the variables are\r\n  proportional to [epsilon]^[l(pt - qz)] we find by substitution that q\r\n  is given by the equation\r\n\r\n                4[pi]ne²p²P     4[pi]ne³Hp³\r\n    q² - K0p² - ----------- = ± -----------,\r\n                P² - H²e²p²     P² - H²e²p²\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    P = (a - (4/3)[pi]ne²) + R1[iota]p - mp²,\r\n\r\n  or, by neglecting R, P = m(s² - p²), where s is the period of the free\r\n  ions. If, q1², q2² are the roots of this equation, then corresponding\r\n  to q1 we have X0 = [iota]Y0 and to q2 X0 = -[iota]Y0. We thus get two\r\n  oppositely circular-polarized rays travelling with the velocities p/q1\r\n  and p/q2 respectively. Hence if v1, v2 are these velocities, and v the\r\n  velocity when there is no magnetic field, we obtain, if we neglect\r\n  terms in H²,\r\n\r\n     1    1     4[pi]ne³Hp\r\n    --- = -- + ------------,\r\n    v1²   v²   m²(s² - p²)²\r\n\r\n     1    1     4[pi]ne³Hp\r\n    --- = -- - ------------.\r\n    v2²   v²   m²(s² - p²)²\r\n\r\n  The rotation r of the plane of polarization per unit length\r\n\r\n          / 1     1  \\    2[pi]ne³Hp²v\r\n    = ½p ( --- - ---  ) = -------------.\r\n          \\ v1    v2 /     m²(s² - p²)²\r\n\r\n  Since 1/v² = K0 + 4[pi]ne²/m(s² - p²), we have if µ is the refractive\r\n  index for light of frequency p, and v0 the velocity of light in vacuo.\r\n\r\n    µ² - 1 = 4[pi]ne²v²0 / m(s² - p²)  (1)\r\n\r\n  So that we may put\r\n\r\n    r = (µ² - 1)²p²H / s[pi]µne v0³  (2)\r\n\r\n  Becquerel (_Comptes rendus_, 125, p. 683) gives for r the expression\r\n\r\n       e   H      dµ\r\n    ½ --- ---- ---------,\r\n       m   v0  d[lambda]\r\n\r\n  where [lambda] is the wave length. This is equivalent to (2) if µ is\r\n  given by (1). He has shown that this expression is in good agreement\r\n  with experiment. The sign of r depends on the sign of e, hence the\r\n  rotation due to negative ions would be opposite to that for positive.\r\n  For the great majority of substances the direction of rotation is that\r\n  corresponding to the negation ion. We see from the equations that the\r\n  rotation is very large for such a value of p as makes P = 0: this\r\n  value corresponds to a free period of the ions, so that the rotation\r\n  ought to be very large in the neighbourhood of an absorption band.\r\n  This has been verified for sodium vapour by Macaluso and Corbino.[43]\r\n\r\n  If plane-polarized light falls normally on a plane face of the medium\r\n  containing the ions, then if the electric force in the incident wave\r\n  is parallel to x and is equal to the real part of A[epsilon]^[l(pt -\r\n  qz)], if the reflected beam in which the electric force is parallel to\r\n  x is represented by B[epsilon]^[l(pt + qz)] and the reflected beam in\r\n  which the electric force is parallel to the axis of y by\r\n  C[epsilon]^[l(pt + qz)], then the conditions that the magnetic force\r\n  parallel to the surface is continuous, and that the electric forces\r\n  parallel to the surface in the air are continuous with Y0, X0 in the\r\n  medium, give\r\n\r\n            A                B         [iota]C\r\n    ----------------- = ----------- = ----------\r\n    (q + q1) (q + q2)   (q² - q1q2)   q(q2 - q1)\r\n\r\n  or approximately, since q1 and q2 are nearly equal,\r\n\r\n    [iota]C   q(q2 - q1)    (µ² - 1)pH\r\n    ------- = ---------- = ------------.\r\n       B       q² - q1²    4[pi]µne V0²\r\n\r\n  Thus in transparent bodies for which µ is real, C and B differ in\r\n  phase by [pi]/2, and the reflected light is elliptically polarized,\r\n  the major axis of the ellipse being in the plane of polarization of\r\n  the incident light, so that in this case there is no rotation, but\r\n  only elliptic polarization; when there is strong absorption so that µ\r\n  contains an imaginary term, C/B will contain a real part so that the\r\n  reflected light will be elliptically polarized, but the major axis is\r\n  no longer in the plane of polarization of the incident light; we\r\n  should thus have a rotation of the plane of polarization superposed on\r\n  the elliptic polarization.\r\n\r\n_Zeeman's Effect._--Faraday, after discovering the effect of a magnetic\r\nfield on the plane of polarization of light, made numerous experiments\r\nto see if such a field influenced the nature of the light emitted by a\r\nluminous body, but without success. In 1885 Fievez,[44] a Belgian\r\nphysicist, noticed that the spectrum of a sodium flame was changed\r\nslightly in appearance by a magnetic field; but his observation does not\r\nseem to have attracted much attention, and was probably ascribed to\r\nsecondary effects. In 1896 Zeeman[45] saw a distinct broadening of the\r\nlines of lithium and sodium when the flames containing salts of these\r\nmetals were between the poles of a powerful electromagnet; following up\r\nthis observation, he obtained some exceedingly remarkable and\r\ninteresting results, of which those observed with the blue-green cadmium\r\nline may be taken as typical. He found that in a strong magnetic field,\r\nwhen the lines of force are parallel to the direction of propagation of\r\nthe light, the line is split up into a doublet, the constituents of\r\nwhich are on opposite sides of the undisturbed position of the line, and\r\nthat the light in the constituents of this doublet is circularly\r\npolarized, the rotation in the two lines being in opposite directions.\r\nWhen the magnetic force is at right angles to the direction of\r\npropagation of the light, the line is resolved into a triplet, of which\r\nthe middle line occupies the same position as the undisturbed line; all\r\nthe constituents of this triplet are plane-polarized, the plane of\r\npolarization of the middle line being at right angles to the magnetic\r\nforce, while the outside lines are polarized on a plane parallel to the\r\nlines of magnetic force. A great deal of light is thrown on this\r\nphenomenon by the following considerations due to H. A. Lorentz.[46]\r\n\r\n  Let us consider an ion attracted to a centre of force by a force\r\n  proportional to the distance, and acted on by a magnetic force\r\n  parallel to the axis of z: then if m is the mass of the particle and e\r\n  its charge, the equations of motion are\r\n\r\n      d²x            dy\r\n    m --- + ax = -He --;\r\n      dt²            dt\r\n\r\n      d²y           dx\r\n    m --- + ay = He --;\r\n      dt²           dt\r\n\r\n      d²z\r\n    m --- + ax = 0.\r\n      dt²\r\n\r\n  The solution of these equations is\r\n\r\n    x = A cos (p1t + [beta]) + B cos (p2t + [beta]1)\r\n\r\n    y = A sin (p1t + [beta]) - B sin (p2t + [beta]1)\r\n\r\n    z = C cos (pt + [gamma])\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    a - mp1² = - He p1\r\n\r\n    a - mp2² = He p2\r\n\r\n    p² = [alpha]/m,\r\n\r\n  or approximately\r\n\r\n               He              He\r\n    p1 = p + ½ ---, p2 = p - ½ ---.\r\n                m               m\r\n\r\n  Thus the motion of the ion on the xy plane may be regarded as made up\r\n  of two circular motions in opposite directions described with\r\n  frequencies p1 and p2 respectively, while the motion along z has the\r\n  period p, which is the frequency for all the vibrations when H = 0.\r\n  Now suppose that the cadmium line is due to the motion of such an ion;\r\n  then if the magnetic force is along the direction of propagation, the\r\n  vibration in this direction has its period unaltered, but since the\r\n  direction of vibration is perpendicular to the wave front, it does not\r\n  give rise to light. Thus we are left with the two circular motions in\r\n  the wave front with frequencies p1 and p2 giving the circularly\r\n  polarized constituents of the doublet. Now suppose the magnetic force\r\n  is at right angles to the direction of propagation of the light; then\r\n  the vibration parallel to the magnetic force being in the wave front\r\n  produces luminous effects and gives rise to a plane-polarized ray of\r\n  undisturbed period (the middle line of the triplet), the plane of\r\n  polarization being at right angles to the magnetic force. The\r\n  components in the wave-front of the circular orbits at right angles to\r\n  the magnetic force will be rectilinear motions of frequency p1 and p2\r\n  at right angles to the magnetic force--so that they will produce\r\n  plane-polarized light, the plane of polarization being parallel to the\r\n  magnetic force; these are the outer lines of the triplet.\r\n\r\nIf Zeeman's observations are interpreted from this point of view, the\r\ndirections of rotation of the circularly-polarized light in the doublet\r\nobserved along the lines of magnetic force show that the ions which\r\nproduce the luminous vibrations are _negatively_ electrified, while the\r\nmeasurement of the charge of frequency due to the magnetic field shows\r\nthat e/m is of the order 10^7. This result is of great interest, as this\r\nis the order of the value of e/m in the negatively electrified particles\r\nwhich constitute the Cathode Rays (see CONDUCTION, ELECTRIC III.\r\n_Through Gases_). Thus we infer that the \"cathode particles\" are found\r\nin bodies, even where not subject to the action of intense electrical\r\nfields, and are in fact an ordinary constituent of the molecule. Similar\r\nparticles are found near an incandescent wire, and also near a metal\r\nplate illuminated by ultra-violet light. The value of e/m deduced from\r\nthe Zeeman effect ranges from 10^7 to 3.4 × 10^7, the value of e/m for\r\nthe particle in the cathode rays is 1.7 × 10^7. The majority of the\r\ndeterminations of e/m from the Zeeman effect give numbers larger than\r\nthis, the maximum being about twice this value.\r\n\r\nA more extended study of the behaviour of the spectroscopic lines has\r\nafforded examples in which the effects produced by a magnet are more\r\ncomplicated than those we have described, indeed the simple cases are\r\nmuch less numerous than the more complex. Thus Preston[47] and Cornu[48]\r\nhave shown that under the action of a transverse magnetic field one of\r\nthe D lines splits up into four, and the other into six lines; Preston\r\nhas given many other examples of these quartets and sextets, and has\r\nshown that the change in the frequency, which, according to the simple\r\ntheory indicated, should be the same for all lines, actually varies\r\nconsiderably from one line to another, many lines showing no appreciable\r\ndisplacement. The splitting up of a single line into a quartet or sextet\r\nindicates, from the point of view of the ion theory, that the line must\r\nhave its origin in a system consisting of more than one ion. A single\r\nion having only three degrees of freedom can only have three periods.\r\nWhen there is no magnetic force acting on the ion these periods are\r\nequal, but though under the action of a magnetic force they are\r\nseparated, their number cannot be increased. When therefore we get four\r\nor more lines, the inference is that the system giving the lines must\r\nhave at least four degrees of freedom, and therefore must consist of\r\nmore than one ion. The theory of a system of ions mutually influencing\r\neach other shows, as we should expect, that the effects are more complex\r\nthan in the case of a single ion, and that the change in the frequency\r\nis not necessarily the same for all systems (see J. J. Thomson, _Proc.\r\nCamb. Phil. Soc._ 13, p. 39). Preston[49] and Runge and Paschen have\r\nproved that, in some cases at any rate, the change in the frequency of\r\nthe different lines is of such a character that they can be grouped into\r\nseries such that each line in the series has the same change in\r\nfrequency for the same magnetic force, and, moreover, that homologous\r\nlines in the spectra of different metals belonging to the same group\r\nhave the same change in frequency.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable case of the Zeeman effect has been discovered by H.\r\nBecquerel and Deslandres (_Comptes rendus_, 127, p. 18). They found\r\nlines in iron when the most deflected components are those polarized in\r\nthe plane at right angles to the magnetic force. On the simple theory\r\nthe light polarized in this way is not affected. Thus the behaviour of\r\nthe spectrum in the magnetic field promises to throw great light on the\r\nnature of radiation, and perhaps on the constitution of the elements.\r\nThe study of these effects has been greatly facilitated by the invention\r\nby Michelson[50] of the echelon spectroscope.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting phenomena connected with the Zeeman effect\r\nwhich are more easily observed than the effect itself. Thus Cotton[51]\r\nfound that if we have two Bunsen flames, A and B, coloured by the same\r\nsalt, the absorption of the light of one by the other is diminished if\r\neither is placed between the poles of a magnet: this is at once\r\nexplained by the Zeeman effect, for the times of vibration of the\r\nmolecules of the flame in the magnetic field are not the same as those\r\nof the other flame, and thus the absorption is diminished. Similar\r\nconsiderations explain the phenomenon observed by Egoroff and\r\nGeorgiewsky,[52] that the light emitted from a flame in a transverse\r\nfield is partially polarized in a plane parallel to the magnetic force;\r\nand also Righi's[53] observation that if a sodium flame is placed in a\r\nlongitudinal field between two crossed Nicols, and a ray of white light\r\nsent through one of the Nicols, then through the flame, and then through\r\nthe second Nicol, the amount of light passing through the second Nicol\r\nis greater when the field is on than when it is off. Voight and Wiechert\r\n(_Wied. Ann._ 67, p. 345) detected the double refraction produced when\r\nlight travels through a substance exposed to a magnetic field at right\r\nangles to the path of the light; this result had been predicted by\r\nVoight from theoretical considerations. Jean Becquerel has made some\r\nvery interesting experiments on the effect of a magnetic field on the\r\nfine absorption bands produced by xenotime, a phosphate of yttrium and\r\nerbium, and tysonite, a fluoride of cerium, lanthanum and didymium, and\r\nhas obtained effects which he ascribes to the presence of positive\r\nelectrons. A very complete account of magneto- and electro-optics is\r\ncontained in Voight's _Magneto- and Elektro-optik_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Experimental Researches_, Series 19.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Comptes rendus_, 88, p. 709.\r\n\r\n  [3] _Wied.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNOLIA, the typical genus of the botanical order Magnoliaceae, named\r\nafter Pierre Magnol (1638-1715), professor of medicine and botany at\r\nMontpellier. It contains about twenty species, distributed in Japan,\r\nChina and the Himalayas, as well as in North America.\r\n\r\nMagnolias are trees or shrubs with deciduous or rarely evergreen\r\nfoliage. They bear conspicuous and often large, fragrant, white, rose or\r\npurple flowers. The sepals are three in number, the petals six to\r\ntwelve, in two to four series of three in each, the stamens and carpels\r\nbeing numerous. The fruit consists of a number of follicles which are\r\nborne on a more or less conical receptacle, and dehisce along the outer\r\nedge to allow the scarlet or brown seeds to escape; the seeds however\r\nremain suspended by a long slender thread (the funicle). Of the\r\nold-world species, the earliest in cultivation appears to have been _M.\r\nYulan_ (or _M. conspicua_) of China, of which the buds were preserved,\r\nas well as used medicinally and to season rice; together with the\r\ngreenhouse species, _M. fuscata_, it was transported to Europe in 1789,\r\nand thence to North America, and is now cultivated in the Middle States.\r\nThere are many fine forms of _M. conspicua_, the best being\r\n_Soulangeana_, white tinted with purple, _Lenné_ and _stricta_. Of the\r\nJapanese magnolias, _M. Kobus_ and the purple-flowered _M. obovata_ were\r\nmet with by Kaempfer in 1690, and were introduced into England in 1709\r\nand 1804 respectively. _M. pumila_, the dwarf magnolia, from the\r\nmountains of Amboyna, is nearly evergreen, and bears deliciously scented\r\nflowers; it was introduced in 1786. The Indian species are three in\r\nnumber, _M. globosa_, allied to _M. conspicua_ of Japan, _M.\r\nsphenocarpa_, and, the most magnificent of all magnolias, _M.\r\nCampbellii_, which forms a conspicuous feature in the scenery and\r\nvegetation of Darjeeling. It was discovered by Dr Griffith in Bhutan,\r\nand is a large forest tree, abounding on the outer ranges of Sikkim, 80\r\nto 150 ft. high, and from 6 to 12 ft. in girth. The flowers are 6 to 10\r\nin. across, appearing before the leaves, and vary from white to a deep\r\nrose colour.\r\n\r\nThe first of the American species brought to Europe (in 1688 by John\r\nBanister) was _M. glauca_, a beautiful evergreen species about 15 ft.\r\nhigh with obtuse leathery leaves, blue-green above, silvery underneath,\r\nand globular flowers varying from creamy white to pale yellow with age.\r\nIt is found in low situations near the sea from Massachusetts to\r\nLouisiana--more especially in New Jersey and the Carolinas. _M.\r\nacuminata_, the so-called \"cucumber tree,\" from the resemblance of the\r\nyoung fruits to small cucumbers, ranges from Pennsylvania to Carolina.\r\nThe wood is yellow, and used for bowls; the flowers, 3 to 4 in. across,\r\nare glaucous green tinted with yellow. It was introduced into England\r\nfrom Virginia about 1736. _M. tripetala_ (or _M. umbrella_), is known as\r\nthe \"umbrella tree\" from the arrangement of the leaves at the ends of\r\nthe branches resembling somewhat that of the ribs of an umbrella. The\r\nflowers, 5 to 8 in. across, are white and have a strong but not\r\ndisagreeable scent. It was brought to England in 1752. _M. Fraseri_ (or\r\n_M. auriculata_), discovered by John Bartram in 1773, is a native of the\r\nwestern parts of the Carolinas and Georgia, extending southward to\r\nwestern Florida and southern Alabama. It grows 30 to 50 ft. high, has\r\nleaves a foot or more long, heart-shaped and bluntly auricled at the\r\nbase, and fragrant pale yellowish-white flowers, 3 to 4 in. across. The\r\nmost beautiful species of North America is _M. grandiflora_, the \"laurel\r\nmagnolia,\" a native of the south-eastern States, and introduced into\r\nEngland in 1734. It grows a straight trunk, 2 ft. in diameter and\r\nupwards of 70 ft. high, bearing a profusion of large, powerfully\r\nlemon-scented creamy-white flowers. It is an evergreen tree, easily\r\nrecognized by its glossy green oval oblong leaves with a rusty-brown\r\nunder surface. In England it is customary to train it against a wall in\r\nthe colder parts, but it does well as a bush tree; and the original\r\nspecies is surpassed by the Exmouth varieties, which originated as\r\nseedlings at Exeter from the tree first raised in England by Sir John\r\nColliton, and which flower much more freely than the parent plant. Other\r\nfine magnolias now to be met with in gardens are _M. cordata_, a North\r\nAmerican deciduous tree 40 to 50 ft. high, with heart-shaped leaves,\r\nwoolly beneath, and yellow flowers lined with purple; _M. hypoleuca_, a\r\nfine Japanese tree 60 ft. high or more, with leaves a foot or more long,\r\n6 to 7 in. broad, the under surface covered with hairs; _M.\r\nmacrophylla_, a handsome deciduous North American tree, with smooth\r\nwhitish bark, and very large beautiful green leaves, 1 to 3 ft. long, 8\r\nto 10 in. broad, oblong-obovate and heart-shaped at the base; the open\r\nsweet-scented bell-shaped flowers 8 to 10 in. across, are white with a\r\npurple blotch at the base of the petals; _M. stellata_ or _Halleana_, a\r\ncharming deciduous Japanese shrub remarkable for producing its pure\r\nwhite starry flowers as early as February and March on the leafless\r\nstems; and _M. Watsoni_, another fine deciduous Japanese bush or small\r\ntree with very fragrant pure white flowers 5 to 6 in. across.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Magnolia grandiflora_, shoot with flower; rather less\r\nthan ½ nat. size.\r\n\r\n  1.

Fruit--the ripe carpels are splitting, exposing the seeds, some of\r\n  which are suspended by the long funicle.\r\n\r\n  3. Floral diagram, b, bract.]\r\n\r\nThe tulip tree, _Liriodendron tulipifera_, a native of North America,\r\nfrequently cultivated in England, is also a member of the same family.\r\nIt reaches a height of over 100 ft. in a native condition, and as much\r\nas 60 to 80 ft. in England. It resembles the plane tree somewhat in\r\nappearance, but is readily recognized by lobed leaves having the apical\r\nlobe truncated, and by its soft green and yellow tulip-like\r\nflowers--which however are rarely borne on trees under twenty years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\n  For a description of the principal species of magnolia under\r\n  cultivation see J. Weathers, _Practical Guide to Garden Plants_, pp.\r\n  174 seq., and for a detailed account of the American species see C. S.\r\n  Sargent, _Silva of North America_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNUS, HEINRICH GUSTAV (1802-1870), German chemist and physicist, was\r\nborn at Berlin on the 2nd of May 1802. His father was a wealthy\r\nmerchant; and of his five brothers one, Eduard (1799-1872), became a\r\ncelebrated painter. After studying at Berlin, he went to Stockholm to\r\nwork under Berzelius, and later to Paris, where he studied for a while\r\nunder Gay-Lussac and Thénard. In 1831 he returned to Berlin as lecturer\r\non technology and physics at the university. As a teacher his success\r\nwas rapid and extraordinary. His lucid style and the perfection of his\r\nexperimental demonstrations drew to his lectures a crowd of enthusiastic\r\nscholars, on whom he impressed the importance of applied science by\r\nconducting them round the factories and workshops of the city; and he\r\nfurther found time to hold weekly \"colloquies\" on physical questions at\r\nhis house with a small circle of young students. From 1827 to 1833 he\r\nwas occupied mainly with chemical researches, which resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of the first of the platino-ammonium compounds (\"Magnus's\r\ngreen salt\" is PtCl2, 2NH3), of sulphovinic, ethionic and isethionic\r\nacids and their salts, and, in conjunction with C. F. Ammermüller, of\r\nperiodic acid. Among other subjects at which he subsequently worked were\r\nthe absorption of gases in blood (1837-1845), the expansion of gases by\r\nheat (1841-1844), the vapour pressures of water and various solutions\r\n(1844-1854), thermo-electricity (1851), electrolysis (1856), induction\r\nof currents (1858-1861), conduction of heat in gases (1860), and\r\npolarization of heat (1866-1868). From 1861 onwards he devoted much\r\nattention to the question of diathermancy in gases and vapours,\r\nespecially to the behaviour in this respect of dry and moist air, and to\r\nthe thermal effects produced by the condensation of moisture on solid\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Magnus was elected extraordinary, and in 1845 ordinary professor\r\nat Berlin. He was three times elected dean of the faculty, in 1847, 1858\r\nand 1863; and in 1861, rector magnificus. His great reputation led to\r\nhis being entrusted by the government with several missions; in 1865 he\r\nrepresented Prussia in the conference called at Frankfort to introduce a\r\nuniform metric system of weights and measures into Germany. For\r\nforty-five years his labour was incessant; his first memoir was\r\npublished in 1825 when he was yet a student; his last appeared shortly\r\nafter his death on the 4th of April 1870. He married in 1840 Bertha\r\nHumblot, of a French Huguenot family settled in Berlin, by whom he left\r\na son and two daughters.\r\n\r\n  See _Allgemeine deutsche Biog._ The Royal Society's _Catalogue_\r\n  enumerates 84 papers by Magnus, most of which originally appeared in\r\n  _Poggendorff's Annalen_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNY, CLAUDE DRIGON, MARQUIS DE (1797-1879), French heraldic writer,\r\nwas born in Paris. After being employed for some time in the postal\r\nservice, he devoted himself to the study of heraldry and genealogy, his\r\nwork in this direction being rewarded by Pope Gregory XVI. with a\r\nmarquisate. He founded a French college of heraldry, and wrote several\r\nworks on heraldry and genealogy, of which the most important were\r\n_Archives nobiliaires universelles_ (1843) and _Livre d'or de la\r\nnoblesse de France_ (1844-1852). His two sons, Edouard Drigon and\r\nAchille Ludovice Drigon, respectively comte and vicomte de Magny, also\r\nwrote several works on heraldry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGO, the name of several Carthaginians, (1) The reputed founder of the\r\nmilitary power of Carthage, fl. 550-500 B.C. (Justin xviii. 7, xix. i).\r\n(2) The youngest of the three sons of Hamilcar Barca. He accompanied\r\nHannibal into Italy, and held important commands in the great victories\r\nof the first three years. After the battle of Cannae (216 B.C.) he\r\nsailed to Carthage to report the successes gained. He was about to\r\nreturn to Italy with strong reinforcements for Hannibal, when the\r\ngovernment ordered him to go to the aid of his other brother, Hasdrubal,\r\nwho was hard pressed in Spain. He carried on the war there with varying\r\nsuccess in concert with the two Hasdrubals until, in 209, his brother\r\nmarched into Italy to help Hannibal. Mago remained in Spain with\r\nHasdrubal, the son of Gisco. In 207 he was defeated by M. Junius\r\nSilanus, and in 206 the combined forces of Mago and Hasdrubal were\r\nscattered by Scipio Africanus in the decisive battle of Silpia. Mago\r\nmaintained himself for some time in Gades, but afterwards received\r\norders to carry the war into Liguria. He wintered in the Balearic Isles,\r\nwhere the harbour Portus Magonis (Port Mahon) still bears his name.\r\nEarly in 204 he landed in Liguria, where he maintained a desultory\r\nwarfare till in 203 he was defeated in Cisalpine Gaul by the Roman\r\nforces. Shortly afterwards he was ordered to return to Carthage, but on\r\nthe voyage home he died of wounds received in battle.\r\n\r\n  See Polybius iii.; Livy xxi.-xxiii.; xxviii., chs. 23-37; xxix., xxx.;\r\n  Appian, _Hispanica_, 25-37; T. Friedrich, _Biographie des Barkiden\r\n  Mago_; H. Lehmann, _Der Angriff der drei Barkiden auf Italien_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1905); and further J. P. Mahaffy, in _Hermathena_, vii.\r\n  29-36 (1890).\r\n\r\n(3) The name of Mago is also attached to a great work on agriculture\r\nwhich was brought to Rome and translated by order of the senate after\r\nthe destruction of Carthage. The book was regarded as a standard\r\nauthority, and is often referred to by later writers.\r\n\r\n  See Pliny, _Nat. Hist_, xviii. 5; Columella, i. 1; Cicero, _De\r\n  oratore_, i. 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGPIE, or simply PIE (Fr. _pie_), the prefix being the abbreviated form\r\nof a human name (Margaret[1]), a bird once common throughout Great\r\nBritain, though now nearly everywhere scarce. Its pilfering habits have\r\nled to this result, yet the injuries it causes are exaggerated by common\r\nreport; and in many countries of Europe it is still the tolerated or\r\neven the cherished neighbour of every farmer, as it formerly was in\r\nEngland if not in Scotland also. It did not exist in Ireland in 1617,\r\nwhen Fynes Morison wrote his _Itinerary_, but it had appeared there\r\nwithin a hundred years later, when Swift mentions its occurrences in his\r\n_Journal to Stella_, 9th July 1711. It is now common enough in that\r\ncountry, and there is a widespread but unfounded belief that it was\r\nintroduced by the English out of spite. It is a species that when not\r\nmolested is extending its range, as J. Wolley ascertained in Lapland,\r\nwhere within the last century it has been gradually pushing its way\r\nalong the coast and into the interior from one fishing-station or\r\nsettler's house to the next, as the country has been peopled.\r\n\r\nSince the persecution to which the pie has been subjected in Great\r\nBritain, its habits have altered greatly. It is no longer the merry,\r\nsaucy hanger-on of the homestead, but is become the suspicious thief,\r\nshunning the gaze of man, and knowing that danger may lurk in every\r\nbush. Hence opportunities of observing it fall to the lot of few, and\r\nmost persons know it only as a curtailed captive in a wicker cage, where\r\nits vivacity and natural beauty are lessened or wholly lost. At large\r\nfew European birds possess greater beauty, the pure white of its\r\nscapulars and inner web of the flight-feathers contrasting vividly with\r\nthe deep glossy black on the rest of its body and wings, while its long\r\ntail is lustrous with green, bronze, and purple reflections. The pie's\r\nnest is a wonderfully ingenious structure, placed either in high trees\r\nor low bushes, and so massively built that it will stand for years. Its\r\nfoundation consists of stout sticks, turf and clay, wrought into a deep,\r\nhollow cup, plastered with earth, and lined with fibres; but around this\r\nis erected a firmly interwoven, basket-like outwork of thorny sticks,\r\nforming a dome over the nest, and leaving but a single hole in the side\r\nfor entrance and exit, so that the whole structure is rendered almost\r\nimpregnable. Herein are laid from six to nine eggs, of a pale\r\nbluish-green freckled with brown and blotched with ash-colour.\r\nSuperstition as to the appearance of the pie still survives even among\r\nmany educated persons, and there are several versions of a rhyming adage\r\nas to the various turns of luck which its presenting itself, either\r\nalone or in company with others, is supposed to betoken, though all\r\nagree that the sight of a single pie presages sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe pie belongs to the same family of birds as the crow, and is the\r\n_Corvus pica_ of Linnaeus, the _Pica caudata_, _P. melanoleuca_, or _P.\r\nrustica_ of modern ornithologists, who have recognized it as forming a\r\ndistinct genus, but the number of species thereto belonging has been a\r\nfruitful source of discussion. Examples from the south of Spain differ\r\nslightly from those inhabiting the rest of Europe, and in some points\r\nmore resemble the _P. mauritanica_ of north-western Africa; but that\r\nspecies has a patch of bare skin of a fine blue colour behind the eye,\r\nand much shorter wings. No fewer than five species have been\r\ndiscriminated from various parts of Asia, extending to Japan; but only\r\none of them, the _P. leucoptera_ of Turkestan and Tibet, has of late\r\nbeen admitted as valid. In the west of North America, and in some of its\r\nislands, a pie is found which extends to the upper valleys of the\r\nMissouri and the Yellowstone, and has long been thought entitled to\r\nspecific distinction as _P. hudsonia_; but its claim thereto is now\r\ndisallowed by some of the best ornithologists of the United States, and\r\nit can hardly be deemed even a geographical variety of the Old-World\r\nform. In California, however, there is a permanent race if not a good\r\nspecies, _P. nuttalli_, easily distinguishable by its yellow bill and\r\nthe bare yellow skin round its eyes; on two occasions in the year 1867 a\r\nbird apparently similar was observed in Great Britain (_Zoologist_, ser.\r\n2, pp. 706, 1016).     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] \"Magot\" and \"Madge,\" with the same origin, are names, frequently\r\n    given in England to the pie; while in France it is commonly known as\r\n    _Margot_, if not termed, as it is in some districts, _Jaquette_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGWE, a district in the Minbu division of Upper Burma. Area, 2913 sq.\r\nm.; pop. (1901), 246,708, showing an increase of 12.38% in the decade.\r\nMagwe may be divided into two portions: the low, flat country in the\r\nTaungdwingyi subdivision, and the undulating high ground extending over\r\nthe rest of the district. In Taungdwingyi the soil is rich, loamy, and\r\nextremely fertile. The plain is about 45 m. from north to south. At its\r\nsouthern extremity it is about 30 m. wide, and lessens in width to the\r\nnorth till it ends in a point at Natmauk. On the east are the Pegu\r\nYomas, which at some points reach a height of 1500 ft. A number of\r\nstreams run westwards to the Irrawaddy, of which the Yin and the Pin,\r\nwhich form the northern boundary, are the chief. The only perennial\r\nstream is the Yanpè. Rice is the staple product, and considerable\r\nquantities are exported. Sesamum of very high quality, maize, and millet\r\nare also cultivated, as well as cotton in patches here and there over\r\nthe whole district.\r\n\r\n  In this district are included the well-known Yenangyaung petroleum\r\n  wells. The state wells have been leased to the Burma Oil Company. The\r\n  amount of oil-bearing lands is estimated at 80 sq. m. and the portion\r\n  not leased to the company has been demarcated into blocks of 1 sq. m.\r\n  and offered on lease. The remaining land belongs to hereditary Burmese\r\n  owners called _twinsa_, who dig wells and extract their oil by the\r\n  rope and pulley system as they have always done. Lacquered wood trays,\r\n  bowls and platters, and cart-wheels, are the only manufactures of any\r\n  note in the district.\r\n\r\n  The annual rainfall averages about 27 inches. The maximum temperature\r\n  rises to a little over 100° in the hot season, and falls to an average\r\n  minimum of 53° and 54° in the cold season.\r\n\r\n  The town of Magwe is the headquarters of the district; pop. (1901),\r\n  6232. It is diagonally opposite Minbu, the headquarters of the\r\n  division, on the right bank of the Irrawaddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGYARS, the name of the dominant race in Hungary, or Hungarians proper.\r\nThough they have become physically assimilated to the western peoples,\r\nthey belong in origin and language to the Finno-Ugrian (q.v.) division\r\nof the Ural-Altaic race. They form barely half of the population of\r\nHungary, but are by far the largest and most compact of all its racial\r\ngroups. Magyar is the official language of Hungary, the official name of\r\nwhich (_Magyarorzág_, or \"country of the Magyars\") enshrines the Magyar\r\nclaim to predominance. While all Magyars are properly Hungarians, all\r\nHungarians are not necessarily Magyars. \"Hungarian\" may be used as a\r\ngeneric term covering all the various races of Hungary, while \"Magyar\"\r\nis strictly specific to a single group. The Magyars themselves, indeed,\r\nsometimes apply the name _Magyarorzág_ to Hungary \"proper,\" excluding\r\nCroatia-Slavonia, the whole kingdom being called _Magyarbirodalom_, the\r\nMagyar monarchy or realm. See HUNGARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHABALESHWAR, or MALCOLMPETH, a hill station in Satara district, and\r\nthe principal sanatorium in the Bombay presidency, India. Pop. (1901),\r\n5299. It is reached by carriage from Wathar railway station (39 m.) or\r\nby motor car from Poona (119 m.). Mahabaleshwar occupies the summit of a\r\nridge of the Western Ghats, with a general elevation of 4500 ft. above\r\nsea-level. It was established in 1828 by Sir John Malcolm, governor of\r\nBombay, who obtained the site from the raja of Satara in exchange for\r\nanother patch of territory. The superior elevation of Mahabaleshwar\r\nrenders it much cooler than Matheran (2460 ft.), a sanatorium about 50\r\nm. E. of Bombay, but its heavy rainfall (292 in. annual average) makes\r\nit almost uninhabitable during the rainy season. The mean annual\r\ntemperature is 67° F. In the hottest season (March-April) an extreme of\r\na little over 90° is reached during the day. Mahabaleshwar forms the\r\nretreat usually during spring, and occasionally in autumn, of the\r\ngovernor of Bombay, and the chief officers of his establishment, and has\r\nthe usual public buildings of a first-class sanatorium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHAFFY, JOHN PENTLAND (1839-   ), Irish classical scholar, was born in\r\nSwitzerland on the 12th of July 1839. He received his early education in\r\nSwitzerland and Germany, and later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he\r\nheld the professorship of ancient history. Mahaffy, a man of great\r\nversatility, published numerous works, some of which, especially those\r\ndealing with what may be called the Silver age of Greece, became\r\nstandard authorities. The following deserve mention: _History of\r\nClassical Greek Literature_ (4th ed., 1903 seq.); _Social Life in Greece\r\nfrom Homer to Menander_ (4th ed., 1903); _The Silver Age of the Greek\r\nWorld_ (1906); _The Empire of the Ptolemies_ (1896); _Greek Life and\r\nThought from Alexander to the Roman Conquest_ (2nd ed., 1896); _The\r\nGreek World under Roman Sway from Polybius to Plutarch_ (1890). His\r\ntranslation of Kuno Fischer's _Commentary on Kant_ (1866) and his own\r\nexhaustive analysis, with elucidations, of Kant's critical philosophy\r\nare of great value. He also edited the Petrie papyri in the _Cunningham\r\nMemoirs_ (3 vols. 1891-1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHALLAT, a province of central Persia, situated between Kashan and\r\nIrak. Pop. about 20,000; yearly revenue about £2500. Until 1890 it was\r\none of the five \"central provinces\" (the other four being Irak, Ferahan,\r\nKezzaz, and Savah), which were under a governor appointed by the shah;\r\nsince then it has formed part of the Isfahan government. It is traversed\r\nby the Anarbar or Kum River, and comprises the city of Mahallat, divided\r\ninto upper and lower, or Rivkan and Zanjirvan, and twenty-two\r\nflourishing villages. It was known in former times as Anar, the Anarus\r\nof Peutinger's tables. The city, capital of the province, is situated at\r\nan elevation of 5850 ft. in 33° 51´ N., 50° 30´ E.; pop. about 9000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHAN, ALFRED THAYER (1840-   ), American naval officer and historian,\r\nwas born on the 27th of September 1840 at West Point, New York. His\r\nfather, Dennis Hart Mahan (1802-1871) was a professor in the military\r\nacademy, and the author of textbooks on civil and military engineering.\r\nThe son graduated at the naval academy in 1859, became lieutenant in\r\n1861, served on the \"Congress,\" and on the \"Pocahontas,\" \"Seminole,\" and\r\n\"James Adger\" during the Civil War, and was instructor at the naval\r\nacademy for a year. In 1865 he was made lieut.-commander, commander in\r\n1872, captain in 1885. Meanwhile he saw service in the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nthe South Atlantic, the Pacific, and Asia, and did shore duty at Boston,\r\nNew York and Annapolis. In 1886-89 he was president of the naval war\r\ncollege at Newport, Rhode Island. Between 1889 and 1892 he was engaged\r\nin special service for the bureau of navigation, and in 1893 was made\r\ncommander of the \"Chicago,\" of the European squadron. In 1896 he retired\r\nfrom active service, but was a member of the naval board of strategy\r\nduring the war between the United States and Spain. He was a member of\r\nthe peace congress at the Hague in 1899. This long and varied service\r\ngave him extensive opportunities for observation, which he supplemented\r\nby constant study of naval authorities and reflection on the\r\ninterpretation of the problems of maritime history. His first book was a\r\nmodest and compact story of the affairs in _The Gulf and Inland Waters_\r\n(1883), in a series of volumes by various writers, entitled _The Navy in\r\nthe Civil War_; in 1890 he suddenly acquired fame by the appearance of\r\nhis masterly work entitled _The Influence of Sea Power upon History,\r\n1660-1783_. Having been impressed by the failure of historians to allow\r\nfor the influence of sea power in struggles between nations, he was led\r\nto make prolonged investigations of this general theme (see SEA POWER).\r\nThe reception accorded the volume was instant and hearty; in England, in\r\nparticular, it was deemed almost an epoch-making work, and was studied\r\nby naval specialists, cabinet ministers and journalists, as well as by a\r\nlarge part of the general public. It was followed by _The Influence of\r\nSea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire_ (2 vols. 1892); _The\r\nLife of Nelson, the Embodiment of the Sea Power of Great Britain_\r\n(1897); and _Sea Power in its Relations to the War of 1812_ (1905). The\r\nauthor's general aim in these works--some of which have been translated\r\ninto French, German and Japanese--was to make the consideration of\r\nmaritime matters paramount to that of military, political or economic\r\nmovements, without, however, as he himself says \"divorcing them from\r\ntheir surroundings of cause and effect in general history, but seeking\r\nto show how they modified the latter, and were modified by them.\" He\r\nselected the year 1660 as the beginning of his narrative, as being the\r\ndate when the \"sailing-ship era, with its distinctive features, had\r\nfairly begun.\" The series as a whole has been accepted as finally\r\nauthoritative, supplanting its predecessors of similar aim, and\r\nalmost--in the words of Theodore Roosevelt--founding a new school of\r\nnaval historical writing.\r\n\r\n  Other works by Mahan are a _Life of Admiral Farragut_ (1892); _The\r\n  Interest of America in Sea Power_ (1897); _Lessons of the War with\r\n  Spain_ (1899); _The Story of the War with South Africa_ and _The\r\n  Problem of Asia_ (1900); _Types of Naval Officers drawn from the\r\n  History of the British Navy_ (1901); _Retrospect and Prospect_,\r\n  studies of international relations (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHANADI, or MAHANUDDY (\"The Great River\"), a river of India. It rises\r\nin 20° 10´ N., 82° E., 25 m. S. of Raipur town, in the wild mountains of\r\nBastar in the Central Provinces. At first an insignificant stream,\r\ntaking a northerly direction, it drains the eastern portion of the\r\nChhattisgarh plain, then a little above Seorinarayan it receives the\r\nwaters which its first great affluent, the Seonath, has collected from\r\nthe western portion of the plain; thence flowing for some distance due\r\nE., its stream is augmented by the drainage of the hills of Uprora,\r\nKorba, and the ranges that separate Sambalpur from Chota Nagpur. At\r\nPadampur it turns towards the south, and struggling through masses of\r\nrock, flows past the town of Sambalpur to Sonpur. From Sonpur it pursues\r\na tortuous course among ridges and rocky crags towards the range of the\r\nEastern Ghats. This mountain line it pierces by a gorge about 40 m. in\r\nlength, overlooked by forest-clad hills. Since the opening of the\r\nBengal-Nagpur railway, the Mahanadi is little used for navigation. It\r\npours down upon the Orissa delta at Naraj, about 7 m. west of Cuttack\r\ntown; and after traversing Cuttack district from west to east, and\r\nthrowing off numerous branches (the Katjori, Paika, Biropa, Chitartala,\r\n&c.) it falls into the Bay of Bengal at False Point by several channels.\r\n\r\n  The Mahanadi has an estimated drainage area of 43,800 sq. m., and its\r\n  rapid flow renders its maximum discharge in time of flood second to\r\n  that of no other river in India. During unusually high floods\r\n  1,500,000 cub. ft. of water pour every second through the Naraj gorge,\r\n  one-half of which, uncontrolled by the elaborate embankments, and\r\n  heavily laden with silt, pours over the delta, filling the swamps,\r\n  inundating the rice-fields, and converting the plains into a sea. In\r\n  the dry weather the discharge of the Mahanadi dwindles to 1125 cub.\r\n  ft. per second. Efforts have been made to husband and utilize the vast\r\n  water supply thrown upon the Orissa delta during seasons of flood.\r\n  Each of the three branches into which the parent stream splits at the\r\n  delta head is regulated by a weir. Of the four canals which form the\r\n  Orissa irrigation system, two take off from the Biropa weir, and one,\r\n  with its branch, from the Mahanadi weir. On the 31st of December 1868\r\n  the government took over the whole canal works from the East Indian\r\n  Irrigation Company, at a cost of £941,368. The canals thus taken over\r\n  and since completed, are the high-level canal, the Kendrapara canal,\r\n  the Taldanda canal and the Machgaon canal, irrigating 275,000 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHANOY CITY, a borough of Schuylkill county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., 56\r\nm. N.E. of Harrisburg. Pop. (1890), 11,286; (1900), 13,504, of whom 3877\r\nwere foreign-born, mostly Slavs; (1910 census) 15,936. It is served by\r\nbranches of the Lehigh Valley and the Philadelphia & Reading railways.\r\nThe borough is situated in the valley of Mahanoy Creek, and has an\r\nelevation of 1240 ft. above the sea; Broad Mountain (1795 ft.), a ridge\r\nextending through Schuylkill county, overlooks it on the S.E. The valley\r\nis a part of the anthracite coal region of Pennsylvania, fire clay\r\nabounds in the vicinity, and the borough's principal industries are the\r\nmining and shipping of coal, and the manufacture of shirts and foundry\r\nproducts. Mahanoy City, originally a part of Mahanoy township (pop. in\r\n1910, 6256), was incorporated as a borough in 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHAR, the name of a servile caste in the Deccan, India. Their special\r\nfunction, apart from that of scavenger, is to act as village watchman,\r\nas guardian of the village boundaries, and as public messenger. In some\r\nparts they are also weavers of coarse cotton cloth. In 1901 their total\r\nnumber in all India was just under three millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHARAJPUR, a village in Gwalior state, Central India. Pop. (1901), 366.\r\nIt was the scene of a battle (Dec. 29, 1843) in which Sir Hugh Gough,\r\naccompanied by the governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, defeated the\r\ninsurgent army of the Gwalior state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHAVAMSA, the _Great Chronicle_, a history of Ceylon from the 5th\r\ncentury B.C. to the middle of the 5th century A.D., written in Pali\r\nverse by Mahanama of the Dighasanda Hermitage, shortly after the close\r\nof the period with which it deals. In point of historical value it\r\ncompares well with early European chronicles. In India proper the\r\ndecipherment of early Indian inscriptions was facilitated to a very\r\ngreat extent by the data found only in the Mahavamsa. It was composed on\r\nthe basis of earlier works written in Sinhalese, which are now lost,\r\nhaving been supplanted by the chronicles and commentaries in which their\r\ncontents were restated in Pali in the course of the 5th century. The\r\nparticular one on which our Mahavamsa was mainly based was also called\r\nthe Mahavamsa, and was written in Sinhalese prose with Pali memorial\r\nverse interspersed. The extant Pali work gives legends of the Buddha and\r\nthe genealogy of his family; a sketch of the history of India down to\r\nAsoka; an account of Buddhism in India down to the same date; a\r\ndescription of the sending out of missionaries after Asoka's council,\r\nand especially of the mission of Mahinda to Ceylon; a sketch of the\r\nprevious history of Ceylon; a long account of the reign of Devanam-piya\r\nTissa, the king of Ceylon who received Mahinda, and established Buddhism\r\nin the island; short accounts of the kings succeeding him down to Duttha\r\nGamiin (Dadagamana or Dutegemunu); then a long account, amounting to an\r\nepic poem, of the adventures and reign of that prince, a popular hero,\r\nborn in adversity, who roused the people, and drove the Tamil invaders\r\nout of the island. Finally we have short notices of the subsequent kings\r\ndown to the author's time. The Mahavamsa was the first Pali book made\r\nknown to Europe. It was edited in 1837, with English translation and an\r\nelaborate introduction, by George Turnour, then colonial secretary in\r\nCeylon. Its vocabulary was an important part of the material utilized in\r\nChilder's _Pali Dictionary_. Its relation to the sources from which it\r\ndrew has been carefully discussed by various scholars and in especial\r\ndetail by Geiger. It is agreed that it gives a reasonably fair and\r\ncorrect presentation of the tradition preserved in the lost Sinhalese\r\nMahavamsa; that, except in the earliest period, its list of kings, with\r\nthe years of each reign, is complete and trustworthy; and that it gives\r\nthroughout the view, as to events in Ceylon, of a resident in the Great\r\nMinster at Anuradhapura.\r\n\r\n  See _The Mahavamsa_, ed. by Geo. Turnour (Colombo, 1837); ed. by W.\r\n  Geiger (London, 1908); H. Oldenberg, in the introduction to his\r\n  edition of the _Dipavamsa_ (London, 1879); O. Franke, in _Wiener\r\n  Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes_ (1907); W. Geiger,\r\n  _Dipavamsa und Mahavamsa_ (Leipzig, 1905, trans. by Ethel M.\r\n  Coomaraswamy, Colombo, 1908).     (T. W. R. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHAYANA (\"Great Vehicle\"), the name given to the later Buddhism, the\r\npopular religion which embraced all the people and had its pantheon of\r\nBuddhas and Bodhisatvas, with attendant deities and demons, spacious\r\ntemples and images, pompous ceremonial and noisy festivals. It was thus\r\ncontrasted with the Hinayana (\"Little Vehicle\") of the primitive\r\nBuddhism which had been only for the select few. (See BUDDHISM.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHDI (Arab. \"he who is guided aright\"), a title assumed by the third\r\nAbbasid caliph (see CALIPHATE: _Abbasids_, § 3). According to Moslem\r\ntraditionists Mahomet declared that one of his descendants, the imam of\r\nGod, who would fill the earth with equity and justice, would bear the\r\nname of al-mahdi. The Sunnis hold that this mahdi has not yet appeared.\r\nThe name of mahdi is also given by the Shi'ite Mahommedans to the last\r\nof the imams of the house of 'Ali. It was under the name of al-mahdi\r\nthat Mokhtar proclaimed 'Ali's son Mahommed as the opponent of the\r\ncaliph Abdalmalik, and, according to Shahrastani, the doctrine of the\r\nmahdi, the hidden deliverer who is one day to appear and fill the\r\noppressed world with righteousness, first arose in connexion with a\r\nbelief that this Mahommed had not died but lived concealed at Mount\r\nRadwa, near Mecca, guarded by a lion and a panther. The hidden imam of\r\nthe common Shi'ites is, however, the twelfth imam, Mahommed Abu'I-Qasim,\r\nwho disappeared mysteriously in 879. The belief in the appearance of the\r\nmahdi readily lent itself to imposture. Of the many pretenders to this\r\ndignity known in all periods of Moslem history the most famous was the\r\nfirst caliph of the Fatimite dynasty in North Africa, 'Obaidallah\r\nal-Mahdi, who reigned 909-933. After him was named the first capital of\r\nthe dynasty, the once important city of Mahdia (q.v.). Another great\r\nhistorical movement, headed by a leader who proclaimed himself the mahdi\r\n(Mahommed ibn Abdallah ibn Tumart), was that of the Almohades (q.v.). In\r\n1881 Mahommed Ahmed ibn Seyyid Abdullah (q.v.), a Dongolese, proclaimed\r\nhimself al-mahdi and founded in the eastern Sudan the short-lived empire\r\noverthrown by an Anglo-Egyptian force at the battle of Omdurman in 1898.\r\nConcurrently with the claim of Mahommed Ahmed to be the mahdi the same\r\ntitle was claimed by, or for, the head of the Senussites, a\r\nconfraternity powerful in many regions of North Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHDIA (also spelt _Mehdia_, _Mehedia_, &c.), a town of Tunisia, on the\r\ncoast between the gulfs of Hammamet and Gabes, 47 m. by rail S.S.E. of\r\nSusa. Pop. about 8000. Mahdia is built on a rocky peninsula which\r\nprojects eastward about a mile beyond the normal coast line, and is not\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile wide. The extremity of the peninsula is\r\ncalled Ras Mahdia or Cape Africa--Africa being the name by which Mahdia\r\nwas designated by Froissart and other European historians during the\r\nmiddle ages and the Renaissance. In the centre of the peninsula and\r\noccupying its highest point is a citadel (16th century); another castle\r\nfarther west is now used as a prison and is in the centre of the native\r\ntown. The European quarter and the new port are on the south-west side\r\nof the peninsula. The port is available for small boats only; steamers\r\nanchor in the roadstead about a quarter of a mile from the shore. On the\r\nsouth-east, cut out of the rock, is the ancient harbour, or _cothon_,\r\nmeasuring about 480 ft by 240 ft., the entrance being 42 ft. wide. There\r\nare manufactories of olive oil, but the chief industry is sardine\r\nfishing, largely in the hands of Italians.\r\n\r\nMahdia occupies the site of a Phoenician settlement and by some\r\nauthorities is identified with the town called Turris Hannibalis by the\r\nRomans. Hannibal is said to have embarked here on his exile from\r\nCarthage. After the Arab conquest of North Africa the town fell into\r\ndecay. It was refounded in 912 by the first Fatimite caliph,\r\n'Obaidallah-al-Mahdi, after whom it was named. It became the port of\r\nKairawan and was for centuries a city of considerable importance,\r\nlargely owing to its great natural strength, and its position on the\r\nMediterranean. It carried on an active trade with Egypt, Syria and\r\nSpain. The town was occupied by the Normans of Sicily in the 12th\r\ncentury, but after holding it for about twelve years they were driven\r\nout in 1159 by the Almohades. In 1390 a joint English and French force\r\nvainly besieged Mahdia for sixty-one days. In the early part of the 16th\r\ncentury the corsair Dragut seized the town and made it his capital, but\r\nin 1550 the place was captured by the Spaniards, who held it until 1574.\r\nBefore evacuating the town the Spaniards dismantled the fortifications.\r\nUnder the rule of the Turks and, later, the beys of Tunis Mahdia became\r\na place of little importance. It was occupied by the French in 1881\r\nwithout opposition, and regained some of its former commercial\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n  During 1908 numbers of bronzes and other works of art were recovered\r\n  from a vessel wrecked off Mahdia in the 5th century A.D. (see\r\n  _Classical Review_, June 1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHÉ, a French settlement in the Malabar district of Madras, India,\r\nsituated in 11° 43´ N. and 75° 33´ E., at the mouth of a river of the\r\nsame name. Area, 26 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 10,298. It is the only French\r\npossession on the west coast of India, and is in charge of a _chef de\r\nservice_, subordinate to the governor-general at Pondicherry. It is now\r\na decaying place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHESHWAR, a town in Indore state, Central India, on the N. bank of the\r\nNarbada (Nerbudda). Pop. (1901), 7042. Though of great antiquity and\r\nalso of religious sanctity, it is chiefly noted as the residence of\r\nAhalya Bai, the reigning queen of the Holkar dynasty during the last\r\nhalf of the 18th century, whose ability and munificence are famous\r\nthroughout India. Close by her cenotaph stands the family temple of the\r\nHolkars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHI, a river of western India, which rises in Central India and, after\r\nflowing through south Rajputana, enters Gujarat and falls into the sea\r\nby a wide estuary near Cambay; total length, 300 m.; estimated drainage\r\narea, 16,000 sq. m. It has given its name to the Mahi Kantha agency of\r\nBombay, and also to the mehwasis, marauding highlanders often mentioned\r\nin Mahommedan chronicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHI KANTHA, a political agency or collection of native states in India,\r\nwithin the Gujarat division of Bombay. Over half the territory is\r\ncovered by the native state of Idar. There are eleven other chiefships,\r\nand a large number of estates belonging to Rajput or Koli thakurs,\r\nformerly feudatories of Baroda. Several of the states are under British\r\nadministration. Total area, 3125 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 361,545, showing a\r\ndecrease of 38% in the decade, due to famine; estimated revenue,\r\n£76,000; tribute (mostly to the gaekwar of Baroda), £9000. Many of the\r\ninhabitants belong to the wild tribes of Bhils and Kolis. In 1897 a\r\nmetre-gauge railway was opened from Ahmedabad through Parantij to\r\nAhmednagar. At Sadra is the Scott College for the education of the sons\r\nof chiefs on the lines of an English public school. There are also\r\nAnglo-vernacular schools at Sadra, Idar and Mansa. The famine of\r\n1899-1900 was severely felt in this tract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHMUD I. (1696-1754), sultan of Turkey, was the son of Mustafa II., and\r\nsucceeded his uncle Ahmed III. in 1730. After the suppression of a\r\nmilitary revolt the war with Persia was continued with varying success,\r\nand terminated in 1736 by a treaty of peace restoring the _status quo\r\nante bellum_. The next enemy whom Turkey was called upon to face was\r\nRussia, later joined by Austria. War went on for four years; the\r\nsuccesses gained by Russia were outweighed by Austria's various\r\nreverses, terminating by the defeat of Wallis at Krotzka, and the peace\r\nconcluded at Belgrade was a triumph for Turkish diplomacy. The sultan,\r\nthroughout desirous for peace, is said to have been much under the\r\ninfluence of the chief eunuch, Haji Beshir Aga. In 1754 Mahmud died of\r\nheart-disease when returning from the Friday service at the mosque. He\r\nhad a passion for building, to which are due numberless kiosques, where\r\nnocturnal orgies were carried on by him and his boon companions. In this\r\nreign the system of appointing Phanariote Greeks to the principalities\r\nof Moldavia and Wallachia was instituted. (See PHANARIOTES.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHMUD II. (1785-1839), sultan of Turkey, was the son of Abu-ul-Hamid\r\nI., and succeeded his brother, Mustafa IV., in 1808. He had shared the\r\ncaptivity of his ill-fated cousin, the ex-sultan, Selim III., whose\r\nefforts at reform had ended in his deposition by the janissaries. Mahmud\r\nwas thus early impressed with the necessity for dissembling his\r\nintention to institute reforms until he should be powerful enough to\r\ncarry them through. The reforming efforts of the grand vizier Bairakdar,\r\nto whom he had owed his life and his accession, broke on the opposition\r\nof the janissaries; and Mahmud had to wait for more favourable times.\r\nMeanwhile the empire seemed in danger of breaking up. Not till 1812 was\r\nthe war with Russia closed by the treaty of Bucharest, which restored\r\nMoldavia and the greater part of Wallachia to the Ottoman government.\r\nBut though the war was ended, the terms of the treaty left a number of\r\nburning questions, both internal and external, unsettled. This was\r\nnotably the case with the claim of Russia to Poti and the valley of the\r\nRion (Phasis), which was still outstanding at the time of the congress\r\nof Vienna (1814-1815) and prevented the question of a European guarantee\r\nof the integrity of Turkey from being considered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, within the empire, ambitious valis were one by one attempting\r\nto carve out dominions for themselves at the expense of the central\r\npower. The ambitions of Mehemet Ali of Egypt were not yet fully\r\nrevealed; but Ali (q.v.) of Jannina, who had marched to the aid of the\r\nsultan against the rebellious pasha Pasvan Oglu of Widdin, soon began to\r\nshow his hand, and it needed the concentration of all the forces of the\r\nTurkish empire to effect his overthrow and death (1822). The\r\npreoccupation of the sultan with Ali gave their opportunity to the\r\nGreeks whose disaffection had long been organized in the great secret\r\nsociety of the _Hetaeria Philike_, against which Metternich had in vain\r\nwarned the Ottoman government. In 1821 occurred the abortive raid of\r\nAlexander Ypsilanti into the Danubian principalities, and in May of the\r\nsame year the revolt of the Greeks of the Morea began the war of Greek\r\nIndependence (see GREECE: _History_). The rising in the north was easily\r\ncrushed; but in the south the Ottoman power was hampered by the\r\ndefection of the sea-faring Greeks, by whom the Turkish navy had\r\nhitherto been manned. After three abortive campaigns Mahmud was\r\ncompelled, infinitely against his will, to summon to his assistance the\r\nalready too powerful pasha of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, whom he had already\r\nemployed to suppress the rebellious Wahhabis in Arabia. The disciplined\r\nEgyptian army, supported by a well organized fleet, rapidly accomplished\r\nwhat the Turks had failed to do; and by 1826 the Greeks were practically\r\nsubdued on land, and Ibrahim was preparing to turn his attention to the\r\nislands. But for the intervention of the powers and the battle of\r\nNavarino Mahmud's authority would have been restored in Greece. The news\r\nof Navarino betrayed Mahmud into one of those paroxysms of rage to which\r\nhe was liable, and which on critical occasions were apt fatally to cloud\r\nhis usual good sense. After in vain attempting to obtain an apology for\r\n\"the unparalleled outrage against a friendly power\" he issued on the\r\n20th of December a solemn _hatti sheriff_ summoning the faithful to a\r\nholy war. This, together with certain outstanding grievances and the\r\npretext of enforcing the settlement of the Greek Question approved by\r\nthe powers, gave Russia the excuse for declaring war against Turkey.\r\nAfter two hardly fought campaigns (1828, 1829) Mahmud was at length, on\r\nthe 14th of September 1829, compelled to sign the peace of Adrianople.\r\nFrom this moment until his death Mahmud was, to all intents and\r\npurposes, the \"vassal of Russia,\" though not without occasional\r\ndesperate efforts to break his chains. (For the political events of the\r\nperiod between the first revolt of Mehemet Ali (Sept. 1832) and the\r\ndeath of Mahmud see MEHEMET ALI.) The personal attitude of the sultan,\r\nwhich alone concerns us here, was determined throughout by his\r\novermastering hatred of the upstart pasha, of whom he had stooped to ask\r\naid, and who now defied his will; and the importance of this attitude\r\nlies in the fact that, as the result of the success of his centralizing\r\npolicy, and notably of the destruction of the janissaries (q.v.), the\r\nsupreme authority, hitherto limited by the practical power of the\r\nministers of the Porte and by the turbulence of the privileged military\r\ncaste, had become concentrated in his own person. It was no longer the\r\nPorte that decided, but the Seraglio, and the sultan's private secretary\r\nhad more influence on the policy of the Ottoman empire than the grand\r\nvizier.\r\n\r\nThis omnipotence of the sultan in deciding the policy of the government\r\nwas in striking contrast with his impotence in enforcing his views on\r\nhis subjects and in his relations with foreign powers. Mahmud, in spite\r\nof--or rather because of--his well-meant efforts at reform, was hated by\r\nhis Mussulman subjects and stigmatized as an \"infidel\" and a traitor to\r\nIslam. He was, in fact, a victim to those \"half-measures\" which\r\nMachiavelli condemns as fatal to success. Ibrahim, the conqueror of\r\nSyria, scoffed at the sultan's idea \"that reform consisted in putting\r\nhis soldiers into tight trousers and epaulettes.\" The criticism is not\r\nentirely unjust. Mahmud's policy was the converse of that recommended by\r\nMachiavelli, viz. in making a revolution to change the substance while\r\npreserving the semblance of the old order. Metternich's advice to Mahmud\r\nto \"remain a Turk\" was sound enough. His failure to do so--in\r\nexternals--left him isolated in his empire: _rayahs_ and true believers\r\nalike distrusted and hated him. Of this hatred he was fully conscious;\r\nhe knew that his subjects, even many of his own ministers, regarded\r\nMehemet Ali as the champion of Islam against the \"infidel sultan;\" he\r\nsuspected the pasha, already master of the sacred cities, of an\r\nintention to proclaim himself caliph in his stead. This, together with\r\nthe weakness due to military reforms but recently begun, drove him to\r\nrely on foreign aid; which, in the actual conditions of Europe, meant\r\nthe aid of Russia. The long tradition of French friendship for Turkey\r\nhad been broken, in 1830, by the conquest of Algiers. Austria was, for\r\nthe time, but the faithful ally of the tsar. On the 9th of August 1832\r\nMahmud made, through Stratford Canning, a formal proposal for an\r\nalliance with Great Britain, which Palmerston refused to consider for\r\nfear of offending France. Mahmud bitterly contrasted the fair\r\nprofessions of England with the offers of effective help from Russia.\r\nHis old ally having deserted him, he accepted the aid of his hereditary\r\nfoe. The Russian expedition to the Bosporus, the convention of Kutaiah,\r\nand the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi (July 8, 1833) followed. Mahmud was\r\nunder no illusion as to the position in which the latter placed him\r\ntowards Russia; but his fear of Mehemet Ali and his desire to be\r\nrevenged upon him outweighed all other considerations. He resented the\r\naction of France and England in forcing the settlement of Kutaiah upon\r\nhim, and remained shut up in his palace, inaccessible to all save his\r\nfavourites and the representative of Russia. With his single aim in view\r\nhe busied himself with the creation of a national militia, with the aid\r\nof Moltke and other German officers. In 1834 the revolt of Syria against\r\nIbrahim seemed to give him his opportunity. He pleaded the duty of a\r\nsultan to go to the aid of his subjects when oppressed by one of his\r\nservants; but the powers were obdurate, even Russia, much occupied in\r\naffairs nearer home, leaving him in the lurch. He was astute enough to\r\ntake advantage of the offence given to the powers by Mehemet Ali's\r\nsystem of monopolies, and in 1838 signed with Great Britain, and\r\nafterwards with others, a commercial treaty which cut at the root of the\r\npasha's system. A few months later his passionate impatience overcame\r\nhis policy and his fears. The hand of death was upon him, and he felt\r\nthat he must strike now or never. In vain the powers, now united in\r\ntheir views, warned him of the probable consequences of any aggressive\r\naction on his part. He would rather die, he exclaimed, or become the\r\nslave of Russia, than not destroy his rebellious vassal. On his sole\r\ninitiative, without consulting his ministers or the council of the\r\nempire, he sent instructions to Hafiz Pasha, commanding the Ottoman\r\ntroops concentrated at Bir on the Euphrates, to advance into Syria. The\r\nfatal outcome of the campaign that followed he did not live to hear.\r\nWhen the news of Ibrahim's overwhelming victory at Nessib (June 24,\r\n1839) reached Constantinople, Mahmud lay dying and unconscious. Early in\r\nthe morning of the 1st of July his proud and passionate spirit passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMahmud II. cannot be reckoned among the great sultans, neither had he\r\nany of the calculating statecraft which characterized Abd-ul-Hamid II.;\r\nbut his qualities of mind and heart, none the less, raised him far above\r\nthe mass of his predecessors and successors. He was well versed in state\r\naffairs and loyal to those who advised and served him, personally brave,\r\nhumane and kindly when not maddened by passion, active and energetic,\r\nand always a man of his word. Unhappily, however, the taint of the\r\nimmemorial corruption of Byzantium had fallen upon him too, and the\r\navenue to his favour and to political power lay too often through\r\nunspeakable paths. In view of the vast difficulty of the task before him\r\nat his succession it is less surprising that he failed to carry out his\r\nideas than that he accomplished so much. When he came to the throne the\r\nempire was breaking up from within; one by one he freed the provinces\r\nfrom the tyrannical rulers who, like Ali of Jannina, were carving out\r\nindependent, or quasi-independent, empires within the empire. If he\r\nfailed in his wider schemes of reform, this was only one more\r\nillustration of a truth of which other \"enlightened\" sovereigns besides\r\nhimself had experienced the force, namely, that it is impossible to\r\nimpose any system, however admirable, from above on a people whose\r\ndeepest convictions and prejudices it offends.\r\n\r\n  There is a great deal of valuable material for the history of Mahmud\r\n  and his policy in the unpublished F.O. records (1832-1839), volumes of\r\n  correspondence marked _Turkey.--From Sir Stratford Canning.--From Mr.\r\n  Mandeville.--From Lord Ponsonby._ See further works mentioned under\r\n  TURKEY: _History_; and MEHEMET ALI.     (W. A. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHMUD NEDIM PASHA (c. 1818-1883), Turkish statesman, was the son of\r\nNejib Pasha, ex-governor-general of Bagdad. After occupying various\r\nsubordinate posts at the Porte he became successively under-secretary of\r\nstate for foreign affairs, governor-general of Syria and Smyrna,\r\nminister of commerce, and governor-general of Tripoli; minister\r\nsuccessively of justice and of marine (1869); grand vizier from 1871 to\r\n1872 and from 1875 to 1876. He was high in favour with Sultan\r\nAbd-ul-Aziz and fell much under the influence of General Ignatiev, the\r\nforceful Russian ambassador before the war of 1877-78, his subserviency\r\nto Russia earning for him the nickname of \"Mahmudoff.\" His\r\nadministration was most unsuccessful from every point of view, and he\r\nwas largely responsible for the issue of the decree suspending the\r\ninterest on the Turkish funds. He was minister of the interior from 1879\r\nto 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHMUD[1] OF GHAZNI (971-1030), son of Sabuktagin, Afghan conqueror, was\r\nborn on the 2nd of October 971. His fame rests chiefly on his successful\r\nwars, in particular his numerous invasions of India. His military\r\ncapacity, inherited from his father, Nasir-ud-din Sabuktagin, was\r\nstrengthened by youthful experience in the field. Sabuktagin, a Turki\r\nslave of Alptagin, governor of Khorasan under Abdalmalik I. b. Nuh of\r\nthe Samanid dynasty of Bokhara, early brought himself to notice (see\r\nSAMANIDS). He was raised to high office in the state by Alptagin's\r\nsuccessor, Abu Ishak, and in A.H. 366 (A.D. 977), by the choice of the\r\nnobles of Ghazni, he became their ruler. He soon began to make conquests\r\nin the neighbouring countries, and in these wars he was accompanied by\r\nhis young son Mahmud. Before he had reached the age of fourteen he\r\nencountered in two expeditions under his father the Indian forces of\r\nJaipal, raja of Lahore, whom Sabuktagin defeated on the Punjab frontier.\r\n\r\nIn 994 Mahmud was made governor of Khorasan, with the title of Saif\r\naddaula (ud-daula) (\"Sword of the State\") by the Samanid Nuh II. Two\r\nyears later, his father Sabuktagin died in the neighbourhood of Balkh,\r\nhaving declared his second son, Ismail, who was then with him, to be his\r\nsuccessor. As soon as Ismail had assumed the sovereignty at Balkh,\r\nMahmud, who was at Nishapur, addressed him in friendly terms, proposing\r\na division of the territories held by their father at his death. Ismail\r\nrejected the proposal, and was immediately attacked by Mahmud and\r\ndefeated. Retreating to Ghazni, he there yielded, and was imprisoned,\r\nand Mahmud obtained undisputed power as sovereign of Khorasan and Ghazni\r\n(997).\r\n\r\nThe Ghaznevid dynasty is sometimes reckoned by native historians to\r\ncommence with Sabuktagin's conquest of Bost and Kosdar (978). But\r\nSabuktagin, throughout his reign at Ghazni, continued to acknowledge the\r\nSamanid suzerainty, as did Mahmud also, until the time, soon after\r\nsucceeding to his father's dominions, when he received from Qadir,\r\ncaliph of Bagdad (see CALIPHATE, C. § 25), a _khilat_ (robe of honour),\r\nwith a letter recognizing his sovereignty, and conferring on him the\r\ntitles _Yamiin-addaula_ (\"Right hand of the State\"), and\r\n_Amin-ul-Millat_ (\"Guardian of the Faith\"). From this time it is the\r\nname of the caliph that is inscribed on Mahmud's coins, together with\r\nhis own new titles. Previously the name of the Samanid sovereign, Mansur\r\nII. b. Nuh is given along with his own former title, Saif addaula\r\nMahmud. The earliest of those of the new form gives his name Mahmud bin\r\nSabuktagin. Thereafter his father's name does not appear on his coins,\r\nbut it is inscribed again on his tomb.\r\n\r\nThe new honours received from the caliph gave fresh impulse to Mahmud's\r\nzeal on behalf of Islam, and he resolved on an annual expedition against\r\nthe idolaters of India. He could not quite carry out this intention, but\r\na great part of his reign was occupied with his Indian campaigns. In\r\n1000 he started on the first of these expeditions, but it does not\r\nappear that he went farther than the hill country near Peshawar. The\r\nhostile attitude of Khalaf ibn Ahmad, governor of Seistan, called Mahmud\r\nto that province for a short time. He was appeased by Khalaf's speedy\r\nsubmission, together with the gift of a large sum of money, and further,\r\nit is said, by his subdued opponent addressing him as _sultan_, a title\r\nnew at that time, and by which Mahmud continued to be called, though he\r\ndid not formally adopt it, or stamp it on his coins. Four years later\r\nKhalaf, incurring Mahmud's displeasure again, was imprisoned, and his\r\nproperty confiscated.\r\n\r\nMahmud's army first crossed the Indus in 1001, opposed by Jaipal, raja\r\nof Lahore. Jaipal was defeated, and Mahmud, after his return from this\r\nexpedition, is said to have taken the distinctive appellation of _Ghazi_\r\n(\"Valiant for the Faith\"), but he is rarely so-called. On the next\r\noccasion (1005) Mahmud advanced, as far as Bhera on the Jhelum, when his\r\nadversary Anang-pal, son and successor of Jaipal, fled to Kashmir. The\r\nfollowing year saw Mahmud at Multan. When he was in the Punjab at this\r\ntime, he heard of the invasion of Khorasan by the Ilek Khan Nasr I.\r\nruler of Transoxiana whose daughter Mahmud had married. After a rapid\r\nmarch back from India, Mahmud repelled the invaders. The Ilek Khan,\r\nhaving retreated across the Oxus, returned with reinforcements, and took\r\nup a position a few miles from Balkh, where he was signally defeated by\r\nMahmud.\r\n\r\nMahmud again entered the Punjab in 1008, this time for the express\r\npurpose of chastising Sewah Pal, who, having become a Mussulman, and\r\nbeen left by Mahmud in charge of Multan, had relapsed to Hinduism. The\r\nIndian campaign of 1009 was notable. Near the Indus Mahmud was opposed\r\nagain by Anang-pal, supported by powerful rajas from other parts of\r\nIndia. After a severe fight, Anang-pal's elephants were so terror-struck\r\nby the fire-missiles flung amongst them by the invaders that they turned\r\nand fled, the whole army retreating in confusion and leaving Mahmud\r\nmaster of the field. Mahmud, after this victory, pushed on through the\r\nPunjab to Nagar-kot (Kangra), and carried off much spoil from the Hindu\r\ntemples to enrich his treasury at Ghazni. In 1011 Mahmud, after a short\r\ncampaign against the Afghans under Mahommed ibn Sur in the hill country\r\nof Ghur, marched again into the Punjab. The next time (1014) he advanced\r\nto Thanesar, another noted stronghold of Hinduism, between the Sutlej\r\nand the Jumna. Having now found his way across all the Punjab rivers, he\r\nwas induced on two subsequent occasions to go still farther. But first\r\nhe designed an invasion of Kashmir (1015), which was not carried out, as\r\nhis progress was checked at Loh-kot, a strong hill fort in the\r\nnorth-west of the Punjab. Then before undertaking his longer inroad into\r\nHindustan he had to march north into Khwarizm (Khiva) against his\r\nbrother-in-law Mamun, who had refused to acknowledge Mahmud's supremacy.\r\nThe result was as usual, and Mahmud, having committed Khwarizm to a new\r\nruler, one of Mamun's chief officers, returned to his capital. Then in\r\n1018, with a very large force, he proceeded to India again, extending\r\nhis inroad this time to the great Hindu cities of Mathra on the Jumna\r\nand Kanauj on the Ganges. He reduced the one, received the submission of\r\nthe other, and carried back great stores of plunder. Three years later\r\nhe went into India again, marching over nearly the same ground, to the\r\nsupport, this time, of the raja of Kanauj, who, having made friendship\r\nwith the Mahommedan invader on his last visit, had been attacked by the\r\nraja of Kalinjar. But Mahmud found he had not yet sufficiently subdued\r\nthe idolaters nearer his own border, between Kabul and the Indus, and\r\nthe campaign of 1022 was directed against them, and reached no farther\r\nthan Peshawar. Another march into India the following year was made\r\ndirect to Gwalior.\r\n\r\nThe next expedition (1025) is the most famous of all. The point to which\r\nit was directed was the temple of Somnath on the coast of the Gujarat\r\npeninsula. After an arduous journey by Multan, and through part of\r\nRajputana, he reached Somnath, and met with a very vigorous but\r\nfruitless resistance on the part of the Hindus of Gujarat. Moslem feet\r\nsoon trod the courts of the great temple. The chief object of worship it\r\ncontained was broken up, and the fragments kept to be carried off to\r\nGhazni. The story is often told of the hollow figure, cleft by Mahmud's\r\nbattle-axe, pouring out great store of costly jewels and gold. But the\r\nidol in this Sivite temple was only a tall block or pillar of hewn\r\nstone, of a familiar kind. The popular legend is a very natural one.\r\nMahmud, it was well known, made Hindu temples yield up their most\r\nprecious things. He was a determined idol-breaker. And the stone block\r\nin this temple was enriched with a crown of jewels, the gifts of wealthy\r\nworshippers. These data readily give the Somnath exploit its more\r\ndramatic form. For the more recent story of the Somnath gates see\r\nSOMNATH.\r\n\r\nAfter the successes at Somnath, Mahmud remained some months in India\r\nbefore returning to Ghazni. Then in 1026 he crossed the Indus once more\r\ninto the Punjab. His brilliant military career closed with an expedition\r\nto Persia, in the third year after this, his last, visit to India. The\r\nIndian campaigns of Mahmud and his father were almost, but not\r\naltogether, unvarying successes. The Moslem historians touch lightly on\r\nreverses. And, although the annals of Rajputana tell how Sabuktagin was\r\ndefeated by one raja of Ajmere and Mahmud by his successor, the course\r\nof events which followed shows how little these and other reverses\r\naffected the invader's progress. Mahmud's failure at Ajmere, when the\r\nbrave raja Bisal-deo obliged him to raise the siege but was himself\r\nslain, was when the Moslem army was on its way to Somnath. Yet Mahmud's\r\nIndian conquests, striking and important in themselves, were, after all,\r\nin great measure barren, except to the Ghazni treasury. Mahmud retained\r\nno possessions in India under his own direct rule. But after the\r\nrepeated defeats, by his father and himself, of two successive rajas of\r\nLahore, the conqueror assumed the right of nominating the governors of\r\nthe Punjab as a dependency of Ghazni, a right which continued to be\r\nexercised by seven of his successors. And for a time, in the reign of\r\nMasa'ud II. (1098-1114), Lahore was the place of residence of the\r\nGhaznevid sovereign.\r\n\r\nMahmud died at Ghazni in 1030, the year following his expedition to\r\nPersia. He is conspicuous for his military ardour, his ambition, strong\r\nwill, perseverance, watchfulness and energy, combined with great courage\r\nand unbounded self-reliance. But his tastes were not exclusively\r\nmilitary. His love of literature brought men of learning to Ghazni, and\r\nhis acquaintance with Moslem theology was recognized by the learned\r\ndoctors.\r\n\r\n  The principal histories of Mahmud's reign are--_Kitab-i-Yamini_\r\n  (Utbi); _Tarikh-us-Subuktigin_ (Baihaki); _Tabakat i Nasiri_ (Minhaj\r\n  el-Siraj); _Rauzat-us-Safa_ (Mir Khond); _Habib-us-Sivar_ (Khondamir).\r\n  See Elliot, _History of India_; Elphinstone, _History of India_; and\r\n  Roos-Keppel's translation of the _Tarikh-i-Sultan Mahmud-i-Ghaznavi_\r\n  (1901).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The name is strictly Mahmud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOBA, an ancient town in India, in Hamirpur district of the United\r\nProvinces. Pop. (1901), 10,074. As the capital of the Chandel dynasty,\r\nwho ruled over Bundelkhand from the 9th to the 13th century, the\r\nneighbourhood is covered with architectural antiquities, prominent among\r\nwhich are artificial lakes, formed by banking up valleys with masonry\r\ndams. The largest of these is more than 4 m. in circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOGANY, a dark-coloured wood largely used for household furniture, the\r\nproduct of a large tree indigenous to Central America and the West\r\nIndies. It was originally received from Jamaica; 521,300 ft. were\r\nexported from that island in 1753. It is known botanically as _Swietenia\r\nMahogani_, and is a member of the order _Meliaceae_. It bears compound\r\nleaves, resembling those of the ash, and clusters of small flowers, with\r\nfive sepals and petals and ten stamens which are united into a tube. The\r\nfruit is a pear-shaped woody capsule, and contains many winged seeds.\r\nThe dark-coloured bark has been considered a febrifuge, and the seeds\r\nwere used by the ancient Aztecs with oil for a cosmetic, but the most\r\nvaluable product is the timber, first noticed by the carpenter on board\r\nSir Walter Raleigh's ship in 1595 for its great beauty, hardness and\r\ndurability. Dr Gibbons brought it into notice as well adapted for\r\nfurniture in the early part of the 18th century, and its use as a\r\ncabinet wood was first practically established by a cabinet-maker named\r\nWollaston, who was employed by Gibbons to work up some mahogany brought\r\nto England by his brother. It was introduced into India in 1795, and is\r\nnow cultivated in Bengal and as far north as Saharunpur.\r\n\r\n  The timber of species of _Cedrela_ and _Melia_, other members of the\r\n  order _Meliaceae_, are used as Mahogany, and the product of the West\r\n  African _Khaya senegalensis_ is known as African mahogany. There is\r\n  some confusion between the product of these various trees. Herbert\r\n  Stone (_The Timbers of Commerce_, 1904) says: \"The various species of\r\n  mahogany and cedar are so confusing that it is difficult to make\r\n  precise statements as to their structure or origin. I know of no\r\n  convincing proof that any of the American kinds met with on the\r\n  English market are the wood of _Swietenia Mahogani_, nor that those\r\n  shipped from Africa are the wood of _Khaya senegalensis_. These two\r\n  genera are very nearly allied to _Cedrela_ and _Melia_, and it is\r\n  difficult to separate any of the four from the rest by the characters\r\n  of the wood. After giving the most careful attention to every detail,\r\n  I lean to the view that most if not all of the mahoganies commonly met\r\n  with are Cedrelas.\"\r\n\r\n  _Kiggelaria Dregeana_ (natural order _Bixineae_), a native of South\r\n  Africa, is known as Natal mahogany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOMET (strictly MUHAMMAD, commonly also MOHAMMED), founder of the\r\nreligious system called in Europe after him Mahommedanism, and by\r\nhimself Islam or Hanifism. He died, according to the ordinary\r\nsynchronism, on the 7th of June 632 (12 Rabia, A.H. 11), and his\r\nbirthday was exactly sixty-three or sixty-five years earlier, the latter\r\nnumber being evidently an interpretation in lunar years of a number\r\nthought to refer to solar years. The lunar system was introduced into\r\nArabia by Mahomet himself quite at the close of his career; that which\r\nexisted before was certainly solar, as it involved a process of\r\nintercalation--which, however, seems to have been arbitrarily\r\nmanipulated by priests, whence certain synchronisms cannot be got for\r\nthe events in the Prophet's career. The number 63 for the years of his\r\nlife may rest on tradition, though it is unlikely that such matters were\r\naccurately noted; it can also be accounted for by a priori combination.\r\nA Meccan, it is said, became a full citizen at the age of 40; this then\r\nwould be the age at which the mission might be started. The Medina\r\nperiod (of which count was kept) lasted ten to eleven years; for the\r\nMeccan period ten years would seem a likely length. Finally it was known\r\nthat for some years--about three--the mission had been conducted\r\nsecretly. The only event in contemporary history to which the Koran\r\nalludes in its earlier parts is the Persian conquest of Palestine in\r\n616. Clearly Mahomet had begun to prophesy at that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n  His Country.\r\n\r\nBefore the rise of Islam, Mahomet's native place, Mecca, appears to\r\nfigure nowhere in historical records, unless there be a reference to it\r\nin the \"valley of Baca\" (Psalm lxxxiv. 6). Its sacred, and therefore\r\narchaic, name is _Bakkah_; hence the identification of the name with\r\nthat of the sanctuary Makoraba, known to the Greek geographers, is not\r\nphilologically tenable; although so eminent a linguist as Dozy evolved a\r\ntheory of the origin of the city from this name, which appears to be\r\nSouth Arabian for \"sanctuary,\" and has no connexion with Hebrew (as Dozy\r\nsupposed). In the 3rd century of Islam the mythology of Mecca was\r\ncollected and published in book form, but we learn little more from it\r\nthan names of tribes and places; it is clear that there was no record of\r\nthe mode in which the community inhabiting the place had got there, and\r\nthat little was remembered with accuracy of the events which preceded\r\nthe rise of its prophet. The city had a sanctuary, called the _Cube_\r\n(_ka'ba_), of which the nucleus was the \"Black Stone,\" probably to be\r\nidentified with Allah, the god of the community; both still exist, or\r\nrather their legitimate substitutes, as the Ka`ba has been repeatedly\r\nreconstructed, and the original Black Stone was stolen by the\r\nCarmathians in the 4th century of Islam; they afterwards returned one,\r\nbut it may or may not have been the same as that which they removed. At\r\nsome time in the 6th century--said to have been the birth-year of the\r\nProphet, but really much earlier--an Abyssinian invader raided Mecca\r\nwith the view of abolishing this sanctuary; but for some reason had to\r\ndesist. This expedition, known as the \"Raid of the Elephant,\" one of\r\nthese animals being employed in it, seems to be of great importance for\r\nexplaining the rise of Islam; for a sanctuary which can repel an invader\r\nacquires tremendous reputation. Some verses in the Koran which are\r\nperhaps not genuine, record the miracle whereby Allah repelled the\r\n\"People of the Elephant.\" The sanctuary was apparently in the possession\r\nof the tribe Koreish (Quraish), the origin of whose name is unknown,\r\nsaid to have come originally from Cutha in Mesopotamia. They were known\r\n(we are told) as the people of Allah, and, by wearing a badge, were\r\nsacrosanct throughout Arabia. If this be true, it was probably a\r\nprivilege earned by the miraculous defence of the Ka`ba, and is\r\nsufficient to account for the rise of Meccan commerce of which we hear\r\nmuch in the biography of the Prophet, and to which some verses of the\r\nearliest part of the Koran allude; for merchants who were safe from\r\nattacks by bandits would have an enormous advantage. The records seem,\r\nhowever, to be inconsistent with this assertion; and the growth of the\r\nMeccan commerce is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that after the\r\nAbyssinian invasion pilgrimage to the Ka`ba became the practice of\r\nnumerous Arab tribes, and for four months in the year (selected by\r\nMeccan priests) raiding was forbidden, in order to enable the pilgrimage\r\nto be safely made. In addition to this it would seem that all Mecca\r\ncounted as sanctuary--i.e. no blood might under any circumstances be\r\nshed there. The community lived by purveying to pilgrims and the\r\ncarrying trade; and both these operations led to the immigration of\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mahomet's Family.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that Mahomet was himself a member of the\r\ntribe Koreish, and indeed too many of his relatives figure in history to\r\npermit of his parentage being questioned. His cousin 'Ali, fourth\r\ncaliph, was the son of Abu Talib, whose name attests the historical\r\ncharacter of the kindred name `Abd al-Mottalib, Mahomet's grandfather:\r\nfor the fact that this name is in part enigmatical is certainly no\r\nargument against its genuineness. In the 3rd century of Islam a document\r\nwas shown in which a man of San'a in Yemen acknowledged that he had\r\nborrowed from `Abd al-Mottalib 1000 silver dirhems of the Hudaida\r\nstandard, and Allah with the two \"angels\" (probably a euphemism for the\r\ngoddesses Al-lat and al-`Uzza) served as witness; it is difficult to see\r\nwhy such a document should have been forged. The name Hashim (for `Abd\r\nal-Mottalib's father) may or may not be historical; here, as in the\r\nascending line throughout, we have subjects without predicates. The name\r\nof `Abd al-Mottalib's son, who was Mahomet's father, is given as\r\n`Abdallah; the correctness of this has been questioned, because \"Servant\r\nof Allah\" would seem to be too appropriate, and the name was often given\r\nby the Prophet to converts as a substitute for some pagan appellation.\r\nThis, however, is hypercritical, as the name of the father could not\r\neasily be altered, when relatives abounded, and it would seem that at\r\none time the Prophet made no theological use of the name Allah, for\r\nwhich he intended to substitute Rahman. The name of his mother is given\r\nas Aminah, and with this one of his own titles, Amin, agrees; although\r\nthe Arabs do not appear to bring the two into connexion. Her father's\r\nname is given as Wahb, and she is brought into relation with a Medinese\r\ntribe called the Banu `Adi b. al-Najjar, to whom she is said to have\r\nbrought her son in his early infancy. The circumstances may have been\r\nsuggested by his later connexion with that place; yet in what seems a\r\nhistorical narrative her grave is mentioned as known to be at Abwa,\r\nmidway between the two cities, whence this early bond between the\r\nProphet and his future home may have really existed.\r\n\r\nHis own name is given in the Koran in the forms Ahmad and the familiar\r\nMuhammad; in contemporary poetry we also find the form Mahmud. Similar\r\nvariation between derivatives from the same root is found in proper\r\nnames which occur in early poetry; the meaning of all would be \"the\r\npraised,\" if the root be given its Arabic signification--\"the desired\"\r\nif interpreted from the Hebrew.\r\n\r\n  The form Muhammad (ordinarily transliterated Mohammed; Mahomet,\r\n  Mehmet, &c., represent the Turkish pronunciation) is found in a\r\n  pre-Islamic inscription, and appears to have been fairly common in\r\n  Arabia. In Hag. ii. 7 a derivative of the Hebrew equivalent root\r\n  occurs in the prophecy \"and the desired of all nations shall come,\"\r\n  and this passage has suggested the idea that the name may have been\r\n  taken by the Prophet as the equivalent of \"Messiah,\" while the Moslems\r\n  themselves find its equivalent in the _Paraclete_ of the Fourth\r\n  Gospel, though this identification requires more ingenuity. His\r\n  _kunyah_ (i.e. the Arab title of respect, in which a man is called\r\n  after his son) is Abu'l-Qasim; other names by which he is called are\r\n  titles of honour, e.g. Mustafa \"chosen.\" (See further the genealogical\r\n  table, _ad fin._)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early Life.\r\n\r\nIn the Koran, Allah says that He found the Prophet an orphan, poor and\r\nastray; it is possible that all these expressions should be understood\r\nfiguratively, like the \"poor, naked, blind\" of Christian hymns; the\r\nArabs, however, take them literally, and Mahomet is said to have been a\r\nposthumous child, whose mother died a few months or years after his\r\nbirth, and who was brought up first by his grandfather, and then by his\r\nuncle Abu Talib, one of the poorer members of the family; in the\r\ncontroversy between the Alid and Abbasid pretenders of the 2nd century\r\nof Islam the Abbasid Mansur claims that his ancestor fed the ancestor of\r\n`Ali, i.e. Abu Talib, otherwise he would have had to beg. There was\r\nevidently an apparent inconsistency between Mahomet's being a poor\r\norphan and the favourite grandchild of the eminent and wealthy `Abd\r\nal-Mottalib; and it was solved in this way. There was a tradition that\r\nin his early years he was sent into the desert to acquire the habits and\r\nthe language of the Bedouins; and this seems to have been attested by\r\nthe Prophet himself. In a tribal fight he is said to have acted as\r\narmour-bearer to one of his uncles, Zubair. There seems no doubt that he\r\noften accompanied Meccan caravans to the countries with which the\r\nMeccans had trade relations; such especially were Syria and south\r\nArabia, and perhaps Egypt and Mesopotamia. It is conceivable that he may\r\nhave visited Abyssinia by sea. For though accurate knowledge is nowhere\r\nto be found in the Koran, it exhibits a large amount of miscellaneous\r\ninformation, such as a trader might well pick up. His career as a\r\ncaravan-conductor appears to have terminated with his marriage to\r\nKhadija, daughter of Khuwailid, represented by the tradition as a\r\nwealthy widow, fifteen years his senior and forty years of age at the\r\ntime of the union. As she became the mother of a numerous family, a\r\nspecial rule was discovered by Moslem physiologists extending the\r\nchild-bearing period of Korashite women beyond that of others. Since it\r\nis claimed for Mahomet that he first gave Arab women the right to\r\ninherit property, the difficulty noticed is not the only one connected\r\nwith this marriage; and Robertson Smith has called attention to some\r\nothers, unconnected with his theory of \"marriage and kinship in early\r\nArabia.\" After his marriage Mahomet appears to have been partner in a\r\nshop in Mecca; where he apparently sold agricultural produce. His style\r\nis strongly marked by phrases and metaphors drawn from trade, though as\r\na statesman he never displayed any financial ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Education.\r\n\r\nWriting in the monumental script of South Arabia had been known for\r\ncenturies in the peninsula; and shortly before the rise of Islam a\r\ncursive script--the parent of the ordinary Arabic character--had been\r\nstarted in the Christian state of Hira, with which the beginnings of\r\nmodern Arabic literature are connected. A modification of this had been\r\nintroduced into Mecca, and was probably used for contracts and similar\r\ndocuments. The word _ummi_, literally \"popular\" or \"plebeian\" (according\r\nto one etymology), applied to Mahomet in the Koran, is said to mean \"one\r\nwho can neither read nor write,\" and the most generally accepted view is\r\nthat he could do neither, a supposition which enters into the doctrine\r\nof the miraculous nature of the Koran. According to another\r\ninterpretation the word means \"Meccan,\" i.e. native of \"the Mother of\r\nthe Villages\" (_Umm al-Qura_); and the most probable theory is that he\r\ncould do both, but unskilfully. Indeed on one historic occasion he\r\nerased certain words in a document; and where in the Koran he rebuts the\r\ncharge of \"taking notes,\" he does not employ the obvious retort that he\r\ncould not write, but gives a far less convincing answer. For poetry,\r\nwhich seems to have been cultivated in Arabia long before his time, he\r\npossessed no ear; but we have little reason for supposing that either\r\nwriting or versification had yet entered into Arabian education. The\r\nformer would be acquired by those who needed it, the latter was regarded\r\nas a natural gift. There is reason for thinking the language of the\r\nKoran incorrect and ungrammatical in parts, but as it afterwards became\r\nthe ultimate standard of classical Arabic, this point is not easy to\r\nprove. On the whole then his early life seems to have been such as was\r\nnormal in the case of a man belonging to one of the more important\r\nfamilies in a community which had not long been started on a career of\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Social System.\r\n\r\nOf the organization of that community we unfortunately know very little,\r\nthough we hear of a council-chamber, and, as has been seen, of an\r\nage-qualification for admission to it. It is, however, certain that the\r\ntheory of decision by majority was absolutely unknown to Mahomet's\r\nsecond successor, whence we learn little from this tradition (even if it\r\nbe authentic) of the mode whereby the tribes who together formed the\r\nMeccan population managed their common concerns, whether commercial or\r\npolitical. The form of government seems to have been a rudimentary\r\noligarchy, directed by some masterful individual; before the Flight we\r\nread of various prominent personages, after the Flight and the battle of\r\nBadr (A.H. 2) one chieftain, Abu Sofian (see CALIPHATE, _ad init._),\r\nappears to take the lead whether in war or in policy. It would seem,\r\nhowever, that the right of independent action belonged to the individual\r\ntribes, even to the extent of refusing to take part in a campaign. For\r\nthe settlement of ordinary disputes recourse was had (it appears) rather\r\nto soothsayers, near or distant, than to any regularly constituted\r\nauthority or tribunal. On the other hand we are furnished with a list of\r\nofficials who were concerned with different parts of the festal\r\nperformances and the ordinary worship. Of these we may mention the\r\nCustodian of the Ka`ba, and the official whose duty was _siqayah_\r\n(\"watering\"), said to mean furnishing the pilgrims with water, but more\r\ningeniously interpreted in recent times as \"rain-bringing,\" a function\r\nwhich even in the 2nd century of Islam the governor in some places was\r\nsupposed to exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Beginnings of the Mission.\r\n\r\nOf Arabian paganism we possess no trustworthy or complete account; since\r\nwe hear of no theological literature belonging to it, probably no such\r\naccount could have been given. There were doubtless a variety of\r\npractices, many of which have been continued to this day in the\r\nceremonies of the pilgrimage, and offerings of different sorts to\r\nvarious deities, interpreted variously by the worshippers in accordance\r\nwith their spiritual, intellectual and moral levels; e.g. as actual\r\nstones, or as men (or more often women) residing in the stones or\r\notherwise connected with them, or bearing a similar relation to trees,\r\nor stars, &c. In general every tribe had its patron of the kind, and\r\nwhere there were aggregations of tribes, connexions were established\r\nbetween these deities, and affiliation-theories excogitated; hence the\r\ntheory attributed in the Koran to the Meccans that the goddesses\r\nal-`Uzza, &c. were the daughters of Allah, may well represent the\r\noutcome of such speculation. These, however, were known to few, whereas\r\nthe practices were familiar to all. Some of these were harmless, others\r\nbarbarous; many offensive, but not very reprehensible, superstitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  External Influences.\r\n\r\nBefore Mahomet's time Arabian paganism had already been attacked both\r\nfrom the outside and from the inside. On the one hand the northern\r\ntribes had gradually been christianized, owing to the influence of the\r\nByzantine empire; on the other hand south Arabia had fallen successively\r\nunder Jewish, Abyssinian and Persian influence; and the last, though\r\nlittle is known of Persian rule, is unlikely to have favoured pagan\r\ncults. Christianity had also some important representation in Najran far\r\nsouth of Mecca, while Jewish settlements were prospering north of Mecca\r\nin the Prophet's future home Yathrib and its neighbourhood. Power,\r\ncivilization and learning were thus associated with monotheism\r\n(Judaism), dualism (Mazdaism) and tritheism (as the Arabs interpreted\r\nChristianity); paganism was the religion of ignorance (_jahiliyyah_,\r\ninterpreted by Goldziher as \"barbarism,\" but the difference is not very\r\nconsiderable). Mecca itself and the neighbouring and allied Taif are\r\nsaid to have produced some monotheists or Christians, who identified the\r\n_Allah_ of Mecca with the _Allaha_ or God of the Syrian Christians,\r\ncalled by the Abyssinian Christians \"Lord of the Regions,\" and by the\r\nJews \"the Merciful\" (_Rahmana_); one such is said to have been a cousin\r\nof Khadija, Mahomet's wife; his name is given as Waraqah, son of Naufal,\r\nand he is credited with copying or translating a Gospel. We even hear of\r\nflagellant monks and persons vowed to total abstinence among the\r\nprecursors of Islam.\r\n\r\nWith these persons Mahomet had little in common, since they do not\r\nappear to have claimed to enforce their views upon others, or to have\r\ninterfered with politics. He appears mainly to have been struck by the\r\npersonality of the founders of the systems dominant in the civilized\r\nworld, and to have aspired from the first to occupy the place of\r\nlegislator or mouthpiece of the Deity; and that he was this was and is\r\nthe main proposition of the Mahommedan creed. The \"Prophet\" or \"Apostle\"\r\n(at different times he employed both the Jewish and the Christian\r\nphrase) was the divinely appointed dictator of his community; if he were\r\nnot obeyed, divine vengeance would overtake the disobedient. At this\r\nproposition Mahomet arrived by induction from the records of the\r\nBiblical prophets, as well as others who seem to have figured in Arabian\r\nmythology, e.g. the destruction of the tribe Thamud (mentioned by Pliny,\r\nand therefore historical) for their disobedience to their prophet Salih,\r\nand of `Ad (probably mythical) for their similar treatment of Hud. The\r\ncharacter of the message did not affect the necessity for obedience; at\r\ntimes it was condemnation of some moral offence, at others a trivial\r\norder. Divine vengeance overtook those who disobeyed either.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Prophet's Call.\r\n\r\nThis is the theory of the prophetic office which pervades the Koran,\r\nwherein the doctrine is formulated that every nation had its divine\r\nguide and that Mecca before Mahomet's time had none. This place, then,\r\nMahomet felt a divine call to fill. But we are never likely to ascertain\r\nwhat first put the idea into his mind. The fables which his biographers\r\ntell on this subject are not worth repeating; his own system, in which\r\nhe is brought into direct communication with the Deity, though at a\r\nlater period the angel Gabriel appears to have acted as intermediary,\r\nnaturally leaves no room for such speculations; and since his\r\ndispensation was thought to be absolutely new, and to make a _tabula\r\nrasa_ of the pagan past, his first followers, having broken with that\r\npast, left no intelligible account of the state of affairs which\r\npreceded their master's call. Some generations therefore elapsed before\r\nthat past was studied with any sort of sympathy, and details could not\r\nthen be recovered, any more than they can now be supplied by conjecture.\r\n\r\nSo far as Mahomet may be said from the first to have formulated a\r\ndefinite notion of his work, we should probably be right in thinking it\r\nto be the restoration of the religion of Abraham, or (as the Koran calls\r\nhim) Ibrahim. Though we have no reason for supposing the name of Abraham\r\nor Ishmael to have been known in Mecca generally before Mahomet's time,\r\nthe Biblical ethnology was not apparently questioned by those who were\r\ntold of it, and there are stories, not necessarily apocryphal, of\r\nprecursors of Mahomet going abroad in search of the \"religion of\r\nAbraham.\" One feature of that system, associated in the Bible with the\r\nname of Ishmael as well, was circumcision, which was actually observed\r\nby the Meccan tribes, though it would appear with technical differences\r\nfrom the Jewish method; the association of monotheism with it would seem\r\nreasonable enough, in view of Jewish traditions, such as Mahomet may\r\nhave heard on his travels; why the doctrine of the future life should be\r\ncoupled with it is less obvious. That the Meccan temple and its rites\r\nhad been founded by these two patriarchs appears to have been deduced by\r\nMahomet himself, but perhaps at a later stage of his career. That these\r\nrites, so far as they were idolatrous, were in flagrant defiance of the\r\nreligion of Abraham must have struck any one who accepted the accounts\r\nof it which were current among Jews and Christians. The precursors,\r\nhowever, appear to have felt no call to reform their fellow-citizens;\r\nwhereas it is evident that Mahomet regarded himself as charged with a\r\nmessage, which he was bound to deliver, and which his God would in some\r\nway render effective.\r\n\r\nAs it was obvious that the claim to be God's mouthpiece was to claim\r\nautocracy, Mahomet employed the utmost caution in his mode of asserting\r\nthis claim; on the question of his sincerity there have been different\r\nopinions held, and it is not necessary to take any view on this matter.\r\nFor three years his followers were a secret society; and this period\r\nappears to have been preceded by one of private preparation, the first\r\nrevelation being received when the Prophet was in religious\r\nretirement--a ceremony called _tahannuth_, of which the meaning is\r\nuncertain, but which can have no connexion with the Hebrew _tehinnoth_\r\n(\"supplications\")--on Mount Hira, near Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Koran.\r\n\r\nIf the traditional dates assigned to the _suras_ (chapters) of the Koran\r\n(q.v.) are correct, the earliest revelations took the form of pages or\r\nrolls which the Prophet was to read by the \"grace of God,\" as Joseph\r\nSmith, the founder of the Mormon community, said of the power given him\r\nto read the \"Egyptian\" characters on the gold plates which he had found.\r\nThe command to read is accompanied by the statement that \"his most\r\ngenerous Lord had taught man by the pen (_calamus_) that which he did\r\nnot know.\" Waraqah, to whom the event is said to have been communicated\r\nby Khadija, called these communications \"the Greater Law (_nomos_).\" The\r\nProphet was directed to communicate his mission at the first only to his\r\nnearest relatives. The utterances were from the first in a sort of\r\nrhyme, such as is said to have been employed for solemn matter in\r\ngeneral, e.g. oracles or prayers. At an early period the production of a\r\nwritten communication was abandoned for oral communications, delivered\r\nby the Prophet in trance; their delivery was preceded by copious\r\nperspiration, for which the Prophet prepared (in accordance with\r\ninstructions found in the Koran) by wrapping himself in a blanket.\r\nTrusty followers were instructed to take these utterances down, but the\r\nphenomena which accompanied their delivery at least in one case\r\nsuggested imposture to the scribe, who apostatized in consequence. It is\r\nextraordinary that there is no reason to suppose that any official\r\nrecord was ever kept of these revelations; the Prophet treated them\r\nsomewhat as the Sibyl did her leaves. This carelessness is equally\r\nastounding whether the Prophet was sincere or insincere.\r\n\r\nIf the matter afterwards collected in the Koran be genuine, the early\r\nrevelations must have been miscellaneous in content, magical, historical\r\nand homiletic. To some strange oaths are prefixed. Apparently the\r\npurpose to be compassed was to convince the audience of their miraculous\r\norigin. The formulation of doctrines belongs to a later period and that\r\nof jurisprudence to the latest of all. In that last period also, when\r\nMahomet was despot of Medina, the Koran served as an official chronicle,\r\nwell compared by Sprenger to the leading articles on current events in a\r\nministerial organ. Where the continuous paragraph is substituted for the\r\nejaculation, the divine author apologizes for the style.\r\n\r\nCertain doctrines and practices (e.g. washing of the person and the\r\ngarments) must have been enjoined from the first, but our authorities\r\nscarcely give us any clear notion what they were. The doctrines to which\r\nthe Prophet himself throughout assigned most value seem to have been the\r\nunity of God and the future life, or resurrection of the body. The\r\nformer necessitated the abandonment of the idolatrous worship which\r\nformed part of the daily life of Mecca, and in which Mahomet and Khadija\r\nhad been accustomed to take their part. Yet it seems to have been due to\r\nthe initiative of the proselytes themselves rather than to the Prophet's\r\norders that the Meccan worship was actually flouted by them; for the\r\nanecdote which represents the Prophet and his young cousin attempting to\r\npull down the images in or about the Ka'ba appears to be apocryphal. The\r\nfirst Moslem ceremony would appear to have been the religious meeting\r\nfor the purpose of hearing the delivery of revelations, of which after\r\nthe Prophet's death the sermon (_khutbah_) took the place. After various\r\nprovisional meeting-places, the house of one al-Arqam on Mt. Safa was\r\nadopted for this purpose; and here proselytes were initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Growth of the Early Community.\r\n\r\nThe names which the new community received from its founder are both\r\nphilological puzzles; for the natural sense of Moslem (_Muslim_) appear\r\nto be \"traitors,\" and to this a contemporary war-song of Mahomet's\r\nenemies alludes; while _Hanif_ (especially applied in the Koran to\r\nAbraham) seems to be the Hebrew word for \"hypocrite.\" The former is\r\nexplained in the Koran to mean \"one who hands over his face or person to\r\nGod,\" and is said to have been invented by Abraham; of the latter no\r\nexplanation is given, but it seems to signify from the context\r\n\"devotee.\" Since the divine name _Rahman_ was at one time favoured by\r\nMahomet, and this was connected with one Maslama of the tribe Hanifa,\r\nwho figures in politics at the end of Mahomet's career but must have\r\nbeen a religious leader far earlier, it has been suggested that the\r\nnames originally belonged to Maslama's community. The honour of having\r\nbeen Mahomet's first convert is claimed for three persons: his wife\r\nKhadija, his cousin Ali, who must have been a lad at the commencement of\r\nthe mission, and Abu Bekr, son of Abu Quhafah, afterwards Mahomet's\r\nfirst successor. This last person became Mahomet's _alter ego_, and is\r\nusually known as the _Siddiq_ (Heb. word signifying \"the saint,\" but to\r\nthe Arabs meaning \"faithful friend)\". His loyalty from first to last was\r\nabsolutely unswerving; he was selected to accompany Mahomet on the most\r\ncritical occasion of his life, the Flight from Mecca; Mahomet is said to\r\nhave declared that had he ever made a confidant of any one, that person\r\nwould have been Abu Bekr; implying that there were things which were not\r\nconfided even to him. The success of the Prophet's enterprise seems to\r\nhave been very largely due to the part played by this adherent, who\r\npossessed a variety of attainments which he put at Mahomet's service;\r\nwho when an intermediary was required was always ready to represent him,\r\nand who placed the commendation of the Prophet above every other\r\nconsideration, private or public. The two appear to have regularly laid\r\nsiege to those persons in Mecca whose adherence was desirable; and the\r\nability which many of the earlier converts afterwards displayed, whether\r\nas statesmen or generals, is a remarkable testimony to their power of\r\ngauging men. It seems clear that the growth of wealth in Mecca had led\r\nto the accentuation of the difference between persons of different\r\nstation, and that many were discontented with the oligarchy which\r\ngoverned the city. Converts could, therefore, be won without serious\r\ndifficulty among the aliens and in general those who suffered under\r\nvarious disqualifications. Some members of the Jewish community seem\r\nalso to have joined; and some relics of the Abyssinian expedition (i.e.\r\ndescendants of the invaders). Among the most important converts of the\r\nMeccan period were Mahomet's uncle Hamza, afterwards for his valour\r\ncalled \"the Lion of God\"; 'Abd al-Rahman (Abdar-rahman) son of 'Auf;\r\nOthman, son of 'Affan, who married two of the Prophet's daughters\r\nsuccessively, and was Mahomet's third successor; and, more important\r\nthan any save Abu Bekr, Omar, son of al-Khattab, a man of extraordinary\r\nforce of character, to whom siege seems to have been laid with\r\nextraordinary skill. At some time he received the honourable title\r\n_Faruq_ (\"Deliverer\"); he is represented as regularly favouring force,\r\nwhere Abu Bekr favoured gentle methods; unlike Abu Bekr, his loyalty was\r\nnot always above suspicion. His adherence is ascribed to the period of\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\nThe secrecy which marked its early years was of the greatest value for\r\nthe eventual success of the mission; for when Mahomet came forward\r\npublicly he was already the head of a band of united followers. His own\r\nfamily appear to have been either firm adherents, or violent enemies, or\r\nlukewarm and temporizing--this is the best which can be said for 'Abbas,\r\neponymus of the Abbasid dynasty; or finally espousers of his cause, on\r\nfamily grounds, but not as believers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  First Period of Publicity.\r\n\r\nRejecting accounts of Mahomet's first appearance as a public preacher,\r\nwhich are evidently comments on a text of the Koran, we have reason for\r\nsupposing that his hand was forced by ardent followers, who many times\r\nin his career compelled him to advance. The astute rulers of the\r\ncommunity perceived that the claim made by Mahomet was to be dictator or\r\nautocrat; and while this was naturally ridiculed by them, some appear to\r\nhave been devoted adherents of the gods or goddesses whom he attacked.\r\nThe absence of dated documents for the period between this open\r\nproclamation (which in any case commenced before 616) and the Flight to\r\nMedina in 622 renders the course of events somewhat conjectural, though\r\ncertain details appear to be well established. Apparently there was a\r\nwar of words, followed by a resort to diplomacy and then to force; and\r\nthen a period in which Mahomet's attention was directed to foreign\r\nconversions, resulting in his being offered and accepting the\r\ndictatorship of Yathrib.\r\n\r\nOf the war of words we have an imperfect record in the Meccan suras of\r\nthe Koran, which occasionally state the objections urged by the\r\nopponents. In the course of the debate the theological position of both\r\nparties seems to have shifted, and the knowledge of both was probably\r\nincreased in various ways. The miracle of the Koran, which at first\r\nconsisted in its mode of production, was transformed into a marvel\r\nconnected with its contents; first by Mahomet's claiming to tell\r\nhistorical narratives which had previously been unknown to him;\r\nafterwards by the assertion that the united efforts of mankind and Jinn\r\nwould be unable to match the smallest passage of the Koran in sublimity.\r\nProbably the first of these claims could not be long maintained, though\r\nA. J. Davis, \"the Seer of Poughkeepsie,\" in our own time brought a\r\nsimilar one in regard to his _Principles of Nature_. Indeed both parties\r\nevidently resorted to external aid. To those who undertook to name the\r\nman who dictated stories of the ancients to Mahomet day and night, he\r\nreplied that the individual whom they had in mind was a foreigner,\r\nwhereas the Koran was in pure Arabic. This was obviously a quibble, for\r\nit was scarcely asserted that he delivered the matter dictated to him\r\nwithout alteration. The purity of the Arabic also appears to have been\r\nvery questionable; for several expressions appear to be Ethiopic rather\r\nthan Arabic, and the person whom the Meccans had in mind is likely to\r\nhave been an Abyssinian Christian, since the Christian technicalities of\r\nthe Koran are mainly derived from the Ethiopic Gospels and Acts. On one\r\noccasion when some questions suggested by learned foreigners had been\r\npropounded to the Prophet he required a fortnight's delay before the\r\nrevelation which solved them came; the matter contained in his reply was\r\ncertainly such as required research. His sources of information seem at\r\nall times to have been legendary rather than canonical; and the\r\ncommunity which seemed to his opponents to agree best with his views was\r\nthat of the Sabians or Mandaeans (qq.v.).\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that Mahomet first threatened the Meccans with\r\ntemporal punishment, and only when this threat failed to take effect\r\nresorted to the terrors of the Day of Judgment and the tortures of Hell;\r\nit seems however a mistake to distinguish between the two. These threats\r\nprovided the Prophet with his most powerful sermons. The boasts of\r\nincomparable eloquence which the Koran contains are evidence that his\r\noratorical power was effective with his audiences, since the more\r\nsuccessful among the Arabic poets talk of their compositions somewhat in\r\nthe same way. These discourses certainly led to occasional conversions,\r\nperhaps more frequently among women than men.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Exiles in Axum.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic war seems to have been due to the Prophet's increasing\r\nsuccess, which led to serious persecution of Mahomet's less influential\r\nfollowers, though, as has been seen, no blood could be shed in Mecca.\r\nAbu Talib, moreover, prevented him from being exiled, though he probably\r\nhad to endure many personal insults. Something however had to be done\r\nfor the persecuted Moslems, and (perhaps at the suggestion of his\r\nAbyssinian helper) Mahomet endeavoured to find a refuge for them in the\r\nrealm of Axum. Abyssinia was doubtless connected in every Meccan mind\r\nwith the \"Expedition of the Elephant\"; and such an alliance secured by\r\nMahomet was a menace to the existence of the Meccan community. A\r\ndeputation was therefore sent by the Meccan leaders to demand\r\nextradition of the exiles; and as chief of this expedition the future\r\nconqueror of Egypt, 'Amr b. al-'As (see 'AMR IBN EL-ASS), first figures\r\nin history. To frustrate his efforts Mahomet sent his cousin Ja'far\r\narmed with an exposition of the Prophet's beliefs and doctrines\r\nafterwards embodied in the Koran as the Sura of Mary (No. XIX.; though\r\nwith the addition of some anti-Christian matter). The original document\r\ncontained an account of the Nativity of Christ with various miracles not\r\nknown to either the canonical or even the apocryphal gospels which have\r\nbeen preserved, but which would be found edifying rather than unorthodox\r\nby a church one of whose most popular books is _The Miracles of the\r\nVirgin Mary_. To this there were added certain notices of Old Testament\r\nprophets. The Abyssinian king and his ecclesiastical advisers took the\r\nside of Mahomet and his followers, whom they appear to have regarded as\r\npersecuted Christians; and an attempt made probably by the astute 'Amr\r\nto embroil them with the Abyssinians on the difficult question of the\r\nNatures of Christ failed completely. There seems reason for thinking\r\nthat the Abyssinian king contemplated bringing back the exiles by force,\r\nbut was diverted from this purpose by frontier wars; meanwhile they were\r\nsafely harboured, though they seem to have suffered from extreme\r\npoverty. The want of an Abyssinian chronicle for this period is a\r\nserious disadvantage for the study of Islamic origins. The sequel shows\r\nthat regular correspondence went on between the exiles and those who\r\nremained in Mecca, whence the former were retained within the fold of\r\nIslam, with occasional though rare apostasies to Christianity.\r\n\r\nMahomet's diplomatic victory roused the Meccan leaders to fury, and they\r\ndecided on the most vigorous measures to which they could rise; Abu\r\nTalib, Mahomet's protector, and the clan which acknowledged him as\r\n_sheikh_, including the Prophet and his family, were blockaded in the\r\nquarter which they occupied; as in other sanctuaries, though blood might\r\nnot be shed, a culprit might be starved to death. That this did not\r\noccur, though the siege appears to have lasted some months at least, was\r\ndue to the weak good nature of the Meccans, but doubtless also to the\r\nfact that there were enlisted on Mahomet's side many men of great\r\nphysical strength and courage (as their subsequent careers proved), who\r\ncould with impunity defy the Meccan embargo. After a time however the\r\nbesieged found the situation intolerable, and any assistance which they\r\nmight have expected from the king of Axum failed to come. The course\r\nadopted by Mahomet was retractation of those of his utterances which had\r\nmost offended the Meccans, involving something like a return to\r\npaganism. A revelation came acknowledging the effectiveness of the\r\nMeccan goddesses as well as Allah, and the Meccans raised the siege.\r\nNews of the reconciliation reached the Abyssinian exiles and they\r\nproceeded to return.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the Arabian coast the dispute had recommenced.\r\nThe revelation was discovered to be a fabrication of the Devil, who, it\r\nappears, regularly interpolates in prophetic revelations; such at least\r\nis the apology preserved in the Koran, whence the fabricated verses have\r\nbeen expunged. Since our knowledge of this episode (regarded as the most\r\ndisgraceful in the Prophet's career) is fragmentary, we can only guess\r\nthat the Prophet's hand had once more been forced by the more earnest of\r\nhis followers, for whom any compromise with paganism was impossible. The\r\nexiles went back to Abyssinia; and about this time both Abu Talib and\r\nKhadija died, leaving the Prophet unprotected.\r\n\r\nHe fled to the neighbouring oasis of Taif, where wealthy Meccans had\r\npossessions, and where the goddess al-`Uzza was worshipped with special\r\nzeal--where she is said still to exist in the form of a block of stone.\r\nHe had but little success there in proselytizing, and indeed had to\r\ncease preaching; but he opened negotiations with various Meccan magnates\r\nfor a promise of protection in case of his return. This was at last\r\nobtained with difficulty from one Mot`im b. `Adi. It would appear that\r\nhis efforts were now confined to preaching to the strangers who\r\nassembled at or near Mecca for the ceremonies connected with the feasts.\r\nHe received in consequence some invitations to come and expound his\r\nviews away from Mecca, but had to wait some time before one came of a\r\nsort which he could wisely accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Flight to Yathrib.\r\n\r\nThe situation which led to Mahomet's Flight (_hijra_, anglicized\r\nincorrectly _hejira_, q.v.) was singularly favourable to Mahomet's\r\nenterprise, and utilized by him with extraordinary caution and skill. At\r\nthe palm plantation called Yathrib, afterwards known as _al-Medina_,\r\nMedina, \"the City\" (i.e. of the Prophet), there were various tribes, the\r\ntwo most important, called Aus and Khazraj, being pagan, and engaged in\r\nan internecine feud, while under their protection there were certain\r\nJewish tribes, whose names have come down to us as Qainuqa, Nadir and\r\nQuraiza--implying that the Israelites, as might be expected, imitated\r\nthe totem nomenclature of their neighbours. The memory of these\r\nIsraelites is exclusively preserved by the Moslem records; the main\r\nstream of Jewish history flowed elsewhere. In the series of combats\r\nbetween the Aus and Khazraj the former had generally been worsted; the\r\nJews, as usual, had avoided taking any active part in the fray. Finally,\r\nowing to an act of gross perfidy, they were compelled to fight in aid of\r\nthe Aus; and in the so-called battle of Bu`ath the Aus aided by the Jews\r\nhad won a victory, doubtless attributed to the God of the Jews. As has\r\nbeen seen, the divine name employed by Mahomet (_Rahman_) was one\r\nfamiliar to the Jews; and the Yathribites who visited Mecca at\r\nfeast-time were naturally attracted by a professed representative of\r\nal-Rahman. The first Yathribite converts appear to have been\r\nKhazrajites, and one As`ad, son of Zurarah, is the most prominent\r\nfigure. Their idea may have been in the first place to secure the aid of\r\nthe Israelitish Deity in their next battle with the Aus, and indeed the\r\nprimary object of their visit to Mecca is said to have been to request\r\nassistance for their war. For this the plan was substituted of inviting\r\nthe Prophet to come to Mecca as dictator, to heal the feud and restore\r\norder, a procedure to which Greek antiquity offers parallels. The new\r\nconverts were told to carry on secret propaganda in Yathrib with this\r\nend in view. At the next feast some of the rival faction embraced Islam.\r\nA trusty follower of Mahomet, Mus'ab b.'Umair, who resembled Mahomet in\r\npersonal appearance, was sent to Yathrib to assist in the work. The\r\ncorrespondence between this person and the Prophet would, if we\r\npossessed it, be of the greatest value for the study of Islamic\r\nantiquity. We first hear at this time of _the conditions of Islam_, i.e.\r\na series of undertakings into which the convert entered: namely, to\r\nabstain from adultery, theft, infanticide and lying, and to obey Mahomet\r\n_in licitis et honestis_. The wholesale conversion of Yathrib was\r\ndetermined by that of two chieftains, Usaid b. Huraith and Sa'd b.\r\nMu'adh, both Ausites. The example of these was quickly followed, and\r\niconoclasm became rife in the place. At the next Meccan feast a\r\ndeputation of seventy Yathribites brought Mahomet a formal invitation,\r\nwhich he accepted, after imposing certain conditions. The interviews\r\nbetween Mahomet and the Yathribites are known as the _'Aqabah_ (probably\r\nwith reference to a text of the Koran). The attitude of the Jews towards\r\nthe project appears to have been favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Refugees.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions imposed by Mahomet on his new adherents appears to\r\nhave been the protection and harbouring of the older proselytes, whom\r\nMahomet most wisely determined to send before him to Yathrib, where, in\r\nthe event of the Yathribite loyalty wavering, they could be counted on\r\nwith certainty. The welcome given these refugees (_muhajirun_), as they\r\nwere from this time known in contra-distinction to the helpers (_ansar_)\r\nor allies from Yathrib, is said to have been of the warmest; a Helper\r\nwith two wives would hand one over to a wifeless Refugee. A yet more\r\nimportant condition which preceded the Flight was readiness to fight men\r\nof all colours in defence of the faith.\r\n\r\nAlthough the transactions with the people of Yathrib had been carried on\r\nwith profound secrecy, the nature of Mahomet's contract with his new\r\nadherents was somewhat divulged to the Meccan magnates, and the danger\r\nof allowing an implacable enemy to establish himself on the high-road of\r\ntheir north-bound caravans flashed upon them. The rule which forbade\r\nbloodshed in the sacred city had at last to be suspended; but elaborate\r\nprecautions were to be taken whereby every tribe (except Mahomet's own\r\nclan) should have their share in the guilt, which would thus be spread\r\nover the whole community fairly. When the committee appointed to\r\nperpetrate the crime reached Mahomet's house, they found that it was too\r\nlate; Mahomet had already departed, leaving Ali in his bed.\r\n\r\nThe actual Flight from Mecca to Yathrib has naturally been a favourite\r\nsubject for romance, and indeed appears to have been executed with the\r\ngreatest cunning. Accompanied by Abu Bekr only, Mahomet took refuge in a\r\ncave of Mt Thaur, in the opposite direction to that which he intended to\r\ntake finally, and there remained for three days; provision had been made\r\nof every requisite, food, powerful camels, a trusty and competent guide.\r\nThe date at which he reached Kuba, on the outskirts of Yathrib, where\r\nthere was already some sort of Moslem oratory, is given as 8 Rabia I.,\r\nof the year A.H. 1; the fact that he arrived there on the Jewish Day of\r\nAtonement gives us the date September 20, 622. The Meccans, who had\r\nemployed professional trackers to hunt down the fugitives, proceeded to\r\nconfiscate the houses and goods of Mahomet and of his followers who had\r\nfled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mahomet as Despot of Yathrib.\r\n\r\nThe safe arrival of Mahomet at his destination marks the turning-point\r\nin his career, which now became one of almost unbroken success; his\r\nintellectual superiority over both friends and enemies enabling him to\r\nprofit by defeat little less than by victory. His policy appears to have\r\nbeen to bind his followers to himself and them to each other by every\r\npossible tie; he instituted brotherhoods between the Refugees and\r\nHelpers, which were to count as relationships for legal purposes, and\r\nhaving himself no sons, he contracted numerous marriages partly with the\r\nsame end in view; e.g. with the infant daughter of Abu Bekr, Ayesha\r\n('A'ishah), whose ability he appears to have discerned; and the\r\nunamiable Hafsa, daughter of Omar. Of his own daughters three were given\r\nto faithful allies, the one by whom his line is supposed to have been\r\ncontinued to our time, Fatima, was reserved for his cousin Ali. Owing to\r\nhis efforts the alliance between the Refugees and Helpers resisted\r\nnumerous attempts on the part of enemies to break it up, and only\r\ntowards the end of the Prophet's life, when he appeared to favour\r\nMeccans unduly, do we hear of any bitterness between the two\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Medina Community.\r\n\r\nThe population of Yathrib, or, as it may now be called, Medina, soon\r\ndivided into three groups: Mahomet's united followers; the Jews; and a\r\nparty known as the \"Hypocrites,\" i.e. professing Moslems, who were\r\nlukewarm, or disaffected, among whom the most prominent is `Abdallah b.\r\nUbayy, a Khazrajite chieftain, who is said to have himself aspired to be\r\ndespot of Yathrib, and who till nearly the end of Mahomet's career\r\nfigures somewhat as a leader of the opposition; of his importance there\r\nis no question, but the reason for it and the mode whereby he made it\r\nfelt are often obscure. It would seem that the pagans remaining in\r\nYathrib speedily adopted Islam after the Prophet's arrival, whence we\r\nhear little of serious opposition on their part. Coming in the capacity\r\nof prophet of the Israelitish God, Mahomet at first seems to have\r\ncourted alliance with the Jews, and to have been ready to adopt their\r\nsystem with very slight modifications--similar to those which, according\r\nto his opinion, Jesus had come to introduce. The Jews met these advances\r\nby submitting him to examination in the intricacies of the _Torah_, and,\r\nfinding him very poorly equipped, proceeded to denounce him as an\r\nimposter; one of his examiners is said to have even translated the\r\n_Torah_ into Arabic with a view of convicting him of ignorance and\r\nimposture. They are' further charged with exercising their magical arts\r\non the Prophet and his followers, and to have succeeded thereby in\r\nproducing barrenness among the Moslem women. Their conduct must not of\r\ncourse be judged by the statement of their enemies; it is however clear\r\nthat Mahomet soon found that there was no possibility of compromising\r\nwith them on religious questions, or of obtaining their loyal support;\r\nmeanwhile he discovered that they were incapable of united and\r\npersistent action, and useless as warriors except against each other. He\r\ntherefore resolved on their extermination. His ruthlessness in their\r\ncase compared with his patience and forbearance in the case of the\r\n\"Hypocrites\" was consistent with his principle (always faithfully\r\nobserved) that no inquiry was permissible into the motives of\r\nconversion, and with his division of mankind into the two antagonistic\r\nfactions Believers and Unbelievers. The latter principle, as will be\r\nseen, was somewhat modified before the end of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Development of Islam.\r\n\r\nMahomet's failure to effect a compromise with the Jews caused a reaction\r\nin his mind towards paganism, and after about a year's residence at\r\nMedina the direction of prayer, which had till then been towards\r\nJerusalem, was turned southward to the pagan temple at Mecca. With this\r\nchange we may perhaps couple the adoption of the name _Allah_ for the\r\nDeity; in the Moslem formula \"in the Name of Allah the Rahman the\r\nMerciful,\" the translation attached to the word _Rahman_, and the\r\nprefixing to it of the name _Allah_ furnish clear evidence of\r\ntheological transition, though the stages are not recorded; we know,\r\nhowever, that the Meccans approved of the name _Allah_, but objected to\r\nthe name _Rahman_. Prayer (_salat_), said to have been prescribed on the\r\noccasion of the Prophet's ascent into heaven after a miraculous journey\r\nfrom Mecca to Jerusalem, began to assume a stereotyped form in the place\r\nof assembly built by Mahomet immediately after his arrival; the\r\nattitudes of prayer in use among many communities (e.g. the Jewish\r\nstanding, the prostration of some Christian sects) were combined. In\r\ngeneral it was Mahomet's principle, while taking over a practice from\r\nsome other sect, to modify it so as to render the Moslem method\r\nabsolutely distinct; thus when a summons to prayer became requisite, a\r\nnew mode (by the voice of a crier called _muaddhin_ or _muezzin_) was\r\npreferred to the Christian hammer; a new sacred day was adopted, in lieu\r\nof the Jewish Saturday and the Christian Sunday, in the weekday on which\r\nhe had safely reached Kuba, Friday; but the sanctity was reduced to the\r\nactual time occupied by public worship. On the subject of food he was\r\nsatisfied with the regulations of the Council of Jerusalem, recorded in\r\nActs xv.; which were observed by few if any Christian sects. The\r\nprohibition of wine, which was enacted in A.H. 3, is said to have been\r\noccasioned by the riotous conduct of one of his followers when under the\r\ninfluence of liquor; Palgrave saw in it (perhaps with justice) a\r\ndeliberate attempt to prevent harmony between Moslems and Christians, in\r\nwhose most sacred rite wine is used. The Fast of Ramadan, in which food\r\nboth liquid and solid is forbidden from sunrise to sunset, is said to be\r\na pagan or semi-pagan institution; its importance for military training\r\nand discipline is not likely to have been overlooked by the Prophet.\r\nWhen the direction of prayer was altered, it is probable that Mahomet\r\nalready intended to introduce into his system the whole of the pagan\r\npilgrimage with its antique ceremonial (with, of course, a new\r\ninterpretation); before this he is supposed to have aimed at the\r\nabolition of the Ka`ba and all that appertained to it.\r\n\r\nThe difference between religious and civil law has never been recognized\r\nby Islamic jurists, whose manuals deal equally with the law of contract\r\nand the amount of the body to be washed before prayer; the Prophet's\r\nordinances on both subjects were suggested by the occasion in each case,\r\nand it would seem that the opinions of trusted advisers were regularly\r\nheard before a revelation was issued. Even when this had been done the\r\nordinance might be cancelled by an abrogating revelation; it being \"easy\r\nfor Allah\" to substitute for a text already revealed another that was\r\nbetter or at least as good.\r\n\r\nAs Islam began to spread outside the limits of Medina both conversion to\r\nIslam and persistence therein were reduced to simple tests; the\r\npronunciation of the double formula of belief in Allah and Mahomet was\r\nsufficient to indicate conversion, whilst payment of an income-tax,\r\ncalled by the Jewish names for alms (_zakat_ and _sadaqah_), was\r\nevidence of loyalty. This income-tax, of which the definite assessment\r\nperhaps belongs to a later period, was for the support of necessitous\r\nconverts--an element in the community whose presence accounts for the\r\nmode in which the development of the Islamic state proceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  First Campaigns of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nThe industries in which the Meccan Refugees had been engaged were not of\r\na sort which they could exercise at Medina, where the palm took the\r\nplace of the camel as the basis of society. Moreover the Prophet seems\r\nto have given some disastrous advice on the subject of palmiculture, and\r\nthereby to have accentuated the poverty of the place. He had, therefore,\r\nto find some fresh source of revenue in order to deal with this\r\ndifficulty, and one of the Helpers is said to have suggested the plan\r\nwhich he adopted, viz. of attacking the Meccan caravans. With this view\r\nhe organized a series of expeditions, taking the lead himself sometimes,\r\nwhile at others he gave it to one of his veteran followers; and at first\r\nonly Refugees took part in them. The leaders of the caravans, however,\r\nwere expert in evading attacks of this sort, which were doubtless\r\nregularly attempted by the desert tribes; and in the first year of his\r\ndespotism Mahomet did not score a single success of the kind intended.\r\nThe attempts were not wholly fruitless; for while on the one hand he\r\naccustomed his followers to campaigning, on the other he made a series\r\nof agreements with the chieftains of the tribes through whose territory\r\nthe caravans ordinarily passed. Finding continued failure intolerable,\r\nhe resolved to take advantage of his power to bind and to loose by\r\nsending an expedition of seven men under his cousin `Abdallah b. Jahsh\r\nto attack a caravan at the beginning of the sacred month Rajab, when, as\r\nraiding during such a season was unknown, success was practically\r\ncertain. The commander on this, the Nakhlah raid, was given sealed\r\norders, to be opened after two days' march; the men were then to be\r\ngiven the option of retiring, if they disapproved. Of this no one seems\r\ndefinitely to have availed himself, and the raid ended successfully, for\r\nconsiderable booty was captured, while of the four persons who escorted\r\nthe caravan two were made prisoners, one escaped, and one, `Amr b.\r\nal-Hadrami, was killed; he was the first person slain fighting against\r\nan Islamic force. The violation of the sacred month seems to have caused\r\nconsiderable scandal in Arabia, but led to no serious consequence; on\r\nthe other hand the shedding of blood created a feud between the people\r\nof Mecca and the Refugees, with whom the Meccans long declined to\r\nidentify the people of Medina. The fact that the man who had been killed\r\nwas a client, not a citizen, made no difference. The circumstance that\r\nbooty had been actually acquired appears to have helped the Prophet's\r\ncause very considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Attack on Meccan Caravan.\r\n\r\nBoth these consequences, the Meccan desire to avenge the blood that had\r\nbeen shed and the anxiety of the Medinese to take part in a successful\r\nraid, manifested themselves a few months later, when an expedition was\r\norganized by Mahomet to attack a caravan returning from Syria, which had\r\nescaped him the previous year. Many desired to take part in the raid,\r\nand finally some 300 persons were selected, including a large number of\r\n\"Helpers.\" The leader of the caravan learned somehow that an attack was\r\nbeing organized by Mahomet on a large scale, and sent to Mecca for aid,\r\nwhile hurrying home by forced marches. This is the first historical\r\nappearance of Abu Sofian (the leader of the caravan), who now for some\r\nyears played the part of president in the Meccan opposition to Mahomet,\r\nand whose son was destined to found the second Mahommedan dynasty (see\r\nCALIPHATE, B). The day before the battle to be fought at Badr, near the\r\npoint where the northern road leaves the coast to turn eastwards to\r\nMecca, the Moslem army learned that the Meccan succour (some 1000\r\nstrong) was near, but that the caravan had escaped. The Meccans, it is\r\nasserted, would have returned home now that their object was secured,\r\nbut the patrons of the man who had been killed in the former raid were\r\ncompelled to strike for vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe battle (Ramadan 19, A.H. 2, usually made to synchronize with March\r\n17, 624) ended in a complete victory for Mahomet, whose followers killed\r\nseventy of the enemy and took seventy prisoners--if we may trust what\r\nseem to be round numbers; it was attributed by him to divine\r\nco-operation, taking the form of an illusion wrought on the enemy, and\r\nthe despatch of a regiment of angels to the assistance of the Believers,\r\nwhile on the other hand the treachery of the Devil did mischief to the\r\nMeccans. The popular tradition attributed it to the prowess of some of\r\nMahomet's followers, especially his uncle Hamza and his cousin Ali. In\r\nthe narratives which have come down and which seem to be authentic the\r\nresult is amply accounted for by the excellence of the Moslem discipline\r\nand the complete absence of any on the Meccan side. Mahomet himself is\r\nsaid to have fainted at the first sight of blood, and to have remained\r\nduring the battle in a hut built for him to which swift camels were\r\ntied, to be used in case of a defeat; yet these accounts make him\r\nresponsible for the tactics, whilst assigning the credit for the\r\nstrategy to one Hobab b. al-Mondhir. Several of Mahomet's old enemies\r\nand friends of Meccan days perished on this occasion; notably one Abu\r\nJahl, his uncle, but represented as an implacable enemy; another hostile\r\nuncle, Abu Lahab, who is cursed in the Koran, was not present but died\r\nshortly after the battle.\r\n\r\nThe day is called in the Koran by a Syriac expression the \"Day of\r\nDeliverance,\" and both for internal and external politics it was of\r\nincalculable advantage to Islam. The booty and the ransoms of the\r\nprisoners provided the means for dealing with distress; the story of\r\nsupernatural aid soothed the feelings of the defeated Meccans and had a\r\ntendency to disarm resistance elsewhere; whilst Mahomet in the\r\npopularity acquired by his victory was able to strike forcibly at his\r\nenemies in Medina. One of the sequels to the victory was a series of\r\nassassinations whereby critics of his actions were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Taking of Mecca.\r\n\r\nThe defeat at Badr naturally led to efforts on the part of the Meccans\r\nto avenge their dead and besides to secure the commerce, by which they\r\nlived, from an enemy who was gradually getting all the seaboard that lay\r\nbetween Jeddah and Yanbo within his sphere of influence; and the year\r\nafter Badr (A.H. 3) Abu Sofian was able to lead a force said to be three\r\ntimes as great as that which had been defeated, and so numbering some\r\n3000 men, against Medina itself; part of it was under Khalid b.\r\nal-Walid, one of the greatest of Arab captains, afterwards conqueror of\r\nSyria. It is said that Mahomet's plan was to remain in Medina itself,\r\nand leave it to the Meccan commander to discover some way of taking the\r\nplace; but that his hand was forced by his more ardent followers.\r\nOthers, however, assign this advice to Abdallah b. Ubayy, and make the\r\nProphet anxious to fight from the first. A battle was in consequence\r\nfought under Mt Uhud (or Ohod), north-west of Medina, wherein Khalid\r\nsucceeded in inflicting a severe defeat on Mahomet's forces; his uncle\r\nHamza, hero of Badr, was killed on this occasion. Fortunately for the\r\nMoslems, the Meccans considered that they had finished their task when\r\nthey discovered that they had killed a number of the former equal to\r\nthose who had fallen at Badr on their own side; instead therefore of\r\npursuing their victory they went home. The immediate effect on Arabia\r\nappears to have been to dissipate the illusion that the Prophet could\r\ncount on supernatural assistance in his wars; and we hear of some blows\r\nbeing dealt him from outside. Meanwhile his relations towards the\r\nMedinese Jews had grown more and more hostile, and these are credited\r\nwith doing their best to rouse the Meccans to a sense of the danger\r\nwhich threatened them in the continuance of the Prophet's power, and in\r\ngeneral to stir up hostility against him in Arabia. Whether this part\r\nwas played by them or not, in the fifth year of the Prophet's stay at\r\nMedina a fresh invasion of the territory took place by a vast\r\nconfederate force of Meccans with their allies, the tribes Fazarah,\r\nAsad, Murrah, &c., to the number, it is said, of 10,000. This time the\r\nintention of the leaders was undoubtedly to stamp out Islam. For the\r\nfirst time in Arab warfare Mahomet resorted to the expedient of\r\ndefending his city by a trench, called by a Persian name, and suggested\r\nby a Persian convert. But he also employed agents to sow dissension\r\namong the confederates, and succeeded with this no less than with the\r\nother expedient. After a brief stay, and scarcely striking a blow, the\r\nconfederacy dispersed, leaving the Jews who still remained in Medina to\r\nthe summary vengeance of the Prophet. The want of records written from\r\nthe Meccan standpoint renders the abortiveness of this last attempt at\r\nstorming the Prophet's stronghold scarcely intelligible.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, however, the road towards the eventual taking of Mecca\r\nbecame easy, and we are told that such was the importance attached to\r\nthat city throughout Arabia that its acquisition meant for the Prophet\r\nthe acquisition of the whole peninsula. The next year (A.H. 6) he deemed\r\nit advisable to make a truce with the Meccans (the Truce of Hodaibiyah),\r\nwhereby he secured for his followers the right of performing the\r\npilgrimage in the following year; on this occasion he even consented to\r\nforgo his title \"Prophet of Allah,\" when the Meccans refused to sign a\r\ndeed in which it was employed, greatly to the scandal of his more\r\nearnest followers, including Omar; they were however too deeply\r\ncommitted to Islam to be able to defy the Prophet. When the pilgrimage\r\nwas performed (A.H. 7), Mahomet not only won important converts in the\r\npersons of Khalid and the no less able `Amr b. al-`As, but in general\r\nimpressed the population with the idea that his was the winning side. An\r\nexcuse was easily found for invading Mecca itself in the following year,\r\nwhen Abu Sofian took the opportunity of embracing Islam before it was\r\ntoo late. Very little resistance was now made by the Meccans, whose\r\nchiefs were already in Mahomet's camp, and Mahomet used his victory with\r\ngreat moderation; his proscription list was finally reduced to two. The\r\ntheory that all offences were cancelled by conversion was loyally\r\nobserved. Moreover the Prophet incurred the displeasure of his Medinese\r\nfriends by the anxiety which he displayed to soothe the feelings of his\r\nformer enemies and antagonists. The Medinese, however, prevailed upon\r\nhim to maintain their city as his political capital, while making Mecca\r\nthe religious centre of his system; and this arrangement accounts\r\nperhaps more than anything else for the persistence of the system amid\r\nso many dynastic changes.\r\n\r\nIn the main he appears to have introduced little alteration into the\r\ngovernment of Mecca, and it is said that he even declined to retaliate\r\non those who had confiscated the possessions of the Refugees. Even the\r\nKa`ba was left in the keeping of its former custodian, though of course\r\nits interior as well as its precincts were cleansed of all that could\r\noffend monotheists. In the following year the pilgrimage was for the\r\nfirst time conducted by a Moslem official, Abu Bekr. A proclamation was\r\nmade on that occasion, forbidding idolaters in future to take part in\r\nthe pilgrimage, and giving all Arabs who were not as yet converted four\r\nmonths' grace before force was to be brought to bear upon them. In the\r\nfollowing year Mahomet conducted the Pilgrimage himself. This solemn\r\noccasion (the \"Farewell Pilgrimage\") was also employed for the delivery\r\nof an important proclamation, wherein the Prophet declared that God had\r\ncompleted their religion. The principle whereon he specially insisted\r\nwas the brotherhood of Islam; but there is some difficulty in\r\nenucleating the original sermon from later additions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conquest of Arabia.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Mahomet's enterprise originally comprised the\r\nconversion of Mecca only, and that he thought of himself as sent to his\r\nfellow-citizens only, as had been the case with earlier prophets, whose\r\nmessage was for their \"brethren.\" His views took a somewhat different\r\ndirection after his brief exile to Taif, and the conquest of Arabia was\r\nin a way forced upon him in the course of his struggle with the Meccans.\r\nIt is not indeed perfectly clear by what process he arrived at the\r\nresolution to exclude paganism from Arabia; at first he appears to have\r\ntolerated it at Medina, and in some of his earlier contracts with\r\nneighbouring tribes he is represented as allowing it, though some of our\r\ntexts make him reserve to himself the right of enforcing Islam if he\r\nchose; only the Meccans were at first, according to the most authentic\r\ndocuments, excluded from all truce or treaty. At the battle of Badr he\r\nappears to have formulated the rule that no one might fight on his side\r\nwho had not embraced Islam; and when once he had won fame as a\r\nsuccessful campaigner, those who wished to share his adventures had to\r\npass the Islamic test. After the battle of Uhud (Ohod) we hear of a\r\ntribe demanding missionaries to instruct them in Islamic principles; and\r\nthough in the case recorded the demand was treacherous, the idea of\r\nsending missionaries appears not to have been unfamiliar even then,\r\nalbeit the number sent (70), if rightly recorded, implies that the\r\nProphet suspected the good faith of the applicants. After the taking of\r\nMecca, whereby the chief sanctuary at any rate of north Arabia had been\r\ncleared of all idolatrous associations, and consecrated to monotheism,\r\npaganism in general was conscious of being attacked; and the city had\r\nscarcely been brought under the new régime before the Prophet had to\r\nface a confederation of tribes called Hawazin and Thaqif. The battle\r\nwhich ensued, known as the Day of Honain, was near ending disastrously\r\nfor Islam; some of Mahomet's sturdiest followers fled; but the terrible\r\ndanger of a defeat in the neighbourhood of recently conquered Mecca\r\nroused the Prophet and Ali to heroism, and they saved the day.\r\nEmissaries were now sent far and wide demanding the destruction of\r\nidols, and only Taif appears to have made any considerable resistance;\r\nagainst this place for the first time the Prophet made use of siege\r\nartillery, such as was employed by the Byzantines; though compelled by\r\nthe bravery of the inhabitants to raise the siege, he was afterwards\r\nable to take the city by capitulation. It has been observed that here\r\nonly do we read of much attachment to the old deities; in most places\r\nthey were discarded with few regrets when once their impotence had been\r\nfound out. After the taking of Mecca and the victory of Honain there\r\nappears to have been a general desire, extending even to the extreme\r\nsouth of Arabia, to make the best terms with the conqueror so soon as\r\npossible; iconoclasm became general. Flatterers of various kinds,\r\nincluding poets, came to seek the favour of the sovereign; and a mock\r\nwar of words appears to have been substituted by some tribes for more\r\nserious fighting, to terminate in surrender. For warfare of his sort\r\nMahomet had a powerful helper in the poet Hassan b. Thabit, for whose\r\neffusions a pulpit was erected in the Medina mosque, and whose verses\r\nwere said to be inspired by the Holy Spirit; though, as has been seen,\r\nMahomet was not himself able to judge of their artistic merit. It was\r\nnot, however, found easy to enforce the payment of the alms on these new\r\nconverts; and this taxation caused an almost general revolt so soon as\r\nMahomet's death had been ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Plan of World-conquest.\r\n\r\nAlthough the central portions of the peninsula in Mahomet's time were\r\npractically independent, large portions of the north-west and south-east\r\nwere provinces of the Byzantine and Persian empires respectively, whence\r\nany scheme for the conquest of Arabia would necessarily involve the\r\nconqueror in war with these great powers. The conquest of Persia is said\r\nto have been contemplated by the Prophet as early as A.H. 5, when the\r\nfamous Trench was being dug; but it was not till the year A.H. 7, on the\r\neve of the taking of Mecca, that the Prophet conceived the idea of\r\nsending missives to all known sovereigns and potentates, promising them\r\nsafety if, but only if, they embraced Islam. The text of these letters,\r\nwhich only varied in the name of the person addressed, is preserved\r\n(doubtless faithfully) by the Moslem Oral Tradition; in the middle of\r\nthe last century a French explorer professed to discover in Egypt the\r\noriginal of one of them--addressed to the mysterious personage called\r\nthe Muqauqis (Mukaukis) of Egypt--and this, it appears, is still\r\npreserved amid other supposed relics of the Prophet in Constantinople,\r\nthough there is little reason for believing it to be genuine. The\r\nanecdotes dealing with the reception of these letters by their\r\naddressees are all fabulous in character. Two appear to have sent\r\nfavourable replies: the king of Axum, who now could send the exiles whom\r\nhe had so long harboured to their successful master; and the Egyptian\r\ngovernor, who sent Mahomet a valuable present, including two Coptic\r\nwomen for his harem. The emperor Heraclius is claimed as a secret\r\nconvert to Islam, on whom pressure had to be put by his advisers to\r\nconceal his convictions. The Persian king is said to have sent orders to\r\nhave Mahomet arrested; his messengers arrived in Medina, but were unable\r\nto carry out the commands of their master, who died while they were\r\nthere. Two of the letters are said to have had important results. One\r\nwas addressed to the Himyarite chiefs (called by the south Arabian\r\nappellation _qail_) in Yemen, and effected their conversion; another to\r\nthe governor of Bostra in Roman Arabia, who put the bearer of this\r\ninsolent message to death; a force was despatched by Mahomet immediately\r\nafterwards (beginning of A.H. 8) to avenge this outrage; and though the\r\nMoslems were defeated in their first encounter with the Byzantine forces\r\nat Mutah, they appear to have given a good account of themselves; it was\r\nhere that Ja`far, cousin of the Prophet, met his death. In A.H. 9 a\r\nsuccessful expedition was led by the Prophet himself northward, in\r\nwhich, though no Byzantine force was encountered, a considerable region\r\nwas withdrawn from the Byzantine sphere of influence, and made either\r\nIslamic or tributary to Islam. At the time of his death (of fever, after\r\na short illness) he was organizing an expedition for the conquest of\r\nSyria.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jewish and Christian Communities.\r\n\r\nThe Prophet claimed throughout that his revelation confirmed the Jewish\r\nand Christian Scriptures, and this claim is on the whole reasonable,\r\nthough his acquaintance with both was in the highest degree vague and\r\ninaccurate. Still he reproduced the Old Testament as faithfully as he\r\ncould, and though he patriotically endeavours to shed some lustre on his\r\nsupposed ancestor Ishmael, he does not appear to have questioned the\r\nBiblical theory according to which the founder of the north Arabian\r\nnations was the son of a slave girl. On neither the truth of the\r\nBiblical history and miracles nor the validity of the Mosaic legislation\r\ndoes he appear to have cast any doubt. He even allows that Israel was\r\nthe chosen people. The Gospel was known to him chiefly through\r\napocryphal and heretical sources, which cannot certainly be identified;\r\nbut he accepted the doctrine of the Virgin-birth, the miracles of\r\nhealing the sick and raising the dead, and the ascension; the\r\ncrucifixion and resurrection were clearly denied by the sect from whom\r\nhe had received his information, and rejected by him, though certainly\r\nnot because of any miracle which the latter involved. His quarrel with\r\nthe Jews at Medina appears to have been by no means of his own seeking,\r\nbut to have arisen unavoidably, owing to his particular view of his\r\noffice being such as they could not accept; and his attempt to\r\ndiscredit, not the Mosaic Law, but the form in which they presented it,\r\nwas an expedient to which he resorted in self-defence. An attempt was\r\nmade shortly after his arrival at Medina to settle the relations between\r\nthe two communities by a treaty, according to which, while their\r\nequality was guaranteed there should be little interference between the\r\ntwo; this, however, was found unworkable, and each victory of Mahomet\r\nover the Meccans was followed by violent measures against the Medinese\r\nIsraelites. When experience had shown him their military incompetence he\r\nappears to have been unable to resist the temptation to appropriate\r\ntheir goods for the benefit of his followers; and his attack on the\r\nflourishing Jewish settlement of Khaibar, after the affair of\r\nHodaibiyah, appears to have been practically unprovoked, and designed to\r\nsatisfy his discontented adherents by an accession of plunder. Yet the\r\nconsciousness that this process was economically wasteful suggested to\r\nhim an idea which Islamic states are only now abandoning, viz. that of a\r\ntolerated caste, who should till the soil and provide sustenance for the\r\nBelievers who were to be the fighting caste. Whereas then his former\r\nplan in dealing with Israelites had been to banish or massacre, he now\r\nleft the former owners of Khaibar (who had survived the capture of the\r\nplace) in possession of the soil, of whose produce they were to pay a\r\nfixed proportion to the Islamic state. The same principle was adopted in\r\nthe case of later conquests of Jewish settlements.\r\n\r\nDisputes with Christians occur somewhat later in the Prophet's career\r\nthan those with Jews, for neither at Mecca nor Medina were the former to\r\nbe found in any numbers; individuals are likely to have been found in\r\nboth cities, and we hear of one Medinese \"Abu'Amir the Monk,\" who after\r\nMahomet's arrival at Medina branded him as an impostor, and, going\r\nhimself into exile, made many an abortive attempt to discredit and\r\ninjure Mahomet's cause. The notices of him are meagre and obscure.\r\nMahomet's manifesto to the world, about the time of the taking of\r\nKhaibar, appears to represent his definite breach with Christianity; and\r\nwhen in the \"year of the embassies\" the Christians of Najran sent a\r\ndeputation to him, they found that the breach between the two systems\r\nwas not to be healed. Of the three alternatives open to\r\nthem--conversion, internecine war, and tribute, they chose the last. The\r\nChristian tribes of north Arabia showed greater inclination towards the\r\nfirst. The Prophet's policy was to give Christians lighter terms than\r\nJews, and though the Koran reflects the gradual adoption by the Prophet\r\nof an attitude of extreme hostility to both systems, its tone is on the\r\nwhole far more friendly to the former than to the latter. Some other\r\ncommunities are mentioned in the Koran, but merely in casual allusions:\r\nthus we know that Mahomet's sympathy was with the Byzantines in their\r\nstruggle with Persia, but in his most tolerant utterance the Magians or\r\nMazdians as well as the Sabians (with whom his followers were identified\r\nby the Meccans) are mentioned with respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mahomet's Administration.\r\n\r\nThe financial requirements of Mahomet's state were of the simplest kind,\r\nfor there is no trace of any form of governmental department having been\r\ninstituted by him, even when he was master of the peninsula; nor can we\r\nname any permanent officials in his employ except his _muaddhin_ Bilal,\r\nand perhaps his court-poet Hassan. A staff of scribes was finally\r\nrequired both to take down his revelations and to conduct\r\ncorrespondence; but although he encouraged the acquisition of penmanship\r\n(indeed some of the prisoners at Badr are said to have been allowed to\r\nransom themselves by teaching it to the Medinese), we know of no regular\r\nsecretaries in his employ. As despot of Medina he combined the functions\r\nof legislator, administrator, general and judge; his duties in the last\r\nthree capacities were occasionally delegated to others, as when he\r\nappointed a governor of Medina during his absence, or leaders for\r\nexpeditions, with provision for successors in case of their falling, but\r\nwe hear of no permanent or regular delegation of them. Till near the end\r\nof his career at Medina he maintained the principle that migration to\r\nthat city was a condition of conversion; but when, owing to the\r\nextension of his power, this was no longer practicable, his plan was in\r\nthe main to leave the newly converted communities to manage their\r\ninternal affairs as before, only sending occasional envoys to discharge\r\nspecial duties, especially instruction in the Koran and the principles\r\nof Islam, and to collect the Alms; quite towards the end of his life he\r\nappears to have sent persons to the provinces to act as judges, with\r\ninstructions to judge according to the Koran, and where that failed,\r\n_the practice_ (_sunna_), i.e. the practice of the community, for which\r\na later generation substituted the practice of the Prophet. There were,\r\ntherefore, no regular payments to permanent officials; and the taxation\r\ncalled _Alms_, which developed into an income-tax, but was at first a\r\ndemand for voluntary contributions, was wholly for the support of the\r\npoor Moslems; it might not be used for the maintenance of the state,\r\ni.e. Mahomet and his family. For them, and for public business, e.g. the\r\npurchase of war material and gratuities to visitors, provision was made\r\nout of the booty, of which Mahomet claimed one-fifth (the chieftain's\r\nshare had previously, we are told, been one-fourth), while the\r\nremainder--or at least the bulk of it--was distributed among the\r\nfighting men; the Prophet appears to have prided himself on the justice\r\nof his distribution on these occasions, and doubtless won popularity\r\nthereby, though we hear occasionally of grumbling; for difficulties\r\noccurred when a defeated tribe embraced Islam, and so could claim\r\nequality with their conquerors, or when portions of the spoil were\r\nirregularly employed by Mahomet to allay resentment: the persons whose\r\nallegiance was thus purchased were euphemistically termed \"those whose\r\nhearts were united.\" What afterwards proved the main source of revenue\r\nin Islamic states dates from the taking of Khaibar; for the rent paid to\r\nthe state by tolerated communities for the right to work their land\r\ndeveloped long after Mahomet's time into a poll-tax for Unbelievers (see\r\nCALIPHATE, e.g. B. § 8 and MAHOMMEDAN INSTITUTIONS), and a land-tax for\r\nall owners of land. Immediately after the taking of Khaibar certain\r\ncommunities, of which the most notable was Fadak, sent tribute before\r\nthey had been attacked and reduced; their land was regarded by Mahomet\r\nas his private domain, but after his death it was withdrawn from his\r\nheirs by his successor Abu Bekr, in virtue of a maxim that Prophets left\r\nno inheritance, which in the opinion of Fatima was contrary to Koranic\r\ndoctrine, and invented by Ayesha's father expressly for the purpose of\r\nexcluding her and her husband from their rights; and this is likely to\r\nhave been the case.\r\n\r\nAs a military organizer Mahomet, as has been seen, was anxious to adopt\r\nthe most advanced of contemporary methods, and more than once is said to\r\nhave scandalized the Arabs by foreign innovations, as at a later time\r\nthe Moslem chiefs who first used gunpowder scandalized their\r\nco-religionists. The unit in his armies seems to have been, as of old,\r\nthe tribe, under its natural leader; that he introduced no more\r\nscientific division, and nothing like a hierarchy of officers was\r\nperhaps due to the difficulty of reconciling such a system with the\r\nequality of all Moslems.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the Koran only assumed the character of a civil code\r\nas the need for one arose; and for some time after Mahomet's arrival at\r\nMedina old-fashioned methods of settling disputes continued in use, and\r\ndoubtless in accordance with precedent where such was known. For\r\ndifficult cases, even in Arab opinion, divine inspiration was required;\r\nand since Mahomet naturally claimed to be in sole enjoyment of this, his\r\nutterances soon became the unique source of law, though he did not at\r\nfirst think of organizing a code. Such a plan is said to have occurred\r\nto him, and he even wished to dictate a code upon his deathbed; but his\r\nfriends supposed or professed to suppose him to be delirious. A table\r\nregulating the \"Alms\" was left by him, it is said, in the possession of\r\nAbu Bekr; but other traditions assign another origin to this document.\r\n\r\nJust as there were no regular officials for the arrangement of business,\r\nso there were none for its execution; when punishment was to be\r\nadministered, any follower of Mahomet might be called upon to administer\r\nit. In the case of the massacre of the Banu Quraizah care was taken to\r\nsee that some of the heads were struck off by their former allies, in\r\norder that the latter might be unable at any time to bring a demand for\r\nvengeance. The Prophet hoped by the mere terror of his name to make\r\ncomplete security reign throughout Arabia, and there is no evidence that\r\nany system of policing either it or even Medina occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Domestic Life.\r\n\r\n  Until the death of Khadija the Prophet's private life seems to have\r\n  been normal and happy, for though the loss of his sons in infancy is\r\n  said to have earned him a contemptuous epithet, he was fortunate in\r\n  his adoption of Zaid b. Harithah, apparently a prisoner ransomed by\r\n  Khadija or one of her relatives, who appears as dutiful almost to\r\n  excess and competent in affairs. The marriages of his daughters seem\r\n  all to have been happy, with, curiously, the exception of that between\r\n  Fatima and Ali. His domestic troubles, to which an unreasonable amount\r\n  of space seems to be devoted, even in the Koran, began after the\r\n  Migration, when, probably in the main for political reasons, he\r\n  instituted a royal harem. One of these political motives was the\r\n  principle which long survived, that the conquest of a state was\r\n  consummated by possession of the former monarch's wife, or daughter;\r\n  another, as has been seen, the desire to obtain the securest possible\r\n  hold on his ministers. In his marriage with the daughter of his\r\n  arch-enemy Abu Sofian, before the latter's conversion, we can see a\r\n  combination of the two. Few, therefore, of these marriages occasioned\r\n  scandal; yet public morality seemed to be violated when the Prophet\r\n  took to himself the wife of his adopted son Zaid, whose name has in\r\n  consequence the honour of mention in the Koran in the revelation which\r\n  was delivered in defence of this act. Its purpose was, according to\r\n  this, to establish the difference between adoptive and real filiation.\r\n  Serious trouble was occasioned by a charge of adultery brought against\r\n  the youthful favourite Ayesha, and this had to be refuted by a special\r\n  revelation; the charge, which was backed up apparently by Ali, seems\r\n  to have been connected with some deeper scheme for causing dissension\r\n  between the Prophet and his friends. Yet another revelation is\r\n  concerned with a mutiny in the harem organized by Omar's daughter\r\n  Hafsa, owing to undue favour shown to a Coptic concubine (Mary, mother\r\n  of a son called Ibrahim, who died in infancy; his death was marked by\r\n  an eclipse, January 27, 632); and various details of factions within\r\n  the harem are told us by Mahomet's biographers.\r\n\r\n  Of the members of this harem the only prominent one is Ayesha, married\r\n  to the Prophet shortly after the Flight, when she had scarcely passed\r\n  the period of infancy, but who appears to have been gifted with\r\n  astuteness and ambition that were quite beyond her years, and who\r\n  maintained her ascendancy over the Prophet in spite of the fact that\r\n  many carping criticisms of his revelations are attributed to her. Some\r\n  of this may have been due to the obligations (including pecuniary\r\n  obligations) under which her father had laid Mahomet; but her\r\n  reputation seems to have been greatly enhanced by the sending down of\r\n  a revelation to exonerate her (A.H. 6), for which she thanked God and\r\n  not the Prophet. Each accession to the harem rendered the building of\r\n  a house or room necessary for the newcomer's accommodation; a fact in\r\n  which Robertson Smith perhaps rightly saw a relic of the older system\r\n  whereby the tent was the property of women. The trouble noticed above\r\n  seems to have arisen from the want of a similar arrangement in the\r\n  case of slave girls, with whom Mahomet's system permits cohabitation.\r\n  When Mahomet, whether in consequence of the fatigue incurred by the\r\n  \"Farewell Pilgrimage,\" or, as others thought, by the working of some\r\n  poison put into his food some years before by a Jewess of Khaibar, was\r\n  attacked by the illness which proved fatal, it was to the house of\r\n  Ayesha that he was transferred (from that of another wife) to be\r\n  nursed; and he apparently died in the arms of the favourite, on whose\r\n  statements we have to rely for what we know of his last hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    General Characteristics.\r\n\r\n  The traditional description of Mahomet is \"of middle height, greyish,\r\n  with hair that was neither straight nor curly; with a large head,\r\n  large eyes, heavy eyelashes, reddish tint in the eyes, thick-bearded,\r\n  broad-shouldered, with thick hands and feet\"; he was in the habit of\r\n  giving violent expression to the emotions of anger and mirth. The\r\n  supposition that he at any time suffered from physical weakness seems\r\n  absolutely refuted by his career as a leader of difficult, dangerous\r\n  and wearisome expeditions, from his migration to Medina until his\r\n  death; indeed, during his last years he exhibited a capacity for both\r\n  physical and intellectual activity which implies a high degree of both\r\n  health and strength; and without these the previous struggle at Mecca\r\n  could scarcely have been carried on. The supposition that he was\r\n  liable to fits (epileptic or cataleptic) was intended to account for\r\n  certain of the phenomena supposed to accompany the delivery of\r\n  revelations; some of these however rest on very questionable\r\n  authority: and the greater number of the revelations give evidence of\r\n  careful preparation rather than spontaneity.\r\n\r\n  The literary matter ascribed to the Prophet consists of (1) the Koran\r\n  (q.v.); (2) certain contracts, letters and rescripts preserved by his\r\n  biographers; (3) a number of sayings on a vast variety of topics,\r\n  collected by traditionalists. The references in the Koran to a form of\r\n  literature called \"Wisdom\" (_hikmah_) suggest that even in the\r\n  Prophet's time some attempts had been made to collect or at least\r\n  preserve some of the last; the general uncertainty of oral tradition\r\n  and the length of time which elapsed before any critical treatment of\r\n  it was attempted, and the variety of causes, creditable and\r\n  discreditable, which led to the wilful fabrication of prophetic\r\n  utterances, render the use to which No. 3 can be put very limited.\r\n  Thus the lengthy description of the journey to heaven which Sprenger\r\n  was inclined to accept as genuine is regarded by most critics as a\r\n  later fabrication. It is very much to be regretted that the number of\r\n  _pièces justificatives_ (No. 2) quoted by the biographers is so small,\r\n  and that for these oral tradition was preferred to a search for the\r\n  actual documents, some of which may well have been in existence when\r\n  the earliest biographies were written. Their style appears to have\r\n  been plain and straightforward, though the allusions which they\r\n  contain are not always intelligible.\r\n\r\n  In his personal relations with men Mahomet appears to have been able\r\n  to charm and impress in an extraordinary degree, whence we find him\r\n  able to control persons like Omar and Khalid, who appear to have been\r\n  self-willed and masterful, and a single interview seems to have been\r\n  sufficient to turn many an enemy into a devoted adherent. Cases\r\n  (perhaps legendary) are quoted of his being able by a look or a word\r\n  to disarm intending assassins.\r\n\r\n  Although the titles which he took were religious in character, and his\r\n  office might not be described as sovereignty, his interests appear to\r\n  have lain far more in the building up and maintenance of empire than\r\n  in ecclesiastical matters. Thus only can we account for the violent\r\n  and sudden changes which he introduced into his system, for his\r\n  temporary lapse into paganism, and for his ultimate adoption of the\r\n  cult of the Black Stone, which, it is said, gave offence to some of\r\n  his sincere adherents (e.g. Omar), and seems hard to reconcile with\r\n  his tirades against fetish-worship. The same is indicated by his\r\n  remarkable doctrine that the utterance of the creed constituted a\r\n  Moslem and not its cordial acceptance, and his practice of at times\r\n  buying adhesion. Even an historian so favourable to the Prophet as\r\n  Prince Caetani recognizes that ultimately what he regarded as most\r\n  important was that his subjects should pay their taxes. And in general\r\n  his system was not favourable to fanaticism (_al-ghulu fi`l-din_); he\r\n  repeatedly gave permission for concealment of faith when the\r\n  profession of it was dangerous; he took care to avoid institutions\r\n  which, like the Jewish Sabbath, interfered seriously with military\r\n  expeditions and the conduct of business, and permitted considerable\r\n  irregularity in the matters of prayer and fasting when circumstances\r\n  rendered it desirable. In his theory that Koranic texts could be\r\n  abrogated he made wise provision against the danger of hasty\r\n  legislation, though some of its usefulness was frustrated by his\r\n  failure to provide for such abrogation after his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mahomet's Reforms.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, Mahomet claimed to introduce a wholly new\r\ndispensation, and a maxim of his law is that Islam cancels all that\r\npreceded it, except, indeed, pecuniary debts; it is not certain that\r\neven this exception always held good. Hence his system swept away a\r\nnumber of practices (chiefly connected with the camel) that were\r\nassociated with pagan superstitions. The most celebrated of these is the\r\narrow-game, a form of gambling for shares in slaughtered camels, to\r\nwhich poetic allusions are very frequent. More important than this was\r\nhis attitude towards the blood-feud, or system of tribal responsibility\r\nfor homicide (whether intentional or accidental), whereby one death\r\nregularly led to protracted wars, it being considered dishonourable to\r\ntake blood-money (usually in the form of camels) or to be satisfied with\r\none death in exchange. This system he endeavoured to break down, chiefly\r\nby sinking all earlier tribal distinctions in the new brotherhood of\r\nIslam; but also by limiting the vengeance to be demanded to such as was\r\nno more than the equivalent of the offence committed, and by urging the\r\nacceptance of money-compensation instead, or complete forgiveness of the\r\noffence. The remembrance of pre-Islamic quarrels was visited by him with\r\ncondign punishment on those who had embraced Islam; and though it was\r\nlong before the tribal system quite broke down, even in the great cities\r\nwhich rose in the new provinces, and the old state of things seems to\r\nhave quickly been resumed in the desert, his legislation on this subject\r\nrendered orderly government among Arabs possible.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to this is the abolition of infanticide, which is\r\ncondemned even in early Suras of the Koran. The scanty notices which we\r\nhave of the practice are not altogether consistent; at times we are told\r\nthat it was confined to certain tribes, and consisted in the burying\r\nalive of infant daughters; at other times it is extended to a wider\r\narea, and said to have been carried out on males as well as females.\r\nAfter the taking of Mecca this prohibition was included among the\r\nconditions of Islam.\r\n\r\nIn the laws relating to women it seems likely that he regulated current\r\npractice rather than introduced much that was actually new, though, as\r\nhas been seen, he is credited with giving them the right to inherit\r\nproperty; the most precise legislation in the Koran deals with this\r\nsubject, of which the main principle is that the share of the male\r\nequals that of two females. Our ignorance of the precise nature of the\r\nmarriage customs prevalent in Arabia at the rise of Islam renders it\r\ndifficult to estimate the extent to which his laws on this subject were\r\nan improvement on what had been before. The pre-Islamic family, unless\r\nour records are wholly misleading, did not differ materially from the\r\nIslamic; in both polygamy and concubinage were recognized and normal;\r\nand it is uncertain that the text which is supposed to limit the number\r\nof wives to four was intended to have that meaning. The \"condition of\r\nIslam\" whereby adultery was forbidden is said to have been ridiculed at\r\nthe time, on the ground that this practice had never been approved. Yet\r\nit would seem that certain forms of promiscuity had been tolerated,\r\nthough the subject is obscure. Against these services we must set the\r\nabrogation of some valuable practices. His unfortunate essay in\r\nastronomy, whereby a calendar of twelve lunar months, bearing no\r\nrelation to the seasons, was introduced, was in any case a retrograde\r\nstep; but it appears to have been connected with the abrogation of the\r\nsanctity of the four months during which raiding had been forbidden in\r\nArabia, which, as has been seen, he was the first to violate. He also,\r\nas has been noticed, permitted himself a slight amount of bloodshed in\r\nMecca itself, and that city perhaps never quite recovered its sacrosanct\r\ncharacter. Of more serious consequences for the development of the\r\ncommunity was his encouragement of the shedding of kindred blood in the\r\ncause of Islam; the consequences of the abrogation of this taboo seem to\r\nhave been felt for a great length of time. His assassinations of enemies\r\nwere afterwards quoted as precedents in books of Tradition. No less\r\nunfortunate was the recognition of the principle whereby atonement could\r\nbe made for oaths. On the question how far the seclusion of women was\r\nenjoined or countenanced by him different views have been held.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sources.\r\n\r\n  Besides the contemporary documents enumerated above (Koranic texts,\r\n  rescripts and authentic traditions) many of the events were celebrated\r\n  by poets, whose verses were ostensibly incorporated in the standard\r\n  biography of Ibn Ishaq; in the abridgment of that biography which we\r\n  possess many of these are obelized as spurious, and, indeed, what we\r\n  know of the procedure of those who professed to collect early poetry\r\n  gives us little confidence in the genuineness of such odes. A few,\r\n  however, seem to stand criticism, and the _diwan_ (or collection of\r\n  poems) attributed to Hassan b. Thabit is ordinarily regarded as his.\r\n  Though they rarely give detailed descriptions of events, their\r\n  attestation is at times of value, e.g. for the story that the bodies\r\n  of the slain at Badr were cast by the Prophet into a pit. Besides\r\n  this, the narratives of eyewitnesses of important events, or of those\r\n  who had actually taken part in them, were eagerly sought by the second\r\n  generation, and some of these were committed to writing well before\r\n  the end of the 1st century. The practice instituted by the second\r\n  Caliph, of assigning pensions proportioned to the length of time in\r\n  which the recipient had been a member of the Islamic community, led to\r\n  the compilation of certain rolls, and to the accurate preservation of\r\n  the main sequence of events from the commencement of the mission, and\r\n  for the detailed sequence after the Flight, which presently became an\r\n  era (beginning with the first month of the year in which the Flight\r\n  took place). The procedure whereby the original dates of the events\r\n  (so far as they were remembered) were translated into the Moslem\r\n  calendar--for something of this sort must have been done--is unknown,\r\n  and is unlikely to have been scientific.\r\n\r\n  Mahomet's conduct being made the standard of right and wrong, there\r\n  was little temptation to \"whitewash\" him, although the original\r\n  biography by Ibn Ishaq appears to have contained details which the\r\n  author of the abridgment omitted as scandalous. The preservation of so\r\n  much that was historical left little room for the introduction of\r\n  miraculous narrations; these therefore either belong to the obscure\r\n  period of his life or can be easily eliminated; thus the narratives of\r\n  the Meccan council at which the assassination of Mahomet was decided,\r\n  of the battles of Badr, Uhud and Honain, and the death of Sad`b. Mu\r\n  `adh, would lose nothing by the omission of the angels and the devil,\r\n  though a certain part is assigned the one or the other on all these\r\n  occasions. We should have expected biographies which were published\r\n  when the `Abbasids were reigning to have falsified history for the\r\n  purpose of glorifying `Abbas, their progenitor; the very small extent\r\n  to which this expectation is justified is a remarkable testimony to\r\n  their general trustworthiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RELATIVES OF THE PROHET[1]\r\n\r\n  1. _Family of `Abd al-Mottalib_, Mahomet's maternal\r\n  grandfather:--*`Abbas (d.

These gave rise to the classical works on\r\n  the _Evidences of Mohammed's Mission_ by Abu Nu`aim (d. A.D.\r\n  1012-1013) and Baihaqi (d. A.D. 1066).\r\n\r\n  _Lives of the Prophet_ ([+] indicates that the work is lost);\r\n  [+]`Urwah b. Zubair (d. 712-713); [+]Musa b. `Ukbah (d. 758-759);\r\n  [+]Mohammed b.

Many more\r\n  writers on this subject are enumerated in the _Fihrist_, cf.\r\n  Sprenger's _Leben Muhammads_, iii. 54-76.\r\n\r\n  Among the most popular compilers of later times are: Ibn al-Athir\r\n  (q.v.) al Jazari, the historian (d. 1233); Ahmad b. Ali al Kastalani\r\n  (d. A.D. 1517), whose _al-Mawahib al-Laduniyyah_ was published with\r\n  commentary (Cairo, 1278); Hosain b.

A.D. 1634), whose biography called\r\n  _Insan al-`uyun_ was published in Cairo, A.H. 1292. To these must be\r\n  added all the collections of Tradition.\r\n\r\n  _Modern Authorities._--The critical study of the Life of Mahomet\r\n  begins in Europe with the publication by Th. Gagnier in 1723 of the\r\n  Life by Abulfeda (q.v.). Presently there appeared an apologetic\r\n  biography by Henri Cmte. de Boulainvilliers (2nd ed., Amsterdam,\r\n  1731), to which Gagnier replied in 1732 (_La Vie de Mahomet,\r\n  traduite_, &c. ibid.). The next considerable advance in the treatment\r\n  of the subject is marked by the biography of G. Weil (_Muhammed der\r\n  Prophet_, Stuttgart, 1843), which is wholly without religious bias;\r\n  the popular life by Washington Irving (London, 1849) is based on this.\r\n  That by J. L. Merrick (the _Life and Religion of Mohammed_, Boston,\r\n  U.S.A., 1850) rests on Shi`ite sources. The search for MSS. in India\r\n  conducted by A. Sprenger led to the discovery of fresh material, which\r\n  was utilized by Sprenger himself in his unfinished _Life of Mohammad_\r\n  (Pt. 1, Allahabad, 1851), and his more elaborate _Das Leben und die\r\n  Lehre des Mohammad_ (Berlin, 1861-1865), and by Sir William Muir in\r\n  his _Life of Mahomet_, (London, 1858-1861) 4 vols.: afterwards\r\n  abridged in one volume and reprinted. These are still the standard\r\n  treatises on the subject; the pro-Christian bias of Muir is very\r\n  marked, while Sprenger has hazarded numerous conjectures on subjects\r\n  with which he had little familiarity. The biography by S. W. Koelle,\r\n  _Mohammed and Mohammedanism_ (London, 1889), is pro-Christian, the\r\n  popular work of Syed Ameer Ali _The Spirit of Islam_, (London, 1896)\r\n  an apology for Mahommedanism. Later treatises, resting on original\r\n  authorities, are those by H. Grimme _Mohamed_, (Münster, 1892, and\r\n  Munich, 1904), F. Buhl, _Mohameds Liv_ (Copenhagen, 1903--Danish:\r\n  since translated into German), D. S. Margoliouth _Mohammed and the\r\n  Rise of Islam_ (N.Y., 1905, &c.), and Prince Caetani _Annali del\r\n  Islam_, i. ii. (Milan, 1905-1907). For the direction of public opinion\r\n  in Mahomet's favour the Lecture on _The Hero as Prophet_ in Carlyle's\r\n  _Heroes and Hero-worship_ (London, 1846) was singularly effective; his\r\n  views were enforced by R. Bosworth Smith _Mohammed and Mohammedanism_,\r\n  (London, 1873, &c.). A somewhat similar line was taken in France by J.\r\n  Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire, _Mahomet et le Coran_, (Paris, 1865), while\r\n  the _Vie de Mahomet d'après la Tradition_ of E. Lamairesse and G.\r\n  Dujarric (Paris, 1897) is written entirely from the Moslem standpoint.\r\n\r\n  See further CALIPHATE, _ad init._; MAHOMMEDAN INSTITUTIONS; MAHOMMEDAN\r\n  LAW; MAHOMMEDAN RELIGION.

His family, known as excellent\r\nboat-builders, claimed to be _Ashraf_ (or _Sherifs_), i.e. descendants\r\nof Mahomet. His father was a _fiki_ or religious teacher, and Mahommed\r\nAhmed devoted himself early to religious studies. When about twenty\r\nyears old he went to live on Abba Island on the White Nile about 150 m.\r\nabove Khartum. He first acquired fame by a quarrel with the head of the\r\nbrotherhood which he had joined, Mahommed asserting that his master\r\ncondoned transgression of the divine law. After this incident many\r\ndervishes (religious mendicants) gathered round the young sheikh, whose\r\nreputation for sanctity speedily grew. He travelled secretly through\r\nKordofan, where (with ample justification) he denounced to the villagers\r\nthe extortion of the tax-gatherer and told of the coming of the mahdi\r\nwho should deliver them from the oppressor. He also wrote a pamphlet\r\nsummoning true believers to purify their religion from the defilements\r\nof the \"Turks\" i.e. the Egyptian officials and all non-native\r\ninhabitants of the Sudan. The influence he gained at length aroused the\r\nanxiety of the authorities, and in May 1881 a certain Abu Saud, a\r\nnotorious scoundrel, was sent to Abba Island to bring the sheikh to\r\nKhartum. Abu Saud's mission failed, and Mahommed Ahmed no longer\r\nhesitated to call himself al-Mahdi al Montasir, \"The Expected Guide.\" In\r\nAugust he defeated another force sent to Abba Island to arrest him, but\r\nthereafter deemed it prudent to retire to Jebel Gedir, in the Nuba\r\ncountry south of Kordofan, where he was soon at the head of a powerful\r\nforce; and 6000 Egyptian troops under Yusef Pasha, advancing from\r\nFashoda, were nearly annihilated in June 1882. By the end of 1882 the\r\nwhole of the Sudan south of Khartum was in rebellion, with the exception\r\nof the Bahr-el-Ghazal and the Equatorial Provinces. In January 1883 El\r\nObeid, the capital of Kordofan, was captured. In the November following\r\nHicks Pasha's force of 10,000 men was destroyed at Kashgil, and in the\r\nsame year the mahdi's lieutenant, Osman Digna, raised the tribes in the\r\neastern Sudan, and besieged Sinkat and Tokar, near Suakin, routing\r\nGeneral Valentine Baker's force of 2500 men at El Teb in February 1884.\r\nThe operations undertaken by Great Britain in face of this state of\r\naffairs are narrated under EGYPT: _Military Operations_. It need only be\r\nadded that General Gordon (q.v.) was besieged at Khartum by the mahdi\r\nand was killed there when the town was captured by the mahdists on the\r\n25th-26th of January 1885. The mahdi himself died at Omdurman a few\r\nmonths later (June 22, 1885), and was succeeded in power by his khalifa\r\nAbdullah.\r\n\r\nWhen he announced his divine mission Mahommed Ahmed adopted the Shi`ite\r\ntraditions concerning the mahdi, and thus put himself in opposition to\r\nthe sultan of Turkey as the only true commander of the faithful. To\r\nemphasize his position the mahdi struck coins in his own name and set\r\nhimself to suppress all customs introduced by the \"Turks.\" His social\r\nand religious reforms are contained in various proclamations, one of\r\nwhich is drawn up in the form of ten commandments. They concern,\r\nchiefly, such matters as ritual, prayers, soberness in food and raiment,\r\nthe cost of marriage and the behaviour of women. How far the mahdi was\r\nthe controller of the movement which he started cannot be known, but\r\nfrom the outset of his public career his right-hand man was a Baggara\r\ntribesman named Abdullah (the khalifa), who became his successor, and\r\nafter his flight to Jebel Gedir the mahdi was largely dependent for his\r\nsupport on Baggara sheikhs, who gratified one of his leading tastes by\r\ngiving him numbers of their young women. In the few months between the\r\nfall of Khartum and his death the mahdi, relieved from the incessant\r\nstrain of toil, copied in his private life all the vices of Oriental\r\ndespots while maintaining in public the austerity he demanded of his\r\nfollowers. His death is variously attributed to disease and to poisoning\r\nby a woman of his harem. On the occupation of Omdurman by the British\r\n(Sept. 1898) the mahdi's tomb was destroyed, his body burnt and the\r\nashes thrown into the Nile (see SUDAN: _Anglo-Egyptian_).\r\n\r\n  See _Mahdiism and the Egyptian Sudan_ by F. R. Wingate (1891); _Ten\r\n  Years' Captivity in the Mahdi's Camp_ (1882-1892) from the MS. of\r\n  Father Joseph Ohrwalder by F. R. Wingate (1892) and _Fire and Sword in\r\n  the Sudan_ (1879-1895) by Slatin Pasha (trans. F. R. Wingate, 1896).\r\n  Both Ohrwalder and Slatin were personally acquainted with the mahdi,\r\n  and their narratives contain much first-hand information. Wingate\r\n  prints many translations of the proclamations and correspondence of\r\n  the mahdi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOMMEDAN INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n  The Caliphate.\r\n\r\nOf all the institutions of Islam the caliphate is the oldest, the most\r\nfundamental, and in essence the most enduring. For its history see\r\nCALIPHATE; the present subject is its origin and nature. Mahomet enjoyed\r\nabsolute rule over his people as a divinely inspired and guided prophet.\r\nHe led the public prayers; he acted as judge; he ruled. If he consulted\r\nwith others or paid attention to public feeling or local usage, it was\r\nas a matter of policy; the ultimate decision lay with himself. He was\r\nthe state. On his death a leader was put in his place of similar\r\nauthority, though without the divine prophetic guidance. He was called\r\nthe \"successor\" (_khalifa_, caliph) of the Prophet, later also the\r\n_amir-al-mu'minin_, commander of the faithful, and was elected by the\r\nMoslems, just as the Arab tribes had always elected their chiefs. He was\r\nthus an absolute ruler, but was democratically elected; and such is the\r\nessence of the caliphate among Sunnite Moslems to this day. For them it\r\nhas been a matter of agreement (see MAHOMMEDAN LAW) from the earliest\r\ntimes that the Moslem community must appoint such a leader (see IMAM).\r\nThe Shi`ites, on the other hand, hold that the appointment lies with\r\nGod, and that God always has appointed, though his appointment may not\r\nalways have been known and accepted. Their position may be called a\r\nlegitimist one. Some few heretical sects have held that the necessity of\r\na leader was based on reason, not on the agreement of the community.\r\nBut, for all, the rule of the leader thus appointed is absolute, and all\r\nauthority is delegated from him and, in theory, can be resumed by him at\r\nany time. Just as God can require unreasoning obedience from his\r\ncreatures (his \"slaves\" in Arabic), so can the caliph, his\r\nrepresentative on earth.\r\n\r\nBut Abu Bekr, the first caliph, nominated his successor, Omar, and that\r\nnomination was accepted and confirmed by the people. So a second\r\nprecedent was fixed, which was again carried a step farther, when\r\nMoawiya I., the first Omayyad caliph, nominated his son, Yazid I., as\r\nhis successor, and caused an oath of allegiance to be taken to him. The\r\nhereditary principle was thus introduced, though some relics of the form\r\nof election persisted and still persist. The true election possible in\r\nthe early days of the small community at Medina became first a formal\r\nacceptance by the populace of the capital; then an assertion, by the\r\npalace guard, of their power; and now, in the investiture of the sultans\r\nof the Ottoman Turks, who claim the caliphate, a formal ceremony by the\r\n`ulema (q.v.) of Constantinople. The Ottoman claim is based on an\r\nasserted nomination by the last Abbasid, who died in exile in Egypt in\r\n1538, of the Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Great, as his successor. Such\r\na nomination in itself was a perfectly legal act, but in this case had a\r\nfatal flaw. It is an absolute condition, laid down in tradition, that\r\nthe caliph must be of the tribe of Koreish (Quraish), that of the\r\nProphet.\r\n\r\nThe duties of this democratically elected autocrat are, in theory,\r\ngenerally stated as follows. He shall enforce legal decisions and\r\nmaintain the divinely revealed restrictive ordinances; guard the\r\nfrontiers and equip armies; receive the alms; put down robberies,\r\nthieving, highwaymen; maintain the Friday services and the festivals;\r\ndecide disputes and receive evidence bearing on legal claims; marry\r\nminors, male and female, who have no guardians; divide booty. He must be\r\na free, male, adult Moslem; must have administrative ability; must be an\r\neffective governor and do justice to the wronged. So long as he fulfils\r\nthese conditions he is to be absolutely obeyed; private immorality or\r\neven tyranny are not grounds for deposing him. This is a position\r\nreached by Islam practically. But a caliph who openly denied the faith\r\nwould be as impossible as an unbelieving pope. The caliph, therefore, is\r\nthe highest executive officer of a system assumed to be definite and\r\nfixed. He, in a word, administers Islam; and the content of Islam is\r\ndetermined by the agreement of the Moslem people, expressed immediately\r\nthrough the `ulema, and ultimately, if indirectly and half-consciously,\r\nby the people. To depose him a _fatwa_ (see MUFTI) would be required--in\r\nTurkey from the Sheikh-ul-Islam--that he had violated some essential of\r\nthe Moslem faith, and no longer fulfilled the conditions of a caliph.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Diwans.\r\n\r\n  But it was impossible for the caliph personally to administer the\r\n  affairs of the empire, and by degrees the supreme office was gradually\r\n  put into commission, until the caliph himself became a mere\r\n  figure-head, and vanished into the sacred seclusion of his palace. The\r\n  history of the creation of government bureaus (_diwans_; see DIVAN)\r\n  must therefore now be sketched. The first need which appeared was that\r\n  of a means of regulating and administering the system of taxation and\r\n  the revenues of the state. Immense sums flowed into Medina from the\r\n  Arab conquests; the surplus, after the requirements of the state were\r\n  met, was distributed among the believers. All Moslems had a right to a\r\n  certain share of this, which was regarded as booty. Omar, the second\r\n  caliph, regulated this distribution and also the system of taxation,\r\n  and the result was the first divan and the constitution of Omar,\r\n  looked back to now by all Sunnite Moslems as an ideal. The sources of\r\n  revenue were (i) the poor-rate (_zakat_), a tithe paid by every\r\n  Moslem; (ii) the fifth of all booty; (iii) the poll-tax (_jizya_) on\r\n  non-Moslems; and (iv) the land-tax (_kharaj_) also on non-Moslems.\r\n  Thus the constitution determined the position of all non-Moslems in a\r\n  Moslem state. The ideal was that the Moslems should be kept apart as a\r\n  superior, fighting caste, and that the non-Moslems should support them\r\n  (cf. CALIPHATE, B. § 8, on the reign of Omar II.). The Moslems,\r\n  therefore, were forbidden to acquire land in conquered countries. The\r\n  non-Moslems must retain their lands, cultivate them and pay the\r\n  land-tax (the Arabic word is also used of revenue from the work of a\r\n  slave) and the poll-tax (the Arabic word means also \"ransom\"), and\r\n  give contributions in kind to support the local Moslem garrisons which\r\n  were massed in great camp-cities at strategic points. If a non-Moslem\r\n  embraced Islam he entered the ruling caste; his land was distributed\r\n  among his non-Moslem fellows, and he no longer paid the land-tax but\r\n  rather received support from the public funds. The amount of these\r\n  pensions varied with the standing of the pensioner from 10,000 dirhems\r\n  (a dirhem equalled about a franc) to the widows and relations of the\r\n  Prophet down to 300. This bureau had, therefore, not only to keep the\r\n  books of the state, but also to maintain a list of all Moslems,\r\n  classified genealogically and socially. Its registers were kept by\r\n  Greeks, Copts and Persians; the Arabs, it may be said in general,\r\n  adopted the method of administration which they found in the captured\r\n  countries and drew upon the trained services of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\n  Such a system led naturally to wholesale conversions to Islam; and the\r\n  consequent decline in revenue, combined with large donations of lands\r\n  by Othman, the third caliph, to his own family, gradually broke it\r\n  down. The first patriarchal period of conquest, unearned wealth and\r\n  the simple life--called by Moslems the period of the \"four rightly\r\n  guided caliphs,\" and very happily by Sachau, _ein mönchisches\r\n  Imperium_--passed rapidly into the genuinely Arab empire of the\r\n  Omayyads, with whom came an immediate development of organization in\r\n  the state. The constructive genius in this was Moawiya, the first\r\n  Omayyad caliph. Under him the old simplicity vanished. A splendid and\r\n  ceremonious court was maintained at Damascus. A chamberlain kept the\r\n  door; a bodyguard surrounded the caliph, and even in the mosque the\r\n  caliph, warned by the murder of Othman and of Ali, prayed in a\r\n  railed-off enclosure. The beginning of the seclusion of the caliph had\r\n  come, and he no longer walked familiarly among his fellow Moslems.\r\n  This seclusion increased still further when the administration of the\r\n  state passed by delegation into other hands, and the caliph himself\r\n  became a sacrosanct figure-head, as in the case of the later Abbasids;\r\n  when theories of semi-divine nature and of theocratic rule appeared,\r\n  as in the case of the Fatimites; and finally when all the elaborate\r\n  court ritual of Byzantium was inherited by the Ottoman sultans.\r\n\r\n  But Moawiya I. was still a very direct and personal ruler. He\r\n  developed a post-system for the carrying of government despatches by\r\n  relays, and thus received secret information from and kept control of\r\n  the most distant provinces. He established a sealing-bureau by which\r\n  state papers were secured against change. He dealt arbitrarily with\r\n  the revenues of the state and the pensions of the Moslems. Governors\r\n  of provinces were given a much freer hand, and were required to turn\r\n  over to the central treasury their surplus revenue only. As they were\r\n  either conquerors or direct successors of conquerors they had an\r\n  essentially military government, and were really semi-independent\r\n  rulers, unhampered except by direct action of the caliph, acting on\r\n  information sent by the postmaster, who was his local spy. Being thus\r\n  the heads of armies of occupation, they were not necessarily charged\r\n  with the control of religious ritual and of justice. These, like every\r\n  other function, inhered in the office of the caliph and he generally\r\n  appointed in each province independent cadis over the courts and imams\r\n  to be in charge of religious services. Yet the governor was sometimes\r\n  permitted to hold these two other offices (see CADI; IMAM).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Vizierate.\r\n\r\nFurther administrative developments came with the Abbasids. They created\r\na new city, Bagdad, between the Tigris and the Euphrates, where the\r\nthree races, Syrian, Arab and Persian, met and sought with Bagdad as a\r\ncapital to consolidate the empire. The Arab empire, it is true, had\r\npassed away with the Omayyads; yet there might be a chance to create a\r\nworld-empire of all the Moslem peoples. But not even the genius and\r\nadministrative skill of the early Abbasids could hold together that\r\nunwieldy mass. The semi-independent provinces soon became fully\r\nindependent, or at most acknowledged the caliph as a spiritual head and\r\npaid a nominal tribute. His name might stand on the coinage and prayers\r\nbe offered for him in the Friday service, the two signs of sovereignty\r\nto this day in Islam. With this crumbling of the empire went a more\r\nelaborate organization; bureaus took the place of principles and of the\r\nenergy of individual rulers. As the system of Moslem law was built on\r\nthat of the Roman codes, so was the machinery of administration on that\r\nof Persia. And with the Abbasids the chance of the Persians had come.\r\nAbu 'l-Abbas, the first Abbasid caliph, was the first to appoint a\r\nvizier (_wazir_, \"helper,\" so Aaron is wazir to Moses in the Koran), a\r\nconfidential minister to advise him and come between him and the people.\r\nAdvisers the caliphs had had before; but not a definite adviser with\r\nthis name. He must, we are told, have a strain of the ruler in him and a\r\nstrain of the people to be able to work with both. He must know how to\r\nbe acceptable; fidelity and truthfulness are his capital; sagacity,\r\nfirmness, generosity, clemency, dignity, effectiveness of speech are\r\nessential. It is plain that the vizier became as important as the\r\ncaliph. But Abu 'l-Abbas was fortunate in early securing as his vizier\r\nthe grandfather of the house of the Barmecides (q.v.). On this Persian\r\nfamily the fortunes of the Abbasids hung, and it secured for them and\r\nfor Islam a short golden age, like that of the Antonines, until the\r\njealous madness of Harun al-Rashid cast them down. Thereafter the\r\nvizierate had many vicissitudes. Technically a vizier could be either\r\nlimited or unlimited. The limited vizier had no initiative; he carried\r\nout the commands of the caliph. The unlimited vizier, often afterwards\r\ncalled the grand vizier, exercised full authority and was the _alter\r\nego_ of the caliph, to whom he was required only to report. Naturally\r\nthe formal distinction is a later theorizing of history; for a weak\r\nruler his vizier became absolute, for a strong ruler his vizier remained\r\nsubordinate. Here, as with regard to all Moslem institutions, a marked\r\ndistinction must be made between the historic facts and the speculative\r\nedifices raised by constitutional theorizers. Compare especially\r\nMAHOMMEDAN LAW. Until the time of Radi (934-940) the vizierate thus\r\nfluctuated in importance. In that caliphate the vizier lost all\r\nauthority, and in his place came the _amir al-omara_--equivalent to the\r\n_major domus_ of the Franks--the head of the Turkish bodyguard, in\r\nterror of whom the caliph now stood. When in 945 the Buyids captured\r\nBagdad and the caliph became a purely spiritual sovereign, they took the\r\ntitle \"vizier\" for their own chief minister, and the caliphs retained\r\nonly a secretary (see CALIPHATE, C. § 22). Under the Seljuks, however,\r\nthey regained their viziers and some real authority. Elsewhere, also the\r\nvizierate had its vicissitudes. Under the Mamelukes the vizier fell to\r\nbe merely the court purveyor. Under the Omayyads of Spain the title was\r\ngiven to several responsible officers of the state, but their chief was\r\ncalled _hajib_, chamberlain. Under the Almohades the chamberlain was\r\ncalled vizier. In the modern Turkish empire the grand vizier (called\r\ngenerally _sadr A`zam_) is the sultan's representative in secular\r\nmatters, and nominally stands between the sovereign and all the other\r\nofficials. He is the president of the council of ministers, but Abd-ul\r\nHamid II. deprived the office of almost all its importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Other Ministers.\r\n\r\n  Under the early Abbasids the four most important ministers were the\r\n  chief cadi, the chief of police or head of the life guards, the\r\n  minister of finance and the postmaster, who was the head of the system\r\n  of information and espionage which covered the empire. But at\r\n  different times the different bureaus varied greatly. Under Motawakkil\r\n  we find the bureau of taxes and finance; bureau of the crown estates;\r\n  bureau of state book-keeping; bureau of war, i.e. of hired troops;\r\n  bureau which kept reckoning and control of the pensions of the clients\r\n  and slaves of the ruling family; bureau of the post system; bureau of\r\n  expenditures. But in spite of this elaborate system, no Moslem\r\n  government has, except sporadically, been highly centralized. Provided\r\n  the taxes are paid, a large measure of local autonomy has always been\r\n  enjoyed by the country districts. Under the Abbasids almost the only\r\n  exception was the necessarily centralized control of the irrigation\r\n  system of the Tigris and Euphrates. And similarly elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  In the case of all these offices, we have delegation by the caliph,\r\n  under necessity, of his too heavy burdens. But one duty of an Oriental\r\n  ruler he could not so easily lay aside. It had always to be possible\r\n  for the oppressed to come into his presence and claim justice; he must\r\n  sit in the gate and judge. Therefore, when the caliph found it\r\n  necessary to delegate the ordinary administration of justice, he found\r\n  it also necessary to set up a special court of oppressions, which\r\n  developed, to a certain extent, into a court of appeals. The first to\r\n  establish such a separate court was Abdalmalik the Omayyad (685-705),\r\n  and his example was followed by the more vigorous of the caliphs up to\r\n  the time of Mohtadi the Abbasid (869-870). If any other than the\r\n  caliph presided over this court it had to be a man whose dignity,\r\n  independence and authority commanded respect. He was not bound by\r\n  strict rules of evidence, method and literal application of law as was\r\n  the cadi. Rather, he applied a system of equity suited to the absolute\r\n  source of authority which he represented.\r\n\r\n  As the chief of police, mentioned above, was rather the head of the\r\n  caliph's bodyguard, there was also a police system after our ideas,\r\n  but more thoroughgoing. The _muhtasib_ had charge in the broadest\r\n  sense of public order and morals in the streets, and had oversight as\r\n  to weights, measures and adulterations; but had no right to interfere\r\n  privately or enter houses save in the clearest and most necessary\r\n  cases. He had a summary jurisdiction in all minor cases where no trial\r\n  was necessary; but where witnesses and oaths entered the case must go\r\n  to the cadi. Slaves and beasts of burden were under his guardianship;\r\n  he prevented public scandals, such as the sale of wine; he regulated\r\n  the public conduct of Jews and Christians. In the interest of public\r\n  morals he had to find suitable husbands for widows and see that they\r\n  did not marry before the legal time; questions of paternity also he\r\n  had to investigate. The outdoor costume of the people he could\r\n  regulate. It should, of course, be remembered that the canon law of\r\n  Islam covers minutely all sides of life (see MAHOMMEDAN LAW).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in Islam to separate logically from the mass of\r\ninstitutions those which we should call religious, as Islam on all sides\r\nis for the Moslem equally religious. But perhaps the following may\r\npractically be separated under that rubric. Islam, runs a tradition, is\r\nbuilt on five things: testimony that there is no god save Allah, and\r\nthat Mahomet is the apostle of Allah; prayer; the poor-rate; pilgrimage;\r\nfasting. For these see MAHOMMEDAN RELIGION.\r\n\r\n  The law and usage of religious foundations in perpetuity (_waqf_,\r\n  mortmain) became as important in Islam as monastic endowments in\r\n  medieval Europe, and such foundations tended similarly to absorb the\r\n  greater part of the national wealth. It was the only safe way of\r\n  providing for posterity. A pious foundation could be erected in such a\r\n  way that either so much from its funds would be paid yearly in\r\n  perpetuity to the descendants of the erector, or those descendants\r\n  would be employed as officials of the foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Imam.\r\n\r\n  When it became impossible for the caliph to lead the people personally\r\n  in prayer in the mosque, he delegated that part of his duties to\r\n  another, hence called imam (q.v.). Naturally, then, the appointment of\r\n  the imam would lie with the supreme ruler. This holds of the daily\r\n  prayers in the principal mosque (_al-masjid al-jami'_) supported by\r\n  the ruler where the Friday service is held, but in the separate\r\n  smaller mosques built by each community the community chooses its own\r\n  imam. With regard to the Friday service, the schools of law disagree\r\n  as to the necessity of the presence of an imam appointed by the chief\r\n  ruler. But the imam should certainly make mention of the ruler in his\r\n  sermon and pray for him. At the occasional prayers, such as those for\r\n  rain, &c., the presence of an imam appointed by the ruler is not\r\n  necessary. The imam appoints the _muaddhin_, the announcer of the hour\r\n  of prayer from the minaret, and both have a claim on the state\r\n  treasury.\r\n\r\n  Another office exercised when possible by the caliph, but very\r\n  frequently delegated to some high dignitary, such as the heir to the\r\n  caliphate or a prince, was the leadership of the pilgrimage caravan to\r\n  Mecca and back. Sometimes this official, called _amir-al-hajj_, was\r\n  appointed imam as well. He then led all the pilgrimage ceremonies at\r\n  Mecca. When outside of towns where there was a cadi he exercised also\r\n  over the caravan the rights of a judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Cadi.\r\n\r\n  Mahommedan law (q.v.) is treated separately. Here, again, as judging\r\n  is a duty of the caliph, a cadi is the delegate, or, when appointed by\r\n  a vizier or governor, a delegate of his delegate. He examines into\r\n  disputes brought before him and enforces his judgments, he names\r\n  administrators of the estates of minors, the insane, &c.; he\r\n  supervises the _waqf_ property of mosques and schools in his district\r\n  and inspects highways and public buildings; he watches over the\r\n  execution of wills; he inflicts the due legal penalties for apostasy,\r\n  neglect of religious duties, refusal to pay taxes, theft, adultery,\r\n  outrages, murder; he can inflict the penalties of imprisonment, fine,\r\n  corporal punishment, death; if there is no imam, he can perform his\r\n  duty, as in fact can anyone who has the requisite knowledge. But it\r\n  should be noticed that all this holds only of the un-europeanized\r\n  Moslem state.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Army.\r\n\r\nFor the existence of an army in Islam, there are two grounds, the holy\r\nwar (_jihad_, q.v.) against unbelievers without the state and the\r\nsuppression of rebellion within. Under the ordinance of Omar the entire\r\ncommunity was preserved and used as a weapon for the subduing of the\r\nworld to Islam, and every able-bodied male Moslem was theoretically a\r\nfighting man, part of the national militia. This army was divided into\r\ncorps situated in the conquered lands, as armies of occupation, where\r\nthey eventually came to form military colonies in great camp-cities. The\r\noccupied countries had to support them, and they were bound to render\r\nmilitary service at any time. But as the ideal of Omar broke down before\r\nfacts the use of mercenary and slave troops finally increased; although\r\nthere has always continued in Moslem armies acting against unbelievers a\r\nproportion of volunteers not paid a fixed wage but subsidized by the\r\nstate from the poor-rate and alms funds. The generals were appointed by\r\nthe caliph, and had either unlimited authority to act as his\r\nrepresentatives, concluding peace, acting as cadi and imam, distributing\r\nbooty; or were restricted within limits, e.g. to simple leading of the\r\ntroops and carrying on military operations. They, in turn, appointed\r\ntheir subordinates; this principle of giving a head full powers and full\r\nresponsibility was very generally applied in Islam. It was controlled of\r\ncourse by the espionage of the postal system. As war by a Moslem power\r\nis essentially sacred war, the regulations of _jihad_ must be considered\r\nhere. Unbelievers must first be invited to embrace Islam and, if they\r\nfollow a sacred book and are not idol-worshippers, are given a choice\r\nbetween (a) becoming Moslems; or (b) submitting to the Moslems and\r\nentering on a treaty with them of protection and tribute; or (c)\r\nfighting. If they accept Islam, their lives, families and property are\r\nsecure, and they form henceforth part of the Moslem community. The\r\nability of Islam to create a common feeling between highly different\r\nraces is one of its most striking features. If they submit and enter on\r\ntreaty relations, they pay a poll-tax, for which their personal safety\r\nis assured, and assume a definitely inferior status, having no technical\r\ncitizenship in the state, only the condition of protected clients\r\n(_dhimmis_). If they elect to fight, the door of repentance is open,\r\neven when the armies are face to face. But after defeat their lives are\r\nforfeit, their families are liable to slavery, and all their goods to\r\nseizure. It is open to the sovereign either to put them to death; or to\r\nenslave them; or to give them their liberty; or to exchange them for\r\nransom or against Moslem prisoners. The sovereign will choose that which\r\nis best for Islam. As for their families and wealth, the sovereign can\r\nrelease them only with consent of the army that has captured them.\r\nApostates must be put to death. Four-fifths of the booty after a battle\r\ngoes to the conquering army.\r\n\r\nThe technical art of war seems to have been little studied among\r\nMoslems; they have treatises on archery but very little upon tactics.\r\nTheir writers recognize, however, the essential difference between the\r\nEuropean and Persian methods of charging in solid lines and holding the\r\nground stubbornly, and the Arab and Berber method of flying attacks and\r\nretreats by clouds of cavalry. Therefore, one explained, the custom grew\r\nof using a mass of European mercenaries as a fixed nucleus and\r\nrallying-point. The early Moslem armies, too, had used the solid,\r\nunyielding charge, which may have been the secret of their success. For\r\none of the greatest puzzles of history is the cause which changed the\r\nerratic, untrustworthy swarms of Arab horsemen with their childish\r\nstrategy into the ever-victorious legions of the first caliphs. They\r\ncertainly learned rapidly. Byzantium and Persia taught them the use of\r\nmilitary engines and the entrenched camp. Before that they had been, at\r\nthe best, single knights with mail-shirt, helmet, sword and lance.\r\nBowmen, too, they used, but the principal use of the bow seems to have\r\ncome with the Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Education.\r\n\r\n  The glory of Moslem education was its university system, which fed the\r\n  higher learning and did not serve everyday needs. Its primary system\r\n  was very poor, almost non-existent; and technical education has never\r\n  been recognized in Islam. Primary teachers were despised as ignorant\r\n  and foolish. Apparently, if we may trust the many stories of how\r\n  ignorant men set up for themselves, there was no control of them by\r\n  the state. Their pupils were young only; they taught the rudiments of\r\n  reading, Koran, catechism, prayer, writing and arithmetic, but very\r\n  little of the latter. Technical education was given by the gilds\r\n  through their apprentice system, teaching mechanical arts and crafts.\r\n  This was genuine instruction, but was not so regarded; it was looked\r\n  upon rather as are the mysteries and secrets of operative masonry. It\r\n  produced artisans of independent character, but not artists. Thus\r\n  there was no distinction between architect and builder; there was no\r\n  sculpture; and painting, so far as it went, was like carving, a craft.\r\n  All Moslem university education, like all Moslem science, revolved\r\n  round theology. There were, apparently, only two outstanding\r\n  exceptions to this rule, the academy of Mamun (813-833) at Bagdad, and\r\n  the hall of wisdom of the Fatimites at Cairo (1004-1171); both of\r\n  these are explained by their environment. From the earliest times,\r\n  independent scholars instructed classes in mosques--the common places\r\n  of meeting for the community--and gave their pupils personal\r\n  certificates. Their subjects were the reading and interpretation of\r\n  the Koran; the body of traditions from the Prophet; the thence deduced\r\n  system of theology; the canon law. But the interpretation of the Koran\r\n  involved grammatical and lexicographical studies of early Arabic, and\r\n  hence of the early Arabic literature. Theology came to involve\r\n  metaphysical and logical studies. Canon law required arithmetic and\r\n  mensuration, practical astronomy, &c. But these last were strictly\r\n  ancillary; the object of the instruction was primarily to give\r\n  knowledge of value for the life of the next world, and, secondarily,\r\n  to turn out theologians and lawyers. Medicine was in Jewish and\r\n  Christian hands; engineering, architecture, &c., with their\r\n  mathematical bases, were crafts. Then this instruction was gradually\r\n  subsidized and organized by the state, or endowed by individuals. How\r\n  early this took place is uncertain. But the individual teacher, with\r\n  his certificate, remained the object of the student; there was nothing\r\n  corresponding to our general degrees. Thirdly, educational\r\n  institutions came to be equipped with scholarships of money or in kind\r\n  for the students. The first instance of this is generally ascribed to\r\n  Nishapur (Naisabur) in 1066; but it soon became general in the system\r\n  and afforded a means of control and centralization. A final, and most\r\n  important, characteristic was the wide journeying of the students \"in\r\n  search of knowledge.\" Aided by Arabic as the universal language of\r\n  learning, students journeyed from teacher to teacher, and from\r\n  Samarkand to the Atlantic, gathering on their way hundreds of personal\r\n  certificates. Scholars were thus kept in touch all over the Moslem\r\n  world, and intellectual unity was maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Sayyids.\r\n\r\nTo the democratic equality of Islam, in which the slave of to-day may be\r\nthe prime minister of to-morrow, there is one outstanding exception. The\r\ndescendants of the Prophet and of his relatives (the family of Hashim)\r\nformed and form a special class, held in social reverence, and guarded\r\nfrom contamination and injury. These are the _sayyids_ (lords), and\r\ngenealogical registers of them are carefully preserved. They are of all\r\ndegrees of wealth and poverty, but are guarded legally from\r\n_mésalliances_ with persons of ignoble origin or equivocal occupation.\r\nTheir influence is very great, and in some parts of the Moslem world\r\nthey have the standing and reverence of saints.\r\n\r\n  See Von Kremer, _Culturgeschichte des Orients_, based largely on\r\n  Mawardi's _Ahkam_, trans. in part by Ostrorog; McG. de Slane's trans.\r\n  of Ibn Khaldun, _Prolégomènes_; Lane, _Manners and Customs of the\r\n  Modern Egyptians_; R.

(D. B. Ma.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOMMEDAN LAW. The legal situation in the Moslem world is of the\r\nhighest complexity, and can be made intelligible only by tracing its\r\nhistorical development. First came the system (_fiqh_, _sharia_) which\r\ntakes the place in Islam of canon law in Roman Christendom. It begins\r\nwith Mahomet sitting as judge over the primitive Moslem community at\r\nMedina. He was the Prophet of God, and judged, as he ruled, absolutely;\r\nany decision of his was valid. But he found it, in general, advisable\r\nand fitting to follow the local law or usage of Medina when the new\r\nfaith did not require a change. It thus came about that his decisions\r\nfollowed, at one time, the usage of the Arab tribes of Medina; at\r\nanother, the law respected by the Jewish tribes there--a rabbinic\r\ndevelopment of the law of Moses, deeply affected by Roman law; at\r\nanother, the more developed commercial law of Mecca, known to his\r\nfollowers who had fled thence with him; or, finally, his own personal\r\njudgment, stated it might be as his own sense of right or as the\r\ndecision of Allah and even incorporated in the Koran. In his use of\r\nthese he was an eclectic opportunist, and evidently, except as regards\r\nsuch frequently recurring subjects as inheritance, marriage, &c., had no\r\nthought of building up a system or code. At his death he left behind\r\nonly a few specific prescriptions in the Koran and a mass of recorded\r\ndecisions of cases that had come before him. He had used himself, in our\r\nterms, common law, equity, legislation; to guide his followers he left\r\nhis legislative enactments and the record of his use of common law.\r\nSince his death there has been no new legislation in orthodox Islam.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Mahomet began the development and codification of\r\nMoslem law. It was at first entirely practical. Cases had to be decided,\r\nand to decide them there was, first, the Koran; secondly, if nothing _ad\r\nrem_ was found in the Koran, there were the decisions of the Prophet;\r\nthirdly, if these failed, there was the common law of Medina; and,\r\nfourthly, if it, in turn, failed, the common sense of the judge, or\r\nequity. A knowledge of the decisions of Mahomet came thus to be of great\r\nimportance, and records of such decisions were eagerly sought and\r\npreserved. But this was simply a part of a much wider movement and\r\ntendency. As among primitive peoples in general, custom and usage have\r\nalways been potent among the Arabs. The ways of the fathers, the old\r\npaths, they love to tread. Very early there arose a special reverence\r\nfor the path and usage (_sunna_) of Mahomet. Whatever he did or said, or\r\nleft unsaid or undone, and how he did it, has become of the first\r\nimportance to the pious Moslem, who would act in every way as did the\r\nProphet. There is evidence that for this purpose the immediate\r\ncompanions of Mahomet took notes, either in memory or in writing, of his\r\ntable talk and wise sayings, just as they took down or learned by heart\r\nfor their private use the separate fragments of the Koran. His sayings\r\nand doings, manners and customs, his answers to questions on religious\r\nlife and faith, above all his decisions in legal disputes, came to be\r\nrecorded on odd sheets in private notebooks. This was the beginning of\r\nthe enormous literature of traditions (_hadith_) in Islam. The\r\ncollecting and preserving of these, which was at first private, for\r\npersonal guidance and edification, finally became one of the most\r\npowerful weapons of political and theological propaganda, and coloured\r\nthe whole method and fabric of Moslem thought. All knowledge tended to\r\nbe expressed in that form, and each element of it to be traced back to,\r\nand given in the words of, some master or other through a chain of\r\ntransmitters. Above all there grew up an enormous mass of evidently\r\nforged sayings put into the mouth of Mahomet. At every important\r\npolitical or theological crisis each party would invent and put into\r\ncirculation a tradition from him, supporting its view. By a study of\r\nthese flatly opposed \"sayings\" it is possible to reconstruct the\r\ndifferent controversies of Islam in the past, and to discover what each\r\nparty regarded as the essence of its position.\r\n\r\n  The first collecting of traditions was for private purposes, and the\r\n  first publication dealing with them was legal. This was the Muwatta'\r\n  of Malik ibn Anas (d. 795), a _corpus juris_ based partly on\r\n  traditions, and a protest in its methods against the too speculative\r\n  character of the books of canon law which preceded it. Thereafter came\r\n  collections of two different types. The earlier kind was arranged\r\n  according to the companions of Mahomet, on whose authority the\r\n  traditions were transmitted; after each companion came the traditions\r\n  going back to him. The best known example of this kind is the _Musnad_\r\n  of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. The other kind, called _Musannaf_ (classified),\r\n  contains traditions arranged in chapters according to their subject\r\n  matter. That of Bukhari is the most famous, and is arranged to give a\r\n  traditional basis for a complete system of canon law; its rubrics are\r\n  those of such a system. Another is that of Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, who\r\n  paid less attention to legal aspects and more to minute accuracy.\r\n  There are many others of more or less acceptance and canonicity.\r\n  Bukhari's book enjoys a reverence only second to that of the Koran.\r\n  But in all these publications the primary object was to purify the\r\n  mass of traditions of forged accretions and to give to the believer a\r\n  sound basis for his knowledge of the usages of the Prophet, whether\r\n  for his personal or for public use. These two kinds were a natural\r\n  development. In the Moslem community there were from the first\r\n  students of tradition proper whose interest lay in collecting, testing\r\n  and transmitting, not in combining, systematizing and elucidating;\r\n  whose preference was to take a single statement from the Prophet and\r\n  apply it to a case, without reasonings or questionings. And there were\r\n  students of canon law who were interested rather in the system and\r\n  results, and who, while they used traditions, used them only to an end\r\n  and insisted on the free application of speculative principles. The\r\n  conflict of the future was to be between these traditionalists, on the\r\n  one hand, and rationalists, on the other; and the result was to be a\r\n  compromise.\r\n\r\nWith the wide sweep of Moslem conquest another element came into the\r\ndevelopment. This was Roman law, which the Moslem jurist found at work\r\nin the conquered Roman provinces and in the law courts of which they\r\nwent to school. It is to be remembered that the Arab armies were not\r\ndevastating hordes; they recognized the need of law and order wherever\r\nthey went, and it was the policy of their leaders to take over the\r\nadministrative systems of the countries which they seized. Even the\r\nArabic legal nomenclature shows evident signs of literal translation\r\nfrom Latin, and many Moslem principles can be traced to the Roman codes.\r\nOne important development was plainly influenced by the liberty involved\r\nin the _Responsa prudentium_ of Roman lawyers, and by the broad\r\nconception of the law of nature in the Edict of the Praetor. In its\r\nearliest stages Moslem law recognized in the judge a liberty of opinion\r\n(_ra'y_) which went beyond even that of the _Responsa_ and became plain\r\nequity, in the English sense, and one school (the Hanifite) established\r\nas a basis the right of preference (_istihsan_) even when the analogy of\r\nthe code dictated otherwise; while another (the Malikite) used the term\r\n_istislah_, \"a seeking of (general) benefit\" to the community, in a\r\nsimilar situation. But these developments were bitterly contested, and\r\nthe liberty of opinion was in the end narrowed down to a principle of\r\nanalogy (_qiyas_), the nearest approach to which in Western law is legal\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to return to the first successors of Mahomet. \"For\r\nthirty years after my death,\" he is said to have declared, \"my people\r\nwill tread in my path (_sunna_); thereafter will come kings and\r\nprinces.\" This tradition crystallizes the later feeling of Islam. The\r\nfirst thirty years were a golden age; the centre of the state was the\r\nProphet's own city of Medina; the conditions of the state continued in\r\nclose conformity to those of his own time. The study of tradition, i.e.\r\nof his usage, went hand in hand with the study of law. They were vital\r\nfunctions of the state, and it encouraged both.\r\n\r\nThen came the great _débâcle_. The _ancien régime_, a semi-monkish,\r\ntheocratic empire, went down, and the Omayyad dynasty, kings and princes\r\nof the old Arab type, took its place (see CALIPHATE, B). The public life\r\nof the state was no longer deeply religious; the pious said that it was\r\ngodless. Under these conditions law was indeed still needed; but it had\r\nto be opportunist. Its development went on, but became speculative. The\r\nstudy of tradition was now private, and its students were more and more\r\nthe personally pious. There were, thus, two results. On the one hand,\r\nthe framers of systems of canon law--as it now was--no longer lived in\r\ncontact with reality; hypothetical and ideal structures were reared\r\nwhich could never stand the touch of the practical law-court. And on\r\nanother, traditions and law, even this hypothetical law, came to take\r\nseparate roads. The interest of the students of tradition became the\r\ngathering of traditions for their own sake, going no farther than a\r\nstriving to regulate each detail of life by some specific, concrete,\r\nprophetic dictum. They had no use for systems that went beyond the mere\r\nregistering of these dicta. The feeling also became widespread that any\r\nsystem of government which did not simply reproduce the patriarchal form\r\nof Medina was of the world and the devil--a thing with which no\r\nreligious man could have aught to do. At every turn he would have to\r\nperil his soul.\r\n\r\nHere we must place the transition of this law with which we have\r\nhitherto dealt from being the law of the land to being in essence a\r\nvariety of canon law. It was always broader than any western secular\r\nlaw. It regulated all the aspects of life--duty to God, to one's\r\nneighbour, to one's self. It was really a system of duties, ethical,\r\nlegal, religious. It did not limit itself to defining the forbidden\r\n(_haram_); but designated actions also as required (_fard_, _wajib_),\r\nrecommended (_mandub_, _mustahabb_), indifferent (_ja`iz_, _mubah_),\r\ndisliked (_makruh_). It played the part of, or rendered necessary, a\r\nreligious director quite as much as a lawyer. And for a time at Medina\r\nit was really the law of the land. But from the Omayyad period on it has\r\nheld the position of the canon law of the Roman Church in countries that\r\nwill not recognize it and yet dare not utterly reject it. It governs, in\r\none or other of its four schools, the private lives of all pious\r\nMoslems; it regulates some semi-public relationships--e.g. marriage,\r\ndivorce, inheritance; it compels respect, if not acceptance, from the\r\nstate; and by its ideal standard the world, filled with righteousness by\r\nthe Mahdi, will be ruled in the Moslem millennium.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Abbasids brought a change, but not a great one. They had\r\npromised a return to the old religious attitudes, and the promise was\r\nformally kept. But in substance they were as much as the Omayyads, and\r\nthough the state was outwardly on a pious footing, and the religious\r\nsentiment of the people was respected, the old, absolute canon law was\r\nnot restored. It was made possible for more theologians and lawyers to\r\nwork with the state, but an irreconcilable party still remained, and the\r\nsituation was fixed as it is to this day. It is true that the struggle\r\nto adapt such a single and detailed system to all the varying\r\nconditions, climates and times of the great empire was impossible; but\r\nthe failure marked the great rent in the supposed unity of Islam between\r\nthe church and the world, religion and law.\r\n\r\nYet the Abbasids did, in their way, encourage legal studies, and under\r\nthem processes and results, long pursued in private, became public.\r\nAlmost within the first century of their dynasty the four legal schools,\r\nor rites, were formed and the principles established which survive to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n  The first school to take definite form was the Hanifite, founded by\r\n  Abu Hanifa (d. 767), who left behind him a definite system and many\r\n  enthusiastic pupils. He was a man of means, in touch with commercial,\r\n  but not with practical legal life, a speculative or philosophical\r\n  jurist. Being of non-Arab origin, the usage of Medina had small\r\n  interest for him. He therefore used few traditions, and preferred to\r\n  go back to the Koran, and extract from it by reasoning the rulings\r\n  which fitted his ideas. This he called the use of analogy (_qiyas_);\r\n  but, in his hands, it became practically legal fiction, the\r\n  application of a law in some sense undreamed by its first imposer. But\r\n  he had another, and still freer instrument. The effect of differences\r\n  in local conditions had been early observed and admitted in general\r\n  terms. Abu Hanifa reduced it to a subjective formula. Under such\r\n  conditions he claimed the right of preference (_istihsan_) of a ruling\r\n  suited to the local needs, even when the strict analogy indicated\r\n  otherwise. This met and meets with vehement protest when formally\r\n  stated, but the usage of Islam has practically accepted it. His\r\n  system, finally, was not developed through the exigencies of actual\r\n  cases, but was worked out as a system of casuistry, though in a good\r\n  sense. He tried, that is, to construct a system of rules to answer any\r\n  conceivable question. After his death his pupils elaborated it still\r\n  further, and accepted public office. The `Abbasids adopted his school,\r\n  and threw their influence on its side; its philosophic breadth and\r\n  casuistic possibilities evidently commended it to them. Later, the\r\n  Ottoman Turks also adopted it, and it may be said to hold now a\r\n  leadership among the four legal rites. Its influence has undoubtedly\r\n  tended to broaden and humanize Moslem law.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-eight years after Abu Hanifa, Malik ibn Anas, the founder of\r\n  the Malikite school, died at Medina. In many points his situation was\r\n  precisely opposite to that of Abu Hanifa, and yet his results were\r\n  very similar. He was a working jurist, in practical touch with actual\r\n  life; he was in the centre of the tradition of the usage of the\r\n  Prophet, in the line, one might say, of the apostolic succession. He,\r\n  therefore, used traditions much more generally than did Abu Hanifa,\r\n  and when he, under pressure, took refuge in opinion, he certainly felt\r\n  that he, under his conditions, had a better right to do so than any\r\n  outsider. But two of his principles marked a distinct advance and\r\n  showed that he was no mere traditionalist. For one, he laid down the\r\n  conception of public advantage (_istislah_); when a rule founded on\r\n  even a valid analogy would work a general injury it was to be set\r\n  aside; justice must not be overcome by logic. And, for the other, he\r\n  laid stress on the conception of the agreement (_ijma`_), an idea\r\n  which was to have indefinite importance in the future. When the\r\n  surviving companions of the Prophet, after his death, agreed upon any\r\n  point as belonging to their store of tradition and experience, their\r\n  agreement was accepted as final. In the first instance they agreed\r\n  that such had been the statement of the Prophet. That easily passed\r\n  over into an agreement that such was the true Moslem view, and finally\r\n  into an acceptance of the principle that the Moslem Church, when\r\n  unanimous, could formulate truth--practically as in the canon of\r\n  Vincent of Lérins, _Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus_. But\r\n  such a broadly catholic position was still in the future, and for\r\n  Malik, juristic agreement meant the agreement of Medina, though there\r\n  are signs that he permitted the same latitude to other places also. It\r\n  was a way of allowing for local conditions rather than of reaching the\r\n  voice of the Church. His law book, the _Muwatta'_, the earliest in our\r\n  possession written by the founder of a school, has already been\r\n  mentioned. It is a collection of about seventeen hundred traditions of\r\n  juristic importance, arranged according to subject, with appended\r\n  remarks on the usage of Medina and on his own view of each matter.\r\n\r\n  So far opinion and local usage had fully held their own, and the\r\n  philosophical jurist had been free to work out his system. The\r\n  difference between the _istihsan_ of Abu Hanifa and the _istislah_ of\r\n  Malik was not great; students attended the lectures of both and\r\n  combined their systems. But a reaction now began, and the\r\n  traditionalist party finally made itself felt. We have the inevitable\r\n  rivalry between the historical-empirical and the\r\n  speculative-philosophical schools of jurisprudence, rendered all the\r\n  more bitter in that the historical lawyers believed, in this case,\r\n  that they were defending a divine institution. There resulted, first,\r\n  one of the most important schools, the Shafi`ite; secondly, an\r\n  extremely literal school for which ash-Shafi`i did not go far enough,\r\n  and which has now vanished; and thirdly, the Hanbalite school, still\r\n  surviving in small numbers, more moderately traditional than the last.\r\n\r\n  The school founded by ash-Shafi`i (d. 820), a pupil of Malik, came\r\n  first in order of time. The others were really revolts against the\r\n  mildness of his compromise. His characteristics were a broad-minded,\r\n  steady grasp of means and ends, a perception of what could and what\r\n  could not be done, a willingness to admit all the tried principles in\r\n  due balance, and, at one point especially, the insight of genius as to\r\n  the possibilities of these principles. He laid great stress on\r\n  tradition; a clear, authentic tradition he regarded as no less valid\r\n  than the Koran itself. If the tradition was chronologically later than\r\n  a Koranic passage and corrected that passage, he followed the\r\n  tradition. But in this he was only regulating a fixed tendency. The\r\n  Koran may be regarded theoretically as the first of all the sources of\r\n  law and theology; practically its clear statements have been\r\n  over-ridden in many cases. Most important of all, the principle of\r\n  agreement (_ijma`_) came finally with him to its full rights. The\r\n  agreement of the Moslem peoples was to be the voice of God. \"My\r\n  people,\" said a tradition from Mahomet, \"will never agree in an\r\n  error.\" And so, over traditions and over the Koran itself, the\r\n  agreement tacitly or explicitly ruled and rules. It stamps as\r\n  authoritative that which the other principles lay down. At the head of\r\n  each section of a Shafi`ite law book we read, \"The basis of this,\r\n  before the agreement, is such and such.\" But with the aid of a\r\n  principle of this breadth it was easy to reject the opinion which was\r\n  so objectionable to the traditionalist party. In its place he took\r\n  analogy (_qiyas_), which, discreetly used, could serve almost the same\r\n  purpose. The Koranic passage or the tradition with which an analogy\r\n  was suggested should, he taught, be examined to see if there was a\r\n  reason clearly stated for the command. If so, that reason would give a\r\n  basis for the analogy. Analogy based on the mechanical or external\r\n  could not hold.\r\n\r\n  The four bases thus laid down by ash-Shafi`i--Koran; prophetic usage\r\n  as expressed in traditions; analogy; agreement--have come to be\r\n  accepted by all existing schools. This applies to all spheres of life,\r\n  ethical, social, theological, legal, and it should never be forgotten\r\n  that the Koran is only one of the sources for Moslem faith and\r\n  conduct.\r\n\r\n  Few words are needed for the other, reactionary schools. One, now long\r\n  extinct, was founded by a certain Da`ud uz-Zahiri, \"David the\r\n  Literalist,\" born three or four years before the death of ash-Shafi`i,\r\n  and so called because he insisted upon an absolutely literal\r\n  interpretation of his texts--Koran or tradition--without account of\r\n  context or metaphor. In consequence he had to reject analogy, and\r\n  limited agreement to that of the companions of Mahomet; the Church of\r\n  Islam was to have no constructive authority. In one point he showed\r\n  great sanity of judgment, namely in his rejection of the principle\r\n  _jurare in verba magistri_, otherwise regnant in Islam. His school had\r\n  long and interesting consequences, mostly theological, but is now\r\n  extinct, and never took rank with the others. The Moslem world found\r\n  his positions too impossible, and now no one swears to his words. The\r\n  other, the Hanbalite school, was founded by the scholars of Ahmad ibn\r\n  Hanbal after his death in 885. He himself would never have revolted\r\n  against his master, ash-Shafi`i, but it was soon felt that his system,\r\n  so far as he had any, was in essential opposition. He had been no\r\n  lawyer, but a theologian and a collector and student of traditions.\r\n  All his life had been a protest against speculation in divine things.\r\n  Where the Koran and traditions were silent, he, too, had been silent.\r\n  For this agnostic principle he had witnessed and suffered, and his\r\n  standing with the people was that of a saint. Naturally, then, the\r\n  last still existent school of traditionalist protest was launched in\r\n  his name. It minimizes agreement and analogy, is literal in its\r\n  interpretations, and is now by far the smallest of the four surviving\r\n  schools. Its external history is that of a testifying and violent\r\n  minority.\r\n\r\n  Other men, such as Tabari, the historian and commentator, have had\r\n  dreams that they, too, might join the Four Imams (see IMAM) as\r\n  founders of legal rites, but none has succeeded. The Four remain the\r\n  ultimate exponents of this canon law, and under the banner of one or\r\n  other of them every Moslem must range himself. As there is a principle\r\n  of unity in Islam, expressed in the alleged prophetic saying, \"My\r\n  people will never agree in an error,\" so there is a principle of\r\n  variety, also expressed in an alleged prophetic saying, \"The\r\n  disagreement of my people is a mercy from God.\" The four rites may\r\n  differ upon many points, yet the adherents of one never dream of\r\n  regarding the adherents of the others as outside the Church of Islam;\r\n  they are not \"dissenters\" in the English sense. God is merciful to his\r\n  creatures, and gives them so much liberty of choice. Yet in practice\r\n  this liberty is not great. The principle of swearing to the words of\r\n  the master is a dead hand laid upon Islam. A man's legal rite is\r\n  generally settled by the place and other conditions of his birth, and\r\n  after he has once accepted a rite, he must, if good and pious, follow\r\n  it in all its details. Only the avowed sceptic or the recognized\r\n  eccentric can be an eclectic.\r\n\r\n  The geographical distribution of the rites is roughly as follows:\r\n  Moslems in Central Asia and northern India and the Turks everywhere\r\n  are Hanifites; in Lower Egypt, Syria, southern India and the Malay\r\n  Archipelago they are Shafi`ites; in Upper Egypt and in north Africa,\r\n  west of Egypt, they are Malikites; only the Wahhabis (q.v.) in central\r\n  Arabia are Hanbalites. But the will of the sovereign has also had a\r\n  powerful influence and has frequently dictated the legal, as well as\r\n  the theological, affiliations of his subjects. The Turks, for example,\r\n  have thrown their weight almost everywhere on the Hanifite side. Their\r\n  policy is to appoint only Hanifite judges (see CADI), although for\r\n  private and personal questions they appoint and pay Muftis (q.v.) of\r\n  the other rites. In other cases, with a population of mixed legal\r\n  adherence, the government has been known to appoint judges of\r\n  different rites.\r\n\r\n  The Shi`ite canon law is dealt with separately, but some mention of\r\n  two outstanding sects is here in place. The Ibadites (see MAHOMMEDAN\r\n  RELIGION: _Sects_) have a system of canon law which in essentials is\r\n  of older codification than that of any of the orthodox schools, going\r\n  back to Abdallah ibn Ibad himself, of the first century of the Hijra\r\n  (Hejira). Its basis is above all the Koran, then a sparing use of\r\n  traditions, natural to their early origin, and finally the agreement\r\n  of their own learned men, again natural to an extreme dissenting sect,\r\n  and it still rules the Ibadite communities at Oman, Zanzibar and the\r\n  Mzab in southern Algeria. At all these places they, the last\r\n  descendants of the Kharijites, hold severely apart, while the other\r\n  Moslems shrink from them as heretics of the worst. Not nearly so far\r\n  from ordinary Islam, but still of an extreme self-conscious Puritanism\r\n  are the Wahhabis. They are really Hanbalites, but apply the rules of\r\n  that school with uncompromising, reforming energy. The doctrine of the\r\n  agreement of the Church of Islam they reject; only that of the\r\n  immediate companions of Mahomet is valid. The people of Mahomet can\r\n  err and has erred; each man must, on his own responsibility, draw his\r\n  doctrine from the Koran and the traditions. Here they follow the\r\n  Zahirites.\r\n\r\nAll these schools of law administer a scheme of duties, which, as has\r\nalready been remarked, comes nearest to the canon law of the Roman\r\nChurch, and which for centuries has had only a partial connexion with\r\nthe real legal systems of the Moslem peoples. Among the Wahhabis and\r\nIbadites alone is it the whole of law. Elsewhere, since the Omayyad\r\nperiod, its courts have been in great part pushed aside by others, and\r\nits scheme has come to be regarded as an expression of impossible\r\ntheory, to be realized at best with the coming of the millennium. The\r\ncauses and methods of this change call now for detailed notice.\r\n\r\nAs Islam spread beyond the desert and the conditions in which the life\r\nof Mahomet and his companions had been cast, it came to regions,\r\nclimates, customs, where the Arabian usages no longer held. Not only\r\nwere the prescripts of Medina ill adapted to the new conditions; the new\r\npeople had legal usages of their own to which they clung and which\r\nnothing could make them abandon. It was rather the Moslem leaders who\r\nwere compelled to abandon their ideas and for the sake of the spread of\r\nIslam to accept and incorporate much that was diametrically opposed to\r\nthe original legislation either of the Koran or of Mahomet's recorded\r\ndecisions. As in religion the faiths of the conquered peoples were\r\nthinly veneered with Moslem phrases, so in law there grew up a customary\r\ncode (_`adat_) for each country, differing from every other, which often\r\ncompletely obscured and annulled the prescriptions of the canon law. The\r\none was an ideal system, studied and praised by the pious learned; the\r\nother was the actual working of law in the courts.\r\n\r\nBut besides the obstinate adherence of various peoples to their old\r\npaths, the will of individual rulers was a determining factor. When\r\nthese ceased to be saints and students of divine things, and came to be\r\nworldly statesmen and opportunists, followers of their own objects and\r\npleasures, no system could hold which set a limit to their authority.\r\nThe Oriental ruler must rule and judge on his own initiative, and the\r\nschools of canon law tended to reduce everything to an academic\r\nfixedness. There thus arose a new and specific statute law, emanating\r\nfrom the sovereign. At first he judged in the gate as seemed good in his\r\neyes and as was his right and duty (cf. \"court of oppressions\"; see\r\nMAHOMMEDAN INSTITUTIONS); later, his will was codified as in the Turkish\r\nstatute law (_qawanin_) derived from various European codes. Thus there\r\nhas grown up in almost every Moslem country at least two systems of\r\ncourts, the one administering this canon law, and taking cognisance of\r\nprivate and family affairs, such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, its\r\nofficials also giving rulings on purely personal religious questions,\r\nsuch as details of the ritual law, the law of oaths and vows, &c.; the\r\nother, the true law courts of the land, administering codes based on\r\nlocal custom and the decrees of the local rulers.\r\n\r\nA rift almost as important entered the legal life of the Moslem lands on\r\nanother side. Non-Moslem communities, settled in Moslem territory, have\r\nbeen uniformly permitted to administer and judge themselves according to\r\ntheir own customs and laws. Save when they come into direct contact and\r\nconflict with Moslems, they are left to themselves with a contemptuous\r\ntolerance. The origin of this attitude in Islam appears to be threefold:\r\n(i) The Islam of theory cannot conceive of a mixed state; it takes\r\naccount, only, of a state containing none but Moslems, and its ideal is\r\nthat the whole world will, in the end, form such a state. In practice,\r\nthen, Moslems try to shut their eyes to the existence of non-Moslems in\r\ntheir midst and make no provision for them until compelled. That a\r\nnon-Moslem should have the same civil position as a Moslem is\r\nunthinkable. (ii) This, of course, produces an attitude of extreme\r\ncontempt. The only citizens are Moslems and all others are to be looked\r\ndown upon and left to themselves. What they do or think among themselves\r\ndoes not matter; they are outside the ring-fence of Islam. (iii) A\r\ndifferent, but equally important, cause is the Moslem indolence. When\r\nthe Arabs conquered, they knew that they must administer the conquered\r\nlands, and they, very wisely, sought help from the machinery which they\r\nfound in operation. But besides the ordinary organization of the state,\r\nthey found also various ecclesiastical organizations, Christian and\r\nJewish, and to these they gave over the administration of the non-Moslem\r\nsections of the community, making their rabbis and bishops their\r\nresponsible heads and the links of contact with the Moslem rulers. They,\r\nunquestionably, found the same method in use by the Byzantine\r\ngovernment; but in Moslem hands it went so far as to make a number of\r\nlittle states (_millet_, _milal_) within the state and effectually to\r\npreclude the possibility of ever welding all the inhabitants of the land\r\ninto one corporate life.\r\n\r\nBut this indolence, when applied to resident aliens, had consequences\r\nstill more serious, because external as well as internal. Following the\r\nsame method of leaving the unbeliever to settle his affairs for himself,\r\nthe European merchant, living and trading in the East, was put first by\r\nusage and finally by treaty under the jurisdiction and control of his\r\nown consul. Thus there grew up the extra-territorial law of the\r\ncapitulations and conventions, by which the sanctity of the person and\r\nhousehold of an ambassador is extended to every European. And this in\r\nturn, has reacted on the status of the non-Moslem subject races, and has\r\ncome to be the indirect but chief support on which they lean. Through\r\nit, an element has developed which makes it practically impossible for a\r\nMoslem state to introduce legal changes even remotely affecting its\r\nnon-Moslem population, alien or subject, without the consent of the\r\nEuropean embassies. Any change may be upset by their refusal to accept\r\nit as incompatible with the capitulations and conventions. The embassies\r\nhave thus, as interpreters of a part, at least, of the constitution,\r\ncome to hold a position remarkably, if absurdly, like that of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States (see Young, _Corps de droit Ottoman,\r\npassim_).\r\n\r\nThere may be said, then, in short, to be three elements in the legal\r\nlife of a Moslem state: the sacred and fixed canon law of Islam; the\r\ncivil law, based on the usages of the different peoples, Moslem and\r\nnon-Moslem, and on statutes going back to the will of rulers; the\r\ninternational law of the capitulations, with a contractual sanction of\r\nits own. The hope for the future in Islam, there can be little doubt,\r\nlies in the principle of the agreement of the Moslem people, with its\r\nconception of catholic unity, and its ability, through that unity, to\r\nmake and abrogate laws. As the Moslem peoples advance, their law can,\r\nthus, advance with them, and the grasp of the dead hand of the canon law\r\nbe gradually and legally released.\r\n\r\n  See I.

Ma.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOMMEDAN RELIGION. The Mahommedan religion is generally known as\r\n_Islam_--the name given to it by Mahomet himself--and meaning the\r\nresigning or submitting oneself to God. The participle of the same\r\nArabic verb, _Muslim_ (in English usually spelt Moslem), is used for one\r\nwho professes this religion. The expression \"Mahommedan religion\" has\r\narisen in the West probably from analogy with \"Christian religion,\" but\r\nis not recognized as a proper one by Moslem writers. Islam claims to be\r\na divinely revealed religion given to the world by Mahomet, who was the\r\nlast of a succession of inspired prophets. Its _doctrine_ and\r\n_practices_ are to be found in (i) the Book of God--the Koran--which was\r\nsent down from the highest heaven to Gabriel in the lowest, who in turn\r\nrevealed it in sections to Mahomet; (2) the collections of tradition\r\n(_hadith_) containing the sayings and manner of life (_sunna_) of the\r\nProphet; (3) the use of analogy (_qiyas_) as applied to (i) and (2); and\r\n(4) the universal consent (_ijma'_) of the believers. The _worship_ of\r\nIslam consists in (1) the recital of the creed; (2) the recital of the\r\nordained prayers; (3) the fast during the month of Ramadhan; (4)\r\nalms-giving; (5) the _hajj_, the pilgrimage to Mecca. The _theology_ of\r\nIslam finds its first public expression among the orthodox in the\r\nteaching of al-Ash`ari (d. after 932), but had its real beginning among\r\nthe sects that arose soon after the death of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nIslam is the latest of the so-called world-religions, and as several of\r\nthe others were practised in Arabia at the time of Mahomet, and the\r\nProphet undoubtedly borrowed some of his doctrines and some of his\r\npractices from these, it is necessary to enumerate them and to indicate\r\nthe extent to which they prevailed in the Arabian world.\r\n\r\n_Relations with Other Religions._--The religions practised in Arabia at\r\nthe time of Mahomet were heathenism, Judaism, Christianity, and\r\nZoroastrianism.\r\n\r\n  i. _Heathenism_ was the religion of the majority of the Arabs. In the\r\n  cities of south Arabia it was a survival from the forms represented in\r\n  the Sabaean, Minaean and Himyaritic inscriptions of south Arabia (see\r\n  ARABIA: _Antiquities_). The more popular form current among the nomads\r\n  is known very imperfectly from the remains of pre-Islamic poetry and\r\n  such works as the _Kitab ul-Asnam_ contained in Yaqut's geography,\r\n  from Shahrastani's work on the sects, and from the few references in\r\n  classical writers. From these we have mostly names of local deities\r\n  (cf. J. Wellhausen, _Reste arabischen Heidentums_, 2nd ed., Berlin,\r\n  1897) and ancient religious customs, which remained in part after the\r\n  introduction of Islam (cf. W. Robertson Smith, _The Religion of the\r\n  Semites_, Edinburgh, 1889, and _Kinship and Marriage in Early Arabia_,\r\n  Cambridge, 1885). From these sources we learn that Arabian religion\r\n  was a nature-worship associated with fetishism. Sun, moon and stars\r\n  were worshipped, some tribes being devoted to the worship of special\r\n  constellations. Certain stones, wells and trees were regarded as\r\n  sacred and as containing a deity. Many (perhaps most) tribes had their\r\n  own idols. Hobal was the chief god of the Ka`ba in Mecca with its\r\n  sacred stone, but round him were grouped a number of other tribal\r\n  idols. It was against this association (_shirk_) of gods that Mahomet\r\n  inveighed in his attempt to unify the religion and polity of the\r\n  Arabs. But there were features in this heathenism favourable to unity,\r\n  and these Mahomet either simply took over into Islam or adapted for\r\n  his purpose. The popularity of the Ka`ba in Mecca as a place of resort\r\n  for worshippers from all parts of Arabia led Mahomet not only to\r\n  institute the _hajj_ as a duty, but also to take over the customs\r\n  connected with the heathen worship of these visits, and later to make\r\n  Mecca the _qibla_, i.e. the place to which his followers turned when\r\n  they prayed. The name of Allah, who seems to have been the god of the\r\n  Koreish (cf. D. S. Margoliouth, _Mohammed_, p. 19, London, 1905), was\r\n  accepted by Mahomet as the name of the one God, though he abandoned\r\n  the corresponding female deity Al-lat.\r\n\r\n  2. _Judaism_ had long been known in Arabia at the time of the Prophet.\r\n  Whether Hebrews settled in Arabia as early as the time of David (cf.\r\n  R. Dozy, _Die Israeliten zu Mecca_, Leipzig, 1864), or not, is of\r\n  little importance here as Judaism cannot be said to have existed until\r\n  the end of the 5th century B.C. The Seleucid persecutions and the\r\n  political troubles that ended with the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70)\r\n  probably sent many Jews to Arabia. In the 5th and 6th centuries the\r\n  history of south Arabia and of Nejran is largely that of the strife\r\n  between Jews and Christians. In the north-west the Jews possessed\r\n  Tema, Khaibar, Yathrib (Medina), Fadak, and other smaller settlements.\r\n  In these they lived as self-contained communities, not seeking to\r\n  proselytize but working at their trades, especially concerned with\r\n  money and jewelry. Mahomet seems to have expected their help in his\r\n  proclamation of monotheism, and his first _qibla_ was Jerusalem. It\r\n  was only when they refused to accept him as prophet that he turned in\r\n  anger against them. They had, however, supplied him with much material\r\n  from the Old Testament, and the stories of creation, the patriarchs\r\n  and early kings and prophets occur continually in the Koran, told\r\n  evidently as they were recited by the common people and with many\r\n  mistakes caused by his own misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n  3. _Christianity_, though later than Judaism, had a sure footing in\r\n  Arabia. It had suffered persecution in Nejran and had been supported\r\n  in the south by the Abyssinian invasions. The kingdom of Hira was\r\n  largely Christian; the same is true of the north Arabian tribes of\r\n  Bakr and Taghlib, and east of the Jordan and on the Syrian boundary as\r\n  well as in Yemama Christianity had made progress. Pre-Islamic\r\n  literature contains many allusions to the teaching and practices of\r\n  Christianity. Of the time of its introduction little is known; little\r\n  also of the form in which it was taught, save that it came from the\r\n  Eastern Church and probably to a large extent through Monophysite and\r\n  Nestorian sects. Tradition says that Mahomet heard Christian preaching\r\n  at the fair of Ukaz, and he probably heard more when he conducted the\r\n  caravans of Khadija. Gospel stories derived apparently from\r\n  uncanonical works, such as the Gospel of the Nativity, occur in the\r\n  Koran. The asceticism of the monks attracted his admiration. A\r\n  mistaken notion of the Trinity was sharply attacked by him. It is\r\n  curious that his followers in the earliest times were called by the\r\n  heathen Arabs, Sabians (q.v.), this being the name of a semi-Christian\r\n  sect. In the time of the Omayyads Christianity led to some of the\r\n  earliest theological sects of Islam (see below).\r\n\r\n  4. _Zoroastrianism_ was known to the Arab tribes in the north-east,\r\n  but does not seem to have exercised any influence in Mecca or Medina\r\n  except indirectly through Judaism in its angelology. As soon, however,\r\n  as the armies of Islam conquered Mesopotamia it began to penetrate the\r\n  thought and practices of Islam (see below).\r\n\r\n_Sources of Authority._--Islam, as we have said, is founded on: (1) the\r\nKoran; (2) the tradition or rather the _sunna_ (manner of life of\r\nMahomet) contained in the tradition (_Hadith_); (3) _ijma`_; the\r\nuniversal agreement; (4) _qiyas_ (analogy).\r\n\r\n1. The _Koran_[1] (properly _Qur'an_ from _qara'a_ to collect, or to\r\nread, recite) is the copy of an uncreated original preserved by God (see\r\nbelow), sent down from the seventh heaven to Gabriel in the first\r\nheaven, and revealed to Mahomet in sections as occasion required. These\r\nrevelations were recited by the Prophet and in many cases written down\r\nat once, though from ii. 100 it would seem that this was not always the\r\ncase. God is the speaker throughout the revelations. It seems probable\r\nthat the whole Koran was written in Mahomet's lifetime, but not brought\r\ntogether as a whole or arranged in order.\r\n\r\n  As it exists now the Koran consists of 114 chapters called _suras_\r\n  (from _sura_, a row of bricks in a wall, a degree or step). The first\r\n  is the _Fatiha_ (opening), which occupies the place of the Lord's\r\n  Prayer in Christianity. The others are arranged generally in order of\r\n  length, the longest coming first, the shortest (often the earliest in\r\n  date) coming at the end. Certain groups, however, indicated by initial\r\n  unvowelled letters, seem to have been kept together from the time of\r\n  the Prophet. At the head of each _sura_ is a title, the place of its\r\n  origin (Mecca or Medina) and the number of its verses (_ayat_)\r\n  together with the formula, \"In the name of God the Merciful, the\r\n  Compassionate\" (except in _sura 9_). For liturgical purposes the whole\r\n  book is divided into 60 sections (_ahzab_) or into 30 divisions\r\n  (_ajza_), each subdivided into a number of prostrations (_ruk`a_ or\r\n  _sajda_). The origin of the collected and written Koran is due to\r\n  Omar, who in the caliphate of Abu Bekr pointed out that many\r\n  possessors of _suras_ were being slain in the battles of Islam and\r\n  their property lost, that there was a danger in this way that much of\r\n  the revelation might disappear, and that men were uncertain what was\r\n  to be accepted as genuine revelation. Accordingly Zaid ibn Thabit who\r\n  had been secretary to Mahomet, was commissioned to collect all he\r\n  could find of the revelation. His work seems to have been simply that\r\n  of a collector. He seems to have done his work thoroughly and made a\r\n  copy of the whole for Abu Bekr. The collection was thus chiefly a\r\n  private matter, and this copy passed after Abu Bekr's death into the\r\n  hands of Omar, and after his death to Hafsa, daughter of Omar, a widow\r\n  of Mahomet. In the caliphate of Othman it was discovered that there\r\n  were serious differences between the readings of the Koran possessed\r\n  by the Syrian troops and those of the Eastern soldiers, and Othman was\r\n  urged to have a copy prepared which should be authoritative for the\r\n  Moslem world. He appointed Zaid ibn Thabit and three members of the\r\n  tribe of Koreish (Quraish) to do the work. Each of these made a copy\r\n  of Abu Bekr's collection, carefully preserving Koreishite forms of\r\n  words. How far the text was amended by the help of other copies is\r\n  doubtful; in any case the mode of procedure was undoubtedly very\r\n  conservative. The four similar manuscripts were sent, one each to\r\n  Medina, Cufa (Kufa), Basra and Damascus, and an order was issued that\r\n  all differing copies should be destroyed. In spite of the personal\r\n  unpopularity of Othman this recension was adopted by the Moslem world\r\n  and remains the only standard text. A few variant readings and\r\n  differences of order of the _suras_ in the collections of Ubay ibn\r\n  Ka`b and of Ibn Mas`ud were, however, known to later commentators. The\r\n  only variants after the time of Othman were owing to different\r\n  possible ways of pronouncing the consonantal text. These are usually\r\n  of little importance for the meaning. As the text is now always\r\n  vowelled, variations are found in the vowels of different copies, and\r\n  the opinions of seven leading \"readers\" are regarded as worthy of\r\n  respect by commentators (see Th. Nöldeke, _Geschichte des Qorans_, pp.\r\n  279 seq., Göttingen, 1860). Various characteristics enable one to\r\n  establish with more or less certainty the relative chronological order\r\n  of the _suras_ in the Koran, at any rate so far as to place them in\r\n  the first or second Meccan period or that of Medina. The form of the\r\n  sentences is a guide, for the earliest parts are usually written in\r\n  the _saj`_ form (see ARABIA: _Literature_). The expressions used also\r\n  help; thus the \"O ye people\" of the Meccan period is replaced in the\r\n  Medina _suras_ by \"O ye who believe.\" The oaths in the first Meccan\r\n  period are longer, in the second shorter, and are absent in the\r\n  Medinan. In the earliest period the style is more elevated and\r\n  passionate. Occasionally the time of origin is determined by reference\r\n  to historical events. In accordance with such principles of criticism\r\n  two leading scholars, Nöldeke (_loc. cit._) and H. Grimme (in his\r\n  _Mohammed Zweiter Teil_. _Einleitung in den Koran. System der\r\n  koranischen Theologie_, Münster, 1895), have arranged the _suras_ as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Order of Suras in Koran._\r\n\r\n  NÖLDEKE.\r\n\r\n  _Mecca._\r\n\r\n  1st to 5th yr.

It must, however,\r\nbe borne in mind that orthodox Islam recognizes the Koran as the work\r\nnot of Mahomet but of God. Yet Moslem theologians recognize that some\r\nrevelations are inconsistent with others, and so have developed the\r\ndoctrine of _nasikh_ and _mansukh_ (\"abrogating\" and \"abrogated\"),\r\nwhereby it is taught that in certain definite cases a later revelation\r\nsupersedes an earlier. A critical study of the Koran shows in the\r\nearlier revelations the marks of a reflective mind trained under the\r\ninfluence of Arabian education and stirred by an acquaintance (somewhat\r\nimperfect) with Judaism and Christianity. The later revelations seem to\r\nbe influenced by the now dominant position of the Prophet and a desire\r\nafter the capture of Mecca to incorporate such heathen religious\r\nceremonies as are national. God is one and universal from the beginning.\r\nHis unity is emphasized as against the mistaken conception of the\r\nChristian Trinity. At first his might is taught by the name _Rabb_\r\n(Lord) which is generally used with an attribute as \"the highest Lord,\"\r\n\"Lord of the worlds,\" \"Lord of men,\" \"Lord of heaven and earth,\" \"Lord\r\nof the East and West,\" or \"our Lord.\" Then he is identified with the god\r\nAllah (see above) and the first part of the later Moslem creed is\r\nannounced--_la ilaha illa-llaha_, \"there is no god but Allah.\" But every\r\nact of creation is a proof not only of God's power but also of his\r\nbeneficence (xiv. 37), and so he becomes known as _ar-Rahman_, \"the\r\nCompassionate.\" The attributes of God may all be arranged in the three\r\nclasses of his power, unity and goodness. They are expressed by the\r\nninety-nine \"beautiful names\" applied to him in the Koran (see E. H.\r\nPalmer, _The Quran_ in \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. vi., Introd. pp.\r\n67-68, Oxford, 1880). In the Medina period of Mahomet's life the nature\r\nof God is not so clear, and the description of it varies according to\r\nthe moods of the Prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spirits.\r\n\r\nBeside God are two other uncreated beings: (1) the original of the\r\nKoran, the \"mother of the Book\" (xliii. 3) on a \"preserved tablet\"\r\n(_lauh mahfuz_) (lxxxv. 22), in accordance with which God acts, and (2)\r\nthe throne (_kursi_) (ii. 256). When the heavens are created, God sits\r\non his throne in the seventh heaven; around him are angels, pure,\r\nsexless beings, some of whom bear the throne, while some are engaged in\r\npraising him continually. They are also his messengers and are sent to\r\nfight with the believers against the heathen. Some are the guardian\r\nangels of men, others are the watchmen of hell. Mediate beings between\r\nGod and man are the \"word\" (_amr_) and from it the \"spirit\" (_ruh_) or\r\n\"holy spirit\" (_ruh ul-qudus_). Another manifestation of God to the\r\nbelievers only is the \"glory\" (_sakina_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cosmology.\r\n\r\n  Ethics.\r\n\r\nGod created the world in six days according to the plan of the Book. Each\r\nnew life was created by God's breathing into it a soul. The duality of\r\nsoul and body is maintained. In each man is a good and a bad impulse. The\r\nbad impulse which was latent in Adam was roused to action by Satan\r\n(_Iblis_). Adam by his fall lost the grace of God, which was restored to\r\nhim solely by the gracious choice of God. Between men and angels in their\r\nnature are the genii (_jinn_) male and female, inhabitants of desert\r\nplaces, created from smokeless fire. They had been accustomed to spy\r\nround heaven, but in Mahomet's time could learn no more of its secrets.\r\nSome of them were converted by the Prophet's teaching. Lowest of creation\r\nin his estate is Satan (_Shaitan_), who was an angel but was expelled\r\nfrom heaven because he refused to worship Adam at his Lord's command. God\r\nhas revealed himself to man by (1) writing (_kitab_), and (2) prophets.\r\nAs he had given to the Jews the Law (_Taurat_) and to the Christians the\r\nGospel (_Injil_) so he revealed to Mahomet the Koran (Qur`an, known also\r\nby other names, e.g. _al-Furqan_, _at-Tafsil_, &c.), each single\r\nrevelation being called an aya. With his revelation God has also sent an\r\napostle or prophet to each people. Several of these are mentioned in the\r\nKoran, Moses the prophet of the Jews, Jesus (_Isa_) that of the\r\nChristians. Mahomet is not only the apostle of the Moslems but the \"seal\r\nof the prophets,\" i.e. the final member of the class. His mission at\r\nfirst was to warn men of imminent judgment. Later he became more of a\r\nteacher. At first he seems to have relied for the salvation of men on his\r\nnatural faculties, but later announced the doctrine of God's election.\r\nThe ethics of the Koran are based on belief (_iman_) and good works, the\r\nlatter alone occurring in the early Meccan _suras_. Fear of the judgment\r\nof God was a motive of action; this is followed by repentance and turning\r\nto God. A complete surrender to God's will (_islam_) is the necessary\r\ncondition of religious life and is expressed in the phrase so common in\r\neveryday speech among the Moslems--_inshallah_, \"if God will.\" God has\r\nfull power to overlook evil deeds if he will. Unbelievers can acquire no\r\nmerit, however moral their actions. A short account of the chief ethical\r\nrequirements of the Koran is given in xvii. 23-40:--\r\n\r\n  \"Put not God with other gods, or thou wilt sit despised and forsaken.\r\n  Thy Lord has decreed that ye shall not serve other than Him; and\r\n  kindness to one's parents, whether one or both of them reach old age\r\n  with thee, and say not to them, 'Fie,' and do not grumble at them, but\r\n  speak to them a generous speech. And lower to them the wing of\r\n  humility out of compassion, and say, 'O Lord! have compassion on them\r\n  as they brought me up when I was little!' Your Lord knows best what is\r\n  in your souls if ye be righteous, and, verily, He is forgiving unto\r\n  those who come back penitent.\r\n\r\n  \"And give thy kinsman his due and the poor and the son of the road;\r\n  and waste not wastefully, for the wasteful were ever the devil's\r\n  brothers, and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.\r\n\r\n  \"But if thou dost turn away from them to seek after mercy from thy\r\n  Lord, which thou hopest for, then speak to them an easy speech.\r\n\r\n  \"Make not thy hand fettered to thy neck, nor yet spread it out quite\r\n  open, lest thou shouldest have to sit down blamed and straightened in\r\n  means. Verily, thy Lord spreads out provision to whomsoever He will or\r\n  He doles it out. Verily, He is ever well aware of and sees His\r\n  servants.\r\n\r\n  \"And slay not your children for fear of poverty; we will provide for\r\n  them; beware! for to slay them is ever a great sin.\r\n\r\n  \"And draw not near to fornication; verily, it is ever an abomination,\r\n  and evil is the way thereof.\r\n\r\n  \"And slay not the soul that God has forbidden you, except for just\r\n  cause; for he who is slain unjustly we have given his next of kin\r\n  authority; yet let him not exceed in slaying; verily, he is ever\r\n  helped.\r\n\r\n  \"And draw not near to the wealth of the orphan, save to improve it,\r\n  until he reaches the age of puberty, and fulfil your compacts; verily,\r\n  a compact is ever enquired of.\r\n\r\n  \"And give full measure when ye measure out, and weigh with a right\r\n  balance; that is better and a fairer determination.\r\n\r\n  \"And do not pursue that of which thou hast no knowledge; verily, the\r\n  hearing, the sight and the heart, all of these shall be enquired of.\r\n\r\n  \"And walk not on the earth proudly; verily, thou canst not cleave the\r\n  earth, and thou shalt not reach the mountains in height.\r\n\r\n  \"All this is ever evil in the sight of your Lord and abhorred.\"\r\n\r\n  (E. H. Palmer's translation.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Eschatology.\r\n\r\nThe eschatology of the Koran is especially prominent in its earlier\r\nparts. The resurrection, last judgment, paradise and hell are all\r\ndescribed. At death the body again becomes earth, while the soul sinks\r\ninto a state of sleep or unconsciousness. At a time decreed, known as\r\n\"the hour\" (_as-Sa`a_), \"the day of resurrection\" (_yaum ul-qiyyama_),\r\n\"day of judgment\" (_yaum-ud-din_), &c., an angel will call or will sound\r\na trumpet, the earth will be broken up, and the soul will rejoin the\r\nbody. God will appear on his throne with angels. The great book will be\r\nopened, and a list of his deeds will be given to every man, to the good\r\nin his right hand, to the evil in his left (_sura 69_). A balance will\r\nbe used to weigh the deeds. The _jinn_ will testify against the\r\nidolaters. The righteous will then obtain eternal peace and joy in the\r\ngarden (_al-janna_) and the wicked will be cast into the fiery ditch\r\n(_Jahannam_), where pains of body and of soul are united.\r\n\r\n2. The _Tradition._--The revelation of God is twofold--in a writing and\r\nby a prophet. The former was contained in the Koran, the latter was\r\nknown from the actions of Mahomet in the different circumstances of\r\nlife. The manner of life of the Prophet (_sunna_) was contained in the\r\ntradition (_al-hadith_). The information required was at first naturally\r\nobtained by word of mouth from the companions and helpers of Mahomet.\r\nThese in turn bequeathed their information to their younger companions,\r\nwho quoted traditions and gave decisions in their names.\r\n\r\n  For long these traditions circulated orally, the authority of each\r\n  depending on the person who first gave it and the reliability of the\r\n  chain (_isnad_) of men who had passed it on from him. At first this\r\n  tradition was regarded as explanatory of, or at the most supplementary\r\n  to, the teaching of the Koran. Early Moslem teachers pointed to the\r\n  Jews as having two law-books--the _Taurat_ and the _Mishna_--while\r\n  Islam had only one--the Koran. But opinion changed, the value of\r\n  tradition as an independent revelation came to be more highly esteemed\r\n  until at last it was seriously discussed whether a tradition might not\r\n  abrogate a passage of the Koran with which it was at variance. The\r\n  writing of traditions was at first strongly discouraged, and for more\r\n  than a century the stories of the Prophet's conduct passed from mouth\r\n  to mouth. Had all the narrators been pious men, this might have been\r\n  tolerable, but this was not the case. The Omayyad dynasty was not a\r\n  pious one. Men who were not religious but wished to appear so invented\r\n  traditions to justify their manner of life. The sectarians did not\r\n  hesitate to adopt the same means of spreading their own teaching. Many\r\n  Moslem writers testify to the fact that forged traditions were\r\n  circulated, and that religious opinion was confused thereby. The need\r\n  for some sort of authoritative collection seems to have been felt by\r\n  the one pious Omayyad caliph, Omar II. (717-720), who is said to have\r\n  ordered Ibn Shihab uz-Zuhri to make such a collection. Of this work,\r\n  if it was carried out, we know nothing further. It was, however, by a\r\n  man born during this reign that the first systematic collection of\r\n  traditions was made--the _Muwatta`_ of Malik ibn Anas (q.v.). Yet this\r\n  work is not a book of tradition in the religious sense, it is really a\r\n  corpus juris and not a complete one. The object of Malik was simply to\r\n  record every tradition that had been used to give effect to a legal\r\n  decision. The work of sifting the vast mass of traditions and\r\n  arranging them according to their relation to the different parts of\r\n  religious life and practice was first undertaken in the 3rd century of\r\n  Islam (A.D. 815-912). In this century all the six collections\r\n  afterwards regarded as canonical by the Sunnites (orthodox) were made.\r\n  By this time an immense number of traditions was in circulation.\r\n  Bukhari in the course of sixteen years' journeying through Moslem\r\n  lands collected 600,000, and of these included 7275 (or, allowing for\r\n  repetitions, 4000) in his work. The six collections of tradition\r\n  received by the Sunnites as authoritative are: (i) The _Kitab ul-jami`\r\n  us-Sahih_ of Bukhari (q.v.) (810-870). This is the most respected\r\n  throughout the Moslem world and most carefully compiled (ed. L. Krehl\r\n  and T. W. Juynboll, Leiden, 1862--and frequently in the East; also\r\n  with many commentaries. French translation by O. Houdas and W.\r\n  Marcais, Paris, 1903 sqq.). (ii) The _Sahih_ of Muslim (817-875) with\r\n  an introduction on the science of tradition (ed. Calcutta, 1849, &c.).\r\n  (iii) The _Kitab us-Sunan_ of Abu Da`ud (817-888) (ed. Cairo, 1863,\r\n  Lucknow, 1888, Delhi, 1890). (iv) The _Jami` us-Sahih_ of Tirmidhi\r\n  (q.v.). (v) _The Kitab us-Sunan_ of Nasa` i (830-915) (ed. Cairo,\r\n  1894). (vi) The _Kitab us-Sunan_ of Ibn Maja (824-866) (ed. Delhi,\r\n  1865 and 1889). The last four are not held in the same repute as the\r\n  first two.\r\n\r\n3. _Ijma`_ is the universal consent which is held to justify practices\r\nor beliefs, although they are not warranted by the Koran or tradition,\r\nand may be inconsistent with the apparent teaching of one or both of\r\nthese. These beliefs and practices, which had often come from the\r\npre-Islamic customs of those who had become believers, seem to have\r\nescaped notice until the Abbasid period. They were too deeply rooted in\r\nthe lives of men to be abolished. It became necessary either to find a\r\ntradition to abrogate the earlier forbidding one, or to acknowledge that\r\n_ijma`_ is higher than the tradition. The former expedient was resorted\r\nto by some later theologians (e.g. Nawawi) by a fiction that such a\r\ntradition existed though it was not found now in writing. But in earlier\r\ntimes some (as Ibn Qutaiba) had adopted the latter alternative, saying\r\nthat the truth can be derived much earlier from the _ijma`_ than from\r\nthe tradition, because it is not open to the same chances of corruption\r\nin its transmission as the latter. Tradition itself was found to confirm\r\nthis view, for the Prophet is related to have said, \"My people does not\r\nagree to an error.\"\r\n\r\n  But _ijma`_ itself has been used in different senses: (i) The _ijma`_\r\n  of Medina was used to indicate the authority coming from the practices\r\n  of the people of Medina (see below). (ii) The _ijma`_ of the whole\r\n  community of Moslems is that most commonly recognized. It was used to\r\n  support fealty to the Abbasid dynasty. By it the six books of\r\n  tradition mentioned above are recognized as authoritative, and it is\r\n  the justification of the conception of Mahomet as superhuman. (iii)\r\n  Some of the more thoughtful theologians recognize only the _ijma`_ of\r\n  the doctors or the teachers of Islam (the _mujtahidun_), these being\r\n  restricted by the orthodox to the first few generations after Mahomet,\r\n  while the Shi`ites allow the existence of such up to the present time.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth basis of Islam is _qiyas_, i.e. analogy. It is that\r\nprocess by which a belief or practice is justified on the ground of\r\nsomething similar but not identical in the Koran, the tradition or\r\n_ijma`_. Originally it seems to have been instituted as a check upon the\r\nuse of private opinion (_ra'y_) in the teaching of doctrine. The extent\r\nto which it may be used is a subject of much discussion among\r\ntheologians. Some would apply it only to a \"material similarity,\" others\r\nto similarity of motive or cause as well.\r\n\r\n_Worship and Ritual._--The acts of worship required by Islam are five in\r\nnumber: (i) the recital of the creed; (ii.) observance of the five daily\r\nprayers; (iii) the fast in the month of Ramadhan; (iv) giving of the\r\nlegal alms; (v) the pilgrimage to Mecca.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Creed.\r\n\r\n  i. The creed is belief--\"la ilaha illa-llahu, Muhammad rasul allahi,\"\r\n  \"there is no god but God (Allah), Mahomet is the apostle of God.\" It\r\n  is required that this shall be recited at least once in a lifetime\r\n  aloud, correctly, with full understanding of its meaning and with\r\n  heartfelt belief in its truth. It is to be professed without\r\n  hesitation at any time until death.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Prayer.\r\n\r\n  ii. Every man who professes Islam is required in ordinary life to pray\r\n  five times in each day. In the Koran these prayers are commanded,\r\n  though four only are mentioned. \"Wherefore glorify God, when the\r\n  evening overtaketh you, and when ye rise in the morning, and unto Him\r\n  be praise in Heaven and earth; and in the evening and when ye rest at\r\n  noon\" (xxx. 16-17), but commentators say the \"evening\" includes the\r\n  sunset and after sunset. The five times therefore are: (1) Dawn or\r\n  just before sunrise, (2) just after noon, (3) before sunset, (4) just\r\n  after sunset, and (5) just after the day has closed. Tradition decides\r\n  within what limits the recitals may be delayed without impairing their\r\n  validity. Prayer is preceded by the lesser ablution (_wadu_)\r\n  consisting in the washing of face, hands (to the elbows) and feet in\r\n  prescribed manner. Complete washing of the body (_ghusl_) is required\r\n  only after legal pollution. In prayer the worshipper faces the _qibla_\r\n  (direction of prayer), which was at first Jerusalem, but was changed\r\n  by the Prophet to Mecca. In a mosque the _qibla_ is indicated by a\r\n  niche (_mihrab_) in one of the walls. The prayers consist of\r\n  prescribed ejaculations, petitions, and the recital of parts of the\r\n  Koran, always including the first _sura_, accompanied by prostrations\r\n  of the body. Detailed physical positions are prescribed for each part\r\n  of the worship; these vary slightly in the four orthodox schools (see\r\n  below). On a journey, in time of war or in other special\r\n  circumstances, the set form of prayers may be modified in accordance\r\n  with appointed rules. Besides these private prayers, there is the\r\n  prayer of the assembly, which is observed on a Friday (_yaum\r\n  ul-jam'a_, \"the day of assembly\") in a mosque, and is usually\r\n  accompanied by an address or declamation (_khutba_) delivered from a\r\n  step of the pulpit (_minbar_). Special prayers are also prescribed for\r\n  certain occasions, as on the eclipse of the sun or the moon, &c. Among\r\n  the Sufis special attention is given to informal prayer, consisting\r\n  chiefly in the continual repetition of the name of God (_dhikr_) (see\r\n  SUFI'ISM). This is still a characteristic of some of the dervish\r\n  (q.v.) communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fasting.\r\n\r\n  iii. The command to fast begins with the words, \"O ye who believe!\r\n  There is prescribed for you the fast, as it was prescribed for those\r\n  before you.\" The expression \"those before you\" has been taken to refer\r\n  to the Jews, who fasted on the day of atonement, but more probably\r\n  refers to the long fast of thirty-six days observed by the Eastern\r\n  Christians. In the passage of the Koran referred to (ii. 179-181)\r\n  Moslems are required to fast during the month of Ramadhan, \"wherein\r\n  the Koran was revealed,\" but if one is on a journey or sick he may\r\n  fast \"another number of days,\" and if he is able to fast and does not,\r\n  \"he may redeem it by feeding a poor man,\" but \"if ye fast, it is\r\n  better for you.\" This fast was probably instituted in the second year\r\n  at Medina. At that time the corrected lunar year was in use and\r\n  Ramadhan, the ninth month, was always in the winter. A few years later\r\n  Mahomet decreed the use of the uncorrected lunar year, which remains\r\n  the standard of time for the Moslem world, so that the month of\r\n  fasting now occurs at all seasons of the year in turn. The fast is\r\n  severe, and means entire abstinence from food and drink from sunrise\r\n  to sunset each day of the month. The fast is associated with the\r\n  statement that in this month God sent down the Koran from the seventh\r\n  heaven to Gabriel in the lowest that it might be revealed to the\r\n  Prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alms.\r\n\r\n  iv. Alms are of two kinds: (1) the legal and determined (_zakat_), and\r\n  (2) voluntary (_sadaqat_). The former were given in cattle, grain,\r\n  fruit, merchandise and money once a year after a year's possession.\r\n  For cattle a somewhat elaborate scale is adopted. Of grain and fruit a\r\n  tenth is given if watered by rain, a twentieth if the result of\r\n  irrigation. Of the value of merchandise and of money a fortieth is\r\n  prescribed. In the early days of Islam the alms were collected by\r\n  officials and used for the building of mosques and similar religious\r\n  purposes. At the present time the carrying of these prescriptions is\r\n  left to the conscience of the believers, who pay the alms to any needy\r\n  fellow-Moslem. A good example of a _sadaqa_ is found in a gift to an\r\n  unbeliever (see C. M. Doughty, _Arabia deserta_, i. 446, ii. 278,\r\n  Cambridge, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n  v. The fifth religious duty of the Moslem is the pilgrimage (_hajj_)\r\n  to Mecca, which should be performed once by every Moslem \"if he is\r\n  able,\" that is if he can provide or obtain the means to support\r\n  himself on pilgrimage and his family during his absence, and if he is\r\n  physically capable. The pilgrimage is made at one time of the (Moslem)\r\n  year, namely, from the 7th to the 10th of the month Dhu'l-Hijja. For\r\n  the arrangements for the journey from various countries to Mecca see\r\n  CARAVAN. When the pilgrim arrives within five or six miles of the holy\r\n  city he puts off his ordinary dress after ablution and prayer, and\r\n  puts on the two seamless wrappers which form the dress of the pilgrim\r\n  (the _ihram_), who goes without head-covering or boots or shoes. He\r\n  must not shave at all, or trim the nails or anoint the head during the\r\n  ceremonial period. The chief parts of the ceremonial are the visit to\r\n  the sacred mosque (_masjid ul-haram_), the kissing of the black stone,\r\n  the compassing of the Ka`ba (the _Tawaf_) seven times, three times\r\n  running, four times slowly, the visit to the Maqam Ibrahim, the ascent\r\n  of Mount Safa and running from it to Mount Marwa seven times, the run\r\n  to Mount `Arafat, hearing a sermon, and going to Muzdalifa, where he\r\n  stays the night, the throwing of stones at the three pillars in Mina\r\n  on the great feast day, and the offering of sacrifice there (for the\r\n  localities see MECCA). After the accomplishment of these ceremonies\r\n  the ordinary dress is resumed, the pilgrimage is finished, but the\r\n  pilgrim usually remains another three days in Mecca, then visits\r\n  Medina to pay his respects to the tomb of Mahomet. Beside the _hajj_\r\n  (great pilgrimage) Islam also recognizes the merit of the _`umra_ (or\r\n  lesser pilgrimage), i.e. a religious visit to Mecca at any time\r\n  accompanied by most of the ceremonies of the _hajj_.\r\n\r\n  The ceremonies of the _hajj_ have been described by several European\r\n  travellers who have witnessed them, such as J. L. Burckhardt in 1814,\r\n  Sir Richard Burton in 1853 (see bibliography to MECCA). A concise\r\n  account of them is given in T. P. Hughes, _Notes on Muhammadanism_\r\n  (3rd ed., London, 1894). Details in vol. i. of Bukhari's traditions\r\n  (Houdas and Marcais's French translation, i. 493-567).\r\n\r\n_The Development of Islam._--The battle of Siffin (657) between `Ali and\r\nMoawiya was the occasion of the first breach in the unity of Islam, and\r\nthe results remain to this day. The occasion was in the first case\r\npolitical, but politics were at that time too intimately connected with\r\nreligion to be considered apart from it. After the battle (see\r\nCALIPHATE) `Ali was practically compelled to submit his claims to\r\narbitration, whereupon a number of his supporters broke away from him,\r\nsaying that there should have been no appeal save to the Book of God.\r\nThese men were for the most part country Arabs, and, inspired by the\r\nfree spirit of the desert, were democratic, claiming that the caliph\r\nshould be elected by the whole community from any family (and not from\r\nthe Koreish alone), and that the caliph might be deposed for sin. A few\r\nextremists were republicans and would do without a caliph altogether.\r\nThe whole party was known as the Kharijites (Kharijiyya or Khawarij).\r\nThe Moslems who disagreed with them were regarded by them as renegades\r\nand were to be put to death. They were soon divided into extremists and\r\nmoderates. The former put to death the children of unbelievers and\r\nrefused to hold intercourse in daily life with unbelievers. The\r\nmoderates, who came to be known as Ibadites (from their leader `Abdallah\r\nibn `Ibad), would allow the children of unbelievers to grow up, and\r\nwould then deal with them according to their choice. In ordinary life\r\nthey would mix with all men, but marriage with other Moslems outside\r\ntheir own ranks was forbidden. These still remain in Oman, parts of\r\nAlgeria and East Africa.\r\n\r\nAnother party, consisting mainly of city Arabs infected with Persian\r\nideas as to the divinity of the ruler, clung to `Ali with inconvenient\r\naffection. They regarded `Ali and his descendants as the only legitimate\r\ncaliphs, and came to be known as Shi`ites (q.v.). They remain to-day the\r\nlargest part of Islam outside orthodoxy. During the Omayyad caliphate\r\n(661-750) there were three centres of religious thought and influence;\r\nstudents and teachers often passed from one to the other, thus making\r\nuniversal the teachings which in their origin were due to local\r\ncircumstances. These centres were Damascus (the seat of the caliphate),\r\nMedina and the East (Irak, &c.). In Damascus the court was worldly and\r\nindifferent to the interests of Islam. The early Omayyads were\r\ndistinguished for their striving after dominion (_mulk_). Instead of\r\nattempting to propagate Islam, they tolerated other religions and\r\nfavoured Christians who were distinguished as poets (e.g. Akhtal) or\r\nofficials (John of Damascus), or men likely to be of use to them in any\r\nway. The doctrines of Christianity began to influence even serious\r\nMoslems and to affect their way of stating Moslem belief. John of\r\nDamascus (d. before 767), the Greek theologian, and his pupil, Theodorus\r\nAbucara (d. 826), have written controversial works on Islam, from which\r\nit seems probable that disputations on subjects pertaining to religion\r\nwere held between Christians and Moslems. Two schools of heretical\r\nMoslem sects arose under these influences--that of the Murjiites and\r\nthat of the Qadarites. The Murjiites (\"postponers\") were so called\r\nbecause they postponed the judgment of human actions until the Day of\r\nJudgment. In politics they accepted the Omayyads as _de facto_ rulers,\r\nsince they were Moslems, and left the judgment of their actions to God.\r\nAs theologians they taught that religion consists in belief (_iman_) in\r\nthe unity of God and in his apostle, and in that alone, consequently no\r\none who held this faith would perish eternally, though he had been a\r\nsinner. This was opposed to the Kharijite doctrine that the unrepentant\r\nsinner would perish eternally, even though he had professed Islam.\r\n\r\nThe Qadarites were concerned with the doctrine of predestination and\r\nfree-will. So long as Moslems were fighting the battles of Islam they\r\nnaturally paid most attention to those revelations which laid stress on\r\nthe absolute determination of a man's destiny by God. They fought with\r\ngreat bravery because they believed that God had foreordained their\r\ndeath or life and they could not escape His will. In the quieter realm\r\nof town and court life and in their disputations with Christians they\r\nwere called upon to reconcile this belief with the appeals made in the\r\nKoran to man's own self-determination to good, to courage, &c. Mahomet\r\nwas not a systematic theologian and had done nothing to help them. The\r\nQadarites declared that man had power over his own actions. But the\r\nteaching of predestination had gained too great a hold on Moslems to be\r\nthus displaced. The teaching of the Qadarites was held to be heresy, and\r\none of its first professors, Ma`bad ul-Juhani, was put to death in\r\n699.[3] During this period Medina was the home of tradition. Those who\r\nhad been in closest relation with the Prophet dwelt there. The very\r\npeople of the city derived a certain splendour and authority from the\r\nfact that Mahomet had lived and was buried there. Free thought in\r\nreligion had little chance of arising, less of expressing itself, in the\r\nholy city. But the Koran was diligently studied, traditions were\r\ncollected (and invented) though not yet written in books, and innovation\r\n(_bid`a_) was resolutely avoided. At the same time it really did\r\ncontribute a new element to religious practice, for the custom (_ijma`_,\r\nsee above) of Medina gained a certain authority even in Syria and the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIn the East, on the other hand, there was more mental activity, and the\r\nreligious teachers who came from Medina had to be prepared to meet with\r\nmany questions. The wits of the Moslems were sharpened by daily contact\r\nwith Christians, Buddhists, Manichaeans and Zoroastrians. Hasan ul-Basri\r\n(q.v.), who has been claimed as one of the first mystics, also as one of\r\nthe first systematic theologians of Islam, was remarkable alike for his\r\npersonal piety and his orthodoxy. Yet it was among his pupils that the\r\ngreat rationalist movement originated. Its founder was Wasil ibn `Ata,\r\nwho separated himself (whence his followers were called Motazilites,\r\nstrictly Mu`tazilites, \"Separatists\") from his teacher and founded a\r\nschool which became numerous and influential. The Mu`tazilites objected\r\nto the attributes of God being considered in any way as entities beside\r\nGod; they explained away the anthropomorphisms used in speaking of the\r\ndeity; they regarded the Koran as created and as a product of Mahomet\r\nwriting under the divine influence. Briefly, they asserted the supremacy\r\nof reason (_`aql_) as distinct from faith received by tradition\r\n(_naql_). They also called themselves \"the people of justice and unity\"\r\n(_Ahl ul-`adl wat-tauhid_). Such a faith as this naturally found favour\r\nrather with the thinking classes than with the uneducated multitude, and\r\nso went through many vicissitudes. At the time of its appearance and\r\nuntil the reign of Ma`mun its adherents were persecuted as heretics.\r\nAfter discussions among the theologians Ma`mun took the decided step of\r\nproclaiming that the Koran was created, and that a belief in this dogma\r\nwas necessary. Other Mu`tazilite doctrines were proclaimed later.\r\nMu`tazilites were appointed to official posts, and an inquisition\r\n(_mihna_) was appointed to enforce belief in their doctrines. This\r\nmovement was strongly opposed by the orthodox and especially by Ahmad\r\nibn Hanbal (q.v.). By him the founding of theology on reason was\r\nrejected, and he suffered persecution for his faith (see W. N. Patton,\r\n_Ahmed ibn Hanbal and the Mihna_, Leiden, 1897). Mu`tazilism retained\r\nits sway until 849, when the caliph Motawakkil again declared the Koran\r\nuncreate and restored orthodoxy. It was during the early years of the\r\nAbbasid rule that the four legal schools of Abu Hanifa (d. 767), Malik\r\nibn Anas (d. 795), ash-Shafi'i (d. 819) and Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) came\r\ninto existence (see MAHOMMEDAN LAW). As the bases of religion and law\r\nwere the same, so the methods applied in the treatment of the one\r\naffected the other. Abu Hanifa depended little on tradition, but\r\nreferred back to the Koran, making use of individual opinion (_ra`y_) as\r\ncontrolled by analogy (_qiyas_) with a written ordinance. Malik Ibn Anas\r\nsupplemented the Koran and Sunna by customary law founded largely on the\r\ncustom (_ijma`_) of Medina, and by what he conceived to be for the\r\npublic good (_istislah_). Shafi`i recognized tradition as equal to the\r\nKoran, and even as being able to supersede its ordinances, while he also\r\nrecognized the universal custom (_ijma`_) of the Moslem world as divine\r\nand binding. His four bases of religion--Koran, sunna, qiyas and\r\nijma`--have been generally accepted in Islam (see above). Ibn Hanbal's\r\nposition has been already mentioned. All these four schools are reckoned\r\northodox, and all orthodox Moslems belong to one or another of them.\r\nAnother teacher of this time, who founded a school which did not succeed\r\nin being recognized as orthodox, was Da`ud uz-Zahiri. Trained as a\r\nShafi`ite, he became too strict for this school, rejected analogy,\r\nrestricted _ijma`_ to the agreement or custom of the companions of\r\nMahomet, and accepted the whole of the Koran and tradition in the most\r\nliteral and external sense. His followers were called Zahirites (i.e.\r\nexternalists). After Ash`ari's time these principles were applied to\r\ntheology by Ibn Hazm (q.v.) see I. Goldziher, _Die Zahiriten, ihr\r\nLehrsystem und ihre Geschichte_ (Leipzig, 1884).\r\n\r\nBefore turning to the reform of Ash`ari and the introduction into\r\northodox theology of scholastic philosophy it is necessary to notice\r\nanother phase of religious life which became the common property of\r\northodox and heretics. This was the introduction of asceticism in\r\nreligions practice and of mysticism in religious thought. Sufi`ism\r\n(q.v.), which combined these two, is rightly not counted among the sects\r\nof Islam. Asceticism seems to have won a certain amount of approval from\r\nMahomet himself, who much respected the Christian monks. The attention\r\npaid in early Islam to the joys and punishments of the future life led\r\nto self-denial and simple living in this world. An Arabian writer,\r\nspeaking of the simplicity of manners of the first four caliphs, says\r\nthat their affairs were conducted with more consideration of the future\r\nlife than of this world. Many Moslems went even farther than these\r\ncaliphs, and gave up all concern as far as possible with the affairs of\r\nthis world and lived in poverty, in wanderings or in retirement (see\r\nDERVISH). For the historical development of this movement, with its\r\naccompanying mysticism, see SUFI`ISM. Ash`ari (d. before 942) was for\r\nforty years a Mu`tazilite, then became orthodox (see ASH`ARI), and at\r\nonce applied rational methods for the support and interpretation of the\r\northodox faith. Before him, reason had not been allowed any scope in\r\northodox theology. He was not the first to use it; some teachers (as\r\nal-Junaid) had employed it in teaching, but only in secret and for the\r\nfew. The methods of scholastic philosophy were now introduced into\r\nMoslem theology. The chief characteristic of his religious teaching was\r\nthe adoption of the _via media_ between materialistic grossness and the\r\nideas of pure speculative philosophy. Thus he taught, as to the\r\nattributes of God, that they exist, but are not to be compared with\r\nhuman attributes; as to His visibility, that He can be seen but without\r\nthe limitations of human sight. As to the great question of free will,\r\nhe denied man's power but asserted his responsibility. So he passed in\r\nreview the doctrines of God, faith, the Koran, sin, intercession, &c.,\r\nand for the first time in the history of Islam produced a systematic\r\ntheology. The teaching of Ash`ari was taken up and propagated by the\r\nBuyids soon after his death, and was developed and perfected by Abu Bekr\r\nul-Baqilani, the Cadi (d. 1012), but up to the middle of the 5th century\r\nof Islam (c. A.D. 1058) was suspected elsewhere and confounded with\r\nMu`tazilism. The Ash`arite al-Juwaini (known as Imam ul-Haramain) was\r\npersecuted under Toghrul Beg (c. 1053) and exiled, but was restored\r\nunder Alp Arslan by the vizier Nizam ul-Mulk, who founded an Ash`arite\r\ncollege (the Nizamiyya). In the West, Ibn Hazm (q.v.) fiercely opposed\r\nthe system, but Ghazali established its orthodoxy in the East, and it\r\nspread from Persia to Syria and Egypt under the Ayyubites and Mamelukes\r\nand thence to the Almohades in Africa under Ibn Tumart (1130). It\r\nremains the predominating influence to the present day, its only serious\r\nrival being the theological system of al-Mataridi, a Hanifite (d. 945),\r\nwhose creed as represented in that of an-Nasafi is still used largely by\r\nthe Turks. Since the 12th century no great theological movement has been\r\nmade in Islam. The quiet of religious life has twice been broken, once\r\nby Wahhabism (q.v.) in Arabia, once by Babism (q.v.) in Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECTS\r\n\r\nAccording to an early tradition Mahomet said that Islam would be divided\r\ninto seventy-three parties (sects),[4] of which seventy-two would perish\r\nand one would be saved. The orthodox Arabian writers on heretical sects\r\nof Islam feel compelled by this tradition to make up their number to\r\nseventy-two, and, as different writers adopt different divisions or are\r\nfamiliar with different parties, the names of sects amount to some\r\nhundreds. Each writer, however, adopts certain main classes under which\r\nhe attempts to group the others. Abu Muti` Makhul at the beginning of\r\nthe 10th century in his \"Refutation\" (MS. in Bodleian Library) has six\r\nsuch chief classes: Harurites (i.e. Kharijites), Rafidites (i.e.\r\nShi`ites), Qadarites, Jabarites, Jahmites and Murjiites. Ibn Hazm (q.v.)\r\nadopts four classes: Mu`tazilites (Motazilites), Murjiites, Shi`ites and\r\nKharijites. Shahrastani (q.v.) complains of the want of system in\r\nearlier writers, and suggests as bases of classification the position of\r\nparties with regard to the doctrines as to (1) the divine attributes,\r\n(2) predestination and free-will (3) promises and threats, faith and\r\nerror, (4) revelation, reason, the imamate. In one part of his preface\r\nhe gives as the chief parties the Qadarites, Sifatites, Kharijites and\r\nShi`ites, proposing to divide these classes according to leaders who\r\nagreed with the main doctrines of their class but differed in some\r\npoints. In another place he mentions four opposite pairs of sects: (1)\r\nthe Qadarites with their doctrine of free-will, and the Jabarites, who\r\nare necessitarians; (2) the Sifatites, who maintain the eternal nature\r\nof the attributes of God, and the Mu`tazilites, who deny it; (3) the\r\nMurjiites, who postpone judgment of actions until the Last Day, and the\r\nWa`idites, who condemn in this life; (4) the Kharijites, who consider\r\nthe caliphate a human institution, and the Shi`ites, who deify their\r\nruler. In his detailed treatment of the sects Shahrastani arranged them\r\nunder the headings: Mu`tazilites, Jabarites, Sifatites, Kharijites,\r\nMurjiites and Shi`ites. About the same time as Shahrastani two other\r\nArabian writers wrote on the sects--Tahir ul-Isfaraini (d. 1078), whose\r\nMS. is in the Berlin library, and `Abd ul-Qadir ul-Jilani (1078-1166) in\r\nhis _Kitab ul-Ghaniyya li-Talibi Tariq il-Haqqi_ (Cairo, 1871). Both\r\nadopt as main classes Rafidites (or Shi`ites), Qadarites (or\r\nMu`tazilites), Kharijites, Murjiites, Najjarites, Dirarites, Jahmites,\r\nMushabbiha, to which Tahir adds Bakrites, Karramites, and a class\r\nincluding those sects which are not reckoned as Moslem though they have\r\nsprung from Islam. Jilani adds to the eight the Kilabites.\r\n\r\nThe following list is not a complete list of names of sects but is\r\nfounded on that of Shahrastani.[5]\r\n\r\n  _Aftahites._--Shi`ites of the Imamite class, who ascribe the imamate\r\n  to `Abdallah ul-Aftahi, the son of Sadiq.\r\n\r\n  _Ajarida._--Kharijites, followers of Ibn `Ajarrad, who agreed for the\r\n  most part with the Najadat (below), considered grave sins as\r\n  equivalent to unbelief, but remained friendly with those who professed\r\n  Islam but did not fight for it. They rejected _sura_ 7 as a fable.\r\n  Shahrastani enumerates seven divisions of this sect.\r\n\r\n  _Akhnasites._--A section of the Tha`aliba not so strict in treatment\r\n  of those who fear to fight for Islam.\r\n\r\n  _Ash`arites._--Followers of Ash`ari (q.v.) who are counted by\r\n  Shahrastani among the Sifatites.\r\n\r\n  _Atrafites._--A division of the `Ajarida who agree with the Hamzites\r\n  except that they excuse the lower classes for inaction when they are\r\n  ignorant of the law.\r\n\r\n  _Azraqites._--Kharijites who followed al-Azraq in the days of Ibn\r\n  Zubair. They held `Ali to be an unbeliever; those who did not fight\r\n  were unbelievers; the children of unbelievers were to be put to death\r\n  and went to hell. Sin is unbelief.\r\n\r\n  _Bahshamites._--Mu`tazilites akin to the Jubba`ites.\r\n\r\n  _Baihasites._--Kharijites, followers of Abu Baihas ul-Haitham, who was\r\n  put to death by the caliph Walid. They asserted the necessity of\r\n  knowledge for religion.\r\n\r\n  _Baqirites._--Shi`ites who followed Abu Ja`far ul-Baqir, the fifth\r\n  imam, and looked for his return.\r\n\r\n  _Batinites._--Isma`ilites, so called because they believe that every\r\n  external has an internal (_batin_), and every passage in the Koran has\r\n  an allegoric meaning.\r\n\r\n  _Bishrites._--Mu`tazilites, followers of Bishr ibn Mu`tamir, one of\r\n  the most learned men of his party. His teaching was philosophical and\r\n  was distinguished by his doctrine of \"origination\" (_tawallud_).\r\n\r\n  _Bunanites._--Kaisanites, followers of Bunan ibn Sim`an un-Nahdi, who\r\n  claimed that the imamate passed from Abu Hashim to himself and that he\r\n  had also acquired the divine element of `Ali.\r\n\r\n  _Butrites._--Zaidites, followers of Kathir un-Nawa ul-Abtar, who\r\n  agreed with the Suleimanites (Sulaimanites) except that he suspended\r\n  judgment as to whether Othman was a believer or not.\r\n\r\n  _Dirarites._--Jabarites who empty God of his attributes, and assert\r\n  that man has a sixth sense by which he will see God on the day of\r\n  resurrection. The actions of man are \"created\" and acquired by him. A\r\n  caliph need not be chosen from the Koreish.\r\n\r\n  _Ghaliites_ (Ghula) are the extreme Shi`ites (q.v.) in ascribing deity\r\n  to the imams. Their heresies are said to be four in number: (1) Making\r\n  God resemble man, (2) ascribing change of mind to God, (3) looking for\r\n  the return of the imam, (4) metempsychosis. They are divided by\r\n  Shahrastani into ten classes.\r\n\r\n  _Ghassanites._--Murjiites, followers of Ghassan ibn ul-Kufi, who say\r\n  that faith consists of knowledge of God, his apostle, and the Koran in\r\n  general not in detail, and that faith increases but is not diminished.\r\n\r\n  _Habities_ = Hayitites (below).\r\n\r\n  _Hadathites_ (Hudabites) are Mu`tazilites, followers of Fadl ibn\r\n  ul-Hadathi, who agreed with the Hayitites (below).\r\n\r\n  _Hafsites._--Ibadites, followers of Hafs ibn abi-l-Miqdam, who\r\n  distinguished between idolatry (_shirk_) and unbelief (_kufr_).\r\n\r\n  _Hamzites._--`Ajarida, followers of Hamza ibn Adrak in Sijistan. They\r\n  agree with the Maimunites, but condemn the children of unbelievers to\r\n  hell.\r\n\r\n  _Harithites._--Ibadites who differ from others in holding the\r\n  Mu`tazilite doctrine of free-will.\r\n\r\n  _Harurites._--A name given to the first Kharijites, who rebelled\r\n  against `Ali, and met in Harura near Kufa.\r\n\r\n  _Hashimites._--Shi`ites who supported Abu Hashim, son of Mahommed ibn\r\n  ul-Hanafiyya, although they held that his father had gone astray.\r\n\r\n  _Hashwiites._--A party who asserted the eternity even of the letters\r\n  of the Koran. They are not mentioned as a separate sect by\r\n  Shahrastani; cf. van Vloten, \"_Les Hachwia et Nabita_,\" in the _Acts\r\n  of the 11th Oriental Congress_ (Paris, 1899), pt. iii., pp. 99 sqq.\r\n\r\n  _Hayitites._--Mu`tazilites who agreed with the Nazzamites, but added\r\n  three heresies of their own: (1) the divinity of the Messiah, (2)\r\n  metempsychosis, (3) the interpretation of all references to the vision\r\n  of God as referring to the \"first Reason\" or \"creative Reason.\"\r\n\r\n  _Hishamites._--A name given to two sects: (1) Mu`tazilites, strong in\r\n  their assertion of man's free-will, even opposing the statement of the\r\n  Koran. (2) Shi`ites of the extreme kind, who attributed to God a body\r\n  with quantities (measurements) and qualities.\r\n\r\n  _Hudabites._--See Hadathites.\r\n\r\n  _Hudhailites_ (Hodhailites).--Mu`tazilites, followers of Abu-l Hudhail\r\n  Hamdan, who was a leading teacher of his party and developed the\r\n  philosophical side of its teaching. Ten of his main doctrines are\r\n  given by Shahrastani.\r\n\r\n  _Ibadites._--Kharijites of moderate tendencies (see above).\r\n\r\n  _Ilbaites._--Ghaliites who put `Ali above Mahomet and blamed the\r\n  latter because he called men to himself instead of to `Ali.\r\n\r\n  _Imamites._--One of the chief divisions of the Shi`ites (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  _Ishaqites._--Ghaliites agreeing with the Nusairites except that they\r\n  incline to speak of the imams' participation in the prophetic office\r\n  rather than of their divinity.\r\n\r\n  _Isma`ilites._--This name is applied to all who consider Isma`il ibn\r\n  Ja`far the last imam, some believing that he did not die but will\r\n  return, others, that at his death his son Mahommed became imam (see\r\n  ASSASSINS); it is also used as equivalent to the Batinites.\r\n\r\n  _Ithna`asharites._--Imamites who accept the twelve imams (see\r\n  SHI`ITES).\r\n\r\n  _Jabarites._--Those who deny all actions and power to act to man and\r\n  ascribe all to God (see above).\r\n\r\n  _Ja`farites._--Imamites who carry the imamate no farther than Ja`far\r\n  us-Sadiq.\r\n\r\n  _Jahizites._--Mu`tazilites, followers of the celebrated writer Jahiz\r\n  (q.v.), who indulged in philosophical speculations, believed in the\r\n  eternity of matter, and was regarded as a naturalist (_taba`i_) rather\r\n  than a theist (_allahi_).\r\n\r\n  _Jahmites._--Jabarites, followers of Jahm ibn Safwan, who was put to\r\n  death at Merv toward the close of the Omayyad period. He was extreme\r\n  in his denial of the attributes of God.\r\n\r\n  _Jarudites._--Zaidites who held that Mahomet designated `Ali as imam,\r\n  not by name but by his attributes, and that the Moslem sinned by not\r\n  taking sufficient trouble to recognize these attributes.\r\n\r\n  _Jubba`ites._--Mu`tazilites who followed the philosophical teaching of\r\n  Abu `Ali Mahommed ul-Jubba`i of Basra.\r\n\r\n  _Kaisanites._--A main class of the Shi`ites (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  _Kamilites._--Ghaliites, followers of Abu Kamil, who condemned the\r\n  companions (_Ansar_) because they did not do allegiance to `Ali, and\r\n  `Ali because he surrendered his claims.\r\n\r\n  _Karramites._--Sifatites, followers of Ibn Karram, who went so far as\r\n  to ascribe a body to God, and assimilated his nature to human nature.\r\n\r\n  _Kayyalites._--Ghaliites, followers of Ahmad ibn Kayyal, who, after\r\n  supporting a propaganda for an Aliite, claimed to be the imam himself\r\n  on the ground of his power over the spheres.\r\n\r\n  _Khalafites._--`Ajarida of Kerman and Multan, who believed that God\r\n  wills good and evil, but condemned the children of unbelievers to\r\n  hell.\r\n\r\n  _Kharijites._--One of the earliest sects of Islam (see above).\r\n\r\n  _Kharimites._--`Ajarida, agreeing mostly with the Shu`aibites and\r\n  teaching that the relation of God to a man depends on what he\r\n  professes at the end of his life.\r\n\r\n  _Khattabites._--Ghaliites, followers of Abu-l Khattab, who was put to\r\n  death by Ibn Musa at Kufa. He was a violent supporter of Ja`far\r\n  us-Sadiq, who however disowned him.\r\n\r\n  _Khayyatites._--Mu`tazilites, followers of Abu-l Hosain ul-Khayyat, a\r\n  teacher in Bagdad, part of whose philosophical teaching was that the\r\n  non-existent is a thing.\r\n\r\n  _Ma`badites._--Tha`labites who differed from the Akhnasites on the\r\n  question of the marriage of believing women and from Tha`lab on the\r\n  question of taking alms from slaves.\r\n\r\n  _Maimunites._--`Ajarida, followers of Maimun ibn Khalid, who believed\r\n  that God wills good only and that man determines his actions.\r\n\r\n  _Majhulites._--Tha`labites, agreeing generally with the Kharimites,\r\n  but teaching that he who knows some names and attributes of God and is\r\n  ignorant of some knows God.\r\n\r\n  _Ma`lumites._--Tha`labites agreeing generally with the Kharimites but\r\n  alleging that a believer must know all the names and attributes of\r\n  God.\r\n\r\n  _Mansurites._--Ghaliites, followers of Abu Mansur ul-`Ijli, who at\r\n  first supported al-Baqir, but, rejected by him, claimed the imamate\r\n  for himself. He was crucified by the caliph Hisham ibn `Abd ul-Malik\r\n  (Abdalmalik).\r\n\r\n  _Mu`ammarites._[6]--Mu`tazilites who strongly denied the\r\n  predestination of God, and affirmed that God created bodies only, and\r\n  that the accidents spring naturally from them.\r\n\r\n  _Mufaddalites._[6]--The same as the Musaites (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  _Mughirites._[6]--Ghaliites, followers of Mughira ibn Sa`id ul-`Ijli,\r\n  who claimed the imamate and prophetic office and held extremely gross\r\n  views of God.\r\n\r\n  _Muhakkima_[6] (the first).--Another name for the Harurites (above).\r\n\r\n  _Mukarramites._[6]--Tha`labites who taught that sin consists in\r\n  ignorance of God.\r\n\r\n  _Mukhtarites._[6]--Kaisanites, followers of al-Mukhtar ibn `Ubaid, who\r\n  held to Mahommed ibn ul-Hanafiyya but was disowned by him.

Bishrites) whose teaching he developed further. He taught\r\n  that God has power to do evil, but, if he acted thus, would be an evil\r\n  God; also that man can produce the equal of the Koran.\r\n\r\n  _Najadat_ (also known as _`Adhirites_).--Kharijites, who followed\r\n  Najda ibn `Amir of Yemama as he went to join the Azraqites but\r\n  withdrew from these, being more orthodox than they.

His classical education was chiefly obtained at a Jesuit college\r\nat Amiens, and after studying in Paris he entered the Jesuit college at\r\nRome and was admitted into the Society of Jesus. He served in\r\nSwitzerland and at Clongoweswood, Ireland, where he was prefect of\r\nstudies and subsequently master of rhetoric. Here he was involved in\r\nscandals that led to his resignation. On going to Italy he was told at\r\nFlorence that he was expelled from the Society. He succeeded, however,\r\nin obtaining priest's orders at Rome in 1832, and returned to Ireland,\r\nbut subsequently went to London, officiating for some time in the chapel\r\nof the Bavarian Legation. While there he fell in with William Maginn,\r\nand about 1834 began to contribute his celebrated \"Prout Papers\" to\r\n_Fraser's Magazine_. These consist of episodes in the life of the parish\r\npriest \"Father Prout,\" and dialogues after the model of \"Christopher\r\nNorth,\" varied by translations of well-known English songs into Latin,\r\nGreek, French and Italian verse, which he humorously represents as being\r\nthe true originals from which the English authors had merely plagiarized\r\nthem. Mahony's translations have been universally admired for the\r\nextraordinary command which they display of the various languages into\r\nwhich his renderings are made, and for their spirit and freedom both of\r\nthought and expression. His original verse tends chiefly to show that\r\nwith all his sarcastic and cynical wit his genius had also its tender,\r\nserious and sentimental side. His \"Bells of Shandon\" has always been\r\ngreatly admired. In 1846 Mahony became correspondent at Rome to the\r\n_Daily News_, and his letters from that capital gave very vivid pictures\r\nof the first years of the reign of Pius IX. The last twelve or fifteen\r\nyears of his life were spent in Paris, whence he supplied the _Globe_\r\nwith a series of piquant letters on the incidents of the day. He died in\r\nParis on the 18th of May 1866.\r\n\r\n  The _Reliques of Father Prout_ were collected from _Fraser's Magazine_\r\n  and published in two volumes in 1836; _The Final Reliques of Father\r\n  Prout_, chiefly extracted from the _Daily News_ and the _Globe_, were\r\n  edited by Blanchard Jerrold in 1876, and an edition of his works,\r\n  edited by Charles Kent, was published in 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHOUT (Hind. _mahawat_), an elephant-driver. The mahout sits on the\r\nelephant's neck and directs him by voice and by the use of a goad called\r\n_ankus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHRATTAS, a people of India, inhabiting the district known by the\r\nancient name of Maharashtra (Sans. \"great kingdom or region\"). This\r\nlarge tract, extending from the Arabian Sea on the west to the Satpura\r\nmountains in the north, comprises a good part of western and central\r\nIndia, including the modern provinces of the Konkan, Khandesh, Berar,\r\nthe British Deccan, part of Nagpur, and about half the nizam's Deccan.\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the word Mahratta (_Maratha_) is uncertain. The name\r\ndoes not indicate a social caste, or a religious sect; it is not even\r\ntribal. Strictly, it is confined to the upper class from whom Sivaji's\r\ngenerals were mostly drawn, and who sometimes claim a Rajput origin. In\r\na wider sense it may be extended to include all who inhabit Maharashtra\r\nand speak Mahratti as their mother-tongue. In 1901 the total number of\r\nspeakers of Mahratti in all India exceeded 18 millions.\r\n\r\nThe Mahrattas have always been a separate nation or people, and still\r\nregard themselves as such, though nowadays they are almost all under\r\nBritish or Mahommedan jurisdiction; that is, they belong either to\r\nBritish India or to the nizam's dominions. There are indeed still three\r\nlarge native states nominally Mahratta: that of Sindhia near the borders\r\nof Hindustan in the north, that of Holkar in Malwa in the heart of the\r\nIndian continent, and that of the gaekwar in Gujarat on the western\r\ncoast. But in these states the prince, his relatives and some of his\r\nministers or officials only are Mahrattas; the mass of the people belong\r\nto other sections of the Hindu race. These states then are not to be\r\nincluded in the Mahratta nation, though they have a share in Mahratta\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n  In general terms the Mahrattas, in the wider sense, may be described\r\n  under two main heads: first the Brahmans, and secondly the low-caste\r\n  men. The Mahratta Brahmans possess, in an intense degree, the\r\n  qualities of that famous caste, physical, intellectual and moral. They\r\n  have generally the lofty brow, the regular features, the spare upright\r\n  figure, and the calm aspect which might be expected in a race\r\n  maintained in great purity yet upon a broad basis. In modern times\r\n  they have proved themselves the most able and ambitious of all the\r\n  Brahmans in the Indian Empire. They are notably divided into two\r\n  sections: the Konkanast, coming from the Konkan or littoral tract on\r\n  the west coast below the Western Ghat mountains; and the Deshast,\r\n  coming from the uplands or Deccan, on the east of the mountains.\r\n  Though there have been many distinguished Deshasts, yet the most\r\n  remarkable of all have been Konkanasts. For instance, the peshwas, or\r\n  heads of the Mahratta confederation which at one time dominated nearly\r\n  all India, were Konkanast Brahmans. The birthplaces of these persons\r\n  are still known, and to this day there are sequestered villages,\r\n  nestling near the western base of the Ghats, which are pointed to as\r\n  being the ancestral homes of men who two centuries ago had political\r\n  control over half India.\r\n\r\n  Apart from the Brahmans, the Mahrattas may be generally designated as\r\n  Sudras, the humblest of the four great castes into which the Hindu\r\n  race is theoretically divided. But the upper classes claim to be\r\n  Kshattriyas or Rajputs. They probably are aborigines fundamentally,\r\n  with a mixture of what are now called the Scythian tribes, which at a\r\n  very early time overran India. The ordinary Mahrattas, who form the\r\n  backbone of the nation, have plain features, an uncouth manner, short\r\n  stature, a small but wiry frame. Though not powerful physically as\r\n  compared with the northern races of the Punjab and Oudh, they have\r\n  much activity and an unsurpassed endurance. Born and bred in or near\r\n  the Western Ghat mountains and the numerous tributary ranges, they\r\n  have all the qualities of mountaineers. In recent times they enter\r\n  military service less and less, betaking themselves mainly to\r\n  cultivation and to the carrying business connected with agriculture.\r\n  As husbandmen they are not remarkable; but as graziers, as cartmen, as\r\n  labourers, they are excellent. As artisans they have seldom signalized\r\n  themselves, save as armourers and clothweavers.\r\n\r\n  In the Konkan there are some superior proprietors termed Khots. With\r\n  this and perhaps some other exceptions, there are not in the Mahratta\r\n  country many large landlords, nor many of the superior tenure-holders\r\n  whose position relatively to that of the peasantry has caused much\r\n  discussion in other parts of India. There are indeed many Mahratta\r\n  chiefs still resident in the country, members of the aristocracy which\r\n  formerly enjoyed much wealth and power. They are sometimes in the\r\n  position of landlords, but often they are the assignees of the land\r\n  revenue, which they are entitled under special grants to collect for\r\n  themselves instead of for government, paying merely a small sum to\r\n  Government by way of quit-rent. Under them the cultivators are by\r\n  British arrangements placed in the position of peasant proprietors.\r\n  The village community has always existed as the social unit in the\r\n  Mahratta territories, though with less cohesion among its members than\r\n  in the village communities of Hindustan and the Punjab. The ancient\r\n  offices pertaining to the village, as those of the headmen (_patel_),\r\n  the village accountant, &c., are in working order throughout the\r\n  Mahratta country.\r\n\r\n  The Mahratta peasantry possess manly fortitude under suffering and\r\n  misfortune. Though patient and good-tempered in the main, they have a\r\n  latent warmth of temper, and if oppressed beyond a certain limit they\r\n  would fiercely turn upon their tormentors. As a rule they are orderly\r\n  and law-abiding, but traditions of plunder have been handed down to\r\n  them from early times, and many of them retain the predatory instincts\r\n  of their forefathers. The neighbourhood of dense forests, steep\r\n  hill-sides, and fastnesses hard of access offers extraordinary\r\n  facilities to plunderers for screening themselves and their booty.\r\n  Thus gang robbery is apt to break out, gains head with rapidity, and\r\n  is suppressed with difficulty. In times of peace it is kept under, but\r\n  during war, or whenever the bands of civil order are loosened, it\r\n  becomes a cause of anxiety and a source of danger. The women have\r\n  frankness and strength of character; they work hard in the fields, and\r\n  as a rule evince domestic virtue.\r\n\r\n  The peasantry preserve a grave and quiet demeanour, but they have\r\n  their humble ideas of gaiety, and hold their gatherings on occasions\r\n  of births or marriages. They frequently beguile their toil with\r\n  carols. They like the gossiping and bartering at the rural markets and\r\n  in the larger fairs, which are sometimes held in strikingly\r\n  picturesque localities. They are superstitious, and worship with\r\n  hearty veneration any being or thing whose destructive agency they\r\n  fear. They even speak of the tiger with honorific titles. They are\r\n  Hindus, but their Hinduism is held to be of a non-Aryan type. They are\r\n  sincerely devout in religion, and feel an awe regarding \"the holy\r\n  Brahmans,\" holding the life and the person of a Brahman sacred, even\r\n  though he be a criminal of the deepest dye. They of course regard the\r\n  cow as equally sacred. There are two principal sects among modern\r\n  Hindus--those who follow Vishnu, and those who follow Siva. The\r\n  Mahrattas generally follow Siva and his wife, a dread goddess known\r\n  under many names. The Mahratta war-cry, \"Har, Har, Mahadeo,\" referred\r\n  to Siva. All classes high and low are fond of the religious festivals,\r\n  the principal of which, the Dasahra, occurs in October, when the first\r\n  harvest of the year has been secured and the second crops sown. This\r\n  has always been held with the utmost pomp and magnificence at every\r\n  centre of Mahratta wealth and power. The people frequently assemble in\r\n  bowers and arbours constructed of leafy boughs to hear kathas recited.\r\n  These recitations are partly religious, partly also romantic and\r\n  quasi-historical. After them national resolves of just resistance or\r\n  of aggressive ambition have often been formed.\r\n\r\n  Apart from the Mahratta Brahmans, as already mentioned, the Mahratta\r\n  nobles and princes are not generally fine-looking men. There is\r\n  general truth in what was once said by a high authority to the effect\r\n  that, while there will be something dignified in the humblest Rajput,\r\n  there will be something mean in the highest Mahratta. Bluff\r\n  good-nature, a certain jocoseness, a humour pungent and ready, though\r\n  somewhat coarse, a hot or even violent disposition, are\r\n  characteristics of Mahratta chieftains. They usually show little\r\n  aptitude for business or for sedentary pursuits; but, on the other\r\n  hand, they are born equestrians and sportsmen. Mahratta ladies and\r\n  princesses have often taken a prominent part, for good or evil, in\r\n  public affairs and dynastic intrigues.\r\n\r\n  Though they have produced some poetry, the Mahrattas have never done\r\n  much for literature. Nor have they been distinguished in industrial\r\n  art. Their architecture in wood, however, was excellent; and the teak\r\n  forests of their country afforded the finest timber for building and\r\n  for carving. They had also much skill in the construction of works for\r\n  the supply of drinking water on a large scale and for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe range of the Western Ghats enabled the Mahrattas to rise against\r\ntheir Mahommedan conquerors, to reassert their Hindu nationality against\r\nthe whole power of the Mogul Empire, and to establish in its place an\r\nempire of their own. It is often stated that in India British conquest\r\nor annexation succeeded Mahommedan rule; and to a considerable extent\r\nthis was the case. But, on the other hand, the principal power, the\r\nwidest sovereignty, which the British overthrew in India was that of the\r\nMahrattas.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier Moslem invasions in 1100 and in subsequent years, the\r\nMahrattas do not seem to have made much resistance. They submitted to\r\nseveral Mahommedan kings under the changing circumstances of those\r\ntimes. It was against the Mahommedan king of Bijapur in the Deccan that\r\nSivaji, the hero of Mahratta history, first rebelled in 1657. Sivaji and\r\nhis fighting officers were Mahrattas of humble caste, but his ministers\r\nwere Brahmans. When the Mogul Empire absorbed the Bijapur kingdom he\r\ndefied the emperor. He imparted a self-reliant enthusiasm to his\r\ncountrymen, formed them into an army, and organized them as a political\r\ncommunity; his mountaineer infantry, though limited in numbers, proved\r\ndesperately courageous; his cavalry was daring and ubiquitous. The\r\nMoslems, having once overcome the Hindus in almost all parts of India,\r\nhad not for centuries met with any noteworthy uprising. Sivaji, however,\r\nplanned their expulsion, and before the end of his restless life made\r\nmuch progress in the execution of that design. The new state which he\r\nfounded was maintained under various vicissitudes after his death.\r\nMahratta resistance, once aroused by him, was never extinguished, and\r\nthe imperial resources were worn out by ceaseless though vain efforts to\r\nquell it. The great Mogul emperor's impoverished and enfeebled successor\r\nwas fain to recognize the Mahratta state by a formal instrument. The\r\nMahratta king, a descendant of Sivaji, had become a _roi fainéant_, and\r\nthe arrangement was negotiated by his Brahman minister, whose official\r\ndesignation was the peshwa. The office of peshwa then became hereditary\r\nin the minister's family, and grew in importance as the Mahratta kingdom\r\nrose, while the king sunk into the condition of a puppet. Thus the\r\nMahratta power was consolidated throughout nearly the whole of\r\nMaharashtra under the Brahman peshwa as virtual sovereign, with his\r\ncapital at Poona, while the titular Mahratta raja or king had his court\r\nat the neighbouring city of Satara. Despite his political importance,\r\nhowever, the raja was still venerated as the descendant of Sivaji.\r\n\r\nThen several chiefs carved out principalities of their own from among\r\nthe ruins of the Mogul Empire. Thus Raghoji Bhonsla established himself\r\nin the tracts lying underneath the southern base of the Satpura range\r\n(namely, Nagpur and Berar), overran Orissa and entered Bengal. Damaji\r\nGaekwar descended from the Western Ghats upon the alluvial plains of\r\nGujarat around Baroda; Tukoji Holkar subdued the uplands of Malwa beyond\r\nthe Vindhya range on the north bank of the Nerbudda; and Mahadji Sindhia\r\nobtained possession of large tracts immediately south of Agra and Delhi,\r\nmarched into Hindustan and became virtually the master of the Mogul\r\nemperor himself (see GWALIOR). Sivaji's own father had founded a\r\ndominion at Tanjore in the extreme south, which, however, never had\r\nrelations with the central power at Poona. The same may be said of the\r\nstate of Kolhapur, allotted to a younger branch of Sivaji's family.\r\n\r\nBut these principalities, though independent respecting internal\r\nadministration, and making war or peace with their neighbours according\r\nto opportunity, owned allegiance to the peshwa at Poona as the head of\r\nthe Mahratta race. On state occasions heads of principalities would\r\nvisit Poona by way of acknowledging the superior position of the peshwa.\r\nOn the other hand, the peshwa was careful to obtain the sanction of his\r\nnominal sovereign at Satara to every important act of state. Thus a\r\nconfederation was formed of which the Brahman peshwa or head was at\r\nPoona, governing the adjacent territories, while the members, belonging\r\nto the lower castes, were scattered throughout the continent of India.\r\nSuch was the Mahratta Empire which supplanted the Mogul Empire. The\r\nMahratta power grew and prospered till it embraced all western and most\r\nof central India. Its culminating point was reached about 1750, or about\r\na century after Sivaji first rebelled against his Mahommedan sovereign.\r\n\r\nIts armies drew soldiers from all parts of India. The infantry was not\r\nof good quality; but its cavalry was really an enormous force, numbering\r\nfully a hundred thousand in all. The horsemen were splendidly audacious\r\nin riding for long distances into the heart of a hostile country,\r\nwithout support, striking some terrific blows, and then returning\r\nrapidly beyond reach of pursuit. They could truly boast of having\r\nwatered their horses in every Indian river from the Cauvery to the\r\nIndus. If attacked, however, in a competent manner, they would not\r\nstand; and afterwards, in conflict with the British, whole masses of\r\nthem behaved in a dastardly manner. As their ambition grew the chiefs\r\nbegan to organize their troops after the system learnt from the English\r\nand French. In this way several Frenchmen--Benoit de Boigne, Perron and\r\nothers--rose in the Mahratta service to a position dangerous to the\r\nBritish. But the new system was unsuited to the Mahratta genius; it\r\nhampered the meteoric movements of the cavalry, which was obliged to\r\nmanoeuvre in combination with the new artillery and the disciplined\r\nbattalions. Mahratta elders hence uttered predictions of military\r\ndisaster which were in the end more than fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe rapid and amazing success of the Mahratta confederation rendered it\r\nthe largest Hindu power that ever existed in India. But it lacked the\r\nelements of true greatness. It was founded by plundering expeditions,\r\nand its subsequent existence was tainted by the baseness of this\r\npredatory origin. With the exception of the peshwas, its chiefs were\r\nlittle more than free-booting warriors, for the most part rude, violent\r\nand unlettered. Their custom was to offer their neighbours or victims\r\nthe alternative of paying _chouth_, that is, one-fourth of the revenue,\r\nor being plundered and ravaged. Thus the Mahratta _chouth_ came to have\r\nan ominous significance in Indian history. Desultory efforts were made\r\nto establish a civil government, but in the main there was no\r\nadministration formed on statesmanlike principles. The peshwas, on the\r\nother hand, as Brahmans, were men of the highest education then possible\r\nin India. But they were absorbed by the direction of military and\r\npolitical combinations, and by intrigues for the preservation of their\r\nown power; and, even allowing for all this, they failed to evince the\r\ncivil capacity which might have been anticipated. While several\r\ndisplayed commanding abilities, and some possessed many virtues, one\r\nalone attempted to conduct an administration in an enlightened manner,\r\nand he died prematurely.\r\n\r\nThere were at the same time powers existing in India to keep the\r\nMahrattas in check, and some parts of India were excepted from their\r\ndepredations. The English power was rising at Calcutta, Madras and\r\nBombay. The nascent Sikh power prevented Mahratta incursions from being\r\npermanently successful in the Punjab. As the Mogul Empire broke up, some\r\nseparate Mahommedan powers rose upon its ruins. The nizam of the Deccan\r\nestablished himself at Hyderabad, comparatively near the headquarters of\r\nthe peshwa. Hyder Ali was proclaimed sultan of Mysore in the south.\r\nAhmed Shah Abdali burst upon India from Afghanistan. The Mahrattas\r\nbravely encountered him at Panipat near Delhi in 1761, and were\r\ndecisively defeated. The defeat, however, did not essentially shake the\r\nMahratta confederation. It was collision with the English that broke\r\nthat wonderful fabric to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe first collision with the English occurred in 1775, arising from a\r\ndisputed succession to the peshwaship. The English government at Bombay\r\nsupported one of the claimants, and the affair became critical for the\r\nEnglish as well as for the Mahrattas. It was at this conjuncture that\r\nWarren Hastings displayed his political genius and rendered signal\r\nservice to his country, by succouring from Bengal the defeated Bombay\r\narmy and negotiating a peace (in 1782) that restored the _status quo_.\r\n\r\nThe next collision happened in 1803. The peshwa had fallen into grave\r\ndifficulties with some of the principal members of the Mahratta\r\nconfederation. He therefore placed himself under British protection, and\r\nthis led to the great Mahratta War, in which the Marquis Wellesley\r\ndisplayed those talents for military and political combination which\r\nrendered him illustrious. It was during the campaigns which ensued that\r\nGeneral Arthur Wellesley defeated Sindhia and the Bhonsla raja at\r\nAssaye, and General Lake won the victories of Farrukhabad, Dig and\r\nLaswari over Sindhia and Holkar. The three confederates, Sindhia, Holkar\r\nand the Bhonsla, concluded peace with the British government, after\r\nmaking large sacrifices of territory in favour of the victor, and\r\nsubmitting to British control politically. It was during these events\r\nthat the British won the province of Orissa, the old Hindustan\r\nafterwards part of the North-Western Provinces, and a part of the\r\nwestern coast in Gujarat.\r\n\r\nThe third collision came to pass between 1816 and 1818, through the\r\nconduct, not only of the confederates, but also of the peshwa (Baji Bao)\r\nhimself. During the previous war the peshwa had been the protégé and\r\nally of the British; and since the war he had fallen more completely\r\nthan before under British protection--British political officers and\r\nBritish troops being stationed at his capital. He apparently felt\r\nencouraged by circumstances to rebel. Holkar and the Bhonsla committed\r\nhostile acts. The predatory Pindaris offered a formidable resistance to\r\nthe British troops. So the peshwa ventured to take part in the\r\ncombination against the British power, which even yet the Mahrattas did\r\nnot despair of overthrowing. After long-protracted menaces, he attacked\r\nthe British at Kirkee, but failed utterly, and fled a ruined man.\r\nUltimately he surrendered to Sir John Malcolm, and was sent as a state\r\npensioner to Bithur, near Cawnpore. The British, however, released the\r\nraja of Satara from the captivity in which he had been kept during the\r\npeshwa's time, and reinstated him on the throne, with a limited\r\nterritory. Owing to these events the British government became possessed\r\nof the Konkan and of the greater part of the Deccan.\r\n\r\nIt remains to mention briefly the fortunes of each remaining member of\r\nthe once imperial confederation. The principality of Satara was held to\r\nhave lapsed in 1848 by the death of the raja without lineal heirs, and\r\nwas annexed by the British government. The Bhonsla raja of Nagpur died\r\nwithout lineal heirs in 1853, and his territory was likewise annexed.\r\nThe house of Holkar remained faithful to its engagements with the\r\nBritish government, and its position as a feudatory of the empire was\r\nmaintained. In Sindhia's territory, by reason of internal feuds, the\r\nBritish had to undertake measures which were successfully terminated\r\nafter the battles of Maharajpur and Panniar in 1843. But on the whole\r\nthe house of Sindhia remained faithful. Sindhia himself was actively\r\nloyal during the Mutiny. The gaekwar gradually fell under British\r\ncontrol towards the close of the 18th century, and his house never\r\nengaged in hostilities with the British government. The ex-peshwa lived\r\nto old age at Bithur, and died in 1857. His adopted son grew up to be\r\nthe Nana Sahib, of infamous memory, who took a leading part in the\r\nMutiny.\r\n\r\n  See J. Grant Duff, _History of the Mahrattas_ (3 vols., 1826); T. D.\r\n  Broughton, _Letters written in a Mahratta Camp_ (1813); M. G. Ranade,\r\n  _Rise of the Maratha Power_ (Bombay, 1900).     (R. T.; J. S. Co.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAHSEER, or MAHASEER (_Barbus mosal_), a kind of barbel, abundant in the\r\nrivers of India, especially in pools of the upper and more rapid streams\r\nwhere they issue from the mountainous part of the country. It is one of\r\nthe largest species of the Cyprinid family, attaining to a length of 3\r\nto 5 ft., and sometimes exceeding a weight of 70 lb. Its body is\r\nwell-proportioned, rather elongate, and somewhat like that of the\r\nEuropean barbel, but covered with very large scales, of which there are\r\nonly twenty-five or twenty-seven placed along the lateral line; the\r\ndorsal fin is armed with a long and strong spine, and the mouth provided\r\nwith four slender and short barbels. The lips are sometimes produced\r\ninto fleshy lobes. To the fisherman in India the mahseer affords the\r\nsame kind of sport as the salmon in the British Isles, and it rivals\r\nthat fish as regards size, strength and activity. Its flesh is likewise\r\nmuch esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAI, ANGELO (1782-1854), Italian cardinal and philologist, was born of\r\nhumble parents at Schilpario in the province of Bergamo, Lombardy, on\r\nthe 7th of March 1782. In 1799 he entered the Society of Jesus, and in\r\n1804 he became a teacher of classics in the college of Naples. After\r\ncompleting his studies at the Collegium Romanum, he lived for some time\r\nat Orvieto, where he was engaged in teaching and palaeographical\r\nstudies. The political events of 1808 necessitated his withdrawal from\r\nRome (to which he had meanwhile returned) to Milan, where in 1813 he was\r\nmade custodian of the Ambrosian library. He now threw himself with\r\ncharacteristic energy and zeal into the task of examining the numerous\r\nMSS. committed to his charge, and in the course of the next six years\r\nwas able to restore to the world a considerable number of long-lost\r\nworks. Having withdrawn from the Society of Jesus, he was invited to\r\nRome in 1819 as chief keeper of the Vatican library. In 1833 he was\r\ntransferred to the office of secretary of the congregation of the\r\nPropaganda; on the 12th of February 1838 he was raised to the dignity of\r\ncardinal. He died at Castelgandolfo, near Albano, on the 8th of\r\nSeptember 1854.\r\n\r\nIt is on his skill as a reader of palimpsests that Mai's fame chiefly\r\nrests. To the period of his residence at Milan belong: Fragments of\r\nCicero's _Pro Scauro, Pro Tullio, Pro Flacco, In Clodium et Curionem, De\r\naere alieno Milonis, De rege_ (_Alexandrino_ (1814); _M. Corn. Frontonis\r\nopera inedita, cum epistolis item ineditis, Antonini Pii, Marci Aurelii,\r\nLucii Veri et Appiani_ (1815; new ed., 1823, with more than 100\r\nadditional letters found in the Vatican library); portions of eight\r\nspeeches of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus; fragments of Plautus; the\r\noration of Isaeus _De hereditate Cleonymi_; the last nine books of the\r\n_Antiquities_ of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and a number of other\r\nworks. _M. Tullii Ciceronis de republica quae supersunt_ appeared at\r\nRome in 1822; _Scriptorum veterum nova collectio, e vaticanis codicibus\r\nedita_ in 1825-1838; _Classici scriptores e vaticanis codicibus editi_\r\nin 1828-1838; _Spicilegium romanum_ in 1839-1844; and _Patrum nova\r\nbibliotheca_ in 1845-1853. His edition of the celebrated _Codex\r\nvaticanus_, completed in 1838, but not published (ostensibly on the\r\nground of inaccuracies) till four years after his death (1858), is the\r\nleast satisfactory of his labours and was superseded by the edition of\r\nVercellone and Cozza (1868), which itself leaves much to be desired.\r\nAlthough Mai was not as successful in textual criticism as in the\r\ndecipherment of manuscripts, he will always be remembered as a laborious\r\nand persevering pioneer, by whose efforts many ancient writings have\r\nbeen rescued from oblivion.\r\n\r\n  See B. Prina, _Biografia del cardinale Angelo Mai_ (Bergamo, 1882), a\r\n  scientific work, which gives a full and, at the same time, a just\r\n  appreciation of his work; Cozza-Luzi, _Epistolario del card. Angelo\r\n  Mai_ (Bergamo, 1883); life by G. Poletto (Siena, 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIA, in Greek mythology, the eldest of the Pleiades, the seven\r\ndaughters of Atlas and the Oceanid Pleïone. She and her sisters, born on\r\nMt Cyllene in Arcadia, are sometimes called mountain goddesses. In a\r\ncave of Cyllene Maia became by Zeus the mother of the god Hermes. The\r\nstory is told in the _Hymn to Hermes_ attributed to Homer. She was\r\nidentified by the Romans with Maia Majesta, an old Italian goddess of\r\nspring, to whom a sacrifice was offered on the 1st of May by the priest\r\nof Vulcan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDA, a town of Calabria, Italy, in the province of Catanzaro, from\r\nwhich it is 30 m. W.S.W. direct, and 12 m. N.N.E. of Pizzo by rail (the\r\nstation is 8 m. W. of the town). Pop. (1901), 5190. The town gives its\r\nname to the plain of Maida, where in 1806 British troops under Sir John\r\nStuart defeated the French under Regnier. The names Maida Hill and Maida\r\nVale in London are derived from this battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDAN, an Indian term for any open plain. The Maidan is the name of the\r\npark in Calcutta, surrounding Fort William, where society people drive\r\nin the afternoon. The name is also applied to one of the valleys in the\r\nAfridi country of Tirah, and to the plateau portion of the state of\r\nMysore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDEN, or MAID, a young unmarried girl. \"Maid\" is a shortened form of\r\n\"maiden,\" O. Eng. _maegden_, which represents a diminutive of a Teutonic\r\nword meaning \"young person,\" of either sex. An old English word \"may,\"\r\nmeaning a kinsman or kinswoman, and also a virgin or girl, represents\r\nthe original. In early usage \"maiden\" as meaning \"virgin\" is frequently\r\napplied to the male sex, thus, in Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, Sir\r\nPercyvale is called a \"parfyte clene megden.\" Apart from the direct\r\napplications of the word to the unmarried state, such as \"maiden name,\"\r\n\"maiden lady,\" &c., the word is used adjectivally, implying the\r\npreservation of the first state of an object, or indicating a first\r\neffort of any kind. Probably a \"maiden\" fortress is one which has never\r\nfallen, though the _New English Dictionary_ suggests that the various\r\n\"maiden castles\" in England, usually ancient earthworks, may have been\r\nso called from being so strong that they could be defended by maidens,\r\nand points out that Edinburgh Castle, called \"maiden-castle\" by William\r\nDrummond of Hawthornden (_Speech for Edinburgh to the King_), is styled\r\n_Castrum puellarum_, the \"castle of the maidens,\" in Geoffrey of\r\nMonmouth. A \"maiden\" assize, circuit or session is one at which there\r\nare no prisoners for trial; a \"maiden over\" or \"maiden\" in cricket is an\r\nover from which no runs are scored. A \"maiden speech\" is the first\r\nspeech made by a member of parliament in the house. In the _Annual\r\nRegister_ for 1794 (quoted in _N.E.D._) the expression, with reference\r\nto Canning's first speech, is said to be \"according to the technical\r\nlanguage of the house.\" \"Maiden\" is applied to several objects, to a\r\nmovable framework or horse for drying and airing of linen, to a\r\nwasherwoman's \"dolly\" or wooden beater, to the \"kirnbaby\" formed of the\r\nlast sheaf of corn reaped which formerly figured in the Scottish harvest\r\nhomes, and to the beheading instrument, known as the \"Scottish maiden\"\r\n(see below). \"Maid,\" apart from its primary sense of an unmarried woman,\r\nis chiefly used for a domestic female servant, usually with a qualifying\r\nword prefixed, such as \"housemaid,\" \"parlour-maid,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe title of \"MAID OF HONOUR\" is given to an unmarried lady attached to\r\nthe personal suite of a queen. The custom of sending young girls of\r\nnoble or good birth to the court of a prince or feudal superior, for the\r\npurpose, primarily, of education, goes back to early feudal times, and\r\nis parallel with the sending of boys to act as pages and squires to the\r\nfeudal castles. The regular establishment of maids of honour (_filles\r\nd'honneur_) appears first in the royal court of France. This has usually\r\nbeen attributed to Anne of Brittany, wife of Charles VIII.; she had a\r\ngroup of unmarried girls of high rank at her court as part of her\r\nhousehold, in whom she took a lively and parental interest, educating\r\nthem and bestowing a dowry upon them on their marriage. A slightly\r\nearlier instance, however, has been found. When the young Margaret of\r\nAustria came to France on her espousal to Charles VIII., broken by his\r\nmarriage to Anne of Brittany, there were in her train several _filles\r\nd'honneur_, whose names appear in the _Comptes d'argenterie de la reine\r\nMarguerite d'Autriche_, from 1484-1485 and 1488-1489 (_Archives de\r\nl'empire K. K. 80 and 81_ quoted by A. Jal, _Dictionnaire critique de\r\nbiographie et d'histoire_). It is from the days of Francis I. that the\r\n_chroniques scandaleuses_ begin which circle round the maids of honour\r\nof the French court. The maids of Catherine de Medici, celebrated as the\r\n\"flying squadron,\" _l'escadron volant_, are familiar from the pages of\r\nPierre de l'Estoile (1574-1611) and Brantôme. Among those whose beauty\r\nCatherine used in her political intrigues, the most famous were Isabelle\r\nde Limeuil, Mlle de Montmorency-Fosseux, known as _la belle Fosseuse_,\r\nand Charlotte de Baune. The _filles d'honneur_, as an institution, were\r\nsuppressed in the reign of Louis XIV., at the instigation of Mme de\r\nMontespan--who had been one of them--and their place was taken by the\r\n_dames de palais_. In the English court, this custom of attaching \"maids\r\nof honour\" to the queen's person was no doubt adopted from France. At\r\nthe present day a queen regnant has eight maids of honour, a queen\r\nconsort four. They take precedence next after the daughters of barons,\r\nand where they have not by right or courtesy a title of their own, they\r\nare styled \"Honourable.\"\r\n\r\n  THE SCOTTISH MAIDEN was an instrument of capital punishment formerly\r\n  in use in Scotland. It is said to have been invented by the earl of\r\n  Morton, who is also said to have been its first victim. This, however,\r\n  could not have been the case, as the maiden was first used at the\r\n  execution of the inferior agents in the assassination of Rizzio (1561)\r\n  and Morton was not beheaded till 1581. The maiden was practically an\r\n  early form of guillotine. A loaded blade or axe moving in grooves was\r\n  fixed in a frame about ten feet high. The axe was raised to the full\r\n  height of the frame and then released, severing the victim's head from\r\n  his body. At least 120, suffered death by the maiden, including the\r\n  regent Morton, Sir John Gordon of Haddo, President Spottiswood, the\r\n  marquis and earl of Argyll. In 1710 it ceased to be used; it is now\r\n  preserved in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, in\r\n  Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDENHAIR, in botany, the common name for a fern, _Adiantum\r\nCapillus-Veneris_, characterized by the spreading hairlike branches of\r\nthe frond, the ultimate pinnules of which are ½ to 1 in. long with a\r\nrounded crenate outer edge and repeatedly forked veins; the sori (or\r\nmasses of spore-capsules) are in the crenatures of the pinnules, and are\r\nprotected by a kidney-shaped involucre. The plant is widely distributed\r\nin temperate and tropical regions, and is occasionally found in the\r\nwestern counties of England, the Isle of Man, and west Ireland, growing\r\non damp rocks or walls especially near the sea. The genus _Adiantum_ is\r\na large one containing many handsome species both tropical and\r\ntemperate, well known in greenhouse and hothouse cultivation.\r\n\r\n  MAIDENHAIR-TREE is a popular name for _Ginkgo biloba_, a remarkable\r\n  and handsome gymnospermous tree, the fan-shaped leaves of which with\r\n  their forked veins recall those of the maidenhair (see GYMNOSPERMS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDENHEAD, a market town and municipal borough in the Wokingham\r\nparliamentary division of Berkshire, England; 24½ m. W. of London by the\r\nGreat Western railway. Pop. (1901), 12,980. Area, 2125 acres. It is\r\npleasantly situated on and above the west (right) bank of the Thames,\r\nand is much in favour as a residential town and a resort of boating\r\nparties. Though of high antiquity it is wholly modern in appearance, and\r\na large number of handsome houses have been built in its vicinity. A\r\nbeautiful timbered house of the 15th century, however, survives in\r\nOckwells, a short distance south of the town. The stone bridge carrying\r\nthe London road over the Thames dates from 1772; but the crossing is of\r\nancient importance. Maidenhead has trade in malt and grain. The borough\r\nis under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.\r\n\r\nThe history of Maidenhead (Maydenhutt, Maydenhith) is bound up with that\r\nof the ancient bridge. It is not mentioned in Domesday. Edward I. (1297)\r\ngave a grant of pontage in aid of the bridge, which was almost broken\r\ndown; similar grants to the \"bailiffs and good men of Maydenhithe\" were\r\nmade by succeeding sovereigns. In 1451 Henry VI. incorporated the gild\r\nof the Brethren and Sisters of Maydenhith to provide certain necessaries\r\nfor the celebration of Mass and to keep the bridge in order: the gild,\r\ndissolved at the Reformation, was revived by Elizabeth, who, however,\r\nlater (1581) substituted for it a corporation consisting of a warden,\r\nbridgemaster, burgesses and commonalty: the governing charter until the\r\n19th century was that of James I. (1685) incorporating the town under\r\nthe title of the mayor, bridgemaster and burgesses. In 1400 Thomas\r\nHoland, earl of Kent, held the bridge in the interests of the deposed\r\nRichard II., but was eventually forced to retire. In 1643 a meeting took\r\nplace in the town between Charles I. and three of his children. In the\r\n18th century a considerable trade was done in carrying malt, meal and\r\ntimber in barges to London: at that time three fairs were held which\r\nhave now practically disappeared. The Wednesday market is held under a\r\ncharter of Elizabeth (1582).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAID MARIAN, a personage incorporated in the English legend of Robin\r\nHood. There is no evidence that she had originally any connexion with\r\nthe Robin Hood cycle. She seems to have been an essential feature of the\r\nmorris dance, and in the may-game was paired sometimes with Robin-Hood,\r\nbut oftener with Friar Tuck. The well-known pastoral play of Adam de la\r\nHale, _Jeu de Robin et Marion_, and the many French songs on the\r\nsubject, account for the association of the names. In the ballads on\r\nRobin Hood her name is twice casually mentioned, but there is a late\r\nballad, by a certain S. G. (F. J. Child, _English and Scottish Ballads_,\r\ni. 219), which tells how Maid Marian sought Robin in the forest\r\ndisguised as a page, and fought with him for an hour before she\r\nrecognized him by his voice. S. G. was perhaps acquainted with the two\r\nplays, written in 1598, of _The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of\r\nHuntingdon_, by Anthony Munday and Harry Chettle. In _The Downfall_\r\nMatilda Fitz Walter escapes from the persecution of King John by\r\nfollowing her lover to Sherwood Forest, where they took the names of\r\nRobin Hood and Maid Marian, and lived apart until they could be legally\r\nunited. Perhaps this tale has some connexion with the romance of the\r\noutlaw Fulk Fitz Warin. Matilda or Mahaud, widow of Theobald Walter,\r\nescaped from John's solicitations by marrying the outlawed Fulk and\r\nfollowing him to the forest. There were in semi-historical legends three\r\nMatildas pursued by King John, of whom particulars are given by H. L. D.\r\nWard in his _Catalogue of Romances_ (i. 502). Their several histories\r\nwere fused by the Elizabethan dramatists, and associated with the Maid\r\nMarian of the morris dance, who up to that time had probably only a\r\nvague connexion with Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDSTONE, a market town and municipal and parliamentary borough, and\r\nthe county town of Kent, England, 41 m. E.S.E. of London by the South\r\nEastern & Chatham railway. Pop. (1901), 33,516; area, 4008 acres. It\r\nlies principally on the eastern bank of the river Medway, the modern\r\npart spreading over the western slopes of a picturesque valley, which is\r\nintersected and environed by orchards and hop gardens, this being the\r\nrichest agricultural district of Kent. The hop grounds form the\r\nso-called middle growth of Kent, and the town has the principal grain\r\nmarket in the county. Archbishop Boniface in 1260 established a hospital\r\nhere (Newark hospital) for poor pilgrims, the chapel of which, with\r\nmodern additions, is now St Peter's Church. The parish church of St\r\nMary, which had existed from Norman times, was demolished in 1395 by\r\nArchbishop Courtenay, who erected on the site the present church of All\r\nSaints. This fine Perpendicular building contains, besides many\r\nexcellent monuments, the richly carved sedilia and the twenty-eight oak\r\nseats used by the collegiate priests. Courtenay also founded a college\r\nof secular canons, the ruins of which are an interesting specimen of\r\n14th-century architecture. From the reign of John until the Reformation\r\nthe archbishops had a residence here, at which Stafford and Courtenay\r\ndied. This Perpendicular building, with its Elizabethan east front, was\r\nacquired by the corporation as a memorial of Queen Victoria's Jubilee in\r\n1887, and houses the school of science and art. The rectory, with the\r\nmanor, passed into lay hands at the Reformation; and, having been a\r\nperpetual curacy for three hundred and twenty years, the living became a\r\nvicarage in 1866. The grammar school was founded in 1549, and endowed\r\nwith the estates of the local Corpus Christi fraternity, then dissolved;\r\nthe hall in which the gild assembled remains, but the school is\r\nestablished in modern buildings on a new site. There are oil-mills,\r\nrope, sacking and twine factories, and cement, lime, and brick works.\r\nThere is a considerable carrying trade on the Medway. A museum, with\r\npublic library, was opened in 1858, in an interesting building of the\r\nearly part of the 16th century. This is the headquarters of the Kent\r\nArchaeological Society, founded by the Rev. L. B. Larking in 1858. In\r\n1890 an art gallery was added. The West Kent and General hospital, the\r\ncounty ophthalmic hospital, county gaol and barracks may be mentioned\r\namong other institutions. From Saxon times down to 1830 condemned\r\nmalefactors were executed, and all the great county meetings were held,\r\non Penenden Heath, a common situated about a mile north-east of the\r\ntown, and enclosed by the corporation as a public recreation ground. The\r\nparliamentary borough of Maidstone returns one member. The town is\r\ngoverned by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of a Roman settlement at Maidstone. The name Maidstone\r\n(Medwegestun, Meddestane, Maydestan), probably meaning Medway Town, is\r\npresumably of Saxon origin. At the time of the Domesday Survey it\r\nbelonged to the archbishop of Canterbury, and from the reign of John the\r\narchbishops had a residence there. Its position in the centre of Kent\r\ngave it an early importance; the shire-moot was held on Penenden Heath\r\nin the 11th century, and Maidstone was an assize town in the reign of\r\nEdward I. In 1537 Cranmer exchanged the manor of Maidstone with the\r\nking, and it was granted by Edward VI. to Sir Thomas Wyatt. Edward also\r\nincorporated the town by the title of the mayor, jurats and commonalty;\r\nit had formerly been governed by a portreve and 12 \"brethren.\" This\r\ncharter was forfeited through Wyatt's rebellion; a second charter was\r\ngranted by Elizabeth in 1559 and confirmed by subsequent sovereigns. A\r\nnew charter constituting a governing body of a mayor, 12 jurats and 40\r\ncommon councilmen was given at the petition of the inhabitants by George\r\nII. in 1747, and remained the governing charter until 1835. Four fairs\r\nwere granted by the charter of 1559; these are now held on the 13th of\r\nFebruary, the 12th of May, the 20th of June and the 17th of October. A\r\nThursday market was granted by Henry III. to Archbishop Boniface, and a\r\nmarket every second Tuesday in the month by charter of George II. A corn\r\nmarket on Tuesday and a cattle market on Thursday are still held. The\r\nmanufacture of linen and woollen goods was introduced by Walloons, who\r\nsettled here in 1567. This was succeeded by paper-making, now the chief\r\nindustry of the town. The cultivation of hops has been carried on since\r\nthe 17th century.\r\n\r\nMaidstone has been associated with various incidents of general history.\r\nWat Tyler broke into the prison, liberated John Ball the rebel preacher,\r\nand committed various depredations. Several of the leading inhabitants\r\njoined Jack Cade's rising. The rising of the Kentish Royalists in 1648\r\ncollapsed at Maidstone, where on the 1st of June Fairfax, after five\r\nhours' obstinate fighting, captured the town at midnight.\r\n\r\n  See _Victoria County History, Kent_; I. M. Russell, _History of\r\n  Maidstone_ (1881).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIHAR, a native state of Central India, in the Baghelkhand agency.\r\nArea, 407 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 63,702; estimated revenue, £4700. The\r\nstate, which is watered by the Tons river, consists mainly of alluvial\r\nsoil covering sandstone, and is fertile except in the hilly district of\r\nthe south. A large area is under forest, the produce of which provides a\r\nsmall export trade. The chief, whose title is raja, claims descent from\r\nthe Kachwaha Rajput clan. The state suffered severely from famine in\r\n1896-1897. The town of Maihar (pop. 6802) is on the East Indian railway,\r\n97 m. N. of Jubbulpore. Extensive ruins of shrines and other buildings\r\nin its neighbourhood indicate a former much greater extent of the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIL. (1) (Through Fr. _maille_, from Lat. _macula_, a spot or hole, the\r\nmesh of a net), properly a metal ring or link which, joined closely with\r\nother links, formed the fabric of body and other armour in the middle\r\nages, till it was superseded by plate-armour. The word \"mail,\" properly\r\napplied to this form of chain-armour, is also used of armour generally,\r\nwhether plate or chain, and is also transferred to the horny defensive\r\ncoverings of animals, such as the tortoise, crab, &c. (see ARMS AND\r\nARMOUR). (2) (O. Eng. _mál_, speech; probably the same as O. Saxon\r\n_mahal_, assembly; in meaning connected with O. Norse _mále_,\r\nstipulation), a Scots law term meaning rent, tax. \"Mails and duties\" are\r\nthe rents, whether in kind or money, of an estate. In English the word\r\nonly survives in \"blackmail\" (q.v.). (3) (Through O. Fr. _male_, mod.\r\n_malle_, a Teutonic word surviving in Dutch _maal_), properly a bag,\r\nespecially one used in travelling; this word, which appears in Chaucer,\r\nis now applied chiefly to the despatch and delivery of postal matter. In\r\nthis sense \"mail\" is properly the bag in which such matter is conveyed,\r\nand hence is applied to the contents of the mail, postal matter\r\ncollectively, and to the train, carts, or other means used in the\r\ndespatch and delivery of the same. In general usage \"mail\" is confined\r\nto the \"foreign\" as opposed to the \"inland\" despatch of letters, &c.,\r\nand to which the word \"post\" is chiefly applied; in official language,\r\nthe word refers to the inland despatch. The word appears also in\r\n\"mail-coach,\" a coach used for conveying the mails, and in \"mail-cart,\"\r\na cart similarly employed. This word is also applied to a light low\r\nvehicle propelled or drawn by hand, suitable for young children. The\r\n\"mail phaeton\" is a type of phaeton with high seat for two persons and\r\ndrawn by a pair of horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAILLY, LOUISE JULIE, COMTESSE DE (1710-1751), mistress of Louis XV. of\r\nFrance, was the daughter of Louis, marquis de Nesle. She was the eldest\r\nof three sisters who succeeded one another as favourites of the king. In\r\n1726 she married her cousin, Louis Alexandre de Mailly. Although Louis\r\nXV. had paid her attentions from 1732, she did not become titular\r\nmistress until 1738. She did not use her position either to enrich\r\nherself or to interfere in politics. She was supplanted by her sister,\r\nthe duchess of Châteauroux, and obliged to leave court in 1742.\r\n\r\n  See E. and J. de Goncourt, _La Duchesse de Châteauroux et ses soeurs_\r\n  (1879); Toussaint, _Anecdotes curieuses de ... Louis XV._ (2 vols.,\r\n  1905); J. B. H. R. Capefigue, _Mesdemoiselles de Nesle et la jeunesse\r\n  de Louis XV._ (1864).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMANA, a town and khanate of Afghan Turkestan. The town is situated\r\n100 m. S.W. of Balkh, and only some 25 m. from the frontier of Russian\r\nTurkestan. It is about two-thirds the size of Herat, square built and\r\nsurrounded by a ruined wall and moat. The khanate was for long in\r\ndispute between Bokhara and Kabul, but in 1868 Abdur Rahman laid siege\r\nto the town, and it was compelled to come to terms. Its political status\r\nas an Afghan province was definitely fixed by the Russo-Afghan boundary\r\ncommission of 1885. The inhabitants are chiefly Uzbegs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMAND, a town in the province of Fars, Persia, a few miles east of\r\nFiruzabad and about 70 m. from Shiraz. It has a population of about\r\n5000, almost wholly occupied with the manufacture and sale of\r\nrose-water, which is largely exported to many parts of Persia as well as\r\nto Arabia, India and Java. The district also produces great quantities\r\nof almonds. The rose gardens cover several square miles. In 1349 a\r\ngreat part of Maimand and of three little villages belonging to it\r\nbecame _wakf_ (pious endowment) of the shrine at Shiraz of Mïr Ahmed,\r\nsurnamed Shah Chiragh, a son of Musa Kazim, the seventh imam of the\r\nShiahs, and the remainder of the Maimand grounds was given to the shrine\r\nby Mir Habbib Ullah Sharifi and by Shah Ismail in 1504; the\r\nadministration of the Maimand property as well as the guardianship of\r\nthe shrine is still with the descendants of Mir Habbib Ullah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMBOURG, LOUIS (1610-1686), French Jesuit and historian, was born at\r\nNancy. He entered the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen, and after\r\nstudying at Rome became a classical master in the Jesuit college at\r\nRouen. He afterwards devoted himself to preaching, but with only\r\nmoderate success. After having taken some part in minor controversies he\r\nthrew himself with energy into the dispute which had arisen as to the\r\nGallican liberties; for his _Traité historique sur les prérogatives de\r\nl'Église de Rome_ (1682) he was by command of Innocent XI. expelled from\r\nthe Society, but rewarded by Louis XIV. with a residence at the abbey of\r\nSt Victor, Paris, and a pension. He died on the 13th of August 1686. His\r\nnumerous works include histories of Arianism, the iconoclastic\r\ncontroversy, the Greek schism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and of the\r\npontificates of Leo I. and Gregory I.; they are mere compilations,\r\nwritten indeed in a very lively and attractive style, but inaccurate and\r\nuntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n  _The History of Arianism_ was published in English (1728-1729) by\r\n  William Webster, with an appendix on the English writers in the\r\n  Socinian and Arian controversies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMING, mutilation, a physical injury which involves the loss of, or\r\nincapacity to use, a bodily member. The verb \"to maim,\" in M. E.\r\n_maynhe_, _mahayme_, _mayme_, &c. was adopted from O. Fr. _mahaignier_:\r\ncf. It. _magagnars_, Med. Lat. _mahemiare_, _mahennare_, &c. (see Du\r\nCange, _Gloss._, _s.v._ \"Mahamium\"). Maiming or mutilation is and has\r\nbeen practised by many races with various ethnical and religious\r\nsignificances, and was a customary form of punishment on the principle\r\nof an \"eye for an eye\" (see MUTILATION). In law \"maiming\" is a criminal\r\noffence; the old law term for a special case of maiming of persons was\r\n\"mayhem\" (q.v.), an Anglo-French variant form of the word. Maiming of\r\nanimals by others than their owners is a particular form of the offences\r\ngenerally grouped as \"malicious damage.\" For the purpose of the law as\r\nto this offence animals are divided into cattle, which includes horses,\r\npigs and asses, and other animals which are either subjects of larceny\r\nat common law or are usually kept in confinement or for domestic\r\npurposes. The punishment for maiming of cattle is three to fourteen\r\nyears' penal servitude. Malicious injury to other animals is a\r\nmisdemeanour punishable on summary conviction. For a second offence the\r\npenalty is imprisonment with hard labour for over twelve months.\r\n(Malicious Damage Act 1861.) Maiming of animals by their owner falls\r\nunder the Cruelty to Animals Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMON, SALOMON (1754-1800), German philosopher, was born of Jewish\r\nparentage in Polish Lithuania, and died at Nieder-Siegersdorf on the\r\n22nd of November 1800. He married at the age of twelve, and studied\r\nmedicine in Berlin. In 1770 he severed his connexion with his orthodox\r\nco-religionists by his critical commentary on the _Moreh Nebuhim_ of\r\nMaimonides, and devoted himself to the study of philosophy on the lines\r\nof Wolff and Moses Mendelssohn. After many vicissitudes he found a\r\npeaceful residence in the house of Count Kalkreuth at Nieder-Siegersdorf\r\nin 1790. During the ensuing ten years he published the works which have\r\nmade his reputation as a critical philosopher. Hitherto his life had\r\nbeen a long struggle against difficulties of all kinds. From his\r\nautobiography, it is clear that his keen critical faculty was developed\r\nin great measure by the slender means of culture at his disposal. It was\r\nnot till 1788 that he made the acquaintance of the Kantian philosophy,\r\nwhich was to form the basis of his lifework, and as early as 1790 he\r\npublished the _Versuch über die Transcendentalphilosophie_, in which he\r\nformulates his objections to the system. He seizes upon the fundamental\r\nincompatibility of a consciousness which can apprehend, and yet is\r\nseparated from, the \"thing-in-itself.\" That which is object of thought\r\ncannot be outside consciousness; just as in mathematics [root](-1) is an\r\nunreal quantity, so \"things-in-themselves\" are _ex hypothesi_ outside\r\nconsciousness, i.e. are unthinkable. The Kantian paradox he explains as\r\nthe result of an attempt to explain the origin of the \"given\" in\r\nconsciousness. The _form_ of things is admittedly subjective; the mind\r\nendeavours to explain the _material_ of the given in the same terms, an\r\nattempt which is not only impossible but involves a denial of the\r\nelementary laws of thought. Knowledge of the given is, therefore,\r\nessentially incomplete. Complete or perfect knowledge is confined to the\r\ndomain of pure thought, to logic and mathematics. Thus the problem of\r\nthe \"thing-in-itself\" is dismissed from the inquiry, and philosophy is\r\nlimited to the sphere of pure thought. The Kantian categories are,\r\nindeed, demonstrable and true, but their application to the given is\r\nmeaningless and unthinkable. By this critical scepticism Maimon takes up\r\na position intermediate between Kant and Hume. Hume's attitude to the\r\nempirical is entirely supported by Maimon. The casual concept, as given\r\nby experience, expresses not a necessary objective order of things, but\r\nan ordered scheme of perception; it is subjective and cannot be\r\npostulated as a concrete law apart from consciousness. The main argument\r\nof the _Transcendentalphilosophie_ not only drew from Kant, who saw it\r\nin MS., the remark that Maimon alone of his all critics had mastered the\r\ntrue meaning of his philosophy, but also directed the path of most\r\nsubsequent criticism.\r\n\r\n  Maimon's chief works, in addition to the above quoted, are _Philos.\r\n  Wörterbuch_ (1791); _Streifereien im Gebiete der Philos._(1793); _Über\r\n  die Progresse der Philos._ (1793); _Die Kategorien des Aristoteles mit\r\n  Anmerkungen erläutert_ (1794); _Versuch einer neuen Logik_ (1794 and\r\n  1798); _Kritische Untersuchungen über den menschl. Geist_ (1797). See\r\n  _S. Maimons Lebensgeschichte von ihm selbst beschrieben_ (1792, ed. K.\r\n  P. Moritz; Eng. trans. by J. C. Murray, 1888); Wolff, _Maimoniana_\r\n  (1813); Witte, _S. Maimon_ (1876).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIMONIDES, the common name of RABBI MOSES BEN MAIMON (1135-1204), also\r\nknown from the initials of these last words as RAMBAM, Jewish\r\nphilosopher. His life falls into three epochs, which may be typified by\r\nthe towns in which they were passed, viz. Cordova, Fez and Cairo. He was\r\nborn in Cordova on the 20th of March 1135, the eve of Passover; he had a\r\nbrother, David, and one sister. His early years were spent in his native\r\ntown, which had then just passed the zenith of its glory. The Arab\r\nrulers had fostered the development of science, art, medicine,\r\nphilosophy, literature and learning. All these influences played their\r\npart in the education of Maimonides, whose father, besides training him\r\nin all branches of Hebrew and Jewish scholarship, implanted in the youth\r\na sound knowledge of these secular studies as well. In 1148 Cordova was\r\ntaken from the last Fatimite caliph by the victorious Almohades, who had\r\nspread over Spain from N. Africa. These militant revivalists strove to\r\nre-establish Islam in what they considered its primitive simplicity.\r\nThey laid great stress on the unity of God, and tolerated neither schism\r\nwithin the faith nor dissent without. The position of the orthodox\r\nSpanish Jews became intolerable, and Maimon, after ten years of\r\nhardships, wanderings and escapes, decided to take his family out of the\r\ncountry. He settled in Fez. The years which Maimonides spent there\r\n(1160-1165) were memorable for his friendship with Abdul Arab Ibn\r\nMuisha--a Moslem poet and theologian--and for the commencement of his\r\nliterary activity. His energies were diverted towards stimulating the\r\nreligious feelings of his brethren and combating assimilation. In\r\nconsequence he became alarmed for his own safety, and in 1165 left for\r\nEgypt, where he settled after a passing visit to the Holy Land. Cordova\r\ntaught him the humanities; Fez humanity. Cairo, besides giving him\r\nprominence at court and in the Jewish community, was the centre of the\r\nalmost world-wide influence which he exercised over Jewry by his\r\nmonumental writings and dominant personality. By 1177 Maimonides was the\r\nrecognized chief of the Cairene congregation and consulted on important\r\nmatters by communities far and wide. Here he was joined by his most\r\nfamous disciple, Joseph Aknin. But his early life in Egypt was fraught\r\nwith deep sorrow. His father died soon after their arrival, and\r\nMaimonides himself suffered severely from prostration and sickness. His\r\nbrother David, jointly with whom he carried on a trade in gems, was\r\nshipwrecked in the Indian Ocean. With him perished the entire fortune of\r\nthe family. Forced to earn a livelihood, Maimonides turned to medicine.\r\nThe fame of his skill eventually brought him the appointment of body\r\nphysician to Saladin, to whom, it is said, he was so attached that when\r\nRichard I. wrote from Ascalon, offering him a similar post at the\r\nEnglish court, Maimonides refused. He married the sister of Ibn al Mali,\r\none of the royal secretaries. In 1186, his son Abraham was born. His\r\nremaining years were spent in ceaseless activity and in controversy,\r\nwhich he sought to avoid. He died amidst universal sorrow and\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\n  The works of Maimonides fall into three periods: (a) To the Spanish\r\n  period belong his commentary on the whole Talmud (not fully carried\r\n  out), a treatise on the calendar (_Maamar ha-ibbur_), a treatise on\r\n  logic (_Milloth Higgayon_), and his commentary on the _Mishnah_ (this\r\n  was called _Siraj_ or _Maor_, i.e. \"Light\": begun 1158, completed\r\n  1168 in Egypt). (b) While he was in Fez, he wrote an essay on the\r\n  Sanctification of the Name of God (_Maamar Kiddush Hashem_, _Iggereth\r\n  Hashemad_). (c) The works written in Egypt were: Letter to the\r\n  Yemenites (_Iggereth Teman_ or _Pethah Tiqvah_); _Responsa_ on\r\n  questions of law; Biblical and Rabbinical Code (_Misnheh Torah_ or\r\n  _Yad Hahazaka_, completed 1180); _Sepher hamitzvoth_, an abbreviated\r\n  handbook of the preceding; and his great philosophical work _Moreh\r\n  Nebuhim_ or \"the guide of the perplexed\" (1190). To these must be\r\n  added certain portions of the _Mishnah_ commentary, such as the \"Eight\r\n  Chapters,\" the discussion on reward and punishment and immortality,\r\n  the Jewish Creed, which have acquired fame as independent works.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Moses ben Maimon is incalculable. \"From Moses unto\r\nMoses there arose not one like Moses,\" is the verdict of posterity.\r\nMaimonides was the great exponent of reason in faith and toleration in\r\ntheology. One of the main services to European thought of the \"Guide\"\r\nwas its independent criticism of some of Aristotle's principles. His\r\ncodification of the Talmud was equally appreciated in the study of the\r\nscholar and in practical life. Christian Europe owed much to Maimonides.\r\nNot only did his \"Guide\" influence scholasticism in general, but it was\r\nfrom his Code that the Church derived its medieval knowledge of the\r\nSynagogue.\r\n\r\n  A complete bibliography will be found in _Maimonides_, by David Yellin\r\n  and Israel Abrahams (London, 1903); the final chapter of that work\r\n  gives a summary of the influence of Maimonides on Christian\r\n  philosophers such as Aquinas, and Jewish such as Spinoza. The \"Guide\"\r\n  has been translated into English by M. Friedlander (1881-1885; new\r\n  ed., 1905). See also _Jewish Encyclopedia_, articles _s.v._, and the\r\n  volumes edited by Guttmann, _Moses ben Maimon_ (Leipzig, 1908, &c.).\r\n       (H. Le.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN (Lat. _Moenus_), a river of Germany, and the most important\r\nright-bank tributary of the Rhine. It has two sources, the Weisse Main\r\n(White Main), which rises in the Fichtelgebirge on the east side of the\r\nOchsenkopf, and the Rote Main (Red Main), which, rising on the eastern\r\nslope of the Frankish Jura, flows past Bayreuth. They unite 3 m. below\r\nKulmbach, 920 ft. above the sea. Hence the river, already of\r\nconsiderable size, pursues a north-westerly direction, skirting the\r\nspurs of the Frankish Jura in a pleasant valley. At Lichtenfels the\r\nriver takes a south-westerly course, which it retains until entering the\r\nfertile basin of Bamberg. Here it receives from the south-east the\r\nwaters of its chief tributary, the Regnitz, and enters upon its middle\r\ncourse. Its direction is now again north-west, and meandering through\r\npleasant vales and pastures it passes Hassfurt and reaches Schweinfurt.\r\nIts course is now almost due south to Ochsenfurt, when it again proceeds\r\nnorth-west. Continuing in this direction amid vine-clad hills, it washes\r\nthe walls of the university city of Würzburg, and thence, dividing the\r\nforest-clad ranges of the Spessart and the Odenwald, reaches Gemünden.\r\nHere it is joined from the right by the Frankish Saale and, turning\r\nabruptly south, receives at Wertheim the beautiful Tauber. Feudal\r\ncastles and medieval towns now crown its banks, notably, Freudenberg and\r\nMiltenberg. From the latter it proceeds due north to Aschaffenburg,\r\nwhence passing Frankfort it pours its yellow waters into the green\r\nwaters of the Rhine just above Mainz. The Main has a total length of 310\r\nm. and drains a basin of approximately 11,000 sq. m. It is navigable\r\nfrom the confluence of the Regnitz, 240 m. from its mouth, for barges\r\nand other small craft, and through the Ludwig Canal is connected with\r\nthe Danube.\r\n\r\n  See Ulrici, _Das Maingebiet in seiner natürlichen Beschaffenheit_\r\n  (Kassel, 1885); E. Faber, _Zur Hydrographie des Maingebiets_ (Munich,\r\n  1895), and Lill, _Mainthal, Main und Mainschiffahrt_ (Berlin, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN (from the Aryan root which appears in \"may\" and \"might,\" and Lat.\r\n_magnus_, great), a word meaning properly power or strength, especially\r\nphysical. This use chiefly survives in the expression \"with might and\r\nmain.\" The word is more common as a substantival elliptical use of the\r\nadjective, which usually has the sense of principal or chief in size,\r\nstrength, importance, &c. Thus \"the main,\" the high open sea, is for\r\n\"main sea,\" cf. \"mainland,\" the principal part of a territory excluding\r\nislands and sometimes far-projecting peninsulas. The expression \"the\r\nSpanish main\" properly meant that part of the main land of the N.E.\r\ncoast of South America stretching from the Orinoco to the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, and the former Spanish possessions in Central America bordering\r\non the Caribbean Sea, but it is often loosely used, especially in\r\nconnexion with the buccaneers, of the Caribbean Sea itself. The term\r\n\"main\" is also thus used of a principal pipe or cable for conducting\r\ngas, water, electricity, &c. The elliptical use does not appear,\r\nhowever, in such expressions as main road, line, stream. Another use of\r\nthe word \"main\" has a somewhat obscure history. It appears as a term in\r\nthe game of hazard, and also in cock-fighting. In the last it is used\r\nfor a match, and for the cocks engaged in a match. In hazard it is the\r\nnumber called by the \"caster\" before the dice are thrown; this may be\r\nany number from five to nine inclusive. The usual derivation is from the\r\nFrench _main_, a hand, but according to the _New English Dictionary_\r\nthere is no evidence for this, and the more probable explanation is that\r\nit is an adaptation of \"main\" meaning principal or chief. From this use\r\nof the word in hazard the expression \"main chance\" is derived. \"Main,\" a\r\nshortened form of domain or demesne, only now survives in Scotland,\r\nusually in the plural \"mains\" for a home farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINA (or MANI) and MAINOTES, a district and people of the Peloponnesus,\r\nthe modern Morea. Maina is the country occupied by the mountain range of\r\nTaygetus from Sparta to Cape Matapan, the ancient Taenarum. It is now\r\ndivided between the modern districts Oetylos and Gythion. Before the\r\norganization of the present kingdom of Greece, Maina was subdivided into\r\n[Greek: Exô Manê], Outer Maina, from the frontier of Kalamata, on the\r\nGulf of Messenia, to Vitylo (Oetylos) and inland to the summit of\r\nTaygetus; [Greek: Katô Manê], Lower Maina, from Vitylo to Cape Matapan;\r\nand [Greek: Mesa Manê], or Inner Maina, on the east, and on the Gulf of\r\nLaconia as far as the plain of Elos. It contained over a hundred\r\nvillages. The country is mountainous and inaccessible, a formation to\r\nwhich it owes its historical importance. The Mainotes claim to descend\r\nfrom the Spartans, and probably represent the Eleuthero, or free,\r\nLaconians who were delivered by Rome from the power of Sparta, as is\r\nsuggested by the traces of ancient Greek in their dialect and by their\r\nphysical type. Their country being a natural fortress, they were able to\r\ndefend themselves against the Byzantine emperors, the barbarians who\r\nbroke into the empire, the Latin princes of Achaea of the house of\r\nVillehardouin, and the Turks. As their country is also poor and\r\nmaritime, they were early tempted to take to piratical adventure. Gibbon\r\nsays that \"in the time of Constantine Porphyrogenitus they had acquired\r\nthe name of Mainotes, under which they dishonour the claim of liberty by\r\nthe inhuman pillage of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shore.\"\r\nTheir neighbours gave their country the name of \"Kakaboulia\"--the land\r\nof wicked counsels. The passes of their mountains were elaborately\r\nfortified and their villages were full of fortified towers (_pyrgoi_)\r\nfrom which they formed their own favourite epithet, Maina\r\nPolypyrgos--many-towered Maina. On the western side it also contains the\r\nremains of feudal keeps, erected by William II. de Villehardouin\r\n(1245-1278) and other Latin princes of Achaea. The Mainotes did not\r\nbecome Christians till the 9th century. From the 15th till the 17th\r\ncentury they recognized a family which claimed to belong to the Comneni\r\nof Trebizond as head chiefs. But the real power was in the hands of the\r\nchiefs of the different families and villages, who formed a turbulent\r\nand martial aristocracy. Enduring and ferocious feuds were common among\r\nthem. In the course of the 18th century the family of Mavromicheli\r\n(Black Michael), which belonged to lower Maina, established a general\r\nheadship over the Mainotes after much strife and many murders. When\r\nRussia endeavoured to promote a rising against the Turks in the Morea in\r\n1770 the Mainotes acted with her, and the strength of their country\r\nenabled them to escape the vengeance of the Turks when the Christians\r\nwere cynically deserted by the Russians. In 1777 their practical\r\nindependence was recognized by the sultan's officers. During the Greek\r\nwar of independence the Mainotes were chiefly led by Petros (Petro Bey)\r\nMavromicheli, known to his countrymen as the king of Maina, who\r\nundoubtedly cherished the hope of establishing a principality for\r\nhimself. The freedom of Greece, for which he had fought in his own way,\r\nproved the ruin of his ambition. He found the new order less compatible\r\nwith his schemes than the Turkish dominion. Petro Bey was imprisoned by\r\nthe Greek president Capodistrias (see CAPO D'ISTRIA, COUNT.), who was in\r\nrevenge murdered by the Mavromichelis. The family were finally content\r\nto become courtiers and officials in the reign of King Otto I. In the\r\n19th century Maina was but little affected by civilization, except in so\r\nfar as the efficiency of modern navies debarred the Mainotes from their\r\nold resource of piracy.\r\n\r\n  See W. Martin Leake, _Travels in the Morea_ (1830); M. E. Yemeniz, \"La\r\n  Maina,\" in _Revue des deux mondes_ (March 1, 1865); and Philipson,\r\n  \"Zur Ethnographie des Peloponnes,\" in _Petermanns Mittheilungen_, vol.\r\n  36 (Gotha).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE, ANNE LOUISE BÉNÉDICTE DE BOURBON, DUCHESSE DU (1676-1753),\r\ndaughter of Henri Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé and Anne of Bavaria,\r\nwas born on the 8th of November 1676. On the 19th of March 1692 she\r\nmarried Louis Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine, son of Louis XIV. and\r\nMme de Montespan. The duchesse du Maine held a little court at Sceaux,\r\nwhere she gave brilliant entertainments and immersed herself in\r\npolitical intrigues. Displeased with the action of the regent Orleans in\r\ndegrading the illegitimate children of Louis XIV. from their precedence\r\nabove the peers of France, she induced her husband to join in the\r\nCellamare conspiracy for the transference of the regency to the king of\r\nSpain. The plot, however, was discovered, and she was imprisoned in\r\n1719. The following year she returned to Sceaux, where she resumed her\r\nsalon and gathered round her a brilliant company of wits and poets. She\r\ndied in Paris on the 23rd of January 1753.\r\n\r\n  See Général de Piépape, _La Duchesse du Maine_ (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE, SIR HENRY JAMES SUMNER (1822-1888), English comparative jurist\r\nand historian, son of Dr James Maine, of Kelso, Roxburghshire, was born\r\non the 15th of August 1822. He was at school at Christ's Hospital, and\r\nthence went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1840. At Cambridge he\r\nwas one of the most brilliant classical scholars of his time. He won a\r\nCraven scholarship and graduated as senior classic in 1844, being also\r\nsenior chancellor's medallist in classics. Shortly afterwards he\r\naccepted a tutorship at Trinity Hall. In 1847 he was appointed regius\r\nprofessor of civil law, and he was called to the bar three years later;\r\nhe held this chair till 1854. Even the rudiments of Roman law were not\r\nthen included in the ordinary training of English lawyers; it was\r\nassumed at the universities that any good Latin scholar could qualify\r\nhimself at short notice for keeping up such tradition of civilian\r\nstudies as survived. Maine cannot have known much Roman law in 1847,\r\nbut in 1856 he contributed to the _Cambridge Essays_ the essay on Roman\r\nlaw and legal education, republished in the later editions of _Village\r\nCommunities_, which was the first characteristic evidence of his genius.\r\nMeanwhile he had become one of the readers appointed by the Inns of\r\nCourt, in the first of their many half-hearted attempts at legal\r\neducation, in 1852. Lectures delivered by Maine in this capacity were\r\nthe groundwork of _Ancient Law_ (1861), the book by which his reputation\r\nwas made at one stroke. Its object, as modestly stated in the preface,\r\nwas \"to indicate some of the earliest ideas of mankind, as they are\r\nreflected in ancient law, and to point out the relation of those ideas\r\nto modern thought.\" Within a year of its publication the post of legal\r\nmember of council in India was offered to Maine, then a junior member of\r\nthe bar with little practice, few advantages of connexion, and no\r\npolitical or official claims. He declined once, on grounds of health;\r\nthe very next year the office was again vacant. This time Maine was\r\npersuaded to accept, not that his health had improved, but that he\r\nthought India might not make it much worse. It turned out that India\r\nsuited him much better than Cambridge or London. His work, like most of\r\nthe work done by Englishmen in India in time of peace, was not of a\r\nshowy kind--its value is shown by the fact that he was asked to prolong\r\nhis services beyond the regular term of five years, and returned to\r\nEngland only in 1869. The subjects on which it was his duty to advise\r\nthe government of India were as much political as legal. They ranged\r\nfrom such problems as the land settlement of the Punjab, or the\r\nintroduction of civil marriage to provide for the needs of unorthodox\r\nHindus, to the question how far the study of Persian should be required\r\nor encouraged among European civil servants. On the civil marriage\r\nquestion in particular, and some years earlier on the still more\r\ntroublesome one of allowing the remarriage of native converts to\r\nChristianity, his guidance, being not only learned but statesmanlike,\r\nwas of the greatest value. Plans of codification, moreover, were\r\nprepared, and largely shaped, under Maine's direction, which were\r\ncarried into effect by his successors, Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen and Dr\r\nWhitley Stokes. The results are open to criticism in details, but form\r\non the whole a remarkable achievement in the conversion of unwritten and\r\nhighly technical law into a body of written law sufficiently clear to be\r\nadministered by officers to many of whom its ideas and language are\r\nforeign. All this was in addition to the routine of legislative and\r\nconsulting work and the establishment of the legislative department of\r\nthe government of India on substantially its present footing.\r\n\r\nMaine's power of swiftly assimilating new ideas and appreciating modes\r\nof thought and conduct remote from modern Western life came into contact\r\nwith the facts of Indian society at exactly the right time, and his\r\ncolleagues and other competent observers expressed the highest opinion\r\nof his work. In return Maine brought back from his Indian office a store\r\nof knowledge which enriched all his later writings, though he took India\r\nby name for his theme only once. This essay on India was his\r\ncontribution to the composite work entitled _The Reign of Queen\r\nVictoria_ (ed. T. H. Ward, 1887). Not having been separately published,\r\nit is perhaps the least known of Maine's writings; but its combination\r\nof just perception and large grasp with command of detail is not easily\r\nmatched outside W. Stubbs's prefaces to some of the chronicles in the\r\nRolls series, and (more lately) F. W. Maitland's monographs. As\r\nvice-chancellor of the university of Calcutta, Maine commented, with his\r\nusual pregnant ingenuity, on the results produced by the contact of\r\nEastern and Western thought. Three of these addresses were published,\r\nwholly or in part, in the later editions of _Village Communities_; the\r\nsubstance of others is understood to be embodied in the Cambridge Rede\r\nlecture of 1875, which is to be found in the same volume. The practical\r\nside of Maine's experience was not long lost to India; he became a\r\nmember of the secretary of state's council in 1871, and remained so for\r\nthe rest of his life. In the same year he was gazetted a K.C.S.I. In\r\n1869 Maine was appointed to the chair of historical and comparative\r\njurisprudence newly founded in the university of Oxford by Corpus\r\nChristi College. Residence at Oxford was not required, and the election\r\namounted to an invitation to the new professor to resume and continue in\r\nhis own way the work he had begun in _Ancient Law_. During the\r\nsucceeding years he published the principal matters of his lectures in a\r\ncarefully revised literary form: _Village Communities in the East and\r\nthe West_ (1871); _Early History of Institutions_ (1875); _Early Law and\r\nCustom_ (1883). In all these works the phenomena of societies in an\r\narchaic stage, whether still capable of observation or surviving in a\r\nfragmentary manner among more modern surroundings or preserved in\r\ncontemporary records, are brought into line, often with singular\r\nfelicity, to establish and illustrate the normal process of development\r\nin legal and political ideas.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the mastership of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where Maine had\r\nformerly been tutor, became vacant. There were two strong candidates\r\nwhose claims were so nearly equal that it was difficult to elect either;\r\nthe difficulty was solved by a unanimous invitation to Maine to accept\r\nthe post. His acceptance entailed the resignation of the Oxford chair,\r\nthough not continuous residence at Cambridge. Ten years later\r\nconsiderations of a somewhat similar kind led to his election to succeed\r\nSir William Harcourt as Whewell professor of international law at\r\nCambridge. His all too short performance in this office is represented\r\nby a posthumous volume which had not received his own final revision,\r\n_International Law_ (1888).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maine had published in 1885 his one work of speculative\r\npolitics, a volume of essays on _Popular Government_, designed to show\r\nthat democracy is not in itself more stable than any other form of\r\ngovernment, and that there is no necessary connexion between democracy\r\nand progress. The book was deliberately unpopular in tone; it excited\r\nmuch controversial comment and some serious and useful discussion.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 there appeared in the _Quarterly Review_ (clxii. 181) an article\r\non the posthumous work of J. F. M'Lennan, edited and completed by his\r\nbrother, entitled \"The Patriarchal Theory.\" The article, though\r\nnecessarily unsigned (in accordance with the rule of the _Quarterly_ as\r\nit then stood), was Maine's reply to the M'Lennan brothers' attack on\r\nthe historical reconstruction of the Indo-European family system put\r\nforward in _Ancient Law_ and supplemented in _Early Law and Custom_.\r\nMaine was generally averse from controversy, but showed on this occasion\r\nthat it was not for want of controversial power. He carried the war back\r\ninto the invader's country, and charged J. F. M'Lennan's theory of\r\nprimitive society with owing its plausible appearance of universal\r\nvalidity to general neglect of the Indo-European evidence and\r\nmisapprehension of such portions of it as M'Lennan did attempt to\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nMaine's health, which had never been strong, gave way towards the end of\r\n1887. He went to the Riviera under medical advice, and died at Cannes on\r\nthe 3rd of February 1888. He left a wife and two sons, of whom the elder\r\ndied soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nAn excellent summary of Maine's principal writings may be seen in Sir\r\nMountstuart Grant Duff's memoir. The prompt and full recognition of\r\nMaine's genius by continental publicists must not pass unmentioned even\r\nin the briefest notice. France, Germany, Italy, Russia have all\r\ncontributed to do him honour; this is the more remarkable as one or two\r\nEnglish publicists of an older school signally failed to appreciate him.\r\nMaine warned his countrymen against the insularity which results from\r\nignorance of all law and institutions save one's own; his example has\r\nshown the benefit of the contrary habit. His prominent use of Roman law\r\nand the wide range of his observation have made his works as\r\nintelligible abroad as at home, and thereby much valuable\r\ninformation--for example, concerning the nature of British supremacy in\r\nIndia, and the position of native institutions there--has been made the\r\nproperty of the world of letters instead of the peculiar and obscure\r\npossession of a limited class of British public servants. Foreign\r\nreaders of Maine have perhaps understood even better than English ones\r\nthat he is not the propounder of a system but the pioneer of a method,\r\nand that detailed criticism, profitable as it may be and necessary as in\r\ntime it must be, will not leave the method itself less valid or diminish\r\nthe worth of the master's lessons in its use. The rather small bulk of\r\nMaine's published and avowed work may be explained partly by a fine\r\nliterary sense which would let nothing go out under his name unfinished,\r\npartly by the drawbacks incident to precarious health. Maine's\r\ntemperament was averse from the labour of minute criticism, and his\r\navoidance of it was no less a matter of prudence. But it has to be\r\nremembered that Maine also wrote much which was never publicly\r\nacknowledged. Before he went to India he was one of the original\r\ncontributors to the _Saturday Review_, founded in 1855, and the inventor\r\nof its name. Like his intimate friend Fitzjames Stephen, he was an\r\naccomplished journalist, enjoyed occasional article-writing as a\r\ndiversion from official duties, and never quite abandoned it. The\r\npractice of such writing probably counted for something in the freedom\r\nand clearness of Maine's style and the effectiveness of his dialectic.\r\nHis books are a model of scientific exposition which never ceases to be\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n  See Sir A.

Po.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE, an old French province, bounded N. by Normandy, E. by Orléanais,\r\nS. by Touraine and Anjou, and W. by Brittany. Before the Roman Conquest\r\nthe region occupied by this province was inhabited by the Aulerci\r\nCenomanni and the Aulerci Diablintes; under the Roman empire it\r\nconsisted of two _civitates_ comprised in the Provincia Lugdunensis\r\nTertia--the Civitas Cenomannorum and the Civitas Diablintum, whose chief\r\ntowns were Le Mans and Jublains. These two _civitates_ were united\r\nduring the barbarian period and formed a single bishopric, that of Le\r\nMans, suffragan to the metropolitan see of Tours. Under the Merovingians\r\nand Carolingians the diocese of Le Mans corresponded to the Pagus\r\nCenomanensis, and in the feudal period to the county of Maine. In the\r\n16th century the county of Maine, with the addition of Perche, formed a\r\nmilitary government--the province of Maine. Since 1790 this province has\r\nbeen represented approximately by the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne,\r\nthe respective capitals of which are Le Mans and Laval. In 1855 the\r\nbishopric of Laval was separated from that of Le Mans. Maine was\r\nevangelized in the 3rd century by St Julian. After forming part of the\r\nkingdom of Syagrius, it was conquered by Clovis at the end of the 5th\r\ncentury. Owing to the scarcity of documents the history of Maine until\r\nthe end of the 9th century is merged in the history of the bishops of Le\r\nMans, which has come down to us in the _Actus pontificum Cenomannis in\r\nurbe degentium_ (ed. Busson-Ledru, Le Mans, 1901), composed under the\r\ndirection of Bishop Aldric (832-857). Roger (_c._ 892-_c._ 898) was\r\nperhaps the first hereditary count of Maine; the counts whose existence\r\nis certain are Hugh I. (_c._ 939-before 992), Hugh II. (before\r\n992-1015), Herbert I. (1015-1032 to 1036), Hugh III. (1032 to\r\n1036-1051), Herbert II. (1051-1062), William the Bastard (1063-1087),\r\nRobert Curthose (1087-1091), Hugh IV. (1091-1092) and Helias\r\n(1092-1110). Maine, which was in the vassalage of Anjou as early as the\r\n9th century, was united to Anjou in 1110 by the marriage of Count\r\nHelias's daughter to Fulk V., count of Anjou, and passed to the English\r\ncrown in 1154, when Henry Plantagenet (who was born at Le Mans) became\r\nking of England. In 1204, after the confiscation of the estates of John\r\nof England, Maine was united to France; in 1246 it was separated from\r\nFrance by Louis IX., who handed it over to his brother Charles, count of\r\nProvence. Again united to France in 1328, it was given in 1356 as an\r\napanage to Louis, second son of King John II., and did not definitely\r\nreturn to the French crown until 1481, after the death of Charles II.,\r\ncount of Maine. During the Hundred Years' War Maine was taken in 1425 by\r\nthe English, who lost it in 1448.\r\n\r\n  See _Histoire de l'église du Mans_, by Dom Piolin (Paris, 1851-1858),\r\n  which is useful but out of date; _Revue historique et archéologique du\r\n  Maine_ (1876); _La Province du Maine_ (1893); B. Hauréau, _Histoire\r\n  littéraire du Maine_ (1870-1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE, a North Atlantic state of the United States of America, the most\r\nnorth-easterly state in the Union, and the largest of the New England\r\ngroup. It lies between 43° 4´ and 47° 27´ 33´´ N., and between 66° 56´\r\n48´´ and 71° 6´ 41´´ W. It is bounded N.W. by the Canadian province of\r\nQuebec; N. and E. by the Canadian province of New Brunswick, from which\r\nit is separated in part by the natural barriers of the Saint John River,\r\nthe Grand (or Schoodic) Lakes, the Saint Croix River, and Passamaquoddy\r\nBay; S.S.E. by the Atlantic Ocean; and W. by New Hampshire, the\r\nPiscataqua and Salmon Falls rivers being the natural boundary lines at\r\nthe S.W. The area of the state is 33,040 sq. m., 3145 sq. m. being water\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nMaine attracts more summer visitors than any other state in the Union.\r\nThis is due to the cool and refreshing summer climate; the picturesque\r\ncoast and its many islands, which are favourite grounds for camps and\r\nsummer cottages; the mountains, and the beautiful lakes and rivers, many\r\nof which afford opportunities for good fishing and canoeing. Among the\r\nmore widely known resorts are Mount Desert Island, on which is Bar\r\nHarbor, a fashionable summer place of great beauty; Long Island, Orr's\r\nand other islands in Casco Bay; Old Orchard, with a gently sloping white\r\nsand sea-beach 9 m. long, Rangeley and Moosehead Lakes, favourite\r\nresorts of fishermen and hunters; Mt Katahdin, in the heart of the moose\r\ncountry; and Poland Springs (38 m. by rail from Portland) in\r\nAndroscoggin county, near lake Anasigunticook. About 1870, camps, summer\r\ncottages, summer hotels and boarding houses began to multiply throughout\r\nthe state. The needs of this summer population gave a new impulse and a\r\nnew turn to agriculture; and the demand for souvenirs revived among the\r\nIndians basket-weaving, moccasin-making, and such crafts.\r\n\r\n  _Physical Features._--The surface is a gently rolling upland, forming\r\n  a part of the \"New England uplands,\" above which rise isolated\r\n  mountain peaks and clusters of peaks, and below which are cut numerous\r\n  river valleys.[1] The highest peak is Mt Katahdin (5200 ft.), a little\r\n  N.E. of the centre of the state in Piscataquis county, which rises\r\n  from a comparatively level upland. South-west of Katahdin, in Franklin\r\n  county, are most of the other high peaks of the state: Saddleback\r\n  Mountain (4000 ft.), Mt Abraham (3388 ft.), Mt Bigelow (3600 ft.), and\r\n  Mt Blue (3200 ft.). A little N. of this line of mountain peaks is the\r\n  water-parting which divides the state into a north slope and a south\r\n  slope. The north slope descends gently both to the N. and to the E.;\r\n  although quite hilly in the middle and western portions it is so\r\n  poorly drained that swamps abound in all sections. The south slope\r\n  which contains nearly all the mountains and is generally more hilly,\r\n  has a mean descent toward the sea of about 7 ft. to the mile, the fall\r\n  being greater in the W., where the mountains are high at the N. and\r\n  the shore low at the S., and less to the E., where the water-parting\r\n  is lower and the shore high and rocky.\r\n\r\n  After the uplift which caused the rivers to cut below the general\r\n  \"uplands,\" and develop well marked valleys for themselves, came the\r\n  period of the great continental glaciation. The glacier or ice sheet\r\n  overran all Maine, irregularly scouring out the bed rock to produce\r\n  rock basins, damming up many river valleys with glacial deposits and\r\n  completely disarranging the drainage lines. When the ice melted, the\r\n  rock basins and the dammed-up valleys filled with water to produce\r\n  lakes. This is the origin of the numerous lakes of Maine, which give\r\n  it some of its most beautiful scenery, and help to make it a holiday\r\n  resort in summer. These lakes are about 1600 in number, are scattered\r\n  in all parts of the state, are especially numerous at high elevations,\r\n  and have an aggregate area of more than 2000 sq. m. Few other regions\r\n  have so many large lakes so variously situated, and with such beauty\r\n  of aspect and surroundings. They contribute largely to a constant\r\n  supply of water power for which the course of the rivers of S.W. Maine\r\n  are exceptionally well adapted, many of them abound in trout, salmon,\r\n  togue, black bass and pickerel; and near them there is still much\r\n  game. Moosehead Lake (about 120 sq. m.; 35 m. long and from 2 m. to 10\r\n  m. wide), on the boundary between Piscataquis and Somerset counties,\r\n  is the largest in Maine and the largest inland body of water wholly in\r\n  New England; the Kennebec River is its principal outlet and Mt Kineo\r\n  rises abruptly to about 1760 ft. above the sea (about 700 ft. above\r\n  the lake) on its eastern shore. Other lakes, such as the Rangeley\r\n  Lakes,[2] Chesuncook and Twin Lakes on the Penobscot, and the Grand or\r\n  Schoodic Lakes, in the western boundary at the head waters of the\r\n  Saint Croix River, equal or surpass Moosehead in picturesqueness. The\r\n  glacier or ice sheet, above referred to, deposited till or boulder\r\n  clay, which was compacted under the enormous pressure of the ice sheet\r\n  to form the \"hard-pan\" referred to later. The glaciation is also\r\n  responsible for the poor soil of most of the state, for, although the\r\n  rocks are the same crystallines which give good soils further south in\r\n  unglaciated regions, all the decayed portions of the Maine rocks have\r\n  been removed by glacial erosion, revealing fresh, barren rock over\r\n  great areas, or depositing the rather sterile hard-pan as a thin\r\n  coating in other places.\r\n\r\n  After the uplift came a period of subsidence, during which this region\r\n  sank one or more thousand feet, allowing the sea to encroach on the\r\n  land and run far inland into the previously made river valleys. This\r\n  depression probably occurred during the glacial period, perhaps toward\r\n  its close, and is responsible for the second most important feature of\r\n  Maine physiography, the embayed coast. To this subsidence are due the\r\n  picturesque coastal scenery, the numerous islands and bays, the good\r\n  harbours and the peculiar coast-line.\r\n\r\n  The shortest distance between the N.E. and the S.W. extremities of the\r\n  coast is only 225 m.; but, on account of projections and indentations,\r\n  the coast-line measures not less than 2500 m. The headlands, the deep\r\n  indentations and the numerous islands in the bays and beyond produce a\r\n  beautiful mingling of land and sea and give to the whole ocean front\r\n  the appearance of a fringed and tasselled border; west of the mouth of\r\n  the Kennebec River are a marshy shore and many low grassy islands; but\r\n  east of this river the shore becomes more and more bold, rising in the\r\n  precipitous cliffs and rounded summits of Mt Desert and Quoddy Head,\r\n  1527 and 1000 ft. high respectively. All along the coast-line there\r\n  are capacious and well-protected harbours, Casco, Penobscot,\r\n  Frenchman's, Machias and Passamaquoddy bays being especially\r\n  noteworthy.\r\n\r\n  After the subsidence came another period of uplift, possibly still in\r\n  progress. This uplift has brought up submarine deposits of sand, &c.,\r\n  to form little coastal plains at some points along the coast,\r\n  providing good land for settlement and clay for brick and pottery.\r\n  Further evidence of this uplift is found in old beach lines now well\r\n  above sea-level.\r\n\r\n  The principal river systems of Maine are the Saint John on the north\r\n  slope, and the Penobscot, the Kennebec, the Androscoggin, and the Saco\r\n  on the south slope. The mean height of the basin of the St John is\r\n  exceeded only by that of the Androscoggin, but the fall of the St John\r\n  River through the greater part of its course in Maine is only\r\n  sufficient to give a sluggish or a gentle current. The Penobscot,\r\n  Kennebec, Androscoggin and Saco have numerous falls and rapids.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna._--The animal life of Maine shows a mixture of northern and\r\n  southern forms, and very little that is peculiar as compared with\r\n  surrounding regions. The state has moose, caribou and deer, especially\r\n  in the northern part. The black bear, wolf, catamount, wolverine, wild\r\n  cat, fox, beaver, racoon, marten, sable, woodchuck, skunk, otter,\r\n  mink, rabbit and squirrel are also found. Geese, ducks and other water\r\n  fowl frequent the lakes and bays in the migratory season, and eagles,\r\n  gulls, hawks, kingfishers, owls, plover, woodcock, \"partridge\" (ruffed\r\n  grouse), robins, orioles, bobolinks, blue birds, swallows, sparrows,\r\n  and many other insectivorous birds are common. In the inland waters\r\n  salmon, trout, togue (_Salvelinus namaycush_), pickerel and bass\r\n  abound; along the shore there are lobsters, clams and scallops\r\n  (_Pecten irradians_); and off the shore are herring, alewives,\r\n  mackerel, cod, halibut, haddock, smelts, hake, menhaden, porgies and\r\n  porpoises. The game in the North Woods attracts large numbers of\r\n  sportsmen during the autumn season.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Map of Maine.]\r\n\r\n  _Flora._--Maine was formerly covered with forests, principally of\r\n  white pine and spruce, but mixed with these were some hemlock,\r\n  tamarack, cedar, and, on the south slope, birch, poplar, oak, maple\r\n  and beech. Chestnut and walnut are rare and are found only near the\r\n  south-west border. In 1900 about 21% of the state's area was cleared,\r\n  and much besides had once been cleared, but not being suited to\r\n  agriculture had become reforested. Of fruit trees the chief is the\r\n  apple. The plum, cherry and pear also thrive. The peach grows well\r\n  only in the south-west near the border. Species of grape, gooseberry\r\n  and currant are native, and others are cultivated with advantage. The\r\n  blackberry, raspberry, blueberry and strawberry grow wild in profusion\r\n  throughout the state.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The climate of the state is moist and, for its latitude,\r\n  cold. Extremes of temperature are not so great as farther inland in\r\n  the same latitude; for the summer heats are tempered by the sea and\r\n  the cool north winds, and the winter cold is so constant as to be less\r\n  severely felt than the changing temperature of more southern\r\n  districts. The summers are short, there being only about 4½ months\r\n  between frosts even in the southern sections, and the mean summer\r\n  temperature is about 62° F. The mean winter temperature is\r\n  approximately 20° F., and the mean annual temperature for the entire\r\n  state is 42° F., that for the north slope being about 5° F. less than\r\n  that for the south slope. Although the temperature remains pretty\r\n  steadily below the freezing point for at least three months of the\r\n  year, many of the harbours remain unobstructed; for the tides and the\r\n  prevailing off-shore winds break up and drive off the ice. The\r\n  precipitation is about 42 in. annually, and is distributed very evenly\r\n  throughout the year, 10-11 in. of rain or its equivalent in snow\r\n  falling each season. During 4½ months about 44% of the precipitation\r\n  is in the form of snow; but the snow-fall varies from about 60 in. on\r\n  the coast to more than 100 in. on the north slope. The winds are\r\n  variable; at no season of the year is it usual for them to blow from\r\n  the same direction for many days in succession. But, with the\r\n  exception of those from the west, they are maritime and consequently\r\n  moisture-bearing. In summer, especially in the latter part of it, the\r\n  cool and moist N. or N.E. winds often cause a considerable part of the\r\n  state to be enveloped in fog for several days in succession.\r\n\r\n  _Agriculture._--The soil is for the most part glacial drift,\r\n  containing a large mixture of clay with sand or gravel, and the\r\n  subsoil is mostly \"hard-pan,\" i.e. mingled clay and boulders which\r\n  have been so much compressed by glacial action as to make the mixture\r\n  hard and ledge-like. Except in the valley of the Aroostook and along\r\n  the Kennebec, the Penobscot, and some other rivers, the soil is\r\n  generally unfit for cultivation, there being too little alluvium mixed\r\n  with it to make it fertile. In the Aroostook valley, however, is the\r\n  largest undivided area of good arable land in all New England, the\r\n  soil being a deep, porous, yellow loam well adapted to the growth of\r\n  cereals and to market gardening. The most sterile regions are on the\r\n  mountains and along the coast. Because of the cold climate, the large\r\n  areas in which there is little or no good arable land, the growing\r\n  demand for timber land, and the large and constant supply of\r\n  water-power afforded by the principal rivers, agriculture in Maine, as\r\n  in all the other New England states except Vermont, is a smaller\r\n  industry than manufacturing; in 1900 there were 87,932 people engaged\r\n  in manufacturing and only 76,932 engaged in agriculture. Only 32.9% of\r\n  the state's land area was in that year included in farms, only 37.9%\r\n  of this farm land was improved, and only 16.3% of the improved land\r\n  was in crops other than hay and forage. Nevertheless, as indicated by\r\n  the unusually large proportion of farmers who either own their farms\r\n  or pay cash rent for them, farming usually is profitable. The number\r\n  of farms in 1900 was 59,299; of these 18,644 contained between 50 and\r\n  100 acres and 17,191 contained between 100 and 175 acres, the average\r\n  size being 106.2 acres; 54,263 (or 91.5%) were operated by their\r\n  owners, 775 were operated by part owners, 2030 by cash tenants, and\r\n  only 745 by share tenants. Beginning with the middle of the 19th\r\n  century, the increasing competition of the more productive soils of\r\n  the West, the growth of urban population in the state, and the number\r\n  of summer visitors effected the reforesting of much poor land and the\r\n  more intensive cultivation of the better arable land. The cultivation\r\n  of cereals, for example, has given way to a marked extent in nearly\r\n  all the farming districts except in Aroostook county to market\r\n  gardening, dairying, and egg and poultry production. The number of\r\n  dairy cows increased from 157,240 in 1890 to 183,000 in 1908, and the\r\n  annual production of milk increased from 57,969,791 gallons in 1890 to\r\n  99,586,188 gallons in 1900. The number of other neat cattle (180,878\r\n  in 1900; 151,000 in 1908) decreased during every decade from 1860 to\r\n  1900; the number of sheep in 1900 was 427,209 (31.9% less than in\r\n  1890), and in 1908 it was 267,000; but the number of horses in 1890\r\n  and 1900 was about the same (140,310 in 1960, but only 116,000 in\r\n  1908). Hay is still by far the largest crop, the acreage of it and of\r\n  forage in 1899 being 1,270,254 acres, or 76.5% of that of all crops,\r\n  and the yield was 1,133,932 tons; in 1907 the acreage was 1,400,000\r\n  acres, and the crop was 2,100,000 tons. The acreage of cereals\r\n  decreased from 187,013 in 1880, when agriculture in Aroostook county\r\n  was little developed, to 166,896 in 1899, when the cereal acreage in\r\n  Aroostook county alone was 82,069. Maine potatoes are of a superior\r\n  quality, and the acreage of this crop increased from 49,617 in 1889 to\r\n  118,000 in 1907. Sweet Indian corn, cabbages, turnips, cucumbers and\r\n  tomatoes are grown in large quantities. The fruit crop consists very\r\n  largely of apples and strawberries (1,421,773 bushels of apples and\r\n  1,066,860 quarts of strawberries in 1899). The output of eggs\r\n  increased from 9,369,534 dozen in 1889 to 13,304,150 dozen in 1899.\r\n  The most productive dairy section of the state is a belt extending\r\n  from the south-west corner N.E. entirely across the state and\r\n  embracing the whole or parts of the counties of York, Oxford,\r\n  Cumberland, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Penobscot and Aroostook.\r\n\r\n  _Lumber Industry._--Except in the remote parts, the valuable white\r\n  pine, for which Maine was long noted, has been cut; but the woodland\r\n  of the state was estimated in 1900 at 23,700 sq. m. or 79% of its\r\n  area. The tendency is for this area to increase, for the establishment\r\n  between 1890 and 1900 of large paper and pulp mills on some of the\r\n  principal rivers of the south slope greatly increased the value of\r\n  forests, especially those of spruce and poplar. The state makes large\r\n  appropriations for preventing and extinguishing forest fires, and in\r\n  1903 established a department of forestry in the university of Maine.\r\n  Good spruce, which is by far the most valuable timber in the state and\r\n  is used most largely for the manufacture of paper and pulp, stands in\r\n  large quantities in the St John, Penobscot, Androscoggin and Kennebec\r\n  basins. Poplar, also used for the manufacture of paper, abounds in\r\n  several sections of the south slope, but is most abundant in the basin\r\n  of the Kennebec. White birch, used largely for the manufacture of\r\n  spools, is found throughout a wide belt extending across the middle of\r\n  the state. There is much cedar on the north slope. Oak, maple and\r\n  beech are rather scarce. A new growth of white pine and other timber\r\n  is gradually becoming valuable. The value of the timber product\r\n  increased from $11,849,654 in 1890 to $13,489,401 in 1900, and to\r\n  $17,937,683 in 1905.\r\n\r\n  _Fisheries._--Fishing has always been an important industry in Maine.\r\n  From 1901 to 1904 inclusive, the average annual catch amounted to\r\n  195,335,646 lb., and its average value was $5,557,083. In 1908,\r\n  according to state reports, the catch was 185,476,343 lb., valued at\r\n  $3,849,900. Herrings are caught in largest quantities (in 1908,\r\n  according to state reports, 68,210,800 lb., valued at $450,665), and\r\n  Maine is noted for the canning of the smaller herrings under the name\r\n  of \"sardines.\" In 1908, according to state reports, the take of\r\n  lobsters was 17,635,980 lb. valued at $1,558,252. Maine markets more\r\n  clams than any other state in the Union, and the catches of cod, hake,\r\n  haddock, smelt, mackerel, swordfish, shad, pollock, cusk, salmon,\r\n  alewives, eels and halibut are of importance. The scallop fishery is\r\n  becoming more and more valuable. For the protection and promotion of\r\n  the lobster fishery the United States government has established a\r\n  lobster hatchery at Boothbay Harbor; and the state legislature enacted\r\n  a law in 1895 prohibiting the taking of lobsters less than 10-1/2 in.\r\n  in length (one effect of this law being to drive the lobster-canning\r\n  industry from the state) and another law in 1903 for the protection of\r\n  lobsters with eggs attached. This latter law directs the state fish\r\n  commissioner to purchase such lobsters whenever caught and either to\r\n  liberate them or to sell them to the United States for keeping in a\r\n  fish hatchery.\r\n\r\n  _Minerals._--The principal mineral products are granite, limestone,\r\n  slate, clay products and mineral waters. In 1905 Maine held first rank\r\n  among the states of the Union as a producer of granite, the value of\r\n  the output being $2,713,795. In 1907 Maine's granite was valued at\r\n  $2,146,420, that of Massachusetts at $2,328,777, and that of Vermont\r\n  at $2,693,889. The stone is of superior quality, and the largest part\r\n  of it is used for building purposes; much of it is used as paving\r\n  blocks and some for monuments. It abounds all along the coast east of\r\n  the Kennebec and on the adjacent islands, and is found farther inland,\r\n  especially about the Rangeley lakes in Franklin and Oxford counties,\r\n  and, near Mt Katahdin, in Penobscot and Piscataquis counties. The\r\n  principal quarries, however, are situated in positions most convenient\r\n  for shipment by water, in the vicinity of Penobscot bay and in\r\n  Kennebec county, and these have supplied the bulk of the material used\r\n  in the construction of many prominent buildings and monuments in the\r\n  United States. The Fox Island granite comes from the quarries on\r\n  Vinalhaven Island and the surrounding islands, and on Vinalhaven were\r\n  quarried monolithic columns 51.5 to 54 ft. long and 6 ft. in diameter\r\n  for the Cathedral of St John the Divine in New York City. Black\r\n  granite was quarried in 1907 at 12 quarries, in York, Lincoln, Waldo,\r\n  Penobscot and Washington counties. Limestone abounds, especially in\r\n  the south-east part of the state, but it is quarried chiefly in Knox\r\n  county. As its colour--blue and blue-black streaked with\r\n  white--renders it undesirable for building purposes, nearly all of it\r\n  is burned into lime, which has become a very important article of\r\n  manufacture in the city of Rockland; the industry dates back to 1733\r\n  in Knox county. In 1907 the quantity of lime burned in Maine was\r\n  159,494 tons and its value was $747,947. Slate is quarried chiefly in\r\n  Piscataquis county, most of it being used for roofing, but some for\r\n  blackboards; in 1907 the amount quarried in Maine was valued at\r\n  $236,106. About 1896 some remarkably white and pure feldspar began to\r\n  be quarried in Androscoggin, Oxford and Sagadahoc counties, but\r\n  afterwards the spar mined in Maine was of less excellent quality; in\r\n  1907 the production in Maine was valued at $157,334, the total for the\r\n  entire country being $499,069. Clay is obtained in various places, and\r\n  in 1905 the total value of the clay products was $619,294. In Oxford\r\n  county tourmaline, spodumene (or kunzite) and beryl occur, the\r\n  tourmaline crystals being notably large and beautiful. Mineral water\r\n  occurs in many localities, particularly in Androscoggin, York,\r\n  Cumberland and Oxford counties; the most famous springs are the Poland\r\n  Springs in Androscoggin county. Most of the mineral waters bottled in\r\n  the state are chalybeate and slightly alkaline--saline; their average\r\n  temperature is about 43°. In 1908 27 springs were reported, their\r\n  aggregate sales amounting to 1,182,322 gallons. Copper, gold alloyed\r\n  with platinum, iron ore, barytes, graphite and lead occur in small\r\n  quantities in the state. In 1908 the total mineral product of the\r\n  state was valued at $7,044,678.\r\n\r\n  _Manufactures._--Although Maine has no coal and only a very small\r\n  amount of iron ore within her borders for the encouragement of\r\n  manufacturing, yet the abundance of fine timber and the numerous\r\n  coves, bays and navigable streams along or near the coast promoted\r\n  ship-building from the first, and this was the leading industry of the\r\n  state until about the middle of the 19th century, when wooden ships\r\n  began to be supplanted by those of iron and steel. Until about the\r\n  same time, when the Maine liquor law was passed, the manufacture of\r\n  rum from molasses, received in exchange for lumber and fish in the\r\n  West Indies, was also an important industry. It was not until early in\r\n  the 19th century that the large and constant supply of water power\r\n  afforded by the rivers began to be used to any considerable extent.\r\n  The first cotton mill was built at Brunswick on the Androscoggin about\r\n  1809, and from 1830 the development of cotton manufacturing was rapid;\r\n  woollen mills followed, and late in the 19th century were erected some\r\n  of the largest paper and pulp mills in the country, which are run by\r\n  water power from the rivers, and use the spruce and poplar timber in\r\n  the river basins. The total value of the manufactures of the state\r\n  increased from $95,689,500 in 1890 to $127,361,485 in 1900; and in\r\n  1905 the value of factory-made products alone was $144,020,197, or\r\n  27.5% greater than their value in 1900.[3] Measured by the value of\r\n  the output, paper and wood pulp rose from fifth among the state's\r\n  manufactures in 1890 to third in 1900 and to first in 1905; from\r\n  $3,281,051 in 1890 to $13,223,275 in 1900, an increase of 303% within\r\n  the decade, and to $22,951,124 in 1905, a further increase of 73.6% in\r\n  this period. Lumber and timber products ranked second\r\n  (1905)--$11,849,654 in 1890, $13,489,401 in 1900, and $17,937,683 in\r\n  1905. Cotton goods ranked third (1905) in value--$15,316,909 in 1890,\r\n  $14,631,086 in 1900, and $15,404,823 in 1905. Woollen goods ranked\r\n  fourth (1905)--$8,737,653 in 1890, $13,744,126 in 1900, an increase of\r\n  57.3% within the decade; and the value of the factory-made product\r\n  alone in 1905 was $13,969,600, or 20.1% greater than in 1900. Boots\r\n  and shoes ranked fifth (1905)--$12,295,847 in 1900, and $12,351,293 in\r\n  1905. Fish, canned and preserved, followed next, $1,660,881 in 1890\r\n  and $4,779,773 in 1900, an increase within the decade of 187.8%, most\r\n  of which was in one branch--the canning of small herring under the\r\n  name \"sardines\"; from 1900 to 1905 the increase was slight, only\r\n  $275,358, or 5.8%. In the value of its manufactures as compared with\r\n  those of the other states of the Union, in wooden ships and boats,\r\n  Maine in 1900 and in 1905 was outranked by New York only; in canned\r\n  and preserved fish by Washington only (the value of fish canned and\r\n  preserved in Maine in 1900 was 21.7% of the total for the United\r\n  States, and in 1905 19.2%); in the output of woollen mills by\r\n  Massachusetts and Pennsylvania only; in the output of paper mills by\r\n  New York and Massachusetts only. It ranked ninth in 1900 and tenth in\r\n  1905 in the value of its cotton goods. Portland, Lewiston, Biddeford,\r\n  and Auburn are the leading manufacturing cities, and in 1905 the total\r\n  value of their manufactures was 21.5% of those of the entire state.\r\n  But from 1900 to 1905 the value of manufactures grew most rapidly in\r\n  Rockland (especially noted for lime), the increase being from\r\n  $1,243,881 to $1,822,591 (46.5%), and in Waterville, where the\r\n  increase was from $2,283,536 to $3,069,309 (34.4%). Among the largest\r\n  paper mills are those at Millinocket, in Penobscot county, at Madison\r\n  on the Kennebec river, and at Rumford Falls on the Androscoggin river.\r\n  Lewiston leads in the manufacture of cotton goods; Auburn, Bangor and\r\n  Augusta, in the manufacture of boots and shoes; Bath, in ship and boat\r\n  building; Eastport and Lubec, in canning \"sardines.\"\r\n\r\n  _Transportation and Commerce._--The south-western part of the state,\r\n  including the manufacturing, the quarrying, and much of the older\r\n  agricultural district, early had fairly satisfactory means of\r\n  transportation either by water or by rail; for the coast has many\r\n  excellent harbours, the Kennebec river is navigable for coast vessels\r\n  to Augusta, the Penobscot to Bangor, and railway service was soon\r\n  supplied for the villages of the south-west, but it was not until the\r\n  last decade of the 19th century that the forests, the farming lands,\r\n  and the summer resorts of Aroostook county were reached by a railway,\r\n  the Bangor & Aroostook. The first railway in the state, from Bangor to\r\n  Old Town, was completed in 1836, and the state's railway mileage\r\n  increased from 12 m. in that year to 245 m. in 1850, to 1377.47 m. in\r\n  1890, and to 2210.79 in January 1909. The principal railway systems\r\n  are the Maine Central, which enters every county but one, the Boston &\r\n  Maine, the Bangor & Aroostook, the Grand Trunk and the Canadian\r\n  Pacific. Lines of steamboats ply regularly between the largest cities\r\n  of the state and Boston, between Portland and New York, and between\r\n  Portland and several Canadian ports.\r\n\r\n  The foreign trade, especially that with the West Indies and with Great\r\n  Britain, decreased after 1875, and yet much trade from the West that\r\n  goes to Montreal during the warmer months passes through Portland\r\n  during the winter season. The chief exports to foreign countries are\r\n  textile fabrics, Indian corn, meat, dairy products, apples, paraffin,\r\n  boards and shooks; the chief imports from foreign countries are sugar,\r\n  molasses and wool. Fish, canned goods, potatoes, granite, lime, paper,\r\n  and boots and shoes are also exported to foreign countries to some\r\n  extent, but they are shipped in larger quantities to other states of\r\n  the Union, from which Maine receives in return cotton, coal, iron,\r\n  oil, &c. The ports of entry in Maine are Bangor, Bath, Belfast,\r\n  Castine, Eastport, Ellsworth, Houlton, Kennebunk, Machias, Portland,\r\n  Wiscasset and York.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The population in 1880 was 648,936; in 1890, 661,086; in\r\n1900, 694,466; and in 1910, 742,371.[4] From 1880 to 1900 there was an\r\nincrease of only 7%, a percentage which was exceeded in every other\r\nstate in the Union except Nevada and Vermont. Of the total population of\r\n1900, 599,291, or 86.3%, were native whites, 93,330 were foreign-born,\r\n1,319 were negroes, 798 were Indians, 119 were Chinese, and 4 were\r\nJapanese. Of the inhabitants born in the United States, 588,211, or\r\n97.8%, were natives of New England and 560,506 were natives of Maine,\r\nand of the foreign-born 67,077, or 71.8%, were natives of Canada (36,169\r\nEnglish and 30,908 French), and 10,159, or 10.8%, were natives of\r\nIreland. Of the total population, 199,734 were of foreign\r\nparentage--i.e. either one or both parents were foreign-born--and 89,857\r\nwere of Canadian parentage, both on the father's and on the mother's\r\nside (41,355 English and 48,502 French). The French-speaking inhabitants\r\nprobably number considerably more than 50,000. They are of two quite\r\ndistinct classes. One, numbering about 15,000, includes those who became\r\ncitizens by the establishment of the northern boundary in 1842 and their\r\ndescendants. They are largely of Acadian stock. The state has\r\nestablished among them a well-appointed training school for teachers,\r\nconducted in the English language, the graduates of which render\r\nexcellent service in the common schools. The other class is of\r\nFrench-Canadian immigrants, who find profitable employment in the\r\nmanufacturing centres. The colony of Swedes established by the state\r\nnear its north-eastern border in 1870 has proved in every way\r\nsuccessful. The Indians are remnants of the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy\r\ntribes, the Passamaquoddies being a little the more numerous. The\r\nPenobscots' chief gathering places are on the islands of the Penobscot\r\nriver north of Old Town; the Passamaquoddies', on the shores of\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay and the banks of the Saint Croix river.\r\n\r\nRoman Catholics are more numerous than all the Protestant sects taken\r\ntogether, having in 1906 a membership of 113,419 out of a total of\r\n212,988 in all denominations. In the last decade of the 19th century the\r\nurban population (i.e. population of places having 4,000 inhabitants or\r\nmore) increased from 226,268 to 251,685, or 11.2%; the semi-urban\r\npopulation (i.e. population of incorporated places, or the approximate\r\nequivalent, having less than 4,000 inhabitants) increased from 14,221 to\r\n26,674, or 87.5%; while the rural population (i.e. population outside of\r\nincorporated places) decreased from 420,597 to 416,134, or 1%. The\r\nprincipal cities of the state are: Portland, pop. (1910), 58,571;\r\nLewiston, 26,247; Bangor, 24,803; Biddeford, 17,079; Auburn, 15,064;\r\nAugusta (the capital), 13,211; Waterville, 11,458; Bath, 9,396;\r\nWestbrook, 8,281; and Rockland, 8,174.\r\n\r\n_Administration._--Maine has had but one state constitution; this was\r\nratified in December 1819, about three months before the admission of\r\nthe state into the Union. It admits of amendment by a two-thirds vote of\r\nboth houses of the legislature followed by a majority vote of the\r\nelectorate at the next September election; or, as provided by an\r\namendment adopted in 1875, the legislature may by a two-thirds vote of\r\neach house summon a constitutional convention. From 1819 to 1875 twelve\r\namendments were adopted; in 1875, after nine more were added, the\r\ntwenty-one were incorporated in the text; and between 1875 and 1899 nine\r\nmore were adopted. Suffrage is conferred by the constitution on all male\r\ncitizens of the United States who are at least twenty-one years of age\r\nand have, for some other reason than because of being in the military,\r\nnaval or marine service of the United States, or of being students at\r\ncollege, lived in the state for three months next preceding any\r\nelection; the following classes, however, are excepted: paupers, persons\r\nunder guardianship, Indians not taxed, and, as provided by an amendment\r\nadopted in 1892, persons intellectually incapable of reading the state\r\nconstitution in the English language or of writing their names. State\r\nelections were annual until 1897 when they were made biennial; they are\r\nheld on the second Monday in September in even numbered years, Maine\r\nbeing one of the few states in the Union in which they are not held in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n  The governor is the only executive officer of the state elected by\r\n  popular vote. There is no lieutenant-governor, the president of the\r\n  Senate succeeding to the office of governor in case of a vacancy, but\r\n  there is a council of seven members elected by the legislature (not\r\n  more than one from any one senatorial district), whose sole function\r\n  is to advise the governor. The governor's term of office is two years\r\n  (before 1879 it was one year); and the constitution further directs\r\n  that he shall be at least thirty years of age at the beginning of his\r\n  term, that he shall be a native-born citizen of the United States,\r\n  that when elected he shall have been a resident of the state for five\r\n  years, and that he shall reside in the state while in office. His\r\n  power of appointment is unusually extensive and the advice and consent\r\n  of the council (instead of that of the Senate as in other states) are\r\n  required for his appointments. He appoints all judges, coroners and\r\n  notaries public, besides all other civil and military officers for\r\n  whose appointment neither the constitution nor the laws provide\r\n  otherwise. The governor is commander-in-chief of the state militia.\r\n  Any bill of which he disapproves he can within five days after its\r\n  passage prevent from becoming a law unless it is passed over his veto\r\n  by a two-thirds vote of each house of the legislature. He and the\r\n  council examine and pass upon election returns; he may summon extra\r\n  sessions of the legislature, and he may grant pardons, reprieves, and\r\n  commutations in all cases except impeachment, but the manner of\r\n  hearing applications for pardon is in a measure prescribed by statute,\r\n  and he must present to the legislature an account of each case in\r\n  which he grants a pardon. His salary is $2,000 a year. The seven\r\n  members of the council, the secretary of state, the treasurer, the\r\n  attorney general and the commissioner of agriculture are elected\r\n  biennially by a joint ballot of the two houses of the legislature,\r\n  which also elects, one every two years, the three state assessors,\r\n  whose term is six years.\r\n\r\n  The legislature meets biennially at Augusta, the capital, and is\r\n  composed of a Senate of thirty-one members and a House of\r\n  Representatives of one hundred and fifty-one members. Members of each\r\n  house are elected for a term of two years: one senator from each\r\n  senatorial district and one to seven representatives (one for a\r\n  population of 1,500, and seven for a population of 26,250) from each\r\n  township, or, where the township or plantation has less than 1,500\r\n  inhabitants, from each representative district, according to its\r\n  population. There is a new reapportionment every ten years, counting\r\n  from 1821. Every senator and every representative must at the\r\n  beginning of his term have been for five years a citizen of the United\r\n  States, for one year a resident of the state, and for three months\r\n  next preceding his election, as well as during his term of office, a\r\n  resident of the township or district which he represents; and every\r\n  senator must be at least twenty-five years of age. All revenue bills\r\n  must originate in the House of Representatives, but to such bills the\r\n  Senate may propose amendments provided they relate solely to raising\r\n  revenue. Other bills may originate in either house. In September 1908\r\n  a constitutional amendment was adopted providing for referendum and\r\n  initiative by the people. Any bill proposed in the legislature or\r\n  passed by it must be referred to popular vote before becoming law, if\r\n  there is a referendum petition therefor signed by 10,000 voters; and a\r\n  petition signed by 12,000 voters initiates new legislation.\r\n\r\n  At the head of the department of justice is the supreme judicial\r\n  court, which consists of a chief justice and seven associate justices\r\n  appointed by the governor and council for a term of seven years. When\r\n  it sits as a law court, at least five of its justices must be present,\r\n  and it holds three such sessions annually: one at Augusta, one at\r\n  Bangor, and one at Portland. But only one of its justices is required\r\n  for a trial court, and trial courts are held two or three times a year\r\n  in each county for the trial of both civil and criminal cases which\r\n  come before it in the first instance or upon appeal. In Cumberland and\r\n  Kennebec counties there is a superior court presided over by one\r\n  justice and having extensive civil and criminal jurisdiction; and in\r\n  each of the counties there are a probate court for the settlement of\r\n  the estates of deceased persons and courts of the trial justice and\r\n  the justice of the peace for the trial of petty offences and of civil\r\n  cases in which the debt or damage involved does not exceed $20.\r\n\r\n  The principal forms of local government are the town (or township),\r\n  the plantation, the county and the city. As in other parts of New\r\n  England, the town is the most important of these. At the regular town\r\n  meeting held in March the electorate of the town assembles, decides\r\n  what shall be done for the town during the ensuing year, elects\r\n  officers to execute its decisions with limited discretion, and votes\r\n  money to meet the expenses. The principal officers are the selectmen\r\n  (usually three), town clerk, assessors, collector, treasurer, school\r\n  committee and road commissioner. A populous section of a town, in\r\n  order to promote certain financial ends, is commonly incorporated as a\r\n  village without however becoming a governing organization distinct\r\n  from the town. Maine is the only state in the Union that retains what\r\n  is known as the organized plantation. This is a governmental unit\r\n  organized from an unincorporated township having at least 200\r\n  inhabitants,[5] and its principal officers are the moderator, clerk,\r\n  three assessors, treasurer, collector, constable and school committee.\r\n  The county is a sort of intermediate organization between the state\r\n  and the towns to assist chiefly in the administration of justice,\r\n  especially in the custody of offenders, and in the making and care of\r\n  roads. Its officers are three commissioners, a treasurer, a register\r\n  of deeds, a judge and a register of probate, and a sheriff. They are\r\n  all elected: the commissioners for a term of six years, one retiring\r\n  every two years, the register of deeds and the judge and the register\r\n  of probate for a term of four years, and the others for two years.\r\n  Among other duties the commissioners care for county property, manage\r\n  county business and take charge of county roads. Maine has no general\r\n  law under which cities are chartered, and does not even set a minimum\r\n  population. A town may, therefore, be incorporated as a city whenever\r\n  it can obtain from the legislature a city charter which a majority of\r\n  its electorate prefers to a continuance under its town government;\r\n  consequently there is much variety in the government of the various\r\n  cities of the state.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of Maine the property rights of a wife are approximately\r\nequal to those of a husband. A woman does not lose nor a man acquire\r\nright to property by marriage, and a wife may manage, sell, or will her\r\nproperty without the assent of her husband. She may even receive as her\r\nown the wages of her personal labour which was not performed for her own\r\nfamily. In the absence of a will, bar or release, there is no legal\r\ndistinction between the rights of a widower in the estate of his\r\ndeceased wife and those of a widow in the estate of her deceased\r\nhusband. The grounds for divorce in the state are adultery, impotence,\r\nextreme cruelty, desertion for three consecutive years next preceding\r\nthe application, gross and confirmed habits of intoxication, cruel and\r\nabusive treatment, or a husband's gross or wanton refusal or neglect to\r\nprovide a suitable maintenance for his wife.\r\n\r\nUnder the laws of Maine a householder owning and occupying a house and\r\nlot may hold the same, or such part of it as does not exceed $500 in\r\nvalue, as a homestead exempt from attachment, except for the\r\nsatisfaction of liens for labour or material, by filing in the registry\r\nof deeds a certificate stating his desire for such an exemption,\r\nprovided he is not the owner of an exempted lot purchased from the\r\nstate; and the exemption may be continued during the widowhood of his\r\nwidow or the minority of his children. A considerable amount of personal\r\nproperty, including apparel, household furniture not exceeding $100 in\r\nvalue, a library not exceeding $150 in value, interest in a pew in a\r\nmeeting-house, and a specified amount of fuel, provisions, tools or\r\nfarming implements, and domestic animals, and one fishing boat, is also\r\nexempt from attachment.\r\n\r\nMaine was the first state in the Union to enact a law for prohibiting\r\nthe sale of intoxicating liquors. An act for restricting the sale of\r\nsuch liquors was passed in 1846; the first prohibitory act was passed,\r\nlargely through the influence of Neal Dow, in 1851; this was frequently\r\namended; and in 1884 an amendment to the constitution was adopted which\r\ndeclares the manufacture of intoxicating liquors and their sale, except\r\n\"for medicinal and mechanical purposes and the arts,\" forever\r\nprohibited. By the law enacted for enforcing this prohibition the\r\ngovernor and council appoint a state liquor commissioner from whom alone\r\nthe selectmen of a town, the mayor or aldermen of a city, are authorized\r\nto receive the liquors which may be sold within the exceptions named in\r\nthe amendment, and the selectmen, mayor or aldermen appoint an agent who\r\nalone is authorized to sell any of these liquors within their\r\njurisdiction and who is forbidden to sell any whatever to minors,\r\nIndians, soldiers and drunkards. But the law labours under the\r\ndisadvantage of all laws not vigorously sustained by general public\r\nsentiment, and is grossly violated. For the most part it is executed to\r\nthe degree demanded by local sentiment in the several municipalities,\r\nthus operating in practice much the same as a \"local option\" law. The\r\nlaw looks to checking the demand by preventing the supply; and since\r\nhabitual reliance on the stringency of law tends to the neglect of other\r\ninfluences for the removal of evils from the community, the citizens\r\nseem to absolve themselves from personal responsibility, both for the\r\nexecution of the law and for the existence of the evil itself. There has\r\nbeen a strong movement for the repeal of the law, and the question of\r\nprohibition has long been an important one in state politics.\r\n\r\nThe death penalty was abolished in Maine in 1876, restored in 1883, and\r\nagain abolished in 1887.\r\n\r\n  _Penal and Charitable Institutions._--The state penal and reformatory\r\n  institutions consist of the state prison at Thomaston, the state\r\n  (reform) school for boys at South Portland, and a state industrial\r\n  school for girls at Hallowell, established in 1875 and taken over by\r\n  the state in 1899. The two schools are not places of punishment, but\r\n  reformatory schools for delinquent boys (from 8 to 16 years of age)\r\n  and girls (from 6 to 16 years), who have been committed by the courts\r\n  for violations of law, and, in the case of girls, who, by force of\r\n  circumstances or associations, are \"in manifest danger of becoming\r\n  outcasts of society.\" The prison is in charge of a board of three\r\n  inspectors and a warden, and each of the other two institutions is in\r\n  charge of a board of trustees; the inspectors, warden, and trustees\r\n  are all appointed by the governor and council. Convicts in the prison\r\n  are usually employed in the manufacture of articles that are not\r\n  extensively made elsewhere in the state, such as carriages, harness,\r\n  furniture and brooms. The inmates of the state school for boys receive\r\n  instruction in farming, carpentry, tailoring, laundry work, and\r\n  various other trades and occupations; and the girls in the state\r\n  industrial school are trained in housework, laundering, dressmaking,\r\n  &c. Paupers are cared for chiefly by the towns and cities, those\r\n  wholly dependent being placed in almshouses and those only partially\r\n  dependent receiving aid at their homes. The charitable institutions\r\n  maintained by the state are: the military and naval orphan asylum at\r\n  Bath, the Maine institution for the blind at Portland, the Maine\r\n  school for the deaf (established in 1876, and taken over by the state\r\n  in 1897) at Portland, the Maine insane hospital at Augusta, the\r\n  Eastern Maine insane hospital at Bangor, and a school for the\r\n  feeble-minded (established in 1907) at West Pownal, each of which is\r\n  governed by trustees appointed by the governor and council, with the\r\n  exception of a part of those of the orphan asylum, who are appointed\r\n  by the corporation. Besides the strictly state institutions, there are\r\n  a number of private charitable institutions which are assisted by\r\n  state funds; among these are the eye and ear infirmary at Portland,\r\n  the Maine state sanatorium at Hebron for the treatment of\r\n  tuberculosis, and various hospitals, orphanages, &c. The national\r\n  government has a branch of the national home for disabled volunteer\r\n  soldiers at Togus, and a marine hospital at Portland.\r\n\r\n  _Education._--The school-district system was established in 1800 while\r\n  Maine was still a part of Massachusetts and was maintained by the\r\n  first school law passed, in 1821, by the state legislature; but,\r\n  beginning in the next year, one town after another received the\r\n  privilege of abolishing its districts, and in 1893 the system was\r\n  abolished by act of the legislature. A state board of education,\r\n  composed of one member from each county, was established in 1846, but\r\n  for this was substituted, in 1852, a commissioner of schools for each\r\n  county, appointed by the governor, and two years later a state\r\n  superintendent of schools was substituted for the county\r\n  commissioners. County supervision by county supervisors was tried in\r\n  1869-1872. Since these several changes the common school system has\r\n  been administered by towns and cities subject to an increasing amount\r\n  of control through enactments of the state legislature and the general\r\n  supervision of the state superintendent. The town officers are a\r\n  superintending school committee of three members and a superintendent.\r\n  The members of the committee are elected for a term of three years,\r\n  one retiring every year, and women as well as men are eligible for the\r\n  office. The superintendent may be elected by the town or appointed by\r\n  the committee, or towns having not less than twenty or more than fifty\r\n  schools may unite in employing a superintendent. In cities the\r\n  committee is usually larger than in towns and is commonly elected by\r\n  wards. Since 1889 each town and city has been required to furnish\r\n  textbooks, apparatus and supplies, without cost to the pupils. The\r\n  minimum length of the school year is fixed by a statute of 1893 at\r\n  twenty weeks; the average length is about twenty-eight weeks. A\r\n  compulsory education law, enacted in 1901, requires the attendance at\r\n  some public or approved private school of each child between the ages\r\n  of seven and fifteen during all the time that school is in session,\r\n  except that necessary absences may be excused. For the maintenance of\r\n  the common schools each town is required (since 1905) to raise\r\n  annually at least fifty-five cents _per capita_, exclusive of what may\r\n  be received from other sources, and to this is added the proceeds of a\r\n  state tax of one and a half mills on a dollar, one-half the proceeds\r\n  of the tax on savings banks, a 6% income from the permanent school\r\n  fund (derived mainly from the sale of school lands), and state\r\n  appropriations for the payment in part of the superintendence in towns\r\n  that have united for that purpose. Any section of a town may establish\r\n  and maintain a high school provided there be not more than two such\r\n  schools in one town, and the state makes appropriations for the\r\n  support of such schools equal to one-half the cost of instruction, but\r\n  the maximum grant to any one such school is $250.\r\n\r\n  The state maintains five normal schools: that at Farmington\r\n  (established 1864), that at Castine (1866), that at Gorham (1879);\r\n  that at Presque Isle (the Aroostook state normal school, 1903), and\r\n  the Madawaska training school at Fort Kent, each of which is under the\r\n  direction of a board of trustees consisting of the governor, the state\r\n  superintendent of schools, and five other members appointed by the\r\n  governor and council for not more than three years. At the head of the\r\n  public school system is the university of Maine, near the village of\r\n  Orono in Orono township (pop. in 1900, 3257), Penobscot county. This\r\n  institution was founded in 1865 as the state college of agriculture\r\n  and the mechanic arts; in 1897 the present name was adopted. It\r\n  embraces a college of arts and sciences, a college of agriculture, a\r\n  college of technology (including a department of forestry), a college\r\n  of law (at Bangor), and a college of pharmacy. The most conspicuous of\r\n  its twenty-five buildings is the library, built with funds contributed\r\n  by Andrew Carnegie. In 1908-1909 the university had 104 instructors\r\n  and 884 students, of whom 113 were in the college of law at Bangor and\r\n  420 in the college of technology. The university is maintained with\r\n  the proceeds of an endowment fund derived chiefly from public lands\r\n  given by the national government in accordance with the land grant, or\r\n  Morrill, Act of 1862 (see Morrill, Justin S.) and from the bequest\r\n  ($100,000) of Abner Coburn (1803-1885); by appropriations of Congress\r\n  under the second Morrill Act (1890), and under the Nelson Amendment of\r\n  1907, by appropriations of the state legislature, and by fees paid by\r\n  the students. Connected with the university is an agricultural\r\n  experiment station, established and maintained under the Hatch Act\r\n  (1887) and the Adams Act (1906) of the national Congress. The\r\n  government of the university is entrusted, subject to inspection of\r\n  the governor and council, to a board of eight trustees. Among the\r\n  important institutions of learning which have no official connexion\r\n  with the state are Bowdoin College (opened in 1802), at Brunswick;\r\n  Colby College (Baptist, opened in 1818), at Waterville; and Bates\r\n  College (originally Free Baptist but now unsectarian; opened in 1863),\r\n  at Lewiston. In 1900 5.1% of the state's inhabitants ten years of age\r\n  and over were illiterate (i.e. could neither read nor write, or could\r\n  read but not write); of the native whites within this age limit 2.4%\r\n  were illiterate, of the foreign whites, 19.4%. Of the foreign-born\r\n  whites 15.7% were unable to speak English.\r\n\r\n  _Finance._--The chief sources of the state's revenue are a general\r\n  property tax and taxes on the franchises of corporations, especially\r\n  those of railway and insurance companies and savings banks; among the\r\n  smaller sources are licences or fees, a poll tax, and a collateral\r\n  inheritance tax. The general property tax for state and local purposes\r\n  is assessed by local assessors, but their work is reviewed for the\r\n  purpose of equalization among the several towns and counties by a\r\n  board of state assessors, which also assesses the corporations. This\r\n  board of three members (not more than two of whom may be of the same\r\n  political party) is elected by a joint ballot of the two houses of the\r\n  legislature for a term of six years, one member retiring every two\r\n  years. The state is prohibited by the constitution from creating a\r\n  debt exceeding $300,000 except for the suppression of a rebellion, for\r\n  repelling an invasion, or for war purposes; and every city and town is\r\n  forbidden by an amendment adopted in 1877 from creating one exceeding\r\n  5% of the assessed value of its property. But the state was authorized\r\n  by an amendment adopted in 1868 to issue bonds for the reimbursement\r\n  of the expenses incurred by its cities, towns, and plantations on\r\n  account of the Civil War, and these bonds, with those issued by the\r\n  state itself during the Civil War, constituted the largest part of the\r\n  state's bonded indebtedness. The bonded debt, however, is rapidly\r\n  being paid; in January 1901 it was $2,103,000, and in January 1909\r\n  only $698,000.\r\n\r\n_History._--During the 16th century and the early part of the 17th, the\r\ncoast of Maine attracted various explorers, among them Giovanni da\r\nVerrazano (1524), Estéban Gomez (1525), Bartholomew Gosnold (1602),\r\nMartin Pring (1603), Pierre du Guast, Sieur De Monts (1604), George\r\nWeymouth (1605), and John Smith (1614), who explored and mapped the\r\ncoast and gave to the country the name New England; but no permanent\r\nEnglish settlement was established within what are now the borders of\r\nthe state until some time between 1623 and 1629. In 1603 De Monts\r\nreceived from Henry IV. of France a charter for all the region between\r\n40° and 46° N. under the name of Acadie, or Acadia, and in 1604 he built\r\na fort on Neutral Island at the mouth of the Saint Croix river. This he\r\nabandoned in 1605, but some of his followers were in the vicinity a few\r\nyears later. In the same year George Weymouth explored the south-west\r\ncoast, kidnapped five Indians, and carried them to England, where three\r\nof them lived for a time in the family of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who\r\nsoon became the leader in founding Maine. In 1607 the Plymouth Company,\r\nof which he was an influential member and which had received a grant of\r\nthis region from James I. of England in the preceding year, sent out a\r\ncolony numbering 120 under George Popham (c. 1550-1608), brother of Sir\r\nJohn Popham, and Raleigh Gilbert, son of Sir Humphrey Gilbert. The\r\ncolony established itself at the mouth of the Kennebec river in August,\r\nbut, finding its supplies insufficient, about three-fifths of its number\r\nreturned to England in December; a severe winter followed and Popham\r\ndied; then Gilbert, who succeeded to the presidency of the council for\r\nthe colony, became especially interested in his claim to the territory\r\nunder his father's charter,[6] and in 1608 the colony was abandoned. In\r\n1609 the French Jesuits Biard and Masse established a fortified mission\r\nstation on the island of Mount Desert, and although this as well as the\r\nremnant of De Monts' settlement at the mouth of the Saint Croix was\r\ntaken in 1613 by Sir Samuel Argall (d. 1626), acting under the\r\ninstructions of the English at Jamestown, Virginia, some of these\r\ncolonists returned later. In 1620 the Council for New England, the\r\nsuccessor of the Plymouth Company, obtained a grant of the country\r\nbetween latitude 40° and 48° N. extending from sea to sea, and two years\r\nlater Gorges and John Mason (1586-1635) received from the Council a\r\ngrant of the territory between the Merrimac and the Kennebec rivers for\r\n60 m. inland under the name of the Province of Maine. In 1629 they\r\ndivided their possession, Gorges taking the portion between the\r\nPiscataqua and the Kennebec. Numerous grants of land in this vicinity\r\nfollowed within a few years; and in the meantime permanent settlements\r\nat York, Saco, Biddeford, Port Elizabeth, Falmouth (now Portland) and\r\nScarborough were established in rapid succession. The Council for New\r\nEngland surrendered its charter in 1635. In the division of its\r\nterritory Gorges retained the portion previously granted to him, and the\r\nregion between the Kennebec and the Saint Croix north to the Saint\r\nLawrence, though still claimed by the French as part of Acadia, was\r\nconveyed to Sir William Alexander (1567?-1640); later, in 1664, this was\r\nconveyed to the duke of York, afterwards James II. of England.\r\n\r\nGorges named his tract the County of New Somersetshire, and immediately\r\nbegan the administration of government, setting up in 1635 or 1636 a\r\ncourt at Saco under the direction of his kinsman William Gorges. In 1639\r\nhe procured for his province a royal charter modelled after that of\r\nMaryland, which invested him with the feudal tenure of a county palatine\r\nand vice-regal powers of government. He called into existence a\r\nformidably large number of officers to govern it, but his charter was in\r\nconflict with the other (mutually conflicting) grants of the Council for\r\nNew England, east of the Piscataqua; and Gorges and his agents met with\r\na determined opposition under the leadership of George Cleeve, the\r\ndeputy-president of the Lygonia, or \"Plough\" Patent, which extended\r\nalong the coast from Cape Porpoise to Casco, and in issuing which the\r\nCouncil for New England had granted governmental as well as territorial\r\nrights. Moreover, Puritan Massachusetts, which was naturally hostile to\r\nthe Anglicanism of Gorges and his followers, interpreted her charter so\r\nas to make her northern boundary run east and west from a point 3 m.\r\nnorth of the source of the Merrimac river, and on this basis laid claim\r\nto practically the whole of Maine then settled. The factional quarrels\r\nthere, together with the Commonwealth government in England, made it\r\neasy for Massachusetts to enforce this claim at the time, and between\r\n1652 and 1658 Maine was gradually annexed to Massachusetts. In 1672\r\nMassachusetts extended her boundary eastward as far as Penobscot Bay.\r\nFerdinando Gorges, a grandson of the original proprietor, brought before\r\nparliament his claim to Maine and in 1664 a committee of that body\r\ndecided in his favour; but Massachusetts successfully resisted until\r\n1677, when the king in council decided against her. She then quietly\r\npurchased the Gorges claim for £1,250 and held the province as a\r\nproprietor until 1691, when by the new Massachusetts charter Maine was\r\nextended to the Saint Croix river, and was made an integral part of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe French still claimed all territory east of the Penobscot, and not\r\nonly was Maine an exposed frontier and battleground during the long\r\nstruggle of the English against the Indians and the French, but its\r\ncitizens bore a conspicuous part in the expeditions beyond its borders.\r\nPort Royal was taken in May 1690 by Sir William Phipps and Louisburg in\r\nJune 1745 by Sir William Pepperell, both these commanders being from\r\nMaine. These expeditions were such a drain on Maine's population that\r\nMassachusetts was called upon to send men to garrison the little forts\r\nthat protected the homes left defenceless by men who had gone to the\r\nfront. During the War of Independence, the town of Falmouth (now\r\nPortland), which had ardently resisted the claims of the British, was\r\nbombarded and burned, in 1775; in the same year Benedict Arnold followed\r\nthe course of the Kennebec and Dead rivers on his expedition to Quebec;\r\nand from 1779 to 1783 a British force was established at Castine. The\r\nembargo and non-intercourse laws from 1807 to 1812 were a severe blow to\r\nMaine's shipping, and in the War of 1812 Eastport, Castine, Hampden,\r\nBangor and Machias fell into the hands of the British.\r\n\r\nMaine was in general well governed as a part of Massachusetts, but a\r\ngeographical separation, a desire to be rid of the burden of a large\r\nstate debt, and a difference of economic interests as well as of\r\npolitics (Maine was largely Democratic and Massachusetts was largely\r\nFederalist) created a desire for an independent commonwealth. This was\r\nfelt before the close of the War of Independence and in 1785-1787\r\nconventions were held at Falmouth (Portland) to consider the matter, but\r\nthe opposition prevailed. The want of protection during the War of 1812\r\nrevived the question, and in 1816 the General Court in response to a\r\ngreat number of petitions submitted to a vote in the towns and\r\nplantations of the District the question: \"Shall the legislature be\r\nrequested to give its consent to the separation of the District of Maine\r\nfrom Massachusetts, and the erection of said District into a separate\r\nstate?\" The returns showed 10,393 yeas to 6501 nays, but they also\r\nshowed that less than one-half the full vote had been cast. Acting upon\r\nthese returns the legislature passed a bill prescribing the terms of\r\nseparation, and directed another vote of the towns and plantations upon\r\nthe question of separation and the election of delegates to a convention\r\nat Brunswick which should proceed to frame a constitution in case the\r\nsecond popular vote gave a majority of five to four for separation; but\r\nas that vote was only 11,969 yeas to 10,347 nays the advocates of\r\nseparation were unsuccessful. But a large source of opposition to\r\nseparation was removed in 1819 when Congress, dividing the east coast of\r\nthe United States into two great districts, did away with the regulation\r\nwhich, making each state a district for entering and clearing vessels,\r\nwould have required coasting vessels from the ports of Maine as a\r\nseparate state to enter and clear on every trip to or from Boston; as a\r\nconsequence, the separation measures were carried by large majorities\r\nthis year, a constitution was framed by a convention which met at\r\nPortland in October, this was ratified by town meetings in December, and\r\nMaine applied for admission into the Union. Owing to the peculiar\r\nsituation at the time in Congress, arising from the contest over the\r\nadmission of Missouri, the question of the admission of Maine became an\r\nimportant one in national politics. By an Act of the 3rd of March 1820,\r\nhowever, Maine was finally admitted into the Union as a separate state,\r\nher admission being a part of the Missouri compromise (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe boundary on the north had not yet been ascertained, and it had long\r\nbeen a subject of dispute between the United States and Great Britain.\r\nThe treaty of 1783 (Article II.) had defined the north-east boundary of\r\nthe United States as extending along the middle of the river St Croix\r\n\"from its mouth in the bay of Fundy to its source\" and \"due north from\r\nthe source of St Croix river to the highlands; along the said highlands\r\nwhich divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St\r\nLawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the\r\nnorth-westernmost head of Connecticut river; thence down along the\r\nmiddle of that river to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude.\" Great\r\nBritain claimed that the due north line was 40 m. long and ran to Mars\r\nHill in Aroostook county, and that the highlands ran thence westerly 115\r\nm. to the source of the Chaudière; the United States, on the other hand,\r\nclaimed that the northerly line was 140 m. long, running to highlands\r\ndividing the Ristigouche and the tributaries of the Metis; and there was\r\na further disagreement with regard to the side of the highlands on which\r\nthe boundary should be, and as to what stream was the \"north-westernmost\r\nhead of Connecticut river.\" The fifth article of the Jay treaty of 1794\r\nprovided for a commission to decide what the St Croix river actually\r\nwas, and this commission in 1798 defined the St Croix, saying that its\r\nmouth was in Passamaquoddy bay and that the boundary ran up this river\r\nand the Cheputnatecook to a marked monument. The treaty of Ghent in 1814\r\n(Article IV.) referred the question of the ownership of the islands in\r\nPassamaquoddy bay to a commission which gave Moose, Dudley and Frederick\r\nislands to the United States; and the same treaty by Article V. provided\r\nfor the survey (which was made in 1817-1818) of a part of the disputed\r\nterritory, and for a general commission. The general commissioners met\r\nat St Andrews, N.B., in 1816, and in New York City in 1822, only to\r\ndisagree; and when the king of the Netherlands, chosen as arbitrator in\r\n1829 (under the Convention of 1827) rendered in 1831 a decision against\r\nwhich the state of Maine protested, the Federal Senate withheld its\r\nassent to his decision. In 1838-1839 the territory in dispute between\r\nNew Brunswick and Maine became the scene of a border \"war,\" known as the\r\n\"Aroostook disturbance\"; Maine erected forts along the line she claimed,\r\nCongress authorized the president to resist any attempt of Great Britain\r\nto enforce exclusive jurisdiction over the disputed territory, and an\r\narmed conflict seemed imminent. General Winfield Scott was sent to take\r\ncommand on the Maine frontier, and on the 21st of March 1839 he arranged\r\na truce and a joint occupancy of the territory in dispute until a\r\nsatisfactory settlement should be reached by the United States and Great\r\nBritain. The Webster-Ashburton treaty of 1842 was a compromise, which\r\nallowed Maine about 5500 sq. m. less than she had claimed and allowed\r\nGreat Britain about as much less than her claim; all grants of land\r\npreviously made by either party within the limits of the territory which\r\nby this treaty fell within the dominions of the other party were to be\r\n\"held valid, ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession under\r\nsuch grants, to the same extent as if such territory had ... fallen\r\nwithin the dominions of the party by whom such grants were made\"; and\r\nthe government of the United States agreed to pay to Maine and\r\nMassachusetts[7] \"in equal moieties\" the sum of $300,000 as\r\ncompensation for the lands which they had claimed and which under the\r\ntreaty they were called upon to surrender. The long controversy, which\r\nis known in American history as \"The North-East boundary dispute,\" was\r\nnot finally settled however until 1910.\r\n\r\nIt was the Democratic majority in the district of Maine that effected\r\nthe separation from Massachusetts, and from the date of that separation\r\nuntil 1853 Maine was classed as a Democratic state, although it elected\r\na Whig governor in 1838 and in 1840, and cast its electoral vote for\r\nJohn Quincy Adams in 1824 and 1828 and for W. H. Harrison in 1840. As a\r\nresult of the slavery question, there was a party disintegration between\r\n1850 and 1855, followed by the supremacy of the Republican party from\r\n1856 to 1878. In 1878, of the 126,169 votes cast in the election for\r\ngovernor, Selden Connor (b. 1839), re-nominated by the Republicans,\r\nreceived 56,554; Joseph L. Smith (\"National\" or \"Greenback\"), 41,371;\r\nAlonzo Garcelon (1813-1906) (Democratic), 28,218; as no candidate\r\nreceived a majority of the votes, the election was left to the\r\nlegislature.[8] The vote of the House eliminated Connor, and Garcelon\r\nwas chosen in the Senate by a Democratic-National fusion. Again there\r\nwas no election by popular vote in 1879, and Garcelon and his council,\r\nto secure the election of a fusion government, counted-in a fusion\r\nmajority in the legislature by evident falsification of the returns. On\r\nthe 3rd of January 1880 the Supreme Court declared the governor and\r\ncouncil in error in counting in a fusion majority, but on the 7th the\r\ngovernor swore in a legislature with 78 fusion and only two Republican\r\nmembers, and, the governor's term having expired, the president of the\r\nSenate, James D. Lamson, became governor, ex-officio. On the 12th the\r\nlegislative chambers were seized by the Republicans, whose organized\r\nlegislature was declared legal by the Supreme Court, and who chose as\r\ngovernor Daniel Franklin Davis (1843-1897); whereupon, on the 17th,\r\nJoshua L. Chamberlain, to whom the peaceful solution of the difficulty\r\nhad largely been due, retired from the task assigned him by Garcelon on\r\nthe 5th of January \"to protect the public property and institutions of\r\nthe state\" until Garcelon's successor should be duly qualified. In 1880\r\nthe Democrats and Greenbacks united and elected their candidate, but\r\nafter 1883 Maine was strongly Republican until 1910.\r\n\r\n  The governors of the state have been as follows:--\r\n\r\n    William King                        Democrat        1820\r\n    William Durkee Williamson (acting)     \"            1821\r\n    Benjamin Ames (acting)                 \"            1821\r\n    Albion Keith Parris                    \"            1822\r\n    Enoch Lincoln                          \"            1827\r\n    Nathan Cutler (acting)                 \"            1829\r\n    Jonathan G.

Thus we have a general \"upland surface,\" above\r\n    which the mountain remnants tower, and below which the rivers have\r\n    been entrenched.\r\n\r\n  [2] This name is applied to a chain of lakes (the Rangeley, or\r\n    Oquossoc, the Cupsuptic, the Mooselookmeguntic, the Molechunkamunk or\r\n    Upper Richardson, the Welokenebacook or Lower Richardson, and the\r\n    Umbagog) in Franklin and Oxford counties, in the western part of the\r\n    state; the Umbagog extends into New Hampshire and its outlet helps to\r\n    form the Androscoggin River. These lakes are connected by straits,\r\n    have a total area of between 80 and 90 sq. m., and are from 1200 to\r\n    1500 ft. above the sea. They are sometimes called the Androscoggin\r\n    Lakes.\r\n\r\n  [3] The census of 1905 was taken under the direction of the United\r\n    States census bureau, but the statistics for hand trades were\r\n    omitted.\r\n\r\n  [4] According to previous censuses the population was as follows:\r\n    (1790) 96,540; (1800) 151,719; (1810) 228,705; (1820) 298,335; (1830)\r\n    399,455; (1840) 501,793; (1850) 583,169; (1860) 628,279; (1870)\r\n    626,915.\r\n\r\n  [5] An unincorporated township containing less than 200 inhabitants\r\n    may, on the application of three resident voters, be organized as a\r\n    plantation, but does not pay state or county taxes unless by special\r\n    legislative order. Other unincorporated districts, especially islands\r\n    along the coast, are called \"grants,\" \"surpluses,\" \"gores\" or\r\n    \"tracts.\"\r\n\r\n  [6] By this charter, issued in 1578, Sir Humphrey Gilbert was\r\n    entitled to all territory lying within two hundred leagues of any\r\n    colony that he might plant within six years; although it had long\r\n    since lapsed, Raleigh Gilbert seems not to have been aware of it.\r\n\r\n  [7] An article in the Act relating to the separation of Maine from\r\n    Massachusetts stipulated that the lands within the District of Maine\r\n    which prior to the separation had belonged to Massachusetts should\r\n    after the separation belong one-half to Maine and one-half to\r\n    Massachusetts. In 1826 the wild lands of Maine were surveyed and\r\n    divided between the two states; and in 1853 Maine acquired from\r\n    Massachusetts, for $362,500, all of this land still remaining in\r\n    possession of the latter state.\r\n\r\n  [8] According to Art. V. of the constitution a majority of the total\r\n    number of votes cast was required for election; in case no candidate\r\n    should receive a majority, it was prescribed that the \"House of\r\n    Representatives shall, by ballot, from the persons having the four\r\n    highest numbers of votes on the lists, if so many there be, elect two\r\n    persons and make returns of their names to the Senate, of whom the\r\n    Senate shall, by ballot, elect one, who shall be declared the\r\n    governor.\" An amendment, which became a part of the constitution on\r\n    the 9th of November 1880, provided that a plurality of the total\r\n    number of votes cast should be sufficient for election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINE DE BIRAN, FRANÇOIS-PIERRE-GONTHIER (1766-1824), French\r\nphilosopher, was born at Bergerac, on the 29th of November, 1766. The\r\nname Maine he assumed (some time before 1787) from an estate called Le\r\nMaine, near Mouleydier. After studying with distinction under the\r\n_doctrinaires_ of Périgueux, he entered the life-guards of Louis XVI.,\r\nand was present at Versailles on the memorable 5th and 6th of October\r\n1789. On the breaking up of the _gardes du corps_ Biran retired to his\r\npatrimonial inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where his retired\r\nlife preserved him from the horrors of the Revolution. It was at this\r\nperiod that, to use his own words, he \"passed _per saltum_ from\r\nfrivolity to philosophy.\" He began with psychology, which he made the\r\nstudy of his life. After the Reign of Terror Maine de Biran took part in\r\npolitical affairs. Having been excluded from the council of the Five\r\nHundred on suspicion of royalism, he took part with his friend Laîné in\r\nthe commission of 1813, which gave expression for the first time to\r\ndirect opposition to the will of the emperor. After the Restoration he\r\nheld the office of treasurer to the chamber of deputies, and habitually\r\nretired during the autumn recess to his native district to pursue his\r\nfavourite study. He died on the 20th (16th, or 23rd, according to\r\nothers) of July 1824.\r\n\r\nMaine de Biran's philosophical reputation has suffered from two\r\ncauses--his obscure and laboured style, and the fact that only a few,\r\nand these the least characteristic, of his writings appeared during his\r\nlifetime. These consisted of the essay on habit (_Sur l'influence de\r\nl'habitude_, 1803), a critical review of P. Laromiguière's lectures\r\n(1817), and the philosophical portion of the article \"Leibnitz\" in the\r\n_Biographie universelle_ (1819). A treatise on the analysis of thought\r\n(_Sur la décomposition de la pensée_), although sent to press, was never\r\nprinted. In 1834 these writings, together with the essay entitled\r\n_Nouvelles considérations sur les rapports du physique et du moral de\r\nl'homme_, were published by Victor Cousin, who in 1841 added three\r\nvolumes, under the title _Oeuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran_. But\r\nthe publication (in 1859) by E. Naville (from MSS. placed at his\r\nfather's disposal by Biran's son) of the _Oeuvres inédites de Maine de\r\nBiran_, in three volumes, first rendered possible a connected view of\r\nhis philosophical development. At first a sensualist, like Condillac and\r\nLocke, next an intellectualist, he finally shows himself a mystical\r\ntheosophist. The _Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie_\r\nrepresents the second or completest stage of his philosophy, the\r\nfragments of the _Nouveaux essais d'anthropologie_ the third.\r\n\r\n  Maine de Biran's first essays in philosophy were written avowedly from\r\n  the point of view of Locke and Condillac, but even in them he was\r\n  brought to signalize the essential fact on which his later speculation\r\n  turns. Dealing with the formation of habits, he is compelled to note\r\n  that passive impressions, however transformed, do not furnish a\r\n  complete or adequate explanation. With Laromiguière he distinguishes\r\n  attention as an active effort, of no less importance than the passive\r\n  receptivity of sense, and with Butler distinguishes passively formed\r\n  customs from active habits. He finally arrived at the conclusion that\r\n  Condillac's notion of passive receptivity as the one source of\r\n  conscious experience was not only an error in fact but an error of\r\n  method--in short, that the mechanical mode of viewing consciousness as\r\n  formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive. For it he\r\n  proposed to substitute the genetic method, whereby human conscious\r\n  experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its\r\n  essential basis in connexion with external conditions. The essential\r\n  basis he finds in the real consciousness, of self as an active\r\n  striving power, and the stages of its development, corresponding to\r\n  what one may call the relative importance of the external conditions\r\n  and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness he designates as\r\n  the affective, the perceptive and the reflective. In connexion with\r\n  this Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing\r\n  with conscious experience, such as the mode by which the organism is\r\n  cognized, the mode by which the organism is distinguished from\r\n  extra-organic things, and the nature of those general ideas by which\r\n  the relations of things are known to us--cause, power, force, &c.\r\n\r\n  In the latest stage of his speculation Biran distinguishes the animal\r\n  existence from the human, under which the three forms above noted are\r\n  classed, and both from the life of the spirit, in which human thought\r\n  is brought into relation with the supersensible, divine system of\r\n  things. This stage is left imperfect. Altogether Biran's work presents\r\n  a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by\r\n  preference to the psychological aspect of experience.\r\n\r\n  The _Oeuvres inédites_ of Maine de Biran by E. Naville contain an\r\n  introductory study; in 1887 appeared _Science et psychologie:\r\n  nouvelles oeuvres inédites_, with introduction by A. Bertrand. See\r\n  also O.

Area, 2786 sq. m. Pop.\r\n(1906), 513,490. Maine-et-Loire is made up of two distinct regions, the\r\nline of demarcation running roughly from north to south along the valley\r\nof the Sarthe, then turning south-west and passing Brissac and Doué;\r\nthat to the west consists of granites, felspars, and a continuation of\r\nthe geological formations of Brittany and Vendée; to the east, schists,\r\nlimestone and chalk prevail. The department is traversed from east to\r\nwest by the majestic valley of the Loire, with its rich orchards,\r\nnurseries and market-gardens. The highest altitudes are found in the\r\nsouth-west, where north-east of Cholet one eminence reaches 689 ft.\r\nElsewhere the surface is low and undulating in character. The department\r\nbelongs entirely to the basin of the Loire, the bed of which is wide but\r\nshallow, and full of islands, the depth of the water in summer being at\r\nsome places little more than 2 ft. Floods are sudden and destructive.\r\nThe chief affluent of the Loire within the department is the Maine,\r\nformed a little above Angers by the junction of the Mayenne and the\r\nSarthe, the latter having previously received the waters of the Loire.\r\nAll three are navigable. Other tributaries of the Loire are the Thouet\r\n(with its tributary the Dive), the Layon, the Evre, and the Divatte on\r\nthe left, and the Authion on the right. The Mayenne is joined on the\r\nright by the Oudon, which can be navigated below Segré. The Erdre, which\r\njoins the Loire at Nantes, and the Moine, a tributary of the\r\nSèvre-Nantaise, both rise within this department. The climate is very\r\nmild. The mean annual temperature of Angers is about 53°, slightly\r\nexceeding that of Paris; the rainfall (between 23 and 24 in. annually)\r\nis distinctly lower than that of the rest of France. Notwithstanding\r\nthis deficiency, the frequent fogs, combined with the peculiar nature of\r\nthe soil in the south-east of the department, produce a degree of\r\nmoisture which is highly favourable to meadow growths. The winter colds\r\nare never severe, and readily permit the cultivation of certain trees\r\nwhich cannot be reared in the adjoining departments.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the department is very prosperous. The produce of\r\ncereals, chiefly wheat, oats and barley, is in excess of its needs, and\r\npotatoes and mangels also give good returns. Extensive areas in the\r\nvalley of the Loire are under hemp, and the vegetables, melons and other\r\nfruits of that region are of the finest quality. Good wine is produced\r\nat Serrant and other places near Angers, and on the right bank of the\r\nLayon and near Saumur, the sparkling white wine of which is a rival of\r\nthe cheaper brands of champagne. Cider is also produced, and the\r\ncultivation of fruit is general. Forests and woodland in which oak and\r\nbeech are the chief trees cover large tracts. The fattening of cattle is\r\nan important industry round Cholet, and horses much used for light\r\ncavalry are reared. Several thousand workmen are employed in the slate\r\nquarries in the vicinity of Angers, tufa is worked in the river valleys,\r\nand freestone and other stone, mispickel, iron and coal are also found.\r\nCholet, the chief industrial town, and its district manufacture\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, as well as linen cloths, flannels, cotton goods,\r\nand hempen and other coarse fabrics, and similar industries are carried\r\non at Angers, which also manufactures liqueurs, rope, boots and shoes\r\nand parasols. Saumur, besides its production of wine, makes beads and\r\nenamels. The commerce of Maine-et-Loire comprises the exportation of\r\nlive stock and of the various products of its soil and industries, and\r\nthe importation of hemp, cotton, and other raw materials. The department\r\nis served by the railways of the state and the Orléans and Western\r\ncompanies. The Mayenne, the Sarthe and the Loir, together with some of\r\nthe lesser rivers, provide about 130 m. of navigable waterway. In the\r\nsouth-east the canal of the Dive covers some 10 m. in the department.\r\n\r\nThere are five arrondissements--Angers, Baugé, Cholet, Saumur and Segré,\r\nwith 34 cantons and 381 communes. Maine-et-Loire belongs to the académie\r\n(educational division) of Rennes, to the region of the VIII. army corps,\r\nand to the ecclesiastical province of Tours. Angers (q.v.), the capital,\r\nis the seat of a bishopric and of a court of appeal. Other principal\r\nplaces are Cholet, Saumur, and Fontevrault, which receive separate\r\ntreatment. For architectural interest there may also be mentioned the\r\nchâteaux of Brissac (17th century), Serrant (15th and 16th centuries),\r\nMontreuil-Bellay (14th and 15th centuries), and Ecuillé (15th century),\r\nand the churches of Puy-Notre-Dame (13th century) and St\r\nFlorent-le-Vieil (13th, 17th, and 19th centuries), the last containing\r\nthe fine monument to Charles Bonchamps, the Vendean leader, by David\r\nd'Angers. Gennes has remains of a theatre and other ruins of the Roman\r\nperiod, as well as two churches dating in part from the 10th century.\r\nPonts-de-Cé, an interesting old town built partly on islands in the\r\nLoire, is historically important, because till the Revolution its\r\nbridges formed the only way across the Loire between Saumur and Nantes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINPURI, or MYNPOOREE, a town and district of British India, in the\r\nAgra division of the United Provinces. The town has a station on a\r\nbranch of the East Indian railway recently opened from Shikohabad. Pop.\r\n(1901), 19,000. It consists of two separate portions, Mainpuri proper\r\nand Mukhamganj. Holkar plundered and burned part of the town in 1804,\r\nbut was repulsed by the local militia. Since the British occupation the\r\npopulation has rapidly increased and many improvements have been carried\r\nout. The Agra branch of the Grand Trunk road runs through the town,\r\nforming a wide street lined on both sides by shops, which constitute the\r\nprincipal bazaar. Mainpuri has a speciality in the production of carved\r\nwooden articles inlaid with brass wire. The American Presbyterian\r\nmission manages a high school.\r\n\r\nThe DISTRICT OF MAINPURI lies in the central Doab. Area, 1675 sq. m.\r\nPop. (1901), 829,357, an increase of 8.8% in the decade. It consists of\r\nan almost unbroken plain, intersected by small rivers, with a few\r\nundulating sand ridges. It is wooded throughout with mango groves, and\r\nisolated clumps of _bábul_ trees occasionally relieve the bareness of\r\nits saline _usar_ plains. On the south-western boundary the Jumna flows\r\nin a deep alluvial bed, sometimes sweeping close to the high banks which\r\noverhang its valley, and elsewhere leaving room for a narrow strip of\r\nfertile soil between the river and the upland plain. From the low-lying\r\nlands thus formed a belt of ravines stretches inland for some 2 m.,\r\noften covered with jungle, but affording good pasturage for cattle. The\r\ndistrict is watered by two branches of the Ganges canal, and is\r\ntraversed by the main line of the East Indian railway.\r\n\r\n  Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj, and\r\n  after the fall of that famous state it was divided into a number of\r\n  petty principalities, of which Rapri and Bhongaon were the chief. In\r\n  1194 Rapri was made the seat of a Moslem governor. Mainpuri fell to\r\n  the Moguls on Baber's invasion in 1526, and, although temporarily\r\n  wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of Shere Shah, was\r\n  again occupied by them on the reinstatement of Humayun after the\r\n  victory of Panipat. Like the rest of the lower Doab, Mainpuri passed,\r\n  towards the end of the 18th century, into the power of the Mahrattas,\r\n  and finally became a portion of the province of Oudh. When this part\r\n  of the country was ceded to the British, in 1801, Mainpuri town became\r\n  the headquarters of the extensive district of Etawah, which was in\r\n  1856 reduced by the formation of Etah and Mainpuri into separate\r\n  collectorates. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857 the regiment\r\n  stationed at Mainpuri revolted and attacked the town, which was\r\n  successfully defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week,\r\n  until the arrival of the Jhansi mutineers made it necessary to abandon\r\n  the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE (Fr. _maintenance_, from _maintenir_, to maintain, support,\r\nLat. _manu tenere_, to hold in the hand). The action of giving support,\r\nsupplying means of subsistence, keeping efficient or in working order.\r\nIn English law maintenance is an officious intermeddling in an action\r\nthat in no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting either party,\r\nwith money or otherwise, to prosecute or defend it. It is an indictable\r\noffence, both at common law and by statute, and punishable by fine and\r\nimprisonment. It invalidates all contracts involving it. It is also\r\nactionable. There are, however, certain cases in which maintenance is\r\njustifiable, e.g. any one who has an interest, even if it be only\r\ncontingent, in the matter at variance can maintain another in an action\r\nconcerning the matter; or several parties who have a common interest in\r\nthe same thing may maintain one another in a suit concerning the same.\r\nNeither is it reckoned maintenance to assist another in his suit on\r\ncharitable grounds, or for a master to assist his servant, or a parent\r\nhis son, or a husband his wife. The law with regard to the subject is\r\nconsidered at length in _Bradlaugh_ v. _Newdegate_, 1883, 11 Q.B.D. 1.\r\nSee also CHAMPERTY. For the practice of \"livery and maintenance\" see\r\nENGLISH HISTORY, §§ v. and vi.\r\n\r\n  A CAP OF MAINTENANCE, i.e. a cap of crimson velvet turned up with\r\n  ermine, is borne, as one of the insignia of the British sovereign,\r\n  immediately before him at his coronation or on such state occasions as\r\n  the opening of parliament. It is carried by the hereditary bearer, the\r\n  marquess of Winchester, upon a white wand. A similar cap is also borne\r\n  before the lord mayor of London. The origin of this symbol of dignity\r\n  is obscure. It is stated in the _New English Dictionary_ that it was\r\n  granted by the pope to Henry VII. and Henry VIII. It is probably\r\n  connected with the \"cap of estate\" or \"dignity,\" sometimes also styled\r\n  \"cap of maintenance,\" similar to the royal symbol with two peaks or\r\n  horns behind, which is borne as a heraldic charge by certain families.\r\n  It seems originally to have been a privilege of dukes. Where it is\r\n  used the crest is placed upon it, instead of on the usual wreath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENON, FRANÇOISE D'AUBIGNÉ, MARQUISE DE (1635-1719), the second wife\r\nof Louis XIV., was born in a prison at Niort, on the 27th of November\r\n1635. Her father, Constant d'Aubigné, was the son of Agrippa d'Aubigné,\r\nthe famous friend and general of Henry IV., and had been imprisoned as a\r\nHuguenot malcontent, but her mother, a fervent Catholic, had the child\r\nbaptized in her religion, her sponsors being the duc de la\r\nRochefoucauld, father of the author of the _Maxims_, and the comtesse de\r\nNeuillant. In 1639 Constant d'Aubigné was released from prison and took\r\nall his family with him to Martinique, where he died in 1645, after\r\nhaving lost what fortune remained to him at cards. Mme d'Aubigné\r\nreturned to France, and from sheer poverty unwillingly yielded her\r\ndaughter to her sister-in-law, Mme de Villette, who made the child very\r\nhappy, but converted or pretended to convert her to Protestantism. When\r\nthis was known an order of state was issued that she should be entrusted\r\nto Mme de Neuillant, her godmother. Every means was now used to convert\r\nher back to Catholicism, but at the last she only yielded on the\r\ncondition that she need not believe that the soul of Mme de Villette was\r\nlost. Once reconverted, she was neglected and sent home to live with her\r\nmother, who had only a small pension of 200 livres a year, which ceased\r\non her death in 1650. The chevalier de Meré, a man of some literary\r\ndistinction, who had made her acquaintance at Mme de Neuillant's,\r\ndiscovered her penniless condition, and introduced his \"young Indian,\"\r\nas he called her, to Scarron, the famous wit and comic writer, at whose\r\nhouse all the literary society of the day assembled. Scarron took a\r\nfancy to the friendless girl, and offered either to pay for her\r\nadmission to a convent, or, though he was deformed and an invalid, to\r\nmarry her himself. She accepted his offer of marriage, and became Mme\r\nScarron in 1651. For nine years she was not only his most faithful\r\nnurse, but an attraction to his house, where she tried to bridle the\r\nlicence of the conversation of the time. On the death of Scarron, in\r\n1660, Anne of Austria continued his pension to his widow, and even\r\nincreased it to 2000 livres a year, which enabled her to entertain and\r\nfrequent the literary society her husband had made her acquainted with;\r\nbut on the queen-mother's death in 1666 the king refused to continue her\r\npension, and she prepared to leave Paris for Lisbon as lady attendant to\r\nthe queen of Portugal. But before she started she met Mme de Montespan,\r\nwho was already, though not avowedly, the king's mistress, and who took\r\nsuch a fancy to her that she obtained the continuance of her pension,\r\nwhich put off for ever the question of going to Portugal. Mme de\r\nMontespan did yet more for her, for when, in 1669, her first child by\r\nthe king was born, Mme Scarron was established with a large income and a\r\nlarge staff of servants at Vaugirard to bring up the king's children in\r\nsecrecy as they were born. In 1674 the king determined to have his\r\nchildren at court, and their governess, who had now made sufficient\r\nfortune to buy the estate of Maintenon, accompanied them. The king had\r\nnow many opportunities of seeing Mme Scarron, and, though at first he\r\nwas prejudiced against her, her even temper contrasted so advantageously\r\nwith the storms of passion and jealousy exhibited by Mme de Montespan,\r\nthat she grew steadily in his favour, and had in 1678 the gratification\r\nof having her estate at Maintenon raised to a marquisate and herself\r\nentitled Mme de Maintenon by the king. Such favours brought down the\r\nfury of Mme de Montespan's jealousy, and Mme de Maintenon's position was\r\nalmost unendurable, until, in 1680, the king severed their connexion by\r\nmaking the latter second lady in waiting to the dauphiness, and soon\r\nafter Mme de Montespan left the court. The new _amie_ used her influence\r\non the side of decency, and the queen openly declared she had never been\r\nso well treated as at this time, and eventually died in Mme de\r\nMaintenon's arms in 1683. The queen's death opened the way to yet\r\ngreater advancement; in 1684 Mme de Maintenon was made first lady in\r\nwaiting to the dauphiness, and in the winter of 1685-1686 she was\r\nprivately married to the king by Harlay, archbishop of Paris, in the\r\npresence, it is believed, of Père la Chaise, the king's confessor, the\r\nmarquis de Montchevreuil, the chevalier de Forbin, and Bontemps. No\r\nwritten proof of the marriage is extant, but that it took place is\r\nnevertheless certain. Her life during the next thirty years can be fully\r\nstudied in her letters, of which many authentic examples are extant. As\r\na wife she was wholly admirable; she had to entertain a man who would\r\nnot be amused, and had to submit to that terribly strict court etiquette\r\nof absolute obedience to the king's inclination, which Saint-Simon so\r\nvividly describes, and yet be always cheerful and never complain of\r\nweariness or ill-health. Her political influence has probably been\r\nexaggerated, but it was supreme in matters of detail. The ministers of\r\nthe day used to discuss and arrange all the business to be done with the\r\nking beforehand with her, and it was all done in her cabinet and in her\r\npresence, but the king in more important matters often chose not to\r\nconsult her. Such mistakes as, for instance, the replacing of Catinat by\r\nVilleroi may be attributed to her, but not whole policies--notably,\r\naccording to Saint-Simon, not the policy with regard to the Spanish\r\nsuccession. Even the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the\r\ndragonnades have been laid to her charge, but recent investigations have\r\ntended to show that in spite of ardent Catholicism, she at least\r\nopposed, if not very vigorously, the cruelties of the dragonnades,\r\nalthough she was pleased with the conversions they procured. She was\r\napparently afraid to imperil her great reputation for devotion, which\r\nhad in 1692 obtained for her from Innocent XII. the right of visitation\r\nover all the convents in France. Where she deserves blame is in her use\r\nof her power for personal patronage, as in compassing the promotions of\r\nChamillart and Villeroi, and the frequent assistance given to her\r\nbrother Comte Charles d'Aubigné. Her influence was on the whole a\r\nmoderating and prudent force. Her social influence was not as great as\r\nit might have been, owing to her holding no recognized position at\r\ncourt, but it was always exercised on the side of decency and morality,\r\nand it must not be forgotten that from her former life she was intimate\r\nwith the literary people of the day. Side by side with this public life,\r\nwhich wearied her with its shadowy power, occasionally crossed by a\r\ndesire to be recognised as queen, she passed a nobler and sweeter\r\nprivate existence as the foundress of St Cyr. Mme de Maintenon was a\r\nborn teacher; she had so won the hearts of her first pupils that they\r\npreferred her to their own mother, and was similarly successful later\r\nwith the young and impetuous duchess of Burgundy, and she had always\r\nwished to establish a home for poor girls of good family placed in such\r\nstraits as she herself had experienced. As soon as her fortunes began to\r\nmend she started a small home for poor girls at Ruel, which she\r\nafterwards moved to Noisy, and which was the nucleus of the splendid\r\ninstitution of St Cyr, which the king endowed in 1686, at her request,\r\nout of the funds of the Abbey of St Denis. She was in her element there.\r\nShe herself drew up the rules of the institution; she examined every\r\nminute detail; she befriended her pupils in every way; and her heart\r\noften turned from the weariness of Versailles or of Marly to her \"little\r\ngirls\" at St Cyr. It was for them that Racine wrote his _Esther_ and his\r\n_Athalie_, and it was because he managed the affairs of St Cyr well that\r\nMichel Chamillart became controller-general of the finances. The later\r\nyears of her power were marked by the promotion of her old pupils, the\r\nchildren of the king and Mme de Montespan, to high dignity between the\r\nblood royal and the peers of the realm, and it was doubtless under the\r\ninfluence of her dislike for the duke of Orleans that the king drew up\r\nhis will, leaving the personal care of his successor to the duke of\r\nMaine, and hampering the duke of Orleans by a council of regency. On or\r\neven before her husband's death she retired to St Cyr, and had the\r\nchagrin of seeing all her plans for the advancement of the duke of Maine\r\noverthrown by means of the parliament of Paris. However, the regent\r\nOrleans in no way molested her, but, on the contrary, visited her at St\r\nCyr and continued her pension of 48,000 livres. She spent her last years\r\nat St Cyr in perfect seclusion, but an object of great interest to all\r\nvisitors to France, who, however, with the exception of Peter the Great,\r\nfound it impossible to get an audience with her. On the 15th of April\r\n1719 she died, and was buried in the choir at St Cyr, bequeathing her\r\nestate at Maintenon to her niece, the only daughter of her brother\r\nCharles and wife of the maréchal de Noailles, to whose family it still\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\n  L. A. la Beaumelle published the _Lettres de Madame de Maintenon_, but\r\n  much garbled, in 2 vols. in 1752, and on a larger scale in 9 vols. in\r\n  1756. He also, in 1755, published _Mémoires de Madame de Maintenon_,\r\n  in 6 vols., which caused him to be imprisoned in the Bastille. All\r\n  earlier biographies were superseded by Théophile Lavallée's _Histoire\r\n  de St Cyr_, reviewed in _Causeries du lundi_, vol. viii., and by his\r\n  edition of her _Lettres historiques et édifiantes_, &c., in 7 vols.\r\n  and of her _Correspondance générale_, in 4 vols.

Mayence) a city, episcopal see and fortress of Germany,\r\nsituated on the left bank of the Rhine, almost opposite the influx of\r\nthe Main, at the junction of the important main lines of railway from\r\nCologne to Mannheim and Frankfort-on-Main, 25 m. W. of the latter. Pop.\r\n(1905), 91,124 (including a garrison of 7500 men), of whom two-thirds\r\nare Roman Catholic. The Rhine, which here attains the greatest breadth\r\nof its upper course, is crossed by a magnificent bridge of five arches,\r\nleading to the opposite town of Castel and by two railway bridges. The\r\nold fortifications have recently been pushed farther back, and their\r\nplace occupied by pleasant boulevards. The river front has been\r\nconverted into a fine promenade, commanding extensive views of the\r\nTaunus range of mountains, and the \"Rheingau,\" the most favoured wine\r\ndistrict of Germany. Alongside the quay are the landing-places of the\r\nsteamboats navigating the Rhine. The railway, which formerly incommoded\r\nthe bank, has been diverted, and now, following the ceinture of the new\r\nline of inner fortifications, runs into a central station lying to the\r\nsouth of the city. The interior of the old town consists chiefly of\r\nnarrow and irregular streets, with many quaint and picturesque houses.\r\nThe principal street of the new town is the Kaiserstrasse, leading from\r\nthe railway station to the river.\r\n\r\nThe first object of historical and architectural interest in Mainz is\r\nthe grand old cathedral, an imposing Romanesque edifice with numerous\r\nGothic additions and details (for plan, &c. see ARCHITECTURE:\r\n_Romanesque and Gothic in Germany_). It was originally erected between\r\n975 and 1009, but has since been repeatedly burned down and rebuilt, and\r\nin its present form dates chiefly from the 12th, 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies. The largest of its six towers is 300 ft. high. The whole\r\nbuilding was restored by order of Napoleon in 1814, and another thorough\r\nrenovation was made more recently. The interior contains the tombs of\r\nBoniface, the first archbishop of Mainz, of Frauenlob, the Minnesinger,\r\nand of many of the electors. Mainz possesses nine other Roman Catholic\r\nchurches, the most noteworthy of which are those of St Ignatius, with a\r\nfinely painted ceiling, of St Stephen, built 1257-1328, and restored\r\nafter an explosion in 1857, and of St Peter. The old electoral palace\r\n(1627-1678), a large building of red sandstone, now contains a valuable\r\ncollection of Roman and Germanic antiquities, a picture gallery, a\r\nnatural history museum, the Gutenberg Museum, and a library of 220,000\r\nvolumes. Among the other principal buildings are the palace of the grand\r\nduke of Hesse, built in 1731-1739 as a lodge of the Teutonic order, the\r\ntheatre, the arsenal, and the government buildings. A handsome statue of\r\nGutenberg, by Thorwaldsen, was erected at Mainz in 1837. Mainz still\r\nretains many relics of the Roman period, the most important of which is\r\nthe Eigelstein, a monument believed to have been erected by the Roman\r\nlegions in honour of Drusus. It stands within the citadel, which\r\noccupies the site of the Roman castrum. A little to the south-west of\r\nthe town are the remains of a large Roman aqueduct, of which upwards of\r\nsixty pillars are still standing. The educational and scientific\r\ninstitutions of Mainz include an episcopal seminary, two gymnasia and\r\nother schools, a society for literature and art, a musical society, and\r\nan antiquarian society. The university, founded in 1477, was suppressed\r\nby the French in 1798.\r\n\r\nThe site of Mainz would seem to mark it out naturally as a great centre\r\nof trade, but the illiberal rule of the archbishops and its military\r\nimportance seriously hampered its commercial and industrial development,\r\nand prevented it from rivalling its neighbour Frankfort. It is now,\r\nhowever, the chief emporium of the Rhenish wine traffic, and also\r\ncarries on an extensive transit trade in grain, timber, flour,\r\npetroleum, paper and vegetables. The natural facilities for carriage by\r\nwater are supplemented by the extensive railway system. Large new\r\nharbours to the north of the city were opened in 1887. The principal\r\nmanufactures are leather goods, furniture, carriages, chemicals, musical\r\ninstruments and carpets, for the first two of which the city has\r\nattained a wide reputation. Other industries include brewing and\r\nprinting. Mainz is the seat of the administrative and judicial\r\nauthorities of the province of Rhein-Hessen, and also of a Roman\r\nCatholic bishop.\r\n\r\n_History._--Mainz, one of the oldest cities in Germany, was originally a\r\nCeltic settlement. Its strategic importance was early recognized by the\r\nRomans, and about 13 B.C. Drusus, the son-in-law of Augustus, erected a\r\nfortified camp here, to which the _castellum Mattiacorum_ (the modern\r\nCastel) on the opposite bank was afterwards added, the two being\r\nconnected with a bridge at the opening of the Christian era. The Celtic\r\nname became latinized as _Maguntiacum_, or _Moguntiacum_, and a town\r\ngradually arose around the camp, which became the capital of Germania\r\nSuperior. During the Völkerwanderung Mainz suffered severely, being\r\ndestroyed on different occasions by the Alamanni, the Vandals and the\r\nHuns. Christianity seems to have been introduced into the town at a very\r\nearly period, and in the 6th century a new Mainz was founded by Bishop\r\nSidonius. In the middle of the 8th century under Boniface it became an\r\narchbishopric, and to this the primacy of Germany was soon annexed.\r\nCharlemagne, who had a palace in the neighbourhood, gave privileges to\r\nMainz, which rose rapidly in wealth and importance, becoming a free city\r\nin 1118. During the later middle ages it was the seat of several diets,\r\nthat of 1184 being of unusual size and splendour. In 1160 the citizens\r\nrevolted against Archbishop Arnold, and in 1163 the walls of the city\r\nwere pulled down by order of the emperor Frederick I. But these events\r\ndid not retard its progress. In 1244 certain rights of self-government\r\nwere given to the citizens; and in 1254 Mainz was the centre and\r\nmainspring of a powerful league of Rhenish towns. Owing to its\r\ncommercial prosperity it was known as _goldene_ Mainz, and its\r\npopulation is believed to have been as great as it is at the present\r\nday. But soon a decline set in. In 1462 there was warfare between two\r\nrival archbishops, Diether or Dietrich II. of Isenburg (d. 1463) and\r\nAdolph II. of Nassau (d. 1475). The citizens espoused the cause of\r\nDiether, but their city was captured by Adolph; it was then deprived of\r\nits privileges and was made subject to the archbishop. Many of the\r\ninhabitants were driven into exile, and these carried into other lands a\r\nknowledge of the art of printing, which had been invented at Mainz by\r\nJohann Gutenberg in 1450. During the Thirty Years' War Mainz was\r\noccupied by the Swedes in 1631 and by the French in 1644, the\r\nfortifications being strengthened by the former under Gustavus Adolphus;\r\nin 1688 it was captured again by the French, but they were driven out in\r\nthe following year. In 1792 the citizens welcomed the ideas of the\r\nFrench Revolution; they expelled their archbishop, Friedrich Karl Joseph\r\nd'Erthal, and opened their gates to the French troops. Taken and retaken\r\nseveral times during the next few years, Mainz was ceded to France by\r\nthe treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, and again by the Treaty of Lunéville\r\nin 1801. In 1814 it was restored to Germany and in 1816 it was handed\r\nover to the grand duke of Hesse; it remained, however, a fortress of the\r\nGerman confederation and was garrisoned by Prussian and Austrian troops.\r\nSince 1871 it has been a fortress of the German Empire. There were\r\ndisturbances in the city in 1848.\r\n\r\n  See Brühl, _Mainz, geschichtlich, topographisch und malerisch_ (Mainz,\r\n  1829); C. A. Schaab, _Geschichte der Stadt Mainz_ (Mainz, 1841-1845);\r\n  K. Klein, _Mainz und seine Umgebungen_ (1868); C. G.

Beck, _Mainz und sein\r\n  Handel_ (Mainz, 1881).\r\n\r\nThe ARCHBISHOPRIC OF MAINZ, one of the seven electorates of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, became a powerful state during the middle ages and\r\nretained some of its importance until the dissolution of the empire in\r\n1806. Its archbishop was president of the electoral college,\r\narch-chancellor of the empire and primate of Germany. Its origin dates\r\nback to 747, when the city of Mainz was made the seat of an archbishop,\r\nand a succession of able and ambitious prelates, obtaining lands and\r\nprivileges from emperors and others, made of the district under their\r\nrule a strong and vigorous state. Among these men were Hatto I. (d.\r\n913), Siegfried III. of Eppstein (d. 1249), Gerhard of Eppstein (d.\r\n1305), and Albert of Brandenburg (d. 1545), all of whom played important\r\nparts in the history of Germany. There were several violent contests\r\nbetween rivals anxious to secure so splendid a position as the\r\nelectorate, and the pretensions of the archbishops occasionally moved\r\nthe citizens of Mainz to revolt. The lands of the electorate lay around\r\nMainz, and were on both banks of the Rhine; their area at the time of\r\nthe French Revolution was about 3200 sq. m. The last elector was Karl\r\nTheodor von Dalberg. The archbishopric was secularized in 1803, two\r\nyears after the lands on the left bank of the Rhine had been seized by\r\nFrance. Some of those on the right bank of the river were given to\r\nPrussia and to Hesse; others were formed into a grand duchy for Dalberg.\r\nThe archbishopric itself was transferred to Regensburg.\r\n\r\n  For the history of the electorate see the _Scriptores rerum\r\n  moguntiacarum_, edited by G. C. Joannis (Frankfort, 1722-1727);\r\n  Schunk, _Beiträge zur Mainzer Geschichte_ (Frankfort, 1788-1791);\r\n  Hennes, _Die Erzbischöfe von Mainz_ (Mainz, 1879); Ph. Jaffé,\r\n  _Monumenta moguntina_ (Berlin, 1866), and J. F. Böhmer and C.

His own statement that he was born in\r\n1610 has been disproved. He went to Paris to study at the Collège des\r\nGrassins about 1625, in which year he produced his first piece\r\n_Chriséide et Arimand_, followed in 1626 by _Sylvie_, a \"pastoral\r\ntragi-comedy.\" In 1634 appeared his masterpiece, _Sophonisbe_, which\r\nmarks, in its observance of the rules, the beginning of the \"regular\"\r\ntragedies. Mairet was one of the bitterest assailants of Corneille in\r\nthe controversy over _The Cid_. It was perhaps his jealousy of Corneille\r\nthat made him give up writing for the stage. He was appointed in 1648\r\nofficial representative of the Franche-Comté in Paris, but in 1653 he\r\nwas banished by Mazarin. He was subsequently allowed to return, but in\r\n1668 he retired to Besançon, where he died on the 31st of January 1686.\r\nHis other plays include _Silvanire ou la Morte-vive_, published in 1631\r\nwith an elaborate preface on the observance of the unities, _Les\r\nGalanteries du duc d'Orsonne_ (1632), _Virginie_ (1633), _Marc-Antoine_\r\n(1635), and _Le Grand et dernier Solyman_ (1637).\r\n\r\n  See G. Bizos, _Étude sur la vie et les oeuvres de Jean de Mairet_\r\n  (1877). _Sophonisbe_ was edited by K. Vollmöller (Heilbronn, 1888),\r\n  and _Silvanire_ by R. Otto (Bamberg, 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAISTRE, JOSEPH DE (1754-1821), French diplomatist and polemical writer,\r\nwas born at Chambéry on the 1st of April 1754. His family was an ancient\r\nand noble one, enjoying the title of count, and is said to have been of\r\nLanguedocian extraction. The father of Joseph was president of the\r\nsenate of Savoy, and held other important offices. Joseph himself, after\r\nstudying at Turin, received various appointments in the civil service of\r\nSavoy, finally becoming a member of the senate. In 1786 he married\r\nFrançoise de Morand. The invasion and annexation of Savoy by the French\r\nRepublicans made him an exile. He did not take refuge in that part of\r\nthe king of Sardinia's domains which was for the time spared, but betook\r\nhimself to the as yet neutral territory of Lausanne. There, in 1796, he\r\npublished his first important work (he had previously written certain\r\ndiscourses, pamphlets, letters, &c.), _Considérations sur la France_. In\r\nthis he developed his views, which were those of a Legitimist, but a\r\nLegitimist entirely from the religious and Roman Catholic point of view.\r\nThe philosophism of the 18th century was Joseph de Maistre's lifelong\r\nobject of assault.\r\n\r\nAfter the still further losses which, in the year of the publication of\r\nthis book, the French Revolution inflicted on Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel\r\nsummoned Joseph de Maistre to Turin, and he remained there for the brief\r\nspace during which the king retained a remnant of territory on the\r\nmainland. Then he went to the island of Sardinia, and held office at\r\nCagliari. In 1802 he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary at St Petersburg, and journeyed thither the next year.\r\nAlthough his post was no sinecure, its duties were naturally less\r\nengrossing than the official life, with intervals of uneasy exile and\r\ntravelling, which he had hitherto known, and his literary activity was\r\ngreat. He only published a single treatise, on the _Principe générateur\r\ndes Constitutions_; but he wrote his best and most famous works, _Du\r\nPape_, _De L'église gallicane_ and the _Soirées de St Pétersbourg_, the\r\nlast of which was never finished. _Du Pape_, which the second-named book\r\ncompletes, is a treatise in regular form, dealing with the relations of\r\nthe sovereign pontiff to the Church, to temporal sovereigns, to\r\ncivilization generally, and to schismatics, especially Anglicans and the\r\nGreek Church. It is written from the highest possible standpoint of\r\npapal absolutism. The _Soirées de St Pétersbourg_, so far as it is\r\nanything (for the arrangement is somewhat desultory), is a kind of\r\n_théodicée_, dealing with the fortunes of virtue and vice in this world.\r\nIt contains two of De Maistre's most famous pieces, his panegyric on the\r\nexecutioner as the foundation of social order, and his acrimonious, and\r\nin part unfair, but also in part very damaging, attack on Locke. The _Du\r\nPape_ is dated May 1817; on the _Soirées_ the author was still engaged\r\nat his death. Besides these works he wrote an examination of the\r\nphilosophy of Bacon, some letters on the Inquisition (an institution\r\nwhich, as may be guessed from the remarks just noticed about the\r\nexecutioner, was no stumbling-block to him), and, earlier than any of\r\nthese, a translation of Plutarch's \"Essay on the Delay of Divine\r\nJustice,\" with somewhat copious notes. After 1815 he returned to Savoy,\r\nand was appointed to high office, while his _Du Pape_ made a great\r\nsensation. But the world to which he had returned was not altogether in\r\naccordance with his desires. He had domestic troubles; and chagrin of\r\none sort and another is said to have had not a little to do with his\r\ndeath by paralysis on the 26th of February 1821 at Turin. Most of the\r\nworks mentioned were not published till after his death, and it was not\r\ntill 1851 that a collection of _Lettres et opuscules_ appeared, while\r\neven since that time fresh matter has been published.\r\n\r\nJoseph de Maistre was one of the most powerful, and by far the ablest,\r\nof the leaders of the neo-Catholic and anti-revolutionary movement. The\r\nmost remarkable thing about his standpoint is that, layman as he was, it\r\nwas entirely ecclesiastical. Unlike his contemporary Bonald, Joseph de\r\nMaistre regarded the temporal monarchy as an institution of altogether\r\ninferior importance to the spiritual primacy of the pope. He was by no\r\nmeans a political absolutist, except in so far as he regarded obedience\r\nas the first of political virtues, and he seldom loses an opportunity of\r\nstipulating for a tempered monarchy. But the pope's power is not to be\r\ntempered at all, either by councils or by the temporal power or by\r\nnational churches, least of all by private judgment. The peculiarity of\r\nJoseph de Maistre is that he supports his conclusions, or if it be\r\npreferred his paradoxes, by the hardest and heaviest argument. Although\r\na great master of rhetoric, he never makes rhetoric do duty for logic.\r\nEvery now and then it is possible to detect fallacies in him, but for\r\nthe most part he has succeeded in carrying matters back to those\r\nfundamental differences of opinion which hardly admit of argument, and\r\non which men take sides in consequence chiefly of natural bent, and of\r\npredilection for one state of things rather than for another. The\r\nabsolute necessity of order may be said to have been the first principle\r\nof this thinker, who, in more ways than one, will invite comparison with\r\nHobbes. He could not conceive such order without a single visible\r\nauthority, reference to which should settle all dispute. He saw that\r\nthere could be no such temporal head, and in the pope he thought that he\r\nsaw a spiritual substitute. The anarchic tendencies of the Revolution in\r\npolitics and religion were what offended him. It ought to be added that\r\nhe was profoundly and accurately learned in history and philosophy, and\r\nthat the superficial blunders of the 18th-century _philosophes_\r\nirritated him as much as their doctrines. To Voltaire in particular he\r\nshows no mercy.\r\n\r\n  Of the two works named as his masterpieces, _Du Pape_ and the _Soirées\r\n  de St Pétersbourg_, editions are extremely numerous. No complete\r\n  edition of his works appeared till 1884-1887, when one was published\r\n  at Lyons in 14 volumes. This had been preceded, and has been followed,\r\n  by numerous biographies and discussions: C. Barthélemy, _L'Esprit de\r\n  Joseph de Maistre_ (1859); R. de Sézeval, _Joseph de Maistre_ (1865),\r\n  and J. C. Glaser, _Graf Joseph Maistre_ (same year); L. I. Moreau,\r\n  _Joseph de Maistre_ (1879); F. Paulhan, _Joseph de Maistre et sa\r\n  philosophie_ (1893); L. Cogordan, \"Joseph de Maistre\" in the _Grands\r\n  écrivains français_ (1894); F. Descostes, _Joseph de Maistre avant la\r\n  révolution_ (1896), and other works by the same writer; J. Mandoul,\r\n  _Un Homme d'état italien: Joseph de Maistre et la politique de la\r\n  maison de Savoie_ (1900); and E. Grasset, _Joseph de Maistre_ (1901).\r\n       (G. Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAISTRE, XAVIER DE (1763-1852), younger brother of Joseph de Maistre,\r\nwas born at Chambéry in October 1763. He served when young in the\r\nPiedmontese army, and wrote his delightful fantasy, _Voyage autour de ma\r\nchambre_ (published 1794) when he was under arrest at Turin in\r\nconsequence of a duel. Xavier shared the politics and the loyalty of his\r\nbrother, and on the annexation of Savoy to France, he left the service,\r\nand took a commission in the Russian army. He served under Suvarov in\r\nhis victorious Austro-Russian campaign and accompanied the marshal to\r\nRussia. He shared the disgrace of his general, and supported himself for\r\nsome time in St Petersburg by miniature painting. But on his brother's\r\narrival in St Petersburg he was introduced to the minister of marine. He\r\nwas appointed to several posts in the capital, but also saw active\r\nservice, was wounded in the Caucasus, and attained the rank of\r\nmajor-general. He married a Russian lady and established himself in his\r\nadopted country, even after the overthrow of Napoleon, and the\r\nconsequent restoration of the Piedmontese dynasty. For a time, however,\r\nhe lived at Naples, but he returned to St Petersburg and died there on\r\nthe 12th of June 1852. He was only once in Paris (in 1839), when\r\nSainte-Beuve, who has left some pleasant reminiscences of him, met him.\r\nBesides the _Voyage_ already mentioned, Xavier de Maistre's works (all\r\nof which are of very modest dimensions) are _Le Lépreux de la cité\r\nd'Aoste_ (1811), a touching little story of human misfortune; _Les\r\nPrisonniers du Caucase_, a powerful sketch of Russian character, _La\r\nJeune Sibérienne_, and the _Expédition nocturne_, a sequel to the\r\n_Voyage autour de ma chambre_ (1825). His style is of remarkable ease\r\nand purity.\r\n\r\n  His works, with the exception of some brief chemical tractates, are\r\n  included in the collections of Charpentier, Garnier, &c. See\r\n  Sainte-Beuve's _Portraits contemporains_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITLAND, EDWARD (1824-1897), English humanitarian writer, was born at\r\nIpswich on the 27th of October 1824, and was educated at Caius College,\r\nCambridge. The son of Charles David Maitland, perpetual curate of St\r\nJames's Chapel, Brighton, he was intended for the Church, but his\r\nreligious views did not permit him to take holy orders. For some years\r\nhe lived abroad, first in California and then as a commissioner of\r\nCrownlands in Australia. After his return to England in 1857 he took up\r\nan advanced humanitarian position, and claimed to have acquired a new\r\nsense by which he was able to discern the spiritual condition of other\r\npeople. He was associated with Mrs Anna Kingsford (1846-1888), the\r\nlady-doctor and supporter of vegetarianism and anti-vivisectionism, who,\r\nbesides being one of the pioneers of higher education for women, had\r\nbecome a devotee of mystical theosophy; with her he brought out _Keys of\r\nthe Creeds_ (1875), _The Perfect Way: or the Finding of Christ_ (1882),\r\nand founded the Hermetic Society in 1884. After her death he founded the\r\nEsoteric Christian Union in 1891, and wrote her _Life and Letters_\r\n(1896). He died on the 2nd of October 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITLAND, FREDERIC WILLIAM (1850-1906), English jurist and historian,\r\nson of John Gorham Maitland, was born on the 28th of May 1850, and\r\neducated at Eton and Trinity, Cambridge, being bracketed at the head of\r\nthe moral sciences tripos of 1872, and winning a Whewell scholarship\r\nfor international law. He was called to the bar (Lincoln's Inn) in 1876,\r\nand made himself a thoroughly competent equity lawyer and conveyancer,\r\nbut finally devoted himself to comparative jurisprudence and especially\r\nthe history of English law. In 1884 he was appointed reader in English\r\nlaw at Cambridge, and in 1888 became Downing professor of the laws of\r\nEngland. Though handicapped in his later years by delicate health, his\r\nintellectual grasp and wide knowledge and research gradually made him\r\nfamous as a jurist and historian. He edited numerous volumes for the\r\nSelden Society, including _Select Pleas for the Crown, 1200-1225_,\r\n_Select Pleas in Manorial Courts_ and _The Court Baron_; and among his\r\nprincipal works were _Gloucester Pleas_ (1884), _Justice and Police_\r\n(1885), _Bracton's Note-Book_ (1887), _History of English Law_ (with Sir\r\nF. Pollock, 1895; new ed. 1898; see also his article ENGLISH LAW in this\r\nencyclopaedia), _Domesday Book and Beyond_ (1897), _Township and\r\nBorough_ (1898), _Canon Law in England_ (1898), _English Law and the\r\nRenaissance_ (1901), the _Life of Leslie Stephen_ (1906), besides\r\nimportant contributions to the _Cambridge Modern History_, the _English\r\nHistorical Review_, the _Law Quarterly Review_, _Harvard Law Review_ and\r\nother publications. His writings are marked by vigour and vitality of\r\nstyle, as well as by the highest qualities of the historian who\r\nrecreates the past from the original sources; he had no sympathy with\r\neither legal or historical pedantry; and his death at Grand Canary on\r\nthe 19th of December 1906 deprived English law and letters of one of\r\ntheir most scholarly and most inspiring representatives, notable alike\r\nfor sweetness of character, acuteness in criticism, and wisdom in\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n  See P. Vinogradoff's article on Maitland in the _English Historical\r\n  Review_ (1907); Sir F. Pollock's in the _Quarterly Review_ (1907); G.\r\n  T. Lapsley's in _The Green Bag_ (Boston, Mass., 1907); A. L. Smith,\r\n  _F. W. Maitland_ (1908); H. A. L. Fisher, _F. W. Maitland_ (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITLAND, SIR RICHARD (LORD LETHINGTON) (1496-1586), Scottish lawyer,\r\npoet, and collector of Scottish verse, was born in 1496. His father, Sir\r\nWilliam Maitland of Lethington and Thirlestane, fell at Flodden; his\r\nmother was a daughter of George, Lord Seton. He studied law at the\r\nuniversity of St Andrews, and afterwards in Paris. His castle at\r\nLethington was burnt by the English in 1549. He was in 1552 one of the\r\ncommissioners to settle matters with the English about the debateable\r\nlands. About 1561 he seems to have lost his sight, but this did not\r\nrender him incapable of attending to public business, as he was the same\r\nyear admitted an ordinary lord of session with the title of Lord\r\nLethington, and a member of the privy council; and in 1562 he was\r\nappointed keeper of the Great Seal. He resigned this last office in\r\n1567, in favour of John, prior of Coldingham, his second son, but he sat\r\non the bench till he attained his eighty-eighth year. He died on the\r\n20th of March 1586. His eldest son, by his wife Mary Cranstoun of\r\nCrosbie, was William Maitland (q.v.): his second son, John (c.\r\n1545-1595), was a lord of session, and was made a lord of parliament in\r\n1590, with the title of Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, in which he was\r\nsucceeded by his son John, also for some time a lord of session, who was\r\ncreated earl of Lauderdale in 1624. One of Sir Richard's daughters,\r\nMargaret, assisted her father in preparing his collection of old Scots\r\nverse.\r\n\r\nThe poems of Sir Richard Maitland, none of them lengthy, are for the\r\nmost part satirical, and are principally directed against the social and\r\npolitical abuses of his time. He is chiefly remembered as the industrial\r\ncollector and preserver of many pieces of Scots poetry. These were\r\ncopied into two large volumes, one in folio and another in quarto, the\r\nformer written by himself, and the latter by his daughter. After being\r\nin the possession of his descendant the duke of Lauderdale, these\r\nvolumes were purchased at the sale of the duke's library by Samuel\r\nPepys, and have since been preserved in the Pepysian Library, Magdalene\r\nCollege, Cambridge. They lay there unnoticed for many years till Bishop\r\nPercy published one of the poems in his _Reliques of English Poetry_.\r\nSeveral of the prices were then transcribed by John Pinkerton, who\r\nafterwards published them under the title of _Ancient Scottish Poems_ (2\r\nvols., 1786.)\r\n\r\n  For an account of the Maitland Folio MS. see Gregory Smith's\r\n  _Specimens of Middle Scots_, 1902 (p. lxxiii.). The Scottish Text\r\n  Society has undertaken an edition of the entire manuscript. Maitland's\r\n  own poems were reprinted by Sibbald in his _Chronicle of Scottish\r\n  Poetry_ (1802), and in 1830 by the Maitland Club, named after him, and\r\n  founded for the purpose of continuing his efforts to preserve the\r\n  remains of early Scots literature. Sir Richard left in manuscript a\r\n  history of the family of Seton, and a volume of legal decisions\r\n  collected by him between the years 1550 and 1565. Both are preserved\r\n  in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh; the former was published by the\r\n  Maitland Club, in 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITLAND (MAITLAND OF LETHINGTON), WILLIAM (c. 1528-1573), Scottish\r\nstatesman, eldest son of the preceding, was educated at St Andrews. At\r\nan early age he entered public life and began in various ways to serve\r\nthe regent, Mary of Lorraine, becoming her secretary of state in 1558.\r\nIn 1559, however, he deserted her and threw in his lot with the lords of\r\nthe congregation, to whom his knowledge of foreign, and especially of\r\nEnglish, politics and his general ability were assets of the highest\r\nvalue. The lords sent him to England to ask for assistance from\r\nElizabeth, and his constant aim throughout his political career was to\r\nbring about a union between the two crowns. He appears to have feared\r\nthe return of Mary Queen of Scots to Scotland, but after her arrival in\r\n1561 he was appointed secretary of state, and for about six years he\r\ndirected the policy of Scotland and enjoyed the confidence of the queen.\r\nHis principal antagonist was John Knox; there were several tussles\r\nbetween them, the most famous, perhaps, being the one in the general\r\nassembly of 1564, and on the whole Maitland held his own against the\r\npreachers. He was doubtless concerned in the conspiracy against David\r\nRizzio, and after the favourite's murder he was obliged to leave the\r\ncourt and was himself in danger of assassination. In 1567, however, he\r\nwas again at Mary's side. He was a consenting party to the murder of\r\nDarnley, although he had favoured his marriage with Mary, but the enmity\r\nbetween Bothwell and himself was one of the reasons which drove him into\r\nthe arms of the queen's enemies, among whom he figured at Langside. He\r\nwas one of the Scots who met Elizabeth's representatives at York in\r\n1568; here he showed a desire to exculpate Mary and to marry her to the\r\nduke of Norfolk, a course of action probably dictated by a desire to\r\navoid all revelations about the Darnley murder. But this did not prevent\r\nhim from being arrested in September 1569 on account of his share in the\r\ncrime. He was, however, delivered from his captors by a ruse on the part\r\nof his friend, Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and was brought into\r\nEdinburgh Castle, while his trial was put off because the city was\r\nthronged with his adherents. Maitland now became the leader of the\r\nremnant which stood by the cause of the imprisoned queen. Already a\r\nphysical wreck, he was borne into Edinburgh Castle in April 1571 and\r\nwith Kirkcaldy he held this fortress against the regent Morton and his\r\nEnglish auxiliaries. The castle surrendered in May 1573 and on the 7th\r\nor the 9th of June following Maitland died at Leith, there being very\r\nlittle evidence for the theory that he poisoned himself. \"Secretary\r\nMaitland\" was a man of great learning with a ready wit and a caustic\r\ntongue. He was reputed to be the most versatile and accomplished\r\nstatesman of his age, and almost alone among his Scottish contemporaries\r\nhe placed his country above the claims of either the Roman Catholic or\r\nthe Protestant religions. Among the testimonies to his great abilities\r\nare those of Queen Elizabeth, of William Cecil and of Knox. By his\r\nsecond wife, Mary Fleming, one of Queen Mary's ladies, whom he married\r\nin 1567, he had a son and daughter. His son James died without issue\r\nabout 1620.\r\n\r\n  See John Skelton, _Maitland of Lethington_ (1894); A. Lang, _History\r\n  of Scotland_, vol. ii. (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITLAND, EAST and WEST, adjoining municipalities in Northumberland\r\ncounty, New South Wales, Australia, 120 m. by rail N. of Sydney. Pop.\r\n(1901), West Maitland, 6798; East Maitland, 3287. These towns are\r\nsituated in a valley on the Hunter River, which is liable to sudden\r\nfloods, to guard against which the river is protected by stone\r\nembankments at West Maitland, while there are flood-gates at East\r\nMaitland. Maitland is the centre of the rich agricultural district of\r\nthe Hunter Valley, which produces maize, wheat and other cereals,\r\nlucerne, tobacco, fruit and wine; excellent coal also is worked in the\r\nvicinity. East Maitland is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop, whose\r\ncathedral (St John's), however, is situated in the larger town. Besides\r\nthis, West Maitland contains several handsome public and commercial\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAITREYA, the name of the future Buddha. In one of the works included in\r\nthe Pali canon, the _Digha Nikaya_, a prophecy is put into the Buddha's\r\nmouth that after the decay of the religion another Buddha, named\r\nMetteyya, will arise who will have thousands of followers instead of the\r\nhundreds that the historical Buddha had. This is the only mention of the\r\nfuture Buddha in the canon. For some centuries we hear nothing more\r\nabout him. But when, in the period just before and after the Christian\r\nera, some Buddhists began to write in Sanskrit instead of Pali, they\r\ncomposed new works in which Maitreya (the Sanskrit form of Metteyya) is\r\nmore often mentioned, and details are given as to his birthplace and\r\nhistory. These are entirely devised in imitation of the details of the\r\nlife of the historical Buddha, and have no independent value. Only the\r\nnames differ. The document in which the original prophecy occurs was put\r\ntogether at some date during the 1st century after the Buddha's death\r\n(see NIKAYA). It is impossible to say whether tradition was, at that\r\ntime, correct in attributing it to the Buddha. But whoever chose the\r\nname (it is a patronymic or family, not a personal name), had no doubt\r\nregard to the etymological connexion with the word for \"love,\" which is\r\nMetta in Pali. This would only be one of those punning allusions so\r\nfrequent in Indian literature.\r\n\r\nLong afterwards, probably in the 6th or 7th century, a reformer in south\r\nIndia, at a time when the incoming flood of ritualism and superstition\r\nthreatened to overwhelm the simple teaching of the earlier Buddhism,\r\nwrote a Pali poem, entitled the _Anagata Vamsa_. In this he described\r\nthe golden age of the future when, in the time of Metteyya, kings,\r\nministers and people would vie one with the other in the maintenance of\r\nthe original simple doctrine, and in the restoration of the good times\r\nof old. The other side also claimed the authority of the future Buddha\r\nfor their innovations. Statues of Maitreya are found in Buddhist\r\ntemples, of all sects, at the present day; and the belief in his future\r\nadvent is universal among Buddhists.\r\n\r\n  Authorities.--_Digha Nikaya_, vol. iii., edited by J.

It is chiefly\r\nnotable for the defeat inflicted on a British brigade under General\r\nBurrows by Ayub Khan on the 27th of July 1880 during the second Afghan\r\nWar (see AFGHANISTAN). Ayub Khan, Shere Ali's younger son, who had been\r\nholding Herat during the British operations at Kabul and Kandahar, set\r\nout towards Kandahar with a small army in June 1880, and a brigade under\r\nGeneral Burrows was detached from Kandahar to oppose him. Burrows\r\nadvanced to the Helmund, opposite Girishk, to oppose Ayub Khan, but was\r\nthere deserted by the troops of Shere Ali, the wali of Kandahar, and\r\nforced to retreat to Kushk-i-Nakhud, half way to Kandahar. In order to\r\nprevent Ayub passing to Ghazni, Burrows advanced to Maiwand on the 27th\r\nof July, and attacked Ayub, who had already seized that place. The\r\nAfghans, who numbered 25,000, outflanked the British, the artillery\r\nexpended their ammunition, and the native portion of the Brigade got out\r\nof hand and pressed back on the few British infantry. The British were\r\ncompletely routed, and had to thank the apathy of the Afghans for\r\nescaping total annihilation. Of the 2476 British troops engaged, 934\r\nwere killed and 175 wounded or missing. This defeat necessitated Sir\r\nFrederick Roberts' famous march from Kabul to Kandahar.\r\n\r\n  See Lord Roberts, _Forty-one Years in India_ (1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIZE, or INDIAN CORN, _Zea Mays_ (from [Greek: zeá] or [Greek: zeiá],\r\nwhich appears to have been \"spelt,\" _Triticum spelta_, according to the\r\ndescription of Theophrastus), a plant of the tribe Maydeae of the order\r\nGramineae or grasses (see fig. 1). It is unknown in the native state,\r\nbut is most probably indigenous to tropical America. Small grains of an\r\nunknown variety have been found in the ancient tombs of Peru, and Darwin\r\nfound heads of maize embedded on the shore in Peru at 85 ft. above the\r\npresent sea-level. Bonafous, however (_Histoire naturelle du maïs_),\r\nquotes authorities (Bock, 1532, Ruel and Fuchs) as believing that it\r\ncame from Asia, and maize was said by Santa Rosa de Viterbo to have been\r\nbrought by the Arabs into Spain in the 13th century. A drawing of maize\r\nis also given by Bonafous from a Chinese work on natural history,\r\n_Li-chi-tchin_, dated 1562, a little over sixty years after the\r\ndiscovery of the New World. It is not figured on Egyptian monuments, nor\r\nwas any mention made of it by Eastern travellers in Africa or Asia prior\r\nto the 16th century. Humboldt, Alphonse de Candolle and others, however,\r\ndo not hesitate to say that it originated solely in America, where it\r\nhad been long and extensively cultivated at the period of the discovery\r\nof the New World; and that is the generally accepted modern view. Some\r\nhold the view that maize originated from a common Mexican fodder grass,\r\n_Euchlaena mexicana_, known as Teosinte, a closely allied plant which\r\nwhen crossed with maize yields a maize-like hybrid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nMaize--_Zea Mays_--unripe cob.

They are invested by the\r\nsheaths of leaves, much used in packing oranges in south Europe, and the\r\nmore delicate ones for cigarettes in South America. Fig. 2 shows a\r\nbranch of the terminal male inflorescence. Fig. 3 is a single spikelet\r\nof the same, containing two florets, with the three stamens of one only\r\nprotruded. Fig. 4 is a spike of the female inflorescence, protected by\r\nthe sheaths of leaves--the blades being also present. Usually the\r\nsheaths terminate in a point, the blades being arrested. Fig. 5 is a\r\nspikelet of the female inflorescence, consisting of two outer glumes,\r\nthe lower one ciliated, which enclose two florets--one (a) barren\r\n(sometimes fertile), consisting of a flowering glume and pale only, and\r\nthe other (b) fertile, containing the pistil with elongated style. The\r\nmass of styles from the whole spike is pendulous from the summit of the\r\nsheaths, as in fig. 4. Fig. 6 shows the fruit or grain. More than three\r\nhundred varieties are known, which differ more among themselves than\r\nthose of any other cereal. Some come to maturity in two months, others\r\nrequire seven months; some are as many feet high as others are inches;\r\nsome have kernels eleven times larger than others. They vary similarly\r\nin shape and size of ears, colour of the grain, which may be white,\r\nyellow, purple, striped, &c., and also in physical characters and\r\nchemical composition. Dr E. Lewis Sturtevant, who has made an extended\r\nstudy of the forms and varieties, classes into seven groups those grown\r\nprimarily for the grain, the distinguishing characters of which are\r\nbased on the grains or kernels; there are, in addition, forms of\r\nhorticultural interest grown for ornament. Pod corn (var. _tunicata_) is\r\ncharacterized by having each kernel enclosed in a husk. Pop corn (var.\r\n_everta_) has a very large proportion of the \"endosperm\"--the nutritious\r\nmatter which with the small embryo makes up the grain--of a horny\r\nconsistency, which causes the grain to pop when heated, that is to say,\r\nthe kernel becomes turned inside out by the explosion of the contained\r\nmoisture. It is also characterized by the small size of the grain and\r\near. Flint corn (var. _indurata_) has a starchy endosperm enclosed in a\r\nhorny layer of varying thickness in the different varieties. The colour\r\nof the grain is white, yellow, red, blue or variegated. It is commonly\r\ncultivated in Canada and northern United States, where the seasons are\r\ntoo short for Dent corn, and has been grown as far north as 50° N. lat.\r\nDent or field corn (var. _indentata_) has the starchy endosperm\r\nextending to the summit of the grain, with horny endosperm at the sides.\r\nThe top of the grain becomes indented, owing to the drying and shrinkage\r\nof the starchy matter; the character of the indented surface varies with\r\nthe height and thickness of the horny endosperm. This is the form\r\ncommonly grown in the United States; the varieties differ widely in the\r\nsize of the plants and the appearance of the ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Female Spikelet.]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the grain varies greatly, being generally white, yellow,\r\nmottled red, or less commonly red. Soft corn (var. _amylacea_) has no\r\nhorny endosperm, and hence the grains shrink uniformly. It is cultivated\r\nonly to a limited extent in the United States, but seems to have been\r\ncommonly grown by the Indians in many localities in North and South\r\nAmerica. Sweet corn (var. _saccharata_) is characterized by the\r\ntranslucent horny appearance of the grains and their more or less\r\nwrinkled condition. It is pre-eminently a garden vegetable, the ear\r\nbeing used before the grain hardens, when it is well filled but soft and\r\nmilky. It is often cooked and served in the cob; when canned it is cut\r\nfrom the cob. Canned sweet corn is an important article of domestic\r\ncommerce in Canada and the United States. In starchy sweet corn (var.\r\n_amylea-saccharata_) the grain has the external appearance of sweet\r\ncorn, but examination shows the lower half to be starchy, the upper\r\nhorny and translucent. A form of flint corn, with variegated leaves, is\r\ngrown for ornament under the name _Zea japonica_ or Japanese striped\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Grain.]\r\n\r\nChemical analysis, like common experience, shows that Indian corn is a\r\nvery nutritious article of food, being richer in albuminoids than any\r\nother cereals when ripe (calculated in the dry weight). It can be grown\r\nin the tropics from the level of the sea to a height equal to that of\r\nthe Pyrenees and in the south and middle of Europe, but it cannot be\r\ngrown in England with any chance of profit, except perhaps as fodder.\r\nFrost kills the plant in all its stages and all its varieties; and the\r\ncrop does not flourish well if the nights are cool, no matter how\r\nfavourable the other conditions. Consequently it is the first crop to\r\ndisappear as one ascends into the mountain regions, and comparatively\r\nlittle is grown west of the great plains of North America. In Brittany,\r\nwhere it scarcely ripens the grain, it furnishes a strong crop in the\r\nautumn upon sandy soil where clover and lucerne will yield but a poor\r\nproduce. It prefers a deep, rich, warm, dry and mellow soil, and hence\r\nthe rich bottoms and fertile prairies of the Mississippi basin\r\nconstitute the region of its greatest production. It is extensively\r\ngrown throughout India, both for the ripe grain and for use of the\r\nunripe cob as a green vegetable. It is the most common crop throughout\r\nSouth Africa, where it is known as mealies, being the staple food of the\r\nnatives. It is also largely used for fodder and is an important article\r\nof export.\r\n\r\nAs an article of food maize is one of the most extensively used grains\r\nin the world. Although rich in nitrogenous matter and fat, it does not\r\nmake good bread. A mixture of rye and corn meal, however, makes an\r\nexcellent coarse bread, formerly much used in the Atlantic states, and a\r\nsimilar bread is now the chief coarse bread of Portugal and some parts\r\nof Spain. It is either baked into cakes, called _tortilla_ by the\r\nIndians of Yucatan, or made into a kind of porridge, as in Ireland. When\r\ndeprived of the gluten it constitutes oswego, maizena or corn flour.\r\nMaize contains more oil than any other cereal, ranging from 3.5 to 9.5%\r\nin the commercial grain. This is one of the factors in its value for\r\nfattening purposes. In distilling and some other processes this oil is\r\nseparated and forms an article of commerce. When maize is sown,\r\nbroadcast or closely planted in drills the ears may not develop at all,\r\nbut the stalk is richer in sugar and sweeter; and this is the basis of\r\ngrowing \"corn-fodder.\" The amount of forage that may be produced in this\r\nway is enormous; 50,000 to 80,000 lb. of green fodder are grown per\r\nacre, which makes 8000 to 12,000 lb. as field-cured. Sugar and molasses\r\nhave from time to time been manufactured from the corn stalks.\r\n\r\n  See articles on corn and _Zea Mays_ in L. H. Bailey's _Cyclopaedia of\r\n  American Horticulture_ (1900-1902); and for cultivation in India,\r\n  Watt's _Dictionary of the Economic Products of India_, vi. (1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJESTY (Fr. _majesté_; Lat. _majestas_, grandeur, greatness, from the\r\nbase _mag-_, as in _magnus_, great, _major_, greater, &c.), dignity,\r\ngreatness, a term especially used to express the dignity and power of a\r\nsovereign. This application is to be traced to the use of _majestas_ in\r\nLatin to express the supreme sovereign dignity of the Roman state, the\r\n_majestas reipublicae_ or _populi Romani_, hence _majestatem laedere_ or\r\n_minuere_, was to commit high treason, _crimen majestatis_. (For the\r\nmodern law and usage of _laesa majestas, lèse majesté,\r\nMajestätsbeleidigung_, see TREASON.) From the republic _majestas_ was\r\ntransferred to the emperors, and the _majestas populi Romani_ became the\r\n_majestas imperii_, and _augustalis majestas_ is used as a term to\r\nexpress the sovereign person of the emperor. Honorius and Theodosius\r\nspeak of themselves in the first person as _nostra majestas_. The term\r\n\"majesty\" was strictly confined in the middle ages to the successors of\r\nthe Roman emperors in the West, and at the treaty of Cambrai (1529) it\r\nis reserved for the emperor Charles V. Later the word is used of kings\r\nalso, and the distinction is made between imperial majesty (_caesareana\r\nmajestas_) and kingly or royal majesty. From the 16th century dates the\r\napplication of \"Most Christian and Catholic Majesty\" to the kings of\r\nFrance, of \"Catholic Majesty\" to the kings of Spain, of \"Most Faithful\r\nMajesty\" to the kings of Portugal, and \"Apostolic Majesty\" to the kings\r\nof Hungary. In England the use is generally assigned to the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., but it is found, though not in general usage, earlier; thus\r\nthe _New English Dictionary_ quotes from an _Address of the Kings Clerks\r\nto Henry II._ in 1171 (Materials for the History of Archbishop Becket,\r\nvii. 471, Rolls Series, 1885), where the king is styled _vestra\r\nmajestas_, and Selden (_Titles of Honour_, part i. ch. 7, p. 98, ed.\r\n1672) finds many early uses in letters to Edward I., in charters of\r\ncreation of peers, &c. The fullest form in English usage is \"His Most\r\nGracious Majesty\"; another form is \"The King's Most Excellent Majesty,\"\r\nas in the English Prayer-book. \"His Sacred Majesty\" was common in the\r\n17th century; and of this form Selden says: \"It is true, I think, that\r\nin our memory or the memory of our fathers, the use of it first began in\r\nEngland.\" \"His Majesty,\" abbreviated H.M., is now the universal European\r\nuse in speaking of any reigning king, and \"His Imperial Majesty,\"\r\nH.I.M., of any reigning emperor.\r\n\r\nFrom the particular and very early use of \"majesty\" for the glory and\r\nsplendour of God, the term has been used in ecclesiastical art of the\r\nrepresentation of God the Father enthroned in glory, sometimes with the\r\nother persons of the Trinity, and of the Saviour alone, enthroned with\r\nan aureole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJLÁTH, JÁNOS, or JOHN, COUNT (1786-1855), Hungarian historian and\r\npoet, was born at Pest on the 5th of October 1786. First educated at\r\nhome, he subsequently studied philosophy at Eger (Erlau) and law at Györ\r\n(Raab), his father, Count Joseph Majláth, an Austrian minister of state,\r\neventually obtaining for him an appointment in the public service.\r\nMajláth devoted himself to historical research and the translation into\r\nGerman of Magyar folk-tales, and of selections from the works of the\r\nbest of his country's native poets. Moreover, as an original lyrical\r\nwriter, and as an editor and adapter of old German poems, Majláth showed\r\nconsiderable talent. During the greater part of his life he resided\r\neither at Pest or Vienna, but a few years before his death he removed to\r\nMunich, where he fell into a state of destitution and extreme\r\ndespondency. Seized at last by a terrible infatuation, he and his\r\ndaughter Henriette, who had long been his constant companion and\r\namanuensis, drowned themselves in the Lake of Starnberg, a few miles\r\nsouth-west of Munich, on the 3rd of January 1855.\r\n\r\n  Of his historical works the most important are the _Geschichte der\r\n  Magyaren_ (Vienna, 1828-1831, 5 vols.; 2nd ed., Ratisbon, 1852-1853)\r\n  and his _Geschichte des österreichischen Kaiserstaats_ (Hamburg,\r\n  1834-1850, 5 vols.). Specially noteworthy among his metrical\r\n  translations from the Hungarian are the _Magyarische Gedichte_\r\n  (Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1825); and _Himfy's auserlesene Liebeslieder_\r\n  (Pest, 1829; 2nd ed., 1831). A valuable contribution to folk-lore\r\n  appeared in the _Magyarische Sagen, Märchen und Erzählungen_ (Brünn,\r\n  1825; 2nd ed., Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1837, 2 vols.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOLICA, a name properly applied to a species of Italian ware in which\r\nthe body is coated with a tin-enamel, on which is laid and fired a\r\npainted decoration. It is also applied to similar wares made in\r\nimitation of the Italian ware in other countries. The word in Italian is\r\n_maiolica_. Du Cange (_Gloss. s.v._ \"Majorica\") quotes from a chronicle\r\nof Verona of 1368, in which the form _majolica_ occurs for the more\r\nusual Latin form _majorica_. It has usually been supposed that this type\r\nof pottery was first made in the island of Majorca, but it is more\r\nprobable that the name was given by the Italians to the lustred Spanish\r\nware imported by ships hailing from the Balearic Islands. (See CERAMICS:\r\n_Medieval and Later Italian_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR (or MAIR), JOHN (1470-1550), Scottish theological and historical\r\nwriter, was born at the village of Gleghornie, near North Berwick,\r\nScotland, in the year 1470. He was educated at the school of Haddington,\r\nwhere John Knox was later a pupil. After a short period spent at\r\nCambridge (at God's House, afterwards Christ's College) he entered the\r\nuniversity of Paris in 1493, studying successively at the colleges of St\r\nBarbe, Montaigu and Navarre, and graduating as master of arts in 1496.\r\nPromoted to the doctorate in 1505, he lectured on philosophy at Montaigu\r\nCollege and on theology at Navarre. He visited Scotland in 1515 and\r\nreturned in 1518, when he was appointed principal regent in the\r\nuniversity of Glasgow, John Knox being among the number of those who\r\nattended his lectures there. In 1522 he removed to St Andrew's\r\nUniversity, where in 1525 George Buchanan was one of his pupils. He\r\nreturned to the college of Montaigu in 1525, but was once more at St\r\nAndrew's in 1531, where he was head of St Salvator's College from 1534\r\nuntil his death.\r\n\r\nMajor's voluminous writings may be grouped under (a) logic and\r\nphilosophy, (b) Scripture commentary, and (c) history. All are in Latin,\r\nall appeared between 1503 and 1530, and all were printed at Paris. The\r\nfirst group includes his _Exponabilia_ (1503), his commentary on Petrus\r\nHispanus (1505-1506), his _Inclitarum artium libri_ (1506, &c.), his\r\ncommentary on Joannes Dorp (1504, &c.), his _Insolubilia_ (1516, &c.),\r\nhis introduction to Aristotle's logic (1521, &c.), his commentary on the\r\nethics (1530), and, chief of all, his commentary on Peter Lombard's\r\n_Sentences_ (1509, &c.); the second consists of a commentary on Matthew\r\n(1518) and another on the Four Gospels (1529); the last is represented\r\nby his famous _Historia Majoris Britanniae tam Angliae quam Scotiae per\r\nJ. M._ (1521). In political philosophy he maintained the Scotist\r\nposition, that civil authority was derived from the popular will, but in\r\ntheology he was a scholastic conservative, though he never failed to\r\nshow his approbation of Gallicanism and its plea for the reform of\r\necclesiastical abuses. He has left on record that it was his aim and\r\nhope to reconcile realism and nominalism in the interests of theological\r\npeace. He had a world-wide reputation as a teacher and writer.\r\nBuchanan's severe epigram, perhaps the only unfriendly words in the\r\nflood of contemporary praise, may be explained as a protest against the\r\ncompromise which Major appeared to offer rather than as a personal\r\nattack on his teacher. Major takes a more independent attitude in his\r\n_History_, which is a remarkable example of historical accuracy and\r\ninsight. He claims that the historian's chief duty is to write\r\ntruthfully, and he is careful to show that a theologian may fulfil this\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n  The _History_, on which his fame now rests, was reprinted by Freebairn\r\n  (Edinburgh, 1740), and was translated in 1892 by Archibald Constable\r\n  for the Scottish History Society. The latter volume contains a full\r\n  account of the author by Aeneas J. G. Mackay and a bibliography by\r\n  Thomas Graves Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR (Lat. for \"greater\"), a word used, both as a substantive and\r\nadjective, for that which is greater than another in size, quality,\r\ndegree, importance, &c., often opposed correlatively to that to which\r\n\"minor\" is applied in the same connotation. In the categorical syllogism\r\nin logic, the major term is the term which forms the predicate of the\r\nconclusion, the major premise is that which contains the major term.\r\n(For the distinction between major and minor intervals, and other\r\napplications in music, see MUSIC and HARMONY.)\r\n\r\nThe use of _Major_ as part of an official title in Med. Lat. has given\r\nthe Span. _mayor_, Fr. _maire_, and Eng. \"_mayor_\" (q.v.). In English the\r\nunadapted form \"major\" is the title of a military officer now ranking\r\nbetween a captain and a lieutenant-colonel. Originally the word was used\r\nadjectivally in the title \"sergeant-major,\" an officer of high rank\r\n(third in command of an army) who performed the same duties of\r\nadministration, drill and encampments on the staff of the chief commander\r\nas the sergeant in a company performs as assistant to the captain. This\r\nwas in the latter half of the 16th century, and very soon afterwards the\r\n\"sergeant-major\" became known as the \"sergeant-major-general\"--hence the\r\nmodern title of major-general. By the time of the English Civil War\r\n\"majors\" had been introduced in each regiment of foot, who corresponded\r\nin a lesser sphere to the \"major-general\" of the whole army. The major's\r\nsphere of duties, precedence and title have since varied but little,\r\nthough he has, in the British service, taken the place of the\r\nlieutenant-colonel as second in command--the latter officer exercising\r\nthe command of the cavalry regiment, infantry battalion or artillery\r\nbrigade, and the colonel being, save for certain administrative\r\nfunctions, little more than the titular chief of his regiment. Junior\r\nmajors command companies of infantry; squadrons of cavalry and batteries\r\nof artillery are also commanded by majors. In most European armies,\r\nhowever, and of late years in the army of the United States also, the\r\nmajor has become a battalion commander under the orders of a regimental\r\ncommander (colonel or lieutenant-colonel). The word appears also in the\r\nBritish service in \"brigade-major\" (the adjutant or staff officer of a\r\nbrigade). \"Town-majors\" (garrison staff officers) are now no longer\r\nappointed. In the French service up to 1871 the \"major-general\" was the\r\nchief of the general staff of a field army, and thus preserved the\r\ntradition of the former \"sergeant-major\" or \"sergeant-major-general.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJORCA (_Mallorca_), the largest of the group of Spanish islands in the\r\nMediterranean Sea known as the Balearic Islands (q.v.). Pop. (1900),\r\n248,191; area, 430 sq. m. Majorca has the shape of a trapezoid, with the\r\nangles directed to the cardinal points; and its diagonal, from Cape\r\nGrozer in the west to Cape Pera in the east, is about 60 m. On the\r\nnorth-west the coast is precipitous, but on the other sides it is low\r\nand sloping. On the north-east there are several considerable bays, of\r\nwhich the chief are those of Alcudia and Pollensa; while on the\r\nsouth-west is the still more important bay of Palma. No fewer than\r\ntwelve ports or harbours are enumerated round the island, of which may\r\nbe mentioned Andraitx and Sóller. In the north-west Majorca is traversed\r\nby a chain of mountains running parallel with the coast, and attaining\r\nits highest elevation in Silla de Torrellas (5154 ft.). Towards the\r\nsouth and east the surface is comparatively level, though broken by\r\nisolated peaks of considerable height. The northern mountains afford\r\ngreat protection to the rest of the island from the violent gales to\r\nwhich it would otherwise be exposed, and render the climate remarkably\r\nmild and pleasant. The scenery of Majorca has all the picturesqueness of\r\noutline that usually belongs to a limestone formation. Some of the\r\nvalleys, such as those of Valdemosa and Sóller, with their luxuriant\r\nvegetation, are delightful resorts. There are quarries of marble of\r\nvarious grains and colours--those near Santañy, in the district of\r\nManacor, being especially celebrated; while lead, iron and cinnabar have\r\nalso been obtained. Coal of a jet-like character is found at Benisalem,\r\nwhere it was first worked in 1836; at Selva, where it has been mined\r\nsince 1851; near Santa Maria and elsewhere. It is used in the industrial\r\nestablishments of Palma, and in the manufacture of lime, plaster and\r\nbricks near the mines. A considerable quantity is also exported to\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are principally devoted to agriculture, and most of the\r\narable land is cultivated. The mountains are terraced; and the old pine\r\nwoods have in many places given way to the olive, the vine and the\r\nalmond tree, to fields of wheat and flax, or to orchards of figs and\r\noranges. For the last-mentioned fruits the valley of Sóller is one of\r\nthe most important districts, the produce being largely transmitted to\r\nFrance. The yield of oil is very considerable, and Inca is the centre of\r\nthe oil district. The wines are light but excellent, especially the\r\nMuscadel and Montona. During the summer there is often great scarcity of\r\nwater; but, according to a system handed down by the Moors, the rains of\r\nautumn and winter are collected in enormous reservoirs, which contain\r\nsufficient water to last through the dry season; and on the payment of a\r\ncertain rate, each landholder has his fields flooded at certain\r\nintervals. Mules are used in the agriculture and traffic of the island.\r\nThe cattle are small, but the sheep are large and well fleeced. Pigs are\r\nreared for export to Barcelona, and there is abundance of poultry and\r\nsmall game. Brandy is made and exported in large quantities. Excellent\r\nwoollen and linen cloths are woven; the silkworm is reared and its\r\nproduce manufactured; and canvas, rope and cord are largely made, from\r\nboth native and foreign materials.\r\n\r\nThe roads are excellent, the four principal being those from Alcudia,\r\nManacor, Sóller and Andraitx to the capital. Forty-eight miles of\r\nrailway were open at the beginning of the 20th century. The main line\r\nruns from Palma to Manacor and Alcudia. The telegraphic system is fairly\r\ncomplete, and there is regular steam communication with Barcelona and\r\nAlicante. The principal towns include--besides Palma (63,937), Felanitx\r\n(11,294) and Manacor (12,408), which are described in separate\r\narticles--Andraitx (6516), Inca (7579), Llummayor (8859), Pollensa\r\n(8308), Santañy (6692) and Sóller (8026).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJORIAN (JULIUS VALERIUS MAJORIANUS), emperor of the West from 457 to\r\n461. He had distinguished himself as a general by victories over the\r\nFranks and Alemanni, and six months after the deposition of Avitus he\r\nwas declared emperor by the regent Ricimer. After repelling an attack by\r\nthe Vandals upon Campania (458) he prepared a large force, composed\r\nchiefly of barbarians, to invade Africa, which he previously visited in\r\ndisguise. Having during his stay in Gaul defeated and concluded an\r\nalliance with Theodoric the Visigoth, at the beginning of 460 he crossed\r\nthe Pyrenees for the purpose of joining the powerful fleet which he had\r\ncollected at Carthagena. The Vandal king Genseric, however, after all\r\novertures of peace had been rejected, succeeded through the treachery of\r\ncertain officers in surprising the Roman fleet, most of the ships being\r\neither taken or destroyed. Majorian thereupon made peace with Genseric.\r\nBut his ill-success had destroyed his military reputation; his efforts\r\nto put down abuses and improve the condition of the people had roused\r\nthe hatred of the officials; and Ricimer, jealous of his fame and\r\ninfluence, stirred up the foreign troops against him. A mutiny broke out\r\nin Lombardy, and on the 2nd of August 461 Majorian was forced to resign.\r\nHe died five days afterwards, either of dysentery or by violence.\r\nMajorian was the author of a number of remarkable laws, contained in the\r\nTheodosian Code. He remitted all arrears of taxes, the collection of\r\nwhich was for the future placed in the hands of the local officials. He\r\nrevived the institution of _defensores_, defenders of cities, whose duty\r\nit was to protect the poor and inform the emperor of abuses committed in\r\nhis name. The practice of pulling down the ancient monuments to be used\r\nas building material, which was connived at by venal officials, was\r\nstrictly prohibited. He also passed laws against compulsory ordination\r\nand premature vows of celibacy.\r\n\r\n  See Sidonius Apollinaris, _Panegyric of Majorian_; Gibbon, _Decline\r\n  and Fall_, ch. xxxvi. (where an outline of the \"novels\" of Majorian is\r\n  given); J. B. Bury, _Later Roman Empire_, bk. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJORITY (Fr. _majorité_; Med. Lat. _majoritas_; Lat. _major_, greater),\r\na term signifying the greater number. In legislative and deliberative\r\nassemblies it is usual to decide questions by a majority of those\r\npresent at a meeting and voting. In law, majority is the state of being\r\nof full age, which in the United Kingdom is twenty-one years of age. A\r\nperson attains his majority at twelve o'clock at night of the day\r\npreceding his twenty-first birthday (see INFANT; AGE).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJUBA (properly AMAJUBA, Zulu for \"the hill of doves\"), a mountain in\r\nnorthern Natal, part of the Drakensberg range, rising about 7000 ft.\r\nabove the sea and over 2000 ft. above the level of the surrounding\r\ncountry. It overlooks the pass through the Drakensberg known as Laing's\r\nNek, is 8 m. S. of the Transvaal border and 18 m. N. of the town of\r\nNewcastle. The railway from Durban to Johannesburg skirts the base of\r\nthe mountain. During the Boer War of 1880-81 Majuba was occupied on the\r\nnight of the 26th of February 1881 by some 600 British troops under Sir\r\nGeorge Pomeroy Colley. On the following morning the hill was stormed by\r\nthe Boers under Piet Joubert and the British routed, Colley being among\r\nthe slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKALAKA, a general designation used by the Bechuana, Matabele and\r\nkindred peoples, for conquered or slave tribes. Thus many of the tribes\r\nsubjugated by the Makololo chief, Sebituane, about 1830 were called\r\nMakalaka (see David Livingstone's _Missionary Travels and Researches in\r\nSouth Africa_, London, 1857). By early writers on south-central Africa\r\ncertain of the inhabitants of Barotseland were styled Makalaka; the name\r\nis more frequently used to designate the Makalanga, one of the tribes\r\nnow classed as Mashonas (q.v.), who were brought into subjection by the\r\nMatabele.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKARAKA, or IDDIO (\"Cannibals\"), a negroid people of Central Africa,\r\nclosely related to the powerful Azandeh or Niam-Niam race, occupying the\r\nBahr-el-Ghazal west of Lado. They came originally from the country of\r\nthe Kibas, north of the Welle. Dr W. Junker described them as among the\r\nmost trustworthy, industrious and intelligent people of the\r\nBahr-el-Ghazal. They are a reddish-black, with nose less flat and\r\ncheek-bones less prominent than the ordinary negroes, and, unlike the\r\nlatter, do not extract the incisors. Their long silky hair is built up\r\nin the most fantastic form by means of vegetable substances. They are\r\nwell-known for strength and staying power.\r\n\r\n  See W. Junker, _Travels in Africa_ (1890-1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKART, HANS (1840-1884), Austrian painter, born at Salzburg, was the\r\nson of an inspector of the imperial castle. He has been aptly called the\r\nfirst German _painter_ of the 19th century. When he, as a youth, entered\r\nthe Vienna Academy German art was under the rule of Cornelius's cold\r\nclassicism. It was entirely intellectual and academic. Clear and precise\r\ndrawing, sculpturesque modelling, and pictorial erudition were the\r\nqualities most esteemed; and it is not surprising that Makart, poor\r\ndraughtsman to the very last, with a passionate and sensual love of\r\ncolour, and ever impatient to escape the routine of art-school drawing,\r\nwas found to be \"devoid of all talent\" and forced to leave the Vienna\r\nAcademy. He went to Munich, and after two years of independent study\r\nattracted the attention of Piloty, under whose guidance he made rapid\r\nand astonishing progress. The first picture he painted under Piloty,\r\n\"Lavoisier in Prison,\" though timid and conventional, attracted\r\nattention by its sense of colour. In the next, \"The Knight and the Water\r\nNymphs,\" he first displayed the decorative qualities to which he\r\nafterwards sacrificed everything else in his work. With the \"Cupids\" and\r\n\"The Plague in Florence\" of the next year his fame became firmly\r\nestablished. \"Romeo and Juliet\" was soon after bought by the Austrian\r\nemperor for the Vienna Museum, and Makart was invited to come to Vienna,\r\nwhere a large studio was placed at his disposal. In Vienna Makart became\r\nthe acknowledged leader of the artistic life of the city, which in the\r\n'seventies passed through a period of feverish activity, the chief\r\nresults of which are the sumptuously decorated public buildings of the\r\nRingstrasse.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the time, the splendour of the fêtes over which Makart\r\npresided, and the very obvious appeal of his huge compositions in their\r\nglowing richness of colour, in which he tried to emulate Rubens, made\r\nhim appear a very giant to his contemporaries in Vienna, and indeed in\r\nall Austria and Germany. The appearance of each of his ambitious\r\nhistorical and allegorical paintings was hailed with enthusiasm--the\r\n\"Catherina Cornaro,\" \"Diana's Hunt,\" \"The Entry of Charles V. into\r\nAntwerp,\" \"Abundantia,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" \"The Death of Cleopatra\" and\r\nthe \"Five Senses.\" He reached the zenith of his fame when, in 1879, he\r\ndesigned, single-handed, the costumes, scenic setting, and triumphal\r\ncars of the grand pageant with which the citizens of Vienna celebrated\r\nthe silver wedding of their rulers. Some 15,000 people participated in\r\nthe pageant, all dressed in the costumes of the Rubens and Rembrandt\r\nperiod. Makart died in Vienna in October 1884.\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately Makart was in the habit of using such villainous\r\n  pigments and mediums that in the few decades which have passed since\r\n  his death, the vast majority of his large paintings have practically\r\n  perished. The blues have turned into green; the bitumen has eaten away\r\n  the rich glow of the colour harmonies; the thickly applied paint has\r\n  cracked and in some instances crumbled away. And this loss of their\r\n  chief quality has accentuated the weaknesses of these pictures--the\r\n  faulty drawing, careless and hasty execution, lack of deeper\r\n  significance and prevalence of glaring anachronisms. Important\r\n  examples of his work are to be found at the galleries of Vienna,\r\n  Berlin, Hamburg and Stuttgart. For the Vienna Museum he also executed\r\n  a series of decorative lunettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING-UP PRICE, a term used in the London and other British Stock\r\nExchanges, to denote the price at which speculative bargains are carried\r\nover from one account to the next. The carrying over of a \"bull\"\r\nposition in Eries, for example, implies a sale for cash and a\r\nsimultaneous repurchase for the new account, both bargains being done at\r\nthe making-up price. This is fixed at noon on carry-over day, in\r\naccordance with the market price then current (see ACCOUNT; STOCK\r\nEXCHANGE). The term is also used in New York, where the making-up prices\r\nare fixed at the end of a day's business, in accordance with the\r\nAmerican system of daily settlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKÓ, a town of Hungary, capital of the county of Csanád 135 m. S.E. of\r\nBudapest by rail. Pop. (1900), 33,701. It is situated near the right\r\nbank of the Maros, and is a typical Hungarian town of the Alföld. The\r\nmost noteworthy building is the palace of the bishop of Csanád, whose\r\nusual residence is in Temesvár. The town possesses numerous mills, and\r\nthe surrounding country is fertile. The communal lands are extensive;\r\nthey afford excellent pasturage for horses and sheep and also for large\r\nherds of horned cattle, for the size and quality of which Makó has\r\nobtained a high repute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKRAN, or MEKRAN, a province of Baluchistan, fringing the Arabian Sea\r\nfrom Persia almost to Sind for about 200 m. It is subject to the khan of\r\nKalat under British political supervision. Estimated area, 26,000 sq.\r\nm.; estimated pop. (1903), 78,000. The long lateral valley of Kej is\r\nusually associated with Makran in early geographical records. The\r\nKej-Macoran of Marco Polo is the Makran of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe long stretch of sandy foreshore is broken on the coast-line by the\r\nmagnificent cliffs of Malan, the hammer-shaped headlands of Ormarah and\r\nGwadar, and the precipitous cliffs of Jebel Zarain, near Pasni. Within\r\nthem lies the usual frontier band of parallel ridges, alternating with\r\nnarrow valleys. Amongst them the ranges called Talana and Talur are\r\nconspicuous by their height and regular configuration. The normal\r\nconformation of the Baluchistan frontier is somewhat emphasized in\r\nMakran. Here the volcanic action, which preceded the general upheaval of\r\nrecent strata and the folding of the edges of the interior highlands, is\r\nstill in evidence in occasional boiling mud volcanoes on the coast-line.\r\nIt is repeated in the blazing summit of the Kuh-i-taftan (the burning\r\nmountain of the Persian frontier) which is the highest active volcano in\r\nAsia (13,000 ft.), and probably the farthest inland. Evidence of extinct\r\nmud volcanoes exists through a very wide area in Baluchistan and\r\nSeistan. Probably the _miri_, or fort, at Quetta represents one of them.\r\nThe coast is indented by several harbours. Ormarah, Khor Kalmat, Pasni\r\nand Gwadar are all somewhat difficult of approach by reason of a\r\nsand-bar which appears to extend along the whole coast-line, and which\r\nis very possibly the last evidence of a submerged ridge; and they are\r\nall subject to a very lively surf under certain conditions of wind. Of\r\nthese the port of Gwadar (which belongs to Muscat and is therefore\r\nforeign territory) is the most important. They all are (or were)\r\nstations of the Indo-Persian telegraph system which unites Karachi with\r\nBushire. With the exception of the Kej valley, and that of the Bolida,\r\nwhich is an affluent of the Kej, there are no considerable spaces of\r\ncultivation in Makran. These two valleys seem to concentrate the whole\r\nagricultural wealth of the country. They are picturesque, with thick\r\ngroves of date palms at intervals, and are filled with crops and\r\norchards. They are indeed exceedingly beautiful; and yet the surrounding\r\nwaste of hills is chiefly a barren repetition of sun-cracked crags and\r\nridges with parched and withered valleys intersecting them, where a\r\ntrickle of salt water leaves a white and leprous streak amongst the\r\nfaded tamarisk or the yellow stalks of last season's grass. Makran is\r\nthe home of remnants of an innumerable company of mixed people gathered\r\nfrom the four corners of Asia and eastern Africa. The ancient\r\nDravidians, of whom the Brahui is typical, still exist in many of the\r\ndistricts which are assigned to them in Herodotus. Amongst them there is\r\nalways a prominent Arab element, for the Arabs held Makran even before\r\nthey conquered Sind and made the Kej valley their trade highway to\r\nIndia. There are negroes on the coast, bred from imported slaves. The\r\nMeds of the Indus valley still form the greater part of the fishing\r\npopulation, representing the Ichthyophagi of Arrian. The old Tajik\r\nelement of Persia is not so evident in Makran as it is farther north;\r\nand the Karak pirates whose depredations led to the invasion of India\r\nand the conquest of Sind, seem to have disappeared altogether. The\r\nfourth section includes the valleys formed by the Rakshan and Mashkel,\r\nwhich, sweeping downwards from the Kalat highlands and the Persian\r\nborder east and west, unite to break through the intervening chain of\r\nhills northward to form the Mashkel swamps, and define the northern\r\nlimits of Makran. In these valleys are narrow strips of very advanced\r\ncultivation, the dates of Panjgur being generally reckoned superior even\r\nto those of the Euphrates. The great Mashkel swamp and the Kharan desert\r\nto the east of it, mark the flat phase of southern Baluchistan\r\ntopography. It is geologically part of an ancient inland lake or sea\r\nwhich included the present swamp regions of the Helmund, but not the\r\ncentral depression of the Lora. The latter is buttressed against hills\r\nat a much higher elevation than the Kharan desert, which is separated\r\nfrom the great expanse of the Helmund desert within the borders of\r\nAfghanistan by a transverse band of serrated hills forming a distinct\r\nwatershed from Nushki to Seistan. Here and there these jagged peaks\r\nappear as if half overwhelmed by an advancing sea of sand. They are\r\ntreeless and barren, and water is but rarely found at the edges of their\r\nfoothills. The Koh-i-Sultan, at the western extremity of the northern\r\ngroup of these irregular hills, is over 6000 ft. above sea-level, but\r\nthe general level of the surrounding deserts is only about 2000 ft.,\r\nsinking to 1500 ft. in the Mashkel Hamun and the Gaod-i-Zirreh.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this country has been surveyed by Indian surveyors and the\r\nboundary between Persian and British Baluchistan was demarcated by a\r\ncommission in 1895-1896. In 1898 a column of British troops under\r\nColonel Mayne was despatched to Makran by sea, owing to a rebellion\r\nagainst the authority of the khan of Kalat, and an attack made by some\r\nMakran chiefs on a British survey party. The campaign was short and\r\nterminated with the capture of the Kej citadel. Another similar\r\nexpedition was required in 1901 to storm the fort at Nodiz. The\r\nheadquarters of the native governor, under the khan of Kalat, are at\r\nTurbat, with deputies at Tump, Kolwa, Pasni and Panjgur. A levy corps,\r\nwith two British officers, is stationed along the western frontier. The\r\nport of Gwadur forms an enclave belonging to the sultan of Muscat.\r\n\r\n  _Baluchistan District Gazetteer_, vol. vii. (Bombay, 1907).\r\n       (T. H. H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKSOORA, the term in Mahommedan architecture given to the sanctuary or\r\npraying-chamber in a mosque, which was sometimes enclosed with a screen\r\nof lattice-work; the word is occasionally used for a similar enclosure\r\nround a tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALABAR, a district of British India, in the Madras Presidency.\r\nGeographically the name is sometimes extended to the entire western\r\ncoast of the peninsula. Properly it should apply to the strip below the\r\nGhats, which is inhabited by people speaking the Malayalam language, a\r\nbranch of the Dravidian stock, who form a peculiar race, with castes,\r\ncustoms and traditions of their own. It would thus be coextensive with\r\nthe old kingdom of Chera, including the modern states of Travancore and\r\nCochin, and part of Kanara. In 1901 the total number of persons speaking\r\nMalayalam in all India was 6,029,304.\r\n\r\nThe district of Malabar extends for 145 m. along the coast, running\r\ninland to the Ghats with a breadth varying from 70 to 25 m. The\r\nadministrative headquarters are at Calicut. Area, 5795 sq. m. Malabar is\r\nsingularly diversified in its configuration; from the eastward, the\r\ngreat range of the Western Ghats, only interrupted by the Palghat gap,\r\nlooks down on a country broken by long spurs, extensive ravines, dense\r\nforests and tangled jungle. To the westward, gentler slopes and downs,\r\nand gradually widening valleys closely cultivated, succeed the forest\r\nuplands, till, nearer the seaboard, the low laterite table-lands shelve\r\ninto rice plains and backwaters fringed with coco-nut palms. The coast\r\nruns in a south-easterly direction, and forms a few headlands and small\r\nbays, with a natural harbour in the south at Cochin. In the south there\r\nis considerable extent of table-land. The mountains of the Western Ghats\r\nrun almost parallel to the coast, and vary from 3000 to 7000 ft. in\r\nheight. One of the most characteristic features of Malabar is an all but\r\ncontinuous chain of lagoons or backwaters lying parallel to the coast,\r\nwhich have been formed by the action of the waves and shore currents in\r\nobstructing the waters of the rivers. Connected by artificial canals,\r\nthey form a cheap means of transit; and a large local trade is carried\r\non by inland navigation. Fishing and fishcuring is an important\r\nindustry. The forests are extensive and of great value, but they are\r\nalmost entirely private property. The few tracts which are conserved\r\nhave come into government hands by escheat or by contract. Wild animals\r\ninclude the elephant, tiger, panther, bison, _sambhar_, spotted deer,\r\nNilgiri ibex, and bear. The population in 1901 was 2,800,555, showing an\r\nincrease of 5.6% in the decade.\r\n\r\nThe staple crop is rice, the next most important product being\r\ncoco-nuts. Coffee is grown chiefly in the upland tract known as the\r\nWynaad, where there are also a few acres under tea. The Madras railway\r\ncrosses the district and has been extended from Calicut to Cannanore\r\nalong the coast. There are eleven seaports, of which the principal are\r\nCalicut, Tellicherry, Cannanore and Cochin. The principal exports are\r\ncoffee, coco-nut products and timber. There are factories for cleaning\r\ncoffee, pressing coir and making matting, making tiles, sawing timber\r\nand weaving cotton.\r\n\r\n  See _Malabar District Gazetteer_ (Madras, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALABARI, BEHRAMJI (1853-   ), Indian journalist and social reformer, was\r\nborn in 1853 at Baroda, the son of a poor Parsi in the employment of the\r\nstate, who died shortly after his birth. His mother took him to Surat,\r\nwhere he was educated in a mission school, but he never succeeded in\r\ngaining an academical degree. Coming to Bombay, he fell under the\r\ninfluence of Dr John Wilson, principal of the Scottish College. As early\r\nas 1875 he published a volume of poems in Gujarati, followed in 1877 by\r\n_The Indian Muse in English Garb_, which attracted attention in England,\r\nnotably from Tennyson, Max Müller, and Florence Nightingale. His life\r\nwork began in 1880 when he acquired the _Indian Spectator_, which he\r\nedited for twenty years until it was merged in the _Voice of India_. In\r\n1901 he became editor of _East and West_. Always holding aloof from\r\npolitics, he was an ardent and indefatigable advocate of social reform\r\nin India, especially as regards child marriage and the remarriage of\r\nwidows. It was largely by his efforts, both in the press and in tours\r\nthrough the country, that the Age of Consent Act was passed in 1891. His\r\naccount of his visits to England, entitled _The Indian Eye on English\r\nLife_ (1893), passed through three editions, and an earlier book of a\r\nsomewhat satirical nature, _Gujarat and the Gujaratis_ (1883), was\r\nequally popular.\r\n\r\n  See R. P. Karkaria, _India, Forty Years of Progress and Reform_,\r\n  (London, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALABON, a town of the province of Rizal, Luzon, Philippine Islands, 1\r\nm. inland from the shore of Manila Bay and 3 m. N. of the city of\r\nManila, with which it is connected by an electric tramway. Pop. (1903),\r\n20,136. The leading industries are the refining of sugar, fishing,\r\ntrade, the weaving of jusi cloth, the making of cigars, and the\r\ncultivation of ilang-ilang-trees (_Cananga odorata_) for their flowers,\r\nfrom which a fine perfume is distilled; ilang-ilang is one of the\r\nprincipal exports, mostly to France. Tagalog and Spanish are the\r\nprincipal languages. Malabon was formerly known as Tambóbong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACCA, a town on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, in 2° 14´ N.,\r\n102° 12´ E., which, with the territory lying immediately around and\r\nbehind it forms one of the Straits Settlements, and gives its name to\r\nthe Straits which divide Sumatra from the Malay Peninsula. Its name,\r\nwhich is more correctly transliterated _melaka_, is that of a species of\r\njungle fruit, and is also borne by the small river on the right bank of\r\nwhich the old Dutch town stands. The Dutch town is connected by a bridge\r\nwith the business quarter on the left bank, which is inhabited almost\r\nexclusively by Chinese, Eurasians and Malays.\r\n\r\nMalacca, now a somnolent little town, a favourite resort of rich Chinese\r\nwho have retired from business, is visited by few ships and is the least\r\nimportant of the three British settlements on the Straits which give\r\ntheir name to the colony. It has, however, a remarkable history. The\r\nprecise date of its foundation cannot be ascertained, but there is\r\nstrong reason to believe that this event took place at the earliest in\r\nthe 14th century. The Roman youth Ludovigo Barthema is believed to have\r\nbeen the first European to visit it, some time before 1503; and in 1509\r\nDiogo Lopez de Siqueira sailed from Portugal for the express purpose of\r\nexploiting Malacca. At first he was hospitably received, but\r\ndisagreements with the natives ensued and word was brought to Siqueira\r\nby Magellan, who was one of his company, that a treacherous attack was\r\nabout to be made upon his ships. Siqueira then sent a native man and\r\nwoman ashore \"with an arrow passed through their skulls\" to the sultan,\r\n\"who was thus informed,\" says de Barros, \"through his subjects that\r\nunless he kept a good watch the treason which he had perpetrated would\r\nbe punished with fire and sword.\" The sultan retaliated by arresting Ruy\r\nde Araujo, the factor, and twenty other men who were ashore with him\r\ncollecting cargo for the ships. Siqueira immediately burned one of his\r\nvessels and sailed direct for Portugal. In 1510 Mendez de Vasconcellos\r\nwith a fleet of four ships set out from Portugal \"to go and conquer\r\nMalacca,\" but d'Alboquerque detained him at Goa, and it was not until\r\n1511 that d'Alboquerque himself found time to visit Malacca and seek to\r\nrescue the Portuguese prisoners who all this time had remained in the\r\nhands of the sultan. An attack was delivered by d'Alboquerque on the\r\n25th of July 1511, but it was only partially successful, and it was not\r\nuntil the 4th of August, when the assault was repeated, that the place\r\nfinally fell. Since that time Malacca has continued to be the possession\r\nof one or another of the European Powers. It was a Portuguese possession\r\nfor 130 years, and was the headquarters of their trade and the base of\r\ntheir commercial explorations in south-eastern Asia while they enjoyed,\r\nand later while they sought to hold, their monopoly in the East. It was\r\nfrom Malacca, immediately after its conquest, that d'Alboquerque sent\r\nd'Abreu on his voyage of discovery to the Moluccas, or Spice Islands,\r\nwhich later were the objective of Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation.\r\nDuring the Portuguese tenure of Malacca the place was attacked at least\r\ntwice by the Achinese; its shipping was harried by Lancaster in 1592,\r\nwhen the first British fleet made its way into these seas; it was\r\nbesieged by the Dutch in 1606, and finally fell to a joint attack of the\r\nDutch and the Achinese in 1641. It was under the Portuguese government\r\nthat St Francis Xavier started a mission in Malacca, the first Christian\r\nmission in Malayan lands.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch held Malacca till 1795, when it was taken from them by Great\r\nBritain, and the Dutch system of monopoly in the straits was forthwith\r\nabolished. The colony was restored to the Dutch, however, in 1818, but\r\nsix years later it came finally into the hands of Great Britain, being\r\nexchanged by a treaty with Holland for the East India Company's\r\nsettlement of Benkulen and a few other unimportant places on the western\r\ncoast of Sumatra. By this treaty the Dutch were precluded from\r\ninterference in the affairs of the Malay Peninsula, and Great Britain\r\nfrom similar action in regard to the States of Sumatra, with the sole\r\nexception of Achin, the right to protect that state being maintained by\r\nGreat Britain until 1872 when it was finally abandoned by a treaty\r\nconcluded with Holland in that year. The Dutch took advantage of this\r\nimmediately to invade Achin, and the strife begun in 1873 still\r\ncontinues and is now a mere war of extermination. It was not until 1833\r\nthat the whole territory lying at the back of Malacca was finally\r\nbrought under British control, and as late as 1887 the Negri Sembilan,\r\nor Nine States, which adjoin Malacca territory on the east and\r\nnorth-east, were completely independent. They to-day form part of the\r\nFederated Malay States, which are under the protection of Great Britain,\r\nand are governed with the assistance and by the advice of British\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nMalacca, in common with the rest of the Straits Settlements, was\r\nadministered by the government of India until 1867, when it became a\r\ncrown colony under the control of the Colonial Office. It is to-day\r\nadministered by a resident councillor, who is responsible to the\r\ngovernor of the Straits Settlements, and by a number of district\r\nofficers and other officials under his direction. The population of the\r\ntown and territory of Malacca in 1901 was 94,487, of whom 74 were\r\nEuropeans and Americans, 1598 were Eurasians, the rest being Asiatics\r\n(chiefly Malays with a considerable sprinkling of Chinese). The\r\npopulation in 1891 was 92,170, and the estimated population for 1905 was\r\n97,000. The birth-rate is about 35 per thousand, and the death-rate\r\nabout 29 per thousand. The trade of this once flourishing port has\r\ndeclined, most of the vessels being merely coasting craft, and no large\r\nline of steamers holding any communication with the place. This is due\r\npartly to the shallowness of the harbour, and partly to the fact that\r\nthe ports of Penang and Singapore, at either entrance to the straits,\r\ndraw all the trade and shipping to themselves. The total area of the\r\nsettlement is about 700 sq. m. The colony is wholly agricultural, and\r\nthe land is almost entirely in the hands of the natives. About 50,000\r\nacres are under tapioca, and about 9000 acres are under rubber\r\n(_hevea_). This cultivation is rapidly extending. There are still\r\nconsiderable areas unoccupied which are suitable for rubber and for\r\ncoco-nuts. The settlement is well opened up by roads; and a railway,\r\nwhich is part of the Federated Malay States railway system, has been\r\nconstructed from the town of Malacca to Tampin in the Negri Sembilan.\r\nThere is a good rest-house at Malacca and a comfortable seaside bungalow\r\nat Tanjong Kling, seven miles from the town. Malacca is 118 m. by sea\r\nfrom Singapore and 50 m. by rail from Seremban, the capital of the Negri\r\nSembilan. There is excellent snipe-shooting to be had in the vicinity of\r\nMalacca.\r\n\r\n  See _The Commentaries of d'Alboquerque_ (Hakluyt Society); _The\r\n  Voyages and Adventures of Fernand Mendez Pinto_ (London, 1653); _An\r\n  Account of the East Indies_, by Captain Alexander Hamilton (Edinburgh.\r\n  1727); Valentyn's _History of Malacca_, translated by Dudley Hervey;\r\n  _Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society_; \"Our\r\n  Tropical Possessions in Malayan India,\" by the same author, _ibid._;\r\n  _Further India_, by Hugh Clifford (London, 1904); _British Malaya_, by\r\n  Sir Frank Swettenham (London, 1906).     (H. Cl.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHI, the name assigned to the last book of the Old Testament in\r\nEnglish (the last of the \"prophets\" in the Hebrew Bible), which\r\naccording to the title (Mal. i. 1) contains the \"word of Yahweh to\r\nIsrael by the hand of Malachi.\" In form the word means \"my messenger.\"\r\nIt could be explained as a contraction of Malachiah, \"messenger of\r\nYahweh\"; but the Septuagint is probably right in not regarding it as a\r\nproper name (\"by the hand of His messenger\"). Not only do we know\r\nnothing from internal or external evidence of the existence of a prophet\r\nof this name,[1] but the occurrence of the word in the title is\r\nnaturally explained as derived from iii. 1: \"Behold, I send my\r\nmessenger\" (cf. ii. 7). The prophecy must, therefore, be regarded as\r\nanonymous; the title was added by the compiler who wrote similar\r\neditorial titles to the anonymous prophecies beginning Zech. ix. 1, xii.\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the prophecy fall into a series of clearly marked\r\nsections, as in the paragraph division of the Revised Version. These\r\napply, in various ways, the truth emphasized at the outset: Yahweh's\r\nlove for Israel in contrast with his treatment of Edom (i. 2-5).\r\nIsrael's response should be a proper regard for the ritual of His\r\nworship; yet any offering, however imperfect, is thought good enough for\r\nYahweh's altar (i. 6-14). Let the priests, who are responsible, take\r\nwarning, and return to their ancient ideals (ii. 1-9). Again, the common\r\nFatherhood of God should inspire a right relation among fellow\r\nIsraelites, not such conduct as the divorce of Israelite wives in order\r\nto marry non-Israelite women (ii. 10-16).[2] The prevalence of\r\nwrong-doing has provoked scepticism as to righteous judgment; but the\r\nmessenger of Yahweh is at hand to purge away indifferentism from worship\r\nand immorality from conduct (ii. 17-iii. 6). The payment of tithes now\r\nwithheld will be followed by the return of prosperity (iii. 7-12).\r\nReligion may seem useless, but Yahweh remembers His own, and will soon\r\nin open judgment distinguish them from the irreligious (iii. 13-iv. 3).\r\nThe book closes with an appeal to observe the law of Moses, and with a\r\npromise that Elijah shall come before the threatened judgment.[3]\r\n\r\nThe topics noticed clearly relate the prophecy to the period of Ezra and\r\nNehemiah, when the Temple had been rebuilt (i. 10; iii. 1, 10), the\r\nprovince of Judah was under a Persian governor (i. 8), and there had\r\nbeen time enough for the loss of earlier enthusiasm. The majority of\r\nmodern scholars are agreed that the prophet prepares for the work of\r\nthose reformers (Ezra, 458; Nehemiah, 444, 432 B.C.). The abuses of\r\nwhich he particularly complains are such as were found rampant by Ezra\r\nand Nehemiah--marriage with foreign women (ii. 11; cf. Ezra ix.; Neh.\r\nxiii. 23 seq.; Deut. vii. 3) and failure in payment of sacred dues (iii.\r\n8 seq.; cf. Neh. x. 34 seq.; xiii. 10 seq.; Deut. xxvi. 12 seq.). The\r\npriests have fallen into contempt (ii. 9) and have neglected what is\r\nstill one of their chief trusts, the oral law (ii. 6 seq.). The priestly\r\ncode of written law was not promulgated until 444 B.C. (Neh. viii.-x.);\r\n\"Malachi\" writes under the influence of the earlier Code of Deuteronomy\r\nonly,[4] and must therefore belong to a date prior to 444. The\r\nindependent character of the attack on current abuses also suggests\r\npriority to the work of Ezra in 458. The prophecy affords an interesting\r\nand valuable glimpse of the post-exilic community, with its various\r\ncurrents of thought and life. The completion of the second Temple (516\r\nB.C.) has been followed by disillusionment as to the anticipated\r\nprosperity, by indifference to worship, scepticism as to providence, and\r\nmoral laxity.[5] In view of these conditions, the prophet's message is\r\nto reassert the true relation of Israel to Yahweh, and to call for a\r\ncorresponding holiness, especially in regard to questions of ritual and\r\nof marriage. He saw that \"the disobedience of his time was the outcome\r\nof a lowered morality, not of a clearer spiritual vision.\"[6] A strong\r\nsense of the unique privileges of the children of Jacob, the objects of\r\nelecting love (i. 2), the children of the Divine Father (ii. 10), is\r\ncombined with an equally strong assurance of Yahweh's righteousness\r\nnotwithstanding the many miseries that pressed on the unhappy\r\ninhabitants of Judaea. At an earlier date the prophet Haggai had taught\r\nthat the people could not expect Yahweh's blessing while the Temple lay\r\nin ruins. In Malachi's time the Temple was built (i. 10) and the priests\r\nwaited in their office, but still a curse seemed to rest on the nation's\r\nlabours (iii. 9). To Malachi the reason of this is plain. The \"law of\r\nMoses\" was forgotten (iv. 4 [iii. 22]); let the people return to Yahweh,\r\nand He will return to them. It was in vain to complain, saying, \"Every\r\none that doeth evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh,\" or \"Where is the God\r\nof judgment?\"--vain to ask \"Wherein shall we return?\" Obedience to the\r\nlaw is the sure path to blessing (ii. 17-iii. 12).\r\n\r\nHe calls the people to repentance, and he enforces the call by\r\nproclaiming the approach of Yahweh in judgment against the sorcerers,\r\nthe adulterers, the false swearers, the oppressors of the poor, the\r\norphan and the stranger. Then it shall be seen that He is indeed a God\r\nof righteous judgment, distinguishing between those that serve Him and\r\nthose that serve Him not. The Sun of Righteousness shall shine forth on\r\nthose that fear Yahweh's name; they shall go forth with joy, and tread\r\nthe wicked under foot. The conception of the day of final decision, when\r\nYahweh shall come suddenly to His temple (iii. 1) and confound those who\r\nthink the presumptuous godless happy (iii. 15), is taken from earlier\r\nprophets, but is applied wholly within the Jewish nation. The day of\r\nYahweh would be a curse, not a blessing, if it found the nation in its\r\npresent state: the priests listlessly performing a fraudulent service\r\n(i. 7-ii. 9), the people bound by marriage to heathen women, while the\r\ntears of the daughters of Israel, thrust aside to make way for\r\nstrangers, cover the altar (ii. 11-16), all faith in divine justice gone\r\n(ii. 17; iii. 14 seq.), sorcery, uncleanness, falsehood and oppression\r\nrampant (iii. 5), the house of God deprived of its dues (iii. 8), and\r\nthe true fearers of God a little flock gathered together in private\r\nexercises of religion (perhaps the germ of the later synagogue) in the\r\nmidst of a godless nation (iii. 16). That the day of Yahweh is delayed\r\nin such a state of things is but a new proof of His unchanging love\r\n(iii. 6), which refuses to consume the sons of Jacob. Meantime He is\r\nabout to send His messenger to prepare His way before Him. The prophet\r\nElijah must reappear to bring back the hearts of fathers and children\r\nbefore the great and terrible day of Yahweh come. Elijah was the\r\nadvocate of national decision in the great concerns of Israel's\r\nreligion; and it is such decision, a clear recognition of what the\r\nservice of Yahweh means, a purging of His professed worshippers from\r\nhypocritical and half-hearted service (iii. 3) that Malachi with his\r\nintense religious earnestness sees to be the only salvation of the\r\nnation. In thus looking to the return of the ancient prophet to do the\r\nwork for which later prophecy is too weak, Malachi unconsciously\r\nsignalizes the decay of the order of which he was one of the last\r\nrepresentatives; and the somewhat mechanical measure which he applies to\r\nthe people's sins, as for example when he teaches that if the sacred\r\ndues were rightly paid prosperous seasons would at once return (iii.\r\n10), heralds the advent of that system of formal legalism which thought\r\nthat all religious duty could be reduced to a system of set rules. Yet\r\nMalachi himself is no mere formalist. To him, as to the Deuteronomic\r\nlegislation, the forms of legal observance are of value only as the\r\nfitting expression of Israel's peculiar sonship and service, and he\r\nshows himself a true prophet when he contrasts the worthless ministry of\r\nunwilling priests with the pure offering of prayer and praise that rises\r\nfrom the implicit monotheism of even Gentile worship[7] (i. 11), or when\r\nhe asserts the brotherhood of all Israelites under their one Father\r\n(ii. 10), not merely as a ground of separation from the heathen, but as\r\ninconsistent with the selfish and cruel freedom of divorce current in\r\nhis time.[8] The book is a significant landmark in the religious history\r\nof Israel. Its emphasis on the observance of ritual finds fullest\r\ndevelopment in the Priestly Code, subsequently promulgated; its protest\r\nagainst foreign marriages is made effective through the reforms of Ezra\r\nand Nehemiah;[9] the influence of its closing words on later expectation\r\nis familiar to every reader of the new Testament.[10]\r\n\r\nThe style of Malachi, like his argument, corresponds in its generally\r\nprosaic character to that transformation or decay of prophecy which\r\nbegan with Ezekiel; and Ewald rightly called attention to the fact that\r\nthe conduct of the argument already shows traces of the dialectic manner\r\nof the schools. Yet there is a simple dignity in the manner not unworthy\r\nof a prophet, and rising from time to time to poetical rhythm.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--Nowack, _Die kleinen Propheten_ (1897; 2nd ed., 1904);\r\n  Wellhausen, id.

(W. R. S.; H. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] A Hebrew tradition given in the Targum of Jonathan, and approved\r\n    by Jerome, identifies Malachi with Ezra the priest and scribe.\r\n\r\n  [2] Torrey (_Ency. Bib._ c. 2908) holds that the reference here is\r\n    purely figurative; \"Judah has dealt falsely with the wife of his\r\n    youth, the covenant religion, and is wedding a strange cult.\" But he\r\n    assigns the book to the 4th century.\r\n\r\n  [3] This closing prophecy may possibly be a later addition (so Marti)\r\n    rounding off the prophetic canon by reference to the two great names\r\n    of Moses and Elijah, and their characteristic activities. In this\r\n    case, \"Elijah\" will represent an early interpretation (cf. Ecclus.\r\n    xlviii. 10) of the \"messenger,\" originally conceived as a purely\r\n    ideal figure. The only other passage in the book whose originality is\r\n    not generally accepted is that referring to mixed marriages (ii. 11,\r\n    12).\r\n\r\n  [4] It is the Deuteronomic law that is most familiar to him, as\r\n    appears from his use of the name Horeb for the mountain of the law,\r\n    and the Deuteronomic phrase \"statutes and judgments\" (iv. 4), from\r\n    his language as to tithes and offerings (iii. 8, 10; cf. Deut. xii.\r\n    11; xxvi. 12), and especially from his conception of the priesthood\r\n    as resting on a covenant with Levi (ii. 4 seq.). Malachi indeed\r\n    assumes that the \"whole tithe\"--the Deuteronomic phrase for the tithe\r\n    in which the Levites shared--is not stored in each township, but\r\n    brought into the treasury at the Temple. But this was a modification\r\n    of the Deuteronomic law naturally called for under the circumstances\r\n    of the return from Babylon, and Neh. x. and xiii. produce the\r\n    impression that it was not introduced for the first time by Ezra and\r\n    Nehemiah, though the collection of the tithe was enforced by them.\r\n    See further, W.R.S. in _O.T.J.C._ ii. 425-427.\r\n\r\n  [5] Cf. Stade's reconstruction, _G.V.I._ ii. 128-138.\r\n\r\n  [6] Welch in _D.B._ iii. 220.\r\n\r\n  [7] This remarkable utterance is sometimes (as by W.R.S.) interpreted\r\n    of the worship of Jews scattered in the Dispersion: reasons for the\r\n    above view are given by Driver.\r\n\r\n  [8] In ii. 16 the Targum renders \"If thou hatest her put her away.\"\r\n    It is characteristic of later Judaism that an arbitrary exegesis\r\n    transformed the above anticipation of the doctrine of marriage laid\r\n    down in the gospel into an express sanction of the right of the\r\n    husband to put away his wife at will.\r\n\r\n  [9] \"The permanence of Judaism depended on the religious separateness\r\n    of the Jews\" (Ryle, _Ezra and Nehemiah_, p. 143).\r\n\r\n  [10] Matt. xvii. 3, 4, 10-13; xxvii. 47, 49; John i. 21, 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHITE, a copper-ore of fine green colour, sometimes polished as an\r\nornamental stone. The name is derived from Gr. [Greek: maláchê], the\r\nmallow, in allusion to the colour of the mineral being rather like that\r\nof the mallow-leaf. Malachite was perhaps one of the green minerals\r\ndescribed by Theophrastus under the general name of [Greek: smaragdos];\r\nand according to the late Rev. C. W. King it was probably the _smaragdus\r\nmedicus_ of Pliny, whilst his _molochites_ seems to have been a\r\ndifferent stone from our malachite and may have been a green jasper. It\r\nis suggested by J. L. Myres (_Ency. Bib._) that malachite may have been\r\nthe Heb. _soham_, of the high priest's breastplate.\r\n\r\nMalachite is a basic cupric carbonate, represented by the formula\r\nCuCO3Cu(HO)2, and has usually been formed by the action of meteoric\r\nagencies on other copper-minerals; hence it is found in the upper part\r\nof ore-deposits, often as an incrustation, and occasionally as a\r\npseudomorph after cuprite, chalcocite, &c. When formed, as commonly\r\nhappens, by the alteration of copper-pyrites the iron of this mineral\r\nusually takes the form of limonite, which may remain associated with the\r\nmalachite. Occasionally, though but rarely, malachite occurs in small\r\ndark-green prismatic crystals of the monoclinic system. Its usual mode\r\nof occurrence is in nodular or stalagmitic forms, with a mammillated,\r\nreniform or botryoidal surface, whilst in other cases it forms fibrous,\r\ncompact or even earthy masses. The nodules, though commonly dull on the\r\noutside, may display on fracture a beautiful zonary structure, the\r\nsuccessive layers often succeeding each other as curved deposits of\r\nlight and dark tints. The colours include various shades of apple-green,\r\ngrass-green, emerald-green and verdigris-green. Certain varieties\r\nexhibit a finely fibrous structure, producing on the fractured surface a\r\nsoft silky sheen.\r\n\r\nWhilst malachite is found in greater or less quantity in most\r\ncopper-mines, the finer varieties useful for ornamental purposes are of\r\nvery limited occurrence, and the lapidary has generally drawn his supply\r\nfrom Russia and Australia. The principal source in recent years has been\r\nthe Medno-Rudiansk mine near Nizhne Tagilsk, on the Siberian side of the\r\nUrals, but it was formerly obtained from mines near Bogoslovsk to the\r\nnorth and Gumishev to the south of this locality. A mass from Gumishev,\r\npreserved in the museum of the Mining Institute of St Petersburg weighs\r\n3240lb. and still larger masses have been found near Nizhne Tagilsk. The\r\nmineral is prized in Russia for use in mosaic-work, and for the\r\nmanufacture of vases, snuff-boxes and various ornamental objects. Even\r\nfolding doors, mantelpieces, table-tops and other articles of furniture\r\nhave been executed in malachite, the objects being veneered with thin\r\nslabs cleverly fitted together so as to preserve the pattern, and having\r\nthe interspaces filled up with fragments and powder of malachite applied\r\nwith a cement. The malachite is sawn into slabs, ground with emery and\r\npolished with tripoli. Its hardness is less than 4, but it takes a good\r\npolish like marble: it is rather denser than marble, having a specific\r\ngravity of 3.7 to 4, but it is more difficult to work, in consequence of\r\na tendency to break along the curved planes of deposition. Exceptionally\r\nfine examples of the application of malachite are seen in some of the\r\ncolumns of St Isaac's Cathedral in St Petersburg, which are hollow iron\r\ncolumns encrusted with malachite. Large masses of ornamental malachite\r\nhave been found in Australia, especially at the old Burra Burra\r\ncopper-mine in South Australia. The Copper Queen and other mines in\r\nArizona have yielded fine specimens of malachite associated with\r\nazurite, and polished slabs of the mixed minerals sometimes show the\r\nvivid green and the deep blue carbonate in very striking contrast. This\r\nnatural association, cut as an ornamental stone, has been named, by Dr\r\nG. F. Kunz, azurmalachite. Malachite is occasionally used for\r\ncameo-work, and some fine antique examples are known. It was formerly\r\nworn as an amulet to preserve the wearer from lightning, contagion and\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n  The mineral, when ground, has been used as a pigment under the name of\r\n  \"mountain green.\" The coarser masses are extensively used, with other\r\n  minerals, as ores of copper, malachite containing about 57% of metal.\r\n  \"Blue malachite\" is a name sometimes given to azurite (q.v.), whilst\r\n  \"siliceous malachite\" is a term inappropriately applied to chrysocolla\r\n  (q.v.).     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHOWSKI, STANISLAW (1736-1809), Polish statesman, the younger son of\r\nStanislaw Malachowski, palatine of Posen, the companion in arms of\r\nSobieski. From his youth Malachowski laboured zealously for the good of\r\nhis country, and as president of the royal court of justice won the\r\nhonourable title of the \"Polish Aristides.\" He was first elected a\r\ndeputy to the Coronation Diet of 1764, and the great Four Years' Diet\r\nunanimously elected him its speaker at the beginning of its session in\r\n1788. Accurately gauging the situation, Malachowski speedily gathered\r\nround him all those who were striving to uphold the falling republic and\r\nwarmly supported every promising project of reform. He was one of the\r\nframers of the constitution of the 3rd of May 1791, exceeding in\r\nliberality all his colleagues and advocating the extension of the\r\nfranchise to the towns and the emancipation of the serfs. He was the\r\nfirst to enter his name as a citizen of Warsaw in the civic register and\r\nto open negotiations with his own peasantry for their complete\r\nliberation. Disappointed in his hopes by the overthrow of the\r\nconstitution, he resigned office and left the country in 1792, going\r\nfirst to Italy and subsequently to his estates in Galicia, where he was\r\nimprisoned for a time on a false suspicion of conspiracy. In 1807\r\nMalachowski was placed at the head of the executive committee appointed\r\nat Warsaw after its evacuation by the Prussians, and when the grand\r\nduchy of Warsaw was created Malachowski became president of the senate\r\nunder King Frederick Augustus of Saxony. In the negotiations with the\r\nAustrian government concerning the Galician salt-mines Malachowski came\r\nto the assistance of the depleted treasury by hypothecating all his\r\nestates as an additional guarantee. In 1809 he died at Warsaw. His death\r\nwas regarded as a public calamity, and multitudes followed his remains\r\nto their last resting-place in the Church of the Holy Cross. In all the\r\nother towns of the grand duchy funeral services were held simultaneously\r\nas a tribute of the respect and gratitude of the Polish nation.\r\n\r\n  See August Sokolowski, _Illustrated History of Poland_ (Pol.), vol.\r\n  iv. (Vienna, 1900); _Life and Memoirs of S. Malachowski_, edited by\r\n  Lucyan Siemienski (Pol; Cracow, 1853).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHY, ST (c. 1094-1148), otherwise known as Maol-Maodhog (or\r\nMaelmaedhog) Ua Morgair, archbishop of Armagh and papal legate in\r\nIreland, was born at Armagh. His father, an Irish clergyman, the\r\n_Fearleighlinn_, or _lector_, at the university, was said to have been\r\nof noble family. Having been ordained to the priesthood, he for some\r\ntime acted as vicar of Archbishop Celsus or Ceallach of Armagh, and\r\ncarried out many reforms tending to increase conformity with the usage\r\nof the Church of Rome. In order to improve his knowledge of the Roman\r\nritual he spent four years with Malchus, bishop of Lismore (in Munster),\r\na strong advocate of Romanism. Here he became acquainted with Cormac\r\nMacCarthy, king of Desmond, who had sought refuge with Malchus, and,\r\nwhen he subsequently regained his kingdom, rendered great services to\r\nMalachy. On his return from Lismore, Malachy undertook the government of\r\nthe decayed monastery of Bangor (in Co. Down), but very soon afterwards\r\nhe was elected bishop of Connor (now a small village near Ballymena).\r\nAfter the sack of that place by the king of Ulster he withdrew into\r\nMunster; here he was kindly received by Cormac MacCarthy, with whose\r\nassistance he built the monastery of Ibrach (in Kerry). Meanwhile he had\r\nbeen designated by Celsus (in whose family the see of Armagh had been\r\nhereditary for many years) to succeed him in the archbishopric; in the\r\ninterests of reform he reluctantly accepted the dignity, and thus became\r\ninvolved for some years in a struggle with the so-called heirs. Having\r\nfinally settled the diocese, he was permitted, as had been previously\r\nstipulated by himself, to return to his former diocese, or rather to the\r\nsmaller and poorer portion of it, the bishopric of Down. Although the\r\nRoman party had by this time obtained a firm hold in the north of\r\nIreland, the organization of the Church had not yet received the\r\nsanction of the pope. Accordingly, in 1139, Malachy set out from Ireland\r\nwith the purpose of soliciting from the pope the pallium (the token of\r\narchiepiscopal subjection to Rome) for the archbishop of Armagh. On his\r\nway to Rome he visited Clairvaux, and thus began a lifelong friendship\r\nwith St Bernard. Malachy was received by Innocent II. with great honour,\r\nand made papal legate in Ireland, though the pope refused to grant the\r\npallium until it had been unanimously applied for \"by a general council\r\nof the bishops, clergy and nobles.\" On his way home Malachy revisited\r\nClairvaux, and took with him from there four members of the Cistercian\r\norder, by whom the abbey of Mellifont (in the county of Louth) was\r\nafterwards founded in 1141. For the next eight years after his return\r\nfrom Rome Malachy was active in the discharge of his legatine duties,\r\nand in 1148, at a synod of bishops and clergy held at Inis-Patrick (St\r\nPatrick's Island, near Skerries, Co. Dublin), he was commissioned to\r\nreturn to Rome and make fresh application for the pallium; he did not,\r\nhowever, get beyond Clairvaux, where he died in the arms of St Bernard\r\non the 2nd of November 1148. The object of his life was realized four\r\nyears afterwards, in 1152, during the legateship of his successor.\r\nMalachy was canonized by Clement III. in 1190.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Malachy in Irish ecclesiastical affairs has been\r\ncompared with that of Boniface in Germany. He reformed and reorganized\r\nthe Irish Church and brought it into subjection to Rome; like Boniface,\r\nhe was a zealous reformer and a promoter of monasticism. But perhaps his\r\nchief claim to distinction is that of having opened the first Cistercian\r\nmonastery in Ireland, five more being soon afterwards established.\r\nSeveral works are attributed to him, but are all probably spurious. The\r\nmost curious of these is a _Prophecy concerning the Future Roman\r\nPontiffs_, which has produced an extensive literature. It is now\r\ngenerally attributed to the year 1590, and is supposed to have been\r\nforged to support the election of Cardinal Simoncelli to the papal\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n  St Bernard's _Life_ of Malachy, and two sermons on his death will be\r\n  found in J. P. Migne, _Patrologia Latina_; clxxxii., clxxxiii.; see\r\n  also _Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters_, ed. J.\r\n  O'Donovan (Dublin, 1851); G.

III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACOSTRACA. Under this zoological title are included several groups of\r\nCrustacea (q.v.), united by characters which attest their common origin,\r\nthough some, and probably all of them, were already separated in distant\r\ngeological ages, and some have now attained a peculiar isolation.\r\nThroughout the whole, the researches made since 1860 have not only added\r\na great throng of new species, genera and families, but have thrown a\r\nflood of light upon questions of their phylogeny, systematic\r\narrangement, horizontal and bathymetric distribution, organization,\r\nhabits of life and economic importance. There are at least seven orders:\r\nthe stalk-eyed Brachyura, Macrura, Schizopoda, Stomatopoda, and the\r\nsessile-eyed Sympoda, Isopoda, Amphipoda. An ocular segment claimed by\r\nthe former division is not present or in no case demonstrable in the\r\nlatter. In neither does the terminal segment or telson, whether large or\r\nobsolescent, whether articulated or coalescent, carry appendages, unless\r\noccasionally in fusion with itself. Between the eyes and the tail-piece\r\nin all the orders nineteen segments are counted, the proof of a\r\nsegment's existence depending on its separateness, complete or partial,\r\nor on a sutural indication, or else on the pair of appendages known to\r\nbelong to it. All these marks may fail, and then the species must be\r\nproved to be Malacostracan by other evidence than the number of its\r\nsegments; but if some exceptions exhibit fewer, none of the Malacostraca\r\nexhibits more than 19 (+1 or + 2) segments, unless the Nebaliidae be\r\nincluded. Of the corresponding pairs of appendages thirteen belong to\r\nthe head and trunk, two pairs of antennae, one pair of mandibles, two\r\npairs of maxillae, followed by three which may be all maxillipeds or may\r\nhelp to swell the number of trunk-legs to which the next five pairs\r\nbelong. The abdomen or pleon carries the remaining six pairs, of which\r\nfrom three to five are called pleopods and the remainder uropods.\r\nUnderlying the diversity of names and functions and countless varieties\r\nof shape, there is a common standard to which the appendages in general\r\ncan be referred. In the maxillipeds and the trunk-legs it is common to\r\nfind or otherwise easy to trace a seven-jointed stem, the endopod, from\r\nwhich may spring two branches, the epipod from the first joint, the\r\nexopod from the second.[1] The first antennae are exceptional in\r\nbranching, if at all, at the third joint. In the mandibles and maxillae\r\nsome of the terminal joints of the stem are invariably wanting. In the\r\nrest of the appendages they may either be wanting or indistinguishable.\r\nThe latter obscurity results either from coalescence, to which all\r\njoints and segments are liable, or from subdivision, which occasionally\r\naffects joints even in the trunk-legs. The carapace, formerly referred\r\nonly to the antennar-mandibular segments, may perhaps in fact contain\r\nelements from any number of other segments of head and trunk, Huxley,\r\nAlcock, Bouvier giving support to this opinion by the sutural or other\r\ndivisional lines in _Potamobius_, _Nephrops_, _Thalassina_, and various\r\nfossil genera. Not all questions of classification internal to this\r\ndivision are yet finally settled. Between the Brachyura and Macrura some\r\nauthors uphold an order Anomura, though in a much restricted sense, the\r\nlabours of Huxley, Boas, Alcock and conjointly Alphonse Milne-Edwards\r\nand Bouvier, having resulted in restoring the Dromiidea and Raninidae to\r\nthe Brachyura, among which de Haan long ago placed them. The French\r\nauthors argue that from the macruran lobsters (_Nephropsidae_) anciently\r\ndiverged two lines: one leading through the Dromiidea to the genuine\r\nBrachyura; or crabs, the other independently to the Anomura proper,\r\nwhich may conveniently be named and classed as _Macrura anomala_. Spence\r\nBate maintained that the Schizopoda ought not to form a separate order,\r\nbut to be ranged as a macruran tribe, \"more nearly allied to the\r\ndegraded forms of the Penaeidea than to those of any other group\"\r\n(_\"Challenger\" Reports_, \"Macrura,\" p. 472, 1888). According to Sars,\r\nthe Sympoda (or Cumaceans), in spite of their sessile eyes, have closer\r\naffinities with the stalk-eyed orders. H. J. Hansen and others form a\r\ndistinct order Tanaidea for the decidedly anomalous group called by Sars\r\n_Isopoda chelifera_.\r\n\r\n  1. BRACHYURA.--For the present, as of old, the true Brachyura are\r\n  divided into four tribes: _Cyclometopa_, with arched front as in the\r\n  common eatable crab; _Catometopa_, with front bent down as in the\r\n  land-crabs and the little oyster-crab; _Oxyrhyncha_, with sharpened\r\n  beak-like front as in the various spider-crabs; _Oxystomata_,\r\n  including the Raninidae, and named not from the character of the front\r\n  but from that of the buccal frame which is usually narrowed forwards.\r\n  In these tribes the bold and active habits, the striking colours, or\r\n  the fantastic diversities of structure, have so long attracted remark\r\n  that recent investigations, while adding a multitude of new species\r\n  and supplying the specialist with an infinity of new details, have not\r\n  materially altered the scientific standpoint. New light, however, has\r\n  been thrown upon the \"intellectual\" capacity of Crustacea by the proof\r\n  that the spider-crabs deliberately use changes of raiment to harmonize\r\n  with their surroundings, donning and doffing various natural objects\r\n  as we do our manufactured clothes. Others have the power of producing\r\n  sounds, one use to which they put this faculty being apparently to\r\n  signal from their burrow in the sand that they are \"not at home\" to an\r\n  inopportune visitor. Deep-sea exploration has shown that some species\r\n  have an immensely extended range, and still more, that species of the\r\n  same genus, and genera of the same family, though separated by great\r\n  intervals of space, may be closely allied in character. A curious\r\n  effect of parasitism, well illustrated in crabs, though not confined\r\n  to them, has been expounded by Professor Giard, namely, that it tends\r\n  to obliterate the secondary sexual characters. Modern research has\r\n  discovered no crab to surpass _Macrocheira kämpferi_, De Haan, that\r\n  can span between three and four yards with the tips of its toes, but\r\n  at the other end of the scale it has yielded _Collodes malabaricus_,\r\n  Alcock, \"of which the carapace, in an adult and egg-laden female, is\r\n  less than one-sixth of an inch in its greatest diameter.\" The most\r\n  abyssal of all crabs yet known is _Ethusina abyssicola_, Smith, or\r\n  what is perhaps only a variety of it, _E. challengeri_, Miers. Of the\r\n  latter the \"Albatross\" obtained a specimen from a depth of 2232\r\n  fathoms (Faxon, 1895), of the former from 2221 fathoms, and of this S.\r\n  I. Smith remarks that it has \"distinctly faceted black eyes,\" although\r\n  in them \"there are only a very few visual elements at the tips of the\r\n  immobile eye-stalks.\"\r\n\r\n  The _Brachyura anomala_, or Dromiidea, \"have preserved the external\r\n  characters and probably also the organization of the Brachyura of the\r\n  Secondary epoch\" (Milne-Edwards and Bouvier, 1901). They agree with\r\n  the true crabs in not having appendages (uropods) to the sixth segment\r\n  of the pleon, the atrophy being complete in the Homolidae and\r\n  Homolodromiidae, whereas in the Dromiidae and Dynomenidae a pair of\r\n  small plates appear to be vestiges of these organs. In the family\r\n  Homolidae stands the strange genus _Latreillia_, Roux, with long\r\n  slender limbs and triangular carapace after the fashion of oxyrhynch\r\n  spider-crabs. In _Homola_ the carapace is quadrilateral. Between these\r\n  two a very interesting link was discovered by the \"Challenger\" in the\r\n  species _Latreillopsis bispinosa_. Henderson. Bouvier (1896) has shown\r\n  that _Palaeinachus longipes_, Woodward, from the Forest Marble of\r\n  Wiltshire, is in close relationship, not to the oxyrhynch Inachidae,\r\n  but to the genera _Homolodromia_ and _Dicranodromia_ of the\r\n  Homolodromiidae, and that the Jurassic crabs in general, of the family\r\n  Prosoponidae (Meyer), are Dromiidea.\r\n\r\n  2. MACRURA.--The _Macrura anomala_, or Anomura in restricted sense,\r\n  are popularly known through the hermit-crabs alone. These only\r\n  partially represent one of the three main divisions, Paguridea,\r\n  Galatheidea, Hippidea. The first of these is subdivided into\r\n  _Pagurinea_, _Lithodinea_, _Lomisinea_, each with a literature of its\r\n  own. Among the Pagurinea is the _Birgus latro_, or robber-crab, whose\r\n  expertness in climbing the coco-nut palm need no longer be doubted,\r\n  since in recent years it has been noted and photographed by\r\n  trustworthy naturalists in the very act. Alcock \"observed one of these\r\n  crabs drinking from a runnel of rain-water, by dipping the fingers of\r\n  one of its chelipeds into the water and then carrying the wet fingers\r\n  to its mouth.\" Hermits of the genus _Coenobita_ he found feeding\r\n  voraciously on nestling sea-terns. That pagurids must have the usually\r\n  soft pleon or abdomen protected by the shell of a mollusc is now known\r\n  to be subject to a multitude of exceptions. _Birgus_ dispenses with a\r\n  covering; _Coenobita_ can make shift with half the shell of a\r\n  coco-nut; _Chlaenopagurus_ wraps itself up in a blanket of colonial\r\n  polyps; _Cancellus tanneri_, Faxon, was found in a piece of dead coral\r\n  rock; _Xylopagurus rectus_, A. Milne-Edwards, lodges in tubes of\r\n  timber or bits of hollow reed. The last-named species has a straight\r\n  symmetrical abdomen, with the penultimate segment expanded and\r\n  strongly calcified to form a back-door to the very unconventional\r\n  habitation. This it enters head-foremost from the rear, while\r\n  \"hermits\" in general are forced to go backwards into their spiral or\r\n  tapering shelters by the front. Some of the species can live in the\r\n  ocean at a depth of two or three miles. Some can range inland up to a\r\n  considerable height on mountains. The advantage that this group has\r\n  derived from the adoption of mollusc shells as houses or fortresses,\r\n  ready built and light enough for easy transport, is obviously\r\n  discounted by a twofold inconvenience. There is nothing to ensure that\r\n  the supply will be equal to the demand, and Nature has not arranged\r\n  that the borrowed tenement shall continue to grow with the growth of\r\n  its new tenant. To meet these defects it is found that numerous\r\n  species encourage or demand the companionship of various zoophytes,\r\n  simple or colonial. These sometimes completely absorb the shell on\r\n  which they are settled, but then act as a substitute for it, and in\r\n  any case by their outgrowth they extend the limits of the dwelling, so\r\n  that the inmate can grow in comfort without having to hunt or fight\r\n  for a larger abode. Among the _Lithodinea_, or stone crabs, besides\r\n  important readjustments of classification (Bouvier, 1895, 1896),\r\n  should be noticed the evidence of their cosmopolitan range, and the\r\n  species _Neolithodes agassizii_ (Smith) and _N. grimaldii_,\r\n  Milne-Edwards and Bouvier, which carry to an extreme the spinosity\r\n  characteristic of the group (fig. 1). S. I. Smith's investigations on\r\n  the early stages of _Hippa talpoida_, Say, were published in 1877.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--_Neolithodes grimaldii_, A. Milne-Edwards and\r\n  Bouvier.]\r\n\r\n  With regard to the accessions to knowledge in the enormous group of\r\n  the genuine Macrura, reference need only be made to the extensive\r\n  reports in which Spence Bate, S. I. Smith, Faxon, Wood-Mason, Alcock,\r\n  and others have made known the results of celebrated explorations.\r\n  Various larval stages have been successfully investigated by Sars.\r\n  Alcock (1901) describes from his own observation the newly hatched\r\n  _Phyllosoma_ larva of _Thenus orientalis_, Fabricius. An admirable\r\n  discrimination of the larval and adult characters of the genus\r\n  _Sergestes_ has been given by H. J. Hansen (_Proc. Zool. Soc._,\r\n  London, 1896). Singularity excites our wonder in _Thaumastocheles\r\n  zaleucus_, v. Willemoes Suhm, which makes up for its vanished eyes by\r\n  its extraordinarily elongate and dentated claws; in _Psalidopus\r\n  huxleyi_, Wood-Mason and Alcock (1892), bristling with spikes from\r\n  head to tail; in the Nematocarcinidae, with their long thread-like\r\n  limbs and longer antennae; in species of _Aristaeopsis_ reported by\r\n  Chun from deep water off the east coast of Africa, bright red prawns\r\n  nearly a foot long, with antennae about five times the length of the\r\n  body. That certain species, particularly many from deep water, have\r\n  disproportionately large eggs, is explained by the supposition that\r\n  the young derive the advantage of being hatched in an advanced stage\r\n  of development.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--_Anaspides tasmaniae_, Thomson.]\r\n\r\n  3. SCHIZOPODA.--This order of animals for the most part delicately\r\n  beautiful, has for the moment five families--Lophogastridae,\r\n  Eucopiidae, Euphausiidae, Mysidae and Anaspididae. In the Euphausiidae\r\n  the digitiform-arborescent branchiae, as if conscious of their own\r\n  extreme elegance, remain wholly uncovered. In the two preceding\r\n  families they are partially covered. In the Mysidae the branchiae are\r\n  wanting, and some would form this family into a separate order,\r\n  Mysidacea. In _Anaspides_, a peculiar fresh-water genus discovered in\r\n  1892 by G. M. Thomson on Mount Wellington, in Tasmania, the gills are\r\n  not arborescent, and there are seven segments of the trunk free of the\r\n  carapace (fig. 2). A membranaceous carapace separates the Eucopiidae\r\n  from the more solidly invested Lophogastridae. Among many papers that\r\n  the student will find it necessary to consult may be mentioned the\r\n  \"_Challenger_\" _Report_ on Schizopoda, by Sars, 1885, dealing with\r\n  the order at large; \"British Schizopoda,\" by Norman _Ann. Nat. Hist._\r\n  (1892); \"Decapoden und Schizopoden,\" _Plankton-Expedition_ (Ortmann,\r\n  1893); \"Euphausiidae,\" by Stebbing, _Proc. Zool. Soc._ (London, 1900);\r\n  _Mysidae of the Russian Empire_, by Czerniavski (1882-1883); and\r\n  _Mysidae of the Caspian_, by Sars (1893-1895-1897).\r\n\r\n  4. STOMATOPODA.--This order, at one time a medley of heterogeneous\r\n  forms, is now confined to the singularly compact group of the\r\n  Squillidae. Here the articulation of the ocular segment is unusually\r\n  distinct, and here two characters quite foreign to all the preceding\r\n  groups come into view. The second maxillipeds are developed into\r\n  powerful prehensile organs, and the branchiae, instead of being\r\n  connected with the appendages of head and trunk, are developed on the\r\n  pleopods, appendages of the abdomen. At least three segments of the\r\n  trunk are left uncovered by the carapace. The developing eggs are not\r\n  carried about by the mother, but deposited in her subaqueous burrow,\r\n  \"where they are aerated by the currents of water produced by the\r\n  abdominal feet of the parent.\" An excellent synopsis of the genera and\r\n  species is provided by R. P. Bigelow (_Proc. U.S. Mus._ vol. xvii.,\r\n  1894). For the habits and peculiarities of these and many other\r\n  Crustaceans, A. E. Verrill and S. I. Smith on the _Invertebrates of\r\n  Vineyard Sound_ should be consulted (1874). The general subject has\r\n  been illuminated by the labours of Claus, Miers, Brooks (_\"Challenger\"\r\n  Report_, 1886), and the latest word on the relationship between the\r\n  various larvae and their respective genera has been spoken by H. J.\r\n  Hansen (_Plankton-Expedition Report_, 1895). The striking forms of\r\n  _Alima_ and _Erichthus_, at one time regarded as distinct genera, are\r\n  now with more or less certainty affiliated to their several squillid\r\n  parents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--_Pseudocuma pectinatum_, Sowinsky.]\r\n\r\n  5. SYMPODA.--This order of sessile-eyed decapods was absolutely\r\n  unknown to science till 1779. A species certainly belonging to it was\r\n  described by Lepekhin in 1780, but the obscure _Gammarus esca_, \"food\r\n  Gammarus\" beloved of herrings, described by J. C. Fabricius in the\r\n  preceding year, may also be one of its members. Nutritious\r\n  possibilities are implied in _Diastylis rathkii_, Kröyer, one of the\r\n  largest forms, which, though slender and rarely an inch long, in its\r\n  favourite Arctic waters is found \"in incalculable masses, in thousands\r\n  of specimens\" (Stuxberg, 1880). Far on in the 19th century eminent\r\n  naturalists were still debating whether in this group there were eyes\r\n  or no eyes, whether the eyes were stalked or sessile, whether the\r\n  animals observed were larval or adult. The American T. Say in 1818\r\n  gave a good description of a new species and founded the premier genus\r\n  _Diastylis_, but other investigators derived little credit from the\r\n  subject till more than sixty years after its introduction by the\r\n  Russian Lepekhin. Then Goodsir, Kröyer, Lilljeborg, Spence Bate and\r\n  one or two others made considerable advances, and in 1865 a memorable\r\n  paper by G. O. Sars led the way to the great series of researches\r\n  which he has continued to the present day. The name _Cumacea_,\r\n  however, which he uses cannot be retained, being founded on the\r\n  preoccupied name _Cuma_ (Milne-Edwards, 1828). The more recent name\r\n  _Sympoda_ (see Willey, _Results_, pt. v. p. 609, 1900) alludes to the\r\n  huddling together of the legs, which is conspicuous in most of the\r\n  species. Ten families are now distinguished--Diastylidae, Lampropidae,\r\n  Platyaspidae, Pseudocumidae, all with an articulated telson; without\r\n  one, the Bodotriidae (formerly called _Cumidae_), Vaunthompsoniidae,\r\n  Leuconidae, Nannastacidae, Campylaspidae, Procampylaspidae. All the\r\n  Leuconidae and Procampylaspidae are blind, and some species in most of\r\n  the other families. Usually the sides of the carapace are strangely\r\n  produced into a mock rostrum in front of the ocular lobe, be it\r\n  oculiferous or not. The last four or five segments of the trunk are\r\n  free from the carapace. The slender pleon has always six distinct\r\n  segments, the sixth carrying two-branched uropods, the preceding five\r\n  armed with no pleopods in the female, whereas in the male the number\r\n  of pairs varies from five to none. The resemblance of these creatures\r\n  to miniature Macrura is alluded to in the generic name _Nannastacus_,\r\n  meaning dwarf-lobster. In this genus alone of the known Sympoda the\r\n  eyes sometimes form a pair, in accordance with the custom of all other\r\n  malacostracan orders except this and of this order itself in the\r\n  embryo (Sars, 1900). The most but not the only remarkable character\r\n  lies in the first maxillipeds. These, with the main stem more or less\r\n  pediform, have the epipod and exopod modified for respiratory\r\n  purposes. The backward-directed epipods usually carry branchial\r\n  vesicles. The forward-directed exopods either act as valves or form a\r\n  tube (rarely two tubes), protensile and retractile, for regulating\r\n  egress of water from the branchial regions. This mechanism as a whole\r\n  is unique, although, as Sars observes, the epipod of the first\r\n  maxillipeds has a respiratory function also in the Lophogastridae and\r\n  Mysidae and in the cheliferous isopods. As a rule armature of the\r\n  carapace is much more developed in the comparatively sedentary female\r\n  than in the usually more active male. Only in the male do the second\r\n  antennae attain considerable length, with strong resemblance to what\r\n  is found in some of the Amphipoda. About 150 species distributed among\r\n  thirty-four genera are now known, many from shallow water and from\r\n  between tide-marks, some from very great depths. H. J. Hansen\r\n  concludes that \"they are all typically ground animals, and as yet no\r\n  species has been taken under such conditions that it could be reckoned\r\n  to the pelagic plankton.\" As they have been found in all zones and\r\n  chiefly by a very few observers, it is probable that a great many more\r\n  species remain to be discovered. In recent years thirteen species, all\r\n  belonging to the same genus _Pseudocuma_ (fig. 3), have been recorded\r\n  by Sars from the Caspian Sea. A bibliography of the order is given in\r\n  that author's _Crustacea of Norway_, vol. iii. (1899-1900).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.--_Rhabdosoma piratum_, Stebbing.]\r\n\r\n  6. ISOPODA.--This vast and populous order can be traced far back in\r\n  geological time. It is now represented in all seas and lands, in\r\n  fresh-water lakes and streams, and even in warm springs. It adapts\r\n  itself to parasitic life not only in fishes, but in its own class\r\n  Crustacea, and that in species of every order, its own included. In\r\n  this process changes of structure are apt to occur, and sometimes\r\n  unimaginable sacrifices of the normal appearance. The order has been\r\n  divided into seven tribes, of which a fuller summary than can here be\r\n  given will be found in Stebbing, _History of Crustacea_ (1893). The\r\n  first tribe, called Chelifera, from the usually chelate or\r\n  claw-bearing first limbs, may be regarded as _Isopoda anomala_, of\r\n  which some authors would form a separate order, Tanaidea. Like the\r\n  genuine isopods, they have seven pairs of trunk-legs, but instead of\r\n  having seven segments of the middle body (or peraeon) normally free,\r\n  they have the first one or two of its segments coalesced with the\r\n  head. Instead of the breathing organs being furnished by the\r\n  appendages of the pleon with the heart in their vicinity, the\r\n  respiration is controlled by the maxillipeds, with the heart in the\r\n  peraeon (see Delage, _Arch. Zool. expér. et gén._, vol. ix., 1881).\r\n  There are two families, Tanaidae and Apseudidae. Occasionally the\r\n  ocular lobes are articulated.\r\n\r\n  The genuine Isopoda are divided among the _Flabellifera_, in which the\r\n  terminal segment and uropods form a flabellum or swimming fan; the\r\n  _Epicaridea_, parasitic on Crustaceans; the _Valvifera_, in which the\r\n  uropods fold valve-like over the branchial pleopods; the _Asellota_,\r\n  in which the first pair of pleopods of the female are usually\r\n  transformed into a single opercular plate; the _Phreatoicidea_, a\r\n  fresh-water tribe, known as yet only from subterranean waters in New\r\n  Zealand and an Australian swamp nearly 6000 ft. above sea-level; and\r\n  lastly, the _Oniscidea_, which are terrestrial. Only the last of\r\n  these, under the contemptuous designation of wood-lice, has\r\n  established a feeble claim to popular recognition. Few persons hear\r\n  without surprise that England itself possesses more than a score of\r\n  species in this air-breathing tribe. Those known from the world at\r\n  large number hundreds of species, distributed among dozens of genera\r\n  in six families. That a wood-louse and a land-crab are alike\r\n  Malacostracans, and that they have by different paths alike become\r\n  adapted to terrestrial life, are facts which even a philosopher might\r\n  condescend to notice. Of the other tribes which are aquatic there is\r\n  not space to give even the barest outline. Their swarming multitudes\r\n  are of enormous importance in the economy of the sea. If in their\r\n  relation to fish it must be admitted that many of them plague the\r\n  living and devour the dead, in return the fish feed rapaciously upon\r\n  them. Among the most curious of recent discoveries is that relating to\r\n  some of the parasitic _Cymothoidae_, as to which Bullar has shown that\r\n  the same individual can be developed first as a male and then as a\r\n  female. Of lately discovered species the most striking is one of the\r\n  deep-sea Cirolanidae, _Bathynomus giganteus_, A. M. Edwards (1879),\r\n  which is unique in having supplementary ramified branchiae developed\r\n  at the bases of the pleopods. Its eyes are said to contain nearly 4000\r\n  facets. The animal attains what in this order is the monstrous size of\r\n  9 in. by 4. A general uniformity of the trunk-limbs in Isopoda\r\n  justifies the ordinal name, but the valviferous Astacillidae, and\r\n  among the Asellota the Munnopsidae, offer some remarkable exceptions\r\n  to this characteristic. Among many essential works on this group may\r\n  be named the _Monogr. Cymothoarum_ of Schiödte and Meinert\r\n  (1879-1883); \"_Challenger_\" _Report_, Beddard (1884-1886);\r\n  _Cirolanidae_, H. J. Hansen (1890); _Isopoda Terrestria_, Budde-Lund\r\n  (1885); _Bopyridae_, Bonnier (1900); _Crustacea of Norway_, vol. ii.\r\n  (Isopoda), Sars (1896-1899), while their multitude precludes\r\n  specification of important contributions by Benedict, Bovallius,\r\n  Chilton, Dohrn, Dollfus, Fraisse, Giard and Bonnier, Harger, Haswell,\r\n  Kossmann, Miers, M'Murrich, Norman, Harriet Richardson, Ohlin, Studer,\r\n  G. M. Thomson, A. O. Walker, Max Weber and many others.\r\n\r\n  7. AMPHIPODA.--As in the genuine Isopoda, the eyes of Amphipoda are\r\n  always sessile, and generally paired, and, in contrast to crabs and\r\n  lobsters, these two groups have only four pairs of mouth-organs\r\n  instead of six, but seven pairs of trunk-legs instead of five. From\r\n  the above-named isopods the present order is strongly differentiated\r\n  by having heart and breathing organs not in the pleon, but in the\r\n  peraeon, or middle body, the more or less simple branchial vesicles\r\n  being attached to some or all of the last six pairs of trunk-legs.\r\n  Normally the pleon carries six pairs of two-branched appendages, of\r\n  which the first three are much articulated flexible swimming feet, the\r\n  last three few-jointed comparatively indurated uropods. There are\r\n  three tribes, _Gammaridea_, _Caprellidea_, _Hyperiidea_. The middle\r\n  one contains but two families, the cylindrical and often thread-like\r\n  skeleton shrimps, Caprellidae, and their near cousins, the broad,\r\n  flattened, so-called whale-lice, Cyamidae. This tribe has the pleon\r\n  dwindled into insignificance, whereas in the other two tribes it is\r\n  powerfully developed. The Hyperiidea are distinguished by having their\r\n  maxillipeds never more than three-jointed. In the companion tribes\r\n  these appendages have normally seven joints, and always more than\r\n  three. The order thus sharply divided is united by an intimate\r\n  interlacing of characters, and forms a compact whole at present\r\n  defying intrusion from any other crustacean group. Since 1775, when J.\r\n  C. Fabricius instituted the genus _Gammarus_ for five species, of\r\n  which only three were amphipods, while he left five other amphipods in\r\n  the genus _Oniscus_, from this total of eight science has developed\r\n  the order, at first very slowly, but of late by great leaps and\r\n  bounds, so that now the _Gammaridea_ alone comprise more than 1300\r\n  species, distributed among some 300 genera and 39 families. They\r\n  burrow in the sands of every shore; they throng the weeds between\r\n  tide-marks; they ascend all streams; they are found in deep wells, in\r\n  caverns, in lakes; in Arctic waters they swarm in numbers beyond\r\n  computation; they find lodgings on crabs, on turtles, on weed-grown\r\n  buoys; they descend into depths of the ocean down to hundreds or\r\n  thousands of fathoms; they are found in mountain streams as far above\r\n  sea-level as some of their congeners live below it. The Talitridae,\r\n  better known as sandhoppers, can forgo the briny shore and content\r\n  themselves with the damp foliage of inland forests or casual humidity\r\n  in the crater of an extinct volcano. Over the ocean surface, as well\r\n  as at various depths, float and swim innumerable _Hyperiidea_--the\r\n  wonderful _Phronima_, glass-like in its glassy barrel hollowed out of\r\n  some Tunicate; the _Cystisoma_, 4 or 5 in. long, with its eye-covered\r\n  head; the _Rhabdosoma_, like a thin rod of glass, with needle-like\r\n  head and tail, large eyes, but limbs and mouth-organs all in\r\n  miniature, and the second antennae of the male folding up like a\r\n  carpenter's rule (fig. 4). On jelly-fishes are to be found species of\r\n  _Hyperia_ and their kindred, so fat and wholesome that they have been\r\n  commended to shipwrecked men in open boats as an easily procurable\r\n  resource against starvation. Many of the Amphipoda are extremely\r\n  voracious. Some of them are even cannibals. The Cyamidæ afflict the\r\n  giant whale by nibbling away its skin; the _Chelura terebrans_ is\r\n  destructive to submerged timber. But, on the other hand, they largely\r\n  help to clear the sea and other waters of refuse and carrion, and for\r\n  fishes, seals and whales they are food desirable and often\r\n  astoundingly copious. From the little flea-like species, scarcely a\r\n  tenth of an inch long, up to the great and rare but cosmopolitan\r\n  _Eurythenes gryllus_, Lichtenstein, and the still larger _Alicella\r\n  gigantea_, Chevreux, nearly half a foot long, captured by the prince\r\n  of Monaco from a depth of 2936 fathoms, not one of these ubiquitous,\r\n  uncountable hordes has ever been accused of assailing man. For the\r\n  naturalist they have the recommendation that many are easy to obtain,\r\n  that most, apart from the very minute, are easy to handle, and that\r\n  all, except as to the fleeting colours, are easy to preserve.\r\n\r\n  A nearly complete bibliography of the order down to 1888 will be found\r\n  in the \"_Challenger_\" _Reports_, vol. xxviii., and supplementary\r\n  notices in Della Valle's _Monograph of the Gammarini_ (1893), the\r\n  scope of his work, however, not covering the Hyperiidea and\r\n  Oxycephalidae of Bovallius (1889, 1890); but since these dates very\r\n  numerous additions to the literature have been made by Birula,\r\n  Bonnier, Norman, Walker and others, especially the _Crustacea of\r\n  Norway_, vol. i. (_Amphipoda_), Sars (1890-1895), demanding attention,\r\n  and the quite recent _Amphipoda of the Hirondelle_, Chevreux (1900),\r\n  and _Hyperiidea of the Plankton-Expedition_, Vosseler (1901).\r\n       (T. R. R. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] In Huxley's terminology the first two or three joints of the stem\r\n    constitute a \"protopodite,\" from which spring the \"endopodite\" and\r\n    \"exopodite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAGA, a maritime province of southern Spain, one of the eight modern\r\nsubdivisions of Andalusia; bounded on the W. by Cadiz, N. by Seville and\r\nCordova, E. by Granada, and S. by the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. (1900),\r\n511,989; area, 2812 sq. m. The northern half of Malaga belongs to the\r\ngreat Andalusian plain watered by the Guadalquivir, the southern is\r\nmountainous, and rises steeply from the coast. Of the numerous sierras\r\nmay be mentioned that of Alhama, separating the province from Granada,\r\nand at one point rising above 7000 ft.; its westward continuation in the\r\nSierra de Abdalajis and the Axarquia between Antequera and Malaga; and\r\nnot far from the Cadiz boundary the Sierras de Ronda, de Mijas, de Tolox\r\nand Bermeja, converging and culminating in a summit of nearly 6500 ft.\r\nThe rivers which rise in the watershed formed by all these ranges reach\r\nthe sea after a short and precipitous descent, and in rainy seasons are\r\nvery liable to overflow their banks. In 1907 great loss of life and\r\ndestruction of property were caused in this manner. The principal river\r\nis the Guadalhorce, which rises in the Sierra de Alhama, and, after a\r\nwesterly course past the vicinity of Antequera, bends southward through\r\nthe wild defile of Peñarrubia and the beautiful _vega_ or vale of\r\nMalaga, falling into the sea near that city. The only other considerable\r\nstream is the Guadiaro, which has the greater part of its course within\r\nthe province and flows past Ronda. There is an extensive salt lagoon\r\nnear the northern boundary. The mountains are rich in minerals, lead,\r\nand (in the neighbourhood of Marbella) iron, being obtained in large\r\nquantities. There are warm sulphurous springs and baths at Carratraca.\r\nThough the methods of agriculture are for the most part rude, the yield\r\nof wheat in good seasons is considerably in excess of the local demand;\r\nand large quantities of grapes and raisins, oranges and lemons, figs and\r\nalmonds, are annually exported. The oil and wines of Malaga are also\r\nhighly esteemed, and after 1870 the manufacture of beet and cane sugar\r\ndeveloped into an important industry. In 1905 there were about 500 flour\r\nmills and 230 oil factories beside 95 stills and 100 wine-presses in the\r\nprovince. Malaga has suffered severely from the agricultural depression\r\nprevalent throughout southern Spain, but its manufacturing industries\r\ntend to expand. The fisheries are important; a fleet of about 300 boats\r\nbrings in 18,000,000 lb. annually, of which 25% is exported. The\r\ninternal communications are in many parts defective, owing to the broken\r\nnature of the surface; but the province is traversed from north to south\r\nby the Cordova-Malaga railway, which sends off branches from Bobadilla\r\nto Granada and Algeciras. A branch line along the coast from Malaga to\r\nVélez Malaga was opened in 1908.\r\n\r\n  Malaga, the capital (pop. 130,109), Antequera (31,609), Vélez Malaga\r\n  (23,586), Ronda (20,995), Coín (12,326), and Alora (10,325), are\r\n  described in separate articles. Other towns with more than 7000\r\n  inhabitants are Marbella (9629), Estepona (9310), Archidona (8880) and\r\n  Nerja (7112). The population of the province tends gradually to\r\n  decrease, as many families emigrate to South America, Algeria and\r\n  Hawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAGA, the capital of the province of Malaga, an episcopal see, and,\r\nnext to Barcelona, the most important seaport of Spain, finely situated\r\non the Mediterranean coast, at the southern base of the Axarquia hills\r\nand at the eastern extremity of the fertile vega (plain) of Malaga in\r\n36° 43´ N. and 4° 25´ W. Pop. (1900), 130,109. From the clearness of its\r\nsky, and the beautiful sweep of its bay, Malaga has sometimes been\r\ncompared with Naples. The climate is one of the mildest and most equable\r\nin Europe, the mean annual temperature being 66.7° Fahr. The principal\r\nrailway inland gives access through Bobadilla to all parts of Spain, and\r\na branch line along the coast to Vélez-Malaga was opened in 1908. Malaga\r\nlies principally on the left bank of a mountain torrent, the\r\nGuadalmedina (\"river of the city\"); the streets near the sea are\r\nspacious and comparatively modern, but those in the older part of the\r\ntown, where the buildings are huddled around the ancient citadel, are\r\nnarrow, winding and often dilapidated. Well-built suburbs have also\r\nspread on all sides into the rich and pleasant country which surrounds\r\nMalaga, and several acres of land reclaimed from the sea have been\r\nconverted into a public park. There are various squares or plazas and\r\npublic promenades; of the former the most important are the Plaza de\r\nRiego (containing the monument to General José Maria Torrijos, who, with\r\nforty-eight others, was executed in Malaga on the 11th of December 1831,\r\nfor promoting an insurrection in favour of the constitution) and the\r\nPlaza de la Constitucion; adjoining the quays is the fine Paseo de la\r\nAlameda. The city has no public buildings of commanding architectural or\r\nhistorical importance. The cathedral, on the site of an ancient mosque,\r\nwas begun about 1528; after its construction had been twice interrupted,\r\nit was completed to its present state in the 18th century, and is in\r\nconsequence an obtrusive record of the degeneration of Spanish\r\narchitecture. The woodwork of the choir, however, is worthy of\r\nattention. The church of El Cristo de la Victoria contains some relics\r\nof the siege of 1487. There are an English church and an English\r\ncemetery, which dates from 1830; up to that year all Protestants who\r\ndied in Malaga were buried on the foreshore, where their bodies were\r\nfrequently exposed by the action of wind and sea. Of the old Moorish\r\narsenal only a single horseshoe gateway remains, the rest of the site\r\nbeing chiefly occupied by an iron structure used as a market; the\r\nAlcazába, or citadel, has almost disappeared. The castle of Gibralfaro,\r\non a bold eminence to the north-east dates from the 13th century, and is\r\nstill in fairly good preservation.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century so much silt accumulated in the harbour that\r\nvessels were obliged to lie in the roads outside, and receive and\r\ndischarge cargo by means of lighters; but new harbour works were\r\nundertaken in 1880, and large ships can now again load or discharge at\r\nthe quays, which are connected with the main railway system by a branch\r\nline. About 2150 ships of 1,750,000 tons enter at Malaga every year.\r\nIron, lead, wine, olive oil, almonds, fresh and dried fruit, palmetto\r\nhats and canary seed are exported in large quantities, while the imports\r\ninclude grain, codfish, fuel, chemicals, iron and steel, machinery,\r\nmanures and staves for casks. Although trade was impeded during the\r\nearly years of the 20th century by a succession of bad harvests and by\r\nthe disastrous floods of September 1907, the number of industries\r\ncarried on in and near Malaga tends steadily to increase. There are\r\nlarge cotton mills, iron foundries, smelting works and engineering\r\nworks. Pottery, mosaic, artificial stone and tiles are produced chiefly\r\nfor the home market, though smaller quantities are sent abroad. There is\r\na chromo-lithographic establishment, and the other industries include\r\ntanning, distilling and the manufacture of sugar, chocolate, soap,\r\ncandles, artificial ice, chemical products, white lead and pianos.\r\nForeign capital has played a prominent part in the development of\r\nMalaga; a French syndicate owns the gas-works, and the electric lighting\r\nof the streets is controlled by British and German companies.\r\n\r\nMalaga is the [Greek: Málaka] of Strabo (iii. 156) and Ptolemy (ii. 4,\r\n7) and the _Malaca foederatorum_ of Pliny (iii. 3). The place seems to\r\nhave been of some importance even during the Carthaginian period; under\r\nthe Romans it became a municipium, and under the Visigoths an episcopal\r\nsee. In 711 it passed into the possession of the Moors, and soon came to\r\nbe regarded as one of the most important cities of Andalusia. It was\r\nattached to the caliphate of Cordova, but on the fall of the Omayyad\r\ndynasty it became for a short time the capital of an independent\r\nkingdom; afterwards it was dependent on Granada. In 1487 it was taken\r\nand treated with great harshness by Ferdinand and Isabella after a\r\nprotracted siege. In 1810 it was sacked by the French under General\r\nSebastiani. The citizens of Malaga are noted for their opposition to the\r\nMadrid government; they took a prominent part in the movements against\r\nEspartero (1843), against Queen Isabella (1868) and in favour of a\r\nrepublic (1873).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAKAND PASS, a mountain pass in the North-West Province of India,\r\nconnecting the British district of Peshawar with the Swat Valley. It is\r\nnow a military post and the headquarters of a political agency. It came\r\ninto prominence for the first time in 1895 during the Chitral campaign,\r\nwhen 7000 Pathans held it against Sir Robert Low's advance, but were\r\neasily routed. After the campaign was over a fortified camp was formed\r\non the Malakand to guard the road to Chitral. During the frontier\r\nrisings of 1897 the Swatis made a determined attack on the Malakand,\r\nwhere 700 were killed, and on the adjacent post of Chakdara, where 2000\r\nwere killed. This was the origin of the Malakand Expedition of the same\r\nyear. (See SWAT.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALALAS (or MALELAS) (Syriac for \"orator\"), JOHN (c. 491-578), Byzantine\r\nchronicler, was born at Antioch. He wrote a [Greek: Chronographia] in 18\r\nbooks, the beginning and the end of which are lost. In its present state\r\nit begins with the mythical history of Egypt and ends with the\r\nexpedition to Africa under Marcianus, the nephew of Justinian. Except\r\nfor the history of Justinian and his immediate predecessors, it\r\npossesses little historical value; it is written without any idea of\r\nproportion and contains astonishing blunders. The writer is a supporter\r\nof Church and State, an upholder of monarchical principles. The work is\r\nrather a chronicle written round Antioch, which he regarded as the\r\ncentre of the world, and (in the later books) round Constantinople. It\r\nis, however, important as the first specimen of a chronicle written not\r\nfor the learned but for the instruction of the monks and the common\r\npeople, in the language of the vulgar, with an admixture of Latin and\r\nOriental words. It obtained great popularity, and was conscientiously\r\nexploited by various writers until the 11th century, being translated\r\neven into the Slavonic languages. It is preserved in an abridged form in\r\na single MS. now at Oxford.\r\n\r\n  For the authorities consulted by Malalas, the influence of his work on\r\n  Slavonic and Oriental literature, the state of the text, the original\r\n  form and extent of the work, the date of its composition, the relation\r\n  of the concluding part to the whole, and the literature of the\r\n  subject, see C. Krumbacher's _Geschichte der byzantinischen\r\n  Litteratur_ (1897). See also the _editio princeps_, by E. Chilmead\r\n  (Oxford, 1691), containing an essay by Humphrey Hody and Bentley's\r\n  well-known letter to Mill; other editions in the Bonn _Corpus\r\n  scriptorum hist. byz._, by L. Dindorf (1831), and in J. P. Migne\r\n  _Patrologia graeca_, xcvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAN, SOLOMON CAESAR (1812-1894), British divine and orientalist, was\r\nby birth a Swiss descended from an exiled French family, and was born at\r\nGeneva on the 22nd of April 1812, where his father, Dr Henry Abraham\r\nCaesar Malan (1787-1864) enjoyed a great reputation as a Protestant\r\ndivine. From his earliest youth he manifested a remarkable faculty for\r\nthe study of languages, and when he came to Scotland as tutor in the\r\nmarquis of Tweeddale's family at the age of 18 he had already made\r\nprogress in Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew. In 1833 he matriculated at St\r\nEdmund Hall, Oxford; and English being almost an unknown tongue to him,\r\nhe petitioned the examiners to allow him to do his paper work of the\r\nexamination in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin or Greek, rather\r\nthan in English. But his request was not granted. After gaining the\r\nBoden and the Pusey and Ellerton scholarships, he graduated 2nd class in\r\n_Lit. hum._ in 1837. He then proceeded to India as classical lecturer at\r\nBishop's College, Calcutta, to which post he added the duties of\r\nsecretary to the Bengal branch of the Royal Asiatic Society; and\r\nalthough compelled by illness to return in 1840, laid the foundation of\r\na knowledge of Tibetan and Chinese. After serving various curacies, he\r\nwas presented in 1845 to the living of Broadwindsor, Dorset, which he\r\nheld until 1886. During this entire period he continued to augment his\r\nlinguistic knowledge, which he carried so far as to be able to preach in\r\nthat most difficult language, Georgian, on a visit which he paid to\r\nNineveh in 1872. His translations from the Armenian, Georgian and Coptic\r\nwere numerous. He applied his Chinese learning to the determination of\r\nimportant points connected with Chinese religion, and published a vast\r\nnumber of parallel passages illustrative of the Book of Proverbs. In\r\n1880 the university of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree\r\nof D.D. No modern scholar, perhaps, has so nearly approached the\r\nlinguistic omniscience of Mezzofanti; but, like Mezzofanti, Dr Malan was\r\nmore of a linguist than a critic. He made himself conspicuous by the\r\nvehemence of his opposition to Westcott and Hort's text of the New\r\nTestament, and to the transliteration of Oriental languages, on neither\r\nof which points did he in general obtain the suffrages of scholars. His\r\nextensive and valuable library, some special collections excepted, was\r\npresented by him in his lifetime to the Indian Institute at Oxford. He\r\ndied at Bournemouth on the 25th of November 1894. His life has been\r\nwritten by his son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMÄLAR, a lake of Sweden, extending 73 m. westward from Stockholm, which\r\nlies at its junction with the Saltsjö, an arm of the Baltic Sea. The\r\nheight of the lake is normally only from 11 in. to 2 ft. above\r\nsea-level, and its outflow is sometimes reversed. The area is 449 sq. m.\r\nThe bottom consists of a series of basins separate by ridges from which\r\nrise numerous islands. The deepest sounding is 210 ft. The outline is\r\nvery irregular, the mean breadth being about 15 m., but an arm extends\r\nnorthward for 30 m. nearly to the city of Upsala with many\r\nramifications. The area of the drainage basin is 8789 sq. m., of which\r\n1124 are occupied by lakes. The navigable connexions with the lake\r\nare--(1) with lake Hjelmar to the south-west by the Arboga river and the\r\nHjelmar canal; and by the Eskilstuna river and the Thorshälla canal; (2)\r\nwith the Baltic southward through the Södertelge canal, the route\r\nfollowed by the Göta canal steamers; (3) with the Baltic by two channels\r\nat Stockholm. The more important towns, besides Stockholm, are Vesterås\r\non the north, Södertelge and Eskilstuna near the south shore. The lake\r\noffers a field for recreation fully appreciated by the inhabitants of\r\nthe capital, and many of those whose business lies at Stockholm have\r\ntheir residences on the shores of Mälar. On Drottningholm (Queen's\r\nIsland, named from Catherine, wife of John III.) is a palace with a fine\r\npark and formal gardens. John III. built a palace at the close of the\r\n16th century, but the existing building, by Nicodemus Tessin and his son\r\nNicodemus, dates from the second half of the 17th century. At Mariefred\r\non the south shore there is the castle of Gripsholm (1537), built by\r\nGustavus Vasa, a picturesque erection with four towers, richly adorned\r\nwithin, and containing a large collection of portraits. Strengnäs, on\r\nthe same shore, became an episcopal see in 1291, when the fine\r\ncathedral, much altered since, was consecrated. In the episcopal palace,\r\na building of the 15th century now used as a school, Gustavus Vasa was\r\nelected to the throne of Sweden in 1523. On the northward arm of the\r\nlake is the palace of Rosenberg, used as a school of gunnery, in a\r\nwell-wooded park. On a branch of the same arm is Sigtuna, a village\r\nwhose ruined churches are a memorial of its rank among the principal\r\ntowns of Sweden after its foundation in the 11th century. Remains prove\r\nthat on Björkö, an island in the eastern part of the lake, there was a\r\nlarge settlement of earlier importance than Sigtuna. Here a cross\r\ncommemorates the preaching of Christianity by St Ansgar in 829. Finally,\r\non the northern arm about 10 m. south of Upsala, there is the château of\r\nSkokloster, occupying the site of a monastery, and presented by Gustavus\r\nAdolphus to Marshal Herman Wrangel, whose son Charles Gustavus Wrangel\r\nstored it with a remarkable collection of trophies from Germany, taken\r\nduring the Thirty Years' War; including a library, an armoury, and a\r\ngreat accumulation of curios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALARIA, an Italian colloquial word (from _mala_, bad, and _aria_, air),\r\nintroduced into English medical literature by Macculloch (1827) as a\r\nsubstitute for the more restricted terms \"marsh miasm\" or \"paludal\r\npoison.\" It is generally applied to the definite unhealthy condition of\r\nbody known by a variety of names, such as ague, intermittent (and\r\nremittent) fever, marsh fever, jungle fever, hill fever, \"fever of the\r\ncountry\" and \"fever and ague.\" A single paroxysm of simple ague may come\r\nupon the patient in the midst of good health or it may be preceded by\r\nsome malaise. The ague-fit begins with chills proceeding as if from the\r\nlower part of the back, and gradually extending until the coldness\r\novertakes the whole body. Tremors of the muscles more or less violent\r\naccompany the cold sensations, beginning with the muscles of the lower\r\njaw (chattering of the teeth), and extending to the extremities and\r\ntrunk. The expression has meanwhile changed: the face is pale or livid;\r\nthere are dark rings under the eyes; the features are pinched and sharp,\r\nand the whole skin shrunken; the fingers are dead white, the nails blue.\r\n\r\nAll those symptoms are referable to spasmodic constriction of the small\r\nsurface arteries, the pulse at the wrist being itself small, hard and\r\nquick. In the interior organs there are indications of a compensating\r\naccumulation of blood, such as swelling of the spleen, engorgement (very\r\nrarely rupture) of the heart, with a feeling of oppression in the\r\nchest, and a copious flow of clear and watery urine from the congested\r\nkidneys. The body temperature will have risen suddenly from the normal\r\nto 103° or higher. This first or cold stage of the paroxysm varies much\r\nin length; in temperate climates it lasts from one to two hours, while\r\nin tropical and subtropical countries it may be shortened. It is\r\nfollowed by the stage of dry heat, which will be prolonged in proportion\r\nas the previous stage is curtailed. The feeling of heat is at first an\r\ninternal one, but it spreads outwards to the surface and to the\r\nextremities; the skin becomes warm and red, but remains dry; the pulse\r\nbecomes softer and more full, but still quick; and the throbbings occur\r\nin exposed arteries, such as the temporal. The spleen continues to\r\nenlarge; the urine is now scanty and high-coloured; the body temperature\r\nis high, but the highest temperatures occur during the chill; there is\r\nconsiderable thirst; and there is the usual intellectual unfitness, and\r\nit may be confusion, of the feverish state. This period of dry heat,\r\nhaving lasted three or four hours or longer, comes to an end in\r\nperspiration, at first a mere moistness of the skin, passing into\r\nsweating that may be profuse and even drenching. Sleep may overtake the\r\npatient in the midst of the sweating stage, and he awakes, not without\r\nsome feeling of what he has passed through, but on the whole well, with\r\nthe temperature fallen almost or altogether to the normal, or it may be\r\neven below the normal; the pulse moderate and full; the spleen again of\r\nits ordinary size; the urine that is passed after the paroxysm deposits\r\na thick brick-red sediment of urates. The three stages together will\r\nprobably have lasted six to twelve hours. The paroxysm is followed by a\r\ndefinite interval in which there is not only no fever, but even a fair\r\ndegree of bodily comfort and fitness; this is the intermission of the\r\nfever. Another paroxysm begins at or near the same hour next day\r\n(quotidian ague), which results from a double tertian infection, or the\r\ninterval may be forty-eight hours (tertian ague), or seventy-two hours\r\n(quartan ague). It is the general rule, with frequent exceptions, that\r\nthe quotidian paroxysm comes on in the morning, the tertian about noon,\r\nand the quartan in the afternoon. Another rule is that the quartan has\r\nthe longest cold stage, while its paroxysm is shortest as a whole; the\r\nquotidian has the shortest cold stage and a long hot stage, while its\r\nparoxysm is longest as a whole. The point common to the various forms of\r\nague is that the paroxysm ceases about midnight or early morning.\r\nQuotidian intermittent is on the whole more common than tertian in hot\r\ncountries; elsewhere the tertian is the usual type, and quartan is only\r\noccasional.\r\n\r\nIf the first paroxysm should not cease within the twenty-four hours, the\r\nfever is not reckoned as an intermittent, but as a remittent.\r\n\r\n  _Remittent_ is a not unusual form of the malarial process in tropical\r\n  and subtropical countries, and in some localities or in some seasons\r\n  it is more common than intermittent. It may be said to arise out of\r\n  that type of intermittent in which the cold stage is shortened while\r\n  the hot stage tends to be prolonged. A certain abatement or remission\r\n  of the fever takes place, with or without sweating, but there is no\r\n  true intermission or interval of absolute apyrexia. The periodicity\r\n  shows itself in the form of an exacerbation of the still continuing\r\n  fever, and that exacerbation may take place twenty-four hours after\r\n  the first onset, or the interval may be only half that period, or it\r\n  may be double. A fever that is to be remittent will usually declare\r\n  itself from the outset: it begins with chills, but without the\r\n  shivering and shaking fit of the intermittent; the hot stage soon\r\n  follows, presenting the same characters as the prolonged hot stage of\r\n  the quotidian, with the frequent addition of bilious symptoms, and it\r\n  may be even of jaundice and of tenderness over the stomach and liver.\r\n  Towards morning the fever abates; the pulse falls in frequency, but\r\n  does not come down to the normal; headache and aching in the loins and\r\n  limbs become less, but do not cease altogether; the body temperature\r\n  falls, but does not touch the level of apyrexia. The remission or\r\n  abatement lasts generally throughout the morning; and about noon there\r\n  is an exacerbation, seldom ushered in by chills, which continues till\r\n  the early morning following, when it remits or abates as before. A\r\n  patient with remittent may get well in a week under treatment, but the\r\n  fever may go on for several weeks; the return to health is often\r\n  announced by the fever assuming the intermittent type, or, in other\r\n  words, by the remissions touching the level of absolute apyrexia.\r\n  Remittent fevers (as well as intermittents) vary considerably in\r\n  intensity; some cases are intense from the outset, or pernicious, with\r\n  aggravation of all the symptoms--leading to stupor, delirium,\r\n  collapse, intense jaundice, blood in the stools, blood and albumen in\r\n  the urine, and, it may be, suppression of urine followed by\r\n  convulsions. The severe forms of intermittent are most apt to occur in\r\n  the very young, or in the aged, or in debilitated persons generally.\r\n  Milder cases of malarial fever are apt to become dangerous from the\r\n  complications of dysentery, bronchitis or pneumonia. Severe remittents\r\n  (pernicious or bilious remittents) approximate to the type of yellow\r\n  fever (q.v.), which is conventionally limited to epidemic outbreaks in\r\n  western longitudes and on the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nOf the mortality due to malarial disease a small part only is referable\r\nto the direct attack of intermittent, and chiefly to the fever in its\r\npernicious form. Remittent fever is much more fatal in its direct\r\nattack. But probably the greater part of the enormous total of deaths\r\nset down to malaria is due to the _malarial cachexia_. The dwellers in a\r\nmalarious region like the Terai (at the foot of the Himalayas) are\r\nmiserable, listless and ugly, with large heads and particularly\r\nprominent ears, flat noses, tumid bellies, slender limbs and sallow\r\ncomplexions; the children are impregnated with malaria from their birth,\r\nand their growth is attended with aberrations from the normal which\r\npractically amount to the disease of rickets. The malarial cachexia that\r\nfollows definite attacks of ague consists in a state of ill-defined\r\nsuffering, associated with a sallow skin, enlarged spleen and liver, and\r\nsometimes with dropsy.\r\n\r\n_Causation._--From the time of Hippocrates onwards the malarial or\r\nperiodical fevers have engaged the attention of innumerable observers,\r\nwho have suggested various theories of causation, and have sometimes\r\nanticipated--vaguely, indeed, but with surprising accuracy--the results\r\nof modern research; but the true nature of the disease remained in doubt\r\nuntil the closing years of the 19th century. It has now been\r\ndemonstrated by a series of accurate investigations, contributed by many\r\nworkers, that malaria is caused by a microscopic parasite in the blood,\r\ninto which it is introduced by the bites of certain species of mosquito.\r\n(See PARASITIC DISEASES and MOSQUITOES.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  History of Discovery.\r\n\r\nThe successive steps by which the present position has been reached form\r\nan interesting chapter in the history of scientific progress. The first\r\nsubstantial link in the actual chain of discovery was contributed in\r\n1880 by Laveran, a French army surgeon serving in Algeria. On the 6th of\r\nNovember in that year he plainly saw the living parasites under the\r\nmicroscope in the blood of a malarial patient, and he shortly afterwards\r\ncommunicated his observations to the Paris Académie de Médecine. They\r\nwere confirmed, but met with little acceptance in the scientific world,\r\nwhich was preoccupied with the claims of a subsequently discredited\r\nBacillus malariae. In 1885 the Italian pathologists came round to\r\nLaveran's views, and began to work out the life history of his\r\nparasites. The subject has a special interest for Italy, which is\r\ndevastated by malaria, and Italian science has contributed materially to\r\nthe solution of the problem. The labours of Golgi, Marchiafava, Celli\r\nand others established the nature of the parasite and its behaviour in\r\nthe blood; they proved the fact, guessed by Rasori so far back as 1846,\r\nthat the periodical febrile paroxysm corresponds with the development of\r\nthe organisms; and they showed that the different forms of malarial\r\nfever have their distinct parasites, and consequently fall into distinct\r\ngroups, defined on an etiological as well as a clinical basis--namely,\r\nthe mild or spring group, which includes tertian and quartan ague, and\r\nthe malignant or \"aestivo-autumnal\" group, which includes a tertian or a\r\nsemi-tertian and the true quotidian type. Three distinct parasites,\r\ncorresponding with the tertian, quartan and malignant types of fever,\r\nhave been described by Italian observers, and the classification is\r\ngenerally accepted; intermediate types are ascribed to mixed and\r\nmultiple infections. So far, however, only half the problem, and from\r\nthe practical point of view the less important half, had been solved.\r\nThe origin of the parasite and its mode of introduction into the blood\r\nremained to be discovered. An old popular belief current in different\r\ncountries, and derived from common observation, connected mosquitoes\r\nwith malaria, and from time to time this theory found support in more\r\nscientific quarters on general grounds, but it lacked demonstration and\r\nattracted little attention. In 1894, however, Sir Patrick Manson,\r\narguing with greater precision by analogy from his own discovery of the\r\ncause of filariasis and the part played by mosquitoes, suggested that\r\nthe malarial parasite had a similar intermediate host outside the human\r\nbody, and that a suctorial insect, which would probably be found to be a\r\nparticular mosquito, was required for its development. Following up this\r\nline of investigation, Major Ronald Ross in 1895 found that if a\r\nmosquito sucked blood containing the parasites they soon began to throw\r\nout flagellae, which broke away and became free; and in 1897 he\r\ndiscovered peculiar pigmented cells, which afterwards turned out to be\r\nthe parasites of aestivo-autumnal malaria in an early stage of\r\ndevelopment, within the stomach-wall of mosquitoes which had been fed on\r\nmalarial blood. He further found that only mosquitoes of the genus\r\n_Anopheles_ had these cells, and that they did not get them when fed on\r\nhealthy blood. Then, turning his attention to the malaria of birds, he\r\nworked out the life-history of these cells within the body of the\r\nmosquito. \"He saw that they increased in size, divided, and became full\r\nof filiform spores, then ruptured and poured out their multitudinous\r\nprogeny into the body-cavity of their insect host. Finally, he saw the\r\nspores accumulate within the cells of the salivary glands, and\r\ndiscovered that they actually passed down the salivary ducts and along\r\nthe grooved hypopharynx into the seat of puncture, thus causing\r\ninfection in a fresh vertebrate host\" (Sambon). To apply these\r\ndiscoveries to the malaria of man was an obvious step. In working out\r\nthe details the Italian school have again taken a prominent part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Experiment.\r\n\r\nThus we get a complete scientific demonstration of the causation of\r\nmalaria in three stages: (1) the discovery of the parasite by Laveran;\r\n(2) its life-history in the human host and connexion with the fever\r\ndemonstrated by the Italian observers; (3) its life-history in the\r\nalternate host, and the identification of the latter with a particular\r\nspecies of mosquito by Ross and Manson. The conclusions derived from the\r\nmicroscopical laboratory were confirmed by actual experiment. In 1898 it\r\nwas conclusively shown in Italy that if a mosquito of the _Anopheles_\r\nvariety bites a person suffering from malaria, and is kept long enough\r\nfor the parasite to develop in the salivary gland, and is then allowed\r\nto bite a healthy person, the latter will in due time develop malaria.\r\nThe converse proposition, that persons efficiently protected from\r\nmosquito bites escape malaria, has been made the subject of several\r\nremarkable experiments. One of the most interesting was carried out in\r\n1900 for the London School of Tropical Medicine by Dr Sambon and Dr Low,\r\nwho went to reside in one of the most malarious districts in the Roman\r\nCampagna during the most dangerous season. Together with Signor Terzi\r\nand two Italian servants, they lived from the beginning of July until\r\nthe 19th of October in a specially protected hut, erected near Ostia.\r\nThe sole precaution taken was to confine themselves between sunset and\r\nsunrise to their mosquito-proof dwelling. All escaped malaria, which was\r\nrife in the immediate neighbourhood. Mosquitoes caught by the\r\nexperimenters, and sent to London, produced malaria in persons who\r\nsubmitted themselves to the bites of these insects at the London School\r\nof Tropical Medicine. Experiments in protection on a larger scale, and\r\nunder more ordinary conditions, have been carried out with equal success\r\nby Professor Celli and other Italian authorities. The first of these was\r\nin 1899, and the subjects were the railwaymen employed on certain lines\r\nrunning through highly malarious districts. Of 24 protected persons, all\r\nescaped but four, and these had to be out at night or otherwise\r\nneglected precautions; of 38 unprotected persons, all contracted malaria\r\nexcept two, who had apparently acquired immunity. In 1900 further\r\nexperiments gave still better results. Of 52 protected persons on one\r\nline, all escaped except two, who were careless; of 52 protected on\r\nanother line, all escaped; while of 51 unprotected persons, living in\r\nalternate houses, all suffered except seven. Out of a total of 207\r\npersons protected in these railway experiments, 197 escaped. In two\r\npeasants' cottages in the Campagna, protected with wire netting by\r\nProfessor Celli, all the inmates--10 in number--escaped, while the\r\nneighbours suffered severely; and three out of four persons living in a\r\nthird hut, from which protection was removed owing to the indifference\r\nof the inmates, contracted malaria. In the malarious islet of Asinara a\r\npond of stagnant water was treated with petroleum and all windows were\r\nprotected with gauze. The result was that the houses were free from\r\nmosquitoes and no malaria occurred throughout the entire season, though\r\nthere had been 40 cases in the previous year. Eight Red Cross\r\nambulances, each with a doctor and attendant, were sent into the most\r\nmalarious parts of the Campagna in 1900. By living in protected houses\r\nand wearing gloves and veils at night all the staff escaped malaria\r\nexcept one or two attendants. These and other experiments, described by\r\nDr Manson in the _Practitioner_ for March 1900, confirming the\r\nlaboratory evidence as they do, leave no doubt whatever of the\r\ncorrectness of the mosquito-parasitic theory of malaria.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, though not probable, that malaria may also be contracted\r\nin some other way than by mosquito bite, but there are no\r\nwell-authenticated facts which require any other theory for their\r\nexplanation. The alleged occurrence of the disease in localities free\r\nfrom mosquitoes or without their agency is not well attested; its\r\nabsence from other localities where they abound is accounted for by\r\ntheir being of an innocent species, or--as in England--free from the\r\nparasite. The old theory of paludism or of a noxious miasma exhaled from\r\nthe ground is no longer necessary. The broad facts on which it is based\r\nare sufficiently accounted for by the habits of mosquitoes. For\r\ninstance, the swampy character of malarial areas is explained by their\r\nbreeding in stagnant water; the effect of drainage, and the general\r\nimmunity of high-lying, dry localities, by the lack of breeding\r\nfacilities; the danger of the night air, by their nocturnal habits; the\r\ncomparative immunity of the upper storeys of houses, by the fact that\r\nthey fly low; the confinement of malaria to well-marked areas and the\r\ndiminution of danger with distance, by their habit of clinging to the\r\nbreeding-grounds and not flying far. Similarly, the subsidence of\r\nmalaria during cold weather and its seasonal prevalence find an adequate\r\nexplanation in the conditions governing insect life. At the same time it\r\nshould be remembered that many points await elucidation, and it is\r\nunwise to assume conclusions in advance of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Parasites.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the parasites, which are the actual cause of malaria in\r\nman, an account of them is given under the heading of PARASITIC\r\nDISEASES, and little need be said about them here. They belong to the\r\ngroup of Protozoa, and, as already explained, have a double cycle of\r\nexistence: (1) a sexual cycle in the body of the mosquito, (2) an\r\nasexual cycle in the blood of human beings. They occupy and destroy the\r\nred corpuscles, converting the haemoglobin into melanin; they multiply\r\nin the blood by sporulation, and produce accessions of fever by the\r\nliberation of a toxin at the time of sporulation (Ross). The number in\r\nthe blood in an acute attack is reckoned by Ross to be not less than 250\r\nmillions. A more general and practical interest attaches to the insects\r\nwhich act as their intermediate hosts. These mosquitoes or gnats--the\r\nterms are synonymous--belong to the family _Culicidae_ and the genus\r\n_Anopheles_, which was first classified by Meigen in 1818. It has a wide\r\ngeographical distribution, being found in Europe (including England),\r\nAsia Minor, Burma, Straits Settlements, Java, China, Formosa, Egypt;\r\nwest, south and Central Africa; Australia, South America, West Indies,\r\nUnited States and Canada, but is generally confined to local centres in\r\nthose countries. About fifty species are recognized at present. It is\r\nbelieved that all of them may serve as hosts of the parasite. The\r\nspecies best known in connexion with malaria are _A. maculipennis_\r\n(Europe and America), _A. funestus_ and _A. costales_ (Africa). In\r\ncolour _Anopheles_ is usually brownish or slaty, but sometimes buff, and\r\nthe thorax frequently has a dark stripe on each side. The wings in\r\nnearly all species have a dappled or speckled appearance, owing to the\r\noccurrence of blotches on the front margin and to the arrangement of the\r\nscales covering the veins in alternating light and dark patches\r\n(Austen). The genus with which _Anopheles_ is most likely to be\r\nconfounded is _Culex_, which is the commonest of all mosquitoes, has a\r\nworld-wide distribution, and is generally a greedy blood-sucker. A\r\ndistinctive feature is the position assumed in resting; _Culex_ has a\r\nhumpbacked attitude, while in _Anopheles_ the proboscis, head and body\r\nare in a straight line, and in many species inclined at an angle to the\r\nwall, the tail sticking outwards. In the female of _Culex_ the palpi are\r\nmuch shorter than the proboscis; in _Anopheles_ they are of the same\r\nlength. The wings in _Culex_ have not the same dappled appearance.\r\n_Anopheles_ is also a more slender insect, with a smaller head, narrower\r\nbody and thinner legs. There are further differences in the other stages\r\nof life. Mosquitoes go through four phases: (1) ovum, (2) larva, (3)\r\nnympha, (4) complete insect. The ova of _Anopheles_ are tiny black\r\nrod-shaped objects, which are deposited on the water of natural puddles,\r\nponds, or slowly moving streams, by preference those which are well\r\nsupplied with vegetation; they float, singly or attached to other\r\nobjects or clustered together in patterns. They can live in brackish and\r\neven in sea water. The larva has no breathing-tube, and floats\r\nhorizontally at the surface, except when feeding; it does not frequent\r\nsewage or foul water. The ova of _Culex_, on the other hand, are\r\ndeposited in any stagnant water, including cesspools, drains, cisterns,\r\nor water collected in any vessel; they float in boat-shaped masses on\r\nthe surface. The larva has a breathing-tube, and floats head downwards;\r\nwhen disturbed it wriggles to the bottom (Christy). Some observers\r\nmaintain that _Anopheles_ does not \"sing,\" like the common mosquito, and\r\nits bite is much less irritating. Only the females suck blood; the act\r\nis believed to be necessary for fertilization and reproduction.\r\n_Anopheles_ rarely bites by day, and then only in dark places. In the\r\ndaytime \"the gorged females rest motionless on the walls and ceilings of\r\nrooms, choosing always the darkest situations for this purpose\"\r\n(Austen). In temperate climates the impregnated females hibernate during\r\nthe winter in houses, cellars, stables, the trunks of trees, &c., coming\r\nout to lay their eggs in the spring. The four phases are passed in\r\nthirty days in a favourable season, and consequently there are\r\nordinarily four or five generations from April to September (Celli).\r\n\r\nThe most important question raised by the mosquito-parasitic theory of\r\nmalaria is that of prevention. This may be considered under two heads:\r\n(1) individual prophylaxis; (2) administrative prevention on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prophylaxis.\r\n\r\n(1) In the first place, common sense suggests the avoidance, in\r\nmalarious countries, of unhealthy situations, and particularly the\r\nneighbourhood of stagnant water. Among elements of unhealthiness is next\r\nto be reckoned the proximity of native villages, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich are infected. In the tropics \"no European house should be located\r\nnearer to a native village than half a mile\" (Manson), and, since\r\nchildren are almost universally infected, \"the presence of young natives\r\nin the house should be absolutely interdicted\" (Manson). When unhealthy\r\nsituations cannot be avoided, they may be rendered more healthy by\r\ndestroying the breeding-grounds of mosquitoes in the neighbourhood. All\r\npuddles and collections of water should be filled in or drained; as a\r\ntemporary expedient they may be treated with petroleum, which prevents\r\nthe development of the larvae. When a place cannot be kept free from\r\nmosquitoes the house may be protected, as in the experiments in Italy,\r\nby wire gauze at the doors and windows. The arrangement used for the\r\nentrance is a wire cage with double doors. Failing such protection\r\nmosquito curtains should be used. Mosquitoes in the house may be\r\ndestroyed by the fumes of burning sulphur or tobacco smoke. According to\r\nthe experiments of Celli and Casagrandi, these are the most effective\r\nculicides; when used in sufficient quantity they kill mosquitoes in one\r\nminute. The same authorities recommend a powder, composed of larvicide\r\n(an aniline substance), chrysanthemum flowers, and valerian root, to be\r\nburnt in bedrooms. Anointing the skin with strong-smelling substances is\r\nof little use in the open air, but more effective in the house;\r\nturpentine appears to be the best. Exposure at night should be avoided.\r\nAll these prophylactic measures are directed against mosquitoes. There\r\nremains the question of protection against the parasite. Chills are\r\nrecognized as predisposing both to primary infection and to relapses,\r\nand malnutrition is also believed to increase susceptibility; both\r\nshould therefore be avoided. Then a certain amount of immunity may be\r\nacquired by the systematic use of quinine. Manson recommends five to ten\r\ngrains once or twice a week; Ross recommends the same quantity every day\r\nbefore breakfast. There is some evidence that arsenic has a prophylactic\r\neffect. An experiment made on the railway staff at Bovino, a highly\r\nmalarious district on the Adriatic, gave a striking result. The number\r\nof persons was 78, and they were divided into two equal groups of 39\r\neach. One group was treated with arsenic, and of these 36 escaped\r\naltogether, while three had mild attacks; the remaining 39 who were not\r\ntreated, all had fever. In a more extended experiment on 657 railwaymen\r\n402 escaped. This was in 1889; but in spite of the encouraging results\r\nthe use of arsenic does not appear to have made any further progress.\r\nExperiments in immunizing by sero-therapeutic methods have not as yet\r\nmet with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Administrative Measures.\r\n\r\n(2) Much attention has been directed in scientific circles to the\r\npossibility of \"stamping out\" epidemic malaria by administrative\r\nmeasures. The problem is one of great practical importance, especially\r\nto the British Empire. There are no data for estimating the damage\r\ninflicted by malaria in the British colonies. It is, indeed, quite\r\nincalculable. In Italy the annual mortality from this cause averages\r\n15,000, which is estimated to represent two million cases of sickness\r\nand a consequent loss of several million francs. In British tropical\r\npossessions the bill is incomparably heavier. There is not only the\r\nheavy toll in life and health exacted from Europeans, but the virtual\r\nclosing of enormous tracts of productive country which would otherwise\r\nafford scope for British enterprise. The \"deadly\" climates, to which so\r\nmuch dread attaches, generally mean malaria, and the mastery of this\r\ndisease would be equivalent to the addition of vast and valuable areas\r\nto the empire. The problem, therefore, is eminently one for the\r\nstatesman and administrator. A solution may be sought in several\r\ndirections, suggested by the facts already explained. The existence of\r\nthe parasite is maintained by a vicious interchange between its\r\nalternate hosts, mosquitoes and man, each infecting the other. If the\r\ncycle be broken at any point the parasite must die out, assuming that it\r\nhas no other origin or mode of existence. The most effective step would\r\nobviously be the extermination of the _Anopheles_ mosquito. A great deal\r\nmay be done towards this end by suppressing their breeding-places, which\r\nmeans the drying of the ground. It is a question for the engineer, and\r\nmay require different methods in different circumstances. Put\r\ncomprehensively, it involves the control of the subsoil and surface\r\nwaters by drainage, the regulation of rivers and floods, suitable\r\nagriculture, the clearing of forests or jungles, which tend to increase\r\nthe rainfall and keep the ground swampy.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rome is an example of what can be done by drainage; situated\r\nin the midst of malaria, it is itself quite healthy. Recent reports also\r\nshow us how much may be done in infected districts. At Ismailia malaria\r\nwas reduced from 1551 cases in 1902 to 37 cases in 1905. The cost of\r\noperations amounted to an initial expenditure of 6.25 francs, and an\r\nannual expenditure of about 2.3 francs per head of the population. \"The\r\nresults are due to mosquito reduction together with cinchonization.\" The\r\nfollowing is a tabulated list of the cases. The population of Ismailia\r\nis about 6000.\r\n\r\n  +------------------+------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n  | Year             | 1900 | 1901 | 1902* | 1903 | 1904 |  1905  |\r\n  +------------------+------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n  | Cases of Malaria | 2250 | 1990 | 1548  |  214 |   90 | 372[2] |\r\n  +------------------+------+------+-------+------+------+--------+\r\n\r\n  * Drainage works begun.\r\n\r\nKlang and Port Swettenham are contiguous towns in the Federated Malay\r\nStates, having a population of 4000 and a rainfall of 100 in. a year. At\r\nKlang the expenditure has been £3100, with an annual expenditure of\r\n£270, devoted to clearing and draining 332 acres. At Port Swettenham\r\n£7000, with an annual upkeep of £240, has been devoted to treating 110\r\nacres. In Hong-Kong similar measures were carried out, with the result\r\nthat the hospital admissions for malaria diminished from 1294 in 1901,\r\nthe year when operations were begun, to 419 in 1905.\r\n\r\n  Klang and Port Swettenham.\r\n\r\n  +------------------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  | Year             | 1900 | 1901* | 1902 | 1903 | 1904 | 1905 |\r\n  +------------------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  | Cases of Malaria |  510 |  610  |  199 |   69 |   32 |   23 |\r\n  +------------------+------+-------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\n  * Nearly all were relapses of previous infection.\r\n\r\nA systematic campaign for the destruction of breeding-places has been\r\ninaugurated in the British West African colonies, with encouraging\r\nresults. The planting of eucalyptus trees is out of favour at present,\r\nbut it appears to have been successful in Portugal, not from any\r\nprophylactic virtues in the plant, but through the great absorption of\r\nmoisture by its deep roots, which tends to dry the subsoil. Treating the\r\nbreeding-ponds with petroleum or similar preparations seems to be hardly\r\napplicable on a large scale, and in any case can only be a temporary\r\nexpedient. H. Ziemann advocates the destruction of mosquito larvae by\r\nthe growing of such plants as the water-pest (_Anacharis alsinatrum_)\r\nwhich covers the surface of the water and suffocates larvae and nymphae.\r\nShort of suppressing mosquitoes, the parasitic cycle may theoretically\r\nbe broken by preventing them from giving the infection to man or taking\r\nit from him. The means of accomplishing the former have been already\r\npointed out, but they are obviously difficult to carry out on a large\r\nscale, particularly in native communities. It is one thing to protect\r\nindividuals from mosquito bites, another to prevent the propagation of\r\nthe parasite in a whole community. Perhaps the converse is more feasible\r\nin some circumstances--that is to say, preventing mosquitoes from having\r\naccess to malarial persons, and so propagating the parasite in\r\nthemselves. It could be carried out where the infected persons are few,\r\nby isolating and protecting them, but not where many are infected, as in\r\nnative villages. Koch has suggested that the disinfection of malarial\r\npersons by quinine would have the desired effect, but other authorities\r\nof greater experience do not consider it practicable. In spite of the\r\ndifficulties, however, there is no doubt that a great deal can be done\r\nto reduce, if not stamp out, malaria by the methods indicated, which\r\nshould be applied according to circumstances. An encouraging example is\r\nafforded by the remarkable fact that malaria, which was once rife in\r\ncertain districts of England, has now died out, although the _Anopheles\r\nmaculipennis_ mosquito still exists there. The parasitic cycle has been\r\nbroken, and the insect is no longer infected. The suggested causes are\r\n(1) reduction of insects by drainage, (2) reduced population, (3) the\r\nuse of quinine. Sir Patrick Manson has suggested that the problem of\r\nstamping out malaria may be assisted by the discovery of some at present\r\nunknown factors. He has pointed out that certain areas and certain\r\nislands are entirely free from the disease, while neighbouring areas and\r\nislands are devastated. This immunity is apparently not due to the\r\nabsence of favourable conditions, but rather to the presence of some\r\ninimical factor which prevents the development of the parasite. If this\r\nfactor could be discovered it might be applied to the suppression of the\r\ndisease in malarious localities.\r\n\r\nA few other points may be noted. The pathological changes in malaria are\r\ndue to the deposition of melanin and the detritus of red corpuscles and\r\nhaemoglobin, and to the congregation of parasites in certain sites\r\n(Ross). In chronic cases the eventual effects are anaemia, melanosis,\r\nenlargement of the spleen and liver, and general cachexia. Apparently\r\nthe parasites may remain quiescent in the blood for years and may cause\r\nrelapses by fresh sporulation. Recent discoveries have done little or\r\nnothing for treatment. Quinine still remains the one specific. In\r\nserious cases it should not be given in solid form, but in solution by\r\nthe stomach, rectum, or--better--hypodermically (Manson). According to\r\nRoss, it should be given promptly, in sufficient doses (up to 30\r\ngrains), and should be continued for months. Euquinine is by some\r\npreferred to quinine, but it is more expensive. Nucleogen and Aristochin\r\nhave also been recommended instead of quinine. The nature of immunity is\r\nnot known. Some persons are naturally absolutely immune (Celli), but\r\nthis is rare; immunity is also sometimes acquired by infection, but as a\r\nrule persons once infected are more predisposed than others. Races\r\ninhabiting malarious districts acquire a certain degree of resistance,\r\nno doubt through natural selection. Children are much more susceptible\r\nthan adults.\r\n\r\n_Malaria in the Lower Vertebrates._--Birds are subject to malaria, which\r\nis caused by blood parasites akin to those in man and having a similar\r\nlife-history. Two species, affecting different kinds of birds, have been\r\nidentified. Their alternate hosts are mosquitoes of the _Culex_ genus.\r\nOxen, sheep, dogs, monkeys, bats, and probably horses also suffer from\r\nsimilar parasitic diseases. In the case of oxen the alternate host of\r\nthe parasite is a special tick (Smith and Kilborne). In the other\r\nanimals several parasites have been described by different observers,\r\nbut the alternate hosts are not known.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Celli, _Malaria_; Christy, _Mosquitoes and Malaria_;\r\n  Manson, _Tropical Diseases_; Allbutt's _System of Medicine_; Ross,\r\n  \"Malaria,\" Quain's _Dictionary of Medicine_, 3rd ed.; _The\r\n  Practitioner_, March, 1901 (Malaria Number); _Lancet_ (Sept. 29,\r\n  1907); _British Medical Journal_ (Oct. 19, 1907); _Indian Medical\r\n  Gazette_ (February 1908).     (A. Sl.; H. L. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALATIA (MALATIEH or ASPUZU) the chief town of a sanjak of the same name\r\nin the Mamuret el-Aziz vilayet of Asia Minor, and a military station on\r\nthe Samsun-Sivas-Diarbekr road, altitude 2900 ft., situated about 10 m.\r\nS.W. of the junction of the Tokhma Su (med. Kubakib) with the Euphrates,\r\nnear the south end of a fertile plain, and at the northern foot of the\r\nTaurus. Pop. about 30,000, including, besides many Armenian Christians,\r\nbodies of Kurds and \"Kizilbash.\" It is a wholly modern place, rebuilt\r\nsince the earthquake of 1893, contains fine public buildings, and is\r\nnoted for its fruit orchards. There are Protestant (American) and Roman\r\nCatholic missions, and an Armenian Catholic archbishop has his seat\r\nhere. Eskishehr or Old Malatia (_Melitene_), 5 m. N.E. and 3 m. from the\r\ngreat medieval bridge (Kirkgeuz) over the Tokhma Su, is said to owe its\r\npresent desolation largely to its occupation by Hafiz Pasha as his\r\nheadquarters in 1838 before his advance to fight the disastrous battle\r\nof Nizib with the Egyptian, Ibrahim. But it has still many inhabitants\r\nand large gardens and many ruinous mosques, baths, &c., relics of\r\nMansur's city. It was the residence of von Moltke for some months, while\r\nattached to Hafiz's army. The earliest site was possibly Arslan Tepe\r\nabout 2 m. south of Eskishehr were two \"Hittite\" stelae, representing\r\nhunting scenes, now in the Constantinople and Paris museums, were found\r\nin 1894.\r\n\r\n  In the time of Strabo (xii. 537) there was no town in the district of\r\n  Melitene, which was reckoned part of Cappadocia. Under Titus the place\r\n  became the permanent station of the 12th (\"Thundering\") legion; Trajan\r\n  raised it to a city. Lying in a very fertile country at the crossing\r\n  point of important routes, including the Persian \"Royal Road,\" and two\r\n  imperial military highways from Caesarea and along the Euphrates bank,\r\n  it grew in size and importance, and was the capital of Armenia Minor\r\n  or Secunda. Justinian, who completed the walls commenced by\r\n  Anastasius, made it the capital of Armenia Tertia; it was then a very\r\n  great place (Procop., _De aed._, iii. 4). The town was burnt by\r\n  Chosroes on his retreat after his great defeat there in 577. Taken by\r\n  the Saracens, retaken and destroyed by Constantine Copronymus, it was\r\n  presently recovered to Islam, and rebuilt under Mansur (A.D. 756). It\r\n  again changed hands more than once, being reckoned among the frontier\r\n  towns of Syria (Istakhry, pp. 55, 62). At length the Greeks recovered\r\n  it in 934, and Nicephorus II., finding the district much wasted,\r\n  encouraged the Jacobites to settle in it, which they did in great\r\n  numbers. A convent of the Virgin, and the great church which bears his\r\n  name, were erected by the bishop Ignatius (Isaac the Runner). From\r\n  this time Malatia continued to be a great seat of the Jacobites, and\r\n  it was the birthplace of their famous maphrian Barhebraeus (or\r\n  Abulfaragius). At the commencement of the 11th century the population\r\n  was said to number 60,000 fighting men (Assem., _Bib. Or._, ii. 149;\r\n  cf. Barheb., _Chr. Eccl._, i. 411, 423). At the time of the first\r\n  crusade, the city, being hard pressed by the Turks under Ibn\r\n  Danishmend, was relieved by Baldwin, after Bohemund had failed and\r\n  lost his liberty in the attempt. But the Jacobites had no cause to\r\n  love Byzantium, and the Greek governor Gabriel was so cruel and\r\n  faithless that the townsmen were soon glad to open their gates to Ibn\r\n  Danishmend (1102), and the city subsequently became part of the realm\r\n  of Kilij Arslan, sultan of Iconium.\r\n\r\n  See H.

It possesses a large literature, in which\r\nwords borrowed from Sanskrit are conspicuous. In 1901 the total number\r\nof speakers of Malayalam in all India was just about six millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAY ARCHIPELAGO[1] (variously called _Malaysia_, the _Indian\r\nArchipelago_, the _East Indies_, _Indonesia_, _Insulinde_), the largest\r\ngroup of islands in the world, lying south-east of Asia and north and\r\nnorth-west of Australia. It includes the Sunda Islands, the Moluccas,\r\nNew Guinea, and the Philippine Islands, but excludes the Andaman-Nicobar\r\ngroup. The equator passes through the middle of the archipelago; it\r\nsuccessively cuts Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes and Halmahera, four of the\r\nmost important islands. A. R. Wallace (who includes the Solomon Islands\r\nas well as New Guinea in the group) points out that the archipelago\r\n\"includes two islands larger than Great Britain; and in one of them,\r\nBorneo, the whole of the British Isles might be set down, and would be\r\nsurrounded by a sea of forests. Sumatra is about equal in extent to\r\nGreat Britain; Java, Luzon, and Celebes are each about the size of\r\nIreland. Eighteen more islands are on the average as large as Jamaica;\r\nand more than a hundred are as large as the Isle of Wight.\"\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+---------+-----------------------+\r\n  |                        |  Area.  | Estimated Population. |\r\n  +------------------------+---------+-----------------------+\r\n  | Sunda Islands          | 459,578 |      32,632,400       |\r\n  | Moluccas, with Celebes | 115,334 |       3,000,000       |\r\n  | New Guinea             | 312,329 |         800,000       |\r\n  | Philippine Islands     | 115,026 |       7,635,400       |\r\n  +------------------------+---------+-----------------------+\r\n\r\nThe islands of the archipelago nearly all present bold and picturesque\r\nprofiles against the horizon, and at the same time the character of the\r\nscenery varies from island to island and even from district to district.\r\nThe mountains are arranged for the most part in lines running either\r\nfrom north-west to south-east or from west to east. In Sumatra and in\r\nthe islands between Sumatra and Borneo the former direction is\r\ndistinctly marked, and the latter is equally noticeable in Java and the\r\nother southern islands. The mountains of Borneo, however, rise rather in\r\nshort ridges and clusters. Nothing in the general physiognomy of the\r\nislands is more remarkable than the number and distribution of the\r\nvolcanoes, active or extinct. Running south-east through Sumatra, east\r\nthrough Java and the southern islands to Timor, curving north through\r\nthe Moluccas, and again north, from the end of Celebes through the whole\r\nline of the Philippines, they follow a line roughly resembling a\r\nhorseshoe narrowed towards the point. The loftiest mountain in the\r\narchipelago would appear to be Kinabalu in Borneo (13,698 ft.). An\r\nimportant fact in the physical geography of the archipelago is that\r\nJava, Bali, Sumatra and Borneo, and the lesser islands between them and\r\nthe Asiatic mainland, all rest on a great submerged bank, nowhere more\r\nthan 100 fathoms below sea-level, which may be considered a continuation\r\nof the continent; while to the east the depth of the sea has been found\r\nat various places to be from 1000 to 2500 fathoms. As the value of this\r\nfact was particularly emphasized by Wallace, the limit of the shallow\r\nwater, which is found in the narrow but deep channel between Bali and\r\nLombok, and strikes north to the east of Borneo, has received the name\r\nof \"Wallace's Line.\" The Philippines on the other hand, \"are almost\r\nsurrounded by deep sea, but are connected with Borneo by means of two\r\nnarrow submarine banks\" (A. R. Wallace, _Island Life_). The archipelago,\r\nin effect, is divided between two great regions, the Asiatic and the\r\nAustralian, and the fact is evident in various branches of its\r\ngeography--zoological, botanical, and even human. It is believed that\r\nthere was a land-connexion between Asia and Australia in the later part\r\nof the Secondary epoch, and that the Australian continent, when\r\nseparated, became divided into islands before the south-eastern part of\r\nthe Asiatic did so.\r\n\r\n  The most notable fact in the geological history of the archipelago is\r\n  the discovery in Java of the fossil remains of _Pithecanthropus\r\n  erectus_, a form intermediate between the higher apes and man. In its\r\n  structure and cranial capacity it is entitled to a higher place in the\r\n  zoological scale than any anthropoid, for it almost certainly walked\r\n  erect; and, on the other hand, in its intellectual powers it must have\r\n  been much below the lowest of the human race at present known. The\r\n  strata in which it was found belong to the Miocene or Upper Pliocene.\r\n  Among the rocks of economic importance may be mentioned granite of\r\n  numerous kinds, syenite, serpentine, porphyry, marble, sandstones and\r\n  marls. Coal is worked in Sumatra, Borneo and Labuan. Diamonds are\r\n  obtained in Borneo, garnets in Sumatra, Bachian and Timor, and topazes\r\n  in Bachian, antimony in Borneo and the Philippines; lead in Sumatra,\r\n  Borneo and the Philippines; copper and malachite in the Philippines,\r\n  Timor, Borneo and Sumatra; and, most important of all, tin in Banka,\r\n  Billiton and Singkep. Iron is pretty frequent in various forms. Gold\r\n  is not uncommon in the older ranges of Sumatra, Banka, Celebes,\r\n  Bachian, Timor and Borneo. Manganese could be readily worked in Timor,\r\n  where it lies in the Carboniferous Limestone. Platinum is found in\r\n  Landak and other parts of Borneo. Petroleum is a valuable product of\r\n  Sumatra and Java, and is also found in Borneo.\r\n\r\n_Climate_, _Flora_, _Fauna._--The most striking general fact as regards\r\nclimate in the archipelago is that wherever that part of the south-east\r\nmonsoon which has passed over Australia strikes, the climate is\r\ncomparatively dry, and the vegetation is less luxuriant. The east end of\r\nJava, e.g. has a less rainfall than the west; the distribution of the\r\nrain on the north coast is quite different from that on the south, and a\r\nsimilar difference is observed between the east and the west of Celebes.\r\nThe north-west monsoon, beginning in October and lasting till March,\r\nbrings the principal rainy season in the archipelago.\r\n\r\n  Most of the islands of the archipelago belong to the great equatorial\r\n  forest-belt. In its economical aspect the vegetation, whether natural\r\n  or cultivated, is of prime interest. The list of fruits is very\r\n  extensive, though few of them are widely known. These, however,\r\n  include the orange, mango, mangosteen, shaddock, guava and the durian.\r\n  The variety of food-plants is equally notable. Not only are rice and\r\n  maize, sugar and coffee, among the widely cultivated crops, but the\r\n  coco-nut, the bread-fruit, the banana and plantain, the sugar-palm,\r\n  the tea-plant, the sago-palm, the coco-tree, the ground-nut, the yam,\r\n  the cassava, and others besides, are of practical importance. The\r\n  cultivation of sugar and coffee owes its development mainly to the\r\n  Dutch; and to them also is due the introduction of tea. They have\r\n  greatly encouraged the cultivation of the coco-nut among the natives,\r\n  and it flourishes, especially in the coast districts, in almost every\r\n  island in their territory. The oil is largely employed in native\r\n  cookery. Pepper, nutmegs and cloves were long the objects of the most\r\n  important branch of Dutch commerce; and gutta-percha, camphor, dammar,\r\n  benzoin and other forest products have a place among the exports.\r\n\r\n  To the naturalist the Malay Archipelago is a region of the highest\r\n  interest; and from an early period it has attracted the attention of\r\n  explorers of the first rank. The physical division between the Asiatic\r\n  and Australian regions is clearly reflected in the botany and zoology.\r\n  The flora of the Asiatic islands (thus distinguished) \"is a special\r\n  development of that prevailing from the Himalayas to the Malay\r\n  Peninsula and south China. Farther east this flora intermingles with\r\n  that of Australia\" (F. H. H. Guillemard, _Australasia_). Similarly, in\r\n  the Asiatic islands are found the great mammals of the continent--the\r\n  elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, anthropoid ape, &c., which are wanting\r\n  in the Australian region, with which the eastern part of the\r\n  archipelago is associated. (For details concerning flora and fauna,\r\n  see separate articles, especially JAVA.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Malay Archipelago.]\r\n\r\n_Inhabitants._--The majority of the native inhabitants of the Malay\r\nArchipelago belong to two races, the Malays and the Melanesians\r\n(Papuans). As regards the present racial distribution, the view accepted\r\nby many anthropologists, following A. H. Keane, is that the Negritos,\r\nstill found in the Philippines, are the true aborigines of Indo-China\r\nand western Malaysia, while the Melanesians, probably their kinsmen,\r\nwere the earliest occupants of eastern Malaysia and western Polynesia.\r\nAt some date long anterior to history it is supposed that Indo-China was\r\noccupied first by a fair Caucasian people and later by a yellow\r\nMongolian race. From these two have come all the peoples--other than\r\nNegrito or Papuan--found to-day from the Malay Peninsula to the farthest\r\nislands of Polynesia. The Malay Archipelago was thus first invaded by\r\nthe Caucasians, who eventually passed eastward and are to-day\r\nrepresented in the Malay Archipelago only by the Mentawi islanders. They\r\nwere followed by an immigration of Mongol-Caucasic peoples with a\r\npreponderance of Caucasic blood--the Indonesians of some, the pre-Malays\r\nof other writers--who are to-day represented in the archipelago by such\r\npeoples as the Dyaks of Borneo and the Battas of Sumatra. At a far later\r\ndate, probably almost within historic times, the true Malay race, a\r\ncombination of Mongol and Caucasic elements, came into existence and\r\noverran the archipelago, in time becoming the dominant race. A Hindu\r\nstrain is evident in Java and others of the western islands; Moors and\r\nArabs (that is, as the names are used in the archipelago, Mahommedans\r\nfrom various countries between Arabia and India) are found more or less\r\namalgamated with many of the Malay peoples; and the Chinese form, from\r\nan economical point of view, one of the most important sections of the\r\ncommunity in many of the more civilized districts. Chinese have been\r\nestablished in the archipelago from a very early date: the first Dutch\r\ninvaders found them settled at Jacatra; and many of them, as, for\r\ninstance, the colony of Ternate, have taken so kindly to their new home\r\nthat they have acquired Malay to the disuse of their native tongue.\r\nChinese tombs are among the objects that strike the traveller's\r\nattention at Amboyna and other ancient settlements.\r\n\r\n  There is a vast field for philological explorations in the\r\n  archipelago. Of the great number of distinct languages known to exist,\r\n  few have been studied scientifically. The most widely distributed is\r\n  the Malay, which has not only been diffused by the Malays themselves\r\n  throughout the coast regions of the various islands, but, owing partly\r\n  to the readiness with which it can be learned, has become the common\r\n  medium between the Europeans and the natives. The most cultivated of\r\n  the native tongues is the Javanese, and it is spoken by a greater\r\n  number of people than any of the others. To it Sundanese stands in the\r\n  relation that Low German holds to High German, and the Madurese in the\r\n  relation of a strongly individualized dialect. Among the other\r\n  languages which have been reduced to writing and grammatically\r\n  analysed are the Balinese, closely connected with the Javanese, the\r\n  Batta (with its dialect the Toba), the Dyak and the Macassarese.\r\n  Alfurese, a vague term meaning in the mouths of the natives little\r\n  else than non-Mahommedan, has been more particularly applied by Dutch\r\n  philologists to the native speech of certain tribes in Celebes. The\r\n  commercial activity of the Buginese causes their language to be fairly\r\n  widely spoken--little, however, by Europeans.\r\n\r\n_Political Division._--Politically the whole of the archipelago, except\r\nBritish North Borneo, &c. (see BORNEO), part of Timor (Portuguese), New\r\nGuinea east of the 141st meridian (British and German), and the\r\nPhilippine Islands, belongs to the Netherlands. The Philippine Islands\r\nwhich had been for several centuries a Spanish possession, passed in\r\n1898 by conquest to the United States of America. For these several\r\npolitical units see the separate articles; a general view, however, is\r\nhere given of the government, economic conditions, &c., of the Dutch\r\npossessions, which the Dutch call _Nederlandsch-Indië_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETHERLANDS INDIA\r\n\r\n  _Administration._--The Dutch possessions in Asia lie between 6° N. and\r\n  11° S. and 95° E. and 141° E. Politically they are divided into lands\r\n  under the direct government of the Netherlands vassal lands and\r\n  confederated lands. Administratively they are further divided into\r\n  residencies, divisions, regencies, districts, and _dessas_ or\r\n  villages. In the principal towns and villages there are parish\r\n  councils, and in some provinces county councils have been established.\r\n  Natives, Chinese and Arabs, are given seats, and in certain instances\r\n  some of the members are elected, but more generally they are appointed\r\n  by government. The islands are often described as of two groups, Java\r\n  and Madura forming one, and the other consisting of Sumatra, Borneo,\r\n  Riouw-Lingga Archipelago, Banka, Billiton, Celebes, Molucca\r\n  Archipelago, the small Sunda Islands, and a part of New Guinea--the\r\n  Outposts as they are collectively named. The Outposts are divided into\r\n  20 provinces. A governor-general holds the superior administrative and\r\n  executive authority, and is assisted by a council of five members,\r\n  partly of a legislative and partly of an advisory character, but with\r\n  no share in the executive work of the government. In 1907 a Bill was\r\n  introduced to add four extraordinary members to the council, but no\r\n  immediate action was taken. The governor-general not only has supreme\r\n  executive authority, but can of his own accord pass laws and\r\n  regulations, except in so far as these, from their nature, belong of\r\n  right to the home government, and as he is bound by the constitutional\r\n  principles on which, according to the _Regulations for the Government\r\n  of Netherlands India_, passed by the king and States-General in 1854,\r\n  the Dutch East Indies must be governed. There are nine departments,\r\n  each under a director: namely, justice; interior; instruction, public\r\n  worship and industry; agriculture (created in 1905); civil public\r\n  works; government works (created in 1908); finance; war; marine. The\r\n  administration of the larger territorial divisions (_gouvernement_,\r\n  _residentie_) is in the hands of Dutch governors, residents, assistant\r\n  residents and _contrôleurs_. In local government a wide use is made of\r\n  natives, in the appointment of whom a primary consideration is that if\r\n  possible the people should be under their own chieftains. In Surakarta\r\n  and Jokjakarta in Java, and in many parts of the Outposts, native\r\n  princes preserve their positions as vassals; they have limited power,\r\n  and act generally under the supervision of a Dutch official. In\r\n  concluding treaties with the vassal princes since 1905, the Dutch have\r\n  kept in view the necessity of compelling them properly to administer\r\n  the revenues of their states, which some of them formerly squandered\r\n  in their personal uses. Provincial banks have been established which\r\n  defray the cost of public works.\r\n\r\n  _Population._--The following table gives the area and population of\r\n  Java (including Madura) and of the Outposts:--\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------+--------+-------------------------+\r\n    |                              | Area:  |           Pop.          |\r\n    |                              |English +-----------+-------------+\r\n    |                              | sq. m. |   1900.   |    1905.    |\r\n    +------------------------------+--------+-----------+-------------+\r\n    | Java and Madura              | 50,970 |28,746,688 |  30,098,008 |\r\n    |         / Sumatra, West Coast| 31,649 | 1,527,297 |\\            |\r\n    |         | Sumatra, East Coast| 35,312 |   421,090 ||            |\r\n    |         | Benkulen           |  9,399 |   162,396 ||            |\r\n    | Sumatra<  Lampong Districts  | 11,284 |   142,426 | > 4,029,505 |\r\n    |         | Palembang          | 53,497 |   804,299 ||            |\r\n    |         \\ Achin              | 20,471 |   110,804 |/            |\r\n    | Riouw-Lingga Archipelago     | 16,301 |    86,186 |     112,216 |\r\n    | Banka                        |  4,446 |   106,305 |     115,189 |\r\n    | Billiton                     |  1,863 |    43,386 |      36,858 |\r\n    | Borneo, West Coast           | 55,825 |   413,067 |\\            |\r\n    | Borneo, South and East       |        |           | > 1,233,655 |\r\n    |   Districts                  |156,912 |   716,822 |/            |\r\n    | Celebes / Celebes            | 49,390 |   454,368 |     415,499 |\r\n    |         \\ Menado             | 22,080 |   429,773 |     436,406 |\r\n    | Molucca Islands              | 43,864 |   410,190 |     407,419 |\r\n    | Timor Archipelago            | 17,698 |   119,239 |     308,600 |\r\n    | Bali and Lombok              |  4,065 | 1,041,696 |     523,535 |\r\n    | New Guinea to 141° E.        |151,789 |   200,000 |       ....  |\r\n    +------------------------------+--------+-----------+-------------+\r\n    |          Total               |736,815 |36,000,000 |  37,717,377*|\r\n    +------------------------------+--------+-----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n    * Including 487 in Merauke, the capital of Dutch New Guinea.\r\n\r\n  In no case are the above figures for population more than fairly\r\n  accurate, and in some instances they are purely conjectural. The\r\n  population is legally divided into Europeans and persons assimilated\r\n  to them, and natives and persons assimilated to them. The first class\r\n  includes half-castes (who are numerous, for the Dutch are in closer\r\n  relationship with the natives than is the case with most colonizing\r\n  peoples), and also Armenians, Japanese, &c. The total number of this\r\n  class in 1900 was 75,833; 72,019 of these were called Dutch, but\r\n  61,022 of them were born in Netherlands India; there were also 1382\r\n  Germans, 441 British and 350 Belgians. Among the natives and persons\r\n  assimilated to them were about 537,000 Chinese and 27,000 Arabs. In\r\n  the decade 1890-1900 the increase of the European population was\r\n  30.9%, of the Arabs 26.6%, and of the Chinese 16.5%. A large\r\n  proportion of the Europeans are government officials, or retired\r\n  officials, for many of the Dutch, once established in the colonies,\r\n  settle there for life. The remaining Europeans are mostly planters and\r\n  heads of industrial establishments; the Arabs are nearly all traders,\r\n  as are some of the Chinese, but a large number of the latter are\r\n  labourers in the Sumatra tobacco plantations and the tin mines of\r\n  Banka, Billiton, &c. The bulk of the natives are agriculturists.\r\n\r\n  _Religion and Instruction._--Entire liberty is granted to the members\r\n  of all religious confessions. The Reformed Church has about 40\r\n  ministers and 30 assistants, the Roman Catholic 35 curates and 20\r\n  priests, not salaried out of the public funds. There are about 170\r\n  Christian missionaries, and the progress of their work may be\r\n  illustrated by showing that the number of Christians among the natives\r\n  and foreign Orientals was:--\r\n\r\n    +--------------------+---------+---------+---------------+\r\n    |                    | In 1873.| In 1896.|    In 1903.   |\r\n    +--------------------+---------+---------+---------------+\r\n    | In Java and Madura |   5,673 |  19,193 | About  34,000 |\r\n    | In the Outposts    | 148,672 | 290,065 |   \"   390,000 |\r\n    +--------------------+---------+---------+---------------+\r\n\r\n  About 10,000 natives go annually to Mecca on pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n  Both the government and private enterprise maintain vernacular\r\n  schools. Large sums have been voted in Holland for the establishment\r\n  of primary and secondary schools, and the government has undertaken to\r\n  assist in the establishment of parochial schools, the object being\r\n  that every village, at least in Java, should possess one. There are\r\n  schools for higher education at Batavia, Surabaya and Semarang; at the\r\n  first two of these towns are government schools for mechanical\r\n  engineering, and at Batavia a crafts school and a medical school for\r\n  natives. There are five colleges for native schoolmasters and four for\r\n  sons of native officials. Government schools for the European\r\n  education of Chinese children are established in the principal towns.\r\n  Private mechanical and crafts schools are established at Jokjakarta,\r\n  Surabaya and Semarang, and there is an agricultural school at\r\n  Buitenzorg.\r\n\r\n  _Justice._--As regards the administration of justice, the distinction\r\n  is maintained between (1) Europeans and persons assimilated with them\r\n  (who include Christians and Japanese), and (2) natives, together with\r\n  Chinese, Arabs, &c. The former are subject to laws closely resembling\r\n  those of the mother country, while the customs and institutions of\r\n  natives are respected in connexion with the administration of justice\r\n  to the latter. In 1906 a bill was passed somewhat modifying the\r\n  existing status of the classes above mentioned, and especially\r\n  directing new ordinances with regard to the judicial treatment of\r\n  Christian natives. A general judicial revision being also in\r\n  contemplation, this bill did not immediately come into force. Justice\r\n  for Europeans is administered by European judges, but, as with\r\n  administration at large so in judicial matters, native chiefs have\r\n  extensive powers in native affairs. For European justice the High\r\n  Court of Justice is established at Batavia; there are councils of\r\n  justice at Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya, with authority not only\r\n  over Java but over parts of the Outposts; there is a resident court of\r\n  justice in each residency. For native justice there are courts in the\r\n  districts and regencies; residents act as police judges; provincial\r\n  councils have judicial powers, and there are councils of priests with\r\n  powers in matrimonial disputes, questions of succession, &c.\r\n\r\n  As regards pauperism, the government subsidizes Protestant and\r\n  Catholic orphan houses.\r\n\r\n  _Finance._--The revenue of Netherlands India has been derived mainly\r\n  from customs, excise, ground-tax, licences, poll-tax, &c., from\r\n  monopolies--opium, salt and pawn-shops (the management of which began\r\n  to be taken over by the government in 1903, in place of the previous\r\n  system of farming-out), coffee, &c., railways, tin mines and forests,\r\n  and from agricultural and other concessions. But attempts have been\r\n  made, and have been largely successful, to make the revenue dependent\r\n  to a less extent on monopolies and the products (especially\r\n  agricultural) of the land; and to abolish licences and substitute\r\n  direct taxes. There is a progressive income-tax for Europeans, and the\r\n  system has also been applied in the case of natives.\r\n\r\n  The following table affords comparisons in the revenue and\r\n  expenditure:--\r\n\r\n    +------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    | Year.|   Revenue.  | Expenditure. |\r\n    +------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    | 1880 | £12,236,500 | £12,244,666  |\r\n    | 1890 |  11,482,457 |  10,644,728  |\r\n    | 1900 |  11,832,417 |  12,313,854  |\r\n    | 1905 |  12,951,497 |  13,844,173  |\r\n    +------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  The monetary system is similar to that of Holland (the unit being the\r\n  _guilder_), but there are also certain silver and copper coins of\r\n  small value bearing Malay or Javanese inscriptions. The Java Bank,\r\n  established in 1828, with headquarters at Batavia, is the only bank\r\n  issuing notes, two-fifths of the amount of which must be covered by\r\n  specie or bullion. The government has a control over the\r\n  administration of this bank.\r\n\r\n  _Defence._--The army is purely colonial, i.e. distinct from that of\r\n  the Netherlands. Its strength is a little under 40,000, about\r\n  one-third being Europeans of various nationalities and two-thirds\r\n  natives of various races. No portion of the regular army of the\r\n  Netherlands is allowed to be sent on colonial service, but individual\r\n  soldiers are at liberty to enlist, by permission of their commanding\r\n  officers, in the army of Netherlands India, and they form its nucleus.\r\n  Native and European soldiers are generally mixed together in the same\r\n  battalions, though in separate companies. The officers were all Dutch\r\n  till 1908, when a trial was made of native officers from noble\r\n  Javanese families. The artillery is composed of European gunners, with\r\n  native riders, while the cavalry are Europeans and natives. A military\r\n  academy is established at Meester Cornelis, near Batavia. Schools for\r\n  soldiers are attached to every battalion. There are certain local\r\n  forces outside the regular army--militia in some of the large towns,\r\n  native infantry in Madura, and guards of some of the vassal princes.\r\n  Unlike the army, which is purely colonial, the navy in Netherlands\r\n  India is partly colonial, partly belonging to the royal navy of the\r\n  Netherlands, and its expenses are therefore borne partly by the mother\r\n  country and partly by the colony. About six ironclads and twenty\r\n  smaller vessels of the royal navy are stationed in colonial waters;\r\n  the vessels of the colonial marine number about twenty-four, and\r\n  undertake police supervision, prevention of slave trading, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Trade and Industries._--The principal articles of export are sugar,\r\n  tobacco, copra, forest products (various gums, &c.), coffee,\r\n  petroleum, tea, cinchona, tin, rice, pepper, spices and gambier. The\r\n  average annual value of exports during 1900-1905 was £22,496,468, and\r\n  of imports £17,050,338. A great proportion of the exports goes to the\r\n  mother country, though a considerable quantity of rice is exported to\r\n  China. An indication of the mineral products has already been given;\r\n  as regards the export trade, tin is the most important of these, but\r\n  the Ombilin coalfields of Sumatra, connected by a railway with the\r\n  coast, call for mention here also. Agricultural labour is very\r\n  carefully regulated by law, in the enforcement of which the residents\r\n  and lower officials have wide powers. One day's gratuitous labour out\r\n  of seven or more can be demanded of labourers either on private or on\r\n  government estates; but in 1882 this form of labour was for the most\r\n  part abolished as far as government estates were concerned, each\r\n  labourer so exempted paying one guilder per year. The principal\r\n  private agricultural estates are in the west of Java, in which island\r\n  the greater part of the soil is government property. Such estates have\r\n  increased greatly in number and extent, not only in Java but\r\n  elsewhere, since the agrarian law of 1870, under which it became\r\n  possible for settlers to obtain waste lands on hereditary lease for 75\r\n  years. In 1899 the total acreage of land ceded was 1,002,766 acres; in\r\n  1903 it was 1,077,295. The government ceased to cultivate sugar in\r\n  1891, but coffee, and to some extent cinchona, are cultivated on\r\n  government plantations, though not in equal quantity to that grown on\r\n  land held on emphyteusis. The average annual yield of sugar in\r\n  1900-1905 was 852,400 tons, but it increased steadily during that\r\n  period. The average annual yield of coffee during the same period was\r\n  101,971,132 lb.; it fluctuates greatly. The average annual production\r\n  of tobacco is about fifty million pounds from each of the islands of\r\n  Java and Sumatra. The total annual yield of the tin mines is about\r\n  15,000 tons, and of the coal mines 240,000 tons. The average output of\r\n  petroleum annually in 1900-1905 was 120,000,000 gallons; this, again,\r\n  has fluctuated greatly. There are upwards of 3000 miles of railways\r\n  and steam tramways in Netherlands India, but these are almost entirely\r\n  in Java; elsewhere only Sumatra has a few short lines. The principal\r\n  steamship company in the archipelago is the Royal Packet (_Koninklyke\r\n  Paketvaart_) Company.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--See _Aardrijkskundig en statistisch Woordenboek van\r\n  Nederl.

Malay and Chinese records also furnish material for the\r\nearly history of individual islands, but the known history of the\r\narchipelago as a whole begins in the 16th century. At this period a\r\ncivilization, largely of Hindu origin, had flourished and decayed in\r\nJava, where, as in all the more important islands, Mahommedanism had\r\nafterwards become the dominant creed. But the smaller islands and the\r\nremoter districts, even of Java and Sumatra, remained in a condition of\r\ncomplete savagery.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese were the first Europeans to colonize any part of the\r\narchipelago. A Portuguese squadron under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira arrived\r\noff Sumatra in 1509, explored the north coast for some distance, and\r\nnoted that the inhabitants of the interior were cannibals, while those\r\nof the littoral were civilized and possessed a gold coinage. The main\r\nobject of the Portuguese was to obtain a share in the lucrative spice\r\ntrade carried on by the Malays, Chinese and Japanese; the trade-routes\r\nof the archipelago converged upon Malacca, which was the point of\r\ndeparture for spice merchants trading with every country on the shores\r\nof the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. In 1511 the Portuguese under\r\nAlphonso d'Albuquerque occupied Malacca, and in November of that year an\r\nexpedition under Antonio de Abreu was despatched to find a route to the\r\nMoluccas and Banda Islands, then famous for their cloves and nutmegs.\r\nThe explorers reached Amboyna and Ternate, after gaining some knowledge\r\nof Java, Madura, Sumbawa and other islands, possibly including New\r\nGuinea. During the return voyage the second-in-command, Francisco\r\nSerrão, was shipwrecked, but succeeded in making his way in a native\r\nboat to Mindanao. Thus the Philippines were discovered: In 1514 a second\r\nPortuguese fleet arrived at Ternate, which during the next five years\r\nbecame the centre of Portuguese enterprise in the archipelago; regular\r\ntraffic with Malacca and Cochin was established, and the native raja\r\nbecame a vassal of Portugal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Spanish government was considering whether the Moluccas\r\ndid not fall within the Spanish sphere of influence as defined by the\r\nTreaty of Tordesillas in 1494; and in August 1519 an expedition\r\ncommanded by Ferdinand Magellan (q.v.) sailed from Seville to seek a\r\nwestward passage to the archipelago. After losing the commander in the\r\nPhilippines and discovering Borneo, the two surviving ships reached the\r\nMoluccas late in 1520. One vessel returned to Seville by the Cape route,\r\nthus completing the first voyage round the world; the other attempted to\r\nreturn by the Pacific, but was driven back to Tidore and there welcomed\r\nby the natives as a useful ally against the Portuguese. Reinforcements\r\nfrom Spain arrived in 1525 and 1528; but in 1529 a treaty was concluded\r\nbetween the emperor Charles V. and John III. of Portugal, by which, in\r\nreturn for 350,000 gold ducats, the Spanish claim to the Moluccas was\r\nwithdrawn. The boundary between the Spanish and Portuguese spheres was\r\nfixed at 17° E. of the Moluccas, but by a geographical fiction the\r\nPhilippines were included within the Spanish sphere. Further disputes\r\noccurred from time to time, and in 1542 a Spanish fleet came into\r\nconflict with the Portuguese off Amboyna; but after 1529 the supremacy\r\nof each power in its own sphere was never seriously endangered.\r\n\r\nThough the Portuguese traders frequented the coast of Java, they annexed\r\nno territory either there or in Sumatra; but farther east they founded\r\nnumerous forts and factories, notably in Amboyna, the Banda Island,\r\nCelebes and Halmahera. Ternate remained the seat of the governor of the\r\nMoluccas, who was the highest official in the archipelago, though\r\nsubordinate to the viceroy or governor of Portuguese India. The first\r\nattempt to enter into relations with the states of Borneo was made by D.\r\nJorge de Menezes, who visited Brunci in 1526, and in 1528 sent an envoy\r\nto its raja. The embassy failed in a curious manner. Among the gifts\r\nsent by Menezes was a piece of tapestry representing the marriage of\r\nCatherine of Aragon to Arthur, prince of Wales. The raja was persuaded\r\nthat these mysterious figures were demons under a spell, which might\r\ncome to life and kill him as he slept. The envoy was therefore\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nIn 1536, after a period of war and anarchy caused by the tyrannical rule\r\nof Menezes, Antonio Galvão, the historian, was appointed governor of the\r\nMoluccas. He crushed the rebellion and won the affection of the natives\r\nby his just and enlightened administration, which had no parallel in the\r\nannals of Portuguese rule in the archipelago. He returned to Europe in\r\n1540 (see PORTUGAL: _Literature_), after inaugurating an active\r\nmissionary movement, which was revived in 1546-1547 by Francis Xavier\r\n(q.v.). At this period the Portuguese power in the East was already\r\nbeginning to wane; in the archipelago it was weakened by administrative\r\ncorruption and by incessant war with native states, notably Bintang and\r\nAchin; bitter hostility was aroused by the attempts which the Portuguese\r\nmade to establish a commercial monopoly and to force Christianity upon\r\ntheir native subjects and allies (see PORTUGAL: _History_). From 1580 to\r\n1640 Portugal was itself united to Spain--a union which differed from\r\nannexation in little but name.\r\n\r\n_The English and Dutch, 1595-1674._--Pirates from Dieppe visited the\r\narchipelago between 1527 and 1539. It is possible that they reached\r\nAustralia[2]--more than sixty years before the first voyage thither of\r\nwhich there is any clear record; but their cruise had no political\r\nsignificance, and the Spaniards and Portuguese remained without European\r\ncompetitors until the appearance of Sir Francis Drake in 1579. An\r\nEnglish squadron under Sir James Lancaster came into conflict with the\r\nPortuguese in 1591, and an expedition under Sir Henry Middleton traded\r\nin the archipelago in 1604. But the English were simple traders or\r\nexplorers; far more formidable were the Dutch, who came to the East\r\npartly to avenge the injuries inflicted on their country by the\r\nSpaniards, partly to break the commercial monopoly of the peninsular\r\nstates. As middlemen they already possessed a large interest in the\r\nspice trade, for the Portuguese, having no direct access to the\r\nprincipal European markets, had made a practice of sending cargo to the\r\nNetherlands for distribution by way of the Scheldt and Rhine. The Dutch\r\nnow sought to monopolize not only the distribution but the production of\r\nspices--an enterprise facilitated by the co-operation of many exiled\r\nPortuguese Jews who had settled in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe first Dutch fleet sailed from Texel, under the command of Cornelis\r\nHoutman, on the 2nd of April 1595 and reached Sumatra on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1596. It visited Madura, and came into conflict with the\r\nPortuguese at Bantam in Java, returning to Holland in 1597. Though not a\r\ncommercial success, the expedition had demonstrated the weakness of the\r\nPortuguese. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (q.v.) was\r\nincorporated, and for nearly two centuries this organization played the\r\nchief part in the history of the archipelago. By 1604 the Dutch could\r\nalready claim to be the stronger power at sea. They had attacked the\r\nPortuguese in Ceylon (1601), established friendly relations with Achin\r\n(1602), and defeated a powerful fleet off Banda (1602). In 1606 they\r\nconcluded a treaty of alliance with the sultan of Johor, and in 1608\r\nthey forced the Portuguese to assent to an armistice for twelve years.\r\nOn the 29th of November 1609 Pieter Both was chosen by the\r\nstates-general, on the nomination of the Dutch East India Company, as\r\nfirst governor-general of Netherlands India. In 1611 the headquarters of\r\nthe Dutch was changed from Bantam to Jakarta, which in 1619 was renamed\r\nBatavia, and was thenceforward the Dutch capital. Meanwhile the English\r\nEast India Company, chartered in 1600, had also extended its operations\r\nto the archipelago. After 1611 the commercial rivalry between the Dutch\r\nand British became acute, and in 1613, 1615 and 1618 commissioners met\r\nin London to discuss the matters in dispute. The result of their\r\ndeliberations was the Treaty of Defence, signed on the 2nd of June 1619\r\nand modified on the 24th of January 1620, which arranged for\r\nco-operation between the Dutch and British companies, and especially for\r\nthe maintenance of a joint fleet. But neither company could restrain\r\nits agents in the East from aggressive action, and many fresh causes of\r\ndispute arose, the chief being the failure of the British to provide the\r\nnaval forces required for service against the Portuguese, and the\r\nso-called \"massacre of Amboyna\" (q.v.) in 1623. The Treaty of Defence\r\nlapsed in 1637, but as early as 1634 the British made peace with\r\nPortugal. Even without allies, however, the Dutch continued to extend\r\ntheir trade and to annex fresh territory, for the British were weakened\r\nby civil war at home, while, after 1640, the Portuguese were struggling\r\nto maintain their independence against Spain. The Dutch company opened\r\nup a profitable trade with Japan and China, and prosecuted the war\r\nagainst Portugal with great vigour, invading Portuguese India and\r\ncapturing Point de Galle in 1640, Malacca in 1641, Cochin and Cannanore\r\nin 1663. The war with England in 1652-54 and the renewal of the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese alliance by the marriage of Charles II. to Catherine of\r\nBraganza in 1661 were unable to check the growth of Dutch power; more\r\nserious was the resistance offered by some of the native states.\r\nRebellions in Java (1629) and the Moluccas (1650) were suppressed with\r\ngreat severity, but in 1662 the company suffered a heavy reverse in\r\nFormosa, all its colonists being expelled from the island. A new war\r\nbetween Great Britain and Holland broke out in 1672 and was terminated\r\nby the Treaty of Westminster (February 17, 1674), by which the points at\r\nissue between the two companies were referred first to commissioners and\r\nfinally to an arbitrator. The full details of the settlement are\r\nunknown, but thenceforward the British company devoted its energies\r\nchiefly to the development of its Indian possessions, while the Dutch\r\nwere left supreme in the archipelago. In 1684 the British even evacuated\r\nBantam, their chief settlement, and retired to Benkulen in Sumatra,\r\nwhich remained for more than a century their sole territorial possession\r\nin the archipelago.\r\n\r\n_Dutch Ascendancy, 1674-1749._--The weakness of Spain and Portugal and\r\nthe withdrawal of the British left the Dutch company free to develop its\r\nvast colonial and commercial interests. In 1627 the so-called Dutch\r\n\"colonial system\" had been inaugurated by the fourth governor-general,\r\nJan Pieterszoon Coen (q.v.). Under this system, which was intended to\r\nprovide Netherlands India with a fixed population of European descent,\r\nDutch girls were sent to the archipelago to be married to white\r\nsettlers, and subsequently marriages between Dutchmen and captive native\r\nwomen were encouraged. As early as 1624 vast fortunes had been acquired\r\nby trade: two members of the company who died in that year were stated\r\nto possess seven and eight tons of gold respectively, an amount\r\napproximately equivalent, in the aggregate, to £2,000,000. The use of\r\nslave labour, and the application of the _corvée_ system to natives who\r\nwere nominally free, enabled the company to lower the cost of\r\nproduction, while the absence of competition enabled it to raise prices.\r\nThe hardship inflicted on the native races provoked an insurrection\r\nthroughout Java, in which the Chinese settlers participated; but the\r\nDutch maintained naval and military forces strong enough to crush all\r\nresistance, and a treaty between the company and the Susuhunan in\r\nNovember 1749 made them practically supreme throughout the island.\r\n\r\n_Decline of Dutch Power, 1749-1811._--In the second half of the 17th\r\ncentury the monopoly system and the employment of slaves and forced\r\nlabour gave rise to many abuses, and there was a rapid decline in the\r\nrevenue from sugar, coffee and opium, while the competition of the\r\nBritish East India Company, which now exported spices, indigo, &c. from\r\nIndia to Europe, was severely felt. The administration was corrupt,\r\nlargely because of the vast powers given to officials, who were\r\ninvariably underpaid; and the financial methods of the company\r\nprecipitated its ruin, large dividends being paid out of borrowed money.\r\nThe burden of defence could no longer be sustained; piracy and smuggling\r\nbecame so common that the company was compelled to appeal to the\r\nstates-general for aid. In 1798 it was abolished and its authority\r\nvested in a \"Council of the Asiatic Possessions.\" In 1803 a commission\r\nmet to consider the state of the Dutch colonies, and advocated drastic\r\nadministrative and commercial reforms, notably freedom of trade in all\r\ncommodities except firearms, opium, rice and wood--with coffee, pepper\r\nand spices, which were state monopolies. Some of these reforms were\r\ncarried out by H. W. Daendels (1808-1811), who was sent out as\r\ngovernor-general by Louis Bonaparte, after the French conquest of\r\nHolland. Daendels, however, maintained the existing restrictions upon\r\ntrade and even made rice a state monopoly. His harsh rule aroused great\r\nantagonism; in 1811 he was recalled and J. W. Janssens became\r\ngovernor-general.\r\n\r\n_British Occupation, 1811-1816._--Netherlands India was at this time\r\nregarded as a part of the Napoleonic Empire, with which Great Britain\r\nwas at war. A British naval squadron arrived in the Moluccas in February\r\n1810 and captured Amboyna, Banda, Ternate and other islands. In 1811 a\r\nstrong fleet was equipped by Lord Minto, then governor-general of India,\r\nfor the conquest of Java; a British force was landed on the 4th of\r\nAugust; Batavia was captured on the 26th, and on the 18th of September\r\nJanssens and the remnant of his army surrendered. Lord Minto had issued\r\na proclamation establishing British rule on the 11th of September, and\r\nThomas (afterwards Sir Thomas) Stamford Raffles was appointed\r\nlieutenant-governor. Raffles (q.v.) held office until March 1816, and\r\nintroduced many important changes in the departments of revenue,\r\ncommerce and judicature. He was succeeded by John Fendall, who in 1816\r\ncarried out the retrocession of Netherlands India to the Dutch, in\r\naccordance with the Treaty of Vienna (1814).\r\n\r\n_Restoration and Reform of Dutch Power, 1816-1910._--Various disputes\r\nbetween Great Britain and the Netherlands, arising chiefly out of the\r\ntransfer of power in Java and the British occupation of Singapore\r\n(1819), were settled by treaty between the two powers in 1824. By this\r\ntreaty the Dutch were given almost entire freedom of action in Sumatra,\r\nwhile the Malay Peninsula was recognized as within the British sphere of\r\ninfluence. In 1825-30 a serious rebellion in Java involved the despatch\r\nof a large military force from the Netherlands, and was with difficulty\r\nsuppressed. An outbreak of Mahommedan fanaticism in Sumatra also gave\r\nmuch trouble.\r\n\r\nThe reform movement inaugurated by the commission of 1803 was resumed in\r\n1830, when Governor-General Johannes van den Bosch endeavoured to\r\nimprove the conditions of land-tenure and agriculture by introducing the\r\nso-called \"culture system.\" The native cultivators were to be exempted\r\nfrom the ground-tax, but were to cultivate one-fifth of their land as\r\nthe government might direct, the government taking the produce. This\r\nculture-system worked fairly during Van den Bosch's tenure of office,\r\nbut gave rise to many abuses between 1833 and 1844, involving, as it\r\ndid, a combination of the _métayer_ and _corvée_ systems.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the _Grondwet_, or fundamental law of the Netherlands,\r\nrecognized for the first time the responsibility of the Dutch nation for\r\nits colonial dependencies. The _Grondwet_ involved certain important\r\nchanges, which were embodied in an act passed in 1854 and commonly known\r\nas the _Regulations for the Government of Netherlands India_. The\r\n_Regulations_ substituted statute law for administrative and military\r\ndespotism, and made the governor-general in council responsible to the\r\nminister of the colonies at the Hague. They reformed the judicature,\r\nintroduced elementary education for the natives, and abolished slavery\r\nin Java as from the 1st of January 1860. They also prepared the way for\r\nfurther legislation tending towards the gradual emancipation of the\r\nnatives from the culture system, and from semi-feudal servitude to their\r\nnative rulers. That servitude existed in many forms all over the\r\narchipelago, but among the most curious must be reckoned the\r\n_pandelingschap_ or \"pledgedom,\" which originated in Borneo, and\r\naccording to which a man had the power to make his debtors his serfs\r\nuntil their debts were paid.\r\n\r\nThe reform movement was aided by the publication in 1860 of _Max\r\nHavelaar_, a romance by E. Douwes Dekker (q.v.), which contained a\r\nscathing indictment of the colonial system. Many important financial and\r\nagrarian measures were carried between 1860 and 1890. In 1863 Fransen\r\nvan de Putte, minister for the colonies, introduced the first of the\r\nannual colonial budgets for which the _Regulations_ had provided, thus\r\nenabling the states-general to control the revenue and expenditure of\r\nNetherlands India; in 1865 he reduced and in 1872 abolished the\r\ndifferentiation of customs dues in favour of goods imported from\r\nHolland, substituting a uniform import duty of 6% and establishing a\r\nnumber of free ports throughout the archipelago. The import duty was\r\nconsidered so moderate that an increase required for revenue purposes\r\nwas readily conceded in 1886. In 1876 the practice of paying a yearly\r\nsurplus (_batig slot_) from the revenues of Netherlands India to the\r\ntreasury at the Hague was discontinued. The chief reforms in the land\r\nsystem were those introduced by De Waal, then minister for the colonies,\r\nin 1870. The cultivation of pepper, cochineal, cinnamon and indigo for\r\nthe government had already ceased; De Waal restricted the area of the\r\nsugar plantations (carried on by forced native labour) as from 1878, and\r\nprovided for their abolition after 1890. He also enabled natives to\r\nsecure proprietary rights over the land they cultivated, and legalized\r\nthe leasing of Crown forest-lands to Europeans.\r\n\r\nThe extension of Dutch political power--notably in Java, Sumatra,\r\nCelebes, the Moluccas, Borneo, the Sunda Islands and New\r\nGuinea--proceeded simultaneously with the reform movement, and from time\r\nto time involved war with various native states. A large expedition was\r\nsent to Lombok in 1894, and almost the whole of that island was\r\nincorporated in the Dutch dominions. The long and costly war with Achin\r\n(q.v.) began in 1873 and reached its climax in the military occupation\r\nof the country after 1905, when the native sultan surrendered and was\r\ndeported. A guerrilla war was still carried on by his subjects, but\r\ntheir principal leader, the chief Panglima Polim, was captured in 1907;\r\nin 1908-1910 the condition of Achin under the military rule of General\r\nSwart was one of almost unbroken peace, and taxes were regularly paid.\r\n\r\nWhile the Dutch were thus consolidating their authority, other countries\r\nwere acquiring new commercial or colonial interests in the archipelago.\r\nImmigration from China and Japan steadily increased, especially towards\r\nthe end of the period 1816-1910. The enterprise of Sir James Brooke\r\n(q.v.) led, after 1838, to the establishment of British sovereignty in\r\nNorth Borneo; in 1895 New Guinea was divided between Great Britain,\r\nGermany and the Netherlands; and the Spanish-American War of 1898\r\nresulted in the cession of the Philippines, Sulu Island and the largest\r\nof the Mariana Islands to the United States, and the sale of the\r\nCaroline group to Germany. Australian and Japanese trade in the\r\narchipelago was stimulated by the establishment of the Australian\r\nCommonwealth (1901) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). In 1910 the\r\nnations most directly interested in the future of the archipelago were\r\nthe Netherlands, Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, China\r\nand Portugal.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--For the period 1511-1595, the chief Portuguese\r\n  authorities are the chronicles of Barros, Corrêa, Castanheda and Couto\r\n  (see PORTUGAL: _History_), with the letters of Xavier (q.v.), and the\r\n  _Tratado_ of A.

(London, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAIR, a small province of Persia, situated between Hamadan and\r\nBurujird. It has a population of about 70,000, and, together with the\r\ndistrict Tusirkhan, pays a yearly revenue of about £13,000. It produces\r\nmuch corn and fruit; a great quantity of the latter, dried, is exported.\r\nIts capital and seat of government is Doletabad (Dowletabad), a thriving\r\nlittle city, with a population of about 5000, situated at an elevation\r\nof 5680 ft., 38 m. from Hamadan and 32 m. from Burujird. It has post and\r\ntelegraph offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAY PENINSULA (called by the Malays _Tanah Malayu_, i.e. the Malay\r\nLand), a lozenge-shaped strip of land projecting into the China Sea,\r\nand forming the most southerly portion of the continent of Asia.\r\nGeographically, the peninsula begins at the isthmus of Kra, 10° N., at\r\nwhich point it is only between 60 and 70 m. in width, and the distance\r\nfrom sea to sea is further diminished by a large irregular salt-water\r\ninlet. Politically and anthropologically, however, this upper portion\r\nmust be regarded as a continuation of the kingdom of Siam rather than as\r\na section of Malaya. From the isthmus of Kra the peninsula extends south\r\nwith a general inclination towards the east, the most southerly point\r\nbeing Tanjong Bulus in 1° 16½´ N. A line drawn diagonally down the\r\ncentre from the isthmus of Kra to Cape Romania (Ramunya) gives the\r\nextreme length at about 750 miles. The breadth at the widest point, from\r\nTanjong Pen-unjut in Trengganu to Tanjong Hantu in the Dindings\r\nterritory, is about 200 m. The area is estimated at about 70,000 sq. m.\r\nThe peninsula is bounded on the N. by Siam, on the S. by the island and\r\nstrait of Singapore, on the E. by the China Sea, and on the W. by the\r\nStrait of Malacca.\r\n\r\n  _Physical Characteristics._--A range of granite mountains forms a\r\n  backbone which divides the peninsula into two unequal portions, the\r\n  larger of which lies to the east and the smaller to the west of the\r\n  chain. Smaller ranges run parallel to the main mountain chain in many\r\n  places, and there are numerous isolated spurs which have no connexion\r\n  with either. The country is covered with limestone in many parts, and\r\n  large isolated bluffs of this formation stand up in the plains both on\r\n  the eastern and the western slopes. The descent from the summits of\r\n  the range into the plain is somewhat less abrupt on the western than\r\n  it is on the eastern side, and between the foot of the mountains and\r\n  the Strait of Malacca the largest known alluvial deposits of tin are\r\n  situated. On the eastern side of the range, after a steep descent, the\r\n  granite formation speedily gives place to slates of vast depth,\r\n  intersected here and thereby fissures of quartz containing gold, and\r\n  in many places covered by limestone which has been superimposed upon\r\n  the slates. The highest known peak in the main range is that of Gunong\r\n  Korbu, 7217 ft. above sea-level. The highest mountain is believed to\r\n  be Gunong Tahan, which forms part of an isolated range on the eastern\r\n  side, between Pahang and Kelantan, and is estimated at about 8000 ft.\r\n  The west coast throughout its whole length is covered to a depth of\r\n  some miles with mangrove swamps, with only a few isolated stretches of\r\n  sandy beach, the dim foliage of the mangroves and the hideous mud\r\n  flats presenting a depressing spectacle. On the east coast the force\r\n  of the north-east monsoon, which beats upon the shores of the China\r\n  Sea annually from November to February, has kept the land for the most\r\n  part free from mangroves, and the sands, broken here and there by\r\n  rocky headlands thickly wooded, and fringed by _casuarina_ trees,\r\n  stretch for miles without interruption. The islands on each coast\r\n  present the features of the shore to which they are adjacent. On both\r\n  the east and the west coast the islands are thickly wooded, but\r\n  whereas the former are surrounded by beautiful sands and beaches, the\r\n  latter are fringed by mangrove-swamps. The whole peninsula may be\r\n  described as one vast forest, intersected in every direction by\r\n  countless streams and rivers which together form the most lavish\r\n  water-system in the world. Only an insignificant fraction of these\r\n  forests has ever been visited by human beings, the Malays and even the\r\n  aboriginal tribe having their homes on the banks of the rivers, and\r\n  never, even when travelling from one part of the country to another,\r\n  leaving the banks of a stream except for a short time when passing\r\n  from one river-system to another. The bulk of the jungle, therefore,\r\n  which lies between stream and stream, has never been trodden by the\r\n  foot of man. The principal rivers on the west coast are the Perak, the\r\n  Bernam and the Muar. The first-named is far finer than its fellows,\r\n  and is navigable for steamers for about 40 m. from its mouth, and for\r\n  native craft for over 250 m. It is exceedingly shallow, however, and\r\n  is not of much importance as a waterway. The Bernam runs through flat\r\n  swampy country for the greater part of its course, and steam-launches\r\n  can penetrate to a distance of over 100 m. from its mouth, and it is\r\n  therefore probably the deepest river. The country which it waters,\r\n  however, is not of any value, and it is not much used. The Muar waters\r\n  a very fertile valley, and is navigable for native boats for over 150\r\n  m. On the east coast the principal streams are the Petani, Telubin,\r\n  Kelantan, Besut, Trengganu, Dungun, Kmamun, Kuantan, Pahang, Rompin,\r\n  Endau and Sedeli, all guarded by difficult bars at their mouths, and\r\n  dangerous during the continuance of the north-east monsoon. The\r\n  deepest rivers are the Kuantan and Rompin; the largest are the\r\n  Kelantan and the Pahang, both of which are navigable for native boats\r\n  for a distance of over 250 m. The Trengganu river is obstructed by\r\n  impassable rapids at a distance of about 30 m. from its mouth. The\r\n  rivers on the east coast are practically the only highways, the Malays\r\n  always travelling by boat in preference to walking, but they serve\r\n  their purpose very indifferently, and their great beauty is their\r\n  chief claim to distinction. Magnificent caves are found on both slopes\r\n  of the peninsula, those at Batu in Selangor being the finest on the\r\n  west coast, while those of Chadu and Koto Glanggi in Pahang are the\r\n  most extensive yet visited by Europeans on the east coast. They are\r\n  all of limestone formation. So far as is known, the Malay Peninsula\r\n  consists of an axial zone of crystalline rocks, flanked on each side\r\n  by an incomplete band of sedimentary deposits. Granite is the most\r\n  widely spread of the crystalline rocks; but dikes of various kinds\r\n  occur, and gneiss, schist and marble are also met with. These rocks\r\n  form the greater part of the central range, and they are\r\n  often--especially the granite--decomposed and rotten to a considerable\r\n  depth. The sedimentary deposits include slate, limestone and\r\n  sandstone. Impure coal has also been recorded. The limestone has\r\n  yielded _Proetus_, _Chonetes_ and other fossils, and is believed to be\r\n  of Carboniferous age. In the sandstone Myophoria and other Triassic\r\n  fossils have been found, and it appears to belong to the Rhaetic or\r\n  Upper Trias.[1] The minerals produced are tin, gold, iron, galena and\r\n  others, in insignificant quantities.\r\n\r\n  The tin occurs in the form of cassiterite, and is found chiefly in or\r\n  near the crystalline rocks, especially the granite. As stream tin it\r\n  occurs abundantly in some of the alluvial deposits derived from the\r\n  crystalline area, especially on the west coast. Only two tin lodes are\r\n  worked, however, and both are situated on the east coast, the one at\r\n  Kuantan in Pahang, the other at Bandi in Trengganu territory. On the\r\n  west coast no true lode has yet been discovered, though the vast\r\n  alluvial deposits of tin found there seem to make such a discovery\r\n  probable in the future. Since 1890 the tin produced from these\r\n  alluvial beds has supplied between 50% and 75% of the tin of the\r\n  world. Gold is worked with success in Pahang, and has been exploited\r\n  from time immemorial by the natives of that state and of Kelantan.\r\n  Small quantities have also been found on the western slope in Perak.\r\n\r\n  _Climate, &c._--It was formerly the custom to speak of the Malay\r\n  Peninsula as an unhealthy climate, and even to compare it with the\r\n  west coast of Africa. It is now generally admitted, however, that,\r\n  though hot, it compares favourably with that of Burma. The chief\r\n  complaint which Europeans make concerning it is the extreme humidity,\r\n  which causes the heat to be more oppressive than is the case where the\r\n  air is dry. On the other hand, the thermometer, even at Singapore on\r\n  the southern coast, which is the hottest portion of the peninsula,\r\n  seldom rises above 98° in the shade, whereas the mean for the year at\r\n  that place is generally below 80°. On the mainland, and more\r\n  especially on the eastern slope, the temperature is cooler, the\r\n  thermometer seldom rising above 93° in the shade, and falling at night\r\n  below 70°. On an average day in this part of the peninsula the\r\n  temperature in a European house ranged from 88° to 68°. The number of\r\n  rainy days throughout the peninsula varies from 160 to over 200 in\r\n  each year, but violent gusts of wind, called \"Sumatras,\" accompanied\r\n  by a heavy downpour of short duration, are more common than persistent\r\n  rain. The rainfall on the west coast varies from 75 to 120 in. per\r\n  annum, and that of the east coast, where the north-east monsoon breaks\r\n  with all its fury, is usually about 155 in. per annum. Malarial fevers\r\n  make their appearance in places where the forest has been recently\r\n  felled, or where the surface earth has been disturbed. It is noticed\r\n  that labourers employed in deep mines worked by shafts suffer less\r\n  from fever than do those who are engaged in stripping the alluvial\r\n  deposits. This, of course, means that a new station, where clearing,\r\n  digging, and building are in progress, is often unhealthy for a time,\r\n  and to this must be attributed the evil reputation which the peninsula\r\n  formerly enjoyed. To Europeans the climate is found to be relaxing and\r\n  enervating, but if, in spite of some disinclination for exertion,\r\n  regular exercise is taken from the beginning, and ordinary precautions\r\n  against chills, more especially to the stomach, are adopted, a\r\n  European has almost as good a chance of remaining in good health in\r\n  the peninsula as in Europe. A change of climate, however, is\r\n  imperatively necessary every five or six years, and the children of\r\n  European parents should not be kept in the peninsula after they have\r\n  attained the age of four or five years. The Chinese immigrants suffer\r\n  chiefly from fever of a malarial type, from beri-beri, a species of\r\n  tropical dropsy, and from dysentery. The Malays formerly suffered\r\n  severely from smallpox epidemics, but in the portion of the peninsula\r\n  under British rule vaccination has been introduced, and the ravages of\r\n  the disease no longer assume serious dimensions. Occasional outbreaks\r\n  of cholera occur from time to time, and in the independent states\r\n  these cause terrible loss of life, as the natives fly from the disease\r\n  and spread the infection in every direction. As a whole, the Malays\r\n  are, however, a remarkably healthy people, and deformity and\r\n  hereditary diseases are rare among them. There is little leprosy in\r\n  the peninsula, but there is a leper hospital near Penang on Pula\r\n  Deraja and another on an island on the west coast for the reception of\r\n  lepers from the Federated Malay States.\r\n\r\n  _Flora and Fauna._--The soil of the peninsula is remarkably fertile\r\n  both in the plains and on the mountain slopes. In the vast forests the\r\n  decay of vegetable matter during countless ages has enriched the soil\r\n  to the depth of many feet, and from it springs the most marvellous\r\n  tangle of huge trees, shrubs, bushes, underwood, creepers, climbing\r\n  plants and trailing vines, the whole hung with ferns, mosses, and\r\n  parasitic growths, and bound together by rattans and huge rope-like\r\n  trailers. In most places the jungle is so dense that it is impossible\r\n  to force a way through it without the aid of a wood-knife, and even\r\n  the wild beasts use well-worn game-tracks through the forest. In the\r\n  interior brakes of bamboos are found, many of which spread for miles\r\n  along the river banks. Good hard-wood timber is found in plenty, the\r\n  best being the _merabau_, _penak_, _rasok_ and _chengal_. Orchids of\r\n  countless varieties abound. The principal fruit trees are the\r\n  _duri-an_, mangosteen, custard-apple, pomegranate, _rambut-an_,\r\n  _pulas-an_, _langsat_, _rambai_, jack-fruit, coco-nut, areca-nut,\r\n  sugar-palm, and banana. Coffee, tobacco, sugar-cane, rice, pepper,\r\n  gambier, cotton and sago are cultivated with success. Great\r\n  developments have been made of recent years in the cultivation of\r\n  rubber in British Malaya. The principal jungle products are gutta and\r\n  rubber of several varieties, and many kinds of rattan. The mangrove\r\n  grows on the shores of the west coast in profusion. Agilawood, the\r\n  camphor tree, and ebony are also found in smaller quantities.\r\n\r\n  The fauna of the peninsula is varied and no less profuse than is the\r\n  vegetable life. The Asiatic elephant; the _seladang_, a bison of a\r\n  larger type than the Indian gaur; two varieties of rhinoceros; the\r\n  honey bear (_bruang_), the tapir, the sambhur (_rusa_); the speckled\r\n  deer (_kijang_), three varieties of mouse-deer (_napoh_, _plandok_ and\r\n  _kanchil_); the gibbon (_ungka_ or _wawa'_), the _siamang_, another\r\n  species of anthropoid ape, the _brok_ or coco-nut monkey, so called\r\n  because it is trained by the Malays to gather the nuts from the\r\n  coco-nut trees, the _lotong_, _kra_, and at least twenty other kinds\r\n  of monkey; the _binturong_ (_arctictis binturong_), the lemur; the\r\n  Asiatic tiger, the black panther, the leopard, the large wild cat\r\n  (_harimau akar_), several varieties of jungle cat; the wild boar, the\r\n  wild dog; the flying squirrel, the flying fox; the python, the cobra,\r\n  and many other varieties of snake, including the hamadryad; the\r\n  alligator, the otter and the gavial, as well as countless kinds of\r\n  squirrel, rat, &c., are found throughout the jungles of the peninsula\r\n  in great numbers. On the east coast peafowl are found, and throughout\r\n  the interior the argus pheasant, the firebacked pheasant, the blue\r\n  partridge, the adjutant-bird, several kinds of heron and crane, duck,\r\n  teal, cotton-teal, snipe, wood-pigeon, green-pigeon of several\r\n  varieties, swifts, swallows, pied-robins, hornbills, parakeets,\r\n  fly-catchers, nightjars, and many other kinds of bird are met with\r\n  frequently. A few specimens of solitary goose have been procured, but\r\n  the bird is rarely met with. The forests literally swarm with insects\r\n  of all kinds, from _cicadae_ to beautiful butterflies, and from stick-\r\n  and leaf-insects to endless varieties of ants. The scorpion and the\r\n  centipede are both common. The study of the insect life of the\r\n  peninsula opens a splendid field for scientific research, and the\r\n  profusion and variety of insects found in these forests probably\r\n  surpass those to be met with anywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\n_Political Divisions and Population._--Politically the Malay Peninsula\r\nis divided into four sections: the colony of the Straits Settlements and\r\nthe Federated Malay States; the independent Malay State of Johor, which\r\nis within the British sphere of influence; the non-federated states\r\nunder British protection; and the groups of states to the north of Perak\r\nand Pahang which are now recognized as lying within the sphere of\r\ninfluence of Siam. The colony of the Straits Settlements consists of the\r\nislands of Singapore, Penang and the Dindings, the territory of Province\r\nWellesley, on the mainland opposite to Penang, the insignificant\r\nterritory of the Dindings, and the town and territory of Malacca. The\r\nFederated Malay States under British protection consist of the\r\nsultanates of Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sambilan on the west coast,\r\nand the sultanate of Pahang on the east coast. Johor is the only Malay\r\nstate in the southern portion of the peninsula, the whole of which is\r\nwithin the British sphere, which has been suffered to remain under\r\nnative rule. The non-federated states under British protection (since\r\n1909) are Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis (Palit). The population\r\nof the peninsula numbers about 2,000,000, of whom about 600,000 inhabit\r\nthe colony of the Straits Settlements, about 900,000 the Federated Malay\r\nStates, about 200,000 the Malay State of Johor, and about 250,000 to\r\n300,000 the remainder of the peninsula. The population of the peninsula\r\nincludes about 850,000 Chinese, mostly immigrants or descendants of\r\nimmigrants from the southern provinces of China, of whom about 300,000\r\nreside in the colony of the Straits Settlements, 365,000 in the\r\nFederated Malay States, 150,000 in Johor, and the remainder in smaller\r\ncommunities or as isolated traders scattered throughout the villages and\r\nsmall towns of the peninsula. The Malay population of the peninsula,\r\nincluding immigrants from the eastern archipelago, number some 750,000\r\nto 800,000, while the Tamils and other natives of India number about\r\n100,000, the aboriginal natives of the peninsula perhaps 20,000,\r\nEuropeans and Americans about 6500, and Eurasians about 9000. The colony\r\nof the Straits Settlements, and to a lesser extent the towns of the\r\nFederated Malay States, carry a considerable heterogenous population, in\r\nwhich most of the races of Asia find their representatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Malay Peninsula.]\r\n\r\n  _Races of the Peninsula._--Excluding the Tai, or Siamese, who are\r\n  undoubtedly recent intruders from the north, there are three races\r\n  which for an extended period of time have had their home in the Malay\r\n  Peninsula. These are the Semang or Pangan, the Sakai or Jakun, and the\r\n  Malays. The Semang, as they are most usually called by the Malays, are\r\n  Negritos--a small, very dark people, with features of the negroid\r\n  type, very prognathous, and with short, woolly hair clinging to the\r\n  scalp in tiny crisp curls. These people belong to the race which would\r\n  seem to be the true aboriginal stock of southern Asia. Representatives\r\n  of it are found scattered about the islands from the Andaman group\r\n  southwards. The state of civilization to which they have attained is\r\n  very low. They neither plant nor have they any manufactures except\r\n  their rude bamboo and rattan vessels, the fish and game traps which\r\n  they set with much skill, and the bows, blow-pipes and bamboo spears\r\n  with which they are armed. They are skilful hunters, however, catch\r\n  fish by ingeniously constructed traps, and live almost entirely on\r\n  jungle-roots and the produce of their hunting and fishing. The most\r\n  civilized of these people is found in Upper Perak, and the members of\r\n  this clan have acquired some knowledge of the art of planting, &c.\r\n  They cannot, however, be taken as typical of their race, and other\r\n  specimens of this people are seldom seen even by the Sakai. From time\r\n  to time they have been raided by the latter, and many Negritos are to\r\n  be found in captivity in some of the Malayan villages on the eastern\r\n  side of the peninsula. The mistake of speaking of the Sakai tribes as\r\n  practically identical with the Semang or Pangan has very frequently\r\n  been made, but as a matter of fact the two races are absolutely\r\n  distinct from one another. It has also been customary to include the\r\n  Sakai in the category of Malayan races, but this too is undoubtedly\r\n  incorrect. The Sakai still inhabit in greatest numbers the country\r\n  which forms the interior of Pahang, the Plus and Kinta districts of\r\n  Perak, and the valley of Nenggiri in Kelantan. Representatives of\r\n  their race are also found scattered among the Malayan villages\r\n  throughout the country, and also along the coast, but these have\r\n  intermixed so much with the Malays, and have acquired so many customs,\r\n  &c., from their more civilized neighbours, that they can no longer be\r\n  regarded as typical of the race to which they belong. The pure Sakai\r\n  in the interior have a good knowledge of planting rice, tapioca, &c.,\r\n  fashion pretty vessels from bamboos, which they decorate with patterns\r\n  traced by the aid of fire, make loin-cloths (their only garment) from\r\n  the bark of the _trap_ and _ipoh_ trees; are very musical, using a\r\n  rude lute of bamboo, and a nose-flute of a very sweet tone, and\r\n  singing in chorus very melodiously; and altogether have attained in\r\n  their primitive state to a higher degree of civilization than have the\r\n  Semang. They are about as tall as the average Malay, are slimly built,\r\n  light of colour, and have wavy fine hair. In their own language they\r\n  usually have only three numerals, viz. _na-nun_, one; _nar_, two; and\r\n  _ne'_, three, or variants of these; all higher arithmetical ideas\r\n  being expressed by the word _kerpn_, which means \"many.\" A few cases\r\n  have been recorded, however, of tribes who can count in their own\r\n  tongue up to four and five. Among the more civilized, however, the\r\n  Malay numerals up to ten are adopted by the Sakai. An examination of\r\n  their language seems to indicate that it belongs to the Mon-Khmer\r\n  group of languages, and the anthropological information forthcoming\r\n  concerning the Sakai points to the conclusion that they show a greater\r\n  affinity to the people of the Mon-Khmer races than to the Malayan\r\n  stock. Though they now use metal tools imported by the Malays, it is\r\n  noticeable that the names which they give to those weapons which most\r\n  closely resemble in character the stone implements found in such\r\n  numbers all over the peninsula are native names wholly unconnected\r\n  with their Malay equivalents. On account of this, it has been\r\n  suggested that in a forgotten past the Sakai were themselves the\r\n  fashioners of the stone implements, and certain it is that all tools\r\n  which have no representatives among the stone kelts are known to the\r\n  Sakai by obvious corruptions of their Malayan names. The presence of\r\n  the Sakai, a people of the Mon-Khmer stock, in the interior of the\r\n  peninsula has also been considered as one of many proofs that the\r\n  Malays intruded from the south and approached the peninsula by means\r\n  of a sea-route, since had they swept down from the north, being driven\r\n  thence by the people of a stronger breed, it might be expected that\r\n  the fringe of country dividing the two contending races would be\r\n  inhabited by men of the more feeble stock. Instead, we find the Sakai\r\n  occupying this position, thus indicating that they have been driven\r\n  northward by the Malays, and that the latter people has not been\r\n  expelled by the Mon-Khmer races from the countries now represented by\r\n  Burma, Siam and French Indo-China. The Sakai population is dying out,\r\n  and must eventually disappear. (With regard to the Malay, see MALAYS.)\r\n\r\n  _Archaeology._--The only ancient remains found in the peninsula are\r\n  the stone implements, of which mention has already been made, and some\r\n  remarkable ancient mines, which are situated in the Jelai valley in\r\n  Pahang. The stone implements are generally of one or two types: a long\r\n  rectangular adze or wedge rudely pointed at one end, and used in\r\n  conjunction with a mallet or flat stone, and a roughly triangular\r\n  axe-head, which has evidently been fixed in the cleft of a split\r\n  stick. A few stones, which might perhaps be arrowheads, have been\r\n  found, but they are very rare. The mines, which have been constructed\r\n  for the purpose of working quartz lodes containing gold, are very\r\n  extensive, and argue a high stage of civilization possessed by the\r\n  ancient miners. They consist of a number of circular or rectangular\r\n  pits sunk from the cap of a hill, and going down to a depth of in some\r\n  cases as much as 120 ft., until in fact the miners have been stopped\r\n  by being unable to cope with the quantity of water made when the level\r\n  of the valley was reached. The shafts are placed so close together\r\n  that in many instances they are divided by only a couple of feet of\r\n  solid ground, but at their bases a considerable amount of gallery work\r\n  has been excavated, though it is possible that this was done by miners\r\n  who came after the people who originally sank the shafts. Native\r\n  tradition attributes these mines to the Siamese, but no importance can\r\n  be attached to this, as it is very general for the Malays to give this\r\n  explanation for anything which is obviously not the work of their own\r\n  ancestors. A theory, which seems to have some probability in its\r\n  favour, is that these mines were worked by the Khmer people during the\r\n  period of power, energy and prosperity which found its most lofty\r\n  expression in the now ruined and deserted city of Angkor Thom; while\r\n  another attributes these works to the natives of India whose Hindu\r\n  remains are found in Java and elsewhere, whose influence was at one\r\n  time widespread throughout Malayan lands, and of whose religious\r\n  teaching remnants still linger in the superstitions of the Malays and\r\n  are preserved in some purity in Lombok and Bali. In the absence,\r\n  however, of any relics of a kind which might lead to the\r\n  identification of the ancient miners, their nationality and origin are\r\n  matters which must continue to be mere questions of speculation and\r\n  conjecture.\r\n\r\n_History._--The first hint to reach Europe concerning the existence of\r\nhabitable lands to the eastward of the Ganges is to be found in the\r\nwritings of Pomponius Mela (A.D. 43) which speak of Chryse, or the\r\nGolden Isle, as lying off Cape Tamus--supposed to be the most easterly\r\npoint in Asia--and over against the estuary of the Ganges. Thereafter\r\nthere occur vague references to Chryse in the _Periplus of the Erythrean\r\nSea_, &c., but the earliest trace of anything resembling first-hand\r\nknowledge concerning the peninsula of Indo-China and Malaya is revealed\r\nin the writings of Ptolemy, whose views were mainly derived from those\r\nof his predecessor Marinus of Tyre, who in his turn drew his deductions\r\nfrom information supplied to him by the mariner Alexander who, there is\r\nevery reason to think, had himself voyaged to the Malay Peninsula and\r\nbeyond. In the light of present knowledge concerning the trade-routes of\r\nAsia, which had been in existence for thousands of years ere ever\r\nEuropeans attempted to make use of them, it is safe to identify\r\nPtolemy's Sinus Perimulicus with the Gulf of Siam, the Sinus Sabaricus\r\nwith the Straits of Malacca from their southern portals to the Gulf of\r\nMartaban, the Aurea Chersonesus with the Malay Peninsula, and the island\r\nof Iabadius or Sabadius--the reading of the name is doubtful--with\r\nSumatra, not as has often been mistakenly attempted with Java. Although\r\nthe first definite endeavour to locate the Golden Chersonese thus dates\r\nfrom the middle of the 2nd century of our era, the name was apparently\r\nwell known to the learned of Europe at a somewhat earlier period, and in\r\nhis _Antiquities of the Jews_, written during the latter half of the 1st\r\ncentury, Josephus says that Solomon gave to the pilots furnished to him\r\nby Hiram of Tyre commands \"that they should go along with his stewards\r\nto the land that of old was called Ophir, but now the Aurea Chersonesus,\r\nwhich belongs to India, to fetch gold.\" After the time of Ptolemy no\r\nadvance in knowledge concerning the geography of south-eastern Asia was\r\nmade until Cosmas Indicopleustes, a monk and an Alexandrian Greek, wrote\r\nfrom personal knowledge between A.D. 530 and 550. His primary object was\r\nto prove that the world was built after the same shape and fashion as\r\nthe Ark made by the Children of Israel in the desert; but he was able to\r\nshow that the Malay Peninsula had to be rounded and thereafter a course\r\nsteered in a northerly direction if China was to be reached. Meanwhile\r\ninter-Asiatic intercourse by means of sea-routes had been steadily on\r\nthe increase since the discovery of the way to utilize the monsoons and\r\nto sail directly to and fro across the Indian Ocean (attributed to the\r\nGreek pilot Hippalus) had been made. After the decline of the power of\r\nRome, the dominant force in Asiatic commerce and navigation was Persia,\r\nand from that time onward, until the arrival of the Portuguese upon the\r\nscene early in the 16th century the spice trade, whose chief emporia\r\nwere in or near the Malay Peninsula, was in Persian or Arab hands.\r\nThere is considerable reason to think, however, that the more frequent\r\nports of call in the Straits of Malacca were situated in Sumatra, rather\r\nthan on the shores of the Malay Peninsula, and two famous medieval\r\ntravellers, Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta, both called and wintered at the\r\nformer, and make scant mention of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the Malay Peninsula, as has been noted, consisted in\r\nthe privilege which its locality conferred upon it of being the\r\ndistributing centre of the spices brought thither from the Moluccas _en\r\nroute_ for India and Europe. As early as the 3rd century B.C.\r\nMegasthenes makes mention of spices brought to the shores of the Ganges\r\nfrom \"the southern parts of India,\" and the trade in question was\r\nprobably one of the most ancient in the world. So long, however, as\r\nIndia held the monopoly of the clove, the Malay Peninsula was ignored,\r\nthe Hindus spreading their influence through the islands of the\r\narchipelago and leaving traces thereof even to this day. The Mahommedan\r\ntraders from Persia and Arabia, following the routes which had been\r\nprepared for them by their forebears, broke down the Hindu monopoly and\r\nousted the earlier exploiters so effectually that by the beginning of\r\nthe 16th century the spice trade was almost exclusively in their hands.\r\nThese traders were also missionaries of their religion, as indeed is\r\nevery Mahommedan, and to them is due the conversion of the Malays from\r\nrude pantheism, somewhat tinctured by Hindu mythology, to the Mahommedan\r\ncreed. The desire to obtain the monopoly of the spice trade has been a\r\npotent force in the fashioning of Asiatic history. The Moluccas were,\r\nfrom the first, the objective of the Portuguese invaders, and no sooner\r\nhad the white men found their way round the Cape of Good Hope and\r\nestablished themselves successively upon the coast of East Africa, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Gulf of Aden and the Malabar coast, than\r\nMalacca, then the chief trading centre of the Malayan Archipelago,\r\nbecame the object of their desire. The first Portuguese expedition sent\r\nout to capture Malacca was under the command of Diogo Lopez de Siqueira\r\nand sailed from Portugal in 1508. At Cochin Siqueira took on board\r\ncertain adherents of Alphonso d'Alboquerque who were in bad odour with\r\nhis rival d'Almeida, among them being Magellan, the future\r\ncircumnavigator of the world, and Francisco Serrão, the first European\r\nwho ever lived in the Spice Islands. Siqueira's expedition ended in\r\nfailure, owing partly to the aggressive attitude of the Portuguese,\r\npartly to the very justifiable suspicions of the Malays, and he was\r\npresently forced to destroy one of his vessels, to leave a number of his\r\nmen in captivity, and to sail direct for Portugal. In 1510 a second\r\nexpedition against Malacca was sent out from Portugal under the command\r\nof Diogo Mendez de Vasconcellos, but d'Alboquerque retained it at Cochin\r\nto aid him in the retaking of Goa, and it was not until 1511 that the\r\ngreat viceroy could spare time to turn his attention to the scene of\r\nSiqueira's failure. After some futile negotiations, which had for their\r\nobject the recovery of the Portuguese captives before hostilities should\r\nbegin, an assault was delivered upon Malacca, and though the first\r\nattempt to take the city failed after some hard fighting, a second\r\nassault made some days later succeeded, and Malacca passed for ever into\r\nEuropean hands. The Portuguese were satisfied with the possession of\r\nMalacca itself and did not seek further to extend their empire in\r\nMalaya. Instead they used every endeavour to establish friendly\r\nrelations with the rulers of all the neighbouring kingdoms, and before\r\nd'Alboquerque returned to India he despatched embassies to China, Siam,\r\nand several kingdoms of Sumatra, and sent a small fleet, with orders to\r\nassume a highly conciliatory attitude toward all natives, in search of\r\nthe Moluccas. Very soon the spice trade had become a Portuguese\r\nmonopoly, and Malacca was the great headquarters of the trade. It should\r\nmoreover be noted that Magellan's famous expedition had for its object\r\nnot the barren feat of circumnavigation but the breaking down of this\r\nmonopoly, without violating the terms of the papal bull which gave to\r\nSpain the conquest of the West, to Portugal the possession of the East.\r\nIn 1528 a French expedition sailed from Dieppe, penetrated as far as\r\nAchin in Sumatra, but returned without reaching the Malay Peninsula. It\r\nwas, however, the first attempt ever made to defy the papal bull. In\r\n1591, three years after the defeat of the Armada, Raymond and Lancaster\r\nrounded the Cape, and after cruising off Penang, decided to winter in\r\nAchin. They subsequently hid among the Pulau Sambilan near the mouth of\r\nthe Perak river, and thence captured a large Portuguese vessel which was\r\nsailing from Malacca in company with two Burmese ships. In 1595 the\r\nfirst Dutch expedition sailed from the Texel, but it took a more\r\nsoutherly course than its predecessors and confined its operations to\r\nJava and the neighbouring islands. During this period Achin developed a\r\ndetermined enmity to the Portuguese, and more than one attempt was made\r\nto drive the strangers from Malacca. Eventually, in 1641, a joint attack\r\nwas made by the Achinese and the Dutch, but the latter, not the people\r\nof the sturdy little Sumatran kingdom, became the owners of the coveted\r\nport. Malacca was taken from the Dutch by the British in 1795; was\r\nrestored to the latter in 1818; but in 1824 was exchanged for Benkulen\r\nand a few more unimportant places in Sumatra. The first British factory\r\nin the peninsula was established in the native state of Patani on the\r\neast coast in 1613, the place having been used by the Portuguese in the\r\n16th century for a similar purpose; but the enterprise came to an\r\nuntimely end in 1620 when Captain Jourdain, the first president, was\r\nkilled in a naval engagement in Patani Roads by the Dutch. Penang was\r\npurchased from Kedah in 1786, and Singapore from the then sultan of\r\nJohor in 1819. The Straits Settlements--Singapore, Malacca and\r\nPenang--were ruled from India until 1867, when they were erected into a\r\ncrown colony under the charge of the Colonial Office. In 1874 the Malay\r\nstate of Perak was placed under British protection by a treaty entered\r\ninto with its sultan; and this eventually led to the inclusion in a\r\nBritish protectorate of the neighbouring Malay States of Selangor,\r\nSungei Ujong, the cluster of small states called the Negri Sembilan and\r\nPahang, which now form the Federated Malay States. By a treaty made\r\nbetween Great Britain and Siam in 1902 the northern Malay states of the\r\npeninsula were admitted to lie within the Siamese sphere of influence,\r\nbut by a treaty of 1909 Siam ceded her suzerain rights over the states\r\nof Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis to Britain.\r\n\r\nSingapore is the political, commercial and administrative headquarters\r\nof the colony of the Straits Settlements, and the governor for the time\r\nbeing is _ex officio_ high commissioner of the Federated Malay States,\r\nBritish North Borneo, Sarawak, the Cocos-Keeling and Christmas Islands,\r\nand governor of Labuan.\r\n\r\n  See Sir F.

Broadly speaking, all the\r\nbrown races which inhabit the portion of Asia south of Siam and\r\nIndo-China, and the islands from the Philippines to Java, and from\r\nSumatra to Timor, may be described as belonging to the Malayan family,\r\nif the aboriginal tribes, such as the Sakai and Semang in the Malay\r\nPeninsula, the Bataks in Sumatra, and the Muruts in Borneo, be excepted.\r\nFor the purposes of this article, however, only those among these races\r\nwhich bear the name of Orang Malayu, speak the Malayan language, and\r\nrepresent the dominant people of the land, can be included under the\r\ntitle of Malays. These people inhabit the whole of the Malayan Peninsula\r\nto the borders of lower Siam, the islands in the vicinity of the\r\nmainland, the shores of Sumatra and some portions of the interior of\r\nthat island, Sarawak and Brunei in Borneo, and some parts of Dutch\r\nBorneo, Batavia and certain districts in Java, and some of the smaller\r\nislands of the archipelago. Though in these lands they have for not less\r\nthan a thousand years enjoyed the position of the dominant race, they\r\nall possess a tradition that they are not indigenous, and that their\r\nfirst rulers \"came out of the sea,\" with a large band of Malayan\r\nwarriors in their train. In the peninsula especially, where the\r\npresence of the Malays is more recent than elsewhere, many traditions\r\nexist which point to a comparatively recent occupation of the country.\r\nIt has been remarked that there is evidence that the Malays had attained\r\nto a certain stage of civilization before ever they set foot in Malaya.\r\nFor instance, the names which they give to certain fruits, such as the\r\n_duri-an_, the _rambut-an_ and the _pulas-an_, which are indigenous in\r\nthe Malayan countries, and are not found elsewhere, are all compound\r\nwords meaning respectively the thorny, the hairy and the twisted fruit.\r\nThese words are formed by the addition of the substantial affix \"-_an_,\"\r\nthe use of which is one of the recognized methods by which the Malays\r\nturn primitive words into terms of more complex meaning. This may be\r\ntaken to indicate that when first the Malays became acquainted with the\r\nfruits which are indigenous in Malayan lands they already possessed a\r\nlanguage in which most primary words were represented, and also that\r\ntheir tongue had attained to a stage of development which provided for\r\nthe formation of compound words by a system sanctioned by custom and the\r\nsame linguistic instinct which causes a Malay to-day to form similar\r\ncompounds from European and other foreign roots. For any aboriginal race\r\ninhabiting these countries, such important articles of diet as the\r\n_duri-an_, &c., could not fail to be among the first natural objects to\r\nreceive a name, and thus we find primary terms in use among the Sakai\r\nand Semang, the aborigines of the Peninsula, to describe these fruits.\r\nThe use by the Malays of artificially constructed terms to denote these\r\nthings may certainly be taken to strengthen the opinion that the Malays\r\narrived in the lands they now inhabit at a comparatively late period in\r\ntheir history, and at a time when they had developed considerably from\r\nthe original state of primitive man.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Peninsula itself there is abundant evidence, ethnological\r\nand philological, of at least two distinct immigrations of people of the\r\nMalayan stock, the earlier incursions, it is probable, taking place from\r\nthe eastern archipelago to the south, the later invasion spreading\r\nacross the Straits of Malacca from Sumatra at a comparatively recent\r\ndate. The fact that the semi-wild tribes, which are ethnologically\r\nMalayan and distinct from the aboriginal Semang and Sakai, are met with\r\nalmost invariably in the neighbourhood of the coast would seem to\r\nindicate that they reached the peninsula by a sea, not by a land route,\r\na supposition which is strengthened by their almost amphibious habits.\r\nMany of these tribes have retained their pristine paganism, but many\r\nothers it is certain have adopted the Mahommedan religion and have been\r\nassimilated by the subsequent and stronger wave of Sumatran immigrants.\r\nA study of the local dialects to be met with in some of the districts of\r\nthe far interior, e.g. the Tembeling valley in Pahang, whose people are\r\nnow Mahommedans and in many respects indistinguishable from the ordinary\r\nMalays of the peninsula, reveals the fact that words, current in the\r\narchipelago to the south but incomprehensible to the average peninsula\r\nMalays, by whom these more ancient populations are now completely\r\nsurrounded, have been preserved as local words, whereas they really\r\nbelong to an older dialect once spoken widely in the peninsula, as\r\nto-day it is spoken in the Malayan islands. This would seem to show that\r\nin some instances the earlier Malay immigrants fell or were driven by\r\nthe later invaders back from the coast and sought refuge in the far\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Theories of Origin.\r\n\r\nUntil recently many eminent scientists held the theory that the Malayan\r\npeoples were merely an offspring of the Mongol stock, and that their\r\nadvance into the lands they now inhabit had taken place from the cradle\r\nof the Mongolian race--that is to say, from the north. In the fifth\r\nedition of his _Malay Archipelago_, A. R. Wallace notes the resemblance\r\nwhich he traced between the Malays and the Mongolians, and others have\r\nrecorded similar observations as to the physical appearance of the two\r\nraces. To-day, however, fuller data are available than when Wallace\r\nwrote, and the more generally accepted theory is that the Malayan race\r\nis distinct, and came from the south, until it was stayed by the\r\nMongolian races living on the mainland of southern Asia. The cranial\r\nmeasurements of the Malays and an examination of their hair sections\r\nseem to bear out the theory that they are distinct from the Mongolian\r\nraces. Their language, which is neither monosyllabic nor tonic, has\r\nnothing in common with that of the Mon-Annam group. It has, moreover,\r\nbeen pointed out that had the Malays been driven southwards by the\r\nstronger races of the mainland of Asia, it might be expected that the\r\npeople inhabiting the country nearest to the border between Siam and\r\nMalaya would belong to the Malayan and not to the Mon-Annam or Mon-Khmer\r\nstock. As a matter of fact the Sâkai of the interior of the peninsula\r\nbelong to the latter race. It might also be anticipated, were the theory\r\nof a southward immigration to be sustained, that the Malays would be\r\nnew-comers in the islands of the archipelago, and have their oldest\r\nsettlements on the Malayan Peninsula. The facts, however, are in exact\r\ncontradiction to this; and accordingly the theory now most generally\r\nheld by those who have studied the question is that the Malays form a\r\ndistinct race, and had their original home in the south. Where this home\r\nlay it is not easy to say, but the facts recorded by many writers as to\r\nthe resemblance between the Polynesian and the Malayan races, and the\r\nstrong Malayan element found in the languages of the former (see\r\nTregear's _Maori and Comparative Polynesian Dictionary_, London, 1891),\r\nhave led some students to think that the two races may have had a common\r\norigin. John Crawfurd, in the Dissertation to his _Dictionary of the\r\nMalay Language_, published in 1840, noted the prevalence of Malayan\r\nterms in the Polynesian languages, and attributed the fact to the\r\ncasting away of ships manned by Malays upon the islands of the\r\nPolynesian Archipelago. The appearance of the same Malayan words in\r\nlocalities so widely separated from each other, however, cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for by any such explanation, and the theory is\r\nnow more generally held that the two races are probably allied and may\r\nat some remote period of history have shared a common home. It has been\r\nsuggested that their separation did not take place until after the\r\ncontinent which once existed in the north Pacific had become submerged,\r\nand that the Malays wandered northward, while the Polynesian race spread\r\nitself over the islands of the southern archipelago. All this, however,\r\nmust necessarily be of the nature of the purest speculation, and the\r\nonly facts which we are able to deduce in the present state of our\r\nknowledge of the subject may be summed up as follows: (a) That the\r\nMalays ethnologically belong to a race which is allied to the\r\nPolynesians; (b) that the theory formerly current to the effect that the\r\nSakai and other similar races of the peninsula and archipelago belonged\r\nto the Malayan stock cannot be maintained, since recent investigations\r\ntend to identify them with the Mon-Annam or Mon-Khmer family of races;\r\n(c) that the Malays are, comparatively speaking, new-comers in the lands\r\nwhich they now inhabit; (d) that it is almost certain that their\r\nemigration took place from the south; (e) and that, at some remote\r\nperiod of their history, they came into close contact with the\r\nPolynesian race, probably before its dispersion over the extensive area\r\nwhich it now occupies.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Religion and Superstitions.\r\n\r\n  The Malays to-day are Sunni Mahommedans of the school of Shafi'i, and\r\n  they habitually use the terms _Orang Malayu_, i.e. a Malay, and _Orang\r\n  Islam_, i.e. a Mahommedan, as synonymous expressions. Their conversion\r\n  from paganism took place during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries of\r\n  our era. The raja of Achin, in northern Sumatra, is said to have been\r\n  converted as early as 1206, while the Bugis people in Celebes are\r\n  supposed not to have become Mahommedans until 1495. Mahommedanism\r\n  undoubtedly spread to the Malays of the peninsula from Sumatra, but\r\n  their conversion was slow and gradual, and may even now in some\r\n  respects be regarded as imperfect. Upon the bulk of the Malayan\r\n  peoples their religion sits but lightly. Few are found to observe the\r\n  law concerning the Five Hours of Prayer, and many fail to put in an\r\n  appearance at the Friday congregational services in the mosques. The\r\n  Fast of Ramadhan, however, is generally observed with some\r\n  faithfulness. Compared with other Mahommedan peoples, the Malays are\r\n  not fanatical, though occasionally an outbreak against those of a\r\n  different creed is glorified by them into a holy war. The reason of\r\n  such outbreaks, however, is usually to be found in political and\r\n  social rather than in religious grievances. Prior to their conversion\r\n  to Mahommedanism the Malays were subjected to a considerable Hindu\r\n  influence, which reached them by means of the traders who visited the\r\n  archipelago from India. In the islands of Bali and Lombok the people\r\n  still profess a form of Hinduism, and Hindu remains are to be found in\r\n  many other parts of the archipelago, though their traces do not extend\r\n  to the peninsula. Throughout, however, the superstitions of the Malays\r\n  show indications of this Hindu influence, and many of the demons whom\r\n  their medicine-men invoke in their magic practices are clearly\r\n  borrowed from the pantheon of India. For the rest, a substratum of\r\n  superstitious beliefs, which survives from the days when the Malays\r\n  professed only their natural religion, is to be found firmly rooted in\r\n  the minds of the people, and the influence of Mahommedanism, which\r\n  regards such things with horror, has been powerless to eradicate this.\r\n  Mr W. W. Skeat's _Malay Magic_ (London, 1900) is a compilation of all\r\n  the writings on the subject of Malay superstitions by the best\r\n  authorities and contains considerable original matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mode of Life, &c.\r\n\r\n  The Malays of the coast are a maritime people, and were long famous\r\n  for the daring character of their acts of piracy. They are now\r\n  peaceable fisher-folk, who show considerable ingenuity in their\r\n  calling. Inland the Malays live by preference on the banks of rivers,\r\n  building houses on piles some feet from the ground, and planting\r\n  groves of coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar-palm and fruit-trees around their\r\n  dwellings. Behind their villages the rice-fields usually spread, and\r\n  rice, which is the staple food of the people, is the principal article\r\n  of agriculture among them. Sugar-cane, maize, tapioca and other\r\n  similar products are grown, however, in smaller quantities. In\r\n  planting rice three methods are in use: the cultivation of swamp-rice\r\n  in irrigated fields; the planting of ploughed areas; and the planting\r\n  of hill-rice by sowing each grain separately in holes bored for the\r\n  purpose. In the irrigated fields the rice plants are first grown in\r\n  nurseries, and are subsequently transplanted when they have reached a\r\n  certain stage of development. The Malays also work jungle produce, of\r\n  which the most important are gutta, rattans, agila wood, camphor wood,\r\n  and the beautiful _kamuning_ wood which is used by the natives for the\r\n  hilts of their weapons. The principal manufactures of the Malays are\r\n  cotton and silk cloths, earthenware and silver vessels, mats and\r\n  native weapons. The best cotton cloths are those manufactured by the\r\n  Bugis people in Celebes, and the _batek_ cloths which come from Java\r\n  and are stamped with patterns. The best silks are produced by the\r\n  natives of Pahang, Kelantan and Johor in the Malay Peninsula. Lord\r\n  Leighton pronounced the silver ware from Malaya to be the most\r\n  artistic of any exhibited at the Colonial Exhibition held in London in\r\n  1886. The pottery of the Malays is rude but curious. When the first\r\n  Europeans visited the Malay Archipelago the Malays had already\r\n  acquired the art of manufacturing gunpowder and forging cannon. The\r\n  art of writing also appears to have been independently invented by the\r\n  Malayan races, since numerous alphabets are in use among the peoples\r\n  of the archipelago, although for the writing of Malay itself the\r\n  Arabic character has been adopted for some hundreds of years. The\r\n  Malays are excellent boat-builders.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Character, &c.\r\n\r\n  While the Malays were famous almost exclusively for their piratical\r\n  expeditions they naturally bore an evil reputation among Europeans,\r\n  but now that we have come into closer contact with them, and have\r\n  learned to understand them better, the old opinions concerning them\r\n  have been greatly modified. They used to be described as the most\r\n  cruel and treacherous people in the world, and they certainly are\r\n  callous of the pain suffered by others, and regard any strategy of\r\n  which their enemies are the victims with open admiration. In ordinary\r\n  circumstances, however, the Malay is not treacherous, and there are\r\n  many instances recorded in which men of this race have risked their\r\n  own lives on behalf of Europeans who chanced to be their friends. As a\r\n  race they are exceedingly courteous and self-respecting. Their own\r\n  code of manners is minute and strict, and they observe its provisions\r\n  faithfully. Unlike many Orientals, the Malays can be treated with a\r\n  friendly familiarity without such treatment breeding lack of respect\r\n  or leading to liberties being taken with the superior. The Malays are\r\n  indolent, pleasure-loving, improvident beyond belief, fond of bright\r\n  clothing, of comfort, of ease, and they dislike toil exceedingly. They\r\n  have no idea of the value of money, and little notion of honesty where\r\n  money is concerned. They would always borrow rather than earn money,\r\n  and they feel no shame in adopting the former course. They will\r\n  frequently refuse to work for a wage when they most stand in need of\r\n  cash, and yet at the invitation of one who is their friend they will\r\n  toil unremittingly without any thought of reward. They are much\r\n  addicted to gambling, and formerly were much given to fighting, though\r\n  they never display that passion for war in the abstract which is\r\n  characteristic of some of the white races, and their courage on the\r\n  whole is not high if judged by European standards. It is notorious,\r\n  however, on the coasts that a Malay gang on board a ship invariably\r\n  gets the better of any fight which may arise between it and the\r\n  Chinese crew. The sexual morality of the Malays is very lax, but\r\n  prostitution is not common in consequence. Polygamy, though allowed by\r\n  their religion, is practised for the most part among the wealthy\r\n  classes only. The Malays are an intensely aristocratic people, and\r\n  show a marvellous loyalty to their rajas and chiefs. Their respect for\r\n  rank is not marred by any vulgarity or snobbery. The ruling classes\r\n  among them display all the vices of the lower classes, and few of the\r\n  virtues except that of courtesy. They are for the most part, when\r\n  left to their own resources, cruel, unjust, selfish and improvident.\r\n\r\n  Much has been written concerning the acts of homicidal mania called\r\n  amuck (_amok_), which word in the vernacular means to attack. It was\r\n  formerly believed that these outbursts were to be attributed to\r\n  madness _pur et simple_, and some cases of _amok_ can certainly be\r\n  traced to this source. These are not, however, in any sense typical,\r\n  and might equally have been perpetrated by men of another race. The\r\n  typical _amok_ is usually the result of circumstances which render a\r\n  Malay desperate. The motive is often inadequate from the point of view\r\n  of a European, but to the Malay it is sufficient to make him weary of\r\n  life and anxious to court death. Briefly, where a man of another race\r\n  might not improbably commit suicide, a Malay runs _amok_, killing all\r\n  whom he may meet until he himself is slain.\r\n\r\n  The nervous affliction called _latah_, to which many Malays are\r\n  subject, is also a curious trait of the people. The victims of this\r\n  affliction lose for the time all self-control and all sense of their\r\n  own identity, imitating the actions of any person who chances to rivet\r\n  their attention. Accounts of these manifestations will be found in\r\n  Swettenham's _Malay Sketches_ (London, 1895) and Clifford's _Studies\r\n  in Brown Humanity_ (London, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Costume, Weapons, &c.\r\n\r\n  The Malays wear a loose coat and trousers, and a cap or head-kerchief,\r\n  but the characteristic item of their costume is the _sarong_, a silk\r\n  or cotton cloth about two yards long by a yard and a quarter wide, the\r\n  ends of which are sewn together, forming a kind of skirt. This is worn\r\n  round the waist folded in a knot, the women allowing it to fall to the\r\n  ankle, the men, when properly dressed in accordance with ancient\r\n  custom, folding it over the hilt of their waist-weapon, and draping it\r\n  around them so that it reaches nearly to the knee. In the hall of a\r\n  raja on state occasions a head-kerchief twisted into a peak is worn,\r\n  and the coat is furnished with a high collar extending round the back\r\n  of the neck only. This coat is open in front, leaving the chest bare.\r\n  The trousers are short and of a peculiar cut and material, being\r\n  coloured many hues in parallel horizontal lines. The _sarong_ is of\r\n  Celebes manufacture and made of cotton, to the surface of which a high\r\n  polish is imparted by friction with a shell. The typical fighting\r\n  costume of the Malay is a sleeveless jacket with texts from the Koran\r\n  written upon it, short tight drawers reaching to the middle of the\r\n  thigh, and the _sarong_ is then bound tightly around the waist,\r\n  leaving the hilt of the dagger worn in the girdle exposed to view. The\r\n  principal weapon of the Malays is the _kris_, a short dagger with a\r\n  small wooden or ivory handle, of which there are many varieties. The\r\n  blade of a _kris_ may either be wavy or straight, but if wavy the\r\n  number of waves must always be uneven in number. The _kris_ most\r\n  prized by the Malays are those of Bugis (Celebes) manufacture, and of\r\n  these the kind called _tuasek_ are of the greatest value. Besides the\r\n  short _kris_, the Malays use long straight _kris_ with very narrow\r\n  blades, shorter straight _kris_ of the same form, short broad swords\r\n  called _sundang_, long swords of ordinary pattern called _pedang_,\r\n  somewhat shorter swords curved like scimitars with curiously carved\r\n  handles called _chenangkas_, and short stabbing daggers called _tumbok\r\n  lada_. The principal tools of the Malays are the _parang_ or _gôlok_,\r\n  a heavy knife used in the jungle, without which no peasant ever stirs\r\n  abroad from his house, the _beliong_ or native axe, and the _pisau\r\n  raut_, which is used for scraping rattan. Their implements are very\r\n  primitive, consisting of a plough fashioned from a fork of a tree, and\r\n  a rude harrow. Reaping is usually performed by the aid of a curious\r\n  little knife which severs each ear of grain separately. The\r\n  fisher-folk use many kinds of nets, which they manufacture themselves.\r\n  Sails, paddles, oars and punting-poles are all in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MALAY LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  The Malay language is a member of the Malayan section of the\r\n  Malayo-Polynesian class of languages, but it is by no means a\r\n  representative type of the section which has taken its name from it.\r\n  The area over which it is spoken comprises the peninsula of Malacca\r\n  with the adjacent islands (the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago), the greater\r\n  part of the coast districts of Sumatra and Borneo, the seaports of\r\n  Java, the Sunda and Banda Islands. It is the general medium of\r\n  communication throughout the archipelago from Sumatra to the\r\n  Philippine Islands, and it was so upwards of three hundred and fifty\r\n  years ago when the Portuguese first appeared in those parts.\r\n\r\n  There are no Malay manuscripts extant, no monumental records with\r\n  inscriptions in Malay, dating from before the spreading of Islam in\r\n  the archipelago, about the end of the 13th century. By some it has\r\n  been argued from this fact that the Malays possessed no kind of\r\n  writing prior to the introduction of the Arabic alphabet (W. Robinson,\r\n  J. J. de Hollander); whereas others have maintained, with greater show\r\n  of probability, that the Malays were in possession of an ancient\r\n  alphabet, and that it was the same as the Rechang (Marsden,\r\n  Friederich), as the Kawi (Van der Tuuk), or most like the Lampong\r\n  (Kern)--all of which alphabets, with the Battak, Bugi and Macassar,\r\n  are ultimately traceable to the ancient Cambojan characters. With the\r\n  Mahommedan conquest the Perso-Arabic alphabet was introduced among the\r\n  Malays; it has continued ever since to be in use for literary,\r\n  religious and business purposes. Where Javanese is the principal\r\n  language, Malay is sometimes found written with Javanese characters;\r\n  and in Palembang, in the Menangkabo country of Middle Sumatra, the\r\n  Rechang or Renchong characters are in general use, so called from the\r\n  sharp and pointed knife with which they are cut on the smooth side of\r\n  bamboo staves. It is only since the Dutch have established their\r\n  supremacy in the archipelago that the Roman character has come to be\r\n  largely used in writing and printing Malay. This is also the case in\r\n  the Straits Settlements.\r\n\r\n  By the simplicity of its phonetic elements, the regularity of its\r\n  grammatical structure, and the copiousness of its nautical vocabulary,\r\n  the Malay language is singularly well fitted to be the _lingua franca_\r\n  throughout the Indian archipelago. It possesses the five vowels _a_,\r\n  _i_, _u_, _e_, _o_, both short and long, and one pure diphthong, _au_.\r\n  Its consonants are _k_, _g_, _ng_, _ch_, _j_, _ñ_, _t_, _d_, _n_, _p_,\r\n  _b_, _m_, _y_, _r_, _l_, _w_, _s_, _h_. Long vowels can only occur in\r\n  open syllables. The only possible consonantal nexus in purely Malay\r\n  words is that of a nasal and mute, a liquid and mute and vice versa,\r\n  and a liquid and nasal. Final _k_ and _h_ are all but suppressed in\r\n  the utterance. Purely Arabic letters are only used in Arabic words, a\r\n  great number of which have been received into the Malay vocabulary.\r\n  But the Arabic character is even less suited to Malay than to the\r\n  other Eastern languages on which it has been foisted. As the short\r\n  vowels are not marked, one would, in seeing, e.g. the word _bntng_,\r\n  think first of _bintang_, a star; but the word might also mean a large\r\n  scar, to throw down, to spread, rigid, mutilated, enceinte, a kind of\r\n  cucumber, a redoubt, according as it is pronounced, _bantang_,\r\n  _banting_, _bentang_, _buntang_, _buntung_, _bunting_, _bonteng_,\r\n  _benteng_.\r\n\r\n  Malay is essentially, with few exceptions, a dissyllabic language, and\r\n  the syllabic accent rests on the penultimate unless that syllable is\r\n  open and short; e.g. datang, namaña, besár, diumpatkanñalah. Nothing\r\n  in the form of a root word indicates the grammatical category to which\r\n  it belongs; thus, _kasih_, kindness, affectionate, to love; _ganti_, a\r\n  proxy, to exchange, instead of. It is only in derivative words that\r\n  this vagueness is avoided. Derivation is effected by infixes,\r\n  prefixes, affixes and reduplication. Infixes occur more rarely in\r\n  Malay than in the cognate tongues. Examples are--_guruh_, a rumbling\r\n  noise, _gumuruh_, to make such a noise; _tunjuk_, to point,\r\n  _telunjuk_, the forefinger; _chuchuk_, to pierce, _cheruchuk_, a\r\n  stockade. The import of the prefixes--me (meng, meñ, men, mem), pe\r\n  (peng, peñ, pen, pem ber (bel), per, pel, ka, di, ter,--and\r\n  affixes--an, kan, i, lah--will best appear from the following\r\n  examples--root word _ajar_, to teach, to learn; _mengajar_, to\r\n  instruct (expresses an action); _bleajar_, to study (state or\r\n  condition); _mengajari_, to instruct (some one, trans.);\r\n  _mengajarkan_, to instruct (in something, causative); _pengajar_, the\r\n  instructor; _pelajar_, the learner; _pengajaran_, the lesson taught,\r\n  also the school; _pelajaran_, the lesson learnt; _diajar_, to be\r\n  learnt; _terajar_, learnt; _terajarkan_, taught; _terajari_,\r\n  instructed; _[peraja_ (from _raja_, prince), to recognize as prince;\r\n  _perajakan_, to crown as prince; karajaan, royalty]; _ajarkanlah_,\r\n  teach! Examples of reduplication are--_ajar-ajar_, a sainted person;\r\n  _ajar-berajar_ (or _belajar_), to be learning and teaching by turns;\r\n  similarly there are forms like _ajar-mengajar_, _berajar-ajaran_,\r\n  _ajar-ajari_, _memperajar_, _memperajarkan_, _memperajari_,\r\n  _terbelajarkan_, _perbelajarkan_, &c. Altogether there are upwards of\r\n  a hundred possible derivative forms, in the idiomatic use of which the\r\n  Malays exhibit much skill. See especially H. von Dewall, _De\r\n  vormveranderingen der Maleische taal_ (Batavia, 1864) and I.\r\n  Pijnappel, _Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek_ (Amsterdam, 1875),\r\n  \"Inleiding.\" In every other respect the language is characterized by\r\n  great simplicity and indefiniteness. There is no inflexion to\r\n  distinguish number, gender or case. Number is never indicated when the\r\n  sense is obvious or can be gathered from the context; otherwise\r\n  plurality is expressed by adjectives such as _sagala_, all, and\r\n  _bañak_, many; more rarely by the repetition of the noun, and the\r\n  indefinite singular by _sa_ or _satu_, one, with a class-word. Gender\r\n  may, if necessary, be distinguished by the words _laki-laki_, male,\r\n  and _perampuan_, female, in the case of persons, and of _jantan_ and\r\n  _betina_ in the case of animals. The genitive case is generally\r\n  indicated by the position of the word after its governing noun. Also\r\n  adjectives and demonstrative pronouns have their places after the\r\n  noun. Comparison is effected by the use of particles. Instead of the\r\n  personal pronouns, both in their full and abbreviated forms,\r\n  conventional nouns are in frequent use to indicate the social position\r\n  or relation of the respective interlocutors, as, e.g. _hamba tuan_,\r\n  the master's slave, i.e. I. These nouns vary according to the\r\n  different localities. Another peculiarity of Malay (and likewise of\r\n  Chinese, Shan, Talaing, Burmese and Siamese) is the use of certain\r\n  class-words or coefficients with numerals, such as _orang_ (man), when\r\n  speaking of persons, _ekor_ (tail) of animals, _keping_ (piece) of\r\n  flat things, _biji_ (seed) of roundish things; e.g. _lima biji,\r\n  telor_, five eggs. The number of these class-words is considerable.\r\n  Malay verbs have neither person or number nor mood or tense. The last\r\n  two are sometimes indicated by particles or auxiliary verbs; but these\r\n  are generally dispensed with if the meaning is sufficiently plain\r\n  without them. The Malays avoid the building up of long sentences. The\r\n  two main rules by which the order of the words in a sentence is\r\n  regulated are--subject, verb, object; and qualifying words follow\r\n  those which they qualify. This is quite the reverse of what is the\r\n  rule in Burmese.\r\n\r\n  The history of the Malays amply accounts for the number and variety of\r\n  foreign ingredients in their language. Hindus appear to have settled\r\n  in Sumatra and Java as early as the 4th century of our era, and to\r\n  have continued to exercise sway over the native populations for many\r\n  centuries. These received from them into their language a very large\r\n  number of Sanskrit terms, from which we can infer the nature of the\r\n  civilizing influence imparted by the Hindu rulers. Not only in words\r\n  concerning commerce and agriculture, but also in terms connected with\r\n  social, religious and administrative matters that influence is\r\n  traceable in Malay. See W. E. Maxwell, _Manual of the Malay Language_\r\n  (1882), pp. 5-34, where this subject is treated more fully than by\r\n  previous writers. This Sanskrit element forms such an integral part of\r\n  the Malay vocabulary that in spite of the subsequent infusion of\r\n  Arabic and Persian words adopted in the usual course of Mahommedan\r\n  conquest it has retained its ancient citizenship in the language. The\r\n  number of Portuguese, English, Dutch and Chinese words in Malay is not\r\n  considerable; their presence is easily accounted for by political or\r\n  commercial contact.\r\n\r\n  The Malay language abounds in idiomatic expressions, which constitute\r\n  the chief difficulty in its acquisition. It is sparing in the use of\r\n  personal pronouns, and prefers impersonal and elliptical diction. As\r\n  it is rich in specific expressions for the various aspects of certain\r\n  ideas, it is requisite to employ always the most appropriate term\r\n  suited to the particular aspect. In Maxwell's _Manual_, pp. 120 seq.,\r\n  no less than sixteen terms are given to express the different kinds of\r\n  striking, as many for the different kinds of speaking, eighteen for\r\n  the various modes of carrying, &c. An unnecessary distinction has been\r\n  made between _High Malay_ and _Low Malay_. The latter is no separate\r\n  dialect at all, but a mere brogue or jargon, the medium of intercourse\r\n  between illiterate natives and Europeans too indolent to apply\r\n  themselves to the acquisition of the language of the people; its\r\n  vocabulary is made up of Malay words, with a conventional admixture of\r\n  words from other languages; and it varies, not only in different\r\n  localities, but also in proportion to the individual speaker's\r\n  acquaintance with Malay proper. A few words are used, however, only in\r\n  speaking with persons of royal rank--e.g. _santap_, to eat (of a raja)\r\n  instead of _makan_; _beradu_, to sleep, instead of ti_dor_; _gring_,\r\n  unwell, instead of _sakit_; _mangkat_, to die, instead of _mati_, &c.\r\n  The use is different as regards the term _Jawi_ as applied to the\r\n  Malay language. This has its origin in the names Great Java and Lesser\r\n  Java, by which the medieval Java and Sumatra were called, and it\r\n  accordingly means the language spoken along the coasts of the two\r\n  great islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Literature.\r\n\r\n  The Malays cannot, strictly speaking, be said to possess a literature,\r\n  for none of their writings can boast any literary beauty or value.\r\n  Their most characteristic literature is to be found, not in their\r\n  writings, but in the folk-tales which are transmitted orally from\r\n  generation to generation, and repeated by the wandering minstrels\r\n  called by the people _Peng-lipor Lara_, i.e. \"Soothers of Care.\" Some\r\n  specimens of these are to be found in the _Journal of the Straits\r\n  Branch of the Asiatic Society_ (Singapore). The collections of _Malay\r\n  Proberbs_ made by Klinkert, Maxwell and Clifford also give a good idea\r\n  of the literary methods of the Malays. Their verse is of a very\r\n  primitive description, and is chiefly used for purposes of\r\n  love-making. There are numerous rhymed fairy tales, which are much\r\n  liked by the people, but they are of no literary merit. The best Malay\r\n  books are the _Hikayat Hang Tuak_, _Bestamam_ and the _Hikayat\r\n  Abdullah_. The latter is a diary of events kept during Sir Stamford\r\n  Raffle's administration by his Malay scribe.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Hugh Clifford, _In Court and Kampong_ (London, 1897);\r\n  _Studies in Brown Humanity_ (London, 1898); _In a Corner of Asia_\r\n  (London, 1899); _Bush-whacking_ (London 1901); Clifford and\r\n  Swettenham, _Dictionary of the Malay Language_, parts i. to v.

The native states of the Malay Peninsula under\r\nBritish protection are divided into two groups: (1) federated, and (2)\r\nnon-federated.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--FEDERATED STATES\r\n\r\nThe federated states, under the protection of Great Britain, but not\r\nBritish possessions, are Perak, Selangor and the confederation of small\r\nstates known as the Negri Sembilan (i.e. Nine States) on the west\r\ncoast, and the state of Pahang on the east coast. Each state is under\r\nthe rule of a sultan, who is assisted in his legislative duties by a\r\nstate council, upon which the resident, and in some cases the secretary\r\nto the resident, has a seat, and which is composed of native chiefs and\r\none or more Chinese members nominated by the sultan with the advice and\r\nconsent of the resident. The council, in addition to legislative and\r\nother duties, revises all sentences of capital punishment. The\r\nadministrative work of each state is carried on by the resident and his\r\nstaff of European officials, whose ranks are recruited by successful\r\ncandidates in the competitive examinations held annually by the Civil\r\nService commissioners. The sultan of each state is bound by treaty with\r\nthe British government to accept the advice of the resident, who is thus\r\npractically paramount; but great deference is paid to the opinions and\r\nwishes of the sultans and their chiefs, and the British officials are\r\npledged not to interfere with the religious affairs of the Mahommedan\r\ncommunity. In the actual administration of the Malay population great\r\nuse is made of the native aristocratic system, the peasants being\r\ngoverned largely by their own chiefs, headmen and village elders, under\r\nthe close supervision of British district officers. The result is a\r\nbenevolent autocracy admirably adapted to local conditions and to the\r\ncharacter and traditions of the people. A recognition of the fact that\r\nthe welfare of the Malays, who are the people of the land and whose\r\nsultans have never ceded their territories to the British, must be\r\nregarded as the first consideration has been the guiding principle of\r\nthe administration of the Malay States, and this has resulted in an\r\nextraordinary amelioration of the condition of the natives, which has\r\nproceeded concurrently with a notable development of the country and its\r\nresources, mineral and agricultural. To the work of development,\r\nhowever, the Malays have themselves contributed little, sound\r\nadministration having been secured by the British officials, enterprise\r\nand capital having been supplied mainly by the Chinese, and the labour\r\nemployed being almost entirely Chinese or Tamil. Meanwhile the Malays\r\nhave improved their ancestral holdings, have enjoyed a peace and a\r\nsecurity to which their past history furnishes no parallel, have\r\nobtained easy access to new and important markets for their agricultural\r\nproduce, and for the rest have been suffered to lead the lives best\r\nsuited to their characters and their desires. Each principal department\r\nof the administration has its federal head, and all the residents\r\ncorrespond with and are controlled by the resident-general, who, in his\r\nturn, is responsible to the high commissioner, the governor of the\r\nStraits Settlements for the time being.\r\n\r\n  The estimated aggregate area of the Federated Malay States is 28,000\r\n  sq. m., and the estimated population in 1905 was 860,000, as against\r\n  678,595 in 1901. Of these only about 230,000 are Malays. The revenue\r\n  of the federation in 1905 was $23,964,593 (about £2,795,000), and the\r\n  expenditure was $20,750,395 (about £2,460,000). The imports for the\r\n  same year were valued at $50,575,455 (about £5,900,000), and the\r\n  exports at $80,057,654 (about £9,340,000), making a total trade of\r\n  nearly 15¼ millions sterling. The principal sources of revenue are an\r\n  export duty on tin, the rents paid for the revenue farms of the right\r\n  to collect import duties on opium, wine and spirits, and to keep\r\n  licensed gambling-houses for the exclusive use of the Chinese\r\n  population, railway receipts, land and forest revenue and postal\r\n  revenue. The tin is won from large alluvial deposits found in the\r\n  states of the western seaboard, and the mines are worked almost\r\n  exclusively by Chinese capital and labour. Since 1889 the Federated\r\n  Malay States have produced considerably more than half the tin of the\r\n  world. Recently there has been a great development in agricultural\r\n  enterprise, especially with regard to rubber, which is now grown in\r\n  large quantities, the estates being mainly in the hands of Europeans,\r\n  and the labour mostly Tamil. The states are opened up by over 2500 m.\r\n  of some of the best metalled cart-roads in the world, and by a railway\r\n  system, 350 m. of which, extending from the mainland opposite Penang\r\n  to the ancient town of Malacca, are open to traffic. Another 150 m. of\r\n  railway is under construction. The government offices at Kuala Lumpor,\r\n  the federal capital of the states, are among the finest buildings of\r\n  the kind in Asia. The whole of this extraordinary development, it\r\n  should be noted, has been effected by careful, sound and wise\r\n  administration coupled with a courageous and energetic policy of\r\n  expenditure upon public works. Throughout, not one penny of debt has\r\n  been incurred, the roads, railways, &c., being constructed entirely\r\n  from current balances. This of course has only been rendered possible\r\n  by the extraordinary mineral wealth which the states on the western\r\n  seaboard have developed in the hands of Chinese miners amid the peace\r\n  and security which British rule has brought to these once lawless\r\n  lands. The value of the tin output for the year 1905 amounted to\r\n  $69,460,993 (£8,104,199). Although agricultural enterprise in the\r\n  Malay States is assuming considerable proportions and a growing\r\n  importance, the total value of the principal agricultural products,\r\n  including timber, for the year 1905 only aggregated $2,435,513\r\n  (£289,143).\r\n\r\n  The whole of the Malay Peninsula is one vast forest, through which\r\n  flow countless streams that form one of the most lavish water-systems\r\n  in the world. The rivers, though many of them are of imposing\r\n  appearance and of considerable length, are uniformly shallow, only a\r\n  few on the west coast being navigable by ships for a distance of some\r\n  40 m. from their mouths. In spite of the notable development above\r\n  referred to, only a very small fraction of the entire area of the\r\n  states has as yet been touched either by mining or agricultural\r\n  enterprise. It is not too much to assert that the larger half of the\r\n  forest-lands has never been trodden by the foot of man. (For\r\n  information concerning the botany, geology, &c., of the Malay States\r\n  see MALAY PENINSULA. For the ethnology see MALAYS.)\r\n\r\nPERAK is situated between the parallels 3° 37´ and 6° 5´ N. and 100° 3´\r\nto 101° 51´ E. on the western side of the Malay Peninsula. It is bounded\r\non the N. by the British possession of Province Wellesley and the Malay\r\nstate of Kedah; on the S. by the protected native state of Selangor; on\r\nthe E. by the protected native state of Pahang and the independent\r\nstates of Kelantan and Petani; and on the W. by the Straits of Malacca.\r\nThe coast-line is about 90 m. in length. The extreme distance from the\r\nmost northerly to the most southerly portions of the state is about 172\r\nm., and the greatest breadth from east to west is about 100 m. The total\r\narea of the country is estimated at about 10,000 sq. m.\r\n\r\n  The Perak river, which runs in a southerly direction almost parallel\r\n  with the coast for nearly 150 m. of its course, is navigable for small\r\n  steamers for about 40 m. from its mouth, and by native trading boats\r\n  for nearly 200 m. The Plus, Batang, Padang and Kinta rivers are its\r\n  principal tributaries, all of them falling into the Perak on its left\r\n  bank. The other principal rivers of the state are the Krian, Kurau,\r\n  Larut and Bruas to the north of the mouth of the Perak, and the Bernam\r\n  to the south. None of these rivers is of any great importance as a\r\n  waterway, although the Bernam River is navigable for small steamers\r\n  for nearly 100 m. of its course. The mountain ranges, which cover a\r\n  considerable area, run from the north-east to the south-west. The\r\n  highest altitudes attained by them do not exceed 7500 ft., but they\r\n  average about 2500 ft. They are all thickly covered with jungle. The\r\n  ranges are two, running parallel to one another, with the valley of\r\n  the Perak between them. The larger is a portion of the main chain,\r\n  which runs down the peninsula from north to south. The lesser is\r\n  situated in the district of Larut. There are several hill sanatoria in\r\n  the state at heights which vary from 2500 to 4700 ft. above sea-level,\r\n  but the extreme humidity of the atmosphere renders the coolness thus\r\n  obtainable the reverse of enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Geology.\r\n\r\n  Mr Leonard Wray, curator of the Perak museum, writes as follows on the\r\n  subject of the geological formation of the state: \"There are really\r\n  only four formations represented--firstly, the granitic rocks;\r\n  secondly, a large series of beds of gneiss, quartzite, schist and\r\n  sandstone, overlaid in many places by thick beds of crystalline\r\n  limestone; thirdly, small sheets of trap rock; and fourthly,\r\n  river-gravels and other Quaternary deposits. The granites are of many\r\n  varieties, and also, in all probability, of several different\r\n  geological periods. The series of quartzites, schists, and limestone\r\n  are of great age, but as no fossils have ever been found in any of\r\n  them, nothing definite can be stated as to their exact chronological\r\n  position. Their lithological characteristics and the total absence of\r\n  all organic remains point to the Archaean period. The failure to\r\n  discover signs of life in them is, of course, merely negative\r\n  evidence, and the finding of a single fossil would at once upset it.\r\n  However, until this happens they may be conveniently classed as\r\n  Laurentian. It is at present impossible to form anything approaching\r\n  an accurate estimate of the thickness of this extensive series, but it\r\n  is probable that it is somewhere between 4000 and 5000 ft.\r\n  Unconformability has been noticed between the limestones and the beds\r\n  beneath, but whether this is sufficient to separate them or not is a\r\n  matter for future investigation.... The taller hills are exclusively\r\n  composed of granite, as also are some of the lower ones.... The ores\r\n  of the following metals have been found in the formations named:\r\n  Granite--tin, lead, iron, arsenic, tungsten and titanium;\r\n  Laurentian--tin, gold, lead, silver, iron, arsenic, copper, zinc,\r\n  tungsten, manganese and bismuth; Quaternary--tin, gold, copper,\r\n  tungsten, iron and titanium. This is not to be considered a complete\r\n  list, as small quantities of other metals have also been found.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n  The early history of Perak is obscure, the only information on the\r\n  subject being obtained from native traditions, which are altogether\r\n  untrustworthy. According to these authorities, however, a settlement\r\n  was first made by Malays in Perak at Bruas, and the capital was later\r\n  moved to the banks of the Perak River, the site chosen being a little\r\n  village called Temong, which lies some miles up stream from Kuala\r\n  Kangsar, the present residence of the sultan. When the Malacca\r\n  sultanate fell, owing to the invasion of the Portuguese in 1511, a\r\n  member of that royal house is said to have migrated to Perak, and the\r\n  present dynasty claims to have been descended from him. As this boast\r\n  is also made by almost every ruling family in the peninsula, the\r\n  tradition is not worthy of any special attention. What is more certain\r\n  is the tradition that Perak was twice invaded by the Achinese, and its\r\n  rulers carried off into captivity, one of them, Sultan Mansur Shah,\r\n  subsequently becoming the ruler of Achin. The first European\r\n  settlement in Perak was made by the Dutch in 1650, under a treaty\r\n  entered into with the Achinese, but the natives of the country rose\r\n  against the Dutch again and again, and it was abandoned in 1783,\r\n  though it was afterwards reoccupied, the Dutch being finally ejected\r\n  by the British in 1795. In 1818 the Siamese conquered Perak, but its\r\n  independence was secured by a treaty between the British and Siamese\r\n  governments in 1824. From that date until 1874 Perak was ruled by its\r\n  own sultans, but in that year, owing to internal strife, Sultan\r\n  Abdullah applied to the then governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir\r\n  Andrew Clarke, for the assistance of a British Resident. The treaty of\r\n  Pangkor was concluded on the 20th of January 1874, and the first\r\n  resident, Mr J. W. W. Birch, was murdered on the 2nd of November 1875.\r\n  A punitive expedition became necessary; sultan Abdullah and the other\r\n  chiefs concerned in the murder were banished, the actual murderers\r\n  were hanged, and Raja Muda Jusuf was declared regent. He died in 1888,\r\n  and was succeeded by the sultan Raja Idris, K.C.M.G., a most\r\n  enlightened ruler, who was from the first a strong and intelligent\r\n  advocate of British methods of administration. Sir Hugh Low was\r\n  appointed resident, a position which he held until 1889, when he was\r\n  succeeded by Sir Frank Swettenham. Since then the history of Perak has\r\n  been one of continuous peace and growing prosperity and wealth.\r\n  Although the federal capital is Kuala Lumpor in Selangor, Perak still\r\n  enjoys the honour of being the senior and leading state of the\r\n  federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Population.\r\n\r\n  By the census taken on the 5th of April 1891 the population of Perak\r\n  was shown to be as follows: Europeans, 366; Eurasians, Jews and\r\n  Armenians, 293; Malays, 96,719; Chinese, 94,345; Tamils, 13,086;\r\n  aborigines, 5779; other nationalities, 3666; thus making a grand total\r\n  of 214,254, of whom 156,408 were males and 57,846 were females. The\r\n  estimated population in 1905 was 400,000, of whom 200,000 were Chinese\r\n  and 160,000 were Malays, but owing to the disparity of the proportions\r\n  between the sexes the deaths in each year largely outnumber the\r\n  births, and the increase in the population is accounted for solely by\r\n  the number of immigrants, chiefly from the mainland of China, and to a\r\n  lesser extent from India also.\r\n\r\n  The revenue of Perak in 1874 amounted to $226,333. That for 1905\r\n  amounted to $12,242,897. Of this latter sum $4,876,400 was derived\r\n  from duty on exported tin, $2,489,300 from railway receipts, $505,300\r\n  from land revenue and $142,800 from postal and telegraphic revenue.\r\n  The remainder is mainly derived from the revenue farms, which are\r\n  leased to Chinese capitalists for a short term of years, conveying to\r\n  the lessee the right to collect import duties upon opium, wine and\r\n  spirits, to keep pawnbroking shops, and to keep public licensed\r\n  gambling-houses for the use of Chinese only. The expenditure for 1905\r\n  amounted to $10,141,980. Of this sum $4,236,000 was expended upon\r\n  railway upkeep and construction and $2,176,100 upon public works. The\r\n  value of the imports into Perak during 1905 was over $20,000,000, and\r\n  that of the exports exceeded $40,000,000, making a total of over\r\n  $60,000,000, equivalent to about seven million sterling. The output of\r\n  tin from Perak ranged between 18,960 tons, valued at $23,099,506 in\r\n  1899, and 26,600 tons, valued at $35,500,000, in 1905. The fluctuating\r\n  character of the output is due, not to any exhaustion of the mineral\r\n  deposits of the state--that is not to be anticipated for many years\r\n  yet to come--but to the uncertainty of the labour supply. The mining\r\n  population is recruited exclusively from the districts of southern\r\n  China, and during certain years an increased demand for labourers in\r\n  China itself, in French Indo-China, in the Dutch colonies, and in\r\n  South Africa temporarily and adversely affected immigration to the\r\n  Straits of Malacca. The output has, moreover, been affected from time\r\n  to time by the price of tin, which was $32.20 per pikul in 1896, rose\r\n  to $42.96 in 1898, to $74.15 in 1900, and averaged $80.60 in 1905.\r\n  Exclusive of tin, the principal exports were $108,000 worth of Para\r\n  rubber, $181,000 of copra, $54,000 of hides, $48,000 of patchouli, and\r\n  considerable quantities of timber, rattans and other jungle produce.\r\n  The agricultural development of the state is still in its infancy, but\r\n  rubber is cultivated in rapidly increasing areas, and the known\r\n  fertility of the soil, the steady and regular rainfall, the excellent\r\n  means of communication, and the natural and artificial conditions of\r\n  the country, justify the expectation that the future of Perak as an\r\n  agricultural country will be prosperous.\r\n\r\n\r\n    General.\r\n\r\n  Although so much has been done to develop the resources of Perak, by\r\n  far the greater portion of the state is still covered by dense and\r\n  virgin forest. In 1898 it was calculated that only 330,249 acres of\r\n  land were occupied or cultivated out of a total acreage of 6,400,000.\r\n  The area of agricultural holdings has notably increased, but a\r\n  considerable period must yet elapse before it will amount to even\r\n  one-tenth of the whole. A line of railway connects the port of Teluk\r\n  Anson with the great mining district of Kinta, whence the line runs,\r\n  crossing the Perak River at Enggor, to Kuala Kangsar, the residence of\r\n  the sultan, thence to Taiping, the administrative capital of the\r\n  state, and via Krian to a point opposite to the island of Penang. A\r\n  second line runs south from Perak and connects with the railway system\r\n  of Selangor, which in its turn connects with the Negri Sembilan and\r\n  Malacca line, thus giving through railway communication between the\r\n  last-named town and Penang. Perak also possesses some 600 miles of\r\n  excellent metalled cart-road, and the length of completed road is\r\n  annually increasing.\r\n\r\n  For administrative purposes the state is divided into six districts:\r\n  Upper Perak, Kuala Kangsar and Lower Perak, on the Perak River; Kinta;\r\n  Batany Padang and Larut and Krian. Of these, Larut and Kinta are the\r\n  principal mining centres, while Krian is the most prosperous\r\n  agricultural district. The districts on the Perak River are mostly\r\n  peopled by Malays. The administrative capital is Taiping, the chief\r\n  town of Larut. Kuala Kangsar is chiefly memorable as having been the\r\n  scene of the first federal meeting of native chiefs, who, with the\r\n  British Residents from each state, met together in 1897 for friendly\r\n  discussion of their common interests for the first time in history,\r\n  under the auspices of the high commissioner, Sir Charles H. B.\r\n  Mitchell. This, in the eyes of those who are acquainted with the\r\n  character of the Malays and of the relations which formerly subsisted\r\n  between the rulers of the various states, is perhaps the most signal\r\n  token of the changes which British influence has wrought in the\r\n  peninsula.\r\n\r\nSELANGOR is situated between the parallels 2° 32´ and 3° 37´ N. and 100°\r\n38´ and 102° E., on the western side of the Malay Peninsula. It is\r\nbounded on the N. by the protected native state of Perak, on the S. by\r\nthe protected states of the Negri Sembilan, on the E. by Pahang and the\r\nNegri Sembilan, and on the W. by the Straits of Malacca. The coast-line\r\nis about 100 m. in length, greatest length about 104 m., and greatest\r\nbreadth about 48 m., total area estimated at about 3000 sq. m.\r\n\r\n  The state consists of a narrow strip of land between the mountain\r\n  range which forms the backbone of the peninsula and the Straits of\r\n  Malacca. Compared with other states in the peninsula, Selangor is\r\n  poorly watered. The principal rivers are the Selangor, the Klang and\r\n  the Langat. The principal port of the state is Port Swettenham,\r\n  situated at the mouth of the Klang River, and is connected with the\r\n  capital, Kuala Lumpor, by a railway. The geology of the state closely\r\n  resembles that of Perak. The state is possessed of most valuable\r\n  deposits of alluvial tin, and mining for this metal is the chief\r\n  industry of the population. Kuala Lumpor is also the federal capital\r\n  of the Malay States.\r\n\r\n\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n  According to native tradition, the ruling house of Selangor is\r\n  descended from a Bugis raja, who, with two of his brothers, settled in\r\n  the state in 1718, the son of the youngest brother eventually becoming\r\n  ruler of the country. In 1783 the then sultan of Selangor joined with\r\n  the Iang-di-per-Tuan Muda of Riau in an unsuccessful attack upon the\r\n  Dutch who then held Malacca. In retaliation the Dutch, under Admiral\r\n  Van Braam, invaded Selangor and drove the sultan out of his country.\r\n  In 1785, aided by the Bendahara of Pahang, Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor\r\n  reconquered his state; but the Dutch blockaded his ports, and\r\n  eventually forced him to enter into a treaty whereby he consented to\r\n  acknowledge their sovereignty. The earliest British political\r\n  communication with Selangor began in 1818, when a commercial treaty\r\n  was concluded with the governor of Penang. In 1867 Sultan Abdul Samad\r\n  of Selangor appointed his son-in-law, Tungku Dia Udin, to be viceroy;\r\n  and this gave rise to a civil war which lasted almost without\r\n  intermission till 1873, when the enemies of Tungku Dia Udin were\r\n  finally vanquished, largely by the agency of the Bendahara of Pahang,\r\n  who, at the invitation of the governor of the Straits Settlements,\r\n  sent a warlike expedition to the assistance of the viceroy. In 1874\r\n  the occurrence of an atrocious act of piracy off the mouth of the\r\n  Langat River led to the governor, Sir Andrew Clarke, appointing, at\r\n  the request of the sultan, a British Resident to aid him in the\r\n  administration of his kingdom. Since that date there has been no\r\n  further breach of the peace, and the prosperity of Selangor has\r\n  increased annually.\r\n\r\n  By the census taken on the 5th of April 1891 the population of\r\n  Selangor was given at 81,592 souls, of whom 67,051 were males and only\r\n  14,541 were females. The census taken on the 5th of April 1901 gave a\r\n  total population of 168,789 souls, of whom 136,823 were males and\r\n  31,966 females. Of these 108,768 were Chinese, 33,997 were Malays,\r\n  16,748 were Tamils, and only 487 were Europeans. The returns deal with\r\n  nearly a score of different nationalities. Since 1901 the population\r\n  has been much increased and now certainly exceeds 200,000 souls. Now,\r\n  however, that instead of a single port of entry there exist easy means\r\n  of access to the state by rail both from the north and the south, it\r\n  is no longer possible to estimate the annual increase by immigration\r\n  with any approach to accuracy. It will be noted that the inhabitants\r\n  of this erstwhile Malayan state were, even at the time of the census\r\n  of 1901, over 64% Chinese, while the Malays were little more than 20%\r\n  of the population. In Selangor, as elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula,\r\n  the deaths annually far outnumber the births recorded (e.g. in 1905\r\n  births 8293, deaths 12,500). The disproportion of the female to the\r\n  male sections of the population is greater in Selangor than in any\r\n  other part of the colony or Malay States. The development of planting\r\n  enterprise in Selangor, and more especially the cultivation of rubber,\r\n  has led during recent years to the immigration of a considerable\r\n  number of Tamil coolies, but the Tamil population is still\r\n  insignificant as compared with the Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finance, Trade, &c.\r\n\r\n  The revenue of Selangor in 1875 amounted to only $115,656; in 1905 it\r\n  had increased to $8,857,793. Of this latter sum $3,195,318 was derived\r\n  from duty on tin exported, $1,972,628 from federal receipts, and\r\n  $340,360 from land revenue. The balance is chiefly derived from the\r\n  revenue farms, which include the right to collect import duty on opium\r\n  and spirits. The expenditure for 1905 amounted to $7,186,146, of which\r\n  sum $3,717,238 was on account of federal charges and $1,850,711 for\r\n  public works. The value of the imports in 1905 was $24,643,619 and\r\n  that of the exports was $26,683,316, making a total of $51,326,935,\r\n  equivalent to £5,988,000. Tin is the principal export. The amount\r\n  exported in 1905 was 17,254 tons. The total area of alienated mining\r\n  land at the end of 1905 amounted to 65,573 acres, and it was estimated\r\n  that over 60,000 Chinese were employed in the mines.\r\n\r\n  The main trunk line of the Federated Malay States railways passes\r\n  through Selangor. It enters the state at Tanjong Malim on the Perak\r\n  boundary, runs southward through Kuala Lumpor and so into the Negri\r\n  Sembilan. It runs for 81 m. in Selangor territory. A branch line 27 m.\r\n  long connects Kuala Lumpor with Port Swettenham on the Klang Straits\r\n  where extensive wharves, capable of accommodating ocean-going vessels,\r\n  have been constructed. A second branch line, measuring rather more\r\n  than 4 m. in length, has been opened to traffic. It connects the caves\r\n  at Batu with Kuala Lumpor. Frequent communication is maintained by\r\n  steamer between Port Swettenham and Singapore, and by coasting vessels\r\n  between the former port and those on the shores of the Straits of\r\n  Malacca. All the principal places in the state are connected with one\r\n  another by telegraph.\r\n\r\n  For administrative purposes Selangor is divided into six districts:\r\n  Kuala Lumpor, in which the capital and the principal tin-fields are\r\n  situated; Ulu Selangor, which is also a prosperous mining district;\r\n  Kuala Selangor, which is agricultural, and poorly populated by Malays;\r\n  Ulu Langat, mining and agricultural; Kuala Langat, the residence of\r\n  the late sultan Abdul Samad, agricultural; and Klang, the only\r\n  prosperous port of the state. Much money has been expended upon the\r\n  capital, Kuala Lumpor, which possesses some fine public buildings,\r\n  waterworks, &c., and where the principal residence of the\r\n  Resident-General is situated. In some sort Kuala Lumpor is the capital\r\n  not only of Selangor, but also of the whole federation. Its scenery is\r\n  very attractive.\r\n\r\nNEGRI SEMBILAN (the Nine States) is a federation of small native states\r\nwhich is now treated as a single entity, being under the control of a\r\nBritish Resident, and is situated between parallels 2° 28´ and 3° 18´ N.\r\nand 101° 45´ and 102° 45´ E., on the western side of the Malay\r\nPeninsula. It is bounded on the N. by the protected state of Pahang, on\r\nthe S. by the territory of Malacca, on the E. by Pahang and the\r\nindependent state of Johor, and on the W. by the Straits of Malacca. The\r\ncoast-line is about 28 m. in length, and the extreme distance from north\r\nto south is 55 m., and that from east to west about 65 m. The estimated\r\narea is about 3000 sq. m. Port Dickson, or Arang-Arang, is the only port\r\non the coast. It is connected with the capital, Seremban, by a railway\r\n24 m. in length. Most of the states comprising the federation depend\r\nlargely for their prosperity upon agriculture, but in some of the\r\ndistricts tin is being worked in considerable quantities, with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n  As is the case with the history of most Malayan states, much rests\r\n  upon no surer ground than tradition, in so far as the records of the\r\n  Negri Sembilan are concerned. At the same time the native story that\r\n  the states which now form the federation of the Negri Sembilan were\r\n  originally peopled by tribes of Sakai, or aborigines of the peninsula,\r\n  who descended from the mountains of the interior and peopled the\r\n  valleys, is supported by much corroborative evidence. Not only does\r\n  the Malay's contempt for the Sakai make it exceedingly unlikely that\r\n  the tradition, which is hardly a matter for pride, should have been\r\n  preserved if it were not true, but also many of the laws and customs\r\n  in force in these states are wholly foreign to those of the Malays,\r\n  and can plainly be traced to the aborigines. As an instance, the\r\n  custom of inheriting rank and property through the mother instead of\r\n  through the father may be mentioned. Tradition further relates that\r\n  towards the end of the 18th century a raja of the royal house of\r\n  Menangkabu came from Sumatra to rule over the federation of small\r\n  states, each of which continued to be governed in all its local\r\n  affairs by its own chief and by the village and other councils\r\n  sanctioned by ancient custom. The Sumatran raja took the title of\r\n  Iang-di-per-Tuan of Sri Menanti. Although they bore the name of the\r\n  \"Nine States,\" only six seem to have belonged to the federation during\r\n  the time of which history speaks. These are Sri Menanti, Johol,\r\n  Tampin, Rembau, Jelebu, and Sungei Ujong. Later the two latter\r\n  separated themselves from the confederation. Ancient tradition says\r\n  that the names of the nine states were originally Klang, Jelebu,\r\n  Sungei Ujong, Johol, Segamat, Pasir Besar, Naning, Rembau and Jelai.\r\n  Of these Klang was annexed by Selangor, Segamat and Pasir Besar by\r\n  Johor, and Naning by Malacca. During the last years of the 18th\r\n  century the Iang-di-per-Tuan appointed an Iang-di-per-Tuan Muda to\r\n  rule Rembau, and the state of Tampin was created to provide for the\r\n  family of the new chief. In 1887 the governor of the Straits\r\n  Settlements sent Mr Martin Lister to the Negri Sembilan, which had\r\n  become disintegrated, and by his influence the ancient federal system\r\n  was revived under the control of a Resident appointed by the governor.\r\n  The states which formed this new confederation were Johol, Ulu Muar,\r\n  Jempol, Terachi, Inas, Gunong Pasir, Rembau, Tampin and Gemencheh.\r\n  Prior to this, in 1873, owing to a civil war in Sungei Ujong, Sir\r\n  Andrew Clarke sent a military force to that state, put an end to the\r\n  disturbances, and placed the country under the control of a British\r\n  Resident. Jelebu was taken under British protection in 1886, and was\r\n  thenceforth managed by a magistrate under the orders of the Resident\r\n  of Sungei Ujong. In 1896, when the federation of all the Malayan\r\n  states under British control was effected, Sungei Ujong and Jelebu\r\n  were reunited to the confederation of small states from which they had\r\n  so long been separated and the whole, under the old name of the Negri\r\n  Sembilan, or Nine States, was placed under one Resident.\r\n\r\n  The population of the Negri Sembilan, which according to the census\r\n  taken in April 1891 was only 70,730, had increased to 96,028 by 1901,\r\n  and was estimated at 119,454 in 1905. Of these 46,500 are Chinese,\r\n  65,000 Malays, 6700 Tamils, and 900 Europeans and Eurasians. The\r\n  births registered slightly exceed the deaths in number, there being a\r\n  large Malay population in the Negri Sembilan among whom the proportion\r\n  of women to men is fair, a condition of things not found in localities\r\n  where the inhabitants are mostly Chinese immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finance and Trade.\r\n\r\n  The revenue of the Negri Sembilan amounted to only $223,435 in 1888.\r\n  In 1898 it had increased to $701,334, in 1900 to $1,251,366, and in\r\n  1905 to $2,335,534. The revenue for 1905 was derived mainly as\r\n  follows:--customs $1,268,602, land revenue $145,475, land sales\r\n  $21,407, while the revenue farms contributed $584,459. The expenditure\r\n  in 1905 amounted to $2,214,093, of which $1,125,355 was expended upon\r\n  public works. The trade returns for 1905, which are not, however,\r\n  complete, show an aggregate value of about $13,000,000. The value of\r\n  the tin exported during 1905 exceeded $6,900,000, and the value of the\r\n  agricultural produce, of which gambier represented $211,000 and damar\r\n  $80,000, amounted to $407,990.\r\n\r\n\r\n    General.\r\n\r\n  Seremban, the administrative capital of the Negri Sembilan, is\r\n  connected with Port Dickson by a railway line, owned by the Sungei\r\n  Ujong Railway Company, which is 24½ m. in length. It is also situated\r\n  on the trunk line of the Federated Malay States, and is thus joined by\r\n  rail to Selangor on the north and to Malacca on the south. Frequent\r\n  steam communication is maintained between Port Dickson and the ports\r\n  on the Straits of Malacca and with Singapore.\r\n\r\n  For administrative purposes the Negri Sembilan is divided into five\r\n  districts, viz. the Seremban District, the Coast District, Jelebu,\r\n  Kuala Pilah and Tampin. Each of these is under the charge of a\r\n  European district officer, who is responsible to the Resident. The\r\n  Iang-di-per-Tuan lives at Kuala Pilah, but the capital of the\r\n  federation is at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the Resident is\r\n  stationed. The hereditary chiefs of the various states aid in the\r\n  government of their districts, and have seats upon the state council,\r\n  over which the Iang-di-per-Tuan presides. The watering-place of\r\n  Magnolia Bay, where excellent sea-bathing is obtainable, is one of the\r\n  pleasure resorts of this part of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nPAHANG, on the east coast of the peninsula, is situated between\r\nparallels 2° 28´ and 3° 45´ N. and 101° 30´ and 103° 30´ E. It is\r\nbounded on the N. by the independent native states of Kelantan and\r\nTrengganu; on the S. by the Negri Sembilan and Johor; on the E. by the\r\nChina Sea; and on the W. by the protected states of Perak and Selangor.\r\nThe coast-line is about 112 m. in length; the greatest length is about\r\n210 m., and greatest breadth about 130 m. The state is the largest in\r\nthe peninsula, its area being estimated at 15,000 sq. m. The ports on\r\nthe coast are the mouths of the Endau, Rompin, Pahang and Kuantan\r\nrivers, but during the north-east monsoon the coast is not easy of\r\napproach, and the rivers, all of which are guarded by difficult bars,\r\nare impossible of access except at high tides.\r\n\r\n  The principal river of the state is the Pahang, from which it takes\r\n  its name. At a distance of 180 m. from the coast this river is formed\r\n  by two others named respectively the Jelai and the Tembeling. The\r\n  former is joined 20 m. farther up stream by the Lipis, which has its\r\n  rise in the mountains which form the boundary with Perak. The Jelai\r\n  itself has its rise also in a more northerly portion of this range,\r\n  while its two principal tributaries above the mouth of the Lipis, the\r\n  Telom and the Serau, rise, the one in the plateau which divides Perak\r\n  from Pahang, the other in the hills which separate Pahang from\r\n  Kelantan. The Tembeling has its rise in the hills which divide Pahang\r\n  from Kelantan, but some of its tributaries rise on the Trengganu\r\n  frontier, while the largest of its confluents comes from the hills in\r\n  which the Kuantan River takes its rise. The Pahang is navigable for\r\n  large boats as far as Kuala Lipis, 200 m. from the mouth, and\r\n  light-draught launches can also get up to that point. Smaller boats\r\n  can be taken some 80 m. higher up the Jelai and Telom. The river,\r\n  however, as a waterway is of little use, since it is uniformly\r\n  shallow. The Rompin and Kuantan rivers are somewhat more easily\r\n  navigated for the first 30 m. of their course, but taken as a whole\r\n  the waterways of Pahang are of little value. The interior of Pahang is\r\n  chiefly noted for its auriferous deposits. Gunong Tahan is situated on\r\n  the boundary between Pahang and Kelantan. Its height is estimated at\r\n  8000 ft. above sea-level, but it has never yet been ascended. Pahang,\r\n  like the states on the west coast, is covered almost entirely by one\r\n  vast forest, but in the Lipis valley, which formerly was thickly\r\n  populated, there is a considerable expanse of open grass plain unlike\r\n  anything to be seen on the western seaboard. The coast is for the most\r\n  part a sandy beach fringed with _casuarina_ trees and there are only a\r\n  few patches of mangrove-swamp throughout its entire length.\r\n\r\n\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n  The ancient name of Pahang was Indrapura. It is mentioned in the\r\n  history of _Hang Tuah_, the great Malacca brave, who flourished in the\r\n  16th century, and succeeded in abducting a daughter of the then ruling\r\n  house of Pahang for his master, the sultan of Malacca. Prior to this,\r\n  Pahang had been ruled by the Siamese. When Malacca fell into the hands\r\n  of the Portuguese in 1511 the sultan, Muhammad Shah, fled to Pahang,\r\n  and the present ruling house claims to have been descended from him.\r\n  The title of the ruler of Pahang was Bendahara until 1882, when the\r\n  present (1902) ruler, Wan Ahmad, assumed the title of sultan, taking\r\n  the name of Sultan Ahmad Maatham Shah. Up to that time the Bendahara\r\n  had been installed on his accession by the sultan of Riau, and held\r\n  his office by virtue of that chief's letter of authority. About 1855\r\n  the father of the present sultan died at Pekan, and his son Bendahara\r\n  Korish, who succeeded him, drove Wan Ahmad from the country. After\r\n  making three unsuccessful attempts to conquer the land and to dethrone\r\n  his elder brother, Wan Ahmad at last succeeded in 1865 in invading the\r\n  state and wresting the throne from his nephew, who had succeeded his\r\n  father some years earlier. From that time, in spite of two attempts to\r\n  shake his power by invasions from Selangor which were undertaken by\r\n  his nephews Wan Aman and Wan Da, Bendahara Ahmad ruled his country\r\n  with a rod of iron. In 1887 he consented to enter into a treaty with\r\n  the governor of the Straits by which he accepted a consular agent at\r\n  his court. This treaty was finally signed on the 8th of October 1887.\r\n  In February of the following year a Chinese British subject was\r\n  murdered at Pekan in circumstances which pointed to the responsibility\r\n  of the sultan for the crime, and in October 1888 a Resident was\r\n  appointed to assist the sultan in the administration of his country,\r\n  that being, in the opinion of the British government, the only\r\n  guarantee for the safety of the life and property of British subjects\r\n  which it could accept. In December 1891 disturbances broke out in\r\n  Pahang, the nominal leaders of which were certain of the sultan's most\r\n  trusted chiefs. The sultan himself took no part in the outbreak, but\r\n  it undoubtedly had his sympathy, even if it was not caused by his\r\n  direct commands. The rebels were driven to seek safety in flight in\r\n  November 1892, but in June 1894 they gathered strength for a second\r\n  disturbance, and raided Pahang from Kelantan, in which state they had\r\n  been given shelter by the Mahommedan rulers. This event, added to the\r\n  occurrence of other raids from across the border, led to an irregular\r\n  expedition being led into Trengganu and Kelantan by the Resident of\r\n  Pahang (Mr Hugh Clifford) in 1895, and this had the desired result.\r\n  The rebel chiefs were banished to Siam, and no further breach of the\r\n  peace has troubled the tranquillity of Pahang since that time. Pahang\r\n  joined the Federated Malay States by a treaty signed in 1895, and the\r\n  sultan and his principal chiefs were present at the federal durbar\r\n  held at Kuala Kangsar in Perak in 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Population.\r\n\r\n  The census taken in April 1901 gave the total population of Pahang at\r\n  84,113, of whom 73,462 were Malays, 8695 Chinese, 1227 Tamils and\r\n  other natives of India, 180 Europeans and Eurasians, and 549 people of\r\n  other nationalities. The population in 1905 was estimated at 100,000,\r\n  the increase being due to immigration mainly from the states on the\r\n  western seaboard. In former days Pahang was far more thickly populated\r\n  than in modern times, but the long succession of civil wars which\r\n  racked the land after the death of Bendahara Ali caused thousands of\r\n  Pahang Malays to fly the country. To-day the valley of the Lebir River\r\n  in Kelantan and the upper portions of several rivers near the Perak\r\n  and Selangor boundaries are inhabited by Pahang Malays, the\r\n  descendants of these fugitives. The Pahang natives are almost all\r\n  engaged in agriculture. The work of the mines, &c., is performed by\r\n  Chinese and foreign Malays. In the Lipis valley the descendants of the\r\n  Rawa Malays, who at one time possessed the whole of the interior in\r\n  defiance of the Pahang rajas, still outnumber the people of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finance and Trade.\r\n\r\n  The revenue of Pahang in 1899 amounted to only $62,077; in 1900 to\r\n  $419,150. In 1905 it was $528,368. The expenditure in 1905 amounted to\r\n  $1,208,176. Of this sum $736,886 was expended on public works. Pahang\r\n  is still a source of expense to the federation, its progress having\r\n  been retarded by the disturbances which lasted from December 1891\r\n  until 1895, with short intervals of peace, but the revenue is now\r\n  steadily increasing, and the ultimate financial success of the state\r\n  is considered to be secure. Pahang owes something over $3,966,500 to\r\n  Selangor and $1,175,000 to Perak, which have financed it now for some\r\n  years out of surplus revenue. The value of the imports in 1905 was\r\n  $1,344,346, that of the exports was $3,838,928, thus making a total\r\n  trade value of $5,183,274. The most valuable export is tin, the value\r\n  of which in 1905 amounted to $2,820,745. The value of the gutta\r\n  exported exceeded $140,000, that of dried and salted fish amounted to\r\n  nearly $70,000, and that of timber to $325,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n    General.\r\n\r\n  The geological formation of the states lying to the eastward of the\r\n  main range of mountains which splits the peninsula in twain differs\r\n  materially from that of the western states. At a distance of about a\r\n  dozen miles from the summits of the mountains the granite formation is\r\n  replaced by slates, which in many places are intersected by fissures\r\n  of quartz, and in others are overlaid by vast thicknesses of\r\n  limestone. Those of the quartz fissures which have been exploited are\r\n  found to be auriferous, and several mining companies have attempted to\r\n  work the deposits. Their efforts, however, have not hitherto been\r\n  successful. A magnificent road over the mountains, with a ruling grade\r\n  of 1 in 30, joins Kuala Lipis, the administrative capital of Pahang,\r\n  to Kuala Kubu, the nearest railway station in Selangor. The road\r\n  measures 82 m. in length. Pekan, where the sultan has his residence,\r\n  was the capital of Pahang until the middle of 1898, when the\r\n  administrative headquarters were transferred to the interior as being\r\n  more central. None of these towns is of any size or importance. In the\r\n  Kuantan valley, which lies parallel to the Pahang River, a European\r\n  company is working tin lodes with considerable success. These lodes\r\n  are the only mines of the kind being worked in the Federated Malay\r\n  States. Pahang is fertile and well suited for agriculture of many\r\n  kinds. The rainfall is heavy and regular. The climate is cooler than\r\n  that of the west coast, and the full force of the monsoon is felt from\r\n  October to February in each year. For administrative purposes Pahang\r\n  is divided into four districts--Ulu Pahang, in which the present\r\n  capital is situated; Temerloh, which includes 80 odd miles of the\r\n  Pahang valley and the Semantan River; Pekan, which includes the coast\r\n  rivers down to Endau; and Kuantan. Each of these is under the charge\r\n  of a district officer, who is responsible to the resident. The\r\n  boundary with Johor and the Negri Sembilan was rectified by a\r\n  commission which sat in London in 1897-1898.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--_Journal of the Eastern Archipelago_ (Singapore);\r\n  _Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society_\r\n  (Singapore); Maxwell, _Proceedings of the Royal Colonial Institute_,\r\n  vol. xxiii.; Swettenham, ibid. vol. xxvii; Clifford, ibid. vol. xxx.\r\n  (London, 1892, 1895, 1899); Swettenham, _About Perak_ (Singapore,\r\n  1893); _Malay Sketches_ (London, 1895); _The Real Malay_ (London,\r\n  1899); _British Malaya_ (London, 1906); Clifford, _In Court and\r\n  Kampong_ (London, 1897); _Studies in Brown Humanity_ (London, 1898);\r\n  _In a Corner of Asia_ (London, 1899); _Bush-whacking_ (London, 1901);\r\n  _Further India_ (London, 1904); De la Croix, _Les Mines d'etins de\r\n  Perak_ (Paris, 1882); Bluebook, C. 9524 (London, 1899); _The Straits\r\n  Directory_ (Singapore, 1906); Skeat, _Malay Magic_ (London, 1900);\r\n  Skeat and Blagden, _Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula_ (London,\r\n  1906).     (H. Cl.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--NON-FEDERATED STATES\r\n\r\nIn 1909 a treaty was made between Great Britain and Siam, one provision\r\nof which was the cession to the former of the suzerain rights enjoyed by\r\nthe latter over certain territories in the Malay Peninsula. These\r\nterritories consisted of the four Siamese Malay States: Kelantan,\r\nTrengganu, Kedah and Perlis, very ancient dependencies of Siam, all of\r\nwhich except Trengganu, were in a flourishing condition and had been\r\nadministered by British officers in the service of Siam for some years\r\nprior to their transference. Though the four states were loyal to Siam\r\nand wished to retain their former allegiance, the change was effected\r\nwithout disturbance of any kind, the British government on assuming the\r\nrights of suzerainty placing an adviser at the court of each raja and\r\nguaranteeing the continuance of the administration on the lines already\r\nlaid down by Siam so far as might be compatible with justice and fair\r\ntreatment for all. The four states lie to the north of the Federated\r\nMalay States, two on the east and two on the west side of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nKELANTAN.--This state on the east coast, bounded N. and N.E. by the\r\nChina Sea, E. by Trengganu, S. by Pahang and W. by Perak and Ra-ngé,\r\nlies between 4° 48´ and 6° 20´ N. and 101° 33´ and 102° 45´ E. The\r\ngreatest length from north to south is 115 m. and the greatest breadth\r\nfrom east to west 60 m. The area is about 5000 sq. m. The northern part\r\nof the state is flat and fertile, but the southern district which\r\ncomprises more than half the total area, is mountainous and\r\nuncultivated.\r\n\r\n  Next to the Pahang, the Kelantan River is the largest on the east\r\n  coast. It is 120 miles long and is navigable for shallow-draft\r\n  launches and big country boats for about 80 miles, and for vessels of\r\n  8 ft. draft for about six miles. Its principal tributaries are the\r\n  Galas, Pergau and Lebir. The Golok and Semarak rivers water the west\r\n  and east parts of the state, falling into the sea a few miles on\r\n  either side of the mouth of the Kelantan River. The climate of\r\n  Kelantan is mild and singularly healthy in the open cultivated\r\n  regions. The population is about 300,000 of which 10,000 are\r\n  aboriginal tribes (Sakeis and Jakuns), 10,000 Siamese and Chinese and\r\n  the rest Malays. The Chinese are increasing and natives of different\r\n  parts of India are resorting to the state for purposes of trade. Kota\r\n  Bharu (pop. 10,000) is the only town in the state. It lies on the\r\n  right bank of the river, about six miles from the sea. Since 1904 it\r\n  has been laid out with metalled roads and many public and private\r\n  buildings have been erected. The town is the commercial as well as the\r\n  administrative centre of the state. Tumpat and Tabar on the coast,\r\n  with population 4000 and 3000 respectively, are the places next in\r\n  importance after Kota Bharu. A network of creeks render communication\r\n  easy in the northern districts, the river and its tributaries afford\r\n  means of access to all parts of the south; 20 miles of road have been\r\n  made in the neighbourhood of Kota Bharu. Kelantan is connected by\r\n  telegraph with Bangkok and Singapore, and maintains regular postal\r\n  communication with those places. Rice cultivation is the principal\r\n  industry and is increasing rapidly. Coco-nut and betel-nut growing are\r\n  also largely practised. Much livestock is raised. About 400,000 acres\r\n  of land are under cultivation. Though reputed rich in minerals, past\r\n  misrule prevented mining enterprise in Kelantan until, in 1900, a\r\n  large concession was given to an Englishman and the country was opened\r\n  to foreigners. In 1909 three mining syndicates were at work, and\r\n  several others were in process of formation. Gold, tin and galena have\r\n  been found in several localities and during the years 1906-1909 28,000\r\n  ounces of gold were dredged from the Kelantan River. The Kelantanese\r\n  are expert fishermen, some 30,000 finding employment in fishing and\r\n  fish-drying. Silk-weaving is a growing industry. Foreign trade, which\r\n  in 1909 reached the value of two and a half million dollars, is\r\n  chiefly with Singapore. Principal exports are copra, rice, fish,\r\n  cattle and gold; chief imports are cotton goods, hardware and specie.\r\n  The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar and small silver coin,\r\n  supplemented by a locally made tin coin of low value.\r\n\r\n  By virtue of a mutual agreement made in 1902 Siam appointed a resident\r\n  commissioner to Kelantan and consented, so long as the advice of that\r\n  officer should be followed, to leave internal affairs to be conducted\r\n  locally. Under this arrangement a council of state was appointed,\r\n  departments of government were organized, penal, civil and revenue\r\n  laws were passed and enforced, courts were established and a police\r\n  force was raised. Though formerly of an evil reputation, the people\r\n  were found to be naturally peaceful and law-abiding, and serious crime\r\n  is rare. The state revenue, which was practically nothing in 1902,\r\n  amounted to $320,000 in 1907. Islamism was adopted about 300 years ago\r\n  but the old animistic superstitions are still strong. The state is\r\n  divided into _mukim_ or parishes, but the _imam_ no longer exercise\r\n  temporal authority. There are three schools at Kota Bharu, education\r\n  in the interior being in the hands of the imam assisted with\r\n  government grants.\r\n\r\n  No historical records of Kelantan exist, and the state was not noticed\r\n  by the European merchants of the 16th and 17th centuries. Consequently\r\n  little is known of its early history beyond what is to be gathered\r\n  from brief references in the Malay annals and the old chronicles of\r\n  Siam. The sites of ancient towns and the remains of former gold\r\n  diggings are visible here and there, but all knowledge of the men who\r\n  made these marks has been lost. The present ruling family dates from\r\n  about 1790. Siam was frequently called upon to maintain internal peace\r\n  and in 1892 a royal prince was sent to reside in Kelantan as\r\n  commissioner. Complications brought about by the incapacity of the\r\n  ruler led to the making of the agreement of 1902 above mentioned, to\r\n  the fixing of a regular tribute in money to Siam, and ultimately to\r\n  the merging of the state from chaotic lawlessness into the path of\r\n  reform. On the 15th of July 1909 the state came under British\r\n  suzerainty and the commissioner of Siam was replaced by a British\r\n  adviser, from which date the liability to payment of tribute ceased,\r\n  though in all other respects the administrative arrangements of Siam\r\n  remained unaltered.\r\n\r\nTRENGGANU.--This state on the east coast, bounded N. and N.E. by the\r\nChina Sea, S. by Pahang and W. by Pahang and Kelantan, lies between\r\nparallels 4° 4´ and 4° 46´ N. and 102° 30´ and 103° 26´ E. The greatest\r\nlength from north to south is 120 m., and the greatest breadth from east\r\nto west 50 m. It has a coast-line of 130 m. and an estimated area of\r\nabout 5000 sq. m. There are several islands off the coast, some of which\r\nare inhabited. The surface is generally mountainous.\r\n\r\n  Principal rivers are the Besut, Stiu, Trengganu, Dungun and Kmamun,\r\n  none of which is navigable for any distance. The climate is mild and\r\n  fairly healthy. The population numbers about 180,000, almost all\r\n  Malays, and mostly clusters round the mouths and lower reaches of the\r\n  rivers. The capital, which is situated at the mouth of the Trengganu\r\n  River, contains, with its suburbs, not less than 30,000 people.\r\n  Difficulty of access by river and by land render the interior\r\n  districts almost uninhabitable. Communication is maintained by boat\r\n  along the coast. There are no roads and no postal or telegraphic\r\n  communications.\r\n\r\n  The majority of the people are sailors and fishermen. Rice is grown,\r\n  but not in sufficient quantities to supply local needs. Much pepper\r\n  and gambier were at one time grown and exported, but about the year\r\n  1903 agriculture began to fall off owing to prevailing insecurity of\r\n  life and property. Not much livestock is raised, the few head of\r\n  cattle exported from Besut being mostly stolen from across the\r\n  neighbouring Kelantan border. A successful tin mine under European\r\n  control exists in the Kmamun district, but as everything possible was\r\n  done in the past to discourage all foreign enterprise, the probable\r\n  mineral wealth of the country is still practically untouched.\r\n  Silk-weaving, carried on entirely by the women, is a considerable\r\n  industry. The silk is imported raw and is re-exported in the form of\r\n  Malay clothing (_sarongs_) of patterns and quality which are widely\r\n  celebrated. The manufacture of native weapons and of brassware was at\r\n  one time brisk but is declining. The trade of Trengganu is not\r\n  increasing. It is valued roughly at about one and a half million\r\n  dollars a year, is chiefly with Singapore, and is to a great extent\r\n  carried in Trengganu-built ships, which latter also do some carrying\r\n  trade for other states on the east coast.\r\n\r\n  The Trengganu sultanate is one of the most ancient in the peninsula\r\n  and ranks with that of Riau. The state was feudatory to Malacca in the\r\n  13th century and during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries its\r\n  possession was frequently disputed between Malacca and Siam. The\r\n  present sultan is the descendant of an ancient family, the members of\r\n  which have quarrelled and fought with each other for the succession\r\n  from time immemorial. The last serious disturbance was in 1837 when\r\n  the grandfather of the present sultan stole the throne from his\r\n  nephew. Until the acquisition of the state by Great Britain a\r\n  triennial tribute of gold flowers was paid to Siam, and this with\r\n  occasional letters of instructions and advice, constituted almost the\r\n  only tangible evidence of Siamese suzerainty. Of government there was\r\n  practically none. The sultan, having alienated most of his powers and\r\n  prerogatives to his relatives, passed his life in religious seclusion\r\n  and was ruler in no more than name. The revenues were devoured by the\r\n  relatives, a small part of those accruing from the capital sufficing\r\n  for the sultan's needs. There were no written laws, no courts and no\r\n  police. All manner of crime was rampant, the peasantry was mercilessly\r\n  downtrodden, but the land was full of holy men and the cries of the\r\n  miserable were drowned in the noise of ostentatious prayer. In fine,\r\n  Trengganu presented in the beginning of the year 1909 the type of\r\n  untrammelled Malay rule which had fortunately disappeared from every\r\n  other state in the peninsula. In July of that year, however, the first\r\n  British adviser or agent arrived in the state, which was shortly\r\n  afterwards visited by the governor of the Straits Settlements, who\r\n  discussed with the sultan the changed conditions consequent upon the\r\n  Anglo-Siamese treaty and laid the foundations of future reform.\r\n\r\nKEDAH.--This state, on the west coast of the peninsula, lies between\r\nparallels 5° 20´ and 6° 42´ N., and is bounded, N. by Palit and Songkla,\r\nE. by Songkla and Raman, S. by Province Wellesley and Perak, and W. by\r\nthe sea. The coast-line is 65 m. long, the greatest distance from north\r\nto south is 115 m. and the greatest breadth 46 m. Off the coast lies a\r\ngroup of islands, the largest of which is Langkawi, well peopled and\r\nforming a district of the state.\r\n\r\n  The total area of Kedah is about 4000 sq. m. The land is low-lying and\r\n  swampy near the coast except towards the south where the height known\r\n  as Kedah Hill rises from the shore opposite Penang, flat and fertile\r\n  farther inland, and mountainous towards the eastern border. The rivers\r\n  are small, the Sungei Kedah, navigable for a few miles for vessels of\r\n  50 tons, and the S. Muda, which forms the boundary with Province\r\n  Wellesley, being the only streams worthy of notice. The plains are\r\n  formed of marine deposit, and in the mountains limestone and granite\r\n  preponderate. The population is estimated at 220,000, of whom about\r\n  100,000 are Malays, 50,000 Siamese and Samsams and 70,000 Chinese and\r\n  Madrassis (Klings). There are three towns of importance. Alor Star,\r\n  the capital, on the Kedah river, 10 miles from the sea, in a flat,\r\n  unhealthy, but fertile locality, is a well laid out town with good\r\n  streets, many handsome public and private buildings, and good\r\n  wharfage for small vessels. The population is about 20,000, of whom\r\n  more than half are Chinese and the remainder government servants and\r\n  retainers of the local aristocracy. Kuala Muda (pop. 10,000) and Kulim\r\n  (pop. 8000) situated in the south, are unimposing collections of small\r\n  birch houses and thatched bamboo huts; the latter is the centre of the\r\n  Kedah tin mining industry. The bulk of the population is scattered\r\n  over the plains in small villages. A good road runs north from Alor\r\n  Star to the border of the state, a distance of 40 miles, and other\r\n  roads are being constructed. The state has 185 miles of telegraph line\r\n  and 75 miles of telephone line. Mails are closed daily at Alor Star\r\n  for Penang and there is a good internal postal service. The chief\r\n  industry is rice cultivation. Coco-nut, betel-nut and fruit\r\n  plantations are many, and the cultivation of rubber has recently been\r\n  taken up with prospects of success. The estimated area under\r\n  cultivation is about 300,000 acres. There are rice-mills at Alor Star\r\n  and at Kuala Muda. The principal exports are rice, cattle and tin. The\r\n  chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, hardware and raw silk.\r\n  Accurate trade statistics are not available. The ruler holds the rank\r\n  of sultan and is assisted in the government by a council and by the\r\n  British adviser who since the state passed from Siamese to British\r\n  protection in 1909, has replaced the officer formerly appointed by\r\n  Siam. The sultan comes of a family long recognized by Siam as having\r\n  hereditary right to the rulership. The penal and civil laws are\r\n  administered in accordance with the precepts of Islamism, the official\r\n  religion of the state. Though much has been done to improve the\r\n  courts, justice is not easily obtainable. A land registration system\r\n  is in force but is in a state of confusion, though a land law passed\r\n  in 1905 gives security of tenure over lands newly acquired. The mining\r\n  laws are similar to those of Siam. In 1905 the Siamese government\r\n  advanced two and a half million dollars to Kedah, to pay the debts of\r\n  the state, which sum was refunded by the British Government on\r\n  assuming the position of protector. The annual revenue is $1,000,000\r\n  and the expenditure about the same. Chief heads of revenue are opium\r\n  and land tax. Many revenue monopolies, created in the past, have not\r\n  yet expired; but for this the revenue would be greater than it is.\r\n  There is no army. In 1906 the police service was reorganized under\r\n  British officers, resulting in great improvement to this department.\r\n  The state is divided into a number of administrative districts under\r\n  Malay officials. Each district comprises several _mukim_ or parishes,\r\n  the _imam_ of which exercise both spiritual and temporal control.\r\n  There are schools in the chief towns, but education has not yet been\r\n  seriously undertaken.\r\n\r\n  Kedah was founded by colonists from India in A.D. 1200, about which\r\n  time the Siamese had subdued Nakhon Sri Tammarat and claimed the whole\r\n  Malay Peninsula. When the rise of Malacca shook Siamese authority in\r\n  the peninsula, Kedah oscillated between them, and on the conquest of\r\n  Malacca by the Portuguese, fell to Siam, though the capital was raided\r\n  and burnt by the Europeans. The ruler and his people were converted to\r\n  Islam in the 15th century. In 1768, the Siamese kingdom being\r\n  disorganized, the sultan of Kedah entered into direct political\r\n  relations with the Hon. East India Company, leasing the island of\r\n  Penang to the latter. Further treaties followed in 1791 and 1802, but\r\n  in 1821 Siam reasserted her control, expelling the rebellious sultan\r\n  after a sanguinary war. The sultan made several fruitless efforts to\r\n  recover the state, and at length made full submission, when he was\r\n  reinstated. In 1868 an agreement between Great Britain and Siam was\r\n  substituted for the treaties of the East India Company with the\r\n  sultan. The present sultan succeeded in 1881, and for 14 years\r\n  governed well, but in 1895 he began to contract debts and to leave the\r\n  government to his minions. The result was chaos, and in 1905 the\r\n  Siamese government had to intervene to avert a condition of\r\n  bankruptcy, adjusting the finances and reorganizing the general\r\n  administration to such effect that when, four years later, the state\r\n  became a British dependency, a government was found established on a\r\n  sound basis and requiring nothing but the presence of a firm and\r\n  experienced officer as adviser to maintain its efficiency and assist\r\n  its further advance.\r\n\r\nPERLIS (_Palit_).--This small state, consisting of the left bank\r\ndrainage area of the Perlis River, lies between Setul and Kedah, which\r\nbound it on the N. and W. and on the E. respectively. It touches the sea\r\nonly round the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\n  The population is about 10,000, Malays and Chinese. The chief town,\r\n  Perlis, is situated about 12 m. up the river. A good deal of tin is\r\n  worked, and rice and pepper are grown and exported. In the early part\r\n  of the 19th century Perlis was a district of Kedah, but during a\r\n  period of disturbance in the latter state it established itself as a\r\n  separate chiefdom. In 1897 Siam restored the nominal authority of\r\n  Kedah, but the measure was not productive of good. In 1905 the Siamese\r\n  government advanced a loan of $200,000 to Perlis, and appointed an\r\n  English adviser to assist in the general administration. This money\r\n  was refunded to Siam and the adviser relieved by a British officer\r\n  when the state became British in July 1909. The condition of the state\r\n  has improved, but the revenue, $80,000, is not sufficient for the\r\n  immediate needs of government.\r\n\r\n  Authorities.--Norman, _The Far East_ (London, 1895); H.

(W. A. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAY STATES (SIAMESE). The authority of Siam, which at one time covered\r\nthe whole of the Malay peninsula, now extends southward to an irregular\r\nline drawn across the Peninsula at about 6° 30´ N. Between that line and\r\nthe Isthmus of Kra, usually accepted as the northernmost point of the\r\nMalay Peninsula, there lie some 20,000 sq. m. of territory inhabited by\r\na mixed population of Siamese and Malays with here and there a few\r\nremnants of the aboriginal inhabitants clinging to the wilder districts,\r\nand with a few Chinese settlers engaged in commerce. Formerly this tract\r\nwas divided into a number of states, each of which was ruled by a chief\r\n(Siamese, _Chao Muang_; Malay, _raja_), who held his title from the king\r\nof Siam, but, subject to a few restrictions, conducted the affairs of\r\nhis state in accordance with his own desires; the office of chief,\r\nmoreover, was hereditary, subject always to the approval of the\r\nsuzerain. The states formed two groups: a northern, including Langsuan,\r\nChaya, Nakhon Sri Tammarat, Songkla, Renawng, Takoapa, Pang Nga, Tongka\r\nand Trang, in which the Siamese element predominated and of which the\r\nchiefs were usually Siamese or Chinese; and a southern, including\r\nPalean, Satun (Setul), Patani, Raman, Jering, Sai (Teloban), Re Nge\r\n(Legeh), Yala (Jalor) and Nong Chik, in which the population was\r\nprincipally Malay and the ruler also Malay. Four other states of the\r\nsouthern group, Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah and Perlis, of which the\r\npopulation is entirely Malay, passed from Siamese to British protection\r\nin 1909.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual consolidation of the Siamese kingdom all the states of\r\nthe northern group have been incorporated as ordinary provinces of Siam\r\n(q.v.), the hereditary _Chao Muang_ having died or been pensioned and\r\nreplaced by officials of the Siamese Civil Service, while the states\r\nthemselves now constitute provinces of the administrative divisions of\r\nChumpon, Nakhon Sri Tammarat and Puket. The states of the southern\r\ngroup, however, retain their hereditary rulers, each of whom presides\r\nover a council and governs with the aid of a Siamese assistant\r\ncommissioner and with a staff of Siamese district officials, subject to\r\nthe general control of high commissioners under whom the states are\r\ngrouped. This southern group, with a total area of about 7000 sq. m. and\r\na population of 375,000, constitutes the Siamese Malay States. A British\r\nconsul with headquarters at Puket, and a vice-consul who resides at\r\nSongkla, watch over the interests of British subjects in the states of\r\nthe west and east sides of the peninsula respectively. Other foreign\r\npowers are unrepresented.\r\n\r\n  _Palean._--This small state on the west coast, bounded N. by the\r\n  province of Trang, E. by the Songkla division, S. by the state of\r\n  Setul, and W. by the sea, is about 900 sq. m. in area, and has a\r\n  population of about 20,000. It is attached for administrative purposes\r\n  to the province of Trang, and its people are chiefly engaged in the\r\n  cultivation of pepper, of which about 150 tons are annually exported.\r\n  A few tin mines are also worked.\r\n\r\n  _Satun_ (_Setul_).--This small state, bounded N. by Palean, E. by\r\n  Songkla, S. by Perlis, and W. by the sea, contains about 1000 sq. m.\r\n  area with a population of about 25,000, Malays, Siamese and a few\r\n  Chinese. The principal production is pepper, which is exported in\r\n  junks and in the small Penang steamers which ply on the west coast of\r\n  the peninsula. In 1897 Setul was placed under the control of Kedah,\r\n  then a Siamese dependency, but the arrangement was not a success, and\r\n  in 1907 the Siamese government was forced, owing to prevailing\r\n  corruption and misrule, to restrict the powers of the chief and,\r\n  cancelling the authority of Kedah, to place him to some extent under\r\n  the orders of the high commissioner of Songkla. By the terms of the\r\n  Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 about half of the state of Perlis was\r\n  added to Satun, an arrangement by which the importance of the latter\r\n  was considerably increased.\r\n\r\n  _Patani._--The seven Malay states of Nawng Chik, Patani, Jering, Yala\r\n  (Jalor), Sai (Teloban), Raman and Ra-ngé (Legeh) were constituted from\r\n  the old state of Patani at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1906\r\n  they were reunited to form the Patani administrative division of Siam,\r\n  but each state retains its Malay ruler, who governs jointly with a\r\n  Siamese officer under the direction of the Siamese high commissioner,\r\n  and many of the ancient privileges and customs of Malay government are\r\n  preserved. The group of States is situated between 5° 34´ and 6° 52´\r\n  N. and 100° 54´ and 101° 58´ E. It is bounded N. by the China Sea, E.\r\n  by the China Sea and Kelantan, S. by Perak, and W. by Kedah. The total\r\n  area is about 5000 sq. m. The country is mountainous except close to\r\n  the coast. The principal rivers are the Patani and the Teloban, long,\r\n  winding and shallow, and navigable for small boats only. The\r\n  population is about 335,000, of whom the great majority are Malays.\r\n  Each state has its capital, but Patani (the headquarters of the high\r\n  commissioner) is the only town of importance. Communications are poor\r\n  and are chiefly by river, but roads are under construction. Patani and\r\n  Sai are in telegraphic communication with Bangkok and Singapore, and\r\n  regular weekly mails are despatched to those places. The area under\r\n  cultivation is small except round about Patani and in Nawng Chik,\r\n  where much rice is grown. Tin mining is a growing industry; many\r\n  Chinese own mines and several European syndicates are at work in\r\n  Raman, Ra-ngé and Patani, prospecting for, or mining, this metal.\r\n  Fishing and salt-evaporation occupy a large proportion of the\r\n  population. The annual export of tin is about 400 tons, and dried\r\n  fish, salt, cattle and elephants are other exports. Steamers up to 300\r\n  tons maintain frequent communication with Bangkok and Singapore, and\r\n  the Patani roads afford good anchorage at all seasons.\r\n\r\n  Mahommedan law is followed in the settlement of inherited property\r\n  disputes and of matrimonial affairs; otherwise the laws of Siam\r\n  obtain. Efficient law courts have been established in each state, and\r\n  there is a serviceable force of gendarmerie recruited from amongst\r\n  Malays and Siamese alike. The revenue amounts to about 600,000 ticals,\r\n  or £45,000 a year, one-third being payable to the rulers as private\r\n  income for themselves and their relatives, one-third expended on the\r\n  administration, and one-third reserved for special purposes, but it is\r\n  usually found necessary to devote the last-mentioned third to the\r\n  expenses of administration. Patani has been subject to Siam from the\r\n  remotest times. It is said that the old state adopted Islamism in the\r\n  16th century, the chief, a relative of the kings of Siam, embracing\r\n  that religion and at the same time revolting to Malacca. It has\r\n  several times been necessary to send punitive expeditions to recall\r\n  the state to its allegiance. The present rulers are mostly descended\r\n  from the ruling families of the neighbouring state of Kelantan, but\r\n  the chief of Patani itself is a member of the family which ruled there\r\n  in the days of its greatness. Throughout the 17th century Patani was\r\n  resorted to by Portuguese, Dutch and English merchants, who had\r\n  factories ashore and used the place as an emporium for trade with\r\n  Siam. In 1621 an engagement took place in the Patani roads between\r\n  three Dutch and two British ships, the latter being taken after the\r\n  president of the British merchants, John Jourdain, had been killed. In\r\n  1899 the border between the state of Perak and Raman was fixed by an\r\n  agreement between England and Siam, a dispute of old standing being\r\n  thereby settled, but the question was reopened in the negotiations\r\n  which preceded the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, when a new border\r\n  line was fixed between British and Siamese possessions in the\r\n  Peninsula.     (W. A. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALCHIN, a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\non the river Peene, between lakes Malchin and Kummerow, 28 m. by rail\r\nN.W. of Neu-Brandenburg. Pop. (1900), 7449. It is, alternately with\r\nSternberg, the place of assembly of the Diet of Mecklenburg. Here are\r\nthe châteaux of Remplin, Basedow and Schlitz; a church dating from the\r\n14th century, and a fine town-hall. The well-wooded and undulating\r\ncountry, environing the shores of Lake Malchin, is known as the\r\n\"Mecklenburg Switzerland,\" and is increasing in favour as a summer\r\nresort. A canal unites Lake Kummerow with the Peene. The industries of\r\nthe town include the manufacture of sugar and bricks, and brewing and\r\nmalting. Malchin became a town in 1236.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALCOLM, the name of four kings of the Scots, two of whom, MALCOLM I.,\r\nking from 943 to 954, and MALCOLM II., king from 1005 to 1034, are\r\nshadowy and unimportant personages.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM III. (d. 1093), called Canmore or the \"large-headed,\" was a son\r\nof King Duncan I., and became king after the defeat of the usurper\r\nMacbeth in July 1054, being crowned at Scone in April 1057. Having\r\nmarried as his second wife, (St) Margaret (q.v.), a sister of Edgar\r\nÆtheling, who was a fugitive at his court, he invaded England in 1070 to\r\nsupport the claim of Edgar to the English throne, returning to Scotland\r\nwith many captives after harrying Northumbria. William the Conqueror\r\nanswered this attack by marching into Scotland in 1072, whereupon\r\nMalcolm made peace with the English king at Abernethy and \"was his man.\"\r\nHowever, in spite of this promise he ravaged the north of England again\r\nand again, until in 1091 William Rufus invaded Scotland and received his\r\nsubmission. Then in 1092 a fresh dispute arose between the two kings,\r\nand William summoned Malcolm to his court at Gloucester. The Scot\r\nobeyed, and calling at Durham on his southward journey was present at\r\nthe foundation of Durham Cathedral. When he reached Gloucester Rufus\r\nrefused to receive him unless he did homage for his kingdom; he declined\r\nand returned home in high dudgeon. Almost at once he invaded\r\nNorthumbria, and was killed at a place afterwards called Malcolm's\r\nCross, near Alnwick, on the 13th of November 1093. Four of Malcolm's\r\nsons, Duncan II., Edgar, Alexander I., and David I., became kings of\r\nScotland; and one of his daughters, Matilda, became the wife of Henry I.\r\nof England, a marriage which united the Saxon and the Norman royal\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM IV. (c. 1141-1165) was the eldest son of Henry, earl of\r\nHuntingdon (d. 1152), son of King David I., and succeeded his\r\ngrandfather David as king of Scotland in 1153. He is called the\r\n\"Maiden,\" and died unmarried on the 9th of December 1165.\r\n\r\n  See E. A. Freeman, _The Norman Conquest_, vols. iv. and v.\r\n  (1867-1879), and _The Reign of William Rufus_ (1882); W. F. Skene,\r\n  _Celtic Scotland_ (1876-1880); E. W. Robertson, _Scotland under her\r\n  Early Kings_ (1862); and A. Lang, _History of Scotland_, vol. i.\r\n  (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALCOLM, SIR JOHN (1769-1833), Anglo-Indian soldier, diplomatist,\r\nadministrator and author, was born at Burnfoot on the Esk, near\r\nLangholm, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, on the 2nd of May 1769. His father\r\nwas a humble farmer, but three of his sons attained the honour of\r\nknighthood. At the age of twelve he received a cadetship in the Indian\r\narmy, and in April 1783 he landed at Madras, shortly afterwards joining\r\nhis regiment at Vellore. In 1792, having for some time devoted himself\r\nto the study of Persian, he was appointed to the staff of Lord\r\nCornwallis as Persian interpreter, but two years afterwards was\r\ncompelled by ill health to leave for England. On his return to India in\r\n1796 he became military secretary to Sir Alured Clarke,\r\ncommander-in-chief at Madras, and afterwards to his successor General\r\nHarris; and in 1798 he was appointed by Lord Wellesley assistant to the\r\nresident at Hyderabad. In the last-mentioned capacity he highly\r\ndistinguished himself by the manner in which he gave effect to the\r\ndifficult measure of disbanding the French corps in the pay of the\r\nnizam. In 1799, under the walls of Seringapatam, began his intimacy with\r\nColonel Arthur Wellesley, which in a short time ripened into a lifelong\r\nfriendship. In the course of the same year he acted as first secretary\r\nto the commission appointed to settle the Mysore government, and before\r\nits close he was appointed by Lord Wellesley to proceed as envoy to the\r\ncourt of Persia for the purpose of counteracting the policy of the\r\nFrench by inducing that country to form a British alliance. Arriving at\r\nTeheran in December 1800, he was successful in negotiating favourable\r\ntreaties, both political and commercial, and returned to Bombay by way\r\nof Bagdad in May 1801. He now for some time held the interim post of\r\nprivate secretary to Lord Wellesley, and in 1803 was appointed to the\r\nMysore residency. At the close of the Mahratta War, in 1804, and again\r\nin 1805, he negotiated important treaties with Sindhia and Holkar, and\r\nin 1806, besides seeing the arrangements arising out of these alliances\r\ncarried out, he directed the difficult work of reducing the immense body\r\nof irregular native troops. In 1808 he was again sent on a mission to\r\nPersia, but circumstances prevented him from getting beyond Bushire; on\r\nhis reappointment in 1810, he was successful indeed in procuring a\r\nfavourable reception at court, but otherwise his embassy, if the\r\ninformation which he afterwards incorporated in his works on Persia be\r\nleft out of account, was (through no fault of his) without any\r\nsubstantial result. He sailed for England in 1811, and shortly after his\r\narrival in the following year was knighted. His intervals of leisure he\r\ndevoted to literary work, and especially to the composition of a\r\n_History of Persia_, which was published in two quarto volumes in 1815.\r\nOn his return to India in 1817 he was appointed by Lord Moira his\r\npolitical agent in the Deccan, with eligibility for military command; as\r\nbrigadier-general under Sir T. Hislop he took a distinguished part in\r\nthe victory of Mehidpur (December 21, 1817), as also in the subsequent\r\nwork of following up the fugitives, determining the conditions of peace\r\nand settling the country. In 1821 he returned once more to England,\r\nwhere he remained until 1827, when he was appointed governor of Bombay.\r\nHis influence in this office was directed to the promotion of various\r\neconomical reforms and useful administrative measures. Leaving India for\r\nthe last time in 1830, he shortly after his arrival in England entered\r\nparliament as member for Launceston, and was an active opponent of the\r\nReform Bill. He died of paralysis on the 30th of May 1833.\r\n\r\n  Besides the work mentioned above, Sir John Malcolm published _Sketch\r\n  of the Political History of India since ... 1784_ (in 1811 and 1826);\r\n  _Sketch of the Sikhs_ (1812); _Observations on the Disturbances in the\r\n  Madras Army in 1809_ (1812); _Persia, a Poem_, anonymous (1814); _A\r\n  Memoir of Central India_ (2 vols., 1823); and _Sketches of Persia_,\r\n  anonymous (1827). A posthumous work, _Life of Robert, Lord Clive_,\r\n  appeared in 1836. See _Life and Correspondence of Sir John Malcolm_,\r\n  by J. W. Kaye (2 vols., 1856).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALDA, a district of British India, in the Rajshahi division of Eastern\r\nBengal and Assam. Area, 1899 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 884,030, showing an\r\nincrease of 8.5 in the decade. The administrative headquarters are at\r\nEnglish Bazar (pop. 13,667) near the town of Old Malda. The district is\r\ndivided into two almost equal parts by the Mahananda river, flowing from\r\nnorth to south. The western tract between the Mahananda and the main\r\nstream of the Ganges is an alluvial plain of sandy soil and great\r\nfertility. The eastern half is an elevated region broken by the deep\r\nvalleys of the Tangan and Purnabhaba rivers and their small tributary\r\nstreams. The soil here is a hard red clay; and the whole is overgrown\r\nwith thorny tree jungle known as the _katal_. Agricultural prosperity\r\ncentres on the Mahananda, where mango orchards and high raised plots of\r\nmulberry land extend continuously along both banks of the river. The\r\nGanges nowhere intersects the district, but skirts it from its\r\nnorth-western corner to the extreme south. The Mahananda flows in a deep\r\nwell-defined channel through the centre, and joins the Ganges at the\r\nsouthern corner. Its tributaries are the Kalindri on the right, and the\r\nTangan and Purnabhaba on the left bank. The two principal industries are\r\nthe production of indigo and silk. The first has declined, and so has\r\nthe second as far as concerns the weaving of piece goods, but the\r\nrearing of silkworms and the export of raw silk and silk thread are\r\ncarried on upon a large scale. No railway touches the district, but the\r\ncommunications by water are good.\r\n\r\n  Malda supplied two great capitals to the early Mahommedan kings of\r\n  Bengal; and the sites of Gaur and Pandua exhibit the most interesting\r\n  remains to be found in the lower valley of the Ganges. (See GAUR.) The\r\n  connexion of the East India Company with Malda dates from a very early\r\n  period. As far back as 1676 there was a factory there. In 1770 English\r\n  Bazar was fixed upon for a commercial residency, the buildings of\r\n  which at the present day form both the public offices and private\r\n  residence of the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALDEN, a city, including several villages, of Middlesex county,\r\nMassachusetts, U.S.A., on the Malden river, about 5 m. N. of Boston.\r\nPop. (1890), 23,031, (1900), 33,664, of whom 9513 were foreign-born,\r\n3673 being English Canadians, 870 English, and 617 Swedes; (1910 census)\r\n44,404. Malden had in 1906 a land area of 4.78 sq. m. It is served by\r\nthe Boston & Maine railroad, and by inter-urban electric railways.\r\nAlthough it is largely a residential suburb of Boston--its post office\r\nis a Boston sub-station--it has important manufacturing industries. The\r\nmost valuable manufactured product is rubber boots and shoes. The\r\ncapital invested in manufacturing in 1905 was $5,553,432; and the value\r\nof the factory product, $11,235,635, was 70.2% greater than the value of\r\nthe factory product in 1900. Among Malden's institutions are the public\r\nlibrary (endowed by Elisha S. Converse), the Malden hospital, the Malden\r\nday nursery, a Young Men's Christian Association, and a home for the\r\naged. A fine system of parks is maintained; the best known is possibly\r\nPine Banks. To the north and west is the Middlesex Fells, a state\r\nreservation; about 60 acres of this and about 20 acres of the Middlesex\r\nFells Parkway lie within Malden. Malden, when first settled about 1640,\r\nwas part of Charlestown, and was known for some years as Mystic Side. It\r\nwas incorporated as a town under the name of \"Mauldon\" in 1640, and was\r\nchartered as a city in 1881. The north part of Malden was set off in\r\n1850 to form Melrose, and the south part in 1870 to form the town of\r\nEverett. Malden was the birthplace of Adoniram Judson, the \"apostle to\r\nBurma.\" Michael Wigglesworth was pastor here from 1656 until 1705.\r\n\r\n  See D. P. Corey, _History of Malden_ (Malden, 1899); and _Malden, Past\r\n  and Present_ (Malden, 1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALDIVE ISLANDS, an archipelago of coral islets in the Indian Ocean,\r\nforming a chain between 7° 6´ N. and 0° 42´ S. It consists of seventeen\r\natolls with an immense number of islands, of which some three hundred\r\nare inhabited. In the extreme south are the isolated atolls of Addu and\r\nFua-Mulaku, separated from Suvadiva by the Equatorial Channel, which is\r\nitself separated from the main chain of atolls by One-and-a-half-degree\r\nChannel.[1] Following the chain northward from this channel, we have\r\nHaddumati and Kolumadulu, after which the chain becomes double: to the\r\neast the chief atolls are Mulaku, Felidu, South Malé, North Malé,\r\nKardiva (where the channel of the same name, 35 m. broad, partly breaks\r\nthe chain), and Fadiffolu. To the west are South Nilandu, North Nilandu,\r\nAri, South Mahlos, North Mahlos and Miladumadulu. To the north again are\r\nTiladumati and Ihavandifulu. Finally, to the north of Eight-degree\r\nChannel is Minikoi, 71 m. from the nearest point of the Maldives, and\r\n110 m. from that of the Laccadives to the north. The main part of the\r\narchipelago, north of One-and-a-half-degree Channel, consists of a\r\nseries of banks either surrounded or studded all over with reefs (see J.\r\nS. Gardiner, \"Formation of the Maldives,\" in _Geographical Journ._ xix.\r\n277 seq.). Mr Gardiner regarded these banks as plateaus rising to\r\ndifferent elevations beneath the surface of the sea from a main plateau\r\nrising steeply from the great depths of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nAfter the Portuguese, from about 1518 onwards, had attempted many times\r\nto establish themselves on the islands by force, and after the\r\nMaldivians had endured frequent raids by the Mopla pirates of the\r\nMalabar coast, they began to send tokens of homage and claims of\r\nprotection (the first recorded being in 1645) to the rulers of Ceylon,\r\nand their association with this island has continued practically ever\r\nsince. The hereditary sultan of the archipelago is tributary to the\r\nBritish government of Ceylon. The population of the Maldives is\r\nestimated at 30,000. All are Mahommedans. By Messrs. Gardiner and Cooper\r\nthey are classed in four ethnological divisions. (1) Those of the atolls\r\nnorth of the Kardiva Channel. Here the reefs are generally less perfect\r\nthan elsewhere, seldom forming complete central lagoons, and as they\r\nwere formerly exposed to the constant attacks of the Mopla pirates from\r\nIndia, the people are hardier and more vigorous than their less warlike\r\nsouthern neighbours. They annually visited the coasts of India or\r\nCeylon, and often married Indian wives, thus acquiring distinct racial\r\ncharacters of an approximately Dravidian type. (2) Those of the central\r\ndivision, comprising the atolls between North Malé and Haddumati, who\r\nare under the direct rule of the sultan, and have been more exposed to\r\nArab influences. They formerly traded with Arabia and Malaysia, and many\r\nArabs settled amongst them, so that they betray a strong strain of\r\nSemitic blood in their features. (3 and 4) The natives of Suvadiva,\r\nAddu, Mulaku and the other southern clusters, who have had little\r\ncommunication with the Central Malé people, and probably preserve more\r\nof the primitive type, approximating in appearance to the Sinhalese\r\nvillagers of Ceylon. They are an intelligent and industrious people,\r\ngrowing their own crops, manufacturing their own cloth and mats, and\r\nbuilding their own boats, while many read Arabic more or less fluently,\r\nalthough still believers in magic and witchcraft. The language is a\r\ndialect of Sinhalese, but indicating a separation of ancient date and\r\nmore or less mahommedanized.\r\n\r\nThe sultan's residence and the capital of the archipelago is the island\r\nof Malé. From the earliest notices the production of coir, the\r\ncollection of cowries, and the weaving of excellent textures on these\r\nislands have been noted. The chief exports of the islands besides coir\r\nand cowries (a decreasing trade) are coco-nuts, copra, tortoise-shell\r\nand dried bonito-fish.\r\n\r\nMinikoi atoll, with the numerous wrecks on its reefs, its lighthouse,\r\nand its position on the track of all eastward-bound vessels, is a\r\nfamiliar sight to seafarers in these waters. The atoll, which is\r\npear-shaped and disposed in the direction from S.W. to N.E. is 5 m.\r\nlong, with an extreme breadth of nearly 3 m., with a large but shallow\r\nlagoon approached from the north by a passage two fathoms deep. The\r\natoll is growing outwards on every side, and at one place rises 19 ft.\r\nabove sea-level. The population, which numbers about 3000, is sharply\r\ndivided into five castes, of which the three highest are pure\r\nMaldivians, the lower two the same as in the Laccadives. All are centred\r\nin a small village opposite Mou Rambu Point on the west or lagoon side;\r\nbut most of the men are generally absent, many being employed with the\r\nLascar crews on board the large liners plying in the eastern seas.\r\n\r\n  In 1899-1900 Messrs. J. Stanley Gardiner and C. Forster Cooper carried\r\n  out an expedition to the Maldives and Laccadives, for the important\r\n  results of which see _The Fauna and Geography of the Maldive and\r\n  Laccadive Archipelagoes_, ed. J. S. Gardiner (Cambridge, 1901-1905),\r\n  also _Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society_, vol. xi.\r\n  pt. 1 (1900), and the _Geographical Journ._, _loc. cit._, &c. A French\r\n  adventurer, François Pyrard de la Val, was wrecked in the Maldives in\r\n  1602 and detained there five years; he wrote an interesting account of\r\n  the archipelago, _Voyage de F. P. de la Val_ (Paris, 1679; previous\r\n  editions 1611, &c.). See also A. Agassiz, \"An Expedition to the\r\n  Maldives\" in _Amer. Journ. Science_, vol. xiii.

E.N.E. from London by a branch from\r\nWitham of the Great Eastern railway. Pop. (1901), 5565. There are east\r\nand west railway stations. The church of All Saints, dating from 1056,\r\nbut, as it stands, Early English and later, consists of chancel, nave\r\nand aisles, with a triangular Early English tower (a unique form) at the\r\nwest end surmounted by a hexagonal spire. The tower of St Mary's Church\r\nshows Norman work with Roman materials. The other public buildings are\r\nthe grammar school, founded in 1547; the town-hall, formerly D'Arcy's\r\ntower, built in the reign of Henry VI.; and the public hall. There are\r\nmanufactures of crystallized salt, breweries, an oyster fishery and some\r\nshipping. On Osea Island, in the Blackwater estuary, there is a farm\r\ncolony for the unemployed. A mile west of Maldon are remains of Beeleigh\r\nAbbey, a Premonstratensian foundation of the 12th century. They consist\r\nof the chapter-house and another chamber, and are of fine Early English\r\nwork. The borough is under a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area,\r\n3028 acres.\r\n\r\nAt Maldon (_Maelduna_, _Melduna_, _Mealdon_ or _Meaudon_) palaeolithic,\r\nneolithic and Roman remains that have been found seem to indicate an\r\nearly settlement. It is not, however, an important Roman site. An\r\nearthwork, of which traces exist, may be Saxon or Danish. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle relates that Edward the Elder established a \"burh\"\r\nthere about 921, and that Ealdorman Brihtnoth was killed there by the\r\nDanes in 991. The position of Maldon may have given it some commercial\r\nimportance, but the fortress is the point emphasized by the Chronicle.\r\nMaldon remained a royal town up to the reign of Henry I., and thus is\r\nentered as on _terra regis_ in Domesday. Henry II. granted the burgesses\r\ntheir first charter, probably in 1155, giving them the land of the\r\nborough and suburb with sac and soc and other judicial rights, also\r\nfreedom from county and forest jurisdiction, danegeld, scutage, tallage\r\nand all tolls, by the service of one ship a year for forty days. This\r\ncharter was confirmed by Edward I. in 1290, by Edward III. in 1344, and\r\nby Richard II. in 1378. In 1403 the bishop of London granted further\r\njudicial and financial rights, and Henry V. confirmed the charters in\r\n1417, Henry VI. in 1443, and Henry VIII. in 1525. Maldon was\r\nincorporated by Philip and Mary in 1554, and received confirmatory\r\ncharters from Elizabeth in 1563 and 1592, from Charles I. in 1631,\r\nCharles II. and James II. In 1768 the incorporation charter was\r\nregranted, with modifications in 1810.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALEBRANCHE, NICOLAS (1638-1715), French philosopher of the Cartesian\r\nschool, the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to Louis\r\nXIII., and Catherine de Lauzon, sister of a viceroy of Canada, was born\r\nat Paris on the 6th of August 1638. Deformed and constitutionally\r\nfeeble, he received his elementary education from a tutor, and left home\r\nonly when sufficiently advanced to enter upon a course of philosophy at\r\nthe Collège de la Marche, and subsequently to study theology at the\r\nSorbonne. He had resolved to take holy orders, but his studious\r\ndisposition led him to decline a stall in Notre Dame, and in 1660 he\r\njoined the congregation of the Oratory. He was first advised by Père\r\nLecointe to devote himself to ecclesiastical history, and laboriously\r\nstudied Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen and Theodoret, but \"the facts\r\nrefused to arrange themselves in his mind, and mutually effaced one\r\nanother.\" Richard Simon undertook to teach him Hebrew and Biblical\r\ncriticism with no better success. At last in 1664 he chanced to read\r\nDescartes's _Traité de l'homme_ (_de homine_), which moved him so deeply\r\nthat (it is said) he was repeatedly compelled by palpitations of the\r\nheart to lay aside his reading. Malebranche was from that hour\r\nconsecrated to philosophy, and after ten years' study of the works of\r\nDescartes he produced the famous _De la recherche de la vérité_,\r\nfollowed at intervals by other works, both speculative and\r\ncontroversial. Like most of the great metaphysicians of the 17th\r\ncentury, Malebranche interested himself also in questions of mathematics\r\nand natural philosophy, and in 1699 was admitted an honorary member of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences. During his later years his society was much\r\ncourted, and he received many visits from foreigners of distinction. He\r\ndied on the 13th of October 1715; his end was said to have been hastened\r\nby a metaphysical argument into which he had been drawn in the course of\r\nan interview with Bishop Berkeley.

It ranks as one\r\nof the Cis-Sutlej states, which came under British influence in 1809.\r\nThe territory lies south of Ludhiana. Area, 167 sq. m. Pop. (1901),\r\n77,506, showing an increase of 2% in the decade. Estimated gross\r\nrevenue, £30,100. The military force numbers 280 men; and there is no\r\ntribute. The town Maler Kotla is 30 m. S. of Ludhiana; pop. (1901),\r\n21,122. The nawab or chief is of Afghan descent; his family originally\r\ncame from Kabul, and occupied positions of trust in Sirhind under the\r\nMogul emperors. They gradually became independent as the Mogul Empire\r\nsank into decay in the course of the 18th century. In General Lake's\r\ncampaign against Holkar in 1805 the nawab of Maler Kotla sided with the\r\nBritish. After the subjugation and flight of Holkar, the English\r\ngovernment succeeded to the power of the Mahrattas in the districts\r\nbetween the Sutlej and the Jumna; and in 1809 its protection was\r\nformally extended to Maler Kotla, as to the other Cis-Sutlej states,\r\nagainst the formidable encroachments of Ranjit Singh. In the campaigns\r\nof 1806, 1807 and 1808 Ranjit Singh had made considerable conquests\r\nacross the Sutlej; in 1808 he marched on Maler Kotla and demanded a\r\nransom of £10,000 from the nawab. This led to the interference of the\r\nBritish, who addressed an ultimatum to Ranjit Singh, declaring the\r\nCis-Sutlej states to be under British protection. Finally the raja of\r\nLahore submitted, and the nawab was reinstated in February 1809. Owing\r\nto the mental incapacity of nawab Ibrahim Ali Khan, the state was\r\nadministered in recent years for some time by the chief of Loharu; but\r\nhis son, Ahmed Ali Khan, was made regent in February 1905.\r\n\r\n  See _Maler Kotla State Gazetteer_ (Lahore, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALESHERBES, CHRÉTIEN GUILLAUME DE LAMOIGNON DE (1721-1794), commonly\r\nknown as Lamoignon-Malesherbes, French statesman, minister, and\r\nafterwards counsel for the defence of Louis XVI., came of a famous legal\r\nfamily. He was born at Paris on the 6th of December 1721, and was\r\neducated for the legal profession. The young lawyer soon proved his\r\nintellectual capacity, when he was appointed president of the _cour des\r\naides_ in the parlement of Paris in 1750 on the promotion of his father,\r\nGuillaume de Lamoignon, to be chancellor. One of the chancellor's duties\r\nwas to control the press, and this duty was entrusted to Malesherbes by\r\nhis father during his eighteen years of office, and brought him into\r\nconnexion with the public far more than his judicial functions. To carry\r\nit out efficiently he kept in communication with the literary leaders of\r\nParis, and especially with Diderot, and Grimm even goes so far as to say\r\nthat \"without the assistance of Malesherbes the _Encyclopédie_ would\r\nprobably never have been published.\" In 1771 he was called upon to mix\r\nin politics; the parlements of France had been dissolved, and a new\r\nmethod of administering justice devised by Maupeou, which was in itself\r\ncommendable as tending to the better and quicker administration of\r\njustice, but pernicious as exhibiting a tendency to over-centralization,\r\nand as abolishing the hereditary \"nobility of the robe,\" which, with all\r\nits faults, had from its nature preserved some independence, and been a\r\ncheck on the royal power. Malesherbes presented a strong remonstrance\r\nagainst the new system, and was at once banished to his country seat at\r\nSt Lucie, to be recalled, however, with the old parlement on the\r\naccession of Louis XVI., and to be made minister of the _maison du roi_\r\nin 1775. He only held office nine months, during which, however, he\r\ndirected his attention to the police of the kingdom, which came under\r\nhis department, and did much to check the odious practice of issuing\r\n_lettres de cachet_. The protest of the _cour des aides_ in 1775 is one\r\nof the most important documents of the old régime in France. It gives a\r\ncomplete survey of the corrupt and inefficient administration, and\r\npresented the king with most outspoken criticism. On retiring from the\r\nministry with Turgot in 1776, he betook himself entirely to a happy\r\ncountry and domestic life and travelled through Switzerland, Germany and\r\nHolland. An essay on Protestant marriages (1787) did much to procure for\r\nthem the civil recognition in France. He had always been an enthusiastic\r\nbotanist; his avenue at St Lucie was world famous; he had written\r\nagainst Buffon on behalf of the botanists whom Buffon had attacked, and\r\nhad been elected a member of the _Académie des sciences_ as far back as\r\n1750. He was now elected a member of the _Académie française_, and\r\neverything seemed to promise a quiet and peaceful old age spent in the\r\nbosom of his family and occupied with scientific and literary pursuits,\r\nwhen the king in his difficulties wished for the support of his name,\r\nand summoned him back to the ministry in 1787. Lamoignon-Malesherbes\r\nheld office but a short time, but returned to his country life this time\r\nwith a feeling of insecurity and disquiet, and, as the troubles\r\nincreased, retired to Switzerland. Nevertheless, in December 1792, in\r\nspite of the fair excuse his old age and long retirement would have\r\ngiven him, he voluntarily left his asylum and undertook with Tronchet\r\nand Desèze the defence of the king before the Convention, and it was his\r\npainful task to break the news of his condemnation to the king. After\r\nthis effort he returned once more to the country, but in December 1793\r\nhe was arrested with his daughter, his son-in-law M. de Rosambo, and his\r\ngrandchildren, and on the 23rd of April 1794 he was guillotined, after\r\nhaving seen all whom he loved in the world executed before his eyes for\r\ntheir relationship to him. Malesherbes is one of the sweetest\r\ncharacters of the 18th century; though no man of action, hardly a man of\r\nthe world, by his charity and unfeigned goodness he became one of the\r\nmost popular men in France, and it was an act of truest self-devotion in\r\nhim to sacrifice himself for a king who had done little or nothing for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n  There are in print several scientific works of Malesherbes of varying\r\n  value, of which the most interesting is his _Observations sur Buffon\r\n  et Daubenton_, written when he was very young, and published with a\r\n  notice by Abeille in 1798. There exist also his _Mémoire pour Louis\r\n  XVI._, his _Mémoire sur la liberté de la presse_ (published 1809) and\r\n  extracts from his remonstrances, published as _Oeuvres choisies de\r\n  Malesherbes_ in 1809. For his life should be read the _Notice\r\n  historique_ (3rd ed., 1806) of Dubois, the _Éloge historique_ (1805)\r\n  of Gaillard, and the interesting _Essai sur la vie, les écrits et les\r\n  opinions de M. de Malesherbes_ (in 2 vols., 1818), of F. A. de Boissy\r\n  d'Anglas. There are also many éloges on him in print, of which the\r\n  best-known is that of M. Dupin, which was delivered at the Academy in\r\n  1841, and was reviewed with much light on Malesherbes's control of the\r\n  press by Sainte-Beuve in the 2nd volume of the _Causeries du lundi_.\r\n  The protest of the _cour des aides_ has been published with\r\n  translation by G. Robinson in the _Translations and Reprints of the\r\n  University of Pennsylvania_ (1900). For his defence of Louis XVI. see\r\n  Marquis de Beaucourt, _Captivité et derniers moments de Louis XVI._ (2\r\n  vols., 1892, Soc. d'hist. contemp.), and A.

(1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALET, LUCAS, the pen-name of Mary St Leger Harrison (1852-   ), English\r\nnovelist. She was the eldest daughter of Charles Kingsley, and was born\r\nat Eversley on the 4th of June 1852. She studied at the Slade school and\r\nat University College, London, and married in 1876 William Harrison,\r\nrector of Clovelly. After her husband's death in 1897 she eventually\r\nsettled in London. She had already written several books--_Mrs Lorimer_\r\n(1882), _Colonel Enderby's Wife_ (1885), _Little Peter_ (1887), _A\r\nCounsel of Perfection_ (1888)--when she published her powerful story,\r\n_The Wages of Sin_ (1891), which attracted great attention. Her _History\r\nof Sir Richard Calmady_ (1901) had an even greater success. Her other\r\nnovels include _The Carissima_ (1896), _The Gateless Barrier_ (1900),\r\n_On the Far Horizon_ (1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALHERBE, FRANÇOIS DE (1555-1628), French poet, critic and translator,\r\nwas born at Caen in 1555. His family was of some position, though it\r\nseems not to have been able to establish to the satisfaction of heralds\r\nthe claims which it made to nobility older than the 16th century. The\r\npoet was the eldest son of another François de Malherbe, _conseiller du\r\nroi_ in the magistracy of Caen. He himself was elaborately educated at\r\nCaen, at Paris, at Heidelberg and at Basel. At the age of twenty-one,\r\npreferring arms to the gown, he entered the household of Henri\r\nd'Angoulême, grand prior of France, the natural son of Henry II. He\r\nserved this prince as secretary in Provence, and married there in 1581.\r\nIt seems that he wrote verses at this period, but, to judge from a\r\nquotation of Tallemant des Réaux, they must have been very bad ones. His\r\npatron died when Malherbe was on a visit in his native province, and for\r\na time he had no particular employment, though by some servile verses he\r\nobtained a considerable gift of money from Henry III., whom he\r\nafterwards libelled. He lived partly in Provence and partly in Normandy\r\nfor many years after this event; but very little is known of his life\r\nduring this period. His _Larmes de Saint Pierre_, imitated from Luigi\r\nTansillo, appeared in 1587.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year parting the two centuries (1600) that he presented to\r\nMarie de' Medici an ode of welcome, the first of his remarkable poems.\r\nBut four or five years more passed before his fortune, which had\r\nhitherto been indifferent, turned. He was presented by his countryman,\r\nthe Cardinal Du Perron, to Henry IV.; and, though that economical prince\r\ndid not at first show any great eagerness to entertain the poet, he was\r\nat last summoned to court and endowed after one fashion or another. It\r\nis said that the pension promised him was not paid till the next reign.\r\nHis father died in 1606, and he came into his inheritance. From this\r\ntime forward he lived at court, corresponding affectionately with his\r\nwife, but seeing her only twice in some twenty years. His old age was\r\nsaddened by a great misfortune. His son, Marc Antoine, a young man of\r\npromise, fell in a duel in 1626. His father used his utmost influence\r\nto have the guilty parties (for more than one were concerned, and there\r\nare grounds for thinking that it was not a fair duel) brought to\r\njustice. But he died before the suit was decided (it is said in\r\nconsequence of disease caught at the camp of La Rochelle, whither he had\r\ngone to petition the king), in Paris, on the 16th of October, 1628, at\r\nthe age of seventy-three.\r\n\r\nThe personal character of Malherbe was far from amiable, but he\r\nexercised, or at least indicated the exercise of, a great and enduring\r\neffect upon French literature, though by no means a wholly beneficial\r\none. The lines of Boileau beginning _Enfin Malherbe vint_ are rendered\r\nonly partially applicable by the extraordinary ignorance of older French\r\npoetry which distinguished that peremptory critic. But the good as well\r\nas bad side of Malherbe's theory and practice is excellently described\r\nby his contemporary and superior Regnier, who was animated against him,\r\nnot merely by reason of his own devotion to Ronsard but because of\r\nMalherbe's discourtesy towards Regnier's uncle P. Desportes, whom the\r\nNorman poet had at first distinctly copied. These are the lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"Cependant leur savoir ne s'étend nullement\r\n   Qu'à régratter un mot douteuse au jugement,\r\n   Prendre garde qu'un _qui_ ne heurte une diphthongue,\r\n   Epier si des vers la rime est brève ou longue,\r\n   Ou bien si la voyelle à l'autre s'unissant\r\n   Ne rend point à l'oreille un vers trop languissant.\r\n       .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\r\n   C'est proser de la rime et rimer de la prose.\"\r\n\r\nThis is perfectly true, and from the time of Malherbe dates that great\r\nand deplorable falling off of French poetry in its more poetic\r\nqualities, which was not made good till 1830. Nevertheless the critical\r\nand restraining tendency of Malherbe was not ill in place after the\r\nluxuriant importation and innovation of the _Pléiade_; and if he had\r\nconfined himself to preaching greater technical perfection, and\r\nespecially greater simplicity and purity in vocabulary and\r\nversification, instead of superciliously striking his pen through the\r\ngreat works of his predecessors, he would have deserved wholly well. As\r\nit was, his reforms helped to elaborate the kind of verse necessary for\r\nthe classical tragedy, and that is the most that can be said for him.\r\nHis own poetical work is scanty in amount, and for the most part frigid\r\nand devoid of inspiration. The beautiful _Consolation à Duperier_, in\r\nwhich occurs the famous line--\r\n\r\n  Et, rose, elle a vécu ce que vivent les roses--\r\n\r\nthe odes to Marie de' Medici and to Louis XIII., and a few other pieces\r\ncomprise all that is really worth remembering of him. His prose work is\r\nmuch more abundant, not less remarkable for care as to style and\r\nexpression, and of greater positive value. It consists of some\r\ntranslations of Livy and Seneca, and of a very large number of\r\ninteresting and admirably written letters, many of which are addressed\r\nto Peiresc, the man of science of whom Gassendi has left a delightful\r\nLatin life. It contains also a most curious commentary on Desportes, in\r\nwhich Malherbe's minute and carping style of verbal criticism is\r\ndisplayed on the great scale.\r\n\r\n  The chief authorities for the biography of Malherbe are the _Vie de\r\n  Malherbe_ by his friend and pupil Racan, and the long _Historiette_\r\n  which Tallemant des Réaux has devoted to him. The standard edition is\r\n  the admirable one of Ludovic Lalanne (5 vols., Paris, 1862-1869). Of\r\n  the poems only, there is an excellent and handsome little issue in the\r\n  _Nouvelle collection Jannet_ (Paris, 1874). Of modern works devoted to\r\n  him, _La Doctrine de Malherbe_, by G. Brunot (1891), is not only the\r\n  most important but a work altogether capital in regard to the study of\r\n  French language and literature. Others are A. Gasté, _La Jeunesse de\r\n  Malherbe_ (1890); V. Bourrienne, _Points obscurs dans la vie normande\r\n  de Malherbe_ (1895); and the duc de Broglie's \"Malherbe\" in _Les\r\n  Grands écrivains français_. On his position in French and general\r\n  critical history, G. Saintsbury's _History of Criticism_, vol. ii.,\r\n  may be consulted.     (G. Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIBRAN, MARIE FÉLICITÉ (1808-1836), operatic singer, daughter of\r\nManoel Garcia, was born in Paris on the 24th of March 1808. Her father\r\nwas then a member of the company of the Théâtre des Italiens, and she\r\naccompanied him to Italy and London. She possessed a soprano voice of\r\nunusual beauty and phenomenal compass, which was carefully cultivated\r\nby her father. She was only seventeen when, in consequence of an\r\nindisposition of Madame Pasta, she was suddenly asked to take her place\r\nin _The Barber of Seville_ at Covent Garden. She was forthwith engaged\r\nfor the remaining six weeks of the season, and then followed her father\r\nto New York, where she appeared in _Othello_, _The Barber of Seville_,\r\n_Don Juan_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _Tancred_. Her gifts as an actress were\r\non a par with her magnificent voice, and her gaiety made her\r\nirresistible in light opera, although her great triumphs were obtained\r\nchiefly in tragic parts. She married a French banker of New York, named\r\nMalibran, who was much older than herself. The marriage was an unhappy\r\none, and Mme Malibran returned alone to Europe in 1828, when she began\r\nthe series of representations at the Théâtre des Italiens, which excited\r\nan enthusiasm in Paris only exceeded by the reception she received in\r\nthe principal towns of Italy. She was formally divorced from Malibran in\r\n1835, and married the Belgian violinist, Charles de Beriot; but she died\r\nof fever on the 23rd of September 1836.\r\n\r\n  See _Memoirs of Mme Malibran by the comtesse de Merlin and other\r\n  intimate friends, with a selection from her correspondence_ (2 vols.,\r\n  1840); and M.

The acid potassium\r\nsalt is also found in the leaves and stalks of rhubarb. Since the acid\r\ncontains an asymmetric carbon atom, it can exist in three forms, a\r\ndextro-rotatory, a laevo-rotatory and an inactive form; the acid\r\nobtained in the various synthetical processes is the inactive form. It\r\nmay be prepared by heating racemic acid (see TARTARIC ACID) with fuming\r\nhydriodic acid; by heating fumaric acid (q.v.) with water at 150-200°\r\nC.; by the action of nitrous acid on inactive aspartic acid; and by the\r\naction of moist silver oxide on monobromsuccinic acid. It forms\r\ndeliquescent crystals, which are readily soluble in alcohol and melt at\r\n100° C. When heated for some time at 130° C. it yields fumaric acid\r\n(q.v.), and on rapid heating at 180° C. gives maleic anhydride and\r\nfumaric acid. It yields coumarins when warmed with sulphuric acid and\r\nphenols (H. v. Pechmann, _Ber._, 1884, 17, 929, 1649 et seq.). Potassium\r\nbichromate oxidizes it to malonic acid; nitric acid oxidizes it to\r\noxalic acid; and hydriodic acid reduces it to succinic acid. The\r\ninactive variety may be split into the component active forms by means\r\nof its cinchonine salt (G. J. W. Bremer, _Ber._, 1880, 13, 352).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIGNANT (Lat. _malignus_, evil-disposed, from _maligenus_), wicked, of\r\na malicious or wilfully evil disposition. The word was early applied by\r\nthe Protestants to the Romanists, with an allusion to the \"congregation\r\nof evil doers\" (Vulgate _Ecclesiam malignantium_) of Psalm xxvi. 5. In\r\nEnglish history, during the Great Rebellion, the name was given to the\r\nRoyalists by the Parliamentary party. In the Great Remonstrance of 1641\r\noccur the words \"the malignant partie, wherof the Archbishop (Laud) and\r\nthe earl of Strafford being heads.\" The name throughout the period had\r\nspecial reference to the religious differences between the parties. In\r\nmedical science, the term \"malignant\" is applied to a particularly\r\nvirulent or dangerous form which a disease may take, or to a tumour or\r\ngrowth of rapid growth, extension to the lymphatic glands, and\r\nrecurrence after operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIK IBN ANAS (c. 718-795), the founder of the Malikite school of canon\r\nlaw, was born at Medina about A.D. 718: the precise date is not certain.\r\nHe studied and passed his life there, and came to be regarded as the\r\ngreatest local authority in theology and law. (For his legal system and\r\nits history see MAHOMMEDAN LAW.) His life was one of extreme honour and\r\ndignity, but uneventful, being given to study, lecturing on law and\r\nacting as mufti and judge. Only two episodes stand out in his biography.\r\nWhen Mahommed ibn 'Abdallah, the 'Alid, rose in A.D. 762 at Medina\r\nagainst the 'Abbasids, Malik gave a _fatwa_, or legal opinion, that the\r\noath of allegiance to the 'Abbasids was invalid, as extorted by force.\r\nFor this independence he was severely scourged by the 'Abbasid governor,\r\nwho, apparently, did not dare to go beyond scourging with a man of his\r\nstanding with the people. The second episode gave equal proof of\r\nindependence. In 795 Harun al-Rashid made the pilgrimage, came with two\r\nof his sons to Medina, and sat at the feet of Malik as he lectured in\r\nthe mosque. The story, legendary or historical, adds that Malik had\r\nrefused to go to the caliph, saying that it was for the student to come\r\nto his teacher. Late in life he seems to have turned to asceticism and\r\ncontemplation. It is said that he retired from all active, public life\r\nand even neglected plain, public duties, replying to reproaches, \"Not\r\nevery one can speak in his own excuse\" (Ibn Qutaiba, _Ma 'arif_, 250).\r\nHe is also entered among the early ascetic Sufis (cf. _Fihrist_, 183).\r\nHe died in Medina, A.D. 795.\r\n\r\n  For a description of his principal book, the _Muwatta'_, see\r\n  Goldziher's _Muhammedanische Studien_, ii. 213 sqq. He wrote also a\r\n  Koran commentary, now apparently lost, and a hortatory epistle to\r\n  Harun al-Rashid. See further, de Slane's trans. of Ibn Khallikan, ii.\r\n  545 sqq.; von Kremer, _Culturgeschichte_, i. 477 sqq.; Brockelmann,\r\n  _Gesch. der arab.

Ma.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALINES (Flemish, _Mechelen_, called in the middle ages by the Latin\r\nname Mechlinia, whence the spelling Mechlin), an ancient and important\r\ncity of Belgium, and the seat since 1559 of the only archbishopric in\r\nthat country. Pop. (1904), 58,101. The name is supposed to be derived\r\nfrom _maris linea_, and to indicate that originally the sea came up to\r\nit. It is now situated on the Dyle, and is in the province of Antwerp,\r\nlying about half-way between Antwerp and Brussels. The chief importance\r\nof Malines is derived from the fact that it is in a sense the religious\r\ncapital of Belgium--the archbishop being the primate of the Catholic\r\nChurch in that country. The archbishop's palace is in a picturesque\r\nsituation, and dates from the creation of the dignity. The principal\r\nbuilding in the city is the exceedingly fine cathedral dedicated to St\r\nRombaut. This cathedral was begun in the 12th and finished early in the\r\n14th century, and although modified in the 15th after a fire, it remains\r\none of the most remarkable specimens of Gothic architecture in Europe.\r\nThe massive tower of over 300 ft., which is described as unfinished\r\nbecause the original intention was to carry it to 500 ft., is its most\r\nstriking external feature. The people of Malines gained in the old\r\ndistich--\"gaudet Mechlinia stultis\"--the reputation of being \"fools,\"\r\nbecause one of the citizens on seeing the moon through the dormer\r\nwindows of St Rombaut called out that the place was on fire, and his\r\nfellow-citizens, following his example, endeavoured to put out the\r\nconflagration until they realized the truth. The cathedral contains a\r\nfine altar-piece by Van Dyck, and the pulpit is in carved oak of the\r\n17th century. Another old palace is that of Margaret of Austria, regent\r\nfor Charles V., which has been carefully preserved and is now used as a\r\ncourt of justice. In the church of Notre Dame (16th century) is Rubens'\r\nmasterpiece \"the miraculous draught of fishes,\" and in that of St John\r\nis a fine triptych by the same master. Malines, although no longer\r\nfamous for its lace, carries on a large trade in linen, needles,\r\nfurniture and oil, while as a junction for the line from Ghent to\r\nLouvain and Liège, as well as for that from Antwerp to Brussels and the\r\nsouth, its station is one of the busiest in Belgium, and this fact has\r\ncontributed to the general prosperity of the city.\r\n\r\nThe lordship of Malines was conferred as a separate fief by Pippin the\r\nShort on his kinsman Count Adon in 754. In the 9th century Charles the\r\nBald bestowed the fief on the bishop of Liége, and after being shared\r\nbetween Brabant and Flanders it passed into the hands of Philip the\r\nBold, founder of the house of Burgundy, in 1384. During the religious\r\ntroubles of the 16th century Malines suffered greatly, and in 1572 it\r\nwas sacked by Alva's troops during three days. In the wars of the 17th\r\nand 18th centuries it was besieged many times and captured by the\r\nFrench, Dutch and English on several occasions. The French finally\r\nremoved the fortifications in 1804, since which year it has been an open\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLANWAN, a town in Hardoi district, the United Provinces, India. Pop.\r\n(1901), 11,158. Under native rule the town possessed considerable\r\npolitical importance, and upon the British annexation of Oudh it was\r\nselected as the headquarters of the district, but was abandoned in\r\nfavour of Hardoi after the Mutiny. Saltpetre and brass utensils are\r\nmanufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLARMÉ, FRANÇOIS RENÉ AUGUSTE (1755-1835), French Revolutionist, the\r\nson of a lawyer, was born at Nancy on the 25th of February 1755. He was\r\nbrought up in his father's profession, and was appointed\r\n_procureur-syndic_ of the district of Pont-à-Mousson. During the\r\nRevolution he was elected by the department of Meurthe deputy to the\r\nLegislative Assembly and the Convention, where he attached himself to\r\nthe Mountain and voted for the death of Louis XVI. He was elected\r\npresident of the Convention on the 30th of May 1793, and by his weakness\r\nduring the crisis of the following day contributed much to the success\r\nof the insurrection against the Girondists. He took an active part in\r\nthe _levée-en-masse_, and in November 1793 was given the task of\r\nestablishing the revolutionary government in the departments of Meuse\r\nand Moselle, where he gained an unenviable notoriety by ordering the\r\nexecution of the sentence of death decreed by the revolutionary tribunal\r\non some young girls at Verdun who had offered flowers to the Prussians\r\nwhen they entered the town. After the fall of Robespierre he joined the\r\ngroup of \"Thermidorians\" and was sent on mission to the south of France,\r\nwhere he closed the Jacobin club at Toulouse and set free a number of\r\nimprisoned \"suspects.\" On the 1st of June 1795 he was denounced and\r\narrested, but was soon set at liberty. In 1796 he was appointed by the\r\nDirectory commissioner for the organization of the departments of Dyle\r\nand Mont-Tonnerre. Under the empire he was receiver of the _droits\r\nréunis_ at Nancy, and lost his money in 1814 in raising a levy of\r\nvolunteers. Appointed sub-prefect of Avesnes during the Hundred Days, he\r\nwas imprisoned by the Prussians in revenge for the death of the maidens\r\nof Verdun, and lived in exile during the Restoration. He returned to\r\nFrance after the revolution of 1830, and died at Richemont\r\n(Seine-Inférieure) on the 25th of July 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLARMÉ, STÉPHANE (1842-1898), French poet and theorist, was born at\r\nParis, on the 18th of March 1842. His life was simple and without event.\r\nHis small income as professor of English in a French college was\r\nsufficient for his needs, and, with his wife and daughter, he divided\r\nthe year between a fourth-floor flat in Paris and a cottage on the banks\r\nof the Seine. His Tuesday evening receptions, which did so much to form\r\nthe thought of the more interesting of the younger French men of\r\nletters, were almost as important a part of his career as the few\r\ncarefully elaborated books which he produced at long intervals.\r\n_L'Après-midi d'un faune_ (1876) and other fragments of his verse and\r\nprose had been known to a few people long before the publication of the\r\n_Poésies complètes_ of 1887, in a facsimile of his clear and elegant\r\nhandwriting, and of the Pages of 1891 and the _Vers et prose_ of 1893.\r\nHis remarkable translation of poems of Poe appeared in 1888, \"The Raven\"\r\nhaving been published as early as 1875, with illustrations by Manet.\r\n_Divagations_, his own final edition of his prose, was published in\r\n1897, and a more or less complete edition of the _Poésies_,\r\nposthumously, in 1899. He died at Valvins, Fontainebleau, on the 9th of\r\nSeptember 1898. All his life Mallarmé was in search of a new aesthetics,\r\nand his discoveries by the way were often admirable. But he was too\r\ncritical ever to create freely, and too limited ever to create\r\nabundantly. His great achievement remains unfinished, and all that he\r\nleft towards it is not of equal value. There are a few poems and a few\r\npieces of imaginative prose which have the haunting quality of Gustave\r\nMoreau's pictures, with the same jewelled magnificence, mysterious and\r\nyet definite. His later work became more and more obscure, as he seemed\r\nto himself to have abolished limit after limit which holds back speech\r\nfrom the expression of the absolute. Finally, he abandoned punctuation\r\nin verse, and invented a new punctuation, along with a new construction,\r\nfor prose. Patience in the study of so difficult an author has its\r\nreward. No one in our time has vindicated with more pride the\r\nself-sufficiency of the artist in his struggle with the material world.\r\nTo those who knew him only by his writings his conversation was\r\nstartling in its clearness; it was always, like all his work, at the\r\nservice of a few dignified and misunderstood ideas.\r\n\r\n  See also Paul Verlaine, _Les Poètes maudits_ (1884); J. Lemaître, _Les\r\n  Contemporains_ (5th series, 1891); Albert Moekel, _Stéphane Mallarmé,\r\n  un héros_ (1899); E. W. Gosse, _French Profiles_ (1905) and A. Symons,\r\n  _The Symbolist Movement in Literature_ (1900). A complete bibliography\r\n  is given in the _Poètes d'aujourd'hui_ (1880-1900, 11th ed., 1905) of\r\n  MM. A. van Bever and P. Léautaud.     (A. Sy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLECO, a province of southern Chile, once a part of the Indian\r\nterritory of Araucania (q.v.), lying between the provinces of Bio-Bio on\r\nthe N. and E., Cautin on the S. and Arauco on the W. Area, 2973 sq. m.\r\nPop. (1895), 98,032. It belongs to the rainy, forested region of\r\nsouthern Chile, and is thinly populated, a considerable part of its\r\npopulation being Araucanian Indians, who occupy districts in the Andean\r\nfoothills. Gold placer mining has attracted some attention, but the\r\noutput is small. The principal industries are cattle and wheat raising\r\nand timber-cutting. The capital is Angol (pop., 7056 in 1895; estimated\r\nat 7638 in 1902), a small town in the northern part of the province, on\r\nthe Malleco river, and a station on the Traiguen branch of the state\r\nrailway. Traiguen (pop., 5732 in 1895; estimated at 7099 in 1902) in the\r\nsouthern part of the province is the second town in importance, and\r\nVictoria (pop., 6989 in 1895; estimated at 10,002 in 1902), about 20 m.\r\nE. of the last-named town, was for a time the terminal station of the\r\nmain line of the railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLEMUCK, from the German rendering of the Dutch _Mallemugge_ (which\r\noriginally meant small flies or midges that madly whirl round a light),\r\na name given by the early Dutch Arctic voyagers to the Fulmar (q.v.), of\r\nwhich the English form is nowadays most commonly applied by our sailors\r\nto the smaller albatrosses, of about the size of a goose, met with in\r\nthe Southern Ocean--corrupted into \"molly mawk,\" or \"mollymauk.\" A\r\nnumber of species have been identified. _Diomedea irrorata_ of West Peru\r\nis sooty-brown with white mottlings and a white head; _D. migripes_ of\r\nthe North Pacific is similar in colour but with white only near the eye\r\nand at the base of the tail and bill; _D. immutabilis_ of Japan is\r\ndarker but has a white head. _D. melanophrys_ of the southern oceans has\r\nbeen found in summer both in California, in England, and as far north as\r\nthe Faeroes. According to J. Gould the latter is the commonest species\r\nof albatross inhabiting the Southern Ocean, and its gregarious habits\r\nand familiar disposition make it well known to every voyager to or from\r\nAustralia, for it is equally common in the Atlantic as well as the\r\nPacific. The back, wings and tail are of a blackish-grey, but all the\r\nrest of the plumage is white, except a dusky superciliary streak, whence\r\nits name of black-browed albatross, as also its scientific epithet, are\r\ntaken. The bill of the adult is of an ochreous-yellow, while that of the\r\nyoung is dark. This species breeds on the Falkland Islands. _D. bulleri_\r\nof the New Zealand seas is greyish-brown, with white underparts and rump\r\nand ashy head. _Diomedea_ (or _Thalassogeron_) _culminata_ and\r\n_chlororhyncha_ of the southern seas, _D._ (or _T._) _cauta_ of\r\nTasmania, _salvini_ of New Zealand and _layardi_ of the Cape resemble\r\n_D. bulleri_, but have a strip of naked skin between the plates of the\r\nmaxilla towards its base. H. N. Moseley (_Notes of a Naturalist_, 130)\r\ndescribes _D. culminata_ as making a cylindrical nest of grass, sedge\r\nand clay, with a shallow basin atop and an overhanging rim--the whole\r\nbeing about 14 in. in diameter and 10 in height. The bird lays a single\r\nwhite egg, which is held in a sort of pouch, formed by the skin of the\r\nabdomen, while she is incubating. The feet of _D. bulleri_ are red, of\r\n_D. chlororhyncha_ flesh-coloured, of the others yellow.     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLESON, GEORGE BRUCE (1825-1898), Indian officer and author, was born\r\nat Wimbledon, on the 8th of May 1825. Educated at Winchester, he\r\nobtained a cadetship in the Bengal infantry in 1842, and served through\r\nthe second Burmese War. His subsequent appointments were in the civil\r\nline, the last being that of guardian to the young maharaja of Mysore.\r\nHe retired with the rank of colonel in 1877, having been created C.S.I.\r\nin 1872. He died at Kensington, on the 1st of March 1898. He was a\r\nvoluminous writer, his first work to attract attention being the famous\r\n\"Red Pamphlet,\" published at Calcutta in 1857, when the Mutiny was at\r\nits height. He continued, and considerably rewrote the _History of the\r\nIndian Mutiny_ (6 vols., 1878-1880), which was begun but left unfinished\r\nby Sir John Kaye. Among his other books the most valuable are _History\r\nof the French in India_ (2nd ed., 1893) and _The Decisive Battles of\r\nIndia_ (3rd ed., 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLET (or MALLOCH), DAVID (?1705-1765), Scottish poet and dramatist,\r\nthe son of a Perthshire farmer, was born in that county, probably in\r\n1705. In 1717 he went to the high school at Edinburgh, and some three\r\nyears later to the university, where he made the friendship of James\r\nThomson, author of _The Seasons_. As early as 1720 he began to publish\r\nshort poems in the manner of the period, a number of which appeared\r\nduring the next few years in collections such as the _Edinburgh\r\nMiscellany_ and Allan Ramsay's _Tea Table Miscellany_, in which his\r\nballad \"William and Margaret\" was published in 1724. For some years from\r\n1723 he was private tutor to the duke of Montrose's sons, with whom he\r\ntravelled on the Continent in 1727. His real name was Malloch; but this\r\nhe changed to Mallet in 1724. In 1735 he took the M.A. degree at Oxford.\r\nHe had already made the friendship of Pope, whose vanity he flattered in\r\na poem on _Verbal Criticism_, in 1733; and through Pope he became\r\nacquainted with Bolingbroke and other Tory politicians, especially those\r\nattached to the party of the prince of Wales, who in 1742 appointed\r\nMallet to be his paid secretary. After Pope's death, in 1744, Mallet, at\r\nthe instigation of Bolingbroke and forgetful of past favours and\r\nfriendship, vilified the poet's memory, thereby incurring the resentment\r\nof Pope's friends. For his services as a party pamphleteer, in which\r\ncharacter he published an attack on Admiral Byng, Mallet received from\r\nLord Bute a lucrative sinecure in 1760. He died on the 21st of April\r\n1765. Mallet was a small man, in his younger days something of a dandy\r\nand inordinately vain. He was twice married; by his first wife he had a\r\ndaughter, Dorothy, who married Pietro Paolo Celesia, a Genoese\r\ngentleman, and was the author of several poems and plays, notably\r\n_Almida_, produced by Garrick at Drury Lane in 1771.\r\n\r\nMallet's own works included several plays, some of which were produced\r\nby Garrick, who was Mallet's personal friend. _Eurydice_, a tragedy,\r\nwith prologue and epilogue by Aaron Hill, was produced at Drury Lane in\r\n1731; _Mustapha_, also a tragedy, had considerable success at the same\r\ntheatre in 1739; in 1740, in collaboration with Thomson, he produced the\r\nmasque _Alfred_, of which he published a new version in 1751, after\r\nThomson's death, claiming it to be almost entirely his own work. This\r\nmasque is notable as containing the well-known patriotic song, \"Rule\r\nBritannia,\" the authorship of which has been attributed to Mallet,\r\nalthough he allowed it to appear without protest in his lifetime with\r\nThomson's name attached. His other writings include _Poems on Several\r\nOccasions_ (1743); _Amyntor and Theodora, or the Hermit_ (1747); another\r\nvolume of _Poems_ (1762).\r\n\r\n  In 1759 a collected edition of Mallet's _Works_ was published in three\r\n  volumes; and in 1857 his _Ballads and Songs_ were edited by F.\r\n  Dinsdale with notes, and a biographical memoir of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLET, PAUL HENRI (1730-1807), Swiss writer, was born on the 20th of\r\nAugust 1730, in Geneva. After having been educated there, he became\r\ntutor in the family of the count of Calenberg in Saxony. In 1752 he was\r\nappointed professor of _belles lettres_ to the academy at Copenhagen. He\r\nwas naturally attracted to the study of the ancient literature and\r\nhistory of his adopted country, and in 1755 he published the first\r\nfruits of his researches, under the title _Introduction à l'histoire du\r\nDanemarck où l'on traite de la religion, des moeurs, des lois, et des\r\nusages des anciens Danois_. A second part, more particularly relating to\r\nthe ancient literature of the country, _Monuments de la mythologie et de\r\nla poesie des Celtes, et particulièrement des anciens Scandinaves_, was\r\nissued in 1756, and was also translated into Danish. A translation into\r\nEnglish, with notes and preface, by Bishop Percy, was issued in 1770\r\nunder the title of _Northern Antiquities_ (republished with additions in\r\n1847). The book had a wide circulation, and attracted much attention on\r\naccount of its being the first (though a very defective) translation\r\ninto French of the _Edda_. The king of Denmark showed his appreciation\r\nby choosing Mallet to be preceptor of the crown prince. In 1760 he\r\nreturned to Geneva, and became professor of history in his native city.\r\nWhile there he was requested by the czarina to undertake the education\r\nof the heir-apparent of Russia (afterwards the czar Paul I.), but\r\ndeclined the honour. An invitation more congenial to his tastes led to\r\nhis accompanying Lord Mountstuart in his travels through Italy and\r\nthence to England, where he was presented at court and commissioned to\r\nwrite the history of the house of Brunswick. He had previously received\r\na similar commission from the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel for the\r\npreparation of a history of the house of Hesse, and both works were\r\ncompleted in 1785. The quietude of a literary life was rudely broken by\r\nthe shock of the Revolution, to which he was openly hostile. His\r\nleanings to the unpopular side were so obnoxious to his fellow-citizens\r\nthat he was obliged to quit his native country in 1792, and remained in\r\nexile till 1801. He died at Geneva, on the 8th of February 1807.\r\n\r\n  A memoir of his life and writings, by Sismondi, was published at\r\n  Geneva in 1807. Besides the _Introduction to the History of Denmark_,\r\n  his principal works are: _Histoire du Danemarck_ (3 vols., Copenhagen,\r\n  1758-1777); _Histoire de la maison de Hesse_ (4 vols., 1767-1785);\r\n  _Histoire de la maison de Brunswick_ (4 vols., 1767-1785); _Histoire\r\n  de la maison et des états du Mecklenbourg_ (1796); _Histoire des\r\n  Suisses ou Helvétiens_ (4 vols., Geneva, 1803) (mainly an abridgment\r\n  of J. von Müller's great history); _Histoire de la ligue hanséatique_\r\n  (1805).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLET, ROBERT (1810-1881), Irish engineer, physicist and geologist, was\r\nborn in Dublin, on the 3rd of June 1810. He was educated at Trinity\r\nCollege in that city, and graduated B.A. in 1830. Trained as an\r\nengineer, he was elected M.Inst.C.E. in 1842; he built in 1848-1849 the\r\nFastnet Rock lighthouse, south-west of Cape Clear, and was engaged in\r\nother important works. Devoting much attention to pure science, he\r\nbecame especially distinguished for his researches on earthquakes, and\r\nfrom 1852-1858 he was engaged (with his son John William Mallet) in the\r\npreparation of his great work, _The Earthquake Catalogue of the British\r\nAssociation_ (1858). In 1862 he published two volumes, dealing with the\r\n_Great Neapolitan Earthquake of 1857_ and _The First Principles of\r\nObservational Seismology_. He then brought forward evidence to show that\r\nthe depth below the earth's surface, whence came the impulse of the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake, was about 8 or 9 geographical miles. One of his\r\nmost important essays was that communicated to the Royal Society (_Phil.\r\nTrans._ clxiii. 147; 1874), entitled _Volcanic Energy: an Attempt to\r\ndevelop its True Origin and Cosmical Relations_. He sought to show that\r\nvolcanic heat may be attributed to the effects of crushing, contortion\r\nand other disturbances in the crust of the earth; the disturbances\r\nleading to the formation of lines of fracture, more or less vertical,\r\ndown which water would find its way, and if the temperature generated be\r\nsufficient volcanic eruptions of steam or lava would follow. He was\r\nelected F.R.S. in 1854, and he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the\r\nGeological Society of London in 1877. He died at Clapham, London, on the\r\n5th of November 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLET DU PAN, JACQUES (1749-1800), French journalist, of an old\r\nHuguenot family, was born near Geneva in 1749, the son of a Protestant\r\nminister. He was educated at Geneva, and through the influence of\r\nVoltaire obtained a professorship at Cassel. He soon, however, resigned\r\nthis post, and going to London joined H.S.N. Linguet in the production\r\nof his _Annales politiques_ (1778-1780). During Linguet's imprisonment\r\nin the Bastille Mallet du Pan continued the _Annales_ by himself\r\n(1781-1783); but Linguet resented this on his release, and Mallet du Pan\r\nchanged the title of his own publication to _Mémoires historiques_\r\n(1783). From 1783 he incorporated this work with the _Mercure de France_\r\nin Paris, the political direction of which had been placed in his hands.\r\nOn the outbreak of the French Revolution he sided with the Royalists,\r\nand was sent on a mission (1791-1792) by Louis XVI. to Frankfort to try\r\nand secure the sympathy and intervention of the German princes. From\r\nGermany he travelled to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Brussels in\r\nthe Royalist interest. He published a number of anti-revolutionary\r\npamphlets, and a violent attack on Bonaparte and the Directory resulted\r\nin his being exiled in 1797 to Berne. In 1798 he came to London, where\r\nhe founded the _Mercure britannique_. He died at Richmond, Surrey, on\r\nthe 10th of May 1800, his widow being pensioned by the English\r\ngovernment. Mallet du Pan has a place in history as a pioneer of modern\r\npolitical journalism. His son JOHN LEWIS MALLET (1775-1861) spent a\r\nuseful life in the English civil service, becoming secretary of the\r\nBoard of Audit; and J. L. Mallet's second son, SIR LOUIS MALLET\r\n(1823-1890) also entered the civil service in the Board of Trade and\r\nrose to be a distinguished economist and a member of the Council of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n  Mallet du Pan's _Mémoires et correspondance_ was edited by A. Sayous\r\n  (Paris, 1851). See _Mallet du Pan and the French Revolution_ (1902),\r\n  by Bernard Mallet, son of Sir Louis Mallet, author also of a biography\r\n  of his father (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLING, EAST and WEST, two populous villages in the Medway\r\nparliamentary division of Kent, England, respectively 5 and 6 m. W. by\r\nN. of Maidstone, with a station on the South-Eastern and Chatham\r\nrailway. Pop. (1901), East Malling, 2391; West Malling, 2312. They are\r\nsituated in a rich agricultural district on the western slope of the\r\nvalley of the Medway, and East Malling has large paper mills. At West\r\nMalling are remains of Malling Abbey, a Benedictine nunnery founded in\r\n1090 by Gundulf, bishop of Rochester. The remains, which are partly\r\nincorporated in a modern building, include the Norman west front of the\r\nchurch, the Early English cloisters, the chapter-house, gate-house (the\r\nchapel of which is restored to use), and other portions. About Addington\r\nnear West Malling are considerable prehistoric remains, including\r\nmounds, single stones, stone circles and pits in the chalk hills; while\r\nat Leybourne are the gateway and other fragments of the castle held by\r\nthe Leybourne family from the 12th to the 14th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLOCK, WILLIAM HURRELL (1849-   ), English author, was born at\r\nCockington Court, Devonshire. He was educated privately, and at Balliol\r\nCollege, Oxford. He won the Newdigate prize in 1872, and took a second\r\nclass in the final classical schools in 1874. He attracted considerable\r\nattention by his satirical story _The New Republic_ (2 vols., 1877), in\r\nwhich he introduced characters easily recognized as prominent living\r\nmen, Mark Pattison, Matthew Arnold, W. K. Clifford and others. His keen\r\nlogic and gift for acute exposition and criticism were displayed in\r\nlater years both in fiction and in controversial works. In a series of\r\nbooks dealing with religious questions he insisted on dogma as the basis\r\nof religion and on the impossibility of founding religion on purely\r\nscientific data. In _Is Life Worth Living?_ (1879) and _The New Paul and\r\nVirginia_ (1878) he attacked Positivist theories, and in a volume on the\r\nintellectual position of the Church of England, _Doctrine and Doctrinal\r\nDisruption_ (1900), he advocated the necessity of a strictly defined\r\ncreed. Later volumes on similar topics were _Religion as a Credible\r\nDoctrine_ (1903) and _The Reconstruction of Belief_ (1905). He published\r\nseveral brilliant works on economics, directed against Radical and\r\nSocialist theories: _Social Equality_ (1882), _Property and Progress_\r\n(1884), _Labour and the Popular Welfare_ (1893), _Classes and Masses_\r\n(1896) and _Aristocracy and Evolution_ (1898); and among his\r\nanti-socialist works should be classed his novel, _The Old Order\r\nChanges_ (1886). His other novels include _A Romance of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ (1881), _A Human Document_ (1892), _The Heart of Life_ (1895)\r\nand _The Veil of the Temple_ (1904). He published a volume of _Poems_ in\r\n1880, and in 1900 _Lucretius on Life and Death_ in verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLOW, a market town and watering place of Co. Cork, Ireland, on the\r\nBlackwater, 144½ m. S.W. from Dublin, and 21 N. from Cork by the Great\r\nSouthern and Western railway. Pop. (1901), 4542. It is a junction for\r\nlines westward to Killarney and Co. Kerry, and eastward to Lismore and\r\nCo. Waterford. The town owes its prosperity to its beautiful situation\r\nin a fine valley surrounded by mountains, and possesses a tepid mineral\r\nspring, considered efficacious in cases of general debility and for\r\nscorbutic and consumptive complaints. A spa-house with pump-room and\r\nbaths was erected in 1828. The parish church dates from 1818, but there\r\nare remains of an earlier building adjoining it. There are manufactures\r\nof mineral water and condensed milk, corn-mills and tanneries. Mallow\r\nreceived a charter of incorporation from James I. Its name was\r\noriginally Magh Allo, that is, Plain of the Allo (the old name used by\r\nSpenser for this part of the river), and the ford was defended by a\r\ncastle, built by the Desmonds, the ruins of which remain. A bridge\r\nconnects the town with the suburb of Ballydaheen. Mallow is a centre for\r\nthe fine salmon fishing on the Blackwater. The climate is very mild. The\r\ntown was a parliamentary borough till 1885. It is governed by an urban\r\ndistrict council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLOW, botanically _Malva_, the typical genus of the natural order\r\nMalvaceae, embracing about sixteen species of annual and perennial\r\nherbaceous plants, widely distributed throughout the northern\r\nhemisphere. The mallows possess the reniform one-celled anthers which\r\nspecially characterize the _Malvaceae_ (q.v.). The petals also are\r\nunited by their base to the tube formed by the coalesced filaments of\r\nthe stamens. The special characters which separate the genus _Malva_\r\nfrom others most nearly allied to it are the involucre, consisting of a\r\nrow of three separate bracts attached to the lower part of the true\r\ncalyx, and the numerous single-seeded carpels disposed in a circle\r\naround a central axis, from which they become detached when ripe. The\r\nflowers are mostly white or pinkish, never yellow, the leaves\r\nradiate-veined, and more or less lobed or cut. Three species are natives\r\nof Britain. The musk mallow (_Malva moschata_) is a perennial herb with\r\nfive-partite, deeply-cut leaves, and large rose-coloured flowers\r\nclustered together at the ends of the branched stems, and is found\r\ngrowing along hedges and borders of fields, blossoming in July and\r\nAugust. It owes its name to a slight musky odour diffused by the plant\r\nin warm dry weather when it is kept in a confined situation. The\r\nround-leaved dwarf mallow (_Malva rotundifolia_) is a creeping\r\nperennial, growing in waste sandy places, with roundish serrate leaves\r\nand small pinkish-white flowers produced in the axils of the leaves from\r\nJune to September. It is common throughout Europe and the north of\r\nAfrica, extending to western and northern Asia. The common mallow\r\n(_Malva sylvestris_), the _mauve_ of the French, is an erect biennial or\r\nperennial plant with long-stalked roundish-angular serrate leaves, and\r\nconspicuous axillary reddish-purple flowers, blossoming from May to\r\nSeptember. Like most plants of the order it abounds in mucilage, and\r\nhence forms a favourite domestic remedy for colds and sore throats. The\r\naniline dye called mauve derives its name from its resemblance to the\r\ncolour of this plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Mallow (_Malva sylvestris_), 1/3 nat. size.\r\n\r\n    1. Flower in section.\r\n    2. Stamens showing the union of the filaments into a common tube\r\n         (monadelphous).\r\n    3. Fruit with persistent calyx. 1, 2 and 5 enlarged.\r\n    4.

Seed.]\r\n\r\n  The marsh mallow (_Althaea officinalis_), the _guimauve_ of the\r\n  French, belongs to another genus having an involucre of numerous\r\n  bracts. It is a native of marshy ground near the sea or in the\r\n  neighbourhood of saline springs. It is an erect perennial herb, with\r\n  somewhat woody stems, velvety, ovate, acute, unequally serrate leaves,\r\n  and delicate pink showy flowers blooming from July to September. The\r\n  flowers are said to yield a good deal of honey to bees. The marsh\r\n  mallow is remarkable for containing asparagin, C4H8N2O3, H2O, which,\r\n  if the root be long kept in a damp place, disappears, butyric acid\r\n  being developed. The root also contains about 25% of starch and the\r\n  same quantity of mucilage, which differs from that of gum arabic in\r\n  containing one molecule less of water and in being precipitated by\r\n  neutral acetate of lead. It is used in _pâte de guimauve_ lozenges.\r\n  _Althaea rosea_ is the hollyhock (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  The mallow of Scripture, Job xxx. 4, has been sometimes identified\r\n  with Jew's mallow (_Corchorus olitorius_), a member of the closely\r\n  allied order Tiliaceae, but more plausibly (the word [Hebrew: maluah]\r\n  implying a saline plant) with _Atriplex Halimus_, or sea orache. In\r\n  Syria the _Halimus_ was still known by the name _Malluh_ in the time\r\n  of Ibn Beitar. See Bochart, _Hieroz._ iii. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMEDY, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine Province, lying in a\r\nwild and deep basin, on the Warche, 20 m. S. of Aix-la-Chapelle by rail\r\nvia Eupen. It contains two Roman Catholic churches, a modern town-hall\r\nand a classical school. Its industries include tanning, dyeing and\r\npaper-making. Pop. (1900), 4680. Malmedy was famous for its Benedictine\r\nabbey, founded about 675, which was united with that of Stablo, the\r\nabbot of the joint house being a prince of the empire. In 1802 the lands\r\nof the abbey passed to France, and in 1815 they were divided between\r\nPrussia and Netherlands.\r\n\r\n  See Kellen, _Malmedy und die preussische Wallonie_ (Essen, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMESBURY, JAMES HARRIS, 1ST EARL OF (1746-1820), English diplomatist,\r\nwas born at Salisbury on the 21st of April 1746, being the son of James\r\nHarris (q.v.), the author of _Hermes_. Educated at Winchester, Oxford\r\nand Leiden, young Harris became secretary in 1768 to the British embassy\r\nat Madrid, and was left as _chargé d'affaires_ at that court on the\r\ndeparture of Sir James Grey until the arrival of George Pitt, afterwards\r\nLord Rivers. This interval gave him his opportunity; he discovered the\r\nintention of Spain to attack the Falkland Islands, and was instrumental\r\nin thwarting it by putting on a bold countenance. As a reward he was\r\nappointed minister _ad interim_ at Madrid, and in January 1772 minister\r\nplenipotentiary to the court of Prussia. His success was marked, and in\r\n1777 he was transferred to the court of Russia. At St Petersburg he made\r\nhis reputation, for he managed to get on with Catherine in spite of her\r\npredilections for France, and steered adroitly through the accumulated\r\ndifficulties of the first Armed Neutrality. He was made a knight of the\r\nBath at the end of 1778, but in 1782 he returned home owing to\r\nill-health, and was appointed by his friend Fox to be minister at the\r\nHague, an appointment confirmed after some delay by Pitt (1784). He did\r\nvery great service in furthering Pitt's policy of maintaining England's\r\ninfluence on the Continent by the arms of her allies, and held the\r\nthreads of the diplomacy which ended in the king of Prussia's\r\noverthrowing the republican party in Holland, which was inclined to\r\nFrance, and re-establishing the prince of Orange. In recognition of his\r\nservices he was created Baron Malmesbury of Malmesbury (Sept. 1788), and\r\npermitted by the king of Prussia to bear the Prussian eagle on his arms,\r\nand by the prince of Orange to use his motto \"Je maintiendrai.\" He\r\nreturned to England, and took an anxious interest in politics, which\r\nended in his seceding from the Whig party with the duke of Portland in\r\n1793; and in that year he was sent by Pitt, but in vain, to try to keep\r\nPrussia true to the first coalition against France. In 1794 he was sent\r\nto Brunswick to solicit the hand of the unfortunate Princess Caroline\r\nfor the prince of Wales, to marry her as proxy, and conduct her to her\r\nhusband in England. In 1796 and 1797 he was at Paris and Lille vainly\r\nnegotiating with the French Directory. After 1797 he became partially\r\ndeaf, and quitted diplomacy altogether; but for his long and eminent\r\nservices he was in 1800 created earl of Malmesbury, and Viscount\r\nFitzharris, of Heron Court in the county of Hants. He now became a sort\r\nof political Nestor, consulted on foreign policy by successive foreign\r\nministers, trusted by men of the most different ideas in political\r\ncrises, and above all the confidant, and for a short time after Pitt's\r\ndeath almost the political director, of Canning. Younger men were also\r\nwont to go to him for advice, and Lord Palmerston particularly, who was\r\nhis ward, was tenderly attached to him, and owed many of his ideas on\r\nforeign policy directly to his teaching. His later years were free from\r\npolitics, and till his death on the 21st of November 1820 he lived very\r\nquietly and almost forgotten. As a statesman, Malmesbury had an\r\ninfluence among his contemporaries which is scarcely to be understood\r\nfrom his writings, but which must have owed much to personal charm of\r\nmanner and persuasiveness of tongue; as a diplomatist, he seems to have\r\ndeserved his reputation, and shares with Macartney, Auckland and\r\nWhitworth the credit of raising diplomacy from a profession in which\r\nonly great nobles won the prizes to a career opening the path of honour\r\nto ability. He was succeeded as 2nd earl by his son James Edward\r\n(1778-1841), under-secretary for foreign affairs under Canning; from\r\nwhom the title passed to James Howard, 3rd earl of Malmesbury (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  Malmesbury did not publish anything himself, except an account of the\r\n  Dutch revolution, and an edition of his father's works, but his\r\n  important _Diaries_ (1844) and _Letters_ (1870) were edited by his\r\n  grandson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMESBURY, JAMES HOWARD HARRIS, 3RD EARL OF (1807-1889), English\r\nstatesman, son of the 2nd earl, was born on the 25th of March 1807, and\r\neducated at Eton and Oriel College, Oxford. He led a life of travel for\r\nseveral years, making acquaintance with famous people; and in 1841 he\r\nhad only just been elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative,\r\nwhen his father died and he succeeded to the peerage. His political\r\ncareer, though not one which made any permanent impression on history,\r\nattracted a good deal of contemporary attention, partly from his being\r\nforeign secretary in 1852 and again in 1858-1859 (he was also lord privy\r\nseal in 1866-1868 and in 1874-1876), and partly from his influential\r\nposition as an active Tory of the old school in the House of Lords at a\r\ntime when Lord Derby and Mr Disraeli were, in their different ways,\r\nmoulding the Conservatism of the period. Moreover his long life--he\r\nsurvived till the 17th of May 1889--and the publication of his _Memoirs\r\nof an Ex-Minister_ in 1884, contributed to the reputation he enjoyed.\r\nThese _Memoirs_, charmingly written, full of anecdote, and containing\r\nmuch interesting material for the history of the time, remain his chief\r\ntitle to remembrance. Lord Malmesbury also edited his grandfather's\r\n_Diaries and Correspondence_ (1844), and in 1870 published _The First\r\nLord Malmesbury and His Friends: Letters from 1745 to 1820_. He was\r\nsucceeded as 4th earl by his nephew, Edward James (1842-1899), whose\r\nson, James Edward (b. 1872) became the 5th earl in 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMESBURY, a market town and municipal borough in the Chippenham\r\nparliamentary division of Wiltshire, England, 94½ m. W. of London by the\r\nGreat Western railway. Pop. (1901), 2854. It lies on a ridge surrounded\r\non all sides except the north-west by the river Avon and a small\r\ntributary. The church of St Mary and St Aldhelm, standing high, is a\r\nmajestic fragment consisting of the greater part of the nave (with\r\naisles) of a Benedictine abbey church. The ruined skeleton of the great\r\ntower arches now terminates the building eastward. The nave is\r\ntransitional Norman, with a Decorated superstructure including the\r\nclerestory. The south porch is one of the finest Norman examples extant,\r\nboth the outer and the inner doorways (especially the first) exhibiting\r\nthe typical ornament of the period in remarkable exuberance. With the\r\nexception of a crypt, the monastic buildings have disappeared. In the\r\nmarket square stands a fine market cross of the 16th century, borne upon\r\nan octagonal battlemented basement. Early English fragments of a\r\nhospital of St John of Jerusalem appear in the corporation almshouse.\r\nMalmesbury has an agricultural trade, with breweries, tanneries and\r\nmanufactures of silk and pillow lace. It is governed by a mayor, 4\r\naldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 178 acres.\r\n\r\nMaildulphus, a Scottish or Irish monk, who came into England about 635,\r\nbuilt a hermitage near the site of the modern Malmesbury\r\n(_Maildulphi-urbs_, _Maldelmesburh_, _Malmesbiri_) and gathered\r\ndisciples round him, thus forming the nucleus of the later abbey of\r\nwhich Aldhelm his pupil became the first abbot. Æthelstan, who was\r\nburied here (though his tomb in the church only dates from the 16th\r\ncentury), rebuilt and endowed the monastery. Round the abbey the town of\r\nMalmesbury grew up, and by the time of the Domesday Survey it had become\r\none of the only two Wiltshire boroughs. The first charter, said to be a\r\nforgery, purports to have been given by Æthelstan. It granted to the\r\nburgesses all privileges and free customs such as they held in the time\r\nof Edward the Elder, with many additional exemptions, in return for help\r\nrendered against the Danes. The castle built at Malmesbury during the\r\nreign of Henry I. gave a further impetus to the growth of the town\r\nduring the 12th and 13th centuries. It was not incorporated, however,\r\nuntil 1645, when it was made a free borough under the title of \"aldermen\r\nand burgesses of the borough of Malmesbury, County Wilts.\" By this\r\ncharter it was governed until 1885. The borough returned two members to\r\nparliament from 1295 to 1832 when the number was reduced to one. Finally\r\nin 1885 its representation was merged in that of the county. A grant of\r\na yearly fair on the 31st of March, the feast of St Aldhelm, was\r\nobtained from William II., and another for three days from the 25th of\r\nJuly from John. In 1792 fairs were held on the 28th of March, the 28th\r\nof April and the 29th of June, but in 1891 they had ceased entirely.\r\nJohn also granted a weekly market on Thursday. In the 16th and 18th\r\ncenturies it was held on Saturday, and in 1891 on the third Wednesday in\r\neach month. In the middle ages Malmesbury possessed a considerable cloth\r\nmanufacture, and at the Dissolution the abbey was bought by a rich\r\nclothier and fitted with looms for weaving. The trade in wool still\r\nflourished in 1751.\r\n\r\n  See _Victoria County History: Wiltshire_; and _Registrum\r\n  malmesburiense_ (1879-1880).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMÖ, a seaport of Sweden, chief town of the district (_län_) of\r\nMalmöhus, on a small bay of the Sound, 384 m. S.S.W. of Stockholm by\r\nrail. Pop. (1800), 38,054; (1900), 60,857. It is connected with\r\nCopenhagen, 17¼ m. W. by N., by steam-ferry, the Sound being kept open\r\nin winter by an ice-breaker. It is also the first important station in\r\nSweden on the Berlin-Stockholm route, which crosses the sea between\r\nSassnitz in Rügen and Trelleborg, 20 m. S.E. of Malmö. The town, which\r\nstands upon a level plain, formerly had strong fortifications, of which\r\nonly the citadel (Malmöhus) remains; in it the earl of Bothwell was\r\nimprisoned by Frederick II. of Denmark for some time after his departure\r\nfrom Scotland in 1567. The town-hall (1546, largely restored in 1864)\r\ncontains a handsome chamber, the Knutssal, formerly used by the council\r\nof the gild of Canute. The hall fronts the central square (_Stortorg_)\r\nwhich is planted with trees and contains a colossal statue of Charles X.\r\nby Johan Helenus Börjeson (b. 1835) erected in 1896. The most notable\r\nchurch is that of St. Peter (_Peterkyrka_), dating in part from 1319.\r\nMalmö is second to Stockholm as an industrial centre. There are\r\nbreweries and large works for the manufacture of machinery, among which\r\nmay be mentioned the Kockum mechanical works, with yards for the\r\nconstruction of vessels of war, and others; of cotton and woollen goods,\r\ngloves, chocolate, sweetmeats and tobacco. A large export trade is\r\ncarried on in butter and other agricultural produce, and matches. Coal\r\nis the chief import. The harborage includes an outer harbour of 22 ft.\r\ndepth, and two inner basins admitting vessels of 21 ft. draught, with\r\ndry dock and patent slip. Malmö returns four members to the second\r\nchamber of the Riksdag (parliament).\r\n\r\nMalmö (Malmhauge, Malmey, Malmöye, Malmoughe), sometimes called _Ancona\r\nScanorum_ or _Ellenbogen_, first appears in history about the middle of\r\nthe 13th century. During the Hanseatic period it was the most important\r\ncommercial town on the Sound, but in the 16th and 17th centuries greatly\r\nlost ground owing to the decay of its herring fisheries and the rise of\r\nits rival, Copenhagen. Its modern prosperity is largely due to the\r\nenterprise of Frans Snell, one of its merchants in the second half of\r\nthe 18th century, who first constructed the harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALMSEY, a strong sweet wine, originally made at Monemvasia (Gr. [Greek:\r\nMonembasia]), Napoli di Malvasia, in the Morea, Greece. The name of the\r\nplace was corrupted in Med. Lat. into _malmasia_, whence the English\r\nform of the word. The corruption malvasia gives the O. Fr. _malvesie_,\r\nfrom which comes the alternative English form \"malvoisie.\" The wine is\r\nnow made not only in Greece but also in Spain, Madeira and the Azores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALOCELLO, LANCILOTO (\"LANZAROTE, the 'Lancelot Maloisiel' of the\r\nFrench\"), leader of the first of modern European oceanic enterprises.\r\nThis was a Genoese expedition, which about 1270 seems to have sailed\r\ninto the Atlantic, re-discovered the \"Fortunate Islands\" or Canaries,\r\nand made something of a conquest and settlement in one of the most\r\nnortherly isles of this archipelago, still known (after the Italian\r\ncaptain) as Lanzarote. According to a Spanish authority of about 1345,\r\nthe anonymous Franciscan's _Conosçimiento de todos los reinos_,\r\n\"Lancarote\" was killed by the Canarian natives; but the castle built by\r\nhim was standing in 1402-1404, when it was utilized for the storage of\r\ngrain by the French conquerors under Gadifer de la Salle. To Malocello's\r\nenterprise, moreover, it is probable that Petrarch (born 1304) alludes\r\nwhen he tells how, within the memory of his parents, an armed fleet of\r\nGenoese penetrated to the \"Fortunatae\"; this passage some would refer,\r\nwithout sufficient authority, to the expedition of 1291. Malocello's\r\nname and nationality are certainly preserved by those early _Portolani_\r\nor scientific charts (such as the \"Dulcert\" of 1339 and the \"Laurentian\r\nPortolano\" of 1351), in which the African islands appear, for the first\r\ntime in history, in clear and recognizable form. Thus Dulcert reads\r\n_Insula de Lanzarotus_ and _Marocelus_, the Laurentian map _I. de\r\nLanzarote_, against Lanzarote Island, which is well depicted on both\r\ndesigns, and marked with the cross of Genoa. The _Conosçimiento_ (as\r\nnoticed above) explicitly derives the island-name from the Genoese\r\ncommander who perished here. Malocello's enterprise not only marks the\r\nbeginning of the oversea expansion of western Europe in exploration,\r\nconquest and colonization (after the age of Scandinavian world-roving\r\nhad passed); it is also probably not unconnected with the great Genoese\r\nventure of 1291 (in search of a waterway to India, which soon follows),\r\nwith which this attempt at Canarian discovery and dominion has been by\r\nsome unjustifiably identified.\r\n\r\n  See the _Conosçimiento_, p. 100, as edited by Marcos Jimenez de la\r\n  Espada in the _Boletin de la sociedad geográfica de Madrid_, (February\r\n  1877); _Le Canarien_ in P. Margry, _Conquête des ... Canaries_, p.\r\n  177; M. A. P. d'Avezac in vol. vi., part ii., of _L'Univers_, pp. 1-41\r\n  (_Îles africaines de l'océan atlantique_); C. R.

(1903), after the annexation of Barasoain and Santa Isabel, 27,025.\r\nThere are thirty-eight villages, or barrios, of which eight had, in\r\n1903, 1000 inhabitants or more. The principal language is Tagalog, but\r\nSpanish is spoken to some extent. Malolos is served by the Manila &\r\nDagupan railway, and is a trade centre of considerable importance. The\r\ncultivation of rice is an important industry. In 1898-99, during the\r\nFilipino revolt, Malolos was the seat of the rebel government, but it\r\nwas captured and reduced to desolation in March 1899. In 1904 a new\r\nmunicipal school building, a municipal market and a provincial building\r\nwere erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALONE, EDMOND (1741-1812), Irish Shakespearian scholar and editor, was\r\nborn in Dublin, on the 4th of October 1741, the son of a barrister and a\r\nmember of the Irish House of Commons. He was educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, and was called to the Irish bar in 1767. The death of\r\nhis father in 1774 assured him a competency, and he went to London,\r\nwhere he frequented literary and artistic circles. He frequently visited\r\nDr Johnson and was of great assistance to Boswell in revising and\r\nproofreading his _Life_, four of the later editions of which he\r\nannotated. He was intimate with Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom he sat for\r\na portrait now in the National Portrait Gallery. He was one of Reynolds'\r\nexecutors, and published a posthumous collection of his works (1798)\r\nwith a memoir. Horace Walpole, Burke, Canning, Lord Charlemont, and, at\r\nfirst, George Steevens, were among Malone's friends. Encouraged by the\r\ntwo last he devoted himself to the study of Shakespearian chronology,\r\nand the results of his \"Attempt to ascertain the Order in which the\r\nPlays of Shakespeare were written\" (1778) are still largely accepted.\r\nThis was followed in 1780 by two supplementary volumes to Steevens's\r\nversion of Dr Johnson's _Shakespeare_, partly consisting of observations\r\non the history of the Elizabethan stage, and of the text of doubtful\r\nplays; and this again, in 1783, by an appendix volume. His refusal to\r\nalter some of his notes to Isaac Reed's edition of 1785, which disagreed\r\nwith Steevens's, resulted in a quarrel with the latter. The next seven\r\nyears were devoted to Malone's own edition of Shakespeare in eleven\r\nvolumes, of which his essays on the history of the stage, his biography\r\nof Shakespeare, and his attack on the genuineness of the three parts of\r\nHenry VI., were especially valuable. His editorial work was lauded by\r\nBurke, criticized by Walpole and damned by Joseph Ritson. It certainly\r\nshowed indefatigable research and proper respect for the text of the\r\nearlier editions. Malone published a denial of the claim to antiquity of\r\nthe Rowley poems (see CHATTERTON), and in this (1782) as in his branding\r\n(1796) of the Ireland MSS. (see IRELAND, WILLIAM HENRY) as forgeries, he\r\nwas among the first to guess and state the truth. His elaborate edition\r\nof Dryden's works (1800), with a memoir, was another monument to his\r\nindustry, accuracy and scholarly care. In 1801 the university of Dublin\r\nmade him an LL.D. At the time of his death, on the 25th of April 1812,\r\nMalone was at work on a new octavo edition of Shakespeare, and he left\r\nhis material to James Boswell the younger; the result was the edition of\r\n1821--generally known as the Third Variorum edition--in twenty-one\r\nvolumes. Lord Sunderlin (1738-1816), his elder brother and executor,\r\npresented the larger part of Malone's splendid collection of books,\r\nincluding dramatic varieties, to the Bodleian Library, which afterwards\r\nbought many of his MS. notes and his literary correspondence. The\r\nBritish Museum also owns some of his letters and his annotated copy of\r\nJohnson's _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n  A memoir of Malone by James Boswell is included in the _Prolegomena_\r\n  to the edition of 1821. See also Sir J. Prior's _Life of Edmond\r\n  Malone_ (1860).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALONE, a village and the county-seat of Franklin county, in the\r\ntownship of Malone, in the N.E. part of New York, U.S.A., about 60 m.\r\nE.N.E. of Ogdensburg. Pop. (1890), 4986; (1900), 5935 (910\r\nforeign-born); (1905, state census), 6478; (1910), 6467. It is served by\r\nthe New York Central & Hudson River and the Rutland (N.Y. Central Lines)\r\nrailways. The village has a Memorial Park, Arsenal Green, on the site of\r\nan arsenal and parade-ground sold by the state in 1850, a state armoury,\r\nthe Northern New York Institute for Deaf Mutes, Franklin Academy, St\r\nJoseph's Ursuline Academy, and a detention-house for Chinamen entering\r\nthe state from Canada. From Malone tourists visit the Great North Woods,\r\nin the Adirondack foothills, about 15 m. distant. Iron ore and Potsdam\r\nsandstone are found near Malone. In the surrounding region hops,\r\npotatoes, &c., are grown, and there are dairying and livestock\r\ninterests. The village is a centre for the collection of hides and\r\npelts. It manufactures woollen goods, paper and pulp, &c., and has\r\nfoundry and machine shops and car repair shops. Malone, being on the\r\nline of communication between lakes Champlain and Ontario, was of\r\nstrategic importance in the war of 1812, and later was twice the\r\nrendezvous of Fenians for attacks on Canada. The township of Malone was\r\nsettled and erected from Chateaugay in 1805. The village was first known\r\nas Harison, was named Ezraville, in honour of Ezra L'Hommedieu, in 1808,\r\nreceived its present name in 1812, and was incorporated in 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALONIC ACID, C3H4O4 or CH2(COOH)2, occurs in the form of its calcium\r\nsalt in the sugar beet. It was first prepared in 1858 by V. Dessaignes,\r\nwho obtained it by oxidizing malic acid (_Ann._, 1858, 107, p. 251). It\r\nmay also be obtained by oxidizing allylene and propylene with cold\r\npotassium permanganate solution, by the hydrolysis of barbituric acid\r\n(malonyl urea) with alkalis (A. Baeyer, _Ann._, 1864, 130, p. 143); by\r\nthe hydrolysis of cyanacetic acid (H. Kolbe, _Ann._, 1864, 131, p. 349;\r\nH. Muller, _Ann._, 1864, 131, p. 352), and by the action of silver oxide\r\non [beta]-di-chloracrylic ester at 125° C. (O. Wallach, _Ann._, 1878,\r\n193, P. 25)\r\n\r\n  CCl2:CH·COOC2H5 + Ag2O + H2O =\r\n    2AgCl + HOOC·CH2·COOC2H5.\r\n\r\nIt crystallizes in monoclinic tables, and is readily soluble in water,\r\nalcohol and ether. The acid melts at 132° C., and at a higher\r\ntemperature it rapidly decomposes into acetic acid and carbon dioxide.\r\nWhen heated with bromine and water to 100° C. it forms tribromacetic\r\nacid, some bromoform being produced at the same time. Malonic acid, as\r\nwell as its esters, is characterized by the large number of condensation\r\nproducts it can form. In the presence of a dehydrating agent (such as\r\nacetic anhydride), it combines with aldehydes to form compounds of the\r\ntype R·CH:C(COOH)2, or their decomposition products (formed by loss of\r\nCO2) R·CH:CH·COOH.\r\n\r\n  Many salts of the acid are known and, with the exception of those of\r\n  the alkali metals, they are difficultly soluble in water. Many esters\r\n  of malonic acid have been prepared, the most important being the\r\n  _diethyl ester_ (_malonic ester_), CH2(COOC2H5)2, which is obtained by\r\n  dissolving monochloracetic acid in water, neutralizing the solution\r\n  with potassium carbonate, and then adding potassium cyanide and\r\n  warming the mixture until the reaction begins. When the reaction has\r\n  finished, the whole is evaporated and heated to about 130°-140° C. and\r\n  then allowed to cool. The mass is then covered with two-thirds of its\r\n  weight of alcohol, and saturated with hydrochloric acid gas. The whole\r\n  is then poured into ice-cold water, extracted by ether and the\r\n  ethereal solution distilled (L. Claisen, _Ann._, 1883, 218, p. 131).\r\n  It is a colourless liquid boiling at 197°.7-198°.2 C. (W. H. Perkin).\r\n  It is a most important synthetic reagent; with sodium or sodium\r\n  ethylate it forms sodio-malonic ester, which reacts readily with alkyl\r\n  halides, forming alkyl malonic esters, which are again capable of\r\n  forming sodium derivatives, that by further treatment with alkyl\r\n  halides yield the di-alkyl malonic esters. These esters are readily\r\n  hydrolysed and yield the mono- and di-alkyl malonic acids which, on\r\n  heating, are readily decomposed, with evolution of carbon dioxide and\r\n  the formation of mono- and di-alkyl acetic acids. The scheme of\r\n  reactions is shown thus:\r\n\r\n                                      R´I\r\n    CH2(COOR)2 --> CHN_a (COOR)2 --> CHR´(COOR)2\r\n                                          | NaOH\r\n                                          \\/\r\n    CO2 + CH2R´·COOH     <--          CHR´(COOH)2\r\n                                            R´´I\r\n    [CHR´(COOH)2NaOH     --> CNaR´(COOR)2 --> CR´R´´(COOR)2\r\n                                                  |\r\n                                                  \\/ NaOH\r\n                        CO2 + CHR´R´·COOH <-- CR´R´´(COOH)2\r\n\r\n  When sodio-malonic ester is heated to 145° C., it undergoes\r\n  condensation, with elimination of alcohol and formation of the benzene\r\n  derivative, _phloroglucin tricarboxylic ester_. The addition of urea\r\n  to an alcoholic solution of sodio-malonic ester results in the\r\n  formation of barbituric acid (A. Michael, _Jour. pr. Chem._, 1887 [2],\r\n  35, p. 456) The half nitrile of malonic acid is _cyanacetic acid_,\r\n  CN·CH·2 COOH, which, in the form of its ester, may be obtained by the\r\n  action of a solution of potassium cyanide on monochloracetic acid. The\r\n  solution obtained is neutralized, concentrated on the water-bath,\r\n  acidified by sulphuric acid and extracted with ether. It is then\r\n  converted into the lead salt, which is decomposed by sulphuretted\r\n  hydrogen and the solution is carefully concentrated (Th. Meves,\r\n  _Ann._, 1867, 143, p. 201). It melts at 70° C. and at higher\r\n  temperatures decomposes, with evolution of carbon dioxide and\r\n  formation of aceto-nitrile, CH3·CN. The true nitrile of malonic acid\r\n  is _methylene cyanide_, CH2(CN)2, which is obtained by distilling a\r\n  mixture of cyanacetamide and phosphorus pentoxide. It is a crystalline\r\n  solid, which melts at 29°-30° C. and boils at 218°-219° C., and is\r\n  readily soluble in alcohol and ether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALORY, SIR THOMAS, translator and compiler of the famous English\r\nclassic, the _Morte d'Arthur_. Previous to the publication of Professor\r\nKittredge's monograph, _Who was Sir Thomas Malory?_ the identity of this\r\nwriter remained an unsolved problem. Mr. Sidney Lee, in the _Dictionary\r\nof National Biography_, was compelled to admit that he could find no one\r\nof that name fulfilling the necessary conditions. Of direct evidence we\r\nhave very little; in the concluding passage of the book the author asks\r\nthe prayers of the reader for \"Syr Thomas Maleore knyght,\" and states\r\nthat the book was ended \"the ix. yere of the reygne of Kyng Edward the\r\nfourth.\" Caxton, in his preface, says that he printed the book \"after a\r\ncopye unto me delivered whyche copye Syr Thomas Malorye dyd take oute of\r\ncerteyn bookes of frensshe and reduced it in to Englysshe\"; in his\r\ncolophon he repeats this statement, adding that he himself is\r\nresponsible for the division of the work into books and chapters, and\r\nthat it was printed in 1485. It will be noted that Caxton does not say\r\nthat he received the book from Malory, only that he had received a copy\r\nmade by Malory; from this Professor Kittredge draws the conclusion that\r\nthe compiler was no longer living. The problem then is to find a Thomas\r\nMalory who was (a) a knight, (b) alive in the ninth year of King Edward\r\nIV. (Mar. 4, 1469-Mar. 3, 1470), and (c) who was no longer living in\r\nJuly (or June) 1485.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions Professor Kittredge finds fulfilled in the life of\r\nSir Thomas Malory, knight, of Newbold Revell (or Fenny Newbold), M.P.\r\nfor Warwickshire in 1445. The date of Sir Thomas's birth is uncertain,\r\nbut he succeeded his father, Sir John, in 1433 or 1434. Previously to\r\nthis he had served in France, in the retinue of the earl of Warwick,\r\nmost probably during the time that that nobleman held the office of\r\ncaptain of Calais. It seems probable that he is also to be identified\r\nwith a \"Thomas Malorie, miles,\" who in 1468 was, on account of the part\r\nplayed by him in the Wars of the Roses, excluded with several others\r\nfrom the operation of a pardon issued by Edward IV. As, however, on the\r\ndeath of Sir Thomas on the 14th of March 1470, there was no difficulty\r\nas to inheritance, his estates passing to his grandson, he must, if this\r\nidentification be correct, have come under the general amnesty of 1469.\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that so far as it is in our power to state\r\nthe question this Sir Thomas Malory fulfils all the necessary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the career of the earl of Warwick in\r\nFrance was marked by certain picturesque and chivalric features which\r\nmight well impress the imagination of a young retainer. John Rous, in\r\nhis _Life of Richard Earl of Warwick_, tells us that at a certain\r\ntourney held near Calais at Christmastide, Earl Richard appeared three\r\ndays running in different armour, overthrowing his adversary on each\r\noccasion--an exploit obviously imitated from the chivalric romances of\r\nthe period.\r\n\r\nThe work with which Malory's name is connected is an abridged\r\ncompilation of the great body of Arthurian romance in its latest form.\r\nThe _Merlin_ (Vulgate and Suite), _Tristan_, _Lancelot_, _Queste_ and\r\n_Mort Artus_ are all represented, the only branch omitted is that\r\ndealing with the \"early history\" of the Grail, the _Joseph of Arimathea_\r\nand _Grand S. Graal_. Thanks mainly to the labours of Dr Oskar Sommer,\r\nwe can now assign the majority of the books to their separate sources,\r\nalthough certain stories, such as the adventures of Sir Gareth under the\r\npseudonym of Beaumains, the handling of Sir Urre of Hungary, and the\r\ndetails of the abduction of Guenevere by Meleagaunt, still remain\r\nunidentified. But we do not yet know whether Malory himself was\r\nresponsible for this selection, or whether he found it ready to hand in\r\na MS., the \"Frensshe Booke\" to which he often refers. To make such a\r\ncompilation at first hand, considering the extent of the ground covered,\r\nwould involve an enormous amount of study and selection, and the access\r\nto a very large library--conditions which scarcely seem to fit in with\r\nthe social position and activities of Sir Thomas. On the other hand it\r\nis undeniable that the medieval copyists, at the instance of their\r\npatrons, did make compilations from the various romances within their\r\nreach, such as e.g. the enormous codex 112 (_fonds Franç._) of the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, which includes large sections of the _Tristan_,\r\nthe _Lancelot_, and the _Merlin_ Suite. Taking into consideration alike\r\nwhat Malory retains and what he omits, it seems most probable that he\r\nwas in possession, not of complete copies of the romances, but of one or\r\nmore volumes of compilations from these sources.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of matter it must be admitted that the _Morte d'\r\nArthur_ does not represent the Arthurian cycle at its best, but rather\r\nin the period of its decadence; nor does Malory in any way endeavour to\r\novercome the difficulties caused by the juxtaposition of a number of\r\nindependent (and often contradictory) versions. This is especially\r\nnoticeable in his treatment of Gawain; in the section derived from the\r\n_Lancelot_ and _Mort Artus_ he is a good and valiant knight, \"a ful\r\nnoble knyghte as ever was borne,\" in those derived from the _Tristan_\r\nand the _Queste_, he is treacherous, dissolute, and a murderer of good\r\nknights.\r\n\r\nThe great charm of Malory's work lies in his style; stately, earnest and\r\ndignified, it has lent to the relations between Lancelot and Guenevere a\r\ncharacter of truth and vitality in which the French original is wholly\r\nlacking. Malory achieved a remarkable feat--he took the Arthurian story\r\nin its worst and weakest form and he imparted to it a moral force and\r\nelevation which the cycle, even in its earlier and finer stage, had,\r\nsave in the unique case of Von Eschenbach's _Parzival_, never possessed.\r\nWhile genuine lovers of the Arthurian cycle must regret that the\r\nromances should only be known to the great majority of English readers\r\nthrough the versions of Malory and Tennyson, it is impossible to\r\nwithhold from the _Morte d' Arthur_ the admiration due to an\r\nimperishable monument of English language and literature.\r\n\r\n  See _Who was Sir Thomas Malory?_ G. L. Kittredge (_Harvard Studies and\r\n  Notes_, vol. v., 1896); _Morte d' Arthur_, ed. by Dr Oskar Sommer (an\r\n  exact reproduction of the original text in 2 vols.)--vol. iii. a study\r\n  on \"_The Sources of Malory._\" The sections on _Lancelot_ and _Queste_\r\n  are unfortunately very inadequate; for these cf. _The Legend of Sir\r\n  Lancelot_, Grimm Library, vol. xii.     (J. L. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALOT, HECTOR HENRI (1830-1907), French novelist and man of letters, the\r\nson of a notary, was born at La Bouille (Seine Inférieure) on the 20th\r\nof May 1830. He studied law at Rouen and Paris, but literature early\r\nabsorbed his attention. He collaborated in the _Biographie générale_ of\r\nDidot, became literary critic of _L'Opinion Nationale_, and dramatic\r\ncritic of the _Lloyd français_. He is the author of a long series of\r\npopular novels dealing with contemporary life, including: a trilogy of\r\ndomestic novels entitled _Victimes d'amour_ (1859, 1865, 1866); _Un Beau\r\nfrère_ (1869); _Madame Obernin_ (1870); _Le Docteur Claude_ (1879);\r\n_Justice_ (1889). _Les Aventures de Romain Kalbris_ (1869) and _Sans\r\nfamille_ (1888) are excellent stories for children. A complete edition\r\nof Hector Malot's works appeared in 1894-1897. He died at Vincennes in\r\nJuly 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALOU, JULES ÉDOUARD XAVIER (1810-1886), Belgian statesman, one of the\r\nleaders of the clerical party, was born at Ypres on the 19th of October\r\n1810. He was a civil servant in the department of justice when he was\r\nelected to the Chamber of Deputies by his native constituency in 1841,\r\nand was for some time governor of the province of Antwerp. He was\r\nminister of finance in the coalition ministry of J. B. Nothomb in 1844,\r\nand formed with B. T. de Theux a Catholic cabinet in 1846, which was\r\noverthrown in the Liberal victory of 1847. Malou then became a member\r\nof the senate, and his party only regained ascendancy in 1870. The\r\nextreme clerical ministry of Baron d'Anethan retired in December 1871\r\nafter serious rioting in Brussels, and Malou was the real, though not\r\nthe nominal, head of the more moderate clerical administrations of de\r\nTheux and Aspremont-Lynden (1870-1878). He was wise enough to disavow\r\nthe noisy sympathy of Belgian Ultramontane politicians with the German\r\nvictims of the _Kulturkampf_, and, retaining in his own hands the\r\nportfolio of finance, he subordinated his clerical policy to a useful\r\nadministration in commercial matters, including a development of the\r\nrailway system. It was only after the fall of the ministry in 1878 that\r\nhe adopted a frankly clerical policy, and when he became chief of a new\r\ngovernment in June 1884 he proceeded to undo the educational compromise\r\nof his predecessors in the Frère-Orban ministry. His legislation in\r\nfavour of the Catholic schools caused rioting in Brussels, and in\r\nOctober the king demanded the retirement of MM. Jacobs and Woeste, the\r\nmembers of the cabinet against whom popular indignation was chiefly\r\ndirected. Malou followed them into retirement, and died at Woluwe Saint\r\nLambert, in Brabant, on the 11th of July 1886. He was a financier of\r\ngreat knowledge and experience, and his works (of which a long list is\r\ngiven in Koninck's _Bibliographie nationale de Belgique_) include three\r\nseries (1874-1880) of memoirs on financial questions, edited by him for\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, besides pamphlets on railroad proposals, mining\r\nand other practical questions. His brother Jean Baptiste Malou\r\n(1809-1864) was a well-known divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALOUET, PIERRE VICTOR, BARON (1740-1814), French publicist and\r\npolitician, was born at Riom (Puy-de-Dôme) on the 11th of February 1740,\r\nthe son of a lawyer. He entered the civil service and was employed\r\nsuccessively at the French embassy in Lisbon, in the administrative\r\ndepartment of the duc de Broglie's army, as commissary in San Domingo\r\nfrom 1767-1774, and, after his return to France, as commissary-general\r\nof the marine. In 1776 he was entrusted to carry out plans of\r\ncolonization in French Guiana, but was superseded in 1779. On his return\r\nto France he was well received at court, and the execution of his plans\r\nin Guiana was assured. He became intendant of the port of Toulon, and in\r\n1789 was returned to the states-general, where he soon became well known\r\nas a defender of the monarchical principle. He emigrated to England in\r\nSeptember, 1792, but shortly afterwards sought in vain permission to\r\nreturn to assist in the defence of Louis XVI. His name was erased from\r\nthe list of emigrants in 1801 by Napoleon, who restored him to his\r\nposition in the service and sent him to Antwerp as commissioner-general\r\nand maritime prefect to superintend the erection of defence works, and\r\nthe creation of a fleet. He entered the council of state in 1810, but,\r\nhaving offended the emperor by his plainness of speech, he was disgraced\r\nin 1812. At the Restoration, Louis XVIII. made him minister of marine;\r\nand he died on the 7th of September 1814.\r\n\r\n  The most important documents for his domestic and colonial policy are\r\n  a _Collection de ses opinions à l'Assemblée Nationale_ (3 vols.,\r\n  1791-1792); and _Collection de mémoires et correspondances officielles\r\n  sur l'administration des colonies et notamment sur la Guiane française\r\n  et hollandaise_ (5 vols., 1802).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALPIGHI, MARCELLO (1628-1694), Italian physiologist, was born at\r\nCrevalcuore near Bologna, on the 10th of March 1628. At the age of\r\nseventeen he began the study of philosophy; it appears that he was also\r\nin the habit of amusing himself with the microscope. In 1649 he started\r\nto study medicine; after four years at Bologna he graduated there as\r\ndoctor. He at once applied to be admitted to lecture in the university,\r\nbut it was not till after three years (1656) that his request was\r\ngranted. A few months later he was appointed to the chair of theoretical\r\nmedicine at Pisa, where he enjoyed the friendship and countenance of G.\r\nA. Borelli. At the end of four years he left Pisa, on the ground of\r\nill-health, and returned to Bologna. A call to be professor primarius at\r\nMessina (procured for him through Borelli, who had in the meantime\r\nbecome professor there) induced him to leave Bologna in 1662. His\r\nengagement at Messina was for a term of four years, at an annual\r\nstipend of 1000 scudi. An attempt was made to retain him at Messina\r\nbeyond that period, but his services were secured for his native\r\nuniversity, and he spent the next twenty-five years there. In 1691,\r\nbeing then in his sixty-fourth year, and in failing health, he removed\r\nto Rome to become private physician to Pope Innocent XII., and he died\r\nthere of apoplexy three years later, on the 30th of November 1694.\r\nShortly before his death, he drew up a long account of his academical\r\nand scientific labours, correspondence and controversies, and committed\r\nit to the charge of the Royal Society of London, a body with which he\r\nhad been in intimate relations for more than twenty years. The\r\nautobiography, along with some other posthumous writings, was published\r\nin London in 1696, at the cost of the Society. The personal details left\r\nby Malpighi are few and dry. His narrative is mainly occupied with a\r\nsummary of his scientific contributions and an account of his relations\r\nto contemporary anatomists, and is entirely without graces of style or\r\nelements of ordinary human interest.\r\n\r\n  Malpighi was one of the first to apply the microscope to the study of\r\n  animal and vegetable structure; and his discoveries were so important\r\n  that he may be considered to be the founder of microscopic anatomy. It\r\n  was his practice to open animals alive, and some of his most striking\r\n  discoveries were made in those circumstances. Although Harvey had\r\n  correctly inferred the existence of the capillary circulation, he had\r\n  never seen it; it was reserved for Malpighi in 1661 (four years after\r\n  Harvey's death) to see for the first time the marvellous spectacle of\r\n  the blood coursing through a network of small tubes on the surface of\r\n  the lung and of the distended urinary bladder of the frog. We are\r\n  enabled to measure the difficulties of microscopic observation at the\r\n  time by the fact that it took Malpighi four years longer to reach a\r\n  clear understanding of the corpuscles in the frog's blood, although\r\n  they are the parts of the blood by which its movement in the\r\n  capillaries is made visible. His discovery of the capillary\r\n  circulation was given to the world in the form of two letters _De\r\n  Pulmonibus_, addressed to Borelli, published at Bologna in 1661 and\r\n  reprinted at Leiden and other places in the years following; these\r\n  letters contained also the first account of the vesicular structure of\r\n  the human lung, and they made a theory of respiration for the first\r\n  time possible. The achievement that comes next both in importance and\r\n  in order of time was a demonstration of the plan of structure of\r\n  secreting glands; against the current opinion (revived by F. Ruysch\r\n  forty years later) that the glandular structure was essentially that\r\n  of a closed vascular coil from which the secretion exuded, he\r\n  maintained that the secretion was formed in terminal acini standing in\r\n  open communication with the ducts. The name of Malpighi is still\r\n  associated with his discovery of the soft or mucous character of the\r\n  lower stratum of the epidermis, of the vascular coils in the cortex of\r\n  the kidney, and of the follicular bodies in the spleen. He was the\r\n  first to attempt the finer anatomy of the brain, and his descriptions\r\n  of the distribution of grey matter and of the fibre-tracts in the\r\n  cord, with their extensions to the cerebrum and cerebellum, are\r\n  distinguished by accuracy; but his microscopic study of the grey\r\n  matter conducted him to the opinion that it was of glandular structure\r\n  and that it secreted the \"vital spirits.\" At an early period he\r\n  applied himself to vegetable histology as an introduction to the more\r\n  difficult study of the animal tissues, and he was acquainted with the\r\n  spiral vessels of plants in 1662. It was not till 1671 that he wrote\r\n  his _Anatome plantarum_ and sent it to the Royal Society, who\r\n  published it in the following year. An English work under a similar\r\n  title (_Anatomy of Vegetables_) had been published in London a few\r\n  months earlier, by Nehemiah Grew; so that Malpighi's priority as a\r\n  vegetable histologist is not so incontestable as it is in animal\r\n  histology. The _Anatome plantarum_ contained an appendix,\r\n  _Observations de ovo incubato_, which gave an account (with good\r\n  plates) of the development of the chick (especially of the later\r\n  stages) in many points more complete than that of Harvey, although the\r\n  observations were needlessly lessened in value by being joined to the\r\n  metaphysical notion of \"praedelineation\" in the undeveloped ovum.\r\n\r\n  He also wrote _Epistolae anatomicae Marc. Malpighii et Car.\r\n  Fracassati_ (Amsterdam, 1662) (on the tongue, brain, skin, omentum,\r\n  &c.); _De viscerum structura: exercitatio anatomica_ (London, 1669);\r\n  _De structura glandularum conglobatarum_ (London, 1689); _Opera\r\n  posthuma, et vita a seipso scripta_ (London, 1697; another edition,\r\n  with preface and additions, was published at Amsterdam in 1700.). An\r\n  edition containing all his works except the last two was published in\r\n  London in 1687, in 2 vols. folio, with portrait and plates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALPLAQUET, a village of France in the department of the Nord, close to\r\nthe Belgian frontier and about 10 miles S. by E. of Mons, famous as the\r\nscene of the battle, September 1709, between the Allies under the duke\r\nof Marlborough and Prince Eugène and the French commanded by Marshal\r\nVillars, in which the former were victorious. The country to the west\r\nand south of Mons is enclosed by a semicircular wall of woods and broken\r\nground, through which there are only two important gaps--that of\r\nJemappes (famous in 1792) to the west, and that of Aulnois, in which\r\nstands the village of Malplaquet, to the south. In the latter gap and\r\nthe woods on either side Villars took up his position facing\r\nnorth-eastwards, on August 29/September 9. The forces in presence, over\r\n90,000 on each side, were exceptionally large, and the French army in\r\nparticular represented the spirit of its nation to a degree unusual in\r\nthe armies of that time. Villars was the best general in the service of\r\nLouis XIV. and the veteran Marshal Boufflers, though senior to him, had\r\nvolunteered to serve as his second in command. Marlborough and Eugène\r\nlay with their army between Mons and the French camps, which were almost\r\nwithin cannon shot. Marlborough's own wish was for an immediate battle,\r\nbut he was opposed by the Dutch deputies at his headquarters, and even\r\nby Eugène, so that it was only on August 31/September 11 that the attack\r\nactually took place. Villars had made full use of his respite. The\r\nFrench right stood at the fringe of the wood of Lanière, the left was\r\nstrongly posted in the midst of the wood of Taisnière, and across the\r\ntwo and a half miles of open ground between the woods the position was\r\nentrenched with several successive lines of works. The troops were\r\nalmost equally distributed along the whole line as usual, and the\r\ncavalry was massed in rear of the infantry. In the Allied army the\r\nmounted troops were also kept back, but for the most part distributed to\r\nthe various infantry commands.\r\n\r\nThe intention of Marlborough and Eugène, when on the morning of the\r\nbattle they examined this formidable position, was to deliver the main\r\nattack upon the French left wing, combining the assaults of several\r\ncolumns on its front and flanks. In this quarter the French not only\r\nheld the interior of the wood but also were thrown forward so as to\r\noccupy the edges of its north-eastern salient, and upon the two faces of\r\nthis salient Count Lottum (1650-1719) with the Prussians, and Count von\r\nder Schulenburg (1661-1747) with the Austrian infantry were to deliver a\r\ndouble attack, while farther to the Allied right a column under the\r\nEnglish General Withers was detached to make a wide turning movement\r\nthrough the woods. Marlborough took command on the right, Eugène on the\r\nleft. The centre, which was intended only to observe the enemy until the\r\ndecision had been forced at the wood of Taisnière, consisted of Lord\r\nOrkney's British corps and the prince of Orange's Dutch contingent.\r\nThese extended across the Trouée d'Aulnois as soon as the combined\r\nattack of Lottum and Schulenburg opened. The general advance was covered\r\nby a heavy cannonade, and the salient of the Taisnière wood was duly\r\nattacked on its two faces by the Prussians and Austrians about 9 a.m.\r\nThey encountered a sterner resistance than in any of the battles and\r\ncombats of the past seven campaigns, for on this field the defenders\r\nwere fighting, not as hitherto for the interests of their king, but to\r\ndefend their country, and the regiments of Picardie and Champagne which\r\nheld the salient were the oldest and most famous of the French line.\r\nLottum attacked the works on the eastern edge, again and again without\r\nsuccess, until three British battalions had to be sent to reinforce him,\r\nand Marlborough placed himself with a corps of cavalry in close support.\r\nAt last the entrenchments were stormed. Schulenburg, with the Austrians,\r\nhad by this time fought his way through the woods and undergrowth, and\r\nthe united force pressed back the French farther and farther into the\r\nwood. Still, so stubborn was the defence and so dense the wood that the\r\nimpetus of the assault died away and the troops on both sides broke up\r\ninto small disconnected bodies, fighting too fiercely to be amenable to\r\nsuperior control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Hon. J. W. Fortescue, _History of the British\r\nArmy_, by permission of Macmillan & Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nBut the French were not reinforced from their right wing as Villars\r\nexpected. The prince of Orange, far from merely observing the hostile\r\nright as he had been ordered to do, committed his corps, very early in\r\nthe battle, to a serious assault upon it, which Boufflers repulsed with\r\nenormous loss. The Dutch infantry never recovered from its casualties on\r\nthis day, and the memory of Malplaquet was strong even at Fontenoy\r\nnearly forty years afterwards. Some Hanoverian troops which took part in\r\nthis futile attack suffered equally heavily. The only advantage to the\r\nAllies--an advantage which, as it happened, counted for much--was that\r\nBoufflers did not dare to send reinforcements to the hard-pressed left\r\nwing. Thanks to this the Austrians and Prussians, with the English\r\ndetached to their aid, made steady progress in the wood of Taisnière.\r\nVillars launched the \"Irish brigade\" to check the advance of the Allies,\r\nand this famous corps charged into the forest. Villars, Eugène and\r\nMarlborough personally led their troops in the encounter which followed.\r\nEugène was wounded, but refused to quit the field. Villars was more\r\nseriously hurt, and after trying in vain to direct the fighting from a\r\nchair was carried insensible from the field. At this crisis General\r\nWithers, who commanded the force that had been ordered to turn the\r\nFrench extreme left, and had fought his way through the forest, appeared\r\non the scene. The British 18th regiment (Royal Irish), encountering the\r\nFrench _Royal Irlandais_, put it to the rout, and Villars's\r\ncounterstroke was at an end. The French maintained themselves on this\r\nside only by the aid of troops drawn from the centre and right, and this\r\ngave the Allied centre the opportunity which the prince of Orange had so\r\nrashly anticipated. The great attack over the open was carried out, in\r\nspite of the previous repulse, with the greatest determination. Preceded\r\nby forty guns, the corps of the prince of Orange and Lord Orkney swiftly\r\ncarried the first line of works. The Allied cavalry then pushed out to\r\nthe front, and horse, foot and artillery were combined in the last\r\nadvance. Boufflers's cavalry masses, coming into play for the first\r\ntime, fought hard, and the struggle fluctuated with the arrival of\r\nsuccessive reserves on either side, but in the end, shortly before 3\r\np.m., Boufflers (who had been in command since Villars's fall) decided\r\nto retreat. The Allies had no troops left intact for the pursuit, and\r\nthose engaged had expended their last efforts. Moreover Boufflers,\r\nexperienced soldier as he was, drew off his men before they had lost\r\ntheir order and discipline.\r\n\r\nThus this \"very murdering battle\" as Marlborough called it--the last and\r\ngreatest pitched battle of the war--was almost barren of results. The\r\nAllies lost not less than twenty thousand men, or nearly a quarter of\r\nthe whole force, the thirty battalions of the Dutch infantry losing half\r\ntheir numbers. On the French side there were some twelve thousand\r\ncasualties. If further evidence were necessary to prove that the French\r\nfought their hardest, it could be found in the fact that whereas in\r\nalmost every other battle, from 1660 to 1792, there were deserters and\r\nprisoners by the thousand, at Malplaquet only 500 of the French fell\r\ninto the hands of the victors unwounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALSTATT-BURBACH, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province on\r\nthe right bank of the Saar (Sarre), which separates it from Saarbrücken.\r\nPop. (1900), 31,195. It lies in the midst of an important coal-mining\r\nand industrial district, and is itself little more than a long and\r\nnarrow row of manufactories and workmen's houses. The largest factories\r\nare engaged in the production of iron, steel and cement. There is a\r\nlarge wharf on the river for the export of coal.\r\n\r\n  Malstatt received municipal rights in 1321. These, however, were\r\n  afterwards resigned to the newer town of Saarbrücken, and in 1818\r\n  Malstatt and Burbach were two small villages with a joint population\r\n  of only about 800. About the middle of the century the population\r\n  began to increase rapidly, in consequence of the development of the\r\n  mining industry of the district and the extension of the railway\r\n  system, and in 1874 the two villages were united to form a town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALT (O. Eng., _mealt_; O. Sax., _malt_; O. Teut., _maltos_; Mod. Ger.,\r\n_Malz_; Scand., _malt_; probably derived from the Sanskrit _mrdu_, soft,\r\nthus having reference to the fact that malt is raw grain rendered soft\r\nor tender), the name given to grain in which germination has been caused\r\nto proceed to a certain stage and has then been arrested by the removal\r\nof water and the application of heat. During this limited germination\r\nenzymes are developed (see FERMENTATION), and the constituents of the\r\ngrain modified so that the finished malt, when ground and submitted to\r\nthe mashing process (see BREWING), differs from the original raw grain\r\nin that the greater portion dissolves. This solubility is, however, a\r\ndirect one to a slight extent only; it is due for the most part to the\r\naction of the malt enzymes, diastase, &c. on the constituents of the\r\ngrain, the main portion of which are of themselves insoluble. Thus\r\nstarch, the main constituent of all graminaceous seeds, probably exists\r\nin the same condition in raw grain and in malt. When however the malt is\r\nmashed, the starch is attacked by the enzyme diastase, and converted by\r\nthe process of hydrolysis into a mixture of soluble compounds, e.g. the\r\ncrystalline sugar, maltose, and a number of gummy substances known as\r\nmaltodextrins. But to a certain extent starch and other carbohydrate\r\nsubstances are rendered directly soluble and diffusible during the\r\nmalting process, some of the products serving the respiratory needs of\r\nthe growing germ, others being assimilated by the plantlet and\r\nreconverted into reserve carbohydrates in the tissues of the germ and\r\nrootlets, whilst the remaining portions are retained as such in the\r\nfinished malt. Similarly certain of the nitrogenous constituents of the\r\ngrain, the proteïns, are broken down and rendered soluble by proteolytic\r\nenzymes, the products being assimilated to a certain extent by the germ\r\nand rootlets, by the cells of which they are again built up into complex\r\nproteïns, whilst others remain in their simplified form. It is now known\r\nthat proteolytic enzymes exist in finished malt, and that, when the\r\nmashing process is conducted under certain conditions, these are able to\r\ndegrade and render soluble some of the higher proteïns present in the\r\nmalt. When germination is allowed to proceed as it does when the grain\r\nis planted in the soil, the whole of the contents are rendered soluble\r\nby degrees and in turn assimilated by the growing plantlet. By the\r\nlimited germination which constitutes the malting process, however, the\r\nbalance of soluble compounds left in the finished malt is from 15 to 25%\r\nof the total weight of the corn.\r\n\r\nAlthough other seeds of the natural order Gramineae are occasionally\r\nmalted, the greater portion of malt is made from the various species of\r\n_Hordeum_, known by the name of barley (q.v.), bigg, or bere. Indeed\r\nordinary beer derives its characteristic flavour to the greatest extent\r\nfrom barley malt. A small proportion of malted oats or malted wheat is\r\nsometimes used in conjunction with barley malt for certain kinds of\r\nbeer, whilst rye, maize, and even rice are occasionally malted. Barley\r\nis, however, the grain best adapted for making malt intended for brewing\r\nbeer, and accordingly some space will be devoted to a description of\r\nthose varieties of this grain which are used by the brewer.\r\n\r\nBarley belongs to the genus Hordeum, of which there are numerous species\r\nand varieties. Linnaeus and the earlier botanists recognized six species\r\nof cultivated barleys, but modern botanists usually consider all\r\ncultivated barleys as belonging to one species to which the name _H.\r\nsativum_ has been given. Körnicke regards _H. spontaneum_, a very long\r\nthin-grained two-rowed barley (see below) which grows in the East, as\r\nbeing the parent form; but E. S. Beaven inclines to the view that wild\r\nspecies of more than one form were originally used as food and\r\nsubsequently cultivated. The last-named author has drawn up a scheme of\r\nclassification for the varieties and races of cultivated barleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.    FIG. 2.    FIG. 3.

Beaven in _Journ. Fed. Inst.\r\nBrewing_ (1902), 8. 542.]\r\n\r\nIn an ear of barley the primary axis or rachis is divided into\r\ninternodes of which there may be any number up to forty. Each internode\r\nbears three single-flowered spikelets arranged alternately on either\r\nside of the rachis. In the six-rowed varieties the whole of these\r\nspikelets attain maturity, whilst in the two-rowed varieties only one on\r\neach side of the rachis, viz. the median, develops. British beer is\r\nbrewed principally from the malt made from home-grown two-rowed barleys.\r\nOf late years, however, it has been found advantageous to employ a\r\nproportion of malt made from the thinner and more husky foreign barleys,\r\nmostly six-rowed varieties. The corns of two-rowed barleys are as a rule\r\nplumper than those of six-rowed barleys.\r\n\r\n  The most favourite barley for malting purposes grown in the United\r\n  Kingdom is the narrow-eared two-rowed _H. distichum_, commonly known\r\n  as Chevallier, from the name of the original cultivator, the Rev. John\r\n  Chevallier. Of late years the quantity of barley of the so-called\r\n  Goldthorpe type (_H. zeocriton_), used for malting, has increased. The\r\n  paleae or outer coverings of the corns of this variety are somewhat\r\n  \"greasy\" in appearance, and do not adhere so closely to the corn as in\r\n  the Chevallier. The corns of Goldthorpe barley possess a small dimple\r\n  or transverse furrow near the basal end. Further the basal bristle or\r\n  rachilla (the prolongation of the axis or point from which the corn\r\n  was originally developed) is invariably covered with long hairs,\r\n  whilst in the case of Chevallier it has generally very short hairs. In\r\n  the variety of Chevallier known as Archer, however, the rachilla has\r\n  somewhat long hairs. Further the corns of Chevallier barley lie nearly\r\n  vertical, that is almost parallel to the rachis, whereas in Goldthorpe\r\n  they are spread out at a greater angle, hence the name fan or peacock\r\n  barley given to that variety commonly known as sprat. It is believed\r\n  by some brewers that Goldthorpe barleys never yield malt of so high a\r\n  quality as do Chevallier barleys. On the other hand, when well\r\n  matured, Goldthorpes work evenly and freely on the malting floors; and\r\n  from an agricultural point of view they have the advantage of standing\r\n  up better against unfavourable weather conditions on account of their\r\n  stouter straws. Numerous fresh varieties of barley are continually\r\n  being introduced as a result of artificial cross-fertilization, but\r\n  cross-fertilization rarely if ever occurs naturally.\r\n\r\n  Hungarian two-rowed barleys are excellent as regards quality, and\r\n  command a high price. The so-called Californian Chevallier and Chilean\r\n  Chevallier contain a certain admixture of the six-rowed _H. vulgare_.\r\n\r\n  Of the imported thin barleys may be mentioned Brewing Californian,\r\n  Brewing Chilean, Danubian and Smyrna (Yerli), all for the most part\r\n  six-rowed varieties; also Ouchak, consisting principally of a\r\n  two-rowed variety. For the manufacture of grain spirit a malt of high\r\n  diastatic activity is required, and this is largely made from a very\r\n  thin barley shipped from Odessa.\r\n\r\n  In the common six-rowed English barley or Scottish bere (_H.\r\n  vulgare_), the two lateral rows of spikelets springing from one side\r\n  of the rachis, either partially or entirely intersect and overlap the\r\n  alternate lateral spikelets which spring from the opposite side of the\r\n  rachis. This has given rise to the term \"four-rowed barley.\" Figs. 1-4\r\n  show some typical barleys in the ear.\r\n\r\n  The production of new varieties by cross-fertilization has of late\r\n  years attained a degree of almost mathematical precision by the\r\n  application of the law of inheritance first discovered by Gregor\r\n  Mendel in 1865, and brought to light in 1901 independently by de\r\n  Vries, Correns and Tschermak.\r\n\r\n_Constitution of Barley._--A grain of barley is shuttle-shaped; the end\r\ncontaining the germ which was originally attached to the rachis is known\r\nas the proximal end, whilst the opposite end of the corn is called the\r\ndistal end. A deep furrow runs down the more convex side, which is\r\naccordingly denoted the ventral side, the opposite side being\r\ndistinguished as the dorsal side. Within the ventral furrow at the\r\nproximal end is the rachilla already referred to. The skin or husk of a\r\nbarleycorn consists of two paleae, one adhering to the dorsal side (the\r\npalea inferior) and the other to the ventral side (the palea superior);\r\nthe former overlaps the edges of the latter. The awn or beard is merely\r\nan elongation of the palea inferior. If the two paleae are removed from\r\na barleycorn after soaking it in water, it will be seen that there are\r\nother skins completely enveloping the embryo and endosperm. These are\r\nthe true skins, and are known as the pericarp and the testa\r\nrespectively. It may here be mentioned that A. J. Brown has shown\r\nrecently that the embryo and endosperm of a barleycorn are enclosed in a\r\nsemi-permeable membrane, i.e. one which allows the passage of water to\r\nthe interior of the corn, but not of certain salts and acids. This\r\nproperty appears to be associated with one of the layers of the testa.\r\nNext to these skins will be seen the triple layer of thick-walled\r\nsquare-shaped aleurone cells.\r\n\r\nThe histology of the barleycorn is best studied by the examination of\r\nsections under the microscope. The grain consists of two main portions,\r\nthe embryo or germ, and the endosperm, the storehouse of reserve\r\nmaterials for the growing plant.\r\n\r\n  The accompanying illustrations show portions of longitudinal sections\r\n  of a barleycorn magnified to different degrees.\r\n\r\n  On examining fig. 5, which represents a section of the germ end of a\r\n  grain of barley cut through the ventral furrow, it will be noticed\r\n  that the rudimentary leaves, stem and roots are distinguishable. The\r\n  embryo lies embedded in a mass of cells, the part dividing it from the\r\n  endosperm being known as the scutellum. Special note should be taken\r\n  of the elongated cells known as the absorptive epithelial layer, which\r\n  has certain very important functions to fulfil during the process of\r\n  germination, notably in feeding the embryo when it begins to develop\r\n  into a young plant. Next to this, actually between the scutellum and\r\n  the endosperm, will be seen a layer of empty cells. These at one time\r\n  in the history and the development of the corn contained starch\r\n  granules, but this starch was absorbed during its later development by\r\n  the embryo. It will be observed further that the endosperm is filled\r\n  with a network of thin-walled cells closely packed with starch\r\n  granules, and smaller granules of proteïn matter (fig. 6). Nearest the\r\n  skin will be seen the triple layer of aleurone cells already referred\r\n  to (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Median longitudinal section of a barleycorn\r\nshowing the germ and its appendages.\r\n\r\n  a, Rudimentary leaves or plumules;\r\n  b, Rudimentary stem;\r\n  c, Rudimentary root;\r\n  d, Empty starch cells of the endosperm;\r\n  e, Absorptive epithelial layer;\r\n  f, Compressed layer of empty cells;\r\n  g, Starch cells (filled).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Section showing absorptive epithelial layer more\r\nhighly magnified.\r\n\r\n  d, Walls of starch cells;\r\n  e, Epithelial layer;\r\n  f, Compressed layer of empty cells;\r\n  g, Cells filled with starch granules;\r\n  h, Cells of the scutellum.]\r\n\r\n_Germination._--The barleycorn in its resting stage is in a state which\r\nmay be described as one of dormant vitality; it respires very slowly\r\nand thus loses weight during storage. The best and driest barleys are\r\nsaid to lose 1.3% of their weight in the first year, 0.9% in the second,\r\nand 0.5% in the third. The loss is considerably more with coarse and\r\ndamp samples. When the grain is steeped this dormant vitality gives\r\nplace to that complicated series of processes comprised under the\r\ngeneral term germination. When germination begins, enzymes are secreted,\r\nand these act on the reserve materials, starch and proteïns of the\r\nendosperm, converting them into simpler compounds, capable of diffusing\r\nto various parts of the growing germ. Following this, starch and\r\nproteïns are re-formed, the former being deposited in the tissues of the\r\ngerm and in the cells of the scutellum, which previously were almost\r\nfree from starch; the proteïn matter deposited in the latter disappears\r\nto a considerable extent, and the protoplasmic content of the cells\r\nassumes a very granular appearance. The pointed mass of cells\r\nconstituting the root-sheath is pushed forward by the root which\r\nprotrudes through the base of the grain. It is at this stage that the\r\nbarley is said by the maltster to \"chit.\" After the first rootlet has\r\nbroken through the ends of the sheath, it is followed by others. The\r\ncotyledonary sheath begins to elongate on the third or fourth day of\r\ngermination and ruptures the true covering of the seed; it then grows\r\nupwards between this and the husk and forms the acrospire or \"spire\" of\r\nthe maltster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Section showing the aleurone layer.\r\n\r\n  g, Starch cells;\r\n  i, Aleurone layer;\r\n  k, Layers which collectively constitute the husk.\r\n\r\n[Figs. 5-7 from Sykes & Ling, _Principles and Practice of Brewing_\r\n(1907), Charles Griffin & Co., Ltd.]]\r\n\r\n  According to Brown and Morris, when the first rootlet is breaking\r\n  through the sheath, starch begins to appear in the tissues of the\r\n  grain, also in the protoplasm of those cells which are nearest the\r\n  epithelial layer, and it gradually invades the deeper-seated cells.\r\n  Further the cellulose walls of the endosperm, situated immediately\r\n  above the secretory layer, are partially dissolved, the dissolved\r\n  matter passing into the scutellum, there to be transformed into\r\n  starch. Brown and Morris state that this process gradually extends to\r\n  the cellulose walls of the endosperm, and until these are affected\r\n  there is no evidence of any solvent action on the starch granules\r\n  themselves. Thus according to these authors the first enzyme to be\r\n  formed is one which dissolves cell walls, and it was consequently\r\n  termed by them a \"cytohydrolyst.\" They assert further that the\r\n  so-called mealy or modified condition, which the maltster desires to\r\n  bring about to the fullest degree, depends on the extent to which the\r\n  cell walls have been affected, and they enter into a minute\r\n  description of the entire disappearance of these during the malting\r\n  process. On the other hand, J. Grüss has pointed out that the action\r\n  which takes place on the cell walls of the endosperm during\r\n  germination does not consist in their complete solution. Schulze has\r\n  shown that these cell walls consist of two carbohydrates, an araban\r\n  and a xylan. Grüss states that the araban is completely dissolved,\r\n  whilst the xylan is more or less unattacked. The cell walls become,\r\n  however, transparent so that they can only be seen in sections which\r\n  have been stained; Brown and Morris examined unstained sections. The\r\n  writer (A. R. Ling) has proved that the cell wall is present in the\r\n  most friable and well modified finished malt.\r\n\r\n_Condition._--Barley is bought in the open market solely on the evidence\r\nof certain external signs, and judgment can only be acquired by long\r\nexperience. The corns should be plump, even in size, and the colour\r\nshould be uniform from end to end. The sample should have a sweet\r\nodour, and it should be dry to the touch. The presence of light or\r\nweevilled corns may be detected by the fact that they float in water.\r\nCareless threshing or dressing is responsible for much damage done to\r\nbarley. In this way many of the corns may be broken, have the palcae\r\npartly stripped off or portions removed along with the awn. All broken\r\nand dead corns are prone to become mouldy on the malting floors, the\r\ncontagion thus presented becoming general. E. R. Moritz drew attention\r\nin 1895 to the ill effects of close dressing, and more recently (1905)\r\nthe matter has been brought before the Highland and Agricultural\r\nSociety, chiefly through Montagu Baird, who with C. H. Babington was\r\ninstrumental in inducing the Board of Agriculture to publish a leaflet\r\nrecommending more careful methods of threshing barley. Close dressing\r\nwas at one time practised as a means of raising the bushel weight, and\r\nthus giving a fictitious value to the barley. Immature barley feels cold\r\nto the hand, has a greenish-yellow colour, and, when dry, a starved\r\nwrinkled appearance. Over-ripeness in barley is distinguished by a white\r\ndead appearance of the corn. Mature or dry grains slip through the\r\nfingers more readily than unripe or damp ones. The contents of the\r\nendosperm should present a white friable or mealy appearance when the\r\ncorns are bitten or cut in two with a penknife. The condition of the\r\ngrain may be determined by means of a mechanical cutter, which cuts a\r\ncertain number of corns (fifty or more) at one time. Some cutters are\r\nconstructed to cut the corns transversely, others to cut them\r\nlongitudinally. The so-called transparency test may be used for the same\r\npurpose. It is carried out in an apparatus known as the diaphanoscope,\r\nwhich consists of a box fitted with a sliding tray, furnished with a\r\ncertain number of shuttle-shaped holes (usually 500), each of such a\r\nsize as just to hold a barleycorn longitudinally. Into the portion of\r\nthe box below this tray an electric lamp is placed, and the corns are\r\nlooked at from above. Thoroughly mealy corns are opaque, whilst steely\r\ncorns are transparent. When certain portions of a corn are steely, these\r\npresent the appearance of lakes. By this means the percentage of mealy,\r\nsteely, or half steely corns in a sample may readily be estimated.\r\n\r\n  E. Prior points out that steeliness of barley is of two kinds, one of\r\n  which disappears after the grain has been steeped and dried, and\r\n  therefore does not necessarily influence the malting value of the\r\n  sample, and the other which is permanent, and therefore retards the\r\n  modification of the corn. He proposed to determine what he called the\r\n  coefficient of mellowness of a sample of barley by means of the\r\n  formula:--\r\n\r\n        (M1 - M)100\r\n    A = ----------- + M,\r\n          100 - M\r\n\r\n  in which A is the degree of mellowness, M is the percentage of mealy\r\n  corns in the original barley, and M1 is the percentage of mealy corns\r\n  after steeping and drying the barley. Prior points out that, generally\r\n  speaking, the degree of mellowness varies inversely as the proteïn\r\n  content.\r\n\r\n  The physical differences between steely and mealy grains were first\r\n  investigated by Johansen, who arrived at the conclusion that mealiness\r\n  is always accompanied by the presence of air spaces in the endosperm.\r\n  Munro and Beaven confirmed and extended this. Their conclusions are as\r\n  follow: \"Mealy grains have a lower specific gravity than steely\r\n  grains, and contain a larger amount of interstitial air. The total\r\n  nitrogen content of mealy grains is less than that of steely grains.\r\n  Steely grains contain a relatively high proportion of nitrogenous\r\n  substances soluble (a) in 5% salt solution, and (b) in alcohol of\r\n  specific gravity 0.9. Mealy barley modifies better than steely during\r\n  germination. The process of drying damp and under-matured barley\r\n  intact at 100° F. produced an apparent mellowing or maturation. Other\r\n  things being equal, maturation, which is physiologically a\r\n  post-ripening process, is correlated with the mealy appearance of the\r\n  endosperm.\" H. T. Brown and his collaborators point out that thin\r\n  sections of steely corns when examined under the microscope no longer\r\n  exhibit a translucent appearance, but show the mealy properties as\r\n  completely as if they had been cut from a mealy grain, and they\r\n  suggest that in a steely corn the whole of the endosperm is under a\r\n  state of tensile stress which cannot be maintained in the thin\r\n  sections. If, however, a thin section of a steely barley be cemented\r\n  to a slide with Canada balsam and then pared away with a razor,\r\n  steeliness and translucency may be preserved even in the thinnest\r\n  sections. The mealy appearance in the endosperm of barley is assumed\r\n  to be a direct consequence of the formation of interspaces around the\r\n  cell-contents and within the cell walls. Under ordinary conditions it\r\n  is conjectured that these interspaces are filled with air, but it is\r\n  pointed out that they can also be produced under circumstances which\r\n  suggest that they are at times vacuous or partly so. According to the\r\n  last-mentioned authors they appear to originate from a system of\r\n  stresses and strains induced within the endosperm by its gradual loss\r\n  of water, a break of continuity taking place which gives rise to these\r\n  interspaces when the cohesive power of the heterogeneous cell-contents\r\n  falls below a certain point. It is further suggested by them that the\r\n  most important factor in producing the stresses and strains is\r\n  probably the shrinkage of the starch granules as their water content\r\n  is reduced from, say, 40 to about 15%. It is pointed out, however,\r\n  that actual discontinuity in the cell-contents can only take place\r\n  when the tensile strength of the protoplasmic matrix in which the\r\n  starch granules are embedded has been surpassed, and this being so it\r\n  might be anticipated that those cells which contain the larger amount\r\n  of proteïn material would probably best resist the internal stresses\r\n  and strains, a deduction in close agreement with observed facts,\r\n  steely grains being as a rule richer in proteïn than mealy grains.\r\n  Brown and his co-workers determine the coefficient of mealiness of a\r\n  barley as follows: Five hundred corns are cut transversely in a corn\r\n  cutter and the percentage of mealy, half mealy and steely corns is\r\n  noted. The number 100 is taken to represent complete mealiness, 1\r\n  complete steeliness, and 50 the intermediate class. If the percentage\r\n  of each class be multiplied by its special value, and the sum of the\r\n  products divided by 100, the result is the coefficient of mealiness.\r\n  By steeping and drying a very steely Scottish barley, the coefficient\r\n  of mealiness was raised from 29.7 to 87.1, whilst concurrently the\r\n  specific gravity fell from 1.417 to 1.289.\r\n\r\nBarley even of the same kind varies widely in its chemical composition,\r\nbut on an average the proximate constituents of British malting barleys\r\nbe within the following limits:--\r\n\r\n  Moisture                                  18  --12   per cent.\r\n  Nitrogenous matters expressed as proteïns  8  --15      \"\r\n  Fat                                        2  -- 2.5    \"\r\n  Starch                                    60  --65      \"\r\n  Sugars                                     1.5-- 2.0    \"\r\n  Gums                                       1.7-- 2.0    \"\r\n  Fibre (cellulose)                          5  -- 7      \"\r\n  Ash                                        2  -- 2.5    \"\r\n\r\nAny sample of barley which contains more than 20% of moisture would be\r\nconsidered damp. The late Professor Lintner expressed the view several\r\nyears ago that a good malting barley should not contain more than 10% of\r\nproteïn, but R. Wahl asserts that in America six-rowed barleys\r\ncontaining a far higher percentage of proteïn are used successfully,\r\nindeed preferably, for malting purposes. The only precise knowledge we\r\npossess of the proteïn compounds of barley is due to the researches of\r\nT. B. Osborne. According to this observer, barley contains the\r\nunder-mentioned compounds of this class in the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Soluble in water / Leucosin (albumin) \\        0.30 per cent.\r\n                   \\ Proteose           /\r\n  Soluble in salt solution: Edestin (globulin)   1.95    \"\r\n  Soluble in 75% alcohol /  Hordeïn              4.00    \"\r\n                         \\  Insoluble proteïn    4.50    \"\r\n                                                -----\r\n        Total                                   10.75    \"\r\n\r\n  It should be pointed out here that the above are only average values\r\n  for the particular samples of barley investigated. Undoubtedly the\r\n  nitrogenous constituents of different barleys vary widely in nature as\r\n  well as in amount.\r\n\r\nRaw barley contains enzymes, thus diastase of translocation, so called\r\nby Horace T. Brown and G. H. Morris, and catalase (H. van Laer).\r\nProteolytic enzymes appear only to arise with the beginning of\r\ngermination; but it has been asserted that raw barley contains\r\nproenzymes (zymogens), which can be rendered active by treatment with\r\ndilute lactic acid at an appropriate temperature. The action of the\r\ndiastase of raw barley on starch has been studied by Julian L. Baker.\r\n\r\nBarley should not be cut until it is properly ripe, but over-ripeness is\r\nmuch more to be guarded against by the maltster than premature cutting,\r\nas it is accompanied by a loss in germinative power. Moreover, unripe\r\ncorn may to a certain extent be matured in stack, whilst a great\r\nimprovement in germinative capacity is frequently produced by sweating.\r\nVery wet seasons are prejudicial to the ripening of the grain, and when\r\nthe latter is stacked in too moist a condition it is apt to become what\r\nis known as mow burnt. Especially is this the case with barleys\r\ncontaining large percentages of nitrogen and of high enzymatic\r\nactivities. Such barleys are denoted \"warm\" by M. Delbrück from their\r\ntendency to heat when stored in a moist condition. The effect of this\r\nheating is exhibited in the corns becoming black and discoloured at the\r\ntips; they are then said to be magpied. Even in an otherwise dry season\r\na large amount of rain during harvest causes the corns to become\r\n\"weathered,\" whilst some of them begin germinating and rot. At the same\r\ntime heavy dews at night whilst the barley lies cut in the field, or\r\neven a sprinkling of rain, assists in mellowing the grain, which often\r\nin consequence works the more freely on the malting floors. Properly\r\nharvested barley is all the better for remaining in stack for two or\r\nthree months, as was the practice in former years; if, however, it has\r\nbeen stacked too wet the sooner it is broken down the better.\r\n\r\n  It is difficult to give any specific test for ripeness, but a series\r\n  of observations has been made by H. T. Brown and F. Escombe. Samples\r\n  of barley were taken from the field on the 20th, 24th and 29th of\r\n  July, and on the 2nd, 6th and 10th of August, and preserved in spirit\r\n  so that they remained in the same state as when they were gathered.\r\n  Sections were then cut of these corns, when it was found that the\r\n  progress of maturation is attended by deformation and ultimate\r\n  disintegration of the cell nuclei. The change which is denoted by the\r\n  term nuclear senescence is said to begin in the starch-containing\r\n  cells, near the periphery of the corn, immediately underlying the\r\n  layer next to the aleurone layer. This deformation is followed by\r\n  complete disintegration of the nucleus, and at the end of seven or\r\n  eight days nearly the whole of the endosperm has been involved. Brown\r\n  and Escombe state that when this nuclear test is properly applied it\r\n  stamps as immature those corns in a sample which are manifestly unripe\r\n  owing to premature desiccation as well as those in which the ratio of\r\n  nitrogen to carbohydrate is unduly high, owing to an excess of\r\n  nitrogenous manure in the soil, or to sparser sowing with its\r\n  consequent reduction of root competition. This method, interesting\r\n  though it be, is not fitted for practical use, and the agriculturist\r\n  must rely as heretofore upon empirical methods for deciding whether or\r\n  not the grain has attained ripeness or maturity.\r\n\r\n  The bushel weight is a useful criterion in arriving at an opinion\r\n  regarding the value of a sample of barley; but in basing judgment upon\r\n  this factor regard must be paid to the fact already mentioned that if\r\n  the grains be dressed closely the bushel weight is increased. The\r\n  reason of this is that with the removal of the awns the corns pack\r\n  more closely together. The best British malting barleys should weigh\r\n  52-56 lb. per bushel, the standard weight for malting barleys being 56\r\n  lb.\r\n\r\nDuring the storage of barley access of air is necessary, otherwise the\r\ngrain dies from asphyxiation. Sound barley after being kiln-dried\r\nretains its vitality for a number of years; but the statement that the\r\ncorns found in the Egyptian mummy cases, in which they had remained for\r\nseveral thousands of years, were still capable of germination, is\r\ncontrary to modern experience. Moisture must also be carefully excluded,\r\nas it initiates germination in a few cells only of the endosperm and\r\ncauses heating. A constant repetition of wetting such as may take place\r\non account of alterations of the atmospheric temperature, which causes\r\nmoisture to be deposited, in the form of dew, may ultimately destroy the\r\nvitality and foster the growth and development of mould fungi which\r\nusually grow on broken and damaged corns. In this connexion the\r\nadvantage of screening and sweating of barley before storing it will be\r\napparent (see below).\r\n\r\n  An immense amount of damage is caused to the grain, during storage, by\r\n  various insects, one of the most destructive of these being the common\r\n  weevil (_Calandra granaria_). When fully developed this insect\r\n  measures (1/6)th to (1/8)th of an inch in length, and is of a bright\r\n  chestnut colour. The larvae are fleshy legless grubs, shorter than the\r\n  perfect insect, with a series of tubercles along each side of the\r\n  body; the head is round with strong jaws. The pupa is white, clear and\r\n  transparent, showing the form of the future weevil. The female bores a\r\n  hole in the grain with her snout and deposits an egg. The larva when\r\n  hatched lives on the contents of the grain and undergoes its changes\r\n  therein. Windisch asserts that only barley which has ripened in the\r\n  granary is attacked by weevil. Grain which is only slightly attacked\r\n  should be kilned at a temperature of 122° F., which destroys the\r\n  weevil in all stages of development. To detect weevil in a sample of\r\n  barley, the grain should be spread out on a sheet of white paper in\r\n  bright sunlight. If weevils are present they soon appear, and betake\r\n  themselves to a position outside the sunlight, to which they are\r\n  averse. Treatment of the grain with carbon bisulphide has been\r\n  suggested as a means of destroying weevil; even if efficacious,\r\n  however, such a process could not be recommended on account of its\r\n  danger, carbon bisulphide being highly inflammable. The only practical\r\n  means of ridding a granary or shop of weevil is to clear out all the\r\n  grain and leave it empty for a year or more.\r\n\r\nThe vitality of barley may be determined by causing a sample to\r\ngerminate in any of the well-known forms of apparatus devised for that\r\npurpose, and counting the percentage of germinating and idle corns. The\r\ngerminative capacity of a sample of barley may frequently be raised by\r\nsweating (see below), which, as already mentioned, brings about a kind\r\nof artificial maturation.\r\n\r\n_Malting._--There are two systems of malting used in England: floor\r\nmalting and pneumatic or drum malting. These systems will be described\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nA floor malting consists of a rectangular building of several storeys,\r\nhaving the cisterns at one end and the kilns at the other. The uppermost\r\nfloor is devoted to barley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Longitudinal section of 200 quarter malting at\r\nMortlake. (Julian L. Baker, architect.)]\r\n\r\n  Figure 8 shows a longitudinal section of Messrs Watney, Combe, Reid &\r\n  Co.'s 200 quarter malting at Mortlake. The barley is carried to the\r\n  top of the building by the elevator A, where the screening and\r\n  dressing machinery is situated. After leaving these machines the grain\r\n  is conveyed on bands to the barley floors B and C. The floor C\r\n  contains also the steeping cisterns. The six working floors are D, E,\r\n  F, G, H, K. The floors are ventilated by louvres, N, N, N. The\r\n  cisterns are connected to the floors by means of plugs. The \"pieces,\"\r\n  as they are termed, of germinating barley are gradually worked along\r\n  the floors to the kilns M, M, on to which they are loaded by rotary\r\n  bands. The fire-places O, O, are arranged so that the draught may be\r\n  easily controlled. The hot air and products of combustion pass up the\r\n  shafts P, P, to the hot-air chamber R, R, where they strike the baffle\r\n  plates S, S. These plates disperse the hot air and gases evenly\r\n  beneath the kiln floors T, T, through the green malt. After drying and\r\n  curing, the malt is allowed to cool and is then carried by bands to\r\n  the floor U, where by suitable machinery the coombs or rootlets are\r\n  removed. The finished malt is stored in the bins V, V, V.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the malting the barley has to be put through the following\r\noperations seriatim: receiving, hoisting and weighing, rough screening,\r\ndrying and sweating, storing until required for use, screening, grading\r\nand removing broken corns, steeping, couching, flooring, withering,\r\ndrying and curing, dressing and polishing, storing, weighing, sacking\r\nand discharging the finished malt.\r\n\r\nIn sweating barley the temperature should not be allowed to rise above\r\n120° F.; it is usually conducted at 100° F.; and subsequently the barley\r\nshould be stored for some weeks before it is steeped.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of a malting is described by the number of quarters which\r\nare put through it every four days. A fifty quarter malting does not\r\nmerely mean that the cisterns have a capacity of fifty quarters, but\r\nthat this quantity of barley goes through the house every four days. The\r\naverage time the germinating barley is on the floors is twelve days,\r\nand, as a rule, kilning occupies four days. If, as sometimes happens,\r\nthe malt has to be kept on the floors thirteen, fourteen, fifteen days,\r\nor even longer, the malting is not being worked at the capacity under\r\nwhich it is described, and the kilns may remain unused for a day or\r\nmore. Conversely, when the malt is loaded at less than twelve days, a\r\nday or two has to be missed in steeping. In the former case when the\r\nkilns are not being used for drying and curing malt, advantage may be\r\ntaken to utilize them for sweating barley.\r\n\r\nSteeping cisterns were formerly rectangular vessels, of slate, brick or\r\ncement, from which the barley had to be discharged by shovelling it out.\r\nThe forms approved most at the present day are conical and constructed\r\nof iron; they have arrangements at the apex of the cone, the lower\r\nportion, for discharging the grain by gravitation. The steeping period\r\nranges from 48 to 70 hours; it varies according to the kind of barley,\r\nand the time of the year. In some of the older maltings there are no\r\narrangements for heating the steep water, and in the winter steeping has\r\noccasionally to be performed with water at a temperature near its\r\nfreezing-point. Steeping should be carried out at a temperature as near\r\nas possible to 55° and not higher than 60° F. The usual practice is to\r\nfill the cistern up to a certain height with water and throw the barley\r\ninto it, stirring it until it is about level; the heavy corns will then\r\nsink directly to the bottom, whilst the light corns and refuse float on\r\nthe surface and may be skimmed off. During the time the barley remains\r\nin the cistern it is usual to change the steep water two or three times,\r\ngenerally at intervals of twelve hours or tides. The advantage of this\r\nis not merely to keep the grain fresh and sweet, but to bring it into\r\ncontact with the air during the time it is taking up water. Aëration of\r\nthe steep has long been recognized in Germany as promoting germination,\r\nand several arrangements are on the market enabling air to be passed\r\nthrough the grain while it is in the cistern. It has been recommended by\r\nGraham, Stopes, Moritz and Morris, and experimental evidence as to its\r\nbeneficial effects has been published by Windisch, Bleisch, Will, and\r\nBaker and Dick. When the corn is steep ripe it contains some 60% of\r\nwater. Steeping does not consist, however, merely in the imbibition of\r\na certain amount of water; in order to bring about germination this\r\nwater must remain within the corn a certain length of time. Thus,\r\nalthough it is quite possible to force the necessary amount of water\r\ninto the grain in less than the 48-70 hours usually taken up by the\r\nsteeping process, the grain is not steep-ripe until certain changes\r\ninitiated by the water have taken place, and these require time for\r\ntheir completion. The following average data are useful to remember in\r\nconnexion with the steeping process:--\r\n\r\n  Amount of water in steep-ripe barley (about) 60%.\r\n  Matter removed from barley during steeping (about) 1.5%.\r\n  Increase in volume of barley due to water absorption (about) 18-20%.\r\n\r\n  There has been much discussion as to the influence of saline matters\r\n  in water on the steeping process. The late Professor Lintner stated\r\n  that common salt in water tended to extract the nitrogenous\r\n  constituents of the grain, but impeded its germination. Mills and\r\n  Pettigrew found that waters containing calcium salts extracted a\r\n  minimum of nitrogenous compounds from the barley; they also came to\r\n  the conclusion that the esteem in which the Lichfield water is held\r\n  for steeping purposes is due to the presence of nitrates which, they\r\n  assert, have a stimulating effect on the subsequent germination of the\r\n  grain. The writer has added lime-water to the extent of one-third of\r\n  the total volume of water at the first change, believing it to promote\r\n  regularity of germination. Bearing in mind, however, the observations\r\n  of Adrian J. Brown, that the barleycorn is enclosed in a membrane\r\n  permeable to water but impermeable to most salts, it is difficult to\r\n  see how the saline constituents of water can have any effect except in\r\n  removing matter from the external portions of the grain and on those\r\n  corns which are broken. The apparent beneficial effect of lime-water\r\n  in the steep is probably entirely due to the removal of matters from\r\n  the husks or paleae.\r\n\r\nMalting floors may be constructed of cement, tiles or slate, the two\r\nformer being preferable to the latter. Ford, in 1849, recommended 200\r\nsq. ft. per quarter of barley steeped as the area of the working floors,\r\nand he was quite convinced of the necessity of allowing ample floor\r\nroom, so that the grain could be worked on the slow, cool system.\r\nSubsequently, however, maltsters reduced their floor area, and put the\r\ngrain rapidly through the malting, thus producing what is termed\r\n\"forced\" malt. This kind of malt was, however, condemned by practical\r\nbrewers, and a chemical test whereby forcing could be detected having\r\nbeen devised by E. R. Moritz and G. H. Morris, maltsters have been\r\ncompelled again to increase the area of their working floors. At the\r\npresent time the approved area may be placed at 175-200 sq. ft. per\r\nquarter of barley steeped. The area is, however, largely ruled by the\r\nkind of barley to be malted.\r\n\r\nAfter the barley has been thrown out of the cistern it is made up in a\r\nrectangular heap 16-20 in. deep, called the \"couch\"; the object of this\r\nis to enable it to gather heat and so start germinating. It usually\r\nremains in couch for 12-24 hours, until in fact the interior portion of\r\nthe heap registers a temperature of about 60° F. During the days of the\r\nmalt tax the exciseman gauged the quantity of the barley while it was in\r\nthe couch. After couching the barley is spread thinly and evenly on the\r\nfloor, forming what is known as the young floor or No. 1 piece. The\r\nfirst visible sign of germination is the sprouting of the rootlet,\r\ntermed \"chitting,\" and this occurs either while the grain is on the\r\ncouch or on the young floor. As already mentioned, it may be quickened\r\nby aerating the grain in the cistern. From the time the barley is first\r\ncast out of the cistern up to the stage of the young floor, or No. 1\r\npiece, it has a pleasant ethereal odour resembling apples. Drs Thomson,\r\nHope and Coventry stated in the earlier part of the 19th century that\r\nthey distilled \"spirits\" from germinating barley at this stage. In the\r\nlight of our present knowledge it would not be surprising if alcoholic\r\nfermentation were proved to occur within the grain at this stage, since\r\nintramolecular or anaerobic respiration in certain vegetables has been\r\nfound to be due to alcoholic fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe thickness at which the young floor is spread depends upon the\r\noutside temperature and the nature of the barley. If the weather be\r\nwarm, or if there be a tendency for the barley to heat, the piece must\r\nbe spread all the thinner. At this stage the grain loses its external\r\nwet appearance. When spread too thickly the grain will begin to sweat,\r\nand the rootlets will be thrown out suddenly and unevenly. As a rule,\r\nunder these circumstances, the rootlets will be long and thin, when they\r\nare said to be \"wild.\" A piece which has been allowed to get into this\r\ncondition must at once be spread thinner. If the sweating has not\r\ncontinued long, the harm done may be confined to increased loss by\r\nrespiration. The young floor is usually turned with a plough twice\r\nduring twelve hours, and it may be forked between whiles, but no hard\r\nand fast rule can be laid down as to when this is necessary; it must be\r\nleft to the maltster's judgment, as it depends entirely on what is going\r\non within the grain. The object of turning is in the first place to\r\naerate the grain and freshen it, secondly to check excessive rise of\r\ntemperature, and thirdly to promote evenness of growth. Too frequent\r\nturning is not to be advised. After remaining four days on the young\r\nfloor three or four rootlets should have appeared, and the acrospire\r\nshould have begun to grow up the back of the corn. The apple-like odour\r\nof the piece then gives place to one resembling that of the common rush,\r\nand this should continue the whole time that the malt remains on the\r\nfloor. On the fifth day the piece is next moved to No. 2 position, a\r\nstage nearer the kiln. It is here that sprinkling is resorted to when\r\nnecessary. The amount of sprinkling and the time it is given cannot be\r\nexactly prescribed. The amount may vary from two to five gallons per\r\nquarter, and it should only be given when the rootlets, which ought to\r\nbe short and curly, and five or more in number, show signs of losing\r\ntheir freshness. If an excessive amount of sprinkling be given forced\r\ngrowth ensues. It is preferable not to add the whole of the water at one\r\ntime, but to divide it over two lots; and immediately after the piece\r\nhas been sprinkled it should be thoroughly and carefully mixed,\r\notherwise some of the grain will receive an undue proportion of water.\r\nWhen all the sprinkling water has been given to the piece, which as a\r\nrule should not be done later than at the sixth or seventh day of\r\nflooring, the temperature should be kept down to about 55° F. by\r\nturning. Too frequent turning may, however, detach the rootlet, and it\r\nmay cause the grain to lose its vitality prematurely, so that growth of\r\nthe acrospire stops.\r\n\r\nBy about the eighth day of flooring the acrospire should be about\r\nthree-quarters up the corn. After this the germinating corn is moved\r\nforward to No. 3 piece, which is at first spread as thinly on the floors\r\nas in the previous pieces. Here it gradually dries and incipient\r\nwithering of the rootlets sets in. The only treatment which is now given\r\nto the grain is to heap it up thicker and thicker by degrees until it is\r\nready for loading on the kiln. This increase in thickness of the piece\r\n(now called the old piece) should not be too sudden, especially if the\r\ngrain be fresh in appearance and contain a large quantity of water. When\r\nthe piece is thickened up to say 10 in. in depth, while it is in a very\r\nmoist condition, heating and sweating take place, with additional growth\r\nof acrospire and rootlet. Under such forcing conditions a large\r\nproduction of sugar and degradation of the proteïns will take place.\r\nWhen, however, the moisture has been gradually reduced before thickening\r\nup, the rootlet dies off; and although increase of temperature may\r\noccur, this is accompanied by little or no further growth of the\r\nacrospire, action being confined to the mellowing of the grain by the\r\nenzymes. When the malt is ready for loading on the kiln it should be\r\npossible to break down the contents of each corn between the thumb and\r\nfinger. Opinions differ as to what the final temperature on the\r\nwithering floor should be. If the moisture content of the malt be about\r\n50%, the piece must be kept thin to avoid sweating. But under these\r\nconditions mellowing does not occur, hence the necessity of reducing the\r\nmoisture content gradually after the last sprinkling water has been\r\ngiven. When the process has been conducted properly the temperature of\r\nthe old piece may be allowed to rise as high as 70° F. during the six\r\nhours previous to loading. The moisture content of the green malt when\r\nloaded should not be much above 40%.\r\n\r\nThe endosperm of green malt which is ready for the kiln should be soft\r\nand mealy, and should not exude moisture when pressed between the\r\nthumb-nails, but should crumble and disintegrate to a chalky mass having\r\nlittle or no adhesiveness.\r\n\r\n  The foregoing observations are not to be regarded as hard and fast\r\n  rules, but they are simply intended to give some indications of the\r\n  malting process when it proceeds on normal lines; it may be that on\r\n  account of the presence of damaged corns the piece begins to develop\r\n  mould by about the tenth day, and it then has to be kept thin and\r\n  sometimes even loaded on kiln prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe malt made for grain distillers, in which a high diastatic activity\r\nis required, is manufactured on quite different lines from those above\r\nindicated. It is often sprinkled late, and loaded on kiln often in a\r\nsodden condition. In some cases sprinkling on kiln is resorted to, but\r\nit is doubtful if this leads to the desired object. Other things being\r\nequal, the smaller the corns--i.e. the greater number of embryos in a\r\ngiven weight--the higher the diastatic activity of the malt. In\r\nselecting a barley for the production of highly diastatic malt, the\r\ndiastatic power of the original raw grain is a factor of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_Kilning._--When loaded on kiln, malt intended for brewing ale and stout\r\nis, if properly withered, in a moribund condition; nevertheless, during\r\nthe first stages of the kilning process a certain amount of vital\r\nactivity is manifested, and the malt undergoes mellowing by the action\r\nof enzymes on the contents of the endosperm. If the malt be loaded while\r\nthe rootlets appear fresh on account of the presence of too much\r\nmoisture, rapid growth of the acrospire ensues, giving rise to overshot\r\ncorns, known in Germany as \"hussars.\" To check this the moisture must be\r\nrapidly removed by the passage of large volumes of air through the malt.\r\nBut under such circumstances mellowing does not occur. The ideal\r\nconditions of kilning are when the malt has been properly withered on\r\nthe floors before loading, and, assuming that drying and curing occupy\r\nfour days, that 25-30% of the moisture be removed very gradually, this\r\noccupying the first three days, at the end of which the malt is said to\r\nbe hand-dry. The thickness at which the malt is spread on the kiln\r\nshould not exceed 7-8 in., and until hand-dry (that is to say, reduced\r\nto a moisture content of 12-15%) it should not be turned; if moved at\r\nall (and that only is necessary when reek occurs), it should only be\r\nlightly forked. The rate at which the temperature is raised depends\r\nlargely on the kind of malt to be made and the construction of the kiln.\r\nIf high flavour and colour are required, these are produced by keeping\r\nthe malt for several hours near a temperature of 160° F. while it still\r\ncontains 12-15% of moisture. If more than this amount of moisture be\r\npresent when the temperature reaches the limit just mentioned, the\r\nconditions known as stewing would obtain, with the result that \"forced\"\r\nmalt would be produced. A certain amount of colour is produced at the\r\nfinal temperature to which the malt is raised; but when such means are\r\nrelied upon for the production of the greater part of the colour,\r\nreduction of extract and deficiency of flavour follow, the colour being\r\nthen almost exclusively the result of caramelization of the\r\ncarbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe so-called curing stage constitutes the last part of the kilning\r\nprocess, and the malt must then be turned frequently to ensure\r\nuniformity of action. Mechanical turners are exceedingly useful for this\r\npurpose. Curing in a drum, as in the so-called pneumatic malting process\r\n(see below), also effects satisfactory curing.\r\n\r\n  The following table will give an idea of the kilning temperatures\r\n  usually employed for the three kinds of malt mentioned, but it must be\r\n  remembered that these temperatures are largely regulated by the\r\n  construction of the kiln and the amount of draught available. In this\r\n  connexion it may be mentioned that the final curing temperature is not\r\n  necessarily a criterion of the tint of the malt. A malt may have been\r\n  finished off at a very high temperature and still be a pale malt,\r\n  provided the moisture percentage has been sufficiently reduced in the\r\n  initial stages of kilning.\r\n\r\n                                     Running\r\n                    Pale Malt.

Sucrose also augments in the\r\naleurone layer, but starch is never formed in the aleurone cells. These\r\nchanges occur when the malt is first loaded on kiln; indeed, at no part\r\nof the malting process is there greater physiological activity.\r\n\r\nKilning has been specially studied by J. Grüss, who divides the process\r\ninto four stages, the first being that at which the temperature limit is\r\n113° F. It is characterized by a continuation of the living processes,\r\nespecially growth of the acrospire, which, as already stated, proceeds\r\ntoo far if the malt be loaded too wet. In any case the rootlet dies\r\naway. The metabolism of the carbohydrates already mentioned is\r\naccompanied by that of the nitrogenous constituents, the reserve proteïn\r\nof the sub-aleurone layer being attacked by proteolytic enzymes and\r\nbroken down into simpler compounds. This is a most important matter from\r\nthe point of view of the brewing value of barley, for the degradation\r\nproducts of the proteïns are necessary constituents of wort as yeast\r\nfood. Moreover, unless proper modification of these proteïn bodies\r\noccurs it is impossible to produce tender malt. A barley which contains\r\na high percentage of reserve proteïn is as a rule unfitted for malting\r\npurposes, and indeed, the higher the proteïn content the greater the\r\ndifficulty the maltster experiences in dealing with it. Proteïn\r\nhydrolysis requires the presence of a certain amount of moisture, and if\r\nthis be removed too rapidly by a forced draught at the early stages of\r\nkilning the proteolytic enzymes cannot perform their function. If, on\r\nthe other hand, the grain be loaded in too moist a condition, and the\r\ntemperature be raised too quickly, the proteolytic enzymes lose their\r\nactivity and the proteïns remain for the most part unattacked. When\r\ngermination is allowed to proceed on the kiln too great degradation of\r\nthe proteïn occurs, and the malt is liable to produce fretty beers, on\r\naccount of the presence of an excessive amount of nitrogenous nutritive\r\nmatter, which leads to the development of disease organisms.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of the kilning process, according to Grüss, is that at\r\nwhich the temperatures range from 113° to 167° F. The life of the corn\r\nis now suspended, but enzymatic processes continue. The starch is\r\nfurther saccharified, and the dividing line of the aleurone layer at the\r\nfurrow is attacked, as are also the cell walls of the endosperm, which\r\nare still intact, these being partially converted into gummy substances.\r\nThis change, however, also requires the presence of a certain amount of\r\nmoisture. If too much air be passed through the malt at this stage the\r\nabove-named dividing partition of the cell walls is not attacked. The\r\nair may expand the grain to some extent and produce malt of a low bushel\r\nweight, which, however, is not properly modified and cannot give\r\nsatisfactory results in practice.\r\n\r\nDuring the third stage of kilning, an enzyme, which Grüss claims to have\r\nrecognized, and which he denotes spermoxidase, is said to exert its\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nSchönfeld has confirmed the discoveries of Grüss by practical\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n  _Fuel._--The fuel used for drying and curing malt is either anthracite\r\n  or coke, and the greatest care is necessary in selecting it on account\r\n  of its liability to contain arsenic, which is to a greater or less\r\n  extent an invariable constituent of all coal. The fuel used for\r\n  malting purposes should not contain more arsenic than (1/20)th grain\r\n  per lb. Gas coke should on no account be used, unless it has been\r\n  proved to be sufficiently free from arsenic; but the best oven coke\r\n  frequently contains so little arsenic that it may be employed with\r\n  perfect safety, especially if it be mixed with a proportion (e.g. 5%)\r\n  of milk of lime, which retains the arsenic as calcium arsenate. In\r\n  Germany malt is, as a rule, dried and cured with hot air, whilst in\r\n  Great Britain the products of combustion are passed through the malt,\r\n  as it is believed that they exert a beneficial influence on the\r\n  flavour. The proportion of fuel used for drying and curing malt varies\r\n  according to the quality of the fuel and the construction of the kiln,\r\n  but on an average it may be placed at 50-80 lb. per quarter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  [From Sykes & Ling, _Principles and Practice of Brewing_ (1907),\r\n  Charles Griffin & Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 9.--Diagrammatic view of pneumatic malting, showing pneumatic\r\n  washing and steeping cisterns.]\r\n\r\n  _Storing._--After the malt has passed through the curing stage it is\r\n  generally heaped up for a few hours. This is believed to increase its\r\n  flavour. The malt is then stripped from the kiln, and the rootlets,\r\n  technically known as the coombs, are removed. Formerly this was\r\n  effected by workmen treading the malt, who wore heavy boots for the\r\n  purpose. At the present time, however, the rootlets are usually\r\n  removed by machinery, special forms of which have been devised for\r\n  this as well as for dressing and polishing the malt. It is the custom\r\n  of some maltsters to store malt with the rootlets still attached; but\r\n  this is an objectionable practice, since malt coombs attract moisture,\r\n  and the presence of more than 3% of moisture in malt produces the\r\n  condition known as \"slackness.\" When the malt is packed in bin it is\r\n  often covered with a layer of coombs, which then prevent access of\r\n  atmospheric moisture. Malt, to preserve its good qualities intact,\r\n  should be stored in bins made as nearly as possible air-tight, and it\r\n  should never be placed in bin until it is quite cool. It is probably\r\n  wrong to store malt in bins adjacent to the kilns, where it is kept at\r\n  a higher temperature than that of the surrounding atmosphere. During\r\n  storage of the malt a kind of mellowing occurs, the mechanism of which\r\n  is not understood. It is, however, known by practical brewers that the\r\n  best results cannot be obtained when new malt is used.\r\n\r\n  _Premature Malting._--Several years ago Galland suggested germinating\r\n  barley in a drum, his idea being to do away with handling of the\r\n  grain, and also to be independent of changes of atmospheric\r\n  temperature. The latest development of this system, the so-called\r\n  Galland-Henning process of pneumatic malting, has been improved by Mr\r\n  R. Blair Robertson, and a diagrammatic view of the interior of one of\r\n  these maltings, showing the drums and conical steeping cisterns, is\r\n  shown in fig. 9.\r\n\r\n  The drums are provided with a perforated channel for the passage of\r\n  air through the malt, which is packed in the annular space between\r\n  this channel and outside wall of the drum. Each drum is capable of\r\n  revolving on its axis, and there are arrangements for passing either\r\n  moist, saturated or dry air through the malt. The system as now\r\n  improved is capable of producing some of the best malt, especially if,\r\n  after germination has been completed in the drums, the green malt is\r\n  loaded on an ordinary kiln and the initial stages of kilning (see\r\n  above) conducted in the usual way; the curing, however, may be carried\r\n  out successfully in a special form of drum.\r\n\r\n  _Yield and Weight._--The malting process is attended with a certain\r\n  amount of loss of dry substance of the barley, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    In the steep                          1.5  to  2.0%\r\n    By respiration on floors and on kilns 3.0  \"   5.0%\r\n    Coombs                                3.0  \"   4.0%\r\n                                          ---     -----\r\n          Total                           7.5  \"  11.0%\r\n\r\n  In addition to this, barley, as already mentioned, contains from 15 to\r\n  20% of moisture, whereas finished malt contains 1 to 2%. The total\r\n  loss in weight which barley undergoes in the malting process may be\r\n  put down at from 17 to 28%. Since, however, malt is lighter than\r\n  barley (and the quantity of both was in former years measured\r\n  exclusively by volume), it frequently happens that a given number of\r\n  quarters of barley yields a larger number of quarters of finished\r\n  malt. When this happens it is usual to speak of an increase having\r\n  been obtained. At the present time weight replaces measure for both\r\n  barley and malt, and although it is usual to speak of the quantity of\r\n  grain in terms of quarters, what is meant is not the measured quarter,\r\n  but so many weighed standard quarters. The standard quarter for\r\n  English malting barley is 448 lb. and for malt 336 lb. From this it\r\n  will be seen that when a given number of weighed quarters of barley\r\n  yields the same number of quarters of finished malt, the actual yield\r\n  is 75%, and there is then said to be neither increase nor decrease. As\r\n  a rule, in practical working the yield of malt varies from a 4%\r\n  decrease to a 10% increase, corresponding to an actual yield on the\r\n  original barley of 72 to 82.5%.\r\n\r\n  J. Baverstock, an old writer, says that finished malt should weigh\r\n  one-fifth less than the barley from which it is produced. This\r\n  corresponds to a malting increase of about 7%, which is a high yield.\r\n  As a rule, foreign barley will give a greater malting increase than\r\n  English barley, because, on the one hand, the former usually contains\r\n  less moisture than the latter, and, further, because there is less\r\n  loss on the floors by respiration and rootlet growth.\r\n\r\n  The yield of malt from barley may be determined in the laboratory in\r\n  an extremely simple manner. Since every grain of barley must yield a\r\n  grain of malt, if we know the respective weights of a definite number\r\n  of barley and malt grains, provided that this number is large enough\r\n  to represent the average, then obviously this gives the data requisite\r\n  for calculating the yield of malt from barley. The number of corns the\r\n  weight of which is determined for this purpose is usually 1000, and if\r\n  the weight of this number be determined on several different 1000\r\n  corns, the average will closely approximate to the truth. Instead of\r\n  counting the corns by hand, an instrument may be used for this\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  If 1000 corns of a barley were found to weigh 42 grammes, and 1000\r\n  corns of a finished malt from the same barley 32 grammes, then the\r\n  yield of malt is (32 × 100)/42 = 76.1, this corresponding to a 1%\r\n  increase. Assuming that the moisture content of the barley was 15% and\r\n  that of the finished malt 2%, 100 grammes of malt will contain 2\r\n  grammes of moisture, and 76.1 grammes will contain (76.1 × 2)/100 =\r\n  1.5 grammes moisture; therefore 76.1 grammes of malt contain 76.1 -\r\n  1.5 = 74.6 grammes of dry matter. This was obtained from 100 - 15 = 85\r\n  grammes of barley dry substance. Hence 100 parts of barley dry\r\n  substance will yield (74.6 × 100)/85 = 87.7 corresponding with a loss\r\n  of dry substance equal to 12.5% of the dry substance of the barley, or\r\n  with a loss of 10.7% on the barley containing 15% of moisture.\r\n\r\n  The results obtained by this method of laboratory control when it is\r\n  accurately carried out agree very closely with those deduced from the\r\n  practical results of weighing the barley, malt and coombs in the\r\n  malting.\r\n\r\n  _Special Malts._--In addition to the kinds of malt considered in what\r\n  precedes, there are others mostly used for imparting specific flavours\r\n  and colour to beers and stout. These are crystal malt, imperial malt,\r\n  brown or blown malt, and black or roasted malt. Crystal malt is grown\r\n  for a shortened period on the floors, and then placed in a wire\r\n  cylinder, which is rotated over a fire so that it is dried at a very\r\n  high temperature. The weight per quarter is from 250 to 280 lb.\r\n  Imperial malt is dried off on an ordinary kiln at a final temperature\r\n  of 240-270° F., but it is not allowed the usual length of time on the\r\n  withering floor. It is placed on the drying kiln in a layer not\r\n  exceeding one inch and a half in thickness. A moderate heat from burnt\r\n  wood is first applied until the bulk of the moisture has been driven\r\n  off, when the temperature is suddenly raised so that the grains swell\r\n  some 25% and the malt takes up a strong empyreumatic flavour from the\r\n  products of combustion. This kind of malt weighs 270-300 lb. per\r\n  quarter. Black or roasted malt is prepared by roasting malt in a\r\n  cylinder. Ford states that perfectly malted corn gives a colour of\r\n  less intensity and permanence than does partially malted corn, and\r\n  this has been confirmed by other observers. A certain quantity of the\r\n  so-called black malt is actually made from raw barley, but this gives\r\n  a product of inferior flavour. The weight per quarter of black malt\r\n  varies as much as from 215 to 290 lb.\r\n\r\n  _Valuation._--For the valuation of malt the following determinations\r\n  are usually carried out: Extract per standard quarter, moisture,\r\n  diastatic activity by the Lintner process, tint, and matters soluble\r\n  in cold water. The physical examination of malt is also a matter of\r\n  importance, inasmuch as direct evidence is obtained thereby of the\r\n  modification of the malt. Among the methods adopted for this purpose\r\n  may be mentioned counting the percentage of corns in which the\r\n  acrospire has grown up to one-half, two-thirds and three-fourths the\r\n  entire length of the corn. In properly made malt the modification of\r\n  the endosperm should proceed _pari passu_ with the growth of the\r\n  acrospire. The sinker test is also useful when carried out in an\r\n  intelligent manner. Those corns which sink in water and lie flat are\r\n  improperly modified. Normal malt has a specific gravity less than\r\n  water and the corns have equal density throughout; consequently they\r\n  float horizontally in water. In forced samples the proximal ends are\r\n  frequently lighter than the distal ends, and the corns float\r\n  horizontally in water, with the germ directed upwards. The latter,\r\n  however, may in some cases fill with water, and the corns lie flat or\r\n  sink. This is a characteristic of over-modified malt. It will be seen\r\n  from these remarks that it is essential to carry out the sinker test\r\n  under standard conditions. The modification of the malt may also be\r\n  determined by means of the diaphanoscope already referred to under\r\n  Barley.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--M. M. W. Baird, _Journ. Inst.
