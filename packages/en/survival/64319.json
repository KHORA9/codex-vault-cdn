A Barbell._ _Elizabeth Albin Depictio\r\nJune 30. 1736._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The BARBEL_,\r\n\r\n\r\nCalled, in Icthyology, Barbus, but by some writers in Natural History,\r\nMustus Stuviatitis, and is a species of the Cyprinus. The Barbel is a\r\nfish commonly known and so called from the barb or beard under its chaps\r\nor nose, and is of the leather-mouthed kind.\r\n\r\nIt is but a moderate tasted fish, and the female is less esteemed for the\r\ntable than the male; but neither of them is much valued: the worst season\r\nfor them is in April. They love to be among the weirs, where there is a\r\nhard gravelly bottom, and generally swim together in large shoals.\r\n\r\nIn summer, they frequent the strongest and swiftest currents of water,\r\nas under deep bridges, weirs, and the like places, and are apt to get in\r\namong the piles, weeds, and other shelter; but in winter, they retire\r\ninto the deepest and stillest waters; the best season for angling for\r\nthis fish, is from May to August, and the time for taking them is very\r\nearly in the morning, or late in the evening. The place should be baited\r\nwith chopped worms some time before; and no bait is so good for the\r\nhook as the spawn of fish, particularly the Salmon: in defect of these,\r\nlob-worms will do; but they must be very clean and nice, and the hook\r\ncarefully covered, otherwise he will not touch them. Old cheese steeped\r\nin honey also is a fine bait.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cyprinus. Carpe. The Carp._ _Eleazar Albin delineavit\r\nDecem. 12. 1735._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CARP._\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonard Marchal first brought this fish into England about 1514: it is\r\nthe most valuable of all kinds of fish for stocking ponds, because of\r\nits quick growth and great increase. If the feeding and breeding of\r\nthis fish were more understood and practised, the advantages resulting\r\nwould be very great; and a fish pond would become as valuable an article\r\nas a garden. The gentleman who has land in his own hands, may, besides\r\nfurnishing his own table and supplying his friends, become a source of\r\nmuch profit in money, and very considerable advantage to his lands at the\r\nsame time, so as to make it produce more than by any other employment\r\nwhatever. The sale of Carp makes a considerable part of the revenue of\r\nthe principal nobility and gentry in Prussia, Pomerania, Brandenburg,\r\nSaxony, Mecklenburgh, Bohemia, and Holstein. Particular attention should\r\nbe paid to the soil, water, and situation of a Carp pond; the best kind\r\nare those which are surrounded by the finest pasture, or corn fields,\r\nwith a rich black mould, and soft springs on the spot, or other running\r\nwater, that is neither too cold, or impregnated with acid, calcareous,\r\nselenetic, or other seraneous, mineral particles. The water may be\r\nsoftened by exposing it to the air or sun in a reservoir, or by forming\r\nan open channel for it some distance from the pond; they should be\r\nexposed to the influence of the sun, and sheltered from the eastern and\r\nnortherly winds.\r\n\r\nBy experience, it is found convenient to have three kinds of ponds for\r\nCarp, viz. the spawning pond, the nursery, and the main pond: the first\r\npond must be cleared of all other kind of fish, especially those of\r\nthe rapacious kind, such as the perch, pike, eel, and trout; the water\r\nbeetle, and also of the newts or lizards. It should be exposed to sun\r\nand air, and be supplied with soft water. A pond of one acre requires\r\nthree or four male Carp, and six or eight female ones; and in the same\r\nproportion for each additional acre. The best Carp for breeding are\r\nthose of five, six, or seven years old, in good health, with full scale,\r\nand fine full eyes, and a long body, without any blemish or wound: the\r\npond should be stocked in a fine calm day, towards the end of March, or\r\nbeginning of April. Carp spawn in May, June, or July, according to the\r\nwarmth of the season; and for this purpose, they swim to a warm, shady,\r\nwell-sheltered place, where they gently rub their bodies against the\r\nsandy ground, grass, or osiers; and by this pressure the spawn issues\r\nout at the spawning season. All sorts of fowl should be kept from the\r\nponds: the young fry is hatched from the spawn by the genial influence of\r\nthe sun, and should be left in this pond through the whole summer, and\r\neven the next winter, provided the pond is deep enough to prevent their\r\nsuffocation during a hard winter; then the breeders and the fry are put\r\ninto ponds safer for their wintering.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of ponds are the nurseries; the young fish should be\r\nmoved, in a fine calm day, into this pond, in the months of March or\r\nApril: a thousand or twelve hundred of this fry may be well accommodated\r\nin a pond of an acre. When they are first put in, they should be well\r\nwatched, and driven from the sides of the pond, lest they become the prey\r\nof rapacious birds. In two summers, they will grow as much as to weigh\r\nfour, five, or even six pounds, and be fleshy and well tasted.\r\n\r\nThe main ponds are to put those into that measure a foot, head and tail\r\ninclusive; every square of fifteen feet is sufficient for one Carp: their\r\ngrowth depends on their room, and the quantity of food allowed them.\r\n\r\nThe best seasons for stocking the main ponds are spring and autumn. Carp\r\ngrow for many years, and become of considerable size and weight. Mr.\r\nFoster mentions seeing in Prussia two or three hundred Carps of two and\r\nthree feet in length, and one five feet long, and twenty-five pounds\r\nweight; it was supposed to be about sixty years old: Gesner mentions\r\none that was an hundred years old. These were tame, and would come to\r\nthe side of the pond to be fed, and swallowed with ease a piece of\r\nbread half the size of a halfpenny loaf. Ponds should be well supplied\r\nwith water during the winter; and when they are covered with ice, holes\r\nshould be opened every day for the admission of fresh air, through want\r\nof which, Carps frequently perish. Carp are sometimes fed, during the\r\ncolder season, in a cellar: the fish is wrapped up in a quantity of wet\r\nmoss laid on a piece of a net, and then laid in to a purse; but in such a\r\nmanner, however, to admit of the fish breathing: the net is then plunged\r\ninto water, and hung up to the ceiling of the cellar: the dipping must\r\nat first be repeated every three or four hours, but, afterwards, it need\r\nbe plunged into the water only once in six or seven hours: bread soaked\r\nin milk is sometimes given him in small quantities; in a short time, the\r\nfish will bear more, and grow fat by this treatment. Many have been kept\r\nalive, breathing nothing but air in this way, several successive days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cephalus. The Chub._ _Fortin. Albin delin. 1740._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The CHUB_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs, according to the Artedian and Linnæan system, a species of Cyprinus,\r\nand is called by the French the Vilian and Testard, and was called by\r\nthe ancient Romans Squalus. The resorts of this fish are easily found;\r\nbeing generally holes over-shaded by trees; and on a hot day, they may\r\nbe seen in great numbers, floating almost on the surface of the water.\r\nFor the table they are very poor fish, full of bones. They afford much\r\nentertainment to the angler, and are easily caught. The best manner of\r\nfishing for them is thus: prepare a very strong rod of sufficient length;\r\nfix a grashopper to the hook; place yourself so as not to be perceived\r\nby the fish, and drop in the bait about two feet from the place where a\r\nChub lies; if he does not see the angler, he rarely fails biting, and is\r\ntaken directly; but he is so strong a fish, that he should be taken out\r\ncarefully, after a great deal of play, otherwise the tackle will be in\r\ndanger; a beetle, or any large fly, will answer the purpose in the place\r\nof a grashopper; and if none of them are to be had, the method of fishing\r\nmust be altered, and the line be long enough for fishing at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn March and April, this fish is to be caught with red worms; in June and\r\nJuly, with worms, snails, and cherries; but in August and September, the\r\nproper bait is good cheese, pounded in a mortar with some saffron and a\r\nlittle butter. Some make paste of cheese and Venice turpentine for the\r\nChub in winter, at which season the fish is better than at any other; the\r\nbones are less troublesome in this season, and the flesh more firm and\r\nbetter tasted. The roe is also generally well flavoured. The angler must\r\nkeep his bait for this fish at the bottom in cold weather, and near the\r\ntop in hot. The fish will bite easily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Asellus Major. The Cod-fish._ _E. Albin Delin: March 29.\r\n1739._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The COD FISH_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the largest of the genus Aselli, by authors called Asellus Maximus,\r\nand sometimes Asellus Varius, five Striatus. It is distinguished from\r\nother fishes of the same kind by the following marks. Its colour on the\r\nback and sides is a dusky olive, intermixed with yellow spots; a white\r\nbelly, with a white line running along each side from the gills to the\r\ntail, which is curved at the abdomen, but straight elsewhere. It has very\r\nsmall scales, which adhere firmly to the skin; its eyes are large; a\r\nsingle beard hangs at the angle of its lower jaw, which is short, seldom\r\nlonger than one’s finger. It has a broad tongue, and several rows of\r\nteeth, one being much longer than the rest. Among these there are some\r\nmoveable teeth, as in the Pike; and in the palate, near the orifice of\r\nthe stomach, and near the gills, it has small clusters of teeth; it has\r\nthree back-fins, two at the gills, two at the breast, and two at the\r\nanus; and the tail is plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Asellus Minor. The Haddock._ _Fortin. Albin delin.\r\n1740._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The HADDOCK_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs, according to the Artedian system, of the genus of Gadi. It is called\r\nby Salvian the Asellus Major, or Greater Asellus, and by Turner and\r\nWilloughby the Orus, or Asinus of the Ancients. Charlton tells us, that\r\nit was the Callaris Galeris, or Galaxis, of the old Romans, mentioned\r\nby Pliny; but Artedi has some doubt about that. It is likewise called\r\nby Artedi the Gadus; with a bearded mouth, three fins on the back, a\r\nwhitish body, with the upper jaw longest; the tail a little forked. Large\r\nHaddocks begin to be in roe about the middle of November, and continue so\r\ntill the end of January; from that time till May, their tails grow thin,\r\nand they are out of season.\r\n\r\nThe small ones are very good from May to February; and those which are\r\nnot old enough to breed in February, March, and April. It is said by\r\nfishermen, that in rough weather they hide themselves in the sand at the\r\nbottom of the sea, and among the ooze, and shelter themselves till the\r\nstorm is over, because they take none in stormy weather. They live in the\r\nsummer on young Herrings, and on other young fish; and in winter, on a\r\nspecies of sespula, called the stone-coated Worm, and by the fishermen,\r\nHaddock-meat. The great shoals of Haddocks come periodically on the\r\ncoast of Yorkshire. The large ones quit the coast as soon as they get out\r\nof season, and leave behind them a number of small ones. They are said to\r\nvisit the coasts of Hamburgh and Jutland in the summer. There is a large\r\nblack spot on each side of the Haddock, ascribed by superstition to the\r\nmark which St. Peter’s thumb made, when he took the tribute money out of\r\nthe mouth of a species of this fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Halec. The Herring._ _E. Albin Del: 1739._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The HERRING._\r\n\r\n\r\nHarengus, in Icthyology, a species of the Clopea. Its Harengi forms are\r\nthese: its length is generally seven or eight inches, though it sometimes\r\ngrows to a foot; its head is flatted, and its mouth placed upwards: it\r\nhas a green back and sides mingled with blue, and a belly of a silver\r\ncast; its scales are large and round. It is not spotted at all, and its\r\nbelly is carinated; the ridge is quite smooth, and not at all serrated;\r\nits side lines are small, and scarce distinguishable; the lower jaw is\r\nstronger and more prominent than the upper; its gills are four in number,\r\nas in other fishes; their fibres very long, and open remarkably wide; so\r\nthat this fish dies almost as soon as taken out of the water: it has one\r\nfin on its back, which consists of about seventeen rays, and is between\r\nthe head and the tail; the two ventral fins have nine rays, the pectoral\r\nseventeen, and the anal fourteen; the tail is forked. The name Herring,\r\ntakes its derivation from the German _Heer_, an army, which expresses\r\ntheir number when they migrate our seas. Herrings are found in vast\r\nquantities from the highest northern latitudes as low as the northern\r\ncoast in France; on the coast of America large shoals of them are to be\r\nmet with as low as Carolina. In Kamtschatka they are also to be found,\r\nand very possibly in Japan: their winter rendezvous is within the arctic\r\ncircle; they retire there after spawning, and wherever they can meet with\r\ninsect food. They are in full roe at the end of June, and in perfection\r\ntill the commencement of winter, when they begin to deposit their spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVED HERRINGS.\r\n\r\nVarious are the names given to them, and according as they are ordered:\r\nas,\r\n\r\n1st. SEA-STICKS are what are caught all the fishing season, and but\r\nonce packed. A barrel of these contains six or eight hundred; according\r\nto law, eight barrels go to the hundred. A hundred of Herrings is one\r\nhundred and twenty; a last is ten thousand; and they generally reckon\r\nfourteen barrels to the last.\r\n\r\n2d. REPACKED HERRINGS are Herrings repacked on shore. Seventeen barrels\r\nof Sea-Sticks make from twelve to fourteen barrels of repacked Herrings.\r\nThey repack them in the following manner: take out the Herrings, wash\r\nthem in their own pickle, and lay them orderly in a fresh barrel: they\r\nhave no salt put to them; but after being close packed, have a sworn\r\ncopper put over them with the pickle when the barrel is half full: the\r\npickle is brine; so strong that the herring may swim in it.\r\n\r\n3d. SUMMERS are what are caught by the Dutch Chasers, or Divers, from\r\nJune till the middle of July. They are sold in Sea-Sticks; they will not\r\nendure repacking: they go one with another full and shotten; but the\r\nrepacked Herrings are sorted.\r\n\r\n4th. The SICK and SHOTTEN HERRINGS by themselves; the barrel should be\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n5th. CRUSS HERRINGS are what are caught after the middle of September;\r\nthey are cured with salt upon Salt: all these are full Herrings.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise another sort, called COWED HERRINGS. These serve to\r\nmake Red Herrings from September to October; they should be carried on\r\nshore within a week after they are taken; they are roed in salt, but\r\nnever gipped; those which they make Red Herrings of, are washed in fresh\r\nwater previous to their being hung up in the Herring-Houses, generally\r\nknown by the appellation of Herring-Hangs.\r\n\r\nThen followeth the manner of salting Herrings. When the fishes are taken\r\nout of the nets and put into the warbacks which stand on the side of\r\nthe vessel, one fills the gipper’s baskets. The gippers, after having\r\ncut their throats and taken out their guts, proceed to sort them. When\r\nthe gipped are put into the basket, one man takes it to the rowerback,\r\nwherein there is salt; one stirs them about in the salt, whilst another\r\ntakes them from him, and carries them in baskets to the packers. Each\r\nbarrel is packed by four men, who lay the Herrings one by one in a very\r\neven manner; which barrel being full, another man takes it from them.\r\nThe barrel is usually left to stand open for a day or two, to dissolve\r\nthe salt; afterwards it is filled up, and the barrel is headed. Observe,\r\nthat the pickle be strong enough to sustain the fish; otherwise they will\r\ndecay in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scombrus. Maquereau. a Mackarel._ _Eleaz. Albin del: May\r\n3. 1739._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scombrus. Maquereau. a Mackarel._ _Eleazar Albin\r\ndelinavit. July 21. 1735._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The MACKAREL._\r\n\r\n\r\nA very common sea fish of the Schomber kind. Its nose is sharp pointed\r\nand tapered; its eyes large; and both its jaws of the same length: the\r\nteeth are small, but very numerous; the body compressed on the sides;\r\ntowards the tail, it is rather slender, and somewhat angular. The first\r\ndorsal fin is placed a little behind the pectoral fin; it is triangular,\r\nand has nine or ten stiff rays; the second has twelve soft rays, and lies\r\nat a distance from the other; the pectoral has twenty, and the ventral\r\nsix rays: at the base of the anal fin, is a long spine. Betwixt the last\r\ndorsal and the tail, are five small fins; the same number, likewise,\r\nbetwixt the anal and the tail. The tail is broad and semilunar; the\r\ncolour of the back and sides above the lateral line is beautiful green,\r\nvariegated with black lines pointing downwards; beneath the line, the\r\nbelly is of a beautiful silvery colour. The eyes of the Mackarel are\r\nalmost covered with a white film, which grows in winter, during which\r\ntime they are nearly blind: they cast it in the beginning of summer.\r\n\r\nIt is in high estimation amongst the Romans, because it furnished the\r\nprecious garum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mullus. the Mullet._ _Eleaz. Albin Delin. 1739._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The MULLET_,\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a name given indeterminately to fish of several kinds; but the true\r\nmeaning of the word is the same with that of the Mugil, or Cephalus. The\r\ncharacters of the Mugil are these. The branchiostege membrane on each\r\nside contains six crooked bones; the upper one being the broadest, and\r\nhid under the gills; only five are discernible; the scales are large, and\r\ncover the head and the opercula of the gills, as well as the body of the\r\nfish. The head is depressed in the anterior part; the body oblong and\r\ncompressed. According to these distinctions, there is only one species\r\nof Mugil, namely, the Mugil of Ovid and the Ancients. It resembles the\r\nThymallus in its external figure; its jaws are tender and thin, and have\r\nno teeth in them; the tail is forked. The Linnæan system reckons two\r\nspecies; viz. the Cephalus and Albula.\r\n\r\nThree or four different species of the Mugil have been described by\r\nRondeletius and others; but their difference seems to arise merely from\r\nage, place, and the like accidents.\r\n\r\nThe nose is sharp, the belly bowed; the head plain and flatted; the\r\nscales are very large, and cover the body entirely. The back is of a\r\ndusky blue, or greenish-brown colour; the belly white, and the sides\r\nvariegated, from the head to the tail, with green and black lines; its\r\ntongue is rather rough; it has no teeth. It preys upon no fish, and is\r\ntherefore supposed to feed on weeds. At certain times it comes up the\r\nriver, but it is generally caught at sea.\r\n\r\nThe Mullet is a very good tasted fish; we make tobago of its spawn.\r\n\r\nMullets are to be found chiefly on the sandy coasts; particularly where\r\nthere are influxes of fresh water. They come in great shoals; and they\r\nkeep rooting the mud like hogs, and leave their trace in the form of\r\nlarge round holes.\r\n\r\nThey are very cunning; and when surrounded with a net, the whole shoal\r\nfrequently escape by leaping over it; for if one takes the lead, the\r\nothers are sure to follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Perca. Perche. A Pearch._ _Eleazar Albin Del. July 8.\r\n1736._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Pearch from the River Rhine._ _Eleaz. Albin del: May\r\n1. 1739._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The PEARCH, or PERCH_,\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a genus of fish of the order of Thoracci; the characters of these are,\r\nthat the membrane of the gills has seven bones, and the back has one\r\nor two fins; the first spiny, and the second soft: the body is covered\r\nwith rough scales; the edges of the gill-covers are scaly and serrated.\r\nLinnæus enumerates thirty-six species; this fish is variegated with black\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThere is a strange variety of Pearch; some of which are quite hunched;\r\nand the backbone, near to the tail, very much distorted: in colour and\r\nother respects, it is similar to the common kind.\r\n\r\nThe best time for their biting is betwixt spring and summer, as at that\r\ntime they are very greedy; and the angler, with good management, may take\r\nall that are in the hole, at one standing, if there were ever so many.\r\nThe Pearch will bite all day long, if it be cloudy; but the best time\r\nis from eight till ten in the morning, and from three till six in the\r\nafternoon. It is very abstemious in the winter, and will seldom bite; if\r\nit does at all, it is in the middle of the day. All fish bite best at\r\nthis time of the day in that season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lucius. The Pike or Jack._ _Eliza. Albin delin. 1740._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The PIKE_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the Lucius Esox of Linnæus. It has a very flat head; the upper jaw is\r\nbroad, and shorter than the lower, which turns up a little at the end;\r\nthe body is long, slender, and compressed sideways; the teeth are very\r\nsharp, disposed only in the front of the upper jaw, but in both sides\r\nof the lower; sometimes in the roof of the mouth, and frequently in the\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are small, and the slit of the mouth very wide; the dorsal fin\r\nis placed very low on the back, and consists of twenty-one rays; the\r\npectoral of fifteen, the ventral of eleven, and the anal, of eighteen;\r\nthe tail is bifurcated.\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in most of the lakes in Europe. Lapland produces\r\nvery large ones, some eight feet long; they are dried there, and exported\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nThe Pike was introduced into England in the reign of Henry VIII. in 1537,\r\nwhen a Pike was sold for double the price of a house lamb in February.\r\nBesides its usual food, fish and frogs, it devours water-rats and young\r\nducks. It is remarkable for its longevity: we read of one that lived till\r\nninety years old, and of another that was no less than two hundred and\r\nseventy years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rubellio. The Roach._ _E. Albin Del: 1739._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The ROACH_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the English name of a very common fish, called by some authors the\r\nRutilius and Rubiculus, and by others the Rubellio. It is a species of\r\nthe Cyprinus, according to the new system of Artedi, and the Cyprinus\r\nRutilius of Linnæus. It has been looked upon (though without much reason)\r\nremarkable for its liveliness and vivacity, from which comes the proverb\r\n“sound as a Roach.” In some parts of the world, this fish will only live\r\nin standing waters: it thrives very much in ponds and deep, still rivers:\r\nit is very remarkable for its progeny; a pond being sooner stocked with\r\nthis fish than any other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Clupea: Halachie. A Shad._ _Eleazar Albin Del. June 30.\r\n1736._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The SHAD_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs the name of a sea fish of the Herring kind; it is also called the\r\nMother of Herrings; by some authors Clupea and Trissa; by the Ancients\r\nTrechis, or Trichias; and the Clupea Alosa of Linnæus. In its general\r\nform, it very much resembles the Herring; only it is flatter and\r\nbroader, and grows to a cubit long and four inches broad. The back is\r\nconvex and rather sharp; the head sloping considerably from it. The body\r\ngrows gradually less to the tail from thence. The lower jaw is rather\r\nlonger than the upper; the teeth very minute. The dorsal fin is small,\r\nand placed very near the center: the middle rays are the longest. The\r\npectoral and ventral fins are small; the belly very sharp; the tail\r\nforked: the body is of a dusky blue. Above the gills is a line of black\r\nspots, which mark the upper part of the back on each side. The number of\r\nthese spots is different in different fish, from four to ten.\r\n\r\nIt is very common in many of our seas, and in some of our rivers which\r\nlie near the sea. They run up there in great numbers, and are then very\r\nfat; they afterwards become lean, and go down to the sea again. They\r\nusually swim in large shoals together.\r\n\r\nThe Shad is in higher perfection in the Severn than in any other river\r\nin Great Britain. It appears there in May, and in very warm seasons, in\r\nApril; it continues about two months. At its first appearance, it is\r\nesteemed a very delicate fish; especially at Gloucester, where it sells\r\ndearer than Salmon. The London fishmongers distinguish it from that of\r\nthe Thames by the French name of Alose. Whether they spawn in the Severn\r\nand Wye, is not determined, as their fry has not yet been ascertained.\r\nThe old fish come from the sea in full roe.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen imagine, very erroneously, that the Bleak, which appear in\r\nmultitudes near Gloucester in the months of July and August, are the fry\r\nof the Shad: many of these are taken in those months only; but none of\r\nthe emaciated Shad are ever caught in their return.\r\n\r\nThe Thames Shad does not frequent the river till the month of July, and\r\nis thought a very coarse, insipid fish. At that time, the Twaite, a\r\nvariety of Shad which makes its appearance in Gloucester, and is taken\r\nin great numbers in the Severn, but held in as great disrepute as the\r\nShad of the Thames. The real Shad weighs sometimes eight pounds; but in\r\ngeneral from four to five. The Twaite, on the contrary, weighs from half\r\na pound to two pounds, which it never exceeds. It only differs from the\r\nsmall Shad, by having one or more black spots on its side, which are\r\ngenerally placed one under the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tinca: Tenche: A Tench._ _Eliza. Albin Delin. May 27.\r\n1737._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The TENCH_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs, in Icthyology, the English name of the Tinca of the modern authors;\r\nbut, according to the Artedian and Linnæan system, a species of the\r\nCyprinus. It is distinguished by Artedi by the name of the blackish,\r\nmucous, or slimy Cyprinus, with the end of the tail even.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Salmon Trout from Berwick on Tweed_ _E. Albin 1740._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trocta, the Trout._ _Albin Fecit, 1741._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The TROUT_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs a very valuable river-fish; the characters of which are these. It has\r\na long body; its head is short and round, its nose blunt at the end: its\r\ntail is very broad; its mouth large, and each jaw furnished with one row\r\nof sharp teeth. In its palate there are three parcels of teeth, each of\r\nan oblong figure, in the congeries, and all meeting in an angle near the\r\nend of the nose; the tongue has also six, eight, or ten teeth on it. It\r\nis very beautifully variegated on the sides with red spots. The colour\r\nof the Trout, and of its spots, varies greatly in different waters and\r\ndifferent seasons; yet you may reduce each to one species.\r\n\r\nIn Llyndivi (a lake in South Wales), there are Trouts called Coch y Dail,\r\nmarked with red and black spots about the size of a sixpence; others,\r\nnot spotted, and of a reddish hue, which sometimes weigh from eight to\r\nten pounds: they are very ill tasted. In Lough Neagh, in Ireland, there\r\nare Trouts called Buddagh, many of which weigh thirty pounds; others are\r\ntaken of a much superior size, in Hulse Water (a lake in Cumberland), the\r\nsame as those Trouts in the lakes of Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe stomachs of the common Trouts are very thick and muscular, as they\r\nfeed on the shell fish of lakes and rivers as well as the small fish; and\r\ntake gravel or stones into their stomachs to assist in comminuting the\r\ntestaceous parts of their food. The Trouts of certain lakes in Ireland\r\nare remarkable for the great thickness of their stomachs, which, from\r\nsome resemblance to the digesting organs in birds, are called Gizzards;\r\nand the species which have them, are called Gizzard Trouts. These\r\nstomachs are frequently served up to the table in Ireland, under the\r\nnomination of Gizzards.\r\n\r\nTrouts are a very voracious fish, affording the angler great amusement.\r\nThe under jaw of the Trout is subject to the same curvature as that of\r\nthe Salmon. There is likewise a species of Trout, which migrates out of\r\nthe sea into the river Esk in Cumberland, from July to September, and\r\ncalled, from its colour, the Whiting. Its taste is delicious. When they\r\nfirst make their appearance from the salt water, they have a Salmon Louse\r\nadhering to them. They have milt and spawn; but no fry has been yet\r\nobserved. It goes under the appellation of Phinocs, among the Scotch.\r\nThey are never more than a foot in length; the upper jaw is somewhat\r\nlonger than the lower; the upper contains two rows of teeth, and the\r\nlower one: on the tongue there are six teeth. Its form is truly elegant;\r\nthe colour dusky, mingled with silver. First dorsal fin spotted with\r\nblack; the tail quite black, and forked; the first dorsal fin has eleven\r\nrays; the pectoral thirteen; the ventral nine; the anal nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Asellus. The Whiting._ _Fortin. Albin. delin. 1740_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The WHITING_\r\n\r\n\r\nIs, in Icthyology, the English name of a common fish of the Asellus kind,\r\ncalled by some Asellus Mollis, and by others Asellus Albus, or Merlangus.\r\nIt is certainly, according to the Artedian system, one of the Gadi;\r\ndistinguished by that author by the name of Gadus with three fins on the\r\nback; without beards, with a white body; the upper jaw longer than the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nThe Whiting, or Gadus Melangus of Linnæus, has a very elegant form: its\r\neyes are large, its nose sharp; the teeth of the upper jaw are very long,\r\nand appear above the lower when closed. The first dorsal fin has fifteen\r\nrays, the second eighteen, and the last twenty. The head and back are of\r\na pale brown colour; the lateral line white and crooked; the belly and\r\nsides silvery; the sides being marked lengthways with yellow.\r\n\r\nThey appear in the sea, by large shoals, in the spring, keeping at the\r\ndistance of about half a mile to that of three miles from the shore. They\r\nare the most delicate and wholesome of any of the genus, and seldom grow\r\nto more than ten or twelve inches in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    A\r\n                                DISCOURSE\r\n                                   OF\r\n                          FISH AND FISH-PONDS,\r\n\r\n                                   BY\r\n                          The Hon. ROGER NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOURSE OF FISH AND FISH-PONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Situation and Disposition of the principal Waters._\r\n\r\nOne great point in the conduct of fish, is, to have them at command;\r\nanother is, to have perpetual recruits, to supply your stock as you draw\r\nit off. This is not to be done without a certain order and method; and\r\nwith it, nothing is more practicable and easy.\r\n\r\nYour method must be, to have some great waters, which are the\r\nhead-quarters of the fish, from whence you may take, or wherein you may\r\nput, any ordinary quantity of fish. Then to have stews, and other proper\r\nauxiliary waters, so as you lead the fish from one to the other, whereby\r\nyou never shall want, and need not abound; and, which is more, lose no\r\ntime in the growth of the fish, but employ the water, as you do your\r\nland, to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nThis will appear more distinctly in the sequel of this discourse, which\r\nshall begin with the situation and disposition of the principal waters,\r\nwhereupon you must depend for the raising and feeding the greatest part\r\nof the stock.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must examine the grounds, and find some fall betwixt two\r\nhills, as near a flat as may be, so as there be a sufficient current\r\nfor the water. If there be any difficulty in judging of such, take an\r\nopportunity after some sudden rain, or the breaking up of a great snow\r\nin winter, and you shall see plainly which way the ground casts; for the\r\nwater will take the true fall, and run accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the place must determine the quantity of ground to be\r\ncovered with water. I should propose in all, fifteen acres in three\r\nponds, or eight acres in two, and not less. And these ponds should be\r\nplaced one above another, so as the point of the lower may almost reach\r\nthe head or bank of the upper; which will be very beautiful, as well as\r\nprofitable, as will appear afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe head or bank, which, by stopping the water in its current, is to\r\nraise the water, and so make a pond, must be built with the clay and\r\nearth taken from the pan or hollow dug in the lowest ground above the\r\nbank; and that pan should be shaped as half an oval, whereof the flat\r\ncomes to the bank, and the longer diameter runs square from it.\r\n\r\nBut were there not need of earth for this purpose, it were better to\r\nleave the natural soil for the fish to feed upon. I shall give the reason\r\nafterwards, and consider the manner of raising and fortifying the bank\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Manner of the making and raising Pond-Heads._\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that if you make a dam cross a valley or swamp, where at\r\nany time after, the water runs, it will produce a pond; and as the bank\r\nor dam is higher at the point or center, which is against the lowest\r\nground, so much is the pond deeper; and if the hills on each side rise\r\nsteep and quick, the water stopped will cover less ground than if they\r\nrise slow.\r\n\r\nNow first, for making the bank or head, you must be sure it is tight, and\r\nthat it do not sew or leak, as it will certainly do, if it be composed\r\nof mere earth; therefore a bed or wall of clay, the whole length of the\r\nbank, must be carried up with good ramming, from a foot or two below the\r\nsurface of the ground, to such height as you propose the water shall\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nIf you do not give the bed of clay this foundation, the water lying under\r\na great weight from the depth of it, will work itself underneath, so\r\nallow a spit or two at least for it. Then, as you ram the clay, you must\r\nbe sure that earth be brought to carry the bank up with it, or else the\r\nsun will search and crack it, which is of pernicious consequence; so when\r\nit is come to its full height, close and cover it with earth immediately,\r\nlest the inconvenience happens.\r\n\r\nYou must allow three feet to the breadth of this bed of clay, and raise\r\nit to the height you intend the water shall stand, and lay earth three\r\nfeet higher; two feet would have served, but that the allowance of one\r\nat least must be made for the sinking of the bank; for it will do so\r\nnotwithstanding the pressing of tumbrels, horses, and men working upon it.\r\n\r\nIf you project many stews, or other ponds to be sunk right down about\r\nthe same time, you will have great advantage by the clay you take out of\r\nthem, which will be much more than is necessary for the bed, and that may\r\nfortify the bed, by being pressed down by the tumbrels on each side of\r\nit; and so the bank will be very much confirmed, and it will also save\r\nbreaking of ground within the pond, which is a great advantage in the\r\nfeed of the fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dimensions of Pond-Heads._\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of these banks are governed by the manner of the hills\r\nrising; for if it be quick, then, to cover a competent quantity of\r\nground, you must raise the bank higher, and consequently it must be made\r\nstronger, than when the ground riseth slow, so as a moderate height\r\nshall cast the water upon ground enough. And of this there will be\r\ngreat difference; for in some places, ten feet high shall cover as much\r\nas twenty feet in others. And this will be easily discovered by the\r\nwater-level, used according to art, whereby you may stake the water-line\r\nupon the ground to any height; and so you will fix the determinate height\r\nof the bank.\r\n\r\nI will suppose a medium, and that a bank, fourteen feet high at the\r\ncenter, will cover the quantity of ground. Then you must make your bank\r\nat the foot at least fifty feet wide, and so straitening by equal degrees\r\non either side, bring it to sixteen at the top; and so you will have a\r\nsufficient slope, and the bank will stand firm and durable, scarce to be\r\ndestroyed without as much pains and industry as made it.\r\n\r\nBy this proportion, pond heads of any dimension may be projected; the\r\nmatter is not so nicely circumstanced, that a little more or less\r\nshould signify. But it must be noted, that to make them too slight, is\r\nthe greatest error, and most to be avoided; let them be rather made\r\ntoo strong, for then you have not only a more secure bank, but a more\r\nbeautiful walk, and more room for wheel-carriage, besides a capacity of\r\nsome wood; all which compensate the charge of what is superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of securing your Banks._\r\n\r\nIf the bank be well made, and in sufficient dimension, nothing can hurt\r\nit, but great land-floods, or water-shots, which, if suffered to run over\r\nthe bank, will carry away the fish, which in a warm flood will rise, and\r\ngo with it to seek adventures, but also gurry holes in the back of the\r\nbank, and weaken it so much, that if the flood continues, it shall carry\r\nall away together.\r\n\r\nFor preventing of this mischief, there are two ways; 1. Grates at each\r\nend of the bank, planted upon the level that is to be the highest of the\r\nwater. 2. Channels of diversion, which being taken so high in the current\r\nas may lead the water upon the side of either hill above the bank, you\r\nhave the power to turn out all the water when you please, so that none\r\nshall come upon the bank.\r\n\r\n1. As to grates, the way of them is well known; however observe, that if\r\nthey be made of wood, the banks must be set diagonally, like window-bars;\r\nfor so rubbish stops least against them, and the water passeth freely.\r\nAnd in regard you cannot allow any great distance between them for\r\nkeeping in the fish, you must help out the room by extending the grate\r\nfrom each side of the cut in the bank where the water is to vent, some\r\nconsiderable space from the bank, and there to meet in a point, forming\r\na triangle upon the bank. Here are many more slits for the water to vent\r\nat, than if the grate lay flat upon the bank, covering the passage only.\r\nAnd if need be, there may be doors to slide up and down, made in the\r\ngrate, to let the water pass more freely; but this endangereth losing the\r\nfish. If you will afford iron for these grates, you need only cover the\r\npassage of the bank; for the bars need not be so thick, but there will be\r\nspace enough for the water to vent at.\r\n\r\n2. The channels for diverting the water are very useful in this and many\r\nother respects; for they give you a perfect command of the water, and\r\nyou may turn it which way you please, so as to fill or keep dry any of\r\nthe ponds, and in a wet season are a perfect security. These should be\r\nmade four feet wide, and on each side of the ponds the loss of ground is\r\nnot considerable; for wood growing there will make amends for it.\r\n\r\nThe string of ponds in Hyde-Park are admirably disposed in this respect;\r\nfor the current of the valley is carried along by the side of all the\r\nponds, and may be let into any of them, or any may be emptied into it;\r\nthan which, there is not a greater command of water.\r\n\r\nHowever carefully a bank is made, it is probable it will sew a little at\r\nfirst; but this should be no discouragement; for by the settling of the\r\nearth, it will continually grow higher, and in a few years, if made with\r\ntolerable care, be as firm as a rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Sluices._\r\n\r\nThese are very requisite to the good command of a water, and though\r\nvery ordinarily used, yet require an experienced carpenter to make and\r\nfix them as should be, especially in great waters; and such as have not\r\nexperience, shall err most grossly in this work. They must be framed so\r\nas to stand firm, that the force of any thrust, or a boat’s running\r\nagainst them, may do no prejudice to them: for if they are any thing\r\nstrained, they are apt to prove leaky; and in so great an height as is\r\nneedful for deep waters, a small matter will do it, unless they are\r\nextraordinarily well abutted.\r\n\r\nThe timber-work must be heart of oak, especially the top, and that all of\r\none piece, how long soever it be; and the vent hole must be guarded with\r\nlarge boxes perforated so as the water, but no fish, may pass. And all\r\nthis well framed, and what is under ground extraordinarily rammed with\r\nclay, else it will be apt to leak.\r\n\r\nThe use of these is very great: for if a great water must be emptied,\r\nyou must either apply engines, cut the bank, or draw a sluice. As for\r\nengines, they are too chargeable, and puzzling to fix; however, I may\r\npropose to them that are lovers of art, some facile ways of lifting\r\ngreat quantities of water. Then, if you cut the bank, the passage is\r\ninterrupted and made troublesome by the earth, and you shall scarce ram\r\nit up so well again, but it will perpetually leak about the place where\r\nthe fissure was; but sluices vent the water certainly, though slowly,\r\nwithout any labour, charge, or inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Manner of working to raise a Pond-Head._\r\n\r\nNow, as for the manner of raising this bank, which I think is the only\r\nchargeable work you have, I shall give some light into the way of\r\nworking, so as to abridge the expence as much as may be. The advantage of\r\ntrades, is, that by continual experience, they find nearer ways of doing\r\nthings, spending fewer strokes, and less time, than others can. And in\r\nthe conduct of this work, there is much to be saved; every man’s reason\r\nleads him to contrive compendiums of business, as I have done in the\r\ndisposition of my waters; which experience of mine may save others the\r\nthought, as well as loss by making their own experiments.\r\n\r\nWhen you have projected your work, for which the latter end of June,\r\nor the beginning of May, is the best time, take the assistance of your\r\nneighbours, and provide yourself with six tumbrels, four good horses, and\r\ntwo stout labourers, besides the driver to each pair of tumbrels. I call\r\nthem pairs, because they work alternately with the same horses; so that\r\none is filling, while the other is moving, and your labourers, as well as\r\nhorses, are always at work.\r\n\r\nThe first work to be done, is, the taking up the first spit of earth\r\nwhere the bank is to be, and from the pan of the pond, and to lay it by\r\nfor the uses I shall declare hereafter.\r\n\r\nThen lay down your sluice, with trunks sufficient to convey the water\r\nthrough the head or bank. This must be done at the deepest part of the\r\nground, which probably will fall in the center of the bank. This will\r\nemploy two pair of tumbrels and four labourers, for digging and fetching\r\nof clay, besides four labourers to ram it, which must be, as was said,\r\nvery well done. And the carpenter, who beforehand hath fitted his work,\r\nmust attend also one whole day to help in the laying it down, and to see\r\nit well rammed.\r\n\r\nThe next day’s work may be the employment of two pair of tumbrels in\r\nfetching of clay, and four or five good labourers to ram the foundation\r\nof the bed of clay. And I suppose this may rise a foot in one whole day’s\r\nwork, more or less, as the length of the head is. Clay riseth stiff, and\r\nfor that, if it riseth near, as in the pan of the pond, three labourers\r\nto a pair of tumbrels, are requisite to dig and fill, otherwise the\r\nhorses will be idle, and want work as well as the rammers.\r\n\r\nThe day after employ four pair of tumbrels more, to fetch earth out of\r\nthe pan of the pond to lay along the bank on each side of the bed of\r\nclay, the whole length of the head; and to this work, two labourers for a\r\npair of tumbrels are enough.\r\n\r\nHere you must lay on six labourers at least, to ram the bed of clay, and\r\nspread earth upon the bank, so that it may be done as fast as the six\r\ntumbrels supply it; and by this means the bank and bed of clay will rise\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThus you proceed till the bank is finished, which will rise faster as\r\nyou come nearer the top, and so will somewhat alter the employment of\r\nthe tumbrels and men, which you must conform in proportion accordingly.\r\nAnd observing these directions, you may make two ponds in one month\r\n(supposing the weather propitious), which shall be three, four, or five\r\nacres apiece, as the ground gives, and not expend in money above eighty\r\npounds, although you pay for every hour’s work of man and horse.\r\n\r\nBut considering that a gentleman is supposed to intend this business, not\r\nonly as a care, but an entertainment, he will not suffer his own servants\r\nand horses to be without a share of it; and then I cannot imagine which\r\nway he can expend above sixty pounds, supposing labourers work for twelve\r\npence per day, which I cannot say they will do in all countries.\r\n\r\nThe third pond may be a work of another year; and if the ground lies\r\nfair for it, that is, much upon a level, I would not be without it; for\r\nit will add much to the ornament of your estate, because it will fill up\r\na range or string of waters, which two do not; and besides contribute\r\nvastly to the increase of fish, as I shall shew; and I press this thing\r\nthe rather, because without it, in the method I propose, you will have\r\nthe use of but one pond as to water every year. Nay, were not œconomy,\r\nand saving charge, one great branch of my design, I should recommend more\r\nof these waters, if the place will receive them.\r\n\r\nAnd to demonstrate the charge is not so very great, compared with the\r\nother expences gentlemen are at for their diversion, without any return\r\nof profit, as to deter any from undertaking this particular work; I\r\nmust remember, that once, at the command of my Lord North, I did, as I\r\nhave directed, proceed to the making one great pond, and one stew, at\r\nCatledge, which are still to be seen, but neglected; and besides, the\r\nregard to profit by the fish they would maintain and supply, the very\r\nornament of them was worth the charge. I was limited to ten pounds,\r\nbesides the work of his lordship’s horses, which I compute to be four\r\npounds more; so the whole did not cost fifteen pounds, and yet a full\r\nacre of ground lay under water, and all was completed in twelve days. His\r\nlordship would not allow the laying down a sluice, else that water was a\r\nspecimen of my proposition, as well for the conduct, as the charge of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Auxiliary Waters._\r\n\r\nAs a great garrison must have many subservient forts and redoubts\r\ndispersed about the place, for securing the country, and collecting the\r\ncontributions, which are to maintain the head-quarters; so the great\r\nponds, which are the head-quarters of the fish, must be accommodated\r\nwith many other subservient waters, which I call auxiliary, because they\r\nserve to relieve the greater when over stocked, to supply them when under\r\nstocked, and to rear up and maintain fry and young stores, as well as to\r\nrender the fish easy to be taken; without which conveniences, you will\r\nhave but a sorry account of the fish.\r\n\r\nThere are stews, moats, and ordinary ponds dispersed about in your estate\r\nand neighbourhood; the employment of which being very considerable in the\r\nwell ordering of fish, I will consider each apart; and first, of stews.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Stews._\r\n\r\nThe peculiar use of these, is, to maintain fish for the daily use of your\r\nhouse and friends, whereby you may with little trouble, and at any time,\r\ntake out all or any fish they contain; therefore it is good to place them\r\nin some inclosed grounds near the chief mansion-house. Some recess in a\r\ngarden is very proper, because the fish are fenced from robbers, and your\r\njourney to them is short and easy, and your eye will be often upon them,\r\nwhich will conduce to their being well kept, and they will be an ornament\r\nto the walks.\r\n\r\nIf you have two great waters of three or four acres apiece, I do advise,\r\nthat you be not without four stews, of two rods wide and three rods long\r\napiece. The way of making these, is, by cutting the sides down somewhat\r\nsloping, and carrying the bottom in a perpetual decline from end to end,\r\nso as you may have a convenient mouth, such as horse-ponds usually have,\r\nfor taking out your nets when you draw for fish.\r\n\r\nIf you have ground enough, it is better to make a mouth at both ends, and\r\nthe deepest part in the middle; for so you may draw your nets backwards\r\nand forwards, losing less time, and the fish will not have such shelter,\r\nas the depth under a head will be. Besides this, you will find the fish\r\nwill delight themselves in coming upon the shoals, and it may be, thrive\r\nbetter. But for this manner you must allow at least a rod of ground in\r\nlength more than for the other.\r\n\r\nThese I intend for carps chiefly, though not absolutely; and if you find\r\nthe tench and perch increase and prosper, you may make other lesser stews\r\nto accommodate them apart, if you please; and so you will have them at\r\ncommand, without disturbing the other fish; only observe this by the way,\r\nthat perch will scarce live in stews and small waters, if the weather be\r\nhot, but will pine, grow lean and thin, if not die; therefore the stews\r\nare to be their winter-quarters; from whence you take them for the use of\r\nyour table, but in summer translate them to the greater ponds.\r\n\r\nThese stews being designed at the same time you raise the pond-heads,\r\nwill be done almost under the same charge, as is hinted elsewhere: and\r\nonce made, you have the fish at a minute’s warning ready for the kettle,\r\nor any other use; which convenience is the great end of all the charge\r\nand pains, and without it, you are not a master of fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Moats._\r\n\r\nThese were made ordinarily for securing of dwelling houses, rather than\r\nfor fish; and since wars have been less frequent, or rather, grown so\r\nmuch an art, that the ancient way of fortifying is not useful, are almost\r\ndisused. For being laid so near the dwelling, as we observe commonly\r\nthey are, for want of sun, and air to purge them, the water grows putrid\r\nand slimy, yielding no pleasant scent to the house; besides, when\r\nlaid dry, as is necessary sometimes, the stench and filth of them are\r\ninsupportable; and therefore many gentlemen have either slighted them\r\nwholly, or presented the form only, as a walk or low garden, planting the\r\nside-walls with fruit, but without water: and so is the moat at Althrop\r\nin Northamptonshire, a seat of the Earl of Sunderland’s, much of late\r\nbeautified, put in order, and from a defect, turned to a great perfection.\r\n\r\nBut I am an advocate for moats, ordered as they might be, and do esteem\r\nthem a very great accomplishment to a seat in many respects. 1. Though\r\nthey are not a fortification for resistance in time of war, yet against\r\npilferers and tumults, they are sufficient and better than any walls you\r\nshall make. 2. They shall nourish a world of fish, which, though not so\r\nwell at command as in other waters, yet for angling, and the sporting\r\npart of net-fishing, are better than the others are, because nearer, and\r\nfished with smaller nets. 3. They are an ornament and delight to a seat\r\nbeyond imagination, as will appear when I have shewed how I would have\r\nthem made; and of that next.\r\n\r\nThey should encompass not only the house, but all the out houses, yards,\r\norchards, and it may be a pightle or two, such as are neat for ordinary\r\nconvenience of horses, or a cow or two: I say, all that is called the\r\nhome-stall, should be environed by the moat. It should be no less than\r\nforty yards, or one hundred feet over, cut down with a slope on each\r\nside, as your pond-heads were, without walls; which are too great charge\r\nto keep in repair. And towards the pastures, you may make a mouth; if\r\nit runs the whole length of one side of your moat, it is the better,\r\nand fish will increase and thrive from it. Let there be but two avenues\r\nwith bridges: And to prevent the charge of crossing so great a length\r\nwith bridge-work, you may leave the earth on each side broad enough for\r\ncarriages, but not to meet by ten or twelve feet, which may be covered\r\nby a bridge, and underneath, the water to communicate; so the pass shall\r\nbe, as upon a causeway, with a draw-bridge; for so it may be made, if you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nI know all situations and soils will not admit of this; for some are\r\nlow and marshy, and so have naturally too much water; others are upon\r\nhanging ground, which for want of a level, cannot be moated in this\r\nmanner; others are sandy, and will not hold water: But the happiest of\r\nall, is, such a situation as either hath springs, or will take a current,\r\nand discharge it again by a sluice or gates, so that the moat shall be\r\nperpetually fed with a fresh water, and may at any time be laid dry;\r\ntherefore in these affairs there must be a previous judgment of the\r\nplace, else undertakings will not succeed, and that is a great disgrace.\r\n\r\nNow, such a moat as this hath all the convenience I spoke of, besides\r\nserves the house with water; which from the wind and the sun’s free\r\naccess to it in a great body, will certainly preserve it sweet and\r\nwholesome. The sinks of the house will not foul it, as it doth in lesser\r\nquantities, even to kill the fish, as well as make the water unfit for\r\nuse. The view of it is a delicacy the greatest epicures in gardening\r\ncourt, and we hear of it by the name of canal. Then the moving upon it in\r\nboats, either in calm weather, or with some wind that stirs the water,\r\nand gives a power of employing somewhat of sail, after a romantick way;\r\nand thus circling an house, taking the variety of walks and gardens here\r\nand there, visiting stables and offices, seeing the horses air upon the\r\nbanks, &c. are pleasures not given to be understood by any but statesmen,\r\nlaid aside for their honesty, who by experience are taught the variety of\r\ngreatness, and have an understanding to distinguish the true felicities\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nI know the objection of charge, which must be very great in such a\r\nwork, as this; but I consider the great profusion of money that is\r\nallowed to transitory vanities; such as habits, treats, equipages,\r\nnot to mention vices too well known; such as are tellers of money and\r\ndepauperate families, leaving nothing but diseases to shew for them. If\r\nso much, or a much less proportion being disposed to employ mankind,\r\nthe poor especially, in making holes, and filling them again, were much\r\nmore commendable. What is it then to produce advantage to yourself\r\nand family, to improve your habitation and estate, preserve health and\r\nreputation?\r\n\r\nBut even the charge might be alleviated, if not in great part saved,\r\nby good management. For such gross works as this may be put out to\r\nundertakers, and you may compute by the solid foot or yard, what the\r\ncharge will be; and the masters will see the men work, which you cannot\r\ndo if you are master, and do all by the day. Then, every one delights to\r\nhave raised walks and terraces about an house and garden; so that the\r\nearth being employed in such, and raising mounts in proper places, will\r\nproduce a real equivalent for the charge: but this is a digression which\r\nhere I conclude, and return to the affair of fish.\r\n\r\nThen considering moats, as commonly they are, it is not expected that the\r\nfish should be much at command, because it is difficult, and perhaps not\r\nconvenient to lay them dry. However, they should be kept full stocked,\r\nand will maintain a great many. This will mend your angling, and the\r\nfishing with nets will seldom be labour in vain, as certainly it will\r\nprove if under stocked. These waters will receive a great share of your\r\nfry and stores that are superfluous, and so preserve them.\r\n\r\nIf a moat come to be laid dry, as will be necessary sometimes to keep it\r\nfrom turning all to mud, after you have by a sluice or cut, drained the\r\nwater as low as you can, make dams with boards and clay, and ram them to\r\nbe water-tight; so you may toss the water out of one division to another,\r\nand take out the fish in good order; but if you dry all together, you\r\nwill not be able to secure all; besides, having one division full of\r\nwater, you can relieve the fry and eels by letting it upon them; which\r\nelse, for want of a fresh to let in upon them, will be lost. So when one\r\ndivision is fished, that is relieved by tossing the water out of the\r\nnext. And this course is not amiss, though you intend to throw out the\r\nmud; for the saving the fish while you are taking them out, quits the\r\ncharge of making the stanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of other auxiliary Waters._\r\n\r\nYou must have other waters besides stews, to assist in the disposition of\r\nthe fish; for laying a pond in that great order dry, as I propose, once\r\nin every year, there will be a great quantity of fish to be disposed;\r\nso that you must have a sufficient quantity of waters to receive when\r\nyou abound, and to recruit when you want. The stews will carry sixty,\r\nseventy, or eighty carps apiece, supposing you spend continually out of\r\nthem; so other waters will receive their proportion, by sending this way\r\nand that the stock of fish, you will preserve all, and know where to find\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\nThese bye-ponds will be dispersed about your estate, where perhaps your\r\npredecessors thought fit to make them, for the convenience of their\r\npastures, or you may make them as you can best, with respect to charge\r\nand other advantages, observing always in a ground to take that part for\r\nyour pond, to which the waters are most apt to settle. In some places,\r\nbut very few, the waters stand best upon the hills, and the valleys, when\r\nsandy, will not hold well. The nature of the ground is to be regarded.\r\n\r\nSome ponds of good depth, of about five or six rods square, should be\r\nassigned to maintain pikes, which, when great, ought to be kept by\r\nthemselves; for in a few years they will devour other fish, and greatly\r\nsurprise you in the destruction they will make. But I shall speak more of\r\nthis when I come to the stocking of waters.\r\n\r\nI do much approve of cleansing and carting out the mud of small\r\nstanding waters once in seven or eight years, and so letting them lie\r\ndry one summer, if you can spare the water; which, from moats, and\r\npasture-waters, can scarce be done, without great inconvenience. These\r\nmatters exercise the invention of a good œconomist, who will endeavour\r\nto prevent damage, as well as save time, and turn even his pleasures to\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nOne thing I advertise here, which is, not to let carps continue in a\r\nsmall standing water above two summers and one winter; for so you run a\r\nmuch less hazard from frost, than otherwise you will do; besides, the\r\nfish will grow much more upon transplanting, than by continuing in the\r\nsame water, and more in the great, than in the small waters: but of these\r\nthings more afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Course of laying the Great Waters Dry._\r\n\r\nBefore I come to the business of fish, I will finish what I had to say\r\nabout ponds, and the conduct of them; and of that only remains to speak\r\nof the course of laying them dry.\r\n\r\nAs for the smaller waters, I have touched what concerns them already; as\r\nfor the greater, or principal ponds, proceed thus:\r\n\r\nIn October, or after, draw the sluice of the first made pond, and lay\r\nit as dry as possible you can. It may be the sluice, especially if the\r\npond be many acres, will not vent the water suddenly. That is of no great\r\nimport, because, as the waters fall, you will have opportunity of fishing\r\nwith nets, and so clear the fish by degrees; which left to the last, will\r\nbe too great a burden to clear, and will not be done without damage;\r\nbesides, the hurry will disorder every thing. If the sluice will not vent\r\nall the water from the pan, a labourer or two will soon throw it out with\r\nscuppets. Here you find the use of the channels of diversion, spoke of\r\nbefore; for they will keep off all land-waters, if the time should prove\r\nrainy, and so permit the pond to empty, and continue dry, which you could\r\nnot answer for a day without them; and therefore they should be made on\r\nboth sides of the waters, on each hill one, which will defend the shot of\r\nthese hills, that otherwise would retard the work.\r\n\r\nWhen your pond is dry, and thus secured, keep it so all summer, and\r\nyou may make a profit of the soil sufficiently, either by ploughing or\r\nfeeding. And at Michaelmas next, or a little sooner, let fall the sluice,\r\nand turn in all the water you can, that the pond may fill, and at the\r\nbeing near full, it is ready to receive the stock again.\r\n\r\nAt the same time lay another dry, proceeding as before; which you may do\r\nalternately during your whole life: nay, if you have but two great ponds,\r\nthis is the best course, and will turn most to the profit and feed of the\r\nfish, as I shall shew when I speak of feeding.\r\n\r\nIf your stock be very great, you may let your ponds stand full two or\r\nthree years, but not longer, unless you delight to see starved lean\r\nfish; for such they will certainly be, unless you keep an under-stock by\r\nthree-fourths continuing in the same water four or five years. And it\r\nis a certain rule, that the oftener waters are laid dry, the better the\r\nfeed of the fish shall be, and more shall be maintained. And a little\r\nexperience will demonstrate the advantage to be great, as to the size,\r\nfatness, and sweetness of the fish.\r\n\r\nWhen your pond is dry, concern not yourself to carry out the mud for the\r\nfirst fourteen or fifteen years; and then let it be only out of the pan\r\nwhence you took the earth to raise the bank, but never break the turf of\r\nthe rest of the ground flowed: but when it comes to be a yard thick in\r\nmere mud, it is good to take it out; for though mud be good to improve\r\nground, yet, when it is taken from the pond, down to the dead earth, your\r\nground and soil are depauperated, and the water by consequence, which\r\ncheats the fish, that is, yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Breeding of Fish._\r\n\r\nHaving done with ponds, the manner of making, preserving, and using them,\r\nI intend next to discourse of fish, and how best to dispose them to\r\nmaintain the waters in full stock: but before I come to the stocking of\r\nwaters, I must speak of the course of breeding fish, whereby the stock is\r\nto be recruited and supplied.\r\n\r\nSome have thought, that great difference is to be found in the sorts of\r\ncarps, some whereof are more apt to grow up to a great size, others to\r\nspread and look thick, and others for the sweetness of the meat. I do\r\nnot deny but there may be some difference, but I cannot esteem it so\r\nconsiderable, as to be worth the looking after. Varieties in nature are\r\ninfinite, and in the several breeds of fish, as of other creatures: yet\r\nI have not observed so much of it in carps, that I could tell how to\r\ndistinguish them, where I could promise myself better success with one\r\nsort than another. This is a nicety which fishmongers, that make a trade\r\nof buying and selling, talk of, intending it only as a topic of mystery,\r\nwhich all trades affect, and to have something to say for valuing or\r\nundervaluing, as they sell or buy, to justify in their talk the prices\r\nthey propose to take or give; therefore this nicety is left to them.\r\n\r\nI do yet believe, that a sort of fish, bred in great numbers in bad\r\nwaters, over-stocked, and almost starved, may in process of time\r\ndegenerate, and both lose a good shape, and be less apt to grow up\r\nto a due greatness, than others that have been better descended of a\r\ncultivated stock: and on the other side, it is no less possible, that by\r\ncoming into good quarters, fish may improve and mend; so that a gentleman\r\nis to expect the goodness of his fish from the cleanness of his waters,\r\nand the plenty of their feed, and not from any choice of his stock or\r\nbreed; and let him get them where he may, if well ordered, he may assure\r\nhimself they shall answer his expectations.\r\n\r\nIt is a common observation, that some waters will, and others will not\r\nbreed. It is my experience, that most waters, the first year after having\r\nlain dry a summer, do breed, and that numerously, especially carps,\r\nwhich I have known increase to such an incredible fry, that I have been\r\ntroubled how to dispose them, so as to have them again after three or\r\nfour years, when they became good stock for great waters. Eels and perch\r\nare of very good use to keep down the breed of fish; for they prey much\r\nupon the spawn and fry of bred fish, and will probably destroy the\r\nsuperfluity of them.\r\n\r\nThe quality of breeding is scarce to be found out by any certain symptom;\r\nfor some very promising ponds do not prove useful that way. The best\r\nindication I know of a breeding pond, is, when there is good store of\r\nrush and grazing about it, and gravelly shoals, such as horse-ponds\r\nusually have. When a water takes thus to breeding, with a few milters and\r\nspawners, two or three of each, you may stock a country.\r\n\r\nAs for pike, perch, tench, roach, &c. they are observed to breed in\r\nalmost any waters, and very numerously; only eels never breed in perfect\r\nstanding waters, and without springs; and in such are neither found,\r\nnor increase, but by putting in; but where springs are, they are never\r\nwanting, though not put in: and which is most strange of all, no person\r\never saw in an eel the least token of propagation, either by milt or\r\nspawn in them; so that whether they breed at all, and how they are\r\nproduced, are questions equally mysterious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Manner of Stocking Waters._\r\n\r\nI have found a great analogy between the stocking waters with fish, and\r\npastures with cattle; and that the same conduct and discretion belong\r\nto both. Waters may be over-stocked, as pastures often are; so both may\r\nbe under-stocked. The latter is the less error; for if you over-stock,\r\nyou lose the whole summer’s seed; if you under-stock, you lose only the\r\nrest of your profit; what you do seed, is much the better, and turns to\r\naccount by more ready sale. So also of beasts; some of the same age and\r\nseeding will not thrive so well as others. I have found the like in my\r\nfish. And waters themselves, like pastures, have varieties of goodness;\r\nsome will raise carps from five to eighteen inches, in five years;\r\nothers will not do it in ten. This is most sensible between your great\r\nwaters made upon a fall, and the small standing waters, which have more\r\ninconveniencies, and are liable to frosts, and other casualties, more\r\nthan the others are.\r\n\r\nTherefore I propose, that the smaller waters should be used as nurseries,\r\nand either to breed, or be stocked with the bred fry of other waters,\r\nto raise them to a fitness for stores in your principal feed; that is,\r\nto six or eight inches. And of these bred fry, you may put one hundred\r\ninto four rods square of water, or near that proportion, and fail not\r\nto remove them in two years time; and so you will have good recruits of\r\nstores for your greater waters.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the many thousands of bred fish that you will have upon the\r\ndraining your great waters, which many are apt to slight, may be sent\r\nseveral ways to the waters about that and your neighbour’s grounds,\r\nand there fed up like chickens, and in time turn to great profit, as\r\nI shall shew; therefore they ought not to be slighted, but carefully\r\nto be preserved; the rather, because considering a pond (as I propose)\r\nwill, though but four acres, feed up one thousand six hundred carps in\r\ntwo, and perhaps in one year, from ten to eighteen inches, fit for your\r\ntable-presents, or sale. How is it possible you should restock your\r\nwaters the winter after, without this providential forecast, whereby you\r\nhave magazines of fish in other ponds, fit stores to supply your occasion?\r\n\r\nNow, as for your great and principal waters, it is hard to assign a\r\ncertain proportion for the stock; but perusing the methods I propose,\r\nyou will soon come to the knowledge what stock the waters will carry;\r\nfor laying a pond dry every year, you will see the fish well fed, or\r\nelse thin and lean; and accordingly you judge whether the stock was too\r\nlittle or too much for the water. Thus, by the thickness or fatness of\r\ncattle, you judge if your ground will carry more or not; and both as to\r\nspecies and number of fish, experience must be your guide in the stocking\r\nof waters.\r\n\r\nHowever, to save loss of time, which you must sustain by making your own\r\nexperience, I will give the best directions I can, for the first entry\r\nupon your business, and not leave the matter wholly in the dark.\r\n\r\nIf the pond be supplied with a white fat water upon great rains, you may\r\nput into it at first three hundred carps per acre, in case there be three\r\nor four acres, else not so many. And it will be expedient to put in forty\r\nor fifty tenches for a trial, because this sort of water is most proper\r\nfor carp; but being laid dry, sometimes may prove well for tenches also,\r\nwhich, when thriven, are a very good fish; but this proof by trial must\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nYou may add perches to any number, and not hurt the water: I propose\r\nsix hundred; for though they are great breeders, being also fishes of\r\nprey, they devour their own species as much, if not more than any other;\r\nand by destroying the fry of bred fish, they preserve the food for the\r\nmaintenance of their feeders, which the fry would intercept; so do good\r\nrather than harm. I took once out of a perch’s belly of ten inches, ten\r\nother perches. This is esteemed one of the best sorts of fresh-water\r\nfish, and therefore deservedly to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nHave a great care of putting bream in this sort of waters; for they will\r\ngrow up very slowly, though at last they will be great; but in the mean\r\ntime they breed so infinitely, and such a slimy nasty fry, as both robs\r\nand fouls the water, making it unfit for the other fish. But when a water\r\nis ten or twelve acres, and fed with some brook, winter and summer, they\r\nwill do very well; otherwise not to be made use of.\r\n\r\nAs for pike, which are inferior to no fresh-water fish, and now more\r\nesteemed than ever, being less plentiful upon draining the fens, and so\r\nharm more; they are dangerous guests in the great waters; for if grown\r\nlarge, they will devour and destroy the best fish, and depopulate the\r\nwater. But thus far you may trust them; if you can procure one hundred\r\njacks once in two years not exceeding nine inches, you may put them with\r\nthe carps into your great waters, so as your carps are not under nine or\r\nten inches; but take care that they stay not above two years, and then\r\nsend them to their peculiar ponds, and feed them as I shall hereafter\r\ndiscourse, and so they will grow to be very large and fine fish, which\r\nyou would not want.\r\n\r\nI cannot advise the stocking great standing waters with eels, for they\r\ngrow slow, and being of an indifferent size, will be lean and dry; but in\r\nmoats, which have the sinks of an house drain into it, is proper enough\r\nfor them, and they will thrive in it. It is a sort of fish, as I noted,\r\nthat belongs to a springy water.\r\n\r\nThese directions belong to the first stocking of new-made ponds, which,\r\nas to feeding, lie under a disadvantage; the reason I have touched, and\r\nis from the dead earth in the pan from whence you raised the bank,\r\nand that at first, which is about an acre, is almost unprofitable. But\r\nafterwards, when that dead ground hath contracted a little new soil from\r\nthe settling of the water, especially after land-floods, and lain dry a\r\nsummer, whereby it will begin to graze, it will become like the rest of\r\nthe pond, and put forth as good feed for fish as any other part. This may\r\nseem strange and new, but is a great truth, known to me from indubitable\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThen after one, two, or three years (for longer the pond must not stand\r\nfull), when you come to restock, and so on in all like occasions, you may\r\nput four hundred carp, or three hundred carp, and eight hundred tench (if\r\nthe water feeds them) into an acre, besides perches. It is incredible\r\nto those who have not seen it, as I have done, how carps thus ordered,\r\nby transplanting them every year or two, will grow. I affirm, that from\r\nsix, they will grow to twelve and better the first, and to fifteen or\r\nsixteen the next year; and then they are most fit for a gentleman’s table\r\nordinarily; for though greater are more ostentatious, yet these are the\r\nmost sweet and best meat, as young flesh is commonly preferred to old.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, that if the fish wherewith you stock the waters, were\r\nkept so close together, and come from over-stocked waters, which renders\r\nthem lean and poor, you must double the stock at first; else the two\r\nsudden plenty of food at first will surfeit them, and they will die of\r\novermuch blood, as I have found to my great loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Manner of feeding Fish._\r\n\r\nIn a stew you may keep up thirty or forty carps, from October to March in\r\nwinter, without feeding; and by fishing with trammels or flews in March\r\nor April, you may take from your great waters, to recruit the stews; but\r\nyou must not fail to feed all summer, from March to October again, as\r\nconstantly as your cooped chickens are fed, and to as good and certain\r\naccount. The reason you feed in summer, and not in winter, is, because\r\nthe fish will lie close in cold weather, and feed little, not caring to\r\nstir, especially upon the shoals, where it is proper to give them meat.\r\n\r\nIf you would bring more fish together into your stews, you may preserve\r\nand improve them by feeding; but there are bounds, because the water\r\nis but small, and will not admit any great number: but if you have a\r\ngreat number of fish to be kept for an opportunity, and you put them\r\ninto a considerable water, you may in that manner stock to any quantity,\r\ntaking care duly to feed them; and so not only maintain, but improve\r\none thousand per acre; but if thus over-stocked, and you do not feed\r\nsufficiently, they will sink, and you be a great loser.\r\n\r\nNow, as for your stews, the care of feeding is best instructed to a\r\nbutler or gardener, who are or should be always at home, because the\r\nconstancy and regularity of serving the fish, conduce very much to their\r\nwell eating and thriving; for they will expect their meat as duly as\r\nhorses, and appetite in any creature wastes by disappointment.\r\n\r\nAny sort of grain boiled is good to feed with, especially malt coarse\r\nground. Pease boiled a turn or two are as good as any other grain. The\r\ngrains after a brewing, while they are good and sweet, are very proper;\r\nbut one bushel of malt not brewed, will go as far as two of grains. The\r\nchippings of bread, and orts of a table, steeped in tap-droppings of good\r\nstrong beer or ale, are very good food for carps. Of these the quantity\r\nof two quarts to thirty table carps every day is sufficient; and to feed\r\nmorning and evening, is better than once a day only.\r\n\r\nThe place to feed is towards the mouth, at about half yard deep; for that\r\nkeeps the deep clean and fit, as a parlour to retire to, and rest in. The\r\nmeat plainly thrown into the water, without other device, will be picked\r\nup by them, and nothing shall be lost. However, there are several ways to\r\ngive them meat, especially pease, which are useful, as a square board let\r\ndown, with the meat upon it, by the four corners, whence a string comes,\r\nand made fast to a stick like a scale, is very manageable. A gentleman\r\nhad found out a very facile way to feed carps, worth noting, because I\r\nhave heard it was successful. He let down the very kettle in which the\r\npease were boiled, into the water, and the fish would come and take out\r\nevery grain.\r\n\r\nWhen you feed in the greater waters, where the numbers are also great, it\r\nwill be a charge as well as trouble; but when you take out the fish, and\r\nsee how they are thriven, you will allow both well employed. Either malt\r\nboiled, or fresh grains, is the best food in this case: and what is not\r\nsupplied from your own house and brewings, you may take of neighbouring\r\nalehouses, who will be willing, for a small matter, to throw into the\r\nwater, at a place you shall assign, a certain quantity every brewing.\r\nThus carps may be fed and raised like capons. And tenches will feed in\r\nstews, as well as carps; but perch, as was said, are not for a stew in\r\nfeeding time.\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of food for fish, which I may call accidental, and is no\r\nless improving, than the best you can contrive; and that is, when the\r\nwaters happen to receive the wash of commons where many sheep are fed,\r\nthe water is enriched by the earth, and shall feed many more carps, than\r\notherwise it would. This is the case at Antlingham in Norfolk, where\r\nthere are ponds in a common that raise carp wonderfully, although the\r\nsoil be sandy and poor, and the waters seldom let out; and this earthy\r\nwash is the reason of it. When cattle are fed upon the pastures by your\r\ngreat waters, if they have access to them, in hot weather they will take\r\ndelight to stand in the water; the dung that falls from them, is also a\r\nvery great nourishment of fish.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, that about London the fishmongers have ways of making\r\ncarps fat by the offal of butchers shops and slaughter-houses; which I\r\ndo not at all recommend to others, if that were to be done, because a\r\nsudden filthy feeding can neither be wholesome nor sweet. But I have not\r\nobserved, that carps do in any sort delight in blood, nor indeed any\r\nother fish, except breams; and those will feed much upon new grains\r\nmixed with blood; so that if you will be at the charge of feeding them in\r\nstews, like carps, you may have large breams in six or seven years, which\r\nare a very slow grower, unless it be in springy waters.\r\n\r\nOne way of feeding fish is worth remembering, though not fit to be used\r\nin waters that you ever look upon. It is laying a dead carrion upon\r\nstakes in the middle of the water, and it will breed maggots, which\r\nfalling into the water, feed the fish very considerably; but I have not\r\nproved it.\r\n\r\nAs for pikes, the best food to raise them up to an extraordinary fatness\r\nis eels; and without them it is not to be done, but in a long time;\r\notherwise small perches are the best meat you can give them. And the\r\ncommon opinion, that pikes will not eat perches, because of their armed\r\nbacks, is a great mistake, as I have found by certain experience. Breams\r\nput into a pike-pond, will breed exceedingly, and are good enough to\r\nmaintain pikes, who will take care they shall not increase overmuch. And\r\nthe great fry of roaches and rouds that come from the greater waters,\r\nremoved into the quarters of your pikes, will be good diet for them.\r\n\r\nPikes in all waters, and carps in hungry springy waters, being fed at\r\ncertain times, will come up and take their meat almost from your hand;\r\nand it is diverting enough to see the greediness and striving that will\r\nbe amongst them for the good bits, and the boldness, that by constant and\r\nregular feeding, they will come to.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of disposing your Increase of Fish._\r\n\r\nThis care presseth when you employ your great waters; and unless you\r\nhave projected beforehand how you shall dispose your fish, you will find\r\nyourself in great disorder.\r\n\r\nAs for carps for the service of your house, and also tenches and perch\r\nfor winter, they are to be disposed into your stews. The rest of your\r\nfish, except the fry, you may put into the great water, and in March or\r\nApril after, with flews or trammels, take out good quantities to recruit\r\nyour winter’s expence taken from your stews; the fry goes to your pikes,\r\nexcept carps, tench, and perch, which may go to some of your auxiliary\r\nwaters to be raised, in order to become stores again when you want. And\r\nif, after all, you find your stock too high, you must feed as I have\r\nalready discoursed.\r\n\r\nBut you may contrive to keep your stock within compass; for you may\r\nenlarge the expence in your house, and gratify your family and friends\r\nthat visit you, with a dish as acceptable as any you can purchase for\r\nmoney; or you may oblige your friends and neighbours, by making presents\r\nof them, which, from the countryman to the king, is well taken; for many\r\nthat have waters, not being in a method of husbanding them, as well\r\nas others that have none, want and desire fish, and look upon such a\r\npresent, as of a rarity, valuing it not by your plenty, but their own\r\nscarcity. And where fish is plenty, it is a positive disgrace to appear\r\ncovetous of them, rather more than of venison, or any other thing; so\r\nthat presents are not only expedient, but necessary to be made by him\r\nthat professeth a mastery of fish.\r\n\r\nAnother way, more prudent, though in the account of shallow people,\r\nless reputable, is that of selling. If there were any colour for\r\ndisreputation in that matter, I should bestow some words upon it; but\r\nseeing it resides only among vain women, or women-like men, I let the\r\nhumour pass, and should as soon preach against the opinion of fairies\r\nand Robin-Goodfellow, as that. Only by the way, I presume to advise the\r\ncensorious sparks to do nothing unjust; let their dealing be plain,\r\nthough in selling of horses, spend what is their own, provide for their\r\nfamilies, and be true to their friend; and after this, whether they sell\r\ncorn, cattle, conies, sheep, deer, horses, or fish, I will insure their\r\nhonour for a farthing. It is the truth and substance of things, and no\r\nperson’s opinion, that governs honour, which consists wholly in doing\r\nwhat is truly just and good, and nothing otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis matter being dismissed, I proceed to direct the course to be taken\r\nwhen you propose to sell. First contract with the person you deal with\r\nfor a quantity; which, if for sale to eat, will be by the measure of\r\nso much per inch, for every inch above a foot; if for stores, then so\r\nmuch per hundred, or dozen, between certain lengths, as between nine\r\nand twelve, and seven and ten inches, to be delivered alive where it is\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nThis trade will be easy, if you are planted within forty miles of London,\r\nwhich will take off quantities for retailing, else it will be hard to\r\nfind contractors; but for stores, there will be some always beginning in\r\nfish, with whom you may deal; and so few will sedulously apply to the\r\nconduct of their waters, as is necessary to a command of fish, you need\r\nnot fear the country will be over-stocked. If the humour of living in the\r\ncountry once repossesseth the gentleman, there may be much more occasion\r\nfor stores than at present there is, because their seats are let to\r\ntenants, and the waters uncultivated.\r\n\r\nWhen you have contracted, you are at a certainty, and may proceed; for\r\nit is a great inconvenience to take and carry fish, and then be paid\r\nwith a wrangle; therefore let your terms be certain, and you can have no\r\ndispute, because all is to be declared by measure.\r\n\r\nYou will find your stews and auxiliary waters of great use to you upon\r\nsuch occasions; for you clap in what fish you please for fourteen or\r\nfifteen days; for instance, five or six hundred carps to a brace of\r\nstews, and they take no harm: if they continue longer, it is but feeding\r\nthem until they are fetched or carried away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of fishing for Carriage._\r\n\r\nAs for the particular ways and methods of taking fish, such as I have\r\ndealt in, is at present besides my design, though I may not perhaps\r\naltogether pass it by, so much as concerns the carriage of fish, which I\r\nlook upon as a considerable item in the managery as to profit, which I\r\nprincipally aim at, I shall now observe.\r\n\r\nWhen your fishing is in order to remove far, whether the waters are great\r\nor small, it must be done in winter, between the first of October, and\r\nthe last of March; and the colder the weather is, the better. One great\r\ncaution is, not to handle, or any way to batter or bruise them; for it\r\nis a great truth, and common sense speaks it, that fish battered and\r\nbruised, will not thrive upon transplanting, so well as others; therefore\r\nwhen your pond is drawn, and you come to the fish, take them out of the\r\nwater with hoop-nets fixed upon staves about ten feet long, and ten or\r\ntwelve fish at a time in a net is sufficient, though but a foot long;\r\nmore, by their weight and struggling, will damage each other insensibly,\r\nso as to hinder their growth and thrift, and perhaps be the cause that\r\nmany die. Let the fish be as little out of the water as may be; for\r\nwhen fouled, and almost choaked with mud, they will clean and recover\r\nthemselves with water, which freshen upon them often, till you come to\r\nput them up for carriage.\r\n\r\nIf you fish with nets, and make a great draught, as probably you will\r\nwhen the water is low, be not hasty to draw the fish upon the ground, but\r\nsecure them by taking the lead line upon the ground, and holding up the\r\ncork line, and so let them stir a little, they will be the cleaner; and\r\nthen take them out with hoop-nets, as before. And if there be occasion\r\nto keep them any time out of the water, let it be upon the grass, when\r\nthere is no sun, or else in the shade, for heat is the greatest enemy to\r\nthe life of fish out of water that can be.\r\n\r\nThe best vessel for conveyance (if you carry above twenty miles) is a\r\ngreat tun that holds five hogsheads; but if no more than ten, fifteen,\r\nor twenty miles, ordinary hogsheads will do well enough. I know by\r\nexperience you may safely carry three hundred carps, six and seven\r\ninches long, in one hogshead; but from seven to a foot, not so many by a\r\nfourth part. If they exceed a foot, then not above seventy or eighty in\r\na hogshead. Let every hogshead have ten or twelve pails of fresh clean\r\nwater (not well-water), every six or seven miles, if it may be had. There\r\nis no need of any great liberty for the fish, if their water be fresh,\r\nand often renewed; for one great use of the water is to bury the fish,\r\nthat with mere weight they might not crush and destroy one another.\r\n\r\nWhen you are arrived at the place of discharge, pour the fish into an\r\nhoop-net a few at a time, and dispose them forthwith where they are\r\ndesigned; and with this care you will scarce lose a fish.\r\n\r\nSome use to put up fish in baskets or hampers for carriage, stowing them\r\nwith grass between; but this is not so good as water, for the grass\r\ncleaving to the slime of the fish, rubs and cleans it from the scales;\r\nwhich done, a carp scarce ever thrives after. And although perhaps the\r\nfish may live, they will not grow or thrive, because their natural slime,\r\nscarce recoverable, is rubbed off; and for the same reason, it is not\r\ngood to let carps lie at all in grass, but keep them always in water, to\r\npreserve them from bruises, and losing their slime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Nurseries to Ponds and Fish._\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the fresher air and cleaner soil your water hath, the\r\nbetter fish thrive. Wood of any sort near the water is bad, not only from\r\nits hindering the wind and sun from purifying the water, but from the\r\nleaves falling in, and rotten wood; both which are pernicious to fish.\r\nBut osiers and willows may be allowed of, without much inconvenience.\r\nOak boards, or timber laid in water, as sometimes is done to season,\r\nwill in all probability destroy all your fish; and likewise hemp laid\r\nto rot; all which are therefore to be avoided. Dung-hills, stables, or\r\ncow-houses, permitted to drain into ponds, are very ill neighbours, and\r\nmost especially wash-houses, which certainly spoil a standing water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Frosts, and the Ways to save the Fish in them._\r\n\r\nThe great plague and bane of fish in moats, great and small, and other\r\nlittle standing waters, are great and sharp frosts. I have used all the\r\ntricks that I have heard of, which are not a few, or could devise, to\r\nsave my fish in such waters; and yet in ten years time I have lost three\r\nor four thousand carps. But yet I have found ways to save the life of\r\nmany a fair carp, when my neighbours have lost all; which I shall declare\r\nas my own experience, and may be profitable upon like occasions to any\r\nthat will use them.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the sorts of fish that suffer most, I can only say, that\r\nthe tench, if any, is frost-proof, and will shift in extremity; but if\r\nthe frost be intense and long, the other sorts, as carps, eels, pike,\r\nperch, and roach, will go near to perish; and I have found not any great\r\ndifference of hardness, but when one fish complains, they are all in\r\nimminent danger.\r\n\r\nThe waters most obnoxious to frosts are such as are standing, shallow, or\r\nsmall. For if there be either a water-current, or a fresh spring, no fish\r\ndies for frost. If an hard winter succeeds a very dry summer, the fish\r\nsuffers most. If the ponds are large and deep, such as I have directed to\r\nbe made upon the channel of water, which may not run but upon floods or\r\nrain, the fish will never die in frost there; but such waters you must\r\nlook upon as the asylum for the securing the fish in extremity; and all\r\nthat you can put in there alive, though through a hole in the ice, will\r\ncertainly live. If the bank of a pond sews, it will preserve the fish in\r\nfrost; the reason, as I imagine, is, because where the water sews out,\r\nthe air will bubble in, which relieves the fish; or perhaps it might put\r\nthe water into some degree of motion. If so, the stirring water with a\r\nboard flat upon a pole put under the ice, might do good; but this is\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nThe symptom of mortality to your fish in time of frost, is, their shewing\r\nthemselves; which if you perceive in the least, conclude all are going;\r\nand without a thaw, that water will not keep them alive. For it is the\r\nnature of fish in cold weather to lie as close and deep as they can; so\r\nthat nothing but the pangs of death shall make them move. If no holes are\r\nbroke, they will rise and stick to the ice, and be frozen to it; if there\r\nbe holes, they will move about them, as if they came up for fresh air.\r\n\r\nWhen the frost hath continued long, and hard, that you begin to suspect\r\nyour fish, you may make a trial by cutting holes in several places, some\r\nin the middle, and some by the sides of the waters that are obnoxious;\r\nthat is, after about ten days freezing; and by the appearing of the\r\nfish, or not, you shall discover the temper and condition they are in;\r\ntherefore watch them diligently. If they are not well, they will appear;\r\nthen prepare all hands to take out every fish, as near as you can; for\r\nwhat you take out, you may preserve, and all that are left behind, are\r\nprobably lost.\r\n\r\nMany use to break holes to relieve the fish, and, as they think, give\r\nthem fresh air; some have put dung bound up together into the holes, as\r\nif the warmth of that keeping the hole open would preserve the fish;\r\nbut these ways, and all others that I have heard of, except taking out\r\nthe fish, are mere vanities. I have cut many holes, and large ones,\r\nand employed men to take out the ice, and keep them open, but to no\r\nadvantage. One thing appeared very oddly to me, when I took that course.\r\nMany of the fish in a large moat had gathered together in a corner\r\nobverted to the South, where the ground rose under an high bank, to a\r\nshoal-water. These fish, by their motion and heat, together with the\r\nsun’s heat, that was strongest there, kept the water from freezing, and\r\nI could plainly see every fish, great and small. There were carp, pike,\r\nperch, eels, and fry in abundance, collected as if it had been a general\r\ncounsel of all the orders of fish, met to consider what was to be done in\r\nthat extremity, very diverting to observe.\r\n\r\nBut to leave conceits, and come to the only expedient which I have found\r\neffectual to save the fish in this case; and that is, to set great tubs\r\nor fats full of water in some outhouse, not far from a fire; and as fast\r\nas the fish appear, take them out, and put them there; and from thence\r\nyou may convey them in a basket to your great waters, where you may make\r\nan hole at about eight feet deep, and putting the fish in, preserve them;\r\nor if you please, you may keep them there, freshening the water every\r\ntwelve hours, until the frost breaks, and put them into their own houses\r\nagain. You may plainly perceive how the fish, though stunned and numb\r\nwith the frost, coming into the fat, will by degrees recover, and be\r\nperfectly well again; and thus you may keep them five weeks, or longer,\r\nif the frost continues.\r\n\r\nI have gone farther: sometimes fish have been to all appearance dead,\r\nothers frozen and inveloped in ice, yet by this method I have preserved\r\nthem; for heating water, and putting it into the fat, until I brought\r\nthe water there to a Midsummer heat, and then I have put such fish in,\r\nwith their shell of ice upon them, and in six or seven hours the ice was\r\ngone, and the fish alive and well; and so I have delivered them to my\r\ngreat waters, brisk as any.\r\n\r\nThis may seem strange, but it is most true, and to be attested, if need\r\nwere; therefore in frost use this and no other means, for all else will\r\nprove but labour in vain.\r\n\r\nIn small waters, where is the greatest danger of frost, observe never\r\nto put in stock, but the last week of February, or beginning of March;\r\nfor then they take less hurt in removing, and they may be taken out in\r\nOctober after, and so all hazard of frost prevented; and if you venture\r\nthem there one winter, be sure never let them run the hazard of another.\r\nSo you have two summers feed, which will raise a carp from store to the\r\ntable, and venture but one winter’s frost; and in winter they neither\r\nfeed nor grow any thing considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the ordinary Benefits and Improvements by Fish._\r\n\r\nThese were touched when I spoke of disposing the increase of fish; that\r\nis, furnishing your table, obliging your friends, and raising money. I\r\nshall only add to the last, that it is most reasonable, if it can be\r\ncontrived, that pleasures pay for the charge of them. Then what is more\r\njustifiable, than to make ponds yield a profit to answer the great\r\ncharge in making them?\r\n\r\nBut we must go farther: ground shall be vastly improved by fish, and\r\nshall be intrinsically worth, and yield more this way, than by any other\r\nemployment you can give it: for suppose it meadow of two pounds per acre\r\n(which is an high value for the best meadow far from London), I will\r\njustify, that four acres in pond shall return you every year one thousand\r\ncarps fed up, from — to fourteen or fifteen inches, besides pikes, perch,\r\nand tench, and other fry, useful on many accounts, if the water suits\r\nthem. The carps are saleable, and will bring perhaps twelve pence, but in\r\nall likelihood not less than nine pence; yet, let it be six pence apiece,\r\nthere is twenty-five pounds, which is six pounds five shillings per acre;\r\na little charge of carriage perhaps to be deducted. This is improvement\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nBut lay aside profit, and consider how a gentleman should entertain\r\nhimself and his family, which I must suppose every one hath, who lives\r\nupon an estate, and it may be numerous; he must find some sort of\r\ndiversion for them. Must it be altogether going abroad to make, or at\r\nhome receiving visits? Or if the female part are so grave, to decline\r\nthat course of life, must they always be within? Or if they stir out,\r\nhave nothing but mere air to invite them? Perhaps the gentleman himself\r\nmay find diversion by hunting, &c. and meeting company upon several\r\ndiverting accounts; and shall all his entertainments be exclusive of his\r\nfamily? No, certainly; whoever aims at an easy and satisfactory course\r\nof life, must seek that his family, as well as himself, be pleased: and\r\nif he doth not order it so that they shall be entertained, it is ten to\r\none they will find such entertainments as shall not be very grateful to\r\nhim; therefore there is advantage enough in the mastery of fish, from the\r\ndiversion, not to speak of the employment that it brings to a family.\r\nYoung people love angling extremely; then there is a boat, which gives\r\npleasure enough in summer, frequent fishing with nets, the very making of\r\nnets, seeing the waters, much discourse of them, and the fish, especially\r\nupon your great sweeps, and the strange surprizes that will happen in\r\nnumbers and bigness, with many other incident entertainments, are the\r\nresult of waters, and direct the minds of a numerous family to terminate\r\nin something not inconvenient, and, it may be, divert them from worse.\r\nParks, bowling-greens, and billiard-tables, are of the same design; but\r\nit will be easily granted, this of fish is beyond them all.\r\n\r\nIf it be said, that this is not a pleasure, it is all care and pains,\r\nespecially to him that is the master, who must be perpetually vexed at\r\nthe negligence and blockishness of servants, that will never perform\r\nwhat he expects and orders: I answer, that is a good reason for leaving\r\nthe world. The plague of servants is the same in all business, wherein\r\nyou use and depend upon them; therefore, to be rid of it, give away\r\nyour estate, retire, and be an hermit: and even then you shall find the\r\ngnawing of your own mind a more perverse evil, than all the business,\r\nservants, with the crosses and vexations attending them. We were not\r\nmade perfect, but must live in perpetual disease; the only point is,\r\nwhich way to lessen it; and that must be by employment, which diverts the\r\nsense of our innate misery. What can be a greater torture, than to live\r\nchained to a bed, though the best in the world, and have no company nor\r\nbusiness? Therefore court business, if you would pass for an epicurean,\r\nand let it be such as brings comfort to nature, and not pain and torment\r\nin the consequence; that is to say, lawful, profitable, obliging, and\r\ntemperate. So you avoid offending the publick, increase your store, win\r\nyour friends and family, and preserve your health; all which, I take it,\r\nare accomplished, in great measure, by the mastery of fish.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the vending of fish, observe that it is best to be content\r\nwith the market price, as you can find it, as most are for other vendible\r\ncommodities; and for carps between thirteen or fourteen, or sixteen\r\ninches, measuring from nose-end to tail-end, twelve pence is a good\r\nprice; selling to the nobility or gentry, may produce one penny more, and\r\nmay measure up to seventeen; but never promise above twenty turned of\r\nsixteen in twelve score.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Benefits, besides the main Design._\r\n\r\nThese are many, and not inconsiderable; as first, when you make a great\r\nwater, you take the first spit of the ground upon which the bank is to\r\nstand, and from the pan of the pond. In case you take earth there for the\r\nbank, and this you carry to some place where it is most easily removed\r\nupon your tillage-ground, and there let it lie to rot the sod, and then\r\nthere is not a better manure, and more than pays the charge of digging\r\nand carrying it.\r\n\r\n2. You gain the making of stews, and, it may be, other ponds for the\r\nconvenience of your cattle, all under one charge: for if you must dig\r\nclay and earth for your bank, it is as easily taken where it doth this,\r\nas otherwise.\r\n\r\n3. If the soil about the waters be any thing moorish, it may be planted\r\nwith osiers, which yield a certain yearly crop.\r\n\r\n4. The feed of the pond when laid dry, or the corn, that is, oats, which\r\nyou may have upon the bottom, though mere mud, is very considerable. This\r\nhath been touched before.\r\n\r\n5. You will invite all manner of help to your fishing, by the fry given\r\namong those who assist you; and though you pay them, they will expect\r\nfish; and with expectations of carrying home a dish of fresh fish, men\r\nwill work in wet and dirt, to a wonder, without other pay.\r\n\r\n6. If you graze cattle near your great waters, they will delight to\r\ncome and stand in the water; and it conduceth much to the thrift of\r\nyour cattle, as well as the feed of your fish, which is much supplied\r\nby the dunging of the cattle; and therefore it is good to have ponds in\r\ncow-pastures and grazing grounds.\r\n\r\nAs to the sowing of oats in the bottom of a pond, observe to dry your\r\ngreat water once in three, or at most four years, and that at the end of\r\nJanuary, or beginning of March; which, if not a very unreasonable year,\r\nwill be time enough. After Michaelmas following, you may put in a very\r\ngreat stock; and thin them in following years, as the feed will decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThus I have given, as short and intelligibly as conveniently I could, the\r\nbest of my knowledge, contracted by twenty years practice and experience,\r\nof fish and waters: and if I am so happy thereby, to contribute in the\r\nleast to the satisfaction or diversion of my friends, it will extremely\r\ncontent, if not encourage me to add somewhat farther concerning the\r\nnature of the several sorts of fish I deal in, the ways of taking them,\r\nof nets, angling, engines for clearing waters, and other particularities\r\nthat I have proved. In the mean time, they may command these as myself,\r\nboth being alike open, considerable, and at their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Barbel                                             Page 5\r\n\r\n    Carp                                                        7\r\n\r\n    The Chub                                                   11\r\n\r\n    The Cod Fish                                               13\r\n\r\n    The Haddock                                                14\r\n\r\n    The Herring                                                16\r\n\r\n    The Mackarel                                               20\r\n\r\n    The Mullet                                                 21\r\n\r\n    The Pearch, or Perch,                                      23\r\n\r\n    The Pike                                                   24\r\n\r\n    The Roach                                                  25\r\n\r\n    The Shad                                                   26\r\n\r\n    The Tench                                                  28\r\n\r\n    The Trout                                                  29\r\n\r\n    The Whiting                                                31\r\n\r\n    A Discourse of Fish and Fish Ponds                         33\r\n\r\n    Of the Situation and Disposition of the Principal Waters   35\r\n\r\n    Of the Manner of making and raising Pond Heads             33\r\n\r\n    The Dimensions of Pond Heads                               34\r\n\r\n    Of securing your Banks                                     35\r\n\r\n    Of Sluices                                                 37\r\n\r\n    Of the Manner of Working to raise a Pond Head              39\r\n\r\n    Of Auxiliary Waters                                        42\r\n\r\n    Of Stews                                                   43\r\n\r\n    Of Moats                                                   45\r\n\r\n    Of other Auxiliary Waters                                  49\r\n\r\n    The Course of laying the great Waters dry                  51\r\n\r\n    Of Breeding of Fish                                        53\r\n\r\n    The Manner of Stocking Waters                              55\r\n\r\n    Of the Manner of feeding Fish                              60\r\n\r\n    Of disposing your Increase of Fish                         64\r\n\r\n    Of fishing for Carriage                                    66\r\n\r\n    Of Nurseries to Ponds and Fish                             69\r\n\r\n    Of Frosts, and the Way to save the Fish in them            ib.\r\n\r\n    Of the ordinary Benefits and Improvements by Fish          73\r\n\r\n    Of Benefits besides the main Design                        76\r\n\r\n    The Conclusion                                             78\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._",
