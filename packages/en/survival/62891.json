The Editor\r\nhas laboured to carry out the intentions of the Author in rendering\r\nthis part of the Work as complete a compendium as possible of the\r\nPalæontological history of the Organic Beings of which it treats, and\r\nin adapting it to the requirements of the Geological Student of the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe various sources from which palæontological and zoological\r\ninformation has been derived have, for the most part, been adverted to\r\nin the text or in the footnotes. The Editor, however, has especially\r\nto acknowledge the kindness of Mr. J. Morris, F.G.S., in allowing\r\nhim to refer to the proof-sheets of the forth-coming edition of his\r\n\"Catalogue of British Fossils,\" and thereby affording him important\r\nassistance in making correct statements of the distribution of the\r\nFossil Remains of the Crustacea, Insecta, and Vertebrata, in the strata\r\nof the British Islands.\r\n\r\n  T. Rupert Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of the Wonders of Geology, an intention was\r\nexpressed of immediately publishing, as a sequel to those volumes,\r\n\"First Lessons,\" or an Introduction to the Study of Petrifactions, for\r\npersons wholly unacquainted with the nature of Fossil Remains; but the\r\ncompletion of the contemplated work was unavoidably postponed, from\r\nyear to year, by the long and severe indisposition of the Author.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile several works professing the same object have issued\r\nfrom the press; and an enlarged edition of Sir C. Lyell's \"Elements\"\r\nhas also appeared, in which the elementary principles of physical\r\nGeology are fully illustrated, and numerous figures given of the\r\ncharacteristic fossils of the several formations, or groups of strata.\r\nBut that department of the science which especially treats of Organic\r\nRemains is necessarily considered in a cursory manner; and a work\r\nupon the plan originally contemplated by the Author seems still to be\r\nrequired, to initiate the young and uninstructed in the study of those\r\nMedals of Creation--those electrotypes of nature--the mineralized\r\nremains of the plants and animals which successively flourished in the\r\nearlier ages of our planet, in periods incalculably remote, and long\r\nantecedent to all human history and tradition.\r\n\r\nWith this conviction the present volumes are offered, with such\r\nmodifications of the original plan as circumstances have rendered\r\nnecessary, as a guide for the Student and the Amateur Collector of\r\nfossil remains; for the intelligent Observer who may desire to possess\r\na general knowledge of the subject, without intending to pursue\r\nGeology as a science; and for the Tourist who may wish, in the course\r\nof his travels, to employ profitably a leisure hour in quest of those\r\ninteresting memorials of the ancient physical revolutions of our globe,\r\nwhich he will find everywhere presented to his observation.\r\n\r\nCrescent Lodge, Clapham Common, _May_, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Some books are to be tasted--others to be swallowed--and some few to\r\nbe chewed and digested; that is, some Books are to be read only in\r\nparts--others to be read, but not curiously--and some few to be read\r\nwholly and with diligence and attention.\"--Lord Bacon's Essays.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxious that the \"Courteous Reader\" should derive from this work all\r\nthe information it is designed to impart, the Author presumes to\r\noffer a few words in explanation of the plan upon which it has been\r\nconstructed, and some suggestions as to the best means of rendering its\r\ncontents most available to the varied tastes and pursuits of different\r\nclasses of readers.\r\n\r\nIn its arrangement, a three-fold object was had in view; namely, in the\r\nfirst place, to present such an epitome of Palæontology, the science\r\nwhich treats of the fossil remains of the ancient inhabitants of the\r\nGlobe, as shall enable the intelligent Observer to comprehend the\r\nnature of the principal discoveries in modern Geology, and the method\r\nof investigation by which such highly interesting, and unexpected\r\nresults, have been obtained..\r\n\r\nSecondly, to assist the Collector in his search for Organic\r\nRemains,--directing attention to those objects which possess\r\nthe highest interest, and are especially deserving of accurate\r\nexamination--instructing him in the art of developing and preserving\r\nthe specimens he may discover--and pointing out the means to be\r\npursued, for ascertaining their nature, and their relation to existing\r\nplants or animals.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to place before the Student a familiar exposition of the\r\nelementary principles of Palæontology, based upon a general knowledge\r\nof the structure of vegetable and animal organization; to excite in his\r\nmind a desire for further information, and prepare him for the perusal\r\nand study of works of a higher order than these unpretending volumes;\r\nand to point out the sources from which the required instruction may be\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nAlthough fully aware of the imperfect manner in which these intentions\r\nare fulfilled, the Author hopes that the indulgence claimed by one of\r\nthe most able writers of our times may be extended to him; and that,\r\n\"if the design be good upon the whole, the work will not be censured\r\ntoo severely for those faults, from which, in parts, its very nature\r\nwould scarcely allow it to be free.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Sir E. B. Lytton--preface to the second edition of \"The Disowned.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the best means of making use of these volumes, the\r\nadvice of the great founder of Inductive Philosophy, on the Study of\r\nBooks in general, expressed in the quotation prefixed to this address,\r\nis peculiarly applicable to the different classes of readers for whom\r\nthe work is designed.\r\n\r\nThus, \"_the Book may be tasted, that is, read only in parts_,\" by the\r\nintelligent reader, who requires but a general acquaintance with the\r\nsubjects it embraces. The perusal of the introductory and concluding\r\nremarks of each chapter, of the general descriptions of fossil\r\nremains, and of the circumstances under which they occur,--omitting the\r\nscientific terms and descriptions,--and a cursory examination of the\r\nillustrations, will probably satisfy his curiosity; and the work may\r\nbe transferred to the library for occasional reference, or taken as a\r\ntravelling companion and guide to some interesting geological district.\r\n\r\nBut the Book \"_must be swallowed, that is, read, but not curiously_,\"\r\nby the reader desirous of forming a collection of organic remains. A\r\ngeneral acquaintance with its contents, and a careful investigation\r\nof the characters of the fossils, and comparison with the figures and\r\ndescriptions, will be requisite to enable the amateur collector to\r\ndetermine the nature of the specimens he may discover.\r\n\r\nBy the Student the Book \"_must be digested, that is, read wholly, and\r\nwith diligence and attention_.\" He should fully comprehend one subject\r\nbefore he advances to the consideration of another, and should test\r\nthe solidity of his knowledge by practical research. He should visit\r\nsome of the localities described; collect specimens, and develope\r\nthem with his own hands; examine their structure microscopically;\r\nnor rest satisfied until he has determined their general characters,\r\nand ascertained their generic and specific relations. Nor is this an\r\narduous or irksome task; by a moderate degree of attention, a mind\r\nof average ability may quickly overcome the apparent difficulties,\r\nand will find in the knowledge thus acquired, and in the accession of\r\nmental vigour which such investigations never fail to impart, an ample\r\nreward for any expenditure of time and trouble.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, within the power of every intelligent reader, by\r\nassiduity and perseverance, to attain the high privilege of those who\r\nwalk in the midst of wonders, in circumstances where the uninformed and\r\nuninquiring eye can perceive neither novelty nor beauty; and of being\r\n\r\n                       \"Even as one,\r\n      Who by some secret gift of soul or eye,\r\n    In every spot beneath the smiling sun.\r\n      _Sees where the Springs of living Waters lie!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                               ~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n                                VOL.

W. Herschel._\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology, a term signifying a discourse on the Earth, (from two Greek\r\nwords: viz. γἡ, _ge_, the earth; and λὁγος, _logos_, a discourse,) is\r\nthe science which treats of the physical structure of the planet on\r\nwhich we live, and of the nature and causes of the successive changes\r\nwhich have taken place in the organic and inorganic kingdoms, from\r\nthe remotest period to the present time, and is therefore intimately\r\nconnected with every department of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhile in common with other scientific pursuits it yields the noblest\r\nand purest pleasures of which the human mind is susceptible, it has\r\npeculiar claims on our attention, since it offers inexhaustible and\r\nvaried fields of intellectual research, and its cultivation, beyond\r\nthat of any other science, is in a great measure independent of\r\nexternal circumstances; for it can be followed in whatever condition\r\nof life we maybe placed, and wherever our fortunes may lead us.\r\n\r\nThe eulogium passed by a distinguished living philosopher on scientific\r\nknowledge in general, is strikingly applicable to geological\r\ninvestigations. \"The highest worldly-prosperity, so far from being\r\nincompatible with them, supplies additional advantages for their\r\npursuit; they may be alike enjoyed in the intervals of the most\r\nactive business, while the calm and dispassionate interest with which\r\nthey fill the mind, renders them a most delightful retreat from the\r\nagitations and dissensions of the world, and from the conflict of\r\npassions, prejudices, and interests, in which the man of business finds\r\nhimself continually involved.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Sir J. F. W. Herschel, \"Discourse on the Study of Natural\r\nPhilosophy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the present advanced state of geological science, particularly\r\nof that department which it is the more especial object of these\r\nvolumes to elucidate, namely Palæontology,[3] or the study of Organic\r\nRemains,--it seems scarcely credible, that but little more than a\r\ncentury ago it was a matter of serious question with naturalists,\r\nwhether the petrified shells imbedded in the rocks and strata were\r\nindeed shells that had been secreted by molluscous animals; or whether\r\nthese bodies, together with the teeth, bones, leaves, wood, &c. found\r\nin a fossil state, were not formed by what was then termed the plastic\r\npower of the earth; in like manner as minerals, metals, and crystals.\r\n\r\n[3] Palæontology: from παλαιος, _palaios_, ancient--οντα, _onta_,\r\nbeings--λὁγος, _logos_, a discourse.\r\n\r\nIn a \"Natural History of England,\" published towards the end of the\r\nlast century, it is gravely observed that at Bethersden in Kent, a\r\nkind of stone is found full of shells, \"_which is a proof that shells\r\nand the animals we find in them living, have no necessary connexion_.\"\r\nAnother amusing instance of the ignorance on such subjects which\r\nprevailed at no remote period, occurs in a \"History of the County\r\nof Surrey,\" in which it is stated that in a search for coal near\r\nGuildford the borers broke, and \"this was thought by Mr. Peter Lely,\r\nthe Astrologer, to have been the work of subterranean spirits, who\r\nwrenched off the augers of the miners, lest their secret haunts should\r\nbe invaded.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the latter part of the seventeenth century, there were several\r\neminent men in England who were greatly in advance of the age in\r\nwhich they lived, and strenuously exerted themselves to discover and\r\npromulgate the true principles of Geology. Among these, Dr. Martin\r\nLister, physician to Queen Anne, was one of the most distinguished.\r\nThis accomplished naturalist, in his great work on shells, which\r\nremains to this day a splendid monument of his labours, and of the\r\ntalents and filial affection of his two daughters, by whom all the\r\nplates were engraved, figures and describes many fossil shells as real\r\nanimal productions, and carefully compares them with recent species.\r\nHe also recognised the distinction of strata by the organic remains\r\nthey contain; and to him the honour is due of having first suggested\r\nthe construction of geological maps;[4] he was likewise well acquainted\r\nwith the position and extent of the Chalk and other strata of the South\r\nof England.[5]\r\n\r\n[4] See Notes on the Progress of Geology in England, by W. H. Fitton,\r\nM.D. &c. _Philos. Mag._ vols. i. and ii. for 1832 and 1833.\r\n\r\n[5] This celebrated physician and British geologist died in 1712, and\r\nwas interred in the old church at Clapham; where a tablet to his memory\r\nis affixed to the outside of the north wall of St. Paul's Chapel.\r\n\r\nFrom the foreign writers, who at an early period had obtained some\r\ncorrect notions of the structure of our planet, and of the nature of\r\nthe revolutions it had undergone, I select the following beautiful\r\nand philosophical illustration of the physical mutations to which the\r\nsurface of the earth is perpetually subjected. It is from an Arabic\r\nmanuscript of the thirteenth century;[6] the narrative is supposed to\r\nbe related by Rhidhz, an allegorical personage.\r\n\r\n[6] Quoted by Sir C. Lyell in his \"Principles of Geology.\"\r\n\r\n \"I passed one day by a very ancient and populous city, and I asked\r\n one of its inhabitants how long it had been founded? 'It is, indeed,\r\n a mighty city,' replied he; 'we know not how long it has existed,\r\n and our ancestors were on this subject as ignorant as ourselves.'\r\n Some centuries afterwards I passed by the same place, but I could\r\n not perceive the slightest vestige of the city; and I demanded of a\r\n peasant, who was gathering herbs upon its former site, how long it\r\n had been destroyed? 'In sooth, a strange question,' replied he, 'the\r\n ground here has never been different from what you now behold it.'\r\n 'Was there not,' said I, 'of old a splendid city here?' 'Never,'\r\n answered he, 'so far as we know, and never did our fathers speak to us\r\n of any such.'\r\n\r\n \"On revisiting the spot, after the lapse of other centuries, I\r\n found the sea in the same place, and on its shores were a party of\r\n fishermen, of whom I asked how long the land had been covered by the\r\n waters? 'Is this a question,' said they, 'for a man like you? this\r\n spot has always been what it is now.'\r\n\r\n \"I again returned ages afterwards, and the sea had disappeared. I\r\n inquired of a man who stood alone upon the ground, how long ago the\r\n change had taken place, and he gave me the same answer that I had\r\n received before.\r\n\r\n \"Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I found\r\n there a flourishing city, more populous and more rich in buildings\r\n than the city I had seen the first time; and when I fain would have\r\n informed myself regarding its origin, the inhabitants answered me,\r\n 'Its rise is lost in remote antiquity--we are ignorant how long it\r\n has existed, and our fathers were on this subject no wiser than\r\n ourselves.'\"\r\n\r\nWe may smile at the ignorance of the inhabitants of the fabled cities,\r\nbut are we in a condition to give a more satisfactory reply should it\r\nbe inquired of us, \"What are the physical changes which the country you\r\ninhabit has undergone?\"--and yet cautious observation, and patient and\r\nunprejudiced investigation, are alone necessary to enable us to answer\r\nthe interrogation.\r\n\r\nDismissing from his mind all preconceived opinions, the student must\r\nbe prepared to learn that the earth's surface has been, and still is,\r\nsubject to perpetual mutation,--that the sea and land are continually\r\nchanging place,--that what is now dry land was once the bottom of the\r\ndeep, and that the bed of the present ocean will, in its turn, be\r\nelevated above the water and become land,--that all the solid materials\r\nof the globe have been in a softened, fluid, or gaseous state,--that\r\nthe relics of countless myriads of animals and plants are entombed in\r\nthe rocks and strata,--and that vast mountain-chains, and extensive\r\nregions, are wholly composed of the petrified remains of beings that\r\nlived and died in periods long antecedent to the creation of the human\r\nrace. Astounding as are these propositions, they rest upon evidence\r\nso clear and incontrovertible, that they cannot fail to be admitted\r\nby every intelligent and unprejudiced reader, who will bestow but a\r\nmoderate share of attention to the examination of the phenomena, of\r\nwhich the following pages present a familiar exposition.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude these introductory observations, without adverting\r\nto the incalculable benefits which result from scientific pursuits in\r\ngeneral, and of Geology in particular. An able modern writer has justly\r\nremarked:--\"It is fearfully true, that nine-tenths of the immorality\r\nwhich pervades the better classes of society, originate from the want\r\nof an interesting occupation to fill up the vacant time; and as the\r\nstudy of the natural sciences is as attractive as it is beneficial, it\r\nmust necessarily exert a moral and even religious influence upon the\r\nyoung and inquiring mind. The youth who is fond of scientific pursuits\r\nwill not enter into revelry, for frivolous or vicious excitements will\r\nhave no fascination for him. The overflowing cup, the unmeaning or\r\ndishonest game, will not entice him. If any one doubts the beneficial\r\ninfluence of these studies on the morals and character, I would ask him\r\nto point out the immoral young man who is devotedly attached to any\r\nbranch of natural science: I never knew such an one. There may be such\r\nindividuals--for religion only can change the heart--but if there be,\r\nthey are very rare exceptions; and the loud clamours which are always\r\nraised against the man of science who errs, prove how rarely the study\r\nof the works of the Creator fails to exert an ennobling effect upon a\r\nwell-regulated mind. Fortunate, indeed, are the youth of either sex,\r\nwho early imbibe a taste for natural knowledge, and whose predilections\r\nare not thwarted by injudicious friends.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while Geology exerts this hallowing influence on the character, it\r\npossesses the great advantage of presenting subjects adapted to every\r\ncapacity; on some of its investigations the highest intellectual powers\r\nand the most profound acquirements in exact science are required; while\r\nmany of its problems may be solved by any one who has eyes and will use\r\nthem; and innumerable facts illustrative of the ancient condition of\r\nour planet, and of its inhabitants, may be gathered by any diligent and\r\nintelligent observer.\r\n\r\nBut it is surely unnecessary to dwell on the interest and importance\r\nof a study, which instructs us that every pebble we tread upon bears\r\nthe impress of the Almighty's hand, and affords evidence of Creative\r\nwisdom; that every grain of sand, every particle of dust scattered\r\nby the wind, may be composed of the aggregated skeletons of beings,\r\nso minute as to elude our unassisted vision, but which possessed an\r\norganization as marvellous as our own;--a science whose discoveries\r\nhave realized the wildest imaginings of the poet,--whose realities\r\nfar surpass in grandeur and sublimity the most imposing fictions\r\nof romance;--a science, whose empire is the earth, the ocean, the\r\natmosphere, the heavens;--whose speculations embrace all elements,\r\nall space, all time;--objects the most minute, objects the most\r\ncolossal;--carrying its researches into the smallest atom which\r\nthe microscope can render accessible to our visual organs,--and\r\ncomprehending all the phenomena in the boundless Universe, which the\r\npowers of the telescope can reveal.\r\n\r\nAnd as no branch of natural philosophy can more strongly impress\r\nthe mind with that deep sense of humility and dependence, which\r\nthe contemplation of the works of the Eternal is calculated to\r\ninspire, so none can more powerfully encourage our aspirations after\r\ntruth and wisdom. Every walk we take offers subjects for profound\r\nmeditation,--every pebble that attracts our notice, matter for serious\r\nreflection; and contemplating the incessant dissolution and renovation\r\nwhich are taking place around us in the organic and inorganic kingdoms\r\nof nature, we are struck with the force and beauty of the exclamation\r\nof the poet--\r\n\r\n    My heart is awed within me, when I think\r\n    Of the great miracle which still goes on\r\n    In silence round me--the perpetual work\r\n    Of Thy Creation, finished, yet renewed\r\n    For ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PLAN OF THE WORK, AND THE ARRANGEMENT AND SUBDIVISION OF THE\r\nSUBJECTS IT EMBRACES.\r\n\r\nWith the view of economizing space, I would refer the reader to the\r\nfollowing volumes for figures and descriptions of such fossils as are\r\nillustrated therein: by this arrangement I hope to afford the student a\r\ncomprehensive view of Palæontology, and yet restrict this work within\r\nthe limits which as a manual it would be inconvenient to exceed; at the\r\nsame time it will be complete in itself, and afford all the information\r\nrequired by the amateur collector and general reader.\r\n\r\nI. Dr. Buckland's _Bridgewater Treatise_: 2 vols. 8vo.--These volumes\r\ncontain numerous excellent figures of organic remains; and as the work\r\nis, or ought to be, found in every good public or private library in\r\nthe kingdom, it will be accessible to most of my readers.\r\n\r\nII. _The Wonders of Geology, or a Familiar Exposition of Geological\r\nPhenomena_; _sixth_ edition, in two vols, with coloured plates, and\r\nnumerous figures; by the Author.

Some idea may be formed of the large\r\nproportion of the solid materials of the globe that has unquestionably\r\noriginated from this source, by a reference to the list of strata\r\nwhich are wholly, or in great part, composed of animal and vegetable\r\nstructures, given in the \"Wonders of Geology,\" p. 888.\r\n\r\nThere are also immense tracts of country that consist in a great\r\nmeasure of the remains of plants in the state of anthracite, coal,\r\nlignite, &c.; and districts covered with peat-bogs and subterranean\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nAlthough these relics of animal and vegetable organisms are found in\r\nalmost every sedimentary deposit, yet they occur far more abundantly,\r\nand in a better state of preservation, in some strata than in others:\r\nnor are they equally distributed throughout the same bed, but are\r\nheaped together in particular localities, and occur but sparingly,\r\nor are altogether absent, in other layers of the same rock. Neither\r\nare the remains of the same kinds of animals and plants found\r\nindiscriminately in strata of different ages: on the contrary, many\r\nspecies are restricted to the most ancient, others to the most recent\r\nformations; while some genera range through the entire series of\r\ndeposits, and also appear as denizens of the existing seas. Hence\r\norganic remains acquire a high degree of importance, not only from\r\nthe intrinsic interest they possess as objects of natural history, but\r\nalso for the light they shed on the physical condition of our planet in\r\nthe remotest ages, and for the data they afford as to the successive\r\nphysical revolutions which the surface of the earth has undergone.\r\n\r\nFossils have been eloquently and appropriately termed Medals\r\nof Creation; for as an accomplished numismatist, even when the\r\ninscription of an ancient and unknown coin is illegible, can from the\r\nhalf-obliterated effigy, and from the style of art, determine with\r\nprecision the people by whom, and the period when, it was struck;\r\nin like manner the geologist can decipher these natural memorials,\r\ninterpret the hieroglyphics with which they are inscribed, and from\r\napparently the most insignificant relics, trace the history of beings\r\nof whom no other records are extant, and ascertain the forms and habits\r\nof unknown types of organization whose races were swept from the face\r\nof the earth, ere the creation of man and the creatures which are his\r\ncontemporaries. Well might the illustrious Bergman exclaim, \"_Sunt\r\ninstar nummorum memorialium, quæ de præteritis globi nostri fatis\r\ntestantur, ubi omnia silent monumenta historica_.\"\r\n\r\nTo derive from these Medals of Creation all the information they are\r\ncapable of affording, regard therefore must be had not only to their\r\npeculiar characters, but also to the geological relations of the\r\nstrata in which they are imbedded. Data may be thus obtained by which\r\nthe relative age of a formation or group of strata can be determined,\r\nas well as the mode of deposition, and the agency by which it was\r\neffected; whether in the bed of an ocean, or of a lake, or estuary,--by\r\nthe action of the sea, or of rivers, or running streams,--by the\r\neffects of icebergs or glaciers,--by slow processes through long\r\nperiods of time, or by sudden inundations or deluges,--or by the agency\r\nof volcanoes and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that particular fossils are confined to certain deposits,\r\nwas soon productive of important results, which greatly tended to the\r\nadvancement of modern Geology; for although Dr. Lister, more than a\r\ncentury before, had obtained a glimpse of this law, its principles\r\nwere neither understood nor regarded in this country until the late\r\nDr. William Smith, by his own unaided exertions, proved by numerous\r\nobservations on the British strata, its value and applicability for the\r\nidentification of a deposit, in districts remote from each other.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon did not escape the notice of the distinguished French\r\nphilosophers, MM. Cuvier and Brongniart, who in their admirable work,\r\n\"_Géographie Minéralogique des Environs de Paris_,\" enunciated the same\r\nprinciple:--\r\n\r\n \"Le moyen que nous avons employé pour reconnoitre au milieu d'un si\r\n grand nombre de lits calcaires, un lit déjà, observé, dans un canton\r\n très-éloigné, est pris de la nature des fossiles renfermés dans chaque\r\n couche; ces fossiles sont toujours généralement les mêmes dans les\r\n couches correspondantes, et présentent d'un système de couche à un\r\n autre système, des différences d'espèces assez notables. C'est un\r\n signe de reconnoissance qui jusqu'à présent ne nous a pas trompés.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[9] Géog. Min. Oss. Foss. tom. ii. p. 266.\r\n\r\nNow, though recent discoveries have shown that this rule has many\r\nexceptions, and that its too stringent adoption has been productive of\r\nsome erroneous generalizations, yet if employed with due caution it\r\nis fraught with the most interesting results, and is the only certain\r\nbasis of our knowledge respecting the appearance, continuance, and\r\nextinction, of the lost races of animals and plants, which were once\r\ndenizens of our planet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROCKS AND STRATA.]\r\n\r\nIn the \"Wonders of Geology\" will be found a comprehensive sketch of\r\nthe composition and arrangement of the several formations or groups\r\nof strata; and a reference to that work will afford the student the\r\nnecessary information on this branch of Geology. For the convenience\r\nof the general reader I subjoin a synoptical view of the characters and\r\nrelations of the British fossiliferous deposits.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of the entire series of rocks within the scope\r\nof human examination, is estimated at from fifteen to twenty miles,\r\nreckoning from the summits of the highest mountains to the greatest\r\ndepths hitherto penetrated; and as this vertical section scarcely\r\namounts to 1/400th of the diameter of the globe, it is familiarly\r\ntermed the Earth's crust. The substances of which the sedimentary\r\nstrata are composed have been deposited by the action of water, and\r\nsubsequently more or less modified in structure and composition by\r\nheat, and by electro-chemical forces. The superficial accumulations of\r\nwater-worn detritus, consisting of gravel, boulders, sand, clay, &c.\r\nare termed _Drift_, or _Alluvial_ deposits. When the successive layers\r\nin which the sediments subsided are obvious, the deposits are said to\r\nbe _stratified_; when the nature of the materials has been altered by\r\nigneous action or high temperature, but the lines of stratification\r\nare not wholly effaced, the rocks are denominated _metamorphic_\r\n(_transformed_). When all traces of organic remains and of sedimentary\r\ndeposition are lost, and the mass is crystalline, and composed of\r\nknown products of igneous action, such rocks are named _plutonic_, as\r\ngranite, sienite, trap, basalt, porphyry, and the like. Lastly, rocks\r\nresembling the lavas, scoria, and other substances emitted by burning\r\nmountains still in activity, are called _volcanic_.\r\n\r\nThe sedimentary origin ascribed to ancient crystalline rocks is, of\r\ncourse, hypothetical, since all evidence of aqueous deposition is\r\nwanting, and the minerals (_mica_, _quartz_, and _felspar_) of which\r\nthey are so largely constituted, are not readily soluble in water\r\nunder ordinary circumstances. But rocks unquestionably deposited by\r\nwater, when exposed to intense heat under great pressure, acquire\r\na crystalline structure (_Wond._ p. 864); and a series of changes,\r\nfrom a loose earthy deposit, to compact volcanic lava, may be traced\r\nin numerous instances, so as to leave but little doubt that the\r\nrocks called primitive or primary, _may_ have originally been either\r\nargillaceous, siliceous, or calcareous strata, abounding in organic\r\nremains (_Wond._ p. 873). These crystalline masses have been formed\r\nat successive periods; for granite is found of all ages, occurring\r\nin the most ancient, as well as in comparatively modern epochs. The\r\ndifference between the composition and aspect of these rocks, and those\r\nof recent volcanoes, is with much probability ascribed to the fact\r\nthat the latter are of sub-aerial origin; that is, were erupted on the\r\nsurface, and the gaseous products in consequence escaped; while the\r\nformer were ejected at great depths, either beneath the sea, or under\r\nimmense accumulations of other deposits, and being thus subjected to\r\ngreat pressure, the volatile elements were confined, and formed new\r\ncombinations: in like manner as chalk when burnt in the open air is\r\nconverted into lime, the carbonic acid gas escaping; but when exposed\r\nto the same degree of heat in a closed iron tube, is transformed into\r\ngranular marble (_Wond._ p. 104).\r\n\r\nFrom these ancient crystalline rocks generally underlying the\r\nsedimentary deposits, and never appearing as if they had been ejected\r\nfrom a crater, the term _hypogene_[10] (_nether-formed_) is employed\r\nby Sir C. Lyell to designate the whole class; and they are subdivided\r\ninto, 1. _plutonic_, those in which all traces of sedimentary origin\r\nare lost, as granite; and 2. _metamorphic_, those which still manifest\r\ntraces of stratification, as mica-schist, &c.\r\n\r\n[10] Nether-formed, from ιπο, _hypo_, under; and γἱνομαι, ginomai, to be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe fossiliferous rocks are, for the convenience of study, separated\r\ninto three grand divisions.\r\n\r\n1. The Tertiary; comprising the deposits between the Chalk and the\r\nsuperficial Drift and modern Alluvium.\r\n\r\n2. The Secondary; from the _Chalk_ to the _Trias or New Red_, inclusive.\r\n\r\n3. The Palæozoic; from the _Permian_ to the _Silurian_; including the\r\nvast series of unfossiliferous slate rocks termed the _Cambrian_, in\r\nwhich all traces of organic remains are lost.\r\n\r\nIn the following arrangement the strata are enumerated as if lying\r\nin regular sequence, one beneath the other; but in nature such an\r\nunbroken series has never been observed. A few groups only occur in\r\na serial order, and these but rarely in their original position. The\r\nbeds are for the most part disrupted, and lie in various angles of\r\ninclination; sometimes they are completely retroverted, the newer\r\nstrata underlying those upon which they were originally deposited. The\r\norder of succession has been ascertained by careful observation of\r\nthe relative superposition of the respective members of the series in\r\ndifferent countries; and from an immense number of facts collected by\r\nable observers in every part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis synopsis presents a chronological arrangement of the rocks\r\naccording to the present state of geological knowledge, but it must\r\nnot be supposed that these rigid distinctions, these hard lines, which\r\nare necessary to facilitate the acquisition of a general idea of the\r\nphenomena attempted to be explained, exist in nature. By whatever\r\nnames we designate geological periods, there appear to be no clearly\r\ndefined boundaries between them in reference to the whole earth:\r\nsuch well marked lines may be seen in particular localities, but\r\ndaily experience teaches us that there is a blending, and a gradual\r\nand insensible passage, from the lowest to the highest sedimentary\r\nstrata, particularly in respect of fossil remains. The terms employed\r\nto designate formations can only be considered as expressing the\r\npredominance of certain characters, to be used provisionally, as a\r\nconvenient mode of classifying and generalizing the facts collected,\r\nwhilst that knowledge is accumulating which in after times will reveal\r\nthe nature and order of succession of the principal events in the\r\nearth's physical history.[11]\r\n\r\n[11] \"Wonders of Geology,\" p. 892.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland's \"Bridgewater Treatise\" (Vol. II. _frontispiece_)\r\ncontains a comprehensive Diagram of the rocks and strata of which the\r\ncrust of the earth is composed; it was drawn by the late Mr. Thomas\r\nWebster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF THE BRITISH STRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Hard lines are admissible in Science, whose object is not to imitate\r\n Nature, but to interpret her works.\"--Greenough.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the stratified rocks is based on three principal\r\ncharacters; namely, 1, the mineral structure; 2, the order of\r\nsuperposition; and 3, the nature of the organic remains; the following\r\nsynopsis has been drawn up in accordance with these principles.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] See \"Wonders of Geology,\" vol. i. pp. 200-207, for a Synoptical\r\nTable of the principal rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE BRITISH FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nCOMMENCING WITH THE UPPERMOST OR NEWEST DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern or Human Epoch.\r\n\r\nAlluvial Deposits: remains of Man and existing species of mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Pliocene.\r\n\r\nDrift; Boulder clay; Till; &c. comprising the superficial irregular\r\naccumulations of transported materials, consisting of gravel, boulders,\r\nsand, clay, &c.\r\n\r\n _Observations_.--These beds have been formed by a variety of causes;\r\n by land-floods and inundations, by irruptions of the sea, and by the\r\n agency of glaciers and icebergs. They are the catacombs of the extinct\r\n colossal mammalia--of the mastodon, mammoth, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,\r\n elk, horse, ox, whale, &c. They cannot be definitively separated from\r\n those of the Modern or Human epoch, for the gravel beds near Geneva,\r\n which closely resemble the newest tertiary drift in materials and\r\n position, abound in bones of animals, almost all of which belong to\r\n existing species.[13]\r\n\r\n[13] See M. Pictet's \"_Palæontologie_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTertiary Epochs.\r\n\r\nAn extensive series, comprising many isolated groups of marine\r\nand lacustrine deposits, containing fossil remains of animals and\r\nvegetables of all classes; the greater number of genera and species in\r\nthe most ancient or lowermost beds belong to extinct types.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n    1. The Pliocene[14] (_more new_, or _recent_.[15] _Wond._ p. 221);\r\n       strata in which the shells are for the most part of recent\r\n       species, having only about ten per cent of extinct forms.\r\n       (_Norwich Crag._)\r\n\r\n    2. The Miocene (_less recent_,[16] _Wond._ p. 221); containing about\r\n       20 per cent of recent species of shells. (_Suffolk Crag._)\r\n\r\n    3. The Eocene (_dawn of recent_,[17] in allusion to the first\r\n       appearance of recent species--_Wond._ p. 226); the most ancient\r\n       tertiary strata contain but very few existing species of shells;\r\n       not more than five per cent. (_London, Hants, and Paris basins._)\r\n\r\n[14] In the present state of our knowledge, this arrangement is of great\r\nutility, but it will probably require considerable modification, and\r\nmust, perhaps, hereafter be abandoned; for it cannot be doubted, that\r\nstrata in which no recent species have yet been found, may yield them\r\nto more accurate and extended observations, and those in which only a\r\nfew recent species are associated with a large number of extinct forms,\r\nmay have these proportions reversed.\r\n\r\n[15] From πλειων, _pleion_, more; and καινος, _kainos_, recent.\r\n\r\n[16] From μεἱων, _meion_, less, and recent.\r\n\r\n[17] From ἠως, _eos_, the dawn or commencement, and _recent_.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The marine are often associated with fresh-water deposits,\r\n and the general characters of the Tertiary system are alternations of\r\n marine and lacustrine strata. In England the most important Tertiary\r\n deposits are those of the London basin, the Isle of Sheppey, the\r\n south-western coasts of Sussex and Hampshire, the north of the Isle of\r\n Wight, and the eastern coasts of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk. (_Wond._ p.\r\n 226.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary Epochs.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous or Chalk Formation. (_Wond._ p. 296). A marine\r\nformation, comprising a vast series of beds of limestone, sandstone,\r\nmarl, and clay, &c.; characterized by remains of extinct zoophytes,\r\nmollusks, cephalopods, echinoderms, crustaceans, fishes, &c.;\r\nlacertians, crocodilians, chelonians, and other extinct reptiles;\r\ndrifted coniferous and dicotyledonous wood and foliage, fuci, &c.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1.

D'Orbigny; which I\r\nnotice with the more regret, since this eminent naturalist formerly\r\nrepudiated the censurable practice of many modern systematists,\r\nof changing established names of strata and fossils, without any\r\njust cause. The British geologist will smile to see the Wealden\r\nFormation--so eminently distinguished in England and Germany by its\r\nextent, thickness, and remarkable fauna and flora,--ranked as a\r\nsubordinate member of the \"_Formation néocomien_,\" of France.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The Maestricht beds are chiefly composed of fawn-coloured\r\n limestones of friable texture; containing peculiar species of corals,\r\n shells, fishes, reptiles, &c. The _Chalk_ is generally white, but\r\n in some localities is of a deep red, in others of a yellow colour;\r\n nodules, layers, and veins of flint occur in the upper, but are seldom\r\n present in the lower chalk. The _Marl_ is an argillaceous limestone,\r\n which generally prevails beneath the white chalk; it sometimes\r\n contains a large intermixture of green or chlorite sand, and then\r\n is called _Firestone_, or _Glauconite_. The _Galt_ is a stiff, blue\r\n or blackish clay, abounding in shells which frequently retain their\r\n pearly lustre. The _Greensand_ is a triple alternation of sands and\r\n sandstones with clays; and beds of cherty limestone called _Kentish\r\n Rag_.\r\n\r\nThe Wealden; a formation, whose fluviatile character was first\r\nobserved and established by the researches of the author (_Wond._\r\np. 360). A series of clays, sands, sandstones and limestones, with\r\nlayers of lignite, and extensive coal-fields; characterized by the\r\nremains of several peculiar terrestrial reptiles, namely, _Iguanodon_,\r\n_Hylæosaurus_, _Pelorosaurus_, _Megalosaurus_; _Crocodilians_ and\r\n_Chelonians_; _Enaliosaurians_; _Pterodactyles_, &c.; Fishes of\r\nfluviatile and marine genera; Insects of several orders; fresh-water\r\nmollusks and crustaceans; conifers, cycads, ferns, &c.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Weald-clay_, with Sussex or Petworth marbles.\r\n\r\n  2. _Tilgate-grit_, and _Hastings sands_.\r\n\r\n  3. _Ashburnham clays_, shales, and grey limestones.\r\n\r\n  4. _Purbeck beds_; argillaceous and calcareous shales, and\r\n       fresh-water limestones and marbles. Petrified forest, and layers\r\n       of vegetable earth; with Cycads and Conifers.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--Clays and limestones, almost wholly composed of fresh-water\r\n snail-shells, and minute crustaceans, generally occupy the uppermost\r\n place in the series in Sussex; sands and sandstones, with shales, and\r\n lignite, prevail in the middle; while in the lowermost, argillaceous\r\n beds, with shelly marbles or limestones, again appear; and, buried\r\n beneath the whole, is a petrified pine-forest, with the trees still\r\n erect, and the vegetable mould undisturbed! The upper clay beds and\r\n marbles form the deep valleys or Wealds of Kent and Sussex, and the\r\n middle series constitutes the Forest-Ridge. The Purbeck strata are\r\n obscurely seen in some of the deepest valleys of eastern Sussex;\r\n they emerge on the Dorsetshire coast, form the Island or Peninsula\r\n whose name they bear, and surmount the northern brow of the Isle of\r\n Portland. On the southern coast of the Isle of Wight, the Wealden\r\n beds emerge from beneath the Greensand strata between Atherfield and\r\n Compton Bay on the western limit, and in Sandown Bay on the eastern;\r\n and their characteristic fossils are continually being washed up on\r\n the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic or Oolitic Formation. (_Wond._ pp. 202, and 491). A\r\nmarine formation of great extent and thickness, consisting of strata\r\nof limestone and clay, which abound in extinct species and genera of\r\nmarine shells, Corals, Insects, Fishes, and terrestrial and marine\r\nReptiles. Land plants of many peculiar types, and the remains of two\r\ngenera of Mammalia.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  Upper Oolite of Portland, Wilts, Bucks, Berks, &c.\r\n\r\n  1. _Portland Oolite._ Limestone of an oolitic structure, abounding\r\n       in ammonites, trigoniæ, &c. and other marine exuviæ. Green and\r\n       ferruginous sands--layers of chert.\r\n\r\n  2. _Kimmeridge clay._ Blue clay, with septaria, and bands of sandy\r\n       concretions--marine shells and other organic remains--_ostrea\r\n       deltoidea_. Beds of lignite.\r\n\r\n  Middle Oolite of Oxford, Bucks, Yorkshire, &c.\r\n\r\n  1. _Coral oolite_, or Coral rag. Limestone composed of corals, with\r\n       shells and echinites.\r\n\r\n  2. _Oxford clay_; with septaria and numerous fossils. Beds of\r\n       calcareous grit, called _Kelloway-rock_ swarming with organic\r\n       remains.\r\n\r\n  Lower Oolite of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n  1. _Cornbrash_--a coarse shelly limestone.\r\n\r\n  2. _Forest marble_; concretions of fissile arenaceous\r\n       limestone--coarse shelly oolite--sand, grit, and blue clay.\r\n\r\n  3. _Great oolite_--calcareous oolitic limestone and freestone;\r\n       reptiles, corals, &c., upper beds full of shells.\r\n\r\n  _Stonesfield slate_;--terrestrial plants, insects, reptiles,\r\n       _Mammalia_.\r\n\r\n  4. _Fullers earth beds_;--marls and clays, with fuller's\r\n       earth--sandy limestones and shells.\r\n\r\n  5. _Inferior oolite_--coarse limestone--conglomerated masses\r\n       of terebratulæ and other shells--ferruginous sand, and\r\n       concretionary blocks of sandy limestone, and shells.\r\n\r\n  Lower Oolite, of Brora in Scotland.\r\n\r\n  1. _Shelly Limestones_--alternation of sandstones, shales, and\r\n       ironstone; land-plants.\r\n\r\n  2. _Ferruginous limestone_, with carbonized wood and shells.\r\n\r\n  3. _Sandstone and shale; with two beds of coal._\r\n\r\n  Lower Oolite of the Yorkshire coast.\r\n\r\n  1. _Cornbrash_--a provincial term for a bluish grey rubbly\r\n       limestone, with intervening layers of clay.\r\n\r\n  2. _Sandstones and clays_, with land-plants, thin beds of coal and\r\n       shale--calcareous sandstone and shelly limestone.\r\n\r\n  3. _Sandstone_--often carbonaceous, with clays; coal-beds, and\r\n       ironstone, with remains of vegetables.\r\n\r\n  4. Limestone; ferruginous and concretionary sands.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The difference observable between the lower beds of the Oolite\r\n in the midland counties, and those of Yorkshire and Scotland, is a\r\n fact of considerable interest. The fluvio-marine accumulations of\r\n vegetable matter in the state of coal, with the remains of land-plants\r\n at Scarborough and Brora, together with the presence of insects,\r\n fresh-water crustaceans, mammalia, and terrestrial plants, in the\r\n Stonesfield slate, attest the existence of neighbouring land, and the\r\n action of rivers and currents.\r\n\r\nThe Lias. (_Wond._ p. 521) A series of clays, shales, and limestones,\r\nwith marine shells, cephalopoda, crinoidea, and fishes in\r\ngreat abundance; reptiles, (particularly of two extinct genera,\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, and _Ichthyosaurus_,) in immense numbers. Drifted wood\r\nand land plants: coniferæ, cycadesæ &c.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. Upper Lias shale, full of saurian remains, belemnites,\r\n       ammonites, &c. intercalated with the lowermost beds of the\r\n       Oolite: nodules and beds of limestone.\r\n\r\n  2. Lias marlstone; calcareous, sandy, and ferruginous strata, very\r\n       rich in terebratulæ and other marine shells.\r\n\r\n  3. Lower Lias clay and shale, abounding in _gryphea incurva_, and\r\n       other marine shells; intercalations of sands and clays, with\r\n       nodules of limestone.\r\n\r\n  4. Lias rock; a series of laminated limestones, with clay partings.\r\n       Bone-bed, with numerous remains of fishes.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The Lias is the grand depository of those tribes of marine\r\n reptiles, the _Ichthyosauri_ and _Plesiosauri_, whose remarkable\r\n forms, structure, and state of preservation, have excited the\r\n attention even of the most incurious. The collection of these\r\n remains in the British Museum, principally formed by Mr. Hawkins, is\r\n unrivalled.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] See \"Petrifactions,\" p. 337-367.\r\n\r\nThe Trias; or New Red Sandstone Formation,[20] (_Wond._ p. 533).\r\nThis group of rocks consists of variegated marls, sandstones, and\r\nconglomerates, frequently of a red colour, with marine shells,\r\ncrinoideans, fishes, and reptiles; marine and terrestrial plants. This\r\nseries contains extensive deposits of rock-salt, and brine-springs.\r\n\r\n[20] Called by some geologists _Poikilitic_ (variegated) group.\r\n\r\nThis formation comprises the _Trias_, or triple group, _viz._ the\r\n_Keuper_, _Muschelkalk_, and _Upper Bunter Sandstein_, of the German\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. Variegated red, blue, and white marls, and shales, with gypsum\r\n       and beds of rock-salt. (_Marnes irisées_ of the French.)\r\n\r\n  2. Variegated red and white sandstones.\r\n\r\n  3. Conglomerates formed of the detritus of the older rocks.\r\n\r\n  4. Bed mottled sandstone, and marls. (_Grès bigarré_ of the French.)\r\n\r\n _Obs._--To this formation belong the principal deposits in\r\n Leicestershire and other midland counties of England. Fossils are\r\n not generally abundant, but some localities yield highly interesting\r\n remains. The shelly limestone of Germany, called Muschelkalk, which\r\n contains the _Lily Encrinite_, &c. does not occur in England. Remains\r\n of Conifers allied to the Yew and Araucaria, are found near Coventry;\r\n and peculiar reptiles (_Labyrinthodons_) near Warwick.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalæozoic Epochs.\r\n\r\nThe Permian Formation. (_Wond._ p. 533). The separation of the strata\r\nnow termed _Permian_ from the _Triassic_, with which they were formerly\r\nclassed, was first proposed by Sir Roderick Murchison, and is based on\r\nthe fact that the fossils hitherto discovered are entirely distinct\r\nfrom any that occur in the Trias and subsequent formations; it is,\r\ntherefore, inferred, that after the deposition of the so-called Permian\r\nstrata, a complete change took place in the faunas and floras of the\r\nlands and seas, and the Trias is _at present_ regarded as the dawn of a\r\nnew system of organic beings.\r\n\r\nThe strata comprised in this group are variegated blue and red marls\r\nand sandstones, like those of the Triassic; magnesian or dolomitic\r\nlimestones; and conglomerates more or less coloured with peroxide of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. Red and white marls.\r\n\r\n  2. Yellow magnesian limestones, and dolomitic conglomerates of\r\n       Yorkshire and Durham.\r\n\r\n  3. Marl-slate in thin layers, containing reptiles and fishes. The\r\n       Keuper schiefer or copper-schist of Mansfeld.\r\n\r\n  4. Marls and variegated sandstones, sands, and clays.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--This group includes the _Lower Bunter_, _Zechstein_, and\r\n _Rothliegendes_[21] of the German geologists. The _Permian_ comprises\r\n all the deposits that intervene between the Triassic above, and the\r\n Carboniferous below; and it is believed that this formation contains\r\n but one type of animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\n[21] Signifying _Red-dead-layer_; it is a German mining term denoting\r\nthat the copper of the upper bed has died out; this layer not being\r\nmetalliferous.\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous, or Coal Formation. (_Wond._ pp. 660-748).\r\nSandstones, grits, shales, layers of ironstone, and clay, with immense\r\nbeds of coal; fresh-water limestones sparingly; marine limestones\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. _The Coal Measures._--Sandstones, shales, and grits, with\r\n       numerous beds and seams of Coal; ironstone nodules. Land\r\n       plants in profusion. Intercalations of bands of limestone with\r\n       fresh-water bivalves and crustaceans in some districts; and with\r\n       marine shells in others.\r\n\r\n  2. _Millstone Grit._--Sandstones, shales, and quartzose\r\n       conglomerates and grit, (_provincially_, Millstone-grit): with\r\n       shales and thin seams of coal, and plants of the coal-measures\r\n       in some localities. The conglomerates and grits have evidently\r\n       resulted from the destruction of granitic rocks.\r\n\r\n  3. _Carboniferous_, or _Mountain Limestone_.--A series, nearly\r\n       1,000 feet in thickness, of limestones and flagstones, abounding\r\n       in crinoideans, corals, and marine shells and crustaceans;\r\n       with layers and nodules of chert. Ores of lead, zinc, copper,\r\n       barytes; fluor spar, &c. Limestones, with innumerable shells\r\n       of the genera Productus, Spirifer, Goniatites, Orthocera,\r\n       Bellerophon, &c. Several varieties of black, bluish grey, and\r\n       variegated marbles. Coal occurs in the mountain limestone of\r\n       some parts of Russia.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The strata comprised in the carboniferous (coal-hearing)\r\n system, consist of sandstones more or less felspathic, and of\r\n dark bituminous shales with innumerable ferns, and other vascular\r\n cryptogamiæ, and coniferæ, &c. The uppermost group is composed of\r\n numerous alternations of coal, clay, shale, ironstone, and sandstone;\r\n the middle, of sandstones, shales, clays, and quartzose conglomerates,\r\n generally of a dull red colour; and the lowermost, of crystalline\r\n limestones with occasional layers of chert, abounding in marine\r\n shells, corals, crinoidea, and other exuviæ. These lower limestones\r\n are the principal repositories of the lead ores of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian or Old Red Formation. (_Wond._ pp. 204 and 751).\r\nConglomerates, quartzose grits, sandstones, marls, and limestones;\r\nthe prevailing colour is a dull red. Shells, corals, and ganoid\r\nfishes, of a very peculiar type. Reptiles, (Telerpeton; _Batrachians?_\r\n_Chelonians?_); the most ancient reptilian remains hitherto discovered.\r\n_Ferns_, _Lepidodendrons_, and other trees of the carboniferous flora;\r\nfluviatile plants with batrachian ova(?).\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\n  1. Sandstone, quartzose conglomerates, and shale, with but few\r\n       fossils.\r\n\r\n  2. Flagstones, marls, and concretionary limestones; provincially\r\n       termed _corn-stones_; laminated reddish and greenish micaceous\r\n       sandstones (_prov. tilestones_). Peculiar genera of fish;\r\n       orthocerata, and many species of marine shells.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The term Devonian, by which the series of strata comprehended\r\n in this formation is now generally distinguished by geologists, was\r\n first proposed by Sir R. Murchison, as being more precise than the\r\n name formerly applied to this group. In Scotland, where the formation\r\n is of vast extent, it was first characterized by its peculiar ganoid\r\n fishes (Pterichthys, Coccosteus, Cephalaspis), and will probably\r\n always there retain the original name of Old Red.[22] In Devonshire\r\n it is marked by the presence of shells of a character intermediate\r\n between those of the Silurian and Carboniferous systems.\r\n\r\n The sandstones are in various states of induration, and when slaty,\r\n are employed for roofing. The red colour predominates in the marls,\r\n and is derived from peroxide of iron. The formation of these rocks\r\n has manifestly resulted from the waste of ancient slate rocks, the\r\n detritus of which is cemented together into coarse conglomerates. In\r\n South Devonshire (at Torquay, Babbicombe, &c.), beautiful coralline\r\n marbles occur in this formation.\r\n\r\n[22] See the charming volume of Mr. Hugh Miller, entitled \"The Old Red\r\nSandstone, or New Walks in an Old Field.\"\r\n\r\nThe Silurian System. (_Wond._ p. 765). Marine limestones, sandstones,\r\nshales, and calcareous flagstones, characterized by peculiar types\r\nof corals, crinoideans, mollusks, and crustaceans, constitute this\r\nimportant and extensive system of rocks; the _Grauwacké_, or Transition\r\nseries of the earlier geologists.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions_:--\r\n\r\nUPPER SILURIAN.\r\n\r\n  1. _Ludlow rocks_;--slightly micaceous grey-coloured sandstones.\r\n       Blue and grey argillaceous limestones. Dark-coloured shales and\r\n       flagstones, with concretions of earthy limestone, containing\r\n       marine shells, Orthocerata, Spirifers, and Trilobites. _Fishes._\r\n\r\n  2. _Wenlock_, or _Dudley limestone_;--sub-crystalline blue and grey\r\n       limestone, abounding in Trilobites, Crinoidea, Polyparia,\r\n       Spirifers, Orthocerata, &c.\r\n\r\n  3. _Wenlock shale_;--dark grey argillaceous shale, with nodules of\r\n       sandstone.\r\n\r\nLOWER SILURIAN.\r\n\r\n  1. _Caradoc sandstone_;--shelly limestones, and finely laminated,\r\n       slightly micaceous, greenish sandstones. Corals, Shells,\r\n       Trilobites.\r\n\r\n  2. _Llandeilo flags and limestones._ Freestone, conglomerates,\r\n       grits, and limestones. Dark-coloured flags. Beds of schist with\r\n       abundance of Trilobites and shells. The lowermost beds are full\r\n       of small bivalves, termed _Lingulæ._\r\n\r\n _Obs._--The _Silurian System_, (so named by Sir R. Murchison, from\r\n the _Silures_, the ancient Britons who inhabited those parts of our\r\n island in which the geological relations of these strata were first\r\n recognised by him,) occupies the border counties of England and\r\n Wales, and spreads over a vast area of both North and South Wales,\r\n intervening between the Carboniferous series and the Cambrian or\r\n ancient slate-rocks of that country.[23] The strata are entirely of\r\n marine origin, and many of the beds (as the well-known Dudley or\r\n Wenlock limestone) are composed of shells, corals, crinoideans, and\r\n remains of that remarkable family of crustaceans termed Trilobites,\r\n cemented together by carbonate of lime. A few remains of Fishes occur:\r\n Reptiles are unknown. No vegetable relics, excepting _Fuci_, have been\r\n found in Britain below the _Devonian_ or _Old Red formation_.[24]\r\n\r\n[23] \"The Silurian System, founded on Geological Researches in the\r\nBorder Counties of England and Wales.\" In two parts, royal 4to., with\r\nmap, sections, &c., by Sir R.

Murchison abrogated\r\nthe boundary line that separates the Cambrian and Silurian rocks\r\nin this chart, from the conviction that those deposits constitute\r\nbut one natural system (see _Wond._ p. 80.3). For an account of the\r\nSilurian rocks of other countries, see \"Geology of Russia,\" by the same\r\nAuthor. A summary of the characters of the Silurian System, by Sir R.\r\nMurchison, is given in _Geolog.

This term is applied to a largely developed\r\nseries of unfossiliferous slate-rocks and conglomerates, many thousand\r\nyards in thickness.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--Certain beds of dark-coloured schists containing a few\r\n corals, fuci, and shells, are referred to the uppermost part of this\r\n formation by some eminent geologists, but it is more consonant to the\r\n established system of classification to regard these fossiliferous\r\n beds as the lowermost of the Silurian rocks. The fineness of grain,\r\n general aspect, hardness, and texture of these strata, are well\r\n known, from the general employment of slate for economical purposes.\r\n These rocks extend over a great part of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and\r\n Lancashire, reaching to elevations of 3,000 feet, and giving rise to\r\n the grand scenery of the Lakes, and of North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypogene Rocks.

Granite--a rock composed of mica,\r\nquartz, and felspar; Porphyry; Serpentine; Trap. These rocks occur in\r\namorphous or shapeless masses, and in dykes and veins.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--No fossils have been detected in these rocks: but the intense\r\n igneous action which the masses appear to have undergone, may have\r\n obliterated all evidence of animal and vegetable structures, should\r\n any have been present, as well as the lines of stratification. By\r\n the aid of the microscope, we may yet perhaps solve the mystery\r\n which shrouds the origin of these rocks, and the student may take\r\n up the investigation with the certainty of obtaining much valuable\r\n information, even should the search for organic structures prove\r\n abortive. It is not, however, improbable that the siliceous frustules\r\n of diatomaceæ may have escaped destruction, and remain to reward the\r\n researches of some skillful and patient observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolcanic Rocks. (_Wond._ p. 815.)\r\n\r\nThe products of subterranean fire or heat, erupted from profound depths\r\nthrough fissures in the Earth's crust, whether in ancient or modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n_Subdivisions._--\r\n\r\n  1. _Trap, Basalt, Toadstone, Volcanic-tuff_; the erupted materials\r\n       of ancient extinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\n  2. _Lavas, Scoriæ, Pumice, Ashes_; ejected by modern volcanoes.\r\n\r\n _Obs._--These igneous products are of all ages, and they traverse\r\n alike the hypogene rocks and the older and newer sedimentary deposits.\r\n Their characters, and the effects they have produced, are considered\r\n in the work to which reference is made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy a reference to the geological map of England (_Wond._ pl. i.\r\nvol. i.), it will be seen, that the several formations appear on\r\nthe surface in a somewhat chronological order, as we pass from the\r\neastern or south-eastern part of the Island to the west or north-west.\r\nThus the principal Tertiary deposits are situated in the eastern\r\nand south-eastern parts; and proceeding towards the north-west, we\r\ntraverse successively the _Secondary_--the _Chalk_, _Oolite_, _Lias_\r\nand _Trias_; then the _Palæozoic_--_Permian_, _Carboniferous_,\r\nand _Devonian_; next the _Silurian_ and _Cambrian_; and at length\r\n_metamorphic_ and _primary_ rocks appear. It is this distribution\r\nof the strata of the respective formations that has determined\r\nthe characters of the physical geography of England. The Alpine or\r\nmountainous districts, which extend north and south along the western\r\nportion of England and Wales, from Cornwall to Cumberland, are formed\r\nby the elevated masses of the Silurian, Cambrian, and Metamorphic\r\nrocks. These are succeeded by a band of the Carboniferous and Triassic\r\ndeposits, with a few intrusions of metamorphic and plutonic rocks, that\r\nstretches from the coast of Devonshire, through the midland counties,\r\nby Leicestershire and Derbyshire, to Newcastle. On the south-east\r\nof this tract, the Oolite and Cretaceous formations, chiefly made\r\nup of argillaceous and calcareous strata, constitute a diversified\r\nagricultural district, extending from the southern shores of Hants and\r\nDorset to the coast of Yorkshire. The Wealden occupies the country\r\nlying between the Chalk Downs of Sussex, Hants, Surrey, and Kent. The\r\nTertiary deposits lie in basins or depressions of the upper cretaceous\r\nrocks in the south-eastern and eastern maritime districts, and on an\r\nextensive area of these beds stands the metropolis of England; lastly,\r\nirregular accumulations of Drift, containing mammalian remains in some\r\nlocalities, are spread over the surface of the ancient formations, and\r\nform the immediate subsoil of the most fertile regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nON THE NATURE OF FOSSILS, OR ORGANIC REMAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossils; Petrifactions.--It is very generally the case, that persons\r\nwho are not conversant with the nature of organic remains, suppose\r\nthat all fossils are petrifactions; and unless a specimen has the\r\naspect and hardness of stone, they regard it as of modern origin, and\r\ndevoid of interest. Hence they are surprised to find among the choicest\r\ntreasures in the cabinet of the geologist, shells and corals as perfect\r\nin form, as if recently collected from the sea-shore; bones as little\r\nchanged, as if they had been interred but for a short period; and\r\nteeth possessing their sharp edges and enamel unimpaired. In my early\r\nresearches I fell into this error, and threw away many beautiful shells\r\nthat were associated with casts of ammonites in the marl at Hamsey,\r\nsupposing, from their perfect state, that they had been accidentally\r\nimbedded, and were not genuine fossils. But the state of preservation,\r\nand the degree of change which an organic body has undergone in the\r\nmineral kingdom, have no necessary relation to its antiquity. The\r\nshells in some of the ancient secondary strata are frequently as little\r\nchanged as those in modern tertiary deposits. I have collected from the\r\nlowermost clays of the Wealden, fresh-water shells with traces of the\r\nepidermis, and the ligament by which the valves were held together,\r\nperfect; and bones of reptiles from the strata of Tilgate Forest, as\r\nlight and porous as those of the bears and hyenas, from the Caverns of\r\nGermany. On the other hand, fossil remains from the newest tertiary\r\nformations are often completely petrified, that is, permeated by, or\r\ntransmuted into, stone.\r\n\r\nThe words _fossil_ and _petrifaction_ are so commonly used as\r\nsynonymous terms, even by educated persons, that it is necessary to\r\ndefine the sense in which they are employed in these volumes.\r\n\r\n_Fossils_ are the durable parts of animal and vegetable structures\r\nimbedded in rocks and strata by natural causes at a remote period; thus\r\nwood in a state of lignite, bog-wood, and coal, or of siliceous or\r\ncalcareous stone, is _fossil wood_; and bones or shells, whether in an\r\nearthy and decaying state, or permeated by calc-spar, flint, or iron,\r\nand converted into a hard mineral substance, are alike _fossil bones_\r\nor _shells_.\r\n\r\n_Petrifactions_ are the remains of animals and vegetables in which\r\nthe original structure is converted into stone, or, in other words,\r\nis _petrified_; such are the silicified stems of trees from Antigua,\r\nand Germany, and the calcified bones and shells in the Oolitic and\r\nWealden limestones. Such petrifactions may be correctly termed fossil\r\nplants, bones, or shells; but similar organic remains, though of equal\r\nantiquity, which have not undergone such changes, are not petrifactions\r\nin the proper meaning of that term.\r\n\r\nThe process by which petrifaction is effected is still involved in\r\nobscurity; mineral solutions have permeated the original tissues,\r\nand the organic molecules have been replaced by mineral molecules,\r\nbut how this transmutation is produced is not understood. Mr. Dana's\r\nobservations and Mr. Jeffery's experiments have, however, thrown much\r\nlight on the process of silicification.[25]\r\n\r\n[25] See _Wond._ p. 100.\r\n\r\n_Incrustations._--Another prevalent error is that of considering\r\nIncrustations to be fossils or petrifactions; a mistake which is\r\nsanctioned by the custom of calling waters that are charged with\r\ncalcareous earth (_lime_), and deposit it in considerable quantity,\r\npetrifying springs; as those of Matlock, and other places in\r\nDerbyshire. (_Wond._ p. 76.) But incrustations are not petrifactions;\r\nstems and branches of trees, skulls, bones, shells, &c., are simply\r\ninvested with a calcareous coating or crust, which is generally porous\r\nand friable, but often crystalline and compact. The inclosed bodies\r\nare not permeated by the stony matter; if the mass be broken, or\r\nthe incrustation removed, we find the twig, or stem, either dry and\r\nshrivelled, as in the specimens, figs. 2, 3, 4, Plate III.; or tubular\r\ncavities are left by the decay and removal of the vegetable structure,\r\nas in fig. 10, Plate III.\r\n\r\nBut although incrustations be not petrifactions, natural specimens,\r\n(not the so-called petrified nests and twigs, in which the bad taste of\r\nthe guardians of the Derbyshire springs is embodied, and dispersed all\r\nover England,) are objects of considerable interest, as illustrative\r\nof a process, by which important changes are effected in the mineral\r\nkingdom. Thus springs as clear and sparkling as poet ever feigned or\r\nsung, may transform beds of loose sand and gravel into rock, and porous\r\nstone into solid marble, and cover extensive tracts of country with\r\nlayers of concretionary and crystalline limestone. This process is\r\neffected in the following manner. Most fresh water holds in solution a\r\ncertain proportion of carbonate of lime; and changes of temperature, as\r\nwell as other causes, will occasion this calcareous earth to be in part\r\nor wholly precipitated. The _fur_, as it is called, that lines a kettle\r\nor boiler which has been long in use, affords a familiar illustration\r\nof this fact. At the temperature of 60° lime is soluble in 700 times\r\nits weight of water; and if to the solution a small portion of carbonic\r\nacid be added, a carbonate of lime is formed, which is thrown down\r\nin an insoluble state. But if the carbonic acid be in such quantity\r\nas to supersaturate the lime, it is again rendered soluble in water:\r\nit is thus that carbonate of lime, held in solution by an excess of\r\ncarbonic acid, not in actual combination with the lime, but contained\r\nin the water, and acting as a menstruum, is commonly found in all\r\nwaters. An absorption of carbonic acid, or a loss of that portion which\r\nexists in excess, will therefore occasion the lime to be set free, and\r\nprecipitated on the foreign bodies in the water, as stones, twigs,\r\nleaves, &c.\r\n\r\nThe substance thus deposited is termed _tufa_, or travertine;[26] and\r\nin some parts of Italy, and of our own Island, it constitutes beds of\r\nstone of great extent, in which bones, shells, and the impressions of\r\nleaves and stems, are preserved. The stalactites and stalagmites of\r\ncaverns have a similar origin; many of these caves are of incalculable\r\nantiquity, and beneath their stalagmitic floors, the bones and teeth of\r\nextinct carnivorous animals are found in vast quantities.\r\n\r\n[26] _Travertine_, so called from the river _Tibur_, whose waters are\r\nloaded with calcareous earth--_Tiburtina_, Ital. _travertina_.\r\n\r\nSilicification, or petrifaction by Silex or Flint.--Silex, or the earth\r\nof flint, is held in solution in large proportions, in certain thermal\r\nor boiling springs, which, on cooling, deposit the siliceous matter\r\n(in the same manner as the travertine is precipitated from incrusting\r\nstreams) on foreign substances, and produce exquisite chalcedonic\r\ninfiltrations of mosses, &c. But this operation is now only known to\r\nbe in activity in the immediate neighbourhood of foci of volcanic\r\naction, as in the celebrated Geysers of Iceland (_Wond._ p. 95), and\r\nthe boiling springs of the volcano of Tongariro, in New Zealand (98).\r\nWe have everywhere evidence that in former periods, the petrifaction,\r\nas well as the incrustation of organic bodies by silex, was carried on\r\nto an immense extent; and, doubtless, far beneath the surface, the same\r\noperation is at the present moment in constant progress, and effecting\r\nas important changes in the consolidation of loose materials, as in the\r\nearlier geological epochs.\r\n\r\nThe various states in which silex occurs have depended on its fluidity;\r\nin quartz crystals the solution appears to have been complete; in agate\r\nand chalcedony it was in a gelatinous state, assuming a spheroidal or\r\norbicular disposition, according to the motion given to its particles.\r\nIts condition appears also to have been modified by the influence\r\nof organic matter. In some polished slices of siliceous nodules the\r\ntransition from flint to agate, chalcedony, and crystallized quartz, is\r\nbeautifully shown. The curious fact, that the cavities of echinites in\r\nchalk are almost invariably filled with flint, while their crustaceous\r\ncases are changed into calc-spar, is probably, in many instances, to\r\nbe attributed to the animal matter having undergone silicification;\r\nfor the soft gelatinous parts are those which appear to have been most\r\nsusceptible of this transmutation. In some specimens, the oyster is\r\nchanged into flint, while the shell is converted into crystallized\r\ncarbonate of lime. In a Trigonia from Tisbury, formerly in the cabinet\r\nof the late Miss Benett, of Norton House, near Warminster, the body\r\nof the mollusk was completely metamorphosed into a pure chalcedony,\r\nthe branchiæ or gills being as clearly defined as when the animal was\r\nrecent. In specimens of wood from Australia (presented to the British\r\nMuseum by Sir Thomas Mitchell), which are thoroughly permeated by\r\nsilex, there are on the external surface some spots of chalcedony that\r\nhave apparently originated from the exudation of the liquid silex from\r\nthe interior in viscid globules filled with air, which burst, and then\r\ncollapsed, and became solidified in their present form.\r\n\r\nIn silicified wood the permeation of the vegetable tissues by the\r\nmineral matter, appears to have been effected by solutions of silex of\r\na high temperature. In some examples the mineralization is simply a\r\nreplacement: the original substance has been removed atom by atom, and\r\nthe silex substituted in its place.\r\n\r\nOne of the most eminent naturalists and chemists of the United States,\r\nMr. Dana,[27] suggests that the reason why silica is so common a\r\nmaterial in the constitution of fossil wood and shells, as well as in\r\npseudo-morphic crystals,[28] is the ready solution of silex in water\r\nat a high temperature (a fact affirmed by Bergman[29]) under great\r\npressure, whenever an alkali is present, as is seen at the present\r\ntime in many volcanic regions, and its deposition again when the water\r\ncools. A mere heated aqueous solution of silica, under high pressure,\r\nis sufficient to explain the phenomenon of the silicification of\r\norganic structures. Mr. Dana states that a crystal of calc-spar in\r\nsuch a fluid being exposed to solution, from the action of the heated\r\nwater alone, the silica deposits itself gradually on a reduction\r\nof temperature, and takes the place of the lime, atom by atom, as\r\nsoon as set free. Every silicified fossil is an example of this\r\npseudo-morphism; but there seems to be no union of the silica with the\r\nlime, for silicate of lime is of rare occurrence.[30]\r\n\r\n[27] American Journal of Science for January 1845.\r\n\r\n[28] Pseudo-morphic crystals are crystals moulded in the cavities\r\nleft by other crystals which they have replaced. See Dr. Blum on\r\nPseudo-morphous minerals.\r\n\r\n[29] Bergman first determined the solubility of silex in simple water,\r\naided by heat, and demonstrated its existence in the Geysers and other\r\nboiling springs of Iceland.--_Parkinson, Org. Rem._ vol. i. p. 324.\r\n\r\n[30] See my \"Notes on a Microscopical Examination of Chalk and Flint,\"\r\nAnnals of Natural History, August 1845.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI proceed to consider the various states in which the remains of\r\nanimals and plants are preserved in the mineral kingdom, and shall\r\noccasionally offer suggestions for collecting and preparing specimens;\r\nbut particular instructions on this head will be given in the sequel,\r\nwhen the different kinds of fossils are respectively considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ANIMAL REMAINS.]\r\n\r\nAnimal Remains.--Of the higher orders of animals, the more durable\r\nportions of the skeleton, as the bones and teeth, are almost the\r\nonly parts that occur in a fossil state; except in some remarkable\r\ninstances, in which entire carcasses of extinct species of Elephant,\r\nand of Rhinoceros, have been found imbedded in solid ice, and frozen\r\ngravel. (_Wond._ p. 152.) The countries of arctic regions are now the\r\nonly localities in which such phenomena are likely to be met with;\r\nit appears, however, that in some remote period, the bodies of large\r\nmammalia were transported by icebergs into temperate regions, where\r\nthe ice melted, and the animals either sunk to the bottom of the sea,\r\nor were drifted into estuaries, or stranded on the shore: the soft\r\nparts then decomposed, and the skeletons and detached bones were left\r\nimbedded in the silt, sand, or shingle.\r\n\r\nIn this manner alone can be explained the occurrence of bones and teeth\r\nof the mammoth, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, &c. so common in the alluvial\r\nor drifted deposits of this country; for these relics, though extremely\r\nfriable, and buried in shingle, boulders, and other transported\r\nmaterials, are not water-worn, but in numerous instances remain as\r\nsharp and perfect as when recent. In the ancient shingle of Brighton\r\ncliffs (_Wond._ p. 114), I have found bones and teeth of horse, deer,\r\nox, whale, &c. impacted with quartz and granite pebbles and boulders;\r\nthe bones, though crumbling to pieces if not very carefully removed,\r\nbeing entire, and the whole mass held together by calcareous spar,\r\ndeposited by water that had, during the lapse of ages, percolated\r\nthrough the chalk-rubble above.\r\n\r\nFossil bones are found in four different states: 1. With their animal\r\nmatter, as in the bones of the Mastodons from Big-bone Lick, Kentucky.\r\n2. With the animal matter removed. 3. With the earthy matter partly\r\nremoved, 4. With the animal matter carbonized, or converted into\r\nbitumen; this change is common in the blue Lias clay; the bones retain\r\ntheir usual quantity of phosphate of lime, but the animal matter is\r\nconverted into carbon. This alteration appears to have taken place\r\nunconnected with a high temperature, and to have been a spontaneous\r\nchange in a moist situation, to which air had no access.[31]\r\n\r\n[31] Mr. Smee, London Med. Gazette, November 1840.\r\n\r\nAnother, and very remarkable condition, is that in which the phosphate\r\nof lime has been removed by the infiltration of water charged with\r\nsulphuric or carbonic acid, and the gelatin converted into leather\r\nby tannin; as is the case with bones and teeth of deer, horses, &c.\r\nobtained from a submerged forest of oak, larch, &c. near Ferry-bridge,\r\nin Yorkshire; of which there are many instructive specimens in the York\r\nMuseum.[32]\r\n\r\n[32] Communicated by Professor John Phillips.\r\n\r\nThe cancellated structure (that is, the little cells or pores) of\r\nthe long-bones of mammalia, found in caverns in England and Germany,\r\nand in the breccia of Gibraltar, and the conglomerates of Ava and\r\nthe Sub-Himalaya mountains, &c., are often filled with crystallized\r\ncarbonate of lime. In the Wealden deposits the osseous carapaces and\r\nplastrons of Turtles, and the bones and teeth of Crocodiles, Lizards,\r\n&c., are almost without exception heavy, and of various shades of brown\r\nor umber, from the infiltration of solutions of carbonates and oxides\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, bones of a jet black are imbedded in the white\r\ncalciferous grit; the phosphoric acid in the original organism having\r\ncombined with iron and produced a deep blue or black phosphate of that\r\nmineral, and left the surrounding stone uncoloured.\r\n\r\nPetrifaction by the infiltration of calcareous solutions is equally\r\ncommon; and the medullary cavities of the bones are frequently lined\r\nor filled with white calc-spar; brilliant pyrites also enters into the\r\ncomposition of these fossils, frosting over with a golden metallic\r\ndeposit the cavities and fissures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BONES.]\r\n\r\nThe permeation of the teeth by mineral matter, produces beautiful\r\nexamples of the tissues of those organs; the dentine is often stained\r\nthroughout with a rich sienna tint, and sections viewed under the\r\nmicroscope by transmitted light, reveal the character and distribution\r\nof the calcigerous tubes more clearly even than in recent specimens.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely rare that osseous structures are found petrified by\r\nflint; among the many thousands of bones which I have extracted from\r\nthe rocks, or have seen in collections, I know but of one instance of\r\na silicified vertebra, that of a Mosasaurus, from a chalk-pit near\r\nBrighton; and a few bones and scales of fishes. But notwithstanding the\r\nweight and apparent solidity imparted by these modes of mineralization,\r\nthe substance is generally rendered extremely brittle, so that the\r\ndevelopment of the bones from the stone in which they are imbedded,\r\nand the removal of the hard ferrugino-calcareous crust investing them,\r\nis no easy task, but requires much tact, experience, and patience, to\r\nexecute successfully.\r\n\r\nHints for collecting fossil bones.--The light, friable, porous bones,\r\nrequire great care in their removal from the deposit in which they\r\nare imbedded, whether it be clay, consolidated shingle, or limestone;\r\nif of considerable size, they will almost invariably break to pieces,\r\nand many examples will not admit of repair. It is therefore always\r\ndesirable, before attempting to extract a large bone, to make a sketch\r\nof it; its form will thus be known, should it be destroyed; and if it\r\ncrack into fragments that will admit of reunion, the drawing will be a\r\nvaluable guide for the replacement of the separated parts. If only a\r\nfew pieces remain, those which show any portion of the terminations,\r\nor joints, should be preserved, as they afford the most precise and\r\nimportant characters. The faithful record even of an imperfect and\r\nunknown fossil is not without value; and as the antiquary carefully\r\npreserves shreds of ancient manuscripts, in the hope that other\r\ndocuments may one day come to light, and enable him to interpret these\r\nnow unintelligible records; so the geologist should treasure up every\r\nfragment of an undetermined organic remain, for the time may arrive, as\r\nI have often experienced, when specimens will be discovered that may\r\nillustrate its nature, and prove it to be of considerable interest.\r\n\r\nThe broken porous bones may be easily repaired by a hot weak solution\r\nof glue; and when the joinings are set, the bone should be saturated\r\nwith thin glue, well brushed in, and the surface be sponged clean with\r\nvery hot water before the cement is congealed. When dry, the specimens\r\nwill be found to possess considerable firmness and durability.[33]\r\nBy this process the tusks of mammoths and elephants may be restored,\r\nhowever much crushed; time, patience, and a little dexterity, only are\r\nrequired, to convert a heap of mere fragments into a valuable relic of\r\nthe ancient world.\r\n\r\n[33] A liquid, called \"Neuber's liquid glue,\" is an excellent cement\r\nfor this purpose: it is sold at No. 54, New Oxford Street, London.\r\n\r\nWhen the bones are tolerably perfect, but dry and friable from the\r\nloss of their animal oil, they may be made durable by saturating\r\nthem with drying oil, and exposing them to a considerable degree of\r\nheat; in this manner the magnificent skeletons of the sloth tribe,\r\nthe Megatherium, and Mylodon, in the Hunterian Museum, were prepared.\r\nWhen a bone appears as if cracked into numerous pieces before its\r\nremoval, but still preserves its form, the only method by which it can\r\nbe successfully extracted, is by spreading over it a thick layer of\r\nplaster of Paris, which should be used of the consistence of cream;\r\nwhen it sets, (which, if the plaster be recently prepared, will be in\r\nthe course of a few minutes,) the specimen may be carefully extricated,\r\nand the plaster removed or not, according to the nature of the fossil,\r\nand the parts to be displayed. The bones of the large reptiles which\r\noccur in the Wealden and Oolite, may be restored in the same manner.\r\nThese remains are generally very brittle, and when imbedded in hard\r\ngrit cannot be extracted whole: they will often fall to pieces on the\r\nslightest blow of the hammer or chisel. When of moderate size, it is\r\nbest not to attempt their removal from the stone, but to trim the block\r\ninto a convenient shape, and carefully chisel away the surrounding\r\npart, so as to expose the essential characters of the bone. In all\r\ncases this is an excellent method where practicable, for such specimens\r\nhave a double interest; they are at once illustrative examples of the\r\nfossil, and of the rock in which it was deposited.\r\n\r\nBut many specimens will not admit of this method; and with large\r\nones it is inconvenient and undesirable, except where bones lie in\r\njuxtaposition. The large examples in Tilgate grit, (figured in the\r\nFossils of Tilgate Forest,) were all extracted piecemeal from the rock:\r\nand most of the gigantic bones of the Iguanodon, &c. now in the British\r\nMuseum, were originally in many hundred pieces, and were cemented\r\ntogether with glue in the manner above described; I have found no other\r\nmethod so convenient and effective.\r\n\r\nWhen a bone is too imperfect to be united as a whole, it may be\r\nimbedded in Roman cement, or plaster of Paris, which when dry may be\r\ncoloured of the prevailing tint of the rock. For large heavy specimens,\r\nthe cement is preferable; it is of easy application, and the fissures\r\nand cracks of the bones may be filled up with it, taking care first to\r\ncover the parts with thin hot glue, or the cement, when it dries, will\r\nshrink and fall out. A thin coating of mastic varnish will restore the\r\ncolour, and by excluding the air, tend to preserve the specimens.\r\n\r\nThe teeth have generally undergone the same changes as the bones with\r\nwhich they are associated. The teeth of elephants or mammoths that are\r\nimbedded in loose calcareous earth, like the loam and chalk-rubble of\r\nBrighton cliffs, and of Walton in Essex, are friable, and apt to split\r\nand separate in the direction of the vertical plates of dentine and\r\nbone: the pieces should be glued together, and when set, the tooth be\r\nthoroughly saturated with thin glue, used very hot, and the superfluous\r\ncement removed with a sponge wrung out as dry as possible from boiling\r\nwater. If there be any portion of the jaw attached to the teeth, it\r\nmust be carefully preserved; and search should be made for fragments of\r\nthe articulations, or parts of the joints and sockets.\r\n\r\nIn argillaceous strata, as the Lias-shale, London Clay, &c., the\r\nfossils are frequently saturated with brilliant pyrites, or sulphuret\r\nof iron; a mineral which decomposes upon exposure to the atmosphere,\r\nand occasions the destruction of the specimens. The fossils of the Isle\r\nof Sheppey are peculiarly obnoxious to this change.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ANIMAL REMAINS.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of vertebrated animals in the Lias, very often occur\r\nas skeletons more or less perfect, the entire configuration of\r\nthe original being preserved in many instances (_Bd._ pl. 7.\r\n_Petrifactions_, p. 340). But the deposit in which they lie is\r\ngenerally laminated, and the shale flakes off without great care; much\r\ntime, labour, and practice are therefore required, to obtain specimens\r\nof any considerable size. To the late Miss Mary Anning, of Lyme Regis,\r\nthe merit is due, of having first accomplished this difficult task;\r\nMr. Hawkins has subsequently carried the art to perfection, as may be\r\nseen in the marvellous examples of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri, in the\r\nBritish Museum.[34]\r\n\r\n[34] Petrifactions, Room IV. chap. iv. pp. 341, 376.\r\n\r\nThe small specimens, such as the detached paddles, groups of vertebræ\r\nand ribs, &c., that are likely to come under the collector's notice\r\nin his personal researches, are not difficult of preservation. Mr.\r\nHawkins employed a strong watery solution of gum arabic as the cement,\r\nand plaster of Paris as the ground, using shallow wooden trays of\r\nwell-seasoned wood, in which the specimens were permanently imbedded:\r\nthe bones, scales, &c. were then varnished with a solution of mastic,\r\nand the ground coloured bluish grey, to imitate the Lias. I have had\r\nconsiderable practice in the dissection of skeletons imbedded in Lias,\r\nand having found the method previously described answer every purpose,\r\nhave not employed that recommended by Mr. Hawkins.\r\n\r\nThe scales of reptiles and fishes, either in connected masses or\r\ndetached, are frequently met with in great perfection, and sometimes\r\nassociated with the teeth and bones. In the Lias, even the remains\r\nof the skin and integuments (_Bd._ pl. 10) have been discovered.\r\nWhenever any part of a skeleton is found lying in shale or stone,\r\nthe surrounding block should therefore be carefully examined, to\r\nascertain if there be traces of the skin or integuments, before any\r\npart is removed by the chisel. The specimen of an Ichthyosaurian\r\npaddle, figured in the second volume of this work, affords a good\r\nillustration of the propriety of this caution. Around the bones are\r\nseen the carbonized remains of the cartilaginous fringe that supported\r\nthe integuments, and thus the perfect form of the paddle has been\r\nascertained; had the surrounding stone been chiselled away, the most\r\nimportant characters would have been obliterated, as probably they have\r\nbeen in numerous instances.\r\n\r\nNodular masses of indurated clay containing fishes, are often broken\r\nwith difficulty in such a manner as will expose the enclosed fossil,\r\nfor the nodule generally splits in various directions, and the specimen\r\nis irreparably mutilated or defaced. My friend Sir Woodbine Parish\r\ninforms me that by subjecting such nodules to a high temperature--but\r\nnot to a red heat--and then plunging them in cold water, they may when\r\ndry, by a properly directed blow of a hammer, be readily fractured in a\r\ndirection parallel with the plane of the imbedded fossil, and the fish\r\nbe laid bare in the most favourable position.\r\n\r\nThe scales of fishes, and the integuments of marine reptiles, are not\r\nthe only vestiges of the dermal coverings of vertebrated animals that\r\nare preserved by mineralization. Traces of the wing-integument of\r\nflying reptiles, and of the feathers of birds, are sometimes manifest:\r\nand even when every atom of the original structure has perished, the\r\nimpression may remain, and afford satisfactory results. The footmarks\r\nof unknown animals are often preserved in the rocks, and the imprints\r\nof the feet of several species of bipeds, presumed to be birds of\r\ncolossal size, in tracks as distinct as if but recently made, have been\r\ndiscovered in the New Red sandstone of North America; in the section on\r\nfossil birds, this highly interesting subject will be fully explained.\r\n\r\nThe student, even from this brief review, will perceive how many\r\nvaluable facts may be unnoticed, and irretrievably lost, unless\r\nattention be paid to the various circumstances under which fossil\r\nremains are presented to his notice.\r\n\r\nOf the invertebrated orders, the most durable, and consequently the\r\nmost numerous relics, are shells and corals. The integuments of the\r\neyes, antennæ, and wings of Insects occur; and the shelly coverings\r\nof Crustaceans are not uncommon; those of the Echinoderms, the\r\nStar-fishes, and of the Crinoidea or Lily-animals, are very abundant in\r\ncertain deposits. Instructions for the collection and arrangement of\r\nthese fossils will be given in the chapters in which they are severally\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART II.\r\n\r\n                              ⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼◆⎼⎼⎼⎼⎼\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                            FOSSIL BOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Vegetables.--The remains of the vegetable kingdom are presented\r\nto the notice of the geologist in various conditions; in some instances\r\nthese relics are but little changed in their aspect, as, for example,\r\nin the recent accumulations of mud and silt, at the bottoms of lakes\r\nand rivers, and in morasses, and peat-bogs. In tufaceous incrustations,\r\nthe imprints of wood, and of leaves and stems, are often sharply\r\ndefined on the solid masses of concretionary and crystalline limestone.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient deposits, vegetables are found in two different states.\r\nIn the one their substance is completely permeated by mineral matter;\r\nit may be calcareous (_lime_), siliceous (_flint_), ferruginous\r\n(_iron_), or pyritous (_sulphuret of iron_); and yet both the external\r\ncharacters, and the internal structure, may be preserved. Such are the\r\nfossil trees of the Isle of Portland, fragments of which so closely\r\nresemble decayed wood, as to deceive the casual observer, until by\r\nclose examination of their texture and substance he finds that they\r\npossess the weight and hardness of stone. In the silicified wood which\r\nabounds in many of the tertiary strata, the most delicate tissues of\r\nthe original are preserved, and by microscopical examination (see Pl.\r\nV.) may be displayed in a distinct and beautiful manner. In calcareous\r\nfossil wood the structure is also retained; and in many limestones,\r\nleaves and seed-vessels are well preserved.\r\n\r\nThe ligneous coverings, or the husks and shells, of nuciferous fruits,\r\nand the cones or strobili of Firs and Pines, are frequently met with in\r\nan excellent state of preservation; in some rare instances indications\r\nof flowers have been observed (_Lign. 67_). The parts of fructification\r\nin some of the fern tribe (_Lign._ 25 and 27), occur in coal-shale,\r\nand in the grit of Tilgate Forest (_Wond._ p. 394): the pollen, and the\r\nresinous secretions of pines and firs, have been discovered in tertiary\r\nmarls, and in the Greensand. The well-known substance. Amber, so much\r\nin request for ornaments, is unquestionably of vegetable origin; it has\r\nbeen found impacted in the trunks of its parent trees (_Wond._ p. 242).\r\nThe _fossil resin_ discovered in the London clay, at Highgate and the\r\nIsle of Sheppey, is doubtless referable to the coniferæ found in that\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nIn the Clathrariæ of Tilgate Forest, indications of a resinous\r\nsecretion have been detected.\r\n\r\nThe _Diamond_, which is pure charcoal, is probably a vegetable\r\nsecretion, that has acquired a crystalline structure by\r\nelectro-chemical forces. It has been converted into _Coke_ and\r\n_Graphite_ by the action of intense heat; and the electrical properties\r\nof the substance were changed, the Diamond being an insulator, and the\r\nCoke, a conductor of electricity. (_Wond._ p. 706.)\r\n\r\nWhen the microscope is more extensively employed in investigations of\r\nthis kind, it is probable that the siliceous spines and stars which\r\nbegem the foliage of many plants (as the _Deutzia_, _Lithospermum\r\nofficinale_, &c), will be discovered in a fossil state, for they are\r\nas indestructible as the frustules of Diatomaceæ, and the spicules of\r\nsponges which are so common in flint and chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL VEGETABLES.]\r\n\r\nBut vegetables occur not only as petrified stems, leaves. and fruits,\r\nassociated with other remains in the strata, but also in beds of great\r\nthickness and extent, consisting wholly of plants transmuted, by that\r\npeculiar process which vegetable matter undergoes when excluded from\r\natmospheric influence, and under great pressure, into _Lignite_, and\r\n_Coal_. And there are intermediate stages of this process, in which the\r\nform and structure of the trees and plants are apparent; and a gradual\r\ntransition may be traced, from the peat-wood and submerged forests\r\nof modern epochs, in which leaves, fruits, and trunks of indigenous\r\nspecies are preserved, to those ancient accumulations of carbonaceous\r\nmatter, whose vegetable origin the eye of science can alone detect.\r\n\r\nFor the collection and preservation of fossil vegetables, with the\r\nexception of those which are permeated with. pyrites (as those of\r\nthe Isle of Sheppey, &c.), but few instructions are required. The\r\nsilicified and calcareous stems are generally easy of extraction, even\r\nwhen imbedded in hard stone, and if broken can be repaired with glue.\r\nWhen the stems bear the imprints of leaf-stalks (as in _Lign._ 31 and\r\n54), the surrounding stone should be carefully examined, with the\r\nview of detecting impressions, or other indications of the foliage.\r\nDelicate leaves in clay, or shale, must not be washed; a thin coat of\r\nmastic varnish, or of gum-water, applied with a camel-hair pencil,\r\nwill preserve them, and render them more distinct. When a leaf, fruit,\r\nseed-vessel, or other fragile object is attached to clay or friable\r\nsandstone, it is advisable to glue the specimen to a piece of thin wood\r\nor pasteboard, of suitable proportions.\r\n\r\nThe Sheppey fruits and other fossils permeated with iron pyrites,\r\ngenerally decompose after a few months' exposure to the air. The\r\nfruits, especially, are liable to decomposition; Mr. Bowerbank keeps\r\nhis specimens in bottles of water; a solution of isinglass in spirits\r\nof wine is the best varnish to preserve such fossils, without obscuring\r\ntheir character and injuring their appearance: but even this method is\r\noften unavailing. The pyritified fir-cones of the Wealden decompose\r\nin like manner: I have had the misfortune to lose several unique and\r\nmost instructive specimens from this cause; boiling them in linseed oil\r\npreserves them, but greatly impairs their appearance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE FOSSIL REMAINS OF VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\nVegetable Organization.--As fragments of the stems, trunks, and\r\nbranches, are very often the only vestiges of fossil plants, a\r\nknowledge of the characters by which the principal divisions of the\r\nvegetable kingdom may be distinguished by their internal structure,\r\nis indispensable to the successful investigation of the Flora of the\r\nancient world. Although I have treated of this subject in the Wonders\r\nof Geology, (_Wond._ p. 694,) it will here be necessary to present the\r\nstudent with more ample details. The excellent introductory botanical\r\nworks of Dr. Lindley, and Professor Henslow, convey full information\r\non this, and every other department of the science, and should be\r\nconsulted by those who intend to make this branch of Geology their\r\nparticular study. For the general reader, and amateur collector,\r\nthe following brief notice of a few obvious essential characters of\r\nvegetable organization, may perhaps afford sufficient information,\r\nto enable them to understand the principles on which the successful\r\ninvestigation of the nature and affinities of fossil plants must be\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 1.\r\n\r\nSections of Recent Vegetables; illustrative of their internal\r\norganization.

In\r\nthe more complex tribes the cells become variously modified, are\r\nelongated into tubes or vessels (_vascular tissue_), some of which\r\npossess a spiral structure, and others have their sides studded with\r\nlittle glands. The vascular tissue consists of two kinds of vessels.\r\n1. The _spiral vessels_ or _tracheæ_: these are membraneous tubes,\r\nwith conical extremities, having within a coil of elastic fibre\r\nspirally twisted, and capable of being unrolled (_Lign. 1, b._).\r\n2. The _ducts_; which are a modification of the structure of the spiral\r\nvessel; their extremities are rounded or conical, and their sides\r\nmarked with transverse lines, rings, or bars. Their functions appear to\r\nbe different from those of the spiral vessels, and they are found in\r\nsituations where the latter never occur.\r\n\r\n[35] \"A _cell_ in botanical language, means a little bag composed of\r\nmembrane, and containing a living substance capable of spontaneous\r\ngrowth by multiplication, or division of its parts. Of such little\r\nbodies, millions of which may be contained within the space of a cubic\r\ninch, all the soft parts of vegetables are composed; in sea-weeds they\r\nare often of large size.\"--Dr. Harvey's Sea-side Book, with which the\r\nreader is doubtless familiar.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the stem in the whole class of flowering plants,\r\npossesses characters so evident, as to afford the most important aid in\r\nthe investigation of their fossil remains. Without dwelling on minor\r\nmodifications, they are separable into two divisions, namely, the\r\nEndogenous (signifying _to grow from within_), and the Exogenous (_to\r\ngrow from without_). Both possess vascular tissue, but so differently\r\narranged in the two classes, as to constitute distinctive characters\r\nwhich are seldom obliterated, although what was once a flexible stem,\r\nis now a mass of flint.\r\n\r\nEndogenous Stems.--As the seeds of the plants belonging to this\r\ndivision have but one cotyledon, or _seed-lobe_, as the Lily, they\r\nare also termed monocotyledonous; the reader therefore must remember\r\nthat these terms are synonymous. These stems consist of an uniform\r\nmass of cellular tissue, in which bundles of vascular or woody fibre\r\nare imbedded; a transverse section presents a surface dotted over\r\nwith spots, produced by the division of these groups of vessels,\r\npretty uniformly distributed, but more densely arranged towards the\r\ncircumference (_Lign. 1, fig. 4_). A slice of cane affords an\r\nillustration of this structure.\r\n\r\nThe increase of these stems is effected by the formation of new cells\r\nand bundles of vessels in the central axis, which force their way among\r\nthe old tissue, and occasion the condensation of the latter towards the\r\nouter edge. These plants have neither pith, concentric circles of woody\r\nfibre, nor true bark; negative characters of the highest importance in\r\nthe determination of fossil stems.\r\n\r\nExogenous Stems.--The seeds have two cotyledons, or seed-lobes,\r\nas in the Bean, hence the plants of this class are also called\r\ndicotyledonous. In these stems the cellular tissue forms a central\r\ncolumn, or pith (_Lign. 1, _fig. 2, a_.), and an external band, or\r\ncylinder, called the bark (_fig. 2, b_.); the two being connected by\r\nthin vertical plates, termed medullary rays, which are also formed\r\nof cells (_fig. 2, c, c_.); the diagram, _Lign. 1_, exhibits this\r\narrangement. The interval between the pith and the bark, and the\r\ninterspaces of the vertical radiating plates (_fig. 2, d_.), are\r\nfilled up by woody fibre or vascular tissue, consisting of spiral and\r\nother vessels. The ligneous structure of exogenous stems consists,\r\ntherefore, of a cylinder formed of wedge-shaped processes, that extend\r\nbetween the medullary rays to the pith, and is surrounded by the bark;\r\na new zone of woody fibre is added annually between the bark and the\r\nformer cylinder, and from this mode of increase the term _exogenous_\r\nis derived: a transverse section of a branch of oak or ash will show\r\nthis structure. The rings, or concentric circles, are the annual zones\r\nof wood; the fine lines radiating from the centre, or pith, to the\r\ncircumference, or bark, are the medullary rays (_Lign. 1, fig. 2, c_:\r\nsee also _Plate V. fig. 4_).\r\n\r\nThe organization above described, will be found more or less manifest\r\nin fossil wood, stems, and branches. The monocotyledonous structure is\r\nbeautifully displayed in the silicified stems of palms from Antigua\r\n(_Plate V. fig. 1, 1^a._): and the dicotyledonous, in petrified trees\r\nfrom Egypt. The pith, medullary rays, vascular tissue, and circles of\r\ngrowth, are preserved in the siliceous and calcareous wood found in\r\nmany parts of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF CONIFERÆ.]\r\n\r\nStructure of Coniferæ (_cone-bearing_).--The remains of a numerous\r\nfamily of dicotyledonous trees, termed _Coniferæ_, as the pine, fir,\r\nlarch, &c., are so abundant in the stratified rocks, that it is\r\nnecessary to describe in more detail the peculiarity of structure by\r\nwhich their stems and branches may be recognised. The most delicate\r\nwoody tissue, as we have above stated, consists of elongated cells\r\nor tubes, of two kinds: in the one, the membrane of which they are\r\ncomposed is smooth: in the other, the walls of the tubes are covered by\r\nlittle oval or circular bodies called glands (_Lign. 1, fig. 1, c._). A\r\nbranch of larch or pine, split longitudinally, and viewed by a powerful\r\nlens, will exhibit the appearance here described. This glandular\r\nstructure is so constantly and largely developed in the coniferæ, that\r\nalthough it is also possessed by other aromatic trees, we shall rarely\r\nerr in referring fossil wood in which this organization is apparent,\r\nto this family of vegetables (see _Plate V. figs. 2, 3_). These glands\r\nin the pines and firs, are supposed to be the cells which secrete a\r\ncolourless volatile oil, that exudes in the state of turpentine.\r\n\r\nFrom this general account of the vegetable structures that may be\r\nexpected to occur in the mineral kingdom, the student will in some\r\nmeasure be prepared for the investigation of fossil trees and plants;\r\nbut for the guidance of those who are wholly unacquainted with the\r\nprinciples on which the Natural System of Botany adopted in this work,\r\nis founded, I am induced to present the following concise view of the\r\nprincipal divisions of the vegetable kingdom, though it involves some\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BOTANICAL PRINCIPLES.]\r\n\r\nThe following summary is given nearly in Dr. Lindley's own language:--\r\n\r\nBotanical Principles.--One of the first things that strikes an inquirer\r\ninto the structure of plants, is the fact, that while all species are\r\ncapable of propagating their race, the mode in which this function is\r\neffected is essentially different in different cases. In most tribes\r\nof plants, flowers are produced, and these are succeeded by fruit,\r\ncontaining seed, which is shed, or scattered abroad, and grows into\r\nnew individuals. But in certain families (the _Cryptogamia_), as\r\nFerns, Mosses, Mushrooms, and the like, neither flowers, nor seeds\r\nproperly so called, have been detected; but propagation is effected\r\nby the dispersion of grains or spores, which are usually generated in\r\nthe substance of the plant, and seem to have but little analogy with\r\ntrue seeds. Hence the vegetable kingdom is separated into two distinct\r\ngroups, namely, the _flowering_ (_Phanerogamia_), and the _flowerless_\r\n(_Cryptogamia_ or _Agamia_). As the former usually possess a highly\r\ndeveloped system of spiral and other vessels, while the latter are\r\neither altogether destitute of them, or have them only in a few of the\r\nhighest orders, and those in a peculiar state, the flowering plants\r\nare termed Vasculares, and the flowerless _Cellulares_. And as all\r\nthe flowering, or vascular plants, when they form stems, increase by\r\nan extension of their ends, and a distension or enlargement of their\r\ncircumference, but the flowerless or cellular plants form their stems\r\nsimply by the addition of new matter to their points, the latter are\r\ncalled _Acrogens_, signifying increase from the summit.\r\n\r\nFlowering plants are also for the most part furnished with respiratory\r\nor breathing organs (_stomata_), of which the flowerless vegetables are\r\nto a great extent destitute.\r\n\r\nThe flowering or vascular plants are also divisible into two well\r\nmarked groups, namely, the _Exogens_, or _Dicotyledons_, and the\r\n_Endogens_, or _Monocotyledons_.\r\n\r\nThe Exogens (growing from without), increase by the addition of new\r\nwoody matter to the outside of the stems beneath the bark; and they are\r\nfurther characterized by the embryo having two or more cotyledons, or\r\nseed-lobes, hence they are also called _Dicotyledons_; such as the Elm,\r\nBeech, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Endogens, as we have previously stated, increase by the addition\r\nof ligneous matter to the inside of their stems near the centre; and\r\nas the embryo in this class has but one cotyledon, they are likewise\r\ntermed _monocotyledons_, as the Cane, Palm, &c. Again, exogenous\r\nplants have the young external wood connected with a central pith, by\r\nmedullary processes; while endogens do not possess such a structure,\r\nhaving no central pith. In exogens the veins (venation) of the leaves,\r\nare disposed in meshes, like net-work, but in endogens the veins run\r\nparallel to each other.\r\n\r\nThe number of parts in the flower of an exogenous plant is usually\r\nfive, or its multiples: in the endogens it is commonly three, or its\r\nmultiples. In the germination, the young root of exogens is a mere\r\nextension of the radicle; but in endogens it is protruded from within.\r\n\r\nThus, in the flowering or vascular plants, we have two groups distinct\r\nfrom each other in their germination, the structure of their stems\r\nand leaves, their mode of growth, the arrangement of the parts of the\r\nflower, and in the structure of the embryo.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom is thus separated into three natural classes,--1,\r\nthe _Exogens_, 2, the _Endogens_, 3, the _Acrogens_; but there are\r\nlikewise other divisions, a knowledge of which is of great importance\r\nin the study of fossil botany; the sub-class termed Gymnosperms\r\nespecially requires notice.\r\n\r\nIn the strictly exogenous and endogenous plants, the fertilizing\r\nprinciple is communicated to the young seeds through the medium of a\r\n_stigma_ and _style_, that terminate the case or pericarp in which the\r\nseeds are enclosed: but in another important group of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, the pollen is directly applied to the ovule, without the\r\nintervention of any pericarpial apparatus; hence these are termed\r\n_Gymnosperms_, signifying naked seeds. These plants have the same\r\nrelation to the other exogens, as frogs and analogous reptiles bear to\r\nthe other orders of their Class; they comprise the two natural orders\r\n_Coniferæ_, and _Cycadaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms also possess peculiarities of a subordinate nature:\r\nthus, many kinds have more than two cotyledons, and are therefore\r\ntermed _polycotyledons_; again, the radicle usually adheres to the\r\nalbumen in which the embryo lies, hence they are sometimes named\r\n_Synorhiza_. The veins of the leaves (in those whose leaves are\r\nveined), are either simple or forked; in which respect they approach\r\nthe endogens on the one hand, and the acrogens on the other.\r\n\r\nThis concise definition of the natural divisions of the vegetable\r\nkingdom will enable the reader to comprehend the botanical principles\r\nwhich must guide him in his attempt to explore the ancient floras,\r\nwhose fossil remains are generally found in a very fragmentary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI need only add that M. Ad. Brongniart, in his great work on Fossil\r\nPlants, arranges the vegetable kingdom into five classes, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. Cellular Cryptogamia,[36] or Amphigens.\r\n\r\n  2. Vascular Cryptogamia,[37] or Acrogens.\r\n\r\n  3. Monocotyledons.[38]\r\n\r\n  4. Gymnospermous Dicotyledons.[39]\r\n\r\n  5. Angiospermous Dicotyledons.[40]\r\n\r\n[36] Plants having the fructification concealed, and of cellular\r\nstructure only.\r\n\r\n[37] Plants having the fructification concealed, and with vessels, or\r\nvascular tissue.\r\n\r\n[38] Flowering plants with one cotyledon; the Endogens.\r\n\r\n[39] Plants with naked seeds; that is, destitute of a pericarp or case.\r\n\r\n[40] Plants with the seeds in a receptacle or pericarp, with a style\r\nand stigma.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MODE OF INVESTIGATING FOSSIL REMAINS OF VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INVESTIGATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.]\r\n\r\nThe distinguished authors of the British Fossil Flora justly remark,\r\nthat a few isolated, and very imperfect data, exclusively afforded by\r\nthe remains of the organs of vegetation, are but too often the sole\r\nguide to the class, order, or genus of the fossil plants which the\r\ngeologist has to examine; hence, in most instances, a general idea\r\nonly can be obtained of the nature of the original.[41] To facilitate\r\nthe study of Fossil Botany they offer some practical suggestions,\r\nwhich have served as the basis of the following directions for the\r\ninvestigation of vegetable remains, and which the previous remarks\r\nwill, we trust, render intelligible.\r\n\r\n[41] Foss. Flor. vol. I. p. xxvi.\r\n\r\n1. _The Trunk, or Stem._--Examine if the wood in a transverse section\r\nbe disposed in concentric circles (as _Plate V. fig 4_): if so, it\r\nbelonged to an exogenous tree: if, on the contrary, the wood appears\r\ndeposited irregularly in spots (_Lign. 1, fig. 4_), then the original\r\nwas endogenous. If a transverse section show remains of sinuous,\r\nunconnected layers, resembling arcs with their ends directed outwards,\r\nand of a solid structure, and imbedded among looser tissue, then it\r\nbelonged to an arborescent fern; see the subjoined figures (_Lign. 2_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 2. Sections of Fern-Stems.\r\n\r\nTransverse sections (half the diameter) of two stems of recent\r\nArborescent Ferns, to show the zone of woody fibre disposed in arcs.\r\nThis structure is seen in the silicified trunks from Chemnitz.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INVESTIGATION OF FOSSIL STEMS.]\r\n\r\nIf the stem be in a state of preservation that will admit of the\r\nslicing or chipping off a piece for microscopical investigation, the\r\nprocess described at the conclusion of this section should be employed.\r\n\r\nThe following data may be thus obtained. If the structure be entirely\r\ncellular, and it can be satisfactorily ascertained that it never\r\npossessed vascular tissue, the original belonged to the _Cryptogamia_;\r\n_i.e._ to fuci, mosses, and the like.\r\n\r\nIf it consist of parallel tubes, and has neither pith, nor rays\r\npassing from the centre to the circumference, the tree or plant was\r\n_endogenous_, like the Palm. If any trace be present of tissue crossing\r\nthe longitudinal tubes at right angles, and radiating from the centre\r\nto the circumference, this will prove the existence of medullary rays,\r\nand the original must have been _exogenous_, as the Oak, Elm, &c.: and\r\nif in a transverse section the tubes appear of equal size, the tree was\r\nprobably _coniferous_, or _cycadeous_ (_i.e._ related to the plants\r\ncalled _Cycas_ and _Zamia_); but if larger tubes appear among the\r\nsmaller ones, disposed in a definite manner (see _Plate V. fig. 4_),\r\nit belonged to some other tribe of exogenous plants.\r\n\r\nIf the walls of the tubes be studded with glands (_Lign. 1, fig. 1,\r\nc_; _Plate V. figs. 2^b 3^b_.); the fossil belongs to the Coniferæ.\r\n\r\nIf any vestige of a central pith be discovered, the exogenous nature of\r\nthe original is undoubted, for no other class, as we previously stated,\r\npossesses a central cellular column.\r\n\r\nThe absence or presence of a true cortical investment, or bark, is\r\nimportant, for a distinct bark is the characteristic of the _exogenous_\r\nclass:[42] a cortical integument, or rind, not separable from the\r\nenclosed structure, indicates the _monocotyledons_; and the entire\r\nabsence of any rind, the _cryptogamia_.\r\n\r\n[42] An apparent exception to this rule is found in the fossil genus\r\nClathraria, described hereafter, which has a distinct hollow cortical\r\ncylinder, that separates from the internal axis: this is not true bark,\r\nbut is formed by the consolidation of the bases of the petioles or\r\nleaf-stalks; see _Lign. 54_.\r\n\r\nThe markings on the stems, occasioned by the scars or cicatrices left\r\nby the separation of the petioles or leaf-stalks (as on the stalk of a\r\ncabbage), afford important evidence, since they are commonly present,\r\neven when the cylindrical trunk is compressed into a flat thin layer of\r\ncoal; as we shall often have occasion to remark. In this place it need\r\nonly be stated, that by these scars may be detected the position of the\r\nleaves, and the form of the bases of the petioles or leaf-stalks; their\r\nprobable direction, whether they were opposite, alternate, verticillate\r\nor spirally disposed, deciduous or persistent, imbricated or remote.\r\nEven when no traces of the leaves remain, the origin of the branches,\r\nand their bifurcation, may perhaps be determinable.\r\n\r\n2. _The Leaves._--In a fossil state the texture and surface of the\r\nleaves are sometimes preserved; but in general the outline of the leaf,\r\nits division and arrangement, and its mode of venation, can alone be\r\nascertained. The _venation_, that is, the form and distribution of the\r\nvascular tissue, or vessels, through the leaf, is the most important\r\ncharacter for our guidance; and Dr. Lindley offers the following\r\nsuggestions on this point. If the veins be all parallel, not branched,\r\nor only connected by little transverse bars, and the leaves undivided\r\n(as in the Lily or Hyacinth), the plant was probably endogenous; but\r\nif the leaf be divided or pinnated, it may be referable to Cycadeæ\r\n(_Lign. 45_).\r\n\r\nLeaves having the veins of equal, or nearly equal thickness, and\r\ndichotomous (_forked_), or very fine, and simply divided, belong to the\r\nfern tribe; to this division an immense proportion of the foliage found\r\nin the carboniferous strata is referable; the genera of fossil ferns\r\nhave been constructed principally from the venation.\r\n\r\nIf the veins of a leaf be obviously of unequal thickness, and\r\nreticulated, or disposed in net-like meshes, as in the rose and apple,\r\nthe original was dicotyledonous (_Plate III, figs. 4, 8_).\r\n\r\nLeaves of a large size, destitute of veins, and irregularly divided,\r\nprobably belong to fuci, or other marine plants (_Lign. 10_).\r\n\r\nSuch are the rules for the investigation and interpretation of\r\nthe characters of stems and foliage, which have been preserved by\r\nmineralization. Their application is not difficult, and the student may\r\nby their assistance obtain some general indications as to the nature of\r\nthe original trees or plants, whose petrified remains form the subject\r\nof his examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF FOSSIL VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.]\r\n\r\nMr. Nicol, who first suggested the method now generally adopted for\r\npreparing fossil wood, coal, &c. for microscopical examination, and\r\nwhich was employed by Mr. Witham in the illustrations of his beautiful\r\nwork on the structure of fossil plants,[43] has so clearly explained\r\nthe process, that by a little practice the student will be able to\r\nprepare specimens sufficiently thin for every useful purpose. Several\r\nlapidaries in London, (see list at the end of this work,) polish and\r\nmount fossil vegetables and other substances, in a very superior\r\nmanner; but their charges are high, and they frequently injure\r\nspecimens by grinding them too thin, and thus obliterating structure.\r\nI would recommend that a small chip of the specimen, if possible in\r\na _radial_ direction, should be examined by reflected light, always\r\nbeginning with the lowest object-glass and eye-piece, and ascending to\r\nthe highest power; at first without any preparation;[44] subsequently\r\nthe object should be immersed in oil of turpentine, which will render\r\nit somewhat transparent, and it then should be examined by transmitted\r\nlight. By this exploration we may detect structure, and ascertain if\r\nthe specimen be worth the trouble or expense of further preparation.\r\n\r\n[43] Observations on Fossil Vegetables. 4to. 1833.\r\n\r\n[44] The drawings in _Plate V. figs. 2 and 3_, of fossil coniferous\r\nwood, were from chips seen by reflected light, and without any\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nCoal may be prepared for examination, by removing with a sharp knife\r\na thin pellicle, or a minute scraping; immerse it in a drop of oil\r\nof turpentine on a piece of glass; then add a little Canada balsam,\r\nand hold the glass over the flame of a lamp till the balsam is spread\r\nevenly over the specimen. But without any preparation, the surface of\r\ncoal recently broken may be successfully investigated. One of the most\r\ninteresting examples of coniferous structure in coal that my cabinet\r\ncontains, was discovered by my son in a piece lying on the fire, which\r\nhad been cracked by the heat; and I have another fragment, showing\r\nthe spiral vessels, and coniferous glands, which the Rev. J. B. Reade\r\nobtained under similar circumstances. But for choice specimens, the\r\nfollowing method is to be employed; and in many cases no other plan\r\nwill succeed. Sections of teeth, bone, marble, &c. may be prepared by a\r\nlike process.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF PREPARING SLICES OF FOSSIL WOOD FOR MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\n\"Let a thin slice be cut off from the fossil wood, in a direction\r\nperpendicular to the length of its fibres--the slice thus obtained must\r\nbe ground perfectly flat, and polished. The polished surface is then to\r\nbe cemented to a piece of plate glass (3 in. long and 1 in. wide) by\r\nCanada balsam--a thin layer of balsam must be applied to the polished\r\nsurface of the slice, and also to one side of the glass--the slice and\r\nthe glass are now to be laid on any thin plate of metal, and gradually\r\nheated over a slow fire, or a spirit lamp, to concentrate the balsam.\r\nThe heat must not be so great as to throw the balsam into a state of\r\nebullition; for if air bubbles be formed, it is difficult to get rid\r\nof them, and if not removed they will prevent the complete adhesion\r\nof the two surfaces when applied to each other; the heat of the metal\r\nshould never be so great that the fingers may not be held in contact\r\nwith it for a few seconds without inconvenience. When air bubbles are\r\nformed, they should be displaced by a small piece of wood tapering to\r\na point; when the balsam is thought to be sufficiently concentrated,\r\nand all the air bubbles have disappeared, the slice and glass may be\r\ntaken from the heated metal, and pressed closely together; a slight\r\ndegree of pressure will suffice to expel the super-abundant balsam, and\r\nthis will be facilitated by gently sliding the specimen to and fro on\r\nthe glass; by this kind of motion any air that may have got entangled\r\nwhen the two surfaces were brought in contact, will also be removed.\r\nWhen the whole is cooled down to the temperature of the air, and the\r\nbalsam has become solid, that part which adheres to the surface of the\r\nglass surrounding the slice should be scraped off with the point of a\r\npenknife; and by this operation, it will at once be seen whether the\r\nbalsam has undergone the requisite concentration; for if it flakes off\r\nbefore the knife, it will be found that the slice and glass will cohere\r\nso firmly, that in the subsequent grinding, there will be no risk\r\nof their separating from each other; but if the balsam has not been\r\nsufficiently concentrated, it will slide before the knife, and in that\r\ncase the two bodies will not adhere with requisite firmness. If the\r\nlayer of balsam applied to the two surfaces be not too thick, its due\r\nconcentration will be accomplished in four or five minutes, provided\r\nthe application of the heat be properly regulated. The slice must now\r\nbe ground to that degree of thinness which will permit its structure\r\nto be seen by the help of a microscope. This will be accomplished by\r\nrubbing the slice, by a rapid circular motion with the hand, on a piece\r\nof sheet lead, supplied with a little emery (_size_ No. 1.) moistened\r\nwith water; when the emery ceases to act, the muddy matter remaining\r\nshould be removed, and a fresh portion of emery applied; this must be\r\nrepeated until the surface of the slice is perfectly flat; a sheet of\r\ncopper must then be substituted for the lead, and the fossil ground as\r\nsmooth as possible by flower of emery, freed from its coarser parts.\r\nThe surface may then be polished by friction, with _crocus_ or rotten\r\nstone, on a transverse section of any soft wood.\"[45]\r\n\r\n[45] Mr. Witham, Observations on Fossil Vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nON PEAT-WOOD, LIGNITE, AND COAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 3.

Peat.--The phenomenon of extensive tracts of\r\nmarsh-land, with layers of prostrate trees of all ages, lying but a\r\nfew feet beneath the common alluvial soil, is of frequent occurrence,\r\nboth inland, and in many places along the shores of our island. (_Geol.\r\nS. E._ p. 18). These submerged forests are generally situated below\r\nthe level of the sea, and afford unquestionable proof of subsidences\r\nof the land. The trees are of the kinds indigenous to the districts\r\nin which they occur; and leaves and seeds of the hazel, beech, elm,\r\n&c. are often preserved in the silt in which the prostrate forests are\r\nimbedded. On the Sussex coast there are accumulations of this kind, at\r\nBexhill, Pevensey levels, Felpham, &c.\r\n\r\nThe extensive subterranean forests exposed in the Fens of Lincolnshire\r\nby the operations carried on for draining that district, must be\r\nfamiliar to those who travel by the Great Northern Railway: the\r\nprotruding upright stems, broken off at a short distance above the\r\nprimitive soil, will remind the geological observer of the petrified\r\nforest of the Isle of Portland.\r\n\r\nThe wood in these cases has undergone no change but that of being dyed\r\nblack, by an impregnation of solutions of iron; and many trunks are\r\nin so sound a state as to be employed in building. The oak timbers of\r\nthe Royal George, lately raised up from off Portsmouth, after being\r\nimmersed in silt about sixty years, closely resemble in colour and\r\ntexture the wood of the submerged forests. Skeletons of deer, horse,\r\nswine, &c. are occasionally found imbedded in these subterranean\r\naccumulations of vegetable remains; and sometimes canoes, formed of the\r\ntrunk of an oak, constructed by the aboriginal inhabitants of Britain,\r\nwith stone implements called celts, are met with at considerable depths.\r\n\r\nIn the peat-bogs of Ireland (_Wond._ p. 66), large forest trees often\r\noccur, together with the skeletons of the elk, deer, and other animals\r\nof the chase; and in a few instances the bodies of the primitive\r\nhunters, wrapped in skins, have been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn Belfast Lough, a bed of peat is situated beneath the ordinary level\r\nof the waters, but is generally left bare at the ebb tides. Trunks and\r\nbranches of trees, with vast quantities of hazel nuts, are imbedded in\r\nthe peat; the whole being covered by layers of sand, and blue clay, or\r\nsilt. In most cases the pericarps of the nuts are empty, the kernels\r\nhaving perished; but on the eastern side of the Lough, which is bounded\r\nby limestone rocks, they contain calc-spar, which in some examples\r\nforms a lining of delicate crystals (_Plate V. fig. 6_); while in\r\nothers the kernel is transmuted into calcareous spar (see _Plate III.\r\nfig. 7_); but the pericarps are unchanged, and in the state of common\r\ndried nut-shells; the water which deposited the spar in their cavities\r\nnot having left a particle of mineral matter in the ligneous substance\r\nthrough which it had filtrated.\r\n\r\nIn a subterranean forest at Ferry-bridge, Yorkshire, hazel nuts in a\r\nsimilar mineralized state occur, and the branches and stems of the\r\ntrees have undergone a like change; the central ligneous axis is\r\npetrified, while the outer zones have undergone no lapidification, but\r\nremain in the state of dry rotten wood.[46]\r\n\r\n[46] Specimens are preserved in the Museum at York.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PEAT.--LIGNITE.--BROWN COAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLignite, Brown Coal, or Cannel Coal; these are terms employed to\r\ndesignate certain varieties of carbonized wood, in which the ligneous\r\nstructure is more or less distinctly preserved. Lignite may be regarded\r\nas an imperfect coal, for in its chemical properties it holds an\r\nintermediate place between peat and bituminous coal. It is for the most\r\npart found in tertiary formations, but is not unfrequent in ancient\r\nsecondary deposits, and may occur in the earliest sedimentary rocks\r\nwhich contain vegetable remains.\r\n\r\nThe newer deposits of _Brown or wood-coal_, are commonly situated in\r\ndepressions or basins, as if they had been produced by the submergence\r\nof woods and forests, in a swamp or morass; and in many instances the\r\nligneous structure is distinct in one part of the bed, while in another\r\nthe mass is a pure black coal, differing in no respect from true coal,\r\nexcept that it is less dense.\r\n\r\n_Bovey Coal._--One of the most instructive deposits of brown coal in\r\nEngland, is that of Bovey Heathfield, near Chudleigh in Devonshire,\r\nwhich is of considerable thickness and extent, and presents all the\r\ncharacters of a true coal-field; namely, beds of carbonized vegetables,\r\nalternating with layers of clay and marl. The Bovey coal is in the\r\nstate of bituminized wood, the vascular tissue (which is coniferous in\r\nthe specimens that have come under my notice) being apparent. It is\r\neasily chipped or split, and leaves a considerable quantity of white\r\nashes after combustion. The layers of coal vary in thickness from one\r\nfoot to three feet; and there are eighteen or twenty in a depth of\r\nabout 120 feet; this coal-field extends seven or eight miles. No leaves\r\nor fruits have been discovered; bitumen occurs both in the coal and\r\nin the intermediate clays. Calcareous spar, and iron pyrites, prevail\r\nin many of the strata. In some places this brown coal is covered by a\r\nbed of peat, in which trunks and cones of firs are imbedded. The whole\r\nseries appears to have been a lacustrine deposit; probably formed in a\r\nlake, into whose basin rafts of pine forests were drifted by periodical\r\nland-floods. (Org. Rem. I. p. 327).\r\n\r\nThe brown-coal formations on the banks of the Rhine, present the same\r\nphenomena on a more extended scale, and complicated with changes\r\ninduced by volcanic action. In Iceland, where at the present time\r\nforests are unknown, there are extensive deposits of lignite of a\r\npeculiar kind, termed _surturbrand_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JET.--WEALDEN COAL.]\r\n\r\n_Jet._--The beautiful substance called Jet, is a compact lignite,\r\nand the vascular tissue may be detected even in the most solid\r\nmasses; when prepared in very thin slices, it appears of a rich brown\r\ncolour by transmitted light, and the woody texture is visible to the\r\nnaked eye. Jet is found in great purity and abundance in the cliffs\r\nof alum-shale on the Yorkshire coast, which were celebrated in the\r\nearly centuries for the production of this substance. At Whitby and\r\nScarborough extensive manufactories of ornaments and trinkets of jet\r\nare established. The sandstone cliffs near Whitby contain masses of a\r\nvery compact variety, locally termed stone-jet. In the front of the\r\ncliff, on the north-west side of Haiburn Wyke, the stump of a tree\r\nwas observed in an erect position, about three feet high, and fifteen\r\ninches in diameter; the roots traversed a bed of shale, and were in the\r\nstate of coarse jet, but the trunk, which extended into the sandstone,\r\nwas in part silicified, while other portions were decayed and had a\r\nsooty aspect.[47]\r\n\r\n[47] Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast; by Rev. G. Young; 1828;\r\np. 197.\r\n\r\nThin seams and layers, and nodular masses, as well as regular\r\ncoal-fields of lignite, occur in the tertiary formations. At Castle\r\nHill, near Newhaven, in Sussex (_Wond._ p. 239), a seam of lignite\r\nresembling the surturbrand of Iceland, a few inches thick, is\r\ninterposed between strata of red marl in which are carbonized leaves of\r\ndicotyledonous trees.\r\n\r\nAt Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight, a layer of lignite occurs between the\r\nbeds of vertical gravel and sand of that interesting locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nWealden Coal.--The Wealden formation, in some districts, contains\r\nlayers of lignite, which alternate with finely laminated micaceous\r\nsandstones, marls, and clays, abounding in minute carbonized\r\nfragments of fern-leaves, with fresh-water shells, and entomostracous\r\ncrustaceans. This series of strata so strikingly resembles in its\r\ngeneral aspect the characters of a coal-field, that some years since\r\nextensive works were undertaken in Sussex, in the expectation that\r\ncoal might be obtained of suitable quality for economical purposes.\r\nThe search was unsuccessful, but the attempt deserves not the censure\r\nthat was bestowed upon it, in the infancy of geological science;[48]\r\nfor experience has since shown, that although the true coal-measures\r\nare only found beneath the Triassic and Permian formations, good\r\ncombustible bituminous coal is not necessarily restricted to any period\r\nor series of strata, but may occur wherever the local conditions\r\nwere favourable to the accumulation and bituminization of vegetable\r\nmatter. In fact, the coal-fields of the north of Germany are of the\r\nWealden epoch; and this coal more closely approaches in its chemical\r\ncharacters the black-coal of the ancient carboniferous formations,\r\nthan any of the lignites and brown-coals of the tertiary strata. Some\r\nof the beds are highly bituminous, especially those of Schaumberg,\r\nand of the principality of Bückeburg, which may rank with the best\r\nEnglish Newcastle coal; but those layers which are derived from\r\nconiferous trees and plants are more laminated, and somewhat resemble\r\nthe brown-coal. These deposits have originated for the most part from\r\ncarbonized conifers and cycads, with a few ferns and lycopodiaceæ, or\r\nclub-mosses.\r\n\r\n[48] See Sir J. F. W. Herschel's Discourse on Nat. Phil.\r\n\r\nThe brown-coal of Hohen-Warte by the Osterweld, is chiefly formed\r\nof the _Abies Linkii_, and _Pterophyllum Lyellianum_, whose leaves\r\nand twigs, closely impacted together, are generally of a brownish\r\ncolour, have a glossy surface, and, when soaked in water, are\r\nperfectly flexible. The other modification of Wealden coal appears to\r\nhave undergone a greater degree of pressure, and of exclusion from\r\nthe atmosphere; no ligneous structure is apparent, but indistinct\r\nimpressions of leaves are perceptible, and these are chiefly of ferns\r\nand club-mosses. This coal has probably resulted from an accumulation\r\nof plants of less firm texture, and more perishable, than those of\r\nwhich the former is composed.[49]\r\n\r\n[49] See Dr. Bunker's Mon. Norddeutsch. Weald.\r\n\r\nMany interesting facts relating to the carbonization of vegetables,\r\ncame under my observation during my researches in the Wealden strata;\r\nand it is a subject of regret to me, that circumstances prevented my\r\nfollowing up the investigation of those still imperfectly explored\r\ndeposits. Small nodular portions of coal, in which no structure is\r\napparent, often occur in the calciferous grit of Tilgate Forest; and\r\nsometimes large masses of lignite, fissured in every direction, and\r\nhaving the interstices filled with white calcareous spar.[50] Some of\r\nthe sandstones are discoloured by the abundance of minute particles\r\nof lignite, produced by the disintegration of ferns peculiar to the\r\ncountry of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\n[50] A fine specimen of this kind is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe original structure and composition of a plant doubtless affected\r\nits carbonization; for in the same layer of stone, the stems of\r\nEndogenites, hereafter described, invariably possess a thick, outer\r\ncrust, of coal; while those of Clathrariæ, plants allied to the Cycads,\r\nhave not a particle of carbonaceous matter, but are surrounded by a\r\nreddish brown earthy substance. The nature of the stratum in which\r\nthe plants were imbedded, must also have influenced the process\r\nof bituminization. Masses of vegetables buried beneath beds of\r\ntenacious clay, by which the escape of the gaseous elements set free\r\nby decomposition was prevented, must have been placed under the most\r\nfavourable conditions for their conversion into lignite and coal.\r\n\r\nThat the production of lignite is still going on there can be\r\nno doubt; and the following instance of a bed of recent origin,\r\naffords an instructive illustration of the subject. Near Limerick,\r\nin the district of Maine, one of the States of North America,\r\nthere are peat-bogs of considerable extent, in which a substance\r\nsimilar to cannel-coal is found at the depth of three or four feet\r\nfrom the surface, amidst the remains of rotten logs of wood, and\r\n_beaver-sticks_:[51] the peat is twenty feet thick, and rests upon\r\nwhite sand. This coal was discovered on digging a ditch to drain a\r\nportion of the bog, for the purpose of obtaining peat for manure. The\r\nsubstance is a true bituminous coal, containing more bitumen than is\r\nfound in any other variety,[AZ] Polished sections of the compact masses\r\nexhibit the peculiar structure of coniferous trees, and prove that the\r\ncoal was derived from a species allied to the American fir.\r\n\r\n[51] Pieces of wood fashioned by the beavers for the construction of\r\ntheir dams.\r\n\r\n[52] An analysis of 100 grains gave the following results:--Bitumen 72;\r\ncarbon, 21; oxide of iron, 4; silica, 1; oxide of manganese, 2; = 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COAL.]\r\n\r\nCoal.--We proceed to the examination of that remarkable substance which\r\nhas resulted from the perfect bituminization of the vegetables of the\r\nmost ancient Flora which geological researches have brought to light,\r\nand to which the term _Coal_ is commonly restricted.\r\n\r\nAlthough Balthazar Klein in the sixteenth century affirmed that coal\r\nowed its formation to wood and other vegetable substances,[53] yet I\r\ncan well remember when many eminent geologists were sceptical on this\r\npoint; and the truth in this, as in most other questions of natural\r\nphilosophy, was established with difficulty. The experiments and\r\nobservations of the late Dr. Macculloch, mainly contributed to solve\r\nthe problem as to the vegetable nature of this substance; and that\r\neminent chemist and geologist successfully traced the transition of\r\nvegetable matter from peat-wood, brown-coal, lignite, and jet, to\r\ncoal, anthracite, graphite, and plumbago. Nor must the meritorious\r\nlabours of that accomplished naturalist, and excellent man, the late\r\nMr. Parkinson, author of the \"_Organic Remains of a Former World_,\"\r\nin this field of research, be forgotten.[54] The first volume of that\r\nwork, which treats on fossil plants, contains much original information\r\non the transmutation of vegetables into the various mineral substances\r\nin which the nature and original structure of the originals are\r\naltogether changed and obliterated; it may still be consulted by the\r\nstudent with advantage.\r\n\r\n[53] Sternberg's \"Flore du Monde Primitif.\"\r\n\r\n[54] See my \"Pictorial Atlas of Organic Remains,\" 1850.\r\n\r\nAlthough the vegetable origin of all coal will not admit of question,\r\nyet evidence of the internal organization of the plants of which it\r\nis composed, is not always attainable; for the most perfect coal\r\nhas undergone a complete liquefaction, and if any portions of the\r\nstructure remain, they appear under the microscope as if imbedded in\r\na pure bituminous mass. The slaty coal generally preserves traces of\r\ncellular or vascular tissue, and the spiral vessels, and the dotted\r\ncells of coniferous trees, may readily be detected in chips or slices,\r\nprepared in the manner previously pointed out (_ante_, p. 66). In\r\nmany examples the cells are filled with an amber-coloured resinous\r\nsubstance; in others the organization is so well preserved, that on\r\nthe exposed surface of a piece of coal cracked by exposure to heat,\r\nthe vascular tissue, spiral vessels, and cells studded with glands,\r\nmay be detected. Even in the white ashes left after combustion, traces\r\nof the spiral vessels are often discernible under a highly magnifying\r\npowder. Some beds of coal are wholly composed of minute leaves and\r\ndisintegrated foliage; and if a mass recently extracted from the mine\r\nbe split asunder, the surface is seen to be covered with flexible\r\npellicles of carbonized leaves and fibres, matted together; and flake\r\nafter flake may be peeled off through a thickness of many inches,\r\nand the same structure be apparent. Rarely are any large trunks or\r\nbranches observable in the coal; the appearance of many beds being that\r\nof a deposit of foliage, shed and accumulated in a forest, (as may be\r\nobservable in existing pine-districts,) and consolidated by pressure,\r\nwhile undergoing that peculiar change by which vegetable matter is\r\nconverted into a carbonaceous mass.\r\n\r\nIn fine, a gradual transition may be traced from the peat-wood and\r\nsubmerged forests of modern times, in which leaves, fruits, and trunks\r\nof indigenous trees and plants are preserved, to those vast deposits of\r\nmineral coal, formed by the bituminization of the extinct Floras which\r\nflourished in the palæozoic ages.\r\n\r\nThe geological position of the ancient coal, the manner in which it\r\nis interstratified with layers of clay, shale, micaceous sandstone,\r\ngrit, and ironstone--in some districts associated with beds of\r\nfresh-water shells (_Sil. Syst._ p. 84)--in others alternating with\r\nstrata containing marine remains,--are fully treated of in _Wond._\r\npp. 729-733, and _Bd._ p. 525; and it is not within the scope of the\r\npresent work to dwell in detail upon what may be termed the physical\r\ngeology of the carboniferous deposits. But a few observations on the\r\nphenomena presented by these accumulations of bituminized vegetables\r\nand their associated strata, are necessary to render the subsequent\r\nremarks on the habits and affinities of the plants composing the\r\npalæozoic Flora intelligible to the general reader.\r\n\r\nWhile the essential conditions for the conversion of vegetable\r\nsubstances into coal appear to be the imbedding of large quantities\r\nof recent trees and plants in a deposit which shall exclude the air,\r\nand prevent the escape of the gaseous elements when released by\r\ndecomposition from their organic combination, so, according to the\r\nmore or less perfect manner in which these conditions are fulfilled,\r\nwill result coal, jet, lignite, brown-coal, or peat-wood; or a mass of\r\npartially carbonized vegetables, like that observable when new-mown\r\nhay undergoes spontaneous combustion, from bituminous fermentation in\r\nthe atmosphere (_Wond._ p. 701. _Org. Rem._ I. p. 181).\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the carboniferous strata have been deposited, has\r\nbeen a subject of much discussion. Some contend that the coal-measures\r\nwere originally in the state of peat-bogs, and that the successive\r\nlayers were formed by the subsidences of forests which grew on the\r\nsites now occupied by their carbonized remains; others suppose\r\nthat the vegetable matter originated from rafts, like those of the\r\nMississippi, which floated out to sea, and became engulfed; while\r\nmany affirm that the coal-measures were accumulated in inland seas\r\nor lakes, the successive beds of vegetable matter being supplied by\r\nperiodical land-floods; and the supporters of each hypothesis bring\r\nnumerous facts in corroboration of their respective opinions. There\r\ncan, I think, be no doubt that the production of coal has taken place\r\nunder each of these conditions, and that at different periods, and in\r\nvarious localities, all these causes have been in operation; in some\r\ninstances singly, in others in combination. Coal may have been formed\r\nat the bottom of fresh-water lakes, as in those instances where it is\r\nassociated with fresh-water shells and crustaceans, as at Burdie House\r\n(_Wond._ p. 693), and in some of the Derbyshire and Yorkshire deposits;\r\nin the beds of rivers and estuaries, as in the Wealden, and in the\r\nShrewsbury coal-field;[55] and from drifted forests, like the rafts\r\nof the American rivers, transported into the sea, and engulfed in the\r\nabyss of the ocean;[56] and the remains of terrestrial, lacustrine,\r\nand marine animals, may accordingly be found associated with it.[BE]\r\nBut though many coal-fields (or basins, as they are termed, because\r\nthey occupy depressions) have evidently been produced by different, and\r\nlocal agencies, the sedimentary deposits and coal-beds comprised in the\r\ncarboniferous formations, setting aside unimportant variations, present\r\na remarkable uniformity of character in their nature and arrangement,\r\nnot only throughout Great Britain and Europe, but in every other part\r\nof the known world.\r\n\r\n[55] In this coal-field are beds of limestone several feet thick,\r\nabounding in cyprides, fresh-water mollusks, &c.--_Sil. Syst._ p, 84.\r\n\r\n[56] The immense thicknesss of some coal-beds, without any\r\nintercalations of earthy materials, seems to be inexplicable on any\r\nother supposition but that of accumulations of drift-wood and plants.\r\nIn the Great Exhibition of 1851, there was exhibited, on the outside of\r\nthe west end of the Crystal Palace, a section of the lowest bed of coal\r\nfrom Tividale Colliery in South Staffordshire, the total thickness of\r\nwhich was 29 feet, with no intermixture whatever of sediment, except\r\nsome thin shaly partings: the entire mass was composed of carbonized\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n[57] Sir R. I. Murchison has treated this subject with great ability:\r\nsee _Sil. Syst._ chap, xi., and the illustrative maps opposite, p. 152.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRATIFICATION OF A COAL-FIELD.]\r\n\r\nStratification of a Coal-field.--The group of strata constituting a\r\ncoal-field consists of an alternation of layers of coal and of clay,\r\nof variable thickness, resting, very generally, on grit, or marine\r\nlimestone abounding in shells, corals, and crinoidea.\r\n\r\nMy late excellent friend, Mr. Bakewell, used to exemplify the\r\nmanner in which the beds of coal are interstratified with layers of\r\nclay and shale, by the following apt illustration; let a series of\r\nmussel-shells be placed one within the other, and a layer of clay be\r\ninterposed between each; the shells will represent the beds of coal,\r\nand the partitions of clay the earthy strata intercalated between the\r\ncarboniferous layers; now, if one side of the series of shells be\r\nraised to indicate the general rise of the strata in that direction,\r\nand the whole be dislocated by partial cracks and fissures, the general\r\narrangement and subsequent displacement of the beds will be represented.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature which arrests attention on the examination of\r\nthe section of a coal-pit, is the uniform presence of a thick bed\r\nof clay beneath every layer of coal; but a still more extraordinary\r\nfact remains to be mentioned, namely, that a common plant of the\r\ncoal strata, called Stigmaria, (hereafter described, see _Lign.\r\n36, 38_,) invariably occurs, more or less abundantly, in this bed of\r\nunder-day, although very rarely to be met with in the coal or shale\r\nabove. This phenomenon, long since noticed by Martin, Macculloch, and\r\nother authors, but whose value was not duly estimated till the recent\r\nobservations of Mr. Logan, (_Geol. Proc._ vol. iii. p. 275,) is also\r\nfound to prevail throughout the Welsh coal formation, which is upwards\r\nof twelve thousand feet in thickness, and contains more than sixty\r\nbeds of coal, and as many of clay with stigmariæ; the Appalachian\r\ncoal-measures of the United States present the same characters.[58] To\r\nplace this fact before the student in a clear point of view, I will\r\ndescribe one of the triple series of beds which compose a coal-field.\r\n\r\n[58] See Prof. Rogers, in the Proceedings of the American Geologists,\r\np. 453; and Sir C. Lyell's Travels in America.\r\n\r\n1. _Under-clay_; the lowermost stratum. A tough argillaceous substance,\r\nwhich upon drying becomes a grey friable earth: it is occasionally\r\nblack, from the presence of carbonaceous matter. It contains\r\ninnumerable stems of stigmariæ, which are generally of considerable\r\nlength, and have their rootlets or fibres (see _Lign. 38_) attached,\r\nand extending in every direction through the clay: these stems commonly\r\nlie parallel with the planes of the bed, and nearer to the top than to\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n2. _Coal._ A carbonized mass, in which the external forms of the plants\r\nand trees composing it are obliterated, but the internal structure\r\nremains; large trunks or stems, and leaves, are rarely distinguishable\r\nin it, but the presence of coniferous wood in many beds of coal, proves\r\nthat this arises, not from the absence of trees, but from their\r\nexternal forms having been obliterated.\r\n\r\n3. _The Roof_, or upper bed. This generally consists of slaty clay,\r\nabounding in leaves, trunks, stems, branches, and fruits, and\r\ncontains layers and nodules of ironstone, inclosing leaves, insects,\r\ncrustaceans, &c.\r\n\r\nIn some localities beds of fresh-water mussels, and in others of marine\r\nshells, are intercalated; layers of shale, finely laminated clay,\r\nmicaceous sand and grit, and pebbles of limestone, granite, sandstone,\r\nand other rocks, are often present. The most illustrative examples\r\nof the foliage of the carboniferous flora are found in this deposit,\r\nwhich appears to be an accumulation of drifted materials derived from\r\nother rocks, and promiscuously intermingled with the dense foliage and\r\nstems of a prostrate forest; the whole having been transported from a\r\ndistance by a powerful current or flood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN AND NATURE OF COAL.]\r\n\r\nThus we have, in the first place, spread uniformly over the bottom,\r\nand constituting the bed on which the coal reposes, a stratum of clay\r\n(_Under-clay_), composed of fine pulverulent materials, which may have\r\nonce constituted the soil of a vast plain or savannah; the only remains\r\nfound in it are the roots of gigantic trees (see _Lign. 36_); for such\r\nthe stigmariæ are now proved to have been, and not aquatic plants, as\r\nwas formerly supposed (_Bd._ p. 476).\r\n\r\nSecondly, a bituminous mass (Coal), composed of coniferous wood,\r\ngigantic ferns, club-mosses, &c.; occasionally with trunks of trees\r\npenetrating vertically through it.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a deposit of drift or water-worn materials (_the Roof_), mixed\r\nwith the foliage and stems of numerous species of terrestrial plants;\r\nthe whole appearing to have been subjected to the action of currents.\r\nThe first, or _Under-clay_, may have been the natural soil, in which\r\nthe stigmariæ grew; the next,--the _Coal_,--the carbonized stems, and\r\nother remains of the trees to which the roots belonged: and the last,\r\nor uppermost, forming the roof of the coal, may have resulted from\r\nthe foliage and branches of a prostrate forest, overwhelmed and buried\r\nbeneath the transported detritus of distant rocks.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena may be explained by supposing the inundation of a\r\nthickly-wooded plain from an irruption of the sea; or of a vast\r\ninland lake, occasioned by the sudden removal of some barrier; or\r\nby a subsidence of the tract of country on which the forest grew.\r\nBut when we find an accumulation of strata, in which triple deposits\r\nof this kind are repeated some thirty or forty times through a\r\nthickness of many thousand feet, this solution of the problem is not\r\nsatisfactory. Not only subsidence after subsidence must have taken\r\nplace, but the first submergence have been followed by an elevation\r\nof the land--another soil, fit for the growth of forest trees, must\r\nhave been produced--another generation of vegetables, of precisely the\r\nsame species and genera, have sprung up, and arrived at maturity--and\r\nthen another subsidence, and another accumulation of drift. And these\r\nperiodical oscillations in the relative level of the land and water\r\nmust have gone on uninterruptedly through a long period of time, not\r\nin one district or country only, but in various parts of the world,\r\nduring the same geological epoch. At present I do not think we have\r\ndata sufficient to explain these phenomena; what has been advanced\r\nmay, perhaps, serve to elicit further information, by pointing out\r\nthe difficulties in which the question is involved, and showing\r\nwhat interesting fields of discovery are still unexplored, and how\r\ncomprehensive and important are the objects that come within the scope\r\nof geological investigation.[59]\r\n\r\n[59] I would refer the student for a fuller consideration of the\r\nphenomena thus briefly noticed, to the 6th edition of my Wonders of\r\nGeology, pp. 669, 718, 731.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with the following beautiful reflections\r\nof Dr. Buckland on the origin and nature of Coal, and the changes it\r\nundergoes when rendered subservient to the necessities and luxuries of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Few persons are aware of the remote and wonderful events in the\r\neconomy of our planet, and of the complicated applications of human\r\nindustry and science, which are involved in the production of the coal\r\nthat supplies with fuel the metropolis of England.\r\n\r\n\"The most early stage to which we can carry back its origin, was among\r\nthe swamps and forests of the primeval earth, where it flourished\r\nin the form of gigantic Calamites, and stately _Lepidodendra_, and\r\n_Sigillariæ_. From their native bed, these plants were transported\r\ninto some adjacent lake, or estuary, or sea. Here they floated on the\r\nwaters, until they sank saturated to the bottom, and being buried in\r\nthe detritus of adjacent lands, became transferred to a new estate\r\namong the members of the mineral kingdom. A long interment followed,\r\nduring which a course of chemical changes, and new combinations of\r\ntheir vegetable elements, converted them to the mineral condition of\r\ncoal. By the elevating force of subterranean agency, these beds of\r\ncoal have been uplifted from beneath the waters, to a new position in\r\nthe hills and mountains, where they are accessible to the industry of\r\nman. From this fourth stage, coal has been removed by the labours of\r\nthe miner, assisted by the arts and sciences, that have co-operated to\r\nproduce the steam-engine, and the safety-lamp. Returned once more to\r\nthe light of day, and a second time committed to the waters, it has,\r\nby the aid of navigation, been conveyed to the scene of its next and\r\nmost considerable change by fire; a change during which it becomes\r\nsubservient to the most important wants and conveniences of man. In\r\nthis seventh stage of its long eventful history, it seems, to the\r\nvulgar eye, to undergo annihilation; its elements are, indeed, released\r\nfrom the mineral combinations which they have maintained for ages, but\r\ntheir apparent destruction is only the commencement of new successions\r\nof change and of activity. Set free from their long imprisonment, they\r\nreturn to their native atmosphere, from which they were absorbed by the\r\nprimeval vegetation of the earth. To-morrow they may contribute to the\r\nsubstance of timber, in the trees of our existing forests; and having\r\nfor a while resumed their place in the living vegetable kingdom, may,\r\nere long, be applied a second time to the use and benefit of man. And\r\nwhen decay or fire shall once more consign them to the earth, or to the\r\natmosphere, the same elements will enter on some further department of\r\ntheir perpetual ministration in the economy of the material world.\"[60]\r\n\r\n[60] Bd p. 481.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present section of this work, I propose to explain the botanical\r\narrangement and nomenclature of fossil plants; and figure and describe\r\none or more species of the genera that are most likely to come\r\nunder the observation of the student, either in public or private\r\ncollections, or in the course of his researches in the field.\r\n\r\nTo determine the botanical relations of fossil leaves and stems,\r\nreference must be had to works expressly devoted to the subject;\r\nnamely, the \"_British Fossil Flora_,\" by Dr. Lindley and Mr. Hutton,\r\nand the \"_Histoire des Végétaux Fossiles_,\" by M. Adolphe Brongniart.\r\nThe classification of the last-named eminent botanist is here adopted,\r\nas the most easy of application.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the nomenclature, it may be necessary to remark, that\r\nwhen a fossil plant undoubtedly belongs to a recent genus, the usual\r\nbotanical name is employed: for example, _Equisetum Lyellii_; when the\r\nfossil does not possess all the generic characters, yet is evidently\r\nallied to a recent genus, the term _ites_ (from λιθος, _lithos_,\r\nstone), is added--as _Equisetites_, _Palmacites_, &c.; and this\r\ntermination is invariably adopted by some authors. When the fossil\r\nplant differs altogether from any known type, it is distinguished by\r\nsome arbitrary generic name, as _Bucklandia_, _Sigillaria_, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few provisional genera for the reception of fossil\r\nleaves, fruits, and stems, whose characters and relations are but\r\nimperfectly known; as Carpolithes, Endogenites, &c. Upon these\r\nprinciples the present arrangement has been founded: the progress of\r\ndiscovery will, of course, be continually adding to the list, and the\r\nclassification require to be modified.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CRYPTOGAMIA.]\r\n\r\nThe following account of the principal types of the ancient floras\r\nwhose relics are preserved in the mineral kingdom, though commencing\r\nwith those of the most simple structure, the _Cryptogamia_, and\r\nadvancing to the higher orders, is not strictly botanical; for it was\r\nfound convenient, in some instances, to notice certain species and\r\ngenera of different orders under the same head, from their occurrence\r\nin the same geological formations.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that not more than two thousand species of plants have\r\nbeen discovered in a fossil state, while the known recent species\r\namount to upwards of eighty thousand.\r\n\r\nCellular Cryptogamia; Algæ.--The plants designated by botanists _Algæ_,\r\nand commonly known as sea-weeds, lavers, and fresh-water mosses, are\r\nof the most simple structure--mere aggregations of cells--but present\r\ninnumerable varieties of form and magnitude: many species are mere\r\nvesicles of such minuteness as to be invisible to the unassisted eye,\r\nexcept accumulated in countless myriads, when they appear as a green,\r\npurple, or reddish, slime in the water; or as a film on wood or stone,\r\nor on the ground, in damp situations; while others are tough branched\r\nmarine plants, many fathoms in length.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ form three principal groups: 1. the _jointless_, as the\r\nFuci, the Dulses, Tangles, and Lavers: 2. the _jointed_, which are\r\ncomposed of thread-like articulated tubes; such are the fresh-water\r\nConfervæ: 3. the _disjointed_, or Brittle-worts, so called from their\r\nspontaneous self-division, which is in some kinds complete, in others\r\nonly partial; and these, by separating transversely, and leaving\r\neach cell or frustule attached at the angles, produce those beautiful\r\nchains of angular green transparent cases, so constantly seen under\r\nthe microscope when substances from fresh-water streams or lakes are\r\nsubmitted to examination.\r\n\r\nAs many of these forms are endowed with spontaneous motion, and possess\r\nother properties common to animal organization, it is not surprising\r\nthat their vegetable nature was doubted, and that even so profound\r\na naturalist as M. Ehrenberg placed them in the animal kingdom:\r\nthe greater number being comprised in his family of _Bacillariæ_,\r\nwere described in the former edition of this work, as Infusoria or\r\nAnimalcules; in conformity with the classification of the illustrious\r\nmicroscopist, whose splendid works and indefatigable labours have so\r\ngreatly promoted the advancement of microscopical investigation.[61]\r\n\r\n[61] The whole of the objects called _Infusoria_ in the first edition\r\nof \"The Medals of Creation\" belong to various kinds of Diatomaceæ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DIATOMACEÆ.]\r\n\r\nThese minute vegetable organisms are placed by botanists in two\r\ntribes, the _Diatomaceæ_ or the _Brittle-worts_, and the _Desmidieæ_.\r\nThe latter are exclusively inhabitants of fresh-water, while a large\r\nproportion of the former are marine plants. Some naturalists (M.\r\nBrébisson) restrict the name _Diatomaceæ_ to those species which\r\nsecrete siliceous envelopes; and that of _Desmidieæ_ to those whose\r\nstructures are not siliceous, and are reducible by heat to carbon. As\r\nthe durable parts of these plants alone concern the geologist, the name\r\n_Diatomaceæ_ will be employed as a general term in reference to their\r\nfossil remains.\r\n\r\nThese tribes of Algæ abound in every lake and stream of fresh-water,\r\nin every pool or bay, and throughout the ocean from the equator to\r\nthe poles. Certain kinds of sea-weeds secrete carbonate of lime; but\r\nthe Diatomaceæ have the power of separating silex, or the earth of\r\nflint, from the water, by some unknown process, and their tissues are\r\ncomposed of pure quartz: hence, under the microscope, their remains,\r\nconsisting wholly of rock crystal, exhibit the most exquisite forms,\r\nelaborately fretted and ornamented (see _Lign. 4_). After the death and\r\ndecomposition of these plants, their durable frustules or cases appear\r\nas colourless discs, cups, spheres, shields, &c., and these accumulate\r\nat the bottom of the water in such inconceivable numbers, as to form\r\nstrata of great thickness and extent. Slowly, imperceptibly, and\r\nincessantly, are the vital energies of these atoms separating from the\r\nelement in which they live the most refractory and enduring of mineral\r\nsubstances, silex, and elaborating it into imperishable structures, and\r\nthus adding enormous contributions to the accumulations of detritus,\r\nwhich make up the sedimentary rocks of the crust of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe extent of this infinitesimal flora throughout regions where no\r\nother forms of vegetation are known, is strikingly demonstrated by the\r\nobservations of our eminent botanical traveller. Dr. Joseph Hooker, in\r\nhis account of the Antarctic regions.[62]\r\n\r\n[62] \"On the Botany of the South Polar Regions;\" in Sir J. Ross's\r\nVoyage of Discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere,\" Dr. Hooker states, \"the waters and the ice alike abound\r\nin these microscopic vegetables. Though too small to be visible to\r\nthe unassisted eye, their aggregated masses stained the iceberg and\r\npack-ice wherever the latter were washed by the sea, and imparted a\r\npale ochreous colour to the ice. From the south of the belt of ice\r\nwhich encircles the globe, to the highest latitudes reached by man,\r\nthis vegetation is everywhere conspicuous, from the contrast between\r\nits colour and that of the white snow and ice in which it is imbedded.\r\n\r\n\"In the 80° of south latitude all the surface ice carried along by\r\ncurrents, and the sides of every berg, and the base of the great\r\nVictoria barrier itself--a perpendicular wall of ice, from one to two\r\nhundred feet above the sea level--were tinged brown from this cause, as\r\nif the waters were charged with oxide of iron. The majority of these\r\nplants consist of simple vegetable cells enclosed in indestructible\r\nsilex; and it is obvious that the death of such multitudes must form\r\nsedimentary deposits of immense extent.\r\n\r\n\"The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of the\r\nAntarctic Ocean is a truly wonderful fact, and the more so from its\r\nbeing unaccompanied by plants of a high order. This ocean swarms with\r\nmollusca, and entomostracous crustaceans, small whales, and porpoises;\r\nand the sea with penguins and seals, and the air with birds; the animal\r\nkingdom is everywhere present, the larger creatures preying on the\r\nsmaller, and these again on those more minute; all living nature seems\r\nto be carnivorous. This microscopic vegetation is the sole nutrition\r\nof the herbivorous animals; and it may likewise serve to purify the\r\natmosphere, and thus execute in the Antarctic latitudes the office of\r\nthe trees and grasses of the temperate regions, and the broad foliage\r\nof the palms of the tropics.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker also remarks that the siliceous envelopes of the same kinds\r\nof diatomaceæ now living in the waters of the South Polar Ocean, have\r\ncontributed in past ages to the formation of European strata; for the\r\ntripoli and the phonolite stones of the Rhine, contain the siliceous\r\nenvelopes of identical species.\r\n\r\nSuch are the comments of one of our most distinguished botanists, on\r\nthe phenomena under review. The reader will perhaps ask, what then are\r\nthe essential characters which separate the animal from the vegetable\r\nkingdom? To this question it is impossible to give a satisfactory\r\nreply: perhaps the only distinction that will be generally admitted by\r\nzoologists and botanists is the following:--_animals require organic\r\nsubstances for their support; vegetables derive their sustenance from\r\ninorganic matter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECENT DIATOMACEÆ.]\r\n\r\nRecent Diatomaceæ. _Plate IV._--To familiarize the reader with\r\nthe nature of these vegetable organisms, a few recent species are\r\nrepresented in Plate IV., coloured as they appear when alive, under the\r\nmicroscope; the figures are magnified as expressed by the fractions.\r\n\r\n_Xanthidium._ _Plate IV. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5._--The case or frustule\r\nof this genus consists of a hollow, siliceous globe, beset with\r\nspines. The increase of the Xanthidia by self-division, produces the\r\ndouble appearance in the figures, all of which are in the progress of\r\nseparation.[63]\r\n\r\n[63] The organisms so abundant in the flint and chalk, and which were\r\nreferred by M. Ehrenberg to this genus, and consequently described\r\nunder the name of Xanthidia by myself and others, are certainly in\r\nnowise related to the recent forms: they are flexible envelopes, and\r\nprobably belong to zoophytes; as will be shown in the sequel.\r\n\r\n_Pyxidiculum._ _Plate IV. fig. 2._--The case is a little saucer-shaped\r\nbox, and is invested by a membrane.\r\n\r\n_Bacillaria._ _Plate IV. fig. 6._--A simple siliceous frustule, of a\r\nprismatic shape, forming a brilliant chain, which often appears in\r\nzigzag, in consequence of incomplete self-division. An immense number\r\nand variety of forms are placed in this family by Ehrenberg, with\r\na multitude of generic and specific names. The fresh-water species\r\ninhabit every pond and lake, and the marine every sea. Fossil species\r\nare equally abundant.\r\n\r\n_Cocconeis._ _Plate IV. fig. 7._--This is a very elegant type; the\r\nfrustule consists of a simple siliceous case, with a central opening;\r\nit never occurs in chains like the former. It has been found fossil\r\nnear Cassel.\r\n\r\n_Navicula._ _Plate IV. figs. 8, 9, 14, 15._--The plants of this genus\r\nare free, and float in the water apparently by the agency of cilia.\r\nTheir case is a boat-like envelope with six openings, composed of pure\r\nsilex, and in many species is exquisitely ornamented. Figs. 8 and 9.\r\nshow a living _Navicula_, viewed in front, and in profile: in _fig. 9_\r\nare represented the currents produced when the body is moving through\r\nthe water; after Ehrenberg. Fossil _Naviculæ_ abound in many tertiary\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\n_Galionella._ _Plate IV. figs. 10, 11._--These algæ are free, and the\r\nfrustules of a cylindrical, globular, or discoidal form; they occur in\r\nchains, in consequence of the self-division being imperfect, and the\r\nnew individuals remaining attached to the old. The _Galionellæ_ are\r\nmost abundant and prolific, and inhabit every pool, stream, and lake:\r\nfossil species occur in the Virginian marls, and other strata.\r\n\r\n_Synhedra._ _Plate IV. fig. 12._--The frustules are siliceous, and of a\r\nslender, elongated form. The plant is attached by the base (_fig. 12\r\na._) in youth, and afterwards becomes free. It is found fossil in the\r\nMountain-meal of Santa Flora, and many other deposits.\r\n\r\n_Podosphenia._ _Plate IV. fig. 13._--The frustule is cruciform, or\r\nwedge-shaped, and attached in youth by the small end, but afterwards\r\nbecomes free. These plants are often arranged in clusters, as in\r\nthe figure. M. Ehrenberg states that they inhabit the sea, and not\r\nfresh-water; but I have found them in streams communicating with the\r\nThames. _Podospheniæ_ abound in the polishing slate of Bilin.\r\n\r\n_Eunotia._ _Plate IV. figs. 16, 17._--The frustule is siliceous, and\r\neither simple or bivalve; flat below, and convex, and often richly\r\ndentated above. An empty case is shown _fig. 16_; and a group of living\r\n_Eunotice_ attached to a stem of conferva, _fig. 17_. Several fossil\r\nspecies have been discovered at Santa Flora.\r\n\r\nThat the general reader, whose attention is for the first time\r\ndirected to this subject, may be prepared for the enormous deposits\r\nof fossil diatomaceæ that are found in some formations, I subjoin the\r\nobservations of Dr. Bailey on an elegant fragile species, which hangs\r\ntogether in clusters, appearing like spiral chains, and is about 1/20\r\nof a line in diameter; it is named _Meridion vernale_.\r\n\r\n\"This fresh-water plant is seen in immense quantities in the mountain\r\nbrooks around West Point, the bottoms of which are literally covered\r\nin the first warm days of spring with a ferruginous-coloured mucous\r\nmatter, about a quarter of an inch thick, that, on examination by the\r\nmicroscope, proves to be filled with millions and millions of these\r\nexquisitely beautiful siliceous organisms. Every submerged stone, twig,\r\nand spear of grass, is enveloped by them; and the waving plume-like\r\nappearance of a filamentous body covered in this manner, is often\r\nextremely elegant. Alcohol completely dissolves the endochrome (_soft\r\ncolouring matter_) of this species, and the frustules are left as\r\ncolourless as glass, and resist the action of fire.\"[64]\r\n\r\n[64] Trans. Amer. Assoc. Geolog. 1843, p. 152.\r\n\r\nThe yellow or ochreous scum observable in ponds, ditches, and\r\nstagnant pools, is an aggregation of diatomaceæ, whose frustules are\r\nferiniginous, and of such extreme minuteness, that a billion of their\r\ncases would not be more than a cubic inch in bulk.[65]\r\n\r\n[65] Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nFossil Diatomaceæ.--From this notice of a few recent types, we proceed\r\nto the investigation of the fossil remains of this tribe of Algæ.\r\n\r\nIn peat-bogs and swamps, both of modern and ancient date, masses of\r\na white marly or siliceous paste (_hydrate of silica_), are often\r\nobserved, and these are found upon microscopical observation to\r\nbe wholly made up of the frustules of _Naviculæ_, _Bacillariæ_,\r\n_Galionellæ_, &c., with an intermixture of the needle-like spicules of\r\nfresh-water sponges. Many of the peat-bogs of Ireland contain layers of\r\na white earthy substance, which, when dry, is of the appearance and\r\nconsistence of friable chalk, and entirely consists of the siliceous\r\ncases of various kinds of diatomaceæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 4. Siliceous Frustules of Diatomaceæ, and Spicules\r\nof Spongillæ; from a deposit on the banks of the river Bann, Ireland.\r\n\r\n(_Seen by transmitted light, and highly magnified._)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DIATOMACEÆ OF IRELAND.]\r\n\r\nFossil Diatomaceæ from Ireland, _Lign. 4._--Dr. Drummond describes\r\na bed of this kind near the base of the Mourne Mountains, in the\r\nCounty of Down, Ireland. It consists of a very light white substance,\r\nresembling in appearance carbonate of magnesia: it has a coarse and\r\nsomewhat fibrous fracture, and is easily reduced to powder. It is\r\nalmost entirely siliceous, and is composed of the cases of diatomaceæ\r\nof the usual fresh-water species, without any admixture of inorganic\r\nmatter.[66]\r\n\r\n[66] Mag. Nat. Hist. New Series, vol. iii. p. 353, July 1839.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the river Bann, in the same county, there is an\r\nextensive stratum of a similar earth, and which, from being in much\r\nrequest for polishing plate, is locally known as Lord Roden's plate\r\npowder. This earth is wholly made up of the siliceous frustules of many\r\nkinds of this tribe of Algæ, and a few grains under the microscope\r\nyield a great variety of exquisite forms: figures of several are\r\ngiven in _Lign. 4_, from specimens of this earth, with which I was\r\nfavoured by the Countess of Caledon. They comprise two or three species\r\nof Navicula, Galionella, Coscinodiscus, Gomphonema, Bacillaria,\r\nStauroneis, &c., and spicules or spines of fresh-water sponges.[67]\r\n\r\n[67] The names of the usual kinds of Diatomaceous frustules may be\r\nlearnt by reference to Mr. Andrew Pritchard's abstract (with coloured\r\nfigures) of Ehrenberg's Infusoria. The splendid work of Mr. Ralfs, on\r\nthe British Desmidieæ, 1 vol. 4to, with coloured plates, is the best\r\nguide for those who wish to study the recent plants.\r\n\r\nBeds of siliceous marl--that is, of argillaceous earth combined with\r\na large amount of minute particles of silex, all of which prove to be\r\norganisms when examined by a high magnifying power,--have been found in\r\nnumerous places not only in England, but all over the world, since M.\r\nEhrenberg first directed attention to their nature and origin.\r\n\r\nNear Bryansford (Newcastle), Binstwick in Holderness, and in the Fens\r\nof Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, extensive fresh-water microphytal\r\ndeposits have been discovered and examined.\r\n\r\nFrom our Antipodes I have received many examples of these vegetable\r\nearths. My eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell, discovered an extensive bed\r\nof white marl on the banks of the great brackish-water lake of Waihora,\r\nin the middle island of New Zealand, consisting entirely of frustules\r\nof Bacillariæ. From New Plymouth he obtained some new and exquisite\r\nforms of Navicula, Stauroneis, &c.; ranges of low hillocks of sand,\r\nof considerable extent, being made up of microphytes (_microscopic\r\nplants_).[68]\r\n\r\n[68] See a Memoir on the Geology and Fossil Remains of New Zealand,\r\nfrom the researches of Walter Mantell, Esq.--_Geol. Journal_, vol. vi.\r\n_pl._ 29.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean, of Clapham Common, informs me that a large quantity of white\r\nearth sent from New Zealand as native magnesia, he found to consist\r\nwholly of frustules of diatomaceæ, chiefly of _Galionellæ_. (See _Lign.\r\n5._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 5.\r\n\r\nFossil. Galiomellæ; _highly magnified_.]\r\n\r\nIn America, recent beds of this kind of great extent have been observed\r\nand examined by that distinguished microscopist, Dr. Bailey, Professor\r\nof Chemistry in the Military Academy at West Point: and the pages of\r\nthat excellent scientific periodical, Silliman's _American Journal of\r\nScience_, are enriched with figures and descriptions of the microphytes\r\nof which they are mainly composed.\r\n\r\nBut the Tertiary formations contain strata of this nature, which far\r\nsurpass in the abundance and variety of their organic contents, any\r\nof the modern deposits we have noticed. The _Polierschiefer_, or\r\n_polishing-slate_ of Bilin, is stated, by M. Ehrenberg, to form a\r\nseries of strata fourteen feet in thickness, entirely made up of the\r\nsiliceous shells of _Galionellæ_, of such extreme minuteness, that\r\na cubic inch of the stone contains forty-one thousand millions. The\r\n_Berghmehl_ (_mountain-meal_, or _fossil farina_), of San Flora, in\r\nTuscany, is one mass of these organisms.\r\n\r\nIn Lapland a similar earth is met with, which, in times of scarcity, is\r\nmixed by the inhabitants with the ground bark of trees, for food; some\r\nof this earth was found to contain twenty different species of algæ.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Soos, near Egra, in Bohemia, a fine white infusorial\r\nearth occurs, about three feet beneath the surface; this substance,\r\nwhen dried, appears to the naked eve like pure magnesia, but under the\r\nmicroscope is seen to be mainly constituted of elegant disciform cases\r\nof a species of _Campilodiscus_, of which figures are given, _Lign.\r\n111, figs. 1, 2_.\r\n\r\nSome beds of porcelain-earth M. Ehrenberg found to be in a great\r\nmeasure made up of concentric articulated rings, entire and in\r\nfragments (see _Lign. 6_), which he believes to be bacillariæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 6 Organic Bodies in Porcelain Earth; _highly\r\nmagnified_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DIATOMACEÆ OF VIRGINIA.]\r\n\r\nFossil Diatomaceæ of the Richmond-earth; Virginia.--The town of\r\nRichmond, in Virginia, is built on strata of siliceous marl of great\r\nextent, which earth; highly magnified. have a total thickness, beneath\r\nand around the town, of more than twenty feet. These marls, whose\r\norganic composition was first detected by Professor W. B. Rogers, are\r\nreferred by that eminent American geologist, to the older tertiary\r\n(_eocene_, or _miocene_) formations. They occupy considerable\r\ndistricts, spreading out into sterile tracts along the flanks of\r\nthe hills, their siliceous character rendering them unfavourable to\r\nvegetation. The investigations of Dr. Bailey have shown that the\r\nfrustules so abundant in this earth, consist of several species of\r\nNavicula (_Lign. 1, fig. 1, 1a_.), Galionella (_Lign. 1. fig. 3,\r\n3a_.), _Actinocyclus_ (_Lign. 1, figs. 4, 5_), &c.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable forms are disciform frustules, having their\r\nsurfaces elaborately ornamented with hexagonal spots disposed in\r\ncurves, and bearing some resemblance to the engine-turned case of a\r\nwatch. _Lign. 7, fig. 2_, is a small segment of a disc, very highly\r\nmagnified. These frustules vary in size from 1/100 to 1/1000 of an inch\r\nin diameter; they are named _Coscinodiscus_ (_sieve-like disc_), and\r\nthere are several species: one less richly sculptured, _C. patina_, is\r\nfigured _Lign. 7, fig. 6_. Circular bodies, with five or six lines\r\nradiating from the centre to the circumference, like the spokes of\r\na wheel, hence named _Actinocyclus_ (_Lign. 7, figs. 4, 5_), and\r\nspicules of Sponges, are also abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 7. Microphytes[69] from the Richmond-earth;\r\n_highly magnified_.\r\n\r\n_Tertiary. Virginia._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Navicula. 1_a_.

Lateral view.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[69] As the term _Infusorial-earth_ must be abandoned, it will be\r\nconvenient to substitute a name simply expressive of the nature of\r\nthe most abundant organisms that enter into the composition of these\r\ndeposits: that of _Microphyta_, or _Microphytes_, (from μικρος,\r\n_mikros_, small, and φυτον, _phyton_, a plant), signifying very\r\nminute vegetables, may perhaps be admissible: in this sense the word\r\nmicrophytal is employed in these pages.\r\n\r\nWhen a few grains of the marl are prepared, and mounted on a glass,\r\nalmost all these varieties will be manifest, so largely is this earth\r\ncomposed of organic structures; in fact, very few inorganic particles\r\nare intermixed, the merest pellicle left by the evaporation of a drop\r\nof water in which some of the marl has been mixed, teeming with the\r\nmost beautiful structures.\r\n\r\nAt Petersburg, in Virginia, a sandy marl occurs, interstratified with\r\ndeposits which, from their shells, are referred to the older tertiary\r\nformations. Probably this marl is a continuation of that of Richmond,\r\nbut it is full of many new forms, associated with those common in the\r\nearth of the latter locality.[70]\r\n\r\n[70] Dr. Bailey, with great liberality, has so amply supplied myself\r\nand other observers with specimens of these deposits for examination,\r\nthat the fossils above described are familiar to all British\r\nmicroscopists. Figures of many of those organisms are given in the\r\nAmerican Journal of Science.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, (first observed by Mr. Hamlin Lee,) that the\r\ncommon Scallop (_Pecten maximus_), as well as the Barnacle (_Balanus_),\r\nfeed on diatomaceæ, and their stomachs generally contain numerous cases\r\nof Coscinodisci, Dichtyochi, Actinocycli, &c.: a slide prepared and\r\nmounted with the contents of the stomachs of these mollusks, presents\r\nan assemblage of forms identical with those found in the tertiary\r\nearths of Virginia.[71]\r\n\r\n[71] See my \"Thoughts on Animalcules,\" p. 103.\r\n\r\nIn the mud of the quicksands on the shore at Brighton, Mr. Reginald\r\nMantell found recent Coscinodisci, &c. associated with fossil\r\npolythalamia that had been washed out of the chalk, and precipitated\r\nwith the frustules of the recent diatomaceæ, into the sediments now in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of marine and fresh-water forms in the same deposit\r\nis not unusual; and the remarks of Dr. Bailey on this fact are so\r\npertinent, that I insert them, as a salutary caution against hasty\r\ngeneralizations on subjects connected with these investigations.\r\nAfter describing a species of Galionella (_G. moniliformis_), as an\r\ninhabitant only of salt and brackish water, and stating that he had\r\nalso found it sixty miles up the Hudson River, near West Point, Dr.\r\nBailey observes--\"The Fauna and Flora of the Hudson at this place\r\nwould, if in a fossil state, be rather puzzling to the geologist, on\r\naccount of the singular mixture of marine and fluviatile species. While\r\n_Valisneria_ and _Potamogeton_ (two common fresh-water plants), grow\r\nin such vast quantities, in some places, as to prevent the passage\r\nof a boat, and the shore is strewn with fluviatile shells (such as\r\nPlanorbis, Physa, &c.) in a living state, yet the above plants are\r\nentangled with Algæ (sea-weeds), and marine parasitic zoophytes; while\r\nthe rocks below low-water mark are covered with Balani (_barnacles_)\r\nand minute corallines, and the marine Flora is represented by vast\r\nquantities of very elegant sea plants.\"[72]\r\n\r\n[72] American Journal of Science, vol. x. p. 41.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must here close this extended notice of the fossil remains of a class\r\nof vegetable organisms, which, though for the most part invisible\r\nto the unassisted eye as individual forms, constitute by their\r\ninconceivable multitudes an important element in the formation of\r\nsedimentary deposits. The fact of their having been formerly treated\r\nof as animalcules, and generally regarded as belonging to the animal\r\nkingdom, rendered a full consideration of the phenomena necessary,\r\nin order to place the subject before the reader in a clear and\r\ncomprehensive point of view.[73]\r\n\r\n[73] As both the recent and fossil frustules of Diatomaceæ are\r\nbeautiful objects for the microscope and polariscope, they are in much\r\nrequest. Specimens mounted on glass slides may be had of Mr. Topping,\r\nand Mr. Poulton. See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfervites.--The cellular aquatic plants named Confervæ are sometimes\r\nfound in transparent quartz pebbles, and in chalk, appearing as\r\ndelicate simple or branched filaments, which, by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope, are seen to be articulated. Seven species are described\r\nby authors, but the vegetable nature of some of these is doubtful. A\r\nbeautiful species in Chalk, first noticed by the late Samuel Woodward,\r\nEsq. (author of the Geology of Norfolk), is here figured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 8. Confervites Woodwardii; _nat._\r\n\r\n_Chalk. Norfolk._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FUCOIDS.]\r\n\r\nFossil Fucoids.--Of the tribe of Algæ which comprises the sea-weeds\r\nthat are not articulated, many fossil species occur in very ancient,\r\nas well as in modern, fossiliferous deposits. In the Lower Silurian\r\nrocks of North America, beds of limestone of great extent are full of\r\na large digitated Fucus (_Fucoides Alleghaniensis_).[74] The Firestone\r\nor Malm-rock of Bignor in Sussex abounds in a ramose variety (_Fucoides\r\nTargionii_, _Vég. Foss._ p. 56), of which specimens are figured in the\r\nvignette of this volume, and in _Lign. 9._\r\n\r\n[74] Figured and described in Dr. Harlan's Medical and Physical\r\nResearches: Philadelphia, 1835, p. 393.\r\n\r\n\r\nChondrites.--These fossil algæ approach nearest to the living species\r\nof _Chondrus_ (hence the name of the genus). The frond is thick,\r\nbranched, dichotomous, with cylindrical or claviform divisions, with\r\na smooth surface and without tubercles. The substance of the Bignor\r\nfossils is a white friable earth, which strikingly contrasts with\r\nthe dark grey malm-rock that forms the matrix. As the Sussex Chalk\r\nChondrites appear to be distinct from the Tertiary species named by M.\r\nBrongniart _C. Targionii_, I have, at the suggestion of Mr. Morris,\r\nsubstituted _C. Bignoriensis_, to indicate the locality in Sussex in\r\nwhich I discovered it forty years since. In the chalk-flints ramose\r\nfuci occasionally occur, but not in a state of preservation that admits\r\nof the determination of the forms of the originals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 9.\r\n\r\nChondrites Bignoriensis; _nat._\r\n\r\n_Malm-rock. Bignor, Sussex._]\r\n\r\nThe tertiary marls and limestones of Monte Bolca yield several\r\nbeautiful species of Algæ, one of which is figured in _Lign. 10_. It is\r\nreferred to the fossil genus _Delesserites_ (Sternberg), which includes\r\nthose algæ that have thin, and flat or undulated, smooth, membranous\r\nfronds, with a median rib.\r\n\r\nOf the little plants comprised in the class of cellular cryptogamia,\r\nwhich have stems, leaves, and fructification, but no true vessels, two\r\nor three species of Moss and Liverwort have been met with in tertiary\r\nstrata. Mosses as well as Fuci are occasionally imbedded in quartz\r\npebbles, in which they appear of their natural colour, and apparently\r\nfloating in the transparent medium. A beautiful green moss, with a\r\nConferva twined round its base, is figured _Lign. 11_ , p. 104, from a\r\nspecimen described by the late Dr. Macculloch. It is supposed to be\r\nrelated to _Hypnum_ (_Geol. Trans._ vol. ii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOCHA-STONES.]\r\n\r\nMoss-agates and Mocha-stones.--The beautiful siliceous pebbles called\r\nMoss-agates, and Mocha-stones, will so often come under the notice\r\nof the collector, that, although but extremely few, if any, of these\r\nobjects contain organic remains, the arborescent substances they\r\ninclose being merely metallic oxides, a few remarks on their nature\r\nmay be expected. The late Dr. Macculloch paid considerable attention\r\nto the investigation of these bodies, and believed that some of\r\nthe objects imbedded in the pure and compact quartz were really of\r\nvegetable or animal origin; the specimen figured _Lign. 11_ is of this\r\nkind; the fossils being apparently cellular cryptogamous plants. In\r\n_Geol. Trans_, vol. ii., other examples are figured and described by\r\nthe same sagacious observer. Mr. Bowerbank is of opinion that spongeous\r\nstructure enters into the composition of almost all the moss-agates,\r\nand I have no doubt that in some instances such organisms are present:\r\nbut in by far the greater number of agates and mocha-stones the\r\ninclosed bodies are mere crystallizations; they are arborescent or\r\ndendritical oxides of manganese, copper, chlorite, iron, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 10 Delesserites (Fucoides) Lamourouxii.\r\n\r\n_Monte Bolca._ (_Vég.

Brongniart, who carefully examined a great number of agates and\r\npebbles, with the view of determining if vegetable substances were\r\never imbedded in them, could not detect a single instance in which\r\nthe apparent mosses, confervæ, or algæ, were organic; in every case\r\nthe mineral origin of the pseudo-vegetation was, in his opinion,\r\nunequivocal. Some of the beautiful green arborescent bodies in quartz\r\npebbles, even under the microscope, present so close a resemblance to\r\nconfervæ and mosses, that it is difficult to persuade oneself they are\r\nnot vegetable structures; but the observations of M. Brongniart appear\r\nto me conclusive as to their mineral nature.[75] With the exception of\r\nthree or four species of _Jungermannia_, and four or five of _Muscites_\r\nin Amber, M. Brongniart states that he knows but one true fossil plant\r\nof the family of Mosses; the _Muscites Tournalii_ from the fresh-water\r\ntertiary deposits of Armissan.\r\n\r\n[75] See Histoire des Végétaux Fossiles, pp. 29-34.\r\n\r\n\r\nVascular, or Acrogenous Cryptogamia.--These plants, as the name\r\nimplies, possess a more complicated structure than the preceding,\r\nhaving vascular tissue as varied as in the phanerogamia.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquisetaceæ.--The common species of Equisetum, or Marestail, is a plant\r\nthat grows in marshy tracts, and on the banks of ditches and rivers; it\r\nhas a jointed stalk, garnished with elegant sheaths which embrace the\r\nstem, and verticillate linear leaves: it attains a height of two feet,\r\nand is half an inch in diameter. In the fossil state there are many\r\nplants allied to the Equisetum, but only a few that are generically the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 12. Equisetum Lyellii.\r\n\r\n_Wealden.

This plant occurs in many\r\nlocalities of the Wealden in Sussex and Kent; from the railway cuttings\r\nnear Tonbridge, I collected several fine specimens; it is met with also\r\nin the cliffs near Hastings.\r\n\r\nEquisetites columnaris. _Lign. 13_.--A gigantic species of Equisetum\r\nabounds in the strata of the lower division of the Oolitic or Jurassic\r\nformation of Yorkshire, and many fine specimens have been collected,\r\nespecially from the vicinity of Whitby. In the sandstone of the\r\nInferior Oolite of the Cleveland Hills, Yorkshire, numerous stems\r\nof this colossal marestail have been observed standing erect, as if\r\noccupying the position in which they grew; the same fact was also\r\ndiscovered at Carlton Bank, near Stokesly, forty miles from the coast.\r\nIn both localities fossil shells of fresh-water mussels (_Uniones_)\r\nwere associated with the vegetable remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 13.

The sheaths surrounding\r\nthe stem, and the verticillate linear leaves, are preserved in some\r\nexamples: and in all, the furrows left by the imprints of the sheaths\r\nare more or less strongly impressed. The stem is not channelled\r\nthroughout, as in _Calamites_, the carboniferous plant whose stems at\r\nfirst sight might be mistaken for those of Equisetites, but which are\r\nentirely distinct, as will be explained hereafter. The Equisetites\r\ncolumnaris is peculiar to the Oolite; it does not occur in the\r\ncoal-measures. Specimens have been discovered which indicate a height\r\nof twenty feet, and a diameter of several inches.[76]\r\n\r\n[76] See Hist. Vég. Fossiles, p. 115.\r\n\r\nA small species of Equisetum (_Eq.

Some of the species are of a gigantic size, being from\r\none to three feet in diameter, and from thirty to forty feet in height.\r\nCalamites abound in the coal formation, and must have constituted an\r\nimportant feature in the forests of the carboniferous period; they\r\noccur also in more ancient deposits, and some species belong to the\r\nearliest terrestrial Flora of which any vestiges are known. In most\r\ninstances when specimens are found lying in the same plane with the\r\nstrata, they are pressed flat, but those occurring in a vertical\r\nposition retain their natural cylindrical form. An outer crust or\r\ncylinder of coal generally invests the stem, but traces of the internal\r\nstructure are rarely preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Calamite consists of a large central column of tissue, surrounded\r\nby a ligneous cylinder. The central part has in most instances perished\r\nafter the death of the plant, and the cavity thus left been filled\r\nup with mineral matter. As the hollow ligneous zone is almost always\r\ncarbonized, and very friable, it is seldom attached to the cast, and\r\nconsequently the surface of the latter is generally jointed and ribbed.\r\n\r\nThe true external surface of the cortical investment is marked with\r\nlongitudinal striæ, without any indications of joints or constrictions;\r\nbut the position of the original articulations is indicated in some\r\nspecimens by the _presence of small verticillate scars, to which leaves\r\nwere appended_[78] as in the example figured by M. Brongniart, of which\r\n_Lign. 14, fig. 1_, is a reduced figure.\r\n\r\n[78] See Mr. Dawes, \"On the Structure of Calamites,\" Proc. Geol.

This specimen points out\r\nthe importance of carefully examining and preserving the stone around\r\nfossil stems; had this precaution been lost sight of in this instance,\r\nno knowledge would have been obtained of this important botanical\r\ncharacter. It is rarely that any traces of the roots remain; the fossil\r\nfigured (_fig. 2_) is from the _Foss.

The most\r\nessential character of these vegetables, is that of developing their\r\nfructification on the leaves; a fact familiar to every one who has\r\neven but cursorily examined the Polypody growing on our walls, or the\r\nBrake of our hedge-rows and commons. The largest species of British\r\nferns scarcely exceed four or five feet in height; but the arborescent\r\nor tree-ferns, of warm climates, attain an altitude of from thirty to\r\nforty feet. There is too this peculiarity in the arborescent forms,\r\nthat while in our indigenous species the leaves surround the stem, and\r\nincline towards the upper part of the plant, the foliage of the former\r\nbends downwards, and spreads out from the crown, or summit, into an\r\nelegant canopy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 16.

The veins are introduced in the leaflets,\r\n          _d_; but in the lower ones, _e_, the midribs\r\n          only are marked.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe leaves of our branched ferns are persistent, and when shed, the\r\nmarkings left by their attachment to the stalk are soon obliterated. In\r\nthe arborescent ferns, on the contrary, the petioles become detached\r\nfrom their bases, and fall entire, leaving scars or cicatrices on\r\nthe stem; and these impressions are so regularly and symmetrically\r\ndisposed, as to afford characters by which the trunks may be\r\ndistinguished from those of other trees. The stems of the tree-ferns\r\nare therefore easily recognized in a fossil state externally, by their\r\ncylindrical forms without ramification, and by the regular disposition\r\nand peculiar character of the scars left by the separation of the\r\npetioles; and, internally by that peculiar zone, formed of bundles\r\nof ligneous tissue inclosed in sheaths, which encircles the central\r\naxis, as shown in the transverse sections in _Lign. 2_, _ante_, p.\r\n62. The leaves may be identified by the form of their segments, which\r\nare disposed with remarkable regularity, and have a peculiar mode of\r\nsubdivision; and above all, by the delicacy, evenness, and distribution\r\nof the veins. There are upwards of two thousand species of living\r\nferns, and in the fossil kingdom the number is considerable; more than\r\ntwo hundred have been collected from the carboniferous formation. The\r\nrecent tree-ferns are confined almost exclusively to the equinoctial\r\nregions; humidity and heat being the conditions most favourable to\r\ntheir development (_Vég. Foss._ p. 141. _Bd._ p. 461. _Wond._ p. 727).\r\n\r\nFrom the elegance and diversity of form of their foliage, fossil ferns\r\nare the most remarkable and attractive vegetable remains in the ancient\r\nstrata. The greater number are from the coal deposits, the fern-leaves\r\ngenerally occurring in the schists or shales that form the roof of the\r\nbeds of coal. Many of the strata are made up of carbonized fern-leaves\r\nand stems closely pressed together. The roof of a coal-mine, when\r\nnewly exposed, often presents a most interesting appearance, from the\r\nabundance and variety of leaves, branches, and stems, that occur either\r\nin relief, or impressed on the dark glossy surface. The specimens\r\nselected for illustration exhibit the principal modes of venation on\r\nwhich the genera are founded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fossil genera have been established by M. Ad. Brongniart, from\r\nthe form of the leaves and the characters of their venation; that is,\r\nthe distribution of the vessels. In the following descriptions some\r\nbotanical phrases are necessarily employed; a few terms of frequent\r\noccurrence are explained in _Lign. 16_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPachypteris[81] (_thick-fern_). _Lign. 17._--In this genus from the\r\nlower Oolite, the fronds are pinnated, or bipinnated, the leaflets\r\nentire, without visible veins, having but a single midrib, and\r\ncontracted at the base. The absence of veins, and the leaflets not\r\nbeing lobed, are the essential generic distinctions.\r\n\r\n[81] The names of the genera are derived from _pteris_, fern, to which\r\nprefixed a term indicative of the peculiar characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 17. Pachypteris lanceolata.\r\n\r\n_Inferior Oolite. Whitby._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 18. Sphenopteris elegans\r\n\r\n_Coal-shale, Waldenburg, Silesia._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FERNS.

A beautiful Sphenopteris (_S. affinis_, _Wond._ p. 716,)\r\noccurs abundantly in the fresh-water carboniferous strata at Burdie\r\nHouse, near Edinburgh;[82] another elegant form, in coal-shale, is\r\nrepresented in _Lign. 18_.\r\n\r\n[82] See Dr. Hibbert's Memoir on the Strata and Fossils of Burdie\r\nHouse. 4to. 1835.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 19.

J. F. Bunbury, Esq.[83]\r\n\r\n[83] Geol. Journal, vol. vii. p. 179, pl. xii.\r\n\r\nThis fossil fern closely resembles certain species of _Dicksonia_\r\n(natives of New Granada). Each segment of the leaflet or pinnate\r\nis dilated at the apex into a reniform _indusium_; no capsules are\r\nvisible, the fructification being, probably, in a young state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 20. Sphenopteris Mantelli; _nat._ _Wealden,\r\nTilgate Forest._]\r\n\r\nIn the Wealden deposits, both of England and Germany, several species\r\nof Sphenopteris abound; one of which (_Foss. Tilg.

This species\r\nis characterized by its slender and minutely divided wedge-shaped\r\nleaflets. The Sphenopteris Mantelli did not attain a considerable size;\r\nthe largest stem I have seen indicated a plant of five or six feet in\r\nheight. This Sphenopteris is sometimes associated with the remains of a\r\nbeautiful plant of the genus _Alethoptris_,[84] the leaflets of which,\r\nin some examples, bear the fructification.

The form and\r\ndisposition of the veins resemble those of some living species of fern;\r\nthe absence of a median rib, or vein, is the most striking character\r\nof this genus.

Graves found the same fern near Beauvais in France,\r\nin strata, which, from the presence of the fresh-water limestone called\r\nSussex marble, are supposed to be referable to the Wealden epoch. This\r\nLonchopteris is widely spread through the Wealden; and occurs also in\r\nthe Greensand. Mr. Morris first observed it in the iron-sandstone of\r\nShanklin Chine.[86]\r\n\r\n[86] Geol.

The fructification is punctiform, and placed at the\r\napices of the veins.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of these remarkable ferns has been mistaken for the leaves\r\nof dicotyledonous plants; but M. Brongniart has demonstrated that they\r\nbelong to the present family. Six species have been found in the Oolite\r\nand Lias.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 30.

CLATHROPTERIS.]\r\n\r\nClathropteris (_latticed-leaf_). _Lign. 30._--Leaf deeply pinnatifid;\r\nleaflets elongated, traversed by a strong midrib extending to the apex;\r\nsecondary veins numerous, simple, parallel, almost perpendicular to the\r\nmidrib, united by transverse branches, which, with the finer veins,\r\nproduce on the surface of the leaf a net-work of quadrangular meshes.\r\n\r\nThis genus was instituted by M. Brongniart, for the reception of\r\nsome very large fern-leaves from the shale of Hoer, in Scania,\r\nwhich resemble in structure the foliage of the recent _Polypodium\r\nquercifolium_, a native of the East Indies, and the Moluccas. One leaf\r\nwas four feet wide, and the leaflets, though imperfect, were eighteen\r\ninches long.[88]\r\n\r\n[88] Hoer is a little village, situated nearly in the centre of\r\nScania, a province in the southern extremity of Sweden. The Chalk\r\nformation appears in several parts of this district, and Carboniferous\r\nstrata at Hoeganes. To the west of Hoer, there is a range of hills,\r\ncomposed of ferruginous grits, micaceous sandstones, clays, and beds\r\nof quartzose conglomerate. It is in these strata that the ferns and\r\nother terrestrial plants occur, and no animal remains whatever have\r\nbeen found in them; their geological position appears to be between\r\nthe Chalk and the Coal, but on this point nothing positive is known.\r\nThe general analogy of the plants with the group forming the Flora\r\nof the Wealden, led M. Brongniart to suppose that the deposits in\r\nquestion belong to that formation; and M. Nillson, of Lund, who\r\nexamined my collection at Brighton, recognized, among some undescribed\r\nplants from Tilgate Forest, forms that he had collected from Hoer. See\r\n\"_Observations sur les Végétaux Fossiles renfermés dans les Grès de\r\nHoer en Scanie: par M. Ad. Brongniart._\" _Ann. Sc. Nat._ 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany other genera of fossil ferns have been established from the form\r\nand venation of the leaves, and are described in _Brit. Foss. Flor._,\r\nand other British and foreign works.\r\n\r\n\r\nStems of arborescent Ferns.--Notwithstanding the profusion with which\r\nthe foliage of many kinds of ferns is distributed throughout the coal\r\nformation, the undoubted stems of plants of this family are rarely\r\nmet with; for the numerous tribe called Sigillariæ is now removed\r\naltogether from this class. It may, however, admit of question whether\r\nmuch of the foliage which, from the analogy of structure, has been\r\nreferred to ferns, may not have belonged to those trees; for as in the\r\nanimal kingdom, so in the vegetable, distinct types of living organisms\r\nare often found blended in the lost races; and as the stems of recent\r\ntree-ferns are even more durable than their leaves, it seems impossible\r\nto account for their absence in strata, that inclose entire layers of\r\nthe foliage matted together. A few fossils, supposed to possess the\r\nessential characters of recent fern-stems, have been discovered, and\r\narranged under the following genus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FERN-STEMS.]\r\n\r\nCaulopteris (_fern-stem_). _Lign. 31._--Stems not channelled, marked\r\nwith discoidal, oblong, or ovate scars, arranged longitudinally;\r\nvascular cicatrices numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 31. Caulopteris macrodiscus. _Coal._]\r\n\r\nThe fragment of stem here figured, resembles the trunks of some recent\r\ntree-ferns in its proportions, and in the number, disposition, and\r\nsize, of the scars of the leaf-stalks; but these markings differ in\r\ntheir more lanceolate form, and pointed terminations, and in their\r\npeculiarly striated surface, from those of any known existing species.\r\n\r\nPsarolites (_Silicified Fern-Stems_).--In the New Red sandstone, near\r\nHillersdorf, in the neighbourhood of Chemnitz, in Saxony, silicified\r\nstems, apparently of tree-ferns, occur in great numbers. They are\r\nremarkably beautiful, and the organization of the original is so well\r\npreserved by the silex, that slices, examined by the microscope,\r\ndisplay the peculiar structure almost as perfectly as if the plants\r\nwere recent: transverse sections exhibit the arched bundles of vascular\r\nfibres which compose the ligneous cylinder, surrounded by the cellular\r\ntissue. From the stellated markings produced by sections of the vessels\r\nthat compose the tissues, and which are visible to the naked eye,\r\nthese fossils have obtained the popular name of _Staaren-stein_, or\r\nStar-stone. The external surface of the specimens I have examined has a\r\nligneous structure, and is of a dark reddish brown colour; internally\r\nthe stems are of a dull red, mottled with various tints of blue and\r\nyellow, from the infiltrated chalcedony with which the vessels are\r\npermeated.[89]\r\n\r\n[89] See Pict. Atlas (pl. viii.) for coloured figures; and Org. Rem.\r\nvol. L plate viii. _figs._ 1-7. The reader will be amused by the\r\nperusal of the ingenious but unsuccessful attempt of the excellent\r\nauthor, Mr. Parkinson, to elucidate their nature. I have still a\r\nspecimen which he presented to me more than thirty-five years since, as\r\none of the most curious and perplexing fossils that had ever come under\r\nhis notice.\r\n\r\nAn excellent work (\"_Dendrolithen_\") on these fossils, in which thirty\r\nspecies are described, has been published at Dresden by M. Cotta; who\r\narranges them under the genus _Psaronius_ or _Psarolites_. The stem is\r\ncomposed of two distinct parts; an outer zone, consisting of a great\r\nnumber of nearly cylindrical bundles of vessels, supposed to have been\r\nroots which proceeded from the stem near its base; and an inner part\r\nor axis. In the outer portion, the fossil _air-roots_ have a vascular\r\ntissue, but there is often a delicate cellular tissue interposed. In\r\nthe axis the vessels form zigzag or wavy bands, resembling those of\r\nferns.[90] These flexuous and vermiform bands are entirely composed\r\nof barred or scalariform vessels, similar to those of ferns and\r\nclub-mosses. The Psarolites are therefore considered by M. Ad.\r\nBrongniart to be the bases of the trunks of lycopodiaceous trees, while\r\nM. Cotta and other botanists regard them as true arborescent ferns.[91]\r\n\r\n[90] Pict. Atlas, pl. viii.\r\n\r\n[91] See M. Brongniart's \"_Tableau des Genres de Végét. Foss._\" p. 44.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland has discovered in the New Bed sandstone formation at\r\nAllesley, near Coventry, silicified trunks of coniferous trees, and it\r\nis not improbable that further research in that locality may bring to\r\nlight fern-stems like those of Chemnitz.[92] Dr. Lloyd, of Warwick, has\r\nrecently obtained leaves of several coniferæ from the same locality.[93]\r\n\r\n[92] Vide Geol. Proc. vol. ii. p. 438.\r\n\r\n[93] Geol. Society, June 1852. Dr. Lloyd's specimens are probably\r\nreferable to the genus _Walchia_: see _Lign. 60._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIGILLARLÆ AND STIGMARIÆ.]\r\n\r\nSigillarlæ and Stigmariæ.\r\n\r\nAmong the most common and striking objects that arrest the attention\r\nof a person who visits a coal-mine for the first time, and examines\r\nthe numerous vegetable relics that are profusely dispersed among the\r\nheaps of slate, coal, and shale, are long flat slabs, from half an\r\ninch to an inch thick, having both surfaces longitudinally fluted, and\r\nuniformly pitted with deep symmetrical imprints; these are disposed\r\nwith such perfect regularity between the grooves, that the specimens\r\nare often supposed, by persons not conversant with palæontology, to be\r\nengraven stones, and not natural productions. These fossils are the\r\nflattened trunks of gigantic trees covered by the bark in the state of\r\ncoal; the regular imprints on the surface, being the scars left by the\r\nseparation of the petioles or leaf-stalks, as in the arborescent ferns\r\npreviously examined. The name _Sigillaria_, commonly applied to these\r\nfossils, is derived from _sigillum_, a seal, and alludes to the regular\r\nand uniform pattern of the imprints on the surface. These stems are\r\nfrom a few inches to several feet in diameter, and the largest attain\r\na height of sixty feet; they are generally found lying in a horizontal\r\nposition in the strata, and quite flat, from the pressure produced by\r\nthe superincumbent rocks; but when the trunks are in an erect position,\r\nand at right angles to the plane of the beds, the cylindrical form of\r\nthe original is preserved.\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance, in which five stems of Sigillaria were standing\r\nupright, with their roots in the soil below, apparently in the position\r\nin which they grew, was brought to light a few years since, in forming\r\nthe Bolton and Manchester railway.[94] They stand on the same plane,\r\nand near to each other. Their roots are branched, and spread out in\r\nthe bed of impure coal in which they are implanted. The trunks are\r\nsurrounded by a soft blue shale. The largest tree is eleven feet high,\r\nand seven and a half feet in circumference at the base; its trunk\r\nis gnarled and knotted, and has many decorticated prominences, like\r\nthose in barked timber of our old dicotyledonous trees; the roots,\r\ntoo, partake of the same character.[95] The others are respectively\r\nfrom three to five feet in height. A sketch of one of the short stems\r\nis subjoined. All the trees were broken off as if by violence, and no\r\ntraces of the upper part of the stems or branches were detected.\r\n\r\n[94] These trees still remain _in situ_, and, thanks to the scientific\r\nzeal of Mr. Hawkshaw, have been carefully preserved. They are situated\r\nat Dixon Fold, Clifton, near Manchester. Instructive models of these\r\nhighly interesting relics of the carboniferous forests may be obtained.\r\n\r\nAn excellent Memoir on this discovery, with illustrations, by Mr.\r\nHawkshaw, is given in Geol. Trans, vol. vi. pl. xvii. See Pict. Atlas,\r\np. 198; and Petrifactions, p. 36.\r\n\r\n[95] See Mr. Bowman's Memoir, Geol. Proc. vol. iii. p. 270.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 32. Base of a Trunk of a Sigillaria. with roots,\r\n_standing erect with five other stems, in Carboniferous strata_.\r\n\r\n(_The original is four feet high._)]\r\n\r\nIn the stratum through which the roots extend, a considerable quantity\r\nof the fossil cones, called _Lepidostrobi_, hereafter described, were\r\nimbedded (see _Lign. 40_). A thin layer of coal which invested the\r\nstems, was evidently the carbonized bark. All the stems were filled\r\nwith blue clay, or shale, a proof that they were hollow when submerged\r\nin the mud, which is now consolidated into the shale in which they are\r\nimbedded. But it is not probable that they were originally tubular,\r\nlike a reed: on the contrary, there is evidence to show that they\r\nwere highly organized. Their internal structure may have decayed, or\r\nbeen destroyed by insects or other depredators; as is often the case\r\nin tropical climates, where the trunks of timber trees are speedily\r\nexcavated after their fall, and afford shelter to innumerable insects\r\nand reptiles, as the weary traveller often finds to his surprise and\r\nannoyance.[96] The late Mr. Bowman affirmed[97] that these trees were\r\ndicotyledonous, and stated that medullary rays and coniferous structure\r\ncould be detected; an opinion, which the researches of M. Brongniart on\r\nthe Sigillariæ have fully corroborated.\r\n\r\n[96] Mr. Hawkshaw, Geol. Proc. p. 269.\r\n\r\n[97] Geol.

In forming the railway tunnel at Claycross,\r\nfive miles south of Chesterfield, through the middle portion of the\r\nDerbyshire coal-measures, in 1838, a group of nearly forty trees\r\n(_Sigillariæ_) was discovered, standing not more than three or four\r\nfeet apart, at right angles to the plane of the strata.[98] On the\r\ncoast of Northumberland, within the length of half a mile, twenty trees\r\nwere observed by Mr. Trevelyan, in 1816 (_Bd._ p. 470). The coal-pit at\r\nSt. Etienne, in France, described by M. Alex. Brongniart, is celebrated\r\nfor affording an example of this phenomenon (_Wond._ p. 673); but the\r\npositions of many of those stems are inclined at various angles, and\r\ntheir roots implanted in different beds, so that the perpendicularity\r\nof the erect trees is probably accidental (_Bd._ p. 471).\r\n\r\n[98] Ibid. p. 272.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable instance hitherto observed, is on the southern\r\nshore of the Bay of Fundy, in Nova Scotia, where the cliffs, which are\r\nabout two hundred feet high, are composed of carboniferous strata,\r\nconsisting of coal, clay, grit, and shale, in which numerous erect\r\ntrees, probably Sigillariæ, are seen on the face of the cliff; there\r\nare ten rows one above another, indicating, in the opinion of Sir C.\r\nLyell, repeated subsidences of the land, so as to allow of the growth\r\noften successive forests![99] (_Wond._ p. 674).\r\n\r\n[99] \"On the Coal Strata of Nova Scotia.\" Amer.

A specimen measured by M. Brongniart was\r\nforty feet long, one foot in diameter at the base, and but six inches\r\nat the top, where it divided into two equal branches. These stems may\r\nbe readily distinguished from those of other trees with which they are\r\nassociated, by the fluted surface produced by the deep longitudinal\r\ngrooves, and the regularly disposed imprints between the channels.[100]\r\nThe carbonized bark, in large specimens, is often an inch thick, but\r\nin small examples is a mere pellicle, and being extremely brittle,\r\nflakes off with the slightest touch, leaving the inner surface exposed,\r\nwith the coal remaining in the deep furrows and pits, as in _Lign.\r\n33, fig. 1_. No traces of leaves, or fruit, in connexion with the\r\nstems, have been observed. The subjoined sketches (_Lign._ 33, and 34,)\r\nillustrate the usual aspect of these fossils. The difference between\r\nthe imprints on the outside of the bark, and those on the exposed\r\nsurface of the stem, from the removal of the cortical covering, is well\r\nmarked in _Lign. 34_.\r\n\r\n[100] The stems of some recent dicotyledonous trees from New Zealand, in\r\nthe possession of Dr. Robert Brown, possess similar longitudinal ribs\r\nand furrows, both on the bark and alburnum, or naked wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 34.

It has been described and illustrated by that\r\neminent botanist, in a memoir which is one of the most valuable\r\ncontributions to fossil botany that has hitherto appeared.[101]\r\n\r\n[101] The reader intending to make fossil botany his particular study,\r\nshould refer to the original memoir, and become familiar with the\r\nfacts and inferences so admirably enunciated by the author; not only\r\nfor the illustration of the structure of the tribe of plants under\r\nconsideration, but as a valuable exemplification of the manner in\r\nwhich all such inquiries should be conducted.

The student should observe, that when mineral matter has\r\npermeated the stems of plants, the vascular tissue is often so well\r\npreserved, that one such specimen affords more important information,\r\nthan hundreds of examples in which the form alone remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIGILLARLA ELEGANS.]\r\n\r\nThe external surface of this specimen possesses the characteristic\r\nmarkings of the insertion of the leaf-stalks of _Sigillaria elegans_.\r\nThe internal organization, as seen in the transverse section, is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_a._ The centre, filled with silex; it exhibits no traces of structure.\r\n\r\n_b._ The zone which surrounds the interspace on which this letter is\r\nplaced, is composed of bundles of vascular tissue. A portion of one of\r\nthese bundles, highly magnified, is represented in _Plate V. fig. 7_.\r\n\r\nThe _inner_ circle of this zone, indicated by the _convex undulating\r\nline_, is made up of medullary vascular tissue; the external circle\r\nis divided by rays, and is composed of woody fibre, constituting a\r\nligneous cylinder. One of the spiral vessels (_fig. 3_), and another\r\nshowing a remarkable difference of structure in a short space (_fig._\r\n2), as seen in a longitudinal section of the medullary tissue, are\r\nfigured in _Lign. 35_.\r\n\r\nThe ligneous cylinder is surrounded by a band of cellular tissue, and\r\nthe space between this and the cortical integument is occupied by\r\nsilex, in which there are but obscure traces of structure.\r\n\r\nThe inner layer of bark, _f_, is composed of elongated cells, disposed\r\nin a radiating manner, and traversed by fibro-vascular bundles, which\r\npass towards the leaves.\r\n\r\nUpon instituting a comparison between the fossil and the stems of those\r\nrecent plants which present the closest analogy to it, M. Brongniart\r\nwas led to conclude that the Sigillariæ constituted a peculiar extinct\r\nfamily, belonging to the great division of gymnospermous dicotyledons.\r\n\r\nThe Sigillariæ were tall erect trees, with a regular and cylindrical\r\nstem, without side branches, but dichotomous towards the summit. Their\r\nsuperficial bark was hard and durable, channelled longitudinally,\r\nbearing leaf-scars that are of a rounded form above and below, and\r\nangular at the sides, often oblong in relation to the stem, and having\r\nthree vascular pits, one central and small, and two lateral of a\r\nlarger size. The internal structure bears most analogy to that of the\r\nCycadeæ, and the foliage consisted of long linear carinated leaves.\r\nThe Sigillariæ, therefore, differ essentially from the arborescent\r\ncryptogamia, which they somewhat approach in having scalariform\r\nvascular tissue, symmetrical and regular leaf-scars, and branchless\r\ntrunks. More than fifty species have been determined.[102]\r\n\r\n[102] For figures of Sigillariæ, see Pictorial Atlas, pl. xix. xx, xxiv.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STIGMARIA.]\r\n\r\nStigmaria. _Lign. 36._--This extended notice of the structure of the\r\nSigillariæ,.will enable us to understand the nature of the fossil\r\nvegetables termed Stigmariæ, or spotted-stems, which abound in the\r\nbeds of under-clay of most coal-fields, as stated in a former part\r\nof this work (_ante_, p. 81). These bodies when uncompressed are of\r\na cylindrical form, from one to six or seven inches in diameter,\r\nand of considerable length--sometimes upwards of twenty feet--and\r\ngradually diminish in size towards their termination. The surface is\r\nmarked with distinct pits or areolæ, of a circular or oval form, with\r\na small tubercle in the centre of each, disposed around the stem in\r\na quincunx and somewhat regular order. When broken transversely, a\r\nsmall cylindrical axis is seen to extend in a longitudinal direction\r\nthrough the stem, like a medullary column; it seldom occupies the\r\ncentre, but lies near to one side, and parallel with a depression on\r\nthe outer surface of the fossil. This internal body is often loose,\r\nand removable; its surface is covered with interrupted, irregular,\r\nlongitudinal, ridges, which leave corresponding depressions on the\r\nwalls of the cavity in which it was inclosed. _Lign. 36_, represents a\r\nfragment exhibiting the characters above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 36. Stigmaria ficoides.\r\n\r\n_Carboniferous.

Instances occur in which several Stigmariæ spring from\r\na common centre, of a dome-like form, whence they radiate in every\r\ndirection (_Bd._ pl. lvi. _fig._ 8), and the main branches divide and\r\nsubdivide till they are lost in the surrounding rock.\r\n\r\nThe nature of these fossil vegetables was long a perplexing question,\r\nfor no specimens had been found in connexion with any of the stems,\r\nbranches, or foliage, that abound in the coal deposits. At length,\r\nthe discovery of a dome-shaped mass, to which were attached numerous\r\nStigmariæ, seemed to afford a clue to the solution of this botanical\r\nproblem; and it was concluded by the eminent authors of the \"Fossil\r\nFlora of Great Britain,\" that the original belonged to a tribe of\r\nplants which inhabited swamps, or still and shallow lakes, and were\r\ncharacterized by a low truncated stem, having long horizontal branches\r\nbeset with cylindrical, and, probably, succulent leaves, that either\r\ntrailed on the surface of the swamp, or floated in the water.\r\n\r\nBut within the last few years, the occurrence in various carboniferous\r\ndeposits of erect stems of Sigillariæ, has shown that the Stigmariæ\r\nare nothing more than the roots of these and other congenerous trees;\r\nan opinion maintained by the Rev. H. Steinhaur more than thirty years\r\nago, and subsequently affirmed by M. Adolphe Brongniart, who found,\r\non examining microscopically the internal structure of a silicified\r\nspecimen in which the vascular tissue was preserved, that it bore as\r\nclose an analogy to that of the Sigillariæ, as exists between the roots\r\nand trunks of certain dicotyledonous trees.\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure, _Lign. 37_, represents the transverse section of a\r\nsmall Stigmaria, with the axis displaced from its natural situation;\r\nthis circumstance, as well as the corresponding external groove, has\r\narisen from compression, by which the tough cylinder has been forced\r\nfrom its original position in the middle of the soft cellular tissue,\r\nto one side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 37. Transverse Section of Stigmaria ficoides;\r\n_nat._\r\n\r\n(_M. Adolphe Brongniart._)\r\n\r\nThis specimen shows that the cylinder (_a_ in _Lign. 36_) is formed of\r\nbundles of vascular tissue, disposed in rays.]\r\n\r\nThe central axis is thus shown to be a cylinder composed of bundles of\r\nvessels, disposed in a radiating manner, and separated from each other\r\nby medullary rays; the whole constituting a ligneous zone resembling\r\nthat of Sigillaria (see _Lign. 35_); but the inner circle of medullary\r\ntissue seen in the latter is altogether wanting. This difference is\r\nsimilar to that observable in the stems or branches of a dicotyledonous\r\ntree, in which the woody cylinder is associated internally with\r\nbundles of medullary tissue, and the roots of the same tree that are\r\ndestitute of them. Part of a vascular bundle from the woody tissue of a\r\nStigmaria, seen by a high power and transmitted light, is figured _Pl.\r\nV. fig. 6_; the smooth interspaces are composed of cellular tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 38.

Brongniart was confirmed by the discovery, in 1843,\r\nat St. Helen's, near Liverpool, of an upright trunk of a Sigillaria,\r\nnine feet high, with ten roots eight or nine feet in length, still\r\nattached, and extending in their natural position. _These roots\r\nare undoubted Stigmariæ of the usual species, S. ficoides; and the\r\nradicles, formerly considered leaves, are spread out in all directions,\r\nto the extent of several feet._[103] To the sagacity and perseverance\r\nof Mr. Binney, of Manchester, science is indebted for this important\r\ndiscovery; the same gentleman laid bare, on the floor of the mine at\r\nDunkinfold, near Manchester, a large erect trunk of a Sigillaria, with\r\nnumerous Stigmariæ roots.\r\n\r\n[103] From a communication to the British Association at Cork, 1843.\r\n\r\nIn the Pictou coal-field of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia, similar facts\r\nhave been brought to light; the remarkable phenomena existing in that\r\nlocality, of successive carboniferous deposits containing scores of\r\nerect trees with roots spreading into their native soil, presenting\r\npeculiar facilities for verifying the observations made in England. In\r\nan interesting memoir on the coal-fields of Nova Scotia, Mr. Richard\r\nBrown has given a detailed account of numerous examples of stems of\r\nSigillariæ, and of Lepidodendra, (a tribe of gigantic club-mosses of\r\nwhich we shall presently treat,) with the roots attached; these roots,\r\nin every instance, had the characters and structure of Stigmariæ. In\r\none instance, the stem of the tree was broken off close to the roots,\r\nand the hollow cylinder of bark was bent down and doubled over by the\r\npressure of the surrounding mud, so as effectually to close up the\r\naperture, and leave only a few irregular cicatrices converging near the\r\napex; this fossil explains the true nature of the \"dome-shaped\" plant\r\nfigured in the Fossil Flora, and in Dr. Buckland's Essay.[CZ]\r\n\r\n[104] See Pictorial Atlas, p. 200: and Petrifactions, pp. 37, 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEPIDODENDRON.]\r\n\r\nLepidodendron (_scaly-tree_). _Lign. 39._--Stems cylindrical, covered\r\ntowards their extremities with simple, linear, or lanceolate leaves,\r\nwhich are attached to elevated rhomboidal spaces, or papillæ; papillæ\r\nmarked in the upper part with a large transverse triangular scar; lower\r\npart of the stem destitute of leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 39.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--A terminal Branch of a Lepidodendron; _nat._\r\n\r\n       2.--Leaf-scars on the stem of a Lepidodendron; _nat._\r\n\r\n_In Coal-shale, Newcastle._]\r\n\r\nThe remains of this tribe of plants abound in the coal formation, and\r\nrival in number and magnitude the Calamites and Sigillariæ previously\r\ndescribed. These trees have received the name of _Lepidodendra_, from\r\nthe scaly character of their stems, occasioned by the angular scars\r\nleft by the separation of the foliage, as is the case in arborescent\r\nferns: the term, however, simply indicates the appearance, for the\r\nsurface is not imbricated. Some of these trees have been found almost\r\nentire, from the roots to their topmost branches. One specimen, forty\r\nfeet high, and thirteen feet in diameter at the base, divided towards\r\nthe summit into fifteen or twenty branches, was discovered in the\r\nJarrow coal-mine.[105] The foliage consists of simple, linear leaves,\r\nspirally arranged around the stem, and appears to have been shed from\r\nthe base of the tree with age. The scars produced by the attachment of\r\nthe petioles were persistent; and the twigs and branches are generally\r\nfound covered with foliage, as in _Lign. 39_. The roots are Stigmariæ,\r\nlike those of the Sigillariæ, as proved by specimens in the Pictou\r\ncoal-field, discovered by Mr. Brown.[106]\r\n\r\n[105] Wond, p. 722. This specimen is figured and described in Foss. Flor.\r\n\r\n[106] Petrifactions, p. 39.\r\n\r\nThe internal organization of the stem of Lepidodendron differs from\r\nthat of Sigillaria, in the absence of the woody cylinder and medullary\r\nrays which constitute so peculiar and important a character in the\r\nlatter. The Lepidodendra have only an eccentric, vascular, medullary\r\nzone, the interval between which and the bark is filled up by cellular\r\ntissue.[107] In their structure, external configuration, mode of\r\nramification, and disposition of the leaves, they accord so closely\r\nwith the _Lycopodiaceæ_, that, notwithstanding the disparity in\r\nsize, M. Brongniart, Dr. Joseph Hooker, and other eminent botanists,\r\nconcur in regarding them as gigantic arborescent club-mosses[108] The\r\nliving species of Lycopodiaceæ amount to nearly two hundred, the\r\ngreater number of which, like the arborescent ferns, inhabit the\r\nislands of intertropical regions. They are diminutive plants, with\r\ndelicate foliage, none exceeding three feet in height; most of them\r\ntrail on the ground, but there are a few erect species, one of which\r\n(_Lycopodium densum_) is abundant in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[107] See M. Ad. Brongniart, Archives du Museum d'Hist. Nat. torn. i.\r\n(for 1839), pl. XXX.\r\n\r\n[108] Figures of Lepidodendra in _Wond._ p. 718. Pict. Atlas, pl. i.\r\niii. ix. xxvi. xxvii. xxxiii.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Club-mosses is an oval or cylindrical cone, which\r\nin some species is situated at the extremity of the branches, and\r\nconstitutes an imbricated spike. Now associated with the stems of the\r\nLepidodendra, and very often in masses of their foliage, and in some\r\ninstances attached to the extremities of the branches, are numerous\r\noblong, or sub-cylindrical, scaly cones, garnished with leaves. These\r\nhave received the names of _Lepidostrobi_ (scaly-cones), and are\r\nunquestionably the fruit of the trees with which they are imbedded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEPIDOSTROBUS.]\r\n\r\nLepidostrobus. _Lign. 40._--A cylindrical strobilus or cone, imbricated\r\nfrom above downwards, composed of winged scales, terminating in\r\nrhomboidal discs: the axis traversed by a longitudinal cavity or\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\nThese fossils have long been known to collectors, and are figured by\r\nMartin (_Petrif._ _Derbiensia_), Parkinson (_Org. Rem._ vol. i. pl.\r\nix.), and others. They are cylindrical imbricated bodies, rounded at\r\nboth extremities, from two to six or seven inches in length, and one\r\nor two inches in circumference. When broken asunder, a cylindrical\r\ncavity is exposed, which is sometimes hollow, but commonly filled\r\nwith mineral matter; and when specimens are found imbedded in shale,\r\nthe cone is fringed with linear-lanceolate bracteæ, as in _Lign. 40,\r\nfig. 3_. These fruits, like the fronds of ferns, often form the nuclei\r\nof ironstone nodules, and the leaves are frequently replaced either\r\nby a white hydrate of alumine, or by the mineral called galena, or\r\nsulphuret of lead, and the receptacles filled with the same substances.\r\nThe specimens from Coalbrook Dale are generally in this state of\r\nmineralization, and possess great brilliancy; they are interesting\r\nexamples of the electro-chemical changes which these fruits of the\r\ncarboniferous forests have undergone.[109]\r\n\r\n[109] These fossil cones are not liable to decompose, like the pyritous\r\nfruits from the Isle of Sheppey; they require no preparation for the\r\ncabinet; washing injures their lustre; a soft brush will safely remove\r\nany extraneous matter. There is a fine collection of Lepidostrobi in\r\nthe British Museum; see Petrifactions, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 40.

Vég. Foss. tom. ii. p. 47.\r\n\r\n_Triplosporite._--Additional light has recently been thrown on the\r\nstructure of the Lepidostrobi, by Dr. Robert Brown's examination of\r\na silicified specimen of the upper part of a strobilus, in which the\r\ninternal organization is beautifully displayed. The reader specially\r\ninterested in this department of fossil botany should refer to the\r\noriginal memoir by the illustrious President of the Linnæan Society,\r\nwith the accompanying plates that admirably exhibit the microscopic\r\nanalysis of the structure of this remarkable fossil; a slice of which\r\nwas shown me some years since by the late Marquis of Northampton.[111]\r\nThe external surface of the specimen is covered with hexagonal areolæ;\r\nthe transverse sections exhibit the appearance of the bracteæ and\r\nsporangia. The strobilus is formed of a central axis of relatively\r\nsmall diameter, from which proceed bracteæ, about thirteen in number,\r\nthat are densely approximated, and much imbricated; and of an equal\r\nnumber of sporangia, filled with innumerable microscopic sporules,\r\noriginally connected in threes. This triple composition of sporules\r\n(which differs from the constant quadruple union in the tribes of\r\nexisting plants presumed to be most nearly allied to the fossil,\r\nnamely the _Ophioglosseæ_ and _Lycopodiaceæ_) is expressed by the name\r\n_Triplosporite_, adopted by Dr. Brown to indicate this peculiarity of\r\nstructure, and the class or primary division to which the original\r\nplant is supposed to belong.[112]\r\n\r\n[111] The specimen brought to England was but two inches of the upper\r\nend of the cone; it was purchased conjointly by Lord Northampton, Dr.\r\nBrown, and the British Museum, for 30_l._!\r\n\r\n[112] See Trans.

These plants appear to be closely related to the\r\nLepidodendra; their mode of branching is shown in a beautiful specimen\r\n(in the museum of the Leeds Philos. Soc.) figured and described by Mr.\r\nDenny, which is also remarkable because it indicates the probability\r\nthat the Haloniæ, and the fossil stems, termed Knorriæ, are identical;\r\nfor the specimen in question, which in its branches is unquestionably\r\nof the former type, has the base of the stem impressed with the\r\nleaf-scars of the latter.\r\n\r\n_Knorria._--To this genus the authors of the Fossil Flora of Great\r\nBritain referred those stems which have projecting leaf-scars, arranged\r\nspirally. The beautiful specimen figured as _Knorria taxina_, _Lign.\r\n41, fig. 2_, closely resembles a young branch of Yew (_Taxus_), and\r\nperhaps might be more correctly named _Taxites_.\r\n\r\n_Bothrodendron and Ulodendron._--These genera, together with\r\n_Megaphyton_, are stems of a very remarkable character, and are easily\r\ndistinguished by the vertical rows of large and distant scars. The two\r\nfirst have two series of very deep oval depressions on opposite sides\r\nof the stems, arranged alternately in the specimens I have examined:\r\nfrom the size and form of these obliquely-oval cavities, it is supposed\r\nthat they were formed by the attachment of cones, and not by petioles;\r\nbut their real nature is involved in obscurity.[115]\r\n\r\n[115] Figured in Bd. pl. lvi.\r\n\r\nIn _Megaphyton_, the large ovate scars indicate the attachment of\r\ndeciduous branches or gigantic leaves, which did not grow all round the\r\nstem, but in a regular order of superposition on each side.[116]\r\n\r\n[116] Figured in Pict.

The term _Asterophyllites_, (expressive of the star-like\r\nform of the leaves,) applied to this family by M. Ad. Brongniart,\r\nincludes several fossil plants which are known to geologists under\r\ndifferent generic names; the following concise account may be useful to\r\nthe student.[117]\r\n\r\n[117] Consult _Tableau des Genres de Végétaux Fossiles_, par M.

Paris, 1849.\r\n\r\n1. _Calamodendron._--These are arborescent stems, ligneous internally,\r\nand covered with a smooth carbonaceous crust, without regular\r\nlongitudinal striæ, and not articulated; but the woody axis covered\r\nby this bark is deeply striated and articulated, resembling in this\r\nrespect the true Calamites. These stems have a large central pith,\r\nor medullary column, surrounded by a ligneous zone, which is formed\r\nof radiated bands, without circles of growth: the structure of the\r\ncarbonized bark is unknown.\r\n\r\n2. _Asterophyllites._--These are supposed to be the branches and\r\nfoliage of the stems above described.\r\n\r\n3. _Sphenophyllum._--Plants, differing in the form of the leaves,\r\nbut analogous in structure and mode of fructification to the\r\nAsterophyllites.\r\n\r\n4. _Annularia._--Herbaceous aquatic plants, distinct from the preceding.\r\n\r\n5. _Volkmannia._--These fossil plants are Asterophyllites in\r\nfructification.\r\n\r\nThe _Asterophyllites_ (_Lign. 42_) had branched articulated stems,\r\nwith verticillate leaves, arranged perpendicularly to the branches\r\nwhich supported them: but as the foliage is in most instances partially\r\nconcealed, the natural form is but seldom observable.\r\n\r\nThe original plants are supposed to have been a tribe of flowering\r\ndicotyledons, for small seed-vessels resembling those of the Cypress\r\nare often found with the foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 42.\r\n\r\nAsterophyllites equisetiformis; _nat._\r\n\r\n_Coal-shale._ (_Foss.

It is supposed that they\r\nwere aquatic plants, and that the stems and leaves floated on the\r\nsurface of the water.[118]\r\n\r\n[118] _Wond._ p. 717. Petrifactions, pp. 27, 43, &c.

Brongniart as herbaceous plants related to the _Marsiliaceæ_, or\r\nPepper-worts. The leaves are triangular, truncated at the summit, and\r\nvery deeply lobed and dentated. The fructification consists of sessile\r\naxillary or terminal spikes, composed of verticillate bracteæ, covering\r\nthe receptacles. This mode of fructification resembles that of the\r\nAsterophyllites.[119]\r\n\r\n[119] For details consult _Tab. des Genres de Vég.

We commence\r\nour examination with those remarkable tribes of gymnosperms, the\r\nCycadaceæ, which comprise the Zamiæ and Cycadeæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Cycadaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this subdivision of the vegetable kingdom, from their\r\nsingular structure and mode of growth, their simple cylindrical stems,\r\nand coronets of pinnated foliage, resembling that of certain palms,\r\ntheir usually gyrate vernation like that of the ferns, and their\r\nanomalous inflorescence and fructification, are objects of great\r\ninterest to the scientific botanist; while the abundance of their\r\nfossil remains in the secondary formations renders them of the highest\r\nimportance to the geologist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 45.\r\n\r\nFoliage and upper part of the Stem of Cycas revoluta 1/12 _nat._\r\n\r\n_In Kew Conservatory._]\r\n\r\nAs many kinds of Zamia[120] and Cycas are cultivated in our hot-houses,\r\nthe general appearance of the plants of this order must be familiar to\r\nthe reader: the annexed figure of a beautiful living Cycas in the Royal\r\nGardens at Kew, will serve to illustrate the general aspect of these\r\nexotics.\r\n\r\n[120] The Linnæan genus Zamia is now separated into five or six genera,\r\nas Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Dion, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Zamiæ are short plants, with stout cylindrical stems, beset\r\nwith thick scales, which are the bases of the petioles that have\r\nbeen shed: towards the summit the stem is garnished with a crown of\r\nelegant leaves; the fruit resembles the cones of pines. The leaves\r\nare pinnated, and very tough; their venation is either parallel as\r\nin endogens, or dichotomous as in ferns, but never reticulated as in\r\nexogens: in a young state they are coiled up like a crosier, as in\r\nferns.\r\n\r\nThe Cycadeæ have the general aspect of the Zamiæ, but differ in their\r\nfructification and other characters; and some species have the stem\r\nbifurcated towards the top, and attain a height of upwards of twenty\r\nfeet; for example, _C. circinalis_.\r\n\r\nThe stem in its internal structure[121] bears a close analogy to that\r\nof the Coniferæ; it has a central medullary column surrounded by a\r\nligneous cylinder, divided by cellular medullary rays, each composed\r\nof bundles of vessels, and a thick cellular cortical investment or\r\nfalse-bark,[122] composed of the persistent scales that formed the bases\r\nof the petioles. (See _Pl. V. fig. 5._)\r\n\r\n[121] See _Bd._ pl. lxii.\r\n\r\n[122] See _Bd._ vol. i. pp. 494-498, for detailed description of\r\nstructure in recent and fossil Zamiæ and Cycadeæ.\r\n\r\nThe existing species of Cycadaceæ are exclusively natives of hot\r\nregions, and chiefly inhabit the West Indies, South Africa, Equinoctial\r\nAmerica, Japan, New Holland, &c.; not one species is known in Europe: a\r\nfact in striking contrast with the abundance of fossil plants of this\r\norder, which occur throughout the secondary formations of England and\r\nthe continent.[123]\r\n\r\n[123] The most interesting collection of living Cycadeæ and Zamiæ near\r\nLondon, is that of James Yates, Esq., of Lauderdale House, Highgate; it\r\ncomprises choice examples of several of the sub-genera into which these\r\nplants are now divided by botanists.\r\n\r\nNo true cycads have hitherto been discovered in the carboniferous\r\ndeposits; it is in the floras of the secondary epochs, from the new\r\nRed to the Cretaceous inclusive, that this tribe of plants forms an\r\nimportant feature. The foliage, stems, and fruits, occur in a fossil\r\nstate; and as these organs cannot be referred with certainty to their\r\nrespective plants, distinct genera are formed for their reception.\r\n\r\n_Foliage._--From the tough and durable nature of the leaves, the\r\nfoliage of the Cycadeæ occurs in a fine state of preservation; and in\r\nthe fluvio-marine deposits of the Oolite of Yorkshire, many specimens\r\nof great beauty have been collected. I know not another locality in\r\nEngland so rich in fossils of this kind, as the cliffs along the coast\r\nnear Scarborough; Gristhorpe Bay is well known to collectors. Not only\r\nthe leaves, but also the fruits or cones occur, and of these, examples\r\nare to be seen in most public museums.[124] The leaves are carbonized,\r\nbut the venation is well preserved.\r\n\r\n[124] British Museum: see Petrifactions, p. 54, Room 1, Case F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 46.

The leaves are\r\nten or twelve inches long, and have fine lanceolate leaflets; they are\r\nabundant in the same beds, and are often associated with the cones or\r\nfruit[125] figured in _Lign. 48_.\r\n\r\n[125] Brit.

With these leaves, and the\r\novate cones (_Lign. 48_), are occasionally found a circle of leaves\r\nor elongated scales, locally termed \"_collars_,\" which Professor\r\nWilliamson has shown to be a zone formed by a scaly bud in which the\r\ngerm of the plants was inclosed. In the progress of development, the\r\nfruit burst through the upper part of the investing sheath, and, as it\r\ngrew to maturity, rose above the incurved elongated bracteæ, till the\r\nlatter formed a zone or \"collar\" around the pedicle of the cone.[129]\r\nThese fossils have been mistaken for flowers.[130]\r\n\r\n[128] _Podozamites_ of Braun.\r\n\r\n[129] Proc.

De la Beche. In my Wonders of Geology,\r\np. 387, and Geol. Isle of Wight, p. 395, the geological phenomena of\r\nthat most interesting locality, the Isle of Portland, are so fully\r\ndescribed, that it will not be necessary to dwell upon them; the\r\nstructure and affinities of the fossil vegetables are the especial\r\nobjects of our present inquiry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MANTELLIA NIDIFORMIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 50.

Trans, vol.\r\nii. 2d Series,) under the name of _Cycadeoidea_; of which Memoir the\r\naccount in _Bd._ p. 404, is an abstract. M. Ad. Brongniart, considering\r\nthese plants as a peculiar type, referred them to a new genus, which he\r\ndid me the honour to name _Mantellia_ (_Prod. Veg. Foss._). These stems\r\nor trunks are from one to two feet in height; the circumference of the\r\nlargest not exceeding three feet. The stem is subcylindrical, and\r\nthe external surface covered with the rhomboidal scars formed by the\r\nattachment of the leaf-stalks, and which are widest in their transverse\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThere are two species, which are readily distinguished by the form of\r\nthe stems, and the difference in the size of the cicatrices left by the\r\npetioles.\r\n\r\nThe most common kind is short, and spheroidal, and the leaf-scars are\r\nrelatively large; its shape has caused it to be named \"_Crows' nest_,\"\r\nby the quarrymen, who believe these plants to be nests that were built\r\nby crows in the trees of the petrified forest with which they are\r\nimbedded. The specific name (_nidiformis_) adopted by M. Brongniart,\r\nexpresses this popular notion.\r\n\r\n_Lign. 50._ represents a fine example from the Portland Dirt-bed, which\r\nexhibits a structure altogether similar to that which characterizes\r\nthe stems of recent cycadeous plants; namely, (_a_) a central mass of\r\ncellular tissue surrounded by circles of laminated ligneous rays or\r\nplates (_b_); then a zone of cellular tissue (_c_), and an external\r\ncylinder of false-bark (_d_). The mode of increase by buds, from\r\ngerms in the axillæ of the petioles, as in the living plants, is also\r\ndistinctly seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 51. Mantellia cylindrica.\r\n\r\n(_Brongn._); 1/8 _nat._\r\n\r\n(_Cycadites microphyllus. Bd._)\r\n\r\n_Wealden. Petrified Forest of the Isle of Portland._]\r\n\r\nThe other species is subcylindrical, and the leaf-scars are much\r\nsmaller and more regular than in _M. nidiformis_, indicating a more\r\ndelicate foliage, as expressed by Buckland's specific name: that of M.\r\nBrongniart refers to the cylindrical form of the stem. This plant was\r\nhigher and more slender than its associate. Numerous buds are seen in\r\nthe axillæ of the petioles in the specimen figured.\r\n\r\nThese fossils present, both externally and internally, a close relation\r\nto the bulbiform stems of the recent Cycadeæ, named _Encephalartos_, of\r\nSouth Africa.[132]\r\n\r\n[132] The fossil Cycads of the Isle of Portland are admirably described\r\nand illustrated in Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Essay, (p. 497, and pl.\r\nlx. lxi.), and their internal structure is fully explained.\r\n\r\nNeither the leaves nor the fruit are known: a cone found in the\r\nDirt-bed of Portland, and attributed to these plants, appears to belong\r\nto the coniferæ of the petrified forest. Examples of Mantelliæ have\r\nbeen found in the quarry of Portland-stone at Swindon, Wilts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CLATHRARIA LYELLII.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 52.

The\r\nspecimens figured in that work are the most illustrative hitherto\r\ndiscovered, with but one exception.[134]\r\n\r\n[133] EC C\r\nlathraria, _i.e._ _lattice stem_, from the scars left by the\r\npetioles.\r\n\r\n[134] They are now in the British Museum; see Petrifactions, p. 45.\r\n_Room_ I. _Case_ E.\r\n\r\nFrom the imperfect state of the remains of these plants, the structure\r\nand affinities of the originals were very ambiguous, and the fossils\r\nhave been placed by some eminent botanists with the Liliaceæ, and by\r\nothers with the Asphodeleæ; their true botanical position is doubtless\r\nwith the Cycadaceæ; for in some points they resemble the Zamiæ, in\r\nothers the Cycadeæ.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the Clathraria is composed of a solid internal axis, the\r\nsurface of which is covered with reticulated fibres; the large branched\r\nspecimen of this part, figured in _Lign. 52_, is the finest example\r\nhitherto obtained: it was discovered, with bones of the Iguanodon,\r\nin a quarry near Cuckfield, Sussex, in 1820. The axis is invested\r\nwith a very thick false-bark, formed of the consolidated bases of the\r\nleaf-stalks, the insertions of which are rhomboidal and transverse.\r\nThe outer surface of the bark is consequently marked with elevated\r\nlozenge-shaped cicatrices (_Lign. 53_), separated from each other by a\r\nmarginal furrow, which is surrounded by a parallel ridge or band of a\r\nfibrous structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 53. Clathraria Lyellii.\r\n\r\n1/4 _nat._\r\n\r\nA stem, with rhomboidal transverse scars, left by the petioles; broken\r\ntransversely and separated, to show the internal axis at _a_, which,\r\nif the pieces were united, would be received in the cavity below the\r\ndepression, or cicatrix, on the middle of the upper portion, _b_, was\r\nprobably the situation of a resinous secretion, like the dragon-blood\r\nin the Dracæna.]\r\n\r\nThe cortical zone is generally converted into a cylinder of stone,\r\nwhich in some examples separates from the axis. In a beautiful specimen\r\nof this kind, _Lign. 54_, the axis projects and is surrounded by the\r\nfalse-bark.\r\n\r\nThe axis is solid, and has its surface strongly marked with interrupted\r\nridges. This surface has generally patches of vascular tissue adhering\r\nto it; and there are here and there deep pits, or lacunæ, which\r\nprobably contained a resinous secretion. Thin transverse sections\r\nof the axis, prepared with Canada balsam, and examined under the\r\nmicroscope, only give faint traces of cellular tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 54.\r\n\r\nClathraria Lyellii; 1/4 _nat._\r\n\r\n_Wealden Sandstone._\r\n\r\n_Tilgate Forest._\r\n\r\nPortion of a stem, scored by the cicatrices of the petioles; showing\r\nthe Axis _a_, surrounded by the cortical cylinder.]\r\n\r\nI have spared neither trouble nor expense in endeavouring to detect\r\nthe organization of this plant; numerous sections of stems have been\r\ncut, and examined microscopically, but very few exhibit any traces of\r\nstructure; and in those which retain some vestiges of organization,\r\nthe siliceous mass which permeates the vascular tissue, is not\r\nsufficiently transparent to yield satisfactory results. It can only\r\nbe inferred that in their internal organization, as in their external\r\ncharacters, the Clathrariæ were most nearly allied to the Cycadeæ or\r\nZamiæ. A remarkable specimen, (_Lign. 56_,) discovered in a stratum of\r\nChalk-marl, near Bonchurch, confirms this view, and throws much light\r\non the nature and relations of these vegetables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 55.\r\n\r\nPetiole of Clathraria Lyellii;\r\n\r\n    _a._ External aspect.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Inner surface.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Vascular pits left by the separation of the leaf.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis fossil is a portion of the summit of a stem garnished with\r\npersistent petioles, or leaf-stalks; it is fifteen inches in length,\r\nand nearly perfect at the top; and at the lower end, which has been\r\nbroken off transversely, the inner axis (_Lign. 56 a_.), surrounded\r\nby the false-bark formed by the confluence and consolidation of the\r\nbases of the petioles, is exposed. The stem has been stript of the\r\nleaf-stalks at the lowermost part, and exhibits the characteristic\r\nlattice-like scars. The petioles are for the most part entire; some of\r\nthem are abortive, and others, which have supported leaves, are marked\r\non the summits with vascular pits, indicating that the foliage was\r\nshed naturally; as shown in _Lign. 55 a_. These petioles were probably\r\npersistent for some years, as in the existing Cycads. The opposite side\r\nof the stem to that represented is covered with elongated and flattened\r\npetioles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 56.\r\n\r\nClathraria Lyellii; 1/4 _nat._\r\n\r\n_Chalk-marl.

Mr. Saxby, of Bonchurch, has\r\nfavoured me with the loan of a thin section of a stem of Clathraria in\r\nwhich the bundles of vascular tissue in the petioles appear to be made\r\nup of spiral vessels. From what has been advanced, it is obvious that\r\nthese remarkable plants of the Wealden flora were gymnosperms, closely\r\nrelated to the Cycadeæ.\r\n\r\nVestiges of roots, seed-vessels, and panicles, have been found in the\r\nWealden, which may possibly belong to the Clathraria; but the evidence\r\nas to their presumed relationship is at present too vague to require\r\nfurther notice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 57.\r\n\r\nClathraria Lyellii; 1/2 _nat._\r\n\r\nSpecimen, showing the water-worn external surface.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ENDOGENITES.]\r\n\r\nEndogenites erosa.--(_Geol S. E._ pl. i.; Tilg. Foss. pl. iii.; and by\r\nDr. Fitton in _Geol. Trans._ vol. iv.)--The genus _Endogenites_ was\r\nestablished by M. Ad. Brongniart for the reception of those fossil\r\nstems and woods, whose internal structure is endogenous, but which are\r\ntoo imperfect to be referred to any particular family. In this category\r\nmust be placed certain silicified stems having a carbonaceous cortical\r\ninvestment, which I discovered in the strata of Tilgate Forest, in 1820.\r\n\r\nThese fossils often occur in the layers of lignite which traverse the\r\nclay-beds in some parts of the Weald of Sussex. They are from one to\r\neight inches in diameter, and five or six feet in length, and of very\r\nirregular shapes; I have not observed any indications of branches.\r\nSome specimens are subcylindrical in the middle, and gradually taper\r\nto a point at each end; others are of a depressed clavated form, like\r\nsome of the Cacteæ or Euphorbiaceæ. They are generally silicified,\r\nand, when _in situ_, are invested with a friable carbonaceous crust,\r\nof a glossy lustre, which soon falls to pieces on exposure to the\r\natmosphere, so that cabinet specimens seldom retain any vestiges of it.\r\nWhen this coaly matter is removed, the surface of the silicified stem\r\nis seen to be traversed by numerous fine meandering grooves, and deep,\r\ntortuous channels, disposed in an irregular manner, in a longitudinal\r\ndirection. These channels or vessels, which are generally lined\r\nwith quartz crystals, give the surface that eroded appearance which\r\nsuggested the specific name, erosa; but this term is inapplicable,\r\nfor the perforations and sinuosities are not the effect of erosion,\r\nbut result from the structure of the original. Polished sections,\r\nseen by transmitted light, are represented in Dr. Fitton's memoir\r\n(_Geol. Trans._ vol. iv.); and I have had many slices ground as thin\r\nas possible, in the hope of detecting the characters of the vascular\r\ntissue. In one example there are indications of a cycadeous structure,\r\nwhich favour the conclusion, that the originals belonged to an extinct\r\ntribe of gymnosperms; but in other specimens, bundles of vascular\r\ntissue, resembling those of palms, are apparent.\r\n\r\nLarge water-worn stems of _Endogenites_ are occasionally washed out of\r\nthe Wealden cliffs at Hastings, and in Sandown and Brook Bays, in the\r\nIsle of Wight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CONIFERÆ.]\r\n\r\nFossil coniferæ.\r\n\r\nThe other great natural order of Gymnospermous phanerogamiæ,[135] the\r\n_Coniferæ_, or cone-bearing--so named from the form of their fruit, of\r\nwhich the fir-cones and larch-juli are familiar examples,--comprise the\r\nextensive tribes of Firs and Pines, and the Cypresses, Yews, Junipers,\r\nCedars, &c., among which are the loftiest trees on the face of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n[135] Signifying, flowering plants with naked seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Conifers are all arborescent, having numerous branches, which are\r\nin general disposed with much regularity. The leaves are commonly\r\nacicular or needle-shaped, narrow, and linear: in two or three genera,\r\nhowever, (_Dammara_, _Podocarpus_,) the foliage departs remarkably from\r\nthe ordinary type, the leaves being broad and flat. The structure of\r\nthe stem, though in its general characters essentially exogenous (see\r\n_Plate IV. fig. 4_),--that is, having a central pith, medullary rays,\r\nzones of vascular tissue, and concentric circles of growth,--differs\r\nin the almost entire absence of spiral vessels, and in the peculiar\r\nmodification of the radiating bands of woody fibre, which are made up\r\nof uniform longitudinal vessels, and run parallel with the medullary\r\nrays. The lateral walls of these vessels have longitudinal rows of\r\nareolæ, which are generally circular or elliptical, but when in contact\r\nare angular and polygonal: each areola has a small pore or punctation\r\nin the centre. These discs, glands, or ducts, as they are called, are\r\nvariously arranged in different genera; they are generally confined to\r\nthe contiguous and corresponding lateral surfaces of the fibres; and\r\noccur rarely, if ever, on the inner and outer aspects of the vessels.\r\nIn the recent genus Pinus the rows of ducts are single in some species;\r\nin others both single and double series occur, but never more than two,\r\nand in the latter case the ducts are always parallel to each other (see\r\npl. v. 3_b_. _Wond._ pp. 696, 725). But in the _Araucariæ_, or Norfolk\r\nIsland Pines, the vessels have double, triple, and sometimes quadruple,\r\nrows of discs, of smaller size than in the common pines; and in the\r\ndouble series, these bodies are always arranged alternately (_Wond._ p.\r\n696. _Bd._ 56 _a_.); Mr. Nicol states that there are about 50 discs in\r\nthe length of 1/20 inch, the diameter of each not exceeding 1/1000 inch.\r\n\r\nThe form and arrangement of these ducts, and the structure of the\r\nmedullary rays, are the characters on which the scientific botanist\r\nrelies for the detection of the affinities of the coniferous trees,\r\nwhose mineralized trunks and branches, in a fragmentary state, are, for\r\nthe most part, the only relics of these important tribes of the lost\r\nfloras of the earlier ages of our planet.[136]\r\n\r\n[136] I know not a more delightful and instructive branch of science for\r\nthe young and inquiring of both sexes, than this department of Fossil\r\nBotany, which the recent improvements in the microscope have rendered\r\nso accessible; and yet there are but few cultivators of fossil botany\r\nin England!\r\n\r\nThe great value of these data will be shown in the sequel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stems, fruit, and foliage, of Coniferæ, occur in the various\r\nfossiliferous deposits, from those containing the earliest traces of\r\nterrestrial vegetation to the newest tertiary strata; and a large\r\nproportion of the petrified wood found in the British formations\r\nbelongs to trees of this order. The presence of rows of ducts on the\r\nligneous fibres, which is peculiar to this division of gymnosperms,\r\nas we have already explained (_ante_, p. 58), is so easily detected\r\nby microscopic examination, that the merest fragment of fossil\r\nconiferous wood retaining internal structure, may without difficulty\r\nbe recognized. The number of rows, and the opposite or alternate\r\narrangement of the areolæ, are characters which, in the living pines\r\nand firs, enable us to refer the respective trees to European or exotic\r\nforms; but in the fossil coniferous wood, much diversity exists in\r\nother not less important points of structure, and for the successful\r\ncultivation of this department of fossil botany, works especially\r\ndevoted to the subject must be consulted. To the English student, Mr.\r\nWitham's beautiful volume, \"Observations on the Structure of Fossil\r\nVegetables, Edinburgh, 1831,\" will be found a valuable guide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CONIFEROUS WOOD.]\r\n\r\nFossil Coniferous Wood.--The coniferous wood of the secondary\r\nformations of England, belongs for the most part to the Araucarian\r\ntype: that is, the glands, when in double rows, are placed alternately,\r\nas in the Norfolk Island Pines (_Wond._ p. 696), and not side by side,\r\nas in the common European species of firs and pines (_Bd._ p. 486).\r\nNumerous sections of this kind of fossil wood are figured by Mr.\r\nWitham, from specimens obtained from Lennel Braes, on the banks of the\r\nTweed, near Coldstream; and from near Allanbank Mill, in Berwickshire\r\n(_Obs. Foss. Veg._ p. 14); a fossil trunk, 40 feet long, discovered in\r\nCraigleith Quarry, near Edinburgh, at a depth of 136 feet, possessed\r\nthe same structure.\r\n\r\nPalæoxylon (_coniferous wood of the Coal Measures_).--The existence of\r\nconiferous trees in the Carboniferous flora, and the fact that their\r\ntrunks and branches had contributed to the formation of coal, was first\r\ndiscovered and clearly demonstrated by Mr. Witham in the work to which\r\nreference has been made. Figures of the peculiar structure observable\r\nin thin slices of coal, are given in _Obs. Foss. Veg._ pl. iii. iv. v.\r\nThis carbonized wood resembles that of the Araucariæ in the multiple\r\nseries of ducts, and their alternate arrangement; but the presence of\r\nthick compound medullary rays in these stems,--a character unknown in\r\nany living conifers,--led M. Brongniart to place them in a separate\r\ngenus--_Palæoxylon_ (ancient wood); characterized by the presence\r\nof medullary rays formed of numerous layers of cells, which are not\r\narranged in superimposed series, and that present a lanceolate or oval\r\nform, in a section perpendicular to their direction.[137]\r\n\r\n[137] The _Pinites Withami_, and _P. medullaris_, of Lindley and Hutton,\r\nfigured in Mr. Witham's work, belong to this genus. It may interest the\r\nreader to know that slices of these woods prepared for the microscope\r\nby Mr. Nicol, (presented to me by the late Dr. Henry, of Manchester,)\r\nnot only expose the vegetable organization in an admirable manner, but\r\nalso form beautiful objects for the exhibition of polarization.\r\n\r\nPeuce.--Another species of coniferous wood from the coal is thus named;\r\nit differs from the former in the medullary rays being composed but of\r\none layer of superposed cells.\r\n\r\nAraucarites (_Dadoxylon of Endlechen_).--This term is employed to\r\ndesignate the fossil wood whose structure is apparently identical\r\nwith that of the living species of Araucariæ, having the same kind\r\nof medullary rays, and the ligneous fibres studded with discs or\r\nareolæ, which are polygonal, often hexagonal, and disposed in several\r\nalternating series. This wood is common in the Lias, Oolite, Wealden,\r\nand Chalk.\r\n\r\nDrifted fragments of coniferous wood of this type occur in the\r\nStonesfield slate, associated with leaves and fruits of cycadeæ,\r\nand with marine shells, bones of reptiles, fishes, and mammalia; at\r\nScarborough, with the ferns and zamiæ previously described; at Swindon,\r\nin the Portland oolite, with belemnites, ammonites, trigoniæ, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STERNBERGIA.]\r\n\r\nSternbergia.--To the Araucarian tribe, according to the recent\r\ninvestigations of Professor Williamson, must be referred certain\r\nfossil stems found in the coal-measures, and named _Sternbergiæ_.[138]\r\nThese are long solid cylindrical casts of sandstone or clay, with\r\nannular constrictions, which are generally invested with a thin film\r\nof carbonaceous matter; when this crust is removed the surface is\r\nfound to be marked with longitudinal ridges. These fossils were once\r\nsupposed to be the stems of plants allied to Yucca or Dracæna; but,\r\nas was first shown by Mr. Dawson and Mr. Dawes,[139] they are merely\r\nsandstone casts of the medullary axis or cylinder of an extinct genus\r\nof coniferæ, allied to the Araucariæ: a specimen in which the cast was\r\nsurrounded by a thick ligneous cylinder, heaving enabled that acute\r\nobserver to detect the structure of the original.[140] The Sternbergiæ\r\nare sandstone casts of central cavities existing within the true pith;\r\nwhich cavities, under some favourable conditions, were filled with\r\ninorganic materials. Mr. Williamson is inclined to believe that all\r\nthe coniferous wood from the coal-measures, belonging to the genus\r\n_Dadoxylon_, is referable to the trees of whose piths the _Sternbergiæ\r\napproximatæ_ are internal casts; and that some of the foliaceous\r\nappendages of these trees have been confounded with Lepidodendra.[141]\r\n\r\n[138] See Pictorial Atlas, pl. xviii. p. 53.\r\n\r\n[139] On the Coal formation of Nova Scotia, Geol. Proc. 1846.\r\n\r\n[140] See Prof. Williamson's Memoir on Sternbergia, Manchester Philos.\r\nTrans. 1851.\r\n\r\n[141] Ibid. p. 355.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetrified Forests of Conifers.--The most remarkable assemblage of\r\nfossil conifers is that presented in the well-known quarries in the\r\nIsland of Portland, to which allusion was made when describing the\r\nMantelliæ obtained from that locality (_ante_, p. 157). Referring to\r\n_Wond._ p. 385,[142] for an account of the geological circumstances\r\nunder which the phenomena occur, it will suffice to state that a\r\nforest of pines appears to have been submerged, and the trunks to have\r\nbecome petrified, whilst standing erect on the spot where they grew;\r\nthe Cycads still shoot up as it were between the stems, and the roots\r\nof the trees, though changed into flint, extend into the bed of mould\r\nwhence they originally derived support, and which is so little altered\r\nin appearance, as to be called the _Dirt-bed_, by the quarrymen; thus\r\nrealizing the fable of the petrified city in Arabian story, whose\r\ninhabitants were turned into stone, in the varied attitudes of life.\r\n\r\n[142] Geol. I. of Wight, p. 394. Petrifactions, p. 56.\r\n\r\nNo foliage has been observed in connexion with these trees; not a leaf\r\nhas been found in the rocks: a cone, nearly related to the fruit of\r\nAraucaria excelsa, was discovered in the Dirt-bed.\r\n\r\nAt Brook-point, in the Isle of Wight, an equally interesting fact may\r\nbe observed. At the base of the cliff, which is entirely composed of\r\nWealden clays, shales, and sandstones, there is a vast accumulation of\r\npetrified firs and pines, imbedded in the indurated grit that forms\r\nthe lowermost strata on the sea-shore, and of which the reefs and\r\nrocks, produced by the encroachments of the sea, and that extend far\r\nfrom land, are composed. These can be examined at low-water, and the\r\nobserver, upon lifting up the fuci and algæ which cover them, will\r\nfind the rocks and masses of stone to consist of petrified trunks of\r\nconiferæ. There are no erect trees as in Portland; on the contrary, the\r\nstems are prostrate, and lie confusedly intermingled, and associated\r\nwith bones of Iguanodons and other reptiles, and large mussel-shells;\r\nthe whole presenting the characters of a raft of forest trees which had\r\ndrifted down the stream of a vast river, and entangled in its course\r\nthe limbs and carcasses of animals that were floating in the water, and\r\nthe shells that inhabited the river, and at length became submerged in\r\nthe bed of the delta or estuary. Both foliage and fruit have been found\r\nin the Wealden deposits at Brook, and will be described hereafter.[143]\r\n\r\n[143] See Geol. I. of Wight, chap. x. and xi.\r\n\r\nIn the sands of the Desert of Sahara, in Egypt,--among the mammalian\r\nbones of the Sub-Himalayas,--and in the tertiary deposits of Virginia\r\nassociated with cycads,--drifted trunks of conifers have been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nFossil trees of this family also occur in various localities in\r\nAustralia and Van Diemen's Land, the wood of which is in some parts\r\ncalcified, and in others silicified. The same trunk often has\r\nexternally a white friable calcareous zone, several inches thick,\r\ntraversed by veins of silex, or opaline chalcedony, while the centre\r\nis a silicified mass; in both states the internal structure may be\r\ndetected. This kind of fossil wood is to be seen in most cabinets, a\r\nlarge quantity having been sent to England by emigrants.[144] These\r\nfossil trees appear to have been subjected to the same mutations as\r\nthose of the Isle of Portland, for they are described as standing erect\r\nto the height of several feet in a bed of arid sand, apparently in the\r\nplaces where they grew; their petrified branches being scattered around\r\nthem. They so entirely preserve their natural appearance, that one of\r\nthe colonists mentions among the extraordinary sights he witnessed on\r\nhis first arrival in New Holland, the burning of trees into lime to\r\nmanure the ground.\r\n\r\n[144] My late friend, Sir Francis Chantrey, had a magnificent specimen,\r\nwhich, is now in the British Museum. See Petrifactions, p, 59.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CONIFERÆ OF AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nA fossil pine forest, on the eastern coast of Australia, in the\r\ninlet called Lake Macquarrie, is described by the Rev. B. Clarke, as\r\noccurring at the base of a mountain range, composed of conglomerate and\r\nsandstone, with subordinate beds of lignite; an alluvial plain extends\r\nto the water's edge, covering the sandstone rock which is seen _in\r\nsitu_ beneath. Throughout this plain, stumps of fossil trees project\r\nfrom the ground, and present the appearance of a forest in which the\r\ntrees have all been broken off at the same level. At the distance of\r\nsome yards from the shore, a reef is formed by vertical rows of the\r\npetrified stems, which project out of the water. Many of the fossil\r\nstems on the strand have the remains of roots extending into the\r\nsandstone below the alluvial deposit, and, like those in the Island of\r\nPortland, are in some instances surrounded by an accumulation of rock,\r\nwhich forms a mound of a higher level than the surface of the stratum.\r\nThe trunks are, generally, three or four feet high, and from two to\r\nsix feet in diameter. The wood is silicified, and veins of chalcedony\r\ntraverse its substance between the concentric rings and medullary rays;\r\nin several examples, from 60 to 120 annual circles of growth were\r\nobservable. Beds of lignite occur in the neighbouring hills, both above\r\nand below the fossil trees; many localities along the eastern coast of\r\nAustralia are mentioned, as presenting similar phenomena. I may add\r\nthat the only fragment of petrified wood found by Mr. Walter Mantell in\r\nNew Zealand is coniferous.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Derwent, in Australia, opalized coniferous\r\ntrees of a similar character were observed under very extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, by the distinguished traveller, Count Strzelecki.\r\nTruncated stems were found standing erect in a bed of scoriaceous\r\nbasalt (lava) and trachytic conglomerate: but in some instances only\r\nbasaltic casts of the trunks remain. This curious phenomenon can\r\nonly be explained by supposing the silicified stems to have resisted\r\nthe intense heat of the incandescent lava, while trees placed in\r\ncircumstances unfavourable to their petrifaction were consumed: but\r\nthe latter, being either saturated with water, or fresh and green,\r\nwere burnt slowly, and left cylindrical moulds in the cooled basaltic\r\nscoriæ, with impressions of the external surface of the bark; these\r\nmoulds were filled Tip by a subsequent eruption, and thus basaltic\r\ncasts of the consumed trees were formed.[145]\r\n\r\n[145] Physical Description of New South Wales, by Count Strzelecki.\r\n\r\nConiferous Wood in Oxford Clay.--It would occupy too much space to\r\nnotice the numerous localities in which fossil remains of conifers\r\noccur in the Liassic and Oolitic formations of England.\r\n\r\nIn the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays water-worn trunks and branches of\r\nlarge pine-trees are often met with. An interesting deposit of these\r\nremains was brought to light by my youngest son (Mr. Reginald Mantell),\r\nwhen constructing the branch line of railway from the Great Western to\r\nTrowbridge, in Wilts. In the progress of the work, extensive sections\r\nwere cut through the Oxford Clay, and laid bare a large quantity of\r\ndrifted wood, much of which was not petrified, but in the state of\r\nbog-wood, and was used for fuel by the workmen. Trunks ten or twelve\r\nfeet long were met with, to which serpulæ, oysters (_Ostrea delta_),\r\nand other shells were adherent. These vegetable remains were associated\r\nwith Belemnites, Belemnoteuthides, Ammonites, &c.; and had evidently\r\nbeen drifted far out to sea by currents.[146]\r\n\r\n[146] See _Wond._ p. 502. Geol. Journal, vol. vi. p. 311.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CONIFEROUS WOOD.]\r\n\r\nConiferous Wood in the Chalk formation.--The arenaceous limestones\r\nof the Greensand of Kent and Sussex abound, in some localities, in\r\nwater-worn masses of coniferous wood, which are often perforated by\r\nboring mollusks, as _Teredo_, _Fistulana_, _Gastrochæna_, &c. In the\r\nIguanodon quarry of Kentish rag, near Maidstone, large quantities\r\nof these remains occur, and Mr. Bensted has collected several cones\r\nbelonging to different kinds of conifers; one of these appears to be\r\na species of _Abies_, or Fir:[147] it was associated with fragments of\r\ntrunks and branches, whose internal structure proved their relation to\r\nthe fruit. _Plate V. fig. 2_, are microscopic views of transverse and\r\nlongitudinal sections of this wood; 2_a_ shows the cellular tissue in\r\na transverse slice, seen by reflected light; 2_b_ a vertical section\r\nin the direction of the medullary rays, exhibiting the vessels studded\r\nwith single rows of glands. This wood occurs both in a calcareous and\r\nsiliceous state; in some examples the external zones are calcareous,\r\nand the inner siliceous; in others the entire branch is changed into\r\nblack flint, in which the coniferous structure is beautifully preserved.\r\n\r\n[147] It is figured and described as _Abies Benstedi_, by the Author.\r\nGeol. Proc. January, 1843.\r\n\r\nNear Willingdon, in Sussex (_Geol. S. E._ p. 172), a bed of sand,\r\nimmediately beneath the Galt, contains a layer of water-worn fragments\r\nof stems and branches, of small size; they are generally perforated by\r\n_Gastrochænce_, and the cavities formed by these depredators are filled\r\nwith particles of green chlorite sand. The structure of this wood is\r\nrepresented in _Plate V. fig. 3^a_ a transverse, and 3_b_ a vertical\r\nsection, viewed by reflected light; in 3_b_ the vessels are dotted\r\nwith two parallel longitudinal rows of very minute glands, arranged\r\nalternately, as in the Araucariæ; a fragment of one of the medullary\r\nrays is seen near the middle of the specimen.\r\n\r\nIn this deposit of coniferous wood, two or more fruits apparently\r\nreferable to _Zamiæ_ have been discovered; one specimen, five and\r\na half inches long, and of an elongated cylindrical form, covered\r\nwith rhomboidal eminences, I have figured and described as _Zamites\r\nSussexiensis_.[148]\r\n\r\n[148] Geol. Proc. 1843.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 58. Fragment of Coniferous Wood in Flint.\r\n\r\n_From a wall in Lewes Priory,_]\r\n\r\nThe White Chalk of England has afforded but few traces of plants of\r\nthis family. Fragments of coniferous wood are, however, occasionally\r\nfound in the state of carbonaceous, or reddish brown friable masses,\r\nand when this substance is removed, the surface of the chalk is seen to\r\nbe marked with impressions of ligneous fibres; sometimes the surface\r\nis studded over with little pyriform eminences, which are cretaceous\r\ncasts of perforations made by insects in the wood. These specimens,\r\nwhen all traces of the wood are absent, are very puzzling to those who\r\nare not aware of their origin.\r\n\r\nOccasionally silicified fragments of wood are found imbedded in flint.\r\nI have an interesting specimen of this kind obtained from a wall in\r\nLewes Priory (_Lign. 58_), and though it must have been exposed to the\r\ninfluence of the weather for nearly eight centuries, its surface still\r\nexhibits coniferous structure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOOD IN FLINT.]\r\n\r\nTertiary Coniferous Wood.--The Tertiary formations in some localities\r\nabound in coniferous plants and trees, which, in the Paris basin,\r\nare associated with bones of mammalia; several species of pine\r\n(_Pinus_) and of yew (_Taxus_) from those deposits are described by M.\r\nBrongniart. I have collected fossils of this kind from the London Clay\r\nof the Isle of Sheppey, Bracklesham Bay, and Bognor in Sussex, and Alum\r\nBay, in the Isle of Wight; and from the plastic clay at Newhaven.\r\n\r\nFossil Foliage and Fruit of Conifers.--From this digression on the\r\npine-forests and drift-wood of the secondary formations, we return to\r\nthe examination of the foliage and fruits of this order of vegetables\r\nthat are preserved in the mineral kingdom.\r\n\r\nAraucaria peregrina (_Lindley and Hutton_). _Lign. 59, fig.1._--With\r\nthe trunks and branches of conifers of the Lias, cones and foliage\r\nare occasionally found: a beautiful example of a branch with the\r\nleaves preserved, is figured, _Lign. 59_. This fossil has been so\r\nadmirably cleared from the shale which invested it (by Miss Philpot)\r\nthat even the surface of the leaves is exposed. It so closely\r\nresembles a twig of _Altingia excelsa_, that the eminent authors of\r\nFoss. Flor. have named it as above. But M. Brongniart states that the\r\nfoliage differs from that of the two living groups of Araucariæ: in\r\n_Araucaria Brasiliensis_, the leaves are flat, in _Altingia excelsa_,\r\nquadrangular; in the fossil the leaves are short, fleshy, arranged\r\nspirally, and inserted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 59.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Part of a Branch of Araucaria peregrina; _nat._\r\n             _Lias, Lyme Regis._\r\n\r\n       2.--Calamites nodosus with foliage; _nat._ _Coal-shale_,\r\n             (see _ante_, p. 109).\r\n]\r\n\r\nPinites; a name applied to those fossil leaves and fruits which agree\r\nin their general character with the recent genus Pinus; upwards\r\nof thirty species are known.[149] In the Pines, as botanically\r\ndistinguished from the Firs (_Abies_), the leaves arise in bundles\r\nof from two to five; and the scales of the cones are thickened, and\r\nterminate in discs more or less defined. In Firs, (Larch, Cedar, &c.)\r\nthe scales have thin edges, and the leaves are solitary.\r\n\r\n[149] See Endlechen's Synopsis Coniferarum.\r\n\r\nPinites Fittoni. _Geol. Isle of Wight_; 2d edit, p. 457.--Several cones\r\nwith the above characters have been found in the Wealden formation. A\r\ncone figured and described by Dr Fitton, is remarkable for a double\r\nprominence on each scale: It was supposed to resemble the fruit of\r\n_Dammara_, but the strobilus of the latter is like that of the Cedar of\r\nLebanon, in which the edges of the scales are thin. The Wealden fossil\r\nappears to be a genuine pine, and may be distinguished by the name of\r\nits discoverer, _Pinites Fittoni_; a small figure of the only known\r\nspecimen is given, _Wond._ p. 399, _fig._ 4.\r\n\r\nI have collected from the Wealden strata of the Isle of Wight three or\r\nfour small cones, which resemble those of a species of Araucaria; they\r\nare ovate, imbricated, with acuminated scales, which are recurved at\r\nthe apex. The fossils figured in _Wond._ p. 399, _figs._ 2 and 3, are,\r\nI believe, water-worn specimens of the same species.[150]\r\n\r\n[150] I subjoin a definition of the genera Pinus and Abies, for the use\r\nof the student.\r\n\r\nPinus.--_Fruit_-catkins ovate, roundish, or cylindrical closely set\r\nwith thick two-flowered scales; forming an imbricated cone, composed of\r\nnumerous ligneous angular, or flat, rigid scales, having attached to\r\nthe inside of each two seeds crowned with a thin membraneous, falcate,\r\noblong, or roundish wing; the scales are composed of a thick woody\r\nsubstance, forming an angular surface, with a recurved point. The Pines\r\nare evergreen trees, with from two to five narrow, angular leaves\r\nspringing from each sheath. Cotyledons four to twelve.\r\n\r\nAbies.--Cones with thin flat scales, which are more membranous at the\r\nextremities than in Pines: the leaves are emarginate, short solitary,\r\nneedle-shaped, angular or flat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WALCHIA.]\r\n\r\nWalchia. _Lign. 60._--The fossil coniferæ thus named by Sternberg,\r\nhave numerous closely set, regularly pinnated branches, resembling\r\nthose of _Araucaria excelsa_, and which are thickly beset with foliage.\r\nThe leaves are sessile, compact, enlarged at the base, tetragonal\r\nor falciform, and slightly decurrent; they often vary considerably\r\nin form and length on the same bough. The branches are in some\r\nexamples terminated by oblong cones, composed of imbricated, oval or\r\nlanceolate, pointed scales, the summits of which are not recurved,\r\nas in the Araucariæ. The trees of this genus are closely related to\r\nthe _Araucaria excelsa_, and _A. Cunninghami_. Some species occur in\r\nthe Coal formation at St. Etienne and Autun;[151] others (as _Walchia\r\nhypnoides_) in the schists of Lodève, and in the copper slates of the\r\nZechstein in Mansfeld.[152]\r\n\r\n[151] \"Mines de Houille de Vettin, &c.\" See \"Tableau des Vég.

Walchia hypnoides; 1/3 _nat._\r\n\r\n_Permian, Lodève_.\r\n\r\nPart of a bough with six of the branches bearing terminal cones.]\r\n\r\nAbietites.--To the Abies, or Fir, several cones found in the Wealden\r\ndeposits of Sussex and Hants closely approximate in the form and\r\nstructure of their scales. The most remarkable is the very elongated\r\nconiferous fruit, first discovered by me in the Wealden at Brook Point,\r\nand described and figured in my Geology of the Isle of Wight (_2d\r\nedit._ p. 452), under the name of _Abietites Dunkeri_, in honour of\r\nthe eminent geologist who has so successfully and diligently explored\r\nthe Wealden of the North of Germany.\r\n\r\nI have been so fortunate as to collect from thirty to forty specimens\r\nof these fruits of the conifers of the country of the Iguanodon,\r\nassociated with trunks and branches, and imperfect vestiges of single\r\nlanceolate leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 61.\r\n\r\nAbietites Dunkeri.\r\n\r\n_Wealden; Isle of Wight;_\r\n\r\n1/3 _nat._\r\n\r\nFir-cone, showing the imbricated scales, and many bracteæ.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABIETITES DUNKERI.]\r\n\r\nAbietites Dunkeri. _Lign. 61._--These cones are of a cylindrical form,\r\nand greatly elongated: the largest specimen is thirteen inches in\r\nlength, and but three inches in circumference. The scales are broad,\r\nslightly convex without and concave within, obovate or subrotund, with\r\na prominent midrib, edges thin and entire. Leaves solitary, slender,\r\nslightly curved, from 1 inch to 1-1/2 inch in length. The cones\r\nwere garnished with bracteæ, which are seen on the margins of the\r\nfossil when imbedded in the rock. Whether the foliage that forms the\r\nconstituent substance of a large proportion of the bituminous coal of\r\nHanover (_ante_, p. 74), and which has been figured and of the named\r\nby Dr. Dunker _Abietites Linkii_, belongs to the same species of Fir\r\nas these cones, I am unable to determine. The seeds are of an ovate\r\nform: the pericarp is in the state of carbon, and filled or lined with\r\npyrites or calc-spar.\r\n\r\nThese cones are generally found more or less pyritified, and are\r\nextremely beautiful objects when first collected; but like the fruits\r\nfrom the Isle of Sheppey, similarly mineralized, often decompose, in\r\nspite of every precaution, after exposure to the air but for a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nA small sub-ovate fir-cone found with coniferous wood in the\r\nKentish-rag of Mr. Bensted's quarry, near Maidstone, (_ante_, p. 173),\r\nand figured and described by me as _Abies Benstedi_, probably belongs\r\nto the coniferæ of the Wealden, since it was associated with drifted\r\nbones of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nFossil Cypresses.--The tribe of conifers called _Cupressus_ or Cypress,\r\n(distinguished from the firs and pines by the leaves being mere scales,\r\nand the cones consisting of small wooded peltate bracteæ, and by other\r\nbotanical characters,) including the Juniper and Arbor-vitæ, appears to\r\nhave flourished during the whole of the secondary epochs; for fossil\r\nleaves and stems referable to this family, but whose generic affinities\r\ncannot be determined with precision, have been found in the Trias,\r\nLias, Oolite, and Wealden deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 62.\r\n\r\nThuites Kurrianus _nat._\r\n\r\n_Wealden.

Many years since I discovered\r\nvestiges of branches and leaves of some species of this genus, in the\r\nironstone of the Wealden beds, at Heathfield in Sussex (_Geol. S. E._\r\np. 228); and of late, many specimens have been found in strata of\r\nthe same formation in England and Germany. The branch here figured,\r\nfrom the cabinet of S. H. Beckles, Esq. will serve to illustrate\r\nthe appearance of these fossil plants. Some small fruits found in\r\nthe ironstone of Heathfield may possibly belong to Cypresses. The\r\nfoliage and fruit of five or six distinct species of Thuites have been\r\ndiscovered in Tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nVoltzia.[153] (_Wond._ p. 547).--This extinct genus of plants is\r\npeculiar to the Trias (_Grès bigarré_) or New Red deposits, and is\r\none of the most characteristic of the fossil coniferæ. The specimens\r\nfirst found were from _Sultz-les-Bains_, near Strasburgh. The leaves\r\nare alternate, arranged spirally, sessile, and decurrent, and have\r\nmuch analogy with those of certain Araucariæ. The fruits are oblong\r\ncones, with cuneiform scales, slightly imbricated, not contiguous, and\r\ngenerally with from three to five lobes.\r\n\r\n[153] Named in honour of the late M. Voltz, of Strasburgh, by whom they\r\nwere first discovered. The specimens in the British Museum, from my\r\ncollection, were presented to me by M. Voltz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TAXITES. NŒGGERATHIA.

(See _ante_, p. 145.)\r\n\r\nNœggerathia.[154]--I must briefly notice the coal-plants which M.\r\nBrongniart has placed under this genus, because the foliage of some\r\nspecies appears to have entered largely into the formation of certain\r\nseams of coal, although the perfect form of the leaves is unknown.\r\nThe foliage referred to Nœggerathia consist of pinnated, or deeply\r\npinnatifid, simple leaves. These leaves, or leaflets, are either\r\nelongated, linear, lanceolate, wedge-shaped or flabelliform, and\r\nentire, or deeply lobed at their extremity, and are traversed by\r\nnumerous, fine, equal nerves, slightly diverging from the base, but\r\nalmost parallel. The affinities of these plants are not satisfactorily\r\nmade out: M. Brongniart considers them to approach nearest to the\r\nCycads or Conifers; perhaps forming a connecting tribe between those\r\ntwo great groups of gymnosperms.[155]\r\n\r\n[154] A leaf of _N. flabellata_ is figured in Foss.

When the tunnel was carried\r\nthrough Highgate Hill, in 1811, concretionary lumps of a brittle\r\nsubstance were discovered, which proved, upon analysis, to be the\r\nresin of a coniferous tree changed by mineralization. In a bed of\r\nfossil wood, near Hythe, in Kent, a resin was found that partook\r\nof the properties of amber and retinasphalt; it was of a clear red\r\ncolour, very infusible, and acted upon with difficulty by many chemical\r\nsolvents.[156]\r\n\r\n[156] Geological Proceedings, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe pollen of pines or firs occurs in a tertiary deposit at Egra, in\r\nBohemia; this bed is entirely composed of pollen and the frustules of\r\nmany kinds of diatomaceæ.[157]\r\n\r\n[157] Described by M.

FOSSIL PALMS.]\r\n\r\n_Amber_, so remarkable for its electrical properties, and so largely\r\nused for ornamental purposes, is a fossil resin, the product of an\r\nextinct species of pine (_Pinus succinifer_), which, though nearly\r\nallied to _Pinus abies_, and _P. picea_, is essentially distinct.\r\nThe Amber in the European markets is principally collected from the\r\nshores of the Baltic, between Memel and Konigsberg, being washed out of\r\nsubmerged beds of lignite, and thrown up on the strand by the waves.\r\nAmber is occasionally found on the eastern and northern shores of\r\nEngland. The forests of Amber-pines appear to have been situated in\r\nthe south-eastern part of what is now the bed of the Baltic, in about\r\n55° north latitude, and 37° to 38° east longitude, and were probably\r\ndestroyed at the commencement of the Drift period.\r\n\r\nInsects, spiders, small crustaceans, leaves, and fragments of vegetable\r\ntissue, are often imbedded in amber; and a few hairs and feathers of\r\nmammalia and birds have been detected. These organic bodies must have\r\nbecome immersed in this substance when it exuded from the trees in a\r\nviscid state, for they are often preserved as fresh and beautiful as\r\nif recently embalmed in the liquid resin. Upwards of 800 species of\r\ninsects have been discovered, chiefly referable to Aptera, Diptera,\r\nNeuroptera, Coleoptera, Libellula, &c.: by far the greater number\r\nbelong to extinct forms.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable remains comprise four species of pine, and species of\r\ncedar, cypress, juniper, yew; and of oak, poplar, beech, ash, &c.; and\r\na few ferns, mosses, liverworts, confervæ, and fungi. The Amber appears\r\nto have exuded from the bark and wood, but chiefly from the root-stock,\r\nas is the case with the _Copal_ and _Animé_, which are resinous\r\nsubstances obtained from certain trees in India and America, and\r\nlargely employed for varnish: these resins are often substituted for\r\ntrue amber, especially when they contain insects, &c.; but the latter\r\nare always of the existing indigenous species of the country. The\r\ndifference observable in the colour of the various species of amber, is\r\nattributable to accidental chemical admixtures.[158]\r\n\r\n[158] Petrifactions, p. 23.\r\n\r\nFossil Palms (_Palmacites_).--Reserving an account of the fossil\r\nplants belonging to the other grand division of Dicotyledons, the\r\n_Angiosperms_ (_ante_, p. 61), for the last section of the present\r\nchapter, I proceed to notice the most important family of the\r\n_Endogens_, or _Monocotyledons_, whose remains occur abundantly in many\r\ntertiary deposits--the Palms.\r\n\r\nThe Palms are, for the most part, lofty trees, having a single\r\ncylindrical stem, which, like that of the arborescent ferns, rises to\r\na great height, and is crowned with a canopy of foliage. The trunks\r\nare solid, most dense on the outer part, and in some species (as the\r\nCane-palms) are coated with a thin siliceous epidermis. At a little\r\ndistance above the surface of the ground, strong, simple, rope-like\r\nroots are sent off from the stem, appearing like clusters of stays or\r\nbraces to support the trunk; and the base of the petrified palm-trees\r\noften exhibits vestiges of these organs.[159] The leaves are supported\r\nby petioles, and are in most species very large;[160] they are either\r\npinnated or flabellated (fan-shaped), and sometimes nearly split\r\nin half: the veins or nervures are parallel, and the interspaces\r\nplaited like the folds of a fan. The surface of the stem is scored\r\nby transverse scars formed by the separation of the petioles, and\r\nthese markings assist in the identification of the fossil trunks\r\nof palm-trees. The fruit is in some kinds a single drupe, as the\r\nCocoa-nut; in others a cluster of soft pericarps, as the Date.\r\n\r\n[159] Specimens in the Brit. Mus. Petrifactions, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[160] In the Fan-palm (_Corypha_), the leaf is sometimes twenty feet\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThe Palm family is divided into upwards of sixty genera, comprising\r\nmore than a thousand species: the greater number are inhabitants of\r\ntropical countries. Stems, with the external surface and internal\r\nstructure preserved, and the foliage, and fruit, of several kinds of\r\nPalms, have been found in a fossil state, and chiefly in the Tertiary\r\nformations. Examples of the large silicified palm-stems from the\r\nWest India Islands, where they occur imbedded with corals petrified\r\nin the same manner, are to be seen in the British Museum,[161] and\r\nmost public collections: and sliced polished sections, exhibiting\r\nthe monocotyledonous structure, are common in private cabinets. The\r\nendogenous organization of the stems is so obvious as to leave no doubt\r\nas to the class to which the trees belong, but M. Brongniart states,\r\nthat, in the absence of the foliage and fruit, it is seldom possible to\r\npronounce with certainty that a fossil monocotyledonous stem belongs to\r\na Palm; for the internal structure alone does not enable the botanist\r\nto fix upon any characters which will distinguish the stems of Palms\r\nfrom those of Pandanus, Agave, Yucca, Aloes, Dracæna, &c. Fossil\r\nmonocotyledons known by their stems only, are therefore arranged by M.\r\nBrongniart under the general name of _Endogenites_.\r\n\r\n[161] Petrifactions, p. 52.\r\n\r\nThe _Palmacites carbonigenus_ of Corda, and other supposed palm-trees\r\nof the Coal formation, are regarded by the same eminent botanist as\r\nessentially differing in structure from this family, and belonging to\r\nan extinct tribe of exogens.\r\n\r\nThat a large proportion of the exogenous stems found in the Tertiary\r\ndeposits are true palms, there can, however, be no doubt, for the\r\nfoliage and fruit, which are occasionally associated with them, confirm\r\nthe inference drawn from the characters of the trunks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PALM LEAVES.]\r\n\r\nStems, leaves, and fruits of Palms have been discovered in the Paris\r\nbasin, by M. Ad. Brongniart (_Bd._ pl. lxiv. p. 515); and silicified\r\ntrunks in many other places on the Continent; but no fossils of this\r\nkind surpass in beauty and interest those which are found in the West\r\nIndies. A slice of a silicified stem from Antigua is represented, as\r\nseen by reflected light, in _Plate V. fig. 1_; it admirably displays\r\nbundles of vessels imbedded in cellular tissue.\r\n\r\nSilicified stems of monocotyledons, related to the Palms, are very\r\nwidely distributed, and have been collected among mammalian remains in\r\nAva, and in the Sub-Himalaya mountains.\r\n\r\nFossil Palm-leaves.--The pinnated and fan-shaped leaves of the Palms\r\nare so peculiar as to be easily recognized in a fossil state. Though\r\nmany specimens have been found in the tertiary strata of the Continent,\r\nbut two or three examples have been met with in England. The first\r\ndiscovered British specimen is in my cabinet, and was obtained by\r\nMr. Fowlstone, of Ryde, from the fresh-water limestone of Whitecliff\r\nBay, in the Isle of Wight. It is thirteen inches in length, and\r\neleven in width: fresh-water shells and plants are imbedded with it.\r\nIt is figured in Geol. I. of Wight, _2d edit._ p. 431. This species\r\n(_Palmacites Lamanonis_) occurs also at Aix in Provence, in great\r\nperfection, associated with Insects, Fishes, fresh-water shells, &c.\r\n(_Wond._ p. 260. _Petrif._ p. 62).\r\n\r\nTwelve species of palm-leaves are enumerated by M. Unger, from the\r\nTertiary deposits of the Continent. One species has been found in\r\nthe Chalk formation of Silesia; the most ancient strata in which the\r\nremains of undoubted palms have as yet been observed.\r\n\r\nThe fossil palm-leaves of the pinnated form are named _Phœnicites_,[FF]\r\nand examples occur in the Tertiary grits of Puy en Velais, I am not\r\naware that leaves of this type have been found in England: diligent\r\nresearch in our tertiary leaf-beds (at Whitecliff Bay, Alum Bay,\r\nBournemouth, Wareham) will probably sooner or later discover them. The\r\nleaflets have a well-marked median nerve, with fine nervures running\r\nparallel with it; a character by which the foliage of _Phœnicites_ may\r\nbe distinguished from that of the Cycadeæ.\r\n\r\n[162] From _Phœnix dactylifera_: the Date-Palm.\r\n\r\nFossil Fruits of Palms.--Although certain fruits found in the\r\ncoal-measures have been referred to the palm-tribe by M. Unger, Dr.\r\nLindley, and other botanists, M. Brongniart is of opinion that no such\r\nidentification can be established; the same remark applies to the\r\nCarpolithes from the Oolite; in fine, the Tertiary deposits have alone\r\nyielded fruits that can be unquestionably referred to plants of this\r\norder. The most productive British locality of fossil fruits of Palms,\r\nand of many other vegetables, is the Island of Sheppey; and I purpose\r\ndescribing in this place, not only the remains of this family, but also\r\nof the other plants associated with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FRUITS OF THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.]\r\n\r\nFossil Fruits of the Isle of Sheppey.--This little island, which is\r\nsituated in the mouth of the Thames, is entirely composed of the\r\nLondon Clay, with bands of septaria. On the north, there is a range\r\nof cliffs, about two hundred feet high, which is being continually\r\nundermined by the waves, and large masses of the clay are thrown down,\r\nand innumerable fruits, seeds, branches and stems of trees, and other\r\nfossils, are exposed on the strand at low-water. The vegetables are\r\nstrongly impregnated with iron pyrites, and as this mineral speedily\r\ndecomposes when exposed to the atmosphere, the choicest examples often\r\nfall to pieces, even when preserved in the cabinet.[163] The nodular\r\nmasses of indurated clay, termed septaria, contain the best preserved\r\nand most durable fossils. The fossil fruits, or carpolithes, occur\r\nin such profusion, that a large collection can easily be made; they\r\ncomprise several hundred species, few of which have been scientifically\r\ninvestigated.[164]\r\n\r\n[163] Mr. Bowerbank, who possesses an unrivalled collection of these\r\nfruits, keeps them in stopper-bottles filled with water, placing\r\nthe different species separately, and labelling the phials. I have\r\nsuccessfully employed mastic varnish, first wiping the specimens dry,\r\nand removing any saline efflorescence by means of raw cotton, and then\r\nbrushing in the varnish with a stiff hair-pencil.\r\n\r\n[164] See vol. ii. Excursion to the Isle of Sheppey.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkinson has given admirable figures of several of the Sheppey\r\nfruits, particularly of the large palm-like nuts, called \"_petrified\r\nfigs_\" (_Org. Rem._ vol. i. pl. vi. vii. _Pict. Atlas_, pl. vi. vii.)\r\nM. Ad. Brongniart has named several in his _Prodrome_; but without\r\nfigures the descriptions are useless to the student. Mr. Bowerbank\r\nhas published two numbers of a work entitled, \"_History of the Fossil\r\nFruits of the London Clay_,\" with seventeen plates; from which I have\r\nselected a few subjects for illustration. The fruits described are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  1. Fruits having a downy structure, like the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\n  2. _Cucumites._ Seeds of plants of the cucumber family. _Lign._\r\n       63, _fig._ 1 and 3. These fossil fruits so closely resemble\r\n       the seeds of various members of the recent genus _Cucumis_,\r\n       or Cucumber, comprising the Gourd, Water-melon, &c., both in\r\n       outward form and internal structure, that there is no reasonable\r\n       doubt of their belonging to plants of the same family; hence the\r\n       name _Cucumites_ or fossil cucumbers.\r\n\r\n  3. Cones of a tree allied to the genus _Petrophila_, of New\r\n       Holland. _Lign._ 63, _figs._ 2 and 8.\r\n\r\n  4. Seeds of the Bean family, some of which resemble those of the\r\n       common Scarlet-runner. _Lign._ 63. _figs._ 5, 6, 7.\r\n\r\n  5. _Wetherellia_; pulpy fruits divided into two lobes by the\r\n       expansion of the ripe seeds. As the section thus exposed bears\r\n       some resemblance to a coffee-berry, these fossils are popularly\r\n       called petrified coffee-berries. This genus has no known living\r\n       representative. _Lign. 63, fig. 4_.\r\n\r\n  6. Fruits allied to the Palm tribe. (_Nipadites_). _Lign._ 63,\r\n       _fig._ 9, and 10.\r\n\r\n  7.

Atlas_, pl. vi. vii.)--The most\r\nremarkable fruits in the above catalogue are those which, from their\r\nappearance when compressed, are known to collectors by the name of\r\n\"_petrified figs_\" (_Lign. 63, fig. 9, 10_). Some specimens attain\r\na considerable size, and are from five to seven inches long. The nut,\r\nand the pericarp or shell, are often well preserved. These fossils were\r\nreferred to the _Cocos_ by Mr. Parkinson, but they have not a ligneous\r\nendocarp with three pores as in the Cocoa-nut.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowerbank has shown that they are nearly related to the fruit of\r\nthe Nipa, or Molucca-Palm, a tree which abounds in Bengal, and in the\r\nMolucca and Philippine Islands. The Nipæ are low, shrub-like plants,\r\nhaving the general aspect of palms; they grow in marshy tracts, at the\r\nmouths of great rivers, particularly where the waters are brackish.\r\nThey are allied to the Cocoa-nut tribe, on the one hand, and to the\r\n_Pandanus_, or Screw-pine, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe _Nipadites_, according to Mr. Bowerbank, have the epicarp and\r\nendocarp thin and membranous, and the sarcocarp thick and pulpy, and\r\ncomposed of cellular tissue, through which run numerous bundles of\r\nvessels. Nearly in the centre of the pericarp is situated a large\r\nseed which, when broken, is more or less hollow. This seed consists\r\nof regular layers of cells, radiating from a spot situated near the\r\nmiddle, and apparently inclosing a central embryo.\r\n\r\nThe same author remarks, that \"if the habits of the plants to which\r\nthe fossil fruits belonged were similar to those of the recent _Nipa_,\r\nit will account for their abundance in the London Clay in the Isle of\r\nSheppey; which formation, from the great variety of stems and branches,\r\nmixed up with star-fishes, shells of mollusks, and bones of fishes,\r\ncrustaceans, and reptiles of numerous marine and fresh-water genera,\r\nis strikingly characteristic of the delta of a river, which probably\r\nflowed from near the Equator towards the spot where these interesting\r\nrelics are deposited.\" The fact that the seed-vessels of several\r\nspecies of Nipadites abound in the Isle of Sheppey, and have not been\r\nobserved in any other locality in England, tends to support this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nCarpolithes of this kind occur in great perfection in the Eocene\r\nstrata of Belgium, and were figured and described, nearly seventy\r\nyears since, in Burton's \"_Oryctographie de Bruxelles_,\" as petrified\r\ncocoa-nuts; the uncompressed state in which these fossils occur makes\r\nthe resemblance to the recent fruit more striking than in the flattened\r\npyritous specimens from the clay of Sheppey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NIPADITES OF BELGIUM.]\r\n\r\nThe _Nipadites_ of Brussels have recently been brought under the more\r\nimmediate notice of English geologists, in a memoir \"On the Tertiary\r\nStrata of Belgium and French Flanders,\" by Sir Charles Lyell, in\r\nwhich several specimens are figured and described.[165] These fossils\r\nare found in sands and sandstone, presumed to be of the age of the\r\nBracklesham beds of Sussex. They are procured from Schaerbeek, in the\r\nnorthern suburbs of Brussels, where extensive quarries are worked for\r\npaving-stones, and have long been celebrated for remains of turtles,\r\ntrunks of palms, and dicotyledonous trees, and the fruits, now called\r\nNipadites. The vegetable remains often occur silicified; Sir C. Lyell\r\nwas shown by the workmen \"the trunk of a petrified exogenous tree, with\r\nforty rings of annual growth; it had lain in a horizontal position, and\r\nwas bored by teredinæ. The silicified base of the trunk of a Palm-tree,\r\napparently broken off short at about the level of the soil, had\r\nnumerous air-roots, or rootlets, attached.\"[166]\r\n\r\n[165] Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. viii.\r\nAugust 1852.\r\n\r\n[166] \"On the Belgian Tertiary Formations,\" Geol.

Parkinsoni_ (_Pictorial\r\nAtlas_, plate vii.). These fossil nuts closely resemble the fruit of\r\n_Nipas fruticans_, a palm which abounds in the delta of the Ganges,\r\nand other parts of Bengal, and is the only living species of the\r\ngenus known.[167] In an immature or abortive specimen of _Nipadites\r\ngiganteus_ (of Bowerbank), figured in _Geol.

The largest specimen of Nipadites from\r\nSchaerbeek, is above seven inches long and four wide. The arenaceous\r\nstrata containing these fruits, and stems of palms and dicotyledonous\r\ntrees, are supposed to have been formed in the sea near the mouth of\r\na river, as in the case of the clay-beds at Sheppey: the vegetable\r\nremains are associated with bones of fresh-water Turtles, teeth of\r\nSharks, cases and spines of Echinoderms, and shells of the genera\r\nOstrea, Pinna, &c.[168]\r\n\r\n[167] \"On the Belgian Tertiary Formations,\" Geol.

As in the palms,\r\nthe stem is supported near the base by long side-roots, which enable\r\nthese trees to maintain an erect position, and flourish on the\r\nnewly-elevated coral-reefs, where but little soil has accumulated.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this tribe of plants during the secondary ages is\r\nknown only by a single example of a fossil fruit, which was discovered\r\nby Mr. Page, of Bishport, in the Inferior Oolite, to the east of\r\nCharmouth, Dorsetshire, and is preserved in the museum at Oxford; no\r\nvestiges of the stems or foliage have been observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 65.

Each cell contains a single seed, usually hexagonal, resembling\r\na small grain of rice, and is supported by a foot-stalk, formed of\r\ndense fibres; a character exhibited only by the seed-vessels of\r\nPandanus. The fossil fruit differs from that of the recent Screw-pines\r\nin the seeds being neither inclosed in a hard nut, nor collected into\r\ndrupes, but dispersed uniformly over the entire mass; this forms the\r\nessential generic distinction between them.

The tortuous channels excavated in the wood by\r\nthese borers, are lined or filled up with calcareous spar, indurated\r\nclay, or other mineral matter, of various shades of grey, blue, yellow,\r\n&c.; and the polished slabs of this fossil wood are beautifully\r\ndiversified by the sections of the sparry tubes, crossed at right\r\nangles by the ligneous structure; as in the specimen _fig. 1, Lign.\r\n65_, from the Canal in the Regent's Park.[169]\r\n\r\n[169] Slabs of this kind are generally kept by the lapidaries at Bognor,\r\nWorthing, &c. and sold at 2_s._ or 2_s._ 6_d._ each.\r\n\r\nIn the fossil, _fig. 2.

Until the\r\ninternal structure of these fossils has been examined, the correctness\r\nof this identification is, however, uncertain: the external\r\nresemblance to the stem of the Dracæna consists in the interrupted\r\nannular ridges, denoting amplexicaul leaves: no vestiges of the foliage\r\nhave been observed.\r\n\r\n[170] Petrifactions, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRESH-WATER PLANTS. FOSSIL CHARÆ.]\r\n\r\nFossil Fresh-water Plants.--The tertiary fresh-water strata often\r\ncontain abundance of the remains of the aquatic vegetables that\r\ninhabited the lakes and rivers in which those deposits were formed. The\r\nremains of several species of the common lacustrine plant, the _Chara_,\r\nare found in immense quantities in the fresh-water limestones and marls\r\nof the Isle of Wight, of the coast of Hampshire, and of the Paris\r\nBasin. The shell-marls, still in progress of formation in the lakes of\r\nScotland, and the travertine precipitated from thermal springs, in like\r\nmanner envelop and preserve the leaves and fruits of recent species.\r\n\r\nFossil Fruits of Chara. (_Gyrogonites._) _Lign. 66._--The Chara is a\r\nwell-known inhabitant of almost every stream and rivulet. The stems\r\nare hollow, and composed of tubes filled with a fluid in which green\r\nglobules circulate; they form beautiful microscopic objects for\r\nexhibiting the circulation in vegetables. The fruit consists of very\r\nsmall nuclei, contained in a calcareous pericarp, composed of five\r\nspirally twisted plates, that unite at the summit. These seed-vessels,\r\nwhen first discovered in a fossil state, were supposed to be the shells\r\nof mollusks, and a genus was formed for their reception with the name\r\nof _Gyrogonites_ (_twisted-stones_); a term still employed, though the\r\nvegetable nature of these bodies is well known. In _Plate III. fig. 5_,\r\na branch of the common Chara with seeds is represented: and figures\r\nof the seed-vessels, of two fossil species are given in _Lign. 66,\r\nfigs. 1, 2_.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the fossil fruits and stems of Charæ, may be collected\r\nin abundance in the fresh-water limestone at East Cliff Bay, Isle of\r\nWight.[171]\r\n\r\n[171] See my Geology of the Isle of Wight, _Lign. 5_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 66.

The bands of\r\nsiliceous sinter, which occur in the lowermost deposits, are especially\r\nrich in these remains.[172]\r\n\r\n[172] I am indebted to the Rev. Osmond Fisher, of Dorchester, for a fine\r\nsuite of these and other interesting fossils from the Purbeck beds of\r\nRidgway and Osmington, near Weymouth; and to William Shipp, Esq., of\r\nBlandford, and Edward Woodhouse, Esq., of Ansty, for many specimens\r\nfrom Durlstone Bay, and Ridgway.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Nympheæ._ _Lign. 66, fig. 4._--Those magnificent aquatic\r\nplants, the Water-Lilies (_Nympheæ_), that adorn our rivers and lakes\r\nwith flowers and foliage which partake more of the characters of\r\nan exotic flora than any other of our indigenous plants, are also\r\nfound fossil in the lacustrine marls and limestones of the tertiary\r\nformations of France; but the nature of these remains could only be\r\nrecognized by a profound botanist, for they consist of impressions of\r\nthe internal structure of the stems, which, however, is so peculiar,\r\nthat no reasonable doubt of their origin can be entertained. Two\r\nimprints on a piece of limestone from Lonjumeau, presented to me by the\r\nlate M. Alex. Brongniart, are figured in _Lign. 66, fig. 4_; some\r\nminute seed-vessels (_Lign. 66, fig. 3_), found with them, closely\r\nresemble those of _Nympheæ_, and are supposed to belong to the same\r\nplants (_Class. Vég. Foss._ p. 72).\r\n\r\nFossil Flowers.--The tertiary limestones of Monte Bolca (_Wond._ p.\r\n565), so rich in ichthyolites, and other fossil remains of great\r\ninterest, contain leaves, and even flowers, of liliaceous plants.\r\nThe specimen figured (_Lign. 67, fig. 3_) is in the Museum at\r\nParis, and described by M. Brongniart under the name of _Antholithes_\r\n(stone-flower) _liliaceus_; it consists of the corolla and calyx:\r\nthe anthers and pistils have not been observed in any example. The\r\ndiscovery of this fossil should excite the young collector to search\r\ndiligently for such objects in the tertiary strata of England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ANGIOSPERMS.]\r\n\r\nFossil Angiosperms.--The fossil remains of the class which constitutes\r\nthe grand features of the existing floras of most countries, the\r\n_Exogenous Angiosperms_, are now to be considered; and though our\r\nsurvey of fossil botany has partaken but little of a geological\r\narrangement, yet the reader may have observed, that a large proportion\r\nof the vegetables composing the floras of the ancient secondary\r\nformations, belonged to the Cryptogamous and Gymnospermous classes.\r\nA striking contrast is presented in the geological position of the\r\nmineralized dicotyledonous plants, of existing genera. These abound in\r\nthe tertiary strata, and generally in an inverse ratio to the antiquity\r\nof the deposit, while their remains are almost wholly absent in the\r\nolder rocks; neither have there been discovered in the Tertiary,\r\nany beds of vascular cryptogamia, at all approaching the immense\r\naccumulations in the Carboniferous formations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 67.

Flor. pl. cci. and is figured, Sil. Syst. p. 43.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, within the limits necessarily assigned to\r\nthese volumes, to offer even a general view of the fossil remains of\r\nthis grand class of vegetables; our remarks must be limited to a few\r\ninteresting examples and localities.\r\n\r\nWhen stems of dicotyledonous trees only are found, but little certainty\r\ncan be obtained as to the family to which they belonged; the foliage of\r\nmany well-known genera offer more positive characters; the flowers are\r\nrarely in a state of preservation to afford any valuable data; but the\r\nfruits, or seed-vessels, are frequently well preserved, and these may\r\nenable the botanist to arrive at precise determinations as to generic,\r\nand, perhaps, specific relations.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary marls of Aix, in Provence, which abound in insects,\r\ncrustaceans, and lacustrine shells, contain many kinds of\r\ndicotyledonous leaves, associated with those of palms. (_Wond._ p. 260.)\r\n\r\nThe Lignite, or Brown-coal deposits, are almost entirely composed of\r\ndicotyledonous trees, belonging to many genera, which are inhabitants\r\nof Europe; namely, the Poplar, Willow, Elm, Chestnut, Walnut, Sycamore,\r\nMaple, Linden, Buckthorn, Vine, &c. (_Bd._ vol. i. pp. 508-514.)\r\n\r\nThe beds of brown coal, on the banks of the Rhine, are literally\r\ncarbonized submerged forests, which in some remote period were drifted\r\nfrom the interior of the Continent into a vast lake or gulf; for the\r\ntrees bear evident marks of transport, and are destitute of roots and\r\nbranches. These masses resemble the rafts of forest trees, which are\r\ndaily floated down the Mississippi into the Atlantic, where they become\r\nengulfed in the profound depths of the ocean, and probably will be\r\nconverted into coal or lignite; and in future ages, may be elevated\r\nabove the waters, become dry land, and present to the then existing\r\ncommunities of mankind an inexhaustible supply of mineral fuel,\r\ncomposed of species and genera of plants, which possibly may then be\r\nextinct, and replaced by peculiar types of vegetation.\r\n\r\nFossil Flora of Œningen. (_Bd._ pp. 511-514).--The celebrated\r\nlacustrine tertiary formation of Œningen, whose fossil reptiles and\r\nmammalia we shall have to notice hereafter, contains a rich assemblage\r\nof dicotyledonous and gymnospermous ligneous vegetables, with a few\r\nferns and grasses. Not only branches and leaves of a species of\r\nVine[174] occur, but even the fruit; fossil grapes being found in these\r\ndeposits;[175] there are also many aquatic plants. A descriptive list\r\nof these fossils, by Professor Braun, of Carlsruhe, is given by Dr.\r\nBuckland. The brown-coal of this basin is in thin beds of but little\r\neconomical importance, but so rich in the vegetation of the miocene\r\ntertiary period, that a few days spent in collecting those treasures\r\nwill amply reward the intelligent tourist who may visit Constance. (See\r\n_Wond._ p. 263.)\r\n\r\n[174] See Knorr, Mon. des Catastrophes, pl. xxxviii. tom. i.\r\n\r\n[175] Fossil grapes from the lignite of Œningen were exhibited by Dr.\r\nDaubeny at a late meeting of the Geological Society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DICOTYLEDONOUS LEAVES.]\r\n\r\nThe foliage of dicotyledonous trees frequently occurs in the Eocene\r\nmarls and limestones, and in some localities in considerable abundance,\r\nand in beautiful preservation. Near Bournemouth, on the Hampshire\r\ncoast, the leaves of many species are met with in a bed of sandy\r\nmarl, between three and four feet thick: the vegetable substance\r\nis carbonized; some of the leaves are referable to the _Lauraceæ_\r\nand _Amentaceæ_, others to the _Characeæ_;[176] a similar deposit of\r\ntertiary plants has been discovered near Wareham. These beds belong to\r\nthe lower group of the Hampshire Basin.[177]\r\n\r\n[176] Geol. Proc. vol. iii. p. 592.\r\n\r\n[177] As the seed-vessels and other vegetable remains in the Isle\r\nof Sheppey are all of a tropical character, while those found in\r\nthe Eocene strata of Alum Bay, Bournemouth, and Newhaven, are of a\r\ntemperate climate, as Nerium, Platanus, &c., Prof. E. Forbes infers\r\nthat the former were transported from distant lands by currents, and\r\nthat the latter belong to the true flora of the country inhabited by\r\nthe Palæotheria and other associated mammalia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 68.

S. E._ p. 54), contains leaves of a\r\nsimilar kind; a seed-vessel of a coniferous tree has also been found in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting examples of dicotyledonous leaves\r\nthat have come under my notice, are from the Sub-Apennine tertiary\r\nstrata, at Stradella, near Pavia. They belong to several genera of\r\narborescent, or at least ligneous plants, and most of them to species\r\nwhich still grow in Italy. In some examples the substance of the\r\nleaves is changed into carbon, and the structure well preserved; but,\r\nin general, sharp imprints on the stone are the only traces of the\r\noriginals. They are found in a gypseous marl, of a cream colour; and,\r\nfrom their perfect state, it is inferred that they were enveloped in\r\nthe soft matrix immediately after their fall, and preserved by the\r\nrapid crystallization of the gypsum. Two specimens from my cabinet are\r\nfigured in _Plate III._ _figs._ 4 and 8; and outlines of a few other\r\nexamples, in _Lign. 68_.\r\n\r\nCarpolithes (_Fossil Fruits_).--In the description of the fossil\r\nfruits from the Isle of Sheppey, several kinds of dicotyledons were\r\nincluded. Many species also abound in the lignites of Germany, France,\r\nand Italy; in those near Frankfort, seed-vessels of the Maple, Elm,\r\nHornbeam, Birch, Willow, and Walnut, &c. In the environs of Turin,\r\nfruits of a species of Walnut (_Juglans_, _Lign. 67_), occur in the\r\nnewer tertiary deposits, and are called Turin-nuts; the ligneous\r\nenvelope has perished, but the form of its surface, and of the inclosed\r\nkernel, is preserved in calcareous spar. These nuts differ, both in\r\nthe pericarp and kernel, from the living species: the lobes are simple\r\n(_Lign. 67, fig. 4^b_), and not subdivided as in the common walnut;\r\na species has been discovered at Lons-le-Saulnier, in which the lobes\r\nare mamillated.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of fruits belonging to plants of the order _Ranunculaceæ_,\r\nand related to _Thalictrum_ (_Meadow-rue_), have been found in the\r\neocene deposits of France and England; one in the Paris basin,\r\n(_meulière du terrain d'eau douce supérieur_,) by M. Alexandre\r\nBrongniart, and the other in the Isle of Wight, by Mr. Webster. In the\r\nspecimen from the last-named locality the pericarp is carbonized, and\r\nits cavity filled with clay. Figures of these seed-vessels are given in\r\n_Lign. 67, figs. 1, 2_.\r\n\r\nCarpolithes Smithiæ.--I would notice in this place some very\r\nremarkable fossil fruits that are occasionally met with in the White\r\nChalk of Sussex and Kent, and appear to belong to dicotyledonous trees.\r\nThe first specimen was discovered by me in a chalk-pit near Lewes, and\r\nis described in my \"Fossils of the South Downs:\" some illustrative\r\nexamples collected by Mrs Smith, of Tunbridge Wells, tending to\r\nelucidate the nature of the original more satisfactorily than those\r\nin my collection, are figured and described by me in the Journal of\r\nthe Geological Society, 1843, under the above name. These fruits are\r\nof an oval form, about one and a half inch long, and one inch wide,\r\nand are pressed almost flat. They are of a rich burnt-sienna colour,\r\nmottled with white, from the chalk having permeated their substance,\r\nand are studded over with slight eminences, which are the exposed\r\nsummits of oblong flattened seeds. Although the internal structure is\r\nnot preserved, there can be no doubt that the originals were spurious\r\ncompound berries, having, like the Mulberry, the seeds imbedded in a\r\nsoft pulpy mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL DICOTYLEDONOUS TREES.]\r\n\r\nFossil Dicotyledonous Trees.--The occurrence of trunks and branches of\r\nangiospermous trees in a carbonized state has already been described;\r\nlike the monocotyledons and conifers, they also occur silicified.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful specimens I have seen are from the Lybian and\r\nEgyptian deserts, and were collected by my friend, the late Colonel\r\nHead. In these the most delicate vascular tissue is permeated by\r\nchalcedony and jasper, and the vessels are filled with silex of a\r\nbright vermilion and blue colour, while the cellular structure is of a\r\nrich yellow. Fragments of these fossil trees are scattered everywhere\r\namong the sands of the desert; the most interesting locality is an\r\nirregular plateau, which reposes on marine limestone, considerably\r\nabove the level of the Nile, about seven miles east by south from\r\nCairo. This district is called the _petrified forest_, from the immense\r\nquantities of silicified trees with which it is covered. It is thus\r\ngraphically described by a late traveller:--\r\n\r\n\"Having passed the tombs of the Caliphs, just beyond the gates of\r\nCairo, we proceed to the southward nearly at right angles to the road,\r\nacross the Desert to Suez: and after travelling some ten miles up a\r\nlow barren valley covered with sand, gravel, and sea-shells, fresh\r\nas if the tide had retired but yesterday, we cross a low range of\r\nsand-hills, which has for some distance run parallel to our path. The\r\nscene now presented is beyond conception singular and desolate. Heaps\r\nof fragments of large trees converted into stone everywhere meet the\r\neye, and when struck by our horses' hoofs rang like cast iron; they\r\nextend for miles in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest; and the\r\nappearance is so natural, that were it in Scotland or Ireland, it would\r\npass without remark as a drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay\r\nrotting in the sun. The roots, and rudiments of the branches, are in\r\nmany cases nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the\r\nbark are distinctly recognizable.\"[178]\r\n\r\n[178] Bombay Times.\r\n\r\nMany of the trunks are scattered over the surface, among rolled and\r\nangular fragments of dark grit, and pebbles of jasper,[179] chert,\r\nand quartz. The large trunks occur in great numbers on dark-coloured\r\nknolls, where they lie, like the broken stems of a prostrate forest,\r\ncrossing each other at various angles. Two of the largest measured\r\nrespectively forty-eight, and sixty feet in length, and two and\r\na half, and three feet in diameter, at the base. With but two or\r\nthree exceptions, all the specimens examined microscopically, are\r\ndicotyledons. No traces of seed-vessels or leaves have been detected.\r\n\r\n[179] The jaspers are known to lapidaries as _Egyptian Pebbles_.\r\n\r\nThe situation and condition of these petrified forests, indicate great\r\nchanges in the relative position of the land and sea in that part of\r\nEgypt; for the trees must have grown on the dry land formed by the\r\nelevated bottom of a former ocean; which must have subsided, and been\r\ncovered by beds of sand and pebbles; another elevatory movement must\r\nhave raised the entire series of deposits to their present situation,\r\nand the retiring waters have removed the loose portions of the last\r\nformed strata, and dispersed them, with fragments of the silicified\r\ntrees, over the surface of the Egyptian and Lybian deserts.[180]\r\n\r\n[180] See a Memoir on the Geology of Egypt, Geol. Proc. vol. iii. p.\r\n782; and on the Petrified Forest near Cairo, vol. iv. p. 349, by Lieut.\r\nNewbold, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DICOTYLEDONOUS OF THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH.]\r\n\r\nDicotyledons of the Cretaceous Epoch.--Among the crowd of interesting\r\nfacts relating to the botanical character of the earlier periods of\r\ngeology which recent observations have brought to light, one discovery\r\ndemands especial notice, and I have reserved it for this place, rather\r\nthan introduce it in an earlier section.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle the lower members of the\r\nCretaceous formation, viz. the Greensand, Galt, and Chalk-marl, are\r\nwell developed, and comprise a series of littoral deposits of the\r\ngreat Chalk ocean that extended westwardly between France and England,\r\non both sides of the existing Channel, and eastwardly over North and\r\nCentral Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Russia, far into Asia. The series\r\nof strata at Aix-la-Chapelle is several hundred feet in thickness, and\r\nthe lowermost beds lie immediately on the Carboniferous rocks of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nDr. M. H. Debey,[181] to whose scientific labours we are indebted for an\r\naccurate knowledge of these interesting facts, divides these cretaceous\r\ndeposits into four groups, the lowermost of which appears to be the\r\nequivalent of our Greensand; it consists of beds of clay and sand, the\r\nmiddle portion abounding in stems, leaves, and fruit, and the resin of\r\nconiferous trees.\r\n\r\n[181] See Geol. Journal, vol. vii. p. 109.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis of the leaves often occurs in a carbonized state, and is\r\nrecognizable by its microscopic structure. Xylophagous mollusks are\r\nfound in the petrified and carbonized wood. Fresh-water Desmidiaceæ,\r\nand a few marine remains, are associated with this fossil flora, which\r\nis distinguished by the abundance of Ferns and dicotyledonous leaves,\r\nand the scarcity of Cycads; among them are undoubted _Proteaceæ_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens collected by M. Debey from the lower cretaceous beds are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\nAlgæ, 15. Filices, 28. Hydropteridæ, 2. Cycadeæ, 5. Naiadeæ, 5. Palmæ,\r\n1. Coniferæ, 20. Julifloræ, 5. Credneriæ, 3.

XV.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT OF FOSSIL BOTANY.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RETROSPECT OF FOSSIL BOTANY.]\r\n\r\nIf we pass from the consideration of details of structure, and of\r\nbotanical affinities, to a general survey of the mineralized remains of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, we perceive that from the palæozoic deposits,\r\nto those which are contemporaneous with the human race,--from the\r\ncoal-measures to the peat-bogs of modern times,--vast accumulations\r\nof vegetable matter, in various states of carbonization, have\r\nbeen produced from the imbedded relics of the terrestrial floras\r\nthat flourished during the respective periods of their formation;\r\npetrifaction, or the transmutation of vegetable tissues into stone,\r\nfrom the infiltration of siliceous, calcareous, or metallic solutions,\r\nbeing an accidental process, dependent on the physical conditions under\r\nwhich the trees and plants were submerged, and entombed in the strata.\r\n\r\nAlthough the entire system of vegetable life which prevailed during\r\nthe earlier ages of the world is but partially revealed by the fossil\r\nremains which geological researches have brought under the examination\r\nof the naturalist,--for numerous tribes of plants may have existed\r\nof which no traces have been detected, while of species of delicate\r\ntissues all vestiges may have perished,--yet a review of the facts\r\nhitherto obtained, presents some highly important and unexpected\r\nresults, as to the characters of the successive floras which prevailed\r\nduring the palæozoic, secondary, and tertiary epochs. And though\r\ndeductions of this nature must, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nbe regarded in the light of shifting hypotheses to be modified or\r\nabandoned with the progress of discovery,--yet the predominating types\r\nwhich characterize the flora of one system of formations, differ so\r\nessentially from those of another, that it may be reasonably inferred\r\nsuch apparent distinctions are the effect of organic laws, and not\r\nillusions arising from our misinterpretation of the natural records of\r\nformer conditions of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nThe absence in the most ancient deposits of the entire class of\r\nAngiosperms, or flowering plants, which constitutes the leading\r\nfeatures of the floras with which we are familiar,--the abundance of\r\nunknown types of Cryptogamia, and the extinction or disappearance of\r\nthose tribes in the succeeding formations, and the prevalence of new\r\nspecies and genera belonging to another class;--the predominance in\r\none flora, both in number and variety, of certain tribes, and their\r\ndecadence in the next period; while a family subordinate in the\r\nantecedent epoch, and known but by a small number of species, suddenly\r\nacquires a pre-eminence both in numbers and variety;--are phenomena,\r\nwhich the facts brought before us in the course of this argument,\r\npresent in a striking point of view.\r\n\r\nAssuming these data as the basis of a philosophical generalization,\r\nM. Brongniart arranges the known species of fossil plants into three\r\ngrand systems, which correspond with the great geological periods,\r\ncomprehended in the palæozoic, secondary, and tertiary formations.\r\n\r\nThe first or most ancient flora is characterized by the predominance of\r\n_Cryptogamic Acrogens_--the _Ferns_ and _Club-mosses_; the second by\r\nthe large development of the _Dicotyledonous Gymnosperms_--the _Cycads_\r\nand _Conifers_: the third by the appearance and prevalence of the\r\n_Angiosperms_, both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous. The following\r\ntable presents a concise view of the results of M. Brongniart's\r\ninvestigation.[184]\r\n\r\n[184] For details, and a masterly review of the subject, the original\r\nMemoir must be consulted.

Thus, in the two first, both Acrogens and Gymnosperms existed;\r\nbut in the first period the former greatly exceeded the latter, both\r\nin number and magnitude; while in the next the Gymnosperms acquired the\r\nascendancy; but in both these epochs, from the Devonian to the Wealden\r\ninclusive, very few if any Angiosperms, or flowering dicotyledons,\r\nexisted. With the Cretaceous period the Angiosperms appear in great\r\nnumbers, and in the Tertiary epochs acquire the importance they possess\r\nin the existing floras.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of the flora of the Carboniferous epoch, by M.\r\nBrongniart, will exemplify these remarks.[185]\r\n\r\n[185] See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. pp. 726-733, for an account of\r\nthe Carboniferous floras and deposits.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF THE CARBONIFEROUS FLORA\r\n\r\n  Cryptogamia (_Amphigens_).

It has been\r\nsuggested that the greater or lesser durability of the foliage of\r\ncertain vegetables, may have occasioned their presence or absence in\r\nthe carboniferous deposits, and experiments were instituted by Dr.\r\nLindley with the view of determining this question. But though it was\r\nfound that, when the foliage of various families was subjected to\r\nlong maceration, the leaves of dicotyledons and grasses disappeared,\r\nwhile those of ferns and cycads remained, this fact does not meet the\r\nexigencies of the case, for we have no evidence to show that the fossil\r\nleaves were ever placed in similar conditions; on the contrary, there\r\nis reason to conclude that they were imbedded under circumstances that\r\narrested the usual progress of decomposition, prevented the escape\r\nof the hydrogen and other gaseous elements, and gave rise to the\r\nbituminous fermentation by which they were converted into lignite and\r\ncoal; and we have no proof that, had grasses been associated with the\r\nferns, they would not have undergone a similar change. Moreover, there\r\nare countries in which the ferns now assume the numerical proportion of\r\nthe grasses of other latitudes; for example. New Zealand, which also\r\npresents in its fauna a striking analogy to that of the carboniferous\r\ndeposits, in the almost entire absence of indigenous mammalia; one\r\nspecies of Rat being the only known living quadruped.\r\n\r\n[187] See Mr. Morris's Catalogue of British Fossils.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Dr. Dieffenbach remarks, that \"although in its flora\r\nNew Zealand has some relationship with the two large continents between\r\nwhich it is situated, America and Australia, and even possesses some\r\nspecies identical with those of Europe, without the Latter being\r\nreferable to an introduction by Europeans, yet the greater number of\r\nspecies, and even genera, are peculiar to it. New Zealand, with the\r\nadjacent islands, Chatham, Auckland, and Macquarrie, forms a botanical\r\ncentre. It is sufficiently distant from both continents to preserve\r\nits botanical peculiarities, and it offers the most striking instance\r\nof an acknowledged fact in all branches of natural history, viz. that\r\nthe different regions of the globe are endowed with peculiar forms of\r\nanimal and vegetable life. The number of species of plants at present\r\nknown is 632, of which 314 are dicotyledonous, and the rest, or 318,\r\nare monocotyledonous and cellular. The monocotyledons are few in\r\ncomparison with the cellular plants, for there are but seventy-six\r\nspecies. The grasses have given way to ferns, for the ferns and\r\nfern-like plants are by far the most abundant in New Zealand, and cover\r\nimmense districts. They _replace the Gramineæ_ of other countries, and\r\ngive a character to all the open land of the hills and plains. Some\r\nof the arborescent kinds grow to thirty feet and more in height, and\r\nthe variety and elegance of their forms, from the minutest species to\r\nthe most gigantic, are very remarkable.\"[188] In the accumulations of\r\nvegetable matter now in the progress of formation in the morasses,\r\nbays, and creeks of New Zealand, the remains of ferns largely\r\npredominate; and I am informed by my son,[189] that in the estuaries\r\nthey are associated with numerous shells of brachiopodous mollusca.\r\n\r\n[188] Dr. Dieffenbach's New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[189] Mr. Walter Mantell, of Wellington, New Zealand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nON COLLECTING BRITISH FOSSIL VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL VEGETABLES.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been advanced, the student will perceive that to obtain\r\nan illustrative collection of the fossil plants of Great Britain, many\r\ndifferent localities must be visited.\r\n\r\nThe fruits and stems of Palms, Conifers, and many dicotyledons, may be\r\ncollected in the Isle of Sheppey, and other places where the London\r\nClay is exposed. (See _Excursion to the Isle of Sheppey_, Part IV.)\r\nCycadeous stems and coniferous wood may be procured in the Isle of\r\nPortland; from the Wealden Cliffs along the southern shore of the Isle\r\nof Wight; and on the Sussex coast, from Bexhill, by St. Leonard's,\r\nto the east of Hastings. The foliage of several species of Zamiæ and\r\nferns, occur abundantly in the lower Oolite, along the Yorkshire coast,\r\nnear Scarborough, and at Gristhorpe Bay. The Lias of Lyme Regis,\r\nCharmouth, and their vicinity, affords stems and branches of coniferous\r\ntrees, and leaves of cycads.\r\n\r\nFerns, Sigillariæ, Calamites, and the usual plants of the carboniferous\r\nflora, may be found in every coal-mine; and the Devonian limestones\r\nof the South of Ireland yield ferns and Lepidodendra. In Forfarshire\r\nthe lower Devonian shales abound in the foliage of aquatic, apparently\r\nfluviatile, plants.[190]\r\n\r\n[190] See Memoir on the Telerpeton; Geol. Journ. vol. viii. p. 106.\r\n\r\nA list of some of the most productive British localities is subjoined.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the suggestions already given as to the mode of\r\ncollecting specimens, it may be necessary to state that the leaves in\r\nthe tertiary marls and clays are generally very delicate and friable,\r\nand liable to flake off in the state of a carbonaceous film. This may,\r\nin a great measure, be prevented by carefully covering them with a thin\r\ncoating either of mastic varnish, or gum-water, before they are placed\r\nin the cabinet. In extracting these specimens, a broad chisel will\r\nbe found the most convenient instrument. In searching for fossils in\r\ncoal-mines, the collector should remember that the ironstone nodules\r\noften contain beautiful examples of the leaves of ferns, and fruits of\r\nLepidodendra. These nodules, when of an oblong shape, should be split\r\nopen in a longitudinal direction, by a smart blow of a hammer, and the\r\ninclosed leaf will thus be exposed, as shown in _Lign. 3, figs. 2, 3_,\r\n_ante_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL VEGETABLES.]\r\n\r\n Allenbank, Berwickshire      _Carb._       Stems of Conifers, &c.\r\n\r\n Alum Bay, Isle of Wight      _Tert._     { Fruit, dicotyledonous leaves,\r\n                                          { lignite; Charge, stems and\r\n                                          { seed-vessels.\r\n\r\n Ashby-de-la-Zouch,         } _Carb._     { Coal plants in great abundance.\r\n   Leicestershire           }\r\n\r\n\r\n Bignor, Sussex             } _Cret._     } Fucoids.\r\n                            } _Firestone_ }\r\n\r\n\r\n Binstead Quarries, near    } _Tert._     { Charæ, stems and seed-vessels.\r\n   Ryde, Isle of Wight      }\r\n\r\n\r\n Blackdown, Devonshire        _Gr.

The true position of the Sponges in the\r\ngreat system of Creation is still a disputed point; for while many\r\ndistinguished naturalists regard them as _Protozoa_, or the lowest type\r\nof animal organization, others of equal eminence affirm that neither in\r\nstructure nor functions do they differ from vegetables in any essential\r\nparticular; and that if a line be drawn between the two kingdoms the\r\nPorifera must be placed on the vegetable side of the boundary. On\r\nthe other hand, Dr. George Johnston, in his delightful work on the\r\nBritish Zoophytes,[193] expresses his opinion that there is nothing to\r\ndiscountenance the belief that these bodies hold an intermediate place;\r\nthat they are, in fact, the true _Zoophytes_, or animal-plants; in some\r\nforms, as the green _Spongillæ_ of our lakes, the vegetable nature\r\nprevails; while in others, as the horny or keratose sponges filled\r\nwith mucilaginous slime, and the fleshy _Tethya_ whose oscula, or\r\npores, are said to exhibit signs of irritability, the animal character\r\npredominates.\r\n\r\n[193] A History of British Sponges, &c. by Dr. George Johnston,\r\nEdinburgh. 1843. One vol. 8vo. with twenty-five plates. A previous\r\nwork, \"A History of British Zoophytes,\" with forty-four plates, from\r\ndrawings by the accomplished lady of the Author, cannot be too highly\r\ncommended.\r\n\r\nWithout committing ourselves to either opinion, and simply remarking\r\nthat the large proportion of silex that enters into the tissues of\r\na considerable number of the porifera, is more characteristic of\r\nvegetable than of animal structures, we proceed to consider the fossil\r\nsponges and allied forms, as the mineralized remains of the lowest\r\ntypes of the animal kingdom: if the vegetable nature of the originals\r\nwere generally admitted, this section should have followed that which\r\ntreats of the Diatomaceæ (_ante_, p. 100).\r\n\r\nSponge consists of a reticulated fibrous mass, covered with numerous\r\npores of various sizes, which are connected internally by anastomosing\r\nchannels, and this tissue is surrounded by a cellular gelatinous\r\nmatter, by which the entire structure was secreted, and is, in fact,\r\nthe vital part of the zoophyte. The tough framework or skeleton is in\r\nsome kinds fibrous, horny, flexible, or rigid, and strengthened by\r\ncalcareous or siliceous spicula (_spines_);[194] while in other species\r\nits substance is calcareous, and in some siliceous, constituting a web\r\nof transparent rock crystal, resembling spun glass,[195] The gelatinous\r\nmatter lines all the cavities, and forms the margins of the openings;\r\nit presents no signs of irritability, and may be easily pressed out of\r\nthe porous mass with the hand, so slight is the connexion between the\r\nskeleton and the investing tissue. Currents of water constantly enter\r\nthe small pores, traverse the inosculating canals, and issue from the\r\nlarger orifices, which often project above the surface in perforated\r\npapillæ. By the circulation of the water through the porous structure,\r\nthe nutrition of the organized mass is effected; and the modifications\r\nobservable in the number, size, form, and disposition of the pores,\r\nchannels, and orifices, in different species, appear to be subservient\r\nto this especial purpose; the imbibition and expulsion of water being\r\nthe only function the sponges perform. In its earliest stage the sponge\r\ngemmule is of a spheroidal shape, and covered with vibratile cilia, and\r\nafter expulsion from the canals in which it is formed, moves rapidly\r\nthrough the water till it becomes attached to some body, and is then\r\nimmovably fixed during life; exhibiting no signs of vitality save the\r\naqueous circulation through the pores and canals.\r\n\r\n[194] The Mediterranean and American sponges of commerce are devoid\r\nof spicules, and are deprived of their soft animal matter simply by\r\nwashing freely in fresh water.\r\n\r\n[195] I particularly allude to a siliceous Sponge from Barbadoes, named,\r\nby Mr. Samuel Stutchbury, formerly of the Bristol Institution, (now of\r\nAustralia.) _Dictyochalix pumicea_. This specimen is of a fungiform\r\nshape, and appears to the naked eye as if formed of pumice stone, but\r\nunder the microscope is literally a tissue of transparent silex.\r\n\r\nThere is much confusion in the arrangement and nomenclature of the\r\nfossil species of this class of zoophytes; and this has originated, in\r\npart, from the varied forms assumed by the same species, having been\r\ndescribed under different names; and from the reprehensible practice of\r\nchanging, without sufficient reason, the name assigned to a species by\r\nthe original discoverer; an evil, unfortunately, not restricted to this\r\ndepartment of natural history.\r\n\r\nThe recent Sponges are arranged in four groups according to their\r\nstructure, viz.--\r\n\r\n _Fresh-water Sponges._\r\n\r\n Spongilla: siliceous spicula in a translucent jelly-like mass.\r\n\r\n _Marine Sponges._\r\n\r\n Tethea: having a tough outer skin; siliceous spicula in bundles, and\r\n radiating from the compact nucleus to the periphery.\r\n\r\n Halichondria: (from _silex_ and _cartilago_) siliceous spicula in a\r\n cartilaginous mass.\r\n\r\n Grantia: calcareous spicula in a gelatinous mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL SPONGES.]\r\n\r\nM. D'Orbigny seems to believe that with the exception of the\r\nhorny _Cliona_, all the fossil sponges had originally calcareous\r\nskeletons,--\"qu'ils n'ont jamais été cornés, mais que leur tissu a\r\ntoujours été calcaire et pierreuse;\"[196] which is certainly not the\r\ncase, for abundant examples of fossil keratose sponges occur.\r\n\r\n[196] Cours Elémentaire de Paléontologie, torn. ii. p. 208.\r\n\r\nI have selected a few genera for the illustration of the subject, and\r\nshall describe them under the names that are most familiar to the\r\nBritish scientific collector: doubtless sooner or later some competent\r\nnaturalist will undertake the elucidation of this department of\r\npalæontology, and construct a classification and nomenclature based\r\non natural characters; till then the student will find it hopeless to\r\nattempt to learn the ever-varying names of genera and species applied\r\nto fossil Porifera and Polypifera, by different observers.[197]\r\n\r\n[197] It has happened most unfortunately, that but recently Mr.\r\nLonsdale, in the late Mr. Dixon's beautiful work on Chalk and\r\nTertiary Fossils, and Mr. Milne Edwards in his able Monograph in the\r\nPalæontological Society's Memoirs, have described many of our chalk\r\nCorals under different specific and generic names.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPONGITES IN CHALK AND FLINT.]\r\n\r\nOn the Sponges in Chalk and Flint.--From the durability of the tissue\r\nof the flexible sponges, and the imperishable nature of those which\r\nhave a siliceous or calcareous endo-skeleton or framework, their fossil\r\nremains generally occur in a fine state of preservation, and in immense\r\nquantities, in the sediments that were deposited in those parts of the\r\nancient sea-bottoms, originally inhabited by these zoophytes. Even the\r\nrelics of the keratose species, the _Halichondria_, whose structure\r\nconsists of siliceous spines imbedded in a cartilaginous mass, are\r\nequally abundant. Sponge-spicula are everywhere met with in the chalk,\r\nflint, and greensand, and many layers in the cretaceous strata are\r\nalmost entirely composed of them.\r\n\r\nSponges so commonly form the nuclei of the nodular flints, that some\r\nnaturalists have ascribed the formation of the layers and nodules\r\nof silex in the cretaceous rocks to these zoophytes: a supposition\r\naltogether groundless,[198] The various states of mineralization in\r\nwhich sponges occur in the chalk give rise to many beautiful and highly\r\ninstructive fossils, as we shall point out in the course of this\r\nnotice. In general the zoophyte is simply invested by the flint, the\r\npores and tubes being filled with silex, the original tissue appearing\r\nas a brown reticulated calcareous mass. In other examples the sponge\r\nhas been permeated by the liquid flint, and subsequently perished; and\r\nin this manner have been formed those hollow nodules which on being\r\nbroken are found to contain only a powder, consisting of siliceous\r\nspicules and fragments of silicified sponge. But in numerous instances\r\nthe substance of the zoophyte is completely silicified, and the\r\nintimate structure of the original exquisitely preserved; such are many\r\nof the flint-pebbles, and moss-agates, that are mounted as brooches and\r\nother ornaments.\r\n\r\n[198] See Wonders of Geology, p. 300. This question is fully considered\r\nin a Memoir entitled Notes of a Microscopical Examination of the Chalk\r\nand Flint of the South-East of England, &c. by the Author, in 1845.\r\n\r\nSpongites.[199]--This name I would apply generically to those fossils\r\nwhich appear to be identical in structure with the ordinary marine\r\nsponges that consist of a fibro-reticulated porous mass, destitute of\r\nregular tubes or canals: the form exceedingly various.\r\n\r\n[199] _Achilleum_ of Schweigger.\r\n\r\nThe fossil sponges of the chalk may be divided into two groups; the\r\ncyathiforms, or cup-shaped, and the ramose, or branched. Flints\r\ninclosing the first kind, generally exhibit externally the form of\r\nthe original; those containing the branched species are of irregular\r\nshapes, and except by an experienced observer, the nature of the\r\nenclosed body would not be suspected. On breaking them, the sponge is\r\noften well displayed, as in the specimen figured in _Lign. 69, fig.\r\n2_: the surface of this fossil was covered with a white gritty powder,\r\nmade up of minute needle-shaped siliceous spicula.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPONGITES IN FLINTS.]\r\n\r\nSpongites Ramosus.--A branched sponge, sometimes from twelve to fifteen\r\ninches long, is not uncommon in the flints of the Lewes and Brighton\r\nchalk; the stems and branches are cylindrical, and the terminations\r\nof the latter are rounded and full of large pores. When completely\r\nsilicified the structure can only be detected by fracture, but\r\noccasionally the sponge appears to have been saturated with liquid\r\nchalk before it was enveloped in the flint; and as it is coated with\r\ncalcareous matter, it may be detached from the nodule entire.[200]\r\n\r\n[200] In this manner I obtained the beautiful specimen (now in the\r\nBritish Museum) figured in my Foss. South Downs, tab, xv. fig. 11. A\r\nbranch of this species is represented Pict. Atlas, pl. xxxix. fig. 12.\r\n\r\n_Spongites lobatus_ (sp. Fleming) is figured Pict.

(_Pict. Atlas_, pl. xli.)--The cyathiform flints,\r\nwhose shape depends on the inclosed zoophytes, so much resemble the\r\ncup-shaped sponges of commerce, as to be easily recognized in the\r\nheaps of nodules that are collected in chalk districts for the roads;\r\nthey are from one to eight inches in diameter at the upper part, and\r\nmany are of a globular or spheroidal shape; the surface has the usual\r\ncalcareo-siliceous coating of flint nodules, giving a sensation of\r\nroughness to the touch; the margin of the cup generally exhibits a\r\nnarrow band of porous structure, and when broken, sections of the\r\nenclosed body are exposed. These funnel-shaped spongites terminate at\r\nthe bottom in a peduncle, whence fibrous root-like processes diverge;\r\nby these appendages the original was fixed to the rock. I have\r\ncollected a few specimens in which the roots are attached to a shell,\r\nor pebble, but have never seen any that appeared to occupy the spot\r\non which they grew. They seem to have been detached from their native\r\nsites by the waves, and transported to a distance, and subsiding into\r\nthe tranquil depths of the ocean, became imbedded in the cretaceous\r\nsediments that were accumulating at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSpongites (?) labyrinthicus.[202] _Lign. 80, fig. 5._--Another\r\nabundant species of amorphozoa has given rise to sub-hemispherical\r\nflints, rounded below and flat above, with a marginal band of porous\r\ntissue, that expands into flexuous lobes which fill up the area of\r\nthe upper surface. When found imbedded in the chalk, the form of this\r\nzoophyte is often preserved entire; the upper part showing the lobated\r\nand flexuous character of the original. Upon breaking these flints,\r\nthe organic structure is generally apparent; but in many instances\r\nhas perished, and left a cavity which is either partially filled with\r\nstalactitical chalcedony, or lined with quartz crystals. These fossils\r\nvary in size from a walnut to that of an orange; the pedicle has long\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[202] Foss, S. D. tab. xv. _fig._ 7.\r\n\r\nA lobed zoophyte, resembling the above in its general form, and\r\nlong rootlets, is distinguished by a large central cavity, which is\r\ncontinued above the body in the form of a cylinder.[203]\r\n\r\n[203] Beautiful figures of these and other chalk zoophytes are given\r\nby Mr. Toulmin Smith in his elegant memoir \"On the Ventriculidæ.\"\r\nThe specimens above described are named _Bracholites_ by Mr. Smith.\r\nThe plan of the present work forbids the discussion of that author's\r\nopinions and inferences.\r\n\r\nSpongites (?) flexuosus. _Lign. 80, fig. 10._--Among the\r\ncyathiform flints that abound in the chalk, a very elegant species\r\nis distinguished by a flexuous band that runs round the margin, and\r\nindicates the lobed structure of the original.\r\n\r\nIn the chalk of Flamborough Head, Yorkshire, many beautiful cyathiform\r\nsponges are preserved, in which the outer surface is thickly covered\r\nwith projecting hollow papillæ; these fossils are generally silicified,\r\nthe surface and pores being frosted over with minute quartz crystals.\r\nThe museum of the York Institution contains a splendid series of these\r\nspongites.[204]\r\n\r\n[204] The silicified state of these zoophytes was first detected by Mr.\r\nCharlesworth, who by immersing specimens in dilate hydrochloric acid,\r\nobtained admirable examples of the delicate structure of the original.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ZOOPHYTES OF FARINGDON.]\r\n\r\nFossil Zoophytes of Faringdon. _Lign. 70, 71, 72._--The richest\r\nlocality for fossil sponges in England is in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the little town of Faringdon, in Berkshire.[205] The\r\nGreensand beds that overlie the Oolite in that district, consist of\r\na coarse friable aggregation of sand, comminuted shells, corals,\r\namorphozoa, and echinoderms, more or less consolidated by a ferruginous\r\ncement. The gravel-pits, as the quarries are locally termed, expose\r\nwhat evidently were banks of detritus thrown up on the strand of a\r\nsea-margin; among the water-worn and fragmentary relics of oolitic as\r\nwell as cretaceous forms, many perfect sponges of various kinds may be\r\ncollected in the course of a few hours.

The fossil\r\nrepresented by _fig. 5_, though named Tragos by collectors, appears\r\nto differ in the structure of the inner surface from the type of this\r\ngenus: it is a remarkably beautiful species.[207]\r\n\r\n[207] It may be convenient to distinguish it as _T. Faringdoniensis_.\r\n\r\nThe base in all these Greensand sponges is flat and expanded; not\r\nfibrous and root-like, as in the spongites of the chalk previously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAmong the shingle at Brighton, Margate, Dover, Isle of Wight, &c.\r\npebbles containing fossil sponges may frequently be discovered. When\r\nthe flint nodule has been broken, and the calcareous particles of\r\nthe inclosed zoophytes are washed away by the action of the waves,\r\na delicate silicified tissue remains.[208] Many of the large solid\r\npebbles, are portions of silicified sponges, and polished specimens are\r\nbeautiful objects under the microscope.\r\n\r\n[208] The pebbles represented in Pict.

The body of the zoophyte is a mass of dense porous tissue,\r\nof a pyriform or bulbous shape, supported by a slender stem fixed\r\nat the base by rootlets. The stem is composed of very fine parallel\r\nlongitudinal tubes, which extend to a series of canals that traverse\r\nthe mass, and terminate in openings on the surface of a shallow central\r\ncavity, as shown in the section, _fig. 2, Lign. 73_. The characters\r\nof this genus are well exemplified in a common species of the Greensand\r\n(_S. pyriformis_, _Lign. 73_), described by the late Mr. Webster, from\r\nspecimens collected in the Isle of Wight, where it occurs in profusion,\r\nnear Ventnor, and the Western lines. This zoophyte is pyriform,\r\n(_Lign. 73, fig. 1_,) and has a shallow cylindrical cavity, supported\r\nupon a long slender stem, the base of which is fixed by root-like\r\nprocesses (_fig. 5_); the transverse fracture shows a section of the\r\nlongitudinal tubes. This species has been found in numerous localities\r\nof the Greensand, and also in the Firestone or malm-rock.[209]\r\n\r\n[209] Dr. Fitton's figures, Geol.

In the\r\nFirestone of Southbourne, Steyning, and Bignor, in Sussex, I have\r\nobserved large pyriform and subcylindrical Siphoniæ.\r\n\r\nThe organization of all these zoophytes was evidently adapted for the\r\nimbibition and circulation of sea-water, in a more perfect and definite\r\nmanner than in the irregular simple sponges.\r\n\r\nFlint-pebbles inclosing remains of Siphoniæ abound on the Sussex\r\ncoast, especially in the shingle near Brighton, having been washed out\r\nof the chalk cliffs. There were several chalk-pits in Edward-street,\r\n(now, I believe, filled up and the area built upon,) in which every\r\nflint enveloped a sponge or siphonia; many specimens were mineralized\r\nby pyrites and beautifully exhibited the internal structure of the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nSiphonia Morrisiana. _Lign. 69, fig. 3._--A polished slice of a\r\npebble from Brighton, whose markings are derived from the transverse\r\nsection of an undescribed zoophyte is figured, _ante_, p. 224: though\r\nscarcely more than half the diameter of the original is preserved,\r\nyet its structure is well shown; the centre is occupied by numerous\r\nparallel openings, the sections of longitudinal tubes, and is\r\nsurrounded by a broad zone of spongeous tissue.\r\n\r\nI have seen many examples of this beautiful fossil, set for brooches in\r\nthe jewellers' shops in the Isle of Wight, and at Brighton.[211]\r\n\r\n[211] The specific name is in honour of John Morris, Esq. F.G.S. the\r\nauthor of the \"Catalogue of British Fossils,\" whose important services\r\nto Palæontology and Geology it is gratifying thus to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nThere are coloured figures of Siphonite in Pictorial Atlas, pl. xxxix.\r\n_fig._ 9; pl. xlii. _fig._ 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, and 13; pl. xliii. _fig._ 6.\r\n\r\nSiphoniæ (chiefly _S. pyriformis_) are abundant in the Upper Greensand,\r\nnear Farnham in Surrey, but their tissues are saturated with phosphate\r\nof lime, instead of silica as is ordinarily the case; the entire sponge\r\nusually contains between 50 and 60 per cent, of phosphate: hence these\r\nfossils have, of late, been in great request for manure.[212]\r\n\r\n[212] Mr. Payne, of Farnham, a distinguished agriculturist, has largely\r\nmade use of them, both in the natural state and treated with sulphuric\r\nacid. The Firestone strata on St. Catherine's Hill, Isle of Wight,\r\nhave been dug for a like purpose. See an \"Account of the Phosphate\r\nDiggings,\" in my Isle of Wight, Second Edition, p. 448.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHOANITES KÖNIGI.]\r\n\r\nChoanites Königi, _Lign. 75._--The zoophyte which has given rise to\r\nthe fossils I have distinguished by the name of Choanites,[213] is of\r\na spheroidal or sub-ovate form, and appears to have been composed of\r\na softer tissue than the ordinary sponges. It has a central cavity,\r\nand was fixed at the base by long rootlets: its mass is traversed by\r\nnumerous tubes or channels, which open on the inner surface of the\r\ncavity; it differs from Siphonia in not having a stem composed of\r\nbundles of tubes, and probably also in its constituent substance.\r\nAmong the Sussex and Wiltshire chalk-flints specimens of this zoophyte\r\nare very common; they are easily recognized by the peculiar markings\r\nproduced by the silicified tubes that radiate from the centre, as seen\r\nin _Lign. 75, fig. 4_. The semi-diaphanous pebbles on the Sussex\r\ncoast, more frequently contain Choanites than any other zoophytes. From\r\nthe beautiful and varied markings observable in the polished sections,\r\nthey are in great request for brooches, and are termed _petrified\r\nsea-animal flowers_[214] by the lapidaries; among the shingle on the\r\nsea-shore at Bognor, Worthing, and other places, very fine examples may\r\nbe collected.\r\n\r\n[213] Foss.

The opening at the\r\nbase of _fig. 4_, marks the spot whence the processes of attachment\r\nproceeded. The vertical section of a flint, similar to _fig. 4_, is\r\nshown at _fig. 3_; and in this example are seen the central cavity,\r\nand a section of the substance of the zoophyte, which is traversed\r\nby numerous tubes, that ramify through the mass of which the body\r\nwas composed, and terminate in openings on the inner wall of the\r\ncentral cavity, or sac. A transverse section of a similar flint is\r\ndelineated in _fig. 1_; the central white spot indicates the sac filled\r\nwith flint, and the tubes are seen radiating from it through the\r\nmass; under a powerful lens the interstitial structure appears to be\r\ngranular rather than porous. The perfect transparency of the body when\r\nsilicified, and the rich tints it has acquired from metallic solutions,\r\nand the compressed state in which it is often found, seem to indicate\r\nthat the original mass was a soft gelatinous substance, like that\r\nof the _Actinia_, strengthened by spicula; for numerous tri-radiate\r\nspines, like those on the left-hand of _fig. 5, Lign. 75_, occur\r\noccasionally in chalk specimens.\r\n\r\nIn many Choanites, which differ in no other respect from the present\r\nspecies, vertical sections show on each side the central cavity,\r\nlarge oval spots, that are sections of a canal which traverses the\r\nentire mass, proceeding from the base to the summit, in a spiral coil\r\naround the central cavity. This structure was first detected by Mr.\r\nCunnington. Mr. Woodward thinks this spiral tube is common to all the\r\nChoanites, and constitutes a generic character; but so many examples\r\nhave passed under my examination in which no traces of such a canal are\r\nperceptible, that it may be a specific difference.\r\n\r\nAmong the chalk amorphozoa whose true affinities are doubtful, is a\r\nsmall turbinated zoophyte, which I would place provisionally under this\r\ngenus; it has a shallow central cavity, with a broad smooth margin, a\r\nreticulated external surface, and radicle processes proceeding from the\r\nbase; see _Lign. 80, fig. 1_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PARAMOUDRA.]\r\n\r\nParamoudra. _Lign. 76._--This vernacular Irish term was introduced by\r\nDr. Buckland, in his account of some gigantic flints, thus popularly\r\nnamed, that occur in the chalk near Belfast, and also at Whitlingham,\r\nnear Norwich. These fossils are of an irregular, oblong, spherical,\r\nor pyriform shape, having a cavity above, which, in some specimens,\r\nextends to the bottom; indications of a pedicle are seen at the base;\r\nin short, they closely resemble, upon a large scale, the funnel-shaped\r\nspongites, so frequent in the flints of the South Downs. Their\r\nappearance _in situ_, is represented _Lign. 76_, from Dr. Buckland's\r\nillustrations: _b_, is a single specimen, partly imbedded in the chalk,\r\nand _c_, _d_, two of the fossils in contact, the pedicle of the upper\r\none lying in the cavity of the lower.\r\n\r\nThese bodies are from one to two or more feet in length, and from six\r\ninches to a foot in diameter. The appearance, both of the outer and\r\ninner surface, is that of the usual white calcareo-siliceous crust of\r\nspongitic chalk-flints. Upon breaking them, no decided structure is\r\nperceptible; but here and there, patches of red and blue chalcedony\r\noccur, as in the Ventriculites and spongites in chalk-flints; the\r\noriginals were probably large goblet-shaped zoophytes, allied to the\r\nsponges, but of so perishable a nature as to leave but few traces of\r\ntheir organization, save their general form. Specimens may however yet\r\nbe found with the structure preserved, for many years elapsed after the\r\nfirst discovery of flint ventriculites, before I obtained examples that\r\nthrew light on their origin and formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 76. \"Paramoudra;\" seen in a vertical section of a\r\nChalk-pit, near Moira.\r\n\r\n(_The Very Rev.

These fossils Mr. Morris has distinguished by the\r\nname _Clionites_, to indicate their origin; they are not, however, the\r\nsilicified sponge, but inorganic casts, moulded in the excavations.\r\nThe common species is _C. Conybearei_: \"cells irregular, somewhat\r\npolygonal, with one or more papillæ; surface finely tuberculated;\r\nconnecting threads numerous.\"[217]\r\n\r\n[216] For an account of the characters of the recent Cliona, see a\r\nmonograph by Mr. Hancock, Annals of Nat.

These spines\r\nare tubular, and of various shapes; some are acicular, or needle-like;\r\nothers of a stellate form; many are tri-radiate or multi-radiate; and\r\nsome have the shape of a trident; a few of these fossils are figured\r\nin _Lign. 75_. As the _Actinia_, _Gorgonia_, and _Alcyonia_, possess\r\nspicula, some of the fossil spines may have been derived from those\r\nzoophytes. The larger spicules may be discovered with a lens of\r\nmoderate power, or even by the unassisted eye; but all will amply repay\r\na microscopical examination, and the minutest can only thus be detected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPINIFERITES IN FLINTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 77.

Ehrenberg, were regarded as identical with the siliceous\r\nfrustules of the genus of fresh-water Desmidiæ, named _Xanthidium_[218]\r\n(_ante_, p. 91.) Later and more correct observations have proved that\r\nthe fossils under consideration entirely differ from their supposed\r\nhomologues; their original substance not being siliceous, but flexible\r\nand membranous; and that instead of being spores of algæ, they are\r\nprobably the gemmules either of porifera, or of polypifera.\r\n\r\n[218] Several recent species of Xanthidium are figured in _Plate IV._ of\r\nthis volume.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the perpetuation of the error by the retention of the\r\nbotanical name of a recent genus of plants, for fossils whose vegetable\r\norigin is very problematical, and which are entirely distinct from\r\ntheir supposed analogues, I would substitute that of Spiniferites,[219]\r\na term simply expressive of the general aspect of these bodies; that of\r\na globe or sphere beset with spines. The appearance of these fossils\r\nwill be understood by the examination of a group discovered by Mr.\r\nReginald Neville Mantell, in a fragment chipped off from a flint\r\npebble; and I will describe the mode by which these minute objects\r\nwere detected, as it offers a good practical lesson for the young\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\n[219] From _spina_, a spine, and _fero_, to bear.\r\n\r\nThe chip of flint is represented, of the natural size, in _Lign. 77,\r\nfig. 1_; it was immersed in oil of turpentine for a short time, and\r\nthen placed on a piece of glass, and examined with a moderate power, by\r\ntransmitted light, the turpentine having rendered the translucent flint\r\nalmost as transparent as glass; this appearance is shown in _fig. 2_;\r\nthe organisms here represented are from 1/300 to 1/500 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. The half-inch object-glass was next employed, and _fig. 3_\r\ngives the result. The quarter-inch object-glass, and a corresponding\r\neye-piece, were then substituted, and by the adaptation of a camera\r\nlucida, _figs._ 4, 5, and 6, were delineated. As _fig. 5_ proved to be\r\na new species, it was named after its discoverer.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in flint, when rendered transparent and viewed by\r\ntransmitted light under a high power, as shown in _Lign. 78_, and\r\n79, appear as hollow globular bodies, beset with spinous processes,\r\nwhich in most species are fimbriated at the extremities. There is\r\nconsiderable variety in the form and length of the spines. In _S.\r\nReginaldi_, these appendages are numerous, regular, short, and\r\nrelatively thick: in an elegant species discovered by the Rev. J. B.\r\nReade (_Lign. 79_) they are long and palmated: in other kinds they are\r\nof intermediate size and proportions.[220]\r\n\r\n[220] Excellent figures of several species are given in a Memoir by H.\r\nH. White, Esq. of Clapham, in the Trans. Microscopical Society, vol. i.\r\np. 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 78.\r\n\r\nSpiniferites Reginaldi.\r\n\r\n(_Magnified 500 diameters_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 79.\r\n\r\nSpiniferites palmatus; in flint.\r\n\r\n(× 500 _diameters_.)]\r\n\r\nThe apparently torn and collapsed state of the body and arms of some\r\nexamples first led me to doubt the siliceous nature of the original\r\nsubstance; and on my discovery of the soft parts of foraminifera in\r\nflint and chalk, Mr. Deane undertook to search for the so-called\r\nXanthidia in chalk, that these bodies might be subjected to chemical\r\nanalysis,[221] Mr. Deane succeeded in detecting all the usual species in\r\nthe Dover chalk, by digesting some chalk in dilute hydrochloric acid,\r\nand mounting the residue in Canada balsam. In this state the shape of\r\nthe body is that of a depressed sphere; many of the specimens appear to\r\nhave a circular opening, and the arms or spines to be closed at the\r\nextremities. Upon pressure under water between two pieces of glass,\r\nthey were torn asunder as a horny or cartilaginous substance would\r\nbe, and the spines in contact with the glass were bent. Some after\r\nmaceration in water several weeks became flaccid; a proof that they are\r\nnot siliceous.[222]\r\n\r\n[221] A torn and apparently shrunken specimen from chalk, is represented\r\nin my paper on Foraminifera; _Philos.

Microscopical\r\nJournal, 1846.\r\n\r\nThe real nature of these fossils must be regarded as still\r\nundetermined: their prevalence in the chalk-flints whose forms are\r\nderived from zoophytes, seems to countenance the supposition that the\r\nSpiniferites are the gemmules or early state of animals of this family;\r\nbut I have never detected any organic connexion between them and the\r\nporifera with which they are associated; it is possible they may be the\r\ngerms of the remarkable zoophytes we have next to examine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENTRICULITES.]\r\n\r\nVentriculites.[223] _Lign. 80, 81, 82._--At every step of our review\r\nof the fossil zoophytes, I find myself embarrassed by the conflicting\r\nopinions entertained by naturalists, respecting some of the most\r\nabundant of the extinct forms; arising from the imperfect state of\r\nour knowledge as to the structure of the originals, which compels\r\na comparison with recent types, from which, perhaps, the fossils\r\ndiffered essentially in their organization. This remark especially\r\napplies to the zoophytes which have given rise to the fungiform flints\r\nso well known to the inhabitants of the chalk districts of Sussex,\r\nas \"_petrified mushrooms_,\" from their close resemblance in form to\r\nfungi: a specimen with this name inscribed on it in the cabinet of a\r\nfriend first drew my attention to these curious fossils. In _Lign.\r\n80, figs. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9_, several flints of this kind are\r\nrepresented; _figs._ 3, 6, 8, are fungiform; _fig._ 7, is the upper\r\npart of a specimen, the stem having been broken off; _figs._ 2 and\r\n4, are examples of the lower part of the zoophyte; in all, there are\r\nopenings at the base, and a groove on the margin or edge of the upper\r\npart in which the structure of the inclosed fossil is visible; upon\r\nbreaking these flints, sections of a funnel-shaped body are exposed.\r\n\r\n[223] Ventriculite; from _ventriculus_, a ventricle or sac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 80.

In _fig._ 3, a fungiform\r\nflint, resembling _fig._ 6, of _Lign. 80_, is seen in the lower part\r\nof a cup-shaped zoophyte; while above, and surrounding the flint, the\r\nimpression remains of the reticulated outer surface, deeply coloured\r\nby a ferruginous tinge. In _fig._ 4, _Lign. 81_, a small turbinated\r\nflint, resembling _fig._ 4, of _Lign. 80_, occupies the base, and three\r\nrootlets are seen emerging from it at a. In _Lign. 82, fig. 1_, in\r\nwhich the chalk has been removed so as to expose the outer surface of\r\nthe Ventriculite, a flint occupies the centre at c; above which, the\r\nradiating reticulated structure is spread out on the chalk, _a_; the\r\nbase, with its roots, is shown at _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 81.

The disciform flints originated from the expanded\r\nexamples, _Lign._ 81, _figs._ 1 and 2: and when the silex\r\nwas insufficient to silicify the entire zoophyte, an annular\r\nflint, resembling a quoit, was formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 82.

The outer integument was reticulated, that\r\nis, disposed in meshes, like net-work; and the inner surface studded\r\nwith regular openings, apparently the orifices of tubular cells. The\r\nsubstance of the mass appears to have been sufficiently flexible to\r\nexpand and contract without laceration. This opinion is based on the\r\nfact, that in many specimens the zoophyte is a nearly flat circular\r\ndisc (_Lign. 81, figs. 1, 2_); and in others a subcylindrical pouch. In\r\nthe former state the outer reticulated structure is elongated, while\r\nin the latter, it is corrugated; hence I am led to conclude that the\r\noriginal possessed a common irritability, and was able to contract and\r\nexpand like many of the flexible polypiaria. The openings on the inner\r\nsurface are cylindrical, and very regular; the flints often present\r\nsharp casts of them, which appear like rows of minute pillars. When the\r\nflint filling up the cavity of a Ventriculite can be extracted, it is a\r\nsolid cone, studded with papillæ, the casts of the cells, as in _Lign.\r\n82, fig. 4_.\r\n\r\nIn the flints, the substance of the Ventriculites is generally as\r\ntranslucent as that of the Choanites, and defined by its rich purple,\r\nsienna, or grey colour;[224] but towards the base and margin it is\r\nmore or less calcareous; and in many examples the whole, or a large\r\nportion of the zoophyte, is in this state. But this fact does not\r\ninvalidate the inference that the original was flexible; for in these\r\ninstances the tissues may have been immersed in fluid chalk before\r\ntheir envelopment in flint,[225] The chalk specimens are commonly as\r\nfriable and earthy as the surrounding stone, from which they are\r\ndistinguishable by their ochreous colour.\r\n\r\n[224] Pict. Atlas, pl. xlv. _fig._ 9, represents a beautiful transverse\r\nsection of the lower part of a Ventriculite in flint, richly\r\ncoloured. Pl. xliii. _fig._ 16, is a pebble containing the base of\r\na Ventriculite; the orifices on the top have been produced by the\r\ntransit of the radicle processes; for the fossil is drawn in an\r\ninverted position, a common error before the origin of these flints was\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[225] A piece of sponge dipped in liquid plaster of Paris, and\r\nafterwards inclosed in a transparent substance, as glass, would present\r\nsuch an appearance.\r\n\r\nThe stain always observable in the tissues of the chalk Ventriculites\r\nand other zoophytes, while the surrounding white limestone is\r\nuncoloured, may be explained by the chemical changes to which the\r\ndecomposition of animal matter under such circumstances would give\r\nrise. If sulphuretted hydrogen were evolved from the putrifying\r\nzoophytes imbedded in calcareous mud containing iron in solution,\r\nthe sulphur would enter into combination with the iron, the hydrogen\r\nescape, and a sulphate or sulphuret of iron be deposited, atom by atom,\r\nand thus impart colour and permanence of form to the original.\r\n\r\nWhen the inclosed organisms in the flint nodules have perished,\r\nchalcedony, quartz crystals, or crystallized pyrites, sometimes of\r\ngreat beauty, are found occupying the cavities; in short, numerous\r\nmodifications of the petrifactive process are beautifully exhibited in\r\nthese common, but highly interesting, cretaceous fossils.\r\n\r\nThe species to which the previous remarks more immediately refer, is\r\nnamed _Ventriculites radiatus_; from the radiated appearance of the\r\nexternal integument; some of the expanded specimens are more than one\r\nfoot in diameter.[226]\r\n\r\n[226] The reader interested in the history of these objects should\r\nconsult Foss. South Downs, p. 167, plates x, xi, xii. xiii. xiv. A\r\nmemoir by the Author on these fossils, under the name of _Alcyonium\r\nchonoides_, with four beautiful plates, was published in the Linnæan\r\nTransactions, vol. xi. 1821.

This\r\nfossil is inversely conical, and somewhat resembles the cast of the\r\ncavity of _Ventriculites radiatus_, but a little attention will\r\nenable the collector to distinguish it. The flint that is moulded\r\nin _V. radiatus_, is surrounded by the substance of the zoophyte,\r\nand if found detached, with the investing material removed, shows no\r\nstructure whatever, but simply a surface covered with minute papillæ.\r\nThe present zoophyte is generally included in a nodule, and by a slight\r\nblow may be readily separated from the surrounding flint; it then has\r\nthe appearance of a white calcareous cone, beset with regular cells,\r\ndisposed in quincunx order (_Lign. 83, fig. 2_); leaving a conical\r\ncavity in the flint, which is covered with corresponding eminences\r\n(_Lign. 83, fig. 4_). Upon breaking the cone itself, it is found to\r\nconsist of a dense reticulated structure, from one-eighth to a quarter\r\nof an inch in thickness (_Lign. 83, fig. 2a_), investing a solid\r\nnucleus of flint, the surface of the latter being covered with minute\r\npoints, which are less regular than those on the cavity of the outer\r\ncase. The specific name, _inclusa_, was suggested by this character;\r\nwhich, however, is only accidental, for the specimens imbedded in\r\nchalk, are simply surrounded by the stone. It is the calcareous nature\r\nof the fossil, which renders it so easily separable from the investing\r\nflint, while its cells afford numerous points of attachment, and these\r\nremain as casts in relief on the interior of the hollow case: I have\r\nnot observed the same regularity of structure on the inner as on the\r\nouter surface.\r\n\r\n[227] Icones Foss. Sect. _fig._ 98.\r\n\r\nThe reticulated integument of this zoophyte resembles in structure\r\nthat of _V. radiatus_. With regard to the latter, I should state that\r\nMr. Toulmin Smith[228] discovered that the inosculating fibres of the\r\nintimate tissue formed an octahedral plexus at each knot or point\r\nof union; and this structure Mr. Smith regards as peculiar to the\r\nVentriculites, and states that he detected it in all the fossils he has\r\narranged under the name _Ventriculidæ_. No spicula have been detected\r\nin the integuments.\r\n\r\n[228] \"On the Ventriculidæ;\" a series of papers published in the Annals\r\nof Natural History, with many figures of cretaceous zoophytes. By\r\nToulmin Smith, Esq.\r\n\r\nUntil more ample and satisfactory evidence is collected as to the\r\nnature of these fossils, the interests of science will be best promoted\r\nby allowing the question to remain sub judice, and restricting the term\r\nVentriculites to those zoophytes which possess the general characters\r\nof the type to which the name was originally assigned; namely, a\r\nvasiform or subcylindrical framework, terminating at the base in a\r\npoint, and fixed by radicle processes; the substance consisting of\r\na plexiform fibrous tissue; externally constituting a reticulated\r\nintegument, the meshes disposed in a radiating manner from the base\r\nto the periphery; the inner surface studded with open cells regularly\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nIn the former edition of this work the Ventriculites were placed with\r\nthe Polypifera from the structure of the openings or cells, for these\r\nare so symmetrical, and disposed with so much regularity, as to present\r\na closer analogy to the polype-cells of a coral, than to the large\r\npores of a sponge. The doubts expressed by many eminent observers as to\r\nthe correctness of this view, have induced me to insert this notice in\r\nthe present section; leaving the true affinities of these organisms to\r\nbe determined by future observers. Possibly we have in these fossils\r\nthe relics of a tribe of zoophytes of an extinct type, that formed a\r\nconnecting link between the _porifera_ and the _polypifera_; however\r\nthis may be, I will venture to affirm that no one who had seen the\r\ninfinitely varied examples of these fossils that I have, would for a\r\nmoment confound them, as some naturalists have done, with the Scyphiæ,\r\nand other simple amorphozoa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 84.\r\n\r\nA Coral-polype in flint.\r\n\r\n× 500 _diameters_.\r\n\r\n(_Seen by transmitted light._)]\r\n\r\nPolype in Flint. _Lign. 84._--I will here notice an exceedingly minute\r\nand interesting object, discovered by the Rev. J. B. Reade, in a flint\r\ncontaining vestiges of a Ventriculite, and which may possibly belong\r\nto this tribe of zoophytes. It must however be remarked, that there\r\nwas nothing to show the collocation was not accidental. The drawing\r\nwith which Mr. Reade favoured me, is engraved _Lign. 84_. This object\r\nis unmistakeably a polype-cell, with some of the integument of the\r\nanimal protruding, in the form of a shrivelled tube. The possibility\r\nof soft animal tissues being preserved in flint, will not now admit\r\nof question, as we shall show when treating of the Foraminifera. The\r\nrecord of this fact may load to the discovery of other fossils of a\r\nlike nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Polypifera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POLYPIFERA.]\r\n\r\nAs we proceed in our investigations, the impossibility of rigidly\r\nadhering to a zoological classification based on the structure of\r\norgans, of which but few, if any, traces exist in the mineral kingdom,\r\nbecomes more and more apparent; the durable skeletons or polyparia\r\nbeing the only materials from which the palæontologist can gather\r\ninformation, relating to the physiology of the extinct coral-animals\r\nwhich swarmed in the ancient seas, and whose petrified remains\r\nconstitute a large proportion of the secondary and palæozoic calcareous\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nNumerous fossil genera have been established by various authors from\r\nthe external form of the polyparium, or the disposition and structure\r\nof the cells; but a slight attention to this department of palæontology\r\nwill disclose corals which differ essentially from the typical forms,\r\nand new genera and species will require to be added to the already\r\nextended catalogue. The few genera selected for the present work,\r\nwill convey a general idea of the nature of this class of fossils. To\r\nascertain the names of the species he may collect, the student must\r\nrefer to works especially devoted to the illustration of the corals of\r\nparticular rocks; as for example, those of the British _Cretaceous_\r\ndeposits in the monographs of the Palæontological Society; of the\r\n_Palæozoic_ in _Sil. Syst._; and in Prof Sedgwick's Synopsis of the\r\nClassification of the Brit. Pal. Foss.; of the _Mountain Limestone_\r\nin Prof, Phillips's work; and those of Ireland in Col. Portlock's\r\nGeological Memoirs. Those of the palæozoic rocks of New York, are\r\nillustrated in Prof. James Hall's splendid work on the Geology of that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe fossil zoophytes included in this section present innumerable\r\nvarieties of form and structure, but agree in the important character\r\nof having originated, (with but few exceptions,) from aggregations\r\nof those minute beings termed Polypes (many-feet[229]). The common\r\nHydra (_Wond._ p. 600), or fresh-water polype, that inhabits pools\r\nand streams, is a familiar example of a free animal of this kind,\r\nconsisting of a cellular gelatinous substance, in the form of a short\r\ntube, or pouch, surrounded at the upper margin by long tentacula,\r\nor feelers, which appear to the naked eye as delicate threads. The\r\n_Polypifera_, properly so called, are groups of polypes, permanently\r\nunited by a common integument or axis, each animalcule having an\r\nindependent existence. A common support or endo-skeleton, termed\r\n_polyparium_,[230] is secreted by the integuments, which varies in\r\nits nature from a mere gelatinous, or horny material, to an earthy,\r\ncalcareous, and even siliceous substance, that remains when the polypes\r\ndie, and their soft parts have perished. All the varieties of corals,\r\n&c. are nothing more than the durable structures of aggregated masses\r\nof such beings.\r\n\r\n[229] A name derived from the tentacula, or processes, which in some\r\nspecies serve for prehension, and in others for respiration.\r\n\r\n[230] The basis, framework, or endo-skeleton, of these groups\r\nof animalcules is termed the _polyparium_, or _polypidom_\r\n(polype-habitation); those of a stony hardness are familiarly known as\r\ncorals; these names, therefore, refer to the durable substance, and not\r\nto the animals themselves; but in familiar writing, the term Coral is\r\noften used to designate the entire living mass. The Red-Coral forms a\r\ndistinct genus called _Corallium_. In fossils, the _polyparium_ alone\r\nremains, except in very rare instances.\r\n\r\nIt may here be necessary to notice a prevailing error, regarding the\r\nmode in which the substance called coral is produced. It is very\r\ngenerally supposed that Corals, particularly those bearing stars and\r\ncells, have been constructed by animalcules, in the same manner as\r\nis the honey-comb, by the Bee; and the expressions often employed\r\nby naturalists, of \"the coral animalcules building up their rocky\r\nhabitations,\" and \"constructing their cells,\" have contributed to\r\nfoster this error. But the processes are in no respect similar: the\r\ninsect, under the guidance of an unerring instinct, resulting from\r\nits peculiar organization, _constructs_ its cells; but the polype is\r\nincapable of forming, or even modifying, its support or cell in the\r\nslightest degree. The polypidom is _secreted_ by the animal tissues, in\r\nthe same manner as are the bones in the vertebrated animals, without\r\nthe individual being conscious of the process. If a piece of white\r\ncoral be immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid, the calcareous part is\r\ndissolved, and the secreting membrane, in the form of a flocculent\r\nsubstance, is seen attached to the undissolved part; even in some\r\ncoralline marbles of incalculable antiquity, the animal membrane may,\r\nin this manner, be detected.[231]\r\n\r\n[231] See Pict. Atlas, pl. xxxiv. _fig._ 2.\r\n\r\nFrom the delicate and perishable nature of many of the gelatinous\r\nzoophytes, numerous tribes may have inhabited the seas, which deposited\r\nthe fossiliferous strata, and yet no indications of their existence\r\nremain; while, of others, but obscure traces of their structure are\r\nlikely to be detected.\r\n\r\nThe Polypifera are separated into two natural groups or classes; viz.\r\nthe Anthozoa (flower-animals), and the Bryozoa (moss-animals), or\r\nPolyzoa.\r\n\r\nThe Anthozoa are polypes of the most simple type of structure. The body\r\nconsists of a symmetrical gelatinous sac, capable of contraction and\r\nexpansion, with one aperture or mouth, which is encircled by tentacula.\r\nThe Hydra, or fresh-water polype (_Wond._ p. 600), is a familiar\r\nexample of a single, locomotive, anthozoan animal. In the compound\r\nor aggregated forms, the body is either inclosed in a horny sheath\r\n(ex. _Sertularia_, _Wond._ p. 615), or is supported by a lamellated\r\ncalcareous endo-skeleton (ex. _Fungia_, _Wond._ p. 623, pl. vi. _fig._\r\n15), or the soft parts invest a stony axis (ex. _Madrepora_, _Wond._ p.\r\n620), or a horny flexible framework (ex. _Gorgonia_, _Wond._ p. 616).\r\n\r\nThe Anthozoa are subdivided into three orders, which are based on\r\nthe peculiar characters of the polypes; the _Hydra_, the _Actinia_\r\n(Sea-Anemone, _Wond._ p. 622), and the _Alcyonium_ (Dead-men's fingers,\r\n_Wond._ pl. v. _fig._ 10), being respectively the type of 1. the\r\n_Hydroida_, or Hydraform; 2. the _Asteroida_ or Alcyonian; and 3. the\r\n_Helianthoida_, or Actiniform zoophytes.\r\n\r\nIn the Hydroida the body in the compound species is implanted in a\r\nhorny tubular sheath, and the polypidoms form branched corallines,\r\nwhich are fixed by the base to rocks, sea-weeds, shells, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Asteroida have a horny or calcareous axis, surrounded and inclosed\r\nby the soft parts which secrete it.\r\n\r\nThe Helianthoids, except in the simple free species, as the Actinia,\r\nhave a lamellated calcareous polypidom, the plates of which radiate\r\nfrom a centre.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous secretions of the Anthozoa, especially of the\r\nHelianthoida, in a great measure constitute the mass of the coral-reefs\r\nand coral-islands of tropical seas. Their polypidoms, whether external\r\nor internal, maintain but little organic connexion with the compound\r\nsoft substance. These zoophytes increase by gemmation or budding; some\r\nthrow up germs from the disk, as in Astreadæ; others laterally, as in\r\nCaryophillidæ; and some spirally along the stem, as in Madreporidæ;\r\nexamples of these modes of reproduction are often found in fossil\r\ncorals. The increase of coral-rocks is produced by the continual\r\nformation of new masses, by the successive generations which spring up\r\nas it were from the bodies of their parents; layer upon layer, and tier\r\nupon tier, of Helianthoid polypidoms, are found to compose many of the\r\ncoralline limestones of the palæozoic formations.\r\n\r\nFossil Anthozoa.--The first group of extinct corals to be noticed under\r\nthis head is the _Graptolitidæ_, a family restricted to the Silurian\r\nrocks, and whose natural affinities have been much questioned; some\r\npalæontologists referring them to the _Pennatulidæ_, or Sea-pens,\r\nothers to the _Sertulariadæ_.[232]\r\n\r\n[232] For a full consideration of this subject, refer to Prof. McCoy's\r\nBrit.

Prof. McCoy refers them to the order Hydroida.\r\n\r\nIn a recent state these bodies were probably covered with a soft, or\r\nalbuminous mass, studded with polype-cells, disposed in rows along\r\nthe margins of the lateral, curved, grapple-like processes, as in the\r\nzoophytes termed _Virgularia_,[234] to which one kind bears a great\r\nanalogy. If two specimens of the _Graptolites Ludensis_ be placed\r\ntogether, so that the elongated smooth edges be in apposition, the\r\nunited stems will be seen to offer a general resemblance to the axis of\r\n_Virgularia mirabilis_.\r\n\r\n[234] See British Zoophytes, pl. xxiv.\r\n\r\nM. Barrande divides the Graptolites into three groups or genera, which\r\nare defined as follow:--\r\n\r\n_Graptolites_ (proper), a single series of cells united together at the\r\nbase, and adhering along the sides nearly to the orifice of each cell,\r\nas in _fig. 1a_. _Monoprion_ of M. Barrande.\r\n\r\n_Rastrites._--The axis reduced to a mere line, on which the cells are\r\nplaced at relatively wide intervals, and but slightly inclined. These\r\ntwo genera are supposed to have been hydroid zoophytes, and related to\r\nthe Sertularidæ.\r\n\r\n_Diprion_ (_Diplograpsus_ of Mr. McCoy), cells in two series arranged\r\nalong a central axis; these forms present a foliaceous appearance; they\r\nare presumed to resemble the existing genera Pennatula and Virgularia.\r\n\r\nGraptolites have been found in strata of the same age in Norway,\r\nSweden, and Scotland.[235] I have received slates literally covered with\r\nthem, from the Silurian rocks of the United States, by the kindness of\r\nmy friend, Benjamin Silliman, jun.

Murchison remarks, that the nature of the strata in which these\r\nremains occur in Radnorshire, indicates a condition of the sea, well\r\nsuited to the habits of the family of Pennatulidæ, or Sea-pens; for\r\nthe recent species live in mud and slimy sediment, and the fossils are\r\nimbedded in a finely levigated _mud-stone_, which, from its structure,\r\nmust have been tranquilly deposited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will next describe the single lamellated Anthozoa, and afterwards\r\nnotice those corals which consist of an aggregation of radiated cells,\r\neither frondescent, or disposed in solid masses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FUNGIA. ANTHOPHYLLUM.]\r\n\r\nFungia (_Wond._ p. 623).--The corals thus named, from their supposed\r\nresemblance to fungi, are of a depressed form, and have the under\r\nsurface scabrous; they are divided above by numerous lamellæ, or\r\nplates, which radiate from a central, oblong depression.\r\n\r\nWhen living, the solid stony polyparium is enclosed in the gelatinous\r\nmass by which it was secreted, and there are numerous tentacula\r\naround the central cavity, or sac. These zoophytes may be compared\r\nto the _Actiniæ_, or Sea-Anemones, from which they differ only in\r\nhaving a calcareous axis, while the Actiniæ have a tough albuminous\r\nintegument.

XXXV.\r\n\r\n[240] Org. Rem. vol. ii. pl. iii. figs. 4, 5, 6.\r\n\r\nSyringopora ramulosa. _Lign. 88, fig. 2._ (_Wond._ p. 641.) These\r\ncorals bear a general resemblance to the Organ-pipe Coral of Australia.\r\nThe polypidom is composed of long, cylindrical, vertical tubes, distant\r\nfrom each other, and connected by transverse tubular processes; the\r\ncells are deep and radiated by numerous lamellæ.\r\n\r\nThe external aspect of these fossils is that of a cluster of\r\ncylindrical pipes, more or less parallel, connected by short transverse\r\nbranches. They are the _Tubiporites_ of Mr. Parkinson, who has given\r\nadmirable figures of several specimens.[241] In these fossil corals\r\nthat excellent observer first detected the animal membrane. A slab of\r\nmarble, whose markings are produced by the section of the inclosed\r\ntubes of a Syringopora, is represented, _Wond._ p. 644, _fig._ 2. The\r\nMountain limestones of Derbyshire, and of Clifton, on the banks of the\r\nAvon, contain figured marbles of this kind, which are manufactured into\r\nvases, tables, &c.

The simple\r\nturbinated forms are often several inches long, and being somewhat\r\ncurved, have obtained the popular name of \"_petrified rams-horns_.\"\r\n\r\nUpon slitting one of these corals vertically, as in _Lign. 87, fig.\r\n1_, the axis of the polyparium, beneath the cell, is found to consist\r\nof thin transverse partitions, constituting a series of chambers.\r\n\r\nIn the compound Cyathophylla, the germs of young cells, occupying\r\nthe disc of a parent cell, are often met with. _Fig._ 3 represents a\r\ngroup of four germs on the parent cell, of _C. dianthus_, a common and\r\nbeautiful coral of the Dudley limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 87, Corals from the Dudley Limestone.\r\n\r\n(_Sil.

The Astreæ, Caryophylliæ, Cyathophylla, &c., form the\r\nprincipal mass of the coralline limestones of the Oolite, termed the\r\n_Coral-rag_, from the abundance of these relics: being literally\r\ncomposed of an aggregation of large corals, the interstices of which\r\nare filled with shells, radiaria, &c., either whole, or in a comminuted\r\nstate. The heaps of this limestone placed by the road-side, in the\r\nN. W. of Berkshire, appear like fragments of an old coral-reef, and\r\nattract the notice even of the most incurious observer. I have figured\r\na specimen of Astrea, _Lign. 88, fig. 1_, and a polished section,\r\n_fig. 1a_, from Clifton, a locality well known for the stupendous\r\nmural precipices of mountain limestone rocks, which yield beautiful\r\nexamples of coralline marble.[245] The mode of increase of the Astrea\r\nis very curious; a subdivision takes place in the old cells, after the\r\nmanner of the Infusoria; and among the fossils, a star or cell may\r\noften be seen in progress of division into two, three, or four stars\r\n(_Sil.

Tisburiensis._ _Wond._ p. 641, _fig._ 9), is\r\nfound in large hemispherical masses, completely silicified, at Tisbury,\r\nin Wiltshire. The transverse surface displays, in some specimens,\r\nbeautiful white radiated stars, on a dark blue ground; and in others,\r\nthe colours of the stars and ground are reversed. This silicified\r\ncoral is obtained from a bed of chert, a foot in thickness, which is\r\ninterstratified with the Portland limestone, this division of the\r\nOolite being quarried around Tisbury.[246]\r\n\r\n[246] See Catalogue of the Organic Remains of Wiltshire, p. iv. by Miss\r\nEtheldred Benett. 4to. 1831.\r\n\r\nIn the tertiary clays at Bracklesham Bay, Sussex, a beautiful small\r\ncoral of this type (_Siderastrea Websteri_, Dixon's Foss. tab. i, 5),\r\nis found attached to flint pebbles.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of this and the following genus, perfectly silicified,\r\nare found in the state of pebbles and boulders in the superficial soil\r\nof Antigua, and other islands of the West Indies, associated with the\r\nfossil palms, described in a former part of this work. Some of these\r\ncorals are of great beauty, and polished sections exhibit the coralline\r\nstructure most perfectly.[247]\r\n\r\n[247] In the \"Spongitenkalk,\" at Nattheim, near Heidenheim, all the\r\ncorals are replaced by chalcedony.\r\n\r\nMadrepora.--Polyparium arborescent or frondescent, porous, fixed;\r\ncells deep, with twelve rays, prominent, irregularly dispersed on the\r\nsurface, and accumulated towards the terminations of the coral.\r\n\r\nThe term madreporite, or fossil madrepore, was formerly applied to all\r\nthe branched fossil corals with radiated cells, but is now restricted\r\nto those which possess the above characters. The recent common species,\r\nfigured _Wond._ p. 620, will serve to illustrate this genus. The\r\nelevated, branched Madrepores, with minute polygonal cells having\r\ntwelve rays, the lamellæ of which are denticulated, are termed Porites,\r\nand are frequent in the Silurian strata (_Sil. Syst._).\r\n\r\nMillepora. _Lign. 89._--Coral ramose; cells very minute, distinct,\r\nperpendicular to the surface, giving the interior a finely striated\r\nfracture, disposed irregularly.\r\n\r\nThere are many fossil species of this genus, some of which are of\r\nconsiderable size. A small species from the mountain limestone is\r\nfigured _Lign. 89, fig. 7_.[248]\r\n\r\n[248] Millepora, Pict. Atlas, pl. xl. _fig._ 6.\r\n\r\nLithodendron. _Lign. 70, fig. 3._--Polyparium branched, formed of\r\ndeep, cylindrical, elongated cells, which are terminal, and radiated,\r\nwith a prominent central axis.\r\n\r\nLarge masses of corals of this genus, composed of clusters of\r\nbranches, are imbedded in the mountain limestone of Derbyshire,\r\nYorkshire, &c.; and a few species occur in the Coralline Oolite; their\r\ngeneral configuration will be understood by the figure _Lign. 70,\r\nfig. 3_; but in this specimen the margins of the cells are worn off,\r\nand do not present the original deeply excavated form.[249]\r\n\r\n[249] Lithodendron fasciculatum, Pict. Atlas, pl. xxxviii.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable specimen of this coral in the Bristol Institution\r\n(of which a portion is now placed in the Museum of Practical Geology,\r\nin London), that was discovered by Mr. Samuel Stutchbury,[250] in a\r\nvein of hematitic iron ore. It is a large mass, in which the entire\r\nsubstance of the coral is transmuted into a metallic ore, forming one\r\nof the most interesting natural electrotypes I have ever seen. In\r\nthis instance, a block of Lithodendron must have lain in a vein or\r\nfissure of the rock, and its animal membrane have resisted the action\r\nof the gaseous emanations, or mineral solutions, while the calcareous\r\npolypidom was dissolved, and the metallic matter deposited atom by\r\natom, as in the case of pseudo-morphous crystals.\r\n\r\n[250] Now of Sydney, Australia.\r\n\r\nGorgonia.--Of the flexible anthozoan coral, which from the flabellated\r\nform of the polyparium is generally called \"Venus's fan,\" and by\r\nnaturalists _Gorgonia_, a few fossil species have been discovered and\r\ndetermined. From the friable arenaceous limestone beds of Maestricht,\r\nwhich abound in corals, fine specimens of a delicate species are\r\noccasionally procured. _Wond._ p. 320, _fig._ 5, shows the character of\r\nthis fossil zoophyte.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Bryozoa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BRYOZOA.]\r\n\r\nThe second class of Polypifera, the Bryozoa or _Polyzoa_, are of a\r\nmuch higher order of organization than those which have engaged our\r\nattention. The body is not symmetrical, nor capable of contraction and\r\nexpansion, as in the Anthozoa: it consists of a digestive cavity or\r\nsac, which is bent on itself and open at both extremities. The outer\r\nintegument is either membranaceous or horny; sometimes calcareous. The\r\noral aperture or mouth is surrounded by a circle of tentacula, from\r\neight to twelve or more in number, and these tentacles are clothed with\r\nvibratile cilia. (_Wond._ p. 606, the polype of _Flustra pilosa_.)\r\n\r\nThe polypes in this order never occur singly; they are always united\r\nby a common integument, but each enjoys an individual existence. The\r\nanimal can extend its tentacula and protrude the mouth from the cell,\r\nbut the rest of the body is incapable of extension or contraction.\r\nThese polypifera increase by germination. In their organization,\r\nthey so closely approach the mollusca, that in recent zoological\r\nsystems they are placed in that class. The ciliated character of\r\ntheir tentacula has also led to their being named _Cilio-branchiata_.\r\nBut as it is desirable in a work of this elementary nature to avoid\r\nconflicting opinions as much as possible, the fossil Bryozoa will be\r\nconsidered as corals, in the general sense of that term.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FLUSTRA. ESCHARA.]\r\n\r\nFlustra (_Sea-mat_). _Lign. 89, fig. 4, 5._--The polyparium is\r\neither membranaceous and flexible, calcareous and encrusting, or\r\nfoliaceous, composed of cells, arranged in juxtaposition, more or less\r\nquadrangular, flat, with a distinct border, disposed on a flat surface,\r\nor on opposite surfaces, as in the _F. foliacea_.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common genera of the encrusting and frondescent\r\nzoophytes. The _Flustra_ consists of a cluster, or aggregation of\r\npolypes, invisible to the naked eye; under the microscope, the polype\r\nis found to be a transparent gelatinous body bent on itself, with a sac\r\nor digestive cavity, having two apertures, the external margin of which\r\nterminates in eight or ten tentacula, clothed with cilia; the whole is\r\nsurrounded by a firm wall, constituting a cell, from which the animal\r\ncan protrude its tentacula and upper part. (Figures of the living\r\npolypes of Flustræ, _Wond._ p. 605, _pl._ vi. _fig._ 6, 7.)\r\n\r\nMany species of _Flustræ_ occur in the British strata: the encrusting\r\nforms are attached to echinites, shells, &c.; the foliaceous are\r\nimbedded in chalk, sand, sandstone, &c. In Mr. Morris's _Cat. Brit.\r\nFoss._ ten species are enumerated; none of these are from formations\r\nbelow the Chalk. I have selected for illustration a Flustra attached\r\nto an echinite from Lewes. _Lign. 89, fig. 5_, represents a small\r\nportion of the natural size; and _fig. 4_, a few cells magnified, to\r\nshow their form and arrangement. A foliaceous zoophyte, apparently a\r\nbryozoon, is abundant in the Sussex and Kentish chalk, and is often\r\ndisposed in angular folds. It is generally of a ferruginous colour,\r\nand, from its friable texture, it is probable the original consisted\r\nof a membranous polypidom or calcareous substance; specimens sometimes\r\nextend over several square inches of the chalk. It is common in the\r\nchalk-pit at Off ham, near Lewes.[251]\r\n\r\n[251] In my South Down Fossils, pl. xv. _fig._ 6, a specimen of this\r\nkind is described as a Ventriculite, _V. quadrangularis_. An admirable\r\nlignograph of a remarkable example is given by Mr. Toulmin Smith, under\r\nthe name of _Brachiolites angularis_; it presents ten deep, flat,\r\nangular folds, and has radicle and lateral processes; see \"On the\r\nVentriculidæ,\" p. 93.\r\n\r\nEschara.[252]--In these zoophytes the polyparium is encrusting or\r\nfoliaceous, calcareous and brittle; the cells are thickened on their\r\nouter margins, and have a small, depressed, round aperture. They are\r\narranged in two series of planes, adhering together, the cells on each\r\nsurface exactly corresponding.\r\n\r\n[252] So named from a supposed resemblance to an eschar.\r\n\r\nSpecies of Escharæ are found either in flints, or attached to\r\nechinites, and other bodies; they have the appearance of patches of\r\nflustræ, but with a lens may be distinguished by the symmetrical\r\njuxtaposition of the cells on the opposite sides of the polyparium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ellen Maria Mantell, ad nat. delt._\r\n\r\nLign. 89.

I notice this genus to direct attention to\r\na very curious polypidom from the Greensand of Maidstone, presented to\r\nme by Mr. Bensted. The specimen is attached to a fragment of shell. The\r\ncells, five of which are represented, _fig._ 10, are elliptical, with\r\nthe aperture above, and towards one extremity; they are united by very\r\nslender, hollow filaments: _fig. 3_, two of the cells seen from above\r\n× 250 linear; _fig. 10b_ the same seen in profile.[253] I have named\r\nthis species _C. Johnstoniana_, as a tribute of respect to the author\r\nof the admirable works on British Zoophytes, previously noticed.\r\n\r\n[253] I refer this fossil to the genus _Crisia_ with some hesitation;\r\nperhaps _Hippathoea_ would be more correct, but all the described\r\nspecies of the latter are branched.\r\n\r\nThe fragmentary relics of numerous minute and elegant corals,\r\nconstitute a considerable portion of the mass of some of the white\r\nchalk strata; several genera of these zoophytes are figured in Mr.\r\nDixon's beautiful work, and described by Mr. Lonsdale. Attached to\r\nthe surface of shells, &c., and sometimes standing erect in little\r\ncrannies, or hollows, of the flints, many beautiful corals may often be\r\ndetected with the aid of a lens. By brushing chalk in cold water, and\r\nexamining the deposit, the student will probably discover several of\r\nthe species figured in _Lign. 89_, which we proceed to describe.\r\n\r\nRetepora (_Lace-Coral_). _Lign. 89, fig. 13._--A very thin calcareous\r\npolyparium, disposed like net-work in foliaceous and branching plates;\r\ncells opening either on the upper or inner side.\r\n\r\nThese are an elegant tribe of corals, of which many species occur in\r\nthe Chalk formation at Maestricht, in the white-chalk of England,\r\nin the mountain limestone of Yorkshire, (_Phil. York._), and in\r\nthe Silurian deposits (_Sil. Syst._). It may be useful to state,\r\nthat in the description of the fossil retepores, the openings in\r\nthe net-work are called fenestrules--the spaces between the ends,\r\n_dissepiments_--and those between the fenestrules, interstices. A\r\ndelicate fossil retepore from the mountain limestone of Yorkshire (_R.\r\nflexa_), is figured _Lign. 89, fig. 13_.\r\n\r\nFenestrella.--Cells very small, indistinct externally, with small\r\nprominent openings; polyparium stony, fixed at the base, composed of\r\nbranches, which inosculate by growth, and form a cup. Numerous delicate\r\ncorals, formerly arranged as _Reteporæ_, occur in the Silurian rocks,\r\nand have been placed in this genus by Mr. Lonsdale. (_Sil. Syst._ p.\r\n677.)\r\n\r\nPetalæpora pulchella.[254] _Lign. 69, fig. 1._--This beautiful\r\ncretaceous coral is \"tubular, free except at the base; framework\r\ncomposed of vertical laminæ, with an intermediate foraminated\r\nstructure; apertures to the tubular cavities distributed over the\r\nsurface; exterior varying with age.\" It has slender round dichotomous\r\nbranches, and the polyparium when entire must have formed an elegant\r\nplexus of coral. A layer an inch thick, full of branches of this\r\nzoophyte, is exposed on the face of the chalk cliffs, near Dover; and\r\nbeautiful masses, several inches square, made up of this coral, Idmonea\r\nand Pustulopora, may be obtained. The microscopic specimen figured in\r\n_Lign. 69_, was obtained with many other corals by washing chalk with a\r\nbrush, and examining the detritus deposited.\r\n\r\n[254] Mr. Lonsdale. Dixon's Fossils, p. 285.\r\n\r\nPustulopora. _Lign. 89, fig. 8._--Another very common tubular\r\nbranched coral of the Dover chalk; the tubes are cylindrical, their\r\napertures are arranged in annular or spiral rows, and slightly\r\nprojecting, giving a pustulous appearance to the stem and branches.\r\nSpecimens covering a piece of chalk six or eight inches wide, and a\r\nfoot long, have been discovered. The example figured is a very minute\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nHomœsolen ramulosus.[255] _Lign. 89, figs. 9, 11._--This delicate\r\nbranched coral is formed of large and small tubes variously\r\nintermingled, both inclined in the same direction, partially visible\r\non the surface, or wholly concealed, limited to one side of the coral;\r\nmouths simple tubular extremities; back without pores, composed of a\r\ncontinuous lamina.[256]\r\n\r\n[255] Homœsolen, from ομοιος, similar; and σωλην, a tube.\r\n\r\n[256] Mr. Lonsdale, in Dixon's Fossils, p. 307, tab. xviii. B. figs, 3,\r\n4, 5.\r\n\r\nThe elegant coral, _fig. 11, Lign. 89_, is thus named by Mr.\r\nLonsdale; it resembles his _fig. 4_. The fossil, _fig. 9, Lign.\r\n89_, though very different in its branching, and in the surface, which\r\nis covered with pores, is evidently identical with _fig. 3_ of Mr.\r\nLonsdale, which he refers to the same species.\r\n\r\nIdmonea, _Lign. 89, fig. 6._--In this elegant coral the polyparium is\r\ncalcareous, branched, porous; the cells distinct, prominent, arranged\r\nin single rows, more or less inclined, on each side a median line on\r\nthe inner face only. The genus is extinct.\r\n\r\nA beautiful species of Idmonea, of which a small branch is figured in\r\n_Lign. 89_, abounds in the chalk of Kent and Sussex; it often forms a\r\ncluster, two or three inches in circumference. The surface of the stems\r\nis covered with minute pores, and the cells are distinct, and placed in\r\nsingle rows; the left-hand figure of _fig. 6_ shows the plain surface,\r\nand that on the right, the opposite and inner, each margin of which\r\nis garnished with a row of cells; a portion magnified is represented\r\n_fig. 12_.[257]\r\n\r\n[257] In the former edition of this work, I named this species _I.\r\nDixoniana_, to commemorate the researches of my late friend, Frederic\r\nDixon, Esq., of Worthing, who had formed an interesting collection\r\nof chalk fossils, and announced a work on the \"Zoology of the Chalk\r\nFormation,\" to be richly illustrated with figures of many undescribed\r\norganic remains. It appears that a species, supposed to be identical,\r\nhad been previously named by Mr. Milne Edwards, _I. cretacea_. See\r\nDixon's Foss. tab. xviii. A. _fig._ 5, p. 281. Mr. Lonsdale places it\r\nin a new genus, with the name of Desmeopora semicylindrica. It will\r\nconvey some idea to the unscientific reader, of the labour bestowed\r\non this department of palæontology, to learn that the description and\r\nidentification of but 25 species of minute corals, represented on three\r\nplates, occupy ninety pages of close printing in royal 4to. of Mr.\r\nDixon's work.\r\n\r\nIdmonea Comptoniana,[258] _Lign. 89, fig. 14._--This is a very small\r\nand remarkable coral; it is dichotomous, cylindrical, with elongated\r\ndistinct cells, which are disposed in triplets, at regular distinct\r\nintervals, on one side of the stem.\r\n\r\n[258] This specific name is in honour of the noble and highly respected\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, the Marquess of Northampton. 1844.\r\n\r\nWe have now described all the fossil corals figured in _Lign. 89_; and\r\nhave shown what interesting organisms may be detected in a few grains\r\nof calcareous earth. It would be easy to give restored figures of the\r\nbeings whose stony skeletons are the subject of these remarks, from\r\ntheir close resemblance to existing species; every pore and cell might\r\nbe represented fraught with life; here the agile inmates, with their\r\nlittle arms fully expanded, and in rapid motion; there retreating\r\nwithin their recesses, and devouring the infinitesimal living atoms\r\nthat constitute their food; or rapidly shrinking up their tentacula\r\nupon the approach of danger; even their varied colours might be\r\nintroduced, and thus the beautiful and highly interesting picture drawn\r\nby the imagination, of a group of living zoophytes of the ancient chalk\r\nocean, be presented to the eye.\r\n\r\nAlthough, for convenience, I have selected the above examples\r\nprincipally from the cretaceous strata, the reader must not suppose\r\nthat other deposits are not equally prolific in these remains. The\r\nCoral-rag of the Oolite, many beds of the Mountain limestone, and\r\nthose of Dudley and Wenlock of the Silurian System, contain myriads\r\nof minute polypidoms associated with the coralline masses of which we\r\nhave already treated. Exquisite figures of the Silurian corals, by Mr.\r\nScharf, are given in _Sil. Syst._ pl. xv. xvi. and described by Mr.\r\nLonsdale. A slab of the Dudley limestone often has the entire surface\r\nstudded with minute corals of many species and genera, lying in bold\r\nrelief, and in an admirable state of preservation.\r\n\r\nVerticillipora (_Lign. 70, fig. 4. Lign. 72, fig. 3_).--Cells\r\nporiform, arranged in meshes on the surface of convex imbricating\r\nplates round a hollow axis, forming a fixed, irregular, subcylindrical\r\npolyparium. _Lign. 70, fig. 4_, represents a coral often met with\r\nin the gravel-pits at Faringdon, (_ante_, p. 228,) which is referred\r\nby Mr, Morris to this genus. It is composed of short cylindrical\r\nanastomosing tubular branches, emanating from an expanded base, divided\r\ninternally by transverse parallel plates, covered with exceedingly\r\nminute pores or cells, disposed in meshes; the plates surround a hollow\r\naxis; the structure is well shown in the figure.\r\n\r\nLunulites. _Lign. 70._--The polyparium is stony, orbicular, convex\r\nabove, concave below; concavity radiated; convexity covered with cells,\r\narranged in concentric circles on diverging striæ.\r\n\r\nA species of this coral is often found in the chalk: _Lign. 70, fig.\r\n1_, represents a specimen from the South Downs, discovered by Mr. Walter\r\nMantell. The natural affinities of this genus are not determined with\r\nprecision; but I have placed it with the Bryozoa in accordance with the\r\nopinion of M. de Blainville. It is an elegant white coral, and easily\r\nrecognized among the minute organisms of the chalk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISTRIBUTION OF FOSSIL BRYOZOA.]\r\n\r\nGeological Distribution of Fossil Zoophytes.--Although the geological\r\ndistribution of fossil zoophytes affords less striking phenomena than\r\nthat of the vegetable kingdom, yet some interesting reflections are\r\nsuggested by the facts we have thus cursorily noticed. We find that\r\nin the most ancient seas of which any vestiges of their inhabitants\r\nremain, these forms of vitality existed, and produced the same physical\r\nresults as at the present time; giving rise to coral-reefs, and banks\r\nof coral-limestones, and largely contributing to the solid materials\r\nof the crust of the globe. Nearly 400 British species are enumerated\r\nby Mr. Morris, and the list has subsequently been greatly extended by\r\nthe labours of Phillips, Portlock, Lonsdale, McCoy, Milne Edwards, and\r\nother eminent naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary formations afford numerous species of Caryophylliæ,\r\nFlustræ, Escharæ, Spongia, &c.; and the _Crag_, several genera that\r\nare as yet but imperfectly determined. The older Tertiary, or Eocene\r\ndeposits, contain Turbinoliæ, Astreæ, Fungiæ, Meandrinæ, and species\r\nof other genera, the recent types of which are inhabitants of tropical\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nThe zoophytes of the British Chalk have been illustrated in detail\r\nby Mr. Lonsdale in Dixon's Cretaceous and Tertiary Fossils of the\r\nSouth-East of England; and by Dr. Milne Edwards in the Monographs of\r\nthe Palæontological Society.\r\n\r\nIn the Maestricht deposits, lamelliferous corals, as Astreæ, Fungiæ,\r\nMeandrinæ, &c. prevail, and may be extracted from the friable\r\narenaceous limestones in a fine state of preservation. In the White\r\nChalk and Greensand of this country, the Spongites and allied genera\r\nare abundant, and associated with Caryophylliæ, Astreæ, and many forms\r\nof Bryozoa.\r\n\r\nBut in the cretaceous formation of England, no coral-reefs are\r\nobservable; the zoophytal remains, with but a few local exceptions,\r\noccur promiscuously intermingled with the fishes, shells, Radiaria, and\r\nother marine exuviæ; although many layers, or thin seams of chalk and\r\nmarl, are largely composed of the detritus of corals, like the modern\r\ndeposits of the Bermudas (_Wond._ p. 613). These phenomena are in\r\naccordance with the lithological characters of the White Chalk strata,\r\nand the nature of its mollusca, both of which indicate a deep sea; and\r\ncoral-reefs are only formed at moderate depths. But in regions where\r\nthe sea was shallow, during the deposition of the cretaceous rocks,\r\nbeds of coral limestone were produced; and these also contain littoral\r\n(sea-shore) shells, associated with the usual sponges and zoophytes\r\n(_Wond._ p. 613).\r\n\r\nIn the marine secondary formations antecedent to the cretaceous,\r\nnamely, the Lias and Oolite, coral-reefs, which appear to have\r\nundergone no change save that of elevation from the bottom of the sea,\r\nand the consolidation of their materials by mineral infiltrations,\r\ndemonstrate a condition of the ocean in our latitudes, which is now\r\nonly met with in the tropics (_Wond._ p. 614).\r\n\r\nThe limestones of the Carboniferous, Devonian, and Silurian formations,\r\nabound in anthozoan corals, and among them are many kinds of\r\nCyathophyllum, Lithododendra, Syringopora, Catenipora, Graptolites,\r\n&c., which are characteristic of these deposits.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian zoophytes are figured in _Sil. Syst._; and the splendid\r\nworks on the British Palæozoic Fossils, by Prof. Sedgwick and Prof.\r\nMcCoy, now in course of publication, contain many admirable figures of\r\nnew, or but imperfectly known species.\r\n\r\nThe extensive beds of coralline limestones, which are found in the\r\nSilurian strata, wherever they occur,--for the limestones of this\r\nsystem in North America are characterized by the same species of corals\r\nas those of England,--seem to indicate that a more equal temperature\r\nprevailed throughout the ocean, at that geological epoch, than at the\r\npresent time, when the geographical distribution of the coral zoophytes\r\nis strictly limited by temperature. The reef-forming genera are now\r\nconfined to waters where the temperature is not below 70°; their most\r\nprolific development being 76°. The apparent exception, the occurrence\r\nof coral-reefs at the Bermudas, is found to depend upon proximity to\r\nthe Gulf Stream (_Wond._ p. 614), which brings down the thermal waters\r\nof the tropics, and increases the local temperature of the sea in\r\nthose localities.[259]\r\n\r\n[259] Mr. Deane's splendid and masterly work on Corals, should be\r\nstudied by those who wish to be acquainted with the present state of\r\nthis branch of natural history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL CORALS.]\r\n\r\nOn Collecting Fossil Corals.--Few instructions are required for the\r\ncollection of fossil zoophytes; for as the most important characters of\r\nthe several kinds have been pointed out in the previous descriptions,\r\nthe student will be able to select illustrative specimens for his\r\ncabinet. The minute corals, &c. of the Chalk, and other limestones, are\r\nto be obtained by the same process as that directed for the discovery\r\nand preservation of the foraminifera, and other microscopic organisms,\r\nat the end of the next chapter. The larger examples should be left\r\nattached to a piece of chalk, when practicable, and the surrounding\r\nstone removed with a knife or graver, so as to expose as much of the\r\nfossil as may be required for the display of its characters, without\r\nloosening its attachment to the block. When the investing chalk is\r\nvery hard, frequently pencilling the specimen with vinegar, or dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid, will soften the stone, and render its removal easy,\r\nby means of a soft brush: when acid is employed, the specimen must\r\nafterwards be well rinsed in cold water.[260]\r\n\r\n[260] It may be well to caution the collector against employing\r\nsulphuric acid (commonly called _oil_ of _vitriol_) for this purpose,\r\nfor a white insoluble deposit (sulphate of lime) will thus be formed\r\non the specimen, and its appearance irremediably injured. Many of the\r\nfossil corals obtained from the chalk of Dover Cliffs, are so saturated\r\nwith muriate of soda, from long exposure to the spray of the sea, as\r\nto be liable to decomposition in the course of a few weeks, and are\r\ntherefore not worth purchasing of the dealers.\r\n\r\nThe zoophytes that are in part flint, and part chalk, as the\r\nVentriculites, (_ante_, p. 244, _Lign. 81_,) can rarely be obtained,\r\nexcept through the quarrymen who have been instructed how to extract\r\nthem from the rock. The first specimen of this kind that came under\r\nmy notice, I discovered while breaking a mass of chalk, in search\r\nof fungiform flints; when, to my great delight, I found the fossil,\r\n_Lign. 81, fig. 3_, by which at once, and for the first time, was\r\nshown the connexion between the chalk specimens, _Lign. 8, figs. 1,\r\n2_, and the flints figured in _Lign. 8, figs. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8_. Upon\r\nshowing this fossil to the quarrymen, and exciting their attention by\r\nsuitable rewards, I obtained the illustrative series now in the British\r\nMuseum.[261] Much light would be thrown on the nature of other zoophytes\r\nof the chalk that are invested with flint, if due care were taken in\r\nthe collection of specimens, and they were examined before extracted\r\nfrom the rock. Loose, delicate specimens, whether from the chalk or\r\ntertiary strata, should be affixed with strong gum-water to cards, or\r\npieces of thin board, covered with coloured paper.\r\n\r\n[261] Petrifactions, Room VI. p. 466.\r\n\r\nThe Greensand Spongites, Siphoniæ, &c. may often be extracted from the\r\nrock tolerably perfect, by a well-directed blow of the hammer; but\r\nfragile species should be left attached to a block, and the surrounding\r\nstone be carefully chiselled away, so as to expose the most essential\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe Faringdon zoophytes are, for the most part, encrusted by an\r\naggregation of minute polyparia, shells, and detritus, which may be\r\npartially removed by washing with a stiff brush, and their cavities\r\ncleared with a stout penknife, removing the extraneous matter by\r\n_chipping_, not by scraping, or the surface will be injured. In this\r\nmanner the beautiful specimens figured, _ante_, p. 228, were developed.\r\n\r\nThe Corals in the hard limestones can seldom be chiselled out to\r\nadvantage; for the most part, polished sections best exhibit the form\r\nand structure of the originals.\r\n\r\nWeather-worn or water-worn masses of coral limestone often display\r\nthe structure of the zoophytes of which they are in a great measure\r\ncomposed, in a beautiful state of sculpture and relief: the silicified\r\nor calcified corals appearing as perfect as if fresh from the sea.\r\nThe mural rocks of coral limestone at Florence Court, the seat of the\r\nEarl of Enniskillen, are in many parts encrusted, as it were, with\r\nsyringopora and other tubular corals, laid bare uninjured by the long\r\nand insensible effect of atmospheric erosion. A beautiful illustration\r\nof the old aphorism,--\"Aqua cavat lapidem non vi sed sæpe cadendo,\"--is\r\nafforded by the splendid examples of cateniporæ, fungiæ, caryophillæ,\r\nsculptured in alto-relievo on the face of the Silurian rocks over which\r\ndash the rapids at the Falls of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe silicified zoophytes of the West Indies, and those from Ava and the\r\nSub-Himalayas, form beautiful subjects for the microscope; and chips,\r\nor sections, should be prepared in the manner recommended for fossil\r\nwood in the same state of mineralization.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL ZOOPHYTES.]\r\n\r\nBritish localities.--The gravels and sands of the Crag afford most\r\nfavourable sites for obtaining tertiary zoophytes.\r\n\r\nIn the London clay at Bracklesham Bay, a species of Astrea (_A.\r\nWebsteri_) is often met with attached to flints and pebbles.\r\n\r\nIn the Greensand of Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight, an elegant coral\r\n(_Astrea elegans_) is by no means rare.\r\n\r\nThe Greensand gravel-pits, near Faringdon, in Berkshire, abound, as\r\nalready mentioned, (_ante_, p. 228,) in many kinds of sponges, and\r\nother porifera; and the quarries of oolitic limestone in the vicinity\r\nof that town, yield the usual corals of the Jurassic formation in great\r\nprofusion, I know of no locality richer in fossil zoophytes, than\r\nFaringdon.[262]\r\n\r\n[262] See Excursion, Part IV. of this work.\r\n\r\nThe quarries of that division of the Oolite called Coral-rag (as in the\r\nnorth-west of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, &c.), afford the\r\nusual corals of the Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe Oolite near Bath contains many species, and large masses of a\r\nminute coral (_Eunomia radiata_), are abundant.\r\n\r\nAt Steeple Ashton, in Wiltshire, numerous oolitic corals may be\r\nobtained. The silicified _Astreæ_, of Tisbury, in the same county,\r\ndeserve particular notice (_ante_, p. 263).\r\n\r\nClifton, near Bristol, and Torquay and Babbicombe, on the Devonshire\r\ncoast, are celebrated for their coralline marbles and pebbles; and many\r\nof the Derbyshire limestones are equally prolific in similar remains.\r\nThe Devonian marbles are so largely employed for ornamental purposes,--\r\nas brooches, tables, and side-boards,--that the figures produced by the\r\nsections of the enclosed corals must be familiar to the reader.[263]\r\n\r\n[263] Specimens of these fossil corals, either as objects of natural\r\nhistory, or as ornaments, may be obtained of Mr. Tennant, 149, Strand.\r\n\r\nDudley, Wenlock, and Ludlow, are well known for the abundance and\r\nvariety of Silurian polyparia.\r\n\r\nOther localities of British corals have been mentioned in the course of\r\nthis review of fossil zoophytes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL STELLERIDÆ; COMPRISING THE CRINOIDEA OR LILY-LIKE ANIMALS; AND\r\nTHE ASTERIADÆ, OR STAR-FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Radiata, or radiated animals, so designated because the parts of\r\nwhich the body is composed are arranged around a common centre or\r\naxis, are divided into three sub-classes; namely, 1, the _Polypifera_,\r\nwhose fossil remains were treated of in the previous chapter; 2. the\r\n_Acalepha_, or Jelly-fishes, whose structures are so perishable as\r\nto render it improbable that any vestiges of them will be found in a\r\nfossil state, though imprints of the general outline of certain kinds\r\nmay possibly occur;[264] and, 3, the _Echinodermata_, comprehending\r\nunder that term the _Stelleridæ_, or Crinoids and Star-fishes, and the\r\n_Echinoderms_, properly so called. This sub-class is the subject of the\r\npresent section; it comprises four orders, viz.\r\n\r\n               Crinoidea, or Lily-like Animals.\r\n\r\n               Asteriadæ, or Star-fishes.\r\n\r\n               Echinidæ, or Sea-urchins.\r\n\r\n               Holothuriadæ, or Sea-slugs.\r\n\r\n[264] The impression of an Acaleph resembling an _Æquorea_ (a kind of\r\nMedusa), is stated by M. Pictet to have been observed in a slab of\r\nschistose rock, in Germany.\r\n\r\nVestiges of the Stellerida are among the earliest relics of animal\r\norganization hitherto discovered. Many kinds of Crinoidea abound in\r\nthe Silurian rocks, and one genus of Star-fishes occurs in the same\r\ndeposits: the Echinidæ first appear in the Devonian formation.\r\n\r\nThe Echinodermata possess the radiated type of structure in an\r\neminent degree; especially the Asterioidæ and the Echinidæ, of which\r\nthe common Star-fish, and Sea-urchin, are familiar examples. The\r\nexternal integument or skin is in many kinds protected by spines,\r\n(hence the name Echinoderms or spiny-skin,) and perforated by numerous\r\nforamina for the imbibition and transmission of sea-water, and for the\r\nprotection of minute soft tubular processes (called _pseudopodia_),\r\nwhich constitute organs of adhesion and locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe first two orders have endo-skeletons, composed of numerous ossicula\r\nor little calcareous bones: in the third order, the Echinidæ, the body\r\nis inclosed in a calcareous case or shell, formed of numerous plates\r\nclosely adjusted to each other; in the fourth order, the Sea-slugs, the\r\nbody has only a tough outer integument without movable spines.\r\n\r\nDiversified in form and external appearance as are the Invertebrata\r\nthus grouped together, they are naturally related by their\r\norganization. The Crinoidea may be regarded as Star-fishes fixed to one\r\nspot by a jointed stem; the Star-fishes as free Crinoidea; the Echinidæ\r\nas Star-fishes with the rays coalesced and united into a globular or\r\nspherical case; and the Holothuriæ, as elongated Sea-urchins, destitute\r\nof spines, and without a calcareous envelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRINOIDEA.]\r\n\r\nCrinoidea.--The animals of this order are subdivided into families and\r\ngenera according to the number, form, and arrangement of the plates\r\ncomposing the calcareous case or receptacle, and the structure of the\r\narms and column. In one living family, the _Comatulidæ_, the body is\r\nfree; and in one fossil genus, the _Marsupite_, the animal is capable\r\nof locomotion through the water.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the _Crinoidea_,[265]--so named because the\r\nreceptacle and anus of some kinds resemble when in repose a closed lily\r\nor tulip,--are well exemplified in the recent _Pentacrinus_; the only\r\nknown living form that is identical in structure with the numerous\r\nextinct tribes, that swarmed in the seas of the palæozoic and secondary\r\nages.\r\n\r\n[265] From κρινον, _crinon_, lily, and ειδος, _eidos_, a form.\r\n\r\nThe Pentacrinus (_F. caput-medusæ_, _Wond._ p. 647), is an inhabitant\r\nof the Caribbean Sea, and but rarely obtained; there are specimens in\r\nthe British Museum[266] and in the Hunterian Collection of the College\r\nof Surgeons.\r\n\r\n[266] Petrifactions, p. 77.\r\n\r\nThis animal has a long stem or column, which is composed of pentagonal\r\ncalcareous plates or ossicula, articulated to each other by radiated\r\nsurfaces, and is fixed by the base to a rock, or other firm body. The\r\ncolumn supports a vasiform receptacle or cup, formed of calcareous\r\nplates in close apposition; in which the digestive and other viscera\r\nare situated. The upper part of the receptacle is covered by an\r\nintegument in which there is an aperture for the mouth. From the margin\r\nor brim proceed ten multi-radiate arms, which subdivide into branches\r\nof extreme tenuity. On the upper and inner side of the arms are\r\nnumerous articulated feelers or pinnæ. The ova are situated externally\r\non and near the base of the arms, as in the Comatulidæ; a family of\r\nliving Star-fishes, or more properly Crinoids, which have a receptacle,\r\nsurrounded by articulated and multi-radiate arms, but are free animals,\r\nbeing destitute of a column.\r\n\r\nIn the living state of Pentacrinus, the skeleton--for such are the\r\nspecimens in our museums--was of course covered and concealed by the\r\nsoft integuments and tissues by which it was secreted. The ossicula\r\ncomposing the stem are pentangular, and very numerous; they have a\r\ncentral perforation, and their articulating surfaces are ornamented\r\nby pentapetalous striations. There are numerous side-arms sent off\r\nfrom the column in groups of five, at uncertain distances. The mouth is\r\nsituated in the centre of a plated integument spread over the top of\r\nthe receptacle. The arms, which arise from the margin of the latter,\r\nsurround the mouth, and when spread out, with their numerous pinnæ\r\nor feelers expanded, form a net for the capture of prey; and are the\r\norgans by which the animal obtains food, and conveys it to the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CRINOIDEA.]\r\n\r\nFossil Crinoidea.--The fossil crinoids, like the recent prototype above\r\ndescribed, consist of an articulated column, and a receptacle formed of\r\ncalcareous plates, and articulated arms or tentacula. They constitute\r\ntwo groups; the _Encrinites_, in which the ossicula of the column\r\nare subcylindrical and smooth; and the _Pentacrinites_, with a stem\r\ncomposed of pentangular ossicles, as in the living Pentacrinus.\r\n\r\nThe petrified remains consist of the ossicula of the column, arms,\r\nand tentacula; of the plates of the receptacle; and of the peduncle,\r\nor process of attachment by which the animal was fixed to the rock.\r\nThe peduncle is in some species flat and expanded, like that of the\r\n_Gorgonia_; in others, it consists of long jointed processes. These\r\nseveral parts are commonly found detached, and intermingled with\r\ndetritus in the strata; throughout extensive beds of encrinital marble,\r\nvestiges of the receptacle are but seldom discoverable. In some\r\nlocalities the skeletons are preserved entire, and lie expanded on the\r\nsurface of the layers of shale, clay, or limestone, as if the animals\r\nhad been enveloped by the soft deposit when alive in their native seas.\r\n\r\nThese remarks will serve to convey a general idea of the nature of the\r\ncrinoidal remains which are scattered through certain rocks in such\r\ninconceivable quantities; for, much as the columns may differ in form,\r\nthe ossicula in their markings, and the plates of the receptacle in\r\ntheir configuration and ornament, the same general type of structure\r\nprevails throughout the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 90.

In the north of England these fossils\r\nare called _Fairy-stones_, and the circular perforated ossicula _Saint\r\nCuthbert's beads_; the latter were worn as ornaments by the ancient\r\nBritons, and are occasionally found in tumuli.\r\n\r\nThese petrifactions present considerable variety in form, and in the\r\nmarkings on their articulating surfaces, which are often radiated and\r\nsculptured in floriform and stellular figures (_Lign. 90, fig. 7,\r\n9_, and _Lign. 91, fig. 3, 4_). The central perforation is small in\r\nsome species, and large and pentagonal in others. The ossicula of the\r\nEncrinites often vary in size in the same column, being circular and\r\nelliptical, and thick or thin, alternately, as in the upper part of\r\nthe column of the Lily Encrinite, _Lign. 91, fig. 6_; by which great\r\nflexibility and freedom of motion were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe pentagonal stems also display many modifications; some have five,\r\nothers but four sides (_Lign._ 90, _fig._ 6, 8, 10, and 91, _fig._ 7,\r\n9); in some the angles are acute, in others rounded.\r\n\r\nPulley-stones. _Lign. 90, fig. 1._--The circular, or pentagonal\r\nchannel formed by the united ossicula of the column, has given rise to\r\nthe curious fossils called in Derbyshire the Screw, or Pulley-stones,\r\nwhich are flint casts of those cavities that occur in the beds of\r\nchert, interstratified with the mountain limestone. The siliceous\r\nmatter, when fluid, must have filled up the channel and invested the\r\nstem: the original calcareous ossicles have since been dissolved,\r\nand the casts, now solid cylinders of flint, resembling a pulley,\r\nremain. The masses of chert are often impressed with the ornamented\r\narticulating surfaces of the trochites.\r\n\r\nIn the quarries on Middleton Moor, near Cromford, Derbyshire, where\r\nextensive beds of limestone composed of crinoideal remains are worked\r\nfor chimney-pieces and other ornamental purposes, beautiful examples\r\nof these fossils may be obtained.[267] The cavities of the column and\r\nossicles are often filled with white calcareous spar, while the ground\r\nof the marble is of a dark reddish brown colour; in other varieties of\r\nthe Derbyshire encrinital limestones, the substance of the fossils is\r\nwhite, and the ground dark grey or brown,[268] A slab of this marble,\r\nwith portions of columns lying in relief, and a polished section\r\nshowing the inclosed entrochites, are figured _Wond._ p. 650.[269]\r\n\r\n[267] See Excursions around Matlock, Part IV. of this work.\r\n\r\n[268] Pict.

The genera, or sub-genera, are based on the\r\nmodifications of shape and structure of the receptacle; and their names\r\nare composed of the termination _crinus_, or _crinites_ (signifying\r\nstone-lily), with a term prefixed expressive of the generic character:\r\nthus we have _Apiocrinus_, or _Apiocrinites_, Pear Encrinite.[270]\r\n\r\n[270] The termination _crinus_ is now generally employed, instead of\r\n_crinites_; the latter is preferable, as it indicates the fossil nature\r\nof the specimens. A more expressive name than _Encrinite_ was suggested\r\nby Mr. Martin, of Derbyshire; that of _Stylastritæ_ or Column-Stars.\r\n\r\nThe receptacle being round and inflated, and composed of pieces\r\narticulated with the stems, and supporting the arms by similar\r\narticulations, are the generic characters of _Apiocrinites_ of\r\nMiller. When round but not inflated--_Encrinus_, when pentagonal,\r\n_Pentacrinus_. When the receptacle is composed of angular plates united\r\nat the edges and forming several series or stages, it constitutes the\r\nbasis of the following genera: viz,--\r\n\r\n_Platycrinus_; two series, the one of three, the other of five plates.\r\n\r\n_Pateriocrinus_; three series each of five plates.\r\n\r\n_Cyathocrinus_; three series of five plates, the last with five\r\nintercalated pieces.\r\n\r\n_Actinocrinus_; several series of plates: the first composed of three,\r\nthe second of five, and the others of many pieces.\r\n\r\n_Rhodocrinus_; several series of plates that are covered externally\r\nwith radiated ridges. The first course consists of three, the second\r\nof five, the third of ten, and the others of many plates.\r\n\r\n_Eugeniacrinus_; of five pieces united into one receptacle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brief explanation will enable the student to comprehend the\r\nnature of the almost infinite variety of figure and ornament which the\r\nfossil crinoidea present, and the principles of nomenclature generally\r\nadopted by modern authors. To attempt an enumeration even of the genera\r\nwould be inadmissible in these volumes. The late Mr. Miller's \"Natural\r\nHistory of the Crinoidea or Lily-shaped Animals,\"[271] will afford the\r\nstudent satisfactory information on this class of organic remains.[272]\r\n\r\n[271] Published in 1 vol. 4to. 1821, with coloured plates.\r\n\r\n[272] A beautiful \"Monograph on the Recent and Fossil Crinoidea,\" by\r\nMessrs.

Parkinsoni_). _Lign. 92, fig. 4._ (_Wond._. p.\r\n652.)--The Apiocrinite or Pear-Encrinite of Bradford, from its size, and\r\nthe abundance of its remains in one particular locality, is the most\r\ngenerally known of all the British fossil Crinoids. It abounds in the\r\nbeds of oolite, in the quarries on the heights above the picturesquely\r\nsituated town of Bradford, in Wiltshire. The receptacle, detached\r\nossicula, and the pedicle, are very common; and in some instances the\r\nentire endo-skeleton, from the peduncle to the extremities of the arms,\r\nis preserved. The late Channing Pearce, Esq., of Bradford, by unremitting\r\nattention to the collection of these fossils, obtained the beautiful\r\nspecimens deposited in the British Museum.[273]\r\n\r\n[273] Petrifactions, Room II. Wall-case G.\r\n\r\nThis Apiocrinite has a smooth receptacle of a pyriform shape, composed\r\nof large thin plates with radiated articulating surfaces; the stem\r\nis short and strong; the arms are simple, resembling those of the\r\n_Marsupite_; the peduncle spreads out into an expanded base, which\r\nis firmly attached to the rock, like that of the Gorgonia, and is\r\ngenerally of a rich purple colour.[274]\r\n\r\n[274] Pictorial Atlas, pl. xlix.

In\r\nBurfield quarry, on the heights that overlook the town, a bed of\r\nlimestone was exposed, the upper surface of which was incrusted with\r\nthe stony peduncles or roots of Apiocrinites; upon this stratum was\r\na layer of clay, in which were innumerable remains of receptacles\r\nand ossicula of stems and arms; some of the stems were erect, others\r\nprostrate, and throughout the clay were the dismembered remains. This\r\nsubmarine forest of Crinoideans must therefore have flourished in\r\nthe clear sea-water, till invaded by a current loaded with mud that\r\noverwhelmed the living zoophytes, and entombed them in the argillaceous\r\ndeposit in which their fossil remains are imbedded.[275]\r\n\r\n[275] Burfield quarry, on the heights of Bradford, is the locality\r\nreferred to; but I believe it is rarely that any specimens of the\r\nApiocrinite are to be found in an erect position. I could not learn\r\nfrom any of the local collectors, that an example had been seen by\r\nthem. When I visited the quarry in June, 1848, no good section of the\r\nbeds was apparent: a few detached plates of Apiocrinites were the only\r\nrelics we could meet with. Mr. Reginald Mantell, when engaged on the\r\nconstruction of the railway near Bradford, sought repeatedly, but in\r\nvain, to discover any Apiocrinites in an erect position, or as if lying\r\non the spot where they grew.\r\n\r\nThe constituent substance of the ossicula and plates of the Bradford\r\nEncrinite is calcareous, and has an oblique fracture; the colour is\r\ngenerally a light ochre, or a bluish grey.[276]\r\n\r\n[276] Pict. Atlas, pl. 1. contains figures of the Bradford Encrinites.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APIOCRINITE OF THE CHALK.]\r\n\r\nApiocrinus ellipticus. _Lign. 93._--Detached ossicula of this small\r\nencrinite are abundant in the White Chalk; the receptacle is known\r\nto the quarrymen by the name of \"_bottle_.\" The pieces composing the\r\ncolumn are cylindrical in the upper part, and elliptical and angular\r\nin the lower, and are articulated by a transversely-grooved surface.\r\nThe two upper joints are enlarged, and support the receptacle, which is\r\nsmooth and round (_fig._ 1). The column has articulated side-arms, and\r\nthe base numerous jointed processes of attachment, which, when found\r\napart from the column, have been mistaken for a distinct type, and\r\nnamed \"_Stag's-horn Encriniter_.\"[277] The specimens figured _Lign.\r\n93_, show the essential characters of this crinoid; when perfect, this\r\nspecies must have borne a general resemblance to the Pear Encrinite of\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\n[277] Pict.

A common\r\nform is that figured in _Lign. 91_, which is part of the receptacle\r\nof a crinoid, named as above; it differs from the other Apiocrinites\r\nof the chalk in the articulating surfaces of the ossicles not being\r\nradiated, and in the receptacle, which is small and pyriform, not\r\nhaving a distinct cavity; there is only a median canal, which is seen\r\nin a vertical section: but the entire structure of the summit does not\r\nappear to be shown in any specimens hitherto observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEncrinus liliiformis (_Lily Encrinite_). _Lign. 91, fig. 6._--This\r\nexquisite Crinoid is equally interesting and attractive to the amateur\r\ncollector and the naturalist. Its remains do not occur in the British\r\nstrata, and are only known in the muschelkalk of Lower Saxony. The\r\nspecimens in this country are chiefly from Erkerode, in Brunswick;\r\nthey are found in a layer, about eighteen inches thick, of a soft\r\nargillaceous cream-coloured limestone, chiefly made up of trochites,\r\ndetached ossicula, and a few fragile shells and corals.\r\n\r\nThe receptacle of the Lily Encrinite is smooth, and in the form of a\r\ndepressed vase; its base is composed of five plates, upon which are\r\nplaced three successive series of other plates, with the uppermost of\r\nwhich the arms articulate. The stem is formed of numerous perforated\r\nround ossicles, articulated to each other by radiated grooved surfaces,\r\nand becoming somewhat pentangular, and alternately larger and smaller,\r\ntowards the summit, to which the receptacle is fixed; a construction\r\nadmitting great freedom of motion.[278]\r\n\r\n[278] Mr. Miller's work should be consulted for details of structure.\r\n\r\nThis Encrinite when lying in relief on the rock, with its receptacle\r\nentirely or partially closed (see _Wond._ p. 548), so strikingly\r\nresembles the bud or expanding flower of a Lily or Tulip, as to justify\r\nthe popular name of Stone-lily. An exquisite specimen is figured by Mr.\r\nParkinson;[279] the British Museum possesses some fine examples.[280]\r\n\r\n[279] Pict. Atlas, pl. xlviii.\r\n\r\n[280] Petrifactions, p. 77.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkinson detected the animal membrane in ossicles of this crinoid,\r\nby immersing them in dilute hydrochloric acid.[281] My friend Mr.\r\nFrederick Harford has repeated the experiment with success.\r\n\r\n[281] See Pict. Atlas, pl. xlvii. _fig._ 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PENTACRINITES.]\r\n\r\nPentacrinites.--The description of the recent _Pentacrinus_\r\n_caput-medusæ_ (_ante_, p. 282), illustrates the characters of the\r\ncrinoideans whose fossil remains are so familiar to the palæontologist,\r\nunder the name of Pentacrinites. In these animals the pieces composing\r\nthe receptacle are firmly articulated together; the rays of the disk\r\nare fixed immediately to the summit of the column by special ossicula;\r\nand the stem is composed of angular pieces, which are generally\r\npentagonal. The receptacle is small, and situated deep between the\r\nbases of the arms; it is closed above by an integument covered by\r\nminute plates or flat ossicles (_Lign. 94, fig. 2_). The fossil\r\nremains of several species are abundant in the Lias and Oolite of\r\nDorsetshire, Somersetshire, &c. Slabs of limestone may be extracted\r\nwith the surface covered with these crinoideans, spread out as if\r\nfloating in their native element; very commonly they are transmuted\r\ninto sulphuret of iron, or have a coating of brilliant pyrites.[282] The\r\nneighbourhoods of Lyme Regis, and Charmouth, are celebrated for these\r\norganic remains. A small specimen of the arms of a pentacrinite on Lias\r\nshale is figured in _Lign. 94, fig. 3._\r\n\r\n[282] Pictorial Atlas, pl. li. lii.\r\n\r\nThe arms in many of the plumose pentacrinites are very long and thickly\r\nbeset with side-arms, and minute pinnæ, all of which are composed of\r\nseparate articulated ossicles, so that the number of bones in a single\r\nendo-skeleton of those crinoids amounts to from fifty to one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand distinct pieces. The Briarean Pentacrinite,[283] so\r\nnamed from its numerous tentacula, is literally a tuft of articulated\r\nprocesses, appearing like a delicate fibrous plume attached to a\r\nstem. The _Pentacrinus Hiemeri_ is a beautiful example of this type\r\nof crinoids, of which there is a noble group, comprising upwards of\r\nthirty individuals, on a slab in the British Museum,[284] exposed on\r\nthe surface of the stone in as perfect a state as if just dredged up\r\nfrom the bottom of the sea. The pentacrinites are for the most part\r\nentire; the peduncle being fixed, and the column extending upwards\r\nin gentle undulations, and supporting the receptacle, from which the\r\narms are gracefully outspread in various attitudes. The structure of\r\nthe receptacle, and of the arms, and the extreme delicacy of the finer\r\ntentacula made up of countless minute ossicula, are admirably shown in\r\nthis unique and most instructive fossil.\r\n\r\n[283] Pictorial Atlas, pl. xlvii. The Briarean Pentacrinite is fully\r\nillustrated and described in detail in Dr. Buckland's Bridge water\r\nEssay, p. 484.\r\n\r\n[284] This species was named and figured by M.

The base is composed of three plates which support five\r\nhexagonals and one pentagonal, and on these are three other series;\r\nfrom the upper margin of the last, five arms are given off. The\r\nreceptacle is closed by a dome-shaped tesselated covering (_Lign. 94,\r\nfig. 2_), having on one side the opening for the mouth and vent. The\r\nspecimen, _fig. 1_, is a receptacle without a stem, and with but a few\r\njoints of the arms; this is the usual state in which these fossils are\r\nobtained. _Fig. 2_ is an _Actinocrinite_ in which part of the brim of\r\nthe receptacle and of the arms has been removed in front, leaving a\r\nportion of the coalesced arms partially surrounding the proboscideal\r\nplated integument that covers the upper part of the receptacle; the\r\nfigure is from Mr. Miller's work, and is introduced to illustrate the\r\nstructure of these crinoideans.[285]\r\n\r\n[285] Miller's Crinoidea, _fig._ N. pp. 98-100.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the plates of the receptacle in the\r\nActinocrinites, is generally covered with radiated markings and\r\nridges, so that detached plates have been mistaken for those of\r\nMarsupites; see the restored figure of a Nave Encrinite, _Wond._ p.\r\n654. In some species the receptacle is richly ornamented; but in the\r\nspecimen figured, _Lign. 94, fig. 1_, the surface has been defaced in\r\nconsequence of the fossil having been immersed in strong acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyathocrinus (_Cup-like Encrinite_). _Lign. 95_, and _Lign. 92, fig.\r\n2_.--The column is formed of round, depressed, perforated joints,\r\narticulating by radiated surfaces; pentagonal near the summit.

The column is\r\ncylindrical and traversed by a pentagonal canal. The rays or arms\r\narise by a single ossicle and then bifurcate: the receptacle is\r\nformed of three, five, ten, and more numerous series of plates, which\r\nare ornamented externally. A fine example of a crinoid of this type\r\n(_Hypanthocrinus_) from the Wenlock limestone, is figured in the London\r\nPalæontological Journal, pl. xxi.\r\n\r\nIn Sir R. Murchison's Sil. Syst. all the crinoids of the Silurian\r\ndeposits, then known, are figured. Several new genera are described by\r\nProfessor McCoy, in the Synopsis of British Palæozoic Fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\nEugeniacrinus (_Clove-like Encrinite_). _Lign. 92, fig. 1._--These\r\nlittle crinoids, which resemble a clove in form, are found at Mount\r\nRanden, in Switzerland, in Oolitic limestone. The receptacle is simple\r\nin structure, for it has but one series of plates; its cavity is very\r\nsmall. It had five arms: the articulating surface of the ossicles is\r\nradiated. When perfect this crinoidean must have somewhat resembled the\r\nLily Encrinite, but the plates are all anchylosed, or blended together,\r\nwhich Mr. Miller attributed to an early stage of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PENTREMITES PYRIFORMIS.]\r\n\r\nPentremites pyriformis (_Pear-shaped angular Encrinite_). _Lign.\r\n91, fig. 2._--The column of this remarkable crinoid is short, and\r\nformed of cylindrical, perforated ossicula, with radiated surfaces,\r\nand has irregular side-arms. The receptacle is composed of polygonal\r\nplates, divided by five perforated grooves or furrows, which are of\r\nan elongated petalous form, and converge in a rosette on the summit.\r\nThe marginal longitudinal rows of minute pores are not however for the\r\npassage of soft membranous feelers, as in the ambulacra of echinoderms,\r\nas was formerly conjectured, but are channels for the transit of\r\nvessels that supply an infinite number of delicate simple tentacula,\r\ncomposed of extremely minute calcareous ossicula, as in the other\r\nCrinoidea, but not subdivided as in the Pentacrinites and Encrinites.\r\n\r\nThese articulated tentacula are arranged close together in longitudinal\r\nrows on the ambulacral spaces; there being two rows, each consisting\r\nof fifty tentacula, on every space. They are directed upwards towards\r\nthe vertex of the receptacle, and appear to be the instruments for the\r\ncapture and conveyance of food to the mouth.[287]\r\n\r\n[287] See Dr. Fred. Röemer on jointed tentacles found on the ambulacral\r\nspaces of _Pentremites_, \"Geol. Journal,\" vol. v. p. 8.\r\n\r\nThere are several species of Pentremites, some of which swarm in the\r\ncherty limestones of Kentucky. Mr. Say, to whom we are indebted for the\r\nfirst satisfactory investigation of these fossils, mentions that such\r\nis their abundance, that he has observed, on a piece of rock not larger\r\nthan three inches by two-and-a-half, above twenty specimens lying in\r\nrelief\r\n\r\n\r\nCystidea.--In the ancient fossiliferous strata there occurs a\r\nremarkable family of crinoideans, which is supposed to be restricted\r\nto the palæozoic ages; these fossils have been named by Von Buch,\r\n_Cystideæ_, from the body of the animal being wholly inclosed in a\r\ncyst, or box. The receptacle is of a spherical form, and composed of\r\npolygonal plates, articulated to each other; it has distinct apertures\r\nfor the mouth, vent, and oviduct; the orifice of the latter is closed\r\nby valves. It has a short pedicle, but no arms have been discovered,\r\nand the Cystideæ are generally described as Crinoids without appendages\r\nof this kind. But in some members of this group, there are not only\r\narms and tentacula, but likewise certain organs connected with the\r\nplates, which Prof E. Forbes terms, \"pectinated rhombs,\" the functions\r\nof which are not obvious. The arms more closely resemble those of\r\nthe Ophiuridæ than of the Crinoidea.[288] This order comprises several\r\ngenera, and is the type under which the Crinoidea first appear in\r\nthe natural records of our planet, according to the present state of\r\nour knowledge, and which becomes extinct before the advent of the\r\nPentacrinites.\r\n\r\n[288] See a memoir on the British Cystidea, by Prof. Ed.

The\r\nexamination of specimens obtained from the Chalk of Lewes and Brighton,\r\nenabled me to determine the true characters of the original; the\r\npurse-like form when the arms are closed suggested the name Marsupites\r\n(_purse-like_), by which it is now generally known; the specific name\r\n_Milleri_, is in commemoration of the late excellent and able author of\r\nthe Natural History of the Crinoidea.\r\n\r\nThe receptacle of the Marsupite is of a sub-ovate shape, and rounded\r\nand entire at the dorsal extremity; a large central plate forms\r\nits base, on which is placed a successive series of pentagonal and\r\nhexagonal plates, the margins of which are in contact, but not\r\nanchylosed nor firmly united; to the periphery of this cup are\r\narticulated five arms, which subdivide into ten rays, or tentacula. The\r\ntop of the receptacle was closed by an integument, covered by numerous\r\nsmall semilunar plates, in the centre of which was situated the oral\r\naperture. The external surfaces of the plates of the receptacle are\r\ngenerally granulated and radiated, as in _Lign. 92, fig. 3_; but in\r\nsome specimens the surface is quite smooth, a character which possibly\r\nmay be specific. Some examples have the surface granulated and rugous,\r\nand these Mr. Miller regarded as distinct, and named _M. ornatus_. I\r\nhave not of late years been able to obtain specimens to determine this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe Marsupites vary in size, from an inch to three inches in length,\r\nexclusive of the arms. The receptacle is relatively very capacious\r\ncompared with that of other crinoideans. The central plate is large,\r\nand of a pentagonal form, without the slightest indication of any\r\ncolumn or process of attachment: five pentagonal plates are united\r\nto the sides of the basal plate, and above these a like number of\r\nhexagonals, which receive the five upper plates that constitute the\r\nmargin; these have each a semilunar depression, to articulate with the\r\nfirst bones of the arms, or brachial appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 96.--Marsupites Milleri, _nat._\r\n\r\n_Chalk, Lewes._]\r\n\r\nDetached plates and ossicula of marsupites are not uncommon in the\r\nChalk of Kent and Sussex; nearly entire receptacles, filled with chalk\r\nor flint, are occasionally found in the pits near Lewes and Brighton;\r\nbut examples with remains of the arms are extremely rare; and I have\r\nseen but one specimen (which I collected from the Sussex chalk), in\r\nwhich the plates of the integument that covered the opening of the\r\nreceptacle are preserved.[289]\r\n\r\n[289] It is figured in my _South D. Foss._ pl. xvi. _fig._ 6.\r\n\r\nThe Marsupite is an exceedingly interesting type, in a zoological\r\npoint of view, since it forms a link that unites the Crinoidea with\r\nthe Comatulæ, or feather-stars, which we shall presently notice. Its\r\ngeneral form and habits are sufficiently indicated by the numerous\r\nspecimens that have been collected in the Chalk of the south-east of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe body of the animal was inclosed in a crustaceous case formed\r\nof large plates, articulated to each other by suture; the mouth or\r\noral aperture was situated in the centre of the plated integumental\r\ncover of the receptacle. The organs of locomotion and prehension\r\nconsisted of five arms or brachial appendages, formed of ossicula\r\nas in the crinoidea, and the whole was invested with soft tissue or\r\ninteguments. When floating in the water, the creature could spread\r\nout its tentacula, and form a net to capture its prey, and by closing\r\nthem, secure it, and convey it to its mouth. The figure, _Lign. 96_,\r\nis restored from specimens which separately exhibit the parts here\r\nrepresented in connexion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFossil Asteriadæ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL ASTERIADÆ.]\r\n\r\nThe radiated animals, popularly called _Star-fishes_, from their\r\nstellular forms, are so abundant on our coasts, that the common\r\nfive-rayed species must be familiar to all my readers who indulge\r\nin rambles on the sea-shore, and will serve as an illustration of\r\nthe general appearance and structure of the beings whose petrified\r\nremains now claim our attention. This species belongs to the division\r\nof Asteriadæ, in which the rays are elongated, and far exceed in\r\nlength the diameter of the disk; in another group (_Goniastea_, or\r\nCushion-star), the body is angular, and the lobes or rays are short,\r\nand not longer than the diameter; while in a third subdivision\r\n(_Comatula_ and _Ophiura_), the arms are distinct from the body, and\r\narticulated, elongated, and ramified, as in the _Crinoidea_.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the common Star-fish is soft, and attached to\r\na tough coriaceous integument, investing a skeleton composed of an\r\ninfinite number of calcareous ossicula, arranged in regular series\r\nalong the margins of the rays. Each ray has a longitudinal furrow,\r\nperforated at the sides by alternating rows of pores, through which\r\ntubular tentacula are protruded. The mouth is situated in the centre\r\nof the under surface. Now if we imagine a Star-fish placed with\r\nits mouth upwards, and the five rays fringed with long articulated\r\ntentacula, as in the Comatula, and fixed by the centre of its dorsal\r\nsurface upon a jointed stem, we shall have the essential characters\r\nof a crinoidean; and the animals of one recent tribe of _Asteriadæ_\r\nare actually in this condition in the earlier stage of their\r\nexistence: these are the _Comatulæ_, or Feather-stars, in some of\r\nwhich (the _Euryale_), the arms are as numerously subdivided as in the\r\nPentacrinites.[290]\r\n\r\n[290] The reader interested in this subject should peruse the charming\r\nvolume on British Star-fishes and other Echinoderms, by Professor\r\nEdward Forbes. 1 vol. 8vo. John Van Voorst. 1841.\r\n\r\nFrom the importance of the Crinoidea in the economy of the ancient\r\nworld, the history of the only type at present inhabiting Europe, the\r\nancient seas of which swarmed with numerous forms of these beautiful\r\ncreatures, presents many points of interest. The receptacle of the\r\nsoft body of the _Comatula_, like that of the Crinoideans, consists\r\nof a cup-shaped calcareous base, which sends off from its margin five\r\narms, that quickly subdivide, and are beset on each side with rows of\r\narticulated pinnæ; on the convexity there are also numerous slender,\r\njointed, simple, tentacula. The mouth is situated in the centre of\r\nthe area surrounded by the arms, and is capable of being elongated\r\ninto a proboscis. In the young state, the Comatulæ are attached by a\r\njointed stem to other bodies, as shown in _Lign. 91, _fig. 1_, which\r\nrepresents several of the natural size; _fig. 1a_ is an enlarged\r\nview of an individual, and closely resembles an expanded Crinoidean.\r\nThe stem is composed of about eighteen joints, which are pentangular;\r\nafter a few weeks the Feather-star becomes detached from its peduncle,\r\nand ranges the sea in freedom.[291]\r\n\r\n[291] The researches of J. V. Thompson, Esq. first brought to light\r\nthese interesting facts in the Natural History of the Comatula; this\r\neminent naturalist first observed pedunculated Comatulæ in the Cove of\r\nCork. When this discovery was first made known to me, I suspected that\r\nthe _Marsupite_ might have been pedunculated when young; but as very\r\nsmall specimens of this Crinoid are equally free from all traces of\r\na stem as the adult, I was led to relinquish that opinion: still the\r\ncollector, when searching for Crinoidean remains, should bear in mind\r\nthe possibility of this having been the case.\r\n\r\nIn the Comatulidæ, the arms are distinct from the body; these animals\r\ntherefore closely approach the Crinoideans: in the true Star-fish,\r\nthe angular processes, or arms, are an integral part of the body,\r\ncontaining a portion of the stomach, ova, &c., and are furnished with\r\nrows of pseudopodia.\r\n\r\nFossil Comatulæ have been discovered in the Solenhofen slate; and it is\r\nnot improbable that some of the numerous Crinoideans may be Asteriadæ\r\nin the early stages of development.\r\n\r\nIn another group, Asteriadæ, (named _Ophiuræ_ or Serpent-stars,) the\r\nrays are long and slender, and without grooves or tentacula, and are\r\ndistinct from the body. These organs are extremely flexuous, and in\r\nsome species beset with spines, and enable the animal to seize and\r\nentwine round its prey. The mouth is central, and there is an ovarian\r\naperture at the base of each of the five arms.\r\n\r\nThough the fossil Star-fishes comprise many extinct genera, they\r\nbelong to the same families as the recent; and Comatulæ, Ophiuræ,\r\nand Asteriadæ, occur in the Lias, Oolite, and Chalk, in considerable\r\nnumbers. Professor Edward Forbes has determined many of the British\r\nspecies, and it is to be hoped, will publish a monograph on the\r\nFossil Asteriadæ, as a companion to his delightful work on the recent\r\nStar-fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL OSSICULA OF STAR-FISHES.]\r\n\r\nFossil Ossicula of Star-fishes.--From the immense number of little\r\nbones which enter into the composition of the skeleton of a single\r\nStar-fish, and which are but slightly held together after the death of\r\nthe animal and the decomposition of the soft parts, we can understand\r\nhow layer upon layer of ossicula of Asteriadæ may have been formed at\r\nthe bottom of the cretaceous seas; as we find them in the quarries near\r\nArundel, Worthing, &c. Whoever has witnessed the hauling up of the\r\ndredge off our coasts, and seen the mass of living Star-fishes which it\r\nbrings up, as if the sea-bottom were a living bank of these Radiata,\r\nwill not be surprised at the vast quantities of their fossil remains.\r\nThis profusion of the living animals of this family, serves also to\r\naccount for the enormous amount of those kindred but extinct forms,\r\nwhose relics were the subject of investigation in the former part of\r\nthe present chapter.\r\n\r\nThe ossicula vary in shape in different parts of the skeleton, and\r\nProf. E. Forbes affirms, that the careful determination of their\r\ncharacters is of great importance, since they are the only paints of\r\nthe animals likely to be preserved, and the shape of an ossicle is as\r\ntruly indicative of a genus or species, as is that of a bone among the\r\nvertebrata. There is one ossicle situated on the side of the centre of\r\nthe disk, which is worthy of remark, because it often occurs in the\r\nchalk mingled with the debris of the rest of the skeleton, and should\r\nbe preserved by the collector. It differs from all the other bones in\r\nbeing marked with radiating grooves, and is called the madreporiform\r\ntubercle; it appears to be the analogue of the stem of the Crinoideæ,\r\nin other words, a rudimental condition of an organ, which is fully\r\ndeveloped in that order of radiata.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPHIURA.]\r\n\r\nOphiura. _Lign. 97, fig. 1._--Several species of this genus, which is\r\ndistinguished by the long, slender, serpent-like arms, and the circular\r\ndisk covered with plates and spines, have been found in a fossil state:\r\none species was discovered in the Lower Silurian deposits by Prof.\r\nSedgwick, and other forms have been obtained from all the succeeding\r\nformations. The Lias near Lyme Regis and Charmouth has yielded many\r\nbeautiful examples of _Ophiura Egertoni_. Professor John Phillips has\r\nfigured a species (_Oph. Milleri_, Geol. York, pl. xiii.) from the\r\nmarlstone of Yorkshire, and a species from the Oxford Clay has been\r\ndescribed as _Ophiura Prattii_. In the Cretaceous formation, remains\r\nof several species have been found. The first specimen from the Sussex\r\nChalk that came under my notice, was discovered many years since, by\r\nmy son, in a quarry at Preston, near Brighton; the rays were admirably\r\npreserved, as shown in the portion figured in _Lign. 97._ An example\r\nof this species, with the disk entire, and portions of five arms, was\r\nfound by Henry Catt, Esq. and is represented in pl. xxiii. _fig._ 2, of\r\nMr. Dixon's work.[KF]\r\n\r\n[292] Three plates are devoted to the Cretaceous Star-fishes: the\r\ndescriptions by Prof. E. Forbes comprise twenty-five species, belonging\r\nto the genera Oreaster, Goniaster, Stellaster, Arthraster, and Ophiura,\r\nall from the Chalk of Sussex and Kent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 97.

The upper surface is nodulose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 98. Fossil Star-fish. _Chalk, Kent._ Goniaster\r\nMantelli. (_sp Forbes._[293])]\r\n\r\n[293] Dixon's Cret. Foss. p. 332.\r\n\r\nThe detached ossicula of the skeletons of Cushion-stars are frequent\r\nin the White Chalk; and the large central bone, the _madreporiform\r\ntubercle_, which is present in the dorsal aspect of all star-fishes,\r\nis large, and therefore often observed, and may be easily mistaken for\r\nthe base of a crinoidean receptacle. The layers in the Sussex Chalk\r\ncomposed of the exuviæ of star-fishes, as previously mentioned, are\r\nchiefly made up of ossicula of goniasters.\r\n\r\nThere are two species not uncommon in the Chalk, of which portions may\r\ngenerally be obtained from the pits near Gravesend; and occasionally\r\nvery fine examples of the entire goniaster are met with. Mr. Dixon's\r\nwork contains figures of several exquisite fossils of this kind. These\r\norganic remains were familiar to the early collectors: Mr. Parkinson\r\nfigures several in Org. Rem. vol. iii. pl. i. and ii.[294]\r\n\r\n[294] Pict. Atlas, pl. liii.\r\n\r\n_Goniaster Hunteri_ (_Lign. 97_), has the body obtusely pentagonal, and\r\nthe sides nearly straight; the superior intermediate marginal plates\r\nare four, equal, broadly oblong, coarsely mamillato-punctate; the\r\nossicula of the disk hexagonal.[295] This species is common in the upper\r\nchalk.\r\n\r\n[295] Prof. Forbes, Dixon's Cret. Foss. p. 331.\r\n\r\nIn _Goniaster Mantelli_, _Lign. 98_, the body is pentagonal, but the\r\nsides are curved, with projecting angles; the ossicula of the disk\r\nare punctated. The superior intermediate marginal plates are oblong,\r\nnarrow, punctate, marginate, and six in number.[296]\r\n\r\n[296] Ibid. p. 332.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of these Goniasters are sometimes met with attached to a\r\nnodule of flint, in an extraordinary state of freshness; sharp imprints\r\nof the external surface, the skeleton having perished, are also found\r\nin flints, and, rarely, casts in pyrites. The whetstone of Dorsetshire\r\noften bears distinct moulds of Goniasters! I have found ossicula of\r\nthis form of Star-fish in the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsterias. _Lign. 99._--The animals of this genus, of which the common\r\nStar-fish is the type, are stellate in form; the rays are flat, and\r\nextend from the body, of which they are a prolongation--not mere\r\nappendages. They have deep grooves or furrows bordered by marginal\r\nplates, which are continued to the extremities.\r\n\r\nThe Lias of Germany has yielded several species of Asterias; one of\r\nwhich is figured, _Lign. 99_. A very large species occurs in the\r\nCornbrash of the Oolite of England. A magnificent specimen of _Asterias\r\narenicola_ (Goldfuss), from the calcareous grit, near Pickering,\r\nYorkshire, measuring 10-1/2 inches from the extremity of one ray to\r\nthat of another, is figured in the London Palæontological Journal, pl.\r\nxvii. The same work contains admirable figures of _Ophiura Egertoni_,\r\nand _Oph. senatu_ in flint, pl. xix.; _Oph. Milleri_ in Staithes\r\nmarlstone, and _Oph. Murravii_, pl. xx.; and two specimens of _Oph.\r\nMilleri_ on the same slab of Lias from Staithes, near Whitby, pl. viii.\r\n\r\nThe Star-fishes of the British palæozoic strata are described by Prof.\r\nE. Forbes in the Memoirs of the Geol. Survey, _Decad._ 1.[297]\r\n\r\n[297] See also Prof. M'Coy's Lower Palæozoic Fossils, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 99.

In the palæozoic seas--including the Silurian, Devonian,\r\nCarboniferous, and Permian--the Crinoidea were represented by upwards\r\nof fifty genera, whose existence began and ended during that geological\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the present state of our knowledge all those peculiar\r\ntypes of radiated animals were created, and each lived through the\r\ndestined period alloted to its race, and died out ere the deposition\r\nof the New Red Sandstone; not a single species, not a relic of the\r\ninnumerable individuals that swarmed in the palæozoic oceans, has been\r\nobserved in any strata above the Permian.\r\n\r\nThe Trias, which ranks as the earliest of the secondary formations, is\r\ncharacterized by the advent of two typical genera; the true Encrinus or\r\nLily-encrinite, and the Pentacrinus; the former is unknown in any other\r\ndeposits; the duration of its race was comprised within the Triassic\r\nepoch. The Pentacrinus, on the other hand, has been perpetuated through\r\nall the succeeding periods, and one species inhabits the present seas;\r\nthe sole existing representative of the most ancient type of this order.\r\n\r\nIn the Oolite, another living form, the Comatula, first appears.\r\n\r\nThe ocean of the Cretaceous epoch was inhabited by five genera of\r\nCrinoids, unknown elsewhere; among them is that remarkable genus, the\r\nMarsupite.\r\n\r\nThe Crinoidea of the Tertiary seas are as few in number and variety as\r\nthose of the present day; not a vestige of any of the ancient tribes\r\nhas been discovered. M. D'Orbigny's _Tab._ 12 presents the phenomena\r\nthus briefly noticed, in a striking point of view.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this review of the fossil Crinoidea and Asteriadæ, the student\r\nwill be in some measure prepared for the collecting of instructive\r\nspecimens from the immense accumulation of remains imbedded in certain\r\nstrata of the Oolitic, Liassic, Carboniferous and Silurian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe British species of fossil Crinoidea amount to more than two\r\nhundred, and when the great number of bones that enter into the\r\ncomposition of the skeleton of a single Pentacrinite or Encrinite is\r\nconsidered, the prodigious quantity of the fossil remains of these\r\nzoophytes in the ancient deposits may be readily conceived. Polished\r\nslices of the encrinital marbles of Derbyshire, and of the Lias\r\nlimestones from Lyme Regis and Charmouth, should be obtained, as they\r\nshow sections of the imbedded crinoidal stems and detached ossicula;\r\nand sometimes of the receptacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL ECHINIDÆ, OR SEA-URCHINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 100. Turban Echinus, with its spines; 1/2 _nat._\r\n\r\n(_Hemicidaris crenularis, Agassiz._)\r\n\r\n_Jura limestone._]\r\n\r\nThe fossils we have now to examine are among the most familiar of the\r\nobjects commonly known as petrifactions; for as the enveloping cases\r\nof the Echini possess considerable durability, they have served as\r\nmoulds into which silex, calc-spar, limestone, pyrites, and other\r\nmineral substances, when in solution, or in a semi-fluid state, have\r\npercolated, and formed sharp and enduring casts, which exhibit the\r\nforms of the plates, and the disposition of the pores, striæ, &c. of\r\nthe original structures.\r\n\r\nThe common Echinus of our sea-coasts (_Echinus sphæra_), known by the\r\nname of Sea-egg, Sea-urchin, or Sea-hedgehog, presents the typical\r\ncharacters of this order of Radiata, which differs from the Crinoids\r\nand Star-fishes in the absence of arms.\r\n\r\nThe calcareous envelope of the Echinus, or shell, as it is popularly\r\ncalled, is composed of many calcareous, polygonal plates, closely\r\nfitted to each other, and arranged in regular and elegant patterns;\r\nappearing in the globular and spherical kinds like the lines of the\r\nmeridian on a globe. The plates are disposed in ten vertical series,\r\nunited by serrated sutures, and form sections, into which the envelope\r\nor case very commonly separates upon the decay of the investing\r\ninteguments. Of the ten bands five are large and five small. The large\r\nbands (_areæ_) are each composed of a double row of plates, ornamented\r\nwith tubercles supporting large spines (_Lign. 100_). The five narrower\r\nbands consist of much smaller plates, and the spines are minute, or\r\naltogether wanting; hence these bands appear like avenues through the\r\nspinous tracks, and have therefore been fancifully termed ambulacra\r\nor walks. They are the equivalents of the grooves or furrows of the\r\nStar-fishes (_Lign. 108, a_.); and are traversed by numerous pores,\r\nfor the exsertion of tubular feet, or tentacula. Besides these rows\r\nof minute openings, there are two principal apertures, the mouth and\r\nthe outlet or vent; and also a few large pores, commonly five, on the\r\nsummit, for the exclusion of the ova, and the free admission of water.\r\n\r\nThe form and relative position of the parts above described, afford\r\ncharacters by which the order is divided into genera. The mouth, which\r\nis situated on the lower part, is in some species furnished with five\r\nsharp angular teeth, attached to a calcareous framework that admits\r\nof being protruded; this apparatus, when entire, commonly bears the\r\nname of \"_Diogenes' lantern_.\" The eminences on the surface of the\r\nplates vary in size from mere granules, or papillæ, to large mamillated\r\ntubercles; they serve for the attachment of movable spines, which also\r\npresent great variety of form and ornament. The spines have a cup-like\r\ncavity at the base which fits on the papillæ, and in many species are\r\nonly supported by the capsular envelopment of the common integument;\r\nbut in others, the large spines are attached by a ligament which passes\r\nfrom the centre of the socket, and is received in a perforation of the\r\npapilla of each tubercle, in the same manner as the _ligamentum teres_\r\nof the human thigh-bone. Transverse slices of the spines exhibit the\r\ninternal structure, and are beautiful objects under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThere are also minute appendages to the integument, called\r\n_pedicellariæ_, or pinchers, of a very remarkable character, whose\r\nfunctions are not known. They are slender columnar bodies, each crowned\r\nwith three calcareous teeth-like spines, beautifully sculptured, and\r\nwhich in some species are long and slender, in others short and obtuse.\r\nI have not observed any traces of these bodies, even in the best\r\npreserved echinites, but as they are as durable as the spines and case,\r\nthey may exist in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TURBAN ECHINITES.]\r\n\r\nThis general view of the structure of the recent Echinites will enable\r\nthe student to understand the nature of the fossil remains; for the\r\nparts above described, are found more or less perfectly preserved,\r\neither in their natural arrangement, or separated and dispersed in\r\nthe rock. The habits of these animals, of burrowing in the sand, were\r\nfavourable to their preservation in a mineralized state; and in some\r\nof the oolitic limestones, hundreds of beautiful examples of Turban\r\nEchinites (_Cidares_), having their spines spread out on the face of\r\nthe rock, are found lying in the positions they evidently occupied\r\nwhen living. The quarries near Calne and Chippenham, in Wilts, are\r\ncelebrated for such fossils.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to give figures of the genera into which the\r\nnumerous fossil species have been divided by modern authors: but\r\nI found the attempt hopeless, from the changes in nomenclature and\r\narrangement which are constantly taking place. The monographs on the\r\nfossil Echinidæ, by Prof. E. Forbes, now in course of publication by\r\nthe Government School of Mines, will, when completed, place this branch\r\nof Palæontology on a satisfactory basis.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of study, the fossil Echini may be separated into\r\nthree principal groups; viz. the Cidaritidæ, or Turban Echinites; the\r\nClypeasteridæ, or Buckler-shaped Echinites; and the Spatangidæ, or\r\nHeart-shaped Echinites.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIDARITIDÆ.]\r\n\r\nCidaritidæ. _Turban Echinites._--In these sea-urchins the vent is\r\nsituated on the summit of the shell, and is surrounded by five minute\r\napertures for the exclusion of the ova. The mouth, or oral aperture,\r\nis placed directly opposite, in the middle of the base, or inferior\r\nsurface. The mouth is large, and furnished with a powerful apparatus,\r\narmed with teeth; which is sometimes found fossil (see _fig._ 1, 3,\r\n_Lign. 101_). The structure of the animal, in consequence of the\r\nsymmetrical position of the two chief outlets of the shells, is\r\nstrictly radiated; that is, all the parts proceed from, or are arranged\r\naround one common centre. The tubercles are larger and fewer than in\r\nthe other tribes of this family; they support long and powerful spines,\r\nwhich vary much in form and ornament in different species (see _Lign.\r\n102_). The larger tubercles and spines are beset with smaller ones,\r\ndisposed in regular series.\r\n\r\nThe Turban Echinites are the most ancient types of the order, some\r\nforms appearing in the Carboniferous deposit. The species are very\r\nnumerous. The echinites of this group are subdivided into four tribes:\r\n\r\n1. _Cidares_, properly so called.--In these the tubercles are\r\nperforated; the ambulacra narrow, and beset with granular tubercles,\r\nand the two lines of pores are close together. The pseudopodia can be\r\nprotruded to a great length, even beyond the spines, so as to reach\r\nobjects the latter could not touch.\r\n\r\n2. _Echini_, which differ from the above in the tubercles being\r\nimperforate, and the ambulacral area wide: the spines and tubes are of\r\na moderate size.\r\n\r\n3. _Diademæ._--The tubercles are perforated, and the ambulacra wide and\r\nstudded with large tubercles.\r\n\r\n4. _Saleniæ._--The tubercles are imperforate, and relatively large; the\r\nchief distinction is a solid ovarian disk on the summit, composed of\r\nseveral large flat plates, anchylosed together.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Turban Echinites is composed of twenty vertical series\r\nof plates, the ambulacra, or porous grooves, forming continuous bands\r\nfrom the summit to the mouth, which is armed with five angular teeth.\r\nThis tribe comprises many of the most elegant fossil species; those\r\nwhich, from their shape and highly ornamented surface, have received\r\nthe popular name of Fairy's night-caps. The genus _Cidaris_, which\r\nis characterized by perforated spinous tubercles, affords the most\r\nbeautiful examples, and these are occasionally found with the spines\r\nin contact; a circumstance less rare than might be supposed, when the\r\nnature of the attachment of these organs is considered; for, upon the\r\ndecomposition of the integument, and the ligaments which connect the\r\nspines with the tubercles in a living state, these appendages quickly\r\nfall off, even in recent specimens.\r\n\r\nThe interesting fossil figured _Lign. 100_ (_ante_, p. 311), is a\r\nchoice example of a Cidarite with the spines attached. This species\r\n(_Hemicidaris crenularis_, _Agassiz_) is said to be characteristic\r\nof the Upper Jura limestone of Switzerland, and was supposed to be\r\nidentical with Mr. Parkinson's _Cidaris parpillata var._ (_Pict.\r\nAtlas_, pl. lvi. _fig._ 6), from Calne, in Wiltshire; but spines like\r\nthose of _Lign. 100_, do not occur in the English oolite. These spines\r\nare not homogeneous throughout; the central part appears to have\r\nbeen of a less dense tissue than the outer coat, as is shown in the\r\nfractured spine in the figure. This structure does not exist in the\r\nspines of the depressed Turban Echinites, but is stated by M. Agassiz\r\nto prevail in all the species of the genus _Hemicidaris_, of which the\r\nfossil figured in _Lign. 100_ is the type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 101.

It is this cidarite which occurs in such immense numbers in\r\nthe Oolite at Calne, Chippenham, Faringdon, &c. Slabs of limestone\r\nare occasionally extracted from the quarries at Calne, with more than\r\nthirty of these echinites surrounded by their spines. I have one\r\nspecimen, attached to a block of limestone, with fifty spines; but it\r\nis difficult to detach a perfect spine.\r\n\r\n[298] Mr. Woodward. I am indebted to this gentleman for many valuable\r\nremarks on fossil Echinoderms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIDARIS BLUMENBACHII.]\r\n\r\nCidaris Blumenbachii. _Lign. 127, fig. 3._--This is another beautiful\r\ncharacteristic Turban Echinite of the Oolite. The tubercles are very\r\nlarge and prominent, and the spines remarkably neat, being covered with\r\nlongitudinal granulated striæ; they are of an elongated cucumerine\r\nform, and homogeneous in structure (_Lign. 127, fig. 5_). They occur\r\nby hundreds in some of the layers of friable stone in the quarries\r\naround Calne.\r\n\r\nMany species of Turban Echinites abound in the White Chalk, especially\r\nnear Gravesend, Northfleet, Purfleet, Charlton, and other places\r\nin Kent; the softness of the cretaceous strata in those localities\r\nrendering the removal of the chalk an easy task. Splendid specimens,\r\nwith the spines and tubercles almost as fresh as if recent, have\r\nrewarded the patience and skill of collectors. The British Museum\r\ncontains many fine examples, especially a specimen of _Cidaris\r\nclavigera_ from Charlton, with sixteen spines, and the dental apparatus\r\n_in situ_.[299]\r\n\r\n[299] Several coloured figures of Cidarites and spines are given in\r\nPict, Atlas, pl. liii. and lvi. A fine series of Chalk specimens are\r\nfigured in Dixon's Fossils, tab. xxv.; many from the choice cabinet of\r\nHenry Catt, Esq. of Brighton.\r\n\r\nThe collection of Chalk Cidarites with their spines, formed by W. H.\r\nTaylor, Esq. F.G.S., of Winterslow-place, Brixton, is the most splendid\r\nassemblage of these fossils I have seen.\r\n\r\nDiadema. _Lign. 101, fig. 4, 6._--The shell in this genus is of\r\na more depressed form than in Cidaris; there are two rows of large\r\ntubercles, which are crenulated and perforated, on the ambulacra as\r\nwell as on the interambulacral spaces. The spines are slender and\r\nannulated. Mr. Woodward remarks that the common Chalk species referred\r\nby authors to this genus, belong to the sub-genus _Cyphosoma_ of M.\r\nAgassiz, in which the tubercles are imperforate. There are nearly fifty\r\nfossil species known, and they range from the Lias to the Chalk. The\r\nrecent analogues inhabit the seas of warm regions.\r\n\r\nEchinus.--The shells of the genus Echinus resemble those of Cidaris in\r\ntheir general structure, but the tubercles are imperforate. More than\r\ntwenty fossil species are described, from the Oolite and Chalk.\r\n\r\nSalenia.--In the greensand pits near Faringdon, in Berkshire, which\r\nabound in fossil sponges and other poriferæ (_ante_, p. 228), there are\r\nimmense numbers of a small elegant Turban Echinite, which belongs to\r\nthe genus thus named by the eminent zoologist. Dr. J. E. Gray, of the\r\nBritish Museum. The collector will easily recognize these sea-urchins\r\nby the plated summit. The shell has five ovarian and five interovarian\r\nplates, and an eleventh or odd one. The tubercles are crenulated. The\r\ncommon species at Faringdon is _S. petalifera_, of Desmarest. Two\r\nspecies of this genus, viz. _S. scutigera_ and _S. stellulata_, from\r\nnear Warminster, are figured in _Pict. Atlas_, pl. liii. _fig._ 12, 13.\r\n\r\n_Cidarites of New Zealand._--Detached plates and spines of sea-urchins,\r\nbelonging to the family Cidaritidæ, have been discovered by Mr.\r\nWalter Mantell, in the Ototara limestone of New Zealand; which is a\r\nfawn-coloured stone, composed of foraminiferæ, like the Chalk, and\r\ncontaining terebratulæ, corals, and teeth of sharks.[300]\r\n\r\n[300] Geol. Journal, vol. vi. p. 319.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPINES OF CIDARITES.]\r\n\r\nSpines of Cidarites. _Lign. 102._--Allusion has been made to the\r\nimmense numbers of the spines of two or three kinds of Cidarites that\r\noccur in the oolitic limestones of certain localities. The spines of\r\nother species and genera abound in the Chalk, Greensand, &c.; occurring\r\ndetached and intermingled with corals, shells, and the usual fossils of\r\nthose deposits. There is great variety in the form, size, and sculpture\r\nof these organs. In the subjoined _Lign. 102_, a few distinct kinds are\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 102.

A specimen of this kind is\r\nrepresented in _Lign. 101, fig. 5_. Casts of the larger Cidarites are\r\noften seen on the ploughed lands of the South Downs, in beds of gravel,\r\nand among the shingle on the sea-shore of chalk districts; appearing\r\nas flattened spherical bodies, with a circular protuberance at each\r\npole, and vertical rows of nodular projections. Impressions of the\r\nexternal surface of the cases are also frequent on chalk-flints, and\r\nexhibit exquisite casts, in intaglio, of the mamillated tubercles, and\r\nambulacral grooves and pores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 103.

The perforations around the imprint\r\nindicate tubular cavities in the flinty formed by the spines, and show\r\nthat these processes were attached to the shell when the latter was\r\nenveloped by the fluid silex; the case and the spines having since\r\nperished. But in the Chalk, exquisite specimens of Cidarites occur with\r\nthe case perfect, and filled with flint: examples of this kind are\r\noften attached to a nodule by the slender column of silex that fills up\r\nthe aperture of the shell. The mineralized condition of the originally\r\nfriable calcareous cases of Cidarites and other Echini, is worthy of\r\nattention: for whether the shell or spines be imbedded in chalk, flint,\r\nor pyrites, if the structure and form remain, the constituent substance\r\nis invariably opaque crystallized carbonate of lime, having an oblique\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\nAs this conversion of a crustaceous envelope into calc-spar is\r\nconstant, it has probably resulted from the peculiar nature of the\r\noriginal animal structures; but the cause of such transmutation is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CIDARITIDÆ OF THE PALÆOZOIC ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nCidaritidæ of the Palæozoic Rocks.--Three genera of this family,\r\ncomprising several species, have been discovered in the carboniferous\r\nlimestone of Northumberland and Ireland. One genus is undistinguishable\r\nfrom Cidaris; and the species are placed under that name in Mr.\r\nMorris's Cat. Brit. Foss.\r\n\r\nThese fossils have been figured and described by Prof. John Phillips,\r\nand Col. Portlock. Prof. M'Coy, with his accustomed penetration and\r\nsagacity, has ascertained, that notwithstanding the general resemblance\r\nbetween the Cidarites of the secondary and those of the palæozoic\r\nformations, the latter are constructed on an entirely different plan.\r\nIn the turban echini of the secondary, tertiary, and modern seas,\r\nthe interambulacral plates always consist of _two_ rows; but in the\r\npalæozoic Cidarites there are _three_ or some greater odd number of\r\nthese plates. This eminent naturalist, therefore, places the earliest\r\ntype of Echinidæ at present known in the order _Perischoechinidæ_.\r\nThe case is spheroidal, formed of more than twenty rows of plates;\r\nfive ambulacra composed of two rows of pentagonal plates each; rows of\r\ninterambulacral plates, three, five, or more, terminating dorsally in\r\nfive large pentagonal ovarian plates.\r\n\r\nAs in the more recent forms, these Cidarites are separable into\r\ntwo groups or families; one in which the spiniferous tubercles are\r\nimperforate as in the Echinus (_Palæchinidæ_ of M'Coy); the other\r\nwith numerous small secondary tubercles and a few large primary\r\nones, perforated for the ligament of the spine as in Cidaris (the\r\n_Archæocidaridæ_ of M'Coy).[301]\r\n\r\n[301] Prof. Sedgwick's \"British Palæozoic Fossils,\" p. 124.\r\n\r\nClypeastridæ.--The shell in this family of sea-urchins, is oblong or\r\nrounded; the mouth is of an angular form, and situated in the middle\r\nof the base or inferior face; it is furnished with well-developed\r\ndental organs. The outlet is distant from the summit. The tubercles\r\nare mere granulations, and the spines proportionally small. This group\r\nis subdivided into two tribes: the Galeritidæ (_helmet-like_), and the\r\nClypeideæ (_buckler-like_).\r\n\r\nGalerites albo-galerus. _Lign. 104._--The tribe of which this genus is\r\nthe type has the shell inflated, orbicular, oblong, or pentangular.\r\nThe ambulacra are simple, never petaloid; the poriferous zones extend\r\nuninterruptedly from the summit to the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the species figured _Lign. 104, fig. 1_, the shell is of a\r\nconical form, in some varieties subpentagonal; narrowest at the hinder\r\npart. The mouth is of a decagonal shape, and armed with teeth: it is\r\nsituated in the centre of the base (_Lign. 104, fig, 1a_); the outlet\r\nis near the posterior margin of the base. The surface of the shell\r\nis covered with granulations irregularly distributed. This species,\r\nwhich received the name of _albo-galerus_, from its fancied resemblance\r\nto the white conical caps of the priests of Jupiter, occurs in great\r\nnumbers and perfection in the Kentish chalk; it is less common in that\r\nof Sussex. Siliceous casts of the shell are constantly found among the\r\ndrift and gravel, and on the ploughed lands of chalk districts; they\r\nare popularly termed \"_sugar-loaves_.\" The specimens obtained from the\r\nchalk, when filled with flint, yield exquisite casts, if the shell be\r\ndissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid; by this means the form of the\r\nplates, and casts of the minutest ambulacral pores are obtained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ECHINITES FROM THE CHALK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 104.

(_M.

These echinites\r\nare placed by M. Desor in the genus of which an example is figured in\r\n_Lign. 105_.\r\n\r\nThe shell is hemispherical, and circular; the base flat; the tubercles\r\nare disposed in series; the inside of the case is supported by ribs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISCOIDEA CASTANEA.]\r\n\r\nDiscoidea (_Galerites_) castanea. _Lign. 106._--The Galeritidæ, which\r\nhave a polygonal mouth, with the tubercles disposed in vertical rows\r\nfrom the summit to the centre of the base, as in the Cidarites, instead\r\nof being uniformly spread over the surface, as in _G. albo-galerus_,\r\nare placed in the genus _Discoidea_, by M. Agassiz.\r\n\r\nA species, in which the mouth is pentagonal, and the outlet on the\r\nmargin, occurs in the Chalk-marl of Sussex, Dorset, and the Alps; a\r\nspecimen is figured in _Lign. 106_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 106.

The ambulacra do\r\nnot extend to the mouth. The shell is generally of a depressed form;\r\nand the petaloid ambulacra in many species appear like an elegant star,\r\nrichly fretted, spread over the shell. There are numerous species of\r\nthis type, both recent and fossil; many of the latter, being of a large\r\nsize, are beautiful objects in a cabinet of petrifactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nClypeus sinuatus (_Pict. Atlas_, pl. liv. _fig._ 1).--Of this genus,\r\nwhich is the type of the tribe, a large species, _C. sinuatus_, is\r\nvery common in the Oolite of Wilts, Gloucestershire, and Oxfordshire,\r\nand must be familiar to collectors. The shell is circular, and much\r\ndepressed; and has five petaloid ambulacra: the odd interambulacral\r\narea forms a deep furrow in which the outlet is situated: the mouth is\r\nmedian, pentagonal, and surrounded by a strong margin. The coloured\r\nfigures in _Pict. Atlas_, pl. liv. will enable the student to recognize\r\nthese fossils without difficulty. Splendid specimens of an allied\r\nform (_Clypeaster_) occur in the tertiary limestone of Malta, (_Pict.\r\nAtlas_, pl. lvi. fig. 7,) and are not uncommon in collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nNucleolites (_Wond._ p. 328).--There is a small type belonging to\r\nthis family, of which several species are so abundant in the Oolite,\r\nGreensand, and Chalk-marl, that a brief notice of their characters may\r\nbe useful. The shell is oblong and inflated, rounded in front and flat\r\nbehind. The pores are united by grooves; the outlet is in a deep furrow\r\non the superior face; the mouth is sub-central. One species occurs in\r\nthe Tertiary strata, and there is a recent species inhabits the seas of\r\nAustralia. There are coloured figures of Nucleolites in _Pict. Atlas_,\r\npl. liv. fig. 5, pl. lv. figs. 6, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpatangidæ.--In this tribe of echinites, the case is oblong or\r\ncordiform. The mouth, elongated transversely and destitute of proper\r\njaws, is situated in front of the centre of the base, near the\r\nanterior border of the periphery. The outlet is towards the posterior\r\nmargin. The tubercles and spines are very small. Four subdivisions are\r\nestablished, namely,--\r\n\r\n1. _Ananchytes_.--A thick and oval shell; the ambulacra simple and\r\nconverging towards the summit; the mouth transverse; the outlet is\r\nsituated on the inferior face. (_Lign. 104, fig. 2._)\r\n\r\n2. _Spatangus._--This name is now restricted to those Spatangidæ in\r\nwhich the ambulacra are petaloid, the external row of pores slightly\r\nelongated, and the inner rows round.\r\n\r\n3. _Micraster._--By this term are now distinguished the Spatangidæ\r\nwhich have the ambulacra depressed, and the shell cordiform. The\r\npores of the even ambulacra are united by a furrow. The vent is on\r\nthe posterior face. The common chalk Spatangus belongs to this genus.\r\n(_Lign. 107._)\r\n\r\n4. _Holaster._--The shells are heart-shaped; the ambulacra simple, and\r\nconverging towards the summit; the mouth is transverse; the outlet is\r\nwithin the posterior face.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANANCHYTES OVATUS.]\r\n\r\nAnanchytes ovatus. _Lign. 104. fig. 2._--These sea urchins are among\r\nthe most characteristic of the fossils of the Upper Chalk, and are\r\npeculiar to the Cretaceous formation. They are readily distinguished by\r\ntheir elevated helmet-like form, and by the transverse mouth and oblong\r\noutlet situated on the inferior face of the flat base, and towards the\r\nmargin. (_Lign. 104. fig. 2^a._)\r\n\r\nThe vernacular names of \"_Shepherd's Crown_,\" and \"_Fairy Loaf_,\"\r\nindicate the form of these abundant fossils. The shell is oval in its\r\nlongest diameter; flat, or nearly so, below; and rounded, conical,\r\nand somewhat laterally compressed towards the summit. The ambulacra\r\nare five, between double lines of pores; the tubercles are minute and\r\nscattered; the substance of the shell is of great thickness. More than\r\ntwenty species of the genus are known.\r\n\r\nThe helmet Echinites, like the preceding, have given rise to\r\ninnumerable siliceous casts, which are found associated with those\r\nof other forms in the Drift, on the ploughed lands, and among the\r\nshingle on the sea-shore; they are often placed as ornaments on the\r\nmantel-shelves of the cottagers. A flint cast of an Ananchyte, in which\r\nthe plates were partially separated, is represented _Lign. 103, fig.\r\n1_. The shells are sometimes filled with pyrites; and occasionally\r\nare found partially empty, with crystals of calc-spar symmetrically\r\narranged on the inside of the shell, parallel with the rows of\r\nambulacral pores. _Lign. 103, fig. 3_, is a remarkable example, in\r\nwhich flint occupies the base of the shell, while the upper surface is\r\nlined with crystals of calcareous spar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 107.

This type of Spatangidæ are\r\nmore or less oval, elongated, and heart-shaped, wider before than\r\nbehind, with a sulcus, or furrow, in front. The shell is fragile,\r\nand composed of large polygonal plates; the tubercles small and\r\nirregularly distributed; the spines are short. The mouth is transverse,\r\nsituated anteriorly, and protected by a strong projection of the odd\r\ninterambulacrum, which is named the lip. The vent is terminal, and\r\nplaced above the margin. There are but four ambulacra, and these\r\nare incomplete, comparatively of small extent, and situated in deep\r\nfurrows. A large and new species of Micraster (_M. cor-bovis_, of Prof.\r\nE. Forbes), from the Sussex Chalk, is figured in Dixon's _Fossils_, pl.\r\nxxiv. figs. 3, 4, p. 342.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOXASTER COMPLANATUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 108.

Agassiz denominates true\r\nSpatangi, but converge to a point on the summit, as is shown in _fig._\r\n2; the external rows of pores are elongated horizontally, and form a\r\nkind of furrow. The odd ambulacrum is in a deep groove. The mouth is\r\ntransverse, _fig._ 3, _d_; and at the anterior part of the inferior\r\nface there is a depression, which results from the convergence of the\r\nambulacral areæ towards that point. The vent is in the posterior face.\r\nThis species is from the _Neocomian_ strata of France; I introduce it\r\nto illustrate the characters of several other echinites, which the\r\nFrench geologists suppose to be confined to the so-called Neocomian\r\nformation; but which also occur in the Upper Greensand of Blackdown.\r\n\r\nHolaster is another genus of Spatangidæ established by M. Agassiz, for\r\nthose echinites that are heart-shaped, with simple ambulacra converging\r\ntowards the summit. The mouth is elongated transversely; the outlet is\r\non the posterior face. A specimen first described in my _Foss. S. D._\r\n(_pl._ xvii. _fig._ 9, 21), as Spatangus planus, is common in the Lower\r\nChalk, and Chalk-marl, and abundant in the Firestone Malm-rock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur limits will not allow of a more extended notice of the fossil\r\n_Echinidæ_. The student should consult the Memoirs on the genera,\r\nnow in course of publication at the Government School of Mines, by\r\nProfessor Edward Forbes; the plates are exquisite, as works of art, and\r\nthe descriptions all that can be desired.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon's work contains three excellent plates of cretaceous\r\nEchinites. Several chalk species are figured in my Foss. South Down.\r\nThe numerous coloured figures of fossil sea-urchins in the Pictorial\r\nAtlas of Organic Remains, have already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nGeological Distribution of Echinites.--No vestiges of this order\r\nof radiata have been discovered in the Silurian deposits: the\r\nearliest known occurrence of any type is in the Carboniferous\r\nformation. The most ancient Echinidæ, according to the present state\r\nof our knowledge, are the Cidares, in the modified form previously\r\nnoticed,--_Archæocidaridæ_ (_ante_, p. 322).\r\n\r\nIn the Trias another type appears, _Hemicidaris_, which holds an\r\nintermediate place between the Cidarites properly so called and the\r\nDiadema.\r\n\r\nIn the Oolite, and Jurassic formations, numerous forms are for the\r\nfirst time met with, constituting the genera Echinus, _Clypeus_,\r\n_Disaster_, _Holectypus_, Diadema, Nucleolites, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous seas swarmed with echini belonging to genera of which\r\nno traces have been found in earlier rocks; viz. Holaster, _Salenia_,\r\n_Micraster_, Salerites, Discoidea, _Ananchytes_, Cassidulus, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the Tertiary formations, Spatangus, Scutella, Clypeaster, and other\r\nnew genera appear, and many of the ancient ones are absent; or at least\r\nhave not been observed. Of the genera printed above in italics, no\r\nliving species are known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL ECHINODERMATA.]\r\n\r\nOn collecting and developing fossil Echinodermata.--In the previous\r\nremarks on the fossil remains of radiated animals, we have pointed\r\nout those remains that are the most important and instructive, and\r\nshould be sought for by the student. Thus, in collecting Crinoids, the\r\nreceptacle or body should be the principal object of research, and if\r\nonly detached plates can be extracted from the rock, their relative\r\nposition should be carefully noted, and the specimens glued to a card\r\nor board, in their natural order; and some of the ossicula of the\r\ncolumn, and of the arms, or tentacula, be placed with them.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller dissected specimens of every genus, and has figured\r\nthe separate plates or bones that enter into the composition of\r\nthe receptacle,[302] and arms. Traces of the tentacula, and their\r\nsubdivisions, must be sought for, and if discovered, should be removed\r\nwith the stone to which they are attached, and the block be afterwards\r\nreduced in size by a mason's saw, and not by the blows of a hammer,\r\nwhich might displace the ossicula.\r\n\r\n[302] Natural History of the Crinoidea.\r\n\r\nIf imbedded in Lias shale, or other fragile material, a thick slab\r\nshould be removed, for greater safety in conveyance; this, when reduced\r\nto a convenient size and thinness, may be imbedded in a tray with\r\nplaster of Paris, or glued to a piece of thin, well-seasoned mahogany,\r\nor deal. The specimens of the _Pear Encrinite_ of Bradford, and of the\r\nPentacrinites from Lyme Regis, in the British Museum,[303] were prepared\r\nin this manner.\r\n\r\n[303] Petrifactions, p. 78.\r\n\r\nThe crinoideal remains in Chalk belong but to few genera; they merely\r\nrequire the usual manipulation of cretaceous fossils. The collector,\r\nhowever, should remember that the ossicula and plates of the receptacle\r\n(as for instance of the _Marsupites_), are but slightly adherent to\r\neach other, and the chalk must not be wholly removed, or these parts\r\nwill become detached.\r\n\r\nThe receptacles of the Apiocrinites of the chalk are rarely found\r\nwith more than a few joints of the column attached; and I believe no\r\nvestiges of the arms have been observed: these parts are therefore\r\ndesiderata, and should be diligently sought for: the radicles of these\r\ncrinoideans are long, articulated, and branching, and without due\r\ncaution may be mistaken for the arms, or for another species. The first\r\nremark will also apply to the Marsupite; any specimens with but a few\r\nossicula of the arms are very precious. I may observe that there is yet\r\nmuch to learn as to the number of species and genera, and the peculiar\r\ncharacters of the Crinoidea of the chalk, and that any addition to our\r\nknowledge on this subject will be valuable.\r\n\r\nThe _Asteridæ_ are so simple in form and structure, that it is\r\nunnecessary to offer any suggestions for their development; of course\r\nthey must not be removed from the stone.\r\n\r\nAmong the detached ossicula dispersed through the chalk, the student\r\nwill remember that the large _madrepore-like_ tubercle of the\r\nStar-fishes, (_ante_, p. 304,) may often occur. It may easily be\r\nmistaken for an encrinital body, or for a coral, but an accurate\r\ninspection will show that it is not composed of anchylosed plates, like\r\nthe receptacle of an Apiocrinite, but has surfaces for attachment to\r\nother ossicula; while the ends, which in a crinoideal column would have\r\nradiated surfaces, are rounded and entire.\r\n\r\nIn collecting Echinites, much caution is required in dissecting\r\nspecimens surrounded by spines. If imbedded in hard limestone, or in\r\nlaminated clay, it is scarcely possible to preserve the spines in\r\nconnexion with the shell; but it often happens that the Cidarites of\r\nthe Oolite are attached by the base to the solid limestone, and the\r\ncase with the spines is imbedded in sandy, friable aggregate, not\r\ndifficult of removal. A specimen in my cabinet, with upwards of fifty\r\nspines attached to the shell, was obtained under such circumstances.[304]\r\n\r\n[304] Now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk Echinites will be found to possess spines more frequently\r\nthan is commonly supposed, if care be taken to explore the surrounding\r\nchalk before it be removed. T have often procured Cidarites with\r\nspines, when there were no apparent vestiges of these appendages, by\r\ncarefully scraping away the surrounding mass until the extremity of a\r\nspine appeared, and then tracing it up to its connexion with the shell;\r\nanother point was discovered by further removal, and that was developed\r\nin the same manner; and at length a Cidaris with several spines was\r\nobtained. The chalk around the mouth should always be cautiously\r\nremoved in the dentated species, in the hope of preserving the teeth,\r\nas in the specimens, _Lign. 101, fig. 1_, and _Lign. 104, fig. 1_.\r\n\r\nAs the shells of Chalk Echinites, when hollow, are often lined with\r\ncrystals (see _Lign. 103, fig. 3_), it is worth while to break\r\nall indifferent specimens of the common species, with the chance of\r\nobtaining an example of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe chalk must not be _scraped off_ from the crust or shell of the\r\nEchinites, or the minute granulations and papillæ will be injured or\r\nremoved; it should be flaked off with a blunt point.\r\n\r\nIn friable arenaceous strata, as in some of the Maestricht and Tertiary\r\ndeposits, the Echinites may be extricated in as perfect a condition\r\nas if fresh from the sea; it is, indeed, probable, from the habit of\r\nthese animals of burrowing in mud and sand, that in many instances they\r\nwere entombed alive by the sediment in which their fossil remains are\r\nimbedded.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Cidarites and their spines may be collected in the Oolitic\r\nstrata at Calne, Chippenham, Bath, &c.; and in the coralline Oolite\r\nnear Faringdon; and of Saleniæ, in the Greensand gravel-pits near that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Greensand near Warminster, and at Chute Farm, near\r\nHeytesbury, abounds in small Cidaritidæ and other echinites. The large\r\nsinuated Clypeus is found in great perfection in the Oolite at Malton,\r\nCheltenham, Gloucester, &c.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous echinites are to be met with in most localities of\r\nthe white chalk. The chalk-pits in Kent, especially at Gravesend,\r\nNorthfleet, Chatham, &c. are rich in Cidarites, and their spines.\r\nThe Galerites, and Ananchytes, are also very fine and numerous; and\r\nthe softness of the chalk renders their extrication from the stone a\r\ndelightful task for the young geologist.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the common kinds of fossil Echinoderms may be obtained at\r\nmoderate prices of the dealers named in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThere is a matchless suite of fossil Echinidæ in the British Museum,\r\nwhich has been arranged and named by Mr. S. P. Woodward, and is now\r\nthe most instructive and interesting collection extant. It contains\r\nexamples of the following genera, viz., Ananchytes, Echinocorys,\r\nEchinolampas, Holaster, Galerites, Cidaris, Diadema, Acrosalenia,\r\nGlypticus, Disaster, Pygurus, Clypeaster, Scutella, Salmasis,\r\nEchinocyanus, &c. There is also a good series of echinital spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FORAMINIFERA--MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF CHALK AND FLINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Where is the dust that has not been alive?\"\r\n\r\n Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat those infinitesimal forms of animal existence which swarm\r\nthroughout the waters of the ocean, but whose presence can only be\r\nmade manifest by the aid of the microscope, are preserved in a fossil\r\nstate,--that their durable remains constitute mountain ranges, and\r\nform the subsoil of extensive regions,--and that the most stupendous\r\nmonuments erected by man are constructed of the petrified relics of\r\nbeings invisible to the unassisted eye,--are facts not the least\r\nastounding of those which modern Geology has revealed.\r\n\r\nThis interesting field of research, which the labours of that eminent\r\nobserver M. Ehrenberg first made known, has since been explored\r\nby other naturalists, and in every part of the world many of the\r\nTertiary and Secondary deposits have been found to contain microscopic\r\norganisms in profusion. At present this branch of palæontology is in\r\nits infancy, and it offers to the young student an inexhaustible and\r\nmost attractive path of scientific investigation; it possesses, too,\r\nthis great advantage over many others, that it can be pursued at home,\r\nand the materials for its prosecution are everywhere at hand. Unlike\r\nmy explorations in the Wealden, in which a few fragments of bones, or\r\nteeth, scattered at wide intervals through the rocks, and in localities\r\nmany miles apart, were often the only reward of a day's labour, here,\r\nin the quiet of my study, I may discover in a few atoms of flint,\r\nor grains of chalk, picked up by the road-side, the fossil remains\r\nof beings as interesting and extraordinary as the extinct colossal\r\nreptiles of Tilgate Forest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICROPHYTES.]\r\n\r\nThe microphytes, or fossil Diatomaceæ, described in a previous chapter,\r\n(_ante_, p. 93,) were formerly classed with the organisms that now\r\nclaim our attention, under the name _Infusoria_; from the belief that\r\ngenerally prevailed among naturalists, of their animal origin. In fact,\r\nsome eminent microscopic observers, while admitting the vegetable\r\ncharacter of Xanthidium, Micrasterias, &c. consider the Naviculæ,\r\nEnnotiæ, &c. as belonging to the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThus Dr. J, W. Bailey, in a late \"Memoir on the Microscopic Organisms\r\nin Various Localities of the United States,\" divides these bodies into\r\nthree groups; viz. _Infusoria_, _Desmidieæ_, and _Diatomaceæ_; with the\r\nremark, that he has separated the two latter tribes from the Infusoria,\r\nbecause so many distinguished naturalists consider them decidedly to\r\nbelong to the vegetable kingdom: \"but,\" he adds, \"while I believe that\r\nno positive line of separation can be drawn between certain animals and\r\nvegetables, I am yet disposed to regard the _Desmidieæ_, from the sum\r\nof all their characters, as most nearly allied to admitted vegetables;\r\nwhile the _Diatomaceæ_, notwithstanding Mr. Thwaites's interesting\r\nobservations on their conjunction,[305] still seem to me, as they have\r\nalways done, to be true animals. There is such apparent volition in\r\ntheir movements, such an abundance of nitrogen in the composition\r\nof their soft parts, and such resemblance between the stipitate\r\nGomphonematæ and some of the Vorticellæ, that I should be still\r\ndisposed to class them as animals, even if Ehrenberg's observations\r\nof the retractile threads and snail-like feet of some of the Naviculæ\r\nshould not be confirmed.\"[306]\r\n\r\n[305] The mode of fructification, or _conjunction_, as it is termed,\r\nin the Algæ, consists in the adhesion of two cells or frustules\r\ntogether, and their fusion into one; from their united contents a\r\nmass of granular substance is produced, that becomes consolidated and\r\nforms the spore or fruit, which, when arrived at maturity, is set free\r\nby the bursting of the cell. Mr. Thwaites has ascertained that the\r\nfructification is similar in the Diatomaceæ.\r\n\r\n[306] Smithsonian Contributions, vol. ii. p. 34.\r\n\r\nThus, whilst referring Closterium, Arthrodesma, Euastrum, Xanthidium,\r\nMicrasterium, &c. as vegetables, to the Desmidieæ, Dr. Bailey\r\nplaces, _Actinocyclus_, _Campilodiscus_, _Coscinodiscus_, _Ennotia_,\r\n_Navicula_, _Gomphonema_, _Pinnularia_, _Triceratium_, &c. among the\r\nDiatomaceæ, as animals.\r\n\r\nOf the animal nature of the microscopic objects which now require\r\nour attention, there is however no question, although the zoological\r\nposition and affinities of many of the organisms included in this\r\nsurvey are still but imperfectly determined.\r\n\r\nThe animals designated _Foraminifera_,[307] or Rhizopoda,[308] are of a\r\nmore simple structure than the Polypifera and Echinodermata described\r\nin the previous chapters; yet as their relics are for the most part\r\npresented to the notice of the geologist as aggregations of shells,\r\nforming extensive beds of limestone, it will be convenient to treat of\r\nthem in this place.\r\n\r\n[307] Foraminifera, _i.e._ bearing foramina--a name derived from the\r\nminute openings in the shells and their septa.\r\n\r\n[308] Rhizopoda; root-like feet; from the long fibrous processes, or\r\npseudopodia.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the fossil remains of Foraminifera, and of _Mollusca_,\r\nalike consist of shells, and constitute strata identical in mineral\r\ncharacters, and deposited under like physical conditions, renders the\r\nexamination of these Microzoa[309] a fit introduction to the study of\r\nthe durable remains of the higher order--the Mollusca.\r\n\r\n[309] Microzoa; from μικρος, _mikros_, small, and ζωον, _zoon_, animal;\r\na convenient term to denote minute animal organisms whose forms can\r\nonly be defined by the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely more than a hundred and twenty years ago, that the\r\nexistence of this numerous order of microzoa was first made known to\r\nnaturalists by _Beccarius_, who detected a considerable number of\r\nspecies in the sand on the shores of the Adriatic. But the structure of\r\nthe animals that secreted these shells is a discovery of comparatively\r\nmodern date. The early collectors classed these microscopic bodies with\r\nthe shells of true mollusca; and even M. D'Orbigny, whose elaborate\r\nresearches justly constitute him a high authority in this branch of\r\nnatural history, in his first memoir, in 1825, described the involuted\r\ndiscoidal forms as Cephalopoda. This error was corrected by the\r\ninvestigations of M. Dujardin, who in 1835 satisfactorily demonstrated\r\nthat the Foraminifera are animals of the most simple structure, and\r\nentirely separated by their organization from the Mollusca.\r\n\r\nBut the true nature of this class is so little understood by British\r\ncollectors of fossil shells,--of course I mean the uninitiated, and\r\nthe amateur naturalist, for whose use these unpretending pages are\r\ndesigned,--that in order to invest the study of the fossil species with\r\nthe interest which a knowledge of the structure and economy of the\r\nliving originals can alone impart, I must give a history of the recent\r\nforms somewhat in detail, taking M. D'Orbigny as my chief authority.[310]\r\n\r\n[310] The best work for the student to consult is M. D'Orbigny's\r\n\"Foraminifères Fossiles du Basse Tertiaire de Vienne, Autriche.\" Paris,\r\n1846. 1 vol. 4to. with plates. I rejoice to learn that a Monograph\r\non the British Foraminifera is in preparation by Dr. Carpenter and\r\nProfessor Williamson: than whom there are none more competent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\nThe Foraminifera are marine animals of low organization, and, with but\r\nfew exceptions, extremely minute: in an ounce of sea-sand between three\r\nand four millions have been distinctly enumerated. When living, they\r\nare not aggregated, but always individually distinct; they are composed\r\nof a body, or vital mass, of a gelatinous consistence, which is either\r\nentire and round, or divided into segments, placed either on a simple\r\nor alternate line, or coiled in a spiral, or involuted round an axis.\r\nThis body is covered with an envelope or shell, which is generally\r\ntestaceous, rarely cartilaginous, is modelled on the segments, and\r\nfollows all the modifications of form and contour of the body. From the\r\nextremity of the last segment there issue sometimes from one, sometimes\r\nfrom several openings of the shell, or through the numerous pores or\r\nforamina, very elongated, slender, contractile, colourless, filaments,\r\nmore or less divided and ramified, serving for prehension, and capable\r\nof entirely investing the shell.\r\n\r\nThe body varies in colour, but is always identical in individuals of\r\nthe same species; it is yellow, ochreous, red, violet, blue, &c.\r\n\r\nIts consistence is variable; it is composed of minute globules, the\r\naggregation of which determines the general tint. It is sometimes\r\nentire, round, and without segments, as in _Gromia_, _Orbulina_,\r\n&c., which represent at all ages the embryonic state of all the\r\nother genera. The animal increases by gemmation, each segment being\r\nessentially distinct, but connected with the preceding one by a tube or\r\nneck. When the body is divided by lobes or segments, the primary lobe,\r\nas in the permanent condition of the Gromia, is at first round or oval,\r\naccording to the genus; once formed it never enlarges, but is enveloped\r\nexternally by testaceous matter.\r\n\r\nThe segments, which successively appear, are agglomerated together\r\nin seven different ways, and these modifications are the basis of M.\r\nD'Orbigny's classification. The discoidal forms, as the _Rotalia_,\r\n_Rosalina_, _Cristellaria_, &c. are involute, like the Nautilus, and\r\ndivided by septa or partitions, which, like the enveloping shell, are\r\nperforated. The lobes of the body _occupy contemporaneously every\r\nchamber_, and are connected by a tube that extends through the entire\r\nseries. In the spiral form, as the Textularia, &c., the same structure\r\nis apparent.\r\n\r\nWhatever the form of the body, the filaments always consist of a\r\ncolourless transparent matter; they are capable of being elongated to\r\nsix times the diameter of the shell. They often divide and subdivide,\r\nso as to appear branched; and though alike in form in the different\r\ngenera, vary much in their position. In some species they form a bundle\r\nwhich issues from a single aperture, and is withdrawn into the same by\r\ncontraction; in others, the filaments project only through each of the\r\npores in that portion of the shell which covers the last segment: in\r\nmany they issue from both the large aperture and the foramina. These\r\nfilaments or pseudopodia fulfil in these animals the functions of\r\nthe numerous tentacula in the Star-fishes; serving as instruments of\r\nlocomotion and attachment.\r\n\r\nNeither organs of nutriment nor of reproduction have been discovered.\r\nIn the genera having one large aperture from which the filaments\r\nissue and retract, we can conceive nutriment to be absorbed by that\r\nopening; but this cannot be the case in the species which have the last\r\ncell closed up; in these the filaments issuing through the foramina\r\nare probably also organs of nutrition. M. D'Orbigny considers the\r\nForaminifera as constituting a distinct class in zoology; though less\r\ncomplicated than the Echinoderms and the Polypifera in their internal\r\norganization, they have the mode of locomotion of the first; while by\r\ntheir free, individual existence, they are more advanced in the scale\r\nof being than the aggregated and immovably fixed animals of the latter\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nBut though I consider the animal of the Foraminifera as single, and\r\nthe additional lobes, or segments, as the continuous growth of the\r\nsame individual, I must state that some eminent naturalists regard\r\nthe entire structure as a series of distinct individuals, developed\r\nby gemmation from the first formed segment, like the clusters of\r\nthe compound _Tunicata_; and not as a single aggregated organism,\r\nmade up of an assemblage of similar parts indefinitely repeated. In\r\na palæontological point of view, it matters not which opinion is\r\nadopted.[311]\r\n\r\n[311] See a masterly paper on the structure of Nummulina and Orbitoides,\r\nby Dr. Carpenter; Geol. Journal, vol. vi. pp. 21-39, with admirable\r\nrepresentations of the structural details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 109. Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n_Chalk.

D'Orbigny, and give a few illustrations\r\nof some of the most abundant fossil species.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may be cognizant of the usual aspect of these shells\r\nfive specimens from the Chalk, belonging to as many genera, are here\r\nrepresented (_Lign. 109_); the deposit whence they were obtained will\r\nbe described hereafter.\r\n\r\nAs the mode in which the growth of the body, and consequently of the\r\nshell, takes place, differs greatly in certain groups, an obvious and\r\nnatural arrangement is suggested, by which the class is divided into\r\nseven orders:--\r\n\r\n1. The primary, or simplest type; one segment or cell; as in _Orbulina_.\r\n\r\n2. The segments arranged in circular lines; as in _Orbitolina_.\r\n\r\n3. Segments disposed in a straight or arched single line; successively\r\nincreasing from the first to the last cell; as in _Nodosaria_, _Lign.\r\n111_.\r\n\r\n4. Segments, spirally and discoidally disposed, on the same plane, like\r\ncells of the Nautilus; as in _Cristellaria_, _Lign. 109_.\r\n\r\nThe same type, but coiled obliquely, and inequilaterally, like the\r\nshells of Gasteropoda; as in _Globigerina_, _Lign. 109_, _Rosalina_,\r\n_Lign. 109_.\r\n\r\n5. Segments developed alternately on the right and left of the\r\nfirst, and successively on each side the longitudinal axis; as in\r\n_Textularia_, _Lign. 109_.\r\n\r\n6. Arrangement of the segments combining the modes of 4 and 5; that is,\r\nthe segments are formed alternately, but the whole are coiled spirally,\r\neither obliquely, or on the same plane; as in _Amphistigena_.\r\n\r\n7. Segments round a common axis, on two, three, four, or five, opposite\r\nfaces, returning after each entire revolution; the new cells being\r\nplaced exactly on the preceding series; as in _Quinqueloculina_, _Pict.\r\nAtlas_, pl. lxii. _fig._ 12.\r\n\r\nThe Foraminifera vary considerably in magnitude; by far the greater\r\nnumber of species are invisible to the unassisted eye, and the aid\r\nof a lens or microscope is required to define the structure even of\r\nthe largest; yet many are of sufficient size to be recognized, as for\r\nexample the _Spirolinæ_, _Lign. 112_. A few genera are from a quarter\r\nof an inch to nearly an inch in diameter, as the _Orbitoides Mantelli_\r\nof the tertiary formations of North America,[312] and the _Nummulina_,\r\ncommonly termed _Nummulites_, of Europe, _Lign. 110_.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe the genera selected for illustration,\r\ncommencing with the large and well-known type, whose aggregated\r\nremains form extensive beds of crystalline limestone in the Alps,\r\nand in Asia, and Africa.[313]\r\n\r\n[312] Dr. Morton's Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the Cretaceous\r\ngroup of the United States.

They occur in immense quantities in certain rocks, and\r\nare of all sizes, from a mere point, to disks an inch and a half in\r\ndiameter; thus exceeding in magnitude all other animals of this class.\r\n\r\nPerfect specimens appear as a calcareous solid circular body, of a\r\nlenticular shape; smooth, and slightly convex on both sides, and\r\nwithout any visible structure. On splitting the fossil transversely,\r\nor rubbing down one of the convex planes, a series of minute cells,\r\narranged in a discoidal spire, is brought to view, as shown in _Lign.\r\n110, fig. 1_. But this description gives a very inadequate idea of the\r\ncomplicated and exquisite structure of the original, which has been\r\nadmirably worked out by Dr. Carpenter. This eminent physiologist has\r\nshown that each chamber was occupied by a living segment, connected\r\nwith other segments by one or more tubular prolongations, which\r\nabsorbed nutrition from without, by means of filamentous pseudopodia,\r\nthat projected through a system of passages leading from the medial\r\nplane to the external surface.[314] A figure of the supposed form of a\r\nliving Nummulina is given in Pict. Atlas, p. 187.\r\n\r\n[314] Geol. Journal, vol. vi. p. 21.

Strabo alludes to the\r\nNummulites of the Pyramids, as lentils which had been scattered about\r\nby the artificers employed on those stupendous monuments, and become\r\nstone.[315] Silicified masses of Nummulites are occasionally met with;\r\npolished slices of such specimens are richly figured by the sections of\r\nthe inclosed Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n[315] An interesting fact was communicated to me by a friend who\r\nlately descended the Nile; the Nummulitic limestone rocks are in some\r\nparts of the course of the river washed into the stream, and becoming\r\ndisintegrated, the Nummulites are set free, and re-deposited in the\r\nrecent mud of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Nummulitic limestones are of the Eocene or ancient. Tertiary epoch,\r\nas the labours of Sir Roderick Murchison in the Alps, Apennines, and\r\nCarpathians first established: Nummulites are unknown in the Secondary\r\nformations.[316]\r\n\r\n[316] Geol.

Mantelli_, in his work on the\r\nCretaceous Fossils of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the Nummulitic deposits of the Old World were of\r\nthe tertiary period, directed attention to their supposed geological\r\nequivalents in America; and on a careful examination of their fossils,\r\nthe rocks proved to be tertiary, and the shells true Foraminifera\r\nallied to the Nummulites, but generically distinct.[317] A reference to\r\nDr. Carpenters memoir, previously cited, is necessary to comprehend the\r\ncomplicated structure of these fossils.[318]\r\n\r\n[317] Manual of Geology, p. 208.\r\n\r\n[318] Geol.

These fossils abound in\r\nthe cretaceous strata of Maestricht.\r\n\r\nFusulina.--The shell is fusiform, being elongated transversely to\r\nthe axis; the cells are divided internally by constrictions.

Four species were named\r\nby Lord Northampton (see _Wond._ p. 32-5); but it is doubtful whether\r\nall the specimens belong to more than one species; the apparent\r\ndiversity of structure may arise simply from the different planes in\r\nwhich the sections happen to have been made.\r\n\r\nGlobigerina. _Lign. 109, fig. 1._--The shell is turbinated, the cells\r\nare spheroidal, and the last, or terminal one, has a semilunar aperture\r\nat the umbilical angle.

Upwards of thirty fossil species are known.\r\nThe Textulariæ are in great abundance in the cretaceous rocks; and,\r\ntogether with Rotaliæ and Rosalinæ, constitute a large proportion of\r\nthe minute organisms of the secondary formations as well as of the\r\npresent seas.\r\n\r\nVerneuilina.--_Lign. 109, fig. 3._--A turriculated shell, with a slit\r\nor aperture transverse to the axis of involution, and placed on the\r\numbilicus.

We will commence the investigation with that common\r\nsubstance, the white chalk of the South-East of England.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that a large proportion of the purest white\r\nchalk consists of minute chambered shells,[322] and corals.\r\n\r\n[322] Often termed _Polythalamia_, meaning many chambers or cells.\r\n\r\nMr. Lonsdale, some years since, first showed that by brushing chalk in\r\nwater, and examining the sediment, shells, corals, and foraminifera\r\nmight be obtained in abundance; but it was not at that time suspected\r\nthat the residue of the detritus was almost entirely composed of\r\ndistinct organic structures, so minute as to require high magnifying\r\npowers, and a peculiar mode of manipulation, for their detection and\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nM. Ehrenberg demonstrated that even the fossils discovered by Mr.\r\nLonsdale are colossal, in comparison with the infinitesimal structures\r\nof which the finer particles of the chalk consist; for one cubic\r\ninch of the limestone is found to contain upwards of a million of\r\nwell-preserved animal organisms.\r\n\r\nThe chalk, therefore, is an aggregation of extremely minute fossils\r\nand inorganic particles. The yellow, soft, writing chalk of the North\r\nof Europe, according to M. Ehrenberg, is composed of about half its\r\nmass of organic remains; but in the chalk of the South of Europe, the\r\nfossils predominate. The amorphous atoms of the cretaceous limestone\r\ndo not, as was formerly believed, arise from a precipitate of lime\r\npreviously held in solution, but from the disintegration of the\r\nassembled organisms into more minute calcareous particles; and these\r\nhave subsequently been reunited by a crystalline action, into regular,\r\nelliptical, granular, bodies.\r\n\r\nM. Ehrenberg infers that the compact flint nodules have originated from\r\nan aggregation of pulverulent particles of siliceous organisms; and\r\nupon this hypothesis explains the absence of flint nodules, and the\r\nabundance of siliceous infusoria, in the beds of marl that alternate\r\nwith the chalk in the south of Europe, and their presence in the chalk\r\nof northern Europe, in which the marls are wanting. In other words,\r\nhe supposes, that in the former case the siliceous shells of the\r\nanimalcules were spread abroad and deposited in layers or strata; and\r\nin the latter were aggregated into nodular masses. This opinion is not,\r\nhowever, supported by facts; for, though the animal origin of lime,\r\nflint, and iron, may be admitted to a great extent, yet the deposition\r\nof silex and lime from aqueous solutions, is carried on at the present\r\nmoment upon an enormous scale; and it cannot be doubted that to such a\r\nprocess is attributable the formation of the nodules, layers, dikes,\r\nand veins of flint, which traverse the chalk, and other rocks.[323]\r\n\r\n[323] See my \"Memoir on a Microscopical Examination of Chalk and Flint,\"\r\nAnnals of Nat. Hist., Aug. 1845.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant microscopic organisms in the English chalk and flint\r\nwhich I have examined, are _Rotaliæ_, or _Rosalinæ_, and _Textulariæ_.\r\nImmense numbers of minuter Foraminifera also occur, and many shells,\r\nwhich are unquestionably the young state of testaceous Cephalopoda (as\r\n_Nautilus_, _Ammonite_, &c.).\r\n\r\nSpines of Sponges, and of Echinoderms, also frequently appear in the\r\nfield of the microscope: and a spongeous structure is so common in\r\nflint, that an eminent observer conceives that all the flints, both\r\nnodular and tabular, have originated from poriferous zoophytes;[324] an\r\nhypothesis altogether inadmissible.\r\n\r\n[324] \"Memoir on the Siliceous Bodies in the Chalk, Greensands, and\r\nOolite,\" by J. S. Bowerbank, Esq. F.R.S. &c. Geol. Trans, vol. vi. p.\r\n181.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that the chalk every where consists almost wholly of\r\norganic bodies must likewise be accepted with some limitation. The\r\nassiduous observer who searches for hours chalk and flint carefully\r\nprepared, and with the aid of an excellent microscope, though he\r\nwill meet with immense numbers of organisms, will often find a great\r\nproportion of atoms without traces of structure. Neither is there\r\nmuch variety in the easily recognizable forms of the English chalk (I\r\nwrite from my own limited experience); many of the species described\r\nby M. Ehrenberg, and others, are few and far between; and I have not\r\ndetected a single example of diatomaceæ. The student therefore must\r\nnot be discouraged, if, after perusing the glowing accounts of the\r\ndiscoveries of M. Ehrenberg, he should not be more successful than\r\nmyself. It must, however, be borne in mind, that as the fossil remains\r\nof the larger animals and plants are commonly associated together\r\nin particular localities, while in similar rocks in other districts\r\nthey are altogether wanting; in like manner, some strata of the same\r\nseries may be made up of organic bodies, while others are destitute of\r\nthem. In fact, such is the case with our English Chalk: some layers in\r\nthe cliffs at Dover are literally an aggregation of foraminifera and\r\ncorals, while other beds have but few vestiges of organic remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHALK FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 115.

If some of the powder be immersed in Canada balsam, (as\r\ndirected in the instructions at the close of this chapter for preparing\r\nchalk for microscopical examination,) the outline of the shells, and\r\nthe cavities of, the cells, will be apparent; as in the sketches\r\n_Lign. 114_, _ante_ p. 351. If a chip or slice of flint, rendered\r\ntransparent by immersion in oil of turpentine or Canada balsam, be\r\nviewed first with a low power, (1 inch object-glass,) to discover a\r\ngood specimen, and afterwards under a high magnifier, (a 1/4 or an\r\n1/8 object-glass,) the form of the shell and of the cells will be\r\ndistinctly seen, as in _Lign. 116_. In this beautiful fossil Rotalia,\r\nthe segments are as sharply defined as in a recent example: and one of\r\nthe cells (_a_) is seen to be lined with quartz crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 116. Section of a Rotalia in flint.\r\n\r\n(_Seen by transmitted light, and showing the chambers partially filled\r\nwith mineral matter._)\r\n\r\n_a._ A cell lined with spar.\r\n\r\n(× 250 _diameters_.)]\r\n\r\nAt first sight this fossil might be mistaken for a nautilus partially\r\nfilled with spar; but the reader will remark that the septa, or\r\npartitions, have their convex surface towards the aperture; whereas\r\nin the shells of the Cephalopoda (Nautilus, Ammonite, &c.) the septa\r\nare concave anteriorly. In _Lign. 114_, _fig._ 4, a series of casts in\r\nflint of the septa of a young Nautilus is represented; by comparing it\r\nwith the Rotaliæ in the same lignograph, _figs._ 2, 3, this distinction\r\nwill be obvious. And here it may be necessary again to point out the\r\nessential character of the animal of the foraminifera, as distinguished\r\nfrom that of the cephalopoda with chambered shells. In the latter,\r\nthe body of the mollusk only occupies the large outer chamber; the\r\ninternal compartments are empty dwellings, which the animal has\r\nsuccessively quitted in the progress of its growth, and with which\r\nit has no connexion except by the siphunculus. In the Rotalia, and\r\nallied forms, the body of the animal is inclosed within the shells, and\r\noccupies every chamber contemporaneously at every stage: the cells are\r\nalways filled by the segments of the body. Hence when the shell, which\r\nis calcareous, is dissolved in weak hydrochloric acid, the soft body\r\nis exposed, and seen to extend to the innermost chamber. The segments\r\nare connected by a membranous tube, which some naturalists regard as\r\na common channel of communication between the several digestive sacs\r\nof which the body consists; for minute diatomaceæ which the animal has\r\nswallowed, (according to Ehrenberg,) are seen within the membranous\r\nsacs; as shown in _Lign. 113_, which represents the body of a\r\nNonionina, deprived of its shell. The importance of obtaining a correct\r\nidea of this structure will presently appear.\r\n\r\nWhen a recent Rotalia is immersed in dilute acid, the soft parts of\r\nthe body, deprived of the shell, may be obtained entire; they consist\r\nof a series of little bags or sacs, united by a tube. The constituent\r\nsubstance appears to be a tough membrane, and is generally of a rich\r\nbrown or amber colour. The sacs are sometimes full of a granular\r\nsubstance, but are often empty and collapsed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BODIES OF ROTALIÆ.]\r\n\r\nFossil remains of the soft parts of Foraminifera. _Lign. 113._--When\r\nexamining chalk[325] and flint under the microscope with the view of\r\ndiscovering the fossil bodies described by M. Ehrenberg, I observed\r\nthat the cells of the Rotaliæ in flint were frequently occupied by a\r\nsubstance varying in colour from a light amber to a dark brown, and\r\nclosely resembling in appearance the body of the recent foraminifer\r\ndeprived of its shell. Under a high power, the folds of the membranous\r\nsacs and the connecting tube were apparent, and I felt convinced that\r\nthe substance filling the cells was not inorganic, but the original\r\nanimal tissues in the state of molluskite.[326] In short, that the\r\nanimal had become immersed and preserved in the fluid silex like the\r\ninsects in amber. The appearance of the first discovered example of\r\nthis kind is represented in _Lign. 117_.\r\n\r\n[325] In 1845.\r\n\r\n[326] _Molluskite_: a name by which I proposed to distinguish the\r\ncarbonaceous substance resulting from the soft bodies of testaceous\r\nmollusca.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 117. Rotalia in Flint, with the fossilized body of\r\nthe animal in the shell: _highly magnified_.\r\n\r\n(_Seen by transmitted light._)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOFT BODIES OF FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\nIn a paper read before the Geological Society in 1845,[327] I\r\nventured to affirm the animal nature of the fossils in question; but\r\nthe supposition was regarded by geologists as very startling and\r\nunsatisfactory; and as the specimens were enveloped in flint, the\r\nappearance was attributed to the infiltration of mineral matter of a\r\ndifferent colour from the surrounding silex, into the empty chambers;\r\na circumstance of frequent occurrence in Ammonites, Nautili, and even\r\nin the foraminifera; for the latter are often filled with chalk, flint,\r\nsilicate of iron, crystal, &c. as in _Lign. 116_. In these instances,\r\nI conceive the shells were either empty when immersed in the fluid\r\nchalk or flint, or speedily became so by the decomposition of the soft\r\nparts of the animal. But in the fossils under consideration, I believe\r\nthe live animal was suddenly enveloped, and hermetically sealed, as\r\nit were, in its shell, and that putrefaction was thus prevented.\r\nThe uniformity in colour, and the structure of the substance in the\r\ncells, appeared to me incompatible with its assumed mineral origin,\r\nand I resolved to follow up the inquiry by an examination of Rotaliæ\r\nin chalk; in the hope that by dissolving the shell in acid (as in\r\nrecent foraminifera), the body of the animal might be detected in an\r\nunmineralized state. After many fruitless attempts, several examples of\r\nthe soft bodies of Rotaliæ were obtained from the grey chalk of Dover,\r\nin an extraordinary state of preservation.[328]\r\n\r\n[327] Notes of a Microscopical Examination of the Chalk and Flint of the\r\nSouth-East of England, with Remarks on the Animalculites of certain\r\nTertiary and Modern Deposits.

See Philos.\r\nTransactions, 1846, p. 465.\r\n\r\nIn these fossils the sacs are generally more or less distended with\r\na dark substance, as in _Lign. 118, fig. 2_: but in some, they are\r\nempty and collapsed in folds, just as membranous pouches would appear\r\nunder similar conditions; as in the exquisite fossil, _Lign. 118,\r\nfig. 1_.\r\n\r\nThe sacs regularly diminish in size from the innermost to the outermost\r\ncell, and vary in number from fourteen to twenty-six; being more\r\nnumerous than in the recent species of Rotaliæ that have come under my\r\nnotice. In some instances small papillæ are seen on the outer surface\r\nof the integument; apparently the vestiges of the pseudopodia.[330]\r\n\r\n[330] Admirably as my excellent engraver, Mr. Lee, (of Prince's Square,\r\nKennington,) has executed the lignograph, 118, I would refer the reader\r\nto the steel plate in Philos. Trans. 1846, pl. xxi. for figures of\r\nthese marvellous fossils.\r\n\r\nNot only is the form and general character of the animal substance\r\npreserved, but even its flexibility; for in one instance, the body,\r\nreleased by the solution of the chalk and shell, was uncoiled and\r\npressed out, as shown in _Lign. 119, fig. 4_.\r\n\r\nIn one specimen, (figured in _Philos. Trans._ 1846, pl. xxi. _fig._\r\n10,) the membrane of the largest sacs is much corrugated, and disposed\r\nin numerous duplications, probably owing to the empty state of these\r\nsegments, when immersed in the chalk; but the discoidal contour of\r\nthe original is well preserved. This fossil so closely resembles the\r\ndecalcified body of a recent Rotalia or Rosalina, that an eminent\r\nobserver who saw it under the microscope at the meeting of the Royal\r\nSociety, without knowing its history, concluded it to be the body\r\nof a recent animal. This extraordinary preservation of the soft\r\ndelicate tissues of an animal of the cretaceous seas, invisible to the\r\nunassisted eye, through the incalculable ages that must have elapsed\r\nsince the deposition of the chalk in which it was enshrined, is a fact\r\nas remarkable as the occurrence of the carcass of the Lena Mammoth, in\r\nthe frozen soil of Siberia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORAMINIFERA IN CHALK AND FLINT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 119.

Dr. Bailey, of West Point\r\nMilitary Academy, soon after the publication of my first paper, sent me\r\nspecimens from the marls of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nForaminiferous Limestones of India.--So much doubt was expressed as to\r\nthe accuracy of my opinion respecting the nature of the fossil Rotaliæ,\r\nthat its corroboration by observations on certain limestones in India,\r\nby H. J. Carter, Esq. Secretary of the Bombay Royal Asiatic Society,\r\nwas as gratifying as unexpected. According to the researches of that\r\ngentleman, the south-east coast of Arabia is chiefly composed of two\r\ndistinct limestone formations; the one averaging about 4,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and the other 600 feet. The latter forms the\r\ndesert of Akaf, and with the intervention of the mountains of Oman,\r\nwhich belong to the greater formation, passes up into the lower Sindh;\r\nwhile the former constitutes the high land of the coast, which, parting\r\nfrom the western border of the Desert of Akaf, extends nearly to Cape\r\nAden.\r\n\r\nThe limestones of both these groups, or formations, consist chiefly of\r\nforaminifera; the largest forms being visible to the naked eye. Mr.\r\nCarter states that his attention was first directed to the organic\r\ncomposition of the Porebunder limestone, which is imported into Bombay\r\nfor building, by small amber-coloured specks on the stone, that\r\nresembled the soft parts of foraminifera figured and described by me\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions. \"On subjecting a portion of the\r\nlimestone to the action of acid, I found them to be what Dr. Mantell's\r\nobservations had led me to expect, the actual remains of the animals,\r\nof exquisite beauty in form and symmetrical development. The minute\r\nkinds in the Porebunder stone do not average more than 1/900 of an inch\r\nin diameter; and the composite forms are held together by thread-like\r\nattachments, which indicate the tubular communications that existed\r\nbetween them when living.\"[331]\r\n\r\n[331] \"On the Existence of Beds of Foraminifera, Recent and Fossil, on\r\nthe South-East coast of Arabia,\" by H.

F.G.S. who some years since made known the existence of\r\na remarkable deposit of chalk detritus, about one foot in thickness,\r\nwhich extends over the outcrop or exposed surface of the firestone in\r\nthat locality.\r\n\r\nThis bed consists of a soft, whitish, tenacious clay, which, when\r\nimmersed in water, is found to be largely composed of minute grains,\r\nthat prove to be foraminifera. These shells belong to many species\r\nand genera; and are associated with the cases of entomostraceous\r\ncrustaceans, spicula of sponges, &c. The organisms readily separate\r\nfrom the amorphous particles by washing, and specimens may be easily\r\nobtained as distinct and perfect as if recent. See _Lign. 109_, _ante_,\r\np. 342. Intermingled with the cretaceous forms, are minute fresh-water\r\nshells, apparently derived from a modern source.\r\n\r\nThe Charing deposit appears to have originated from the action of water\r\non the unconsolidated chalk of the neighbouring Downs, before the\r\nsurface of the hills was protected by a covering of vegetable soil.\r\n\r\nThrough the liberality of Mr. Harris, I have been able to examine an\r\nextensive series of the Charing Foraminifera; and Prof Williamson has\r\nfigured and described the principal types in an interesting memoir in\r\nthe Transactions of the Manchester Philos. Soc. vol. viii. 1847. As in\r\nmost of the cretaceous strata, the prevailing species are referable to\r\nthe genera Textularia, Rotalia, Rosalina, Cristellaria, Lagena,[332]\r\n&c. There are numerous spicula of sponges, and needle-like calcareous\r\nprisms, which are the detritus of the fibrous shells, called Inoceramus.\r\n\r\n[332] This interesting type of Foraminifera is the subject of a Memoir\r\nby Prof. Williamson; Annals, Nat. Hist. 1848, vol. i.\r\n\r\nForaminifera of the Oolite, Lias, &c.--The occurrence of certain genera\r\nin particular rocks has been incidentally noticed in the previous\r\ndescriptions, and it is needless to particularize any localities of\r\nthe Oolite, Lias, and other secondary deposits. It must suffice to\r\nstate that Dr. Carpenter, Prof Williamson, Prof Phillips, Mr. Sorby,\r\nMr. Rupert Jones, and other able observers, have figured and described\r\nforaminifera from the strata between the Chalk and the Carboniferous\r\nformations: the report to be drawn up by the two first-named gentlemen\r\nfor the British Association, will present a resume of the British\r\nfossil genera and species.\r\n\r\nIt is deserving record, that no vestiges of foraminifera have been\r\nfound in the Wealden strata; the fluviatile origin of those deposits\r\nrenders it improbable that the remains of these marine organisms should\r\noccur in great numbers, yet from, the estuary character of some of the\r\nbeds, the presence of foraminifera might be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nForaminiferous Deposits of the United States.--Dr. Bailey has made us\r\nfamiliar with the foraminiferous rocks of North America. The various\r\nmemoirs on this class of fossil animalculites, and on the diatomaceæ\r\n(_ante_, p. 93), published in the American Journal of Science, and in\r\nthe Smithsonian Transactions, attest the acumen, and unwearied spirit\r\nof research, of this able observer. Not only from the United States,\r\nbut from numerous localities in Asia and Arabia, Dr. Bailey has\r\ntransmitted me specimens of limestones containing foraminifera, chiefly\r\nof the genera Rotalia and Textularia.[333]\r\n\r\n[333] From Beyrout, Damascus, the Mount of Olives, Anti-Libanus.\r\n\r\nIn the calcareous marls of the Upper Missouri river, extending nearly\r\nto the Rocky Mountains, similar fossils are met with.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Florida, the white orbitoidal limestone is traversed\r\nby flint; and the calcareous and siliceous masses are full of\r\nmicroscopic foraminifera.[334]\r\n\r\n[334] Smithsonian Contributions, vol. ii. p. 161.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORAMINIFERA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS FORMATIONS.]\r\n\r\nForaminifera of the Carboniferous Formations.--In the carboniferous\r\nlimestones of England, the late Mr. Bowman, Prof. Tennant, and Mr.\r\nDarker, detected shells of foraminifera, apparently of the genus\r\nFusulina.[335] Prof. Phillips mentions the occurrence of nautiloid\r\nforaminifera in the palæozoic limestones of Carrington Park, South\r\nDevon, and Yorkshire.[336]\r\n\r\n[335] Edinburgh New Phil.

Bands of limestone, through a vertical extent of two\r\nhundred feet, are loaded with Fusulinæ; layers from five inches to five\r\nfeet in thickness, consist of a pure white Fusulina limestone; the\r\nforaminifera are all of one species, the _Fusulina cylindrica_.\r\n\r\n[338] Geology of Russia in Europe, vol. i. p. 86. pl. i. fig. 1.\r\n\r\nForaminiferous Limestone of New Zealand.--\"On the eastern coast of\r\nthe Middle Island of New Zealand, to the north of Otago, strata\r\nof yellow and fawn-coloured limestone appear on the surface at\r\nOtotara, and continue to Kakaunui.

A microscopical examination\r\nshows it to be in a great part composed of an aggregation of very small\r\npolythalamia.\"[339] The specimens of the Ototara limestone received from\r\nmy son, are very rich in minute corals and shells, and foraminifera\r\nof the European cretaceous type: species of Rotalia, Cristellaria,\r\nGlobigerina, Textularia, Rosalina, Nodosaria, Dentalina, &c. Among them\r\nare two forms which occur at Charing: namely, _Rosalina Lorneiana_,\r\n_Lign. 109, fig. 5_, and Textularia elongata: of the latter a\r\nspecimen in flint is figured, _Lign. 119, fig. 3_.

Journal, vol. vi. p. 339. pl. xxix.\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of fossil remains in the Ototara rock has decidedly a\r\ncretaceous aspect, but till the geological position of the strata in\r\nrelation to the other formations of the Island is determined, it would\r\nbe premature to regard these limestones as the equivalents in time of\r\nthe Chalk formations of Europe.[341]\r\n\r\n[341] A list of the Ototaran fossils collected by Mr. Walter Mantell, is\r\ngiven in Geol. Journal, vol. vi. p. 329.\r\n\r\nTertiary Foraminifera.--The marine tertiary deposits which contain\r\nforaminifera in abundance, are so numerous, that it is unnecessary to\r\nparticularize any. The sands of the Paris basin in some localities are\r\nso full of microscopic forms, that a cubic inch of the mass contains\r\nsixty thousand. The friable calcareous strata at Grignon are a loose\r\naggregate of the shells of foraminifera and minute mollusks; and as the\r\nfossil shells from that locality are very common, and generally filled\r\nwith debris, the student will have no difficulty in obtaining specimens\r\nfor examination. The tertiary argillaceous deposits of England are less\r\nrich in foraminifera than the arenaceous; but the usual types occur in\r\nthe London Clay, at Highgate, Clapham Common, Bracklesham Bay, &c. The\r\nEocene marls of the United States are rich in foraminifera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORAMINIFERA OF THE FENS.]\r\n\r\nForaminifera of the Fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.--Though\r\nthe alluvial deposits of the fen-districts are comparatively of modern\r\ndate, yet the rich assemblage of foraminifera contained in the clay\r\nof certain districts is so interesting and instructive, that a brief\r\nnotice of them must not be omitted. The foraminiferous character of\r\nthe Lincolnshire alluvium was first made known to me by specimens from\r\nBolton, sent me by Professor Williamson; and their extension over\r\na wide area in Cambridgeshire, by a liberal supply from Mr. Smith,\r\nof March. The bed that abounds in these shells, is about seven feet\r\nbeneath the surface, and consists of a fine sea sand combined with\r\ncarbonaceous and argillaceous matter. By washing about a gallon of this\r\nearth in water, an ounce of polythalamia and organic detritus may be\r\nobtained. The perfect shells are as fresh as if just dredged up from\r\nthe sea; the soft parts--the membranous segments held together by their\r\ntubular connexion--in many instances remaining in the shell; these\r\nparts may be obtained by the solution of the shell in acid. When the\r\nRotaliæ are rendered transparent by immersion in Canada balsam, their\r\nappearance, by transmitted light is identical with that exhibited by\r\nthe fossil specimens; and if viewed by reflected light, the body may\r\nbe seen occupying all the cells of the shell; but the segments are\r\nsomewhat collapsed; evidently from the shrinking of the animal tissues\r\nafter death.[342]\r\n\r\n[342] Two specimens are figured in my notice of fossil Foraminifera.\r\nPhil. Trans, p. iv. for 1846, pl. xxi. figs. 13, 14.\r\n\r\nThe organisms of the Lincolnshire alluvium have been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated by Prof. Williamson; they comprise many species and\r\ngenera, of the usual types; as Rotaliæ, Rosalinæ, Polystomellæ,\r\nTextulariæ, Lagenæ, Nodosariæ, &c. It is remarkable, that though a\r\nmarine estuary deposit, no vestiges of diatomaceæ have been observed.\r\n\r\nThe bed so rich in foraminifera, extends west and south-west of the\r\nWash. Mr. Smith sent me a mass of sandy clay, from a well sunk in the\r\ntown of March, to the depth of twenty-five feet, that was loaded with\r\nthese beautiful organisms.[343]\r\n\r\n[343] The reader interested in these inquiries should peruse the highly\r\ninteresting Memoir by Prof. Williamson, \"On some Microscopical Objects\r\nfound in the Mud of the Levant, and other Deposits.\" Manchester Phil.\r\nTrans, vol. viii.\r\n\r\nRecent Foraminiferous Deposit at Brighton.--An interesting fact\r\nconnected with the phenomena under review is deserving record. The\r\npresence of the fossils of an older formation, in strata subsequently\r\ndeposited, and in part composed of the detritus of the rocks whence the\r\norganic remains were derived, is not uncommon: such fossils are termed\r\nby the French geologists \"_fossiles remaniés_.\" The nature of these\r\nre-deposited fossils is generally obvious; either by the water-worn\r\ncondition of shells, bones, &c. or from their containing particles of\r\ntheir parent bed; or if casts, from their mineral composition. Thus\r\nin the chalk of St. Catherine's Mount, near Rouen, there are numerous\r\ncasts of Ammonites, Scaphites, and other shells, composed of marl full\r\nof particles of greensand. These have evidently been washed out of the\r\npreceding cretaceous beds of firestone or glauconite; and re-deposited\r\nin the chalk strata in which they are now imbedded.[344] * * * * *\r\n\r\n[344] M. D'Orbigny.\r\n\r\nAlong the sea-shore, to the east of Brighton, there is a bank of\r\nsand and calcareous mud, the detritus of the neighbouring cliffs,\r\nin the progress of formation; and in this sediment Mr. Reginald\r\nMantell discovered recent Rotaliæ, Nodosariæ, &c., with frustules\r\nof Bacillariæ, Coscinodisci, Naviculæ, and other diatomaceæ;\r\nassociated with cretaceous polythalamia washed out of the chalk,[345]\r\nThe difference in the aspect of the recent and fossil organisms\r\nwas so evident, as to leave no doubt of the correctness of this\r\ninterpretation. Here, then, at the present moment, a deposit is going\r\non, whose organic contents consist of an assemblage of species of\r\nliving animalcules of our seas, with the fossil forms of the ancient\r\nchalk ocean; in like manner as in the bed of the Nile, the Nummulites\r\nof the tertiary rocks are being imbedded with the existing mollusks and\r\ndesmidiæ of that river (_ante_, p. 345).\r\n\r\n[345] See _ante_, p. 99.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE FORAMINIFERA.]\r\n\r\nGeological distribution of the Foraminifera.--According to the\r\nobservations of M. D'Orbigny, the first appearance of the tribes of\r\nminute beings which have played so important a part in the elaboration\r\nof materials for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the\r\nsecondary and tertiary ages, and are at this moment invisible but\r\npowerful agents in the accumulation of calcareous sediments at the\r\nbottom of the sea, was in the Carboniferous epoch, and by a single\r\ntype, the _Fusulina_ (_ante_, p. 346). I believe no certain evidence\r\nof the occurrence of Foraminifera in Silurian or Devonian deposits has\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nM. D'Orbigny gives the following summary of the distribution of the\r\nknown fossil and recent species:--\r\n\r\n                            GENERA.

M. D'Orbigny's recent\r\nTables[346] give for the Jurassic or Oolite 10 genera; Cretaceous, 38\r\ngenera; Tertiary, 60 genera; but this estimate must be far too low.\r\n\r\n[346] Cours Elémentaire de Paléontologie.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavoured to convey a general idea of the highly\r\nimportant results obtained by the microscopical investigation of the\r\nminute organisms that enter so largely into the composition of many of\r\nthe fossiliferous deposits.\r\n\r\nWithout the aid of the most perfect optical instruments which modern\r\nscience and art have produced, even the existence of many of these\r\nstructures could not have been demonstrated; and we cannot doubt, that\r\nwere the powers of the microscope increased, the fossil remains of\r\nbeings still more minute would be detected; and that rocks and strata\r\nwhich now appear to consist of amorphous particles of lime, of silex,\r\nand of iron, would prove to be the aggregated skeletons of animals,\r\nyet more infinitesimal than those which have formed the subject of our\r\ncontemplations. How strikingly illustrative are these phenomena of the\r\nprofound remark of the illustrious Galileo--\"_La nature fait beaucoup\r\navec peu, et ses opérations sont toutes également merveilleuses._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF CHALK, FLINT, AND\r\nOTHER ROCKS.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF CHALK.]\r\n\r\nChalk.--The following method is that recommended by M. Ehrenberg, Place\r\na drop of water upon a plate of thin glass, and put into it as much\r\nscraped chalk as will cover the fine point of a knife, spreading it\r\nout, and leaving it to rest a few seconds; then withdraw the finest\r\nparticles which are suspended in the water, together with most of the\r\nliquid, and let the remainder become perfectly dry. Cover this dried\r\nspot of chalk with Canada balsam (the turpentine of _Abies balsamea_),\r\nand hold the plate of glass over the flame of a lamp, until the balsam\r\nbecomes slightly fluid, without froth or air-bubbles; it should be\r\nmaintained in this position (the glass being kept as hot as the finger\r\nwill bear) for a few minutes, until the balsam is found to have\r\nthoroughly permeated the substance to be examined. It is preferable\r\nto place a piece of very thin glass upon the balsam, and gently press\r\nit down, and allow it to remain. The best flatted crown-glass should\r\nbe used for placing the chalk or other objects on. It is convenient\r\nto have the slips of glass of one size, or the specimens will require\r\ndifferent boxes for their reception; three inches by one inch is that\r\nusually employed. These objects require to be viewed with a power\r\nmagnifying three hundred times linear, that is, in diameter; and if the\r\nprocess has been properly conducted, it will be seen that the chalk is\r\nchiefly composed of well-preserved organisms. In these preparations\r\nthe cells of the foraminifera appear at first black, with a white\r\ncentral spot; this is caused by the air contained in those cavities,\r\nfor air-bubbles always appear as black annular bodies; by degrees,\r\nthe balsam penetrates into all the single cells, the black rings\r\nof the air vesicles disappear, and the structure of the original is\r\nbeautifully displayed.[347]\r\n\r\n[347] Specimens of chalk, flint, and other rocks for examination; or\r\nspecimens prepared on slides, may be obtained of the microscopic\r\nartists, named in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoft part of Rotaliæ in chalk.--The manner in which I obtained the\r\nunmineralized soft bodies of foraminifera from chalk has already\r\nbeen mentioned (_ante_, p. 360); but it may be useful to offer a\r\nfew additional suggestions; for such fossil remains are not easily\r\nextracted. Many experienced microscopical observers have not succeeded\r\nin obtaining one good specimen; but others have been more fortunate, or\r\npersevering.\r\n\r\nIn several glass test-tubes, (the more the greater chance of success,)\r\nput a few grains of chalk powder: pour the tube half full of diluted\r\nhydrochloric (muriatic) acid--about ten parts water to one of\r\nacid--agitate, and set the mixture by: when all action has ceased add\r\none or two drops of undiluted acid to each tube, and repeat the process\r\nat due intervals till all the calcareous matter is dissolved. Pour\r\noff the fluid, substitute distilled water, agitate, and then let the\r\nsediment subside. The residue will consist of atoms of quartz and other\r\ninsoluble mineral matter, and animal tissue, if there be any. Then,\r\nwith a camel-hair pencil, place a small portion of the sediment on a\r\nglass slide, and when dry cover it with Canada balsam, and treat it as\r\nabove directed. Among a dozen slides thus mounted, there will probably\r\nbe two or more good examples of the body, or detached membranous\r\nsegments of Rotaliæ or Textulariæ, like those figured in _Lign. 118_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalcareous Sandstones and Marls.--These substances may be examined by\r\nthe same process; but if of loose texture, Dr. Bailey recommends that\r\nsome of the sandy powder should be spread very thinly on a plate of\r\nglass, with or without water, and by the aid of a lens of moderate\r\npower the roundish grains should be selected and picked up with fine\r\nforceps, or the point of a needle, and transferred to another piece of\r\nglass, having on one spot a thin coat of Canada balsam. This should\r\nbe gently heated over a spirit lamp, when the balsam will penetrate\r\nthe grains, and render them transparent; by this process the minutest\r\nshells, &c. may be detected. For a hasty exploration, the dust may be\r\nrendered sufficiently transparent by a drop or two of oil of turpentine.\r\n\r\nSandy calcareous marls may be examined by diffusing a few grains in\r\nwater in a wine-glass, the lighter portions will be suspended in the\r\nfluid, and may be placed on glass, and when dry prepared with Canada\r\nbalsam in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF FLINT.]\r\n\r\nFlint.--Flint, and other siliceous stones, require to be chipped into\r\nvery thin fragments, and immersed in oil of turpentine. A clear,\r\ntranslucent flint should be selected, from which fragments may be\r\nshattered off by smart blows of a hammer, over a sheet of white paper:\r\nthe most transparent flakes are to be selected, and these should be put\r\nin oil of turpentine, in a wide-mouth glass bottle. Take out the pieces\r\nfor examination with forceps, and inspect them as transparent objects,\r\nby transmitted light. When good specimens are discovered, mount them in\r\nCanada balsam.\r\n\r\nIt is hazardous to entrust such fossils to the lapidaries; an\r\ninteresting group of twenty spiniferites was reduced to ten, by one of\r\nour best workmen, in whose hands it was placed for polishing, with the\r\nview of rendering it more transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL TESTACEOUS MOLLUSCA, OR SHELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 120. Fossil Oyster, from the Chalk.\r\n\r\n_Kemptown, Brighton._]\r\n\r\nOn Fossil Mollusca.--Numerous as are the fossil remains of the various\r\ntypes of animal organization which have already passed under review,\r\nthey are far exceeded in number and variety by those of the beings\r\nwhose mineralized relics we now propose to investigate. Although every\r\none is familiar with the external appearance of the shells cast up by\r\nthe waves on the shores of our island, and of those which, from their\r\nvaried colours and elegant forms, are preserved in the cottage of the\r\npeasant, and in the mansion of the rich, but few persons are conversant\r\nwith the nature of the animals that secreted and were protected by\r\nthese beautiful and enduring structures. The organization even of the\r\noyster, mussel, whelk, &c., is known only to the naturalist. Appearing\r\nto the uninstructed eye as a shapeless gelatinous mass, there is\r\nnothing to arrest the attention, or excite the curiosity. Yet the\r\nbeings which inhabited these durable cases, are objects of the highest\r\ninterest and present a rich field of instructive investigation.\r\n\r\nExcept as shedding some light on the structure and economy of their\r\ninhabitants, the shells, in the estimation of the naturalist, are\r\nthe least interesting part of the organization of the Mollusca; but\r\nto the geologist, from their permanent nature, and the proofs they\r\nyield of the conditions under which the strata that contain them were\r\ndeposited, they are important in the highest degree. It has even been\r\nfound convenient to classify formations, in which fossil shells largely\r\nprevail, by the relative numerical proportion of the recent and extinct\r\nspecies found in the different groups of strata; and the terms, Eocene,\r\nMiocene, and Pliocene, (proposed by Sir C. Lyell,) have reference to\r\nthis character, as we have previously explained (_ante_, p. 24).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL MOLLUSCA.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mollusca_, a name indicative of the soft nature of the integuments\r\nof these animals, constitute a very comprehensive subdivision of the\r\nanimal kingdom, and are separable into two principal groups, viz. the\r\n_Acephala_ and the _Encephala_.\r\n\r\nI. The Acephala (so termed because they are destitute of a head) have\r\nneither jaws, tongue, nor a distinct mouth. They are aquatic, and\r\nare subdivided into classes, according to the modification of their\r\nintegument, or of their gills.\r\n\r\n_a._ The Tunicata (from the elastic _tunic_, or _mantle_, in which\r\nthey are enclosed) have no shell, and therefore do not come within\r\nthe scope of our inquiries: yet it is possible that the soft parts\r\neven of these perishable structures may have left some trace, or that\r\nmarkings of their integument on the silt or mud may be preserved;[348]\r\nand I would recommend the student to search for such indications on the\r\nrippled surface of clays and sandstones.\r\n\r\n[348] The _Ischadites Königi_ of the Ludlow rock was supposed to\r\nresemble _Boltenia_, a pedunculated Ascidian.\r\n\r\n_b._ The Brachiopoda (_arm-feet_) have two long spiral fleshy arms,\r\nor brachia, developed from the sides of the alimentary orifice, are\r\nenclosed in bivalve shells, and respire by means of their vascular\r\nskin, or mantle. They have not the power of locomotion, but are fixed\r\nby a peduncle to other bodies.\r\n\r\n_c._ The Lamellibranchia (_plated gills_) have also bivalve shells, but\r\ntheir respiration is effected by gills composed of vascular membrane\r\ndisposed in plates, and attached to the mantle; the _beard_ of the\r\nOyster is the branchial or respiratory apparatus of that animal. These\r\nbivalve Mollusca are subdivided into those which close their shells\r\nby one adductor muscle, hence called _monomyaria_, as the Oyster;\r\nand those which have two muscles, _dimyaria_, as the Cockle. As the\r\nimpressions left on the shells, by the attachment of these adductor\r\nmuscles, and by the margin of the mantle, are found as perfect in\r\nthe fossil as in the recent, they constitute important distinctive\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray's definition of the respective parts of univalve and bivalve\r\nshells is at once clear, concise, and natural, being conformable to the\r\nstructure of the body of the enclosed mollusk.\r\n\r\nThe _front_ of the shell is the part which covers the head of the\r\nanimal; the back of the shell is the part which covers the tail; the\r\nleft and right sides correspond with the same parts of the mollusk.\r\n\r\nIn univalves, the apex of the shelly cone whether it be simply conical\r\nor spiral (except in Patella) is over the hinder part of the animal:\r\nwhen the shell is placed on its mouth with the apex towards the\r\nobserver, the parts of the shell correspond with the position of the\r\nperson looking at it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 121.

A bivalve placed with the hinge\r\nside uppermost and the ligament towards the observer is in the same\r\nrelative position as the person looking at it; viz. the head in front,\r\nand the right and left valves in their natural relations. The length\r\nof the shell is therefore from the front to the back of the animal:\r\nthe width or transverse diameter is from the umbo to the margin.\r\nMuch confusion has arisen from many conchologists having described\r\nthe length and width of a shell diametrically opposite to the proper\r\nposition of its inhabitant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Encephalous Mollusca.--These possess a head, with feelers or\r\nsoft tentacula, eyes, and a mouth with jaws; they are arranged in\r\nclasses, according to the modification of their locomotive organs; for,\r\nwith but few exceptions, they are free animals, and can crawl, climb,\r\nor swim. Their shells are, for the most part, composed of one piece,\r\nor valve, hence they are termed _Univalves_. In some genera the shell\r\nis a simple cavity, spirally disposed, as in the Snail; in others, it\r\nis conical, consisting of one or many pieces, as in the _Limpet_ and\r\n_Chiton_. In the Cephalopoda it is internally divided into cells, or\r\nchambers, as, for example, in the Nautilus.\r\n\r\nThe Encephalous Mollusca are subdivided into the following classes;\r\nviz.--\r\n\r\n_a._ Pteropoda (_wing-feet_).--In these the organs of progression are\r\ntwo wing-like muscular expansions, proceeding from the sides of the\r\nneck, by which they can swim and float in the open sea: all the species\r\nare of small size.\r\n\r\n_b._ Gasteropoda (_feet under the body_).--These crawl by means of a\r\nmuscular disk, or foot, which is attached to the under-part of the\r\nbody; most of the species are marine, but some are terrestrial, and\r\nothers inhabit fresh-water. They are very widely distributed; the\r\ngarden snail is a familiar instance of a terrestrial Gasteropod.\r\n\r\n_c._ Cephalopoda (_feet around the head_).--The mollusca of this order\r\nhave powerful muscular arms, or tentacula, which surround the head,\r\nor upper part of the body; some genera have no shell, but possess an\r\ninternal skeleton, as the recent Sepiadæ and the fossil Belemnitidæ.\r\nMost of the testaceous Cephalopoda have a discoidal, univalve shell,\r\nwhich is divided internally by septa or partitions; as the Nautilus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL MOLLUSCA.]\r\n\r\nIn many univalves the aperture or opening is entire, that is, without\r\nany notch or groove; in others it is notched or extended into a canal,\r\nor siphon, and this character has relation to the respiratory organs:\r\nthus the Gasteropods, in which the water is conducted to the interior\r\nby a muscular tube, or siphon, have the margin of the aperture of the\r\nshell channelled; as in the Whelk, or _Buccinum_. Many of the land\r\nand fresh-water species have entire openings, and are, for the most\r\npart, herbivorous; while the greater number of the marine univalves\r\nhave the aperture indented or notched, and are carnivorous.[349] Some\r\nof these mollusca, too, have a retractile proboscis, armed with minute\r\nteeth, by which they can rasp or bore into the shells of the species\r\non which they prey. There are some exceptions to the above rules,\r\nbut the prevalence of the characters specified afford pretty certain\r\nindications of the fluviatile or marine nature of the originals.\r\nThe application of these data to geological investigations will be\r\nconsidered hereafter.\r\n\r\n[349] The form of the aperture does not necessarily indicate fresh-water\r\ngenera. _Melanopsis_, _Pirena_, and most of the _Melaniæ_ have a\r\nchannelled or notched aperture. Fresh-water univalves frequently have\r\nthe spire corroded; in a fossil state they can only be determined\r\n[to be fresh-water species] by their analogy to recent genera and\r\nsub-genera.--_Note by Mr. Woodward._\r\n\r\nIn the generic distinctions of the simple univalves, the form of\r\nthe mouth is an important character; while in the bivalves, the\r\nconfiguration of the hinge affords an equally convenient aid for their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nSome tribes of testaceous mollusca are exclusively marine; many are\r\nrestricted to the brackish water of estuaries; others live only in\r\nfresh-water; and some on the land. Their geographical distribution is\r\nalike various: certain groups inhabit deep water only, and are provided\r\nwith means by which they can maintain themselves near the surface of\r\nthe ocean, far away from any shore; while others are littoral, that is,\r\nlive in the shallows along the sea-shores. Many exist in quiet, others\r\nin turbulent waters; some are gregarious, like the oyster; while others\r\noccur singly, or in groups. The vertical range, that is, the relative\r\ndepths in which the mollusca live in the sea, is also strictly defined;\r\ncertain genera being, in a great measure, restricted to moderate\r\ndepths, others to a few fathoms, and many to the profound abysses of\r\nthe ocean, which neither the dredge nor the plummet can reach. All\r\nthese varieties of condition are more or less strongly impressed on\r\nthe shells, which may be considered as external skeletons;[350] and\r\nthe accomplished conchologist is enabled, by certain characters, to\r\ndetermine the nature of the animals which inhabited them, and the\r\nphysical conditions in which they were placed.[351]\r\n\r\n[350] In equivalve bivalves the animal lives in an upright position. In\r\ninequivalves, _i.e._ one large and one small valve, the animal lies on\r\nits side. The situation of bivalve shells, as oysters, should therefore\r\nbe noticed, for if they lie on their concave shell, with the flat valve\r\nuppermost, it is evident they were overwhelmed in their native bed and\r\nin a living state; if they lie indiscriminately on either valve, they\r\nwere probably dead shells and overwhelmed in that state. If the pallial\r\nimprint is notched by a sinus, it shows the presence and size of the\r\ntubes of the mantle. Whether there be one or two muscular impressions\r\nis of far less importance.\r\n\r\n[351] For an extended notice of the geographical distribution of\r\ntestacea, see Prof. Edward Forbes, British Marine Zoology, Part I. p.\r\n141.\r\n\r\nThe number of living species of mollusca known to naturalists, not\r\nincluding the shell-less genera, exceeds twelve thousand; and almost\r\nevery day is adding new species, for scarcely a vessel arrives from\r\ndistant seas without enriching the stores of the conchologist. The\r\nnumerous genera into which they are divided by systematists, and the\r\nconstant changes effected in arrangement and nomenclature by every\r\nwriter on the subject, render it difficult if not impossible to present\r\nthe reader with any satisfactory epitome of modern conchology.\r\n\r\nI must restrict myself to a brief account of some of the most\r\ncommon genera that occur in the British strata; and shall dwell\r\nmore particularly on those species which prevail in the secondary\r\nformations, because they present the most important deviations from\r\nthe recent types that are familiar to the general observer; by this\r\nmeans, and by reference to figures in standard works, the collector\r\nwill, I trust, be enabled to identify the fossil shells which may\r\nmost frequently come under his notice in the course of his geological\r\nrambles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS; INCLUDING THE BRACHIOPODA AND LAMELLIBRANCHIA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nAlthough in the modern Tertiary strata, as the Crag, and in the\r\narenaceous beds of the Eocene formations, shells are generally found\r\nin so perfect a state, that no caution or knowledge is requisite for\r\ntheir collection, yet a few preliminary remarks are necessary to point\r\nout certain conditions in which the remains of mollusca, or evidence of\r\ntheir existence, occur in the mineral kingdom, and particularly in the\r\nolder fossiliferous rocks. Shells are found in the strata in the three\r\nfollowing states:--\r\n\r\n1stly. Shells in which the constituent substance has undergone but\r\nlittle change. Many of the specimens in the sands of the Crag in\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk, and in the Eocene beds at Grignon, near Paris,\r\nand the Pliocene of Palermo, in Sicily, are as perfect as if collected\r\nfrom the sea-shore, having suffered no loss but that of colour. In\r\nsome instances, even the varied markings on the surface remain; but in\r\ngeneral the shells are bleached, or have a ferruginous stain.\r\n\r\n2dly. The form preserved, but the constituent substance mineralized.\r\nThis state is very common in shells that are imbedded in hard rock,\r\nwhatever may be the age of the deposit. In calcareous strata the\r\ntestaceous substance is generally transmuted into calcareous spar, as\r\nin most of the specimens from the chalk, oolite, mountain limestone,\r\n&c. In sands abounding in silex, the shell is changed into flint, as\r\nin the exquisite fossils from the Greensand of Blackdown, Devonshire;\r\nin deposits permeated with sulphuret of iron, the shells are often\r\nmetamorphosed into pyrites, as in the Ammonites in the Lias, Galt, &c.\r\n\r\n3dly, In the state of casts and impressions. Although in loose sand\r\nthe shells are either empty, or filled with detritus easily removable\r\nby washing; in clay, limestone, and sandstone, the cavities are\r\ngenerally occupied by consolidated materials, which had entered when in\r\na soft or fluid state; and frequently the substance of the shell has\r\ndisappeared, and the stony cast of the interior alone remains. In many\r\ninstances, the spaces left by the dissolution of the shells are filled\r\nwith spar, or the casts are closely invested by the surrounding stone,\r\nfrom long-continued superincumbent pressure while the matrix was in\r\na plastic state; and in such cases the casts are often distorted and\r\nflattened. But the vacancy is occasionally empty, and on its walls is\r\nfound an impress of the external surface of the shell, with all the\r\nlines and ornaments of the original as sharp as if cast in plaster of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 122. Turritellæ, from Bracklesham, Sussex. _Tert._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Turritella conoidea; the perfect shell: _nat._\r\n\r\n       2.--Septarium, with Turritellæ; a polished slab: 1/3 _nat._\r\n\r\n       3.--A cast of one of the shells, in calcareous spar: _nat._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEPTARIUM WITH SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nThe specimen, _Lign. 122, fig. 2_, from the tertiary strata at\r\nBracklesham Bay, Sussex, is a polished slice of indurated argillaceous\r\nlimestone, from a septarium (_nodule divided by fissures_), abounding\r\nin spiral univalve shells, called _Turritellæ_. _Fig. 1_ is a perfect\r\nshell of the same species, extracted from soft clay; and _fig. 3_, a\r\ncast in calcareous spar, obtained from the septarium. In the polished\r\nslab, _fig. 2_, sections of numerous shells are seen. The dark\r\npartitions, or septa, are veins of spar, which occupy interstices\r\nthat have been formed in the clay-nodule by shrinking; and if the\r\nspecimen be closely examined, the shells will be found split across and\r\ndisplaced by the fissures; thus presenting an interesting illustration\r\nof the faults, or dislocations, of the strata, so familiar to the\r\ngeological observer. In the present instance, the lines on the exterior\r\nof the shell do not materially differ from those on the interior, and,\r\nconsequently, the cast, _fig. 3_, and the shell. _fig. 1_, resemble\r\neach other; but in many species there is a striking contrast between\r\nthe outer and inner surfaces, the external aspect being strongly\r\nornamented, while the internal is smooth; the cast, therefore, in\r\nsuch examples, so little resembles the shell, that an inexperienced\r\ncollector may readily suppose it belongs to a different species. The\r\nbivalve called Trigonia, _Lign. 127, figs. 1, 2_, is an instance of\r\nthis contrast.\r\n\r\nThe polished slab of the Septarium, _Lign. 122, fig. 2_, demonstrates\r\nanother condition of fossil shells--that of a compact argillaceous\r\nlimestone--and entire beds of marble are composed of an aggregation\r\nof this kind, formed of shells and other animal exuviæ, consolidated\r\nby mineral infiltrations. In the older secondary strata this state\r\nprevails; and the beautiful markings of many valuable marbles, are\r\nmerely sections of the enclosed shells. But this process is not\r\nrestricted to the deposits of ancient date; at the present moment\r\nthe same operation is silently but constantly going on in our seas,\r\nand an examination of the specimen, _Lign. 123_, will afford an\r\nexemplification of the manner in which these shelly limestones are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BRIGHTON SHELL-CONGLOMERATE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 123.

It is a fragment of a large block, dredged\r\nup from the British Channel, off Brighton. Similar masses have been\r\nobtained at different soundings along this part of the Sussex coast;\r\nand in some specimens numerous other species of recent shells, as\r\noysters, mussels, whelks, &c. enter into the composition of the\r\nconsolidated rock. The shelly and coralline limestones and sandstones,\r\nso abundant in the ancient strata of England have been formed in a\r\nsimilar manner; and when the modern conglomerate of Brighton shall have\r\nbeen permeated with crystalline matter, and subjected to great pressure\r\nby superincumbent deposits, through countless centuries, and at length\r\nbe elevated above the waters, it will constitute beds of shell-marble,\r\nin some mountain range, and become an interesting, perhaps the only\r\nmemento, of the races of mollusca and polypiaria of the present seas,\r\nwhen all record and traces of Great Britain and its inhabitants shall\r\nbe destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 124.

There is but a\r\nscanty mixture of earth, and the shells are clean, and look as if\r\nthey had been washed ashore after the death of their inhabitants. In\r\nsome places the beds are sandy, and are hardening into a calcareous\r\nshelly sandstone. In one such bed the superficial stratum furnished\r\na few bones of turtles and undetermined fragments, the bones of some\r\nlarge vertebrate animal. This is, I believe, the locality where\r\nCount Pourtalés collected human bones in a recent sandstone.... No\r\nmicroscopical forms were detected in these beds after the most careful\r\nsearch.\"[352]\r\n\r\n[352] Dr. J, W. Bailey, in Smithsonian Contributions, vol. ii.

They have been humorously called the _Fossil\r\nAristocracy_, from the incalculable antiquity of their lineage.\r\n\r\nThe species are very numerous; more than 300 extinct forms have been\r\ndetermined.[353] Those figured in _Lign. 125_ are from the White Chalk,\r\nand are beautifully preserved; even vestiges of the colour occasionally\r\nremain. In a living state, the animal is fixed to foreign bodies by a\r\nbyssus, or peduncle, which passes through the opening in the beak, or\r\narched extremity, of the shells,[354] The most interesting circumstance\r\nrelating to these mollusca, is the respiratory apparatus, which\r\nconsists of two long ciliated tubes, spirally coiled, united at their\r\nbase, and supported by slender calcareous processes, which are often\r\npreserved in the fossils. Thus, in specimens from the soft chalk, the\r\ncalcareous earth may be removed from the interior of the shell, and\r\nthe appendages exposed, as in the examples, _Lign. 126, figs. 1, 2_;\r\nand in the shells that are empty, these processes occasionally remain\r\ndistinct, or are coated by a thin pellicle of calcareous spar, or\r\npyrites.\r\n\r\n[353] See Catalogue of _Terebratulidæ_, published for the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[354] In the British Museum (Eastern Zoological Gallery, case table A)\r\nthere are between thirty and forty recent terebratulæ (_T. australis_,\r\nQuoy, a plaited species, much resembling _T. fimbria_ of the Inf.\r\nOolite, Cheltenham) attached with their byssi to a block of stone, from\r\nPort Jackson, where it was found by Mr. Jukes just below low-water.\r\n\r\nIn the smooth _Terebratulæ_, the laminations of the shell are full of\r\nminute perforations, which may be seen by a lens of moderate power; the\r\nappearance of this structure, when highly magnified, is shown _fig._\r\n2a, _Lign. 126_.[355] The Rhynchonellæ (as _Lign. 125, figs. 1, 2_,)\r\ndo not possess this organization.\r\n\r\n[355] An interesting Memoir on the Microscopal Examination of Shells has\r\nrecently been communicated to the Royal Society by Dr. Carpenter.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Terebratula are found both living and fossil,\r\n_e.g._ _Terebratula vitrea_, living in the Mediterranean, fossil in\r\nSicily,--_T. caput-serpentis_, recent in the British seas, fossil in\r\nthe Crag,--and _T. lenticularis_, both recent and fossil in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 126.

Among these, the Spirifers are the most\r\ninteresting, on account of their spiral calcareous processes, which\r\nin the recent state supported the ciliated _brachia_, being often\r\npreserved. A specimen, in which part of the upper valve of the shell\r\nhas been removed, and one of the spires exposed, is figured _Lign.\r\n126, fig. 3_. (_Wond._ pp. 735, 736).[356]\r\n\r\n[356] See a Memoir on the Anatomy of the Brachiopoda, by Professor Owen.\r\nZoological Trans, vol. i. p. 145, _et seq._\r\n\r\nAll these genera are extinct; they prevail in the oldest fossiliferous\r\nrocks, and gradually disappear as we ascend to the newer formations;\r\nthe last trace of their existence is in the Lias, in which one species\r\nhas been found. But the _Terebratulæ_ abound in the Lias, Oolite,\r\nChalk, &c., occur in the tertiary formations, and several living\r\nspecies inhabit the seas around Australia and New Zealand. (See _ante_\r\np. 390.)\r\n\r\nRhynchonella, _Fischer_. The \"_plaited_\" _Terebratulæ_ differ from the\r\ntypical species (_e.g._ _T. australis_, caput-serpentis, vitrea, &c.)\r\nmore than even the Spirifers differ, and must be regarded as forming\r\na distinct _family_, Rhynchonellidæ, which will include _Pentamerus_.\r\nThe shell is not punctate; the arms are spiral, supported only at their\r\norigins by shelly processes; the larger valve is _beaked_ acutely,\r\nand has a notch within the beak through which the pedicle passes;\r\nsometimes the notch is converted into a foramen, by two little plates,\r\n(_deltidium_,) as in _Terebratula_. The form of the Rhynchonellæ is\r\ntetrahedral. _Lign. 125_.\r\n\r\nPentamerus, _Ly._ p. 352.--With the Spirifers, and other Brachiopoda\r\nof the Silurian System, some bivalves which, in their general figure,\r\nresemble certain species of Terebratulæ, frequently occur. These shells\r\ndiffer in their internal structure from all other genera, in having a\r\nseptum, or plate, by which their cavity is divided into four chambers;\r\nand in one valve the septum itself contains a cell, thus making five\r\nchambers, whence the name _Pentamerus_ (_five-celled_). The casts of\r\nthese shells often have fissures, produced by the decomposition of\r\nthe septa; and occasionally these cavities are occupied by calcareous\r\nspar. Specimens of this kind commonly split into two parts, in one of\r\nwhich two, and in the other three, chambers may be detected; the fifth\r\nchamber is the canal of the peduncle. Four species are known, and all\r\nbelong to the Silurian rocks.\r\n\r\nOrthis, Leptæna, and Producta form a third family, with horizontal\r\nspiral arms, unsupported by shelly processes. _Davidsonia_ is a Leptæna\r\n_attached_ by the ventral valve, and the only genus in this family\r\nwhich is fixed by _the shell itself_.\r\n\r\nCalceola. a genus of Brachiopoda; the shell of an inverted pyramidal\r\nform, the upper valve nearly flat; found in the Devonian strata of the\r\nEifel, and in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nCrania, _Ly._ _fig._ 205. These are small brachiopodous shells,\r\nattached to other bodies; very frequently to the Echinites of the\r\nchalk. The free valve is commonly wanting, but I have found specimens\r\ndispersed in the rock. In many of the quarries in Kent and Sussex, the\r\nhelmet Echinites bear groups of these shells. _Ly. _fig._ 13._\r\n\r\nOrbicula. This genus resembles Crania in form, the upper valve being\r\nlike a limpet, whilst the attached valve is flat; it differs, however,\r\nfrom Crania in being horny and flexible, and is fixed to rocks on the\r\nbed of the sea, by a muscular pedicle passing out through a small\r\nfissure.\r\n\r\nSpecies of Orbicula are found in strata of all ages, from the Lower\r\nSilurian to the Tertiary, and several are now living in tropical seas.\r\n\r\nObolus. _Eichwald._ In the Lower Silurian (_Obolite grit_) of Sweden\r\nand Russia, is a Lingula, with a hinge and a notch for the pedicle; it\r\nhas not hitherto been found in Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINGULA. HIPPURITES.]\r\n\r\nLingula. _Ly._ p. 353, _fig._ 412.--The Brachiopoda referred to this\r\ngenus have a long peduncle, and their respiratory apparatus has no\r\ncalcareous support; the recent species burrow in the sand, being\r\nusually inhabitants of shallow waters. The _Lingulæ_ aære readily\r\ndistinguished from the Terebratulæ by their imperforate, equivalved\r\nshells. One species is found in the Aymestry limestone, and several\r\nhave been collected from the Mountain limestone, Oolite, and Shanklin\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith reference to the species of Brachiopoda, particularly of the\r\nTerebratulæ, which inhabit the depths of the ocean, Professor Owen\r\nobserves, that \"both the respiration and nutrition of animals, which\r\nexist beneath a pressure of from sixty to ninety fathoms of sea-water,\r\nare subjects suggestive of interesting reflections, and lead us to\r\ncontemplate with less surprise the great strength and complexity of\r\nsome of the minutest parts of the frame of these diminutive creatures.\r\nIn the unbroken stillness which pervades those abysses, the existence\r\nof these animals must depend on their power of exciting a perpetual\r\ncurrent around them, in order to dissipate the water laden with their\r\neffete particles, and to bring within the reach of their prehensile\r\norgans the animalcules adapted for their sustenance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHippurites. This genus belongs to a group of fossil shells whose\r\ncharacters are somewhat problematical, some conchologists referring\r\nthem to the ordinary bivalves, and others to the Brachiopoda. Although\r\n_Hippurites_ have not been discovered in the British strata, I am\r\ninduced to notice them in this place, in consequence of their great\r\nabundance in the Cretaceous deposits of the South of France, and in the\r\nOolite of the Pyrenees; and also to illustrate the nature of a nearly\r\nrelated genus, _Sphærulites_, of which one or more species occur in the\r\nSussex Chalk.\r\n\r\nThe Hippurite is of an elongated conical form, and fixed by its\r\nbase; it has internally a deep lateral channel, formed by two obtuse\r\nlongitudinal ridges. The base is sometimes partitioned off by\r\ntransverse septa, forming cells or cavities, as in the Euomphalus. The\r\naperture, or opening, is closed by an operculum, or upper valve. The\r\nsubstance of the shell is cellular, and very thick, and when fractured\r\nmuch resembles that of the lamelliferous corals: the laminæ are\r\nsometimes separated into cells, or cavities, like the Spondyli. These\r\nshells often attain considerable magnitude, and in certain districts of\r\nthe Pyrenees, where they abound, are called \"_petrified horns_\" by the\r\ninhabitants. It is remarkable, that, while in the Chalk of the South of\r\nFrance, Spain, Portugal, and Greece shells of this genus so prevail, as\r\nto be considered the characteristic fossils of the formation, in the\r\nNorth of France they are very rare, and in England have not hitherto\r\nbeen discovered.[357]\r\n\r\n[357] As marking the rapid progress of Palæontology in this country,\r\nit may be noticed that the _only fossil_ figured in the first edition\r\nof the Enclycopædia Britannica, in illustration of the article,\r\n\"_Petrifaction_,\" is one of these supposed petrified horns, described\r\nby the Abbé Fortis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFossil Shells of the Lamellibranchia.--These are bivalve shells, the\r\nanimals of which differ from the preceding class, as we have already\r\nstated, in performing respiration by means of lamellated gills. The\r\nvalves are united by a strong substance, termed the ligament, which,\r\nby its elasticity, admits of the shells being opened to a considerable\r\nextent; and they are closed by powerful, short, thick muscles, called\r\nadductors. The shells of some of the genera, as the Oyster and Scallop,\r\nhave but one muscle, (_monomyaria_); others, as the Cockle, or Cardium,\r\nand Venus, have two, (_dimyaria_); and by these characters the class is\r\narranged in two groups.\r\n\r\nMonomyaria: _Bivalve Shells, with one muscular impression_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL OYSTERS.]\r\n\r\nOstrea, _Lign. 120._--The Oyster is well known to possess no power of\r\nlocomotion; it is attached to rocks, pebbles, and other bodies, and\r\nforms extensive beds, consisting of numerous individuals, of all sizes.\r\nThere are many fossil species; the British strata yield between forty\r\nand fifty. In some localities. Oysters are found in thick beds, of\r\ngreat extent, apparently on the spots they occupied when living. One\r\nof the most interesting localities I am acquainted with, is Sundridge\r\nPark, near Bromley, in Kent, where a hard conglomerate, entirely made\r\nup of oyster-shells, and the shingle that formed their native bed,\r\nis quarried. This stone is much employed for ornamental rock-work,\r\nand several walls in and near Bromley are constructed of it: these\r\ndisplay the fossils, some with the valves closed, others open, others\r\ndetached, and the whole grouped as if artificially imbedded to expose\r\nthe characters of the shells. These oyster-beds belong to the tertiary\r\nstrata of the London basin; they extend to Plumstead, and other places\r\nin the vicinity; and in some localities, the oysters are associated\r\nwith other bivalves, called _Pectunculi_. In the tertiary clays near\r\nWoolwich and Bexley, fossil oyster-shells abound. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Reading, in Berkshire, an extensive layer of fossil oysters occupies\r\nthe same geological position, namely, the lowermost sands and clays\r\nof the London basin. Wherever the strata around London are perforated\r\nto a sufficient depth, this oyster-bed is reached. Very recently an\r\nArtesian well was bored at Hanwell, in Middlesex, and at the depth of\r\ntwo hundred and eighty feet this stratum of sand with oyster-shells was\r\nfound. At Headley, near Reigate, in Surrey, there is a similar deposit.\r\nThese oysters very closely resemble the edible species.\r\n\r\nThe White Chalk contains several species of Ostrea, but I believe no\r\nbeds of these shells have been found in it; on the contrary, the\r\nshells are diffused promiscuously through the strata. I have collected\r\na few groups of from thirty to forty shells, evidently the young or\r\nfry of the species (_O. semiplana_) figured _Lign. 120_. This specimen\r\nis an interesting example of the petrifactive process which the\r\nmollusca have occasionally undergone; the soft parts of the oyster\r\nare transmuted into flint, and the shell is changed into carbonate of\r\nlime, having a crystalline structure. Both valves were perfect when\r\ndiscovered, but I chiselled off the greater part of one shell to expose\r\nthe silicified body of the animal.\r\n\r\nA small oyster, called _Ostrea vesicularis_, is a characteristic shell\r\nof the chalk; one valve is convex, the other flat; it is abundant in\r\nthe Chalk of Norfolk, and also in the Firestone of some localities:\r\nit is figured _Ly._ p. 212. Another small species, having the margin\r\nplicated (_O. plicata_), is also frequent in the Chalk. A large shell,\r\nwith the margins deeply indented by angular folds, resembling the\r\nrecent cockscomb oyster, is abundant in the Chalk Marl and Firestone;\r\nparticularly near Dover, and around Selbourne in Hampshire, where\r\nit attracted the notice of White, by its resemblance to the living\r\n\"Cockscomb Oyster\" of the West Indies; it is named _Ostrea carinata_,\r\nand figured _Ly._ p. 212, _fig._ 204. One other species may be noticed,\r\nthe Ostrea deltoidea, which has been found in every locality of the\r\nKimmeridge Clay in England and France. It is a very flat species, and\r\nof a triangular form; the specific name is derived from a supposed\r\nresemblance to the Greek letter Δ, _delta_. I believe that in England\r\nno shells of this genus have been observed in strata older than the\r\nLias.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 127.

The Gryphites\r\nare of a finer laminated structure than the oysters, and the ligament\r\nof the hinge is inserted in an elongated curved groove. There are\r\nabout thirty British fossil species, none of which have been noticed\r\nbelow the Lias, in which formation one very remarkable species is so\r\nabundant as to be considered characteristic of the Liassic deposits. It\r\nis so faithfully represented, _Lign. 127, _fig._ 6_, that description\r\nis unnecessary. In the upper argillaceous beds of the Oolite and\r\nKimmeridge Clay, a very small gryphite, (_G. virgula_, _Ly._ p. 260_)\r\nis so abundant, that it constitutes entire layers. The low cliffs on\r\nthe west of Boulogne harbour, like those near Weymouth, are composed\r\nof this clay, and myriads of the gryphites are scattered on the shore,\r\nwith other shells of the same deposits; these shelly beds are called\r\n_marnes à gryphées_, by the French geologists. A very large gryphite,\r\n_Gryphæa sinuata_, (_Min. Conch._ tab. 336,) is found in the Shanklin\r\nsand of the Isle of Wight, and of Kent and Sussex. At low water, in the\r\nsand along the shore under Dunnose Cliff, near Shanklin Chine, numerous\r\nspecimens are always obtainable.[358]\r\n\r\n[358] The name _Exogyra_ was applied to the Chama-shaped species of\r\nGryphæa by the late Mr. Sowerby, and other writers; but subsequent\r\nauthors have included these shells in the present genus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPONDYLUS. PLAGIOSTOMA.]\r\n\r\nSpondylus. _Lign. 128._--A species of this genus is so frequent in the\r\nChalk, that it ranks with certain Terebratulæ, as characteristic of\r\nthat formation. One valve is covered with long slender spines, which,\r\nin the usual examples, are destroyed by the mode of extracting them.\r\nThe specimen figured shows the appearance of a shell partly cleared;\r\nthe remainder of the chalk might be removed by a penknife (taking\r\ncare to leave the longest spines supported by brackets of chalk), and\r\nit would then resemble the beautiful fossils figured _Min. Conch._\r\ntab. 78, and in _Geol. S. E._ p. 125. Between the beaks there is a\r\ntriangular aperture in the spinous valve, which some naturalists, with\r\nmuch probability, suppose was once filled up with shell, as in the\r\nrecent species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 128. Spondylus spinosus. _In Chalk-flint. Lewes._]\r\n\r\nIn the cretaceous strata of North America, Dr. Morton has discovered\r\na Spondylus (_S. dumosus_) very nearly related to _S. spinosus_;\r\nbut it differs in its general form, and has both valves beset with\r\nstrong spines. I have the fragment of a large bivalve from the Kentish\r\nRag (Mr. Bensted's quarry), which has the peculiar structure of the\r\nWater-clam (_Spondylus varius_ of Mr. Broderip); namely, hollow\r\ninterspaces formed by shelly layers or partitions, which were secreted\r\nby the posterior part of the mantle, or investing integument of the\r\nanimal, as it gradually receded from that part of the shell. In the\r\nrecent Water-clam the cells are full of fluid.[359]\r\n\r\n[359] S\r\nee Penny Cyclop. Art, _Spondylidæ_.\r\n\r\nPlagiostoma, Llhwyd, 1699. This genus, adopted by Mr. Sowerby in\r\nthe Mineral Conchology, is scarcely distinguishable from _Lima_ of\r\nBruguiere (1791). Most of the recent species are ornamented with small\r\nasperities, from which the name _lima_ (file) is derived; they are\r\nsymmetrical shells attached by a byssus.\r\n\r\nSeveral smooth species of this genus are found in the Chalk,[360]\r\nOolite, and Lias. A very large species (_P. giganteum_), sometimes ten\r\ninches in diameter, abounds in the Lias (_Ly._ p. 274). It is somewhat\r\ndepressed in form, with the surface slightly striated; each valve has a\r\npointed beak, with two lateral expansions, or ears, as they are termed\r\nby conchologists.\r\n\r\n[360] See Foss. South Downs,, plate xxvi.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlicatula, is another genus of this family, of which there are three\r\nBritish fossil species. A delicate shell, with slender depressed spines\r\n(_P. inflata_. _Foss. South D._ pl. xxvi.), occurs in the Chalk Marl.\r\nThe recent species are natives of the seas of warm climates.\r\n\r\n\r\nPecten.--The common scallop-shell will serve as a type of this genus.\r\nThe animals of these shells, unlike the oysters, have the power of\r\nlocomotion, and when in the water, may be seen moving with rapidity,\r\nand flapping their shells to and fro with great activity. Numerous\r\nspecies are found fossil. In the Pliocene, and other marine tertiary\r\ndeposits, Pectens abound; in the White Chalk there are several elegant\r\nforms (see _Foss. South D._ plate xxv.); many kinds in the Oolite and\r\nLias; and several in the Devonian strata.\r\n\r\nA large Mediterranean species (_Pecten Jacobæus_, _Ly._ p. 152)\r\noccurs in the Pliocene strata of Palermo, in every stage of growth,\r\nand as perfect as if recent. The Chalk and Shanklin sand contain a\r\nsmall inequivalved Pecten, the lower valve of which is convex, and\r\npentangular, the upper flat, and both strongly ribbed, or pectinated;\r\nit is named _Pecten quinquecostatus_ (_Foss. South D._ pl. xxvi. _Ly._\r\np. 212); and in the cretaceous strata of North America a variety of\r\nthis species is found.\r\n\r\nIn the Chalk Marl a large and beautiful Pecten (_P. Beaveri. Min.\r\nConch._ tab. 158) is very common, and I have obtained from Hamsey and\r\nSoutherham examples in the most perfect state of preservation; it is\r\na characteristic shell of the Chalk Marl of England (_Foss.

The shell, in consequence of the vertical\r\narrangement of the fibres, readily breaks to pieces, and it is often\r\nextremely difficult to extricate a specimen with the hinge and beaks\r\ntolerably entire. That they were equally brittle when recent is evident\r\nfrom the numerous fragments diffused through the chalk and flint, and\r\noccasionally imbedded in pyrites.[364] The form of the hinge is shown\r\nin _Lign. 129, fig. 1_: in the lower specimen two valves of the same\r\nindividual are seen displaced, one lying over the other. The usual\r\nchalk species are figured _Foss. South D._ pl. xxvii. and in _Min.\r\nConch._\r\n\r\n[361] The term Inoceramus is restricted by the French geologists to the\r\nbeaked and laminated species of the Galt; and the chalk Inocerami are\r\narranged under the name _Catillus_.\r\n\r\n[362] _Perna_ and all the Aviculidæ have the same structure, Inoceramus\r\nscarcely differs from Perna.\r\n\r\n[363] Dr. Carpenter on the Microscopical Structure of Shells. To detect\r\nthis structure, the shell should be immersed in diluted hydrochloric\r\nacid, and when partially dissolved, the cells will be apparent.\r\n\r\n[364] It was many years before I succeeded in obtaining a specimen with\r\nthe hinge perfect; and M. Brongniart, unable to obtain one from the\r\nchalk of France, gave the figure of this genus from my Foss. South D.\r\npl. xxvii. in the Géog. Min. Env. de Paris.\r\n\r\nIn the Galt, or Folkstone-marl, two small species of this genus are to\r\nbe found in every locality I have visited. They were first figured and\r\ndescribed by Mr. Parkinson, under the name of _Inoceramus sulcatus_,\r\nand _I. concentricus_ (_Wond._ p. 330, fig. 1 and 3). In most examples\r\nthe shell is in the state of a white, friable earth, and readily\r\ndecomposes, leaving patches of iridescent nacre on the casts; but I\r\nhave seen examples which prove that the originals were of a fibrous\r\nstructure, like the Inocerami of the Chalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 130.

The shells are often cellular from this\r\ncause, and the cavities are found either hollow, or filled with chalk,\r\nor, as in the example _Lign. 130_, with flint. In the latter case, upon\r\nthe decomposition of the shell, the siliceous casts remain in relief on\r\nthe surface of the flint, as in _Lign. 130, b_. Such specimens are\r\ncommon in the broken flints of the South Downs, and in the shingle on\r\nthe sea-shore of chalk districts; and their origin would be difficult\r\nto understand without this explanation.[365]\r\n\r\n[365] The Rev. W. Conybeare first ascertained the origin of these\r\nfossils, and figured and described them in an elegant Memoir, published\r\nin Geol. Trans, vol. ii. first series. Mr. Morris proposes the name of\r\n_Clionites_ for the fossil bodies derived from the depredations of the\r\nCliona on the Inocerami and other shells. See Annals Nat. Hist. 1851,\r\nand my Pictorial Atlas of Organic Remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvicula. _Lyell_, p. 274.--Above fifty species of this genus of shells\r\nhave been found in the British strata; their general character will\r\nbe readily understood by reference to the pearl-oyster, (_Avicula\r\nmargaritifera_,) which is so largely imported for the manufacture\r\nof mother-of-pearl ornaments. A remarkable species is found in the\r\nLias, called, from the great disproportion in the size of the shells,\r\n_Avicula inæquivalvis_, (_Lyell_, p. 274.) The recent species are\r\ninhabitants of warm climates.\r\n\r\nOur limits will not admit of further notice of the _Monomyaria_, and we\r\nproceed to the second division of the plated-gilled mollusca.\r\n\r\n\r\nDimyaria: _Bivalve Shells, with two muscular imprints_.\r\n\r\nThe conchifera, or bivalve shells, of this group, found fossil, are\r\nmore than double in number those of the preceding; nearly eight\r\nhundred species are known in the rocks of Great Britain, of which by\r\nfar the greater number is marine. But we must restrict our notice of\r\nthis division to a few genera, that more space may be devoted to that\r\nimportant class, the Cephalopodous Mollusca.\r\n\r\nThe _Cardium_, _Venus_, and Mussel shells, are familiar examples of the\r\n_Dimyaria_. The conglomerates, now forming in the British Channel, from\r\naccumulations of the recent species of Cockle (_C. edule_), have been\r\npreviously noticed; see _Lign. 124_, p. 386. In the strata of England\r\nthere are upwards of thirty species: the Crag contains several,\r\nparticularly a large and delicate shell, the _Cardium Parkinsoni_\r\n(_Min. Conch._ tab. 49). Others are peculiar to the London clay, as the\r\n_Cardium semigranulatum_, a beautiful shell, having the surface smooth,\r\nexcept on the posterior side, which is covered with strong ridges,\r\nbeset with minute granules; it is found in many localities (_Min.\r\nConch._ tab. 144). Among the silicified shells of the Shanklin sand of\r\nDevonshire, an elegant Cardium, _C. Hillanum_, (_Min. Conch._ tab. 14,)\r\noccurs. But one species is known in the formations below the Lias: the\r\n_Cardium striatum_, (_Murch. Sil. Syst._ tab. 6, _fig._ 2,) found in\r\nthe Aymestry limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENERICARDIA. PECTUNCULUS.]\r\n\r\nVenericardia. _Ly._ p. 199.--These shells are abundant in the tertiary\r\nstrata; one large species, _V. planicosta_, (_Ly._ p. 199, _fig._ 171,)\r\nis found in immense quantities in the clay and sand at Bracklesham Bay,\r\nin Sussex, from the young to the adult state; some examples are very\r\nlarge, and perfect. In the sand at Grignon, near Paris, the same shell\r\nis abundant, possessing the usual white and delicate aspect of the\r\nfossils of that celebrated locality of the _Calcaire grossier_. Only\r\none species has been noticed in the British secondary strata.\r\n\r\n\r\nPectunculus. _Wond._ p. 244, _fig._ 8.--In the London clay at\r\nBracklesham Bay, Highgate, Hordwell Cliff, and in the arenaceous\r\nlimestone of Bognor rocks, an immense number of the bivalve shells,\r\ncalled _Pectunculi_ (_little pectens_), occur. Some of the French\r\nmarine tertiary strata also abound in the same, and other species of\r\nthis genus. In the above-mentioned Sussex localities, these shells are\r\nso numerous, as to be the most frequent fossils that come under the\r\nnotice of the collector. They are readily known from their associates\r\nby their rounded equivalve shells, and the single arched row of teeth\r\nalong the hinge, resembling the common _Arca_.[366] (See _Min. Conch._\r\ntab. 27). At Plumstead, near Woolwich, a smaller species is found; and\r\nalso occasionally with the oysters at Bromley.\r\n\r\n[366] The species so abundant at Bognor, is _P. brevirostris_, _Min.\r\nConch._ tab. 472. I have seen a block of the limestone, in which,\r\nspread over an area of a foot square, there were upwards of fifty\r\nspecimens lying in relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nNucula.--Several species of a small elegant bivalve, related to the\r\npreceding, but distinguished by having two rows of teeth on the hinge,\r\ndiverging from an interspace between the beaks, are found in the\r\nCrag and other tertiary deposits (_Min. Conch._ tab. 180, 192). Two\r\nspecies occur in the Galt (_Foss. South D._ pl. xix. _fig._ 5, 6, 9),\r\nat Ringmer, Folkstone, Bletchingley, &c., sometimes with the shell\r\nperfect, but generally in the state of casts composed of indurated\r\nclay, and having impressions of the muscles and of the two rows of\r\nhinge-teeth. The shell of one species is marked with fine transverse\r\ngrooves, or striæ (_N. pectinata_); the other is of a flattened ovate\r\nform, and the surface smooth (_N. ovata_).\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful species of Nucula are the _N. bivirgata_ of the Galt\r\nof Folkstone, and _F. Cobboldiæ_ of the Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Nucula_ with the posterior side produced into a long\r\nbeak have been separated under the name _Leda_; they have a pallial\r\nsinus, indicating a siphon to the mantle;--\r\n\r\n  _e.g._   _Nucula ovum_          Alum Shale.\r\n           _  --   claviformis_   Lias.\r\n           _  --   attenuata_     Coal Shale.\r\n           _  --   arctica_       Norwich Crag.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PINNA. MYTILUS. MODIOLA.]\r\n\r\nPinna.--The common large _Pinna_, of the Mediterranean, is well\r\nknown, and differs so entirely from other shells, as to be readily\r\ndistinguished. There are about fifteen or sixteen British fossil\r\nspecies. The earliest appearance of this genus is in the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone of Derbyshire (Phil. York. tab. 6), in which there are\r\ntwo species. The Lias contains one species; the Oolite eight; the\r\nCretaceous formation four; and the London clay two. One of the\r\ntertiary species, _Pinna affinis_ (_Min. Conch._ tab. 313), occurs in\r\nconsiderable numbers in the Bognor rocks, associated with Pectunculi;\r\nit varies in length from one to six or seven inches. A beautiful and\r\ndelicate species is found in the _Calcaire grossier_ of Grignon. Shells\r\nof this genus are very rare in the White Chalk, most of the supposed\r\n_Pinnæ_ being imperfect examples of _Inocerami_; but I have seen\r\nspecimens from Norfolk (collected by the late Mr. Woodward), and one\r\nfrom Sussex, in the cabinet of the Marquess of Northampton.[367]\r\n\r\n[367] Dr. Lee has recently discovered in the Kimmeridge Clay on his\r\nestate at Hartwell, Bucks, a species of Pinna not previously observed\r\nin England. Professor Forbes informs me that it resembles _Pinna\r\nconica_ (of Röemer), and is related to _P. lanceolata_ of Sowerby, but\r\nappears to be distinct from both.\r\n\r\n\r\nMytilus, or Mussel.--There have been found about twenty species of\r\nthis well-known genus of marine shells in the British strata. They are\r\nsparingly distributed through the several formations, from the Silurian\r\nto the newer Tertiary. One species (_Mytilus Lyellii_, _Wond._ p. 405,\r\nfig. 2) occurs in the Wealden, associated with fresh-water shells.\r\n\r\nOf the genus termed Modiola, which comprises those mussels that have a\r\nrounded anterior termination, nearly forty British species have been\r\ndiscovered; ranging through the fossiliferous strata, from the Silurian\r\nto the Crag. A beautiful species (_Modiola elegans._ _Min. Conch._ tab.\r\n9), with the shell generally retaining its pearly coat, is found in the\r\nLondon Clay, and in the limestone of Bognor.\r\n\r\nAn undescribed striated _Modiola_ (which may be named _M. striata_,\r\nsince the striæ are peculiar), occurs in the Kimmeridge Clay, at\r\nHartwell.\r\n\r\nThose species of Modiola, which excavate hollows in stones, and inhabit\r\nthem, are arranged in a genus termed _Lithodomus_. The occurrence of\r\nthese shells in the remaining erect pillars of the Temple of Jupiter\r\nSerapis (_Wond._ p. 106), at Puzzuoli, has afforded important and\r\nunequivocal evidence of the physical mutations which that part of\r\nItaly has undergone. Two species of Lithodomi have been found, by Mr,\r\nLonsdale, in the Oolite.\r\n\r\n\r\nPholadomya. _Ly._ p. 272, _fig._ 290.--This genus of shells\r\n(established by Mr. James De C. Sowerby in the Min. Conch. 1826),\r\ncomprises about twenty British fossils, all of which, with but two\r\nexceptions, occur in the Lias and Oolite. They are equivalved shells,\r\nwith the posterior end short, and rounded, and the anterior elongated\r\nand gaping. The surface is generally marked with ribs, or alternate\r\nelevations and depressions, diverging obliquely from the beaks to the\r\nmargin. In the clay at Osmington and Radipole, near Weymouth, a large\r\nspecies (_P. æqualis_, _Min. Conch._ tab. 546) is abundant. The Oolite\r\nof Brora, in Scotland, contains several species. The only species found\r\nin our Chalk, is the beautiful shell (_P. decussatum_), figured _Foss.\r\nSouth D._ tab. XXV. _fig._ 3, and first discovered by me, in 1820, in\r\na bed of Chalk Marl, which at that time was exposed at low-water, at\r\nthe base of the cliff at Brighton, near the present entrance to the\r\nChain-pier. The same species has since been found at Clayton, Hamsey,\r\nSouthbourne, and other localities of the Marl.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL PHOLADES.]\r\n\r\nPholas. _Lign. 166, fig. 5, 6._--The common boring bivalve called\r\nPholas, must have attracted the attention of every stroller by the\r\nsea-shore, from the numerous perforations in blocks of chalk, and\r\nother limestones, occasioned by its operations. Some species burrow\r\nin wood, and often commit serious ravages in piles and other submarine\r\nworks constructed of timber. In the earlier ages of our planet we\r\nfind evidence of the existence of the same kind of living instruments\r\nfor the disintegration of floating wood, and the reduction of masses\r\nof rock into detritus. But no traces of these shells have been\r\nfound in strata below the Oolite. One species occurs in the Coral\r\nRag, another in the Kimmeridge Clay; two in the Galt and Greensand;\r\nand three or four in the tertiary deposits. In the Crag, blocks of\r\nstone are occasionally found with the shells of _Pholades_ occupying\r\nthe perforations they originally formed and inhabited. But all the\r\nspecimens I have observed in the Galt, Greensand, and Oolite were\r\n_xylophagous_ (_wood-eating_) species. In the Shanklin Sand, masses of\r\nfossil wood, literally honey-combed by the perforations of Pholades,\r\nare frequent; but the shells themselves are rare. Mr. Sowerby has\r\nfigured a beautiful specimen of silicified wood, from Sandgate, with\r\nnumerous shells of this genus (_Pholas priscus._ _Min. Conch._ tab.\r\n581). _Lign. 166, fig. 5_, represents a fragment of fossil wood, with\r\nthree shells _in situ_; _a_, a shell seen longitudinally; and below,\r\nthe rounded anterior extremities of two other shells are exposed.\r\n\r\nMasses of wood perforated by Pholades, from which all traces of the\r\nshells have disappeared, have given rise to some curious fossil\r\nremains, which are often very enigmatical to the young collector.\r\nIn the Kentish Rag, as for example, in Mr. Bensted's quarry, near\r\nMaidstone, large blocks of stone are found, covered with groups of\r\nsubcylindrical mammillary projections, which are obtuse or rounded\r\nat the apex. In some examples the interstices between these bodies\r\nare free; in others they are occupied by a reddish brown, friable\r\nsubstance, presenting obscure indications of ligneous structure:\r\nand rarely, distinct woody fibres may be observed, the direction of\r\nwhich is transverse, or nearly at right angles, to the mammillated\r\nprojections. These blocks are, in truth, the stony casts of cavities\r\nformed by Pholades, in masses of wood, both the vegetable structure,\r\nand the shells, having perished.\r\n\r\nIn the White Chalk specimens of this kind are occasionally found.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact, relating to some of the specimens from the Iguanodon\r\nquarry, remains to be mentioned. Upon breaking off the projections,\r\nto ascertain if any traces of the shells of the Pholades remained,\r\nwe discovered in several, near the apex, a univalve shell, a species\r\nof _Nerita_. _Lign. 166, fig. 6_, represents a fragment of stone\r\nwith two of the casts, which have been broken, and in each, at _a_, a\r\nunivalve is imbedded. At _b_, the ligneous structure of the original\r\nwood is visible. The only hypothesis that will account for the\r\nappearance of these univalves in their present position, is that of\r\nsupposing that the Nerites crawled into the cavities made in the mass\r\nof timber, after the shells of the Pholades had been removed; and that\r\nthe wood became imbedded in a sand-bank, and the univalves enclosed in\r\nthe cavities; the ligneous structure in a great measure perished, and\r\nthe stony casts of the perforations of the borers, with the imprisoned\r\nunivalves, remained. The Nerites, as shown in the example figured,\r\ndo not occupy any particular position in the tubes; one has the apex\r\ntowards the end of the cavity, and the other lies in a transverse\r\ndirection.[368]\r\n\r\n[368] In a fragment of a perforated column, from Puzzuoli, in my\r\npossession, by favour of Sir Woodbine Parish, there were numerous\r\nliving univalves in the cavities made and previously inhabited by the\r\nlithodomi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEREDO.]\r\n\r\nTeredo. _Ly._ p. 24.--It will be convenient to notice in this place\r\nanother genus of boring shells, whose fossil remains are far more\r\nabundant than those of the Pholas. The _Teredo navalis_, or Ship-worm,\r\nwhich is the most vermiform of all the mollusca, forms tortuous\r\ncylindrical hollows in wood; and in some climates commits the most\r\nextensive injuries to ships, the piles of harbours, bridges, and other\r\nsubmarine works formed of timber. A reference to the illustration given\r\nby Sir C. Lyell will render detailed description unnecessary. The\r\n_Teredo_ is furnished at one extremity with testaceous valves, by which\r\nit bores its way into the wood, while from the surface of its soft body\r\na calcareous matter is secreted, which lines with a shelly covering\r\nthe hollows or channels formed by the animal in its progress. The\r\nfossil species differ from the recent in the valves being united to the\r\ncalcareous tube. Wood perforated by _Teredines_, and occupied by their\r\nshelly tubes, occurs in almost every locality of the London Clay. Those\r\nspecimens in which the wood is petrified, and the cavities of the tubes\r\nare filled with calcareous spar of various colours, furnish beautiful\r\nsections, when cut and polished (_Pict. Atlas_, pl. viii. _fig._ 8,\r\n9). When the canal in the Regent's Park was being formed, large blocks\r\nof perforated calcareous wood were discovered, having the ligneous\r\nstructure well preserved, and the tubes of the Teredines occupied by\r\nyellow, grey, and brown spar, forming specimens of great beauty and\r\ninterest. Wood, with Teredines, or some analogous boring mollusks,\r\noccurs sparingly in the chalk of this country; but in the cretaceous\r\nstrata at Maestricht, large masses are frequently found.[369] Fossil\r\nwood may occasionally be observed with perforations that have been made\r\nby other kinds of boring shells; but the preceding remarks will suffice\r\nto convey an idea of the nature and origin of such appearances.[370]\r\n\r\n[369] In the British Museum there is a mass of silicified wood from the\r\nUpper Greensand of Blackdown, perforated by a Teredo, whose valves\r\nremain in the burrows.\r\n\r\n[370] Other genera of boring shells also occur fossil, as Fistulana,\r\nGastrochæna (_Min. Conch._ tab. 526), Saxicava (_Min. Conch._ tab.\r\n466).\r\n\r\nTrigonia. _Lign. 127, fig. 1, 2, 4._--These bivalves are related to\r\nthe _Arcadeæ_ and _Nuculæ_, but distinguished by the peculiar character\r\nof the hinge; the right valve has two large oblong teeth, which\r\ndiverge from the umbo, and are strongly furrowed, and fit into two\r\ncorresponding grooved cavities, in the opposite, or left valve. These\r\nshells are very thick and nacreous; they abound in certain strata of\r\nthe Oolite and lower Cretaceous formation, but have not been observed\r\nin any deposits of this country older than the Lias; there are nearly\r\nthirty British species. Two living species of Trigonia (_Trigonia\r\nmargaritacea_ and _T. Jukesii_) are known, both inhabitants of the\r\nseas of New Holland, where they are associated with Terebratulæ. Some\r\nof the argillaceous beds of the Oolite, as the Oxford and Kimmeridge\r\nclays, abound in Trigoniæ; Osmington and Radipole, near Weymouth, are\r\ncelebrated localities for these fossil shells, which are found there\r\nin great perfection; and on the French coast, where similar strata\r\nappear, the Trigoniæ are equally abundant. Under the cliffs, near\r\nBoulogne harbour, the shore is strewn with them. Three common species\r\nare figured in _Lign. 127_. The casts of most of the species are\r\nsmooth, as in _fig. 2_; and the collector should, therefore, search\r\nfor impressions of the outer surface, when the shell is absent, as is\r\ngenerally the case in the Portland Oolite and Shanklin Sand, in which\r\nTrigoniæ are very numerous. Near Highworth, in Wiltshire, very fine and\r\nlarge examples of _Trigonia costata_, _fig. 4_, occur, with the shell\r\npreserved. The impressions of the large, oblong, diverging teeth of the\r\nhinge, are usually so strongly marked in the casts, as to render it\r\neasy to identify the shells of this genus. The quarries of the Portland\r\nOolite at Swindon, Wilts, teem with casts of Trigoniæ, collocated with\r\nAmmonites. In the Isle of Portland they are also very numerous, some\r\nbeds of stone being so friable, from the numerous cavities left by the\r\nremoval of the substance of the shells, as to be unfit for paving,\r\nor other economical purposes. Very sharp casts may be obtained from\r\nthis rock by merely breaking the stone to pieces. In the Whetstone\r\nof Blackdown, Devon, beautiful silicified Trigoniæ are occasionally\r\nfound. Tisbury, in Wiltshire, yields very fine specimens, and in some\r\nexamples, Mr. G. B. Sowerby has detected remains of the ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL FRESH-WATER BIVALVES.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FRESH-WATER BIVALVES.]\r\n\r\nThe animals of the shells hitherto described are, with scarcely any\r\nexception, inhabitants of the sea; and the marine origin of the strata\r\nin which they occur, may consequently be inferred, with but little\r\nprobability of error. I now propose noticing the fossil remains of\r\nthose bivalves which inhabit rivers, lakes, streams, and pools of\r\nfresh water. The marine, or fresh-water, character of fossil shells,\r\nis inferred from their resemblance to the recent mollusca, whose\r\nhabits are known; for the shells alone present no unequivocal marks,\r\nby which even the experienced conchologist can pronounce whether an\r\nextinct form belonged to a marine or to a fluviatile mollusk, although\r\ncertain characters may admit of an approximative inference. Thus, for\r\ninstance, as none of the known living fresh-water bivalves belong to\r\nthe previous division, the _Monomyaria_, the presence in a stratum of\r\nnumerous shells with but one muscular impression, would afford a fair\r\npresumption of the marine origin of such, deposit. The remains with\r\nwhich the shells are associated and the mineralogical characters of\r\nthe strata in which they occur, would, of course, afford important\r\ncorroborative evidence.[371]\r\n\r\n[371] See Sir C. Lyell on the distinction between fresh-water and marine\r\ndeposits. _Ly._ p. 27, _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe living fresh-water bivalves comprise but a few genera and species;\r\nand those which have been found fossil in the British strata belong to\r\nbut four or five genera. Their distribution is restricted to strata\r\nof undoubted fluviatile origin, and to those local intercalations of\r\nfresh-water and land productions in marine deposits, which occur in\r\nsome of the secondary, and in many of the tertiary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnio. _Ly._ p. 28.--The river Mussels, or _Unionidæ_, have a solid,\r\npearly shell, with two principal and two lateral teeth on the hinge;\r\nand their umbones, or bosses, are generally smooth, or longitudinally\r\nundulated. Those which have no cardinal teeth are arranged under the\r\ngenus _Anodon_: but it is not necessary for our present purpose, to\r\nenter into minute conchological distinctions. In number, variety, and\r\nbeauty, the species which inhabit the large rivers of North America\r\npresent a striking contrast with the few and homely British fresh-water\r\nmussels; nor have we, in a fossil state, any shells of this family\r\nat all comparable with those living types.[372] The earliest fossil\r\nMollusca referred to the genus _Unio_ appear in certain layers of\r\nclay and argillaceous ironstone belonging to the Carboniferous system\r\nof Derbyshire, Coalbrook Dale, &c. (_Min. Conch._ vol. i. tab. 33).\r\nIn the former county, these strata are termed _mussel-band_;[373] and\r\nsome beds constitute a compact shell-limestone, which admits of being\r\nmanufactured into vases, &c., and takes a good polish; the sections\r\nof the shells in this marble are white, on a dark ground. There is,\r\nhowever, considerable doubt whether any of the Carboniferous shells\r\nreally belong to the genus _Unio_; some geologists refer them to\r\n_Cardinia_, a group of sea-shells found especially in the Lias.\r\n\r\n[372] See American Journal of Science, vol. xlvii. p. 402, \"Unionidæ.\"\r\n\r\n[373] \"A solid stratum of ironstone, which extends from Tupton Moor to\r\nStaveley.\" Martin's Petrificata Derbiensia, pl. xxvii.\r\n\r\nThe earliest undoubted shells of this genus from the British strata,\r\nare, I believe, those first discovered by me in the strata of Tilgate\r\nForest, (_Foss. South D._ p. 45, and _Foss. Tilg. For._ p. 57), and\r\nsubsequently found in numerous localities of the Wealden.[374]\r\n\r\n[374] They are figured in Geol. S. E. p. 250; and in Dr. Fitton's\r\nMemoir, Geol. Trans, vol. iv. pl. 21.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 131. Unio Valdensis. (1/3 _nat._)\r\n\r\n_Wealden; Isle of Wight._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1844 I discovered a large species in the Wealden at Brook Point.\r\nI have named it _Unio Valdensis_.[375] I have collected and obtained\r\nnearly fifty specimens; they present two varieties, the one contracted\r\nand narrow, the other broader and deeper; this difference is probably\r\nsexual; the wide and deep shells may be the females; for in the living\r\nAmerican Uniones the same characters are observed. Some examples are\r\nremarkably well preserved; the ligament remaining in a carbonized\r\nstate, and the body of the mollusk in the condition of molluskite; even\r\na tint of the original tawny reddish colour of the shell is present.\r\nThe same species has been found in the Wealden strata, near Tunbridge\r\nWells, by Mr. Barlow, C. E.\r\n\r\n[375] _Unio Valdensis_ resembles in form the Mexican species, U.\r\nPanacöensis (River Panaco), but is probably more nearly allied to\r\nan unnamed Australian species of which Mr. G, Sowerby has numerous\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nI shall reserve my remarks upon the important aid these fossils\r\nafforded in the determination of the fluviatile origin of the Wealden,\r\nfor our _Excursion to Tilgate Forest_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 132. Cyclas and Melanopsis. _Wealden; Sussex._]\r\n\r\n\r\nCyclas. _Wond._ p. 404. _Ly._ p. 28.--Another genus of fresh-water\r\nbivalves is termed _Cyclas_, of which there are ten species in the\r\nWealden formation: and, with the exception of four or five recent\r\nforms, which occur in the tertiary fresh-water strata, none others\r\nhave been found in England.[376] The shells of the genus Cyclas are\r\noval, transverse, equivalved bivalves, with the hinge-teeth very\r\nsmall: the substance of the shell is thin and fragile; the figures in\r\n_Wond._ and _Ly._ accurately represent the appearance of the fossil\r\n_Cyclades_ of the Wealden, and tertiary strata. Entire layers of two\r\nor three species of these shells occur in the argillaceous deposits of\r\nthe Wealden, generally in a friable state, but from among the masses\r\nof crushed shells, perfect specimens may be obtained, and sometimes\r\nwith the remains of the epidermis and ligament. The hard stone, termed\r\ncalciferous grit, in the neighbourhood of Hastings, Tilgate Forest,\r\nHorsham, and other places in the Weald of Sussex, abounds in casts of\r\nthe same species, associated with the _Uniones_, previously described.\r\nIn the cliffs on the southern shores of the Isle of Wight where the\r\nWealden beds emerge, and also in the Isle of Purbeck, these shells are\r\nequally abundant. Together with the _Uniones_, they occasionally appear\r\nin the limestone, called Sussex Marble; and in the Isle of Purbeck\r\nthere are beds of limestone wholly composed of bivalves belonging to\r\nthese two genera, and presenting, in polished slabs, markings formed by\r\nsections of the enclosed shells.\r\n\r\n[376] _Cyrena_, is a genus so nearly related to Cyclas, that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish them, and it will be convenient to retain only\r\nthe former name.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL PTEROPODA.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PTEROPODA. GASTEROPODA.]\r\n\r\nIn the Ludlow strata there are found small fragile elongated conical\r\nshells without chambers, which are supposed by Professor E. Forbes to\r\nbe identical with a recent genus of pteropodous mollusca, common in the\r\nMediterranean, called Creseis. They seldom exceed two inches in length.\r\n\r\nOf another genus, named Conularia, six Species have been discovered in\r\nthe Silurian formation.[377]\r\n\r\n[377] See Geol.

Their shells are for the most part formed of\r\none valve, hence the name of _univalve_; but in some species it is\r\ncomposed of several pieces. The most simple form of shell is that of\r\nthe hollow cone, of which the _Patella_, or limpet, affords an example;\r\nand in the more complicated modifications, the cone is twisted, or\r\nconvoluted spirally, either in the same plane as in the _Planorbis_\r\nof our rivers, or obliquely, as in by far the greater number of\r\nspecies. The direction of the spire is generally from left to right,\r\nthe aperture being dextral to the observer when the shell is placed\r\nwith its apex uppermost, as in _Lign. 133, figs. 1, 2, 3_; but in a\r\nfew species the spire turns in the opposite manner, and the mouth or\r\naperture is to the left, or sinistral, as in _Lign. 133, fig. 4_.\r\nIn consequence of the form of the aperture of the shell, the entire\r\nor notched condition of its margin, and the presence or absence of a\r\ncanal or siphon always having relation to the soft parts of the animal,\r\nthese characters afford data by which the genera and species of the\r\nshells may be determined, and information obtained as to the structure\r\nand economy of the originals.\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropoda generally creep by means of a fleshy disk, or foot,\r\nwhich is situated under the belly. Some kinds are terrestrial, others\r\ninhabit trees, many live in rivers and streams, others in stagnant and\r\nbrackish waters; but the greater number are denizens of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL GASTEROPODA.]\r\n\r\nThe Common Snail, River Snail, and Periwinkle, are instances of\r\nterrestrial, fluviatile, and marine forms. The organs of respiration\r\nare situated in the last whorl of the shell; and in some genera\r\nthe border of the mantle, or integument surrounding the body, is\r\nprolonged into a siphon, by which the water is freely admitted,\r\nwithout the head or foot being protruded: in these mollusks the shell\r\nhas a corresponding channel to receive the siphon, as in the Whelk,\r\nor Buccinum, and in the fossil shell _Lign. 133, fig. 4_. The\r\nGasteropoda are generally provided with an operculum, or movable valve,\r\nby which the aperture is closed and defended when the animal retreats\r\nwithin its shell. In some species the operculum is a mere horny\r\npellicle; in others it is a solid calcareous plate of considerable\r\nrelative thickness. These mollusca, as is but too well known of the\r\nterrestrial species, consume large quantities of food. Some are\r\nherbivorous, and others carnivorous; many prey on living, and others\r\non decaying animal and vegetable substances.[378] As in a fossil state\r\nthe shells alone remain to afford any clue as to the structure and\r\neconomy of the originals, characters have been sought for, by which\r\nthe fluviatile or marine nature, and the carnivorous or herbivorous\r\nhabits of the living mollusca may be determined. As a general rule,\r\nit will be found, that the shells of terrestrial and fresh-water\r\nGasteropoda have the aperture entire, as in the Garden Snail, and in\r\nthe fossil shell, _Lign. 133, fig. 1_; and that a large proportion\r\nof the marine species have the opening notched or channelled, as in\r\nthe Whelk, and _Lign. 133, figs. 3, 4_; and most of the species with\r\nentire apertures are herbivorous. But these inferences must be regarded\r\nin a very general sense, and it will require corroborative evidence to\r\nestablish the marine or fresh-water nature of those fossil shells which\r\ndo not bear a close analogy to known living species.[379]\r\n\r\n[378] \"All _Gasteropoda_ commence life under the same form, both of\r\nshell and animal, namely, a very simple helicoid shell, and an animal\r\nfurnished with two ciliated wings or lobes, by which it can swim freely\r\nthrough the fluid in which it is contained. At this stage of existence\r\nthe animal corresponds to the permanent state of the _Pteropod_, and\r\nthe form is alike, whether it be afterwards a shelled or a shell-less\r\nspecies.\"--Prof. E. Forbes, Edin. Philos. Journal, vol. xxxvi. p. 326.\r\n\r\nThe well known Tiger Cowry (_Cyprcea tigris_) in its earliest stage has\r\na minute helicoid (snail-like) shell.\r\n\r\n[379] See _Ly._ p. 30.\r\n\r\nThe various conditions in which the remains of univalve shells occur in\r\nthe mineral kingdom have already been so fully explained, that but a\r\nfew additional remarks on that subject are required (see p. 382).\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropoda are found to progressively diminish in number with\r\nthe antiquity of the deposits, and it was once supposed that this\r\ntype of molluscous organization was not contemporaneous with the\r\nancient Cephalopoda. My discovery of several genera associated with\r\nAmmonites in the chalk (see _Foss. South D._ pl. xviii, xix) first\r\ntended to invalidate this hypothesis; and the subsequent researches\r\nof Dr. Fitton, Professor Phillips, and other geologists have shown\r\nthat the presence or absence of Gasteropoda in a stratum may generally\r\nbe ascribed to the circumstance of the deposit having been formed\r\nin shallow, or in deep water. Thus when simple univalves largely\r\npredominate under circumstances that indicate they were imbedded in\r\ntheir native habitats, it may be safely concluded that the rock is of\r\nlittoral formation; or, in other words, was deposited in shallow water,\r\nnear the sea-shore; and, on the contrary, when Nautili, Ammonites,\r\nand the shells of other mollusca known to live in deep waters abound\r\nin a formation, it may be presumed that the strata were formed in the\r\ntranquil depths of the ocean. The number of described species from\r\nthe British strata is nearly eight hundred; and these are distributed\r\nthroughout the sedimentary formations, from the Silurian to the newest\r\nTertiary; the latter containing by far the greater proportion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL FRESH-WATER UNIVALVES.]\r\n\r\nFresh-water Univalves.--The fossil shells of Gasteropoda that are\r\nundoubtedly fluviatile, comprise but few genera and species, and are\r\nconfined to those deposits, which, from the corroborative proofs\r\nafforded by other organic remains, are unquestionably of fresh-water\r\norigin. Such are the intercalated beds of clay and limestone in the\r\nLondon and Paris basins, the Wealden formation, and certain strata in\r\nthe Carboniferous system. The most numerous specimens are principally\r\nreferable to the common fluviatile genera, _Paludina_, _Limnæa_,\r\n_Planorbis_, and _Melanopsis_ (see _Ly._ p. 29).\r\n\r\nPaludina. _Lign. 133, fig. 1._ (_Wond._ p. 401, _Ly._ p. 29.)--This\r\ncommon river shell is of a conoidal form, and the whorls of the spire,\r\nand the aperture, are rounded. Eleven British species are known. In\r\nthe tertiary fresh-water beds of Headon Hill, at Alum Bay, Paludinæ\r\nwith the shells perfect, and of a dull white colour, are abundant;\r\nand also in the limestone at Shalcombe, in the Isle of Wight, in the\r\nstate of casts. In both these localities the Paludinæ are associated\r\nwith other fresh-water shells. But the grand deposit of shells of\r\nthis genus is the Wealden formation; throughout which there are\r\nextensive beds of marble, coarse limestone, and clays, almost wholly\r\ncomposed of Paludinæ, and minute fresh-water Crustaceans, of the\r\ngenus _Cypris_, which will be described in a subsequent chapter. The\r\ncompact paludina-limestone of Sussex, called Petworth or Sussex marble,\r\nis principally made up of one species, the _P. fluviorum_, _Lign.\r\n133, fig. 1_, and is an aggregation of Paludinæ, held together by\r\ncrystallized carbonate of lime; the cavities of the shells, and their\r\ninterstices, being often filled with white calcareous spar. A polished\r\nslab, displaying sections of the enclosed shells, is figured in _Wond._\r\np. 402. Upon examining slices of this marble with the microscope, the\r\ncavities of the shells are found to contain myriads of the cases of\r\nCyprides.[380] The Wealden limestone of the Isle of Purbeck, _Lign.\r\n134_, known as Purbeck marble, is, in like manner, composed of Paludinæ,\r\nbut of a much smaller species. Both these marbles were in great\r\nrepute with the architects of the middle ages, and there are but few\r\nof our cathedrals and ancient churches which do not still contain\r\nexamples, either in their columns, monuments, or pavements, of one or\r\nboth varieties. The polished marble columns of Chichester Cathedral,\r\nand those of the Temple Church, in London, are of Purbeck marble; in\r\nother words, they are composed of the petrified shells of snails, that\r\nlived and died in a river, flowing through a country inhabited by the\r\nIguanodon and other colossal reptiles, all of which have long since\r\nbecome extinct. With the exception of the _mussel-band_ limestone of\r\nthe Carboniferous system, previously described, these are the only\r\nBritish fresh-water marbles[381] There are four species of Paludina in\r\nthe Wealden, and four in the Tertiary strata of Hants.\r\n\r\n[380] For a particular account of this marble, see Geol. S. E. pp.\r\n182-187.\r\n\r\n[381] The collector may obtain specimens, and polished slabs of these\r\nlimestones, of Mr. Martin, mason, Lewes, Sussex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 134.\r\n\r\nPolished Slab of Purbeck Marble.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLimnæa. _Lign. 133, fig. 2._--Several species of these fresh-water\r\nmollusks inhabit our lakes and ponds, and may be known by their pointed\r\nspire, elongated oval body, and delicate thin shell: on the inner lip\r\nof the aperture there is an oblique fold. Fossil shells of this genus\r\nare found with Paludinæ in the fresh-water tertiary deposits. Headon\r\nHill and other localities in the Isle of Wight abound in these shells;\r\nand in the limestone of Calbourn beautiful casts are very numerous.\r\nThe Paris basin yields several species; and there are six species in\r\nthe Isle of Wight Tertiary; I have not observed any decided examples\r\nin the Wealden. In the sands and clays the shells are well preserved;\r\nin the limestones the casts only remain. Shells of another genus of\r\nfresh-water spiral univalves, termed _Bulimus_ (_Ly._ p. 30), are found\r\nassociated with the above. A large species (_B. ellipticus_, _Min.\r\nConch._ tab. 337), occurs in the limestone at Binstead, near Ryde,\r\nand at Calbourn; I have collected specimens two inches long from the\r\nformer locality; they are generally in the state of casts, with a white\r\nfriable coating of the shell.[382]\r\n\r\n[382] A very large species of _Limnæa_ from Bavaria (labelled _L.\r\nmaxima_) is in the British Museum. It is a cast six and a half inches\r\nlong, and is placed with the recent shells. Prof. E. Forbes has\r\ndiscovered a Limneïd (_Physa_) in the Purbeck strata.\r\n\r\nPlanorbis. _Ly._ p. 29. _Wond._ p. 400.--The shells of this genus\r\nare also numerous in our rivers and lakes, and may be distinguished\r\nby their discoidal form, the shell being coiled up in a nearly\r\nvertical plane. There are about twenty living species; and sixteen are\r\nenumerated as fossil in the British tertiary; five occur in the Isle\r\nof Wight basin, in the localities of the fresh-water genera already\r\nmentioned; Headon Hill, in particular, yields shells of this genus in\r\ngreat abundance and perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelanopsis. _Ly._ p. 29.--These are spiral univalves, the appearance\r\nof which will be better understood by the figures, than by any\r\ndescription. I allude to this genus because a small species is very\r\nnumerous, with the other fresh-water shells, at Headon Hill; and two or\r\nmore species are found in the argillaceous strata of the Wealden (see\r\n_Geol. S. E._ p. 249, and _Lign. 132_).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL MARINE UNIVALVES.]\r\n\r\nMarine Univalves.--Of the fossil marine Gasteropoda there are no less\r\nthan eighty genera in the strata of the British Islands, and the\r\nspecies amount to several hundreds. To distinguish the species and\r\ngenera, reference must, of course, be made to works expressly devoted\r\nto fossil conchology, as Sowerby's _Mineral Conchology_, and _Genera\r\nof Fossil Shells_; or to the works of French authors, particularly\r\nthose of Lamarck, edited by M. Deshayes, and of M. Blainville. The\r\n_Penny Cyclopedia_ contains admirable notices of fossil shells, under\r\nthe respective heads of the classes, orders, and genera, of the recent\r\nMollusca.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuccinum, of which the common Whelk is an example.--Fusus, _Lign.\r\n133, fig. 4_. _Wond._ p. 244.--Pleurotoma, _Ly._ p. 31. _Wond._ p.\r\n244.--Cerithium, _Lign. 133, fig. 3_. _Wond._ p. 244.--Ancilla,\r\n_Wond._ p. 244. _Ly._ p. 31.--Voluta, _Ly._ p. 202, _fig._ 180.--Murex,\r\n_Ly._ p. 164.--Rostellaria, _Ly._ p. 201.--To the eight genera here\r\nenumerated a very large number of the marine simple univalve shells\r\nbelong; and they are principally found in Tertiary strata.\r\n\r\nThe animals of these shells are characterized by their respiratory\r\norgans, which are formed of one or two pectiniform gills, with a tube\r\nor siphon more or less elongated, for the free admission of sea-water\r\nto the branchial apparatus. This organization is indicated in the\r\nshell, either by a notch, or by a prolonged tubular canal. All the\r\nspecies are, with scarcely any exceptions, inhabitants of the sea, and\r\ncarnivorous.\r\n\r\nI have selected for illustration of the genus _Fusus_, a celebrated\r\nshell of the Crag, known among collectors as the \"_Esssex reversed\r\nWhelk_,\" _Lign. 133, fig. 4_; the spire is twisted in the opposite\r\ndirection to the usual mode, and the mouth is consequently to the left\r\nof the observer; the same species occurs with the spire in the common\r\ndirection. The shells of the genus _Pleurotoma_ are distinguished by an\r\nincision, or notch, in the side of the right or outer lip; and those\r\nof _Cerithium_, by the form of the mouth, see _Lign. 133, fig. 3_.\r\nThe latter is a very numerous genus, and more than two hundred\r\nfossil species are enumerated; it contains many elegant forms. The\r\nTertiary strata at Grignon are particularly rich in these fossils;\r\nthe shells are of a pearly whiteness, and as perfect as when recent.\r\nSome Cerithia are of considerable size; the _C. giganteum_ is from ten\r\nto fourteen inches in length. The genus Potamides comprehends shells\r\nclosely resembling the Cerithia in form, but which are inhabitants of\r\nfresh-water.[383] This is an instance of the difficulty which sometimes\r\nexists of arriving at certain conclusions as to the habits of the\r\nmollusks, from their testaceous coverings alone.\r\n\r\n[383] Mr. Woodward informs me that they can only be distinguished when\r\n_fossil_, by the absence of _varices_, or \"periodic mouths.\" The recent\r\nspecies are known to be inhabitants of fresh-water, by their dark\r\nepidermis, corroded points, and horny multi-spiral _opercula_.\r\n\r\nThe Plastic Clay beds at Castle Hill, Newhaven, and in the vicinity\r\nof Woolwich, abound in two species of shells, which were originally\r\ndescribed by Mr. Sowerby, as _Cerithia_ (viz. _C. funatum_ and _C.\r\nmelanoides_),[384] but are now referred to the fresh-water genus,\r\nMelania; by some conchologists to _Potamides_. At Castle Hill they\r\nare accompanied by fresh-water bivalves, and leaves of dicotyledonous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n[384] Foss. South Downs, tab. xvii. figs. 3, 4.\r\n\r\nOf the genus _Rostellaria_, there is a remarkable species in the London\r\nClay, called _R. macroptera_, from the large wing-like expansion of its\r\nouter lip, in adult specimens; see _Ly._ p. 201. An elegant Rostellaria\r\nis found in the Galt, at Folkstone,[385] (_Foss. South D._ tab. xix.\r\nfigs. 12, 14,) and other localities; and also in the Chalk Marl.\r\n\r\n[385] \"This shell belongs to the recent genus, _Aporrhaïs_, and is\r\nrelated to Cerithium, not to Strombus.\"--_Mr. Woodward._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCasts of a large ventricose, globular univalve, called Dolium,[NV]\r\nhave been found in the Chalk Marl, at Clayton, near Hurstpierpoint, in\r\nSussex. This species is distinguished by its transverse tuberculated\r\nbands; it is a very rare production of the lower chalk of Sussex\r\n(_Min. Conch._ tab. 326). Turbinated shells related to _Trochus_, and\r\nbelonging to several genera, occur in the Cretaceous deposits. As is\r\nthe case generally with the univalves of this formation, but slight\r\ntraces of the shells remain; the thin internal nacreous lining is\r\nsometimes found adhering to the cast.\r\n\r\n[386] This Chalk fossil is not a _Dolium_: it is probably related to\r\n_Ringinella incrassata_ (Geol. Suss. t. xix. _fig._ 3), one of the\r\n_Tornatellidæ_, a family largely developed in the chalk.\r\n\r\nIn the Chalk of Touraine, species of the genera _Conus_ (_Lign. 135,\r\nfig. 1_) and _Solarium_ (_Lign. 135, fig. 2_) are found with the\r\nshells preserved. The specimens figured, _Lign. 135_, are selected to\r\nfamiliarize the student with the difference so commonly observable,\r\nbetween the outer surface of the casts, and that of the shells: in\r\nboth these fossils the shells are marked externally with lines and\r\ntubercles; but the casts present only the smooth surface of the\r\ninterior of the shell in which they were moulded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 135.

Professor Phillips enumerates more than ninety in\r\nthe mountain limestone of Yorkshire (_Phil. York._), belonging to the\r\ngenera _Turbo_, _Pleurotomaria_, _Natica_, _Euomphalus_, _Loxonema_,\r\n_Macrocheilus_, _Platyceras_, and _Metoptoma_. Thirty-four species from\r\nthe Silurian rocks are figured and described in _Murch. Sil. Syst._ p.\r\n706.\r\n\r\nThe _Natica_, _Lign. 136, fig. 3_, sometimes attains thrice the size\r\nrepresented, and has been found in many localities in England and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleurotomaria. _Lign. 136, fig. 4._--This is an extinct genus,\r\ndistinguished from Trochus by a fissure on the right lip, the position\r\nof which is indicated by the band along the back of the whorl in\r\n_Lign. 136_; several species occur in the Mountain Limestone; the\r\nmarkings of the original shell are sometimes preserved, as in the\r\nexample delineated This genus is common in the Oolite; a splendid\r\nspecies, with the shell entire, is found in the Kimmeridge Clay, at\r\nHartwell; limestone casts of the same species are abundant in the\r\nPortland stone at Swindon, in Wiltshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 136.

South D._\r\ntab. xviii., under the names of _Cirrus perspectivus_, and _Trochus\r\nlinearis_. The Chalk Marl of Sussex yields in some localities (Hamsey,\r\nMiddleham, Clayton) fine casts of Pleurotomaria, which appear to be\r\ndistinct from those of the upper cretaceous strata.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EUOMPHALUS.]\r\n\r\nEuomphalus.[387] _Lign. 136, figs. 1, 2._--The shells of this extinct\r\ngenus are deeply umbilicated, discoidal, spiral univalves, having the\r\ninnermost whorls of the shell divided by imperforated partitions. The\r\ninternal structure of these shells will serve to prepare the student\r\nfor those more complicated forms of the testaceous apparatus presented\r\nby the Cephalopoda, which will form the subject of the next chapter.\r\nThere are several recent univalves the animals of which retreat in the\r\nprogress of growth from the apex of the spire, and the vacated portion\r\nis shut off by a shelly plate. In some genera a series of concave septa\r\nare thus formed; but in others (as _Magilus_) the deserted cavity\r\nis filled by a compact accretion of calcareous matter, and a solid\r\nelongated shell is produced. The _Euomphalus_, of which there are many\r\nspecies in the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata, belongs\r\nto the former group. As the animal increased in size, it deserted the\r\nsmaller and innermost portion of the spire, and a nacreous partition\r\nwas secreted by the posterior part of the mantle, the interspace\r\nremaining hollow; as this process was repeated at different periods,\r\nseveral cells were successively formed. This chambered structure is\r\nshown in the specimen _Lign. 136, fig. 2_, in which the cells are\r\nfilled with spar, but the outer cavity is occupied by limestone like\r\nthat in which the shell was imbedded; a proof that no communication\r\nexisted between the chamber occupied by the body of the animal, and\r\nthe space from which it had withdrawn. The calcareous spar, as in\r\nthe vegetable remains previously described (p. 71), has percolated\r\nthe substance of the fossil, and crystallized in the innermost\r\ncells. We shall again have occasion to refer to this interesting\r\nfact, when investigating the chambered cells of the Cephalopoda. It\r\nmay be necessary to remark, that it does not appear that the vacant\r\ninterspaces in the Euomphalus served the special purpose of the\r\nair-chambers of the Nautilus and Ammonite.\r\n\r\n[387] So named by Mr. Sowerby, in allusion to the deeply umbilicated\r\ncharacter of the disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 137.\r\n\r\nMurchisonia angulata.\r\n\r\n_Devonian; Eifel_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMurchisonia. _Lign. 137._ An elongated spiral shell, having the outer\r\nlip deeply notched, as in the Pleurotomaria (_a, Lign. 137_). There\r\nare upwards of 50 species of this genus, which are characteristic of\r\nthe palæozoic rocks. They occur in the Permian, Devonian, and Lower\r\nSilurian deposits; the specimen figured is from the Devonian, or Old\r\nRed of the Eifel.\r\n\r\n\r\nChiton. Valves of Chitons have been found in the Magnesian limestone,\r\nnear Sunderland, by Prof. King, (_Permian Fossils_, _Pal. Soc._ p. 202,\r\npl. xvi.), and in the Silurian rocks of Ireland, by Mr. Salter, _Geol.\r\nJournal_, vol. iii. p. 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SPHÆRULITES.]\r\n\r\nSphærulites.[388] _Lign. 138._--No vestiges of a shell of this genus\r\nhad been noticed in the English strata, until my discovery of some\r\nfragments in the Lewes Chalk in 1820; from the lamellated structure of\r\nthese fossils, I mistook them for corals, until specimens were obtained\r\nsufficiently perfect to show the form of the originals; these were\r\ndescribed in the _Geol. S. E._ (p. 130), under the name of Hippurites.\r\nBut these fossils are more nearly related to the _Sphærulites_, which\r\ndiffer from the shells of the former genus in having only one internal\r\nlongitudinal ridge, and in the external surface being roughened by\r\nirregularly raised plates, as in _Lign. 138, fig. 1_, which is a\r\nspecimen from the Pyrenees, collected by M. Alex. Brongniart; the\r\noperculum is seen at _a_.\r\n\r\n[388] This genus has been referred by some conchologists to the\r\nBivalves, and by others to the Univalves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 138.

Some beautiful specimens collected by the late Mr.\r\nDixon from the Chalk, near Worthing, are now in the British Museum.[390]\r\nThe structure of the Sphærulite is accurately delineated in _Lign.\r\n138, figs. 2a 2b_. The cavities of these shells are occasionally\r\nfilled with flint, but in general with chalk, which may be entirely\r\ncleared away, as in _fig. 2_. The Hippurites of the limestone of the\r\nPyrenees are frequently occupied by calcareous spar, and the substance\r\nof the shells is occasionally transmuted into the same mineral.\r\n\r\n[390] Petrifactions, p. 468.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOLLUSKITE.]\r\n\r\nMolluskite; or the carbonized remains of the soft parts of\r\nmollusca.--Before proceeding to the consideration of that numerous and\r\nimportant division of the mollusca the _Cephalopoda_, I will offer a\r\nfew remarks on a carbonaceous substance resulting from the gelatinous\r\nmatter of which the soft bodies of these animals are composed, and for\r\nwhich I have proposed the name of _molluskite_, to indicate its nature\r\nand origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 139. Coprolites and Molluskite. _Chalk and\r\nGreensand._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Coprolite of a fish (_Macropoma_). _Chalk, Lewes._\r\n\r\n       2.--Coprolite of a fish (_Squalus_). _Chalk marl.

(_Mr. Bensted._) _Kentish Rag,\r\n             Maidstone._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis substance is of a dark brown or black colour, and occurs either\r\nin shapeless masses, which are irregularly distributed among the\r\nshells and other organic remains, in sandstone, limestone, &c., or\r\nas casts of shells, or occupying their cavities, as in the specimen\r\n_Lign. 139, fig. 3_, which is a vertical section of a spiral univalve\r\n(_Rostellaria_), filled with the soft parts of the animal, converted\r\ninto molluskite. Upon analysis this substance is found to contain\r\na large proportion of animal carbon.[391] The rocks of firestone at\r\nSouthbourne, on the Sussex coast, are mottled with brown molluskite\r\nand hard amorphous concretions, consisting of carbon and phosphate of\r\nlime, mixed with sand and other extraneous matter. Casts of shells,\r\nof the genera Venus, _Arca_, &c., entirely composed of the same kind\r\nof materials, are also abundant in those rocks. The lowermost bed of\r\nGalt, at its line of junction with the Greensand beneath, at Folkstone,\r\nand in many other localities, is largely composed of similar matter,\r\nresembling in appearance the fossils called Coprolites, hereafter\r\ndescribed. The outer chamber of the Ammonites and other shells, so\r\nabundant in the Galt, are often filled with this substance. But the\r\nmost interesting deposit of molluskite is in the Kentish Rag of Mr.\r\nBensted's quarry, near Maidstone. This phenomenon had not escaped\r\nthe notice of that intelligent and accurate observer, who liberally\r\nplaced at my disposal numerous shells, particularly of _Trigoniæ_ and\r\n_Terebratulæ_, which were filled with molluskite, and large slabs of\r\nthe sandstone, full of concretionary and amorphous masses of the same.\r\nThe latter, Mr. Bensted suggested, may have been derived from the soft\r\nbodies of the dead Mollusks, which, having become disengaged from their\r\nshells and aggregated together, had floated in the sea, until they\r\nbecame enveloped in the sand and mud, which have gradually consolidated\r\ninto the arenaceous stone termed Kentish Rag, In illustration of this\r\nopinion, Mr. Bensted directed my attention to the following remarkable\r\nfact, related in the _American Journal of Science_:--In the year 1836,\r\na fatal epidemic prevailed among the shell-fish of the Muskingum River,\r\nin the state of Ohio. It commenced in April, and continued until June,\r\ndestroying millions of the mollusca that inhabited the beds of the\r\ntributary streams, and the river. As the animals died, the valves\r\nof the shells opened, and, decomposition commencing, the muscular\r\nadhesions gave way, and the fleshy portions rose to the surface of\r\nthe water, leaving the shells in the bed of the river. As masses of\r\nthe dead bodies floated down the current, the headlands of islands,\r\npiles of drifted wood, and the shores of the river, in many places,\r\nwere covered with them; and the air in the vicinity was tainted with\r\nthe putrid effluvium exhaling from these accumulations of decomposing\r\nanimal matter. The cause of the epidemic was unknown.\r\n\r\n[391] Some of this _molluskite_ has, at my request, been analyzed by Mr.\r\nRigg, who obliged me with the following remarks:--\"After removing the\r\nlime by means of hydrochloric acid from ten grains of this substance,\r\nthere remained 1.2 grain of dark powder, which gave, by analysis with\r\noxide of copper, .16 of a cubic inch of carbonic acid, and a small\r\nportion of nitrogen. On subjecting to the same kind of analysis two\r\ngrains of the darker body, without previously acting upon it by any\r\nacid, .054 of a cubic inch of carbonic acid was obtained; so that\r\nfrom these results there is no doubt but the darker portion of the\r\nmolluskite contains about .35 per cent, of its weight of carbon in an\r\norganized state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now nearly the whole of the shells in the beds of Kentish Rag,\" Mr.\r\nBensted remarks, \"have their shells open, as if they were dead before\r\ntheir envelopment in the deposit. And, from the large quantity of\r\nwater-worn fragments of wood perforated by Pholades imbedded with them,\r\nit seems probable that this stratum had originally been a sand-bank\r\ncovered with drifted wood and shells, thus presenting a very analogous\r\ncondition to the phenomenon above described.\" The gelatinous bodies of\r\nthe _Trigoniæ_, _Ostreæ_, _Rostellariæ_, _Terebratulæ_, &c., detached\r\nfrom their shells, may have been intermingled with the drifted wood in\r\na sand-bank; while, in some instances, the animal matter would remain\r\nin the shells, be converted into molluskite, and retain the form of the\r\noriginal, as in the spiral univalve, represented in section, _Lign.\r\n139, fig. 3_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA microscopical examination of the Maidstone molluskite detects, with\r\na low power, innumerable portions of the nacreous laminæ of shells,\r\nintermingled with the carbonaceous matter, many siliceous spicula of\r\nSponges, minute spines of Echinoderms, and fragments of Corals; these\r\nextraneous bodies probably became entangled among the floating animal\r\nmatter. A large proportion of the shelly laminæ, examined with a high\r\npower, displays the peculiar structure of the _Terebratulæ_ (see\r\n_Lign. 126, fig. 2a_), of which several species are abundant in\r\nthe Kentish Rag.\r\n\r\nThe dark masses and veins so common in the Sussex and Purbeck marbles\r\nare produced by molluskite. If at the period of their envelopment\r\nthe shells were empty, they became filled either with grey marl and\r\nlimestone, or with white calcareous spar; but if they enclosed the\r\nbodies of the Mollusks, the soft mass was changed into carbonaceous\r\nmatter; and in polished sections of the marble, the _molluskite_\r\nappears either in black or dark brown spots, or fills up the cavities\r\nof the shells. The dark blotches and veins observable in the fine\r\npillars of Purbeck marble in the Temple Church, London, are produced\r\nby molluskite; and the most beautiful slabs of Sussex marble owe their\r\nappearance to the contrast produced by this black substance in contact\r\nwith white calcareous spar.[392]\r\n\r\n[392] See a \"Memoir on the Carbonized Remains of Mollusca,\" by the\r\nauthor. Read before the Geological Society of London, February, 1843;\r\nand published in the American Journal of Science.\r\n\r\nCarbon, resulting from animal remains, is of frequent occurrence\r\nin many strata; and the fetid emanations from certain limestones,\r\nupon being broken or rubbed, are attributable to the evolution of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, from the animal matter which they contain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nGeological Distribution of the Bivalve and Univalve Mollusca.--If the\r\nmore rare and splendid organic remains may be regarded as the \"Medals\r\nof Creation,\" the fossil testaceous mollusca, from their durability,\r\nnumbers and variety, may be considered as the current coin of Geology.\r\nOccurring in the most ancient fossiliferous strata in small numbers,\r\nand of peculiar types,--becoming more abundant and varied in the\r\nsecondary formations,--and increasing prodigiously, both numerically\r\nand specifically, in the tertiary, these relics are of inestimable\r\nvalue in the identification of a stratum in distant regions, and in\r\nthe determination of the relative age of a series of deposits. To the\r\nsolution of the former problem the sagacity of the late Dr. William\r\nSmith first suggested their applicability;[393] while the idea, so\r\nhappily conceived, and so philosophically candied out, by Sir C. Lyell,\r\nof arranging that heretofore chaotic mass of deposits, termed the\r\nTertiary, into groups, by the relative number of recent and extinct\r\nspecies of shells, demonstrated the important aid to be derived from\r\nthis class of organic remains, in the determination of some of the most\r\ndifficult questions in geological science.\r\n\r\n[393] See an interesting memoir of Dr, Smith, from the pen of his\r\ndistinguished nephew, Professor Phillips.\r\n\r\nMany useful tables have been constructed by Professor Phillips,[394]\r\nSir C. Lyell, M. Deshayes, M. D'Orbigny, Prof. E. Forbes, and other\r\neminent observers, to illustrate the geological distribution, in the\r\nseveral formations, of the genera and species of fossil shells hitherto\r\ndescribed. To the English student, Mr. Morris's \"Catalogue of British\r\nFossils,\" of which an enlarged edition is in the press, will be the\r\nmost valuable for reference.

Accurate descriptions and representations\r\nof all the British chalk shells, however, are still much required.\r\nMr. Davidson has done much towards the illustration of our Cretaceous\r\nBrachiopods; and the shells of the Cretaceous strata of the United\r\nStates are figured and described in an elegant work by Dr. Morton, of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tertiary Formations.\r\n\r\n        I.--Eocene. _Ly._ p. 174; _Wond._ p. 226.\r\n       II.--Miocene. _Ly._ p. 168.\r\n      III.--Pliocene. _Ly._ p. 161.\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured by Sir C.

Unfortunately,\r\nthis work has long been discontinued; and the rapid progress of\r\ndiscovery, and the numerous foreign publications on every department\r\nof fossil conchology, almost forbid the hope that it will be resumed\r\nby the present proprietor. Although the high price of this work places\r\nit beyond the reach of many individuals, it will be found in most\r\nlibraries of Natural History.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nOn the Collection and Arrangement of Fossil Shells.--The instructions\r\nalready given for the collection of corals, echinoderms, &c., will\r\nhave familiarized the student with the methods generally adopted,\r\nand render it unnecessary to enter into much detail. The shells in\r\narenaceous deposits, particularly in those of the Tertiary formations,\r\nare commonly so perfect, as merely to require careful removal: those in\r\nthe clays are more fragile, and must be extracted with great caution;\r\nand, when very delicate, should be left attached to the clay or shale.\r\nThe specimens extracted entire may be kept either in paper trays, lined\r\nwith wadding, or fixed to pieces of card or thin board covered with\r\npaper, by thick gum-water; three or four specimens being attached in\r\ndifferent positions, so as to expose the essential characters, as the\r\naperture, spire, and back of the univalves, and the hinge, muscular\r\nimprints, &c. of the bivalves. Where only casts remain, search should\r\nbe made for an impression of the outer surface of the shell, and a cast\r\ntaken of it in wax, kneaded bread, or plaster of Paris. In indurated\r\nclays, sometimes both shells and casts may be obtained; and a specimen\r\nof each should be preserved. Mastic varnish, or solution of gum\r\ntragacanth, delicately applied to fragile shells, tends to preserve\r\nthem, and improves their appearance. It is desirable to collect the\r\nsame species in various states of growth; the form of the young shell\r\n(as in _Rostellaria ampla_, of Solander) often differing essentially\r\nfrom that of the adult. It will be found convenient to have trays or\r\nboards of different colours; and to select one tint for the shells\r\ncollected from a particular formation, or deposit; for example, the\r\nnewer Tertiary may be placed on yellow paper; the older, or Eocene\r\nfossils, on light-blue. It is also desirable to separate the marine\r\nfrom the fresh-water species.\r\n\r\nShells imbedded in chalk, limestone, &c., often require much labour\r\nto display their more delicate and important characters. For clearing\r\nchalk specimens, a stout penknife, and a few gravers or gouges of\r\nvarious sizes, will be necessary; and by a little practice, the spines\r\nof the Spondylus (_Lign. 128_), and the beaks and hinge of Inocerami\r\n(_Lign. 129_), &c., may be readily exposed. A small stiffish brush,\r\nused with water, is also serviceable. The shells in compact stone,\r\nas those of the mountain limestone, must generally be cleared with\r\nthe hammer and chisel. Common species may be broken out, and, from\r\nseveral examples, probably one or two will be found perfect; but choice\r\nand rare specimens should not be thus risked; they will amply repay\r\nthe trouble of the less expeditious method of chiselling away the\r\nsurrounding stone. Casts may be taken in gutta percha, &c.\r\n\r\nTo determine the names of the specimens that he has collected should be\r\nthe next care of the student. No method will so readily initiate the\r\nyoung collector in fossil conchology, as the careful examination of\r\na small series of the common species, with their names attached.[396]\r\nBy the geological map,[397] the nature of the deposit in which the\r\nlocality of the specimens is situated, may be ascertained; and the\r\nremarks previously advanced on the prevailing shells of each formation,\r\nwill afford a general idea of the genera to which they belong; and, by\r\nreferring to the figures quoted, the specific names may be determined.\r\n\r\n[396] Such a series may be obtained, at very little cost, of dealers in\r\nobjects of natural history; as, Messrs. Tennant, Sowerby, the British\r\nNatural History Society, &c. See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[397] A Geological Map of England and Wales, coloured by Mr. Woodward,\r\nunder the direction of Sir R. I.

II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\n_Illustrative of the mode of developing Fossil Fishes in Chalk._\r\n\r\nOsmeroides Mantelli: a Fossil Smelt; from the _Chalk_, Lewes.\r\n\r\nSee page 626.\r\n\r\n(_One-third natural size._)\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--The two corresponding surfaces of a block of Chalk split asunder. The\r\nirregular oval lines, seen on each surface, are the only apparent indications\r\nthat the stone contains an extraneous body.\r\n\r\n2.--In this figure the two pieces represented above are shown cemented\r\ntogether; care having been taken that the oval markings on each\r\nsurface were accurately adjusted. The chalk has been chiselled away\r\nin the supposed longitudinal direction of the enclosed extraneous\r\nbody, and part of the scaly surface of a fish has been thus brought to\r\nlight. A portion of chalk has also been removed towards both ends,\r\nwith the view of ascertaining the extent and direction of the fossil;\r\nand at each place indications of its presence are visible.\r\n\r\n3.--Represents the specimen completely developed. It proves to be a fish\r\nalmost perfect, lying on its back, with the body uncompressed, the\r\nmouth open, the arches and opercula of the gills expanded, and the\r\ndorsal, pectoral, and ventral fins entire. The caudal fin, or tail, is\r\nimperfect. The original is nine inches long, and is one of the most\r\nextraordinary fossil fishes ever discovered. It belongs to the Salmon\r\nfamily, and is allied to the Osmerus, or Smelt; it is now in the British\r\nMuseum. We thus perceive that the oval markings on the surface of\r\nfig. 1 were occasioned by the section of the scales covering the cylindrical\r\nbody of the fish (see p. 627). A magnified view of one of the\r\nscales is figured _Lign. 185, fig. 4_, p. 567.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIST OF LIGNOGRAPHS IN VOL.

It is therefore necessary to enter\r\nsomewhat in detail on the structure of these beings, that the student\r\nmay obtain a correct idea of the nature of the curious fossils to which\r\nthe mineralized remains of the durable parts of these animals have\r\ngiven rise, and whose origin has but lately been correctly ascertained.\r\nThe body of these mollusca is either enclosed in a shell, as in the\r\n_Nautilus_, or contains a calcareous or cartilaginous part, as in\r\nthe _Sepia_, or cuttle-fish; they have a distinct head, and eyes as\r\nperfect as in the vertebrate animals; complicated organs of hearing;\r\nand a powerful manducatory apparatus, surrounded by arms serving for\r\nprehension. They have below the head a tube which acts as a locomotive\r\ninstrument to propel the animal backwards, by the forcible ejection\r\nof the water that has served the purposes of respiration, and which\r\ncan be thrown out with considerable force by the contraction of the\r\nbody. The figures 1 and 6, _Lign. 142_, are views of a naked (that is,\r\n_shell-less_) cephalopod, showing the arms, eyes, and a pair of fins,\r\nfor swimming. The Cephalopoda, thus endowed with powerful organs of\r\nlocomotion, traverse the seas unrestricted, and are seen in groups of\r\nmyriads in the midst of the ocean, and only appear periodically near\r\nthe shores. Their fossil remains consist of--\r\n\r\n1st. The external shells; which are generally symmetrical, and either\r\nstraight (as in _Orthoceras_, _Lign. 155_); arched or bent (as in\r\n_Crioceras_, _Lign. 160_); spiral (as in _Turrilites_, _Lign. 163_); or\r\ninvolute,[399] and simple (as in the _Argonaut_), or divided, by smooth\r\nor foliaceous partitions, into chambers or air-cells, connected by a\r\nhydraulic tube or siphuncle (as in _Nautilus_, _Lign._ 149 and 150, and\r\n_Ammonites_, _Lign._ 156 and 157).\r\n\r\n[399] _Involute_, as applied to the shells of Cephalopoda, implies that\r\nthe inner whorls are embraced by the outer turn or whorl; _convolute_,\r\nthe inner turns apparent, or exposed; _evolute_, the whorls coiled in\r\none plane, but not touching each other; _revolute_, the extremities\r\nbent inwards.\r\n\r\n2dly. The internal horny or calcareous support, called _osselet_, and\r\nits appendages.[400] (_Lign. 143._)\r\n\r\n[400] The _bone_ or _shell_ of the Cuttle-fish, the friable part of\r\nwhich, reduced to powder, forms _pounce_, is the _osselet_ of that\r\ncephalopod.\r\n\r\n3dly. The ink-bladder, with its inspissated contents, termed _sepia_.\r\n\r\n4thly. The mandibles of the mouth, or beaks, called _Rhyncholites_.\r\n(_Lign. 150_, _fig._ 1.)\r\n\r\n5thly. The soft parts of the animal in the state of molluskite;\r\nimpressions of the head and tentacula, and remains of the clasps or\r\ncurved hooks of the arms of some species (see _Lign._ 140 and 145).\r\n\r\nThese several parts are generally found separate, but they sometimes\r\noccur in their proper relative position, and from such examples the\r\nnature of the original may be determined.\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopoda[401] are divided into two orders, according to\r\nthe number of their organs of respiration, or gills; namely,\r\nthe _Dibranchiata_, or those which have two gills, (called also\r\n_Acetabulifera_, from their arms being furnished with rows of little\r\ncups or suckers;) and the _Tetrabranchiata_, which have four gills, or\r\nbranchiæ, and very numerous arms without suckers.\r\n\r\n[401] The best systematic account of the Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda,\r\nboth recent and fossil, yet published, is contained in the first part\r\nof the very valuable Manual of Mollusca, by Mr. S. P. Woodward, of the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CEPHALOPODA]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL DIBRANCHIATE CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\nThe _Argonaut_, or Paper Nautilus, whose elegant fragile shell is too\r\nwell known to require description, is the only living genus of this\r\nOrder, in which the animal is protected by a hard calcareous external\r\ncovering. This shell is symmetrical, and convoluted on a vertical\r\nplane, and consists of but one cavity or chamber. The other genera\r\nare naked, and possess an internal chambered shell (as in the recent\r\n_Spirula_), or some modification of such an apparatus. The last chamber\r\nor cell of these enclosed shells is too small to admit any part of the\r\nbody of the animal; a character by which the fossil species of this\r\nOrder may be distinguished from those of the other order. Others have\r\na horny or calcareous osselet, as the bone of the Cuttle-fish, and pen\r\nof the Calamary or Sea-pen (see _Bd._ pl. 28); and in an appendage of\r\nthis kind a conical chambered shell is contained in many of the fossil\r\ngenera, hereafter to be noticed. These animals have eight arms, with\r\nthe addition in some genera of two long tentacula, which are furnished\r\nwith rows of suctorial disks or cups, called _acetabula_ (see _Lign.\r\n142, figs. 1, 6_).\r\n\r\nThese naked Cephalopoda, devoid of any external defence, possess a very\r\nextraordinary means of escape from their enemies. They are furnished\r\nwith a bag or bladder, containing a dark fluid resembling ink in\r\nappearance, which they have the power of ejecting into the surrounding\r\nwater upon the approach of danger; and by the obscurity t us induced,\r\nthey foil the pursuit of their adversaries: the Nautilus and other\r\ncephalopods, protected by a large external shell, are destitute of such\r\nan apparatus. The deep brown colour, _sepia_, was formerly prepared\r\nfrom the fluid of the ink-bags of different species of Cuttle-fish; a\r\nsimilar substance secreted by extinct naked Cephalopoda, as we shall\r\npresently demonstrate, is found in a fossil state. These preliminary\r\nremarks on the organization of the recent animals will prepare us for\r\nthe investigation of the extinct species. We will first notice those\r\nremarkable fossils, called _Belemnites_, or thunder-stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 141.

Among the innumerable relics of an\r\nearlier world, which swarm in the sedimentary deposits, there are\r\nperhaps no fossil bodies that have excited more curiosity, and given\r\nrise to so many fruitless conjectures as to their nature and origin,\r\nas the Belemnites.[402] These are long, cylindrical, or fusiform\r\nfossils, more or less pointed at one extremity, and having at the\r\nother and larger end a conical cavity, which is either occupied by a\r\nchambered shell, or filled up with the material in which the fossils\r\nare imbedded. Their substance is like fibrous calcareous spar, varying\r\nin colour from a dark brown to a light amber; many are transparent,\r\nothers nearly opaque. When broken transversely they present a radiated\r\nstructure (_Lign. 141, fig. 1_) and a minute central cavity, or axis,\r\nis seen to extend through the whole length of the solid portion of the\r\nstone (see _Lign. 142, fig. 5._). A longitudinal section (_Lign._\r\n142, _figs._ 4 and 5) shows the conical cavity in the upper part, and\r\nthat the shaft consists of a series of concentric layers. Such are the\r\ncharacters of these fossils in the examples of most frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n[402] See Park. Org. Rem. vol. iii. p. 122.\r\n\r\nThe Belemnites vary in size from the small, delicate, transparent\r\nspecies, _Lign._ 142, _figs._ 3 and 4, to massy opaque specimens,\r\nseveral inches in circumference, and from ten to twenty inches in\r\nlength. They present also considerable variety of form; some are\r\nregularly cylindrical, as in _Lign. 141 fig. 1_; others broad and\r\nflattened, as in _fig. 4_; or subfusiform, as in _Lign._ 142, _figs._ 3\r\nand 4. The small end is slender and pointed in some belemnites, and in\r\nothers is obtuse, or rounded, with a projecting point. In many there is\r\na longitudinal groove or furrow on the ventral aspect; and some species\r\nhave a furrow on each side, as in that represented in _Lign. 142,\r\nfig. 2_.\r\n\r\nBut the fossils above described are only a part of the original\r\nstructure of the Belemnite. When in a perfect state, the cavity seen in\r\n_Lign. 142, fig. 5_, is occupied by a chambered conical shell, called\r\nthe _phragmocone_, composed of a series of shallow concave cells, of a\r\nnacreous or pearly substance, which are pierced by a siphuncle at the\r\nmargin; see _Lign. 141, fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the Belemnite at present known consist of--\r\n\r\n1st. The spathose osselet, or _guard_, having at the larger end a\r\nconical cavity, called the _alveolus_, as in _Lign. 141, fig. 1_, and\r\n_Lign. 142, fig. 5_.\r\n\r\n2dly. A conical, chambered pearly shell, termed the _phragmocone_,\r\nwhich is situated in the _alveolus_ (as in _Lign. 141, fig. 2_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 142.

D’Orbigny, is represented _Lign._ 142, _figs._\r\n1 and 6. The indefatigable and successful researches of the Rev. Dr.\r\nBuckland have confirmed the general correctness of this restoration.\r\nIn the Lias of Dorsetshire two specimens of the Belemnite, with its\r\nchambered shell and horny or pearly receptacle, still retaining the\r\nink-bag and its contents, have been discovered, and were figured in\r\nthe Br. Treatise (_Bd._ pl. 44′, 44″). A third specimen, showing the\r\nink-bag, is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe ink-bag of the Belemnite is very small, as might be expected, from\r\nthe extent to which it is protected by a chambered shell. The mandibles\r\nor beaks of the Belemnite are supposed to have been horny, as in the\r\nother naked Cephalopoda; since no calcareous beaks have been found\r\nassociated with their remains.\r\n\r\n\"The Belemnite having the advantage of its dense, but well-balanced\r\ninternal shell, must have exercised the power of swimming backwards\r\nand forwards, which it possessed in common with the modern decapod\r\n(_ten-armed_) Dibranchiata, with great vigour and precision. Its\r\nposition was probably more commonly vertical than in its recent\r\ncongeners. It would rise swiftly and stealthily to infix its claws\r\nin the belly of a supernatant fish, and then perhaps as swiftly dart\r\ndown, and drag its prey to the bottom and devour it. We cannot doubt\r\nat least but that, like the hooked Calamaries of the present seas, the\r\nancient Belemnites were the most formidable and predacious of their\r\nclass.\"--Owen.\r\n\r\nThe Belemnites of the oolitic limestones frequently contain the\r\nphragmocone, either filled with calcareous spar, or with its cells\r\nempty. In the clays the horny sheath or receptacle is sometimes found\r\npressed flat and extending above the alveolus of the osselet, and has\r\noften a thin coat of nacre of a pearly lustre, but it is more commonly\r\ndetached.\r\n\r\nThe Belemnites abound in the Lias, Oolite, and Chalk, and have not\r\nbeen discovered in any other deposits; there are nearly thirty British\r\nspecies, some of which are restricted to the Chalk, and others to the\r\nOolite and Lias.\r\n\r\nA few characteristic forms are represented, _Lign._ 141 and 142, in\r\norder to illustrate the three groups which, according to M. D’Orbigny,\r\nare peculiar to the grand divisions of the Cretaceous formation.\r\n\r\n1. Belemnitella mucronata. _Lign. 141, fig. 1._--The name\r\n_Belemnitella_ is given to those Belemnites which have a slit, or\r\ncrevice, on the anterior margin of the alveolus or cavity, and two\r\nlateral impressions. The surface is sometimes granulated, and often has\r\nvascular markings, produced by the investing integument of the living\r\nanimal. The form of the aperture is shown in the middle dextral figure;\r\nand the radiated structure, as seen by a transverse section, in the\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nThis species is abundant in the _White Chalk_, particularly in certain\r\nlocalities in Norfolk and Devonshire. It is more frequent in the chalk\r\nof Kent than in that of Sussex; and in the cretaceous strata around\r\nBrighton, than in those near Lewes. I have never been able to detect\r\nthe least vestige of the phragmocone, or chambered shell, in the\r\nalveolus. This Belemnite is occasionally imbedded in flint nodules; and\r\nsuch examples possess the calcareous crystalline structure of the chalk\r\nand limestone specimens. In the chalk of Ireland, the Belemnites which\r\nhave been corroded, or perforated by marine borers (_cliona_), are\r\noften injected with flint; and if the calcareous substance be removed\r\nby immersion in dilute hydrochloric acid, exquisite siliceous casts\r\nmay be obtained (see also page 403). It is not unusual to find flints\r\nwith a cavity, occasioned by the solution and removal of the calcareous\r\nguard, and having a siliceous conical cast of the alveolus, occupying\r\nthe upper part of the interspace. The reader will recollect that the\r\npulley-stones of the Derbyshire Encrinites were produced by a similar\r\nprocess (see p. 285, vol. i.).\r\n\r\nThe American cretaceous sands abound in a species of Belemnitella,\r\nnearly related to _B. mucronata_.\r\n\r\n2. Belemnites Listeri. _Lign. 142, fig. 3._--This small elegant\r\nBelemnite has two lateral grooves, and is generally as transparent as\r\namber; it has frequently a nacreous or calcareous pellicle partially\r\ninvesting the guard. It seldom exceeds two inches in length. It is\r\nabundant in, and peculiar to, the Galt, or blue marl of the Chalk, and\r\nis constantly associated with the Inocerami, previously described as\r\ncommon at Folkstone, Bletchingley, Ringmer, and other localities of\r\nthat deposit. The Red Chalk of Norfolk contains the same species (_Min.\r\nConch._ tab. 589).\r\n\r\n3. Belemnites dilatatus. _Lign. 141, fig. 4._--This species is\r\ndistinguished by its flattened form, and by the longitudinal furrow\r\nbeing situated on the margin opposite to the siphuncle of the\r\nphragmocone, instead of being on the same side, as is most usual. It is\r\nsupposed by M. D’Orbigny to be characteristic of the Neocomian beds, or\r\nlowermost division of the Shanklin Sand.\r\n\r\n4. The Chalk-marl contains a Belemnite of a more elongated form than\r\nthose above described, the apex gradually tapering to a point, with a\r\nslight double furrow on each side. It is named _B. lanceolatus_ (_Sow.\r\nMin. Conch._ tab. 600, figs. 8, 9), and is very common in the marl-pits\r\nat Steyning, Clayton, and Hamsey, in Sussex.\r\n\r\nAt the base of Golden Cap Hill, near Charmouth, there are two strata\r\nof marl-stone observable on the shore, which are literally paved with\r\nBelemnites. Great numbers of these fossils have Serpulæ and other\r\nextraneous shells attached to them, a proof that the ink-bags and other\r\nsoft parts of the mollusks had decomposed, and that the guards had lain\r\nuncovered at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nM. De Koninck has discovered in the Devonian limestone of Belgium, at\r\nCouvin and Visé, a small fossil body which closely resembles in form\r\nand structure the rostrum or guard of a belemnite; it is, however, too\r\nfragmentary to admit of positive detemination.[404]\r\n\r\n[404] Bulletin del’Académie Roy ale de Bruxelles, tome x.

The body is of an\r\nelongated form, with a pair of lateral fins, two large sessile eyes,\r\neight uncinated arms, and a pair of armed tentacles; each arm was\r\nfurnished with from twenty to forty pairs of hooks, placed alternately.\r\nLike the Sepia it had a pigmental sac or ink-bag, which is generally\r\nfound filled with the inspissated secretion. The inferior part of the\r\nbody is of a conical form, and contains a brown horny osselet, with a\r\nsiphunculated phragmocone, that terminates in a guard or rostrum of a\r\nfibrous structure.\r\n\r\n[In the recent genus _Onychoteuthis_, the tentacles alone are armed\r\nwith claws; _Enoploteuthis_ has claws both on the arms and on the\r\ntentacles, but the latter are long and feeble, and the hooks are\r\nconfined to their extremities. The extinct _Belemnoteuthis_ (like the\r\n_Acanthoteuthis_ of Solenhofen, _Lign. 140_) had eight nearly equal\r\narms, the dorsal pair being rather smaller than the rest; each arm\r\nwas furnished with twenty to forty pairs of hooks, forming a double,\r\nalternating row. The tentacles were not longer than the arms, and like\r\nthem had a double series of hooks extending from their bases to the\r\npoints. In all essential points of structure, the Belemnoteuthis is\r\nmost nearly related to the Calamaries (_Teuthidæ_), but, in consequence\r\nof the prolongation of its pointed shell posteriorly, the fins\r\nbecome lateral (as in _Sepiola_ and _Sepia_), instead of terminal.\r\nWhilst the complicated (chambered) structure of its shell, and the\r\npeculiar character of the _tentacles_, show that it must be regarded\r\nas a type distinct from and equal in importance to the Calamaries.\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the _Belemnite_ and _Conoteuthis_ present\r\nsimilar conditions of the soft parts; and the four genera will form\r\nthe Family Belemnitidæ. The normal position of these animals in the\r\nsea is horizontal, whilst that of the Nautiloid genera must have been\r\nvertical, with the head downwards.--_Mr. Woodward._]\r\n\r\nThe fossils which have afforded this unexpected and highly interesting\r\nillustration of the nature of the extinct animals of this Order\r\nhave been obtained by closely examining the shales in which they\r\nabound, and, before removing the solid osselet, carefully searching\r\nthe surrounding stone for traces of the more perishable parts. The\r\nattention of the collector can scarcely be too often directed to the\r\nnecessity of examining the surrounding matrix before extricating a\r\nfossil from its bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 147.

(_Bd._ pl. xliv. _fig._ 15. _Min.

The guard, which is of\r\nan oblong form, with an obtuse apex, has the structure of the osselet\r\nof the Sepia, and contains in its upper part a phragmocone, the cells\r\nof which are very narrow. In strata of the same age, in France, three\r\nspecies have been discovered by M. Deshayes. I allude to these shells,\r\nthat the attention of the collector may be directed to the search after\r\nother examples in our tertiary deposits.\r\n\r\nFossil Calamary, or Squid. Geoteuthis.[406] (_Bd._ pl. xxviii.\r\nxxix.)--The common Calamary (_Loligo vulgaris_) is so often seen on our\r\nshores, that its general aspect must be familiar to all who frequent\r\nthe sea-side. In this animal, the osselet, or internal support, is a\r\ncartilaginous elongated body, which, from its form, is called Sea-pen\r\n(_Bd._ pl. xxviii.); and even this delicate structure is found in\r\na fossil state. In the Lias of Lyme Regis, Miss Mary Aiming first\r\ndiscovered specimens of _Sea-pens_ in juxtaposition with the ink-bag,\r\nas in the recent Calamary; and subsequently many similar examples\r\nhave been found, both in England and on the Continent. Dr. Buckland\r\nhas given some exquisite figures of these fossils; and his collection\r\ncontains a matchless series of these most interesting organic remains.\r\nIn some specimens the ink-bag and its tube or duct, but little\r\ncompressed, are occasionally met with, having a brilliant nacreous\r\npellicle, the remains of the sheath, attached to the surface. The\r\nink-bag is sometimes of considerable magnitude; specimens have been\r\nfound at Lyme Regis nearly a foot in length.[407] The circumstance of\r\nthe ink-bags being generally full of sepia admits of the inference (as\r\nDr. Buckland with his wonted acumen remarks), that these individuals\r\ndied suddenly; for their living analogues reject the inky fluid\r\nupon the least approach of danger. The perfect condition of the bag\r\nproves also their instantaneous enclosure in the deposit, for the\r\ndistended membrane would otherwise have burst from decomposition,\r\nand the contents would have escaped. The fossil marine reptiles, the\r\nIchthyosauri, &c., with which these fossils are associated, present\r\nsimilar phenomena, as we shall hereafter have occasion to remark, and\r\nstrengthen the probability, that swarms of the inhabitants of the\r\nLiassic ocean were suddenly destroyed, and imbedded, on the area now\r\noccupied by their remains.\r\n\r\n[406] Geoteuthis has hooks on its arms; hut, being a Calamary\r\n(_Teuthid_), it would probably have unequal arms.--_Mr. Woodward._\r\n\r\n[407] The large ink-bags figured by Dr. Buckland (Br. Tr. vol. i. pp.\r\n372-379, pl. xliv′.) belonged to the great Geoteuthis Bollensis, of\r\nSchuble.--_Mr. Woodward._\r\n\r\nIn the cream-coloured limestone, of Solenhofen, so rich in organic\r\nremains of the highest interest (_Wond._ p. 578), the soft parts\r\nof naked Cephalopoda have also been discovered. I have figured,\r\n_Lign. 140_, a beautiful specimen obtained by the late Count Münster,\r\nwhich exhibits an imprint of the body, the arms and tentacles being\r\nrepresented by ten double rows of horny hooks, which precisely resemble\r\nthose of Belemnoteuthis. M. D’Orbigny supposes that the original animal\r\nclosely resembled a recent decapod called _Enoploteuthis leptura_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 148. Fossil Shells related to the Argonaut.[408]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Bellerophon costatus. _Mt. Limestone._ _Yorkshire._\r\n       2.--Bellerophon bilobatus. _Sil. Syst._\r\n\r\n[408] Some naturalists consider the Bellerophon to be allied to the\r\nCarinaria (_Heteropod_).\r\n]\r\n\r\nBellerophon.--It has been already stated, that the animals of one\r\ngenus of the existing dibranchiate Cephalopoda are protected by a\r\nthin, flexible, symmetrical, keeled shell, convoluted on a vertical\r\nplane, and having but one chamber--this is the _Argonaut_, or _Paper\r\nNautilus_, an inhabitant of the Mediterranean. This animal belongs\r\nto the Octopoda, or those which have eight arms; and in one pair of\r\nthese processes the extremities expand into broad and thin membranes,\r\nby which the delicate, elastic, calcareous envelopement, or shell,\r\nis secreted. There membranes usually encompass the shell, and meet\r\nand overlap each other along its keel; and by them chiefly the shell\r\nis retained in its position. When these membranes are withdrawn, or\r\nthe animal dies, the shell, having no muscular connexion with the\r\nsoft parts, readily separates from the body. Hence the doubts so long\r\nentertained as to the relation between the animal of the Argonaut and\r\nits shell, but which are now set at rest; the observations on the\r\nliving animal by Madame Tower, and the anatomical demonstrations by\r\nM. Sander Rang, having removed the obscurity in which the subject was\r\nformerly involved.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous deposits there are\r\nseveral species of a genus of shells, the animals of which are by\r\nsome considered to have been analogous to the recent Argonaut. It is\r\nnamed Bellerophon. I have figured two species; one from the Mountain\r\nLimestone, _Lign. 148, fig. 1_; the other from the Silurian System.\r\nThere are about thirty British species, most of which are of small\r\nsize; some of them are keeled, others have a slight dorsal depression,\r\nas in _fig. 1_. and many have the back rounded, and the sides lobed, as\r\nin _Lign. 148, fig. 2_ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL TETRABRANCHIATE CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of the existence of any British fossils analogous to\r\nSpirula (_dibranchiate_); for the minute fossil polythalamia, formerly\r\nreferred to this class, are now known to have belonged to animals\r\npossessing an organization altogether different, as we have already\r\nexplained (see p. 369). I therefore proceed to notice the fossil\r\nremains of those _Cephalopoda_ which were furnished with an external\r\nshell having its cavity divided by cells, which are perforated by a\r\nhydraulic tube or siphuncle; and of which group the recent Nautilus is\r\nthe type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 149. Nautilus pompilius in its shell.\r\n\r\n  _a._ The animal, occupying the last or body chamber of the shell.\r\n  _b._ The shell cut vertically through the middle, and showing the\r\n       air-chambers and the siphuncle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe appearance and structure of the recent shell are familiar to\r\nevery one; a correct knowledge of the nature of the original animal\r\nhas, however, been obtained but very recently. In its general\r\ncharacters the animal of the Nautilus, which is an inhabitant of the\r\nseas of hot climates, resembles the naked Cephalopoda; it possesses\r\nfour _branchiæ_, or gills, and numerous hollow arms and retractile\r\ntentacula. Its head is furnished with a muscular flattened disk, which\r\nserves as an operculum to the shell when the animal is retracted. The\r\nbeaks are horny, and coated at their tips by calcareous matter. It has\r\nno ink-bag, and is destitute of fins or other organs for swimming. The\r\nbody occupies the ample outer cell of the shell, to which it is firmly\r\nattached by two lateral muscles; and it has a siphuncle, that passes\r\nfrom the posterior part of the animal through the shelly tube, and by\r\nwhich communication is maintained with the entire series of cells or\r\nchambers. The siphuncle is provided with a small artery and vein, and\r\ntraverses the entire series of chambers, thus maintaining the vitality\r\nof the shell. Mr. Edwards considers that \"it may be looked upon as an\r\nelongated cæcum, and that it is not under any circumstances used by the\r\nanimal as a hydrostatic balance.\"[409]\r\n\r\n[409] The reader interested in this subject should consult the\r\n_Memoirs_ by M. Valenciennes, Mem. de l’Inst.; M. Vander Hoven, in the\r\nProceedings of the Zoological Society; Prof. Owen’s _Memoir on the\r\nPearly Nautilus_, Mr. Gray’s paper in the An. Nat. Hist., Mr. Edward’s\r\nMonograph in the Palæont. Soc., and Mr. Woodward’s _Manual_.\r\n\r\nUpon making a vertical section of the shell, the inner volutions\r\nare exposed, and the cavity is seen divided at regular intervals\r\ninto cells, by smooth, concave, nacreous septa; these vary in number\r\naccording to the age of the individual; there are about thirty-five\r\nin an adult specimen. The partitions are pierced in the _centre_ by\r\na shelly tube, which traverses each cell to within a short distance\r\nof the next partition; and this tube is rendered a continuous channel\r\nin the living animal, by the membranous siphuncle. This series of\r\nair-chambers constitutes an apparatus which renders the Nautilus nearly\r\nof the same specific gravity as the surrounding water, and enables\r\nit to rise to the surface of the sea, or sink to the bottom, by a\r\nvery small amount of muscular exertion. The Nautilus swims, like the\r\nCuttle-fish, by expelling the water from its respiratory chamber; the\r\nwalls of which are very thick and powerful muscles.\r\n\r\nFrom this very general description of the only living representative\r\nof the numerous genera of tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda, which swarmed\r\nin such prodigious numbers in the ancient seas, we may pass to the\r\nconsideration of the fossil Nautili, and their related congeners. Our\r\nremarks must be limited to the genera that will serve to demonstrate\r\nthe most important modifications of structure, and explain the nature\r\nof the fossil remains of this extensive class of extinct beings.\r\n\r\nThe genera into which these shells are distributed are founded upon\r\nthe mode in which the shell is coiled, its form, the character of the\r\npartitions or septa, and the situation of the siphuncle. A little\r\nreflection will enable the student to understand the principles of\r\nthis classification. The essential character of all the shells of this\r\nclass, is to have an external chamber larger than the inner chambers,\r\nand which contains the body of the animal; to be divided internally\r\ninto different compartments, by partitions (concavo-convex, with the\r\nconcavity outwards); and to have a pipe or tube extending from the\r\nouter open chamber to the innermost cell. They are divided into three\r\ngroups or families.\r\n\r\n1. The Nautilidæ (_Bd._ pl. xxxi.): in these the septa are smooth, or\r\nbut slightly undulated, and the siphuncle either traverses the centre\r\nof the cell-partitions, or is situated towards the inner margin or turn\r\nof the spire.\r\n\r\n2. The Orthoceratidæ (_Lign. 155_): in these the siphuncle is\r\ncomplicated in its structure; it is central or lateral; the septa are\r\nsmooth. (_Woodward’s Man. Moll._ p. 87.)\r\n\r\n3. The Ammonitidæ (_Bd._ pl. xxxv-xlii.): in these the septa are\r\nmore or less waved, and their margins foliated or crenated, that is,\r\nindented; and the siphuncle is situated at or near the outer margin.\r\n\r\nIn the Nautilus, the shell is convoluted on the same plane, in spiral\r\nwhorls, all of which are contiguous, and the siphuncle is central.\r\n\r\nThe British strata contain about sixty species of Nautili. The\r\nTertiary formations have yielded five or six; the Cretaceous a like\r\nnumber; the Lias and Oolite ten or eleven; the Carboniferous about\r\nthirty species; and the Devonian two species. In the London Clay a\r\nlarge and beautiful species is abundant (_Nautilus imperialis._ _Min.\r\nConch._ tab. i.), having the shell very commonly entire; but the outer\r\nopaque coat frequently flakes off, and exposes the pearly or nacreous\r\ninternal layer. The septa generally retain their original nacreous\r\nstructure, and the cells are either occupied by clay or marl, or are\r\npartially filled or lined with calcareous spar, brilliant pyrites, or\r\nother mineral matter. These Nautili are often found constituting the\r\nnuclei of the _septaria_, or clay nodules, with which this deposit\r\nabounds.[410] The small species, _N. centralis_ (_Ly._ _fig._ 179),\r\nand _Nautilus_ (_Aturia_) _ziczac_ (_Wond._ p. 247), occur in the same\r\nstrata. The London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey and of the coasts of\r\nHants and Sussex is productive of these fossils.\r\n\r\n[410] Three other well-marked species are figured and described by Mr.\r\nEdwards (Monog. Pal. Soc.) from the English eocene strata: viz. _N.\r\nSowerbyi_, _N. urbanus_, and _N. regalis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 150.

A large and beautiful species,\r\n_Nautilus elegans_ (_Min. Conch._ tab. 116), is not unusual in the\r\nmarl-pits near Lewes, Clayton, Steyning, &c. and may be considered as\r\ncharacteristic of that portion of the Cretaceous deposits. The first\r\nspecimen discovered (_Foss. South D._ tab. xx) was from the marl-bank\r\nimmediately at the foot of the mound on which stands the church of\r\nHamsey, a little hamlet on the north of Lewes; a spot from which I\r\nobtained numerous other cephalopodous shells, at that time unknown as\r\nBritish species. The collocation of fossils at Hamsey is similar to\r\nthat observable in the quarries at St. Catherine’s Mount, near Rouen.\r\nThese remains only occur as casts, no vestige of the shell remaining;\r\nbut sections will sometimes show the situation of the siphon, its tube\r\nbeing filled with a different material from that which occupies the\r\ncells. This is exemplified in the section of a smaller species (_N.\r\npseudo-elegans_, _Lign. 150, fig. 2_), in which the channel of the\r\nsiphon is filled with a dark-coloured marl, _a_; the lines formed by\r\nthe section of the smooth septa are also shown. In the same lignograph,\r\n_fig. 3_, a front view and profile of another chalk-marl Nautilite are\r\nfigured.[411]\r\n\r\n[411] The student will find a section of the shell of the recent\r\nNautilus a very instructive object of comparison, in the investigation\r\nof the fossils of this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 151. Nautilus elegans.\r\n\r\n_Lower Chalk._ _Lewes._ (1/6 _nat. size_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 152. Nautilus Saxbyi. _Lower Greensand._]\r\n\r\nIn the Chalk, as well as in many other calcareous deposits, the shells\r\nof the Nautili, Ammonites, &c. are very rarely preserved; even the\r\ninternal septa are often dissolved, and the stony casts, moulded in the\r\ncells, remain distinct, and readily separate (_Lign. 153_). An entire\r\nseries, from the innermost cell to the outer chamber, may sometimes be\r\nobtained (in the Coralline Oolite); forming, as it were, a dissected\r\nmodel of the internal structure.[412] The beaks or mandibles are\r\noccasionally found fossil (_Lign. 150, fig. 1_).\r\n\r\n[412] _Bd._ pl. xlii. _fig._ 1: see also plates xxxi. to xliii., for\r\nillustrations of Nautilites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 153.

It differs from\r\nthe allied genera in the siphuncle being situated on the inner margin\r\nof the septa. The shell is discoidal, and the septa are very slightly\r\nlobed. At Elbersreuth, near Bareuth, in the N. E. of Bavaria, the\r\nDevonian strata abound in these shells; thirty-five species have been\r\nfound, the greater number being peculiar to that locality.\r\n\r\nIn England they are chiefly found at South Petherwin, Cornwall, and in\r\nthe Devonshire marbles. (_See Phillip’s Pal. Foss. Devonshire._)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORTHOCERAS.]\r\n\r\nOrthoceras (straight shell), _Lign. 155._--The shells of this genus\r\nmay be described as Nautili uncoiled and extended in a straight line.\r\nThey are straight, elongated, chambered shells, with smooth and gently\r\nundulated septa, which are concave towards the opening or upper part,\r\nand have the siphuncle either central, or not far removed from the\r\ncentre. The _Orthoceratites_ more especially belong to the ancient\r\nSecondary strata. They first appear in the Silurian, and abound in\r\nthe Devonian and Carboniferous. They vary in size from a few inches\r\nto several feet in length, and eight or nine inches in diameter; and\r\nin form, from a slender elongated cone, to a short, massy, almost\r\nspherical figure, with a contracted orifice. Some examples have been\r\nnoticed with upwards of sixty cells. Mr. Sowerby figures and describes\r\n_O. giganteum_ (_Min. Conch._ tab. 246), from Scotland, as exceeding\r\nseven or eight feet in length; and I discovered on the beach at\r\nBrighton, where it had probably been brought by some vessel, among\r\nballast, a fine fragment of the same species, indicating as great\r\na magnitude. Several species are figured, _Lign. 155_, to show the\r\nstructure and appearance of these fossils. The casts of the separate\r\ncells are often found. The section, _fig._ 3, from the red marble of\r\nDevonshire, beautifully displays the situation of the siphuncle, and\r\nthe lines of the septa. The shelly siphuncle, which is moniliform\r\n(_bead-like_), or dilated at each chamber, is replaced by white spar;\r\nand the membranous internal tube is filled with a dark substance,\r\nprobably molluskite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 155.

These Orthoceratites have\r\nbeen principally obtained from the Silurian limestones, at Lake Huron;\r\nthey also occur in Ireland. Mr. Stokes, who first investigated their\r\nstructure, has arranged them in a distinct genus, with the name of\r\n_Actinoceras_ (_radiated-horn_).[413]\r\n\r\n[413] See Geol. Trans, second series, vol. v. p. 708.\r\n\r\nSlabs of reddish Devonian limestone, containing Orthoceratites, may be\r\nseen in some of the pavements at Hampton Court, and in Chelsea College,\r\nwhich when wet present excellent sections of the enclosed shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 156.

In some districts, as in Yorkshire and Somersetshire,\r\nwhere the Ammonites abundantly prevail, they were noticed in very\r\nremote times. Local legends, ascribing their origin to swarms of snakes\r\nturned into stone by the prayers of some patron saint, are still\r\nextant, and are perpetuated by the name of snake-stones, by which these\r\nfossils are provincially known. The Lias, near Whitby, in Yorkshire,\r\ncontains immense numbers of two or three species, one of which (_Am.\r\nbifrons_) is figured in _Lign. 127, fig. 7_, and another in _Lign.\r\n157_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 157. Ammonites communis.\r\n\r\n_Lias._ _Whitby._]\r\n\r\nThe shells comprehended in this family are either spiral, involute,\r\narched, or straight; their septa are deeply lobed, and have the margins\r\nfoliated. The siphuncle is dorsal, as shown by the notch in the cast,\r\n_Lign. 156, fig. 3a_. Several hundred species have been described;\r\nthey are divided into genera which are characterized by essential\r\nmodifications in the direction of the spire, and the inflections of the\r\nsepta. Thus, in the _Ammonites_, _Lign. 156_, the spire is involute,\r\nand all the turns contiguous; in _Crioceras_ (_curved-horn_), _Lign.\r\n160, fig. 2_, evolute; in _Scaphites_, incurved at both extremities,\r\n_Lign. 162_; _Hamites_, bent like a siphon, or hook, _Lign. 161,\r\nfig. 1_; _Turrilites_, spiral, round a vertical axis, _Lign. 163_;\r\nand in _Baculites_, straight, _Lign. 161, fig. 2_. New genera are\r\ncontinually being added, to embrace modifications of structure which\r\nappear to be too important for specific distinctions. I will endeavour\r\nto render this arrangement more clear to the student by the following\r\ndefinitions.\r\n\r\nA straight tube, or horn, of an elongated conical figure, tapering to\r\na point, and having its cavity divided by transverse partitions, which\r\nsepta are not straight, but undulated, and their edges, which fit into\r\nthe walls of the tube, deeply wrinkled, and the whole series pierced\r\nby a pipe running along near the outer margin, would be the model of\r\nthe shell termed _Baculites_, _Lign. 161, fig. 2_, (_Bd._ pl. xliv.\r\n_fig._ 5;) which may be regarded as a straight Ammonite. A similar\r\nshell, gently arched or curved, would be a _Toxoceras_, _Lign. 160,\r\nfig. 1_; the same tube, bent upon itself, like a siphon, into unequal\r\nlimbs, not contiguous, a _Hamites_, _Lign. 161_ (_Bd._ pl. xliv.\r\n_fig._ 10); bent and approximate, or anchylosed in a straight line,\r\n_Ptychoceras_, _Lign. 161, fig. 4_; partially convoluted, the whorls\r\ncontiguous, and the free end recurved, _Scaphites_, _Lign. 162_; the\r\nsame form, but the spire not contiguous, _Ancyloceras_, _Lign. 160,\r\nfig. 3_; spirally twisted around an axis, _Turrilites_, _Lign. 163_\r\n(_Bd._ pl. xliv. _fig._ 14); coiled, but the turns not touching each\r\nother, _Crioceras_, _Lign. 160, fig. 2_; lastly, coiled up in the\r\nform of a disk, all the turns being contiguous, _Ammonites_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AMMONITE.]\r\n\r\nAmmonites. _Lign. 156, 157, 158._--Shell discoidal, more or less\r\ncompressed, whorls of the spire contiguous, and often visible; septa\r\nlobed, their margins deeply sinuated; aperture symmetrical, border or\r\nlip thickened, often notched and auriculated.

The situation of the siphuncle,\r\nthe foliated or wrinkled edges of the septa, as shown in the cast,\r\n_Lign. 156, fig. 2_; and when these characters are wanting, the\r\narched ribs and elevations, as in _figs._ 1 and 3, will serve as\r\ndiscriminating features. Like the fossil Nautili, the Ammonites most\r\ncommonly occur as casts, the shell having been dissolved. Sometimes\r\nthese consist of semi-transparent calcareous spar, the cast of each\r\ncell being distinct, but held together by the interlocking of the\r\nfoliations of the septa; such examples are of great beauty and interest\r\n(see _Bd._ pl. xlii. figs. 2, 3); they most frequently occur in the\r\nlimestones of the Oolite. The siphuncle is often preserved, even in\r\nthe chalk specimens, in which all traces of the shell are lost. In a\r\nlarge Ammonite from, near Lewes, not only the shelly siphuncle remains,\r\nbut even the internal membranous tube, converted into dark molluskite.\r\nSeparate portions of similar siphuncles occur in the chalk, and have\r\nbeen mistaken for tubular shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 158. Ammonites Jason. 1/2 _nat._\r\n\r\n_Oxford Clay, Trowbridge, Wilts._\r\n\r\n_a._--Lateral processes of the margins of the aperture.]\r\n\r\nThe outer lip, or margin of the aperture, is occasionally found entire.\r\nIn some species there is a dorsal process, as in a very common Chalk\r\nAmmonite (_A. varians_, _Lign. 156, fig. 1_), which extends far\r\nbeyond the margin; in other species, from the Oxford Clay, there are\r\nlong, narrow, lateral appendages, (_Lign. 158_). In the collection of\r\nS. P. Pratt, Esq., there is a small Ammonite, from the Inferior Oolite\r\nof Normandy, in which these processes meet over the aperture, leaving\r\nonly a circular aperture towards the back of the shell (where the\r\nsiphuncle of the animal would be situated) and a narrow fissure on the\r\nside next the involute spire. The specimen is unique, and can scarcely\r\nbe regarded as a normal form.[414] (Mr. Woodward.)\r\n\r\n[414] M. Steenstrup has described a species of _Purpura_, which at\r\nthe close of its life shuts up the aperture of its shell, with the\r\nexception of the respiratory siphon.--_Mr. Woodward._\r\n\r\nFrom the small size of the cells of the Ammonites, particularly in\r\nthose species which are of a depressed or flattened form, it was\r\nlong doubted whether the outer chamber could have been sufficiently\r\ncapacious to contain the body of the animal; and it was supposed that\r\nthese shells were internal, like the recent _Spirula_, or _Crosier_.\r\nBut Dr. Buckland has clearly demonstrated, that the outer cell of the\r\nAmmonite, if restricted in breadth, is sufficiently ample in length to\r\nhave contained the soft parts of a Cephalopod, equal in magnitude to\r\nthe largest known specimens, its proportion to the chambered part being\r\nas considerable as in the Nautilus. The outer chamber often occupies\r\nmore than half, and in some instances the entire circumference of the\r\nouter whorl (see _Bd._ pl. xxxvi.).\r\n\r\nIn certain argillaceous deposits, as the Galt, and the clays of the\r\nLias, Ammonites with the shell preserved are abundant; generally\r\nthe outer opaque layer is wanting, or adheres to the matrix when a\r\nspecimen is removed, leaving only the internal nacreous, or pearly\r\ncoat. Folkstone, on the coast of Kent, is celebrated for examples of\r\nthis kind, which may easily be collected from the Galt, which forms\r\nthe base of the cliffs, at Eastware Bay. Watchett, in Somersetshire,\r\nis equally rich in the pearly Ammonites of the Lias; entire layers of\r\nthese beautiful organic remains occur in the limestones and in the\r\nshale exposed at low water.[415]\r\n\r\n[415] A splendid group of these Ammonites may be seen in the Gallery of\r\nFossils at the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the Ammonite is generally thinner and more delicate than\r\nthat of the Nautilus. However thin these shells may be, they are\r\npossessed of great strength of structure. Not only is the shell one\r\ncontinuous _arch_, but it is moreover provided with transverse arches\r\nor corrugated _ribs_, which, like the flutings on metal pencil-cases,\r\nand _corrugated sheet-iron_, greatly strengthen the thin material.\r\nThese ribs are further subdivided, so as to multiply supports as the\r\nconvexity of the shell enlarges, in a manner somewhat similar to the\r\n_groin-work_ of vaulted roofs. The spines, tubercles, and bosses, which\r\noften arise from the ribs, are so many additions to the strength of\r\nthe latter. The sides of the shell are also supported by the transverse\r\nplates forming the _septa_, or divisions of the chambers, and, as\r\nthese plates are very sinuous where they meet the sides of the shell,\r\nthey distribute their support over a considerable portion of the\r\nsurface.[416] These complicated edges of the _septa_ form the delicate\r\nand intricate lines of foliation (_sutures_) seen on the casts of\r\nAmmonites (_Lign. 156, fig. 2_), Baculites (_Lign. 161, fig. 3_),\r\nHamites, &c. In some species the shell is thick and dense, as in the\r\nAmmonites of the Kimmeridge Clay near Aylesbury, in which one species\r\n(_Ammonites biplex_, _Min. Conch._ pl. ccxciii.) in particular abounds,\r\nand is very generally invested with the shell, as perfect as if recent.\r\nThe same Ammonite occurs in the Portland limestone above, in the state\r\nof casts, without any vestige of the shell. In some strata the shell is\r\nreplaced by calcareous spar; in others by silex or flint.[417] In the\r\npyritous clays and shales of the Lias, the shell and all its delicate\r\ninternal mechanism are coated with or replaced by brilliant sulphuret\r\nof iron, forming the most exquisite natural electrotype imaginable.\r\nPolished vertical sections of these fossils often exhibit the inner\r\ncells filled with transparent white calcareous spar; sometimes with\r\ngroups of crystals of sulphate of lime. The Ammonites of the Galt,\r\nand of the Kimmeridge Clay, are also frequently imbued with the same\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\n[416] See Bd. i. p. 339, &c.\r\n\r\n[417] See an admirable figure of a chalcedonic specimen, exhibiting the\r\nfoliated septa of an Ammonite, _Bd._ pl. xli.\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred identified species of Ammonite in the\r\nBritish strata, ranging through all the secondary formations; they have\r\nnot been found in the Tertiary deposits. They vary in size from half an\r\ninch to four feet in diameter.[418]\r\n\r\n[418] I have seen imprints of the large Chalk Ammonite, _A. peramplus_\r\n(Min. Conch. pl. ccclvii.), on the shore off Rottingdean, and Beachy\r\nHead, which indicated even larger proportions.\r\n\r\nCertain species are restricted to particular formations, and are\r\ntherefore oftentimes of essential aid in determining the relations of a\r\ndeposit; for example, the _Galt_ contains several species not found in\r\nthe upper division of the Chalk; and in the Chalk-maid are species that\r\nhave not been discovered in other strata. Certain Ammonites of the Lias\r\nare peculiar to that formation (as _A. Walcottii_, _Lign. 127, fig.\r\n7_, p. 397; and _A. communis_, _Lign. 157_). Ammonites of species allied\r\nto those of our Middle and Lower Oolites have been discovered in strata\r\nin the Himalaya mountains, several thousand feet above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 159.

CERATITES. CRIOCERAS.]\r\n\r\nGoniatites, _Lign. 159._--From the numerous family of Ammonites, a\r\nseparation has been made of a large division, in which the margins\r\nof the septa are not deeply notched or foliated, and are destitute of\r\nlateral crenatures or denticulations, so that their outline always\r\npresents a continued uninterrupted line. The siphuncle is relatively\r\nsmall. The last or outer cell of the shell extends beyond one turn\r\nof the chambered part. The back is occasionally keeled, but in most\r\nspecies is round. In illustration of this genus, which is named\r\n_Goniatites_, I have selected two common species (_Lign. 159_) from the\r\nCarboniferous limestone, and annexed outlines of a suture (the edge of\r\nthe septum) of a Goniatite, and of an Ammonite, for comparison. The\r\nimportance of the separation of this type of Ammonites into a distinct\r\ngenus, relates to the Goniatites being restricted to some of the older\r\nsedimentary strata; for although there are sixty British species, none\r\nof them have been observed above the Carboniferous system.[419]\r\n\r\n[419] _G. Henslowi_, _G. striatus_, and _G. sphæricus_, are figured in\r\n_Bd._ pl. xl.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ceratites the sutures are more simple than in the Ammonite, being\r\nlobed rather than foliated; and the alternate lobes have their edge\r\ncrenulated or finely toothed. (_C. nodosus_, _Bd._ pl. xl.) This genus\r\nis found in the Muschelkalk and the Keuper formations of Europe and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nOur limits will not permit us to extend this notice of the very\r\nnumerous family of Ammonitidæ,[420] except to offer a few illustrations\r\nof some of the modifications in form to which we have already alluded,\r\nand which will assist the student in discriminating these fossil\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[420] For further information, Dr. Buckland’s Treatise, and the\r\nrespective articles in the Penny Cyclopædia, may be referred to. Mr.\r\nWoodward’s Manual should be consulted for the classification of the\r\nfamily, and M. D’Orbigny’s Paléontologie Française for the illustration\r\nof species.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrioceras (_coiled-horn_), _Lign. 160, fig. 2._--This shell differs\r\nfrom the Ammonites in the turns of the spire being distant from each\r\nother. The siphuncle is continuous, and the septa are regularly divided\r\ninto six lobes. I have found specimens of this genus in the Chalk-marl\r\nat Hamsey, and in the White Chalk, near Lewes (_Foss. South D._ tab.\r\nxxiii. _fig._ 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 160.

It\r\nis figured and described, by the name of _Scaphites Hillsii_, in the\r\nadmirable Memoir of Dr. Fitton on the Strata below the Chalk (_Geol.\r\nTrans._ vol. iv. pl. xv.); the present genus was not then established.\r\nThe Shanklin Sand in the Isle of Wight also contains a gigantic\r\nspecies, which is figured and described by Mr. J. D. Sowerby, in the\r\n_Geol. Trans._, as _Scaphites gigas_. _Ancyloceras_ occurs also in the\r\nOolite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TOXOCERAS. HAMITES.]\r\n\r\nIn Toxoceras (_bow-horn_), _Lign. 160, fig. 1_, the shell is slightly\r\ncurved, like a horn. Two or three species of _Toxoceras_ are found\r\nat Hamsey. The tubercles, in the casts, are the bases of spines,\r\nwith which the back of the shell was armed, as I have ascertained\r\nby examples examined in the rock (see _Foss. South D._ tab. xxiii.\r\n_fig._ 1). The specimens figured of the above two genera occur in the\r\n_Neocomian_ strata of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nHamites (_hook-shaped_). _Lign. 161, fig. 1._--Shell involute,\r\nspiral, the turns not contiguous; spire irregular, elliptical; the\r\nlarge end reflected towards the spire. The term _Hamite_, proposed by\r\nthe late Mr. Parkinson, was formerly given to all the fragments of\r\nsub-cylindrical chambered shells, that were bent, or slightly hooked;\r\nand the genera _Ancyloceras_, _Toxoceras_, &c., have been separated\r\nfrom them, by M. D’Orbigny. But from fossils recently obtained from\r\nCretaceous strata in Pondicherry, and other parts of India, it seems\r\nprobable that these genera will be found to merge into each other; at\r\npresent it is convenient to keep up the distinction. The Hamites are\r\ndistinguished from Ancyloceras, which they most resemble, by their\r\nelliptical, irregular spire.\r\n\r\n\r\nPtychoceras (_folded horn_). _Lign. 161, fig. 4._--This is another\r\ngenus formed from the Hamites. The shell is bent double in the shape\r\nof a siphon, and the limbs are united together. The specimen figured is\r\nfrom the _Neocomian_ strata of the Lower Alps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 161.

At length I found the specimen, _Lign. 161, fig. 2_, which\r\nshowed the perfect aperture of a chambered shell; and afterwards I\r\nfound portions which displayed the foliated septa. (_Foss. South D._\r\ntab. xxiii. _figs._ 5, 6, 7.) The Baculite, when perfect, is elongated\r\nto a point; the septa are very numerous and foliated; the siphuncle\r\nis situated on the margin. I have a splendid specimen from the Chalk\r\nof France, (collected by _M. Alex. Brongniart_,) which is composed of\r\ndistinct casts of the cells, held together by the deep inflections of\r\ntheir margins, in the same manner as are the sparry casts of Ammonites,\r\npreviously described.[421]\r\n\r\n[421] See _Bd._ pl. xliv, _fig._ 5.\r\n\r\nThe Galt, near Folkstone, abounds in fossils of the above genera,\r\nprincipally of _Hamites_; and the nacreous substance of the shells\r\nis very often preserved. From the Chalk-marl near Dover, Southbourn,\r\nRingmer, and Southerham, near Lewes, and from Clayton, near\r\nHurstpierpoint, in Sussex, I have obtained examples of several species.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCAPHITES.]\r\n\r\nScaphites (_boat-like_). _Lign. 162._--This name was given by Mr.\r\nParkinson (_Org. Rem._ vol. iii. pl. x. See _Pict. Atlas_) to some\r\nsmall chambered shells from the Chalk and Shanklin Sand, of a boat-like\r\nform, with the inner whorls coiled up in a spire, and half hidden by\r\nthe outer chamber, which becomes contracted and recurved on itself,\r\nis destitute of septa, and terminates in an oval or transverse mouth.\r\nThe siphuncle is dorsal. An _Ancyloceras_ closely coiled would be a\r\nScaphite. Hamsey marl-pit yielded to my early researches the first\r\nScaphites discovered in the British strata, together with Turrilites,\r\nand other cephalopodous shells, previously unknown in England.[422] The\r\nScaphite is of an elliptical form, the spire and the mouth approaching\r\nclose to each other; the spire occupies about one-half of the shell.\r\nExcept the thick outer lip or margin of the aperture, which is almost\r\nconstantly found changed into pyrites, it is rarely that any vestige\r\nof the shell remains. The same mineral constitutes casts of the spiral\r\npart; and these, when separated from the other portion, might be taken\r\nfor Ammonites; see _fig._ 2. There are two varieties at Hamsey; one,\r\nwith the surface covered by fine transverse striæ, which arise singly\r\nfrom the inner margins, and bifurcate on the dorsal part; _fig._ 1. The\r\nother is also striated, but has a row of prominent ribs on the inner\r\nhalf of the broad central portion of the shell; _fig._ 4. Scaphites\r\noccur in the Upper Green Sand of Dorsetshire, and in the Chalk-marl\r\nin several places in England; and at Rouen, in France; and a large\r\nspecies, _S.

Spire sinistral, whorls\r\ncontiguous, apparent, with a perforated umbilicus. Edges of septa\r\nvery sinuous. Siphuncle continuous, situated either on the external\r\nconvexity, or near the suture at the base of the wreath.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of three species of these elegant shells rewarded my\r\nresearches in the little marl-pit at Hamsey, already noticed, and\r\nwere the first examples of the genus found in England.[423] Like the\r\nAmmonites, Scaphites, Hamites, &c. with which they are associated, the\r\nTurrilites of our Chalk-marl seldom possess any traces of their shells.\r\nThe specimens are solid and tolerably sharp casts, with occasional\r\nindications of the septa, and more rarely of the siphunculus. They\r\nvary in size from two or three inches to two feet in length; and\r\nare frequently more or less elliptical, from compression. The three\r\nspecies which generally occur in the Sussex and Kentish chalk, are _T.\r\ncostatus_, _Lign. 163, fig. 2_; _T. tuberculatus_ (_Foss. South D._\r\npl. xxiv. _fig._ 7), characterised by its four rows of tubercles; and\r\n_T. undulatus_ (_Foss. South D._ pl. xxiv. _fig._ 8), the wreaths of\r\nwhich are ornamented with plain, slightly undulated, transverse ribs.\r\nThese are all reversed, or _sinistral_ shells; that is, the spire\r\nis twisted to the left, the aperture being on the right hand of the\r\nobserver when the shell is placed on its apex, as in _fig._ 1. Several\r\nother species of Turrilites occur in the Chalk of France,[424] one of\r\nwhich, _T. catenatus_, is represented _Lign. 163, fig. 1_.\r\n\r\n[423] Sow. Min.

The largest\r\nfound in England is a specimen of _T. tuberculatus_ (_Min. Conch._ tab.\r\nlxxiv.), from Middleham, in the parish of Ringmer, near Lewes; when\r\nperfect, it must have been full two feet in length: it consists of six\r\nwreaths, the siphuncle, in the state of pyrites, appearing in three or\r\nfour; portions of the nacreous internal layer of the shell remain.[425]\r\nIn some specimens in my possession, the form of the aperture, and the\r\ntermination of the columella, are distinctly shown; as in the fine\r\nexample the last whorl of which is represented in _Lign. 164_.\r\n\r\n[425] This specimen is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 164.

(Trigonellites, _Parkinson_.) _Lign. 165._--Associated\r\nwith the remains of Ammonites in several localities, are found\r\nflattened triangular bodies, from less than an inch to an inch and a\r\nhalf in diameter, the nature of which is still somewhat problematical.\r\nA good figure is given by Mr. Parkinson of one species (_Org. Rem._\r\nvol. iii. pl. xiii. figs. 9, 10, 12. See _Pict. Atlas_), with the name\r\n_Trigonellites latus_. These bodies frequently occur in pairs and in\r\napposition, as in the specimen figured in _Lign. 165_. Their structure\r\nis cellular; one surface is slightly concave and striated, and the\r\nother covered with minute circular pores. Altogether their appearance\r\nis that of bodies enclosed in vascular integuments. It is supposed that\r\nthey are the opercula of Ammonites. These fossils are commonly found\r\nin the last or body chamber of Ammonites, in the Oxford Clay, near\r\nChippenham, the Coral Oolite of Malton, the Lias of Lyme Regis, and\r\nthe lithographic limestone of Solenhofen. M. Ewald states that they\r\nmay be found in the Chalk _Scaphites_ by making a longitudinal section\r\nof the body chamber: but I have not succeeded in detecting them in the\r\nexamples from the chalk-marl which I have broken up for that purpose.\r\nAs these bodies (alluded to by authors as _Trigonellites_, _Aptychus_,\r\n_Munsteria_, &c.) will probably come under the observation of the\r\ncollector, especially among the fossils of the Kimmeridge Clay, these\r\nremarks are introduced to suggest diligent research, in the hope that\r\nthe origin of these fossils may at length be discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 165.

Their geological distribution\r\nis alike replete with phenomena of an important character. In the\r\nLower Palæozoic (Lower and Upper Silurian) strata, the chambered\r\nmollusks belong (with a very few doubtful exceptions) to the\r\nNautilidæ, namely, Nautilus, Lituites, Cyrtoceras, Orthoceras, &c.\r\nThe Devonian and Carboniferous systems contain Nautilus, Clymenia,\r\nGyroceras, Cyrtoceras, and Orthoceras, together with a peculiar group\r\nof Ammonitidæ, the _Goniatites_. The Trias in general is extremely\r\npoor in Cephalopoda; the Permian group affording but two species of\r\nNautilus, and the Muschelkalk two other species: but, in addition to\r\nthese, the Muschelkalk contains Ceratites, which is a genus peculiar\r\nto the Triassic group, and chiefly abounds in the St. Cassian beds (in\r\nthe Austrian Alps), where it is accompanied by Nautilus, Orthoceras,\r\nAmmonites, and Goniatites. In the Lias and Oolite Nautili abound,\r\nand we meet for the first time with Belemnites. The same families,\r\nviz. Nautilidæ, Ammonitidæ, and Belemnitidæ, prevail throughout the\r\nCretaceous strata. The Tertiary formations contain a few Nautilidæ\r\nonly; no vestiges of the Ammonitidæ and true Belemnitidæ, which, as\r\nwe have seen, swarmed in the ancient seas, are perceptible, while\r\nin the existing oceans, the _Nautilus_ and _Spirula_ are the sole\r\nrepresentatives of the numerous shell-bearing cephalopoda of the\r\nancient geological eras. Thus, the Nautilidæ extend from the oldest to\r\nthe newest fossiliferous strata, the genus being still in existence:\r\nthe Ammonitidæ, on the other hand, though less ancient in origin, do\r\nnot pass beyond the limits of the cretaceous epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following tabular arrangement these facts are placed in a more\r\ndistinct point of view:--\r\n\r\n         _Tabular View of the Distribution of Cephalopoda\r\n                  through the Geological Epochs._\r\n\r\n  _Existing Genera_\r\n    { Argonauta.   }  Octopoda.                            }\r\n    { Octopus, &c. }                                       }\r\n    {                                                      }\r\n    { Loligo, Cranchia.           }(_Teuthidæ_).}          }\r\n    { Sepiola, Onychoteuthis, &c. }             }          } Dibranchiata.\r\n    {                                           }Decapoda. }\r\n    { Sepia (_Sepiadæ_).                        }          }\r\n    {                                           }          }\r\n    { Spirula.                                  }          }\r\n    {\r\n    { Nautilus (_Nautilidæ_).

The addition of a new transverse plate within the\r\ncoiled shell added a new air-chamber, larger than the preceding one, to\r\ncounterbalance the increase of weight that attended the growth of the\r\nshell and body of these animals.\" (_Bd._ p. 380.)\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the Nautilus, and its congeners, among the earliest\r\ntraces of the animal kingdom, and their continuance throughout the\r\nimmense periods during which the family of Ammonitidæ was created,\r\nflourished, and became extinct, and the existence of species of the\r\nsame genus at the present time, are facts too remarkable to have\r\nescaped the notice even of those who are not professed cultivators of\r\ngeological science; and I am induced to quote the following beautiful\r\nlines, by Mrs. Howitt, to impress this interesting phenomenon more\r\nstrongly on the mind of the youthful reader.[428]\r\n\r\n[428] The poetess has, however, not been literally accurate regarding\r\nthe Nautilus and its habits, nor as to the formation of stratified\r\nrocks, but has given a romantic rather than a scientifically correct\r\nview of this interesting Cephalopod, and of the disappearance of its\r\ncongener. The young reader must, therefore, remember that the Nautilus\r\nsometimes _floats_, but _never sails_; and that the whole race of\r\nAmmonites _died out_ in course of time, and were not annihilated by\r\nconvulsive movements of earth and sea.\r\n\r\n\"TO THE NAUTILUS.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou didst laugh at sun and breeze,\r\n    In the new created seas;\r\n    Thou wast with the reptile broods\r\n    In the old sea solitudes,\r\n    Sailing in the new-made light,\r\n    With the curl’d-up Ammonite.\r\n    Thou surviv’dst the awful shock,\r\n    Which turn’d the ocean bed to rock,\r\n    And changed its myriad living swarms,\r\n    To the marble’s veined forms.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou wast there, thy little boat,\r\n    Airy voyager! kept afloat,\r\n    O’er the waters wild and dismal,\r\n    O’er the yawning gulfs abysmal;\r\n    Amid wreck and overturning,\r\n    Rock-imbedding, heaving, burning,\r\n    Mid the tumult and the stir;\r\n    Thou, most ancient mariner,\r\n    In that pearly boat of thine,\r\n    Sail’dst upon the troubled brine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL CEPHALOPODA.]\r\n\r\nOn the Collection of British Fossil Cephalopoda.--In the Tertiary\r\nformations of England, the remains of but seven species of Nautilus\r\n(comprising Aturia) have been noticed; the large species (_N.\r\nimperialis_) is the most common. These are generally in a good state of\r\npreservation, and only require the careful removal of the surrounding\r\nclay or marl. When pyrites largely enters into the composition of the\r\nspecimens, the investing matrix can seldom be effectually cleared off:\r\nif the outer surface, and general form, be not well displayed, breaking\r\nthe specimen will often expose the inner cells, with the siphunculus,\r\nin a beautiful state. The _Nautilus imperialis_ is occasionally\r\nimbedded in the septaria of the Isle of Sheppey, and of Bognor and\r\nBracklesham, on the Sussex coast. Sections of such examples, in the\r\nvertical direction of the enclosed shell, afford, when polished, very\r\nbrilliant and interesting fossils; the septa and the shelly tube of the\r\nsiphunculus are often preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopods of the Cretaceous formation, with the exception of\r\nthose in the argillaceous strata of the Galt, are generally destitute\r\nof their shells, and only occur in the state of casts; and the\r\nChalk Nautili are liable to separate at the divisions of the septa,\r\nand an entire series of the casts of the chambers may sometimes be\r\nobtained, so as to display the entire form of the original shell. The\r\nAmmonites of the White Chalk, although mere casts, yet retain their\r\nconfiguration, the foliated margins of the septa dove-tailing them\r\ntogether. I have already mentioned that search should be made along the\r\nback of these specimens for the siphuncle, the shelly tube of which\r\nis sometimes well defined. In the Chalk-marl the casts are sharper\r\nthan in the White Chalk, and generally of a deep ochreous colour,\r\nwith the lines of the sinuous septa clearly defined. The siphuncle\r\nis occasionally preserved in pyrites, in the Ammonites, Nautili,\r\nTurrilites, and Scaphites; and the outer lip or margin of the mouth, or\r\naperture, of the latter, and of the Ammonites, is frequently replaced\r\nby the same mineral.\r\n\r\nThe Ammonites, Hamites, &c. of the Galt have their pearly coat\r\nremaining, but this investment is extremely delicate; and although when\r\nfirst removed from the marl it is beautifully iridescent, the vivid\r\nhues are very evanescent, and the shell becomes opaque and of a light\r\nfawn colour. Very commonly the shell flakes off, wholly or in part,\r\nleaving a cast of indurated pyritous marl. I have preserved specimens\r\nwith the shell many years, by applying a thin coat of mastic varnish\r\nwith a soft camel-hair pencil, before the marl had become dry, and\r\nwhile the shells were entire. The Galt Ammonites, like the Nautili of\r\nthe London Clay, are often invested with pyrites, and have the inner\r\ncells and siphuncle well preserved.\r\n\r\nThe argillaceous strata of the Oolite and Lias contain Ammonites, &c.\r\nin much the same state of mineralization as those of the Galt. The\r\nKimmeridge Clay, in some localities, particularly around Aylesbury (and\r\nespecially at Hartwell Park, the seat of Dr. Lee), abounds in Ammonites\r\nwith the shell as perfect and beautiful as if just dredged up from\r\nthe sea. But, like the fossils of the Galt, few of the specimens are\r\ndurable; although in many examples the shell may be preserved by the\r\napplication of mastic varnish. The most common Ammonite at Hartwell\r\nis _A. biplex_ (_Sow. Min. Conch._), which varies from three inches\r\nto one foot in diameter; the surface is covered by very strong ribs\r\nthat encircle the whorls. The shell is thick, and composed of several\r\nlaminæ.[429]\r\n\r\n[429] According to the observations of my son, the outer layers,\r\nwhen highly magnified, present an appearance of opaque areolæ, with\r\nirregular radiating fibres; the inner laminæ are covered with minute\r\npores, apparently the orifices of tubuli, some of which are arranged\r\nsingly in crescents, and others are confluent, like short strands\r\nof beads. I mention the fact to direct attention to the microscopic\r\nexamination of the structure of these splendid fossils.\r\n\r\nThe sparry casts of the separate cells of Ammonites which occur in some\r\nof the calcareous beds of the Oolite, will not fail to be observed by\r\nthe collector. It is convenient to preserve such specimens either on a\r\ntray or board, in which a groove is made for their reception, or in a\r\nmould of gutta percha.\r\n\r\nIn collecting _Belemnitidæ_, the caution already given, of examining\r\nthe surrounding clay or marl, must not be disregarded; the student\r\nshould remember, that traces of the soft parts of the animals, even\r\nof mere impressions of the body and head, with the tentacula and\r\ntheir acetabula, or little horny rings and hooks, are more important\r\nthan the most splendid examples of the spathose durable osselet. The\r\nguards should be selected with especial reference to their containing\r\nthe phragmocone (see _Lign. 141, fig. 2_), or chambered conical\r\nshell, in the alveolus or cavity of the upper and larger end. An\r\napparently worthless fragment of a Belemnite will often be found to\r\npossess this part of the structure, as in the example figured, which,\r\nuntil fractured longitudinally, had been thrown by among useless\r\nduplicates. The search for the remains of the fossil naked Cephalopoda,\r\nas the Teuthidæ and Sepiadæ, and their ink-bags, must be made in a\r\nlike cautious manner. In the Lias marls, the ink-bag and its duct is\r\noften found partially covered by a pellicle of nacre, without any\r\ntrace of the other parts of the animal. A reference to Dr. Buckland’s\r\nplates (_Bd._ pl. xxviii. xxix) will familiarize the student with the\r\nappearance of these fossil remains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL CEPHALOPODA.]\r\n\r\nA FEW BRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\n  Abingdon, Berks.

It comprehends six classes; namely--\r\n\r\n1. Annelata, or Annelida; _i. e._ formed of rings; comprising the\r\nRed-blooded Worms.\r\n\r\n2. Myriapoda; as the Centipede.\r\n\r\n3. Cirripedia; _i. e._ having curled-feet; as the _Balanus_ and _Lepas_\r\n(Barnacle).\r\n\r\n4. Crustacea; as the Crab, Lobster, and Water Flea.\r\n\r\n5. Arachnida; Mites, Scorpions, and Spiders.\r\n\r\n6. Insecta, or Insects.\r\n\r\nOf the first, third, fourth, and sixth of these classes, remains occur\r\nin the British strata, some being referable to existing, but the\r\ngreater part to extinct species and genera. I propose to describe a few\r\nillustrative examples of the fossils belonging to each Class.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnelida.--This name is given to a class of _Articulata_, consisting of\r\nworms, whose bodies are formed of little rings, or annular segments,\r\nand which have red blood; as the Leech, Earth-worm, &c. Some are\r\nnaked (the _Dorsibranchiata_ and _Abranchiata_), and move with great\r\ncelerity; as the _Gordius_, or Hair-worm, and the _Nereis_, so frequent\r\non the sands of the sea-shore. Others have shelly coverings (the\r\n_Tubicolæ_), as the _Serpula_, and are sedentary, or fixed to other\r\nbodies. The soft bodies of certain species are protected by a coat, or\r\ntube, formed by the agglutination of sand, or other foreign substances,\r\nas in the _Sabella_ (_Lign. 123, fig. 6_, p. 385).\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of the testaceous Annelides are very abundant in\r\nsome deposits; and even the naked, flexible, soft-bodied forms have\r\nleft proofs of their existence in some of the most ancient sedimentary\r\nrocks. Traces of nine species, belonging to five genera of these soft,\r\nnaked Annelides, have been observed in the Silurian strata of Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 166. Fossil impression of Nereis. _Silurian\r\nstrata._\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Miss Murray._)\r\n\r\nNereites Cambrensis. (_Murch. Sil. Syst._) _Llampeter._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL NEREIS. SERPULA. CIRRIPEDIA.]\r\n\r\nThe first notice of these remarkable remains appeared in the invaluable\r\nwork of Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian System.[430] The living\r\nspecies of Nereis (_Dorsibranchiate_) are free, agile animals, having\r\na distinct head, provided with either eyes or antennæ, or both; they\r\nare the most perfect in structure of all the Annelides. The fossil\r\nrepresented in _Lign. 166_ indicates that the body of the original\r\nwas composed of about one hundred and twenty segments; the feet were\r\nhalf the length of a segment of the body; and the _cirri_ of the feet\r\nwere longer than such segment. A more slender species, (_Nereites\r\nSedgwickii_,) the body consisting of a greater number of segments, is\r\nalso figured and described by Sir It. I. Murchison. Other impressions\r\nin the same stone resemble those that would be produced by smooth\r\nAnnelides (_Abranchiate_) related to the _Gordius_, or Hair-worm.[431]\r\n\r\n[430] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 699.\r\n\r\n[431] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 701, pl. xxvii.; and M’Coy, Cambridge Pal.\r\nFoss. p. 128, pl. 1. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpula.--The animals of this genus are sedentary or fixed, having\r\ncalcareous tubes or shells, but to which they have no muscular\r\nattachment. They have plumose or arborescent gills affixed to the\r\nanterior part of the body. The shelly tubes of the _Serpulæ_ are\r\nconstantly seen on our coasts, encrusting stones, rocks, shells,\r\nsea-weeds, &c., and may be known by their contorted or twisted forms.\r\nThere are a hundred and fifty British fossil Tubicolæ. A large species\r\nhas been discovered in the Silurian rocks (_Murch. Sil. Syst._ pl. v.\r\n_fig._ 1); several occur in the Carboniferous, Oolitic, and Cretaceous,\r\nand many in the Tertiary strata. In the Upper Chalk, a smooth tortuous\r\n_Serpula_ is not uncommon (_S. plexus_, _Min. Conch_, tab. 598);\r\nit occurs in masses several inches long. But I have not observed\r\neither in the Chalk, or in any other deposit, indications of banks of\r\n_Serpulidæ_, like those now in progress off the Bermudas, and which\r\nresemble coral-reefs in their solidity and extent.\r\n\r\nCirripedia.--These animals have a soft body, enveloped in a membrane,\r\nwhich in some genera is protected only by a horny sheath, but in\r\ngeneral is enclosed in a shell composed of various calcareous\r\nplates.[432] They have six pairs of feet, terminating in long,\r\nslender, articulated tentacula, furnished with cilia, and coiled up\r\nlike tendrils at the extremities near the mouth. The name of the class\r\n(_curled-feet_) has originated from the appearance presented by the\r\ncurled tentacula when projecting from the oval aperture of the shell.\r\nThe testaceous Cirripedes or _Barnacles_ are divided into two groups;\r\nnamely, the _sessile_, or those which in their adult state are fixed by\r\nthe base to other bodies, (Balanidæ,) as the Acorn-shell, or _Balanus_;\r\nand the _pedunculated_, which have a process of attachment, peduncle\r\nor stem, (Lepadidæ,) as the Duck-barnacle, or _Lepas_. But the young\r\nanimals of these genera have powerful locomotive organs, and are\r\ncapable of swimming, by sudden jerks, like some of the crustaceans,\r\nto which class, especially in this stage of their existence, they\r\nclosely approach. But after a short period of freedom, the young\r\nCirripede fixes itself in some locality suitable to its economy, and\r\nrapidly undergoes the transformation which results in the sessile adult\r\nBarnacle or Lepas.[433]\r\n\r\n[432] Until within the last few years the valves of the _Cirripedes_\r\nhave been generally figured and described in works on Conchology as\r\nbeing allied to the _Mollusca_.\r\n\r\n[433] See Mr. C. Darwin’s admirable Monograph on the Cirripedia,\r\npublished by the Ray Society, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nBalanus. _Lign. 167, fig. 1.3_--The shell of this sessile Cirripede\r\nis of a conical shape and cellular structure. It consists of a thick\r\nplate at the base, or place of attachment; of a series of plates,\r\nunited by sutures, arranged around the body of the animal, and called\r\n_parietal_ valves; and of pieces termed _opercular_ valves, by which\r\nthe aperture is closed. The shell of the _Balanus_, so common on the\r\nrocks of our shores, and on every pile and pier within reach of the\r\ntide, is composed of six parietal, and four opercular valves. The\r\nfossil _Balanus_, _Lign. 167. fig. 1_, is from the Crag, a formation\r\ncontaining many shells of this genus: in this example, the six parietal\r\nplates of the conical shell only remain, but in some specimens the\r\nopercular valves are also preserved. There are about twelve species\r\nof Balanus in the Crag; but none have been found either in the older\r\nTertiary, or in the secondary rocks of England. In the newer _Pliocene_\r\ndeposits of the Sub-Apennines, and of North America, several species\r\nare common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 167.

In _Pollicipes_ and _Scalpellum_\r\nthere are small calcareous plates covering the junction of the body\r\nwith the peduncle. Detached valves of several species of these two\r\ngenera are met with in the Chalk, Galt, and Shanklin Sand, of Kent\r\nand Sussex; and three species have been found in the English Tertiary\r\nbeds.[435] The valves of these fossil Cirripedes are most usually\r\nfound in a disconnected state (_Lign._ 167, _figs._ 3 and 4); but\r\nthe Tertiary _Scalpellum quadratum_ is sometimes better preserved;\r\nand Mr. Morris has described a most beautiful group of _Pollicipes_\r\n(_P. concinnus_), attached to an Ammonite, from the Oxford Clay. Mr\r\nWetherell, of Highgate, has also discovered, in the Upper Chalk, near\r\nRochester, an almost perfect Cirripede, named by Mr. G. B. Sowerby,\r\njun., _Loricula pulchella_ (_Lign. 167, fig. 2_), and lately more\r\nfully described in detail by Mr. Darwin.[436]\r\n\r\n[435] See Mr. Darwin’s Monograph of the Fossil _Lepadidæ_,\r\nPalæontographical Society, 1851.\r\n\r\n[436] Monograph of the Fossil Lepadidæ, p. 81, pl. v.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrustacea.--The animals whose fossil remains we have now to consider,\r\nare characterised by their crustaceous external integument or shell,\r\nwhich is disposed in segments, more or less distinct, the annular\r\nportions supporting articulated limbs or appendages. They are aquatic,\r\nfree, locomotive beings, and possess distinct _branchiæ_, or organs\r\nfitted for aquatic respiration. The Crab and Lobster are examples of\r\nthose tribes in which the external crust is calcareous, and \"coloured\r\nby a pigmental substance, diffused more or less irregularly through\r\nit; and is formed upon and by a vascular organized integument, or\r\ncorium, which is lined by the smooth serous membrane of the visceral\r\ncavities.\" (_Owen._) The subdivisions of this class have relation\r\nto the forms, combinations, and proportions of the primary rings or\r\nsegments of the external crust or integument, but it will not be\r\nrequisite for our present purpose to enter upon this department of the\r\nsubject. It may, however, be necessary to mention, that in the normal\r\ntype of Crustaceans, the integument consists of twenty-one rings or\r\nsegments, which form the three regions into which the body is divided;\r\nnamely, the head or _cephalic_, the _thoracic_, and the _abdominal_;\r\neach of which is assumed to consist of seven rings, although some of\r\nthese are generally anchylosed, and form but one segment; and even\r\nthe three regions are occasionally more or less blended together.\r\nThe cephalic portion of the crust contains the principal organs of\r\nsense, and the commencement of the digestive apparatus, and includes\r\nthe masticatory appendages. The _thoracic_ portion is formed of the\r\nrings to which the extremities serving for locomotion are attached:\r\nand, together with the cephalic, contains almost all the viscera. The\r\nconsolidation of the rings or segments takes place most generally in\r\nthe cephalic, and next in frequency in the thoracic; and but rarely\r\noccurs in the abdominal region. These animals possess organs of sight\r\nvariously modified, and in some species highly complicated; some have\r\nsmooth or simple eyes (_stemmata_), and others compound eyes, like\r\nthose of insects, with distinct facets. In one grand division (called\r\n_Edriopthalmia_), the eyes are sessile and immovable; in the other\r\n(_Podopthalmia_), they are supported upon moveable stems or peduncles.\r\nThese few remarks on the organization of the recent crustaceans are\r\nrequired, to make our description of the fossil remains intelligible\r\nto the general reader. As the shell, or calcareous integument, even\r\nin those species in which it is very dense and thick, is moulded\r\nupon the soft parts it envelopes, the experienced naturalist is able,\r\nfrom its configuration alone, to obtain certain conclusions as to\r\nthe form, size, and position of the contained viscera; and, as these\r\nanimals annually shed their solid case and acquire a new one, which\r\nis moulded on the soft parts, the form and relative situation of the\r\ninternal organs must necessarily be faithfully represented by the\r\nexternal integument, even when it has acquired its greatest degree of\r\nconsolidation; thus the regions of the stomach, heart, branchiæ or\r\nrespiratory organs, &c. may be distinctly traced on the external shell.\r\nHence the fossil carapaces may afford important data regarding the\r\nstructure and economy of the extinct species. M. Desmarest[437] was the\r\nfirst naturalist who successfully applied this _phrenological method_\r\nto the investigation of the fossil crustaceans.\r\n\r\n[437] Histoire Naturelle des Crustacés Fossiles; par MM. Alex.\r\nBrongniart et Desmarest. 1 tom. 4to. Paris, 1822.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of Crustaceans consist of the calcareous covering\r\nor carapace, with the articulated extremities, and, rarely, the\r\njaws and antennæ. For the most part, the specimens are mutilated,\r\nand present only portions of the carapace, abdominal segments, and\r\ndetached claws; but in strata composed of very fine detritus, such as\r\nthe cream-coloured limestones of Solenhofen and Pappenheim, examples\r\noften occur in the most beautiful state of preservation, appearing as\r\nif the animals had been carefully embalmed in a soft paste, that had\r\nquickly consolidated around them, and preserved them without mutilation\r\nor blemish. In some examples, even the colour of the original remains.\r\nThe specimens found in hard limestones and coarse conglomerates are\r\ngenerally mutilated, and, as the under surface of the carapace, and\r\nthe sternal plates to which the legs are attached, present more\r\nirregularity than the dorsal portion of the shell, they are firmly\r\nimpacted in the stone, so as to render the development of some of the\r\nmost important characters difficult, if not impossible. The antennæ\r\nand claws are often separated, or altogether wanting; the most common\r\nrelics being the pincers and the carapace, or united cephalo-thoracic\r\nsegments. The substance of the shell, which in the recent state\r\nconsists of phosphate and carbonate of lime, with gelatine or\r\ncartilage, is commonly a friable carbonate of lime, tinged with oxide\r\nof iron. These remarks apply more particularly to the crabs, lobsters,\r\nshrimps, prawns, &c. Numerous species of the smaller crustaceans, as\r\nthe_ Cypris_, and the extinct family of _Trilobites_, occur in myriads,\r\nand, in some formations, are the principal constituent of deposits of\r\ngreat thickness and extent.\r\n\r\nThe remains of this class have been found throughout the vast series of\r\nthe fossiliferous strata. Extinct forms appear in prodigious numbers in\r\nthe most ancient formations, and are succeeded by genera which approach\r\nmore nearly to the more highly organized crustaceans. The Crab and\r\nLobster tribes are represented by certain species in the Lias, Oolite,\r\nand Chalk; while in many of the Tertiary strata the existing types\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nThe London Clay, in the Isle of Sheppey, yields many beautiful examples\r\nof the higher order of crustaceans, as the Crab, Lobster, &c. In the\r\nChalk these remains are more rare, but a few fine specimens have been\r\nobtained. On the Continent, certain localities are extremely rich\r\nin these remains. Upwards of sixty species were discovered by Count\r\nMünster in the Jura limestone, at Solenhofen; and the Muschelkalk\r\nof Germany has yielded several extinct genera. The beautiful state\r\nin which these fossils occur, is exemplified in the specimen from\r\nSolenhofen, figured in the frontispiece of this work; _Pl. I. fig. 2_.\r\n\r\nFossil Crabs.--Of the _brachyurous_, or short-tailed, crustaceans,\r\nof which the common Crab is an example, and of the _Anomura_\r\n(abnormal-tailed), there are remains of several genera in the Tertiary\r\ndeposits. The Isle of Sheppey is the most productive locality in\r\nEngland. The carapaces of several kinds occur in the septaria and\r\nnodules of indurated clay; the chelate hand-claws (_pincer-claws_)\r\nare often found detached, and sometimes in connexion with the shield.\r\nThe most numerous specimens are referable to two species. One of them\r\n(_Cancer Leachii_) is from two to three inches wide, and has a convex\r\nshell, the surface of which is covered by minute punctations, with\r\nthree tubercles on each anterior lateral margin.[438] The carapace of\r\nthe other species is more distinctly lobed, and studded with aculeated\r\nor spiny tubercles; it is named _C. tuberculatus_.[439]\r\n\r\n[438] Hist. Nat. Crust. Foss. pl. viii. figs. 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n[439] König, Icones Foss. Sect. _fig._ 54. These two species are now\r\nreferred to the genus _Zanthopsis_.\r\n\r\nA species of Crab, characterised by its relatively large claws, is\r\ncommon in the soft Tertiary limestone of Malta; and examples, in a fine\r\nstate of preservation, are often seen in cabinets; see _Wond._ p. 251.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that vestiges of more than one genus of brachyurous\r\ncrustaceans have been observed in the British Secondary formations;\r\nnamely, the _Podopilumnus Fittoni_ (M‘Coy), from the Greensand of Lyme\r\nRegis: but several small species belonging to the anomurous group have\r\nbeen found in the Galt.\r\n\r\nIn the _Galt_ at Ringmer, a village near Lewes, I discovered, many\r\nyears since, four or five species of small crustaceans, which are\r\nfigured and described, _Foss. South D._ pl. xxiv.; their natural\r\nrelations were pointed out to me by the late eminent naturalist, Dr.\r\nLeach. Specimens of two of the species have since been collected at\r\nFolkstone, but as these are only the carapaces, no additional light has\r\nbeen thrown upon the structure of the originals.\r\n\r\nThe smallest species consists of the carapace or cephalo-thoracic\r\nsegments, united into a transversely obovate, obscurely trilobate\r\nshell, the surface of which is covered with minute irregular papillæ;\r\nwith four tubercles on each lateral portion, and an irregularly\r\ntuberculated dorsal ridge (see _Lign. 168, fig. 1, 1a._); it\r\nprobably belongs to the genus Etyus; and I have named it _Etyus\r\nMartini_, in honour of my friend, P. J. Martin, Esq., author of several\r\nexcellent Memoirs on the Geology of Western Sussex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 168.

The tail is folded under the\r\nbody when the animal is in repose. They have ten legs, the anterior\r\npair _chelate_ (_with pincers_), the others terminating in an acute\r\nelongated nail or claw. The fossils consist of the carapace, and one\r\nexample possesses the inferior or thoracic plates and the remains of\r\nthe bases of some of the legs (see _Lign. 168, fig. 3a_).\r\n\r\nNotopocorystes Stokesii. _Lign. 168, fig. 2._--The carapace is relatively\r\nwider than in most species of this genus; is has a strong dorsal ridge\r\nof irregular oblong tubercles; the union of the cephalic and thoracic\r\nsegments is marked by a transverse undulated groove; there are three or\r\nfour tubercles on the surface of each lateral portion of the former,\r\nand one on each of the latter. The whole surface is finely granulated.\r\nThe openings left by the attachment of the peduncles of the eye remain.\r\n\r\nNotopocorystes Broderipii. _Lign. 168, fig. 3._--This species, like\r\nthe former, has a transverse undulated furrow, indicating the union of\r\nthe cephalic with the thoracic segments; the dorsal ridge is smooth,\r\nand there are two tubercles on each lateral cephalic portion of the\r\nshield. The carapace is longitudinally ovate, much depressed, with\r\nthree sharp points directed forwards on each margin of the anterior\r\npart: the whole surface is finely granulated. In the specimen _fig._\r\n3_a_ the sternal plates, with portions of the first joints of the\r\nclaws, remain; one example (figured _Geol. S. E._ p. 169) possessed\r\nsix or seven arcuate abdominal segments, which were turned under the\r\nbody.[441]\r\n\r\n[441] I have described these small crustaceans somewhat minutely, and\r\nhave given them specific names, in the hope of directing the attention\r\nof collectors to these highly interesting relics, and leading to the\r\ndiscovery of more illustrative examples. See Foss. South D. pp. 96, 97.\r\n\r\nThe carapace or shell of the other crustacean observed in the Sussex\r\nGalt (_Notopocorystes Bechei_) is of an orbicular inflated form (see\r\n_Geol. S. E._ p. 169, _fig._ 3), and ornamented with twelve or thirteen\r\naculeated tubercles; its margin is dentated.\r\n\r\nIn the friable arenaceous limestone of the Cretaceous formation at\r\nSt. Peter’s Mountain, near Maestricht, the cheliferous claws of a\r\nsmall kind of crustacean (_Mesostylus Faujasii_, _Wond._ p. 338),\r\nare frequently discovered (and occasionally in the Chalk of Kent and\r\nSussex), but with no vestige of the carapace or shell. This curious\r\nfact is explained by the analogy existing between the fossil claws and\r\nthose of the _Pagurus_, or Hermit-crab, whose body is only covered by a\r\ndelicate membrane, the claws alone having a calcareous covering; hence\r\nthe latter might be preserved in a fossil state, while no traces of the\r\nsoft parts remained. In the fossil, as in the recent claws, the right\r\narm is the strongest. There is no doubt that the crustaceans to which\r\nthe fossil claws belonged possessed the same modification of structure\r\nas the recent (anomurous) Hermit-crab, and must have sought shelter\r\nin the shells of the mollusks with which their durable remains are\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL LOBSTERS.]\r\n\r\nFossil Lobsters.--The _macrurous_, or long-tailed, crustaceans, as the\r\n_Lobster_, are distinguished from those of the former divisions by the\r\nprolonged abdomen (or tail, as it is commonly termed), which forms\r\na powerful instrument of locomotion, and enables the animal to dart\r\nbackwards through the water with great rapidity; and this is furnished\r\nwith an appendage or tail, which none of the ambulatory crustaceans\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nOf the fresh-water species, the Cray-fish (_Astacus fluviatilis_),\r\nand of the marine, the Lobster (_Astacus marinus_), are illustrative\r\nexamples. The remains of three macrurous species occur in the London\r\nClay of the Isle of Sheppey, associated with congenerous crustaceans;\r\nand the segments of the tails (_post-abdomen_) are often well\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk contains a few species of the _Macrura_, which were first\r\ndiscovered in the quarries near Lewes, and are figured in _Foss. South\r\nD._ tab. xxx. xxxi.; they are among the most rare and delicate of the\r\nfossils of the Cretaceous strata. These remains consist of the carapace\r\nand claws, and rarely of the tail and antennæ, and are composed of\r\na friable earthy crust, which, when first discovered, is of a dark\r\nchocolate colour, but quickly changes to a pale fawn, or reddish brown,\r\nby exposure to the air. In the specimens obtained by breaking the\r\nstone, the crustaceous covering remains attached by its rough external\r\nsurface to one portion of chalk, and on the corresponding piece are\r\nsharp casts of the carapace and claws, having a glossy surface covered\r\nwith minute papillæ formed by the bases of tubercles or spines. Four\r\nspecies have been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnoploclytia Leachii. _Lign. 169, figs. 1, 2, 3._--This is a long\r\ndelicate crustacean, having a pair of equal, slender, anterior chelate\r\nclaws, the fingers of which are long, attenuated, and armed with a\r\nrow of obtuse cylindrical spines. The surface of the hand-claws is\r\nmuricated, or covered with short erect aculeated tubercles. The pincers\r\nin the specimen figured _Lign. 169, fig. 3_, are shorter than in\r\nmost examples. The carapace is elongated and sub-cylindrical, with a\r\ndorsal ridge and two lateral furrows, indicating the normal division\r\nof the cephalic and thoracic segments of the shield; the antennæ are\r\nlong, filiform, and setaceous (_bristly_), and are placed on squamous\r\npeduncles (see _Lign. 169, fig. 2_).\r\n\r\nThere appear to have been five legs on each side; the anterior or\r\nchelate pair are the most usual relics of this animal; of the other\r\nclaws and the branchiæ, but obscure indications have been obtained.\r\nThe abdominal segments are arcuate, and six or seven in number; their\r\nsurface is granulated; the appendage, or tail, is foliaceous and\r\nmarginate, with a few longitudinal ridges (see _Lign. 169, fig.\r\n1_).[442] The claws of these crustaceans may be easily recognised by\r\ntheir general aspect, and the length and straightness of the fingers or\r\npincers. In most examples traces remain of the tendinous expansion of\r\nthe muscles of the moveable claw (see _Lign. fig. 3_).\r\n\r\n[442] See Foss. South D. p. 221, _et seq._ for further details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 169.

The entire crust of this lobster is muricated, or beset\r\nwith spines and sharp tubercles.[444]\r\n\r\n[444] Foss. South D. tab. xxx. _fig._ 3. In the beautiful work of\r\nthe late Mr. Dixon, on the Fossils of Sussex, there are figures of\r\nvery fine specimens of these two species of Enoploclytia (plate\r\nxxxviii*.) with detailed descriptions by Prof. Bell (p. 344); but\r\nunfortunately, from inadvertence, no reference is made to my former\r\ndrawings and descriptions of these fossil Lobsters of the Chalk,\r\nand new names are given by the Professor; _E. Leachii_ appearing as\r\n\"Palæastacus macrodactylus,\" and _E. Sussexiensis_ as \"P. Dixoni.\" I\r\nneed scarcely remind my readers that according to the established rules\r\nof Nomenclature the _earlier specific names_ must be preserved; and\r\nthat, Prof. M‘Coy having already indicated the distinction of these\r\nfossils from the recent _Astacus_ by providing an appropriate generic\r\nappellation, these new names are altogether inadmissible.\r\n\r\nClaws of other _Astacidæ_ have been found in the Chalk of Sussex and\r\nKent; one species in particular is distinguished from those previously\r\ndescribed by its short curved pincers, and granulated surface;[445] and\r\nremains of other species of _Enoploclytia_, from near Cambridge and\r\nMaidstone, are described by Prof. M’Coy.\r\n\r\n[445] This species may be named _Astacus cretosus_, to indicate its\r\ngeological habitat.\r\n\r\nThe \"Lobster-clays\" in the Lower Greensand, or Neocomian, beds at\r\nAtherfield afford numerous fine specimens of a small long-clawed\r\ncrustacean, allied to _Astacus_; a fine specimen is figured in the\r\n_Geology of the Isle of Wight_, title-page vignette, and see page 232.\r\nOne or more species, apparently distinct from those of Atherfield, have\r\nbeen discovered by Mr. Beckles in beds of clay that appear to occupy\r\nthe line of junction between the Wealden and Greensand, on the Sussex\r\ncoast, between Pevensey and Bexhill.\r\n\r\nImperfect claws of _Astacidæ_ have also been found at other places in\r\nthe Shanklin Sand; and I have collected from the Galt at Ringmer, the\r\nabdominal segments of a small species, resembling _Meyeria ornata_,\r\n_Lign. 170_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 170. Fossil Crustacean. _Speeton Clay._\r\n_Yorkshire._\r\n\r\nMeyeria ornata: _nat._ (_Phillips and M’Coy._)]\r\n\r\nThe carapaces of two or three small _Astacidæ_, sometimes with the\r\nabdominal segments attached, as in the beautiful fossil figured in\r\n_Lign. 170_, are found in the Speeton Clay, near Scarborough. In\r\nthis example the post-abdomen and its appendages are entire, and\r\ntraces remain of the antennæ and some of the feet. These specimens\r\nare commonly imbedded in masses of indurated clay, as the fern-leaves\r\nin the Carboniferous ironstone, and are discovered by splitting the\r\nnodules through their longest diameter. The carapace of another small\r\nspecies (_Glyphea rostrata_)[446] occurs in the Oolite of Scarborough.\r\nMy friend, the Rev. J. B. Reade, has also discovered an example of this\r\nspecies in that rich repository of organic remains, the Kimmeridge\r\nClay, at Hartwell, Bucks.\r\n\r\n[446] This is the _Astacus rostratus_ of Prof. Phillips’s Geol. York.\r\nvol. i. tab. 4, _fig._ 20.\r\n\r\nA remarkable macrurous crustacean (_Eryon Cuvieri_) is found in the\r\nJurassic limestone of Solenhofen. Perfect specimens of this species\r\nare occasionally seen in collections; it is distinguished by its very\r\nlarge, flat, oval shell, with the front lateral margins strongly\r\ndentated, and by its short setaceous antennæ; the front claws are as\r\nlong as the body, and armed with pincers; the post-abdomen consists of\r\nsix segments, terminating in a caudal appendage or tail.\r\n\r\nIn the United States several fossil crustaceans have been noticed in\r\nthe Cretaceous strata of New Jersey; some of which are said to be\r\nrelated to _Pagurus_, and others to _Astacus_.\r\n\r\nFossil Prawns and Shrimps, of exquisite beauty, are found in the\r\nlithographic limestone of Pappenheim: a specimen from that locality\r\n(_Palæmon spinipes_) is figured _Wond._ p. 513: see also Frontispiece\r\nof this work.\r\n\r\nA large crustacean of the Shrimp family has been discovered by the Earl\r\nof Enniskillen in the Lias of Lyme Regis.[447] Other specimens also of\r\nMacrura, more or less perfect, have been obtained from the same rich\r\nmine of organic remains: especially some in which the _branchiæ_, or\r\nrespiratory organs, remain; and a portion of the post-abdomen, or tail,\r\nof a Cray-fish, as large as the common species.\r\n\r\n[447] This beautiful fossil is figured and described by Mr. Broderip,\r\nGeol.

This order includes many genera and species, some of which\r\nnearly approach the extinct family of crustaceans (Trilobites) whose\r\nremains abound in the palæozoic strata; and the parasitical Isopod,\r\n_Bopyrus_, that infests the common Prawn, is closely related to certain\r\ngenera of Trilobites, hereafter described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 171. Archæoniscus Brodiei. _Purbeck limestone._\r\n_Vale of Wardour._ (_Drawn by S. P. Woodward, Esq._)\r\n\r\nImpressions of the upper and under surfaces.]\r\n\r\nOne species of fossil _Isopod_ has been found in green fissile marl,\r\nat Montmartre; and another in fine-grained limestone, probably, from\r\nPappenheim.[448] No fossil remains of this order had been noticed\r\nin the British strata, until the discovery of the _Archæoniscus_ in\r\nthe Purbeck strata by the Rev. P. B. Brodie. The quarry in which\r\nthese relics were found is situated at Dallards, near the village of\r\nDinton, about twelve miles west of Salisbury. They are principally\r\ndistributed in a bed of light-brown and grey limestone, in the lower\r\npart of which are numerous fresh-water bivalves (_cyclades_), and a\r\nfew small oysters. These Isopods often occur in clusters (see _Lign.\r\n171_); the lenses of the compound eyes are sometimes detectable in the\r\nlimestone, and, rarely, attached to the head; traces of legs have been\r\nobserved, but no antennæ. In the same stratum the _elytron_ (sheath,\r\nor wing-case) of a coleopterous insect was discovered. Mr. Brodie has\r\nobtained specimens an inch and a half in length, and an inch broad.\r\nThese fossils appear to have been deposited tranquilly at the bottom of\r\nthe water which they inhabited, since they are usually found imbedded\r\nwith their legs downwards, and generally well preserved.[449]\r\n\r\n[448] Nat. Hist. Crust. Foss. p. 138.\r\n\r\n[449] See Brodie’s Fossil Insects, pp. 3 and 10.\r\n\r\nThe _Archæonisci_ also occur in the Purbeck insectiferous limestone of\r\nDurlstone Bay, near Swanage, and have been discovered in strata of a\r\nsimilar character at the Ridgway railway-cutting between Dorchester and\r\nWeymouth, by the Rev. Osmond Fisher, of Dorchester.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntomostraca.--The Crustaceans that we have above noticed belong to the\r\nSub-class Malacostraca; and we have now to describe some fossil genera\r\nbelonging to various divisions of the Entomostracous Crustaceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 172.

The carapace is crustaceous and of\r\na semilunar form, the head and thorax are blended together, and the\r\nsuperior abdominal shield, which is composed of confluent segments,\r\nappears like one piece, and has an indistinct trilobed character; the\r\nlast segment is prolonged into a three-edged, sharp, styliform weapon.\r\nThe Limulus has two reniform, compound eyes, composed of facets of a\r\npeculiar form. The gills are disposed on lamelliform processes. It is\r\ndistinguished from all other crustaceans by the mastication of its food\r\nbeing performed by the first joint of the thoracic legs which surround\r\nthe mouth, instead of by jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 173. Limulus trilobitoides.\r\n\r\n_Coal Measures._ _Coalbrook Dale._]\r\n\r\nVery fine examples of a fossil species of this remarkable genus are\r\noccasionally obtained from the lithographic stone of Solenhofen.[450]\r\nIn England three small species have been discovered in nodules of\r\nironstone and indurated clay, in the Carboniferous strata of Coalbrook\r\nDale, by Mr. Prestwich.[451] In one example (_L. Anthrax_[452]) two of\r\nthe legs are seen extending from under the body; in another species the\r\nsharp, pointed process of the tail is well developed (_Buckl._ p. 396,\r\nand tab. xlvi″.; see also _Lign. 173_). The specimen figured _Lign.\r\n172_ is one of several examples which I obtained by breaking up nodules\r\nfrom that celebrated locality. _Fig. 2_ represents the nodule unbroken,\r\nand without any indication of its contents; by a well-directed blow\r\nit was separated into two equal portions, _figs._ 1 and 3, in which\r\nthe carapace of the crustacean, and its marginal appendages, are well\r\ndisplayed. The rounded form of the carapace, and the membrane which\r\nappears to connect the spines, separate this species from all others.\r\n\r\n[450] Hist. Crust.

Soc. second series, vol. v. pl. xli. figs. 1-4.\r\n\r\nThe Eurypterus and Pterygotus are palæozoic crustaceans, of large size.\r\nThey are regarded by Prof. M‘Coy and Mr. Salter as belonging to the\r\nPœcilopoda, and as differing from the Limulus chiefly in having the\r\nsegments of the abdomen freely articulating with each other.[453] The\r\n_Eurypterus_ was first described by Mr. Dekay, in the United States,\r\nprobably from the Carboniferous system. The head is round, the thoracic\r\nand cephalic portions of the carapace being blended together, and the\r\nabdominal region is formed of eleven segments, with a caudal appendage.\r\nIt has two depressed, lunated eyes, remote from each other, and eight\r\nfeet, the anterior pairs furnished with _branchiæ_, and the hindmost\r\npair relatively larger than in any other crustacean. Two American\r\nspecies are described; the one is five, and the other about four inches\r\nlong.[454] In the Carboniferous strata at Burdie-house, near Edinburgh,\r\nand of Kirton, near Glasgow, a large species of this curious genius has\r\nbeen found by Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Scouler; the length of some specimens\r\nbeing estimated at from twelve to eighteen inches.[455]\r\n\r\n[453] See Salter on Pterygotus, Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol viii p.\r\n387.\r\n\r\n[454] Dr. Harlan, in Trans. Geol. Soc. Pennsylvania, vol. i. p. 96.\r\n\r\n[455] See the elegant Memoir on the Fresh-water Limestone of\r\nBurdie-house, near Edinburgh, by Samuel Hibbert, M.D. F.E.S.E.\r\n\r\nOther species of _Eurypterus_ have been noticed in the Upper Silurian\r\nrocks of Kendal, Westmoreland,[456] and of Kington, Radnorshire; and in\r\nthe Devonian of Russia.\r\n\r\n[456] Pal. Foss. Cambridge, Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nPterygotus.--In the Old Red sandstone of Forfarshire, and other parts\r\nof Scotland, the remains of this remarkable crustacean have been long\r\nknown to the quarry-men by the name of \"_petrified Seraphims_;\" from\r\nan imaginary resemblance of the expanded post-abdomen to the usual\r\nrepresentations of those ideal beings! This genus is characterised by\r\nthe angular carapace, which forms a lozenge-shaped shield; and the\r\nappendage of the post-abdomen, which, instead of being divided into\r\nsegments, as in most animals of this class, is a continuous flap. The\r\neye-pits on the carapace are like those of Eurypterus, but are very\r\nlarge. The claws resemble those of the common lobster. The external\r\ncrustaceous covering is ornamented with circular and elliptical\r\nmarkings, producing an imbricated or scaly appearance, the imprints\r\nof which gave rise to the enigmatical \"Seraphims\" of the Forfarshire\r\nsandstone. Some specimens indicate a total length of four feet![457]\r\n\r\n[457] The Old Red Sandstone, or New Walks in an Old Field, by Hugh\r\nMiller, p. 147. There are specimens in the British Museum from the\r\nquarries of Carmylie.\r\n\r\nBesides this Devonian species (_P. anglicus_), there is also a Silurian\r\nspecies (_P. problematicus_), from Herefordshire.[458]\r\n\r\n[458] See Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. viii. p. 386.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral fossil genera of the Entomostracous Crustaceans belong to the\r\n_Phyllopoda_ (_leaf-feet_), which constitute a subdivision of the\r\nBranchiopoda (_gill-feet_). Of these perhaps the most remarkable is\r\nthe Dithyrocaris, first discovered by Dr. Scouler in the Carboniferous\r\nshale near Paisley. This genus is allied to the recent _Apus_, and,\r\nlike it, has a broad, flat, thin carapace, easily divisible down the\r\nmiddle of the back, and a lengthened tail or post-abdomen, with a\r\ntrifid termination. Six species have been found in the Carboniferous\r\ndeposits of the British Isles.\r\n\r\nCeratiocaris and Hymenocaris, which are related to the recent\r\n_Nebalia_, are also of the Phyllopod group, and maybe said to resemble\r\na shrimp-like animal partly enclosed in a bivalve carapace, while its\r\ntail is exposed, and either protruded, or turned beneath the body.\r\nOf the first-mentioned genus there are three Upper Silurian species;\r\nand of _Hymenocaris_ Mr. Salter has described a single species (_H.\r\nvermicanda_) from the Lower Silurian (Cambrian) of North Wales.\r\n\r\nThe _Limnadiadæ_,--another Phyllopodous family, of which the recent\r\n_Limnadia_ is the type,--are well represented in the older rocks.\r\nThese Crustaceans are also bivalved, but the body is wholly enclosed.\r\nThey are of small size. Estheria, a genus closely related to Limnadia,\r\noccurs plentifully in the Wealden of Sussex and Germany, and in\r\nthe Lias of Westbury. Mr. Bean also has noticed a species (_E.\r\nconcentrica_) in the Oolite shell of Gristhorpe Bay; and the _E.\r\nminuta_[459] is characteristic of the Keuper division of the Trias in\r\nEngland and Europe.\r\n\r\n[459] This was formerly described as a _Posidonomya_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeperditia and Beyrichia are other fossil genera belonging to the\r\n_Limnadiadæ_. These little crustaceans were gregarious in their\r\nhabit, and, like Estheria, occur locally in great profusion. They are\r\ncharacteristic of the Silurian deposits; the former being an abundant\r\nUpper Silurian fossil in Europe and North America, and the latter,--a\r\nvery minute form,--both in the Upper and Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next group of Entomostraca that we have to notice belongs\r\nto the Lophyropoda (_feet crested with bristles_), namely, the\r\nOstracoda (_shelled_). The recent genera, _Cypris_, _Cythere_, and\r\n_Cypridina_,[460] are types of the three families of this group, and\r\nare the existing representatives of numerous closely related forms that\r\noccur in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n[460] The student should consult Dr. Baird’s elegant and elaborate work\r\non the Natural History of the British Entomostraca (published by the\r\nRay Society), for information on the characters and habits of these\r\ninteresting little crustaceans and their numerous allies\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 174.

They are often very minute, and numerous\r\nkinds swarm in our lakes and pools. The species of an allied genus,\r\nnamed _Cythere_, the shells of which cannot always with certainty be\r\ndistinguished in a fossil state from those of _Cypris_, inhabit salt\r\nor brackish waters. As the living _Cyprides_ are interesting objects\r\nfor microscopic examination, they are commonly shown in the exhibitions\r\nof the hydro-oxygen microscope, and their appearance is therefore well\r\nknown. Two recent species are figured in _Ly._ p. 183. These animals\r\nhave the body enclosed in a bivalve, horny case, the two pieces being\r\nunited by a hinge-line. They have four feet, and two pairs of antennæ,\r\nwith a pencil of cilia at the extremities; and one compound eye. They\r\nswim with rapidity, by means of their ciliated antennæ, and crawl about\r\nactively on the water-weeds and other subaqueous surfaces. Like the\r\nother crustaceans, they frequently moult or cast their cases, and the\r\nsurface of the mud spread over the bottoms of still lakes is often\r\ncovered with their exuviæ. The largest living Cypris (_C. clavata_)\r\ndoes not exceed one-eighth of an inch in length. The fossil cases or\r\nshells of Cyprides are found in considerable variety and in prodigious\r\nnumbers in certain Tertiary and Secondary strata, which appear to have\r\nbeen deposited by fresh-water; as, for example, in the lacustrine marls\r\nof Auvergne (_Ly._ p. 183), and the fluviatile clays and limestones of\r\nthe south-east of England. They have not been observed in any decidedly\r\nmarine beds; but Mr. Lonsdale discovered in the Chalk, by means of the\r\nmicroscope, cases of crustaceans, that belong to the genus _Cythere_\r\n(_Ly._ p. 26, figs. 21-24), the recent species of which inhabit the\r\nsea. One or more species of Cypris have been observed in the older\r\nBritish Tertiaries,--by Sir C. Lyell, in Hordwell Cliff (_Geol. Trans._\r\n2d ser. vol. iii. p. 288), and by Mr. Prestwich at Hempstead Cliff\r\n(_Brit. Assoc._ 1846); but in the Pleistocene deposits the Cypris and\r\nits congeners abound, and of these Mr. R. Jones has enumerated nine\r\nspecies (_Annals Nat. Hist._ 2d ser. vol. iii.). In many districts on\r\nthe Continent, the Eocene marls and clays abound in these remains.\r\nSome of the fresh-water Tertiary strata of France contain myriads of a\r\nCypris (named _C. faba_, from its bean-like form) which was formerly\r\nsupposed, but erroneously, to be identical with a species found in\r\nthe Wealden. The laminated marls of Auvergne contain, between every\r\nlayer, countless myriads of the shells of Cyprides, through a depth of\r\nseveral hundred feet; although each lamina of marl scarcely exceeds\r\nthe thickness of paper. Near Clermont, the green _cypridiferous_ marls\r\napproach to within a few yards of the granite which forms the borders\r\nof that ancient basin (_Ly._ p. 184). In the eastern portion of the\r\nbasaltic districts of India, Mr. Malcolmson has discovered two species\r\nof Cypris, associated with fresh-water univalves and bivalves.[461]\r\nIn England the principal deposits of the Cyprides, are the clays\r\nand limestones of the Wealden and the Isle of Purbeck,[462] to the\r\ncomposition of which the relics of these minute beings have largely\r\ncontributed. Entire layers of their cases are found in the laminated\r\nclays and marls on the southern shores of the Isle of Wight, at\r\nAtherfield and Sandown Bay, where some of the Wealden beds emerge from\r\nbeneath the lower division of the Shanklin sand. Upon splitting the\r\nclay in the direction of the laminæ, the exposed surfaces are found to\r\nbe covered with these minute bodies; as in the specimen, _Lign. 174,\r\nfig. 5_.\r\n\r\n[461] Geol. Trans. 2d ser. vol. v. pl. xlvii.\r\n\r\n[462] On account of the distinctive characters of their\r\ncarapace-valves, M. Bosquet has suggested the appellation _Cypridea_ as\r\na generic name for the Cyprididæ of the Wealden and Purbeck beds.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of four characteristic Wealden Cyprides, of their\r\nnatural size and magnified, is shown in _Lign. 174_. The one named _C.\r\nValdensis_, or Wealden Cypris, by Dr. Fitton and Mr. Sowerby (fig.\r\n1), is the most frequent, and occurs in numerous localities in Kent\r\nand Sussex. A Cypris having the case studded with relatively large\r\ntubercles (fig. 3), is found in many of the finer sandstones of\r\nTilgate forest; another, with the shell tuberculated, but divided by\r\na transverse ridge (fig. 2), indicating a rudimentary condition\r\nof the segments which characterise the class, is certainly distinct\r\nfrom the former, and can have no name more appropriate than that of\r\n_C. Fittoni_. The other beautiful species (_C. granulosa_, fig. 4)\r\nhas the surface of the case covered with granules. One more species\r\nhas been observed in the Weald clay, at Sandown Bay and Atherfield\r\n(by Mr. Lonsdale); it is distinguished by a short conical spine on\r\neach valve, and is therefore named _C. spinigera_. In the Weald clay\r\nat Resting-oak-hill, near Cooksbridge (_Geol. S. E._ p. 187), _C.\r\nValdensis_ is so abundant, that every thin flake is covered with its\r\nwhite calcareous shells; and upon breaking the nodules and septaria\r\nof reddish-brown ironstone which occur in that locality, myriads of\r\nbeautiful sharp casts of the cases are observable in almost every\r\nfragment. They are associated with fresh-water bivalves and univalves\r\n(_Cyclas_ and _Paludina_), and minute scales of fishes. The sandstone\r\nat Langton Green, near Tunbridge Wells, which contains casts and\r\nimpressions of several species of fresh-water shells, abounds in\r\n_Cyprides_; and the layers of argillaceous ironstone, interstratified\r\nwith the sandstone in one of the quarries, are particularly rich in\r\nthese remains. The surface of a recently broken slab is often covered\r\nby minute, polished, oblong, convex bodies, which are the casts of\r\ncypridean carapaces.\r\n\r\nThe Sussex marble is largely composed of the remains of these minute\r\ncrustaceans. Upon examining thin polished slices of this limestone\r\nunder the microscope, the cavities and interstices of the shells\r\nare found to be filled with the shields of Cyprides, entire or in\r\nfragments; and some specimens of the Purbeck marble equally abound in\r\nthese remains. The Purbeck marls, as well as the limestones, often\r\nabound with Cyprides. According to Prof. E. Forbes, these belong to\r\nseveral species, all more or less distinct from those of the Wealden\r\n(_Brit. Association_, 1850). The Cyprides of the Wealden of Germany\r\nhave been figured and described by Dr. Dunker; and several of the\r\nBritish forms are found there.\r\n\r\nAs the recent species inhabit still lakes, or gently running streams,\r\nand not the turbulent waters of estuaries, we cannot doubt that the\r\nstrata in which these animals so largely predominate were deposited in\r\nlakes or bays, communicating with the river which transported to their\r\npresent situation the bones and other remains of the colossal reptiles\r\nof the Wealden. And the beds of fresh-water snails, with scarcely any\r\nintermixture of other organic remains but the Cyprides, which are\r\nspread over extensive areas in the Wealden and Purbeck districts,\r\nappear to afford corroborative proof of this inference.\r\n\r\nFour species of minute bivalved Entomostraca from the Carboniferous\r\ndeposits have been referred to _Cypris_: viz. _C. arcuata_, Bean, from\r\nthe Coal-shale at Newcastle; _C. inflata_, Murchison, Coal-measures,\r\nnear Shrewsbury; _C. Scoto-Burdigalensis_, Hibbert, Coal-measures at\r\nBurdie-house, and Coal-shale at Derry; and _C. subrecta_, Portlock,\r\nalso from Derry, Tyrone.\r\n\r\nCythere.[463]--This animal differs but little from Cypris except in\r\nhaving an additional pair of feet. In the Subgenus Cythereis the\r\nvalves are thick, oblong, and strongly hinged; thus differing from the\r\nthin and more or less oval valves of the true Cythere and of Cypris.\r\nSeveral species of _Cythere_ and its sub-genera occur in the Tertiary,\r\nCretaceous, Oolitic, Liassic, Permian, and Carboniferous deposits.[464]\r\n\r\n[463] For description and illustration of this genus, see Baird’s\r\nBritish Entomostraca, p. 163, &c.\r\n\r\n[464] Consult M. Bosquet’s Memoir on the Tertiary Entomostraca of\r\nBelgium and France; Mr. T. R. Jones’s Monograph of the Cretaceous\r\nEntomostraca (Palæontographical Society), and of the Permian\r\nEntomostraca, in Prof. King’s Monograph of the Permian Fossils\r\n(Palæont. Soc.); and Prof. M’Coy’s Synopsis of the Characters of the\r\nMountain Limestone Fossils of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThree species of Entomostraca, very closely related to Cypridina,[465]\r\nfrom the Carboniferous rocks of Belgium, hare been figured and\r\ndescribed by M. De Koninck; one species from the Carboniferous rocks\r\nof Ireland, by Prof. M’Coy;[466] and two species from the Cretaceous\r\nlimestone of Maestricht,[467] by M. Bosquet. The genera _Cyprella_ and\r\n_Cypridella_ have been established by M. De Koninck for the reception\r\nof some allied forms found in the Carboniferous strata of Belgium; and\r\nEntomoconchus (M‘Coy) and _Daphnoidia_ (Hibbert) are allied British\r\nCarboniferous forms.\r\n\r\n[465] See Baird’s British Entomostraca, p. 176, &c.\r\n\r\n[466] Under the name of _Daphnia primæva_.\r\n\r\n[467] Under the generic appellation of _Cyprella_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrilobites.--Among the numerous petrifactions which are found in the\r\nlimestones in the neighbourhood of Dudley, in Staffordshire, there\r\nare certain fossil bodies which, from their extraordinary form and\r\nappearance, have for more than a hundred and fifty years been objects\r\nof great interest to the naturalist, and of wonder to the general\r\nobserver, and have long been provincially termed _Dudley insects_, or\r\n_locusts_.[468] By the earlier naturalists these fossils were referred\r\nto fishes, to molluscs, and to insects, before their real character was\r\ndiscovered. The most common type consists of a convex, oblong body,\r\ndivided transversely into three principal parts, and longitudinally\r\ninto three lobes, by two deep, parallel furrows; this last character\r\nsuggested the name _Trilobita_, or _Trilobites_, by which the family is\r\nnow distinguished by naturalists.\r\n\r\n[468] Lhywd.

Brongniart.[470] Many memoirs on the _Trilobites_\r\nhave since been published by eminent Continental and American\r\nwriters;[471] and much light has been thrown on the subject by the\r\nlabours of Martin,[472] Parkinson,[473] Stokes, Phillips,[474]\r\nKönig,[475] Dr. Buckland,[476] Sir E.

Like other crustaceans, the Trilobites were subject\r\nto the process of metamorphosis during their early stages of life;\r\nand M. Barrande has ascertained that one species, the _Saö hirsuta_,\r\nappeal’s in no less than twenty different stages of development. In\r\nits earliest, embryonic condition, it is a simple disk, and it passes\r\nthrough various stages until it becomes a perfect adult trilobite,\r\nhaving seventeen free thoracic segments and two caudal joints.\r\nNo less than ten genera and eighteen species were instituted by\r\npalæontologists on _some_ of the forms only which this one species\r\npresents in its different stages of metamorphosis, before M. Barrande’s\r\nlaborious and long-continued investigations gave him an insight into\r\nthe true relations of these various conditions of the same animal\r\nto one another. This talented and indefatigable palæontologist has\r\narrived at like results with other Trilobites, and has been enabled\r\nto add greatly to our knowledge of the natural history and geological\r\ndistribution of this interesting group of crustaceans. See Transact, of\r\nthe Sections, Brit. Assoc. 1849 and 1850; and _Trilob. Bohême_, pl. vii.\r\n\r\nThe _Trilobites_ have been arranged in numerous genera, the names of\r\nwhich in a few cases are expressive of natural characters, but in\r\nothers have reference to the obscurity that still invests some parts of\r\nthe organization of these animals.[482]\r\n\r\n[482] As, for example, Asaphus, _obscure_; Calymene, _concealed_;\r\nAgnostus, _unknown_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Blumenbachii. _Lign. 175, figs. 3, 4._--This is the\r\nTrilobite so well known as the Dudley locust, or insect. It consists\r\nof an ovate, convex, trilobed crustaceous shell, or case, and is found\r\neither expanded, as in _Lign. 175, fig. 3_, with its under surface\r\nattached to, and blended with, the limestone (_Wond._ p. 789); or\r\ncoiled up like an Oniscus, or wood-louse, as in _figs._ 4 and 4_a_.\r\nThe head is large, convex, rounded in front, with a broad border, and\r\ndivided into three lobes by two longitudinal depressions. The eyes are\r\ntwo in number, compound, and have numerous facets; they are situated\r\non the sides of the head, remote from each other. The carapace is\r\ndeeply trilobed by two longitudinal furrows; the thoracic portion is\r\ncomposed of thirteen segments; the caudal shield is small and nearly\r\nsemicircular. This species is from one to four inches in length. It\r\noccurs from the Lower Llandeilo rocks up to the Upper Ludlow inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe structure here described may be regarded as the normal type, but\r\nnumerous and important modifications prevail in the different genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 176 Homalonotus dephinocephalus.\r\n\r\n(_Reduced from_ pl. vii. _Sil. Syst._) _Upper Silurian._ _Dudley._]\r\n\r\nIn the genus Homalonotus, _Lign. 176_, the thoracic portion of the\r\ncarapace is but obscurely lobed, and consists of thirteen segments;\r\nthe abdominal is distinct from the thoracic, and formed of nine rings;\r\nit terminates in a prolonged point. The _H. Herschelii_ is a large\r\nTrilobite, very plentiful in the Upper Silurian schists of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another genus, Asaphus (_Geol. Surv. Decade 2_), the carapace is\r\nwide and much depressed; the middle lobe distinct, the cephalic portion\r\nrounded in front, and terminating posteriorly in a sharp process on\r\neach side. The eyes are compound, and each contains upward of six\r\nthousand lenses, many of which remain in some examples.[483] Some\r\nAmerican species belonging to this group are of a gigantic size, as,\r\nfor example, the _Isotelus gigas_ (of Mr. Dekay), which is eighteen\r\ninches long. In the Isotelus[484] the body is of an oval shape, and the\r\nposterior angles of the head are rounded; the thorax is composed of\r\neight segments.\r\n\r\n[483] Mem. Geol. Surv. Decade 2, pl. v. p. 2, note.\r\n\r\n[484] _Isotelus_, i. e. equal extremities.\r\n\r\nAnother division of the Trilobites has the body contracted, and very\r\nthick, and the abdomen large and scutiform, without any segmentary\r\ndivisions; the small crustacean (_Illænus perovalis_, _Murch._) _Lign.\r\n175, fig. 1_, will serve to illustrate these characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trilobite called Bumastus by Sir R. Murchison (from its grape-like\r\nform) presents a very curious modification of the normal type. Both the\r\nhead and caudal extremity are rounded, with no distinct longitudinal\r\nfurrows; and the whole surface of the carapace is covered by extremely\r\nthin, apparently imbricated, lamellæ, the edges of which are undulated,\r\nand the intermediate spaces studded with minute dots. The eyes are\r\nsmooth, and not granulose, as in Calymene. This genus is known in\r\nEngland by the name of the Barr Trilobite, from its occurrence in the\r\nlimestone near Barr, in Staffordshire; it is sometimes five inches\r\nlong, and three and a half wide (_Geol. Surv. Decade 2_, pl. iii. and\r\niv.).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus Ogygia (_Bd._ pl. xlvi. fig. 9) is characterised by the\r\nelliptical and depressed form of the carapace, its nearly balanced\r\nextremities, and the prolongation of the buckler, or cephalic portion,\r\non each side, into slender spikes, distinct from the body; the thoracic\r\nand abdominal regions are divided by two deep, longitudinal furrows,\r\ninto three lobes; there is also a straight, longitudinal groove, in\r\nthe front of the buckler (see figures and descriptions of _O. Buchii_,\r\n_Geol. Surv. Decade 2_). The Trilobites of this genus are found in the\r\nLower Silurian rocks of North Wales and Ireland; they occur also in\r\ngreat abundance in the slate rocks of Angers, and some species are more\r\nthan a foot in length.\r\n\r\nSome species of the genus Phacops have long, pointed caudal appendages,\r\nas the _P._ (formerly _Asaphus_) _caudatus_ (_Lign. 177_; _Bd._ pl.\r\nxlv. figs. 10, 10′; and _Geol. Surv. Decade 2_, pl. i.). The eyes are\r\noften well preserved, and each contains about 240 spherical lenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 177. Phacops caudatus. _Upper Silurian._ _Dudley._\r\n\r\nThe caudal extremity.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrinucleus. _Lign. 175, fig. 2_; _Ly._ fig. 432.--This genus\r\ncomprises several small forms which are found in the Lower Silurian\r\nrocks of England, and occur in the equivalent deposits of Sweden,\r\nNorway, and Russia.[485] In the _Trinucleus_, the cephalic shield is\r\nobtuse, trilobed, rounded, and terminating in lateral spikes; and\r\nits margin is marked by numerous pit-like depressions. There are\r\nsix body-rings or thoracic segments. The caudal shield is large and\r\nsomewhat triangular. There are no distinct eyes.\r\n\r\n[485] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 217.\r\n\r\n\r\nParadoxides. _Lign. 178._--The Trilobites of this genus are easily\r\nrecognised by the ends of the lateral segments of the thorax and\r\nabdomen terminating in deflected points, which extend in spikes beyond\r\nthe membrane they supported, and particularly those near the tail,\r\nwhich are much elongated; whereas in the other genera the lateral\r\npoints of the segments are united by a membrane, which often forms\r\na border beyond them. The cephalic buckler is semicircular, and its\r\nlateral angles are lengthened out behind into two strong spines; it\r\nis divided on the median line into four protuberances, by transverse\r\ngrooves. The thorax consists of from sixteen to twenty segments; the\r\nabdominal buckler is generally very small and rounded. The animals of\r\nthis genus have the body much depressed, and the lateral lobes wider\r\nthan the middle lobe: some species are of considerable size, attaining\r\nseveral inches in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 178. Paradoxides Bohemicus: _nat._\r\n\r\n_Silurian._ _Bohemia._]\r\n\r\nA very peculiar form of Trilobite (_Brontes flabellifer_, _Ly._ p. 348)\r\nis found in the Devonian strata of the Eifel and South Devonshire; the\r\nhead, or cephalic region, is narrow, and has two lunated eyes; the\r\nthoracic region is trilobed and short, and composed of about ten small\r\narticulations; the abdominal very small, and bordered by segments,\r\nwhich radiate and form a wide, fan-shaped expansion. Other species of\r\nthis genus occur in the Silurian rocks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the under surface of the Trilobites much remains to\r\nbe known. No decided indications either of antennæ or extremities\r\nhave been discovered. In an American specimen, Mr. Stokes detected\r\na plate,[486] which appears to be a _labrum_, or upper mandible or\r\nlip, resembling that of _Apus cancriformis_. This animal has a similar\r\nlabrum, \"and lateral influted terminations of the shelly segments\r\nof the body, with a distinctly trilobed _pygidium_ (tail or caudal\r\nportion), and a prolonged tail: the feet being foliaceous, and the\r\nabdomen merely covered by a membrane.\"[487] In the upper or dorsal\r\nsurface of the carapace the Trilobites approach certain _Isopoda_,\r\nparticularly in the characters of the buckler and eyes. Mr. Macleay\r\nstates that among the existing crustaceans there are certain genera\r\nwhich individually possess some one or more of the characters, which\r\nhave been thought peculiar to the extinct Trilobites. Thus the\r\n_Serolis_ (_Bd._ pl. xlv. fig. 6), and the _Bopyrus_, have a trilobed\r\nform; the female _Cymothoæ_ have the coriaceous margin of the body,\r\nand in some species are without eyes as are many of the Trilobites;\r\nwhile the eyes of the males of some _Cymothoæ_ are composed of large\r\nfacets, and are situated on the back of the head, wide apart, as in\r\nthe _Calymene_; rudimentary feet, and the absence of antennæ occur in\r\n_Bopyrus_; and lastly, the _Sphæroma_ has an onisciform body, and the\r\npower of rolling itself up into a ball, like the Calymene (_Lign. 175,\r\nfig. 4_). The analogy between the Bopyrus and the Barr Trilobite is\r\nso close, that if the latter had a body with thirteen equal segments,\r\nand short crustaceous feet, it would be in every essential particular\r\na male _Bopyrus_.[488] Burmeister regards the Trilobites as being\r\nrelated to the _Branchipus_. From the absence of eyes in the female,\r\nand their presence in the male of certain recent genera of crustaceans,\r\nit is not improbable that a similar character may have prevailed in the\r\nTrilobites, and that certain fossils referred to different genera, from\r\nthe presence or absence of eyes, may have been the males and females of\r\nthe same species.\r\n\r\n[486] Geol. Trans, vol. ii. p. 208. See also _Bd._ pl. xlv, _fig._ 12;\r\nand Burmeister, pl. vi.\r\n\r\n[487] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 665.\r\n\r\n[488] Ibid. p. 667.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Trilobites, as deducible from Mr. Macleay’s\r\nexposition of their structure and affinities, must have resembled those\r\nof the _Cymothoadæ_, some of which, like the Calymenes, coil themselves\r\nup, and are not parasitical; while their close affinity to Bopyrus, and\r\nthe apparent absence of distinct crustaceous feet, imply that they were\r\nto a certain degree sedentary. The flat under surface of their bodies,\r\nand the lateral coriaceous margin of several species, which is so\r\nanalogous to that of the multivalve shell _Chiton_, render it probable\r\nthat they adhered by a soft, articulated, under surface, to the rocks\r\nor sea-weeds. Their instruments of progression are unknown; whether\r\nthey moved by means of membranaceous feet, or by the undulations of\r\nsetigerous segments, like the earth-worm, or by wrinkling the under\r\nsurface of the abdomen, like the Chiton, are questions yet to be\r\ndetermined. It is evident, from their longitudinally trilobed form, and\r\nlateral coriaceous margin, that they had the power of firmly adhering\r\nto flat surfaces; and while thus sedentary the thin but hard dorsal\r\ncrustaceous shell would protect them from the attacks of their enemies.\r\n\"The Trilobites, probably, like the Chitones, adhered in masses one\r\nupon another, and thus formed those conglomerations of individuals\r\nwhich are so remarkable in certain rocks; but it is not likely that\r\nthey were parasitical, since almost all the existing parasites that\r\nadhere to other animals, have strong feet, armed at their extremities\r\nwith hooks for that purpose.\"[489] From the form of the _labrum_ of\r\nthe mouth (_Barrande_, pl. i. and ii A) it is inferred that they were\r\ncarnivorous, preying on naked mollusks, or on the annelides, with which\r\ntheir remains are associated.\r\n\r\n[489] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 669.\r\n\r\nAs the compound eyes of the _Trilobites_[490] are similar to those\r\nof existing crustaceans and insects (see _Wond._ p. 792), the highly\r\ninteresting and important fact is established, that the mutual\r\nrelations of light to the eye, and of the eye to light, were the\r\nsame in the remote epoch when the Trilobites flourished, as at the\r\npresent time; and that the condition of the waters of the sea, and\r\nthe atmosphere, and the relation of both these media to light, have\r\nundergone no change through the countless ages that have elapsed since\r\nthe deposition of the Silurian strata.[491]\r\n\r\n[490] The compound eyes in many specimens remain in a high state of\r\npreservation. M. Barrande in the eye of a _Brontes palifer_ counted\r\n30,000 lenses. See also Barrande, pl. iii.\r\n\r\n[491] See Dr. Buckland’s eloquent and instructive commentary on this\r\nsubject, _Bd._ pp. 401-404.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeological Distribution of Fossil Crustaceans. We have seen that the\r\nTertiary strata contain the remains of many of the highest organized\r\ncrustaceans; a few brachyurous, macrurous, and entomostracous genera\r\nappear in the Cretaceous, Oolitic, and Liassic formations; whilst\r\nthe Isopodous _Archæoniscus_ and several species of Cypris occur in\r\nthe Wealden and Purbeck deposits. Some few Entomostraca have been\r\nenumerated from the Trias and Permian.\r\n\r\nOne species of macrurous decapod has been found in the Muschelkalk of\r\nGermany; and Mr. Prestwich’s \"Apus dubius\" (_Geol. Trans._ 2d ser. vol.\r\nv. pl. xli. _fig._ 9), and Dr. Ick’s crustacean, noticed in _Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. i. p. 199, both from the Coal Measures of England,\r\nare probably true Decapodous Crustaceans. With these exceptions not\r\na species of the numerous tribes of Crabs, Lobsters, &c. has been\r\nobserved in the older formations, though composed of such enormous\r\nthicknesses of marine detritus, and containing countless myriads of the\r\nrelics of the inhabitants of the ocean.\r\n\r\nA few species of _Limulus_, several _Cytheres_ and allied genera, and a\r\nfew Trilobites (_Phillipsia_ and _Griffithides_) belong to the strata\r\nof the Carboniferous System. In the Devonian System we find some minute\r\nentomostracans, the gigantic _Pterygotus_, and various Trilobites\r\n(_Brontes_, _Cheirurus_, _Homalonotus_, _Phacops_, &c.); but it is the\r\nSilurian rocks that constitute the grand mausoleum of those ancient\r\nbeings, the Trilobites.\r\n\r\nThere are about thirty genera of Trilobites found in the Silurian rocks\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland. Many of these are common to the Upper\r\nand Lower Divisions of that system; and some of them are met with both\r\nin the Silurian and in the Devonian rocks, as _Phacops_, _Brontes_,\r\n_Cheirurus_, _Harpes_, and _Homalonotus_. The _Calymene Blumenbachii_\r\n(_Lign. 175_, _figs._ 3 and 4) ranges through the Ludlow and Wenlock,\r\nto the Bala and Llandeilo formations. The _Phacops caudatus_ also\r\n(_Lign. 177_), the _Cheirurus bimucronatus_,[492] and the _Encrinurus\r\npunctatus_[493] extend from the Ludlow, to the Llandeilo formation.\r\nThe Upper Silurian rocks exclusively contain some peculiar forms, as\r\n_Encrinurus variolaris_, _Bumastus Barriensis_, and several species\r\nof _Acidaspis_. And the Lower Silurian has several distinct genera,\r\nnamely, the _Trinucleus_ (_Lign. 175, fig. 2_), _Ogygia_, _Agnostus_,\r\n_Asaphus_, _Olenus_, _Remopleurides_, &c. One species of _Pterygotus_,\r\nand one of _Eurypterus_, the _Ceratiocaris_ and _Hymenocaris_, and\r\nseveral species of the minute bivalved Entomostraca (_Leperditia_ and\r\n_Beyrichia_) are all that remain to be enumerated as constituting, in\r\ncompany with the _Trilobites_, the Crustacean fauna of the ancient\r\nCambrian and Silurian seas.[494]\r\n\r\n[492] In Murchison’s Silurian System this form is figured (pl. xiv.\r\nfigs. 8 and 9) and described as Paradoxides bimucronatus.\r\n\r\n[493] This is described and figured as Asaphus tuberculatus in\r\nBuckland’s Bridgewater Treatise, pl. xlvi. _fig._ 6.\r\n\r\n[494] We have also to refer to the indications of the existence of\r\nother large Silurian Entomostraca afforded by the magnificent series of\r\nfossil foot-tracks lately brought to England by W. E. Logan, Esq., and\r\nobtained by that gentleman from the Potsdam Sandstone (Lower Silurian)\r\nof Eastern Canada. These foot-marks and trails have been determined by\r\nProf. Owen as being most probably referable to some large Crustaceans\r\nof the _Limulus_ Group, and are named by him _Protichnites_. (See\r\ndrawings and descriptions in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety, vol. viii.)\r\n\r\nOn Collecting Fossil Crustaceans.--The Crabs and Lobsters of the\r\nargillaceous tertiary strata are generally imbedded in nodules of\r\nindurated clay and septaria. On the shore beneath the cliffs on the\r\nnorth of the Isle of Sheppey, and near Southend, specimens may be\r\nobserved in the nodules that have been exposed to the action of the\r\nwaves, the attrition to which they have been subjected having partially\r\nworn away the surrounding stone, and displayed the enclosed fossils.\r\nIn these examples the carapace is occasionally seen on one side, and\r\nthe pair of pincer-claws on the other face of the boulder; the other\r\nfeet and the plates of the thorax may sometimes be developed in such\r\nexamples by chiselling away the enveloping mass. In the laminated marls\r\nof the tertiary and other deposits, in which the minute crustaceans,\r\nas the _Cyprides_ abound, thin slabs covered with these relics may\r\nbe easily extracted; and many of the tertiary clays and sands yield\r\n_Cytheres_, together with _Foraminifera_ and other minute fossils, on\r\ncareful washing and examination with a lens.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk crustaceans, particularly those which are muricated, or beset\r\nwith spines and tubercles, as the _Enoploclytia Sussexiensis_ and _E.\r\nLeachii_ (_Lign. 169_), require considerable patience and dexterity to\r\ndevelope successfully. The crustaceous covering of the carapace and\r\nclaws adheres firmly to the chalk by the rough external coat, while\r\nthe inner, smooth, glossy surface as readily separates. Hence, upon\r\nbreaking a block of chalk containing portions of these crustaceans,\r\nwe find one piece exhibiting a chalk cast of the claw or carapace,\r\ncovered with tubercles or papillæ, that have been moulded in the bases\r\nof the spines of the crust; and on the other portion the crustaceous\r\nshell imbedded by its outer surface, and presenting the internal glossy\r\nlining, beset with circular depressions, which are the bases of the\r\nspines. This crust is exceedingly friable, and will flake off by a\r\nvery slight touch. To obtain specimens with the external characters,\r\nit is necessary to proceed with great caution; and when indications of\r\na crustacean are observed in a block, the chalk should be chiselled\r\nor sawn off to within half an inch of the surface of the fossil, and\r\nthe remainder of the stone be cleared away, piece by piece, by means\r\nof a penknife or graver. By this process the fossils figured _Foss.\r\nSouth D._ pl. xxix. xxx. xxxi. were developed. When a fine specimen\r\nhas been broken, and the shell is attached to one piece of the stone\r\nand the cast to the other, it is possible to obtain an illustrative\r\nexample of the external surface, by cementing the pieces accurately\r\ntogether with very thin hot glue; and, when firmly consolidated, the\r\nchalk may be removed, and the spines, tubercles, and papillæ of the\r\ncrustaceous covering be developed by the method previously described. A\r\nthin coating of mastic varnish will give durability to the crust, and\r\nimprove its appearance; but the rich brown colour it possesses when\r\nfirst exposed soon disappears. The Crustaceans of the Galt are often\r\nfound amongst the argillaceous and pyritous nodules flung aside in\r\nheaps where the Galt is used for brick-making.\r\n\r\nThe _Cytheridæ_ of the Chalk, Galt, Oolite, &c. are to be obtained by\r\ndisintegrating the matrix in water, and examining the debris, after\r\nsifting, under a lens.\r\n\r\nThe Limuli of the Coal-measures often form the nuclei of clay nodules,\r\nas in the example figured _Lign. 172_, in which _fig. 2_ represents the\r\nnodule without any external indication of its contents, and _figs._ 1,\r\nand 3, the same broken, and displaying the crustacean. Traces of the\r\nlegs, branchiæ, and other appendages, should be diligently sought for\r\nin fossils of this kind, for they are more likely to be detected in\r\nsuch specimens than in those found in limestone. It is possible that\r\npolished sections of the coiled up examples of Trilobites (_Lign.\r\n175, fig. 4_) would throw some light upon the nature of the hitherto\r\nundiscovered organs of locomotion and respiration of this extinct order\r\nof Crustaceans.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW BRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL CRUSTACEANS.\r\n\r\n Abberley.

The skeleton in these animals,\r\nas in the Crustaceans, is chiefly external, and consists of a hard\r\nshell or case (composed of a peculiar substance, termed _chitine_),\r\ndivided into segments, and furnished with articulated or jointed\r\nhollow extremities. The head is distinct, and has a pair of compound\r\neyes, and of jointed antennæ. To the segments that form the thorax the\r\nlegs are attached, and these consist of three pieces in the hexapods\r\n(insects with six feet), each supporting a pair of feet. The wings\r\nin the flying insects are attached to the middle and third thoracic\r\nsegments. The legs, or articulated appendages, are hollow, as in the\r\nCrustaceans, and contain the muscles and other soft parts. The generic\r\nand other distinctions adopted by naturalists, to facilitate the study\r\nof this most numerous division of the animal kingdom, are founded on\r\nthe structure and configuration of the antennæ and wings. The latter\r\nconsist of flat membranous expansions, supported by hollow tubes or\r\nnervures; and in some orders consist of one pair, and in others of\r\ntwo. In burrowing insects, as the Beetle, the front pair of wings\r\nconstitutes a hard case (_elytron_), which covers and protects the\r\nmembranous posterior pair, when the animal is in repose or walking. The\r\nmodifications of the wings furnish the characters by which the class is\r\ndivided into orders. Thus the _Coleoptera_ (sheathed-wings) comprise\r\nthe beetles and other burrowing insects, in which the membranous\r\nwings are folded transversely beneath the elytra, or wing-cases. The\r\n_Orthoptera_ (straight-wings), those with two pairs of wings, of which\r\nthe anterior encase the others, the posterior being membranous, and\r\nfolded longitudinal during repose; as the Earwig, Cockroach, Mantis,\r\nand Locusts. _Neuroptera_ (nerved-wings), those with two pairs of\r\ntransparent reticulated wings, as the Libellula, or Dragon-fly, the\r\nEphemera, and the Termites. _Hymenoptera_ (membranous-wings), with\r\nsimply veined membranous wings, as the Gall-flies, the Bee, &c. The\r\nCicas, Aphis, and Coccus constitute the somewhat anomalous group\r\ntermed _Homoptera_ (equal-wings), in which the anterior pair of wings\r\nare usually similar to the posterior in consistence, and shut up in a\r\nroof-like manner. The _Heteroptera_ (different-wings) include the Nepa,\r\nNotonecta, &c. and have the anterior wings coriaceous at the base,\r\nmembranous towards the point, and shutting up nearly horizontally,\r\npartly lapping over one another. _Lepidoptera_ (scaly-wings) have\r\nwings covered with scales, as the Butterfly and Moth. In the _Diptera_\r\n(two-wings) the anterior pair of wings only are the instruments for\r\nflying, and the hinder pair are reduced to mere clavate appendages, as\r\nthe Gnat and Fly. The Phryganeæ (Caddis flies) constitute the order of\r\n_Trichoptera_ (hairy-wings), related to the Neuroptera, but resembling\r\nthe Lepidoptera in the distribution of the nervures of the wings, and\r\nin many other characters. Lastly, there remain the Wingless Insects,\r\ndivisible into three orders, of which the Flea, the Parasites, and the\r\nPodura are respectively the types. With these few remarks on those\r\ndurable parts of the structure of Insects which their fossil remains\r\ngenerally present, we must quit this part of the subject, and enter\r\nupon the examination of the relics which are the immediate objects of\r\nour present inquiry.\r\n\r\nFrom the enduring nature of the elytra, segments, and articulated\r\nextremities of insects, the fossil remains of animals of this class\r\nmight naturally be expected to abound in lacustrine and fluviatile\r\ndeposits; this, however, is not the case, and except in a few favoured\r\nlocalities, fossil insects are seldom met with, and good specimens\r\nrank among the most rare and interesting of the organic remains of\r\nthe Secondary formations. In certain Tertiary beds, as at Œningen,\r\nand Aix in Provence, insects of numerous species and genera have been\r\ndiscovered; and the cream-coloured limestone of Solenhofen, among its\r\nnumerous other treasures, has yielded some fine examples of this class.\r\nThe strata in which remains of insects have been found in England[495]\r\nare the Tertiary clays of the Bagshot series, the Hastings beds,\r\nPurbeck marls and limestones, Kimmeridge Clay, Oxford Clay, Forest\r\nMarble, Stonesfield Slate, Upper and Lower Lias, and the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n[495] Palæontologists are particularly indebted to the Rev. P. B.\r\nBrodie, F.G.S. for his compendious and valuable \"History of the Fossil\r\nInsects in the Secondary Rocks of England\" (8vo. 1845); and to J.\r\nO. Westwood, Esq. the eminent Entomologist, for the very important\r\nand interesting Observations on the Insect Remains, prefixed to the\r\nabove work. In an interesting paper on the Geology of the vicinity\r\nof Ilminster, C. Moore, Esq. has noticed the numerous Insect remains\r\nof the Upper Lias of that place. Prof. E. Forbes and W. R. Binfield,\r\nEsq. have discovered Insects in the Hastings series; and Mr.\r\nBinfield, besides having most successfully searched the Upper Lias of\r\nGloucestershire, has also detected some specimens in the Lias at Lyme.\r\nLastly, Mr. Morris has found Insects in the Upper Lias in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\nFossil Scorpion. (_Bd._ pl. xlvi′.)--The discover of a fossil Scorpion\r\nin coal-shale, associated with leaves, by Count Sternberg, and of\r\nSpiders in the limestone of Solenhofen, by Count Münster, proves the\r\nexistence at a very remote period of both these insectivorous families\r\nof _Arachnidans_, or spiders (_Bd._ p. 405). The fossil Scorpion was\r\nfound in a block of argillaceous shale, at Chomle, in Bohemia. It lies\r\nimbedded amidst the carbonized remains of leaves, and a large trifid\r\ncarpolithe or seed-vessel (see _Bd._ pl. xlvi′.): by a fortunate\r\nseparation of the shale, the back or dorsal carapace is shown on one\r\nsurface; and the thorax, with five or six legs attached, and the\r\nabdominal segments, are exposed on the other, together with a fragment\r\nof the tail of another and larger Scorpion. The head and eyes, one\r\nof the jaws with teeth, and a portion of the skin remain (_Bd._ pl.\r\nxlvi. figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). The horny covering seems to have undergone no\r\nchange; it is still elastic and transient, and consists of two layers,\r\nboth retaining their texture, and structure, and exhibiting under the\r\nmicroscope hexagonal cells divided by strong partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Spiders.--With the numerous insects preserved in the gypseous\r\nmarls at Aix, of which we shall treat hereafter, Spiders are\r\noccasionally found. A beautiful example, showing the under surface of\r\na small spider, with the papillæ of the spinning organs protruded by\r\npressure, from the cabinet of Mrs. Murchison, is figured, _Bd._ pl.\r\nxlvi′. fig 12 In the beautiful lithographic stone of Solenhofen the\r\nremains of spiders are not unfrequent.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTA.\r\n\r\nFossil Neuroptera.--Of this order, the insects of which are\r\ndistinguished by their four finely reticulated membranous wings,\r\nseveral fossil species have been found. Some of these are referable to\r\nthe family Libellulidæ;--insects so well known from their light and\r\nelegant figure, their beautiful and variegated colours, their large\r\nlustrous wings, and the velocity and gracefulness of their motions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 179. Fossil Libellula, or Dragon-fly. _Solenhofen._\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Mr. Joseph Dinkel._)\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet of the late Marquess of Northampton.]\r\n\r\nFossil Libellulidæ. _Lign. 179._--Of the highly organized family of\r\ncarnivorous insects, the _Libellulidæ_, five or six specimens have been\r\ndiscovered in the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen; a beautiful\r\nspecimen from that locality is represented, _Lign. 179_. In this\r\nexample both pairs of wings remain, but one wing is pressed down\r\nbeneath the abdomen: the nervures of the wings are admirably preserved.\r\n\r\nA few examples of the remains of this family have been found in the\r\nBritish strata. One species of _Libellula_ and one of _Æshna_ have\r\nbeen found by the Rev. Mr. Brodie in the Purbeck beds of the Vale\r\nof Wardour. Two species of _Libellula_,[496] two of _Æshna_, and\r\nsome other allied species have been obtained by Messrs. Strickland,\r\nBuckman, Binfield, and Brodie from the Lias. The wing of the _Æshna\r\nliassina_, discovered in the Lias, near Binton, in Warwickshire, by Mr.\r\nStrickland, is two inches and ten and a half lines in length, and eight\r\nand a half lines in its greatest breadth, being one-third larger than\r\nthe wing of the largest British species. See _Wond._ _Lign._ 119, and\r\np. 528.\r\n\r\n[496] A very interesting specimen of fossil _Libellula_, discovered by\r\nthe Rev. Mr Brodie in the Upper Lias near Cheltenham, is figured in the\r\nQuarterly Geol. Journal, for 1848, vol. v. pl. v.\r\n\r\nFossil Corydalis. _Lign. 181, fig. 2._--The wing of a remarkable\r\nfossil Neuropterous insect was discovered by me in a nodule of\r\nironstone, from Coalbrook Dale, and mistaken for a leaf. The specimen\r\nconsists of one wing, which, as M. Audoin first ascertained, closely\r\nresembles that of the living _Corydalis_ of Carolina; see _Lign. 181,\r\nfig. 2_. The membranous structure and the distribution of the nervures\r\nare distinctly preserved; on the portion figured the surface of the\r\nwing lies in relief on the stone; and on the corresponding part of\r\nthe nodule, a sharp imprint remains,[497] I have named this fossil in\r\nhonour of the eminent French savant, M. Alex. Brongniart.\r\n\r\n[497] This specimen is now in the collection of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nWings of _Corydalis_ have also been found in the Purbeck beds of the\r\nVale of Wardour, by the Rev. Mr. Brodie, who has also discovered\r\nremains of _Phryganeidæ_ and a _Termes_ in the same group of strata.\r\n\r\nPanorpa ? Liassica. _Lign. 180._--In the Lias, on the banks of the\r\nSevern, at Wainlode Cliff, Gloucestershire, specimens of minute\r\nneuropterous wings have been discovered. I subjoin accurate figures\r\nof two specimens in the cabinet of the Geological Society; they are\r\nrepresented twice the natural size; they resemble the wings of a recent\r\ngenus of Neuroptera, termed _Panorpa_; particularly _P. Germanica_. The\r\ntransverse lines are not fractures, but nervures, and are faithfully\r\ncopied from the originals.\r\n\r\nTo the above notice of British fossil neuropterous insects, I may add\r\nthat the wing of a large species (_Hemerobioides giganteus_) has been\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Buckland in the Stonesfield slate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 180.

M.) _Carboniferous_;\r\n           _Coalbrook Dale_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Coleoptera.--The _elytra_ or wing-cases of coleopterous insects\r\nhave long since been noticed in the oolitic slate at Stonesfield, near\r\nOxford; a locality celebrated for the only mammalian relies hitherto\r\ndiscovered in the Secondly strata of England. The Stonesfield elytra\r\nare always found detached; in no instance, I believe, has any other\r\npart of an insect been observed, except a single leg of a _Curculio_\r\n(_Bd._ pl. xlvi′. _fig._ 10). The specimen figured _Lign. 181, fig.\r\n1_, displays the usual characters of the largest species. These fossils\r\nare of a reddish-brown colour, with a finely granulated surface; there\r\nappear to be four or five species, all of which belong to _Buprestis_,\r\na family of beetles remarkable for their splendid metallic lustre.\r\nRemains of _Coleoptera_ occur in the Tertiary clays near Corfe,\r\nDorset,[498] and in the Lias of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire; and\r\nin the Danby oolitic coal-pits, in the eastern moorlands of Yorkshire,\r\nthe elytra of beetles have also been discovered, by Mr. R. C. Taylor\r\n(_Bd._ vol. ii. p. 78).\r\n\r\n[498] See Notice by the Rev. Mr. Brodie, Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. ix.\r\np. 51.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable fossil of this kind is described by Dr. Buckland;\r\na unique specimen of _Buprestis_, from Japan, about an inch long,\r\n_converted into chalcedony_, with the antennæ and portions of the legs\r\nfinely preserved. The surface of this insect is covered with clusters\r\nof minute concentric rings of chalcedony; an appearance common in\r\nsilicified shells. Associated with this fossil, were fragments of\r\nsilicified wood, bored with tubular cavities, apparently by the larvæ\r\nof insects of this family; and within these cavities was a quantity of\r\ndust produced by the boring, also converted into chalcedony (_Bd._ vol.\r\nii. p. 78).\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Curculio, a genus of coleoptera distinguished by their splendid\r\nelytra, of which the _Diamond Beetle_ is a familiar example, the\r\nremains of two species have been discovered in the nodular ironstone\r\nof Coalbrook Dale, by Mr. W. Anstice, and are figured and described by\r\nDr. Buckland (_Bd._ vol. ii. p. 76; and pl. xlvi′. figs. 1, 2). In one\r\nof these specimens (_Curculioides Ansticii_), with the exception of the\r\nrostrum and anterior part of the head, all the essential characters of\r\nthe insect are displayed; namely, the elytra, thorax, and six legs, the\r\nhindmost of which exhibits the enlarged femur, or thigh, a character\r\npeculiar to the _Curculionidæ_. The legs possess a tufted appearance,\r\nwhich that eminent entomologist, Mr. Curtis, conceives may have been\r\ncaused by fungi, after the death of the animal, as often happens in\r\ntropical climates. In the other example (_C. Prestvichii_), the insect\r\nlies on its back, with the left side raised upwards, and exhibiting a\r\nportion of the external surface of the left elytron; there are remains\r\nof the antennæ, and indications of the proboscis and of the legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 182.

Mr. Brodie.[499] This observer\r\nhas, indeed, been very successful in his researches in the latter\r\nlocality, for in the deposits of limestone and marl which yielded the\r\nisopodous crustaceans, previously described (p. 521, _Lign. 171_), he\r\nhas discovered the remains of several orders of insects, and states\r\nthat, for abundance and variety of specimens, the beds may be said to\r\nresemble the Tertiary marls of Aix and Œningen. These remains were\r\nobtained from a quarry at Dinton, about twelve miles west of Salisbury.\r\nThey consist chiefly of _Coleoptera_, with the remains of _Neuroptera_,\r\n_Trichoptera_, and _Homoptera_, and of several species of _Diptera_.\r\nIn the cream-coloured laminated Purbeck marls that axe exposed in\r\nDurlstone Bay (about one mile from Swanage) insectiferous beds have\r\nbeen found by the Rev. O. Fisher and Prof. E. Forbes, which are the\r\nequivalents of those of the Vale of Wardour; and similar beds were met\r\nwith in the cutting of the railway through the Ridgway Hill, between\r\nDorchester and Weymouth.\r\n\r\n[499] See Brodie’s Fossil Insects.\r\n\r\nIn a quarry on the road-side between the village of Stone and Hartwell,\r\nBucks, the Portland Oolite is covered by the Purbeck marls; in these\r\nlatter remains of Insects occur, together with scales and teeth of\r\nsmall Fishes, and abundance of _Cyprides_.\r\n\r\nAll the British localities of fossil insects have now been alluded to;\r\nbut on the Continent, independently of the celebrated limestones of\r\nSolenhofen, to which reference has been made, p. 550, there are several\r\ntertiary deposits exceedingly rich in these interesting fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL INSECTS.]\r\n\r\nFossil Insects of Aix, in Provence.--The town of Aix is situated in\r\nthe lowest part of a deep valley, the immediate flanks of which are\r\ncomposed of a thick fresh-water formation, lying unconformably upon\r\nstrata of Jura limestone. The fresh-water series consists of white and\r\ngrey calcareous marls, calcareo-siliceous grits, and beds of gypsum;\r\nand the quarries formed in the latter rock have long been celebrated\r\nfor the prodigious quantity of fish and plants which they contain.\r\nM. Marcel de Serres first made known the great abundance of insects\r\nin these gypseous marls, and has enumerated nearly seventy genera,\r\nchiefly of the Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera; they are mostly\r\nreferable to European forms, and to existing genera. An interesting\r\nMemoir on these strata, by Sir R. Murchison and Sir C. Lyell,[500]\r\nfirst directed the attention of the English reader to these beautiful\r\nfossils. In _Wond._ p. 261, an epitome of this valuable communication\r\nis given, and five specimens of insects are here figured, which will\r\nconvey some idea of their forms and perfect state of preservation.\r\n\r\n[500] Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for October, 1829.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 183.

Punctatus.\r\n\r\nFossil Insects of Œningen.--In the immediate vicinity of Œningen, near\r\nConstance, on the banks of the Rhine, there is the basin of an ancient\r\nlake, filled up with marls and limestones, presenting a fine example\r\nof a lacustrine formation, and abounding in fossil Fishes, Reptiles,\r\nPlants, Shells, Crustaceans, and Insects.[501] These Insects are often\r\nin an admirable state of preservation, and occur in the different\r\nstages of larva, pupa, and imago. The pupa of a _Libellula_ shows the\r\nmask, insertion of the legs, and the spiracula. Some belong to genera,\r\nthe species of which frequent marshy plants of the same kind as those\r\nwhich are found associated with the insects; and it seems probable that\r\nthey fell into the lake from the plants which grew on its borders,\r\nand became enveloped in the fine mud or sediment. Numerous species of\r\nseveral genera of Ants also occur in these deposits of Œningen and at\r\nRadoboj in Croatia.[502]\r\n\r\n[501] See the Memoir by Sir R. I. Murchison on the lacustrine formation\r\nat Œningen, near Constance, Geol. Trans, new series, vol. iii. p. 277.\r\n\r\n[502] See Prof. O. Heer’s Memoir, translated in the Quart. Journ. Geol.\r\nSoc. vol. vi. pt. ii. p. 61; and his History of Insects, ibid. p. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CADDIS-WORM.]\r\n\r\nFossil Larvæ of Phryganea. _Ly._ p. 185.--The _Caddis-worm_, so well\r\nknown to all the brethren of the angle, is the larva of the winged\r\ninsect termed _Phryganea_, and is abundant at the bottom of fresh-water\r\nstreams and lakes; the cases, like those of the marine _Sabella_\r\n(p. 385, _fig._ 6), are always studded over with extraneous bodies,\r\ncemented together by a glutinous secretion to the silken integument,\r\nor case, which encloses the lava. Some species are coated with pieces\r\nof stick or straw, others with minute shells, as planorbis, bithinia,\r\nand the like; and when the larvæ have passed into the perfect state,\r\ntheir cases, or _indusiæ_, remain. Many of the Tertiary fresh-water\r\nlimestones of Auvergne are almost wholly composed of the _indusiæ_\r\nof Caddis-worms, cemented together by calcareo-siliceous matter into\r\nstone, which is employed for building, and is called indusial limestone\r\n(_Wond._ p. 273). These limestones are associated with marls abounding\r\nin fresh-water shells and cyprides; the whole assemblage presenting\r\nall the stratigraphical and zoological characters of a lacustrine\r\nformation. \"If,\" says Mr. Scrope,[503] \"we consider that repeated\r\nstrata, of five or six feet in thickness, almost entirely composed of\r\nthese tubes, once extended over a district presenting a surface of many\r\nhundred square miles, we may have some idea of the countless myriads\r\nof minute beings which lived and died within the bosom of that ancient\r\nlake.\"\r\n\r\n[503] On the Geology of Central France, by G. Poulett Scrope, Esq. 4\r\nto. 1827.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Collecting Fossil Insects.--The localities in which the British\r\ncollector may reasonably expect to discover fossil remains of\r\nInsects, are Stonesfield, where the elytra of beetles are by no\r\nmeans scarce,--Coalbrook Dale, in which relics of this class are\r\nsometimes, but very rarely, found in the ironstone nodules,--Bedford,\r\nWarwickshire, and the Wainlode and Aust Cliffs, for Lower Lias\r\ninsects,--Dumbleton and Ilminster, for Upper Lias insects,--Dallards,\r\nnear Dinton, and Stone, near Aylesbury, and the exposures of similar\r\nbeds in Dorsetshire, for the Purbeck insects.\r\n\r\nThe white clays belonging to the Bagshot series of Bournemouth, Poole,\r\nand Corfe, so rich in beautifully preserved leaves and other parts of\r\nplants, should be carefully searched for insect remains, since these\r\nclays at Creech, near Corfe, have already afforded a few specimens.[504]\r\n\r\n[504] Quart.

Journ. vol. ix. p. 51.\r\n\r\nAt page 549 a few other English localities yielding these delicate\r\nand very interesting fossils are also indicated as having been lately\r\ndiscovered by some of our most acute and active geologists.\r\n\r\nShould the student visit the celebrated sites of these fossils in\r\nFrance and Germany, namely, Aix, Œningen, Solenhofen, &c., he will have\r\nbut little difficulty in obtaining an interesting series, at a moderate\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe marls and limestones in which insects occur are often of a\r\nlaminated character, and in general readily split asunder in the\r\ndirection favourable for the display of the insects. In some examples,\r\nonly the form of the animal is seen through a thin opaque pellicle of\r\ncalcareous earth, which may be removed by a penknife or graver, and the\r\nwings, elytra, antennæ, legs, &c. will thus be disclosed. A very thin\r\ncoating of mastic varnish heightens the colours of such specimens, and\r\nrenders them more durable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL ICHTHYOLOGY; COMPRISING THE SHARKS, RAYS AND OTHER PLACOID\r\nFISHES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 184. A group of Fossil Fishes. _Tertiary._ _Aix._\r\n\r\nLebias cephalotes (_Agassiz_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nAscending from the two grand subdivisions of the animal kingdom,\r\nthe _Mollusca_ and the _Articulata_, we advance to the Vertebrata,\r\nanimals distinguished from all those which have previously engaged\r\nour attention, by the possession of a bony, jointed, hollow column of\r\nsupport, or spine, formed of bones termed _vertebræ_ (_turn or whirl\r\nbones_), and enclosing and protecting those strands or cords of the\r\nnervous system called the spinal marrow; the former classes, being\r\ndestitute of such a structure, have the general name of _Invertebrata_.\r\n\r\nIn the beings whose mineralized remains form the subject of our present\r\ninvestigation, the durable parts of the frame-work, or skeleton, are,\r\nin most instances, situated internally, and their fossil relics consist\r\nprincipally of the bones, or solid earthy portions of their structures,\r\neither imbedded in the rocks in their natural relative position, or in\r\na state of dismemberment and dispersion. In most cases the teeth, and\r\nin many the durable parts of their external integument, or skin, are\r\nalso preserved, in a greater or less degree of integrity.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest class of _vertebrata_, the Fishes, the skin is covered\r\nwith numerous pieces or scales, of a dense, durable substance, and\r\nstrengthened, in some families, by the addition of osseous plates; thus\r\nconstituting a flexible and almost impenetrable coat of armour, which\r\naffords suitable protection to beings peculiarly exposed to external\r\ninjuries, from the nature of the regions they inhabit, and the state\r\nof warfare with each other in which they are constantly engaged.\r\nConfined to a fluid medium, they are provided with organs fitted for\r\naquatic respiration, called _branchiæ_, or gills, and with instruments\r\nof progressive motion, termed _fins_, by which they are enabled to\r\npropel themselves through the water with great velocity. The apparatus\r\nfor seizing, tearing, and crushing their prey presents numerous and\r\nimportant modifications, corresponding to the habits and economy of the\r\ndifferent genera; their teeth offering as great variety of form and\r\nstructure as those of the higher orders of animals.\r\n\r\nThe cartilaginous or the osseous nature of the skeleton, and the\r\nnumber and position of the fins, were the characters formerly employed\r\nin the classification of Fishes; but Prof. Agassiz, conceiving the\r\nstructure of the skin to afford a natural index to the essential\r\nmodifications of organization and functions, has, with great sagacity,\r\nadopted an arrangement founded upon the form and structure of the\r\nscales; and he has divided the whole class into four orders, each\r\ndistinguished by essential differences in the dermal (skin) system.\r\nTo the geologist this method has proved of inestimable value; for it\r\nis simple, easy of application, and, so far as our present knowledge\r\nextends, may be relied upon as affording accurate conclusions as to\r\nthe nature and relations of the originals to which a few detached\r\nfossil scales may have belonged. Another important aid has been derived\r\nfrom the microscopical examination of the structure of the teeth; and\r\na splendid work on this subject by Professor Owen has opened a wide\r\nfield of palæontological investigation, which is yet but very partially\r\nexplored.[505]\r\n\r\n[505] Odontography; or, a Treatise on the Comparative Anatomy of\r\nthe Teeth; their Physiological Relations, Mode of Development, and\r\nMicroscopic Structure; illustrated by upwards of 150 plates. By Prof.\r\nR. Owen, F.R.S. &c. 4to. London. 1840-1845.\r\n\r\nThe living species of Fishes exceed eight thousand; and those found\r\nin a fossil state, and determined by M. Agassiz, already amount to\r\nupwards of one thousand five hundred; while several hundreds are\r\nstill undescribed; and the rapid progress of geological research is\r\ncontinually adding to the number: upwards of six hundred British fossil\r\nspecies are enumerated. In an initiatory work like the present, it will\r\nbe necessary to confine our remarks to an illustration of the mode in\r\nwhich the investigation of the fossil remains of the animals of this\r\nclass should be conducted; and, by the elucidation of a few leading\r\nprinciples, prepare the student for the perusal of works expressly\r\ndevoted to this branch of Palæontology.[506]\r\n\r\n[506] The admirable and important work entitled \"_Recherches sur\r\nles Poissons Fossiles, par Louis Agassiz_,\" stands preeminent in\r\nthis department of science. It consists of five volumes, 4to. of\r\nletter-press, and five volumes, folio, of coloured plates. It must be\r\nconsulted by all who would acquire a correct view of the present state\r\nof fossil Ichthyology. _It is from this work that the commentary in the\r\ntext has been chiefly derived._\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of fishes rank in the first class of the \"Medals\r\nof Creation,\" for they demonstrate the existence of numerous tribes\r\nof highly organized beings in some of the most ancient fossiliferous\r\nstrata, and the continuance of the same type of organization, variously\r\nmodified, through the entire series of subsequent deposits to the\r\npresent time. Each geological formation contains peculiar groups of\r\nfossil fishes, distinguished by distinct modifications of structure.\r\nThus, according to the data at present obtained, all the osseous fishes\r\nanterior to the Chalk belong to genera which have no representatives\r\namong existing species; and they are characterised by rhomboidal scales\r\ncovered with enamel.\r\n\r\nThe state of conservation in which the fossils of this class occur,\r\nappears to have depended on the relative delicacy or firmness of the\r\noriginal structures, and on the nature of the deposits in which the\r\nfishes were imbedded. Thus the fossil fishes of the early formations,\r\nwhich are characterised by their dense integument and enamelled\r\nscales, often present the entire forms of the originals, and generally\r\nconsiderable portions of the connected scales, with the fins and other\r\nappendages: while the specimens of later deposits, which contain\r\na large proportion of species with delicate scales, more often\r\ndisplay the mineralized osseous skeleton, than the dermal structure.\r\nSedimentary strata composed of mud or fine detritus, of whatever age,\r\nhave been most favourable to the preservation of the entire forms;\r\nhence we often find in the pulverulent clays and marls of the Tertiary\r\nstrata, in the Chalk of England and Westphalia, and in the fine\r\nlithographic stone of Solenhofen, fishes perfect in form, and not only\r\nindividuals, but groups, with the scales, fins, head, teeth, and even\r\nthe capsule of the eye, in their natural positions. A small slab of\r\nmarl from Aix, in Provence, in the collection of Sir R. I. Murchison,\r\ncontains scores of small fishes, as perfect as if recently imbedded\r\nin soft mud: a portion of this specimen is represented, _Lign. 184_;\r\nand the beautiful fish figured in the frontispiece of vol. i. (pl. i.\r\n_fig._ 3), from near Castellamare, will serve to illustrate the state\r\nof perfection of some of the ichthyolites of the Jura limestone. In\r\nthe Chalk, many of the fishes are uncompressed, the body being as\r\nperfect in form as if the original had been surrounded by soft plaster\r\nof Paris while floating in the water. But in coarse limestones and\r\nconglomerates,--in other words, in materials that have been subjected\r\nto the action of the waves and torrents,--detached teeth, scales,\r\nbones, &c. constitute the principal vestiges of this class of beings.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this department of Paleontology, it will be\r\nexpedient to consider,--1stly, the characters afforded by the scales\r\nand dermal appendages; 2dly, the teeth, or dental organs; 3dly, the\r\nosseous and cartilaginous skeletons; and lastly, apply the data thus\r\nobtained to the elucidation of some of the principal fossil genera and\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nScales of Fishes.--The dermal plates or scales are composed of two\r\nsubstances, disposed in laminæ or plates; the one cartilaginous or\r\nhorny,--the other dense and osseous, possessing the structure of bone.\r\nIn most species the scales are imbricated, _i. e._ lie over each other\r\nlike the tiles of a roof; the margin of a front row partly covering the\r\nseries immediately behind. From this arrangement, the apparent shape\r\nof the scales is very different from their true form; the processes of\r\nattachment and the lateral angles being concealed. The scales that are\r\nnot imbricated are either very small, and imbedded in the substance of\r\nthe skin so as to be imperceptible to the naked eye, as in the shagreen\r\nof Sharks; or are disposed in the form of bosses or scutcheons, as in\r\nthe Rays; sometimes bristling equally over the surface of the body,\r\nas in the _Diodon_; and sometimes covering it like mosaic work; or\r\nforming particular series on certain regions of the body, while the\r\nother parts are garnished with different scales, as in the Sturgeon.\r\nThere are a few genera destitute of scales. In almost all fishes there\r\nis a particular series disposed in a gently undulated line along each\r\nside of the body, from the head to the tail, and constituting what\r\nis termed the lateral line; these scales are tubular, and serve an\r\nimportant purpose in the economy of these animals. Every one must be\r\naware that the body in most living fishes is constantly covered with\r\na kind of mucus, or slime, which serves to lubricate the skin and to\r\ndefend it from the action of the surrounding medium. This fluid is\r\nsecreted by a mucous canal or duct, which extends along the body, and\r\nramifies in all the bones of the head, jaws, &c.; and it is distributed\r\nover the surface of the head by numerous pores in the bones, and over\r\nthe body by the tubes formed by the row of scales above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 185. Fossil Scales of Fishes. (_highly magn._)\r\n_Chalk._ _Lewes._]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Scale or plate of the _shagreen_ of a Shark.\r\n       2.--Scale of Macropoma Mantelli; the exposed surface.\r\n       3.--Scale of Beryx Lewesiensis; the exposed surface.\r\n       4.--Scale of Osmeroides Mantelli; the entire form.\r\n\r\nThe four orders into which this grand class of vertebrata is divided by\r\nM. Agassiz, are founded upon the peculiar structure of the scales;[507]\r\nand are characterised as follow:--\r\n\r\n[507] For illustrations of the scales of fishes, see _Wond._ p. 339,\r\n_Lign. 68_, and p. 340, _Lign. 69_; _Foss. Brit. Mus._ p. 419; and\r\n_Ly._ fig. 306, figs. 342-347, &c. And for their minute structure, see\r\nProf. Williamson’s important paper in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1851.\r\n\r\n _Order I._ Placoid (_a broad plate_).--The skin covered irregularly\r\n with enamelled plates, sometimes of a large size, but frequently in\r\n small points, as the shagreen on the dermal integument of the _Sharks_\r\n and the tubercles of the _Rays_. _Lign. 185, fig. 1_, a fossil\r\n _placoidian_ scale from the skin of a shark, highly magnified.\r\n\r\n _Order II._ Ganoid (_splendid_, from the brilliant surface of the\r\n enamel).--The scales are of an angular form, and composed of plates of\r\n horn or bone, covered with a thick layer of enamel; their structure\r\n is identical with that of the teeth. The _Sturgeon_ is an example of\r\n this order. _Lign. 196, figs. 1, 2, 3, 4_, are fossil scales of a\r\n _ganoidian_ fish.\r\n\r\n _Order III._ Ctenoid (_toothed, or comb-like_).--The scales are formed\r\n of plates, which are toothed or pectinated on their posterior margin\r\n or edge, like a comb. As the plates are superimposed on each other, so\r\n that the lowermost always extend beyond the uppermost, their numerous\r\n sharp points or teeth render the scales very harsh to the touch. The\r\n _Perch_ belongs to this order. _Lign. 185, fig. 3_, represents a\r\n fossil _ctenoidian_ scale.\r\n\r\n _Order IV._ Cycloid (_circular_).--The scales are composed of simple\r\n laminæ, or plates of bone or horn, without enamel, and have smooth\r\n borders; but their external surface is often ornamented with markings.\r\n The scales of the lateral line consist of funnels placed one within\r\n the other; the contracted part of which, applied against the disk of\r\n the scale, forms the tube through which the mucus flows. To this order\r\n belong the Mullet, Salmon, and Carp. _Lign. 185, fig. 4_, is the\r\n scale of a fossil _cycloidian_ fish.\r\n\r\nFins of Fishes.--As the progression of fishes through the water is\r\nprincipally effected by the action of the tail, they have no limbs\r\ncommonly so called. The instruments for balancing the body, and for\r\nassisting progression, are the fins, which are composed of numerous\r\nrays that support a membranous expansion; and the number and situation\r\nof the fins present various modifications in the different orders and\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nThe fins are named according to the situation they occupy; for example,\r\n_pectoral_, those on each side of the chest, and which correspond\r\nto the anterior extremities of other vertebrated animals; _dorsal_,\r\non the back; _ventral_, on the belly; _caudal_, on the tail. (See\r\noutlines of Fish, _Ligns. 186, 187, 195_.) The rays are of two kinds;\r\n1st, the _Spinous_ rays; these consist of a single osseous piece,\r\nusually dense and pointed, sometimes flexible and elastic, and divided\r\nlongitudinally (_Ligns. 188, 196_); 2d, _Soft_ or _articulated_ rays,\r\nwhich are composed of numerous small articulations or joints, and\r\ndivide into branches at their extremities. Many species of fishes have\r\nfour fins; others six; some but two; and in certain genera they are\r\naltogether wanting. In a fossil state the fins are often beautifully\r\npreserved; even the soft rays in many of the Tertiary marls and in the\r\nChalk, are found entire, and attached to the body in their natural\r\nsituation. The large, strong, spinous rays of the dorsal fins of the\r\ncartilaginous fishes, as the _Sharks_ and _Rays_, are generally found\r\ndetached, or connected only with a few vertebræ; but they are so\r\nabundant in some of the Secondary deposits (and in numerous instances\r\nthey are the only vestiges of extinct species and genera), that they\r\npossess great geological interest; they are distinguished by the term\r\n_Ichthyodorulites_ (_fossil fish-weapons_), under which head they will\r\nhereafter be described (see _Lign. 188_). The first ray in the dorsal\r\nfin of some fishes is protected in front by a double row of enamelled\r\nscales, and these often occur in a fossil state (see _Lign. 196,\r\nfig. 5_).\r\n\r\nTeeth of Fishes.--Of all the durable parts of animals teeth occur\r\nin the mineral kingdom, the teeth of fishes present by far the most\r\nnumerous, varied, and striking modifications of form, structure,\r\ncomposition, mode of arrangement, and attachment; and yet these dental\r\norgans, separately considered, do not in many instances, either in\r\ntheir structure or mode of implantation, afford characters by which the\r\nnatural affinities of the original can be satisfactorily ascertained;\r\nand without the aid of other parts of the skeleton it is often\r\nimpossible to determine, from external characters only, whether an\r\nunknown form of tooth belonged to an animal of the class of Fishes or\r\nof Reptiles. Although the modifications of form are almost innumerable,\r\nthey are referable to four principal types; namely, the conical, the\r\nflattened, the prismatic, and the cylindrical.[508]\r\n\r\n[508] The \"Odontography\" of Professor Owen should be consulted by\r\nthose who would thoroughly comprehend this interesting department of\r\nscience. See also the _Article_ Teeth, by Prof. Owen in the Cyclopædia\r\nof Anatomy and Physiology.\r\n\r\nThe conical teeth are extremely variable in size and form; some are\r\nslender, almost invisible points, distributed like the pile of velvet\r\n(_villous-teeth_), or set like the hairs of a brush (_brush-teeth_);\r\nsome are long and slender, or barbed at the point; others are obtuse;\r\nand many are long and striated at the base, and closely resemble the\r\nteeth of certain reptiles. The depressed teeth are equally diversified;\r\nsome have the grinding surface smooth; others, deeply grooved; in some\r\nit is flat; in others convex. In form they are either lozenge-shaped,\r\nelliptical, square, oblong, semilunar, &c. The cylindrical teeth are\r\nhemispherical, or flattened; in some fishes they are short and thick;\r\nin others slender and support an obtuse, conical crown. The prismatic\r\nform is equally modified; from the compressed, sharp, lanceolate,\r\ncutting teeth, to the strong, triangular, three-pointed dentary\r\norgans.[509]\r\n\r\n[509] For illustrations of the teeth of fishes, see plate iv. figs. 1,\r\n2, 8, 10, and _Ligns._ 189, 191-194, 197, 198, 202, 205; _Foss. Brit.\r\nMus._ p. 449; and _Ly._ figs. 236, 308, 324, and 383.\r\n\r\nThe mode of arrangement and attachment of the teeth, is as diversified\r\nas their forms. In some species all the teeth are of one type, and\r\ndisposed in somewhat of a serial order on both sides of the jaws; but\r\nin a large proportion of fishes there are several kinds of teeth, which\r\nare implanted not only in the jaws, properly so called, but on the\r\nbones which form the cavity of the mouth, the arches of the palate,\r\ntongue, &c.; and it is peculiar to this class of vertebrata to present\r\nexamples of teeth developed in the median line (_along the middle_) of\r\nthe mouth, as in certain species of Rays; or crossing the symphysis\r\n(the _front line of union_ of the two sides) of the lower jaw, as in\r\n_Myliobates_[510] (see _Lign. 194, fig. 2_). In some species the\r\nteeth are implanted in sockets, to which they are attached only by the\r\nsoft parts, as in the rostral teeth of the _Saw-fish_; some have hollow\r\nbases, supported upon bony prominences, which rise from the base of\r\nthe socket; as in several fossil teeth from the Chalk. \"But by far the\r\nmost common mode of attachment is by a continuous ossification between\r\nthe dental pulp and the jaw,\"[511] the teeth being thus anchylosed to\r\nthe bone. In the Sharks the osseous bases of the teeth are attached by\r\na ligamentous substance to the tough, dense crust, which covers the\r\ncartilaginous jaws; the teeth of these fishes are therefore generally\r\nfound detached in a fossil state, in consequence of the decomposition\r\nof this substance.\r\n\r\n[510] Odontography, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[511] Op. cit. p. 6.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are composed of a dense, osseous material, of a finely\r\ntubular structure, termed _dentine_; which, in many species, forms on\r\nthe external surface of the tooth a layer of firmer texture, with a\r\nglossy surface, resembling enamel. The essential character of their\r\norganization is to have a pulp or medullary cavity, or cavities, filled\r\nwith a plexus of blood-vessels and nerves, from which the minute\r\ntubes composing the dentine radiate.[512] The differences observable\r\nin the size, mode of ramification, and distribution of the medullary\r\ncavities or canals, and the _calcigerous tubes_,[513] as revealed by\r\nmicroscopic exploration, constitute important distinctive characters;\r\nparticularly in the examination of the fossil teeth of extinct fishes.\r\nIn some teeth the dentine is traversed by equidistant, parallel,\r\nmedullary canals; in others, these channels frequently subdivide, and\r\ntheir branches anastomose with each other. In some the medullary canals\r\nform a reticulated, or net-like structure in the dentine, the meshes\r\nof which are occupied by calcigerous tubes, and cells; often producing\r\na dendritical appearance, as in the tooth of a fossil fish named\r\n_Dendrodus_. \"In the highest type of structure, the dentine consists of\r\na simple medullary cavity or canal, and a single system of calcigerous\r\ntubes, which radiate from the central or sub-central pulp-cavity, at\r\nright angles to the periphery of the tooth\" (_Owen_), as in the teeth of\r\nthe extinct Sauroid (_lizard-like_) fishes. A continued succession of\r\nteeth takes place during the life of the fish, and we often find in\r\nfossil specimens a series of successional teeth beneath the row in use;\r\nas in the fragment of a jaw of _Lepidotus_, from Tilgate Forest _Lign.\r\n107_.\r\n\r\n[512] See Owen’s Odontography; and Tome’s Dental Physiology.\r\n\r\n[513] _Calagerous tubes_; so named because they are composed of _calx_,\r\nor lime.\r\n\r\nSkeletons of Fishes.--The skeletons of the animals of this class differ\r\nso remarkably in their relative degree of firmness and elasticity, in\r\nconsequence of peculiar modifications of their constituent substance,\r\nas to form two grand divisions; one of which is termed the _osseous_, the\r\nother the _cartilaginous_. The essential difference in the skeletons of\r\nthese two groups consists in the presence or absence of earthy matter\r\n(_phosphate and carbonate of lime_) in the materials of which they are\r\nconstructed. In the cartilaginous fishes, the skeleton is cartilaginous\r\nand transparent; but in some species, the skin has dense osseous\r\nparticles or plates on the skin, as in the _Rays_; and in others, the\r\nhead and body are protected by large osseous scutcheons, as in the\r\n_Sturgeon_. There is also an intermediate group of fishes, termed the\r\n_fibro-cartilaginous_, in which the skeleton contains lime, but in a\r\nmuch less proportion than in the true osseous fishes. In some genera,\r\ncertain portions of the skeleton, as the bodies of the vertebra, are\r\ncartilaginous, while the spinous processes, ribs, &c. are osseous;\r\nthese characters are of considerable importance in the investigation of\r\nthe fossil remains of fishes, as we shall hereafter have occasion to\r\ndemonstrate.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton consists of the _cranium_ or skull, which is composed\r\nof numerous bones,--the jaws, and bones of the tongue,--the osseous\r\nframe-work of the organs of respiration, consisting of the bones, rays,\r\nand arches that support the gills, and the _opercula_, or covers which\r\nclose over the branchial apertures,--and of the vertebral column,\r\nformed of numerous dorsal and caudal vertebræ, with the ribs and other\r\nappendages; there are no proper cervical vertebræ, or spinal bones of\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nThe branchial arches are in general four or five on each side, and are\r\nattached above to the cranium, and below to a chain of small bones, by\r\nwhich they are connected with the _os hyoides_, or bone of the tongue.\r\nThe opercular bones, composing the cover or lid of the opening of the\r\ngills, consist of three pieces on each side, and are distinguished by\r\nthe names, _opercular_, _pre-opercular_, and _sub-opercular_, according\r\nto the situations which they respectively occupy.\r\n\r\nThe _vertebræ_ are double hollow cones,[514] not unlike an hour-glass\r\nin form: the interval between two of these bones is filled up, in the\r\nliving state, by a gelatinous fluid. Along the upper part of each\r\nvertebra, there is an annular cavity, which in the united vertebral\r\ncolumn forms a canal for the spinal marrow; the posterior dorsal and\r\ncaudal vertebæ have also a channel below, for the passage of the large\r\nblood-vessels.\r\n\r\n[514] There are certain exceptions; thus in the _Lepidosteus_ the\r\nvertebral column is a series of ball-and-socket joints, the convexity\r\nbeing anterior, as in the land Salamander, and in the fossil reptile\r\nknown as the Streptospondylus.\r\n\r\nThere are likewise bones analogous to some of those which enter into\r\nthe composition of the extremities, chest or thorax, and pelvis of\r\nthe higher vertebrata; but which it is not necessary for our present\r\npurpose here to describe.\r\n\r\nOf the organs of vision some fossil remains also occur. The sclerotic\r\ncoat, or capsule of the eye, being bony in fishes, is often preserved;\r\nand in several chalk specimens I have found it occupying the orbit.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those durable parts of fishes, already mentioned, as\r\nlikely to be met with in a fossil state, the bones called _otolithes_\r\n(ear-stones) must be enumerated. These calcareous bodies are found in\r\nthe membranous labyrinth of the organs of hearing; and, although more\r\nor less developed in the ear-bulb of all animals, they are larger and\r\nof more definite forms in the higher osseous and cartilaginous fishes.\r\nThe _otolithes_ are supposed to assist in communicating more vivid\r\nimpressions of sounds to the extremities of the auditory nerves; they\r\nare stony in most aquatic animals, and friable or pulverulent in those\r\nthat live on land. Smooth, oblong otolithes are not uncommon in the\r\nCrag deposits of Norfolk and Suffolk; and minute ear-bones are found in\r\nthe Barton Clay.\r\n\r\nTails of Fishes.--The tail, as we have previously mentioned, is the\r\nchief instrument of progressive motion in these animals; it assumes two\r\nprincipal modifications. In the greater number of the existing species\r\nthe vertebral column terminates in a triangular plate of bone (formed\r\nby the fusion of the last few vertebræ), to which the caudal fin is\r\nattached symmetrically; and its figure is either rounded, or divided\r\ninto two equal lobes or branches; these tails are termed _homocercal_,\r\ni. e. even-tail. In the second modification the vertebral column\r\ntowards its extremity diverges from a straight line, rises up, and is\r\nprolonged into the upper lobe of the tail; the caudal fin appearing\r\nlike a rudder, and its low’er lobe, being destitute of vertebræ, is\r\nproportionably very feeble and small, as in the Shark and Dog-fish:\r\nthis form of tail is called _heterocercal_, i. e. unequal-tail (see\r\n_Foss. Brit. Mus._ p. 421; and _Ly._ figs. 340, 341). In the embryonic\r\nstate the tail in all fishes is heterocercal, and it becomes homocercal\r\nin the progress of development in those genera which have this type\r\nof the caudal appendage. But few of the existing species have the\r\nheterocercal tail, while it is found in all the fossil fishes that\r\noccur in the ancient secondary strata; namely, the Magnesian limestone,\r\nand antecedent deposits. The rounded and equal-bilobed, or homocercal,\r\ntails, are seen in the fishes from the Chalk, _Wond._ pp. 347, &c.; and\r\nin the Wealden Lepidotus, _Lign. 186_; and the unequal or heterocercal\r\ntail is shown in the Amblypterus from the Carboniferous strata, _Lign.\r\n187_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 186.

Amblypterus. _Carboniferous._ (1/4 _nat.\r\nsize_.)\r\n\r\n_a._ The heterocercal tail.]\r\n\r\nIn the Annals of Nat. Hist, for 1848, p. 304, Prof. M’Coy has described\r\nand figured an intermediate form of tail, which he regards as\r\ncharacteristic of the _Diplopterus_ (of the Old Red Sandstone) and its\r\nallies: this the Professor terms the _Diphycercal_ tail.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief summary of the essential characters of those durable\r\nparts of the organization of fishes, which most frequently occur in\r\na fossil state, we pass to the investigation of some illustrative\r\nexamples of this class of organic remains. But before describing any\r\nentire specimens, it will be expedient to notice the separate fins,\r\nand teeth, which abound in many deposits; in some instances occurring\r\nin connexion with other parts of the skeleton, but more generally\r\ndetached, and constituting the only evidence of the existence of\r\nnumerous extinct species and genera. The greater part belong to\r\nthe first order--the Placoidians (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. iii.), and\r\nto the families of _Sharks_ and _Rays_. The osseous dorsal rays of\r\ncartilaginous fishes (named _Ichthyodorulites_ (_fossil-fish-weapons_)\r\nby Dr. Buckland and Sir H. De la Beche) first demand our notice.\r\n\r\nIchthyodorulites. _Lign. 188._--This name is applied to the fossil\r\nspines, or rays, of dorsal fins, of which numerous species occur in\r\nthe Secondary deposits; they belong, for the most part, to extinct\r\ncartilaginous fishes of the _Cestracionidæ_ and _Hybodontidæ_ groups.\r\nIn the osseous tribes the dorsal spines have at their base two\r\narticular processes, by which they are united to the osselets that\r\nsupport them, as in the _Silurus_; but in the cartilaginous, they have\r\nno articulations at the base, and terminate in an obtuse point, which\r\nis implanted in the flesh; the posterior margin is grooved almost to\r\nthe upper extremity. They are of a fibrous, osseous texture. The common\r\nSpinax, or Dog-fish (_Acanthias vulgaris_), has a spine of this kind in\r\nthe front of each dorsal fin. The rays of the Sharks are compressed,\r\nand some have rows of teeth on the posterior margin; in the genus\r\n_Cestracion_ (Port-Jackson Shark), these organs are strong, triangular,\r\nstraight, pointed, rounded in front, flat at the posterior face, and\r\nwidest at the base; in the Hays they are flattened or depressed.\r\n\r\nThese spines are generally capable of being elevated and depressed, and\r\nnot only serve the purpose of defence, but, in many instances, afford\r\nsupport and protection to the soft rays of the fin; forming, as it\r\nwere, a moveable mast, by which the sail can be spread out or lowered\r\nat pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this subject, I would first direct attention to the\r\nbeautiful fossil, figured _Lign. 188, fig. 1_, which was discovered\r\nin the Chalk near Lewes, and is figured, of the natural size, _Foss.\r\nSouth D._ tab. xxxix. This ray, or spine, belongs to one of the\r\nCestraciont fishes (_Ptychodus_), whose teeth are so abundant in the\r\nChalk, and will presently be described. It is composed of fourteen\r\nthick, flat, osseous rods, or strands, intimately united together, with\r\nlongitudinal furrows or sutures on the surface. The anterior margin is\r\nembossed, and the projections form on the sides wide, rounded ribs, and\r\ntransverse depressions. Towards the base of the posterior part, there\r\nare large osseous fibres inserted vertically and obliquely, which\r\nappear to have been processes of attachment. The rods, or plates, are\r\nparallel With the posterior margin, and each terminates in a rounded\r\nextremity, or boss, on the front edge of the spine. This ray is wider\r\nat its base than at the superior part the anterior margin is oblique,\r\nand the posterior straight. The surface, where entire, is covered with\r\na dense osseous substance, which is finely engrailed.[515]\r\n\r\n[515] This specimen is figured in _Poiss. Foss._; but it is represented\r\ntoo short, from the two portions being drawn as if they were connected,\r\nwithout any interval between them, as in _Lign. 188._ It is in the\r\nBritish Museum. See _Petrifactions_, p. 450.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 188.

A nearly entire fin-ray\r\nof this species, three feet in length, has recently been discovered by\r\nMr. Charles Potter, of Lewes, in the Chalk near that town. The remains\r\nof another ray, of equal proportions, were found near it; and these\r\ndorsal spines might have belonged to the same individual, for there are\r\nno reasons to forbid the supposition that the Ptychodus had two dorsal\r\nfin-rays. The length of these spines necessarily indicates a very large\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nA smaller species of Ichthyodorulite, also found in the Lewes Chalk, is\r\ndistinguished from _P. spectabilis_ by its osseous plates contracting\r\ntowards their extremities, and terminating more suddenly on the front\r\nmargin, producing gibbosities less acute and more distant than in _P.\r\nspectabilis_; this species is named _P. gibberulus_: see _Lign. 188,\r\nfig. 2_.[516]\r\n\r\n[516] This fossil is figured of the natural size, Foss. South D. pl.\r\nxl. _fig._ 3.\r\n\r\nThe bony plates of these fins are occasionally found lying in irregular\r\ngroups in the Chalk, as if the fin had partially decomposed and the\r\nplates separated. In one example, the rays are split asunder by a\r\npiece of bone, apparently a portion of a long pointed tooth, firmly\r\nimpacted between them; as if the fish had been seized by some enemy,\r\nand had escaped, with the tooth of its adversary in its fin. Very fine\r\nspecimens have been found at Charing, Kent, by W. Harris, Esq. F.G.S.\r\n\r\nIn the fragment of an Ichthyodorulite from the Lewes Chalk, a\r\nremarkable structure is displayed; the osseous plates are united\r\nlaterally by smooth, longitudinal lines, as in those above described;\r\nbut they are also traversed by numerous oblique, finely-serrated\r\nsutures. _Lign. 188, fig. 1a_.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk contains rays of other species of _Ptychodus_, as well as of\r\nsome allied genera. Of these, the most remarkable are smooth, arched,\r\npointed spines, having a shallow posterior groove, with an enamelled\r\nsurface, marked with fine longitudinal striæ, and frequent, parallel,\r\noblique lines. These, according to Sir P. Egerton, belong to a true\r\n_Cestracion_ (see p. 584): they were first figured and described by me\r\n(_Foss. South D._ tab. xxxiii. _fig._ 5) as belonging to the _Acanthias\r\nmajor_, and were subsequently assigned to the genus _Spinax_ by Prof.\r\nAgassiz (_Poiss. Foss._ iii. p. 62).\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to remark, that the fins first described have been\r\nreferred to the fishes which yielded the large grooved teeth so common\r\nin the Chalk (see _Pl. VI fig. 2_) in consequence of their affinity\r\nto existing species, which have similar fins and teeth; and from the\r\ncircumstance that the Sharks of the genus _Lamna_, whose teeth also\r\nabound in the Chalk, have no dorsal rays of this kind; still the\r\nproof of identity remains to be discovered. In one specimen only have\r\nI observed indications of any other part of the skeleton; it is a\r\nspine of _Acanthias major_, the base of which rests on several dorsal\r\nvertebræ (_Foss. South D._ tab. xxxiii.).\r\n\r\nHybodus subcarinatus. _Lign. 188, fig. 3._--The fishes of another\r\nextinct genus of Sharks, termed _Hybodus_, from the gibbous form of\r\nthe teeth, were also provided with dorsal spines, which may be readily\r\ndistinguished from the preceding. These Ichthyodorulites are generally\r\nlong, slightly arched, and terminate in a point at the extremity; the\r\nbase, which was implanted in the flesh, is deeply grooved, and much\r\nprolonged, being sometimes equal to one-third of the entire length.\r\nThe surface is marked with strong longitudinal ridges, parallel with\r\nthe anterior margin which is rounded and laterally compressed. The\r\nposterior edge, which is more or less flat, has, towards the base two\r\nrows of sharp arched teeth, which gradually approach ’each other, and\r\nblend into one line on the upper part of the ray There are numerous\r\nspecies of this genus in the Oolite and Lias. I have found one species\r\nin the Chalk and a few in the Wealden. The small Ray figured _Lign.\r\n188 fig. 3_, is from Tilgate Forest, and displays the usual characters\r\nof these fossils. From specimens discovered in the Lias, associated\r\nwith the teeth, it appears that the _Hybodus_ had two dorsal fins, each\r\nfurnished with rays, as in the recent Dog-fish.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of these rays is stated by M. Agassiz to\r\nresemble that of the teeth: in some there is a pulp cavity, which\r\noccupies the centre of the spine, and is surrounded by dentine, in\r\nwhich the calcigerous tubes radiate direct to the surface; the external\r\nenamel is a layer of dentine, in which the medullary canals are wanting.\r\n\r\nIn the strata below the Lias there are numerous Ichthyodorulites, some\r\nof a large size, belonging chiefly to the Cestracion family, and of\r\nextinct species, not observed in more recent deposits. Thus there are\r\nseveral species of dorsal rays (named Onchus, from their hooked form,)\r\nthat are wide at the base, and bent backwards, with the posterior\r\nmargin destitute of teeth, in the Carboniferous, Devonian, and Silurian\r\nformations; also immense compressed spines, having small teeth on the\r\nposterior margin, and the surface covered with longitudinal striæ,\r\nand finely toothed, transversely; hence termed Ctenacanthus, or\r\npectinated-spine (_Murch. Sil. Syst._ p. 596).\r\n\r\nThe fossil spine, named Orthacanthus (_Poiss. Foss._ vol. iii. pl.\r\nxlv.), and found in the Coal of Manchester, has been discovered in\r\nconnexion with the body of the fish to which it belonged in the\r\nCarboniferous deposits of Ruppersdorf in Bohemia (_Geol. Journal_, vol.\r\nv. part ii. p. 23).\r\n\r\nSome Ichthyodorulites have the surface richly ornamented with stellular\r\ntubercles, and are termed Asteracanthus, or starry-spine; there are\r\nvery large fin-rays of this kind in the Wealden, Purbeck, Oolites, and\r\nLias.[517]\r\n\r\n[517] For particular information on Ichthyodorulites, consult _Poiss.\r\nFoss._ tom. iii. chap. i. About seventy species are enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyodorulites of the _Rays_ have no cavity like those of the\r\n_Sharks_, and are of a depressed form, and more or less flattened; they\r\nare armed with teeth along their exterior margins, and not on the\r\nposterior edge, as in the latter family.\r\n\r\nFossil Teeth of Fishes.--From the durable nature and striking appearance\r\nof many of the fossil teeth of fishes, and their prodigious numbers in\r\nsome deposits, they are familiar objects to the collector. By far the\r\nlargest proportion of the detached teeth belongs to various species\r\nand genera of that most numerous, and widely distributed family of\r\nvoracious fishes, the Sharks. In the Tertiary strata teeth of this\r\nkind occur of a very large size; in the Chalk many species abound,\r\nparticularly of the lanceolate and compressed forms, and of the rugous,\r\nmammillated, palatal teeth, commonly termed _palates_. As we pass\r\nto the more ancient formations, teeth of different forms prevail;\r\nand those which approach the recent types are either very rare or\r\naltogether absent. We will select some examples of the different genera\r\nin illustration of this subject; the previous observations on the form\r\nand structure of the recent teeth render but few introductory remarks\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFossil Teeth of Sharks.--The fishes of the Shark and Ray families\r\nbelong to the _Placoid_ order; the scales in the former consist of\r\nenamelled plates and tubercles, forming a _shagreen_ surface; and in\r\nthe dermal integument of the latter they appear as spines and bosses,\r\nirregularly disposed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the diversity in appearance of the teeth of Sharks,\r\nthey all possess one essential character of structure, namely, a\r\nbase, or osseous root of variable form, which is implanted in the\r\ninteguments; and a crown, or external portion, which projects into the\r\nmouth, is covered with enamel or compact dentine, and assumes numerous\r\nmodifications, by which the fossil genera are characterized. These\r\nteeth are never imbedded in sockets, nor united to the dentary margins\r\nof the jaws; they only adhere to the integuments of the mouth, and the\r\ncovering of the maxillæ; they possess, in most of the Sharks, great\r\nmobility. They are generally disposed in rows; the anterior ones,\r\nbeing first used, fall out, and are replaced by those on the inner\r\nseries. New teeth are also continually formed behind those in use, and\r\nadvance successively towards the anterior rows as the latter are shed,\r\nand in their turn occupy the front rank. (See Cyclop. Anat. _Art._\r\nTeeth.) An examination of the fossil and recent teeth of Sharks and\r\nRays proves that the prevailing existing generic types have but few, if\r\nany, representatives in the fossils, except in those which belong to\r\nthe Tertiary and Cretaceous formations; while the genera that appear\r\nisolated, as it were, in the present seas have numerous analogues in\r\nthe Secondary strata.\r\n\r\nThe fossil teeth of this family may be divided into two grand\r\ndivisions; namely, those which are more or less of a polygonal,\r\nobtusely conical, or depressed form, having a tesselated arrangement in\r\nthe mouth; and those of a triangular, lanceolate shape, with cutting,\r\nor serrated edges, disposed in a series of rows on the jaws. The teeth\r\nof the first group (_Cestracionidæ_) have most analogy to those of the\r\nliving genus Cestracion (_Port-Jackson Shark_); the second (_Sgualidæ_)\r\nto the Sharks, commonly so called.\r\n\r\nThe Cestracion is the only living representative of a family of\r\nsqualoid fishes of a peculiar type, whose remains occur in almost the\r\nearliest fossiliferous deposits; it inhabits the seas of New Holland\r\nand the southern coasts of China. The jaws of the Cestracion are\r\nrelatively very large, and are armed with numerous rows of teeth,\r\nessentially of two kinds; those situated anteriorly, or towards the\r\nfront of the mouth, being adapted for seizing and retaining the food,\r\nand the posterior ones for crushing and bruising. The prehensile teeth\r\nare sharp, angular, and pointed: the others are obtuse, polygonal,\r\nenamelled, and disposed in oblique rows along the margins and inner\r\nsurface of both jaws; there are sometimes sixty in each jaw (see\r\n_Bd._ ii. pl. xxvii 11. _fig._ A). Fossil teeth of this type are\r\nexceedingly numerous in the Chalk, Lias, &c. but are very seldom found\r\nin juxtaposition; the decomposition of the cartilaginous integuments\r\nin which they are imbedded, having, in most examples, occasioned their\r\ndisplacement and dispersion; specimens, however, are occasionally\r\ndiscovered, in which numerous teeth, of various sizes, are disposed in\r\nmosaic, in their natural relative positions.\r\n\r\nThe extinct forms of this family (_Cestracionidæ_) are known almost\r\nonly by their teeth; and according to the shape, structure, and\r\nsculpture of these organs, M. Agassiz has arranged them into several\r\ngenera. They occur in most of the fossiliferous deposits.\r\n\r\nCestracion canaliculatus.--The teeth of a fish belonging to the\r\nexisting genus have been discovered in the Chalk of Kent; they are\r\nfigured and described by Sir P. Egerton in the beautiful work by Mr.\r\nDixon.[518] This unique specimen consists of a group of thirteen\r\nposterior molar and three or four detached prehensile anterior teeth,\r\nimbedded in a block of chalk about two inches square. The chief\r\ndistinction from the teeth of the recent Cestracion is in the presence\r\nof a large medullary canal which traverses the base of each tooth:\r\nhence the specific name.\r\n\r\n[518] Dixon’s Fossils of Sussex, &c. p. 365, tab. xxxii. _fig._ 8. From\r\nthe t examination of a specimen lately found at Lewes, Sir P. Egerton\r\nhas been led to assign to this species the spine formerly described as\r\n_Spinax major_.\r\n\r\nAcrodus (_ridge-tooth_) nobilis. _Lign. 189, fig. 4_, _Ly._ p. 275,\r\n_fig._ 307.--In the Lias and Oolite, oblong enamelled teeth, having the\r\nsurface of the crown covered with fine radiating grooves and striæ,\r\nare well known to collectors, in many parts of England, by the name of\r\n_fossil leeches_, from a fancied resemblance to a contracted leech.\r\nThey belong to an extinct genus of Cestracionts, named _Acrodus_ by\r\nM. Agassiz. The crown of the tooth is enamelled, and covered with\r\ntransverse grooves, which diverge from a longitudinal furrow; the\r\nbase is in the form of a parallelogram inclined on its inner side.\r\nThese teeth were inserted along the jaws in oblique series, their\r\nlongitudinal direction corresponding with that of the bones which\r\nsupported them; in their natural position, the extremity of a hinder\r\ntooth was enclosed between the two next anterior teeth. A beautiful\r\ngroup is figured _Bd._ ii. pl. xxvii^_e_.[519]\r\n\r\n[519] The microscopical structure of the teeth of _Acrodus_ is well\r\nshown in the \"Odontography,\" pl. xiv. xv., and beautifully illustrates\r\nthe relation of dentine to bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 189.

A very common form is figured\r\n_Pl. VI. fig. 2_; and microscopic views of vertical and transverse\r\nsections, as seen by transmitted light, are shown in figs. 2^_b_,\r\n2^_c_. Groups of these teeth, somewhat naturally arranged, and varying\r\nin size and form according to the situations they occupied in the\r\njaws, are occasionally found: one specimen in the British Museum, and\r\nformerly in my collection, contains more than 120 teeth. In general\r\nthey occur in a very perfect state, with the osseous base and enamelled\r\ncrown entire. The dorsal rays or spines previously described (p. 577),\r\nare sometimes found with the teeth, and belong to fishes of the same\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nThese teeth are of an angular form, and more or less square, the crown\r\nis wider than the root, which is obtuse, truncated, and depressed in\r\nthe centre; the enamelled part of the tooth is expanded at the edges,\r\nand forms in the centre a flattened or slightly convex mammillary\r\nprojection, which is traversed by large, acute, transverse, parallel\r\nridges. The borders are granulated, and the sides of the projection\r\nmarked with deep vertical plicæ or folds; this description particularly\r\napplies to the species named _P. polygurus_, figured in _Plate VI._ Dr.\r\nBuckland has represented a fine group of these teeth, _Bd._ ii. pl.\r\nxxvi′. Another common species (_P. decurrens_) is distinguished from\r\nthe former by the connexion between the large furrows on the crown and\r\nthe granulations on the expanded border, which diverge from the outer\r\nedge of the large folds to the margin of the enamel.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic structure of these teeth presents the same congeries of\r\nmedullary and calcigerous tubes as those of the recent Cestracion: see\r\n_Plate VI. figs. 2^b, 2^c_.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of a species of Ptychodus occur in the arenaceous strata\r\nof the Chalk-formation in New Jersey, which possess the essential\r\ncharacters of the European types, but differ from them in their\r\nconfiguration; the only specimen I have seen is figured _Lign. 189,\r\nfig. 1_; it was presented to me by Dr. Morton. The enamelled crown\r\nforms a conical projection, traversed by large inosculating ridges,\r\nwhich radiate from the summit towards the margin.[520]\r\n\r\n[520] I have named it _P. Mortoni_, in honour of my distinguished\r\nfriend, the eminent American naturalist and physician, Dr. George\r\nMorton, of Philadelphia, by whom it was discovered.\r\n\r\nPsammodus[521] (_sandy-tooth_). _Pl. VI. fig. 1_; _Lign. 128, fig.\r\n2_.--To this genus are referred the fossil teeth of the extinct\r\nCestracionts, which have the crown formed of small vertical tubes,\r\nwith the grinding surface more or less smooth, and presenting only a\r\npunctated or sandy appearance.[522] These teeth are generally flat or\r\nslightly convex, and of a square or oblong form; the base is osseous,\r\nand as large as the crown. Two species are figured, _Lign. 189, fig.\r\n2_, and _Pl. VI. fig. 1^a_. A magnified vertical section of the crown,\r\ndisplaying the medullary canals and radiating calcigerous tubes, is\r\nrepresented _Pl. VI. fig. 1^b_, and a transverse section, _fig. 1^c_;\r\nthey are thin slices of a tooth, _P. porosus_, from the Black Rock\r\n(Mountain Limestone), near Clifton, viewed by transmitted light. The\r\nlarge, flat, quadrilateral, oblong teeth that abound in the Stonesfield\r\nSlate belong to the _Strophodus magnus_.\r\n\r\n[521] See Odontography, pl. xviii. xix.\r\n\r\n[522] Ibid. vol. i. p. 59.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of fossil teeth which possess the same\r\nessential structure as those of Psammodus, but differ in their\r\nexternal characters; these are referred to other genera by M. Agassiz.\r\nThus Orodus, _Lign. 189, fig. 3_, comprises those elongated teeth\r\nin which the centre of the crown forms an obtuse transverse cone,\r\ntraversed by a ridge from which oblique furrows diverge transversely\r\ntowards the circumference. Similar teeth, but with a smooth, obtusely\r\nconical crown, are referred to the genus Helodus. Those with the\r\ncrown compressed and elevated, with a sharp edge, and with the base\r\nsurrounded by concentric folds, constitute the type of Chomatodes.\r\nA similar crown, but subdivided by deep transverse ridges into\r\ndentations, characterises the genus Ctenoptychius.\r\n\r\nCeratodus (_horn-tooth_) emarginatus. _Lign. 194, fig. 1._--Very\r\ncurious dental organs, possessing a structure analogous to that of\r\nthe teeth of Psammodus, are found in the Bone-bed of the Lias; they\r\nconsist of consolidated plates instead of separate teeth; there was\r\nprobably but one plate on each side the jaws. The upper margin is\r\ngenerally undulated, and more or less worn by use. These dental plates\r\nare composed of two distinct layers; the lowermost portion, or root, is\r\nan osseous, reticulated tissue, as in cartilaginous fishes in general;\r\nand the upper consists of dentine, with minute parallel vertical tubes,\r\nas in Psammodus; these tubes are a continuation of the medullary tissue\r\nof the osseous root.\r\n\r\nOne species occurs in the Great Oolite at Stonesfield, and very many\r\nforms abound in the Bone-bed at Aust Cliff, near Westbury on Avon: and\r\nin the Trias (bone-bed) of Germany the teeth of several species of\r\nCeratodus are very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe fishes to which these fossil teeth, referred to _Ceratodus_,\r\nbelonged were most probably Cestracionts; the ray-spine known as\r\n_Nemacanthus_ is provisionally assigned to them.\r\n\r\nEdaphodon. _Lign. 190_ and _Lign. 191_, _Ly._ p. 276, _fig._ 309.--The\r\nChimæroid fishes, though formerly placed with the Plagiostomes (Sharks\r\nand Bays), constitute a distinct group, of which there are but two\r\nrecent genera, though several occur in a fossil state. Their dental\r\norgans are very peculiar. Their mandibles are furnished with two\r\nor more pairs of oblong teeth, composed of long hollow cylindrical\r\ncolumns, placed nearly at right angles to the grinding surface, which\r\nis pitted with minute depressions. These teeth are never shed, but are\r\npersistent, and grow on through life, as in the Rodentia, exhibiting in\r\nthis respect a striking contrast with those of the Sharks, which are\r\nfeeble and numerous, and constantly replaced by rows of successional\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nFossil teeth of several species, some much larger than the recent,\r\nhave been found in the Tertiary, Cretaceous, and Oolitic deposits. The\r\nfirst British specimen was discovered in the Chalk-marl at Hamsey, in\r\n1820, by myself; but its nature was not suspected until more perfect\r\nexamples were obtained from the Kimmeridge Clay at Shotover by Sir\r\nP. Egerton, and were submitted to Dr. Buckland, who subsequently\r\nascertained their characters and relations by an examination of\r\nthe dental organs of a recent _Chimæra_ in the Museum at Leyden in\r\n1835.[523]\r\n\r\n[523] Proceedings of the Geological Society of London, vol. ii. p. 209.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 190.

Sussex.\r\n\r\nIn some species the external vertical wall of the plate is formed of\r\nhard dentine, resembling enamel; in others the dentine is disposed\r\nin isolated ramifications, producing a dendritical appearance; the\r\nmodifications of this structure occasion the differences observable\r\nin the dental plates of the various species. In some, compact dentine\r\nwith parallel canals constitutes the mass of the tooth; in others, the\r\nsquamous dentine with ramifying tubes prevails.\r\n\r\nI have figured the right upper and lower mandibles of the type named\r\nEdaphodon (_pavement-tooth_), in which there are _three_ teeth or\r\ndental tubercles on each ramus of both jaws, _Lign. 191_: the lower\r\nmandible is produced anteriorly into a falciform beak:[525] the\r\narticulating surface of the symphysis (2 _s_) is broad at the base,\r\nand contracts gradually forward until the margins meet at the apex. In\r\n_Ischyodus_ the lower jaw is deeper, less produced in front, and the\r\nmargins of the symphysis are parallel until abruptly truncated at the\r\nextremities: the upper jaw has _four_ tubercles on each side.\r\n\r\n[525] Hence M. Agassiz proposed the name of _Psittacodon_\r\n(parrot-tooth) for this genus of Chimæroids.\r\n\r\nThe upper jaw in Elasmodus has but three tubercles, as in Edaphodon,\r\nbut the dentine of which they are composed is confluent, being rolled\r\nround like a scroll in the substance of the bone, one edge forming the\r\nmargin of the tooth, and the other being buried deep in its centre.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal fin-ray or spine of the Edaphodon is laterally compressed,\r\nwith the posterior margin grooved, and the edges armed with fine teeth:\r\nI have a specimen of the spine, with a pair of inferior mandibles of\r\nthe same individual, imbedded in a block of chalk from Kent; by favour\r\nof Mrs. Smith, of Tunbridge Wells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 192.

Agassiz has arranged in a sub-family\r\nor group termed _Hybodonts_; the teeth of which are characterised\r\nby their transversely elongated form, and the series of subacute,\r\ncompressed, conical cusps or points, which compose the crown. The\r\nmedian cone is the principal, the lateral points being shorter and\r\nsmaller, as in _Lign. 192, fig. 2_; in some species the difference\r\nbetween the median and lateral cones is greater, in others less, as\r\nin _fig. 1_. These cusps have a coating of dense enamel, which is\r\nplicated longitudinally on both faces. The base, which almost equals\r\nthe crown in size, is composed of a coarse osseous substance. The\r\ninternal structure of the crown differs from that of the Cestracionts,\r\nin having no principal pulp-cavity, and in being chiefly composed of\r\ndendritical dentine, with reticulated medullary canals. The form and\r\norganization of these teeth show them to have been instruments for\r\ncutting and tearing food. The Hybodonts, as we have already stated (p.\r\n581), possessed two spinous dorsal fins; in their habits and economy\r\nthey probably did not differ from the ordinary Sharks. Teeth and spines\r\nof this genus are common in the Trias, Lias, Oolite, and Walden, and\r\noccur in the Green Sand and Chalk. There are several species of teeth\r\nand fins in the strata of Tilgate Forest (_Foss. Til. For._ pl. x.).\r\nIn general the teeth are found detached, but occasionally they occur\r\nin their natural position, adhering to the mineralized cartilaginous\r\njaws (_Petrif. Lign. 97_); as in the beautiful fossil figured _Bd._\r\npl. xxvii.^_d_; and in the fine specimen of _H. basanus_, from the Isle\r\nof Wight, figured in the _Geol. Soc. Journ._ vol. pl. iv. There are\r\nseveral related genera, founded on the situation, form, and division of\r\nthe principal cusps of the teeth.\r\n\r\nSharks with Cutting Teeth.--The jaws of the common squaloid fishes, as\r\nthe Lamna (_Porbeagle_) and Carcharias (_Great White Shark_), are so\r\ncommon in collections of natural history, as to render a description\r\nunnecessary. The numerous vertical rows of angular, laterally\r\ncompressed, pointed teeth, with sharp or serrated edges--in some\r\nspecies consisting of a simple trenchant cusp, in others with small\r\nlateral teeth, or denticles, at the base, are characters with which all\r\nare familiar. Fossil teeth of this form are extremely abundant in the\r\nTertiary and Cretaceous deposits; and are commonly in a beautiful state\r\nof preservation. The genera of these fossil teeth are founded on the\r\nsolidity or hollow structure of the cusps, their possessing cutting or\r\nserrated edges, and the presence or absence of lateral denticles. But\r\nthe last character cannot in every instance be relied upon, for some\r\nrecent Sharks have rows of teeth both with and without denticles.\r\n\r\nCarcharodon productus. _Lign. 192, fig 3._--The genus Carcharias\r\ncomprises the large Sharks with cutting triangular teeth, crenated\r\n(_notched_) on their margins, and having a broad base. In\r\n_Carcharodon_, the teeth differ from those of Carcharias in being solid\r\nin the centre, while in the latter they are hollow; but in both genera\r\nthe teeth exhibit the same reticulated structure of medullary and\r\ncalcigerous tubes. The _White Shark_ and other large species belong to\r\nthese genera; some of which are upwards of forty feet in length. But\r\neven these colossal fishes must have been far surpassed in magnitude\r\nby the extinct species of the Tertiary deposits, if the teeth afford\r\na scale of proportions; for some of the fossil teeth from Malta and\r\nthe United States are six inches long, and five wide at the base;[526]\r\nbeing twice the size of the teeth in the largest living species. The\r\nspecimen figured in illustration, _Lign. 192, fig. 3_, is of a small\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n[526] For instance, some of the Maryland specimens of _Carcharodon\r\nmegalodon_. See an admirable memoir on the Fossil Squalidæ of the\r\nUnited States, by Dr. R. W. Gibbes, Journ. Acad. Nat. Science,\r\nPhiladelphia. At the meeting of the British Association in 1851, J.\r\nS. Bowerbank, Esq. F.R.S. read some interesting observations on the\r\ncomparison of these large fossil fishes with the recent _Carcharias\r\nglaucus_ of Australia. See also Owen, Cyclop. Anat. _Art._ Teeth.\r\n\r\nHemipristis serra. _Lign. 192, fig 4._--The fossil teeth of this genus\r\nare distinguished by serrated edges, that do not extend to the summit,\r\nwhich is a sharp angular point; as in the fossil represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 193.

Several species\r\nabound in the Chalk; and they are associated with teeth, which are\r\nrelatively wider and shorter, and have large compressed denticles; the\r\nlatter are arranged in a separate genus, named Otodus (_eared-tooth_),\r\nby M. Agassiz. The specimen figured _Lign. 192, fig. 5_, represents\r\n_O. obliquus_; another species, _Otodus appendiculatus_, is abundant\r\nin the Sussex Chalk. The large, wide, triangular, smooth teeth, with\r\ntrenchant edges, and destitute of lateral denticles, so common in the\r\nChalk, are related to Lamna, and are comprised in the genus _Oxyrhina_\r\n(_Poiss. Foss._ tom. v. tab. xxxiii.).\r\n\r\nNotidanus microdon. _Lign. 193, fig. 3._--These teeth differ\r\nremarkably from those of the other genera of Sharks. The crown of each\r\ntooth is composed of a series of sharp angular enamelled points, the\r\nfirst of which is the largest, and is notched on its anterior edge; the\r\nbase or root is osseous, flat, with a slight longitudinal depression\r\nbelow the border of enamel. These teeth are comparatively rare in the\r\nChalk. One species has been found in the Oxford Clay; and several in\r\nthe Tertiary strata. Specimens occur in Hordwell Cliff.\r\n\r\nCorax pristodontus. _Lign. 193, fig. 1._--The teeth of the fossil\r\n_Corax_ chiefly differ from those of the recent genus _Galeus_, to\r\nwhich the _Tope_, or Grey Shark, belongs, in being solid; they are of\r\na triangular form, with a deep concavity or notch on the posterior\r\nmargin, the base of which is prolonged and forms three or four angular\r\npoints: the anterior edge of the tooth is finely serrated. The root of\r\nthe tooth, as in _Notidanus_, is a broad osseous plate. There is much\r\ndiversity of form in the Chalk specimens, which are all of a small\r\nsize, as in _Lign. 193, fig. 1_. In Sussex they are more common in\r\nthe Chalk-marl than in the Chalk.\r\n\r\nThe only fossil teeth of the Shark family resembling those of the\r\ntertiary Carchariodonts, that have been discovered in the strata below\r\nthe Chalk, are from the carboniferous deposits of Yorkshire and Armagh.\r\nThese teeth are compressed, triangular, crenated on the edges, with\r\nlarge plaits or folds on the enamelled surface, towards the base of the\r\ncrown. M. Agassiz refers them to a new genus, viz. Carcharopsis, with\r\nthe specific name of _Prototypus_.\r\n\r\nFossil Vertebræ of Sharks.--As the cartilaginous nature of the\r\nskeleton in this family renders it unfavourable to preservation in the\r\nmineral kingdom, the durable parts already described, and those which\r\nare ossified, are almost the only relics found in a fossil state.\r\nThe dermal integument is, however, sometimes preserved; and I had a\r\nbeautiful example of shagreen, composed of irregular minute hexagonal\r\nscales, one of which is represented highly magnified, _Lign. 185,\r\nfig. 1_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Galeus_ and _Carcharias_ the vertebræ are more ossified than\r\nin many other genera of cartilaginous fishes, and fossil vertebræ of\r\nthese sharks often occur in the cretaceous and other strata. Groups of\r\nvertebræ of a large size occasionally occur in the Sussex Chalk; they\r\nare circular, biconcave, and very short; one specimen is four inches\r\nin diameter, and one inch long; their concavities are consequently\r\nshallow. These vertebra: are composed of two shallow conical disks,\r\nwhich are united by their summits, at the axis, and are connected and\r\nsupported by numerous wedge-shaped plates, that radiate from the centre\r\nto the periphery (see _Foss. South D._ pl. xxxiii. _fig._ 10). My\r\ncollection contained a connected series of forty small vertebræ from\r\nthe Chalk near Lewes, which probably belonged to the same species of\r\nShark as the dorsal spine named _Spinax major_ (_Poiss. Foss._ tom.\r\niii. pl. xl^_a_ _fig._ 6).\r\n\r\nSqualoraia. In the Lias of Lyme Regis, that inexhaustible storehouse\r\nof fossil treasures, a considerable portion of the skeleton of a very\r\nremarkable fish, partaking of the characters of the Sharks and Rays,\r\nwas discovered by Miss Mary Aiming, and is now in the Museum of the\r\nBristol Institution.[527] In this fish the jaws are prolonged into a\r\nbeak, like the Pristis (_Saw-fish_). It has the head of a Shark, with\r\na long beak; vertebræ of the Rays; with pectoral and ventral fins,\r\nalmost equally developed; a tail armed with, a spine; and spinous\r\nbosses, as in the true Rays.\r\n\r\n[527] It is figured and described by Dr. Riley, Geol. Trans. 2d ser.\r\nvol. v. pl. iv. See also Poiss. Foss. tom. iii. pl. xlii.\r\n\r\nFossil Pristis, or Saw-fish.--This well-known predatory fish, which is\r\nallied to the Rays and Sharks, and referred by M. Agassiz to the family\r\nof _Raiidæ_, has projecting from its snout an osseous, flat, horizontal\r\nplate, or beak, equal in length to one-third of the fish, and armed on\r\neach side by a row of elongated, compressed, pointed teeth, implanted\r\nin sockets; the front margin of these teeth is convex, the posterior\r\nconcave; this defence is termed the saw, and constitutes a most\r\npowerful weapon. The _Pristis_ has also numerous small obtuse teeth on\r\nthe jaws. The remains of the beak, or saw, of an extinct species of\r\nPristis have been discovered in the Bagshot Sand at Goldsworth Hill,\r\nSurrey,[528] and three other species have been found in the London\r\nclay of the Isle of Sheppey, and the Eocene beds at Bracklesham and\r\nHordwell.[529]\r\n\r\n[528] Proc. Geol. Soc. vol. ii. p. 687.\r\n\r\n[529] Two teeth are figured in Dixon’s Fossils of Sussex, pl. xii.; the\r\nspecimens are in the British Museum; see _Petrifactions_, p. 414.\r\n\r\nFossil Rays.--The teeth of these fishes are characterised by the\r\nextraordinary transversal development of the median teeth in both\r\njaws. Instead of pointed teeth, they have wide, flat, tesselated\r\ndentary plates in each jaw, composed of distinct pieces, juxtaposed and\r\nconnected by their margins, and united by fine sutures. In some species\r\nthe teeth are equal, in others of various sizes; they present numerous\r\nmodifications of arrangement, and are always disposed in symmetrical\r\nrows. In the genus Myliobatis (_Eagle-ray_) the teeth of the median row\r\nare of an extraordinary width, while their length does not exceed that\r\nof the lateral plates, or chevrons, which are of an irregular hexagonal\r\nform, and disposed in two or three rows on each side. There are five\r\nliving species of _Myliobatis_, and eighteen fossil species have been\r\nfound in the Tertiary strata at the Isle of Sheppey, Hordwell Cliff,\r\nand Bracklesham Bay. I have figured a specimen of part of the upper\r\njaw of a species (_M. micropleurus_, _Lign. 194, fig. 2_), in which\r\nthe median teeth are very wide, and have two lateral rows of small,\r\nirregularly hexagonal, plates. The surface of the teeth in this species\r\nis smooth; but in others it is striated longitudinally (_Bd._ pl.\r\nxxvi^_d_. _fig._ 14). In an allied genus, Ætobatis, from the Tertiary\r\nbeds at Bracklesham, the lower jaw projects beyond the upper, and in\r\neach there is a row of flat, transverse teeth, _without_ lateral plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 194. Fossil Teeth of Fishes\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Ceratodus emarginatus: 1/2 _nat._ _Lias Bone-bed._ _Aust Cliff._\r\n           A single dental plate.\r\n       2.--Myliobatis micropleurus: 1/3 _nat._ _Tert._ _Isle of Sheppey._\r\n           A series of six median teeth, with the corresponding lateral\r\n           teeth.\r\n       3.--Pycnodus Mantelli. _Weald._ _Tilgate Forest._ This specimen\r\n           consists of the _vomerine_ bone, with a median row of flat,\r\n           arched teeth, and two rows on each side of elliptical teeth,\r\n           arranged alternately.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo this notice of the fossil Rays, we may add, that a gigantic Torpedo\r\nhas been discovered in that celebrated locality of Ichthyolites, Monte\r\nBolca: and that Sir Philip Egerton has recently enriched his matchless\r\ncollection of fossil fishes, by a perfect Ray, from Mount Lebanon. It\r\nis figured and described in the _Quarterly Geol. Journ._ vol. i. pl.\r\nv. p. 225, under the name of Cyclobatis oligodactylus. It is a small\r\nspecies, resembling the common Rays in its general appearance, but is\r\nsurrounded by a broad, flexible, cartilagino-membranous fin; the skin\r\nis smooth, the teeth and eyes are small, the tail is slender; there are\r\nno traces of dermal spines, tubercles, or defensive weapons. In many\r\npoints of structure it resembles the Torpedo; and may possibly, like\r\nthat fish, have possessed an electric organ. It is 3-1/2 inches long,\r\nand 3 inches wide across the expanded fins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL ICHTHYOLOGY; COMPRISING THE GANOID, CTENOID, AND CYCLOID FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fishes we have hitherto examined belong to the first order, the\r\n_Placoidians_; we now pass to the fossil remains of the second order,\r\nthe _Ganoidians_, which are distinguished by their brilliant angular\r\nscales, formed of osseous or horny plates, densely covered with enamel.\r\nThis order contains six or more families, comprising many genera and\r\nnumerous species; our investigation must be restricted to a selection\r\nfrom the principal genera of the _Ganoids_, properly so called, and of\r\nthe _Sauroids_, or lizard-like fishes.[530]\r\n\r\n[530] The fishes of these orders are described in _Poiss. Foss._ tom.\r\nii.\r\n\r\nThe first family, termed Lepidoides, contains several genera, which\r\nare defined as possessing either numerous rows of brush-teeth, or\r\nof obtuse conical teeth; flat, rhomboidal scales, arranged parallel\r\nwith the body; and an osseous, or partially osseous, skeleton. In one\r\ndivision of this family, the body is either elongated or fusiform, the\r\nmouth furnished with brash-teeth only, and the tail heterocercal, or\r\nunequally bilobed (see p. 576). To this group belong several genera,\r\nwhich are restricted to the Secondary formations more ancient than\r\nthe Oolite; while the other group, with homocercal tails, lived in\r\nthe Oolitic and Cretaceous seas. Two genera, in particular, abound\r\nin the Permian and Carboniferous strata; namely, _Amblypterus_ and\r\n_Palæoniscus_.[531]\r\n\r\n[531] For the characters, affinities, and distribution of these and the\r\nallied genera of the Heterocerque Ganoid fishes, see Sir P. Egerton’s\r\nMemoir in the sixth volume of the Quarterly Geological Journal.\r\n\r\nAmblypterus. _Lign. 187._ _Wond._ p. 740. _Bd._ pl. xxvii.^_b_.--The\r\nfishes of this genus, as the name indicates, have very large and wide\r\nfins, composed of numerous rays. The scales are rhomboidal and finely\r\nenamelled; the tail is heterocercal. The figures referred to convey a\r\ncorrect idea of the form and external characters. Beautiful pyritous\r\nimprints of Amblypteri occur in the Carboniferous slate of Saarbrück,\r\nin Lorraine; and fine specimens in the ironstone nodules of the same\r\nlocality. On the shore at Newhaven, near Leith, similar fossils occur\r\nin nodules washed out of the cliffs of coal-shale (_Bd._ p. 278).\r\n\r\nPalæoniscus. _Ly._ p. 304.--The fishes of this genus differ from\r\nthose of Amblypterus in the relatively moderate size of the scales,\r\nand the numerous little rays on their margins. They have rhomboidal\r\nscales, which in some species are very small, and in others large.\r\nThey have numerous brush-teeth. Several peculiar species, found in the\r\nmarl-slates and magnesian limestones of the Permian system, are very\r\nwidely distributed, occurring in the British Isles, Germany, and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the small species occur in groups; on a slab of\r\nred sandstone, in the Museum of the Geological Society, from Tyrone,\r\nbetween two and three hundred perfect fishes (_P. catopterus_) are\r\nimbedded on a space not exceeding two feet square.\r\n\r\nA remarkable circumstance relating to the fishes of this genus is the\r\nalmost constant absence of the bodies of the vertebræ in otherwise\r\nwell-preserved specimens, and in which the spinal processes and the\r\nribs are entire: occasionally, however, examples occur with some of the\r\nvertebræ perfect. An explanation of the above phenomenon may perhaps\r\nbe found in the probable originally cartilaginous nature of the bodies\r\nof the vertebræ, and the osseous structure of the enduring apophyses\r\nand ribs;[532] while those rare specimens which possess a few bony\r\nvertebræ may be regarded as exceptions, in which ossification took\r\nplace in a structure essentially cartilaginous.\r\n\r\n[532] Professor Owen states that a similar condition of the spinal\r\ncolumn obtains in the fossil Microdonts.--_Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1846.\r\n\r\nThe fishes found in the copper-schists of the Zechstein, at Mansfeld in\r\nSaxony, are generally impregnated with copper pyrites, and their scales\r\nare as brilliant as burnished gold. These ichthyolites are almost\r\nalways in contorted and twisted positions; which appearance M. Agassiz\r\nattributes to contraction of the muscular tissues after death, during\r\nthe progress of decomposition, and before the fishes sank down and\r\nbecame imbedded in the mud. (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. ii. p. 70.)\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the genus Palæoniscus are often found in the shales and\r\nmarls of the Permian and Carboniferous systems of England and Scotland.\r\nAt East Thickley, in the county of Durham, numerous specimens have\r\nbeen found.[533] The lower Carboniferous strata at Burdie-house, a\r\nlocality we have before mentioned, have yielded several species of\r\nPalæoniscus, associated with teeth and other remains of large sauroid\r\nfishes.[534] On the continent also they prevail in deposits of the same\r\nepoch; Eisleben and Mansfeld, iii Saxony, are well-known localities.\r\nIn North America they have been discovered in strata of probably the\r\nsame age.[535] In fine, the genera Amblypterus and Palæoniscus may\r\nbe regarded as characteristic \"medals\" of the geological epoch which\r\nintervened between the Devonian and Triassic formations.\r\n\r\n[533] See Professor Sedgwick on the Magnesian Limestone. Geol. Trans.\r\n2d ser. vol. iii.; and Prof. King’s Monograph on the Permian Fossils,\r\npublished by the Palæontographical Society.\r\n\r\n[534] Dr. Hibbert’s Memoir on the Fossils of Burdie-house.\r\n\r\n[535] Geology of Massachusetts, by Professor E. Hitchcock.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will next examine a few genera of the homocercal Lepidoids and\r\nPycnodonts, whose relics are chiefly distributed in the Lias, Oolite,\r\nPurbeck, and Wealden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 195. Outline of the Dapedius. _Lias._ (1/2 _nat.\r\nsize_).]\r\n\r\nDapedius. _Lign. 195._--At Lyme Regis, and other productive localities\r\nof the fossils of the Lias, large masses of angular enamelled scales,\r\nand occasionally entire specimens of the fishes to which they\r\nbelonged, have for many years been collected. Sir H. De la Beche first\r\nscientifically investigated the structure of these Ichthyolites, and\r\npointed out their characters and relations. The Dapedius (of which\r\na restored figure is given in _Lign. 195_) is a flat, laterally\r\ncompressed fish, with a rounded head, and fins of moderate size. The\r\nbody rapidly contracts towards the root of the tail, the fin of which\r\nis large and symmetrically lobed. The mouth is furnished with several\r\nrows of small conical teeth, which are crenated at their summits,\r\nand has brush-teeth on the palatine bones; the jaws are short. The\r\nscales are rhomboidal, highly polished, and united laterally by short\r\nprocesses; as in many other ganoid fishes. It belongs to the Lepidoids.\r\n\r\nThe Tetragonolepis is a Liassic fish, very similar in shape to the\r\nDapedius. It was formerly grouped with the _Lepidoidei_, but Sir P.\r\nEgerton has lately discovered that it essentially differs from those\r\nfishes in the character of its scales and teeth, and that it belongs to\r\nthe Pycnodonts.\r\n\r\nLepidotus.[536] _Lign. 186, 196, 197._--Scales of a dark-brown, almost\r\nblack colour, with a glossy enamelled surface, and of a rhomboidal\r\nor lozenge form, and teeth equally dark and glossy, of an obtuse\r\nhemispherical figure, are very common in the Wealden strata of the\r\nsouth-east of England and in the Isle of Purbeck. They are called by\r\nthe quarry-men _fishes' scales_ and _eyes_. The collectors of the\r\nlast century used to term the obtuse circular teeth of this and the\r\nrelated genera _Bufonites_, from a supposition that they were formed\r\nin the heads of toads. These relics belong to an extinct genus named\r\n_Lepidotus_, which contains numerous species, that are distributed in\r\nthe Oolite, Purbeck, and Wealden formations. These fishes resembled the\r\nCarps in their general form, but they have no anatomical relations to\r\nthat family. The body is covered with large rhomboidal scales, which\r\nare protected on the external surface by a thick plate of enamel (Lign\r\n196, _fig._ 3). The lateral line, which is slightly arched, passes\r\ndirect from the operculum to the middle of the insertion of the caudal\r\nfin. The head, and even the face, are cased with osseous and enamelled\r\nplates. The bones of the surface of the skull are very large, and are\r\nconnected by sinuous sutures. The jaws are short and rounded, and\r\nfurnished with a row of obtuse, conical, circular teeth (see _Lign.\r\n197_), and several rows of sessile teeth, more or less contracted at\r\nthe base, which forms a very short pedicle that is anchylosed to the\r\nbone. The fossil Lepidoti are found, for the most part, in fluviatile\r\ndeposits, as in the Purbeck and Wealden strata; and it is probable they\r\ninhabited the rivers or sea-coasts, and not deep waters.\r\n\r\n[536] _Poiss.

For._ pl. v. and x.; considerable portions of connected scales\r\nhave since been found; also the head entire, and the fins more or less\r\nperfect. A specimen in my collection retained a mass of the scales near\r\nthe insertion of the tail, a foot wide; indicating the original to\r\nhave been twelve feet long, and its body three feet broad. The scales\r\nare distinguished from other species by the folds or grooves on their\r\nenamelled surface; and the teeth by the contracted base, or pedicle,\r\nwhich is a little narrower than the crown (_Lign. 197_, and _Pl. VI.\r\nfig. 10_). A species (_L. Fittoni_) closely related to the above is\r\nequally abundant in the Weald of Sussex; the scales are not striated,\r\nand the teeth have no pedicle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 197. Portion of the Jaw of Lepidotus. _Wealden._\r\n_Tilgate Forest._ (_Nat. size._)\r\n\r\nThis specimen shows three successional teeth beneath a row of teeth in\r\nuse.]\r\n\r\nThe intimate structure of the teeth of the Lepidotus is beautifully\r\npreserved, and may be easily examined in thin transverse and vertical\r\nsections, viewed by transmitted light: see _Pl. VI. fig. 10_. The\r\ndentine is composed of bundles of tubes, continued from the cells of\r\nthe osseous base, radiating in a vertical direction to the surface of\r\nthe tooth, as seen in _Pl. VI. fig. 10_, and giving off branches at an\r\nacute angle; but when more highly magnified, the finer branches are\r\nseen to be spread out and arched at their extremities, \"presenting the\r\nappearance of the stems of corn, beaten down by heavy rain.\"[537]\r\n\r\n[537] Odontography, p. 70. See the beautiful representation of this\r\nstructure, pl. xxxi.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal and pectoral fins of these fishes are very strong, and\r\nconsist of several bony rays. There is a double row of acuminated\r\nenamelled scales, arranged more or less obliquely, on the anterior\r\nmargin of the dorsal and anal fins, and on both margins of the caudal:\r\npart of the first ray of a dorsal fin, with scales, is represented\r\n_Lign. 196, fig. 5_.\r\n\r\nA small species of Lepidotus (_A. minor_) is common in the Purbeck\r\nlimestone, and specimens may often be procured from the quarries near\r\nSwanage;[538] it has also been found at Hildesheim, in Saxony, by M.\r\nRoemer. The detached scales abound in the limestones; and the splendid\r\nfossil reptile from Swanage, figured _Petrif. Lign. 38_, is sprinkled\r\nwith the scales and minute teeth of this fish.\r\n\r\n[538] Fine specimens of this fish are in the British Museum\r\n(_Petrifactions_, p. 429), and in the Museum at Dorchester.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the species of Lepidotus belong to the Lower Oolites\r\nand the Lias. The habits of the Lepidoti, as indicated by the form and\r\nstructure of the teeth, were those of fishes whose food consisted of\r\ncrustaceans, shelly mollusca, &c.; for the dental organs are peculiarly\r\nadapted for the crushing and grinding of such substances; and the teeth\r\nof the adult fishes are generally worn down by use.\r\n\r\nPycnodus. _Pl. I. fig. 3_; _Lign. 194, fig. 3._--The fishes of\r\nthe family of Pycnodonts, so named from the thickness of their teeth,\r\nhave an osseous skeleton, a flat body covered with rhomboidal scales,\r\nand flat or rounded teeth disposed in several rows on the palatine,\r\nvomerine, intermaxillary, and premandibular bones.[539] As in the\r\nLepidotus, these teeth are constructed for crushing, and have generally\r\na smooth, dense, convex or flattened crown, with a highly polished\r\nsurface. This genus belongs chiefly to the Oolite; it is found also\r\nin the Lias, Chalk, and Wealden. A perfect fish of the genus Pycnodus\r\n(_P. rhombus_), from the Jura limestone, at Torre d’Orlando, near\r\nCastellamare, is figured in the frontispiece of the first volume of\r\nthis work; and a vomerine bone, with teeth, from Tilgate Forest, in\r\n_Lign. 194, fig. 3_. In the last fossil there is a median row of\r\nflat,, elongated, transversely arched, smooth, glossy teeth, with a\r\ndouble alternate row of small sub-circular teeth on each side, attached\r\nto the bone, which is imbedded in Tilgate grit. Specimens of this kind,\r\nbelonging to one or more species of Pycnodus, occur in the Wealden\r\nof Sussex; they were among my earliest discoveries in Tilgate Forest\r\n(_Foss. Til. For._ pl. xvii. figs. 26, 27). Examples are met; with in\r\nwhich all the teeth are shed, and the bony plate of the vomer alone\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[539] The intermaxillary, palatine, and vomerine bones compose the\r\nvault or roof of the mouth; the vomer occupying the middle; the\r\nintermaxillary the front; and the palatine bones the sides; the\r\npremandibular bones belong to the lower border of the mouth.\r\n\r\nGyrodus. _Lign. 198._--In another genus of the Pycnodonts, termed\r\nGyrodus, the crowns of the teeth are deeply furrowed, the structure\r\nof the dentine is very dense, and the pulp-cavity large and simple.\r\nOne species occurs in the Speeton clay of Yorkshire, and another in\r\nthe Sussex weald; but the teeth are chiefly found in the Oolite and\r\nChalk. As in Pycnodus, the teeth are distributed in rows on the bones\r\ncomposing the roof, floor, and sides of the mouth.[540]\r\n\r\n[540] An extraordinarily perfect lower jaw of a Gyrodus is to be seen\r\nin the British Museum (_Foss. Brit. Mus._ p. 439).\r\n\r\nThese characters are beautifully displayed in the Russian specimen,\r\n_Lign. 198_. This interesting fossil was presented to me by the late\r\nStephen Cattley, jun. Esq., who collected it in 1839, in a valley near\r\nRjeff, a village on the banks of the Volga. Mr. Cattley informed me\r\n\"that many fossils are found in that and the neighbouring valleys;\r\nand the locality is frequented by Russian geologists when the season\r\npermits, which is but seldom, owing to the long duration of the snow,\r\nand the heavy rains which accompany the thaw.\" This specimen consists\r\nof the vomerine bone, which is of a coarse texture, and five rows of\r\nteeth; the median row consists of very large elliptical teeth; those\r\nof the lateral rows are much smaller and arranged alternately. The\r\npeculiar structure of the teeth of this genus[541] is finely displayed\r\nin this fossil. The ample, deep, and simple pulp-cavity is seen in\r\nseveral teeth, where the crown of dentine has been worn off, filled\r\nwith a pure white calcareous spar; one of these cavities is marked a.\r\nThe dentine is extremely dense, consisting of very minute calcigerous\r\ntubes, and passes into an external layer of enamel.\r\n\r\n[541] Odontography, p. 72.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 198. Gyrodus Murchisoni[542] (G. A. M.) _Oolite?_\r\n_Russia._\r\n\r\n(_Collected by the late Stephen Cattley, jun.

I. Murchison, in commemoration of those extended\r\nand successful geological researches in the Russian empire, which have\r\nconferred additional honour on his distinguished name.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the genus _Gyrodus_ have the body large, flat, and\r\nelevated; the dorsal and anal fins are very long; and the tail is\r\nforked, with equal elongated lobes. The scales are laterally connected\r\nby strong processes, as in Lepidotus.\r\n\r\nOther genera related to the foregoing occur in the Oolite; as for\r\nexample, Microdon, thus named from the smallness of its very numerous\r\nflat angular teeth, arranged in many rows; Placodus, in which the teeth\r\nare few, flat, and of great size;[543] and Platysomus (_flat-body_),\r\nwith orbicular, clavate, teeth.\r\n\r\n[543] Odontography, pl. xliii. _fig._ 1, and pl. xxx. _fig._ 2.\r\n\r\nIn these fishes, also, the dental organs are well adapted for the\r\ncomminution of shell-fish, and other hard bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCephalaspides of the Devonian System.--The remains of the three genera\r\nof Ganoid fishes that we have now to notice are of a very remarkable\r\ncharacter, and are found exclusively in the Devonian or Old Red system;\r\nmost frequently in Scotland, but also in other parts of the British\r\nIsles, and in Europe and America. These fishes agree in one general\r\ncharacter, that of having extensive osseous plates, or scutcheons;\r\ntheir general aspect will be understood by reference to _Lign. 199,\r\n200, 201_. There are no vestiges of the bodies of the vertebræ, which,\r\ntherefore, were probably cartilaginous. These fishes constitute a\r\ndistinct family with the name _Cephalaspides_, from the character of\r\nthe first genus we propose to describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 199. Cephalaspis Lyellii. (1/4 _nat. size_.)\r\n\r\n_Devonian._ _Forfarshire._\r\n\r\nCrushed specimen; seen from above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 200. Cephalaspis Lyellii. (1/4 _nat. size_.)\r\n\r\n_Devonian._ _Glammis, Forfarshire._\r\n\r\nLateral view, showing the produced dorsal lobe of the tail.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCephalaspis Lyellii. _Lign. 199, 200._--The most striking feature in\r\nthe Ichthyolites of this genus is the enormous scutcheon, or buckler,\r\nwhich forms the head, and is prolonged posteriorly into two lateral\r\nhorns or points; this part so closely resembles the cephalic shield of\r\ncertain trilobites (see _Lign. 175_), that the first found specimens\r\nwere supposed to be the remains of unknown crustaceans. The name\r\n_Cephalaspis_ (_buckler-head_) is derived from this character. This\r\nremarkable appearance is occasioned by the intimate anchylosis of\r\nall the bones of the cranium. The body of these fishes is relatively\r\nsmaller than the head; it has one dorsal fin, and terminates in a\r\ntapering tail, supporting a fin. There are two small eyes, placed\r\ntowards the middle of the head. The body is covered with rhomboidal\r\nscales; and the head with discoidal scales, which are highly ornamented\r\nwith radiated markings[544] (_Ly._ p. 344, _fig._ 396). There are four\r\nspecies of Cephalaspis at present known.\r\n\r\n[544] Poiss. Foss. tom. ii. p. 135.\r\n\r\nThe other genera are equally unlike any recent types of the class of\r\nfishes. No perfect examples have been found, and some parts of their\r\nstructure are still unknown; the annexed figures, _Lign. 201_, have\r\nbeen drawn by Mr. Dinkel (the eminent artist employed by M. Agassiz),\r\nwith scrupulous accuracy, no part being introduced which is not clearly\r\ndemonstrated in some one specimen; and the form of the scutcheons is\r\nmade out very distinctly, to aid the collector in discriminating the\r\ndetached plates, which are the most common relics of these singular\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nPterichthys cornutus.[545] _Lign. 201, fig.1._--This fish is\r\ndistinguished by its two wing-like lateral appendages; whence the name\r\nof the genus (_winged-fish_). These processes, like the spines on the\r\ngill-covers of the common Bullhead (_Cottus gobio_), are weapons of\r\ndefence. In some specimens they are extended at right angles to the\r\nbody (_Ly._ p. 345, _fig._ 400).\r\n\r\n[545] The first fish of this genus was discovered by Mr. Hugh Miller,\r\nin whose charming little work, \"The Old Red Sandstone; or, New Walks\r\nin an Old Field,\" will be found a very graphic description of the Old\r\nRed fishes; I know not a more fascinating volume on any branch of\r\nBritish geology. Consult also Sir P. Egerton’s elaborate paper on the\r\n_Pterichthys_ in the Geol. Journal, vol. iv. p. 302.\r\n\r\nThe head and anterior part of the body are covered with large angular\r\ntuberculated scutcheons. The under surface of the body is flat and\r\nprotected by five plates, a quadrangular plate occupying the centre.\r\nThe upper part of the body is convex; the form and disposition of the\r\ndorsal scutcheons are shown in _Lign. 201, fig.1_. There are two\r\neyes, which are placed in front of the lateral spines: see _fig. 1._\r\nThe tail is of an angular form, and as long as the body; it is\r\ncovered with scales, and considered by M. Agassiz to have been the only\r\ninstrument of locomotion. The British species of this genus, of which\r\nten are known, are all very small, varying in length from one to ten\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 201. Fossil Fishes of the Devonian System.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Mr. Joseph Dinkel._)\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Pterichthys cornutus, seen from above.\r\n       2.--Coccosteus oblongus.\r\n\r\nThese figures are restored with great care, from the best preserved\r\nspecimens hitherto discovered.]\r\n\r\nCoccosteus oblongus. _Lign. 201, fig. 2._--The fishes of this\r\ngenus, as may be seen by the lignograph, very much resemble those\r\nof Pterichthys; in both the osseous scutcheons of the body are very\r\nsimilarly disposed. In _Coccosteus_, the head[546] is somewhat rounded;\r\nslight rounded notches on the edge of the buckler indicate the place of\r\nthe eyes on the sides of the head. There is no indication of lateral\r\nspines. The tail is very long, covered with scales, and supports a fin.\r\nThe plates of the body are tuberculated, as in Pterichthys. There are\r\nsix or eight teeth on each half of the lower jaw (and probably as many\r\non the upper), with a curious group of teeth situated on its symphisis.\r\nThe teeth are chiefly composed of bone, passing into dentine at their\r\nsurface.[547]\r\n\r\n[546] This is of course only the cranial buckler of the animal, for,\r\nas Mr. Hugh Miller observes, \"of the true internal skull there\r\nremains not a vestige. Like that of the Sturgeon, it must have been a\r\nperishable cartilaginous box.\"--_Miller’s Foot-prints_, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[547] Miller, Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1850. Transact. Sect. p. 92. In the\r\nAnnals of Natural History for November, 1848, Professor M‘Coy has given\r\na corrected outline of the carapace, or bony cephalo-thoracic casing,\r\nof the Coccosteus. See also Miller’s Foot-prints, _fig._ 11.\r\n\r\nThese fishes are from a few inches to two feet in length; six species\r\nhave been discovered; and their remains are the most abundant of the\r\nIchthyolites of the Old Red. Patches of detached scales, and isolated\r\nosseous plates, are very frequent in the sandy cornstones, and the\r\nsubcrystalline masses of limestone. These fragments are usually of a\r\nbrilliant blue or purple colour; and, strongly contrasting with the\r\ndull red tint of the surrounding rock, are easily recognised. The\r\ncolour is supposed to be due to the presence of phosphate of iron,\r\nwhich has communicated a similar tint to the Ichthyolites of the\r\nCaithness Schist.[548]\r\n\r\n[548] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 588; see also a detailed description of\r\nthe Cephalaspis, Holoptychius, and other Devonian Ichthyolites, by M.\r\nAgassiz, ibid. p. 589-601.\r\n\r\nFossil Sauroid Fishes. (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. ii.)--The family of Ganoid,\r\nfishes termed _Sauroid_, or lizard-like, by M. Agassiz, are so named\r\nin consequence of certain peculiarities in their organization which\r\nare found in no other animals of this class, but exist in reptiles.\r\nThere are but two living genera; namely, the _Lepidosteus_, of which\r\nthere are many species that inhabit the rivers of America; and the\r\n_Polypterus_, that contains two species, one inhabiting the Nile, and\r\nthe other the rivers of Senegal. In these fishes the bones of the\r\nskull are closely connected by sutures; the teeth are large, conical,\r\nand longitudinally striated, as in the crocodile, plesiosaurus, &c.;\r\nthe spinous processes are united to the bodies of the vertebræ by\r\nsuture, as in most reptiles; and the ribs are articulated to the\r\nextremities of the transverse processes; the skeleton is osseous. Even\r\nin the soft parts many analogies to reptilian structure are seen;\r\nthus the Lepidosteus has a glottis, as in the _Siren_; and a cellular\r\nair-bladder, with a tracheal vessel, resembling the lungs of an\r\nOphidian (_serpent_). These fishes are the only living representatives\r\nof those voracious tribes of the most ancient marine fauna, whose\r\nremains abound in the Secondary formations. Their relics have often\r\nbeen mistaken for those of reptiles; particularly the teeth, which\r\nfrom their large size, conical figure, enamelled and striated surface,\r\nand internal cavity, were generally supposed to belong to crocodiles.\r\nThe scales are flat, rhomboidal, and parallel to the body. The recent\r\n_Lepidosteus osseus_, of North America, affords a good illustration\r\nof the fossil genera; a reduced figure of this fish, from _Poiss.\r\nFoss._, will be found in _Bd._ pl. xxvii^_a_.; and teeth of some fossil\r\nSauroids are represented _Bd._ pl. xxvii.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the Sauroids consist of two kinds; namely, large pointed\r\nstriated cones, and numerous small brush-teeth. The intricate structure\r\nof the conical teeth of the _Stony-gar_, or Lepidosteus, is very\r\nremarkable, and presents some analogy to that observable in the dental\r\norgans of the Labyrinthodon, an extinct genus of reptiles, of which\r\nwe shall treat in a subsequent chapter. The tooth consists of a large\r\nconical pulp-cavity, surrounded by a mass of dentine, which is plicated\r\nlongitudinally, its folds giving to the pulp-cavity an appearance of\r\nbeing divided into parallel longitudinal branches; resembling, in\r\nthis respect, the base of the tooth of Ichthyosaurus, as shown in a\r\ntransverse section, _Pl. VI. fig 9_. If we imagine these folds to be\r\nmultiplied, and to have more inflections, and the pulp-cavity to be\r\nreduced in its proportions, we shall have the elegant organization\r\nof the teeth of the _Labyrinthodonts_ (see _Pl. VI. fig. 3^b_). The\r\ndentine is composed of very minute calcigerous tubes, which pass off at\r\nright angles from the pulp-cavity to the periphery; and it is covered\r\nby a layer of cement, or coarser dentine, which is encased in a coat\r\nof enamel, forming the external investment of the tooth.[549] The long\r\nconical teeth are implanted in _alveoli_ or sockets, to the walls of\r\nwhich they are anchylosed at their base.\r\n\r\n[549] These remarks are based on M. Agassiz’s description and my own\r\nobservations. An interesting paper, \"On the Microscopic Structure of\r\nthe Teeth of the _Lepidostei_, and their analogy with those of the\r\n_Labyrinthodonts_, with a plate,\" by _Dr. Jeffries Wyman_, will be\r\nfound in Amer. Journ. of Science, October, 1843, p. 359.\r\n\r\nLepidostei.--This family, having the above described recent\r\n_Lepidosteus_ for its type, comprises several genera, and is\r\nrepresented in all the formations from the Tertiary to the\r\nCoal-measures inclusive. The _Lepidosteus_ itself has left its remains\r\nin the Eocene tertiary of England. The Lepidotus (before described,\r\np. 604,) ranges from the Chalk to the Lias; the _Pholidophorus_ and\r\n_Dapedius_ (p. 603) abound in the Lias; the latter being found also\r\nin the Wealden, and the former in the Oolite and Purbeck; and the\r\n_Palæoniscus_ (see p. 601) is a well-known Permian and Carboniferous\r\nform.\r\n\r\nSauroidei.--The remains of the Sauroids proper occur in the Chalk,\r\nPurbeck, Oolite, Lias, Permian, and Carboniferous rocks. The great\r\nstrength and size of some of these teeth prove that the seas of\r\nthose remote periods were inhabited by voracious fishes of enormous\r\nmagnitude. See _Petrif._ pp. 432, _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe teeth and jaw of a gigantic sauroid (_Megalichthys_), from the\r\nCarboniferous strata at Burdie-house, are figured _Bd._ pl. xxvii.; the\r\nsections of the teeth shown in figs. 13, 14, of that plate, illustrate\r\nthe size of the pulp-cavity and the thickness of the layer of dentine.\r\nThese remains were associated with the plants and crustaceans\r\npreviously described; an assemblage of fossils indicating a lacustrine\r\nor estuary formation. Similar teeth have been found in the cannel-coal\r\nof Fifeshire.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Lias of Ilminster, Somerset, the nodular calcareous rock\r\nis rich with the remains of the _Pachycormus_, many fine specimens of\r\nwhich Mr. C. Moore, of that town, has successfully worked out from\r\ntheir stony encasement, exhibiting the gaping, contorted fish, as it\r\ndied in the convulsive throes of suffocation in the muddy sea. The\r\nlittle sauroid _Leptolepis_, of the Lias and the Purbeck, is also\r\nabundant in the above mentioned locality.\r\n\r\nIn the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, and in the Purbeck strata,\r\nOxford Clay, and Lias of England, occur specimens of a sauroid fish\r\nremarkable for the extreme shortness of the lower jaw, and the\r\nprolongation of the upper into a beak; it is named _Aspidorhynchus_ by\r\nAgassiz. The figure of this fossil fish is contrasted on pl. xxvii^_a_.\r\n_Bd._ with that of its recent ally, the _Lepidosteus_.\r\n\r\nIn the Shanklin sand and in the Galt of Kent and Sussex, large,\r\nconical, striated teeth belonging to sauroid fishes are occasionally\r\nfound. They invariably occur detached, and no portion of the jaws has\r\nbeen observed. In the Chalk of Sussex several fine sauroid fishes have\r\nbeen discovered; such as the _Lophiostomus_,[550] _Belonostomus_,[551]\r\nand _Caturus_; the last two of which are found in the Oolite and Lias\r\nalso. These have been described and figured in the late Mr. Dixon’s\r\n\"Geology and Fossils of Sussex.\"\r\n\r\n[550] _Geol. Surv._ Dec. 6. pl. x. xi.\r\n\r\n[551] _Petrif._ p. 431.\r\n\r\nThe Sauroidei-dipterini[552] are found almost exclusively in the\r\nDevonian formation. _Osteolepis_, _Diplopterus_, and _Dipterus_ are\r\ncharacteristic members of this family. Interesting descriptions and\r\ninstructive figures of the structure of these genera are given in\r\nMr. Hugh Miller’s late work, \"Foot-prints of the Creator, or the\r\nAsterolepis of Stromness,\" at pp. 50 to 61.\r\n\r\n[552] The characters of the scales of this and the next family, as well\r\nas of the Acanthodei, are succinctly given in Miller’s Foot-prints of\r\nthe Creator, pp. 30, _et seq._\r\n\r\nCœlacanthi.--This is a numerous family of sauroid fishes, that have\r\nderived their name, _hollow-spine_, from the central cavity in the\r\nfin-rays, which, however, may have had originally cartilaginous\r\ncores. They are found from the Devonian to the Cretaceous series. In\r\nthe former, one of the most remarkable is the genus _Holoptychius_,\r\ndistinguished by the peculiar structure of the scales; the enamelled\r\nsurface of which is covered by undulated furrows. The whole body is\r\ncovered by thick enamelled scales of this kind. A splendid specimen,\r\ntwenty-eight inches long, and twelve wide, is figured _Murch. Sil.\r\nSyst._ pl. ii.^{_bis._} Scales have been found exceeding three inches\r\nin length, by two and a half in width; which must have belonged to a\r\nfish of great magnitude. _Ly._ fig. 395.\r\n\r\nIn the Old Red Sandstone of Elgin, at a quarry at Scat-craig, some\r\npeculiar teeth occur, which possess a very remarkable structure, and\r\nhave been referred to a genus of sauroid fishes, which, from the\r\ndendritical or arborescent disposition of the calcigerous tubes,\r\nProf. Owen has named _Dendrodus_. These teeth are of a conical form,\r\nslightly curved, and solid throughout. On the external surface they\r\nare finely striated longitudinally, and have two opposite vertical\r\nridges; the base is rough, and its margin rounded, as if for attachment\r\nto a shallow socket. The largest specimen is one and a half inch in\r\nlength. In thin sections, viewed microscopically by transmitted light,\r\nthere is a central pulp-cavity, of small size; the medullary canals\r\npass into a few short ramifications, like the branches of a shrub, and\r\nthese are distributed into irregular dilatations, simulating leaves,\r\nwhich resolve themselves into radiating bundles of calcigerous tubes; a\r\nportion of a transverse section[553] is shown _Pl.

Miller’s charming work just referred to we have a full\r\nand clear account of the singular fossil fish the Asterolepis.\r\nRemains of this gigantic Ganoid were first found in Russia.[554]\r\nIts name is derived from the stellate markings on the dermal plates\r\nof the head, which are of great size, and form a strong expanded\r\nbuckler, the orbits of the eyes being situated near the anterior\r\nborder. (See Miller’s _Asterolepis_, pp. 74, _et seq._ figs. 27-29.)\r\n_Lign. 202_ shows a part of the lower jaw of this fish, seen on the\r\ninside. Along the upper margin are seen a \"thickly set row of small\r\nbroadly-based teeth,\"--these are ordinary _fish_-teeth; and behind this\r\nedge-row of small teeth, _b_, there occur \"a thinly set row of huge\r\n_reptile_-teeth, based on an interior platform of bone, which formed\r\nthe top of the cartilage enclosing box composing the jaw.\" (Miller.)\r\nThese large teeth, _a a_, are longitudinally striated, and generally\r\nbear two sharp lateral cutting edges.[555]\r\n\r\n[554] Casts of the fossil bones from Russia are in the British Museum;\r\n_Petrif._ p. 435.\r\n\r\n[555] The microscopic structure of both kinds of teeth is elegantly\r\nfigured in Mr. Miller’s work, pp. 81, 82.\r\n\r\nMacropoma Mantelli. _Wond._ p. 348. (_Foss. South D._ tab. xxxvii.\r\nxxxviii.; _Petrif._ p. 436, _Lign._ 89.)--This Cœlacanth fish is\r\nfrom one to two feet in length, of an elongated fusiform shape, with\r\na large head and two dorsal fins; the anterior fin is imbedded, and\r\nhas seven or eight strong spinous rays, the first two of which have\r\nnumerous spines. The opercula are very long and large (hence its\r\nname); the scales[556] are garnished with adpressed spines, disposed\r\nin semicircular rows (see _Lign. 185, fig. 2_). The teeth are small,\r\nconical, and numerous.\r\n\r\n[556] See Prof. Williamson’s Memoir, Philos. Trans. 1849, p. 435; pl.\r\nxliii. figs. 27, 28.\r\n\r\nSeveral specimens of this fish are almost perfect. The bones of the\r\ncranium, the jaws, teeth, opercula, branchial rays, palatine arches,\r\nthe surface of the body covered with scales, all the fins, the pelvic\r\nbones, the vertebræ and their apophyses, all remain.\r\n\r\nIn one example, the vomer, covered with minute teeth, is exposed.\r\nBut the most extraordinary fact relating to these Ichthyolites, is\r\nthe preservation, in every specimen, of the air-bladder;[557] even\r\nits membranes remain, and separate in flakes; and the ramification\r\nof the minute vessels is visible under a high magnifying power. In\r\nsome instances this bladder is displaced and much distended; but in\r\ngeneral it occupies its natural position, and retains its elongated,\r\nsub-cylindrical form, with a few annular constrictions or folds.\r\n\r\n[557] See Williamson, _op. cit._ pp. 462-165, and figs. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COPROLITES. COLOLITES.]\r\n\r\nCoprolites. _Lign. 139, figs. 1, 2._--In more than one example\r\nthe solid earthy residue of digestion, in small lumps or pellets,\r\nof a conical form and spirally convoluted, lies in the abdomen of\r\nthese fossil fishes. Fossil excrementitious substances of this kind\r\nare termed _Coprolites_ (_Bd._ p. 198, pl. xv.); they occur in many\r\ndeposits, and belong not only to fishes, but to large reptiles and\r\nother animals. _Lign. 139_, p. 432, _fig. 1_, represents the coprolite\r\nof a _Macropoma_; and _fig. 2_, that of a species of _Shark_, from\r\nHamsey. The convoluted appearance of these bodies arises from the\r\npeculiar organization of the intestinal canal of the original fishes,\r\nin which, as in the recent Dog-fish, a portion of the intestine was\r\nspirally twisted, the tube forming several gyrations; and the passage\r\nof the calcareous substance through this constricted canal gave rise\r\nto the structure observable in the coprolites. In the Macropoma the\r\ngyrations appear to have been few; seldom more than five or six\r\nturns being apparent. In the fossil Sharks the convolutions are more\r\nnumerous, ten or twelve occurring in the length of an inch. In many\r\nof the coprolites, the impression of the mucous or lining membrane of\r\nthe intestinal canal may be detected. Some of the coprolites of the\r\nMacropoma are not convoluted; probably from having occupied the upper\r\npart of the digestive tube, and therefore not having been moulded in\r\nthe spiral part. (See _Geol. S. E._ p. 145. _Foss. South D._ tab. ix.)\r\nMinute scales and bones of fishes are occasionally imbedded in the\r\nsubstance of the coprolites, affording evidence of the carnivorous\r\nhabits of the Macropoma.\r\n\r\nCololites. _Bd._ pl. xv^_a_--It will be convenient to notice in this\r\nplace those curious fossils which occur in detached masses in the\r\nlimestone of Solenhofen, and used to be known to collectors by the\r\nterm _lumbricaria_, from the supposition that they were petrified\r\nearth-worms. An excellent representation of a fine specimen is given\r\nby Dr. Buckland in the plate referred to above. These convoluted\r\nbodies M. Agassiz, with his wonted sagacity, has ascertained to be\r\nthe intestines of fishes; and has therefore named them _Cololites_.\r\nAlthough generally found isolated, specimens occur in which they are\r\nimbedded, like the coprolites of the Macropoma, in the abdominal\r\nregion of fishes. The frequent occurrence of the _Cololites_ apart\r\nfrom the body, is explained by the usual process of decomposition in\r\nfishes. M. Agassiz remarks that dead fish always float on the surface\r\nof the water with the belly uppermost, until the abdomen bursts from\r\ndistention. The small intestines are then expelled by the evolved gases\r\nthrough the aperture, and soon become detached from the body. I have\r\nobserved indistinct traces of similar remains in the beds of chalk in\r\nwhich fossil fishes most prevail. Dr. Buckland mentions the discovery,\r\nby Lord Greenock, of a mass of petrified intestines distended with\r\ncoprolite, and surrounded by the scales of a fish, in a block of\r\ncoal-shale from the neighbourhood of Edinburgh (_Bd._ p. 199).\r\n\r\n\r\nDercetis elongatus. _Wond._ p. 349.--Before proceeding to the\r\ninvestigation of examples of the next order, I will describe a highly\r\ninteresting Ichthyolite, which in a mutilated state is extremely\r\ncommon in some of the chalk strata of the South-east of England; it is\r\nnoticed in _Foss. South D._ p. 232. This fish is placed by M. Agassiz\r\nin his family of ganoidians, termed _Scleroderms_; and he mentions\r\nthat another species has been found in the chalk of Westphalia. The\r\n_Dercetis_ has a very elongated body, with a short head terminating in\r\na pointed beak; the upper jaw is a little longer than the lower, and\r\nboth jaws are armed with long, conical, elevated teeth, and several\r\nrows of very small ones. On each side of the fish there are three rows\r\nof osseous scutcheons like those of the Sturgeon (see _Wond._ p. 349);\r\nthe body was also covered with numerous small scales. From the form\r\nof the body somewhat resembling that of the eel, being very long, and\r\nsub-cylindrical in uncompressed examples, the specimens are generally\r\ncalled \"_petrified eels_\" by the quarry-men. The examples usually found\r\nconsist of the elongated body, more or less compressed, and irregularly\r\ncovered with patches of scales confusedly intermingled; among which\r\ntraces of the scutcheons may sometimes be distinguished. These\r\nspecimens occasionally exceed two feet in length, by one or two inches\r\nin breadth; with neither extremity perfect, and without any vestige\r\nof the fins.[558] The example figured _Wond._ _Lign. 74_, is the only\r\ninstance in which I have seen the cranium perfect. The scutcheons in\r\nthe Westphalian species have a prominent longitudinal ridge or keel,\r\nand their surface finely granulated; they are so large that the whole\r\nbody of the fish is covered with them.\r\n\r\n[558] See _Foss. South D._ pl. xl. _fig._ 2, and pl. xxxiv. figs. 10\r\nand 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CTENOID FISHES.]\r\n\r\nFossil Ctenoid Fishes (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. iv.).--The fishes of this\r\norder have imbricated laminated scales, the posterior margins of\r\nwhich are round and finely pectinated; _i. e._ divided into little\r\nteeth, like a comb. These scales are nearly circular, but more or less\r\nelongated; and, as the laminæ of which they are composed successively\r\ndiminish from the lowermost to the uppermost, the pectinated margin of\r\neach being apparent, the surface is very scabrous; the front edge is\r\nsinuous. The common Perch is the type of the Ctenoidians. The teeth of\r\nthese fishes are invariably small, and either villous or brush-like.\r\n\r\nFrom the numerous fossil genera I select, in illustration of the\r\ncharacters of this order, the _Beryx_; of which four species occur\r\nin the English Chalk, and three others in the Chalk of Bohemia and\r\nWestphalia. Of this genus, which is closely related to the Perch\r\n(_Perca_), two living species inhabit the seas of Australia. The bones\r\nof the skull have dentated crests; the dorsal fin has spinous rays in\r\nfront, which are united to the soft rays; the margin of the caudal fin\r\nhas little spinous rays.\r\n\r\nThe Beryx is one of the most ancient representatives of the Perch\r\ntribe, and of the Ctenoid order.\r\n\r\nBeryx Lewesiensis.[559] _Wond._ p. 351; _Petrif._ _Lign. 90._--This\r\nis one of the most common of the Ichthyolites of the Chalk of the\r\nSouth-east of England; it is called \"_Johnny Dory_\" by the quarry-men;\r\nthe specimens are from six to twelve inches long. It occurs also in the\r\nChalk of Westphalia. The outline of the perfect form of this species,\r\n_Wond._ p. 351, by Mr. Dinkel, conveys an accurate idea of its external\r\ncharacters. It has one dorsal fin, with several spinous rays in front\r\nof the soft ray. The head is very large, and the opercular pieces are\r\nornamented with sculptured rays; the margins of the jaws are covered\r\nwith a broad band of brush-teeth. The orbit is large, and often\r\ncontains the capsule (_sclerotica_) of the eye. The rays of the gills\r\nare short and thick, five are preserved in some examples. The scales\r\nare very large; about twenty-five in the median row; their posterior\r\nmargins have several concentric rows of spines (see _Lign. 185, fig.\r\n3_, p. 567). The lateral line is often distinctly apparent, in the form\r\nof a tube, contracted behind and expanded in the centre of the scale.\r\nThe vertebral column is composed of large short vertebræ, with very\r\nlong apophyses; the ribs are slight.\r\n\r\n[559] The fossil discovered by me, and figured in _Foss. South D._ tab.\r\nxxxvi. was the first perfect fish obtained from the Chalk. This fish\r\nwas first described by me, _Foss. South D._ tab. xxxv. xxxvi. as Zeus\r\n_Lewesiensis_; M. Agassiz has very properly referred it to the genus\r\n_Beryx_; but he has also substituted another specific name; which is\r\nwholly unwarrantable, for that first imposed ought to be retained; see\r\np. 518, note.\r\n\r\nBeryx superbus.--This is a larger species, sometimes thirteen inches\r\nlong, with very large and broad scales. It has been found in the lower\r\nchalk at Lewes. See Dixon’s _Foss. Sussex_, tab. xxxvi. _fig._ 5.\r\n\r\nBeryx radians. _Wond._ p. 350.--This species is smaller, and relatively\r\nlonger, than _B. Lewesiensis_; it generally occurs in the Chalk-marl,\r\nand is invariably of a very dark colour, the scales having a polished\r\nor glossy aspect. The scales are small, with a simple row of diverging\r\nspines on the posterior edge. The scales of the lateral line are\r\npeculiar; the mucous canal is not formed of a series of simple tubular\r\ncylinders, as in _B. Lewesiensis_, but is divided into several\r\nbranches, as may be seen with a lens of moderate power. There are more\r\nthan thirty scales in the length of the lateral line.\r\n\r\nBeryx microcephalus (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. iv. tab. iv^_c_.; and Dixon,\r\n_Foss. Sussex_, tab. xxiv. _fig._ 3).--This fish is distinguished by\r\nits slender form, and the extreme smallness of the head, as the name\r\nimplies. The scales have one row of very thick spines on the posterior\r\nmargin; they are more elevated, and shorter than in _B. radians_;\r\nthose of the lateral line are pierced by an elongated conical tube,\r\nand are not ramified as in the last species. This ichthyolite, like\r\nthe _B. radians_, occurs in the Chalk-marl, and in a similar state of\r\nmineralization.\r\n\r\nSmerdis minutus. _Lign. 203._--A pretty ctenoidian fish, from one to\r\nthree inches long, about the dimensions of a perch a year old, is very\r\ncommon in the marls of Aix in Provence, _Wond._ p. 260; and many are\r\noften found grouped together in every variety of position. This species\r\nis characterised by the elevated anterior rays of the dorsal, and the\r\nwide and very forked caudal fin.\r\n\r\nSeveral ctenoidian and cycloidian fishes have been found in the north\r\nof the Brazils, by Mr. Gardiner, in strata probably of the Cretaceous\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nFossil Cycloid Fishes. (_Poiss. Foss._ tom. v.)--This order comprises\r\nthe fishes possessing scales of a cycloid, or circular, form, with\r\nsmooth margins, and composed of plates of horn or bone, without\r\nenamel. It contains numerous families, including the _Scaroids_, or\r\nParrot-fishes, and the _Scomberoids_, or Mackerel tribe, which are\r\nAcanthopterygians, the _Lucioids_, or Pikes, _Clupeoids_, or Herrings,\r\n_Salmonoids_, or Salmon tribe, and the _Cyprinoids_, or Carps, which\r\nare Malacopterygians, as well as other families. The fossil remains of\r\nthis order are exceedingly numerous, particularly in the Tertiary and\r\nupper Secondary deposits. A genus of _Salmonidæ_, discovered in the\r\nWhite Chalk of Sussex, will serve to exemplify the characters of the\r\nfossil cycloidian fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 203. Smerdis minutus. _Eocene._ (_nat. size_.)\r\n\r\n_Aix in Provence._]\r\n\r\nOsmeroides. _Plate II._ and _Wond._ p. 344, 347.--Two species of\r\nthis genus occur in the Chalk, near Lewes; and principally, if not\r\nexclusively, in the Lower Chalk, without flints. They are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful Ichthyolites, and are almost invariably found with the body\r\nbut little compressed; the fish, in many examples, is as round and\r\nperfect as when living. The entire cranium, the opercula and branchial\r\nrays, and all the fins are preserved in some examples. These fishes\r\nbelong to the Salmon family,[560] and are nearly related to the Smelt\r\n(_Osmerus_); whence the name of the genus. There are two species,\r\neasily distinguishable. The first (_O. Mantelli_, _Pl. II._) has a\r\nshort, sub-cylindrical body, and seldom exceeds eight or nine inches in\r\nlength; the other (_O. Lewesiensis_) has an elongated and elliptical\r\nbody, and sometimes attains a length of fourteen inches. The dorsal fin\r\ntoo in this species has more rays than in the other. The fossil figured\r\nin _Pl. II_. is a very remarkable specimen of the first species. It\r\nis nine inches in length; and the chalk has been cleared away, so as\r\nto expose the entire fish, six inches in relief above the surface of\r\nthe block, _Petrif._ _Lign._ 92, p. 445. The fish is lying on its\r\nback, with the mouth open, and the opercula, or gill-covers, and the\r\nbranchial arches expanded; the pectoral and ventral fins, and the\r\ndorsal fin, are in their natural position; the five rays of the dorsal\r\nare erect; of the caudal fin, or tail, but slight indications remain.\r\nThere is but one dorsal fin; but in a specimen of _O. Lewesiensis_\r\nthere is a trace of the little adipose process observable between the\r\ndorsal fin and the tail, as in the recent species of _Salmonidæ_. A\r\nmagnified view of one of the scales is represented _Lign. 185, fig.\r\n4_, p. 567.\r\n\r\n[560] They were first described by me in _Foss. South D._ p. 235, tab.\r\nxxxiii. and xl. as _Salmo Lewesiensis_.\r\n\r\nOf the Cyprinoids, or fishes of the Carp family (Malacopterygians), the\r\nrecent species of which are inhabitants either of fresh-water, or the\r\nbrackish waters of the mouths of rivers, many fossil species occur in\r\nthe fluviatile and lacustrine deposits of the Tertiary formations. In\r\ntheir character of omnivorous fishes, the Carps then, as now, formed\r\nthe principal mass of the finny population of the lakes, and in their\r\nturn served as food to the carnivorous tribes, as the pikes, eels,\r\n&c. Several species are found in a beautiful state in the schists of\r\nŒningen, and in the Tertiary marls at Aix. Many of the layers of marl\r\nat the latter locality are covered with groups of fishes of the family\r\n_Cyprinodonts_, the recent species of which are of a small size, and\r\ninhabit the fresh-water lakes of temperate zones. _Lign. 184_, p. 562,\r\nrepresents a portion of a large slab of marl in the cabinet of Sir\r\nR. Murchison, which is covered with scores of a species resembling a\r\nrecent fish (_Lebias_) in the profile of its head, and the form of its\r\nfins. It is named Lebias cephalotes, from the relative largeness of its\r\nhead. The black appearance of the abdomen in many of these Ichthyolites\r\nindicates the original situation of the intestines and of the liver,\r\nwhich is largely developed in the fishes of this family, and contains\r\nmuch colouring matter.\r\n\r\nSaurocephalus and Saurodon. _Lign. 204._--In the same quarry, near\r\nLewes, from which the first entire fish of the Sussex Chalk was\r\nobtained, teeth of a very peculiar character were, many years since,\r\noccasionally discovered.[561] These teeth are of a lanceolate form,\r\nmuch compressed; with entire, sharp edges, terminating in a point;\r\nthe fang is single, and broad; the surface of the crown is glossy,\r\nand marked with fissures filled with chalk (see _Lign. 204, fig.\r\n1_). Teeth of this kind, attached to portions of the jaw, were\r\nsubsequently found in the Chalk at Brighton and Lewes. Similar remains\r\nwere collected from the Cretaceous marls of Missouri and New Jersey,\r\nin the United States. The American specimens comprised two closely\r\nallied genera, which, from the supposition that the fossils were the\r\nrelics of reptiles, were respectively designated _Saurocephalus_ and\r\n_Saurodon_.[562] Examples of the teeth and jaws of both genera have\r\nbeen discovered in the Sussex Chalk (see _Lign. 204_).\r\n\r\n[561] Foss.

Agassiz retains the names imposed by the American naturalists, and\r\nhas placed these genera in the family of Scomberoids (_Mackerel_,\r\n_Swordfish_). They belong to the _Pharyngognathi_ of Muller. The teeth\r\nare disposed in a single row, and fixed in deep sockets by a simple\r\nroot, or fang, which is frequently somewhat excavated by the pressure\r\nof a successional tooth. In _Saurodon Leanus_ the crown of the tooth is\r\nangular, and barbed, and supported on a sub-cylindrical shank, or stem\r\n(see _Lign. 204, fig. 3_). The microscopical structure of these teeth\r\npresents that peculiar reticulated disposition of the medullary canals\r\nthroughout the entire body of the tooth, which is only found in the\r\ndental organs of fishes.\r\n\r\nHypsodon Lewesiensis. (_Foss. South D._ tab. xlii.)--The Sussex\r\nand Kentish Chalk also contain the remains of a very large fish,\r\nbelonging to the Pharyngognathi, with extremely upright, long, conical,\r\ncompressed, pointed teeth, which, like those of the Saurodon, are\r\nimplanted in sockets. These teeth are commonly of a delicate fawn\r\ncolour externally and of a dark brown internally; having a large simple\r\npulp-cavity. In _Foss. South D._ (tab. xlii.) are represented portions\r\nof an intermaxillary and jaw-bone with teeth; a vertebra, deeply\r\nbiconcave; and a large bone, apparently a branch of the _os hyoides_;\r\nall found in the same block of chalk.[563]\r\n\r\n[563] A magnificent specimen (now in the British Museum) displays,\r\non the same slab of chalk, a large portion of the cranium, teeth,\r\nseveral vertebræ, ribs, and many other bones, belonging to a fish of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. _Petrif._ p. 444.\r\n\r\nEnchodus (_sword-tooth_) halocyon. _Lign. 204, fig. 4._ (Poiss.\r\nFoss. tom. v. tab. xxv^_c_.)--The specimen figured is a portion of\r\nthe lower jaw, with one row of elongated, conical, slightly curved,\r\npointed teeth; the two anterior teeth being much longer and larger\r\nthan the others; it affords a good illustration of the dental organs\r\nof _Enchodus_; a genus of Acanthopterygian fishes, the jaws and teeth\r\nof which are often found in the Sussex Chalk. The teeth are of various\r\nsizes, and attached by anchylosis, one row on the premandibular bone,\r\nand another irregular row of smaller teeth to the inside of the lower\r\njaw. The two anterior teeth are very large, and of a peculiar form:\r\ntheir base is wide and solid, and the shank of the tooth is suddenly\r\ncontracted immediately above, and becomes elongated into a point. These\r\nteeth are generally of a dark colour, have a glossy aspect, and are\r\nvery brittle; differing so remarkably in this respect from the shark’s\r\nteeth, with which they are usually collocated, that mere fragments can\r\nbe readily identified. The external surface of the lower jaw is marked\r\nwith finely granulated, longitudinal ridges or striæ.[564]\r\n\r\n[564] A fine example of the lower jaw, with twelve teeth, is figured\r\n_Foss. South D._ tab. xli. and another, with the upper jaw and\r\nteeth, _Geol. S. E._ p. 140. Beautiful figures of the remains of\r\nSaurocephalus, Enchodus, Hypsodon, and many other fine Chalk fishes,\r\nare given in Dixon’s _Fossils of Sussex_, 4to. 1850.\r\n\r\nMr. Toulmin Smith, of Highgate, has in his Museum a portion of the\r\nlower jaw with fifteen teeth of a small individual, imbedded in the\r\ncentre of a flint nodule, from Gravesend, which was discovered by\r\naccidentally breaking the stone. The bone of the jaw and the teeth are\r\nof a dead white colour, and appear not to be in the slightest degree\r\nsilicified; but in those teeth which are broken the pulp-cavity is\r\nfilled with quartz, which must have transuded through the walls of the\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nIchthyolites of recent species.--The distinguished naturalist to\r\nwhose labours in fossil Ichthyology we have been so largely indebted,\r\nstates, that of the many hundred species submitted to his notice, but\r\none can be identified with any fish now living. This conclusion must,\r\nhowever, be received with some reservation; for, among the fossil\r\ngenera, founded on the teeth, there are species which certainly cannot\r\nbe distinguished from recent forms. And in the diluvial drift at\r\nBreslau, associated with the bones of the fossil elephant (_Elephas\r\nprimigenius_), the remains of a pike, closely resembling the common\r\nEuropean species, have lately been discovered.[565]\r\n\r\n[565] Agassiz, _Poiss. Foss._ tom. v. p. 68.\r\n\r\nThe exception above alluded to, is a little Malacopterygian fish,\r\nrather larger than a Sprat, called the Capelan (Mallotus villosus),\r\nwhich inhabits the banks of Newfoundland, and other parts of the coasts\r\nof the northern seas. Fossil specimens of this fish.[566] occur in\r\nnodules of indurated marl or clay, on the coast of Greenland.[567] It\r\nis supposed that these Ichthyolites are of very recent date: and that\r\nsimilar fossils are in the progress of formation.\r\n\r\n[566] See _Poiss. Foss._ tom. v. pl. lx., in which the skeleton of the\r\nrecent fish, and specimens of the fossil species, are represented.\r\n\r\n[567] Similar fossils have been obtained from the \"Drift\" on the Saco\r\nRiver, thirty miles north of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. See Lyell’s\r\nSecond Visit to the United States, vol. i. p. 29.\r\n\r\nIchthyopatolites, or imprints of the pectoral fin-rays of certain\r\nfishes. Under this name Dr. Buckland described certain problematical\r\nmarkings observed on a flag-stone from a coal-pit at Mostyn, in\r\nFlintshire, and now in the Geological Society’s Museum. It consists of\r\ncurvilinear scratches or imprints, disposed symmetrically at regular\r\nintervals on each side a smooth level space, about two inches wide,\r\nwhich may correspond to the body of a fish, the pectoral fins of which\r\nDr. Buckland suggests were the instruments by which the markings in\r\nquestion were formed.\r\n\r\nThese scratches follow each other in nearly equidistant rows of three\r\nin a row, and at intervals of about two inches from the point of each\r\nindividual scratch to the points of those next succeeding and preceding\r\nit; they are slightly convex outwards, three on each side the median\r\nspace, or supposed track of the body of the fish. Dr. Buckland, in\r\nthe memoir referred to, shows that these markings cannot be referable\r\nto the imprint of the feet or claws of reptiles, and points out the\r\nstructure of the bony anterior rays of the pectoral fins, as in certain\r\nSiluroid and Lophoid fishes, and in the Climbing Perch (_Anabas\r\nscandens_), or the _Hassar_ (_Doras costata_), and refers also to the\r\nambulatory movements of the common Gurnard, in corroboration of this\r\nopinion.[568]\r\n\r\n[568] Proceedings of Geol. Society, vol. iv. p. 204.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Geological Distribution of Fossil Fishes._--From the incidental\r\nnotices of the geological habitats of the fossil fishes enumerated in\r\nour survey of this class of beings, the reader cannot fail to have\r\nremarked, that the most recent strata abounded in forms related to the\r\ninhabitants of the existing seas and rivers; while the most ancient\r\nteemed with species and genera of families altogether extinct, or of\r\nprodigious rarity in the recent fauna.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, it may be stated, upon the authority of M. Agassiz,\r\nthat the Ichthyolites of the Tertiary deposits approach in their\r\ncharacters to the living genera, but all the species are extinct. The\r\nnewer Tertiary, as the Crag, contain genera common to tropical seas,\r\nas the large sharks (_Carcharias_), and eagle-rays (_Myliobates_),\r\n&c. In the Eocene, or most ancient Tertiary, as the London and Paris\r\nbasins, Monte Bolca, &c., many of the Ichthyolites are closely related\r\nto recent genera. Of the Chalk fishes, a few only are of recent genera,\r\nbut the majority are still allied to Tertiary forms. In the Chalk,\r\nthe _Pharyngognathi_, _Acanthopteri_, and _Malacopteri_ are met with\r\nas new types; and indications of the _Hybodontidæ_, _Sauroidei_, and\r\n_Cœlacanthi_ (the last derived from the Devonian, and the other two\r\nfrom the Carboniferous Limestone) appear for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe ichthyic fauna of the Cretaceous deposits is closely related by\r\nthe majority of its _family_ groups with that of the series of strata\r\nfrom the Lias to the Wealden, inclusive. In and above the Lias all\r\nthe ganoid fishes are _homocercal_. Below the Lias, the genera and\r\nspecies are far more removed from existing types, and almost all are\r\n_heterocercal_.\r\n\r\nOf the eight thousand living fishes known to naturalists, three-fourths\r\nbelong to the Cycloid and Ctenoid orders, and of these no species are\r\nknown below the Chalk; the other fourth is referable to the Placoids\r\nand Ganoids, of which there are comparatively but few existing\r\nspecies. Yet fishes of these two orders almost solely flourished\r\nduring the ancient Secondary formations; for below the Lias, the\r\npredominant recent orders are altogether absent. Beneath the Coal,\r\ntrue carnivorous fishes, with trenchant teeth, are almost unknown;\r\nbut omnivorous species, with either brush or obtusely conical teeth,\r\nand great sauroid fishes, are the prevailing representatives of the\r\nclass.[569] In fine, the Ichthyolites of the different formations\r\nconstitute two grand groups, which have their boundary line at the base\r\nof the Cretaceous deposits. The first and most ancient comprises the\r\nGanoids and Placoids; the second, more intimately related to existing\r\ntypes, comprehends forms more diversified; these are principally\r\nCtenoid and Cycloid, with a small number of the two preceding orders,\r\nwhich insensibly disappear; and their few living analogues are very\r\ndistinct from the ancient species. Now, although deductions of this\r\nnature may require to be modified with the progress of knowledge,\r\nyet the generalizations thus obtained are founded on so vast an\r\naccumulation of facts and observations, as to render it improbable that\r\nthey will be materially invalidated by future discoveries; for they\r\nremarkably accord with the results derived from the investigation of\r\nthe fossil remains of all the other classes of animals. The most modern\r\ndeposits contain the remains of animals allied to the existing species;\r\nthe most ancient, of forms altogether extinct, or of excessive rarity\r\nin the recent faunas. The discovery of existing species, or genera, in\r\nthe most ancient strata, would modify, but not destroy, the inferences\r\ndeduced from the facts hitherto obtained; and every geologist is\r\nprepared to find that such may be the case.\r\n\r\n[569] In the several chapters on the different formations, as arranged\r\nin the _Wonders_, the student will find succinct notices of the\r\ndistribution of the _genera_ of fishes throughout the fossiliferous\r\ndeposits. A list of the Chalk species known in 1848 is given at pp.\r\n356-359, _Wond._\r\n\r\nThus of the Sharks, with triangular notched teeth, which are so common\r\nin the Tertiary formations, and were formerly unknown in the ancient\r\nSecondary, one representative has been found in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem (see p. 595). But, if teeth of this type should hereafter be\r\ndiscovered in every Secondary deposit, the great preponderance of these\r\nfishes over the Sauroid in the Tertiary, and in the existing seas,\r\nwould not be the less remarkable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Collecting and Developing Fossil Fishes.--From what has been\r\nadvanced, the reader will have obtained a general knowledge of the\r\nfossil remains of this class that are likely to be met with in\r\nparticular deposits. Thus, he will expect to find the teeth of large\r\nsharks and rays in the Tertiary clays and sands; and skeletons and\r\nperfect specimens of numerous Ctenoid and Cycloid fishes in the\r\nlaminated marls and fine limestones of the same formations. In the\r\nChalk, with numerous teeth of sharks, he may discover splendid examples\r\nof Cycloid and Ctenoid fishes; and, in the Wealden, large Ganoidian\r\nforms. Passing to the ancient Secondary strata, the extraordinary\r\nbuckler-headed and Sauroid fishes will arrest his attention; and\r\ntheir vestiges will be found, more or less perfect, in the shales and\r\nlimestones, and in the indurated nodules of clay and sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe detached teeth of fishes in Tertiary sands and clays may be easily\r\nobtained entire, and should be arranged in the same manner as the\r\nshells (see p. 442), either in trays, or on boards. The triangular\r\nteeth, with lateral denticles, must be carefully extracted, so as\r\nto preserve those appendages on which the specific and generic\r\ndistinctions of many Ichthyolites depend. M. Agassiz particularly\r\nrecommends the preservation of all the specimens collected together in\r\nthe same locality, as many may probably belong to the same individual,\r\nand thus the dental organization of the original be determined.\r\nTeeth collected from the same stratum in different places, should\r\nnot, therefore, be mixed together. Several series of the same kind of\r\nteeth should be preserved, and as many as possible of each kind; for\r\nspecimens apparently identical may prove to be highly instructive as a\r\nseries. I have often had occasion to regret the disposal of supposed\r\nduplicates, in my earlier researches, which would have tended to\r\nelucidate the characters of those specimens which were retained.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyolites, and their detached teeth and fins, in the Chalk and\r\nother soft limestones, may be cleared by means of a penknife or graver\r\nand small sharp chisels. It is preferable to leave the teeth attached\r\nto small blocks of the chalk; as in the examples, figured _Lign.\r\n193_. But to develop the beautiful Chalk Ichthyolites, particularly\r\nthose of the Osmeroides, Macropoma, &c. some practice and considerable\r\ndexterity are required. The compressed fishes, as the Beryx, like\r\nthose in the Tertiary limestones, often lie in the sedimentary plane\r\nof the stone, and may be sufficiently exposed, by a blow of a hammer\r\nor a pick, to show the nature of the fossil, and admit of being easily\r\ndeveloped. But the fishes with sub-cylindrical bodies very commonly\r\nsplit asunder in a transverse direction: and those with spinous scales,\r\nas the Macropoma, adhere so firmly to the chalk, that, to display the\r\nexternal surface of their scales, the surrounding stone must be removed\r\npiecemeal, in the manner described for the Chalk crustaceans (see p.\r\n544). The collector who sees the splendid Chalk fishes in the British\r\nMuseum,[570] and learns that they were found in the Chalk of Kent and\r\nSussex, will be grievously disappointed, upon visiting the quarries\r\nfrom which they were obtained, if he expects to discover specimens with\r\nany considerable portion of the scales, or body, exposed. It was many\r\nyears before the quarry-men acquired the tact they now possess, of\r\ndetecting, from very slight evidence, the presence of an Ichthyolite\r\nin a block of chalk: patches of scales, which the quarry-men called\r\n\"_bran_,\" and detached sharks’ teeth, \"_birds beaks_,\" and \"_snakes'\r\ntongues_,\" and teeth of Ptychodus, \"_slugs_,\" being the only remains of\r\nfishes generally observed and laid aside by the workmen.\r\n\r\n[570] _Petrifactions_, pp. 441, 444.\r\n\r\nThe fossil _Salmon_ or _Smelt_ (see p. 626), which may be considered\r\nas one of the most extraordinary of the Chalk fishes found in England,\r\naffords an excellent illustration of the mode of developing the\r\nIchthyolites of this formation. This interesting fossil is delineated\r\non a small scale, in three different states, in _Plate II._; and\r\naffords a good practical lesson for the young collector. Among some\r\nblocks of chalk which a recent fall in one of the quarries near Lewes\r\nhad brought to light, was a large mass split asunder, and exposing on\r\neach corresponding surface an irregular oval marking of a yellowish\r\nbrown colour; this appearance is represented _Pl. II. _fig._ 1_.\r\nPresuming that these markings were produced by a transverse section of\r\nthe body of a fish, the two blocks were trimmed into a portable size,\r\nand accurately cemented together with very _hot, thin, fresh_ glue.\r\nWhen consolidated, some of the chalk was chiselled off in the supposed\r\nlongitudinal direction of the enclosed fish, and part of the body,\r\ncovered with scales, was exposed, as _Pl. II. fig. 2_. With the view\r\nof ascertaining the extent of the Ichthyolite, some of the surrounding\r\nstone was then removed towards each extremity of the block, and traces\r\nof the fish were discovered, as shown in the same figure. The task of\r\ncompletely developing the fossil was thus rendered comparatively easy;\r\nthe chalk was chiselled, cut, and scraped away, till the perfect fish,\r\nas seen in _fig._ 3, was developed.[571] The block was then reduced to\r\na convenient size, and the edges sawn smooth. The chalk is easily cut\r\nwith a carpenter’s saw; the instrument should be short and strong, and\r\nthe teeth of moderate size.\r\n\r\n[571] The figure in _Pl. II._ is too small to convey an accurate\r\nidea of this Ichthyolite, which is now in the British Museum; see\r\n_Petrifactions_, pp. 445, 446. M. Agassiz’s figure very inaccurately\r\nrepresents the original. A beautiful lithograph of this fish, by Mr.\r\nPollard, of Brighton, was published in the Catalogue of the Mantellian\r\nMuseum, 1836.\r\n\r\nWhen a _portion_ of the body of an Ichthyolite of this kind is found in\r\na block of chalk, and the fracture of the block appears to be recent,\r\ndiligent search should be made for the corresponding piece; for it may\r\nprobably be found to contain the other part of the fish. A splendid\r\nspecimen of _Osmeroides Lewesiensis_, more than a foot long, was thus\r\nobtained. The quarry-men, in a block of chalk which a recent fall had\r\nthrown down, discovered a few inches of the caudal portion of the\r\nbody of a fish; on the broken surface of the stone, a section of the\r\nbody was distinctly seen, as in the specimen previously described.\r\nSearch was made among the fallen masses for the corresponding piece,\r\nbut without success. Upon observing the face of the quarry exposed by\r\nthe recent fall, on a projecting block, many yards above our reach, a\r\ndiscoloured spot was indistinctly seen, and it was conjectured that\r\nthis might prove to be the other moiety of the Ichthyolite. The workmen\r\nwere directed to preserve this block if possible; but it remained _in\r\nsitu_ several months, and until the rock was again blasted; when the\r\nstone so long coveted rolled away from the fallen mass, and fortunately\r\nwas soon discovered. It proved to be the corresponding portion of the\r\nfish; with the head, opercula, branchial arches, pectoral fins, and\r\nthe anterior part of the body covered with beautiful cycloid scales.\r\nIn the preparation of fossils of this kind, glue as the cement, and a\r\npaste made of plaster of Paris with thin glue, to fill up the crevices\r\nand strengthen the block, are the materials I have employed. The fossil\r\nremains of fishes in other rocks require to be extracted and developed\r\nin the manner previously directed for the Echinoderms, Cephalopoda,\r\n&c. (pp. 332, 497.)\r\n\r\nThe collector may be reminded, that _Otolithes_, or ear-stones (p.\r\n574), are found in the Crag of Norfolk, and other Tertiary strata;\r\nand that Coprolites, associated with minute scales, bones, &c. of\r\nsmall fishes, constitute, in some localities, layers of considerable\r\nthickness and of great extent. The \"_bone-bed_\" of the Lias, near\r\nWestbury, and that of the Ludlow series on the banks of the Teme, near\r\nLudlow,[572] are well-known examples of such a deposit.\r\n\r\n[572] See Mr. Strickland’s interesting notice of the distribution and\r\ncontents of this \"bone-bed,\" in the Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. ix. p. 8\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopical Examination.--A few words on the microscopical\r\nexamination of the remains of fishes may be useful. The structure of\r\nthe large, and the forms of the minute scales, may be seen by a common\r\nlens, and without preparing the specimens. But for the examination\r\nof the intimate organization of scales, teeth, &c. the microscope is\r\nrequired; and the method directed for the investigation of flint (p.\r\n373) should be employed. The scales, portions of the membranes of\r\nthe air-bladder, stomach, &c. and thin chips of the teeth, rendered\r\ntemporarily transparent by oil of turpentine, or permanently so\r\nby Canada balsam, should be viewed by transmitted light. But the\r\nintricate structure of the dental organs, the medullary canals, and the\r\ncalcigerous tubes, cannot be successfully investigated without the aid\r\nof the lapidary, or the adoption of the process described at page 67\r\nfor the preparation of fossil wood for microscopical examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL FISHES.\r\n\r\n ⁂ The detached teeth, scales, vertebræ, &c. of fishes are so\r\n extensively distributed, that there is scarcely a cliff or quarry\r\n of fossiliferous rock in Great Britain, that does not contain some\r\n examples.

Agassiz,\r\n Poiss. Foss.\r\n\r\n Aix, in Provence. _Tertiary._ Some of the beds of gypseous marl\r\n   contain numerous species in abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n Eisleben, Upper Saxony. _Permian._ Numerous Ichthyolites in dark shale.\r\n\r\n\r\n Glaris, Switzerland. _Cret._ Immense numbers of fishes in dark schist.\r\n   The specimens are often contorted, from the contraction of their\r\n   bodies, during decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n Maestricht (St. Peter’s Mountain). _Upper Cret._ Numerous teeth,\r\n   vertebræ, &c. of fishes of the Cretaceous epoch.

See _Wond._ p. 263.\r\n\r\n\r\n Saarbrück, in Lorraine. _Carb._ _Amblypterus_, and other Carboniferous\r\n   fishes.\r\n\r\n Seefeld, in the Tyrol; on the principal road from Insbruck to Munich.\r\n   _Lias._ Abundance of fish in bituminous slate.\r\n\r\n Stabia, Italy, at Torre d’Orlando, near Castellamare. _Oolite._\r\n   Beautiful fishes in fissile limestone.\r\n\r\n Solenhofen. _Oolite._ Numerous Ichthyolites; many in great perfection.\r\n   See _Wond._ p. 513.\r\n\r\n[573] It is necessary to caution the collector against the frauds\r\npractised by the quarry-men, and dealers in fossils, at this and other\r\ncelebrated foreign localities. Specimens, apparently perfect, are\r\ningeniously constructed from the fragments of various examples. The\r\nhead of one fish, the body of another, decorated with the fins of a\r\nthird, and perhaps the tail of a fourth, of different species, or even\r\ngenera, are dove-tailed together, coloured, and varnished, so as to\r\ndeceive the common observer, and, occasionally, even the experienced\r\ncollector. Sponging the specimens with cold water will often detect the\r\nimposition; for the colour if artificial will be removed, or rendered\r\npaler, while the same process will heighten the natural tints. At\r\nPappenheim, Solenhofen, and other places, where fossil crustaceans, as\r\nShrimps, Prawns, &c. are found in such perfection, the imprints of good\r\nspecimens are often coloured, and offered for sale; a wet sponge will\r\nspeedily detect the imposture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL REPTILES; COMPRISING THE ENALIOSAURIANS AND CROCODILES.\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Nous remontons done à un autre âge du monde; à cet âge où la terre\r\n n’étoit encore parcourue que par des reptiles a sang froid--où la mer\r\n abondoit en ammonites, en bélemnites, en térébratules, en encrinites,\r\n et où tous ces genres, aujourd’hui d’une rareté prodigieuse, faisoient\r\n le fond de sa population.\"--Cuvier, _Oss. Foss._ tom. v. p. 10.\r\n\r\nWe advance now to the investigation of the fossil remains of the more\r\nhighly organized classes of the Vertebrata; the Fishes being the\r\nlowest in the scale amongst the beings characterised by an osseous\r\nskeleton, with a flexible spinal column, composed of articulated bones,\r\nand presenting, in the various classes, orders, genera, and species,\r\nnumerous modifications of form and structure. The mineralized relics\r\nof the vertebrated animals consist, for the most part, of single and\r\ndisplaced bones, or groups of bones and teeth, and the durable portions\r\nof the dermal integuments; entire skeletons being of rare occurrence.\r\nA knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and access to anatomical and\r\nzoological libraries and collections, are therefore indispensable for\r\nthe cultivation of this most attractive department of Palæontology.\r\nFortunately for the English student, this branch of the science, which\r\na few years since was but little cultivated in this country,[574] has\r\nbeen greatly advanced, by the liberal support afforded by the British\r\nAssociation of Science to Professor Owen, whose Reports on the British\r\nFossil Reptiles and Mammalia, published in the Transactions of the\r\nAssociation,[575] should be referred to for more precise and detailed\r\ninformation than can be given in these unpretending volumes. Our\r\nremarks will be limited to a general notice of the fossil remains of\r\nReptiles, Birds, and Mammals; with descriptions of such characteristic\r\nexamples, as will serve to illustrate the nature of the specimens that\r\nmay probably come under the notice of the collector; or which, from\r\ntheir peculiar characters, are objects worthy his special attention.\r\n\r\n[574] See _Petrif._ p. 226, note.\r\n\r\n[575] Report of the Brit. Assoc. 1839 and 1841; see also Trans.

Subsequent observations and discoveries have,\r\nhowever, fully confirmed the truth of this induction, and the \"_Age of\r\nReptiles_\" is no longer considered fabulous.\r\n\r\n[576] \"_The Age of Reptiles_\" was the title given by the author to\r\na popular summary of the evidence bearing on this question: it was\r\npublished in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, 1831. This name is\r\nnow generally employed to designate the geological epochs characterised\r\nby the predominance of oviparous quadrupeds; namely, from the Permian\r\nto the Chalk, inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn some of the ancient fossiliferous deposits,[577] indications of\r\nthe existence of Reptiles are visible, in the indelible markings left\r\nby their footsteps on the muddy banks of rivers, and on the wet sands\r\nof the sea-shores, now in the state of layers of marl and sandstone.\r\nHere and there in the Devonian,[578] Carboniferous, and New Red\r\nformations, teeth and bones are found, presenting unequivocal proofs\r\nof the presence of extinct forms of cold-blooded oviparous quadrupeds.\r\nAs we ascend in the secondary formations, we are suddenly surrounded\r\nby innumerable marine and terrestrial reptiles, belonging to species\r\nand genera, and even orders, of which no living representatives are\r\nknown. Throughout the Liassic, Oolitic, Wealden, and Cretaceous epochs,\r\nthe class of Reptiles was at its fullest development. In the Tertiary\r\nperiods which succeeded, the Reptiles approach the recent types, and\r\ntheir relics are found intermingled with the bones of mammiferous\r\nquadrupeds; thus indicating the commencement of the present condition\r\nand relations of the animal kingdom. Referring the reader to _Bd._ p.\r\n165, and _Wond._ pp. 409-444 and 567-588, for a more comprehensive view\r\nof this subject, we advance to the examination of some of the fossil\r\ngenera and species; and we propose, in the first place, to explain a\r\nfew essential characters of form and structure observable in those\r\ndurable parts of the skeletons which are most frequently met with in a\r\nfossil state; namely, the teeth, jaws, vertebræ, &c., and the osseous\r\nappendages of the dermal system.\r\n\r\n[577] Devonian rooks of Elgin, North Britain; and the Lower\r\nCarboniferous of Pottsville, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[578] The most ancient Reptile hitherto discovered is the _Telerpeton\r\nElginense_, from the Old Red of Scotland, which will be described in\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\nThe animals comprehended in the Class of Reptilia constitute, according\r\nto Prof. Owen’s arrangement, eight principal groups, or Orders, as\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n    The _Batrachia_; Frogs: the body naked,     }\r\n      with only rudimentary ribs; and with      }\r\n      two or four feet. Most of these reptiles  }\r\n      breathe by branchiæ or gills in their     }\r\n      young state, and by lungs in the adult    }\r\n      (as for example the Frog); in some (the   }\r\n      _perenni-branchiata_), the branchiæ are   }\r\n      persistent through life.                  } Having a tripartite\r\n                                                } heart (_i. e._ with\r\n    The _Ophidia_; Serpents: the body           } two auricles and\r\n      destitute of feet.                        } one ventricle), and\r\n                                                } simple transverse\r\n    The _Lacertia_ or _Sauria_; Lizards: the    } processes to the\r\n       body supported by four or two feet, and  } cervical and anterior\r\n       covered with scales.                     } dorsal vertebræ.\r\n                                                }\r\n    The _Chelonia_; Tortoises: the body         }\r\n      supported by four feet or paddles, and    }\r\n      enveloped in two osseous bucklers,        }\r\n      composed of the expanded bones of the     }\r\n      sternum and thorax.                       }\r\n\r\n    The _Enaliosauria_; Sea-saurians            }\r\n      (_extinct_): body furnished with four     }\r\n      paddles, and destitute of scaly covering. }\r\n                                                }\r\n    The _Pterosauria_; Wing-saurians            }\r\n      (_extinct_): body supported on four       } Having a quadripartite\r\n      feet, the outer finger of each fore-foot  } heart (_i. e._ with two\r\n      greatly lengthened, and forming a support } auricles and two\r\n      for the wing.                             } ventricles),and double\r\n                                                } transverse processes to\r\n    The _Crocodilia_; Crocodiles: body          } the cervical and anterior\r\n      supported on four partially webbed feet,  } dorsal vertebræ.\r\n      and encased with an armour of bony plates }\r\n      or scutes.                                }\r\n                                                }\r\n    The _Deinosauria_; Great-saurians           }\r\n      (_extinct_): body supported on four feet. }\r\n\r\n\r\nTeeth of Reptiles.--The teeth of the animals of this class exhibit\r\nconsiderable diversity of form, but the characteristic type is that\r\nof a conical, pointed tooth, with a simple root or fang; for, _in no\r\nreptile does the base of the tooth terminate in more than one fang,\r\nand this is never branched_. \"Any fossil, therefore, which exhibits a\r\ntooth implanted by two fangs in a double socket, must be mammiferous,\r\nsince the socketed teeth of reptiles have but a single fang; and the\r\nonly fishes’ teeth which approach such a tooth in form, are those of a\r\nbifurcate base, belonging to certain sharks.\" (_Owen._)\r\n\r\nThese dental organs are only fitted for seizing and retaining the\r\nprey or food; for no living reptiles have the power of performing\r\nmastication. In the Crocodiles the tooth has a cylindrical shank,\r\nwith a conical, longitudinally striated, enamelled crown, having a\r\nridge on each side (_Pl. VI. fig. 5_). In the _Labyrinthodon_ (a\r\nfossil reptile), the cone is more curved and pointed (_Pl. VI. fig.\r\n3_); in the _Hylæosaurus_, the shank is cylindrical, and the crown\r\nexpanded and lanceolate, with blunt margins (_Pl. VI. fig. 6_); in\r\nthe _Megalosaurus_, the tooth is laterally compressed, trenchant, and\r\nslightly inclined backwards like a sabre, with serrated edges (_Pl. VI.\r\nfig. 7_); in the _Iguanodon_, the shank is cylindrical, and the crown\r\nof a prismatic form, greatly expanded, with broad denticulated edges,\r\nand longitudinal ridges on one side (_Pl. VI. fig. 4_, and _Ligns._\r\n221, 223). In the Serpents, the teeth are very long and pointed; in the\r\nCrocodiles and Lizards, may be seen every modification of the conical\r\nform, down to a mere hemispherical tubercle or plate. In the fossil\r\n_Dicynodon_, to be hereafter described, the dental system consists of\r\nbut two tusks or canine teeth, like those of the Walrus, implanted in\r\nthe upper jaw. The Turtles and some fossil Lacertians are edentulous,\r\n_i. e._ destitute of teeth; their dental organs consisting of the horny\r\ntrenchant sheaths with which the jaws are covered.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are very numerous in reptiles; the individuals of some\r\nspecies have more than two hundred. In some genera, they are implanted\r\non the jaws alone; in many, they occupy the palatine, vomerine, and\r\nother bones composing the vault of the mouth, as in certain fishes. The\r\nteeth are generally anchylosed to the bone; but in some genera they are\r\nimplanted in distinct sockets, as in the Crocodile and Plesiosaurus; in\r\nothers, as in the Ichthyosaurus, they are arranged in a deep furrow,\r\nand retained only by the integuments; in some, they are supported upon\r\nan elevated osseous base. In the Labyrinthodonts, and in the greater\r\npart of the Serpent tribes, the tooth is implanted by the base in a\r\nshallow socket, with which it is confluent.\r\n\r\nIn most of the Lacertians, or true Lizards, the attachment of the teeth\r\npresents a peculiar modification, of which the lower jaw of the Iguana,\r\n_Lign. 205_, p. 649, affords a good illustration. The teeth are not\r\nplaced in sockets, but are attached by the shank to an alveolar plate,\r\nor parapet, that extends along the margin of the jaw, as shown in\r\n_figs._ 1 and 3; the crowns of the teeth project above this plate, as\r\nseen in _figs._ 2 and 4. From the anchylosis of the teeth to the side\r\nof the jaw, the Lizards possessing this dental structure are termed\r\n_Pleurodonts_.[579]\r\n\r\n[579] The _Pleurodonts_ are those lizards in which the teeth are\r\nanchylosed to the _side_ of the dentary bone; _Acrodonts_, those\r\nwith the teeth fixed to the upper margin or _ridge_ of the jaw-bone;\r\n_Thecodonts_, those having the teeth implanted, either loosely, or\r\nanchylosed to the walls of their sockets. Lacertians are also said to\r\nbe _Pleodont_ (having solid teeth), or _Cœlodont_ (hollow-toothed).\r\n\r\nIn reptiles, we have, therefore, five essential modifications in the\r\nattachment of the teeth; namely, in distinct sockets; in a continuous\r\ngroove or furrow; attached laterally by the shank to an alveolar\r\nparapet; anchylosed by the base to a shallow socket; and attached to an\r\nosseous support, without sockets or an alveolar plate.[580]\r\n\r\n[580] See the beautiful exemplification of this subject, and the\r\ncomparison between the transitory stages of the human teeth in their\r\nprogress of development, discovered by Mr. Goodsir, with the permanency\r\nof these conditions in reptiles.

The Lower Jaw of an Iguana.\r\n\r\n(_From Barbadoes._)]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--The right branch of the lower jaw of an Iguana; viewed on\r\n           its inner aspect. _Nat. size._\r\n           _a._ Dentary bone.\r\n           _b._ Opercular bone.\r\n           _c._ Complementary or coronoid bone.\r\n           _d._ Surangular bone.\r\n           _e._ Angular bone.\r\n           _f._ Articular bone.\r\n       2.--The external aspect of the same.\r\n       3.--Inner aspect of three teeth (_magnified_) attached to the alveolar\r\n           parapet; with the germ of a successional tooth at the base\r\n           of the middle tooth; and the sockets of other germs at the\r\n           bases of the outer two fully formed teeth.\r\n       4.--External view of the crowns of three teeth; slightly magnified.\r\n\r\nThe intimate structure of the teeth consists of a simple pulp-cavity,\r\nsurrounded by dentine, which is permeated by extremely minute\r\ncalcigerous tubes, radiating at right angles to the periphery, or\r\nexternal surface of the tooth. One essential modification of this\r\nstructure consists in the intermingling of cylindrical processes of\r\nthe pulp-cavity, in the form of medullary or vascular canals, with\r\nthe finer tubular structure; as in the tooth of the Iguanodon, _Pl.\r\nVI. figs. 4^b_ and _4^c_. But another modification is that to which\r\nallusion was made when describing the teeth of the Lepidosteus (see\r\np. 616); in this mode, the dentine preserves its normal character, but\r\nthe external cement and surface of the tooth are deeply inflected in\r\nlongitudinal folds around the entire circumference; and this structure\r\nis accompanied with corresponding extensions of the pulp-cavity\r\nand dentine into the interspaces of these inflected and converging\r\nfolds.[581] This organization is shown, in its simplest form, in the\r\ntransverse section of the base of a tooth of the Ichthyosaurus, _Pl.\r\nVI. fig. 9_; and attains its most complicated condition in that of the\r\nLabyrinthodon, _Pl. VI. figs. 3^a, 3^b, 3^c_.\r\n\r\n[581] There is a marked difference between the internal structure\r\nof the teeth of true Saurians and of Sauroid Fishes. In the former,\r\nas well as in the _Enaliosauria_, the dentine consists of tubes\r\nradiating from a slender central pulp-cavity to the periphery of the\r\ntooth, without any intermixture of vascular canals. In the sauroid\r\nfish (_Dendrodus_) the central pulp-cavity is produced into numerous\r\nirregular canals, from which vascular sinuses radiate to the\r\nperiphery, sending off branches generally at right angles throughout\r\ntheir entire course; thus, there is an extensive distribution of the\r\nvascular system through the body of the tooth, which does not exist in\r\nany saurian reptile; the nearest analogy is in the labyrinthine teeth\r\nof the gigantic fossil batrachians. (_Owen_: Odontography; and Art.\r\nTeeth, Cyclop. Anat.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the mode of development of the teeth, we must briefly\r\nstate, that the germ of the new tooth is always produced at the side\r\nof the base of the old one; that in its progress of growth it presses\r\nagainst the tooth it is destined to supplant, occasions the progressive\r\nabsorption of the fang, and ultimately displaces its predecessor;\r\nin some instances, by splitting the crown of the tooth; in others,\r\nby casting it off, according to the oblique or direct position the\r\nnew tooth attains in its progress, in relation to its predecessor.\r\nThus, in the teeth of the Crocodile, the new tooth is generally found\r\nimmediately under the conical apex of the crown, and beneath the former\r\na second successional tooth appears, like a series of thimbles of\r\nvarious sizes placed one upon another; for in reptiles the production\r\nof new teeth is unlimited. But in the _Pleurodont_ lizards, the new\r\ntooth makes its way obliquely, and the crown is often shed entire.\r\n_Lign. 205, fig. 3_, exemplifies the situation of the successional\r\nteeth in the Iguana.\r\n\r\nLower Jaw of Reptiles.--It is well known that the lower jaw in\r\nmammiferous animals is composed of a single bone on each side; and\r\nthat in many genera these pieces become united in front, and form\r\nbut one bone in the adult state. But in reptiles, the lower jaw\r\nconsists of six distinct bones on each side, as in _Lign. 205_; and\r\nthese undergo various modifications of form and arrangement in the\r\ndifferent genera. These bones are distinguished by names which have\r\nreference to their office and situation, and are as follow:--_Lign.\r\n205, a_, the _dentary_ bone, supporting the teeth; _b_, the _splenial_\r\nor _opercular_; _c_, the _coronoid_ or _complementary_; _d_, the\r\n_sur-angular_; _e_, the _angular_; _f_, the _articular_, which forms\r\nthe upper portion of the jaw, and includes the condyle. The form and\r\ndisposition of these bones in the Iguana, and other true lizards, are\r\nshown in _Lign. 205_; but they differ materially in the Crocodile,\r\nIchthyosaurus, and other genera. We must restrict our comments to this\r\nshort notice, which, however, will suffice to enable the collector who\r\ndiscovers a fragment of a lower jaw, with any traces of the structure\r\nabove described, to determine that it is reptilian; and if any portion\r\nof the _dentary_ bone remains, indications may be obtained of the\r\nfamily, and perhaps genus, to which it belonged.[582]\r\n\r\n[582] To obtain a correct knowledge of the osteological structure of\r\nfossil Reptiles, the student should consult Baron Cuvier’s _Ossemens\r\nFossiles_, tom. v. To the English reader, the translated abridgement of\r\nCuvier’s \"Fossil Remains of the Animal Kingdom,\" by E. Pidgeon, 1 vol.\r\n8vo. with plates, 1830, will be found a very instructive volume. See\r\nalso Penny Cyclopædia, Art. Saurians.\r\n\r\nVertebræ of Reptiles.--The bones of the vertebral column of this class\r\nof animals present such numerous and important modifications in the\r\ndifferent orders and families, that reference to the works already\r\ncited must be made for satisfactory information on this topic. From the\r\ngreat number of vertebræ in many reptiles, amounting in the individuals\r\nof some species to nearly two hundred, these bones are the most\r\nabundant fossil relics of these animals to be found in our collections.\r\nThe vertebræ are commonly detached, and deprived of their processes;\r\nthe solid _centrum_, or body, alone remaining in most examples (as in\r\n_Lign. 206, fig. 8_). Connected series, more or less complete, are\r\noccasionally discovered; and the entire column, in connexion with other\r\nparts of the skeleton, is preserved in many specimens in the British\r\nand other museums.[583] Although, for the reasons previously stated,\r\nminute osteological details cannot be attempted in this work, some\r\nacquaintance with the elementary characters of the bones composing the\r\nspinal column, and of the nomenclature employed to distinguish them,\r\nis necessary to guide the student, and even the amateur collector, in\r\ntheir researches. I have, therefore, selected a few specimens from\r\nTilgate Forest in illustration of the elements of Saurian vertebræ, and\r\nof the terms by which the different processes are distinguished; the\r\ngeneral reader will thus be enabled to comprehend the descriptions of\r\nthese structures in other works on Palæontology.\r\n\r\n[583] See _Petrifactions_, pp. 136-352, and pp. 362-387.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 206.

To effect this purpose, there is attached to the upper or\r\ndorsal part of each vertebra a bony ring, called the neural-arch, which\r\nis composed of two processes (_Lign. 206, b._), arising from each\r\nside of the body or centrum (_Lign. 206, a._), and which unite above\r\ninto a solid piece, termed the spinal process, ox neural spine (_Lign.\r\n206, d._). On each side of the annular paid there is a process, called\r\nthe transverse (_Lign. 206, e, e._), for the attachment of muscles;\r\nand in the middle and the posterior dorsal regions of some reptiles,\r\nas, for example, in the existing Crocodiles, these processes articulate\r\nwith the ribs. The vertebræ of the tail have, in addition to the above,\r\nan inferior spinous process, termed the chevron-bone (_Lign. 206,\r\nfig. 2_, and _fig. 3, f_.), which gives support to the inferior\r\nlayers of the caudal muscles; and, bifurcating at its attachment to the\r\nbody of the vertebra, leaves a channel for the passage of the large\r\nblood-vessels, by which the circulation of the tail is effected.\r\n\r\nIn the generality of living reptiles (as, for example, in the\r\nCrocodile) the bodies of the vertebræ are concave in front, and convex\r\nbehind; the bones of the spine being united by ball-and-socket joints;\r\nbut, in most fossil reptiles, both faces are either flat, or more or\r\nless concave. In mammalian quadrupeds, the annular part is anchylosed\r\nto the vertebral centre; but in reptiles, it is united by suture,\r\nalthough, in old subjects, the connecting line is often obliterated. By\r\nreference to _Lign. 206_, and its description, the form, arrangement,\r\nand connexion of the different vertebral elements, in certain fossil\r\nreptiles, may be easily understood. The bones in the vertebral column\r\nof the same animal are considerably modified in the several regions\r\nof the neck (_cervical_ vertebræ), back (_dorsal_ and _lumbar_), and\r\ntail (_caudal_). The cervical are generally of the most complicated\r\nstructure; and the caudal, the most simple.\r\n\r\nFrom this exposition, the reader will perceive that every vertebra\r\nconsists of the following essential parts: first, the body, or\r\n_centrum_; and secondly, the annular part, or _neural arch_, so named,\r\nbecause it protects the nervous chord; while a caudal vertebra has,\r\nin addition, the chevron-bone, called also the _hæmal arch_, from its\r\naffording a passage to the large blood-vessels. The bodies of the\r\nvertebræ are in general solid, and consist of the ordinary osseous\r\nstructure; but in certain fossil vertebræ the centre of the bone is\r\nfilled with calcareous spar, indicating an irregular medullary cavity,\r\nas in the caudal vertebræ of the Ox.[584]\r\n\r\n[584] See _Petrifactions_, p. 166, _note_.\r\n\r\nThe _Sacrum_, which may be termed the key-stone of the pelvic arch, is\r\nformed in existing reptiles by the union of two vertebræ; but in the\r\nIguanodon and the Hylæosaurus the sacrum is composed of six anchylosed\r\nvertebræ; in the Megalosaurus probably of but five.[585]\r\n\r\n[585] Report, Brit. Assoc. 1841, p. 105, and p. 130.\r\n\r\nFrom the sides of the two anchylosed vertebræ which form the sacrum,\r\nstrong, short, rib-like processes are given off in those Saurians which\r\noccasionally walk on dry land, and these constitute a firm support to\r\nthe hinder extremities.\r\n\r\nIn the Crocodiles, the four or five vertebræ preceding the sacrum\r\nhave no ribs attached to them, and are termed _lumbar_; in the\r\nLizards, there are but two lumbar vertebræ. A peculiar modification\r\nexists in the first caudal vertebra of the adult Gavial and Crocodile;\r\nthe _centrum_ is _convex_ both in front and behind, as was first\r\ndemonstrated by me in 1836. See _Wond._ p. 419, and _Petrif._ p. 167.\r\nThe last of the anchylosed vertebræ forming the sacrum is concave\r\nposteriorly; hence the necessity of an anterior ball in the first joint\r\nof the tail. (See _Lign. 217_, p. 676, illustrative of _Crocodilus\r\nHastingsiæ_.) The last _cervical_ vertebra in the Turtles and Tortoises\r\nhas a similar construction. This mechanism confers freedom of motion\r\nwithout risk of dislocation.\r\n\r\nRibs.--The Ribs, which are regarded as appendages to the vertebræ,\r\n(homologues of the pleurapophyses,) are generally slender and round in\r\nthe Lizards, and articulate with the spinal column by a single head,\r\nsupported on a short convex process or tubercle. In Crocodiles only\r\nof all existing Reptiles, but in several extinct genera, the proximal\r\nend of the rib forms a double articulation, by a distinct head and a\r\ntubercle, with the vertebræ in the cervical and anterior dorsal region\r\nof the spinal column; in the posterior dorsal region the ribs are\r\nattached to the elongated transverse processes of the vertebræ.\r\n\r\nAs this double articulation of the ribs is invariably associated in\r\nexisting reptiles with a heart having double ventricles, while the\r\nlacertian single-headed ribs are in like manner connected with a heart\r\nhaving but one ventricle, the student will perceive the important\r\nphysiological inferences that spring from the discovery of a mere\r\nfragment of a rib, when interpreted by the profound anatomist.[586] In\r\nsome fossil reptiles the ribs are flat and very broad; as, for example,\r\nin the Hylæosaurus.[587]\r\n\r\n[586] See Brit. Assoc. Report, 1841, and Memoirs, Palæont. Soc.\r\n\r\n[587] In Crocodiles the abdominal region is strengthened by slender\r\nribs (_hæmapophyses_, Prof. Owen), that are affixed to a ligamentous\r\nextension of the cartilaginous sternum, analogous to the _linea alba_\r\nin man; and the Hylæosaurus appears to have possessed a similar\r\ndevelopment of the costal elements, for I observed many fragments of\r\nlong, slender, sub-cylindrical rib-like bones whilst chiselling off the\r\nstone from this species, and portions of similar bones occur in the\r\nstone around the spinal column from Bolney. In the Maidstone Iguanodon\r\nthere are likewise some long slender bones of this character, which I\r\nthink must be prolongations of the ordinary dorsal ribs.\r\n\r\nExtremities.--The locomotive extremities are variously constructed,\r\naccording to the adaptation of the animals to a terrestrial,\r\nfluviatile, or marine existence. The bones of the limbs in the\r\nextinct colossal terrestrial species much resemble those of our large\r\npachydermata, the Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus. The cylindrical bones\r\nof the extremities in the Crocodilians, and other recent reptiles, are\r\nsolid. _i. e._ have no cavity filled with marrow; such also is the case\r\nin the fossil Enaliosaurians; but the thigh-bones and leg-bones of the\r\nIguanodon, and of other extinct land saurians, h ave a large medullary\r\ncanal. Our limits will not admit of further osteological details; and\r\nwe are compelled to omit the description of the bones composing the\r\nthoracic and pelvic arches.\r\n\r\nDermal Bones. _Ligns._ 207 and 208. In many of the reptile tribes,\r\nparticularly of the Crocodilian or loricated (_mailed_) group, there\r\nare immediately under the external integument or skin a series of\r\nosseous scutes, or scutcheons, variously arranged, which serve as\r\nsupports to the integumental scales and spines. In the gigantic Gavial,\r\nthat inhabits the Ganges and other rivers of India, and which is\r\nremarkably distinguished from the common Crocodile and Alligator by an\r\nextremely elongated slender muzzle, the nape of the neck is protected\r\nby sixteen or eighteen transverse rows of dermal scutes; and there are\r\nlikewise six rows which extend down the back. These bones are deeply\r\ncorrugated or sculptured on their upper surface; a structure adapted\r\nfor the firm adhesion of the horny integument.\r\n\r\nDetached bones of this character occur in the Purbeck strata; and\r\nthe first fragments I collected were supposed by me to belong to the\r\nsoft-skinned turtles (_Trionyces_); but the subsequent discovery of\r\nperfect scutes demonstrated their analogy to the dermal bones of the\r\nGavial, and enabled me to determine their true character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 207.

Numerous hexagonal and pentagonal\r\nscutes, articulated together by marginal sutures, also entered into the\r\ncomposition of the osseous dermal cuirass of this reptile, which must,\r\ntherefore, have possessed a flexible, yet impenetrable, coat of armour,\r\ncapable of affording protection against the attack of any assailant.\r\n\r\nIn the Oolite, the dermal bones of other slender-nosed Crocodilians\r\n(_Teleosaurus_) are occasionally met with; the outer surfaces of\r\nwhich are marked with small circular distinct pits; these scutes are\r\nthicker and more rectangular than those above described, and slightly\r\noverlapped each other laterally; they have no connecting process. In\r\nanother species one half of the outer surface is smooth, proving that\r\nit was covered to that extent by the adjoining scute.[588]\r\n\r\n[588] A description of the dermal bones of British fossil reptiles is\r\ngiven in Brit.

In\r\n_fig. 1b_, a thin slice of the same, highly magnified, and viewed\r\nby transmitted light, displays medullary canals, with very fine lines\r\nradiating from them. The peculiar character of this organization\r\nconsists in the disposition of the straight bony spicula; an appearance\r\nwhich first attracted my attention when developing the original\r\nspecimen of the Hylæosaurus (see _Geol. S. E._ p. 327), and led to\r\nthe discovery of some perfect examples, which otherwise would have\r\nbeen destroyed. This structure closely resembles that presented by the\r\nligamentous fibres of the _corium_, or skin, and seems to have resulted\r\nfrom an ossified condition of the dermal integument. These bones\r\nvary from half an inch to three or four inches in diameter, and were\r\ndisposed in one or more longitudinal series on each side the spine,\r\ndiminishing in size as they approach the end of the tail.\r\n\r\nDermal Spines of Hylæosaurus. _Lign. 208, fig. 4._--With the dermal\r\nbones above described there are associated in the first discovered\r\nspecimen of the Hylæosaurus, flat, thin, angular, osseous plates, from\r\nthree to seventeen inches in length; one of which is figured _Lign_\r\n208, fig. 4_. The manner in which they are imbedded in the rocks, in\r\nconnexion with other parts of the skeleton, is shown Wond. pl. iv.\r\nand _Geol. S. E._ pl. v. These very remarkable processes appeared to\r\nme to have formed part of a serrated fringe, which extended along the\r\nback of the reptile, analogous to that observable in certain living\r\nlizards (_Wond._ p. 436, _Lign._ 108); and were provisionally described\r\nas such in my first memoir on the Hylæosaurus. This conjecture has\r\nbeen substantiated by subsequent discoveries, and the true nature of\r\nthe large, flat, angular spines, and the conical bones resembling\r\nthe horn-cones of ruminants, which occur in the Wealden, is now\r\nestablished.[589]\r\n\r\n[589] See _Fossils, Brit. Mus._ pp. 298, 320.\r\n\r\nHorn of Iguanodon.--In this category may be placed the nasal tubercle\r\nor horn of a saurian, like that of the Iguana (_Lign. 208, fig.\r\n2_; _Geol. S. E._ pl. iii.), found with the remains of the Iguanodon,\r\nand probably belonging to that colossal reptile (_Wond._ p. 431; and\r\n_Petrif._ p. 298). It is four inches in length and 3.2 inch by 2.1 inch\r\nin diameter at the base, which is of an irregular elliptical form.\r\nSeveral smaller specimens have recently been discovered.\r\n\r\nExamples of dermal scutes and spines, presenting modifications of form\r\nand structure distinct from those above described, have been brought\r\nto me from various localities of the Wealden; but, as in no instance\r\na connexion with other parts of the skeleton could be traced, the\r\nparticular reptiles to which they belonged cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to notice some of the principal genera of Fossil Reptiles,\r\nespecially of those whose remains occur in the British strata; the\r\narrangement of Professor Owen is adopted for the convenience of\r\nreference to the Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1839 and 1841, which should\r\nbe consulted by the student who would acquire a knowledge of this\r\ndepartment of Palæontology. The subject will be considered under the\r\nfollowing heads; namely:--\r\n\r\n     I. _Enaliosaurians_, or Marine Reptiles; Ichthyosaurus and\r\n        Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\n    II. _Crocodilians_; Crocodile, Teleosaur, &c.\r\n\r\n   III. _Deinosaurians_; comprising the Iguanodon, Megalosaurus,\r\n        Hylæosaurus, Pelorosaurus, &c.\r\n\r\n    IV. _Lacertians_; including the Mosasaurus, Rhyncosaurus, &c.\r\n\r\n     V. _Pterosaurians_; the Pterodactyles, or flying Reptiles.\r\n\r\n    VI. _Chelonians_; or Tortoises and Turtles.\r\n\r\n   VII. _Ophidians_; or Serpents.\r\n\r\n  VIII. _Batrachians_; or the Frog tribe; comprising the Labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Enaliosaurians.--The extinct marine reptiles comprised in this\r\norder constitute two genera, which are characterized by essential\r\nmodifications of osteological structure; they are named Ichthyosaurus\r\n(_fish-lizard_), and Plesiosaurus (_akin to a lizard_). The general\r\nappearance of these beings is so well known, from the splendid\r\ncollection of their fossil remains in the British Museum, and the\r\nnumerous specimens in provincial and private collections, and by\r\nvarious works, both scientific and popular, in which their structure\r\nand physiological relations are fully elucidated, that they must be\r\nfamiliar to every reader.[590]\r\n\r\n[590] _Bd._ vols. i. and ii. contain an admirable exposition of\r\ntheir habits and organization; and Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1839, 1841,\r\nelaborate osteological investigations of both genera. A folio volume on\r\nthese extinct Reptiles, with splendid lithographs, by Thomas Hawkins,\r\nEsq., cannot fail to delight the reader by its graphic descriptions and\r\nbeautiful illustrations. See also the masterly paper on the Ichthyosaur\r\nand the Plesiosaur, by the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, in the Geological\r\nTransactions, 1st series, vol. v. p. 559, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[Side note: ICHTHYOSAURUS. PLESIOSAURUS.]\r\n\r\nThe living Ichthyosaurus must have borne a resemblance to a Grampus or\r\nPorpoise, with four large flippers or paddles and a long tail, having\r\na vertical caudal fin of moderate dimensions; the skin probably being\r\nnaked and smooth, as in the Cetaceans. The Plesiosaurus presented a\r\nconfiguration still more extraordinary (_Wond._ p. 575). With a very\r\nsmall head, it possessed a neck of enormous length, a body of moderate\r\nsize, with four paddles, resembling those of turtles, and a very short\r\ntail. They were both marine, air-breathing, cold-blooded, carnivorous,\r\nvertebrate animals; swarming in prodigious numbers during the secondary\r\nepochs, and particularly in the seas of the Liassic period (_Ly._ p.\r\n277, figs. 310, 311). In both genera the construction of the skeleton\r\npresents many important variations from all known recent types; and\r\nshould be carefully investigated by the student, who will find in the\r\nReports of Professor Owen above referred to all the information that\r\ncan be desired.[591]\r\n\r\n[591] The Penny Cyclopædia, Art. Plesiosaurus, contains an able\r\nabstract of these Reports; and in the _Fossils of the British\r\nMuseum_, the student will find a full account of the discovery of\r\nthe Ichthyosaur and Plesiosaur, and of the deposits in which they\r\nare chiefly found, as well as detailed descriptions of the most\r\ncharacteristic structures of the different species.\r\n\r\nIt will suffice for our present purpose to point out a few important\r\nand obvious characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 209. Eye of Ichthyosaurus. 1/6 _nat._\r\n\r\n_Lias._ _Lyme Regis._\r\n\r\nPortion of the facial part of the skull of an Ichthyosaurus, showing\r\nthe position of the nostril, and of the orbit with its circle of bony\r\nplates, forming the sclerotic coat of the eye.\r\n\r\n_n._ The left nasal aperture.]\r\n\r\nIn the Ichthyosaurus, the nasal apertures or openings of the nostrils\r\nare not towards the snout, as in the Crocodile, but near the anterior\r\nangle of the orbit (see _Lign. 209_), approaching, in this respect,\r\nsome of the recent lizards. The orbit is very large, and the sclerotic\r\ncoat or capsule of the eye has in front an annular series of bony\r\nplates (_Bd._ pl. x. _figs._ 1, 3), which often occur in their natural\r\nposition (_Lign. 209_). This structure is not possessed by fishes,\r\nbut is analogous to that observable in the eyes of turtles, lizards,\r\nand many birds; as for example, in the owl and eagle: it confers on\r\nthe eye additional power of adaptation and intensity of vision. The\r\nmuzzle of the Ichthyosaurus is long and pointed; the lower jaw is\r\nformed of two branches, united anteriorly through nearly half their\r\nlength; each branch is composed of six bones, as in the Crocodile and\r\nLizards, but differently arranged than in those reptiles. The teeth\r\nare very numerous, amounting to nearly two hundred in some species,\r\nand are placed in a single row along the jaws, being implanted in\r\na deep continuous groove (see _Bd._ pl. xi.). These teeth are of a\r\npointed conical form, longitudinally striated, with an expanded base\r\n(_Lign. 210_). The new teeth are developed at the inner side of the\r\nbase of the old, and grow up and displace them (see _Lign. 210_).\r\nThe microscopical structure of the teeth of the Ichthyosaurus is\r\nbeautifully illustrated by Professor Owen (_Odontography_, p. 275, pl.\r\nlxiv.). The tooth consists of a pulp-cavity, surrounded by a body of\r\ndentine, which is invested at the base by a thick layer of cement; and\r\nat the crown by a coat of enamel, also covered by a pellicle of cement\r\n3 the pulp-cavity, in fully-formed teeth, is more or less occupied by\r\ncoarse bone. The chief peculiarity of this structure consists in the\r\ninflection of the cement into vertical folds at the base of the tooth,\r\nby which the marginal portion of the basal dentine is divided into a\r\ncorresponding number of processes; producing, in a transverse section,\r\nthe appearance represented in _Pl. VI. fig. 9_. This organization, as\r\nwe have previously remarked, is similar to that observable in the teeth\r\nof the _Lepidosteus_ (see p. 616), and of the extinct reptile, called\r\n_Labyrinthodon_, hereafter to be noticed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 210.

The annular part is not united to the body of the vertebra, as\r\nin mammals, nor connected by suture, as in Crocodiles, but terminates\r\non each side in a compressed oval base, which fits into corresponding\r\nsockets placed on the boundary line of the spinal depression on the\r\nbody (_Lign. 210, 2a_); thus completing the medullary canal (see\r\n_Bd._ pl. xii. _fig._ D, E.). Hence the collector may easily recognise\r\nthe body of an Ichthyosaurian vertebra, by the pits or depressions on\r\nthe sides of the spinal interspace. The first and second vertebra; are\r\nanchylosed together, and have additional subvertebral, wedge-shaped\r\nbones, which render this part of the column a fixed point of\r\nsupport.[592] (_Bd._ pl. xii. figs. 3, 6.) The form and arrangement of\r\nthe bones that enter into the composition of the pectoral and pelvic\r\narches, and of the paddles, are exemplified in _Bd._ pl. xii.; and\r\nfull osteological details are given in _Brit. Assoc. Rep._ 1839, p.\r\n104. The characters of the several bones composing the pectoral arch\r\nof the Ichthyosaur will be readily understood from the accompanying\r\nillustration. The structure of the pectoral arch of the Plesiosaur is\r\nalso shown in an accompanying Lignograph, for the sake of comparison.\r\nThe bones of a fore-paddle of an Ichthyosaurus are represented (_Lign.\r\n214, fig. 1_). In some species each paddle consists of nearly one\r\nhundred bones. These locomotive extremities are very analogous in their\r\nosteological construction to those of the Cetaceans, but they are\r\nconnected with the trunk by means of the glenoid socket formed by the\r\nscapula and coracoid, which are firmly united to the sternum; whereas\r\nin the Cetaceans the pectoral fin is only attached to a simple scapula,\r\nwhich is merely suspended in the muscles. This structure, together\r\nwith the presence of a clavicle in the Ichthyosaurus (see _Lign.\r\n212_), which is wanting in the Cetaceans,, indicates, in the opinion of\r\nProfessor Owen, that this marine fish-lizard was capable of some degree\r\nof locomotion on the land; and that it might have resorted to the\r\nshore to deposit its eggs, or, like the Crocodile, to sleep. From the\r\nfrequent occurrence of a dislocation or abrupt bend of the vertebral\r\nseries of the tail, at about one-third of its length from the end,\r\nsupposed to have been produced by the weight of a large fin, during\r\nthe progress of decomposition, and from the terminal caudal vertebræ\r\nbeing laterally compressed, it is inferred that the Ichthyosaurus had a\r\nvertical fin at the extremity of the tail, which would thus be rendered\r\na powerful instrument of progressive motion.[593] From the appearance\r\nof the _Coprolites_, which occur abundantly with the skeletons of these\r\nanimals, it is obvious that the intestinal canal in the Ichthyosaurus\r\nwas furnished with spiral valves, as in the Sharks; and the comminuted\r\nbones and scales in the coprolites prove that fishes constituted the\r\nprincipal food of these marine reptiles.\r\n\r\n[592] This structure was first demonstrated by Sir Philip Egerton. See\r\nGeol. Trans. 2d series, vol. v. p. 187, pl. xiv.\r\n\r\n[593] Geol. Trans. 2d ser. vol. v. p. 511, pl. xlii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 214.

A specimen\r\nfound by the late Mr. Channing Pearce renders it probable that the\r\nIchthyosaurus may have been viviparous. A remarkably perfect adult\r\nIchthyosaurus, examined by this gentleman, contained the bones of a\r\nfœtus (a few inches long) _in the cavity of the pelvis_. This specimen\r\nis in the collection of Mr. Pearce, at Bath.

The specimen consists of the phalangeal bones of a\r\nposterior paddle, with the impression of the soft parts or integuments\r\nin their natural position; _a_, marks the termination or distal\r\nextremity of the fin, consisting entirely of the softer integuments;\r\nthese gradually widen and expand to receive the terminal rows of\r\nthe phalangeal ossicles or bones, marked _b_. The upper border of\r\nthis integumentary part of the paddle (_c_) is formed by a smooth,\r\nwell-defined line, apparently a mere duplicature of integument. But\r\nthe lower margin (_d_) exhibits the impressions of a series of rays,\r\nby which the fold of integument was supported; these rays bifurcate\r\nas they approach the margin of the fin, and were probably either\r\ncartilaginous, or composed of an albuminous horny tissue, like the\r\nmarginal rays in the fins of Sharks. Dr. Buckland detected remains of\r\nthe dermal integument of an Ichthyosaurus in a specimen from the Lias\r\nat Barrow-on-Soar (_Bd._ ii. p. 22, pl. x.); and in a fine skeleton\r\nwith the four paddles (now in the British Museum), which I obtained\r\nfrom that locality, there were decided traces of the carbonized\r\ninteguments around each paddle, but which were, unfortunately,\r\nchiselled away, in developing the bones, before I was aware of their\r\ntrue nature.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Coles’s paper, already referred to, the student has an\r\ninstructive instance of the value of a careful examination of faint or\r\nobscure traces of organic matter accompanying these saurian remains,\r\nand how such an examination should be made. The Plate illustrative of\r\nthe Memoir exhibits the minute, hooked, conical bodies, that form the\r\ndense felt-like mass which the black film, frequently accompanying\r\nthese fossil bones, appears to consist of, when seen under the\r\nmicroscope. To what extent this substance entered into the constitution\r\nof the integuments, or of the exact relation of these \"setiform scales\"\r\nto the surface or the interior of the skin, our present knowledge does\r\nnot enable us to judge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLESIOSAURUS.]\r\n\r\nPlesiosaurus. (_Bd._ pl. xvi.--xix.)--The animals of this genus present\r\nin their osteological structure a remarkable deviation from all known\r\nrecent and fossil reptiles; uniting the characters of the head of\r\na lizard, with the teeth of a crocodile, to a neck of inordinate\r\nlength, with such modifications of the ribs, the pectoral and pelvic\r\narches, and the paddles, as to justify the graphic simile of Professor\r\nSedgwick, that the Plesiosaurus might be compared to a serpent threaded\r\nthrough the shell of a turtle.\r\n\r\nThe character which immediately strikes the observer, is the\r\nextraordinary length of the neck, and the relative smallness of the\r\nhead. The neck, which in most animals is formed of but five vertebræ,\r\nand in the extremest recent example, the Swan, does not exceed\r\ntwenty-four, is in the Plesiosaurus composed of from twenty to forty;\r\nand, in some species, is four times the length of the head, and equal\r\nto the entire length of the body and tail; while the length of the\r\nhead (in _P. dolichodeirus_) is less than one-thirteenth of the entire\r\nskeleton. The skull resembles that of the crocodile in its general\r\nform, but is relatively smaller, and is more related to the lacertian\r\ntype. The parietal bone is more triquetal than in the crocodiles;\r\nbut the zygomatic bone is attached to its lower end. The breathing\r\napertures are situated anterior to the orbits, on the highest part of\r\nthe head. The lower jaw has the usual structure of the Saurians; but\r\nthe dentary bone is greatly expanded anteriorly, and united in front\r\n(see _Bd._ pl. xix.). The teeth are implanted in separate sockets, as\r\nin the crocodile, and there are from thirty to forty on each side the\r\njaws. They are conical, slender, long, pointed, slightly recurved,\r\nand longitudinally grooved from the base upwards; having a long round\r\nfang. The pulp-cavity is long and single, surrounded by a body of firm\r\ndentine, covered on the crown with a layer of enamel, and at the base\r\nwith cement (_Odont._ pl. lxxiv.). The dentition in the Plesiosauri\r\ndiffers from that of the Crocodiles, in the successional teeth emerging\r\nthrough distinct apertures on the inner side of the sockets of their\r\npredecessors, and not through the pulp-cavity. The vertebræ are\r\nrelatively longer than in the Ichthyosaurus, and their articular faces\r\nare either flat, or slightly excavated towards the periphery, with a\r\ngentle convexity in the centre (_Foss. Til. For._ pl. ix. fig. 4).[595]\r\n\r\n[595] For details, see Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1839, p. 50.\r\n\r\nThe caudal vertebræ have two distinct hæmapophyses, not united into a\r\nchevron-bone.\r\n\r\nThe cervical ribs, or hatchet-bones, are attached by two articular\r\nfacets to the bodies of the vertebræ, but with a very narrow space\r\nbetween; scarcely large enough even for the passage of the sympathetic\r\nnerve; and apparently not sufficient for the vertebral artery.\r\n\r\nThe _pectoral arch_ is remarkable for the pair of elongated and broad\r\ncoracoid bones (_Bd._ pl. xvii. and _Lign. 213_); indeed the coracoids\r\nattain their maximum of development in the Plesiosaurus. The _ribs_,\r\nwhich are very numerous, and extend throughout a great portion of\r\nthe vertebral column, are connected, anteriorly, in the abdominal\r\nregion, by several slender bones, called _costal-arcs_, consisting\r\nof six or seven pieces to each pair of ribs; the Ichthyosaurus has a\r\nsimilar structure, but the arcs are composed of but five pieces. As\r\nthese connecting bones are so constructed as to admit of a certain\r\ndegree of gliding motion upon each other, it is inferred that, by this\r\nmechanism, considerable expansion of the pulmonary cavities in these\r\nair-breathing marine reptiles was obtained (_Bd._ pl. xviii. fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThe paddles are composed of fewer and more slender bones than in the\r\nIchthyosaurus, and must have been of a more elegant form, and possessed\r\ngreater flexibility (_Lign. 214, fig. 2_). The wrist (_carpus_)\r\nconsists of a double row of round ossicles, which are succeeded\r\nby five elongated metacarpal, and these by numerous, slender and\r\nslightly-curved phalangeal bones.\r\n\r\nSixteen species of Plesiosaurus and ten of Ichthyosaurus have been\r\ndiscovered in the British strata, and nearly forty are now known;\r\ntheir geological range is from the Lias to the Chalk, inclusive.[596]\r\nTheir remains are found most abundantly in the Lias and Oolite. I have\r\ncollected many Plesiosaurian vertebræ in the Wealden, and in the Green\r\nSand of Farringdon. No traces of Ichthyosauri have been observed in the\r\nWealden; but vertebræ, and jaws with teeth, occur in the lower Chalk\r\nand Galt of Kent and Cambridgeshire.[597] On the Continent the remains\r\nof Enaliosaurians have also been discovered in the same formations.\r\n\r\n[596] See _Petrifactions_, for an account of the specimens in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n[597] Brit. Assoc. Trans. 1845, Sect. p. 60. The Enaliosaurian bones\r\nand teeth found in the Cretaceous deposits of England have been\r\nfully described and illustrated by Prof. Owen, in Dixon’s _Fossils\r\nof Sussex_, &c., and in his Monograph on the Fossil Reptiles of the\r\nCretaceous Formation, Palæontographical Society, 1851.\r\n\r\nPliosaurus.---This name designates a gigantic extinct reptile, of\r\nwhich the upper and lower jaws, with teeth, considerable portions of\r\nthe vertebral column, and many bones of the extremities have been\r\ndiscovered in the Kimmeridge clay of Oxfordshire, and are preserved in\r\nDr. Buckland’s museum. The teeth resemble those of the Plesiosaurus\r\nin their general aspect, being of a conical form, longitudinally\r\ngrooved, and having a long fang; but they are readily distinguished by\r\nthe subtrihedral form of the crown, produced by the smooth, flat, or\r\nslightly convex external surface; they approach in this respect the\r\ntooth of the Mosasaurus; from the latter, however, even fragments may\r\nbe known by the presence of longitudinal ridges. The animal itself was\r\nan enormous marine reptile, allied to the Plesiosaurians, but more\r\nnearly related to the Crocodilians.[598]\r\n\r\n[598] Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 60. Odont. pl. lxviii.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Crocodilians.--The loricated, or mailed, Saurian reptiles, viz.\r\nthe Alligators, Crocodiles, and Gavials, are well known as the largest\r\nliving forms of cold-blooded oviparous quadrupeds.[599] No relics of\r\nany recent species have been observed in a fossil state; except that of\r\nthe Gangetic Gavial, which has been found fossil in the Sub-Himalayas\r\nby Capt. Cantley and Dr. Falconer; but remains of Crocodilians of\r\nthe existing generic type, having the spinal column composed of\r\nconcavo-convex vertebra; (i. e. united to each other by a ball and\r\nsocket-joint), the convexity being behind, or towards the tail, have\r\nbeen found in the London Clay at Hackney and the Isle of Sheppey, and\r\nin the eocene deposits on the coast of Western Sussex and Hants.[600]\r\nBut the Crocodiles of the Wealden, Purbeck, Oolite, and Lias differ\r\nmaterially in their osteological characters from the recent species,\r\nparticularly in the structure of the vertebral column; which in one\r\ngenus is composed of concavo-convex vertebra; placed in a reversed\r\nposition to those of the existing species, the ball or convexity\r\nbeing anterior, or directed forwards. In the other genera, both the\r\narticular faces of the vertebræ are either flat, or concave.[601]\r\n(_Geol. S. E._ p. 296.)\r\n\r\n[599] A detailed and philosophical examination of the osteology of\r\nthe recent Crocodilia has lately been given to the scientific world\r\nby Prof. Owen, in his Monograph on the Reptilia of the London Clay,\r\npublished by the Palæontographical Society of London, 1850.

The fossil Crocodiles of the latter type are arranged in two\r\ngenera; namely, Teleosaurus[604] (_Lign. 216, fig. 3_), in which\r\nthe nasal apertures terminate in two orifices, (not blended into a\r\nsingle opening as in the recent species,) in front of the nose; and\r\nSteneosaurus (_Lign. 216, fig. 2_), in which the breathing canals end\r\nin two nearly semicircular vertical openings at the extremity of the\r\nmuzzle.

VI. fig. 7_). The sides of the crown are marked with a\r\nfew longitudinal grooves. Some biconcave vertebræ found in the same\r\nquarries, and characterized by the compressed wedge-shaped form of the\r\ncentre (_Foss. Til. For._ pl. ix. _fig._ 11), are supposed by Professor\r\nOwen to belong to the same reptile as the teeth above described; but it\r\nis hazardous to pronounce on the identity of these detached teeth and\r\nbones, without more corroborative proof than has hitherto been obtained.\r\n\r\n[607] Foss.

(_Goniopholis crassidens._) _Petrif._ p. 170,\r\n_Lign. 38._--Under this name, the second species of Crocodilian teeth\r\nwill be considered; the discovery of a considerable portion of a\r\nskeleton of a reptile with teeth of this form (_Wond._ p. 416), in\r\na quarry near Swanage, having disclosed some of the most important\r\nosteological characters of the original. These teeth are distinguished\r\nfrom the former by their cylindrical base, and rounded, obtuse, conical\r\ncrowns (_Petrif._ p. 171): they somewhat resemble in form those\r\nof the Crocodile, but the crown is strongly marked with numerous,\r\nwell-defined, longitudinal grooves and ridges; and there is a sharp\r\nridge on the middle of each side. A small specimen, broken off at the\r\nbase, is represented _Pl. VI. fig. 5_; it shows the smooth cylindrical\r\nbase of the tooth, which is covered with cement, and the finely\r\nstriated enamelled crown; some of the teeth are more than two inches\r\nin length, and one inch in diameter at the base (_Foss. Til For._ pl.\r\nv. figs. 1, 2). I have found these teeth in numerous localities; they\r\nare always well preserved, with the ridges sharp, and have a high\r\npolish (_Geol. I. Wight_, p. 357, _Lign._ 30); a series of successional\r\nteeth may often be detected in the pulp-cavity (see _Wond._ p. 414).\r\nThe detached teeth, and fragments of dermal bones (_Lign. 207_),\r\nwhich, from their constant occurrence with this species, I had been\r\nled to consider as belonging to the same reptile, were the only\r\nrelics that had come under my observation, until the discovery of the\r\nSwanage specimen above mentioned.[609] On the two corresponding slabs\r\ncontaining this fine fossil are imbedded many detached teeth; a portion\r\nof the left side of the lower jaw, with two teeth in place; ribs and\r\nnumerous vertebræ, which are biconcave, and have an irregular medullary\r\ncavity in the centre of the body; chevron bones resembling those of\r\nthe Crocodile; the bones of the pelvic arch, and some of those of the\r\nextremities. With these are the remains of the osseous dermal cuirass,\r\nconsisting of numerous scutes (figured and described p. 657, _Lign.\r\n207_), scattered at random among the other relics of the skeleton; some\r\nhaving the inner, and others the external surface exposed; several of\r\nthese bones are perfect, and exceed six inches in length, and two and\r\na half in breadth. Numerous scales of a small Ganoid fish (_Lepidotus\r\nminor_), common in the Purbeck strata, are also intermingled with these\r\nremains. This reptile is named _Goniopholis crassidens_, by Professor\r\nOwen.[610]\r\n\r\n[609] Now in the British Museum: see _Petrif._ p. 170. A lithograph\r\nof one of the slabs was given in the third edition of the Wonders of\r\nGeology, 1839.\r\n\r\n[610] _Gonio-pholis_:--_angle-scute_. Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 72.\r\nBoth the slabs of the Swanage specimen are admirably arranged in the\r\nsame case in the British Museum, with bones and scutes of this reptile\r\nfrom Tilgate Forest; there can be no doubt that the entire lower jaw\r\nof the Swanage reptile might have been obtained if the quarry-men had\r\ntaken the precaution of examining the adjoining block of stone.\r\n\r\nPœcilopleuron.--The remains of an allied genus of Crocodile, the\r\n_Pœcilopleuron Bucklandi_ (of Deslongchamps), occur in the Oolite,\r\nnear Caen, Normandy. This reptile, like the Goniopholis, had biconcave\r\nvertebræ, with a large medullary cavity in the middle of the centrum.\r\nThe body of the vertebræ is contracted in the middle, the neural arch\r\nanchylosed, with no trace of suture, and with a thin spinous process,\r\nwhich is remarkable for its backward inclination. Vertebræ of this\r\ncharacter also occur in the Wealden strata of Tilgate Forest and the\r\nIsle of Wight.[611]\r\n\r\n[611] Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 84. _Foss. Til. For._ pl. ix. fig. 8,\r\nrepresents a caudal vertebra.\r\n\r\nTeleosaurus. (_Bd._ pl. xxv.)--In the Oolite of England and the\r\nContinent, the remains of a genus of extinct reptiles, having, like\r\nthe recent Gavial, long slender muzzles, have been discovered in\r\nseveral localities. These fossils consist of the osseous scutes of\r\nan imbricated dermal cuirass; of the cranium and jaws with teeth; of\r\nthe vertebral column; and many other bones. The characters of the\r\ndermal scutes, and of the muzzle with its terminal nasal apertures,\r\nhave already been described (p. 659, and p. 676). There are several\r\nspecies of _Teleosaurus_; a splendid specimen of _T. Chapmanni_,\r\nfifteen feet long, from the Lias-shale on the Yorkshire coast, is\r\npreserved in the Whitby Museum; and there are interesting examples\r\nin the British Museum.[612] Teleosaurian remains have been found in\r\nthe Oolite at Stonesfield, and at Deddington, Oxfordshire; and Mr. C.\r\nMoore, of Ilminster, whose museum is rich with perfect Ichthyosaurs\r\nand Fishes from the Upper Lias of the neighbourhood, has been highly\r\nsuccessful in developing some charming specimens of small Teleosaurs\r\nfrom out of the same deposit. In the Oolite of Caen, in Normandy, very\r\nfine specimens of _T. Cadomensis_ have been discovered; and from these\r\nthe illustrious Cuvier first determined the character and affinities\r\nof the original.[613] The British Oolite contains also the relics of a\r\nreptile with biconcave vertebræ, belonging to the genus _Steneosaurus_:\r\nthe cranium with the jaws and teeth have been found in Kimmeridge clay,\r\nat Shotover (_Bd._ pl. xxv.).[614]\r\n\r\n[612] _Petrifactions_, p. 178.\r\n\r\n[613] Oss. Foss. tom. v. p. 127.\r\n\r\n[614] Report Brit. Assoc. 1841, p. 82.\r\n\r\nFrom the Jura limestone at Monheim, in Franconia, the remains of a\r\nsmall Crocodilian reptile (Teleosaurus priscus), with a long slender\r\nmuzzle, have been obtained. In a specimen[615] from the former\r\nlocality, the skull, jaws with teeth, the entire vertebral column, and\r\nmany parts of the skeleton are preserved: the entire length is but\r\nthree feet.\r\n\r\n[615] Now in the British Museum: see _Petrif._ p. 178, where a detailed\r\ndescription of this unique fossil is given. See also _Ossem. Foss._\r\ntom. v. pl. vi.\r\n\r\nStreptospondylus, _Lign. 206, figs. 5, 7._--Baron Cuvier in his\r\ncelebrated work, \"_Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_,\" has given\r\nan elaborate description of the remains of two kinds of slender-nosed\r\nCrocodilians, from the Kimmeridge clay of Honfleur, and the Oxford clay\r\nof Havre.\r\n\r\nThe specimens consist of the jaws with teeth, vertebræ, and some bones\r\nof the extremities.[616] In one species, the vertebræ are biconcave; in\r\nthe other, they are convexo-concave, and present a remarkable deviation\r\nfrom the recent Crocodilian type, namely, that they are placed in a\r\nreversed position,--the convex face of the vertebra being directed\r\nanteriorly, or towards the cranium, and the concavity posteriorly;\r\nthe name of the genus, _Streptospondylus_ (reversed-spine), denotes\r\nthis peculiarity of structure. The bodies of three or four large\r\nconvexo-concave cervical vertebræ, were discovered in the Tilgate\r\nstrata many years since, and are described in my various works (_Geol.\r\nS. E._ p. 300); but no suspicion was then entertained of their\r\nbelonging to this genus, although I had repeatedly compared them with\r\nthe figures of the Honfleur crocodile,[617] the imperfect state of\r\nthe processes obscuring their true characters. Professor Owen first\r\ndetected the true character of these Wealden vertebræ, in a large\r\ncervical, six inches long (now in the British Museum), in which two\r\noblique processes are preserved on the concave end of the bone, their\r\nflat, oblong, articular faces, are directed downwards and outwards,--a\r\ncharacter which at once proves them to be the posterior pair, for the\r\nanterior oblique processes would be directed upwards and inwards.[618]\r\nVertebræ of the same species occur in the Wealden of the Isle of Wight;\r\nand of another species in the Oolite at Chipping Norton, and in the\r\nLias of Whitby.\r\n\r\n[616] Oss. Foss. tom. v. p. 143, pl. viii. ix.\r\n\r\n[617] Reduced figures of two of these vertebræ are given in _Lign.\r\n206_, _figs._ 5 and 7, p. 653.\r\n\r\n[618] Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 92. The position of the articulating\r\nsurfaces of the oblique processes (_zygapophyses_) in more perfect\r\nspecimens, subsequently discovered in various localities of the\r\nWealden, established the existence not only of a saurian allied to the\r\nStreptospondylus, but also of other reptiles whose spinal column was\r\nwholly or in part made up of vertebræ which were convex in front and\r\nconcave behind, as in the cervicals and anterior dorsals of certain\r\nmammalia. Some of these fossil vertebræ Dr. Melville has referred,\r\nwith great probability, to the cervical region of the Iguanodon (see\r\n_Petrif._ p. 259); others cannot at present be satisfactorily assigned\r\nto any known genus of reptiles.\r\n\r\nA concavo-convex caudal vertebra, with the relations of which I am\r\nunacquainted, was found in the same quarry in Tilgate Forest; a reduced\r\noutline of this unique fossil is given in _Lign. 206, fig. 1_. The\r\ncentrum is of a sub-cylindrical form, and the articular face in front\r\nis concave, and that behind, convex; with a chevron-bone that is\r\nanchylosed to the body of the vertebra, as in some of the caudals of\r\nthe Mosasaurus, and terminates in an inferior spine (_f._); the pair\r\nof anterior oblique processes remains; the neural spinous process is\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nCetiosaurus.--From a considerable number of vertebæ and bones of\r\nthe extremities of some gigantic aquatic reptiles, discovered in\r\nthe Oolite in various places in Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and\r\nYorkshire, the present genus was established; the name being intended\r\nto indicate a distant general resemblance of these extinct Saurians to\r\nthe Cetaceans.[619] The vertebra; differ from those of the Iguanodon\r\nin having their articular faces of a sub-circular form, and the body\r\nrelatively short; the anterior face is nearly flat, and the posterior\r\nconcave, in the dorsal vertebra;; but in the caudal both faces are\r\nconcave, and have a well-defined elevated margin, which gives the\r\nbody a deeply excavated character, easily recognizable. Vertebræ of\r\nthis kind were among my earliest discoveries in the strata of Tilgate\r\nForest. (_Geol. S. E._ p. 282.) Some specimens are eight inches in the\r\ntransverse diameter of the articular face, and but four and a half\r\ninches in the antero-posterior length of the body.[620] The original\r\nanimals are supposed to have been of aquatic, and probably of marine\r\nhabits, on the evidence of the sub-biconcave structure of the vertebræ\r\nand of the coarse cancellous tissue of the long bones, which are\r\ndestitute of a medullary cavity. They must have rivalled the modern\r\nwhales in bulk, for some specimens indicate a length of forty or fifty\r\nfeet; they are supposed to have had web-feet, and a broad vertical\r\ntail.[621]\r\n\r\n[619] Proc. Geol. Soc. vol. iii. p. 457.\r\n\r\n[620] The osteological characters of these remains, and the\r\nphysiological relations of the original animals, are described in\r\n_Brit. Assoc.

Rep. 1841, p. 102.\r\n\r\nPolyptychodon.[622]--The remains of another gigantic marine Saurian\r\nhave been discovered in the Green Sand at Hythe, in Kent; they consist\r\nchiefly of the bones of the pelvis and hinder extremities.[623] The\r\nfemur must have been nearly four feet in length. The long bones have a\r\ncancellated structure, without a medullary cavity 3 the outer surface\r\nis finely striated. Probably in a recent state the cells were filled\r\nwith oil, as in the _Cetacea_. Neither the vertebræ nor the teeth of\r\nthis reptile are known; but, provisionally, these remains have been\r\nreferred to the same animal as that to which the large, conical,\r\nlongitudinally ridged teeth belonged, which have been found in the\r\nKentish Rag, at Maidstone, and in the Chalk of Sussex, and have been\r\nnamed _Polyptychodon continuus_.[624] Teeth of _P. interruptus_ are\r\nnot unfrequent in the Cretaceous series; and a portion of the lower\r\njaw of this species, from the Chalk of Kent, is in Mr. Toulmin Smith’s\r\ncollection.[625]\r\n\r\n[622] _Poly-ptych-odon_; many-wrinkle-tooth.\r\n\r\n[623] _Geol.

Deinosaurians.--The Order Deinosauria (_fearfully-great lizards_)\r\nhas been established for the reception of those extinct colossal\r\nreptiles, comprising the _Megalosaurus_, _Hylæosaurus_, _Iguanodon_,\r\nand _Pelorosaurus_, which, in their organization, present the\r\ntransition from the Crocodilians to the Lacertians, and whose essential\r\nosteological characters Professor Owen has described as follow:--\r\n\r\n \"This group, which includes at least three well-established genera\r\n of Saurians, is characterized by a large sacrum, composed of five\r\n anchylosed vertebræ of unusual construction; by the height, breadth,\r\n and outward sculpture of the neural arch of the dorsal vertebræ; by\r\n the two-fold articulation of the ribs to the vertebra:, viz. at the\r\n anterior part of the spine by a head and tubercle, and along the rest\r\n of the trunk by a tubercle attached to the transverse process only;\r\n by broad, and sometimes complicated, coracoids, and long and slender\r\n clavicles; whereby Crocodilian characters of the vertebral column\r\n are combined with a Lacertian type of the pectoral arch. The dental\r\n organs also exhibit the same transitional or annectent characters,\r\n in a greater or lesser degree. The bones of the extremities are of\r\n large proportional size for Saurians; they are provided with large\r\n medullary cavities, and with well developed and unusual processes, and\r\n are terminated by metacarpal, metatarsal, and phalangeal bones, which,\r\n with the exception of the ungual phalanges, more or less resemble\r\n those of the heavy pachydermal Mammals, and attest, with the hollow\r\n long-bones, the terrestrial habits of the species.\r\n\r\n \"The combinations of such characters, some, as the sacral ones,\r\n altogether peculiar among Reptiles, others borrowed, as it were, from\r\n groups now distinct from each other, and all manifested by creatures\r\n far surpassing in size the largest of existing reptiles, will, it is\r\n presumed, be deemed sufficient ground for establishing a distinct\r\n tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles, for which I would propose the\r\n name of Dinosauria.\r\n\r\n \"Of this tribe the principal and best established genera are\r\n the _Megalosaurus_, the _Hylæosaurus_, and the _Iguanodon_; the\r\n gigantic Crocodile-lizards of the dry land; the peculiarities of\r\n the osteological structure of which distinguish them as clearly\r\n from the modern terrestrial and amphibious Sauria, as the opposite\r\n modifications for an aquatic life characterize the extinct\r\n _Enaliosauria_, or Marine Lizards.\"[626]\r\n\r\n[626] Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 103.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate investigation of the fossil remains of these stupendous\r\nbeings, and the luminous exposition of their organization and\r\nphysiological relations, embodied in the report to which the above\r\nextract is introductory, are among the most important contributions\r\nto Palæontology, and afford a striking example of the successful\r\napplication of profound anatomical knowledge to the elucidation of the\r\nmost marvellous epoch in the earth’s physical history, the _Age of\r\nReptiles_.\r\n\r\nFrom the great size of the bones of these reptiles, their remains have\r\nexcited the curiosity even of the common observer; and although an\r\nexaggerated idea has been generally entertained of the magnitude of the\r\noriginal animals, yet, even when reduced to their natural proportions\r\nby the rigorous formula of the anatomist, applied to the accumulated\r\nrelics which years of laborious research have exhumed from their\r\nrocky sepulchres and deposited in our museums, their dimensions are\r\nsufficiently stupendous to satisfy the most enthusiastic lover of the\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nLet the reader visit the British Museum,[627] and after examining the\r\nlargest thigh-bone of the Iguanodon, repair to the zoological gallery,\r\nand inspect the recent Crocodilian reptiles, some twenty-five or\r\nthirty feet in length; and observe that the fossil _bone_ equals, if\r\nnot surpasses, in size, the entire _thigh_ of the largest of existing\r\nreptiles; then let him imagine this bone clothed with proportionate\r\nmuscles and integuments, and reflect upon the enormous trunk which\r\nsuch limbs must have been destined to move and to sustain--and he will\r\nobtain a just notion of the appalling magnitude of the lizards which\r\ninhabited the country of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\n[627] See Fossils of the British Museum, p. 227.\r\n\r\nThe general characters of the extinct reptiles comprised in the order\r\n_Deinosauria_[628] must be known to the intelligent reader, from the\r\nvarious popular notices which have from time to time appeared; and\r\ntheir names have become as familiar as household words. I shall here\r\nrestrict myself to a few general remarks on the form and structure of\r\nthe teeth, and of some of the more important bones of the best known\r\nspecies of these great reptiles.[629]\r\n\r\n[628] In the new edition of Pictet’s _Paléontologie_ (now in course of\r\npublication), two 4to. plates (xxiii. and xxiv.) are devoted to the\r\nillustration of the remains of these colossal reptiles.\r\n\r\n[629] For further account of the Iguanodon, see _Petrif._ p. 224, &c.;\r\nof the Hylæosaurus, _ibid._ p. 314, &c.; of the Pelorosaurus, _ibid._\r\np. 330, &c.; of the Regnosaurus, _ibid._ p. 333, &c.; and of the\r\nMegalosaurus, _ibid._ p. 328, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 218.

Geol. Soc._\r\n_sec. ser._ vol. i.), illustrated by figures of the teeth in a portion\r\nof the lower jaw, the sacrum, femur, and other bones. The remains of\r\nthis reptile are also frequently discovered in the Wealden (see _Foss.\r\nTil. For._ p. 67, pl. ix. figs. 2, 6). The most important relic of this\r\ngreat carnivorous terrestrial lizard is a portion of the right ramus of\r\nthe lower jaw, containing one perfect tooth, and the germs of several\r\nteeth (_Lign. 218_). The tooth of the Megalosaurus, (_Lign. 219_, and\r\n_Pl. VI. fig. 7_,) has a conical, laterally compressed crown, with\r\nthe point recurved like a sabre, and the edges trenchant and finely\r\nserrated. The implantation of the teeth is very peculiar, and exhibits\r\nthe dentition of the Crocodilians blended with that of the Lacertians.\r\nThe jaw has an outer parapet, as in the true lizards (see _Lign. 205_),\r\nbut the teeth are fixed in distinct sockets, formed by transverse\r\npartitions, that are attached to a mesial (_inner_) parapet, composed\r\nof a series of triangular osseous plates; the bases of the old teeth,\r\nand the germs of the new ones, being thus enclosed and concealed.\r\nThe tooth is formed of a central body of dentine, the crown having a\r\ncoating enamel; and the whole an external investment of cement, which\r\nforms a thicker layer around the fang; the pulp-cavity is occupied by\r\ncoarse bone, in the adult tooth. The microscopical examination shows\r\nthe dentine to consist of very fine calcigerous tubes, 1/28000th of an\r\ninch in diameter, without any admixture of medullary canals, radiating\r\nfrom the pulp-cavity at right angles with the external surface of the\r\ntooth, and sending; off numerous secondary branches; these ultimately\r\ndilate into, or inosculate with, a stratum of calcigerous cells\r\nthat separates the dentine from the enamel.[630] A thin slice of a\r\nvertical section, viewed by transmitted light, is represented _Pl. VI.\r\nfig. 7 b_; showing the calcigerous tubes radiating from the centre,\r\nand terminating in the stratum of cells; this cellular structure is\r\ninvested with a layer of enamel, and the latter with an external coat\r\nof cement, indicated by the dark outline.[631]\r\n\r\n[630] Owen’s _Odontography_, p. 271, which should be consulted for more\r\nminute details.\r\n\r\n[631] To fully comprehend the minute structure of these and the other\r\nteeth figured in _Pl. VI._ Professor Owen’s plates should be examined;\r\nthe small scale necessarily adopted in the present work rendering it\r\nimpossible to do justice to the subject.\r\n\r\nFour specimens of the sacrum, composed of five anchylosed vertebral\r\n(_Foss. Til. For._ pl. xix. _fig._ 12), have been discovered; one of\r\nthese is from Tilgate Forest. The femur of the Megalosaurus has two\r\nlarge rounded trochanters of nearly equal size, below the head of the\r\nbone; its shaft is sub-cylindrical, and slightly bowed.\r\n\r\nThis colossal carnivorous Saurian, whose length is estimated at thirty\r\nfeet, appears to have been terrestrial, and an inhabitant of the same\r\n_terra incognita_ as the Iguanodon; it probably preyed on the smaller\r\nreptiles, and the young of the Iguanodon, Crocodilians, &c.\r\n\r\nHylæosaurus (_Wealden lizard_) Owenii. _Wond._ pl. iv. and p. 435;\r\n_Geol. S. E._ pl. v.--In the summer of 1832, I obtained the interesting\r\nspecimen which first demonstrated the existence of the remains of\r\nanother extraordinary modification of Saurian organization in the\r\nWealden. The circumstances which led to this discovery afford an\r\ninstructive lesson to the young collector.\r\n\r\n Upon visiting a quarry in Tilgate Forest, which had yielded many\r\n organic remains, I perceived in some fragments of a large mass of\r\n stone, which had recently been broken up and thrown on the road-side,\r\n traces of numerous pieces of bone. I therefore collected all the\r\n recognisable portions of the block, and had them conveyed to my\r\n residence. The first step was to cement together those pieces that\r\n would admit of juxtaposition, and these were at length united into a\r\n block of stone five feet long, three wide, and about one foot thick.\r\n This was firmly fixed in a stout frame, to prevent the separation of\r\n the united portions during the process of chiselling. Guided by the\r\n indications which the sections visible on the edge afforded, a thin\r\n iron wedge was carefully driven in, about half an inch above the\r\n uppermost layer of bones, and a large slab was flaked off; the three\r\n dermal spines (_Wond._ pl. iv. 5) in the middle of the specimen were\r\n thus exposed, and shivered to pieces; some fragments adhered to the\r\n mass broken off, others to the block, and many were detached; every\r\n piece, however small, was collected, and those adhering to the slab\r\n were chiselled out; and the whole were then carefully replaced and\r\n cemented to the bones that remained imbedded in the large block.\r\n After an interval of some days, to allow of the firm cohesion of the\r\n cemented parts, the task was resumed, and the stone chiselled away,\r\n until some portion of the large bones of the pectoral arch (_Wond._\r\n pl. iv. 7) were observed. The specimen was at length brought to the\r\n state in which it now appears (in the British Museum[632]); but\r\n during the progress of its development, which occupied many weeks,\r\n it was repeatedly necessary to suspend the work, and unite displaced\r\n fragments of bone, and resume the task after their consolidation. The\r\n plate in the _Geol. S. E._ conveys a good idea of the original.\r\n\r\n[632] See _Fossils, Brit. Mus._ p. 139, &c.\r\n\r\nThe specimen consists of a part of the spinal column, composed of seven\r\ndorsal and three or four cervical vertebræ, almost in their natural\r\njuxtaposition, with obscure indications of a part of the base of the\r\nskull; eleven ribs; the bones of the pectoral arch (two _coracoids_\r\nand two _scapulæ_); with numerous dermal bones and spines. A second\r\nspecimen of this reptile was found near Bolney, in Sussex; and like\r\nthe former, it was, unfortunately, almost wholly destroyed by the\r\nlabourers; but I obtained many bones, some of which are perfect, and\r\nindicate an animal of considerable magnitude: a _scapula_, nineteen\r\ninches long, an arm-bone or _humerus_, numerous ribs, bones of the\r\nphalanges, &c. A fine series of twenty-six caudal vertebra, having\r\na total length of nearly six feet, with chevron bones and dermal\r\nspines, was discovered in 1837, in Tilgate Forest.[633] A few detached\r\nbones are the only other relics of this reptile that have come under\r\nmy observation.[634] The osteological characters presented by these\r\nremains afford another example of tire blending of the Crocodilian with\r\nthe Lacertian type of structure; for we have in the pectoral arch the\r\nscapula or omoplate of a crocodile associated with the coracoid of a\r\nlizard. Another remarkable feature in these fossils is the presence of\r\nthe large angular bones or spines (described p. 660, figured _Lign.\r\n208_), which, there is reason to infer, constituted a serrated crest\r\nalong the middle of the back: and the numerous small oval dermal bones,\r\nwhich appear to have been arranged in longitudinal series along each\r\nside of the dorsal fringe. (_Geol. S. E._ p. 323.)\r\n\r\n[633] See _Fossils, Brit. Mus._ p. 323.\r\n\r\n[634] See \"Memoir on the Remains of the Iguanodon, Hylæosaurus, and\r\nother Saurian Reptiles,\" by the Author, in _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nfor 1841, Part II.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ, ribs, and other parts of the skeleton found in\r\nthese specimens also present modifications of structure of great\r\ninterest.[635] No specimens of teeth have been found associated with\r\nthe remains of the Hylæosaurus, in such manner as to afford unequivocal\r\nproof of their belonging to that animal. But in the same quarries,\r\nteeth, decidedly of the Lacertian structure, are occasionally found,\r\nand may with some probability be referred to that reptile. These teeth\r\n(see _Pl. VI. fig. 6^a_.) are about 1-1/4 inch in length, and commence\r\nat the base with a cylindrical shank, which gradually enlarges into a\r\ncrown of an obtuse lanceolate form, convex in front, hollowed behind,\r\nand terminating in a rounded obtusely angular apex, the margins of\r\nwhich are generally more or less worn.[636] The crown is solid, but\r\nthe fang encloses a small pulp-cavity; the surface is enamelled, and\r\ncovered with very fine longitudinal striæ; the base in every specimen\r\nappears broken transversely, as if it had been anchylosed to the jaw,\r\nor to the base of a socket. The fang never presents an appearance of\r\nlateral adhesion, as if belonging to a Pleurodont lizard. Sections of\r\nthese teeth expose a simple, central, medullary canal, the upper part\r\nof which is generally filled with the ossified remains of the pulp; and\r\nthis is surrounded by a body of firm dentine, with extremely minute\r\ncalcigerous tubes radiating from the centre to the periphery of the\r\ntooth, which is invested with a relatively thick coat of enamel, in\r\nwhich no structure is apparent. _Pl. VI. fig. 6^b_ represents a small\r\nportion of a vertical slice, highly magnified and viewed by transmitted\r\nlight. The reference of these dental organs to the Hylæosaurus must\r\nnot, however, be considered as conclusive, until confirmed by the\r\ndiscovery of the teeth attached to the jaw, in connexion with other\r\nparts of the skeleton. The locomotive organs of the Hylæosaurus are\r\nbut imperfectly known; a perfect humerus, one phalangeal bone, and\r\nfragments of the fibula (the small bone of the leg) are the only bones\r\nhitherto observed. The length of this reptile, which was probably\r\nterrestrial and herbivorous, may be estimated at from twenty to thirty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[635] See Report, Brit. Assoc. 1841, pp. 111-120. Phil.

From the resemblance of the perfect teeth to those of the Iguana\r\n(_Lign. 205_, p. 649), a land lizard of the West Indies, I proposed the\r\nname of _Iguanodon_ (signifying an animal with teeth like those of the\r\nIguana) for the extinct reptile to which they belonged. The numerous\r\nbones and teeth subsequently exhumed from the strata of Tilgate Forest\r\nand other localities in the Wealden of Sussex and of the Isle of\r\nWight, and the considerable portion of the skeleton of an individual\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Bensted in the Kentish Rag, have supplied the data\r\nupon which our present knowledge of the characters of the original is\r\nbased.\r\n\r\n[637] These are described in _Foss. South D._ 1822, p. 54, under the\r\nhead \"_Teeth and bones of unknown animals_.\" This was the earliest\r\npublished notice of the fossils of the Wealden; it contains also a\r\ndescription of a tooth of the Megalosaurus (p. 55, No. 42).\r\n\r\nIn Wond, pp. 422-435, a brief account will be found of the character\r\nof the teeth, horn, femur, vertebræ, &c., and of the Maidstone\r\nspecimen[638] (_Pl. III._).\r\n\r\n[638] In a Monograph on the Reptiles of the Cretaceous Deposits of\r\nEngland, published by the Palæontographical Society, Professor Owen has\r\nlately figured anew and described in detail this most valuable fossil\r\nskeleton; to which description are appended the Professor’s latest\r\nviews on the structure of the teeth of this reptile.\r\n\r\nThe \"Geology of the South-east of England\" contains accurate figures\r\nof the long bones of the leg (_Geol. S. E._ pl. ii), femur, clavicles\r\n(_Geol. S. E._ pl. iv.), tympanic bone (_Geol. S. E._ pl. ii.), horn\r\nand ungual bone (_Geol. S. E._ pl. iii.). In the \"Fossils of Tilgate\r\nForest,\" there are fifteen quarto plates devoted to the illustration of\r\nthe bones and teeth of the Iguanodon and other Wealden reptiles. The\r\nosteological structure is fully detailed in _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841,\r\npp. 120-144. A general notice of the principal bones of the Iguanodon,\r\nwith plates, will be found in _Phil.

L. Brickenden,[640] and a fragment of an\r\nupper jaw, found some years since,[641] enable us to form a tolerably\r\nperfect idea of the structure and functions of the dental organs of\r\nthe Iguanodon. The unused tooth of this reptile is characterized by\r\nthe prismatic form of the crown, the presence of from two to four\r\nlongitudinal ridges on its enamelled face, the denticulated margins\r\n(_Lign. 221, a_), and finely serrated edge of the summit, as seen in\r\n_Lign. 220, fig. 3_. The shank or fang of the tooth (_Ligns. 221,\r\n223, fig. 2_) is sub-cylindrical, slightly curved, and tapers to a\r\npoint. The inner surface of the crown in the lower teeth, and the outer\r\nsurface in the upper, are covered with a thick layer of enamel, but the\r\nopposite face of the crown and the sides have but a thin coating of\r\nthis substance. The teeth of the upper jaw (_Lign. 222_) are curved in\r\nthe opposite direction to those of the lower, and have the convexity\r\nexternal, and the concavity internal. Thus the upper and lower molars\r\nwere related to each other nearly as in the Ruminants; the outer aspect\r\nbelow corresponding to the inner above (see _Petrif._ _Lign._ 56, p.\r\n254). The specimens met with have almost always the apex of the crown\r\nmore or less worn down by use[642] (see _Lign. 223_), and presenting\r\nan oblique, triangular, smooth surface, as in the fine large specimen\r\nfigured in _Lign. 221_, which was found imbedded in the trunk of a\r\nClathraria, as if it had snapped off while the animal was in the act of\r\ngnawing the tough stem. The denticulated margins are well developed;\r\nin _fig. 1_, they appear as simple serrations; but viewed laterally,\r\nthey are seen to be formed by a series of denticulated plates (_Lign.\r\n223, fig. 6_). The crown of a tooth of a young animal, worn at the\r\nsummit, and presenting but three longitudinal ridges, is represented\r\n_Pl. VI. fig. 4^a_. The microscropical structure consists of a simple\r\npulp-cavity in the centre of a body of dentine permeated by calcigerous\r\ntubes, but with this peculiar modification, that the dentine is\r\ntraversed by vascular canals, radiating at definite intervals from\r\nthe pulp-cavity nearly to the periphery of the tooth, and running\r\nparallel with the calcigerous tubes; thus constituting a softer and\r\ncoarser dentine than in the other reptiles, and resembling that which\r\ncharacterizes the teeth of some of the herbivorous mammals.[643] The\r\ncrown of the tooth is covered with a layer of enamel, which is thickest\r\non the external surface: and the fang is invested with cement.

The internal structure of the teeth of the Iguanodon is\r\nthus in perfect accordance with their external configuration, and must\r\nhave been admirably adapted, in every stage, for the laceration and\r\ncomminution of the tough vegetable substances which, there is every\r\nreason to conclude, constituted the food of this colossal oviparous\r\nquadruped.\r\n\r\nVertebra of the Iguanodon,[644] _Lign. 206_, p. 653; _Lign. 224_.--The\r\nremains of the vertebral column of the Iguanodon, consisting generally\r\nof broken and water-worn dorsal and caudal vertebræ, deprived of their\r\nprocesses and reduced to the state of the specimens represented _Lign.\r\n206_, _figs._ 6 and 8, are so abundant in some of the Wealden strata,\r\nthat a short account of their characters may be useful. A reference to\r\n_Lign. 206_, and its description, will render the following remarks\r\nintelligible to the general reader. The vertebræ of the Iguanodon are\r\ndistinguishable from those of other reptiles which occur in the same\r\nstrata by the following peculiarities, which the figure of a perfect\r\nspecimen of a caudal vertebra (_Lign. 206, fig 3_) will serve to\r\nillustrate. The body, or centrum, is either flat or somewhat depressed\r\non both articular faces; its sides are nearly flat, or somewhat convex,\r\nvertically (as in _fig 3_), and slightly concave lengthwise, or from\r\nfront to back: in some examples, the body is more contracted towards\r\nthe inferior surface, as in _fig. 6_; and in the vertebræ, near the\r\nmiddle of the tail, the sides are compressed, so as to give an angular\r\ncontour and somewhat vertical elongation to the face, as in _fig. 4_;\r\nbut in the dorsal vertebræ, the articular faces are nearly circular,\r\nbut somewhat higher than wide. In the caudal vertebræ, the inferior\r\nangles of the body are truncated (_w, figs. 3, 4_), and present an\r\noblique, smooth face, to articulate with the chevron bone (_fig. 3,\r\nf_). The annular part is united to the body by suture (_fig. 3,\r\no_), and anchylosed in the dorsal vertebræ; and in these bones the\r\nneural arch is very high, and greatly expanded, and its bases extend\r\ntransversely inwards, and join each other below the spinal canal,\r\nforming a ring, or bony channel, to contain the spinal chord.[645]\r\n\"The transverse processes are straight, and very long in the vertebræ\r\nfrom the middle of the trunk, indicating a considerable expanse of the\r\nabdominal cavity, adapted for the lodgment of the capacious viscera\r\nof a herbivorous quadruped.\" (_Owen._) The spinous processes (_Lign.\r\n206, fig. 3, d_) are large and of great height in the anterior\r\ncaudal vertebræ, _Lign. 224_; and here the chevrons, or hæmapophyses\r\n(_Lign. 224, b_, and _Lign. 206_, _fig. 2_, and _fig. 3, f_), are\r\nalso of considerable length; the bases of the latter are always united\r\n(_Lign. 206, fig. 2, g_), and often blended, so as to form but one\r\nface for articulation with the truncated inferior angles of the body of\r\nthe vertebra:, leaving a vertically elongated channel for the passage\r\nof the large blood-vessels of the tail. The external surface of the\r\nvertebræ of the Iguanodon is more or less marked with fine longitudinal\r\nstriæ; those of the Megalosaurus have a smoother and more polished\r\nsurface.[646]\r\n\r\n[644] A detailed account of the elements of the spinal column of the\r\nIguanodon, and remarks on various fossil vertebræ, the relations of\r\nwhich with the Iguanodon have been considered doubtful, will be found\r\nin _Petrif._ pp. 256-279.\r\n\r\n[645] See also lithographs of dorsal and caudal vertebræ from the\r\nKentish Rag; Owen’s _Monog.

The thigh-bone\r\n(_Lign. 225_; and _Petrif._ p. 292,) is of a very remarkable character,\r\nhaving a closer resemblance to the femur of a huge mammalian, than to\r\nthat of a reptile.[647] Several perfect specimens have been discovered,\r\nas well as the associated bones of the leg (_Petrif._ p. 293, _Lign._\r\n62); but the first fragment that came under my notice, was the\r\nmiddle portion of the shaft of a femur of enormous size, and of an\r\nirregular quadrangular form; and so shapeless and unintelligible it\r\nthen appeared, that several years elapsed before its real nature was\r\ndetermined. (_Foss. Tilg. For._ pl. xviii.)\r\n\r\n[647] See Cuvier’s _Ossem. Foss._ vol. ii. p. 36.\r\n\r\nAn entire thigh-bone of an adult Iguanodon, from the Weald clay in the\r\nwest of Sussex, measured three feet eight inches in length.[648] end\r\nthirty-five inches in circumference at the condyles; and I have a femur\r\nof a very young animal, that is but five inches long. The form of the\r\nthigh-bone is so peculiar, that fragments may easily be recognised. The\r\nhead of the femur (_Lign. 225, f_,) is hemispherical, and projects\r\ninwards; there is no appearance of a _ligamentum teres_; a flattened\r\nprocess or trochanter (_Lign. 225, a_,) forms the external boundary\r\nof the neck of the bone, from which it is separated by a deep and\r\nnarrow vertical fissure; the shaft is of a sub-quadrangular shape, and\r\na slightly elevated ridge, produced by the union of two broad, flat,\r\nlongitudinal surfaces, extends down the middle of the anterior face,\r\nand, diverging towards the inner condyle, gradually disappears. The\r\nbone terminates below in two large condyles, separated in front and\r\nbehind by a deep, narrow cleft, or groove (_Lign. 225, e_). Near the\r\nmiddle of the inner edge of the shaft, there is a compressed ridge,\r\nwith an angular projection, or trochanter. Thus the upper part of\r\nthe femur maybe known by the presence of the flattened, or laterally\r\ncompressed trochanter; and if that process be wanting, a fractured\r\nsurface indicating its position may be detected; the middle of the\r\nshaft is characterized by its broad angular faces, and the inner\r\nsubmedian trochanter: the condyloid or inferior extremity of the bone\r\nmay be distinguished by the deep groove between the condyles, both in\r\nfront and behind.\r\n\r\n[648] The average length of the adult femur is estimated at about four\r\nfeet five inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 225.

The humerus is also present in the\r\nMaidstone specimen[649] of Iguanodon, before referred to at page 692:\r\nin pl. ii. of _Wond._ this bone is termed the _radius_. The humerus of\r\nthis reptile is much smaller than the femur; in the Maidstone specimen\r\nthe former is about 20 inches, and the latter about 33 inches in length.\r\n\r\n[649] The two bones marked \"6\" in pl. ii. _Wond._ and in _Lign._ 65,\r\n_Petrif._ (one of which is figured in outline in _Lign. 226, fig.\r\n4_,) regarded by Prof. Owen as the _radius_ and _ulna_ (the two bones\r\nof the fore-arm): the author’s reasons for regarding these bones as\r\n_metacarpals_ are given in full at p. 289, _Petrif._\r\n\r\nAs separate bones of the feet of the Iguanodon, for example,\r\n_metacarpals_, _metatarsals_, _phalangeals_, and _unguals_, often\r\noccur in the strata of the Wealden, figures of several specimens, on\r\na reduced scale, are introduced in _Lign. 226_, and may enable the\r\nstudent to identify those he may meet with in his researches.[650] The\r\nungual phalanges, or claw-bones, which were invested with the nail, are\r\nsometimes found of an enormous size; from a quarry near Horsham, Mr.\r\nHolmes obtained specimens more than five inches long, and three inches\r\nwide at the articular extremity.\r\n\r\n[650] See Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1841, pp. 137-142.\r\n\r\nLength of the Iguanodon.--The length of the united head and trunk,\r\naccording to my estimate in _Geol. S. E._ p. 316, is seventeen feet\r\nand a half; by Professor Owen’s estimate it is reduced to fifteen\r\nfeet;[651] a difference of no importance in such merely approximative\r\ncalculations, particularly when the form of the cranium is unknown.[652]\r\n\r\n[651] Ibid. p. 144.\r\n\r\n[652] The more recently discovered specimen of lower-jaw, already\r\nreferred to, page 693, indicates a length of between three and four\r\nfeet for the entire jaw, _Petrif._ p. 249.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 226.

My\r\nearly estimate of its length gave rise to the idea of this reptile\r\nhaving attained seventy feet in length. Professor Owen, however,\r\nconsidered that the abbreviated character of the anterior caudal\r\nvertebræ indicated a far less extent of tail, which the Professor\r\nestimated at thirteen feet; this opinion, from the evidence then before\r\nus, seemed well founded, but from evidence since afforded by a series\r\nof eleven caudal vertebra, belonging to the middle region of the tail,\r\nthat have been lately discovered, (_Petrif._ p. 312,) it is not at all\r\nimprobable, that, instead of all the caudal vertebræ being abbreviated,\r\nthese elements of the tail were elongated as in the corresponding part\r\nof the skeleton of the Iguana, and that the largest Iguanodons may have\r\nattained a length of from sixty to seventy feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author’s physiological inferences as to the structure and economy\r\nof the Iguanodon, deduced from the study of the osseous remains of this\r\nsingular creature, especially the lately discovered remains of the\r\njaw-bones, are given in full at pp. 307-313 _Petrif._ or _Foss. Brit.\r\nMus._: and at pp. 335-338, _ibid._ may be found some general remarks\r\non the physical geography and the nature of the fauna and flora of the\r\ncountry inhabited by these stupendous reptiles, whose remains are so\r\ncharacteristic of the Wealden rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nJaw of the Regnosaurus. (_Petrif._ p. 333.)--A portion of the right\r\nramus, or side, of the lower jaw of this reptile was discovered\r\nin a block of sandstone from Tilgate Forest. It consists of a\r\nfragment, six inches long, of the dentary bones, with a small\r\nportion of the opercular; and it contains the fangs of fifteen\r\nteeth, which are closely and evenly set in a regular series, and\r\nimbedded laterally in grooves, or sockets, in the dentary bone;\r\nthere are three or four sockets of successional teeth on the inner\r\nside of the bases of the old teeth. (_Phil. Trans._ 1841, pl.\r\nv. figs. 1, 2.) Unfortunately, all the crowns of the teeth are\r\nwanting. The outer parapet of the dentary piece is entire, and its\r\nupper margin is finely crenated. All the fangs of the teeth are\r\nexposed, but there are traces of a thin inner wall, indicating the\r\nprobability that, as in the Megalosaurus, the teeth were supported\r\nmedially by an osseous plate, and were implanted in distinct\r\nsockets.[654] In my memoir on this fossil jaw in the _Phil.\r\nTrans._ (1841, p. 131), I referred it to the genus Iguanodon;\r\nbut subsequent observations have led me to conclude that it is\r\ngenerically distinct; and in my Memoir on the Jaw of the Iguanodon,\r\nin _Phil. Trans._ 1848 (p. 183), I have proposed for the animal to\r\nwhich it belonged the distinct generic appellation, Regnosaurus,\r\nwith the specific name _Northamptoni_.\r\n\r\n[654] The collector will perceive the importance that attaches to\r\nthe discovery of even a fragment of the jaw of an unknown reptile,\r\ncontaining teeth in their natural position.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LACERTIAN REPTILES.]\r\n\r\nIV. Lacertian Reptiles.--The recent Lacertians, or true Lizards, are\r\nsmaller and less highly organized reptiles than the Saurians of the\r\nCrocodilian order; and their dermal covering consists of a finer and\r\nmore delicate squamous integument. They are also characterized by\r\nimportant modification in their osteological structure. The spinal\r\ncolumn is almost always composed of concavo-convex vertebræ, with the\r\nconvexity behind; the ribs are slender and rounded, having a single\r\nconvex tubercle of attachment. The fossil species are, for the most\r\npart, of gigantic dimensions, and deviate in a striking manner from any\r\nthat now exist. Vertebræ of the recent lacertian type are very rare in\r\nthe secondary strata; I believe a few in my cabinet, obtained from the\r\nsandstone of Tilgate Forest, and which belonged to a very small unknown\r\nreptile, are the most ancient examples at present known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 227. Mosasaurus Hoffmanni.\r\n\r\n(_The original is feet by 2-1/2 feet._)\r\n\r\nRemains of the jaws of the great fossil reptile of Maestricht.]\r\n\r\nMosasaurus. _Bd._ pl. xx.; _Wond._ p. 311; _Petrif._ p. 193.--Of the\r\nfossil lizard of Maestricht, named _Mosasaurus_ (lizard of the Meuse)\r\nfrom the river adjacent to the quarries of St. Peter’s Mountain,\r\nin which its remains have been discovered, I have given a detailed\r\naccount at pages 193-196 of _Petrif._ A specimen, with the jaws, and\r\nbones of the palate armed with teeth, now in the museum at Paris, has\r\nlong been celebrated, and is still the most precious relic of this\r\nextinct reptile hitherto discovered; a reduced representation is given\r\nin _Lign. 227_; and _Pict. Atlas_, pl. lxx. This is the _Mosasaurus\r\nHoffmanni_.[655] The specimen is four and a half feet long, and two\r\nand a half feet wide; it consists of both sides of the lower jaw, with\r\nthe right ramus of the upper jaw in its natural position, and the\r\nleft, which is displaced, lying across the articular extremity of the\r\nleft branch of the lower jaw: of the pterygoid bones, which are armed\r\nwith teeth; of the left tympanic bone (_os quadratum_), which is but\r\nlittle removed from its natural situation, and connects the lower jaw\r\nwith the cranium; one of the metacarpal or metatarsal bones, and some\r\nfragments.[656]\r\n\r\n[655] Several fine portions of the jaws, and many vertebræ of this\r\nanimal, are in the British Museum: see _Foss. Brit. Mus._ p. 139. In a\r\nsplendid work, _Histoire Naturelle de la Montagne de St. Pierre_, by\r\nthe late Faujas St. Fond (1 vol. folio, with numerous plates), there\r\nare admirable figures of the remains of the Mosasaurus.\r\n\r\n[656] In the British Museum there is a cast of this specimen, in a case\r\nnear the bones of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 228.

This interesting paper\r\ncomprises much information regarding the Mosasaurians of the Cretaceous\r\ndeposits of N. America; but we cannot fully coincide with the author in\r\nhis palæontological determinations.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are large, and supported on expanded conical osseous\r\neminences, which are anchylosed to the alveolar ridge of the jaw\r\n(_acrodont_). The crown of the tooth is conical and recurved, with\r\nthe outer face nearly flat, and this space is bordered on each side\r\nby a longitudinal ridge; giving the tooth somewhat of a pyramidal\r\nfigure. (See _Ligns._ 228-230.) Professor Owen states that the crown\r\nconsists of a body of simple and firm dentine, with fine and close-set\r\ncalcigerous tubes, enclosing a simple pulp-cavity; irregular processes\r\nof the latter extend as medullary canals into the conical base of the\r\ntooth, but not, as in the Iguanodon, into the substance of the coronal\r\ndentine; the dentine is invested with a moderately thick coat of\r\nenamel.[658]\r\n\r\n[658] See Odontography, p. 258, and pl. lxxii.; the student should also\r\nconsult Cyclop. Anat. Phys. _Art._ Teeth.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ of the Mosasaur, as is usual in the existing lizards and\r\ncrocodiles, are concave in front and convex behind, and the neural\r\narch is united to the centrum by suture. The entire vertebral column\r\nof _M. Hoffmanni_ appears to have consisted of 131 vertebræ, of which\r\n97 belonged to the tail.[659] This Mosasaur was about twenty-five feet\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n[659] See Cuvier, _Oss. Foss._ vol. v. pp. 326-334.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 229. Tooth of Mosasaurus: _magn. twice._\r\n\r\nEither a pterygoid tooth of M.

Its crocodilian affinities are but partial.\r\n\r\nThe Mosasaurus appears to have had webbed feet, adapted or crawling on\r\nland as well as for swimming,[660] and a long and vertically expanded\r\ntail, serving as a powerful oar, and enabling the animal to stem the\r\nroughest waters.\r\n\r\n[660] See Prof. Owen’s observations on the bones that have been\r\nregarded as referable to the extremities of this creature, and\r\nespecially on the phalangeal and other bones of the Mosasaur of the New\r\nJersey greensand; _Monog. Cret. Rept._ 1851, pp. 36-40.\r\n\r\nProf. Goldfuss has described the remains of another and smaller species\r\nof Mosasaurus (_M. Maximiliani_), from Upper Missouri, U.S.; and Prof.\r\nOwen, in Dixon's \"Fossils of Sussex,\" has established a third and still\r\nsmaller species (_M. gracilis_),[661] to which he refers the four or\r\nfive mosasaurian vertebræ found in the Chalk of Sussex. Two of these\r\n(caudal) are figured in _Geol. S. E._ p. 146, and _Petrif._ _Lign._ 44;\r\nand these and others are lithographed in plate viii. of Prof. Owen’s\r\n_Monog. Cret. Reptilia_, 1851.\r\n\r\n[661] See also _Monograph on the Reptiles of the Chalk_, 1851, p. 31,\r\nand plate ix.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Mosasaurus occur also in the cretaceous sands of New\r\nJersey, U. S. (See Dr. Morton’s _Synopsis of the Organic Remains of the\r\nUnited States_, 1834; and the Quart. Journ. of the Geological Society,\r\nvol. v. 1849.)\r\n\r\nLeiodon anceps.[662]--Under this name Professor Owen has described\r\na splendid fossil, consisting of a portion of the lower jaw of an\r\nacrodont reptile, with teeth, obtained by Edward Charlesworth, Esq.\r\nfrom the Chalk north of the Thames. This specimen was submitted to my\r\ninspection, many years since, by Mr. Charlesworth, and I then pointed\r\nout the analogy of this acrodont jaw to that of the Mosasaurus.\r\n\r\n[662] Ibid. p. 42, pl. ix. A.\r\n\r\nProf. Owen in 1840 (_Odontog._ p. 261), and in 1841 (_Rep. Brit.\r\nAssoc._ p. 144), described and figured some teeth from the same\r\nspecimen, which were lent by Mr. Charlesworth. These teeth the\r\nHunterian Professor regarded as characteristic of a new genus of\r\nMosasauroid reptile, to which he gave the name _Leiodon_ (in allusion\r\nto the smoothness of the teeth). In 1845 (_Rep. Brit. Assoc._ p. 60)\r\nMr. Charlesworth noticed, and in 1846 (_London Geol.

The apex of the crown\r\nis sharp-pointed; the body of the crown is slightly recurved; its base\r\nis expanded into a thick circular fang, which is anchylosed to a short\r\nconical process of the alveolar border of the jaw: the teeth differ\r\nfrom those of the Mosasaurus in having the outer side as convex as the\r\ninner side, the transverse section being an ellipse with pointed ends,\r\nwhich latter correspond with the lateral trenchant edges of the crown\r\nof the tooth: the teeth are more closely set than in the Mosasaur and\r\nGeosaur.

The eyes had a circle of osseous plates in the\r\n_sclerotica_, like those of the Ichthyosaurus; the teeth resemble those\r\nof the Mosasaurus in being sub-compressed and recurved, but they are\r\nat once distinguished by their anterior and posterior finely serrated\r\nsharp edges; the crown is invested with an external coat of enamel.[663]\r\n\r\n[663] Oss.

It is from the Lower Chalk, near Cambridge, and\r\nis in the collection of James Carter, Esq. of that place. Remains of\r\nRaphiosaurus have been found also in the Chalk at Northfleet, Kent.\r\n\r\nDolichosaurus longicollis.--In the Chalk of Kent was found, some years\r\nsince, a considerable portion of the skeleton of a lacertian reptile,\r\nconsisting of the posterior half of the spinal column, with remains of\r\nthe pelvic and thigh bones; it was figured in the _Geol. Trans._ 2d\r\nser. vol. vi. pl. xxxix.; and is now in the collection of Sir P. G.\r\nEgerton. From the researches of the late Mr. Dixon, it appears that a\r\nmutilated reptilian head and anterior portion of a spinal column, with\r\nfore-arm and scapular bones, now in the collection of Mr. Smith, of\r\nTunbridge Wells, belong to the same skeleton as the vertebral remains\r\nabove mentioned. Both specimens were obtained at the same time from\r\nthe well-known chalk-pit at Burham, Kent. Professor Owen has lately\r\ndescribed these interesting remains in detail (_Monog. Cret. Rept._\r\n1851, pp. 22, &c.), and finds no intrinsic contradiction to exist\r\nto the historical evidence adduced as to the probability of the two\r\nmoieties having belonged to the same individual. In the two specimens\r\nthere exist sixty-three concavo-convex (_procœlian_) vertebræ, of which\r\nfifty-seven form the series between the skull and the pelvis, giving\r\nthe trunk a length of about eighteen inches. This unique reptile was\r\nelongate and snake-like in its form, with the abdomen deep and narrow,\r\nlike that of the water-snakes: its limbs were short; its tail, from\r\nthe character of the few caudal vertebræ remaining, must have been\r\nrelatively long and powerful. This long and slender lacertian was\r\ntherefore probably to a considerable degree aquatic in its habits,\r\nswimming with an undulatory eel-like movement.\r\n\r\nThe Dolichosaurus (_long-lizard_) presents somewhat of the ophidian\r\ncharacter in the number and size of its cervical vertebræ, in the size\r\nand shape of its ribs, and in the slender proportions of its trunk and\r\nhead; but, with these partial exceptions, its affinities are truly\r\nlacertian. (Owen.)\r\n\r\nRhynchosaurus articeps. _Lign. 231._--In a quarry of Upper New Red\r\nSandstone at Grinsell, near Shrewsbury, Dr. O. Ward discovered a skull\r\n(3-1/2 inches long), vertebræ, ribs, bones of the pectoral and pelvic\r\narches, portions of two femora with medullary cavities, and fragments\r\nof other bones of a very remarkable lacertian reptile (_Lign. 231_).\r\nThe lower jaw is preserved with the skull in its natural position. The\r\ncranium in its general aspect resembles that of a turtle, rather than\r\nof a lizard; for the intermaxillary bones are double, as in Chelonians,\r\nand symmetrical, and are not united by a median process; they are\r\nvery long, and curve downwards, giving the fore part of the skull the\r\nprofile of a parrot.

Trans._ 2d ser. vol. v. p. 349, pl. xxix.\r\nxxx.). The bones denote an approach to the lizards; the teeth are\r\nimplanted in sockets; these reptiles, therefore, belonged to the group\r\ntermed thecodont, and the name _Thecodontosaurus_, given to these\r\nextinct Saurians by Dr. Riley, has reference to this character. The\r\nteeth are pointed, compressed laterally, slightly convex on each side,\r\nwith a trenchant, finely serrated edge in front and behind; the fang is\r\nsub-cylindrical. Other teeth from the same deposit, possessing the same\r\ngeneral characters, but distinguished by peculiarities of form, have\r\nbeen referred to another genus, named _Palæosaurus_. The vertebræ found\r\nassociated with the teeth and jaws are biconcave, and are remarkably\r\ncharacterized by the great depth of the spinal canal in the middle of\r\nthe centrum or body of the vertebræ, so that the spinal chord must have\r\npresented a moniliform or bead-like appearance. These reptiles, in\r\ntheir _thecodont_ type of dentition, biconcave vertebræ, double-headed\r\nribs, and proportionate size of the bones of the extremities, are\r\nnearly allied to the _Teleosaurus_, (see _ante_, p. 679); but they\r\ncombine a lacertian form of tooth, and a lacertian structure of the\r\npectoral, and probably of the pelvic arches, with these crocodilian\r\ncharacters; they have also distinctive modifications: such, for\r\nexample, as the moniliform spinal chord.[665]\r\n\r\n[665] Owen; Rep.

It is distinguished, by\r\nsome remarkable peculiarities of structure, from other animals of the\r\nSaurian order; of which it represents a new tribe, or sub-order. The\r\ncranium is narrow; the nostrils are divided, as in Lizards, and not\r\nconfluent, as in Chelonia; the skull, in other respects, much resembles\r\nin general appearance that of a Turtle; the orbits are large; the\r\njaws are edentulous, as in the Turtles, with the exception of a pair\r\nof long tusks,[666] implanted in sockets in the upper maxillary bone,\r\nlike those of the Walrus; these tusks are of a finer texture than\r\nthat of the Crocodile’s teeth, and almost as dense as in the Hyæna.\r\nThese creatures present in the most striking manner that blending of\r\nthe peculiarities of several existing orders, which is continually\r\npresented to the palæontologist; for with a type essentially lacertian\r\nare combined crocodilian and chelonian modifications. Although no\r\nvestiges of these reptiles have been discovered in England or in\r\nEurope, yet the occurrence of an allied form, the _Rhynchosaurus_\r\n(_Lign. 231_), in our New Red Sandstone, and the probability that the\r\nSouth African reptiliferous deposits may, from their position, belong\r\nto the Triassic Epoch, induce me to give a somewhat extended notice\r\nof these extraordinary fossils: and I am led to do so on another\r\naccount, namely, because the memoir,[667] of which the following is a\r\nbrief abstract, is so excellent an example of the manner in which such\r\ninvestigations should be conducted, so as to arrive at any satisfactory\r\nconclusions as to the characters and relations of the lost types of\r\nbeings, whose fragmentary and petrified relics are the only vestiges\r\nthat remain.\r\n\r\n[666] Hence the generic name, _Dicynodon_: from δις (twice), and\r\nκυνὁδονς (canine tooth).\r\n\r\n[667] Prof. Owen’s Memoir on the Dicynodon, Geol.

This\r\nis a dental character which, with this exception, is peculiar to the\r\nmammalia (the Walrus, Musk-deer, and Machairodus), and is rare even in\r\nthat class.\r\n\r\n_Examination of the skull._--One of the crania showed the median\r\nundivided process of a single _intermaxillary_ bone, ascending and\r\nseparating _two distinct anterior nasal apertures_; in another, the\r\nboundaries of a very much contracted cranial cavity were evident:\r\nthese characters combined to prove that the skulls were referable to\r\nair-breathing oviparous and cold-blooded animals, or Reptiles; but\r\nneither to Crocodilians nor Chelonians, and for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1stly. The originals were not mammalians; for no mammalian has the\r\n_intermaxillary bone single_ (as in _Lign. 233, a_), or the _external\r\nbony nasal aperture double_; and neither mammalian nor bird has the\r\ncavity for the brain so relatively small as in this fossil.\r\n\r\n2dly. They were not Crocodiles; for in all crocodiles the\r\nintermaxillary bone is divided by a suture, and the anterior nasal\r\naperture is single and on the median line, as in mammalia.\r\n\r\n3dly. They were not Chelonians; for all turtles have the nasal opening\r\nsingle and placed in the middle of the fore-part of the skull, in the\r\nvery situation which, in the Dicynodon, is occupied by the convex\r\nimperforate median plate of the broad intermaxillary bone.\r\n\r\n4thly. They could not be Fishes, as those animals have no well-defined\r\nexternal respiratory nasal apertures.\r\n\r\n5thly. They were neither Batrachians (frogs) nor Ophidians (serpents);\r\nfor, although the reptiles of these two orders have a single\r\nintermaxillary and double nostrils, like the fossils, the latter are\r\nat once separated from them by the presence of a strong and complete\r\nzygomatic arch (_Ligns._ 232 and 233, _g_, _d_), continued from the\r\ntympanic bone to the large immovably articulated superior maxillary.\r\n\r\nLastly, the characters last named, and the presence of vertical\r\ntympanic pedicles (_Lign. 232, l_), suspended by their upper part to\r\nthe junction of the zygomatic and mastoid bones, prove the affinity to\r\nthe lacertians or true lizards.\r\n\r\nThese bidental crania have certain characters in common with that of\r\nthe Rhynchosaur, which is also, as we have before seen, of the true\r\nlacertian group, but the Dicynodonts are more nearly allied to the\r\nCrocodiles and the Chelonians than the Rhynchosaurus appears to be.\r\n\r\nReferring to the original Memoir for anatomical details, I must limit\r\nthis notice to a few additional general remarks. Both the jaws are\r\nedentulous, with the exception of the pair of tusks, as in Chelonians;\r\nthere are no traces of teeth, or of their sockets, in the lower jaw,\r\nwhich is short and very deep, and anchylosed at the symphysis, as in\r\nturtles; the alveolar border forms a smooth trenchant edge, which shuts\r\nwithin the corresponding part of the upper jaw: it is probable that\r\nboth jaws were covered by horn, as in the chelonians. The tusks are\r\nimplanted in wide and deep conical alveoli in the suborbital part of\r\nthe maxillary bone, and project about two inches beyond the sockets\r\n(_Lign. 232_); they are long and pointed, and are directed downwards\r\nand forwards, with a slight backward curve, and slightly converge\r\ntowards their extreme points (_Lign. 233_). These teeth consist of\r\na simple body of unvascular dentine, with a very thin external coat\r\nof enamel. The tooth-ivory is more dense than in any known reptile,\r\nand approaches in its intimate texture that of the canines of the\r\ncarnivorous mammals. The base of the tooth has a conical cavity\r\n(_Lign. 234_), indicating a persistent matrix or dental pulp, the\r\nrest of the tooth without the socket being solid. There are no traces\r\nwhatever of the germs of successional teeth. It is therefore inferred,\r\nthat, like the tusks and scalpriform incisors of mammalia, the canine\r\nor maxillary teeth of the Dicynodon were capable of constant growth\r\nand renovation; thus offering an approach to the typical dentition of\r\nmammalia, unknown in any other reptiles.\r\n\r\nAs the points of the teeth in the only known perfect specimen are\r\nunworn, it is inferred that these tusks were not employed either as\r\ninstruments for obtaining food, as in the Dugong, or for locomotion, as\r\nin the Walrus, but were simply offensive and defensive weapons.[670]\r\n\r\n[670] See Prof. Owen’s detailed account of these curious dental organs\r\nin the Memoir already referred to, and in the _Art._ Teeth, in the\r\nCyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 234.\r\n\r\nDicynodon testudiceps.

It was obtained by Mr. Patrick Duff, in\r\n1851; and a detailed description of this unique fossil, with an\r\nillustrative plate, will be found in the Quarterly Journal of the\r\nGeological Society, vol. viii. pp. 100, _et seq._; together with a\r\nnotice by Captain Brickenden of the geology of the district where\r\nthe specimen was found, and a paper on some fossil foot-prints,[673]\r\ndiscovered by this geologist in the same rock.\r\n\r\n[671] The word Telerpeton simply denotes the remote antiquity of this\r\nDevonian reptile of Scotland, τἡλε (far off), ἑρπετον (reptile); the\r\ntrivial name, _Elginense_, records the locality from whence it was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[672] A model of this most delicate and valuable impression has been\r\ndeposited in the palæontological gallery of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[673] A general notice of the fossil foot-prints, or _Ichnolites_, that\r\nhave been referred to Reptiles will be given at a subsequent page of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nBy reference to _Lign. 235_, it will be seen that the cranium is almost\r\nwholly lost; a few conical teeth, mostly of a very small size, were\r\nobserved in connexion with the vestige of the jaws. The spinal column\r\nis represented by the impressions of about thirty-six vertebræ, eleven\r\nor twelve of which belong to its caudal portion. The vertebræ present\r\nsome faint evidence of their possessing a biconcave form; the length of\r\none of the dorsal vertebræ is 1/9th of an inch. There are twenty-one\r\npairs of long slender ribs. The pectoral arch and anterior extremities\r\nhave nearly disappeared in the fracture of the stone. The pelvis\r\nand sacrum are very obscure; the latter is formed probably of two\r\nanchylosed vertebra;. The thigh-bones are somewhat curved; the tibia is\r\ngently bowed, and expanded at each extremity. There are no remains of\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 235.

Probably the original was a peculiar type, which, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge, it would be rash to ascribe to either\r\norder. The length of the original animal could not have exceeded six or\r\nseven inches. _Lign. 236_ represents in outline the probable form of\r\nthis small, but most interesting reptile.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Pterosaurians, or Flying Reptiles.--Pterodactylus (_wing-fingered\r\nreptile_). _Lign. 237._ _Petrif._ p. 187; _Wond._ p. 577; _Bd._\r\npl. xxi. xxii.--The extinct reptiles denominated Pterodactyles,\r\nconstituting a few genera of an order of Saurians organized for\r\naërial life,[674] are unquestionably the most marvellous even of the\r\nwonderful beings which the relics of the Age of Reptiles have enabled\r\nthe palæontologist to reconstruct. With a long-snouted head and long\r\nneck, much resembling that of a bird, bat-like wings, and a small\r\ntrunk and tail, with lacertian affinities in its skull, teeth, and\r\nskeleton, and with a bird-like structure of sternum and scapular arch,\r\nthese creatures present an anomaly of structure as unlike their fossil\r\ncontemporaries, as is the duck-billed Ornithorhynchus, of Australia,\r\nto existing animals. The cranium, or brain-case, is small; the jaws\r\nare either long, and armed with numerous sharp-pointed teeth, or\r\ntoothless, like those of a bird. The teeth of the Pterodactyle are\r\nall laniary; they are simple, of a conical form, recurved, with but\r\nlittle difference in their form and size, and implanted in distinct\r\nsockets, with wide intervals between each. In some species there are\r\ntwenty-eight or thirty in the lower, and twenty-two in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n[674] The only known recent reptile at all analogous is the little\r\n_Draco volans_ of the East Indian Islands; but even this can scarcely\r\nbe regarded as a flying animal, its lateral membranous expansions,\r\nwhich are rather parachutes than wings, and formed by elongated ribs,\r\nnot by the fingers, presenting but a rudimentary condition of wings\r\ncompared with those of the Bat and the Pterodactyle.\r\n\r\nThe orbit is very large; the sclerotica consists of an annular row\r\nof bony plates, but less in number than in the Ichthyosaurus; the\r\nexternal orifice of the nostrils is near the orbits; remains of the _os\r\nhyoides_ (bone of the tongue) have been observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 237. Pterodactylus crassirostris: 1/2 _nat. size_.\r\n\r\n_Oolite._ _Solenhofen._]\r\n\r\nThe cervical vertebræ are large and strong, and capable of great\r\nflexibility forwards and backwards, probably to allow the head to fall\r\nback to the centre of gravity during flight. There are frequently\r\ntraces of ossified condition of the tendons of the muscles of the neck.\r\nThis is well seen in _P. macronyx_ and _P. crassirostris_ (_Lign.\r\n237_), and is a peculiarity dependent on the additional support required\r\nby the long neck of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal vertebræ are from seventeen to twenty in number. The sacrum\r\nis formed by the coalescence of two vertebræ only, as in existing\r\nreptiles, and not of many, as in birds and certain extinct saurians.\r\nThe tail is generally short, an unusual character with saurians; but a\r\nspecies with a long tail occurs at Solenhofen.\r\n\r\nThere are five toes or digits on each foot; the outer finger of the\r\nfore-arm is immensely elongated, for the support of a membranous\r\nexpansion (the impression of this wing-membrane is preserved on the\r\nstone in some examples); and the other digits, of fore and hind feet,\r\nterminated in long curved claws. The size and form of the extremities\r\nshow that the _Pterodactylus_ was capable of perching on trees, of\r\nhanging against perpendicular surfaces, and of standing firmly on the\r\nground, when, with its wings folded, it might crawl on all-fours, and\r\nwalk or hop like a bird. A reference to the graphic description of the\r\ncharacters and probable habits of these beings, by Dr. Buckland, _Bd._\r\ni. p. 221, and the beautiful illustrations accompanying it (_Bd._ ii.\r\npl. xxi. xxii.), will equally instruct and gratify the reader.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect examples of the _Pterodactyles_ have been discovered\r\nin the lithographic stone of Monheim, Pappenheim, and Solenhofen, where\r\ntheir bones are associated with the remains of _Dragon-flies_ (see\r\np. 551) and other insects. In England, bones of these reptiles have\r\nbeen obtained from the Lias of Lyme Regis, from the Oolitic slate of\r\nStonesfield, from the Wealden strata of Tilgate Forest, and the Chalk\r\nof Kent.[675] One of the most interesting British specimens consists\r\nof a considerable part of the skeleton of a species about the size\r\nof a Raven, discovered by the late Mary Anning, in the Lias of Lyme\r\nRegis, and now deposited in the British Museum.[676] It consists of\r\nthe principal bones of the extremities, and of several vertebra:, and\r\nis figured and described by Dr. Buckland, _Geol. Trans._ 2d ser. vol.\r\niii. pl. xxvii. This specimen is distinguished by a greater length of\r\nthe claws (whence the name of the species, _P. macronyx_, _long-claw_,)\r\nthan in any previously known.\r\n\r\n[675] For a detailed description of the Pterosaurian remains from the\r\nEnglish Chalk, with numerous beautiful illustrations, see Prof. Owen s\r\n_Monograph_, published by the Palæontographical Society, 1851. Other\r\nimportant memoirs on Pterodactyles and their structure, not mentioned\r\nin the text, are, by Von Meyer, in _Nova Acta Acad. Nat.

It has been estimated\r\nthat some of these gigantic flying reptiles possessed an extent of wing\r\nsurpassing that of the great albatross. The _Pterodactylus Cuvieri_ had\r\nprobably an expanse of wing not less than eighteen feet from tip to\r\ntip; another Chalk species, _P. compressirostris_, fifteen feet; whilst\r\nthe _P. macronyx_, of the Lias, measured about four feet seven inches\r\nfrom the extremity of one wing to that of the other.[677]\r\n\r\n[677] Bowerbank, _Rep.

Chelonian Reptiles.--Those singular reptiles, commonly known by the\r\nname of Tortoises and Turtles, and designated by naturalists Chelonia\r\n(from _Chelone_, the Greek term for a Tortoise), are distinguished\r\nfrom all other animals by the osseous cuirass in which their bodies\r\nare enclosed, the head and neck, extremities, and tail, alone being\r\nexcluded. This remarkable bony case is produced by the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the bones of the thorax and back; and consists of an\r\nunder (_sternal_) and an upper (_dorsal_) portion. The breast-plate,\r\nor _plastron_, which is the true sternum, is composed of nine pieces\r\nof bone, eight of which are in pairs, and the ninth, or odd plate, is\r\nsituated between the four anterior plates. The variation in the form\r\nof these plates is considerable, and affords important distinctive\r\ncharacters. In the young state of land and fresh-water tortoises, there\r\nare vacancies between the pieces, which are filled up in the adult, the\r\nwhole being ultimately united into one bony plate; but in the marine\r\nturtles (and also in the _Trionyces_, or soft tortoises), these pieces\r\ndo not completely unite, and interspaces always remain. The bones of\r\nwhich the dorsal buckler, _carapace_, or upper shield is composed\r\nconsist of eight of the ten pairs of ribs, united by a longitudinal\r\nseries of angular plates, which are attached to the annular part of\r\nthe vertebra throughout the whole, or a great part of their length,\r\naccording to the age and species of the individual.[678] Numerous\r\nmodifications exist in the form of the buckler, in its flatness or\r\nconvexity, in the degree of extension of the ribs, and their angular\r\nplates, and in the characters of the scutes or horny integument with\r\nwhich the carapace is covered; and with corresponding variations in the\r\nhead, and in the locomotive extremities, in the numerous species and\r\ngenera of the Chelonian reptiles, according to their adaptation to a\r\nterrestrial, fluviatile, or marine existence.\r\n\r\n[678] In the Monograph on Eocene Reptiles, 1849, Prof. Owen has given\r\na succinct account of the carapace and plastron of the _Chelone_,\r\nand a brief notice of the composition and homologies of these bony\r\nencasements in the Tortoise, with references to more particular and\r\ncomprehensive memoirs by himself and others.\r\n\r\nThe animals of this order are arranged in four principal groups, viz.\r\nthe marine, or Turtles (_Chelones_); the fluviatile, or river-Tortoises\r\n(_Trionyces_); the marsh-Tortoises (_Emydes_); and the terrestrial or\r\nland-Tortoises (_Testudines_). The marine Chelonians generally feed\r\nupon vegetables; the _Emys_ and _Trionyx_ approach more nearly to the\r\nterrestrial than to the marine species; they are carnivorous, feeding\r\non frogs, fishes, fresh-water mollusca, and other small animals. The\r\n_Trionyces_ differ from their congeners in being destitute of a horny\r\nexternal integument, having no scutes on the buckler or any other\r\npart of the body but the osseous carapace is invested with a strong\r\ntough skin, which equally covers the dorsum and sternum, to which it\r\nfirmly adheres; the dermal surface of the bones in these Tortoises is\r\nalways rugose, and either granulated, or covered with punctations and\r\ndepressions. The buckler of the Trionyces is of a depressed form, with\r\na soft flattened margin. The Testudinidæ, or land-Tortoises, are too\r\nwell known to render any description requisite for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the marine species, eight pairs of ribs and thirteen plates of the\r\nlongitudinal series form the buckler; the ribs or costal plates are\r\nunited to each other through a great part of their extent; but towards\r\ntheir distal or outer extremities each rib contracts, and terminates\r\nin a point, which is supported on a marginal series of bony plates;\r\nthe intervals between the ribs are filled up in the living animal by a\r\ncartilaginous membrane which never becomes ossified. This character,\r\ntherefore, affords an important aid in the discrimination of the fossil\r\nremains of this family.[679]\r\n\r\n[679] The reader will recognise this peculiarity in the gilded skeleton\r\nof the carapace of Turtles, frequently exhibited in the soup-shops of\r\nthe metropolis.\r\n\r\nIn the terrestrial and the marsh Tortoises, the ossification is\r\ncomplete in the adult state; but in the fluviatile Trionyces, which\r\nare without a horny integument, there is no border, or marginal series\r\nof bony plates, and the extremities of the ribs are therefore always\r\ndistinct, and generally have an obtuse extremity. The skeletons of\r\nthe three groups present corresponding modifications, and an accurate\r\nknowledge of the osteology of the recent animals is necessary to\r\nenable the palæontologist to arrive at secure conclusions as to the\r\ncharacters and relations of the fossil species.[680] We can only\r\nadvert to one remarkable osteological character,--the construction\r\nof the shoulder, which differs from that of all other animals, in\r\nbeing situated within the cavity of the thorax, instead of without.\r\nIn consequence of this modification, a process of the shoulder-blade\r\n(_scapula_ or _omoplate_), termed the _acromion_, is largely developed,\r\nand the shoulder-bone is tri-mucronate, or three-pronged, consisting of\r\na short, thick head, containing a concavity (which, with that on the\r\ncoracoid-bone, forms a socket for the arm-bone), and of two diverging\r\nbranches. This form is so peculiar, that the collector can be at no\r\nloss to recognise the shoulder-bone of a _Chelonian_, should it come\r\nunder his notice with other fossil relics (see _Foss. Til. For._ pl.\r\nxix. _fig._ 11). The shoulder-blade and its associated coracoid-bone\r\nundergo certain modifications in the three groups of Turtles, by\r\nwhich the anatomist may pretty certainly determine the terrestrial,\r\nfluviatile, or marine character of the animals to which they belonged.\r\nThe successful application of a perfect knowledge of this department of\r\nosteology, is admirably exemplified in the works to which reference has\r\nbeen made; and even but a slight acquaintance with its principles will\r\noften enable us to obtain some general information as to the nature and\r\nrelations of fossil Chelonians.\r\n\r\n[680] The student should consult Cuvier’s _Ossemens Fossiles_, tom. v.\r\npart ii^{me.} chap. ii.: and Prof. Owen’s _Monographs_, published by\r\nthe Palæontographical Society, 1849, 1851, 1853. The Penny Cyclopædia,\r\n_Art._ Tortoises, contains an excellent summary of the osteology of\r\nthese reptiles, also an abstract of Professor Owen’s Report on the\r\nFossil _Chelonia_.\r\n\r\nThe student will remember that all the Chelonians are edentulous, _i.\r\ne._ toothless; their bony jaws being covered by horny sheaths, as in\r\nbirds; these mandibles are therefore the only dental organs that can\r\noccur in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TURTLES AND TORTOISES.]\r\n\r\nFossil Turtles and Tortoises.[681]--Some of the earliest indications of\r\nthe presence of Reptiles on our planet are afforded by the foot-prints\r\nof Chelonian animals on the surfaces of the layers of sandstone of\r\nthe Old Red formation at Elgin, and of the New Red in Dumfriesshire,\r\nat Storeton, near Liverpool, and at some places in Germany (see _Bd._\r\ni. p. 259, and p. 265, note). But no osseous remains of the animals\r\nof this family have hitherto been found in strata antecedent to the\r\nOolite. The Solenhofen quarries (Kelheim) have yielded the bones and\r\ncarapaces of several Emydian tortoises, and some remains of Chelonians\r\nhave been found at Stonesfield, and in the Portland Sandstone.[682]\r\nIn the Jura limestone at Soleure, two large species of Emydians have\r\nbeen discovered. The Wealden and Purbeck formations abound in Chelonian\r\nremains of both fluviatile and marine genera. From the Isle of Purbeck\r\nnumerous fine examples have been obtained;[683] my own researches\r\nin the strata of Tilgate Forest (_Foss. Til. For._ p. 60) have also\r\nbrought to light several species, and in particular an interesting\r\nChelonian related to the soft-skinned, fresh-water tortoises,\r\n_Trionyces_ (_Geol. S. E._ p. 255). In the Cretaceous formation of\r\nEngland the remains of these reptiles are not frequent. The Greensand\r\nof Cambridgeshire (_Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841, p. 172,) has yielded a\r\nmarine species, and that of Kent a fine Emydian form (Owen, _Monog._\r\n1851); and in the White Chalk a few examples have been obtained, to\r\nwhich we shall hereafter more particularly allude. On the Continent\r\nfine examples have been found in the slate of Glaris (see _Bd._ pl.\r\nxxv′.); and in the upper Cretaceous strata of the Netherlands, at\r\nMaestricht, and at Melsbroeck, near Brussels, many beautiful specimens\r\nof fresh-water tortoises (_Emydes_), and marine turtles (_Chelones_),\r\nhave from time to time been obtained; these are figured and described\r\nby Baron Cuvier (_Oss. Foss._ tom. v. pp. 236, 239). In the Eocene\r\nstrata of England, several species of Chelonians have been collected;\r\nof these eleven belong to the marine genus _Chelone_; eight to the\r\nfresh-water _Trionyx_; and eight to the marsh-tortoises, _Emys_ and\r\n_Platemys_. The Isle of Sheppey and Hordwell have yielded the majority\r\nof these relics; the turtles are smaller than the recent analogues,\r\nwhich now inhabit intertropical latitudes.[684] The Eocene strata\r\nof France contain several fresh-water tortoises, some of which are\r\nreferable to the Emydes, and others to the Trionyces. From the gypsum\r\nbeds, near Paris, the remains of one or two species of Trionyx have\r\nbeen obtained (_Oss. Foss._ tom. v. p. 222), of another at Aix, in\r\nProvence, and of three or four species in other localities. A fine\r\nspecimen of fresh-water tortoise from Œningen, near Constance, is\r\ndescribed and figured by Professor Bell in Geol. Trans. 2d ser. vol.\r\niii. The fossil remains of _Testudinidæ_, or land-tortoises, are\r\nexceedingly rare. No well-determined remains are known in the British\r\nstrata; the impressions of scutes found in the Stonesfield slate, and\r\nthe foot-prints above described, being the only indications of the\r\nexistence of these reptiles. The presence of land-tortoises in the\r\nstrata of France appears to be equally problematical, for the relics\r\nobtained from Montmartre and Aix (_Oss. Foss._ p. 245) afford no\r\ncertain data as to the character of the original.\r\n\r\n[681] See _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841, pp. 168, et seq.\r\n\r\n[682] See _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841. pp. 160 and 169.\r\n\r\n[683] Some of the most beautiful of these almost perfect specimens\r\nhave lately been figured and described by Prof. Owen in his Monograph\r\non the Fossil Chelonian Reptiles of the Wealden and the Purbeck;\r\nPalæontographical Society, 1853.\r\n\r\n[684] Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1841, p. 177, and Monograph on Fossil Reptiles,\r\nPal. Soc. 1849, in which the anatomical details are given with the\r\ncharacteristic accuracy and minuteness of the author.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary formations of India, however, have furnished decided\r\nexamples of fossil terrestrial tortoises; and among the innumerable\r\nrelics of the beings of an earlier world, which the indefatigable\r\nlabours of Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley have brought to light, and\r\nwhich those accomplished naturalists have so skilfully developed, are\r\nthe remains of land tortoises of prodigious magnitude (_Colossochelys\r\natlas_); one specimen indicating a length of twelve or fourteen feet,\r\nwith a breadth and height of corresponding proportions! These remains\r\nare associated with the bones gigantic extinct mammalia, allied to the\r\n_Palæotheria_ and other pachyderms of the eocene deposits of the Paris\r\nbasin; and with those of Emydian and Crocodilian reptiles.[685]\r\n\r\n[685] _Petrif._ pp. 11 and 468.\r\n\r\nFossil Marine Turtles.--In illustration of this subject, I select a\r\nspecimen discovered in the lower Chalk, at Burham, Kent, which is\r\nremarkable for its beautiful state of preservation, and its peculiar\r\nosteological characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 238.

The quarry whence it was obtained is situated at Burham, a\r\nshort distance from the banks of the Medway, between Chatham and\r\nMaidstone, and presents a good section of the lower Chalk. This\r\nlocality is rich in fossil remains, rivalling in this respect the\r\nquarries near Lewes, Worthing, and Arundel, in Sussex. Two other\r\nfossil Turtles have been obtained from this quarry, and now enrich\r\nthe cabinets of Sir P. Egerton and Mr. Bowerbank. Other relics of\r\nChelonians found in this place are four marginal plates of the\r\ncarapace, and fragments of ribs,[686] some marginal plates of a much\r\nlarger individual, mandibles, and other fragments, which are noticed\r\nin Prof. Owen’s Monograph, 1851. The specimen, of which _Lign. 238_ is\r\na reduced figure, consists of the dorsal buckler or carapace almost\r\nentire; it is of a depressed elliptical form, with a longitudinal\r\nmedian ridge; it is six inches in length, and three and a half inches\r\nin breadth across the middle. It is composed of eight ribs, or costal\r\nplates, on each side the dorsal ridge, which is formed of ten neural\r\nplates; and there is a border of marginal plates. These plates are\r\nunited to each other by finely indented sutures, and bear the imprints\r\nof the horny scutes, or tortoise-shell, with which they were originally\r\ninvested. The expanded ribs are united throughout the proximal half\r\nof their length, and gradually taper to their marginal extremities,\r\nwhich are supported by the plates of the osseous border.[687] This\r\ndescription applies to the specimen as seen in _Lign. 238_; but Mr.\r\nBensted so skilfully cleared away the chalk as to admit of the\r\nremoval of a great part of the dorsal shield, by which means some of\r\nthe vertebræ, four sternal (_hyosternal_ and _hyposternal_) plates,\r\nand one of the coracoid bones are displayed. This brief description\r\nwill suffice to convey a general idea of the characters of this\r\nfossil, which differs from any known recent turtle, and possesses\r\nsome anomalous features, that appear to indicate some slight Emydian\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\n[686] See _Geol.

Its surface displays\r\na fibrous cancellated structure, denoting the attachment of the horny\r\nsheath with which, in a recent state, it was covered. More or less\r\nperfect specimens of such mandibles also occur in the Chalk of Kent and\r\nelsewhere, but no bones of the skull have yet been met with in that\r\ndeposit. In the Greensand of Cambridgeshire, however, the cranium of a\r\nsmall turtle has been found. It is figured and described by Prof. Owen\r\nas _Chelone pulchriceps_ (_Monograph_, 1851).\r\n\r\nChelone Bellii. _Lign. 240_, _Petrif._ 155.--In the strata of Tilgate\r\nForest, fragments of the carapace, of the plastron or sternum, and of\r\nthe marginal plates, with some of the bones of the extremities, of a\r\nlarge marine turtle have been discovered; several specimens are figured\r\nin _Foss. Til. For._ pl. vi. and vii. Some examples must have belonged\r\nto an individual at least three feet in length. Unfortunately, the\r\nspecimens hitherto obtained are very imperfect, and do not exhibit\r\nessential distinctive characters, with the exception of the ribs, which\r\nare united to within a short distance of their distal or marginal\r\nextremities; hence the costal interspaces are reduced to much smaller\r\ndimensions than in any recent or fossil Turtles with which I have had\r\nthe means of comparing them. The fragment of a rib, imbedded in Tilgate\r\ngrit, figured _Lign. 240_, well exhibits this character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 240. Chelone Bellii[688] (G. A.

Foss._ pl. vi. _fig._ 2, is referred to the\r\nnewly named _Ch. costata_, characterized by its broad and prominent\r\nribs. A third name even (_Ch. Mantelli_) has been bestowed on this\r\ninteresting fossil, by a German palæontologist.\r\n\r\nFossil fresh-water Tortoises.--The remains of fresh-water Tortoises,\r\nreferable to the _Emydidæ_, occur in the Purbeck and Wealden strata\r\n(Owen’s _Monograph_, 1853, and _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841); the\r\nresemblance of some of these to the Jurassic species from Soleure was\r\nnoticed by Cuvier (_Oss. Foss._ vol. v.). Among the Chelonian remains\r\nof the Wealden, some of the most remarkable are the costal plates\r\nand other bones of a Tortoise, which in its essential characters is\r\nclosely allied to the Trionyces,[689] but differs from the recent\r\nforms, in having possessed a dermal horny integument, formed of\r\nscutes of tortoise-shell. The chelonians of the genus Trionyx (so\r\nnamed from their having three claws) have the extremities of the ribs\r\nfree, and not articulated to a border of marginal plates, and there\r\nare intervals between their costal plates even in the adult state.\r\nThe external surface of the bones of the buckler is covered with\r\ngranulations, or with little pits, for the attachment of the soft\r\nskin, the only integument with which these animals are invested; and,\r\nbeing destitute of horny scutes, their bones exhibit no furrows, as\r\nin the other genera. But the fossil rib-plates (see _Lign. 241_) have\r\na shagreen-like or punctated surface, like the recent Trionyces, and\r\nat the same time bear the imprints of horny scutes; and, instead of\r\nbeing nearly of an equal width throughout their entire length, as in\r\nthe existing species, have one extremity much wider than the other,\r\nas in the land-tortoises. From the slight degree of convexity of\r\nthe ribs, it is evident that the carapace was much flattened, as in\r\nthe Trionyx.[690] Except in having a defensive dermal integument,\r\nand agreeing in this respect with many of the Crocodilian reptiles,\r\nwith which its bones are associated, the original must have closely\r\nresembled the existing predaceous fresh-water soft Turtles; and,\r\ndoubtless, like those reptiles, inhabited the muddy beds of lakes and\r\nrivers, preying upon the eggs and young of the larger reptiles, and\r\non the uniones and other fluviatile mollusca, whose shells are very\r\ncommonly found imbedded with its remains.\r\n\r\n[689] The relations of these peculiar remains to _Trionyx_ were pointed\r\nout in _Foss.

But this name does not appear in the list of British\r\nChelonians, either in _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841, or in Mr. Morris’s\r\n_Cat. Brit. Org. Rem._ 1843.

These specimens,\r\ntogether with others in the collections of Messrs. Saull, Bowerbank,\r\nDixon, Combe, and S. Wood, have been figured and described, and their\r\nrelations to existing types elaborately worked out, by Professor\r\nOwen.[692] The _Palæophis typhæus_, from the Bracklesham clay, had a\r\nlength of about twenty feet, and, from the compressed character of\r\nits caudal vertebræ, was probably a sea-serpent. A somewhat smaller\r\nspecies also occurs at Bracklesham. The Sheppey specimens are referred\r\nto another species of this extinct genus, namely, the _P. toliapicus_\r\n(_Lign. 242_); it was from ten to twelve feet in length. The remains of\r\ntwo species of land-serpents, respectively about four and three feet\r\nlong, have been found at Hordwell Cliff.

Batrachians.--The reptiles termed Batrachians (from the Greek\r\nname for Frog) are characterized by the metamorphoses which they\r\nundergo in the progress of their development from the young to the\r\nadult state; the Frog, Toad, and Newt are familiar examples of this\r\norder. Their organs of aërial respiration consist of a pair of lungs;\r\nbut in their young state they are provided with gills, supported, as\r\nin fishes, by cartilaginous arches. These organs disappear, in most\r\nspecies, when the animals arrive at maturity; but in a few genera, as\r\nthe Siren and Proteus, they are persistent. The skeletons of these\r\nreptiles present corresponding modifications. The skull is, for the\r\nmost part, much depressed, and the cerebral cavity small; it is united\r\nto the vertebral column by two distinct condyles, situated on the\r\nsides of the occipital or cranio-spinal aperture.[696] The vertebral\r\ncolumn, in some genera (as, for example, in the common frog), is very\r\nshort, and is reduced to eight or ten bones, the caudal vertebræ being\r\nfused into a long cylindrical style; but in the higher organised\r\nBatrachians the spine is composed of concavo-convex vertebræ, as in\r\nthe Crocodile: in the lower type, as the Siren, Proteus, and Axolotl,\r\nthe vertebræ are biconcave, as in numerous species of fossil Saurians.\r\nThe ribs are merely rudimentary, being very short and few; a condition\r\nwhich has relation to the mode of reproduction in these animals, the\r\neggs being accumulated and shed at once.[697] Some of the Batrachians\r\nare edentulous, but others have numerous small, conical, uniform,\r\nclosely-arranged teeth, placed either in a single row, or aggregated\r\nlike the rasp-teeth in fishes.[698]\r\n\r\n[696] Saurians, like birds, have a single occipital condyle.\r\n\r\n[697] See Dr. Roget’s _Bridgewater Essay_, p. 395.\r\n\r\n[698] The variations in the dental system of these animals are given in\r\n_Odontography_, chap. ii. p. 187.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BATRACHIANS.]\r\n\r\nBatracholites; or fossil remains of Batrachians.--The skeletons,\r\nvestiges of the soft parts, and imprints of the feet of several genera\r\nof Batrachians occur in a fossil state in tertiary deposits, all of\r\nwhich, like the existing races, appear to belong to fresh-water or\r\nterrestrial species. In the pliocene or newer tertiary strata, on the\r\nbanks of the Rhine, at Œningen, and in the _papierkohle_ of the Eifel,\r\nseveral species of Frog, Toad, and Newt, have been discovered. Fossil\r\nfrogs of a small species, very similar to the recent, occur in numbers\r\nin a dark shale, overlaid by basalt, in the vicinity of Bombay.[699]\r\n\r\n[699] Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. iii. p. 221.\r\n\r\nA celebrated fossil of this class is the gigantic Salamander\r\n(_Cryptobranchus_), three feet in length (_Lign. 243_), found at\r\nŒningen (see _Wond._ pp. 263, 580), which a German physician of some\r\nnote (_Scheuchzer_) supposed to be a fossil man![700] and he described\r\nit in an essay, entitled \"_Homo diluvii testis et Theoscopos_,\" as\r\nbeing the moiety, or nearly so, of a human skeleton, with the bones and\r\nflesh incorporated in the stone.[701] A fine example of this fossil\r\nSalamander is preserved in the British Museum (_Petrif._ p. 186).\r\n\r\n[700] Phil.

By far the most\r\ninteresting evidence of the existence of Batrachian reptiles in the\r\nearlier ages of our planet has been afforded by Professor Jäger’s\r\ndiscovery of the skull, teeth, and other remains of gigantic extinct\r\nanimals, allied to the Salamander, in the Upper New Red Sandstone\r\n(_Keuper_) of Wirtemberg.[702]\r\n\r\n[702] Über die Fossile Reptilien welche in Würtemberg aufgefunden\r\nworden sind, von Dr. Geo. Friedr. Jäger. 4to. Stuttgart, 1828. See also\r\nHermann von Meyer’s Notice of the Saurians of the Muschelkalk, Banter\r\nSandstein, and Keuper, _Quart. Geol. Journ._ vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 40.\r\n\r\nThese remains were referred by this eminent physician and naturalist\r\nto saurian genera, although the double condyle of the occipital bone\r\nindicated Batrachian affinities. It was reserved, however, for our\r\ndistinguished countryman, Professor Owen, to correct the error into\r\nwhich the German _savant_ had fallen,--remove the obscurity in which\r\nthe subject was involved,--determine the natural relations of the\r\noriginal,--and develope a modification of dental organization of the\r\nmost unexpected and interesting character.\r\n\r\nDr. Lloyd, of Leamington, having discovered some fossil teeth and\r\nbones in the light-coloured sandstone of the New Red, at Warwick and\r\nLeamington, submitted them to Professor Owen, who, struck with their\r\ngeneral resemblance to the teeth of the gigantic _Salamandroïdes_ of\r\nWirtemberg, instituted a microscopic examination of the British and\r\nGerman specimens. The result proved that the teeth from both localities\r\npossessed a remarkable and complicated structure, produced by the\r\nconvergence of numerous inflected folds of the external layer of cement\r\ntowards the pulp-cavity; to which, as we have already seen (p. 666),\r\na very slight approach was made in the tooth of the Ichthyosaurus,\r\nand a still closer approximation by the teeth of certain fishes\r\n(_Lepidosteus_, p. 616). From the intricate meanderings or labyrinthine\r\ninflections observable in the sections of these teeth, Professor Owen\r\nhas given the name of _Labyrinthodon_ to these extinct Batrachian\r\nreptiles, and has determined five British species; one of which (_L.\r\nJægeri_) he conceives to be identical with a species described by my\r\nfriend, Dr. Jäger.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the skeletons of these reptiles, hitherto found in\r\nWarwickshire, consist of portions of the cranium, and of the upper and\r\nlower jaws, with teeth, vertebræ, a sternum, and some of the bones of\r\nthe pelvis and the extremities. From a specimen (of _L. scutulatus_)\r\nconsisting of an aggregated group of bones, imbedded in sandstone,\r\ncomprising four vertebræ, portions of ribs, a humerus, a thigh-bone,\r\nand two leg-bones, with several small osseous scutes, it appears\r\nthat one species, at least, resembled the Crocodiles in its dermal\r\nstructure. But Professor Owen remarks, that this modification of the\r\ndermal system does not affect the claims of the Labyrinthodonts to be\r\nconsidered as Batrachians, although all the known living species of\r\nthis order are covered with a soft, lubricous, naked integument; for\r\nthe skin is the seat of the most variable characters in all animals;\r\nand the double occipital condyle, the simple lower jaw, the palatal\r\nvomerine bones, and the teeth of these fossil reptiles must be deemed\r\ndecisive of their essentially Batrachian nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the specimens of the cranium the important fact has been\r\nascertained, that the Labyrinthodonts had subterminal nostrils leading\r\nto a wide and shallow nasal cavity, which is separated by a broad\r\nand almost continuous palatal flooring from the cavity of the mouth;\r\nindicating, by its horizontal position, that the posterior apertures\r\nwere placed far behind the external nostrils; whereas in the recent\r\nair-breathing Batrachians the nasal canal is short and vertical, and\r\nthe inner apertures pierce the anterior part of the palate. The nasal\r\ncavities in the Frog are vertical; for this reptile swallows air. The\r\nLabyrinthodonts must, therefore, have breathed air like the Crocodiles,\r\nand were probably provided with well-developed ribs, and not mere\r\nrudimentary styles, as in most living Batrachians.\r\n\r\nTooth of the Labyrinthodon. _Pl. VI. fig. 3._--The tooth of the\r\nLabyrinthodon is of a conical figure, very slightly recurved, and\r\nmarked externally with shallow, fine, longitudinal strife. _Pl. VI.\r\nfig. 3^a_, represents (1/2 _nat. size_) a specimen presented to me by\r\nDr. Jäger. The tooth is implanted, by a single fang, in an alveolar\r\ngroove to which it is anchylosed. It consists of a simple central\r\npulp-cavity, surrounded by a body of dentine, which has an external\r\nthin coat of cement; and a vertical duplication or fold of this cement\r\npenetrates the substance of the tooth at each of the striæ, which are\r\narranged at intervals of about one line around the entire circumference\r\nof the tooth. The inflected folds of cement extend inwards towards the\r\ncentre, in a straight direction for about half a line, then become\r\nundulated, and finally terminate in a dilatation or loop, close to the\r\npulp-cavity, from which it is separated by a thin layer of dentine.\r\nWithin these inflections of the cement, the dentine, or tooth-bone, is\r\nsimilarly disposed; a layer of dentine lining the folds of cement, and\r\nhaving corresponding interspaces, which are filled up by the processes\r\nfrom the pulp-cavity. It is this blending of the cement and dentine\r\nin labyrinthine folds, that gives the peculiar character observable\r\nin transverse sections of the teeth. _Pl. VI. fig. 3^a_, represents\r\na transverse section of half the diameter of the tooth; the vacancy\r\nin the middle of the line at the bottom is a section of half the\r\npulp-cavity. _Fig. 3^b_ is a vertical section of a fragment near the\r\nsummit of the tooth; and _fig. 3^c_, a highly-magnified view of one of\r\nthe anfractuosities, showing a fold of cement, surrounding a fold of\r\ndentine, and in the centre of the latter the termination of a process\r\nof the pulp. The section of the tooth of the Ichthyosaurus, _Pl. VI.\r\nfig. 9_, shows the most simple modification of this structure; the\r\napparent complication of that of the Labyrinthodon arises from the\r\ninflections of the three elements of dental organization being more\r\nnumerous and diversified. But the beautiful plates and the graphic\r\ndescription of the original discoverer must be seen and perused to\r\nobtain an adequate idea of the exquisite structure of the fossil\r\nteeth; for the distribution of the extremely minute calcigerous\r\ntubes of the dentine is as diversified as that of the constituent\r\nsubstances. And even after viewing these _chefs-d’œuvres_ of structural\r\ndelineations, should the reader have an opportunity of examining a\r\ntransverse section of a tooth under the microscope, he will feel how\r\nfeebly any engraving can represent the characters of the original.[703]\r\n\r\n[703] Professor Owen’s Memoir on the Labyrinthodonts, in _Geol.

Agassiz).\r\n\r\n[704] The original of this figure of _Archegosaurus minor_ is now in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\n[705] See a notice of the researches of Goldfuss, Von Dechen, and Von\r\nMeyer in the geological and zoological history of this interesting\r\ngroup of batrachoid reptiles, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. iv. part\r\nii. (Miscell.) p. 513, _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe skull and portions of the trunk of this species (_A. Dechenii_),\r\nsee _Lign. 244_, indicate an animal three and a half feet in length.\r\nSeventeen dorsal vertebræ, imprints of the ribs, and remains of the\r\nextremities, have been collected. The jaws to beyond the orbit\r\nhave small fine conical teeth, longitudinally striated. The eye was\r\nfurnished with an osseous ring. The skin, of which a considerable part\r\nwas detached, was covered by long, narrow, wedge-shaped, horny scales,\r\narranged in rows (_Lign. 244_). The cranial bones are characterized\r\nby reticulating grooves and pittings, similar in character to the\r\nreticulate markings on the cranial bones of the Labyrinthodon, but of\r\na more delicate sculpturing. The original reptiles were quadruped; the\r\nfore and hind feet had distinct toes; but the limbs were feeble, and\r\nonly capable of swimming, or, when on land, of a slow creeping movement.\r\n\r\nThe Archegosaurus is closely allied to the Labyrinthodonts;[706] and,\r\nin the words of Professor Owen,[707] it is \"essentially Batrachian,\r\nand most nearly allied to the perennibranchiate, or lowest or most\r\nfish-like of that Order of Reptiles.\"\r\n\r\n[706] We may remark that in the opinion of Dr. Goldfuss and Von Meyer\r\n(_loc. cit._) the Labyrinthodon and the Archegosaurus are saurian\r\nforms connecting the Crocodiles and the Lizards, and representing in\r\nthe ancient fauna an arrested or \"permanent larva-condition of the\r\nloricated reptiles, as the sirens do among the recent batrachians.\"\r\nProfessor Owen’s estimation of the affinities of these genera is stated\r\nabove, and in the _note_ at p. 55, Geol.

Journ. Geol. Soc._ 1853, pp.\r\n58-67, plates ii. and iii.)--The remains of a reptile and a land-shell,\r\nresembling a _Pupa_, were discovered in 1852, by Sir C. Lyell and\r\nMr. J. W. Dawson, in the interior of an erect stamp of a fossil tree\r\n(_Sigillaria_), in the coal-measures at the South Joggins cliffs,\r\nNova Scotia. These remains were fully described by Professor Jeffries\r\nWyman, of Harvard University, U. S., and Professor Owen in the Appendix\r\nto the Memoir by Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Dawson, in the Journal of the\r\nGeological Society, vol. ix. Some of the bones were recognised as\r\nhaving a near resemblance to those of the recent _Menobranchus_ and\r\n_Menopoma_ (Perennibranchiate Batrachians, inhabiting North American\r\nfresh-waters); the sculptured cranial bones are analogous to those\r\nof the _Labyrinthodon_ and _Archegosaurus_; and the teeth have a\r\nLabyrinthodontoid structure: numerous, small, concentrically striated\r\nscutes, of an irregular oval shape, accompany the bones and teeth.\r\n\r\n[708] The _Tree-reptile of Acadia_ (Acadia being the ancient Indian\r\nname for Nova Scotia).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 244.

A series of minute biconcave vertebræ were found with the other\r\nremains in the erect tree, these, however, from their relatively small\r\nsize, and from other characteristics, are regarded by Professor Wyman\r\nas having probably belonged to some other associated reptile.\r\n\r\nThe Labyrinthodont reptiles have been regarded as characteristic of the\r\nPermian and Triassic epochs, their remains being found in Germany and\r\nEngland in rocks of that age. The commencement of the existence of this\r\nfamily of sauroid-batrachians, however, is of greater antiquity, since\r\ntheir relics also occur in the formations of the Carboniferous epoch.\r\nThe _Archegosaurus_ (p. 745), a batrachian but slightly removed from\r\nthe true Labyrinthodont type, has left its well-characterized remains\r\nin the Coal of Germany; the _Parabatrachus_, in that of Scotland;\r\nand the allied _Dendrerpeton_, in the Nova Scotian coal-field. This\r\nlast-mentioned great carboniferous formation has, however, afforded\r\nfossil evidence of the existence of the true Labyrinthodonts in the\r\nCoal-period, for some cranial bones, imbedded in a mass of Pictou\r\ncoal, lately sent to England by Mr. J. W. Dawson, and the subject\r\nof a Paper by Professor Owen, read before the Geological Society,\r\nwere demonstrated by that distinguished palæontologist to have close\r\naffinity with the corresponding parts of the skull of the Triassic\r\ngenera _Capitosaurus_ and _Metopias_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ICHNOLITES.]\r\n\r\nIchnolites (_Foot-prints on stone_). _Lign. 245._--The sandstones and\r\nmud-stones of many localities retain the track-prints of animals that\r\nhave passed along on the surface of the beds when in a soft state.\r\nThese foot-prints, or _ichnolites_, either occur as impressions on the\r\nsurface originally marked lay the animal in the act of progression,\r\nor as the reverse of such impressions, being casts _in relief_ on the\r\nunder side of the layer covering the surface originally impressed. Such\r\nindications of footsteps and trails have been noticed especially in the\r\nforest marble, a member of the Lower Oolite series, where Crustacea\r\nand Mollusks have left their markings, and in the New Red Sandstone,\r\nwhere the indications of reptilian quadrupeds and of bird-like\r\nbipeds[709] have been here and there preserved in great distinctness.\r\nTracks referable to Crustaceans have been found by Mr. W.

The most ancient reptilian ichnolites are those\r\ndiscovered by Capt. L. Brickenden[710] in the Old Red, at Cummingston,\r\nnear Elgin, which have some resemblance to the track of a club-footed\r\nChelonian (_Ly._ _fig._ 521); and those of the Devonian sandstone of\r\nSharp Mountain, Pennsylvania, discovered by Mr. I. Lea,[711] which\r\nexhibit distinct toes, and are probably allied to the Cheirotherian\r\nichnolites, about to be mentioned, as are also other ancient fossil\r\nfoot-tracks in the Carboniferous deposits[712] of Pennsylvania, which\r\nare figured and described in _Ly._ pp. 337-340.\r\n\r\n[709] See Ornithoidichnites, in chap, xviii.\r\n\r\n[710] Quart.

Geol.\r\nJourn._ vol. vii. p. 240.\r\n\r\nThe foot-prints on these strata are of several kinds; some appear to\r\nhave been produced by small reptiles and crustaceans; but the principal\r\nimprints are identical with those which have been observed in Saxony,\r\nand are referable to some large quadruped, in which the fore-feet\r\nwere of a much smaller size than the hind-feet (_Lign. 245_). From\r\na supposed resemblance of the imprints to those of a human hand,\r\nProfessor Kaup proposed the name of _Cheirotherium_, to designate the\r\nunknown animal which had left these \"footsteps on the sands of Time.\"\r\nBut since Professor Owen’s discovery, that the bones and teeth of\r\nreptiles found in similar strata in Warwickshire belong to gigantic\r\nBatrachians, and since the fore and hind-feet of the frog-tribe are\r\noften as dissimilar in size as the impressions of the _Cheirotherium_,\r\nit has been suggested, with much probability, that the foot-prints in\r\nquestion may be those of Labyrinthodonts; but until the form of the\r\nfeet of these extinct Batrachians can be ascertained, this inference\r\nmust be regarded as conjectural (_Ly._ _fig._ 331).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHEIROTHERIUM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 245.

Jardine, who has lately\r\ndescribed them in his _Ichnology of Annandale_, a splendid folio work,\r\nillustrated with full-sized lithographs, coloured after nature. They\r\nare accompanied with three other forms of footstep (_Herpetichnus_,\r\n_Batrachnis_, and _Actibatis_), one of which Sir W. Jardine regards as\r\nindicative of an animal probably of a saurian form.\r\n\r\nAt Grinsill quarry, from which the remains of the _Rhynchosaurus_ (p.\r\n712) were obtained, some small foot-prints have been observed, which,\r\nwith some probability, have been referred to that animal (_Rep. Brit.\r\nAssoc._ 1841, p. 146).\r\n\r\nA beautifully distinct series of foot-prints, with the mark of a\r\ntrailing tail, on a rippled slab from the New Red of Shrewley Common,\r\nWarwickshire, are figured and described by Strickland and Murchison\r\n(_Geol.

Brit. Assoc._ 1841, p. 191.\r\n\r\nThe fossil _Teeth of Reptiles_ are commonly found in as perfect a state\r\nof preservation as those of fishes; and require but the usual care for\r\ntheir preservation. But the collector should assiduously search for\r\nvestiges of the jaw and cranium; and it is desirable to place in the\r\nsame drawer any undetermined bones found associated with the teeth;\r\nas they may ultimately afford some clue to the nature of the original\r\nanimal. The microscopical examination of the teeth is to be conducted\r\nin the manner previously directed (p. 639); but for valuable specimens\r\nthe lapidary should be employed, and transverse sections made from near\r\nthe apex, the middle, and base of the tooth; if due care be taken,\r\nseveral slices may be obtained from one specimen. I have ten slices\r\nfrom one tooth of the Labyrinthodon. The bones imbedded in limestone\r\ngenerally partake of the chemical character of the rock, and are\r\noften permeated with calcareous spar; mere fragments, when polished,\r\nfrequently display the internal structure.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions for repairing fossil bones (p. 46) render further\r\ninstructions on that head unnecessary; and the description of the\r\ndevelopment of the specimen of Hylæosaurus (p. 689) affords a practical\r\nlesson to the young collector.\r\n\r\nWhen a vertebra is found in an imperfect state, it should be closely\r\nexamined on the spot, and, if it present proofs of recent fracture, the\r\ndetached processes should be sought for; even if the body of a vertebra\r\nbe imbedded in stone, and the processes appear to have been broken off\r\nbefore it was enveloped in the rock, the corresponding parts will often\r\nbe found in the same mass of stone. There is in the British Museum a\r\nvery fine Saurian vertebra imbedded in a large slab of Tilgate stone,\r\nin which the spinous process is seen lying in the same block, several\r\ninches distant from the centrum or body; when observed in the quarry\r\nthe latter only was exposed, and I was about to detach it from the\r\nslab, for the convenience of carriage, when I perceived indications of\r\nthe spinous process. The vertebra was therefore allowed to remain, and\r\nthe stone chiselled away, so as to expose the spine; and the specimen\r\nthen displayed its present interesting character.\r\n\r\nIt may frequently happen that a fragment of a large bone,--as, for\r\nexample, the thigh-bone of the Iguanodon,--may be obtained from a\r\nquarry; and after an interval of some weeks the corresponding portions\r\nbe discovered. This was remarkably exemplified in the first specimen\r\nwhich revealed to me the peculiar characters of the femur of the\r\nIguanodon. The lower part, or condyloid extremity, of a gigantic\r\nbone, firmly impacted in a block of Tilgate-grit, was found in a\r\nquarry near Cuckfield; it was evidently but a fragment of the fossil,\r\nfor the fracture was recent; I therefore requested the quarry-men\r\nto make diligent search for the corresponding portion, but without\r\nsuccess. Several months afterwards, upon a fresh explosion in the\r\nquarry, the head of a large bone was found loose among the fallen\r\nmass; but there were no indications that it belonged to the specimen\r\npreviously found; and it was regarded as another relic of some one\r\nof the colossal animals whose bones were distributed in the Wealden\r\ndeposits. Teeth, fragments of bones, and other fossils were from\r\ntime to time obtained from the same quarry; and among these a huge\r\nquadrangular fragment of bone, similar to the enormous mass that had so\r\nlong been in my possession, and had defied all attempts to ascertain\r\nits character.[718] It was some time before it occurred to me, that\r\nthe three portions of unknown colossal bone might belong to the same\r\nspecimen; but eventually they were found to correspond, and upon\r\ncementing them together, the femur of the Iguanodon was, for the first\r\ntime, developed.\r\n\r\n[718] The fragment alluded to is figured, _Foss. Til. For._ pl. xviii.\r\n\r\nThe figures in _Lign. 206_ will assist the collector in recognising\r\nthe different vertebral processes, even when occurring as detached\r\nfragments. When specimens are evidently rolled or water-worn, there\r\nis, of course, no probability that the corresponding portions will be\r\nmet with. Every fragment of a bone the nature of which is not obvious\r\nshould be carefully preserved; for sooner or later its characters may\r\nbe ascertained. It is scarcely necessary again to remind the collector,\r\nthat search should be made for indications of the soft parts around the\r\nbones; the specimen of the paddle of the Ichthyosaurus (_Lign. 215_, p.\r\n669), with its integument, must have impressed this fact too strongly\r\non the mind to be soon forgotten. If the impression of the extremities\r\nof a bone, of which a fragment only remains, be observed, the block of\r\nstone should be preserved, as a cast may be taken, and the entire form\r\nof the original be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL REPTILES.\r\n\r\n  Aust Cliff, near Bristol. _Lias._ Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Barrow-on-Soar. _Lias._ Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\n  Bath. _Lias._ Plesiosaurus.\r\n\r\n  Battle, Sussex. _Wealden._ Iguanodon, Cetiosaurus, Goniopholis,\r\n    Chelonians.\r\n\r\n  Binstead, Isle of Wight. _Upper Eocene._ Fresh-water Tortoises.\r\n    Bognor.

In the caverns that\r\ncontain the skeletons of carnivorous animals, and which in many\r\ncases were once their dens, the bones of several species of existing\r\ngenera of Birds have been discovered, in England, on the Continent,\r\nin America, and in Australia; and recently there have been obtained\r\nfrom alluvial deposits in New Zealand the skeletons of Birds, some\r\nof enormous magnitude, and under conditions which leave some doubt\r\nwhether, like the _Dodo_, the species may not have been extirpated by\r\nman during the last few centuries; or even if some stray individuals of\r\nthe race may not, according to the belief of the aborigines, be still,\r\nin existence in the interior of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom the gypsum quarries at Montmartre, near Paris, Baron Cuvier\r\nobtained several species of Ornitholites; and Prof. Owen has described\r\nthe relics of three or four species from the London Clay: these fossil\r\nbirds of the eocene tertiary deposits are the most ancient relics\r\nof this class known to the geologist, with the exception of the\r\nfoot-prints on the _New Red_ sandstone of North America, that have been\r\nreferred to animals of this class.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of the remains of Birds may probably in some measure\r\nbe attributable, as Sir C. Lyell has suggested, to the peculiar\r\norganization of these animals; for their power of flight necessarily\r\nrenders them less liable to be engulphed and imbedded in the deltas of\r\nrivers or in the bed of the ocean, than quadrupeds; and the lightness\r\nof their structure, occasioned by their tubular bones and feathery\r\ndermal integument, generally prevents the sinking of the bodies of such\r\nas die on, or fall into, the water; so that their carcases are devoured\r\nor decomposed.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this subject, I purpose, in the _first_ place, to\r\nexplain such peculiarities in the osteology of the animals of this\r\nclass, as may assist the collector in the identification of their\r\nfossil remains; _secondly_, to take a cursory survey of the geological\r\ndistribution of fossil Birds, and examine a few of the most interesting\r\nexamples; and _lastly_, consider the striking phenomena presented\r\nby the foot-prints of supposed Birds on the strata of those ancient\r\ndeposits which are comprised in the _Trias_ or New Red formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OSTEOLOGY OF BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nI. Osteological Characters.--The skull in adult birds presents this\r\nremarkable feature, that it is composed of but one bone without any\r\ntrace of suture: the osseous tissue is very compact; the bone is\r\nwhite, and very smooth externally. The lower jaw is formed, as in\r\nreptiles, of several bones, namely, articular, angular, supra-angular,\r\nand dental; it is united to the skull by the intervention of a bone\r\n(_os quadratum_), as in certain reptiles. Both jaws are destitute of\r\nteeth, and are protected by dense horny sheaths, which form powerful\r\ndentary organs. The vertebral column of the neck is exceedingly\r\nflexible, and is composed of a greater number of bones than in any\r\nother living animals; for the cervical vertebæ, which in the mammalia\r\namount to seven, in birds vary from ten to twenty-four, as in the\r\nSwan. To admit of this extreme mobility of the neck without injury to\r\nthe enclosed spinal cord, the annular part, or neural arch, of each\r\ncervical vertebra is enlarged at the extremities that form a junction\r\nwith the corresponding bones; thus presenting a modification of\r\nvertebral development directly the reverse of that possessed by the\r\nextinct saurian of the Magnesian conglomerate (see p. 714). The dorsal\r\nand sacra vertebral, on the contrary, are firmly interlocked, and\r\noften anchylosed together, and constitute a strong, inflexible pillar\r\nto afford a fixed point of support to the powerful locomotive organs\r\nof flight. There are no _lumbar_, or rib-less vertebræ. The sacrum\r\noften consists of eighteen, twenty, or more vertebræ, anchylosed into\r\na solid bone. In the young Ostrich the vertebræ may be found separate\r\nand distinct; and the neural arch is shifted to the union of two\r\nvertebræ, as in the _Megalosaurus_. The sacral spinal cord is almost\r\nas large as the brain; to supply the large muscles. The foramina for\r\nthe passage of the nerves are double, one for the sensitive, and the\r\nother for the motive root, which pass out separately and unite in. a\r\nganglion externally. The ribs are formed so as to combine strength with\r\nlightness in the construction of the walls of the chest, for each rib\r\nhas a _recurrent apophysis_, or process, that extends backwards, and\r\nglides over the contiguous bone; this is a very peculiar and obvious\r\ncharacter.[719] The ribs are united in front to the sternum by bony\r\nprocesses, analogous to the _costal-arcs_ of the Plesiosaurus. The\r\npectoral arch is distinguished by the prominent longitudinal keel or\r\ncrest of the sternum; a structure designed to give attachment to the\r\npowerful pectoral muscles which move the wings, and which presents\r\ncharacteristic modifications in the different orders; and by the\r\npeculiar bone, termed the _furcula_, or merry-thought, which connects\r\nthe clavicles. The clavicles are strongest and most open in birds of\r\nstrongest flight. The coracoids (in birds) relate to respiration, and\r\nserve to admit of contraction and expansion of the sternum and abdomen.\r\nThe bones of the anterior extremities are modified to adapt these\r\ninstruments for the purposes of flight, and those of the fore-arm\r\n(_radius_ and _ulna_) are very long, and firmly united together; the\r\nulna has a row of slight eminences for the attachment of the quills\r\nof the secondary feathers. The wrist, or _carpus_, is composed of but\r\ntwo bones, articulated to the radius and ulna, and which admit only\r\nof a _lateral_ movement, by which the wings are folded close to the\r\nbody. The bones of the hinder extremities consist of the thigh or\r\n_femur_;[720] the leg-bones, _tibia_[721] and _fibula_, the latter very\r\nsmall and anchylosed to the former; and of a single shank-bone, which\r\nsupplies the place of the tarsal and metatarsal bones of other animals.\r\nThis bone is articulated at its upper extremity to the tibia, and\r\nterminates at the lower end in distinct processes, which correspond in\r\nnumber with the toes; each process having a groove for the pulley-like\r\ntendon that moves the corresponding toe. This construction is peculiar\r\nto birds; for although in some quadrupeds, as the horse for example,\r\nthe metatarsus consists of but one piece, the tarsus is composed of\r\nseveral bones.\r\n\r\n[719] In very old crocodiles an analogous apophysis, which is\r\ngenerally cartilaginous, is sometimes found, ossified (_Owen_).\r\n\r\n[720] The acetabulum, or socket for the head of the thigh-bone, is\r\nalways perforated. The femur has a surface for the articulation of\r\nthe fibula; and by this character the femur of all birds may be\r\ndistinguished. There is always a _patella_.\r\n\r\n[721] The lower end of the tibia is very like that of the femur.\r\n\r\nThe toes of birds present deviations equally recognisable; for the\r\nnumber of the articulations (or _phalangeal_ pieces of bone) in each\r\ntoe is different. Thus the thumb, or short toe, has _two_ bones; the\r\nfirst toe on the inner side _three_; the the middle toe _four_; and\r\nthe outer toe _five_. In general, three toes are directed forwards,\r\nand one backwards. In some species, the thumb or opposable toe is\r\naltogether wanting; in others, as in the swallow, it is directed\r\nforwards; in climbing birds, both the outer and the back toe are\r\nsituated behind. The position of the hind toe, therefore, affords an\r\nimportant indication of the habits of the bird (see _Wond._ p. 146,\r\n_Lign. 23_), and from a fragment of the lower extremity of the shank\r\nor tarso-metatarsal bone, with any trace of this articulation, we may\r\ndetermine whether the individual to which it belonged was a climber,\r\nwader, &c. In the toes of Crocodiles alone, the number of joints is\r\nthe same as in birds; but in these reptiles, each toe is supported\r\nby a distinct metatarsal bone. The osteological peculiarities above\r\nenumerated may assist the collector in arriving at some general\r\ninferences as to the nature of any fossil remains of birds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nII. Ornitholites, or Fossil Birds.--The fossil remains of birds consist\r\nin general of their osseous skeletons, and of detached bones, and\r\nrarely of the feathers and eggs.\r\n\r\nPleistocene Epoch.--Bones of the Dodo[722] (see _Wond._ p. 131), a bird\r\nwhich appears to have become extinct by human agency within the last\r\ntwo centuries, have been found, associated with the remains of a recent\r\nspecies of Tortoise, beneath a bed of lava in the Isle of France. And\r\nin some caverns in the island of Rodriguez, the bones of one or more\r\nlarge birds allied to the Dodo have also been discovered.\r\n\r\n[722] See Penny Cyclopædia, _Art._ Dodo, and the beautiful work on the\r\nnatural history of the Dodo and its Kindred, by the late lamented Mr.\r\nStrickland and Dr. Melville, 4to.\r\n\r\nDinornis (_fearfully great bird_). _Pict. Atlas_, frontispiece, and p.\r\n172--Numerous bones of large extinct birds have been obtained in New\r\nZealand by Mr. Rule, the Rev. W. Williams, Col. Wakefield, Mr. Walter\r\nMantell, and others. These have been referred by Professor Owen to\r\ntridactylous struthious birds (one of which was one-third larger than\r\nthe African ostrich), resembling the living _Apteryx_ of New Zealand\r\n(_Wond._ p. 128, _Petrif._ p. 106) in the proportions of the tibia to the\r\nmetatarsus, and also in the rudimental state of the wings. The bones\r\nare found in the recent alluvium, but probably in some cases at least\r\nthey have been washed by the streams from older alluvial deposits.\r\n\r\nAn account of the history of the discovery of the gigantic Moa’s bones\r\nin New Zealand (_Wond._ p. 129) is given in full in _Petrif._ p. 93,\r\n_et seq._; and the scientific description of the various parts of\r\nthe skeleton of the Dinornis and Palapteryx, chiefly collected from\r\nProfessor Owen’s elaborate and finely illustrated memoirs in the\r\nTransactions of the Zoological Society, should be consulted, _Petrif._\r\np. 108, &c. Of _Dinornis_ Professor Owen discriminates seven or eight\r\nspecies; of _Palapteryx_, three species; and indications of a species\r\nof a third associated genus, Aptornis.\r\n\r\nFragments of egg-shell accompany these interesting relics of birds\r\nfrom New Zealand. From Madagascar also bird-bones and eggs have\r\nbeen obtained in a fossil state, that indicate the original bird\r\n(_Æpyornis_) to have been even of a greater size than the Dinornis.\r\n\r\nOrnitholites of the Caverns.--Many limestone districts abound in\r\nfissures and caves, which vary in extent from more superficial hollows\r\nto deep excavations and caverns of considerable magnitude (_Wond._ p.\r\n175, &c.) Beneath the stalagmitic or sparry floors of some of these\r\ncaverns, the bones of extinct species of Cats, Bears, and Hyænas, occur\r\nin immense quantities; but the full consideration of these phenomena\r\nwill be reserved for the next chapter. The skeletons and detached bones\r\nof several kinds of Birds are often found imbedded with these remains;\r\nand under circumstances which seem to indicate that they were brought\r\ninto these caverns as prey by the carnivora, with whose relics they are\r\nnow associated. Some examples show that the birds had fallen into the\r\nfissure; others, that their bones had been transported to their present\r\nsituation by the action of water.\r\n\r\nIn the Cave of Kirkdale, in Yorkshire (_Wond._ p. 179), Dr. Buckland\r\nfound bones of the Raven, Lark, Pigeon, Duck, and others; and as almost\r\nall the specimens were the remains of wing-bones, it is considered\r\nprobable that they are the relics of dead birds, which had been brought\r\ninto the cave by the hyænas, whose den it is supposed to have been for\r\na considerable period (_Reliquiæ Diluvianæ_, p. 34).\r\n\r\nSimilar remains have been discovered in the Kent’s Hole cavern, and in\r\nthat at Berry Head, Torbay; from the latter Professor Owen has obtained\r\nthe wing-bones of a Falcon (_Brit. Fos. Mam. and Birds_, p. 558).\r\n\r\nIn France, the Lunel-Viel caverns have yielded a few bird-bones; and\r\nmany such remains occur in the caves of Brazil, described by M. Lund.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"bone-breccia\" of the coasts and islands of the\r\nMediterranean (_Wond._ p. 185) contains frequent remains of birds: they\r\nhave been especially noticed at Cette, Nice, Sardinia, and Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the deposits especially referred to the northern drift or\r\nBoulder-clay period, fossil birds appear to be very rare, although the\r\nremains of vertebrate terrestrial animals are locally abundant. Dr.\r\nBuckland states that some bones, apparently of a species of goose,\r\nfound at Lawford, with the remains of Hyæna, Elephant, Rhinoceros, &c.,\r\nis the only instance he has met with of fossil birds in the drift of\r\nEngland (_Reliq. Diluv._ p. 27).\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, bird-bones have been found, at Quedlingbourg,\r\nMeissen, and in the Lahn Valley, in deposits said to be of this age.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrnitholites of the older Tertiary Deposits. (_Lign. 246._)--The\r\nvery rich pliocene deposits at Œningen (p. 559) have afforded a few\r\nfragments of birds’ bones.\r\n\r\nThree or four species of Ornitholites (Duck, Heron, Flamingo, &c.),\r\nand several examples of the eggs of birds, have been discovered in\r\nthe lacustrine strata of Auvergne. Birds’ bones also occur in the\r\nfresh-water limestone near Issoire, in the Buy de Dôme, associated\r\nwith the remains of eocene mammalia. In Germany, bird-bones have been\r\nfound in tertiary deposits at Wiesbaden, Wiesnau, and Mornbach. In\r\nthe Siwalik Hills the remains of birds are associated with the fossil\r\nreptilia and mammalia, to which reference has already been made (p.\r\n731).\r\n\r\nFrom the quarries of gypseous limestone of Montmartre, near Paris,\r\nBaron Cuvier obtained many bones, and some connected portions of the\r\nskeletons of several birds related to the Pelican, Sea-lark, Curlew,\r\nWoodcock, Owl, Buzzard, and Quail.[723] In several of these examples\r\nthere are the imprints and remains of the quills and feathers; in some\r\nthe skeleton has perished, and a pellicle of dark-brown substance, with\r\nthe configuration of the original, alone remains (see _Lign. 246_).\r\nThese Ornitholites are associated with the bones of the Palæotheria,\r\nand other extinct mammalia of the eocene period. Two or three\r\nOrnitholites have been discovered at Montmartre, in which almost the\r\nentire skeleton is preserved. In one example, described by Cuvier,\r\nthe remains of a bird are displayed in such a manner as to render it\r\nprobable that the animal had fallen on its belly, and become partially\r\nimpacted in the surface of the soft gypsum, which is now become solid\r\nstone; and that, previously to its being completely enveloped, the\r\nprincipal part of its head and the left leg were removed either by\r\nsome voracious animal, or by the action of the water. In addition to\r\nthe other parts of the skeleton, the under side of the bill is very\r\ndistinctly impressed on the stone, and the left branch is entire; there\r\nare also the remains of the cellular basis of the skull; and both the\r\nwings are well preserved. Nine or ten species of fossil birds were\r\nidentified by Cuvier from the Paris eocene strata.\r\n\r\n[723] Ossemens Fossiles, tom. iii. p. 302, plates lxxii.--lxxv.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL VULTURE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 246.

These relics present a close agreement with the corresponding\r\nbones of the Vulture tribe, but indicate a smaller species of Vulture\r\nthan any now known to exist.\r\n\r\nIn his \"History of British Fossil Mammalia and Birds,\" 1846, Professor\r\nOwen has also described another sacrum from the Sheppey Clay, a\r\n_sternum_ from Primrose Hill, and the _cranium_ of a bird, probably\r\nof the _Halcyonidæ_ family, from the same eocene deposit at Sheppey.\r\nThis has also yielded a portion of shank-bone, which, according to Mr.\r\nBowerbank, indicates a bird of the size of a full-grown albatross.\r\nBrit. Assoc. 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome few specimens of cylindrical bones from the Chalk and the\r\nWealden[724] have been previously referred to Birds, and described\r\nas remains of species of that family. These fossils, however, have\r\nlately been reexamined in comparison with more perfect bones of similar\r\ncharacter; and, with the exception of a few, the structure of which\r\ndecidedly has the characters belonging to bird’s bone, the result of\r\nthis investigation has assigned them to Pterodactyles.[725] The long\r\nthin cylindrical bones from the Stonesfield Oolite are probably all\r\nPterodactylian also, as suggested by the late Mr. Miller.\r\n\r\n[724] One fragment of a bone, apparently of an _ulna_, retained a row\r\nof small eminences, probably the points of attachment for the quills of\r\nthe secondary feathers of the wings. This specimen would appear to have\r\na decided reference to ornithic structure, but it was transferred to\r\nthe British Museum, and is not now to be seen.\r\n\r\n[725] See _Quart. Geol. Journ._ vol. ii. p. 96, &c.; and Owen’s\r\n_Monograph on Chalk Reptiles_, 1851, p. 80, _et seq._ It is to be\r\nhoped that the eminent microscopists, Mr. Bowerbank and Professor\r\nQuekett, may be enabled before long to elucidate the intimate structure\r\nof pterodactylian bone; which, although of an essentially reptilian\r\ntype, has characters of its own, offering some resemblances to\r\nbird-structure, that have not yet been fully described. Some specimens\r\nof bones from the Wealden (for instance, the specimen figured in\r\n_Geol. Trans._ 2d ser. vol. v. pl. xiii. _fig._ 6, and _Geol. Journ._\r\nvol. iv. pl. i. _fig._ 9,) exhibit under the microscope an intimate\r\nstructure resembling that seen in bird-bone, in contradistinction\r\nto that characteristic of reptilian bone. But until we are better\r\nacquainted with the microscopic structure of the osseous tissue of\r\nthe Pterosaurians, and are in possession of more perfect specimens of\r\nbones, it cannot be satisfactorily determined to what extent the class\r\nof Birds existed in the country of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORNITHOIDICHNITES.]\r\n\r\nIII.

S. seems to prove that numerous bird-like bipeds,\r\nand some of gigantic size, existed at the period when the Triassic\r\nor _New Red_ strata were in the progress of formation; that period,\r\nas the reader will remember, in which the Labyrinthodonts and other\r\nextraordinary reptiles flourished. _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1841, p. 230,\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[726] See \"Illustrations of Fossil Foot-prints of the Valley of the\r\nConnecticut,\" 1849, 4to. with nine plates.\r\n\r\nIn certain localities of the New Red sandstone in the valley of the\r\nConnecticut, numerous tridactyle markings had been occasionally\r\nobserved on the surfaces of the slabs of stone when split asunder,\r\nin like manner as the ripple-marks appear on the successive layers\r\nof sandstone in Corncockle Muir, Tilgate Forest, &c. Some remarkable\r\ndistinct impressions of this kind at Turner’s Falls (Massachusetts)\r\nhappening to attract the attention of Dr. Deane, that sagacious\r\nobserver was struck with their resemblance to the foot-marks left\r\non the mud-banks of the adjacent river by the aquatic birds which\r\nhad recently frequented the spot. The conviction that the imprints\r\non the stone were referable to a similar origin with those on the\r\nmud was so strongly impressed on his mind, that he immediately\r\ncollected a series of specimens, and communicated his discovery and\r\nopinion to Professor E. Hitchcock, who followed up the inquiry with\r\na zeal and success that have led to the most interesting results.\r\nNo reasonable doubt now exists that the imprints in question have\r\nbeen produced by the tracks of bipeds, impressed on the stone when\r\nin a soft state. The announcement of this extraordinary phenomenon\r\nwas first made by Professor Hitchcock, in the American Journal of\r\nScience (January, 1836); and that eminent geologist has subsequently\r\npublished full descriptions of the different species of imprints\r\nwhich he has detected, with excellent lithographs, in his \"Geology of\r\nMassachusetts.\" (See _Petrif._ pp. 64-73.)\r\n\r\nThree highly interesting specimens of the Ornithoidichnites of North\r\nAmerica, collected and developed by Dr. James Deane, have been lately\r\nadded to the collection of organic remains in the British Museum. They\r\nexhibit several varieties of the foot-prints, and are in a very fine\r\nstate of preservation. The surface of the largest slab is eight feet\r\nby six, and bears upwards of seventy distinct impressions, disposed\r\nin several tracks, as shown in the _Lign. 247_. The direction and\r\ndisposition of the foot-tracks are rendered more distinct by the lines\r\ndrawn from one imprint to another in the consecutive series.\r\n\r\nThe principal tracks on this slab, _Lign. 247_, are as follow;\r\n\r\n Fig. 1 to 1, directed from below upwards, is a track consisting of six\r\n               large footsteps.\r\n\r\n      2 to 2, from above downwards; a track of four foot-prints, disposed\r\n               almost in a right line, and very far apart.\r\n\r\n      3 to 3, a track of five foot-prints, from above downwards, of a\r\n               large, heavy animal, like fig. 1.\r\n\r\n      4 to 4, from above downwards, four foot-prints like _fig._ 2,\r\n               disposed in a nearly straight track, and far apart.\r\n\r\n           5, a track of five heavy foot-prints, directed obliquely\r\n               upwards.\r\n\r\n      6 to 6, five foot-prints of a large biped, in a track from below\r\n               upwards.\r\n\r\n           7, a series of five delicate foot-prints.\r\n\r\n      8 to 8, a track of eleven very small foot-prints, disposed in\r\n               zigzag, and extending obliquely from the right extremity\r\n               to the upper edge of  the slab.\r\n\r\n      9 to 9, a track of four large and distant foot-prints, passing\r\n               obliquely across the stone from left to right.\r\n\r\nI subjoin also a representation of one of the smaller foot-prints, of\r\nthe natural size, the surface of the stone being sprinkled also with\r\nhemispherical markings produced by drops of rain.

A few shapeless fragments of\r\nbones are the only vestiges of the skeletons of any animals, with the\r\nexception of fishes, that have been found in the strata which have\r\nfurnished the slabs of Ornithoidichnites. Some Coprolites also have\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 248.

Journ. of Science, (1843,) vol. xlvi. p. 73.]]\r\n\r\nThe enormous size of some of the foot-marks is calculated to excite\r\ngreat surprise. I have in my possession (through the kindness of Dr.\r\nDeane) imprints that prove the size of the foot to have been fifteen\r\ninches in length, and ten inches in width, exclusive of the hind\r\nclaw, which is present in some species, and is here two inches long.\r\nThe foot-prints of this biped when in a consecutive series of five\r\nor six, are from four to six feet apart; which, of course, must have\r\nbeen the length of the stride; the longest stride was probably made\r\nby the animal when running; the shortest, when walking at a moderate\r\npace. These footsteps indicate proportions so far exceeding those\r\nof all known living bipeds,--for the foot of the African ostrich is\r\nbut ten inches long,--that the geologist may be pardoned for having\r\nhesitated to adopt the opinions of the American savans, in the absence\r\nof any relics of the osseous structure of the supposed birds; although\r\nsanctioned by the high authority of Dr. Buckland, who, from the first,\r\nconcurred in the views of Professor Hitchcock (_Bd._ ii. p. 39): but\r\nthis objection has been in a great measure removed by the discovery of\r\nthe remains of the gigantic Moa or Dinornis of New Zealand, with feet\r\nequal in magnitude to the largest of the Connecticut foot-prints. See\r\np. 763, and _Pict. Atlas_, frontispiece. Professor Hitchcock is of\r\nopinion that upwards of forty species of these biped foot-prints may be\r\ndistinguished. Foot-prints referable to chelonians, batrachians, and\r\nlizards are associated with the above.[727]\r\n\r\n[727] Trans. Amer. Phil. Soc. n. s. vol. x. pt. ii. p. 312.\r\n\r\nIn the New Red Sandstone of Stourton Hill, near Liverpool, Mr.\r\nCunningham has observed tridactylous, webbed foot-prints,[728] 2-1/2\r\ninches long, which he refers to a bird; Mr. Hawkshaw also noticed\r\nsome bird-like tracks at Lymm; and Professor Harkness met with a trace\r\nof a biped at Weston Point, near Runcorn. These appear to be the only\r\nindications of ornithoidichnites in the Trias of England; and these are\r\nvery obscure.\r\n\r\n[728] These are accompanied by cheirotherian prints, and by the\r\ncast of an impression quite similar to that made on the sands of the\r\nsea-beach of to day, by the Medusa (sea-nettle or jelly-fish) left by\r\nthe reflux of the tide and exposed to a few hours of sunshine. Mr.\r\nCunningham and Mr. Pidgeon have furnished a figure of this interesting\r\nimpression of the \"jelly-fish,\" which has left \"the solid memorial of\r\nits evanescent existence en the ancient strand\" of the Triassic sea,\r\nshowing that the physical conditions of land, water, and atmosphere\r\nwere the same then as those that now obtain.--_Liverpool Lit. Phil.\r\nSoc. Proc._ 1848, p. 128, _fig._ 1. A similar imprint on a Jurassic\r\nrock in Germany is referred to at p. 280.\r\n\r\nIn the Wealden of Hastings and the Isle of Wight, the natural casts of\r\nlarge tridactylous foot-prints have been observed by Mr. Taggart and\r\nMr. Beckles (see _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. ii. p. 267, vol. vii.\r\np. 117, vol. viii. p. 396, and _Geol. Isle of Wight_, p. 328), but as\r\nyet no solution of the mystery at present enwrapping these gigantic,\r\ntridactylous, biped (?) ichnolites has presented itself: we only know\r\nthat the creature that left them traversed the borders of the mighty\r\nriver which floated down the bulky carcases of the Hylæosaur and\r\nIguanodon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nOn Collecting the Fossil Remains of Birds.--Notwithstanding the extreme\r\nrarity of fossils of this class, the student should not be discouraged\r\nin his search for the remains of Birds in the secondary rocks. That\r\nfar more instructive specimens than any that have fallen under my\r\nobservation may be discovered in the Wealden strata by diligent\r\nresearch, there can be no reasonable doubt. It is also very probable\r\nthat the Stonesfield slate, which abounds in remains of terrestrial\r\nplants and animals, will be found to contain Ornitholites. It is\r\nimportant for the collector to bear in mind, that when only a fragment\r\nof the shaft of a bone remains imbedded in the stone, if the imprint\r\nof the other portions be preserved, he may obtain a knowledge of the\r\nform of the extremities; in the same manner as the external markings\r\nof the surface of a shell may be ascertained, when the shell itself is\r\nlost or destroyed, and a smooth stony cast of the internal cavity only\r\nis left. The same remark will apply to the bones of reptiles and other\r\nanimals; for example, a perfect leg-bone may be imbedded in a block of\r\nlimestone; but, when exposed by breaking the stone, a portion of the\r\nshaft may alone remain attached, and both extremities be shattered to\r\npieces by the concussion of the blow; yet, if the impression remains,\r\nthe entire form of the original may be determined.\r\n\r\nThe _foot-prints_, not only of birds, but of reptiles and other animals,\r\nshould be diligently sought for on the surfaces of laminated strata of\r\nsand and clay, and especially where the presence of ripple-marks, and\r\nthe impressions of rain-drops, indicate that the beds were deposited in\r\nshallow water. The forest-marble flags at Castle Comb, north of Bath,\r\nthe Stonesfield slates, and the sandstones around Horsham (in Sussex),\r\nand particularly at Stammerham (see _Geol. S. E._ p. 213), are often\r\nrippled, and it is therefore probable that the foot-prints of some of\r\nthe Oolitic and Wealden quadrupeds and bipeds, if such existed, will\r\nsooner or later be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFOSSIL MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remains of Mammalia discovered in a fossil state include an immense\r\nnumber of species, and furnish examples of almost every living genus,\r\nand of numerous genera, and even orders, of which no existing species\r\nare known. Yet amidst the vast accumulations of the skeletons of the\r\nhigher orders of vertebrata contained in the tertiary deposits, and in\r\nthe superficial drift, belonging to species which have successively\r\nappeared on the surface of our planet, flourished for indefinite\r\nperiods of time, and then become annihilated, no vestiges of Man, or\r\nof his works, have been detected. Human skeletons, naturally imbedded,\r\nhave hitherto only been observed in the silt of modern alluvial\r\nplains,[729] in peat-bogs (_Wond._ p. 64), and in conglomerates\r\nof recent date, such as are in the progress of formation on the\r\nsea-shores, particularly where the water is loaded with the detritus of\r\nshells and corals, and the waves transport the calcareous matter along\r\nthe margins of creeks and bays, or deposit it in the shallows along the\r\ncoast (see _Wond._ p. 87, and _Petrif._ p. 483).\r\n\r\n[729] There seems, however, reason to believe that the human skulls\r\nand bones found with elephantine and other remains in the Alps of\r\nSwabia, are of contemporaneous origin with these extinct mammals. (See\r\n_Literary Gazette_, 1853, p. 1027.)\r\n\r\nThe geological distribution of fossil mammalia,[730]--the occurrence of\r\nthe entire carcases of extinct species of Elephant and Rhinoceros in\r\nblocks of ice (_Wond._ p. 151),--of recent species in the superficial\r\nalluvial clay and silt,--of recent and extinct forms in the Drift or\r\nPleistocene deposits (_Wond._ p. 147),--of the gradual preponderance\r\nof unknown species and genera, in proportion as we carry back our\r\nretrospect to the most ancient Tertiary strata (_Wond._ p. 254),\r\n--the sudden disappearance of all vestiges of the entire Class of\r\nMammalia, with the last bed of the Eocene deposits,--with the exception\r\nof a few minute jaws in one set of beds of the Oolite in England\r\n(_Wond._ p. 510), and of a few teeth in the Trias (?) of Germany,[731]\r\nthe sole records of the existence of any of the highest types of\r\nanimal organization throughout the vast periods of the secondary\r\nformations--are so fully treated of in the _Wonders of Geology_, that I\r\nneed not dwell upon the subject in the present volumes. Neither is it\r\ndesirable to enter at large upon this department of Palæontology, for\r\nit were vain to attempt the elucidation of the anatomical characters\r\nof but one extinct species of Mammalia, without giving details of\r\nstructure, that could only be successfully demonstrated in a work\r\nexpressly devoted to the subject. Referring, therefore, to Cuvier’s\r\n_Ossemens Fossiles_, and to Professor Owen’s \"_History of the British\r\nFossil Mammalia_,\" 8vo. 1846, I must limit my remarks on the Fossil\r\nMammalia to a brief summary of modern discoveries, with suggestions for\r\nthe identification and collection of some of the most interesting or\r\nprevalent remains.\r\n\r\n[730] For a notice of the distribution of mammalian remains in the\r\nUpper Tertiaries of Europe, see Phillips’s _Geology_, 1853, vol. i. p.\r\n45, &c.\r\n\r\n[731] For an account of these teeth of small insectivorous mammals from\r\nthe \"bone-bed\" of Würtemberg, which has an analogous position at the\r\ntop of the Trias with the \"bone-bed\" of Axmouth and Aust Cliff, see\r\n_Ly._ p. xiv. figs. 529-531.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of Mammalia will be considered under the following\r\nheads:--\r\n\r\n   I. Cetacea, or animals of the _Whale tribe_.\r\n\r\n  II. Ruminantia; including the _Camel_, _Giraffe_, _Deer_,\r\n          _Sheep_, _Ox_, &c.\r\n\r\n III.

Edentata: animals without teeth, or with only\r\n          molars, as the _Ant-eater_, _Sloth_, _Megatherium_, _Mylodon_,\r\n          &c.\r\n\r\n   V.

Bimana; or _Man_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL WHALES.]\r\n\r\nI. Fossil Cetacea.[732]--The _Cetaceans_, although popularly termed\r\nfishes, are as perfect air-breathing vertebrated animals, as the\r\nterrestrial mammalia, and, like them, give suck to their young. Instead\r\nof fore-feet or arms, they have a pair of fins or paddles, but are\r\ndestitute of hinder extremities, the place of the latter organs being\r\nsupplied by a powerful cartilaginous horizontal fin, appended to the\r\ntail. The Cetaceans, therefore, differ in this respect from the fossil\r\nmarine reptiles, the Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus (see p. 662), which\r\nhave two pairs of paddles. This order, as is well known, comprises\r\nthe most colossal forms of animal existence,--the Whales. Some are\r\nherbivorous, others carnivorous; many have powerful teeth; others are\r\nedentulous, the jaw being furnished with a series of elongate plates of\r\nthe substance familiarly known by the name of _whale-bone_.\r\n\r\n[732] _Cetacea_: an order of aquatic mammalia, comprising the W hales,\r\nNarwhals, Porpoises, Dolphins, and Dugongs.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of Cetaceans have, for the most part, been observed\r\nin alluvial silt and beds of drift, in valleys still traversed by\r\nrivers; but many examples have been discovered in elevated sea-beaches,\r\nproving that, although, geologically speaking, these beds are of\r\nmodern origin, yet great changes in the relative level of the land and\r\nsea must have taken place since these remains were imbedded. Thus, on\r\nthe banks of the river Forth, near Alloa, in Scotland, the skeleton of\r\na Whale (_Balænoptera_), seventy-two feet long, was discovered imbedded\r\nin clay, twenty feet above the highest tide.[733] Cuvier mentions\r\nthe discovery of bones of a _Lamantin_ at Angers; of a Dolphin,\r\nand Rorqual, in Lombardy; and of a Grampus, in the pliocene of the\r\nSub-Apennines.[734]\r\n\r\n[733] Dr. Fleming’s _British Animals_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[734] For notices and descriptions of Cetacean remains found in\r\nEngland, see Owen’s _Brit.

On the\r\nface of the Cliff, in the ancient shingle which lies immediately upon\r\nthe chalk and is surmounted by beds of calcareous rubble, containing\r\nbones and teeth of Elephants, to the height of one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet, some fishermen had observed a huge bone, that had been laid\r\nbare by an unusually high tide and now projected two or three feet\r\nbeyond the face of the Cliff. Unable to remove it, they broke off the\r\nextremity, a fragment of which was sent to me. Upon repairing to the\r\nspot a few days afterwards, I found that the fishermen had renewed\r\ntheir attack, and demolished a considerable portion of the bone in\r\nineffectual attempts to dislodge it from its bed; and had desisted only\r\nfrom the apprehension of being buried beneath the overhanging cliff,\r\nwhich is composed of loosely aggregated materials. Unfortunately,\r\nthe bone extended directly into the cliff, and it required several\r\nhours of labour, not unattended with danger, before an excavation was\r\nmade sufficiently large to expose the entire specimen. It proved to\r\nbe the anterior nine feet of the left branch of the lower jaw of a\r\nwhale-bone Whale (_Balæna mysticetus_). It was of a light fawn colour\r\nexternally, but the internal coarse osseous structure was delicately\r\nwhite; it was extremely brittle, and, upon attempting to move it,\r\nbroke into a thousand pieces. Time would not permit of the application\r\nof a coating of plaster of Paris, for ere we had completed our task\r\nthe tide was rapidly approaching, or this interesting relic might\r\nhave been extracted entire. This portion of lower jaw, before it was\r\nmutilated by the fishermen, was twelve feet long, and thirty-six inches\r\nin circumference at the largest extremity. It must have belonged to a\r\nWhale from sixty to seventy feet in length.[736]\r\n\r\n[736] The fragments of this jaw that were preserved are now exhibited\r\nin the British Museum, in Room V.\r\n\r\nIn the fluviatile silt of the valley of the Ouse, near Lewes (_Wond._\r\np. 63), the skull of a Porpoise and a portion of the cranium, with the\r\nsocket of the long straight tooth, of a Narwhal (_Monodon monoceros_),\r\nwere found twelve feet beneath the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe bones of an herbivorous Cetacean, the _Manatus_, a genus now\r\npeculiar to the torrid zone, have been found in the eocene strata in\r\nvarious parts of France, associated with those of the Palæotheria and\r\nother extinct mammalia of the Paris basin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ZEUGLODON.]\r\n\r\nZeuglodon cetoides. _Lign. 249._[737]--The remains of a very remarkable\r\nCetacean, of an extinct genus, were first made known by Dr. Harlan,\r\nof Philadelphia, who obtained a considerable portion of the jaws with\r\nteeth, vertebræ, and other bones of an animal of enormous size, from\r\nAlabama and Arkansas, United States. These relics were discovered\r\nin tertiary (_eocene_) limestone, associated with a marine shelly\r\nconglomerate, from a cliff near the bed of the river Owachita. When\r\nfirst observed, the bones extended along the face of the rock, with\r\nintervals between them, to the extent of one hundred feet, and the\r\nanimal to which they belonged must have exceeded seventy feet in\r\nlength. Dr. Harlan ascribed these bones to an unknown reptile, which\r\nhe called Basilosaurus (_king of the lizards_); but a more correct\r\ninvestigation, by Professor Owen, proved their cetacean character,\r\nand the peculiar form of the worn molar teeth suggested the name of\r\n_Zeuglodon_ (_yoke-tooth_).\r\n\r\n[737] Owen, _Geol.

They are devoid of\r\nenamel, but the dentine is coated with cement, and their structure is\r\ndecidedly mammalian; and a microscopical examination, Professor Owen\r\nstates, incontestably proves their cetacean character. The longitudinal\r\ndiameter of the middle tooth is three inches.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ resemble those of the large cetacean known by the name of\r\n_Hyperoodon_; a caudal vertebra is figured _Lign. 249, fig. 3_.

Mam._ p. 444, _et\r\nseq._)--The fossil bones of animals of this order are very numerous in\r\nthe alluvial deposits, in caves, and in pleistocene deposits, in almost\r\nevery part of the world. They are generally associated with the remains\r\nof the next group. The skulls of Oxen, and horns and bones of the Bison\r\nand Auroch, have been found in North Cliff, Yorkshire, at Walton in\r\nEssex, and other parts of England. The fossil oxen appear to have been\r\none-third larger than the recent species; and the horns are relatively\r\nmore massive than in the domestic race; some of the horns measure four\r\nfeet across, at the widest expansion. In the immense accumulations of\r\nlarge mammalia in the tertiary beds of the Sub-Himalayan or Siwalik\r\nrange, numerous remains of oxen occur. The teeth of one species are\r\noften found in the Elephant-bed at Brighton.\r\n\r\nOf the Deer family the relics of several kinds have been discovered in\r\nDrift and Caverns. The cave of Kirkdale alone contained the remains of\r\nthree species.[738] The bones of a species that cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom the common Bed Deer are found in the modern shell-marls of\r\nScotland, associated with the remains of oxen, horse, boar, dog, wolf,\r\nand beaver. The bones and antlers of the Reindeer have been found at\r\nBrentford and other places (_Brit. Foss. Mam._ p. 479; and _Rep. Brit.\r\nAssoc._ 1851. Sect. p. 69). The ossiferous caverns, which contain bones\r\nof Carnivora, also yield those of Deer; as the caves of Kirkdale and\r\nBanwell, &c. in England, and the celebrated caverns of Muggendorf, on\r\nthe Continent. A species of Musk-deer has been found at Epplesheim; and\r\nbones of deer are associated with those of the Dinotherium, in Rhenish\r\nHesse, in late Tertiary deposits. The teeth and a lower jaw, with other\r\nbones, of a species of deer, were obtained from the Brighton Elephant\r\nbed (_Wond._ p. 114).\r\n\r\n[738] The Rev.

(Geol. Journ.\r\nvol. iv. p. 42.) A skeleton that was found, almost entire, in marl\r\nabounding in fresh-water shells, at the depth of twenty feet, is six\r\nfeet high, nine feet long, and nine and a half feet in height, to the\r\ntop of the right horn. Some antlers are so large, that the interspace\r\nfrom one point to the other exceeds twelve feet.[739]\r\n\r\n[739] See _Pict.

The living creature must have resembled an immense Antelope\r\nor Gnu, with a short thick head and an elevated cranium, crested\r\nwith two pairs of horns. A splendid specimen of the skull of the\r\n_Sivatherium_ has been placed in the palæontological collection of the\r\nBritish Museum by Dr. Falconer (_Petrif._ p. 456, _Lign._ 98).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ELEPHANT.

Atlas_, pl. lxxi. lxxiv.) of these\r\ngigantic animals are so abundant, that examples may be found in all the\r\nprovincial, and in most private collections; and the British Museum\r\npossesses an unrivalled series of specimens of both groups of these\r\ncolossal herbivorous mammalia, namely, the Elephants properly so called\r\nand the Mastodons (_Petrif._ pp. 463, 471). It contains an invaluable\r\nseries of specimens from the Siwalik hills, presented by Capt. Cautley\r\nand Dr. Falconer (_Petrif._ p. 469); amongst which are remains in which\r\nthe dental organs present every modification of structure, from that\r\nof the mastoid tubercles of the tooth of the Mastodon, to the vertical\r\nlaminæ of cement, enamel, and dentine of the Elephant. The Museum also\r\npossesses the entire skeleton of the Mastodon (_Petrif._ _Lign._ 107)\r\nformerly exhibited by M. Koch, as well as the fine suite of jaws and\r\nteeth obtained by the same indefatigable collector. This collection\r\ndemonstrates that all the bones and teeth, apparently of several\r\nspecies, and, as some have supposed, of distinct genera, belong but to\r\nthe one grand Mastodon--the _M. giganteus_ of Cuvier; it also clearly\r\nproves that the young mastodon had a pair of tusks placed horizontally\r\nin the lower jaw; and that but one of these tusks became developed in\r\nthe adult, and that only in the male.[741]\r\n\r\n[741] This remarkable circumstance, in the infancy of palæontological\r\nscience, gave rise to a very venial error; it was made to constitute\r\nthe character of a new genus, to which the name _Tetracaulodon_ was\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unnecessary to enlarge upon this subject, for an\r\ninspection of a few specimens will afford the student a clearer insight\r\ninto the structure of the skeletons and teeth of these animals than any\r\ndescription. The form of the teeth, and the disposition of the dental\r\nelements, are illustrated in _Wond._ p. 143, and _Ly._ p. 159.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DINOTHERIUM.]\r\n\r\nDinotherium. _Petrif._ p. 474; _Wond._ p. 173; _Bd._ i. p. 135, pl.\r\nii.--At Epplesheim, forty miles north-east of Darmstadt, in beds of\r\nsand and marl of the median Tertiary formations, the jaws, teeth,\r\nskull, and other remains of the Dinothere, one of the most gigantic of\r\nterrestrial mammalians, have been discovered; they are preserved in the\r\nmuseum at Darmstadt. The length of the largest species is estimated at\r\neighteen feet. The teeth had previously been found in France, Bavaria,\r\nand Austria; and, from their close analogy to those of the Tapir, were\r\ndescribed by Cuvier as belonging to an extinct colossal animal of that\r\ngenus. But subsequent discoveries have shown that the _Dinotherium_ was\r\nprobably a proboscideal animal, and had two large curved tusks directed\r\ndownwards in the anterior extremity of the lower jaw.[742]\r\n\r\n[742] There are some fine specimens, and good models of the Darmstadt\r\nspecimens, in the British Museum (_Petrif._ p. 474).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 255.

The _Palæotheria_ and _Anoplotheria_ must\r\nbe familiar to the intelligent reader, for the restored outlines of\r\nseveral species are appended to almost every work that treats of the\r\nancient inhabitants of our globe. The details of their anatomical\r\ncharacters are given at length in _Oss. Foss._ tom. iii., illustrated\r\nwith numerous plates.\r\n\r\nThe Palæotheria (_Brit. Foss. Mam._ p. 316, _et seq._) resembled the\r\nTapirs in their head and short proboscis, while their molar teeth\r\napproached those of the Rhinoceros, and their feet were divided into\r\nthree toes, instead of four, as in the Tapirs. Upwards of eleven\r\nspecies have been discovered, varying from the size of the Rhinoceros\r\nto that of the Hog. Their remains are extensively diffused in the Upper\r\nEocene strata in various parts of France; and have been found in the\r\nIsle of Wight.\r\n\r\nThe Lophiodon (_crested-tooth_), a genus distinguished from the former\r\nby the characters of the teeth, which more nearly resemble those of\r\nthe Tapirs, comprehends twelve species, all found in the fresh-water\r\nTertiary marls of France. A canine tooth of a species of _Lophiodon_\r\nwas found in the London Clay, in sinking a well on Sydenham Common,\r\nnear the railway.[743]\r\n\r\n[743] See Mr. Douglas Allport’s interesting _History of Camberwell_, p.\r\n17, and Owen’s _Brit.

The skeletons of these remarkable\r\nanimals are imbedded with the remains of carnivora, marsupialia, bats,\r\nbirds, crocodiles, tortoises, and fishes.\r\n\r\nIn England, no remains of the extinct Pachydermata of the Paris\r\nTertiary strata were discovered until a few years since, and they\r\nare still exceedingly rare. There have been found in the fresh-water\r\nlimestone at Binstead, near Ryde, and at Seafield, Isle of Wight, (see\r\n_Geol. I. Wight_, 1854, Prefat.

Thus,\r\nin the Elephant (_Lign. 259, 260_), Horse (_Lign. 263_), &c., the\r\ndentine, cement, and enamel are disposed in vertical plates more\r\nor less inflected, the enamel and cement penetrating the body of\r\nthe tooth, and embracing corresponding processes of dentine; an\r\narrangement by which a grinding surface, composed of three substances\r\nof unequal densities, is produced and maintained in every state of\r\ndetrition (_Owen_). But these teeth do not possess the symmetrical and\r\ncomplicated structure observable in those of many of the reptiles and\r\nfishes we have previously investigated. In the carnivorous mammalia,\r\nthe enamel constitutes an external shell or case, investing the body\r\nof dentine and presenting sharp cusps or trenchant ridges, adapted for\r\nthe laceration of flesh, as in the Tiger, or modified so as to form\r\ninstruments for snapping and crushing bones, as in the teeth of the\r\nHyæna. In the Mastodon, the crown of the tooth, when first emerged\r\nfrom the gum, presents a series of strong conical eminences (_Lign.\r\n254_), that become worn down by use, at first into disks (_Ly._ p.\r\n157), which, by further detrition, coalesce. The tooth of the Elephant\r\n(_Lign._ 259 and 260), on the contrary, consists of vertical plates\r\nof dentine, with an immediate investment of enamel, over which there\r\nis an external layer of cement that binds together the entire series\r\nof plates, often amounting to twenty or more; the horizontal surface\r\nproduced by the detrition of such a structure, gives rise to the\r\nwell-known grinding surface of the molars of the elephant (_Lign.\r\n259, 260_; _Wond._ pp. 143 and 160; _Ly._ p. 159; Owens _Brit.

Detached plates of the teeth of Elephants,\r\nparticularly of those which belong to the back part of the posterior\r\ngrinder, and have not come into use, are puzzling to the inexperienced\r\ncollector of fossil remains; and the first indication I obtained of\r\nthe existence of the remains of fossil Elephants in Brighton Cliffs\r\n(_Wond._ p. 150), was from a mass of this kind, dug up in sinking a\r\nwell in Dorset Gardens, and sent to me as a \"petrified cauliflower.\"\r\n\r\n[745] For the minute structure of the dental organs, the modes of\r\ndentition prevalent in the mammalia, and the homologies of the teeth,\r\nwe must refer to Prof. Owen’s often-quoted works, the matchless\r\n_Odontography_, and the lucid and compendious Article on Teeth, in the\r\n_Cyclopædia of Anatomy and Physiology_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 258.\r\n\r\nTooth of Mastodon elephantoides: 1/6 _nat. size_.\r\n\r\n_Upper Tertiary._ _Ava, Burmah._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 259.\r\n\r\nTooth of Elephas primigenius: 1/6 _nat. size_.\r\n\r\n_Upper Tertiary._ _Big-bone-lick.

Beds of clay, sand,\r\nand limestone, containing marine shells and teeth of sharks; these\r\nare the lowermost strata. 2. Indurated marl. 3. Red clayey earth with\r\ncalcareous concretions, in which the bones of colossal terrestrial\r\nmammalia are abundant. This vertical section demonstrates, that an\r\nextensive bay of salt-water was gradually encroached upon, and at\r\nlength converted into a muddy estuary, by detritus brought down from\r\nthe interior of the country, and in which carcases of land-animals\r\nfloated and ultimately became engulphed in the silt. It is in these\r\nlast deposits, which now form the immediate subsoil of the Pampas, that\r\nthe teeth of the _Megatherium_, _Mylodon_, _Glyptodon_, _Mastodon_,\r\n_Horse_, &c. have been found.[748]\r\n\r\n[747] See \"Buenos Ayres,\" &c., by Sir Woodbine Parish, 1852, pp.\r\n209-223.\r\n\r\n[748] See the charming volume entitled, \"Journal of the Voyage of\r\nH.

Parish, Mr.\r\nDarwin, and Mr. Pentland, and of Dr. Lund and other foreign savants,\r\nhave brought to light. I can only advert to two other genera, namely,\r\nthe _Glyptodon_ and _Mylodon_.[749]\r\n\r\n[749] An able memoir in the Penny Cyclopædia, Art. Megatheridæ, and\r\nanother under the title \"Unau,\" will present the student with an\r\nepitome of all that is at present known of these extinct beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLYPTODON.]\r\n\r\nGlyptodon (_sculptured-tooth_) clavipes. _Lign. 264._--The bony\r\ntesselated carapace, or shield, which was formerly assigned to the\r\nMegatherium (_Bd._ i. p. 159) has been proved,[750] by the discovery\r\nof other specimens, to belong to a gigantic animal, whose bones are\r\noccasionally found associated with those of the Megatherium, and\r\nwhich is closely allied to the Armadillo. This discovery was made by\r\nmy friend, Sir Woodbine Parish, to whose indefatigable exertions the\r\nHunterian Museum is indebted for its most splendid relics of fossil\r\nEdentata.[751] The bony dermal coat of the Glyptodon (a fine specimen\r\nof which is in the Hunterian Museum) was not disposed in rings as\r\nin the Armadillo, but is made up of polygonal pieces, accurately\r\narticulating with each other, and continuous over the whole of the\r\nupper part of the body and part of the tail; the tail also is enclosed\r\nin a case of this kind, like a sword in its scabbard (_Petrif._ p. 359,\r\n_Lign._ 75).\r\n\r\n[750] See _Geol.

The hind foot is\r\nvery peculiar (see _Lign. 264, fig. 3_), presenting an extreme\r\nmodification of the same general plan of structure as that of the\r\nArmadillo. The skeleton of this animal constitutes the type of a\r\ndistinct genus (_Glyptodon_), related to the Armadillo (_Dasypus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 264.

The skeleton measures eleven\r\nfeet from the fore part of the skull to the extremity of the tail,\r\nthe latter being three feet in length; the circumference of the trunk\r\naround the tenth pair of ribs is nine feet nine inches; the Megatherium\r\nis eighteen feet in length, and its girth fourteen and a half feet.\r\nThese particulars will serve to convey an idea of the relative size of\r\nthese gigantic animals. From certain peculiarities in the construction\r\nof the skeleton of the Mylodon, Prof. Owen, perceiving from the teeth\r\nthat it was a vegetable feeder, and probably lived on leaves and the\r\ntender buds of trees, and its enormous bulk and weight forbidding\r\nthe assumption that it climbed up trees and suspended itself by the\r\nbranches, like the diminutive existing Sloths,--assigns to this\r\ncreature the task of uprooting and felling trees, and feeding upon the\r\nfoliage of the forests it laid prostrate. A remarkable development\r\nof the substance of the bones of the skull is presumed to hare been\r\na provision against the fatal effects of a fracture of the cranium,\r\nto which the Mylodon, from its supposed uprooting propensities, is\r\nconjectured to have been peculiarly exposed; and the skull of the\r\nspecimen in the College bears proofs of having had two fractures, from\r\nboth of which the animal recovered. But whoever looks at the skeleton\r\nwill perceive that the fore-feet are admirably adapted for seizing\r\nand wrenching oft the branches, and the hinder feet for clasping the\r\ntrunk of a large tree; and there is nothing to forbid the supposition,\r\nthat the animal could obtain a constant and ready supply of food, by\r\nclimbing up the stem to a sufficient height, and wrenching off the\r\nbranches. Prof. Owen states, that the Mylodon unites the two great\r\ngroups of the _Unguiculata_ (animals with nails and claws), and the\r\n_Ungulata_ (hoofed animals), for it has both hoofs and claws on the\r\nsame feet.\r\n\r\n[752] Signifying _molar-tooth_,--a name intended to express that the\r\nanimal has only teeth adapted for grinding; but this term is equally\r\napplicable to all the other megatheroid animals.\r\n\r\n[753] See \"Description of the Skeleton of an extinct gigantic Sloth\r\n(_Mylodon robustus_),\" &c., by Richard Owen, F.R.S. Hunterian Professor\r\nof the Royal College of Surgeons, 1 vol. 4to. with twenty-four plates,\r\n1842. The lithographs in this work, by Mr. Scharf, are of the highest\r\nexcellence: the figure of the entire skeleton of the animal, on a scale\r\nof two inches to a foot, is admirable.\r\n\r\nThe dental organs consist of four molars on each side the lower, and\r\nfive on each side the upper jaw. The teeth are implanted in very deep\r\nsockets, and are of the same size and form throughout, with a conical\r\npulp-cavity at the base, indicating that their growth continued\r\nduring the life of the animal. In structure they resemble those of\r\nthe Megatherium and Sloth (_Bradypus_); being composed of a pillar of\r\ncoarse dentine, traversed by numerous vascular or medullary canals,\r\nwhich is invested with a layer of very fine, dense dentine, with minute\r\ncalcigerous tubes, and the whole surrounded by a thick coating of\r\ncementum: no enamel enters into their composition. (_Owen._)\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Fossil Rodents.--Of the mammalia termed _Rodentia_ or Gnawers (see\r\n_Wond._ p. 143), of which the Mouse, Rabbit, and Beaver are examples,\r\nthe remains of several genera are found in a fossil state; particularly\r\nin the caverns containing the bones of Carnivora. Dr. Buckland\r\ncollected from Kirkdale Cave-bones of a species of Hare or Rabbit,\r\nMouse and Water-Rat (_Reliq. Diluv._ pl. xi.).\r\n\r\nIn the eocene gypseous strata of France, two species of Dormouse and\r\ntwo of Squirrel have been found. From the tertiary sand at Epplesheim,\r\nwith the bones of the Dinotherium, those of a species of Hamster or\r\nGerman Dormouse (_Cricetus_) were obtained.\r\n\r\nFossil teeth of a species of Porcupine (_Hystrix_) occur in the\r\npliocene deposits of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nOf the Beaver (_Castor_), some undoubted remains have been collected in\r\nthis country. Those of a species apparently identical with the recent\r\nBeaver of the Danube, have been discovered in the fresh-water deposits\r\nof Essex,[754] Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, and Berks, and in Scotland; and\r\nthe remains of the very large extinct species first observed in Russia\r\n(and named, by M. Fischer, _Trogontherium_,) have been found in the\r\nsubterranean forest at Bacton, in Suffolk.[755]\r\n\r\n[754] See Mr. Brown’s Paper on Copford, _Quart. Geol.

Fossil Marsupialia.[756]--That the remains of an extinct species\r\nof gigantic _Kangaroo_ should be found in the fissures of the rocks\r\nand in the caverns of Australia, a country in which marsupial animals\r\nare the principal existing mammalia, is a fact that will not excite\r\nmuch surprise; but that beings of this remarkable type of organization\r\nshould ever have inhabited the countries situated in the latitude of\r\nthe European continent and of Great Britain, would never have been\r\nsuspected, but for the researches of the geologist. The fossil remains\r\nof this class discovered in Australia[757] occur in the pleistocene\r\ndeposits of Darling Downs, Melbourne, &c. and in fissures and caves\r\nin the limestone of Wellington Valley, imbedded in red ochreous loam,\r\nand are often incrusted by stalactitic concretions. One of the species\r\nexceeds the largest existing Kangaroo, and its bones are associated\r\nwith those of the Wombat, and other marsupial animals (_Ly._ p. 155).\r\n\r\n[756] Marsupialia; animals that carry their young in a pouch\r\n(_marsupium_), as the Kangaroo.\r\n\r\n[757] Rep. Brit. Assoc. 1844, p. 223.\r\n\r\nA species of Didelphys (_Opossum_) has been discovered in the gypseous\r\nlimestone of Montmartre, and is figured and described by Cuvier (_Oss.\r\nFoss._ vol. iii. pl. lxxi.; see also _Brit. Foss. Mam._ p. 76). It\r\nconsists of a considerable part of the skeleton of a small animal,\r\nimbedded in gypsum; the block containing the specimen has been split\r\nasunder, and some of the bones are attached to the surface of one\r\nmoiety, and the remainder to the other. From the character of the\r\njaws and teeth, Cuvier pronounced that the animal was related to the\r\nOpossum, and confidently predicted that the two peculiar bones which\r\nsupport the pouch in these animals would be found attached to the\r\nfore-part of the pelvis; accordingly he chiselled away the stone, and\r\ndisclosed these _marsupial_ bones; thus proving the truth of those\r\nlaws of correlation of structure, which he was the first to enunciate\r\nand establish. But as there are true marsupials in which the _ossa\r\nmarsupialia_ are merely rudimentary, for example, in the Dog-headed\r\nOpossum, or \"Hyæna\" of the Tasmanian colonists (_Thylacinus Harrisii_),\r\nin which they are merely two small, oblong, flattened fibro-cartilages,\r\nimbedded in the internal pillars of the abdominal rings, and are only\r\nsix lines long and three or four lines broad,--it follows that in a\r\nfossil state the pelvis of a true marsupial animal may be destitute\r\nof those appendages which are commonly supposed to be an essential\r\ncharacter of the marsupial skeleton. Thus the fossil pelvis of the\r\nThylacinus, had that species been long ago, as it is soon likely to be,\r\nextinct, would not have afforded the certain evidence of its marsupial\r\ncharacter to which Cuvier triumphantly appealed in demonstration of\r\nthe Didelphys of the gypsum quarries of Montmartre; yet the Thylacinus\r\nwould not therefore have been less essentially a marsupial animal.[758]\r\n\r\n[758] See Prof. Owen, _Zoological Society’s Proceedings_, Dec. 1844.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL MAMMALIA.]\r\n\r\nIn the Eocene sand at Kyson, near Woodbridge, in Suffolk, among\r\nother mammalian remains (_Ly._ p. 203), Mr. Colchester, of Ipswich,\r\nwhose researches have been rewarded by many interesting fossils,\r\nfound a fragment of the jaw, with one premolar tooth having two\r\nfangs, of a small animal (_Didelphys Colchesteri_, Owen); and which\r\nMr. Charlesworth (Curator of the Philosophical Institution of York)\r\nascertained to belong to a marsupial animal allied to the Opossum.[759]\r\n\r\n[759] See _Mag.

(_Wond._\r\np. 529), a few minute _mammalian_ teeth have been discovered by M.\r\nPlieninger at Diegerloch, near Stuttgart, Würtemberg. They appear to\r\nhave belonged to one or more small Insectivorous quadrupeds, and have\r\nbeen described by Plieninger and Jäger. Sir C. Lyell, in the Prefatory\r\nNote to his Manual, 1852, fully treats of these interesting and most\r\nancient mammalian remains, and gives several exact figures of the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STONESFIELD MAMMALIA.]\r\n\r\nFossil Mammalia of Stonesfield.[760] _Lign. 265._ (_Bd._ pl. ii. _Ly._\r\np. 268. _Wond._ p. 510.)--The best known examples of the fossil remains\r\nof mammalia in the Secondary formations, and, excepting the teeth just\r\nmentioned, of the highest antiquity, according to our present knowledge\r\nof the earth’s physical history, are several mutilated lower jaws with\r\nteeth, of some very small animals, which are supposed to belong to\r\ninsectivorous marsupial quadrupeds.[761]\r\n\r\n[760] See Owen’s _Brit.

Two specimens of the natural size are represented _Lign.\r\n265_, and will serve for reference to the collector who may visit that\r\ninteresting locality.\r\n\r\nThe existence of undoubted mammalia in the secondary formations was\r\nfirst made known by Dr. Buckland (in 1823), who, upon the authority of\r\nCuvier, stated that the two specimens then discovered at Stonesfield\r\nbelonged to marsupials allied to the Opossum (_Didelphys_). These\r\nfossils were the left branches of two lower jaws; both were imbedded in\r\nthe stone by the external surface, the inner side only being exposed.\r\nOne of the specimens has ten molar teeth in a row; the other (the\r\nbeautiful fossil, _fig. 1, Lign. 265_, now in the British Museum,)\r\nhas seven molars, one canine tooth, and three incisors. Five other\r\nspecimens have since been found.[762]\r\n\r\n[762] See _Brit. Foss. Mam._ pp. 15-70, for ample details of their\r\nanatomical characters, and physiological relations.\r\n\r\nThe _Amphitherium_ had thirty-two teeth in the lower jaw, that is,\r\nsixteen on each side; it is presumed to have been insectivorous, and\r\nto have belonged to the _placental_ mammalia. The _Phascolotherium_\r\nhad four true molar teeth, and three or four false molars, one canine,\r\nand three incisors in each branch of the lower jaw; and closely\r\napproximates to _marsupial_ genera now restricted to New South Wales\r\nand Van Diemen’s Land. It is, indeed, as Professor Phillips first\r\nremarked, an interesting fact, that the other organic remains of the\r\nBritish Oolite correspond with the existing forms now confined to\r\nthe Australian continent and neighbouring seas; for in those distant\r\nlatitudes, the _Cestracionts_, _Trigoniæ_, and _Terebratulæ_ inhabit\r\nthe ocean, and the _Cycadeæ_ and _Araucariæ_ flourish on the dry land\r\n(_Wond._ p. 894).\r\n\r\nThus we have evidence of the existence of the Marsupial order during\r\nthe Secondary and Tertiary formations, a proof, as Dr. Buckland\r\nobserves (_Bd._ p. 73), that this order, instead of being, as was once\r\nsupposed, of more recent introduction than other orders of mammalia,\r\nwas, in reality, the most ancient condition under which animals of\r\nthis class first existed in the earlier geological epochs, and was\r\ncoexistent with many other orders throughout Europe in the Eocene\r\nperiod; while its geographical distribution in the existing fauna is\r\nrestricted to North and South America, and to New Holland, and the\r\nadjacent islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Fossil Carnivora.--The fossil bones and teeth of numerous species\r\nof _Carnivora_, the order comprising the mammalia which prey on other\r\nanimals, of which the Weasel, Bear, Cat, Dog, &c. are examples, abound\r\nin fissures and caverns, in conglomerated rocks, and in drifted sand\r\nand gravel. The remains of the colossal Pachyderms, the Mastodons and\r\nElephants, lie buried, for the most part, as we have previously shown,\r\nin the superficial alluvial deposits; but the Carnivora, although\r\noccasionally entombed with the Herbivora in superficial gravels and\r\nloams, are principally found imbedded in the floors of extensive\r\ncaverns.[763] In many instances, such immense quantities of bones and\r\nteeth of individuals of all ages, and belonging to but one or two\r\nspecies, occur in certain caves, as to render it probable that these\r\nwere for a long period the dens of the extinct species of Bears,\r\nHyænas, &c. whose bones they enclose.\r\n\r\n[763] _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1842, sect. p. 62. For an account of the\r\nossiferous caves of the Brazils, see _Petrif._ p. 483.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable geological condition in which fossil bones\r\nof Carnivora occur, is that of an ossiferous conglomerate, or\r\n_bone-breccia_; that is, a conglomerate formed of fragments of\r\nlimestone and bones, cemented together into a hard rock by a reddish\r\ncalcareous concretion. This breccia is found in almost all the islands\r\non the shores of the basin of the Mediterranean Sea; as for example,\r\nat Gibraltar, Cette, Nice, Cerigo, Corsica, Palermo, &c. The most\r\ncelebrated of the bone-caves are situated in Franconia, and in many\r\nparts of the Hartz. That of Gailenreuth has long been known for its\r\nfossil treasures, which principally consist of the bones and teeth\r\nof two extinct species of Bears. One of these is equal in size to a\r\nlarge horse, and is termed _Ursus spelæus_ (Bear of the Caverns); and\r\nskeletons have been found of all ages, from the adult to the cub but\r\na few days old (see _Wond._ pp. 176, 177). There are numerous caverns\r\nin the neighbouring district, some of which are equally rich in the\r\nremains of Carnivora.[764] Similar fossils are also found in the\r\nconsolidated gravel and drift in various parts of Germany, and in the\r\nfissures of rocks containing iron-ore, at Kropp, in Carniola.\r\n\r\n[764] A highly interesting account of the Ossiferous Caves of the Hartz\r\nand Franconia, by Sir Philip Grey Egerton, Bart, was published in 1834,\r\n_Geol. Proc._ vol. ii. p. 94. See also Captain Montagu’s notice of the\r\nSophienhöhle further on, at p. 820.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BONE-CAVERNS.]\r\n\r\nEven in Australia, caves with ossiferous breccia are numerous; but the\r\nbones belong to extinct marsupial animals of genera still existing\r\nin the country (see _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1844; _Petrif._ p. 133; and\r\n_Wond._ p. 188). In England, several caverns presenting similar\r\nphenomena have been discovered. That of Kirkdale, near Kirby Moorside,\r\nYorkshire, is well known from the celebrity it acquired by the graphic\r\nillustration of its contents by Dr. Buckland.[765] This cave, or\r\nrather fissure, for its dimensions were too limited to merit the name\r\nof cavern, was situated in oolitic limestone; it was two hundred and\r\nfifty feet long, from two to fourteen high, and six or seven wide. The\r\nfloor was occupied by a bed of indurated mud, covered over with a thick\r\ncrust of stalagmite; the roof and sides being invested with a similar\r\ncalcareous sparry coating, as is commonly the case in all fissures in\r\nlimestone rocks.[766] From this cave were obtained numerous bones of\r\nHyænas, associated with bones, more or less fractured, of Tiger, Bear,\r\nWolf, Fox, Weasel, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Horse, Deer,\r\nOx, Hare or Rabbit, Mouse, Water-rat, and fragments of skeletons of\r\nRavens, Pigeons, Larks, and Ducks. Many of the bones exhibited marks\r\nof having been gnawed, and crushed by the teeth of some animals. From\r\nall the facts observed, and which are detailed by Dr. Buckland with\r\nhis wonted graphic power, it is inferred that the cave was inhabited\r\nfor a considerable period by Hyænas; that many of the remains found\r\nthere were of individuals carried in and devoured by those animals, and\r\nthat in some instances the hyænas preyed upon each other. The portions\r\nof bone referable to the elephant seem to prove that occasionally the\r\nlarge mammalia were also obtained for food; but it is probable that\r\nthe smaller animals were either drifted in by currents of water, or\r\nfell into the chasm through fissures now closed up by stalactitical\r\nincrustations.\r\n\r\n[765] Dr. Buckland’s celebrated work, \"Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,\" contains\r\nan admirable description of these caverns and their contents, with\r\nnumerous plates. The student, in consulting this volume, must separate\r\nthe _facts_ from the diluvial theory, which, at the period of its\r\npublication (1823), they were supposed by Dr. Buckland and other\r\neminent geologists to confirm.\r\n\r\n[766] For a general description of the cave at Kirkdale, see _Wond._ p.\r\n179; and for details, _Reliq. Diluv._ pp. 1-19. The ossiferous caves at\r\nKirkdale, Torquay, and Banwell are noticed, _Petrif._ p. 482.\r\n\r\nKent’s Cave, near Torquay, Oreston Cave, near Plymouth, and several\r\nother caves in Devonshire, have yielded great numbers of bones and\r\nteeth of Carnivora and Pachydermata (see _Reliq. Diluv._ p. 67).\r\n\r\nKent’s Hole is the most productive ossiferous cavern in England,\r\nand its vicinity to Torquay renders it of easy access. An extensive\r\ncollection of teeth and bones was obtained from this cave by the\r\nlate Rev. J. MacEnery, comprising, in addition to the usual extinct\r\nCarnivora, skulls and teeth of Badger (_Meles taxus_), Otter (_Lutra\r\nvulgaris_), Pole-cat (_Putorius vulgaris_), Stoat or Ermine (_P.\r\nerminius_), &c. A selection of the choicest specimens in this\r\ncollection is deposited in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nIn Glamorganshire, two large caverns, called Goat’s Hole, and Paviland\r\nCave, containing numerous bones of Bear, Hyæna, Wolf, Fox, Rhinoceros,\r\nElephant, &c., are situated in a lofty cliff of limestone, between\r\nOxwich Bay and the Worm’s Head, on the property of Earl Talbot, fifteen\r\nmiles west of Swansea (_Reliq. Diluv._ p. 82).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CARNIVORA.]\r\n\r\nIn the western district of the Mendip Hills, in Somersetshire, there\r\nare several ossiferous fissures and caves. The most interesting are\r\nthose of Hutton, on the northern escarpment of Bleadon Hill; and of\r\nBanwell, lying about a mile to the east of Hutton. They contain remains\r\nof two species of bear, one (_Ursus spelæus_) of immense size and\r\nstrength; and of Tiger, Hyæna, Wolf, Fox, Deer, Ox, and Elephant.[767]\r\n\r\n[767] See a Memoir \"On the Caverns and Fissures in the Western District\r\nof the Mendip Hills,\" by the late Rev. D. Williams. Proc. Royal\r\nSociety, June 2, 1831, p. 55.\r\n\r\nFrom the caves at Hutton, the Rev. D. Williams obtained the milk-teeth\r\nand other remains of a calf-elephant, about two years old, and those\r\nof a young tiger, just shedding its milk-teeth; also the grinders of a\r\nyoung horse, that were casting their coronary surfaces; and remains of\r\ntwo species of hyæna.\r\n\r\nBut one instance of the fossil bones of Carnivora has been observed\r\nin the south-east of England. It occurred in a fissure in a quarry of\r\nsandstone at Boughton, near Maidstone; among other bones, the lower\r\njaw of a Hyæna (see Frontispiece of Vol. I.), with the teeth, was\r\nobtained.[768]\r\n\r\n[768] See _Mag. Nat. Hist._ 1836, vol. ix. p. 593; and _Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc._ vol. vii. p. 383.\r\n\r\nIn the modern silt of our alluvial districts, the remains of\r\ncarnivorous animals, formerly indigenous to this island, are\r\noccasionally met with; and the skeleton of the Brown Bear (a species\r\nwhich inhabited Scotland eight centuries ago), and of the Wolf,\r\nwhose extinction is of a yet later date, have been discovered. The\r\nWoodwardian Museum at Cambridge contains an entire skull of the Brown\r\nBear (_Ursus arctos_), found in the Manea Fen of Cambridgeshire;[769]\r\nin an ancient fresh-water deposit, near Bacton, in Norfolk, the right\r\nlower jaw of the Bear of the Caverns (_Ursus spelæus_), has been\r\ndiscovered;[770] and the phalangeal bone of a large Bear has been found\r\nby Mr. J. Brown in the pleistocene deposits at Copford, Essex, with\r\nthe remains of Beaver, Elephant, Stag, &c. (_Geol. Journ._ vol. viii.\r\np. 187.)\r\n\r\n[769] A beautiful lignograph of this specimen is given in _Hist. Brit.\r\nFoss. Mam._ p. 77, _fig._ 24.\r\n\r\n[770] Hist. Brit. Foss. Mam. p. 89.\r\n\r\nThus the remains of fossil Carnivora discovered in England comprise\r\nseveral kinds of Bear[771] (including the two species of the caverns\r\nof Germany, _U. priscus_ and _U. spelæus_), and of Tiger, Hyæna, Wolf,\r\nFox, &c.\r\n\r\n[771] _Petrif._ p. 398. In the _Pict. Atlas_, pl. lxxiii., is a good\r\nfigure of a large Bear’s tooth. Teeth of Bear, Tiger, Hyæna, and\r\nArvicola, are figured in _Ly._ p. 161.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot dwell on foreign localities of Carnivora, I may\r\nmention that the lacustrine pliocene formation of Œningen occasionally\r\nyields fine remains. A splendid specimen, obtained from that locality\r\nby Sir R. I. Murchison, displays almost the entire skeleton of a\r\nFox-like animal, the _Galecynus Œningensis_ of Prof. Owen.[772]\r\n\r\n[772] See _Geol. Trans._ 2d ser. vol. iii. pl. xxxiii.; and _Quart.\r\nGeol. Journ._ vol. iii. p. 55.\r\n\r\nThe Seal, which is one of the marine carnivorous mammalia, also occurs\r\nin a fossil state in England. A femur of a species of _Phoca_ has been\r\nfound, with the remains of a Monkey and Bat, in a tertiary deposit in\r\nSuffolk. In the tertiary strata of Malta an extinct species of Seal has\r\nalso been discovered. In the bone-beds of New Zealand my son frequently\r\nfound bones and teeth of Seals, probably of the species now inhabiting\r\nthe South Pacific. (_Petrif._ p. 130.)\r\n\r\nOf the Insectivora, the fossil remains of several genera occur.\r\nIn England, the jaw with teeth of a large species of Mole (named\r\nPalæospalax,[773] _ancient mole_), has been discovered in a lacustrine\r\ndeposit at Ostend, near Bacton, on the coast of Norfolk, associated\r\nwith bones of Elephant, Deer, Roebuck, and Beaver. This animal must\r\nhave been as large as a hedgehog. The only part of the skeleton\r\nhitherto obtained is a portion of the left side of the lower jaw,\r\ncontaining six molars; its natural affinities have therefore been\r\ninferred from the characters of the crowns of the teeth.\r\n\r\n[773] _Hist. Brit. Foss. Mam._ p. 25.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FOSSIL CHEIROPTERA AND QUADRUMANA.]\r\n\r\nThe Cheiroptera (_hand-wings_) or Bats, are mammalia which have the\r\npower of flight, from the bones of the phalanges or fingers being\r\nenormously elongated and giving support to a fine membranous expansion;\r\nthey are rarely found fossil, although, from their habits of haunting\r\nand hybernating in fissures and caves, their skeletons often occur\r\nmingled in the earth of the floor of caverns, and imbedded in crannies\r\nof rocks, with bones of extinct animals.\r\n\r\nThe remains of a considerable portion of the skeleton of one species\r\nof Bat was discovered by Cuvier in the gypsum of Montmartre,[774] and\r\nanother example in a gypseous deposit, at Köstritz, in Germany, with\r\nremains of extinct species of other mammalia. Two instances of British\r\nfossil Bats are recorded;[775] the one from Kent’s Cavern, collocated\r\nwith the extinct Carnivora, and referred to the Horse-shoe Bat\r\n(_Rhinolophus_); the other from Kyson, in Suffolk, found in the same\r\ndeposit with the remains of the Monkey, presently to be noticed.\r\n\r\n[774] Discours sur les Révolutions de la Surface du Globe, par Baron\r\nG. Cuvier, 4to. 1826, pl. ii. _fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n[775] _Rep. Brit. Assoc._ 1842, and _Brit. Foss. Mam._ pp. 11-18.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Fossil Quadrumana, or Monkeys.--The illustrious Cuvier, when\r\ncommenting on the extraordinary fact, that among the innumerable\r\nfossil relics of the mammalia which peopled the continents and islands\r\nof our planet, through the vast periods comprehended in the tertiary\r\nformations, no traces of Man or of his works occur, emphatically\r\nremarked, that it was a phenomenon not less surprising, that no\r\nremains of the quadrumanous races, which rank next to Man in physical\r\nconformation, should have been found in a fossil state; and that the\r\ncircumstance was the more remarkable, because the majority of the\r\nmammalia found in the younger and older tertiary strata have their\r\ncongeners at the present time in the warmest regions of the globe; in\r\nthose intertropical climates where the existing quadrumana are almost\r\nexclusively located.[776]\r\n\r\n[776] Discours sur les Révolutions de la Surface du Globe, p. 171.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Ape of France.--But the remains of this order have at length\r\nbeen discovered in the most ancient of the tertiary deposits, and\r\nunder circumstances which admit of no doubt as to the antiquity of the\r\nfossils or the strata in which they were imbedded; and almost at the\r\nsame time in France and in the Sub-Himalayas; and very recently in the\r\nBrazils and in England. The first European specimen was discovered at\r\nSansan, near Auch, about forty miles west of Toulouse, by M. Lartet,\r\nwith remains of the Rhinoceros, Deer, Antelope, Palæotherium, &c. It\r\nconsists of the lower jaw, almost complete, with all the teeth, of an\r\nadult animal, of an extinct species, related to the long-limbed and\r\ntailed monkey, called _Semnopithecus_, of which the Negro Monkey is an\r\nexample. A fragment of another jaw has been found in the same locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Monkey of the Sub-Himalayas.--In the inexhaustible mine of\r\nfossil bones, discovered by British Officers in India, the upper jaw of\r\nan Ape was found by Messrs. Baker and Durand, and fragments of other\r\njaws and some bones were subsequently collected by Dr. Falconer and\r\nCaptain Cautley. These relics conjointly established the existence of\r\na gigantic quadrumanous animal in the groves of India at the Eocene\r\nepoch, when the gigantic Tortoise, the lofty Sivatherium, and the\r\ncolossal Mastodon tenanted the plains, and Hippopotami frequented\r\nthe marshes and rivers. This fossil Ape also is related to the\r\n_Semnopithecus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Monkey of South America.--Dr. Lund, the eminent Danish\r\nnaturalist, to whose indefatigable researches, and successful\r\ndetermination of the colossal Edentata, we have previously alluded, has\r\ndiscovered the bones of a gigantic Ape, four feet in height, related\r\nto the Capuchin Monkey, in the ossiferous breccia of the caves of\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nBritish Fossil Monkeys, _Ly._ p. 202.--The first fossil relic of a\r\nquadrumanous animal from the British strata was obtained in 1839, from\r\na bed of Eocene sand, at Kyson, a few miles east of Woodbridge, in\r\nSuffolk, by W. Colchester, Esq. The first specimen found consisted of a\r\nsmall fragment of the right side of the lower jaw, with the last molar\r\ntooth entire in its socket; another relic is the crown of one fang of\r\nthe first molar tooth, of the same species. These relics have been\r\nreferred to an extinct species of Monkey, related to the _Macacus_,\r\nwhich has been named _Macacus eocænus_, in allusion to the geological\r\nage of the stratum in which the remains were discovered.[777] In this\r\nEocene sand have also been discovered the remains of a Bat (p. 813),\r\nand of a Marsupial (_Didelphys_, p. 805), and numerous fish-teeth\r\n(_Lamna_, p. 594); whilst in the clay overlying this sand were found\r\nthe vertebra of a Serpent (_Palæophis_, p. 738) and several teeth of\r\na Pachyderm (_Hyracotherium_, p. 791). Prof. Owen in the _Hist. Brit.\r\nFoss. Mam._ p. xlvi. figures and briefly notices the relics of another\r\nspecies of _Macacus_, from the newer pliocene, or pleistocene, brick\r\nearth at Grays, Essex.\r\n\r\n[777] Owen, British Fossil Mammalia, p. 1, figs. 1, 3.\r\n\r\nFossil Human Bones.--In the Swabian Alps, human teeth and several\r\nperfect human skulls are said to have been found in deposits in which\r\nelephantine remains also occur. This subject was brought before the\r\nmeeting of the German Association for the Advancement of Science at\r\nTubingen, by Fraas and Jäger, and, if correctly reported, naturally\r\nleads to the conclusion that human beings were contemporaneous with\r\nthe extinct elephants and some of the other large pachydermata in the\r\nregions referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ON COLLECTING FOSSIL MAMMALIA.]\r\n\r\nOn Collecting and Developing the Fossil Remains of Mammalia.--But few\r\ndirections for the developing and repairing of the fossil remains\r\nof mammalia will be required in this place, the suggestions already\r\noffered, and particularly those in vol. i. pp. 45-49, embracing full\r\ninstructions on this head.[778] On the method recommended in p. 46, for\r\nstrengthening the friable bones of the large mammalia, I may observe,\r\nthat the _drying-oil_ is prepared by boiling _litharge_ in oil, in the\r\nproportion of one ounce of the litharge to a pint of oil.\r\n\r\n[778] Cement.--The following formula was given me by an eminent\r\ncollector and developer of fossils:--\r\n\r\nGum mastic, one ounce;\r\n\r\nRectified spirit of wine, sufficient to dissolve it.\r\n\r\nIsinglass, one ounce, soaked in water until soft; then dissolve it in\r\npure rum or brandy until it is in the state of stiff glue: add to this\r\na quarter of an ounce of gum ammoniacum, well rubbed and mixed.\r\n\r\nPut the two solutions together in an earthen vessel, over a gentle\r\nheat; when thoroughly melted and united, put the mixture into smooth,\r\nwell-corked bottles.\r\n\r\n_Use._--Immerse the bottle in hot water until the cement is\r\nsufficiently liquid for use.\r\n\r\nThe search for fossils of this class is attended with much less\r\ncertainty of success than for other animal remains. In the following\r\nlist, page 818, the localities most likely to be productive are\r\nenumerated; but we have no caverns, as in Germany, so rich in remains\r\nof this kind as to ensure the discovery of specimens by the casual\r\nvisitor; for the treasures of the most productive cave, that of\r\nBanwell, are prohibited; the proprietor carefully preserving every\r\nfragment. A short residence near some of the best localities and daily\r\nresearch are required for obtaining interesting specimens. For example,\r\na residence at Ryde, for a search in the fresh-water tertiary limestone\r\nat Binstead; at Torquay, for Kent’s cavern; or some other town or\r\nvillage near the other caves in Devonshire; Herne Bay, for the London\r\nClay at Studd’s Hill, that produced the Hyracotherium; Woodbridge or\r\nKyson, for the Suffolk mammalia; Walton and Clacton, in Essex, for\r\nremains of Elephants in the pleistocene deposits of that coast.\r\n\r\nIn searching for bones and teeth in an unexplored cave, the following\r\nsuggestions by Dr. Buckland will be found of great value. Select the\r\nlowest parts in the cavern or fissure into which any mud or clay\r\ncan have been drifted or accumulated; and then break through the\r\nstalagmitic crust of the floor, and dig down into the silt and pebbles,\r\n&c. below, in which bones and teeth will be found, if the spot contains\r\nany relics of this kind. As a test for distinguishing the ancient\r\nbones found in these caves from those which may have been recently\r\nintroduced, the tongue should be applied to them when dry, and they\r\nwill adhere in consequence of the loss of their animal gluten, without\r\nthe substitution of any mineral substance, such as we commonly find\r\nin the fossil bones of the regular strata. Human bones found in caves\r\nalways possess too much animal gluten to adhere to the tongue when\r\ndry.[779]\r\n\r\n[779] Dr. Buckland on Fossil Bones of Bears in the Grotto of Osselles,\r\nnear Besançon, in France. _Geol. Proc._ vol. i. p. 22.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern coast of England, and often off the mouth of the\r\nThames, the fishermen dredge up teeth, tusks, and bones of Elephants;\r\nand good specimens may sometimes be thus procured. The Ramsgate\r\nfishermen employed in trawling in the North Sea and English channel,\r\nfrequently bring up in their gear fragments of fossil bones of\r\nMammoths, and other mammalia. From the bank of the Goodwin-sands,\r\nlarge tusks have been procured. On the shore near Herne Bay, very\r\nfine mammalian remains are occasionally obtained. In the Museum at\r\nCanterbury, there was (and I believe is) a good collection of fossil\r\nbones of large Pachydermata procured from the neighbouring coast. It is\r\na remarkable fact, that immense quantities of the bones of Mammoths,\r\nor fossil Elephants, are strewn over the bed of the German Ocean and\r\nEnglish Channel.[780] The late Mr. Woodward informed me, that the\r\nteeth and tusks of Elephants collected along the Norfolk and Suffolk\r\ncoasts, within his own cognizance, must have belonged to upwards of\r\nfive hundred individuals.\r\n\r\n[780] _Geol.

The cave of _Sophienhöhle_\r\n appears to be highly interesting; the stalactites remaining uninjured,\r\n and the ossiferous floor in the state in which it was discovered;\r\n whilst the much-frequented caverns have been stripped of every relic\r\n by the spoliations of visitors during the last century and a half.\r\n\r\n \"The northern part of Bavaria, which is denominated 'Franconian\r\n Switzerland,' is situated about the centre of a triangle, formed\r\n between Bamberg on the N.W., Bayreuth N.E., and Nuremberg S.; the best\r\n road from this latter city diverging beyond Erlangen to the north.\r\n\r\n \"The nearest route from London is through Belgium, from Ostend or\r\n Antwerp, by the line of railroad which (since October, 1843) passes\r\n on from Liege and Verviers, by Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne. Thence by\r\n steam up the Rhine, by Coblentz to Mayence, and again by railway to\r\n Frankfort. In summer there are steam boats up and down the Maine,\r\n as far as Wurzburg, daily, and higher up, between Schweinfurt and\r\n Bamberg, which latter distance is performed in eight hours going up.\r\n and five down. Or there is a diligence (_eilwagen_) from Frankfort\r\n direct to Nuremberg, from which place (or Bamberg, &c.) a carriage\r\n must be hired to Muggendorf, the principal village of that interesting\r\n district. It lies about half way on the post road between Erlangen and\r\n Bayreuth, and has two tolerable country inns; the people are civil,\r\n and moderate in their charges, at least for the freshest trout and\r\n good wine of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n \"This charming spot and neighbourhood attracts not only the geologist\r\n and lover of the picturesque, but also the angler, who finds\r\n excellent fishing in the clear, rapidly-winding streams of the\r\n Wiesent, with its tributary waters, all of which are romantically\r\n placed in the suddenly deep dales of this table-land. The Wiesent\r\n flows through Forchheim into the Regnitz, westward, and this into the\r\n Maine, north.\r\n\r\n \"As to the time necessary to get there, during the summer days it\r\n would only require one to pass through Belgium to Aix, including the\r\n transit of this frontier into Prussia, with slight search of baggage.\r\n Then, in between four and five hours to Cologne, where the steamers\r\n generally wait for the arrival of these trains; and, taking the first\r\n boat up, it is possible to reach Bingen (if not Mayence late) the\r\n same evening. From Frankfort, by diligence, starting at 11 A.M., and\r\n travelling all night, Nuremberg may be reached on the second day; and\r\n the centre of operations, about Muggendorf, on the fifth from quitting\r\n the sea-coast. In returning by the Maine,--from Wurzburg to Mayence\r\n maybe performed in one long day, and then on the Rhine, the descent\r\n being much quicker than the upward course against the streams, the\r\n return homewards may be accomplished in one day less.\r\n\r\n \"The nearest way to Ostend is by the South-Eastern Railroad to Dover,\r\n and embark for Belgium.\r\n\r\n \"The newly-discovered cave, called _Sophienhöhle_, lies on the\r\n right bank of a streamlet, which gives its name to a romantic and\r\n rocky valley, _Ahorn-thal_, and flows S.W. toward Gösweinstein,\r\n until it falls into the Wiesent. The situation of the cave is near\r\n Klaustemerhöhle, and opposite to Ludwigshöhle: and it is far easier\r\n of access than Gailenreuth, and may be inspected by ladies with the\r\n greatest facility. An intelligent female showed us through its lofty\r\n and interesting details. This cave is nearly 300 feet wide, and 150\r\n feet in height. The quantity of fossil bones strewed about the floor\r\n was very great, notwithstanding many of the finest specimens had been\r\n removed, and were to be seen in the neighbouring castle of Count\r\n S----; added to this, the long, pendant curtains of stalactite, and\r\n the stupendous size of the cavern, contributed to make it appear\r\n to me far surpassing in interest that near Gailenreuth, called\r\n _Zoolithen-Höhle_, which I had visited the day before. The keys of\r\n this cavern--for this, as well as the other celebrated caves, is\r\n locked up, to guard against depredations--are kept at the large farm\r\n or steward’s house, hard by. The state of the weather prevented our\r\n visiting Forstershöhle (_Forest Cavern_), which lies further N.E.\r\n beyond the little town of Weischenfeld, near Zeubach; but which, we\r\n were informed, was equal in interest to this of Sophienhöhle. The\r\n tourist desirous of visiting this interesting district, will find Mr.\r\n Murray’s Handbook of Southern Germany an excellent guide: I can vouch\r\n for its accuracy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT.\r\n\r\n  _\"Ce que nous connaissons est peu de chose; ce que nous ignorons\r\n    est immense.\"_\r\n\r\n                                                    La Place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the close of this argument; we have taken a\r\ngeneral survey of the fossilized relics of the various classes of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, and have explained the methods by which\r\nthe inscriptions on these \"Medals of Creation\" may be deciphered.\r\n\r\nBut numerous as are the facts that have passed in review before us,\r\nand great as the accession of geological knowledge has been during\r\nthe last fifty years, the data hitherto obtained are insufficient to\r\nelucidate many of the obscure pages of the earth’s physical history;\r\nand to future discoveries must be left the full interpretation of many\r\nphenomena as yet obscurely presented to us.\r\n\r\nIn vain we endeavour to penetrate the veil which shrouds from our\r\nview many of the mighty events that preceded the history of our race,\r\nfor,--although the shades of colossal and unknown forms belonging to\r\nthe remote ages of a past eternity obey the spell of the true magician\r\nScience,--yet of the innumerable beings which through countless\r\ncenturies\r\n\r\n    \"The Earth has gather’d to her breast again,\r\n     And yet again, the millions that were born\r\n     Of her unnumber’d, unremember’d tribes--\"\r\n\r\nhow few, comparatively, could even the transcendent genius of Cuvier\r\nreveal!\r\n\r\nIf we endeavour to trace the order of succession, in which the extinct\r\nand existing types of animal and vegetable organization have appeared\r\nupon the face of our globe, as demonstrated by fossil remains, we at\r\nonce perceive how imperfectly our knowledge enables us to present\r\na true picture of the development of organic life as it existed in\r\nthe remotest ages. Ascending from the _Granite_--that shroud which\r\nconceals for ever from human ken the earliest scenes of the earth’s\r\nphysical drama--the first glimpses we obtain of animated nature are a\r\nfew sea-weeds, shells, and Crustacea. But can we doubt for a moment\r\nthat that ancient sea had its boundaries and its shores--that then,\r\nas now, there were islands and continents, and hills and valleys, and\r\nstreams and rivers, teeming with appropriate inhabitants? The little\r\nLycopodiaceous seed-vessels in the Ludlow bone-bed afford as certain\r\nindication of dry land, as the olive branch which the dove brought back\r\nto the Ark; one fact of this kind overthrows a host of theories based\r\nupon negative evidence.\r\n\r\nThroughout the lower palæozoic rocks organic life presents numerous\r\nmodifications; and the remains of small placoid fishes appear in the\r\nuppermost Silurian. In the Devonian we meet with rare reptilian remains\r\nand foot-prints. In the Carboniferous rocks the sauroid Batrachians\r\nhave left their relics and their foot-tracks. In the succeeding\r\nperiod these reptiles predominate; and on the sands of the Triassic\r\nocean we have the foot-prints of monster reptiles and the tracks of\r\nbipeds--colossal bird-footed creatures--of which no other vestiges\r\nremain, and to which the existing order of creation affords no parallel.\r\n\r\nThe last bed of the Trias affords the first indication of Mammalian\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon that marvellous epoch, during which reptilian\r\norganization obtained its fullest development--when the Iguanodon and\r\nMegalosaurus--\r\n\r\n    \"Mighty Pre-Adamites who walked the earth,\r\n     Of which ours is the wreck--\"\r\n\r\n                                                Byron.\r\n\r\nwere the principal inhabitants of vast islands and continents. But\r\nhere, as at an earlier period, we have proof that warm-blooded animals\r\nexisted; and the diminutive marsupial insectivorous Mammalia of the\r\nOolite and the birds of the Wealden attest that the system of animal\r\ncreation was complete.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind us the Age of Reptiles, we approach that of the colossal\r\nMammalia, when extensive countries were peopled by the enormous\r\nherbivorous Megatheres, the Mastodons, and gigantic Pachyderms, long\r\nsince become extinct. But with these lost forms many existing races\r\nwere contemporary; including the Monkey tribes, which, of all animals,\r\napproach nearest to man in their physical organization. Thus, by slow\r\nand almost insensible gradations, we arrive at the present state of\r\nanimate and inanimate nature. But even after the existing continents\r\nhad attained their present configuration, in the period immediately\r\nantecedent to the human epoch, innumerable tribes of carnivorous\r\nanimals swarmed throughout the temperate climates of Europe; the Tiger,\r\nHyæna, and Bear prowled through the woods and inhabited the caverns;\r\nand the Horse and Elephant, with gigantic Deer and Oxen, tenanted the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nBut of Man and of his works not a vestige appears throughout the vast\r\nperiods embraced in this review. Yet were any of the existing islands\r\nor continents to be engulphed in the depths of the ocean, and loaded\r\nwith marine detritus, and in future ages be elevated above the waters,\r\ncovered with consolidated mud and sand, how different would be the\r\ncharacters of those strata from any which have preceded them! Their\r\nmost striking features would be the remains of Man, and the productions\r\nof human art--the domes of his temples, the columns of his palaces,\r\nthe arches of his stupendous bridges of iron and stone, the ruins of\r\nhis towns and cities, and the durable remains of his earthly tenement\r\nimbedded in the rocks and strata--these would be the \"Medals of\r\nCreation\" of the _Human Epoch_, and transmit to the remotest periods of\r\ntime a faithful record of the present condition of the surface of the\r\nearth, and of its inhabitants.[781]\r\n\r\n[781] See Sir H.

But from\r\nwant of space, only one or two excursions can be described in detail;\r\nand I must restrict myself in a great measure to extracts from my\r\nnote-book, and explanatory remarks and suggestions for the guidance\r\nof the student and collector.

For this purpose, the following articles will\r\nbe found more or less requisite, according to the particular object of\r\nthe collector:--\r\n\r\n1. A hammer of one of the forms figured in _Lign. 266_. Fig. 3 will be\r\nfound most generally useful.\r\n\r\n2. A leather or strong camlet bag, and one or two of smaller size; the\r\nformer with strings, or with a strap for the shoulder. If travelling in\r\na carriage, a box or basket may also be provided.\r\n\r\n3. Stout and thin paper, and some of a soft kind, for wrapping up\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n4. Chip boxes, and raw cotton, wadding, or tow, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n5. String, sealing-wax, and writing paper gummed on one side, for\r\nlabels to affix to specimens on the spot.\r\n\r\n6. A strong pair of gloves, and a pair of eye preservers; common\r\nspectacle frames covered with fine black crape will be more agreeable\r\nthan glass.\r\n\r\n7. A measuring tape, a pocket compass, and drawing materials will be\r\nrequired, if the observer intend to note the geological characters of\r\nthe district.[783]\r\n\r\n[783] On the construction of geological maps and sections, see the\r\nAppendix to De la Beche’s _Geological Observer_.\r\n\r\n8. A good geological map of the country; if this cannot be procured,\r\nthe best geographical map.\r\n\r\n9. A strong double-bladed knife; one or more chisels.\r\n\r\n10. A pocket set of single lenses of three powers, to examine minute\r\nobjects; blank memorandum books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 266. Geological and Mineralogical Hammers.\r\n\r\n Fig. 1 and 4, 6, are adapted for breaking large stones or masses of\r\n hard rock; the thinner ends are convenient for splitting and trimming\r\n fragments to a moderate size. The head should be from four to five\r\n inches long, one and a half inch wide on the crown, and from two to\r\n three pounds in weight; the length of the handle from eighteen to\r\n twenty inches.\r\n\r\n 2 and 3.--This is my favourite hammer, and will be found most\r\n generally useful; the short square head for breaking, and the pick\r\n for splitting stones, and extracting fossils of moderate size; weight\r\n of the head two pounds, length seven inches; width of the crown one\r\n and a half inch; handle from twelve to fourteen inches long, and one\r\n inch wide at the lower part, for the convenience of a firm hold. If\r\n the handle be graduated as a foot measure, as in _fig._ 5, it will be\r\n found useful.[782]\r\n\r\n [782] Hammers of this kind may be obtained at Messrs. Knight’s,\r\nFoster-lane, London; and at 49, Cockspur-street, Charing Cross: care\r\nshould be taken that the heads are of well-tempered steel, and the\r\nhandles of tough wood.\r\n\r\n 5 and 8, 7, are smaller hammers for breaking and chipping stones and\r\n minerals; the heads from three to four inches long, and one and a half\r\n pound in weight; the handle one foot long.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch are the articles that will be required for a geological excursion\r\nintended to comprehend a scientific examination of a district; but\r\nfor a mere trip to collect fossil remains, several may be dispensed\r\nwith. Some years since, an eminent geologist, Dr. Fitton, drew up\r\nsome excellent instructions for collecting specimens, for the use of\r\nthe party employed under Captain King to survey the Western coast of\r\nAustralia; by permission of the author, they are here subjoined.[784]\r\n\r\n[784] For the collection of rock specimens, and for the mode of\r\nobserving the phenomena of physical geology, Sir H. De la Beche s\r\ninstructive volume, \"_How to Observe_,\" should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\n \"It may be proper to premise, that two of the principal objects\r\n of geological inquiry are, to determine--1st, the nature of the\r\n _materials_ of which the earth is composed: and, 2dly, the relative\r\n _order_ in which these materials are disposed in relation to each\r\n other.\r\n\r\n \"1. Specimens of rocks ought not, in general, to be taken from loose\r\n pieces, but from large masses in their native place, or which have\r\n recently fallen from their natural situation.\r\n\r\n \"2. The specimens should consist of the stone unchanged by exposure to\r\n the elements, which sometimes alter the characters to a considerable\r\n depth from the surface. Petrifactions, however, are often best\r\n distinguishable in masses somewhat decomposed; and are thus even\r\n rendered visible in many cases where no trace of any organized body\r\n can be discerned in the recent fracture.\r\n\r\n \"3. The specimens ought not to be very small;--about three inches\r\n square, and three quarters of an inch in thickness, is a convenient\r\n size.\r\n\r\n \"4. seldom happens that large masses, even of the same kind of rock,\r\n are uniform throughout any considerable space; so that the general\r\n character is ascertained by geologists, who examine rocks in their\r\n native places, from the average of an extensive surface. A collection\r\n ought, therefore, to embrace specimens of the most characteristic\r\n varieties; and _the most splendid examples are, in general, not the\r\n most instructive_. Where several specimens are taken from the same\r\n place, a series of numbers should be added to the note of their\r\n locality.\r\n\r\n \"5. One of the most advantageous situations for obtaining specimens\r\n and examining the relations of rocks is in the sections afforded\r\n by cliffs on the sea-shore; especially after recent falls of large\r\n masses, t commonly happens that the beds thus exposed are more or\r\n less inclined; and in this case, if any of them be inaccessible at a\r\n particular point, the decline of the strata will frequently enable\r\n the collector to supply himself with the required specimens, within a\r\n short distance.\r\n\r\n \"6. To examine the _interior_ of an unknown country, more skill and\r\n practice are required; the rocks being generally concealed by the\r\n soil, accumulations of sand, gravel, &c., and by the vegetation of\r\n the surface. But the strata are commonly disclosed in the sides of\r\n ravines,--in the beds of rivers and mountain-streams; and these,\r\n especially where they cross the direction of the strata, may be found,\r\n by careful examination, to afford instructive sections.\r\n\r\n \"The mud and gravel in the beds of rivers and in deltas often contain\r\n grains of _gold_, _platina_, and other native metals, rubies,\r\n sapphires, and other precious stones; and a general knowledge of the\r\n rocks of an unexplored country often may be gained from the detritus\r\n at the embouchure of a river.\r\n\r\n \"7. Among the contents of the strata, the remains of organized\r\n bodies,--shells, corals and other zoophytes,--the bones and teeth of\r\n animals,--wood, and the impressions of vegetable stems, roots, or\r\n leaves, &c. are of the greatest importance; affording generally the\r\n most marked characters of the beds in which they occur. These should,\r\n therefore, be particularly sought after, and their relative abundance\r\n or rarity in different situations noticed. The fossils should, if\r\n possible, be kept united with portions of the rock or matrix in which\r\n they are found; and where they are numerous,--in sand, clay, or any\r\n moist or friable matrix,--it is, in general, better to retain a large\r\n portion of the whole mass, to be examined afterwards, than to attempt\r\n their separation at the time of collecting.\r\n\r\n \"8. The _loose substances_ which are found above the solid rocks, in\r\n the form of gravel, silt, rolled pebbles, &c., should be carefully\r\n distinguished from the _solid strata_ upon which they rest. And the\r\n more ancient of these water-worn materials, found on the sides or\r\n summits of hills, &c., should be distinguished from the recent mud,\r\n sand, and gravel, brought down by land-floods or by rivers. The bones\r\n and teeth of quadrupeds are not unfrequently found in the more ancient\r\n gravel; and the collection of these remains from distant quarters of\r\n the globe is an object of the greatest interest to geology.\r\n\r\n \"9. Besides a note of the locality, there ought, if possible,\r\n to accompany every specimen a short notice of its geological\r\n circumstances; as, for example, whether it be found in large shapeless\r\n masses, or in strata? If in strata,--what are the thickness,\r\n inclination to the horizon, and direction with respect to the compass,\r\n of the beds? If these cannot be measured, an estimate should always\r\n be recorded while the objects are in view. Are they uniform in dip\r\n and direction?--curved, or contorted?--continuous, or interrupted by\r\n fissures or veins? Is the whole cliff, or mass of strata in sight, of\r\n uniform composition?--or does it consist of different kinds of stone?\r\n If the strata be different, what is the order in which they are placed\r\n above each other successively?\r\n\r\n \"10. A _label_, distinctly written, should accompany every specimen,\r\n stating its native place, its relative situation, &c., and these\r\n labels should be attached to the specimens immediately, on the spot\r\n where they were found. This injunction may appear to be superfluous;\r\n but so much valuable information has been lost to geology from the\r\n neglect of it, that every observer of experience will acknowledge its\r\n necessity. It is useful to mark on the labels the day, and even the\r\n hour, when each specimen is collected. This, with a corresponding\r\n note in the memorandum-book, prevents confusion, and will be found to\r\n assist the memory.\r\n\r\n \"11. A _sketch_ of a coast or cliff, however slight, frequently\r\n conveys more information respecting the disposition and relations of\r\n rocks, than a long memorandum. If numbers, denoting the situation\r\n of the specimens collected, be marked upon such sketches, much time\r\n may be saved at the moment of collecting. But in all such cases,\r\n the memorandum should be looked over soon afterwards, and labels,\r\n distinctly explaining their situation, &c. be attached to the\r\n specimens.\r\n\r\n \"12. The specimens should be so packed, that the surfaces may be\r\n defended from exposure to air, moisture, and friction: for which\r\n purpose, if strong paper cannot be obtained, dry moss, or straw,\r\n or leaves may be employed. Where paper is used for wrapping the\r\n specimens, they are best secured by fastening the envelope with\r\n sealing-wax.\r\n\r\n \"Lastly. The collector must not be discouraged, nor be prevented from\r\n collecting, by finding that the place which he may chance to visit in\r\n a remote situation has not a stinking appearance, or the rocks within\r\n his view a very interesting character; _since it frequently, and even\r\n commonly happens, that facts and specimens, in themselves of very\r\n little importance, become valuable by subsequent comparison; so that\r\n scarcely any observation, if recorded with accuracy, will be thrown\r\n away_.\"\r\n\r\nThese general instructions will suffice to prepare the reader for an\r\nexcursion to some known locality, where his researches will certainly\r\nbe rewarded by many interesting organic remains; and he may be so\r\nfortunate as to meet with some rare fossils, and perhaps with one or\r\ntwo that have not previously been discovered; for there is always a\r\nchance of finding relics hitherto unknown, even in a cliff or quarry\r\nthat is daily visited by collectors. And as an old sportsman desirous\r\nof inspiring a novice with a love of field sports, takes him at first\r\nto preserves where game is plentiful, in like manner I would initiate\r\nmy reader in the delightful pursuit of collecting _Medals of Creation_,\r\nby conducting him to a spot where these antiquities of nature are\r\nscattered about in great profusion and variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nEXCURSIONS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AND ORGANIC\r\nREMAINS OF THE TERTIARY DEPOSITS OF THE LONDON BASIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn leaving London for any part of England, the reader will remember\r\nthat the area on which the metropolis is situated, as well as the\r\nsurrounding district to a distance varying from a radius of ten to\r\ntwenty or thirty miles, consists of the marine Tertiary _eocene_\r\nstrata (see p. 24), which have been deposited in, and still occupy,\r\na depression, or excavation of the Chalk, called the _London Basin_\r\n(_Wond._ p. 229). Around this formation, the Chalk forms a distinct\r\nboundary on the south, west, and north, rising up into chains of hills\r\nor downs; but on the east the range is broken, and the Tertiary basin\r\nlies open to the sea, affording a passage for the Thames and its\r\ntributary streams. From this geological character of the metropolitan\r\ndistrict, it results, that all the lines of railroad proceeding from\r\nLondon traverse, for the first ten or twenty miles, beds of clay, loam,\r\nand loosely aggregated sand and gravel; hence the numerous slips that\r\nhave taken place in the embankments; as for example, at New Cross,\r\nWandsworth Common, near Hanwell, &c.; and in all these lines it is\r\nobvious, from the nature of the strata and the steepness of many of the\r\ncuttings, that similar catastrophes will again occur.\r\n\r\nThe next geological feature observable in the lines of all the\r\nLondon railroads is the Chalk, which is invariably passed either\r\nby steep cuttings, or tunnels, or both; as for example, from near\r\nCroydon to Merstham, by the South-Eastern; from near Basingstoke to\r\nbeyond Winchester, by the South-Western; from Maidenhead to beyond\r\nWallingford, by the Great Western; and from beyond Watford to near\r\nIvinghoe, by the Birmingham line.\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the Chalk, and over the marls and sandstone\r\nstrata of the Cretaceous formation, the Oolitic group (consisting of\r\nPortland stone, Kimmeridge clay, &c.), the Lias, New Red or Triassic,\r\nand Carboniferous deposits successively appear on the lines of\r\nrailroad; excepting on those of the South-Eastern, which, upon leaving\r\nthe Chalk-formation, traverse the fluviatile beds of the Wealden, as we\r\nshall hereafter more particularly describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCURSION TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that Sheppey is a small island about ten miles in\r\nlength, lying at the mouth of the Thames, at the distance of between\r\nforty and fifty miles east from London; but every one does not\r\nknow that the Isle of Sheppey is an inexhaustible mine of fossil\r\ntreasures; and that from its cliffs, and on its shores, may be gathered\r\ninnumerable relics of tropical plants, of quadrupeds, birds, serpents,\r\nturtles, fishes, crabs, lobsters, shells, &c. all belonging to species\r\nthat now no longer exist.\r\n\r\nA visit to the town of Queenborough afforded me, when a boy, the\r\nfirst opportunity of beholding fossil remains in such a state of\r\npreservation, and in such profusion, as to excite in my mind an\r\nuncontrollable desire to investigate the nature and origin of objects\r\nwhich I had been taught to believe were either produced spontaneously\r\nin the earth, or were left in their present situations by the waters\r\nof a universal deluge. At a short distance from the inn where we\r\nsojourned, was a vitriol manufactory, and considerable plots of ground\r\nwere covered with the pyritous clay, obtained from the neighbourhood.\r\nTo my great astonishment, I perceived that masses of this fossil earth\r\nwere almost wholly made up of stems, twigs, and fragments of wood, with\r\ninnumerable fruits, seed-vessels, and berries, of kinds altogether\r\nunknown to me. These fossils were of a dark colour, some quite black,\r\nvery heavy, and permeated with the mineral substance termed sulphuret\r\nof iron, or pyrites. Many were so brittle as to fall to pieces upon\r\nbeing handled, but others were of a stony hardness, and I quickly\r\nfilled a handkerchief with my newly discovered treasures, and hastened\r\nhome to examine them at leisure. They consisted of the usual kinds of\r\nfossil fruits so abundant in the island (see _Lign._ 63 and 64, p.\r\n188), with casts of shells, and a few claws of crabs, and teeth of\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nMost of the specimens fell to pieces in the course of three or four\r\nmonths, but a few were durable, and these still occupy a corner in\r\nmy cabinet as precious mementos of my juvenile researches. Many\r\nyears afterwards I revisited Sheppey, and made a large collection of\r\nits fossils, which is now in the British Museum. Of late years, the\r\nincreasing taste for Palæontology has brought numerous visitors to\r\nthe island, which steam navigation has now placed within a few hours’\r\ndistance of the metropolis; and the demand for choice fossils has\r\ngiven rise to several local dealers. The student may, with but little\r\ntrouble or expense, visit the island, make himself familiar with its\r\ngeological character, and return laden with the fruits of the ancient\r\nspice islands, of whose ruins this mass of clay, in the embouchure of\r\nthe Thames, is almost wholly composed. As it is some years since I\r\nlast visited this interesting spot, I have obtained, as a Cicerone for\r\nthe reader, the most indefatigable and successful investigator of its\r\nfossil Flora, Mr. Bowerbank; and as the courtesy of this gentleman is\r\nequal to his intelligence and scientific attainments, the traveller\r\nwill have no reason to regret the absence of the author. A trip from\r\nLondon to Sheppey and back, affording time to procure a good collection\r\nof fossils, may be easily accomplished in three days.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCURSION TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY, BY J. S. BOWERBANK, ESQ. F.R.S.[785]\r\n\r\n[785] Abridged from the Annals of Philosophy, by permission of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n\"The best conveyance is by the Southend and Sheerness steam-packets,\r\nwhich leave London-bridge on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, at 11\r\no’clock in the morning, and reach Sheerness about 4 or 5 o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon. The town is divided into two parts,--the one contained\r\nwithin the limits of the garrison being designated the Blue town,\r\nwhile that beyond the fortifications to the north-east is designated\r\nthe Mile-town; and it is to this portion that I should recommend the\r\nvisitor to proceed, and take up his quarters either at the Royal\r\nHotel, or at the Wellington: the latter is an exceedingly snug and\r\ncomfortable house, to which I have resorted for many years. After\r\nhaving established himself in the inn, he should request the attendance\r\nof Mr. Hays (better known perhaps by the name of _Paddy Hays_), from\r\nwhom he may purchase, at a reasonable rate, some good fossils, such as\r\ncrabs, lobsters, heads and portions of fishes, and numerous species of\r\nfossil fruits. Our traveller will then have accomplished all that can\r\nbe done towards the acquisition of fossils until the following morning;\r\nthere not being, I believe, any other collector in the town from whom\r\npurchases can be made.\r\n\r\n\"On the following morning an early breakfast is desirable, as a\r\nconsiderable extent of ground is to be traversed. It is advisable to\r\ngo provided with live or six sheets of soft paper, to wrap fragile\r\nspecimens in; and a few cotton or linen bags, of about four or five\r\ninches in diameter, to separate the large from the small fossils; the\r\nwhole to be carried in a good-sized blue bag, or haversack; a chisel\r\nand light hammer are the only instruments required. If the geologist\r\nhas a desire to view the great section of the London Clay, afforded\r\nby the cliffs on the north shore of Sheppey, and is content with the\r\ncomparatively few fossils which he may be able to procure by his own\r\nexertions, he may proceed in the following manner:--Leaving Sheerness\r\nby the new town, he will pass along the sea-wall, towards Minster,\r\nuntil he reaches Scaps-gate, where the cliffs begin to rise from the\r\nlow lands of the western end of Sheppey. A few cottages are scattered\r\nround this point, some of the inhabitants of which work upon the beach,\r\ncollecting either cement-stone or _pyrites_, the latter being better\r\nknown by the name of _copperas_. To these application should be made\r\nfor ‘curiosities,’ and very frequently excellent specimens, and at a\r\nsmall price, may be thus procured. From this point the route will be\r\nunder the cliffs upon the shingle, amidst which, dark patches, ten\r\nor fifteen yards in length, will be observed, composed of nodules of\r\n_pyrites_, intermixed with pyritized fragments of branches of trees, in\r\ngreat abundance. It is at such spots that the numerous and beautiful\r\nspecimens of fossil fruits are found; but, to ensure success, the\r\ncollector must be content to go upon his knees, and carefully search\r\namong the fragments. The whole of the beach, from about the parallel\r\nof Minster church to Warden Point, abounds with these patches of\r\n_pyrites_; and I have by this means obtained in the course of a morning\r\nupwards of one hundred fine fruits of various sizes. Care must be taken\r\nin such an investigation of the coast, that it be undertaken during the\r\nfalling of the tide, or unpleasant consequences may arise from being\r\nshut in between the banks of mud which are projected into the sea at\r\nmany points of the coast.\r\n\r\n\"If the principal object be the attainment of the greatest quantity of\r\nfossils, a different course should be pursued. The collector should\r\nthen, after having made his purchases at Scaps-gate, direct his steps\r\ntowards Minster church, passing which, he will proceed on the road\r\ntowards Warden. About three-quarters of a mile beyond the church there\r\nis a lane on the left hand, leading towards the Royal Oak, in which\r\nlives a woman named Mummery, and several others, who work upon the\r\nbeach, and from whom fossils are frequently to be procured. These\r\npeople will direct him to the cottage of a family named Crockford, who\r\nhave usually a good assortment of fossils; and to many other parties\r\nwho also work upon the beach, and reside between this point and\r\nHensbrook, to which place he must now direct his steps. At Hensbrook\r\ninquiry should be made for a man named Pead, who has generally a\r\nconsiderable number of good specimens in his possession. From this\r\npoint (Hensbrook) the collector must proceed along the top of the cliff\r\ntowards Warden, calling at the various cottages in his way, until he\r\narrives at Warden Point, at which place he must inquire for Mud-row,\r\nmany of the inhabitants of which work upon the beach, and from whom\r\na considerable addition to the specimens already collected may be\r\npurchased. Beyond this point nothing will be obtained, and the best\r\nway to return to Sheerness, is by the road which runs through the most\r\nlevel portion of the country; the path along the north cliff undulates\r\nvery considerably more than the road.\r\n\r\n\"The course of proceeding thus sketched applies to the supposition\r\nthat the time is limited to three days, but if a longer period can be\r\nspared, I should recommend the tourist not to leave Sheerness without\r\nviewing the dock-yard; and the return to London may be made by the\r\nway of Chatham and Gravesend, affording the gratification of a view of\r\nthe dock-yard and lines at Chatham, and of the fine old cathedral and\r\ncastle at Rochester; at the same time, enabling him to arrive in London\r\non the evening of the day that he quits Sheerness.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HERNE BAY. GRAVESEND.]\r\n\r\nIf the student’s time will permit, a day or two may be profitably spent\r\nat Herne Bay on his return; and search should be made for fossils under\r\nSwale Cliff and Studd Hill, where numerous fruits and some unique\r\nmammalian remains have been found by William Richardson, Esq. (see p.\r\n791). Should he land at Gravesend, as recommended by Mr. Bowerbank,\r\nhe should proceed towards the lime-kilns which lie on the London side\r\nof the pier, on the right bank of the Thames. To the left of the\r\nlime-kilns he will perceive a road leading by some bold chalk cliffs to\r\nthe high ground above Gravesend; and on the right hand there is a row\r\nof cottages, or rather huts, inhabited by the labourers that work in\r\nthe quarries and kilns. Many of the usual fossils of the Kentish Chalk\r\nmay be obtained of the women or children in these huts; and sometimes\r\n_Cidares_, or turban Echinites (p. 314), with spines; and Star-fish\r\n(p. 306). A visit to the chalk-pits at Purfleet, on the opposite side\r\nof the river, is very desirable; many interesting fossils having been\r\nfound in that locality. The Kentish Chalk in this district is much\r\nsofter than that of Sussex, and the fossils may be easily cleared with\r\na penknife, or by brushing in water; care should be taken not to wash\r\nthem roughly, as they will readily separate from the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe fossils procured from the Isle of Sheppey, by such an excursion,\r\nwill probably consist of portions of stems and branches of trees, and\r\nfragments of wood, perforated by Teredines (see p. 193); specimens of\r\nthe fruits of palms, resembling the recent _Nipas_ of the Moluccas (p.\r\n188), and of plants allied to the Cucumber, Bean, Cypress, Laburnum,\r\n&c. (p. 189); claws and fragments of the shields of Crabs (p. 512);\r\nbones of Crocodiles, Serpents, and Turtles; bones and teeth of Sharks\r\n(p. 591); Rays (p. 598), and other fishes; and several species of the\r\nusual shells of the London Clay (p. 383), and a specimen or two of\r\nNautilus (p. 469).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR AN EXCURSION TO BRACKLESHAM BAT, ON THE WESTERN COAST OF\r\nSUSSEX.\r\n\r\nThe line of low cliffs extending from Selsea Bill to the mouth of\r\nChichester Harbour exhibits a section of the Eocene deposits, varying\r\nin height from five or six feet to ten or twelve; it is covered at its\r\nbase by a bed of shingle, fifteen or twenty yards wide, that extends\r\ntowards the sea. The space between the termination of the shingle and\r\nthe limit of low-water-mark is occupied by a bed of dark grey and\r\ngreenish sand; and at certain seasons, numberless specimens of the\r\nfossil shells common in the Eocene strata of the London and Paris\r\nbasins are thickly spread over this area.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster first directed attention to this locality, in his\r\ncelebrated Memoir on the Tertiary Strata of England; and my friend, the\r\nlate John Hawkins, Esq. of Bignor Park, followed up the inquiry. In\r\n1821 I made a fine collection of the Bracklesham fossils, and published\r\na list of them in _Foss. South D._ and _Geol. S. E._ Messrs. Bowerbank,\r\nSaull, Dixon, Coombe, &c. have subsequently made considerable and\r\nimportant additions to the catalogue; and besides many new species\r\nof shells, the vertebræ and other bones of Turtles, Serpents, and\r\nCrocodiles have been discovered. An excellent notice of this locality,\r\nfrom the pen of Mr. Bowerbank, appeared in _Mag. Nat. Hist._ (1840);\r\nand I am indebted to the kindness of the author for the following notes\r\nfor the guidance of my readers.\r\n\r\n \"The part of the bay most interesting to the geologist is that\r\n immediately in the neighbourhood of Bracklesham Barn, especially at\r\n about a furlong to the east of that spot, where there is a small\r\n break or chine in the low clay cliff. At this place, and at a few\r\n paces east and west of it, beneath about six or seven feet of clay,\r\n there is a stratum of light green marly sand, abounding in remains\r\n of _Venericardia planicosta_ and other shells, but which is often\r\n entirely hidden by thrown-up shingle, and it is very rarely that more\r\n than a few feet in length of this bed can be seen. It is from this\r\n bed, or from one exceedingly like it, somewhat lower in the series,\r\n that perhaps most of the interesting shells of this district are to\r\n be procured. If we proceed from this little break or chine westward,\r\n for about forty paces parallel to the coast, and then in the direction\r\n of a line at right angles to the cliff, and at the time of low water,\r\n we shall find, near the low-water-mark, the bed we have described as\r\n abounding in fossils exposed by the action of the sea in the most\r\n favourable manner. At this spot _Venericardia planicosta_ is found\r\n literally by thousands, with the valves united, the shells resting\r\n upon their edges, and packed close to each other, exactly in the\r\n manner that we might expect to have found them, supposing them to have\r\n been recent shells with the animals yet inhabiting them. Comparatively\r\n very few are gaping, and their condition and position strikingly\r\n impress upon the mind the idea that when alive they must have\r\n inhabited the spot from which they are now disinterred; especially\r\n as there are numerous small and fragile species of other well-known\r\n London Clay shells, which could not have remained whole had they\r\n been subjected to much attrition amid the larger shells surrounding\r\n them. On the sands in the vicinity of this spot, I found large masses\r\n of _Nummulites lævigatus_ cemented together, and numerous detached\r\n specimens of the same shell.\r\n\r\n \"At the eastern extremity of this bed, which, at the time of my visit,\r\n was opened for about fifty yards, I found _Sanguinolaria Hollowaysii_,\r\n a rare and fragile, but very beautiful shell, in a fine state of\r\n preservation. At about twenty or thirty yards westward of the western\r\n end of this interesting patch of shells, there are large blocks of\r\n this bed, which, being of a firmer texture than the surrounding parts\r\n of the deposit, have suffered less from the action of the water, and\r\n project about twelve or eighteen inches above the surrounding sand,\r\n and, by presenting an obstruction to the ebbing tide, they usually\r\n induce the formation of a small pool amidst which they stand. At the\r\n south-eastern side of this pool on one occasion I found the stratum,\r\n which is usually covered by the sand, completely exposed. At this\r\n spot there was scarcely a specimen of _Venericardia planicosta_ to be\r\n seen, but instead of this shell, _Turritella conoidea_ and _T. edita_\r\n were imbedded in a dark green marly sand; and among them, together\r\n with _Fusus longævus_ and other well-known London Clay shells, I\r\n found _Venericardia acuticostata_ and _V. mitis_, and a splendid\r\n specimen of _Conus deperditus_, fully equal in size to the one figured\r\n by Deshayes. Westward of this point I did not meet with anything\r\n particularly interesting.\r\n\r\n \"About midway between Bracklesham Barn and the Thorney coast-guard\r\n station, a series of patches of a deposit of chalk-flints was exposed;\r\n the first of these was nearly at low-water-mark, and the remainder\r\n of them ran, at short distances from each other, in a diagonal\r\n line towards the coast, nearly in the direction of a straight line\r\n drawn from their western extremity to the Thorney station-houses.\r\n Apparently, this stratum of flints has not, at any time, exceeded\r\n eight inches or a foot in thickness; they are, indeed, so thinly\r\n scattered, as rarely to occur piled upon each other: very few of\r\n them have suffered from attrition, and the greater part retain their\r\n original form and whitened surface. They are imbedded in the same\r\n light green marly sand which I before described as occurring at the\r\n bottom of the London Clay in the neighbourhood of the little chine\r\n near Bracklesham Barn. Amongst the flints there are numerous remains\r\n of the roots of trees, in the state of soft bog-wood; which indicate\r\n that this portion of the strata has been very thinly covered by the\r\n superimposed clay.\r\n\r\n \"Upon one of the bouldered flints, firmly imbedded in the marly sand.\r\n I found the most interesting of the valuable series of fossils which I\r\n had the good fortune to obtain during this excursion, namely, a fine\r\n specimen of _Astræa_[786] attached to the upper and exposed surface of\r\n a flint.\"\r\n\r\n[786] _Astræa_, a species of coral; see p. 262.\r\n\r\nAs to the accommodation that may be procured near this interesting\r\ngeological locality, Mr. Bowerbank informs me that homely fare can be\r\nobtained at the little inn at Bracklesham, but there is only one spare\r\nbed. At Selsea, about six miles distant, there is a much better inn.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR AN EXCURSION TO THE TERTIARY STRATA OF THE ISLE OF WIGHT.\r\n\r\n[See Geological Excursions round the Isle of Wight, and along the\r\nadjacent Coasts of Dorsetshire, by the Author. 8vo. 3d edit. With\r\nPrefatory Note by T. Rupert Jones. 1854. Bohn. London.]\r\n\r\nLand at Cowes; examine the blocks of fresh-water limestone along\r\nthe shore, which abound in shells. Drive to Alum Bay (_Wond._ p.\r\n241), taking Calbourn in your route, where there are quarries of the\r\nfresh-water limestone, with innumerable casts of Paludina, Helix,\r\nBulimus, &c. Put up at Groves’ Hotel, on the summit of the hill,\r\ncommanding a glorious view of Alum Bay, with the Hampshire coast, and\r\nthe Isle of Purbeck on the right, and Portland Island looming in the\r\nremote distance; and on the left, the vertical cliffs of Chalk, and\r\nthe Needles. The pathway that leads down to the sea-shore traverses a\r\nchasm, separating Headon-hill on the right, from Alum Bay on the left;\r\nin the former, fresh-water shells--in the vertical beds of clay, in the\r\nlatter, marine shells--may be obtained in great abundance and variety.\r\n\r\nIf you land at Ryde, the small quarries at Binstead are worthy of\r\nconstant research, for the chance of mammalian remains (see p. 791).\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the splendid work of Sir Henry Englefield\r\non the Isle of Wight describes certain geological changes still in\r\nprogress on the shore near Ryde, that are well deserving the visitor’s\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n \"A great and very singular change has taken place within no very\r\n distant period of time on the shores of the Solent, near to Ryde; and\r\n which seems to be still sensibly proceeding. When Fielding, in the\r\n year 1753, was at Ryde, on his voyage to Lisbon, he describes the town\r\n as totally inaccessible by sea except at or near high-water; as the\r\n tide, on its recess, left a vast extent of mud, too soft to bear the\r\n lightest weight. This mud-bank is now entirely covered by a stratum\r\n of fine white sand, smooth and firm enough to bear wheel-carriages,\r\n and which renders the bathing at all times safe and agreeable. This\r\n bed of sand now reaches to Binstead, having covered at least two miles\r\n of the shore within the last half-century; and the inhabitants say\r\n that it is still extending to the westward. On digging through the\r\n sand, the old mud presently appears, the sand stratum being very thin.\r\n To what cause this change is owing it is difficult to guess; but it\r\n is an example of the alternation of deposits from the action of the\r\n sea, in circumstances apparently unchanged, which may afford cause for\r\n reflection to the geologist.\"[787]\r\n\r\n[787] Sir H. Englefield’s Isle of Wight, p. 16.\r\n\r\nIf the visitor have leisure, he should make a tour of this interesting\r\nisland, from Ryde to Shanklin and Ventnor, along the beautiful scenery\r\nof the Under Cliff, formed by the slips of the Lower Green Sand; to\r\nBlack Gang Chine, and Fresh-water Bay; visiting Brook-Point (_Wond._ p.\r\n378) to collect fossils from the Wealden strata on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR A GEOLOGICAL EXCURSION, OVER THE CHALK AND WEALDEN FORMATIONS\r\nOF THE SOUTH-EAST OF ENGLAND, FROM LONDON TO BRIGHTON, AND FROM\r\nBRIGHTON TO ROTTINGDEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn travelling from London to Brighton by the railway, the following\r\ngeological features of the country may be observed; by a reference to\r\n_Wond._ p. 360, the structure of this remarkable district may be easily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nLeaving the station at London Bridge, the _London Clay_, with its\r\ncharacteristic fossils, is seen beyond Deptford, by New Cross,\r\nSydenham, &c.; and approaching Croydon, beds of gravel appear, with\r\ninterspersions of olive-green sand. These strata belong to the Eocene\r\nformation, and lie above and upon the Chalk. The valley beyond Croydon\r\n(Smitham Bottom), along the side of which the railroad is carried, is\r\ncomposed of gravel resting on chalk; beyond the station called _Stoat’s\r\nNest_, there is a fine section of the chalk, with layers of flint, and\r\ntwo parallel seams of marl, at the distance of six or eight feet from\r\neach other. These extend, with but little interruption, several miles,\r\npreserving their parallelism, although the strata in many places have\r\nsustained considerable disturbance. The Merstham Tunnel, through the\r\nSurrey chalk hills, is now entered. At Merstham the chalk, chalk-marl,\r\nand firestone are intersected, and the Lower Greensand of Red Hill\r\nappears; and from thence to Horley station, the lower sands and clays\r\nof the Chalk formation are passed over or cut through; affording\r\nsections of sandstone, ironstone, and fuller’s earth.\r\n\r\nThe strata we have hitherto traversed are of marine origin, and\r\ncontain fossil shells, fishes, Crustacea, &c., and remains of other\r\ninhabitants of former oceans. But we now enter upon the series of\r\nriver deposits[788] which form the Wealden, and contain the relics of\r\nterrestrial or fresh-water animals and plants.\r\n\r\n[788] A limited intercalation of a marine character occurs in the\r\nHasting Sands of Swanage Bay; this was discovered by Mr. R. A. C.\r\nAusten, and is noticed _Quart. Geol. Journ._ vol. vii. p. lix.\r\n\r\nAt Horley the weald clay appears, and is succeeded by sand, sandstone,\r\nand shale, to Crawley. Passing through the tunnel of the Wealden\r\nstrata, we arrive at Balcombe, where sandstone in laminæ and in thick\r\nbeds, having the surface at the lines of junction covered with ripple\r\nmarks, is seen on each side the railroad; the dip of the strata is to\r\nthe _north-east_. After crossing the deep valley at Balcombe, over\r\nthe magnificent viaduct, the line runs along alternations of sand and\r\nclay, dipping _south-west_; we have thus passed over what is termed the\r\nanticlinal axis of the Wealden. Arriving at Hayward’s Heath station,\r\nthe tunnel exposes a good section of the Wealden sand, sandstone,\r\nshale, and blue marl or oak-tree clay, to a depth of about thirty-six\r\nyards. The strata are disposed in the same order and thickness as\r\nin the quarries around Cuckfield; namely, fawn-coloured sand and\r\nsandstone, like those of Little Horsted, with beds of calciferous grit\r\nor Tilgate stone; and, beneath, layers of the blue clay. The strata are\r\nvery barren in organic remains; several hours’ research only afforded\r\nimperfect vegetable relics, such as comminuted stems and leaves of the\r\nvarious species of ferns, which occur in Tilgate Forest (see _Wond._ p.\r\n392). Some of the grey laminated sandstones and shales at this place\r\nvery closely resemble certain strata of the Coal measures.\r\n\r\nProceeding over the Weald clay with the Sussex marble of St.\r\nJohn’s Common, the line encounters the Lower Greensand of Sussex,\r\nat Stone-pound gate. Here then we quit the fresh-water strata\r\nof the Wealden, and again enter upon the marine deposits of the\r\nChalk-formation. At the foot of the northern escarpment of the South\r\ndowns, the Chalk is penetrated at the base of Clayton Hill, the\r\ntunnel running through the lower members of the Chalk--the Galt and\r\nChalk-marl--and emerging at Piecombe through the White Chalk; from\r\nthence to Brighton, the sections and tunnels intersect or perforate the\r\nsame cretaceous deposits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON AND BRIGHTON RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nIn our traverse we shall have seen that the various strata cut through,\r\nare repeated on the north and south of a line drawn from east to west\r\nthrough the Forest Ridge (see _Wond._ Geol. Map, pl. 1). Thus, the\r\nrailroad has to pass through two ranges of chalk hills by tunnels those\r\nof Merstham and Clayton; two principal ridges of Wealden strata--at\r\nBalcombe and Hayward’s Heath; and the Shanklin or Lower Greensand at\r\nRed Hill, in Surrey, and near Hurstpierpoint, in Sussex. There is no\r\nrailroad in the kingdom that, in the distance of fifty miles, exhibits\r\ngeological phenomena of greater variety or interest.\r\n\r\nIf the student will refer to _Wond._ p. 362, the stratification above\r\npointed out will be better comprehended. The sections visible on the\r\nturnpike road from London to Brighton are described, _Wond._ p. 363.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Balcombe station will afford some sections of\r\neasy access; and from Hayward s Heath station, Cuckfield is about two\r\nmiles distant. The quarries on the hill above that town were formerly\r\nvery productive, and the usual Wealden fossils may still be obtained;\r\nnamely, casts of several species of fresh-water shells (p. 416), scales\r\nand teeth of fishes (_Lepidotus_, p. 604), bones of reptiles, and\r\nvegetable remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChap. XXII.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF BRIGHTON CLIFFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Yes! where the huntsman winds his matin horn,\r\n     And the couch’d hare beneath the covert trembles;\r\n    Where shepherds tend their flocks, and grows the corn;\r\n     Where Fashion on our gay Parade assembles--\r\n    Wild Horses, Deer, and Elephants have strayed,\r\n     Treading beneath their feet old Ocean’s races.\"\r\n\r\n  Horace Smith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 267. Brighton Cliffs, near Kemptown,\r\n\r\nFrom the Sea-shore, looking East, or towards Rottingdean.\r\n\r\n_a._--The Elephant-bed.\r\n\r\n_b._--An ancient Sea-beach, composed of shingle and boulders of granite, porphyry, &c.\r\n\r\n_c._--The Chalk which forms the base of the cliff.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA stroll from Kemptown along the sea-shore to Rottingdean is replete\r\nwith interest, for the strata of which the cliffs are composed clearly\r\ndemonstrate that in very remote periods great changes have taken place\r\nin the relative position of the sea and land along the Sussex coast.\r\n\r\nSome years since, the bare face of the Cliffs, from the entrance to\r\nthe esplanade of the Chain-pier at the Old Steyne, to Kemptown, was\r\ncompletely exposed, and presented a most interesting section of the\r\nstrata. But at the present time, as every one knows, no portion of the\r\ncliffs is visible west of the _groin_ below Kemptown and the sections\r\nin my first work (_Foss. South D._ pl. iv. and v.) are the only\r\nrecords of the appearances formerly presented, and now concealed by\r\nthe sea-wall. Even the cliffs immediately beyond Kemptown are rapidly\r\ndiminishing from the action of the waves, which dash with greater\r\nviolence against their base in consequence of the means taken to\r\nprotect the adjoining terraces from the encroachments of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Cliffs east of Kemptown is shown in the sketch,\r\n_Lign. 267_. But further along the shore, towards Rottingdean, in\r\na ravine excavated by the encroachments of the sea, the ancient\r\nchalk-cliff behind the mass of strata seen above is exposed; this is\r\nrepresented in _Lign. 268_. A description of the appearances at this\r\npoint will elucidate the nature of the strata of which these cliffs are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the shore at low-water, masses of chalk, covered with\r\nfuci (_sea-weed_), &c. are seen protruding through the sands; and\r\ntowards the base of the cliff a bed of sea-beach is spread upon the\r\nsand; a low wall or terrace of white chalk constitutes the boundary\r\nof this shingle, as seen in _Lign. 267, c_. Thus we perceive, that\r\nthe present shore is formed by the continuation of the chalk strata of\r\nthe neighbouring Downs, partially covered with sand and beach, which\r\nare the detritus of the flints that have been washed out of previously\r\nexisting layers of chalk, and ground down by the action of the waves.\r\nNow, along the eastern part of the coast, towards Rottingdean and\r\nNewhaven, the chalk rises into mural precipices immediately from the\r\nsea-shore; but at this place the cliffs are composed of very different\r\nmaterials.[789]\r\n\r\n[789] _Wond._ p. 113; and _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._ vol. vii. pp.\r\n365, 396.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, there is, lying immediately on the terrace of\r\nchalk that forms the boundary-wall of the base of the cliff (_Lign.\r\n267, c_, and _Lign. 268, c c_,), a bed of sand (denoted by the\r\nletter _o, Lign. 268_), of irregular thickness and variable extent:\r\nfrom this sand marine shells and the jaw of a Whale (see p. 778), have\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 268. Cliffs between Kemptown and Rottingdean: seen\r\nfrom the West.\r\n\r\n   _a._--Elephant-bed; calcareous strata, containing teeth and bones of Elephants.\r\n   _b._--Ancient Shingle, or sea-beach.\r\n   _o._--Red of Sand; containing bones of Whales, and marine shells.\r\n_c, c._--Strata of undisturbed Chalk, dipping towards the Downs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. Upon the sand is a bed of loose shingle--a regular sea-beach\r\nappearing in no respect different, to the common observer, from that\r\nforming at the foot of the cliffs at the present moment; this bed is\r\nmarked _b_, in _Lign._ 267, and 268. Upon examining this shingle, it\r\nis found to contain numerous pebbles and boulders of granite, porphyry,\r\nsyenite, and other plutonic rocks (see p. 34), none of which occur in\r\nthe present beach. And in this ancient shingle, teeth and bones of\r\nextinct species of Elephant, Horse, and Deer have been discovered.\r\nWe have here, then, unquestionable evidence that this beach has been\r\nformed under conditions altogether different from those which now\r\nprevail; for not only is this shingle-bed elevated above the present\r\nsea-level, but its contents are of such a nature as could not have been\r\nthrown up by the sea, in its present relation to the countries that\r\nform its shores.\r\n\r\n3. A series of loosely aggregated calcareous deposits, obscurely\r\nstratified, rests upon this bed of shingle, and forms the upper portion\r\nof the cliff, varying in total thickness from fifty to one hundred\r\nand twenty feet. These strata are composed of chalk rubble and loam,\r\nwith flints partially water-worn, and boulders and pebbles of tertiary\r\nsandstone; the whole promiscuously intermingled, and deposited in\r\nnearly horizontal layers, from one to three or four feet thick. But\r\nthe face of the cliff generally presents a weather-worn and crumbling\r\naspect, and large masses are constantly falling down, in consequence\r\nof the removal of the ancient shingle, by the effects of the waves\r\nat the spring-tides. From the loose state of aggregation of these\r\nbeds, the fallen masses are speedily washed away, but here and there\r\nblocks of great hardness, provincially termed _Coombe-rock_, remain\r\nupon the shore; and, but a few years since, there was a group of high\r\nrocks of this kind near the Chain-pier. This compact conglomerate has\r\nbeen produced simply by an infiltration of calcareous spar, which has\r\ncemented together the fragments of chalk, flint, &c. In some places,\r\nthis infiltration has reached the bed of ancient shingle below, and\r\nlarge blocks are occasionally found, consisting of pebbles of flint,\r\ngranite, &c. held together by veins of calc-spar, in acicular or\r\nneedle-like crystals. In these sparry conglomerates, the teeth and\r\nbones of the mammalia previously noticed are sometimes found.[790]\r\n\r\n[790] My daughter discovered part of the lower jaw of a Deer, with\r\nteeth, imbedded in this conglomerate, in a mass on the shore near\r\nRottingdean.\r\n\r\nIt is in this accumulation of calcareous strata that numerous bones and\r\nteeth of the Mammoth, or fossil Elephant, have been discovered; I have\r\ntherefore designated it, the Elephant-bed, to distinguish it from other\r\nloose calcareous deposits.\r\n\r\nAs seen immediately beyond Kemptown (_Lign. 267_), the cliffs appear to\r\nbe entirely composed of the materials above described; but farther on,\r\nthe face of the ancient chalk-cliff is exposed (see _Lign. 268_); and\r\nif we extend our walk to Rottingdean, we find in many places the Chalk\r\nalone forming the present cliff; the Elephant-bed and its associated\r\nshingle and sand having been swept away. A like destruction awaits the\r\nremainder of these interesting deposits at no very distant period.[791]\r\n\r\n[791] See _Foss. South D._ p. 277, pl. iv.; and _Geol. S. E._ p. 30;\r\n_Wond._ p. 113.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting specimens of the Elephant-bed, both of the friable\r\nvarieties, and of the coombe-rock, and a few of the pebbles of granite,\r\nporphyry, &c. from the ancient beach, and also some of the sand beneath\r\nthe shingle, to examine microscopically on our return home, let us\r\nsit down on this mass of fallen chalk, and consider the nature of\r\nthose changes in the relative position of the land and sea, which the\r\nphenomena before us appear to indicate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that these cliffs are composed of the following\r\ndeposits:--1. The Elephant-bed (_Lign._ 267 and 268, _a_); a series of\r\ncalcareous strata, with bones and teeth of Elephants, Horses, Deer,\r\nand Oxen. 2. An ancient sea-beach (_b_), with pebbles and boulders of\r\nplutonic rocks, and bones of mammalia; and a bed of sand beneath,\r\nin which cetacea and mollusca (apparently of existing species) have\r\nbeen found. 3. Lastly, the regular Chalk-strata (_Lign. 268, c, c_),\r\nextending far out to sea.\r\n\r\nThese appearances demonstrate the following sequence of physical\r\nchanges, namely--\r\n\r\n1stly. The Chalk terrace (_c, c_), on which the ancient shingle-bed\r\n(_b_) rests, was on a level with the sea for a long period; for this\r\nbeach must have been formed, like the modern, by the action of the\r\nwaves on the then existing chalk cliffs (see _Lign. 268, Chalk_).\r\nBut there must have been some cause in operation, by which pebbles and\r\nboulders of granite, porphyry, and other rocks, foreign to our shores,\r\nand bones of Elephants, &c. were thrown up on the strand, and imbedded\r\nin the beach then in the progress of formation. These transported\r\nmaterials may have been floated to the Sussex coast by icebergs; an\r\nagency by which the delicate bones and teeth might be deposited without\r\ninjury, although surrounded by the water-worn detritus (see p. 43).\r\n\r\n2dly. The whole line of coast, with the ancient shingle, must have\r\nsubsided to such a depth, as to have allowed of the deposition of the\r\ncalcareous strata, forming the Elephant-bed. And from the absence of\r\ngravel and beach, and the circumstance of the chalk-rubble, of which\r\nthey are largely composed, often presenting angular fragments, it would\r\nappear that this deposition took place in some tranquil bay or inland\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nLastly. The land was elevated to its present level; and at this period\r\nthe formation of the existing sea-beach and line of cliffs commenced.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not conclude, from our remarks being restricted to the\r\ncliffs before us, that the phenomena here contemplated were limited to\r\nthis district; on the contrary, if our space would permit, it might be\r\nshown that they are referable to extensive geological changes, which\r\ntook place in the period immediately antecedent to the present. In all\r\nthe valleys of the South-east and East of England that open into the\r\nsea, traces, more or less extensive and important, of similar deposits\r\nexist. The level plain, called the _Steyne_, at Brighton, is entirely\r\nformed of the Elephant-bed, which extends up the valley to Preston and\r\nPatcham; in the latter place bones and teeth of Elephants have been\r\nfound. At Southbourn, the plain at the foot of the Chalk hills, called\r\n\"_The Wish_,\" containing remains of the Elephant, Rhinoceros, and\r\nHippopotamus, evidently belongs to the same epoch. At Folkstone, Mr. H.\r\nCarr has discovered large blocks of _Coombe-rock_, and Mr. S. J. Mackie\r\nabundance of bones; and at Dover, above the Chalk, similar masses\r\noccur. On the opposite coast of Franco there are also indications\r\nof these deposits. All these phenomena are no doubt connected with\r\nthe occurrence of immense quantities of mammalian remains in the\r\nsuperficial loam, &c. on the eastern coasts of England, and are\r\nreferable to the same geological epoch.\r\n\r\nImbedded in the Chalk, which is exposed at low water along the\r\nshore, very large Ammonites may sometimes be found between Kemptown\r\nand Rottingdean; and numerous examples of fossil sponges and other\r\namorphozoa (p. 219).\r\n\r\nThe teeth and bones of mammalia are rare in these cliffs, and it is\r\nnot probable that any will be obtained in a first visit; but from the\r\nfishermen and boys seen strolling along the shore, specimens may often\r\nbe purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL NOTES OF VARIOUS PLACES ON THE LINE OF THE GREAT WESTERN\r\nRAILROAD, FROM LONDON TO CLIFTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat splendid railway, the Great Western, by which the geologist may\r\nbe transported in five or six hours from the Tertiary strata of the\r\nmetropolis to the magnificent cliffs of Mountain limestone at Clifton,\r\nexposes in its course several fine sections, and passes within a\r\nmoderate distance of some interesting localities of organic remains.\r\n\r\nThis railroad traverses the _Tertiary_ strata by Ealing, Hanwell, and\r\nSlough, entering the _Chalk_ near Maidenhead, and pursuing rather a\r\ncircuitous route to Wallingford, beyond which station it passes over\r\nthe _Oolite_, and displays some bold sections of the limestones and\r\nclays of that formation. Near Bath it emerges on the Lias, and crossing\r\na narrow belt of the _New Red_, passes on to the _Carboniferous_ strata\r\nof the Bristol coal measures.[792] In this route, there are four\r\nplaces particularly deserving a visit from the geological student, and\r\ncollector of organic remains, namely, Farringdon, Swindon, Caine, and\r\nChippenham.\r\n\r\n[792] See Geological Map of England.\r\n\r\nVisit to Farringdon.--The railway station is reached in from two to\r\ntwo and a half hours from London; and an omnibus meets the morning and\r\nevening trains, to convey passengers to the town of Farringdon, which\r\nis about five miles distant.[793] There are two Inns in the town, the\r\nCrown and the Bell, where comfortable accommodation may be obtained.\r\n\r\n[793] As there is not a conveyance from Farringdon to meet every train\r\nthat stops at the station, the visitor who objects to a long walk\r\nshould previously ascertain the time when the omnibus or coach does\r\narrive, and select a train accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe town is situated in a valley, between Farringdon Hill, an eminence\r\nseen from a considerable distance in the approach from Oxford, and\r\nBadbury Hill (see _Lign. 269_). A small stream divides the town into\r\ntwo tithings, called Port and West-port, and flows into the Thames on\r\nthe north. The summits of the highest eminences near Farringdon consist\r\nof beds of sand and gravel, resting on Coral Bag and Kimmeridge Clay,\r\nand belonging to the Cretaceous formation, being the littoral deposits\r\nin this area of some sea of that period. The Lower Green or Shanklin\r\nSand, the Galt, Chalk-marl, and Chalk successively appear in the valley\r\nbelow Coxwell Furze up to the White Horse Downs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO FARRINGDON.]\r\n\r\nI have not observed any organic remains in the strata on the top of\r\nFarringdon and Badbury Hills, but from the pits in the low country\r\nnumerous fossil sponges and other _amorphozoa_ (see pp. 227-229)\r\nmaybe obtained. One of the most productive \"gravel-pits,\" as they\r\nare here termed, is situated on the road to Little Coxwell, about\r\nthree quarters of a mile from Farringdon. It lies on the left of the\r\nroad leading to the pretty village of Shrivenham. In this pit, the\r\nstrata consist of a coarse aggregate of siliceous particles, with some\r\nlenticular masses in the state of compact conglomerate; the lower\r\nbeds are of a whitish grey, the upper of a deep ferruginous colour.\r\nThe Windmill public-house, close by, is kept by the owner of the pit\r\n(Panting), and specimens of the \"petrified salt-cellars\" (see p. 228)\r\nand other sponges may generally be obtained of the inmates; but the\r\ncollector, in a few hours, will be able to gather an extensive and\r\ninteresting collection; the pick-hammer, _Lign. 266, fig. 2_, will\r\nbe found the most convenient instrument. There are two other pits\r\nwithin a moderate distance of Panting s pit, which are also rich in\r\nfossils. The principal organic remains to be obtained from these\r\nbeds are the zoophytes figured p. 227, and _Wond._ p. 637. The reader\r\nshould recollect that the beautiful cup-shaped sponge, _Chenendopora\r\nfungiformis_ (_Lign. 71_), is the \"petrified salt-cellar\" of the\r\nquarry-men. As many specimens as possible of the interesting coral,\r\n_Verticellipora_ (p. 227, _Lign. 70, fig. 4_,) should be procured,\r\nto examine the internal structure at leisure. The cup-shaped sponges\r\nshould be collected uncleared, for they are often full of minute\r\ncorals, shells, echinital spines, &c. There are also numerous specimens\r\nto be met with of _Terebratulæ_, _Ostreæ_, _Nautili_, and other shells;\r\nalso rolled _Belemnites_ from the Oolite, and bones of _Plesiosauri_\r\nand _Ichthyosauri_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 269. Section of the strata at Farringdon, Berks;\r\nfrom Farringdon Hill to the Chalk Downs on the South.\r\n\r\nThe summits of Farringdon and Bradbury Hills, and Coxwell Furze, are\r\nformed of sands and gravels of the Cretaceous period. The lines on the\r\nCoralline Oolite are not intended to denote the dip of the strata.\r\n\r\nNote:--See Memoirs on the Farringdon Sands, by Mr. R. A. C. Austen, in\r\n_Quart. Geol. Journ._ vol. vi. and by Mr. D. Sharpe, _ibid._ vol. x.]\r\n\r\nFossils of the Coralline Oolite.--At a short distance from the town\r\nthere is a large quarry of Coral-rag, called Lamb-close-pit, from which\r\n_Cidarites_ (p. 316) and spines, and several species of corals and\r\nshells may be procured. Occasionally Ammonites and Belemnites are met\r\nwith in the limestone at this place.\r\n\r\n_Stanford pit_, about three miles south-east of Farringdon, is well\r\nworthy of a visit; it consists of the following strata:--\r\n\r\n1. Uppermost; _Coral-rag_, three and a half feet.\r\n\r\n2. Limestone, containing an abundance of shells, particularly\r\nof Trigoniæ (p. 412), &c. four and a\r\nhalf feet.\r\n\r\n3. Portland sand, of an olive-green colour, three feet.\r\n\r\n4. Kimmeridge clay.\r\n\r\nSome shells are extremely numerous; principally of the genera\r\n_Trigonia_, _Gervillia_, _Pecten_, _Ostrea_, _Terebratula_, &c.; fine\r\n_Belemnites_ also occur. The oolitic structure is very apparent in the\r\nupper beds of limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwindon, Wilts.--Fourteen miles beyond the Farringdon station of the\r\nrailway, we arrive at that of Swindon. About a mile from this station,\r\non the rising ground to the south, stands the little, and formerly\r\nretired, town of Swindon. Here, when a schoolboy, my curiosity was\r\nstrongly excited by the so-called petrified \"_ram’s horns_,\" and\r\n\"_oak_,\" so abundant in the solid masses of stone in the neighbouring\r\nquarries, and which daily came under my notice in my rambles around\r\nthe town. It is indeed a locality most prolific in the Ammonites and\r\nother shells, and in the fossil wood peculiar to the upper division of\r\nthe Oolite formation--the Portland beds; the hill on which the town\r\nis built consisting of those strata; the Kimmeridge Clay, on which\r\nthey rest, is exposed in the railway cuttings in the valley on the\r\nnorth. There are two little Inns, the Bell and the Goddard Arms, where\r\nthe visitor may meet with accommodation. The quarries, which are in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the town, abound in Ammonites, Trigoniæ,\r\nand other shells: and some layers are entirely composed of the casts\r\nof several species. The Ammonites are principally of two kinds, viz.\r\n_A. biplex_ and _A. triplicatus_, and vary in size from a few inches\r\nto upwards of three feet in diameter; the specimens are casts only,\r\nno vestiges of the shells remaining. At Aylesbury the same species\r\noccur in clay, with the shells entire (see p. 481). A large collection\r\nmay be made in a few hours; and from some of the quarry-men the less\r\ncommon forms may probably be obtained. Casts of the bivalves called\r\n_Gervillia_ and _Perna_ abound in the quarry on the right hand of the\r\nroad. I have collected from this place, in addition to those above\r\nmentioned, casts of the genera _Buccinum_, _Cardium_, _Cytherea_\r\nor _Venus_, _Nerita_, _Terebra_, _Pullastra_, _Pecten_; and of the\r\nlarge species of _Pleurotomaria_ which occurs in the Kimmeridge\r\nclay of Hartwell, with the shell perfect (p. 428); also vertebræ of\r\n_Ichthyosauri_.\r\n\r\nA section of the strata from Swindon to the nearest point of the chalk\r\nhills would pass over, in succession,--1. Portland Oolite; 2. Lower\r\nGreensand; 3. Galt; 4. Upper Greensand; 5. Chalk-marl; and, 6. Chalk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO CHIPPENHAM AND CALNE.]\r\n\r\nChippenham and Calne.--In from three and a half to four hours the\r\ntraveller from London reaches the town of Chippenham, ninety-three\r\nmiles from London, and situated on the Oxford clay; the locality\r\nwhere Mr. William Bye obtained those interesting specimens of\r\n_Belemnoteuthis_, that contain vestiges of the soft bodies and arms\r\n(see page 459, and _Lign. 145_).\r\n\r\nCalne, about six miles from Chippenham, stands on Oolitic limestone;\r\nand the quarries around the town have long been celebrated for the\r\nperfection and abundance of their fossil remains; particularly of\r\nvarious species of the turban echinites (_Cidarites_, see p. 316), and\r\ntheir spines. A day or two at each of these towns will be well spent by\r\nthe geologist and the collector of organic remains.\r\n\r\nBath and Bristol.--The immediate vicinities of these cities are rich in\r\ninteresting localities for the geologist. A visit to the public museums\r\nin Bath and Bristol cannot fail to gratify the student, and will at\r\nonce point out to him the places most worthy his examination. That of\r\nBristol is admirably arranged, and contains, among other treasures,\r\nthe specimen of fossil _Squaloraia_ (see p. 596); the remains of the\r\nreptiles of the magnesian conglomerate, the _Thecodontosaurus_ (p.\r\n713); and the celebrated collection of Crinoidea (p. 283) formed by the\r\nlate Mr. Miller.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO CLIFTON.]\r\n\r\nClifton.--The stupendous rocks of mountain limestone which flank both\r\nsides of the Avon in its course from Clifton to the Severn are too well\r\nknown to render a general description necessary, and our limits will\r\nnot admit of details. The geological student should first obtain a\r\n_coup d’œil_ of the appearance and position of the strata, by sailing\r\ndown to the embouchure of the river in a steam-packet, and afterwards\r\nvisit on foot the most interesting localities. On the right bank of\r\nthe river, near the \"Black Rock,\" the teeth of several kinds of fishes\r\nof the genera _Psammodus_ (p. 587), _Hybodus_ (p. 591), _Ceratodus_\r\n(p. 587), &c. may be obtained, and shells and corals of the mountain\r\nlimestone. Polished specimens of the coralline marbles may be purchased\r\nat the shops.\r\n\r\n_Portishead_, a pretty little village on the south-east bank of the\r\nSevern, is well worth a visit; and, by going in the morning steamer\r\nand returning in the evening, several hours may be agreeably spent\r\nalong the shore below the hotel; and fossil plants and shells, from the\r\nblocks of millstone grit, and numerous rock specimens may be collected.\r\n\r\nA sail to _Chepstow_, and up the Wye as far as Tintern Abbey, returning\r\non foot, or in a carriage, by Piercefield to Chepstow, is an excursion\r\nreplete with the highest interest and enjoyment. The picturesque\r\nbeauties of the Wye are dependent, like those of Clifton and Matlock,\r\non the disruptions which the strata of mountain limestone have\r\nsustained. The magnificent scenery as we pass up the river, and the\r\ninteresting associations connected with the ruins of Tintern Abbey,\r\ncannot fail to delight the traveller; but the enchanting scene that\r\nbursts upon the sight from the heights of Piercefield is magnificent\r\nin the extreme, and equal to the grandest views on the Rhine. Looking\r\ndown from those elevated pinnacles of rock, which are covered with the\r\nmost luxuriant vegetation, and crested with forests of pine, oak, and\r\nbeech, we perceive the Wye pursuing its tortuous course at our feet,\r\nand winding along, around promontories of limestone, towards Chepstow;\r\nwhile immediately beyond, and apparently separated from the opposite\r\nbank of the river only by a precipitous rampart or mountain limestone,\r\nthe Severn appears as a vast inland sea, bounded in the remote distance\r\nby the country around Gloucester, and extending on the right to the\r\nBristol Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other interesting geological sites within a few miles of Clifton\r\nand Bristol, may be mentioned--\r\n\r\n1. Aust Cliff; a section of the Lias, from which many interesting\r\nfossils have been procured.\r\n\r\n2. Banwell Cave; which is particularly deserving of examination (see p.\r\n809).\r\n\r\n3. Cheddar Cliffs; which are equally interesting to the geologist\r\nand to the lover of picturesque scenery. They are about twenty miles\r\nfrom Bristol; and a carriage and pair will be required, if the visitor\r\nintends to return the same day. The best arrangement is to visit the\r\ncavern at Banwell, remain in the neighbouring town the following night,\r\nand make an excursion to Cheddar Cliffs the next day.\r\n\r\nThere has lately been opened at Cheddar a cavern which surpasses in the\r\nbeauty of its stalactites any hitherto discovered in England. The Rev.\r\nW. D. Conybeare states, that it is the only one that at all realizes\r\nany idea we have of the far-famed _Grotto of Antiparos_. It consists of\r\none grand arch, or porch, and three or four lateral branches and narrow\r\nfissures, about ten or twelve feet broad, and from thirty to forty feet\r\nhigh, vested and draped with the most fantastic hangings of stalactite.\r\nThe floor is a mass of stalagmite, covering a bed of gravel of the\r\nmountain limestone, which fills up about ten feet of the bottom. I am\r\nnot aware that any fossil bones have been observed.\r\n\r\nWhen visiting Banwell, inquiry should be made if there be any Cave at\r\nHutton accessible to the visitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above remarks must be regarded only as suggestions; for it would\r\nrequire a volume to particularize the geological objects of interest\r\nwithin a short distance of Bristol. The coal-mines in the neighbourhood\r\nof Bath and Bristol should be visited, and fossil plants collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL EXCURSION TO MATLOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ------ \"In famed Attica such lovely dales\r\n    Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempè boast\r\n    A charm they know not.\"\r\n\r\n                                            Lord Byron.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and romantic Dale of Matlock, although one hundred and\r\nforty-two miles distant, is now brought within nine hours of the\r\nmetropolis. Leaving London from the Euston-square station of the\r\nBirmingham Railway, at eleven o’clock (taking the precaution to have a\r\nticket that will ensure a passage from Rugby by the _Midland_ Counties\r\nRailroad to Derby), we pass over in succession the clays, sands,\r\nand beds of gravel, composing the _Tertiary_ strata of the London\r\nbasin; and at Watford, steep cuttings of these deposits are seen on\r\neach side of the station. A long tunnel through the _White Chalk_ of\r\nHertfordshire is then passed; and at Tring we arrive at the termination\r\nof the Chalk, and obtain a fine view of the north-west escarpment of\r\nthe Downs, which is seen extending on the right towards Ivinghoe, and\r\nattaining an elevation of 900 feet. The railway then proceeds over the\r\nChalk-marl, Galt, and Lower Greensand, to near Leighton, where these\r\nmembers of the Cretaceous system are succeeded by the _Oolite_ of\r\nBuckinghamshire and Northamptonshire; and the line crosses the Grand\r\nJunction Canal near the emergence of the _Lias_; the Rugby station\r\nbeing situated in the midst of that formation. We then enter the\r\nMidland Counties line, and pass on to Stoney Stanton, where the Lias\r\nterminates, and the _Triassic_ or _New Red_ strata appear; proceeding\r\ntowards Leicester, clays and marls of a dull red colour, denoting the\r\nTriassic deposits, constitute the slopes on each side the railway. As\r\nwe approach Leicester, the craggy summits of Charnwood Forest appear in\r\nthe distance On the left, with here and there an isolated conical hill,\r\nindicating the protruded masses of granite, porphyry, and syenite,\r\nwhich belong to the group of plutonic rocks of the central county of\r\nEngland. The granitic mass of Mount Sorel is seen along the railway\r\nfrom Sileby to Barrow, Charnwood Forest appearing in the distance.\r\n\r\nLeaving Leicester for Derby, the route continues along Triassic strata;\r\nand a good section of the variegated marls, with veins of white fibrous\r\ngypsum, may be observed at _Red Hill_, where a short tunnel perforates\r\na ridge of the same deposits. The railroad then emerges on the verdant\r\nalluvial plain through which the Trent, its waters increased by the\r\nconfluence of the Dove and the Soar, pursues its course towards the\r\nnorth, and joins the Humber at Alkborough, whence the united streams\r\nflow on, and empty themselves into the German Ocean.\r\n\r\nAt Derby, where the train arrives at half-past five, half an hour is\r\nallowed for dinner; and we then proceed by the _North Midland_ line, by\r\nDuffield and Helper, through a beautiful valley watered by the Derwent,\r\nwhich is seen winding its way towards Derby. The high grounds skirting\r\nthis valley are composed of the millstone-grit and sandstone of the\r\nCarboniferous system (see p. 31). Ten miles beyond Derby, we arrive\r\nat Amber Gate station, where an omnibus and other conveyances are in\r\nwaiting, to convey passengers to Cromford and Matlock.[794]\r\n\r\n[794] As it frequently happens that more passengers are brought by\r\nthe train, than the omnibus or coach can convey, some activity is\r\nnecessary to secure an outside place, which it is most desirable for\r\nthe s geological tourist to possess, that he may command a good view of\r\nthe splendid scenery, which will be constantly opening on his sight,\r\nthrough the romantic pass that leads to Matlock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO MATLOCK DALE.]\r\n\r\nThe road from Amber Gate leads through a succession of picturesque\r\nscenes of surpassing beauty. At Whatstandwell-bridge[795] (see _Lign.\r\n273_), over which the Derwent is crossed, the view is most imposing.\r\nThe river is seen rapidly pursuing its course between richly wooded\r\nravines, fringed with luxuriant foliage to the water’s edge.[796] As we\r\nadvance, the bold mountain ridge of _Crich Hill_ appears on the light,\r\nwith the village of Holloway at a considerable elevation, and Lea\r\nMills near the base of the range; while on the left are the hills and\r\noverhanging woods of Alderwasley. Ascending to the Inn at Cromford, the\r\nroad turns suddenly to the right, and by an opening cut through a mass\r\nof strata twenty feet thick, called _Scarthing Rock_, conducts to the\r\nsouthern entrance of Matlock Dale. On passing this chasm, the glorious\r\nfeatures of this enchanting region burst on the view. On the east is a\r\nrange of limestone cliffs, richly wooded, with Willersley Castle, the\r\nseat of the Arkwrights, embosomed in trees on a commanding eminence;\r\nand on the west, a rocky precipice, crested with forests, and its sides\r\npartially covered with copses and brushwood; while the river, dashing\r\nthrough the ravine on the right, completes the magic of the picture--\r\n\r\n    \"So wond’rous wild, the whole might seem.\r\n     The scenery of a fairy dream.\"\r\n\r\n                                          Lady of the Lake.\r\n\r\n[795] Hotstandwell in the guide-books; _Whatstandwell_ in the Ordnance\r\nMap.\r\n\r\n[796] The pedestrian should alight at the little Inn at Whatstandwell,\r\nand walk on to Matlock the following morning.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of about half a mile, we pass the toll-gate, and a bold\r\nmural precipice of mountain limestone suddenly appears on the eastern\r\nbank of the river; while on the western, a steep slope, clothed with\r\nverdure, rises rapidly to the lofty pine-clad eminence called Masson\r\nHill, an elevation of upwards of 1,000 feet. The base of this mountain\r\nstretches directly across the dale in front, and apparently presents a\r\nbarrier to an egress from the valley on the north; but as we advance,\r\nthe road is seen to wind round its foot by a defile along the left\r\nbank of the river; and the magnificent rock called the High Tor rises\r\nin majestic grandeur on the right. The valley now gradually expands,\r\nand, at the distance of about two and a half miles from the entrance\r\nat Scarthing’s rock, terminates in the champaign country beyond\r\nMatlock village.[797] From the precipitous nature of the escarpment of\r\nmountain limestone which forms the eastern boundary of the dale, the\r\nbuildings at Matlock Bath are confined to the left or western side of\r\nthe Derwent, and are scattered here and there among the trees, on the\r\nprojecting plots and terraces formed by the fallen cliffs of sandstone,\r\nwhich, during the lapse of ages, have become partially disintegrated\r\nand are more or less concealed by vegetable soil; the projecting rocks\r\nare covered with lichens, mosses, and ferns.\r\n\r\n[797] The proper name of the hamlet in the valley, generally called\r\nMatlock, is _Matlock Bath_.\r\n\r\nThe hotels, of which there are several, are all delightfully situated;\r\nbut the _Temple Hotel_, which stands on a terrace on the side of Masson\r\nHill, about a hundred feet above the river, has the preference in my\r\nestimation; its elevated situation, its seclusion from the noise and\r\nbustle of the village, and its bowers and hedge-rows of sweet-briar and\r\nroses, imparting a character of sylvan beauty to the spot, peculiarly\r\ngrateful to the traveller who wishes to enjoy a quiet sojourn at\r\nMatlock Dale. The local guide-books afford the necessary information\r\nto direct the visitor to the celebrated picturesque spots of this\r\nbeautiful region; our immediate object is to point out the most\r\nimportant geological phenomena.[798]\r\n\r\n[798] The book entitled \"The Gem of the Peak,\" by W. Adams, price Is.,\r\nand the \"_Brief Remarks on the Geology and Botany of Derbyshire_,\" by\r\nthe same author, price 1_s._, will be found to contain much valuable\r\ninformation. The \"_Derbyshire Tourist’s Guide_,\" with plates, 8vo., by\r\nE. Rhodes, price 6_s._, is a delightful hand-book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LONDON TO MATLOCK.]\r\n\r\nGeological Position of Matlock Dale.--That the reader may clearly\r\ncomprehend the geological character of the romantic district in which\r\nhe is now situated, we will briefly enumerate the several formations\r\nover which we passed, in our rapid transit from London; by the aid\r\nof the geological map, the following description will be easily\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nOur route from the metropolis commenced from the centre of the\r\n_Tertiary_ strata, upon which London is situated, and which fills\r\nup an extensive depression or basin in the Chalk; we then passed\r\nover, or rather (by the tunnel) through the north-west boundary of\r\nthe _Chalk_ basin, and successively came upon the _Portland_ stone\r\nand other beds of the _Oolite_, and the _Lias_; the strata of these\r\nformations successively rising from beneath each other as we proceeded.\r\nIn Leicestershire, the beds of the _New Red_ or _Triassic_ formation\r\nemerged from under the Lias; and at the Trent Junction the nature of\r\nthe deposits was concealed by the alluvial plains of the river. Beyond\r\nDerby, we entered upon strata of the _Carboniferous_ system, the\r\n_Millstone grits_ and _sandstones_, and finally reached the Mountain\r\nlimestone and its associated _Magnesian limestones_, which compose the\r\nmountainous district of Derbyshire. The following diagram will serve to\r\nillustrate this description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of Matlock is, therefore, a region of\r\nCarboniferous limestone and millstone strata, which, as we have\r\npreviously explained (see p. 31), are of marine origin; and those beds\r\nthat contain organic remains abound in extinct species of shells and\r\ncrinoidea. These rocks are also the grand depository of the ores of\r\nlead (see _Wond._ p. 681), calamine, &c., and contain a variety of\r\nminerals of great beauty and interest. This district has also been the\r\ntheatre, in very remote periods, of great physical changes, and the\r\nstrata have been upheaved and displaced by volcanic action, the solid\r\nrocks rent asunder, and beds of mineral substances, rendered fluid\r\nby intense heat, have been injected between the layers, and into the\r\nfissures of the sedimentary strata; to these revolutions, the present\r\nbold and picturesque features of the country are attributable. Here\r\nthen are phenomena replete with the highest interest; the very beds\r\nof lava may still be seen--the rents and fissures caused by their\r\nexplosive action, and now lined with rich metallic ores and spars, may\r\nbe examined--and the thermal waters, rising in perpetual fountains from\r\nan incalculable depth, testify that the internal fires, the sources of\r\nthese catastrophes, though latent, are not extinguished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MATLOCK INCRUSTING SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nA Walk to the Incrusting Springs.--The so-called \"petrifying springs\r\nand wells\" of Derbyshire are celebrated throughout England for the\r\nincrusted birds’ nests, baskets, &c. which are very generally purchased\r\nby visitors, as mementos of a trip into this county. The nature of this\r\ndeposition of calcareous matter has already been explained (see p.\r\n39; and _Wond._ p. 75); and, although the objects above mentioned are\r\nscarcely worthy of notice, the natural operations by which the tufa and\r\ntravertine are produced, are extremely interesting.[799]\r\n\r\n[799] If the proprietors of these springs could be induced to follow\r\nthe example of the Italians at San Filippo (see _Wond._ p. 75), or\r\nof the French, in Auvergne, or the Germans at Carlsbad, elegant\r\nbas-reliefs and other beautiful objects might be obtained, for the\r\nincrusting power of the Matlock waters is very considerable.\r\n\r\nOur first stroll shall therefore be to the beds of tufa which have been\r\nformed in remote ages by this operation and which now constitute the\r\nterrace on which the Old Bath and two other hotels, and the elegant\r\nmodern Church are situated. Proceeding from our Inn, the tufaceous rock\r\nmay be seen protruding in masses on the right hand, in front of the\r\nbeautiful parterres of the hotels; and upon crossing the road, where\r\na narrow path leads down to the bed of the river, and nearly opposite\r\nto the new church, the lower beds of tufa are exposed in a quarry,\r\nfrom which large blocks of the coarse, porous stone are extracted for\r\ngrotto and rock-work. From this spot I collected very fine impressions\r\nof the foliage of the oak, elm, and hazel, leaves of adder’s tongue\r\n(_scolopendrium_), &c. and large portions of moss, beautifully\r\nincrusted.[800]\r\n\r\n[800] I could not obtain any specimens of this kind from the quarry-men\r\nnor from the shops or museums, as they are termed; such objects not\r\nbeing deemed \"curiosities\" by the good folks of Matlock; and the\r\nworkmen forbade me to search for more in the quarry!\r\n\r\nThe origin of this deposit of tufa, which covers so huge an area along\r\nthe western flank of the mountain range of Masson Hill, is attributable\r\nto the thermal springs having, at some very remote period, issued from\r\na much higher source than at present, and flowing down the side of the\r\nhill into the river at its foot, the water, as it cooled, deposited\r\nthe lime with which it was charged on the stems, branches, leaves, and\r\nother extraneous bodies. At this time the springs escape from crevices\r\nin the rocks at an elevation of about one hundred feet above the bed\r\nof the river; the waters, at their source, have a temperature of from\r\n66° to 68°, and contain free carbonic acid and minute quantities of\r\nmuriates and sulphates of magnesia, lime, and soda. Their origin is\r\nnow concealed, and the water conducted by pipes to the various baths\r\nand fountains; but wherever a rill escapes, and flows down the hill,\r\nthe moss, &c. is quickly incrusted. I was informed, that in about eight\r\nmouths a basket of eggs would be entirely enveloped in a thick mass\r\nof tufa. The uniform high temperature of these waters shows that they\r\nemanate from a very deep source; and it is probable that they originate\r\nfrom steam, which is cooled and condensed as it approaches the surface\r\nof the earth. The miners assured me, that the springs burst out from\r\nbeneath the volcanic rock, here termed _toadstone_, and that the water,\r\nwhen it first issues, is of a higher temperature than the Matlock Bath\r\nwater; but its heat is reduced by the cool land-springs with which it\r\nbecomes intermingled.\r\n\r\nMost waters that flow through limestone districts deposit travertine\r\nmore or less abundantly; and I observed several streams in my rambles\r\nin the neighbourhood of Matlock which appeared to possess this property\r\nin as great a degree as the thermal springs. There is a lovely\r\nwaterfall, which issues from the side of a mountain that flanks the\r\nroad leading by Via Gellia to Middleton Moor, at an elevation of two\r\nhundred feet, and flows into the adjacent valley, bounding and dancing\r\nfrom one mossy knoll to another, and appearing from the opposite hill\r\nlike a stream of molten silver, undulating through a carpet of emerald\r\ngreen. The waters of this cascade have formed a thick bed of travertine\r\nalong the side of the hill; and the stone is of so firm a texture, that\r\nthe walls of a cottage hard by are constructed of it.\r\n\r\nI gathered from the banks of this waterfall, bundles of moss and groups\r\nof small shells incrusted with a beautiful white tufa; and impressions\r\nof leaves, twigs, &c. were observable in the blocks of travertine\r\nrecently quarried.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the effects produced by these limpid streams, by which\r\nperishable leaves and fragile shells are preserved for ages in solid\r\nmasses of rock, we are reminded of the forcible and eloquent remarks\r\nof Sir Humphry Davy, when observing similar phenomena in the volcanic\r\nregions of Italy. \"How marvellous are those laws, by which even the\r\nhumblest types of organic existence are preserved though born amidst\r\nthe sources of their destruction; and by which a species of immortality\r\nis given to generations, floating, as it were, like evanescent bubbles\r\non a stream raised from the deepest caverns of the earth, and instantly\r\nlosing what may be called its spirit in the atmosphere!\"[801]\r\n\r\n[801] \"Consolations in Travel; or, the Last Days of a Philosopher;\" by\r\nSir Humphry Davy. See also _Wond._ p. 77.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAVERN OF THE HIGH TOR.]\r\n\r\nVisit to the Cavern of the High Tor.--After the visitor has taken\r\na general view of the romantic scenery around him, a visit to the\r\ncavern at the foot of the High Tor will enable him to comprehend the\r\nnature of those physical changes which have imparted to this district\r\nits picturesque character. Descending into the valley and passing\r\nnorthwards, through the only street in Matlock Bath, along the banks of\r\nthe Derwent, which are beautifully overshadowed by copses and forest\r\ntrees, the bold cliff of mountain limestone, called the High Tor, the\r\nmost imposing feature in the dale, suddenly appears on the right bank\r\nof the river. This rock rises to the height of four hundred feet; the\r\nupper half forming a bare and nearly perpendicular wall of limestone;\r\nthe lower portion being concealed by brushwood and luxuriant foliage to\r\nthe river s edge. At this spot, a rude wooden hand-rail is stretched\r\nacross the Derwent, which is here of considerable breadth, and dashes\r\nalong over fallen masses of rock in its course towards the south. The\r\nHigh Tor (_Lign. 270_) consists of a capping of Drift and of Millstone\r\ngrit (2); of a series of beds of limestone with encrinites and shells,\r\nslightly inclined southward (1); of a layer of volcanic matter, termed\r\nin Derbyshire _toadstone_, from its mottled yellow and greenish\r\nappearance (3); and of a bed of _Trap_, or _toadstone_ (_b_), at the\r\nbase, and near the floor at the entrance of the fissure or excavation\r\nin the limestone forming the cavern (_a_); which trap rock also appears\r\non the opposite bank of the river (_c_), beneath the highly inclined\r\nand dislocated masses of limestone, forming part of the base of Masson\r\nHill. The upper bed of _toadstone_ (3) cannot be seen, for the face of\r\nthe cliff (although represented bare for the sake of perspicuity in\r\nthe plan, _Lign. 270_) is entirely concealed, half-way up, by dense\r\nfoliage; but an intelligent miner assured me that such was the fact,\r\nand that, in sinking a shaft in the opposite hill, _toadstone_ was\r\nfound in a corresponding situation. Upon entering the cavern, which is\r\nnot of considerable extent, the first phenomenon to be observed is the\r\nbed of _toadstone_, which protrudes near the floor, beneath a stratum\r\nof limestone. The limestone in contact with the trap is in some places\r\nchanged to a light green colour, and has a slaty texture, from the\r\neffects of intense heat under great pressure; it is often permeated\r\nwith veins of pyrites, and white calcareous spar. The inner recesses\r\nof the cavern are literally covered, both on the floor and sides,\r\nwith very large rhomboidal crystals of carbonite of lime, of the form\r\ncommonly called _dog-tooth spar_; the cave surpasses, in this respect,\r\nevery other in Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _G. A. M. delt._ _J. Whimper, lignt._\r\n\r\nLign. 270.

Tine masses of blue fluor (provincially termed\r\n_blue John_) and double refracting calcareous spar were also obtained.\r\nOn the opposite bank of the Derwent, beneath the limestone, and\r\nextending along the road-side for two or three hundred yards, a bed of\r\n_toadstone_, evidently the continuation of that at the base of the High\r\nTor, is distinctly exposed.\r\n\r\nProceeding northwards, the line of mural precipices, of which the\r\nHigh Tor is the most elevated point, gradually descends; but there\r\nis a bold and bare rock, called the Church Tor, from the church of\r\nthe village of Matlock being situated near its summit, that requires\r\nparticular remark; for on the face of this cliff the strata present a\r\nseries of curves, or rather arches, nowhere broken, but having such\r\nan appearance as would result from an expansive force from beneath\r\nuplifting a group of horizontal strata, while yet in a soft or plastic\r\nstate. The upper beds of limestone at the Church Tor abound in marine\r\nshells (_Spirifer_, see p. 390, particularly the large species, _S.\r\ngiganteus_). Such are the appearances presented by the strata in this\r\nlocality, on the right bank of the Derwent. On the opposite side of\r\nthe valley are beds of limestone, many of them varying in mineral\r\nconstitution from those we have examined, being of a light yellowish\r\ndun or cream colour (hence called _Dun-stone_), and containing\r\nmagnesia; in these strata traces of fossil plants are occasionally\r\nfound. These magnesian limestones are of a granular texture and\r\nextremely hard; they are said to be very rich in lead and calamine,\r\nand have been extensively worked. The prevailing rocks on this (the\r\nwestern) side of the valley belong to this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATIONS OF DERBYSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nGeological Formations of Derbyshire.--Before we proceed on our walk,\r\nlet us sit down awhile on this mossy bank, beneath the magnificent\r\nknoll of trees that here overshadows the river, and, by a reference to\r\nthe geological table (p. 31) and the geological map, obtain a clear\r\nidea of the nature and succession of the strata around us; in other\r\nwords, the order of superposition of the deposits of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n1. _Lowermost._ A bed of compact Basalt or Trap (in Derbyshire\r\ncalled _Toadstone_), of uncertain thickness and extent. This rock\r\nconsists of mineral matter that has undergone complete fusion, and\r\nbeen erupted from the profound depths of some internal source of\r\nintense heat (see _Wond._ pp. 684, 848). The upheaving force thus\r\nput in action having been unequally exerted in different places, the\r\nsuperincumbent beds of limestone have been protruded in dome-shaped\r\nmasses through the upper strata; and are now seen bent and\r\ncurved, forming what is termed arched stratification.[802]\r\n\r\n[802] My excellent friend, the late Robert Bakewell, Esq., was the\r\nfirst geologist who correctly explained the phenomena here described.\r\nSee his Introduction to Geology, 5th edit. p. 147.\r\n\r\n_Vesicular_ or _amygdaloidal_ Toadstone. This partakes more of the\r\ncharacter of scoriæ, being full of little cells or cavities formed by air\r\nbubbles; when these cavities are filled with other mineral matter, as\r\nis often the case, the rock is termed amygdaloidal. This bed of Trap\r\nwas formerly considered to be distinct from the lowermost; but it is\r\nnow supposed, and with much probability, that all the masses of\r\nigneous rock that pierce, or are intercalated with, the sedimentary\r\nstrata, have sprung from one common source, and are but lateral\r\nprotrusions from some grand mass of erupted materials.[803]\r\n\r\n[803] See an analogous example, _Wond._ p. 857.\r\n\r\n2. Limestones with intervening layers of clay, and Magnesian\r\nlimestones, or Dunstones.\r\n\r\n3. Alternation of Limestone and Shale. Many of these limestones\r\nabound in organic remains; and it is in this group that the\r\nornamental marbles of Derbyshire are comprised. The upper beds\r\nare generally of a slaty texture, and contain layers and nodules of\r\nchert, which often afford exquisite siliceous casts of the stems of\r\n_Crinoidea_ (pulley-stones, see p. 284; and _Wond._ p. 650), and shells;\r\nwhite chert or porcelain-stone, and black jasper or flinty slate also\r\noccur in these beds.\r\n\r\n4. Millstone Grit and Shale, and coarse sandstones; these form\r\nthe subsoil of the principal heights of the mountain ranges, their\r\nsterile soil supporting only a covering of ling and heath.\r\n\r\n5. Coal Measures; consisting of beds of Coal, with intervening\r\nlayers of shale, clay, and ironstone (see p. 80).\r\n\r\n6. Permian and Triassic strata (see pp. 29, 30).\r\n\r\nThe mineral substances found in the above strata in Derbyshire are\r\nvery numerous, and the organic remains equally so, and of a highly\r\ninteresting character.[804]\r\n\r\n[804] A good, catalogue of the principal varieties will be found in Mr.\r\nAdams’s pamphlet previously recommended; and specimens may be obtained\r\nat his museum in Matlock, and from Mr. Tennant (Professor of Mineralogy\r\nto King’s College), 149, Strand, London.\r\n\r\nThis enumeration of the geological formations of which the country\r\naround Matlock is composed will enable us to proceed on our rambles\r\nwithout further digression, and should the reader be at a loss to\r\ncomprehend the nature of any of the rocks or strata we may meet with on\r\nour way, he can refer to the above description.\r\n\r\nMr. Bakewell, with his wonted penetration, first detected the true\r\ncharacter of the stratification of the High Tor, previous writers\r\nhaving described this cliff as being composed of nearly horizontal\r\nlayers. But this is a deceptive appearance; for, although, when viewed\r\nin front, or in the direction of their planes, the strata appear to be\r\nhorizontal, yet they are in reality highly inclined, as may be seen in\r\nthe line of dip, and enfold or envelope the back of the cliff; and\r\nthey are continued into the hill (Masson) on the opposite side of the\r\nvalley, where they present a similar arrangement. The continuity of\r\nthe strata is broken by the vale of the Derwent, which has evidently\r\noriginated in a fissure extending along the axis of elevation, in a\r\ndirection from north to south; thus forming the water channel for the\r\ndrainage of the country on the north, and the bed of the present river.\r\nWe have already pointed out the curved position of the strata on the\r\nface of the _Church Tor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO CRICH HILL.]\r\n\r\nExcursion to Crich Hill.--The appearances observable at the High Tor\r\nare of so striking a character, and involve the consideration of so\r\nmany interesting phenomena relating to the physical mutations which\r\nthis district has undergone, that it is desirable, while they are\r\nstrongly impressed upon the mind, to take an excursion to Crich, a few\r\nmiles to the south-east of Matlock. Here there is an entire mountain of\r\nlimestone, formed by a protrusion of numerous strata, many hundred feet\r\nin thickness, through the once superincumbent beds of millstone grit\r\nand sandstone, into a dome-shaped mass, upwards of 800 feet high. And\r\nthere it stands, a stupendous monument of one of the past revolutions\r\nof the globe, with its arches of rifted rock, supported by a central\r\nmound of erupted mineral matter, now cooled down into an amorphous mass\r\nof compact basalt! Were there no other object of interest near Matlock,\r\nCrich Hill would alone render it worthy of resort.\r\n\r\nFrom the heights above our hotel, looking towards the south-east,\r\na mountain remarkable for its elevation and obtusely conical\r\nconfiguration, and distinguished by a tower on the summit, forms a\r\nstriking object on the horizon, at an apparent distance of three or\r\nfour miles--this is Crich Hill; and on the same range, to the right, is\r\nseen the church-spire of Crich village (see _Lign. 272_).\r\n\r\nA long summer’s day is not too long to visit this mountain, and examine\r\nall its interesting details. A good pedestrian should proceed with\r\nhis hammer and haversack, for every step of the road is replete with\r\ninterest; and as numerous specimens will be obtained, bags, paper, and\r\nboxes should be taken. If an invalid or ladies be of the party, it will\r\nbe desirable to have a carriage for the day, and dine at the little\r\nvillage of Crich;[805] and, if time permit, the interesting ruins of\r\nSouth Wingfield Manor-House (once the prison of Mary of Scotland),\r\nabout two miles from Crich, may also be visited.\r\n\r\n[805] A good, guide will be a great acquisition, and save much, time\r\nand trouble; and Benjamin Froggatt, who has conducted Dr. Buckland and\r\nother geologists to the principal localities in the neighbourhood, will\r\nbe found an obliging and intelligent attendant, perfectly conversant\r\nwith the richest geological and botanical sites around Matlock.\r\n\r\nThe shortest drive from Matlock to Crich Hill is over Cromford-bridge;\r\nbut a far more picturesque route is by the Derby-road to\r\nWhatstandwell-bridge (see _Lign. 273_), and from thence ascending\r\nthe hill to Crich, and returning home by Holloway; making the entire\r\ndistance about twelve miles. As our immediate object is to examine\r\nthe geological features of the mountain, we shall proceed by the\r\nnearest road; and upon reaching Scarthing Rock, turn to the left, by\r\nWellersley Castle grounds, having on the right a bold escarpment of\r\nmountain limestone, with layers of chert in nodules and amorphous\r\nmasses. At Cromford Canal, the limestone suddenly terminates, and\r\nsinks beneath the surrounding alluvial silt of the river valley, and\r\nthe millstone grit. We will chip off a few specimens of the chert, to\r\nexamine at leisure. Crossing the bridge, the road winds round the foot\r\nof the hills of sandstone, which lie on our left, while on the right\r\nis the valley of the Derwent, and the river is seen here and there\r\nthrough openings in the copses and hedge-rows, meandering through the\r\nrich meadow-lands of the valley, which are flanked on the west by a\r\nmagnificent range of lofty hills, clothed with the luxuriant woods of\r\nAlderwasley. The character of the scenery from this point of the road,\r\ntill we ascend the high ground, is faithfully and graphically portrayed\r\nby Mr. Rhodes.[806]\r\n\r\n[806] Derbyshire Tourist’s Guide, p. 48.\r\n\r\n \"The road lies through a beautiful valley by the side of the Derwent;\r\n sloping meadows, crowned high above with a long range of magnificent\r\n woods, skirt the road-side on the left: on the right the river,\r\n pursuing its winding way beneath the umbrageous branches of oak,\r\n ash, alder, hazel, and sycamore, and bubbling as it passes along,\r\n is a beautiful object. About two miles below Cromford-bridge, the\r\n road leaves the more open part of the valley, and plunges into the\r\n thick woods that environ the little hamlet of Lea; a lovely spot,\r\n romantically situated by the side of a sparkling stream, in a deep\r\n hollow, amongst steep hills covered with foliage, and fields of the\r\n freshest verdure. The houses of this secluded village, with the\r\n exception of here and there a comfortable cottage, are handsome\r\n residences, nestling among orchards and parterres of flowers.\r\n Everything was flourishing most luxuriantly; and when we passed\r\n through the place, the hollyhocks, dahlias, and roses were in full\r\n blossom, and gave an extremely bright and cheerful aspect to the\r\n scene. The road continues through _Lea Wood_ to _Holloway_ by a\r\n very steep ascent, and from the toll-gate at the top of the hill it\r\n traverses the side of a mountainous ridge, covered with wood and\r\n intervening rock. The prospect is now magnificent: on the right a\r\n scene of great extent opens to the view, rich in all that constitutes\r\n the highest beauty in landscape. The summits of the two ranges of\r\n hills that form the eastern and western boundaries of the fertile\r\n valley at our feet are here from three to four miles apart; and\r\n the extent from north to south is from ten to twelve. Many minor\r\n eminences, rich with wood and intervening verdure, adorn this\r\n enchanting scene, through which the Derwent, sometimes hidden by\r\n overhanging trees, and sometimes sparkling with light, flows with busy\r\n speed and uninterrupted current by Belper, Milford, and Duffield,\r\n to Derby; the whole presenting an assemblage of splendid scenery\r\n finely diversified and rich in picturesque beauty. The woods of\r\n Alderwasley, that cover the hills from below Whatstandwell-bridge, to\r\n the dark pine-crowned eminence of Stonnis, are peculiarly imposing and\r\n magnificent.\"\r\n\r\nNear the village of Holloway there are several quarries opened on the\r\nside of the hill, which enable us to ascertain that this range is\r\ncomposed of strata of millstone grit and sandstone, highly inclined\r\nand dipping from the hill. The beds are so split and shattered in\r\nevery direction, that no large blocks can be procured, and the stone,\r\nalthough a good building material, is therefore only employed in the\r\nconstruction of the cottages and houses in the immediate vicinity. The\r\n_vignette_ of this volume represents a mass of the inclined sandstone\r\nstrata near this place. The reader will recollect that the hills on the\r\nopposite side of the valley, on our right, are also composed of similar\r\nstrata; and that the ridge, covered with fir-trees, marks the bold\r\nescarpment of the millstone grit at Stonnis, over Cromford; so that the\r\ngeological horizon of the valley, as seen from this spot, is wholly\r\nformed by the millstone grits and sandstones. A mile beyond Holloway\r\ntoll-gate, the road turns to the left, and the bare dome of mountain\r\nlimestone of Crich Hill is before us. We soon arrive at a limestone\r\nquarry, in which the strata are seen to be distinctly arched (see\r\n_Lign. 271_, p. 886), as in the cliff at Matlock _Church Tor_.\r\n\r\nWe will alight here to examine the rock more closely, and obtain\r\nspecimens. Here we see that the strata are inclined both to the right\r\nand to the left, and also lean towards the central axis of the hill\r\nin front of us; presenting such an appearance as would be afforded\r\nby an excavation made in an onion, or other spheroidal body, formed\r\nof a series of concentric layers. The limestone in this quarry is of\r\nthe usual subcrystalline character, abounding in shells, principally\r\n_Spirifer_. There are numerous vertical and oblique fissures in the\r\nrock, and these are more or less incrusted with minerals and spars,\r\nwhich have evidently been deposited by electro-chemical action, and\r\nadmirably exemplify the manner in which the rich veins of lead, &c.\r\nare distributed in the strata of the interior of the mountain. In a\r\ncrevice of the rock, in which the mineral contents were undisturbed,\r\nthe arrangement of the prevailing minerals of this part of Derbyshire,\r\nnamely, galena (_sulphuret of lead_), sulphate of barytes (here termed\r\n_cawk_), and fluor spar, was beautifully displayed. A layer of the blue\r\nsulphuret of lead, or galena, was spread over the surface of limestone\r\nforming the walls of the fissure: upon this was a thick stratum of\r\nwhite sulphate of barytes; and on the latter, fluor spar, of a light\r\nblue colour, forming cubic crystals on the surface nearest the cavity\r\nof the fissure, which therefore appeared to be lined with crystals of\r\nfluor.[807]\r\n\r\n[807] The workmen at this and the other quarries generally have\r\nspecimens of the fossils and minerals for sale, at moderate prices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRAP OF CRICH HILL.]\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile beyond, we arrive at Wakebridge, near which there\r\nare several very productive lead mines. The \"_Glory-mine_,\" one of\r\nthe richest in Derbyshire, is said, some ten years since, to have\r\nbeen worth from thirty to forty thousand pounds a-year.[808] A mining\r\nestablishment, on the left hand, where a powerful steam-engine\r\nis constantly at work, affords numerous specimens of the usual I\r\nDerbyshire spars and minerals; and from among the heaps of refuse\r\nthrown by the visitor may make an interesting collection. Near this\r\nspot, a vertical shaft was sunk in the side of the hill, in search\r\nfor lead ore, and at the depth of twenty fathoms, a rock of _compact\r\nTrap_ was reached; the work was continued for a few yards deeper, but\r\nultimately abandoned as fruitless. A gallery was subsequently driven\r\ninto the side of the hill, lower down, and here, too, the trap was\r\nfound; thus proving the existence of a central protrusion of igneous\r\nrock, over which the bent strata of mountain limestone are now disposed\r\nin consecutive layers. Numerous blocks of this compact trap or basalt,\r\nsome of which are veined with red jasper, lie scattered about the\r\nsite of the old shaft, and an interesting suite of specimens may be\r\ncollected. Pursuing our way, the limestone strata are seen in openings\r\non the hill side, having the same remarkable arrangement as those\r\nbefore described.\r\n\r\n[808] Derbyshire Tourist, p. 50.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving where the road divides,[809] we must proceed on foot and\r\nvisit the quarries, and examine the exposed masses of rock, that we may\r\nclearly comprehend the structure of the mountain. We will now ascend\r\nby the pathway that leads to the summit, and on the left several good\r\nsections of the strata are displayed. On reaching the tower on the\r\ncrest of the mountain (_Lign. 272_, p. 887), a magnificent panorama\r\nbursts upon our sight; but which no language can adequately describe.\r\nHere and there bare pinnacles of rifted rock protrude through the green\r\nsward; and masses of white, yellowish, and pink sulphate of barytes,\r\npyrites, fluor, and other minerals lie strewn upon the surface.[810]\r\n\r\n[809] The carriage should here be sent on to the village, and orders\r\ngiven for refreshments.\r\n\r\n[810] Good specimens may often be obtained from the piles of stones,\r\nand from the walls on the side of the hill.\r\n\r\nHaving reposed for some time at the foot of the tower to enjoy the\r\nglorious prospect spread around us, correct our notes, look over, trim,\r\nand wrap up our specimens, we will now descend to the north-eastern\r\nside of the hill, that the appearance of the strata on that aspect may\r\nalso be examined. But ere we leave the summit, again let me call your\r\nattention to its external configuration. Were it not on too extended a\r\nscale, we might suppose that we were standing on an ancient earth-work,\r\nor encampment, formed of limestone, surrounded by a deep fosse or\r\nditch, and flanked by precipitous embankments of millstone grit and\r\nsandstone, so strongly defined are the physical features of this\r\nremarkable mountain.\r\n\r\nWe will now visit a large quarry on the eastern side, which presents a\r\nfine section of the limestone strata, above 100 feet thick (see _Lign.\r\n271_), and which, like those we have previously observed, are disposed\r\nin curves, and enfold, as it were, the central axis of the hill; and\r\nthe rock is shivered and fissured in every direction. A thick bed of\r\ndrift, or alluvial debris, covers the limestone strata, as shown in\r\n_Lign. 271_; and in it, partially rolled blocks of sandstone, some\r\nof them of great size, are imbedded. The direction of the dip of the\r\nstrata in this quarry is indicated by the arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawn by Henry Carr, Esq. C. E. del^{t.}_ _J. Whimper,\r\nlign^{t.}_\r\n\r\nLign. 271. Quarry of Mountain Limestone, Crich Hill.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VIEW OF CRICH HILL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawn by Henry Carr, Esq. C. E._ _J. Whimper, lign^{t.}_\r\n\r\nLign. 272. View of Crich Hill, Derbyshire, from the West.]\r\n\r\nLet us now take a retrospect of the facts investigate during this\r\nmorning’s ramble, and consider how far Mr. Bakewell’s interpretation\r\nof these phenomena (see p. 879) is in accordance with the data we\r\nhave obtained. The outline of Crich Hill, as seen from a moderate\r\ndistance, is that of an insulated oblong dome, encircled by precipitous\r\nescarpments, or angular eminences of less elevation. The annexed sketch\r\n(_Lign. 272_), by my friend, Henry Carr, Esq. C.E., of Duffield, to\r\nwhom I am also indebted for a survey of Crich Hill, and admeasurements\r\nof the dip of the strata, will render this feature in the physical\r\ngeography of the country more apparent.\r\n\r\n In _Lign. 272_, the protruded elongated cone of mountain limestone\r\n is denoted by the tower, or _Stand_, on the summit; and the other\r\n heights, and the foreground, are composed of millstone grit and\r\n sandstone. The highest point of limestone is 716 feet above the level\r\n of the Derwent in the adjacent valley; and was estimated by Mr.\r\n Bakewell at about 900 feet above the level of the sea. The hill of\r\n sandstone on the right, on which the mill stands, is 402 feet high,\r\n and conceals Crich village in this view; that in the middle distance,\r\n on the left, marked _a_, is 400 feet high.\r\n\r\nThis disposition of the millstone escarpments around the central cone\r\nof elevated limestone is shown more in detail in the ground-plan,\r\n_Lign. 273_.\r\n\r\nThus we perceive that the strata of mountain-limestone dip from the\r\ncentre of the hill in every direction, as indicated by the arrows, at\r\nvarious angles, from 20° to 50°; and those of the sandstone hills,\r\nwhich form an irregular zone around Crich, are also highly inclined,\r\nand in like manner dip from the central axis, as is shown by the\r\ndirection of the arrows. Now we know, by observations made in places\r\nwhere the relative position of the Millstone and Limestone has suffered\r\nno disturbance, that these two series of strata were originally\r\ndisposed horizontally and conformably upon each other, thus--\r\n\r\n  1. _Uppermost_--Millstone Grit and Sandstone.\r\n                  -----------------------------\r\n  2. _Lowermost_--Mountain Limestone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROUND PLAN OF CRICH HILL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 273. Ground Plan of Crich Hill, _Derbyshire_.\r\n\r\n(_Scale, one inch to a mile._)\r\n\r\nBy Henry Carr, Esq. C. E. from actual Survey.]\r\n\r\n The area, enclosed within a line, and marked _Stand, Crich Hill_, is\r\n the elevated oblong dome of _limestone_. All the surrounding country\r\n is composed of _millstone grit_ and _sandstone_.\r\n\r\n The arrows on the boundary line of Crich Hill denote the direction\r\n of the dip of the limestone strata in nine positions measured and\r\n determined by Mr. Carr. The dip vanes from 20 to 50, the greatest\r\n inclination is on the south-east of the tower.\r\n\r\n The arrows on the surrounding millstone escarpments mark the dip of\r\n those strata in a sufficient number of stations, to convey a general\r\n idea of the position of the mountain masses environing Crich Hill.[811]\r\n\r\n[811] At Whatstandwell, abridge crosses the Derwent; and dose by, there\r\nis the Bull Inn, where good accommodation and sleeping apartments maybe\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRICH HILL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 274. Section of Crich Hill; from A to B on the\r\nplan, _Lign. 273_.\r\n\r\n(_Natural scale._)\r\n\r\nBy Reginald Neville Mantell.]\r\n\r\n  A, B.--Strata of _Millstone Grit_, highly inclined, and dipping from the\r\n           central axis.\r\n         Protrusion of the Mountain Limestone, on the summit of which is\r\n           Crich Tower, 716 feet above the level of the river Derwent.\r\n         Central mass of Trap, reached by a vertical shaft from\r\n           above, and by a gallery on the side of the hill.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident, that at Crich the strata No. 2 must have been\r\nforced up, and protruded through the strata No. 1, or they could not\r\noccupy their present position. We remarked, on ascending Holloway Hill,\r\nthe great disturbance which the Millstone beds had sustained (see the\r\nvignette of this volume); and the shaft and gallery near Wakebridge (p.\r\n884) disclosed the existence of a mass of basalt, or _trap_, of unknown\r\nextent, beneath the limestone, in the centre of the mountain; while the\r\nfissures and crevices, filled with metallic ores and spars, attest the\r\naction of intense heat, under great pressure. According to a survey\r\nmade by my son, a section in the line marked A--B on the plan, _Lign.\r\n273_, presents the arrangement of the strata seen in _Lign. 274_: the\r\nheights are from actual admeasurements.\r\n\r\nFrom the data thus obtained, we may construct an ideal section in\r\nillustration of these phenomena, as in the following diagram (_Lign.\r\n275_).\r\n\r\nHere then, as Mr. Bakewell forcibly observed, \"we have cause and effect\r\nin conjunction.\" Here is the cooled and consolidated molten rock, whose\r\nexpansive force elevated the horizontal strata of limestone, and forced\r\nthem through the superincumbent beds of grit and sandstone. But this\r\neruption must have taken place under great pressure, and at the bottom\r\nof the sea; for, had the phenomena been sub-aërial, the result would\r\nhave been altogether of a different nature; and we should have had\r\ncooled lava streams, and not masses of basalt.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the strata rise round and enfold this central\r\nnucleus of volcanic rock, displaying nearly hemispherical segments\r\nand curves. Now if we suppose a vertical transverse fissure across\r\nsuch a hill as that represented in the diagram (_Lign. 275_), the face\r\nof the remaining strata would be in every respect similar to that of\r\nthe High Tor (see _Lign. 270_, p. 876); namely, a mass of _Trap_, or\r\n_toadstone_, at the base, and a series of arched strata of limestone\r\nabove; with fissures containing ores of lead, zinc, barytes, &c. and\r\nvarious kinds of spar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lign. 275. Ideal transverse Section of Crich Hill.]\r\n\r\n  A, A.--Highly inclined strata of _Millstone Grit_.\r\n\r\n  B, B.--Arched strata of _Mountain Limestone_.\r\n\r\n     C.--A central nucleus of _Trap_ or _Toadstone_.\r\n\r\nTo a mind accustomed to investigations of this nature, a slight\r\nexamination of the phenomena under review will, I apprehend, suffice to\r\ndemonstrate the correctness of these deductions; but I may have failed\r\nto place the subject before the general reader in an intelligible and\r\nlucid point of view; should this be the case, still, if the attempt\r\nto present a familiar exposition of the physical structure of this\r\nremarkable district shall induce him to visit the scenes I have so\r\nimperfectly portrayed, and interrogate Nature in a right spirit, the\r\nhours we have passed together in our excursion to Crich Hill will not\r\nhave been spent in vain; for in the beautiful language of the noble\r\nbard:--\r\n\r\n     \"To sit on rocks, to muse o’er flood and fell,\r\n     To slowly trace the forest’s shady scene,\r\n     Where things that own not man’s dominion dwell,\r\n     And mortal foot hath ne’er or rarely been;\r\n     To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,\r\n     With the wild flock that never needs a fold;\r\n     Alone o’er steeps and foaming falls to lean;\r\n     This is not solitude; ’tis but to hold\r\n    Converse with Nature’s charms, and view her stores\r\n       unroll’d.\"--Childe Harold, Canto II. xxv.\r\n\r\n Specimens of Fossils and Minerals.--On our return, our first care must\r\n be to look over all the specimens we have gathered, arrange them,\r\n and select those which are the most illustrative of the phenomena\r\n we have examined; and ticket every specimen, as recommended in the\r\n Instructions. The fossils, consisting of several species of _spirifer_\r\n and other brachiopoda, and of portions of encrinital stems, require no\r\n particular care. The rocks should comprise specimens of the different\r\n varieties of limestone and sandstone; and of the green limestone,\r\n altered by contact with the toadstone; and examples of the compact\r\n trap, and of the variety veined with red jasper,--of the amygdaloidal\r\n toadstone,--and the vesicular, or that in which the cavities are\r\n empty. The minerals should comprise the ores of lead, zinc, barytes,\r\n fluor, and calcareous spar; of the last some good clear pieces should\r\n be selected, that will exhibit its double refracting property. Of the\r\n common metal, _Pyrites_, a few specimens should be preserved; this\r\n mineral, from its splendid yellow appearance, is often mistaken for\r\n gold; but a mere blow of the hammer will immediately detect it, for\r\n _Pyrites_ is brittle, and readily cracks to pieces, while gold, as is\r\n well known, is remarkably ductile. If the collector be not satisfied\r\n with the fruits of his day’s researches, he should look over the\r\n catalogue of Mr. Adams, and purchase such specimens as will render his\r\n collection sufficiently extensive to present a full illustration of\r\n the geological character of the scenes he has this day visited.\r\n\r\n There is a variety of sulphate of barytes from near Youlgreave\r\n exhibited in the shops at Matlock, of which one or two examples should\r\n be obtained. The surface of the polished specimens much resembles the\r\n rich variegated appearance of dark tortoise-shell. This mineral has\r\n been formed, like the common calcareous stalactite, by infiltration\r\n through some porous rock; transverse sections exhibit concentric\r\n layers of various shades; while the longitudinal have the varied\r\n colours disposed like those in tortoise-shell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BONSAL VALLEY.]\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR A GEOLOGICAL EXCURSION BY CROMFORD, UP BONSAL VALLEY, BY VIA\r\nGELLIA, TO MIDDLETON MOOR; RETURNING BY STONNIS.\r\n\r\nThis excursion will present many objects of interest, and one day at\r\nleast should be devoted to the examination of the different localities\r\npointed out in the following notes.[812] To Cromford, and then take the\r\nroad that leads through Bonsal vale. A fine range of limestone on the\r\nright, and a sparkling stream (Bonsal-brook) on the left. On the banks\r\nof this brook there is a manufactory of mineral colours (Pooley’s)\r\nwell worthy a visit. But before we reach this establishment, there is\r\nan opening on the hill side where the strata are exposed, and a bed of\r\nTrap is seen beneath the limestone; near this place specimens of fluor,\r\ncalc-spar, &c., that have been thrown out in forming the excavation,\r\nmay be collected. From beneath the trap a warm spring issues and flows\r\ninto the neighbouring brook.\r\n\r\n[812] Benjamin Froggatt should be engaged to conduct the pedestrian;\r\nand a carriage party would also do well to place themselves under his\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nProceed up the road leading to _Via Gellia_, and through a valley\r\nflanked with high ranges of limestone and dun-stone. On the right,\r\nis the beautiful cascade previously mentioned, near _Dunsley_. This\r\nvalley is a celebrated botanical region, for several species of plants\r\nwhich are of great rarity or unknown elsewhere are here met with. At\r\nthe direction post, turn to the left up the steep hill that leads\r\nto Middleton Moor. On each side numerous fossils of the mountain\r\nlimestone may be collected from the blocks lying on the flanks of the\r\nhill. Views splendid in picturesque scenery and of a highly interesting\r\ngeological character are obtained as we ascend. On the summit of\r\nMiddleton Moor, which is from 1,300 to 1,400 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, a most extensive panoramic view of the surrounding country may\r\nbe obtained. The geological map will enable the observer to identify\r\nthe crags of Charnwood Forest, the High Peak, &c. &c. Almost every part\r\nof the Moor is studded with the disused shafts of exhausted mines, and\r\nwhich are so carelessly covered over as to be extremely dangerous,\r\nand the visitor must bear this caution in mind; for the heaps of\r\nstone placed at irregular intervals on the hill, and which tempt the\r\ngeologist to seek for specimens, are for the most part piled over the\r\nopenings of deep shafts.[813]\r\n\r\n[813] My son narrowly escaped being drawn in by a heap of stones which\r\ngave way under his feet, and suddenly disappeared in the chasm below.\r\nIn rambles of this kind in a mining country, the young geologist must,\r\ntherefore, be upon his guard, or he may be engulphed with masses of\r\nlimestone in some deep chasm, and his bones, incrusted with stalactite,\r\nform an ossiferous breccia, that in future ages may perplex some\r\ncollector of organic remains to determine its relative antiquity!\r\n\r\nPass on by Worksworth, to the quarries of mountain limestone, where the\r\nencrinital marble, so largely employed for side-boards, chimney-pieces,\r\n&c. is procured. Near the approach to the entrance of the quarry,\r\nan instructive example of curved strata of limestone is seen on the\r\nleft; and on the right, a fine vertical artificial section. On the\r\nweathered surface of the left side of this entrance, and on the face\r\nnearest the quarry, good specimens of the stems I and ossicula of the\r\nusual Derbyshire crinoidea may be extracted (p. 284) from the layers\r\nof reddish limestone; and good blocks of the marble may be selected.\r\nLarge spirifers can be procured from the limestone in these quarries;\r\nthe quarry-men often have specimens. On the right hand of the entrance,\r\nlayers of flinty slate (called partings of _black bind_ by the miners)\r\noccur between the beds of limestone. In a field near this quarry, on\r\nthe left of the road leading to Cromford, where some mining operations\r\nare going on, blocks of the stone called _chert_ have been thrown up,\r\nand often contain beautiful examples of the pulley-stones (p. 285), or\r\nsiliceous casts of the stems of the crinoidea. A large collection of\r\nfossils may be gathered in the localities above mentioned.\r\n\r\nWe now drive to the escarpment of millstone grit at Stonnis, called\r\n_Black-rock_, whose pine-clad summit forms so conspicuous an object\r\nin the view from Crich Hill; it is about a mile from Cromford, and\r\noverlooks Matlock Dale.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the road, the refuse workings of a mine cover the\r\nside of the hill; among which some specimens of spars or minerals may\r\nperhaps be found.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VIEW FROM STONNIS.]\r\n\r\nBut the grand attraction of Stonnis is the view of Matlock Dale and\r\nthe surrounding mountains, obtained from the verge of the precipitous\r\nescarpment of sandstone rocks, under the knoll of pines. It is, indeed,\r\na scene of transcendent beauty and magnificence, and is said, by one\r\nwho has ascended every mountain top and traversed every ravine and\r\nvalley in this district, to be unrivalled.\r\n\r\n \"In that species of beauty which in landscape scenery approaches to\r\n grandeur, it is unequalled in Derbyshire. The parts of which it is\r\n composed are of the first order of fine things, and they are combined\r\n with a felicity that but rarely occurs in nature. Scarthing Rock, the\r\n woods of Willersley Castle, Matlock High Tor, the hills of Masson,\r\n Crich, and Riber are all noble objects; and the rude masses that\r\n constitute the foreground of the picture are thrown together, and\r\n grouped and coloured in a manner strikingly picturesque. I have scaled\r\n the highest eminences in the mountainous districts of Derbyshire--seen\r\n from their summits the lovely dales that repose in H tranquil beauty\r\n at their base--marked the multitude of hills included within the\r\n wide horizon they command, and my heart has thrilled with emotion at\r\n the sight; but not an eminence that I ever before ascended--not a\r\n prospect, however rich, and varied, which I thence beheld--is at all\r\n comparable with the view from Stonnis.\"[814]\r\n\r\n[814] Derbyshire Tourist’s Guide, p. 42.\r\n\r\nEvery one possessed of taste and feeling who gazes upon this glorious\r\nlandscape will partake, in a greater or lesser degree, of the emotions\r\nthus finely expressed by the ardent lover of the sublime and beautiful\r\nin nature; but to the natural philosopher the physical characters of\r\nthis enchanting region are fraught with a deeper interest, and present\r\nsubjects for the most profound contemplation. To him the rocks and the\r\nmountains are the grand monuments of nature, on which are inscribed the\r\nhistory of the physical revolutions of the globe which took place in\r\nperiods incalculably remote and long antecedent to the creation of the\r\nhuman race. They present to his mind a succession of events, each so\r\nvast as to be beyond his finite comprehension; ages of tranquillity,\r\nwith lands and seas teeming with life and happiness, succeeded by\r\nperiods in which the earthquake and the volcano spread universal ruin\r\nand destruction--and they teach him that all these awful changes bear\r\nthe impress of the Almighty’s hand, and were subservient to the eternal\r\npurpose of rendering this planet the fit abode of man, during his\r\nmortal pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nNOTES FOR A GEOLOGICAL EXCURSION TO CHARNWOOD FOREST, TO EXAMINE THE\r\nCENTRAL GROUP OF PLUTONIC ROCKS OF ENGLAND; AND THE CARBONIFEROUS AND\r\nCAMBRIAN STRATA, THROUGH WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ERUPTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the central county of our Island, within a hundred miles of the\r\nTertiary deposits of the South-east of England, a group of plutonic\r\nrocks emerges from beneath the strata of limestone, coal, and red marl\r\nwhich constitute the principal geological features of the midland\r\nprovinces, and rises up into the bold and picturesque range of hills\r\nof Charnwood Forest. Almost the entire series of British rocks is now\r\nbrought by the railroads within a few hours distance of the metropolis;\r\nand the geological inquirer may, in the course of a fortnight, examine\r\nin their natural situations the Eocene deposits of the London and\r\nHampshire basins--the Cretaceous and Wealden strata of Sussex, Kent,\r\nand Surrey--the Oolitic, Liassic, Triassic, Permian, and Carboniferous\r\nsystems--the Mountain limestone and its metalliferous treasures--Traps,\r\nor ancient lavas, and their effects--strata of the Silurian and\r\nCambrian systems--and, lastly, Granite, Syenite, Porphyry, and other\r\nmodifications of the plutonic or igneous rocks. The present notes refer\r\nto two or three days spent in exploring the country around Leicester,\r\nand in examining the granite of Mount Sorel[815]--the slate quarries of\r\nSwithland--the syenitic crags of Bardon Hill--the porphyritic masses\r\nof Markfield and Grooby--and the coal-mines of Whitwick. On our\r\nprevious excursion by railway to Leicester (see Excursion to Matlock,\r\np. 867), the order of the succession of the strata from the metropolis\r\nto that town was described; on this occasion it will only be requisite\r\nto direct the traveller’s attention to the abrupt isolated hills, by\r\nHinckley, Grooby, and the craggy peaks of Charnwood Forest, in the\r\ndistance, on the left of the railroad, before reaching Leicester. If a\r\npedestrian excursion be resolved upon, three or four days at least will\r\nbe required to follow the route presently pointed out; in a carriage\r\nand pair, it may be accomplished in a long summer s day, by starting\r\nfrom Leicester at six, and returning by ten or eleven.[816]\r\n\r\n[815] Sorel, a corruption of _Soar Hill_, or hill on the river Soar.\r\n\r\n[816] It maybe well to remind the visitor that at Leicester the\r\nfollowing objects are worthy of notice:--the Roman Milestone, now\r\nplaced in the High-street; the remains of the Roman Wall; and the Blue\r\nBoar Hotel, where Richard III. slept the night before the battle of\r\nBosworth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCURSION TO CHARNWOOD FOREST]\r\n\r\nThe geological localities to be visited in this excursion are the\r\nfollowing--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Barrow-on-Soar.[817] _Lias limestone._--The quarries at this\r\nlocality are celebrated for the organic remains that have from time\r\nto time been obtained from the limestone. Bones of Ichthyosauri and\r\nPlesiosauri (see p. 669), fishes (_Dapedius_, p. 603), leaves of\r\ncycadeæ, and fossil wood, together with ammonites, terebratulæ, &c. may\r\ngenerally be obtained.\r\n\r\n[817] There is a station at Barrow, and the pedestrian may be put down\r\nwithin a short distance, by the railway.\r\n\r\nAlthough at the very foot of the plutonic rocks, and on the verge of\r\nthe grand focus of volcanic action which erupted the syenitic masses\r\nof Charnwood Forest, the strata in this spot appear to have suffered\r\nbut little disturbance. But this phenomenon is in accordance with\r\nwhat occurs in other volcanic districts. For, as M. Constant Prevost\r\nremarks, volcanoes may open across all the strata, without occasioning\r\ngreat derangements; thus, at Limagne, Aurillac, and Puy (see _Wond._\r\np. 269), the tertiary strata have preserved their horizontality, even\r\naround the vents through which issued the volcanic matter that covered\r\nthose countries with numerous cones of eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Mount Sorel. _Granite and Syenite._--The road from Leicester\r\nascends a ridge of Triassic or New Red strata, called Birstal Hill,\r\nfrom whence there is a fine view of the town. In the meadows on the\r\nleft, some ruined walls, covered with ivy, mark the site, and are the\r\nonly remains of the Abbey in which Cardinal Wolsey expired. Approaching\r\nMount Sorel, an abrupt hill, with a mill on the summit, denotes, from a\r\nconsiderable distance, the geological character of the spot. There is\r\na small Inn in the village, where accommodation may be procured. Visit\r\nthe quarries, and also the establishment of Mr. Jackson, where the\r\ngranite is worked into pillars, side-boards, &c.[818]\r\n\r\n[818] An interesting account of this manufactory will be found in Sir\r\nRichard Phillips’s \"Personal Tour.\"\r\n\r\nThe hill is about 120 feet in height, and 1,400 yards long; and is\r\nestimated to contain about two hundred millions of cubic feet of\r\nworkable granite, above the general level of the district.[819]\r\n\r\n[819] The granite resembles that of Aberdeen, but contains a larger\r\nproportion of felspar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Swithland. _Slate-rocks._--From Mount Sorel proceed to Swithland:\r\nas we approach the quarries, the employment of slate for every\r\navailable purpose, in the footpaths, walls of cottages, &c., indicates\r\nthe abundance of this material in the neighbourhood. At Swithland, the\r\nquarries are very extensive, and expose magnificent sections, from 100\r\nto 120 feet thick, of strata of Slate, highly inclined; and forming one\r\nside of an anticlinal axis, the summit of which will be passed over\r\nin our route by Woodhouse. In one quarry, at the time of my visit,\r\na series of nearly horizontal strata of red marl was exposed, lying\r\nunconformably upon the edges of the highly inclined beds of Slate. The\r\nSlate-rocks of Charnwood Forest have a single anticlinal axis, which\r\nstrikes from NN.W. to SS.E.; and the axis of the adjacent coal-field of\r\nNuneaton has a similar direction.[820]\r\n\r\n[820] Murch. Sil. Syst. p. 569.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WOODHOUSE. BARDON HILL.]\r\n\r\nIV. Woodhouse. _Slate-rocks._--From Swithland to Woodhouse, is a\r\ncontinuation of the highly inclined Slate strata. The village is\r\nromantically situated on the ridge or crest of the anticlinal axis\r\nof Charnwood Forest. On the sides of the road, there are occasional\r\nopenings where the strata are exposed. There is, in particular, a fine\r\nsection on the sides of the elevated point on which the church and\r\nschool are built, lying to the left of the road in the approach from\r\nSwithland. A day might be well spent in this place, and at Swithland.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Bardon Hill. _Syenite._--We next proceed to Bardon Hill, ascending\r\nto the highest ridge of the protruded mass of igneous rock, of which\r\nthis mountain-range is composed. The craggy and bare pinnacles which\r\nare every where presenting themselves, shooting up, as it were, from\r\nthe green sward, cannot fail, from their novel and striking character,\r\nstrongly to impress the mind of the young geologist, who now, for\r\nthe first time, visits a region of plutonic rocks. The view from the\r\nsummit of the hill is grand and imposing; it should be studied with\r\na geological map of the country before us, that the position of this\r\ncentral mass of volcanic rocks, and its relation to the surrounding\r\nsedimentary strata, may be fully comprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Whitwick and Snibstone. _Coal-measures._--Spread around the foot\r\nof the Syenitic mountain which we are descending are the coal-bearing\r\nstrata of the Carboniferous system; and in the works at _Whitwick_\r\nand _Snibstone_ the geological inquirer can examine the nature of\r\nthese deposits in the coal-mines, which he should descend, and obtain\r\nspecimens of the strata and fossils from the beds in situ.[821]\r\n\r\n[821] Should he be so fortunate as to see the resident engineer\r\nof Snibstone Colliery, Mr. George Vaughan, he will be certain of\r\nmeeting with a courteous reception, and every facility for pursuing\r\nhis inquiries, descending the shaft, and obtaining fossils. Mountain\r\nlimestone is brought to this place to be converted into lime; and good\r\nspecimens of shells, encrinites, &c. may sometimes be extracted from\r\nthe blocks of stone.\r\n\r\nAmong the refuse of the workings thrown up from the various shafts,\r\nsearch should be made for stems of _calamites_ (p. 108), _seed-vessels_\r\n(p. 149), _fern-leaves_ (p. 109), &c.\r\n\r\nA section from Whitwick, through Charnwood Forest, to Barrow-on-Soar,\r\nin the direction of the route we have traversed, would give the\r\nfollowing succession of rocks:--1. Whitwick; _Coal-strata_, highly\r\ninclined. 2. _Slate-rocks_ of Woodhouse, highly inclined. 3.\r\nProtrusions of _Syenite_. 4. _Slate-rocks_ of Swithland, highly\r\ninclined, with unconformable strata of red marl. 5. _Granite_ and\r\n_Syenite_ of Mount Sorel. 6. _Red marl_ and _sandstone_, supporting the\r\n_Lias_, at Barrow-on-Soar.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian should spend one or two days at Snibstone, where there\r\nis humble, but comfortable accommodation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARKFIELD AND GROOBY,]\r\n\r\nVII. Markfield and Grooby. _Syenite and Porphyry_, &c.--These places\r\nmay be visited on our way back to Leicester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Dealers in Fossils, Minerals, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nBritish Natural History Society, for the distribution of Fossils and\r\nRecent Shells, London Agent for the, 30, Tavistock-street, Covent\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\nCharlton, Mr., at the Geological Society’s apartments, Somerset House.\r\nFor boards and tablets for fossils; prepared and backed paper for\r\ndiagrams; cabinets for specimens, &c.
