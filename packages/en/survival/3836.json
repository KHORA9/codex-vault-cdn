Years later, his son\r\nJohann (or Jean--accounts differ) Rudolf Wyss, by then a professor\r\nof philosophy, persuaded his father to allow him to complete and\r\nedit the unfinished manuscript. It was published in two volumes\r\nin Zurich in 1812-1813.\r\n\r\nIts French translator, Mme de Montholieu, obtained permission\r\nto greatly enlarge the book. It was published in five volumes\r\nfrom 1824 through 1826. The first English edition, abridged,\r\nwas published in 1814; it was followed by several other English\r\ntranslations of varying quality. In 1849 W. H. G. Kingston\r\nre-translated, and greatly abridged, Mme. De Montholieu's\r\nversion. Most English versions are based on Kingston's abridged\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nDespite a vast number of amusing errors in flora and fauna, the\r\nbook has entertained, and warmed the hearts of, many generations.\r\nHowever, most modern editions omit an incredible amount even of\r\nKingston's translation by making small cuttings here and there,\r\nsome of them maddeningly inept. The Editor's Cut edition from\r\nPink Tree Press has been based on, and compared with, no fewer\r\nthan five previous editions, all of them out of copyright. Most,\r\nthough not all, of the cuttings have been restored. The material\r\nthat continues to be omitted is of little imaginable interest to\r\nanyone other than a scholar of nineteenth century literature.\r\n\r\nParagraphing has been redone in order to facilitate ease of\r\nreading. Some archaic spelling and grammar have been retained,\r\nas they are part of the flavor of the book; they have been changed\r\nwhere necessary for clarity. The British-style punctuation has\r\nbeen retained. The lengthy and unnecessary chapter headings have\r\nbeen omitted. Some parenthetical information is provided, most\r\noften to define words no longer to be found in many English\r\ndictionaries.\r\n\r\nAnne Wingate, Ph.D.\r\nEditor-in-Chief\r\nPink Tree Press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nFor many days we had been tempest-tossed. Six times had the darkness\r\nclosed over a wild and terrific scene, and returning light as often\r\nbrought but renewed distress, for the raging storm increased in\r\nfury until on the seventh day all hope was lost.\r\n\r\nWe were driven completely out of our course; no conjecture\r\ncould be formed as to our whereabouts. The crew had lost heart,\r\nand were utterly exhausted by incessant labour. The riven masts\r\nhad gone by the board, leaks had been sprung in every direction,\r\nand the water, which rushed in, gained upon us rapidly.\r\n\r\nInstead of reckless oaths, the seamen now uttered frantic cries to\r\nGod for mercy, mingled with strange and often ludicrous vows, to\r\nbe performed should deliverance be granted. Every man on board\r\nalternately commended his soul to his Creator, and strove to\r\nbethink himself of some means of saving his life.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank as I looked round upon my family in the midst of\r\nthese horrors. Our four young sons were overpowered by terror.\r\n`Dear children,' said I, `if the Lord will, He can save us even\r\nfrom this fearful peril; if not, let us calmly yield our lives\r\ninto His hand, and think of the joy and blessedness of finding\r\nourselves for ever and ever united in that happy home above.\r\nEven death is not too bitter, when it does not separate those\r\nwho love one another.'\r\n\r\nAt these words my weeping wife looked bravely up, and, as the\r\nboys clustered round her, she began to cheer and encourage them\r\nwith calm and loving words. I rejoiced to see her fortitude,\r\nthough my heart was ready to break as I gazed on my dear ones.\r\n\r\nWe knelt down together, one after another praying with deep\r\nearnestness and emotion. Fritz, in particular, besought help\r\nand deliverance for his dear parents and brothers, as though\r\nquite forgetting himself. Our hearts were soothed by the never-\r\nfailing comfort of child-like confiding prayer, and the horrors\r\nof our situation seemed less overwhelming. `Ah,' thought I,\r\n`the Lord will hear our prayer! He will help us.'\r\n\r\nAmid the roar of the thundering waves I suddenly heard the cry\r\nof `Land! land!', while at the same instant the ship struck with\r\na frightful shock, which threw everyone to the deck, and seemed\r\nto threaten her immediate destruction. Dreadful sounds betokened\r\nthe breaking up of the ship, and the roaring waters poured in on\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\nThen the voice of the captain was heard above the tumult, shouting,\r\n`Lower away the boats! We are lost!'\r\n\r\n`Lost!' I exclaimed, and the word went like a dagger to my heart;\r\nbut seeing my children's terror renewed, I composed myself,\r\ncalling out cheerfully, `Take courage, my boys! We are all above\r\nwater yet. There is the land not far off, let us do our best to\r\nreach it. You know God helps those that help themselves! Remain\r\nwith your mother, while I go on deck to see what is best to be\r\ndone now.' With that, I left them and went on deck.\r\n\r\nA wave instantly threw me down; another followed, and then another,\r\nas I contrived to find my footing. The ship was shattered on all\r\ndirections, and on one side there was a large hole in the hull.\r\n\r\nForgetting the passengers, the ship's company crowded into the\r\nlifeboats, and the last who entered cut the davit ropes to cast\r\neach boat into the sea.\r\n\r\nWhat was my horror when through the foam and spray I beheld the\r\nlast remaining boat leave the ship, the last of the seamen spring\r\ninto her and push off, regardless of my cries and entreaties that\r\nwe might be allowed to share their slender chance of preserving\r\ntheir lives. My voice was drowned in the howling of the blast,\r\nand even had the crew wished it, the return of the boat was\r\nimpossible, for the waves were mountain-high.\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes despairingly around, I became gradually aware\r\nthat our position was by no means hopeless, inasmuch as the\r\nstern of the ship containing our cabin was jammed between two\r\nhigh rocks, and was partly raised from among the breakers which\r\ndashed the fore-part to pieces. As the clouds of mist and rain\r\ndrove past, I could make out, through rents in the vaporous\r\ncurtain, a line of rocky coast, and, rugged as it was, my heart\r\nbounded towards it as a sign of help in the hour of need.\r\n\r\nYet the sense of our lonely and forsaken condition weighed heavily\r\nupon me as I returned to my family, constraining myself to say\r\nwith a smile, `Courage, dear ones! Although our good ship will\r\nnever sail more, she is so placed that our cabin will remain\r\nabove water, and tomorrow, if the wind and waves abate, I see no\r\nreason why we should not be able to get ashore.'\r\n\r\nThese few words had an immediate effect on the spirits of my\r\nchildren, for my family had the habit of trusting in my assurances.\r\nThe boys at once regarded our problematical chance of escaping as\r\na happy certainty, and began to enjoy the relief from the violent\r\npitching and rolling of the vessel.\r\n\r\nMy wife, however, perceived my distress and anxiety in spite of\r\nmy forced composure, and I made her comprehend our real situation,\r\ngreatly fearing the effect of the intelligence on her nerves. Not\r\nfor a moment did her courage and trust in Providence forsake her,\r\nand on seeing this, my fortitude revived.\r\n\r\n`We must find some food, and take a good supper,' said she, `it\r\nwill never do to grow faint by fasting too long. We shall require\r\nour utmost strength tomorrow.'\r\n\r\nNight drew on apace, the storm was as fierce as ever, and at\r\nintervals we were startled by crashes announcing further damage\r\nto our unfortunate ship. We thought of the lifeboats, and feared\r\nthat all they contained must have sunk under the foaming waves.\r\n\r\n`God will help us soon now, won't He, father?' said my youngest\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n`You silly little thing,' said Fritz, my eldest son, sharply,\r\n`don't you know that we must not settle what God is to do for\r\nus? We must have patience and wait His time.'\r\n\r\n`Very well said, had it been said kindly, Fritz, my boy. You too\r\noften speak harshly to your brothers, although you may not mean\r\nto do so.'\r\n\r\nA good meal being now ready, my youngsters ate heartily, and\r\nretiring to rest were speedily fast asleep. Fritz, who was of\r\nan age to be aware of the real danger we were in, kept watch\r\nwith us. After a long silence, `Father,' said he, `don't you\r\nthink we might contrive swimming-belts for mother and the boys?\r\nWith those we might all escape to land, for you and I can swim.'\r\n\r\n`Your idea is so good,' answered I, `that I shall arrange something\r\nat once, in case of an accident during the night.'\r\n\r\nWe immediately searched about for what would answer the purpose,\r\nand fortunately got hold of a number of empty flasks and tin\r\ncanisters, which we connected two and two together so as to form\r\nfloats sufficiently buoyant to support a person in the water, and\r\nmy wife and young sons each willingly put one on. I then provided\r\nmyself with matches, dry tinder, knives, cord, and other portable\r\narticles, trusting that, should the vessel go to pieces before\r\ndaylight, we might gain the shore, not wholly destitute.\r\n\r\nFritz, as well as his brothers, now slept soundly. Throughout the\r\nnight my wife and I maintained our prayerful watch, dreading at\r\nevery fresh sound some fatal change in the position of the wreck.\r\n\r\nAt length the faint dawn of day appeared, the long weary night was\r\nover, and with thankful hearts we perceived that the gale had begun\r\n to moderate; blue sky was seen above us, and the lovely hues of\r\nsunrise adorned the eastern horizon.\r\n\r\nI aroused the boys, and we assembled on the remaining portion of\r\nthe deck, when they, to their surprise, discovered that no one\r\nelse was on board.\r\n\r\n`Hallo, papa! What has become of everybody? Are the sailors gone?\r\nHave they taken away the boats? Oh, papa! why did they leave us\r\nbehind? What can we do by ourselves!'\r\n\r\n`My good children,' I replied, `we must not despair, although we\r\nseem deserted. See how those on whose skill and good faith we\r\ndepended have left us cruelly to our fate in the hour of danger.\r\nGod will never do so. He has not forsaken us, and we will trust\r\nHim still. Only let us bestir ourselves, and each cheerily do his\r\nbest. Who has anything to propose?'\r\n\r\n`The sea will soon be calm enough for swimming,' said Fritz.\r\n\r\n`And that would be all very fine for you,' exclaimed Ernest, `for\r\nyou can swim, but think of mother and the rest of us! Why not\r\nbuild a raft and all get on shore together?'\r\n\r\n`We should find it difficult, I think, to make a raft that would\r\ncarry us safe to shore. However, we must contrive something, and\r\nfirst let each try to procure what will be of most use to us.'\r\n\r\nAway we all went to see what was to be found, I myself proceeding\r\nto examine, as of greatest consequence, the supplies of provisions\r\nand fresh water within our reach.\r\n\r\nMy wife took her youngest son, Franz, to help her to attend to the\r\nunfortunate animals on board, who were in a pitiful plight,\r\nhaving been neglected for several days.\r\n\r\nFritz hastened to the arms chest, Ernest to look for tools;\r\nand Jack went towards the captain's cabin, the door of which\r\nhe no sooner opened, than out sprang two splendid large dogs,\r\nwho testified their extreme delight and gratitude by such\r\ntremendous bounds that they knocked their little deliverer\r\ncompletely head over heels, frightening him nearly out of his\r\nwits.\r\n\r\nJack did not long yield either to fear or anger, he presently\r\nrecovered himself, the dogs seemed to ask pardon by vehemently\r\nlicking his face and hands, and so, seizing the larger by the\r\nears, he jumped on his back, and, to my great amusement, coolly\r\nrode to meet me as I came up the hatchway.  I could not refrain\r\nfrom laughing at the sight, and I praised his courage, but warned\r\nhim to be cautious and remember that animals of this species might,\r\nin a state of hunger, be dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhen we reassembled in the cabin, we all displayed our treasures.\r\n\r\nFritz brought a couple of guns, shot belt, powder-flasks, and\r\nplenty of bullets.\r\n\r\nErnest produced a cap full of nails, a pair of large scissors,\r\nan axe, and a hammer, while pincers, chisels and augers stuck\r\nout of all his pockets.\r\n\r\nEven little Franz* carried a box of no small size, and eagerly\r\nbegan to show us the `nice sharp little hooks' it contained.\r\nHis brothers smiled scornfully.\r\n\r\n   * Some editions translate this to Francis,\r\n     apparently to avoid confusion with Fritz.\r\n     I see no reason for the change, and am\r\n     retaining the original spelling. Ed.\r\n\r\n`Well, done, Franz!' cried I, `these fish hooks, which you the\r\nyoungest have found, may contribute more than anything else in\r\nthe ship to save our lives by procuring food for us. Fritz and\r\nErnest, you have chosen well.'\r\n\r\n`Will you praise me too?' said my dear wife. `I have nothing to\r\nshow, but I can give you good news. Some useful animals are still\r\nalive: a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, and a cow and a\r\nfine sow both big with young. I was but just in time to save\r\ntheir lives by taking food to them. The goats I milked, though\r\nI do not know how I shall preserve the milk in this dreadful heat.'\r\n\r\n`All these things are excellent indeed,' said I, `but my friend\r\nJack here has presented me with a couple of huge hungry useless\r\ndogs, who will eat more than any of us.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, papa! They will be of use! Why, they will help us to hunt\r\nwhen we get on shore!'\r\n\r\n`No doubt they will, if ever we do get on shore, Jack; but I\r\nmust say I don't know how it is to be done.'\r\n\r\n`Can't we each get into a big tub, and float there?' returned he.\r\n`I have often sailed splendidly like that, round the pond at home.'\r\n\r\n`My child, you have hit on a capital idea,' cried I. `That is\r\ncertainly worth trying. Now, Ernest, let me have your tools,\r\nhammers, nails, saws, augers, and all; and then make haste to\r\ncollect any tubs you can find!'\r\n\r\nWe very soon found four large casks, made of sound wood and\r\nstrongly bound with iron hoops; they were floating with many\r\nother things in the water in the hold, but we managed to fish\r\nthem out, and place them on the lower deck, which was at that\r\ntime scarcely above water. They were exactly what I wanted, and\r\nI succeeded in sawing them across the middle. Hard work it was,\r\nand we were glad enough to stop and refresh ourselves with goat's\r\nmilk, wine,* and biscuits.\r\n\r\n   * Even as late as this book was written, public\r\n     water was likely to be polluted. Children as well\r\n     as adults drank alcoholic beverages, often\r\n     considerably diluted with water, because it had\r\n     been observed that children who did not drink\r\n     plain water were more likely to survive childhood.\r\n\r\nMy eight tubs now stood ranged in a row near the water's edge,\r\nand I looked at them with great satisfaction; to my surprise,\r\nmy wife did not seem to share my pleasure!\r\n\r\n`I shall never,' said she, `muster courage to get into one\r\nof these!'\r\n\r\n`Do not be too sure of that, dear wife; when you see my contrivance\r\ncompleted, you will perhaps prefer it to this immovable wreck.'\r\n\r\nI next procured a long thin plank on which my tubs could be fixed,\r\nand the two ends of this I bent upwards so as to form a keel.\r\nOther two planks were nailed along the sides of the tubs; they,\r\nalso being flexible, were brought to a point at each end, and\r\nall firmly secured and nailed together, producing a kind of\r\nnarrow boat, divided into eight compartments, which I had no\r\ndoubt would float adequately in calm water. But when we thought\r\nall was ready for the launch, we found, to our dismay, that the\r\ngrand contrivance was so heavy and clumsy that even our united\r\nefforts could not move it an inch.\r\n\r\n`I must have a lever,' cried I. `Run and fetch the capstan bar!'\r\n\r\nFritz quickly brought one and, having formed rollers by cutting\r\nup a long spar, I raised the forepart of my boat with the bar,\r\nand my sons placed a roller under it.\r\n\r\n`How is it, father,' inquired Ernest, `that with that thing you\r\nalone can do more than all of us together?'\r\n\r\nI explained, as well as I could in a hurry, the principle of\r\nArchimedes' lever; from which he said he could move the world\r\nif he had a point from which his mechanism might operate, and\r\npromised to have a long talk on the subject of mechanics when\r\nwe should be safe on land.\r\n\r\nI now made fast a long rope to the stern of our boat, attaching\r\nthe other end to a beam; then placing a second and third roller\r\nunder it, we once more began to push, this time with success, and\r\nsoon our gallant craft was safely launched: so swiftly indeed did\r\nshe glide into the water that, if the rope had not been well\r\nsecured, she would have passed beyond our reach. The boys wished\r\nto jump in directly; but, alas, she leaned so much on one side\r\nthat they could not venture to do so.\r\n\r\nSome heavy things being thrown in, however, the boat righted\r\nitself by degrees, and the boys were so delighted that they\r\nstruggled which should first leap in to have the fun of sitting\r\ndown in the tubs. But it was plain to me at once that something\r\nmore was required to make her perfectly safe, so I contrived\r\noutriggers to preserve the balance, by nailing long poles across\r\nat the stem and stern, and fixing at the ends of each empty\r\nbrandy cask.\r\n\r\nThen, the boat appearing steady, I got in; and turning it towards\r\nthe most open side of the wreck, I cut and cleared away\r\nobstructions, so as to leave a free passage for our departure,\r\nand the boys brought oars to be ready for the voyage. This\r\nimportant undertaking we were forced to postpone until the\r\nnext day, as it was by this time far too late to attempt it.\r\n\r\nIt was not pleasant to have to spend another night in so precarious\r\na situation; but, yielding to necessity, we sat down to enjoy a\r\ncomfortable supper, for during our exciting and incessant work\r\nall day we had taken nothing but an occasional biscuit and a\r\nlittle wine.\r\n\r\nWe prepared for rest in a much happier frame of mind than on the\r\npreceding day, but I did not forget the possibility of a renewed\r\nstorm, and therefore made every one put on the belts as before.\r\nI persuaded my wife (not without considerable difficulty), to\r\nput on a sailor's dress, assuring her she would find it much\r\nmore comfortable and convenient for all she would have to go\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nShe at last consented to do this, and left us for a short time,\r\nreappearing with much embarrassment and many blushes, in a most\r\nbecoming suit, which she had found in a midshipman's chest.* We\r\nall admired her costume, and any awkwardness she felt soon\r\nbegan to pass off; then we retired to our hammocks, where peaceful\r\nsleep prepared us all for the exertions of the coming day.\r\n\r\n   * At the time this book was written, women always\r\n     wore long skirts. A woman wearing trousers would\r\n     be considered so shocking that if she were so garbed\r\n     on a public street she would probably be arrested\r\n     for indecency.\r\n\r\nWe rose up betimes, for sleep weighs lightly on the hopeful as\r\nwell as on the anxious. After kneeling together in prayer, `Now\r\nmy beloved ones,' said I, `with God's help we are about to effect\r\nour escape. Let the poor animals we must leave behind, be well\r\nfed, and put plenty of fodder within their reach: in a few days\r\nwe may be able to return, and save them likewise. After that,\r\ncollect everything you can think of which may be of use to us.'\r\n\r\nThe boys joyfully obeyed me; and I selected, from the large\r\nquantity of stores they got together, canvas to make a tent,\r\na chest of carpenter's tools, guns, pistols, powder, shot,\r\nand bullets, rods and fishing tackle, an iron pot, a case of\r\nportable soup and another of biscuit. These useful articles of\r\ncourse took the place of the ballast I had hastily thrown in\r\nthe day before; even so, the boys had brought so many things\r\nthat we were obliged to leave some of them for a future trip.\r\n\r\nWith a hearty prayer for God's blessing, we now began to take\r\nour seats, each in his tub. Just then we heard the cocks begin\r\nto crow and the chickens to cackle, as though to reproach us\r\nfor deserting them.\r\n\r\n`Why should not the fowls go with us!' exclaimed I. `If we find\r\nno food for them, they can be food for us!' Ten hens and a couple\r\nof cocks were accordingly placed in one of the tubs, and secured\r\nwith some wire-netting over them.\r\n\r\nThe ducks and geese were set at liberty, and took to the water at\r\nonce, while the pigeons, rejoicing to find themselves on the wing,\r\nswiftly made for the shore. My wife, who managed all this for me,\r\nkept us waiting for her some little time, and came at last with a\r\nbag as big as a pillow in her arms. `This is my contribution,'\r\nsaid she, throwing the bag to little Franz, to be, as I thought,\r\na cushion for him to sit upon, or to protect himself from being\r\ntossed from side to side.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, we cast off, and moved away from the wreck. My\r\ngood, brave wife sat in the first compartment of the boat; next\r\nher was Franz, a sweet-tempered, affectionate little boy, nearly\r\nsix years old. Then came Fritz, a handsome, spirited young fellow\r\nof fourteen; the two centre tubs contained the valuable cargo;\r\nthen came our bold, thoughtless Jack, ten years old; next him\r\ntwelve-year-old Ernest, my second son, intelligent, well-informed,\r\nand rather indolent. I myself, the anxious, loving father, stood\r\nin the stern, endeavouring to guide the raft with its precious\r\nburden to a safe landing-place.\r\n\r\nThe elder boys took the oars; everyone wore a float belt, and\r\nhad something useful close to him in case of being thrown into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe tide was flowing, which was a great help to the young oarsmen.\r\nWe emerged from the wreck and glided into the open sea. All eyes\r\nwere strained to get a full view of the land, and the boys pulled\r\nwith a will; but for some time we made no progress, as the boat\r\nkept turning round and round, until I hit upon the right way to\r\nsteer it, after which we merrily made for the shore.\r\n\r\nWe had left the two dogs, Turk and Juno, on the wreck, as being\r\nboth large mastiffs we did not care to have their additional\r\nweight on board our craft; but when they saw us apparently\r\ndeserting them, they set up a piteous howl, and sprang into\r\nthe sea. I was sorry to see this, for the distance to the land\r\nwas so great that I scarcely expected them to be able to\r\naccomplish it. They followed us, however, and, occasionally\r\nresting their fore-paws on the outriggers, kept up with us well.\r\nJack was inclined to deny them this their only chance of safety.\r\n\r\n`Stop,' said I, `that would be unkind as well as foolish; remember,\r\nthe merciful man regardeth the life of his beast. God has given\r\nthe dog to man to be his faithful companion and friend.'\r\n\r\nOur passage, though tedious, was safe; but the nearer we approached\r\nthe shore the less inviting it appeared; the barren rocks seemed\r\nto threaten us with misery and want.\r\n\r\nMany casks, boxes and bales of goods floated on the water around\r\nus. Fritz and I managed to secure a couple of hogsheads, so as\r\nto tow them alongside. With the prospect of famine before us, it\r\nwas desirable to lay hold of anything likely to contain provisions.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by we began to perceive that, between and beyond the\r\ncliffs, green grass and trees were discernible. Fritz could\r\ndistinguish many tall palms, and Ernest hoped they would prove\r\nto be cocoanut trees, and enjoyed the thoughts of drinking the\r\nrefreshing milk.\r\n\r\n`I am very sorry I never thought of bringing away the captain's\r\ntelescope,' said I.\r\n\r\n`Oh, look here, father!' cried Jack, drawing a little spy-glass\r\njoyfully out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nBy means of this glass, I made out that at some distance to the\r\nleft the coast was much more inviting; a strong current however\r\ncarried us directly towards the frowning rocks, but I presently\r\nobserved an opening, where a stream flowed into the sea, and saw\r\nthat our geese and ducks were swimming towards this place. I\r\nsteered after them into the creek, and we found ourselves in a\r\nsmall bay or inlet where the water was perfectly smooth and of\r\nmoderate depth. The ground sloped gently upwards from the low\r\nbanks to the cliffs which here retired inland, leaving a small\r\nplain, on which it was easy for us to land. Everyone sprang\r\ngladly out of the boat but little Franz, who, lying packed in\r\nhis tub like a potted shrimp, had to be lifted out by his mother.\r\n\r\nThe dogs had scrambled on shore before us; they received us with\r\nloud barking and the wildest demonstrations of delight. The\r\nchickens, geese and ducks kept up an incessant din, added to\r\nwhich was the screaming and croaking of flamingoes and penguins,\r\nwhose dominion we were invading. The noise was deafening, but far\r\nfrom unwelcome to me, as I thought of the good dinners the birds\r\nmight furnish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we could gather our children around us on dry land,\r\nwe knelt to offer thanks and praise for our merciful escape, and\r\nwith full hearts we commended ourselves to God's good keeping\r\nfor the time to come. All hands then briskly fell to the work\r\nof unloading, and, oh, how rich we felt ourselves as we did so!\r\n\r\nThe poultry we left at liberty to forage for themselves, and\r\nset about finding a suitable place to erect a tent in which to\r\npass the night. This we speedily did; thrusting a long spar\r\ninto a hole in the rock, and supporting the other end by a pole\r\nfirmly planted in the ground, we formed a framework over which\r\nwe stretched the sailcloth we had brought; besides fastening\r\nthis down with pegs, we placed our heavy chests and boxes on\r\nthe border of the canvas, and arranged hooks so as to be able\r\nto close up the entrance during the night.\r\n\r\nWhen this was accomplished, the boys ran to collect moss and\r\ngrass, to spread in the tent for our beds, while I arranged a\r\nfireplace, surrounded by large flat stones, near the brook which\r\nflowed close by. Dry twigs and seaweed were soon in a blaze on\r\nthe hearth, I filled the iron pot with water, and after I gave\r\nmy wife several cakes of the portable soup, she established\r\nherself as our cook, with little Franz to help her.\r\n\r\nHe, thinking his mother was melting some glue for carpentry,\r\nwas eager to know `what papa was going to make next?'\r\n\r\n`This is to be soup for your dinner, my child. Do you think\r\nthese cakes look like glue?'\r\n\r\n`Yes, indeed I do!' replied Franz, `And I should not much like\r\nto taste glue soup! Don't you want some beef or mutton, Mamma?'\r\n\r\n`Where can I get it, dear?' said she, `we are a long way from a\r\nbutcher's shop! But these cakes are made of the juice of good\r\nmeat, boiled till it becomes a strong stiff jelly--people take\r\nthem when they go to sea, because on a long voyage they can only\r\nhave salt meat, which will not make nice soup.'\r\n\r\nFritz, leaving a loaded gun with me, took another himself,* and\r\nwent along the rough coast to see what lay beyond the stream; this\r\nfatiguing sort of walk not suiting Ernest's fancy, he sauntered\r\ndown to the beach, and Jack scrambled among the rocks searching\r\nfor shellfish.\r\n\r\n   * Even today all adult male Swiss are required by law\r\n     to possess, and know how and when to use, firearms.\r\n     A father who did not teach his sons these things, as\r\n     well as firearms safety, would be very neglectful.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to land the two casks which were floating alongside\r\nour boat, but on attempting to do so, I found that I could not\r\nget them up the bank on which we had landed, and was therefore\r\nobliged to look for a more convenient spot. As I did so, I was\r\nstartled by hearing Jack shouting for help, as though in great\r\ndanger. He was at some distance, and I hurried towards him with\r\na hatchet in my hand.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow stood screaming in a deep pool, and as I\r\napproached, I saw that a huge lobster had caught his leg in its\r\npowerful claw. Poor Jack was in a terrible fright; kick as he\r\nwould, his enemy still clung on. I waded into the water, and\r\nseizing the lobster firmly by the back, managed to make it\r\nloosen its hold, and we brought it safe to land.\r\n\r\nJack, having speedily recovered his spirits, and anxious to take\r\nsuch a prize to his mother, caught the lobster in both hands, but\r\ninstantly received such a severe blow from its tail, that he flung\r\nit down, and passionately hit the creature with a large stone.\r\n\r\nThis display of temper vexed me. `You are acting in a very childish\r\nway, my son,' said I. `Never strike an enemy in a revengeful\r\nspirit, or when the enemy is unable to defend itself. The lobster,\r\nit is true, gave you a bite, but then you, on your part, intend\r\nto eat the lobster. So the game is at least equal. Next time,\r\nbe both more prudent and more merciful.'\r\n\r\nOnce more lifting the lobster, Jack ran triumphantly towards\r\nthe tent. `Mother, mother! A lobster! A lobster, Ernest! Look\r\nhere, Franz! Mind, he'll bite you! Where's Fritz?' All came\r\ncrowding round Jack and his prize, wondering at its unusual\r\nsize, and Ernest wanted his mother to make lobster soup directly,\r\nby adding it to what she was now boiling.\r\n\r\nShe, however, begged to decline making any such experiment, and\r\nsaid she preferred cooking one dish at a time. Having remarked\r\nthat the scene of Jack's adventure afforded a convenient place\r\nfor getting my casks on shore, I returned thither and succeeded\r\nin drawing them up on the beach, where I set them on end, and\r\nfor the present left them.\r\n\r\nOn my return I resumed the subject of Jack's lobster, and told\r\nhim he should have the offending claw all to himself when it was\r\nready to be eaten, congratulating him on being the first to\r\ndiscover anything useful.\r\n\r\n`As to that,' said Ernest, `I found something very good to eat,\r\nas well as Jack, only I could not get at them without wetting\r\nmy feet.'\r\n\r\n`Pooh!' cried Jack, `I know what he saw--nothing but some nasty\r\nmussels--I saw them too. Who wants to eat trash like that!\r\nLobster for me!'\r\n\r\n`I believe them to be oysters, not mussels,' returned Ernest\r\ncalmly. \"They were stuck to the rocks, so I am sure they are\r\noysters.\"\r\n\r\n`Be good enough, my philosophical young friend, to fetch a few\r\nspecimens of these oysters in time for our next meal,' said I.\r\n`We must all exert ourselves, Ernest, for the common good, and\r\npray never let me hear you object to wetting your feet. See how\r\nquickly the sun has dried Jack and me.'\r\n\r\n`I can bring some salt at the same time,' said Ernest, `I remarked\r\na good deal lying in the crevices of the rocks; it tasted very\r\npure and good, and I concluded it was produced by the evaporation\r\nof sea water in the sun.'\r\n\r\n`Extremely probable, learned sir,' cried I, `but if you had brought\r\na bag full of this good salt instead of merely speculating so\r\nprofoundly on the subject, it would have been more to the purpose.\r\nRun and fetch some directly.'\r\n\r\nIt proved to be salt sure enough, although so impure that it\r\nseemed useless, till my wife dissolved and strained it, when\r\nit became fit to put in the soup.\r\n\r\n`Why not use the sea-water itself?' asked Jack.\r\n\r\n`Because,' said Ernest, `it is not only salt, but bitter too.\r\nJust try it.'\r\n\r\n`Now,' said my wife, tasting the soup with the stick with which\r\nshe had been stirring it, `dinner is ready, but where can Fritz\r\nbe?' she continued, a little anxiously. `And how are we to eat\r\nour soup when he does come?' she continued. `We have neither\r\nplates nor spoons. Why did we not remember to bring some from\r\nthe ship?'\r\n\r\n\"Because, my dear, one cannot think of everything at once. We\r\nshall be fortunate if we do not find even more things we have\r\nforgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can scarcely lift the boiling pot to our mouths,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI was forced to agree. We all looked upon the pot with perplexity,\r\nrather like the fox in the fable, to whom the stork served up a\r\ndinner in a jug with a long neck. Silence was at length broken,\r\nwhen all of us burst into hearty laughter at our own folly in\r\nnot remembering that spoons and forks were things of absolute\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n`Oh, for a few cocoanut shells!' sighed Ernest.\r\n\r\n`Oh, for half a dozen plates and as many silver spoons!' rejoined\r\nI, smiling.\r\n\r\n`Really though, oyster-shells would do,' said he, after a\r\nmoment's thought.\r\n\r\n`True, that is an idea worth having! Off with you, my boys, get\r\nthe oysters and clean out a few shells. And none of you must\r\ncomplain because the spoons have no handles, and we grease our\r\nfingers a little in baling the soup out.'\r\n\r\nJack was away and up to his knees in the water in a moment\r\ndetaching the oysters. Ernest followed more leisurely, and still\r\nunwilling to wet his feet, stood by the margin of the pool and\r\ngathered in his handkerchief the oysters his brother threw him;\r\nas he thus stood he picked up and pocketed a large mussel shell\r\nfor his own use. As they returned with a good supply we heard a\r\nshout from Fritz in the distance; we returned it joyfully, and\r\nhe presently appeared before us, his hands behind his back, and\r\na look of disappointment upon his countenance.\r\n\r\n`Unsuccessful!' said he.\r\n\r\n`Really!' I replied. `Never mind, my boy, better luck next time.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, Fritz!' exclaimed his brothers who had looked behind him.\r\n`A sucking-pig, a little sucking-pig. Where did you get it? How\r\ndid you shoot it? Do let us see it!'\r\n\r\nFritz then with sparkling eyes exhibited his prize.\r\n\r\n`I am glad to see the result of your prowess, my boy,' said I;\r\n`but I cannot approve of deceit, even as a joke; stick to the\r\ntruth in jest and earnest.'\r\n\r\nFritz then told us how he had been to the other side of the stream.\r\n`So different from this,' he said, `it is really a beautiful\r\ncountry, and the shore, which runs down to the sea in a gentle\r\nslope, is covered with all sorts of useful things from the wreck.\r\nDo let us go and collect them. And, father, why should we not\r\nreturn to the wreck and bring off some of the animals? Just think\r\nof what value the cow would be to us, and what a pity it would be\r\nto lose her. Let us get her on shore, and we will move over the\r\nstream, where she will have good pasturage, and we shall be in\r\nthe shade instead of on this desert, and, father, I do wish--'\r\n\r\n`Stop, stop, my boy!' cried I. `All will be done in good time.\r\nTomorrow and the day after will bring work of their own. And tell\r\nme, did you see no traces of our shipmates?'\r\n\r\n`Not a sign of them, either on land or sea, living or dead,' he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n`But the sucking-pig,' said Jack, `where did you get it?'\r\n\r\n`It was one of several,' said Fritz, `which I found on the shore;\r\nalong with some very curious little animals that hopped rather\r\nthan walked, and every now and then would squat down on their hind\r\nlegs and rub their snouts with their forepaws. Had not I been\r\nafraid of losing all, I would have tried to catch one alive,\r\nthey seemed so tame. But this was more easily taken.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ernest had been carefully examining the animal\r\nin question.\r\n\r\n`This is no pig,' he said, `and except for its bristly skin,\r\ndoes not look like one. See, its teeth are not like those of a\r\npig, but rather those of a squirrel. In fact,' he continued,\r\nlooking at Fritz, `your sucking-pig is an agouti.'\r\n\r\n`Dear me,' said Fritz, `listen to the great professor lecturing!\r\nHe is going to prove that a pig is not a pig!'\r\n\r\n`You need not be so quick to laugh at your brother,' said I, in\r\nmy turn, `he is quite right. I, too, know the agouti by descriptions\r\nand pictures, and there is little doubt that this is a specimen.\r\nThe little animal makes its nest under the roots of trees, and\r\nlives upon fruit. Its meat is white but dry, having no fat, and never\r\nentirely loses a certain wild flavour, which is disagreeable\r\nto Europeans. It is held in great esteem by the natives where\r\nit lives, especially when the animal has been feeding near the\r\nsea on plants impregnated with salt. But, Ernest, the agouti\r\nnot only looks something like a pig, but most decidedly grunts\r\nlike a porker.'\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus talking, Jack had been vainly endeavouring to\r\nopen an oyster with his large knife. `Here is a simpler way,' said\r\nI, placing an oyster on the fire; it immediately opened.\r\n\r\n`Now,' I continued, `who will try this delicacy?' All at first\r\nhesitated to partake of them, so unattractive did they appear.\r\nJack, however, tightly closing his eyes and making a face as\r\nthough about to take medicine, gulped one down. We followed his\r\nexample, one after the other, each doing so rather to provide\r\nhimself with a spoon than with any hope of cultivating a taste\r\nfor oysters.\r\n\r\nOur spoons were now ready, and gathering round the pot we dipped\r\nthem in, not, however, without sundry scalded fingers. Ernest\r\nthen drew from his pocket the large shell he had procured for\r\nhis own use, and scooping up a good quantity of soup he put it\r\ndown to cool, smiling at his own foresight.\r\n\r\n`Prudence should be exercised for others, not just for oneself,'\r\nI remarked. `Are you so much better than your brothers? Your cool\r\nsoup will do capitally for the dogs, my boy; take it to them, and\r\nthen come and eat like the rest of us.'\r\n\r\nErnest winced at this, but silently taking up his shell he placed\r\nit on the ground before the hungry dogs, who lapped up its contents\r\nin a moment; he then returned, and after waiting for the soup to\r\ncool some more, we all went merrily on with our dinner.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus busily employed, we suddenly discovered that\r\nour dogs, not satisfied with their mouthful of soup, had espied\r\nthe agouti, and were rapidly devouring it. The boys all began to\r\nyell, and Fritz first threw a stone at the dogs and then, seizing\r\nhis gun, flew to rescue it from their hungry jaws. Before I could\r\nprevent him, he struck one of them with such force that his gun\r\nwas bent. The poor beasts ran off howling, followed by a shower of\r\nstones from Fritz, who shouted and yelled at them so fiercely,\r\nthat if I had not interfered, it was probable he would have\r\nkilled them.\r\n\r\nI followed him, and as soon as he would listen to me, represented\r\nto him how despicable as well as wicked was such an outbreak of\r\ntemper. `For,' said I, `you have hurt, if not actually wounded,\r\nthe dogs; you have distressed and frightened your mother, and\r\nyou have spoiled your gun, which would have been so useful.'\r\n\r\nThough Fritz's passion was easily aroused it never lasted long,\r\nand speedily recovering himself, immediately he entreated his\r\nmother's pardon, and expressed his sorrow for his fault.\r\n\r\nBy this time the sun was sinking beneath the horizon, and the\r\npoultry, which had been straying to some little distance, gathered\r\nround us, and began to pick up the crumbs of biscuit which had\r\nfallen during our repast. My wife hereupon drew from her mysterious\r\nbag some handfuls of oats, peas, and other grain, and with them\r\nbegan to feed the poultry.\r\n\r\nShe at the same time showed me several other seeds of various\r\nvegetables. `That was indeed thoughtful,' said I, `but pray be\r\ncareful of what will be of such value to us; we can bring plenty\r\nof damaged biscuits from the wreck, which though of no use as\r\nfood for us, will suit the fowls very well indeed.'\r\n\r\nThe pigeons now flew up to crevices in the rocks, the fowls\r\nperched themselves on our tent pole, and the ducks and geese\r\nwaddled off cackling and quacking to the marshy margin of the\r\nriver. We too were ready for repose, and having loaded our guns,\r\nand offered up our prayers to God, thanking him for his many\r\nmercies to us, we commended ourselves to his protecting care,\r\nand as the last ray of light departed, closed our tent and lay\r\ndown to rest.\r\n\r\nThe children remarked the suddenness of nightfall, for indeed\r\nthere had been little or no twilight. This convinced me that we\r\nmust be not far from the equator, for twilight results from the\r\nrefraction of the sun's rays; the more obliquely these rays fall,\r\nthe further does the partial light extend, while the more\r\nperpendicularly they strike the earth the longer do they continue\r\ntheir undiminished force, until when the sun sinks, they totally\r\ndisappear, thus producing sudden darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nWe should have been badly off without the shelter of our tent,\r\nfor the night proved as cold as the day had been hot, but we\r\nmanaged to sleep comfortably, every one being thoroughly fatigued\r\nby the labours of the day.\r\n\r\nThe voice of our vigilant cock, which as he loudly saluted the\r\nrising moon, was the last sound I heard at night, roused me at\r\ndaybreak, and I then awoke my wife, that in the quiet interval\r\nwhile yet our children slept, we might take counsel together on\r\nour situation and prospects. It was plain to both of us that in\r\nthe first place, we should ascertain if possible the fate of our\r\nlate companions, and then examine into the nature and resources\r\nof the country on which we were stranded.\r\n\r\nWe therefore came to the resolution that, as soon as we had\r\nbreakfasted, Fritz and I should start on an expedition with\r\nthese objects in view, while my wife remained near our landing-\r\nplace with the three younger boys.\r\n\r\n`Rouse up, rouse up, my boys,' cried I, awakening the children\r\ncheerfully. `Come and help your mother to get breakfast ready.'\r\n\r\n`As to that,' said she, smiling, `we can but set on the pot, and\r\nboil some more soup!'\r\n\r\n`Why! You forget Jack's fine lobster!' replied I. `What has become\r\nof it, Jack?'\r\n\r\n`It has been safe in this hole in the rock all night, father. You\r\nsee, I thought as the dogs seem to like good things, they might\r\ntake a fancy to that as well as to the agouti.'\r\n\r\n`A very sensible precaution,' remarked I. `I believe even my\r\nheedless Jack will learn wisdom in time. It is well the lobster\r\nis so large, for we shall want to take part with us on our excursion\r\nto-day.'\r\n\r\nAt the mention of an excursion, the four children were wild with\r\ndelight, and, capering around me, clapped their hands for joy.\r\n\r\n`Steady there, steady!' said I, `you cannot expect all to go.\r\nSuch an expedition as this would be too dangerous and fatiguing\r\nfor you younger ones, and this place seems perfectly safe. Fritz\r\nand I will go alone this time, with one of the dogs, leaving the\r\nother to defend you. Fritz, prepare the guns, and tie up Flora\r\nso that she will not follow us.'\r\n\r\nAt the word `guns' the poor boy blushed shamefully. He tried in\r\nvain to straighten his weapon. I left him alone for a short time,\r\nbut at length I gave him leave to take another, perceiving with\r\npleasure that the vexation had produced a proper feeling in his mind.\r\n\r\nA moment later he tried to lay hold of Flora to tie her up, but\r\nthe dog, recollecting the blows she had so lately received, began\r\nto snarl and would not go near him. Turk behaved the same, and I\r\nfound it necessary to call with my own voice to induce them to\r\napproach us. Fritz then, in tears, entreated some biscuit of his\r\nmother, declaring that he would rather go without the rest of his\r\nbreakfast to make his peace with the dogs. He accordingly carried\r\nthem some biscuit, stroked and caressed them, and in every motion\r\nseemed to ask their pardon. As of all animals, without excepting\r\nman, the dog is least addicted to revenge, and at the same time\r\nis the most sensible of kind usage, Flora instantly relented and\r\nbegan to lick the hands which fed her; but Turk, who was of a\r\nmore fierce and independent temper, still held off, and seemed\r\nto lack confidence in Fritz's advances.\r\n\r\n`Give him a claw of my lobster,' cried Jack, `for I meant to\r\ngive it to you anyway, for your journey.'\r\n\r\nWith that treat, Turk seemed ready to forgive Fritz. We then armed\r\nourselves, each taking a gun and a game-bag; Fritz, in addition,\r\nsticking a pair of pistols in his belt, and I a small hatchet in\r\nmine; breakfast being over, we stowed away the remainder of the\r\nlobster and some biscuits, with a flask of water, and were ready\r\nfor a start.\r\n\r\n`Stop!' I exclaimed, `we have still left something very\r\nimportant undone.'\r\n\r\n`Surely not,' said Fritz.\r\n\r\n`Yes,' said I, `we have not yet joined in morning prayer. We are\r\nonly too ready, amid the cares and pleasures of this life, to\r\nforget the God to whom we owe all things.' Then having commended\r\nourselves to his protecting care, I took leave of my wife and\r\nchildren, and bidding them not wander far from the boat and tent,\r\nwe parted not without some anxiety on either side, for we knew\r\nnot what might assail us in this unknown region.\r\n\r\nWe now found that the banks of the stream were on both sides so\r\nrocky that we could get down to the water by only one narrow\r\npassage, and there was no corresponding path on the other side.\r\nI was glad to see this, however, for I now knew that my wife\r\nand children were on a comparatively inaccessible spot, the other\r\nside of the tent being protected by steep and precipitous cliffs.\r\n\r\nFritz and I pursued our way up the stream until we reached a point\r\nwhere the waters fell from a considerable height in a cascade, and\r\nwhere several large rocks lay half covered by the water; by means\r\nof these we succeeded in crossing the stream in safety. We thus\r\nhad the sea on our left, and a long line of rocky heights, here\r\nand there adorned with clumps of trees, stretching away inland\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\nWe had forced our way scarcely fifty yards through the long rank\r\ngrass, which was here partly withered by the sun and much tangled,\r\nwhen we were much alarmed on hearing behind us a rustling, and on\r\nlooking round, we saw the grass waving to and fro, as if some\r\nanimal were passing through it. Fritz instantly turned and brought\r\nhis gun to his shoulder, ready to fire the moment the beast\r\nshould appear.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with my son's coolness and presence of mind,\r\nfor it showed me that I might thoroughly rely upon him on any\r\nfuture occasion when real danger might occur. This time, however,\r\nno savage beast rushed out, but our trusty dog Turk, whom, in\r\nour anxiety at parting, we had forgotten, and who had been sent\r\nafter us doubtless by my thoughtful wife. I did not fail to\r\ncommend both the bravery and the discretion of my son, in not\r\nyielding to even a rational alarm, and for waiting until he was\r\nsure of the object before he resolved to fire.\r\n\r\nFrom this little incident, however, we saw how dangerous was our\r\nposition, and how difficult escape would be should any fierce\r\nbeast steal upon us unawares: we therefore hastened to make our\r\nway to the open seashore. Here the scene which presented itself\r\nwas indeed delightful. A background of hills, the green waving\r\ngrass, the pleasant groups of trees stretching here and there\r\nto the very water's edge, formed a lovely prospect.\r\n\r\nOn the smooth sand we searched carefully for any trace of our\r\nhapless companions, but not the mark of a footstep could we find.\r\n`Shall I fire a shot or two?' said Fritz. `That would bring our\r\ncompanions, if they are within hearing.'\r\n\r\n`It would indeed,' I replied, `or any savages that may be here.\r\nNo, no; let us search diligently, but as quietly as possible.'\r\n\r\n`But why, father, should we trouble ourselves about them at all?\r\nThey left us to shift for ourselves, and I for one don't care to\r\nset eyes on them again.'\r\n\r\n`You are wrong, my boy,' said I. `In the first place, we should\r\nnot return evil for evil; then, again, they might be of great\r\nassistance to us in building a house of some sort; and lastly,\r\nyou must remember that they took nothing with them from the\r\nvessel, and may be perishing of hunger.'\r\n\r\n`But father, while we are wandering here and losing our time\r\nalmost without a hope of benefit to them, why should we not\r\ninstead return to the vessel and save the animals on board?'\r\n\r\n`When a variety of duties present themselves for our choice,\r\nwe should always give the preference to that which can confer\r\nthe most solid advantage,' I replied. `The saving of the life\r\nof a man is a more exalted action than contributing to the\r\ncomfort of a few quadrupeds, whom we have already supplied with\r\nfood for a few days. Also, the sea is so calm at present that we\r\nneed not fear that the ship will sink or break up entirely before\r\nwe can return.'\r\n\r\nThus talking, we pushed on until we came to a pleasant grove\r\nwhich stretched down to the water's edge; here we halted to\r\nrest, seating ourselves under a large tree, by a rivulet which\r\nmurmured and splashed along its pebbly bed into the great\r\nocean before us.\r\n\r\nA thousand gaily plumaged birds flew twittering above us, and\r\nFritz and I gazed up at them. My son suddenly started up. `A\r\nmonkey,' he exclaimed, `I am nearly sure I saw a monkey.'\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he sprang round to the other side of the tree, and\r\nin doing so stumbled over a small round object which he handed\r\nto me, remarking, as he did so, that it was a round bird's nest,\r\nof which he had often heard.\r\n\r\n`You may have done so,' said I, laughing, `but you need not\r\nnecessarily conclude that every round hairy thing is a bird's\r\nnest; this, for instance, is not one, but a cocoanut. Do you not\r\nremember reading that a cocoanut is enclosed within a round,\r\nfibrous covering over a hard shell, which again is surrounded\r\nby a bulky green hull? In the one you hold in your hand, the\r\nouter hull has been destroyed by time, which is the reason that\r\nthe twisted fibers of the inner covering are so apparent. Let\r\nus now break the shell, and you will see the nut inside.'\r\n\r\nNot without difficulty, we split open the nut, but, to our\r\ndisgust, found the kernel dry and uneatable.\r\n\r\n`Hullo,' cried Fritz, `I always thought a cocoanut was full\r\nof delicious sweet liquid, like almond milk.'\r\n\r\n`So it is,' I replied, `when young and fresh, but as it ripens\r\nthe milk becomes congealed, and in course of time is solidified\r\ninto a kernel. This kernel then dries as you see here, but when\r\nthe nut falls on favourable soil, the germ within the kernel\r\nswells until it bursts through the shell, and, taking root, springs\r\nup a new tree.'\r\n\r\n`I do not understand,' said Fritz, `how the little germ manages\r\nto get through this great thick shell, which is not like an almond\r\nor hazel-nut shell, that is divided down the middle already.'\r\n\r\n`Nature provides for all things,' I answered, taking up the\r\npieces. `Look here, do you see these three round holes near the\r\nstalk; it is through them that the germ obtains egress. Now let\r\nus find a good nut if we can.'\r\n\r\nAs cocoanuts must be over-ripe before they fall naturally from\r\nthe tree, it was not without difficulty that we obtained one in\r\nwhich the kernel was not dried up. It was a little oily and\r\nrancid, but this was not the time to be too particular. We were\r\nso refreshed by the fruit that we could defer the repast we\r\ncalled our dinner* until later in the day, and so spare our stock\r\nof provisions.\r\n\r\n    * In this book, 'dinner' refers to the midday meal.\r\n\r\nContinuing our way through a thicket, which was so densely\r\novergrown with lianas that we had to clear a passage with our\r\nhatchets, we again emerged on the seashore beyond, and found an\r\nopen view, the forest sweeping inland, while on the space before\r\nus stood at intervals single trees of remarkable appearance.\r\nThese at once attracted Fritz's observant eye, and he pointed\r\nto them, exclaiming: `Oh, what absurd-looking trees, father!\r\nSee what strange bumps there are on the trunks.'\r\n\r\nWe approached to examine them, and I recognized them as calabash\r\ntrees, the fruit of which grows in this curious way on the stems,\r\nand is a species of gourd, from the hard rind of which bowls,\r\nspoons, and bottles can be made. `The savages,' I remarked, `are\r\nsaid to form these things most ingeniously, using them to contain\r\nliquids: indeed, they actually cook food in them.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, but that is impossible,' returned Fritz. `I am quite sure\r\nthis rind would be burnt through directly if it was set on the fire.'\r\n\r\n`I did not say it was set on the fire at all. When the gourd has\r\nbeen divided in two, and the shell or rind emptied of its contents,\r\nit is filled with water, into which the fish, or whatever is to\r\nbe cooked, is put; red-hot stones are added until the water boils;\r\nthe food becomes fit to eat, and the gourd-rind remains uninjured.'\r\n\r\n`That is a very clever plan: very simple too. I daresay I should\r\nhave hit on it, if I had tried,' said Fritz.\r\n\r\n`The friends of Columbus thought it very easy to make an egg\r\nstand upon its end when he had shown them how to do it. But now\r\nsuppose we prepare some of these calabashes, that they may be\r\nready for use when we take them home.'\r\n\r\nFritz instantly took up one of the gourds, and tried to split it\r\nequally with his knife, but in vain: the blade slipped, and the\r\ncalabash was cut jaggedly. `What a nuisance!' said Fritz, flinging\r\nit down, `The thing is spoiled; and yet it seemed so simple to\r\ndivide it properly.'\r\n\r\n`Stay,' said I, `you are too impatient, those pieces are not\r\nuseless. Do you try to fashion from them a spoon or two while\r\nI provide a dish.' I then took from my pocket a piece of string,\r\nwhich I tied tightly round a gourd, as near one end of it as I\r\ncould; then tapping the string with the back of my knife, it\r\npenetrated the outer shell. When this was accomplished, I tied\r\nthe string yet tighter; and drawing the ends with all my might,\r\nthe gourd fell, divided exactly as I wished.\r\n\r\n`That is clever!' cried Fritz. `What in the world put that plan\r\ninto your head?'\r\n\r\n`It is a plan,' I replied, `which savages adopt, as I have learned\r\nfrom reading books of travel.'\r\n\r\n`Well, it certainly makes a capital soup-tureen, and a soup-plate\r\ntoo,' said Fritz, examining the gourd. `But supposing you had\r\nwanted to make a bottle, how would you have set to work?'\r\n\r\n`It would be an easier operation than this, if possible. All that\r\nis necessary, is to cut a round hole at one end, then to scoop\r\nout the interior, and to drop in several shot or stones; when\r\nthese are shaken, any remaining portions of the fruit are detached,\r\nand the gourd is thoroughly cleaned, and the bottle completed.'\r\n\r\n`That would not make a very convenient bottle though, father; it\r\nwould be more like a barrel.'\r\n\r\n`True, my boy; if you want a more shapely vessel, you must take\r\nit in hand when it is younger. To give it a neck, for instance,\r\nyou must tie a bandage round the young gourd while it is still\r\non the tree, and then all will swell but that part which you have\r\nchecked.' As I spoke, I filled the gourds with sand, and left\r\nthem to dry; marking the spot that we might return for them on\r\nour way back.\r\n\r\n`Are the bottle-shaped gourds I have seen in Europe trained\r\nsimilarly?'\r\n\r\n`No, they are of another species, and what you have seen is\r\ntheir natural shape.'\r\n\r\nFor three hours or more we pushed forward, keeping a sharp\r\nlook-out on either side for any trace of our companions, till we\r\nreached a bold promontory, stretching some way into the sea, from\r\nwhose rocky summit I knew that we should obtain a good and\r\ncomprehensive view of the surrounding country. With little\r\ndifficulty we reached the top, but the most careful survey of\r\nthe beautiful landscape failed to show us the slightest sign or\r\ntrace of human beings.\r\n\r\nBefore us stretched a wide and lovely bay, fringed with yellow\r\nsands, either side extending into the distance, and almost lost\r\nto view in two shadowy promontories; enclosed by these two arms\r\nlay a sheet of rippling water, which reflected in its depths the\r\nglorious sun above. The scene inland was no less beautiful; and\r\nyet Fritz and I both felt a shade of loneliness stealing over us\r\nas we gazed on its utter solitude.\r\n\r\n`Cheer up, Fritz, my boy,' said I, presently. `Remember that we\r\nchose a settler's life long ago, before we left our own dear\r\ncountry; we certainly did not expect to be so entirely alone--but\r\nwhat matters a few people, more or less? With God's help, let us\r\nendeavour to live here contentedly, thankful that we were not cast\r\nupon some bare and inhospitable island. But come, the heat here\r\nis getting unbearable; let us find some shady place before we are\r\ncompletely broiled away.'\r\n\r\nWe descended the hill and made for a clump of palm trees, which we\r\nsaw at a little distance. To reach this, we had to pass through a\r\ndense thicket of reeds, no pleasant or easy task; for, besides the\r\ndifficulty of forcing our way through, I feared at every step that\r\nwe might tread on some venomous snake.\r\n\r\nSending Turk in advance, I cut one of the reeds, thinking it would\r\nbe a more useful weapon against a reptile than my gun. I had\r\ncarried it but a little way, when I noticed a thick juice exuding\r\nfrom one end. I tasted it, and to my delight, found it sweet and\r\npleasant. I at once knew that I was standing amongst sugar-canes.\r\n\r\nWishing Fritz to make the same discovery, I advised him to cut a\r\ncane for his defense; he did so, and as he beat the ground before\r\nhim, the reed split, and his hand was covered with the juice. He\r\ncarefully touched the cane with the tip of his tongue, then,\r\nfinding the juice sweet, he did so again with less hesitation;\r\nand a moment afterwards sprang back to me, exclaiming, `Oh, father,\r\nsugar-cane, sugar-cane! Taste it. Oh, how delicious, how\r\ndelightful! Do let us take a lot home to mother,' he continued,\r\nsucking eagerly at the cane!\r\n\r\n`Gently there,' said I, `take breath a moment, moderation in\r\nall things, remember. Cut some to take home if you like; only\r\ndon't take more than you can conveniently carry.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of my warning, my son cut a dozen or more of the largest\r\ncanes, and stripping them of their leaves, carried them under his\r\narm. We then pushed through the cane-brake, and reached the clump\r\nof palms for which we had been making; as we entered it a troop of\r\nmonkeys, who had been disporting themselves on the ground, sprang\r\nup, chattering and grimacing, and before we could clearly\r\ndistinguish them, were at the very top of the trees.\r\n\r\nFritz was so provoked by their impertinent gestures that he raised\r\nhis gun, and would have shot one of the poor beasts. `Stay,' cried\r\nI, `never take the life of any animal needlessly. A live monkey\r\nup in that tree is of more use to us than a dozen dead ones at\r\nour feet, as I will show you.'\r\n\r\nSaying this, I gathered a handful of small stones, and threw them\r\nup towards the apes. The stones did not go near them, but influenced\r\nby their instinctive mania for imitation, they instantly seized\r\nall the cocoanuts within their reach, and sent a perfect hail of\r\nthem down upon us.\r\n\r\nFritz was delighted with my stratagem, and rushing forward picked\r\nup some of the finest of the nuts. We drank the milk they contained,\r\ndrawing it through the holes which I pierced. The milk of a\r\ncocoanut has not a pleasant flavor, but it is excellent for quenching\r\nthirst. What we liked best was a kind of solid cream which adheres\r\nto their shells, and which we scraped off with our spoons.\r\n\r\nAfter this delicious meal, we thoroughly despised the lobster we\r\nhad been carrying, and threw it to Turk, who ate it gratefully;\r\nbut far from being satisfied, the poor beast began to gnaw the\r\nends of the sugar-canes, and to beg for cocoanut. I slung a couple\r\nof the nuts over my shoulder, fastening them together by their\r\nstalks, and Fritz having resumed his burden, we began our homeward\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nI soon discovered that Fritz found the weight of his canes\r\nconsiderably more than he expected: he shifted them from shoulder\r\nto shoulder, then for a while carried them under his arm, and\r\nfinally stopped short with a sigh. `I had no idea,' he said,\r\n`that a few reeds would be so heavy. How sincerely I pity the\r\npoor negroes who are made to carry heavy loads of them! Yet how\r\nglad I shall be when my mother and brothers are tasting them.'\r\n\r\n`Never mind, my boy,' I said, `Patience and courage! Do you not\r\nremember the story of Aesop and his breadbasket, how heavy he\r\nfound it when he started, and how light at the end of his journey?\r\n Let us each take a fresh staff, and then fasten the bundle\r\ncrosswise with your gun.'\r\n\r\nWe did so, and once more stepped forward. Fritz presently noticed\r\nthat I from time to time sucked the end of my cane.\r\n\r\n`Oh, come,' said he, `that's a capital plan of yours, father,\r\nI'll do that too.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he began to suck most vigorously, but not a drop of\r\nthe juice could he extract. `How is this?' he asked. `How do you\r\nget the juice out, father?'\r\n\r\n`Think a little,' I replied, `you are quite as capable as I am of\r\nfinding out the way, even if you do not know the real reason of\r\nyour failure.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, of course,' said he, `it is like trying to suck marrow from\r\na marrow bone, without making a hole at the other end.'\r\n\r\n`Quite right,' I said, `you form a vacuum in your mouth and the\r\nend of your tube, and expect the air to force down the liquid\r\nfrom the other end which it cannot possibly enter.'\r\n\r\nFritz was speedily perfect in the accomplishment of sucking\r\nsugar-cane, discovering by experience the necessity for a fresh\r\ncut at each joint or knot in the cane, through which the juice\r\ncould not flow; he talked of the pleasure of initiating his\r\nbrothers in the art, and of how Ernest would enjoy the cocoanut\r\nmilk, with which he had filled his flask.*\r\n\r\n   * M. Wyss's acquaintance with sugar has not extended\r\n     to the sugar cane. The sap does not flow; it is\r\n     embedded in the very fibrous pulp, and the cane\r\n     must be crushed, and its juice cooked and repeatedly\r\n     refined, to make the sugar. People enjoying the\r\n     cane in its natural state must chew the pulp,\r\n     which is not particularly sweet.\r\n\r\n`My dear boy,' said I, `you need not have added that to your load;\r\nthe chances are it will be vinegar by the time we get home. In\r\nthe heat of the sun, it will ferment soon after being drawn\r\nfrom the nut.'\r\n\r\n`Vinegar! Oh, that would be a horrid bore! I must look directly,\r\nand see how it is getting on,' cried Fritz, hastily swinging\r\nthe flask from his shoulder, and tugging out the cork. With a\r\nloud `pop' the contents came forth, foaming like champagne.\r\n\r\n`There now!' said I, laughing as he tasted this new luxury.\r\n`You will have to exercise moderation again, friend Fritz!\r\nI daresay it is delicious, but it will go to your head, if\r\nyou venture deep into your flask.'\r\n\r\n`My dear father, you cannot think how good it is! Do take some.\r\nVinegar, indeed! This is like excellent wine.'\r\n\r\nWe were both invigorated by this unexpected draught, and went on\r\nso merrily after it, that the distance to the place where we had\r\nleft our gourd dishes seemed less than we expected. We found\r\nthem quite dry, and very light and easy to carry.\r\n\r\nJust as we had passed through the grove in which we breakfasted,\r\nTurk suddenly darted away from us, and sprang furiously among a\r\ntroop of monkeys, which were gambolling playfully on the turf at\r\na little distance from the trees. They were taken by surprise\r\ncompletely, and the dog, now really ravenous from hunger, had\r\nseized one, and was fiercely tearing it to pieces before we could\r\napproach the spot.\r\n\r\nHis luckless victim was the mother of a tiny little monkey,\r\nwhich, being on her back when the dog flew at her, had hindered\r\nher flight; the little creature attempted to hide among the\r\ngrass, and in trembling fear watched the tragic fate of its\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving Turk's bloodthirsty design, Fritz had eagerly rushed\r\nto the rescue, flinging away all he was carrying, and losing his\r\nhat in his haste. All to no purpose as far as the poor mother ape\r\nwas concerned, and a laughable scene ensued, for no sooner did the\r\nyoung monkey catch sight of him than at one bound it was on his\r\nshoulders, and, holding fast by his thick curly hair, it firmly\r\nkept its seat in spite of all he could do to dislodge it. He\r\nscreamed and plunged about as he endeavoured to shake or pull\r\nthe creature off, but all in vain, it only clung the closer to\r\nhis neck, making the most absurd grimaces.\r\n\r\nI laughed so much at this ridiculous scene, that I could scarcely\r\nassist my terrified boy out of his awkward predicament. Indeed, I\r\ntold Fritz that the animal, having lost its mother, seemed\r\ndetermined to adopt Fritz. \"Perhaps he has discovered in you\r\nsomething of the air of a father of a family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or rather,\" Fritz retorted, \"the little rogue has found out that\r\nhe has to do with a chicken-heart, who shrinks from the idea of\r\nill-treating an animal which has thrown itself on his protection.\r\nBut father, he is yanking my hair terribly, and I shall be\r\nobliged to you to try once more to get him off.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, by coaxing the monkey, offering it a bit of biscuit,\r\nand gradually disentangling its small sinewy paws from the curls\r\nit grasped so tightly, I managed to relieve poor Fritz, who then\r\nlooked with interest at the baby ape, no bigger than a kitten,\r\nas it lay in my arms.\r\n\r\n`What a jolly little fellow it is!' exclaimed he. `Do let me try\r\nto rear it, father. I daresay cocoanut milk would do until we can\r\nbring the cow and the goats from the wreck. If he lives he might\r\nbe useful to us. I believe monkeys instinctively know what fruits\r\nare wholesome and what are poisonous.'\r\n\r\n`Well,' said I, `let the little orphan be yours. You bravely and\r\nkindly exerted yourself to save the mother's life, now you must\r\ntrain her child carefully, for unless you do so its natural\r\ninstinct will prove mischievous instead of useful to us.'\r\n\r\nTurk was meanwhile devouring with great satisfaction the little\r\nanimal's unfortunate mother. Fritz wished to drive him away from\r\nthe feast, but I could not grudge it him, and reminded Fritz that\r\ncontinued hunger might have made Turk dangerous to ourselves. We\r\ndid not think it necessary to wait until he had dined, so we\r\nprepared to resume our march, conversing as we walked.\r\n\r\n\"Let me remind you,\" I said, \"in our situation, it would be\r\ndangerous to teach the dogs not to attack and kill, if they can,\r\nwhatever unknown animals they meet. You will see that he will\r\nsoon regard your little monkey as a member of our family. But\r\nwe must not discourage him from his fancy for attacking wild\r\nbeasts. Heaven has bestowed the dog on man to be his safeguard\r\nand ally, and the horse the same. A man on horseback, accompanied\r\nby a troop of well-trained dogs, need not fear any species of\r\nwild beasts, not even the lion nor the hyaena.\"\r\n\r\nThoughtfully, Fritz replied, \"I feel fortunate that we are in the\r\npossession of two such creatures; but what a pity that the horses\r\non board died during our voyage, and left us with only an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us take care how we treat even our ass with disdain,\" I told\r\nhim. \"I wish we had him safe on land. Fortunately he is large and\r\nstrong. We may train him to do us the same services as are\r\nperformed by the horse; and it is not improbable that he will\r\nimprove under our care, given the excellent pasture we will find\r\n in this climate.\"\r\n\r\nThe tiny ape seated itself in the coolest way imaginable on\r\nFritz's shoulder, I helped to carry his canes, and we were\r\non some distance before Turk overtook us, looking uncommonly\r\nwell pleased, and licking his chops as though recalling the\r\nmemory of his feast.\r\n\r\nHe took no notice of the monkey, but it was very uneasy at\r\nsight of him, and scrambled down into Fritz's arms, which was\r\nso inconvenient to him that he devised a plan to relieve himself\r\nof his burden.\r\n\r\nCalling Turk, and seriously enjoining obedience, he seated the\r\nmonkey on his back, securing it there with a cord, and then\r\nputting a second string round the dog's neck that he might lead\r\nhim, he put a loop of the knot into the comical rider's hand,\r\nsaying gravely, `Having slain the parent, Mr. Turk, you will\r\nplease to carry the son.'\r\n\r\nAt first this arrangement mightily displeased them both, but by\r\nand by they yielded to it quietly; the monkey especially amused\r\nus by riding along with the air of a person perfectly at his ease.\r\n\r\n`We look just like a couple of mountebanks on their way to a fair\r\nwith animals to exhibit,' said I. `What an outcry the children\r\nwill make when we appear!'\r\n\r\nMy son inquired to what species of the monkey tribe I thought\r\nhis protege belonged, which led to a good deal of talk on the\r\nsubject, and conversation beguiling the way, we found ourselves\r\nere long on the rocky margin of the stream and close to the rest\r\nof our party.\r\n\r\nJuno was the first to be aware of our approach, and gave notice\r\nof it by loud barking, to which Turk replied with such hearty\r\ngoodwill, that his little rider, terrified at the noise his\r\nsteed was making, slipped from under the cord and fled to his\r\nrefuge on Fritz's shoulder, where he regained his composure and\r\nsettled himself comfortably.\r\n\r\nTurk, who by this time knew where he was, finding himself free,\r\ndashed forward to rejoin his friend, and announce our coming. One\r\nafter another our dear ones came running to the opposite bank,\r\ntestifying in various ways their delight at our return, and\r\nhastening up on their side of the river, as we on ours, to the\r\nford at which we had crossed in the morning. We were quickly on\r\nthe other side, and, full of joy and affection, our happy party\r\nwas once more united.\r\n\r\nThe boys suddenly perceiving the little animal which was clinging\r\nclose to their brother, in alarm at the tumult of voices, shouted\r\nin ecstasy:\r\n\r\n`A monkey! A monkey! Oh, how splendid! Where did Fritz find him?\r\nWhat may we give him to eat? Oh, what a bundle of sticks! Look at\r\nthose curious great nuts father has got!'\r\n\r\nWe could neither check this confused torrent of questions, nor\r\nget in a word in answer to them.\r\n\r\nAt length when the excitement subsided a little, I was able to\r\nsay a few words with a chance of being listened to. `I am truly\r\nthankful to see you all safe and well, and, thank God, our\r\nexpedition has been very satisfactory, except that we have\r\nentirely failed to discover any trace of our shipmates.'\r\n\r\n`If it be the will of God,' said my wife, `to leave us alone on\r\nthis solitary place, let us be content, and rejoice that we are\r\nall together in safety. I have been uneasy since you left, and\r\nimagined a thousand evils that might beset you. The day appeared\r\nan age, but now that I see you once more safe and well, I know\r\nhow foolish my fears must seem.\r\n\r\n`Now we want to hear all your adventures, and let us relieve you\r\nof your burdens,' added she, taking my game-bag.\r\n\r\nJack shouldered my gun, Ernest took the cocoanuts, and little\r\nFranz carried the gourds, Fritz distributed the sugarcanes amongst\r\nhis brothers, and handing Ernest his gun replaced the monkey on\r\nTurk's back. Ernest soon found the burden with which Fritz had\r\nladen him too heavy to his taste. His mother, perceiving this,\r\noffered to relieve him of part of the load. He willingly gave up\r\nthe cocoanuts, but no sooner had he done so than his elder brother\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n`Hullo, Ernest, you surely do not know what you are parting with;\r\ndid you really intend to hand over those good cocoanuts without\r\nso much as tasting them?'\r\n\r\n`What? ho! Are they really cocoanuts?' cried Ernest, `I thought\r\nthey were bowls! Do let me take them again, mother, do let me\r\nlook at them.'\r\n\r\n`No, thank you,' replied my wife with a smile. `I have no wish to\r\nsee you again overburdened.'\r\n\r\n`Oh but I have only to throw away these sticks, which are of no\r\nuse, and then I can easily carry them.'\r\n\r\n`Worse and worse,' said Fritz, `I have a particular regard for\r\nthose heavy useless sticks. Did you ever hear of sugar-canes?'\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when Ernest began to\r\nsuck vigorously at the end of the cane with no better result,\r\nhowever, than Fritz had obtained as we were on the march.\r\n\r\n`Here,' said Fritz, `let me show you the trick of it,' and he\r\nspeedily set all the youngsters to work extracting the luscious\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nMy wife, as a prudent housekeeper who made much use of sugar,\r\nwas no less delighted than the children with this discovery; the\r\nsight of the dishes also pleased her greatly, for she longed to\r\nsee us eat once more like civilized beings.\r\n\r\nWe went into the kitchen and there found preparations for a truly\r\nsumptuous meal. Two forked sticks were planted in the ground on\r\neither side of the fire, on these rested a rod from which hung\r\nseveral tempting-looking fish, opposite them hung a goose from a\r\nsimilar contrivance, slowly roasting while the gravy dropped into\r\na large shell placed beneath it. Franz gave the spit another turn,\r\nassuring me he had been helping all day to keep the meal from\r\nburning. In the centre sat the great pot from which issued the\r\nsmell of a most delicious soup. To crown this splendid array,\r\nstood an open hogshead full of Dutch cheeses.\r\n\r\nAll this was very pleasant to two hungry travellers, but I was\r\nabout to beg my wife to spare the poultry until our stock should\r\nhave increased, when she, perceiving my thought, quickly relieved\r\nmy anxiety. `This is not one of our geese,' she said, `but a wild\r\nbird Ernest killed.'\r\n\r\n`Yes,' said Ernest, `it is a penguin, I think, it let me get quite\r\nclose, so that I knocked it on the head with a stick. Here are its\r\nhead and feet which I preserved to show you; the bill is, you see,\r\nnarrow and curved downwards, and the feet are webbed. It had funny\r\nlittle bits of useless wings, and its eyes looked so solemnly and\r\nsedately at me, that I was almost ashamed to kill it. It seemed\r\nquite destitute of any intelligence, so that I was able to kill\r\nit with a single blow from my stick. Do you not think it must\r\nhave been a penguin?'\r\n\r\n`I have little doubt on the matter, my boy,' and I was about to\r\nmake a few remarks on the habits of this bird, when my wife\r\ninterrupted me and begged us to come to dinner and continue our\r\nnatural history conversation at some future time. Fritz now\r\nsuddenly recollected his delicious wine, and producing his\r\nflask, begged his mother to taste it.\r\n\r\n`Try it first yourself,' said I; Fritz did so, and I instantly saw\r\nby his countenance that the liquor had passed through the first\r\nstage of fermentation and had become vinegar.\r\n\r\n`Never mind, my boy,' said my prudent wife, when she learned the\r\ncause of his wry faces, `we have wine already but no vinegar; I\r\nam really pleased at the transformation. Mixed with the fat\r\nwhich has fallen from our bird with roasting, it will make a\r\nmost delicious sauce which will be as good a relish as a salad.'\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved, as a corrective of the wild and fishy flavor\r\nof the penguin, as well as improving the taste of the fish. We\r\ndid full justice to the appetizing meal prepared for us, our\r\ngourds coming for the first time into use, and having done it\r\nfull justice, I produced the cocoanuts by way of dessert.\r\n\r\n`Here is better food for your little friend,' said I to Fritz,\r\nwho had been vainly endeavouring to persuade the monkey to taste\r\ndainty morsels of the food we had been eating. `The poor little\r\nanimal has been accustomed to nothing but its mother's milk; fetch\r\nme a saw, one of you.'\r\n\r\nI then, after extracting the milk of the nuts from their natural\r\nholes, carefully cut the shells in half, thus providing several\r\nmore useful basins. The monkey was perfectly satisfied with the\r\nmilk, and eagerly sucked the corner of a handkerchief dipped in it.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now rapidly sinking behind the horizon, and the poultry\r\nretiring for the night warned us that we must follow their example.\r\nHaving offered up our prayers, we lay down on our beds, the monkey\r\ncrouched down between Jack and Fritz, and we were all soon fast\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWe did not, however, long enjoy this repose; a loud barking from\r\nour dogs, who were on guard outside the tent, awakened us, and\r\nthe fluttering and cackling of our poultry warned us that a foe\r\nwas approaching. Fritz and I sprang up, and seizing our guns\r\nrushed out. There we found a desperate combat going on, our\r\ngallant dogs, surrounded by a dozen or more large jackals,\r\nwere fighting bravely, four of their opponents lay dead, but\r\nthe others were in no way deterred by the fate of their comrades.\r\n\r\nFritz and I, however, sent bullets through the heads of a couple\r\nmore, and the rest galloped off. Turk and Juno did not intend\r\nthat they should escape so cheaply, and pursuing them, they\r\ncaught, killed, and devoured another of the animals, regardless\r\nof their near relationship. Fritz wished to save one of the jackals\r\nthat he might be able to show it to his brothers in the morning;\r\ndragging therefore the one that he had shot near the tent, he\r\nconcealed it, and we once more returned to our beds. I told him\r\nthat in justice, if Turk and Flora were still hungry, we should\r\ngive this last jackal to them. But they, surfeited, curled up to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nSoundly and peacefully we slept until cock-crow next morning, when my\r\nwife and I awoke. I observed to her that I could not but view with\r\nalarm the many cares and exertions to be made. `In the first place, a\r\njourney to the vessel must be made. This is of absolute necessity, at\r\nleast, if we would not be deprived of the livestock and other useful\r\nthings, all of which from moment to moment we risk losing by the first\r\nheavy sea. What ought we first to resolve on? For example, should not\r\nour very first endeavour to be the contriving of a better sort of\r\nhabitation and a more secure retreat from wild beasts, as well as a\r\nseparate place for our provisions? I own I am at a loss what to begin\r\nfirst.'\r\n\r\n`Return to the wreck by all means,' replied my wife, cheerfully.\r\n`Patience, order and perseverance will help us through all our work,\r\nand I agree with you that a visit to the wreck is without doubt our\r\nfirst duty. Come, let us wake the children, and set to work without\r\ndelay.'\r\n\r\nThey were soon roused, and Fritz overcoming his drowsiness before the\r\nothers, ran out for his jackal; it was cold and stiff from the night\r\nair, and he placed it on its legs before the tent, in a most life-like\r\nattitude, and stood by to watch the effect upon the family.\r\n\r\nThe dogs were the first to perceive their enemy, and growling, seemed\r\ninclined to dispose of the animal as they had disposed of its brethren\r\nin the night, but Fritz called them off. The noise the dogs made,\r\nhowever, had the effect of bringing out the younger children, and many\r\nwere the exclamations they made at the sight of the strange animal.\r\n\r\n`A yellow dog!' cried Franz.\r\n\r\n`A wolf!' exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n`It is a striped fox,' said Ernest.\r\n\r\n`Hullo,' said Fritz. `The greatest men may make mistakes. Our\r\nProfessor does not know a jackal when he sees one.'\r\n\r\n`But really,' continued Ernest, examining the animal, `I think it is a\r\nfox.'\r\n\r\n`Very well, very well,' retorted Fritz, `no doubt you know better than\r\nyour father! He thinks it is a jackal.'\r\n\r\n`Come boys,' said I, `no more of this quarrelling; you are none of you\r\nvery far wrong, for the jackal partakes of the nature of all three,\r\ndog, wolf, and fox.'\r\n\r\nThe monkey had come out on Jack's shoulder, but no sooner did it catch\r\nsight of the jackal, than it fled precipitately back into the tent, and\r\nhid itself in a heap of moss until nothing was visible but the tip of\r\nits little nose. Jack soothed and comforted the frightened little\r\nanimal, and I then summoned them all to prayers, soon after which we\r\nbegan our breakfast.\r\n\r\nSo severely had we dealt with our supper the previous night, that we\r\nhad little to eat but the biscuits, which were so dry and hard, that,\r\nhungry as we were, we could not swallow much. Fritz and I took some\r\ncheese to help them down, while my wife and younger sons soaked theirs\r\nin water. Ernest roamed down to the shore, and looked about for\r\nshellfish.\r\n\r\nPresently he returned with a few whelks. `Ah,' said he, `if we had but\r\nsome butter.'\r\n\r\n`My good boy,' I replied, `Your perpetual \"if, if\", quite annoys me; I\r\nwould rather eat a bit of cheese with my biscuit at once, than think of\r\nifs, which bring us so meagre a harvest. Why do you not sit down and\r\neat cheese like the rest of us?'\r\n\r\n`Not while I can get butter,' he said, `see here, father,' and he\r\npointed to a large cask, `that barrel contains excellent salt butter. I\r\nmade a little opening in it with a knife; and see, I got enough to\r\nspread nicely upon this piece of biscuit.'\r\n\r\n`Really, Ernest,' I said, `we are indebted to you. I will open the\r\ncask.' So saying, I took a knife and carefully cut a small hole, so\r\nthat I could extract the butter without exposing the mass of it to the\r\neffects of the air and heat. Filling a cocoanut shell with the good\r\nDutch butter, we once more sat down, toasting our biscuits before the\r\nfire and spreading them with butter.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus employed, I noticed that the two dogs were lying\r\nunusually quietly by my side. I at first attributed this drowsiness to\r\ntheir large meal during the night, but I soon discovered that it arose\r\nfrom a different cause; the faithful animals had not escaped unhurt\r\nfrom their late combat, but had received several deep and painful\r\nwounds, especially about the neck. The dogs began to lick each other on\r\nthe places which they could not reach with their own tongues, and my\r\nwife carefully dressed the wounds with butter from which she had\r\nextracted the salt by washing.\r\n\r\n`One of the things we must not forget to look for in the vessel,' said\r\nFritz, `is a spiked collar for each of the dogs, as a protection to\r\nthem should they again be called upon to defend themselves and us from\r\nwild beasts.'\r\n\r\n`Oh yes,' exclaimed Jack, `but I can make spiked collars, if mother\r\nwill give me some help.'\r\n\r\n`Try by all means, my little fellow,' said I, `and persuade your\r\nmother to assist you; and now, Fritz,' I continued, `we must be\r\nstarting, for you and I are to make a trip to the wreck.'\r\n\r\n`That I will, my boy,' she cried, `for I would like to see what new\r\nfancy has come into your head. And all of us must remember that we may\r\nmake as many new inventions as we can think of. We cannot better employ\r\nyour time, and if you produce something useful, you will be rewarded\r\nwith the commendations of all.'\r\n\r\nI begged the party who were to remain on shore, to keep together as\r\nmuch as possible, reminded my younger sons to obey their mother in all\r\nthings, and having arranged a set of signals with my wife that we might\r\nexchange communications, asked a blessing on our enterprise. I erected\r\na signal-post, and while Fritz was making preparations for our\r\ndeparture, hoisted a strip of sailcloth as a flag; this flag was to\r\nremain hoisted so long as all was well on shore, but should our return\r\nbe desired, three shots were to be fired and the flag lowered.\r\n\r\nAll was now ready, and warning my wife that we might find it necessary\r\nto remain all night on the vessel, we tenderly bade adieu and embarked.\r\nExcept our guns and ammunition we were taking nothing, that we might\r\nleave as much space as possible for the stowage of a large cargo.\r\nFritz, however, had resolved to bring his little monkey, that he might\r\nobtain milk for it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe had not got far from the shore, when I perceived that a current from\r\nthe river set in directly for the vessel, and though my nautical\r\nknowledge was not great, I succeeded in steering the boat into the\r\nfavourable stream, which carried us nearly three-fourths of our passage\r\nwith little or no trouble to ourselves; then, by dint of hard pulling,\r\nwe accomplished the whole distance, and, entering through the breach,\r\ngladly made fast our boat and stepped on board.\r\n\r\nOur first care was to see to the animals, who greeted us with\r\njoy--lowing, bellowing, and bleating as we approached--not that the\r\npoor beasts were hungry, for they were all still well supplied with\r\nfood, but they were apparently pleased by the mere sight of human\r\nbeings. We removed any partly spoiled food and added a fresh supply,\r\nalong with fresh water.\r\n\r\nFritz then placed his monkey by one of the goats, and the little\r\nanimal immediately sucked the milk with evident relish, chattering and\r\ngrinning all the while; the monkey provided for, we refreshed ourselves\r\nwith a plentiful meal. `Now,' said I, `we have plenty to do; where\r\nshall we begin?'\r\n\r\n`Let us fix a mast and sail to our boat,' answered Fritz, `for the\r\ncurrent which brought us out will not take us back; whereas the fresh\r\nbreeze we met would help us immensely had we but a sail.'\r\n\r\nQuite startled, I demanded, `What makes you think of this at so\r\ncritical a time, when we have so many necessities to attend to?'\r\n\r\n`I must confess,' he said, `that I found it very difficult to row for\r\nso long a time, though I assure you I did my best and did not spare my\r\nstrength. I noticed that, though the wind blew strong in my face,\r\ntowards land, the current continued to carry us out. Now, as the\r\ncurrent will be of no use in our way back, I was thinking that we might\r\nmake the wind supply its place. Our boat will be very heavy when we\r\nhave loaded it with all the things we mean to take away, and I am\r\nafraid that I shall not be strong enough to row to land.'\r\n\r\n`You have reasoned well, my boy,' I replied, `and let us set to work at\r\nonce. Even so, we must take care not to overload the boat, as that\r\nmight risk our sinking or force us to throw supplies overboard.' I\r\nchose a stout spar to serve as a mast, and having made a hole in a\r\nplank nailed across one of the tubs we, with the help of a rope and a\r\ncouple of blocks, stepped it and secured it with stays.\r\n\r\nWe then discovered a lug-sail, which had belonged to one of the ship's\r\nboats; this we hoisted; and our craft was ready to sail. Fritz begged\r\nme to decorate the mast-head with a red streamer, to give our vessel a\r\nmore finished appearance. Smiling at this childish but natural vanity,\r\nI complied with his request. I then contrived a rudder, that I might be\r\nable to steer the boat; for though I knew that an oar would serve the\r\npurpose, it was cumbrous and inconvenient.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed, Fritz examined the shore with his glass, and\r\nsoon announced that the flag was flying and all was well.\r\n\r\nSo much time had now slipped away, that we found we could not return\r\nthat night, as I had wished. We signalled our intention of remaining on\r\nboard, and then spent the rest of our time in taking out the stones we\r\nhad placed in the boat for ballast, and stowed in their place heavy\r\narticles, of value to us.\r\n\r\nThe ship had sailed for the purpose of supplying a young colony; she\r\nhad therefore on board every conceivable article we could desire in our\r\npresent situation; our only difficulty indeed was to make a wise\r\nselection. Fritz seemed sanguine that we would be able to return for\r\nmore, but of that I was far from certain.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of powder and shot we first secured, and as Fritz\r\nconsidered that we could not have too many weapons, we added three\r\nexcellent guns, and a whole armful of swords, daggers and knives. We\r\nremembered that knives and forks and spoons were necessary, we\r\ntherefore laid in a large stock of them, and kitchen utensils of all\r\nsorts.\r\n\r\nExploring the captain's cabin, we discovered a service of silver-plate\r\nand a cellaret of good old wine; we then went over the stores, and\r\nsupplied ourselves with potted meats, portable soups, Westphalian hams,\r\nsausages, a bag of maize and wheat, and a quantity of other seeds and\r\nvegetables. I then added a barrel of sulphur for matches, and as much\r\nstring, cordage, and sailcloth as I could find.\r\n\r\nFritz reminded me that sleeping on the ground, even with the leaves and\r\nmoss the boys had collected, had been both cold and hard, and prevailed\r\nupon me to increase our cargo by some hammocks and blankets.\r\n\r\nAll this--with nails, tools and agricultural implements--completed our\r\ncargo, and sank our boat so low, that I should have been obliged to\r\nlighten her had not the sea been calm.\r\n\r\nNight drew on and a large fire, lighted by those on shore, showed us\r\nthat all was well. We replied by hoisting four ship's lanterns, and two\r\nshots announced us that our signal was perceived.\r\n\r\nThe ship seemed to be in so wretched a condition that the least\r\ntempest, such as might arise unexpectedly during the night, must\r\ncomplete her destructions. We resigned ourselves to sleeping in our\r\nsmall boat, which appeared safer than the great vessel. So, with a\r\nheartfelt prayer for the safety of our dear ones on shore, we retired,\r\nand Fritz at all events was soon sound asleep.\r\n\r\nFor a while I could not sleep, the thought of my wife and\r\nchildren--alone and unprotected, save by the great dogs--disturbed my\r\nrest. The night at length passed away. At daybreak Fritz and I arose,\r\nand went on deck. I brought the telescope to bear upon the shore, and\r\nwith pleasure saw the flag still waving in the morning breeze; while I\r\nkept the glass directed to the land, I saw the door of the tent open,\r\nand my wife appear and look steadfastly towards us.\r\n\r\nI at once hoisted a white flag, and in reply, the flag on shore was\r\nthrice dipped. Oh, what a weight seemed lifted from my heart as I saw\r\nthe signal!\r\n\r\n`Fritz,' I said, `now that I have had a sight of your mother, my next\r\nconcern is for the animals on board. Let us endeavour to save the lives\r\nof some of them, at least, and to take them with us.'\r\n\r\n`Would it be possible to make a raft,' suggested Fritz, `and get them\r\nall on it and in that way take them to shore?'\r\n\r\n`But how could we induce a cow, an ass, and a sow either to get upon a\r\nraft or, when there to remain motionless and quiet? The sheep and goats\r\none might perhaps find means to remove, they being of a more docile\r\ntemper; but for the larger animals, I am at a loss as to how to\r\nproceed.'\r\n\r\n`We could tie a long rope around the sow's neck,' Fritz now proposed,\r\n`and throw her without ceremony into the sea. Her immense bulk will be\r\nsure to sustain her above water, and by the rope, we can draw her after\r\nthe boat.'\r\n\r\n`An excellent idea,' I replied, `but unfortunately it is of no use but\r\nfor the pig;* and she is the one I care least about preserving.' In\r\nfact, I had an idea how to proceed, but I desired to allow Fritz to\r\ninvent a solution.\r\n\r\n   * In fact all of the animals would have been able to float,\r\n     though swimming against the strong current would have been\r\n     difficult. The solution chosen does not address this problem\r\n     at all.\r\n\r\n`Well,' said Fritz, `I can think of nothing else, unless indeed we make\r\nthem such swimming-belts as you made for the children.'\r\n\r\n`Really, my boy, that idea is worth having. I am not joking, indeed,' I\r\ncontinued, as I saw him smile, `we may get every one of the animals\r\nashore in that way.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, I caught a fine sheep, and proceeded to put our plan into\r\nexecution. I first fastened a broad piece of linen round its belly, and\r\nto this attached some corks and empty tins; then with Fritz's help, I\r\nflung the animal into the sea--it sank, but a moment afterwards rose\r\nand floated famously.\r\n\r\n`Hurrah!' exclaimed Fritz, `we will treat them all like that.' We then\r\nrapidly caught the other animals and provided them one after the other\r\nwith a similar contrivance. The cow and ass gave us more trouble than\r\ndid the others. For them we required something more buoyant than the\r\nmere cork; we at last found some empty casks and fastened two to each\r\nanimal by thongs passed under its belly.\r\n\r\nThis done, the whole herd were ready to start, and we brought the ass\r\nto one of the ports to be the first to be launched. After some\r\nmaneuvering we got him in a convenient position, and then a sudden\r\nheave sent him plunging into the sea. He sank, and then, buoyed up by\r\nthe casks, emerged head and back from the water.\r\n\r\nThe cow, sheep and goats followed him one after the other, and then the\r\nsow alone remained. She seemed, however determined not to leave the\r\nship; she kicked, struggled and squealed so violently, that I really\r\nthought we should be obliged to abandon her. Indeed, we found it\r\nnecessary to put a muzzle on her to prevent her from biting before we\r\ncould tie a large piece of cork under her body. At length, after much\r\ntrouble, we succeeded in sending her out of the port after the others,\r\nand when once in the water, such was the old lady's energy that she\r\nquickly distanced them, and was the first to reach the shore.\r\n\r\nWe had fastened to the horns or neck of each animal a cord with a\r\nfloat attached to the end, and now embarking, we gathered up these\r\nfloats, set sail, and steered for shore, drawing our herd after us. I\r\nsaw, now, how impossible it would have been for us to have succeeded in\r\nour enterprise without the aid of a sail; the weight of the goods sank\r\nthe boat so low in the water that none of our exertions would have\r\nallowed us to row such a distance. But with the sail, we proceeded so\r\ncompletely to our satisfaction that were able to get some biscuits and\r\nenjoyed a midday meal; then, while Fritz amused himself with his\r\nmonkey, I took up my glass and tried to make out how our dear ones on\r\nshore were employing themselves.\r\n\r\nAs I was thus engaged, a sudden shout from Fritz surprised me. I\r\nglanced up; there stood Fritz with his gun to his shoulder, pointing it\r\nat a huge shark. The monster was making for one of the finest sheep; he\r\nturned on his side to seize his prey; as the white of his belly\r\nappeared Fritz fired. The shot took effect, and our enemy disappeared,\r\nleaving a trace of blood on the calm water.\r\n\r\n`Well done, my boy,' I cried, `you will become a crack shot one of\r\nthese days; but I trust you will not often have such dangerous game to\r\nshoot.' Fritz's eyes sparkled at his success and my praise, and\r\nreloading his gun, carefully watched the water. But the shark did not\r\nagain appear, and borne onwards by the breeze, we quickly neared the\r\nshore. Steering the boat to a convenient landing place, I cast off the\r\nropes which secured the animals, and let them get ashore as best they\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of my wife or children when we stepped on land, but a\r\nfew moments afterwards they appeared, and with a shout of joy ran\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\nWe were thankful to be once more united, and after asking and replying\r\nto a few preliminary questions, proceeded to release our herd from\r\ntheir swimming belts, which, though so useful in the water, were\r\nexceedingly inconvenient on shore. My wife was astonished at the\r\napparatus. `How clever you are,' said she.\r\n\r\n`I am not the inventor,' I replied, `the honour is due to Fritz. He not\r\nonly thought of this plan for bringing off the animals, but saved one\r\nat least of them from a most fearful death.' And I then told them how\r\nbravely he had encountered the shark. My wife was delighted with her\r\nson's success, but declared that she would dread our trips to the\r\nvessel more than ever, knowing that such savage fish inhabited the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nFritz, Ernest and I began the work of unloading our craft, while Jack,\r\nseeing that the poor donkey was still encumbered with his\r\nswimming-belt, tried to free him from it. But the donkey would not\r\nstand quiet, and the child's fingers were not strong enough to loosen\r\nthe cordage; finally, therefore, he scrambled upon the animal's back,\r\nand urging him on with hand and foot, trotted towards us.\r\n\r\n`Come, my boy,' I said, `no one must be idle here, even for a moment;\r\nyou will have riding practise enough hereafter; dismount and come and\r\nhelp us.'\r\n\r\nJack was soon on his feet. `But I have not been idle all day,' he\r\nsaid, `look here!' and he pointed to a belt round his waist. It was a\r\nbroad belt of yellow skin in which he had stuck a couple of pistols and\r\na knife. `And see,' he added, `what I have made for the dogs. Here,\r\nJuno, Turk,' the dogs came bounding up at his call, and I saw that they\r\nwere each supplied with a collar of the same skin, in which were\r\nfastened nails, which bristled round their necks in a most formidable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n`Capital, capital! my boy,' said I, `but where did you get your\r\nmaterials, and who helped you?'\r\n\r\n`Except in sewing,' said my wife, `he had little assistance, and as for\r\nthe materials, Fritz's jackal supplied us with the skin, and the\r\nneedles and thread came out of my wonderful bag. You little think how\r\nmany useful things may be had from that same bag; it is woman's duty\r\nand nature, you know, to see after trifles.'\r\n\r\nFritz evidently did not approve of the use to which his jackal's hide\r\nhad been devoted, and holding his nose, begged his little brother to\r\nkeep at a distance. `Really, Jack,' he said, `you should have cured the\r\nhide before you used it, the smell is disgusting, don't come near me.'\r\n\r\n`It's not the hide that smells at all,' retorted Jack, `it is your\r\nnasty jackal itself that you left in the sun.'\r\n\r\n`Now, boys,' said I, `no quarrelling here; do you, Jack, help your\r\nbrother to drag the carcase to the sea, and if your belt smells after\r\nthat you must take it off and dry it better.'\r\n\r\nThe jackal was dragged off, and we then finished our work of unloading\r\nour boat. When this was accomplished we started for our tent, and\r\nfinding there no preparation for supper, I said, `Fritz, let us have a\r\nWestphalian ham.'\r\n\r\n`Ernest,' said my wife, smiling, `let us see if we cannot conjure up\r\nsome eggs.'\r\n\r\nFritz got out a splendid ham and carried it to his mother\r\ntriumphantly, while Ernest set before me a dozen white balls with\r\nparchment-like coverings.\r\n\r\n`Turtles' eggs!' said I. `Well done, Ernest, where did you get them?'\r\n\r\n`That,' replied my wife, `shall be told in due course when we relate\r\nour adventures; now we will see what they will do towards making a\r\nsupper for you; with these and your ham I do not think we shall\r\nstarve.'\r\n\r\nLeaving my wife to prepare supper, we returned to the shore and\r\nbrought up what of the cargo we had left there; then, having collected\r\nour herd of animals (except for the sow, which ran away, and the ducks\r\nand geese which deserted us for a nearby marshy swamp), we returned to\r\nthe tent.\r\n\r\nThe meal which awaited us was as unlike the first supper we had there\r\nenjoyed as possible. My wife had improvised a table of a board laid on\r\ntwo casks, on this was spread a white damask tablecloth, on which were\r\nplaced knives, forks, spoons and plates for each person. A tureen of\r\ngood soup first appeared, followed by a capital omelette, then slices\r\nof the ham; and finally some Dutch cheese, butter and biscuits, with a\r\nbottle of the captain's canary wine, completed the repast.\r\n\r\nWhile we thus regaled ourselves, I related to my wife our adventures,\r\nand then begged she would remember her promise and tell me all that had\r\nhappened in my absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n`I will spare you a description,' said my wife, `of our first day's\r\noccupations; truth to tell, I spent the time chiefly in anxious thought\r\nand watching your progress and signals. I rose very early this morning,\r\nand with the utmost joy perceiving your signal that all was right,\r\nhastened to reply to it, and then while my sons yet slumbered, I sat\r\ndown and began to consider how our position could be improved.\r\n\r\n`\"For it is perfectly impossible,\" said I to myself, \"to live much\r\nlonger where we are now. The sun beats burningly the livelong day on\r\nthis bare rocky spot, our only shelter is this poor tent, beneath the\r\ncanvas of which the heat is even more oppressive than on the open\r\nshore. Why should not I and my little boys exert ourselves as well as\r\nmy husband and Fritz? Why should not we too try to accomplish something\r\nuseful?\r\n\r\n`\"If we could but exchange this melancholy and unwholesome abode for\r\na pleasant shady dwelling-place, we should all improve in health and\r\nspirits. Among those delightful woods and groves where Fritz and his\r\nfather saw so many charming things, I feel sure there must be some\r\nlittle retreat where we could establish ourselves comfortably; there\r\nmust be, and I will find it.\"\r\n\r\n`By this time the boys were up, and I observed Jack very quietly and\r\nbusily occupied with his knife about the spot where Fritz's jackal lay.\r\nWatching his proceedings, I saw that he had cut two long narrow strips\r\nof the animal's skin, which he cleaned and scraped very carefully, and\r\nthen taking a handful of great nails out of his pocket, he stuck them\r\nthrough the skin points outwards, after which he cut strips of canvas\r\nsailcloth twice as broad as the thongs, doubled them, and laid them on\r\nthe raw side of the skin so as to cover the broad flat nail heads.\r\n\r\n`At this point of the performance, Master Jack came to me with the\r\nagreeable request that I would kindly stitch the canvas and (moist)\r\nskin together for him. I gave him needles and thread, but could not\r\nthink of depriving him of the pleasure of doing it himself.\r\n\r\n`However, when I saw how good-humouredly he persevered in the work with\r\nhis awkward unskilful fingers, I took pity upon him, and conquering the\r\ndisgust I felt, finished lining the skin dog-collars he had so\r\ningeniously contrived. After this I was called upon to complete in the\r\nsame way a fine belt of skin he had made for himself. I advised him to\r\nthink of some means by which the skin might be kept from shrinking.\r\n\r\n`Ernest, although rather treating Jack's manufacture with ridicule,\r\nproposed a sensible-enough plan, which Jack forthwith put in execution.\r\nHe nailed the skin, stretched flat, on a board, and put it in the sun\r\nto dry.\r\n\r\n`My scheme of a journey was agreed to joyously by my young companions.\r\nPreparations were instantly set on foot: weapons and provisions\r\nprovided: the two elder boys carrying guns, while they gave me charge\r\nof the water flask, and a small hatchet.\r\n\r\n`Leaving everything in as good order as we could at the tent, we\r\nproceeded towards the stream, accompanied by the dogs. Turk, who had\r\naccompanied you on your first expedition, seemed immediately to\r\nunderstand that we wished to pursue the same route, and proudly led the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n`As I looked at my two young sons, each with his gun, and considered\r\nhow much the safety of the party depended on these little fellows, I\r\nfelt grateful to you, dear husband, for having acquainted them in\r\nchildhood with the use of firearms.\r\n\r\n`Filling our water-jar, we crossed the stream, and went on to the\r\nheight from whence, as you described, a lovely prospect is obtained, at\r\nthe sight of which a pleasurable sensation of buoyant hope, to which I\r\nhad long been a stranger, awoke within my breast.\r\n\r\n`A pretty little wood in the distance attracted my notice\r\nparticularly, and thither we directed our course. But soon finding it\r\nimpossible to force our way through the tall strong grass which grew in\r\ndense luxuriance higher than the children's heads, we turned towards\r\nthe open beach on our left, and following it we reached a point much\r\nnearer the little wood, when, quitting the strand, we made towards it.\r\n\r\n`We had not entirely escaped the tall grass, however and with the\r\nutmost fatigue and difficulty were struggling through the reeds, when\r\nsuddenly a great rushing noise terrified us all dreadfully. A very\r\nlarge and powerful bird sprang upward on the wing. Both boys attempted\r\nto take aim, but the bird was far away before they were ready to fire.\r\n\r\n`\"Oh dear, what a pity!\" exclaimed Ernest; \"now if I had only had my\r\nlight gun, and if the bird had not flown quite so fast, I should have\r\nbrought him down directly!\"\r\n\r\n`\"Oh yes,\" said I, \"no doubt you would be a capital sportsman if only\r\nyour game would always give you time to make ready comfortably.\"\r\n\r\n`\"But I had no notion that anything was going to fly up just at our\r\nfeet like that,\" cried he.\r\n\r\n`\"A good shot,\" I replied, \"must be prepared for surprises: neither\r\nwild birds nor wild beasts will send you notice that they are about to\r\nfly or to run.\"\r\n\r\n`\"What sort of bird can it have been?' inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n`\"Oh, it certainly must have been an eagle,\" answered little Franz, \"it\r\nwas so very big!\"\r\n\r\n`\"Just as if every big bird must be an eagle!\" replied Ernest, in a\r\ntone of derision.\r\n\r\n`\"Let's see where he was sitting, at all events!\" said I.\r\n\r\n`Jack sprang towards the place, and instantly a second bird, rather\r\nlarger than the first, rushed upward into the air, with a most\r\nstartling noise.\r\n\r\n`The boys stood staring upwards, perfectly stupefied, while I laughed\r\nheartily, saying, \"Well, you are first-rate sportsmen, to be sure! You\r\ncertainly will keep my larder famously well supplied!\"\r\n\r\n`At this, Ernest coloured up, and looked inclined to cry, while Jack\r\nput on a comical face, pulled off his cap, and with a low bow, called\r\nafter the fugitive, \"Adieu for the present, sir! I live in hopes of\r\nanother meeting!\"\r\n\r\n`On searching the ground carefully, we discovered a rude sort of nest\r\nmade untidily of dry grass. It was empty, although we perceived broken\r\negg-shells at no great distance, and concluded that the young brood had\r\nescaped among the grass, which, in fact, we could see was waving at a\r\nlittle distance, as the little birds ran through it.\r\n\r\n`\"Now look here, Franz,\" said Ernest, presently, \"just consider how\r\nthis bird could by any possibility have been an eagle. Eagles never\r\nbuild on the ground, neither can their young leave the nest and run as\r\nsoon as they are out of the egg. That is a peculiarity of the\r\ngallinaceous tribe of birds alone, to which then these must belong. The\r\nspecies, I think, is indicated by the white belly and dull red colour\r\nof the wing coverts which I observed in these specimens, and I believe\r\nthem to be bustards, especially as I noticed in the largest the fine\r\nmoustache-like feathers over the beak, peculiar to the Great Bustard.\"\r\n\r\n`\"My dear boy!\" I said, \"your eyes were actively employed, I must\r\nconfess, if your fingers were unready with the gun. And after all, it\r\nis just as well, perhaps, that we have not thrown the bustard's family\r\ninto mourning.\"\r\n\r\n`Thus chatting, we at length approached my pretty wood. Numbers of\r\nbirds fluttered and sang among the high branches, but I did not\r\nencourage the boys in their wish to try to shoot any of the happy\r\nlittle creatures. We were lost in admiration of the trees of this\r\ngrove, and I cannot describe to you how wonderful they are, nor can you\r\nform the least idea of their enormous size without seeing them\r\nyourself. What we had been calling a wood proved to be a group of about\r\na dozen trees only, and, what was strange, the roots sustained the\r\nmassive trunks exalted in the air, forming strong arches, and props and\r\nstays all around each individual stem, which was firmly rooted in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n`I gave Jack some twine, and scrambling up one of the curious open-air\r\nroots, he succeeded in measuring round the trunk itself, and made it\r\nout to be about eighteen yards. I saw no sort of fruit, but the foliage\r\nis thick and abundant, throwing delicious shade on the ground beneath,\r\nwhich is carpeted with soft green herbage, and entirely free from\r\nthorns, briars, or bushes of any kind. It is the most charming\r\nresting-place that ever was seen, and I and the boys enjoyed our midday\r\nmeal immensely in this glorious palace of the woods, so grateful to our\r\nsenses after the glare and heat of our journey thither.\r\n\r\n`The dogs joined us after a while. They had lingered behind on the\r\nsea-shore, and I was surprised to see them lie down and go comfortably\r\nto sleep without begging for food, as they do usually when we eat.\r\n\r\n`The longer we remained in this enchanting place, the more did it\r\ncharm my fancy; and if we could but manage to live in some sort of\r\ndwelling up among the branches of those grand, noble trees, I should\r\nfeel perfectly safe and happy. It seemed to me absurd to suppose we\r\nshould ever find another place half so lovely, so I determined to\r\nsearch no further, but return to the beach and see if anything from the\r\nwreck had been cast up by the waves, which we could carry away with us.\r\n\r\n`Before starting, Jack persuaded me to sit quietly a little longer, and\r\nfinish making his belt and the spike-collars for the dogs, for you must\r\nknow that the child had actually been carrying the board on which these\r\nwere stretched all this time, so that they should get the full benefit\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\n`As they were now quite dry, I completed them easily, and Jack girded\r\non the belt with great pride, placing his pistols in it, and marching\r\nabout in a most self-important style, while Ernest fitted the collars\r\non the two dogs.\r\n\r\n`On reaching the shore, we found it strewed with many articles,\r\ndoubtless of value, but all too heavy for us to lift. We rolled some\r\ncasks, however, beyond high-water mark, and dragged a chest or two also\r\nhigher on the beach; and, while doing so, observed that our dogs were\r\nbusy among the rocks. They were carefully watching the crevices and\r\npools, and every now and then would pounce downwards and seize\r\nsomething which they swallowed with apparent relish.\r\n\r\n`\"They are eating crabs,\" said Jack. \"No wonder they have not seemed\r\nhungry lately.\"\r\n\r\n`And, sure enough, they were catching the little green crabs with\r\nwhich the water abounded. These, however, did not apparently entirely\r\nsatisfy them.\r\n\r\n`Some time afterwards, just as we were about to turn inland towards the\r\nford, we noticed that Juno was scraping in the sand, and turning up\r\nsome round substances, which she hastily devoured.\r\n\r\n`Ernest went to see what these were, and reported in his calm way that\r\nthe dog had found turtles' eggs.\r\n\r\n`\"Oh,\" cried I, \"then let us by all means share in the booty!\" Mrs.\r\nJuno, however, did not at all approve of this, and it was with some\r\ndifficulty that we drove her aside while we gathered a couple of dozen\r\nof the eggs, stowing them in our provision bags. While thus employed,\r\nwe caught sight of a sail which appeared to be merrily approaching the\r\nshore beyond the cliffs. Ernest declared it must be our raft. Little\r\nFranz, always having the fear of savages before his eyes, began to look\r\nfrightened, and for a moment I myself was doubtful what to think.\r\n\r\n`However, we hastened to the stream; and, crossing it by the\r\nstepping-stones, came in sight of the landing-place, where we joyfully\r\nmet you.\r\n\r\n`Now I hope you approve of the proceedings of your exploring party, and\r\nthat tomorrow you will do me the favour of packing everything up, and\r\ntaking us away to live amongst my splendid trees.'\r\n\r\n`Aye, little wife,' said I, `so that is your idea of comfort and\r\nsecurity is it! A tree, I do not know how many feet high, on which we\r\nare to perch and roost like the birds? If we had but wings or a\r\nballoon, it would, I own, be a capital plan.'\r\n\r\n`Laugh as much as you like,' returned my wife, `my idea is not so\r\nabsurd as you make it out. We should be safe up there from jackals'\r\nvisits during the night. And I know I have seen at home in Switzerland,\r\nquite a pretty arbour, with a strong floor, up among the branches of a\r\nlime tree, and we went up a staircase to reach it. Why could not we\r\ncontrive a place like that, where we could sleep safely at night?'\r\n\r\n`I will consider the idea seriously, my wife,' said I, `perhaps\r\nsomething may come of it, after all! Meantime, as we have finished\r\nsupper, and night is coming on, let us commend ourselves to Almighty\r\nprotection and retire to rest.'\r\n\r\nBeneath the shelter of our tent, we all slept soundly as marmots,\r\nuntil break of day; when, my wife and I awaking, took counsel together\r\nas to future proceedings.\r\n\r\nReferring to the task she had the previous evening proposed for me, I\r\nremarked that to undertake it would involve so many difficulties that\r\nit was highly necessary to look closely into the subject.\r\n\r\n`In the first place,' said I, `I am unwilling hastily to quit a spot to\r\nwhich I am convinced we were providentially led as a landing-place. See\r\nhow secure it is; guarded on all sides by these high cliffs, and\r\naccessible only by the narrow passage to the ford, while from this\r\npoint it is so easy to reach the ship that the whole of its valuable\r\ncargo is at our disposal. Suppose we decide to stay patiently here for\r\nthe present--until, at least, we have brought on shore everything we\r\npossibly can?'\r\n\r\n`I agree with you to a certain extent, dear husband,' replied she, `but\r\nyou do not know how dreadfully the heat among the rocks tries me. It is\r\nalmost intolerable to us who remain here all day while you and Fritz\r\nare away out at sea, or wandering among the shady woods, where cool\r\nfruits refresh, and fair scenes delight you.\r\n\r\n`As to the contents of the ship, an immense deal has been cast ashore,\r\nand I would much rather give up all the remainder, and be spared the\r\npainful anxiety it gives me when you even talk of venturing again on\r\nthe faithless deep.'\r\n\r\n`Well, I must admit that there is much right on your side,' I\r\ncontinued; `suppose we were to remove to your chosen abode, and make\r\nthis rocky fastness our magazine and place of retreat in case of\r\ndanger. I could easily render it still more secure, by blasting\r\nportions of the rock with gunpowder. But a bridge must be constructed\r\nin the first place, to enable us to cross bag and baggage.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, I shall be parched to death before we can leave this place, if a\r\nbridge has to be made,' cried my wife impatiently. `Why not just take\r\nour things on our backs and wade across as we have done already? The\r\ncow and the donkey could carry a great deal.'\r\n\r\n`That they will have to do, in whatever fashion we make the move,' said\r\nI; `but bags and baskets we must have, to put things in, and if you\r\nwill turn your attention to providing those, I will set about the\r\nbridge at once. It will be wanted not once, but continually; the stream\r\nwill probably swell and be impassable at times, and even as it is, an\r\naccident might happen.'\r\n\r\n`Well, well!' cried my wife, `I submit to your opinion; only pray set\r\nabout it without delay, for I long to be off. It is an excellent idea\r\nto make a strong place among the cliffs here; the gunpowder especially,\r\nI shall be delighted to see stored here when we go away, for it is\r\nfrightfully dangerous to keep so much as we have close to our\r\nhabitation.'\r\n\r\n`Gunpowder is indeed the most dangerous and at the same time the most\r\nuseful thing we have,' said I, `and for both these reasons we must be\r\nespecially careful of it. In time I will hollow out a place in the rock\r\nwhere we can store it safe from either fire or damp.'\r\n\r\nBy this morning's consultation we had settled the weighty question of\r\nour change of abode, and also chalked out work for the day. When the\r\nchildren heard of the proposed move their joy was boundless; they began\r\nat once to talk of it as our `journey to the Promised Land', and only\r\nregretted that time must be `wasted', as they said, in bridge-building\r\nbefore it could be undertaken.\r\n\r\nEveryone being impatient for breakfast that work might be begun at\r\nonce, the cow and goats were milked, and, having enjoyed a comfortable\r\nmeal of biscuit boiled in milk, I prepared to start for the wreck, in\r\norder to obtain planks for the proposed bridge.\r\n\r\nErnest as well as Fritz accompanied me, and we were soon within the\r\ninfluence of the current, and were carried swiftly out to sea. Fritz\r\nwas steering, and we had no sooner passed beyond the islet at the\r\nentrance of the bay, so as to come in sight of its seaward beach, than\r\nwe were astonished to see a countless multitude of sea-birds, gulls and\r\nothers, which rose like a cloud into the air, disturbed by our\r\napproach, and deafened us by their wild and screaming cries.\r\n\r\nFritz caught up his gun, and would have sent a shot among them had I\r\npermitted it. I was very curious to find out what could be the great\r\nattraction for all this swarm of feathered fowl; and, availing myself\r\nof a fresh breeze from the sea, I set the sail and directed our course\r\ntowards the island.\r\n\r\nThe swelling sail and flying pennant charmed Ernest, while Fritz bent\r\nhis keen eyes eagerly towards the sandy shore, where the flocks of\r\nbirds were again settling.\r\n\r\nPresently he shouted, `Aha, now I see what they are after! They have\r\ngot a huge monster of a fish there, and a proper feast they are making!\r\nLet's have a nearer look at it, father!'\r\n\r\nWe could not take our boat very close in, but we managed to effect a\r\nlanding at a short distance from the festive scene; and, securing the\r\nraft by casting a rope round a large stone, we cautiously drew near the\r\nobject of interest.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a monstrous fish, on whose flesh these multitudes of\r\nbirds were ravenously feeding; and it was extraordinary to watch the\r\nferocity, the envy, the gluttony, and all manner of evil passions,\r\nexhibited among the guests at this banquet.\r\n\r\n`There was nothing on this sandy beach when we passed yesterday, I am\r\ncertain, father,' said Fritz. `It seems strange to see this creature\r\nstranded here.'\r\n\r\n`Why, Fritz!' cried Ernest, `it must be the shark! Your shark, you\r\nknow! I believe I can see where you hit him in the head.'\r\n\r\n`You are right, I do believe, Ernest,' said I, `though I think your\r\nimagination only can distinguish the gunshot wounds among all the\r\npecking and tearing of the voracious birds there. Just look, boys, at\r\nthose terrific jaws, beneath the strangely projecting snout. See the\r\nrows upon rows of murderous teeth, and thank God we were delivered from\r\nthem! Let us try if we can induce these greedy birds to spare us a bit\r\nof the shark's skin; it is extremely rough, and when dry may be used\r\nlike a file.'\r\n\r\nErnest drew the ramrod from his gun, and charged so manfully into the\r\ncrowd, that striking right and left he speedily killed several, whilst\r\nmost of the others took to flight. Fritz detached some broad strips of\r\nskin with his knife, and we returned towards the boat.\r\n\r\nPerceiving with satisfaction that the shore was strewn with just the\r\nsort of boards and planks I wanted, I lost no time in collecting them;\r\nand, forming a raft to tow after us, we were in a short time able to\r\ndirect our course homeward, without visiting the wreck at all.\r\n\r\nAs we sailed along, extremely well pleased with our good fortune,\r\nFritz, by my direction, nailed part of the shark's skin flat on boards\r\nto dry in the sun and the rest on the rounded mast.\r\n\r\n`Will that be a good idea, father?' inquired he, `it will be quite bent\r\nand crooked when it hardens.'\r\n\r\n`That is just what I want it to be,' said I, `we may happen to find it\r\nuseful in that form as well as flat. It would be beautiful shagreen*\r\nwith which we could smooth and polish wood.'\r\n\r\n    * Rough leather used like sandpaper\r\n\r\n`I thought,' remarked Ernest, `that shagreen was made from asses'\r\nhides.'\r\n\r\n`And you thought rightly,' said I. `The best shagreen is prepared in\r\nTurkey, Persia, and Tartary, from the skins of horses and asses. In\r\nthese skins, the roughness is produced artificially; while the skin is\r\nnewly flayed and still soft, hard grains of corn are spread on the\r\nunder surface, and pressed into it as it dries. These grains are\r\nafterward removed, and the roughness imparted to the appearance of the\r\nskin remains indelibly; shagreen is useful in polishing joiners' work,\r\nand it is made in France from the rough skin of a hideous creature\r\ncalled the angel-fish.'\r\n\r\n`Angel-fish!' exclaimed Fritz; `what a name to give to anything\r\n\"hideous,\" father!'\r\n\r\n`There are bad angels as well as good ones,' observed Ernest, in his\r\ndry, quiet way; `it is better to leave people to see for themselves\r\nwhich is meant.'\r\n\r\nBy this time we were close in shore; and, lowering the sail, we soon\r\nhad our craft with the raft in tow, safely moored to the bank.\r\n\r\nNo one was in sight, not a sound to be heard, so with united voice we\r\ngave a loud cheery halloo, which after a while was answered in shrill\r\ntones, and my wife with her two boys came running from behind the high\r\nrocks between us and the stream, each carrying a small bundle in a\r\nhandkerchief, while little Franz held aloft a landing-net.\r\n\r\nOur return so soon was quite unexpected, and they anxiously inquired\r\nthe reason, which we soon explained; and then the mysterious bundles\r\nwere opened, and a great number of fine crawfish displayed; whose\r\nefforts to escape by scuttling away in every direction, directly they\r\nwere placed in a heap on the ground, caused immense fun and laughter as\r\nthe boys pursued and brought them back, only to find others scrambling\r\noff in a dozen different ways.\r\n\r\n`Now, father, have we not done well, today!' cried Jack, `did you ever\r\nsee such a splendid crawfish? Oh, there were thousands of them, and I\r\nam sure we have got two hundred here at least. Just look at their\r\nclaws!'\r\n\r\n`No doubt you were the discoverer of these fine crabs, eh, Jack?' said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n`No! Fancy young Franz being the lucky man!' answered he. `He and I\r\nwent towards the stream while mother was busy, just to look for a good\r\nplace for the bridge. Franz was picking up pebbles and alabasters, some\r\nbecause they were so pretty, some to strike sparks with in the dark,\r\nand some he insisted were \"gold.\"\r\n\r\n`\"Jack! Jack!\" cried he presently, \"come and see the crabs on Fritz's\r\njackal!\" You know we threw it away there, and to be sure it was\r\nswarming with these creatures. Are you glad we have found them, father?\r\nWill they be good to eat?'\r\n\r\n`Very excellent, my boy, and we may be thankful that food for our\r\nwants is thus provided day by day.'\r\n\r\nWhen each party had related the day's adventures, and while my wife was\r\ncooking the crawfish, we went to bring our store of planks to land.\r\nEven this apparently simple operation required thought, and I had to\r\nimprovise rope-harness for the cow and the donkey, by which we could\r\nmake them drag each board separately from the water's edge to the\r\nmargin of the stream.\r\n\r\nJack showed me where he thought the bridge should be, and I certainly\r\nsaw no better place, as the banks were at that point tolerably close to\r\none another, steep, and of about equal height.\r\n\r\n`How shall we find out if our planks are long enough to reach across?'\r\nsaid I. `A surveyor's table would be useful now.'\r\n\r\n`What do you say to a ball of string, father?' said Ernest. `Tie one\r\nend to a stone, throw it across, then draw it back, and measure the\r\nline!'\r\n\r\nAdopting my son's idea, we speedily ascertained the distance across to\r\nbe eighteen feet. Then allowing three feet more at each side, I\r\ncalculated twenty-four feet as the necessary length of the boards.\r\n\r\nThe question as to how the planks were to be laid across was a\r\ndifficult one. We resolved to discuss it during dinner, to which we\r\nwere now summoned. And my wife, as we sat resting, displayed to me her\r\nneedlework. With hard labour had she made two large canvas bags for the\r\nass to carry. Having no suitable needle, she had been obliged to bore\r\nthe hole for each stitch with a nail, and gained great praise for her\r\ningenuity and patience.\r\n\r\nDinner was quickly dispatched, as we were all eager to continue our\r\nengineering work. A scheme had occurred to me for conveying one end of\r\na plank across the water, and I set about it in this way.\r\n\r\nThere fortunately were one or two trees close to the stream on either\r\nside; I attached a rope pretty near one end of a beam, and slung it\r\nloosely to the tree beside us; then, fastening a long rope to the other\r\nend, I crossed with it by means of broken rocks and stones, and having\r\na pulley and block, I soon arranged the rope on a strong limb of the\r\nopposite tree, again returning with the end to our own side.\r\n\r\nNow putting my idea to the proof, I brought the ass and the cow, and\r\nfastening this rope to the harness I had previously contrived for them,\r\nI drove them steadily away from the bank. To my great satisfaction, and\r\nthe surprise and delight of the boys, the end of the plank which had\r\nbeen laid alongside the stream began gently to move, rose higher,\r\nturned, and soon projecting over the water continued to advance, until,\r\nhaving described the segment of a circle, it reached the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nI stopped my team, the plank rested on the ground, the bridge was\r\nmade! So at least thought Fritz and Jack, who in a moment were lightly\r\nrunning across the narrow way, shouting joyfully as they sprang to the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nOur work was now comparatively easy. A second and third plank were laid\r\nbeside the first; and when these were carefully secured at each end to\r\nthe ground and to the trees, we very quickly laid short boards side by\r\nside across the beams, the boys nailing them lightly down as I sawed\r\nthem in lengths; and when this was done, our bridge was pronounced\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the excitement of the children. They danced to and\r\nfro on the wonderful structure, singing, shouting and cutting the\r\nwildest capers. I must confess I heartily sympathized with their\r\ntriumphant feelings.\r\n\r\nNow that the work was done, we began to feel how much we were\r\nfatigued, and gladly returned to our tent for refreshment and repose.\r\n\r\nNext morning, while we breakfasted, I made a little speech to my sons\r\non the subject of the important move we were about to make, wishing to\r\nimpress them with a sense of the absolute necessity of great caution.\r\n\r\n`Remember,' said I, `that, although you all begin to feel very much at\r\nyour ease here, we are yet complete strangers to a variety of dangers\r\nwhich may surprise us unawares. I charge you, therefore, to maintain\r\ngood order, and keep together on the march. No darting off into\r\nbye-ways, Jack. No lingering behind to philosophize, Ernest. And now\r\nall hands to work.'\r\n\r\nThe greatest activity instantly prevailed in our camp. Some collected\r\nprovisions, others packed kitchen utensils, tools, ropes, and hammocks,\r\narranging them as burdens for the cow and ass.\r\n\r\nMy wife pleaded for a seat on the latter for her little Franz, and\r\nassuring me likewise that she could not possibly leave the poultry,\r\neven for a night, nor exist an hour without her magic bag, I agreed to\r\ndo my best to please her, without downright cruelty to animals.\r\n\r\nAway ran the children to catch the cocks and hens. Great chasing,\r\nfluttering and cackling ensued; but with no success whatever, until my\r\nwife recalled her panting sons, and, scattering some handfuls of grain\r\nwithin the open tent, soon decoyed the fowls and pigeons into the\r\nenclosure; where, when the curtain was dropped, they were easily\r\ncaught, tied together, and placed on the cow.\r\n\r\nThis amiable and phlegmatic animal had stood calmly chewing the cud,\r\nwhile package after package was disposed on her broad back, nor did she\r\nnow object even to this noisy addition to her load. I placed a couple\r\nof half-hoops over all; and, spreading sailcloth on them, put the fowls\r\nin darkness, and they rapidly became quiet; and the cow, with the\r\nappearance of having a small waggon on her back, was ready to start.\r\n\r\nFranz was firmly seated on the ass, amidst bags and bundles of all\r\nsorts and sizes; they rose about him like cushions and pillows, and his\r\ncurly head rested on the precious magic bag, which surmounted all the\r\nrest. Having filled the tent with the things we left behind, closing it\r\ncarefully, and ranging chests and casks around it, we were finally\r\nready to be off, each well equipped and in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\nFritz and his mother led the van. Franz (the young cavalier), and the\r\nsober-minded cow followed them closely.\r\n\r\nJack conducted the goats; one of these had also a rider, for Knips the\r\nmonkey was seated on his foster-mother, whose patience was sorely tried\r\nby his restlessness and playful tricks.\r\n\r\nThe sheep were under Ernest's care, and I brought up the rear of this\r\npatriarchal band, while the two dogs kept constantly running backwards\r\nand forwards in the character of aides-de-camp.\r\n\r\n`We seem delightfully like those simple and pastoral tribes I have read\r\nof,' said Ernest, as we proceeded, `whose whole lives are spent in\r\nshifting from place to place, without any wish to settle.'\r\n\r\n`Yes,' said I. `Among the Arabs, Tartars, and some other Eastern\r\nnations, this mode of life is natural. They for that reason are called\r\nNomads.\r\n\r\n`These tribes are amply provided with camels and horses, and effect\r\ntheir journeys more quickly and conveniently than we are likely to do\r\nwith these deliberate quadrupeds of ours. Whatever you young folks may\r\nthink, I suspect your mother and I will be quite satisfied with one\r\nsuch undertaking. At least I hope she will be contended with the nest\r\nshe intends me to build for her up in her wonderful trees.'\r\n\r\nWith honest pride I introduced my wife to my bridge, and after\r\nreceiving from her what I considered well-merited praise for my skill\r\nin its construction, we passed over it in grand procession, reinforced\r\nunexpectedly on the opposite side by the arrival of our cross-grained\r\nold sow. The perverse creature had obstinately resisted our attempts to\r\nbring her with us, but finding herself deserted, had followed of her\r\nown accord, testifying in the most unmistakable manner, by angry grunts\r\nand squeals, her entire disapproval of our proceedings.\r\n\r\nI soon found we must, as before, turn down to the sea beach, for not\r\nonly did the rank grass impede our progress, but it also tempted the\r\nanimals to break away from us, and, but for our watchful dogs, we might\r\nhave lost several of them.\r\n\r\nOn the firm, open sands we were making good way, when to my annoyance,\r\nboth our dogs suddenly left us, and springing into the thick cover to\r\nour right, commenced a furious barking, following by howling as if in\r\nfear and violent pain.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment doubting that some dangerous animal was at hand, I\r\nhastened to the spot, remarking as I went the characteristic behaviour\r\nof my three older sons.\r\n\r\nFritz cocked his gun and advanced boldly, but with caution. Ernest\r\nlooked disconcerted, and drew back, but got ready to fire, while Jack\r\nhurried after Fritz without so much as unslinging his gun from his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nBefore I could come up with them, I heard Jack shouting excitedly:\r\n\r\n`Father! Father! Come quickly! A huge porcupine! A most enormous\r\nporcupine!'\r\n\r\nSure enough, the dogs were rushing round and round a porcupine, and\r\nhaving attempted to seize it, were already severely wounded by its\r\nquills. Each time they came near, the creature, with a rattling noise,\r\nbristled up its spines.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to my amusement, while we were looking at the curious defense\r\nthis creature was making, little Jack stepped close up to it, with a\r\npocket pistol in his hand, and shot it dead, making sure of it by a\r\ncouple of hearty raps on the head, and then giving way to a burst of\r\nboyish exultation, he called upon us to help to convey his prize to his\r\nmother. This it was not by any means easy to do. Sundry attempts\r\nresulted in bloody fingers, till Jack, taking his pocket-handkerchief,\r\nand fastening one corner round its neck, ran off, dragging it after him\r\nto where his mother awaited us.\r\n\r\n`Hullo, mother! Here's a jolly beast, isn't it? I shot it, and it's\r\ngood to eat! Father says so! I only wish you had seen how it terrified\r\nthe dogs, and heard the rattling and rustling of its spines. Oh, it is\r\na fearful creature!'\r\n\r\nErnest, examining it carefully, pronounced its incisor teeth, its ears\r\nand feet, to resemble those of the human race, and pointed out the\r\ncurious crest of stiff hairs on its head and neck.\r\n\r\n`I have read of another species,' said he, `called the tuft-tailed\r\nporcupine, which must be even more curious-looking than this is. It has\r\nshort flat quills, and a scaly tail ending in an extraordinary tuft,\r\nlike a bunch of narrow strips of parchment. It cannot be such a\r\ndisagreeable enemy to encounter as this fellow.'\r\n\r\n`Were you not afraid, Jack,' asked I, `lest the porcupine should cast\r\nsome of his quills like darts at you?'\r\n\r\n`Of course not,' returned he, `I know well enough that is nothing but a\r\nfable!'\r\n\r\n`A fable!' said I, `why look at your mother! She is drawing five or six\r\nspines out of each of the dogs!'\r\n\r\n`Ah, those stuck into them when they so fiercely fell upon it in their\r\nattack. Those are the shortest quills, and seem very slightly fixed in\r\nits skin. The long quills bent aside when Juno pressed against them.'\r\n\r\n`You are perfectly right, my boy,' said I, `there is no truth in the\r\nold idea of shooting out the spines. But now, shall we leave this\r\nprickly booty of yours, or attempt to take it with us?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, please, father, let us take it! Why, it is good to eat!'\r\n\r\nSmiling at the child's eagerness, and willing to please him, I made a\r\nsomewhat awkward bundle of the porcupine, wrapping it in several folds\r\nof cloth, and added it to the donkey's load.\r\n\r\nOur party then resumed the march, which, with little interruption, was\r\ncontinued steadily, until we came in sight of our future place of\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful appearance of the enormous trees, and the calm beauty of\r\nthe spot altogether, fully came up to the enthusiastic description\r\nwhich had been given to me. And my wife gladly heard me say that if an\r\nabode could be contrived among the branches, it would be the safest and\r\nmost charming home in the world.\r\n\r\nWe hastily unloaded the ass and cow, securing them, as well as the\r\nsheep and goats, by tying their fore-feet loosely together.\r\n\r\nThe doves and poultry were set at liberty, and we sat down to rest\r\namong the soft herbage while we laid our plans for the night.\r\n\r\nFritz soon left us, but presently two shots were fired, and he\r\nappeared holding a fine tiger-cat by the hind legs, which, with the\r\nintensest delight, he exhibited to each in turn.\r\n\r\n`Well done, Fritz!' cried I. `Our cocks and hens would have had an\r\nunfortunate night of it but for this lucky shot of yours. It is to be\r\nhoped he has left no companion near at hand. You must be on the\r\nlook-out.'\r\n\r\n`How curious it seems,' remarked Ernest, `that God should create\r\nhurtful animals like this.'\r\n\r\n`To our feeble and narrow vision many of the ways of the Infinite and\r\nEternal Mind are incomprehensible,' I replied. `What our limited reason\r\ncannot grasp, let us be content to acknowledge as the workings of\r\nAlmighty power and wisdom, and thankfully trust in that \"Rock,\" which,\r\nwere it not higher than we, would afford no sense of security to the\r\nimmortal soul.\r\n\r\n`That animals should prey upon one another is a means of preserving a\r\ndue balance in the world of nature. What beautiful and warm furs are\r\nprocured by hunters just in those countries where no other covering\r\nwould defend the inhabitants from the wintery cold!--As, for instance,\r\nthe skins of bears, wolverines, and arctic foxes, wild cats, and many\r\nothers.'\r\n\r\n`The skin of the seal, or sea dog, is also valuable,' said Ernest.\r\n\r\n`It is,' I replied, `and in its own element that creature preys on fish\r\nas the dog did on land animals before his race became domesticated by\r\nman. But now, Fritz, tell us how you obtained your prize.'\r\n\r\n`Observing that something moved among the branches,' said he, `I went\r\nsoftly round the tree with my gun, and making sure the creature was a\r\nwild cat I fired and brought it down. It was severely wounded, but,\r\nrising in a fury, it attempted to climb the tree, when I luckily having\r\na loaded pistol, gave it a quietus. And do tell me, father, what sort\r\nof cat it is.'\r\n\r\n`It is a mercy the brute did not fly at your throat instead of\r\nattempting to escape,' said I. `It belongs to a fierce and\r\nblood-thirsty race--that of the ocelots or tiger-cats, natives of the\r\ntropical parts of America. I should say this was a margay, and as it\r\nwould have proved a cruel foe, not only of our poultry, but also of our\r\nsheep and goats, I am well pleased that you have rid us of it.'\r\n\r\n`May I have the beautiful skin, father? And will you tell me what will\r\nbe the best use to make of it?'\r\n\r\n`I advise you to skin the animal very carefully, and of the handsome\r\nblack and yellow tail, make a hunting-belt for yourself. The paws--let\r\nme see--why, I fancy the paws might be made famous cases for knife,\r\nfork and spoon, and look well hanging from the belt. The skin of the\r\nbody you had better preserve until you find some suitable use for it.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, father, what a splendid plan!' cried Jack. `Do tell me some good\r\nuse for my porcupine.'\r\n\r\n`I think its feet may make cases also; at least, you may try. The\r\nquills, I am sure, may be used for packing needles, and for tipping\r\narrows, and I should try to make defensive armour for the dogs out of\r\nthe rest. They may fall in with foes more dangerous than any we have\r\nyet seen.'\r\n\r\n`To be sure, father, the very thing!' shouted Jack in high glee. `I\r\nhave seen pictures of boar-hunts, in which the dogs were protected by a\r\nsort of leather coat of mail. That will be grand!'\r\n\r\nAfter giving this advice, I got no peace until I had shown my boys how\r\nto act upon it, and in a short time each had his prize fastened up by\r\nthe hind legs, and carefully slitting the skin, was stripping it from\r\nthe carcase.\r\n\r\nErnest, meanwhile, was fetching large flat stones in order to form a\r\nfire-place, while Franz gathered sticks, as his mother was anxious to\r\nprepare some food.\r\n\r\n`What sort of tree do you suppose this to be, father?' inquired\r\nErnest, seeing me examining that under which we were encamping. `Is not\r\nthe leaf something like a walnut?'\r\n\r\n`There is a resemblance, but in my opinion these gigantic trees must be\r\nmangroves or wild figs. I have heard their enormous height described,\r\nand also the peculiarity of the arching roots supporting the main trunk\r\nraised above the soil.'\r\n\r\nJust then little Franz came up with a large bundle of sticks, and his\r\nmouth full of something he was eating with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n`Oh, mother!' cried he, `this is so good! So delicious!'\r\n\r\n`Greedy little boy!' exclaimed she in a fright. `What have you got\r\nthere? Don't swallow it, whatever you do. Very likely it is poisonous!\r\nSpit it all out this minute!' And his anxious mother quickly extracted\r\nfrom the rosy little mouth the remains of a small fig.\r\n\r\n`Where did you find this?' said I.\r\n\r\n`There are thousands lying among the grass yonder,' replied the little\r\nboy. `They taste very nice. I thought poison was nasty. Do you think\r\nthey will hurt me? The pigeons and the hens are gobbling them up with\r\nall their might and main, papa!'\r\n\r\n`I think you have no cause for alarm, dear wife,' I said. `The trees\r\nseem to be the fig-bearing mangrove of the Antilles. But remember,\r\nFranz, you must never eat anything without first showing it to me,\r\nnever mind how good it seems.\r\n\r\n`If birds and monkeys eat a fruit or vegetable, it is usually safe to\r\nbelieve it wholesome,' added I, turning to the other boys, who\r\ninstantly taking the hint, coaxed Franz to give them the figs he still\r\nhad in his pocket, and ran to offer them to Knips, who was closely\r\nwatching the skinning of the tiger-cat and porcupine, apparently giving\r\nhis opinion on the subject with much chattering and gesticulation.\r\n\r\n`Here, Knips, allow me to present you with a fig!' cried Jack, holding\r\none out to the funny little creature.\r\n\r\nKnips took it readily, and after turning it about, and sniffing and\r\nsmelling it, he popped it into his mouth, with such a droll grimace of\r\ndelight and satisfaction that the boys all laughed and clapped their\r\nhands, crying `Bravo, Knips! You know a good thing when you see it,\r\ndon't you, old fellow! Hurrah!'\r\n\r\nMy wife, with her mind set at rest on the question of the figs, now\r\ncontinued her preparations for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the margay was given to the dogs, but part of the\r\nporcupine was put on the fire to boil, while we reserved the rest for\r\nroasting.\r\n\r\nI employed myself in contriving needles for my wife's work, by boring\r\nholes at one end of the quills, which I did by means of a red hot nail,\r\nand I soon had a nice packet of various sizes, which pleased her\r\nimmensely. I also laid plans for making proper harness for our beasts\r\nof burden, but could not attempt to begin that while so many wants more\r\npressing demanded attention.\r\n\r\nWe examined the different trees, and chose one which seemed most\r\nsuited to our purpose. The branches spread at a great height above us,\r\nand I made the boys try if it were possible to throw sticks or stones\r\nover one of these, my intention being to construct a rope ladder if we\r\ncould once succeed in getting a string across a strong bough.\r\n\r\nFinding we could not succeed in that way, I resolved other schemes in\r\nmy mind, and meantime went with Jack and Fritz to a small brook close\r\nby, where I showed them how to place the skins to steep and soften in\r\nthe water, with stones placed on them to keep them beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, I prepared our night quarters. I first slung our\r\nhammocks from the roots of the tree, which, meeting above us, formed an\r\narched roof, then covering the whole with sailcloth, we made a\r\ntemporary tent, which would at least keep off the night damps and\r\nnoxious insects.\r\n\r\nLeaving my wife engaged in making a set of harness for the ass and cow,\r\nwhose strength I intended to employ the following day in drawing the\r\nbeams up to our tree, I walked down with Fritz and Ernest to the beach\r\nto look for wood suitable for building our new abode and also to\r\ndiscover, if possible, some light rods to form a ladder.\r\n\r\nFor some time we hunted in vain, nothing but rough driftwood was to be\r\nseen, utterly unfit for our purpose. Ernest at length pointed out a\r\nquantity of bamboos half buried in the sand. These were exactly what I\r\nwanted, and stripping them of their leaves I cut them into lengths of\r\nabout five feet each; these I bound in bundles to carry to the tree,\r\nand then began to look about for some slight reeds to serve as arrows.\r\n\r\nI presently saw what I required in a copse at a little distance. We\r\nadvanced cautiously lest the thicket should contain some wild beast or\r\nvenomous serpent. Juno rushed ahead; as she did so a flock of\r\nflamingos, which had been quietly feeding, rose in the air. Fritz\r\ninstantly firing brought a couple of the birds to the ground, the rest\r\nof the squadron sailing away in perfect order, their plumage\r\ncontinually changing, as they flew, from beautiful rose to pure white,\r\nas alternately their snowy wings and rosy breasts were visible.\r\n\r\nOne of those which fell was perfectly dead, but the other appeared only\r\nslightly wounded in the wing, for it made off across the swampy ground.\r\nI attempted to follow, but soon found that progress was impossible on\r\nthe marsh; Juno, however, chased the bird and, seizing it, speedily\r\nbrought it to my feet. Fritz and Ernest were delighted at the sight of\r\nour prize.\r\n\r\n`What a handsome bird!' exclaimed they. `Is it much hurt? Let us tame\r\nit and let it run about with the fowls.'\r\n\r\n`Its plumage is much more brilliant than that of the dead one,'\r\nremarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n`Yes,' said Ernest, `this is a full-grown bird, while yours is\r\nyounger; it is some years before they reach perfection. See what long\r\nactive legs it has, like those of a stork, while with its great webbed\r\nfeet it can swim faster than a goose. Earth, air, or water is all the\r\nsame to the flamingo, it is equally at home in any one of the three.'\r\n\r\n`Well,' said Fritz, `let us take the dead one to mother and get her to\r\nintroduce it to the other element and see what it will make of that; if\r\nit is young and tender, as you say, it should make a delicious roast.'\r\n\r\nFritz and Ernest then carried the birds and bamboos to the tree, while\r\nI proceeded to cut my reeds. I chose those which had flowered, knowing\r\nthat they were harder, and having cut a sufficient quantity of these, I\r\nselected one or two of the tallest canes I could find to assist me in\r\nmeasuring the height of the tree. I then bound them together and\r\nreturned to my family.\r\n\r\n`Do you mean to keep this great hungry bird Fritz has brought?' said my\r\nwife. `It is another mouth to feed, remember, and provisions are still\r\nscarce.'\r\n\r\n`Luckily,' I replied, `the flamingo will not eat grain like our\r\npoultry, but will be quite satisfied with insects, fish, and little\r\ncrabs, which it will pick up for itself. Pray reassure yourself,\r\ntherefore, and let me see to the poor bird's wound.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, I procured some wine and butter and anointing the wing,\r\nwhich though hurt was not broken, I bound it up, and then took the bird\r\nto the stream where I fastened it by a long cord to a stake and left it\r\nto shift for itself. In a few days the wound was healed, and the bird,\r\nsubdued by kind treatment, became rapidly tame.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed my sons were endeavouring to ascertain the\r\nheight of the lowest branch of the tree from the ground. They had\r\nfastened together the long reeds I had brought with them, and were\r\ntrying to measure the distance, but in vain; they soon found that were\r\nthe rods ten times their length they could not touch the branch.\r\n\r\n`Hello, my boys,' I said, when I discovered what they were about,\r\n`that is not the way to set to work. Geometry will simplify the\r\noperation considerably; with its help the altitude of the highest\r\nmountains are ascertained; we may, therefore, easily find the height of\r\nthat branch.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, I measured out a certain distance from the base of the tree\r\nand marked the spot, and then by means of a rod, whose length I knew,\r\nand imaginary lines, I calculated the angle subtended by the trunk of\r\nthe tree from the ground to the root of the branch. This done, I was\r\nable to discover the height required, and, to the astonishment of the\r\nyounger children, announced that we should henceforth live thirty feet\r\nabove the ground. This I wanted to know, that I might construct a\r\nladder of the necessary length.\r\n\r\nTelling Fritz to collect all our cord, and the others to roll all the\r\ntwine into a ball, I sat down and taking the reeds, speedily\r\nmanufactured half a dozen arrows and feathered them from the dead\r\nflamingo. I then took a strong bamboo, bent it and strung it so as to\r\nform a bow. When the boys saw what I had done they were delighted, and\r\nbegged to have the pleasure of firing the first shot.\r\n\r\n`No, no!' said I, `I did not make this for mere pleasure, nor is it\r\neven intended as a weapon, the arrows are pointless. Elizabeth,' I\r\ncontinued to my wife, `can you supply me with a ball of stout thread\r\nfrom your wonderful bag?'\r\n\r\n`Certainly,' replied she, `I think that a ball of thread was the first\r\nthing to enter the bag,' and diving her hand deep in, she drew out the\r\nvery thing I wanted.\r\n\r\n`Now, boys,' I said, `I am going to fire the first shot,' and I\r\nfastened one end of the thread to one of my arrows and aimed at a\r\nlarge branch above me. The arrow flew upwards and bore the thread over\r\nthe branch and fell at our feet. Thus was the first step in our\r\nundertaking accomplished. Now for the rope ladder!\r\n\r\nFritz had obtained two coils of cord each about forty feet in length;\r\nthese we stretched on the ground side by side; then Fritz cut the\r\nbamboos into pieces of two feet for the steps of the ladder, and as he\r\nhanded them to me, I passed them through knots which I had prepared in\r\nthe ropes, while Jack fixed each end with a nail driven through the\r\nwood. When the ladder was finished, I carried over the bough a rope by\r\nwhich it might be hauled up. This done, I fixed the lower end of the\r\nladder firmly to the ground by means of stakes, and all was ready for\r\nan ascent. The boys who had been watching me with intense interest were\r\neach eager to be first.\r\n\r\n`Jack shall have the honour,' said I, `as he is the lightest, so up\r\nwith you, my boy, and do not break your neck.'\r\n\r\nJack, who was as active as a monkey, sprang up the ladder and quickly\r\ngained the top.\r\n\r\n`Three cheers for the nest!' he exclaimed, waving his cap.\r\n\r\n`Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for our jolly nest! What a grand house we will\r\nhave up here; come along, Fritz!'\r\n\r\nHis brother was soon by his side, and with a hammer and nails secured\r\nthe ladder yet more securely. I followed with an axe, and took a survey\r\nof the tree. It was admirably suited to our purpose; the branches were\r\nvery strong and so closely interwoven that no beams would be required\r\nto form a flooring, but when some of the boughs were lopped and cleared\r\naway, a few planks would be quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nI now called for a pulley, which my wife fastened to the cord hanging\r\nbeside the ladder, I hauled it up, and finding the boys rather in my\r\nway, told them to go down while I proceeded to fasten the pulley to a\r\nstout branch above me, that we might be able to haul up the beams we\r\nshould require the next day. I then made other preparations that there\r\nmight be no delay on the morrow, and a bright moon having arisen, I by\r\nits light continued working until I was quite worn out, and then at\r\nlength descended.\r\n\r\nI reached the ground, but to my surprise found that the two boys were\r\nnot there. They had not been seen. A moment afterwards, however, all\r\nanxiety was dispelled, for amongst the topmost boughs I heard their\r\nyoung voices raised in the evening hymn.\r\n\r\nInstead of descending, they had, while I was busy, climbed upwards, and\r\nhad been sitting in silent admiration of the moonlight scene, high\r\nabove me. They now joined us, and my wife showed me the results of her\r\nlabour. She had made two complete sets of harness. I congratulated her\r\nupon her success, and we then sat down to supper.\r\n\r\nOn a cloth spread out upon the grass were arranged a roast shoulder of\r\nporcupine, a delicious bowl of soup made from a piece of the same\r\nanimal, cheese, butter, and biscuits, forming a most tempting repast.\r\nHaving done this ample justice, we collected our cattle, and the\r\npigeons and fowls having retired to roost on the neighbouring trees,\r\nand on the steps of our ladder, we made up a glorious fire to keep off\r\nany prowling wild beasts, and ourselves lay down.\r\n\r\nThe children, in spite of the novelty of the hammocks, were quickly\r\nasleep. In vain I tried to follow their example; a thousand anxious\r\nthoughts presented themselves, and as quickly as I dispelled them\r\nothers rose in their place. The night wore on, and I was still awake;\r\nthe fire burned low, and I rose and replenished it with dry fuel. Then\r\nagain I climbed into my hammock, and towards morning fell asleep.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we were astir, and dispersed to our various\r\noccupations. My wife milked the goats and cow, while we gave the\r\nanimals their food, after which we went down to the beach, to collect\r\nmore wood for our building operations.\r\n\r\nTo the larger beams we harnessed the cow and ass, while we ourselves\r\ndragged up the remainder. Fritz and I then ascended the tree, and\r\nfinished the preparations I had begun the night before; all useless\r\nboughs we lopped off, leaving a few about six feet from the floor, from\r\nwhich we might sling our hammocks, and others still higher, to support\r\na temporary roof of sailcloth.\r\n\r\nMy wife made fast the planks to a rope passed through the block I had\r\nfixed to the bough above us, and by this means Fritz and I hauled them\r\nup. These we arranged side by side on the foundation of boughs, so as\r\nto form a smooth solid floor, and round this platform built a bulwark\r\nof planks, and then throwing the sailcloth over the higher branches, we\r\ndrew it down and firmly nailed it. Our house was thus enclosed on three\r\nsides, for behind the great trunk protected us, while the front was\r\nleft open to admit the fresh sea breeze which blew directly in.\r\n\r\nWe then hauled up our hammocks and bedding and slung them from the\r\nbranches we had left for that purpose. A few hours of daylight still\r\nremaining, we cleared the floor from leaves and chips, and then\r\ndescended to fashion a table and a few benches from the remainder of\r\nthe wood. After working like slaves all day, Fritz and I flung\r\nourselves on the grass, while my wife arranged supper on the table we\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\n`Come,' said she at length, `come and taste flamingo stew, and tell me\r\nhow you like it. Ernest assured me that it would be much better stewed\r\nthan roasted, and I have been following his directions.'\r\n\r\nLaughing at the idea of Ernest turning scientific cook we sat down. The\r\nfowls gathered round us to pick up the crumbs, and the tame flamingo\r\njoined them, while Master Knips skipped about from one to the other,\r\nchattering and mimicking our gestures continually.\r\n\r\nTo my wife's joy, the sow appeared shortly after, and was presented\r\nwith all the milk that remained from the day's stock that she might be\r\npersuaded to return every night.\r\n\r\n`For,' said my wife, `this surplus milk is really of no use to us, as\r\nit will be sour before the morning in this hot climate.'\r\n\r\n`You are quite right,' I replied, `but we must contrive to make it of\r\nuse. The next time Fritz and I return to the wreck we will bring off a\r\nchurn amongst the other things we require.'\r\n\r\n`Must you really go again to that dreadful wreck?' said my wife\r\nshuddering. `You have no idea how anxious I am when you are away\r\nthere.'\r\n\r\n`Go we must, I am afraid,' I replied, `but not for a day or two yet.\r\nCome, it is getting late. We and the chickens must go to roost.'\r\n\r\nWe lit our watch fires, and, leaving the dogs on guard below, ascended\r\nthe ladder. Fritz, Ernest and Jack were up in a moment.\r\n\r\nTheir mother followed very cautiously, for though she had originated\r\nthe idea of building a nest, she yet hesitated to entrust herself at\r\nsuch a terrific height from the ground. When she was safely landed in\r\nthe house, taking little Franz on my back, I let go the fastenings\r\nwhich secured the lower end of the ladder to the ground, and swinging\r\nto and fro, slowly ascended.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time we stood all together in our new home. I drew\r\nup the ladder, and, with a greater sense of security than I had enjoyed\r\nsince we landed on the island, offered up our evening prayer, and\r\nretired for the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nNext morning all were early awake, and the children sprang about the\r\ntree like young monkeys.\r\n\r\n`What shall we begin to do, father?' they cried. `What do you want us\r\nto do, today?'\r\n\r\n`Rest, my boys,' I replied, `rest.'\r\n\r\n`Rest?' repeated they. `Why should we rest?'\r\n\r\n`\"Six days shalt thou labour and do all that thou hast to do, but on\r\nthe seventh, thou shalt do no manner of work.\" This is the seventh\r\nday,' I replied, `on it, therefore, let us rest.'\r\n\r\n`What, is it really Sunday?' said Jack, `How jolly! Oh, I won't do any\r\nwork; but I'll take a bow and arrow and shoot, and we'll climb about\r\nthe tree and have fun all day.'\r\n\r\n`That is not resting,' said I, `that is not the way you are accustomed\r\nto spend the Lord's day.'\r\n\r\n`No! But then we can't go to church here, and there is nothing else to\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n`We can worship here as well as at home,' said I.\r\n\r\n`But there is no church, no clergyman and no organ,' said Franz.\r\n\r\n`The leafy shade of this great tree is far more beautiful than any\r\nchurch,' I said, `there will we worship our Creator. Come, boys, down\r\nwith you: turn our dining hall into a breakfast room.'\r\n\r\nThe children, one by one, slipped down the ladder.\r\n\r\n`My dear Elizabeth,' said I, `this morning we will devote to the\r\nservice of the Lord, and by means of a parable, I will endeavor to give\r\nthe children some serious thought; but, without books, or the\r\npossibility of any of the usual Sunday occupations, we cannot keep them\r\nquiet the whole day; afterward, therefore I shall allow them to pursue\r\nany innocent recreation they choose, and in the cool of the evening we\r\nwill take a walk.'\r\n\r\nMy wife entirely agreed with my proposal, and having breakfasted, the\r\nfamily assembled round me, as we sat in the pleasant shade on the\r\nfresh, soft grass.\r\n\r\nAfter singing some hymns and offering heartfelt prayers to the\r\nAlmighty Giver of all good, I told the children I would relate to them\r\na parable instead of preaching a sermon.\r\n\r\n`Oh, that would be delightful! I like the parables in the Bible better\r\nthan anything,' said Franz. `When can we hear you read out of the Bible\r\nagain, father?'\r\n\r\n`Ah, my little boy, your words reproach me,' returned I. `While\r\neagerly striving to procure from the ship would feed our bodies and\r\nprovide for their comfort, I blush to think that I have neglected the\r\nBread of Life, the word of God. I shall search for a Bible on my next\r\nreturn to the wreck: although our own books were nearly all destroyed,\r\nI am pretty sure to find one.'\r\n\r\nAt these words my wife arose, and fetching her magic bag, she drew from\r\nit a copy of the Holy Scriptures, which I thankfully received from her\r\nhand; and after reading aloud from its sacred pages, I spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n`A Great King, ruling in power and splendor over a vast realm of light\r\nand love, possessed within its boundaries a desolate and unfruitful\r\nisland. This spot he made the object of his special care; and,\r\nlavishing on it all the varied resources of his might and goodness, it\r\nbloomed in beauty, and became the happy residence of a band of\r\ncolonists, who were charged not only with the cultivation and\r\nimprovement of the soil, but each, individually, was bound to cherish\r\nin his soul the spirit of love and true allegiance to his Sovereign.\r\n\r\n`While this faithful union was maintained, the colony flourished; and\r\nthe noblest virtues exalted and rendered happy the existence of every\r\nmember of the race.\r\n\r\n`That a discontented and rebellious spirit should ever have infected\r\nthese fortunate subjects of so loving a master, seems incredible, yet\r\nit was so; disobedience and pride brought misery and punishment, the\r\nfair prospects of the colony were blighted, the labours of the\r\ncolonists were unblessed, and total separation from the parent kingdom\r\nseemed inevitable.\r\n\r\n`A message of pardon--of free forgiveness--was nevertheless accorded to\r\nthese rebels; and to all who, humbly accepting it, molded their future\r\nlives to the will of the Great King (now revealed in a character even\r\nmore gracious than before), was held out the promise of removal at last\r\nfrom among the ruins caused by the great rebellion, to the glory and\r\nundimmed splendor of the realm of Light and Blessedness.'\r\n\r\nHaving interested the children, I then, leaving allegory, pressed\r\nsimply and earnestly home to each young heart the truths I sought to\r\nteach; and, with a short prayer for a blessing on my words, brought the\r\nservice to a close.\r\n\r\nAfter a thoughtful pause, we separated, and each employed himself as he\r\nfelt disposed.\r\n\r\nI took some arrows, and endeavoured to point them with porcupine\r\nquills.\r\n\r\nFranz came to beg me make a little bow and arrow for him to shoot\r\nwith, while Fritz asked my advice about the tiger-cat skin and the\r\ncases he was to contrive from it. Jack assisted with the arrow-making,\r\nand inserting a sharp spine at one end of each reed made it fast with\r\npack-thread, and began to wish for glue to ensure its remaining firm.\r\n\r\n`Oh, Jack! Mamma's soup is as sticky as anything!' cried Franz. `Shall\r\nI run and ask for a cake of it?'\r\n\r\n`No, no, little goose! Better look for some real glue in the\r\ntool-box.'\r\n\r\n`There he will find glue, to be sure,' said I, `and the soup would\r\nscarcely have answered your purpose. But Jack, my boy, I do not like to\r\nhear you ridicule your little brother's idea. Some of the most valuable\r\ndiscoveries have been the result of thoughts which originally appeared\r\nno wiser than his.'\r\n\r\nWhile thus directing and assisting my sons, we were surprised by\r\nhearing a shot just over heads; at the same moment two small birds fell\r\ndead at our feet, and looking up, we beheld Ernest among the branches,\r\nas bending his face joyfully towards us, he cried, `Well hit! Well hit!\r\nA good shot, wasn't it?'\r\n\r\nThen slipping down the ladder, and picking up the birds, he brought\r\nthem to me. One was a kind of thrush, the other a small dove called the\r\nortolan, and esteemed a very great delicacy on account of its exquisite\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nAs the figs on which these birds came to feed were only just beginning\r\nto ripen, it was probable that they would soon flock in numbers to our\r\ntrees; and by waiting until we could procure them in large quantities,\r\nwe might provide ourselves with valuable food for the rainy season, by\r\nplacing them, when half cooked, in casks with melted lard or butter\r\npoured over them.\r\n\r\nBy this time Jack had pointed a good supply of arrows, and\r\nindustriously practised archery. I finished the bow and arrows for\r\nFranz, and expected to be left in peace; but the young man next\r\ndemanded a quiver, and I had to invent that also, to complete his\r\nequipment. It was easily done by stripping a piece of bark from a small\r\ntree, fitting a flat side and a bottom to it, and then a string.\r\nAttaching it to his shoulders, the youthful hunter filled it with\r\narrows and went off; looking, as his mother said, like an innocent\r\nlittle Cupid, bent on conquest.\r\n\r\nNot long after this, we were summoned to dinner, and all right\r\nwillingly obeyed the call.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal I interested the boys very much by proposing to decide\r\non suitable names for the different spots we had visited on this coast.\r\n\r\n`For,' said I, `it will become more and more troublesome to explain\r\nwhat we mean, unless we do so. Besides which, we shall feel much more\r\nat home if we can talk as people do in inhabited countries: instead of\r\nsaying, for instance, \"the little island at the mouth of our bay, where\r\nwe found the dead shark\", \"the large stream near our tent, across which\r\nwe made the bridge\", \"that wood where we found cocoanuts, and caught\r\nthe monkey\", and so on. Let us begin by naming the bay in which we\r\nlanded. What shall we call it?'\r\n\r\n`Oyster Bay,' said Fritz.\r\n\r\n`No, no!--Lobster Bay,' cried Jack, `in memory of the old fellow who\r\ntook a fancy to my leg!'\r\n\r\n`I think,' observed his mother, `that, in token of gratitude for our\r\nescape, we should call it Safety Bay.'\r\n\r\nThis name met with general approbation, and was forthwith fixed upon.\r\n\r\nOther names were quickly chosen. Our first place of abode we called\r\nTentholm; the islet in the bay, Shark's Island; and the reedy swamp,\r\nFlamingo Marsh. It was some time before the serious question of a name\r\nfor our leafy castle could be decided. But finally it was entitled\r\nFalconhurst; and we then rapidly named the few remaining points:\r\nProspect Hill, the eminence we first ascended; Cape Disappointment,\r\nfrom whose rocky heights we had strained our eyes in vain search for\r\nour ship's company; and Jackal River, as a name for the large stream at\r\nour landing place, concluded our geographical nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the boys went on with their various employments.\r\nFritz finished his cases, and Jack asked my assistance in carrying out\r\nhis plan of making a cuirass for Turk, out of the porcupine skin. After\r\nthoroughly cleansing the inside, we cut and fitted it round the body of\r\nthe patient dog; then when strings were sewn on, and it became\r\ntolerably dry, he was armed with this ingenious coat of mail, and a\r\nmost singular figure he cut!\r\n\r\nJuno strongly objected to his friendly approaches, and got out of his\r\nway so fast as she could; and it was clear that he would easily put to\r\nflight the fiercest animal he might encounter, while protected by\r\narmour at once defensive and offensive. I determined to make also a\r\nhelmet for Jack out of the remainder of the skin, which to his infinite\r\ndelight I speedily did.\r\n\r\nAmid these interesting occupations the evening drew on, and after a\r\npleasant walk among the sweet glades near our abode, we closed our\r\nSabbath day with prayer and a glad hymn of praise, retiring to rest\r\nwith peaceful hearts.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I proposed an expedition to Tentholm, saying I wished to\r\nmake my way thither by a different route. We left the tree well armed;\r\nI and my three elder sons each carrying a gun and game-bag, while\r\nlittle Franz was equipped with his bow and quiver full of arrows. A\r\nmost curious party we formed: Fritz adorned with his belt of margay\r\nskin, and Jack, with his extraordinary headdress, looked like a couple\r\nof young savages.\r\n\r\nTheir mother and I walked together; she, of the whole party, being the\r\nonly one unarmed, carried a jar in which to get butter from Tentholm;\r\nwe were preceded by the dogs Turk armed most effectually with his\r\ncuirass of porcupine skin, and Juno keeping at a respectful distance\r\nfrom so formidable a companion.\r\n\r\nMaster Knips fully intended to mount his charger as usual; but when he\r\nsaw him arrayed apparently in a new skin, he approached him carefully,\r\nand touching him with one paw, discovered that such a hide would make\r\nanything but an agreeable seat; the grimace he made was most comical,\r\nand chattering vociferously he bounded towards Juno, skipped on her\r\nback, seated himself, and soon appeared perfectly reconciled to the\r\nchange of steed.\r\n\r\nThe flamingo saw us starting, and, having been much petted during the\r\nlast day or two, considered himself entitled to accompany us; for some\r\ntime he kept beside the children, following first one and then another\r\nas they explored the wood on either side; their irregular course,\r\nhowever, at length disgusted him, and, abandoning them, he walked\r\nsedately by my side.\r\n\r\nWe strolled on in the cool evening air, following the course of the\r\nstream. The boys roamed ahead of me, intent on exploration.\r\n\r\nPresently I heard a joyful shout, and saw Ernest running at full speed\r\ntowards me, followed by his brothers. In his hand he held a plant, and,\r\npanting for breath, and with sparkling eyes, he held it up to me.\r\n\r\n`Potatoes! Potatoes, father,' he gasped out.\r\n\r\n`Yes,' said Jack, `acres and acres of potatoes!'\r\n\r\n`My dear Ernest,' said I, for there was no mistaking the flower and\r\nleaf, and the light clear-green bulbous roots, `you have indeed made a\r\ndiscovery; with the potato we shall never starve.'\r\n\r\n`But come and look at them,' said Jack, `come and feast your eyes on\r\nthousands of potatoes.'\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the spot: there, spread out before us, was a great tract\r\nof ground, covered with the precious plant.\r\n\r\n`It would have been rather difficult,' remarked Jack, `not to have\r\ndiscovered such a great field.'\r\n\r\n`Very likely,' replied Ernest, smiling, `but I doubt if you would have\r\ndiscovered that it was a potato field.'\r\n\r\n`Perhaps not,' said Jack, `you are quite welcome, at all events, to the\r\nhonour of the discovery; I'll have the honour of being the first to get\r\na supply of them.' So saying, he dug up, with hands and knife, a number\r\nof plants, and filled his game-bag with the roots. The monkey followed\r\nhis example, and scratching away with his paws most cleverly, soon had\r\na heap beside him. So delighted were we with the discovery, and so\r\neager were we to possess a large supply of the roots, that we stopped\r\nnot digging until every bag, pouch and pocket was filled.\r\n\r\nSome wished to return at once to Falconhurst, to cook and taste our new\r\nacquisition; but this I overruled, and we continued our march, heavily\r\nladen, but delighted.\r\n\r\n`How,' said I, `can we thank the Giver of all these blessings,\r\nsufficiently?'\r\n\r\n`Oh,' said Franz, `we can say, \"We thank thee, O Lord, for all thy\r\ngoodness and mercy; and bless us for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.\"'\r\n\r\n`That would not be sufficient,' said Fritz. `Do you think it would be\r\nenough just to say to father and mother: \"Thank you for all you do,\"\r\nand not to show that we were really thankful, by loving them and doing\r\nwhat we can to please them?'\r\n\r\n`You are quite right, Fritz,' said I; `Franz did not say all that was\r\nnecessary, he should have added, \"Give me grace to do Thy will, and to\r\nobey Thee in all things.\"'\r\n\r\nAs we thus talked, we reached the head of our streamlet, where it fell\r\nfrom the rocks above in a beautiful, sparkling, splashing cascade. We\r\ncrossed and entered the tall grass on the other side.\r\n\r\nWe forced our way through with difficulty, so thick and tangled were\r\nthe reeds. Beyond this, the landscape was most lovely. Rich tropical\r\nvegetation flourished on every side: the tall stately palms, surrounded\r\nby luxuriant ferns; brilliant flowers and graceful creepers; the\r\nprickly cactus, shooting up amidst them; aloe, jasmine and\r\nsweet-scented vanilla; the Indian pea and, above all, the regal\r\npineapple*, loaded the breath of the evening breeze with their rich\r\nperfume. The boys were delighted with the pineapple, and so eagerly did\r\nthey fall to, that my wife had to caution them that there were no\r\ndoctors on our territory, and that if they became ill, they would have\r\nto cure themselves as best they might.\r\n\r\n   * At this point the author seems to assume that pineapples\r\n     grow on trees. They do not.\r\n\r\nThis advice, however, seemed to have small effect on my sons, and\r\nshowing Knips what they wanted, they sent him after the ripest and best\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus employed, I examined the other shrubs and bushes.\r\nAmong these I presently noticed one which I knew well from description\r\nto be the karatas.\r\n\r\n`Come here, boys,' I said, `here is something of far more value than\r\nyour pineapples. Do you see that plant with long pointed leaves and\r\nbeautiful red flower? That is the karatas. The filaments of the leaves\r\nmake capital thread, while the leaves themselves, bruised, form an\r\ninvaluable salve. The pith of this wonderful plant may be used either\r\nfor tinder or bait for fish.\r\n\r\n`Suppose, Ernest, you had been wrecked here, how would you have made a\r\nfire without matches, or flint and steel?'\r\n\r\n`As the savages do,' replied he, `I would rub two pieces of wood\r\ntogether until they kindled.'\r\n\r\n`Try it,' I said, `but, if you please, try it when you have a whole day\r\nbefore you, and no other work to be done, for I am certain it would be\r\nnight before you accomplished the feat. But see here,' and I broke a\r\ndry twig from the karatas, and peeling off the bark, laid the pith upon\r\na stone. I struck a couple of pebbles over it, and, they emitting a\r\nspark, the pith caught fire.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted with the experiment. I then drew some of the\r\nthreads from the leaves, and presented them to my wife.\r\n\r\n`But what,' said Fritz, `is the use of all these other prickly plants,\r\nexcept to annoy one? Here, for instance, is a disagreeable little\r\ntree.'\r\n\r\n`That is an Indian fig,' said I. `It grows best on dry, rocky ground;\r\nfor most of its nourishment is derived from the air. Its juice is used,\r\nI believe, medicinally, while its fruit is pleasant and wholesome.'\r\n\r\nMaster Jack was off in a moment when he heard of a new delicacy, and\r\nattempted to gather some of the fruit, but in vain; the sharp thorns\r\ndefied his efforts, and with bleeding hands and rueful countenance, he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nI removed the thorns from his hands, and making a sharp wooden skewer,\r\nI thrust it into a fig, and quickly twisted it from its branch and\r\nsplit it open with a knife, still holding it upon the skewer. The rest\r\nfollowed my example, and we regaled ourselves upon the fruit, which we\r\nfound excellent.\r\n\r\nErnest carefully examined the fig he was eating. `What', he exclaimed,\r\npresently, `are these little red insects? They cling all over the\r\nfruit, and I cannot shake them off. Can they be cochineal?'\r\n\r\nHe handed me the fig, and I examined it attentively.\r\n\r\n`You are quite right, my boy,' I said, `there is no doubt this is the\r\nreal cochineal. However, though it is worth its weight in gold to\r\nEuropean traders, it is of little use to us, I am afraid, unless any of\r\nyou care to appear in gay colours. The cochineal, you know, forms the\r\nmost lovely scarlet dye.'\r\n\r\n`No, thank you,' said Jack, `but we will take a lot of it when we go\r\nhome again. Now let us find something more useful to us.' And they\r\nthereupon plied me incessantly with questions concerning every plant\r\nand shrub we passed.\r\n\r\n`Stop, stop,' I said at length. `The most learned naturalist would be\r\nmuch puzzled with many of these trees; and I, who have never seen any\r\nof them before, and know them merely by description, cannot pretend to\r\ntell you the names, or explain to you the use of one quarter of them.'\r\n\r\nDiscussing, however, the properties of such shrubs as I did know, we at\r\nlength reached Tentholm. Everything was safe, and we set to work to\r\ncollect what we wanted. I opened the butter cask from which my wife\r\nfilled her pot. Fritz saw after the ammunition, and Jack and Ernest ran\r\ndown to the beach to capture the geese and ducks. This they found no\r\neasy matter, for the birds, left so long alone, were shy, and nothing\r\nwould induce them to come on shore and be caught. Ernest at length hit\r\nupon an ingenious plan.\r\n\r\nHe took some pieces of cheese, and tied them to long strings. This bait\r\nhe threw into the water, and the hungry ducks instantly made a grab at\r\nit; then with a little skilful manoeuvring he drew them on shore.\r\n\r\nWhile Jack and he were thus busily employed catching and tying the\r\nrebels together by the feet, we procured a fresh supply of salt, which\r\nwe packed upon Turk's back, first relieving him of his coat of mail.\r\nThe birds we fastened to our game-bags, and carefully closing the door\r\nof our tent, started homewards by the sea-shore. After a cheerful and\r\npleasant walk, we once more reached our woodland abode. I released the\r\nbirds, and, clipping their wings to prevent their leaving us,\r\nestablished them on the stream. Then, after a delicious supper of\r\npotatoes, milk and butter, we ascended our tree and turned in.\r\n\r\nHaving remarked a great deal of driftwood on the sands the preceding\r\nevening, it occurred to me that it would be well to get some of it, and\r\nmake a kind of sledge, so that the labour of fetching what we wanted\r\nfrom our stores at Tentholm might not fall so heavily on ourselves.\r\n\r\nI awoke early and roused Ernest as my assistant, wishing to encourage\r\nhim to overcome his natural fault of indolence. After a little\r\nstretching and yawning, he got up cheerfully, pleased with the idea of\r\nan expedition while the others still slept, and we made our way to the\r\nbeach, taking with us the donkey, who drew a large broad bough, which I\r\nexpected to find useful in bringing back our load.\r\n\r\nAs we went along, I remarked to Ernest that I supposed he was rather\r\nsorry for himself, and grudged leaving his cosy hammock and pleasant\r\ndreams at this untimely hour.\r\n\r\n`Oh, father, do not laugh at my laziness! Indeed I mean to cure myself\r\nof it. I am very glad to go with you. I intended to shoot some more of\r\nthe ortolans this morning, but there will be plenty of time afterwards.\r\nThe boys will be shooting at them, I daresay, but I don't expect they\r\nwill have any great luck.'\r\n\r\n`Why not, pray?' inquired I.\r\n\r\n`I don't believe they will know what shot to use at first, and,\r\nbesides, they will most likely shoot upwards at the birds and be sure\r\nto miss them, on account of the great height and thickness of the\r\nbranches and foliage.'\r\n\r\n`Well, Ernest, you certainly possess the gifts of prudence and\r\nreflection, as well as observation. These are valuable; but sudden\r\naction is so often necessary in life, that I advise you to cultivate\r\nthe power of instantly perceiving and deciding what must be done in\r\ncases of emergency. Presence of mind is a precious quality, which,\r\nalthough natural in some characters, may be acquired to a certain\r\ndegree by all who train themselves to it.'\r\n\r\nOnce on the seashore, our work was quickly accomplished, for selecting\r\nthe wood I thought fit for my purpose, we laid it across the broad\r\nleafy branch, and, with some help from us, the donkey dragged a very\r\nfair load of it homewards, with the addition of a small chest which I\r\nraised from among the sand which nearly covered it.\r\n\r\nWe heard the boys popping away at the birds as we drew near. They\r\nhastened to meet us, and inquired where we had been, looking curiously\r\nat the chest, which I allowed them to open, while I asked my wife to\r\nexcuse our `absence without leave'; and after submitting to her gentle\r\nreprimand, I explained my plan for a sledge, which pleased her greatly,\r\nand she already imagined it loaded with her hogshead of butter, and on\r\nits way from Tentholm to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nThe chest proved to be merely that of a common sailor, containing his\r\nclothes, very much wetted by the sea water.\r\n\r\nThe boys exhibited an array of several dozen birds, and related,\r\nduring breakfast, the various incidents of failure and success which\r\nhad attended their guns. Ernest had rightly guessed the mistakes they\r\nwould make, but practise was making them perfect, and they seemed\r\ndisposed to continue their sport, when their mother, assuring them that\r\nshe could not use more birds than those already killed, asked if I did\r\nnot think some means of snaring them might be contrived, as much powder\r\nand shot would be expended if they fired on at this rate.\r\n\r\nEntirely agreeing with this view of the subject, I desired the lads to\r\nlay aside their guns for the present, and the younger ones readily\r\napplied themselves to making snares of the long threads drawn from the\r\nleaves of the karatas in a simple way I taught them, while Fritz and\r\nErnest gave me substantial assistance in the manufacture of the new\r\nsledge.\r\n\r\nWe were busily at work, when a tremendous disturbance among our fowls\r\nled us to suppose that a fox or wild cat had got into their midst. The\r\ncocks crowed defiantly, the hens fluttered and cackled in a state of\r\nthe wildest excitement.\r\n\r\nWe hastened towards them, but Ernest remarking Master Knips slipping\r\naway, as though conscious of some misdemeanour, went to watch him, and\r\npresently caught him in the act of eating a new-laid egg, which he had\r\ncarried off and hidden among the grass and roots. Ernest found several\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThese were very welcome to my wife, for hitherto the hens had not\r\npresented us with any eggs. Hereafter she determined to imprison the\r\nmonkey every morning until the eggs had been collected.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, as Jack was setting the newly made snares among the\r\nbranches, he discovered that a pair of our own pigeons were building in\r\nthe tree. It was very desirable to increase our stock of these pretty\r\nbirds, and I cautioned the boys against shooting near our tree while\r\nthey had nests there, and also with regard to the snares, which were\r\nmeant only to entrap the wild-fig-eaters.\r\n\r\nAlthough my sons were interested in setting the snares, they by no\r\nmeans approved of the new order to economize on ammunition.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they had been discussing this hardship, for little Franz came\r\nto me with a brilliant proposal of his own.\r\n\r\n`Papa,' said he, `why should not we begin to plant some powder and shot\r\nimmediately? It would be so much more useful than bare grain for the\r\nfowls.'\r\n\r\nHis brothers burst into a roar of laughter, and I must confess I found\r\nit no easy matter to keep my countenance.\r\n\r\n`Come, Ernest,' said I, `now we have had our amusement, tell the\r\nlittle fellow what gunpowder really is.'\r\n\r\n`It is not seed at all, Franz,' Ernest explained. `Gunpowder is made of\r\ncharcoal, sulphur and saltpetre, mixed cleverly together; so you see it\r\ncannot be sown like corn, any more than shot can be planted like peas\r\nand beans.'\r\n\r\nMy carpentering meantime went on apace. In order to shape my sledge\r\nwith ends properly turned up in front, I had chosen wood which had been\r\npart of the bow of the vessel, and was curved in the necessary way for\r\nmy purpose. Two pieces, perfectly similar, formed the sides of my\r\nsleigh, or sledge, and I simply united these strongly by fixing short\r\nbars across them. Then, when the ropes of the donkey's harness were\r\nattached to the raised points in front, the equipage was complete and\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nMy attention had been for some time wholly engrossed by my work, and I\r\nonly now observed that the mother and her little boys had been busily\r\nplucking above two dozen of the wild birds, and were preparing to roast\r\nthem, spitted in a row on a long, narrow sword blade, belonging to one\r\nof our ship's officers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed somewhat wasteful to cook so many at once, but my wife\r\nexplained that she was getting them ready for the butter-cask I was\r\ngoing to fetch for her on the new sledge, as I had advised her to\r\npreserve them half-cooked, and packed in butter.\r\n\r\nAmused at her promptitude, I could do nothing less than promise to go\r\nfor her cask directly after dinner. For her part, she resolved in our\r\nabsence to have a grand wash of linen and other clothes, and she\r\nadvised me to arrange regular baths for all the boys in future.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon Ernest and I were ready to be off. Fritz\r\npresented us each with a neat case of margay skin to hang at our\r\ngirdles.\r\n\r\nWe harnessed both cow and ass to the sledge and, accompanied by Juno,\r\ncheerfully took our departure, choosing the way by the sands, and\r\nreaching Tentholm without accident or adventure.\r\n\r\nThere, unharnessing the animals, we began at once to load the sledge,\r\nnot only with the butter-cask, but with a powder-chest, a barrel of\r\ncheese, and a variety of other articles--ball, shot, tools and Turk's\r\narmour, which had been left behind on our last visit.\r\n\r\nOur work had so closely engaged our attention, that when we were ready\r\nto leave it and go in search of a good bathing-place, we discovered\r\nthat our two animals had wandered quite out of sight, having crossed\r\nthe bridge to reach the good pasture beyond the river.\r\n\r\nI sent Ernest after them, and went alone to the extremity of the bay.\r\nIt terminated in bold and precipitous cliffs, which extended into the\r\ndeep water, and rose abruptly so as to form an inaccessible wall of\r\nrock and crag. Swampy ground, overgrown with large canes, intervened\r\nbetween me and these cliffs. I cut a large bundle of the reeds, and\r\nreturned to Ernest.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before I found him, comfortably extended full length\r\non the ground near the tent, and sleeping as sound as a top, while the\r\ncow and the ass, grazing at will, were again making for the bridge.\r\n\r\n`Get up, Ernest, you lazy fellow!' exclaimed I, much annoyed, `Why\r\ndon't you mind your business? Look at the animals! They will be over\r\nthe river again!'\r\n\r\n`No fear of that, father,' returned he, with the utmost composure. `I\r\nhave taken a couple of boards off the bridge. They won't pass the gap.'\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ingenious device by which the boy had\r\nspared himself all trouble; at the same time I observed that it is\r\nwrong to waste the precious moments in sleep when duty has to be\r\nperformed. I then bid him go and collect some salt, which was wanted at\r\nhome, while I went to bathe.\r\n\r\nOn coming back, much refreshed, I again missed Ernest, and began to\r\nwonder whether he was still gathering salt, or whether he had lain down\r\nsomewhere to finish his nap, when I heard him loudly calling: `Father,\r\nfather! I've caught a fish! An immense fellow he is. I can scarcely\r\nhold him, he drags the line so!'\r\n\r\nHastening towards the spot, I saw the boy lying in the grass, on a\r\npoint of land close to the mouth of the stream, and with all his might\r\nkeeping hold of a rod. The line was strained to the utmost by the\r\nfrantic efforts of a very large fish, which was attempting to free\r\nitself from the hook.\r\n\r\nI quickly took the rod from him, and giving the fish more line, led him\r\nby degrees into shallow water. Ernest ran in with his hatchet and\r\nkilled him. It proved to be a salmon of full fifteen pounds weight, and\r\nI was delighted to think of taking such a valuable prize to them.\r\n\r\n`This is capital, Ernest!' cried I. `You have cleared yourself for once\r\nof the charge of laziness! Let us now carry this splendid salmon to the\r\nsledge. I will clean and pack it for the journey, that it may arrive in\r\ngood condition, while you go and take a bath in the sea.'\r\n\r\nAll this being accomplished, we harnessed our beasts to the well-laden\r\nvehicle, and replacing the boards on the bridge, commenced the journey\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWe kept inland this time, and were skirting the borders of a grassy\r\nthicket, when Juno suddenly left us, and plunging into the bushes, with\r\nfierce barking hunted out, right in front of us, the most\r\nsingular-looking creature I ever beheld. It was taking wonderful flying\r\nleaps, apparently in a sitting posture, and got over the ground at an\r\nastonishing rate. I attempted to shoot it as it passed, but missed.\r\n\r\nErnest, who was behind me, observed its movements very coolly, and\r\nseeing that the dog was puzzled, and that the animal, having paused,\r\nwas crouching among the grass, went cautiously nearer, fired at the\r\nspot he had marked, and shot it dead.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary appearance of this creature surprised us very much.\r\nIt was as large as a sheep, its head was shaped like that of a mouse;\r\nits skin also was of a mouse-colour; it had long ears like a hare, and\r\na tail like a tiger's. The fore-paws resembled those of a squirrel, but\r\nthey seemed only half-grown while the hind legs were enormous, and so\r\nlong, that when upright on them the animal would look as if mounted on\r\nstilts.\r\n\r\nFor some time we stood silently wondering at the remarkable creature\r\nbefore us. I could not recollect to have seen or heard of any such.\r\n\r\n`Well, father,' said Ernest at last, `I should say this was about the\r\nqueerest beast to be met with anywhere. I am glad I knocked it over.\r\nHow they will all stare when I carry it home!'\r\n\r\n`You have had a lucky day altogether, certainly,' said I, `but I\r\ncannot think what this animal can be. Examine its teeth, and let us see\r\nto what class of mammalia it belongs. We may be led to guess at its\r\nname in that way.'\r\n\r\n`I see four sharp incisor teeth, father--two upper, and two under, as a\r\nsquirrel has.'\r\n\r\n`Ah! Then he is a rodent. What rodents can you remember, Ernest?'\r\n\r\n`I do not know them all, but there are the mouse, the marmot, the\r\nsquirrel, the hare, the beaver, the jerboa--'\r\n\r\n`The jerboa!' I exclaimed, `The jerboa! Now we shall have it. This is\r\nreally very like a jerboa, only far larger. It must be a kangaroo, one\r\nof the class of animals which has a pouch or purse beneath the body, in\r\nwhich its young can take refuge. They were discovered in New Holland,\r\nby the great Captain Cook, and I congratulate you on being the first to\r\nobtain a specimen in New Switzerland!' I added, laughing, as I\r\nextemporised the name.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo was added to the already heavy load on our sledge, and we\r\nproceeded slowly, arriving late at Falconhurst, but meeting with the\r\nusual bright welcome. Very eager and inquisitive were the glances\r\nturned towards the sledge, for the load piled on it surpassed all\r\nexpectation: we on our part staring in equal surprise at the\r\nextraordinary rig of the young folks who came to meet us.\r\n\r\nOne wore a long night-shirt, which, with a belt, was a convenient\r\nlength in front, but trailed behind in orthodox ghost fashion. Another\r\nhad on a very wide pair of trousers, braced up so short that each\r\nlittle leg looked like the clapper in a bell. The third, buttoned up in\r\na pea-jacket which came down to his ankles, looked for all the world\r\nlike a walking portmanteau.\r\n\r\nAmid much joking and laughter, my wife explained that she had been\r\nwashing all day, and while their clothes were drying, the boys amused\r\nthemselves by dressing up in things they found while rummaging the\r\nsailor's chest, and had kept them on, that Ernest and I might see the\r\nmasquerade. It certainly amused us, but made me regret that so little\r\nbelonging to ourselves had been saved from the wreck, in consequence of\r\nwhich the children had scarcely a change of linen.\r\n\r\nTurning now to our new acquisitions, we excited great interest by\r\nexhibiting each in turn; the large salmon, but more especially the\r\nkangaroo, surprised and delighted everyone.\r\n\r\nFritz alone wore a look expressive of dissatisfaction, and I saw that\r\nhe was envious of his younger brother's success. Vexed that so noble a\r\nprize had fallen to Ernest's gun, instead of his own, he treated it\r\nrather slightingly; but I could see that he was struggling against his\r\njealous feelings, and he, after a while, succeeded in recovering his\r\ngood humour, and joined pleasantly in the conversation.\r\n\r\n`What a famous day's sport you have had altogether!' said he, coming\r\nclose up to me. `It will be my turn to go out with you next, will it\r\nnot, father? Just about here there is nothing to shoot, and I have\r\nfound it very dull.'\r\n\r\n`Still you have been doing your duty, my dear boy; you were entrusted\r\nwith the care of the family, and a youth of manly character will not\r\ndepend for happiness on mere excitement.'\r\n\r\nAs the shades of night approached, we made haste to conclude the day's\r\nwork, by preparing the kangaroo, part for immediate use, and part for\r\nsalting. The animals were fed, and a plentiful allowance of salt made\r\nto them. Our own supper of broiled salmon and potatoes was dispatched\r\nwith great appetite, and we retired, with thankful hearts, to sound and\r\nwell-earned repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nNext morning, while the breakfast was getting ready, I attended to the\r\nbeautiful skin of the kangaroo, which I was anxious to preserve entire;\r\nand afterwards, when Fritz had prepared everything in readiness for our\r\ntrip to the wreck, I called Ernest and Jack in order to give them some\r\nparting injunctions.\r\n\r\nThey, however, had disappeared directly after breakfast, and their\r\nmother could only guess that, as we required potatoes, they might have\r\ngone to fetch a supply. I desired her to reprove them, on their return,\r\nfor starting away without leave; but, as it appeared they had taken\r\nTurk, I satisfied myself that no harm was likely to befall them,\r\nalthough it was not without reluctance that I left my dear wife alone\r\nwith little Franz, cheering her with hopes of our speedy return with\r\nnew treasures from the wreck.\r\n\r\nAdvancing steadily on our way, we crossed the bridge at Jackal River,\r\nwhen suddenly, to our no small astonishment, Jack and Ernest burst out\r\nof a hiding-place where they had lain in wait for us, and were\r\nenchanted with the startling effect of their unexpected appearance upon\r\ntheir unsuspecting father and brother.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that they fully believed they might now go with us to\r\nthe wreck.\r\n\r\nTo this notion I at once put a decided stop, although I could not find\r\nit in my heart to scold the two merry rogues for their thoughtless\r\nfrolic, more especially as I particularly wished to send back a message\r\nto my wife. I told them they must hurry home, so as not to leave their\r\nmother in suspense, although, as they were already so far, they might\r\ncollect some salt.\r\n\r\nAnd I instructed them to explain that, as my work on board would take\r\nup a long time, she must try to bear with our absence for a night. This\r\nI had meant to say when we parted, but my courage had failed, knowing\r\nhow much she would object to such a plan, and I had resolved to return\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\nOn consideration, however, of the importance of constructing a raft,\r\nwhich was my intention in going, and finishing it without a second\r\ntrip, I determined to remain on board for the night, as the boys had,\r\nunintentionally, given me the chance of sending a message to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n`Goodbye boys, take care of yourselves! We're off,' shouted Fritz, as I\r\njoined him in the tub-boat, and we shoved off.\r\n\r\nThe current carried us briskly out of the bay; we were very soon\r\nmoored safely alongside the wreck, and scrambling up her shattered\r\nsides, stood on what remained of the deck, and began at once to lay our\r\nplans. I wanted to make a raft fit to carry on shore a great variety of\r\narticles far too large and heavy for our present boat.\r\n\r\nA number of empty water-casks seemed just what was required for a\r\nfoundation: we closed them tightly, pushed them overboard, and\r\narranging twelve of them side by side in rows of three, we firmly\r\nsecured them together by means of spars, and then proceeded to lay a\r\ngood substantial floor of planks, which was defended by a low bulwark.\r\nIn this way we soon had a first-rate raft, exactly suited to our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible to return to land that same evening, for\r\nwe were thoroughly fatigued by our labours, and had eaten only the\r\nlight refreshment we had brought in our wallets, scarcely desisting a\r\nmoment from our work.\r\n\r\nRejoicing that we were not expected home, we now made an excellent\r\nsupper from the ship's provisions, and then rested for the night on\r\nspring mattresses, a perfect luxury to us, after our hard and narrow\r\nhammocks.\r\n\r\nNext morning we actively set about loading the raft and boat: first\r\ncarrying off the entire contents of our own cabins; and, passing on to\r\nthe captain's room, we removed the furniture, as well as the doors and\r\nwindow-frames, with their bolts, bars and locks. We next took the\r\nofficers' chests, and those belonging to the carpenter and gunsmith;\r\nthe contents of these latter we had to remove in portions, as their\r\nweight was far beyond our strength.\r\n\r\nOne large chest was filled with an assortment of fancy goods, and\r\nreminded us of a jeweller's shop, so glittering was the display of gold\r\nand silver watches, snuff-boxes, buckles, studs, chains, rings and all\r\nmanner of trinkets; these, and a box of money, drew our attention for a\r\ntime; but more useful to us at present was a case of common knives and\r\nforks, which I was glad to find, as more suited to us than the smart\r\nsilver ones we had previously taken on shore.\r\n\r\nTo my delight we found, most carefully packed, a number of young fruit\r\ntrees; and we read on the tickets attached to them the names, so\r\npleasant to European ears, of the apple, pear, chestnut, orange,\r\nalmond, peach, apricot, plum, cherry and vine.\r\n\r\nThe cargo, which had been destined for the supply of a distant colony,\r\nproved, in fact, a rich and almost inexhaustible treasure to us.\r\nIronmongery, plumber's tools, lead, paint, grind-stones, cart wheels,\r\nand all that was necessary for the work of a smith's forge, spades and\r\nplough-shares, sacks of maize, peas, oats, and wheat, a hand-mill, and\r\nalso the parts of a saw-mill so carefully numbered that, were we strong\r\nenough, it would be easy to put it up, had been stowed away.\r\n\r\nSo bewildered were we by the wealth around us that for some time we\r\nwere at a loss as to what to remove to the raft. It would be\r\nimpossible to take everything; yet the first storm would complete the\r\ndestruction of the ship, and we should lose all we left behind.\r\n\r\nSelecting a number of the most useful articles, however, including of\r\ncourse the grain and the fruit trees, we gradually loaded our raft.\r\n\r\nFishing lines, reels, cordage, and a couple of harpoons were put on\r\nboard, as well as a mariner's compass. Fritz, recollecting our\r\nencounter with the shark, placed the harpoons in readiness; and amused\r\nme by seeming to picture himself a whaler, flourishing his harpoon in\r\nmost approved fashion. Early in the afternoon, both our craft were\r\nheavily laden, and we were ready to make for the shore. The voyage was\r\nbegun with considerable anxiety, as, with the raft in tow, there was\r\nsome danger of an accident.\r\n\r\nBut the sea being calm and the wind favourable, we found we could\r\nspread the sail, and our progress was very satisfactory. Presently,\r\nFritz asked me for the telescope, as he had observed something curious\r\nfloating at a distance. Then handing it back, he begged me to examine\r\nthe object; which I soon discovered to be a turtle asleep on the water,\r\nand of course unconscious of our approach.\r\n\r\n`Do, father, steer towards it!' exclaimed he. I accordingly did so,\r\nthat he might have a nearer look at the creature. Little did I suspect\r\nwhat was to follow. The lad's back was turned to me, and the broad sail\r\nwas between us, so that I could not perceive his actions; when, all of\r\na sudden, I experienced a shock, and the thrill as of line running\r\nthrough a reel. Before I had time to call out, a second shock, and the\r\nsensation of the boat being rapidly drawn through the water, alarmed\r\nme.\r\n\r\n`Fritz, what are you about?' cried I. `You are sending us to the\r\nbottom.'\r\n\r\n`I have him, hurrah! I have him safe!' shouted he, in eager\r\nexcitement. To my amazement, I perceived that he really had struck the\r\ntortoise with a harpoon; a rope was attached to it, and the creature\r\nwas running away with us.\r\n\r\nLowering the sail and seizing my hatchet, I hastened forward, in order\r\nto cut the line, and cast adrift at once turtle and harpoon.\r\n\r\n`Father! Do wait!' pleaded the boy. `There is no danger just yet! I\r\npromise to cut the line myself the instant it is necessary! Let us\r\ncatch this turtle if we possibly can.'\r\n\r\n`My dear boy, the turtle will be a very dear bargain, if he upsets all\r\nour goods into the sea, even if he does not drown us too. For heaven's\r\nsake, be careful! I will wait a few minutes, but the instant there is\r\ndanger, cut the line.'\r\n\r\nAs the turtle began to make for the open sea, I hoisted the sail\r\nagain; and, finding the opposition too much for it, the creature again\r\ndirected its course landward, drawing us rapidly after it. The part of\r\nthe shore for which the turtle was making was considerably to the left\r\nof our usual landing-place. The beach there shelved very gradually, and\r\nat some distance from land we grounded with a sharp shock, but\r\nfortunately without a capsize.\r\n\r\nThe turtle was evidently greatly exhausted, and no wonder, since it had\r\nbeen acting the part of a steam tug, and had been dragging, at full\r\nspeed, a couple of heavily laden vessels. Its intention was to escape\r\nto land; but I leaped into the water, and wading up to it, dispatched\r\nit with my axe. Such was its tenacity of life, however, that it did not\r\ncease its struggles, until I had actually severed its head from its\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAs we were by no means far from Falconhurst, Fritz gave notice of our\r\napproach by firing off his gun, as well as shouting loudly in his glee;\r\nand, while we were yet engaged in securing our boats and getting the\r\nturtle on shore, the whole family appeared in the distance hastening\r\neagerly towards us; and our new prize, together with the well-laden\r\nboat and raft, excited the liveliest interest; my wife's chief\r\npleasure, however, consisted in seeing us safely back, as our night's\r\nabsence had disturbed her, and she was horrified by the description of\r\nour dangerous run in the wake of the fugitive turtle.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to remove some of our goods before night, the boys ran\r\noff to fetch the sledge; while I, having no anchor, contrived to moor\r\nthe boats by means of some of the heavy blocks of iron we had brought.\r\nIt required our united strength to get the turtle hoisted on to the\r\nsledge, its weight being prodigious; we found it, indeed, with the\r\naddition of the sapling fruit-trees, quite a sufficient load.\r\n\r\nWe then made the best of our way home, chatting merrily about our\r\nvarious adventures. The first thing to be done on arriving was to\r\nobtain some of the turtle's flesh to cook for supper. To my wife this\r\nappeared necessarily a work of time, as well as of difficulty; but I\r\nturned the beast on its back, and soon detached a portion of the meat\r\nfrom the breast with a hatchet, by breaking the lower shell; and I then\r\ndirected that it should be cooked, with a little salt, shell and all.\r\n\r\n`But let me first cut away this disgusting green fat,' said my wife,\r\nwith a little shudder. `See how it sticks all over the meat. No one\r\ncould eat anything so nasty.'\r\n\r\n`Leave the fat, whatever you do!' exclaimed I. `Why, my dear, that is\r\nthe very best part, and the delight of the epicures. If there be really\r\ntoo much, cut some off-it can be used as lard, and let the dogs make a\r\nsupper of the refuse.'\r\n\r\n`And the handsome shell!' cried Fritz. `I should like to make a\r\nwater-trough of that, to stand near the brook, and be kept always full\r\nof clear water. How useful it would be!'\r\n\r\n`That is a capital idea,' I replied, `and we may manage it easily, if\r\nwe can find clay so as to make a firm foundation on which to place it.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, as to clay,' said Jack, `I have a grand lump of clay there under\r\nthat root.'\r\n\r\n`Well done, my lad! When did you find it?'\r\n\r\n`He found a bed of clay near the river this morning,' said his mother,\r\n`and came home in such a mess, I had regularly to scrape his clothes\r\nand wash him thoroughly!'\r\n\r\n`Well, mother, I can only tell you I should never in all my days have\r\nfound the clay, if I had not slipped and fallen amongst it.'\r\n\r\n`That I can well believe,' returned his mother, `only, to hear your\r\ntalk this morning, one would have thought your discovery of clay the\r\nresult of very arduous search indeed.'\r\n\r\n`When you have ended the question of the clay and the turtle-shell,'\r\nsaid Ernest, `I should like to show you some roots I found today; they\r\nare getting rather dry now. They look something like radishes, although\r\nthe plant itself was almost a bush; but I have not ventured to taste\r\nthem, although our old sow was devouring them at a great rate.'\r\n\r\n`In that you did wisely, my boy. Swine eat many things injurious to\r\nmen. Let me see your roots. How did you discover them?'\r\n\r\n`I was rambling in the wood this morning, and came upon the sow, very\r\nbusy grubbing under a small bush, and eating something ravenously; so I\r\ndrove her away, and found a number of these roots, which I brought for\r\nyou to see.'\r\n\r\n`Indeed, Ernest,' I exclaimed, after taking the roots in my hand and\r\nconsidering them attentively, `I am inclined to believe that you have\r\nreally made a brilliant discovery! If this proves to be, as I expect,\r\nthe manioc root, we might lose every other eatable we possess, and yet\r\nnot starve. In the West Indies, cakes called cassava bread are made\r\nfrom it; and, already having potatoes, we shall be very independent if\r\nwe can succeed in preparing flour from these roots. Great care must be\r\ntaken in the manufacture to express the juice, otherwise the flour may\r\nbe injurious and even poisonous.\r\n\r\n`If we can collect a sufficient quantity, we will attempt bread-making.\r\nI think I know how to set about it.'\r\n\r\nFinding there was still time to make another trip with the sledge, I\r\nwent off with the elder boys, leaving Franz with his mother; and we all\r\nlooked forward with satisfaction to the prospect of the princely supper\r\nthey were to have ready for us, for our day's work had been none of the\r\nlightest.\r\n\r\n`I have been thinking about my turtle, father,' said Fritz, as we went\r\nalong, `is not the shell very valuable? Surely beautiful combs, boxes,\r\nand a number of ornamental things are made of tortoise-shell, and if\r\nso, it seems a pity to use it for a water-trough.'\r\n\r\n`Your turtle, Fritz, is only fit for eating, its shell is worthless as\r\nregards ornament; whereas the species whose shell is prized so much is\r\nunfit for food. Tortoiseshell is subjected to the action of heat, the\r\nouter layer peels off, leaving a beautifully marked, semi-transparent\r\nsurface, which is susceptible of a very high polish.'\r\n\r\nThe sledge quickly received its second load from the raft. Chests, four\r\ncart-wheels and the hand-mill were placed on it, with all manner of\r\nsmaller articles, and we lost no time in returning to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nMy wife welcomed us joyfully, for she said we had been regularly\r\noverworked during the last two days. `However, now you are come home to\r\nrest,' said she, `and you little think what refreshment awaits you here\r\nin the shade. Come and see my cellar!' and she smilingly exhibited a\r\nsmall cask, half sunk in the ground, and well sheltered with leaves and\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n`Ah! You wonder where this came from,' continued my wife; `well, I\r\nfound it myself on the sands, today, while you were all absent; and\r\nfancying it was wine of some sort, I got it up here on purpose to be\r\nready for you. The boys are most anxious to know what sort of wine it\r\nwill prove to be.'\r\n\r\nAs the simplest method of ascertaining this, I inserted a straw at the\r\nvent-hole, and presently announced that in all my life I had never\r\nenjoyed a more delicious draught of canary sack. My wife was immensely\r\npleased to find that her exertions in my behalf had not been thrown\r\naway, and the boys pressed round me, armed with straws, and begging for\r\na taste.\r\n\r\nAfter so strongly expressing my own enjoyment of the wine, it seemed\r\nunreasonable to deny them this, and I let them come in turns, but was\r\nspeedily obliged to call a halt; for the rogues got so eager and\r\nexcited that I had to reprove them for their greediness, and warn them\r\nof the risk they ran of being intoxicated.\r\n\r\nSupper was more to the purpose; and, as the turtle proved delicious, it\r\nwas heartily enjoyed, and gave us strength to haul the mattresses we\r\nhad brought from the ship, up into our sleeping-rooms, so that very\r\nrefreshing slumbers closed the day.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, I got up without rousing any of the others,\r\nintending to pay a visit to the beach; for I had my doubts about the\r\nsafety of my vessels on the open shore. The dogs were delighted when I\r\ndescended the ladder, and bounded to meet me; the cocks crowed and\r\nflapped their wings; two pretty kids gambolled around; all was life and\r\nenergy: the ass alone seemed disinclined to begin the day, and, as I\r\nespecially required his services, this was unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI put his morning dreams to flight, however, and harnessed him to the\r\nsledge; the cow, as she had not been milked, enjoyed the privilege of\r\nfurther repose, and with the rest of the family, I left her dozing.\r\n\r\nMy fears as to the safety of the boats were soon dispelled, for they\r\nwere all right; and, being in haste to return, the load I collected\r\nfrom their freight was but a light one, and the donkey willingly\r\ntrotted home with it, he, as well as I, being uncommonly ready for\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nApproaching the tree, not a sound was to be heard, not a soul was to be\r\nseen, although it was broad day; and great was my good wife's surprise,\r\nwhen, roused by the clatter and hullabaloo I made, she started up, and\r\nbecame aware of the late hour!\r\n\r\n`What can have made us oversleep ourselves like this?' she exclaimed.\r\n`It must be the fault of those mattresses, they are delightful, but\r\nreally too lulling; see the children are sound asleep still.'\r\n\r\nWith much stretching and many yawns, the boys at last came tumbling\r\ndown from the tree, rubbing their eyes and seeming but half awake;\r\nErnest last, as usual.\r\n\r\n`Come, my boys,' said I, `this will never do! Your beds were too\r\nluxurious last night, I see.'\r\n\r\nIn my own opinion, however, I felt there was something else to blame\r\nbesides the comfortable mattresses, and I made a mental resolve that\r\nthe captain's fine canary should be dealt with very sparingly in\r\nfuture. `So now for prayers and breakfast,' I continued, `and then off\r\nto work; I must have our cargo landed in time to get the boats off with\r\nthe next tide.'\r\n\r\nBy dint of downright hard work, we accomplished this, and I got on\r\nboard with Fritz as soon as they were afloat; the rest turned\r\nhomewards, but Jack lingered behind with such imploring looks, that I\r\ncould not resist taking him with me.\r\n\r\nMy intention had been simply to take the vessels round to the harbour\r\nin Safety Bay, but the calm sea and fine weather tempted me to make\r\nanother trip to the wreck. It took up more time than I expected, so\r\nthat, when on board, we could only make a further examination of the\r\ncargo, collect a few portable articles and then avail ourselves of the\r\nsea-breeze which would fail us later in the evening.\r\n\r\nTo Jack the pleasure of hunting about in the hold, was novel and\r\ncharming, and very soon a tremendous rattling and clattering heralded\r\nhis approach with a wheelbarrow, in the highest spirits at his good\r\nfortune in having found such a capital thing in which to bring home\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Fritz, whose news was still more important. He had\r\nfound, carefully packed and enclosed within partitions, what appeared\r\nto be the separate parts of a pinnace, with rigging and fittings\r\ncomplete, even to a couple of small brass guns. This was a great\r\ndiscovery, and I hastened to see if the lad was right. Indeed he was,\r\nbut my pleasure was qualified by a sense of the arduous task it would\r\nbe to put such a craft together so as to be fit for sea.\r\n\r\nFor the present, we had barely time to get something to eat and hurry\r\ninto the boat, where were collected our new acquisitions, namely, a\r\ncopper boiler, iron plates, tobacco-graters, two grindstones, a small\r\nbarrel of powder, and another of flints, two wheelbarrows besides\r\nJack's, which he kept under his own especial care.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the shore, we were surprised to see a number of little\r\nfigures ranged in a row along the water's edge, and apparently gazing\r\nfixedly at us. They seemed to wear dark coats and white waistcoats, and\r\nstood quite still with their arms dropping by their sides, only every\r\nnow and then one would extend them gently, as though longing to embrace\r\nus.\r\n\r\n`Ah! Here at last come the pigmy inhabitants of the country to welcome\r\nus!' cried I, laughing.\r\n\r\n`Oh, father!' exclaimed Jack, `I hope they are Lilliputians! I once\r\nread in a book about them, so there must be such people you know, only\r\nthese look rather too large.'\r\n\r\n`You must be content to give up the Lilliputians and accept penguins,\r\nmy dear Jack,' said I. `We have not before seen them in such numbers,\r\nbut Ernest knocked one down, if you remember, soon after we landed.\r\nThey are excellent swimmers, but helpless on land, as they can neither\r\nfly nor run.'\r\n\r\nWe were gradually approaching the land as I spoke, and no sooner was\r\nthe water shallow, than out sprang Jack from his tub, and wading\r\nashore, took the unsuspecting birds by surprise, and with his stick\r\nlaid half a dozen, right and left, either stunned or dead at his feet.\r\nThe rest escaped into the water, dived, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs these penguins are disagreeable food, on account of their strong\r\noily taste, I was sorry Jack had attacked them; but going to examine\r\nthem when we landed, some of the fallen arose from their swoon, and\r\nbegan solemnly to waddle away, upon which we caught them, and tying\r\ntheir feet together with long grass, laid them on the sand to wait\r\nuntil we were ready to start.\r\n\r\nThe three wheelbarrows then each received a load, the live penguins\r\nseated gravely were trundled along by Jack, and away we went at a great\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe unusual noise of our approach set the dogs barking furiously, but\r\ndiscovering us, they rushed forward with such forcible demonstrations\r\nof delight, that poor little Jack, who, as it was, could scarcely\r\nmanage his barrow, was fairly upset, penguins and all. This was too\r\nmuch for his patience, and it was absurd to see how he started up and\r\ncuffed them soundly for their boisterous behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis scene, and the examination of our burdens, caused great\r\nmerriment: the tobacco-grater and iron plates evidently puzzling\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nI sent the boys to catch some of our geese and ducks, and bid them\r\nfasten a penguin to each by the leg, thinking that it was worth while\r\nto try to tame them.\r\n\r\nMy wife had exerted herself in our absence to provide a good store of\r\npotatoes, and also of manioc root. I admired her industry, and little\r\nFranz said, `Ah, father! I wonder what you will say when mother and I\r\ngive you some Indian corn, and melons, and pumpkins and cucumbers!'\r\n\r\n`Now, you little chatterbox!' cried she. `You have let out my secret! I\r\nwas to have the pleasure of surprising your father when my plants were\r\ngrowing up.'\r\n\r\n`Ah, the poor disappointed little mother!' said I. `Never mind! I am\r\ncharmed to hear about it. Only do tell me, where did those seeds come\r\nfrom?'\r\n\r\n`Out of my magic bag, of course!' replied she. `And each time I have\r\ngone for potatoes, I have sown seeds in the ground which was dug up to\r\nget them; and I have planted potatoes also.'\r\n\r\n`Well done, you wise little woman!' I exclaimed, `Why, you are a model\r\nof prudence and industry!'\r\n\r\n`But,' continued she, `I do not half like the appearance of those\r\ntobacco-graters you have brought. Is it possible you are going to make\r\nsnuff? Do, pray, let us make sure of abundance of food for our mouths,\r\nbefore we think of our noses!'\r\n\r\n`Make your mind easy, my wife. I have not the remotest intention of\r\nintroducing the dirty, ridiculous habit of snuffing into your family!\r\nPlease to treat my graters with respect, however, because they are to\r\nbe the means of providing you with the first fresh bread you have seen\r\nthis many a long day.'\r\n\r\n`What possible connection can there be between bread and\r\ntobacco-graters? I cannot imagine what you mean, and to talk of bread\r\nwhere there are no ovens is only tantalizing.'\r\n\r\n`Ah, you must not expect real loaves,' said I. `But on these flat iron\r\nplates I can bake flat cakes or scones, which will be excellent bread;\r\nI mean to try at once what I can do with Ernest's roots. And first of\r\nall, I want you to make me a nice strong canvas bag.'\r\n\r\nThis my wife willingly undertook to do, but she evidently had not much\r\nfaith in my powers as a baker, and I saw her set on a good potful of\r\npotatoes before beginning to work, as though to make sure of a meal\r\nwithout depending on my bread.\r\n\r\nSpreading a large sailcloth on the ground, I summoned my boys and set\r\nto work. Each took a grater and a supply of well-washed manioc root,\r\nand when all were seated round the cloth--`Once, twice, thrice! Off!'\r\ncried I, beginning to rub a root as hard as I could against the rough\r\nsurface of my grater. My example was instantly followed by the whole\r\nparty, amid bursts of merriment, as each remarked the funny attitude\r\nand odd gestures of his neighbours while vehemently rubbing, rasping,\r\ngrating and grinding down the roots allotted to him. No one was tempted\r\nby the look of the flour to stop and taste it, for in truth it looked\r\nmuch like wet sawdust.\r\n\r\n`Cassava bread is highly esteemed in many parts of the New World, and I\r\nhave even heard that some Europeans there prefer it to the wheaten\r\nbread of their own country. There are various species of manioc. One\r\nsort grows quickly, and its roots ripen in a very short time. Another\r\nkind is of somewhat slower growth. The roots of the third kind do not\r\ncome to maturity for two years. The two first are poisonous, if eaten\r\nraw, yet they are preferred to the last, which is harmless, because\r\nthey are so much more fruitful, and the flour produced is excellent, if\r\nthe scrapings are carefully pressed.'\r\n\r\n`What is the good of pressing them, father?' inquired Ernest.\r\n\r\n`It is in order to express the sap, which contains the poison. The dry\r\npith is wholesome and nourishing. Still, I do not mean to taste my\r\ncakes, until I have tried their effect on our fowls and the ape.'\r\n\r\nBy this time our supply of roots being reduced to damp powder, the\r\ncanvas bag was filled with it, and tying it tightly up, I attempted to\r\nsqueeze it, but soon found that mechanical aid was necessary in order\r\nto express the moisture.\r\n\r\nMy arrangements for this purpose were as follows. A strong straight\r\nbeam was made flat on one side, smooth planks were laid across two of\r\nthe lower roots of our tree; on these we placed the sack, above the\r\nsack another plank, and over that the long beam; one end was passed\r\nunder a root near the sack, the other projected far forward. And to\r\nthat we attached all the heaviest weights we could think of, such as an\r\nanvil, iron bars and masses of lead. The consequent pressure on the bag\r\nwas enormous, and the sap flowed from it to the ground.\r\n\r\n`Will this stuff keep any time?' inquired my wife, who came to see how\r\nwe were getting on. `Or must all this great bagful be used at once? In\r\nthat case we shall have to spend the whole of tomorrow in baking\r\ncakes.'\r\n\r\n`Not at all,' I replied, `once dry, the flour in barrels will keep\r\nfresh a long time. We shall use a great deal of this, however, as you\r\nshall see.'\r\n\r\n`Do you think we might begin now, father?' said Fritz.\r\n\r\n`There does not seem the least moisture remaining.'\r\n\r\n`Certainly,' said I. `But I shall only make one cake today for an\r\nexperiment; we must see how it agrees with Master Knips and the hens\r\nbefore we set up a bakehouse in regular style.'\r\n\r\nI took out a couple of handfuls of flour for this purpose, and with a\r\nstick loosened and stirred the remainder, which I intended should again\r\nbe pressed. While an iron plate placed over a good fire was getting\r\nhot, I mixed the meal with water and a little salt, kneaded it well,\r\nand forming a thick cake, laid it on the hot plate when, one side\r\npresently becoming a nice yellow brown colour, it was turned and was\r\nquickly baked.\r\n\r\nIt smelt so delicious, that the boys quite envied the two hens and the\r\nmonkey, who were selected as the subjects of this interesting\r\nexperiment, and they silently watched them gobbling up the bits of cake\r\nI gave them, until Fritz turned to me, saying, `Suppose the cake is\r\npoisonous, what effect will it have on the creatures? Will they be\r\nstupefied, or will they suffer pain?'\r\n\r\n`That depends upon the nature of the poison. Some cause violent pain,\r\nas colchicum, hellebore, and aconite. Others produce stupefaction and\r\nparalysis, as opium, hemlock, and prussic acid; while others again, as\r\nstrychnine, are followed by violent convulsions, or, as belladonna, by\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\n`The effects of course vary according to the quantity taken, and such\r\nremedies should be applied as will best counteract the effect of each\r\npoison: emetics in any case, to remove as much as possible of the\r\nnoxious substance, combined with oils and mucilaginous drinks to soothe\r\nand protect the stomach in the case of irritants; stimulants, such as\r\nspirits, ammonia, or strong coffee to rouse from the stupor of the\r\nnarcotics; and sedative drugs, which are perhaps in themselves poisons,\r\nto counteract the over stimulation of the nerves caused by the\r\nconvulsant poisons.\r\n\r\n`But now let us think no more of poisons; here is supper ready and we\r\nneed not be afraid to eat roast penguin and potatoes.'\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done; we left the fowls picking up the least crumb\r\nthey could find of the questionable food, and assembled to enjoy our\r\nevening meal of roast penguin. The potatoes were as usual excellent,\r\nthe penguin really not so bad as I expected, although fishy in taste\r\nand very tough.\r\n\r\nNext morning every one expressed the tenderest concern as to the\r\nhealth of Knips and the hens; and lively pleasure was in every\r\ncountenance when Jack, who ran first to make the visit of inquiry,\r\nbrought news of their perfect good health and spirits.\r\n\r\nNo time was now to be lost, and bread-baking commenced in earnest. A\r\nlarge fire was kindled, the plates heated, the meal made into cakes,\r\neach of the boys busily preparing his own, and watching the baking most\r\neagerly. Mistakes occurred, of course, some of the bread was burnt,\r\nsome not done enough; but a pile of nice tempting cakes was at length\r\nready, and with plenty of good milk we breakfasted right royally, and\r\nin high spirits at our success.\r\n\r\nSoon after, whilst feeding the poultry with the fragments of the\r\nrepast, I observed that the captive penguins were quite at ease among\r\nthem and as tame as the geese and ducks; their bonds were therefore\r\nloosed, and they were left as free as the other fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nHaving now discovered how to provide bread for my family, my thoughts\r\nbegan to revert to the wreck and all the valuables yet contained within\r\nit. Above all, I was bent on acquiring possession of the beautiful\r\npinnace, and aware that our united efforts would be required to do the\r\nnecessary work, I began to coax and persuade my wife to let me go in\r\nforce with all the boys except Franz.\r\n\r\nShe very unwillingly gave her consent at last, but not until I had\r\nfaithfully promised never to pass a night on board. I did so with\r\nreluctance, and we parted, neither feeling quite satisfied with the\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted to go in so large a party, and merrily carried\r\nprovision-bags filled with cassava-bread and potatoes.\r\n\r\nReaching Safety Bay without adventure, we first paid a visit to the\r\ngeese and ducks which inhabited the marsh there, and having fed them\r\nand seen they were thriving well, we buckled on each his cork-belt,\r\nstepped into the tub-boat, and, with the raft in tow, steered straight\r\nfor the wreck.\r\n\r\nWhen we got on board, I desired the boys to collect whatever came\r\nfirst to hand, and load the raft to be ready for our return at night,\r\nand then we made a minute inspection of the pinnace.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that difficulties, well-nigh insuperable, lay\r\nbetween me and the safe possession of the beautiful little vessel. She\r\nlay in a most un-get-at-able position at the further end of the hold,\r\nstowed in so confined and narrow a space, that it was impossible to\r\nthink of fitting the parts together there. At the same time these parts\r\nwere so heavy, that removing them to a convenient place piece by piece\r\nwas equally out of the question.\r\n\r\nI sent the boys away to amuse themselves by rummaging out anything they\r\nliked to carry away, and sat down quietly to consider the matter.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes became used to the dim light which entered the compartment\r\nthrough a chink or crevice here and there, I perceived how carefully\r\nevery part of the pinnace was arranged and marked with numbers, so that\r\nif only I could bestow sufficient time on the work, and contrive space\r\nin which to execute it, I might reasonably hope for success.\r\n\r\n`Room! Room to work in, boys! That's what we need in the first place!'\r\nI cried, as my sons came to see what plan I had devised, for so great\r\nwas their reliance on me, that they never doubted the pinnace was to be\r\nours.\r\n\r\n`Fetch axes, and let us break down the compartment and clear space all\r\nround.'\r\n\r\nTo work we all went, yet evening drew near, and but little impression\r\nwas made on the mass of woodwork around us. We had to acknowledge that\r\nan immense amount of labour and perseverance would be required before\r\nwe could call ourselves the owners of the useful and elegant little\r\ncraft, which lay within this vast hulk like a fossil shell embedded in\r\na rock.\r\n\r\nPreparations for returning to shore were hastily made, and we landed\r\nwithout much relish for the long walk to Falconhurst, when, to our\r\ngreat surprise and pleasure, we found my wife and little Franz at\r\nTentholm awaiting us. She had resolved to take up her quarters there\r\nduring the time we should be engaged on the wreck. `In that way you\r\nwill live nearer your work, and I shall not quite lose sight of you!'\r\nsaid she, with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n`You are a good, sensible, kind wife,' I exclaimed, delighted with her\r\nplan, `and we shall work with the greater diligence, that you may\r\nreturn as soon as possible to your dear Falconhurst.'\r\n\r\n`Come and see what we have brought you, mother!' cried Fritz. `A good\r\naddition to your stores, is it not?' and he and his brothers exhibited\r\ntwo small casks of butter, three of flour, corn, rice, and many other\r\narticles welcome to our careful housewife.\r\n\r\nOur days were now spent in hard work on board, first cutting and\r\nclearing an open space round the pinnace, and then putting the parts\r\ntogether. We started early and returned at night, bringing each time a\r\nvaluable freight from the old vessel. At length, with incredible\r\nlabour, all was completed. The pinnace stood actually ready to be\r\nlaunched, but imprisoned within massive wooden walls which defied our\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIt seemed exactly as though the graceful vessel had awakened from\r\nsleep, and was longing to spring into the free blue sea, and spread her\r\nwings to the breeze. I could not bear to think that our success so far\r\nshould be followed by failure and disappointment. Yet no possible means\r\nof setting her free could I conceive, and I was almost in despair, when\r\nan idea occurred to me which, if I could carry it out, would effect her\r\nrelease without further labour or delay.\r\n\r\nWithout explaining my purpose, I got a large cast-iron mortar, filled\r\nit with gunpowder, secured a block of oak to the top, through which I\r\npierced a hole for the insertion of the match, and this great petard I\r\nso placed, that when it exploded, it should blow out the side of the\r\nvessel next which the pinnace lay.\r\n\r\nThen securing it with chains, that the recoil might do no damage, I\r\ntold the boys I was going ashore earlier than usual, and calmly\r\ndesired them to get into the boat. Then lighting a match I had\r\nprepared, and which would burn some time before reaching the powder, I\r\nhastened after them with a pounding heart, and we made for the land.\r\n\r\nWe brought the raft close in shore and began to unload it; the other\r\nboat I did not haul up, but kept her ready to put off at a moment's\r\nnotice; my anxiety was unobserved by anyone, as I listened with\r\nstrained nerves for the expected sound. It came!--a flash! a mighty\r\nroar--a grand burst of smoke!\r\n\r\nMy wife and children, terror-stricken, turned their eyes towards the\r\nsea, whence the startling noise came, and then in fear and wonder,\r\nlooked to me for some explanation. `Perhaps,' said my wife, as I did\r\nnot speak, `perhaps you have left a light burning near some of the\r\ngunpowder, and an explosion has taken place.'\r\n\r\n`Not at all unlikely,' replied I quietly, `we had a fire below when we\r\nwere caulking the seams of the pinnace. I shall go off at once and see\r\nwhat has happened. Will anyone come?'\r\n\r\nThe boys needed no second invitation, but sprang into the boat, while I\r\nlingered to reassure my wife by whispering a few words of explanation,\r\nand then joining them, we pulled for the wreck at a more rapid rate\r\nthan we ever had done before.\r\n\r\nNo alteration had taken place in the side at which we usually boarded\r\nher, and we pulled round to the further side, where a marvellous sight\r\nawaited us. A huge rent appeared, the decks and bulwarks were torn\r\nopen, the water was covered with floating wreckage--all seemed in\r\nruins; and the compartment where the pinnace rested was fully revealed\r\nto view.\r\n\r\nThere sat the little beauty, to all appearance uninjured; and the\r\nboys, whose attention was taken up with the melancholy scene of ruin\r\nand confusion around them, were astonished to hear me shout, in\r\nenthusiastic delight, `Hurrah! She is ours! The lovely pinnace is won!\r\nWe shall be able to launch her easily after all. Come, boys, let us see\r\nif she has suffered from the explosion, which has set her free.'\r\n\r\nThe boys gazed at me for a moment, and then guessing my secret, `You\r\nplanned it yourself, you clever, cunning father! Oh, that machine we\r\nhelped to make, was on purpose to blow it up!' cried they; and eagerly\r\nthey followed me into the shattered opening, where, to my intense\r\nsatisfaction, I found everything as I could wish and the captive in\r\nno way a sufferer from the violent measures I had adopted for her\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nThe boys were deeply interested in examining the effects of the\r\nexplosion, and in the explanation I gave them, of the principle, and\r\nproper way to manage a petard.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the launch could now be effected without much\r\ntrouble; I had been careful to place rollers beneath the keel, so that\r\nby means of levers and pulleys we might, with our united strength, move\r\nher forward towards the water.\r\n\r\nA rope was attached by which to regulate the speed of the descent, and\r\nthen, all hands putting their shoulders to the work, the pinnace began\r\nto slide from the stocks, and finally slipped gently and steadily into\r\nthe water, where she floated as if conscious it was her native element;\r\nwhile we, wild with excitement, cheered and waved enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nWe then only remained long enough to secure our prize carefully at the\r\nmost sheltered point, and went back to Tentholm, where we accounted for\r\nthe explosion; saying that having blown away one side of the ship, we\r\nshould be able to obtain the rest of its contents with a very few more\r\ndays' work.\r\n\r\nThese days were devoted to completing the rigging, the mounting of her\r\ntwo little brass guns, and all necessary arrangements about the\r\npinnace. It was wonderful what martial ardour was awakened by the\r\npossession of a vessel armed with two real guns. The boys chattered\r\nincessantly about savages, fleets of canoes, attack, defence and final\r\nannihilation of the invaders.\r\n\r\nI assured them that, brilliant as their victories would doubtless be,\r\nwe should have good cause to thank God if their fighting powers and\r\nnew-born valour were never put to the test.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was fully equipped and ready to sail, while yet no idea of\r\nthe surprise we were preparing for her had dawned upon my wife, and I\r\npermitted the boys, who had kept the secret so well, to fire a salute\r\nwhen we entered the bay.\r\n\r\nCasting off from the ship, and spreading the sail, our voyage began.\r\nThe pinnace glided swiftly through the water, I stood at the helm,\r\nErnest and Jack manned the guns, and Fritz gave the word of command,\r\n`Fire!' Bang! bang! rattled out a thrilling report, which echoed and\r\nre-echoed among the cliffs, followed by our shouts and hurrahs.\r\n\r\nMy wife and her little boy rushed hastily forward from near the tent,\r\nand we could plainly see their alarm and astonishment; but speedily\r\nrecognizing us, they waved joyfully, and came quickly to the\r\nlanding-place to meet us.\r\n\r\nBy skilful management we brought the pinnace near a projection of the\r\nbank, and Fritz assisted his mother to come on board, where,\r\nbreathless with haste and excitement, she exclaimed, `You dear,\r\nhorrid, wonderful people, shall I scold you or praise you? You have\r\nfrightened me out of my wits! To see a beautiful little ship come\r\nsailing in was startling enough, for I could not conceive who might be\r\non board, but the report of your guns made me tremble with fear--and\r\nhad I not recognized your voices directly after, I should have run away\r\nwith Franz Heaven knows where!\r\n\r\n`But have you really done all this work yourselves?' she continued,\r\nwhen we had been forgiven for terrifying her with our vainglorious\r\nsalute. `What a charming little yacht! I should not be afraid to sail\r\nin this myself.'\r\n\r\nAfter the pinnace had been shown off, and received the admiration she\r\ndeserved, while our industry, skill, and perseverance met with\r\nboundless praise, `Now,' said my wife, `you must come with me, and see\r\nhow little Franz and I have improved our time every day of your\r\nabsence.'\r\n\r\nWe all landed and, with great curiosity, followed my wife up the river\r\ntowards the cascade; where, to our astonishment, we found a garden\r\nneatly laid out in beds and walks; and she continued, `We don't\r\nfrighten people by firing salutes in honour of our performances;\r\nalthough, by and by, I too shall want fire in a peaceable form. Look at\r\nmy beds of lettuce and cabbages, my rows of beans and peas! Think what\r\ndelicious dinners I shall be able to cook for you, and give me credit\r\nfor my diligence.'\r\n\r\n`My dear wife!' I exclaimed. `This is beautiful! You have done\r\nwonders! Did you not find the work too hard?'\r\n\r\n`The ground is light and easy to dig hereabouts,' she replied. `I have\r\nplanted potatoes, and cassava-roots, there is space for sugar-canes,\r\nand the young fruit trees, and I shall want you to contrive to irrigate\r\nthem, by leading water from the cascades in hollow bamboos. Up by the\r\nsheltering rocks I mean to have pineapples* and melons, they will look\r\nsplendid when they spread there. To shelter the beds of European\r\nvegetables from the heat of the sun, I have planted seeds of maize\r\nround them. The shadow of the tall plants will afford protection from\r\nthe burning rays. Do you think that is a good plan?'\r\n\r\n    * The author now thinks pineapples grow on vines. They do not.\r\n\r\n`I do indeed; the whole arrangement is capital. Now, as sunset\r\napproaches, we must return to the tent for supper and rest, for both of\r\nwhich we are all quite ready.'\r\n\r\nThe time passed in happy talk over our many new interests; everyone had\r\nthe pleasant sensation which attends successful labour, as well as\r\nexperiencing the joy of affording unexpected pleasure to others; and I\r\nespecially pointed out to my sons how true, genuine happiness consists\r\nin that, rather than in mere self-gratification.\r\n\r\nNext morning, my wife said: `If you can exist on shore long enough to\r\nvisit Falconhurst, dear husband, I should like you to attend to the\r\nlittle fruit trees. I fear they have been too much neglected. I have\r\nwatered them occasionally, and spread earth over the roots as they lay,\r\nbut I could not manage to plant them.'\r\n\r\n`You have done far more than I could have expected, my wife,' I\r\nreplied, `and provided you do not ask me to give up the sea\r\naltogether, I most willingly agree to your request, and will go to\r\nFalconhurst as soon as the raft is unloaded, and everything safely\r\narranged here.'\r\n\r\nLife on shore was an agreeable change for us all, and the boys went\r\nactively to work, so that the stores were quickly brought up to the\r\ntent, piled in order, and carefully covered with sailcloths, fastened\r\ndown by pegs all round. The pinnace, being provided with an anchor, was\r\nproperly moored, and her elegant appearance quite altered the look of\r\nour harbour, hitherto occupied only by the grotesque tub-boat, and flat\r\nuninteresting raft.\r\n\r\nTaking an ample supply of everything we should require at Falconhurst,\r\nwe were soon comfortably reestablished in that charming abode, its\r\npeaceful shade seeming more delightful than ever, after the heat and\r\nhard work we had lately undergone.\r\n\r\nSeveral Sundays had passed during our stay at Tentholm, and the\r\nwelcome Day of Rest now returned again, to be observed with heartfelt\r\ndevotion and grateful praise. I did not attempt too much in the form of\r\npreaching, as I could not have secured the attention of my hearers to\r\nany long-winded discourses, but they were interested in the Bible\r\nreading and simple instructions I drew from it, and their young voices\r\njoined sweetly in favorite hymns, which my wife sang from memory.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, I desired my boys to let me see their dexterity in\r\nathletic exercises, such as running, leaping, wrestling, and climbing;\r\ntelling them that they must keep up the practise of these things, so as\r\nto grow strong active men, powerful to repel and cope with danger, as\r\nwell as agile and swift-footed to escape from it.\r\n\r\nNo man can be really courageous and self-reliant without an inward\r\nconsciousness of physical power and capability.\r\n\r\n`I want to see my sons strong, both morally and physically,' said I;\r\n`that means, little Franz,' as the large blue eyes looked inquiringly\r\nup at me, `brave to do what is good and right, and to hate evil, and\r\nstrong to work, hunt and provide for themselves and others, and to\r\nfight if necessary.'\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the boys seeming disposed to carry out my wishes\r\nby muscular exercise of all sorts, I encouraged them by saying, I meant\r\nto prepare a curious new weapon for them, only they must promise not to\r\nneglect the practise of archery: as to their guns, I had no reason to\r\nfear they would be laid aside.\r\n\r\nTaking a long cord, I attached a leaden bullet to each end, and had\r\ninstantly to answer a storm of questions as to what this could possibly\r\nbe for.\r\n\r\n`This is a miniature lasso,' said I. `The Mexicans, Patagonians, and\r\nvarious tribes of South America, make use of this weapon in hunting,\r\nwith marvellous dexterity, only, having no bullets, they fasten stones\r\nto their ropes, which are immensely longer than this. One end is swung\r\nround and round the mounted hunter's head, and then cast with skill and\r\nprecision towards the animal he wishes to strike; immediately drawing\r\nit back, he can repeat the blow, and either kill or wound his prey.\r\n\r\n`Frequently, however, the intention is to take the animal, wild horse,\r\nor buffalo, or whatever it may be, alive; and in that case, the lasso\r\nis thrown, while riding in hot pursuit, in such a way as to make the\r\nstone twist many times round the neck, body or legs of the fugitive,\r\narresting him even in full career.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, father, what a splendid contrivance! Will you try it now? There is\r\nthe donkey, father! Do catch the donkey.'\r\n\r\nNot at all certain of my powers, I declined to practise upon a live\r\nsubject, but consented to make a trial of skill by aiming at the stump\r\nof a tree at no great distance.\r\n\r\nMy success surpassed my own expectations; the stump was entwined by the\r\ncord in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever as to the feasibility\r\nof the wonderful performances I described; and I was assailed by\r\npetitions from the boys, each anxious to possess a lasso of his own,\r\nwithout a moment's delay.\r\n\r\nAs the manufacture was simple, their wishes were speedily gratified,\r\nand lasso-practise became the order of the day.\r\n\r\nFritz, who was the most active and adroit, besides having, of course,\r\nthe greatest muscular strength, soon became skilled in the art.\r\n\r\nThat night a change came over the weather, and early next morning I\r\nperceived that a gale of wind was getting up. From the height of our\r\ntrees I could see that the surface of the sea was in violent agitation.\r\n\r\nIt was with no small satisfaction that I thought of our hard-won\r\npinnace, safely moored in the harbour, and recollected that there was\r\nnothing to call us to the wreck for the next few days.\r\n\r\nMy attention was by no means monopolized by my sons and their\r\namusements. The good mother had much to show me demanding my approval,\r\nadvice, or assistance, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nA good supply of wild pigeons and ortolans had been snared, partly\r\ncooked and preserved in lard. Of these she showed me her small cask\r\nwell filled.\r\n\r\nThen the nests of various pairs of tame pigeons were exhibited, but her\r\nchief care was the unpromising condition of her dear little fruit\r\ntrees, for, having been forgotten, they were so dry and withered, that\r\nunless planted without further delay, she feared we should lose them.\r\n\r\nThis needful work we set about, therefore, at once, proposing\r\nafterwards an excursion to the Calabash Wood, in order to manufacture a\r\nlarge supply of vessels and utensils of all sorts and sizes.\r\n\r\nEvery one was inclined for this expedition; consequently the planting\r\nof the orchard was carried on with surprising vigour, but was not\r\ncompleted until towards evening; and then all sorts of arrangements\r\nwere made for an early start next day. My wife and Franz were to be of\r\nthe party, and their equipment took some time, for we meant to make a\r\ngrand family excursion attended by our domestic pets and servants!\r\n\r\nBy sunrise we were all astir, and everything quickly made ready for a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nThe sledge loaded with ammunition and baskets of provisions, and drawn\r\nby the donkey, was to be used for carrying home our gourd\r\nmanufactures, as well as any other prize we might fall in with.\r\n\r\nTurk, as usual, headed the procession, clad in his coat of mail.\r\n\r\nThen came the boys with their guns and game-bags. Their mother and I\r\nfollowed, and behind trotted Juno not in very good spirits, poor\r\ndog!--because Master Knips, who had no idea of being left alone, must\r\nneeds ride on her back.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion I took two guns with me, one loaded with shot for\r\ngame, another with ball for our defence against beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nFlamingo Marsh was quickly crossed, and the magnificent country beyond\r\nlay extended in all its beauty and fertility before our eyes. It was\r\nnew to my wife and two of the boys, and the lovely prospect enchanted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHere Fritz and Jack turned aside into the bush, where presently loud\r\nbarking was followed by the quick report of a gun, and a large bird,\r\nwhich had risen from the thicket, fell heavily to the ground before us.\r\n\r\nFar from resigning itself, however, to death or captivity, it sprang to\r\nits feet, and, unable to fly, rushed away with extraordinary speed,\r\nhotly pursued by the excited dog, while Fritz ran panting in the same\r\ndirection, and Juno, eager to join the chase, sprang aside so suddenly,\r\nthat her rider was flung unceremoniously on the sand, as she darted to\r\nintercept the retreat of the active bird. This she cleverly\r\naccomplished, but its defence was maintained so fiercely, as it struck\r\nout with its powerful legs and sharp claws, that neither Fritz nor the\r\ndogs could master it.\r\n\r\nI hastened to their assistance, and found Juno holding on nobly by the\r\nwing she had seized, while the bird, which proved to be a magnificent\r\nbustard, struggled and fought fiercely. Watching my opportunity, I\r\nthrew a large handkerchief over it, and with difficulty succeeded in\r\nbinding its legs and wings. It was borne in triumph to the rest of our\r\nparty, who meantime had been reclining on the sand.\r\n\r\n`What have you got?'\r\n\r\n`What has Fritz shot?' cried the boys, starting up at our approach.\r\n\r\n`A bustard! Oh, that is splendid!'\r\n\r\n`To be sure, it is the one we missed that day, don't you remember,\r\nmother? Ah, ha! Old fellow, you are done for this time!' said Jack.\r\n\r\n`I think this is a hen bustard, it is the mother bird,' said Ernest.\r\n\r\n`Ah, yes, poor thing!' exclaimed my wife, in a tone of concern. `It is\r\nmost likely the same, and I know she had a brood of young birds, and\r\nnow they will be left unprotected and miserable. Had we not better let\r\nher go?'\r\n\r\n`Why, my dear, kind-hearted wife, that was weeks and weeks ago! Those\r\nlittle birds are all strong and big by this time, and I daresay Mrs.\r\nBustard here has forgotten all about them. Besides, she is badly\r\nwounded, and we must try to cure the hurt. If we succeed, she will be a\r\nvaluable addition to our poultry-yard; if we cannot, you shall roast\r\nher for dinner.'\r\n\r\nResuming our march, we next arrived at the Monkey Grove, which was the\r\nscene of the tragicomic adventure by which Fritz became the guardian of\r\nthe orphan ape.\r\n\r\nWhile he amused us all by a lively and graphic description of the\r\nscene, Ernest was standing apart under a splendid cocoanut palm,\r\ngazing in fixed admiration at the grand height of the stem, and its\r\nbeautiful graceful crown of leaves. The cluster of nuts beneath these\r\nevidently added interest to the spectacle, for, drawing quietly near\r\nhim, I heard a long-drawn sigh, and the words:\r\n\r\n`It's awfully high! I wish one would fall down!' Scarcely had he\r\nuttered these words, than, as if by magic, down plumped a huge nut at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nThe boy was quite startled, and sprang aside, looking timidly upwards,\r\nwhen, to my surprise, down came another.\r\n\r\n`Why, this is just like the fairy tale of the wishing-cap!' cried\r\nErnest. `My wish is granted as soon as formed!'\r\n\r\n`I suspect the fairy in this instance is more anxious to pelt us and\r\ndrive us away, than to bestow dainty gifts upon us,' said I. `I think\r\nthere is most likely a cross-grained old ape sitting up among those\r\nshadowy leaves and branches.'\r\n\r\nWe examined the nuts, thinking they were perhaps old ones, and had\r\nfallen, in consequence, naturally, but they were not even quite ripe.\r\n\r\nAnxious to discover what was in the tree, we all surrounded it, gaping\r\nand gazing upwards with curious eyes.\r\n\r\n`Hollo! I see him!' shouted Fritz presently. `Oh, a hideous creature!\r\nWhat can it be? Flat, round, as big as a plate, and with a pair of\r\nhorrid claws! Here he comes! He is going to creep down the tree!'\r\n\r\nAt this, little Franz slipped behind his mother, Ernest took a glance\r\nround to mark a place of retreat, Jack raised the butt-end of his gun,\r\nand every eye was fixed on the trunk of the tree, down which a large\r\nland-crab commenced a leisurely descent. As it approached within reach,\r\nJack hit at it boldly, when it suddenly dropped the remaining distance,\r\nand opening its great claws, sidled after him with considerable\r\nrapidity, upon which he fairly turned tail and ran.\r\n\r\nWe all burst into a roar of laughter, which soon made him face about,\r\nand then, to our infinite amusement, the little fellow prepared for a\r\nfresh onset; laying down all he was carrying, pulling off his jacket\r\nand spreading it wide out in both hands, he returned to the charge,\r\nsuddenly threw his garment over the creature, wrapped it well round it,\r\nand then pummelled it with all the strength of his fists.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes I could do nothing but laugh, but then running to him\r\nwith my hatchet, I struck several sharp blows on his bundle, which we\r\nopened carefully, and found within the land-crab perfectly dead.\r\n\r\n`Well, this is an ugly rascal!' cried Jack. `If he hadn't been so\r\nhideous, I should not have dealt so severely with him. I wasn't a bit\r\nafraid. What is the creature's name?'\r\n\r\n`This is a crab, a land-crab,' said I, `of which there are many\r\nvarieties, and this, I think, is called a cocoanut crab, or at least it\r\ndeserves the name, for it is evidently very fond of eating these nuts,\r\nsince it takes the trouble to climb the trees for them; the difficulty\r\nof getting at the kernel, too, is considerable. You showed no little\r\npresence of mind, Jack, when you thought of catching it in your jacket;\r\nin fact it might have been more than a match for you otherwise, for\r\nsome are most determined fighters, and are very swift too. Now let us\r\ntake it, as well as the nuts, to the sledge, and go on our way.'\r\n\r\nProgress became difficult, for we were constantly stopped in passing\r\nthrough the wood, by having to cut away the hanging boughs and creeping\r\nplants which interlaced them. Ernest was behind, and by and by called\r\nme back to see what proved to be an important discovery; from the\r\nseveral stalks of one of these creepers flowed clear cold water, and I\r\nrecognized the 'liane rouge', which is known in America, and is so\r\nprecious to the thirsty hunter or traveller.\r\n\r\nThis is truly one of God's good gifts to man! The boys were much\r\ndelighted with this curious plant. `Only fancy, mother,' said Ernest,\r\nas he showed it to her, `how cheering and refreshing to find this if\r\none were lost and alone in a vast forest, wandering for days and days\r\nwithout being near a proper spring of water.'\r\n\r\n`But are you certain it is safe to drink this?' asked she. I assured\r\nher it was so, and advised the boys to cut enough to quench the thirst\r\nof the whole party, including our animals. This they did, only finding\r\nit necessary, as with the sugar canes, to cut air holes above the\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling onward for a short time, we emerged from the thickets\r\ninto open ground, and saw the calabash trees in the distance. As we\r\ndrew near, their curious appearance and singular fruit caused much\r\nsurprise and also amusement, for we were speedily established among the\r\ntrees, where, as I chose and cut down the gourds most likely to be\r\nuseful, every one engaged merrily in the work of cutting, carving,\r\nsawing and scooping some manner of dish, bowl, cup, jar or platter,\r\naccording to his several taste or ability.\r\n\r\nWe were to dine here, and after a time Fritz and Jack began to prepare\r\na fireplace, their great ambition being to heat the stones red hot, and\r\ncook the crab in a hollow gourd. Their mother, therefore, left them to\r\ntheir own devices, and attended to the hungry animals, unharnessing the\r\nass to graze, and giving cocoanut milk to the poor little monkey, who\r\nhad been obliged to travel in a covered basket for some time, lest he\r\nshould be lost in the woods. The wounded bustard had been completely\r\nforgotten, and from heat and thirst was suffering greatly until her\r\nfriendly care revived it, and it was tied to a tree and allowed to move\r\nabout, its fierce spirit greatly tamed by adversity.\r\n\r\nThe cooking operations came to a stand soon after the fire was\r\nlighted, for it appeared that we had no more water in the jars we had\r\nbrought, so the boys proposed to go in search of a spring. I agreed to\r\naccompany them; Ernest also wished to join us, and as our intention was\r\nto examine merely the surrounding wood, I saw no objection to leaving\r\ntheir mother and Franz for a short time.\r\n\r\nVery soon after our exploration began, Ernest, who was in front,\r\nturned with a face of terror, shouting, `A wild boar! An immense wild\r\nboar, father! Do come quick!'\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, I heard a loud snorting and puffing as some large\r\nanimal passed hastily through the thick underwood beyond us. `After\r\nhim, lads, after him!' cried I, hurrying forwards. `Call the dogs!\r\nStand ready to fire!' And we pressed through the bushes to the spot\r\nwhere Ernest had seen the creature.\r\n\r\nThe ground was grubbed up, and some potatoes lay about, showing that we\r\nhad disturbed him at his mid-day meal. Ernest and Jack were more\r\ndisposed to gather the roots than to follow up the chase. Fritz and I\r\nalone went after the dogs, who eagerly pushed on, and by the sounds we\r\nheard had evidently attacked the boar at no great distance. Terrific\r\nbarking, snarling and grunting, guided us to the scene of action, and\r\nwe beheld our mastiffs one on each side of a large respectable-looking\r\npig, holding on by the great ears, while the animal, on seeing us,\r\nappeared rather to beseech our interference than to propose to offer a\r\ndesperate resistance.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the truth became apparent! The captive grunter was no\r\nfierce native of the forest, but our own runaway sow! Our excitement\r\nhad been wound to so high a pitch, that the discovery was quite a\r\nshock, and we felt half angry with the creature who had disappointed\r\nus; then the absurdity of the whole thing made us laugh heartily, and\r\ncalling off the dogs, the old lady was released from her ignominious\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nOur laughter resounding through the wood, brought Ernest and Jack from\r\ntheir potatoes, to see what was going on.\r\n\r\n`Much use you two would have been suppose we had required help,' cried\r\nFritz, as they too recognized their old friend.\r\n\r\n`Ah, well, you see,' returned Jack, `Ernest and I had a sort of a kind\r\nof presentiment that this was going to be the old sow. And just look at\r\nour fine potatoes!'\r\n\r\nA good deal of joking on the subject ensued, but was interrupted by\r\nErnest, who drew our attention to fruit resembling apples on the\r\nsurrounding bushes, and on the grass beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe sow was making amends for the fright and pain she had endured by\r\nmunching and crunching this fruit at a great rate. Fritz feared that it\r\nmight be the poisonous manchineel, against which I once warned them,\r\nbut on examining it, I was induced to pronounce a more favourable\r\nopinion, and we collected a quantity in hopes that, if the monkey\r\napproved of it as well as the old sow, we might be able to enjoy a\r\nfeast ourselves.\r\n\r\nAll this time not a drop of water had we seen, and our own thirst\r\nincreasing, we felt eager to procure some before returning to our\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nJack preceded us, and we made our way towards a high rock, which rose\r\nabove the thickets, when he suddenly startled us by a loud cry of `A\r\ncrocodile! Father! Father! A crocodile!'\r\n\r\n`Nonsense, boy! A crocodile of all things, in this dry, parched\r\nforest, where we can't get so much as a mouthful of water!'\r\n\r\nOn advancing to where Jack stood, I perceived that his mistake was not\r\nso very silly after all, for I beheld an iguana, one of the largest of\r\nthe lizard species, and a truly formidable-looking fellow. I was glad\r\nto assure Jack that the strange creature he had found was perfectly\r\nharmless, and that its flesh being esteemed a delicacy, it would be a\r\nvaluable prize to carry back with us.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Fritz would have fired, but arresting his\r\nhand--`Your shot,' I said, `would probably only wound the animal, and\r\nbeing extremely tenacious of life, it would certainly escape us; we\r\nmust gain possession of the sleeping beauty by a gentler method.'\r\n\r\n`You are not going to kiss it, are you, father?' asked Jack, with a\r\ngrin. I tried to rebuke him for his impertinence, but, failing, I\r\ncommenced operations. I first attached a cord and running-noose to a\r\nstout stick, and holding a light switch in my other hand, I began to\r\napproach the creature with soft, slow steps, while the boys looked on\r\nwith the utmost curiosity.\r\n\r\nPresently I began very softly to whistle a sweet, yet very lively air,\r\nwhich I continued more and more distinctly as I drew near the lizard;\r\nuntil, awaking, it seemed to listen with pleasure--raising its head as\r\nthough better to catch the sounds, or to discover whence they came.\r\n\r\nWhen near enough, I began gently to stroke and tickle him with the\r\nwand, continuing to whistle the prettiest tunes I could think of; and\r\nthe lizard gave signs of pleasurable contentment, stretching his limbs\r\nand moving his tail in token of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, availing myself of a movement of his head, I cast the noose\r\nover it, drew the cord tight and, placing my foot on the body, I was\r\nabout to kill it by piercing the nostril--almost the only vulnerable\r\npart in this singular reptile--when Jack received such a slap from its\r\ntail, which it was furiously driving in all directions, as sent him\r\nrolling over like a nine-pin.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he opened his jaws, when the boys took fright at the\r\nrow of sharp teeth, and thinking that the sooner he was dead the\r\nbetter, were for battering him with sticks; but I assuring them my\r\nmethod would kill him more quickly and without pain, thrust my rod into\r\nhis nostril, on which the blood flowed and the lizard soon expired.\r\n\r\nThe boys seemed to think me as wonderful a person as a snake-charmer,\r\nand the success of my stratagem, as well as of the means by which the\r\nlizard was slain, called forth great admiration, since they never had\r\nheard of the animal, nor of the method of capturing it so commonly\r\npractised in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nNow came the question of how we were to carry this unwieldy burden. I\r\nhad a great dislike to killing any creature and leaving it useless\r\nbehind me; so, without more ado, I fairly took it on my back, and\r\nmarched off with it.\r\n\r\nAs we came towards the Calabash Wood, we could hear the voices of the\r\ndeserted mother and child calling us in anxious tones; for indeed our\r\nprotracted absence alarmed them. We shouted joyously in reply, and our\r\nappearance, as we issued from the woods, afforded them welcome relief\r\nfrom their fears, although the dreadful creature on my back startled\r\nthem not a little.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to tell, so much to be seen, that for a time hunger\r\nand thirst were forgotten; and no one thought even of the water we had\r\nvainly gone in search of, until Master Knips, having slyly possessed\r\nhimself of some of our new-found apples, was discovered munching away\r\nand enjoying them amazingly--which instantly gave the boys a strong\r\nwish to eat some also; and as the bustard likewise pecked at them\r\nwithout hesitation, I felt sure there could be no danger; and on\r\ntasting them, I concluded it was the fruit of the guava, a West Indian\r\nplant, which we were delighted to have.\r\n\r\nAlthough refreshing, this fruit rather sharpened than appeased our\r\nappetites, and we were glad to eat the provisions we had brought from\r\nhome, without waiting to cook anything, as we had originally intended.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, high time to move homewards, and we thought it best\r\nnot to encumber ourselves with the sledge and the greater part of its\r\nload, but to leave it until the next day. The ass was laden with the\r\niguana and the bustard; and little Franz, tired as he was, looked in\r\nvain for a spare seat on its back.\r\n\r\nOur road home lay through a majestic forest of oak trees, beneath\r\nwhich lay numberless acorns, some of which we gathered as we went\r\nalong; and at length, before night closed in, we all reached\r\nFalconhurst in safety. When supper was ready, we were thankful to\r\nrecruit our exhausted strength by eating heartily of a piece of\r\nbroiled iguana, with potatoes and roast acorns, which tasted like\r\nexcellent chestnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done on the following day was to return to the\r\nCalabash Wood, to fetch the sledge with the dishes, bowls and baskets\r\nwe had made.\r\n\r\nFritz alone accompanied me. I desired the other boys to remain with\r\ntheir mother, intending to explore beyond the chain of rocky hills, and\r\nthinking a large party undesirable on the occasion.\r\n\r\nPassing through the wood of evergreen oaks, we observed our sow\r\nfeasting on the acorns, evidently not a whit the worse for the fright\r\nwe had given her the previous day--in fact, she appeared more friendly\r\ndisposed towards us than usual, possibly considering us as her\r\ndeliverers from the jaws of the savage dogs.\r\n\r\nMany birds tenanted this grove, and were undisturbed by our movements,\r\nuntil Fritz fired and shot a beautiful blue jay, and a couple of\r\nparakeets, one a brilliant scarlet, the other green and gold. Fritz was\r\nin the act of reloading his gun, when an unaccountable noise struck our\r\nears, and put us instantly on the alert, because it appeared like the\r\ndull thumping sound of a muffled drum, and reminded us of the possible\r\npresence of savages.\r\n\r\nWith the greatest caution we drew nearer the sound, concealing\r\nourselves among the low bushes and thick grass and creepers, until we\r\nreached an open glade; where, standing on an old prostrate log, was a\r\nbeautiful bird, about the size of a cock, of a rich chestnut brown\r\ncolour, finely mottled with dark brown and grey. On the shoulders were\r\ncurious tufts of velvety black feathers, glossed with green. He was\r\nruffling his wings, erecting his tail and neck feathers, strutting and\r\nwheeling about in a most strange and stately fashion.\r\n\r\nAfter manoeuvring for some time in this manner, greatly to the\r\nedification of a party of birds resembling him but without any ruff,\r\nwho, assembled round the stump, were enjoying his performances, he\r\nspread out his tail like a fan, stiffened his wings, and began to\r\nstrike with them in short, rapid beats, faster and faster, until a\r\nrumbling sound like very distant thunder was produced, and the whirring\r\nwings enveloped him as in a cloud.\r\n\r\nThis was the drumming noise which had alarmed us, increased, as I\r\nimagine, by the wing strokes falling at times on the decayed and\r\nhollow stump on which the curious pantomime was acted.\r\n\r\nI was watching it with the utmost interest, when a shot from behind me\r\nwas fired, and in a moment the play was at an end; my over-hasty son\r\nhad changed the pretty comedy into a sad and needless tragedy. The\r\nenthusiastic drummer fell dead from his perch, and the crowd of\r\nadmiring companions fled in dismay.\r\n\r\nThe cruel interruption of a scene so rare and remarkable annoyed me\r\nextremely, and I blamed Fritz for firing without my leave. I felt sure\r\nthe bird was the ruffed grouse, and a very fine specimen.\r\n\r\nWe placed it on the ass, which was patiently awaiting our return, and\r\nwent on our way.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was quite safe where we had left it; it was early in the\r\nday, and I resolved to explore, as I had intended, the line of cliff\r\nand rocky hills, which, at more or less distance from the seashore,\r\nextended the whole length of coast known or visible to us.\r\n\r\nI desired to discover an opening, if any existed, by which to\r\npenetrate the interior of the country, or to ascertain positively that\r\nwe were walled in and isolated on this portion of the coast. Leaving\r\nCalabash Wood behind us, we advanced over ground covered with manioc,\r\npotatoes and many plants unknown to us; pleasant streamlets watered the\r\nfruitful soil, and the view on all sides was open and agreeable.\r\n\r\nSome bushes attracted my notice, loaded with small white berries, of\r\npeculiar appearance like wax, and very sticky when plucked. I\r\nrecognized in this a plant called by botanists Myrica cerifera, and\r\nwith much pleasure explained to Fritz that, by melting and straining\r\nthese berries, we might easily succeed in making candles, and afford\r\nvery great satisfaction to his mother, who did not at all approve of\r\nhaving to lay her work aside and retire to rest the moment the sun set.\r\n\r\nThe greenish wax to be obtained would be more brittle than bees' wax,\r\nbut it would burn very fairly, and diffuse an agreeable perfume. Having\r\nthe ass with us, we lost no time in gathering berries enough to fill\r\none of the large canvas bags he carried, and we then continued our\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nVery soon we met with another natural curiosity, the curious\r\nappearance of which surprised us much. This was the abode, under one\r\nroof, of a whole colony of birds, about the size of yellowhammers, but\r\nof plain brown plumage. The nests were built in a mass round the stem\r\nand among the branches of a tree standing alone, and a kind of roof\r\nformed of grass, straws and fibres covered them all, and sheltered the\r\ncommunity from rain and the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThere were numbers of openings into the irregular sides of the group of\r\ndwellings, the nests resembling different apartments in a house common\r\nto all; twigs and small branches emerged here and there from the walls,\r\nand served as perches for the young birds, and resting-places and posts\r\nof observation for all. The general appearance of the establishment\r\nreminded us of a huge bath-sponge.\r\n\r\nThe feathered inhabitants swarmed in and out by thousands, and we saw\r\namong them many beautiful little parrots, who seemed in many instances\r\nto contest possession of the nest with the lawful owners.\r\n\r\nFritz, being an expert climber and exceedingly anxious to examine the\r\nnests more closely, ascended the tree, hoping to obtain one or two\r\nyoung birds, if any were hatched. He put his hand into several holes,\r\nwhich were empty; but at last his intended theft and robbery met with\r\nrepulse and chastisement he little expected; for, reaching far back\r\ninto a nest, his finger was seized and sharply bitten by a very strong\r\nbeak, so that with a cry he withdrew his hand, and shook it vigorously\r\nto lessen the pain.\r\n\r\nRecovering from the surprise, he again and more resolutely seized the\r\nunkind bird, and, despite its shrieks and screams, drew it from its\r\nretreat, crammed it into his pocket, buttoned up his coat and slid\r\nquickly to the ground, pursued by numbers of the captive's relations,\r\nwho darted from the other holes and flew round the robber, screeching\r\nand pecking at him in a rage.\r\n\r\nFritz's prize was not one of the real owners of the nests, which were\r\nthose of the sociable grosbeak, but a very pretty, small, green parrot,\r\nwith which he was greatly pleased, and which he at once determined to\r\ntame and teach to speak; for the present, it was carefully remanded to\r\nprison in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThis curious colony of birds afforded us matter of conversation as we\r\nwent on our way; their cheerful sociable habits, and the instinct which\r\nprompted them to unite in labour for the common good, appearing most\r\nwonderful to us.\r\n\r\n`Examples of the kind, however,' said I, `are numerous, in various\r\nclasses of animals. Beavers, for instance, build and live together in a\r\nvery remarkable way. Among insects, bees, wasps, and ants are well\r\nknown as social architects; in like manner, the coral insect works\r\nwonders beneath the ocean waves, by force of perseverance and united\r\neffort.'\r\n\r\n`I have often watched ants at work,' said Fritz; `it is most amusing to\r\nsee how they carry on the various works and duties of their\r\ncommonwealth.'\r\n\r\n`Have you ever noticed how much trouble they take with the eggs?'\r\ninquired I, to see how far he understood the process; `carrying them\r\nabout in the warmth of the sun until they are hatched?'\r\n\r\n`Ah! That is rather the chrysalis of the antworm, or larva, which is\r\nproduced from an egg. I know they are called ants' eggs, but strictly\r\nspeaking, that is incorrect.'\r\n\r\n`You are perfectly right, my boy. Well, if you have taken so much\r\ninterest in watching the little ants of your native country, how\r\ndelighted and astonished you would be to see the wonders performed by\r\nthe vast tribes of large ants in foreign lands.\r\n\r\n`Some of these build heaps or nests, four or six feet high and\r\nproportionately broad, which are so strong and firm that they defy\r\nequally sunshine and rain. They are, within, divided into regular\r\nstreets, galleries, vaults, and nurseries. So firmly are these mounds\r\nbuilt, that with interior alterations, a deserted one might be used for\r\na baking-oven.\r\n\r\n`The ant, although respected since the days of King Solomon as a model\r\nof industry, is not in itself an attractive insect.\r\n\r\n`It exudes a sticky moisture, its smell is unpleasant, and it destroys\r\nand devours whatever eatable comes in its way. Although in our own\r\ncountry it does little harm, the large ants of foreign lands are most\r\ndestructive and troublesome; it being very difficult to check their\r\ndepredations. Fortunately they have enemies by whose exertions their\r\nnumbers are kept down; birds, other insects, and even four-footed\r\nbeasts prey upon them.\r\n\r\n`Chief among the latter is the ant-eater, or tamanoir, of South\r\nAmerica, a large creature six or seven feet in length, covered with\r\nlong coarse hair, drooping like a heavy plume over the hind quarters.\r\nThe head is wonderfully elongated and very narrow; it is destitute of\r\nteeth, and the tongue resembles somewhat a large great red earth-worm.\r\nIt has immensely strong curved claws, with which it tears and breaks\r\ndown and scratches to pieces the hard walls of the ant-heaps; then,\r\nprotruding its sticky tongue, it coils and twists it about among the\r\nterrified millions disturbed by its attack; they adhere to this\r\nhorrible invader, and are drawn irresistibly backward into the hungry,\r\ntoothless jaws awaiting them.\r\n\r\n`The little ant-eater is not more than about twenty-one inches in\r\nlength, has a shorter and more natural looking head, and fine silky\r\nfur. It usually lives in trees.'\r\n\r\nI was pleased to find my memory served me so well on this subject, as\r\nit interested my boy amazingly; and occupied us for a considerable time\r\nwhile we traveled onward.\r\n\r\nArriving presently at a grove of tall trees, with very strong, broad,\r\nthick leaves, we paused to examine them; they bore a round fig-like\r\nfruit, full of little seeds and of a sour harsh taste.\r\n\r\nFritz saw some gummy resin exuding from cracks in the bark, and it\r\nreminded him of the boyish delight afforded by collecting gum from\r\ncherry-trees at home, so that he must needs stop to scrape off as much\r\nas he could. He rejoined me presently, attempting to soften what he had\r\ncollected in his hands; but finding it would not work like gum, he was\r\nabout to fling it away, when he suddenly found that he could stretch\r\nit, and that it sprang back to its original size.\r\n\r\n`Oh father, only look! This gum is quite elastic! Can it possibly be\r\nindia-rubber?'\r\n\r\n`What!' cried I, `Let me see it! A valuable discovery that would be,\r\nindeed; and I do believe you are perfectly right!'\r\n\r\n`Why would it be so very valuable, father?' inquired Fritz. `I have\r\nonly seen it used for rubbing out pencil marks.'\r\n\r\n`India-rubber,' I replied, `or, more properly, caoutchouc, is a milky\r\nresinous juice which flows from certain trees in considerable\r\nquantities when the stem is purposely tapped.\r\n\r\n`These trees are indigenous to the South American countries of Brazil,\r\nGuiana, and Cayenne. The natives, who first obtained it, used it to\r\nform bottles by smearing earthen flasks with repeated coatings of the\r\ngum when just fresh from the trees, and when hardened and sufficiently\r\nthick, they broke the mold, shook out the fragments, and hung the\r\nbottles in the smoke, when they became firmer, and of a dark color.\r\n\r\n`While moist, the savages were in the habit of drawing rude figures and\r\nlines on the resin by way of adornment; these marks you may have\r\nobserved, for the bottles obtained from the natives by the Spaniards\r\nand Portuguese have for years been brought to Europe, and cut into\r\nportions to be sold for use in drawing. Caoutchouc can be put to many\r\nuses, and I am delighted to have it here, as we shall, I hope, be able\r\nto make it into different forms; first and foremost, I shall try to\r\nmanufacture boots and shoes.'\r\n\r\nSoon after making this discovery, we reached the cocoanut wood, and saw\r\nthe bay extending before us, and the great promontory we called Cape\r\nDisappointment, which hitherto had always bounded our excursions. In\r\npassing through the wood, I remarked a smaller sort of palm, which,\r\namong its grand companions, I had not previously noticed. One of these\r\nhad been broken by the wind, and I saw that the pith had a peculiar\r\nmealy appearance, and I felt convinced that this was the world-renowned\r\nsago-palm.\r\n\r\nIn the pith I saw some fat worms or maggots, and suddenly recollected\r\nthat I had heard of them before as feeding on the sago, and that in the\r\nWest Indies they are eaten as a delicacy.\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to try what they tasted like; so at once kindling a\r\nfire, and placing some half dozen, sprinkled with salt, on a little\r\nwooden spit, I set them to roast.\r\n\r\nVery soon rich fat began to drop from them, and they smelt so\r\ntemptingly good, that all repugnance to the idea of eating worms\r\nvanished; and, putting one like a pat of butter on a baked potato, I\r\nboldly swallowed it, and liked it so much, that several others followed\r\nin the same way. Fritz also summoned courage to partake of this novel\r\nfood; which was a savoury addition to our dinner of baked potatoes.\r\n\r\nBeing once more ready to start, we found so dense a thicket in the\r\ndirect route, that we turned aside without attempting to penetrate it,\r\nand made our way towards the sugar-brake near Cape Disappointment. This\r\nwe could not pass without cutting a handsome bundle of sugar-canes, and\r\nthe donkey carried that, in addition to the bag of wax berries.\r\n\r\nIn time we reached the sledge in Calabash Wood: the ass was unloaded,\r\neverything placed on the sledge, and our patient beast began calmly and\r\nreadily to drag the burden he had hitherto borne on his back.\r\n\r\nNo further adventure befell us, and we arrived in the evening at\r\nFalconhurst, where our welcome was as warm as usual--all we had to\r\ntell, listened to with the greatest interest, all we had to show, most\r\neagerly examined, the pretty green parakeet enchanting the boys most\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nAn excellent supper was ready for us, and with thankful hearts we\r\nenjoyed it together; then, ascending to our tree-castle, and drawing up\r\nthe ladder after us, we betook ourselves to the repose well earned and\r\ngreatly needed after this fatiguing day.\r\n\r\nThe idea of candle-making seemed to have taken the fancy of all the\r\nboys; and next morning they woke, one after the other, with the word\r\ncandle on their lips. When they were thoroughly roused they continued\r\nto talk candles; all breakfast-time, candles were the subject of\r\nconversation; and after breakfast they would hear of nothing else but\r\nsetting to work at once and making candles.\r\n\r\n`So be it,' said I, `let us become chandlers.' I spoke confidently,\r\nbut, to tell the truth, I had in my own mind certain misgivings as to\r\nthe result of our experiment. In the first place, I knew that we lacked\r\na very important ingredient--animal fat, which is necessary to make\r\ncandles burn for any length of time with brilliancy. Besides this, I\r\nrather doubted how far my memory would recall the various operations\r\nnecessary in the manufacture.\r\n\r\nOf all this, however, I said nothing; and the boys, under my\r\ndirection, were soon at work. We first picked off the berries and\r\nthrew them into a large shallow iron vessel placed on the fire. The\r\ngreen sweet-scented wax was rapidly melted, rising to the surface of\r\nthe juice yielded by the berries. This we skimmed off and placed in a\r\nseparate pot by the fire, ready for use, repeating the operation\r\nseveral times, until we had collected sufficient liquid wax for our\r\npurpose. I then took the wicks my wife had prepared, and dipped them\r\none after the other into the wax, handing them as I did so to Fritz,\r\nwho hung them up on a bush to dry.\r\n\r\nThe coating they thus obtained, was not very thick; but, by repeating\r\nthe operation several times, they at length assumed very fair\r\nproportions, and became real sturdy candles. Our wax being at an end,\r\nwe hung these in a cool shady place to harden; and that same night we\r\nsat up like civilized beings three whole hours after sunset, and\r\nFalconhurst was for the first time brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nWe were all delighted with the success of our experiment. `You are\r\nindeed clever,' said my wife, `I only wish that with your ingenuity you\r\nwould show me how to make butter. Day after day, I have the annoyance\r\nof seeing a large supply of good cream go bad under my very eyes,\r\nsimply because I have no use to which to put it. Invent a plan, please\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n`I think that perhaps I can help you,' I replied after a little\r\nconsideration, `not that I can claim the honour of the invention of my\r\nplan, that is due to the Hottentots. I will see what I can do. Jack,\r\nbring me one of our gourd bottles.'\r\n\r\nI took the gourd, one of those I had previously prepared, with a small\r\nhole at one end and well hollowed-out and cleaned; this I partially\r\nfilled with cream and then corked up the hole tightly.\r\n\r\n`Here, boys,' said I, `you can continue the operation while I turn\r\ncarpenter and make a cart to take the place of our sledge.' I gave them\r\ntheir directions, and then set about my own work.\r\n\r\nThey fixed four posts in the ground, and to them fastened a square\r\npiece of sailcloth by four cords attached to the corners. In this\r\ncradle they placed the gourd of cream, and each taking a side, rolled\r\nit backwards and forwards continuously for half an hour.\r\n\r\n`Now,' I cried, looking up from my work, `open the gourd and take the\r\ncontents to your mother, with my compliments.'\r\n\r\nThey did so; and my good wife's eyes were delighted with the sight of a\r\nlarge lump of capital fresh butter.\r\n\r\nWith my son's assistance the cart was in time completed; a clumsy\r\nvehicle it was, but strong enough for any purpose to which we might put\r\nit, and, as it proved, of immense use to us in collecting the harvest.\r\n\r\nWe then turned our attention to our fruit trees, which we had planted\r\nin a plot ready for transplanting. The walnut, cherry, and chestnut\r\ntrees we arranged in parallel rows so as to form a shady avenue from\r\nFalconhurst to Family-bridge; and between them we laid down a tolerable\r\nroad, that we might have no difficulty in reaching Tentholm, be the\r\nweather bad as it might.\r\n\r\nWe planted the vines round the arched roots of our great mangrove, and\r\nthe rest of the trees in suitable spots; some near Falconhurst, and\r\nothers away over Jackal river, to adorn Tentholm. Tentholm had been the\r\nsubject of serious thoughts to me for some time past, and I now turned\r\nall my attention thither. It was not my ambition to make it beautiful,\r\nbut to form of it a safe place of refuge in a case of emergency.\r\n\r\nMy first care, therefore, was to plant a thick prickly hedge, capable\r\nof protecting us from any wild animal, and forming a tolerable obstacle\r\nto the attack of even savages, should they appear. Not satisfied with\r\nthis, however, we fortified the bridge, and on a couple of hillocks\r\nmounted two guns which we brought from the wreck, and with whose angry\r\nmouths we might bark defiance at any enemy, man or beast.\r\n\r\nSix weeks slipped away while we were thus busily occupied, six weeks of\r\nhard yet pleasant labour. We greeted each Sunday and its accompanying\r\nrest most gratefully, and on that day always especially thanked God for\r\nour continued health and safety.\r\n\r\nI soon saw that this hard work was developing in the boys remarkable\r\nstrength, and this I encouraged by making them practise running,\r\nleaping, climbing, and swimming; I also saw, however, that it was\r\nhaving a less satisfactory effect upon their clothes, which, though a\r\nshort time before remarkably neat, were now, in spite of mending and\r\npatching, most untidy and disreputable.\r\n\r\nI determined, therefore, to pay another visit to the wreck, to\r\nreplenish our wardrobe and to see how much longer the vessel was\r\nlikely to hold together. Three of the boys and I went off in the\r\npinnace. The old ship seemed in much the same condition as when we had\r\nleft her, a few more planks had gone, but that was all.\r\n\r\n`Come, boys,' cried I, `not an article of the slightest value must be\r\nleft on board; rummage her out to the very bottom of her hold.'\r\n\r\nThey took me at my word: sailors' chests, bales of cloth and linen, a\r\ncouple of small guns, ball and shot, tables, benches, window shutters,\r\nbolts and locks, barrels of pitch, all were soon in a heap on the deck.\r\nWe loaded the pinnace and went on shore.\r\n\r\nWe soon returned with our tub-boat in tow, and after a few more trips\r\nnothing was left on board.\r\n\r\n`One more trip,' said I to my wife, before we started again, `and\r\nthere will be the end of the brave ship which carried us from\r\nSwitzerland. I have left two barrels of gunpowder on board, and mean to\r\nblow her up.'\r\n\r\nBefore we lighted the fuse, I discovered a large copper cauldron which\r\nI thought I might save. I made fast to it a couple of empty casks, that\r\nwhen the ship went up it might float. The barrels were placed, the\r\ntrain lighted, and we returned on shore.\r\n\r\nThe supper was laid outside the tent, at a spot from whence we might\r\nobtain a good view of the wreck. Darkness came on. Suddenly a vivid\r\npillar of fire rose from the black waters, a sullen roar boomed across\r\nthe sea, and we knew that our good old ship was no more.\r\n\r\nWe had planned the destruction of the vessel, we knew that it was for\r\nthe best; and yet that night we went to bed with a feeling of sadness\r\nin our hearts, as though we had lost a dear old friend.\r\n\r\nNext morning all our sadness was dispelled, and it was with pleasure\r\nthat we saw the shore lined with a rich store of planks and beams, the\r\nremnants of the wreck. I soon found, too, the copper cauldron which was\r\nsuccessfully floated by the casks; this I got on shore, and hauling it\r\nup among the rocks, stored under it the powder casks we had landed the\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nCollecting all these valuables gave us some little trouble, and while\r\nwe were thus engaged my wife brought us good news. She had discovered\r\nthat two ducks and a goose had each reared a large family among the\r\nreeds by the river; and they presently appeared waddling past us,\r\napparently vastly well-pleased with their performance. We greeted them\r\njoyfully.\r\n\r\n`Hurrah!' cried Ernest. `We'll be able to afford duck and green peas\r\nsome day soon, and imagine we're once more civilized mortals.'\r\n\r\nThe sight of these birds reminded me of our family at Falconhurst, and\r\nI announced my intention of paying them a visit.\r\n\r\nEveryone was delighted, and everyone would come with me. As we\r\napproached Falconhurst I noticed that several young trees in our\r\navenue were considerably bent by the wind, and this resolved me to make\r\nan expedition next day to cut bamboos for their support.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz was the only one besides myself who had visited Cape\r\nDisappointment and the surrounding country, my wife and the younger\r\nboys begged hard to be allowed to accompany me. I consented; and next\r\nmorning we started, bringing with us the cart, drawn by the cow and\r\nass, and laden with everything necessary for an expedition of several\r\ndays--a tent, provisions, a large supply of ammunition, and all sorts\r\nof implements and utensils; for I intended to make a great collection\r\nof fruits and the produce of different trees.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning, and passing gaily through the plantations of\r\npotatoes, manioc and cassavas, we came to the nests of the sociable\r\ngrosbeak, the sight of which charmed the children immensely.\r\n\r\nWe reached the wax trees, and there I called a halt, for I wished to\r\ngather a sack or two of the berries that we might renew our stock of\r\ncandles. The berries were soon plucked; and I stored them away amongst\r\nthe bushes, marking the spot that we might find them on our return.\r\n\r\n`Now for the caoutchouc tree,' said I, `now for waterproof boots and\r\nleggings to keep your feet dry, Ernest.' To the caoutchouc tree we\r\ndirected our steps, and were soon busily engaged in stabbing the bark\r\nand placing vessels beneath to catch the sap.\r\n\r\nWe again moved forward; and, crossing the palm wood, entered upon a\r\ndelightful plain bounded on one side by an extensive field of waving\r\nsugar-cane, on the other by a thicket of bamboos and lovely palms,\r\nwhile in front stretched the shining sea, calm and noiseless.\r\n\r\n`How beautiful!' exclaimed Jack. `Let us pitch our tent here and stay\r\nhere always instead of living at Falconhurst. It would be jolly.'\r\n\r\n`Very likely,' replied I, `and so would be the attacks of wild beasts;\r\nimagine a great tiger lying in wait in the thicket yonder, and pouncing\r\nout on us at night. No, no, thank you, I much prefer our nest in the\r\ntree, or our impregnable position at Tentholm. We must make this our\r\nheadquarters for the present, however; for, though perhaps dangerous,\r\nit is the most convenient spot we shall find. Call a halt and pitch the\r\ntent.'\r\n\r\nOur beasts were quickly unyoked, the tent arranged, a large fire lit,\r\nsupper prepared, and we dispersed in various directions, some to cut\r\nbamboos, and some to collect sugar-cane. We then returned; and, as\r\nsupper was still not quite ready and the boys were hungry, they decided\r\nto obtain some cocoanuts. This time, however, no assistance was to be\r\nhad from either monkeys or land-crabs, and they gazed up with longing\r\neyes at the fruit above them.\r\n\r\n`We can climb,' said Fritz, `up with you, boys.' Jack and he each\r\nrushed at one of the smooth slippery trunks; right vigorously they\r\nstruggled upwards, but to no purpose; before they had accomplished one\r\nquarter of the distance they found themselves slipping rapidly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n`Here, you young athletes,' cried I, `I foresaw this difficulty, and\r\nhave provided for it.' So saying I held up buskins of shark's skin\r\nwhich I had previously prepared, and which I now bound on to their\r\nlegs. Thus equipped they again attempted the ascent, and with a loop of\r\nrope passed round their body and the trunk of the tree, quickly reached\r\nthe summit.\r\n\r\nMy wife joined me, and together we watched the boys as they ascended\r\ntree after tree, throwing down the best fruit from each. They then\r\nreturned, and jestingly begged Ernest to produce the result of his\r\nlabour. The professor had been lying on the grass gazing at the palms;\r\nbut, on this sarcastic remark, he sprang to his feet. `Willingly,' he\r\nexclaimed, and seizing a pair of buskins he quickly donned them.\r\n\r\n`Give me a cocoanut shell,' said he. I gave him one, and he put it in\r\nhis pocket. He ran to a tree, and, with an agility which surprised us\r\nall, quickly reached the top.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he done so than Fritz and Jack burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter. He had swarmed a tree which bore no nuts. Ernest apparently\r\nheard them; for, as it seemed in a fit of anger, he drew his knife and\r\nsevered the leafy crest, which fell to the ground. I glanced up at him,\r\nsurprised at such a display of temper. But a bright smile greeted me,\r\nand in a merry tone he shouted:\r\n\r\n`Jack, pick that palm-cabbage up and take it to father; that is only\r\nhalf my contribution, and it is worth all your nuts put together.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke truly: the cabbage-palm is rare, and the tuft of leaves at its\r\nsummit is greatly prized by the South Americans for its great delicacy\r\nand highly nutritive qualities.\r\n\r\n`Bravo!' I cried. `You have retrieved your character; come down and\r\nreceive the thanks of the company, what are you waiting up there for?'\r\n\r\n`I am coming presently,' he replied, `with the second half of my\r\ncontribution; I hope it will be as fully appreciated as the first.' In\r\na short time he slipped down the tree, and, advancing to his mother,\r\npresented her with the nutshell he had taken up with him.\r\n\r\n`Here,' he said, `is a wine which the greatest connoisseur would\r\nprize. Taste it, mother.'\r\n\r\nThe shell was filled with a clear rosy liquor, bright and sparkling.\r\n\r\nMy wife tasted it. `Excellent, excellent,' she exclaimed. `Your very\r\ngood health, my dear boy!'\r\n\r\nWe drank the rosy wine in turn, and Ernest received hearty thanks from\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late, and while we were enjoying our supper before our\r\ntent, our donkey, who had been quietly browsing near us, suddenly set\r\nup a loud bray, and, without the least apparent cause, pricked up his\r\nears, threw up his heels, and galloped off into the thicket of bamboos.\r\nWe followed for a short distance, and I sent the dogs in chase, but\r\nthey returned without our friend, and, as it was late, we were obliged\r\nto abandon the chase.\r\n\r\nI was annoyed by this incident, and even alarmed; for not only had we\r\nlost the ass, but I knew not what had occasioned his sudden flight. I\r\nknew not whether he was aware, by instinct, of the approach of some\r\nfierce wild beast. I said nothing of this to my family, but, making up\r\nan unusually large fire, I bade them sleep with their weapons by their\r\nsides, and we all lay down.\r\n\r\nA bright morning awoke us early, and I rose and looked out, thinking\r\nthat perhaps our poor donkey might have been attracted by the light of\r\nthe fires, and have returned. Alas, not a sign of him was to be seen.\r\nAs we could not afford to lose so valuable a beast, I determined to\r\nleave no attempt untried to regain him.\r\n\r\nWe hurriedly breakfasted, and, as I required the dogs to assist me in\r\nthe search, I left my elder sons to protect their mother, and bade Jack\r\nget ready for a day's march. This arrangement delighted him, and we\r\nquickly set out.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or more we trudged onwards, directed by the print of the\r\nass's hoofs. Sometimes we lost the track for a while, and then again\r\ndiscovered it as we reached softer soil. Finally this guide failed us\r\naltogether, for the donkey seemed to have joined in with a herd of some\r\nlarger animals, with whose hoof-prints his had mingled.\r\n\r\nI now almost turned back in despair, but Jack urged me to continue the\r\nsearch. `For,' said he, `if we once get upon a hill we shall see such a\r\nlarge herd as this must be at almost any distance. Do let us go on,\r\nfather.'\r\n\r\nI consented, and we again pushed forwards, through bushes, and over\r\ntorrents, sometimes cutting our way with an axe, and sometimes plunging\r\nknee-deep through a swamp. We at length reached the border of a wide\r\nplain, and on it, in the distance, I could see a herd of animals,\r\nbrowsing on the rich grass. It struck me that it might be the very herd\r\nto which our good donkey had joined himself; and, wishing to ascertain\r\nwhether this was so, I resolved to make a detour through a bamboo\r\nmarsh, and get as near as possible to the animals without disturbing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe bamboos were huge, many of them over thirty feet in height; and, as\r\nwe made our way through them, I remembered an account of the giant cane\r\nof South America, which is greatly prized by the Indians on account of\r\nits extreme usefulness; the reeds themselves make masts for their\r\ncanoes, while each joint will form a cask or box.\r\n\r\nI was delighted, for I had little doubt that the bamboos we were among\r\nwere of the same species. I explained this to Jack, and as we discussed\r\nthe possibility of cutting one down and carrying a portion of it home,\r\nwe reached the border of the marsh, and emerged upon the plain.\r\n\r\nThere we suddenly found ourselves face to face with the herd which we\r\nsought--a herd of buffaloes. They looked up, and stared at us\r\ninquisitively, but without moving. Jack would have fired, but I checked\r\nhim. `Back to the thicket,' I said, `and keep back the dogs!'\r\n\r\nWe began to retreat, but before we were again under cover, the dogs\r\njoined us; and, in spite of our shouts and efforts to restrain them,\r\nthey dashed forwards, and seized a buffalo calf.\r\n\r\nThis was a signal to the whole herd to attack us. They bellowed\r\nloudly, pawed the ground, and tore it up with their horns, and then\r\ndashed madly towards us. We had not time to step behind a rock before\r\nthe leader was upon us. So close was he that my gun was useless. I drew\r\na pistol and fired. He fell dead at my feet.\r\n\r\nHis fall checked the advance of the rest. They halted, snuffed the air,\r\nturned tail and galloped off across the plain. They were gone, but the\r\ndogs still held gallantly to the calf. They dragged and tussled with\r\nhim, but with their utmost efforts could not bring him to the ground.\r\n\r\nHow to assist them without shooting the poor beast, I knew not; and\r\nthis I was unwilling to do, for I hoped that, if we could but capture\r\nhim alive, we might in time manage to tame him, and use him as a beast\r\nof burden. Jack's clever little head, however, suddenly devised a plan\r\nfor their aid, and with his usual promptitude he at once put it into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nHe unwound the lasso, which was coiled round his body, and, as the\r\nyoung bull flung up his heels, he cast it and caught him by his hind\r\nlegs. The noose drew tight, and in a twinkling the beast was upon the\r\nground. We fastened the other end of the cord round a stout bamboo,\r\ncalled off the dogs, and the animal was at our mercy.\r\n\r\n`Now we have got him,' said Jack, as he looked at the poor beast,\r\nlying panting on the ground, `what are we to do with him?'\r\n\r\n`I will show you,' said I; `help me to fasten his forelegs together,\r\nand you shall see the next operation.'\r\n\r\nThe bull, thus secured, could not move; and while Jack held his head I\r\ndrew my knife and pierced the cartilage of his nose, and when the blood\r\nflowed less freely, passed a stout cord through the hole. I felt some\r\nrepugnance at thus paining the animal, but it was a case of necessity,\r\nand I could not hesitate. We united the ends of the cord, freed the\r\nanimal, set him upon his legs, and subdued and overawed, he followed us\r\nwithout resistance.\r\n\r\nI now turned my attention to the dead buffalo, but as I could not then\r\nskin it, I contented myself with cutting off the most delicate parts,\r\nits tongue, and a couple of steaks, and, packing them in salt in my\r\nwallet, abandoned the rest to the dogs. They fell upon it greedily, and\r\nwe retired under the shade to enjoy a meal after our hard work.\r\n\r\nThe dogs, however, were not to have undisputed possession of the\r\ncarcase; vultures, crows and other birds of prey, with that marvellous\r\ninstinct which always leads them to a dead body, quickly filled the\r\nair, and, with discordant cries, swooped down upon the buffalo. An\r\namusing contest ensued; the dogs again and again drove off the\r\nintruders, and they, as often, returned reinforced by others who\r\nswarmed to the spot. Jack, with his usual impetuosity, wished to send a\r\nshot in amongst the robber band, but I prevented him, for I knew that\r\nthe bird or two he might kill would be of no use to us, while his shot\r\nwould not drive away the rest, even had we wished it.\r\n\r\nBoth we and the dogs were at length satisfied, and as it was getting\r\nlate, I determined to give up for the present the search for the ass,\r\nand to return to our camp.\r\n\r\nWe again made our way through the bamboos, but before we left the\r\nthicket, I cut down one of the smallest of the reeds, the largest of\r\nwhose joints would form capital little barrels, while those near the\r\ntapering top would serve as moulds for our next batch of candles.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, with a dog on either side and the rope through his nose,\r\nwas following us passively, and we presently induced him to submit to a\r\npackage of our goods laid upon his back. We pushed rapidly forward,\r\nJack eager to display our latest acquisition.\r\n\r\nAs we repassed the rocky bed of a stream we had crossed in the\r\nmorning, Juno dashed ahead, and was about to rush into a cleft between\r\nthe rocks, when the appearance of a large jackal suddenly checked her\r\nfurther progress. Both dogs instantly flew at the animal, and though\r\nshe fought desperately, quickly overpowered and throttled her. From the\r\nway the beast had shown fight, I concluded that her young must be close\r\nby, probably within the very cleft Juno was about to enter.\r\n\r\nDirectly Jack heard this, he wished to creep in and bring out the\r\nyoung jackals. I hesitated to allow him to do so, for I thought it\r\npossible that the male jackal might be still lying in wait within the\r\ncave. We peered into the darkness, and after a while, Jack declared he\r\ncould discern the little yellow jackals, and that he was quite sure the\r\nold one was not there.\r\n\r\nHe then crept in, followed closely by the dogs, and presently emerged\r\nbearing in his arms a handsome cub of a beautiful golden yellow and\r\nabout the size of a small cat. He was the only one of the brood he had\r\nmanaged to save, for Turk and Juno, without pity for their youth or\r\nbeauty, had worried all the rest. I did not much regret this, however,\r\nfor I firmly believe that, had he saved them, Jack would have insisted\r\nupon bringing up the whole litter. As it was I considered that one\r\njackal was, with our young bull, quite sufficient an addition to our\r\nlivestock.\r\n\r\nDuring the halt we had made, I had fastened the buffalo to a small\r\ntree, and as I now was again about to move on, I recognized it as the\r\ndwarf-palm, whose long sharp leaves form an excellent barrier if it is\r\nplanted as a hedge. I determined to return and get some young plants to\r\nstrengthen our hedge at Tentholm. It was late before we reached our\r\ncamp, where we found our family anxiously awaiting our return.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the new animals delighted the children immensely, and in\r\ntheir opinion amply compensated for the loss of our poor donkey. Jack\r\nhad to answer a host of questions concerning their capture, and to give\r\na minute account of the affray with the buffaloes. This he did, with\r\ngraphic power certainly, but with so much boasting and\r\nself-glorification, that I was obliged to check him, and give a plain\r\nand unvarnished account of the affair.\r\n\r\nSupper-time arrived, and as we sat at that meal, for which Jack and I\r\nwere heartily thankful, my wife and her party proceeded to give an\r\naccount of their day's work.\r\n\r\nErnest had discovered a sago-palm, and had, after much labour,\r\ncontrived to fell it. Franz and his mother had collected dry wood, of\r\nwhich a huge heap now stood before the tent sufficient to keep up a\r\nfire all the rest of the time we should stay on the spot.\r\n\r\nFritz had gone off shooting and had secured a good bag. While they had\r\nbeen thus variously employed, a troop of apes had visited the tent, and\r\nwhen they returned, they found the place ransacked and turned upside\r\ndown. The provisions were eaten and gnawed, the potatoes thrown about,\r\nthe milk drunk and spilt, every box had been peeped into, every pot and\r\npan had been divested of its lid, the palisade round the hut had been\r\npartly destroyed, nothing had been left untouched.\r\n\r\nIndustriously had the boys worked to repair the damage, and when we\r\nreturned not a sign was to be seen of the disorder. No one would have\r\nguessed what had occurred from the delicious supper we were eating.\r\n\r\nAfter matters had been again arranged, Fritz had gone down to the\r\nshore and, amongst the rocks at Cape Disappointment, had discovered a\r\nyoung eaglet which Ernest declared to be a Malabar or Indian eagle; he\r\nwas much pleased with his discovery, and I recommended him to bring the\r\nbird up and try to train it to hunt as a falcon.\r\n\r\n`Look here though, boys,' said I, `you are now collecting a good many\r\npets, and I am not going to have your mother troubled with the care of\r\nthem all; each must look after his own, and if I find one neglected,\r\nwhether beast or bird, I set it at liberty. Mark that and remember it!'\r\n\r\nMy wife looked greatly relieved at this announcement, and the boys\r\npromised to obey my directions. Before we retired for the night I\r\nprepared the buffalo-meat I had brought; I lit a large fire of green\r\nwood, and in the smoke of this thoroughly dried both the tongue and\r\nsteaks. We then properly secured all the animals, Jack took his little\r\npet in his arms, and we lay down and were soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak we were on foot, and began to prepare for a return to\r\nFalconhurst.\r\n\r\n`You are not going to despise my sago, I hope,' said Ernest, `you have\r\nno idea what a trouble it was to cut it down, and I have been thinking\r\ntoo that if we could but split the tree, we might make a couple of long\r\nuseful troughs which might, I think, be made to carry water from Jackal\r\nRiver to Tentholm. Is my plan worth consideration?'\r\n\r\n`Indeed it is,' I replied, `and at all events we must not abandon such\r\na valuable prize as a sago-palm. I would put off our departure for a\r\nday, rather than leave it behind.'\r\n\r\nWe went to the palm, and with the tools we had with us attempted to\r\nsplit the trunk. We first sawed off the upper end, and then with an axe\r\nand saw managed to insert a wedge. This accomplished, our task was less\r\ndifficult, for with a heavy mallet we forced the wedge in further and\r\nfurther, until at length the trunk was split in twain. From one half of\r\nthe trunk we then removed the pith, disengaging it, with difficulty,\r\nfrom the tough wood fibres; at each end, however, I left a portion of\r\nthe pith untouched, thus forming a trough in which to work the sago.\r\n\r\n`Now, boys,' said I, when we had removed the pith from the other half\r\nof the trunk, `off with your coats and turn up your shirt-sleeves; I am\r\ngoing to teach you to knead.'\r\n\r\nThey were all delighted, and even little Franz begged to be allowed to\r\nhelp. Ernest brought a couple of pitchers of water, and throwing it in\r\namongst the pith, we set to work right heartily. As the dough was\r\nformed and properly kneaded, I handed it to my wife who spread it out\r\non a cloth in the sun to dry. This new occupation kept us busy until\r\nthe evening, and when it was at length completed we loaded the cart\r\nwith the sago, a store of cocoanuts and our other possessions, that we\r\nmight be ready to start early on the following morning.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose above the horizon, we packed up our tent and set\r\nforth, a goodly caravan. I thought it unfair to the cow to make her\r\ndrag such a load as we now had alone, and determined if possible to\r\nmake the young buffalo take the place of our lost donkey; after some\r\npersuasion he consented, and soon put his strength to the work and\r\nbrought the cart along famously. As we had the trough slung under the\r\ncart we had to choose the clearest possible route, avoiding anything\r\nlike a thicket; we, therefore, could not pass directly by the\r\ncandleberry and caoutchouc trees, and I sent Ernest and Jack aside to\r\nvisit the store we had made on our outward journey.\r\n\r\nThey had not long been gone when I was alarmed by a most terrible\r\nnoise accompanied by the furious barking of the dog and shouts from\r\nJack and Ernest. Thinking that the boys had been attacked by some wild\r\nbeast, I ran to their assistance.\r\n\r\nA most ludicrous scene awaited me when I reached the spot. They were\r\ndancing and shouting round and round a grassy glade, and I as nearly as\r\npossible followed their example, for in the centre, surrounded by a\r\npromising litter, lay our old sow, whose squeals, previously so\r\nalarming, were now subsiding into comfortable grunts of recognition.\r\n\r\nI did not join my boys in their triumphal dance, but I was\r\nnevertheless very much pleased at the sight of the flourishing family,\r\nand immediately returned to the cart to obtain biscuits and potatoes\r\nfor the benefit of the happy mother. Jack and Ernest meanwhile pushed\r\nfurther on, and brought back the sack of candleberries and the\r\ncaoutchouc, and as we could not then take the sow with us, we left her\r\nalone with her family and proceeded to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nThe animals were delighted to see us back again, and received us with\r\nmanifestations of joy, but looked askance at the new pets.\r\n\r\nThe eagle especially came in for shy glances, and promised to be no\r\nfavourite. Fritz, however, determined that his pet should at present do\r\nno harm, secured him by the leg to a root of the fig-tree and uncovered\r\nhis eyes. In a moment the aspect of the bird was changed; with his\r\nsight returned all his savage instincts, he flapped his wings, raised\r\nhis head, darted to the full length of his chain, and before anyone\r\ncould prevent him seized the unfortunate parrot which stood near, and\r\ntore it to pieces. Fritz's anger rose at the sight, and he was about to\r\nput an end to the savage bird.\r\n\r\n`Stop,' said Ernest, `don't kill the poor creature, he is but\r\nfollowing his natural instincts; give him to me, and I will tame him.'\r\n\r\nFritz hesitated. `No, no,' he said, `I don't want really to kill the\r\nbird, but I can't give him up; tell me how to tame him, and you shall\r\nhave Master Knips.'\r\n\r\n`Very well,' replied Ernest, `I will tell you my plan, and, if it\r\nsucceeds, I will accept Knips as a mark of your gratitude. Take a pipe\r\nand tobacco, and send the smoke all round his head, so that he must\r\ninhale it; by degrees he will become stupefied, and his savage nature\r\nfrom that moment subdued.'\r\n\r\nFritz was rather inclined to ridicule the plan, but knowing that\r\nErnest generally had a good reason for anything of the sort that he\r\nproposed, he consented to make the attempt. He soon seated himself\r\nbeneath the bird, who still struggled furiously, and puffed cloud after\r\ncloud upwards, and as each cloud circled round the eagle's head he\r\nbecame quieter and quieter, until he sat quite still, gazing stupidly\r\nat the young smoker.\r\n\r\n`Capital!' cried Fritz, as he hooded the bird, `capital, Ernest; Knips\r\nis yours.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nNext morning the boys and I started with the cart laden with our\r\nbundles of bamboos to attend to the avenue of fruit trees. The buffalo\r\nwe left behind, for his services were not needed, and I wished the\r\nwound in his nostrils to become completely cicatrized before I again\r\nput him to work.\r\n\r\nWe were not a moment too soon; many of the young trees which before\r\nthreatened to fall had now fulfilled their promise, and were lying\r\nprostrate on the ground, others were bent, some few only remained\r\nerect. We raised the trees, and digging deeply at their roots, drove in\r\nstout bamboo props, to which we lashed them firmly with strong broad\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\n`Papa,' said Franz, as we were thus engaged, and he handed me the\r\nfibres as I required them, `are these wild or tame trees?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, these are wild trees, most ferocious trees,' laughed Jack, `and we\r\nare tying them up lest they should run away, and in a little while we\r\nwill untie them and they will trot about after us and give us fruit\r\nwherever we go. Oh, we will tame them; they shall have a ring through\r\ntheir noses like the buffalo!'\r\n\r\n`That's not true,' replied Franz, gravely, `but there are wild and tame\r\ntrees, the wild ones grow out in the woods like the crab-apples, and\r\nthe tame ones in the garden like the pears and peaches at home. Which\r\nare these, papa?'\r\n\r\n`They are not wild,' I replied, `but grafted or cultivated or, as you\r\ncall them, tame trees. No European tree bears good fruit until it is\r\ngrafted!' I saw a puzzled look come over the little boy's face as he\r\nheard this new word, and I hastened to explain it.\r\n\r\n`Grafting,' I continued, `is the process of inserting a slip or twig of\r\na tree into what is called an eye; that is, a knot or hole in the\r\nbranch of another. This twig or slip then grows and produces, not such\r\nfruit as the original stock would have borne, but such as the tree from\r\nwhich it was taken would have produced. Thus, if we have a sour crab\r\ntree, and an apple tree bearing fine ribston pippins, we would take a\r\nslip of the latter, insert it in an eye of the former, and in a year or\r\ntwo the branch which it would then grow would be laden with good\r\napples.'\r\n\r\n`But,' asked Ernest, `where did the slips of good fruit come from, if\r\nnone grow without grafting?'\r\n\r\n`From foreign countries,' I replied. `It is only in the cold climate of\r\nour part of the world that they require this grafting; in many parts of\r\nthe world, in more southern latitudes than ours, the most luscious\r\nfruit trees are indigenous to the soil, and flourish and bear sweet,\r\nwholesome fruit, without the slightest care of attention being bestowed\r\nupon them; while in England and Germany, and even in France, these same\r\ntrees require the utmost exertion of horticultural skills to make them\r\nbring forth any fruit whatever.\r\n\r\n`Thus, when the Romans invaded England they found nothing in the way of\r\nfruit trees but the crab-apple, nut bushes, and bramble bushes, but by\r\ngrafting on these, fine apples, filberts, and raspberries were\r\nproduced, and it was the same in our own dear Switzerland--all our\r\nfruit trees were imported.'\r\n\r\n`Were cherries, father? May we not even call cherries Swiss? I always\r\nthought they grew nowhere else.'\r\n\r\n`I am afraid we cannot even claim cherries as our own, not even the\r\nname of them; they are called cherries from Cerasus, a state of Pontus,\r\nin Asia, whence they were brought to Europe by Lucullus, a Roman\r\ngeneral, about seventy years before Christ.\r\n\r\n`Hazelnuts also come from Pontus; walnuts, again, came originally from\r\nPersia. As for grapes, they are of the greatest antiquity. We hear, if\r\nyou remember, of Noah cultivating vines, and they have been brought\r\nfrom one place to another until they now are to be found in most parts\r\nof the civilized world.'\r\n\r\n`Do you think all these trees will grow?' asked Fritz, as we crossed\r\nJackal River and entered our plantation at Tentholm. `Here are lemons,\r\npomegranates, pistachio nuts, and mulberries.'\r\n\r\n`I have little doubt of it,' I replied, `we are evidently within the\r\ntropics, where such trees as these are sure to flourish.\r\n\r\n`These pines, now, come from France, Spain, and Italy; the olives from\r\nArmenia and Palestine; the figs originally from the island of Chios;\r\nthe preaches and apricots from Persia; plums from Damascus in Syria,\r\nand the pears of all sorts from Greece.\r\n\r\n`However, if our countries have not been blessed in the same way with\r\nfruit, we have been given wisdom and skill, which has enabled us to\r\nimport and cultivate the trees of other lands.'\r\n\r\nWe thus talked and worked until every tree that required the treatment\r\nwas provided with a stout bamboo prop, and then, with appetites which a\r\ngourmand might well have envied, we returned to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nI think my good wife was almost alarmed at the way we fell upon the\r\ncorned beef and palm-cabbage she set before us, but at length these\r\ngood things produced the desired effect, and one after another declared\r\nhimself satisfied. As we sat reclining after our labour and digesting\r\nour dinner we discussed the various projects we had in contemplation.\r\n\r\n`I wish,' said my wife, `that you would invent some other plan for\r\nclimbing to the nest above us; I think that the nest itself is perfect,\r\nI really wish for nothing better, but I should like to be able to get\r\nto it without scaling that dreadful ladder every time; could you not\r\nmake a flight of steps to reach it?'\r\n\r\nI carefully thought over the project, and turned over every plan for\r\nits accomplishment.\r\n\r\n`It would be impossible, I am afraid,' said I, `to make stairs\r\noutside, but within the trunk it might be done. More than once have I\r\nthought that this trunk might be hollow or partly so, and if such be\r\nthe case our task would be comparatively easy. Did you not tell me the\r\nother day that you noticed bees coming from a hole in the tree?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, yes,' said little Franz, `and I went to look at them and one flew\r\nright against my face and stung me, and I almost cried, but I didn't.'\r\n\r\n`Brave little boy,' said I. `Well, now, if the trunk be sufficiently\r\nhollow to contain a swarm of bees, it may be for all we can tell hollow\r\nthe greater part of its length, for like the willow in our own country\r\nit might draw all its nourishment through the bark, and in spite of its\r\nreal unsoundness retain a flourishing appearance.'\r\n\r\nMaster Jack, practical as usual, instantly sprang to his feet to put my\r\nconjecture to the proof. The rest followed his example, and they were\r\nall soon climbing about like squirrels peeping into the hole, and\r\ntapping the wood to discover by sound how far down the cavity extended.\r\n\r\nThey forgot, in their eagerness, who were the tenants of this\r\ninteresting trunk. They were soon reminded of it, however, for the\r\nbees, disturbed by this unusual noise, with an angry buzz burst out and\r\nin an instant attacked the causers of the annoyance; they swarmed round\r\nthem, stung them on the hands, face, and neck, settled in their hair,\r\nand pursued them as they ran to me for assistance.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that we got rid of the angry insects, and were\r\nable to attend to the boys. Jack, who had been the first to reach the\r\nhole, had fared the worst and was soon a most pitiable sight, his face\r\nswelled to an extraordinary degree, and it was only by the constant\r\napplication of cold earth that the pain was alleviated. They were all\r\neager to commence an organized attack upon the bees at once, but for an\r\nhour or more by reason of their pain they were unable to render me much\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile I made my arrangements. I first took a large calabash\r\ngourd, for I intended to make a beehive, that, when we had driven the\r\ninsects from their present abode, we might not lose them entirely. The\r\nlower half of the gourd I flattened, I then cut an arched opening in\r\nthe front for a doorway, made a straw roof as a protection from the\r\nrain and heat, and the little house was complete.\r\n\r\nNothing more however could then be done, for the irritated bees were\r\nstill angrily buzzing round the tree. I waited till dark, and then when\r\nall the bees had again returned to their trunk, with Fritz's assistance\r\nI carefully stopped up every hole in the tree with wet clay, that the\r\nbees might not issue forth next morning before we could begin\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nVery early were we up and at work. I first took a hollow cane, and\r\ninserted one end through the clay into the tree; down this tube with\r\npipe and tobacco I smoked most furiously.\r\n\r\nThe humming and buzzing that went on within was tremendous; the bees\r\nevidently could not understand what was going to happen. I finished my\r\nfirst pipeful, and putting my thumb over the end of the cane, I gave\r\nthe pipe to Fritz to refill. He did so and I again smoked. The buzzing\r\nwas now becoming less noisy, and was subsiding into a mere murmur. By\r\nthe time I had finished this second pipe all was still; the bees were\r\nstupefied.\r\n\r\n`Now then, Fritz,' said I, `quick with a hammer and chisel, and stand\r\nhere beside me.'\r\n\r\nHe was up in a moment, and, together, we cut a small door by the side\r\nof the hole; this door however, we did not take out, but we left it\r\nattached by one corner that it might be removed at a moment's notice,\r\nthen giving the bees a final dose of tobacco smoke, we opened it.\r\n\r\nCarefully but rapidly we removed the insects, as they clung in\r\nclusters to the sides of the tree, and placed them in the hive\r\nprepared for their reception. As rapidly I then took every atom of wax\r\nand honey from their storehouse, and put it in a cask I had made ready\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bees were now safely removed from the trunk, but I could not tell\r\nwhether, when they revived from their temporary stupor, they might not\r\nrefuse to occupy the house with which I had presented them, and insist\r\non returning to their old quarters. To prevent the possibility of this\r\noccurrence I took a quantity of tobacco, and, placing it upon a board\r\nnailed horizontally within the trunk, I lighted it and allowed it to\r\nburn slowly that the fumes might fill the cavity.\r\n\r\nIt was well I did so, for, as the bees returned to consciousness, they\r\nleft their pretty hive and buzzed away to the trunk of the tree. They\r\nseemed astonished at finding this uninhabitable, and an immense deal of\r\nnoisy humming ensued. Round and round they flew, backwards and forwards\r\nbetween the gourd and tree, now settling here and now there, until, at\r\nlength, after due consideration, they took possession of the hive and\r\nabandoned their former habitation to us the invaders of their\r\nterritory. By the evening they were quite quiet, and we ventured to\r\nopen the cask in which we had stored our plunder.\r\n\r\nWe first separated the honey from the honeycomb and poured it off into\r\njars and pots; the rest we then took and threw into a vessel of water\r\nplaced over a slow fire. It soon boiled and the entire mass became\r\nfluid. This we placed in a clean canvas bag, and subjected to a heavy\r\npressure. The honey was thus soon forced out, and we stored it in a\r\ncask, and, though not perhaps quite equal to the former batch in\r\nquality, it was yet capital. The wax that remained in the bag I also\r\ncarefully stored, for I knew it would be of great use to me in the\r\nmanufacture of candles. Then after a hard day's work we turned in.\r\n\r\nThe internal architecture of the tree had now to be attended to, and\r\nearly the following morning we prepared for the labourious task. A door\r\nhad first to be made, so at the base of the trunk we cut away the bark\r\nand formed an opening just the size of the door we had brought from the\r\ncaptain's cabin, and which, hinges and all, was ready to be hung.\r\n\r\nThe clearing of the rotten wood from the centre of the trunk occupied\r\nus some time, but at length we had the satisfaction of seeing it\r\nentirely accomplished, and, as we stood below, we could look up the\r\ntrunk, which was like a great smooth funnel, and see the sky above.\r\n\r\nIt was now ready for the staircase, and first we erected in the centre\r\na stout sapling to form an axis round which to build the spiral stairs;\r\nin this we cut notches to receive the steps, and corresponding notches\r\nin the tree itself to support the outer ends. The steps themselves we\r\nformed carefully and neatly of planks from the wreck, and clenched them\r\nfirmly in their places with stout nails.\r\n\r\nUpwards and upwards we built, cutting windows in the trunk as we\r\nrequired, to admit light and air, until we were flush with the top of\r\nthe centre pole. On this pole we erected another to reach the top of\r\nthe tree, and securing it firmly, built in the same way round it until\r\nwe at length reached the level of the floor of the nest above.\r\n\r\nTo make the ascent of the stairs perfectly easy we ran a hand-rail on\r\neither side, one round the centre pillar, and the other following the\r\ncurve of the trunk.\r\n\r\nThis task occupied us a whole month, and by the end of that period, so\r\naccustomed had we become to having a definite piece of work before us\r\nthat we began to consider what other great alteration we should\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\nWe were, however, of course not neglecting the details of our colonial\r\nestablishment. There were all the animals to be attended to; the goats\r\nand sheep had both presented us with additions to our flock, and these\r\nfrisky youngsters had to be seen after; to prevent them straying to any\r\ngreat distance, for we had no wish to lose them, we tied round their\r\nnecks little bells, which we had found on board the wreck, and which\r\nwould assist us to track them.\r\n\r\nJuno, too, had a fine litter of puppies, but, in spite of the\r\nentreaties of the children, I could not consent to keep more than two,\r\nand the rest disappeared in that mysterious way in which puppies and\r\nkittens are wont to leave the earth. To console the mother, as he said,\r\nbut also, I suspect, to save himself considerable trouble, Jack placed\r\nhis little jackal beside the remaining puppies, and, to his joy, found\r\nit readily adopted.\r\n\r\nThe other pets were also flourishing, and were being usefully trained.\r\nThe buffalo, after giving us much trouble, had now become perfectly\r\ndomesticated, and was a very useful beast of burden, besides being a\r\ncapital steed for the boys. They guided him by a bar thrust through the\r\nhole in his nose, which was now perfectly healed, and this served the\r\npurpose just as a bit in the mouth of a horse. I began his education by\r\nsecuring round him a broad girth of buffalo-hide and fastening to it\r\nvarious articles, to accustom him to carrying a burden. By degrees he\r\npermitted this to be done without making the slightest resistance, and\r\nsoon carried the panniers, before borne by the ass, readily and\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\nI then made Master Knips sit upon his back and hold the reins I had\r\nprepared for him, that the animal might become accustomed to the\r\nfeeling of a rider, and finally allowed Fritz himself to mount.\r\n\r\nThe education of the eagle was not neglected. Fritz every day shot\r\nsmall birds for his food, and these he placed sometimes between the\r\nwide-spreading horns of the buffalo or goat, and sometimes upon the\r\nback of the great bustard, that he might become accustomed to pounce\r\nupon living prey.\r\n\r\nThese lessons had their due effect, and the bird, having been taught to\r\nobey the voice and whistle of his master, was soon allowed to bring\r\ndown small birds upon the wing, when he stooped and struck his quarry\r\nin most sportsmanlike manner. We kept him well away from the\r\npoultry-yard lest his natural instincts should show themselves, and he\r\nshould put an untimely end to some of our feathered pets.\r\n\r\nNeither was Master Knips allowed to remain idle, for Ernest, now that\r\nhe was in his possession, wished to train him to be of some use. With\r\nJack's help he made a little basket of rushes, which he so arranged\r\nwith straps that it might be easily fitted on to the monkey's back.\r\nThus equipped he was taught to mount cocoanut palms and other lofty\r\ntrees, and to bring down their fruit in the hamper.\r\n\r\nJack was not so successful in his educational attempts. Fangs, as he\r\nhad christened his jackal, used his fangs indeed, but only on his own\r\naccount; nothing could persuade him that the animals he caught were not\r\nat once to be devoured, consequently poor Jack was never able to save\r\nfrom his jaws anything but the tattered skin of his prey. Not\r\ndisheartened, however, he determined that Fangs could be trained, and\r\nthat he would train him.\r\n\r\nThese, and suchlike employments, afforded us the rest and recreation we\r\nrequired while engaged in the labourious task of staircase building.\r\n\r\nAmong my minor occupations, I applied myself to the improvement of our\r\ncandles. Though the former batch had greatly delighted us at first, yet\r\nwe were soon obliged to acknowledge that the light they gave was\r\nimperfect, and their appearance was unsightly; my wife, too, begged me\r\nto find some substitute for the threads of our cotton neck-ties*, which\r\nI had previously used as wicks.\r\n\r\n   * Not what we today call neckties, but rather a soft band of\r\n     cloth worn loosely around the neck and used as a sweatband,\r\n     to keep sweat and dirt from lodging in the neckband of the\r\n     shirt. A collar at this time was a separate piece of cloth,\r\n     buttoned on and worn only for at least semi-formal\r\n     occasions.\r\n\r\nTo give the proper shape and smoothness to the candles, I determined to\r\nuse the bamboo moulds I had prepared. My first idea was to pour the wax\r\nin at the end of the mould, and then when the candles were cooled to\r\nslip them out; but I was soon convinced that this plan would not\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined to divide the moulds lengthways, and then,\r\nhaving greased them well, we might pour the melted wax into the two\r\nhalves bound tightly together, and so be able to take out the candles\r\nwhen cool without injuring them.\r\n\r\nThe wicks were my next difficulty, and as my wife positively refused to\r\nallow us to devote our ties and handkerchiefs for the purpose, I took a\r\npiece of inflammable wood from a tree, a native of the Antilles, which\r\nI thought would serve our purpose; this I cut into long slips, and\r\nfixed in the centres of the moulds. My wife, too, prepared some wicks\r\nfrom the fibres of the karata tree, which she declared would beat mine\r\ncompletely out of the field.\r\n\r\nWe put them to the proof. On a large fire we placed a pot, in which we\r\nprepared our wax mixture--half bees' wax and half wax from the\r\ncandleberries. The moulds carefully prepared--half with karata fibre,\r\nand half with wooden splint wicks--stood on their ends in a tub of cold\r\nwater, ready to receive the wax.\r\n\r\nThey were filled; the wax cooled; the candles taken out and subjected\r\nto the criticism of all hands. When night drew on, they were formally\r\ntested. The decision was unanimous: neither gave such a good light as\r\nthose with the cotton wicks; but even my wife declared that the light\r\nfrom mine was far preferable to that emitted by hers, for the former,\r\nthough rather flaring, burned brilliantly, while the latter gave out\r\nsuch a feeble and flickering flame that it was almost useless.\r\n\r\nI then turned shoemaker, for I had promised myself a pair of\r\nwaterproof boots, and now determined to make them.\r\n\r\nTaking a pair of socks, I filled them with sand, and then coated them\r\nover with a thin layer of clay to form a convenient mould; this was\r\nsoon hardened in the sun, and was ready for use. Layer after layer of\r\ncaoutchouc I brushed over it, allowing each layer to dry before the\r\nnext was put on, until at length I considered that the shoes were of\r\nsufficient thickness. I dried them, broke out the clay, secured with\r\nnails a strip of buffalo-hide to the soles, brushed that over with\r\ncaoutchouc, and I had a pair of comfortable, durable,\r\nrespectable-looking waterproof boots.\r\n\r\nI was delighted; orders poured in from all sides, and soon everyone in\r\nthe family was likewise provided for.\r\n\r\nOne objection to Falconhurst was the absence of any spring close by, so\r\nthat the boys were obliged to bring water daily from the stream; and\r\nthis involving no little trouble, it was proposed that we should carry\r\nthe water by pipes from the stream to our present residence. A dam had\r\nto be thrown across the river some way up stream, that the water might\r\nbe raised to a sufficient height to run to Falconhurst. From the\r\nreservoir thus made we led the water down by pipes into the turtle's\r\nshell, which we placed near our dwelling, and from which the\r\nsuperfluous water flowed off through the hole made in it by Fritz's\r\nharpoon.\r\n\r\nThis was an immense convenience, and we formally inaugurated the\r\ntrough by washing therein a whole sack of potatoes. Thus day after day\r\nbrought its own work, and day after day saw that work completed. We had\r\nno time to be idle, or to lament our separation from our fellow\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we were completing our spiral staircase, and giving it\r\nsuch finish as we were capable of, we were suddenly alarmed by hearing\r\na most terrific noise, the roaring or bellowing of a wild beast; so\r\nstrange a sound was it, that I could not imagine by what animal it was\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\nJack thought it perhaps a lion, Fritz hazarded a gorilla, while Ernest\r\ngave it as his opinion, and I thought it possible that he was right,\r\nthat it was a hyaena.\r\n\r\n`Whatever it is,' said I, `we must prepare to receive it; up with you\r\nall to the nest while I secure the door.'\r\n\r\nThen arming the dogs with their collars, I sent them out to protect the\r\nanimals below, closed the door, and joined my family.\r\n\r\nEvery gun was loaded, every eye was upon the watch. The sound drew\r\nnearer, and then all was still; nothing was to be seen. I determined to\r\ndescend and reconnoitre, and Fritz and I carefully crept down; with our\r\nguns at full cock we glided amongst the trees; noiselessly and quickly\r\nwe pushed on further and further; suddenly, close by, we heard the\r\nterrific sound again. Fritz raised his gun, but almost as quickly again\r\ndropped it, and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking those dulcet tones--hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw,\r\nresounded through the forest, and our ass braying his approach right\r\nmerrily appeared in sight. To our surprise, however, our friend was not\r\nalone: behind him trotted another animal, an ass no doubt, but slim and\r\ngraceful as a horse. We watched their movements anxiously.\r\n\r\n`Fritz,' I whispered, `that is an onager. Creep back to Falconhurst and\r\nbring me a piece of cord--quietly now!'\r\n\r\nWhile he was gone, I cut a bamboo and split it halfway down to form a\r\npair of pincers, which I knew would be of use to me should I get near\r\nthe animal. Fritz soon returned with the cord, and I was glad to\r\nobserve also brought some oats and salt. We made one end of the cord\r\nfast to a tree, and at the other end made a running noose. Silently we\r\nwatched the animals as they approached, quietly browsing; Fritz then\r\nrose, holding in one hand the noose, and in the other some oats and\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\nThe ass, seeing his favourite food thus held out, advanced to take it;\r\nFritz allowed him to do so, and he was soon munching contentedly. The\r\nstranger, on seeing Fritz, started back; but finding her companion show\r\nno signs of alarm, was reassured, and soon approached sniffing, and was\r\nabout to take some of the tempting food.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the noose left Fritz's adroit hand and fell round her\r\nneck; with a single bound she sprang backwards the full length of the\r\ncord, the noose drew tight, and she fell to the earth half strangled. I\r\nat once ran up, loosened the rope and replaced it by a halter; and\r\nplacing the pincers upon her nose, secured her by two cords fastened\r\nbetween two trees, and then left her to recover herself.\r\n\r\nEveryone hastened up to examine the beautiful animal as she rose from\r\nthe ground and cast fiery glances around. She lashed out with her heels\r\non every side; and, giving vent to angry snorts, struggled violently to\r\nget free. All her endeavours were vain: the cords were stout, and after\r\na while she quieted down and stood exhausted and quivering.\r\n\r\nI then approached: she suffered me to lead her to the roots of our\r\ntree, which for the present formed our stables, and there I tied her up\r\nclose to the donkey, who was likewise prevented from playing truant.\r\n\r\nNext morning I found the onager after her night's rest as wild as\r\never, and as I looked at the handsome creature I almost despaired of\r\never taming her proud spirit. Every expedient was tried, and at length,\r\nwhen the animal was subdued by hunger, I thought I might venture to\r\nmount her; and having given her the strongest curb and shackled her\r\nfeet, I attempted to do so. She was as unruly as ever, and as a last\r\nexpedient I resolved to adopt a plan which, though cruel, was I knew\r\nattended with wonderful success by the American Indians, by whom it is\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nWatching a favourable opportunity, I sprang upon the onager's back, and\r\nseizing her long ear in my teeth, in spite of her kicking and plunging,\r\nbit it through. The result was marvellous, the animal ceased plunging,\r\nand, quivering violently, stood stock-still.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment we were her masters, the children mounted her one\r\nafter the other, and she carried them obediently and quietly. Proud,\r\nindeed, did I feel as I watched this animal, which naturalists and\r\ntravellers have declared to be beyond the power of man to tame, guided\r\nhither and thither by my youngest son.\r\n\r\nAdditions to our poultry yard reminded me of the necessity of\r\nproviding some substantial shelter for our animals before the rainy\r\nseason came on; three broods of chickens had been successfully hatched,\r\nand the little creatures, forty in all, were my wife's pride and\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nWe began by making a roof over the vaulted roots of our tree, forming\r\nthe framework of bamboo canes which we laid close together and bound\r\ntightly down; others we fixed below as supports. The interstices were\r\nfilled up with clay and moss; and coating the whole over with a mixture\r\nof tar and lime-water, we obtained a firm balcony, and a capital roof\r\nimpervious to the severest fall of rain. I ran a light rail round the\r\nbalcony to give it a more ornamental appearance, and below divided the\r\nbuilding into several compartments. Stables, poultry yard, hay and\r\nprovision lofts, dairy, kitchen, larder and dining-hall were united\r\nunder one roof.\r\n\r\nOur winter-quarters were now completed, and we had but to store them\r\nwith food. Day after day we worked, bringing in provisions of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAs we were one evening returning from gathering potatoes, it struck me\r\nthat we should take in a store of acorns; and sending the two younger\r\nboys home with their mother and the cart, I took a large canvas bag,\r\nand with Fritz and Ernest, the former mounted on his onager, and the\r\nlatter carrying his little favourite, Knips, made a detour towards the\r\nAcorn Wood.\r\n\r\nWe reached the spot, tied Lightfoot to a neighbouring tree, and began\r\nrapidly to fill the sack. As we were thus engaged, Knips sprang\r\nsuddenly into a bush close by, from which, a moment afterwards, issued\r\nsuch strange cries that Ernest followed to see what could be the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n`Come!' he shouted, `Come and help me! I've got a couple of birds and\r\ntheir eggs. Quick! Ruffed grouse!'\r\n\r\nWe hurried to the spot. There was Ernest with a fluttering, screaming\r\nbird in either hand; while, with his foot, he was endeavouring to\r\nprevent his greedy little monkey from seizing the eggs. We quickly tied\r\nthe legs of the birds, and removing the eggs from the nest, placed them\r\nin Ernest's hat; while he gathered some of the long, broad grass, with\r\nwhich the nest was woven, and which grew luxuriantly around, for Franz\r\nto play at sword-drill with.\r\n\r\nWe then loaded the onager with the acorns and moved homewards. The eggs\r\nI covered carefully with dry moss, that they might be kept warm, and as\r\nsoon as possible I handed them over to my wife who managed the mother\r\nso cleverly that she induced her to return to the eggs, and in a few\r\ndays, to our great delight, we had fifteen beautiful little Canadian\r\nchicks.\r\n\r\nFranz was greatly pleased with the 'swords' his brother brought him;\r\nbut having no small companion on whom to exercise his valour, he amused\r\nhimself for a short time in hewing down imaginary foes, and then cut\r\nthe reeds in slips, and plaited them to form a whip for Lightfoot.\r\n\r\nThe leaves seemed so pliable and strong, that I examined them to see to\r\nwhat further use they might be put. Their tissue was composed of long\r\nsilky fibres. A sudden thought struck me--this must be New Zealand\r\nflax. I could not rest till I had announced this invaluable discovery\r\nto my wife. She was no less delighted than I was.\r\n\r\n`Bring me the leaves!' she exclaimed. `Oh, what a delightful\r\ndiscovery! No one shall now be clothed in rags; just make me a\r\nspindle, and you shall soon have shirts and stockings and trousers, all\r\ngood homespun! Quick, Fritz, and bring your mother more leaves!'\r\n\r\nWe could not help smiling at her eager zeal; but Fritz and Ernest\r\nsprang on their steeds, and soon the onager and buffalo were galloping\r\nhome again, each laden with a great bundle of flax. The boys dismounted\r\nand deposited their offering at their mother's feet.\r\n\r\n`Capital!' she exclaimed. `I shall now show you that I am not at all\r\nbehindhand in ingenuity. This must be retted, carded, spun and woven,\r\nand then with scissors, needle and thread I will make you any article\r\nof clothing you choose.'\r\n\r\nWe decided that Flamingo Marsh would be the best spot for the\r\noperation of steeping or `retting' the flax, and next morning we set\r\nout thither; the cart drawn by the ass, and laden with the bundles,\r\nbetween which sat Franz and Knips, while the rest of us followed with\r\nspades and hatchets.\r\n\r\nI described to my boys as we went along the process of retting, and\r\nexplained to them how steeping the flax leaves destroys the useless\r\nmembrane, while the strong fibres remain.\r\n\r\nAs we were employed in making beds for the flax and placing it in\r\nthem, we observed several nests of the flamingo. These are most\r\ncuriously and skilfully made of glutinous clay, so strong that they can\r\nneither be overturned nor washed away. They are formed in the shape of\r\nblunted cones, and placed point downwards; at the upper and broader end\r\nis built a little platform to contain the eggs, on which the female\r\nbird sits, with her long legs in the water on either side, until the\r\nlittle birds are hatched and can take to the water.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight we left the flax to steep, and then taking it out and\r\ndrying it thoroughly in the sun, stored it for future use at\r\nFalconhurst.\r\n\r\nDaily did we load our cart with provisions to be brought to our\r\nwinter-quarters: manioc, potatoes, cocoanuts, sweet acorns,\r\nsugar-canes, were all collected and stored in abundance--for grumbling\r\nthunder, lowering skies, and sharp showers warned us that we had no\r\ntime to lose. Our corn was sowed, our animals housed, our provisions\r\nstored, when down came the rain.\r\n\r\nTo continue in our nest we found impossible, and we were obliged to\r\nretreat to the trunk, where we carried such of our domestic furniture\r\nas might have been injured by the damp. Our dwelling was indeed\r\ncrowded: the animals and provisions below, and our beds and household\r\ngoods around us, hemmed us in on every side; by degrees, by dint of\r\npatience and better packing, we obtained sufficient room to work and\r\nlie down in; by degrees, too, we became accustomed to the continual\r\nnoise of the animals and the smell of the stables.\r\n\r\nThe smoke from the fire, which we were occasionally obliged to light,\r\nwas not agreeable; but in time even that seemed to become more\r\nbearable.\r\n\r\nTo make more space, we turned such animals as we had captured, and who\r\ntherefore might be imagined to know how to shift for themselves,\r\noutside during the daytime, bringing them under the arched roots only\r\nat night. To perform this duty Fritz and I used to sally forth every\r\nevening, and as regularly every evening did we return soaked to the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nTo obviate this, my wife, who feared these continual wettings might\r\ninjure our health, contrived waterproofs: she brushed on several layers\r\nof caoutchouc over stout shirts, to which she attached hoods; she then\r\nfixed to these duck trousers, and thus prepared for each of us a\r\ncomplete waterproof suit, clad in which we might brave the severest\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our endeavours to keep ourselves busy, the time dragged\r\nheavily. Our mornings were occupied in tending the animals; the boys\r\namused themselves with their pets, and assisted me in the manufacture\r\nof carding-combs and a spindle for their mother. The combs I made with\r\nnails, which I placed head downwards on a sheet of tin about an inch\r\nwide; holding the nails in their proper positions I poured solder round\r\ntheir heads to fix them to the tin, which I then folded down on either\r\nside of them to keep them perfectly firm.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when our room was illuminated with wax candles, I\r\nwrote a journal of all the events which had occurred since our arrival\r\nin this foreign land; and, while my wife was busy with her needle and\r\nErnest making sketches of birds, beasts and flowers with which he had\r\nmet during the past months, Fritz and Jack taught little Franz to read.\r\n\r\nWeek after week rolled by. Week after week saw us still close\r\nprisoners. Incessant rain battered down above us, constant gloom hung\r\nover the desolate scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nThe winds at length were lulled, the sun shot his brilliant rays\r\nthrough the riven clouds, the rain ceased to fall--spring had come. No\r\nprisoners set at liberty could have felt more joy than we did as we\r\nstepped forth from our winter abode, refreshed our eyes with the\r\npleasant verdure around us, and our ears with the merry songs of a\r\nthousand happy birds, and drank in the pure balmy air of spring.\r\n\r\nOur plantations were thriving vigorously. The seed we had sown was\r\nshooting through the moist earth. All nature was refreshed.\r\n\r\nOur nest was our first care: filled with leaves and broken and torn by\r\nthe wind, it looked indeed dilapidated. We worked hard, and in a few\r\ndays it was again habitable. My wife begged that I would now start her\r\nwith the flax, and as early as possible I built a drying-oven, and then\r\nprepared it for her use; I also, after some trouble, manufactured a\r\nbeetle-reel and spinning-wheel, and she and Franz were soon hard at\r\nwork, the little boy reeling off the thread his mother spun.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to visit Tentholm, for I feared that much of our\r\nprecious stores might have suffered. Fritz and I made an excursion\r\nthither. The damage done to Falconhurst was as nothing compared to the\r\nscene that awaited us. The tent was blown to the ground, the canvas\r\ntorn to rags, the provisions soaked, and two casks of powder utterly\r\ndestroyed. We immediately spread such things as we hoped yet to\r\npreserve in the sun to dry.\r\n\r\nThe pinnace was safe, but our faithful tub-boat was dashed in pieces,\r\nand the irreparable damage we had sustained made me resolve to contrive\r\nsome safer and more stable winter-quarters before the arrival of the\r\nnext rainy season. Fritz proposed that we should hollow out a cave in\r\nthe rock, and though the difficulties such an undertaking would present\r\nappeared almost insurmountable, I yet determined to make the attempt;\r\nwe might not, I thought, hew out a cavern of sufficient size to serve\r\nas a room, but we might at least make a cellar for the more valuable\r\nand perishable of our stores.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards we left Falconhurst with the cart laden with a\r\ncargo of spades, hammers, chisels, pickaxes and crowbars, and began our\r\nundertaking. On the smooth face of the perpendicular rock I drew out in\r\nchalk the size of the proposed entrance, and then, with minds bent on\r\nsuccess, we battered away.\r\n\r\nSix days of hard and incessant toil made but little impression; I do\r\nnot think that the hole would have been a satisfactory shelter for even\r\nMaster Knips; but we still did not despair, and were presently rewarded\r\nby coming to softer and more yielding substance; our work progressed,\r\nand our minds were relieved.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day, as our persevering blows were falling heavily, Jack,\r\nwho was working diligently with a hammer and crowbar, shouted:\r\n\r\n`Gone, father! Fritz, my bar has gone through the mountain!'\r\n\r\n`Run round and get it,' laughed Fritz, `perhaps it has dropped into\r\nEurope--you must not lose a good crowbar.'\r\n\r\n`But, really, it is through; it went right through the rock; I heard it\r\ncrash down inside. Oh, do come and see!' he shouted excitedly.\r\n\r\nWe sprang to his side, and I thrust the handle of my hammer into the\r\nhole he spoke of; it met with no opposition, I could turn it in any\r\ndirection I chose. Fritz handed me a long pole; I tried the depth with\r\nthat. Nothing could I feel. A thin wall, then, was all that intervened\r\nbetween us and a great cavern.\r\n\r\nWith a shout of joy, the boys battered vigorously at the rock; piece by\r\npiece fell, and soon the hole was large enough for us to enter. I\r\nstepped near the aperture, and was about to make a further examination,\r\nwhen a sudden rush of poisonous air turned me giddy, and shouting to my\r\nsons to stand off, I leaned against the rock.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself I explained to them the danger of approaching any\r\ncavern or other place where the air has for a long time been stagnant.\r\n`Unless air is incessantly renewed it becomes vitiated,' I said, `and\r\nfatal to those who breathe it. The safest way of restoring it to its\r\noriginal state is to subject it to the action of fire; a few handfuls\r\nof blazing hay thrown into this hole may, if the place be small,\r\nsufficiently purify the air within to allow us to enter without\r\ndanger.' We tried the experiment. The flame was extinguished the\r\ninstant it entered. Though bundles of blazing grass were thrown in, no\r\ndifference was made.*\r\n\r\n   * What actually happens is that the oxygen supply becomes\r\n     low. If there is sufficient oxygen to maintain a flame, the\r\n     action of the flame increases air circulation, which then\r\n     brings in more oxygen. The flame goes out if the oxygen\r\n     supply is insufficient for its supply; in this case, it\r\n     takes the fireworks to create adequate circulation. The next\r\n     torch is able to blaze not because the air is purified, but\r\n     because the oxygen is now sufficient to feed the fire.\r\n\r\nI saw that we must apply some more efficacious remedy, and sent the\r\nboys for a chest of signal-rockets we had brought from the wreck. We\r\nlet fly some dozens of these fiery serpents, which went whizzing in and\r\ndisappeared at apparently a vast distance from us. Some flew like\r\nradiant meteors round, lighted up the mighty circumference and\r\ndisplayed, as by a magician's wand, a sparkling glittering roof. They\r\nlooked like avenging dragons driving a foul malignant fiend out of a\r\nbeauteous palace.\r\n\r\nWe waited for a little while after these experiments, and I then again\r\nthrew in lighted hay. It burned clearly; the air was purified.\r\n\r\nFritz and I enlarged the opening, while Jack, springing on his\r\nbuffalo, thundered away to Falconhurst to bear the great and\r\nastonishing news to his mother.\r\n\r\nGreat must have been the effect of Jack's eloquence on those at home,\r\nfor the timbers of the bridge were soon again resounding under the\r\nswift but heavy tramp of his steed; and he was quickly followed by the\r\nrest of our party in the cart.\r\n\r\nAll were in the highest state of excitement. Jack had stowed in the\r\ncart all the candles he could find, and we now, lighting these,\r\nshouldered our arms and entered. I led the way, sounding the ground as\r\nI advanced with a long pole, that we might not fall unexpectedly into\r\nany great hole or chasm.\r\n\r\nSilently we marched--my wife, the boys, and even the dogs seeming\r\noverawed with the grandeur and beauty of the scene We were in a grotto\r\nof diamonds--a vast cave of glittering crystal; the candles reflected\r\non the walls a golden light, bright as the stars of Heaven, while great\r\ncrystal pillars rose from the floor like mighty trees, mingling their\r\nbranches high above us and drooping in hundreds of stalactites, which\r\nsparkled and glittered with all the colours of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe floor of this magnificent palace was formed of hard, dry sand, so\r\ndry that I saw at once that we might safely take up our abode therein,\r\nwithout the slightest fear of danger from damp.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the brilliant crystals round about us, I\r\nsuspected their nature. I tasted a piece. This was a cavern of\r\nrock-salt. There was no doubt about it--here was an unlimited supply of\r\nthe best and purest salt!\r\n\r\nBut one thing detracted from my entire satisfaction and delight--large\r\ncrystals lay scattered here and there, which, detached from the roof,\r\nhad fallen to the ground; this, if apt to recur, would keep us in\r\nconstant peril. I examined some of the masses and discovered that they\r\nhad been all recently separated, and therefore concluded that the\r\nconcussion of the air, occasioned by the rockets, had caused their\r\nfall. To satisfy ourselves, however, that there were no more pieces\r\ntottering above us, we discharged our guns from the entrance, and\r\nwatched the effect.\r\n\r\nNothing more fell--our magnificent abode was safe. We returned to\r\nFalconhurst with minds full of wonder at our new discovery, and plans\r\nfor turning it to the best possible advantage.\r\n\r\nNothing was now talked of but the new house, how it should be\r\narranged, how it should be fitted up. The safety and comfort of\r\nFalconhurst, which had at first seemed so great, now dwindled away in\r\nour opinion to nothing; it should be kept up we decided merely as a\r\nsummer residence, while our cave should be formed into a winter house\r\nand impregnable castle.\r\n\r\nOur attention was now fully occupied with this new house. Light and air\r\nwere to be admitted, so we hewed a row of windows in the rock, where we\r\nfitted the window-cases we had brought from the officers' cabins.\r\n\r\nWe brought the door, too, from Falconhurst, and fitted it in the\r\naperture we had made. The opening in the trunk of the tree I\r\ndetermined to conceal with bark, as less likely to attract the notice\r\nof wild beasts or savages should they approach during our absence.\r\n\r\nThe cave itself we divided into four parts: in front, a large\r\ncompartment into which the door opened, subdivided into our sitting,\r\neating and sleeping apartments; the right-hand division, containing our\r\nkitchen and workshop, and the left our stables; behind all this, in the\r\ndark recess of the cave, was our storehouse and powder-magazine.\r\n\r\nHaving already undergone one rainy reason, we knew well its\r\ndiscomforts, and thought of many useful arrangements in the laying-out\r\nof our dwelling. We did not intend to be again smoke-dried; we,\r\ntherefore, contrived a properly built fireplace and chimney; our stable\r\narrangements, too, were better, and plenty of space was left in our\r\nworkshop that we should not be hampered in even the most extensive\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nOur frequent residence at Tentholm revealed to us several important\r\nadvantages which we had not foreseen. Numbers of splendid turtles often\r\ncame ashore to deposit their eggs in the sand, and their delicious\r\nflesh afforded us many a sumptuous meal. When more than one of these\r\ncreatures appeared at a time, we used to cut off their retreat to the\r\nsea, and, turning them on their backs, fasten them to a stake, driven\r\nin close by the water's edge, by a cord passed through a hole in their\r\nshell. We thus had fresh turtle continually within our reach; for the\r\nanimals throve well thus secured, and appeared in as good condition,\r\nafter having been kept thus for several weeks, as others when freshly\r\ncaught. Lobsters, crabs and mussels also abounded on the shore. But\r\nthis was not all; an additional surprise awaited us.\r\n\r\nAs we were one morning approaching Tentholm, we were attracted by a\r\nmost curious phenomenon. The waters out to sea appeared agitated by\r\nsome unseen movement, and as they heaved and boiled, their surface,\r\nstruck by the beams of the morning sun, seemed illuminated by flashes\r\nof fire.\r\n\r\nOver the water where this disturbance was taking place hovered\r\nhundreds of birds, screaming loudly, which ever and anon would dart\r\ndownwards, some plunging beneath the water, some skimming the surface.\r\nThen again they would rise and resume their harsh cries. The shining,\r\nsparkling mass then rolled onwards, and approached in a direct line our\r\nbay, followed by the feathered flock above. We hurried down to the\r\nshore to further examine this strange sight.\r\n\r\nI was convinced as we approached that it was a shoal or bank of\r\nherrings.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did I give utterance to my conjecture, than I was assailed by\r\na host of questions concerning this herring-bank, what it was, and what\r\noccasioned it.\r\n\r\n`A herring-bank,' I said, `is composed of an immense number of\r\nherrings swimming together. I can scarcely express to you the huge size\r\nof this living bank, which extends over a great area many fathoms deep.\r\nIt is followed by numbers of great ravenous fish, who devour quantities\r\nof the herrings, while above hover birds, as you have just seen, ready\r\nto pounce down on stragglers near the top. To escape these enemies, the\r\nshoal makes for the nearest shore, and seeks safety in those shallows\r\nwhere the large fish cannot follow. But here it meets with a third\r\ngreat enemy.\r\n\r\n`It may escape from the fish, and elude the vigilance of sharp-sighted\r\nbirds, but from the ingenuity of man it can find no escape. In one year\r\nmillions of these fish are caught, and yet the roes of only a small\r\nnumber would be sufficient to supply as many fish again.'\r\n\r\nSoon our fishery was in operation. Jack and Fritz stood in the water\r\nwith baskets, and baled out the fish, as one bales water with a bucket,\r\nthrowing them to us on the shore. As quickly as possible we cleaned\r\nthem, and placed them in casks with salt, first a layer of salt, and\r\nthen a layer of herrings, and so on, until we had ready many casks of\r\npickled fish.\r\n\r\nAs the barrels were filled, we closed them carefully, and rolled them\r\naway to the cool vaults at the back of our cave. Our good fortune,\r\nhowever, was not to end here. A day after the herring fishery was over,\r\nand the shoal had left our bay, a great number of seals appeared,\r\nattracted by the refuse of the herrings which we had thrown into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThough I feared they would not be suitable for our table, we yet\r\nsecured a score or two for the sake of their skins and fat. The skins\r\nwe drew carefully off for harness and clothing, and the fat we boiled\r\ndown for oil, which we put aside in casks for tanning, soap-making, and\r\nburning in lamps.\r\n\r\nThese occupations interfered for some time with our work at Rock\r\nHouse; but as soon as possible we again returned to our labour with\r\nrenewed vigour. I had noticed that the salt crystals had for their base\r\na species of gypsum, which I knew might be made of great service to us\r\nin our building operations as plaster.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, I broke off some pieces, and, after subjecting them\r\nto great heat, reduced them to powder. The plaster this formed with\r\nwater was smooth and white, and as I had then no particular use to\r\nwhich I might put it, I plastered over some of the herring casks, that\r\nI might be perfectly certain that all air was excluded. The remainder\r\nof the casks I left as they were, for I presently intended to preserve\r\ntheir contents by smoking.\r\n\r\nTo do this, the boys and I built a small hut of reeds and branches, and\r\nthen we strung our herrings on lines across the roof. On the floor we\r\nlit a great fire of brushwood and moss, which threw out a dense smoke,\r\ncurling in volumes round the fish, and they in a few days seemed\r\nperfectly cured.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after the appearance of the herrings we were favoured by\r\na visit from other shoals of fish. Jack espied them first, and called\r\nto us that a lot of young whales were off the coast. We ran down and\r\ndiscovered the bay apparently swarming with great sturgeon, salmon, and\r\ntrout, all making for the mouth of Jackal River, that they might ascend\r\nit and deposit their spawn amongst the stones.\r\n\r\nJack was delighted at his discovery. `Here are proper fish!' he\r\nexclaimed, `none of your paltry fry. How do you preserve these sorts of\r\nfish? Potted, salted or smoked?'\r\n\r\n`Not so fast,' said I, `not so fast; tell me how they are to be\r\ncaught, and I will tell you how they are to be cooked.'\r\n\r\n`Oh! I'll catch them fast enough,' he replied, and darted off to Rock\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still puzzling my brains as to how I should set to work, he\r\nreturned with his fishing apparatus in hand: a bow and arrow, and a\r\nball of twine.\r\n\r\nAt the arrow-head he had fastened a barbed spike, and had secured the\r\narrow to the end of the string. Armed with this weapon, he advanced to\r\nthe river's edge.\r\n\r\nHis arrow flew from the bow, and, to my surprise, struck one of the\r\nlargest fish in the side.\r\n\r\n`Help, father, help!' he cried, as the great fish darted off, carrying\r\narrow and all with it. `Help! Or he will pull me into the water.'\r\n\r\nI ran to his assistance, and together we struggled with the finny\r\nmonster. He pulled tremendously, and lashed the water around him; but\r\nwe held the cord fast, and he had no chance of escape. Weaker and\r\nweaker grew his struggles, and, at length, exhausted by his exertions\r\nand loss of blood, he allowed us to draw him ashore.\r\n\r\nHe was a noble prize, and Fritz and Ernest, who came up just as we\r\ncompleted his capture, were quite envious of Jack's success.\r\n\r\nNot to be behindhand, they eagerly rushed off for weapons themselves.\r\nWe were soon all in the water, Fritz with a harpoon, Ernest with a rod\r\nand line, and I myself, armed like Neptune, with an iron trident, or\r\nmore properly speaking, perhaps, a pitchfork. Soon the shore was strewn\r\nwith a goodly number of the finest fish--monster after monster we drew\r\nto land. At length Fritz, after harpooning a great sturgeon full eight\r\nfeet long, could not get the beast ashore; we all went to his\r\nassistance, but our united efforts were unavailing.\r\n\r\n`The buffalo!' proposed my wife, and off went Jack for Storm. Storm was\r\nharnessed to the harpoon rope, and soon the monstrous fish lay panting\r\non the sand. We at length, when we had captured as many fish as we\r\ncould possibly utilize, set about cleaning and preparing their flesh.\r\nSome we salted, some we dried like the herrings, some we treated like\r\nthe tunny of the Mediterranean--we prepared them in oil.\r\n\r\nOf the roe of the sturgeon I decided to form caviare, the great\r\nRussian dish. I removed from it all the membranes by which it is\r\nsurrounded, washed it in vinegar, salted it, pressed out all the\r\nmoisture caused by the water-absorbing properties of the salt, packed\r\nit in small barrels and stowed it away in our storehouse.\r\n\r\nI knew that of the sturgeon's bladder the best isinglass is made, so\r\ncarefully collecting the air-bladders from all those we had killed, I\r\nwashed them and hung them up to stiffen. The outer coat or membrane I\r\nthen peeled off, cutting the remainder into strips, technically called\r\nstaples.\r\n\r\nThese staples I place in an iron pot over the fire, and when they had\r\nbeen reduced to a proper consistency I strained off the glue through a\r\nclean cloth, and spread it out on a slab of stone in thin layers,\r\nletting them remain until they were dry. The substance I thus obtained\r\nwas beautifully transparent, and promised to serve as an excellent\r\nsubstitute for glass in our window-frames.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in this beautiful climate little or no attention was\r\nnecessary to the kitchen garden, the seeds sprang up and flourished\r\nwithout apparently the slightest regard for the time or season of the\r\nyear. Peas, beans, wheat, barley, rye and Indian corn, seemed\r\nconstantly ripe, while cucumbers, melons, and all sorts of other\r\nvegetables grew luxuriantly. The success of our garden at Tentholm\r\nencouraged me to hope that my experiment at Falconhurst had not failed,\r\nand one morning we started to visit the spot.\r\n\r\nAs we passed by the field from which the potatoes had been dug, we\r\nfound it covered with barley, wheat, rye and peas in profusion. I\r\nturned to my wife in amazement. `Where has this fine crop sprung from?'\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n`From the earth,' she replied, laughing, `where Franz and I sowed the\r\nseed I brought from the wreck. The ground was ready tilled by you and\r\nthe boys; all we had to do was to scatter the seed.'\r\n\r\nI was delighted at the sight, and it augured well, I thought, for the\r\nsuccess of my maize plantation. We hurried to the field. The crop had\r\nindeed grown well, and what was more, appeared to be duly appreciated.\r\nA tremendous flock of feathered thieves rose as we approached. Amongst\r\nthem Fritz espied a few ruffed grouse, and, quick as thought, unhooding\r\nhis eagle, he started him off in chase, then sprang on his onager and\r\nfollowed at full gallop. His noble bird marked out the finest grouse,\r\nand, soaring high above it, stooped and bore his prey to the ground.\r\n\r\nFritz was close at hand, and springing through the bushes he saved the\r\nbird from death, hooded the eagle's eyes, and returned triumphantly.\r\nJack had not stood idle, for slipping his pet Fangs, he had started him\r\namong some quails who remained upon the field, and to my surprise the\r\njackal secured some dozen of the birds, bringing them faithfully to his\r\nmaster's feet.\r\n\r\nWe then turned our steps towards Falconhurst, where we were refreshed\r\nby a most delicious drink my wife prepared for us; the stems of the\r\nyoung Indian corn crushed, strained, and mixed with water and the juice\r\nof the sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nWe then made preparations for an excursion the following day, for I\r\nwished to establish a sort of semicivilized farm at some distance from\r\nFalconhurst, where we might place some of our animals which had become\r\ntoo numerous with our limited means to supply them with food. In the\r\nlarge cart, to which we harnessed the buffalo, cow, and ass, we placed\r\na dozen fowls, four young pigs, two couple of sheep, and as many goats,\r\nand a pair of hens and one cock grouse. Fritz led the way on his\r\nonager, and by a new track we forced a passage through the woods and\r\ntall grasses towards Cape Disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe difficult march was at length over, and we emerged from the forest\r\nupon a large plain covered with curious little bushes; the branches of\r\nthese little shrubs and the ground about them were covered with pure\r\nwhite flakes.\r\n\r\n`Snow! Snow!' exclaimed Franz. `Oh, mother, come down from the cart and\r\nplay snowballs. This is jolly; much better than the ugly rain.'\r\n\r\nI was not surprised at the boy's mistake, for indeed the flakes did\r\nlook like snow; but before I could express my opinion, Fritz declared\r\nthat the plant must be a kind of dwarf cotton-tree. We approached\r\nnearer and found he was right--soft fine wool enclosed in pods, and\r\nstill hanging on the bushes or lying on the ground, abounded in every\r\ndirection. We had indeed discovered this valuable plant. My wife was\r\ncharmed; and gathering a great quantity in three capacious bags, we\r\nresumed our journey.\r\n\r\nCrossing the cotton-field, we ascended a pretty wooded hill. The view\r\nfrom the summit was glorious: luxuriant grass at our feet stretching\r\ndown the hillside, dotted here and there with shady trees, among which\r\ngushed down a sparkling brook, while below lay the rich green forest,\r\nwith the sea beyond.\r\n\r\nWhat better situation could we hope to find for our new farm? Pasture,\r\nwater, shade and shelter, all were here.\r\n\r\nWe pitched our tent, built our fireplace, and, leaving my wife to\r\nprepare our repast, Fritz and I selected a spot for the erection of our\r\nshed. We soon found a group of trees so situated that the trunks would\r\nserve as posts for our intended building. Thither we carried all our\r\ntools, and then, as the day was far advanced, enjoyed our supper, and\r\nlay down upon most comfortable beds which my wife had prepared for us\r\nwith the cotton.\r\n\r\nThe group of trees we had selected was exactly suited to our purpose,\r\nfor it formed a regular rectilinear figure, the greatest side of which\r\nfaced the sea. I cut deep mortices in the trunks about ten feet from\r\nthe ground, and again ten feet higher up to form a second storey. In\r\nthese mortices I inserted beams, thus forming a framework for my\r\nbuilding, and then, making a roof of laths, I overlaid it with bark,\r\nwhich I stripped from a neighbouring tree, and fixed with acacia\r\nthorns, and which would effectually shoot off any amount of rain.\r\n\r\nWhile clearing up the scraps of bark and other rubbish for fuel for our\r\nfire, I noticed a peculiar smell, and stooping down I picked up pieces\r\nof the bark, some of which, to my great surprise, I found was that of\r\nthe terebinth tree, and the rest that of the American fir. The goats,\r\ntoo, made an important discovery amongst the same heap, for we found\r\nthem busily routing out pieces of cinnamon, a most delicious and\r\naromatic spice.\r\n\r\n`From the fir,' said I to the boys, `we get turpentine and tar, and\r\nthus it is that the fir tree becomes such a valuable article of\r\ncommerce. So we may look forward to preparing pitch for our yacht with\r\ntar and oil, you know, and cart-grease, too, with tar and fat. I do not\r\nknow that you will equally appreciate the terebinth tree; a gum issues\r\nfrom incisions in the bark which hardens in the sun, and becomes as\r\ntransparent as amber; when burned it gives forth a most delicious\r\nperfume, and when dissolved in spirits of wine, forms a beautiful\r\ntransparent varnish.'\r\n\r\nThe completion of our new farm-house occupied us several days; we wove\r\nstrong lianas and other creepers together to form the walls to the\r\nheight of about six feet; the rest, up to the roof, we formed merely of\r\na latticework of laths to admit both air and light. Within we divided\r\nthe house into three parts; one subdivided into stalls for the animals;\r\na second fitted with perches for the birds, and a third, simply\r\nfurnished with a rough table and benches, to serve as a\r\nsleeping-apartment for ourselves, when we should find it necessary to\r\npay the place a visit. In a short time the dwelling was most\r\ncomfortably arranged, and as we daily filled the feeding-troughs with\r\nthe food the animals best liked, they showed no inclination to desert\r\nthe spot we had chosen for them.\r\n\r\nYet, hard as we had worked, we found that the provisions we had\r\nbrought with us would be exhausted before we could hope to be able to\r\nleave the farm. I therefore dispatched Jack and Fritz for fresh\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence, Ernest and I made a short excursion in the\r\nneighbourhood, that we might know more exactly the character of the\r\ncountry near our farm.\r\n\r\nPassing over a brook which flowed towards the wall of rocks, we\r\nreached a large marsh, and as we walked round it, I noticed with\r\ndelight that it was covered with the rice plant growing wild in the\r\ngreatest profusion. Here and there only were there any ripe plants, and\r\nfrom these rose a number of ruffed grouse, at which both Ernest and I\r\nlet fly. Two fell, and Fangs, who was with us, brought them to our\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, Knips skipped from the back of his steed Juno and\r\nbegan to regale himself on some fruit, at a short distance off; we\r\nfollowed the little animal and found him devouring delicious\r\nstrawberries. Having enjoyed the fruit ourselves, we filled the hamper\r\nKnips always carried, and secured the fruit from his pilfering paws\r\nwith leaves fixed firmly down.\r\n\r\nI then took a sample of the rice seeds to show my wife, and we\r\ncontinued our journey.\r\n\r\nPresently we reached the borders of the pretty lake which we had seen\r\nbeyond the swamp. The nearer aspect of its calm blue waters greatly\r\ncharmed us, and still more so, the sight of numbers of black swans,\r\ndisporting themselves on the glassy surface, in which their stately\r\nforms and graceful movements were reflected as in a mirror. It was\r\ndelightful to watch these splendid birds, old and young swimming\r\ntogether in the peaceful enjoyment of life, seeking their food, and\r\npursuing one another playfully in the water.\r\n\r\nI could not think of breaking in upon their happy beautiful existence\r\nby firing among them, but our dog Juno was by no means so considerate;\r\nfor all at once I heard a plunge, and saw her drag out of the water a\r\nmost peculiar-looking creature, something like a small otter, but not\r\nabove twenty-two inches in length, which she would have torn to pieces,\r\nhad we not hurried up and taken it from her.\r\n\r\nThis curious little animal was of a soft dark brown colour, the fur\r\nbeing of a lighter shade under the belly; its feet were furnished with\r\nlarge claws, and also completely webbed, the head small, with deeply\r\nset eyes and ears, and terminating in a broad flat bill like that of a\r\nduck.\r\n\r\nThis singularity seemed to us so droll that we both laughed heartily,\r\nfeeling at the same time much puzzled to know what sort of animal it\r\ncould possibly be. For want of a better, we gave it the name of the\r\n`Beast with a Bill'*, and Ernest willingly undertook to carry it, that\r\nit might be stuffed and kept as a curiosity.\r\n\r\n   * A platypus. The next time they encounter one, he knows its name.\r\n\r\nAfter this we returned to the farm, thinking our messengers might soon\r\narrive, and sure enough, in about a quarter of an hour, Fritz and Jack\r\nmade their appearance at a brisk trot, and gave a circumstantial\r\naccount of their mission.\r\n\r\n    *****NOTE: To get supplies, about fourteen paragraphs earlier.\r\n    But what else did they do? Something is left out.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to see that they had fulfilled their orders\r\nintelligently, carrying out my intentions in the spirit and not\r\nblindly to the letter.\r\n\r\nNext morning we quitted the farm (which we named Woodlands), after\r\nproviding amply for the wants of the animals, sheep, goats and poultry,\r\nwhich we left there.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, on entering a wood, we found it tenanted by an\r\nenormous number of apes, who instantly assailed us with showers of\r\nfir-cones, uttering hideous and angry cries, and effectually checking\r\nour progress, until we put them to flight by a couple of shots, which\r\nnot a little astonished their weak minds.\r\n\r\nFritz picked up some of their missiles, and, showing them to me, I\r\nrecognized the cone of the stone-pine.\r\n\r\n`By all means gather some of these cones, boys,' said I; `you will find\r\nthe kernel has a pleasant taste, like almonds, and from it we can, by\r\npressing, obtain an excellent oil. Therefore I should like to carry\r\nsome home with us.'\r\n\r\nA hill, which seemed to promise a good view from its summit, next\r\nattracted my notice, and, on climbing it we were more than repaid for\r\nthe exertion by the extensive and beautiful prospect which lay spread\r\nbefore our eyes.\r\n\r\nThe situation altogether was so agreeable, that here also I resolved to\r\nmake a settlement, to be visited occasionally, and, after resting\r\nawhile and talking the matter over we set to work to build a cottage\r\nsuch as we had lately finished at Woodlands.\r\n\r\nOur experience there enabled us to proceed quickly with the work, and\r\nin a few days the rustic abode was completed, and received, by Ernest's\r\nchoice, the grand name of Prospect Hill.\r\n\r\nMy chief object in undertaking this expedition had been to discover\r\nsome tree from whose bark I could hope to make a useful light boat or\r\ncanoe. Hitherto I had met with none at all fit for my purpose, but, not\r\ndespairing of success, I began, when the cottage was built, to examine\r\ncarefully the surrounding woods, and, after considerable trouble, came\r\nupon two magnificent tall straight trees, the bark of which seemed\r\nsomething like that of the birch.\r\n\r\nSelecting one whose trunk was, to a great height, free from branches,\r\nwe attached to one of the lower of these boughs the rope ladder we had\r\nwith us, and, Fritz ascending it, cut the bark through in a circle; I\r\ndid the same at the foot of the tree, and then, from between the\r\ncircles, we took a narrow perpendicular slip of bark entirely out, so\r\nthat we could introduce the proper tools by which gradually to loosen\r\nand raise the main part, so as finally to separate it from the tree\r\nuninjured and entire. This we found possible, because the bark was\r\nmoist and flexible.\r\n\r\nGreat care and exertion were necessary, as the bark became detached, to\r\nsupport it, until the whole was ready to be let gently down upon the\r\ngrass. This seemed a great achievement; but our work was by no means\r\nended, nor could we venture to desist from it, until, while the\r\nmaterial was soft and pliable, we had formed it into the shape we\r\ndesired for the canoe.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I cut a long triangular piece out of each end of\r\nthe roll, and, placing the sloping parts one over the other, I drew the\r\nends into a pointed form and secured them with pegs and glue.\r\n\r\nThis successful proceeding had, however, widened the boat, and made it\r\ntoo flat in the middle, so that it was necessary to put ropes round it,\r\nand tighten them until the proper shape was restored, before we could\r\nallow it to dry in the sun.\r\n\r\nThis being all I could do without a greater variety of tools, I\r\ndetermined to complete my work in a more convenient situation, and\r\nforthwith dispatched Fritz and Jack with orders to bring the sledge\r\n(which now ran on wheels taken from gun-carriages) that the canoe might\r\nbe transported direct to the vicinity of the harbour at Tentholm.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence I fortunately found some wood naturally curved,\r\njust suited for ribs to support and strengthen the sides of the boat.\r\n\r\nWhen the two lads returned with the sledge, it was time to rest for the\r\nnight; but with early dawn we were again busily at work.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was loaded with the new boat, and everything else we could\r\npack into it, and we turned our steps homewards, finding the greatest\r\ndifficulty, however, in getting our vehicle through the woods. We\r\ncrossed the bamboo swamp, where I cut a fine mast for my boat, and came\r\nat length to a small opening or defile in the ridge of rocks, where a\r\nlittle torrent rushed from its source down into the larger stream\r\nbeyond; here we determined to make a halt, in order to erect a great\r\nearth wall across the narrow gorge, which, being thickly planted with\r\nprickly pear, Indian-fig, and every thorny bush we could find, would in\r\ntime form an effectual barrier against the intrusion of wild beasts,\r\nthe cliffs being, to the best of our belief, in every other part\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\nFor our own convenience we retained a small winding path through this\r\nbarrier, concealing and defending it with piles of branches and thorns,\r\nand also we contrived a light drawbridge over the stream, so that we\r\nrendered the pass altogether a very strong positron, should we ever\r\nhave to act on the defensive.\r\n\r\nThis work occupied two days, and continuing on our way, we were glad to\r\nrest at Falconhurst before arriving (quite tired and worn out) at\r\nTentholm.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to recruit our strength after this long and\r\nfatiguing expedition, and then we vigorously resumed the task of\r\nfinishing the canoe. The arrangements, I flattered myself, were\r\ncarried out in a manner quite worthy of a shipbuilder; a mast, sails\r\nand paddles were fitted, but my final touch, although I prized it\r\nhighly and considered it a grand and original idea, would no doubt have\r\nexcited only ridicule and contempt had it been seen by a naval man.\r\n\r\nMy contrivance was this: I had a couple of large air-tight bags, made\r\nof the skins of the dog-fish, well tarred and pitched, inflated, and\r\nmade fast on each side of the boat, just above the level of the water.\r\nThese floats, however much she might be loaded, would effectually\r\nprevent either the sinking or capsizing of my craft.\r\n\r\nI may as well relate in this place what I omitted at the time of its\r\noccurrence. During the rainy season our cow presented us with a\r\nbull-calf, and that there might never be any difficulty in managing\r\nhim, I at a very early age, pierced his nose and placed a short stick\r\nin it, to be exchanged for a ring when he was old enough. The question\r\nnow came to be, who should be his master, and to what should we train\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n`Why not teach him,' said Fritz, `to fight with wild animals and\r\ndefend us, like the fighting bulls of the Hottentots? That would be\r\nreally useful!'\r\n\r\n`I am sure I should much prefer a gentle bull to a fighting one!'\r\nexclaimed his mother. `But do you mean to say tame oxen can be taught\r\nto act rationally on the defensive?'\r\n\r\n`I can but repeat what I have heard or read,' replied I, `as regards\r\nthe race of Hottentots who inhabit the south of Africa, among all sorts\r\nof wild and ferocious animals.\r\n\r\n`The wealth of these people consists solely in their flocks and herds,\r\nand for their protection, they train their bulls to act as guards.\r\n\r\n`These courageous animals keep the rest from straying away, and when\r\ndanger threatens, they give instant notice of it, drive the herd\r\ntogether in a mass, the calves and young cows being placed in the\r\ncentre; around them the bulls and strong oxen make a formidable circle\r\nwith their horned heads turned to the front, offering determined\r\nresistance to the fiercest foe.\r\n\r\n`These fighting bulls will even sometimes rush with dreadful bellowing\r\nto meet the enemy; and should it be a mighty lion or other strong and\r\ndaring monster, sacrifice their own lives in defence of the herd.\r\n\r\n`It is said that formerly, when Hottentot tribes made war on one\r\nanother, it was not unusual to place a troop of these stout-hearted\r\nwarriors in the van of the little army, when their heroism led to\r\ndecisive victory on one side or the other.\r\n\r\n`But,' continued, I, `although I can see you are all delighted with my\r\ndescription of these fine warlike animals, I think we had better train\r\nthis youngster to be a peaceable bull. Who is to have charge of him?'\r\n\r\nErnest thought it would be more amusing to train his monkey than a\r\ncalf. Jack, with the buffalo and his hunting jackal, had quite enough\r\non his hands. Fritz was content with the onager. Their mother was voted\r\nmistress of the old grey donkey. And I myself being\r\nsuperintendent-in-chief of the whole establishment of animals, there\r\nremained only little Franz to whose special care the calf could be\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n`What say you, my boy--will you undertake to look after this little\r\nfellow?'\r\n\r\n`Oh yes, father!' he replied. `Once you told me about a strong man, I\r\nthink his name was Milo, and he had a tiny calf, and he used to carry\r\nit about everywhere. It grew bigger and bigger, but still he carried it\r\noften, till at last he grew so strong that when it was quite a great\r\nbig ox, he could lift it as easily as ever. And so you see, if I take\r\ncare of our wee calf and teach it to do what I like, perhaps when it\r\ngrows big I shall still be able to manage it, and then--oh, papa--do\r\nyou think I might ride upon it?'\r\n\r\nI smiled at the child's simplicity, and his funny application of the\r\nstory of Milo of Crotona.\r\n\r\n`The calf shall be yours, my boy. Make him as tame as you can, and we\r\nwill see about letting you mount him some day; but remember he will be\r\na great bull long before you are nearly a man. Now what will you call\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n`Shall I call him \"Grumble\", father? Hear what a low muttering noise he\r\nmakes!'\r\n\r\n`\"Grumble\" will do famously.'\r\n\r\n`Grumble, Grumble. Oh, it beats your buffalo's name hollow, Jack!'\r\n\r\n`Not a bit,' said he, `why, you can't compare the two names. Fancy\r\nmother saying, \"Here comes Franz on Grumble, but Jack riding on the\r\nStorm.\" Oh, it sounds sublime!'\r\n\r\nWe named the two puppies Bruno and Fawn, and so ended this important\r\ndomestic business.\r\n\r\nFor two months we worked steadily at our salt-cave, in order to\r\ncomplete the necessary arrangement of partition walls, so as to put the\r\nrooms and stalls for the animals in comfortable order for the next long\r\nrainy season, during which time, when other work would be at a\r\nstandstill, we could carry on many minor details for the improvement of\r\nthe abode.\r\n\r\nWe levelled the floors first with clay; then spread gravel mixed with\r\nmelted gypsum over that, producing a smooth hard surface, which did\r\nvery well for most of the apartments; but I was ambitious of having one\r\nor two carpets, and set about making a kind of felt in the following\r\nway.\r\n\r\nI spread out a large piece of sailcloth, and covered it equally all\r\nover with a strong liquid, made of glue and isinglass, which saturated\r\nit thoroughly. On it we then laid wool and hair from the sheep and\r\ngoats, which had been carefully cleaned and prepared, and rolled and\r\nbeat it until it adhered tolerably smoothly to the cloth. Finally it\r\nbecame, when perfectly dry, a covering for the floor of our\r\nsitting-room by no means to be despised.\r\n\r\nOne morning, just after these labours at the salt-cave were completed,\r\nhappening to awake unusually early, I turned my thoughts, as I lay\r\nwaiting for sunrise, to considering what length of time we had now\r\npassed on this coast, and discovered, to my surprise, that the very\r\nnext day would be the anniversary of our escape from the wreck. My\r\nheart swelled with gratitude to the gracious God, who had then granted\r\nus deliverance, and ever since had loaded us with benefits; and I\r\nresolved to set tomorrow apart as a day of thanksgiving, in joyful\r\ncelebration of the occasion.\r\n\r\nMy mind was full of indefinite plans when I rose, and the day's work\r\nbegan as usual. I took care that everything should be cleaned, cleared\r\nand set in order both outside and inside our dwelling: none, however,\r\nsuspecting that there was any particular object in view. Other more\r\nprivate preparations I also made for the next day. At supper I made the\r\ncoming event known to the assembled family.\r\n\r\n`Good people! do you know that tomorrow is a very great and important\r\nday? We shall have to keep it in honour of our merciful escape to this\r\nland, and call it Thanksgiving-Day.'\r\n\r\nEveryone was surprised to hear that we had already been twelve months\r\nin the country--indeed, my wife believed I might be mistaken, until I\r\nshowed her how I had calculated regularly ever since the 31st of\r\nJanuary, on which day we were wrecked, by marking off in my almanac the\r\nSundays as they arrived for the remaining eleven months of that year.\r\n\r\n`Since then,' I added, `I have counted thirty-one days. This is the 1st\r\nof February. We landed on the 2nd; therefore tomorrow is the\r\nanniversary of the day of our escape. As my bookseller has not sent me\r\nan almanac for the present year, we must henceforth reckon for\r\nourselves.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, that will be good fun for us,' said Ernest. `We must have a long\r\nstick, like Robinson Crusoe, and cut a notch in it every day, and count\r\nthem up every now and then, to see how the weeks and months and years\r\ngo by.'\r\n\r\n`That is all very well, if you know for certain the number of days in\r\neach month, and in the year. What do you say, Ernest?'\r\n\r\n`The year contains 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds,'\r\nreturned he promptly.\r\n\r\n`Perfectly correct!' said I, smiling, `but you would get in a mess with\r\nthose spare hours, minutes, and seconds in a year or two, wouldn't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n`Not at all! Every four years I would add them all together, make a\r\nday, stick it into February, and call that year leap year.'\r\n\r\n`Well done, Professor Ernest! We must elect you astronomer royal in\r\nthis our kingdom, and let you superintend and regulate everything\r\nconnected with the lapse of time, clocks and watches included.'\r\n\r\nBefore they went to sleep, I could hear my boys whispering among\r\nthemselves, about `father's mysterious allusions' to next day's\r\nfestival and rejoicings; but I offered no explanation, and went to\r\nsleep, little guessing that the rogues had laid a counter-plot, far\r\nmore surprising than my simple plan for their diversion.\r\n\r\nNothing less than a roar of artillery startled me from sleep at\r\ndaybreak next morning. I sprang up and found my wife as much alarmed as\r\nI was by the noise, otherwise I should have been inclined to believe it\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\n`Fritz! Dress quickly and come with me!' cried I, turning to his\r\nhammock. Lo, it was empty! Neither he nor Jack were to be seen.\r\n\r\nAltogether bewildered, I was hastily dressing, when their voices were\r\nheard, and they rushed in shouting:\r\n\r\n`Hurrah! Didn't we rouse you with a right good thundering salute?'\r\n\r\nBut perceiving at a glance that we had been seriously alarmed, Fritz\r\nhastened to apologize for the thoughtless way in which they had sought\r\nto do honour to the Day of Thanksgiving, without considering that an\r\nunexpected cannon-shot would startle us unpleasantly from our slumbers.\r\n\r\nWe readily forgave the authors of our alarm, in consideration of the\r\ngood intention which had prompted the deed, and, satisfied that the day\r\nhad at least been duly inaugurated, we all went quietly to breakfast.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we sat together for a long time, enjoying the calm beauty of\r\nthe morning, and talking of all that had taken place on the memorable\r\ndays of the storm a year ago; for I desired that the awful events of\r\nthat time should live in the remembrance of my children with a\r\ndeepening sense of gratitude of our deliverance.\r\n\r\nTherefore I read aloud passages from my journal, as well as many\r\nbeautiful verses from the Psalms, expressive of joyful praise and\r\nthanksgiving, so that even the youngest among us was impressed and\r\nsolemnized at the recollections of escape from a terrible death, and\r\nalso led to bless and praise the name of the Lord our Deliverer.\r\n\r\nDinner followed shortly after this happy service, and I then announced\r\nfor the afternoon a `Grand Display of Athletic Sports', in which I and\r\nmy wife were to be spectators and judges.\r\n\r\n`Father, what a grand idea!'\r\n\r\n`Oh, how jolly! Are we to run races?'\r\n\r\n`And prizes! Will there be prizes, father?'\r\n\r\n`The judges offer prizes for competition in every sort of manly\r\nexercise,' replied I. `Shooting, running, riding, leaping, climbing,\r\nswimming, we will have an exhibition of your skill in all. Now for it!\r\n\r\n`Trumpeters! Sound for the opening of the lists.'\r\n\r\nUttering these last words in a stentorian voice and wildly waving my\r\narms towards a shady spot, where the ducks and geese were quietly\r\nresting, had the absurd effect I intended.\r\n\r\nUp they all started in a fright, gabbling and quacking loudly, to the\r\ninfinite amusement of the children, who began to bustle about in eager\r\npreparations for the contest, and begging to know with what they were\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\n`Let us have shooting first, and the rest when the heat of the day\r\ndeclines. Here is a mark I have got ready for you,' said I, producing a\r\nboard roughly shaped like a kangaroo, and of about the size of one.\r\nThis target was admired, but Jack could not rest satisfied till he had\r\nadded ears, and a long leather strap for a tail.\r\n\r\nIt was then fixed in the attitude most characteristic of the creature,\r\nand the distance for firing measured off. Each of the three competitors\r\nwas to fire twice.\r\n\r\nFritz hit the kangaroo's head each time; Ernest hit the body once; and\r\nJack, by a lucky chance, shot the ears clean away from the head, which\r\nfeat raised a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\nA second trial with pistols ensued, in which Fritz again came off\r\nvictor.\r\n\r\nThen desiring the competitors to load with small shot, I threw a\r\nlittle board as high as I possibly could up in the air, each in turn\r\naiming at and endeavouring to hit it before it touched the ground.\r\n\r\nIn this I found to my surprise that the sedate Ernest succeeded quite\r\nas well as his more impetuous brother Fritz.\r\n\r\nAs for Jack, his flying board escaped wholly uninjured. After this\r\nfollowed archery, which I liked to encourage, foreseeing that a time\r\nmight come when ammunition would fail; and in this practise I saw with\r\npleasure that my elder sons were really skilful, while even little\r\nFranz acquitted himself well.\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, and then I started a running match. Fritz, Ernest and\r\nJack were to run to Falconhurst, by the most direct path. The first to\r\nreach the tree was to bring me, in proof of his success, a penknife I\r\nhad accidentally left on the table in my sleeping-room.\r\n\r\nAt a given signal, away went the racers in fine style. Fritz and Jack,\r\nputting forth all their powers, took the lead at once, running in\r\nadvance of Ernest, who started at a good steady pace, which I predicted\r\nhe would be better able to maintain than such a furious rate as his\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nBut long before we expected to see them back, a tremendous noise of\r\ngalloping caused us to look with surprise towards the bridge, and Jack\r\nmade his appearance, thundering along on his buffalo, with the onager\r\nand the donkey tearing after him riderless, and the whole party in the\r\nwildest spirits.\r\n\r\n`Hollo!' cried I. `What sort of foot-race do you call this, Master\r\nJack?'\r\n\r\nHe shouted merrily as he dashed up to us; then flinging himself off,\r\nand saluting us in a playful way:\r\n\r\n`I very soon saw,' said he, `that I hadn't a chance; so renouncing all\r\nidea of the prize, I caught Storm, and made him gallop home with me, to\r\nbe in time to see the others come puffing in. Lightfoot and old Grizzle\r\nchose to join me--I never invited them!'\r\n\r\nBy and by the other boys arrived, Ernest holding up the knife in token\r\nof being the winner; and after hearing all particulars about the\r\nrunning, and that he had reached Falconhurst two minutes before Fritz,\r\nwe proceeded to test the climbing powers of the youthful athletes.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise Jack performed wonders. He ascended with remarkable\r\nagility the highest palms whose stems he could clasp.\r\n\r\nAnd when he put on the shark-skin buskins, which enabled him to take\r\nfirm hold of larger trees, he played antics like a squirrel or a\r\nmonkey: peeping and grinning at us, at first on one side of the stem,\r\nand then on the other, in a most diverting way.\r\n\r\nFritz and Ernest climbed well, but could not come near the grace and\r\nskill of their active and lively young brother.\r\n\r\nRiding followed, and marvellous feats were performed, Fritz and Jack\r\nproving themselves very equal in their management of their different\r\nsteeds. I thought the riding was over, when little Franz appeared from\r\nthe stable in the cave, leading young Grumble the bull-calf, with a\r\nneat saddle of kangaroo hide, and a bridle passed through his nose\r\nring.\r\n\r\nThe child saluted us with a pretty little air of confidence,\r\nexclaiming:\r\n\r\n`Now, most learned judges, prepare to see something quite new and\r\nwonderful! The great bull-tamer, Milo of Crotona, desires the honour of\r\nexhibiting before you.'\r\n\r\nThen taking a whip, and holding the end of a long cord he made the\r\nanimal, at the word of command, walk, trot and gallop in a circle round\r\nhim. He afterwards mounted, and showed off Grumble's somewhat awkward\r\npaces.\r\n\r\nThe sports were concluded by swimming-matches, and the competitors\r\nfound a plunge in salt water very refreshing after their varied\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nFritz showed himself a master in the art. At home in the element, no\r\nmovement betokened either exertion or weariness. Ernest exhibited too\r\nmuch anxiety and effort, while Jack was far too violent and hasty, and\r\nsoon became exhausted. Franz gave token of future skill.\r\n\r\nBy this time, as it was getting late, we returned to our dwelling, my\r\nwife having preceded us in order to make arrangements for the ceremony\r\nof prize-giving.\r\n\r\nWe found her seated in great state, with the prizes set out by her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe boys marched in, pretending to play various instruments in\r\nimitation of a band, and then all four, bowing respectfully, stood\r\nbefore her, like the victors in a tournament of old, awaiting the\r\nreward of valour from the Queen of Beauty, which she bestowed with a\r\nfew words of praise and encouragement.\r\n\r\nFritz, to his immense delight, received as the prize for shooting and\r\nswimming, a splendid double-barrelled rifle, and a beautiful\r\nhunting-knife.\r\n\r\nTo Ernest, as winner of the running-match, was given a handsome gold\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nFor climbing and riding, Jack had a pair of silver-plated spurs, and a\r\nriding whip, both of which gave him extraordinary pleasure.\r\n\r\nFranz received a pair of stirrups, and a driving whip made of\r\nrhinoceros hide, which we thought would be of use to him in the\r\ncharacter of bull-trainer.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was supposed to be over, I advanced, and solemnly\r\npresented to my wife a lovely work-box, filled with every imaginable\r\nrequirement for a lady's work-table, which she accepted with equal\r\nsurprise and delight.\r\n\r\nThe whole entertainment afforded the boys such intense pleasure, and\r\ntheir spirits rose to such a pitch, that nothing would serve them but\r\nanother salvo of artillery in order to close with befitting dignity and\r\nhonour so great a day. They gave me no peace till they had leave to\r\nsquander some gunpowder, and then at last their excited feelings\r\nseeming relieved, we were able to sit down to supper; shortly\r\nafterwards we joined in family worship and retired to rest.\r\n\r\nSoon after the great festival of our grand Thanksgiving Day I\r\nrecollected that it was now the time when, the figs at Falconhurst\r\nbeing ripe, immense flocks of ortolans and wild pigeons were attracted\r\nthither, and as we had found those preserved last year of the greatest\r\nuse among our stores of winter provisions, I would not miss the\r\nopportunity of renewing our stock; and therefore, laying aside the\r\nbuilding work, we removed with all speed to our home in the tree, where\r\nsure enough we found the first detachment of the birds already busy\r\nwith the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn order to spare ammunition, I resolved to concoct a strong sort of\r\nbird-lime, of which I had read in some account of the Palm Islanders,\r\nwho make it of fresh caoutchouc mixed with oil, and of so good a\r\nquality that it has been known to catch even peacocks and turkeys.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack were therefore dispatched to collect some fresh\r\ncaoutchouc from the trees, and as this involved a good gallop on Storm\r\nand Lightfoot, they nothing loth set off.\r\n\r\nThey took a supply of calabashes, in which to bring the gum, and we\r\nfound it high time to manufacture a fresh stock of these useful\r\nvessels. I was beginning to propose an expedition to the Gourd-tree\r\nwood, regretting the time it would take to go such a distance, when my\r\nwife reminded me of her plantation near the potato-field.\r\n\r\nThere to our joy we found that all the plants were flourishing, and\r\ncrops of gourds and pumpkins, in all stages of ripeness, covered the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSelecting a great number suited to our purpose, we hastened home, and\r\nbegan the manufacture of basins, dishes, plates, flasks and spoons of\r\nall sorts and sizes, with even greater success than before.\r\n\r\nWhen the riders returned with the caoutchouc, they brought several\r\nnovelties besides.\r\n\r\nA crane, for example, shot by Fritz, and an animal which they called a\r\nmarmot, but which to me seemed much more like a badger.\r\n\r\nAniseed, turpentine and wax berries for candles, they had also\r\ncollected, and a curious root which they introduced by the name of the\r\nmonkey plant.\r\n\r\n`And pray wherefore \"monkey plant\", may I ask?'\r\n\r\n`Well, for this reason, father,' answered Fritz. `We came upon an open\r\nspace in the forest near Woodlands, and perceived a troop of monkeys,\r\napparently engaged as Jack said, in cultivating the soil! Being curious\r\nto make out what they were at, we tied up the dogs, as well as Storm\r\nand Lightfoot, and crept near enough to see that the apes were most\r\nindustriously grubbing up and eating roots. This they did in a way that\r\nnearly choked us with laughter, for when the root was rather hard to\r\npull up, and the leaves were torn off, they seized it firmly in their\r\nteeth, and flung themselves fairly heels-over-head in the most\r\nludicrous fashion you ever saw, and up came the root unable to resist\r\nthe leverage!\r\n\r\n`Of course we wanted to see what this dainty morsel was like, so we\r\nloosed the dogs, and the apes cleared out double quick, leaving plenty\r\nof the roots about. We tasted them, and thought them very nice. Will\r\nyou try one?'\r\n\r\nThe plant was quite new to me, but I imagined it might be what is\r\ncalled in China 'ginseng', and there prized and valued beyond\r\neverything. The children being curious to hear more about this\r\nginseng, I continued:\r\n\r\n`In China it is considered so strengthening and wholesome, that it is\r\nused as a sort of universal medicine, being supposed to prolong human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n`The emperor alone has the right to permit it to be gathered, and\r\nguards are placed round land where it grows.\r\n\r\n`Ginseng is to be found in Tartary, and has lately been discovered in\r\nCanada; it is cultivated in Pennsylvania, because the Americans\r\nintroduce it secretly into China as smuggled merchandise.'\r\n\r\nFritz then continued:\r\n\r\n`After this we went on to Woodlands; but mercy on us! What a confusion\r\nthe place was in! Everything smashed or torn, and covered with mud and\r\ndirt; the fowls terrified, the sheep and goats scattered, the contents\r\nof the rooms dashed about as if a whirlwind had swept through the\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\n`What!' I exclaimed, while my wife looked horrified at the news,\r\nconjuring up in her imagination hordes of savages who would soon come\r\nand lay waste Falconhurst and Tentholm as well as Woodlands.\r\n\r\n`How can that have happened? Did you discover the authors of all this\r\nmischief?'\r\n\r\n`Oh,' said Jack, `it was easy to see that those dreadful monkeys had\r\ndone it all. First they must have got into the yards and sheds, and\r\nhunted the fowls and creatures about; and then I daresay the cunning\r\nrascals put a little monkey in at some small opening, and bid him\r\nunfasten the shutters--you know what nimble fingers they have. Then of\r\ncourse the whole posse of them swarmed into our nice tidy cottage and\r\nskylarked with every single thing they could lay paws on, till perhaps\r\nthey got hungry all at once, and bethought them of the \"ginseng\", as\r\nyou call it, out in the woods yonder, where we found them so busy\r\nrefreshing themselves, the mischievous villains!'\r\n\r\n`While we were gazing at all this ruin in a sort of bewilderment,'\r\npursued Fritz, `we heard a sound of rushing wings and strange ringing\r\ncries as of multitudes of birds passing high above us, and looking up\r\nwe perceived them flying quickly in a wedge-shaped flock at a great\r\nheight in the air. They began gradually to descend, taking the\r\ndirection of the lake, and separated into a number of small detachments\r\nwhich followed in a long straight line, and at a slower rate, the\r\nmovements of the leaders, who appeared to be examining the\r\nneighbourhood. We could now see what large birds they must be, but\r\ndared not show ourselves or follow them, lest they should take alarm.\r\n\r\n`Presently, and with one accord, they quickened their motion, just as\r\nif the band had begun to play a quick march after a slow one, and\r\nrapidly descended to earth in a variety of lively ways, and near enough\r\nfor us to see that they must be cranes.\r\n\r\n`Some alighted at once, while others hovered sportively over them. Many\r\ndarted to the ground, and, just touching it, would soar again upward\r\nwith a strong but somewhat heavy flight.\r\n\r\n`After gambolling in this way for a time, the whole multitude, as\r\nthough at the word of command, alighted on the rice-fields, and began\r\nto feast on the fresh grain.\r\n\r\n`We thought now was our time to get a shot at the cranes and\r\ncautiously approached; but they were too cunning to let themselves be\r\nsurprised, and we came unexpectedly upon their outposts or sentinels,\r\nwho instantly sprang into the air uttering loud trumpet-like cries,\r\nupon which the whole flock arose and followed them with a rush like a\r\nsudden squall of wind.\r\n\r\n`We were quite startled, and it was useless to attempt a shot; but\r\nunwilling to miss the chance of securing at least one of the birds, I\r\nhastily unhooded my eagle, and threw him into the air.\r\n\r\n`With a piercing cry he soared away high above them, then shot\r\ndownwards like an arrow, causing wild confusion among the cranes.\r\n\r\n`The one which the eagle attacked, sought to defend itself; a struggle\r\nfollowed, and they came together to the ground not far from where we\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n`Hastening forward, to my grief I found the beautiful crane already\r\ndead. The eagle, luckily unhurt, was rewarded with a small pigeon from\r\nmy game-bag.\r\n\r\n`After this we went back to Woodlands, got some turpentine and a bag of\r\nrice--and set off for home.'\r\n\r\nFritz's interesting story being ended, and supper ready, we made trial\r\nof the new roots, and found them very palatable, either boiled or\r\nstewed; the monkey plant, however, if it really proved to be the\r\nginseng of the Chinese, would require to be used with caution, being of\r\nan aromatic and heating nature.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to transplant a supply of both roots to our kitchen\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we were early astir; and as soon as breakfast\r\nwas over, we went regularly to work with the bird-lime. The tough,\r\nadhesive mixture of caoutchouc oil and turpentine turned out well.\r\n\r\nThe boys brought rods, which I smeared over, and made them place among\r\nthe upper branches, where the fruit was plentiful, and the birds most\r\ncongregated.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious number of the pigeons, far beyond those of last year,\r\nreminded me that we had not then, as now, witnessed their arrival at\r\ntheir feeding-places, but had seen only the last body of the season, a\r\nmere party of stragglers, compared to the masses which now weighed down\r\nthe branches of all the trees in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe sweet acorns of the evergreen oaks were also patronized; large\r\nflocks were there congregated; and from the state of the ground under\r\nthe trees it was evident that at night they roosted on the branches.\r\nSeeing this, I determined to make a raid upon them by torchlight, after\r\nthe manner of the colonists in Virginia.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the bird-lime acted well: the pigeons alighting, stuck fast.\r\nThe more they fluttered and struggled, the more completely were they\r\nbedaubed with the tenacious mixture, and at length, with piteous cries,\r\nfell to the ground, bearing the sticks with them. The birds were then\r\nremoved, fresh lime spread, and the snare set again.\r\n\r\nThe boys quickly became able to carry on the work without my\r\nassistance; so, leaving it to them, I went to prepare torches, with\r\npinewood and turpentine, for the night attack.\r\n\r\nJack presently brought a very pretty pigeon, unlike the rest, to show\r\nme, as he felt unwilling to kill it; and seeing that it must be one of\r\nour own European breed, which we wished to preserve until their numbers\r\ngreatly increased, I took the trembling captive, and gently cleaned its\r\nfeet and wings with oil and ashes from the stiff, sticky mess with\r\nwhich it was bedaubed, placing it then in a wicker cage, and telling\r\nJack to bring me any others like it which were caught. This he did; and\r\nwe secured several pairs, greatly to my satisfaction, as having\r\nnecessarily let them go free when we landed, they had become quite\r\nwild, and we derived no advantage from them: whereas now we would have\r\na cot, and pigeon-pie whenever we liked.\r\n\r\nWhen evening drew on, we set out for the wood of sweet acorns,\r\nprovided merely with long bamboo canes, torches and canvas sacks.\r\n\r\nThese weapons appeared very curious, and insufficient to the children;\r\nbut their use was speedily apparent: for darkness having come upon us\r\nalmost before we reached the wood, I lighted the torches, and\r\nperceived, as I expected, that every branch was thickly laden with\r\nortolans and wild pigeons, who were roosting there in amazing numbers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly aroused by the glare of light, confusion prevailed among the\r\nterrified birds, who fluttered helplessly through the branches, dazzled\r\nand bewildered, and many falling, even before we began to use the\r\nsticks, were picked up, and put in the bags.\r\n\r\nWhen we beat and struck the branches, it was as much as my wife and\r\nFranz could do to gather up the quantities of pigeons that soon lay on\r\nthe ground. The sacks were speedily quite full. We turned homewards,\r\nand on reaching Falconhurst, put our booty in safety, and gladly\r\nwithdrew to rest.\r\n\r\nThe following day was wholly occupied in plucking, boiling, roasting\r\nand stewing, so that we could find time for nothing else; but next\r\nmorning a great expedition to Woodlands was arranged, that measures\r\nmight there be taken to prevent a repetition of the monkey invasion. I\r\nhoped, could I but catch the mischievous rascals at their work of\r\ndestruction, to inflict upon them such a chastisement as would\r\neffectually make them shun the neighbourhood of our farm for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nMy wife provided us with a good store of provisions, as we were likely\r\nto be absent several days, while she, with Franz and Turk, remained at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI took with me abundance of specially prepared birdlime, far stronger\r\nthan that which we used for the pigeons; a number of short posts,\r\nplenty of string, and a supply of cocoanut shells and gourds.\r\n\r\nThe buffalo carried all these things, and one or two of the boys\r\nbesides. I myself bestrode the ass, and in due time we arrived at a\r\nconvenient spot in the forest, near Woodlands, well concealed by thick\r\nbushes and underwood, where we made a little encampment, pitching the\r\nsmall tent and tethering the animals. The dogs, too, were tied up, lest\r\nthey should roam about, and betray our presence.\r\n\r\nWe found the cottage quite quiet and deserted; and I lost no time in\r\npreparing for the reception of visitors, hoping to be all ready for\r\nthem, and out of sight before they arrived.\r\n\r\nWe drove the stakes lightly into the ground, so as to form an\r\nirregular paling round the house, winding string in and out in all\r\ndirections between them, thus making a kind of labyrinth, through which\r\nit would be impossible to pass without touching either the stakes or\r\nthe cords.\r\n\r\nEverything was plentifully besmeared with bird-lime; and basins of the\r\nmixture were set in all directions, strewed with rice, maize, and other\r\ndainties for bait.\r\n\r\nNight came without any interruption to our proceedings; and all being\r\nthen accomplished, we retired to rest beneath the shelter of our little\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning we heard a confused noise, such as we knew\r\nbetokened the approach of a large number of apes. We armed ourselves\r\nwith strong clubs and cudgels, and holding the dogs in leash, made our\r\nway silently behind the thickets, till, ourselves unseen, we could\r\ncommand a view of all that went on; and strange indeed was the scene\r\nwhich ensued!\r\n\r\nThe noise of rustling, crackling and creaking among the branches, with\r\nhorrid cries, and shrieks, and chattering, increased to a degree\r\nsufficient to make us perfectly giddy; and then out from the forest\r\npoured the whole disorderly rabble of monkeys, scrambling, springing,\r\nleaping from the trees, racing and tumbling across the grassy space\r\ntowards the house; when, at once attracted by the novelties they saw,\r\nthey made for the jars and bowls.\r\n\r\nThey seemed innumerable; but the confused, rapid way in which they\r\nswarmed hither and thither, made it difficult to judge accurately of\r\ntheir numbers. They dashed fearlessly through and over the palings in\r\nall directions, some rushing at the eatables, some scrambling on to the\r\nroof, where they commenced tugging at the wooden pegs, with a view to\r\nforcing an entrance.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, as they rambled over the place, all in turn became\r\nbesmeared with our bird-lime on head, paws, back or breast. The\r\nwretched predicament of the apes increased every instant.\r\n\r\nSome sat down, and with the most ludicrous gestures, tried to clean\r\nthemselves. Others were hopelessly entangled in stakes and cordage,\r\nwhich they trailed about after them, looking the picture of bewildered\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, endeavoured to help one another, and stuck fast\r\ntogether: the more they pulled, and tugged, and kicked, the worse\r\nbecame their plight.\r\n\r\nMany had the gourds and cocoanut shells lumbering and clattering about\r\nwith them, their paws having been caught when they sought to obtain the\r\nrice or fruit we had put for bait.\r\n\r\nMost ridiculous of all was the condition of one old fellow, who had\r\nfound a calabash, containing palm wine, and, eagerly drinking it, was\r\nimmediately fitted with a mask, for the shell stuck to his forehead and\r\nwhiskers, of course covering his eyes; and he blundered about, cutting\r\nthe wildest capers in his efforts to get rid of the encumbrance.\r\n\r\nNumbers took to flight; but, as we had spread bird-lime on several of\r\nthe trees around, many apes found themselves fixed to, or hanging from\r\nthe branches, where they remained in woeful durance, struggling and\r\nshrieking horribly.\r\n\r\nThe panic being now general, I loosed the three dogs, whose impatience\r\nhad been almost uncontrollable, and who now rushed to the attack of the\r\nunfortunate monkeys, as though burning with zeal to execute justice\r\nupon desperate criminals.\r\n\r\nThe place soon had the appearance of a ghastly battlefield; for we were\r\nobliged to do our part with the clubs and sticks, till the din of\r\nhowling, yelling, barking, in every conceivable tone of rage and pain,\r\ngave place to an awful silence, and we looked with a shudder on the\r\nshocking spectacle around us.\r\n\r\nAt least forty apes lay mangled and dead, and the boys began to be\r\nquite sad and downhearted, till I, fully sharing their feelings,\r\nhastened to turn their thoughts to active employment in removing and\r\nburying the slain, burning the stakes, cordage, bowls, everything\r\nconcerned in the execution of our deadly stratagem.\r\n\r\nAfter that we betook ourselves to the task of restoring order to our\r\ndismantled cottage; and seeking for the scattered flock of sheep,\r\ngoats, and poultry, we gradually collected them, hoping to settle them\r\nonce more peacefully in their yards and sheds.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, we repeatedly heard a sound as of something heavy\r\nfalling from a tree. On going to look, we found three splendid birds,\r\ncaught on some of the limed sticks we had placed loose in the branches.\r\n\r\nTwo of these proved to be a variety of the Blue Molucca pigeon; the\r\nthird I assumed to be the Nicobar pigeon, having met with descriptions\r\nof its resplendent green, bronze, and steely-blue plumage; and I was\r\npleased to think of domesticating them, and establishing them as first\r\ntenants of a suitable dwelling near the cave.\r\n\r\n`First tenants, father!' said Fritz. `Do you expect to catch more like\r\nthese?'\r\n\r\n`Not exactly catch them; I mean to practise a secret art. Much can be\r\ndone by magic, Fritz!'\r\n\r\nFurther explanation I declined to give.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, Woodlands was once more set in order, and everything\r\nsettled and comfortable, so that we returned without further adventure\r\nto Falconhurst, where we were joyfully welcomed.\r\n\r\nEvery one agreed that we must go at once to Tentholm, to make the\r\nproposed pigeon-house in the rock. Several other things there also\r\nrequiring our attention, we made arrangements for a prolonged stay.\r\n\r\nMy plan for the pigeon-house was to hollow out an ample space in the\r\ncliff, facing towards Jackal river, and close to our rocky home,\r\nfitting that up with partitions, perches and nesting-places; while a\r\nlarge wooden front was fitted on to the opening, with entrance-holes,\r\nslides, or shutters, and a broad platform in front, where the birds\r\ncould rest, and walk about.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the work of a few weeks, we thought it was fit for\r\nhabitation, I set the other children to work at some distance from our\r\ncavern, and summoning Fritz:\r\n\r\n`Now, my faithful assistant,' said I, `it is time to conjure the new\r\ncolonists to their settlement here. Yes,' I continued, laughing at his\r\npuzzled look. `I mean to play a regular pigeon-dealer's trick. You must\r\nknow such gentry are very ingenious, not only in keeping their own\r\npigeons safe, but in adding to their numbers by attracting those of\r\nother people. All I want is some soft clay, aniseed and salt, of which\r\nI will compound a mixture, which our birds will like very much, and the\r\nsmell of which will bring others to share it with them.'\r\n\r\n`I can easily get you those things, father.'\r\n\r\n`I shall want some oil of aniseed besides,' said I, `to put on the\r\npigeon-holes, so that the birds' feathers may touch it as they pass in\r\nand out, and become scented with what will attract the wild pigeons.\r\nThis I can obtain by pounding aniseed; therefore, bring me the mortar\r\nand some oil.'\r\n\r\nWhen this was strongly impregnated with the aromatic oil from the\r\nseeds (for I did not purpose to distill it in regular style), I\r\nstrained it through a cloth, pressing it strongly: the result answered\r\nmy purpose, and the scent would certainly remain for some days.\r\n\r\nAll my preparations being completed, the pigeons were installed in\r\ntheir new residence, and the slides closed. The European birds were by\r\nthis time quite friendly with the three beautiful strangers; and when\r\nthe other boys came home, and scrambled up the ladder to peep in at a\r\nlittle pane of glass I had fixed in front, they saw them all\r\ncontentedly picking up grain, and pecking at the `magic food', as Fritz\r\ncalled it, although he did not betray my secret arts to his brothers.\r\n\r\nEarly on the third morning I aroused Fritz, and directed him to ascend\r\nthe rope ladder, and arrange a cord on the sliding door of the\r\ndove-cot, by which it could be opened or closed from below. Also he\r\npoured fresh aniseed oil all about the entrance, after which we\r\nreturned, and awoke the rest of the family, telling them that if they\r\nliked to make haste, they might see me let the pigeons fly.\r\n\r\nEverybody came to the dove-cot, understanding that some ceremony was to\r\nattend the event, and I waved a wand with mock solemnity, while I\r\nmuttered a seeming incantation, and then gave Fritz a sign to draw up\r\nthe sliding panel.\r\n\r\nPresently out popped the pretty heads of the captives, the soft eyes\r\nglanced about in all directions; they withdrew, they ventured forth\r\nagain, they came timidly out on `the verandah', as little Franz\r\nexpressed it; then, as though suddenly startled, the whole party took\r\nwing, with the shrill whizzing sound peculiar to the flight of pigeons,\r\nand circling above us, they rose higher, higher, finally darting quite\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nWhile we were yet gazing after them, they reappeared, and settled\r\nquietly on the dove-cot; but as we congratulated ourselves on a return\r\nwhich showed they accepted this as a home, up sprang the three blue\r\npigeons, the noble foreigners, for whom chiefly I had planned the\r\nhouse, and rising in circles high in air, winged their rapid way direct\r\ntowards Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nTheir departure had such air of determination and resolve about it,\r\nthat I feared them lost to us for ever.\r\n\r\nEndeavouring to console ourselves by petting our four remaining birds,\r\nwe could not forget this disappointment, and all day long the dove-cot\r\nremained the centre of attraction.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was seen of the fugitives until about the middle of\r\nnext day; when most of us were hard at work inside the cavern, Jack\r\nsprang in full of excitement, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n`He is there! He is come! He really is!'\r\n\r\n`Who? Who is there? What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n`The blue pigeon, to be sure! Hurrah! Hurrah!'\r\n\r\n`Oh, nonsense!' said Ernest. `You want to play us a trick.'\r\n\r\n`Why should it be \"nonsense\"?' cried I. `I fully believe we shall see\r\nthem all soon!'\r\n\r\nOut ran everybody to the dove-cot, and there, sure enough, stood the\r\npretty fellow, but not alone, for he was billing and cooing to a mate,\r\na stranger of his own breed, apparently inviting her to enter his\r\ndwelling; for he popped in and out at the door, bowing, sidling, and\r\ncooing, in a most irresistible manner, until the shy little lady\r\nyielded to his blandishments, and tripped daintily in.\r\n\r\n`Now, let's shut the door. Pull the cord and close the panel!' shouted\r\nthe boys, making a rush at the string.\r\n\r\n`Stop!' cried I. `Let the string alone! I won't have you frighten the\r\nlittle darlings. Besides, the others will be coming--would you shut the\r\ndoor in their faces?'\r\n\r\n`Here they come! Here they come!' exclaimed Fritz, whose keen eye\r\nmarked the birds afar, and to our delight the second blue pigeon\r\narrived, likewise with a mate, whom, after a pretty little flirtation\r\nscene of real and assumed modesty on her part, he succeeded in leading\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe third and handsomest of the new pigeons was the last in making his\r\nappearance. Perhaps he had greater difficulty than the others in\r\nfinding a mate as distinguished in rank and beauty as himself. However,\r\nwe fully expected them, and the boys talked of the arrival of `Mr. and\r\nMrs. Nicobar' as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nLate in the day Franz and his mother went out to provide for supper,\r\nbut the child returned directly, exclaiming that we must hasten to the\r\ndove-cot to see something beautiful.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a general rush was made out of the cave, and we saw with\r\ndelight that the third stranger also had returned with a lovely bride,\r\nand encouraged by the presence of the first arrivals, they soon made\r\nthemselves at home.\r\n\r\nIn a short time nest-building commenced, and among the materials\r\ncollected by the birds, I observed a long grey moss or lichen, and\r\nthought it might very possibly be the same which, in the West Indies,\r\nis gathered from the bark of old trees, where it grows, and hangs in\r\ngreat tuft-like beards, to be used instead of horse-hair for stuffing\r\nmattresses.\r\n\r\nMy wife no sooner heard of it, than her active brain devised fifty\r\nplans for making it of use. Would we but collect enough, she would\r\nclean and sort it, and there would be no end to the bolsters, pillows,\r\nsaddles, and cushions she would stuff with it.\r\n\r\nFor the discovery of nutmegs we had also to thank the pigeons, and they\r\nwere carefully planted in our orchard. For some time no event of\r\nparticular note occurred, until at length Jack, as usual, got into a\r\nscrape causing thereby no little excitement at home.\r\n\r\nHe went off early on one of his own particular private expeditions.\r\n\r\nHe was in the habit of doing this that he might surprise us with some\r\nnew acquisition on his return.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, he came back in most wretched plight, covered with\r\nmud and green slime; a great bundle of Spanish canes was on his back,\r\nmuddy and green like himself; he had lost a shoe, and altogether\r\npresented a ludicrous picture of misery, at which we could have\r\nlaughed, had he not seemed more ready to cry!\r\n\r\n`My dear boy! What has happened to you? Where have you been?'\r\n\r\n`Only in the swamp behind the powder magazine, father,' replied he. `I\r\nwent to get reeds for my wickerwork, because I wanted to weave some\r\nbaskets and hen-coops, and I saw such beauties a little way off in the\r\nmarsh, much finer than those close by the edge, that I tried to get at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n`I jumped from one firm spot to another, till at last I slipped and\r\nsank over my ankles; I tried to get on towards the reeds, which were\r\nclose by, but in I went deeper and deeper, till I was above the knees\r\nin thick soft mud, and there I stuck!\r\n\r\n`I screamed and shouted, but nobody came, and I can tell you I was in a\r\nregular fright.\r\n\r\n`At last who should appear but my faithful Fangs! He knew my voice and\r\ncame close up to me, right over the swamp, but all the poor beast could\r\ndo, was to help me to make a row; I wonder you did not hear us! The\r\nvery rocks rang, but nothing came of it, so despair drove me to think\r\nof an expedient. I cut down all the reeds I could reach round and round\r\nme, and bound them together into this bundle, which made a firm place\r\non which to lean, while I worked and kicked about to free my feet and\r\nlegs, and after much struggling, I managed to get astride on the reeds.\r\n\r\n`There I sat, supported above the mud and slime, while Fangs ran\r\nyelping backwards and forwards between me and the bank, seeming\r\nsurprised I did not follow. Suddenly I thought of catching hold of his\r\ntail. He dragged and pulled, and I sprawled, and crawled, and waded,\r\nsometimes on my reeds like a raft, sometimes lugging them along with\r\nme, till we luckily got back to terra firma. But I had a near squeak\r\nfor it, I can tell you.'\r\n\r\n`A fortunate escape indeed, my boy!' cried I, `And I thank God for it.\r\nFangs has really acted a heroic part as your deliverer, and you have\r\nshown great presence of mind. Now go with your mother, and get rid of\r\nthe slimy traces of your disaster! You have brought me splendid canes,\r\nexactly what I want for a new scheme of mine.'\r\n\r\nThe fact was, I meant to try to construct a loom for my wife, for I\r\nknew she understood weaving, so I chose two fine strong reeds, and\r\nsplitting them carefully, bound them together again, that when dry they\r\nmight be quite straight and equal, and fit for a frame. Smaller reeds\r\nwere cut into pieces and sharpened for the teeth of the comb. The boys\r\ndid this for me without in the least knowing their use, and great fun\r\nthey made of `father's monster toothpicks'.\r\n\r\nIn time all the various parts of the loom were made ready and put\r\ntogether, my wife knowing nothing of it, while to the incessant\r\nquestions of the children, I replied mysteriously:\r\n\r\n`Oh, it is an outlandish sort of musical instrument; mother will know\r\nhow to play upon it.'*\r\n\r\n   * He has forgotten his dictum about truth even in jest.\r\n\r\nAnd when the time came for presenting it, her joy was only equalled by\r\nthe amusement and interest with which the children watched her\r\nmovements while `playing the loom', as they always said.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, a beautiful little foal, a son of the onager, was\r\nadded to our stud, and as he promised to grow up strong and tractable,\r\nwe soon saw how useful he would be. The name of `Swift' was given to\r\nhim, and he was to be trained for my own riding.\r\n\r\nThe interior arrangements of the cavern being now well forward, I\r\napplied myself to contriving an aqueduct, that fresh water might be led\r\nclose up to our cave, for it was a long way to go to fetch it from\r\nJackal River, and especially inconvenient on washing days. As I wanted\r\nto do this before the rainy season began, I set about it at once.\r\n\r\nPipes of hollow bamboo answered the purpose well, and a large cask\r\nformed the reservoir. The supply was good, and the comfort of having it\r\nclose at hand so great, that my wife declared she was as well pleased\r\nwith our engineering as if we had made her a fountain and marble basin\r\nadorned with mermaids and dolphins.\r\n\r\nAnticipating the setting-in of the rains, I pressed forward all work\r\nconnected with stores for the winter, and great was the in-gathering of\r\nroots, fruits, and grains, potatoes, rice, guavas, sweet acorns,\r\npine-cones; load after load arrived at the cavern, and my wife's active\r\nneedle was in constant requisition, as the demand for more sacks and\r\nbags was incessant.\r\n\r\nCasks and barrels of all sorts and sizes were pressed into the\r\nservice, until at last the raft was knocked to pieces, and its tubs\r\nmade to do duty in the store-rooms.\r\n\r\nThe weather became very unsettled and stormy. Heavy clouds gathered in\r\nthe horizon, and passing storms of wind, with thunder, lightning, and\r\ntorrents of rain swept over the face of nature from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe sea was in frequent commotion; heavy groundswells drove masses of\r\nwater hissing and foaming against the cliffs.\r\n\r\nEverything heralded the approaching rains. All nature joined in\r\nsounding forth the solemn overture to the grandest work of the year.\r\n\r\nIt was now near the beginning of the month of June, and we had twelve\r\nweeks of bad weather before us.\r\n\r\nWe established some of the animals with ourselves at the salt-cave. The\r\ncow, the ass, Lightfoot, Storm and the dogs, were all necessary to us,\r\nwhile Knips, Fangs and the eagle were sure to be a great amusement in\r\nthe long evenings.\r\n\r\nThe boys would ride over to Falconhurst very often to see that all was\r\nin order there, and fetch anything required.\r\n\r\nMuch remained to be done in order to give the cave a comfortable\r\nappearance, which became more desirable now that we had to live\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nThe darkness of the inner regions annoyed me, and I set myself to\r\ninvent a remedy. After some thought, I called in Jack's assistance, and\r\nwe got a very tall, strong bamboo, which would reach right up to the\r\nvaulted roof. This we planted in the earthen floor, securing it well by\r\ndriving wedges in round it.\r\n\r\nJack ascended this pole very cleverly, taking with him a hammer and\r\nchisel to enlarge a crevice in the roof so as to fix a pulley, by means\r\nof which, when he descended, I drew up a large ship's lantern, well\r\nsupplied with oil, and as there were four wicks, it afforded a very\r\nfair amount of light.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were spent in arranging the different rooms. Ernest and\r\nFranz undertook the library, fixing shelves, and setting the books in\r\norder. Jack and his mother took in hand the sitting-room and kitchen,\r\nwhile Fritz and I, as better able for heavy work, arranged the\r\nworkshops. The carpenter's bench, the turning lathe, and a large chest\r\nof tools were set in convenient places, and many tools and instruments\r\nhung on the walls.\r\n\r\nAn adjoining chamber was kitted up as a forge, with fire-place,\r\nbellows, and anvil, complete, all which we had found in the ship,\r\npacked together, and ready to set up.\r\n\r\nWhen the great affairs were settled, we still found in all directions\r\nwork to be done. Shelves, tables, benches, movable steps, cupboards,\r\npegs, door-handles and bolts--there seemed no end to our requirements,\r\nand we often thought of the enormous amount of work necessary to\r\nmaintain the comforts and conveniences of life which at home we had\r\nreceived as matters of course.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, the more there was to do the better; and I never\r\nceased contriving fresh improvements, being fully aware of the\r\nimportance of constant employment as a means of strengthening and\r\nmaintaining the health of mind and body. This, indeed, with a\r\nconsciousness of continual progress toward a desirable end, is found to\r\nconstitute the main element of happiness.\r\n\r\nOur rocky home was greatly improved by a wide porch which I made along\r\nthe whole front of our rooms and entrances, by levelling the ground to\r\nform a terrace, and sheltering it with a verandah of bamboo, supported\r\nby pillars of the same.\r\n\r\nErnest and Franz were highly successful as librarians. The books, when\r\nunpacked and arranged, proved to be a most valuable collection, capable\r\nof affording every sort of educational advantage.\r\n\r\nBesides a variety of books of voyages, travels, divinity, and natural\r\nhistory (several containing fine coloured illustrations), there were\r\nhistories and scientific works, as well as standard fictions in several\r\nlanguages; also a good assortment of maps, charts, mathematical and\r\nastronomical instruments, and an excellent pair of globes.\r\n\r\nI foresaw much interesting study on discovering that we possessed the\r\ngrammars and dictionaries of a great many languages, a subject for\r\nwhich we all had a taste. With French we were well acquainted. Fritz\r\nand Ernest had begun to learn English at school, and made further\r\nprogress during a visit to England. Their mother, who had once been\r\nintimate with a Dutch family, could speak that language pretty well.\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of discussion, we agreed to study different\r\nlanguages, so that in the event of meeting with people of other\r\nnations, there should be at least one of the family able to\r\ncommunicate with them.\r\n\r\nAll determined to improve our knowledge of German and French. The two\r\nelder boys were to study English and Dutch with their mother.\r\n\r\nErnest, already possessing considerable knowledge of Latin, wished to\r\ncontinue to study it, so as to be able to make use of the many works on\r\nnatural history and medicine written in that language.\r\n\r\nJack announced that he meant to learn Spanish `because it sounded so\r\ngrand and imposing'.\r\n\r\nI myself was interested in the Malay language, knowing it to be so\r\nwidely spoken in the islands of the Eastern Seas, and thinking it as\r\nlikely as any other to be useful to us.\r\n\r\nOur family circle by and by represented Babel in miniature, for scraps\r\nand fragments of all these tongues kept buzzing about our ears from\r\nmorning to night, each sporting his newly acquired word or sentence on\r\nevery possible occasion, propounding idioms and peculiar expressions\r\nlike riddles, to puzzle the rest.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the labour of learning was very considerably lightened,\r\nand everyone came to know a few words of each language.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we amused ourselves by opening chests and packages\r\nhitherto untouched, and brought unexpected treasures to\r\nlight--mirrors, wardrobes, a pair of console tables with polished\r\nmarble tops, elegant writing tables and handsome chairs, clocks of\r\nvarious descriptions, a musical-box, and a chronometer were found; and\r\nby degrees our abode was fitted up like a palace, so that sometimes we\r\nwondered at ourselves, and felt as though we were strutting about in\r\nborrowed plumes.\r\n\r\nThe children begged me to decide on a name for our salt cave dwelling,\r\nand that of Rockburg was chosen unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe weeks of imprisonment passed so rapidly that no one found time hang\r\nheavy on his hands.\r\n\r\nBooks occupied me so much that but little carpentering was done, yet I\r\nmade a yoke for the oxen, a pair of cotton-wool carders, and a\r\nspinning-wheel for my wife.\r\n\r\nAs the rainy season drew to a close, the weather for a while became\r\nwilder, and the storms fiercer than ever. Thunder roared, lightning\r\nblazed, torrents rushed towards the sea, which came in raging billows\r\nto meet them, lashed to fury by the tempests of wind which swept the\r\nsurface of the deep.\r\n\r\nThe uproar of the elements came to an end at last. Nature resumed her\r\nattitude of repose, her smiling aspect of peaceful beauty; and soon all\r\ntraces of the ravages of floods and storms would disappear beneath the\r\nluxuriant vegetation of the tropics.\r\n\r\nGladly quitting the sheltering walls of Rockburg to roam once more in\r\nthe open air, we crossed Jackal River, for a walk along the coast, and\r\npresently Fritz with his sharp eyes observed something on the small\r\nisland near Flamingo Marsh, which was, he said, long and rounded,\r\nresembling a boat bottom upwards.\r\n\r\nExamining it with the telescope, I could form no other conjecture, and\r\nwe resolved to make it the object of an excursion next day, being\r\ndelighted to resume our old habit of starting in pursuit of adventure.\r\nThe boat was accordingly got in readiness; it required some repairs,\r\nand fresh pitching, and then we made for the point of interest,\r\nindulging in a variety of surmises as to what we should find.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a huge stranded whale. The island being steep and\r\nrocky, it was necessary to be careful; but we found a landing-place on\r\nthe further side. The boys hurried by the nearest way to the beach\r\nwhere lay the monster of the deep, while I clambered to the highest\r\npoint of the islet, which commanded a view of the mainland from\r\nRockburg to Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nOn rejoining my sons, I found them only half-way to the great fish, and\r\nas I drew near they shouted in high glee:\r\n\r\n`Oh, father, just look at the glorious shells and coral branches we are\r\nfinding! How does it happen that there are such quantities?'\r\n\r\n`Only consider how the recent storms have stirred the ocean to its\r\ndepths! No doubt thousands of shellfish have been detached from their\r\nrocks and dashed in all direction by the waves, which have thrown\r\nashore even so huge a creature as the whale yonder.'\r\n\r\n`Yes; isn't he a frightful great brute!' cried Fritz. `Ever so much\r\nlarger than he seemed from a distance. The worst of it is, one does not\r\nwell see what use to make of the huge carcase.'\r\n\r\n`Why, make train oil, to be sure,' said Ernest. `I can't say he's a\r\nbeauty, though, and it is much pleasanter to gather these lovely\r\nshells, than to cut up blubber.'\r\n\r\n`Well, let us amuse ourselves with them for the present,' said I, `but\r\nin the afternoon, when the sea is calmer, we will return with the\r\nnecessary implements, and see if we can turn the stranded whale to good\r\naccount.'\r\n\r\nWe were soon ready to return to the boat, but Ernest had a fancy for\r\nremaining alone on the island till we came back, and asked my\r\npermission to do so, that he might experience, for an hour or two, the\r\nsensations of Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nTo this, however, I would not consent, assuring him that our fate, as a\r\nsolitary family, gave him quite sufficient idea of shipwreck on an\r\nuninhabited island, and that his lively imagination must supply the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe boys found it hard work to row back, and began to beg of me to\r\nexert my wonderful inventive powers in contriving some kind of rowing\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n`You lazy fellows!' returned I. `Give me the great clockwork out of a\r\nchurch tower, perhaps I might be able to relieve your labours.'\r\n\r\n`Oh father!' cried Fritz. `Don't you know there are iron wheels in the\r\nclockwork of the large kitchen-jacks? I'm sure mother would give them\r\nup, and you could make something out of them, could you not?'\r\n\r\n`By the time I have manufactured a rowing-machine out of a\r\nroasting-jack, I think your arms will be pretty well inured to the use\r\nof your oars! However, I am far from despising the hint, my dear\r\nFritz.'\r\n\r\n`Is coral of any use?' demanded Jack suddenly.\r\n\r\n`In former times it was pounded and used by chemists; but it is now\r\nchiefly used for various ornaments, and made into beads for necklaces\r\net cetera. As such, it is greatly prized by savages, and were we to\r\nfall in with natives, we might very possibly find a store of coral\r\nuseful in bartering with them.\r\n\r\n`For the present we will arrange these treasures of the deep in our\r\nlibrary, and make them the beginning of a Museum of Natural History,\r\nwhich will afford us equal pleasure and instruction.'\r\n\r\n`One might almost say that coral belongs at once to the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral kingdoms,' remarked Fritz; `it is hard like\r\nstone, it has stems and branches like a shrub, and I believe tiny\r\ninsects inhabit the cells, do they not, father?'\r\n\r\n`You are right, Fritz; coral consists of the calcereous cells of\r\nminute animals, so built up as to form a tree-like structure.\r\n\r\n`The coral fishery gives employment to many men in the Persian Gulf,\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, and other places. The instrument commonly used\r\nconsists of two heavy beams of wood, secured together at right angles,\r\nand loaded with stones. Hemp and netting are attached to the under side\r\nof the beams, to the middle of which is fastened one end of a strong\r\nrope, by which the apparatus is let down from a boat, and guided to the\r\nspots where the coral is most abundant.\r\n\r\n`The branches of the coral become entangled in the hemp and network;\r\nthey are broken off from the rock, and are drawn to the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n`Left undisturbed, these coral insects, labouring incessantly, raise\r\nfoundations, on which, in course of time, fertile islands appear,\r\nclothed with verdure, and inhabited by man.'\r\n\r\n`Why father, here we are at the landing-place!' exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n`It has seemed quite easy to pull since you began to tell us such\r\ninteresting things.'\r\n\r\n`Very interesting, indeed; but did you notice that the wind had\r\nchanged, Jack?' remarked Ernest as he shipped his oar.\r\n\r\nThe animated recital of our adventures, the sight of the lovely shells\r\nand corals, and the proposed work for the afternoon, inspired my wife\r\nand Franz with a great wish to accompany us.\r\n\r\nTo this I gladly consented, only stipulating that we should go\r\nprovided with food, water and a compass. `For,' said I, `the sea has\r\nonly just ceased from its raging, and being at the best of times of\r\nuncertain and capricious nature, we may chance to be detained on the\r\nisland, or forced to land at a considerable distance from home.'\r\n\r\nDinner was quickly dispatched, and preparations set on foot. The more\r\noil we could obtain the better, for a great deal was used in the large\r\nlantern which burnt day and night in the recesses of the cave;\r\ntherefore all available casks and barrels were pressed into the\r\nservice; many, of course, once full of pickled herrings, potted pigeons\r\nand other winter stores, were now empty, and we took a goodly fleet of\r\nthese in tow.\r\n\r\nKnives, hatchets, and the boys' climbing buskins, were put on board,\r\nand we set forth, the labour of the oar being greater than ever, now\r\nthat our freight was so much increased.\r\n\r\nThe sea being calm, and the tide suiting better, we found it easy to\r\nland close to the whale; my first care was to place the boat, as well\r\nas the casks, in perfect security, after which we proceeded to a close\r\ninspection of our prize.\r\n\r\nIts enormous size quite startled my wife and little boy; the length\r\nbeing from sixty to sixty-five feet, and the girth between thirty and\r\nforty, while the weight could not have been less than 50,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe color was a uniform velvety black, and the enormous head about\r\none-third of the length of the entire hulk, the eyes quite small, not\r\nmuch larger than those of an ox, and the ears almost undiscernable.\r\n\r\nThe jaw opened very far back, and was nearly sixteen feet in length,\r\nthe most curious part of its structure being the remarkable substance\r\nknown as whalebone, masses of which appeared all along the jaws, solid\r\nat the base, and splitting into a sort of fringe at the extremity. This\r\narrangement is for the purpose of aiding the whale in procuring its\r\nfood, and separating it from the water.\r\n\r\nThe tongue was remarkably large, soft, and full of oil; the opening of\r\nthe throat wonderfully small, scarcely two inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n`Why, what can the monster eat?' exclaimed Fritz; `he can never\r\nswallow a proper mouthful down this little gullet!'\r\n\r\n`The mode of feeding adopted by the whale is so curious,' I replied,\r\n`that I must explain it to you before we begin work.\r\n\r\n`This animal (for I should tell you that a whale is not a fish; he\r\npossess no gills, he breathes atmospheric air, and would be drowned if\r\ntoo long detained below the surface of the water); this animal, then,\r\nfrequents those parts of the ocean best supplied with the various\r\ncreatures on which he feeds. Shrimps, small fish, lobsters, various\r\nmolluscs, and medusae form his diet.\r\n\r\n`Driving with open mouth through the congregated shoals of these\r\nlittle creatures, the whale engulfs them by millions in his enormous\r\njaws, and continues his destructive course until he has sufficiently\r\ncharged his mouth with prey.\r\n\r\n`Closing his jaws and forcing out, through the interstices of the\r\nwhalebone, the water which he has taken with his prey, he retains the\r\ncaptured animals, and swallows them at his leisure.\r\n\r\n`The nostrils, or blow-holes, are placed, you see, on the upper part of\r\nthe head, in order that the whale may rise to breathe, and repose on\r\nthe surface of the sea, showing very little of his huge carcase.\r\n\r\n`The breathings are called \"spoutings,\" because a column of mixed\r\nvapor and water is thrown from the blow-holes, sometimes to a height of\r\ntwenty feet.\r\n\r\n`And now, boys,' cried I, `fasten on your buskins, and let me see if\r\nyou can face the work of climbing this slippery mountain of flesh, and\r\ncutting it up.'\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack stripped, and went to work directly, scrambling over the\r\nback to the head, where they assisted me to cut away the lips, so as to\r\nreach the whale bone, a large quantity of which was detached and\r\ncarried to the boat.\r\n\r\nErnest laboured manfully at the creature's side, cutting out slabs of\r\nblubber, while his mother and Franz helped as well as they could to put\r\nit in casks.\r\n\r\nPresently we had a multitude of unbidden guests. The air was filled by\r\nthe shrill screams and hoarse croaks and cries of numbers of birds of\r\nprey; they flew around us in ever narrowing circles, and becoming\r\nbolder as their voracity was excited by the near view of the tempting\r\nprey, they alighted close to us, snatching morsels greedily from under\r\nthe very strokes of our knives and hatchets.\r\n\r\nOur work was seriously interrupted by these feathered marauders, who,\r\nafter all, were no greater robbers than we ourselves. We kept them off\r\nas well as we could by blows from our tools, and several were killed,\r\nmy wife taking possession of them immediately for the sake of the\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly time to leave the island, but first I stripped off a long\r\npiece of the skin, to be used for traces, harness, and other\r\nleather-work. It was about three-quarters of an inch thick, and very\r\nsoft and oily--but I knew it would shrink and be tough and durable.\r\n\r\nI also took a part of the gums in which the roots of the baleen or\r\nwhalebone was still embedded, having read that this is considered quite\r\na delicacy, as well as the skin, which, when properly dressed and cut\r\nin little cubes, like black dice, has been compared, by enthusiastic\r\n(and probably very hungry) travellers, to cocoanut and cream-cheese.\r\n\r\nThe boys thought the tongue might prove equally palatable, but I\r\nvalued it only on account of the large quantity of oil it contained.\r\n\r\nWith a heavy freight we put to sea, and made what haste we could to\r\nreach home and cleanse our persons from the unpleasant traces of the\r\ndisgusting work in which we had spent the day.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started at dawn. My wife and Franz were left behind,\r\nfor our proposed work was even more horrible than that of the preceding\r\nday; they could not assist, and had no inclination to witness it.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to open the carcase completely, and, penetrating\r\nthe interior, to obtain various portions of the intestines, thinking\r\nthat it would be possible to convert the larger ones into vessels fit\r\nfor holding the oil.\r\n\r\nThis time we laid aside our clothes and wore only strong canvas\r\ntrousers when we commenced operations, which were vigorously carried on\r\nduring the whole of the day; then, satisfied that we could do so with a\r\nclear conscience, we abandoned the remains to the birds of prey, and,\r\nwith a full cargo, set sail for land.\r\n\r\nOn the way, it appeared to strike the boys (who had made not the\r\nslightest objection to the singularly unpleasant task I had set them)\r\nas very strange that I should wish to possess what they had been\r\nworking so hard to procure for me.\r\n\r\n`What can have made you wish to bring away that brute's entrails,\r\nfather? Are they of any use?'\r\n\r\n`There are countries,' I replied, `where no wood grows of which to make\r\nbarrels, and no hemp for thread, string and cordage. Necessity, the\r\nmother of all the more valuable inventions, has taught the inhabitants\r\nof those countries, Greenlanders, Esquimaux and others, to think of\r\nsubstitutes, and they use the intestines of the whale for one purpose,\r\nthe sinews and nerves for the other.'\r\n\r\nWe were right glad to land, and get rid, for the present, of our\r\nunpleasant materials, the further preparation of which was work in\r\nstore for the following day.\r\n\r\nA refreshing bath, clean clothes, and supper, cheered us all up, and we\r\nslept in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n`Now for the finishing up of this dirty job,' cried I, merrily, as we\r\nall woke up next morning at daybreak. And after the regular work was\r\ndone, we commenced operations by raising a stand or rough scaffold on\r\nwhich the tubs full of blubber were placed and heavily pressed, so that\r\nthe purest and finest oil overflowed into vessels underneath.\r\n\r\nThe blubber was afterwards boiled in a cauldron over a fire kindled at\r\nsome distance from our abode, and by skimming and straining through a\r\ncoarse cloth, we succeeded in obtaining a large supply of excellent\r\ntrain oil, which, in casks and bags made of the intestines, was safely\r\nstowed away in the `cellar', as the children called our roughest\r\nstore-room.\r\n\r\nThis day's work was far from agreeable, and the dreadful smell\r\noppressed us all, more especially my poor wife, who, nevertheless,\r\nendured it with her accustomed good temper. However, she very urgently\r\nrecommended that the new island should be the headquarters for another\r\ncolony, where, said she, `any animals we leave would be safe from apes\r\nand other plunderers, and where you would find it so very convenient to\r\nboil whale-blubber, strain train oil, and the like'.\r\n\r\nThis proposal met with hearty approval, especially from the boys, who\r\nwere always charmed with any new plan; and they were eager to act upon\r\nit at once. But when I reminded them of the putrefying carcase which\r\nlay there, they confessed it would be better to allow wind and storms,\r\nbirds and insects to do their work in purging the atmosphere, and\r\nreducing the whale to a skeleton before we revisited the island.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a rowing-machine kept recurring to my brain, and I\r\ndetermined to attempt to make one. I took an iron bar, which when laid\r\nacross the middle of the boat projected about a foot each way. I\r\nprovided this bar in the middle with ribbed machinery, and at each end\r\nwith a sort of nave, in which, as in a cart wheel, four flat spokes, or\r\npaddles, were fixed obliquely. These were intended to do the rowers'\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThen the jack was arranged to act upon the machinery in the middle of\r\nthe iron cross-bar, in such a way that one of its strong cogwheels bit\r\nfirmly into the ribs, so that when it was wound up, it caused the bar\r\nto revolve rapidly, of course turning with it the paddles fixed at\r\neither end, which consequently struck the water so as to propel the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAlthough this contrivance left much to be desired in the way of\r\nimprovement, still when Fritz and I wound up the machinery, and went\r\noff on a trial trip across the bay, we splashed along at such a famous\r\nrate, that the shores rang with the cheers and clapping of the whole\r\nfamily, delighted to behold what they considered my brilliant success.\r\n\r\nEveryone wanted to go on board, and take a cruise, but as it was\r\ngetting late, I could not consent. A trip next day, however, was\r\npromised to Cape Disappointment and the little settlement of Prospect\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nThis proposal satisfied everybody. The evening was spent in preparing\r\nthe dresses, arms and food which would be required, and we retired\r\nearly to rest.\r\n\r\nIntending to be out all day, the house was left in good order, and we\r\ndeparted on our expedition, provided, among other things, with spades\r\nand mattocks, for I wished to get young cocoanut trees and shrubs of\r\ndifferent kinds, that, on our way back, we might land on Whale Island,\r\nand begin our plantation there.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course towards the opposite side of the bay. The sea\r\nwas smooth, my rowing-machine performed its work easily, and leaving\r\nSafety Bay and Shark Island behind us, we enjoyed at our ease the\r\npanorama of all the coast scenery.\r\n\r\nLanding near Prospect Hill, we moored the boat, and walked through the\r\nwoods to our little farm, obtaining some fresh cocoanuts, as well as\r\nyoung plants, on the way.\r\n\r\nBefore coming in sight of the cottage at the farm, we heard the cocks\r\ncrow, and I experienced a sudden rush of emotion as the sound recalled\r\nin a degree painfully vivid, the recollection of many a ride and walk\r\nat home, when we would be greeted by just such familiar sounds as we\r\napproached some kind friend's house. Here, but for the unconscious\r\nanimals, utter solitude and silence prevailed, and I with my dear\r\nfamily, whose visit would have been hailed with delight in so many\r\nhomes, advanced unnoticed to this lonely cottage.\r\n\r\nSo long had been our absence that our arrival created a perfect panic.\r\nThe original animals had forgotten us, and to their progeny, lambs,\r\nkids, and chickens, who had never seen the face of man, we seemed an\r\narmy of fierce foes.\r\n\r\nThe boys found it impossible to milk the goats, until, by the use of\r\nthe lasso, they captured them one after the other, bound their legs,\r\nthen giving them salt to lick, they soon obtained a supply of excellent\r\nmilk which was poured from the cocoanut shells they used into calabash\r\nflasks, so that we could take with us what was not required at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe fowls were enticed by handfuls of grain and rice, and my wife\r\ncaught as many as she wished for.\r\n\r\nWe were by this time very ready for dinner, and the cold provisions we\r\nhad with us were set forth, the chief dish consisting of the piece of\r\nwhale's tongue, which, by the boys' desire, had been cooked with a\r\nspecial view to this entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut woeful was the disappointment when the tongue was tasted! One\r\nafter another, with dismal face, pronounced it 'horrid stuff,' begged\r\nfor some pickled herring to take away the taste of train-oil, and\r\nwillingly bestowed on Fangs the cherished dainty.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was a sufficient supply of other eatables, and the\r\nfresh, delicious cocoanuts and goat's milk put everyone in good humour\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWhile the mother packed everything up, Fritz and I got some sugar-cane\r\nshoots which I wished to plant, and then returned to the shore and\r\nagain embarked.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Whale Island, I felt a strong wish to round Cape\r\nDisappointment and survey the coast immediately beyond, but the\r\npromontory maintained the character of its name, and we found that a\r\nlong sandbank, as well as hidden reefs and rocks, ran out a great way\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nFritz espying breakers ahead, we put about at once, and aided by a\r\nlight breeze, directed our course towards Whale Island.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I began at once to plant the sugar-cane shoots we had\r\nbrought. The boys assisted me for a while, but wearied somewhat of the\r\noccupation, and one after another went off in search of shells and\r\ncoral, leaving their mother and me to finish the work.\r\n\r\nPresently Jack came back, shouting loudly:\r\n\r\n`Father! Mother! Do come and look. There is an enormous skeleton lying\r\nhere; the skeleton of some fearful great beast--a mammoth, I should\r\nthink.'\r\n\r\n`Why Jack!' returned I laughing, `have you forgot our old\r\nacquaintance, the whale? What else could it be?'\r\n\r\n`Oh no, father, it is not the whale. This thing has not fish bones, but\r\nreal good, honest, huge, beast bones. I don't know what can have become\r\nof the whale--floated out to sea most likely. This mammoth is ever so\r\nmuch bigger. Come and see!'\r\n\r\nAs I was about to follow the boy, a voice from another direction\r\nsuddenly cried:\r\n\r\n`Father! Father! A great enormous turtle! Please make haste. It is\r\nwaddling back to the sea as hard as it can go, and we can't stop it.'\r\n\r\nThis appeal being more pressing, as well as more important, than\r\nJack's, I snatched up an oar and hastened to their assistance.\r\n\r\nSure enough a large turtle was scrambling quickly towards the water,\r\nand was within a few paces of it, although Ernest was valiantly holding\r\non by one of its hind legs.\r\n\r\nI sprang down the bank, and making use of the oar as a lever, we\r\nsucceeded with some difficulty in turning the creature on its back.\r\n\r\nIt was a huge specimen, fully eight feet long, and being now quite\r\nhelpless, we left it sprawling, and went to inspect Jack's mammoth\r\nskeleton, which, of course, proved to be neither more nor less than\r\nthat of the whale. I convinced him of the fact by pointing out the\r\nmarks of our feet on the ground, and the broken jaws where we had\r\nhacked out the whalebone.\r\n\r\n`What can have made you take up that fancy about a mammoth, my boy?'\r\n\r\n`Ernest put it into my head, father. He said there seemed to be the\r\nskeleton of an antediluvian monster there, so I ran to look closer, and\r\nI never thought of the whale, when I saw no fish bones. I suppose\r\nErnest was joking.'\r\n\r\n`Whales are generally considered as fishes by those little acquainted\r\nwith the animal kingdom, but they belong to the class of mammals, which\r\ncomprises man, the monkey tribes, the bats, the dogs and cats, all\r\nhoofed animals, whales and their allies, with other animals, the last\r\non the list being the sloth.\r\n\r\n`The name by which they are distinguished is derived from the Latin\r\nword \"mama,\" a breast, and is given to them because all the species\r\nbelonging to this class are furnished with a set of organs called the\r\nmammary glands, secreting the liquid known as milk, by which the young\r\nare nourished.\r\n\r\n`The bones of the whale differ from those of animals, simply in being\r\nof a hollow construction, and filled with air so as to render the\r\ncarcase more buoyant. The bones of birds are also hollow, for the same\r\nreason, and in all this we see conspicuously the wisdom and goodness of\r\nthe great Creator.'\r\n\r\n`What a marvellous structure it is, father!' said Fritz. `What a\r\nponderous mass of bones! Can we not make use of any of them?'\r\n\r\n`Nothing strikes me at this moment; we will leave them to bleach here\r\nyet awhile, and perhaps by sawing them up afterwards, make a few\r\nchairs, or a reading-desk for the museum. But now it is time to return\r\nhome. Bring the boat round to where the turtle awaits his fate; we must\r\nsettle how to deal with him.'\r\n\r\nIt was soon decided that he must swim. I fastened the empty water-cask\r\nto a long line, one end of which was made fast to the bow of the boat,\r\nthe other carefully passed round the neck and fore-paws of the\r\ncreature, who was then lifted, so as to let him regain his feet; when\r\nhe instantly made for the water, plunged in, the cask floated after\r\nhim, and prevented his sinking.\r\n\r\nWe were all on board in a moment; and the worthy fellow, after vainly\r\nattempting to dive, set himself diligently to swim right forwards,\r\ntowing us comfortably after him. I was ready to cut the line on the\r\nleast appearance of danger, and kept him on the course for Safety Bay\r\nby striking the water with a boat-hook right or left, according as the\r\nturtle was disposed to turn too much one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe boys were delighted with the fun, and compared me to Neptune in his\r\ncar, drawn by dolphins, and accompanied by Amphitrite and attendant\r\nTritons.\r\n\r\nWe landed safely at the usual place, near Rockburg, and the turtle was\r\ncondemned and executed soon afterwards; the shell, which was quite\r\neight feet long, and three broad, was, when cleaned and prepared, to\r\nform a trough for the water supply at the cave, and the meat was\r\ncarefully salted, and stored up for many a good and savoury meal.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to bring a piece of land under cultivation\r\nbefore the next rainy season, to be sown with different sorts of grain;\r\nbut many unforeseen circumstances had intervened to hinder this, and\r\nour animals, unaccustomed to the yoke, were not available for the\r\nplough.\r\n\r\nI therefore gave up the idea for the present, and applied myself, with\r\nErnest's assistance, to completing the loom, which, although the\r\nworkmanship was clumsy, I succeeded in making quite fit for use. I had\r\nfortunately in my younger days spent many hours in the workshops of\r\nweavers and other artisans, and therefore I understood more than might\r\nhave been expected of their various crafts.\r\n\r\nPaste or size was required to smear over the threads; but we could not\r\nspare flour for such a purpose, and I used isinglass, which kept the\r\nwarp moist perfectly well, and spared us the necessity of setting up\r\nthe loom in a damp uncomfortable place, which has often to be done to\r\nprevent the overdrying of the web.\r\n\r\nOf this isinglass I also made thin plates, to be used as window-panes;\r\nthey were at least as transparent as horn, and when fixed deep in the\r\nrock and beyond the reach of rain, did good service in admitting light.\r\n\r\nSuccess encouraging me to persevere, I next began harness-making; the\r\nspoils of the chase having furnished us with plenty of leather, with\r\nwhich I covered light frames of wood, using the hairy moss or lichen\r\nfor stuffing, and ere long the animals were equipped with saddles,\r\nstirrups, bridles, yokes and collars, to the very great satisfaction of\r\ntheir youthful riders and drivers.\r\n\r\nThis occupation was followed by a great deal of work connected with the\r\nannual return of the herring shoals which now took place; to them\r\nsucceeding, as on former occasions, shoals of other fish, and many\r\nseals. More than ever aware of the value of all of these, we did not\r\nfail to make good use of our opportunities, and captured large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe boys were getting anxious for another shooting expedition; but\r\nbefore undertaking that, I wished to do some basket-making, as sacks\r\nwere beginning to fail us, and there was constant demand for baskets in\r\nwhich to carry and keep our roots and fruits. Our first attempts were\r\nclumsy enough; but, as usual, perseverance was rewarded, and we\r\nproduced a good supply of all sorts and sizes. One very large basket I\r\nfurnished with openings through which to pass a strong stick, so that\r\nit might, when heavily laden, be carried by two persons.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the children see the force of this idea, than they got a\r\nbamboo, and popping little Franz into the basket, carried him about in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThis amusement suggested a fresh notion to Fritz. `Oh, father,' cried\r\nhe, `don't you think we might make something like this for mother, and\r\ncarry her much more comfortably than jolting along in the cart?'\r\n\r\nThe boys shouted with glee at the proposal, and though their mother\r\nthought the plan feasible enough, she confessed that she did not much\r\nlike the thought of sitting in the middle of a basket, and just looking\r\nout now and then over the rim.\r\n\r\nHowever, I assured her it should be a well-shaped comfortable\r\nsedan-chair, or litter; and the next question was how it should be\r\ncarried, since the boys could not play the part of Indian\r\npalanquin-bearers, either with safety to their mother, or with any\r\npleasure to themselves.\r\n\r\n`The bull and the buffalo!' cried Jack. `Why not use them for it?\r\nLet's go and try them now!'\r\n\r\nOff ran the boys, and in a short time the basket was securely hung\r\nbetween Storm and Grumble. Fritz and Jack sprang into their saddles,\r\nand Ernest very gingerly deposited himself in the `cradle', as Franz\r\ncalled it; they set forth at a most sober pace, the animals, who were\r\nperfectly docile, appearing only a little surprised at the new\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n`Oh, it is so pleasant, mother, it is a delightful motion,' cried\r\nErnest, as they passed us. `It swings and rocks really soothingly.\r\nQuicker, Fritz! Go quicker!' And the trot pleasing him equally well,\r\nthe pace gradually quickened, till the animals were going along at a\r\nrate which shook and jolted the basket about most fearfully.\r\n\r\nErnest called and screamed in vain for a halt. His brothers thought it\r\ncapital fun to `shake up' the `professor', and made the circuit of the\r\nlevel ground near Rockburg, finally pulling up in front of us, like\r\nperformers stopping to receive the applause of spectators.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to help laughing, the scene was so ridiculous, but\r\nErnest was very angry with his brothers, his reproaches provoked high\r\nwords in reply, and a quarrel was imminent, but I interfered, and\r\nshowed them how easily a joke carried too far would lead to disputes\r\nand bad feeling, urging them to avoid on all occasions any breach of\r\nthe good fellowship and brotherly love which was the mainstay of our\r\nstrength and happiness.\r\n\r\nGood humour was soon restored, Ernest himself helped to unharness the\r\nbeasts, and got some handfuls of salt and barley to reward their\r\nexertions, saying, that they must have some more palanquin-practise\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nI was seated with my wife and Fritz beneath the shade of the verandah,\r\nengaged in wicker-work, and chatting pleasantly, when suddenly Fritz\r\ngot up, advanced a step or two, gazing fixedly along the avenue which\r\nled from Jackal River, then he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n`I see something so strange in the distance, father! What in the world\r\ncan it be? First it seems to be drawn in coils on the ground like a\r\ncable, then uprises as it were a little mast, then that sinks, and the\r\ncoils move along again. It is coming towards the bridge.'\r\n\r\nMy wife took alarm at this description, and calling the other boys,\r\nretreated into the cave, where I desired them to close up the\r\nentrances, and keep watch with firearms at the upper windows.\r\n\r\nThese were openings we had made in the rock at some elevation, reached\r\nwithin by steps, and a kind of gallery which passed along the front of\r\nthe rooms.\r\n\r\nFritz remained by me while I examined the object through my spy-glass.\r\n\r\n`It is, as I feared, an enormous serpent!' cried I. `It advances\r\ndirectly this way, and we shall be placed in the greatest possible\r\ndanger, for it will cross the bridge to a certainty.'\r\n\r\n`May we not attack it, father?' exclaimed the brave boy.\r\n\r\n`Only with the greatest caution,' returned I. `It is far too\r\nformidable, and too tenacious of life, for us rashly to attempt its\r\ndestruction. Thank God we are at Rockburg, where we can keep in safe\r\nretreat, while we watch for an opportunity to destroy this frightful\r\nenemy. Go up to your mother now, and assist in preparing the firearms;\r\nI will join you directly, but I must further observe the monster's\r\nmovements.'\r\n\r\nFritz left me unwillingly, while I continued to watch the serpent,\r\nwhich was of gigantic size, and already much too near the bridge to\r\nadmit of the possibility of removing that means of access to our\r\ndwelling. I recollected, too, how easily it would pass through the\r\nwalls. The reptile advanced with writhing and undulatory movements,\r\nfrom time to time rearing its head to the height of fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet, and slowly turning it about, as though on the look-out for prey.\r\n\r\nAs it crossed the bridge, with a slow, suspicious motion, I withdrew,\r\nand hastily rejoined my little party, which was preparing to garrison\r\nour fortress in warlike array, but with considerable trepidation, which\r\nmy presence served in a measure to allay.\r\n\r\nWe placed ourselves at the upper openings, after strongly barricading\r\neverything below, and, ourselves unseen, awaited with beating hearts\r\nthe further advance of the foe, which speedily became visible to us.\r\n\r\nIts movements appeared to become uncertain, as though puzzled by the\r\ntrace of human habitation; it turned in different directions, coiling\r\nand uncoiling, and frequently rearing its head, but keeping about the\r\nmiddle of the space in front of the cave, when suddenly, as though\r\nunable to resist doing so, one after another the boys fired, and even\r\ntheir mother discharged her gun. The shots took not the slightest\r\neffect beyond startling the monster, whose movements were accelerated.\r\nFritz and I also fired with steadier aim, but with the same want of\r\nsuccess, for the monster passing on with a gliding motion, entered the\r\nreedy marsh to the left, and entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nA wonderful weight seemed lifted from our hearts, while all eagerly\r\ndiscussed the vast length and awful though magnificent appearance of\r\nthe serpent. I had recognized it as the boa constrictor. It was a vast\r\nspecimen, upwards of thirty feet in length.\r\n\r\nI explained to the children that its name in South America is\r\nBoaguacu; the first syllable of that name, with the Latin addition,\r\nwhich indicates that it kills its prey by pressure, or 'constriction,'\r\ngives the name by which it is commonly known.\r\n\r\nThe near neighbourhood of this terrific reptile occasioned me the\r\nutmost anxiety; and I desired that no one should leave the house on any\r\npretence whatever, without my express permission.\r\n\r\nDuring three whole days we were kept in suspense and fear, not daring\r\nto stir above a few hundred steps from the door, although during all\r\nthat time the enemy showed no sign of his presence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we might have been induced to think the boa had passed across\r\nthe swamp, and found his way by some cleft or chasm through the wall of\r\ncliffs beyond, had not the restless behaviour of our geese and ducks\r\ngiven proof that he still lurked in the thicket of reeds which they\r\nwere accustomed to make their nightly resting place.\r\n\r\nThey swam anxiously about, and with much clapping of wings and\r\ndisturbed cackling, showed their uneasiness; finally, taking wing, they\r\ncrossed the harbour, and took up their quarters on Shark's Island.\r\n\r\nMy quandary increased, as time passed on. I could not venture to\r\nattack with insufficient force a monstrous and formidable serpent\r\nconcealed in dense thickets amidst dangerous swamps; yet it was\r\ndreadful to live in a state of blockade, cut off from all the\r\nimportant duties in which we were engaged, and shut up with our\r\nanimals in the unnatural light of the cave, enduring constant anxiety\r\nand perturbation.\r\n\r\nOut of this painful state we were at last delivered by none other than\r\nour good old simple-hearted donkey; not, however, by the exercise of a\r\npraiseworthy quality, but by sheer stupidity.\r\n\r\nOur situation was rendered the more critical from having no great\r\nstock of provisions, or fodder for the animals; and the hay failing us\r\non the evening of the third day, I determined to set them at liberty by\r\nsending them, under the guidance of Fritz, across the river at the\r\nford.\r\n\r\nHe was to ride Lightfoot, and they were to be fastened together until\r\nsafely over.\r\n\r\nNext morning we began to prepare for this by tying them in a line, and\r\nwhile so engaged my wife opened the door, when old Grizzle, who was\r\nfresh and frolicsome after the long rest and regular feeding, suddenly\r\nbroke away from the halter, cut some awkward capers, then bolting out,\r\ncareered at full gallop straight for the marsh.\r\n\r\nIn vain we called him by name. Fritz would even have rushed after him,\r\nhad not I held him back. In another moment the ass was close to the\r\nthicket, and with a cold shudder of horror, we beheld the snake rear\r\nitself from its lair, the fiery eyes glanced around, the dark deadly\r\njaws opened widely, the forked tongue darted greedily forth--poor\r\nGrizzle's fate was sealed.\r\n\r\nBecoming aware on a sudden of his danger, he stopped short, spread out\r\nall four legs, and set up the most piteous and discordant bray that\r\never wrung echo from rocks.\r\n\r\nSwift and straight as a fencer's thrust, the destroyer was upon him,\r\nwound round him, entangled, enfolded, compressed him, all the while\r\ncunningly avoiding the convulsive kicks of the agonized animal.\r\n\r\nA cry of horror arose from the spectators of this miserable tragedy.\r\n`Shoot him, father! Oh, shoot him--do save poor Grizzle!'\r\n\r\n`My children, it is impossible!' cried I. `Our old friend is lost to us\r\nfor ever! I have hopes, however, that when gorged with his prey, we may\r\nbe able to attack the snake with some chance of success.'\r\n\r\n`But the horrible wretch is never going to swallow him all at once,\r\nfather?' cried Jack. `That will be too shocking!'\r\n\r\n`Snakes have no grinders, but only fangs, therefore they cannot chew\r\ntheir food, and must swallow it whole. But although the idea is\r\nstartling, it is not really more shocking than the rending, tearing and\r\nshedding of blood which occurs when lions and tigers seize their prey.'\r\n\r\n`But,' said Franz, `how can the snake separate the flesh from the\r\nbones without teeth? And is this kind of snake poisonous?'\r\n\r\n`No, dear child,' said I, `only fearfully strong and ferocious. And it\r\nhas no need to tear the flesh from the bones. It swallows them, skin,\r\nhair and all, and digests everything in its stomach.'\r\n\r\n`It seems utterly impossible that the broad ribs, the strong legs,\r\nhoofs and all, should go down that throat,' exclaimed Fritz.\r\n\r\n`Only see,' I replied, `how the monster deals with his victim; closer\r\nand more tightly he curls his crushing folds, the bones give way, he is\r\nkneading him into a shapeless mass: He will soon begin to gorge his\r\nprey, and slowly but surely it will disappear down that distended maw!'\r\n\r\nMy wife, with little Franz, found the scene all too horrible, and\r\nhastened into the cave, trembling and distressed. To the rest of us\r\nthere seemed a fearful fascination in the dreadful sight, and we could\r\nnot move from the spot. I expected that the boa, before swallowing his\r\nprey, would cover it with saliva, to aid in the operation, although it\r\nstruck me that its very slender forked tongue was about the worst\r\npossible implement for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to us, however, that this popular idea was erroneous.\r\nThe act of lubricating the mass must have taken place during the\r\nprocess of swallowing; certainly nothing was applied beforehand. This\r\nwonderful performance lasted from seven in the morning until noon. When\r\nthe awkward morsel was entirely swallowed, the serpent lay stiff,\r\ndistorted, and apparently insensible along the edge of the marsh.\r\n\r\nI felt that now or never was the moment for attack!\r\n\r\nCalling on my sons to maintain their courage and presence of mind, I\r\nleft our retreat with a feeling of joyous emotion quite new to me, and\r\napproached with rapid steps and levelled gun, the outstretched form of\r\nthe serpent. Fritz followed me closely.\r\n\r\nJack, somewhat timidly, came several paces behind; while Ernest, after\r\na little hesitation, remained where he was.\r\n\r\nThe monster's body was stiff and motionless, which made its rolling and\r\nfiery eyes, and the slow spasmodic undulations of its tail more fearful\r\nby contrast.\r\n\r\nWe fired together, and both balls entered the skull: the light of the\r\neye was extinguished, and the only movement was in the further\r\nextremity of the body, which rolled, writhed, coiled and lashed from\r\nside to side.\r\n\r\nAdvancing closer, we fired our pistols directly into its head, a\r\nconvulsive quiver ran through the mighty frame, and the boa\r\nconstrictor lay dead.\r\n\r\nAs we raised a cry of victory, Jack, desirous of a share in the glory\r\nof conquest, ran close to the creature, firing his pistol into its\r\nside, when he was sent sprawling over and over by a movement of its\r\ntail, excited to a last galvanic effort by the shot.\r\n\r\nBeing in no way hurt, he speedily recovered his feet, and declared he\r\nhad given it its quietus.\r\n\r\n`I hope the terrific noise you made just now was the signal of\r\nvictory,' said my wife, drawing near, with the utmost circumspection,\r\nand holding Franz tightly by the hand. `I was half-afraid to come, I\r\nassure you.'\r\n\r\n`See this dreadful creature dead at our feet; and let us thank God that\r\nwe have been able to destroy such an enemy.'\r\n\r\n`What's to be done with him now?' asked Jack.\r\n\r\n`Let us get him stuffed,' said Fritz, `and set him up in the museum\r\namongst our shells and corals.'\r\n\r\n`Did anybody ever think of eating serpents?' inquired Franz.\r\n\r\n`Of course not!' said his mother. `Why, child, serpents are\r\npoisonous--it would be very dangerous.'\r\n\r\n`Excuse me, my dear wife,' said I. `First of all, the boa is not\r\npoisonous; and then, besides that, the flesh even of poisonous snakes\r\ncan be eaten without danger; as, for instance, the rattlesnake, from\r\nwhich can be made a strong and nourishing soup, tasting very like good\r\nchicken broth--of course, the cook must be told to throw away the head,\r\ncontaining the deadly fangs.\r\n\r\n`It is remarkable that pigs do not fear poisonous snakes, but can kill\r\nand eat them without injury. An instance of this occurs to my memory. A\r\nvessel on Lake Superior, in North America, was wrecked on a small\r\nisland abounding in rattlesnakes, and for that reason uninhabited.\r\n\r\n`The vessel had a cargo of live pigs. The crew escaped to the mainland\r\nin a boat, but the pigs had to be left for some time, till the owner\r\ncould return to fetch them, but with the small hope of finding many\r\nleft alive.\r\n\r\n`To his surprise, the animals were not only alive, but remarkably fat\r\nand flourishing, while not a single rattlesnake remained on the island.\r\nThe pigs had clearly eaten the serpents.'\r\n\r\n`But might not some other cause have been assigned for their\r\ndisappearance?' asked Ernest. `Suppose, for example, that a great\r\nflight of secretary birds had arrived, they might have cleared the\r\nisland of rattlesnakes.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, what is a secretary bird?' interrupted Franz. `I thought a\r\nsecretary meant a man who wrote letters?'\r\n\r\n`So it does, Franz, and the bird Ernest spoke of has curious long\r\nfeathers projecting from either side of its head, something like pens\r\nstuck behind a man's ear; hence its name.\r\n\r\n`It is perfectly true that it lives on snakes, lizards, toads, and\r\nfrogs, but, Ernest, I cannot give up my pigs; for, in the first place,\r\nthe secretary bird is an inhabitant of Southern Africa, and is never\r\nseen in North America, neither does it ever fly in a flock; still, so\r\nravenous is its appetite, that, no doubt, even one or two, had they by\r\nsome miracle found themselves on Lake Superior, would have been able to\r\ngive a very good account of the deadly reptiles, and at least shared in\r\nthe glory of their extermination.'\r\n\r\nMy wife having gone to prepare dinner, we continued talking as we\r\nrested in the shade of some rocks, near the serpent, for a\r\nconsiderable time. The open air was welcome to us after our long\r\nimprisonment; and we were, besides, desirous to drive off any birds of\r\nprey who might be attracted to the carcase, which we wished to preserve\r\nentire.\r\n\r\nMy boys questioned me closely on the subject of serpents in general;\r\nand I described to them the action of the poison fangs; how they folded\r\nback on the sides of the upper jaw, and how the poison-secreting\r\nglands, and reservoir are found at the back and sides of the head,\r\ngiving to the venomous serpents that peculiar width of head which is so\r\nunfailing a characteristic.\r\n\r\n`The fangs are hollow,' said I, `and when the creature bites, the\r\npressure forces down a tiny drop of the liquid venom, which enters the\r\nwound and, through the veins, quickly spreads over the entire system.\r\nSometimes, if taken in time, cures are effected, but in most cases the\r\nbite of a serpent is followed by speedy death.'\r\n\r\nThe children were much interested in my account of the snake-charmers\r\nof India, how they fearlessly handle the most deadly of the serpent\r\ntribe, the Cobra di Capello-or hooded cobra-, cause them to move in\r\ntime to musical sounds from a small pipe, twine the reptile about their\r\narms and bare necks, and then, to prove that the poison fangs have not\r\nbeen removed, make them bite a fowl, which soon dies from the effects.'\r\n\r\n`How is it possible to extract the fangs, father?' asked Ernest.\r\n\r\n`No instrument is required,' replied I; `I have read the account\r\nwritten by a gentleman in India, who saw a snake-charmer catch a large\r\ncobra in the jungle, and for the purpose of removing the fangs, held up\r\na cloth at which the irritated snake flew, and the fangs being caught\r\nin it, the man seized the reptile by the throat, extracted them, and\r\nthen squeezed out the poison, a clear oily substance, upon a leaf.'\r\n\r\n`What does the rattle of the rattlesnake look like? And how does it\r\nsound?'\r\n\r\n`At the tip of the tail are a number of curious, loose, horny\r\nstructures formed of the same substance as the scales. A very good idea\r\nof the structure of the rattle may be formed by slipping a number of\r\nthimbles loosely into each other.\r\n\r\n`The rattlesnake lies coiled with its head flat, and the tip of its\r\ntail elevated; when alarmed or irritated it gives a quivering movement\r\nto the tail which causes the joints of the rattle to shake against each\r\nother with a peculiar sound, not easily described; all animals, even\r\nhorses newly brought from Europe, tremble at this noise, and try to\r\nescape.'\r\n\r\n`What is the best thing to be done for the bite of a serpent?'\r\ninquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n`Remedies are very various, very uncertain, and differ with the\r\nspecies inflicting the bite.\r\n\r\n`Suction, ammonia, oil, the use of the knife, application of fresh\r\nmold, lunar caustic, leaves of certain plants, all these and more are\r\nmentioned. There is a creeping plant, called Aristolodochia indica, the\r\nleaves of which have in repeated instances done wonders for fearful\r\nbites. It is found in many parts of the world but most plentifully in\r\nthe hotter regions.\r\n\r\n`A mode of cure adopted by the natives of India, Ceylon, and parts of\r\nAfrica, is by the application of a remarkable object called\r\nsnake-stone. These are described as flattish, something like half an\r\nalmond with squared ends, rather light, bearing a very high polish, and\r\nof an intense jetty black.\r\n\r\n`On being bitten by a cobra, the sufferer applies one of these stones\r\nto each puncture, where they adhere strongly for a time, five or six\r\nminutes being about the average. They seem to absorb the blood as it\r\nflows from the wound, and, at the last fall off, when the danger is\r\nconsidered to be over.\r\n\r\n`But now we must leave this fertile subject of discussion, and I can\r\nonly say I sincerely trust we may never have cause to resume it from\r\nthe appearance of another serpent here of any sort, size, or\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n`But come, Ernest, can you not give us an epitaph for our unfortunate\r\nfriend the donkey? We must afford him more honourable sepulture than he\r\nenjoys at present, when we proceed, as we speedily must, to disembowel\r\nhis murderer.'\r\n\r\nErnest took the matter quite seriously, and planting his elbows on his\r\nknees, he bent his thoughtful brow in his hands, and remained wrapt in\r\npoetic meditation for about two minutes.\r\n\r\n`I have it!' cried he. `But perhaps you will all laugh at me?'\r\n\r\n`No, no, don't be shy, old fellow; spit it out!' and thus encouraged by\r\nhis brother, Ernest, with the blush of a modest author, began:\r\n\r\n    `Beneath this stone poor Grizzle's bones are laid,\r\n    `A faithful ass he was, and loved by all.\r\n    `At length, his master's voice he disobeyed,\r\n    `And thereby came his melancholy fall.\r\n\r\n    `A monstrous serpent, springing from the grass,\r\n    `Seized, crushed, and swallowed him before our eyes.\r\n    `But we, though yet we mourn our honest ass,\r\n    `Are grateful; for he thereby saved the lives\r\n    `Of all the human beings on this shore--\r\n    `A father, mother, and their children four.'\r\n\r\n`Hurrah for the epitaph! Well done, Ernest!' resounded on all sides,\r\nand taking out a large red pencil I used for marking wood, the lines\r\nwere forthwith inscribed on a great flat stone, being, as I told the\r\nboy, the very best poetry that had ever been written on our coast.\r\n\r\nWe then had dinner, and afterwards went to work with the serpent. The\r\nfirst operation was to recover the mangled remains of the ass, which\r\nbeing effected, he was buried in the soft marshy ground close by, and\r\nthe hole filled up with fragments of rock.\r\n\r\nThen we yoked Storm and Grumble to the serpent, and dragged it to a\r\nconvenient distance from Rockburg, where the process of skinning,\r\nstuffing, and sewing up again afforded occupation of the deepest\r\ninterest to the boys for several days.\r\n\r\nWe took great pains to coil it round a pole in the museum, arranging\r\nthe head with the jaws wide open, so as to look as alarming as\r\npossible, and contriving to make eyes and tongue which were quite\r\nsufficient to represent nature; in fact, our dogs never passed the\r\nmonster without growling, and must have wondered at our taste in\r\nkeeping such a pet.\r\n\r\nOver the entrance leading to the museum and library were inscribed\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\nNO ADMITTANCE FOR ASSES\r\n\r\nThe double meaning of this sentence pleased us all immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger to which we had yet been exposed was now over, but\r\nthere remained much anxiety in my mind lest another serpent might,\r\nunseen by us, have entered the swamp, or might appear, as this had\r\ndone, from the country beyond Falconhurst.\r\n\r\nI projected then two excursions, the first to make a thorough\r\nexamination of the thicket and morass; the next right away to the Gap,\r\nthrough which alone the archenemy could have entered our territory.\r\n\r\nOn summoning my sons to accompany me to the marsh, I found neither\r\nErnest nor Jack very eager to do so, the latter vowing he had the cold\r\nshivers each time he thought how his ribs might have been smashed by\r\nthe last flap of the snake's tail; but I did not yield to their\r\nreluctance, and we finally set about crossing the marsh by placing\r\nplanks and wicker hurdles on the ground, and changing their places as\r\nwe advanced.\r\n\r\nNothing was discovered beyond tracks in the reeds and the creature's\r\nlair; where the rushes, grass, and bog-plants were beaten down.\r\n\r\nEmerging beyond the thicket we found ourselves on firm ground, near the\r\nprecipitous wall of rock, and perceived a clear sparkling brook flowing\r\nfrom an opening, which proved to be a cave or grotto of considerable\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThe vaulted roof was covered with stalactites, while many formed\r\nstately pillars, which seemed as though supporting the roof. The floor\r\nwas strewn with fine snow-white earth, with a smooth soapy feeling,\r\nwhich I felt convinced was fuller's earth.\r\n\r\n`Well, this is a pleasant discovery!' said I. `This is as good as soap\r\nfor washing, and will save me the trouble of turning soap-boiler.'\r\n\r\nPerceiving that the streamlet flowed from an opening of some width in\r\nthe inner rock, Fritz passed through, in order to trace it to its\r\nsource, presently shouting to me that the opening widened very much,\r\nand begging me to follow him.\r\n\r\nI did so, leaving the other boys in the outer cave, and fired a\r\npistol-shot--the reverberating echoes of which testified to the great\r\nextent of the place; and lighting the bit of candle I always carried\r\nwith me, we advanced, the light burning clear and steadily, though\r\nshedding a very feeble light in so vast a space.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Fritz exclaimed: `I verily believe this is a second cave of\r\nsalt! See how the walls glance! And how the light is reflected from the\r\nroof!'\r\n\r\n`These cannot be salt crystals,' said I, `the water which flows over\r\nthem leaves no track, and tastes quite sweet. I am rather inclined to\r\nbelieve that we have penetrated into a cave of rock crystal!'\r\n\r\n`Oh, how splendid! Then we have discovered a great treasure!'\r\n\r\n`Certainly if we could make any use of it; otherwise, in our\r\nsituation, it is about as valuable as the lump of gold found by good\r\nold Robinson Crusoe.'\r\n\r\n`Anyhow, I will break off a piece for a specimen. See, here is a fine\r\nbit, only rather dull, and not transparent: what a pity! I must knock\r\noff another.'\r\n\r\n`You must go more carefully to work, or it will look as dull as the\r\nfirst. You destroyed its true form, which is that of a pyramid, with\r\nsix sides or facets.'\r\n\r\nWe remained some time in this interesting grotto, but our light burnt\r\nlow after we had examined it in different directions; and Fritz having\r\nsecured a large lump, which exhibited several crystals in perfection,\r\nwe quitted the place, Fritz discharging a farewell shot for the sake of\r\nhearing the grand echoes.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the open air we saw poor Jack sobbing bitterly, but as soon\r\nas we appeared he ran joyfully towards us, and threw himself into my\r\narms.\r\n\r\n`My child, what is the matter?' I cried anxiously.\r\n\r\n`Oh, I thought you were lost! I heard a noise twice, as if the rocks\r\nhad shattered down; and I thought you and Fritz were crushed in the\r\nruins! It was horrible! How glad I am to see you!'\r\n\r\nI comforted the child, and explained the noises he had heard,\r\ninquiring why he was alone.\r\n\r\n`Ernest is over there among the reeds: I daresay he did not hear the\r\nshots.'\r\n\r\nI found Ernest busily engaged in weaving a basket in which to catch\r\nfish: he had devised it ingeniously, with a funnel-shaped entrance;\r\nthrough which the fish passing would not easily find their way out, but\r\nwould remain swimming about in the wide part of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n`I shot a young serpent while you were away, father,' said he. `It lies\r\nthere covered with rushes; it is nearly four feet long, and as thick as\r\nmy arm.'\r\n\r\n`A serpent!' cried I, hurrying towards it in alarm, and fearing there\r\nmust be a brood of them in the swamp after all. `A fine large eel you\r\nmean, my boy. This will provide an excellent supper for us tonight. I\r\nam glad you had the courage to kill it, instead of taking to your heels\r\nand fleeing from the supposed serpent.'\r\n\r\n`Well, I thought it would be so horrid to be pursued and caught that I\r\npreferred facing it; my shot took effect, but it was very difficult to\r\nkill the creature outright, it moved about although its head was\r\nsmashed.'\r\n\r\n`The tenacity of life possessed by eels is very remarkable,' I said. `I\r\nhave heard that the best mode of killing them is to grasp them by the\r\nneck and slap their tails smartly against a stone or post.'\r\n\r\nWe made our way back more easily by keeping close to the cliffs, where\r\nthe ground was firmer, and found my wife washing clothes at the\r\nfountain. She rejoiced greatly at our safe return, and was much pleased\r\nwith the supply of fuller's earth, as she said there was now very\r\nlittle soap left. The eel was cooked for supper, and during the evening\r\na full account was given of our passage through the swamp, and\r\ndiscovery of the rock-crystal cavern.\r\n\r\nIt was most important to ascertain whether any serpent lurked among the\r\nwoods of our little territory between the cliffs and the sea.\r\nPreparations were set on foot for the second and greater undertaking of\r\na search throughout the country beyond the river, as far as the Gap. I\r\nwished all the family to go on the expedition, a decision which gave\r\nuniversal satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIntending to be engaged in this search for several weeks, we took the\r\nsmall tent and a store of all sorts of necessary provisions, as well as\r\nfirearms, tools, cooking utensils and torches.\r\n\r\nAll these things were packed on the cart, which was drawn by Storm and\r\nGrumble. Jack and Franz mounted them, and acted at once the part of\r\nriders and drivers. My wife sat comfortably in the cart, Fritz rode in\r\nadvance, while Ernest and I walked; we were protected in flank by the\r\ndogs and Fangs, the tame jackal.\r\n\r\nDirecting our course towards Woodlands, we saw many traces of the\r\nserpent's approach to Rockburg. In some places, where the soil was\r\nloose, the trail, like a broad furrow, was very evident indeed.\r\n\r\nAt Falconhurst we made a halt and were, as usual, welcomed by the\r\npoultry, as well as by the sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nWe then passed on to Woodlands, where we arrived at nightfall. All was\r\npeaceful and in good order; no track of the boa in that direction; no\r\nsigns of visits from mischievous apes; the little farm and its\r\ninhabitants looked most flourishing.\r\n\r\nNext day was passed in making a survey of the immediate neighbourhood,\r\nat the same time collecting a quantity of cotton, which was wanted for\r\nnew pillows and cushions. In the afternoon Franz was my companion,\r\ncarrying a small gun, entrusted to him for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe took Fangs and Bruno with us, and went slowly along the left bank of\r\nthe lake, winding our way among reedy thickets, which frequently turned\r\nus aside a considerable distance from the water. The dogs hunted about\r\nin all directions, and raised duck, snipe and heron. These usually flew\r\ndirectly across the lake, so that Franz got no chance of a shot. He\r\nbegan to get rather impatient, and proposed firing at the black swans\r\nwe saw sailing gracefully on the glassy surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nJust then a harsh booming sound struck our ears. I paused in wonder as\r\nto whence the noise proceeded, while Franz exclaimed,\r\n\r\n`Oh, father! Can that be Swift, our young onager?'\r\n\r\n`It cannot possibly be Swift,' said I; adding, after listening\r\nattentively a minute or two, `I am inclined to think it must be the cry\r\nof a bittern, a fine handsome bird of the nature of a heron.'\r\n\r\n`Oh! may I shoot it, father? But I wonder how a bird can make that\r\nroaring noise! One would think it was an ox, it is more like lowing\r\nthan braying.'\r\n\r\n`The noise creatures make depends more on the construction of the\r\nwindpipe, its relation to the lungs and the strength of the muscles\r\nwhich force out the breath, than on their size. As for example, how\r\nloud is the song of the nightingale and the little canary bird. Some\r\npeople say that the bittern booms with his long bill partly thrust into\r\nthe boggy ground, which increases the hollow muffled sound of its very\r\npeculiar cry.'\r\n\r\nFranz was very anxious that the first trophy of his gun should be so\r\nrare a bird as the bittern; the dogs were sent into the wood, and we\r\nwaited some distance apart, in readiness to fire.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a great rustling in the thicket. Franz fired, and\r\nI heard his happy voice calling out: `I've hit him! I've hit him!'\r\n\r\n`What have you hit?' shouted I in return.\r\n\r\n`A wild pig,' said he, `but bigger than Fritz's.'\r\n\r\n`Aha! I see you remember the agouti! Perhaps it is not a hog at all,\r\nbut one of our little pigs from the farm. What will the old sow say to\r\nyou, Franz?'\r\n\r\nI soon joined my boy, and found him in transports of joy over an\r\nanimal certainly very much like a pig, although its snout was broad and\r\nblunt. It was covered with bristles, had no tail, and in colour was a\r\nyellowish grey.\r\n\r\nExamining it carefully and noticing its webbed feet, and its curious\r\nteeth, I decided that it must be a capybara, a water-loving animal of\r\nSouth America, and Franz was overjoyed to find that he had shot 'a new\r\ncreature', as he said.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to carry it home, but he very sensibly proposed that\r\nwe should open and clean the carcase, which would make it lighter.\r\nThen, putting it in a game-bag, he carried it till quite tired out; he\r\nasked if I thought Bruno would let him strap it on his back. We found\r\nthe dog willing to bear the burden, and reached Woodlands soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThere we were surprised to see Ernest surrounded by a number of large\r\nrats which lay dead on the ground.\r\n\r\n`Where can all these have come from?' exclaimed I. `Have you and your\r\nmother been rat-hunting instead of gathering rice as you intended?'\r\n\r\n`We came upon these creatures quite unexpectedly,' he replied. `While\r\nin the rice swamp, Knips, who was with us, sprang away to a kind of\r\nlong-shaped mound among the reeds, and pounced upon something, which\r\ntried to escape into a hole.\r\n\r\n`He chattered and gnashed his teeth, and the creature hissed and\r\nsqueaked, and running up, I found he had got a big rat by the tail; he\r\nwould not let go, and the rat could not turn in the narrow entrance to\r\nbite him, but I soon pulled it out and killed it with my stick.\r\n\r\n`The mound was a curious-looking erection, so I broke it open with some\r\ndifficulty, and in doing this dislodged quite a dozen of the creatures.\r\nSome I killed, but many plunged into the water and escaped.\r\n\r\n`On examining their dwelling I found it a vaulted tunnel made of clay\r\nand mud, and thickly lined with sedges, rushes, and water-lily leaves.\r\n\r\n`There were other mounds or lodges close by, and seeking an entrance to\r\none I stretched my game-bag across it, and then hammered on the roof\r\ntill a whole lot of rats sprang out, several right into the bag. I hit\r\naway right and left, but began to repent of my audacity when I found\r\nthe whole community swarming about in the wildest excitement, some\r\nescaping, but many stopping in bewilderment, while others actually\r\nattacked me.\r\n\r\n`It was anything but pleasant, I assure you, and I began to think of\r\nBishop Hatto in the Mouse Tower on the Rhine. Knips liked it as little\r\nas I did, and skipped about desperately to get out of their way, though\r\nhe now and then seized a rat by the neck in his teeth.\r\n\r\n`Just as I began to shout for help, Juno came dashing through the\r\nreeds and water, and made quick work with the enemy, all flying from\r\nher attack.\r\n\r\n`My mother had great difficulty in forcing her way through the marsh to\r\nthe scene of action, but reached me at last; and we collected all the\r\nslain to show you, and for the sake of their skins.'\r\n\r\nThis account excited my curiosity, and I went to examine the place\r\nErnest described: where I found, to my surprise, an arrangement much\r\nlike a beaver dam, though on a small scale, and less complete.\r\n\r\n`You have discovered a colony of beaver rats,' said I to Ernest, `so\r\ncalled from their resemblance in skill and manner of life to that\r\nwonderful creature.\r\n\r\n`Muskrat, musquash, and ondatra are other names given to them. They\r\nhave, you see, webbed feet and flattened tails, and we shall find that\r\nthey carry two small glands containing the scented substance called\r\nmusk. The sooner we strip off the skins the better; they will be useful\r\nfor making caps.'\r\n\r\nWe went back to the house, and met Fritz and Jack just returned from\r\ntheir excursion, reporting that no trace of serpents, great or small,\r\nhad been met with.\r\n\r\nJack carried in his hat about a dozen eggs; and Fritz had shot a\r\ncouple of heath fowls, a cock and hen.\r\n\r\nWe sat down to supper, Franz eager to partake of his capybara. Even he\r\nhimself made a face at the peculiar flavour of the meat.\r\n\r\n`It is the musk which you taste,' said I; and I described to them the\r\nvarious animals in which this strange liquid is found; the musk deer,\r\nmusk ox, crocodile, muskrat of India (also called soudeli, which taints\r\na corked bottle of wine, if it only runs across it) concluding with an\r\naccount of the civet, also called civet-cat.\r\n\r\n`The civet,' said I, `is a handsome black and white animal, and the\r\nperfume obtained from it was formerly considered a valuable medicine;\r\nin the present day it is used chiefly as a scent. This odoriferous\r\nsubstance is secreted, i.e., formed, in a double glandular pouch near\r\nthe tail, and the Dutch keep the creature in captivity, so that it\r\nshall afford them a continual supply.\r\n\r\n`The method of removing the civet perfume is ingenious. The animal is\r\nvery quick and elastic in its movements, and having sharp teeth it is\r\nnot pleasant to handle. So it is put into a long, narrow cage in which\r\nit cannot turn around, a horn spoon is then introduced, and the\r\nperfume, a thick, oily stuff something like butter, is coolly scraped\r\nfrom the pouch, the plundered civet being then released from strait\r\ndurance, until the supply is re-formed.'\r\n\r\nPresently Jack ran for his game-bag, producing some fruit which he had\r\nforgotten. Several pale green apples, quite new to us, excited general\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n`Why, what are those? Are they good?' I asked.\r\n\r\n`I hope so,' said Jack, `but Fritz and I were afraid of eating some\r\nawful poison or other, like the manchineel, so we brought them for the\r\ninspection of the learned Master Knips.'\r\n\r\nI took one and cut it in two, remarking that it contained a circle of\r\nseeds or pips, instead of the stone of the manchineel.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Knips slyly came behind me, and snatching up one half,\r\nbegan to munch it with the liveliest satisfaction, an example which the\r\nboys were so eager to follow that a general scramble ensued, and I had\r\nsome trouble in securing a couple of the apples for myself and their\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nI imagined this to be the cinnamon apple of the Antilles.\r\n\r\nEveryone seeming wearied by the fatigues of the day, our mattresses and\r\npillows were arranged, and the inmates of Woodlands betook themselves\r\nto repose.\r\n\r\nWith early light we commenced the next day's journey, directing our\r\ncourse to a point between the sugar-brake and the Gap, where we had\r\nonce made a sort of arbour of the branches of trees; as this remained\r\nin pretty good condition, we spread a sailcloth over the top of it,\r\ninstead of pitching the tent, and made it very comfortable quarters for\r\nthe short time I proposed to stay there.\r\n\r\nOur object being to search the neighbourhood for traces of the boa\r\nconstrictor, or any of his kindred, Fritz, Jack, and Franz went with me\r\nto the sugar-cane brake, and we satisfied ourselves that our enemy had\r\nnot been there. It was long since we had enjoyed the fresh juice of\r\nthese canes, and we were refreshing ourselves therewith, when a loud\r\nbarking of dogs and loud rustling and rattling through the thicket of\r\ncanes disturbed our pleasant occupation, and, as we could see nothing a\r\nyard off where we stood, I hurried to the open ground, and with guns in\r\nreadiness we awaited what was coming.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes a herd of creatures like little pigs issued from the\r\nthicket, and made off in single file at a brisk trot; they were of a\r\nuniform grey colour, and showed short sharp tusks.\r\n\r\nMy trusty double-barrel speedily laid low two of the fugitives which I\r\nfelt certain to be peccaries; the others continued to follow the leader\r\nin line, scarcely turning aside to pass the dead bodies of their\r\ncomrades, and maintaining the same steady pace, although Fritz and Jack\r\nalso fired and killed several.\r\n\r\nI felt certain that these were peccaries, and recollected that an\r\nodoriferous gland in the back must be removed immediately, otherwise\r\nthe meat will become tainted, and quite unfit to eat.\r\n\r\nThis operation, with the help of my boys, I accordingly performed at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nPresently, hearing shots in the direction of the hut where we had left\r\nErnest and his mother, I sent Jack to their assistance, desiring him to\r\nfetch the cart, that the booty might be conveyed to our encampment,\r\nemploying the time of his absence in opening and cleaning the animals,\r\nthus reducing their weight.\r\n\r\nErnest came back with Jack and the cart, and told us that the\r\nprocession of peccaries had passed near the hut, and that he, with\r\nJuno's help, had secured three of them.\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear this, as I had determined to cure a good supply of\r\nhams, and we made haste to load the cart; the boys adorned it with\r\nflowers and green boughs, and with songs of triumph which made the\r\nwoods ring they conveyed the valuable supply of game to the hut, where\r\ntheir mother anxiously waited for us.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we set to work upon our pigs, singeing and scalding off\r\nthe bristles; I cut out the hams, divided the flitches, bestowed\r\nconsiderable portions of the carcase on the dogs, and diligently\r\ncleansed and salted the meat, while the boys prepared a shed, where it\r\nwas to be hung to be cured in the smoke of fires of green wood.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected business of course detained us in the place for some\r\ntime. On the second day, when the smoking-shed was ready, the boys were\r\nanxious to cook the smallest porker in the Otaheitean fashion. For this\r\npurpose they dug a hole, in which they burnt a quantity of dry grass,\r\nsticks and weeds, heating stones, which were placed round the sides of\r\nthe pit.\r\n\r\nWhile the younger boys made ready the oven, Fritz singed and washed his\r\npeccary, stuffing it with potatoes, onions and herbs, and a good\r\nsprinkling of salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nHe then sewed up the opening, and enveloped the pig in large leaves to\r\nguard it from the ashes and dust of its cooking-place.\r\n\r\nThe fire no longer blazed, but the embers and stones were glowing hot;\r\nthe pig was carefully placed in the hole, covered over with hot ashes,\r\nand the whole with earth, so that it looked like a big mole heap.\r\n\r\nDinner was looked forward to with curiosity, as well as appetite; my\r\nwife, as usual, distrusting our experiments, was not sanguine of\r\nsuccess, and made ready some plain food as a pis aller*.\r\n\r\n   * Last resort, backup, poor substitute.\r\n\r\nShe was well pleased with the curing-hut, which was roomy enough to\r\nhang all our hams and bacon. On a wide hearth in the middle we kindled\r\na large fire, which was kept constantly smouldering by heaping it with\r\ndamp grass and green wood. The hut being closed in above, the smoke\r\nfilled it, and penetrated the meat thoroughly: this process it had to\r\nundergo for several days.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours Fritz gave notice that he was going to open his oven.\r\nGreat excitement prevailed as he removed the earth, turf, and stones,\r\nand a delicious appetizing odour arose from the opening. It was the\r\nsmell of roast pork, certainly, but with a flavor of spices which\r\nsurprised me, until I thought of the leaves in which the food had been\r\nwrapped up.\r\n\r\nThe peccary was carefully raised, and when a few cinders were picked\r\noff, it looked a remarkably well-cooked dish. Fritz was highly\r\ncomplimented on his success, even by his mother.\r\n\r\nThe scented leaves were, I thought, those of a tree which I knew to be\r\nfound in Madagascar, called by the natives ravensara, or 'good leaf.'\r\nIt is said to combine the scent of the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon. The\r\nfruit is a species of nut, possessing the scent of the leaves in a more\r\ndelicate degree, and from it an oil or essence is distilled, which is\r\nhighly valued in native cookery.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of curing our large supply of hams and bacon, which\r\noccupied several days, we roamed about the neighbourhood in all\r\ndirections, finding no trace of the serpent, but making many valuable\r\nacquisitions, among which were some gigantic bamboos from fifty to\r\nsixty feet in length, and of proportionate thickness. These, when cut\r\nacross near the joints, formed capital casks, tubs, and pots; while the\r\nlong sharp thorns, which begirt the stem at intervals, were as strong\r\nand useful as iron nails.\r\n\r\nOne day we made an excursion to the farm at Prospect Hill, and were\r\ngrievously provoked to find that the vagabond apes had been there, and\r\nwrought terrible mischief, as before at Woodlands.\r\n\r\nThe animals and poultry were scattered, and everything in the cottage\r\nso torn and dirtied, that it was vain to think of setting things right\r\nthat day. We therefore very unwillingly left the disorder as we found\r\nit, purposing to devote time to the work afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhen all was in readiness for the prosecution of our journey, we\r\nclosed and barricaded the hut, in which, for the present, we left the\r\nstore of bacon; and arranging our march in the usual patriarchal style,\r\nwe took our way to the Gap, the thorough defence of which defile was\r\nthe main object we had in view.\r\n\r\nOur last halting-place being much enclosed by shrubs, bamboos and\r\nbrushwood, we had during our stay opened a path through the cane\r\nthicket in the direction we were about to travel; this we now found of\r\nthe greatest assistance, and the loaded cart passed on without\r\nimpediment.\r\n\r\nThe ground was open and tolerably level beyond, so that in a few hours\r\nwe arrived at the extreme limit of our coast territory.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the outskirts of a little wood behind which, to the\r\nright, rose the precipitous and frowning cliffs of the mountain gorge,\r\nwhile to the left flowed the torrent, leaving between it and the rocks\r\nthe narrow pass we called the Gap, and passing onward to mingle its\r\nwaters with the sea.\r\n\r\nThe wood afforded us pleasant shelter and standing high, and within\r\ngunshot of the mouth of the rocky pass, I resolved to make it our\r\ncamping-place. We therefore unpacked the cart, and made our usual\r\narrangements for safety and comfort, not forgetting to examine the wood\r\nitself, so as to ascertain whether it harboured any dangerous animals.\r\nNothing worse than wild cats was discovered. We disturbed several of\r\nthese creatures in their pursuit of birds and small game, but they fled\r\nat our approach.\r\n\r\nBy the time dinner was ready we felt much fatigued, and some hours of\r\nunusually sultry and oppressive heat compelled us to rest until towards\r\nevening, when returning coolness revived our strength. We pitched the\r\ntent, and then occupied ourselves with preparations for the next day,\r\nwhen it was my intention to penetrate the country beyond the defile,\r\nand make a longer excursion across the savannah, than had yet been\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for a start at an early hour; my brave wife consented to\r\nremain in camp with Franz as her companion, while the three elder boys,\r\nand all the dogs, except Juno, went with me.\r\n\r\nWe expected to find it somewhat difficult to make our way through the\r\nnarrowest part of the pass, which had been so strongly barricaded and\r\nplanted with thorny shrubs, but found on the contrary that the fences\r\nand walls were broken down and disarranged. It was thus very evident\r\nthat the great snake, as well as the herd of peccaries, had made an\r\nentrance here.\r\n\r\nThis barricade was the first check that had been placed by hand of man\r\nupon the wild free will of nature in this lonely place. With one\r\nconsent storms, floods, torrents, and the wild beasts of the forest,\r\nhad set themselves to destroy it.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to make the defences doubly strong, being convinced that\r\nthe position was capable of being barricaded and fortified so as to\r\nresist the invaders we dreaded.\r\n\r\nThe prospect which opened before us on emerging from the rocky pass was\r\nwide, and varied. Swelling hills and verdant wooded vales were seen on\r\none hand, while a great plain stretched before us, extending from the\r\nbanks of the river towards a chain of lofty mountains, whose summits\r\nwere rendered indistinct in the haze of the distance.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the stream, which we named East River, filling our flasks\r\nwith water, and it was well we did so, for in continuing our journey,\r\nwe found the soil become more arid and parched than we had expected; in\r\nfact we soon appeared surrounded by a desert.\r\n\r\nThe boys were astonished at the altered appearance of the country, part\r\nof which had been explored when we met with the buffaloes. I reminded\r\nthem of the difference of the season; that the expedition had been made\r\ndirectly after the rains, when vegetation had clothed with transient\r\nbeauty this region, which, possessing no source of moisture in itself,\r\nhad become scathed and bare during the blazing heat of summer.\r\n\r\nOur march proceeded slowly, and many were the uncomplimentary remarks\r\nmade on the `new country'.\r\n\r\nIt was `Arabia Petrea,' groaned one.\r\n\r\n`Desert of Sahara,' sighed another.\r\n\r\n`Fit abode for demons,' muttered a third. `Subterranean volcanic fires\r\nare raging beneath our feet.'\r\n\r\n`Patience, my good fellows!' cried I. `You are too easily discouraged.\r\nLook beyond the toilsome way to those grand mountains whose spurs are\r\nalready stretching forward to meet us. Who knows what pleasant\r\nsurprises await us amid their steep declivities? I, for my part, expect\r\nto find water, fresh grass, trees and a lovely resting-place.'\r\n\r\nWe were all glad to repose beneath the shade of the first overhanging\r\nrock we came to, although by pressing further upwards, we might have\r\nattained to a pleasanter spot.\r\n\r\nLooking back towards the Gap, we marked the strange contrast of the\r\nsmiling country bordering the river, and the dreary, monotonous plain\r\nwe had traversed.\r\n\r\nAfter gazing on the distant scene, we produced our store of\r\nprovisions, and were busily engaged, when Knips (our constant\r\ncompanion) suddenly began to snuff and smell about in a very\r\nridiculous way; finally, with a shriek which we knew was expressive of\r\npleasure, he set off at full speed, followed by all the dogs, up a sort\r\nof glen behind us.\r\n\r\nWe left them to their own devices, being far too pleasantly engaged\r\nwith our refreshments to care much what fancy the little rogue had got\r\nin his head.\r\n\r\nWhen hunger was somewhat appeased, Fritz once more cast his eyes over\r\nthe expanse of plain before us, and after looking fixedly for a moment,\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n`Is it possible that I see a party of horsemen riding at full gallop\r\ntowards us! Can they be wild Arabs of the desert?'\r\n\r\n`Arabs, my boy! Certainly not; but take the spy-glass and make them out\r\nexactly. We shall have to be on our guard, whatever they are!'\r\n\r\n`I cannot see distinctly enough to be sure,' said he presently, `and\r\nimagination supplies the deficiency of sight in most strange fashion. I\r\ncould fancy them wild cattle, loaded carts, wandering hay-cocks, in\r\nfact almost anything I like.'\r\n\r\nThe spy-glass passed from hand to hand; Jack and Ernest agreed in\r\nthinking the moving objects were men on horseback; but when it came to\r\nmy turn to look, I at once pronounced them to be very large ostriches.\r\n\r\n`This is fortunate indeed!' I exclaimed. `We must try to secure one of\r\nthese magnificent birds; the feathers alone are worth having.'\r\n\r\n`A live ostrich, father! That would be splendid. Why, we might ride\r\nupon him!'\r\n\r\nAs the ostriches approached, we began to consider in what way we\r\nshould attempt a capture. I sent Fritz and Jack to recall the dogs, and\r\nplaced myself with Ernest behind some shrubs which would conceal us\r\nfrom the birds as they came onwards.\r\n\r\nThe boys did not rejoin us for some little time; they found Knips and\r\nthe dogs at a pool of water formed by a small mountain stream, which\r\nthe monkey's instinct had detected; his sudden departure was thus\r\naccounted for, and they availed themselves right gladly of his\r\ndiscovery, filling their flasks, and hastily bathing before their\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe ostriches continued to come in our direction, varying their pace as\r\nthough in sport, springing, trotting, galloping and chasing each other\r\nround and round, so that their approach was by no means rapid.\r\n\r\nI could now perceive that of the five birds one only was a male, the\r\nwhite plumes of the wings and tail contrasting finely with the deep\r\nglossy black of the neck and body.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the females being ashen brown, the effect of their white\r\nplumes was not so handsome.\r\n\r\n`I do not believe we shall have a chance with these birds,' said I,\r\n`except by sending Fritz's eagle in pursuit; and for that we must bide\r\nour time, and let them come as near as possible.'\r\n\r\n`In what way, then, are ostriches caught by the natives of the African\r\ndeserts?' inquired Fritz.\r\n\r\n`Sometimes by chase on horseback; but their speed is so very great,\r\nthat even that must be conducted by stratagem.\r\n\r\n`When these birds are pursued, they will run for hours in a wide\r\ncircle; the hunter gallops after them, but describes a much smaller\r\ncircle, and can therefore maintain the pace for a longer time, waiting\r\nto make the attack until the bird is fatigued.\r\n\r\n`Among the Bushmen, the hunter sometimes envelops himself in the skin\r\nof an ostrich, his legs doing duty for those of the bird, and his arm\r\nmanaging the head and neck so as to imitate the movements of the bird\r\nwhen feeding. The enterprising hunter is thus enabled to get among a\r\nflock of ostriches, and to shoot them with arrows one after another.\r\n\r\n`When aware of an enemy they defend themselves desperately, using\r\ntheir powerful legs as weapons, always kicking forwards, and\r\ninflicting dreadful injuries on dogs, and even on men if attacked\r\nwithout due precaution. But let us take up our positions, and keep\r\nperfectly still, for the ostriches are at hand!'\r\n\r\nWe held the dogs concealed as much as possible; the stately birds\r\nsuddenly perceiving us, paused, hesitated and appeared uneasy. Yet as\r\nno movement was made, they drew a few steps nearer, with outstretched\r\nnecks, examining curiously the unwonted spectacle before them.\r\n\r\nThe dogs became impatient, struggled from our grasp and furiously\r\nrushed towards our astonished visitors. In an instant they turned and\r\nfled with the speed of the wind; their feet seemed not to touch the\r\nground, their wings aiding their marvellously rapid progress.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they would have been beyond our reach, but as they\r\nturned to fly the eagle was unhooded. Singling out the male bird the\r\nfalcon made his fatal swoop, and, piercing the skull, the magnificent\r\ncreature was laid low. Before we could reach the spot the dogs had\r\njoined the bird of prey, and were fiercely tearing the flesh and\r\nbedabbling the splendid plumes with gore.\r\n\r\nThis sight grieved us. `What a pity we could not capture this glorious\r\nbird alive!' exclaimed Fritz, as we took its beautiful feathers. `It\r\nmust, I am sure, have stood more than six feet high, and two of us\r\nmight have mounted him at once!'\r\n\r\n`In the vast sandy deserts where nothing grows, what can flocks of\r\nthese birds find to live upon?' inquired Ernest.\r\n\r\n`That would indeed be hard to say, if the deserts were utterly barren\r\nand unfruitful,' returned I, `but over these sandy wastes a beneficent\r\nProvidence scatters plants of wild melons, which absorb and retain\r\nevery drop of moisture, and which quench the thirst as well as satisfy\r\nthe hunger of the ostriches and other inhabitants of the wilds. These\r\nmelons, however, do not constitute his entire diet; he feeds freely on\r\ngrasses, dates and hard grain, when he can obtain them.'\r\n\r\n`Does the ostrich utter any cry?'\r\n\r\n`The voice of the ostrich is a deep hollow rumbling sound, so much\r\nresembling the roar of the lion as to be occasionally mistaken for it.\r\nBut what does Jack mean by waving his cap, and beckoning in that\r\nexcited fashion? What has the boy found, I wonder?'\r\n\r\nHe ran a little way towards us, shouting: `Eggs, father! Ostriches'\r\neggs! A huge nest-full--do come quickly!' We all hastened to the spot,\r\nand in a slight hollow of the ground, beheld more than twenty eggs, as\r\nlarge as an infant's head.\r\n\r\nThe idea of carrying more than two away with us was preposterous,\r\nalthough the boys, forgetting what the weight would be, seriously\r\ncontemplated clearing the nest. They were satisfied when a kind of\r\nlandmark had been set up, so that if we returned we might easily find\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\nAs each egg weighed about three pounds, the boys soon found the burden\r\nconsiderable, even when tied into a handkerchief and carried like a\r\nbasket. To relieve them, I cut a strong elastic heath stick, and\r\nsuspending an egg in its sling at each end, laid the bent stick over\r\nJack's shoulder, and like a Dutch dairy-maid with her milkpails, he\r\nstepped merrily along without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nWe presently reached a marshy place surrounding a little pool\r\nevidently fed by the stream which Knips had discovered. The soft\r\nground was trodden and marked by the footsteps of many different sorts\r\nof animals; we saw tracks of buffaloes, antelopes, onagers or quaggas,\r\nbut no trace whatever of any kind of serpent: hitherto our journey in\r\nsearch of monster reptiles had been signalized by very satisfactory\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nBy this brook we sat down to rest and take some food; Fangs presently\r\ndisappeared, and Jack calling to his pet discovered him gnawing at\r\nsomething which he had dug from the marsh.\r\n\r\nTaking it for a root of some sort, Jack brought it for my inspection. I\r\ndipped it in water to clear off the mud, and to my surprise found a\r\nqueer little living creature, no bigger than half an apple, in my hand.\r\nIt was a small tortoise.\r\n\r\n`A tortoise, I declare!' cried Fritz. `What a long way from the sea.\r\nHow came it here, I wonder?'\r\n\r\n`Perhaps there has been a tortoise-shower,' remarked Ernest. `One\r\nreads of frog-showers in the time of the ancient Romans.'\r\n\r\n`Hollo, Professor! You're out for once,' said I. `This is nothing but a\r\nmud-tortoise, which lives in wet, marshy ground and fresh water. They\r\nare useful in gardens; for although they like a few lettuce leaves now\r\nand then, they will destroy numbers of snails, grubs, and worms.'\r\n\r\nResuming our journey, we arrived at a charming valley, verdant,\r\nfruitful, and shaded by clumps of graceful trees. It afforded us the\r\ngreatest delight and refreshment to pass along this cool and lovely\r\nvale, which we agreed to call Glen Verdant.\r\n\r\nIn the distance we could see herds of antelopes or buffaloes feeding;\r\nbut as our dogs continually ranged a long way ahead of us, they were\r\nquickly startled, and vanished up one or other of the narrow gorges\r\nwhich opened out of the valley.\r\n\r\nFollowing the imperceptible windings of the vale, we were surprised, on\r\nquitting it for the more open ground, to find ourselves in country we\r\nwere already acquainted with, and not far from the Jackal Cave, as we\r\ncalled the place where Fangs had been captured in cubhood.\r\n\r\nOn recognizing the spot, Ernest, who was in advance with one of the\r\ndogs, hastened towards it. We lost sight of him for a few minutes, and\r\nthen arose a cry of terror, violent barking and deep, surly growls.\r\n\r\nAs we rushed forward, Ernest met us, looking white as ashes, and\r\ncalling out:\r\n\r\n`A bear, a bear, father! He is coming after me!'\r\n\r\nThe boy clung to me in mortal fear. I felt his whole frame quivering.\r\n\r\n`Courage, my son!' cried I, disengaging myself from his grasp. `We must\r\nprepare for instant defence!'\r\n\r\nThe dogs dashed forward to join the fray, whatever it was; and not long\r\nwere we in doubt. To my no small consternation, an enormous bear made\r\nhis appearance, quickly followed by another.\r\n\r\nWith levelled guns, my brave Fritz and I advanced slowly to meet them.\r\nJack was also ready to fire, but the shock had so unnerved Ernest that\r\nhe fairly took to his heels. We fired together, one at each bear; but\r\nthough hit, the monsters were unfortunately only wounded. We found it\r\nmost difficult to take aim, as the dogs beset them on all sides.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were much disabled, one having the lower jaw broken, and\r\nthe other, with a bullet in its shoulder, was effectually lamed. The\r\ndogs, perceiving their advantage, pressed more closely round their\r\nfoes, who yet defended themselves furiously with frightful yells of\r\npain and rage.\r\n\r\nSuch was the confusion and perpetual movement of the struggle, that I\r\ndared not fire again, seeing that even slightly wounding one of our\r\ngallant hounds would instantly place him in the power of the raging\r\nbears.\r\n\r\nWatching our opportunity, we suddenly advanced with loaded pistols to\r\nwithin a very few paces of the animals, and firing, both fell dead, one\r\nshot through the head, the other, in the act of rearing to spring on\r\nFritz, received his charge in its heart.\r\n\r\n`Thank Heaven!' cried I, as with dull groans the brutes sank to the\r\nground. `We have escaped the greatest peril we have yet encountered!'\r\n\r\nThe dogs continued to tear and worry the fallen foe, as though\r\nunwilling to trust the appearance of death. With feelings somewhat\r\nakin, I drew my hunting-knife, and made assurance doubly sure.\r\n\r\nSeeing all safe, Jack raised a shout of victory, that poor Ernest\r\nmight gain courage to approach the scene of conflict, which at last he\r\ndid, and joined us in examining the dangerous animals, as they lay\r\nmotionless before us.\r\n\r\nEvery point was full of interest, their wounds, their sharp teeth,\r\ntheir mighty claws, the extraordinary strength of neck and shoulder,\r\nall were remarked and commented on, and observing that the shaded brown\r\nhair was tipped with glossy white, I thought that these might be the\r\nsilver bears* mentioned in Captain Clarke's journey to the north-west\r\ncoasts of America.\r\n\r\n   * Grizzlies, not polar bears\r\n\r\n`Well, my lads,' said I, `if we have failed to catch sight of\r\nserpents, we have at least made good riddance of some other bad\r\nrubbish! These fellows would one day have worked us woe, or I am much\r\nmistaken. What's to be done next?'\r\n\r\n`Why, skin them, to be sure,' said Fritz. `We shall have a couple of\r\nsplendid bear-skin rugs.'\r\n\r\nAs this process would take time and evening drew on, we dragged the\r\nhuge carcases into their den, to await our return, concealing them with\r\nboughs of trees and fencing the entrance as well as we could. The\r\nostrich eggs we also left behind us, hidden in a sandy hole.\r\n\r\nBy sunset we reached the tent, and joyfully rejoined my wife and\r\nFranz, right glad to find a hearty meal prepared for us, as well as a\r\nlarge heap of brushwood for the watch-fire.\r\n\r\nWhen a full account of our adventures had been given, with a minute and\r\nspecial description of the bear-fight, my wife related what she had\r\ndone during our absence. She and Franz had made their way through the\r\nwood up to the rocks behind it, and discovered a bed of pure white\r\nclay, which it seemed to her might be used for making porcelain. Then\r\nshe had contrived a drinking-trough for the cattle out of a split\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\nShe had arranged a hearth in a sheltered place by building up large\r\nstones, cemented with the white clay; and, finally, she had cut a\r\nquantity of canes and brought them, on the cart, to be in readiness for\r\nthe building we had in hand.\r\n\r\nI praised the thoughtful diligence which had effected so much that was\r\nof real and definite use. In order to try the clay I put some balls of\r\nit in the fire now kindled to burn during the night, and we then betook\r\nourselves to rest under shelter of our tent.\r\n\r\nI awoke at dawn and aroused my little party. My first idea was to\r\nexamine the clay balls, which I found baked hard and finely glazed, but\r\ntoo much melted down by the heat--a fault which, seeing the excellent\r\nquality of the clay, I knew it would be well worthwhile to remedy.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, and our accustomed devotions, we harnessed the cart,\r\nand took the way to the bears' den. Fritz headed the party, and, coming\r\nin sight of the entrance to the cave, called out softly:\r\n\r\n`Make haste and you will see a whole crowd of wild turkeys, who seem to\r\nhave come to attend the funeral obsequies of their respected friend and\r\nneighbour, Bruin, here. But there appears to be a jealous watcher who\r\nis unwilling to admit the visitors to the bed of state!'\r\n\r\nThe Watcher, as Fritz called him, was an immensely large bird, with a\r\nsort of comb on his head, and a loose fleshy skin hanging from beneath\r\nthe beak. Part of the neck was bare, wrinkled and purplish-red, while\r\naround it, resting on the shoulders, was a downy collar of soft white\r\nfeathers. The plumage was greyish-brown, marked here and there with\r\nwhite patches; the feet appeared to be armed with strong claws. This\r\ngreat bird guarded the entrance to the cave, occasionally retiring into\r\nit himself for a few minutes; but as soon as the other birds came\r\npressing in after him, he hurried out again and they were forced to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nWe stopped to observe this curious scene, and were startled suddenly by\r\na mighty rush of wings in the air above us. We looked up; at the same\r\nmoment Fritz fired, and an enormous bird fell heavily head foremost on\r\nthe rocks, by which its neck was broken, while blood flowed from a\r\nwound in the breast.\r\n\r\nWe had been holding back the dogs, but they, with Fritz, now rushed\r\ntowards the cave, the birds rising around them and departing with heavy\r\nungainly flight, leaving only Fritz's prize, and one of the other\r\nbirds, killed by the large one in its fall.\r\n\r\nWith the utmost caution I entered the cave, and rejoiced to find that\r\nthe tongue and eyes only of the bears had been devoured: a little later\r\nand we should have had the handsome skins pecked and torn to rags, and\r\nall chance of steaks and bears'-paws gone.\r\n\r\nOn measuring the wings of the large bird from tip to tip, I found the\r\nlength exceeded eleven feet, and concluded it to be a condor; it was\r\nevidently the mate of the `Watcher', as Fritz called the first we saw.\r\n\r\nTo work we now went on the bears, and no slight affair we found it to\r\nskin and cut them up, but by dint of perseverance we at last succeeded\r\nin our object.\r\n\r\nDetermining to smoke the meat on the spot, we cut magnificent hams, and\r\ntook off the rest of the meat in slices after the manner of the\r\nbuccaneers in the West Indies, preserving the paws entire to be cooked\r\nas a delicacy, and obtaining from the two bears together a prodigious\r\nsupply of lard, which my wife gladly undertook to melt and prepare for\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nThe bones and offal we drew to some distance with the help of our\r\ncattle, and made the birds of the air most welcome to feast upon it.\r\nThis, with the assistance of all sorts of insects, they did so\r\neffectually that before we left the place the skulls were picked\r\nperfectly clean, the sun had dried them, and they were ready for us to\r\ncarry off to our museum.\r\n\r\nThe skins had to be very carefully scraped, washed, salted, cleansed\r\nwith ashes and dried, which occupied fully two days.\r\n\r\nI was lamenting our distance from the rascusara* tree, the leaves of\r\nwhich had flavoured our roast peccary so nicely, when I observed among\r\nthe brushwood which the boys had brought from the thickets around us, a\r\nclimbing plant, whose leaves had a very strong smell; the stem\r\nresembled a vine, and the fruit grew in clusters like currants. Some\r\nwere red, and some of a green colour, which I supposed to denote\r\nvarious degrees of ripeness. They were hard, and the outer skin was\r\nquite thin. I recognized in this the pepper plant, a discovery\r\nparticularly agreeable at this moment.\r\n\r\n    * Previously he called it ravensara.\r\n\r\nThe boys soon gathered a large supply; the red berries were soaked in\r\nsalt and water for several days, then washed and rubbed, and finally,\r\nbecoming perfectly white, were dried in the sun. The treatment of the\r\ngreen berries was simple; they were merely exposed to the sun's heat\r\nfor a day or two, and then stored: in this way we obtained enough, both\r\nof black and white pepper, to last us a very long time.\r\n\r\nI took also a number of young plants, that we might have pepper\r\ngrowing at Rockburg and our various settlements. Some roots of another\r\nplant were also taken, which, from the pods, appeared to be a kind of\r\nbean.\r\n\r\nWe were glad of this occupation during the tedious business of smoking\r\nthe bears' meat, and availed ourselves of the leisure time by also\r\npreparing for stuffing the condor and the turkey buzzard, urubu or\r\nblack vulture--for I could not determine to which species the smaller\r\nbird belonged.\r\n\r\nThe four boys at length became so weary of inaction, that I determined\r\nto let them make an excursion alone on the savannah.\r\n\r\nThree of them received this permission with eager delight, but Ernest\r\nsaid he would prefer to remain with us; to which, as the expedition was\r\nto be entirely one of pleasure, I could make no objection.\r\n\r\nLittle Franz, on the other hand, whom I would willingly have kept with\r\nus, was wild to go with his brothers, and I was obliged to consent, as\r\nI had made the proposal open to all, and could not draw back.\r\n\r\nIn the highest spirits they ran to bring their steeds (as we were fain\r\nto call the cattle they rode) from their pasturage at a short distance.\r\nSpeedily were they saddled, bridled and mounted--the three lads were\r\nready to be off.\r\n\r\nIt was my wish that our sons should cultivate a habit of bold\r\nindependence, for well I knew that it might be the will of God to\r\ndeprive them easily of their parents; when, without an enterprising\r\nspirit of self-reliance, their position would be truly miserable.\r\n\r\nMy gallant Fritz possessed this desirable quality in no small degree,\r\nand to him I committed the care of his young brothers, charging them to\r\nlook up to and obey him as their leader.\r\n\r\nThey were well armed, well mounted, had a couple of good dogs; and,\r\nwith a hearty `God speed and bless you, my boys!' I let them depart.\r\n\r\nWe who remained behind passed the day in a variety of useful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nThe bears' meat, which was being cured in a smoking-shed such as that\r\nwe set up for the peccary hams, required a good deal of attention from\r\nmy wife. Ernest had a fancy for making ornamental cups from the ostrich\r\neggs, while I investigated the interior of the cave.\r\n\r\nI found the inner wall to consist of a kind of talc, mingled with\r\nthreads of asbestos, and also indications of mica. Examining further, I\r\ndetached a large block, and found to my joy that I could split it into\r\nclear transparent sheets, which would serve admirably for window panes.\r\n\r\nMy wife saw this substitute for glass with unfeigned satisfaction,\r\ndeclaring, that although she would not complain, yet the want of glass\r\nfor windows had been a downright trouble to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nAs evening approached, the bears' paws, which were stewing for supper,\r\nsent forth savoury odours; and we sat talking round the fire, while\r\nlistening anxiously for sounds heralding the return of our young\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\nAt last the tramp and beat of hoofs struck our ears; the little troop\r\nappeared, crossing the open ground before us at a sharp trot, and a\r\nshrill ringing cheer greeted us as we rose and went to meet them.\r\n\r\nThey sprang from their saddles, the animals were set at liberty to\r\nrefresh themselves, and the riders eagerly came to exhibit their\r\nacquisitions and give an account of themselves.\r\n\r\nFunny figures they cut! Franz and Jack had each a young kid slung on\r\nhis back, so that the four legs, tied together, stuck out under their\r\nchins.\r\n\r\nFritz's game-bag looked remarkably queer--round lumps, sharp points,\r\nand an occasional movement seemed to indicate a living creature or\r\ncreatures within.\r\n\r\n`Hurrah, for the chase, father!' cried Jack. `Nothing like real\r\nhunting after all. And just to see how Storm and Grumble go along over\r\na grassy plain! It is perfectly splendid! We soon tired out the little\r\nantelopes, and were able to catch them.'\r\n\r\n`Yes, father,' said Franz, `and Fritz has two angora rabbits in his\r\nbag, and we wanted to bring you some honey. Only think! Such a clever\r\nbird--a cuckoo, showed us where it was!'\r\n\r\n`My brothers forget the chief thing,' said Fritz. `We have driven a\r\nlittle herd of antelopes right through the Gap into our territory; and\r\nthere they are, all ready for us to hunt when we like--or to catch and\r\ntame!'\r\n\r\n`Well done!' cried I. `Here is indeed a list of achievements. But to\r\nyour mother and me, the chief thing of all, is God's goodness in\r\nbringing you safe back to us. Now, let us hear the whole story that we\r\nmay have a definite idea of your performances.'\r\n\r\n`We had a splendid ride,' said Fritz, `down Glen Verdant, and away to\r\nthe defile through our Rocky Barrier, and the morning was so cool and\r\nfresh that our steeds galloped along, nearly the whole way, at the top\r\nof their speed. When we had passed through the Gap we moderated our\r\nfurious pace and kept our eyes open on the look-out for game; we then\r\ntrotted slowly to the top of a grassy hill, from whose summit we saw\r\ntwo herds of animals, whether antelopes, goats or gazelles, we did not\r\nknow, grazing by the side of the stream below us.\r\n\r\n`We were about to gallop down and try to get a shot at them, when it\r\nstruck me that it would be wiser to try and drive the whole herd\r\nthrough the Gap into our own domain, where they would be shut up, as it\r\nwere, in a park, free and yet within reach.\r\n\r\n`Down the hill we rode as hard as we could go, formed in a semicircle\r\nbehind the larger herd of magnificent antelopes--and, aided by the dogs,\r\nwith shouts and cries drove them along the stream towards the Gap; as\r\nwe came near the opening they appeared inclined to halt and turn like\r\nsheep about to be driven into the butcher's yard; and it was all we\r\ncould do to prevent them from bolting past us; but, at length, one made\r\na rush at the opening and, the rest following, they were soon all on\r\nthe other side of the frontier and inhabitants of New Switzerland.'\r\n\r\n`Capital,' I said, `capital, my boy! But I don't see what is to make\r\nthem remain inhabitants of our domain, or to prevent them from\r\nreturning through the Gap whenever they feel inclined.'\r\n\r\n`Stop, father,' he replied, `you interrupted me too soon; we thought of\r\nthat possibility too, and provided against it. We stretched a long line\r\nright across the defile and strung on it feathers and rags and all\r\nsorts of other things, which danced and fluttered in the wind, and\r\nlooked so strange that I am perfectly certain that the herd will never\r\nattempt to pass it; in fact, Levaillant, from whom I learnt the trick,\r\nsays in his Voyage au Cap de Bonne Esperance that the Hottentots make\r\nuse of the method for penning in the antelopes they have caught in the\r\nchase.'\r\n\r\n`Well done,' said I, `I am glad to see that you remember what you have\r\nread. The antelopes are welcome to New Switzerland, but, my boy,' I\r\nadded, `I cannot say the same for the rabbits you have there; they\r\nincrease so rapidly that if you establish a colony of the little\r\nwretches your next difficulty will be to get rid of them.'\r\n\r\n`True,' he replied, `but my idea was to place them upon Whale Island,\r\nwhere they would find abundant food, and at the same time in no way\r\ntrouble us. May I not establish a warren there? It would be so useful.\r\nDo you know my eagle caught these pretty little fellows for me? I saw a\r\nnumber of them running about and so unhooded him, and in a few minutes\r\nhe brought me three--one dead, with whose body I rewarded him, and\r\nthese two here, unhurt.'\r\n\r\n`Now, father,' said Jack, interrupting him, `do listen to me and hear\r\nmy story, or else Fritz will begin upon my adventures and tire you out\r\nwith his rigmarole descriptions.'\r\n\r\n`Certainly, Jack,' I said, `I am quite ready to listen to you. First\r\nand foremostly, how did you bring down those beautiful little animals\r\nyou have there?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, we galloped them down. The dogs sniffed about in the grass while\r\nFritz was away after the rabbits, out popped these little fawns and\r\naway they went bounding and skipping, at the rate of thirty miles an\r\nhour, with Storm, Grumble and the dogs at their heels. In about a\r\nquarter of an hour we had left the dogs behind and were close upon our\r\nprey. Down went the little creatures in the grass, and, overcome with\r\nterror and fatigue, were at our mercy. So we shouted to Fritz, and--'\r\n\r\n`My dear boy,' said I, `according to your statement, Fritz must have\r\nbeen seven miles and a half off.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, well, father, perhaps we did not ride for quite a quarter of an\r\nhour, and, of course, I can't say exactly how fast we were going; and\r\nthen, you see, the fawns did not run in a straight line; at any rate\r\nFritz heard us, and he and Franz and I leashed the legs of the pretty\r\ncreatures, and then we mounted again, and presently saw a wretch of a\r\ncuckoo, who led us ever so far out of our course by cuckooing and\r\nmaking faces at us and then hopping away. Franz declared it must be an\r\nenchanted princess, and so I thought I would rid it of its spell; but\r\nFritz stopped me shooting it, and said it was a \"Honey Indicator\", and\r\nthat it was leading us probably to a bees' byke, so we spared its life,\r\nand presently, sure enough, it stopped close by a bees' nest in a\r\nhollow tree.\r\n\r\n`This was capital, we thought, and, as we were in a great hurry to\r\ntaste the honey, I threw in a lot of lighted lucifer matches, but\r\nsomehow it did not kill the bees at all, but only made them awfully\r\nangry, and they flew out in a body and stung me all over. I rushed to\r\nStorm and sprang on his back, but, though I galloped away for bare\r\nlife, it was an age before I got rid of the little wretches, and now my\r\nface is in a perfect fever. I think I will get mother to bathe it for\r\nme,' and off rushed the noisy boy, leaving Fritz and me to see to the\r\nfawns and examine the rabbits.\r\n\r\nWith these latter I determined to do as Fritz proposed, namely, to\r\ncolonize Whale Island with them. I was all the more willing to do this\r\nbecause I had been considering the advisability of establishing on that\r\nisland a fortress to which we might retreat in any extreme danger, and\r\nwhere we should be very thankful, in case of such a retreat, to possess\r\nmeans of obtaining a constant supply of animal food.\r\n\r\nHaving ministered to the wants of the antelopes, I tried to interest\r\nthe boys in my discovery of the block of talc, but just then their\r\nmother summoned us to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe principal dish in this meal consisted of the bears' paws--most\r\nsavoury-smelling delicacies, so tempting that their close resemblance\r\nto human hands, and even the roguish `Fee-fo-fum' from Jack, did not\r\nprevent a single member of the family from enjoying them most heartily.\r\n\r\nSupper over, we lit our watch-fire, retired to our tent and slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nWe had been working very diligently; the bears' meat was smoked, the\r\nfat melted down and stored, and a large supply of bamboos collected.\r\nBut I wished to make yet another excursion, and at early dawn I aroused\r\nthe boys.\r\n\r\nFritz mounted the mule, I rode Lightfoot, Jack and Franz took their\r\nusual steeds and, with the two dogs, we galloped off--first to visit\r\nthe euphorbia to collect the gum, and then to discover whether the\r\nostrich had deserted her eggs in the sand.\r\n\r\nErnest watched us depart without the slightest look or sigh of regret,\r\nand returned to the tent to assist his mother and study his books.\r\n\r\nOur steeds carried us down the Green Valley at a rapid rate, and we\r\nfollowed the direction we had pursued on our former expedition. We soon\r\nreached Turtle Marsh, and then, filling our water-flasks, we arrived at\r\nthe rising ground where Fritz discovered the mounted Arabs.\r\n\r\nAs Jack and Franz wanted a gallop, I allowed them to press forward,\r\nwhile Fritz and I visited the euphorbia trees. A quantity of the red\r\ngum had exuded from the incisions I had made, and as this had\r\ncoagulated in the sun, I rolled it into little balls and stored it in a\r\nbamboo jar I had brought with me for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we rode after the boys, who were some way ahead, Fritz remarked,\r\n`Did you not tell me that the juice of that tree was poisonous, father;\r\nwhy have you collected such a quantity?'\r\n\r\n`I did indeed say so,' I replied, `it is a most deadly poison. The\r\ninhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope use it to poison the springs where\r\nwild animals assemble to quench their thirst; and they thus slaughter\r\nan immense number of the creatures for the sake of their hides. I\r\nintend, however, to use it to destroy the apes should they again commit\r\ndepredations, and also in preparing the skins of animals to protect\r\nthem from the attacks of insects.'\r\n\r\nThe two boys were still at some distance from us, when suddenly four\r\nmagnificent ostriches rose from the sand where they had been sitting.\r\n\r\nJack and Franz perceived them, and with a great shout, drove them\r\ntowards us. In front ran a splendid male bird, his feathers of shining\r\nblack, and his great tail plume waving behind. Three females of an\r\nashen grey colour followed him. They approached us with incredible\r\nswiftness, and were within gun-shot before they perceived us. Fritz had\r\nhad the forethought to bind up the beak of his eagle so that, should he\r\nbring down an ostrich, he might be unable to injure it.\r\n\r\nHe now threw up the falcon which, towering upwards, swooped down upon\r\nthe head of the foremost bird, and so confused and alarmed him, that he\r\ncould not defend himself nor continue his flight. So greatly was his\r\nspeed checked that Jack overtook him, and hurling his lasso, enfolded\r\nhis wings and legs in its deadly coils and brought him to the ground.\r\nThe other ostriches were almost out of sight, so leaving them to their\r\nown devices we leaped from our steeds and attempted to approach the\r\ncaptured bird. He struggled fearfully, and kicked with such violence\r\nright and left, that I almost despaired of getting him home alive.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, however, that if we could cover his eyes, his fury\r\nmight be subdued. I instantly acted upon this idea, and flung over his\r\nhead my coat and hunting bag, which effectually shut out the light.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I done this than his struggles ceased, and we were able\r\nto approach. We first secured round his body a broad strip of sealskin,\r\non each side of which I fastened a stout piece of cord, that I might be\r\nable to lead him easily. Then, fastening another cord in a loop round\r\nhis legs that he might be prevented from breaking into a gallop, we\r\nreleased him from the coils of the lasso.\r\n\r\n`Do you know,' said I to the boys, `how the natives of India secure a\r\nnewly captured elephant?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, yes!' said Fritz. `They fasten him between two tame elephants.\r\nWe'll do that to this fine fellow, and tame him double quick.'\r\n\r\n`The only difficulty will be,' remarked Jack, `that we have no tame\r\nostriches. However, I daresay Storm and Grumble will have no objection\r\nto perform their part, and it will puzzle even this great monster to\r\nrun away with them.'\r\n\r\nSo we at once began operations. Storm and Grumble were led up on\r\neither side of the recumbent ostrich, and the cords secured to their\r\ngirths. Jack and Franz, each armed with a stout whip, mounted their\r\nrespective steeds, the wrappers were removed from the bird's eyes, and\r\nwe stood by to watch what would next occur.\r\n\r\nFor some moments after the return of his sight he lay perfectly still,\r\nthen he arose with a bound and, not aware of the cords which hampered\r\nhim, attempted to dash forwards. The thongs were stout, and he was\r\nbrought to his knees. A fruitless struggle ensued, and then at length\r\nseeming to accommodate himself to circumstances, he set off at a sharp\r\ntrot, his guards making the air re-echo with their merry shouts. These\r\ncries stimulated the ostrich to yet further exertions, but he was at\r\nlength brought to a stand by the determined refusal of his four-footed\r\ncompanions to continue such a race across loose sand.\r\n\r\nThe boys having enjoyed the long run, I told them to walk with the\r\nprisoner slowly home, while Fritz and I returned to examine the\r\nostrich's nest. The eggs were quite warm, and I was certain that the\r\nmother had quite recently left the nest; leaving about half, I packed\r\nthe rest of the eggs in a large bag I had brought for the purpose, and\r\nslung it carefully on the saddle before me.\r\n\r\nWe soon caught up our advance guard, and without other notable\r\nincident reached our tent.\r\n\r\nAstonishment and dismay were depicted on the face of my wife as we\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n`My dear husband,' she exclaimed, `do you think our provisions so\r\nabundant that you must scour the deserts to find some great beast to\r\nassist us to devour them? You must discover an iron mine next, for iron\r\nis what ostriches chiefly live on, is it not?\r\n\r\n`Oh! I do wish you would be content with the menagerie you have\r\nalready collected, instead of bringing in a specimen of every beast you\r\ncome across. And this is such a useless monster!'\r\n\r\n`Useless! Mother,' exclaimed Jack, `you would not say so had you seen\r\nhim run; why he will be the fleetest courser in our stables. I am going\r\nto make a saddle and bridle for him, and in future he shall be my only\r\nsteed. Then as for his appetite, father declares it is most delicate,\r\nhe only wants a little fruit and grass, and a few stones and tenpenny\r\nnails to help his digestion.'\r\n\r\nThe way in which Jack assumed the proprietorship of our new prize\r\nseemed to strike his brothers as rather cool, and there was instantly a\r\ncry raised on the subject.\r\n\r\n`Very well,' said Jack, `let us each take possession of the part of the\r\nostrich we captured. Your bird, Fritz, seized the head; keep that;\r\nfather shall have the body, I'll have the legs, and Franz a couple of\r\nfeathers from the tail.'\r\n\r\n`Come, come,' said I, `I think that Jack has a very good right to the\r\nostrich, seeing that he brought it to the ground, and if he succeeds in\r\ntaming it and converting it into a saddle-horse it shall be his. From\r\nthis time, therefore, he is responsible for its training.'\r\n\r\nThe day was now too far advanced to allow us to think of setting out\r\nfor Rockburg, so we fastened up the ostrich between two trees, and\r\ndevoted the remainder of the evening to making preparations for our\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn our picturesque caravan was moving homewards. The\r\nostrich continued so refractory that we were obliged to make him again\r\nmarch between Storm and Grumble, and as these gallant steeds were thus\r\nemployed, the cow was harnessed to the cart, laden with our treasures.\r\nRoom was left in the cart for my wife, Jack and Franz mounted Storm and\r\nGrumble, I rode Lightfoot, and Fritz brought up the rear on Swift.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the Gap we called a halt, and replaced the cord the\r\nboys had strung with ostrich feathers by a stout palisade of bamboos. I\r\nalso took the opportunity of collecting a store of pipe-clay, as I\r\nintended during the winter months, which were close at hand, to try my\r\nhand at china making.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the sugar-cane grove, we again stopped to collect the\r\npeccary hams we had left to be smoked; and my wife begged me to gather\r\nsome seeds of an aromatic plant which grew in the neighbourhood, and\r\nwhich had the scent of vanilla. I obtained a good supply, and we moved\r\nforward towards Woodlands, where we intended to rest for the night,\r\nafter our long and fatiguing march.\r\n\r\nOur tent was pitched, and on our beds of cotton we slept soundly.\r\n\r\nNext morning early we examined our farmyard, which appeared in a most\r\nprosperous and flourishing condition. The sight of all these domestic\r\nanimals made us long even more than ever for our home at Rockburg, and\r\nwe determined to hasten thither with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe number of our pigs, goats and poultry had greatly increased since\r\nwe had last visited our colony; and some of these, two fine broods of\r\nchickens especially, my wife wished to take back with her.\r\n\r\nWe found that the herd of antelopes which Fritz and Jack had driven\r\nthrough the Gap, had taken up their abode in the neighbourhood, and\r\nseveral times we saw the beautiful animals browsing amongst the trees.\r\n\r\nWhile at the farm, we repaired both the animals' stalls, and our\r\ndwelling-room, that the former might be more secure against the\r\nattacks of wild beasts, and the latter fitted for our accommodation\r\nwhen we should visit the spot.\r\n\r\nEverything at length being satisfactorily arranged, we again retired to\r\nrest, and early next morning completed our journey to Rockburg.\r\n\r\nBy midday we were once more settled at home. Windows and doors were\r\nthrown open to admit fresh air; the animals established in their\r\nstalls; and the cart's miscellaneous cargo discharged and arranged.\r\n\r\nAs much time as I could spare, I devoted to the ostrich, whom we\r\nfastened, for the present, between two bamboo posts in front of our\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nI then turned my attention to the eggs we had brought, and which I\r\ndetermined to hatch, if possible by artificial heat. For this purpose I\r\narranged a stove, which I maintained at a uniform temperature, and on\r\nit I placed the eggs carefully wrapped in cotton wool.\r\n\r\nNext morning Fritz and I went off in the boat first to Whale Island,\r\nthere to establish our colonists, the angora rabbits, and then to Shark\r\nIsland, where we placed the dainty little antelopes.\r\n\r\nHaving made them happy with their liberty and abundance of food, we\r\nreturned as quickly as possible to cure the bears' skins, and add the\r\nprovisions we had brought to the stores lying in our cellar.\r\n\r\nAs we returned, we caught up Jack, making his way in great glee\r\ntowards Rockburg. He was carrying, in a basket, an immense eel, which\r\nhe and Ernest had secured.\r\n\r\nErnest had set, on the previous night, a couple of lines; one had been\r\ndragged away, but on the other they found this splendid fellow.\r\n\r\nIt proved delicious. Half was prepared for dinner, and the other half\r\nsalted and stowed away.\r\n\r\nWe now, for a short time, again turned our attention to our duties\r\nabout the house.\r\n\r\nThinking that the verandah would be greatly improved by some creepers,\r\nI sowed round the foot of each bamboo pillar, vanilla, and pepper-seed,\r\nas well as that of other creeping plants, which would not only give the\r\nhouse a pleasanter aspect, but also afford us shade during the summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nI constructed a couple of hen-coops too, for the hens and their little\r\nchicks which we had brought from Woodlands, for I knew that if I left\r\nthem unprotected, the inquisitive dispositions of Knips and Fangs might\r\ninduce them to make anatomical experiments which would be detrimental\r\nto the welfare of the youngsters.\r\n\r\nErnest's rat-skins were voted a nuisance within doors, and were tied\r\ntogether and hung up outside; so powerful was the odour they emitted,\r\nthat even then Jack would pretend to faint every time he passed near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe museum received its additions: the condor and vulture were placed\r\nthere, to be stuffed when we should find time during the rainy season.\r\nThe mica and asbestos, too, were brought in for the present, not to lie\r\nthere idle, but to wait until I could use them as I intended, for china\r\nand lamp-wicks.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied two days in this way, we turned our attention to other\r\nduties: the cultivation of a wheat, barley and maize field, the\r\nmanagement of the ostrich's eggs, and the taming of the captives.\r\n\r\nAs agriculture was, though the least to our taste, the most important\r\nof these several duties, we set about it first. The animals drew the\r\nplough, but the digging and hoeing taxed our powers of endurance to the\r\nutmost.\r\n\r\nWe worked two hours in the morning and two in the evening. Fully did we\r\nrealize the words of Scripture: `In the sweat of thy face shalt thou\r\neat bread.'\r\n\r\nIn the interval we devoted our attention to the ostrich. But our\r\nefforts on behalf of his education seemed all in vain. He appeared as\r\nuntameable as ever. I determined, therefore, to adopt the plan which\r\nhad subdued the refractory eagle.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the tobacco fumes almost alarmed me. The ostrich sank to\r\nthe ground and lay motionless. Slowly, at length, he arose, and paced\r\nup and down between the bamboo posts. He was subdued, but to my dismay\r\nresolutely refused all food. I feared he would die; for three days he\r\npined, growing weaker and weaker each day.\r\n\r\n`Food he must have!' cried I. `Food he must have!'\r\n\r\nMy wife determined to attempt an experiment. She prepared balls of\r\nmaize flour, mixed with butter. One of these she placed within the\r\nbird's beak. He swallowed it, and stretched out his long neck, looking\r\ninquiringly for a second mouthful. A second, third, and fourth ball\r\nfollowed the first. His appetite returned, and his strength came again.\r\n\r\nAll the wild nature of the bird had gone, and I saw with delight that\r\nwe might begin his education as soon as we chose. Rice, guavas, maize\r\nand corn he ate readily--`washing it down', as Jack expressed it, with\r\nsmall pebbles, to the great surprise of Franz, to whom I explained that\r\nthe ostrich was merely following the instinct common to all birds; that\r\nhe required these pebbles to digest his food, just as smaller birds\r\nrequire gravel.\r\n\r\nAfter a month of careful training, our captive would trot, gallop, obey\r\nthe sound of our voice, feed from our hand; and, in fact, showed\r\nhimself perfectly docile. Now our ingenuity was taxed to the utmost.\r\nHow were we to saddle and bridle a bird? First, for a bit for his beak.\r\nVague ideas passed through my mind, but every one I was obliged to\r\nreject. A plan at length occurred to me. I recollected the effect of\r\nlight and its absence upon the ostrich, how his movements were checked\r\nby sudden darkness, and how, with the light, power returned to his\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nI immediately constructed a leathern hood, to reach from the neck to\r\nthe beak, cutting holes in it for the eyes and ears. Over the\r\neyes-holes I contrived square flaps or blinkers, which were so\r\narranged with whalebone springs that they closed tightly of\r\nthemselves. The reins were connected with these blinkers, so that the\r\nflaps might be raised or allowed to close at the rider's pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhen both blinkers were open, the ostrich would gallop straight ahead;\r\nclose his right eye and he turned to the left, close his left and he\r\nturned to the right, shut both and he stood stock still.\r\n\r\nI was justly proud of my contrivance, but, before I could really test\r\nits utility, I was obliged to make a saddle. After several failures, I\r\nsucceeded in manufacturing one to my liking and in properly securing\r\nit; it was something like an old-fashioned trooper's saddle, peaked\r\nbefore and behind--for my great fear was lest the boys should fall.\r\nThis curious-looking contrivance I placed upon the shoulders as near\r\nthe neck as possible, and secured it with strong girths round the wings\r\nand across the breast, to avoid all possibility of the saddle slipping\r\ndown the bird's sloping back.\r\n\r\nI soon saw that my plan would succeed, though skill and considerable\r\npractise was necessary in the use of my patent bridle. It was difficult\r\nto remember that to check the courser's speed it was necessary to\r\nslacken rein, and that the tighter the reins were drawn, the faster he\r\nwould fly. We at length, however, all learned to manage Master\r\nHurricane, and the distance between Rockburg and Falconhurst was\r\ntraversed in an almost incredibly short space of time. The marvellous\r\nspeed of the bird again revived the dispute as to the ownership, and I\r\nwas obliged to interfere.\r\n\r\n`Jack shall retain the ostrich,' said I, `for it is most suited to him;\r\nhe is a lighter weight than either of you his elder brothers, and Franz\r\nis not yet strong enough to manage such a fleet courser. But he is so\r\nfar to be considered common property, that all may practise on him\r\noccasionally; and, in a case of necessity, anyone may mount him.'\r\n\r\nOur field-work was by this time over. The land had been ploughed and\r\nsown with wheat, barley, and maize. On the other side of Jackal River\r\nwe had planted potatoes and cassava roots, and all sorts of other seeds\r\nhad been carefully sown.\r\n\r\nWe had not neglected the ostrich's eggs, and one day Fritz introduced\r\nme with great glee to three little ostriches. But alas, the little\r\ncreatures were not destined to enjoy life for long. One died almost as\r\nsoon as it was hatched, and the others, after tottering about on their\r\nstilt-like legs for a few days, followed its example.\r\n\r\nI now found time to turn my attention to the bears' skins, which\r\nrequired preparation before they would be fit for use as leather. They\r\nhad been salted and dried, and now required tanning. I had no tan,\r\nhowever. This was unfortunate; but not to be deterred from my purpose,\r\nI determined to use a mixture of honey and water in its place.\r\n\r\nThe experiment proved successful. When the skins were dried they\r\nremained flexible and free from smell, while the fur was soft and\r\nglossy.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only result of the experiment, for the honey-water\r\nwhich I boiled appeared so clear and tempting, that it struck me that I\r\nmight prepare from it an excellent drink. I put by some of the liquid\r\nbefore making use of it as tan, and reboiled it with nutmeg and\r\ncinnamon. The preparation, which much resembled English mead, was\r\npronounced delicious, and my wife begged me to brew a large supply. As\r\nour cellar was now well stocked with provisions for the winter, and our\r\nother preparations were completed, I was able to turn my attention to\r\ndetails of lesser importance.\r\n\r\nThe boys had been clamouring for hats, and as my success in so many\r\ntrades had surprised me, I agreed to turn hatter for the nonce. With\r\nthe rat-skins and a solution of india-rubber, I produced a kind of\r\nfelt, which I dyed a brilliant red with cochineal, and stretching this\r\non a wooden block I had prepared, I passed over it a hot iron, to\r\nsmooth the nap, and by next morning had the satisfaction of presenting\r\nto my wife a neat little red Swiss cap, to be lined and finished by her\r\nfor one of the boys.\r\n\r\nMy wife admired the production immensely, and lining it with silk,\r\nadded yet more to its gay appearance, by adorning it with ribbons and\r\nostrich feathers, and finally placed it upon the head of little Franz.\r\n\r\nSo delighted was everyone with the hat, that all were eager to be\r\nsimilarly provided, and begged me to manufacture more. I readily\r\nagreed to do so, as soon as they should furnish me with the necessary\r\nmaterials, and advised them to make half a dozen rat-traps, that they\r\nmight secure the water rats with which the stream abounded, and whose\r\nrich glossy fur would serve admirably for felt.\r\n\r\nEvery fifth animal that they brought me I told them should be mine,\r\nthat I might obtain material for a hat for myself and their mother. The\r\nboys at once agreed to this arrangement, and began the manufacture of\r\nthe traps, which were all so made that they should kill the rats at\r\nonce, for I could not bear the idea of animals being tortured or\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus engaged I applied myself to the manufacture of\r\nporcelain. I first cleaned the pipe-clay and talc from all foreign\r\nsubstances, and made them ready to be beaten down with water into a\r\nsoft mass, and then prepared my moulds of gypsum plaster. These\r\npreparations were at length made, and the moulds received a thin layer\r\nof the porcelain material. When this was partly baked, I sprinkled over\r\nit a powder of coloured glass beads which I had crushed, and which\r\nlooked very pretty in patterns upon the transparent porcelain.\r\n\r\nSome of my china vessels cracked with the heat of the stove, some were\r\nvery ill-shaped; but, after many failures, I succeeded in producing a\r\nset of white cups and saucers, a cream-jug, a sugar-basin, and half a\r\ndozen small plates.\r\n\r\nI must allow that my china was far from perfect; the shape of some of\r\nthe vessels was faulty, and none were really transparent;\r\nnevertheless, the general appearance gave great satisfaction, and when\r\nthe plates were filled with rosy and golden fruit resting on green\r\nleaves, and fragrant tea filled the cups, it greatly added to the\r\nappearance of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nScarcely had I completed my pottery, when great black clouds and\r\nterrific storms heralded the approach of another winter. The rainy\r\nseason having set in, we were compelled to give up our daily\r\nexcursions.\r\n\r\nEven in the spacious house which we now occupied, and with our varied\r\nand interesting employments, we yet found the time dragging heavily.\r\nThe spirits of all were depressed, and even occasional rapid rides,\r\nduring a partial cessation of the rain, failed permanently to arouse\r\nthem. Fritz, as well as I, had perceived this, and he said to me:\r\n\r\n`Why, father, should we not make a canoe, something swifter and more\r\nmanageable than those vessels we as yet possess? I often long for a\r\nlight skiff, in which I might skim over the surface of the water.' The\r\nidea delighted all hands, but my wife, who was never happy when we were\r\non the sea, declared that our chances of drowning were, with the\r\npinnace and canoe, already sufficiently great, and that there was not\r\nthe slightest necessity for our adding to these chances by constructing\r\nanother craft which would tempt us out upon the perfidious element.\r\n\r\nHer fears were, however, speedily allayed, for I assured her that the\r\nboat I intended to construct should be no flimsy cockleshell, but as\r\nsafe and stout a craft as ever floated upon the sea. The Greenlander's\r\ncajack I intended to be my model, and I resolved not only to occupy the\r\nchildren, but also to produce a strong and serviceable canoe--a\r\nmasterpiece of art.\r\n\r\nThe boys were interested, and the boat-building was soon in operation.\r\nWe constructed the skeleton of whalebone, using split bamboo canes to\r\nstrengthen the sides and also to form the deck, which extended the\r\nwhole length of the boat, leaving merely a square hole in which the\r\noccupant of the canoe might sit.\r\n\r\nThe work engrossed our attention most entirely, and by the time it was\r\ncomplete the rain had passed away and the glorious sun again shone\r\nbrightly forth.\r\n\r\nOur front door was just wide enough to admit of the egress of our\r\nboat, and we completed her construction in the open air. We quickly\r\ncased the sides and deck with seal-skin, making all the seams\r\nthoroughly watertight with caoutchouc.\r\n\r\nThe cajack was indeed a curious-looking craft, yet so light that she\r\nmight be lifted easily with one hand, and when at length we launched\r\nher she bounded upon the water like an india-rubber ball. Fritz was\r\nunanimously voted her rightful owner, but before his mother would hear\r\nof his entering the frail-looking skiff she declared that she must\r\ncontrive a swimming-dress, so that `should his boat receive a puncture\r\nfrom a sharp rock or the dorsal fin of a fish and collapse, he might\r\nyet have a chance of saving his life'.\r\n\r\nThough I did not consider the cajack quite the soap bubble my wife\r\nimagined it, I yet willingly agreed to assist her in the construction\r\nof the dress.\r\n\r\nThe garment we produced was most curious in appearance, and I must own\r\nthat I doubted its efficiency. It was like a double waistcoat, made of\r\nlinen prepared with a solution of india-rubber, the seams being\r\nlikewise coated with caoutchouc, and the whole rendered perfectly\r\nairtight. We so arranged it that one little hole was left, by means of\r\nwhich air could be forced into the space between the outer covering and\r\nthe lining, and the dress inflated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I perceived with pleasure the rapid vegetation the climate\r\nwas producing. The seeds we had scattered had germinated, and were now\r\npromising magnificent crops. The verandah, too, was looking pleasant\r\nwith its gay and sweet-scented creepers, which were already aspiring to\r\nthe summit of the pillars. The air was full of birds, the earth seemed\r\nteeming with life.\r\n\r\nThe dress was at length completed and Fritz, one fine afternoon,\r\noffered publicly to prove it. We all assembled on the beach, the boy\r\ngravely donned and inflated the garment, and amidst roars of laughter\r\nfrom his brothers, entered the water. Quickly and easily he paddled\r\nhimself across the bay towards Shark Island, whither we followed in one\r\nof our boats.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was most successful, and Ernest, Jack and Franz, in\r\nspite of their laughter at their brother's garment, begged their mother\r\nto make for each of them a similar dress.\r\n\r\nWhile on the island we paid a visit to the colonists whom we had\r\nestablished there the previous autumn. All were well; we could\r\nperceive by the footprints that the antelopes had discovered and made\r\nuse of the shelter we had erected for them, and feeling that we could\r\ndo nothing more we scattered handfuls of maize and salt, and strolled\r\nacross to the other side of the island.\r\n\r\nThe shore was covered with lovely shells, many of which, with\r\nbeautiful pieces of delicate coral, the boys collected for their\r\nmuseum; strewn by the edge of the water too lay a great quantity of\r\nseaweed of various colours, and as the mother declared that much of it\r\nwas of use, the boys assisted her to collect it and store it in the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAs we pulled back to the land I was surprised to see that my wife\r\nchose from among the seaweed a number of curious leaves with edges\r\nnotched like a saw. When we reached home she carefully washed these and\r\ndried them in the oven. There was evidently something mysterious about\r\nthis preparation and my curiosity at length prompted me to make an\r\nattempt to discover the secret.\r\n\r\n`Are these leaves to form a substitute for tobacco?' said I. `Do you so\r\nlong for its refreshing smell?'\r\n\r\nMy wife smiled, for her dislike of tobacco was well known, and she\r\nanswered in the same jocular tone:\r\n\r\n`Do you not think that a mattress stuffed with these leaves would be\r\nvery cool in summer?'\r\n\r\nThe twinkle in her eyes showed me that my curiosity must still remain\r\nunsatisfied, but it nevertheless became greater than ever.\r\n\r\nThe boys and I had one day made a long and fatiguing expedition, and,\r\ntired out, we flung ourselves down in the verandah. As we lay there\r\nresting, we heard the mother's voice:\r\n\r\n`Could any of you enjoy a little jelly?' She presently appeared,\r\nbearing a porcelain dish laden with most lovely transparent jelly. Cut\r\nwith a spoon and laid before us it quivered and glittered in the light.\r\n\r\n`Ambrosia!' exclaimed Fritz, tasting it. It was indeed delicious, and,\r\nstill marvelling from whence my wife could have obtained a dish so\r\nrare, we disposed of all that she had set before us.\r\n\r\n`Aha,' laughed my wife, `is not this an excellent substitute for\r\ntobacco, far more refreshing than the nasty weed itself. Behold the\r\nproduce of my mysterious seaweed.'\r\n\r\n`My dear wife,' exclaimed I, `this dish is indeed a masterpiece of\r\nculinary art, but where had you met with it? What put it into your\r\nhead?'\r\n\r\n`While staying with my Dutch friends at the Cape,' replied she,\r\n\r\n`I often saw it, and at once recognized the leaves on Shark Island.\r\nOnce knowing the secret, the preparation of the dish is extremely\r\nsimple: the leaves are soaked in water, fresh every day, for a week,\r\nand then boiled for a few hours with orange juice, citron and sugar.'\r\n\r\nWe were all delighted with the delicacy, and thanked my wife for it\r\nmost heartily, the boys declaring that they must at once go off again\r\nto the island to collect as many of the leaves as they could find. I\r\nagreed to accompany them, for I wished to examine the plantations we\r\nhad made there.\r\n\r\nAll were flourishing, the palms and mangroves had shot up in a most\r\nmarvellous manner, and many of the seeds which I had cast at random\r\namongst the clefts in the rocks had germinated, and promised to clothe\r\nthe nakedness of the frowning boulders.\r\n\r\nA way up among the rocks too we discovered a bright sparkling spring of\r\ndelicious water, at which, from the footprints around, we saw that the\r\nantelopes must have refreshed themselves.\r\n\r\nFinding everything so satisfactory, we were naturally anxious to\r\ndiscover how our colony and plantations on Whale Island had fared. It\r\nwas evident at a glance that the rabbits had increased, the young and\r\ntender shoots of the trees bore the marks of many greedy mischievous\r\nlittle teeth. The cocoanut palms alone had they spared.\r\n\r\nSuch depredations as these could not be allowed, and with the help of\r\nthe boys I erected round each stem a hedge of prickly thorn, and then\r\nprepared again to embark; before we did so, however, I noticed that\r\nsome of the seaweed had also been gnawed by the rabbits, and wondering\r\nwhat it could have been to tempt them, I collected some of it to\r\nexamine more fully at home.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the whale, too, attracted our attention, for picked\r\nclean by the birds and bleached by sun and rain the bones had been\r\npurified to a most perfect whiteness. Thinking that the joints of the\r\nvertebrae might be made of use, I separated some ten or twelve, and\r\nrolled them down to the boat, and then returned to the shore, towing\r\nthem after us.\r\n\r\nA scheme now occupied my mind for the construction of a crushing\r\nmachine which would prove of the greatest service to us. I knew that to\r\nmake such a machine of stone was far beyond my power, but it had struck\r\nme that the vertebrae of the whale might serve my purpose.\r\n\r\nI determined next morning to look out a tree from which I might cut the\r\nblocks of wood that I should require to raise my crushers.\r\n\r\nMy expedition was destined to be a solitary one, for when I went to the\r\nstables for a horse, I discovered that the boys had gone off by\r\nthemselves with their guns and traps, and had left to me a choice\r\nbetween the bull and buffalo.\r\n\r\nWith Storm, therefore, I was fain to be content. I crossed the bridge,\r\nbut as I reached the cassava field I noticed to my great annoyance that\r\nit had been overrun and laid waste by some mischievous animals. I\r\nexamined the footprints, and seeing that they greatly resembled those\r\nof pigs, determined to follow the trail, and see who these invaders of\r\nour territory would prove to be.\r\n\r\nThe track led me on for some way until I almost lost sight of it near\r\nour old potato field. For some time I hunted backwards and forwards\r\nwithout seeing a sign of the animals; at length a loud barking from\r\nFloss and Bruno, who were with me, announced that they had been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe whole family of our old sow, and she herself, were standing at bay,\r\nshowing their teeth and grunting so savagely, that the dogs feared to\r\napproach them.\r\n\r\nI raised my gun and fired twice amongst the herd: two of the pigs\r\nfell, and the rest fled, followed by the dogs. I picked up the pigs,\r\nand calling back the pursuers, continued my way through the forest.\r\n\r\nA tree suited to my purpose was soon found; I marked it, and returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nErnest, who had remained at home, assisted me to flay the young\r\nporkers, and I handed them over to my wife to prepare for supper; by\r\nwhich time I hoped the other lads would have returned.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening we heard the sounds of trampling hoofs, and\r\npresently Jack appeared, thundering along upon his two-legged steed,\r\nfollowed in the distance by Fritz and Franz. These latter carried upon\r\ntheir cruppers game-bags, the contents of which were speedily\r\ndisplayed: four birds, a kangaroo, twenty musk-rats, a monkey, two\r\nhares and half a dozen beaver rats, were laid before me. Besides these,\r\nFritz threw down, without a word of explanation, a bundle of thistles.\r\n\r\nThe boys seemed almost wild with excitement at the success of their\r\nexpedition, and presently Jack exclaimed:\r\n\r\n`Oh, father, you can't think what grand fun hunting on an ostrich is;\r\nwe flew along like the wind; sometimes I could scarcely breathe, we\r\nwere going at such a rate, and I was obliged to shut my eyes because of\r\nthe terrific rush of air; really, father, you must make me a mask with\r\nglass eyes to ride with, or I shall be blinded one of these fine days.'\r\n\r\n`Indeed!' replied I, `I must do no such thing.' `Why not?' asked he,\r\nwith a look of amazement upon his face.\r\n\r\n`For two reasons: firstly, because I do not consider that I must do\r\nanything that you demand; and, secondly, because I think that you are\r\nvery capable of doing it yourself. However, I must congratulate you\r\nupon your abundant supply of game; you must have indeed worked hard.\r\n\r\n`Yet I wish that you would let me know when you intend starting on such\r\na long expedition as this; you forget that though you yourselves know\r\nthat you are quite safe, and that all is going on well, yet that we at\r\nhome are kept in a constant state of anxiety. Now, off with you, and\r\nlook to your animals, and then you may find supper ready.'\r\n\r\nPresently the boys returned, and we prepared for a most appetizing meal\r\nwhich the mother set before us.\r\n\r\nWhile we were discussing the roast pig, and washing it down with\r\nfragrant mead, Fritz described the day's expedition.\r\n\r\nThey had set their traps near Woodlands, and had there captured the\r\nmusk-rats, attracting them with small carrots, while with other traps,\r\nbaited with fish and earthworms, they had caught several beaver rats,\r\nand a duck-billed platypus. Hunting and fishing had occupied the rest\r\nof the day, and it was with immense pride that Jack displayed the\r\nkangaroo which he had run down with his swift courser.\r\n\r\nContributions to the garden had not been forgotten, and Fritz handed\r\nover to his mother several cuttings from cinnamon and sweet-apple\r\ntrees. Finally, when all the other treasures had been displayed, Fritz\r\nbegged me to examine his thistles which he had gathered, thinking, he\r\nsaid, that it was a plant used in the manufacture of wool.\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly right, for I recognized it at once as the `fuller's\r\nteazle', a plant whose sharp little thorns, which cover the stem and\r\nleaves, are used to raise the nap of cloth. We resolved to be up\r\nbetimes the following morning, that we might attend to the preparation\r\nof the booty, and as I now noticed that the boys were all becoming\r\nextremely drowsy, I closed the day with evening devotions.\r\n\r\nThe number of the creatures we killed rendered the removal of their\r\nskins a matter of no little time and trouble. It was not an agreeable\r\ntask at any time, and when I saw the array of animals the boys had\r\nbrought me to flay, I determined to construct a machine which would\r\nconsiderably lessen the labour.\r\n\r\nAmongst the ship's stores, in the surgeon's chest, I discovered a\r\nlarge syringe. This, with a few alterations, would serve my purpose\r\nadmirably. Within the tube I first fitted a couple of valves, and then,\r\nperforating the stopper, I had in my possession a powerful air pump.\r\nThe boys stared at me in blank amazement when, armed with this\r\ninstrument, I took up the kangaroo, and declared myself ready to\r\ncommence operations.\r\n\r\n`Skin a kangaroo with a squirt?' said they, and a roar of laughter\r\nfollowed the remark.\r\n\r\nI made no reply to the jests which followed, but silently hung the\r\nkangaroo by its hind legs to the branch of a tree. I then made a small\r\nincision in the skin, and inserting the mouth of the syringe forced air\r\nwith all my might between the skin and the body of the animal. By\r\ndegrees the hide of the kangaroo distended, altering the shape of the\r\ncreature entirely.\r\n\r\nStill I worked on, forcing in yet more air until it had become a mere\r\nshapeless mass, and I soon found that the skin was almost entirely\r\nseparated from the carcase. A bold cut down the belly, and a few\r\ntouches here and there where the ligatures still bound the hide to the\r\nbody, and the animal was flayed.\r\n\r\n`What a splendid plan!' cried the boys. `But why should it do it?'\r\n\r\n`For a most simple and natural reason,' I replied. `Do you not know\r\nthat the skin of an animal is attached to its flesh merely by slender\r\nand delicate fibres, and that between these exist thousands of little\r\nbladders or air chambers; by forcing air into these bladders the fibres\r\nare stretched, and at length, elastic as they are, cracked. The skin\r\nhas now nothing to unite it to the body, and, consequently, may be\r\ndrawn off with perfect ease.\r\n\r\n`This scientific fact has been known for many years; the Greenlanders\r\nmake constant use of it; when they have killed a seal or walrus they\r\ndistend the skin that they may tow the animal more easily ashore, and\r\nthen remove its hide at a moment's notice.' The remaining animals were\r\nsubjected to the same treatment, and, to my great joy, in a couple of\r\ndays the skins were all off, and being prepared for use.\r\n\r\nI now summoned the boys to assist me in procuring blocks of wood for my\r\ncrushing machine, and the following day we set forth with saws, ropes,\r\naxes and other tools. We soon reached the tree I had selected for my\r\npurpose, and I began by sending Fritz and Jack up into the tree with\r\naxes to cut off the larger of the high branches so that, when the tree\r\nfell, it might not injure its neighbours.\r\n\r\nThey then descended, and Fritz and I attacked the stem. As the easiest\r\nand most speedy method we used a saw, such as is employed by sawyers in\r\na saw-pit and, Fritz taking one end and I the other, the tree was soon\r\ncut half through. We then adjusted ropes that we might guide its fall,\r\nand again began to cut. It was labourious work, but when I considered\r\nthat the cut was sufficiently deep we took the ropes and pulled with\r\nour united strength. The trunk cracked, swayed, tottered, and fell with\r\na crash.\r\n\r\nThe boughs were speedily lopped off, and the trunk sawed into blocks\r\nfour feet long. To cut down and divide this tree had taken us a couple\r\nof days, and on the third we carted home four large and two small\r\nblocks, and with the vertebrae joints of the whale I, in a very short\r\ntime, completed my machine.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged on this undertaking I had paid little attention to our\r\nfields of grain, and, accordingly, great was my surprise when one\r\nevening the fowls returned, showing most evident indifference to their\r\nevening meal, and with their crops perfectly full. It suddenly struck\r\nme that these birds had come from the direction of our cornfield. I\r\nhurried off to see what damage they had done, and then found to my\r\ngreat joy that the grain was perfectly ripe.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work before us startled my wife. This unexpected\r\nharvest, which added reaping and threshing to the fishing, salting, and\r\npickling already on hand, quite troubled her.\r\n\r\n`Only think,' said she, `of my beloved potatoes and manioc roots! What\r\nis to become of them, I should like to know? It is time to take them\r\nup, and how to manage it, with all this press of work, I can't see.'\r\n\r\n`Don't be downhearted, wife,' said I; `there is no immediate hurry\r\nabout the manioc, and digging potatoes in this fine, light soil is easy\r\nwork compared to what it is in Switzerland, while as to planting more,\r\nthat will not be necessary if we leave the younger plants in the\r\nground. The harvest we must conduct after the Italian fashion, which,\r\nalthough anything but economical, will save time and trouble, and as we\r\nare to have two crops in the year, we need not be too particular.'\r\n\r\nWithout further delay, I commenced leveling a large space of firm\r\nclayey ground to act as a threshing floor; it was well sprinkled with\r\nwater, rolled, beaten, and stamped; as the sun dried the moisture it\r\nwas watered anew, and the treatment continued until it became as\r\nflat, hard, and smooth as a threshing floor need be.\r\n\r\nOur largest wicker basket was then slung between Storm and Grumble; we\r\narmed ourselves with reaping hooks, and went forth to gather in the\r\ncorn in the simplest and most expeditious manner imaginable. I told my\r\nreapers not to concern themselves about the length of the straw, but to\r\ngrasp the corn where it was convenient to them, without stooping; each\r\nwas to wind a stalk around his own handful, and throw it into the\r\nbasket; in this way great labour was saved.\r\n\r\nThe plan pleased the boys immensely, and in a short time the basket had\r\nbeen filled many times, and the field displayed a quantity of tall,\r\nheadless stubble, which perfectly horrified the mother, so extravagant\r\nand untidy did she consider our work.\r\n\r\n`This is dreadful!' cried she; `you have left numbers of ears growing\r\non short stalks, and look at that splendid straw completely wasted! I\r\ndon't approve of your Italian fashion at all.'\r\n\r\n`It is not a bad plan, I can assure you, wife, and the Italians do not\r\nwaste the straw by not cutting it with the grain; having more arable\r\nthan pasture land, they use this high stubble for their cattle, letting\r\nthem feed in it, and eat what grain is left; afterward, allowing the\r\ngrass to grow up among it, they mow all together for winter fodder. And\r\nnow for threshing, also in Italian fashion. We shall find it spares our\r\narms and backs as much in that as in reaping.'\r\n\r\nThe little sheaves were laid in a large circle on the floor, the boys\r\nmounted Storm, Grumble, Lightfoot, and Hurry, starting off at a brisk\r\ntrot, with many a merry jest, and round they went, trampling and\r\nstamping out the grain, while dust and chaff flew in clouds about them.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I were incessantly occupied with hayforks, by means of\r\nwhich we shook up and moved the sheaves over which the threshers rode,\r\nso as to throw them in the track.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the animals took mouthfuls of the tempting food they\r\nwere beating out; we thought they well deserved it, and called to mind\r\nthe command given to the Jews, `Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\r\ntreadeth out the corn.'\r\n\r\nAfter threshing, we proceeded to winnowing: by simply throwing the\r\nthreshed corn with shovels high in the air when the land or sea-breeze\r\nblew strong, the chaff and refuse was carried away by the wind and the\r\ngrain fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations our poultry paid the threshing-floor many\r\nvisits, testifying a lively interest in the success of our labours, and\r\ngobbling up the grain at such a rate that my wife was obliged to keep\r\nthem at a reasonable distance; but I would not have them altogether\r\nstinted in the midst of our plenty. I said, `Let them enjoy themselves;\r\nwhat we lose in grain, we gain in flesh. I anticipate delicious\r\nchicken-pie, roast goose, and boiled turkey!'\r\n\r\nWhen our harvest stores were housed, we found that we had reaped\r\nsixty, eighty, even a hundred-fold what had been sown. Our garner was\r\ntruly filled with all manner of store.\r\n\r\nExpecting a second harvest, we were constrained to prepare the field\r\nfor sowing again, and immediately therefore commenced mowing down the\r\nstubble. While engaged in this, flocks of quails and partridges came to\r\nglean among the scattered ears. We did not secure any great number, but\r\nresolved to be prepared for them next season, and by spreading nets, to\r\ncatch them in large quantities.\r\n\r\nMy wife was satisfied when she saw the straw carried home and stacked;\r\nour crop of maize, which of course had not been threshed like the other\r\ncorn, afforded soft leaves which were used for stuffing mattresses,\r\nwhile the stalks, when burnt, left ashes so rich in alkali as to be\r\nespecially useful.\r\n\r\nI changed the crops sown on the ground to rye, barley and oats, and\r\nhoped they would ripen before the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe shoals of herring made their appearance just as we finished our\r\nagricultural operations. This year we pickled only two barrels of them;\r\nbut we were not so merciful towards the seals, which arrived on the\r\ncoast directly afterwards. We hunted them vigorously, requiring their\r\nskins for many purposes, more especially for the completion of the\r\ncajack. On the little deck of that tiny vessel I had made a kind of\r\nmagazine, in which to store pistols, ammunition, water and provisions,\r\nand this I meant to cover with seal-skin, so as to be quite watertight.\r\nA couple of harpoons furnished with seal bladders were to be suspended\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nAt last came the day when Fritz was to make his trial trip with the\r\ncajack. Completely equipped in swimming costume--trousers, and jacket\r\nand cap--it was most ludicrous to see him cower down in the canoe and\r\npuff and blow till he began to swell like the frog in the fable.\r\n\r\nAll trace of his original figure was speedily lost, and shouts of\r\nlaughter greeted his comical appearance. Even his mother could not\r\nresist a smile, although the dress was her own invention.\r\n\r\nI got the other boat out, that my wife might see we were ready to go to\r\nhis assistance the moment it became necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cajack was launched from a convenient shelving point, and floated\r\nlightly on the sea-green ocean mirror. Fritz with his paddles then\r\nbegan to practise all manner of evolutions: darting along with arrowy\r\nswiftness, wheeling to the right, then to the left; and at last,\r\nflinging himself quite on his side, while his mother uttered a shriek\r\nof terror, he showed that the tiny craft would neither capsize nor\r\nsink. Then, recovering his balance, he sped securely on his further\r\nway.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by our shouts of approbation, he now boldly ventured into\r\nthe strong current of Jackal River, and was rapidly carried out to sea.\r\n\r\nThis being more than I had bargained for, I lost no time in giving\r\nchase in the boat, with Ernest and Jack; my wife, urging us to greater\r\nspeed, and declaring that some accident could not fail to happen to\r\n`that horrid soap-bubble'.\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived outside the bay, at the rocks where formerly lay the\r\nwreck, and gazed in all directions for signs of the runaway.\r\n\r\nAfter a time we saw, at a considerable distance, a faint puff of\r\nsmoke, followed by the crack of a pistol. Upon this we fired a signal\r\nshot, which was presently answered by another, and, steering in the\r\ndirection of the sound, we soon heard the boy's cheery halloo; the\r\ncajack darted from behind a point of land, and we quickly joined\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n`Come to this rocky beach,' cried Fritz, `I have something to show\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nWith blank amazement we beheld a fine well-grown young walrus,\r\nharpooned and quite dead.\r\n\r\n`Did you kill this creature, my dear Fritz?' I exclaimed, looking\r\nround in some anxiety, and half expecting to see a naked savage come to\r\nclaim the prize.\r\n\r\n`To be sure, father! Don't you see my harpoon? Why do you doubt it?'\r\n\r\n`Well, I scarcely know,' replied I, laughing, `but success so speedy,\r\nso unexpected, and so appropriate, to an amateur Greenlander, took me\r\nby surprise. I congratulate you, my boy! But I must tell you that you\r\nhave alarmed us by making this long trip. You should not have gone out\r\nof the bay. I left your mother in grievous trouble.'\r\n\r\n`Indeed, father, I had no idea of passing out of sight, but once in the\r\ncurrent, I was carried along, and could not help myself. Then I came on\r\na herd of walruses, and I did so long to make a prize of one that I\r\nforgot everything else, and made chase after them when beyond the\r\ninfluence of the current, until I got near enough to harpoon this fine\r\nfellow. He swam more slowly, and I struck him a second time; then he\r\nsought refuge among these rocks, and expired. I landed, and scrambled\r\nto where he lay; but I took care to give him the contents of my pistol\r\nbefore going close up, having a salutary recollection of the big\r\nserpent's parting fling at you, Jack.'\r\n\r\n`You ran a very great risk,' said I. `The walrus is an inoffensive\r\ncreature; but when attacked and wounded, it often becomes furious and,\r\nturning upon its pursuer, can destroy, with its long tusks, a strongly\r\nbuilt whale boat. However, thank God for your safety! I value that\r\nabove a thousand such creatures. Now what's to be done with him? He\r\nmust be quite fourteen feet long, although not full grown.'\r\n\r\n`I am very glad you followed me, father,' said Fritz, `but our united\r\nstrength will not move this prodigious weight from among these rocks;\r\nonly do let me carry away the head, with these grand snow-white tusks!\r\nI should so like to fasten it on the prow of the cajack, and name it\r\nthe Sea-horse.'\r\n\r\n`We must certainly carry away the beautiful ivory tusks,' said I, `but\r\nmake haste! The air feels so excessively close and sultry, I think a\r\nstorm is brewing.'\r\n\r\n`But the head! The head! we must have the whole head,' cried Jack,\r\n`just think how splendid it will look on the cajack!'\r\n\r\n`And how splendid it will smell too, when it begins to putrefy,' added\r\nErnest. `What a treat for the steersman!'\r\n\r\n`Oh, we will prepare for that,' said Fritz. `It shall be soaked and\r\ncleaned, and dried till it is as hard as a wooden model; it shall not\r\noffend your delicate nose in the least, Ernest!'\r\n\r\n`I supposed the walrus to be an animal peculiar to the Arctic\r\nregions,' remarked Ernest.\r\n\r\n`And so it is,' I replied, `though they may occasionally be seen\r\nelsewhere; these may have wandered from the Antarctic seas. I know that\r\non the eastern coast of Africa is found a smaller species of walrus\r\ncalled the dugong: it has long incisor teeth, but not tusks; and\r\ncertainly resembles a seal rather than a walrus.'\r\n\r\nWhile thus speaking, we were actively engaged in the decapitation of\r\nthe walrus, and in cutting off long strips of its skin. This took some\r\ntime, as we had not the proper implements, and Fritz remarked, that in\r\nfuture the cajack must be provided with a hunting-knife and a hatchet;\r\nadding that he should like to have a small compass, in a box with a\r\nglass top, fixed in front of the hole where the steersman sits. I saw\r\nthe necessity of this and I promised it should be done.\r\n\r\nOur work being accomplished, we were ready to go, and I proposed to\r\ntake Fritz and the canoe on board our boat, so that we might all arrive\r\ntogether; but I yielded to his earnest wish to return alone as he came;\r\nhe longed to act as our avant-courier, and announce our approach to his\r\nmother; so he was soon skimming away over the surface of the water,\r\nwhile we followed at slower rate.\r\n\r\nBlack clouds meanwhile gathered thick and fast around us, and a\r\ntremendous storm came on. Fritz was out of sight and beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nWe buckled on the swimming belts, and firmly lashed ourselves to the\r\nboat, so that we might not be washed overboard by the towering seas\r\nwhich broke over it.\r\n\r\nThe horizon was shrouded in darkness, fearful gusts of wind lashed the\r\nocean into foam, rain descended in torrents, while livid lightning\r\nglared athwart the gloom. Both my boys faced the danger nobly; and my\r\nfeelings of alarm were mingled with hope on finding how well the boat\r\nbehaved.\r\n\r\nThe tempest swept on its way, and the sky began to clear as suddenly as\r\nit had been overcast; yet the stormy waves continued for a long time to\r\nthreaten our frail bark with destruction, in spite of its buoyancy and\r\nsteadiness.\r\n\r\nYet I never lost hope for ourselves--all my fears were for Fritz; in\r\nfact I gave him up for lost, and my whole agonized heart arose in\r\nprayer for strength to say, `Thy will be done!'\r\n\r\nAt last we rounded the point, and once more entering Safety Bay,\r\nquickly drew near the little harbour.\r\n\r\nWhat was our surprise--our overwhelming delight when there we saw the\r\nmother with Fritz, as well as her little boy, on their knees in prayer\r\nso earnest for our deliverance, that our approach was unperceived,\r\nuntil with cries of joy we attracted their notice.\r\n\r\nThen indeed ensued a happy meeting, and we gave thanks together for the\r\nmercy which had spared our lives.\r\n\r\nReturning joyfully to Rockburg, we changed our drenched garments for\r\nwarm dry clothes; and, seated at a comfortable meal, considered and\r\ndescribed at our ease the perils of the storm.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, the head of the walrus was conveyed to our workshop; where\r\nit underwent such a skilful and thorough process of cleaning, embalming\r\nand drying, that ere long it was actually fixed on the prow of the\r\ncajack, and a most imposing appearance it presented!\r\n\r\nThe strips of hide, when well tanned and prepared, made valuable\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nMuch damage had been done by the late storm. The heavy rain had\r\nflooded all the streams, and injured crops which should have been\r\nhoused and safe before the regular rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over Jackal River was partly broken down, and the water\r\ntanks and pipes all needed repair. So that our time was much occupied\r\nin restoring things to order.\r\n\r\nOn going to work one day near the cascade, we found a great number of\r\ndark-red berries, scattered on the ground; they were about the size of\r\nordinary hazel-nuts, with small leafy coronets at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe boys thought them so inviting, that they tasted them at once, but\r\nangry exclamations and much spitting and spluttering followed the\r\nexperiment; even Knips rejected them, and they would have been cast\r\naside with contempt, had not the smell induced me to examine them. I\r\ndecided that this was the fruit of the clove.\r\n\r\nSome plants were immediately set in the nursery garden, and my wife was\r\npleased to have this excellent spice wherewith to flavour her boiled\r\nrice and other dishes, in lieu of pepper--a very welcome variety to\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\nHaving a good supply of clay, brought from the bed near Falconhurst, I\r\nproposed to use it for making aqueducts; and, observing how much the\r\nrecent rain had promoted the growth of our young corn, I determined to\r\nirrigate the fields with the drainage from our crushing-mill.\r\n\r\nThe fishing season was again successful. Large takes of salmon,\r\nsturgeon and herring rewarded our annual exertions, and our store-room\r\nagain assumed a well-stocked appearance. Much as I wished that we could\r\nobtain a constant supply of these fish fresh, I was obliged to reject\r\nthe naive proposal from Jack, that we should tether a shoal of salmon\r\nby the gills to the bottom of the bay as we had secured the turtles.\r\n\r\nMany quiet uneventful days passed by and I perceived that the boys,\r\nwearied by the routine of farm work at Rockburg, were longing for a\r\ncruise in the yacht or an expedition into the woods, which would\r\nrefresh both mind and body.\r\n\r\n`Father,' said Fritz at length, `we want a quantity of hurdles, and\r\nhave scarcely any more bamboos of which to make them. Had we not better\r\nget a supply from Woodlands? And you said, too, the other day, that you\r\nwished you had some more of the fine clay: we might visit the Gap at\r\nthe same time.'\r\n\r\nI had really no objection to propose; and it was shortly afterwards\r\nsettled that Fritz, Jack, and Franz should start together; and that\r\nErnest, who had no great desire to accompany his brothers, should\r\nremain with his mother and me, and assist in the construction of a\r\nsugar-mill, the erection of which I had long contemplated.\r\n\r\nBefore they started, Fritz begged some bear's meat from his mother, to\r\nmake pemmican.\r\n\r\n`And what may pemmican be?' she asked.\r\n\r\n`It is food carried by the fur-traders of North America on their long\r\njourneys through the wild country they traverse; and consists of bear\r\nor deer's flesh, first cooked and then pounded or ground to powder. It\r\nis very portable, and nourishing.'\r\n\r\nHis mother consented `to humour him', as she said, although without\r\nmuch faith in the value of the preparation; and in the course of two\r\ndays a stock of pemmican, sufficient for a Polar expedition, was\r\nfabricated by our enthusiastic son.\r\n\r\nThey were ready to start, when I observed Jack quietly slip a basket,\r\ncontaining several pigeons, under the packages in the cart.\r\n\r\n`Oh, oh!' thought I, `the little fellow has his doubts about that\r\npemmican, and thinks a tough old pigeon would be preferable.'\r\n\r\nThe weather was exquisite; and, with exhortations to prudence and\r\ncaution from both me and their mother, the three lads started in the\r\nvery highest spirits. Storm and Grumble, as usual, drew the cart, and\r\nwere ridden by Fritz and Franz; while Hurry carried Jack swiftly across\r\nthe bridge in advance of them; followed by Floss and Bruno, barking\r\nat his heels.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-mill occupied us for several days, and was made so much like\r\nour other mills that I need not now describe it.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first day, as we sat resting in the porch at\r\nRockburg, we naturally talked of the absentees, wondering and guessing\r\nwhat they might be about.\r\n\r\nErnest looked rather mysterious, and hinted that he might have news of\r\nthem next morning.\r\n\r\nJust then a bird alighted on the dove-cot, and entered. I could not\r\nsee, in the failing light, whether it was one of our own pigeons or an\r\nintruder. Ernest started up, and said he would see that all was right.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he returned with a scrap of paper in his hand. `News,\r\nfather! The very latest news by pigeon-post, mother!'\r\n\r\n`Well done, boys! What a capital idea!' said I, and taking the note I\r\nread:\r\n\r\n`Dearest parents and Ernest,\r\n\r\n`A brute of a hyaena has killed a ram and two lambs. The dogs seized\r\nit. Franz shot it. It is dead and skinned. The pemmican isn't worth\r\nmuch, but we are all right. Love to all.\r\n\r\n`Fritz\r\n\r\n`Woodlands, 15th instant\r\n\r\n`A true hunter's letter!' laughed I. `But what exciting news. When does\r\nthe next post come in, Ernest?'\r\n\r\n`Tonight, I hope,' said he, while his mother sighed, and doubted the\r\nvalue of such glimpses into the scenes of danger through which her sons\r\nwere passing, declaring she would much rather wait and hear all about\r\nit when she had them safe home again.\r\n\r\nThus the winged letter-carriers kept us informed from day to day of the\r\noutline of adventures which were afterwards more fully described.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the farm at Woodlands, the boys were startled by\r\nhearing, as they thought, human laughter, repeated again and again;\r\nwhile, to their astonishment, the oxen testified the greatest\r\nuneasiness, the dogs growled and drew close to their masters, and the\r\nostrich fairly bolted with Jack into the rice swamp.\r\n\r\nThe laughter continued, and the beasts became unmanageable.\r\n\r\n`Something is very far wrong!' cried Fritz. `I cannot leave the\r\nanimals; but while I unharness them, do you, Franz, take the dogs, and\r\nadvance cautiously to see what is the matter.'\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Franz made his way among the bushes with\r\nhis gun, and closely followed by the dogs; until, through an opening in\r\nthe thicket, he could see, at the distance of about forty paces, an\r\nenormous hyaena, in the most wonderful state of excitement; dancing\r\nround a lamb just killed, and uttering, from time to time, the ghastly\r\nhysterical laughter which had pealed through the forest.\r\n\r\nThe beast kept running backwards and forwards, rising on its hind\r\nlegs, and then rapidly whirling round and round, nodding its head, and\r\ngoing through most frantic and ludicrous antics.\r\n\r\nFranz kept his presence of mind very well; for he watched till,\r\ncalming down, the hyaena began with horrid growls to tear its prey; and\r\nthen, firing steadily both barrels, he broke its foreleg, and wounded\r\nit in the breast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fritz, having unyoked the oxen and secured them to trees,\r\nhurried to his brother's assistance. The dogs and the dying hyaena were\r\nby this time engaged in mortal strife; but the latter, although it\r\nseverely wounded both Floss and Bruno, speedily succumbed, and was dead\r\nwhen the boys reached the spot.\r\n\r\nThey raised a shout of triumph, which guided Jack to the scene of\r\naction; and their first care was for the dogs, whose wounds they\r\ndressed before minutely examining the hyaena. It was as large as a wild\r\nboar; long stiff bristles formed a mane on its neck, its colour was\r\ngrey marked with black, the teeth and jaws were of extraordinary\r\nstrength, the thighs muscular and sinewy, the claws remarkably strong\r\nand sharp altogether. But for his wounds, he would certainly have been\r\nmore than a match for the dogs.\r\n\r\nAfter unloading the cart at the farm, the boys returned for the\r\ncarcase of the tiger-wolf, as it is sometimes called, and occupied\r\nthemselves in skinning it during the remainder of the day, when after\r\ndispatching the carrier-pigeon to Rockburg, they retired to rest on\r\ntheir bearskin rugs, to dream of adventures past and future.\r\n\r\nThe following day they devised no less a scheme than to survey the\r\nshores of Wood Lake, and place marks wherever the surrounding marsh was\r\npracticable and might be crossed either to reach the water or leave it.\r\n\r\nFritz in the cajack, and the boys on shore, carefully examined the\r\nground together; and when they found firm footing to the water's edge,\r\nthe spot was indicated by planting a tall bamboo, bearing on high a\r\nbundle of reeds and branches.\r\n\r\nThey succeeded in capturing three young black swans, after\r\nconsiderable resistance from the old ones. They were afterwards\r\nbrought to Rockburg, and detained as ornaments to Safety Bay.\r\n\r\nPresently a beautiful heron thrust his long neck from among the reeds,\r\nto ascertain what all the noise on the lake was about.\r\n\r\nBefore he could satisfy his curiosity, Fritz unhooded his eagle, and\r\nthough vainly he flapped and struggled, his legs and wings were gently\r\nbut firmly bound, and he had to own himself vanquished, and submit to\r\nthe inspection of his delighted captors.\r\n\r\nIt was their turn to be alarmed next, for a large powerful animal came\r\npuffing with a curious whistling sound through the dense thicket of\r\nreeds, passing close by and sorely discomposing them by its sudden\r\nappearance. It was out of sight immediately, before they could summon\r\nthe dogs, and from their description it must have been a tapir, the\r\ncolour dark brown, and in form resembling a young rhinoceros, but with\r\nno horn on the nose, and the upper lip prolonged into a trunk something\r\nlike that of an elephant on a smaller scale. It is a gentle creature,\r\nbut when attacked becomes a fierce opponent, and can wound dogs\r\ndangerously with its powerful teeth. The tapir can swim and dive with\r\nperfect ease, and abounds in the densely wooded swamps and rivers of\r\ntropical America.\r\n\r\nFritz in his cajack followed for a time the direction in which the\r\ntapir proceeded, but saw no more of it. Meanwhile the other two boys\r\nreturned to the farm by the rice-fields, and there fell in with a flock\r\nof cranes, five or six of which they caught alive, among them two\r\ndemoiselle or Numidian cranes.\r\n\r\nThese birds they shot at with arrows arranged in a skilful and\r\noriginal way, with loops of cord dipped in birdlime attached to them,\r\nso that it often happened that the bird aimed at, was entangled and\r\nbrought down uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe young hunters seemed to have lived very comfortably on peccary ham,\r\ncassava bread and fruit, and plenty of baked potatoes and milk.\r\n\r\nOne trial of the pemmican was sufficient, and it was handed over to the\r\ndogs. Fritz, however, determined again to attempt the manufacture,\r\nknowing its value when properly prepared.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting a supply of rice and cotton, they took their way to\r\nProspect Hill, `and,' said Fritz, as he afterwards vividly described\r\nthe dreadful scene there enacted, `when we entered the pine wood, we\r\nfound it in possession of troops of monkeys, who resolved to make our\r\npassage through it as disagreeable as possible, for they howled and\r\nchattered at us like demons, pelting us as hard as they could with pine\r\ncones.\r\n\r\n`They became so unbearable, that at last we fired a few shots right and\r\nleft among them; several bit the dust, the rest fled, and we continued\r\nour way in peace to Prospect Hill, but only to discover the havoc the\r\nwretches had made there.\r\n\r\n`Would you believe it, father? The pleasant cottage had been overrun\r\nand ruined by apes just as Woodlands last summer! The most dreadful\r\ndirt and disorder met our eyes wherever we turned, and we had hard work\r\nto make the place fit for human habitation; and even then we preferred\r\nthe tent. I felt quite at a loss how to guard the farm for the future;\r\nbut seeing a bottle of the poisonous gum of the euphorbia in the tool\r\nchest, I devised a plan for the destruction of the apes which succeeded\r\nbeyond my expectations.\r\n\r\n`I mixed poison with milk, bruised millet and anything I thought the\r\nmonkeys would eat, and put it in cocoanut shells, which I hung about in\r\nthe trees, high enough to be out of reach of our own animals. The\r\nevening was calm and lovely; the sea murmured in the distance, and the\r\nrising moon shed a beauty over the landscape which we seemed never\r\nbefore to have so admired and enjoyed. The summer night closed around\r\nus in all its solemn stillness, and our deepest feelings were touched;\r\nwhen suddenly the spell was broken by an outburst of the most hideous\r\nand discordant noises.\r\n\r\n`As by one consent, every beast of the forest seemed to arise from its\r\nden, and utter its wild nocturnal cry. Snorting, snarling and shrieking\r\nfilled the woods beneath us.\r\n\r\n`From the hills echoed the mournful howl of jackals, answered by Fangs\r\nin the yard, who was backed up by the barking and yelping of his\r\nfriends Floss and Bruno. Far away beyond the rocky fastnesses of the\r\nGap, sounded unearthly hollow snortings and neighings, reminding one of\r\nthe strange cry of the hippopotamus; above these, occasional deep\r\nmajestic roarings made our hearts quail with the conviction that we\r\nheard the voices of lions and elephants.\r\n\r\n`Overawed and silent, we retired to rest, hoping to forget in sleep the\r\nterrors of the midnight forest; but ere long the most fearful cries in\r\nthe adjoining woods gave notice that the apes were beginning to suffer\r\nfrom the poisoned repast prepared for them.\r\n\r\n`As our dogs could not remain silent amid the uproar and din, we had\r\nnot a wink of sleep until the morning. It was late, therefore, when we\r\nrose, and looked on the awful spectacle presented by the multitude of\r\ndead monkeys and baboons thickly strewn under the trees round the farm.\r\nI shall not tell you how many there were. I can only say I wished I had\r\nnot found the poison, and we made all haste to clear away the dead\r\nbodies and the dangerous food, burying some deep in the earth, and,\r\ncarrying the rest to the shore, we pitched them over the rocks into the\r\nsea. That day we travelled on to the Gap.'\r\n\r\nThe same evening that the boys reached the rocky pass, a\r\nmessenger-pigeon arrived at Rockburg, bearing a note which concluded in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n`The barricade at the Gap is broken down. Everything laid waste as far\r\nas the sugar-brake, where the hut is knocked to pieces, and the fields\r\ntrampled over by huge footmarks. Come to us, father--we are safe, but\r\nfeel we are no match for this unknown danger.'\r\n\r\nI lost not an instant, but saddled Swift, late as it was, in order to\r\nride to the assistance of our boys, desiring Ernest to prepare the\r\nsmall cart, and follow me with his mother at daybreak, bringing\r\neverything we should require for camping out for some days.\r\n\r\nThe bright moonlight favoured my journey, and my arrival at the\r\nGap surprised and delighted the boys who did not expect me till next\r\nday. Early on the following morning I inspected the footprints and\r\nravages of the great unknown. The cane-brake had, without doubt, been\r\nvisited by an elephant. That great animal alone could have left such\r\ntraces and committed such fearful ravages.\r\n\r\nThick posts in the barricade were snapped across like reeds; the trees\r\nin the vicinity, where we planned to build a cool summer-house, were\r\nstripped of leaves and branches to a great height, but the worst\r\nmischief was done among the young sugar-cane plants, which were all\r\neither devoured or trampled down and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that not one elephant, but a troop must have invaded\r\nour grounds. The tracks were very numerous, and the footprints of\r\nvarious sizes; but, to my satisfaction, I saw that they could be traced\r\nnot only from the Gap, but back to it in evidently equal numbers.\r\n\r\nWe did not, therefore, suppose that the mighty animals remained hidden\r\nin the woods of our territory; but concluded that, after this\r\nfreebooting incursion, they had withdrawn to their native wilds, where,\r\nby greatly increasing the strength of our ramparts, we hoped henceforth\r\nto oblige them to remain.\r\n\r\nIn what manner to effect this we laid many plans, during the night of\r\nmy arrival, when, sitting by an enormous watch-fire, I chatted with my\r\nboys, and heard details of their numerous adventures, so interesting\r\nfor them to relate, and for me to hear, that everyone was more disposed\r\nto act sentinel than retire to sleep.\r\n\r\nMy wife and Ernest arrived next day, and she rejoiced to find all\r\nwell, making light of trodden fields and trampled sugar-canes, since\r\nher sons were sound in life and limb.\r\n\r\nA systematic scheme of defence was now elabourated, and the erection of\r\nthe barricade occupied us for at least a month, as it was to be a firm\r\nand durable building, proof against all invasion.\r\n\r\nAs our little tent was unsuited to a long residence of this sort, I\r\nadopted Fritz's idea of a Kamschatkan dwelling and, to his great\r\ndelight, forthwith carried it out.\r\n\r\nInstead of planting four posts, on which to place a platform, we chose\r\nfour trees of equal size, which, in a very suitable place, grew exactly\r\nin a square, twelve or fourteen feet apart. Between these, at about\r\ntwenty feet from the ground, we laid a flooring of beams and bamboo,\r\nsmoothly and strongly planked. From this rose, on all four sides, walls\r\nof cane; the frame of the roof was covered so effectually by large\r\npieces of bark that no rain could penetrate. The staircase to this\r\ntree-cottage was simply a broad plank with bars nailed across it for\r\nsteps. The flooring projected like a balcony in front of the entrance\r\ndoor, and underneath, on the ground, we fitted up sheds for cattle and\r\nfowls.\r\n\r\nVarious ornaments in Chinese or Japanese style were added to the roof\r\nand eaves, and a most convenient, cool and picturesque cottage,\r\noverhung and adorned by the graceful foliage of the trees, was the\r\nresult of our ingenuity.\r\n\r\nI was pleased to find that the various birds taken by the boys during\r\nthis excursion seemed likely to thrive; they were the first inmates of\r\nthe new sheds, and even the black swans and cranes soon became tame and\r\nsociable.\r\n\r\nConstantly roaming through the woods, the children often made new\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nFritz brought one day, after an excursion to the opposite side of the\r\nstream beyond the Gap, a cluster of bananas, and also of cacao-beans,\r\nfrom which chocolate is made.\r\n\r\nThe banana, although valuable and nourishing food for the natives of\r\nthe tropical countries where it grows, is not generally liked by\r\nEuropeans, and probably this variety was even inferior to many others,\r\nfor we found the fruit much like rotten pears, and almost uneatable.\r\n\r\nThe cacao seeds tasted exceedingly bitter, and it seemed wonderful that\r\nby preparation they should produce anything so delicious as chocolate.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who now fancied no manufacture beyond my skill, begged for\r\nplants, seeds, or cuttings to propagate in her nursery garden, already\r\nfancying herself in the enjoyment of chocolate for breakfast, and I\r\npromised to make a cacao plantation near home.\r\n\r\n`Let me have bananas also,' said she, `for we may acquire a taste for\r\nthat celebrated fruit, and, at all events, I am sure I can make it into\r\nan excellent preserve.'\r\n\r\nThe day before our return to Rockburg, Fritz went again to the inland\r\nregion beyond the river to obtain a large supply of young\r\nbanana-plants, and the cacao-fruit. He took the cajack, and a bundle of\r\nreeds to float behind him as a raft to carry the fruit, plants, and\r\nanything else he might wish to bring back.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he made his appearance, coming swiftly down stream. His\r\nbrothers rushed to meet him, each eager to see and help to land his\r\ncargo. Ernest and Fritz were quickly running up the bank, with arms\r\nfull of plants, branches and fruit, when Fritz handed to Jack a\r\ndripping wet bag which he had brought along partly under water. A\r\ncurious pattering noise proceeded from this bag, but they kept the\r\ncontents a secret for the present, Jack running with it behind a bush\r\nbefore peeping in, and I could just hear him exclaim:\r\n\r\n`Hullo! I say, what monsters they are! It's enough to make a fellow's\r\nflesh creep to look at them!'\r\n\r\nWith that he hastily shut up the bag, and put it away safely out of\r\nsight in water.\r\n\r\nSecuring the cajack, Fritz sprang towards us, his handsome face\r\nradiant with pleasure, as he exhibited a beautiful water-fowl. Its\r\nplumage was rich purple, changing on the back to dark green; the legs,\r\nfeet and a mark above the bill, bright red. This lovely bird I\r\nconcluded to be the Sultan cock described by Buffon, and as it was\r\ngentle, we gladly received it among our domestic pets.\r\n\r\nFritz gave a stirring account of his exploring trip, having made his\r\nway far up the river, between fertile plains and majestic forests of\r\nlofty trees, where the cries of vast numbers of birds, parrots,\r\npeacocks, guinea-fowls and hundreds unknown to him, quite bewildered\r\nhim and made him feel giddy.\r\n\r\n`It was in the Buffalo Swamp,' continued he, `that I saw the splendid\r\nbirds you call Sultan cocks, and I set my heart on catching one alive,\r\nwhich, as they seemed to have little fear of my approach, I managed by\r\nmeans of a wire snare. Farther on I saw a grove of mimosa trees, among\r\nwhich huge dark masses were moving in a deliberate way. Guess what they\r\nwere!'\r\n\r\n`Savages?' asked Franz timidly.\r\n\r\n`Black bears, I bet!' cried Jack.\r\n\r\n`Your words suggest to my mind the manner and appearance of\r\nelephants,' said Ernest.\r\n\r\n`Right you are, Professor!' exclaimed Fritz gaily, the words producing\r\nquite a sensation on the whole attentive family. `From fifteen to\r\ntwenty elephants were feeding peacefully on the leafy boughs, tearing\r\ndown branches with their trunks and shoving them into their mouths with\r\none jerk, or bathing in the deep waters of the marsh for refreshment in\r\nthe great heat. You cannot imagine the wild grandeur of the scene! The\r\nriver being very broad, I felt safe from wild animals, and more than\r\nonce saw splendid jaguars crouched on the banks, their glossy skin\r\nglancing in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n`While considering if it would be simply foolhardy to try a shot at one\r\nof these creatures, I was suddenly convinced that discretion is the\r\nbetter part of valour, and urging my canoe into the centre current,\r\nmade a rapid retreat down the river. For just before me, in the calm\r\ndeep water of a sheltered bay where I was quietly floating, there arose\r\na violent boiling, bubbling commotion, and for an instant I thought a\r\nhot spring was going to burst forth--instead of that, up rose the\r\nhideous head and gaping jaws of a hippopotamus, who, with a hoarse\r\nterrific snort, seemed about to attack me.\r\n\r\n`I can tell you I did not wait to see the rest of him! A glimpse of his\r\nenormous mouth and its array of white gleaming tusks was quite enough.\r\n\"Right about face!\" said I to myself, and shot down the stream like an\r\narrow, never pausing till a bend in the river brought me within sight\r\nof the Gap, where I once more felt safe, and joyfully made my way back\r\nto you all.'\r\n\r\nThis narrative was of thrilling interest to us, proving the existence\r\nof tribes of the most formidable animals beyond the rocky barrier which\r\ndefended, in so providential a manner, the small and fertile territory\r\non which our lot was cast.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the adventurer we had been busily engaged in\r\nmaking preparations for our departure--and everything was packed up and\r\nready by the morning after his return.\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation I yielded to his great wish, which was to return\r\nby sea in his cajack round Cape Disappointment and so meet us at\r\nRockburg.\r\n\r\nHe was much interested in examining the outlines of the coast, and the\r\nrugged precipices of the Cape. These were tenanted by vast flocks of\r\nsea-fowl and birds of prey; while many varieties of shrubs and plants,\r\nhitherto unknown to us, grew in the clefts and crevices of the rocks,\r\nsome of them diffusing a strong aromatic odour. Among the specimens he\r\nbrought I recognized the caper plant and, with still greater pleasure,\r\na shrub which was, I felt sure, the tea-plant of China--it bore very\r\npretty white flowers and the leaves resembled myrtle.\r\n\r\nOur land journey was effected without accident or adventure of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nJack, mounted as usual on Hurry, the ostrich, carried the mysterious\r\nwet bag very carefully slung at his side, and when near home started\r\noff at a prodigious rate in advance of us.\r\n\r\nHe let fall the drawbridge, and we saw no more of him until, on\r\nreaching Rockburg, he appeared leisurely returning from the swamp,\r\nwhere apparently he had gone to deposit his `moist secret', as Franz\r\ncalled it.\r\n\r\nWe were all glad to take up our quarters once more in our large and\r\nconvenient dwelling, and my first business was to provide for the great\r\nnumber of birds we now had on our hands, by establishing them in\r\nsuitable localities, it being impossible to maintain them all in the\r\npoultry-yard. Some were, therefore, taken to the islands; and the black\r\nswans, the heron, the graceful demoiselle cranes, and our latest\r\nacquisition, the splendid Sultan cock, soon became perfectly at home in\r\nthe swamp, greatly adding to the interest of the neighbourhood of\r\nSafety Bay.\r\n\r\nThe old bustards were the tamest of all our feathered pets, and never\r\nmore so than at meal-times. They were unfailing in their attendance\r\nwhen we dined or supped in the open air.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, as we sat in the verandah listening to Fritz's\r\naccount of his trip round the Cape, an extraordinary hollow roaring\r\nnoise sounded from the swamp, not unlike the angry bellowing of a bull.\r\n\r\nThe dogs barked and the family rose in excitement; but remarked a look\r\nof quiet humour in Fritz's eye, as he stood leaning against one of the\r\nverandah pillars, watching Jack, who, in some confusion, started off\r\ntowards the marsh.\r\n\r\n`Come back, you silly boy!' cried his mother. `The child has not so\r\nmuch as a pistol, and is rushing off alone to face he knows not what!'\r\n\r\n`Perhaps,' said I, looking at Fritz, `this is not a case requiring the\r\nuse of firearms. It may be only the booming of a bittern which we\r\nhear.'\r\n\r\n`You need not be uneasy, mother,' said Fritz. `Jack knows what he is\r\nabout, only this charming serenade took him by surprise, and I fancy he\r\nwill have to exhibit his treasures before they reach perfection. Yes,\r\nhere he comes!'\r\n\r\nLugging his `moist secret' along with him, Jack, flushed and\r\nbreathless, came up to us, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n`They were to grow as big as rabbits before you saw them! Such a\r\nshame! I never thought they would kick up a row like that. Now for\r\nit!'--and he turned out the bag. `This is \"Grace\", and this is\r\n\"Beauty\".'\r\n\r\nTwo immense frogs rolled clumsily on the ground, and recovering their\r\nfeet, sat squat before us, swelling and buffing with a ludicrous air of\r\ninsulted dignity, while peals of laughter greeted them on all sides.\r\n\r\n`Ladies and gentlemen, these are two very handsome young specimens of\r\nthe famous African bull-frog,' said Jack, pretending to be offended at\r\nthe mingled disgust and amusement occasioned by their appearance; `they\r\nare but half-grown, and I hoped to maintain them in seclusion, until\r\nthey reached full size, when I would have introduced them with proper\r\neclat. But since their talent for music has brought them precociously\r\ninto public notice, I must beg for your kind and indulgent patronage\r\nand--leave to take them back to the swamp.'\r\n\r\nGreat clapping of hands followed Jack's speech.\r\n\r\n`Grace' and `Beauty' were examined, and commented on with much\r\ninterest, and voted decidedly handsome `in their way'.\r\n\r\nTheir general colour was greenish-brown, mottled and spotted with\r\nreddish-brown, and yellow; the sides green and black; the underpart\r\nyellow, mottled with orange. The eyes were positively beautiful, of a\r\nrich chestnut hue, covered with golden white dots, which shone with a\r\nmetallic lustre. The skin of the body was puckered into longitudinal\r\nfolds.\r\n\r\nBy general consent they were remanded to the swamp. Shortly after our\r\nreturn to Rockburg, my wife drew my attention to the somewhat\r\nneglected state of our dear old summer residence at Falconhurst,\r\nbegging me to devote some time to its restoration and embellishment.\r\n\r\nThis I most willingly undertook, and we removed thither, as soon as the\r\nboys had completed the arrangement of the artificial salt-lick to their\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt Falconhurst things were quickly in good order, and we made a great\r\nimprovement by completing the broad terrace supported on the arching\r\nroots of the trees--it was better floored--and rustic pillars and\r\ntrellis-work sustained a bark roof which afforded pleasant shade.\r\n\r\nAfter this was done, I was compelled to consent to a plan long\r\ncherished by Fritz, who wished to construct a watch-tower and mount a\r\ngun on Shark Island. After great exertion, both mental and bodily, this\r\npiece of military engineering was completed; and a flagstaff erected,\r\non which the guard at this outpost could run up a white flag to signal\r\nthe approach of anything harmless from the sea, while a red flag would\r\nbe shown on the least appearance of danger.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the completion of this great work, which occupied us\r\nduring two months, we hoisted the white flag and fired a salute of six\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\n`We spend our years as a tale that is told,' said King David. These\r\nwords recurred to me again and again as I reviewed ten years, of which\r\nthe story lay chronicled in the pages of my journal.\r\n\r\nYear followed year; chapter succeeded chapter; steadily,\r\nimperceptibly, time was passing away.\r\n\r\nThe shade of sadness cast on my mind by retrospect of this kind, was\r\ndispelled by thoughts full of gratitude to God, for the welfare and\r\nhappiness of my beloved family during so long a period. I had cause\r\nespecially to rejoice in seeing our sons advance to manhood\r\nstrengthened by early training for lives of usefulness and activity\r\nwherever their lot might fall.\r\n\r\nAnd my great wish is that young people who read this record of our\r\nlives and adventures, should learn from it how admirably suited is the\r\npeaceful, industrious and pious life of a cheerful and united family,\r\nto the formation of strong, pure and manly character.\r\n\r\nNone take a better place in the great national family, none are\r\nhappier or more beloved than those who go forth from such homes to\r\nfulfil new duties, and to gather fresh interests around them.\r\n\r\nHaving given a detailed account of several years' residence in New\r\nSwitzerland, as we liked to call our dominion, it is needless for me to\r\ncontinue what would exhaust the patience of the most long-suffering, by\r\nrepeating monotonous narratives of exploring parties and hunting\r\nexpeditions, wearisome descriptions of awkward inventions and clumsy\r\nmachines, with an endless record of discoveries, more fit for the pages\r\nof an encyclopaedia, than a book of family history.\r\n\r\nYet before winding up with the concluding events, I may mention some\r\ninteresting facts illustrative of our exact position at the time these\r\ntook place.\r\n\r\nRockburg and Falconhurst continued to be our winter and summer\r\nheadquarters, and improvements were added which made them more and more\r\nconvenient as well as attractive in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe fountains, trellised verandahs and plantations round Rockburg,\r\ncompletely changed the character of the residence which on account of\r\nthe heat and want of vegetation had in former days been so distasteful\r\nto my wife. Flowering creepers overhung the balconies and pillars;\r\nwhile shrubs and trees, both native and European, grew luxuriantly in\r\ngroves of our planting.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, Shark Island, now clothed with graceful palms,\r\nguarded the entrance to Safety Bay, the battery and flagstaff\r\nprominently visible on its crested rock.\r\n\r\nThe swamp, cleared and drained, was now a considerable lake, with just\r\nmarsh and reeds enough beyond it to form good cover for the waterfowl\r\nwhose favourite retreat it was.\r\n\r\nOn its blue waters sailed stately black swans, snow-white geese and\r\nrichly coloured ducks; while out and in among the water-plants and\r\nrushes would appear at intervals glimpses of the brilliant Sultan,\r\nmarsh-fowl, crimson flamingos, soft blue-grey demoiselle cranes, and\r\ncrested heron, all associating in harmony, and with no fear of us,\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nThe giant frogs, Grace and Beauty, delighted Jack by actually\r\nattaining in time to the size of small rabbits; and, perfectly knowing\r\ntheir very appropriate names, would waddle out of the marsh at his\r\ncall, to eat a grasshopper or dainty fly.\r\n\r\nBeneath the spreading trees, and through the aromatic shrubberies, old\r\nHurry, the ostrich, was usually to be seen marching about, with grave\r\nand dignified pace, as though monarch of all he surveyed. Every variety\r\nof beautiful pigeon nested in the rocks and dove-cots, their soft\r\ncooing and glossy plumage making them favourite household pets.\r\n\r\nBy the bridge alone could Rockburg be approached; for higher up the\r\nriver where, near the cascade, it was fordable, a dense and\r\nimpenetrable thicket of orange and lemon trees, Indian figs, prickly\r\npears and all manner of thorn-bearing shrubs, planted by us, now formed\r\na complete barrier.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-warren on Shark Island kept us well supplied with food, as\r\nwell as soft and useful fur; and, as the antelopes did not thrive on\r\nWhale Isle, they also were placed among the shady groves with the\r\nrabbits, and their own island devoted to such work as candle-making,\r\ntanning, wool-cleaning and any other needful but offensive operations.\r\n\r\nThe farm at Woodlands flourished, and our flocks and herds supplied us\r\nwith mutton, beef and veal, while my wife's dairy was almost more than\r\nshe could manage.\r\n\r\nMy boys retained their old love for giving names to the animals. They\r\nhad a beautiful creamy-white cow, called Blanche, and a bull with such\r\na tremendous voice, that he received the name of Stentor. Two fleet\r\nyoung onagers were named Arrow and Dart; and Jack had a descendant of\r\nhis old favourite Fangs, the jackal, which he chose to call Coco,\r\nasserting that no word could be distinguished at a distance without `o'\r\nin it, giving illustrations of his theory till our ears were almost\r\ndeafened.\r\n\r\nExcellent health had been enjoyed by us all during these ten years,\r\nthough my wife occasionally suffered from slight attacks of fever, and\r\nthe boys sometimes met with little accidents.\r\n\r\nThey were all fine handsome fellows: Fritz, now twenty-four, was of\r\nmoderate height, uncommonly strong, active, muscular and\r\nhigh-spirited.\r\n\r\nErnest, two years younger, was tall and slight; in disposition, mild,\r\ncalm and studious; his early faults of indolence and selfishness were\r\nalmost entirely overcome. He possessed refined tastes and great\r\nintellectual power.\r\n\r\nJack, at twenty, strongly resembled Fritz, being about his height,\r\nthough more lightly built, and remarkable rather for active grace and\r\nagility than for muscular strength.\r\n\r\nFranz, a lively youth of seventeen, had some of the qualities of each\r\nof his brothers; he possessed wit and shrewdness, but not the arch\r\ndrollery of Jack.\r\n\r\nAll were honourable, God-fearing young men, dutiful and affectionate to\r\ntheir mother and myself, and warmly attached to each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many years had elapsed in total seclusion, it continued to\r\nbe my strong impression that we should one day be restored to the\r\nsociety of our fellow men.\r\n\r\nBut time, which was bringing our sons to manhood, was also carrying\r\ntheir parents onwards to old age; and anxious, gloomy thoughts relating\r\nto their future, should they be left indeed alone, sometimes oppressed\r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions I would not communicate the sense of depression to my\r\nfamily, but turning in prayer to the Almighty Father, laid my trouble\r\nbefore Him, with never-failing renewal of strength and hope.\r\n\r\nMy elder sons often made expeditions of which we knew nothing until\r\ntheir return after many hours; when any uneasiness I might have felt\r\nwas dissipated by their joyous appearance, and reproof always died away\r\non my lips.\r\n\r\nFritz had been absent one whole day from Rockburg, and not until\r\nevening did we remark that his cajack was gone, and that he must be out\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nAnxious to see him return before nightfall, I went off to Shark Island\r\nwith Ernest and Jack, in order to look out for him from the watch-tower\r\nthere, at the same time hoisting our signal flag, and loading the gun.\r\n\r\nLong we gazed across the expanse of ocean glittering in the level\r\nbeams of the setting sun, and finally discerned a small black speck in\r\nthe distance which, by the telescope, was proved to be the returning\r\nwanderer.\r\n\r\nI remarked that his skiff sailed at a slower rate than usual towards\r\nthe shore. The cannon was fired to let him know that his approach was\r\nobserved, and then we joyfully hurried back to receive him at the\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see, as he drew near, what had delayed his progress. The\r\ncajack towed a large sack, besides being heavily laden. `Welcome,\r\nFritz!' I cried. `Welcome back, wherever you come from and whatever you\r\nbring. You seem to have quite a cargo there!'\r\n\r\n`Yes, and my trip has led to discoveries as well as booty,' answered\r\nhe. `Interesting discoveries which will tempt us again in the same\r\ndirection. Come, boys, let's carry up the things, and while I rest I\r\nwill relate my adventures.'\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible all assembled round him. `I think my absence\r\nwithout leave deserves reproach instead of this warm reception,\r\nfather, and I must apologize for it,' he began, `but ever since I\r\npossessed the cajack it has been my ambition to make a voyage of\r\ndiscovery along the coast, which we have never explored beyond the\r\npoint at which I killed the walrus.\r\n\r\n`In order to be ready to start without delay when a convenient\r\nopportunity offered, I made preparations beforehand, such as\r\nprovisioning my skiff, fixing the compass in front of my seat,\r\narranging conveniently rifle, harpoon, axe, boat-hook and fishing-net.\r\nI also resolved to take with me Pounce, my eagle, and this I always\r\nwill do in future.\r\n\r\n`This morning dawned magnificently; the calm sea, the gentle breeze,\r\nall drew me irresistibly to the fulfilment of my purpose.\r\n\r\n`I left the harbour unperceived, the current quickly bore me out to\r\nsea, and I rounded the point to the left, passing just over the spot\r\nwhere, beneath the waves, lie the guns, cannon balls, ironwork, and all\r\nthat was indestructible about our good old wreck. And would you believe\r\nit? Through the glassy clear water, undisturbed by a ripple, I actually\r\nsaw many such things strewn on the flat rocky bottom.\r\n\r\n`Pursuing my way, I passed among rugged cliffs and rocks which jutted\r\nout from the shore, or rose in rugged masses from the water. Myriads of\r\nsea-fowl inhabited the most inaccessible of these, while on the lower\r\nridges, seals, sea-bears and walruses, were to be seen, some basking\r\nlazily in the sun, some plunging into the water, or emerging awkwardly\r\nfrom it, hoisting their unwieldy bodies up the rocks by means of their\r\ntusks.\r\n\r\n`I must confess to feeling anything but comfortable while going\r\nthrough the places held in possession by these monsters of the deep,\r\nand used every effort to pass quickly and unnoticed. Yet it was more\r\nthan an hour and a half before I got clear of the rocks, cliffs, and\r\nshoals to which they resorted, and neared a high and precipitous cape,\r\nrunning far out to sea. Right opposite to me, in the side of this rocky\r\nwall, was a magnificent archway, forming as it first appeared to me, a\r\nlofty entrance to an immense vaulted cavern. I passed beneath this\r\nnoble portal and examined the interior.\r\n\r\n`It was tenanted by numbers of a small species of swallow, scarcely\r\nlarger than a wren, and the walls were covered by thousands of their\r\nnests. They were rudely built, and their peculiarity was that each\r\nrested on a kind of platform, something like a spoon without the\r\nhandle. I detached a number, and found that they had a curious\r\nappearance, seemingly made of something fibrous and gelatinous, and\r\nmore like a set of sponges, corals, or fungi, than nests of birds. I\r\nhave brought them home in my fishing net.'\r\n\r\n`If we had commercial dealings with the Chinese,' said I, `your\r\ndiscovery would be of value; these are doubtless edible birds' nests.\r\nThe bird is called the esculent swallow, and the trade in this strange\r\narticle of diet is a very large one. The nests are of different value,\r\nbut those which are quite new, and nearly white, are held in such\r\nesteem that they are worth their weight in silver.\r\n\r\n`There are tremendous caverns in Java and other places where, at great\r\nrisk, these nests are procured; the annual weight obtained being\r\nupwards of fifty thousand pounds, and the value more than £200,000.\r\n\r\n`When placed in water and well soaked, they soften and swell, and are\r\nmade into soup of very strengthening and restorative quality.\r\n\r\n`I think you might try your hand on these, mother, just for\r\ncuriosity's sake.'\r\n\r\n`I can't say I fancy the look of the queer things,' said she, `but I\r\ndon't mind trying if they will turn to jelly; though boiling birds'\r\nnests is cookery quite out of my line.'\r\n\r\n`Oh do, mother, let us taste birds' nests as soon as you can, though\r\nthe idea makes me fancy my mouth full of feathers!' laughed Jack.\r\n\r\n`It is really a most curious formation,' said Fritz. `From whence are\r\nthe swallows supposed to get this kind of gelatine?'\r\n\r\n`It has never been exactly ascertained,' I replied, `whether the birds\r\ndiscover or produce this curious substance. But whatever may be its\r\nbasis, it is clear that a very large portion of it is furnished by\r\ncertain glands, which pour out a viscid secretion.'\r\n\r\n`After laying in my store of nests,' continued Fritz, `I pursued my way\r\nthrough this vaulted cave or corridor; which, presently turning, opened\r\ninto a very lonely bay, so calm and lake-like, that, although of\r\nconsiderable size, I concluded at once it must be nearly land-locked.\r\nIts shores, beyond the rocky boundary through which I penetrated,\r\nextended in a fertile plain towards what seemed the mouth of a river,\r\nbeyond which lay rough and probably marshy ground, and a dense forest\r\nof cedars, which closed the view.\r\n\r\n`The water beneath me was clear as crystal; and, gazing into its\r\ndepths and shallows, I perceived beds of shellfish, like large\r\noysters, attached to the rocks and to each other by tufts of hairy\r\nfilaments.\r\n\r\n`\"If these are oysters,\" thought I, \"they must be better worth eating,\r\nas far as size goes, than our little friends in Safety Bay,\" and\r\nthereupon I hooked up several clusters with my boat-hook, and landing\r\nsoon after on the beach, I flung them on the sand, resolving to fetch\r\nanother load, and then tow them after me in the fishing-net.\r\n\r\n`The hot sun disagreed with their constitution, I suppose; for when I\r\ncame back the shells were all gaping wide open; so I began to examine\r\nthem, thinking that after all they were probably much less delicate\r\nthan the small oysters we have learnt to like so much.\r\n\r\n`Somehow, when a thing is to be \"examined\", one generally needs a\r\nknife. The blade met with resistance here and there in the creature's\r\nbody; and still closer \"examination\" produced from it several pearly\r\nballs, like peas, of different sizes. Do you think they can be pearls?\r\nI have a number here in a box.'\r\n\r\n`Oh, show them to us, Fritz!' cried the boys. `What pretty shining\r\nthings! And how delicately rounded! And how softly they gleam!'\r\n\r\n`You have discovered treasure, indeed!' I exclaimed. `Why these are\r\nmost beautiful pearls! Valueless, certainly, under present\r\ncircumstances; but they may prove a source of wealth, should we ever\r\nagain come into contact with the civilized world. We must visit your\r\npearl-oyster beds at the earliest opportunity.'\r\n\r\n`After resting for some time and refreshing myself with food,' pursued\r\nFritz, `I resumed my survey of the coast, my progress somewhat impeded\r\nby the bag of shellfish, which I drew after me; but I proceeded without\r\naccident past the mouth of the stream to the further side of the bay,\r\nwhich was there enclosed by a point corresponding to that through which\r\nI had entered; and between these headlands I found a line of reefs and\r\nsand-banks, with but a single channel leading out to the open sea; from\r\nwhich, therefore, Pearl Bay, as I named it, lies completely sheltered.\r\n\r\n`The tide was setting strongly in shore, so that I could not then\r\nattempt a passage through it, but examined the crags of the headland,\r\nthinking I might perchance discover a second vaulted archway. I saw\r\nnothing remarkable, however, but thousands of sea-fowl of every sort\r\nand kind, from the gull and sea-swallow to the mighty albatross.\r\n\r\n`My approach was evidently regarded as an invasion and trespass; for\r\nthey regularly beset me, screaming and wheeling over my head, till, out\r\nof all patience, I stood up, and hit furiously about me with the\r\nboat-hook; when, rather to my surprise, one blow struck an albatross\r\nwith such force, that he fell stunned into the water.\r\n\r\n`I now once more attempted to cross the reef by the narrow channel, and\r\nhappily succeeding, found myself in the open sea, and speeding\r\nhomewards, joyfully saw our flag flying, and heard the welcome salute\r\nyou fired.'\r\n\r\nHere ended the narrative; but next morning Fritz drew me aside, and\r\nconfided to me a most remarkable sequel, in these words:\r\n\r\n`There was something very extraordinary about that albatross, father. I\r\nallowed you to suppose that I left it as it fell, but in reality I\r\nraised it to the deck of the canoe, and then perceived a piece of rag\r\nwound round one of its legs. This I removed, and, to my utter\r\nastonishment, saw English words written on it, which I plainly made out\r\nto be \"Save an unfortunate Englishwoman from the smoking rock!\"\r\n\r\n`This little sentence sent a thrill through every nerve: my brain\r\nseemed to whirl. I doubted the evidence of my senses.\r\n\r\n`\"Is this reality, or delusion?\" thought I, \"Can it be true, that a\r\nfellow creature breathes with us the air of this lonely region?\"\r\n\r\n`I felt stupefied for some minutes: the bird began to show signs of\r\nlife, which recalled me to myself; and, quickly deciding what must be\r\ndone, I tore a strip from my handkerchief, on which I traced the words,\r\n\"Do not despair! Help is near!\"\r\n\r\n`This I carefully bound round one leg, replacing the rag on the other,\r\nand then applied myself to the complete restoration of the bird. It\r\ngradually revived; and after drinking a little, surprised me by\r\nsuddenly rising on the wing, faltering a moment in its flight, and then\r\nrapidly disappearing from my view in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\n`Now, father, one thought occupies me continually: will my note ever\r\nreach this Englishwoman? Shall I be able to find, and to save her?' I\r\nlistened to this account with feelings of the liveliest interest and\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n`My dear son,' said I, `you have done wisely in confiding to me alone\r\nyour most exciting discovery. Unless we know more, we must not unsettle\r\nthe others by speaking of it; for it appears to me quite possible that\r\nthese words were penned long ago on some distant shore, where, by this\r\ntime, the unhappy stranger may have perished miserably. By the \"smoking\r\nrock\" must be meant a volcano. There are none here.'\r\n\r\nFritz was not disposed to look at the case from this gloomy point of\r\nview; did not think the rag so very old; believed smoke might rise from\r\na rock which was not volcanic; and evidently cherished the hope that he\r\nmight be able to respond effectually to this touching appeal. I was in\r\nreality as anxious as himself on the subject, but judged it prudent to\r\nabate rather than excite hopes of success which might be doomed to\r\nbitter disappointment.\r\n\r\nAfter earnest consultation on the subject, we decided that Fritz\r\nshould go in search of the writer of the message, but not until he had\r\nso altered the canoe as to fit it for carrying two persons, as well as\r\nprovisions sufficient to admit of his absence for a considerable time.\r\nImpatient as he was, he could not but see the wisdom of this delay. We\r\nreturned to the house, and saw the boys busily opening the oysters,\r\nwhich they had had no time to do the previous night, and greatly\r\nexcited as ever and anon a pearl was found.\r\n\r\n`May we not establish a pearl-fishery at once, father?' shouted they.\r\n`We might build a hut on the shore of the bay and set about it\r\nregularly.'\r\n\r\nAn excursion to Pearl Bay was now the event to which all thoughts\r\nturned, and for which preparations on a grand scale were made. It was\r\nto form, as it were, the basis of the more important voyage Fritz had\r\nin view, and to which, unsuspected by the rest, he could devote all his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI took an opportunity, one day, when all were present, to remark in a\r\nserious tone:\r\n\r\n`I have been considering, dear wife, that our eldest son is now of an\r\nage to be dependent on himself. I shall, therefore, henceforth leave\r\nhim at liberty to act in all respects according to his own judgement;\r\nand, especially in the matter of voyages or excursions, he must not be\r\nhampered by the fear of alarming us should he choose to remain absent\r\nlonger than we expect. I have such entire confidence in his prudence,\r\nand at the same time in his affection for us, that I am certain he will\r\nnever needlessly cause us anxiety.'\r\n\r\nFritz looked gratefully towards me as I spoke; and his mother ratified\r\nmy words, embracing him affectionately, and saying, with emotion, `God\r\nbless and preserve thee, my boy!'\r\n\r\nIt took some time to make several raking or scraping machines, which I\r\ninvented for the purpose of detaching and lifting the oysters from\r\ntheir native rocks; but that gave Fritz leisure to change the fittings\r\nof his canoe, so as to have a spare seat in it.\r\n\r\nHis brothers naturally concluded he meant to take one of them as\r\nshipmate on board, and he allowed the mistake to continue.\r\n\r\nThey occupied themselves in making various articles they expected to be\r\nof use, and bore the delay with tolerable patience.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day, when, taking leave of my wife and Franz, we went\r\non board the yacht, accompanied by some of the dogs; while Jack,\r\nproudly occupying the new seat beside Fritz in the canoe, shared with\r\nhim the honour of leading the way in the character of pilots.\r\n\r\nWe passed safely through the rocks and shoals near Walrus Island into\r\nan expanse of calm water, sheltered by jutting cliffs, where the sea\r\nglanced like a mirror, and for the first time we observed the\r\nfairy-like shells of the paper-nautilus sailing lightly over the\r\ndazzling surface.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to see these lovely seafarers without wishing to\r\nobtain specimens; and the canoe accordingly gave chase, presently\r\nsecuring half a dozen, which were handed to us in the yacht to be\r\ncarefully preserved for the museum, and the place was ever after called\r\nNautilus Creek.\r\n\r\nFurther on we rounded a short promontory, flat, with an abrupt rock at\r\nthe extremity, to which we gave the name of Cape Pug-Nose; and then, at\r\nsome distance, appeared the grand cliffs of a headland running far out\r\nto sea.\r\n\r\nThis I supposed we should have to weather, but my pilots made no\r\nchange in our course, and, following the canoe, we soon came in sight\r\nof the majestic archway which offered us a short passage to Pearl Bay.\r\n\r\nThe wonderfully architectural appearance of the pillars, arches and\r\npinnacles, surrounding and surmounting this noble entrance, struck me\r\nwith admiration, resembling parts of a fine gothic cathedral, and\r\ninducing me to propose for it the name Cape Minster.\r\n\r\nA perfect cloud of little swallows darted from the cavernous entrance\r\non our approach, divided into flocks, soared, wheeled, flew right and\r\nleft, and finally returned in a body as swiftly as they came, to the\r\nsides of the long dark tunnel, which were festooned with their nests.\r\n\r\nWe detached a number of these as we passed, taking care to leave those\r\ncontaining eggs or young. The best were at a considerable height, but\r\nthe broken and shelving rocks afforded, in some places, footing for\r\nsuch daring and active climbers as Fritz and Jack, and they quickly\r\nobtained as many as we could possibly require.\r\n\r\nOur progress was much assisted by the tide, which, like a current, bore\r\nus onward along the nave of this natural cathedral; aisles, transepts,\r\nscreens and side-chapels appearing between the columns and arches which\r\nin the `dim religious light' were revealed to our wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nOn emerging into the dazzling sunshine, we found ourselves floating in\r\nthe calm expanse of Pearl Bay; but it was some minutes before we could\r\nlook around on the bright and lovely scene.\r\n\r\nFritz had not overrated its beauty, and the romantic islets which\r\nstudded its waters seemed to give the effect of a pleasant smile to\r\nfeatures already perfect.\r\n\r\nWe cruised about for some time, surveying the coast with its fertile\r\nmeadows, shady groves, gently swelling hills and murmuring brooks,\r\nseeking a convenient landing-place in the vicinity of the shallows\r\nwhere lay the oyster-beds.\r\n\r\nThis we found, close to a sparkling streamlet; and, as the day was fast\r\ndeclining, we made speedy arrangements for burning a watch-fire; after\r\nwhich we partook of a hasty supper, and leaving the dogs, with Coco,\r\nthe jackal, to sleep on shore, we returned on board the yacht for the\r\nnight, anchoring within gunshot of the land.\r\n\r\nThe coast being quite strange to us, I knew not what wild beasts might\r\nfrequent it; but, though I did not fear that any would approach us by\r\nswimming, yet I was glad to have with us our lively little ape, Mercury\r\n(the successor of our old favourite, Knips, long since gathered to his\r\nfathers), for he occupied at night a cosy berth on deck, and was\r\ncertain to give vociferous notice should anything alarming occur.\r\n\r\nFritz moored the cajack alongside, and came on board. The night passed\r\nin peace, although for a time we were disturbed by the yelping of\r\njackals, with whom Coco persisted in keeping up a noisy conversation.\r\n\r\nWe awoke at daybreak, and after breakfasting a la fourchette*, we\r\nrepaired in haste with nets, scrapers and all other requisites, to the\r\noyster-beds, where we worked with such diligence and success that in\r\nthe course of two days we had an immense pile of shells built up like a\r\nstack on the beach, and left to decay. I collected a quantity of\r\nseaweed to spread over them, which was afterwards burnt to make alkali,\r\nwhen we returned to secure our harvest of pearls.\r\n\r\n   * lit. in the manner of a fork; from a French saying that\r\n     translates \"the fork of Father Adam.\" In other words, they\r\n     ate hastily with their fingers.\r\n\r\nEvery evening we went out shooting in the neighbourhood, and kept\r\nourselves supplied with game of one sort or another. The last day of\r\nour fishery we started earlier, intending to make a longer excursion\r\ninto the woods.\r\n\r\nErnest set off first with Floss; Jack and Coco strolling after them.\r\nFritz and I were still employed in taking on board the last load of our\r\ntools, when we suddenly heard a shot, a loud cry of pain or fear, and\r\nthen another shot.\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm, the other two dogs rushed away from us towards the\r\nspot, and Fritz, who had just called Pounce from his perch, to\r\naccompany us in the ramble, let him fly, and seizing his rifle darted\r\noff in the same direction.\r\n\r\nBefore I could reach the scene of action, more shots were heard, and\r\nthen a shout of victory; after which appeared through the stems of the\r\ntrees the disconsolate figure of Jack, hobbling along like a cripple,\r\nsupported on each side by his brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen they came near me they stopped; and poor Jack, moaning and\r\ngroaning, began to feel himself all over, as if to search for broken\r\nbones, crying out:\r\n\r\n`I'm pounded like a half-crushed pepper-corn!'\r\n\r\nOn examination I found some severe bruises. `Who or what has been\r\npummelling the boy?' I exclaimed. `One would think he had been\r\nbeaten.'\r\n\r\n`It was a huge wild boar,' said Ernest, `with fierce eyes, monstrous\r\ntusks and a snout as broad as my hand.'\r\n\r\nWe took Jack down to the yacht, bathed his bruises, gave him a cooling\r\ndrink, and he soon fell fast asleep in his berth, where I left him and\r\nreturned to the shore.\r\n\r\n`Now, Ernest,' said I, `enlighten me on the subject of this adventure!\r\nWhat you and the boar did, is quite a mystery to me.'\r\n\r\n`Floss and I were going quietly along,' replied he, `when suddenly\r\nthere was a rustling and snorting close by, and a great boar broke\r\nthrough the bushes, making for the outskirts of the wood. Floss gave\r\nchase directly, and the boar turned to bay. Then up came Jack with\r\nCoco, and the gallant little jackal attacked the monster in the rear.\r\nIn another moment, however, he was sent sprawling upon his back, and\r\nthis so provoked his master that he fired a hasty ill-directed shot.\r\nThe brute's notice and fury at once turned upon Jack, who prudently\r\ntook to his heels, while I attempted to check the career of the boar by\r\na shot, which, however, only slightly wounded it.\r\n\r\n`Jack stumbled and fell over the root of a tree, just as the animal\r\ncame up with him. \"Help! Murder,\" shouted he; and if the other dogs had\r\nnot then arrived, and all together tackled the boar, I fear it would\r\nhave been a case of murder indeed! As it was, the poor fellow got\r\nmauled and trampled upon dreadfully.\r\n\r\n`As I was waiting for an opportunity to fire without any risk of\r\nhitting Jack, Pounce rushed through the air and darted upon the beast,\r\nand Fritz came quickly up and shot it dead with a pistol.\r\n\r\n`While we were helping Jack along, and passing a place where the boar\r\nhad been grubbing, I noticed some such curious knotty roots or\r\ntubercles, that I brought away specimens. Are they worth anything, do\r\nyou think? They have a strong smell.'\r\n\r\n`If I may trust my nose,' said I, `you have brought something by no\r\nmeans to be despised. Yes,' I continued, putting them to my lips,\r\n`these are very fine truffles! Taste them, Fritz.'\r\n\r\n`Indeed they are excellent,' said he, `very different from the tough,\r\nleathery things I remember in Europe: these are tender and\r\nwell-flavoured.'\r\n\r\n`Because they are fresh,' said I. `You have before tasted those only\r\nwhich have been brought from a distance.\r\n\r\n`They are found in different parts of Europe, buried at a depth of ten\r\nor twelve inches in the soil of oak or beech woods. A small dog is\r\nemployed to hunt for them, who perceives their musky odour in a\r\nsingularly acute way, and at once scratches at the spot where they\r\nlie.'\r\n\r\n`Have the truffles no leaves or stalks,' inquired Fritz, `by which they\r\nmight be found without the help of the dog?'\r\n\r\n`They have nothing of the sort,' I replied. `They are discovered\r\nsimply by scent, and are considered to belong to the tribe of Fungi.'\r\n\r\nBy this time it was late: we took supper, made up the watch-fire, and\r\nwithdrew to our yacht, where we slept peacefully.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning we proceeded to visit the field of battle. The wild\r\nboar, which I had not before seen, proved to be much larger and more\r\nformidable in appearance than I had imagined, and Jack's escape seemed\r\nto me perfectly marvellous.\r\n\r\nThe boys took it as a matter of course that we were to cut out hams and\r\nflitches; and we therefore did so, though I warned them that they need\r\nnot expect much pleasure in eating bacon from a tough old African boar\r\nlike this. We conveyed the mighty hams to the beach, each on a sledge\r\nof plaited boughs and twigs, and drawn by one of the dogs. The\r\nmonstrous head travelled in the same way, and we collected a large\r\nnumber of truffles before quitting the forest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dogs were released, they rushed back to the scene of\r\noperations in the wood, comprehending that they were now free to feast\r\non what remained there.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to be done in consequence of this affair, that\r\nFritz, who had hoped to set out on his solitary expedition that day,\r\ndeferred it until the next; and was, therefore, fortunately with us,\r\nwhen late in the evening we desisted from our labours, and having\r\nsupped, were preparing to retire to rest. All at once a deep fearful\r\nsound echoed through the neighbouring woods. It made our blood curdle\r\nin our veins. We listened with straining ears, hoping it would not be\r\nrepeated. With a shudder we heard the dread voice roar again, yet\r\nnearer to us, and an answer peal from the distance.\r\n\r\n`We must find out who are the performers in this concert!' exclaimed\r\nFritz, springing to his feet, and snatching up his rifle. `Make the\r\nfire blaze, get on board the yacht, and have all the guns in readiness.\r\nI am off to reconnoitre in the canoe.'\r\n\r\nWe mechanically obeyed his rapid orders, while the bold youth\r\ndisappeared in the darkness; and, after heaping fuel on the fire, we\r\nwent on board and armed ourselves with cutlasses, besides loading all\r\nthe guns, waiting in readiness either to land again, or to quit the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nWe presently saw the whole pack of our dogs, as well as Coco, the\r\njackal, and the little ape, Mercury (who had been tempted by the\r\ntruffles to stay with them in the woods), come galloping at full speed\r\nup to the fire.\r\n\r\nMercury was evidently excessively discomposed at finding us gone; he\r\ngnashed his teeth, and chattered, as though in fear, looking\r\nhopelessly at the water, through which he could not venture.\r\n\r\nThe dogs planted themselves by the fire, gazing fixedly landward, with\r\nears erect, and occasionally uttering a barking challenge, or a\r\nsuppressed howl.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the horrid roarings approached nearer, and I concluded that a\r\ncouple of leopards or panthers had been attracted by the scent of the\r\nboar's carcase.\r\n\r\nBut not long after I had expressed this opinion, we beheld a large\r\npowerful animal spring from the underwood and, with a bound and\r\nmuttered roar, approach the fire. In a moment I recognized the\r\nunmistakable outlines of the form of a lion, though in size he far\r\nsurpassed any I had ever seen exhibited in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe dogs slunk behind the fire, and the lion seated himself almost like\r\na cat on his hind legs, glaring alternately at them, and at the great\r\nboar hams which hung near, with doubtless a mixed feeling of irritation\r\nand appetite, which was testified by the restless movement of his tail.\r\n\r\nHe then arose, and commenced walking up and down with slow and\r\nmeasured pace, occasionally uttering short, angry roars, quite unlike\r\nthe prolonged full tones we had heard at first. At times he went to\r\ndrink at the brook, always returning with such haste, that I fully\r\nexpected to see him spring.\r\n\r\nGradually his manner became more and more threatening; he turned\r\ntowards us, crouched, and with his body at full stretch, waved his\r\ntail, and glared so furiously, that I was in doubt whether to fire or\r\nretreat, when through the darkness rang the sharp crack of a rifle.\r\n\r\n`That is Fritz!' exclaimed everyone; while, with a fearful roar, the\r\nlion sprang to his feet, stood stock still, tottered, sank on his\r\nknees, rolled over, and lay motionless on the sand.\r\n\r\n`We are saved!' I cried. `That was a masterly shot. The lion is struck\r\nto the heart: he will never stir again. Stay on board, boys. I must\r\njoin my brave Fritz.'\r\n\r\nIn a few moments I landed: the dogs met me with evident tokens of\r\npleasure, but kept whining uneasily, and looking towards the deep\r\ndarkness of the woods whence the lion had come.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour made me cautious; and, seeing nothing of Fritz, I\r\nlingered by the boat, when suddenly a lioness bounded from the shadow\r\nof the trees, into the light diffused by the fire.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the blazing faggots she paused, as though startled; passed\r\nwith uncertain step round the outskirts of the illuminated circle; and\r\nuttered roarings, which were evidently calls to her mate, whose dead\r\nbody she presently discovered.\r\n\r\nFinding him motionless, her manner betokened the greatest concern; she\r\ntouched him with her forepaws, smelt round him, and licked his bleeding\r\nwounds. Then raising her head, she gnashed her teeth, and gave forth\r\nthe most lamentable and dreadful sound I ever heard; a mingled roar and\r\nhowl, which was like the expression of grief, rage, and a vow to be\r\nrevenged, all in one.\r\n\r\nCrack! Another shot: the creature's right forepaw was lamed; and the\r\ndogs, seeing me raise my gun, suddenly gathered courage, and ran\r\nforward just as I fired. My shot also wounded the lioness, but not\r\nmortally, and the most terrific combat ensued.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to fire again, for fear of wounding the dogs. The\r\nscene was fearful beyond description. Black night surrounded us; the\r\nfitful blaze of the fire shed a strange, unnatural light on the\r\nprostrate body of the huge dead lion, and on the wounded lioness, who\r\nfought desperately against the attack of the four gallant dogs; while\r\nthe cries, roars and groans of anguish and fury uttered by all the\r\nanimals were enough to try the stoutest nerves.\r\n\r\nOld Juno, staunch to the last, was foremost in the fray. After a time,\r\nI saw her change her plan of attack, and spring at the throat of the\r\nlioness; who, in an instant, raised her left paw, and at one blow the\r\ncruel claws had laid open the body of the dog, and destroyed the life\r\nof the true and faithful companion of so many years.\r\n\r\nJust then, Fritz appeared. The lioness was much weakened, and we\r\nventured to go near enough to fire with safety to ourselves; and\r\nfinally I dispatched her by plunging a hunting-knife deep in her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nErnest and Jack were summoned from the yacht to witness the completed\r\nvictory; and I regretted having left them on board, when I saw how\r\ngreatly the noise and tumult had alarmed them, unable as they were to\r\nascertain what was going on.\r\n\r\nThey hastened towards us in great agitation, and their joy on seeing us\r\nsafe was only equalled by the grief they felt on learning of the death\r\nof Juno.\r\n\r\nThe night was now far advanced; the fire burnt low; but we piled on\r\nmore wood, and, by the renewed light, drew poor Juno from between the\r\npaws of the lioness; and, by the brookside, washed and bound up the\r\ntorn body, wrapping it carefully in canvas, and carrying it with us on\r\nboard the yacht, that it might be buried at Rockburg, whither, on the\r\nfollowing day, it was our purpose to return.\r\n\r\nWearied and sorrowful, but full of thankfulness for our personal\r\nsafety, we at length lay down to sleep, having brought all the dogs on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nNext morning, before quitting Pearl Bay, we once more landed, that we\r\nmight possess ourselves of the magnificent skins of the lion and\r\nlioness, whose visit, fatal to themselves, had caused such a commotion\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nIn about a couple of hours we returned to the yacht, leaving the\r\nflayed carcasses to the tender mercies of the birds of prey sure to be\r\nattracted to them.\r\n\r\n`Homeward bound,' sang out the boys, as they cheerily weighed anchor,\r\nand prepared to stand out to sea. I could see, though he did not\r\ncomplain, that poor Jack had not yet recovered from the boar's rough\r\ntreatment, and moved very stiffly.\r\n\r\n`You must pilot us through the channel in the reef, this time, Fritz,'\r\nsaid I; adding, in a lower tone, `and then is it to be \"farewell\", my\r\nson!'\r\n\r\n`Yes, dear father--Au revoir!' returned he, brightly with a glance full\r\nof meaning, while he threw into his canoe a cushion and fur cloak.\r\n\r\n`Thanks, Fritz! But I'm going to honour them with the care of my\r\nbattered bones in the yacht here. You are awfully considerate though,\r\nold fellow,' remarked Jack, not for a moment doubting that his brother\r\nexpected him to return, as he came, beside him in the cajack.\r\n\r\nFritz laughed, and commended his decision. Then, springing into his\r\nskiff, he led the way towards the open sea.\r\n\r\nWe followed carefully and soon passed the reef; after which the boys\r\nwere very busy with the sails, putting the vessel on the homeward\r\ncourse, when, waving his hand to me, Fritz turned in the opposite\r\ndirection, and quickly vanished behind the point, which I afterwards\r\nnamed Cape Farewell.\r\n\r\nWhen missed by his brothers, I said he had a fancy to explore more of\r\nthe coast, and if he found it interesting, he might, instead of only a\r\nfew hours, remain absent for two or three days.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, we sailed into Safety Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nMy wife and Franz, though somewhat startled by the unexpected absence\r\nof Fritz, were delighted to see us return safely, and listened with\r\neager interest to our adventures. My wife shuddered, and scarcely\r\nsuppressed an involuntary scream as she heard of our desperate\r\nencounter with the lion and his mate. Jack's danger and providential\r\nescape, too, made her tremble; and so pale did he still look, that she\r\ncould scarcely believe he was uninjured.\r\n\r\nTears came into Franz's eyes when he heard of the sad death of poor old\r\nJuno; and he inquired most tenderly whether her remains had been\r\nbrought back, that they might be interred near the house which had been\r\nher home for so many years.\r\n\r\nNext day he saw her buried carefully; and Ernest, at his request,\r\nproduced an epitaph, which was inscribed upon a slab of stone above her\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n    'JUNO\r\n\r\n    'A servant true lies here:\r\n\r\n    'A faithful friend,\r\n\r\n    'A Dog,\r\n\r\n    'To all most dear;\r\n\r\n    'Who met her end\r\n\r\n    'Fighting right bravely in her master's cause.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the wild boar and the truffles were handed over to my\r\nwife, who received them with delight, promising us therefrom many a\r\nsavoury dish. She would fain have had the boar's head too; but my word\r\nwas pledged to Ernest that it should adorn his museum, and, though my\r\nlips watered to taste it baked in Hottentot fashion, I would not break\r\nmy promise. This splendid head, therefore, together with the lions'\r\nskins, we carried to the tannery on Whale Island, where they were\r\ncleaned and dressed.\r\n\r\nFive days passed, but Fritz still remained absent. I could not conceal\r\nmy anxiety, and at length determined to follow him. All were delighted\r\nat the proposal, and even my wife, when she heard that we were to sail\r\nin the pinnace, agreed to accompany us.\r\n\r\nThe boat was stored, and on a bright morning, with a favourable\r\nbreeze, we five, with the dogs, stepped aboard, and ran for Cape\r\nMinster.\r\n\r\nOur beautiful little yacht bounded over the water gaily, and the\r\nbright sunshine and delicious sea-breeze put us all in the highest\r\nspirits. The entrance of the archway was in sight, and thither I was\r\ndirecting the boat's course.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, right ahead, I saw a dark and shadowy mass just below the\r\nsurface of the water. `A sunken rock,' I thought to myself, `and yet it\r\nis strange that I never before noticed it.'\r\n\r\nI put down the helm in a moment, but a catastrophe seemed inevitable.\r\nWe surged ahead! A slight shock, and all was over! The danger was\r\npassed!\r\n\r\nI glanced astern, to look again at the dangerous spot; but the rock was\r\ngone, and, where but a moment before I had distinctly seen its great\r\ngreen shadow, I could now see nothing.\r\n\r\nBefore we had recovered from our amazement, a shout from Jack\r\nsurprised me.\r\n\r\n`There is another,' he exclaimed, `to starboard, father!' Sure enough,\r\nthere lay, apparently, another sunken rock.\r\n\r\n`The rock is moving!' shouted Franz; and a great black body emerged\r\nfrom the sea, while from the upper extremity rushed a column of water,\r\nwhich, with a mighty noise, rose upwards, and then fell like rain all\r\naround. The mystery was explained; for, as the great beast emerged yet\r\nfurther from the water, I recognized, from its enormous size and great\r\nlength of head, the cachalot whale.\r\n\r\nThe monster was apparently enraged at the way we had scratched his\r\nback; for, retreating to a short distance, he evidently meditated a\r\nrush upon us.\r\n\r\nFearful stories occurred to me of the savage temper of this whale, how\r\nhe has been known to destroy boat after boat, and even to sink great\r\nships, and with a feeling of desperation I sprang to one of the guns.\r\nJack leaped to the other, and almost simultaneously we fired. Both\r\nshots apparently took effect; for the whale, after lashing the water\r\nviolently for a few seconds, plunged beneath its surface, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWe kept a sharp look-out for him, for I was unwilling to lose such a\r\nvaluable prize and, reloading, stood towards the shore, in which\r\ndirection he was apparently making. Presently we again sighted him in\r\nshallow water, lashing fearfully with his tail, and dyeing the waves\r\naround him with blood. Approaching the infuriated animal as nearly as I\r\ndared, we again fired.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of the whale seemed for a few moments to become even yet\r\nmore frantic, and then, with a quiver from head to tail, he lay\r\nmotionless--dead!\r\n\r\nThe boys were about to raise a cry of victory, but checked the shout\r\nupon their very lips; for darting behind a rock they espied a canoe\r\npaddled by a tall and muscular savage, who now stood up in his skiff\r\nand appeared to be examining us attentively. Seeing that we were\r\nstanding towards him, the swarthy native seized his paddle and again\r\ndarted behind a rock. An awful thought now took possession of me. There\r\nmust be a tribe of blacks lurking on these shores, and Fritz must have\r\nfallen into their hands.\r\n\r\nWe, however, I determined, should not be easily taken; and our guns\r\nwere loaded and run out.\r\n\r\nPresently a dusky face appeared, peeping at us from a lofty rock: it\r\nvanished, and we saw another peeping at us from lower down.\r\n\r\nThen again the skiff put out as though to make a further reconnoitre.\r\nAll, even Jack, looked anxious, and glanced at me for orders.\r\n\r\n`Hoist a white flag,' said I, `and hand me the speaking-trumpet.' I\r\nseized the instrument and uttered such peaceable words in the Malay\r\nlanguage as I could recall: neither the flag nor my words seemed to\r\nproduce any effect, and the savage was about to return to the shore.\r\n\r\nJack hereupon lost patience, and in his turn took up the trumpet.\r\n\r\n`Come here, you black son of a gun,' he exclaimed. `Come on board and\r\nmake friends, or we'll blow you and your--'\r\n\r\n`Stop! Stop! You foolish boy,' I said. `You will but alarm the man,\r\nwith your wild words and gestures.'\r\n\r\n`No! But see,' he cried, `he is paddling towards us!'\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough the canoe was rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nPresently a cry from Franz alarmed me. `Look! Look!' he shrieked. `The\r\nvillain is in Fritz's cajack. I can see the walrus' head.'\r\n\r\nErnest alone remained unmoved. He took the speaking-trumpet: `Fritz,\r\nahoy!' he shouted. `Welcome, old fellow!'\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when I, too, recognized the\r\nwell-known face, beneath its dusky disguise.\r\n\r\nIn another minute the brave boy was on board, and in spite of his\r\nblackened face was kissed and welcomed heartily. He was now assailed\r\nwith a storm of questions from all sides: Where had he been? What had\r\nkept him so long, and why had he turned blackamoor?\r\n\r\n`The last question,' replied he, with a smile, `is the only one I will\r\nnow answer; the others shall be explained when I give a full account of\r\nmy adventures. Hearing guns fired, my mind was instantly filled with\r\nideas of Malay pirates, for I never dreamed that you could be here in\r\nthe yacht, so I disguised myself as you now see me, and came forth to\r\nreconnoitre. When you addressed me in Malay you only added to my\r\nterror, for it left not a doubt in my mind that you were pirates.'\r\n\r\nHaving in our turn described to him our adventure with the cachalot\r\nwhale, I asked him if he knew of a suitable spot for the anchorage of\r\nthe yacht.\r\n\r\n`Certainly,' he replied, casting towards me a glance full of meaning.\r\n`I can lead you to an island where there is splendid anchorage, and\r\nwhich is itself well worth seeing, for it contains all sorts of strange\r\nthings.' And after removing the stains from his skin, he again sprang\r\ninto his canoe and piloted us to a picturesque little island in the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nNow that there could be no doubt as to the success of Fritz's\r\nexpedition, I no longer hesitated to give to my wife an account of his\r\nproject, and to prepare her mind for the surprise which awaited her.\r\nShe was greatly startled, as I expected, and seemed almost overcome\r\nwith emotion at the idea of seeing a human being, and that being one of\r\nher own sex.\r\n\r\n`But why,' she asked, `did you not tell me of this at first? Why wait\r\nuntil the last moment with such joyful news?'\r\n\r\n`I was unwilling,' I replied, `to raise hopes which might never be\r\nrealized; but now, thank Heaven, he has succeeded, and there is no need\r\nfor concealment.'\r\n\r\nThe boys could not at all understand the evident air of mystery and\r\nsuppressed excitement which neither their mother, Fritz, nor I could\r\nentirely conceal. They cast glances of the greatest curiosity towards\r\nthe island, and as soon as the sails were furled and the anchor\r\ndropped, they sprang eagerly ashore. In a body we followed Fritz,\r\nmaintaining perfect silence.\r\n\r\nPresently we emerged from the thicket through which we were passing,\r\nand saw before us a hut of sheltering boughs, at the entrance of which\r\nburned a cheerful fire.\r\n\r\nInto this leafy bower Fritz dived, leaving his brothers without, mute\r\nwith astonishment. In another moment he emerged, leading by the hand a\r\nslight, handsome youth, by his dress apparently a young English naval\r\nofficer. The pair advanced to meet us; and Fritz, with a countenance\r\nradiant with joy, briefly introduced his companion as Edward Montrose.\r\n\r\n`And,' he continued, looking at his mother and me, `will you not\r\nwelcome him as a friend and a brother to our family circle?'\r\n\r\n`That will we, indeed!' I exclaimed, advancing and holding out my\r\nhands to the fair young stranger. `Our wild life may have roughened our\r\nlooks and manners, but it has not hardened our hearts, I trust.'\r\n\r\nThe mother, too, embraced the seeming youth most heartily. The lads,\r\nand even the dogs, were not behind-hand in testifying their\r\ngratification at the appearance of their new friend--the former\r\ndelighted at the idea of a fresh companion, and the latter won by her\r\nsweet voice and appearance.\r\n\r\nFrom the expressions made use of by Fritz I perceived that the girl\r\nwished her sex to remain unrevealed to the rest of the party until my\r\nwife could obtain for her a costume more suited to her real character.\r\n\r\nThe young men then ran down to the yacht to bring up what was\r\nnecessary for supper, as well as to make preparations for a camp in\r\nwhich we might spend the night. This done, my wife hastened to set\r\nbefore us a substantial meal, while the boys, anxious to make their new\r\nacquaintance feel at home amongst them, were doing their best to amuse\r\nher. She herself, after the first feeling of strangeness had worn off,\r\nentered fully into all their fun; and by the time they sat down to\r\nsupper was laughing and chatting as gaily as any one of the rest. She\r\nadmired the various dishes, tasted our mead and, without alluding once\r\nto her previous life, kept up a lively conversation.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact of meeting with any human being after so many years of\r\nisolation was in itself sufficient to raise the boys to the greatest\r\nstate of excitement; but that this being should be one so handsome; so\r\ngay, so perfectly charming, seemed completely to have fumed their\r\nheads; and when I gave the sign for the breaking-up of the feast, and\r\ntheir new friend was about to be led to the night-quarters which had\r\nbeen prepared for her on board the yacht, the health of Edward Montrose\r\nwas proposed, and drunk in fragrant mead, amidst the cheers and\r\nacclamations of all hands.\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, and silence had been restored, Jack exclaimed:\r\n\r\n`Now, then, Fritz, if you please, just tell me where you came across\r\nthis jolly fellow. Did you take your mysterious voyage in search of\r\nhim, or did you meet him by chance? Out with your adventures, while we\r\nsit comfortably round the fire.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, Jack cast more wood upon the blazing pile, and throwing\r\nhimself down in his usual careless fashion, prepared to listen\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\nFritz, after a few moments' hesitation, began: `Perhaps you remember,'\r\nsaid he, `how, when I returned from my expedition in the cajack the\r\nother day, I struck down an albatross. None but my father at the time\r\nknew, however, what became of the wounded bird, or even thought more\r\nabout it. Yet it was that albatross who brought me notice of the\r\nshipwrecked stranger; and he, too, I determined should carry back a\r\nmessage, to cheer and encourage the sender.\r\n\r\n`I first, as you know, prepared my cajack to carry two persons; and\r\nthen, with a heart full of hope and trust, left you and the yacht, and,\r\nwith Pounce seated before me, made for the open sea. For several hours\r\nI paddled steadily on, till, the wind freshening, I thought it\r\nadvisable to keep in nearer shore; that, should a regular storm arise,\r\nI might find some sheltered bay in which to weather it.\r\n\r\n`It was well I did so; for, scarcely had I reached a quiet cove which\r\npromised to afford me the protection I desired, than the sea appeared\r\none mass of foam: great surging waves arose; and even in the\r\ncomparative calm of the bay I felt that I was in some danger.\r\n\r\n`I passed the night in my cajack; and next morning, after a frugal meal\r\nof pemmican, and a draught of water from my flask, once more ventured\r\nforth. The wind had subsided, the sea was tolerably smooth; and,\r\nkeeping my eyes busily employed in seeking in every direction to\r\ndetect, if possible, the slightest trace of smoke, or other sign of\r\nhuman life, I paddled on till noon.\r\n\r\n`The aspect of the coast now began to change: the shores were sandy,\r\nwhile further inland lay dense forests, from whose gloomy depths I\r\ncould ever and anon hear the fierce roar of beasts of prey, the yell of\r\napes, the fiendish laugh of the hyaena, or the despairing death cry of\r\na hapless deer. Seldom have I experienced a greater feeling of solitude\r\nthan whilst listening to these strange sounds, and knowing that I in\r\nthis frail canoe was the only human being near. Giving myself up to\r\ncontemplation, I rested my paddle, and allowed my cajack to drift\r\nslowly on.\r\n\r\n`As I neared the shore, I noticed a large number of strange-looking\r\nbirds, who would sometimes flutter round me, and then dart back again\r\nto the border of the forest, where they were feeding on what appeared\r\nto be the pepper-plant; they seized the berries in their great\r\nponderous beaks, threw them up into the air and then dexterously caught\r\nthem in their fall. Their beaks were really something extraordinary:\r\nthey looked as though they must give their owners a perpetual headache,\r\nfrom their immense weight. The only thing that relieved the extreme\r\nugliness of these great appendages was their gorgeous colour, which was\r\nonly rivalled by the gay hue of the plumage.\r\n\r\n`I wish now that I had brought home a specimen; but, at the time, I was\r\nso much amused by watching the grotesque antics of the birds, that I\r\ndid not think of obtaining one. When I left the spot, I settled in my\r\nown mind that they were toucans: was I right, Ernest?'\r\n\r\nThe `Professor', unwilling to interrupt the narrative, merely gave an\r\noracular nod, and Fritz continued:\r\n\r\n`For some hours after this I paddled quickly on, sometimes passing the\r\nmouth of a stream, sometimes that of a broad river. Had I been merely\r\non an exploring expedition, I should have been tempted, doubtless, to\r\ncruise a little way up one of these pathways into the forest; but now\r\nsuch an idea did not enter my head. On, on, on, I felt I must go, until\r\nI should reach the goal of my voyage.\r\n\r\n`The shades of night at length drew on and, finding a sheltered cove, I\r\nmoored my cajack, and stepped on shore. You may imagine how pleasant it\r\nwas to stretch my legs, after sitting for so long in the cramped\r\nposition which my cajack enforces.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, however, to sleep on shore; so after preparing and\r\nenjoying my supper, I returned on board, and there spent the night.\r\n\r\n`Next morning Pounce and I again landed for breakfast. I lit my fire,\r\nand hung before it a plump young parrot to roast. As I was so doing, I\r\nheard a slight rustle amongst the long grass behind me. I glanced\r\nround, and there, with glaring eyes, and his great tail swaying to and\r\nfro, I saw an immense tiger.\r\n\r\n`In another moment his spring would have been made. I should have been\r\nno more, and our young guest would have been doomed to, God only knows\r\nhow many, more years of frightful solitude!\r\n\r\n`My gun was lying by my side. Before I could have stooped to pick it\r\nup, the monster would have seized me.\r\n\r\n`Pounce saw and comprehended my danger: the heroic bird darted upon my\r\nenemy, and so blinded him with his flapping wings, and the fierce blows\r\nof his beak, that his spring was checked, and I had time to recover my\r\nself-possession. I seized my gun and fired; and the brute, pierced to\r\nthe heart, gave one spring, and then rolled over at my feet.\r\n\r\n`My enemy was dead; but beside him--alas!--lay poor Pounce, crushed and\r\nlifeless. One blow of the great beast's paw had struck him down, never\r\nto rise again!' Fritz's voice shook as he came to this point; and,\r\nafter remaining silent for a moment or two, he continued, hurriedly:\r\n\r\n`With a sad and desolate feeling at my heart, I buried the faithful\r\nbird where he had met his death; and then, unable longer to continue\r\nnear the spot, I returned to my cajack, and leaving the great tiger\r\nlying where he fell, paddled hastily away.\r\n\r\n`My thoughts were gloomy. I felt as though, now that my companion was\r\ngone, I could no longer continue the voyage. The albatross, I thought,\r\nmay have flown for hundreds of miles before it reached me. This\r\nstranger may be on different shores from these entirely; every stroke\r\nof my paddle may be carrying me further from the blazing signal: who\r\nknows?\r\n\r\n`This feeling of discouragement was not, however, to be of long\r\nduration; for in a moment more a sight presented itself, which\r\nbanished all my doubts and fears, and raised me to the highest pitch of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n`A high point of land lay before me. I rounded it, and beyond found a\r\ncalm and pleasant bay, from whose curved and thickly wooded shores ran\r\nout a reef of rocks. From the point of this reef rose a column of\r\nsmoke, steadily and clearly curling upwards in the calm air. I could\r\nscarcely believe my senses, but stopped gazing at it, as though I were\r\nin a dream; then, with throbbing pulse and giddy brain, I seized my\r\npaddle, and strained every nerve to reach it.\r\n\r\n`A few strokes seemed to carry me across the bay, and, securing my\r\ncanoe, I leaped upon the rock, on which the beacon was blazing, but not\r\na sign of a human being could I see. I was about to shout, for as the\r\nfire had evidently been recently piled up, I knew the stranger could\r\nnot be far off; but, before I could do so, I saw a slight figure\r\npassing along the chain of rocks towards the spot on which I stood. You\r\nmay all imagine my sensations.\r\n\r\n`I advanced a few paces; and then mastering my emotion as best I\r\ncould, I said, in English:\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, fair stranger! God, in His mercy, has heard your call, and\r\nhas sent me to your aid!\"\r\n\r\n`Miss Montrose came quickly forward--'\r\n\r\n`Who? What?' shouted the boys, interrupting the narrative. `Who came\r\nforward?' and amid a general hubbub, Ernest, rising and advancing to\r\nhis brother, said in his quiet way:\r\n\r\n`I did not like to make any remark till you actually let out the\r\nsecret, Fritz, but we need no longer pretend not to see through the\r\ndisguise of Edward Montrose.'\r\n\r\nFritz, though much disconcerted by the discovery of the secret,\r\nrecovered his self-possession; and, after bearing with perfect\r\nequanimity the jokes with which his brothers assailed him, joined in\r\nthree cheers for their new sister, and when the confusion and laughter\r\nwhich ensued had subsided, continued his story.\r\n\r\n`Miss Montrose grasped my hands warmly, and guessing from my\r\npronunciation, I am afraid, that I was not in the habit of speaking\r\nEnglish every day of my life, said in French:\r\n\r\n`\"Long, long, have I waited since the bird returned with your message.\r\nThank God, you have come at last!\"\r\n\r\n`Then, with tears of joy and gratitude, she led me to the shore, where\r\nshe had built a hut and a safe sleeping-place, like Falconhurst on a\r\nsmall scale, among the branches of a tree. I was delighted with all she\r\nshowed me, for indeed her hut and its fittings evinced no ordinary\r\nskill and ingenuity. Round the walls hung bows, arrows, lances and\r\nbird-snares; while on her work-table, in boxes and cases, carved\r\nskilfully with a knife, were fish-hooks of mother-of-pearl, needles\r\nmade from fishbones, and bodkins from the beaks of birds, fishing-lines\r\nof all sorts, and knives and other tools.\r\n\r\nThese latter she told me were, with a chest of wearing apparel, almost\r\nthe only things washed ashore after the wreck, when three years ago she\r\nwas cast alone upon this desolate coast. I marvelled more and more at\r\nthe wonderful way in which this girl had surmounted obstacles, the\r\nquarter of which would completely have appalled the generality of her\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nThe hut itself was a marvel of skill; stout posts had been driven into\r\nthe ground, with cross pieces of bamboo, to form a framework; the walls\r\nhad then been woven with reeds, the roof thatched with palm-leaves, and\r\nthe whole plastered smoothly with clay, an open space being left in the\r\ncentre of the roof for a chimney to carry off the smoke of the fire.\r\n\r\n`As we entered, a cormorant, with a cry of anger, flew from under the\r\ntable towards me, and was about to attack me fiercely. Miss Montrose\r\ncalled it off, and she then told me she had captured and tamed the bird\r\nsoon after first landing, and since that time had contrived to train it\r\nto assist her in every conceivable way: it now not only was a pleasant\r\ncompanion, but brought her food of every description, fish, flesh and\r\nfowl, for whether it dived into the waters, according to its natural\r\nhabit, struck down birds upon the wing, or seized rabbits and other\r\nsmall animals upon the land, it laid all its booty at her feet.\r\n\r\n`Before darkness closed in, all the curiosities and ingenious\r\ncontrivances of the place had been displayed the kitchen-stove,\r\ncooking utensils, skin bottles, shell plates and spoons, the fishing\r\nraft, and numberless other things--and then, sitting down with my fair\r\nhostess to a most appetizing meal, she gave me a short account of her\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n`Jenny* Montrose was the daughter of a British officer who had served\r\nfor many years in India, where she herself was born. At the early age\r\nof three years she lost her mother.\r\n\r\n   * Some translations give her name as Emily.\r\n\r\n`After the death of his wife, all the Colonel's love and care was\r\ncentred upon his only child; under his eye she was instructed in all\r\nthe accomplishments suited to her sex; and from him she imbibed an\r\nardent love of field sports. By the time she was seventeen she was as\r\nmuch at home upon her horse in the field as in her father's\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n`Colonel Montrose now received orders to return home with his regiment\r\nand as, for certain reasons, he did not wish her to accompany him in\r\nthe ship with the troops, he obtained a passage for her on board a\r\nvessel which was about to sail at the same time.\r\n\r\n`The separation was extremely painful to both the old soldier and his\r\ndaughter, but there was no alternative. They parted, and Miss Montrose\r\nsailed in the Dorcas for England. A week after she had left Calcutta, a\r\nstorm arose and drove the vessel far out of her course; more bad\r\nweather ensued; and at length, leaks having been sprung in all\r\ndirections, the crew were obliged to take to the boats.\r\n\r\nJenny obtained a place in one of the largest of these. After enduring\r\nthe perils of the sea for many days, land was sighted; and, the other\r\nboats having disappeared, an attempt was made to land. The boat was\r\ncapsized, and Miss Montrose alone reached the shore. For a long time\r\nshe lay upon the sand almost inanimate; but, reviving sufficiently to\r\nmove, she at length obtained some shellfish, and by degrees recovered\r\nher strength.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth until I appeared she never set eyes upon a human\r\nbeing. To attract any passing vessel, and obtain assistance, however,\r\nshe kept a beacon continually blazing at the end of the reef; and, with\r\nthe same purpose in view, attached missives to the feet of any birds\r\nshe could take alive in her snares. The albatross, she told me, she had\r\nkept for some time and partially tamed; but, as it was in the habit of\r\nmaking long excursions on its own account, she conceived the idea of\r\nsending it also with a message, that, should it by chance be seen and\r\ntaken alive, it might return with an answer.\r\n\r\n`Our supper was over; and, at length, both wearied out with the\r\nanxieties and excitement of the day, we retired to rest, she to her\r\nleafy bower, and I to sleep in the hut below.\r\n\r\n`Next morning, having packed her belongings in the cajack, we both went\r\non board; and bidding adieu to her well-known bay she took her seat\r\nbefore me, and I made for home.\r\n\r\n`We should have reached Rockburg this evening had not an accident\r\noccurred to our skiff and compelled us to put in at this island. The\r\nboat was scarcely repaired when I heard your first shots. I instantly\r\ndisguised myself; and, never doubting that Malay pirates were near,\r\ncame forth to reconnoitre. Glad, indeed, I was to find my fears\r\nungrounded.'\r\n\r\nAll had listened attentively to Fritz's story, but now a dreadful yawn\r\nfrom Franz, followed by others from Jack, Ernest and Fritz, and a great\r\ndesire on my own part to follow their example, warned me that it was\r\ntime to dismiss the party for the night. Fritz retired to his cajack,\r\nthe boys and I to the deck of the yacht, and the remainder of the night\r\npassed quietly away.\r\n\r\nNext morning as we assembled for breakfast I took the opportunity of\r\nbegging Miss Montrose no longer to attempt to continue her disguise,\r\nbut to allow us to address her in her real character.\r\n\r\nJenny smiled; for she had noticed, as the young men met her when she\r\ncame from the cabin, a great alteration in their manner, and had at\r\nonce seen that her secret was guessed.\r\n\r\n`After all,' she said, `I need not be ashamed of this attire; it has\r\nbeen my only costume for the last three years, and in any other I\r\nshould have been unable to manage all the work which during that time\r\nhas been necessary.'\r\n\r\nOur pleasant meal over, I prepared to start for home, but Fritz\r\nreminded me of the cachalot, and although he confessed he should not\r\ncare to repeat the operation of cutting up a whale, he thought it would\r\nbe a pity to lose such a chance of obtaining a supply of spermaceti.\r\n\r\nI fully agreed with him; and embarking, we quickly reached the\r\nsandbank on which the monster lay. No sooner did we come near than the\r\ndogs leaped ashore, and before we could follow, rushed round to the\r\nother side of the great beast; snarling, growling and howling ensued,\r\nand when we reached the spot we found a terrific combat going on. A\r\ntroop of wolves were disputing fiercely with the dogs their right to\r\nthe prey.\r\n\r\nOur appearance, however, quickly settled the matter; two of the brutes\r\nalready lay dead, and those that now escaped our guns, galloped off.\r\nAmongst the pack were a few jackals, and no sooner did Coco catch sight\r\nof these, his relations, than, suddenly attracted by his instinct, he\r\nleft his master's side, and in spite of our shouts and cries, joined\r\nthem and disappeared into the forest.\r\n\r\nAs it would have been useless and dangerous to attempt to follow the\r\ndeserter into the woods, we left him alone, trusting that he would\r\nreturn before we again embarked. Fritz then climbed up the mountain of\r\nflesh, and with his hatchet quickly laid open the huge skull; Jack and\r\nFranz joined him--Ernest having remained on the island, where we had\r\nleft my wife and Jenny--and with buckets assisted him to bail out the\r\nspermaceti.\r\n\r\nThe few vessels we possessed were soon full, and having stored them in\r\nthe yacht, we once more embarked and arrived at the little island\r\nshortly before the dinner-hour.\r\n\r\nA capital meal had been prepared for us and, when we had made\r\nourselves presentable, we sat down to it, and related our adventures.\r\nThe account of Coco's desertion was received with exclamations of\r\nsurprise and sorrow. `Yet,' said Jenny, after a time, `I do not think\r\nyou should despair of his recovery, for animals in their native state\r\nseldom care to allow those that have been once domesticated to consort\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n`My poor albatross even, though he was never thoroughly tamed, and\r\ncertainly did finally desert me, yet used to return at intervals; and I\r\nam pretty sure that were you, Jack, to search the wood early tomorrow\r\nmorning, you would find your pet only too willing to come back to\r\ncivilized life; or, if you like, I will go myself and find him, for I\r\nshould immensely like to have a paddle in the cajack all by myself.'\r\n\r\nJack was delighted at the former suggestion, and though he would not\r\nlisten for a moment to Jenny's request to be allowed to go alone, he\r\nagreed, if she cared for the fun of an early cruise, to accompany her\r\nin the canoe next morning, and to return to the yacht in time to start\r\nfor Rockburg.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise they were off, armed with `bait' in the shape of meat and\r\nbiscuit, and a muzzle and chain which Jack had manufactured in the\r\nevening to punish the runagate for his offences, should they catch him.\r\nArrived at the sandbank, they landed; and, after entering the forest\r\nand shouting `Coco, Coco!' till the woods rang again, they presently\r\nespied the truant, slouching disconsolately towards them, looking very\r\nmiserable and heartily ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nWith torn ears, and coat ruffled and dirty, he sneaked up. There was no\r\nneed to use the bait to entice him; and when the poor beast thus came,\r\nunhappy and begging forgiveness, Jack had not the heart to degrade him\r\nfurther with the muzzle and chain. He had evidently attempted to join\r\nhis wild brethren, and by them had been scouted, worried, and hustled,\r\nas no true jackal; and, as Jenny had foretold, was now only too glad to\r\nreturn to bondage and to comfort.\r\n\r\nPoor Coco had recovered his spirits slightly by the time the yacht was\r\nreached; and, after a hearty meal, again took his place amongst the\r\ndogs, whom I had little doubt he would never again desert.\r\n\r\nAll was now bustle and activity; and breakfast over, we went aboard the\r\nyacht. Fritz and Jack stepped into the canoe; and we soon left Fair\r\nIsle and Pearl Bay far behind.\r\n\r\nThe morning was delightful. The sea, excepting for the slight ripple\r\nraised by the gentle breeze wafting us homewards, was perfectly calm.\r\nSlowly and contentedly we glided on through the wonders of the splendid\r\narchway, threaded our passage amongst the rocks and shoals, and passed\r\nout to the open sea. So slowly did we make our way, that the occupants\r\nof the cajack announced that they could not wait for us when they had\r\nonce piloted us out from amongst the shoals and reefs, and plied their\r\npaddles to such good purpose that they were soon out of sight.\r\n\r\nNautilus Bay and Cape Pug-Nose were in due time passed, however, and\r\nShark Island hove in sight. With great astonishment Jenny gazed at our\r\nwatch-tower, with its guard-house, the fierce-looking guns, and the\r\nwaving flag upon the heights. We landed, that she might visit the\r\nfortification; then we displayed all our arrangements with great pride.\r\nWhen they and the herd of lovely gazelles had been sufficiently\r\nadmired, we again embarked, and steered towards Safety Bay. On\r\nreaching the entrance, a grand salute of twelve shots welcomed us\r\nand our fair guest to Rockburg. Not pleased with the even number,\r\nhowever, Ernest insisted upon replying with thirteen guns, an odd\r\nnumber being, he declared, absolutely necessary for form's sake.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the quay, Fritz and Jack stood ready to receive us, and\r\nwith true politeness handed their mother and Jenny ashore.\r\n\r\nThey turned and led the way to the house through the gardens, orchards\r\nand shrubberies which lay on the rising ground that sloped gently\r\nupwards to our dwelling.\r\n\r\nJenny's surprise was changed to wonder as she neared the villa\r\nitself--its broad, shady balcony, its fountains sparkling in the sun,\r\nthe dove-cots, the pigeons wheeling above, and the bright, fresh\r\ncreepers twined round the columns, delighted her. She could scarcely\r\nbelieve that she was still far from any civilized nation, and that she\r\nwas amongst a family wrecked like herself upon a lonely coast.\r\n\r\nMy amazement, however, fully equalled that of my little daughter when\r\nbeneath the shade of the verandah I saw a table laid out with a\r\ndelicious luncheon. All our china, silver and glass had been called\r\ninto requisition, and was arranged upon the spotless damask cloth.\r\n\r\nWine sparkled in the decanters, splendid pineapples, oranges, guavas,\r\napples and pears, resting on cool green leaves, lay heaped in pyramids\r\nupon the porcelain dishes. A haunch of venison, cold fowl, ham, and\r\ntongues occupied the ends and sides of the table, while in the centre\r\nrose a vase of gay flowers, surrounded by bowls of milk and great jugs\r\nof mead. It was, indeed, a perfect feast, and the heartiness of the\r\nwelcome brought tears of joy into the lovely eyes of the fair girl in\r\nwhose honour it had been devised.\r\n\r\nAll were soon ready to sit down; and Jenny, looking prettier than ever\r\nin the dress for which she had exchanged her sailor's suit, took the\r\nplace of honour between my wife and me. Ernest and Franz also seated\r\nthemselves; but nothing would induce Fritz and Jack to follow their\r\nexample. They considered themselves our entertainers, and waited upon\r\nus most attentively, carving the joints, filling our glasses, and\r\nchanging the plates; for, as Jack declared to Miss Montrose, the\r\nservants had all run away in our absence, and for the next day or two,\r\nperhaps, we should be obliged to wait upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the banquet was over, and the waiters had satisfied their\r\nappetites, they joined their brothers, and with them displayed all the\r\nwonders of Rockburg to their new sister. To the house, cave, stables,\r\ngardens, fields and boat-houses, to one after the other did they lead\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNot a corner would they have left unnoticed, had not my wife, fearing\r\nthey would tire the poor girl out, come to the rescue, and led her back\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, after an early breakfast, we started, while it\r\nwas yet cool, for Falconhurst; and as I knew that repairs and\r\narrangements for the coming winter would be necessary and would detain\r\nus for several days, we took with us a supply of tools, as well as\r\nbaskets of provisions and other things essential to our comfort.\r\n\r\nThe whole of our stud, excepting the ostrich, were in their paddocks,\r\nnear the tree; but Jack, saying that his mother and Jenny really must\r\nnot walk the whole way, to the great amusement of the latter, leaped on\r\nHurry, and fled away in front of us. Before we had accomplished one\r\nquarter of the distance, we heard the thundering tread of many feet\r\ngalloping down the avenue, and presently espied our motley troop of\r\nsteeds being driven furiously towards us.\r\n\r\nStorm, Lightfoot, Swift, Grumble, Stentor, Arrow and Dart were there,\r\nwith Jack, on his fleet two-legged courser, at their heels. At his\r\nsaddle-bow hung a cluster of saddles and bridles, the bits all jangling\r\nand clanking, adding to the din and confusion, and urging on the\r\nexcited animals, who thoroughly entered into the fun, and with tails in\r\nthe air, ears back, and heels ever and anon thrown playfully out,\r\nseemed about to overwhelm us.\r\n\r\nWe stepped aside to shelter ourselves behind the trees from the\r\nfurious onset; but a shout from Fritz brought the whole herd to a\r\nsudden halt, and Jack spurred towards us.\r\n\r\n`Which of the cattle shall we saddle for you, Jenny?' he shouted.\r\n`They're all as gentle as lambs, and as active as cats. Every one has\r\nbeen ridden by mother; and knows what a side-saddle means, so you can't\r\ngo wrong.'\r\n\r\nTo his great delight, Jenny quickly showed her appreciation of the\r\nmerits of the steeds by picking out Dart, the fleetest and most\r\nspirited in the whole stud.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich was then relieved of his unusual burden, the animals were\r\nspeedily equipped, and Lightfoot bearing the baskets and hampers, the\r\nwhole party mounted and trotted forwards. Jenny was delighted with her\r\npalfrey, and henceforward he was reserved for her special use.\r\n\r\nThe work at Falconhurst, as I had expected, occupied us for some time\r\nand it was a week before we could again return to Rockburg.\r\n\r\nYet the time passed pleasantly; for though the young men were busy from\r\nmorning to night, the presence of their new companion, her lively\r\nspirits and gay conversation, kept them in constant good humour.\r\n\r\nWhen the repairs were all finished we remained yet a day or two\r\nlonger, that we might make excursions in various directions to bring in\r\npoultry from Woodlands, stores of acorns for the pigs, and grass,\r\nwillows and canes, to be manufactured during the winter into mats,\r\nbaskets, hurdles and hen-coops.\r\n\r\nMany a shower wetted us through during these days, and we had scarcely\r\ntime to hurry back to Rockburg and house our cattle and possessions\r\nbefore the annual deluge began.\r\n\r\nNever before had this dreary season seemed so short and pleasant; with\r\nJenny amongst us the usual feeling of weariness and discontent never\r\nappeared; the English language was quickly acquired by all hands,\r\nFritz, in particular, speaking it so well that Jenny declared she could\r\nscarcely believe he was not an Englishman. She herself already spoke\r\nFrench, and therefore easily learned our native language and spoke it\r\nfluently before we were released from our captivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 18\r\n\r\nMany wondrous tales were told or read in turn by the boys and Jenny\r\nduring the long evenings as we sat drawing, weaving and plaiting in our\r\nrosy study. In fact this winter was a truly happy time, and when at\r\nlength the rain ceased and the bright sun again smiled upon the face of\r\nnature, we could scarcely believe, as we stepped forth and once more\r\nfelt the balmy breath of spring, that, for so many weeks, we had been\r\nprisoners within our rocky walls.\r\n\r\nAll was once more activity and life; the duties in field, garden and\r\norchard called forth the energy of the lads, whilst their mother and\r\nsister found abundant occupation in the poultry-yard and house.\r\n\r\nOur various settlements and stations required attention. Falconhurst,\r\nWoodlands, Prospect Hill, Shark and Whale Islands were in turn visited\r\nand set in order. The duty of attending to the island battery fell to\r\nJack and Franz.\r\n\r\nThey had been busy all day repairing the flagstaff, rehoisting the\r\nflag, and cleaning and putting into working order the two guns. Evening\r\nwas drawing on and our day's work over; the rest of us were strolling\r\nup and down upon the beach enjoying the cool sea breeze. We watched the\r\nlads as they completed their work. They loaded and ran out their guns\r\nand, paddling off with an empty tub in the cajack, placed it out to sea\r\nas a mark for practice. They returned and fired, and the barrel flew in\r\npieces; with a shout of triumph, they cleaned the guns and ran them in.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they done so when, as though in answer to their shots,\r\ncame the sound of three guns booming across the water from the\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nWe stopped, speechless. Was it fancy? Had we really heard guns from a\r\nstrange ship? Or had the boys again fired? No! There were the lads\r\nleaping into their canoe and paddling in hot haste towards us. They,\r\ntoo, had heard the sound.\r\n\r\nA tumult of feelings rushed over us--anxiety, joy, hope, doubt, each in\r\nturn took possession of our minds. Was it a European vessel close upon\r\nour shores, and were we about to be linked once more to civilized life?\r\nOr did those sounds proceed from a Malay pirate, who would rob and\r\nmurder us? What was to be the result of meeting with our fellow beings;\r\nwere they to be friends who would help us, enemies who would attack us,\r\nor would they prove unfortunate creatures in need of our assistance?\r\nWho could tell?\r\n\r\nBefore we could express these thoughts in words the cajack had touched\r\nthe shore, and Jack and Franz were among us.\r\n\r\n`Did you hear them? Did you hear them?' they gasped. `What shall we do?\r\nWhere shall we go?'\r\n\r\n`Oh, Fritz,' continued my youngest son, `it must be a European ship. We\r\nshall find her. We shall see our Fatherland once more,' and, in an\r\nemotion of joy, he grasped his brother's hands.\r\n\r\nTill then I knew not what a craving for civilized life had been\r\naroused in the two young men by the appearance of their European\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned towards me. What would I advise?\r\n\r\n`At present,' I said, `we can do nothing, for night is drawing on. We\r\nmust make what preparation we can, and pray for guidance.' In the\r\ngreatest excitement we returned to the house, all talking eagerly, and\r\ntill late no one could be persuaded to retire to rest.\r\n\r\nFew slept that night. The boys and I took it in turn to keep watch from\r\nthe verandah, lest more signals might be fired, or a hostile visit\r\nmight be paid us. But about midnight the wind began to rise, and before\r\nwe reassembled to discuss our plans a fearful storm was raging; so\r\nterrific was the sea that I knew no boat could live, and had a\r\nbroadside been fired at the entrance of the Bay we should not have\r\nheard it through the howling of the blast.\r\n\r\nFor two days and two nights the hurricane continued, but on the third\r\nday the sun again appeared, and, the wind lulling, the sea went rapidly\r\ndown. Full of anxiety I readily complied with the boys' desire to put\r\noff to Shark Island and discharge the guns; for who could tell what had\r\nbeen the result of the gale; perhaps the vessel had been driven upon\r\nthe rocky shore or, fearing such a fate, she had left the coast and\r\nweathered the storm out at sea; if so she might never return.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts I accompanied Jack and Franz to the fort.\r\nOne--two--we fired the guns and waited.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes there was no reply, and then an answering report\r\nrolled in the distance. There was no longer room for doubt; the\r\nstrangers were still in the vicinity, and were aware of our presence.\r\nWe waved the flag as a signal to those on shore that all was well, and\r\nquickly returned. We found the whole family in a state of the greatest\r\nexcitement, and I felt it necessary to calm them down as much as\r\npossible, for neither could I answer the questions with which I was\r\nbesieged, nor could I conceal the fact that the visit of the vessel\r\nmight not prove so advantageous as they expected.\r\n\r\nFritz and I at once prepared to make a reconnaissance; we armed\r\nourselves with our guns, pistols and cutlasses, took a spy-glass,\r\nseated ourselves in the cajack and, with a parting entreaty from my\r\nwife to be cautious, paddled out of the bay and round the high cliffs\r\non our left. For nearly an hour we advanced in the direction from which\r\nthe reports of the guns seemed to proceed. Nothing could we see,\r\nhowever, but the frowning rocks and cliffs, and the waves beating\r\nrestlessly at their base. Cape Pug-Nose was reached, and we began to\r\nround the bluff old point.\r\n\r\nIn a moment all our doubts were dispelled, and joy and gratitude to the\r\nGreat Giver of all good filled our hearts. There, in the little\r\nsheltered cove beyond the cape, her sails furled, and anchor dropped,\r\nlay a brig-of-war with the English colours at her masthead.\r\n\r\nWith the glass I could discern figures upon the deck and, upon the\r\nshore beyond, several tents pitched under the shelter of the trees, and\r\nthe smoke of fires rising amongst them. As I handed the glass to Fritz,\r\nI felt a sudden misgiving. `What,' said I to myself, `can this English\r\nvessel be doing thus far from the usual track of ships?' and I called\r\nto mind tales of mutinous crews who have risen against their officers,\r\nhave chosen some such sheltered retreat as this; have disguised the\r\nvessel, and then sailed forth to rob and plunder upon the high seas.\r\n\r\nFritz then exclaimed, `I can see the captain, father, he is speaking to\r\none of the officers, and I can see his face quite well; he is English,\r\nI am certain he is English, and the flag speaks the truth!' and he put\r\nthe glass again in my hand that I might see for myself.\r\n\r\nStill keeping under the shelter of the cliff, I carefully surveyed the\r\nvessel. There was no doubt that Fritz was right, and my fears were once\r\nmore dispelled; all was neatness and regularity on board; the spotless\r\ndecks, the burnished steel and brass, and the air of perfect order\r\nwhich pervaded both ship and camp, betokened that authority and\r\ndiscipline there reigned.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes longer we continued our examination of the scene, and\r\nthen satisfied by the appearance of the camp on shore, that there was\r\nno chance of the brig quitting the coast for several days, we resolved\r\nto return without betraying our presence, for I was unwilling to appear\r\nbefore these strangers until we could do so in better form, and in a\r\nmanner more in accordance with our actual resources.\r\n\r\nWe again landed at Rockburg, where our family awaited our arrival in\r\neager expectation, and as fully as possible we told them of all we had\r\nseen. They thoroughly approved of our caution, and even Jenny, whose\r\nhopes had been excited to the highest pitch by our description of the\r\nEnglish vessel, and who longed to meet her countrymen once more, agreed\r\nto postpone the visit until the following day, when, having put our\r\nyacht into good order, we might pay our respects to the captain, not as\r\npoor shipwrecked creatures begging assistance, but as lords and masters\r\nof the land, seeking to know for what purpose strangers were visiting\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was occupied in making our preparations. Our\r\ndainty little craft was made to look her very best; her decks were\r\nscrubbed, her brass guns burnished, all lumber* removed and put ashore,\r\nand the flag of England hoisted to her peak.\r\n\r\n   * Junk, things stored but not in use.\r\n\r\nMy wife overhauled our wardrobes, and the neatest uniforms were put\r\nready for the boys and me, for though neither my wife nor Jenny had\r\never dreamed of appearing otherwise than they would have done, had they\r\nbeen at home amongst civilized people in Europe, yet we, accustomed\r\ndaily to rough and often even dirty work, had adopted just that costume\r\nwhich best suited our comfort and inclination. We should indeed have\r\nsurprised the smart man-o'-war's men, had we appeared in our great\r\nshapeless wide-brimmed hats, our linen coats and trousers, our broad\r\nleathern belts and hairy buskins; so we next day readily donned the\r\nmore becoming costumes.\r\n\r\nAt the break of that eventful morn, when we were destined once more to\r\nset our eyes upon our fellow men, and to hear news of the outer world,\r\nfrom which for so many years we had been exiled, we assembled in our\r\nlittle breakfast-room. The meal was eaten hurriedly and almost in\r\nsilence, for our hearts were too full, and our minds too busily\r\noccupied, to allow of any outward display of excitement. Fritz and Jack\r\nthen slipped quietly out, and presently returned from the garden with\r\nbaskets of the choicest fruits in fresh and fragrant profusion, and\r\nwith these, as presents for the strangers, we went on board our yacht.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was weighed, the sails set, and with the canoe in tow the\r\nlittle vessel, as though partaking of our hopes and joyous\r\nexpectation, bounded merrily over the waters of Safety Bay, gave a wide\r\nberth to the Reef, against whose frowning rocks the sea still lashed\r\nitself to foam, and kept away for the cove, where the English ship\r\nunconsciously awaited us. The Pug-nosed Cape was reached, and to the\r\nsurprise and utter amazement of the strangers, we rounded the point and\r\nbrought up within hail.\r\n\r\nEvery eye on board and on shore was turned towards us, every glass was\r\nproduced and fixed upon our motions; for of all the strange sights\r\nwhich the gallant crew may have looked for, such an anomaly as a\r\npleasure yacht, manned by such a party as ours, and cruising upon this\r\nstrange and inhospitable shore, was the furthest from their thoughts.\r\n\r\nFritz and I stepped into our boat, and pulled for the brig. In another\r\nminute we were upon her deck. The captain, with the simple frankness of\r\na British seaman, welcomed us cordially, and having led us into his\r\ncabin, begged us to explain to what good fortune he owed a visit from\r\nresidents upon a coast generally deemed uninhabited, or the abode of\r\nthe fiercest savages.\r\n\r\nI gave him an outline of the history of the wreck, and of our sojourn\r\nupon these shores, and spoke to him, too, of Miss Montrose, and of the\r\nprovidential way in which we had been the means of rescuing her from\r\nher lonely position.\r\n\r\n`Then,' said the gallant officer, rising and grasping Fritz by the\r\nhand, `let me heartily thank you in my own name, and in that of Colonel\r\nMontrose; for it was the hope of finding some trace of that brave girl\r\nthat led me to these shores. The disappearance of the Dorcas has been a\r\nterrible blow to the Colonel, and yet, though for three years no word\r\nof her or of any of those who sailed in her has reached England, he has\r\nnever entirely abandoned all hope of again hearing of his daughter. I\r\nknew this, and a few weeks ago, when I was about to leave Sydney for\r\nthe Cape, I found three men who declared themselves survivors of the\r\nDorcas, and said that their boat, of four which left the wreck, was the\r\nonly one which, to their knowledge, reached land in safety.\r\n\r\n`From them I learned all particulars, and applying for permission to\r\ncruise in these latitudes, I sailed in the hopes of finding further\r\ntraces of the unfortunate crew. My efforts have been rewarded by\r\nunlooked-for success.'\r\n\r\nFritz replied most modestly to the praises which he received, and then\r\nthe captain begged to be introduced to my wife and Miss Montrose.\r\n\r\n`And,' he continued, `if it be not contrary to your rules of\r\ndiscipline, for the whole ship's company to be absent at once, I will\r\nnow send a boat for the remainder of your party.'\r\n\r\nOne of the officers was accordingly dispatched to the yacht with a\r\npolite message, and the mother, Jenny, and the three boys were\r\npresently on board.\r\n\r\nOur kind host greeted them most warmly, and he and his officers vied\r\nwith one another in doing us honour. They proved, indeed, most pleasant\r\nentertainers, and the time passed rapidly away.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon the captain told us that there had sailed with him from\r\nSydney an invalid gentleman, Mr. Wolston, his wife, and two daughters;\r\nbut that though the sea voyage had been recommended on account of his\r\nhealth, yet it had not done Mr. Wolston so much good as had been\r\nanticipated, and he had suffered so greatly from the effects of the\r\nstorm which had driven the Unicorn into the bay for repairs, that he\r\nhad been eager to rest for a short time on land.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious to meet the family, and in the afternoon it was\r\ndecided that we should pay them a visit. Tents had been pitched for\r\ntheir accommodation under the shady trees, and when we landed we found\r\nMr. Wolston seated by one of them, enjoying the cool sea-breeze. He and\r\nhis family were delighted to see us, and so much did we enjoy their\r\nsociety, that evening found us still upon the shore. It was too late\r\nthen to return to Rockburg, and the captain kindly offered tents for\r\nthe accommodation of those who could not find room in the yacht. The\r\nboys spent the night on land.\r\n\r\nThat night I had a long and serious consultation with my wife, as to\r\nwhether or not we really had any well-grounded reason for wishing to\r\nreturn to Europe. It would be childish to undertake a voyage thither\r\nsimply because an opportunity offered for doing so.\r\n\r\nNeither knew to what decision the feelings of the other inclined; each\r\nwas afraid of expressing what might run counter to those feelings; but\r\ngradually it began to appear that neither entertained any strong wish\r\nto leave the peaceful island; and finally we discovered that the real\r\nwish which lay at the bottom of both our hearts was to adopt New\r\nSwitzerland as thenceforward our home.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more delightful than to find harmony of opinion in those we\r\nlove, when a great and momentous decision has to be taken?\r\n\r\nMy dear wife assured me that she desired nothing more earnestly than to\r\nspend the rest of her days in a place to which she had become so much\r\nattached, provided I, and at least two of her sons, also wished to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nFrom the other two she would willingly part, if they chose to return to\r\nEurope, with the understanding that they must endeavour to send out\r\nemigrants of a good class to join us, and form a prosperous colony,\r\nadding that she thought the island ought to continue to bear the name\r\nof our native country, even if inhabited in future time by colonists\r\nfrom England, as well as from Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI heartily approved of this excellent idea, and we agreed to mention\r\nit, while consulting with Captain Littlestone on the subject of placing\r\nthe island under the protection of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThen came the question as to which of our sons were best suited to\r\nremain with us, and which to go away.\r\n\r\nThis point we left undecided, thinking that in the course of a few\r\ndays, they would probably make a choice of their own accord, which they\r\ndid, even sooner than we anticipated. After breakfast, it was proposed\r\nthat Captain Littlestone should bring his ship round to Safety Bay,\r\nthat we might receive a visit from him and his party, at\r\nRockburg--where we invited the invalid, Mr. Wolston, and his family, in\r\nhopes that his health might benefit by a comfortable residence on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this plan adopted, than Fritz and Jack hurried off in the\r\ncanoe to prepare for their reception, being followed in more leisurely\r\nstyle by the brig and our yacht.\r\n\r\nBut what words can express the amazement of our guests, when, rounding\r\nthe Rocky Cape at the entrance, Safety Bay, and the beautiful domain of\r\nRockburg, lay before them.\r\n\r\nStill greater was their astonishment, as a salute of eleven guns\r\nboomed from the battery on Shark Island, where the royal standard of\r\nEngland was displayed and floated majestically on the morning breeze.\r\n\r\nA glow of surprise and pleasure beamed on every countenance, and poor\r\nWolston's spirits appeared to revive with the very idea of the peace\r\nand happiness to be enjoyed in such a home.\r\n\r\nHe was carried on shore with the utmost care and tenderness, and\r\ncomfortably established in my room, a camp-bed for Mrs. Wolston being\r\nadded to the furniture there, that she might be able conveniently to\r\nattend on her husband.\r\n\r\nMeantime the scene at the harbour and all round Rockburg was of the\r\nliveliest description; merriment and excitement prevailed in all\r\ndirections, as the beauties and wonders of our residence were\r\nexplored, so that a summons to dinner scarcely attracted notice.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a visit to Falconhurst was projected, the company was at\r\nlength induced to be seated, and to partake of our good cheer, but the\r\nspirit of restlessness soon returned, and the young people kept roaming\r\nabout through our hitherto quiet lawns, avenues and shrubberies, until\r\nI was ready to believe their number three times what it actually was.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the universal excitement began to abate, and the party\r\nassembled for supper with tolerable composure.\r\n\r\nMr. Wolston was able to join us, as the rest he had enjoyed, and the\r\npleasure inspired by the hope of a residence among us, seemed to have\r\ngiven him new life. This wish he now distinctly expressed in his own\r\nname, and in that of his wife; inquiring what our intentions were, and\r\nproposing, if agreeable to us, that they, with their eldest daughter,\r\nwhose health, like his own, was delicate, should make a long stay on\r\nthe island, while the younger daughter went for the present to her\r\nbrother at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nIn the event of his ultimately deciding to settle altogether among us,\r\nMr. Wolston would propose that his son should leave the Cape, and join\r\nour colony.\r\n\r\nWith sincere satisfaction, I welcomed this proposal, saying that it was\r\nmy wish and that of my wife to remain for the rest of our days in New\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n`Hurrah for New Switzerland! New Switzerland for ever!' shouted the\r\nwhole company enthusiastically, as they raised their glasses, and made\r\nthem touch with a musical ring, which so expressively denotes a joyful\r\nunanimity of sentiment.\r\n\r\n`Prosperity to New Switzerland; long may she flourish,' echoed on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n`Long life and happiness to those who make New Switzerland their\r\nhome!' added Ernest to my great surprise, leaning forward as he spoke,\r\nto ring his glass with mine, his mother's and Mr. Wolston's.\r\n\r\n`Won't somebody wish long life and prosperity to those who go away?'\r\ninquired Jenny with a pretty arch look. `Much as I long to return to\r\nEngland and my father, my inclination will waver if all the cheers are\r\nfor New Switzerland!'\r\n\r\n`Three cheers for England and Colonel Montrose,' cried Fritz, `success\r\nand happiness to us who return to Europe!' and while the vaulted roofs\r\nrang with the cheering elicited by this toast, a glance from Jenny\r\nshowed him how much she thanked him for appreciating her wish to return\r\nto her father, notwithstanding her attachment to our family.\r\n\r\n`Well,' said I, when silence was restored, `since Fritz resolves to go\r\nto England, he must undertake for me the duty of bringing happiness to\r\na mourning father by restoring to him this dear daughter, whom I have\r\nbeen ready to regard as my own, by right of finding her cast on the\r\nshores of my island.\r\n\r\n`Ernest chooses to remain with me. His mother and I rejoice heartily in\r\nthis decision, and promise him all the highest scientific appointments\r\nin our power to bestow.\r\n\r\n`And now what is Jack's choice? The only talent I can say he possesses\r\nis that of a comic actor, and to shine on the stage he must needs go to\r\nEurope.'\r\n\r\n`Jack is not going to Europe, however,' was his reply. `He means to\r\nstay here, and when Fritz is gone, he will be the best rider, and the\r\nbest shot in New Switzerland, which is the summit of his ambition.\r\n\r\n`The fact is,' he continued, laughing, `I rather stand in awe of their\r\nEuropean schools, and should expect to find myself caught and clapped\r\ninto one, if I ventured too near them.'\r\n\r\n`A good school is exactly what I want,' said Franz. `Among a number of\r\nstudents there is some emulation and enthusiasm, and I shall have a\r\nchance of rising in the world.\r\n\r\n`Fritz will probably return here some day; but it might be well for one\r\nmember of the family to go home with the intention of remaining there\r\naltogether, and as I am the youngest, I could more easily than the\r\nrest, adapt myself to a different life. My father, however, will decide\r\nfor me.'\r\n\r\n`You may go, my dear son,' I replied, `and God bless all our plans and\r\nresolutions. The whole earth is the Lord's, and where, as in his sight,\r\nyou lead good and useful lives, there is your home.\r\n\r\n`And now that I know your wishes, the only question is, whether\r\nCaptain Littlestone will kindly enable you to carry them out?'\r\n\r\nAll eyes were fixed eagerly upon him, and after a moment's pause the\r\ngallant officer spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n`I think my way in this matter is perfectly clear, and I consider that\r\nI have been providentially guided to be the means of once more placing\r\nthis family in communication with their friends and with the civilized\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n`My orders were to search for a shipwrecked crew.\r\n\r\n`Survivors from two wrecks have been discovered.\r\n\r\n`Three passengers express a wish to leave my ship here, instead of at\r\nthe Cape, while, at the same time, I am requested to give to three\r\npersons a passage to England.\r\n\r\n`Could anything suit better? I am most willing to undertake the charge\r\nof those who may be committed to my care.\r\n\r\n`Every circumstance has been wonderfully ordered and linked together by\r\nDivine Providence, and if England gains a prosperous and happy colony,\r\nit will prove a fitting clasp to this fortunate chain of events. Three\r\ncheers for New Switzerland.'\r\n\r\nDeep emotion stirred every heart as the party separated for the night.\r\nMany felt that they were suddenly standing on the threshold of a new\r\nlife, while, for myself a weight was rolled from my heart, and I\r\nthanked God that a difficulty was solved which, for years, had\r\noppressed me with anxiety.\r\n\r\nAfter this nothing was thought of but making preparations for the\r\ndeparture of the dear ones bound for England. Captain Littlestone\r\nallowed as much time as he could spare; but it was necessarily short,\r\nso that incessant movement and industry pervaded the settlement for\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nEverything was provided and packed up that could in any way add to our\r\nchildren's comfort on the voyage, or benefit them after their arrival\r\nin England, and a large share of my possessions in pearls, corals,\r\nfurs, spices and other valuables would enable them to take a good\r\nposition in the world of commerce.\r\n\r\nI committed to their care private papers, money, and jewels which I\r\nknew to have been the personal property of the captain of our\r\nill-fated ship, desiring them to hand them over, if possible, to his\r\nheirs. A short account of the wreck, with the names of the crew, a list\r\nof which I had found, was given to Captain Littlestone.\r\n\r\nHis ship, the Unicorn, was amply stored by us with fresh provisions,\r\nfish, vegetables and fruit, for in our gratitude to him for his\r\nkindness and sympathy, we felt ready to offer every possible\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn a long conversation with my sons I solemnly charged them with the\r\nfuture responsibilities of their life, in all its varied aspects, of\r\nduty towards God, their fellow men, and themselves, pointing out the\r\ntemptations to which their different characters were likely to expose\r\nthem, and exhorting them affectionately to hold fast to the faith in\r\nwhich they had been brought up.\r\n\r\nFritz, having previously made known to me, what indeed was very\r\nevident, the attachment between himself and Jenny, I advised him to\r\nmention it to Colonel Montrose as soon as possible after being\r\nintroduced to him, and ask for his sanction to their engagement.\r\n\r\nI on my part, gladly bestowing mine, as did his mother, who loved the\r\nsweet girl dearly, and heartily grieved to part with her.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before our separation, I gave to Fritz the journal in\r\nwhich, ever since the shipwreck, I had chronicled the events of our\r\nlife, desiring that the story might be printed and published. `It was\r\nwritten, as you well know,' said I, `for the instruction and amusement\r\nof my children, but it is very possible that it may be useful to other\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\n`Children are, on the whole, very much alike everywhere, and you four\r\nlads fairly represent multitudes, who are growing up in all\r\ndirections. It will make me happy to think that my simple narrative may\r\nlead some of these to observe how blessed are the results of patient\r\ncontinuance in well-doing, what benefits arise from the thoughtful\r\napplication of knowledge and science, and how good and pleasant a thing\r\nit is when brethren dwell together in unity, under the eyes of parental\r\nlove.'\r\n\r\nNight has closed around me.\r\n\r\nFor the last time my united family slumbers beneath my care. Tomorrow\r\nthis closing chapter of my journal will pass into the hands of my\r\neldest son.\r\n\r\nFrom afar I greet thee, Europe!\r\n\r\nI greet thee, dear old Switzerland!\r\n\r\nLike thee, may New Switzerland flourish and prosper--good, happy and\r\nfree!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you enjoy this Editor's Cut(tm) edition?\r\n\r\nThen watch www.pink-tree-press.com for more of The Castaways\r\nCollection including <Masterman Ready>, <Robinson Crusoe>, <The\r\nMysterious Island>, and <In Search of the Castaways>.\r\n\r\nOther Editor's Cut(tm) Editions will include Gene Stratton-Porter's\r\n<Freckles> and <Girl of the Limberlost>, Eleanor Porter's beloved\r\n<Pollyanna> as well as her almost-forgotten classic <Just David>, and\r\nmany, many more selections, all painstakingly re-edited to suit the\r\ntastes of the Twenty-First Century homeschoolers and other interested\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis edition (c)2000\r\nby\r\nPink Tree Press\r\nPO Box 16536\r\nSalt Lake City, Utah 84116\r\nISBN 1-930860-50-1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Swiss Family Robinson, by Johann David Wyss",
