Osborne is in charge of plant-breeding research being\r\nconducted by the University of Tennessee’s Agricultural Research\r\nLaboratory for the Atomic Energy Commission. He has been in this work\r\nsince 1953.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Osborne is a teacher at heart. Hence when students wrote\r\ninquiring about the effects of radiation on seeds, he took great\r\ninterest in replying. From these replies grew mimeographed literature\r\nsuggesting experiments for students; then this and other booklets.\r\n\r\nDr. Osborne received his undergraduate degree from Oklahoma State\r\nUniversity and his doctorate from Washington State University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Atoms in Agriculture\r\n\r\n\r\nby Thomas S. Osborne,\r\nAssociate Professor of Agronomy, University of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n  _To know what questions to put to Nature—that is 95 per cent of\r\n  scientific research._\r\n                                                              —Whitehead\r\n\r\nIf man’s existence on the earth is compared to a calendar year, then he\r\nbegan farming in the very early morning of December 30 and began\r\napplying systematic knowledge to agriculture at 10:15 p.m. on December\r\n31.\r\n\r\nThe first traces of man on the earth are dated at about one and\r\nthree-quarter million years ago. Plant life then was very much like\r\nplant life today, but the animal population was quite different. Man\r\nbecame a producer of plants and animals instead of merely a gatherer and\r\nhunter about 8000 years ago. He has applied systematic study to\r\ncultivated plants and animals for only 300 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Research in the United States\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates of crop losses in the United States each year are\r\napproximately $5 billion to weeds, $4 billion to insects, and $3 billion\r\nto diseases. This total loss of $12 billion a year is about $22,500 a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to reduce these losses and to raise the standard of living,\r\nagricultural research has become more specialized and more complex. Over\r\nthe years it has gradually changed from trial-and-error attempts to\r\nincrease production to the actual study of basic questions. To study\r\nsuch intricate systems as the leaf of a plant or the liver of an animal,\r\nagricultural science has had to draw from every other science. The use\r\nof radioactive tracers and radiations in research looks especially\r\npromising to agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn fact, agriculture has already begun to benefit from the applications\r\nof such research. Radioactive techniques have been used to study soils,\r\nplants, microbes, insects, farm animals, and new ways to use and\r\npreserve foodstuffs. Radioactive atoms are not used directly by farmers\r\nbut are used in research directed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\nand Atomic Energy Commission, by the agricultural experiment stations of\r\nthe various states, and by numerous public and private research\r\ninstitutions. From such research come improved materials and methods\r\nwhich are used on the farm.\r\n\r\nIn more highly developed countries agricultural research has brought a\r\nshift of emphasis from production to utilization. In the United States\r\ntoday, each farmer produces enough food for himself and 25 other people.\r\nMoreover, for every person who works on a farm, there are two or three\r\nother people who sell him goods and services or process and distribute\r\nthe things he produces.\r\n\r\nIn agriculture, as in all areas of research, the number of questions to\r\nbe asked of Nature seems infinite. Future generations seeking to answer\r\nthese questions will probably rely more on techniques using radioactive\r\nisotopes than on any other methods known today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                How Are Radioisotopes Used in Research?\r\n\r\n\r\nThey May Be Used as “Tracers”\r\n\r\nMan’s attempts to describe the universe consist of finding answers to\r\nthe questions he puts to Nature:\r\n\r\n  How deep is a well? Toss in a rock.\r\n  Where is the cat? Hang a bell on him.\r\n  How far does a wild duck fly? Put a marker on his leg.\r\n  Where are the fireflies? Just watch at dusk.\r\n  Is our satellite still up? Listen for the radio signal.\r\n\r\nOther questions arise in agricultural research:\r\n\r\n  How fast do roots grow? How deep? How soon does water get to them\r\n              after a rain?\r\n  When does a mouthful of hay reach a cow’s stomach?\r\n  How long until nutrients get into her blood? Her milk?\r\n  How far will pine pollen travel on the wind?\r\n  How deep does an earthworm burrow?\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, scientists need some kind of miniature genie,\r\none who will shout at the proper moment, “I’m here!” When the root has\r\nreached the fertilizer or the water has reached the root; when the hay\r\nbecomes transmuted to milk, or the earthworm arrives at a particular\r\nspot—then this invisible little servant who has made the trip could\r\nannounce, “I’m here!”\r\n\r\nSuch a helpful genie exists as the radioactive atom: he is invisibly\r\nsmall, obedient, transportable, digestible, immune to fire, flood, or\r\nfamine, able to travel under his invisible cloak to the secret hiding\r\nplaces of Nature’s creatures and announce to waiting Geiger tubes, “I’m\r\nhere!”\r\n\r\nThe physically unstable radioactive atom behaves chemically exactly like\r\nits stable counterpart until the instant it emits its radiation and\r\nbecomes stable. For example, radioactive phosphorus behaves,\r\nbiologically and chemically, like stable phosphorus until it emits a\r\nbeta particle and becomes stable sulfur. If the beta particle enters a\r\ngas-filled Geiger tube, it produces a tiny burst of electrical energy\r\nwhich is registered by the counter.\r\n\r\nLike fireflies which reveal themselves at dusk by flashes of light,\r\nradioisotopes announce their numbers and locations to sensitive Geiger\r\ntubes by flashes of invisible “light.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Effective Are Radioactive Tracers?\r\n\r\nOne way to see how valuable radioactive tracers are is to compare them\r\nto standard chemical techniques. A sensitive chemical test can perceive\r\nmolecules as dilute as 10⁻⁷; that is, it can detect a molecule\r\nsurrounded by 10 million molecules of another kind. A good radioactive\r\ntracer technique, by comparison, can distinguish concentrations of\r\n10⁻¹¹; that is, it can trace one in 100 _billion_.\r\n\r\nIn other words by the chemical test you could find a person in\r\nmetropolitan New York with a secret tattoo on the roof of his mouth. By\r\nthe tracer method you could find this same person anywhere in the world,\r\neven if the world population were multiplied fiftyfold.\r\n\r\nIn the chemical test you could distinguish the equivalent of one kernel\r\nof corn in one-tenth of a boxcar load; in the tracer, one kernel in 850\r\nboxcars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Plant Nutrition and Metabolism\r\n\r\n\r\nMost studies of plant nutrition and metabolism pertain to the following\r\nquestions. What do plants need for their best growth? How do they take\r\nin the materials they need? What things are absorbed by roots and what\r\nthings by foliage? How does the plant turn water and other simple\r\ncompounds into carbohydrates and proteins?\r\n\r\nSpecific problems that atomic energy has helped to solve are listed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Happens to Fertilizer in the Soil?\r\n\r\nEarly research indicated that only 10 to 12 per cent of phosphorus\r\nfertilizers was taken up by plants in the first year; the rest was\r\n“locked into” the soil or washed away. With radioactive phosphorus-32\r\nscientists found that as much as 50 to 70 per cent of the phosphorus in\r\na plant came from the fertilizer during the first two or three weeks of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Plants Absorb Through Roots Only?\r\n\r\nFertilizer applied to soil is largely wasted because it is either bound\r\nby soil particles or is washed out of the root zone. If chemical\r\nelements could go directly into leaves and bypass the wastefulness of\r\nsoils, a tremendous saving would result.\r\n\r\nBotanists have learned in recent years that the foliage of plants can\r\ntake in some nutrients much as roots can. With tracers they discovered\r\nthat many nutrients are readily taken up by foliage, including bark of\r\ndormant trees, even at temperatures below freezing. As shown by isotopic\r\ntracers, elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium move both\r\nup and down from the point of application at rates similar to those\r\nfollowing root absorption. Urea (a nitrogen compound) is now used as a\r\nnutrient foliar spray for many fruit and vegetable crops in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere Should Fertilizer Be Placed?\r\n\r\nEven before the use of tracers, agronomists realized the inefficiency of\r\nspreading fertilizer uniformly over a seed-bed. They know the fertilizer\r\nshould be placed somewhere near the seed, but where? Above? Below?\r\nBeside? Below and beside? How far away? They had conducted some\r\nresearch, but the methods were slow and tedious.\r\n\r\nUsing tracers, the researchers confirmed earlier findings that roots\r\nwithin two or three days reached fertilizer placed less than two inches\r\ndirectly below seeds, but the roots tended to congregate there. When the\r\nfertilizer was two inches below and two inches to the side, roots\r\nreached it within a week and a better root system developed. With three\r\ninches between seeds and fertilizer, the desired seedling “boost” was\r\ndelayed three or four weeks. (See Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Fertilizers Move Fast in Plants?\r\n\r\nThe movement of radioactive phosphorus from root to leaf was found to be\r\nremarkably fast, sometimes requiring less than twenty minutes. (See Fig.\r\n2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Else Do Radioisotopes Tell Us?\r\n\r\nSome plants take in chemicals that the plant probably cannot use: for\r\nexample, the so-called locoweeds accumulate enormous amounts of\r\nselenium. With tracer techniques, we can see that the root uptake\r\nprocess has poor powers of discrimination.\r\n\r\nFig. 1—Soil tests tell _how much_ of each fertilizer element is needed\r\nbut not where to put it to give seedlings the much-needed “push.” With\r\ntracers it is found that:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (A) Fertilizer mixed throughout the soil gives the least\r\nbenefit to seedlings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (B) If placed in a band below and beside the seeds, the\r\nfertilizer gives high uptake and good root distribution.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (C) If the fertilizer is placed directly beneath the\r\nseeds, highest uptake occurs but roots tend to “bunch”—a handicap to\r\nlater growth.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2—Radioactive plant nutrients injected in soil roots\r\n\r\n[Illustration: have not reached above ground parts in 5 minutes]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: but have, as indicated by Geiger counter, reached these\r\nparts in 20 minutes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nTracer experiments reveal that roots cannot distinguish potassium\r\n(needed in large amounts) from other elements which are chemically\r\nsimilar but quite different in size. Once inside the plant, only\r\npotassium can be metabolized and similar but heavier elements (rubidium,\r\ncesium) are useless. This is like an absentminded builder who buys\r\nbrick, boulders, and gravel indiscriminately for his wall and then finds\r\nhe can use only part of his materials.\r\n\r\nThe process called photosynthesis whereby green plants use energy from\r\nthe sun to convert simple compounds from air and soil into complex,\r\nenergy-rich substances has been termed the most important chemical\r\nreaction in the world. It is the basis for man’s entire food supply and,\r\nexcept for nuclear energy, all significant fuel as well. Tracer\r\ntechniques have multiplied the research efforts on photosynthesis\r\ntremendously.\r\n\r\nWhen only chemical tests were available, food manufacturing in green\r\nleaves had to progress for hours before scientists could measure the\r\nproducts. But with tracers and other new techniques they have narrowed\r\nthe experimental time to minutes and finally to seconds. Today they know\r\nthat a green leaf has formed sugars more complex than fructose, “fruit\r\nsugar,” after exposure to light for only _one second_!\r\n\r\nWhen the incredible complexities of photosynthesis are finally\r\nunraveled, radioactive tracers, especially radioactive carbon-14, will\r\nhave provided the significant clues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Plant Diseases and Weeds\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can We Combat Plant Diseases?\r\n\r\nAt one time to stop epidemic spread of plant diseases was virtually\r\nimpossible; farmers had to abandon fields and crops. Such catastrophes\r\ncaused by microbes have changed the course of history. For example, the\r\nIrish famines of the 1840’s resulted from the potato blight and caused\r\nmass emigrations from Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn this country today plant diseases result in losses estimated at $3\r\nbillion a year. So far, the most economical means of reducing the\r\nravages of plant diseases has been to breed resistant plant varieties.\r\nAlthough such a variety may cost $100,000 to develop, its cost is\r\nusually repaid within a year or two.\r\n\r\nBut the victory is only temporary. Although plants are bred to resist\r\nthe pathogen (fungus) of the moment, Nature is constantly changing the\r\nmicrobial population by mutation and hybridization. Within a few years\r\nvirulent strains of fungi which can attack the “resistant” variety\r\nincrease to such an extent that the new variety must be replaced.\r\n\r\nFor crops that provide high per-acre income such as some vegetables and\r\nvine and tree fruits, chemical control of fungous diseases is\r\neconomically possible; in fact, it is a real necessity. But such\r\ntreatment is too costly for most field crops, unless some cheap seed\r\ntreatment or fertilizer additive can be found.\r\n\r\nA general breakthrough in control of plant diseases is yet to come.\r\nBecause of thousands of pathogenic species, with hundreds of strains, it\r\ndoes not seem possible that the following questions could be answered\r\nabout each one. What is the life cycle of the microbe? What conditions\r\nof temperature and humidity encourage it to spread? What plant species\r\ndoes it attack? How does it enter? What chemical changes within the\r\ncells of the plant determine whether they resist or succumb to the\r\ninvader? How long can germs remain potent? How far can they travel by\r\nwind or water? What combination of resistant varieties, cultural\r\nmethods, and chemical treatment will control the disease?\r\n\r\nWith tracers it is possible for the first time to measure chemical\r\nuptake in single spores and to follow chemicals through the plant.\r\nPerhaps the most enlightening information from such studies is that some\r\nfungicides are 10,000 times less effective per unit of “body weight”\r\nthan are other chemicals used to destroy weeds and insects. Obviously\r\nthe breakthrough in chemical control of plant diseases is yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Do Chemicals Destroy Some Plants?\r\n\r\nWeeds cost this country an estimated $5 billion annually, which is more\r\nthan the loss to either plant diseases or insects. Selective chemical\r\nweed killers such as “2, 4-D” have become so widely used that more than\r\n$135 million worth was sold in the United States in 1959. In proper\r\nconcentration these compounds will destroy many unwanted plants without\r\nharming lawn grasses or crop plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3—Tagged weed-killing chemicals (A) are taken in and\r\ntransported alike in grassy (B) and broad-leaved (C) plants, but only in\r\nthe latter are killed.]\r\n\r\nAs in many other instances, beneficial use of the chemicals has far\r\noutreached an understanding of how they work. The still scanty knowledge\r\nof the process has come almost entirely from tracer studies.\r\n\r\nAll plants readily absorb selective weed killers (“herbicides”), which\r\nare not destroyed within the plants. Resistant plants show no effect of\r\nthe chemicals, but sensitive plants suffer damage in actively growing\r\nroots and shoots. Sugar formation during photosynthesis is disrupted in\r\nthese plants, and phosphorus movement is retarded. In order to predict\r\nwhat new classes of chemicals might be of value as herbicides, we must\r\nawait the results of research using radioactive tracers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Animal Nutrition and Metabolism\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Nutritious Are Various Feedstuffs?\r\n\r\nAn endless phase of animal nutrition research deals with efficiency of\r\nrations, that is, the pounds gained by the animal per pound of feed\r\nconsumed. The standard form of such research is to feed groups of\r\nanimals on different rations for several weeks or months and determine\r\naverage change in weight per pound of feed used.\r\n\r\nIn recent years scientists have used chemical tests to compare the\r\namount of calcium in the diet against the amount excreted. The apparent\r\ndigestibility of such minerals has thus been computed for different\r\nrations. Yet one important source of error in these chemical tests\r\nplagued researchers.\r\n\r\nThere is a “turnover” in nutrients fed to animals; elements in feed are\r\nabsorbed into the animal’s body, retained for a time, and later\r\nexcreted. For example, a cow actually loses more calcium (through milk\r\nand excreta) during the first six months of milk production than her\r\nnormal ration contains. As long as the amount of recycling was unknown,\r\nscientists could not tell, for instance, how much calcium in alfalfa hay\r\ncould be digested by simply measuring incoming and outgoing calcium.\r\n\r\nFormerly scientists could study the problem only by withholding all\r\ncalcium from the diet. Under this unnatural condition all outgoing\r\ncalcium came from the animal’s body.\r\n\r\nWith radioactive calcium in a steer’s diet (or injected into the blood),\r\nscientists can quickly tell how much of the excreted calcium comes from\r\nthe animal’s blood and organs under normal conditions. In a typical\r\ninstance a ration thought to have 24 per cent digestible calcium,\r\nchemically determined, was found to have 38 per cent by the tracer\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\nThe tracer method shows that milk contains phosphorus, only 20 per cent\r\nof which may come from the feed and 80 per cent from the cow’s bones.\r\nWith eggs, about 65 per cent of the phosphorus is provided by feed and\r\n35 per cent by the hen. Radioactive tracers permit measurement of such\r\n“biological pathways,” as the biochemist calls them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Lean Meat be Estimated “on the Hoof”?\r\n\r\nThe proof of the ration, one might say, is in the cutting. That is, the\r\nworth of a particular feed was formerly unknown until the carcass had\r\nbeen cut and priced.\r\n\r\nBecause of the time and expense, researchers in the past have merely\r\ntested groups of animals on a ration for a few weeks and then estimated\r\nthe total gain by weighing and measuring. The main drawback to such a\r\nmethod is that it measures total growth only. In meat animals, knowing\r\ntotal growth is less important than knowing how much gain is in the more\r\nvaluable lean meat, how much is in fat, and how much merely water.\r\nTechniques based on atomic energy have provided a new approach without\r\nadding radioactive contamination to the animal.\r\n\r\nOf the “background radiation” that has existed since the earth was\r\nformed, part comes from cosmic rays (from outer space) and part from\r\nradioactive materials in the earth itself. One of these naturally\r\nradioactive isotopes is radioactive potassium, which is present to a\r\nsmall but significant extent in food, in human bodies, and in\r\nconstruction materials.\r\n\r\nWhile some chemicals such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen go into almost\r\nevery kind of substance in living things, potassium plays a special role\r\nin animals: it lodges almost exclusively, not in bone or fat or water,\r\nbut in lean meat.\r\n\r\nBiological and medical researchers are now cooperating to build\r\n“whole-body” radiation counters. A human being or an animal is actually\r\nenclosed by these huge devices, some of which are so sensitive they\r\nmeasure nearly every ray that emerges from the body. These counters will\r\nhelp answer many questions, but here only their use to measure\r\nradiopotassium in meat animals is explained. The animal is fed a test\r\nration containing no added radioactivity. At intervals of a week or\r\nmore, the animal is weighed and is also tested for natural\r\nradioactivity. Weighing tells total gain, while radiopotassium counting\r\nshows how much gain is in the desired lean meat. This method is\r\nremarkably simple, and since no radioactivity is added to its diet, the\r\nanimal can still be marketed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Thyroid Affect Milk—Egg Production?\r\n\r\nRecognition of the significance of the thyroid gland in animals, the\r\nassociation of iodine with the thyroid, and the availability of an\r\nexcellent radioisotope of iodine have resulted in increased study of\r\nthis important gland. Chemical tests had hinted at a link between the\r\nthyroid gland and the production of milk and eggs. Using radioactive\r\niodine, scientists learned that thyroid activity increases with the\r\nonset of milk and egg formation. In hot weather, when yield of milk and\r\neggs decreases, activity of the thyroid gland diminishes.\r\n\r\nIt may be that a dairy breeder can soon select calves for potential milk\r\nproduction because of thyroid activity as measured by radioactive\r\niodine. At present he must let the animals grow and produce milk for\r\nseveral years before he chooses those to use in herd improvement. (See\r\nFig. 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Tracers in Animal Nutrition Research\r\n\r\nFemale hormones in microgram amounts[1] accelerate fattening of cattle\r\nand sheep. Before this method can be used on animals for human\r\nconsumption, however, it must be determined that no possible human\r\ninjury can result from any residue. With chemical tests the measurement\r\nof such tiny amounts was impossible. Even with radioactive carbon-14,\r\ndoses of hormone 1000 times normal dosage were required before the\r\nhormones in the flesh were measurable.\r\n\r\nFig. 4—Future high-producing milk cows may be selected as calves,\r\nbecause of the measured activity of their thyroid glands. A minute\r\namount of iodine-131 is fed and within minutes has concentrated in the\r\nthyroid. High concentration means high thyroid activity, which in older\r\nanimals means high milk production.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: Iodine-131 fed ... concentrates in thyroid.]\r\n\r\nRecently an isotope of hydrogen (tritium or H³) was linked to hormones,\r\nand these were fed in normal amounts to cattle. Tests 90 days afterward\r\nshowed less than one part per billion in the meat, a big step toward\r\ncheaper fattening of meat animals with hormones.\r\n\r\nThe use of tranquilizers has been proposed for reducing the customary\r\nloss of weight in cattle being shipped to market. These chemicals, also,\r\nare used in such minute quantities that residues could not be detected\r\nexcept with radioactive tracers. Tritium can now be used by health\r\nofficials to study the effects of tranquilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Insects\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere and How Fast Do Insects Travel?\r\n\r\nRadioactive isotopes have been used to study insects, their life cycles,\r\ndispersion, mating and feeding habits, parasites, and predators. Several\r\nhundred such studies have been made on dozens of insect species.\r\n\r\nWith radioactive tracers even the smallest insect becomes more easily\r\nfollowed. As one example, nearly half a million mosquito larvae were\r\ntagged with radioactive phosphorus in Canada. Some of the adults from\r\nthese larvae were later found as far as seven miles away, but most were\r\nrecovered within one-eighth mile.\r\n\r\nIn a companion study grasshoppers were labeled with the same isotope.\r\nTheir average rate of movement was only twenty-one feet per hour, and\r\nafter seven days their position was based entirely on random motions\r\nplus prevailing winds. It seems that grasshoppers have no ability to\r\nmove toward food.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Far Do Insects Carry Pollen?\r\n\r\nThis question is of practical importance in knowing how far to separate\r\nseed-fields to maintain pure varieties of plants. In the past it was\r\nstudied by the laborious method of growing a plant having a dominant\r\n“marker” gene for some visible trait surrounded by plants without the\r\nmarker. Seeds from plants at various distances from the marked plant\r\nwere grown the following year to see how far the genetically marked\r\npollen had been carried. Since such plants are normally cross\r\npollinated, it was difficult to obtain strains genetically pure for\r\npresence or absence of the marker gene. Also, considerable testing and\r\nbookkeeping were involved.\r\n\r\nWith tracers the answer may be found in a few days. A plant is injected\r\nwith radioactive phosphorus; after a few days its pollen is highly\r\nradioactive. Flowers at various distances from the tagged plant may be\r\nchecked daily for radioactivity. In one study with alfalfa, radioactive\r\npollen was carried as far as thirty feet by bees, but more than\r\none-third was deposited on plants adjacent to the labeled one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre Predators Used to Destroy Insects?\r\n\r\nWith insect pests, as with plant diseases, biological control is more\r\neconomical than artificial control. The use of insecticides too often\r\nresults in destruction of helpful insects along with pests. Limited\r\nsuccess has been achieved in breeding certain plants for resistance to\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nTwo important uses of biological control in agriculture have been made\r\nin recent years: importing an insect from Australia to eradicate a weed\r\nin California and disseminating ladybird beetles to control certain\r\nscale insects.\r\n\r\nFig. 5—Identifying predators that destroy unwanted insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aphids are made radioactive.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larger insects found nearby are checked for\r\nradioactivity.]\r\n\r\nBumblebee has not eaten radioactive aphids, but mantis has.\r\n\r\nHelpful parasites and predators must first be identified before they can\r\nbe used. In the case of small or nocturnal insects, this can be\r\nexceedingly troublesome. Tagging the pests with radioisotopes in order\r\nto identify the predators which consume them is much simpler because the\r\nmost efficient predators contain the most activity.\r\n\r\nWith such techniques entomologists have studied insects and animals\r\nwhich prey on unwanted aphids, mosquitoes, blackflies, and roaches. Such\r\nexperiments may lead to a deliberate increase of certain predators to\r\ncontrol injurious insects.\r\n\r\nRadioactive labeling is also valuable in studying helpful insects. In\r\none case the indolence of drone bees was indicated by finding that even\r\nwith adequate syrup in their cage they still received identical syrup\r\nfrom worker bees in an adjoining cage!\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Tracers Measure Spray Residues?\r\n\r\nAny material used on plants or animals to kill insects or disease\r\norganisms must pass rigid inspection to be sure it does not accumulate\r\nin foodstuffs. This is particularly true of the “systemic” poisons,\r\nthose which are fed to plants via leaves or roots and are carried\r\ninternally to all parts of the plant. Such chemicals can be used widely\r\nwith nonfood plants such as cotton to kill insects feeding on them.\r\n\r\nCombining radioactive labeling with other techniques has permitted the\r\nresearchers to show that some compounds are soon broken down into\r\nharmless chemicals—a big step toward acceptance for their use on food\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Radioisotopes as Radiation Sources\r\n\r\n\r\nEarlier in this booklet radioisotopes were compared to fireflies because\r\nthey emit flashes of “light.” Isotopes serve research in another\r\nimportant way, other than as tracers.\r\n\r\nSuppose you collected all the fireflies within a 100-mile radius and put\r\nthem into a glass jar. Instead of an occasional twinkle, you would now\r\nhave a steady glow of light. Similarly immense numbers of radioactive\r\natoms can be compressed into a small volume to produce steady, intense\r\nsources of radiation. Agricultural research has answered many questions\r\nwith the use of such radiation sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Radiation Produce New Plants?\r\n\r\nPerhaps no biological aspect of atomic energy has so caught the fancy of\r\nthe public as the prospect of creating new plant varieties. There is\r\nsomething mysterious about pouring invisible energy into seeds or buds\r\nand watching for changes in the emerging leaves and flowers. There is\r\nalso the challenge of the lottery in being unable to predict where,\r\nwhen, or in what form the alterations will appear.\r\n\r\nAlthough the claims of over-enthusiastic gardeners and seed dealers\r\nabout astonishing new plants “created” by atomic radiation are doubted,\r\nclear proof exists even in the restrained scientific journals of\r\nhereditary changes caused by radiation.\r\n\r\nFrom more than 30 years of scientific study, certain conclusions have\r\nemerged. High-energy radiations can cause sudden hereditary changes\r\n(mutations) in any living thing: man, animal, microbe, or plant. Any\r\nfeature of a plant subject to hereditary control—root, shoot, leaf,\r\nflower, or fruit—can be altered by radiation. Most of these changes are\r\nundesirable; they interfere with the normal state of biological affairs.\r\nA very small percentage of mutated organisms is improved in some way. So\r\nfar changes cannot be controlled or predicted.\r\n\r\nTo date fourteen new strains of crop plants improved by radiation have\r\nbeen put into production in various parts of the world. These varieties\r\nwith their places and dates of release follow:\r\n\r\n  1. “Primex” white mustard, Sweden, 1950\r\n  2. “Chlorina Mutant” tobacco, Indonesia, about 1950\r\n  3. “Shafer’s Universal” bean, Germany, about 1950\r\n  4. “Regina II” summer oil rape, Sweden, 1953\r\n  5. “Weibull Stralart” fodder pea, Sweden, 1957\r\n  6. “Sanilac” navy bean, Michigan, 1957\r\n  7. “Pallas” barley, Sweden, 1958\r\n  8. “N. C. 4X” peanut, North Carolina, 1959\r\n  9. “Florad” oats, Florida, 1960\r\n  10. “Seaway” bean, Michigan, 1960\r\n  11. “Alamo-X” oats, Texas, 1961\r\n  12. “Gratiot” bean, Michigan, 1963\r\n  13. “Pennrad” barley, Pennsylvania, 1963\r\n  14. “Yukon-1” carnation, Connecticut, 1963\r\n\r\nIn these instances no desirable changes appeared in the plant grown\r\ndirectly from treated seeds, but they appeared several generations\r\nlater. In most cases hundreds of thousands of plants were examined\r\nbefore the desirable ones were found. The desired changes were almost\r\nalways accompanied by undesirable ones, and years of cross-breeding and\r\n“purifying” were necessary to obtain usable varieties.\r\n\r\nThe technique of radiation breeding can be used on any form of life\r\nwhere large numbers can be grown and discarded at little cost. The\r\noutput of penicillin has been increased a thousandfold by repeated\r\nmutations caused in the microorganism producing this antibiotic. Several\r\nstudies on radiation breeding of poultry have been started.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious reverse twist of induced mutation is being applied in the\r\nfield of plant diseases. While some scientists are irradiating seeds and\r\nplants in an effort to obtain disease-resistant mutations, others are\r\nirradiating the fungi which cause the diseases. They hope in this way to\r\nforesee the new strains of pathogenic microbes that will occur naturally\r\nin order to breed resistant plants before the new diseases appear.\r\n\r\nSome claims have been made that radiation can stimulate plant growth,\r\ngermination, earlier maturity, and so on. Similar benefits are sometimes\r\nclaimed for human health. These allegations are almost never proved in\r\nreputable laboratories. It seems likely that radiation is stimulating,\r\nin the words of one authority, “only in the sense that a pruning knife\r\nis stimulating.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCan Radiation Destroy Germs and Insects?\r\n\r\nFood technologists have studied ways of preserving food with radiation\r\nfor more than ten years. Their findings indicate that complete\r\nsterilization of food with radiation requires doses so high (2 to 6\r\nmillion roentgens[2]) that cost is prohibitive at present, and the food\r\noften becomes distasteful. These amounts of energy completely destroy\r\nthe microbes and enzymes which normally cause food to putrefy.\r\n\r\nIf radiation is to be used in preserving food, it will probably be as a\r\nsupplement to conventional methods of heating and freezing.\r\n“Pasteurizing” with radiation to destroy most (but not all) of the\r\nmicrobes in meat or fruit or vegetables is accomplished with less than\r\nfive per cent of the dosage required for sterilizing. Such treatment\r\ndoes not alter flavor or texture appreciably and could be used to\r\nprolong the refrigerated “life” of many fresh foods. It is the\r\nresponsibility of the Federal Food and Drug Administration to determine\r\nthat no threat to human welfare could possibly result before approving\r\nthe use of high-energy radiation to preserve foods.\r\n\r\nWith agricultural products stored dry, such as grain, tobacco, and wool,\r\nthe chief agents of damage are not microbes, but insects. The loss of\r\nstored field crops caused by insects is estimated at $200 million\r\nannually in the United States. Deinfesting such goods with radiation\r\ndoses in the “pasteurizing” range promises to be practical and causes no\r\napparent change in the product.\r\n\r\nLike many other foodstuffs, potatoes are often stored for months between\r\nharvest and use. Precaution must be taken to prevent their deterioration\r\nduring storage not only from decay but also from sprouting.\r\n\r\nCold storage inhibits sprouting but is costly and has another serious\r\ndrawback. In the making of potato chips, tubers held at low temperature\r\ncontain excess sugar and result in darkened chips. Storage at higher\r\ntemperatures prevents conversion of starch to sugar but encourages\r\nsprouting.\r\n\r\nAtomic energy promises to resolve this dilemma. Given low doses of gamma\r\nrays (5000 to 10,000 roentgens), potatoes may be kept at room\r\ntemperature for a year or more without sprouting. Similar doses inhibit\r\nsprouting of onions. The estimated cost of irradiating tubers and bulbs\r\nat such doses is as low as 14 cents per ton. No chemical changes have\r\nyet been found in irradiated potatoes that would make them unsafe for\r\neating. In fact, health officials in Canada have recently approved the\r\nuse of gamma rays on potato tubers that will be stored and later used\r\nfor human food. Our own Food and Drug Administration has given similar\r\napproval for applying gamma rays to bacon and fast electrons to wheat\r\n(for killing insects).\r\n\r\nAn ingenious application of atomic energy to agriculture concerns the\r\nscrewworm fly, which inhabits large areas of southern United States,\r\nMexico, and the Caribbean. The fly lays eggs in open wounds of\r\nlivestock, including navels of newly born, and the burrowing maggots\r\ninevitably kill the animal. In the southeastern United States, damage\r\nfrom this insect amounted to $15 to $25 million annually.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1958 and 1959 more than two billion screwworm flies were\r\ndeliberately released from airplanes over the entire state of Florida\r\nand parts of Georgia and Alabama. This astonishing act was a major step\r\nin successful eradication of the pest from southeastern United States.\r\n\r\nThe entomologists who conceived this remarkable scheme had the following\r\ninformation from basic studies: the insect produces a generation about\r\nevery three weeks. In the pupal stage males can be sterilized by 2500\r\nroentgens of X or gamma rays, females by 5000 roentgens. The insect can\r\nbe reared in large numbers. Sterile males are fully competitive with\r\nnormal males for mates. And, of course, sterile eggs do not hatch. (It\r\nwas helpful, though incidental, that females mate only once.)\r\n\r\nAfter initial tests on an island in the Caribbean, a large fly-producing\r\nplant was set up. Flies were grown to the pupal stage, irradiated with\r\n8000 roentgens of gamma rays, permitted to mature, and released from\r\nairplanes. With 50 million flies being released weekly over Florida,\r\nGeorgia, and Alabama, the area was smothered with sterile flies, and the\r\nnumber of eggs that hatched (from the normal native flies) rapidly\r\ndiminished to zero. The program was continued for 18 months, and in this\r\ntime the insect was completely eliminated.\r\n\r\nCertain other insects are being considered for the sterility-eradication\r\ntechnique. Among them are the boll weevil, European corn borer,\r\nmosquito, and tsetse fly. Oriental scientists are using gamma rays\r\ninstead of the conventional heating to kill silkworms inside cocoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Does Radiation Affect Farm Animals?\r\n\r\nAt a few colleges of agriculture in this country, radiation effects on\r\nfarm animals are being studied.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not be flattering to be likened to a pig or a donkey,\r\nthe fact remains that human beings are physiologically very similar to\r\nswine and burros. These animals are mammals with simple stomachs and\r\nhave the same general size, shape, and placement of organs as do humans.\r\nRadiation studies with swine and burros, although slow and expensive,\r\nshould give information more applicable to humans than the more rapid\r\nand inexpensive studies with small laboratory animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Else Can Radiation Tell Us?\r\n\r\nTwo characteristics of soils besides fertility are vitally important and\r\ndifficult to measure. These characteristics are moisture and density.\r\nMoisture must be determined frequently for efficient irrigation. Density\r\ncontrols the pore space available for water and oxygen; the possible\r\ndamage to the soil from tillage and harvesting machines is revealed by\r\nbefore-and-after tests of density.\r\n\r\nBoth soil moisture and density were formerly determined by laboratory\r\nmethods, which had two drawbacks: the methods were laborious, and they\r\ntested soil in an unnatural state. Today a sort of double-barreled\r\nradiation method can be used to measure these two soil characteristics.\r\n\r\nNeutrons are readily scattered by water but not by soil; gamma rays are\r\nabsorbed by both soil and water. In practice the experimenter drills two\r\nholes in the soil a few feet apart. Into one he puts a gamma-ray source;\r\ninto the other, a radiation detector. The reading on his detector dial\r\ntells him the amount of gamma rays absorbed by both soil and water.\r\nReplacing the gamma-ray source with a neutron source, he obtains a\r\nreading on absorption by water only. The difference between the two\r\nreadings is ascribed to the density, or degree of compaction, of that\r\nsoil in its native state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nRadioactive tracers and radiation sources have become indispensable to\r\nall phases of agricultural research. They have helped answer questions\r\nthat seemed unanswerable. But there will always be more questions to put\r\nto Nature. The physicists-philosophers of 1890 were confident that they\r\nhad obtained all significant knowledge of the physical universe.\r\nDiscoveries of the next twenty years revealed the immaturity of that\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe modern poet Archibald MacLeish has dramatized the meagerness of\r\nknowledge:[3]\r\n\r\n  I will tell you all we have learned ...\r\n    the lights in the sky are stars\r\n  We think they do not see\r\n    we think also\r\n  The trees do not know nor the leaves of the grasses hear us....\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most characteristic realization of the scientist today is\r\nthat the universe is too complex to be fully described, that concepts\r\nmust change repeatedly to absorb new findings, and that the recurring\r\nmiracle of life is more majestic than any formula, any computer, or any\r\nrocket that man’s brain can devise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Suggested References\r\n\r\n\r\n_Applications of Radioisotopes and Radiation in the Life Sciences._\r\n  Hearings before the Subcommittee on Research, Development and\r\n  Radiation of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Congress of the\r\n  United States, March 27-30, 1961.
