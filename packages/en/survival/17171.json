There are apparently two different\r\nages of them. Mostly about 2 pounds in weight (about as long as a large\r\nmackerel) and about one-half as many weighing from 6 to 8 pounds;\r\noccasionally one larger. One last week weighed 33 pounds and one 18\r\npounds. The fishermen think they are the young of those with which some\r\nof our rivers have been stocked, as nothing of the kind has occurred in\r\npast years at all like this.\r\n\r\nJOHN H.

The run was about the two first weeks in May\r\nand a few the last of April. Mr. Bassett had about 30 to 35 from the\r\ntrap at Menimpsha, and 10 or 12 from Sconticut Neck, the mouth of our\r\nriver. Mr. Bartlett, at his fish market, had about one dozen; 12 from\r\nthe traps near the mouth of Slocum's River, six miles west of here, and\r\nI have heard of two taken at mouth of Westport River.\r\n\r\nAs to the particular species, I do not get any reliable information, as\r\nso few of our fishermen know anything about salmon, and in fact the men\r\nfrom the traps on Sconticut Neck did not know what the fish were.\r\n\r\nJOHN H.

[Extracts.]\r\n\r\nDEAR PROFESSOR: We have had a great run of salmon this year, and\r\nconsisting largely of fish planted by us in the Penobscot four or five\r\nyears ago, so far as we could judge; there were a very large number,\r\nrunning from 9 to 12 pounds. The east and west branches of the Penobscot\r\nreport a great many fish in the river. On the Mattawamkeag where we\r\nput in 250,000 and upwards, in 1875 and 1876, a great many salmon\r\nare reported trying to get over the lower dam at Gordon's Falls,\r\n13 feet high. These fish were put in at Bancroft, Eaton and Kingman, on\r\nthe European and North American Railroad. The dam at Kingham is 13 feet;\r\nat Slewgundy, 14 feet; at Gordon's Falls, 13 feet and yet a salmon has\r\nbeen hooked on a trout fly at Bancroft and salmon are seen in the river\r\nat Kingman, and between the dams at Slewgundy and Gordon's Falls. The\r\ndealers in our city have retailed this season 50 tons Penobscot salmon,\r\nand about 3 tons Saint John salmon; it all sells as Penobscot salmon.\r\nSaint John salmon costs here, duty and all included, about 14 cents per\r\npound. Our first salmon sells at $1 per pound, and so on down to 12 1/2\r\ncents the last of the season.'\r\n\r\nSalmon at Bucksport has sold to dealers here at 8 cents. Two tons taken\r\nat Bucksport and Orland in 24 hours. Average price at retail here for\r\nwhole season, 25 cents.\r\n\r\nTruly, yours,\r\n\r\nE. M. Stillwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES,\r\nBangor, October 4, 1879.\r\n\r\nDEAR PROFESSOR: My delay in replying to your kind letter has been from\r\nno want of courtesy, but a desire to send you the required \"data\" you\r\nasked. Neither myself nor Mr. Atkins have been able to procure them. The\r\nweir fishermen keep no records at all, and it is difficult to obtain\r\nfrom them anything reliable; while the fishermen above tidewater are a\r\nbad set of confirmed poachers, whose only occupation is hunting and\r\nfishing both in and out of season. They are always jealous and loth to\r\nlet us know how good a thing they make of it, for fear of us and fear of\r\ncompetition from their own class.\r\n\r\nFour or five years since I put in some 300,000 salmon fry into the\r\nMattawamkeag at Bancroft, Eaton, Kingsmore, and at Mattawamkeag village.\r\nThere are three dams between Mattawamkeag and Bancroft--none less than\r\n12 feet high. About six weeks since Mr. Nathaniel Sweat, a railroad\r\nconductor on the European and North American Railroad, while fishing for\r\ntrout from a pier above the railroad bridge at Bancroft, hooked a large\r\nsalmon and lost his line and flies. Salmon in great numbers have been\r\ncontinually jumping below the first dam, which is called \"Gordon's\r\nFalls.\"\r\n\r\nMy colleague, Everett Smith, of Portland, a civil engineer, while making\r\na survey for a fishway, counted 15 salmon jumping in 30 minutes. A Mr.\r\nBailey, who is foreman of the repair shop at Mattawamkeag walked up to\r\nthe falls some three weeks since entirely out of curiosity excited by\r\nthe rumors of the sight, and counted 60 salmon jumping in about an hour,\r\nwithin half or three-quarters of a mile of the falls. This is on the\r\nMattawamkeag, which is a great tributary of the Penobscot.\r\n\r\nOn the east branch of the Penobscot there has been a great run of\r\nsalmon. An explorer on the Wassattaquoik reported the pools literally\r\nblack with salmon. A party of poachers, hearing the rumor, went in from\r\nthe town of Hodgon and killed 25. I inclose you a letter to me from Mr.\r\nPrentiss, one of our most wealthy and prominent merchants, which speaks\r\nfor itself: I will be obliged to you if you will return this, as I shall\r\nhave occasion to use it in my report.\r\n\r\nOn the West branch of the Penobscot I hear reports of large numbers of\r\nsalmon, but the breaking of the two great dams at Chesancook and the\r\nNorth Twin Dam, which holds back the great magazine of water of the\r\ngreat tributary lakes which feed the Penobscot, which is used to drive\r\nthe logs cut in the winter, through the summer's drought, has let up all\r\nthe fish which hitherto were held back until the opening of the gates to\r\nlet the logs through. These fish would not, of course, be seen, as they\r\nwould silently make their way up.\r\n\r\nI regret that I have nothing of more value to give you. Hoping that this\r\nsmall contribution may at least cheer you as it has me,\r\n\r\nI remain, truly, yours,\r\n\r\nE. M. STILWELL, Commissioner of Fisheries for State of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. SPENCER F. BAIRD,\r\nUnited States Commissioner Fish and Fisheries.\r\nBANGOR, October 3, 1879.\r\n\r\nM. STILWELL, Esq.,\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: Prof. C. E. Hamlin of Harvard, and I made a trip to Mount\r\nKatahdin last month for scientific examination and survey of the\r\nmountain. I had been salmon fishing in July on the Grand Bonaventure, on\r\nBay of Chaleur, and I could not see why we could not catch salmon on the\r\neast branch of the Penobscot at the Hunt place where we crossed it on\r\nour way in to Katahdin. I thought the pool from mouth of Wassatiquoik to\r\nthe Hunt place, about a half-mile, must be an excellent salmon pool, and\r\nmy guide and the people there confirmed this opinion. They said over a\r\nhundred salmon had been taken in that one pool this season. The nearest\r\nsettlement, and only one on the whole east branch, is about six miles\r\nout from there, and the young men go on Sundays and fish with\r\ndrift-nets. No regular fishing for market--only a backwoods local supply\r\ncan be used. These fish were about of one size--say 8 to 11 pounds.\r\n\r\nThere were never enough fish here before to make it worth while for them\r\nto drift for them. A few years ago no salmon were caught there at all.\r\nTwenty-two years ago, before our fish laws were enacted, the farmer at\r\nthe Hunt place used to have a net that went entirely across the river\r\nclear to the bottom, which he kept all the time stretched across, and he\r\nonly used to get two or three salmon a week. I was there August, 1857,\r\nwith Mr. Joseph Carr, an old salmon fisher, and we fished for ten days\r\nand could not get a rise. The net had been taken up, because the farmer\r\ndid not get fish enough to pay for looking after it.\r\n\r\nBut the stocking the river makes it good fishing and I intend to try the\r\neast branch next season with the fly.\r\n\r\nVery truly,\r\n\r\nHENRY M. PRENTISS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 13, 1879\r\nEast Windsor Hill, Conn.\r\n\r\nProfessor BAIRD:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: It may be of interest to you to know that your salmon are not\r\nall lost. Last Friday, 10th, I was with a party of three fishing in\r\nSnipsic Lake, and one of our party caught a salmon that weighed 1 3/4\r\npounds. This is the second one taken since the pond was stocked as I was\r\ntold. The other was caught this summer and weighed 12 ounces.\r\n\r\nCannot something be done to save our fish in Connecticut River? There is\r\nan establishment at Holyoke, Mass., and another at Windsor Locks, Conn.,\r\nthat are manufacturing logs into paper, and I am told that the chemicals\r\nused for that purpose are let off into the river twice a day, and that\r\nthe fish for half a mile come up as though they had been cockled.\r\n\r\nBoth of these factories are at the foot of falls where the fish collect\r\nand stop in great numbers and are all killed. Our shores and sand-bars\r\nare literally lined with dead fish. Three salmon have been found among\r\nthem within two miles of my office. They were judged to weigh 12, 20 and\r\n25 pounds. The dead fish are so numerous that eagles are here after\r\nthem. I have received nine that have been shot here in the past two\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nI have written you in order that the fish commissioners might stop this\r\nnuisance and save the fish that they have taken so much pains to\r\npropagate.\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\nWm Hood, East Windsor Hill, Conn., October 13, 1879\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT STEPHEN, March 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nProf. SPENCER F. BAIRD\r\nU. S. Commissioner Fish and Fisheries:\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I send you remarks in relation to the Restigouche and Saint\r\nCroix Rivers, which, though crude, I am sure are quite correct, as they\r\nare either taken from the official statistics, or are facts of which I\r\nam myself cognizant. You may, if of use, publish any part of them.\r\n\r\nI very much wish we could procure some young shad for the Saint Croix;\r\nthis fish was once very abundant, and perhaps would be again if\r\nintroduced. I know you have been very successful in restocking the\r\nConnecticut. Our old people deplore the loss of the shad--say it was a\r\nmuch better food-fish than the salmon. I do a great deal of shooting,\r\nand am much interested in ornithology, and specimens of our birds that\r\nyou might want I should be happy to lookout for; do a good deal of coast\r\nshooting winters; have been hopefully looking for a Labrador duck for a\r\nnumber of seasons--fear they have totally disappeared.\r\n\r\nI have nice spring-water conducted to my house and think of doing a\r\nlittle fish-hatching in a small way. The amount of water I can spare is\r\na stream of about half inch diameter; the force will be considerable, as\r\nthe water rises to top of my house, some 50 feet above where I should\r\nset trays. I write to you to ask what hatching apparatus would be best\r\nto get, where to buy, and probable cost. I am trying to get some\r\nsea-trout ova to hatch in it. I presume all your California ova have\r\nbeen disposed of ere this.\r\n\r\nFRANK TODD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT STEPHEN, March 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nProf SPENCER F. BAIRD, U. S. Commissioner Fish and Fisheries:\r\n\r\nSIR: In regard to the Saint Croix, would say, that it was once one of\r\nthe most prolific salmon rivers in New Brunswick, but owing to the\r\nerection of impassable dams, fifteen or twenty years ago, this valuable\r\nfish had almost entirely disappeared. At about this time fishways were\r\nplaced in all the dams, and gradually salmon began to increase, but the\r\nfirst great stimulus was given some ten years ago by the distribution of\r\nsome hundreds of thousands of young salmon in the headwaters, by the\r\nfishery commissioners of Maine.\r\n\r\nThe Dobsis Club also placed in the Saint Croix some 200,000 or more from\r\ntheir hatchery, a portion being the California salmon. With these\r\nexceptions our river has had no artificial aid, but for the last five\r\nyears the number of salmon has largely increased, due mainly, no doubt,\r\nto the deposits before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe fish ways are generally in good condition (although some\r\nimprovements will be made), and fish have easy access to headwaters,\r\nThat large numbers go up and spawn is evidenced by the large numbers of\r\nsmolt seen at the head of tidal water in the spring, many being taken by\r\nboys with the rod. I have reason to expect that our government will\r\nhereafter distribute annually in the Saint Croix a goodly number of\r\nyoung salmon which, together with the contributions of the Maine\r\ncommissioners will soon make this fish again abundant. Alewives are very\r\nabundant and apparently increasing every year. Shad that were once\r\nplenty have entirely disappeared. I very much wish that the river could\r\nbe stocked with this valuable fish; possibly you could kindly assist us\r\nin this.\r\n\r\nLandlocked salmon (here so called) are, I think, nearly or quite as\r\nplenty at Grand Lake Stream as they were ten years ago; this, I think,\r\nis almost entirely due to the hatchery under the charge of Mr. Atkins;\r\nthe tannery at the head of the stream having entirely destroyed their\r\nnatural spawning beds, the deposit of hair and other refuse being in\r\nsome places inches deep. The twenty-five per cent. of all fish hatched,\r\nwhich are honestly returned to our river, is, I think, each year more\r\nthan we would get by the natural process, under present circumstances,\r\nin ten years.\r\n\r\nFRANK TODD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT STEPHEN, N. B., DOMINION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nProf. SPENCER F. BAIRD, U. S. Commissioner Fish and Fisheries:\r\n\r\nSIR: I think it has been clearly demonstrated in this Dominion that by\r\nartificial propagation and a fair amount of protection, all natural\r\nsalmon rivers may be kept thoroughly stocked with this fish, and rivers\r\nthat have been depleted, through any cause, brought back to their former\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nI would instance the river Restigouche in support of the above\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nThis river, which empties into the Bay of Chaleur, is now, and always\r\nhas been, the foremost salmon river in New Brunswick, both as to size\r\nand number of fish. It has not a dam or obstruction to the free passage\r\nof fish from its mouth to its source, yet up to 1868 and 1869 the\r\nnumbers of salmon had constantly decreased. This, no doubt, was\r\noccasioned by excessive netting at the mouth, and spearing the fish\r\nduring the summer in the pools; natural production was not able to keep\r\nup with this waste.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1868 the number of salmon was so small that the total catch\r\nby anglers was only 20 salmon, and the commercial yield only 37,000\r\npounds. At about this date, the first salmon hatchery of the Dominion\r\nwas built upon this river and a better system of protection inaugurated;\r\nevery year since some hundreds of thousands of young salmon have been\r\nhatched and placed in these waters, and the result has been, that in\r\n1878 one angler alone (out of hundreds that were fishing the river)\r\nin sixteen days killed by his own rod eighty salmon, seventy-five of\r\nwhich averaged over twenty-six pounds each; while at the same time the\r\nnumbers that were being taken by the net fishermen below, for commercial\r\npurposes, were beyond precedent, amounting in that one division alone\r\n(not counting local and home consumption) to the enormous weight of\r\n500,000 pounds, and the cash receipts for salmon in Restigouche County\r\nthat year amounted to more than $40,000, besides which some $5,000 was\r\nexpended by anglers; this result was almost entirely brought about by\r\nartificial propagation. A new hatchery of size sufficient to produce\r\nfive million young fish annually will no doubt soon be erected by the\r\nDominion Government upon this river.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar record might be given of the river Saguenay. Some\r\nyears ago anglers and net fishers of this river said it was useless to\r\nlease from the department, as the scarcity of salmon was such as not to\r\nwarrant the outlay. A hatchery was built, and this state of things is\r\nnow wonderfully changed; so much so, indeed, that in 1878 salmon, from\r\nthe great numbers which were taken at the tidal fisheries, became a drug\r\nin the market, selling often as low as three cents per pound, and\r\nangling in the tributaries was most excellent.\r\n\r\nSome one hundred million young salmon have been artificially hatched and\r\ndistributed in the waters of the Dominion during the last few years, and\r\nnew government hatcheries are constantly being erected.\r\n\r\nYours, &c.,\r\n\r\nFRANK TODD, Fishery Overseer, Saint Croix District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE II\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE PENOBSCOT SALMON-BREEDING ESTABLISHMENT\r\n\r\nby\r\n\r\nCharles G. Atkins\r\n\r\nWritten by request of Prof. S. F. Baird, for the London Exhibition,\r\n1883\r\n\r\n_Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission_, Vol. 3, Page 373, 1883\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rivers of the United States tributary to the Atlantic, north of the\r\nHudson, were, in their natural state, the resorts of the migratory\r\nsalmon, _Salmo salar_, and most of them continued to support important\r\nfisheries for this species down to recent times. The occupation of the\r\ncountry by Europeans introduced a new set of antagonistic forces which\r\nbegan even in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to operate\r\nagainst the natural increase and maintenance of the salmon and other\r\nmigratory fishes.\r\n\r\nIn many localities the closing of smaller streams by dams, and the\r\npursuit of the fish with nets and other implements, had already begun\r\nto tell on their number; but it was not until the present century that\r\nthe industrial activities of the country began to seize upon the water\r\npower of the larger rivers and to interrupt in them by lofty dams the\r\nascent of salmon to their principal spawning grounds. These forces were\r\nrapid in their operations, aided as they were by a greatly augmented\r\ndemand for food from a rapidly increasing population.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the salmon fisheries were extinct in all but five or six of the\r\nthirty rivers known to have been originally inhabited by them. In many\r\nof these rivers the last salmon had been taken, and in others the\r\noccurrence of individual specimens was extremely rare. Among the\r\nexhausted rivers may be mentioned the Connecticut, 380 miles long; the\r\nMerrimack,180 miles long; the Saco,120 miles long; the Androscoggin,\r\n220 miles long; and some twenty smaller rivers. There still survived\r\nsalmon fisheries in the following rivers, namely, the Penobscot, the\r\nKennebec, the Denny's, the East Machias, the Saint Croix, and the\r\nAroostook, a tributary of the Saint John. The most productive of these\r\nwas the Penobscot, yielding 5,000 to 10,000 salmon yearly. The Kennebec\r\noccasionally yielded 1,200 in a year, but generally much less. The\r\nother rivers were still less productive.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the re-establishment of these fisheries originated in\r\naction of the legislature of New Hampshire, seconded by that of the\r\nneighboring state of Massachusetts, having in view primarily the\r\nfisheries of the Merrimack and Connecticut Rivers. The course of the\r\nMerrimack lies wholly within the states of New Hampshire and\r\nMassachusetts; that of the Connecticut lies partly in the state of\r\nConnecticut, and many of its tributaries are in the state of Vermont.\r\nThese two states were therefore early interested in the project, and\r\ntheir action soon led to similar exertions on the part of Rhode Island\r\nand Maine. Within the borders of the six states mentioned, collectively\r\nknown as \"New England,\" are all of the rivers of the United States\r\nknown to have been frequented by the sea-going _Salmo salar_, with the\r\npossible exception of certain rivers, tributary to the Saint Lawrence,\r\nin the northern part of New York.\r\n\r\nThe governments of these states having appointed boards of\r\ncommissioners to whom was confided the task of restocking the exhausted\r\nrivers, other states, one after another, adopted like measures, and in\r\n1872 the United States Government established a commission to inquire\r\ninto the condition and needs of the fisheries in general, with\r\nauthority to take steps for the propagation of food fishes.\r\n\r\nThe New England commissioners turned their attention at once to the two\r\nmost important of their migratory fishes, the salmon and the shad. The\r\nutter extermination of salmon from most of their rivers compelled them\r\nto consider the best mode of introducing them from abroad.\r\n\r\nAgents were sent to the rivers of Canada, where for several years they\r\nwere permitted to take salmon from their spawning beds, and some\r\nhundreds of thousands of salmon eggs were thus obtained and hatched\r\nwith a measure of success. After a few seasons permits for such\r\noperations were discontinued, and the only foreign source of supply\r\nthereafter remaining open to the states was found in the breeding\r\nestablishments under control of the Canadian Government, and even these\r\nwere practically closed by the high price at which the eggs were\r\nvalued.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 it had become clear that to a continuation of efforts it was\r\nessential that a new supply of salmon ova should be discovered.\r\nAttention was now directed to the Penobscot River in the state of\r\nMaine, which, though very unproductive compared with Canadian rivers,\r\nmight yet, perhaps, be made to yield the requisite quantity of spawn.\r\n\r\nA preliminary examination of the river brought out the following facts:\r\nThe Penobscot is about 225 miles in length. The upper half of its\r\ncourse and nearly all of its principal tributaries lie in an\r\nuninhabited wilderness, and in this district are the breeding grounds\r\nof the salmon. The fisheries, however, are all on the lower part of the\r\nriver and in the estuary into which it empties, Penobscot Bay. There\r\nwas no means of knowing how great a proportion of the salmon entering\r\nthis river succeeded in passing safely the traps and nets set to\r\nintercept them, but supposing half of them to escape capture there\r\nwould still be but about 6,000 fish of both sexes scattered through the\r\nhundreds of miles of rivers and streams forming the headwaters of the\r\nPenobscot.\r\n\r\nIt was very doubtful whether they would be congregated about any one\r\nspot in sufficient numbers to supply a breeding station, and it would\r\nbe impracticable to occupy any widely extended part of the river, on\r\naccount of the difficulties of communication. At the mouth of the\r\nriver, on the other hand, the supply of adult salmon could be found\r\nwith certainty, but they must be obtained from the ordinary salmon\r\nfisheries in June and held in durance until October or November, and\r\nthe possibility of confining them without interfering seriously with\r\nthe normal action of their reproductive functions was not yet\r\nestablished. The latter plan was finally adopted, and in 1871 the first\r\nattempt at this method of breeding salmon was instituted by the\r\ncommissioners' of Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. The site fixed\r\nupon for an inclosure was at Craig's Pond Brook in the town of Orland,\r\nand arrangements for a supply of fish were made with two fishermen of\r\nVerona at the very mouth of the river. The salmon first brought were\r\nconfined in a newly constructed artificial pond in the brook, which was\r\nof such remarkable purity that a small coin could be distinctly seen at\r\nthe depth of 7 feet. All of these died except a few which after a short\r\nstay were removed to other quarters. The most prominent symptom was the\r\nappearance of a white fungoid growth in patches upon the exterior of\r\nthe fish. In a lake (locally designated as Craig's Pond) of equal\r\npurity, but greater depth, several of these diseased fish recovered.\r\n\r\nOf the salmon later obtained some were placed in an inclosure of nets\r\nin the edge of a natural pond with but 7 feet of water, of average\r\npurity, some in a shallow inclosure in a brook, and some turned loose\r\nin a natural lake of some 60 acres area, with muddy bottom and\r\npeat-colored water. In each case the salmon passed the summer with few\r\nlosses, arrived at the breeding season in perfect health, and yielded\r\nat the proper time their normal amount of healthy spawn and milt,\r\nthough the great sacrifice of breeding fish by the early experiments of\r\nthe season reduced the crop of eggs to the small number of 72,000.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of success were thus sufficiently indicated, and in 1872\r\nthe same parties, joined with the United States Commission of\r\nFisheries, renewed operations on a larger scale, locating their\r\nheadquarters at the village of Bucksport, confining the breeding salmon\r\nin Spofford's Pond (Salmon Pond on the general map of Penobscot\r\nstation), and establishing their hatchery on the brook formed by its\r\noverflow. This is the lake of 60 acres in which, as mentioned above, a\r\nfew salmon had been successfully confined the year before.\r\n\r\nThough not at all such water as would be chosen by a salmon at large,\r\nit nevertheless proved well adapted to the purpose of an inclosure for\r\nthe breeding fish. It was shallow, its greatest depth, at the season of\r\nhighest water, being but 10 feet; at its upper end it abuts against an\r\nextensive swamp, and almost its entire bottom, except close to the\r\nshore, is composed of a deposit of soft, brown, peaty mud of unknown\r\ndepth. The water is strongly colored with peaty solutions, has a muddy\r\nflavor, and under the rays of a summer sun becomes warmed to 70°\r\n(Fahrenheit) at the very bottom.* Yet in such a forbidding place as\r\nthis, salmon passed the summer in perfect health. There were some\r\nlosses, but every reason to believe them all to have been caused by\r\ninjuries received prior to their inclosure.\r\n\r\n* During the month of August, 1872, the bottom temperature at 1 p.m.\r\nwas never below 70°, and on six days was found to be 71°.\r\n\r\nDuring and after the hottest term of each summer (the month of August)\r\nvery few died.\r\n\r\nThe supply of salmon was obtained mainly, as in 1871, from the weirs in\r\nthe southern part of Verona. They were placed in cars, specially\r\nfitted for the purpose; and towed to Bucksport on the flood tide. From\r\nthe river to the inclosure they were hauled on drays in wooden tanks 3\r\nfeet long, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep, half a dozen at once. From the\r\nweirs to the boats and from the boats to the tanks they were dipped in\r\ngreat canvas bags. From all this handling but few losses ensued.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment at Bucksport village the work was carried on for\r\nfour years, from 1872 to 1876, with a fair degree of success. Then\r\nensued a suspension till 1879, when the reappearance of salmon in the\r\nMerrimack, Connecticut, and some other rivers renewed the hopes of\r\nfinal success, and encouraged the commissioners to reopen the station.\r\nIt had, however, been found that the old location had serious defects.\r\n\r\nThe inclosure was costly to maintain, and the recapture of the fish\r\ninvolved a great deal of labor and trouble. The water supplied to the\r\nhatchery was liable in seasons of little rain to be totally unfit,\r\ncausing a premature weakening of the shell and very serious losses in\r\ntransportation. After a careful search through the neighboring country\r\nit was found that the most promising site for an inclosure was in Dead\r\nBrook, near the village of Orland (though within the limits of the town\r\nof Bucksport), and for a hatchery no location was equal to Craigs Pond\r\nBrook, the spot where the original experiments were tried in 1871. The\r\nonly serious drawback was the separation of the two by a distance of\r\nsome 2 miles, which could not offset the positive advantage of the\r\nhatchery site. Accordingly the necessary leases were negotiated, an\r\ninclosure made in Dead Brook, and a stock of breeding salmon placed\r\ntherein in June, 1879. Since then the work has been continued without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nIt is still found most convenient to obtain the stock of breeding\r\nsalmon, as in the early years of the enterprise, from about a dozen\r\nweirs in the Penobscot River along the shores of the island of Verona.\r\nThe fishermen are provided with dip-nets or bags with which to capture\r\nthe fish in their weirs, with tanks or cars in which to transport them\r\nto the collecting headquarters, whither they are brought immediately\r\nafter capturing, about low water.\r\n\r\nThe collection is in the hands of a fisherman of experience, who\r\nreceives the salmon as they are brought in, counts and examines them,\r\nadjudges their weight, and dispatches them in cars to the inclosure at\r\nDead Brook. The cars are made out of the common fishing boats of the\r\ndistrict, called dories, by providing them with grated openings, to\r\nallow of a free circulation of water in transit, and covering them with\r\nnetting above to prevent the fish from escaping over the sides. The car\r\nis ballasted so that it will be mostly submerged. Ten to fifteen salmon\r\nare placed in a single car, and from one to four cars are taken in tow\r\nby a boat with two to four oarsmen.\r\n\r\nFrom the collecting headquarters to Orland village, a distance of about\r\n5 miles, the route is in brackish water, and the tow is favored by the\r\nflood tide. At Orland is a dam which is surmounted by means of a lock,\r\nand thence, two miles further to Dead Brook, the route is through the\r\ntide less fresh water of Narramissic River. The sudden change from salt\r\nto fresh water does not appear to trouble the fish except when the\r\nweather is very hot and the fresh water is much the warmest. The cars\r\nare towed directly into the inclosure, where the fish are at once\r\nliberated.\r\n\r\nThe inclosure is formed by placing two substantial barriers of woodwork\r\nacross the stream 2,200 feet apart. The lower barrier is provided with\r\ngates which swing open to admit boats. Within the inclosure the water\r\nis from 3 to 8 feet deep, the current very gentle, the bottom partly\r\nmuddy, partly gravelly, supporting a dense growth of aquatic\r\nvegetation. The brook has two clean lakes at its source, and its water\r\nis purer than that of ordinary brooks.\r\n\r\nThe collection of salmon usually continues from the first ten days of\r\nJune until the beginning of July. During the early weeks of their\r\nimprisonment the salmon are extremely active, swimming about and\r\nleaping often into the air. After that they become very quiet, lying in\r\nthe deepest holes and rarely showing themselves. Early in October they\r\nbegin to renew their activity, evidently excited by the reproductive\r\nfunctions. Preparations are now made for catching them by constructing\r\ntraps at the upper barrier. If the brook is in ordinary volume, these\r\nmeans suffice to take nearly all, but a few linger in the deeper pools\r\nand must be swept out with seines. About October 25 the taking of spawn\r\nbegins. After that date the fish are almost always ripe when they first\r\ncome to hand, and in three weeks the work of spawning is substantially\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nAlthough the salmon are taken from the fisherman without any attempt to\r\ndistinguish between males and females, it is always found at the\r\nspawning season that the females are in excess, the average of four\r\nseasons being about 34 males to 66 females. This is a favorable\r\ncircumstance, since the milt of a single male is fully equal to the\r\nimpregnation of the ova of many females.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has several times been tried of marking the salmon after\r\nspawning and watching for their return in after years. After some\r\nexperiments, the mode finally fixed upon as best was to attach a light\r\nplatinum tag to the rear margin of the dorsal fin by means of a fine\r\nplatinum wire. The tags were rolled very thin, cut about half an inch\r\nlong and stamped with a steel die. The fish marked were dis missed in\r\nthe month of November. Every time it was tried a considerable number of\r\nthem was caught the ensuing spring, but with no essential change in\r\ntheir condition, indicating that they had not meanwhile visited their\r\nspawning grounds. In no case was a specimen caught in improved\r\ncondition during the first season succeeding the marking.\r\n\r\nBut the following year, in May and June, a few of them were taken in\r\nprime condition--none otherwise--and it several times occurred that\r\nfemale salmon were a second time committed to the inclosure and yielded\r\na second litter of eggs. The growth of the salmon during their absence\r\nhad been very considerable, there being always an increase in length\r\nand a gain of twenty-five to forty per cent. in weight. The conclusion\r\nseems unavoidable that the adult salmon do not enter the Penobscot for\r\nspawning oftener than once in two years.\r\n\r\nThe method of impregnation employed has always been an imitation of the\r\nRussian method introduced into America in 1871. The eggs are first\r\nexpressed into tin pans, milt is pressed upon them, and after they are\r\nthoroughly mixed together, water is added. The result has been\r\nexcellent, the percentage of impregnated eggs rarely falling so low as\r\n95.\r\n\r\nAfter impregnation the eggs are transferred to the hatchery at Craig's\r\nPond Brook, where they are developed, resting upon wire-cloth trays in\r\nwooden troughs, placed in tiers ten trays deep, to economize space, and\r\nat the same time secure a free horizontal circulation of water.\r\n\r\nThe hatchery is fitted up in the basement of an old mill, of which\r\nentire control has been obtained. The brook is one of exceptional\r\npurity, and a steep descent within a few feet of the hatchery enables\r\nus to secure at pleasure a fall of 50 feet or less. The brook formerly\r\nreceived the overflow of some copious springs within a few hundred feet\r\nof the hatchery, which so affected the temperature of the water that\r\nthe eggs were brought to the shipping point early in December, an\r\ninconvenient date. This has been remedied by building a cement aqueduct\r\n1,600 feet long, to a point on the brook above all the springs, which\r\nbrings in a supply of very cold water.\r\n\r\nThe shipment of eggs is made in January, February, and March, when they\r\nare sent by express, packed in bog-moss, all over the northern States,\r\nwith entire safety, even in the coldest weather.\r\n\r\nIn the following statement is embraced a general summary of the results\r\nof each season's work:\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMAGE orlandeggs.png in html file--table in text file]\r\n\r\n\r\n             Salmon  Females     Eggs          Eggs\r\n    Year     bought  spawned   obtained     distrib'd\r\n    ----     ------  -------   --------     ---------\r\n   1871-72    111       11       72,071        70,500\r\n   1872-73    692      225    1,560,000     1,241,800\r\n   1873-74    650      279    2,452,638     2,291,175\r\n   1874-75    601      343    3,106,479     2,842,977\r\n   1875-76    460      237    2,020,000     1,825,000\r\n   1879-80    264       19      211,692       200,500\r\n   1880-81    522      227    1,930,561     1,841,500\r\n   1881-82    513      232    2,690,500     2,611,500\r\n   1882-83    560      256    2,075,000     2,000,000\r\n            -----    -----   ----------    ----------\r\n   Total    4,373    1,829   16,148,941    14,924,952\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III\r\n\r\nPENNING OF SALMON IN ORDER TO SECURE THEIR EGGS.\r\n\r\nBy C. J. Bottemanne M.D. [From a letter to Prof. S. F. Baird.]\r\n\r\n_Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission_, Vol. 4, Page 169, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Dutch \"Economist\" of 1874 I gave a description of the fish\r\nbreeding establishment of the State of New York, and therein I mentioned\r\nthe United States salmon-breeding establishment on the Penobscot,\r\nprincipally for the penning of the salmon from June till breeding time.\r\nAs you are likely aware, the Dutch Government pays yearly $4,800 to\r\nsalmon breeders for young salmon delivered in spring, at the rate of 10\r\ncents for yearlings, and not quite (4/5) one dollar per hundred for\r\nthose that are about rid of the umbilical sac, and ready to shift for\r\nthemselves. For the latter they receive payment only if there is money\r\nleft after delivering the yearlings.\r\n\r\nThe breeders get their eggs from Germany from Schuster in Freiburg, and\r\nfrom Gloser in Basel; but complain always that the eggs are from too\r\nyoung individuals, that there is always too much loss in transportation,\r\nthat the eggs are so weak that after the fish have come out there is\r\ngreat mortality in the fry, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this month's \"Economist\" I published the results on the Penobscot,\r\nand figured out that if breeders here set to work in the same style they\r\nwould get at least four eggs to one, at the same price, and be\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nWe have an association here for promoting the fresh-water fisheries, of\r\nwhich the principal salmon fishermen are members, and also several\r\ngentlemen not in the business, including myself. In the December meeting\r\nI told them all I knew about the Penobscot; and one breeder got a credit\r\nfor $200 for getting ripe salmon and keeping them in a scow till he had\r\nwhat he wanted, and he has succeeded pretty well. Still this is only on\r\na limited scale. I want to put up larger pens and in the style of the\r\nPenobscot. In order to do this I must know exactly what is done on the\r\nPenobscot, and how.\r\n\r\nWhat is the size of the pen, how large area, how deep? Is it above tidal\r\nwater? (This I take for granted.) What is the situation of the pond\r\ncompared with the river? What kind of failures were there, and the\r\nprobable reasons therefor? In short, I would like a complete description\r\nof the place, with the history of it. I hope you will excuse my drawing\r\non you for such an amount, but as the United States is the authority in\r\npractical fish-breeding, we are obliged to come to you.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that I cannot report the catch of any _S. quinnat_,\r\nyet three fish have been sent in for the premium we held out for the\r\nfirst fifteen caught, but they proved not to be quinnat. Lately I heard\r\nthat there were so many salmon caught in the Ourthe, near Liege, Belgium\r\n(the Ourthe is one of the feeders of the Maas), which was an astonishing\r\nfact, as salmon are seldom taken there.\r\n\r\nBergen op Zoom, Netherlands, January 12, 1884\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA RELATIVE TO INCLOSURES FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF SALMON DRAWN\r\nFROM EXPERIENCE AT BUCKSPORT, PENOBSCOT RIVER, MAINE.\r\n\r\nBy Charles G. Atkins\r\n\r\n[In response to request of Dr. C. J. Bottemanne.]\r\nApril 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n_Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission_, Vol. 4, Pages 170-174,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Penobscot salmon-breeding establishment was founded in 1872, at\r\nBucksport; in the State of Maine, near the mouth of the Penobscot River.\r\nThe location was primarily determined by the necessity of being near a\r\nsupply of living adult salmon, to be used for breeders.\r\n\r\nAfter an exploration of the headwaters of the Penobscot, which lie\r\nmostly in an uninhabited wilderness, the conclusion was reached that the\r\nchances of securing a sufficient stock of breeders were much greater at\r\nthe mouth of the river, where the principal salmon fisheries are\r\nlocated; but to avail ourselves of the supply here afforded we must take\r\nthe salmon at the ordinary fishing season, May, June, and July, and keep\r\nthem in confinement until the spawning season, which is here the last of\r\nOctober and first of November. As the salmon naturally pass this period\r\nof their lives in the upper parts of the rivers, it was thought\r\nessential to confine our captives in fresh water.\r\n\r\nLater experiments in Canada indicate that they will do as well in salt\r\nwater, but the construction and maintenance of inclosures is much easier\r\nwhen they are located above the reach of the tide, to say nothing of the\r\nproximity of suitable fresh water for the treatment of the eggs. In the\r\nprecise location of the inclosures several changes have been made, but\r\nthey have always been in fresh water, and within convenient distance (5\r\nto 10 miles) of the place where the salmon were captured.\r\n\r\nIn our experiments and routine work we have made use of four inclosures,\r\nwhich I will now describe.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. In Craig's Pond Brook, a very pure and transparent stream, an\r\nartificial pond 40 square rods in area and 7 feet in extreme depth, was\r\nformed by the erection of a dam. The bottom of this pond was mainly a\r\ngrassy sod newly flooded. About half the water came from springs in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, and the rest from a very pure lake half a mile\r\ndistant. The water derived from the lake was thoroughly aerated by its\r\npassage over a steep rocky bed. The transparency of the water in the\r\npond was so great that a pin could be seen at the depth of six feet.\r\n\r\nThis inclosure was a complete failure. The salmon placed therein were\r\nafter a day or two attacked by a parasitic fungoid growth on the skin,\r\nand in a few days died. Out of 59 impounded not one escaped the disease\r\nand only those speedily removed to other waters recovered. Several,\r\nremoved in a very sickly condition to the lake supplying the brook,\r\nrecovered completely, from which it is safe to infer that the cause of\r\nthe trouble did not lie in the lake water.\r\n\r\nOf the spring water I have some suspicions, and should not dare to\r\ninclose salmon in it again.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. After the failure of the above experiment an inclosure was made\r\nin the edge of an ordinary lake by stretching a stout net on stakes.\r\nThis water was brown in color, and objects 4 feet beneath the surface\r\nwere invisible. The bottom was gravelly and devoid of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe depth was 7 and one half feet in early summer, and about 4 feet\r\nafter the drought of August and September. The area inclosed was about\r\n25 square rods in June, and perhaps half as much at the end of summer.\r\nThis inclosure was entirely successful, very few salmon dying in it\r\nexcept those that had been attacked by disease before their\r\nintroduction, and all the survivors were found to be in first-rate\r\ncondition in November. This site was not afterwards occupied, because\r\nit was inconveniently located, and was exposed to the full force of\r\nviolent winds sweeping across the lake, and therefore unsafe.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. The inclosure in use for the confinement of the stock of\r\nbreeding fish for the four years from 1872 to 1875, inclusive, was made\r\nby running a barrier across a narrow arm of a small lake (mentioned in\r\nofficial reports as \"Spofford's Pond\") near Bucksport village. This\r\nbody of water, about 60 acres in area in the summer, receives the\r\ndrainage of not more than 5 square miles of territory through several\r\nsmall brooks, that are reduced to dry beds by an ordinary drought.\r\nAbout a quarter of the shores are marshy and the rest stony. The water\r\nis highly colored by peaty matters in solution, and all objects are\r\ninvisible at a depth of 2 feet: The bottom is composed mostly of a fine\r\nbrown peaty mud of unknown depth. Aquatic vegetation of the genera,\r\n_Nuphar_, _Nymphaea_, _Bragenia_, _Potamogeton_, &c., is abundant. The\r\nwater is nowhere more than 16 feet deep in the spring, and 11 feet in\r\nmidsummer. The portion inclosed is 2 feet shoaler.\r\n\r\nThe inclosure occupied sometimes 8 or 10 acres, and sometimes less. The\r\nbarrier was from 400 to 600 feet long, and was formed the first year of\r\nbrush; the second and third years of stake-nets, weighted down at the\r\nbottom with chains; and the fourth year of wooden racks, 4 feet wide\r\nand long enough to reach the bottom, which were pushed down side by\r\nside. The brush was unsatisfactory. There were holes in it by which the\r\nfish escaped. A single net would not retain its strength through a\r\nwhole season, the bottom rotting away and letting the fish out, unless\r\nbefore the autumn was far advanced its position were reversed, the\r\nstronger part that had been above water being placed now at the bottom.\r\nThis method was therefore rather expensive and not perfectly secure.\r\nThe wooden racks were costly and heavy to handle, but quite secure.\r\n\r\nThe salmon placed in this inclosure had to be carted in tanks of water\r\noverland about a mile in addition to transportation in floating cars\r\nfrom 3 to 5 miles; they were transferred suddenly from the salt water\r\nof the river (about two-thirds as salt as common sea-water) into the\r\nentirely fresh water of the lake. To all the supposed unfavorable\r\ncircumstances must be added the high summer temperature of the water.\r\nDuring August the mean was generally above 70 degrees Fahrenheit at the\r\nbottom and several degrees warmer at the surface. Occasionally there\r\nwas observed a midday temperature of 74 degrees F. and once 75 degrees\r\nat the bottom. Yet this proved an excellent place for our purpose, a\r\nsatisfactory percentage of the salmon remaining in perfect health from\r\nJune to November.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. The inclosure in use since 1870 at Dead Brook, Bucksport. It is\r\nlocated in a gently running stream bordered by marshy ground, with a\r\nbottom in part of gravel but mostly of mud, crowded with aquatic\r\nvegetation. The water, supplied by two small lakes among the hills, is\r\ncleaner than the average of Maine rivers, but does not in that respect\r\napproach the water of inclosure No. 1. The greatest depth is about 8\r\nfeet, but in the greater part of the inclosure it is from 3 to 5 feet.\r\nThe width of the stream is from 2 to 4 rods, and the portion inclosed\r\nis 2,200 feet long. The barriers to retain the fish are in the form of\r\nwooden gratings, with facilities for speedily clearing them of debris\r\nbrought down by the stream.\r\n\r\nBetter results were expected from this inclosure than from No. 3, but\r\nhave not been realized. The percentage of salmon dying in confinement\r\nhas been greater, amounting commonly to about 25 percent of those\r\nintroduced, and this notwithstanding the salmon are conveyed to the\r\ninclosure by water carriage the entire distance (7 miles) instead of\r\nbeing carted in tanks.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the trouble has not yet been discovered, but there is good\r\nreason for thinking that it lies in some of the circumstances attending\r\nthe transfer of the fish from the place of capture, and that the\r\ninclosure itself is perfectly suited to its purpose. This view is\r\nsupported by the fact that nearly all the losses occur within a few\r\nweeks after the introduction of the salmon and almost wholly cease by\r\nthe end of July. If the cause of disease was located in the inclosure,\r\nwe should expect it to be more fatal after a long than a short duration\r\nof the exposure of the fish to its action, and that with the smaller\r\nvolume and higher temperature of August it would be more active than in\r\nJune and July.\r\n\r\nThe above description will, I think, give Dr. Bottemanne a sufficiently\r\ncorrect idea of the character of the inclosures we have tried. There\r\nare, however, several other points to be touched upon to put him in\r\npossession of the practical results of our experience.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for the recapture of the salmon when the spawning season\r\napproaches must be considered. In the lake at Bucksport village (No. 3)\r\nwe hoped at first that their desire to reach a suitable spawning ground\r\nwould induce them all to enter the small brook that forms the outlet,\r\nwhich was within the limits of the inclosure. In this matter our\r\nexpectations were but partially realized. Many of the fish refused to\r\nleave the lake through the narrow opening that was afforded them, and\r\nwere only obtained by pound-nets, seines, and gill-nets, all of which\r\ninvolved a considerable expenditure of labor and material.\r\n\r\nThe drawing of a seine in a large body of fresh water is likely to be\r\na serious undertaking unless the bottom has been previously cleared of\r\nsnags. In this respect the long and narrow inclosure at Dead Brook\r\npossesses great advantages, since it can be swept with a comparatively\r\nshort seine. However, the influx and efflux of a considerable volume of\r\nwater is of great advantage in enticing the gravid fish into traps that\r\ncan readily be contrived for them by any ingenious fisherman.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a gravelly bottom in the inclosure must be considered\r\na positive disadvantage, inasmuch as it affords the fish a ground on\r\nwhich they may lay their eggs before they can be caught; but the danger\r\nof such an occurrence is less as the bounds of the inclosure are more\r\ncontracted and the facilities for capturing the fish are better.\r\n\r\nAs to the number of fish to a given area, I think we have never\r\napproached the maximum. I should have no hesitation in putting 1000\r\nsalmon in the inclosure at Dead Brook, which covers an area of less\r\nthan 3 acres. Of course the renewal of the water supply, or its\r\naeration by winds, is of importance here.\r\n\r\nThe capture and transport of the fish in June involves methods\r\nrequiring some explanation. The salmon fisheries about the mouth of the\r\nPenobscot River are pursued by means of a sort of trap termed a \"weir.\"\r\nIt is constructed of fine-meshed nets hung upon stakes, arranged so as\r\nto entrap and detain the fish without insnaring them in the meshes.\r\nThey swim about in the narrow \"pound\" of the weir until the retreating\r\ntide leaves them upon a broad floor.\r\n\r\nJust before the floor is laid bare, the salmon destined for the\r\nbreeding works are dipped out carefully with a cloth bag or a very fine\r\nbag-net and placed in transporting cars or boats, rigged specially for\r\nthe purpose, sunk deep in the water, which fills them, passing in at\r\ntwo grated openings above, and passing out at two others astern, and\r\ncovered with a net to prevent escape. In a boat 13 or 14 feet long (on\r\nthe bottom) we put 10 or 15 salmon, to be towed a distance of 7 miles.\r\nIf the water is cool, twice as many can go safely, but there must be no\r\ndelay. It is very important that this car be smooth inside, with no\r\nprojections for the salmon to chafe on, and the gratings must be so\r\nclose that they cannot get their heads in between the bars.\r\n\r\nIf conveyance overland is necessary, a wooden tank 3 feet long, 2 feet\r\nwide, and 2 feet deep, with a sliding cover, will take six salmon at a\r\ntime for a mile and perhaps farther, and they may be jolted along over\r\na rough road in comparative safety.\r\n\r\nIt has been our uniform experience that all the salmon that survive\r\ntill autumn were in normal condition as to their reproductive function,\r\nand yielded healthy spawn and milt. On two occasions we suffered\r\nserious losses of eggs. In neither instance could the loss be\r\nattributed to any defect in the inclosure, but on one occasion the\r\nconclusion was reached that the water which was well suited to the\r\nmaintenance of the fish was injurious to the eggs, rendering the shell\r\nso soft that they could not be transported safely.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the disasters enumerated above, there has been\r\nbut one that I can recall, and that was caused by the bursting of our\r\nbarriers at Dead Brook under the pressure of a flood.\r\n\r\nBUCKSPORT, ME, April 7, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE SCHOODIC SALMON WORK OF 1884-85\r\n\r\nBy Charles G.

Fish Commission Station at\r\nCraig Brook, Maine.\r\n\r\n_Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission_, Vol. 13,\r\nPages 221-228, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe station of the U. S. Fish Commission at Craig Brook was founded in\r\n1889, on the same site where, in 1871, the first attempt at the\r\nartificial spawning of salmon in the United States was made. This site\r\nhad been selected by the commissioners of fisheries of the States of\r\nMaine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut for that experiment because of\r\nits proximity to the salmon fisheries of the Penobscot River and the\r\nfacilities presented for the maturing of the spawn that might be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe collection of spawn has been carried on in the vicinity annually\r\nfrom 1871 to the present time, with the exception of the three years\r\n1876,1877, and 1878, and since 1879 the development of the spawn has\r\nbeen conducted constantly at Craig Brook. No attempt was, however, made\r\nto rear the fry of any species until 1886. Two years later it was\r\ndefinitely determined to found a permanent station at Craig Brook, and\r\nin 1889 the purchase of the grounds was effected and permanent\r\nimprovements begun.\r\n\r\nThe station is located in the town of Orland, Me., 7 miles east of\r\nBucksport, a seaport on the Penobscot River. Its territory embraces a\r\ntract of land extending between Allamoosook Lake and Craig Pond and\r\nembracing within its limits the entire length of Craig Brook, which\r\nconnects those two bodies of water. Its latitude is about 44 degrees\r\n42' N. The mean annual temperature and precipitation are believed to\r\napproximate those of Orono, 25 miles distant, namely, 42.48° F. [5.8°\r\nC.] and 45.44 inches [116 cm.]. The range of air temperature observed\r\nat the station is from 18° F. below zero to 92.5°F. above [-27.7° C.\r\nto 33.6° C.]. Frosts not infrequently occur as late as the 1st of June\r\nand as early in autumn as the first week in September. The lakes in the\r\nvicinity are commonly covered with ice before the end of November, and\r\nthey are not often released until near the end of April.\r\n\r\nThe water supply is derived from Craig Brook and from three large and\r\nseveral lesser springs. The source of the brook is Craig Pond, which\r\naffords a constant supply of exceedingly transparent water, warm in\r\nsummer and cold in winter, moderated, however; in both extremes by the\r\nwater from the springs, which mingles with the brook in its lower\r\ncourse, forming about a third of its volume. It is this mixed water\r\nwhich is mainly used in the rearing of fish. Its temperature ranges\r\nfrom 34° F. [1.1° C.] to 70°F. [21.1°C.]. The lowest monthly mean in\r\n1893 was 35.8° F. [2.1° C.] in February. The highest was 64.6°F.\r\n[18.1°C.] in August. The total volume is variable, ranging from 875\r\nto 3,000 gallons and averaging about 1,200 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\nThe difference of level between the source and mouth of the brook is\r\nabout 190 feet. The sharpest descent is just above the hatchery and\r\nrearing troughs, which therefore receive well-aerated water. The\r\nconformation of the ground offers good facilities for the distribution\r\nand utilization of the water.\r\n\r\nThe leading motive in the foundation of this station was the desire to\r\napply to the Atlantic salmon the system of rearing fish to the age of\r\nat least several months before liberating them. This motive has\r\ndetermined not only the principal subjects of the work, but also to a\r\nconsiderable extent the fixtures and methods. The scheme of work was\r\ndetermined in outline several years before the acquisition of full\r\ntitle to the premises, and, circumstances rendering it desirable to\r\nenter at once on its development, it became necessary to have recourse\r\nto movable apparatus, pending authority for permanent improvements.\r\n\r\nHence the erection of a series of small troughs in the open air, which\r\ngave such excellent satisfaction that enlargement took the same\r\ndirection; and it has thus come about that the rearing operations of\r\nthe station down to the present time have been almost exclusively\r\nconducted in open-air troughs. A series of ponds has been constructed,\r\nbut with the exception of a few small ones none of them have been as\r\nyet brought into use.\r\n\r\nThe troughs are for the most part such as are used in the hatchery for\r\nthe maturing of spawn, and their form and size have been adapted to the\r\nhatching apparatus which has been in use at the Maine station for many\r\nyears. The eggs are developed on wire-cloth trays measuring 12 and one\r\nhalf inches in width and length, and the troughs are therefore 12 and\r\nthree quarter inches wide. Their depth is 9 inches and their length is\r\n10 feet 6 inches. Such short troughs were adopted for two reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) It was thought that a greater length might involve the exposure of\r\nthe eggs near the lower end to the danger of a partial exhaustion of\r\nthe air from the water by the eggs above them;\r\n\r\n(2) these short troughs are very convenient to cleanse and to move\r\nabout for repairs or other purposes. They are made of pine boards\r\nseven-eighths inch thick. On the inside they are planed and varnished\r\nwith asphaltum. When used for rearing fish each trough is fitted with a\r\npair of thin wooden covers reaching its entire length hinged to the\r\nsides and meeting each other, when closed, at a right angle, forming;\r\nas it were, a roof over the trough. When closed they protect from\r\npredatory birds and other vermin; when open they are fixed in an\r\nupright position, in effect adding to the height of the sides and\r\npreventing the fish jumping out. The time spent in opening and closing\r\nthe troughs is by this arrangement reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nWater is fed through wooden tubes, and the volume admitted is regulated\r\nby slides The exit of the water is through another tube or hollow plug\r\nstanding upright near the lower end of the trough, and by its height\r\ngoverning the depth of the water. The outlet tube is movable and is\r\ntaken out in cleaning. A wire-cloth screen just above the outlet tube\r\nprevents the fish escaping.\r\n\r\nIn a trough of standard size 2,000 fry are generally placed, and to\r\naccommodate the large numbers of fish reared we bring into use\r\nsometimes nearly 200 troughs which are of necessity placed in the open\r\nair. They are arranged in pairs with their heads against the feed\r\ntroughs, supported by wooden horses at a convenient height from the\r\nground. They are given an inclination of about 2 inches to facilitate\r\ncleaning.\r\n\r\nThe volume of water fed to each trough has varied from time to time,\r\nbut is ordinarily about 5 gallons per minute, which renews the water\r\nevery four minutes. The ordinary arrangement is to use the water but\r\nonce in the troughs, letting it waste into some small ponds in which\r\nyearling and older fish are kept; but there is one system of 52 troughs\r\narranged in four series, which use in succession the same water. From\r\nthese we have learned that young salmon thrive quite as well in the\r\nfourth series as in the first. Indeed, by an actual test, with fish of\r\nlike origin and character in each series, the fish reared in the fourth\r\nseries were found to grow faster, to an important degree, than those in\r\nthe first. This phenomenon probably resulted from a somewhat higher\r\ntemperature which the water acquired in passing through the several\r\nseries. A like observation has been made on a few salmon maintained for\r\na few weeks, in the warmer water of a neighboring brook.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the activity of the station has been mainly occupied\r\nwith Atlantic salmon, but there have been reared each year a few\r\nlandlocked salmon and brook trout, and occasional lots of other\r\nsalmonoids, such as Loch Leven, Von Behr, Swiss-lake, rainbow, and\r\nScotch sea trout. All these have received the same treatment. With the\r\nexception of the rainbow trout, they are all autumn-spawning fishes,\r\nand their eggs hatch early in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe embryos of salmon begin to burst the shell in the month of March,\r\nand the 1st of April may be stated as the mean date of hatching. If the\r\nopen-air troughs are in order--and we aim to have them so--the eggs are\r\ncounted out into lots of 2,000 or 4,000 each and placed before hatching\r\nin their summer quarters. The water is at that time very cold, the\r\ndevelopment of the alevins is slow, and it is not until the latter part\r\nof May that the yolk sack is fully absorbed. June 1 is, therefore, the\r\ndate when feeding is ordinarily begun. The growth of the fish is at\r\nfirst slow, the water being still cool, but is accelerated as the\r\nsummer passes away. In October and November, beginning commonly about\r\nthe middle of October, most of the fish are counted out and liberated,\r\nbut a small number, rarely more than 15,000, being carried through the\r\nwinter at the station. The reserved fish are sometimes left until\r\nmidwinter in their summer quarters, and with a careful covering of the\r\nconduits and banking of the troughs themselves each with coarse hay and\r\nevergreen boughs it is possible to keep them there the year round; but\r\nfor ordinary winter storage there is provided a system of sunken tanks\r\ncovered by a rough shed with a constant water supply. These tanks are\r\nmolasses hogsheads, securely hooped with iron, sunk nearly their entire\r\ndepth into the ground, each with an independent water supply and waste,\r\nthe perforation for the latter being near the surface. They have a\r\ncapacity of from 100 gallons of water upward, and will carry safely\r\neach 500 to 700 fish in their first winter, that is, just approaching\r\nthe age of one year.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement has answered its purpose fairly well, and in a very\r\nrigorous climate or where the water is very cold it is to be\r\nrecommended; but since its construction it has been discovered that at\r\nCraig Brook it is not at all difficult to protect the ordinary troughs\r\nin such a way as to insure their safety from freezing, and their\r\nattendance through the winter is less troublesome than that of the\r\nsunken tanks.\r\n\r\nA list of the articles employed for food at the station since its\r\nfoundation, if designed to include those used on an experimental as\r\nwell as a practical scale, would be a long one, and I will content\r\nmyself with naming the following: On a practical scale we have used\r\nbutcher's offal, flesh of horses and other domestic animals by the\r\ncarcass, fresh fish, maggots; and on an experimental scale, pickled\r\nfish, fresh-water mussels, mosquito larvae, miscellaneous aquatic\r\nanimals of minute size.\r\n\r\nIn the production of maggots we have also made use of large quantities\r\nof stale meat from the markets and some barrels of fish pomace, in\r\naddition to the articles mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe butcher's offal comprises the livers, hearts and lights of such\r\nanimals as are slaughtered in Orland and Bucksport--mainly lambs and\r\nveals. These are collected from the slaughter-houses twice or thrice\r\nweekly, and preserved in refrigerators until used. The quantity of such\r\nmaterial to be had in the vicinity has been inadequate to our needs and\r\nwe have been compelled to look in other directions for food.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of horses has been used only during the season of 1893. Old\r\nand worn out horses and those hopelessly crippled or dying suddenly\r\nhave been bought when offered, and used in the same way as the\r\nbutcher's offal; the parts that could be chopped readily have been fed\r\ndirect to the fish so far as needed; and other parts have been used in\r\nthe rearing of maggots. The season's experience has been so\r\nsatisfactory that greater use will be made of horse flesh hereafter.\r\n\r\nNext to the chopped meat, maggots have constituted the most important\r\narticle of food, and their systematic production has received much\r\nattention. A rough wooden building has been erected for the\r\naccommodation of this branch of the work and one man is constantly\r\nemployed about it during the summer and early autumn months. The\r\nmaggots thus far employed are exclusively flesh-eaters, mainly those of\r\ntwo undetermined species of flies--the first and most important being\r\na small smooth, shining green or bluish-green fly occurring at the\r\nbeginning of summer and remaining in somewhat diminished numbers until\r\nOctober, and the other a large rough, steel-blue fly that makes its\r\nappearance later and in autumn becomes the predominating species,\r\nhaving such hardiness as to continue the reproduction of its kind long\r\nafter the occurrence of frosts sufficiently severe to freeze the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn outline the procedure is to expose the flesh of animals in a\r\nsheltered location during the day, and when well stocked with the spawn\r\nof the flies to place it in boxes which are set away in the \"fly house\"\r\nto develop; when fully grown the maggots are taken out and fed at once\r\nto the fish. The materials used for the enticing of the flies and the\r\nnourishment of the maggots have been various. Stale meat from the\r\nmarkets has been perhaps the leading article, but we have also used\r\nsuch parts of the butcher's offal and of the horse carcasses as were\r\nnot well adapted to chopping; fish, fresh dried or pickled; fish pomace\r\nfrom herring-oil works, and any animal refuse that came to hand.\r\n\r\nFresh or slightly tainted meat has been used to greater extent than any\r\nother material, and has proved itself equally good with any. Fresh fish\r\nis very attractive to the flies, and when in just the proper condition\r\nmay be equally good with fresh meat, but some kinds of fish are too\r\noily, for instance, alewives and herring, and all sorts thus far tried\r\nare apt to be too watery.\r\n\r\nA very limited trial of fish dried without salt or smoke indicates that\r\nit is, when free from oil, a very superior article; it has, of course,\r\nto be moistened before using. Its preparation presents some\r\ndifficulties, but in winter it is easily effected by impaling the whole\r\nfish on sticks and hanging them up, (after the manner of alewives or\r\nherring in a smokehouse) under a roof where they will be protected from\r\nrain without hindering the circulation of air; in this way we have\r\ndried many flounders and other refuse fish from the smelt fisheries,\r\nwhich are conducted with bag nets in the vicinity of Bucksport.\r\n\r\nDoubtless a centrifugal drying machine might be successfully used for\r\nthis purpose in summer. Pickled alewives, freshened out in water, have\r\nbeen found to answer fairly well, when other materials are lacking, at\r\nleast to give growth to maggots otherwise started. Fish pomace has not\r\nthus far given satisfaction, but seems worthy of further trial.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly necessary to expose meat but a single day to obtain\r\nsufficient fly spawn; the larvae are hatched and active the next day,\r\nexcept in cool weather, and they attain their full growth in two or\r\nthree days. To separate them from the remnants of food and other debris\r\nwas at first a troublesome task. It is now effected as follows: the\r\nmeat bearing the fly spawn is placed on a layer of loose hay or straw\r\nin a box which has a wire-cloth bottom, and which stands inside a\r\nslightly larger box with a tight wooden bottom. When full grown the\r\nmaggots work their way down through the hay into the lower box, where\r\nthey are found nearly free from dirt.\r\n\r\nWhen young salmon or trout first begin to feed they are quite unable to\r\nswallow full-grown maggots. Small ones are obtained for them by putting\r\na large quantity of fly spawn with a small quantity of meat, the result\r\nbeing that the maggots soon begin to crowd each other and the surplus\r\nis worked off into the lower box before attaining great size. No\r\nattempt is, however, made to induce the young fish to swallow even the\r\nsmallest maggots until they have been fed a while an chopped liver.\r\n\r\nIn the above methods maggots are produced and used in considerable\r\nnumbers, sometimes as many as a bushel in a day. Through September,\r\n1893, although the weather and some other circumstances were not very\r\nfavorable, the average daily production was a little over half a\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nThey are eagerly eaten by the fish, which appear to thrive on them\r\nbetter than on dead meat. Having great tenacity of life, if not snapped\r\nup immediately by the fish they remain alive for a day or two, and, as\r\nthey wriggle about on the bottom, are almost certain to be finally\r\neaten; whereas the particles of dead flesh that fall to the bottom are\r\nlargely neglected by the fish and begin to putrefy in a few hours. In\r\nthe fish troughs there are, therefore, certain gains in both\r\ncleanliness and economy from the use of maggots which may be set down\r\nas compensating the waste and filthiness of the fly-house.\r\n\r\nAs the growth of maggots can be controlled by regulation of the\r\ntemperature, it is possible to keep them all winter in a pit or cellar,\r\nand advantage is taken of this to use them during winter as food for\r\nfish confined in deep tanks not easily cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe offensive odors of decaying flesh may be largely overcome by\r\ncovering it, on putting it away in the boxes, after the visits of the\r\nflies, with pulverized earth, and it is not improbable that by this or\r\nsome other method the business may be made almost wholly inoffensive,\r\nbut in its present stage of development it is too malodorous to admit\r\nof practice in any place where there are human habitations or resorts\r\nwithin half a mile of the spot where the maggots are grown.\r\n\r\nAs remarked above, only flesh-eating maggots have yet been tried. It\r\nwould be well worth while to experiment with the larvae of other\r\nspecies, such as the house fly, the stable fly, etc. There is also a\r\nwhite maggot known to grow in heaps of seaweed. Should the rate of\r\ngrowth of either of these species be found to be satisfactory they\r\nmight be substituted for the flesh maggots with advantage.\r\n\r\nOccasional use has been made of fresh fish for direct feeding. When\r\nthrown into the water after chopping it breaks up into fibers to such\r\nan extent that it is not very satisfactory, and I do not suppose we\r\nshall use it in the future, unless in a coarsely chopped form for the\r\nfood of large fish. A few barrels of salted alewives have been used,\r\nand if well soaked out and chopped they are readily eaten by the larger\r\nfish and can be fed to fry, but are less satisfactory with the latter,\r\nand like fresh fish they break up to such an extent that they are only\r\nto be regarded as one of the last resorts.\r\n\r\nFresh-water mussels have been occasionally gathered in the lake close\r\nto the station when there has been a scarcity of food. Those employed\r\nbelong almost wholly to a species of Unio which abounds over a\r\nconsiderable area of soft bottom, under a depth of 2 to 10 feet of\r\nwater. Many were taken with a boat dredge; more were scooped up with\r\nlong-handled dip nets of special construction. Finally a wide, flat\r\ndredge was made, to be drawn by a windlass on the shore and manipulated\r\nby means of poles from a large boat.\r\n\r\nWhen needed for food the mussels were opened with knives--a great\r\ntask--and chopped. The meat is readily eaten by all fishes, and appears\r\nto form an excellent diet. Being more buoyant than any other article\r\ntried, it sinks slower in the water and gives the fish more time to\r\nseize it before it reaches the bottom, a consideration of considerable\r\npractical importance. The labor involved in dredging and shelling is a\r\nserious drawback, but were the colonies of unios sufficiently extensive\r\nor their reproduction rapid enough to warrant expenditure of time in\r\nexperimentation; improved methods might be devised, which would put\r\nthis food-source on a practicable basis.\r\n\r\nDuring the seasons of 1886 and 1888 some use was made of mosquito\r\nlarvae. Near the station is an extensive swamp where these insects\r\nbreed in great numbers. From the pools of water the larvae were daily\r\ncollected by means of a set of strainers specially devised for this\r\nuse. Barrels filled with water were also disposed in convenient places\r\nnear the rearing troughs, and were soon swarming with larvae from the\r\neggs deposited by the mosquitoes on the surface of the water. When near\r\nthe completion of their growth, which was only some ten days after the\r\ndeposit of the eggs, the larvae (or pupae) were strained out and fed\r\nto the fish. No kind of food has been used this station that has been\r\nmore eagerly devoured, and so far as our observation has gone no other\r\nfood has contributed more to the growth of the fish; indeed, I am\r\ninclined to put them at the head in both respects. It was found,\r\nhowever, that the time expended in collecting them was out of all\r\nproportion to the quantity of food secured, and pending opportunity for\r\nfurther experiment their use was discontinued.\r\n\r\nI think it quite possible that an arrangement might be devised whereby\r\nthe greater part of the labor might be saved. Perhaps a series of\r\nbreeding tanks arranged in proximity to the fish troughs, into which\r\nthe water containing the larvae might be drawn when desirable by the\r\nsimple opening of faucet, would solve the problem.\r\n\r\nVarious methods of serving the food have been tried, but at present\r\neverything is given with a spoon. The attendant carries the food with\r\nthe left hand--in a 2-quart dipper if chopped meat, in a larger vessel\r\nif maggots--and, dipping it out with a large spoon, strews it the whole\r\nlength of the trough, being careful to put the greater portion at the\r\nhead, where the fish nearly always congregate. Finely chopped food, for\r\nvery young fish, is slightly thinned with water before feeding. At one\r\ntime the finest food was fed through perforations in the bottom of a\r\ntin dish; the food was placed in the dish, which was dipped into the\r\nwater a little and shaken till enough of the food had dropped out of\r\nthe perforations; this practice was laid aside because it was thought\r\nthat the food was too much diluted.\r\n\r\nIn feeding maggots it was, at first, the practice to place them on\r\nsmall \"feeding boards\" of special construction suspended over the water\r\nin the troughs and let them crawl off into the water; but whatever\r\nadvantage this method may have had in furnishing the meal to the fish\r\nslowly was more than counterbalanced by the extra labor of caring for\r\nthe boards and by the offensive odor, and it was abandoned. For use in\r\nfeeding fish in a pond a box containing a series of shelves, down which\r\nthe maggots slowly crawl, was found sufficiently useful to be retained.\r\n\r\nIt is the common practice to feed all meat raw except the lights, which\r\nchop better if boiled first, except also occasional lots of meat that\r\nare on the point of becoming tainted and are boiled to save them. All\r\nmeats fed direct to the fish are first passed through a chopping\r\nmachine. The machine known as the \"Enterprise\" is the one now in use.\r\nIt forces the meat through perforated steel plates. The plate used for\r\nthe smaller fish has perforations 2 inch in diameter, and for coarser\r\nwork there are two plates 3/16th inch and 3/8th inch, respectively. It\r\nis operated by a crank turned by hand.\r\n\r\nFood is given to those fish just beginning to eat four times a day (in\r\nsome cases even six times). As the season progresses the number of\r\nrations is gradually reduced to two daily. In winter such fish as are\r\ncarried through are fed but once a day. The cleaning of the troughs has\r\nbeen a troublesome matter, and the subject of much study and\r\nexperiment, but nothing more satisfactory has been found than the\r\nfollowing practice: The troughs are all to be cleaned daily--not all at\r\none time, but as time is found for it in the intervals of other work.\r\nTo facilitate cleaning, the troughs are inclined about 2 inches. The\r\noutlet is commanded, as already explained, by a hollow plug.\r\n\r\nWhen this is drawn the water rushes out rapidly and carries most of the\r\ndebris against the screen. The fishes are excited, and, scurrying\r\nabout, they loosen nearly all dirt from the bottom; what will not\r\notherwise yield must be started with a brush, but after the first few\r\nweeks the brush has rarely to be used except to rub the debris through\r\nthe outlet screen. Owing to the inclination of the trough the water\r\nrecedes from the upper end until the fishes lying there are almost\r\nwholly out of water, but, although they are left in that position\r\nsometimes for 10 or 15 minutes, no harm has ever been known to result.\r\n\r\nIt has been the common rule at the station to count all the embryos\r\ndevoted to the process of rearing, either before or after hatching; to\r\nkeep an accurate record of losses during the season, and to check the\r\nrecord by a recount in the fall. When eggs are counted they are lifted\r\nin a teaspoon.\r\n\r\nThe counting of small fish is effected in this way: The fish are first\r\ngathered in a fine, soft bag-net, commonly one made of cheese-cloth,\r\nand from this, hanging meanwhile in the water, yet so that the fish\r\ncannot escape, they are dipped out a few at a time, in a small dipper\r\nor cup, counted, and placed in a pail of water or some other\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\nThis counting is generally preliminary to weighing, and in this case\r\nthe fish, after counting, are placed in another bag-net, in which they\r\nare lowered, several hundred at a time, into a pail of water which has\r\nbeen previously weighed, and the increase noted. With care to avoid\r\ntransferring to the weighing pail any surplus water, this is a correct\r\nmethod and very easy and safe for the fish.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I submit some estimates of cost. In September, 1893, we\r\nfed fry that were estimated at the close of the month to number\r\n238,300. There were also a few hundred larger fish.\r\n\r\nFrom the known total outlay for food, attendance, and superintendence a\r\nsuitable allowance is made for the maintenance of the older fish, and\r\nthe balance is charged to the fry. By this method we arrive at the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n\r\nCost...................Total........Per fish.\r\nFood                   $155.00      $0.00065\r\nAttendance               99.79        .00042\r\nSuperintendence         205.96        .00086\r\nTotal                   460.75       0.00193\r\n\r\nApplied to the rearing operations of 1891, a similar calculation gives\r\nus this result: The fry that were carried through the season from June\r\nto October, inclusive, cost, for food, attendance, and superintendence,\r\n$0.0081 each; that is, about four-fifths of a cent each for the term of\r\nfive months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE CAPTURE OF ATLANTIC SALMON AT SEA AND IN THE COAST WATERS\r\nOF THE EASTERN STATES\r\n\r\nBy Hugh M. Smith, M. D., Assistant in charge of Division of Statistics\r\nand Methods of the Fisheries.\r\n\r\n_Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission_, Vol. 14, Page 95, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn carrying out its most important function--the maintenance and\r\nincrease of the supply of food fishes--the U.S. Commission of Fish and\r\nFisheries, in addition to direct efforts to increase the abundance of\r\nfishes naturally inhabiting our various rivers, lakes, and coast\r\nwaters, has given considerable attention to the experimental\r\nintroduction of fishes into regions or streams to which they were not\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful success which has followed the planting of shad and\r\nstriped bass fry in the waters of the Pacific coast is well known. The\r\nresults attending the recent attempts of the Commission to establish\r\na run of salmon (_Salmo salar_) in some of the large rivers of the\r\nAtlantic coast have been so noteworthy in the case of the Hudson as\r\nto afford reasonable ground for expecting the early inauguration of a\r\nregular fishery, should the present rate of increase in the abundance of\r\nthe fish be maintained. Similar striking results may also be anticipated\r\nin all the more northern streams of the east coast, including the\r\nHousatonic, Connecticut, and Merrimac, in which salmon were at one time\r\nfound in abundance and are now taken in small numbers, if the ascent\r\nof the adult fish to the headwaters for the purpose of spawning is\r\npermitted and if sufficiently extensive fish-cultural operations are\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to record some of the apparent\r\nresults of salmon propagation in our rivers as shown by the occurrence\r\nof the fish at points on the coast or at sea more or less remote from\r\nthe places where fry have been deposited.\r\n\r\nWhile an interesting and instructive compilation might be made of the\r\ninstances of the capture of salmon in the Hudson, Delaware,\r\nSusquehanna, Potomac, and other rivers in which the fish has been\r\nacclimated, such a work is not necessary in view of the notice which\r\nhas already been accorded the matter in the public press and in the\r\nreports of several of the State fish commissions, notably the New York\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nSo much yet remains to be learned regarding the lines of migration of\r\nthe salmon to and from the rivers, its winter habitat, the existence of\r\nan \"instinct of nativity\" which is supposed to impel the return of the\r\nfish to the place where hatched, the extent of the coastwise\r\ndistribution of salmon originally belonging in a given river, and\r\nnumerous other practical and scientific questions, that the\r\npresentation of any data bearing on the occurrence of the fish outside\r\nof the rivers may be regarded as acceptable and timely.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting article on \"Salmon at Sea,\" communicated to the issue\r\nof _Forest and Stream_ for February 18, 1892, Mr. A. N. Cheney, the\r\nwell-known angling expert and writer on fish-cultural matters, discusses\r\nthe question of the whereabouts of salmon after they leave the rivers,\r\nand quotes the following from a previous contribution by himself on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\"There is a certain mystery about the habits and movements of the sea\r\nsalmon, after it has left the fresh-water rivers in which it spawns and\r\ngone down to the sea, that never has been satisfactorily explained. One\r\ntheory is that all the salmon of the rivers along a coast may journey\r\ndown to the sea, and then move ultimately in one great body southward\r\nalong the coast until they find water of suitable temperature, with an\r\nabundance of food, in which to spend their time in growing fat until\r\nthe spawning instinct warns them to return, when they proceed\r\nnorthward, each river school entering its own particular river as the\r\nmain school arrives opposite the river month.\r\n\r\n\"Another theory is that the salmon of each river, as they arrive at its\r\nmouth after descending from its headwaters, go out to sea sufficiently\r\nfar to find the conditions of temperature and food which suit them, and\r\nthere they remain, separate from the salmon of other rivers, until it\r\nis time for them to return to fresh water. Considering the certainty\r\nwith which the salmon of any particular river return again to the\r\nstream of their birth, the latter theory seems the more tenable of the\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\nAnother object of this paper is to solicit correspondence from\r\nfishermen, especially those engaged in the coast and offshore\r\nfisheries, concerning the circumstances of the capture of salmon in\r\ntheir nets, and to bring to their attention the opportunity they will\r\nthus have of increasing the knowledge of the movements of the salmon,\r\nof aiding in the determination of the results of fishcultural\r\noperations, and of ultimately if not immediately benefiting themselves\r\nby supplying information that will conduce to the most effective\r\napplication of artificial methods.\r\n\r\nTo this end it is the intention to send the paper to fishermen engaged\r\nin the mackerel, menhaden, and other sea fisheries, and to operators of\r\npound nets, traps, and other shore appliances, with the hope that\r\ninstances of the capture of salmon may be communicated to this\r\nCommission and notes on the size, condition, movements, etc., of the\r\nfish be furnished.\r\n\r\nTo aid in the identification of the salmon when caught by fishermen who\r\nhave not previously met with the fish, a figure is presented.\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention may be made of the chinook or quinnat salmon\r\nof the Pacific coast (_Oncorhynchus chouicha_), fry of which have been\r\nextensively planted in eastern waters by the U. S. Commission of Fish\r\nand Fisheries. Up to and including the year 1880, about 12,000,000 fry\r\nwere deposited in rivers and other waters tributary to the Atlantic.\r\nWhile a few relatively large examples have been taken, this office has\r\nno information to show that the attempts to acclimate this species on\r\nthe Atlantic coast have as yet been successful. In 1891 a few thousand\r\nyearling salmon were placed in New York waters tributary to the sea.\r\nThe possibility of the survival and growth of some of these and of the\r\nlarge early colonies prompts this reference to the matter and suggests\r\nthe publication of the accompanying figure of the species, to afford a\r\nbasis for distinguishing the two kinds of salmon, which closely\r\nresemble each other. To further aid in the identification of the two\r\nspecies the following key has been prepared:\r\n\r\nRays in anal fin, 9; scales between gill opening and base of tail, 120;\r\nbranchiostegals (false gill openings), 11 ..........ATLANTIC SALMON.\r\n\r\nRays in anal fin, 16; scales between gill opening and base of tail,\r\n150; branchiostegals, (false gill openings) 15 to 19..........PACIFIC\r\nSALMON.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances might be cited of the taking of salmon in the waters\r\nof the Atlantic coast in recent years. Their occurrence in the traps\r\nand pound nets is in fact so common that it would hardly be entitled to\r\nnotice at this time were it not for the circumstance that in regions in\r\nwhich salmon were already known there has been a decided increase in\r\nthe number observed outside the rivers, and that the fish is now being\r\ntaken in localities in which it was not previously found.\r\n\r\nInstances of the capture of salmon in the coast waters of Maine are\r\nnaturally numerous, and without significance so far as the purposes of\r\nthe present paper are concerned. The existence of two important salmon\r\nrivers, the Kennebec and the Penobscot, affords an easy explanation of\r\nthe presence of salmon on the shores of either side of the mouths of\r\nthose streams. In the report of the U. S. Commission of Fish and\r\nFisheries for 1873-73 Mr. Charles G. Atkins, now superintendent of the\r\nsalmon-rearing establishment at East Orland, Me., and an authoritative\r\nwriter on the Atlantic salmon, contributes some notes on its occurrence\r\nin the sea adjacent to Penobscot Bay and at Richmond Island, near\r\nPortland. These cases, however, have little bearing on the subject in\r\nhand, as Mr. Atkins suggests in a recent letter.\r\n\r\nA special inquiry, personally conducted on Matinicus, Monhegan, and\r\nother islands lying far off the Maine coast, and special researches\r\nthere made with appropriate apparatus, would doubtless disclose many\r\ninteresting facts regarding the salmon of a practical and scientific\r\nnature. A few apparently unrecorded notes concerning the fish among\r\nislands off the island of Mount Desert may be given, which are probably\r\nindicative of what may be expected in other sections.\r\n\r\nMr. W. I. Mayo, who has fished herring brush-weirs at the Cranberry\r\nIsles for many years, and is a life-long fisherman in that section,\r\ncommunicates the intelligence that salmon were first observed about\r\nthose islands in 1888. On June 17 a salmon, weighing 20 pounds, was\r\ntaken in a herring weir, and on June 19 another, weighing 19 pounds,\r\nwas caught. On July 14 of the same year 6 salmon, weighing 4 to 6\r\npounds apiece, were secured, but were liberated on account of their\r\nsize. During the four years intervening between 1888 and 1893 none was\r\ntaken around these islands, but in June of the latter year they\r\nreappeared. On June 11 a salmon weighing 15 pounds was taken in a weir,\r\nand on various occasions during that month a number weighing 12 to 15\r\npounds each were caught by boat fishermen on trawl lines fished for\r\ncod.\r\n\r\nThe trawls were baited with herring and set on the bottom in rather\r\ndeep water. Mr. Mayo states that these were the first salmon ever taken\r\non trawl lines in that region. The Cranberry Isles lie off the\r\nsoutheastern part of Mount Desert Island, and are about 25 miles east\r\nfrom Penobscot Bay and about 35 miles in a straight line from the mouth\r\nof the Penobscot River.\r\n\r\nOn the Massachusetts coast salmon are now regularly taken each year at\r\nmost of the important pound-net and trap fisheries. The largest numbers\r\nare caught in Cape Cod Bay. A State law prohibits the taking of salmon\r\nin nets and requires the return to the water alive of all fish so\r\ncaught. This makes the fishermen diffident about giving information and\r\nrenders difficult the determination of the abundance of the fish. On\r\nJune 6, 1879 the _Cape Ann Advertiser_, of Gloucester, contained the\r\nfollowing note:\r\n\r\n\"A 10-pound salmon was taken from a weir off Magnolia Thursday night.\r\nThis is the first salmon caught off Cape Ann for over thirty years. On\r\nSaturday morning three more large salmon were taken. The fishermen are\r\nhighly elated at the prospect of salmon-catching.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the past five or six years a few salmon have been taken almost\r\nevery season in the vicinity of Gloucester, the average annual catch\r\nbeing 4 to 6 fish. In 1888 the State fish commissioners reported the\r\ncapture of 18 salmon in traps at Manchester and Gloucester. In 1893, 13\r\ntraps in the neighborhood of Gloucester took 5 salmon.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1891, a salmon weighing 28 pounds was caught on a cod\r\ntrawl line set near Halfway Rock, off Salem Harbor, Mass.; Mr. William\r\nDennett, of Gloucester, who secured the fish, reports that he sold it\r\nfor $46. Mr. Samuel Wiley, of Gloucester, in September 1893, caught a\r\nsalmon at sea off Gloucester on a trawl line fished for hake. These are\r\nthe only instances that have been reported of the capture of salmon on\r\na hook in the vicinity of Gloucester. As the trawl lines in question\r\nwere set on the bottom at a depth of 20 or 25 fathoms, the fact that\r\nthese two fish at least were swimming on the bottom may be considered\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nRelatively large numbers of salmon have recently been taken in the\r\npound nets of Cape Cod Bay. Capt. Atkins Hughes, of North Truro, one of\r\nthe best-informed and most reliable fishermen in the region, informs us\r\nthat at North Truro, the principal pound-net center in the bay, about\r\n70 large salmon have been annually caught for two or three years. The\r\nfish are taken throughout the entire pound-net season, but are most\r\ncommon in the early part of the fishing year (May and June). Some fish\r\nweighing 25 to 28 pounds have recently been caught. For two or three\r\nyears he has noticed in the pound nets in October large numbers of\r\nyoung salmon, about 6 inches long; each net probably takes one or two\r\nbarrels of these annually; he had never observed these small fish\r\nbefore in his long fishing career in that region. In 1893, however,\r\nrather less than the usual number of large salmon were observed, and\r\nvery few of the small fish mentioned were taken.\r\n\r\nMr. Vinal N. Edwards, of the Fish Commission station at Woods Holl,\r\nMass., states that in September, 1892, when he visited the Cape Cod\r\nregion, a great many salmon were being taken in the pound nets. They\r\nweighed 4 or 5 pounds apiece. At one pound-net fishery in Provincetown\r\nhe saw enough salmon to fill two sugar barrels.\r\n\r\nConcerning the occurrence of salmon in the Cape Cod region, Mr. Cheney,\r\nin the article previously mentioned, quotes Hon. Eugene G. Blackford,\r\nof New York, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We get every winter a few fish from the Atlantic coast that are\r\nevidently part of the schools of fish that run up into the Kennebec,\r\nPenobscot, and other eastern rivers. During November and December we\r\nhad about 15 to 20 fish, weighing from 12 to 24 pounds each, that were\r\ncaught in the mackerel nets in the vicinity of Provincetown and North\r\nTruro, Mass. These nets are set out from the Cape in very deep water.\r\n\r\n\"During the past two or three weeks we have received several specimens\r\nof very handsome salmon from Maine, where they have been caught by the\r\nsmelt fishermen in their nets when they have been fishing for smelt. I\r\nthink these catches of salmon go very far to prove that the schools of\r\nfish are not very far off from our shores during the time that they are\r\nnot found in the rivers, and that both shad and salmon, when they leave\r\nour rivers, do not go either east or south, but are within 100 miles or\r\nso of the rivers where they were spawned. The fish are remarkable in\r\nbeing in splendid condition and perfect in form and appearance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cheney thinks the salmon taken off Cape Cod belong in either the\r\nMerrimac River or the Penobscot River; and, as in the year in question\r\nfish were being caught at the mouth of the Penobscot at the same time\r\nthey were being taken at Cape Cod, he thinks it probable that the fish\r\nin the latter region were from the Merrimac.\r\n\r\nIn the pound-net fishery of the northern coast of New Jersey the recent\r\ncapture of salmon has been a subject of much interest to the local\r\nfishermen and of considerable importance to fish-culturists and\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years a few salmon have, from time to time, been taken\r\nin Sandy Hook Bay, but within the past two or three years there has\r\nbeen an increase in the number caught. At Belford, the principal\r\nfishing center in the bay, Mr. M. C. Lohsen states that some have been\r\ntaken weighing from 12 to 40 pounds, and that in the spring of 1893\r\nmore than the usual number were caught in the pound nets. Mr. Harry\r\nWhite, of the same place, never took salmon in pound nets prior to\r\n1891; he secured 1 that year and 2 in 1892, but failed to get any in\r\n1893. Other fishermen, however, obtained one or two fish. The average\r\nweight of the salmon taken here is 12 to 15 pounds; the largest caught\r\nby Mr. White weighed 17 and one half pounds. Small ones, weighing half\r\na pound each, are sometimes observed. It is only during the month of\r\nMay that salmon are noticed on this shore. One weighing 16 pounds,\r\ntaken in a pound net at this place in 1891, sold for $11; the following\r\nyear two, with a combined weight of 23 pounds, sold for $15.95.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Long Branch, we are informed of the recent capture\r\nof a number of salmon in the pound nets set directly in the ocean. Mr.\r\nEd. Hennessey, of North Long Branch, reports that in 1892 two salmon\r\nand in 1893 one salmon were taken in his pound; they weighed from 10 to\r\n15 pounds each. In April, 1891, Messrs. Gaskins and Hennessey, of the\r\nsame place, secured a salmon in their pound; this was the only one they\r\never took. Messrs. W. T. Van Dyke & Co., pound-net fishermen of Long\r\nBranch, communicate the following instances of the taking of salmon by\r\nthem in 1893: May 10, 1 salmon weighing 9 1/2 pounds; May 11, 1 salmon\r\nweighing 13 1/2 pounds; May 17, 1 salmon, and May 18, 1 salmon, weight\r\nnot given. Messrs. West and Jeffrey, pound-net fishermen at Long\r\nBranch, report that in 1892 they caught 2 small salmon.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, 3 fish were taken, as follows: May 10, a salmon weighing 19\r\npounds; May 18, 1 weighing 12 pounds; May 20, 1 weighing 10 pounds. Mr.\r\nHenry F. Harvey, who fishes a pound net at Mantoloking, N. J., about 35\r\nmiles south of Sandy Hook, communicates the information that in May,\r\n1893, 2 salmon weighing 10 or 12 pounds each were taken at that place.\r\nNone had ever before been caught there.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts at hand concerning the oceanic\r\noccurrence of the salmon has been noted in a previous paper in this\r\nBulletin, (*) but may be again referred to in order to make the present\r\narticle more complete. Instances of the capture or observation of\r\nsalmon far out at sea or even at relatively short distances from land\r\nare very rare and are entitled to publication whenever noted.\r\n\r\nAbout April 10, 1893 the mackerel schooner _Ethel B. Jacobs_, of\r\nGloucester, Mass., was cruising for mackerel off the coast of Delaware.\r\nWhen in latitude 38 degrees, at a point about 50 miles ESE. of Fenwick\r\nIsland light-ship, the vessel fell in at night with a large body of\r\nmackerel, and the seine was thrown round a part of the school. Among\r\nthe mackerel taken was an Atlantic salmon weighing 16 pounds, which\r\nCapt. Solomon Jacobs, who was in command of the schooner, sent home to\r\nGloucester. Capt. Jacobs informs us that the fish was fat and in fine\r\ncondition. Some of the crew told the captain that there was another\r\nsalmon in the seine, but it escaped over the cork line as the seine was\r\nbeing \"dried in.\" The light-ship mentioned is about 10 miles off the\r\ncoast, so the place where these salmon were taken was about 60 miles\r\nfrom the nearest land.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is the only instance known to this Commission of the\r\ncapture of salmon so far at sea on the coast of the United States or of\r\nthe taking of salmon in a purse seine with mackerel under any\r\ncircumstances. Capt. S. J. Martin, the veteran fisherman of Gloucester,\r\nMass., has never known of another such occurrence, and a special\r\ninquiry conducted by him among the mackerel fishermen of that port\r\nfailed to disclose the knowledge among them of a similar case.\r\n\r\nFootnote: * Extension of the Recorded Range of Certain Marine and\r\nFreshwater Fishes of the Atlantic Coast of the United States.",
