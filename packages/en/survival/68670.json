It is shown\r\nthat there is a close relationship with vegetation, the soil population\r\nbeing dependent almost entirely on the growing plant for energy\r\nmaterial, while the plant is equally dependent on the activities of\r\nthe soil population for removing the residues of previous generations\r\nof plants and for the continued production in the soil of simple\r\nmaterials, such as nitrates, which are necessary to its growth. It is\r\nalso shown, however, that the soil population takes toll of the plant\r\nnutrients and that some of its members may directly injure the growing\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe soil population is so complex that it manifestly cannot be dealt\r\nwith as a whole in any detail by any one person, and at the same\r\ntime it plays so important a part in the soil economy that it must\r\nbe seriously studied. Team work therefore becomes indispensable, and\r\nfortunately this has been rendered possible at Rothamsted.\r\n\r\nEach group of organisms is here dealt with by the person primarily\r\nresponsible for that particular section of the work. The plan of the\r\nbook has been carefully discussed by all the authors, and the subject\r\nmatter has already been presented in a course of lectures given at\r\nUniversity College, London, under the auspices of the Botanical\r\nBoard of Studies of the London University. The interest shown in\r\nthese lectures leads us to hope that the subject may appeal to a\r\nwider public, and above all to some of the younger investigators in\r\nbiological science. They will find it bristling with big scientific\r\nproblems, and those who pursue it have the satisfaction, which\r\nincreases as the years pass by, of knowing that their work is not only\r\nof interest to themselves, but of great importance in ministering to\r\nthe intellectual and material needs of the whole community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

One had been since early times\r\nspecially associated with soil fertility, in that it gave rise to\r\nhumus, the black sticky substance in farmyard manure or in soil--which\r\nwas supposed up to 1840 to be the special food of plants. No good\r\naccount of the process or of the conditions in which it occurred is,\r\nhowever, given by the older writers.\r\n\r\nA second resulted in the formation of nitrates. This process became\r\nknown as nitrification: it was described by Georgius Agricola\r\n(1494-1555) in his book “De Re Metallica,” and it was of great\r\nimportance in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, because it\r\nwas used for the manufacture of gunpowder in the great wars of that\r\nperiod. The conditions for the making of successful nitre beds were so\r\nthoroughly investigated that little fresh knowledge was added to that\r\nof 1770[A] until quite recently. This process, however, was not usually\r\nassociated with soil fertility, although both Glauber (1656) and Mayow\r\n(1674) had insisted on the connection.\r\n\r\n  [A] See the remarkable collection of papers entitled\r\n  “Instructions sur l’établissement des nitrières,” publié par les\r\n  Régisseurs-généraux des Poudres et Salpêtre. Paris, 1777.\r\n\r\nA third type of decomposition was brought into prominence by Liebig\r\nin 1840.[7][B] Reviewing the decomposition of organic matter in the\r\nlight of the newer chemistry, he concluded that the process was a\r\nslow chemical oxidation, to which he gave the name “Eremacausis.”\r\nHe recognised that humus was formed, but he regarded it only as an\r\nintermediate product, and emphatically denied its importance in\r\nsoil fertility. The true fertility agents, in his view, were the\r\nfinal products--CO₂, potassium and other alkaline salts, phosphates,\r\nsilicates, etc. He went on to argue brilliantly that instead of\r\napplying farmyard or similar manures to the soil it was altogether\r\nquicker and better to apply these mineral compounds obtained from\r\nother sources than to wait for the slow process of liberation as the\r\nresult of decomposition. For some reason, difficult to understand, he\r\noverlooked nitrification and the part that nitrates might play in soil\r\nfertility. Lawes and Gilbert[6] were much attracted by this new idea;\r\nthey showed that it was incomplete because it took no account of the\r\nnecessity for supplying nitrogen compounds to the crop. When ammonium\r\nsalts were added to Liebig’s ash constituents the resulting mixture had\r\nalmost as good a fertilising effect as farmyard manure. Lawes at once\r\nsaw the enormous practical importance of this discovery, and set up\r\na factory for the manufacture of artificial fertilisers. He did not,\r\nhowever, follow it up more closely on the scientific side.\r\n\r\n  [B] The numbers refer to the short bibliography on p. 18.\r\n\r\nBoth Lawes and Gilbert were in constant touch with the idea of\r\ndecomposition in the soil, and they attached so much importance to\r\nnitrogen compounds in plant nutrition that it is not easy to understand\r\nhow they missed the connection with nitrification. But they did so, and\r\nlike other English and German workers of the day, considered that plant\r\nroots assimilated their nitrogen as ammonia. For the first ten years of\r\nthe history of Rothamsted only few experiments with nitrates were made,\r\nand not till thirty-five years had elapsed were they systematically\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nIt was by Boussingault[2] and in France that the connection between\r\nnitrification and soil fertility was first recognised. The news came\r\nto England, but it was not accepted, although Way, one of the most\r\nbrilliant agricultural chemists of his time, showed that nitrates\r\nwere formed in soils to which nitrogenous fertilisers were added, and\r\nthat they were comparable in their fertiliser effects with ammonium\r\nsalts.[12] “The French chemists,” he wrote in 1856, “are going further,\r\nseveral of them now advocating the view that it is in the form of\r\nnitric acid that plants make use of compounds of nitrogen. With this\r\nview I do not at present coincide, and it is sufficient here to admit\r\nthat nitric acid in the form of nitrates has at least a very high value\r\nas manure.” Indeed, Kuhlmann went so far as to argue that the nitrates\r\nfound in the soil were there reduced to ammonia before assimilation\r\nby plants could take place. The water-culture work of the plant\r\nphysiologists of the ’sixties finally showed the correctness of the\r\nFrench view.\r\n\r\nEven when the importance of nitrification was realised its mechanism\r\nwas not understood: some thought it was chemical, some physical.\r\nAgain the explanation came from France. Pasteur in 1862 had expressed\r\nthe view that nitrification would probably be a biological action,\r\nsince purely chemical oxidation of organic matter was of very limited\r\noccurrence. “Pénétrés de ces idées,” as Schloesing tells us, he and\r\nMüntz in a memorable investigation cleared up the whole problem, and\r\nin 1877 opened the way to a most fruitful field of research.[10] The\r\nformal description is given in his papers in the “Comptes Rendus,”\r\nbut a more lively account is given in his lectures before the _École\r\nd’application des Manufacteurs de l’état_, which, though not printed,\r\nwere collected and issued in script by his distinguished son, and a\r\ncopy of this work is among the treasures of the Rothamsted Library.\r\n\r\nHe had been asked to study the purification of sewage, and he and Müntz\r\nshowed that it was bound up with nitrification. The process was slow in\r\nstarting, then it proceeded rapidly. Why, they asked, was the delay?\r\nThere should be none if the process were physical or chemical, and the\r\nfact that it occurred strongly suggested biological action. The process\r\nwas stopped by chloroform vapour, but could be restarted after the\r\nremoval of the vapour by the addition of a little fresh soil.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this work in connection with soil fertility\r\nwas immediately realised by Warington, who had recently come to\r\nRothamsted.[11] He quickly confirmed the result, and made the valuable\r\ndiscovery that two stages were involved--the conversion of ammonia to\r\na nitrite by one organism, and of the nitrite to nitrate by another.\r\nHe made long and persistent attempts to isolate the organisms from the\r\nsoil, using the best technique of his time, but though he found many\r\nbacteria none of them could nitrify ammonium salts; yet the soil did\r\nit easily. For years he continued his efforts to find the nitrifying\r\norganism, but always failed. His health was not good, his life at\r\nRothamsted was not happy owing to disagreements with Gilbert, and\r\nalthough his other research work was succeeding, this investigation\r\non which he had set his heart was not coming out; bacterial technique\r\nwas not yet sufficiently far advanced. Ten bitter, disappointing years\r\npassed, and the crown of disappointment came when Winogradsky, a young\r\nbacteriologist in Paris, changed the technique and succeeded at once in\r\nisolating both the nitrite and the nitrate-forming organisms.[13]\r\n\r\nThe numerous bacteria found by Warington in the soil suggested the\r\npresence of a soil population, and this idea was greatly strengthened\r\nby another line of investigation which was being followed up in France.\r\nBoussingault had shown that soils absorb oxygen and give out carbon\r\ndioxide; Schloesing extended this discovery, as also did Wollny. It\r\nwas concluded that oxidation was the result of the activities of the\r\nsoil organisms in decomposing the organic matter of the soil, and thus\r\npreparing the way for the nitrifying organisms.\r\n\r\nA third important function of soil bacteria was revealed by\r\nBerthelot.[1] It was known that considerable loss of nitrogen from the\r\nsoil took place as the result of the conversion of nitrogen compounds\r\ninto nitrates, which were subsequently washed out in the drainage\r\nwater. It followed inevitably that the stock of nitrogen compounds in\r\nthe soil must long ago have become exhausted had there been no addition\r\nof nitrogen compounds to the soil. Berthelot argued that there must be\r\nfixation of atmospheric nitrogen, and, following the prevailing trend\r\nof thought in France, he attributed it to bacteria. He confirmed the\r\nanticipation by exposing soil to air in such conditions that dust,\r\nrain, etc., were excluded, and he found an increase in the percentage\r\nof nitrogen.\r\n\r\nLooking back over the work, it is difficult to understand the result.\r\nThe fixation of nitrogen is a process that absorbs energy, and\r\nshould have necessitated some source of energy, which apparently was\r\nnot supplied. But in spite of this drawback the investigation was\r\nimmediately fruitful in that it gave the key to another problem which\r\nhad long puzzled agriculturists.\r\n\r\nIt had long been known that the growth of leguminous crops, unlike that\r\nof others, enriched the ground,[C] and Lawes and Gilbert had shown\r\nthat this was due to an increase of soil nitrogen. But no explanation\r\ncould be found till Hellriegel and Wilfarth solved the problem.[4] In\r\nstudying the nitrogen nutrition of gramineous and leguminous crops,\r\nthey discovered that the gramineous plants died in absence of nitrate,\r\nand in its presence made growth which increased regularly with nitrate\r\nsupply; while leguminous plants sometimes died and sometimes flourished\r\nin absence of nitrate, and behaved equally erratically with increasing\r\nnitrate supply. When the plants flourished nodules were invariably\r\npresent on the roots, but not otherwise. They concluded, therefore,\r\nthat the nitrogen nutrition of leguminous plants differed from that\r\nof the gramineæ, and depended on some factor which sometimes came\r\ninto their experiments and sometimes did not, and, in any case, was\r\nassociated with the nodule. Knowing that the nodules on the roots of\r\nleguminous plants contained bacteria-like bodies, and remembering\r\nBerthelot’s results, they explored the possibility of bacterial\r\nfixation. They sterilised the sand and found that peas invariably\r\nfailed to develop nodules and died, but after adding a little garden\r\nsoil nodules were found and vigorous growth was obtained.\r\n\r\n  [C] “Of the leguminous plants the bean best reinvigorates the ground\r\n  ... because the plant is of loose growth and rots easily, wherefore\r\n  the people of Macedonia and Thessaly turn over the ground when it\r\n  is in flower” (i.e. dig it into the ground if the soil is poor).\r\n  Theophrastus, “Enquiry into Plants,” bk. viii. 2, and bk. ix. I. This\r\n  book is of profound interest to agriculturists and botanists. An\r\n  excellent translation by Sir Arthur Hort is now available. (Loeb’s\r\n  Classical Library.)\r\n\r\nChemical analysis showed considerable fixation of gaseous nitrogen,\r\nwhich Hellriegel associated with the nodule organism. This has proved\r\nto be correct, and the fixation of nitrogen by bacteria is now a\r\nwell-recognised process, the conditions of which are being thoroughly\r\nworked out. Two types of organisms are known--those associated with\r\nleguminous plants, and those living in a free and independent state in\r\nthe soil. Of the latter the Clostridium, isolated by Winogradsky, is\r\nanaerobic, and the Azotobacter of Beijerinck is aerobic. The essential\r\nconditions are that a source of energy must be supplied--usually\r\ngiven as sugar--that the medium must not be acid, and that sufficient\r\nphosphate must be present.\r\n\r\nAll this brilliant work had been accomplished in the short space of the\r\nten years 1880 to 1890. The inspiration had in each instance come from\r\nFrance, and is traceable direct to Pasteur, although coming long after\r\nhis own work on bacteriology. It is impossible for us now to realise\r\nthe thrill of wonder and astonishment with which students, teachers,\r\nand writers of those days learned that the nutrition of plants, and\r\ntherefore the growth of crops and the feeding of themselves, was\r\nlargely the result of the activity of bacteria in the dark recesses of\r\nthe soil. It is not surprising that the ideas were pushed somewhat too\r\nfar, that the soil population was regarded as solely bacterial, and\r\nthat important chemical and physical changes were sometimes overlooked.\r\n\r\nGradually there came the inevitable reaction and a somewhat changed\r\noutlook. Continued examination showed the presence in soil of almost\r\nevery kind of bacteria for which search was made. Some of them were\r\nalmost certainly in the resting condition as spores, and the new\r\ngeneration of workers had an uneasy feeling that the case for the\r\noverwhelming importance of bacteria in the economy of the soil was\r\nnot too well founded. It was shown that the decomposition of nitrogen\r\ncompounds to form ammonia would take place without micro-organisms if,\r\nas presumably would happen, the plant enzymes continued to act after\r\nthey got into the soil. Even the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate--the\r\ngreat stronghold of the biological school--was accomplished by chemical\r\nagents. The fixation of nitrogen in soil conditions was beyond the\r\npower of chemists to achieve, and here it was universally agreed that\r\nbacteria were the active agents. And finally, chemists were themselves\r\nbringing into prominence a set of bodies--the colloids--whose\r\nremarkable properties seemed indefinitely expansible, and were in\r\naddition sufficiently incomprehensible to the ordinary student to\r\nattain much of the magnificence of the unknown.\r\n\r\nAll the time, however, a faithful body of workers was busy exploring\r\nthe ground already won, improving the technique, making counts of the\r\nnumbers of bacteria in the soil, and trying to measure the amount of\r\nbacterial activity. Much of the value of this work was limited by the\r\ncircumstance that the bacteria were regarded as more or less constant\r\nin numbers and activities, so that a single determination was supposed\r\nto characterise the position in a given soil.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of the subject when it was seriously taken up at\r\nRothamsted. Before turning to agriculture, the writer had been studying\r\nthe mechanism of certain slow chemical oxidations, and one of his first\r\nexperiments in agriculture was to examine the phenomena of oxidation\r\nin soil. The results accorded with the biological explanation of\r\nSchloesing: when the soil was completely sterilised oxidation almost\r\nceased. But the striking discovery was made, as the result of an\r\naccident to an autoclave, that partial sterilisation increased the\r\nrate of oxidation, and therefore presumably the bacterial activity.\r\nThis remarkable phenomenon had, however, already been observed, and\r\nit had been shown that both bacterial numbers and soil fertility\r\nwere increased thereby. A full investigation was started in 1907 by\r\nDr. Hutchinson and the writer.[9] From the outset the phenomena were\r\nrecognised as dynamic and not static, and the rates of change were\r\nalways determined: thus the bacterial numbers, the nitrate and ammonia\r\npresent were estimated after the several periods. Close study of the\r\ncurves showed that the chemical and bacterial changes were sufficiently\r\nalike to justify the view that bacteria were in the main the causes\r\nof the production of ammonia and of nitrate; although non-biological\r\nchemical action was not excluded, there was no evidence that it played\r\nany great part. Thus the importance of micro-organisms in the soil was\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe factor causing the increased bacterial numbers after partial\r\nsterilisation was studied by finding out what agents would, and what\r\nwould not, allow the numbers to increase, e.g. it was found that the\r\nbacterial increases became possible when soil had been heated at 56°\r\nC., but not at 40° C. Again, it was shown that the high numbers in\r\npartially sterilised soils rose for a time even higher if a little\r\nfresh untreated soil were incorporated into the partially sterilised\r\nsoil, but afterwards they fell considerably. Putting all the results\r\ntogether, it appeared that some biological cause was at work depressing\r\nthe numbers of bacteria in normal soils, but not--or not so much--in\r\nthe partially sterilised soils. Studied in detail, the data suggested\r\nprotozoa as the agent keeping down bacterial numbers, and they were\r\nfound in the untreated, but not in the treated, soils. The hypothesis\r\nwas therefore put forward that bacteria are not the only members of the\r\nsoil population, but that protozoa are also present keeping them in\r\ncheck, and therefore adversely affecting the production of plant food.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion aroused considerable controversy. It was maintained\r\nthat protozoa were not normal inhabitants of the soil, but only\r\noccasional visitants, and, in any case, they were only there as cysts;\r\nthe soil conditions, it was urged, were not suitable to large organisms\r\nlike protozoa. The objection was not to be treated lightly, but, on\r\nthe other hand, the experiments seemed quite sound. As neither Dr.\r\nHutchinson nor the writer were protozoologists, Dr. T. Goodey and\r\n(after he left) Mr. Kenneth R. Lewin were invited to try and find\r\nout, quite independently of the partial sterilisation investigation,\r\nwhether protozoa are normal inhabitants of the soil, and if so, whether\r\nthey are in a trophic condition, and what is their mode of life and\r\ntheir relation to soil bacteria. Had it turned out that protozoa had\r\nnothing to do with the matter, search would have been made for some\r\nother organism. Goodey showed that the ciliates were not particularly\r\nimportant; Lewin soon demonstrated the existence of trophic amœbæ and\r\nflagellates. Unfortunately he was killed in the war before he had got\r\nfar with the work. After the Armistice, Mr. Cutler accepted charge of\r\nthe work: he will himself relate in Chapters IV. and V. what he has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it might be thought comparatively easy to settle a\r\nquestion of this kind by examining soil under a microscope or by\r\nsterilising it and introducing successively bacteria and known types\r\nof protozoa. Unfortunately neither method is simple in practice. It\r\nis impossible to look into the soil with a microscope, and methods of\r\nteasing-out small pieces of soil on a slide under the high, or even the\r\nlow power, give no information, because the particles of soil have the\r\nremarkable power of attracting and firmly retaining protozoa, and no\r\ndoubt bacteria as well; indeed, for protozoa (which have been the more\r\nfully investigated) there seems to be something not unlike a saturation\r\ncapacity (see Fig. 9, p. 78). Further, complete sterilisation of soil\r\ncannot be effected without at the same time altering its chemical and\r\nphysical properties, and changing it as a habitat for micro-organisms.\r\nCutler has, however, overcome the difficulties and shown that the\r\nintroduction of protozoa into soils sterilised and then reinfected with\r\nbacteria considerably reduces the numbers of these organisms.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted, therefore, is to take a census of population and\r\nof production. Counting methods are elaborated, and estimates as\r\naccurate as possible are made of the numbers of the various organisms\r\nin a natural field soil at stated intervals. Simultaneously, wherever\r\npossible some measure is taken of the work done. The details of the\r\ncensus are finally arranged in consultation with the Statistical\r\nDepartment, to ensure that the data shall possess adequate statistical\r\nvalue. From the results it is possible to adduce information of great\r\nvalue as to the life of the population, the influence of external\r\nconditions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most important investigation of this kind carried out at Rothamsted\r\nwas organised by Mr. Cutler.[3] A team of six workers was assembled,\r\nand for 365 days without a break they counted every day the ciliates,\r\nthe amœbæ, the flagellates, and the bacteria in a plot of arable\r\nground, distinguishing no less than seventeen different kinds of\r\nprotozoa. The conclusions arrived at were carefully tested by the\r\nStatistical Department.\r\n\r\nOf the protozoa the flagellates were found to be the most numerous,\r\nthe amœbæ came next, and the ciliates were by far the fewest. The\r\nnumbers of each organism varied from day to day in a way that\r\nshowed conclusively the essentially trophic nature of the protozoan\r\npopulation. The numbers of amœbæ--especially _Dimastigamœba_ and of\r\na species called α--were sharply related to the numbers of bacteria:\r\nwhen the amœbae were numerous the bacteria were few, and vice versa.\r\nDetailed examination showed that the amœbæ were probably the cause\r\nof the fluctuations in the bacterial numbers, but Mr. Cutler has not\r\nyet been able to find why the amœbæ fluctuated; it does not appear\r\nthat temperature, moisture content, air supply or food supply were\r\ndetermining causes. The flagellates and ciliates also showed large\r\nfluctuations, amounting in one case--_Oicomonas_--to a definite\r\nperiodicity, apparently, however, not related to bacterial numbers, or,\r\nso far as can be seen, to external conditions of moisture, temperature\r\nand food supply, and showing no agreement with the fluctuations of the\r\namœbæ. However, one cannot be certain that lack of agreement between\r\ncurves expressing protozoan numbers and physical factors implies\r\nabsence of causal relationships: the observations (though the best that\r\ncan yet be made) are admittedly not complete. If we saw only the end of\r\nthe bough of a tree, and could see no connection with a trunk, we might\r\nhave much difficulty in finding relationships between its motion and\r\nthe wind; whatever the direction of the wind it would move backwards\r\nand forwards in much the same way, and even when the wind was blowing\r\nalong the plane of its motion it would just as often move against the\r\nwind as with it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile evidence was obtained that the twenty-four hour interval\r\nadopted by the protozoological staff was too long for bacteria, and\r\naccordingly the Bacteriological Department, under Mr. Thornton, refined\r\nthe method still further. Bacterial counts were made every two hours,\r\nday and night, for several periods of sixty or eighty hours without\r\na break. The shape of the curve suggests that two hours is probably\r\nclose enough, and for the present counts at shorter intervals are not\r\ncontemplated. But there is at least one maximum and one minimum in the\r\nday, although the bacterial day does not apparently correspond with\r\nours, nor can any relationship be traced with the diurnal temperature\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate content of the soil was simultaneously determined by Mr.\r\nPage and found to vary from hour to hour, but the variations did not\r\nsharply correspond with the bacterial numbers; this, however, would not\r\nnecessarily be expected. The production of nitrate involves various\r\nstages, and any lag would throw the nitrate and bacterial curves out\r\nof agreement. There is a suggestion of a lag, but more counts are\r\nnecessary before it can be regarded as established.\r\n\r\nExamination of these and other nitrate curves obtained at Rothamsted\r\nhas brought out another remarkable phenomenon. No crop is growing on\r\nthese plots, and no rain fell during the eighty hours, yet nitrate\r\nis disappearing for a considerable part of the time. Where is it\r\ngoing to? At present the simplest explanation seems to be that it is\r\ntaken up by micro-organisms. A similar conclusion had to be drawn\r\nfrom a study of the nitrogen exhaustion of the soil. The whole of the\r\nnitrate theoretically obtainable from the organic matter of the soil\r\nis not obtained in the course of hours or even days; in one of our\r\nexperiments at Rothamsted nitrification is still going on, and is far\r\nfrom complete, even after a lapse of fifty-three years. The explanation\r\nat present offered is that part of the nitrate is constantly being\r\nabsorbed by micro-organisms and regenerated later on.\r\n\r\nNow what organisms could be supposed to absorb nitrates from the soil?\r\nCertain bacteria and fungi are known to utilise nitrates, and one\r\nnaturally thinks of algæ as possible agents also. Dr. Muriel Bristol\r\nwas therefore invited to study the algæ of the soil. Her account is\r\ngiven in Chapter VI. She has found them not only on the surface, but\r\nscattered throughout the body of the soil, even in the darkness of 4\r\ninches, 5 inches, or 6 inches depth, where no light can ever penetrate,\r\nand where photosynthesis as we understand it could not possibly take\r\nplace. Some modification in their mode of life is clearly necessary,\r\nand it may well happen that they are living saprophytically. Dr.\r\nBristol has not yet, however, been able to count the algæ in the soil\r\nwith any certainty, although she has made some estimates of the numbers.\r\n\r\nThe quantitative work on the soil population indicates other\r\npossibilities which are being investigated. There is not only a daily\r\nfluctuation in the numbers, but so far as measurements have gone,\r\na seasonal one also. There seems to be some considerable uplift in\r\nnumbers of bacteria, protozoa, and possibly algæ and fungi in the\r\nspring-time, followed by a fall in summer, a rise in autumn, and a\r\nfall again in winter. At present we are unable to account for the\r\nphenomenon, nor can we be sure that it is general until many more data\r\nare accumulated.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of the protozoa and the algæ, there was a definite reason\r\nfor seeking them in the soil.\r\n\r\nAnother section of the population, the fungi, was simply found, and\r\nat present we have only limited views as to their function. The older\r\nworkers considered that they predominated in acid soils, while bacteria\r\npredominated in neutral soils. Present-day workers have shown that\r\nfungi, including actinomycetes, are normal inhabitants of all soils.\r\nThe attempts at quantitative estimations are seriously complicated\r\nby the fact that during the manipulations a single piece of mycelium\r\nmay break into fragments, each of which would count as one, while a\r\nsingle cluster of spores might be counted as thousands. Little progress\r\nhas therefore been made on the quantitative lines which have been so\r\nfruitful with protozoa. Dr. Brierley gives, in Chapters VII. and VIII.,\r\na critical account of the work done on fungi.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the organisms already considered there are others of\r\nlarger size. The nematodes are almost visible to the unaided eye,\r\nmost of them are free living and probably help in the disintegration\r\nof plant residues, though a few are parasitic on living plants and do\r\nmuch injury to clover, oats, and less frequently to onions, bulbs, and\r\npotatoes. Further, there are insects, myriapods and others, the effects\r\nof which in the soil are not fully known. Special importance attaches\r\nto the earthworms, not only because they are the largest in size and\r\nin aggregate weight of the soil population, but because of the great\r\npart they play in aerating the soil, gradually turning it over and\r\nbringing about an intimate admixture with dead plant residues, as first\r\ndemonstrated by Darwin. Earthworms are the great distributors of energy\r\nmaterial to the microscopic population. Systematic quantitative work\r\non these larger forms is only of recent date, and Dr. Imms, in Chapter\r\nIX., discusses our present knowledge.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\nSOIL POPULATION, ROTHAMSTED, 1922.\r\n\r\n(The figures for algæ and fungi are first approximations only, and have\r\nconsiderably less value than those for bacteria and protozoa.)\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+--------------------------------+\r\n  |                      |           |Approximate Weight per Acre of--|\r\n  |                      |           +---------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |                      |  Numbers  | Living  |Dry Matter|  Nitrogen |\r\n  |                      |  per Gram | Organ-  |in Organ- | in Organ- |\r\n  |                      |  of Soil. |  isms.  |   isms.  |   isms.   |\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+---------+----------+-----------+\r\n  |_Bacteria_--          |           |   lb.   |   lb.    |    lb.    |\r\n  |   High level         |45,000,000 |    50}  |    2     |    0·2    |\r\n  |   Low level          |22,500,000 |    25}  |          |           |\r\n  |_Protozoa_--          |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |   _Ciliates_--       |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |      High level      |     1,000 |    --   |   --     |    --     |\r\n  |      Low level       |       100 |    --   |   --     |    --     |\r\n  |   _Amœbæ_--          |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |      High level      |   280,000 |   320}  |   12     |    1·2    |\r\n  |      Low level       |   150,000 |   170}  |          |           |\r\n  |   _Flagellates_--    |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |      High level      |   770,000 |   190}  |    7     |    0·7    |\r\n  |      Low level       |   350,000 |    85}  |          |           |\r\n  |   _Algæ_             |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |      (not blue-green)|  [100,000]|   125   |    6     |    0·6    |\r\n  |      Blue-green      | Not known.|         |  Say 6   |  Say 0·6  |\r\n  |   _Fungi_--          |           |         |          |           |\r\n  |      High level      |[1,500,000]|  1700}  |   60     |    6·0    |\r\n  |      Low level       |  [700,000]|   800}  |          |           |\r\n  |                      |           |         +----------+-----------+\r\n  |                      |           |         |   93     |    9·3    |\r\n  |                      |           |         |= 4 parts nitrogen per|\r\n  |                      |           |         |1,000,000 of soil.    |\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+---------+----------------------+\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------\r\n  |          LARGER ORGANISMS.\r\n  +-----------------+-------------------+\r\n  |                 |                   |\r\n  |                 |                   +\r\n  |                 |      Numbers      |\r\n  |                 |    per Acre.[D]   |\r\n  |                 +---------+---------+\r\n  |                 |         |   Unma- |\r\n  |                 | Manured.|  nured. |\r\n  +-----------------+---------+---------+\r\n  |_Oligochaeta_    |         |         |\r\n  |  (_Limicolae_)--|         |         |\r\n  |  Nematoda, etc. |3,609,000|  794,000|\r\n  |  Myriapoda      |1,781,000|  879,000|\r\n  |  Insects        |7,727,000|2,475,000|\r\n  |  Earthworms     |1,010,000|  458,000|\r\n  +-----------------+---------+---------+\r\n  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                 LARGER ORGANISMS.                         |\r\n  +-----------------+-----------------------------------------+\r\n  |                 |     Approximate Weight per Acre of--    |\r\n  |                 +-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |                 |    Living   |  Dry Matter | Nitrogen in |\r\n  |                 |  Organisms. |in Organisms.| Organisms.  |\r\n  |                 +------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                 |  Ma- | Unma-|  Ma- | Unma-|  Ma- |Unma- |\r\n  |                 |nured.|nured.|nured.|nured.|nured.|nured.|\r\n  +-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |_Oligochaeta_    |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |  (_Limicolae_)--|  lb. |  lb. |  lb. |  lb. |  lb. |  lb. |\r\n  |  Nematoda, etc. |    9 |    2 |    3 |    1 |   -- |   -- |\r\n  |  Myriapoda      |  203 |   99 |   85 |   42 |    4 |    2 |\r\n  |  Insects        |   34 |   16 |   14 |    6 |    1 |    1 |\r\n  |  Earthworms     |  472 |  217 |  108 |   50 |   10 |    5 |\r\n  +-----------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                        Total  | 210  |  99  |   15 |    9 |\r\n  +-------------------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\n  Total organic matter (dry weight) in this soil = 126,000 lb. per acre.\r\n\r\n  Total nitrogen = 5700 lb. per acre. (1 lb. nitrogen per acre = 0·4\r\n  parts per 1,000,000 of soil.)\r\n\r\n  [D] To a depth of 9 inches. The weight of soil is approximately\r\n  1,000,000 kilos.\r\n\r\nAre there any other members of the soil population that are of\r\nimportance? As already shown, the method of investigating the soil\r\npopulation in use at Rothamsted is to find by chemical methods the\r\nchanges going on in the soil; to find by biological methods what\r\norganisms are capable of bringing about these changes; and then to\r\ncomplete the chain of evidence by tracing the relationships between\r\nthe numbers or activities of these organisms and the amount of change\r\nproduced. The list as we know it to-day is given in Table I.\r\n\r\nThe method, however, does not indicate whether the account is fairly\r\ncomplete, or whether there are other organisms to be found. We might,\r\nof course, trust to empirical hunting for organisms, or to chance\r\ndiscoveries such as led Goodey to find the mysterious Proteomyxan\r\nRhizopods, which cannot yet be cultured with certainty, so that they\r\nare rarely found by soil workers. It is possible that there are many\r\nsuch organisms, and it is even conceivable that these unknown forms far\r\noutnumber the known. The defect of the present method is that it always\r\nleaves us in doubt as to the completeness of the list, and so we may\r\nhave to devise another.\r\n\r\nReverting to Table I., it obviously serves no purpose to add the\r\nnumbers of all the organisms together. We can add up the weights of\r\nliving organisms, of their dry matter or nitrogen, so as to form some\r\nidea of the proportion of living to non-living organic matter, and this\r\nhelps us to visualise the different groups and place them according\r\nto their respective masses. But a much better basis for comparing the\r\nactivities of the different groups would be afforded by the respective\r\namounts of energy they transform, if these could be determined. It is\r\nproposed to attempt such measurements at Rothamsted. The results when\r\nadded would give the sum of the energy changes effected by the soil\r\npopulation as we know it: the figure could be compared with the total\r\nenergy change in the soil itself as determined in a calorimeter. If\r\nthe two figures are of the same order of magnitude, we shall know that\r\nour list is fairly well complete; if they are widely different, search\r\nmust be made for the missing energy transformers. There are, of course,\r\nserious experimental difficulties to be overcome, but we believe the\r\nenergy relationships will afford the best basis for further work on the\r\nsoil population.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is necessary to refer to the physical conditions obtaining\r\nin the soil. These make it a much better habitat for organisms than one\r\nmight expect. At first sight one thinks of the soil as a purely mineral\r\nmass. This view is entirely incorrect. Soil contains a considerable\r\namount of plant residues, rich in energy, and of air and water. The\r\nusual method of stating the composition of the soil is by weight, but\r\nthis is misleading to the biologist because the mineral matter has a\r\ndensity some two and a half times that of water and three times that\r\nof the organic matter. For biological purposes composition by volume\r\nis much more useful, and when stated in this way the figures are very\r\ndifferent from those ordinarily given. Table II. gives the results for\r\ntwo Broadbalk arable plots, one unmanured and the other dunged; it\r\nincludes also a pasture soil.\r\n\r\nThe first requirement of the soil population is a supply of energy,\r\nwithout which it cannot live at all. All our evidence shows that the\r\nmagnitude of the population is limited by the quantity of energy\r\navailable. The percentage by weight of the organic matter is about\r\ntwo to four or five, and the percentage by volume runs about four\r\nto twelve. Not all of this, however, is of equal value as source of\r\nenergy. About one-half is fairly easily soluble in alkalis, and may\r\nor may not be of special value, but about one-quarter is probably too\r\nstable to be of use to soil organisms.\r\n\r\nA second requirement is water with which in this country the soil is\r\nusually tolerably well provided. Even in prolonged dry weather the soil\r\nis moist at a depth of 3 inches below the surface. It is not uncommon\r\nto find 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. by volume of water present, spread\r\nin a thin film over all the particles, and completely saturating the\r\nsoil atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\nVOLUME OF AIR, WATER AND ORGANIC MATTER IN 100 VOLUMES OF ROTHAMSTED\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\n  +---+-----------------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |   |                 |           |In Pore Space.|\r\n  |   |                 |           |Values Common-|\r\n  |   |  Solid Matter.  |           | ly Obtained. |\r\n  |   +--------+--------+           +-------+------+\r\n  |   |Mineral.|Organic.|Pore Space.| Water.| Air. |\r\n  +---+--------+--------+-----------+-------+------+\r\n  |(1)|   62   |    4   |    34     |   23  |  11  |\r\n  |(2)|   51   |   11   |    38     |   30  |   8  |\r\n  |(3)|   41   |   12   |    47     |   40  |   7  |\r\n  +---+--------+--------+-----------+-------+------+\r\n\r\n  (1) Arable, no manure applied to soil.\r\n\r\n  (2) Arable, dung applied to soil.\r\n\r\n  (3) Pasture.\r\n\r\nThe air supply is usually adequate owing to the rapidity with which\r\ndiffusion takes place. Except when the soil is water-logged, the\r\natmosphere differs but little from that of the one we breathe. There\r\nis more CO₂, but only a little less oxygen.[8] The mean temperature is\r\nhigher than one would expect, being distinctly above that of the air,\r\nwhile the fluctuations in temperature are less.[5]\r\n\r\nThe reaction in normal soils is neutral to faintly alkaline; _p_H\r\nvalues of nearly 8 are not uncommon. Results from certain English soils\r\nare shown on p. 18.\r\n\r\nThe soil reaction is not easily altered. A considerable amount of acid\r\nmust accumulate before any marked increase in intensity of _p_H value\r\noccurs; in other words, the soil is well buffered. The same can be said\r\nof temperature, of water, and of energy supply. Like the reaction, they\r\nalter but slowly, so that organisms have considerable time in which to\r\nadapt themselves to the change.\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN ION CONCENTRATION AND SOIL FERTILITY.\r\n\r\n                 _p_H\r\n  Alkaline    10 --+-- Sterile: Alkali soil.\r\n    ↑              |\r\n    |          9 --+--\r\n    |              |\r\n    |          8 --+-- Fertile: Arable.\r\n    |              |\r\n  Neutral      7 --+--\r\n    |              |\r\n    |          6 --+--\r\n    |              |\r\n    |          5 --+-- Potato Scab fails.\r\n    |              |   Nitrification hindered.\r\n    |          4 --+-- Barley fails.\r\n    ↓              |\r\n  Acid         3 --+-- Sterile: Peat.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n  [1] Berthelot, Marcellin, “Fixation directe de l’azote atmosphérique\r\n  libre par certains terrains argileux,” Compt.

Although bacteria were first seen\r\nby Leeuwenhoeck about the middle of the seventeenth century, and\r\nsome of their forms described by microscopists of the eighteenth and\r\nearly nineteenth centuries, it was only with the work of Pasteur on\r\nfermentation, and of Duvaine, Pasteur, and their contemporaries on\r\ndisease bacteria, that bacteriology may be said to have started.\r\nFrom the outset, therefore, attention has been directed mainly to\r\nthe bacteria in their specialised relationship to disease or to\r\nfermentation and similar processes. As a result, little research was\r\ndone on the pure biology of the bacteria, so that even now many of the\r\nmost fundamental and elementary problems concerning them are quite\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\nIn their work on fermentations and disease bacteria, the earlier\r\nworkers were assisted by the fact that under both sets of conditions\r\nthe causative bacteria exist, as a rule, either in practically pure\r\nculture, or else in preponderating numbers. The study and elucidation\r\nof such a mixed micro-population as exists in the soil, became possible\r\nonly when methods had been devised for isolating the different kinds\r\nof bacteria, and thus studying them apart from each other. It was the\r\ndevelopment of the gelatine plate method of isolating pure cultures by\r\nKoch[36] in 1881 that made the study of the soil bacteria practicable.\r\nThe plating method opened up two lines of research. In the first\r\nplace, it provided a simple means of isolating organisms from the mixed\r\npopulation of the soil, and thus enabled a qualitative study to be made\r\nof each organism in pure culture, and, in the second place, from it was\r\ndeveloped a counting technique for estimating differences in bacterial\r\nnumbers between samples of soil, from which has sprung much of our\r\nknowledge of the quantitative side.\r\n\r\nThe earliest studies of the soil bacteria consisted of such estimations\r\nof numbers, and showed that the soil contained a very numerous\r\npopulation of bacteria. About 20,000,000 bacteria per gram of soil\r\nis now considered a fair average number. The number and variety of\r\nbacteria existing in the soil is so enormous that the method of\r\nseparating out all the different forms, and of discovering their\r\ncharacters and functions, has proved impracticable. In practice,\r\ntherefore, the problem has been approached from the biochemical\r\nstandpoint. That is to say, the special chemical changes that the\r\nbacteria produce in the soil have first been investigated, and this\r\nhas been followed by the isolation and study of the various groups of\r\nbacteria that bring about the changes under investigation.\r\n\r\nThe method commonly employed in isolating the organisms that produce a\r\ngiven chemical change in the soil is called the “elective” method. The\r\nsoil is inoculated into a culture medium that will especially favour\r\nthe group of bacteria to be isolated, to the exclusion of others.\r\nFor example, if it is desired to isolate the organisms that attack\r\ncellulose, a medium is made up containing no other organic carbon\r\ncompounds except cellulose. Such a selective medium encourages the\r\ngrowth of the group of organisms to be investigated, so that after\r\nseveral transfers to fresh medium a culture is obtained containing\r\nonly two or three different types of organisms. These are separated by\r\nplating and pure cultures obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty which has not yet been completely overcome is\r\nthat of adequately describing an organism when it is isolated. The\r\nmorphology of bacteria is not the constant thing that is seen in\r\nthe more stable higher organisms. In many cases the appearance of a\r\nsingle strain is entirely different on different media, and may be\r\nquite altered by such conditions as changes in acidity of the medium\r\nor temperature of incubation. Even on a single medium remarkable\r\nchanges in morphology occur, at any rate, in some bacteria. This is\r\nwell seen in a cresol-decomposing organism under investigation at\r\nRothamsted. In cultures a few days old this organism develops as bent\r\nand branching rods; these rods then break up into chains of cocci and\r\nshort rods, which separate, and in old cultures all the organisms\r\nmay be in the coccoid form (Fig. 1). It is claimed by Löhnis[47_b_]\r\nthat the possession of a complex life-cycle of changing forms is a\r\nuniversal character in the bacteria. The instability of shape in many\r\nbacteria makes it necessary to standardise very carefully the cultural\r\nconditions under which they are kept when their appearance is described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCulture 15 hours old.\r\n\r\nCulture 3 days old.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.--Change in appearance, in culture, of a cresol decomposing\r\nbacterium.]\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of mere morphology as a basis for describing bacteria\r\nled to the search for diagnostic characters, based on the biochemical\r\nchanges that they produced in their culture media, and the appearance\r\nof their growth in the mass on various media. These characters\r\nunfortunately have also proved to be very much influenced by the exact\r\ncomposition of the medium and other conditions of culture. Recently\r\nan attempt has been made by the American Society of Bacteriologists to\r\nstandardise the diagnostic characters used in describing bacteria, and\r\nalso the media and cultural conditions under which they are grown for\r\nthe purpose of description. The need for such precautions, however,\r\nwas not sufficiently realised by the early workers, many of whose\r\ndescriptions cannot now be referred to any definite organism.\r\n\r\nThe large number of organisms found in the soil, and the difficulty\r\nand labour of adequately describing them, is such that even now we\r\nhave no comprehensive description of the common soil bacteria that\r\nappear on gelatine platings. A careful study based on modern methods of\r\ncharacterisation has been made of certain selected groups of bacteria,\r\nand it is hoped that the laborious systematic work of describing the\r\ncommon forms will gradually be completed.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to classify the bacteria that appear\r\ncommonly on gelatine platings. This work was commenced by Hiltner and\r\nStormer in Germany, and continued by Chester, Harding, and Conn in\r\nAmerica. Conn[10],[14] found that the common organisms fell into the\r\nfollowing main groups:--\r\n\r\n(1) Large spore-forming bacteria, related to _Bacillus subtilis_, which\r\nform about 5-10 per cent. of the numbers. He adduced evidence[12],[13]\r\nthat these organisms exist in the soil mainly as spores, so that they\r\nmay not form an important part of the active soil population.\r\n\r\n(2) Short non-sporing organisms, related to _Pseudomonas fluorescens_,\r\nthat are rapid gelatine liquefiers. These form another 10 per cent. of\r\nthe numbers.\r\n\r\n(3) Short rod forms that liquefy gelatine slowly or not at all, and\r\ndevelop colonies very slowly. These form 40-75 per cent. of the\r\nnumbers, and may therefore be of considerable importance in the soil.\r\n\r\n(4) A few micrococci also occur.\r\n\r\nThese groups comprise the larger portion of the bacterial flora of the\r\nsoil, but, in addition to these organisms, that develop on the media\r\ncommonly used for plating, there are special and important groups\r\nthat appear only on special media, either owing to their being unable\r\nto grow on ordinary media or because they get swamped by other forms.\r\nExamples of such groups are the ammonia and nitrite oxidising bacteria,\r\nthe nitrogen fixing groups, the cellulose decomposing organisms, and\r\nthe sulphur bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may apply the results of the study of a definite\r\norganism to other localities, a knowledge of the geographical\r\ndistribution of the soil bacteria is clearly needed. We have,\r\nunfortunately, very little knowledge of the distribution of soil\r\norganisms. The common spore-forming groups appear to be universally\r\ndistributed. Thus Barthel, in a study of the bacterial flora of soils\r\nfrom Greenland and the island of Disko, obtained soil organisms\r\nbelonging to the groups of _Bacillus subtilis_, _B. amylobacter_, _B.\r\nfluorescens_, _B. caudatus_, and _B. Zopfii_, which are common groups\r\nin European soil, indicating that the general constitution of the\r\nbacterial flora of the soil in arctic regions is not widely different\r\nfrom that of Western Europe. Bredemann, who made an extensive study of\r\nthe _Bacillus amylobacter_ group, obtained soil samples from widely\r\nscattered localities, and found these organisms in soil from Germany,\r\nHolstein, Norway, Italy, Morocco, Teneriffe, Russia, Japan, China,\r\nthe East Indies, Samoa, Illinois, Arizona, German East Africa, and\r\nthe Cameroons. Some soil organisms, on the other hand, are apparently\r\nabsent from certain districts. This may be due to the conditions,\r\nsuch as climatic environment, being unfavourable to them. A study has\r\nrecently been made at Rothamsted of the distribution over Great Britain\r\nof a group of bacteria that are capable of decomposing phenol and\r\ncresol. One of these organisms, apparently related to the acid-fast\r\n_B. phlœi_, has an interesting distribution. It has been found in 50\r\nper cent. of the soils samples examined from the drier region, where\r\nthe annual rainfall is less than 30 inches, but in only 20 per cent.\r\nof the samples in the wetter parts of Britain. Another example of\r\nlimited distribution is found in the case of _Bacillus radicicola_,\r\nthe organism that produces tubercles on the roots of leguminous plants.\r\nThe distribution of the varieties of this organism follows that of\r\nthe host plants with which they are associated, so that when a new\r\nleguminous crop is introduced into a country, nodules may not appear\r\non the roots unless the soil be specially inoculated with the right\r\nvariety of organism. In cases where a group of soil organisms is widely\r\ndistributed over the globe, it may yet be absent from many soils\r\nowing to the soil conditions not suiting it. Thus, phenol decomposing\r\nbacteria, though abundant in the neighbourhood of Rothamsted, are yet\r\nabsent from field plots that have been unmanured for a considerable\r\nperiod. The occurrence of the nitrifying organisms and the nitrogen\r\nfixing _Azotobacter_ is also very dependent on the soil conditions.\r\n\r\nOwing to the method by which our knowledge of soil bacteria has been\r\nacquired, by studying first the chemical changes in the soil and then\r\nthe bacteria that produce them, it is natural for us to divide them\r\ninto physiological groups according to the chemical changes that they\r\nbring about. This grouping is the more reasonable since so little is\r\nknown as to the true relationships of the different groups of bacteria\r\nthat a classification based on morphology is well-nigh impossible. In\r\nconsidering the activities of bacteria in the soil, it is convenient to\r\ngroup the changes which they bring about into the two divisions into\r\nwhich they naturally fall in the economy of the organisms.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are the changes that result in a release of\r\nenergy, which the bacteria utilise for their vital processes.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there are the processes by which the bacteria\r\nbuild up the material of their bodies. These building up processes\r\ninvolve an intake of energy for their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the release of energy for\r\ntheir own use by bacteria, and its consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n_B._ ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE ACQUIREMENT OF ENERGY.\r\n\r\nUnlike the green plants, most bacteria are unable to obtain the energy\r\nthat is required for their metabolism from sunlight. They must,\r\ntherefore, make use of such chemical changes as will involve the\r\nrelease of energy.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the acquirement of energy in this way may be taken the\r\noxidation of methane by _B. methanicus_. This organism, described by\r\nSöhngen, obtains its energy supply by the conversion of methane into\r\nCO₂ and H₂O.\r\n\r\n  CH₄ + 2O₂ = CO₂ + 2H₂O 220 Cal.\r\n\r\nA further example is the acetic organism that obtains its energy\r\nthrough the oxidation of alcohol to acetic acid.\r\n\r\n  C₂H₆O + O₂ = C₂H₄O₂ + H₂O 115 Cal.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition processes brought about by micro-organisms in\r\nobtaining energy are usually oxidations, but this is not necessarily\r\nso, as can be seen in case of the fermentation of sugar into alcohol.[E]\r\n\r\n  C₆H₁₂O₆ = 2C₂H₆O + 2CO₂ 50 Cal.\r\n\r\n  [E] These examples are from Orla-Jensen (Centralblatt f. Bakt., II.,\r\n  Bd. 22, p. 305).\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the decomposition of organic matter is\r\nbrought about by bacteria in the process of acquiring energy. In the\r\nsoil, nearly the whole of the material utilised by bacteria as a source\r\nof energy is derived ultimately from green plants. The energy materials\r\nleft in the soil by the plant fall into two groups, the non-nitrogenous\r\ncompounds, which are mainly carbohydrates and their derivatives, and\r\nthe nitrogenous compounds, principally derived from proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _Decomposition of Non-nitrogenous Compounds._\r\n\r\nThe simpler carbohydrates and starches are attacked and decomposed by\r\na large variety of bacteria. The addition of such substances to soil\r\ncauses a rapid increase in bacterial numbers. In nature the sugars are\r\nin all probability among the first plant constituents to be destroyed\r\nduring the decay processes.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of plant tissues consist of cellulose and its\r\nderivatives. These compounds are consequently of great importance\r\nin the soil. Unfortunately our knowledge of the processes by which\r\ncellulose is broken down in the soil is very inadequate. The early\r\nexperimental study of cellulose decomposition, such as that of\r\nTappeiner[60] and Hoppe-Seyler,[33] was mostly carried out under\r\nconditions of inadequate aeration, and the products of decomposition\r\nwere found to include methane and CO₂, and sometimes fatty acids and\r\nhydrogen. The bacteriology of this anaerobic decomposition was studied\r\nby Omelianski,[54] who described two spore-bearing organisms, one of\r\nwhich attacked cellulose with the production of hydrogen, and the other\r\nwith the production of methane. Both species also produce fatty acids\r\nand CO₂. It is probable that these organisms operate in the soil under\r\nconditions of inadequate aeration. In swamp soils, in which rice is\r\ngrown, it has been shown that methane, hydrogen, and CO₂ are evolved\r\nin the lower layers. In these soils, however, the methane and hydrogen\r\nare oxidised when they reach the surface layers. This oxidation is\r\nalso effected by micro-organisms. Bacteria capable of deriving energy\r\nby the oxidation of hydrogen gas have been isolated and studied by\r\nKaserer,[37] and by Nabokich and Lebedeff,[52] while Söhngen[57] has\r\nisolated an organism which he named _Bacillus methanicus_, that was\r\ncapable of oxidising methane.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions in cultivated soils, however, the decomposition\r\nof cellulose takes place in the presence of an adequate air supply,\r\nand so follows a different course from that studied by Omelianski. Our\r\nknowledge of this aerobic decomposition is very scanty. A number of\r\nbacteria, capable of decomposing cellulose aerobically, are known. A\r\nremarkable organism was investigated by Hutchinson and Clayton,[30]\r\nwho named it _Spirochæta cytophaga_. This organism, which they isolated\r\nfrom Rothamsted soil, though placed among the _Spirochætoidea_, is\r\nof doubtful affinities. During the active condition it exists for\r\nthe most part as thin flexible rods tapered at the extremities. This\r\nform passes into a spherical cyst-like stage, at first thought to be\r\na distinct organism (Fig. 2). _Spirochæta cytophaga_ is very aerobic,\r\nworking actively, only at the surface of the culture medium. It is\r\nvery selective in its action. It appears unable to derive energy from\r\nany carbohydrate other than cellulose. Indeed, many of the simple\r\ncarbohydrates, especially the reducing sugars, are toxic to the\r\norganism in pure culture. An extensive study of aerobic cellulose\r\ndecomposition by bacteria was made by McBeth and Scales,[50] who\r\nisolated fifteen bacteria having this power. Five of these were\r\nspore-forming organisms. Unlike _Spirochæta cytophaga_, they are all\r\nable to develop on ordinary media such as beef agar or gelatine, and\r\nare thus not nearly so selective in their food requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--_Spirochæta cytophaga._ Changes occurring in\r\nculture. (After HUTCHINSON and CLAYTON.)]\r\n\r\nWe are at present ignorant as to which organisms are most effective\r\nin decomposing cellulose in the soil under field conditions, or what\r\nare the conditions best suited to their activity. It is possible that\r\nfungi also help in the decomposition of cellulose to a great extent.\r\nThis subject of the decomposition of cellulose offers one of the most\r\npromising fields of research in soil bacteriology. The difficulty\r\nof the subject is further increased by our present ignorance of the\r\nchemical aspect of cellulose decomposition. It has been supposed that\r\nthe early decomposition products are simpler sugars, but these are\r\nnot found under conditions in which cellulose is being decomposed by\r\npure cultures of the bacteria mentioned above. Hutchinson and Clayton\r\nfound that their organism produced volatile acids, mucilage, and a\r\ncarotin-like pigment. The organisms isolated by McBeth and Scales also\r\nproduce acids, and in some cases yellow pigments. It is known, however,\r\nthat the decomposition products of cellulose can be utilised as energy\r\nsupply for other organisms, such as nitrogen fixing bacteria.\r\n\r\nWhen plant remains decompose in the soil there are ultimately produced\r\nbrown colloidal bodies collectively known as humus. The processes by\r\nwhich this humus is produced are not yet properly understood. Humus is\r\nof great importance in the soil, in rendering the soil suitable for\r\nthe growth of crops. It affects the physical properties of the soil\r\nto a great extent. In the first place, it improves the texture of the\r\nsoil, making heavy clay soils more friable, and loose sandy soils more\r\ncoherent. Secondly, it has great water-retaining powers, so that soils\r\nrich in organic matter suffer comparatively little during periods of\r\ndrought. And lastly, it exerts a strong buffering effect against soil\r\nacids. Now, it is one of the problems of present-day farming that\r\nsoil is becoming depleted of its humus. This is due to the increasing\r\nscarcity of farmyard manure in many districts, and the consequent use\r\nof mineral fertilisers to supply nitrogen, potash, and phosphate to\r\nthe crop. A need has therefore arisen for a substitute for farmyard\r\nmanure, by means of which the humus content of soils may be kept up in\r\ndistricts where natural manure is scarce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Cellulose decomposed by _S. cytophaga_ in media\r\nwith increasing amounts of nitrogen. (After HUTCHINSON and CLAYTON.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis: Milligrams of nitrogen supplied as sodium-ammonium phosphate.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Milligrams of cellulose decomposed in 21 days.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that if fresh unrotted manure or straw be added to\r\nthe soil, it often produces harmful effects on the succeeding crop.\r\nThe problem, therefore, was to develop a method by which fresh straw,\r\nbefore application to the soil, could be made to rot down to a mixture\r\nof humus compounds such as occur in well-rotted farmyard manure. The\r\nsolution of this problem came as a result of an investigation by\r\nHutchinson and Richards,[30_b_] at Rothamsted, into food requirements\r\nof the cellulose decomposing bacteria. They realised that since more\r\nthan 10 per cent. of the dry weight of bacteria consists of nitrogen,\r\nit would be necessary to supply the cellulose decomposing bacteria with\r\na supply of nitrogen, in order that they should attain their greatest\r\nactivity. Experiments with cultures of _Spirochæta cytophaga_ showed\r\nthat the amount of cellulose decomposed depended upon an adequate\r\nsupply of nitrogen for the organism (Fig. 3). Similarly, materials such\r\nas straw will scarcely decompose at all if wetted with pure water. An\r\nadequate supply of nitrogen compounds is needed to enable decomposition\r\nto take place. Hutchinson and Richards tested the effect of ammonium\r\nsulphate, and discovered experimentally the proportion of ammonia to\r\nstraw that produced the most rapid decomposition. They found that if\r\na straw heap was treated with the correct proportion of ammonia, it\r\ndecomposed into a brown substance having the appearance of well-rotted\r\nmanure. This has resulted in the development of a commercial process\r\nfor making synthetic farmyard manure from straw. The method of\r\nmanufacture is as follows: A straw stack is made and thoroughly wetted\r\nwith water. The correct amount of ammonium sulphate is then sprinkled\r\non the top and wetted, so that the solution percolates through the\r\nstraw. The cellulose bacteria attack the straw, breaking it down\r\nand assimilating the ammonia. This ammonia is not wasted, as it is\r\nconverted into bacterial protoplasm that eventually decays in the soil.\r\nField trials of this synthetic manure show that it produces an effect\r\nclosely similar to that of natural farmyard manure.\r\n\r\nWhile cellulose and related carbohydrates are by far the most\r\nimportant non-nitrogenous compounds left in the soil by plants, there\r\nare other compounds whose destruction by bacteria is of special\r\ninterest. Such, for example, is the case of phenol. This compound is\r\nproduced by bacterial action as a decomposition product of certain\r\namino-acids. It occurs in appreciable amounts in cow urine. It is\r\nprobable that it forms a common decomposition product in soil and\r\nalso in farmyard manure. If this phenol were to persist in the soil,\r\nit would eventually reach a concentration harmful to plant growth. It\r\ndoes not, however, accumulate in the soil; indeed, if pure phenol or\r\ncresol be added to ordinary arable soil, a rapid disappearance occurs.\r\nThis disappearance is of some practical importance, since it limits\r\nthe commercial use of these compounds as soil sterilising agents.\r\nThe cause of the disappearance has been to some extent elucidated at\r\nRothamsted,[58] where it was found to be in part a purely chemical\r\nreaction with certain soil constituents, and partly due to the activity\r\nof bacteria capable of decomposing it. A large number of soil bacteria\r\nhave now been isolated that can decompose phenol, meta-, para-, and\r\northo-cresol, and are able to use these substances as the sole sources\r\nof energy for their life processes. These organisms have a wide\r\ndistribution, having been found in soil samples taken from all over\r\nGreat Britain, from Norway, the Tyrol, Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha\r\nand South Georgia. Soil bacteria have also been isolated that are able\r\nto decompose and derive their energy from naphthalene and from toluene.\r\nThe ability of the bacteria to break up the naphthalene is very\r\nremarkable, and all the more so since they can hardly have come across\r\nthis compound in the state of nature. The naphthalene organisms have a\r\ndistribution as world-wide as the phenol group.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) _Ammonia Production._\r\n\r\nThe second main group of products left in the soil by higher plants\r\nare the nitrogen-containing compounds, such as the proteins and\r\namino-acids. Plant remains are not the only source of organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds available to soil bacteria. There are, in addition, the dead\r\nbodies of other soil organisms, such as protozoa and algæ. The relative\r\nimportance of these sources of nitrogen is not known, but almost\r\ncertainly varies greatly with the state of activity of the various\r\ngroups of the soil population. Bacteria are able to utilise organic\r\nnitrogen compounds as energy sources, as can be exemplified in the\r\noxidation of a simple amino-acid:--\r\n\r\n     H    O\r\n     |   //\r\n  H--C--C   + 3O = 2CO₂ + H₂O + NH₃ + 152 Cal.\r\n     |   \\\r\n    NH₂  OH\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, in the acquirement of energy from such a\r\ncompound, ammonia is released as a by-product. It is not certainly\r\nknown what is the exact course of the reactions brought about by\r\nbacteria in soil during the breaking-down of organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds, but they result in the splitting off of most of the nitrogen\r\nas ammonia. Herein lies the great importance of the process, for the\r\nproduction of ammonia is an essential stage in the formation of nitrate\r\nin the soil, and on the supply of nitrate the growth of most crops\r\nlargely depends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Quantities of ammonia produced by pure cultures\r\nfrom 5 grams of casein in the presence of varying quantities of\r\ndextrose. (After DORYLAND.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis: Percentage of dextrose added.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Milligrams of NH₃ produced.]\r\n\r\nIt is very important to note that the production of this ammonia is\r\nonly a by-product in the economy of the bacteria, the benefit that they\r\nderive from the reactions being due to the release of energy involved\r\nin the decomposition. The common ammonia-producing bacteria in the\r\nsoil have been found equally capable of deriving their energy by the\r\noxidation of sugars and similar non-nitrogenous compounds. Fig. 4\r\nshows an experiment by Doryland,[17] in which cultures of common soil\r\nbacteria were grown in peptone solution, to which increasing quantities\r\nof sugar were added. One can see that, as the amount of sugar is\r\nincreased, the production of ammonia is lowered, since the bacteria\r\nare obtaining energy from the sugar instead of from the nitrogen\r\ncompound, peptone. Consequently, if soil contains a quantity of easily\r\ndecomposible carbohydrate material, bacteria will derive their energy\r\nfrom this source, and the production of ammonia and nitrate will be\r\nlowered. Thus the addition of sugar or unrotted straw to the soil often\r\nlowers the nitrate production, and consequently reduces the crop yield.\r\nIf the soil is sufficiently rich in carbohydrate material, the bacteria\r\nmay multiply until the supply of organic nitrogen is used up, and\r\nthen will actually assimilate some of the ammonia and nitrate already\r\nexisting. There is thus a balance of conditions in the soil due to\r\nvarying proportions of nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous energy material.\r\nWhen nitrogen compounds are the predominant energy source, the bacteria\r\nutilise them, and ammonia is released. When a non-nitrogenous energy\r\nsource predominates, this is utilised and little or no ammonia is\r\nreleased, and in extreme cases ammonia may be assimilated.\r\n\r\nAlthough a large number of the common organisms in the soil produce\r\nammonia in culture media containing peptone, the relative importance\r\nof these in the soil has yet to be decided. It was supposed that the\r\nspore-forming organisms related to _Bacillus mycoides_ were of chief\r\nimportance. This supposition dates from the work of Marchal,[49] who\r\nstudied the production of ammonia by an organism of this group in\r\nculture solution, and found it to be a very active ammonifier. As\r\nalready mentioned, however, there is some doubt as to whether the large\r\nspore-forming organisms are very active under soil conditions.[12],[13]\r\nThe existence of rapid fluctuations in nitrate content, found to exist\r\nin soil, may in the future indicate which are the most active of the\r\ncommon bacteria in the soil itself by enabling us to observe which\r\ntypes increase during periods of rapid ammonia and nitrate formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) _Nitrate Production._\r\n\r\nThe ammonia produced in the soil under normal field conditions is\r\nrapidly oxidised successively to nitrite and to nitrate, a process\r\nknown as nitrification. The process of nitrification is more rapid than\r\nthat of ammonia production, with the consequence that no more than\r\ntraces of ammonia are able to accumulate. The rate at which nitrate is\r\nformed in the soil is consequently set by the slower process of ammonia\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe work of Schloesing and of Warington showed that the oxidation\r\nof ammonia was the work of living organisms. It is, however, to\r\nWinogradsky’s isolation and study of the causative organisms that we\r\nowe our present knowledge of the biology of the process. By a new\r\nand ingenious technique, he isolated from soil two remarkable groups\r\nof bacteria that bring about nitrification. The first group oxidises\r\nammonium carbonate to nitrite, and was divided by Winogradsky into\r\nthe two genera, _Nitrosomonas_, a very short rod-like organism bearing\r\na single flagellum, and _Nitrosococcus_, a non-motile form found in\r\nSouth America. The second group oxidises nitrites to nitrates. They are\r\nminute pear-shaped rods to which he gave the name _Nitrobacter_.\r\n\r\nWinogradsky found that the first, or nitrite-producing group, would\r\nlive in a culture solution containing:--\r\n\r\n  2·25 grams ammonium sulphate,\r\n  2·0    „   sodium chloride,\r\n  1·0    „   magnesium carbonate,\r\n       to the litre of well water.\r\n\r\nNitrobacter would grow in a similar medium containing sodium nitrite\r\ninstead of ammonium sulphate. There being no organic carbon in these\r\nmedia, the organisms had no source of carbon for their nutrition,\r\nexcept the CO₂ of the air, or possibly that of bicarbonate in solution.\r\nIt therefore followed that the organisms must obtain their carbon\r\nsupply from one of these sources. Unlike green plants, the nitrous and\r\nnitric organisms are able to carry on this carbon assimilation in the\r\ndark, and must therefore obtain the energy needed for the process from\r\nsome chemical reaction. The only sources of energy in Winogradsky’s\r\nsolutions were the nitrogen compounds, and it consequently followed\r\nthat the organisms must derive their energy supply by the oxidation\r\nof ammonia and nitrite respectively. The release of energy obtained\r\nby these two reactions has been calculated by Orla-Jensen to be as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  (NH₄)₂CO₃ + 3O₂ = 2HNO₂ + CO₂ + 3H₂O + 148 Cals.\r\n\r\n         KNO₂ + O = KNO₃ + 22 Cals.\r\n\r\nThe exact process by which ammonium carbonate is converted into nitrite\r\nis not at present known. The two groups of organisms are extremely\r\nselective in their source of energy. The nitrous organisms can derive\r\ntheir energy only by the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, and the\r\nnitric organisms only by the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. In\r\nculture media they are, indeed, inhibited by soluble organic compounds\r\nsuch as sugars. Under natural conditions, however, they appear to\r\nbe less sensitive, since ammonium carbonate is readily nitrified\r\nin substrata rich in organic matter. The rapid nitrification that\r\ntakes place during the purification of sewage is an example of this.\r\nThe conditions in culture, with regard to aeration and the removal\r\nof metabolic products from the neighbourhood of the organisms, are\r\nvery different from those in the soil, and perhaps account for the\r\ndiscrepancies found.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of ammonium carbonate by nitrosomonas results in the\r\nformation of nitrous acid. The organisms are very sensitive to acidity,\r\nand can only operate if the nitrous acid produced is neutralised by an\r\navailable base. In normal soils calcium carbonate supplies this base,\r\nand in acid soils the formation of nitrite is, as a rule, increased\r\nby the addition of lime, or of calcium or magnesium carbonate. There\r\nis evidence that in the absence of calcium carbonate, other compounds\r\ncan be used as a base. It was found by Hopkins and Whiting[32] that\r\nin culture solution the nitrifying organisms could use insoluble rock\r\nphosphate as a base, producing therefrom the soluble acid phosphate.\r\nThere is evidence, however, that in ordinary soil containing calcium\r\ncarbonate very little solution of phosphate takes place in this way.\r\nThe further oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by _Nitrobacter_ does not\r\nproduce acid, and requires no further neutralising base.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate produced in this way is the main source of nitrogen supply\r\nto plants under normal conditions. Experiments have shown that a number\r\nof plants are capable of utilising ammonia as a source of nitrogen, and\r\nHesselmann[34] has found forest soils in Sweden where no nitrification\r\nwas proceeding, and where, therefore, plants would presumably obtain\r\ntheir nitrogen in this way, but such cases must be regarded as\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nAnother group of bacteria capable of deriving their energy from\r\nan inorganic source exists in the soil. This comprises the sulphur\r\nbacteria, which are able to derive energy by the oxidation of sulphur,\r\nsulphides, or thiosulphates to sulphuric acid:--\r\n\r\n  S + 3O + H₂O = H₂SO₄ + 141 Cals.\r\n\r\nOne organism studied by Waksman and Joffe[63] is able to live in\r\ninorganic solution, deriving its carbon from carbon dioxide. The\r\nsulphur bacteria have recently come into prominence in America owing to\r\ntheir faculty for producing acid. Thus Thiospirillum will increase the\r\nacidity of its medium to a reaction of P_{H} 1·0 before growth ceases.\r\nThe potato scab disease in America is now treated by composting with\r\nsulphur. This treatment depends on the production of sulphuric acid by\r\nthe sulphur oxidising bacteria, which renders the soil too acid for the\r\nparasite. There is some evidence also that acid thus produced can be\r\nused to render insoluble phosphatic manures more available in the soil.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the sulphur organisms are certain bacteria isolated from\r\nsheep dig tanks in South Africa by Green,[28_b_] which can derive\r\nenergy by the oxidation of sodium arsenite to arsenate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) _Anaerobic Respiration._\r\n\r\nAs is seen in the examples mentioned, energy is commonly obtained by\r\nbacteria through an oxidation process in which free oxygen is utilised.\r\nIn water-logged soil, however, or in soil overloaded with organic\r\nmatter, anaerobic bacteria may develop, which obtain their oxygen\r\nfrom oxidised compounds. Thus there are soil organisms described by\r\nBeijerinck[2] and others which can obtain oxygen by reducing sulphates\r\nto sulphides.\r\n\r\nA more important source of oxygen under these conditions is nitrate,\r\nwhich can supply oxygen to a larger number of bacteria. The stage to\r\nwhich the reduction can be carried varies according to the organism.\r\nA very large number of bacteria are capable of reducing nitrates to\r\nnitrites. Many can reduce nitrate to ammonia, and some can produce\r\nan evolution of nitrogen gas from nitrate. The effects of nitrate\r\nreduction, therefore, appear under water-logged conditions in soils.\r\nFor example, in swamp soils in which rice is grown, it has been found\r\nby Nagaoka,[53] in Japan, that treatment with nitrate of soda depresses\r\nthe yield, probably owing to the formation of poisonous nitrites by\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions of well aerated soil, however, it is unlikely\r\nthat the reduction of nitrate is of great importance. In such soils the\r\nactivities through which bacteria acquire their energy are, as we have\r\nseen, of vital importance to the plant, resulting in the disintegration\r\nof plant tissues, with the ultimate formation of humus, and in the\r\nproduction of nitrate.\r\n\r\nIn their activities connected with the building up of their protoplasm,\r\nbacteria may, on the other hand, compete with the plant. These\r\nactivities and their consequences will be reviewed in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSOIL BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_C._ ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THE BUILDING-UP OF BACTERIAL PROTOPLASM.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _Composition of Bacteria._\r\n\r\nThe activities of the soil bacteria that we have yet to consider are\r\nthose connected with the building-up from simpler materials of the\r\nprotoplasm of the bacterial cell. It is important to bear in mind that\r\nthis process is one requiring an expenditure of energy on the part of\r\nthe organism. The sources of energy we have already considered.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of bacteria contain the same elements common to other\r\nliving matter. Analyses of various bacteria have been made by a number\r\nof workers. About 85 per cent. of their weight is made up of water.\r\nThis analysis of Pfeiffer’s Bacillus by Cramer[15] shows the typical\r\npercentages of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and ash in the dry matter:--\r\n\r\n_Composition of Pfeiffer’s Bacillus (Cramer)._\r\n\r\n  C    50   per cent.\r\n  N    12·3    „\r\n  H     6·6    „\r\n  Ash   9·1    „\r\n\r\nAbout 65-70 per cent. of the dry matter of bacteria consists of protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) _Sources of Carbon._\r\n\r\nThe biggest constituent of the dry matter of bacteria is therefore\r\ncarbon. In the soil, bacteria find an abundance of organic matter from\r\nwhich they may derive their carbon supply. A special case, however,\r\nis furnished by the nitrifying organisms, certain sulphur oxidising\r\nbacteria, and others that derive their carbon from the CO₂ of the soil\r\natmosphere. The sources from which these special groups obtain the\r\nnecessary energy to accomplish this, we have already considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) _Assimilation of Nitrogen Compounds._\r\n\r\nOf chief importance in its consequences are the means adopted by\r\nbacteria to obtain their nitrogen supply.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to believe that soil bacteria do not take up\r\nprotein and peptones as such, but must first break down these bodies\r\ninto simpler compounds. When a sufficient amount of easily decomposable\r\norganic nitrogen is present in the soil, the ammonifying bacteria use\r\nsuch compounds as sources of energy, and in this case have a nitrogen\r\nsupply exceeding their requirements.\r\n\r\nBut where there is an excess of carbohydrate or other non-nitrogenous\r\nsource of energy available in the soil, the case is different. Here\r\nthe organisms have a supply of energy which enables them to multiply\r\nrapidly until the organic nitrogen is insufficient for their needs.\r\nHence they turn to the ammonia and nitrate present in the soil, and\r\nbuild up their proteins from this source. Doryland[17] has shown that\r\nmany common soil ammonifiers assimilate ammonia and nitrate when\r\nsupplied with carbohydrate. There may thus be a temporary loss of\r\nnitrate from soil when sugar, starch, straw, or such materials are\r\nadded to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) _Fixation of Free Nitrogen._\r\n\r\nThe bacteria that we have so far considered take up their nitrogen\r\ndirectly from compounds containing this element. There remain, however,\r\na comparatively small but very important group of bacteria possessing\r\nthe power of causing elemental nitrogen to combine, and of building it\r\nup into their proteins. This fixation of nitrogen by micro-organisms\r\nis a vital step in the economy of nature. Losses of nitrogen from the\r\nland are continually occurring through the washing-out of nitrates\r\nby rain, and through the evolution of gaseous nitrogen during the\r\nprocesses of decay. To maintain the supply of combined nitrogen\r\nwhich is essential to living organisms, there must therefore be a\r\ncompensating process by which the supply of nitrogen compounds in the\r\nsoil is kept up.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered in the middle of the nineteenth century that if soil\r\nwere kept moist and exposed to the air, there was an increase in the\r\namount of nitrogen compounds present. Berthelot, in 1893, studied the\r\nnitrogen relationships of soil, and recognised that this fixation of\r\nnitrogen in soil was the work of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nWinogradsky followed up his work and isolated from soil a large\r\nanaerobic spore-forming organism, capable of fixing nitrogen, to which\r\nhe gave the name _Clostridium pasteurianum_. In 1901 the investigations\r\nof Beyerinck, in Holland, led to the important discovery of a group of\r\nlarge aerobic organisms, which he named _Azotobacter_. These were found\r\nto be very active in fixing free nitrogen. More recently, a number of\r\nother nitrogen-fixing bacteria have been described, and the property\r\nhas been found to exist to a small extent in several previously\r\nwell-known organisms.\r\n\r\nIt becomes important to determine which are the groups of bacteria\r\nwhose nitrogen-fixing powers are of chief importance in the soil.\r\n\r\nOn account of its energetic fixation of nitrogen in culture media,\r\n_Azotobacter_ has attracted the greatest attention of workers. The\r\nevidence seems to be consistent with the view that _Azotobacter_ is of\r\nimportance in the soil. Thus the distribution of _Azotobacter_ would\r\nappear to be world-wide. It is found all over Western Europe and the\r\nUnited States. Lipman and Burgess[45] found it in soils collected from\r\nItaly and Spain, Smyrna, Cairo, the Fayum, the Deccan in India, Tahiti,\r\nHawaii, Mexico, Guatemala, and Canada. C. M. Hutchinson[29] found it\r\nto be distributed throughout India. It was found by Omelianski[55]\r\nto be widely distributed in European and Asiatic Russia, and by\r\nGroenewege[28] in Java. Ashby[1] at Rothamsted, isolated it from soils\r\nfrom the Transvaal, East Africa, and Egypt. Also, an association has\r\nsometimes been found between the ability of a soil to fix nitrogen and\r\nthe occurrence and vigour of its _Azotobacter_ flora. Thus Lipman and\r\nWaynick[46] found that if soil from Kansas were removed to California,\r\nits power to produce a growth of _Azotobacter_, when inoculated into a\r\nsuitable medium, was lost, and, at the same time, its nitrogen-fixing\r\npower was greatly reduced. Moreover, it is known that conditions\r\nfavourable to the fixation of nitrogen by _Azotobacter_ in cultures on\r\nthe whole favour nitrogen fixation in soils. The conditions that favour\r\nother aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria are, however, not sufficiently\r\ndistinct to make such evidence of great value.\r\n\r\nIt is usually found that nitrogen fixation is most active in\r\nwell-aerated soil. Thus Ashby,[1] at Rothamsted, found the\r\nnitrogen-fixing power of a soil to decrease rapidly with depth. Similar\r\nresults were obtained in Utah by Greaves. This suggests, at first\r\nsight, that anaerobic nitrogen fixers are unimportant under normal\r\nsoil conditions. It is, however, quite possible that they may assume\r\nan importance when acting in conjunction with aerobic organisms.\r\nThus Omelianski and Salunskov[55] found that beneficial association,\r\nor symbiosis, could occur between _Azotobacter_ and _Clostridium\r\npasteurianum_, the former absorbing oxygen from the surroundings, and\r\nthus creating a suitable anaerobic environment for the _Clostridium_.\r\n\r\nThe question of symbiosis of nitrogen-fixing bacteria with each other\r\nand with other organisms offers an inviting field for research.\r\nThere is evidence that this factor may have considerable importance.\r\nBeijerinck and Van Delden[3] early recognised that _Azotobacter_\r\nin mixed cultures fixed more nitrogen than in pure cultures.\r\n_Granulobacter_, an organism which they found to be commonly associated\r\nwith _Azotobacter_ in crude cultures, appears to increase its\r\nnitrogen-fixing powers (Krzeminiewski).[41] It was also found by\r\nHanzawa[31] that a greater fixation of nitrogen was obtained when two\r\nstrains of _Azotobacter_ were grown together. A symbiosis between\r\n_Azotobacter_ and green algæ has been described, and will be further\r\ndiscussed by Dr. Bristol. It is likely that this association may be of\r\nimportance under suitable conditions on the soil surface where the algæ\r\nare exposed to light.\r\n\r\nThe combination of elemental nitrogen is an endothermic process which\r\nrequires a very considerable amount of energy for its accomplishment.\r\nThis fact is well illustrated by the various commercial processes\r\nin use for fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. The nitrogen-fixing\r\nbacteria obtain this energy from the carbon compounds in the soil.\r\nA number of compounds were compared as sources of energy by Löhnis\r\nand Pillai,[47] who tested their effect on the amounts of nitrogen\r\nfixed by _Azotobacter_ in culture. It was found that mannitol and the\r\nsimpler sugars give the best results as sources of energy, but that\r\nother organic compounds can also be used. Mockeridge[51] has adduced\r\nevidence that ethylene glycol, methyl-, ethyl-, and propyl-alcohol,\r\nlactic, malic, succinic, and glycocollic acids could also be utilised.\r\nSince so large a part of the organic matter added to soil is in the\r\nform of celluloses, it is of great importance to ascertain how far\r\nthese compounds and their decomposition products can be utilised in\r\nnitrogen fixation. Stubble, corn-stalks and roots, oak leaves, lupine\r\nand lucerne tops, maple leaves, and pine needles may all serve as\r\nuseful sources of energy to nitrogen-fixing organisms in the soil. Pure\r\ncellulose cannot apparently be used as a source of energy, but when\r\nacted upon by cellulose decomposing organisms, it becomes available as\r\na source of energy. Hutchinson and Clayton, at Rothamsted, found that\r\na fixation of nitrogen could be brought about by mixed cultures of\r\n_Azotobacter_, and of the cellulose attacking _Spirochæta cytophaga_,\r\nwhen grown in cultures containing pure cellulose. It is not known\r\nhow far cellulose decomposition must proceed to produce an effective\r\nsource of energy, nor what are the substances thus produced that are\r\nutilised. This point will not be decided until something more is known\r\nof the course of changes in the breaking-down of cellulose in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe amount of nitrogen fixed per unit of energy material decomposed\r\nvaries greatly, according to the organism and the conditions.\r\nWinogradsky found that his _Clostridium_ assimilated 2-3 mgs. of\r\nnitrogen per gram of sugar consumed. Lipman found that _Azotobacter_\r\nfixed 15-20 mgs. of nitrogen per gram of mannite consumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\n  Caption: Azotobacter. Decrease in efficiency in N fixation with age\r\n  of culture. (Koch & Seydel.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis: Days.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Milligrams of Nitrogen fixed per gram of dextrose consumed.]\r\n\r\nIt is found, however, that in liquid culture, the ratio of nitrogen\r\nfixed to carbohydrates oxidised varies according to the age of the\r\nculture, falling off rapidly as the age increases[42] (Fig. 5). This\r\ndecreasing efficiency in cultures may be due to the accumulation of\r\nmetabolic products such as would not occur under soil conditions.\r\nIndeed, the efficiency of _Azotobacter_ in a sand culture has been\r\nfound by Krainskii[39] to be considerably greater than in solution. It\r\nis thus probable that in soil the nitrogen-fixing organisms are less\r\nwasteful of energy material than under the usual laboratory conditions.\r\nIt is to be hoped that future research will indicate what are the\r\nconditions that produce the greatest economy of energy material in\r\nnitrogen fixation.\r\n\r\nThe fixation of nitrogen in soil is depressed by the presence of\r\nconsiderable amounts of nitrates. This is, in all probability, due\r\nto the fact that nitrogen-fixing organisms are able to utilise\r\ncompounds of nitrogen where these are available. The energy needed\r\nto build up amino-acids and proteins from nitrate or ammonia is, of\r\ncourse, far less than that required to build up these substances\r\nfrom elemental nitrogen. It is, therefore, not surprising that where\r\nnitrate is available, _Azotobacter_ will use it in preference to fixing\r\natmospheric nitrogen.[5]\r\n\r\nTABLE III.--ASSIMILATION OF NITRATES.\r\n\r\nBY AZOTOBACTER IN PURE CULTURE--(_Bonazzi_).\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+--------+-----------+------+\r\n  |                           | Nitrate|  Organic  |Total |\r\n  |                           |  and   |  Nitrogen |Fixed |\r\n  |                           | Nitrite|and Ammonia| or   |\r\n  |                           |Present.|  Present. |Lost. |\r\n  +---------------------------+--------+-----------+------+\r\n  |                           |  mgs.  |    mgs.   | mgs. |\r\n  |_Culture with nitrate_--   |        |           |      |\r\n  |   At beginning            |  8·55  |    0·76   |  --  |\r\n  |   After growth            |  0·2   |    8·71   | -0·4 |\r\n  |_Culture without nitrate_--|        |           |      |\r\n  |   At beginning            |   --   |    0·76   |  --  |\r\n  |   After growth            |   --   |    4·50   | +3.74|\r\n  +---------------------------+--------+-----------+------+\r\n\r\n  (Growth period--24 days at 25° C.)\r\n\r\nThe chemical process by which nitrogen is fixed is quite unknown,\r\nalthough a number of speculative suggestions have been made. The\r\nappearance of considerable amounts of amino acids in young cultures of\r\n_Azotobacter_ suggests that these may be a step in the process, but at\r\npresent the data are too inconclusive to form a basis for theorising.\r\n\r\n_Azotobacter_ is very rich in phosphorus, an analysis of the surface\r\ngrowth in _Azotobacter_ cultures, made by Stoklasa, giving about 60\r\nper cent. of phosphoric acid in the ash. In cultures it has been found\r\nthat a considerable amount of phosphate is needed to produce full\r\ndevelopment. As would be expected, therefore, nitrogen fixation in soil\r\nis often greatly stimulated by the addition of phosphates. Christensen\r\nhas, indeed, found soils where lack of phosphate was the limiting\r\nfactor for _Azotobacter_ growth.\r\n\r\n_Azotobacter_ is very intolerant of an acid medium, and is very\r\ndependent on the presence of an available base. In cultures this\r\nis usually provided in the form of calcium or magnesium carbonate.\r\nGainey[21] found that _Azotobacter_ occurred in soils having an acidity\r\nnot greater than P_{H} 6·0, and Christensen,[7],[9] in Denmark, has\r\nfound a close association between the occurrence of _Azotobacter_ in\r\nsoils and the presence of an adequate supply of calcium carbonate. So\r\nclose was this association that he devised a technique based on this\r\nfact for detecting a deficiency of lime in a soil sample.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the groups already discussed, there is a remarkable and\r\nimportant group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit and can carry\r\non their functions within the root tissues of higher plants. It has\r\nbeen known at least from classical times that certain leguminous plants\r\nwould, under suitable conditions, render the soil more productive. On\r\nthe roots of leguminosæ small tubercles are commonly found. These were\r\nnoted and figured by Malpighi in the seventeenth century, and for a\r\nlong time were regarded as root-galls. As was described in Chapter I.,\r\nthe true nature of these tubercles was finally elucidated by Hellriegel\r\nand Wilfarth in 1886. As the result of a series of pot experiments,\r\nthey made the very brilliant deduction that the ability to fix\r\nnitrogen, possessed by the legumes, was due to bacteria associated with\r\nthem in the tubercles.\r\n\r\nThese bacteria were finally isolated and studied in pure culture\r\nby Beijerinck. Since then a very great deal of literature has\r\naccumulated on the subject of the nodule-producing bacteria, which\r\nit is impossible to deal with in a small space. The nodule organism,\r\n_Bacillus radicicola_, when grown on suitable media, passes through a\r\nnumber of different changes in morphology. The most connected account\r\nof these changes is given in a paper by Bewley and Hutchinson.[4]\r\nIn a vigorous culture the commonest type is a rod-shaped bacillus\r\nwhich may or may not be motile. As these get older they often become\r\nbranched, or irregular in shape, the formation of these branched forms\r\nbeing perhaps due to conditions in the medium. These irregular forms,\r\nknown as “bacteroids,” are a characteristic type in the nodules. Their\r\nproduction in culture media has been found to be stimulated by sugars\r\nand organic acids such as would occur in their environment within the\r\nhost plant. In the older rods and bacteroids the staining material\r\nbecomes condensed into granules, and finally the rods disintegrate or\r\nbreak up into coccoid forms. By suitable culture conditions, Bewley and\r\nHutchinson obtained cultures consisting almost entirely of this stage.\r\nIf such a culture be inoculated into a fresh medium rich in sugar,\r\nthe swarmer stage appears in great numbers. These swarmers are very\r\nminute coccoid rods, ·9 × ·18 in size, that are actively motile. They\r\napparently develop later into the rod stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--_Bacillus radicicola._ Stages in the life\r\ncycle. (After HUTCHINSON and BEWLEY.)\r\n\r\n  Motile Rods\r\n\r\n  Vacuolated Stage\r\n\r\n  “Swarmers”\r\n\r\n  “Bacteroids”\r\n\r\n  “Pre-swarmers”]\r\n\r\nVery little is known as to the life of the organism in the soil.\r\nIt is able, however, to fix nitrogen in cultures, and it has been\r\nclaimed[35],[48] that it can do so in the soil outside the plant, so\r\nthat it is possible that we must take it into consideration in this\r\nconnection. More knowledge is needed as to the optimum conditions for\r\nthe growth of the organism in the soil. It seems to be more tolerant of\r\nacid soil conditions than _Azotobacter_. The limiting degree of acidity\r\nhas been found to vary among different varieties of the organism from\r\nP_{H} 3·15 to P_{H} 4·9.\r\n\r\nA long controversy has been held as to whether the nodule organisms\r\nfound in different host-plants all belong to one species, or whether\r\nthere are a number of separate species, each capable of infecting a\r\nsmall group of host-plants. As the term “species” has at present no\r\nexact meaning when applied to bacteria, the discussion in this form\r\nis unlikely to reach a conclusion. The evidence seems to show that\r\nthe nodule organisms form a group that is in a state of divergent\r\nspecialisation to life in different host-plants, and that this\r\nspecialisation has reached different degrees with different hosts.\r\nThus the organisms from the nodule of the pea (_Pisum sativum_) will\r\nalso produce nodules on vicia, Lathyrus, and Lens, but seem to have\r\nlost the ability normally to infect other legumes. On the other hand,\r\nthe bacteria from the nodules of the Soy Bean (_Glycine hispida_)\r\nhave become so specialised that they do not infect any other genus\r\nof host-plant, and soy beans are resistant to infection by other\r\nvarieties of the nodule organism. Burrill and Hansen,[6] after an\r\nextensive study, divided the nodule bacteria into eleven groups, within\r\neach of which the host-plants are interchangeable. The existence of\r\ndifferent groups of nodule organisms has been confirmed by the separate\r\nevidence of serological tests (Zipfel, Klimmer, and Kruger).[40] The\r\nresults of cross-inoculation tests have sometimes been conflicting. It\r\nseems, indeed, that the host-plant has a variable power of resisting\r\ninfection, so that when its resistance is lowered it may be capable of\r\ninfection by a strange variety of the nodule organism. The question\r\nthat has thus arisen of the ability of the legume to resist infection\r\nis of fundamental importance, and its elucidation should throw light on\r\nthe relation of plants to bacterial infection as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe stage of the organism that infects the plant is not at present\r\nknown. It may be supposed that it is the motile “swarmer.” The entry is\r\nnormally effected through the root-hairs. The hair is attacked close\r\nto the tip, and an enzyme is apparently produced which causes the tip\r\nto bend over in a characteristic manner. The organisms multiply within\r\nthe root hair and pass down it, producing a characteristic gelatinous\r\nthread filled with bacteria, in the rod form. This “infection thread”\r\npasses down into the cells of the root tissue, where it branches\r\nprofusely. In young stages of nodule formation the branches can be seen\r\npenetrating cells in the pericycle layer. Rapid cell division of these\r\nroot cells is induced. In the course of this cell division abnormal\r\nmitotic figures are sometimes found, such as occur in pathological\r\ngrowths. The cells push outward the root cortical layer, and so form a\r\nnodule.\r\n\r\nCertain of the cells in the centre of the nodule become greatly\r\nenlarged, and in the fully grown nodule are seen to be filled with\r\nbacteria. Differences have been described in the morphology of the\r\norganisms in different parts of the nodule.[62] Whether the different\r\nstages of the organism are equally capable of fixing nitrogen, or what\r\nis the significance of these stages within the nodule, is not certainly\r\nknown. It has been held that it is the irregular bacteroid forms that\r\nare chiefly concerned with nitrogen fixation. In older nodules the\r\norganisms become irregular and stain faintly, and the bacteroidal\r\ntissue breaks down, the nodule finally decaying. In the fixation of\r\nnitrogen that occurs in the nodules, the bacteria without doubt derive\r\nthe necessary energy from the carbohydrates of the host-plant. There\r\nis evidence that the plant assists the process of fixation by removing\r\nsoluble metabolic products from the neighbourhood of the bacteria.\r\nGolding[22] was able to obtain a greatly increased fixation of nitrogen\r\nin artificial cultures by arranging a filtering device so as to remove\r\nthe products of metabolism.\r\n\r\nThe great practical importance of leguminous crops in agriculture has\r\nled to numerous attempts being made to increase their growth, and the\r\nfixation of nitrogen in them, by inoculating the seed or the soil with\r\nsuitable nodule-bacteria. This inoculation can be effected either with\r\nsoil in which the host-plant has been successfully grown, and which\r\nshould consequently contain the organism in fair numbers, or else pure\r\ncultures of the organisms isolated from nodules may be used. Very\r\nvarying results have been obtained with inoculation trials.\r\n\r\nIn farm practice a leguminous crop has often been introduced into a\r\nnew area where it has never previously grown. In such soil it is very\r\nprobable that varieties of the nodule organism capable of infecting the\r\nroots may not exist. In such cases inoculation with the right organism\r\nor with infected soil often produces good results.\r\n\r\nThe more difficult case, however, is that in which the legume crop\r\nhas been grown for a long time in the locality, and where the soil\r\nis already infected with right organisms. This, the more fundamental\r\nproblem, applies especially to this country. Here it would seem that\r\ninoculation with a culture of the organism will benefit the plant only\r\n(1) if the naturally occurring organisms are present in very small\r\nnumbers; or (2) if the organisms in the culture added are more virulent\r\nthan those already in the soil. The problem of successful inoculation\r\nwould therefore seem to be bound up with that of grading up the\r\ninfective virulence of the organism to a higher level.\r\n\r\nSuccessful nodule development in a legume crop is also dependent to a\r\nlarge degree on the soil conditions. The effects of soil conditions on\r\nnodule development have been studied by numerous workers. Moisture has\r\nbeen found very greatly to affect the nodule development. Certain salts\r\nhave a very definite effect on nodule formation.[64] Their effect on\r\nthe number of nodules developing has been studied, but the reason for\r\nthis effect is unusually difficult to decide. The action is usually a\r\ncomplex one. Thus phosphates are known to stimulate nodule formation.\r\nThey probably act in several ways. In the first place, they may cause\r\nthe nodule organisms to multiply in the soil; in the second place, they\r\nproduce a greater root development in the plant, thus increasing the\r\nchances of infection; and in the third place, Bewley and Hutchinson[4]\r\nhave found that phosphates cause the appearance of the motile stage\r\nof the organism in cultures. A real understanding of the influence of\r\nenvironment on nodule production will produce great improvements in our\r\nmethods of legume cropping.\r\n\r\n\r\n_D._ THE RELATION OF BACTERIAL ACTIVITIES TO SOIL FERTILITY.\r\n\r\nThe various activities of the soil bacteria have a vital importance to\r\nthe growth of higher plants, which are dependent for their existence\r\non certain of these processes. In the first place, as we have seen,\r\nbacteria decompose the tissues of higher plants and produce humus\r\nmaterials, which are essential to the maintenance of good physical\r\nproperties in the soil. Then the nitrate supply on which most higher\r\nplants depend is produced by the decomposition of organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds by bacteria in their search for energy. The depletion of the\r\ntotal nitrogen content of the soil through rain and through the removal\r\nof nitrogen in the crops, is to some extent compensated by the fixation\r\nof atmospheric nitrogen by certain bacteria. On the other hand, in the\r\nassimilation of nitrogen compounds to build up protein, the bacteria\r\nare competing with higher plants for one of their essential food\r\nconstituents, and their action may, under certain conditions, cause a\r\ntemporary nitrogen starvation. One must remember, however, that large\r\nquantities of nitrate are lost from field soils by washing-out through\r\nrain action, especially in winter. The assimilation of nitrate and\r\nammonia by micro-organisms keeps some of this nitrogen in the soil, and\r\nat certain periods may thus be beneficial.\r\n\r\nThere is another important respect in which soil bacteria influence\r\nplant growth. Their activities result in the release of inorganic\r\nsalts, such as potash and phosphates, in a form available for the use\r\nof plants. The release of phosphorus and potassium compounds takes\r\nplace in two ways. In the first place, organic matter containing\r\nphosphorus and potassium, in an insoluble form, is attacked by\r\nbacteria, resulting in these elements being set free as inorganic\r\nsalts available to the higher plant. Secondly, much of the phosphorus\r\nsupplied to the soil from rock minerals is present as insoluble\r\nphosphates, such as apatite and iron phosphate. Much of the potassium,\r\ntoo, is derived from insoluble silicate minerals. In both cases the\r\nconversion of the insoluble minerals into soluble phosphates and\r\npotassium compounds is brought about to a large extent by solution in\r\nwater containing carbonic and other acids. These acids are largely\r\nproduced by micro-organisms, which, in addition to carbonic acid,\r\nproduce organic acids, and in specialised cases, sulphuric and nitrous\r\nacids. It has been found, for example, that in a compost of soil\r\nwith sulphur and insoluble phosphate, sufficient sulphuric acid may\r\nbe produced by the oxidation of the sulphur by bacteria to convert\r\nan appreciable amount of phosphate into a soluble form. When we\r\nconsider the functions performed by soil bacteria, therefore, it is\r\nnot surprising to find that high bacterial activity in the soil is\r\nassociated, as a rule, with fertility.\r\n\r\n\r\n_E._ CHANGES IN BACTERIAL NUMBERS AND ACTIVITIES, AND THEIR RELATION TO\r\nEXTERNAL FACTORS.\r\n\r\nThe object of soil bacteriologists is to discover means of favouring\r\nthe activity of soil bacteria, especially those activities that are\r\nuseful to the higher plant. Knowledge is therefore needed of the\r\nchanges in numbers and activities of the soil bacteria, and of the\r\ninfluence of soil conditions on them. The necessity of studying these\r\nchanges has required the development of a quantitative technique by\r\nwhich the numbers of bacteria in the soil and their activities can be\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThe method commonly used in counting bacteria in soil is a modification\r\nof the plating method of Koch. In counting bacteria two difficulties\r\nhave to be overcome--their immense numbers and their small size. The\r\nnumbers of bacteria in soil are so large that the bacterial population\r\nof a gram of soil could not, of course, be counted directly. The method\r\nadopted, therefore, is to make a suspension of soil in sterile salt\r\nsolution, and to dilute this suspension to a convenient and known\r\nextent, which will depend on the numbers of bacteria expected. In\r\nordinary field soils it is found convenient, for example, to dilute the\r\nsoil suspension so that one cubic centimeter of the diluted suspension\r\nwill contain 1/250,000th of a gram of soil. Such a volume will commonly\r\ncontain a number of bacteria sufficiently small to count. The second\r\ndifficulty is that the organisms are microscopic, and yet cannot be\r\nreadily counted under the microscope owing to the presence of soil\r\nparticles in the suspension. Hence recourse is had to plating. One\r\ncubic centimeter of diluted suspension is placed in a petri dish and\r\nmixed with a suitable nutrient agar medium, melted, and cooled to about\r\n40° C. The medium sets, and after a few days’ incubation the organisms\r\nmultiply and produce colonies visible to the naked eye. By counting\r\nthese colonies we obtain an estimate of the number of bacteria in\r\nthe one cubic centimeter of suspension, it being assumed that every\r\norganism has developed into one colony, and by multiplying this number\r\nby the degree of dilution we obtain the numbers per gram of soil.\r\nIn practice a number of parallel platings are made from one cubic\r\ncentimeter portions of the diluted suspension and the mean number of\r\ncolonies per plate is taken. By this means the error due to the random\r\ndistribution of bacteria in the suspension is reduced, because of the\r\ngreater number of organisms counted.\r\n\r\nIn drawing conclusions from bacterial count data, it is necessary to\r\ndistinguish between the indication which the method gives of the\r\nabsolute numbers of bacteria in the soil and the accuracy with which\r\nit enables the numbers of two soil samples to be compared. The method\r\ncannot be used for the former purpose at present. We do not know how\r\nfar the figures obtained by this counting method fall short of the\r\nactual number of bacteria in the soil. One reason for this is the\r\ndifficulty of effecting a complete separation of the clumps of bacteria\r\ninto discrete individuals in the suspension. Then again, there is no\r\nknown medium upon which all the physiological groups of bacteria will\r\ndevelop and produce colonies. And even on a suitable medium some of the\r\nindividuals may fail to multiply.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the bacterial numbers in two soil samples, however,\r\nthe case is different. Within each bacterial group investigated the\r\nplate method should give counts proportional to the bacterial numbers\r\nin the soil. Thus, by the method one should be able to tell whether\r\nthe bacterial numbers are increasing or decreasing over a period of\r\ntime, or whether a certain soil treatment produces an increase or\r\na decrease. With this end in view the technique of the method has\r\nbeen improved by recent workers. It was found that, when carefully\r\nstandardised, the process of dilution of the soil could be carried\r\nout without significant variation in result (Table IV.), and that the\r\naccuracy of the method is limited mainly by the variation in colony\r\nnumbers on parallel platings, due in part to random distribution of\r\nbacteria throughout the final suspension, and partly to the uneven\r\ndevelopment of colonies on the medium. The question of the medium was\r\ntherefore taken up with a view to improving the uniformity of results\r\nobtained with it. Lipman, Conn, and others effected an improvement by\r\nusing chemical compounds as nutrient ingredients, thus making their\r\nmedia more closely reproducible. On most agar media, an important\r\ndisturbing factor is the growth of spreading colonies, which prevent\r\nthe development of some of the other colonies. A medium has been\r\ndevised at Rothamsted on which these spreading organisms are largely\r\nrestricted.[61] A statistical examination[19] has shown that on this\r\nmedium errors due to the uneven development of colonies, except in\r\nspecial cases, are prevented, so that in fact the variation in colony\r\nnumbers between parallel plates is found to be that produced merely by\r\nrandom distribution of bacteria in the diluted suspension (see Table\r\nIV.). In this case the accuracy of the counts of the bacteria in the\r\ndiluted suspension depend directly on the number of colonies counted,\r\nand can be known with precision.\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.--BACTERIAL COUNTS OF A SOIL SAMPLE.\r\n\r\nPARALLEL PLATE COUNTS FROM FOUR SETS OF DILUTIONS MADE BY DIFFERENT\r\nWORKERS.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------+\r\n  |   Counts of Colonies on each Plate.      |\r\n  +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |Plate.| Set I. | Set II.|Set III.| Set IV.|\r\n  +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |   1  |  72    |  74    |  78    |  69    |\r\n  |   2  |  69    |  72    |  74    |  67    |\r\n  |   3  |  63    |  70    |  70    |  66    |\r\n  |   4  |  59    |  69    |  58    |  64    |\r\n  |   5  |  59    |  66    |  58    |  62    |\r\n  |   6  |  53    |  58    |  56    |  58    |\r\n  |   7  |  51    |  52    |  56    |  54    |\r\n  +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  | Mean |  60·86 |  65·86 |  64·28 |  62·86 |\r\n  +------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  Standard deviation between the four sets = 5·62.\r\n\r\n  Standard deviation between plates within the sets = 7·76.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge obtained from counts of soil bacteria is subject to\r\nanother serious limitation. We do not know which of the bacteria\r\ncounted are the most effective in bringing about the various changes\r\nthat take place in the soil. It is not even known which of them are\r\nactive in the soil and which are in a resting condition. It is thus\r\npossible to have two soils containing equal numbers of bacteria but\r\nshowing widely different biochemical activity, if one soil contains\r\norganisms of a higher efficiency. Moreover, as has been pointed\r\nout, many important groups of soil bacteria do not develop on the\r\nplating media, and so are not counted. These considerations led to\r\nthe development of supplementary methods by which it was hoped to\r\nestimate the actual biochemical activity of the soil microflora. The\r\nfirst of these methods was developed by Remy, who attempted to study\r\nthe biochemical activity of a soil by placing weighed amounts into\r\nsterile solutions of suitable and known composition, keeping them\r\nunder standard conditions for a definite time and then estimating the\r\namount of the chemical change that was being studied. Thus, to test the\r\nactivity of the organisms that produce ammonia from organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds, he inoculated soil into 1 per cent. peptone solution and\r\nmeasured the amount of ammonia produced in a given time. By similar\r\nmethods the power of a soil to oxidise ammonia to nitrate, to reduce\r\nnitrate, or to fix atmospheric nitrogen, is tested. This method has\r\nbeen extensively used and developed by more recent workers. It suffers,\r\nhowever, from the same serious disadvantage that it was designed to\r\navoid, for we cannot be certain that those bacteria that develop in\r\nthe nutrient solution are the types that are active in the soil, and,\r\nmoreover, even where the same types do function in the two conditions,\r\nwe do not know that the degree of their activity is the same in soil\r\nand in solution cultures. For instance, _Nitrosomonas_ appears to show\r\nvery different degrees of activity in soil and in culture.\r\n\r\nAnother method, therefore, of studying the activity of soil\r\nmicro-organisms is the obvious one of estimating the chemical changes\r\nthat they produce in the soil itself. This method has obvious\r\nadvantages over the unnatural methods developed from Remy’s, but it has\r\na number of limitations that make its actual application difficult.\r\nIn the first place, we cannot always tell whether changes found to\r\noccur in soil are due to the activity of micro-organisms, or are\r\npurely chemical reactions unassisted by biological agencies. Then, if\r\nwe succeed in showing that the changes are due to micro-organisms, it\r\nis very difficult to determine which organisms are effecting them.\r\nThis cannot be definitely tested by isolating suspected organisms and\r\ntesting their activity in sterile soil, because in sterilising soil its\r\nnature and composition is altered. In spite of these difficulties,\r\nhowever, the study of the chemical changes that take place in the soil\r\nhas produced valuable knowledge, when it has been combined with a\r\nstudy of the changes in the number and variety of the micro-organisms\r\nthat accompany these reactions. This method of investigation is well\r\nillustrated by the work of Russell and Hutchinson on the effects of\r\nheat and volatile antiseptics on soil, where a study of the chemical\r\nchanges such as ammonia production, that occurred in these treated\r\nsoils, combined with a study of the changes in bacterial numbers, led\r\nto the realisation that the soil micro-population was a complex one,\r\ncontaining active protozoa.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty in applying quantitative methods to bacteria in the\r\nfield is the great variation in the density of the bacterial population\r\nover a plot of field soil, which may be so great that a bacterial count\r\nfrom a single sample is quite valueless. For example, the distribution\r\nof bacterial numbers over a plot of arable soil near Northampton was\r\nstudied by taking sixteen samples distributed over an area about\r\n12 feet square. The result showed that in some cases the bacterial\r\nnumbers in samples taken 6 inches apart differed by nearly 100 per\r\ncent. Fortunately, under favourable conditions, a remarkably uniform\r\ndistribution of bacterial numbers over a plot of soil can be found.\r\n\r\nOn such a plot it is possible to investigate the rapidity with which\r\nthe numbers of the soil micro-organisms alter in point of time. For\r\nexample, on the dunged plot of Barnfield, Rothamsted, which has been\r\ncropped with mangolds for forty-seven successive years, the area\r\ndistribution of bacteria has been found to be so uniform that if a\r\nnumber of samples of soil are taken from the plot at the same time, the\r\ndifference in bacterial numbers between the samples cannot be detected\r\nby means of the counting technique (see Table V.). The work of Cutler,\r\nCrump, and Sandon[16] on this plot showed that the bacterial numbers\r\nvary very greatly from one day to the next, and that these fluctuations\r\ntook place over the whole plot, since two series of samples, taken in\r\ntwo rows 6 feet apart, showed similar fluctuations (see Fig. 7). The\r\ndiscovery of these big daily fluctuations in numbers led to an inquiry\r\nas to how quickly bacterial numbers change, and samples from Barnfield,\r\ntaken at two-hourly intervals, showed that significant changes in\r\nnumbers took place even at such short intervals.\r\n\r\nTABLE V.--BACTERIAL COUNTS OF FOUR SOIL SAMPLES.\r\n\r\nFROM BARNFIELD, TAKEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |          Counts of Colonies on each Plate.           |\r\n  +------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |Plate.| Sample I. | Sample II.|Sample III.| Sample IV.|\r\n  +------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |  1   |    38     |    45     |    43     |    27     |\r\n  |  2   |    32     |    40     |    34     |    41     |\r\n  |  3   |    52     |    45     |    52     |    35     |\r\n  |  4   |    32     |    31     |    55     |    36     |\r\n  |  5   |    40     |    43     |    38     |    45     |\r\n  |Mean  |    38·8   |    40·8   |    44·4   |    36·8   |\r\n  +------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  Standard deviation between the four samples = 7·25.\r\n\r\n  Standard deviation between parallel plates within the sets = 7·55.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\n  X-axis (top): Days.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis (left): (Series A) Bacteria--millions per gramme of soil.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis (right): (Series B) Bacteria--millions per gramme.\r\n\r\n  Caption: Daily changes in bacterial numbers in field soil.\r\n\r\n  Counts from two series of soil samples taken 6 feet apart.\r\n\r\n  (After Cutler.)]\r\n\r\nSince the bacteria involved in this fluctuation are of great importance\r\nto the crops, being for the most part ammonia producing types, further\r\nknowledge as to the cause of this fluctuation and of its effect on the\r\nammonia and nitrate in the soil is of fundamental importance. There is\r\nevidence, which will be discussed later, that the cause is connected\r\nwith the changing activities of certain soil protozoa, since the daily\r\nchanges in the numbers of active amœbæ in the soil have been found\r\nto be in the reverse direction to those of the bacterial numbers. It\r\nappears, therefore, that we are dealing with an equilibrium between\r\nthe various members of the soil population, the point of equilibrium\r\nchanging at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to daily changes, it is possible to detect changes in the\r\nnumbers and activity of the soil population related to the season.\r\nThere is a well-marked increase in the spring and autumn (see Figs.\r\n15, 16, pp. 89, 90). This is well seen when the fortnightly averages\r\nof the daily bacterial and protozoal counts from Barnfield soil\r\nare plotted. These spring and autumn increases comprise both the\r\nbacterial and the protozoal population, and therefore differ from the\r\nshort time fluctuations in being due, not to a disturbance of the\r\nbacteria-protozoa equilibrium, but to a general rise in activity of\r\nboth groups of organisms.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the action of external conditions on the soil\r\nbacteria, the existence of a complex soil population and the\r\ninterdependence of its members must be borne in mind. Changes in\r\nexternal conditions may affect the different components of the\r\npopulation in different ways or to different degrees, thus upsetting\r\nthe equilibrium between the various groups. For example, the addition\r\nof a mild aromatic antiseptic to the soil apparently affects the\r\nprotozoa in such a way as to disturb the bacteria-protozoa equilibrium\r\nin favour of the bacteria, while in some cases the aromatic compound\r\naffords a food supply to special bacteria, causing these to increase,\r\nupsetting the equilibrium between the different bacterial groups. When\r\nour knowledge of the effect of external factors on the soil population\r\nbecomes sufficient, it will probably be found that in nearly all\r\ncases a change in the soil conditions produces some disturbance in\r\nthe equilibrium between the components of the soil population, though\r\nat present there are only certain examples where this disturbance is a\r\nprobable explanation of the facts.\r\n\r\nSince bacteria are dependent on adequate supplies of energy and food,\r\nit is to be expected that additions of organic matter or of inorganic\r\nfood materials will greatly benefit their activities. The effect of\r\nadded farmyard manure in increasing bacterial activities has been much\r\nstudied.[27] Some of the increased bacterial numbers and activities\r\nin this case may be due to the addition of bacteria with the manure,\r\nbut it is thought that this factor is of less importance than the\r\nadded energy and food supply which the general soil flora obtain from\r\nit. Nutritive salts such as phosphates and salts of potassium usually\r\nincrease the bacterial activities.\r\n\r\nThe effect of alkali salts on soil bacteria has been especially studied\r\nin the Western United States, where the existence of alkali in the\r\nsoil is a serious problem.[23] Soil bacteria are usually stimulated by\r\nsmall doses of alkali salts that are toxic in higher concentration.\r\nAs a rule, chlorides are the most toxic salts, the electronegative\r\nion playing an important part in the effect of the salt. Salts\r\naffect bacteria both owing to the changes in osmotic pressure which\r\nthey produce, and through their specific action on the bacterial\r\nprotoplasm.[26] When equal weights of various salts are added to soil,\r\ntheir toxic action on bacteria shows so little association with their\r\nrespective osmotic pressures that we must conclude that this factor is\r\nthe less important. There is reason to suppose that the toxic action\r\nof salts on bacteria is often connected with an effect of the specific\r\nions on the permeability of the bacterial cell-wall. This conclusion\r\nis based on the changes in electrical conductivity of bacterial\r\nsuspensions in the presence of various salts.[59]\r\n\r\nA definite antagonism between various salts has been found to exist.\r\nIt is possible that future work in this line may indicate what are\r\nthe proportions of common electrolytes which will produce a properly\r\n“balanced” soil solution so that the harmful excess of one salt may be\r\nantagonised.\r\n\r\nCertain salts, such as those of arsenic[24] and manganese, seem to\r\nexercise a stimulating action on bacterial activities; the causes of\r\nthis action are not at present understood.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of the soil has an important effect on the bacterial\r\nprocesses. The acidity of soils may increase to such a point that the\r\ndecomposition of plant tissues by bacteria is hindered, a peat layer\r\nbeing thus produced. The degree of acidity that is toxic varies very\r\ngreatly with different soil bacteria, some of them, like Azotobacter\r\nand Nitrosomonas being very intolerant of acidity.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of aeration, water content, and temperature are\r\ninter-related in field soil. Ammonifying organisms are not greatly\r\ndependent on aeration, but this factor is sometimes a limiting one in\r\nthe case of the very aerobic nitrifying bacteria. Hence efficient soil\r\ncultivation is beneficial to nitrification.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to correlate the temperature and moisture\r\nof field soils with the bacterial numbers and activities. These\r\nattempts have given very discordant results. It is generally agreed\r\nthat a plentiful moisture supply is beneficial. Thus Greaves, in Utah,\r\nfound the optimum water content for ammonia and nitrate production\r\nto be about 60 per cent. of the water-holding capacity. On the other\r\nhand, Prescott[56] found that the summer desiccation of soil in\r\nEgypt was followed by increased bacterial activities. Fabricius and\r\nFeilitzen,[18] using moor soil, found a direct relationship between\r\nsoil temperature and bacterial numbers, showing that temperature can\r\nbe a limiting factor under certain conditions. With normal arable\r\nsoils, however, no such direct effect of temperature or moisture can\r\nbe found[16] (see Fig. 8). It has even been found by Conn[11] that\r\nfreezing of the soil may cause a marked increase in bacterial numbers.\r\nThe erratic effects of temperature and moisture on the soil bacteria\r\nprobably afford instances of a disturbance of the equilibrium between\r\nthe bacteria and other components of the soil micro-population. Thus\r\ndesiccation and freezing, though they harmfully affect the bacteria,\r\nmay inhibit other micro-organisms to a greater degree, thus freeing\r\nthe bacteria from competition. It is in the investigation of this\r\nequilibrium, and of the factors that can control it to our benefit,\r\nthat the great advances in soil biology in the future are to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Effect of frost on the bacterial numbers in the\r\nsoil.

Of recent years a great deal of our knowledge of the\r\ncytology of the different groups of protozoa, especially the Amœbæ, has\r\nbeen obtained from the study of representatives normally living in the\r\nsoil; but unfortunately little or no knowledge has been gained of the\r\nbiology of these animals in their natural habitat.\r\n\r\nThe view that the presence of these organisms in excessive numbers may\r\nlead to “soil sickness” was first put forward by Russell and Hutchinson\r\nin 1909, and elaborated in their further papers dealing with “Partial\r\nSterilisation of the Soil.”\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to discuss in detail this important branch of\r\nagriculture, but to obtain a clear idea of the development of\r\nthe study of soil protozoa it is necessary to give as briefly as\r\npossible the conclusions deduced by Russell and Hutchinson from their\r\nextensive experiments on soils treated with steam and various volatile\r\nantiseptics[21],[22]:--\r\n\r\n“(1) Partial sterilisation of the soil causes first a fall, then a\r\nrise, in bacterial numbers, which goes on till the numbers considerably\r\nexceed those present in the original soil.\r\n\r\n“(2) Simultaneously there is a marked increase in the rate of\r\naccumulation of ammonia which is formed from organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n“(3) The increase in bacterial numbers is the result of improvement in\r\nthe soil as a medium for bacterial growth, and not an improvement in\r\nthe bacterial flora.\r\n\r\n“(4) The improvement in the soil brought about by partial sterilisation\r\nis permanent, the high bacterial numbers being kept up even for 200\r\ndays or more. It is evident from (3) and (4) that the factor limiting\r\nbacterial numbers in ordinary soil is not bacterial, nor is it any\r\nproduct of bacterial activity, nor does it arise spontaneously in soils.\r\n\r\n“(5) But if some of the untreated soil is introduced into partially\r\nsterilised soil, the bacterial numbers, after the initial rise, begin\r\nto fall. Thus the limiting factor can be reintroduced from untreated\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n“(6) Evidence of the limiting factor in untreated soils is obtained\r\nby studying the effect of temperature on bacterial numbers. Untreated\r\nsoils were maintained at 10°, 20°, 30° C. in a well-moistened aerated\r\ncondition, and periodical counts were made of the numbers of bacteria\r\nper gram. Rise in temperature rarely caused any increase in bacterial\r\nnumbers. But after the soil was partially sterilised the bacterial\r\nnumbers showed the normal increase with increasing temperatures.\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.\r\n\r\n  +--------+------------------------+------------------------+\r\n  |        |                        |     Soil Treated       |\r\n  |        |     Untreated Soil.    |     with Toluene.      |\r\n  |Tempera-+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | ture of|      |After|After|After|      |After|After|After|\r\n  |Storage.|  At  | 13  | 25  | 70  |  At  | 13  | 25  | 70  |\r\n  |  °C.   |Start.|Days.|Days.|Days.|Start.|Days.|Days.|Days.|\r\n  +--------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | 5°-12° |  65  |  63 |  41 |  32 |  8·5 |  73 | 101 | 137 |\r\n  |  20°   |  65  |  41 |  22 |  23 |  8·5 | 187 | 128 | 182 |\r\n  |  30°   |  65  |  27 |  50 |  16 |  8·5 | 197 | 145 |  51 |\r\n  |  40°   |  65  |  14 |   9 |  33 |  8·5 | 148 |  52 | 100 |\r\n  +--------+------+-----+-----+-----+------+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n“(7) It is evident, therefore, that the limiting factor in the\r\nuntreated soils is not the lack of anything, but the presence of\r\nsomething active. The properties of the limiting factor are:--\r\n\r\n  “(_a_) It is active and not a lack of something.\r\n\r\n  “(_b_) It is not bacterial.\r\n\r\n  “(_c_) It is extinguished by heat or poisons.\r\n\r\n  “(_d_) It can be re-introduced into soils from which it has been\r\n  extinguished by the addition of a little untreated soil.\r\n\r\n  “(_e_) It develops more slowly than bacteria.\r\n\r\n  “(_f_) It is favoured by conditions favourable to trophic life in the\r\n  soil, and finally becomes so active that the bacteria become unduly\r\n  depressed.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to see what agent other than a living organism can\r\nfulfil these conditions. Search was therefore made for a larger\r\norganism capable of destroying bacteria, and considerable numbers of\r\nprotozoa were found. The ciliates and amœbæ are killed by partial\r\nsterilisation. Whenever they are killed the detrimental factor is found\r\nto be put out of action; the bacterial numbers rise and maintain a high\r\nlevel. Whenever the detrimental factor is not put out of action, the\r\nprotozoa are not killed. To these rules we have found no exception.”\r\n\r\nFrom such premises as the above Russell and Hutchinson founded the\r\n“protozoa theory of partial sterilisation,” and at Rothamsted there was\r\ncommenced the serious study of these soil organisms.\r\n\r\nGoodey was one of the early workers on this new subject, and added\r\nconsiderably to our knowledge of the species living in normal soils,\r\nand of the chemical constitution of the cyst wall of ciliates. He\r\nalso made investigations on the effects of various chemicals on the\r\nmicro-population of soils, but was unable to draw very definite\r\nconclusions.[11]\r\n\r\nOne of the first criticisms raised against the protozoa theory of\r\npartial sterilisation was that the protozoa were not normal inhabitants\r\nof the soil, and were present only in small numbers, all of them in the\r\ncystic, quiescent condition. It was further held that these cysts were\r\ncarried by the wind from dried-up ponds and streams. It is difficult to\r\ntrace the origin of this view, since early observers, viz., Ehrenberg\r\nand Dujardin, in 1841, were of the opinion that the protozoa were\r\nliving in the trophic active condition in the soil, and it was not\r\nuntil 1878 that Stein showed that free living protozoa can encyst. To\r\nMartin and Lewin, however, must be ascribed the distinction of first\r\nproving that the soil possesses an active protozoan population, for\r\nby a series of ingenious experiments these observers isolated several\r\nflagellates and amœbæ in a trophic condition from certain of the\r\nRothamsted soils.[18] The more recent work in this country has been\r\nin the direction of devising new quantitative methods of research,\r\nsince by this means alone is it possible to elucidate many fundamental\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nIn America and elsewhere experiments have been devised for testing the\r\nconclusions of Russell and Hutchinson. Cunningham and Löhnis,[2] in\r\nAmerica, Truffaut and Bezssonoff,[24] in France, supply evidence in\r\nfavour of the theory, but most of the American work is in opposition to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSherman[23] is perhaps the most prominent in opposing the phagocytic\r\naction of protozoa on soil bacteria in spite of the fact that certain\r\nof his experimental results apparently show enormous decreases in\r\nbacterial numbers in the presence of protozoa. In many of his soil\r\ninoculation experiments, however, it was not demonstrated that his\r\nactive cultures remained alive after entering the soil.\r\n\r\nThe experimental difficulties of dealing with soil protozoa are\r\nconsiderable, and without a thoroughly sound technique investigators\r\nmay easily go astray.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom is divided into two main groups or sub-kingdoms--the\r\nProtozoa and the Metozoa. In the latter the characteristic feature\r\nis that the body is composed of several units, called cells, and\r\nconsequently such animals are often spoken of as multicellular. The\r\nProtozoa, on the other hand, are usually designated as uni-cellular,\r\nsince their bodies are regarded as being homologous to a single unit or\r\ncell of the metozoan body. For various reasons exception has been taken\r\nby Dobell[9] and others to the use of the term uni-cellular, for, as\r\nDobell says, “If we regard the whole organism as an individual unit,\r\nthen the whole protozoan is strictly comparable with a whole metozoon,\r\nand not with a part of it. But the body of a protozoan, though it shows\r\ngreat complexity of structure, is not differentiated internally into\r\ncells, like the body of a metozoon. Consequently it differs from the\r\nlatter not in the number of its cellular constituents, but in lacking\r\nthese altogether. We therefore define the sub-kingdom of the protozoa\r\nas the group which contains _all non-cellular animals_.”\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that this view does not find favour with many\r\nzoologists, but it is useful in bringing into prominence the fact\r\nthat each protozoan is comparable as regards its functions with the\r\nmulti-cellular animals.\r\n\r\nThe protozoa are again further divided into four main classes:--\r\n\r\n    I. Rhizopoda.\r\n   II. Mastigophora.\r\n  III. Ciliophora.\r\n   IV. Sporozoa.\r\n\r\nOf the above classes, representatives of each of the first three are\r\nfound living in the soil, but up to the present there is no evidence\r\nthat any sporozoon is capable of living an active life in the soil,\r\nthough the cysts of such organisms may be present.\r\n\r\nThe class _RHIZOPODA_ consists of those protozoa whose organs of\r\nlocomotion and food capture are _pseudopodia_, that is, temporary\r\nextensions of the living protoplasm. The body is typically naked, that\r\nis to say, without any cuticular membrane, though in some forms, ex.\r\n_Amœbæ terricola_, the external layer of protoplasm is thickened to\r\nform a pellicle. A skeleton or shell may be present.\r\n\r\nThe class is further sub-divided into various sub-classes, only\r\ntwo of which concern the soil protozoologist, viz., the _Amœbæ_\r\nand the _Mycetozoa_, of which the most important representative is\r\n_Plasmodiophora brassicæ_, which attacks the roots of many cruciferous\r\nplants, causing the disease familiarly known as “Fingers and Toes.”\r\n\r\nThe _Amœbæ_ are again divided into two orders:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Nuda_, without shell or skeleton;\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Testacea_, with shells often termed _Thecamœbæ_.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the “naked” amœbæ commonly found in soils are\r\n_Nægleria (Dimastigamœba) gruberi_, _Amœba diploidea_ (possessing\r\ntwo nuclei) and _A. terricola_, the last two forms possessing a\r\ncomparatively thick skin or pellicles. _Trinema enchelys_, _Difflugia\r\nconstricta_ and _Chlamydophrys stercorea_ are examples of soil\r\nThecamœbæ.\r\n\r\nThe class _MASTIGOPHORA_ consists of those protozoa whose typical modes\r\nof progression are by means of flagella, whip-like filaments which, by\r\ntheir continual lashing motion, cause movement of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe body may be naked or corticate. The only organisms which concern\r\nthe soil biologist belong to the _Flagellata_ order.\r\n\r\nThe Flagellates differ considerably among themselves, both as regards\r\ntheir mode of feeding, and the number of flagella, thus making their\r\nclassification difficult and outside the scope of this book. Suffice\r\nit to say that in the soil such organisms occur possessing one, two,\r\nthree or four flagella, ex. _Oicomonas termo_, _Heteromita globosus_,\r\n_Dallengeria_ and _Tetramitus spiralis_. Further, their mode of feeding\r\nmay be _saprophytic_ in which nourishment is absorbed by diffusion\r\nthrough the body surface in the form of soluble organic substances,\r\n_holozoic_ where solid food particles are taken in, or _holophytic_ in\r\nwhich food is synthesised by the energy of sunlight. This last group\r\nis commonly spoken of as the _Phyto flagellates_, which are to all\r\nintents and purposes unicellular algæ, and as such will be dealt with\r\nin Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nThe class _CILIOPHORA_ consists of those protozoa whose typical organs\r\nof locomotion are threads or cilia. These organisms can in one sense\r\nbe regarded as the highest of the protozoa, since in no other division\r\ndoes the body attain so great a complexity of structure. Moreover, they\r\nare typically characterised by a complicated nuclear apparatus with\r\nthe vegetative and generative portions separated into distinct bodies,\r\nthe macro-nucleus and the micro-nucleus. Their mode of nutrition is\r\n_holozoic_, though recently Peters has brought forward evidence that\r\ncertain species can obtain their nourishment saprophytically.\r\n\r\nThe sub-class Ciliata comprises four orders, all of which are\r\nrepresented in the soil.\r\n\r\nI. _Holotricha._ The cilia are equal in length and uniformly\r\ndistributed over the whole body in the primitive forms, though\r\nrestricted to special regions in the specialised forms. Typical soil\r\nforms are _Colpoda cucullus_, _Colpidium colpoda_.\r\n\r\nII. _Heterotricha._ There is a uniform covering of cilia, and a\r\nconspicuous spiral zone of larger cilia forming a vibratile membrane\r\nand leading to the mouth.\r\n\r\nIII. _Hypotricha._ The body is flattened dorso-ventrally and the cilia\r\nare often fused to form larger appendages or cirri confined to the\r\nventral surface. Movement is typically a creeping one. Typical soil\r\nforms are _Pleurotricha_, _Gastrostylis_, _Oxytricha_.\r\n\r\nIV. _Peritricha._ Typically of a sedentary habit and the cilia are\r\nreduced to a zone round the adoral region of the body. A typical soil\r\nform is _Vorticella microstomum_.\r\n\r\nThe above classification is far from complete, but should be sufficient\r\nto give an idea of the general grouping of the organisms. For a more\r\ndetailed account reference must be made to the numerous text books on\r\nprotozoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORIES.\r\n\r\nThe life history of each species has its own characteristic features as\r\nregards nuclear division, etc., and in many forms, notably the amœbæ,\r\nit is impossible to identify them with certainty unless the chief\r\nstages of the life history are known. In general, however, the soil\r\nprotozoa pass through very similar phases and develop in a perfectly\r\nstraightforward way. Broadly speaking, there are two main phases of\r\nthe life history--a period of activity often mistermed vegetative, and\r\na period of rest. In the former the animal moves, feeds and reproduces,\r\nwhile in the latter there is secreted round the body a thick wall,\r\ncapable of resisting adverse external influences. This condition is\r\ntermed the cystic stage, and by means of it the animals are distributed\r\nfrom place to place by air, water, etc. Indeed, so resistant are the\r\ncysts that many of them are capable of withstanding the action of the\r\ndigestive juices of the intestines of animals, through which they pass\r\nto be deposited by the fæces on fresh ground.\r\n\r\nThis cystic stage of the life history is found in practically all\r\nfree-living protozoa, though it is not formed in exactly the same\r\nmanner in every case. In the majority of instances the cyst is the\r\nproduct of a single organism, round which is formed a delicate\r\ngelatinous substance which soon hardens and gradually acquires the\r\npeculiar characters of the wall. Concerning the chemical nature of this\r\nwall there is little known, but Goodey,[11] working on the cysts of\r\n_Colpoda cucullus_, found it to be formed of a carbohydrate, different\r\nfrom all carbohydrates previously described, to which the name “Cytose”\r\nwas given. When in this state the animals are able to remain dormant\r\nfor considerable periods until favourable conditions once more obtain\r\nwhen the wall is ruptured and the animal again resumes the active phase\r\nof its life history. This simple process is characteristic of such\r\nspecies as _Heteromita globosus_, _Cercomonas spp._, and many others.\r\nIt will be noted that no increase of numbers, i.e. reproduction,\r\noccurs. A more complex condition is, however, sometimes found, as, for\r\nexample, in the ciliate _Colpoda steinii_, where actual reproduction\r\ninto small animals takes place within the cyst.\r\n\r\nFinally there is the less common type of cyst formation, such as is\r\nfound in the flagellate _Oicomonas termo_ described by Martin.[19] This\r\nflagellate, in common with all other forms, reproduces by dividing into\r\ntwo; the division of the nucleus initiating the process. At certain\r\nundetermined periods of the life history, however, conjugation occurs\r\nbetween two similar animals forming a large biflagellate body known as\r\nthe zygote. After swimming about for varying periods of time, during\r\nwhich the size increases and a large vacuole appears, the zygote\r\nsecretes a thick wall, loses its flagella, and becomes a cyst. While in\r\nthis condition the two gamete nuclei fuse to form one, and eventually a\r\nsingle _Oicomonas_ emerges from its cyst.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in _A. diploidea_ the cysts are formed after two individuals\r\nhave come together. In the young cysts two amœbæ are found in close\r\nassociation, and according to Hartmann and Nägler[12] a sexual process\r\noccurs inside the cyst involving a “reductive” division of the nuclei.\r\nThis requires confirmation, but it is certain that only one individual\r\ncomes out of the cysts, which originally contained two amœbæ.\r\n\r\nSuch cysts have been termed by some writers “reproductive,” evidently a\r\nmisleading term, since no increase in numbers, but rather a decrease,\r\nresults from the process. A better term is, perhaps, conjugation cyst.\r\n\r\nIn soil protozoa, then, three different modes of cyst formation obtain,\r\nand failure to make the distinction inevitably leads to confusion.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the question of life histories, reference must be made\r\nto a peculiar and characteristic feature of _Nægleria gruberi_. This\r\namœba under certain circumstances assumes a free-swimming biflagellate\r\nstage. After variable periods of time the flagella are lost and the\r\nordinary amœboid condition resumed. What are the factors concerned in\r\nthe production of flagellates is unknown, but flooding the coverslips\r\nwith distilled water is an effective method for causing their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF SOIL PROTOZOA.\r\n\r\nFor both the bacteria and algæ observations have been made regarding\r\ntheir distribution through successive depths of the soil; little can\r\nbe said, however, about the protozoa in this connection. It is certain\r\nthat they occur throughout the first six inches of the Rothamsted\r\nsoils, though their relative frequencies in the successive inches has\r\nnot been determined, but probably they are most abundant in the 2nd to\r\nthe 4th inch.\r\n\r\nIn this country experiments have not been made to determine whether\r\nsub-soil normally contains protozoa; but from some South African\r\nsoil, taken under sterile conditions 4 ft. down and examined in this\r\nlaboratory, large numbers of protozoa were cultivated.\r\n\r\nThis soil, however, could not, for various reasons, be regarded as a\r\ntypical sub-soil.\r\n\r\nKofoid records the presence of _Nægleria gruberi_ in clay and rock\r\ntalus taken from the sides of excavations of over 20 ft. depth, but the\r\npossibility of external infection does not appear to have been excluded.\r\n\r\nThe presence of protozoa is not peculiar to British soil since they\r\nhave been found by various workers in Germany, France, the United\r\nStates, and elsewhere. In view of their probable importance in the soil\r\neconomy there has been instituted a survey of the protozoan species of\r\nsoil from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThis work is in charge of Mr. Sandon, to whom I am indebted for the\r\nfollowing summary of his as yet unpublished research.\r\n\r\n“The majority of soil protozoa (like the fresh-water forms) appear to\r\nbe quite cosmopolitan, for the species found in such widely separated\r\nlocalities as England, Spitsbergen, Africa, West Indies, Gough Island\r\n(in the South Atlantic) and Nauru (in the Pacific) are, with few\r\nexceptions, identical. This distribution indicates an ability to\r\nwithstand an extremely wide range of conditions, for the same species\r\noccurring in Arctic soils, which are frozen for the greater part of\r\nthe year, are found also in soils exposed to the direct rays of the\r\ntropical sun. Even sand from the Egyptian desert contains protozoa,\r\nthough it seems probable that in such cases they must be present only\r\nin the encysted condition for the greater part of the time.\r\n\r\n“Not every sample of soil, however, contains all the species capable\r\nof living in soil, but the local conditions determining the presence\r\nor absence of any species are at present unknown. In general the\r\nnumbers, both of species and of individuals present, follow the number\r\nof bacteria. They are consequently most numerous in rich moist soils.\r\nThe statement sometimes made that protozoa are most numerous in peaty\r\nsoils is based solely on the number of Rhizopod shells found in such\r\nlocalities; but as most of these shells are empty, their abundance is\r\nprobably due simply to the slowness with which they disintegrate in\r\nthese soils where bacterial activity is low, they do not indicate a\r\ngreat protozoal activity. Active protozoa do occur even in extremely\r\nacid soils, but their numbers in such cases are low. The common soil\r\nprotozoa, in fact, appear to be as tolerant of differences in soil\r\nacidity as they are of differences in climate, for many of the same\r\nforms which occur in acid soils are found also in soils containing\r\nhigh percentages of chalk. It is possible that some of the less common\r\nspecies may be confined within closer limits of external conditions but\r\nthe information available on this point is inadequate. All the species,\r\nhowever, which in Rothamsted soils occur in the highest numbers (e.g.\r\n_Oicomonas termo_, _Heteromita spp._, _Cercomonas crassicauda_,\r\n_Nægleria gruberi_, _Colpoda cucullus_, _C. steinii_) occur in\r\npractically every soil which is capable of supporting vegetation,\r\nthough, of course, in very varying numbers.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the protozoa must be regarded as\r\nconstituting part of the normal micro-organic population of soils,\r\nand as such are probably playing an important rôle. Unfortunately our\r\nknowledge of the physiology of these organisms is extremely scant, and\r\nmuch of future research must be directed towards elucidating their\r\nfunctions and their responses to varying environmental conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROTOZOA OF THE SOIL, II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter an outline has been given of the development\r\nof the study of soil protozoa, with especial reference to its\r\nqualitative aspects.\r\n\r\nHere it is proposed to deal with the quantitative methods which have\r\nbeen devised for studying these organisms and the results obtained.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning great difficulty has been encountered in finding\r\nmeans for counting protozoa; and most of the early results have been\r\nobtained by the use of one of the following methods: (1) direct counts\r\nin a known volume of soil suspension by means of a microscope; (2)\r\ndilution method as used for counting bacteria, and suggested by Rahn,\r\nwho made dilutions of the soil and determined, by examination at\r\nperiodic intervals, the one above which protozoa did not grow; (3) Agar\r\nplating as used by Killer; (4) counting per standard loop of suspension\r\nas devised by Müller. Of these the two last have been little used,\r\nand for various reasons are now discarded by most workers. Direct\r\nmethods have been used extensively in the United States by Koch[13]\r\nand others,[16] who claim to have got satisfactory results; they are,\r\nhowever, highly inaccurate and should be discontinued. The present\r\nwriter[3] has shown that there exists a surface energy relationship\r\nbetween the soil particles and the protozoa, so that the two are always\r\nin intimate contact; thus rendering it impossible to count under the\r\nmicroscope the number of organisms in a given weight of soil suspension\r\n(Fig. 9). Further, in a clay soil, such as is found at Rothamsted, the\r\nclay particles alone make it very difficult to use such methods.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of this surface energy relationship affords an\r\neffective rejoinder to the criticism made against Russell and\r\nHutchinson’s hypothesis, viz., that soil protozoa must be very few in\r\nnumbers, since it was impossible to see them on examining soil under\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Showing the number of amœbæ and flagellates\r\nwithdrawn from suspensions of varying strengths by different types of\r\nsolid matter. A = clay: B = partially sterilized soil: C = ignited\r\nsoil: D = fine sand: E = waste sand. Since complete withdrawal occurs\r\nwhen the numbers of organisms added are less than the capacity of the\r\nsolid matter, the first part of each of the above curves is coincident\r\nwith the ordinate. The numbers of organisms are given in thousands.\r\n(From Journ. Agric. Soc., vol. ix.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis: Number of Organisms per c.c. left in Solution.\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Number of Organisms per c.c. taken up by Solid Matter.]\r\n\r\nThe second or dilution method is the one, therefore, that has been most\r\nextensively developed.\r\n\r\nCunningham obtained concordant results in this way, and his method,\r\nmodified by L. M. Crump, was as follows: 10 grams of soil were added\r\nto 125 c.c. of sterile tap-water and shaken for three minutes. This\r\ngives a 1 in 12·5 dilution. From it further dilutions were made\r\nuntil a sufficiently high one was obtained. Petri dishes, containing\r\nnutrient agar, were inoculated with 1 c.c. of each of the dilutions and\r\nincubated. At intervals covering 28 days the plates were examined and\r\nthe presence or absence of protozoa on each recorded. In this way the\r\napproximate number of organisms per gram of soil could be found.\r\n\r\nBy methods essentially similar to this numerous counts have been made\r\nof the bacteria and protozoa in field soil and in partially sterilized\r\nsoils. They were, however, inconclusive; thus, on the one hand,\r\nGoodey and several American observers, found no correlation between\r\nthe numbers of protozoa and bacteria, while Miss Crump and Cunningham\r\nobtained evidence pointing to the reverse conclusion.\r\n\r\nSuch divergence of opinion was probably mainly due to two causes:\r\nfirstly, that the time elapsing between the successive counts was too\r\nlong, for it has been shown recently that the number of bacteria and\r\nprotozoa fluctuate very rapidly; and secondly, the method was not\r\ncompletely satisfactory since only the total numbers of protozoa were\r\nconsidered, no means having been found of differentiating between the\r\ncystic and active forms. This was a particularly serious source of\r\nerror for it is possible for soil to contain large numbers of bacteria\r\nand protozoa, of which a high percentage of the latter are in the form\r\nof cysts. A count made on such a soil would give results apparently\r\nopposed to the theory that protozoa act as depressors of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty has, however, been overcome by a further modification\r\nof the dilution method, and it is now possible in any soil sample\r\nto count both the numbers of cysts and active forms. Also a further\r\nadvance in technique has made it possible to recognise and enumerate\r\nthe common species of protozoa, instead of simply grouping them as\r\nCiliates, Flagellates, and Amœbæ, as was done in the past.[7]\r\n\r\nBriefly the method consists in dividing the soil sample into equal\r\nportions (usually 10 grams each) one of which is counted, thus giving\r\nthe total numbers of protozoa (active + cystic) present. The second\r\nportion is treated over-night with 2 per cent. hydrochloric acid, the\r\nHCl used being B.P. pure 31·8 per cent. Previous experiments have shown\r\nthat such acid kills all the active protozoa, leaving viable the cysts.\r\nThe number of cysts is therefore found by counting this treated sample,\r\nand the number obtained subtracted from the total gives the active\r\nnumber.[F]\r\n\r\n  [F] The proof of the accuracy of this method will be found in the\r\n  following papers:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Cutler, D. W. (1920), Journ. Agric. Sci., vol. x., 136-143.\r\n\r\n  (2) Cutler, D. W., and Crump, L. M. (1920), Ann. App. Biol., vol.\r\n  vii., 11-24.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this method at once puts into the hands of the\r\ninvestigator a much more efficient instrument for studying the\r\nactivities of the soil micro-population, especially since at a slightly\r\nlater date Thornton’s method for counting bacteria was devised.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1920 Cutler and Crump[6] decided to make a preliminary survey\r\nof the protozoon and bacterial populations of one of the Rothamsted\r\nfield soils (Broadbalk dunged plot). The investigation was continued\r\nfor 28 days, daily soil samples being taken. The results so obtained\r\nshowed that an extended investigation of the micro-population of field\r\nsoil would yield interesting and important results, especially as\r\nit was evident that certain views held by soil biologists required\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nIn July of the same year, therefore, it was decided to start an\r\nextended investigation of the soil protozoa and bacteria. The method\r\nadopted was to make counts of the numbers of bacteria and of six[G]\r\nspecies of protozoa in soil samples taken daily direct from the field\r\n(Barnfield dunged plot) and by statistical methods to correlate these\r\ncounts one with another and with the data for external conditions.\r\nObservations at shorter periods than 24 hours could not be made, but it\r\nwas found possible to continue the research for 365 days.[7]\r\n\r\n  [G] Actual counts were made of six species, though, as stated on p.\r\n  10, observations were made on seventeen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Daily numbers of active amœbæ (Dimastigamœba\r\nand Species α) and bacteria in 1 gram of field soil, from August 29 to\r\nOctober 8, 1920.

The size of the changes that took place within\r\nso short a period as 24 hours was, perhaps, the most surprising fact\r\nthat the experiment revealed. Thus three consecutive samples gave\r\n58·0, 14·25 and 26·25 millions of bacteria per gram respectively; and\r\nthe changes exhibited by any of the species of protozoa were at times\r\neven larger. This fact is of extreme importance, since in the past it\r\nhas always been assumed that the number of bacteria remained fairly\r\nconstant from day to day, and investigators have not hesitated to\r\nseparate the taking of soil samples by long periods. It is now obvious\r\nthat such a procedure is of little use for comparative purposes (Fig.\r\n10).\r\n\r\nIt has usually been assumed that the changes in the external conditions\r\nmarkedly affect the density of the soil population. To test this the\r\nenvironmental conditions--temperature, moisture content and rainfall\r\nwere examined; but contrary to all expectation no connection could be\r\ntraced between any of these and the daily changes in numbers of any\r\nof the organisms investigated, and moreover the species of protozoa\r\nappeared in the main to be living independently of one another.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that external conditions are as inoperative\r\nas appears from the above; and in view of the known complexity of\r\nthe soil it is possible that further research will show that certain\r\ncombinations of external conditions are important agents in effecting\r\nthe changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Numbers of active amœbæ (Dimastigamœba and\r\nSpecies α) and bacteria to 1 gram of field soil for typical periods in\r\nFebruary and April, 1921.

This was well shown during the\r\nyear’s count, for with only 14 per cent. of exceptions, 10 per cent.\r\nof which can be explained as due to rapid excystation or encystation,\r\na definite inverse relationship was established between the active\r\nnumbers of amœbæ and the number of bacteria (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus a\r\nrise from one day to the next in the amœbic population was correlated\r\nwith a fall in the numbers of bacteria and vice versa. It must not be\r\nsupposed that the flagellates are of no account in this process; some\r\nspecies, known to eat bacteria, undoubtedly induce slight depressions,\r\nbut, owing to their small size, any effect is masked by the greater\r\none of the amœbæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Numbers of active amœbæ (Dimastigamœba and\r\nSpecies α) and bacteria in 1 gram of field soil for typical periods in\r\nSeptember, October, and November, 1920.\r\n\r\n  X-axis: August September October\r\n\r\n  Y-axis (left): Amoebae, thousands\r\n\r\n  Y-axis (right): Millions, Bacteria\r\n\r\n  Legend: Dimastigamoeba\r\n\r\n  Species α\r\n\r\n  Bacteria]\r\n\r\nThese experiments seem to admit of no doubt that in field soil the\r\nactive protozoa are instrumental in keeping down, below the level\r\nthey might otherwise have attained, the numbers of bacteria; but a\r\nfurther proof of this contention ought to be obtained by inoculation\r\nexperiments. It should be possible, by inoculating sterile soil\r\nwith bacteria alone and with bacteria plus protozoa, to demonstrate\r\nfluctuations in bacterial numbers in the latter, while those of the\r\nformer remained constant. This admittedly crucial test has often been\r\ntried, but owing to difficulties in technique, etc., has always failed.\r\nRecently, however, by using new methods confirmatory results have been\r\nobtained.[5]\r\n\r\nOrdinary field soil was sterilised by heat at 100° C. for 1 hour on\r\nfour successive days; it was then divided into equal portions, one of\r\nwhich was inoculated with three known species of bacteria, and the\r\nother inoculated with the same number of bacteria plus the cysts of the\r\ncommon soil amœba _Nægleria gruberi_. The numbers of bacteria in each\r\nsoil were counted daily for the first eight days and then daily from\r\nthe 15th to the 21st day after the experiment started. The results are\r\ngiven in Table VII. and Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nTABLE VII.\r\n\r\n  +------------+---------+--------+\r\n  | Numbers of | Control | Control|\r\n  | Days after |(Bacteria|Bacteria|\r\n  |Inoculation.|  alone).|+ Amœbæ.|\r\n  +------------+---------+--------+\r\n  |     0      |   13·0  |   12·2 |\r\n  |     1      |   48·6  |   35·4 |\r\n  |     2      |   97·6  |  117·2 |\r\n  |     3      |  127·0  |  178·4 |\r\n  |     4      |  154·8  |  154·4 |\r\n  |     5      |  196·8  |  177·0 |\r\n  |     6      |  214·4  |  151·8 |\r\n  |     7      |  193·4  |   75·6 |\r\n  |     8      |  165·2  |   65·8 |\r\n  |    15      |  169·2  |   72·8 |\r\n  |    16      |  174·8  |   30·2 |\r\n  |    17      |  175·6  |   53·2 |\r\n  |    18      |  168·4  |   82·8 |\r\n  |    19      |  160·4  |   43·8 |\r\n  |    20      |  171·2  |   70·8 |\r\n  |    21      |  176·2  |   28·2 |\r\n  +------------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\n  The numbers of bacteria are given in millions per gram of soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Numbers of bacteria counted daily in soils\r\ncontaining\r\n\r\n  A. Bacteria alone.\r\n  B. Same Bacteria as in A + Amœbæ.\r\n  C. Same Bacteria as in A + Flagellates.\r\n\r\n(From Ann. Appl. Biol., vol. x.)]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the numbers of bacteria in each soil rose\r\nsteadily until a maximum was reached 6-8 days after inoculation. This\r\nis in accordance with expectation, since the reproductive rate of\r\nbacteria is much greater than that of the amœbæ, which, until their\r\nactive forms are numerous, will not exert any appreciable influence on\r\nthe bacterial population. Further, since the protozoa were inoculated\r\nas cysts an appreciable time would elapse before excystation took\r\nplace. The last seven days of the experiment are of particular\r\ninterest. During this period the amœbæ were known to be active in the\r\nsoil, and were depressing the bacterial numbers, for in the control\r\n(protozoa-free) soil the variation in numbers was within experimental\r\nerror, while in the other soil the variations were considerable and\r\nwell outside experimental error. In fact the variations were comparable\r\nwith those found from day to day in untreated field soils. Finally,\r\nthe experiment shows that the bacteria in protozoa-free soil are able\r\nto maintain high numbers for a longer period than those living in\r\nassociation with protozoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASONAL CHANGES.\r\n\r\nSuperimposed on the daily variations in numbers there are seasonal\r\nchanges, as is clearly shown when fourteen day averages are made of\r\nthe numbers for each species. Bacteria have long been known to show\r\nautumn and spring rises, but recent research has demonstrated that the\r\nprotozoan population also rises to a maximum at the end of November,\r\nwith a less marked spring rise at the end of March and beginning of\r\nApril (Figs. 14 and 15).\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been claimed that the numbers of soil organisms are\r\nclosely linked with the soil moisture, but no support for this view\r\nwas found during the course of the experiment. Similarly, as in the\r\ncase of the daily variations, no connection could be traced between the\r\nseasonal changes and any of the external conditions considered.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, however, that the seasonal variations in the\r\nnumbers of soil organisms is very similar to those recorded for many\r\naquatic organisms. Miss Delf,[8] for instance, found that in ponds at\r\nHampstead the algæ are most numerous in spring and again in the autumn,\r\nand like changes are recorded in British lakes by West and West[25] and\r\nin the Illinois river by Kofoid.[14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Fortnightly averages of total numbers of\r\nOicomonas, Species γ, and Species α, and of bacteria, moisture, and\r\ntemperature.

This is substantiated by the fact that the\r\nnumbers of protozoa, except those of _Oicomonas_, rose during March,\r\nwhereas the corresponding increase in the bacteria was delayed till the\r\nearly part of April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Fortnightly averages of total numbers of\r\nHeteromita, Cercomonas, and Dimastigamœba and of bacteria, moisture,\r\nand temperature.

Some idea of the size of the soil population\r\ncan be obtained, nevertheless, by using the fourteen-day averages\r\nmentioned above. In Table VIII. are tabulated the average total numbers\r\nof flagellates, and amœbæ for the two periods of the year when the\r\npopulation was at its maximum and minimum respectively. An endeavour\r\nhas also been made to strike a rough balance sheet as to the amount of\r\nprotoplasm represented by protozoa and bacteria in a ton of soil. For\r\nthis purpose it has been assumed that the organisms have a specific\r\ngravity of 1·0 and are spheres of diameters, 6µ for the flagellates,\r\n10µ for the amœbæ, and 1µ for the bacteria; and that they are uniformly\r\ndistributed through the top nine inches of soil. The top nine inches of\r\nsoil is taken as weighing 1000 tons.\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---------------------------+---------------------------+\r\n  |           |      Maximum Period.      |      Minimum Period.      |\r\n  |           + ____________/\\___________ + ____________/\\___________ +\r\n  |           |(                         )|(                         )|\r\n  |           |   No.    | Weight | Weight|  No. per | Weight | Weight|\r\n  |           |   per    |in Gram |in Tons|   Gram.  |in Gram |in Tons|\r\n  |           |  Gram.   |  per   |  per  |          |  per   |  per  |\r\n  |           |          | Gram.  | Acre. |          | Gram.  | Acre. |\r\n  +-----------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+\r\n  |Flagellates|   770,000|0·000087| 0·087 |   350,000|0·000039| 0·039 |\r\n  |Amœbæ      |   280,000|0·000147| 0·147 |   150,000|0·000078| 0·078 |\r\n  |Bacteria   |40,000,000|0·000020| 0·02  |22,500,000|0·000012| 0·012 |\r\n  +-----------+----------+--------+-------+----------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the above figures are minimum ones, as many\r\nspecies of bacteria and protozoa, known to occur in the soil, are not\r\nincluded in the statement owing to their not appearing on the media\r\nused for counting purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Daily variations in the numbers of active\r\nindividuals of a species of flagellate, _Oicomonas termo_ (Ehrenb.)\r\nduring March, 1921. (From Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., vol. ccxi.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis: March\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Active numbers per gramme of soil]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the discussion of daily variations in numbers of\r\nprotozoa, reference must be made to the flagellate species. As already\r\nmentioned, their active numbers fluctuate rapidly, and for the most\r\npart entirely irregularly. One species, however, _Oicomonas termo_, is\r\ncharacterised by possessing a periodic change; high active numbers on\r\none day being succeeded by low, which are again followed by high on the\r\nthird day. This rhythm was maintained, with few exceptions, for 365\r\ndays (Fig. 16), and has been shown to take place in artificial culture\r\nkept under controlled laboratory conditions (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Daily variations in the numbers of active\r\nindividuals of _Oicomonas termo_ (Ehrenb.) in artificial culture media\r\nkept at a constant temperature of 20° C. A, in hay infusion; B, in egg\r\nalbumen.\r\n\r\n  X-axis: Days\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: Thousands]\r\n\r\nIt was thought that an explanation of this phenomenon might be found\r\nin alternate excystation and encystation, since the latter is a\r\nconstituent part of the animals’ life history (see p. 73). This,\r\nhowever, does not hold, for the cyst curve is not the inverse of that\r\nof the active; and, moreover, statistical treatment demonstrated that\r\ncyst formation is wholly unperiodic in character.\r\n\r\nAn explanation must therefore be sought in the changes in the\r\norganisms during the active period of their life, and the deduction\r\ncan be drawn that, increased active numbers tend to be followed by\r\ndeath, conjugation, or both, while decreases in the active numbers\r\nare followed by rises in total numbers, i.e., reproduction, and this\r\nrhythmically.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat surprising conclusion appears to hold, in a lesser\r\ndegree, for other soil protozoa, and is of sufficient importance\r\nto warrant further research. The direction in which this is being\r\npursued is by a study of the reproductive rates of pure cultures of\r\ncertain ciliates and flagellates under varying external conditions.\r\nSpace does not admit of adequate discussion of this problem, but the\r\nresults already obtained justify the view that such lines of work will\r\nelucidate some of the baffling problems of soil micro-biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL REACTION.\r\n\r\nThe development of the artificial fertiliser industry has in many\r\nways revolutionised farm practice, with the inevitable result that\r\nnew problems have arisen, not the least of which are biological in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIf, as seems to be indubitable, the micro-organisms of the soil are of\r\nimportance to soil fertility, it is necessary for us to know in what\r\nway this population is affected by the application of fertilisers,\r\nand a start has been made by investigating the effects of hydrogen\r\nion concentration on soil protozoa. Much has already been written\r\nconcerning this question, but almost entirely on results obtained\r\nin artificial cultures. It is always dangerous to argue from the\r\nartificial to the natural environment of organisms and particularly\r\nso in respect to the soil. Also, as Collett has shown, the toxic\r\neffects of acids are probably not entirely a function of the hydrogen\r\nion concentration, but that the molecules of certain acids are in\r\nthemselves toxic, an action which can, however, be diminished by the\r\nantagonistic powers of many substances such as NaCl.\r\n\r\nIn this laboratory S. M. Nasir, by unpublished work, has shown that\r\nthe limiting value on the acid side for _Colpoda cucullus_ was P_{H}\r\n3·3; for a flagellate (_Heteromita globosus_), 3·5; and for an amœba\r\n(_Nægleria gruberi_), 3·9.\r\n\r\nAlso Mlle. Perey, investigating the numbers of protozoa in one of the\r\nRothamsted grass plots of P_{H} 3·65, found a total of 13,600 protozoa,\r\nof which 90 per cent. were active.\r\n\r\nThe tolerance, therefore, of these organisms to varying external\r\nconditions is greater than has formerly been supposed, a conclusion\r\nwhich is becoming more evident from the researches mentioned in Chapter\r\nIV. on soils from different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOZOA AND THE NITROGEN CYCLE.\r\n\r\nIn partially-sterilised soil from which protozoa were absent Russell\r\nand Hutchinson obtained an increased ammonia production, a result\r\nalso obtained by Cunningham. Hill, on the other hand, concluded that\r\nprotozoa have no effect on ammonification, but his technique is open to\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nLipman, Blair, Owen and McLean’s work[17] contains many figures\r\nobtained by adding dried blood, tankage, soluble blood flour,\r\ncottonseed meal, soy-bean meal, wheat flour, corn meal, etc., to soil.\r\nIt is difficult to understand how accurate results could be expected\r\nwhen, to an already little understood complex substance, such as soil,\r\nis added a series of substances whose effects are practically unknown.\r\n\r\nFree nitrogen-fixation in soils is an important process, more\r\nespecially in soils of a light sandy nature, from which crops are\r\ntaken year after year without any application of manure. The effect of\r\nprotozoa on the organisms causing this process has in the past received\r\nlittle attention. Recently, however, Nasir[20] has studied the\r\ninfluence of protozoa on Azotobacter, both in artificial culture and in\r\nsand. From a total of 36 experiments done in duplicate or triplicate,\r\n31 showed a decided gain in nitrogen fixation over the control, while\r\nonly 5 gave negative results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Showing the highest fixations of nitrogen\r\nabove the control recorded for Azotobacter in the presence of different\r\nspecies of Protozoa.

Biol., vol. ii.)\r\n\r\n  X-axis (left): Artificial Media C A F AF AC ACF\r\n\r\n  X-axis (right): Sand Cultures C A AF AC\r\n\r\n  Legend: C represents CILIATES.\r\n\r\n  A -do.- AMOEBAE.\r\n\r\n  F -do.- FLAGELLATES.]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the fixation figures varied from culture to\r\nculture, the highest recorded being 36·04 per cent. above the control\r\nand this in a sand culture (Fig. 18). Reference to the details of the\r\nexperiments shows that the criticisms made against similar work done in\r\nthe past do not hold here, and one must conclude that Azotobacter is\r\ncapable of fixing more atmospheric nitrogen in the presence of protozoa\r\nthan in their absence.\r\n\r\nAt present it is impossible to say how this occurs, but it is highly\r\nimprobable that the protozoa are themselves capable of fixing nitrogen.\r\nA more likely explanation is that the protozoa, by consuming the\r\nAzotobacter, kept down the numbers, and transfer the nitrogen to their\r\nown bodies. This will tend to prevent the bacteria from reaching a\r\nmaximum density, and reproduction, involving high metabolism, will be\r\nmaintained for a longer period than would have otherwise occurred. This\r\nand other possible explanations, are being tested.\r\n\r\nLittle has been said regarding the application of protozoology to the\r\nquestion of soil partial sterilisation. As already pointed out, in\r\nthe past much work has been done, but the results were conflicting.\r\nIn view, however, of our recently acquired knowledge of the life of\r\nprotozoa in ordinary field soil, most of the early experiments require\r\nrepeating. A beginning has already been made, but the work is not\r\nsufficiently advanced to warrant discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat is urgently needed, however, is to increase our knowledge of the\r\ngeneral physiology of these unicellular animals. Until we know what\r\nare the inter-relationships between the members of the micro-organic\r\npopulation of normal soil it is almost impossible to hope that means\r\nwill be devised by which they can be controlled.\r\n\r\nAt present we are almost entirely ignorant of the simplest of\r\nphysiological reactions, such as the exact effect of various inorganic\r\nsalts found in the soil.\r\n\r\nAlso some experiments in Germany and the States indicate that amœbæ are\r\nselective as regards the bacteria they ingest. If this is substantiated\r\nit may prove of importance to economic biology.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the flagellates occur in the soil in large\r\nnumbers, and many of them feed on bacteria. It is probable, however,\r\nthat certain of them feed saprophytically and must therefore exert some\r\ninfluence on the soil solution, though what this may be is entirely\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Nasir has shown, the protozoa play a part in the\r\ncomplicated nitrogen cycle, and work of this type needs extending.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are a few of the outstanding problems that confront the\r\nsoil protozoologist; but he must always remember that the organisms he\r\nstudies are but a small fraction of the total, and that any influence\r\naffecting one part of the complex will be reflected in another. As\r\nProf. Arthur Thomson said in his Gifford Lectures, “No creature lives\r\nor dies to itself, there is no insulation. Long nutritive chains often\r\nbind a series of organisms together in the very fundamental relation\r\nthat one kind eats the others.” Such nutritive chains obtain in the\r\nsoil as markedly as in other haunts of living creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n* _Papers giving extensive bibliographies._\r\n\r\n  [1] Cunningham, A., Journ.

GENERAL AND HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, the organisms of the soil may be classified into\r\nseveral distinct groups differing conspicuously in their general\r\ncharacters and physiological functions and therefore in their economic\r\nsignificance; among such groups may be mentioned the bacteria,\r\nprotozoa, algæ and fungi. It is found, however, that though typical\r\nmembers of these groups are conspicuously different from one another,\r\nyet there exist a number of unicellular forms which have characters\r\nin common with more than one of these big groups, and the lines of\r\ndemarcation between them become difficult to define. It becomes\r\nadvisable, therefore, to depart a little from the systematist’s rigid\r\ndefinitions and to adopt a somewhat more logical grouping of the soil\r\norganisms based on their mode of life.\r\n\r\nTo give but a single example: _Euglena viridis_ occurs quite commonly\r\nin soil. Through its single flagellum, its lack of a definite cellulose\r\nwall, its changeable shape and its ability to multiply by simple\r\nfission in the motile state it definitely belongs systematically to the\r\ngroup of protozoa. But its possession of chlorophyll, in enabling it to\r\nsynthesise complex organic substances from CO₂ and water in a manner\r\nentirely typical of plants, connects it physiologically so closely with\r\nthe lower green algæ that in studying the biology of the soil it seems\r\nbest to include it and other nearly related forms with the algæ.\r\n\r\nOn this physiological basis “soil-algæ” may be defined as those\r\nmicro-organisms of the soil which have the power, under suitable\r\nconditions, to produce chlorophyll. Such a definition has the\r\nadvantage that it is wide enough to include the filamentous protonema\r\nof mosses, which, though alga-like in form and in physiological\r\naction, is nevertheless separated from the true algæ by a wide gulf.\r\nA more accurate name for such a group of organisms would be the\r\n“chlorophyll-bearing protophyta” of the soil; they may be classified\r\nbriefly as follows (Table IX.):--\r\n\r\nTABLE IX.\r\n\r\n  +----+------------------------------------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |    |               Group.               |  Colour.  |  Pigments.   |\r\n  +----+------------------+-----------------+-----------+--------------+\r\n  |  I.|_Flagellatæ._     |Euglenaceæ.      |Green.     |_Chlorophyll._|\r\n  |    |                  |Cryptomonadineæ. |           |              |\r\n  |    |                  |                 |           |              |\r\n  | II.|_Algæ_--          |                 |           |              |\r\n  |    | 1.

But the possibility of their having a very much wider economic\r\nsignificance was completely overlooked until about a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago, when Hensen demonstrated their importance in marine\r\nplankton as the producers of the organic substance upon which the\r\nwhole of the animal life of the ocean is ultimately dependent. In\r\nconsequence, it has been generally assumed that the growth of algæ,\r\nsince they contain chlorophyll, is entirely dependent on the action of\r\nlight. Hence the recent idea of the existence of algæ which actually\r\ninhabit the soil has been received with a certain amount of scepticism,\r\nthough the results of modern physiological research on a number of the\r\nlower algæ show that there is very good reason to believe that such a\r\nsoil flora is entirely possible.\r\n\r\nIn considering the alga-flora of a soil it is necessary to distinguish\r\nbetween two very different sets of conditions under which the organisms\r\nmay be growing. In the first place, they may grow on the surface of the\r\nsoil, being subjected directly to insolation, rain, the deposition of\r\ndew, the drying action of wind, relatively quick changes of temperature\r\nand other effects of climate. Certain combinations of these conditions\r\npresent so favourable an environment for the growth of algæ that at\r\ntimes there appears on the surface of the soil a conspicuous green\r\nstratum, sometimes so dark in colour as to appear almost black. Strata\r\nof this nature are well known, and in systematic works there are\r\nconstant references to species growing “on damp soil”; for instance, of\r\nthe 51 well-defined species of _Nostoc_ recognised by Forte, no less\r\nthan 31 are characterised as terrestrial. Such appearances, however,\r\nseem to have been regarded as sporadic and more or less accidental,\r\nrather than as the unusually luxuriant development of an endemic\r\npopulation, and have been frequently attributed to an excessively moist\r\ncondition of the soil due to defective drainage.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the algæ may be living within the soil itself,\r\naway from the action of sunlight and under somewhat more uniform\r\nconditions of moisture and temperature.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time the greater number of the investigations carried\r\nout in this subject have been of a systematic nature, and extremely\r\nlittle direct evidence has been obtained which can throw any light on\r\nthe subject of the economic significance of the soil algæ.\r\n\r\nThe earliest systematic work was carried out by Esmarch, in 1910-11,\r\nwho investigated by means of cultures the blue-green algæ of a number\r\nof soils from the German African Colonies, the samples being taken from\r\nthe surface and also from the lower layers of the soil. He obtained a\r\nconsiderable number of species and observed that in cultivated soils\r\nthey were not confined to the surface but occurred regularly to a depth\r\nof 10-25 cms. and occasionally as low as 40-50 cms. He attributed\r\ntheir existence in the lower layers to the presence of resting spores\r\ncarried down in the processes of cultivation, since his samples from\r\nuncultivated soils were unproductive.\r\n\r\nLater, Esmarch extended his investigations to a far larger\r\nnumber of samples, 395 in all, of soils of different types from\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. He found that blue-green algæ were very widely\r\ndistributed in soils of certain types, though they occurred rarely\r\nin uncultivated soils of low water-content, and he described no less\r\nthan 45 species of which 34 belonged to the _Oscillatoriaceæ_ and\r\n_Nostocaceæ_. Certain of the commoner species were obtained from soils\r\nof widely different types, as shown in Table X., while other forms\r\noccurred only rarely and with a much more limited distribution.\r\n\r\nTABLE X.--FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN COMMON SPECIES IN\r\nESMARCH’S SOIL SAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+----------------------------------------+\r\n  |                         |         Percentage of Samples          |\r\n  |                         |         containing given Alga.         |\r\n  |                         +--------------------+-------------------+\r\n  |                         |    Uncultivated    |    Cultivated     |\r\n  |                         |  Damp Sandy Soil.  |       Soils.      |\r\n  |                         +------+------+------+------+-----+------+\r\n  |                         |Shores|Shores|      |      |     |      |\r\n  |                         |  of  |  of  | Sea- |      |     |Marsh-|\r\n  |       Species.          | Elbe.|Lakes.|shore.|Sandy.|Clay.| land.|\r\n  +-------------------------+------+------+------+------+-----+------+\r\n  |Anabæna variabilis       | 46   | 43   |  9   | 10·3 | 60  | 46   |\r\n  |Anabæna torulosa         | 31   | 14·3 | 63·6 | 27·6 | 34·3| 56·4 |\r\n  |Cylindrospermum muscicola| 23   | 28·6 |  0   | 24   | 48·6| 59   |\r\n  |Cylindrospermum majus    |  0   | 14·3 |  0   | 38   | 40  | 33·3 |\r\n  |Nostoc Sp.

He further distinguished between\r\ncultivated land of two kinds, viz. arable land and grass land, and\r\nfound that on all types of soil grassland was richer in species than\r\nwas arable land.\r\n\r\nEsmarch examined, in addition, 129 samples taken from the lower layers\r\nof the soil immediately beneath certain of his surface samples, 107 at\r\n10-25 cms. and the rest at 30-50 cms. depth.\r\n\r\nIn cultivated soils, whether grassland or arable land, he found that\r\nblue-green algæ occurred almost invariably in the lower layers in those\r\nplaces bearing algæ on the surface and that, with rare exceptions, the\r\nalgæ found in the lower layers corresponded exactly to those on the\r\nsurface, except that with increasing depth there was a progressive\r\nreduction in the number of species.\r\n\r\nIn uncultivated, moist, sandy soils the agreement was far less\r\ncomplete, for though algæ were rarely absent from the lower layers\r\ntheir vertical distribution was frequently disturbed by the action\r\nof wind and rain. Other uncultivated soils not subject to periodic\r\ndisturbance were found to be uniformly lacking in algæ in the lower\r\nlayers, but as the limited number of samples examined came completely\r\nfrom places where there were no algæ on the surface this means very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nBy direct microscopic examination of soil Esmarch claims to have\r\nfound living filaments of blue-green algæ at various depths below the\r\nsurface. He realised, however, that there was no indication of the\r\nlength of time that such filaments had been buried, and therefore\r\nconducted a series of experiments from which he concluded that the\r\nperiod during which the algæ investigated could continue vegetatively\r\nin the soil after burial varied with different species from 5-12 weeks,\r\nbut that during the later part of the period the algæ gradually assumed\r\na yellowish-green colour.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Esmarch’s investigations were directed only\r\ntowards the blue-green algæ since observations made in this country\r\nindicate that such a series of records gives but a very incomplete\r\npicture of the soil flora as a whole.\r\n\r\nPetersen, in his “Danske Aërofile Alger” (1915) added considerably to\r\nour knowledge of soil algæ, especially of diatoms. Unfortunately he\r\nconfined his investigations of the green algæ to forms growing visibly\r\non the surface of the ground. He observed, however, that acid soils\r\npossessed a different flora from that commonly found on alkaline or\r\nneutral soils, the former being dominated by _Mesotænium violascens_,\r\n_Zygnema ericetorum_, and 2 spp. of _Coccomyxa_, while the latter were\r\ncharacterised by _Mesotænium macrococcum var._, _Hormidium_, 2 spp.,\r\nand _Vaucheria_, 3 spp.\r\n\r\nOf diatoms he obtained no less than 24 species and varieties from\r\narable and garden soils, and five characteristic of marshy soils, while\r\nfrom forest soils and dry heathland they appeared to be often absent.\r\nHe omitted all reference to blue-green algæ.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Robbins, examining a number of Colorado soils that contained\r\nunprecedented quantities of nitrate, obtained from them 18 species of\r\nblue-green algæ, 2 species of green algæ, and one diatom. Moore and\r\nKarrer have demonstrated the existence of a subterranean alga-flora of\r\nwhich _Protoderma viride_, the most constantly occurring species, was\r\nshown to multiply when buried to a depth of one metre.\r\n\r\nIn this country attention was first called to the subject by Goodey and\r\nHutchinson of Rothamsted who, in examining certain old stored soils\r\nfor protozoa, obtained also a number of blue-green forms which were\r\nsubmitted to Professor West for identification. This ability of certain\r\nalgal spores to retain their vitality for a long resting period was so\r\nvery striking that an investigation was begun at Birmingham in 1915 to\r\nascertain whether other forms were equally resistant. The investigation\r\nwas carried out on a large number of freshly collected samples of\r\narable and garden soils which were first aseptically air-dried for at\r\nleast a month and then grown in culture. No less than 20 species or\r\nvarieties of diatoms, 24 species of blue-green and 20 species of green\r\nalgæ were obtained from these cultures (Table XII.). In the majority\r\nof the samples there was found a central group of algæ, including\r\n_Hantzschia amphioxys_, _Trochiscia aspera_, _Chlorococcum humicola_,\r\n_Bumilleria exilis_ and rather less frequently _Ulothrix subtilis\r\nvar. variabilis_, while moss protonema was universally present. These\r\nspecies were thought to form the basis of an extensive ecological plant\r\nformation in which, by the inclusion of other typically terrestrial\r\nbut less widely distributed species smaller plant-associations were\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nIn certain of the soils, associations consisting very largely of\r\ndiatoms were present, and it is to be noted that the majority of the\r\nforms that have been described are of exceedingly small size. It is\r\ndoubtless this characteristic which enables them to withstand the\r\nconditions of drought to which the organisms of the soil are liable to\r\nbe subjected, small organisms having been shown to be better able to\r\nresist desiccation than are larger ones. Since the soil diatoms belong\r\nto the pennate type, they are further adapted to their mode of life by\r\ntheir power of locomotion, which enables them in times of drought to\r\nretire to the moister layers of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the soils examined in this work blue-green algæ were less\r\nuniversally present than were diatoms or green algæ, and the species\r\nfound appeared to be more local in occurrence. There seemed to be,\r\nhowever, an association between the three species, _Phormidium tenue_,\r\n_Ph. autumnale_, and _Plectonema Battersii_, at least two of the three\r\nspecies having been found together in no less than 16 of the samples,\r\nwhile all three occurred in 7 of them.\r\n\r\nTABLE XII.--ALGÆ IN DESICCATED ENGLISH SOILS.

Diatoms appeared most frequently in soils from old gardens,\r\nwhereas blue-green algæ were more characteristic of arable soils. The\r\ngreen algæ and moss protonema, on the other hand, were distributed\r\nuniversally.\r\n\r\nThe majority of green algæ typically found in soils are unicellular,\r\nbut a few filamentous forms occur. With the exception of _Vaucheria_\r\nspp. these are characterised, however, by an ability to break down\r\nin certain circumstances into unicellular or few-celled fragments, in\r\nwhich condition identification is often very difficult.\r\n\r\nIt was also found by cultural examination of a number of old stored\r\nsoils from Rothamsted that germination of the resting forms of a\r\nnumber of algæ could take place after an exceedingly long period of\r\nquiescence. No less than nine species of blue-green algæ, four species\r\nof green algæ, and one species of diatom were obtained from soils that\r\nhad been stored for periods of about forty years, the species with the\r\ngreatest power to retain their vitality being _Nostoc muscorum_ and\r\n_Nodularia Harveyana_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SOIL AS A SUITABLE MEDIUM FOR ALGAL GROWTH.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the recent advances that have been made in our\r\nknowledge of the mode of nutrition of many of the lower algæ, it would\r\nbe very difficult to account for the widespread occurrence of algæ in\r\nthe soil, for it is undoubtedly true of some of the more highly evolved\r\nalgæ that their mode of nutrition is entirely typical of that of green\r\nplants in general. The application of bacteriological technique to the\r\nalgæ, however, by Beijerinck, by Artari, and by Chodat and his pupils,\r\nand the introduction of pure-culture methods have led to a study of\r\nthe physiology of some of the lower algæ, in the hope of getting to\r\nunderstand some of the fundamental problems underlying the nutrition\r\nof organisms containing chlorophyll. It is impossible here to do more\r\nthan mention the names of a few of the more important of those who\r\nhave worked along these lines, such as Chodat, Artari, Grintzesco,\r\nPringsheim, Kufferath, Nakano, Boresch, Magnus and Schindler, and to\r\ncondense into a few sentences some of their more important conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is now established that although in the light the algæ are able to\r\nbuild up their substance from CO₂ and water containing dilute mineral\r\nsalts, yet in such conditions growth is sometimes very slow, and with\r\nsome species at any rate it is greatly accelerated by the addition of\r\na small quantity of certain organic compounds. The ability of the lower\r\nalgæ to use organic food materials varies specifically, quite closely\r\nrelated forms often reacting very differently to the same substance,\r\nbut there have been shown to be a considerable number of forms which\r\ncan make use of organic compounds to such an extent that they can\r\ngrow entirely independently of light. In such cases the nutrition\r\nof the organism becomes wholly saprophytic, and the chlorophyll may\r\nbe completely lost; it has frequently been observed, however, that\r\non suitable nutrient media, even in complete darkness, certain algæ\r\ncontinue to grow and retain their green colour, provided that a\r\nsufficient supply of a suitable nitrogenous compound is present.\r\n\r\n_Chlorella vulgaris_, an alga frequently found in soil, has been shown\r\nto be extremely plastic in its relations to food substances. Given only\r\na dilute mineral-salts solution as food source, it absorbs CO₂ from\r\nthe air, and grows in sunlight with moderate rapidity. The addition\r\nof glucose to the medium in the light greatly increases the rate and\r\namount of growth and the size of the cells, while in the dark the\r\ncolonies not only remain green but have been shown to develop more\r\nvigorously than in full daylight. The organism is also able to use\r\npeptone as a source of nitrogen in place of nitrates.\r\n\r\n_Stichococcus bacillaris_ and _Scenedesmus spp._, also occurring\r\nin soils, have been shown to be almost equally adaptable, though\r\nin these cases the organisms grow more slowly in the dark than on\r\nthe corresponding medium in the light. Liquefaction of gelatine by\r\nthe secretion of proteolytic enzymes has been shown to be a further\r\nproperty of certain species, resulting in the formation of amino acids\r\nsuch as glycocoll, phenylalanine, dipeptides, etc. This property is,\r\nhowever, possessed by only a limited number of species and in varying\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nUp to the present very little work of this kind has been done upon algæ\r\nactually taken from the soil, and our knowledge is therefore very\r\nscanty. Of the species so far examined all show considerable increase\r\nin growth on the addition to the medium of glucose and other sugars,\r\nand tend to be partially saprophytic; a few have been shown to liquefy\r\ngelatine to some extent.\r\n\r\nServettaz, Von Ubisch, and Robbins have also demonstrated that the\r\nprotonema of some mosses can make use of certain organic substances,\r\nespecially the sugars, and grow vigorously in the dark. It has been\r\nshown, however, that light is essential for the development of the moss\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nIt was thought at Rothamsted that some light might be thrown upon the\r\nactivities of the soil-algæ by making counts of the numbers present\r\nin samples of soil taken periodically within a circumscribed area.\r\nA dilution method similar to that in use in the protozoological\r\nlaboratory was adopted and applied to samples of arable soil taken\r\nfrom the surface, and at depths of 2, 4, 6 and 12 inches vertically\r\nbeneath. A considerable number of samples were examined in this way\r\nfrom two plots on Broadbalk wheat-field, viz.: the unmanured plot and\r\nthat receiving a heavy annual dressing of farmyard manure. The numbers\r\nin the unmanured soil were observed to fall far short of those in that\r\ncontaining a large amount of organic matter, while in both plots the\r\nnumbers varied considerably at different times of the year. The chief\r\nspecies in both plots were identical, and their vertical distribution\r\nwas fairly uniform, but it was observed that the numbers of individuals\r\nvaried according to the depth of the sample. The 6th and 12th inch\r\nsamples contained very few individuals of comparatively few species,\r\nbut the 4th inch samples yielded numbers that were not significantly\r\nless than those in the top inch. The 2nd inch sample was usually much\r\npoorer in individuals than either the top or the 4th inch.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that this method of counting is not really\r\nsatisfactory for the algæ, chiefly because it takes no account of the\r\nblue-green forms. The gelatinous envelope which encloses the filaments\r\nof these algæ prevents their breaking up into measurable units.\r\nAssuming, as appears to be the case for the two plots investigated,\r\nthat the blue-green algæ are at least as numerous as the green forms,\r\nthe total numbers should probably be at least twice as great as those\r\ncalculated. Taking 100,000 as a rough estimate of the number of algæ\r\nper gram of manured soil in a given sample, and assuming the cells to\r\nbe spherical and of average diameter 10µ, it has been calculated that\r\nthe volume of algal protoplasm present was at least 3 times that of\r\nthe bacteria though only one-third of that of the protozoa. This is\r\nprobably only a minimum figure for this sample.\r\n\r\nA soil population of this magnitude can not be without effect on the\r\nfertility of the soil. When growing on the surface of the ground\r\nexposed to sunlight the algæ must, by photosynthesis, add considerably\r\nto the organic matter of the soil, but when they live within the soil\r\nitself their nutrition must be wholly saprophytic, and they can be\r\nadding nothing either to the energy or to the food-content of the soil.\r\nHow these organisms fit into the general scheme of life in the soil is\r\nat present undetermined, and there is a wide field for research in this\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RELATION OF ALGÆ TO THE NITROGEN CYCLE\r\n\r\nProbably the most important limiting factor in British agriculture is\r\nthe supply of nitrogen available for the growing crop, and it seems\r\nlikely that the soil-algæ are intimately connected with this question\r\nin several ways.\r\n\r\nPeriodic efforts have been made during the last half century to\r\nestablish the fact that a number of the lower organisms, including\r\nthe green algæ, have the power of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and\r\nconverting it into compounds which are then available for higher\r\nplants. This property has been definitely established for certain\r\nbacteria, and rather doubtfully for some of the fungi, but until\r\nrecently no authentic proof had been produced that algæ by themselves\r\ncould fix nitrogen. The subject is too wide to be discussed in much\r\ndetail here.\r\n\r\nSchramm in America, working with pure cultures of algæ, tried for\r\nten years to establish the fact of nitrogen fixation, and failed\r\ncompletely; more recently Wann has extended Schramm’s work, and claims\r\nto have proved indisputably that, given media containing nitrates as\r\na source of nitrogen and a small amount of glucose, the seven species\r\nof algæ tested by him fixed atmospheric nitrogen to the extent of 4-54\r\nper cent. of the original nitrogen content of the medium. So important\r\na result needed corroboration, and Wann’s experiment, with some slight\r\nimprovements, was therefore repeated at Rothamsted last summer.\r\n\r\nThis work has not yet been published, but in the whole series of\r\nninety-six cultures, with four different species, each growing on\r\nsix different media, there is no evidence that nitrogen fixation has\r\ntaken place; but there has been a total recovery at the end of the\r\nexperiment of 98·93 per cent. of the original nitrogen supplied. On\r\nthe other hand, a flaw has been detected in Wann’s method of analysing\r\nthose media containing nitrates, sufficiently great to account for the\r\ndifferences he obtained between the initial and final nitrogen content\r\nof his cultures. Hence, though one hesitates to say that the algæ are\r\nunable, given suitable conditions, to fix atmospheric nitrogen, one\r\nmust admit that no one has yet proved that they can do so.\r\n\r\nIt is far more likely, however, that the experiments of Kossowitsch\r\nand others throw more light on the relation of soil algæ to\r\nnitrogen fixation. They affirm that greater fixation of nitrogen is\r\neffected by mixtures of bacteria and certain gelatinous algæ than\r\nby nitrogen-fixing bacteria alone, and that the addition of algæ to\r\ncultures of bacteria produces a stimulating effect only slightly less\r\nthan that of sugar. It is probable, therefore, that the algæ, in their\r\ngelatinous sheaths, provide easily available carbohydrates from which\r\nthe bacteria derive the energy essential to their work, and that\r\nnitrogen fixation in nature is due to the combined working of a number\r\nof different organisms rather than to the individual action of single\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nRussell and Richards have shown that the rate of loss of nitrogen by\r\nleaching from uncropped soils is far less than would be expected from\r\na purely chemical standpoint, and suggest that certain organisms are\r\npresent in the soil which, by absorbing nitrates and ammonium salts\r\nas they are formed, remove them from the soil solution and so help to\r\nconserve the nitrogen of the soil. It is probable that the soil algæ\r\nact in this manner, though to what extent has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. RELATION OF ALGÆ TO SOIL MOISTURE AND TO THE FORMATION OF HUMUS\r\nSUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nIn warmer countries than our own, especially those with an adequate\r\nrainfall, the significance of soil algæ is perhaps more obvious to\r\na casual observer. Treub states that after the complete destruction\r\nof the island of Krakatoa by volcanic eruption in 1883, the first\r\ncolonists to take possession of the island were six species of\r\nblue-green algæ, viz., _Tolypothrix_ sp., _Anabæna_ sp., _Symploca_\r\nsp., _Lyngbya_ 3 spp. Three years after the eruption these organisms\r\nwere observed to form an almost continuous gelatinous and hygroscopic\r\nlayer over the surface of the cinders and stones constituting the soil,\r\nand by their death and decay they rapidly prepared it for the growth\r\nof seeds brought to the island by visiting birds. Hence the new flora\r\nwhich soon established itself upon the island can be said to have\r\nhad its origin in the alga-flora which preceded it. Fritsch has also\r\nemphasised the importance of algæ in the colonisation of new ground in\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nWelwitsch ascribes the characteristic colour from which the “pedras\r\nnegras” in Angola derive their name to the growth of a thick stratum of\r\n_Scytonema myochrous_, a blue-green alga, which gradually becomes black\r\nand completely covers the soil. At the close of the rainy season this\r\ngelatinous stratum dries up very slowly, enabling the underlying soil\r\nto retain its moisture for a longer period than would otherwise be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe gelatinous soil algæ are probably very important in this respect,\r\nfor their slow rate of loss of water is coupled with a capacity for\r\nrapid absorption, and they are therefore able to take full advantage of\r\nthe dew that may be deposited upon them and increase the power of the\r\nsoil to retain moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. RELATION OF ALGÆ TO GASEOUS INTERCHANGES IN THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of rice the algæ of the paddy field have been found\r\nto be of extreme importance. Brizi in Italy has shown that although\r\nrice is grown under swamp conditions yet the roots of the rice plant\r\nare typical of those of ordinary terrestrial plants and have none\r\nof the structural adaptations to aquatic life so characteristic of\r\nordinary marsh plants. Hence the plants are entirely dependent for\r\nhealthy growth upon an adequate supply of oxygen to their roots from\r\nthe medium in which they are growing. A serious disease of the rice\r\nplant, characterised by the browning and dying off of the leaves,\r\nwhich was thought at first to be due to the attacks of fungi, was\r\nfound to be the effect of the inadequate aeration of the roots, while\r\nthe entry of the fungi was shown to be subsequent to the appearance\r\nof the physiological disease. The presence of algæ in the swamp water\r\nwas found to prevent the appearance of this disease, in that they\r\nunite with other organisms to form a more or less continuous stratum\r\nover the surface of the ground, and add to the gases which accumulate\r\nthere large quantities of oxygen evolved during photosynthesis. The\r\nconcentration of dissolved oxygen in the water percolating through the\r\nsoil is thereby raised to a maximum, and the healthy growth of the crop\r\nensured.\r\n\r\nThis work has been corroborated by Harrison and Aiyer in India, and a\r\nsufficient supply of algæ in the swamp water is now regarded as one of\r\nthe essentials for the production of a good rice crop.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it appears that, although our knowledge of\r\nthe soil algæ is extremely limited, and our conception of the part\r\nthey play is largely based on speculation, yet the subject is one of\r\nenormous interest and worthy of investigation in many directions. In\r\nits present undeveloped state, it is a little difficult to foresee\r\nwhich lines of study are likely to prove most profitable, but there\r\nis little doubt that eventually the soil algæ will be shown to play a\r\nsignificant part in the economy of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n* _Papers giving extensive bibliographies._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Jewson,\r\n  M.Sc., for permission to include unpublished data from our\r\n  investigations on the soil fungi.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Adametz,[1] investigating the biochemical changes occurring\r\nin soils, isolated several species of fungi. It was, however, only\r\nwith the work of Oudemans and Koning,[17] in 1902 when forty-five\r\nspecies were isolated and described, the majority as new to science,\r\nthat the real study of the fungus flora of the soil commenced. There\r\nis now no doubt that fungi form a large and very important section\r\nof the permanent soil population, and certain forms are found only\r\nin the soil. Indeed, Takahashi[22] has reversed the earlier ideas by\r\nsuggesting that fungus spores in the air are derived from soil forms.\r\nThe majority of investigations on this subject fall, perhaps, into\r\none or more of three classes: (_a_) purely systematic studies such as\r\nthose of Oudemans and Koning,[17] Dale,[5] Jensen,[9] Waksman,[25a]\r\nHagem,[8c] Lendner,[12] and others, which consist in the isolation\r\nand identification of species from various soils: (_b_) physiological\r\nresearches, such as those of Hagem[8c] on the Mucorineæ of Norway, or\r\nthe many investigations on the biochemical changes in soils produced by\r\nfungi, such as those of Muntz and Coudon,[15] McLean and Wilson,[15]\r\nKopeloff,[11] Goddard,[7] McBeth and Scales,[14] and others: (_c_)\r\nquantitative studies, such as those of Remy,[20] Fischer,[6]\r\nRamann,[18] Waksman,[25c] and Takahashi,[22] which involve numerical\r\nestimates of the fungus flora in soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITATIVE STUDY.\r\n\r\nWith very rare exceptions soil fungi cannot be examined in situ, and\r\nthe necessary basis of any qualitative research is the isolation of\r\nthe organisms in pure culture. Most soil forms belong to the _Fungi\r\nimperfecti_, and often show considerable plasticity on artificial\r\nmedia. This makes it very difficult to determine them by comparison\r\nwith type herbarium specimens or published morphological diagnoses.\r\nIn consequence many soil fungi have not infrequently been given new\r\nspecific names, as _humicola_, _terricola_, and so forth, which is\r\nvery unsatisfactory, and means that the determinations have little\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, most artificial media are slight variations on a few\r\ncommon and simple themes, and are very selective, permitting the growth\r\nof a moiety only of the fungi present. In addition, many fungi grow\r\nso slowly that they are overwhelmed by the more rapidly germinating\r\nor spreading forms, or on the other hand, they may be eliminated by\r\nthe metabolic products of different adjacent colonies. The extremely\r\nselective nature of the technique commonly used is shown if one\r\ntabulates systematically all the fungi which have been recorded or\r\ndescribed in soil investigations. Of _Phycomycetes_ there are fifty-six\r\nspecies of eleven genera; of _Ascomycetes_ twelve species of eight\r\ngenera; and of _Fungi imperfecti_, including _Actinomycetes_ but not\r\nsterile _Mycelia_, 197 species of sixty-two genera. Rusts and Smuts\r\none might not expect, but that of the multitudes of _Basidiomycetes_\r\ngrowing in wood and meadow not one should have been recorded is indeed\r\nstartling. It was at first thought that many imperfect fungi might\r\nbe conidial stages of _Basidiomycetes_, but much search among forms\r\nisolated at Rothamsted has, up to the present, failed to reveal clamp\r\nconnections in the hyphæ.\r\n\r\nSince various species of soil fungi have different optimum temperature,\r\nhumidity and other conditions[3] one would not expect to find an even\r\ngeographic distribution. Very little is yet known of this aspect, but\r\n_Rhizopus nigricans_, _Mucor racemosus_, _Zygorrhynchus vuilleminii_,\r\n_Aspergillus niger_, _Trichoderma koningi_, _Cladosporium herbarum_,\r\nand many species of _Aspergillus_, _Penicillium_, _Fusarium_,\r\n_Alternaria_, and _Cephalosporium_ have been commonly found throughout\r\nNorth America and Europe wherever soils have been examined. Species of\r\n_Aspergillus_, however, would appear to be more common in the soils\r\nof south temperate regions and species of _Penicillium_, _Mucor_,\r\n_Trichoderma_, and _Fusarium_ more abundant in northern soils.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in many plant and animal communities there\r\noccurs a definite rhythm, various species following each other in a\r\nregular sequence as dominants in the population. Although it is not yet\r\npossible to make any definite statement there would seem indications\r\nthat this may also be true of the soil fungi.\r\n\r\nMuch work has been done on the distribution of species at different\r\ndepths in the soil, but the results are still confusing. Thus,\r\nexamining eighteen species, Goddard[7] found no difference in relative\r\ndistribution down to 5½ inches. Werkenthin[26] found identical species\r\nfrom 1-4 inches, and then an absence of fungi from 5-7 inches, which\r\nlatter was the greatest depth he examined. Waksman[25] found little\r\ndifference in the first six inches, but very few species below 8 inches\r\nexcept _Zygorrhynchus vuilleminii_, which extended down to 30 inches\r\nand was often the only species occurring below 12 inches. Taylor[23]\r\nhas reported species of _Fusarium_ at practically every depth to 24\r\ninches. Rathbun[19] found _Aspergillus niger_, _Rhizopus nigricans_,\r\nand species of Fusarium and Mucor down to 34 inches, and _Oospora\r\nlactis_, _Trichoderma koningi_, _Zygorrhynchus vuilleminii_ and species\r\nof _Penicillium_, _Spicaria_ and _Saccharomyces_ as deep as 44 inches.\r\nEleven species were isolated from the alimentary canal of grubs and\r\nworms, and Rathbun concluded that soil fungi may be spread by these\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nOn an unmanured grass plot at Rothamsted twenty species were isolated\r\nfrom a depth of 1 inch, nineteen from 6 inches, and eleven from\r\n12 inches, whereas on the unmanured plot of Broadbalk wheat field\r\ntwenty-six species were obtained from 1 inch, seven from 6 inches, and\r\nfive from 12 inches. There appeared to be no conspicuous differences\r\nbetween the floras of the two plots save that in the Broadbalk plot\r\nthere were fewer Mucorales, and _Zygorrhynchus mœlleri_ and _Absidia\r\ncylindrospora_ were absent. In the grass plot samples about one-half\r\nthe forms occurring at the lower levels were isolated also from the\r\nupper levels, but in the Broadbalk sample the five forms isolated from\r\n12 inches, and five out of seven of those at 6 inches occurred only at\r\nthose levels, i.e. each of the three levels appeared to have a specific\r\nflora. The difference in depth distribution in these two cases may\r\nbe due to the fact that in the Broadbalk plot the stiff clay subsoil\r\noccurs at 5-7 inches, whereas in the grass plot the depth of soil is\r\ngreater than 12 inches. Much further work needs to be done on this\r\naspect before any definite conclusion can be reached.\r\n\r\nMuch scattered information is available concerning the effect of\r\nsoil type, manuring, treatment, cropping, and so forth upon the\r\nfungus content, but no clear issue as yet emerges from the results.\r\nHagem[8] found that cultivated soils vary greatly from forest soils\r\nin the species of _Mucor_ present, and that certain species seem\r\nto be associated in similar environments. Thus in pinewoods _Mucor\r\nramannianus_ is usually found, together with _M. strictus_, _M.\r\nflavus_, and _M. sylvaticus_, and with this “_M. Ramannianus Society_,”\r\n_M. racemosus_, _M. hiemalis_, and _Absidia orchidis_, are frequently\r\nassociated. The differences found by Hagem between the species of\r\n_Mucor_ from forest and cultivated land could not, however, be\r\nconfirmed by Werkenthin.[26]\r\n\r\nDale,[5] examining sandy, chalky, peaty and black earth soils, found\r\nspecific differences, although many of the species were common to all.\r\nA soil which had been manured continuously for thirty-eight years\r\nwith ammonium sulphate alone, contained twenty-two species, whereas\r\nthe same soil with the addition of lime only had thirteen species.\r\nBoth Goddard[7] and Werkenthin,[26] in their investigations, found\r\na constant and characteristic fungus flora regardless of soil type,\r\ntillage, or manuring. Waksman’s[25] studies of forest soils showed\r\nfew species of _Mucor_ but many of _Penicillium_ and _Trichoderma_[2];\r\norchard soil contained no species of _Trichoderma_, very few of\r\n_Penicillium_, but a large number of species of _Mucor_; species of\r\n_Trichoderma_ were common in acid soils, whilst cultivated garden\r\nsoil contained all forms. The examination of very differently manured\r\nplots on the Broadbalk wheat field at Rothamsted has not shown any\r\nstriking differences in the fungus flora, all the more important groups\r\nof species being represented in every plot, but significant minor\r\ndifferences are present. Thus, plot 13, manured with double ammonium\r\nsalts, superphosphate and sulphate of potash, is especially rich in\r\n“species” of Trichoderma, whereas the unmanured plot contains large\r\nnumbers of species of green _Penicillium_, _Trichoderma_, and a species\r\nof _Botrytis_ (pyramidalis?).\r\n\r\nThe effect of the crop upon the fungus flora is seen in cases where\r\nthe same crop is grown year after year as in certain flax areas, where\r\nspecies of _Fusarium_ accumulate in the soil and tend to produce “flax\r\nsickness.”[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITATIVE STUDY.\r\n\r\nAs it is not possible to count the soil fungi _in situ_, any estimation\r\nof the numbers present in a soil must be arrived at by indirect means.\r\nThe method adopted is to make as fine a suspension as possible of\r\na known quantity of soil sample in a known amount of water, dilute\r\nthis to 1/5000, 1/10000, and so forth by regular gradations, incubate\r\ncubic centimetres of the final dilution on artificial media in petri\r\ndishes, and count the colonies of fungi developing in each plate.\r\nUsing the average figures from a series of duplicate plates, the\r\nnumber of “individual” fungi in a gram of the original soil sample may\r\nthen be calculated. The very few students who have made quantitative\r\nestimations have obtained very unsatisfactory results. In bacterial or\r\nprotozoal estimations, the shaking of the soil suspension separates the\r\nunicellular individuals, so that in the final platings each individual\r\nfrom the soil theoretically gives rise to one colony on the medium.\r\nIn the case of fungi, the organisms may be in the form of unicellular\r\nor multicellular spores or larger or smaller masses of unicellular or\r\nmulticellular mycelium differing for each particular species or phase\r\nof development within the single species. The organisms may be sterile\r\nin the soil or form fruiting bodies, consisting of few or myriads\r\nof locally or widely distributed spores. In the process of shaking\r\nthe soil-suspension fungi of different organisation or of differing\r\ndevelopmental stages may be broken up and moieties fragmented in\r\ntotally different ways or to very different degrees. With protozoa and\r\nbacteria the relation of soil individual to plate colony is direct;\r\nwith fungi we do not know what is the soil “individual” nor whether it\r\nis the same for different fungi; nor can we yet profitably discuss any\r\nsignificant numerical relationship of plate colonies to soil organisms.\r\nThus Conn[4] has pointed out that the plate count of a fungus indicates\r\nonly the ability to produce reproductive bodies and found that the\r\nspores of one colony of _Aspergillus_, if distributed evenly through\r\na kilogram of soil, could produce the average plate counts obtained\r\nby Waksman. Abundant vegetative growth may, in some species, reduce\r\nor inhibit spore formation, so that of two species the one giving a\r\nlower count might really be much the more important and plentiful\r\nin the soil. Further, the colonies developing in the final plates\r\nrepresent only a selected few of the fungi present in the soil sample,\r\nthe _Basidiomycetes_, and no doubt many other forms, being absent.\r\nIn addition, different media differ among themselves in the average\r\nnumber of colonies developing on the plates, each medium giving,\r\nas it were, its own point of view. Thus, in one experiment carried\r\nout at Rothamsted by Miss Jewson, using the same soil suspension,\r\ntwenty plates of Coon’s Agar gave 357 colonies, of Cook’s Agar 246,\r\nof Czapek’s Agar 215, and of Prune Agar 366. Thus if one only used\r\nCoon’s Agar and Prune Agar one would obtain a total of 723 colonies,\r\nwhereas the same suspension on Cook’s Agar and Czapek’s Agar would\r\ngive only 461, and the calculated numbers of fungi per gram of soil\r\nwould be totally different. Further, if a single medium be taken, it\r\nis found that slight alterations in the degree of acidity may make\r\nvery considerable differences in the final numbers. Thus Coon’s Agar\r\nacidified to a hydrogen ion concentration of 5·0 gave as the results of\r\nfour series the following average numbers of colonies per plate, 17,\r\n23·75, 18, 23. When, however, the medium was acidified to a PH of 4·0\r\nto 4·3, corresponding averages from three series were 38, 46·3, and\r\n44·8; i.e. the final estimations of numbers of fungi in the soil was\r\nabout twice as great. Again, the degree of dilution of soil suspension\r\nused in plating may also be a very serious factor. Thus, if a series of\r\ndilutions be made of 1/80,000, 1/40,000, 1/20,000, 1/10,000, 1/5,000\r\nand 1/2,500, the average plate numbers should be in the proportions\r\nof 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 respectively. In an actual experiment, the\r\nfollowing average plate numbers were obtained, 15·4, 32·8, 59·1, 104·0,\r\n150, 224·5, which show a very decided reduction in the higher numbers.\r\nIf, however, dilutions of a suspension of spores of a single species be\r\nmade, this reduction does not occur.\r\n\r\nThese are but three of the very numerous factors involved in the\r\ntechnique of quantitative estimation, and every single factor may be\r\nthe source of errors of similar magnitude, minute fluctuations in the\r\noperations leading to the final platings having very considerable\r\neffect upon the numbers of colonies that develop.\r\n\r\nBy critically evaluating each particular factor in the method, and\r\nmaking statistical correction, it has, however, been found possible to\r\nobtain series of duplicate plates comparing very favourably and thus to\r\nextract certain figures which, whilst not possessing any final value,\r\nhave yet a certain general and comparative worth. Thus, 20·0, 18·2,\r\nand 16·8 were obtained as the averages of six plates each, of a soil\r\nsuspension divided into three parts, and the individual plate numbers\r\nin all three series were within the range of normal distribution. The\r\nmeaning of these numerical estimates in relation to fungi per gram\r\nof soil sample is, however, entirely hypothetical, and to have value\r\nquantitative comparison should only be made between single species\r\nor groups of species closely related physiologically, and where the\r\ntechnique is standardised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Monthly Counts of Numbers of Fungi per gramme\r\nof Dry Soil.

There are, however, certain figures\r\nwhich show that decided seasonal differences exist. Thus, correcting\r\nand averaging certain of Waksman’s results[25] the following numbers\r\nof fungi per gram of soil at 4 inches deep are obtained; September,\r\n768,000; October, 522,000; November, 310,000; January, 182,000. At\r\nRothamsted results have been obtained which would appear to mark\r\na clear seasonal rhythm, corresponding in the time of its maxima\r\nin Autumn and Spring with the periodicities known for many other\r\necological communities (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nThe numbers of fungi at various depths in the soil show very clearly\r\nmarked differences. The distribution in the top 4-6 inches depending\r\nprobably upon the depth of soil, is more or less equal, but there is a\r\nvery rapid falling off in numbers, especially between 5-9 inches, until\r\nat 20-30 inches fungi are either very few in number or absent. Thus\r\nTakahashi[22] found 590,000 fungi per gram at a depth of 2 cms. and\r\nonly 160,000 at 8 cms.\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII.--INFLUENCE OF SOIL TREATMENT UPON THE NUMBERS OF FUNGI AS\r\nDETERMINED BY THE PLATE METHOD--(AFTER WAKSMAN).\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+\r\n  |                          |         |Numbers of Fungi |\r\n  |   Soil Fertilisation.    |Reaction.|per Gram of Soil.|\r\n  +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+\r\n  |                          |   P.H.  |                 |\r\n  |Minerals only             |   5·6   |     37,300      |\r\n  |Heavily manured           |   5·8   |     73,000      |\r\n  |Sodium nitrate            |   5·8   |     46,000      |\r\n  |Ammonium sulphate         |   4·0   |    110,000      |\r\n  |Minerals and lime         |   6·6   |     26,200      |\r\n  |Ammonium sulphate and lime|   6·2   |     39,100      |\r\n  +--------------------------+---------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nThe type of soil and its treatment exercise a great influence over\r\nthe number of fungi present. Fischer[6] found that farmyard manure\r\nincreased the number of fungi in uncultivated “Hochmoor,” cultivated\r\n“Grunlandmoor,” and a clay soil by two, three, and five times\r\nrespectively. Waksman’s results[25] indicate that the more fertile\r\nsoils contain more fungi, both in number and species, than the less\r\nfertile ones, and if one averages his results, the following figures\r\nare obtained: garden soil, 525,000 per gram; orchard soil, 250,000;\r\nmeadow soil, 750,000; and forest soil, 151,000. Recently Waksman[25_e_]\r\nhas found that manure and acid fertilisers increase the numbers of\r\nfungi in the soil, whereas the addition of lime decreases them (Table\r\nXIII.).\r\n\r\nJones and Murdock[10] examined surface and sub-surface samples of\r\nforty-six soils representing seventeen soil types in eastern Ontario.\r\nMolds were fairly uniform in numbers in all soils except a sandy clay\r\nloam and sandy clay shale, in which they were absent.\r\n\r\nIt has also frequently been pointed out that acid and water-logged\r\nsoils are richer in fungus content than normal agricultural soils.\r\nOn the other hand, Brown and Halversen[2] found, examining six plots\r\nreceiving different treatment and studied through a complete year, that\r\nthe numbers of fungi were unaffected by moisture, temperature, or soil\r\ntreatment. Against this, however, must be set the work of Coleman[3]\r\nwho studied the activities of fungi in sterile soils and found such\r\nfactors as temperature, aeration and food supply to exercise a deciding\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nInvestigations at Rothamsted show that Broadbalk plot 13, receiving\r\ndouble ammonium salts, superphosphate and sulphate of potash and\r\nyielding 31 bushels per acre, and plot 2, receiving farmyard manure and\r\nyielding 35·2 bushels, contain approximately equal numbers of fungi.\r\nThis figure is about half as high again as that for plot 3, which\r\nis unmanured and yields 12·6 bushels, plot 10, with double ammonium\r\nsalts alone and yielding 20 bushels, and plot 11, with double ammonium\r\nsalts and superphosphate and yielding 22·9 bushels per acre. A primary\r\nfactor, however, in all considerations such as these is the equality\r\nof distribution of fungi laterally in any particular soil. There are\r\nprobably few soils so homogeneous as the Broadbalk plots at Rothamsted,\r\nand on plot 2 (farmyard manure since 1852) samples taken from the lower\r\nand upper ends and the middle region gave average numbers of colonies\r\nper plate of 24, 23, and 25 respectively. On the other hand, soil\r\nsamples taken only a few yards apart in the middle region of the plot\r\ngave average plate counts of 33·7 and 56·8.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nSurveying generally the field covered in this chapter, one can only\r\nbe impressed with the fragmentary character of our knowledge and with\r\nthe fact that, owing to the selective nature of the technique, the\r\ndata we possess, if assumed to be representative, give an entirely\r\npartial and erroneous picture of the soil fungi. From the qualitative\r\naspect, the chief impediment is the impossibility of obtaining reliable\r\nspecific determinations of very many of the soil fungi. Lists of\r\ndoubtfully-named forms from particular soils or geographic regions\r\nare useless or a positive evil, and there is imperative need for the\r\nsystematising of selected genera by physiological criteria, such as has\r\nbeen partially done for _Penicillium_, _Fusarium_, and _Aspergillus_.\r\nFurthermore, until a standardised and non-selective technique has been\r\ndevised, or a number of standardised selective methods for particular\r\ngroups, comparative investigations into specific distribution can\r\ngive little of value. This latter criticism is also very applicable\r\nif regard be paid to the quantitative aspect of soil work, for\r\nprogress here largely depends upon the elaboration of a standardised\r\nfractionation technique. Every single factor in these methods needs\r\nexact analysis, for each gives opportunity for great error, and each\r\nerror is magnified many thousand times in the final results. Much\r\nhas been done in this direction at Rothamsted, but more remains to\r\ndo. Finally, working with single species in sterilised soil under\r\nstandardised conditions, there is fundamental work to be done on the\r\nrelation of plate colony to soil “individual.”\r\n\r\n  [1] Adametz, I., “Untersuchungen über die niederen Pilze der\r\n  Ackerkrume,” Inaug.

Unless, however, they are regarded\r\nmerely as inert spore contaminations from the air, a view which is\r\nnow no longer tenable, their very presence implies the existence\r\nof innumerable vital relationships between the organisms and their\r\nenvironment. From this point of view the studies treated in the\r\nprevious chapter are but the necessary first steps to an understanding\r\nof the relation of soil fungi to living plants and of the part played\r\nby them in the soil economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF SOIL FUNGI TO LIVING PLANTS.\r\n\r\nOlder classifications of fungi frequently divided these organisms\r\ninto four categories--parasites, saprophytes, facultative parasites,\r\nand facultative saprophytes, but the further mycological studies are\r\ncarried the more clearly it is seen that these groups are entirely\r\nartificial. There are probably few fungi that cannot, under particular\r\nconditions, invade living tissues, and it only seems a question of\r\ntime before at all events the vast majority of fungi will be grown on\r\nsynthetic media in the laboratory. From our present point of view the\r\nimportance of this lies in the fact that fungi living saprophytically\r\nin the soil may, given the right conditions or the presence of some\r\nparticular host plant, become parasites or symbionts, and conversely\r\nwell-known pathogens may live a saprophytic existence. Thus Cucumber\r\nLeaf Spot is caused by _Colletotrichum oligochætum_, and Bewley[3] has\r\nrepeatedly isolated this fungus from glasshouse manure and refuse of\r\nvarious kinds. In his early studies, Butler[13] isolated many parasitic\r\nspecies of _Pythium_ from Indian soils, and the presence of _P. de\r\nBaryanum_ as a soil saprophyte has been confirmed by Bussey, Peters,\r\nand Ulrich.[11] De Bruyn[17] has recently found that most species of\r\n_Phytophthora_, including _P. erythroseptica_ and _P. infestans_ may\r\nlive as saprophytes in the soil, whilst Pratt[53] has isolated from\r\nvirgin lands and desert soils various fungi, which cause disease in\r\npotatoes. In 1912 Jensen[29] gave a list of twenty-three “facultative\r\nparasites” isolated from soil, and these are but a moiety of those\r\nwhich could be listed to-day.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was shown by Frank[24] many decades ago that forest\r\nhumus is not merely a mass of the remains of animals and plants,\r\nbut that a considerable part of its organic substance is made up of\r\nfungus hyphæ, which ramify and penetrate in all directions. Evidence\r\nis rapidly accumulating that this is also true of most other soils\r\ncontaining organic matter. It is well known that many of the higher\r\nplants live in symbiotic or commensal relationship with these humus\r\nfungi, which are present in the host tissues as mycorrhiza, and further\r\nstudies only serve to show the widespread and fundamental nature\r\nof this relationship. Thus many _Basidiomycetes_[50] (species of\r\n_Tricholoma_, _Russula_, _Cortinarius_, _Boletus_, _Elaphomyces_, etc.)\r\npossess a mycorrhizal relationship with various broad leaved trees,\r\nsuch as beech, hazel, and birch[57] and with various conifers and\r\ncertain Ericales. Other Ericales show this relationship with species of\r\nthe genus _Phoma_,[62] many orchids, with species of _Rhizoctonia_[2]\r\n(or _Orcheomyces_[10]), whilst _Gastrodia elata_ contains _Armillaria\r\nmellea_.[36] Certain species of _Pteridophyta_ and _Bryophyta_ are\r\nalso known to certain mycorrhizal fungi. Of the numerous fungi taking\r\npart in these mycorrhizal relationships, only a small number have yet\r\nbeen identified, but there is little doubt that perhaps the majority\r\nof these organisms must be regarded as true soil forms.[14],[45] The\r\nmycological flora of the soil thus plays an important part in the life\r\nof many higher forms of vegetation, and this relationship is a very\r\nfruitful field for study.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION OF FUNGI TO SOIL PROCESSES.\r\n\r\nThe great cycle of changes occurring in the soil whereby organic matter\r\nis gradually transformed and again made available as plant food is\r\nentirely dependent upon micro-organisms. Until a decade ago it was\r\nthought that bacteria were by far the most important group concerned\r\nin the bringing about of these changes, but recent studies have shown\r\nthat, in at all events certain arcs of this great organic cycle,\r\nthe fungi have, perhaps, an equal part to play. The life of fungi\r\nin the soil may, for our purposes, be considered from three points\r\nof view--their part in the decomposition of carbon compounds, their\r\nnitrogen relationships, and their work in the mineral transformations\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBON RELATIONSHIPS.\r\n\r\nOf primary importance in the carbon relationships of soil fungi is\r\nthe part played in the decomposition of the celluloses, which compose\r\nalmost all the structural remains of plant tissues. Our first real\r\nknowledge of this subject was given by Van Iterson[28] in 1904 when he\r\nshowed the wide extent of cellulose destruction by fungi, and devised\r\nmethods whereby fifteen cellulose-decomposing forms, many of which have\r\nsince proved to be common soil fungi, were isolated. Three years later\r\nAppel[1] published his account of the genus _Fusarium_, and showed\r\nthat many of the species could destroy filter paper. A difficulty was\r\nintroduced in 1908 by Schellenberg,[60] who, working with common soil\r\nforms, found that only hemicelluloses and not pure cellulose were\r\ndestroyed. This has recently been supported by Otto,[48] but from the\r\npractical point of view the discussion is academic for the amount of\r\npure cellulose in plants is insignificant.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 McBeth and Scales[43] showed that a considerable number\r\nof common soil fungi were most active cellulose destroyers, pure\r\nprecipitated cellulose and cotton being readily attacked. This was\r\nsupported by McBeth in 1916,[42] whilst Scales[59] has found that\r\nmost species of _Penicillium_ and _Aspergillus_ decompose cellulose,\r\nespecially where ammonium sulphate is the source of nitrogen.\r\nWaksman[65] tested twenty-two soil fungi and found that eleven\r\ndecomposed cellulose rapidly and four slowly, whilst Dascewska,[16]\r\nWaksman,[66],[67] and others have concluded that soil fungi play\r\na more important part in the decomposition of cellulose and in\r\n“humification” than soil bacteria. Schmitz[61] has recently shown that\r\ncellulose-destroying bacteria play no important part in the decay of\r\nwood under natural conditions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the celluloses, practically all simple and complex\r\norganic carbon compounds are attacked by soil fungi, and in many cases\r\nthe decomposition is very rapid.[26] Many _Actinomycetes_, _Aspergilli_\r\nand _Penicillia_ are active starch splitters, and it is of interest to\r\nnote that some of the strongest cellulose decomposers (_Melanconium\r\nsp._, _Trichoderma sp._, and _Fusaria_) secrete little diastase.[66]\r\nThe _Mucorales_ apparently do not attack cellulose, but can only\r\nutilise pectin bodies, monosaccharides, and partly disaccharides.[26]\r\nDox and Neidig[19] have shown that various species of _Aspergillus_\r\nand _Penicillium_ are able to attack the soil pentosans. Roussy,[58]\r\nKohshi,[24] Verkade and Söhngen,[64] and many other workers have found\r\nthat fats and fatty acids are readily used as food by soil fungi, and\r\nKoch and Oelsner[33] have recently shown that tannins are readily\r\nassimilated. Klöcker,[32] Ritter,[56] and others have shown that the\r\nutilisation of many carbon compounds is to a large extent determined by\r\nthe source of nitrogen and its concentration in the pabulum.\r\n\r\nThere would seem, therefore, no doubt that the decomposition of\r\ncelluloses and other carbon compounds is of primary importance in the\r\nlife-activities of soil fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN RELATIONSHIPS.\r\n\r\nIn this section we shall consider the problems of nitrogen fixation and\r\nnitrification, of ammonification, and of the utilisation of nitrogenous\r\ncompounds by soil fungi.\r\n\r\nAs soil fungi form so large a part of the soil population, the question\r\nof whether they can make use of the free nitrogen of the air is of\r\nprimary importance. During the last two decades many investigators have\r\nattempted to solve the problem, often studying allied or identical\r\nspecies; but if one consults some thirty researches published during\r\nthis period, opinion is found to be about equally divided. Even,\r\nhowever, in those studies where nitrogen fixation has been recorded the\r\namounts are very slight, usually being below 5 mgrms. per 50 c.c. of\r\nsolution, and often being obviously within the limits of experimental\r\nerror. Latham,[37] however, working on _Aspergillus niger_, recorded\r\nvariations ranging from a nitrogen loss of 42·5 mgrms. to a nitrogen\r\nfixation of 205·1 mgrms. per 50 c.c. of medium. Ternetz[63] found\r\nthat different strains of _Phoma radicis_ may fix from 2·5 mgrms. of\r\nnitrogen in the lowest case, to 15·7 mgrms. in the highest per 50 c.c.\r\nof nutrient solution. Duggar and Davis[20] report that _Phoma betæ_\r\nmay fix nitrogen in quantities of 7·75 mgrms. per 50 c.c. of medium.\r\nThe latter authors, in a very able critique of the problem, indicate\r\ncertain possible sources of error in previous work, and if one examines\r\nthe studies in which nitrogen fixation has been recorded in the light\r\nof these criticisms, it is difficult not to think that, with the\r\nexception of the genus _Phoma_, good evidence for nitrogen fixation\r\nby fungi is lacking. _Phoma betæ_ is a common pathogen attacking\r\nbeets, whilst _P. radicis_ is a mycorrhizal form inhabiting various\r\nEricales. Apart from these exact quantitative studies, which have\r\ngiven a negative verdict, there is a considerable amount of positive\r\nbut indirect evidence for nitrogen fixation by mycorrhizal fungi,[55]\r\nand it is very unfortunate that more of these forms have not been\r\ninvestigated quantitatively. As the evidence stands to-day, one must\r\nconclude that the fungus flora does not play any part in the direct\r\nnitrogen enrichment of the soil.\r\n\r\nEqually obscure is the question of nitrification and denitrification\r\nby soil fungi, but this is the result of a lack of study rather than\r\nof a plethora of indeterminate researches. Direct nitrification or\r\ndenitrification has not been established, but the work of Laurent[38]\r\nand a few other workers appears to show that soil fungi can reduce\r\nnitrates to nitrites.\r\n\r\nThe second primary nitrogen relationship that we have to consider is\r\nthe process of ammonification. The ammonifying power of soil fungi was\r\nfirst demonstrated by Muntz and Coudon,[46] and by Marchal[40] in 1893,\r\nthe former showing that _Mucor racemosus_ and _Fusarium Muntzii_ gave a\r\nlarger accumulation of ammonia in soil than any of the bacteria tested;\r\nand the latter that _Aspergillus terricola_, _Cephalothecium roseum_\r\nand other soil fungi were active ammonifiers, especially in acid\r\nsoils. Shibata,[62] Perotti,[49] Hagem,[26] Kappen,[31] Löhnis,[39]\r\nand others, have observed that urea, dicyanamide and cyanamide are\r\ndecomposed with the liberation of ammonia; and Hagem[26] has recorded\r\nthe same process for peptones, amino acids, and other organic nitrogen\r\ncompounds in plant and animal remains in the soil. The latter author\r\nconsiders soil fungi more important ammonifying agents in the soil than\r\nbacteria, a conclusion in which McLean and Wilson,[44] and perhaps most\r\nlater workers concur. McLean and Wilson[44] found large differences in\r\nthe ammonifying powers of various soil fungi, the _Moniliaceæ_ being\r\nthe strongest ammonifiers, the _Aspergillaceæ_ the weakest. Generic and\r\nspecific differences have been confirmed by Coleman,[15] Waksman,[67]\r\nand other authors. Waksman and Cook[70] suggested that such variations\r\nmay be due, not to innate differences in the metabolic activities of\r\nthe several organisms, but to differences in reproductive times, and\r\nthat there might be some relationship between sporogeny and the ability\r\nto accumulate nitrogen. Kopeloff[35] has carried out experiments on\r\nthe inoculation of sterilised soil with known quantities of spores\r\nand found that, although the amount of ammonia accumulated increased\r\nwith the number of spores the proportion was not direct but modified\r\nby the food supply. After the first five days’ growth, the rate of\r\nammonia production varied markedly in a two-day rhythm which seemed\r\nto be due to the metabolism of the fungus rather than to recurrent\r\nstages of spore formation and germination in the life history. The\r\namount of ammonia liberated has been shown by recent work[66] to depend\r\nupon the available sources of carbon and nitrogen. In the absence of\r\na carbohydrate supply the protein is attacked both for carbon and\r\nnitrogen, and since more of the former is required much ammonia is\r\nliberated. In addition, however, to the carbon and nitrogen control,\r\nthe process of ammonification by soil fungi is intimately related to\r\nphysical conditions. Working with pure cultures, McLean and Wilson,[44]\r\nColeman,[15] Kopeloff,[35] Waksman and Cook,[70] and other students,\r\nhave shown that the amount of ammonia accumulated depends upon such\r\nfactors as the presence of phosphates, the period of incubation of the\r\nfungi, aeration, the moisture in the soil, the temperature, the degree\r\nof soil acidity, the type of soil, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThat fungi take a very important place as ammonifying agents in the\r\nsoil can no longer be doubted, but the question yet remains to be\r\nconsidered of the balance of profit or loss resulting from their\r\nactivities. It has usually been considered that a part of the ammonia\r\nfreed is used by the fungi themselves, but that the greater part\r\nis liberated, and so rendered available to nitrifying organisms.\r\nBoth Neller[47] and Potter and Snyder[51] found that typical soil\r\nfungi inoculated into sterile soil grew with a vigour approximately\r\nequal to the growth induced by an inoculation of the entire soil\r\nflora. This is largely to be accounted for by the fact that when\r\nsoils are sterilised by heat or by certain chemicals, breaking-down\r\nchanges occur, and substances are liberated which are peculiarly\r\nfavourable to fungus growth. This fact must be borne in mind when\r\ninterpreting ammonification and other studies where the method is that\r\nof inoculation of fungi into sterilised soil. In many cases it tends\r\nto nullify any application of the results to normal soils, whilst in\r\nothers the conclusions must be accepted with some reserve. In all\r\ncases Potter and Snyder[51] found that fungi caused a diminution in\r\nthe amount of nitrates, that the ammonia was not much changed in\r\namount, and that there was a decrease in the quantities of soluble\r\nnon-protein nitrogen. The range of organic and inorganic nitrogenous\r\ncompounds utilisable by soil fungi is very great. Ritter[56] has shown\r\nthat certain forms can use the nitrogen of “free” nitric acid in the\r\nmedium; Ritter,[56] Hagem,[26] and others, that soil fungi can use\r\nammonia nitrogen equally with nitrate nitrogen, and Ehrenberg[21]\r\nconcluded that soil fungi play a more important part in the building\r\nof albuminoids from ammonia than bacteria do. Ehrlich[22] has shown\r\nthat various heterocyclic nitrogen compounds and alkaloids can serve as\r\nsources of nitrogen to soil fungi, whilst Ehrlich and Jacobsen[23] have\r\nfound that soil fungi can form oxy-acids from amino-acids. Hagem,[26]\r\nPovah,[52] Bokorny,[6],[8] and others, state that for many soil forms\r\norganic nitrogen sources are better than inorganic sources, and that\r\npeptones, amino-acids, urea, and uric acids, etc., are very quickly\r\nutilised by species of _Mucor_, yeasts, and so forth. Butkevitch,[12]\r\nand Dox[18] have recently found that it depends on circumstances which\r\ncompounds of protein molecule can be utilised by particular fungi, and\r\nthat soil fungi can utilise both amino and amido complexes for the\r\nformation of ammonia. In 1919 Boas[4] showed for _Aspergillus niger_\r\nthat if a number of nitrogenous compounds are available the fungus\r\nabsorbs the most highly dissociated.\r\n\r\nIn the welter of scattered observations on the utilisation of\r\nnitrogenous compounds, it is difficult to trace any clear issue. That\r\nproteins, amino-acids, and other complex organic compounds are readily\r\nbroken down to ammonia by soil fungi is clear, and, on the other hand,\r\nit is also clear that soil fungi utilise extensively ammonia and\r\nnitrates as sources of nitrogen. On which side the balance lies it is\r\nyet impossible to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL RELATIONSHIPS.\r\n\r\nHeinze[27] and Hagem[26] have stated that soil fungi make the insoluble\r\ncalcium, phosphorus, and magnesium compounds in soil soluble and\r\navailable for plant food; and Butkevitch[12] has used _Aspergillus\r\nniger_ in determining the availability of the mineral constituents,\r\nbut practically no work has yet been carried out on these problems.\r\nA further matter on which sound evidence is greatly to be desired is\r\nthe part played by soil fungi in the oxidation processes of iron and\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nA point which may be mentioned here, as it is of some considerable\r\npractical importance, is the large quantity of oxalic, citric, and\r\nother acids formed by certain common soil fungi. Acid formation\r\nis partly dependent upon the species of fungus--even more the\r\nphysiological race within the species--and partly upon the substratum,\r\nparticularly the source of carbon.[5],[54] It is interesting that as\r\na group _Actinomycetes_ do not form acids from the carbon source but\r\nalkaline substances from the nitrogen sources.[69]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF SOIL FUNGI.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding sections an attempt has been made to sketch rapidly\r\nthe chief outlines of the widespread relationships of soil fungi and\r\nof the fundamental part that they play in the biochemical changes\r\noccurring in the soil. It will be evident, even from this survey,\r\nthat their occurrence is of the utmost agricultural importance, both\r\nwhen helpful as in mycorrhizal relationships or as agents in making\r\ncomplex organic materials available as plant food, or when harmful\r\nas when causal agents of disease in plants. It is clear that could\r\nthe soil fungi be controlled to human ends by the encouragement of\r\nthe useful forms and the elimination of the harmful, a valuable power\r\nwould be placed in the hands of the grower of plants. Certain aspects\r\nof this control, the cruder and more destructive perhaps, are already\r\npracticable, whilst the finer and more constructive aspects remain\r\npossibilities of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the technique of control is selective in that it aims\r\nto determine one or more particular fungi, leaving the remaining flora\r\nuntouched. Its highest expression is seen, perhaps, in the utilisation\r\nof pure cultures of mycorrhizal fungi for horticultural purposes, such\r\nas orchid cultivation, but there is no reason why this should not be\r\ndone for other purposes on a field scale similar to the way in which\r\ncultures of special strains of the root nodule organisms of legumes\r\nare employed. A second aspect is the direct encouragement of special\r\ncomponents of the fungus flora for particular purposes by selective\r\nfeeding. Thus, in a laboratory experiment, McBeth and Scales[43] record\r\nan increase of 2000 times in cellulose-destroying and other soil fungi\r\nby this method. It has been pointed out that soil fungus activities\r\nsuch as ammonification, proteolysis and carbohydrate decomposition are\r\ncontrolled by factorial equilibria, and for special purposes it would\r\nseem feasible to weight the balance so that particular activities may\r\nbe favoured. A further step in this direction is the controlling of\r\nparticular physical conditions so that the activities of certain fungi\r\nmay be restricted. Professor L. R. Jones[30] and his colleagues at\r\nMadison have shown the primary importance of the control of the soil\r\ntemperature in certain parasitic relationships; the work of Gillespie\r\nand Hurst[25] and later workers has demonstrated that the parasitism\r\nof certain species and strains of _Actinomyces_ upon the potato\r\nis conditioned by definite ranges of soil acidity; and many other\r\nrelationships of similar nature are known. Data along such lines are\r\nrapidly accumulating, and in certain cases are already susceptible of\r\npractical application. In other cases, particular soil fungi are less\r\nopen to persuasive influences, and more drastic treatment needs to be\r\nadopted. Certain chemicals mixed intimately with the soil increase or\r\ndiminish the numbers of particular fungi or groups of fungi; whilst\r\nthese organisms may be totally eliminated from the soil by wet or\r\ndry heat for definite periods or by treatment with potent fungicides\r\nsuch as formaldehyde. Although soil sterilisation and crude treatment\r\nin other ways has been practised for decades, the possibility of a\r\nmore delicate control of soil fungi is only now being realised. Its\r\nconcrete expression will depend upon the progress that is made in exact\r\nknowledge of the activities of soil fungi under natural and controlled\r\nconditions, of the balance of factors in the environment which controls\r\nany particular function and of the genetic nature of the soil fungi\r\nwhich occur. Each of these aspects is a fruitful field of study.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATION TO SOIL FERTILITY.\r\n\r\nFrom a general survey of the researches that have been carried out on\r\nsoil fungi during the past two decades certain issues emerge. It would\r\nseem clear that fungi occupy, perhaps, a primary place as factors in\r\nthe decomposition of celluloses, and thus may be the chief agents in\r\nthe transformation of plant remains to humus and to soluble compounds\r\nwhich can be used as food by the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Furthermore,\r\nsoil fungi are very important ammonifiers, but whether the balance\r\nof ammonia freed is utilised by the fungi themselves, or whether it\r\nis made available to nitrifying bacteria is not yet clear. If the\r\nlatter is the case, soil fungi play a valuable indirect rôle in the\r\naccumulation of available plant food in the soil. On the other hand, by\r\nutilising nitrates as sources of nitrogen, fungi may play an important\r\npart in the depletion of the nitrogenous food in the soil available to\r\ncrop plants. Thirdly, soil fungi apparently take no part in the direct\r\nnitrogen enrichment of the soil. Thus, soil fungi would seem to be the\r\nmost important factor in the first half of that great cycle whereby\r\norganic remains become again available as organic food.\r\n\r\nThe impression left on one’s mind by the study of the life of fungi\r\nin the soil is of an infinitely complex series of moving equilibria,\r\nthe living activities being determined by both biological and\r\nphysico-chemical conditions. All these factors play an integral part in\r\nthe life of the soil fungi and must be considered if a true picture is\r\nto be drawn. The principal factors may be classified into the following\r\ngroups: Most evident, perhaps, are the natures and specificities of\r\nthe fungi and the relative composition of the fungus flora. Equally\r\nimportant, however, are the quantity and quality of the foods available\r\nand the non-biological environment which results from the complex\r\nseries of physical and chemical changes occurring in the soil causally\r\nindependent of the organisms present, which interacts with the equally\r\nvast series of changes resulting from fungus activities. Finally, one\r\nmust consider the interacting biological environment of surface animals\r\nand plants and the microscopic fauna and flora. The complexities are\r\nsuch that only the application of Baconian principles can unravel\r\nthem. A beginning has been made in the study of pure cultures of soil\r\nfungi on synthetic media, and much valuable data have accrued, but\r\nit is obviously not possible to apply directly to soil the results\r\nobtained in such work. They remain possibilities; in certain cases\r\nprobabilities, but nothing more. A further step, one already taken\r\nand of great promise, is the investigation of the changes occurring\r\nin sterilised soils inoculated with known quantities of one or more\r\npure cultures of particular soil fungi. Such intensive study of single\r\nfactors in a standardised natural or artificial soil, to which has been\r\nadded a pedigreed fungus, is, perhaps, the most fruitful avenue of\r\nprogress. In all such work, however, one must bear acutely in mind the\r\nfact that a sterilised soil and, still more, an artificial soil, is a\r\nvery different complex from a normal soil, and that results obtained\r\nfrom the inoculation of such soils are not applicable directly in the\r\nelucidation of ordinary soil processes. At present there is no method\r\nknown of completely sterilising a soil which does not destroy the\r\noriginal physico-chemical balance. It is evident that the complexities\r\nare such that chemist, physicist, and biologist must all co-operate\r\nif the significance of the processes is to be understood, and a solid\r\nfoundation laid for future progress and for practical application.\r\n\r\n  [1] Appel, O., “Untersuchungen über die Gattung _Fusarium_,” Mitt.\r\n  Biol.

There now remains to be considered\r\nthe fauna of invertebrate animals, other than protozoa, which inhabit\r\nthat same medium. In the first place, it is necessary to define what\r\ngroups of invertebrate animals are to be regarded as coming under the\r\ncategory of soil organisms. The latter expression has rather a wide\r\napplication and, for the present purpose, is held to mean any organism\r\nof its kind which, in some stage or stages of its life-cycle, lives\r\non or below the surface of the soil. It will be obvious that, with so\r\ncomprehensive a definition, the intimacy of the association of these\r\nanimals with the soil will vary within very wide limits. Some animals\r\npass their whole life-cycle in the soil; others are only present during\r\na limited phase, and not necessarily in a trophic condition, but since\r\ntheir occurrence is constant, they cannot be entirely omitted from\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nUnlike the groups of organisms which have been dealt with in the\r\nforegoing pages, the invertebrates of the soil do not admit, as a rule,\r\nof investigation in culture media. It is, in consequence, much more\r\ndifficult to achieve in the laboratory the same control over their\r\nenvironmental conditions. This fact in itself largely explains why\r\nthe interpretations of field observations in animal ecology have not\r\nusually been subjected to the test of laboratory experimentation. The\r\nstudy of animal ecology, in so far as the denizens of the soil are\r\nconcerned, is of very recent birth. It has not, as yet, passed the\r\npreliminary stage of cataloguing empirical data, and much spade work\r\nwill be necessary before the various factors controlling the phenomena\r\nactually observed are understood.\r\n\r\nOwing to the paucity of information available, this chapter is\r\nessentially based upon observations conducted at Rothamsted. Its object\r\nis not so much to attempt to evaluate the invertebrate fauna of the\r\nsoil, as to suggest a line of ecological work demanding investigation\r\non land of many different types.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF INVESTIGATING THE SOIL FAUNA.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted at Rothamsted consists in taking weekly soil samples\r\nfrom a given area for a period of twelve months. Each sample is a cube\r\nof soil, with a side dimension of nine inches, and a total content\r\nof 729 cubic inches. The samples are taken by means of an apparatus\r\nconsisting of four iron plates, which are driven into the ground down\r\nto the required depth so as to form a kind of box, which encloses a\r\ncube of soil (_vide_ Morris, 1922 A). The latter is then removed in\r\nlayers, each layer being transferred to a separate bag for the purpose.\r\nWhen the complete sample has been extracted, there are five bags\r\ncontaining layers of soil taken from the surface to a depth of 1″, from\r\n1″ to 3″, from 3″ to 5″, from 5″ to 7″, and 7″ to 9″ respectively.\r\nBelow a depth of 9″ no samples have been taken.\r\n\r\nThe sample obtained in this manner may be gradually worked into small\r\nfragments by hand, and examined whenever necessary under a binocular\r\nmicroscope for the smaller organisms present. This procedure, however,\r\nis very tedious and has been replaced by the use of an apparatus\r\nconsisting of a series of three sieves, with meshes of decreasing size\r\n(_vide_ Morris, 1922). The soil is washed through these sieves by means\r\nof a stream of water, and the meshes of the final strainer are small\r\nenough to retain all except the most minute organisms present, while at\r\nthe same time they allow the finest soil particles to be carried away.\r\nWhen desirable, the effluent can be passed through a bag or sieve of\r\nbolting silk, in order to collect such organisms that may have passed\r\nthrough the third sieve.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the actual taking and examination of the samples, a\r\nbotanical survey of the area under investigation is made; chemical\r\nand mechanical analyses of the soil are also required. It is further\r\nnecessary to take soil temperature readings, to determine the moisture\r\ncontent of the samples taken, and the amount of organic matter which\r\nthey contain.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUPS OF INVERTEBRATA REPRESENTED IN THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe various groups of invertebrates represented in the soil may be\r\nbriefly referred to in zoological order.\r\n\r\n_Nematoda._--The Nematoda or thread-worms are chiefly animal parasites,\r\nnevertheless they usually lead an independent existence in the soil\r\nin certain stages of their development. The numerous small species\r\nbelonging to the family _Anguillididæ_, or eel-worms, form a definite\r\nconstituent of the soil fauna; they are generally free-living and\r\nnon-parasitic. Certain members of this family, however, are enemies of\r\ncultivated plants.\r\n\r\n_Annelida._--Terrestrial Annelida are almost entirely confined to the\r\norder _Oligochæta_, the majority of which are earthworms (_Terricolæ_),\r\nwhose whole life-cycle is passed within the confines of the soil.\r\nThe small white worms of the family _Enchytræidæ_ belong to the\r\naquatic section (_Limicolæ_) of the order, but they have various\r\nrepresentatives which are abundant in damp soil containing organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n_Mollusca._--The terrestrial Mollusca are included in the sub-order\r\n_Pulmonata_ of the _Gastropoda_. These organisms, which include the\r\nsnails (_Helicidæ_) and slugs (_Limacidæ_), regularly deposit their\r\neggs in moist earth. Slugs adopt the soil as a frequent habitat, only\r\nleaving it for feeding purposes in the presence of sufficient moisture.\r\nThey are frequent consumers of vegetation, with the exception of\r\n_Testacella_, which is carnivorous.\r\n\r\n_Crustacea._--The few species of Crustacea inhabiting the soil belong\r\nto the order _Isopoda_, family _Oniscidæ_, which are popularly referred\r\nto as “woodlice,” “slaters,” etc.\r\n\r\n_Myriapoda._--The _Diplopoda_ or millipedes include enemies of\r\nvarious crops and are common denizens of the soil. The _Chilopoda_ or\r\ncentipedes are usually less abundant and are carnivorous. The minute\r\n_Symphyla_ are often evident but are of minor importance.\r\n\r\n_Insecta._--Insects form the dominant element in the invertebrate\r\nfauna. Phytophagous species devour the subterranean parts of plants,\r\nand notable examples are afforded by the larvæ of _Melolontha_,\r\n_Agriotes_ and _Tipula_. Saprophagous forms are abundantly represented\r\nby the _Collembola_, and by numerous larval _Diptera_ and _Coleoptera_.\r\nPredaceous species preying upon other members of the soil fauna\r\nare exemplified by the _Carabidæ_ and many larval _Diptera_.\r\nParasitic species pass their larval stages on or within the bodies\r\nof other organisms. The groups of _Hymenoptera_, and the dipterous\r\nfamily _Tachinidæ_, which exhibit this habit, constitute, along\r\nwith predaceous forms, one of the most important natural agencies\r\ncontrolling the multiplication of insect life. There are also insects\r\n(ants, and other of the aculeate _Hymenoptera_) which utilize the\r\nsoil as a suitable medium wherein to construct their habitations or\r\nbrood chambers, without necessarily deriving their food from the soil.\r\nLastly, there are many insects, notably _Lepidoptera_, which only\r\nresort to the soil for the purpose of undergoing pupation. The insect\r\nfauna is, therefore, a closely inter-connected biological complex; for\r\na discussion and an enumeration of its representatives reference may be\r\nmade to papers by Cameron (1913, 1917), and Morris (1921, 1922 a).\r\n\r\n_Arachnida._--The two principal classes represented in the soil are the\r\n_Areinida_, or spiders, and the _Acarina_, or mites, and ticks. The\r\n_Areinida_, which are well-known to be carnivorous, are an unimportant\r\nconstituent of the fauna. _Acarina_, on the other hand, are abundant,\r\nand exhibit a wide range of feeding habits; most of the soil forms are\r\nprobably carnivorous, and either free-living or parasitic.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF ORGANISMS PRESENT AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION IN DEPTH.\r\n\r\nIn computing the number of invertebrates normally present in a given\r\ntype of soil, the method adopted consists of making individual counts\r\nof all such organisms as occur in each sample of a series taken over\r\na period of twelve months. This method considerably reduces errors\r\ndue to season and to the possible deviation of one or more samples\r\nfrom the average. If the total number of these organisms is known for\r\nthe samples taken, it becomes a simple procedure to arrive at their\r\napproximate numbers per acre.\r\n\r\nTABLE XIV.\r\n\r\n(Based on Morris, 1922 A.)\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |                              |Unmanured Plot.|Manured Plot.|\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Insects                       |   2,474,700   |  7,727,300  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Larger Nematoda and Oligochæta|               |             |\r\n  |  Limicolæ                    |     794,600   |  3,600,400  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Myriapoda--                   |               |             |\r\n  |  Diplopoda                   |     596,000   |  1,367,000  |\r\n  |  Chilopoda                   |     215,400   |    208,700  |\r\n  |  Symphyla                    |      64,000   |    215,500  |\r\n  |                              +---------------+-------------+\r\n  |    Total                     |     875,400   |  1,791,200  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Oligochæta (Terricolæ)        |     457,900   |  1,010,100  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Arachnida--                   |               |             |\r\n  |  Acarina                     |     215,400   |    531,900  |\r\n  |  Areinida                    |      20,200   |     20,200  |\r\n  |                              +---------------+-------------+\r\n  |    Total                     |     235,600   |    552,100  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Crustacea (Isopoda)           |      33,700   |     80,800  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |Mollusca (Pulmonata)          |      13,500   |     33,700  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n  |    Total Invertebrata        |   4,885,400   | 14,795,600  |\r\n  +------------------------------+---------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Distribution in depth of the more important\r\ngroups of soil invertebrates in the manured and unmanured (or control)\r\nplots at Rothamsted. (From Morris, “Annals of Applied Biology,” vol.\r\nix., nos. 3 and 4, Cambridge University Press.)]\r\n\r\nTable XIV. represents a numerical estimate of the invertebrate fauna of\r\ntwo plots of arable land at Rothamsted. The soil is clay with flints\r\noverlying chalk, and the land in question has been devoted for eighty\r\nyears to continuous cropping with wheat; one plot (No. 3) receives an\r\nannual dressing of farmyard manure at the rate of 14 tons per acre, and\r\nthe other plot (No. 2) receives no natural or artificial fertilizer.\r\nThe significant feature in a comparison of the fauna of the two plots\r\nis the great numerical increase in organisms due to the addition of\r\nmanure. From the point of view of distribution in depth, Fig. 20\r\nclearly demonstrates that the bulk of the fauna is concentrated in the\r\nfirst three inches of the soil. With the exception of the _Acarina_ it\r\nis evident that the limits of vertical distribution extend below the\r\ndepth of nine inches investigated, although the numbers of organisms\r\nlikely to be present are inconsiderable. The _Oligochæta_, or true\r\nearthworms, occur in Rothamsted soil in numbers very much in excess of\r\nthe figures given by Darwin, who quoted observations by Hensen. The\r\nlatter authority calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms in an\r\nacre of garden soil, and estimated that about half that number would\r\nbe present in an acre of corn field. In the Rothamsted investigations\r\ntheir numbers exceeded Hensen’s estimate over 16 times in unmanured\r\nland, and over 36 times in manured land.\r\n\r\nIn an area of pasture-land in Cheshire few insects occurred below\r\na depth of 2 inches, and they reached the limit of their vertical\r\ndistribution at or near 6 inches. Their number (3,586,000 per acre)\r\nis considerably in excess of that present in unmanured arable land at\r\nRothamsted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, _Collembola_; 2, _Thysanura_; 3, _Orthoptera_; 4, _Thysanoptera_;\r\n  5, _Hemiptera_; 6, _Lepidoptera_; 7, _Coleoptera_; 8, _Diptera_; 9,\r\n  _Hymenoptera_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 21.--Number of individuals in the different orders of insects in\r\nmanured and unmanured arable land at Rothamsted. (From Morris, “Annals\r\nof Applied Biology,” vol. ix., nos. 3 and 4, Cambridge University\r\nPress.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINANCE OF CERTAIN SPECIES AND GROUPS.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 21 a numerical analysis is given of the different orders\r\nof insects represented in Rothamsted soil. The ascendency of the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Collembola_ is almost entirely due to the occurrence\r\nof three species in large numbers, viz., the ant _Myrmica lævinodis_\r\nand the _Collembola_, _Onychiurus ambulans_ and _O. fimetarius_. In\r\nthe unmanured plot these two _Collembola_ constituted 13 per cent. of\r\nthe insects and the species of ant accounted for nearly 28 per cent.\r\nIn the manured plot they amounted respectively to 27 per cent. and 36\r\nper cent. of the insects present. Next in order of numerical ascendency\r\nare larval _Diptera_, mainly belonging to the families _Cecidomyidæ_,\r\n_Chironomidæ_, and _Mycetophilidæ_. The _Diptera_ are followed by\r\nthe _Coleoptera_, whose most abundant representatives are larval\r\n_Elateridæ_ (wireworms).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, _Collembola_; 2, _Thysanura_; 3, _Orthoptera_; 4, _Thysanoptera_;\r\n  5, _Hemiptera_; 6, _Lepidoptera_; 7, _Coleoptera_; 8, _Diptera_; 9,\r\n  _Hymenoptera_; 10, _Diplopoda_; 11, _Chilopoda_; 12, _Areinida_; 13,\r\n  _Acarina_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 22.--Number of species of different orders of invertebrates\r\npresent in the manured and unmanured (or control) plots at Rothamsted.\r\n(From Morris, “Annals of Applied Biology,” vol. ix., nos. 3 and 4,\r\nCambridge University Press.)]\r\n\r\nIn point of view of number of species present (Fig. 22), _Coleoptera_\r\ntake the front rank; in the unmanured plot they are very closely\r\napproached by _Collembola_ and _Diptera_.\r\n\r\nPassing from the insects, the next assemblage of organisms in point of\r\nnumber of individuals are the smaller worms. The difficulties attending\r\nthe specific identification of these organisms are great, and, in the\r\npresent survey, the _Nematodes_ and all the smaller _Oligochætes_ have\r\nnot been separated.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of the _Myriapoda_ is mainly due to the prevalence of\r\n_Diplopoda_, which are represented by four species. The _Chilopoda_\r\nalmost entirely consist of a single species _Geophilus longicornis_.\r\n\r\nThe dominant group of the _Arachnida_ is the _Acarine_ family\r\n_Gamascidæ_, which are represented by about a dozen species.\r\n\r\n  +---------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  |         |Phytophagous.|Saprophagous.|Carnivorous.|Heterophagous.|\r\n  +---------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  |Unmanured|             |             |            |              |\r\n  |plot     |     14      |     48      |     13     |      20      |\r\n  |Manured  |             |             |            |              |\r\n  |plot     |     13      |     58      |      9     |      20      |\r\n  +---------+-------------+-------------+------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF SOIL INVERTEBRATES ACCORDING TO FEEDING HABITS.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the fauna as a whole, the zoological\r\nclassification of the soil invertebrates is only significant when the\r\nvarious groups are analysed according to the feeding habits of their\r\nmembers. All animals are directly or indirectly dependent upon plant\r\nlife for their nutrition. For the present purpose they are divided\r\ninto four categories, and the position of each class of animals in the\r\nscheme is based upon the habits of its chief representatives in the\r\nsoil. Definite information on this subject, however, is not always\r\nforthcoming, and it is only possible to achieve approximate estimates.\r\nIn the table above the percentages in number of individuals present in\r\nthe two plots investigated at Rothamsted are given under each type of\r\nfeeding habit.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that these estimates only apply to average\r\nconditions; the outbreak of a plant pest in any one year must naturally\r\nmaterially alter the proportions given. The phytophagous organisms are\r\nrepresented by a certain number of the _Insecta_ together with the\r\npulmonate _Mollusca_. Carnivorous forms which are mainly beneficial\r\nfrom the agricultural standpoint, include _Insecta_, together with\r\nthe _Chilopoda_, many _Acarina_ and the _Areinida_. Saprophagous\r\nforms constitute the dominant element of the soil fauna. More than\r\n30 per cent. of the _Insecta_ exhibit this habit, which is also the\r\ndominant one in the _Oligochæta_, _Symphyla_, and in many of the soil\r\n_Nematodes_. Heterophagous species include all those of somewhat\r\nplastic habits; for the most part they are saprophagous, but, on the\r\nother hand, a considerable proportion of the species attack growing\r\nplants or exhibit both habits. Under this category are included a\r\ncertain number of the _Insecta_, the _Diplopoda_, _Isopoda_, and some\r\n_Acarina_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS UPON THE INVERTEBRATES OF THE\r\nSOIL.\r\n\r\nSince animals are endowed with powers of independent locomotion: they\r\nare not necessarily tied to their environment to the same extent\r\nthat plants are. The investigation of the influence of environmental\r\nfactors sooner or later involves a study of the tropisms of the\r\nanimals concerned. Until these are adequately understood it is\r\nscarcely possible to arrive at any exact conclusions relative to their\r\nbehaviour in the soil. Insects, for example, respond to the stimuli of\r\nvarious, and often apparently insignificant forces, acting upon their\r\nsensory organs. Such responses are known as chemotropism, phototropism,\r\nhydrotropism, thermotropism, and so forth according to the nature of\r\nthe stimuli. Tropisms are automatic and, so far as they distinguish\r\nsensations, are independent of any choice, and consequently of psychic\r\nphenomena. Animal automatism, however, does not present the rigidity\r\nof mechanical automatism. Differential sensibility, vital rhythms, or\r\nperiodicity, etc., are other important aspects of animal behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe environmental factors, affecting more especially the insect\r\npopulation of the soil, have been discussed by Cameron (1917) and\r\nHamilton (1917), and certain broader aspects of animal ecology by\r\nAdams (1915) and Shelford (1912). These factors are so numerous and\r\nso inter-connected, that it is only possible to refer to them briefly\r\nin the space available. As might be expected, soils that are of a\r\nlight and open texture are the ones most frequented by soil insects,\r\nnutritional and other factors being equal. Furthermore, it has already\r\nbeen shown that in arable land insects and other animals penetrate to\r\na greater depth than in pastures. This fact is primarily due to the\r\ngreater looseness of the soil occasioned by agricultural operations,\r\nwhich ensure at the same time better drainage aeration, and greater\r\nfacilities for penetration. Hamilton found that soil insect larvæ are\r\nvery sensitive to evaporation, and especially so if the temperature\r\nis 20° C. or over. In their natural habitat the relative humidity of\r\nthe air, in moist or wet soil, is not far below saturation, and the\r\ntemperature of the soil rarely goes above 20°-23°C., and then only in\r\nexposed, dry, hard soil in which these larvæ do not occur.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the rate of evaporation as an environmental\r\nfactor was first emphasised by Shelford. According to him the best\r\nand more accurate index of the varying physical conditions affecting\r\nland animals, wholly or in part exposed to the atmosphere, is the\r\nevaporating power of air. By means of a porous cup-atmometer, as\r\ndevised by Livingston, Shelford has carried out an important series\r\nof experiments on the reactions of various animals to atmospheres of\r\ndifferent evaporation capacities, and reference should be made to his\r\ntext-book.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the organic matter present in the soil is well\r\nillustrated in the table on p. 152. The great increase in the number of\r\ninsects and other animals is partly due to their direct introduction\r\nalong with the manure, and partly to their entry into the soil in\r\nresponse to chemotropic stimuli exerted by fermentation. Organic matter\r\ninfluences the fauna in other ways also; it increases the moisture\r\ncontent of the soil, and it provides many species with an abundance of\r\nfood material. Also, the amount of carbon dioxide present in the soil\r\nis partly dependent upon decaying organic matter. Hamilton conducted\r\nexperiments on the behaviour of certain soil insects in relation to\r\nvarying amounts of carbon dioxide. Although his work is of too limited\r\na nature to be accepted without reserve, it lends support to the\r\nconclusions of Adams who says: “The animals which thrive in the soil\r\nare likely to be those which tolerate a large amount of carbon dioxide,\r\nand are able to use a relatively small amount of oxygen, at least for\r\nconsiderable intervals, as when the soil is wet during prolonged rains.\r\nThe optimum soil habitat is therefore determined, to a very important\r\ndegree, by the proper ratio or balance between the amount of available\r\noxygen and the amount of carbon dioxide which can be endured without\r\ninjury.”\r\n\r\nLittle is known concerning the occurrence of ammonia in the soil\r\natmosphere, but its presence in minute quantities is probably an\r\nimportant chemotropic factor in relation to saprophagous organisms\r\nwhich are the largest constituent of the fauna. A great increase in\r\nDipterous larvæ occurs on the addition of farmyard manure, and this\r\nis noteworthy in the light of Richardson’s experiments (1916), which\r\nindicate that ammonia exercises a marked attraction for _Diptera_,\r\nwhich spend some part of their existence in animal excrement in some\r\nform or another.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the vegetation supported by the soil is of paramount\r\nimportance in relation to phytophagous organisms, and examples need\r\nscarcely be instanced of certain species of soil insects being\r\ndependent upon the presence of their specific food plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF SOIL INVERTEBRATES TO AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe relation of these organisms to agriculture may be considered from\r\nthree points of view: (_a_) their influence upon the soil itself; (_b_)\r\ntheir relation to the nitrogen cycle; and (_c_), their direct influence\r\nupon economic plants.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The behaviour of earthworms as a factor inducing soil fertility\r\nis discussed by Darwin in his well-known work on the subject, and their\r\naction may be briefly summarised as follows. In feeding habits they\r\nare very largely saprophagous, and consume decaying vegetable matter\r\nincluding humus, which they swallow, together with large quantities of\r\nsoil. Earthworms come to the surface to discharge their fæces (“worm\r\ncasts”), and in this process they are continually bringing up some of\r\nthe deeper soil to the air. Darwin estimated that earthworms annually\r\nbrought to the surface of the soil in their “casts” sufficient earth\r\nto form a layer ·2 inch in depth, or 10 tons per acre. Their action,\r\nalong with the atmosphere, are the chief agencies which produce the\r\nuniformity and looseness of texture of the surface soil. By means of\r\ntheir burrows earthworms facilitate the penetration of air and water\r\ninto the soil, while their habit of dragging leaves and other vegetable\r\nmaterial into these burrows increases the organic matter present\r\nbelow the surface. These facts are generally agreed upon, but it is a\r\ndisputed point whether earthworms, by devouring organic matter, aid the\r\nconversion of the latter into plant food more rapidly than takes place\r\nsolely through the activities of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nSoil insects and other arthropods, by their burrowing activities,\r\nare also instrumental in loosening the soil texture and thereby\r\nfacilitating soil aeration and the percolation of water. The action of\r\ntermites in warmer countries is discussed by Drummond in his “Tropical\r\nAfrica,” who compares the rôle of subterranean termites to that of\r\nearthworms. The great abundance of ants renders them also significant\r\nin this same respect, and very few species are direct enemies of the\r\nagriculturist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Diagram showing the Relation of the Soil\r\nInvertebrata (other than Protozoa) to the Nitrogen Cycle.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) In their relation to the nitrogen cycle (_vide_ p. 174), the\r\nactivities of the soil invertebrates may be expressed diagrammatically,\r\nas a side-chain in the process (Fig. 23). The proteins, elaborated by\r\nplants, are utilised as nitrogenous food by the phytophagous animals\r\npresent. The waste products of the latter, which contain the nitrogen\r\nnot used for growth or the replacement of loss by wear and tear, are\r\nreturned to the soil. Here they disintegrate, and are ultimately\r\nconverted into ammonium salts, mainly by bacterial action. The dead\r\nbodies of these animals are also broken down by various means, becoming\r\neventually chemically dissociated and available as plant food. Animal\r\n(and plant) residues serve, however, as food for the large number of\r\nsaprophagous invertebrates present in the soil. In this event the\r\nnitrogen contained in such residues becomes “locked up,” as it were,\r\nfor the time being in their bodies. Both saprophagous and phytophagous\r\nanimals are preyed upon by carnivorous species, but ultimately the\r\nnitrogen is returned to the soil upon the death of those organisms.\r\nThe amount present in the bodies of the whole invertebrate fauna has\r\nbeen calculated by Morris (1922) upon analyses furnished by chemists\r\nat Rothamsted. It is estimated that the fauna of manured land contains\r\nabout 7349 grm., or 16·2 lb. of nitrogen per acre, and that of\r\nuntreated land, 3490 grm., or 7·5 lb. per acre. These amounts are equal\r\nrespectively to the nitrogen content of 103·6 lb. and 48 lb. of nitrate\r\nof soda.\r\n\r\nThe primary question affecting agriculture is, whether any notable\r\nloss of nitrogen is occasioned by the presence of these organisms in\r\nthe soil. It has been mentioned that their nitrogenous waste material,\r\nand their dead bodies, ultimately undergo disintegration; any loss,\r\nif any, takes place during the latter process. With the more complex\r\ncompounds it probably consists in the production of amino-acids and\r\ntheir subsequent hydrolysis or oxidation. During this process an\r\nappreciable loss of nitrogen in the gaseous form occurs. This loss,\r\nwhich is discussed on p. 173 would represent the net deficit occasioned\r\nby the incidence of invertebrates in the soil. Against this loss must\r\nbe placed the beneficial action of such organisms as earthworms, which,\r\nin all probability, more than counterbalances it.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Many soil insects, on account of their phytophagous habits, are\r\nwell-known to be some of the most serious enemies of agriculture.\r\nCertain of these, and also other classes of invertebrates, which are\r\nlikewise directly injurious, have been instanced in the earlier pages\r\nof this chapter. Detailed information on this subject will be found in\r\ntextbooks of economic zoology, notably the volume by Reh (1913).\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE REFERRED TO.\r\n\r\n  ADAMS, C.

These organisms all live in the soil, and\r\ntherefore must find in it the conditions necessary for their growth.\r\nWe have dealt in the first chapter with the supplies of water, air,\r\nand heat, without which life is clearly impossible. Equally necessary\r\nis the source of energy, for the organism requires energy material as\r\nsurely as the motor engine requires petrol, and it ceases to function\r\nunless an adequate supply is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nAll the energy comes in the first instance from the sun, if we exclude\r\nthe unknown but probably small fraction coming from radio-active\r\nelements. But this radiant energy is not utilisable by the soil\r\npopulation, excepting surface algæ; it has to be transformed into\r\nanother kind. So far, chlorophyll is the only known transformer;\r\nit fixes the energy of sunlight and stores it up in bodies like\r\nhemicellulose, sugar, starch, protein, etc. The transformation is\r\nimperfect; even the heaviest yielding crops grown under glass, in\r\nconditions made as favourable as our knowledge permits, utilise only\r\nabout 4 per cent. of the total energy available during their period of\r\ngrowth; in natural conditions not more than 0·4 per cent. is utilised.\r\nSuch as it is, however, the energy fixed in the plant represents all,\r\nindeed more than all, that the soil organisms can obtain.\r\n\r\nIn the state of Nature, vegetation dies and is left on the soil. Two\r\nthings may then happen. It may become drawn into the soil by earthworms\r\nand other agents; the energy supply is thus distributed in the soil\r\nto serve the needs of the varied soil population. This is the normal\r\ncase, associated with the normal soil population and the normal flora.\r\nIf, however, the mingling agents are absent, the dead vegetation lies\r\nlike a mat on the surface of the soil, only partially decomposing,\r\nunsuitable for the growth of most seedlings, and effectually preventing\r\nmost of the vegetation below from pushing a way through: thus there\r\ncomes to be no vegetation at all, or only a very restricted and special\r\nflora. The soil population becomes also specialised. Peats and acid\r\ngrassland afford examples.\r\n\r\nOn the neutral grass plots at Rothamsted, the dead vegetation does not\r\naccumulate on the surface but is rapidly decomposed or drawn into the\r\nsoil, leaving the surface of the earth bare and free for the growth\r\nof seedlings. On the acid plots dead vegetation remains long on the\r\nsurface, blotting out all new growth excepting two or three grasses\r\nwhich form underground runners capable of penetrating the mat, and\r\nsorrel, the seedling roots of which seem to have the power of boring\r\nthrough a fibrous layer of this sort. It is possible to remove the\r\nmat entirely by bacterial action alone, if sufficient lime be added\r\nperiodically to make the reaction neutral, but failing these repeated\r\nadditions the mat persists.\r\n\r\nWe shall confine ourselves to the normal case where earthworms bring\r\nthe source of energy into the soil.\r\n\r\nDirectly the energy is available, it begins to be utilised. Two laws\r\ngovern the change. The first is well-known to biologists: it states\r\nthat the total energy of the system remains constant and can neither\r\nbe increased nor diminished except from outside; in other words, that\r\nenergy can be neither created nor destroyed. The second law is less\r\nfamiliar: it is that energy once transformed to heat by one organism\r\ncannot be used again by another. It is not destroyed; it remains\r\nintact, but is useless to the organism. One cannot have an indefinite\r\nchain of organisms living on each other’s excretory products; there was\r\na certain quantity of energy in the food eaten by the first, and no\r\nmore than this quantity can be got out whether one organism obtains the\r\nwhole or whether others share it.\r\n\r\nThe outside value for the amount of energy fixed in the soil is\r\nobtainable by combustion of the soil in a calorimeter, but much of\r\nthis is not available to the soil organisms. The normal sedimentary\r\nsoils of England still contain decomposition products of the débris\r\nof plants and animals originally deposited with them, but in the long\r\ncourse of ages much of the extractable energy has been utilised. The\r\nsoil population is thus dependent on recently grown vegetation, and it\r\nis therefore largely confined to the layer, usually in this country\r\nabout 6 inches thick, through which the recently dead vegetation is\r\ndistributed. Below this level there may be sufficient air, water,\r\ntemperature, etc., but there is insufficient source of energy for any\r\nlarge population.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no ready means for distinguishing between the\r\ntotal and the actually available quantity of energy in the soil. But\r\nit is not difficult, by adopting the Rothamsted analytical method, to\r\nascertain the approximate amount of energy that has been transformed in\r\na given period. The Rothamsted plots are periodically analysed and a\r\nbalance sheet is drawn up showing how much of each constituent has been\r\nadded to and removed from the soil in the intervening period. For two\r\nof the Broadbalk plots the results are shown in Tables XV., XVI.\r\n\r\nThe dunged plot receives 14 tons farmyard manure per annum, a quantity\r\nin excess of what would usually be given; the unmanured plot, on the\r\nother hand, has received no manure for many years and is abnormally\r\npoor. Normal soils lie somewhere between these limits, but tending\r\nrather to the value for the dunged than for the unmanured plot. It will\r\nbe seen that each acre of the dunged land loses on an average 41,000\r\ncalories per day, while each acre of the unmanured land loses on an\r\naverage 2700 calories per day.\r\n\r\nTABLE XV.--MATERIAL BALANCE SHEET: BROADBALK SOIL, ROTHAMSTED.\r\n\r\n(LB.

Nature\r\nseems to be in an unexpectedly economical mood in the soil, and all\r\ncompounds which can be oxidised with liberation of energy seem to\r\nhave corresponding organisms capable of utilising them. Even phenol,\r\nbenzene, hydrogen, and marsh gas can all be oxidised and utilised as\r\nenergy sources by some of the soil population.\r\n\r\nEven with this remarkable power the soil population has insufficient\r\nenergy to satisfy all its possibilities; our present knowledge\r\nindicates that energy supply is, in this country at any rate, the\r\nfactor limiting the numbers of the population. Increases in the water\r\nsupply or the temperature of the soil produce no consistent effect on\r\nthe population, but directly the energy supply is increased the numbers\r\nat once rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL CHANGES.\r\n\r\nThese transformations of energy involve transformations of matter.\r\nThe original plant residues may be divided roughly into substances\r\nforming the structure of the plant, such as the hemicelluloses, the\r\npentosans, gums, and the contents of the cell--the protoplasm and the\r\nstorage products, protein; in addition, there are smaller quantities of\r\nfats and waxes and other constituents. Some of the easily-decomposable\r\ncarbohydrates never reach the soil at all, being broken down by\r\nintracellular respiration or attack of micro-organisms. But much of the\r\nstructure material--hemicelluloses, pentosans, etc.--remains.\r\n\r\nOnce the plant residues pass through the earthworm bodies they become\r\ncompletely disintegrated and lose all signs of structure.\r\n\r\nThe only visible product so far known is humus, the black sticky\r\nsubstance characteristic of soil and of manure. Two modes of formation\r\nhave been suggested. Carbohydrates, sugars, pentosans, etc., are\r\nknown to yield furfuraldehyde or hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde on\r\ndecomposition, and it has been shown at Rothamsted that this readily\r\ncondenses to form a humus-like body, if not humus itself. In the\r\nlaboratory the reaction is effected in presence of acid, but even\r\namino-acids suffice. All the necessary conditions occur in the soil,\r\nand humus formation may proceed in this way.\r\n\r\nSome of the structure material--the lignin--contains aromatic ring\r\ngroupings. Fischer and Schrader have shown that in alkaline conditions\r\nthese ring substances absorb oxygen and form something very like humus.\r\nIt is quite possible that humus formation also proceeds in the soil\r\nin this way. Whether the two products are chemically identical is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe scheme can be represented thus:--\r\n\r\n                      Cell structure material\r\n                                  |\r\n                 +----------------+----------------+\r\n                 |                                 |\r\n             Aliphatic                         Aromatic\r\n          (Hemicelluloses,                   (Lignin, etc.,\r\n          Pentosans, etc.)                   in presence of\r\n                 |                          oxygen and under\r\n         +-------+------------+            aerobic conditions)\r\n         |                    |                    |\r\n    Fatty acids         Furfuraldehyde             |\r\n         |                    or                   |\r\n         |        Hydroxymethylfurfuraldehyde      |\r\n         |           (in presence of acid)         |\r\n         |                     ·                   |\r\n         |                       ·                 |\r\n         |                         ·               |\r\n         |                           ·             |\r\n         |                             ·           |\r\n         |                               ·         |\r\n         |                                 ·       |\r\n         |                                   ·     |\r\n         |                                     ·   |\r\n         ↓                                      ↘  ↓\r\n  Calcium carbonate.                            Humus.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of the cell and the first stages in the\r\ndecomposition of the structure material are almost certainly brought\r\nabout by micro-organisms. Whether they complete the process is not\r\nknown: purely chemical agencies could easily account for part.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of protein in the soil has not been studied in any\r\ndetail. From what is known of the acid hydrolysis and the putrefactive\r\ndecompositions, however, it is not difficult to draw up a scheme which,\r\nat any rate, accords with the facts at present known. It is probable\r\nthat the protein gives rise to amino-acids, which then break down by\r\none of the known general reactions.\r\n\r\nTwo types of non-nitrogenous products may be expected: The aliphatic\r\namino-acids give rise to ammonia and fatty acids; these form\r\ncalcium salts which break down to calcium carbonate. The aromatic\r\namino-acids--tyrosin, phenylalanine, etc.--which would account for\r\nabout 6 per cent. of the nitrogen of vegetable proteins, would be\r\nexpected to give ammonia and phenolic substances. Now phenols are\r\npoisonous to plants and if no method existed for their removal the\r\naccumulation would ultimately render the soil sterile. Matters would be\r\neven worse on cultivated soils, since cows’ urine, which enters into\r\nthe composition of farmyard manure and is the chief constituent of\r\nliquid manure, contains, according to Mooser, no less than 0·25 to 0·77\r\ngrams of _p_-cresol per litre,[I] a quantity three to ten times that\r\npresent in human urine. Fortunately this contingency never arises, for\r\nthe soil contains a remarkable set of organisms capable of decomposing\r\nthe phenols and leaving the soil entirely suitable for plant growth.\r\nThis affords an interesting case of an organism--in this case the\r\nplant--growing well in a medium in spite of some adverse condition, not\r\nbecause it is specially adapted to meet this condition, but because\r\nsome wholly different agent removes it.\r\n\r\n  [I] Mooser, Zeitschrift physiol. Chem., 1909, lxiii., 176. No phenol\r\n  was found. It is possible that the _p_-cresol is not entirely derived\r\n  from the protein, but that some comes from the glucosides in the\r\n  animals’ food.\r\n\r\nOther ring compounds, e.g. pyrrol, arise in smaller quantity in the\r\ndecomposition of protein, but their fate in the soil is not known.\r\n\r\nWe may summarise the probable changes of the protein as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                 Protein.\r\n                +-------------------+------------------+\r\n                |                   |                  |\r\n            Aliphatic           Aromatic             Other\r\n           amino-acids         amino-acids         compounds\r\n                |                   |           (Pyrrol, etc.)\r\n       +--------+--------+ +--------+--------+\r\n       |                 | |                 |\r\n  Fatty acids and      Ammonia           Phenolic\r\n  hydroxy acids           |              compounds\r\n       |               Nitrite               |\r\n       |                  |                  |\r\n       |                  |                  |\r\n       ↓                  ↓                  ↓\r\n    Calcium            Nitrate              CO₂\r\n   carbonate\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the evidence is indirect. The rate of\r\noxidation of ammonia by bacteria in the soil is more rapid than the\r\nrate of formation, so that ammonia is practically never found in the\r\nsoil in more than minimal amounts (1 or 2 parts per 1,000,000); indeed,\r\nthe only evidence of its formation was for a long time the fact that\r\nno compound other than ammonia could be oxidised by the nitrifying\r\norganism. It has, however, since been shown at Rothamsted that ammonia\r\naccumulates in soils in which the nitrifying organism has been killed.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the mechanism of the oxidation of ammonia beyond\r\nthe fact that it is biological; the reaction is not easily effected\r\nchemically at ordinary temperatures. Possibly the organism assimilates\r\nammonia at one end of a chain of metabolic processes and excretes\r\nnitrates at the other. Or, the reaction may be simply a straight\r\noxidation for energy purposes, the ammonia changing to hydroxylamine\r\nand then to nitrous and nitric acids.\r\n\r\nThe nitrate does not remain long in the soil. Some is taken up by the\r\nplant and some is washed out from the soil. Part, however, either of\r\nthe nitrate itself or of one of its precursors is converted into an\r\ninsoluble form: probably it is changed into protein by the action of\r\nmicro-organisms; it then goes through the whole process once more.\r\n\r\nThese are the general outlines; they present no particular chemical\r\ndifficulties. When we come to details, however, there is much that\r\ncannot be understood.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is the slow rate at which complex nitrogen\r\ncompounds disappear from the soil in comparison with the rate of\r\noxidation of the carbon. Thus, in the original plant residues, there\r\nis some forty times as much carbon as nitrogen: before they have been\r\nlong in the soil there is only ten times as much carbon as nitrogen;\r\nthis seems to be the stable position. What is the reason for this\r\npreferential oxidation of the carbon? No explanation can yet be given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\n  X-axis: 1887-8 1890-1 1900-1 1910-11\r\n\r\n  Y-axis: ℔ per acre]\r\n\r\nAn equally difficult problem arises in connection with the length of\r\ntime the process will continue. Decomposition of the nitrogen compounds\r\nnever seems to be complete in the soil; it dribbles on interminably.\r\nIn the year 1870 Lawes and Gilbert cut off a block of soil from its\r\nsurroundings and undermined it so that the drainage water could be\r\ncollected and analysed. The soil has been kept free from vegetation\r\nor addition of nitrogen compounds from that time till now; yet it has\r\nnever failed to yield nitrates, and the annual yield falls off only\r\nvery slowly (Fig. 24). This same peculiarity is seen in the yield of\r\ncrops on unmanured land: it decreases, but very gradually; even after\r\neighty years the process is far from complete, and there is no sign\r\nthat it will ever come to an end.\r\n\r\nTABLE XVII.--APPROXIMATE LOSS OF NITROGEN FROM CULTIVATED SOILS:\r\nBROADBALK WHEAT FIELD, ROTHAMSTED, FORTY-NINE YEARS (1865-1914.)\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |                        | Rich Soil: Plot 2.  | Poor Soil: Plot 3.  |\r\n  |                        |   Lb. per Acre.     |     Lb. per Acre.   |\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Nitrogen in soil in 1865|·175 per cent. = 4340|·105 per cent. = 2720|\r\n  |Nitrogen added in       |                     |                     |\r\n  |manure, rain (5 lb. per |                     |                     |\r\n  |annum), and seed (2 lb. |                     |                     |\r\n  |per annum)              |       10,140        |        340          |\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Nitrogen expected in    |                     |                     |\r\n  |1914                    |       14,480        |       3060          |\r\n  |Nitrogen found in 1914  |·259 per cent. = 5950|·095 per cent. = 2590|\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Loss from soil          |         8530        |        470          |\r\n  |Nitrogen accounted for  |                     |                     |\r\n  |in crops                |         2500        |        750          |\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |Balance, being dead loss|         6030        |       -280[J]       |\r\n  |Annual dead loss        |          123        |       -  6[J]       |\r\n  +------------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n\r\n  [J] Gains. Possibly the result of bacterial action.\r\n\r\nA further remarkable fact connected with the decomposition of the\r\nnitrogen compounds is that it seems invariably to be accompanied by\r\nan evolution of gaseous nitrogen. Apparently there are two cases.\r\nUnder anaerobic conditions many of the soil organisms have the power\r\nof obtaining their necessary oxygen from nitrates, thereby causing\r\na change in the molecule which leads in some cases to liberation of\r\ngaseous nitrogen; but the same result seems to be attained in aerobic\r\nconditions, especially when carbon is being rapidly oxidised.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the reaction is the same, and that in spite of the\r\ngeneral aerobic conditions there is locally an anaerobic atmosphere.\r\nBut it is also possible that some direct oxidation of protein or\r\namino-acids may yield gaseous nitrogen. However it is brought about\r\nit affects a considerable proportion of the entire stock of nitrogen,\r\nand it becomes more serious as cultivation is intensified. Thus, on\r\nthe Broadbalk plot receiving farmyard manure the loss is particularly\r\nheavy; on the unmanured plot it cannot be detected. The nitrogen\r\nbalance-sheet is shown in Table XVII.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of carbonaceous matter, however, is not invariably\r\naccompanied by a net loss of nitrogen; in other circumstances there is\r\na net gain. In natural conditions there seems always to have been some\r\nleguminous vegetation growing; the gain may, therefore, be ascribed\r\nto the activity of the nodule organism. In pot experiments, however,\r\nit has been found possible, by adding sugar to the soil, to obtain\r\ngains of nitrogen where there is no leguminous vegetation, and this is\r\nattributed to the activity of Azotobacter.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogen cycle as observed in the soil is as follows:--\r\n\r\n            +--------------→ Protein ←----------------+\r\n            |                 ·   ·                   |\r\n            |               ·       ·                 |\r\n            |             ·           ·               |\r\n  By certain|           ·               ·             |\r\n  organisms |           |               |             |By Azotobacter,\r\n  and by    |           ↓               |             |Clostridium,\r\n  growing   |        Ammonia            | Mechanism   |nodule organisms,\r\n  plants    |           |               | uncertain   |etc.\r\n            |           ↓               |             |\r\n            |        Nitrite            |             |\r\n            |           |               ↓             |\r\n            |           ↓            Gaseous          |\r\n            +------- Nitrate ------→ Nitrogen --------+\r\n\r\n                     By denitrifying organisms\r\n\r\nThere has been but little study of the process of decomposition of the\r\nother compounds in plants. Part, if not all, of the sulphur is known\r\nto appear as sulphate, and some of the phosphorus as phosphate. It is\r\ncertain that the plant constituents decompose, for there is no sign of\r\ntheir accumulation in the soil. They may exert transitory effects, but\r\nthere is nothing to show permanent continuance. The toxic conditions\r\nwhich cause trouble in working with pure cultures of organisms in\r\nspecific cultures media do not, so far as is known, arise in the soil.\r\nAll attempts to find bacterio-toxins or plant toxins in normal soils\r\nhave failed. The product toxic to one organism seems to be a useful\r\nnutrient to another, and so the mixed population keeps the soil healthy\r\nfor all its members.\r\n\r\nThere is little precise knowledge as to the part played by the\r\ndifferent members of the soil population in bringing about these\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nWe know in a general way that earthworms effect the distribution of\r\nthe plant residues in the soil, and serve to disintegrate them; there\r\nis no evidence, however, that they play any indispensable part in the\r\ndecomposition. Many root and other fragments do not go through this\r\nprocess; observation shows that fungi can force a way in, and they may\r\nbe followed by nematodes which continue the disintegration. Possibly\r\nsome of the flagellates help, and certainly the bacteria do. After that\r\nnothing is certain. We cannot, with certainty, assign any particular\r\nreaction in the decomposition to any specific organism, with the\r\nexception of the oxidation of the phenolic substances, the conversion\r\nof ammonia to nitrite and nitrate, and the fixation of nitrogen. With\r\nthese exceptions many organisms seem capable of bringing about the\r\nreactions, and indeed some of the reactions may be purely chemical and\r\nindependent of biological agencies.\r\n\r\nThe relationships between the soil population and soil fertility are\r\nreadily stated in general outline, but they are by no means clear cut\r\nwhen one comes to details; fertility is a complex property, and some\r\nof its factors are independent of soil micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nThe general relationship between plants and soil organisms is one of\r\ncomplete mutual interdependence. The growing plant fixes the sun’s\r\nenergy and converts it into a form utilisable by the soil organisms;\r\nwithout the plant they could not exist. The plant is equally dependent\r\non the soil organisms in at least two directions: their scavenging\r\naction removes the dead vegetation which would, if accumulated on the\r\nsurface of the soil, effectively prevent most plants from growing.\r\nFurther, the plant is dependent on the soil population for supplies\r\nof nitrates. Nothing is known about the relative efficiencies of the\r\nvarious soil organisms as scavengers. Numerous fungi and bacteria are\r\neffective producers of ammonia, the precursor of nitrates; it is not\r\nknown, however, whether flagellates and such higher forms as nematodes\r\nact in this way.\r\n\r\nThis widespread power of producing ammonia makes it impossible in our\r\npresent knowledge to regard any particular group of organisms as _par\r\nexcellence_ promoters of fertility. Indeed, it is safest not to attempt\r\nto do so. The primary purpose of the activities of a soil organism\r\nis to obtain energy and cell material for itself; any benefit to the\r\nplant is purely incidental. For cell material it must have nitrogen\r\nand phosphorus; here it competes with the plant. If it produces more\r\nammonia than it utilises--in other words, if it is driven to nitrogen\r\ncompounds for its energy, then the plant benefits. If, on the other\r\nhand, it absorbs more ammonia than it produces, as happens when it\r\nderives its energy from non-nitrogenous substances, the plant suffers.\r\nThus, addition of peptone to the soil or an increase in bacterial\r\nnumbers effected without addition of external energy (e.g. by partial\r\nsterilisation) leads to increased ammonia supply, and, therefore,\r\nto increased fertility. But addition of sugar to the soil causes so\r\ngreat an increase of numbers of bacteria and other organisms that\r\nconsiderable absorption of ammonia and nitrate occurs, and fertility\r\nis for a time depressed.\r\n\r\nBoth actions proceed in soils partially sterilised by organic\r\nsubstances, such as phenol, which are utilised by some of the soil\r\norganisms; there is first a great rise in numbers of these particular\r\norganisms with a depression of ammonia and nitrate, then a drop to the\r\nnew level, higher than the old one, and an increased production of\r\nammonia and nitrate resulting from the partial sterilisation effects.\r\n\r\nWe must then regard the soil population as concerned entirely to\r\nmaintain itself, and only incidently benefiting the plant, sometimes,\r\nindeed, injuring it; always essential, yet always taking its toll, and\r\nsometimes a heavy toll, of the plant nutrients it produces.\r\n\r\nThis effect makes it difficult to deduce simple quantitative\r\nrelationships between bacterial activity and soil fertility, and the\r\ndifficulty is increased by the fact that bacteria and plants may both\r\nbe injured or benefited by the same causes, so that high bacterial\r\nnumbers in a fertile soil would not necessarily be the cause, but might\r\nbe simply the result of fertility.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that certain soil organisms--bacteria, algæ, and\r\nfungi--themselves assimilate ammonia and nitrate may account for\r\nthe remarkable slowness of nitrate accumulation, to which reference\r\nhas already been made. The protein formed from the assimilated\r\nnitrogen remains in the bodies of the organisms, living or dead, till\r\ndecomposition sets in. It is not difficult to picture a cycle of events\r\nin which much of the nitrate formed is at once reabsorbed by other\r\norganisms, and only little is actually thrown off into the soil. Such a\r\nprocess might continue almost interminably so long as any carbonaceous\r\nmaterial remained.\r\n\r\nFinally, we come to the very interesting problem--is it possible to\r\ncontrol the population of the soil?\r\n\r\nThe problem may seem superfluous in view of the difficulties just\r\nmentioned. Some aspects of it, however, are fairly clearly defined.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, some organisms appear to be wholly harmful to\r\nthe plant; among them are parasitic eelworms and fungi, and bacteria\r\ncausing disease.\r\n\r\nControl of these organisms can be brought about by partial\r\nsterilisation, and of all methods heat is the most effective, but it\r\nis costly, and attempts are now being made to replace it by chemical\r\ntreatment. The results are promising, but the investigation is\r\nlaborious; the organisms show specific relationships, and in finding\r\na sufficiently potent and convenient poison it is necessary in each\r\ncase to make an investigation into the relationship between chemical\r\nconstitution and toxicity to the particular organism concerned.\r\nFormaldehyde is usually potent against fungi, and the cresols, and\r\nparticularly their chlor- and chloronitro-derivatives, are potent\r\nagainst animals (eelworms, etc.).\r\n\r\nOne group of organisms is wholly beneficial, those associated with\r\nleguminous plants. Attempts have been made to increase their activities\r\nby inoculating the soil with more vigorous strains. The practical\r\ndifficulties still remain very considerable, but there is hope that\r\nthey may be overcome.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to shift the balance of the soil population in\r\ncertain directions. Special groups of soil organisms can be caused\r\nto multiply temporarily, if not permanently, by satisfying their\r\nparticular requirements. Thus, when a soil has been heated above 100°\r\nC. it becomes specially suited to the growth of fungi, and quite\r\nunsuited to certain bacteria such as the nitrifying organisms and\r\nothers; if this heated soil is infected with a normal soil population\r\nthe fungi develop to a remarkable extent. The nodule organisms appear\r\nto be stimulated by addition of farmyard manure and of phosphates, and\r\nthe phenol-destroying organisms by successive small additions of phenol.\r\n\r\nFinally, quite apart from the control of disease organisms, it is\r\npossible to alter the soil population considerably by partial\r\nsterilisation, using a temperature of only about 60° C., or a poison\r\nlike toluene that favours few of the soil organisms. This problem has\r\nalready been discussed in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nThe control of the soil population is still only in its infancy, but\r\nit already promises useful developments. It cannot, however, be too\r\nstrongly insisted that the only sure basis of control is knowledge, and\r\nwe cannot hope to push control further till we have learned much more\r\nabout the soil population than we know at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADAMETZ, 118.\r\n\r\n  Adams, 158.\r\n\r\n  Aiyer, 113.\r\n\r\n  Appel, 133.\r\n\r\n  Artari, 107.\r\n\r\n  Ashby, 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BARTHEL, 24.\r\n\r\n  Beijerinck, 6, 37, 41, 42, 46, 107.\r\n\r\n  Berthelot, 5, 6, 41.\r\n\r\n  Bewley, 47, 51, 132.\r\n\r\n  Bezssonoff, 69.\r\n\r\n  Boas, 138.\r\n\r\n  Bokorny, 138.\r\n\r\n  Bonazzi, 45.\r\n\r\n  Boresch, 107.\r\n\r\n  Boussingault, 3.\r\n\r\n  Bredemann, 24.\r\n\r\n  Bristol, 106.\r\n\r\n  Brizi, 113.\r\n\r\n  Brown and Halversen, 127.\r\n\r\n  Burgess, 41.\r\n\r\n  Burrill, 48.\r\n\r\n  Bussey, Peters and Ulrich, 132.\r\n\r\n  Butkevitch, 138, 139.\r\n\r\n  Butler, 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAMERON, 150, 158.\r\n\r\n  Chodat, 107.\r\n\r\n  Christensen, 46.\r\n\r\n  Clayton, 28, 43.\r\n\r\n  Coleman, 127, 136.\r\n\r\n  Conn, 23, 54, 61, 123.\r\n\r\n  Cramer, 39.\r\n\r\n  Crump, 57, 79, 80.\r\n\r\n  Cunningham, 69.\r\n\r\n  Cutler, 57, 58, 78, 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DALE, 118, 121.\r\n\r\n  Darwin, 153.\r\n\r\n  Dascewska, 134.\r\n\r\n  De Bruyn, 132.\r\n\r\n  van Delden, 42.\r\n\r\n  Delf, 87.\r\n\r\n  Doryland, 33, 40.\r\n\r\n  Dox, 138.\r\n\r\n  Dox and Neidig, 134.\r\n\r\n  Drummond, 160.\r\n\r\n  Duggar and Davis, 135.\r\n\r\n  Duvaine, 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EHRENBERG, 138.\r\n\r\n  Ehrlich and Jacobsen, 138.\r\n\r\n  Esmarch, 102, 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FABRICIUS, 61.\r\n\r\n  Feilitzen, 61.\r\n\r\n  Fischer, 118, 126.\r\n\r\n  Forte, 101.\r\n\r\n  Frank, 132.\r\n\r\n  Fritsch, 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GAINEY, 46.\r\n\r\n  Gillespie and Hurst, 140.\r\n\r\n  Goddard, 118, 120, 121.\r\n\r\n  Golding, 49.\r\n\r\n  Goodey, 68, 73, 79, 105.\r\n\r\n  Greaves, 42, 61.\r\n\r\n  Green, 37.\r\n\r\n  Grintzesco, 107.\r\n\r\n  Groenewege, 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HAGEM, 118, 121, 136, 138, 139.\r\n\r\n  Hamilton, 158, 159.\r\n\r\n  Hansen, 48.\r\n\r\n  Hanzawa, 43.\r\n\r\n  Harrison, 113.\r\n\r\n  Heinze, 139.\r\n\r\n  Hellriegel, 5, 6, 46.\r\n\r\n  Hensen, 100.\r\n\r\n  Hesselmann, 36.\r\n\r\n  Hill, 94.\r\n\r\n  Hiltner, 23.\r\n\r\n  Hopkins, 36.\r\n\r\n  Hutchinson, C.

The names and classifications of the organisms as used in the\r\n  book do not always conform to modern names and classifications; these\r\n  have not been changed.\r\n\r\n  Depending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all\r\n  elements may display as intended.\r\n\r\n  Page 14, table, lower right hand cell: the data given add up to 8,\r\n  not to 9.\r\n\r\n  Page 47, ·9 × ·18 in size: the source document does not include the\r\n  units; presumably the sizes are in microns.\r\n\r\n  Page 118, endnote 8c (2×): this note does not exist.\r\n\r\n  Subject Index, entry Zygorrhynchus mœlleri: also refers to\r\n  Zygorrhynchus vuilleminii.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made:\r\n\r\n  Footnotes, tables and illustrations have been moved out of text\r\n  paragraphs; some tables have been split or re-arranged.\r\n\r\n  Several minor obvious typographical, punctuation and spelling errors\r\n  (including accents) have been corrected silently. In several cases\r\n  spelling differences (mainly of proper names) between the text and\r\n  the index and endnotes have been standardised. In the indexes and in\r\n  tables some ditto marks have been replaced with the dittoed\r\n  text. Some page references have been corrected to indicate the\r\n  correct page number.\r\n\r\n  Indented text under illustrations is not present as such in the\r\n  source document, but has been transcribed from the illustration for\r\n  legibility and ease of reference. Some tables have been re-arranged\r\n  or split to fit the available width.\r\n\r\n  Page 28, 29: MacBeth changed to McBeth as elsewhere (in the Author\r\n  Index the entries MacBeth and McBeth have been merged).\r\n\r\n  Page 32, formula: 30 changed to 3O.\r\n\r\n  Page 58: From Barnfeild, ... changed to From Barnfield, ....\r\n\r\n  Page 85: closing bracket deleted after ...
