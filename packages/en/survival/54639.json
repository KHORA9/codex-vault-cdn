Spelling of names\r\n     Lamarck and Bruguière standardized, otherwise variations in\r\n     spelling, capitalization and hyphenation retained.\r\n ● “var” is sometimes italicized, other times not. It has been kept as\r\n     printed.\r\n ● Corrections printed in the text as a note to THE BINDER have been\r\n     made. In addition, plates 19 and 20 were reversed in the original.\r\n     These plates have been swapped so that the correct image precedes\r\n     the chapter that discusses it.\r\n ● Missing title text “PLATE VI” added at the start of its chapter.\r\n ● Missing entry for Plate 36 in the Index has been added. “Polita,\r\n     Nerita, var; Pink-Banded Variety of the Thick Polished Nerit 36”\r\n ● There are entries in the Index that don’t seem to correspond to\r\n     specific text in the related plate chapter, but may refer to a\r\n     plant that is in the plate background.\r\n ● The author uses asterisks in varying numbers in front of some\r\n     descriptive text at the beginning of plate chapters. There are also\r\n     a couple of asterisks within the text that appear similar to\r\n     footnote indicators, but a corresponding footnote does not seem to\r\n     exist. These asterisks have been left in the text in their original\r\n     location.\r\n ● Footnotes have been moved to the end of their respective chapters.\r\n ● Italics are indicated by underscores surrounding the _italic text_.\r\n ● Small capitals have been converted to ALL CAPS.\r\n ● Superscript text is represented by a ^ preceding it, e.g. 1.^{st}.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                        NATURALIST’S REPOSITORY,\r\n                                   OR\r\n                           Monthly Miscellany\r\n                                   OF\r\n                        EXOTIC NATURAL HISTORY:\r\n\r\n                              CONSISTING OF\r\n\r\n          ELEGANTLY COLOURED PLATES WITH APPROPRIATE SCIENTIFIC\r\n                         AND GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\n                OF THE MOST CURIOUS, SCARCE, AND BEAUTIFUL\r\n\r\n                          PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE\r\n\r\n                    THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY DISCOVERED\r\n\r\n                      IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD;\r\n\r\n                         AND MORE ESPECIALLY SUCH\r\n\r\n                                NOVELTIES\r\n\r\n As from their extreme Rarity remain entirely undescribed, or which have\r\n           not been duly noticed by any preceding Naturalists.\r\n\r\n                     THE WHOLE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO\r\n          THE LATEST IMPROVEMENTS IN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF\r\n\r\n                               The Science,\r\n\r\n                AND FORMING COLLECTIVELY A TRULY VALUABLE\r\n               COMPENDIUM OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES\r\n                                    OF\r\n               QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, INSECTS, SHELLS,\r\n                           MARINE PRODUCTIONS,\r\n\r\n          AND EVERY OTHER INTERESTING OBJECT OF NATURAL HISTORY,\r\n                     THE PRODUCE OF FOREIGN CLIMATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BY E.

This number, accompanied by the Title Page and\r\nIndex, renders the first volume complete. The Subscribers, therefore,\r\nare now enabled to form a correct idea of the nature and object of the\r\nundertaking: and from the style in which it has been so far conducted,\r\nto form some conclusion of that in which it is likely for the future to\r\nbe continued.\r\n\r\nThe general approbation that has been bestowed already upon this\r\npublication can be best appreciated from the extent of sale, which, to\r\nsay the least, has been respectable from the commencement,\r\nnotwithstanding that the undertaking was began under the manifest\r\ndisadvantage of being little known, and the very knowledge of its\r\nexistence being still in no small degree circumscribed. It is not,\r\ntherefore, without a sense of grateful feeling that the author has\r\nobserved that besides the incidental sale of the different detached or\r\nmonthly parts selected by purchasers desirous of the plates and\r\ndescriptions of some particular object of rarity, that the number of\r\nregular subscribers, instead of diminishing, has rapidly advanced with\r\nthe publication of each number in succession, and as it seems to appear\r\nin proportion as the public became better acquainted with its merits,\r\nand the more assured of its uninterrupted continuance. While this\r\ntestimony of approbation prevails, the author of this undertaking will\r\nbe duly stimulated to exert his best means of rendering it deserving of\r\ntheir consideration. Nor has he any hesitation in believing that it will\r\nbe in his power, under the auspices of public favour, to produce a work\r\nof much elegance, and no mean utility, either as a work of taste for the\r\nlibrary of the general reader, or the admirer of nature; the folios of\r\nthe amateur, or the professed Study of the experienced Naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of this work was necessarily preceded by a few\r\nobservations upon the nature and object of the undertaking: those\r\nobservations are no less appropriate on the present occasion than the\r\nformer, and for this reason we shall again advert to them in restating\r\nthe intention the author has in view. The NATURALIST’S REPOSITORY, or\r\nMONTHLY MISCELLANY OF EXOTIC NATURAL HISTORY, is designed to comprehend\r\nin the most commodious form, a miscellaneous assemblage of elegantly\r\ncoloured plates, with appropriate scientific and general descriptions of\r\nthe most curious, scarce, and beautiful productions of nature that have\r\nbeen recently discovered in various parts of the world or may hereafter\r\noccur to the notice of the author; and more especially of such novelties\r\nas from their extreme rarity remain entirely undescribed, or which have\r\nnot been duly noticed by any preceding Naturalist.\r\n\r\nMost readers, it is presumed, will be aware that the labours of the\r\nauthors life, during a course of many years have been directed to the\r\npursuits of natural science: labours not confined to any one particular\r\nbranch or department of the varied face of nature, but extending\r\ngenerally to the whole. The endeavours of the author to elucidate the\r\nNatural History of the British Isles are sufficiently known from the\r\nvarious extensive works which have been produced by him during the\r\ncourse of the last thirty years, and the magnitude which those works\r\nhave at length acquired in the progressive course of publication that\r\nhad been adopted, is the best criterion of the approbation that has\r\nattended them. But it is not within the views of the author in this\r\nplace to expatiate upon a subject which might be deemed irrelevant, the\r\nworks alluded to being devoted solely to the productions of our native\r\ncountry, while the avowed object of the present undertaking is to\r\ncomprehend a selection of those only which are peculiar to foreign, and\r\nwith few exceptions, to extra European climates. The chief motive of the\r\nauthor in adverting to those works, is to point out a style and mode of\r\nexecution for the present undertaking, which, from the very extensive\r\npatronage those former labours of the author have experienced, may be\r\nconsidered applicable in a very peculiar degree to every purpose of\r\ncorrect elucidation, and as one most likely to ensure by its elegance\r\nand perfection that same proportion of general approbation which the\r\nother productions of the author have obtained.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the means within the author’s power of rendering this\r\nwork deserving of the public notice, either as to the novelty, variety,\r\nrarity, or beauty of the various objects it is destined to embrace, the\r\nauthor must rather trust to the favourable opinion which the world may\r\nentertain in its behalf, from the examples now submitted to\r\nconsideration, than to any preliminary observations he can offer: he\r\nshall only presume respectfully that they are adequate to the purpose,\r\nand calculated to answer every moderate expectation his preliminary\r\nobservations may have excited.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily conceived that the opportunities of the author’s\r\nlife, so assiduously devoted to the Science of Nature, must have enabled\r\nhim to enrich his _port feuilles_ with a collection of DRAWINGS,\r\nMANUSCRIPTS, and MEMORANDA of no mean importance in all its branches.\r\nThis is perfectly correct. His own Museum confined chiefly, but not\r\nexclusively, to the productions of Great Britain, have afforded many\r\nrarities, the offspring of foreign climates, which could not elsewhere\r\nbe procured. But independently of those resources which his own\r\ncollection has afforded, his other means have been amply extensive.\r\nThrough the kindness of his scientific friends, he has had unlimited\r\naccess to many other collections of acknowledged moment, for the purpose\r\nof enriching his Collectanea with drawings and descriptions of the more\r\ninteresting rarities which those cabinets respectively contained. Some\r\nof those collections exist no longer and are probably now forgotten, but\r\nthe memory of others, even among the number of those which have passed\r\naway, will ever be cherished with regret in the mind of every man of\r\nscience by whom their merits were understood. The preservation even of\r\nthe memorials of some minor portion of the rarities which those\r\ncollections once embodied can scarcely fail to prove of interest at the\r\npresent day, while their total loss to the rising generation will be in\r\nsome degree appreciated from the memoranda and occasional references\r\nthat will appear respecting them in the progress of the present work: to\r\nenumerate the many collections of private individuals, the rarities of\r\nwhich have contributed to render this collection of the author’s\r\ndrawings important, would extend our advertisement far beyond our\r\nintended limits. It may be sufficient to observe that the late Leverian\r\nMuseum, rich in every branch of Natural History, has tended in an\r\neminent degree to this effect; the author having been favoured with\r\nunreserved permission to take drawings and memoranda of whatever he\r\ndeemed important, besides having subsequently enriched his own Museum\r\nwith a very ample portion of that fine collection, by public purchase,\r\nat the time of its dispersion; particularly in the different tribes of\r\nthe Mammiferous animals, in Ornithology, Ichthyology, and various\r\nothers; and also with every object materially important among the\r\nextraneous fossils which that splendid museum originally contained. It\r\nwill be also seen from many of our pages that through the kindness of\r\nthe late worthy President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, the\r\nrich and truly scientific collection of that munificent patron of the\r\nsciences was ever open to us for the furtherance of our pursuits in\r\nNatural History; and of the object of the present work among others. The\r\ncollections of Mr. Drury, and also that of Mr. Francillon, in the\r\nparticular branches of Entomology, are too considerable to be passed\r\nslightly over: the rarities of both these collections have in an eminent\r\ndegree improved our means of rendering this work important. And lastly\r\nwe may mention among other scientific acquisitions the Collectanea of\r\ndrawings formed by the pencil of the late Mr. Jones of Chelsea, together\r\nwith the manuscripts of Fabricius in elucidation, as a treasure which\r\ncannot be too highly appreciated when we recollect the importance of the\r\nFabrician writings on the continent, and remember also that those\r\ndrawings afford the only illustration of the most splendid portion of\r\nthe insect race which that author exclusively describes, and by which\r\nvery many of the species can alone be now determined.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of these remarks it may be observed, however, that while\r\nin our elucidation of those rarities which the collections and museums\r\nabove adverted to have so amply afforded, we render a deserved tribute\r\nof record to the liberality of those whose services in the cause of\r\nNatural History have so amply contributed to its advancement in former\r\ndays, the author will not remain unmindful of those advantages which the\r\nmany valuable collections of the present period offer. It will appear as\r\nthis work proceeds that he is in no small degree indebted to the favor\r\nof many eminent scientific characters of our time, as well as those who\r\nhave preceded them, for their permission to take drawings and\r\ndescriptions of such rarities in their collections as really appear\r\nworthy of distinct consideration. And it may be added finally that he\r\nshall at all times avail himself with pleasure, and acknowledge with\r\nthanks, any further advantages of the same kind which the favours of\r\nothers may be induced to allow for the purpose of enriching the present\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n      LAMBETH,\r\n _March 1st, 1823_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Table of Contents.\r\n\r\n                           ALPHABETICAL INDEX\r\n                                   TO\r\n                                VOL.

The study of Shells prevailed, at least to some\r\nextent, in those early times when the generality of mankind believe the\r\nworld to have been buried in the depths of ignorance. At periods, even\r\nwhen some among those of better information may be inclined to imagine\r\nthat the ancients could have had no very accurate conceptions of the\r\nnature of these bodies, or of their classification, natural or\r\nartificial, and even when it might be supposed from the warlike temper\r\nof the age the collecting of shells would have been deemed an unworthy\r\noccupation, we discover sufficient indications to prove that their\r\nleisure hours were so employed. The productions of the sea were\r\ndelineated in their manuscripts; Pliny speaks of the delight the artist\r\ntook in painting the asterias, or sea stars. The spontaneous offerings\r\nof the ocean were depicted in their natural colours upon the walls of\r\ntheir dwellings, abundant evidence of which appears among the ancient\r\npaintings of Herculaneum and Pompeii; and that the shells themselves\r\nwere sometimes collected by the ancients is placed beyond a doubt from\r\nthose remains which have been found, at various times, among the relics\r\nof those celebrated ruins, and also among the ruins of the Roman town,\r\nperhaps no less ancient, denominated La Scava.\r\n\r\nIt is declared by Pliny, in the ninth book of his Natural History, that\r\nthe Romans of his time were better acquainted with the productions of\r\nthe sea than the animals of the land, a circumstance he attributes, and\r\nunquestionably with sufficient reason, to the extravagant excess to\r\nwhich the luxurious taste of those times was carried. This will excite\r\nthe less surprise when we recollect the various useful results deduced\r\nfrom this investigation. Of these we have several very memorable\r\nexamples; the exquisite dyes of green, the scarlet, and the imperial\r\npurple, which they possessed and prized so eminently, were all the\r\nproduce of testaceous bodies. And so likewise the pearls gathered from\r\nthe various perlaceous bivalve shells; and pearls we are assured were in\r\nthose days valued at Rome, as in Egypt, at a price infinitely beyond\r\nthat of gold and gems, the diamond alone excepted.\r\n\r\nPliny tells us, that, in his time, after the diamonds of India and\r\nArabia, pearls were esteemed most precious, and that we may be under no\r\nerror as to the application of the text to the pearls found in shells,\r\nhe further adds, that he had before spoken of these pearls in his book\r\nthat treats upon the productions of the sea[1]. The diamonds in those\r\ntimes were so scarce, and esteemed so highly, as to be little known,\r\nexcept among princes, the smaller and most inferior kinds alone\r\nexcepted. The pearls were the most costly jewels employed in the\r\nornaments for the ears, the neck, and fingers of the fair sex, and the\r\nshells themselves were converted into various articles of finery for\r\ntheir wardrobe and furniture.\r\n\r\nBut it is not, as before observed, within our province in this place, to\r\nenter into any such latitude of explanation as an ample illustration of\r\nthese remarks may be conceived to merit. It is our object only to\r\nexpress ourselves in general terms: it may be sufficient therefore to\r\nobserve, that among the luxuries of the great in the times of Pliny,\r\nOppian, and Juvenal, it is certain they indulged their peculiar taste in\r\nthe study of these productions of the deep. They not only amassed\r\ntogether the more curious among those shells whose beauty attracted\r\ntheir regard, they entered also to some extent into their history and\r\nmanners, and were sufficiently informed as to their natural properties\r\nto render them subservient to the general purposes of luxury and life.\r\nThey knew the distinctions between the land, the fresh-water, and the\r\nmarine tribes of shells, and they proceeded with minuteness and\r\nsometimes fully into their history. No classic reader of the Halieutics\r\nof Oppian will doubt the general acquaintance of the ancients with those\r\nbeings in their native element, nor will any one imagine, who is\r\nconversant with the lives of the philosophers of the infant ages of the\r\nworld, that the study of Conchology, even as a science, was unknown. So\r\nmany writings of the ancients, even of the classic ages of Greece and\r\nRome, have disappeared, that it may be now impossible to form any very\r\naccurate conclusions, at the same time that enough remains to justify\r\nour persuasion that it was far from inconsiderable. Among others, the\r\nworks of Aristotle, the preceptor of the Macedonian conqueror Alexander,\r\nhave survived the ravages of time, and very happily, for the history of\r\nhuman knowledge unfolds to us the views which the ancients had then\r\ntaken of natural science, and among the rest of the science of\r\nConchology; and there is, moreover, every reason to believe that in the\r\nclassification of the testaceous tribes, or shells, which the writings\r\nof this philosopher present us, we, in reality, possess the arrangement\r\nof the shells composing the Conchological collection of that most potent\r\nmonarch, the conqueror of the world:—the classical distribution of the\r\nshells of the great Alexander, as they were disposed by the most\r\ncelebrated naturalist of his age, and at a period more remote than three\r\ncenturies before the commencement of the Christian æra.\r\n\r\nThe Science of Conchology, like that of all other branches of nature,\r\nhas undergone its mutations at various periods. Generally, it has held a\r\nrank of some eminence, a circumstance attributable no doubt to the\r\npeculiar beauty of this interesting tribe. In speaking of the latter\r\ntimes, the period of the last and preceding centuries, it would be\r\ndifficult to determine in which country of civilized Europe the science\r\nof Conchology has been most esteemed; at one time, the virtuosi of\r\nHolland, at another of France, and latterly of Britain, have endeavoured\r\nto produce the most extensive and costly cabinets of Conchology, and\r\neach in consequence may perhaps have excelled alternately; nor were\r\nother countries of Europe in this respect less emulous, or materially\r\ndeficient in the number and excellence of their collections in this\r\ndepartment of nature, during the same periods.\r\n\r\nWe have been unavoidably led into this train of digression and remark\r\nfrom a due consideration of the very interesting history connected with\r\nthe shells which form the subject of the annexed Plate, the particulars\r\nof which, it is presumed, will be found to justify the general tendency\r\nof these observations, and these remarks may be considered also as a\r\nprelude to the introduction of many others among the number of those\r\nrarities which it is within our contemplation to produce progressively\r\nin the course of the present work; shells, to which the prevalence of\r\ngeneral taste has assigned a value and importance scarcely less\r\nconsiderable than the nonpareil cones, or the eminently celebrated cedo\r\nnulli.\r\n\r\nThe first shell in the plate before us that invites attention from its\r\nmagnitude is that superb cone delineated at figure I. This shell, which\r\nonce held a distinguished place in the Leverian Museum, is two inches\r\nand six-eighths in length, its greatest breadth one inch and\r\nthree-eighths. The general colour pale yellowish, with two bands of\r\nchesnut, marked with irregular arrow-headed spots of white, and an\r\nintermediate narrow band composed of white spots of the same form, each\r\nconnected by means of an intervening dot of chesnut, which, together,\r\nform a catenated band of peculiar elegance. When very closely examined\r\nwith the aid of a magnifier, the whole surface of the shell appears\r\nfinely reticulated with yellow.\r\n\r\nThis shell was sold in one of the latter day’s sale of the Leverian\r\nMuseum for the sum of five guineas and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FIGURE II.\r\n\r\n                   CONUS AMMIRALIS var AMBOINENSIS β.\r\n\r\n                     SIX-BANDED AMBOYNA HIGH-SPIRED\r\n                             ADMIRAL SHELL.\r\n\r\nSpire high and tapering; shell subpyriform; smooth, pale yellowish,\r\nsprinkled with fulvous; body-wreath with six bands, the three uppermost\r\nlinear, and composed of alternate white and chesnut-coloured dots, the\r\nthree lower of two broad castaneous bands, marked with subsaggitate oval\r\nspots, and an intermediate narrow belt of alternate brown and white\r\ndots.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis shell, like the former, (fig. I) constituted part of the Leverian\r\ncollection of exotic shells. Its length is an inch and half, its\r\ngreatest breadth exceeding five-eighths of an inch.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the inferiority of its size, this very elegant and\r\ncurious shell is not less interesting than the preceding. The general\r\ntints in both are nearly the same, but in the present shell are rather\r\ndeeper, the dots of fulvous brighter and more thickly sprinkled, and the\r\nbands more numerous. Like the former shell it has two broad bands of\r\nbrown, checquered with subovate spots of white, and an intermediate\r\ndotted line, but these are placed rather nearer towards the narrower end\r\nof the shell, and the intervening space between the spire and the larger\r\nband, encompassed or girt round with two other linear bands, composed of\r\nwhite and brown dots, besides another still more conspicuous, and\r\ncomposed of larger spots along the base or body-wreath, contiguous to\r\nthe spire or turban.\r\n\r\nThis little shell may be considered as affording an excellent type of\r\none of the rarer kinds of Conus Ammiralis, the variety denominated the\r\nSix-banded high-spired Admiral Cone. During a period of some years that\r\nhave now elapsed since the dispersion of that collection, no other\r\nexample of this variety has occurred to our observation more perfect and\r\ncharacteristic in all its markings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FIGURE III.\r\n\r\n                   CONUS AMMIRALIS var CEDO NULLI α.\r\n\r\n                      OLIVE-BANDED NONPAREIL CONE.\r\n\r\nSpire high and tapering; marbled white, fulvous, and dusky; body-wreath\r\nwith three subolivaceous bands, the broadest towards the spire, with\r\nfour belts of whitish dots; the two others towards the narrow end each\r\nwith a single row of dots.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf in the preceding instances we have produced some novelties worthy of\r\nparticular attention, the present shell, in point of value as well as\r\nbeauty, must also lay a distinguished claim to our consideration. This\r\nis one of those rare varieties of Conus Ammiralis denominated the CEDO\r\nNULLI, or CEDO NULLI _pretiossissimus_, in allusion to the incomparable\r\nvalue affixed to the varieties of this peculiar species. The importance\r\nattached to the shells of this kind may indeed be best conceived by\r\nstating that some of its varieties have been valued at twenty, fifty,\r\nand one hundred guineas; one, in almost every respect resembling that\r\ndelineated at figure 4, the celebrated Cedo Nulli of Lyonet’s cabinet,\r\nwas valued by Lyonet himself, about the year 1732, at three hundred\r\nguineas; and either this shell, or another very similar to it, actually\r\nrealized a sum of 1200 florins.\r\n\r\nAs the shells of this kind may very justly be presumed to be of the\r\nfirst rarity, every trait of information that may appear calculated to\r\nelucidate their history, it is presumed, will not only be permitted but\r\nbe deemed acceptable, and under this impression the ensuing observations\r\nare submitted.\r\n\r\nMuch about the æra of the first explosion of the French Revolution of\r\n1789, and within the space of a few years after, it is perfectly well\r\nknown that many of the choicest cabinets and collections of rarities\r\nthat had before been the pride of France and Holland were consigned to\r\nthis country for the sake of safety, and being in some instances\r\nafterwards dispersed, had tended, in no small degree, to enrich the\r\ncabinets of our own country. It was at this period that many very rare\r\nshells occurred to our observation which have since disappeared, and\r\namong others, several of those varieties of Cedo nulli which had been\r\nbefore held in other parts of Europe in considerable estimation. In the\r\nyear 1797 we saw no less than five specimens of this rare shell, all\r\nvarying a little from each other, in the cabinet of the French Minister\r\nof State, M. de Calonne; in one, the colour was pale, in another deeper,\r\none was lineated, and another distinguished by having three distinct\r\nbands.\r\n\r\nAt the dispersion of the Calonnian Museum, which took place by public\r\nsale rather more than twenty years ago, the series of these valuable\r\nshells passed into the fine collection of the present Earl Tankerville,\r\na collection his lordship was then forming for the pleasure of an\r\namiable and beloved daughter since deceased, and these shells are still\r\nconsidered among the more choice rarities of that valuable cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe shell, however, more immediately under our consideration, the\r\nvariety, delineated at figure 3, is from another source; it was among\r\nthe spoils of rarities sent over to this country from Holland, at the\r\ntime of the insurrection connected with the first inroads of the French\r\ninto that country. The shell passed into the hands of a merchant of\r\ncuriosities in London, and being afterwards sold, its destination is\r\nuncertain; the price affixed was twenty guineas.\r\n\r\nThis shell corresponded very nearly with the variety denominated Seba’s\r\nCedo nulli, having once formed a part of the museum of the celebrated\r\nSeba, but it could not be the same, because the entire collection of\r\nSeba, which at the period of the French invasion constituted part of the\r\nRoyal Museum of the Stadtholder, was carried into France and its\r\ncontents distributed among the other objects of natural history in the\r\nFrench Museum[2]. The description which Favanne has left us of the CEDO\r\nNULLI DE SEBA is in the following words, and will be found on a near\r\ncomparison to accord pretty accurately with our present shell:—“_Le Cedo\r\nnulli_ de Seba, à large bande citron foncé, chargée de quatre\r\ncordelettes de grains inégaux, blancs, bleus, rouges et orangés. Le\r\nreste de sa robe est fascié et marbré d’orangé-brun, de jaune, de rouge\r\net bleu-pâle sur un fond blanc avec deux bandes grenues vers le bas.”\r\n\r\n                                                 FAVANNE, t. ii. p. 422.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FIGURE IV.\r\n\r\n                   CONUS AMMIRALIS var CEDO NULLI β.\r\n\r\n                        FULVOUS NONPAREIL CONE.\r\n\r\nSpire high and tapering, fulvous reddish and orange, varied and marbled\r\nwith white; two orange bands, each with four belts of white dots, and a\r\nsingle series near the tip.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shell from which this drawing is taken fell also into the possession\r\nof the same individual as the last, and much about same period. This\r\nrarity was disposed of, as I have been informed, at a price exceeding\r\nthat of the former, and passed shortly after, I believe, into the\r\nImperial cabinet, at Vienna, or otherwise into one of the continental\r\ncabinets in the north of Europe, a circumstance we have not, at this\r\ndistant period, any means whatever of determining.\r\n\r\nThe accordance between this shell and the celebrated Cedo nulli of\r\nLyonet’s cabinet, which, as before intimated, was estimated at the value\r\nof three hundred guineas, will not escape the remark those who are\r\nacquainted with the description of Lyonet’s shell. According to Favanne\r\nthere were two or more varieties of the Cedo nulli, in his time, in\r\nFrance, that bore a very near resemblance to the shell of Lyonet; he\r\nspeaks of one in the cabinet of Madame La Presidente de Bandeville,\r\nwhich differed in its marbling of white: in being larger and more\r\nprolonged upon the top of the first whorl, ather larger, and interrupted\r\nwith veins of orange, and the last of the two belts of white spots which\r\nfollows this zone near the bottom of the first whorl, composed of rather\r\nlarger spots; with these exceptions the two shells were precisely the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe Cedo nulli of Lyonet is described as being of a yellowish colour,\r\ndivided into bands, the lower one and that in the middle marbled with\r\nwhite, the other two marked, the one with four little belts with white\r\ndots, the second with only three[3].\r\n\r\nI ought not to close these remarks without observing, that these shells\r\nvary so considerably that no two specimens have yet occurred that agree\r\nprecisely with each other. Some approach also, but are clouded instead\r\nof banded; these are the French Cedo nulli graphique, Conus mappa of\r\nSolander, and being held in less esteem from having their colours\r\ndisposed in clouds instead of bands, have obtained the name of the false\r\nCedo nulli. The transitions of these shells, it must be confessed are so\r\nvarious as to render it extremely difficult, if not unsafe, to determine\r\nwhere one species ends and another commences, the difference in the\r\ncolours affords no sufficient data, neither is the form of the shell,\r\nnor the height of the spire so uniformly certain as to constitute a\r\nprecise criterion.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, in his description of the conchological cabinet of her majesty\r\n_Ludovica Ulrica_, the Queen of Sweden*, speaks of three different\r\nvarieties of Conus Ammiralis α _Ammiralis summus_, β _Ammiralis\r\nordinarius_, γ _Ammiralis occidentalis_, and these are again recited in\r\nhis Systema Natura. But it will be seen from the last edition of that\r\nwork, by Professor Gmelin, that the varieties discovered subsequently to\r\nthe age of that inestimable naturalist are very considerable, amounting\r\nto no less than thirty different kinds, and these do not include the\r\nwhole at present known. Gmelin, it should be added, admits only two or\r\nthree kinds as the true CEDO NULLI, which he characterizes essentially\r\nas being encompassed with dotted articulated belts, Cedo nulli cingulis\r\npunctato-articulatis; one he describes as being yellow, painted with\r\nred, and marked with eleven distinct belts of milk white; another,\r\norange with crouded elevated interrupted chesnut lines.\r\n\r\nThese shells inhabit chiefly the South American Seas; the true Cedo\r\nnulli, as it is called, has been found at Grenada. Some of the varieties\r\nof Conus Ammiralis, are not very uncommon, and are in infinitely less\r\nesteem than others; for, as it has already appeared, it is in proportion\r\nto their rarity in addition to some peculiarity in the colours and\r\nmarkings, and most especially in their disposition into the form of\r\nbands, that taste and fancy has affixed a value so considerable as that\r\nwhich these shells are sometimes known to bear.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  (Adamas.) “Proximum apud nos Indicis Arabicisque margaritis pretium\r\n  est, de quibus in nono diximus volumine inter res marinas.” _Plin.\r\n  Hist.

The\r\nlegs are feathered to the toes, and with the toes and claws are of a\r\npale brown.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the head and neck of this species is black, very richly\r\nglossed with blue, which appears, in different directions of the light,\r\nhighly splendid upon its surface. Upon the crown of the head the blue\r\nverges into violet and purple, and in descending towards the neck\r\nbecomes changeable into a fine green, glossed with gold; these brilliant\r\nhues appear also on the sides of the neck, and passing round as a kind\r\nof pectorial band forms in particular a rich zone of golden green upon\r\nthe breast.\r\n\r\nThe pale ashen hue of the bill is singularly contrasted with the deep\r\nblack and violet of the head and neck, and the sudden transition of the\r\ncolours of the body is no less remarkable, the plumage in this part\r\nbecoming abruptly of a fine yellow from the breast down to the thighs;\r\nthese latter are black, but the vent feathers beyond are of a fine\r\nyellow, like the colour of the abdomen. The upper parts of the body are\r\ngreen glossed with yellowish and partaking of a golden lustre. The upper\r\nwing coverts and scapulars are dark fuscous, mottled with greyish; the\r\nquill feathers dark brown, quills from the base to the middle white. The\r\ntail is cuneated or wedge-formed, the middle feathers being longer than\r\nthe outer ones. These feathers are most singularly contrasted with the\r\nrest, being of a fine dark green, glossed with gold, and at the tip\r\nblack, while the three outer feathers on the contrary are white, and\r\nfrom the base downwards nearly to the tip very elegantly marked with\r\noblique indented bars of black, leaving the tip of each feather\r\nimmaculate; the inner one of these three exterior feathers are the same\r\nlength as the dark ones, but the next outer feather is shorter, and the\r\nextreme exterior feather on each side shorter than the latter.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of this bird in which the belly, instead of being\r\nyellow, is white; the whole bird is a trifle smaller than the example\r\nnow before us, and may possibly prove hereafter to be the same species,\r\nin a less mature state of plumage. Buffon calls it _Le Couroucou verd_.\r\n\r\nAll the birds of this tribe at present known are inhabitants of the\r\nwarmer climates of South America and India. Our present subject is a\r\nnative of Cayenne, where it lives in damp and retired woods, building\r\nupon the lower branches of trees and feeding chiefly upon insects, with\r\nwhich the trees and herbage in those countries abound.\r\n\r\nThis truly interesting and very beautiful species is already known in\r\nour language by the epithet of the yellow-bellied Trogon or Curucui.\r\nThere is, however, another bird of the same genus, which has the belly\r\nyellow, as in the present bird; we allude to the Rufous Curucui, the\r\nbetter therefore to define our species we have denominated it the\r\nyellow-bellied Green Trogon, or Curucui, as the least attention to the\r\ndifference in the general colour of the plumage will thus enable the\r\nmost cursory observer to discriminate the two species with facility and\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _3_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The insect with expanded\r\nwings displayed in a flying position in the lower part of the plate\r\nexemplifies this aspect of the upper surface. The lower surface is much\r\nmore beautiful; the marks and colours on the anterior pair possess\r\nnearly the same character as those of the upper surface; the posterior\r\npair are very different, being marked with large annular bands of bright\r\nyellow upon a fuscous ground, and inclosing a number of distinct spots\r\nof cœrulean blue, which in beauty emulate the brilliancy of the finest\r\nultra marine: three of these blue spots are placed in the dark ground\r\nupon the disk, the remainder are disposed in a semi-circle upon a band\r\nof black towards the posterior extremity of the wings. This appearance\r\nis best perceived when the insect appears in a resting position as it is\r\nseen on one of the branches of the mimosa in the upper part of the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nThis insect is a native of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FIGURE II.\r\n\r\n                            PAPILIO PYRAMUS.\r\n                           PYRAMUS BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\n                                 ORDER\r\n                              LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nAntennæ thicker towards the tip, and generally terminating in a knob;\r\nwings erect when at rest.

In return for this assistance, Fabricius affixed to\r\neach of those insects the names under which they were destined\r\nafterwards to appear before the world, a circumstance that may explain\r\nsufficiently the frequent references of the Fabrician writings to those\r\ndrawings, first in his _Species Insectorum_, and subsequently in his\r\n_Entomologia Systematica_. It may be further added, that the whole of\r\nthese drawings, together with the manuscripts in the hand-writing of\r\nFabricius were long in our own possession, during the life-time of the\r\nvery amiable proprietor, Mr. Jones, for the very liberal purpose of\r\ncopying and making known to the public whatever might appear likely to\r\nus to promote the interest and advantage of the Science of Nature; and\r\nthat the insect now before us is one of those very rare species copied\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from which the painting of Mr. Jones was taken formed\r\noriginally part of the collection of the lamented Mr. Yates, the\r\ningenious author of an English translation of the Linnæan Fundamenta\r\nEntomologia, that appeared about forty years ago, and who lost his life\r\nby bathing in the river some short time afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere was a variety of this insect, pretty nearly but not exactly\r\naccording with this in the collection of an old and well-known\r\nentomologist, the late Mr. Drury, a figure of which appeared shortly\r\nafter the publication of the Fabrician writings as the true Papilio\r\nPyramus. It was not precisely the same as it appeared to us from an\r\ninspection of the specimen in the cabinet of Mr. Drury. This insect is\r\nto be found represented in the 23rd plate of the third volume of the\r\nExotic Insects of that author, published in the year 1782.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _4_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The length of\r\nthis shell is four inches and one eighth, its greatest breadth two\r\ninches and three eighths; the colour a kind of buff with an olivaceous\r\ntint, and the whole surface traversed with a number of irregularly\r\nundulated or zig-zag lines of dark brown, disposed longitudinally\r\nthroughout: the peculiar character of which will be conceived more\r\nreadily from the delineation than from any explanation that can be\r\nconveyed by words. These longitudinal lines are numerous upon the back\r\nor superior surface of the first wreath of the shell, and extends also\r\non the lower surface as far as the dilated space of the columella or\r\npillar lip; which latter is of a pure white and destitute of any\r\nmarkings. The mouth or aperture with the interior of the shell is also\r\nwhite, and the plaits of the pillar, which constitutes one of the most\r\nessential characters of the genus Volute, are prominent and well\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nThis species of Voluta has long retained its reputation as a shell of\r\ndistinguished rarity; it was very rare in the time of Kircher and\r\nBonanni, and it has continued scarce even to the present period. At the\r\nsale of the Leverian collection, the example of which the delineation is\r\nnow before us, produced the sum of five guineas and a half: since that\r\ntime other specimens of the same species have occurred occasionally to\r\nobservation, but which have still maintained an equal price in\r\nproportion to their excellence or perfection. The Leverian shell was a\r\nmost select example, and has not been surpassed in point of beauty by\r\nany of the specimens we have since seen. At the dissolution of that\r\ninestimable museum, which happened in the year 1806, this admirable\r\nshell passed into the possession of the worthy secretary of the Linnæan\r\nSociety, A. Mc. Leay, Esq. and it still constitutes a part of the fine\r\nConchological collection of that very eminent naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Solander, as it appears from his manuscripts preserved in\r\nthe library of the late worthy President of the Royal Society, Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, Bart. had designated this kind of Voluta by the name of\r\nNobilis; it is a fine shell and not unworthy of that distinguished\r\nappellation. It is however certain, that it is no other than a variety\r\nof Voluta Scapha of the Linnæan school[4], and as the changing and\r\ntransposition of names that are sufficiently explicit and well\r\nunderstood can only tend to create confusion instead of aiding the\r\npursuits of science, we can have no hesitation in retaining it under its\r\nformer designation. As a variety, we admit this shell to be distinct and\r\nwell defined, and to be so far prominent as to merit a definitive\r\nappellation; and it is under this persuasion the term Nobilis, assigned\r\nbut by Dr. Solander, is subjoined to the specific name Voluta Scapha.\r\n\r\nThis very rare kind of Voluta Scapha is from China, the variety more\r\ncoarse in its general appearance that constitutes the type of this\r\nspecies, is a native of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nAmong the older definitions by which this shell was known among the\r\nearly writers, we may mention that of the learned Kircher, whose museum\r\nof curiosities, extant in the beginning of the last century, contained a\r\nshell of this kind, which Bonanni thus describes:—“_Conchylium ea parte\r\nlatius qua in turbinem desinit sine aculeis, et tuberculis, foramen non\r\nrotundum, ut in Purpura et Buccina, sed longum._” Musaei Kircheriani.\r\nclassis iii. 10. 450. et Bonan. 113.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to observe, in conclusion, that amidst all the\r\nimprovements which modern naturalists have made in the science of\r\nConchology, Voluta Scapha still remains a Volute among the most approved\r\nwriters of the present day, while most of those species considered by\r\nLinnæus as appertaining to the same genus are removed to other\r\nnewly-constituted genera.\r\n\r\nThe character of the true Volute, as it is at present laid down,\r\nconsists in the shell being of an oval form, more or less ventricose, or\r\nswollen, the summit obtuse and ending in a kind of papilla, or teat, the\r\nbase of the shell cut off or somewhat truncated: without canal, and the\r\npillar charged with plaits or folds, of which the inferior ones are the\r\nlargest and longest. The precise contrary of this is observable in the\r\nnew genus MITRA, of which _Voluta Episcopalis_ is considered as the\r\ntype. In this last mentioned shell, the body instead of being ventricose\r\nis subfusiform, the spire pointed at the summit, and the lower plaits\r\nupon the pillar smaller instead of larger. The contrast between these\r\ntwo tribes will, it is conceived, sufficiently illustrate the\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities of the genus Volute, as it is at present\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  This shell, though sufficiently intelligible among the figures of\r\n  Kircher’s shells, engraved and published by Bonanni, and also in the\r\n  works of Lister and some others, escaped the notice of Linnæus. So\r\n  late as the tenth edition of Systema Natura it does not appear. Gmelin\r\n  describes this shell with much accuracy in his edition of the last\r\n  mentioned work, under the specific name of Scapha.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _5_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Natives of\r\nthe warmer climates of the globe: of countries where the fervour of a\r\ntropic sun calls forth the spontaneous productions of the earth bedecked\r\nin gaiety unexampled in other regions of the earth, these little beings\r\nseem to participate in all its genial influence. With forms the most\r\npleasing for symmetry and elegance they combine a brilliancy of colours\r\nthe most splendid; their golden hues, their sapphirine tints, the lustre\r\nof the emerald, the ruby, garnet, amethyst, and topaz, with which their\r\nplumage is adorned, is not surpassed in brightness by the valued gems\r\nwhose hues they borrow, and whose splendours emulate; as though, in this\r\nmuch-favoured race we beheld the richest gems of earth inspired with\r\nlife, and endowed with powers of activity and will. The flowers whose\r\nnectareous juices afford them sustenance, are moreover the liveliest and\r\nmost luxuriant among those that adorn the surface of the teeming\r\nearth:—in a word, the Humming-Birds, poised and fluttering upon the\r\nwing, or flitting from flower to flower, in search of food beneath the\r\nfervid illumination of a cloudless tropic sun, present a spectacle of\r\nthe works of nature upon a scale of miniature the most pleasing and most\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nOwing to the slender structure of the bill, the Humming-Birds have some\r\ndifficulty in obtaining their support; the luxuriant fruits of the\r\ntropic world afford them no repast: their bills are much too feeble to\r\npenetrate their rind to derive subsistence from their fluids. It is the\r\nrich juices of the flowers and not the fruits that afford them food; the\r\nfluids which they find secreted in the nectaria of flowers, the nectaria\r\nof those plants in particular which have the flowers long and tubular,\r\nand in which those repositories of mellifluous fluid lie in the bottom\r\nof the corolla are the favourite objects of their resort. About the\r\nflowers of this kind the Humming-Birds are seen hovering like bees, and\r\nlike those industrious creatures extracting at the same time those\r\njuices of the flowers by means of their elongated tongue. The\r\nconstruction of the tongue in this tribe of birds is singular and\r\ndeserving of explicit mention; it consists of two tubular filiform\r\nthreads, which coalesce throughout their whole length, excepting at the\r\ntips, where they are divided, or bifid; this organ, which is remarkable\r\nfor its extreme length, it inserts deeply down into the corolla of the\r\nflowers, and is thus enabled to obtain the nectar nearly in the same\r\nmanner as the insects of the sphinx genus. The Humming-Birds, when on\r\nthe wing, are observed to emit a humming noise, like that of the bee,\r\nand it is apparently from this circumstance that this class of the\r\nfeathered race have derived the appellation of Humming-Birds.\r\n\r\nAs the different species of the Humming-Bird, though uniformly small,\r\nvary much in magnitude, from the bigness indeed of the wren and others\r\nof our smaller warblers to a size more diminutive than several of the\r\nlarger kinds of the bee tribe, the nests of these birds, as may be\r\nconceived, are found to vary materially according to the size of the\r\nspecies to which they appertain. These little local habitations of the\r\ninfant brood are all comparatively small, are usually of a roundish\r\nform, lined with the softest downy leaves, and each in general contains\r\ntwo little eggs, scarcely exceeding the size of peas, and of a pure\r\nwhite colour without any spots.\r\n\r\nThe slenderness of the bill and weakness of the legs in this tribe of\r\nbirds sufficiently demonstrate that they are inadequate to any contests\r\nwith other kinds of the feathered race; they are nevertheless observed\r\namong themselves to be rather of a pugnaceous disposition. Their usual\r\ncontests are for their mates or for the possession of some favourite\r\nflower, and are observed to take place while on the wing. Their mode of\r\nattack is by striking with violence against each other, for they never\r\nattempt to assault each other with their bill and their feet are much\r\ntoo small and feeble for conflict.\r\n\r\nThe species of Humming-Bird now before us is one of the larger kinds,\r\nits length being about six inches from the tip of the bill to the\r\nextremity of the tail, exclusive of the two elongated feathers which\r\nextend beyond the true tail about two inches; the bill is long, slender,\r\nand slightly incurvated, and of a whitish colour with the tip black. The\r\nmost characteristic peculiarity is the large space of topazine or golden\r\ngreen immediately beneath the chin, and which expands over the whole\r\nsurface of the throat. The head is blackish purple, and the same colour\r\ndescending along the sides of the neck passes in a kind of crescent\r\nround the breast, thus constituting an abrupt separation between the\r\nvivid green space of the chin and throat, and the vivid lustre of the\r\nabdomen, which is a fine crimson or ruby colour from the breast nearly\r\nto the vent, where it becomes interspersed with a few white feathers;\r\nthe feathers of the thigh are white also. The back and wing coverts are\r\nbrown with tints and shades of greenish, and glosses of a golden yellow.\r\nThe greater quill feathers are fuscous, the tail coverts are fine green;\r\nthe tail orange, except the two remarkable elongated candal feathers,\r\nwhich are black. The legs pale.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the very decisive character which this species of\r\nHumming-Bird displays, and which considered individually can leave us\r\nlittle reason to distrust its identity as a species, we are not to\r\noverlook the very near approximation of this kind with some others that\r\nare described as specifically different, such as the Sapphire\r\nHumming-Bird, and that distinguished by the appellation of the Sapphire\r\nand Emerald Humming-Bird. The near approach of these and some others to\r\nthe species now before us appears to be sufficiently obvious to induce a\r\npersuasion that in a less mature state one kind may sometimes have been\r\nmistaken for another, and this becomes the more probable when we\r\nrecollect that the Humming-Birds in general, like many of the larger\r\ntribes of the feathered race, do not arrive at their full perfection of\r\nplumage till the second and more commonly till the third year.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _6_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The upper surface is of a fine yellow with a\r\nsingular subocellate spot or stigma of a reddish brown in the centre of\r\nthe anterior wings, and a series of double spots of the same colour,\r\ndisposed towards the exterior margin both of the anterior and the\r\nposterior pair. The lower surface, as we perceive from the Butterfly at\r\nrest, with the wings erect in the upper part of the plate, is rather\r\nmore of an orange or fulvous hue, and instead of having the disk\r\nimmaculate like the upper surface, except the stigma in the anterior\r\nwings, are sprinkled with reddish brown. The centre of the wings, as\r\nwell the posterior as the anterior pair, are marked with two silver\r\nspots, and which, from their near approximation, may be denominated,\r\naccording to the language of Fabricius, a geminous or double spot of\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThis elegant insect is figured from a specimen in the collection of the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Hunter, the individual example described and referred to\r\nby Fabricius in his _Species Insectorum_ and _Entomologia Systematica_\r\nas expressed among the synonyms above recited.\r\n\r\nThe Papilio Marcellina has appeared already in the costly work of\r\nCramer, upon the Papiliones tribe, we are nevertheless induced to\r\npresent a figure of the species to our readers, in order to point out\r\nthe very close affinity that prevails between this insect and another\r\nmuch more frequent species named Papilio Sennæ. This latter mentioned\r\nButterfly is figured by Sloane, Merian, and Seba; Papilio Marcellina by\r\nCramer only. These insects resemble each other, but are nevertheless\r\ndistinct; the specific character of Papilio Sennæ consists chiefly,\r\naccording to Linnæus, in having the double spot in the centre of each\r\nwing of a ferruginous colour, while in Papilio Marcellina that\r\ncharacteristic mark has the exact appearance of two approximating spots\r\nof molten silver. The tips of the wings in Papilio Sennæ are sometimes\r\nspotted as in Marcellina and are sometimes destitute of spots.\r\n\r\nBoth these analogous species are natives of Surinam; Sloane describes\r\nPapilio Sennæ, in his Natural History of Jamaica, as an inhabitant of\r\nthat island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FIGURE II.\r\n\r\n                             PAPILIO AGAVE.\r\n                            AGAVE BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\n                                 ORDER\r\n                              LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nAntennæ thicker towards the tip, and generally terminating in a knob;\r\nwings erect when at rest.

These are the progressive changes of\r\nthe male bird, and it may be also added, that the female undergoes\r\nseveral mutations of the same kind, as well as the male bird.\r\n\r\nWhen its plumage has attained its full perfection, there are few birds\r\nof more striking beauty than the male of this species. Its size is\r\nscarcely inferior to that of our common Hedge Sparrow, the length\r\nbetween five and six inches. The head and neck of a fine blue purple,\r\nwith a circle of red round the eyes. The whole of the underside,\r\nincluding the chin, throat, breast, and abdomen, is a fulvous, or rather\r\na vivid scarlet; the back green, below which is a space of yellow, and\r\nthe rump scarlet, like the abdomen. The wings are greenish, being shaded\r\nwith brown, and having the edges of the feathers of a delicate green:\r\nthe greater wing coverts in our specimen are of a pale rose colour, and\r\nwhich in the general conformation of the plumage constitutes a roseate\r\nband across the wings. The tail, like the wings, are brownish, having\r\nthe edges of each feather green; the bill and legs dark.\r\n\r\nIn some of the varieties of this bird, occasioned as before observed,\r\nthrough the moulting of the feathers, the blue purple of the head and\r\nneck is more generally extended along the back, and sometimes appears in\r\npatches upon other parts of the plumage. Sometimes, also, the dark spots\r\nthat appear upon the scarlet space of the chin, throat, breast, and\r\nabdomen, are more diffused, and in other states of moulting the abdomen\r\nbecomes yellow or yellowish. The abdomen has also, in some instances,\r\nbeen known to change white, leaving only a rounded spot of red upon the\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\nCatesby describes this species as a native of Carolina. It is an\r\ninhabitant of all the warmer parts of America, extending from Mexico and\r\nPeru, as far as Canada, in the milder seasons of the year. It is rather\r\na hardy bird, insomuch, that some attempts have been made by the Dutch\r\nto naturalize the species in Europe, like the Canary; but not, however,\r\nwith the same success, although they may be kept alive for some time\r\nafter being brought into the less genial climates of the Continent of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Marmaduke Tunstall, Esq. a most indefatigable Naturalist,\r\nwho lived towards the latter part of the preceding century, has stated,\r\nthat two pair of these birds made their nests and laid eggs in the\r\norange trees of a Menagery at Holderness, in Yorkshire, but observes at\r\nthe same time, the eggs were unproductive. Mr. Tunstall, as a Collector,\r\nwas the great rival of Sir Ashton Lever, and of authority\r\nunquestionable, and this circumstance tends to shew that it might be yet\r\npossible to rear these very beautiful birds in this country. Some\r\nauthors have presumed upon the authority of Albin, that this species\r\nextends to China. There can be very little doubt that the figure in the\r\nthird volume of Albin’s plate, denominated the China Bulfinch, is\r\nintended for this bird. Albin assures us that he saw the bird he figured\r\nin the possession of a curious gentlemen, who told him he had received\r\nit from China.\r\n\r\nIn the warmer parts of America, which these birds, as before observed,\r\ninhabit, they occur sometimes in vast flocks; it does not appear that\r\nthey are of a shy or timid disposition, yet it is said they are seldom\r\nseen near habitable places, and never in any considerable numbers\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _8_\r\n\r\n  _London.

At the\r\ndissolution of that Museum, which took place in the month of May, June,\r\nand the beginning of July, in the year 1806, the specimen became the\r\nproperty of a very celebrated amateur, the late Mr. Jennings: he\r\npurchased it at the sale for the sum of seven pounds.[6] Mr. Jennings is\r\nsince dead, and his collection being, like the former, dispersed by\r\npublic sale: we are no longer certain in whose possession this very\r\nbeautiful rarity now remains.\r\n\r\nBesides that this shell excels in magnitude every other known example of\r\nits kind, the formation of the shell itself is extremely fine, its\r\nperfection exquisite, the colouring of the richest and most decided\r\nhues, and the marks and lines throughout, which so eminently\r\ncharacterize the shell, definitely distinct; we shall dwell no further\r\non the peculiar beauty of this shell, from a persuasion that the drawing\r\nwill be found so explicit and so satisfactory, as to render a minute\r\ndescription needless: it was taken with peculiar care, by permission of\r\nits proprietor, while it remained in the Leverian Museum, and will not,\r\nwe are convinced, be found defective in point of accuracy, upon the most\r\nattentive comparison with the original, should that ever be produced in\r\ncompetition with it.\r\n\r\nIn the Linnæan arrangement of Conchology, the shells of this kind\r\nconstitute a species of the Genus Buccinum, the Buccinum Harpa of that\r\nauthor. Previous to the time of Linnæus, the best Conchologists had\r\nconsidered those particular shells that possess the essential characters\r\nof the Common Harp Shell, as a distinct genus. Rumpfius so adopts it\r\nunder the name of Harpa; and Argenville subsequently regarding that\r\nparticular kind called Buccinum Harpa, by Linnæus, as the type of the\r\ngenus, denominates it, by way of eminence, Harpa Nobilis. By some\r\ninconceivable error it has been asserted that Lamarck was the first\r\nauthor who separated the family of Harps from the genus Buccinum; this\r\nis evidently a mistake, as we perceive from Rumpfius and Argenville, and\r\nas we are now proceeding to shew from the “_Catalogue Systématique et\r\nRaisonné_,” of the once celebrated cabinet of M. de Davilla; besides\r\nwhich, some others might be added, were it material to notice them.\r\n\r\nAs we have introduced the subject of Davilla’s Cabinet, it will,\r\nperhaps, afford some pleasure to many of our readers if we mention a few\r\nof those very beautiful varieties of this natural family of the Harps,\r\nwhich were once concentrated in that costly collection. These,\r\ncollectively, appear to have presented a series of the most choice and\r\ninteresting of the varieties at that time known. The distinctions are\r\ntaken from the number of the prominent ridges with which these shells\r\nare longitudinally traversed, and these, it hence appears, varied from\r\nthirteen to fourteen and fifteen in number. One of these, a very fine\r\nshell, and deemed the type of the _Harpe_ tribe, was the Harpa Nobilis\r\nof D’Argenville: it had fifteen ribs, was very regularly marked with\r\nalternate zic-zac lines of brown and white, or rather of brown lines\r\ndisposed upon a white ground, with a small intermediate incurvate line\r\nof grey traversing the middle of each of the white lines, in the same,\r\ndirection as those of brown; a disposition of marking, very similar to\r\nthe zic-zac lineations upon the shell represented in the annexed plate.\r\nThere were two other Harps, in which the number of ribs, or ridges,\r\namounted to no more than fourteen, so that the sides were larger; and\r\nthey were also more inclined than in the preceding. These were marbled,\r\nand marked with streaks and dashes of rose colour, yellow, white, and\r\nchesnut, a large intermediate and rather deeper coloured zone, or band,\r\npassed round the middle of the shell, and two large spots of brown\r\nappeared on the under surface of the shell. There were yet two other\r\nHarps, which differed in their colours and markings from the preceding;\r\none of these had only twelve ribs, or ridges, the other thirteen. The\r\ncolours in one of these were paler, in the other the zic-zac lines, were\r\nmore contiguous, or placed closer, and the longitudinal striæ less\r\ndistinct or prominent. And besides these, there were several others, all\r\nwhich differed in some peculiarities of inferior moment, principally in\r\nthe paleness or intensity of their colours, and variations in the\r\ndisposition of the dark and paler spaces with which the shells were\r\nmarbled.\r\n\r\nThe above series of Davila presents us with a pretty ample elucidation\r\nof the presumed varieties of that beautiful species the Linnæan Buccinum\r\nHarpa. We say, only the presumed varieties, because in the present state\r\nof the Conchological Science there appears to be a very strong\r\npropensity among collectors to increase the number of the species, by\r\nconsidering every trivial variation, or accidental circumstance in the\r\ngrowth of shells, as so many characteristic indications of new species;\r\na disposition that the best Conchologists cannot but disapprove.\r\nExperience teaches us that there is no class of beings in the creation,\r\nin which nature is more sportive, than the testaceous tribes; none in\r\nwhich a greater caution is required in the precise determination of what\r\nare species and what varieties only: and among other local causes the\r\ninfluence of climates in different regions are not the least powerful in\r\nproducing those variations. With the best experience, and the advantage\r\nof many years assiduous application, the Conchologist may be sometimes\r\nin doubt, and hence it is not likely that a slight acquaintance, only,\r\nwith the subject will be found sufficient to enable him to pronounce\r\nwith definitive satisfaction the exact distinction between approximating\r\nspecies and the sportive varieties into which they sometimes divaricate.\r\nThese remarks cannot be more forcibly exemplified than in the series of\r\nthe presumed varieties of the Buccinum Harpa. Some of these are indeed\r\nso very dissimilar as to justify a persuasion that they may be\r\nspecifically distinct, and yet again, these are blended so intimately\r\nwith others, which are confessedly varieties, that it demands the utmost\r\ncaution in pronouncing which are species, and which varieties or\r\ntransitions only. This is the impression under which the best informed\r\nConchologists have ever ventured to define the shells which constitute\r\nthe natural family of the Harps, and may serve to afford us a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the causes of those differences in opinion which so\r\nmanifestly prevail among them.\r\n\r\nIt may not be very generally known, excepting only among Naturalists,\r\nthat the late Dr. Solander had devoted much attention to this intricate\r\nscience: his arrangement of shells was designed as an amendment upon\r\nthat of Linnæus. This arrangement was never made public; it remained in\r\nmanuscript in the library of the late Sir Joseph Banks. From a perusal\r\nof these MSS. it appears that Dr. Solander had conceived the necessity\r\nof a new disposition of the shells comprised in general as varieties of\r\nthis species. Some he allows to remain varieties, while others\r\nconstitute, in his ideas, species nearly analogous, but nevertheless\r\ndistinct. He does not propose the formation of an independant genus of\r\nthe Harp family, nor the removal of those shells from the genus\r\nBuccinum, in which Linnæus places the species Harpa: he proposes only to\r\nassemble together the least equivocal varieties of that shell, together\r\nwith that which he considers as the type of the Linnæan species, the\r\ntrue Harpa Nobilis of preceding authors; and to allow the others to\r\nremain as species distinct from the Linnæan shell. It will be hence\r\nperceived that Dr. Solander’s constitutes several distinct species among\r\nthe number of those Harps, which other writers, and Gmelin among the\r\nrest, regard as varieties only of the common kind. In the manuscripts of\r\nDr. Solander the very beautiful Harp shell now before us stands as a\r\ndistinct species from Buccinum Harpa, under the name of _Buccinum\r\ntestudo_. Some of the French Naturalists have called it _Harpa\r\ntestudinaria_: it was placed under that name, and its synonymous\r\nappellation _L’ecaille de Tortue_ in the once celebrated Museum of Mons.\r\nde Colonne, the French Minister of State, under Louis the XVI: the\r\ndefinitive English name of Tortoiseshell Harp was assigned to it by Mr.\r\nGeorge Humphrey, and from his known authority in the study of shells,\r\nthis variety has been since distinguished among collectors in our\r\ncountry by that appropriate appellation. All these names, it will be\r\nscarcely necessary to add, are devised in allusion to that resemblance\r\nwhich its peculiarly beautiful variegations of colour are conceived to\r\nbear, to those of tortoiseshell, when transparent and exposed to light.\r\n\r\nWe have been at some pains in our endeavours to reconcile our mind to\r\nthe idea of introducing this Tortoiseshell Harp as a species distinct\r\nfrom the Buccinum Harpa, in conformity with the opinion of Dr. Solander.\r\nWe have compared our shell with the acknowledged type of the Linnæan\r\nspecies, with every attention, and are compelled, in truth, to allow,\r\nthat however distinct it may appear upon the first glance of inspection,\r\nwe cannot implicitly accede to the persuasion of its being specifically\r\ndistinct. Placing this remarkable variety with that particular shell,\r\nthe true Buccinum Harpa, the less informed Conchologist would assume as\r\ncertain that the difference existing between the two removed them\r\nsufficiently from each other. Arrange these, however, with those\r\nvarieties and transitions of the Common Harp that approach the nearest\r\nin appearance to both kinds, and we shall then perceive such a close\r\nanalogy, such an intermediate catenation, as will induce a pause, and\r\ncertainly under the impression with which we view them, an idea that\r\nthese variations arise only from local causes, and are not specifical\r\ndistinctions. As a marked and well distinguished variety we have\r\nretained the term _testudo_, which Dr. Solander had assigned to it; but\r\nas a distinctive appellation of it as a variety, and not as a shell\r\naltogether distinct.\r\n\r\nThat it may not be imagined we feel any disposition to object against\r\nthose changes in the Science of Conchology, which the more advanced\r\nstate of our present knowledge may demand, we have no hesitation in\r\nadding that in our own opinion the _Harpa_ family should constitute a\r\nvery distinct tribe from the other Buccini; we believe, also, that had\r\nLinnæus lived to reconsider them, he would have comprehended them\r\ntogether as a genus. The French writers have long since done so. De\r\nMonfort advances that Lamarck was the first who separated the Harps from\r\nthe Linnæan Buccinum. This we have already shewn to be an error.\r\nLamarck’s example in proposing them as a genus in his _Système des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_, published in the year 1801, and his subsequent\r\nobservations in other writings, has tended to establish them as a genus;\r\nhe was not its first proposer.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss, in conclusion, to observe, that Lamarck has taken\r\nfor the type of his genus, the variety figured by Lister, in his\r\nConchology, _tab._ 992 f. 55, the shell which he denominates Harpa\r\nVentricosa. The leading character of his genus consists in the shell\r\nbeing of an oval form, ventricose or swollen, and having the surface\r\nfurnished or beset with longitudinal, parallel, and sharp or acutely\r\nedged ribs. The opening or mouth, oblong, ample, abbreviated or cut off\r\nbelow, and without canal. The pillar, or inner lip, smooth, or without\r\nplaits or tubercles, and terminating in a point at the base. The absence\r\nof a canal is one material character by which the Harpa genus, as thus\r\nlaid down, is to be distinguished from the new genus Trophon, to which,\r\nin some respects, at least, it bears a general resemblance. The\r\ndefinition of the genus by De Montfort is rather different from that of\r\nLamarck: according to De Montfort the shells of this family are globose;\r\nthe first whorl very far surpassing the rest in size, and the spire\r\nobtuse. The mouth is very open. The pillar or inner lip smooth and\r\nrounded. The outer lip bordered by an acutely edged rib or ridge,\r\nrunning paralled to those with which the shell is traversed externally,\r\nand the base cut off. The spire in the true Harpa, according to this\r\nwriter, forms a kind of little domes, one surmounting the other, and the\r\nspire, instead of ending in an acute point, terminates in a small\r\nmammillated knob.\r\n\r\nAll the known varieties of this natural family are inhabitants of the\r\ndeep waters of the sea, and the animal inhabitants appear to have\r\nremained hitherto undescribed. They are confined chiefly to the Indian\r\nSeas. The variety known by the name of Nobilis is a native of Japan;\r\nthere is another found in China, distinguished by the name of Chinensis:\r\nboth these are considered by Dr. Solander as the Buccinum Harpa of\r\nLinnæus: there is one kind found at Ceylon, and another at Madagascar,\r\nwhich are to be esteemed distinct species. The sanguineous Harp, from\r\nthe Coast of Guinea, is the Buccinum pandura of Solander. The Harp,\r\ndistinguished by having a far greater number of elevated ribs than any\r\nof the preceding, is from the seas of the Phillippine Isles, and is\r\ncertainly a distinct species. The very fine variety which constitutes\r\nthe more immediate object of our present illustration, the Tortoiseshell\r\nHarp, is a native of Madagascar: its length is four inches, and its\r\ngreatest breadth two inches and a half.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  “Testa _varicibus_ æqualibus longitudinalibus, &c.” is an incorrect\r\n  reading of Professor Gmelin. If we examine the Linnæan description of\r\n  the Museum of the Queen of Sweden, _Mus. Lud. Ulr._ to which Gmelin\r\n  refers, we shall find it to be as might be naturally expected, “testa\r\n  _costis_ æqualibus;” for it is the ribs, and not for veins that\r\n  Linnæus intended. Linnæus refers to the 10th edition of his Systema\r\n  Naturæ, which is not mentioned by Gmelin, and here we again meet with\r\n  the same reading “testa _costis_ æqualibus, &c.” We have been the more\r\n  explicit in pointing out this error, because we observe that one\r\n  Conchologist, not long since, in the absence, doubtlessly, of the\r\n  moment, has translated literally the Gmelinian text in describing\r\n  Buccinum Harpa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Lot 75 of the 60th day.

The bill and legs of this bird are of a pale flesh colour: the\r\nbody above, together with the wings, of a greyish brown: the lower part\r\nof the back, rump, and whole of the underside, of a delicate azure blue;\r\nthe tail blue, of a somewhat deeper tint, and rather cuneated or\r\nwedge-formed. This is the general appearance of the plumage in both\r\nsexes, excepting, only, that the colours are usually somewhat brighter\r\nin the male than the female bird; and that the male bird is\r\ndistinguished further by having a dark red spot on each side of the\r\nhead, beneath the eyes, a character altogether wanting in the female.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that these birds vary occasionally in the colours\r\nof their plumage, particularly in the cærulean tints of the under\r\nsurface, which sometimes inclines to a pale rufous grey, or to blue\r\nintermixed with rufous grey; and in some instances when the state of\r\nplumage is less mature, the latter colour predominates so entirely on\r\nthe lower surface, that only a transition tint of the azure appears upon\r\nthe breast and abdomen.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was induced to imagine that the two sexes of this bird were\r\ndistinct species, the male he denominated _Fringilla Bengalus_, the\r\nfemale _Fringilla Angolensis_; the male bird, which he happened to\r\ndescribe, having been received from Bengal, the female from Angola. The\r\ntruth is, that this widely diffused species inhabits both these places\r\nin common, with many others in Asia and Africa: in Angola, in\r\nparticular, they appear to be very common.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _11_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The shell so named, formerly\r\nconstituted an object, no less conspicuous than beautiful, among the\r\nConchological productions treasured together in the once celebrated\r\nLeverian Museum. And, as we possessed, through the immediate favour of\r\nthe proprietor of that Museum, John Parkinson, Esq. an unreserved access\r\nto every article in the Museum, for the purpose of delineating the\r\nfigures, or taking the descriptions of whatever we conceived worthy of\r\nsuch observation, it will be naturally imagined the Pink, or Roseate\r\nImperial Sun Trochus, would be esteemed of too much importance to escape\r\nour very particular attention. The dispersion of that once celebrated\r\nRepository of Natural History has long since removed, and probably for\r\never, this exquisite rarity from the eye of public curiosity; nor indeed\r\nis its present destination correctly known; a circumstance, it is\r\npresumed, that cannot fail to enhance the value of a drawing, which we\r\nhave every reason for believing to be the only memorial of this kind the\r\npencil of the Arts have consecrated to the commemoration of the shell:\r\nthe only figure, we are assured, the proprietor ever permitted to be\r\ntaken from it.—Having premised so far, it will not be deemed superfluous\r\nto add, that the outline of the specimen is precisely a fac-simile of\r\nthe shell itself, having been traced round its contour while lying upon\r\nthe paper, and being afterwards finished in colours upon the outlines so\r\nstruck, with every attention an object so estimable was presumed to\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe history of this curious variety of the Imperial Sun Trochus is\r\naltogether interesting, and deserves explicit mention; it is one among\r\nthe number of those rare shells which were discovered by that\r\ndistinguished navigator, Captain Cook, in his voyage round the world. It\r\nwas fished up in the Straits that divide the Island of New Zealand, now\r\ndistinguished after him, by the appellation of Cook’s Straits. Upon the\r\nreturn of Captain Cook to England, he presented Sir Ashton Lever, among\r\nother articles of great curiosity, with this particular shell, the only\r\none of its kind he had found. The Imperial Sun Trochus, of an olivaceous\r\nviolet hue, the shell which constitutes the type of this species, though\r\nvery scarce, occurred occasionally, but this Pink variety only in the\r\nsolitary instance before adverted to: it was drawn up, adhering to the\r\ncable of the ship, from the depth, as it appeared, of sixty fathoms\r\nwater.[7]\r\n\r\nIn the general computation of the value of the various articles in the\r\nMuseum of the late Sir Ashton Lever, submitted to government, previous\r\nto the grant of the Lottery which transferred the possession of that\r\nMuseum from its original founder to the hands of Mr. Parkinson, this\r\nshell was estimated at the value of _one hundred guineas_: and as this\r\nvaluation was arbitrary, that sum was considered as the worth of the\r\nshell while it remained in the Museum. At the final dissolution of this\r\nMuseum, which took place in the months of May, June, and July of the\r\nyear 1806, this shell, like the rest, was submitted to the chance of\r\ntaste or caprice: it was sold on the last day of the sale, for the sum\r\nof twenty three guineas, an amount considerably below its former\r\nvaluation, but sufficient, nevertheless, to shew that its attractions\r\nwere still great in the mind of the connoisseur.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser of this shell was at that time unknown, subsequently,\r\nhowever, the specimen appeared among the property sold at the residence\r\nof the Duke de Bourbon, immediately after the departure of that noblemen\r\nfor France, in the beginning of the year 1815.[8] Dr. Leach has since\r\nthat time informed us that he had given instructions for the purchase of\r\nthis shell for the British Museum: the shell does not, however, appear\r\nin that collection, and the lamented illness of our ingenious friend, is\r\nlikely, for the present, to preclude all further inquiry respecting its\r\nfinal destination.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that this very curious variety of the Imperial Sun\r\nTrochus is known in any of the continental cabinets: the olivaceous\r\nkind, which as before observed, is to be regarded as the type of the\r\nspecies, though esteemed scarce, is to be found in every continental\r\ncabinet of importance. Indeed, the olive kind maintained a very high\r\nreputation and price for many years after the time of Captain Cook, who\r\nbrought several of them to England; from whence those continental\r\ncabinets were, in the first instances, supplied. Since that time the\r\nsame seas have been attentively explored by Admiral Bligh, in the ships\r\nof his Majesty under his command; and through his researches, this\r\nshell, which was once considered of such unusual rarity, has become\r\nrather more common. The Pink, or Roseate variety, the immediate object\r\nof our present illustration, has hitherto, however, escaped all\r\nresearch, and it still remains as it was esteemed originally, after a\r\nlapse of nearly fifty years, not merely scarce, but perfectly unique.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious French writer of the present day, Denys de Montfort, in\r\ndescribing the olivaceous kind, the type, as before remarked, of the\r\npresent species, has paid an appropriate tribute of applause to the\r\nmemory of its original discoverers. “It is,” says he, “to the Voyages of\r\nthe celebrated Captain Cook, and to the researches of the indefatigable\r\nNaturalists who accompanied him, that we owe the knowledge of this fine\r\nand magnificent shell.” “This shell,” he adds, “appears to be exposed to\r\nsuch a swarm of aggressors, that his Mollusca (or animal) must lead a\r\nlife of activity and war: his shelly covering is ploughed, or furrowed,\r\nand pierced by a host of enemies, and he must necessarily employ almost\r\nthe whole of life in repressing their attacks, and in constantly\r\nrepairing the breaches and perforations they occasion, by the exudation\r\nof the nacrous molecules, or fluid, with which nature has furnished him,\r\nin order to preserve the inner coating of his shelly habitation entire.”\r\nSuch is really the appearance of this shell in general; we have seen it\r\nso completely despoiled of its exterior coating by these attacks, as to\r\nrender it impossible to form any tolerable conception of the shell when\r\nperfect; even an approach towards perfection in its outer coating is\r\nvery rare. The most complete of its kind in the collection of the late\r\nAdmiral Bligh, and probably selected as the best he ever met with, was\r\nperfect in this respect than might be expected. By one of those rare\r\nchances which sometimes happen, the Roseate variety, which forms the\r\nsubject of our present illustration, had entirely escaped every accident\r\nof this nature, insomuch, that its figure may be regarded as that of a\r\nvery perfect shell.\r\n\r\nThe earliest figures of the common, or olivaceous kind, occurs in the\r\nwork of Chemnitz, and among the plates of Martin. Gmelin quotes the\r\nformer, and describes the shell under the name of Trochus Imperialis. It\r\nis truly a Trochus of the Linnæan classification, but not, it appears,\r\nof any later writer, excepting those of the Linnæan school. Sometimes it\r\nhas been generically classed as a species of SOLARIUM, a name assigned\r\nby Lamarck to the Trochi possessing the character of the Linnæan\r\n_Trochus Perspectivus_, and which he renders into his own language as a\r\ngenerical epithet, by the name _Cadran_ (Sun dial). To accord exactly\r\nwith the genus Solarium, as laid down by Lamarck himself, the general\r\nfigure of the shell should be that of a depressed cone, having at the\r\nbase an umblical opening, crenulated upon the inner edge of all the\r\nspires; as may be perceived in looking down the umbilical opening of\r\nTrochus perspectivus; and finally, the opening of the mouth should be\r\nalmost quadrangular. This is the character of SOLARIUM, as proposed by\r\nLamarck, and which does not agree exactly with the shell before us.[9]\r\nDenys de Montfort constitutes another genus of this shell, which he\r\ndenominates IMPERATOR (_Conchyliologie Systematique T. 2. p. 199_) in\r\nthe French, L’EMPEREUR. The olivaceous kind he calls Imperator\r\naureolatus, l’Empereur couronné. The character of this new genus,\r\nImperator, consists in the shell having a regular spire: in being\r\nimbricated, or covered with scales, like tiling upon the roof of a\r\nhouse: the carina of the whorls armed; the armament, for example, in the\r\nshell before us, consisting of a kind of frieze or curled foliage-like\r\nplates which succeed each other with great regularity: it has an\r\numbilicus, which, in the present shell is large and deep; the mouth of\r\nthe shell angular and entire; pillar lip spreading somewhat like a fan;\r\nand the exterior lip cut off. We have deemed it requisite to advert to\r\nthese new genera, but as the shell itself is so clearly a Trochus, we\r\nhave not thought it necessary to remove it from the place in the Linnæan\r\nSystem to which Gmelin had assigned.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  This article is thus described in the last day’s sale, lot 81, “An\r\n  elegant and unique pink variety of the imperial sun, drawn up with the\r\n  anchor of a ship, from the depth of sixty fathoms, in Cook’s Straits,\r\n  New Zealand.” Sold for £24 3s.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  In Orchard-street, Portman-square, Thursday, April 13th, 1815. _Vide_\r\n  lot 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  _Système des animaux sans vertèbres, p. 86._\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _12_\r\n\r\n  _London.

This becomes the more incumbent to\r\nobserve, because those figures afford an elucidation of some moment at\r\nleast, to the writings of an Entomologist of acknowledged eminence, the\r\nlate Professor Fabricius: he had described the species in his several\r\nworks as above adverted to, under the name of Papilio Egæa, but these\r\ndescriptions have remained before the learned world for nearly half a\r\ncentury without any pictorial illustration. The existence of such a\r\nspecies is therefore well known, but from description only, and this\r\ncircumstance, it is presumed, will tend to confer more real interest\r\nupon the figures now produced, than if it had been entirely undescribed,\r\nbecause, heretofore, a deficiency has been in this respect perceived;\r\nand that deficiency is now supplied by the figures submitted to our\r\nreaders in the annexed plate.\r\n\r\nThe first description of this species, as already intimated, to be found\r\namong authors, is that given by Fabricius in his _Systematica\r\nEntomologia_: subsequently it appeared in his work entitled _Species\r\nInsectorum_, and lastly in his _Entomologia Systematica_, as inserted\r\namong our synonyms. It is these authorities that have supplied Gmelin\r\nwith the description of the species as we find introduced by him, into\r\nthe last edition of the Linnæan Systema Naturæ.\r\n\r\nThe Fabrician description of this insect was taken in the first\r\ninstance, _Syst. Ent._ from a specimen in the Hunterian collection: the\r\nsame description occurs again in _Spec. Ins._ and lastly, in far more\r\ncopious detail in _Ent. Syst._ This latter description given by\r\nFabricius, though by some oversight of its author, not identified by any\r\nreference with the drawings of Mr. Jones, was certainly derived from\r\nthat source of authority; a point we have been enabled to ascertain,\r\nboth upon the kind information of our late worthy friend Mr. Jones\r\nhimself, and also from the manuscripts in the hand-writing of Fabricius,\r\nwhich Mr. Jones was pleased to place in our hands, in order to assure\r\nus, there could be no uncertainty in this respect from any lapse of\r\nmemory. Fabricius refers for his Papilio Egæa to the Hunterian cabinet.\r\nThere was a specimen of this insect in that collection, but it may not\r\nbe improper to observe that the specimen from which the drawing of this\r\nspecies, Papilio Egæa, by Mr. Jones, was taken, as it appeared from\r\nthese MSS. was one preserved in the cabinet of Mr. Drury, the venerable\r\nauthor of a well known work on Exotic insects, published towards the\r\nclose of the last century. We may also add, that this insect, with many\r\nothers which Mr. Jones had figured, and Fabricius had described, from\r\nthat extensive and valuable cabinet, devolved into our hands after the\r\ndeath of its proprietor, the whole collection having been dispersed by\r\npublic sale in the month of May, 1805.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus minute in the production of authorities, in order to\r\ndemonstrate that we have not ventured upon the hazard of conjecture to\r\nsubmit the present figures as those of the true Papilio Egæa of\r\nFabricius; and, consequently, of all later writers who have relied upon\r\nhis evidence. In stating this, it may not be amiss to add still further\r\nfor the information, as well as the gratification of the Naturalist, not\r\nof this country alone, but of Europe generally; and indeed of every\r\nportion of the world to which the light of science may extend, that we\r\nare in possession of the like authorities for the whole series of those\r\nPapiliones which Fabricius has described from the drawings of Mr. Jones,\r\nand which, in most instances, are the only unequivocal authorities now\r\nremaining. Possessing this means, it shall become the great object of\r\nour care to rescue from obscurity and doubt that ample portion of the\r\nscientific writings of Fabricius, by similar illustrations of the more\r\nbeautiful and rare species, of which no figures are extant, as often as\r\nwe conceive the requisite variety of our a miscellany will permit[10]\r\ntheir introduction.\r\n\r\nPapilio Egæa is a native of America; it is a species of that family\r\nwhich is distinguished by the name of _Nymphales Gemmati_, having eyes,\r\nor ocellated spots upon all the wings; it is represented in the annexed\r\nplate in a flying posture, as well as in its resting position.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  We have lately understood that the editors of _Encyclopædie\r\n  Methodique_, now publishing in Paris, intend giving figures of the\r\n  Papiliones of the Equites family, which Fabricius has described. This\r\n  endeavour to illustrate Fabricius is under the direction of Mons.\r\n  Latreille, a Member of the National Institute, an Entomologist\r\n  himself, of acknowledged talent, and one to whose great ability, as\r\n  well as personal urbanity, we are happy to bear our testimony of\r\n  praise. In the absence of more conclusive authority, the conjectures\r\n  of Mons. Latreille would be, unquestionably, useful; but we shall,\r\n  ourselves, tread the same path, and as we trust, may assist also, in\r\n  no small degree to dispel the darkness which at present overshadows\r\n  this fair portion of the science. As we are, ourselves, possessed of\r\n  the authentic evidences, by means of which, the species of Fabricius\r\n  can be immediately identified, we have no occasion to wander into the\r\n  labyrinths of conjecture: we at once arrive at the certainty of truth.\r\n  The annunciation of this design, on the part of the French editors,\r\n  leads to a conclusion of the importance attached to this endeavour: it\r\n  need be only stated on our part, that the illustrations we shall\r\n  subjoin to such of the Fabrician species as may pass under our own\r\n  observations, will be precisely taken from the individual objects\r\n  which Fabricius has described.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _13_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Previous to the time of Fabricius\r\nthis elegant species had been unnoticed by any author. Fabricius\r\ndescribes it in his Entomologia Systematica, and refers for the specimen\r\nso described to the Cabinet of Mr. Francillon. That the insect, to which\r\nhe adverts, was included in that celebrated cabinet, we are well assured\r\nfrom our own inspection, but it stood there unaccompanied by any\r\nindication of its being a specimen described by Fabricius, or even a\r\nFabrician species. The truth is, that Professor Fabricius, upon this\r\noccasion, as in some others, took his description, not from the specimen\r\nitself, but from the drawings of Mr. Jones, of Chelsea, which had been\r\ncopied from the specimen in the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, and it was to\r\nthe drawing therefore of Mr. Jones, and not to the specimen of Mr.\r\nFrancillon’s cabinet that Fabricius annexed the name of Pylades. Those\r\ndrawings must for this reason be now considered as the only positive\r\nmemorial of the identity of the Fabrician species, Papilio Pylades, that\r\nremains extant at this time. The figures, it may be added, which are\r\nsubmitted in the annexed plate, are faithful copies from the original\r\ndrawings of Mr. Jones, so inscribed in the hand writing of Fabricius, a\r\ncircumstance that must remove every shade of doubt as to the individual\r\nobject to which Fabricius had assigned that appellation.\r\n\r\nPapilio Pylades is a species of the Butterfly tribe, of moderate size,\r\nin comparison with the generality of those which appertain to the same\r\nfamily, the _Equites Achivi_ of Fabricius. The upper surface exhibits an\r\nappearance of much simplicity and elegance: the disk is white, and the\r\nbroad black limb, or border, by which it is surrounded, is marked with a\r\nnumber of spots and semilunar marks of white disposed with much\r\nregularity. The disk of the lower surface is also white, but surrounded\r\nwith a pale brown, or fulvous limb, and marked with white spots in the\r\nsame manner as the broad black border on the upper surface. A few of the\r\nwhite spots on this fulvous border are surrounded by black lines and\r\nspaces. There is also a red band marked with black and blueish spots,\r\nthat extends along the main or anterior rib of the upper wings, from the\r\nbase, as far as the middle of the wing, and a spot of red at the base of\r\nthe posterior pair.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _14_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The\r\nregion of the chin and throat is of a beautiful crimson purple, whence\r\nits name of Purple-Throated Chatterer.

The peculiarity of its\r\ncharacter consists in the large, erect, and longitudinal foliations,\r\nwhich are disposed in three distinct, and nearly equi-distant series\r\nthroughout the whole length of the shell: for they appear in continuity\r\nupon every whorl, from the base to the apex. It is from this peculiarity\r\nthat the species has obtained the very appropriate appellation of\r\nfoliatus, or Foliated Rock Shell.\r\n\r\nIn point of colour, as before observed, the Murex foliatus is not\r\nparticularly conspicuous, and they are of a texture so delicate that it\r\nalmost constantly occurs in a bleached or depauperated state; it is also\r\na very fragile shell, and from this cause very liable to be broken. When\r\nin fine condition, as in the example selected, for the representation\r\nnow before us, the general hue is a lacteal white; the body of the\r\nshell, externally, a deep tawny, with the foliations whitish, and the\r\nopening, or mouth of the shell, very delicately tinted with a violaceous\r\nhue. Sometimes the foliations have the appearance of fine white\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nThis is esteemed a scarce shell, and very rarely occurs perfect, or in a\r\nliving state.

The shell is of the spiral\r\nkind, with an oval aperture; the head of the spire large or tumid, and\r\nthe first or body whorl beset with four distinct longitudinal rows or\r\nseries of elongated foliations or processes. These last mentioned\r\nappendages are flat and somewhat cylindrical from the base nearly to\r\ntheir summits, where they become cleft or furcate, expanding most\r\ncommonly into two, sometimes three, or rarely four distinct little\r\nlobes, and the radiation of these process by which the exterior margin\r\nof the aperture is encircled, have a groove or canal extending from the\r\nmargin of the lip to the cleft or lobate summits.\r\n\r\nThe learned Seba, to whom this very remarkable shell, it appears, was\r\nknown, has well observed in speaking of the Murices, which he describes,\r\nthat this kind is more particularly distinguished by the greater\r\ndisproportion of those advanced processes in comparison with the size of\r\nthe body of the shell than any other of his species; so that their\r\nsuperior length in this respect was, in his opinion, to be considered\r\ntruly characteristic of the species.* It is from these processes it may\r\nbe also added, that this curious shell has been variously and not\r\nunfrequently fantastically designated by appellations that cannot very\r\nreadily be reconciled in our ideas with any object they have been\r\nsupposed to resemble, even admitting that latitude of fancy which may be\r\ntolerated when we are entirely aware that the assimilation is remote.\r\nThus this shell has obtained in various languages names according with\r\nthose of the Ragged Spike Whelk, the Stag’s Horn Whelk, the Skeleton,\r\nWater Trough, and others of no less vague import. The Least Ragged Whelk\r\nis a name assigned to it by our countryman Petiver: the Scorpion Shell\r\nis a very old name for it among the early collectors, it is the Murex\r\nScorpio of Rumpfius. In France it was distinguished formerly by the name\r\nof _Patte de Crapaud_, (the Toad’s Foot) because, says the author of\r\nDavila’s Catalogue, besides the spires on the body, the exterior edge of\r\nthe lip is bordered with others that are very large and flat at the\r\nextremity, and no doubt, for the same reason it is called by Seba\r\n_Bufonis Pedes_. It was known at that time also among the collectors in\r\nHolland by the name of the Stag’s Horn,[11] from a remote similitude\r\nwhich these processes are supposed to bear to the horns of that\r\nquadruped. And lastly, in conclusion it may be added, that for nearly\r\nhalf a century past it has been distinguished among the collectors of\r\nthis country by a title not less whimsical, namely, the “Water Wheel,”\r\nfrom a fancied similitude the contour of the shell and its\r\nverticillation of processes bear to the circle and lamellar appendages\r\nor sweeps of a water wheel.\r\n\r\nNot one of any of those various appellations, it must be confessed,\r\nappear so applicable and well chosen as to supersede the propriety of\r\nintroducing any other that might be deemed tolerably appropriate, but\r\nupon the whole the species and varieties which it embraces have been so\r\nlong known by the name of the Scorpion Shell, that there can be no great\r\nimpropriety in allowing it to remain under that name: we have for our\r\nexample the authority of Rumpfius, and the sanction of Linnæus\r\nthroughout all his works; and in the Gmelinian System it also stands\r\nunder the name of Murex Scorpio. The appellation of the Stag’s Horn\r\nMurex, in conformity with the epithet assigned to it by the old French\r\nwriters “_bois de cerf_,” is not altogether inappropriate, the elongated\r\nprocesses have much the appearance of the antlers of the stag, in the\r\nfirst stages of their growth; or considered in the aggregate, the shell\r\npresents a number of ramose processes like the horns of the Stag or the\r\nRein Deer, and some other quadrupeds of the Cervine tribe; a\r\ncharacteristic feature that may perhaps justify the appellation.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of this remarkable shell, some of which\r\nmight at the first view be considered as distinct species, and in\r\nreality have been occasionally arranged as such by collectors. These\r\nupon the most attentive comparison do not, however, appear to differ\r\nspecifically, notwithstanding the differences in point of colour are\r\nvery striking. One variety rather exceeds the rest in size, and is of a\r\ndeep testaceous or tawny brown colour, or rather inclining to a chesnut\r\nhue: we have seen it of a tawny tint with darker splashes upon the\r\ntransverse ribs, particularly on the body and the tumid whorl of the\r\nspire. Occasionally this shell also occurs of a deep or Ethiopian\r\nblackness; this kind is extremely rare. The white variety occurs more\r\nfrequently, but is, nevertheless, uncommon in comparison with the brown\r\nor testaceous kind: two examples of the white variety, clouded with\r\nyellow, appears to have occurred in the celebrated cabinet of the French\r\ncollector Davilla, about the year 1776. He distinguishes them by the\r\ntitle of “deux petites _epineuses_,” and tells us they have six\r\nlongitudinal sides like the “_rameuses_,” which are also named “Pattes\r\nde crapaud,” an epithet by which we are well aware the Linnæan Murex\r\nScorpio was discriminated, and which therefore leads to a conclusion\r\nthat the “epineuses” of a white colour, clouded with yellow, which that\r\ncabinet contained, were not specifically distinct from the shell at\r\npresent under our consideration. When extremely fine the white variety\r\nof this shell is usually very delicately tinged with violet in all its\r\nshades and transitions of light.\r\n\r\nAll these varieties, as before observed, are very easily reconciled to\r\nthe same species; nor is it ourselves alone that are inclined to this\r\nopinion. Seba, to whom the larger brown and white variety, were known,\r\nadmits them as the same without any hesitation.[12] The expression\r\n“_Testa alba aut fusca_,” the Linnæan description of this shell in the\r\ncabinet of the Queen of Sweden, implies the like persuasion, and the\r\nauthority of Chemnitz may be adduced still further in support of this\r\nopinion: Some modern writers have thought differently, but we must\r\nconfess the distinctions they assign are by no means satisfactory to us.\r\nThe larger shell is usually of a brown colour, but we have seen one of\r\nthe white variety rather larger than any of the brown colour that have\r\noccurred to our notice.\r\n\r\nThe shell we have selected for the figures in the annexed plate is\r\nchosen rather for its extreme perfection than the superiority of size;\r\nwe have observed it larger by nearly one half, but have not in any\r\ninstance met with one more entirely perfect: it is delineated from the\r\nexample of this very curious species in the late Leverian Museum.\r\n\r\nThis species which for a century past or more has maintained its\r\nreputation as a rare production is still held in much esteem, and bears\r\na price proportionately considerable: it inhabits the shores of Southern\r\nAsia. Gmelin has the expression “_Habitat pretiosus et rarus in_ mari,\r\nAsiam australem _alluente_, _&c._” and describes the species as being\r\neither white, brown, or black.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  “Cornua cervina—_bois de cerf_.”—Seba.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  “Horum processus admodum producti sunt; ut ideo Cornua cervina\r\n  appellentur ob qualemcunque similitudinem.

Its size is rather less than that of\r\nour common house sparrow. The prevailing colour of the plumage a rich\r\nvernal green, deepest in its hues on the back and wings, and rather\r\npaler or more delicate in its tint beneath; the breast and rump scarlet;\r\nthe feathers of the latter elongated and extending far over the tail,\r\nwhich is green; the crown of the head a beautiful Sapphirine blue. This\r\nappears to be the male bird. That which is considered as the female has\r\na yellow spot upon the throat: it is destitute of any scarlet spot upon\r\nthe breast, and the Sapphirine colour on the crown of the head is also\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThese are the characteristic distinctions observable generally in the\r\nspecies; besides which there are other less material particulars in\r\nwhich these birds are known to differ.\r\n\r\nIn some birds we find a yellow transverse stripe on the hind part of the\r\nneck, varying in colour from luteous to orange, and which is more or\r\nless conspicuous in different individuals. Others have a somewhat\r\nsimilar band of yellow, but which is situated at the back of the head\r\ninstead of the neck. The first of these is distinguished by the name of\r\nthe Sapphire Crowned Parrakeet, the other by that of the Phillippine\r\nParrakeet. Dr. Latham has endeavoured to establish the characteristic\r\ndistinctions of these two kinds in his _Index Ornithologicus_: he\r\nconsiders them as permanent varieties, but we must confess we regard\r\nthem rather as accidental than permanent. The characteristic band of\r\nyellow by which they are to be discriminated chiefly, appears to be more\r\nor less developed in different birds at different periods of their\r\ngrowth; and in the absence of this character from the back of the head\r\nin the Phillippine Parrakeet, or the hind part of the neck in the\r\nSapphire Crowned Parrakeet, the resemblance is so very near as to afford\r\nno certain means of distinguishing one from the other.\r\n\r\nThis bird has been long known in Europe. It appeared in the work of\r\nEdwards, the ingenious English Ornithologist, who lived about the middle\r\nof the last century. Linnæus describes the species with much critical\r\nminuteness in the fourth volume of his _Amoenitates Academicæ_, as\r\nPSITTACUS GALGULUS, _brachiurus viridis pectore uropygioque coccineis,\r\nvertice cæruleo_; and this description accords so exactly with the bird\r\nbefore us, that no doubt whatever can remain of its being exactly the\r\nvariety which that eminent Naturalist has described.\r\n\r\nEdwards informs us that this bird is a native of Sumatra; Osbeck met\r\nwith it in Java, where he tells us it is known by the name of Parkicki.\r\nThe title of Perruche de Pérou which it bears in _Pdl. Enl._ might\r\ninduce a persuasion of its being an inhabitant of South America, which,\r\nhowever, is not believed among Ornithologists. We have already mentioned\r\nthat it occurs in the Phillippine Islands, and that from this locality,\r\nthe particular variety found there has obtained the appellation of the\r\nPhillippine Parrakeet.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Osbeck for a concise description of the manners of\r\nthis interesting species when in a state of captivity, “if put into a\r\ncage,” observes this traveller, “it whistles very seldom and commonly\r\ngrows quite sullen: it hangs itself with its feet so that the back is\r\nturned towards the earth, and seldom changes this situation: it is fed\r\nwith boiled rice; in which manner, in the year 1752, one was brought to\r\nGottenburgh.” It is probably this information to which Linnæus alludes\r\nin his Academic paper, delivered in 1760, where in speaking of the\r\nmanners of this bird, he tells us it sleeps on trees, suspended by one\r\nfoot with its head downwards, in order to escape the observation of the\r\nrapacious birds of night. The nest of these birds are described by\r\nToreen. “We observed,” says this writer, “that their nests were\r\nremarkable for their exceeding fine texture, but we did not see the\r\nbirds. If these nests were differently constructed, the monkies would be\r\nvery mischievous to them; but now, before they can get to the opening,\r\nthe lowest part, as the weakest, breaks into pieces, and the visitor\r\nfalls to the ground without danger to the young birds.”\r\n\r\nThis bird is observed to be very partial to the fresh juice of the cocoa\r\ntree, which flows from the ends of the branches when the fruit has been\r\nfresh cut off; and which before it undergoes fermentation is said in\r\ntaste to resemble new-made cyder.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _18_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Papilio Acamas is scarcely surpassed\r\nin size by any other of the Papilio genus, and when it is added, as it\r\nmay be with confidence, that the figure now presented to the reader is\r\nthe first that has appeared in elucidation of such a noble species, we\r\ncannot doubt that its introduction will be received with pleasure by\r\nevery Naturalist in this country and throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThis fine and very striking species has been long since known by repute\r\nto Entomologists; but from the description only which Fabricius had left\r\nus in his _Entomologia Systematica_. Those conversant with this work of\r\nour author, will be aware, that Papilio Acamas constitutes one of those\r\nmany species for which Fabricius refers only to the drawings of the late\r\nMr. Jones: the present figure is a faithful copy of that original\r\ndrawing referred to and described by Fabricius, and as such cannot fail\r\nto prove acceptable to every Entomologist. It is certainly the only\r\nfigure extant by means of which the Fabrician species P. Acamas can be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe identity of this species, it will hence appear, does not rest upon\r\nopinion or conjecture, and this circumstance must be deemed of no small\r\nimportance in an enquiry of this nature. In the present instance it may\r\nbe also added that this identity is essentially material to be\r\nconsidered, because there is another insect of the same tribe, the\r\nPapilio Laodocus of the same author, which assimilates so closely with\r\nit, that without due attention, the one might readily be confounded with\r\nthe other. These two butterflies, however, although they appear so\r\nnearly allied, present characters which considered accurately,\r\ndemonstrate very clearly that Fabricius was right in separating them.\r\nFabricius adverting to this close affinity, observes, that in size and\r\nappearance Papilio Acamas agrees with Papilio Laodocus. The predominant\r\ncolour of P. Acamas, he observes, is a dark or fuscous brown, much less\r\ninclining to black than P. Laodocus. The anterior wings in both species\r\nhave a yellow transverse band: this band in P. Acamas extends from the\r\nanterior margin almost close to the posterior margin, and touches the\r\nposterior rib; in P. Laodocus this yellow band is abbreviated or\r\nshorter, of greater breadth, and placed more immediately towards the\r\nmiddle of the wing, the band in P. Acamas being situated rather nearer\r\ntowards the exterior end of the wing. There is also a marginal series of\r\nyellow spots at the extremity of the anterior wings, the form of which\r\nis very singular, and affords a striking distinctive character of P.\r\nAcamas. There is also a characteristic difference observable in the\r\nmarkings of the posterior wings: in both species, on the upper as well\r\nas lower surface, those wings are elegantly marked with a distinct arch\r\nof red lunules, posterior to which is another of blue; beyond these in\r\nP. Acamas is a third series of lunules, rather larger than either of the\r\nformer, the colour of which is bright yellow. There is a final or\r\nposterior arch of lunules in P. Laodocus, behind the two series of red\r\nand blue lunules, similar to those of P. Acamas, but they are smaller,\r\nand instead of yellow are white. And lastly, the body in P. Acamas is\r\ndark brown above and pale beneath: in P. Laodocus, on the contrary, the\r\nbody beneath as well as above is black, with a longitudinal line each\r\nside the body.\r\n\r\nWe have been thus minute in pointing out precisely the differences that\r\nprevail between these two Papiliones, from a persuasion that they might\r\nperhaps be otherwise confounded together, either as the same species, or\r\nas varieties of each other. There is assuredly a general approximation\r\nin the appearance of those two insects, although they prove so very\r\ndistinct upon a close and attentive comparison.\r\n\r\nPapilio Acamas is a native of Jamaica: Papilio Laodocus of South\r\nAmerica. A figure of P. Laodocus occurs in the work of Cramer, under the\r\nname of Papilio Glaucus.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _19_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Fabricius saw the drawing\r\nof this insect in the Collectanea of Paintings formed by the ingenious\r\nhand of that indefatigable and liberal Naturalist the late William\r\nJones, Esq. of Chelsea, and was so delighted with its grandeur, as an\r\ninsect altogether undescribed, that he determined upon assigning to it\r\nsome name of pre-eminent distinction. The tribe of insects to which it\r\nnaturally appertains in systematic classification, is that of the\r\n_Equites Achivi_; all the species of which are named after the Greeks,\r\nand more especially of those commemorated in the Iliad and the Odyssey:\r\nthe heroes of the Trojan war. This rule determined his choice, and we\r\nmay readily conceive his admiration of the species from the name\r\nselected upon this occasion, _Papilio Homerus_. If Homer had no claim to\r\nbe considered as a Greek, he had sang the achievements of the Grecian\r\nheroes, and had mourned the fall of Troy; and Fabricius disposed alike\r\nto compliment the immortal bard, and define the species by an\r\nappellation more than usually superlative, has consecrated it to the\r\nmemory of that ancient poet.\r\n\r\nIf we advert to the writings of Fabricius, it will be found that this\r\nauthor refers for a figure of this fine Papilio solely to the Paintings\r\nof Mr. Jones. The reference is to the eighth drawing of the first volume\r\nof his collectanea. This is perfectly correct, the figure occurs in that\r\ncollection of paintings as Fabricius states, and in the part described.\r\nWe have not only seen it there with the name assigned to it in\r\n_Entomologia Systematica_ PAPILIO HOMERUS inscribed in the hand-writing\r\nof Fabricius, but are at this time in possession of an exact copy of\r\nthat drawing, taken by the express permission of its former very worthy\r\nproprietor; and it is from this copy of the original drawing so\r\ninscribed by Fabricius himself, that the very beautiful figure is taken\r\nwhich accompanies the present description.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the general accuracy with which Fabricius has related\r\nthe local circumstances connected with the history of the insects which\r\nhe describes, there are occasionally errors in this respect it must be\r\nsatisfactory to many of our readers to have corrected: errors, which,\r\nowing to the lapse of time and death of those distinguished Naturalists\r\nwhich Fabricius had the happiness of meeting with in England, we may\r\nventure to presume, without vanity, can be now corrected only through\r\nthe medium of our assistance. The celebrity of Fabricius throughout\r\nEurope as one of the best informed Entomologists of the last century,\r\nrenders it even of no small importance to correct the most trivial\r\noversights he has committed; and this consideration will, we trust,\r\nafford us some apology for that minuteness, if not prolixity with which\r\nit may be requisite occasionally to relate particulars of a local\r\nnature, in order to correct such errors. An instance of this kind occurs\r\nin the note annexed to the Fabrician description of the Papilio now\r\nbefore us; in stating the local circumstances connected with its\r\nhistory, Fabricius says _Habitat in America_. _Dom Latham._ There is\r\nobviously an oversight in this passage, for we well know that the\r\nFabrician description of this species was taken from the figure in the\r\nseries of drawings painted by Mr. Jones, which has been already\r\nmentioned; the original of the figure now presented by us to the\r\nattention of our readers; and that the specimen of the insect itself\r\nfrom which that painting was taken was preserved at the time Fabricius\r\ndescribed it in the celebrated collection of the late Mr. Dru Drury. As\r\nwe had the pleasure of Mr. Drury’s acquaintance, as well as that of Mr.\r\nJones, and had an unreserved access to the information and cabinets of\r\nboth, we are enabled to speak upon this circumstance with confidence.\r\nThe example of Papilio Homerus in the cabinet of Mr. Drury was perfectly\r\nfamiliar to us, it was ourselves who wrote the name _Homerus_, annexed\r\nto this insect in that cabinet; and so far as our recollection serves at\r\nthe distant period of five and twenty years, Mr. Drury stated to us that\r\nhe had received this individual specimen from the Island of Jamaica. We\r\nare in possession of the Entomological manuscripts of this venerable\r\nauthor, but among those we have in vain sought for any positive\r\nconfirmation of this distant recollection. It appears certain that Mr.\r\nDrury had not entered it under the name of _Homerus_ in his catalogue\r\nafter we had communicated that name to him; and which we did upon the\r\nauthority of the Fabrician manuscripts annexed to the drawings of Mr.\r\nJones. At the time Mr. Drury received this insect from his correspondent\r\nit was assuredly a nameless species, and was probably entered as such,\r\nwith a number only; such omissions in the nomenclature being, of course,\r\nusual when the species proved to be undescribed, till proper names could\r\nbe assigned to them. A gentleman of the name of Keuchan, and another of\r\nthe name of Whiting, appear from these entries to be the only\r\ncorrespondents who furnished Mr. Drury with Papiliones of Jamaica; it\r\nwas probably from the former that he obtained this majestic species; and\r\nthat Mr. Drury obtained it about the year 1777. This _habitat_ would\r\njustify Fabricius in describing the insect as a native of America,\r\nalthough if the conclusion be correct, it might have been stated more\r\ndistinctly as a native of that island.\r\n\r\nAt the dissolution of the fine collection of that indefatigable\r\nEntomologist, Mr. Drury, which took place by public sale in the month of\r\nMay, 1805, this beautiful insect was purchased by another very eminent\r\ncollector, Mr. John Francillon, at the price of _four pounds\r\nsterling_,[13] and subsequently at the death of this last mentioned\r\nindividual, which happened in the year 1817, it passed with many others\r\nof the more costly rarities into the cabinet of Alexander Mc’Leay, Esq.\r\nS.L.S. &c.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Fabrician reference to the cabinet of Dr. Latham,\r\nfor it is to the cabinet of the venerable Ornithologist of that name the\r\nreference applies, we believe it is also in our power to explain its\r\norigin, having occasionally, through the kindness of its proprietor,\r\nconsulted that cabinet, and finally, in conformity with his permission,\r\nwritten a catalogue of its contents. In that cabinet we certainly\r\nobserved a Papilio allied to P. Homerus, but yet so far remote from it,\r\nthat we could not venture to pronounce it the same; it may be a variety\r\nof the species, but is assuredly not the insect painted by Mr. Jones to\r\nwhich the synonyms of Fabricius allude.\r\n\r\nPapilio Homerus is represented in its natural size in the annexed plate.\r\nIts colours are various and very beautifully disposed: the ground or\r\nprevailing colour is a deep or dark brown with a broad stripe of a\r\nyellowish hue across the middle of each wing, forming very nearly a band\r\nof that peculiar kind distinguished among Naturalists by the appellation\r\nof a common band. There is also a large and somewhat quadrangular spot\r\nof the same flavous colour upon the disk within and contiguous to the\r\nband, and beyond, towards the apex, a small sub-angular band composed of\r\nsmaller flavous spots. Behind the yellow band, across the disk of the\r\nposterior wings, are a series of blue spots composed of many little\r\nshining points, which in the aggregate form a distinct spot of an ovate\r\nform, most brilliant towards the centre and paler towards the edge. And\r\nfinally, there are three distinct sublunate spots of red on each\r\nposterior wing, one at the anal angle, and the other two at the\r\nposterior margin, one of which is situated on each side near the base of\r\nthe tail. Beneath, the anterior wings are uniformly dark with a single\r\npale or whitish marginal spot at the tip; the lower wings of a fuscous\r\ncolour with seven ocellar spots of black, the iris of which are rufous.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Lot 305, third day, Saturday, May 25th, 1805.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _20_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The very\r\nclose affinity which it bears to the Gmelinian Pipra Nævia, a species\r\ndescribed originally by Buffon under the title of _Fourmilier tacheté de\r\nCayenne_, may possibly have occasioned some confusion among authors\r\nrespecting this individual species, but there are still, if we mistake\r\nnot, sufficient indications of the two birds being specifically\r\ndistinct. This was the opinion of the late Dr. Shaw: he constituted a\r\nnew species of the bird before us under the name of PIPRA PUNCTATA, and\r\nthe english trivial of SPECKLED MANAKIN, and we are induced to follow\r\nthat example from a persuasion that his conclusion was correct. Pipra\r\nNævia, to which it is so nearly allied, has the throat and chin black,\r\nand the breast spotted with black: Pipra Punctata, on the contrary, has\r\nthe throat and breast yellow, without any black spots. These differences\r\nafford a conspicuous distinction of the two birds, besides which, there\r\nare some others of less consideration that will appear upon an attentive\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nAs a new species, it appears, therefore, pretty certain that we have to\r\nacknowledge the late Dr. Shaw as the first author by whom this\r\ninteresting bird was introduced to the knowledge of the learned world:\r\nhe describes it, as before observed, under the name of Pipra punctata.\r\nM. Vieillot is consequently in an error when he refers to authority of\r\nDr. Latham for this name. The bird was so designated in the first\r\ninstance, in the work entitled the _Naturalist’s Miscellany_, written by\r\nDr. Shaw; nor was the species mentioned by Dr. Latham either in his\r\nSynopsis or his Index Ornithologicus. In a final or second supplement\r\npublished by Dr. Latham long after the Synopsis, we find the bird\r\nmentioned under the name of the _Speckled Manakin_, but only upon the\r\nauthority of the Naturalist’s Miscellany of Shaw, and a drawing of the\r\nbird by General Davies, for at that late period even, the bird appears\r\nto be unknown to Dr. Latham, except upon those two authorities. This\r\nobservation is the more material since the Ornithologist M. Vieillot in\r\ndividing the Linnæan Genus Pipra into two Genera, Pardalotus and Pipra,\r\nassigns for the type of his genus PARDALOTUS the “_Pipra punctata_” of\r\nLatham, at the same time, as we have already shewn, the works of Dr.\r\nLatham affords us no such name. The present species was described under\r\nthe appellation of _Pipra punctata_ only by Dr. Shaw. Dr. Latham does\r\nnot adopt this name, he records the species only under the trivial\r\nenglish name of the Speckled Manakin, which name had also been assigned\r\nbefore by Dr. Shaw. If, therefore, the name of Pipra punctata had\r\noccurred to M. Vieillot, it must have been in the work of Dr. Shaw, and\r\nnot of Dr. Latham. Perhaps Vieillot had inadvertently imagined this\r\nSpeckled Manakin to be the same as the Spotted Manakin of Dr. Latham’s\r\nSynopsis. If this be really the source of error, it may be added, that\r\nthis latter bird appears to have been described by Dr. Latham upon the\r\nauthority only of Planches Enluminées, and is no other than Pipra Nævia\r\nof Gmelin, as Dr. Latham has himself pointed out in his Index\r\nOrnithologicus.\r\n\r\nThe description of this bird, as it occurs in the first instance, in the\r\nworks of Dr. Shaw, is to this effect. PIPRA PUNCTATA (SPECKLED MANAKIN)\r\n_grisea_, _fusco undulata_, _vertice alisque nigris_, _albo punctatis\r\ntectricibus caudæ rubris_. The notice of the species as before-mentioned\r\nin Dr. Latham’s second Supplement is subsequent to this, and appears\r\nonly under the trivial name of the Speckled Manakin.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to the separation of the Pipra genus as it occurs in the\r\nwork of M. Vieillot, it will not be amiss to point out precisely those\r\ndistinctions, which, according to his mode of classification, constitute\r\nthe characters of those two genera into which he has divided them. The\r\nfirst of these genera denominated PARDALOTUS comprehends those species\r\nof the Pipra genus in which the form of the bill is very short in\r\nproportion to its length, a little robust or stout, the base dilated\r\nupon the edges, entire, conoid, thick at the point, the upper mandible a\r\nlittle bent, and the lower one convex beneath. Those birds which are\r\nallowed to remain in the Pipra genus have the bill conoid, trigonal at\r\nthe base, compressed at the sides near the end, cut off and curved at\r\nthe point, the lower mandible turning up at the extremity; and the\r\nexterior toes connected rather beyond the middle. It may be added,\r\nfinally, that Cuvier, on the contrary, in his _Règne Animal_, allows the\r\nManakins (Pipra of Linnæus) to remain united as before. He does not\r\nadopt the genus Pardalotus, and this circumstance is the more worthy of\r\nnote since we have seen the species arranged in our Museums with the\r\nsynonymous appellation of “PARDALOTUS PUNCTATUS _Cuvier_,” and have\r\nobserved it designated as the type of Cuvier’s New Genus Pardalotus.\r\n\r\nThis interesting little creature being represented in its natural size\r\nin the plate annexed, it will be perceived to be one of the smaller\r\ntribes of the feathered race: we have even few birds in England more\r\ndiminutive, for in point of magnitude it does not exceed that of our\r\ncommon willow-wren, its length being only about four inches. The\r\nelegance of its plumage, is, however, in a peculiar degree attractive,\r\nand more than amply compensates for this inferiority in size. The\r\ngeneral colour above is cinereous brown, varying to a cinereous purple;\r\nthe throat and breast a delicate fulvous yellow; the crown of the head\r\nblack spotted with white; the wings, except the coverts, which are the\r\nsame colour as the back, are black, and the tip of each of these black\r\nfeathers are marked with a spot of white. The rump coverts are\r\ntestaceous, becoming gradually redder towards the end: the tail itself\r\nis black, having the base of a fine crimson with some intermixture of\r\nyellow; and in general, though not invariably, there is a white dot at\r\nthe tip of each of the tail feathers; sometimes it is only the outer\r\nfeather on each side the tail that is marked with a white dot. Beneath,\r\nthe throat and breast is of a delicate yellow colour; the bill black,\r\nand legs brown.\r\n\r\nIn the plate that accompanies this description, this elegant little bird\r\nappears perched upon a sprig of the _ovate leaved Goodenia_, GOODENIA\r\nOVATA, a vegetable production of the Australasian regions, that flowered\r\nin the month of July, during the present year, in the Royal Gardens,\r\nKew.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _21_\r\n\r\n  _London.

This is the Linnæan character\r\nof the animal inhabitant of the Voluta Genus, and consequently of the\r\nspecies now before us.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be disputed that the discoveries which have taken place\r\namong the vermes of those testaceous bodies since the time of Linnæus,\r\nhave introduced us to a far more extensive acquaintance with the beings\r\nof this nature than Linnæus could have possessed. The term Limax, which\r\nLinnæus applied not only to the animal inhabitants of the Voluta family,\r\nbut also to the Buccinum, the Strombus, the Murex, the Trochus, the\r\nTurbo, in short to almost every genus of the Univalves, and some even of\r\nthe Bivalves could not fail to excite remark. It could scarcely be\r\nconceived that in the very ample range of the creation which those\r\ngenera embraced, such uniformity could prevail, and the subsequent\r\nobservations of various Naturalists have tended fully to assure us that\r\nthe Linnæan character of the animal inhabitants of the testaceous tribes\r\nwas much too vague and comprehensive. There are indeed, it must be\r\nconfessed, a considerable number of those testaceous bodies, the animals\r\nof which are still unknown, and may possibly so remain, but forming our\r\nconclusions, from the great multitude that has been recently discovered,\r\nand the number of those which have been examined with anatomical\r\nattention, we may presume, with safety, that the Linnæan Limaces ought\r\nproperly to be divided into several distinct genera. How far a\r\nmethodical distribution of the shells themselves, founded upon the\r\nzoological distinctions of the animal inhabitants, may be admissible in\r\nour cabinets appears less certain. The greater number of those shells,\r\nof which the animals are totally unknown, present insuperable\r\nobjections; and the attention of collectors in the formation of the\r\nConchological Cabinet, so rarely extend beyond the more obvious\r\ncharacters which the structure of the shells present, that we can\r\nscarcely deem it practicable.\r\n\r\nThe animal of the shell before us, Voluta pyrum, has been ascertained\r\nand well described by Lamarck, De Montfort, and other writers; it has\r\nthe head armed with two obtuse feelers of a club-like form; the eyes\r\nadvanced and placed at the base, at the outerside of those feelers; the\r\nmantle or fleshy covering terminating in an elongation folded into a\r\nkind of tube above the head; the foot, or disk, strong and muscular, and\r\narmed with a small round horny operculum.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Linnæan classification, the shelly covering of this\r\nanimal is a Voluta; and so far as the most prominent criterion of the\r\nVoluta genus, the folds or plaits upon the pillar lip be considered,\r\nthis character is unequivocal. Linnæus regarding this as one of its most\r\nessential definitions, has overlooked the differences that prevail in\r\nthe structure of the spire and beaks, or includes them only as\r\ndistinctions of the different families into which his Volutæ are\r\ndivided. Later writers differ upon this subject; these differences are\r\nconsidered by many as generical, and thus the Linnæan Volutæ have become\r\nseparated into several distinct genera. In the shell before us, the beak\r\nis lengthened or produced, and canaliculated; and thus constitutes in\r\nthe classification of Lamarck, a species of his TURBINELLA; and is the\r\nshell in particular which he adopts as the type of that genus. The\r\ncharacter of that genus, as proposed by this Conchologist, in his work\r\nentitled _Animaux sans vertèbres_, is thus expressed, Turbinelle\r\n(Turbinella) a shell turbinated or subfusiform, canaliculated to the\r\nbase, and having upon the column from three to five plaits or folds of a\r\ncompressed form and placed transversely. Murex scolymus of Martini,\r\nVoluta ceramica of Lister, and Voluta capitellum of the same author, are\r\ncomprehended with the Linnæan Voluta pyrum in this genus Turbinellus.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by De Montfort that Lamarck has made a group of\r\nthose shells which accord with the above character, and which he himself\r\nadopts with some small variations: according to this writer, the genus\r\nTurbinelle, of which our Voluta Pyrum is considered as the type, has the\r\nshell heavy, univalve, with an obtuse spire ending in a nipple; the\r\nmouth sloping and lengthened; the pillar denticulated with large equal\r\nfolds or plaits, the outer lip strait and cut off, and the base\r\nlengthened.\r\n\r\nAfter all the pains, however, which Lamarck and other Continental\r\nNaturalists have taken to establish the genus Turbinella, Cuvier in his\r\nRègne Animal observes that the shells of this genus differ in no other\r\nrespect from the Conic Volutes than in the prolongation of their\r\nopening, forming a kind of canal, and adding that it is not easy to\r\ntrace the limits between the one and the other.\r\n\r\nWe have experienced some surprise in observing that while so much\r\nattention has been bestowed by writers upon the generical distinctions\r\nof Voluta Pyrum, the differences that prevail in its presumed varieties\r\nhave almost entirely escaped attention. It should be remarked that in\r\nthe Gmelinian constitution of this species there are no less than four\r\ndistinct varieties, all which, according to Gmelin, and subsequently to\r\nother writers, appertain to the Linnæan species Pyrum. From the\r\nsynonymous references which Lamarck has brought together in one view, it\r\nis obvious that his opinion is the same; his TURBINELLA PYRUM, which is\r\nthe same as the Linnæan Voluta Pyrum, will be observed to comprehend the\r\nseveral presumed varieties of the species to be found in the works of\r\nMartini and Chemnitz, and the same is again observable in the works of\r\nDenys de Montfort. There are, however, some Conchologists in England who\r\ndo not agree in this particular, for they constitute at least three\r\ndistinct species of the presumed varieties of Voluta Pyrum. This\r\ndivision of the species was first proposed by Dr. Solander, and has been\r\nsubsequently adopted in several of our English Cabinets. As the\r\nparticulars of this arrangement may not prove unacceptable, we shall\r\nproceed to describe them.\r\n\r\nTo the _first_ of these new species Dr. Solander retains the Linnæan\r\nname of VOLUTA PYRUM, it is that kind which has the beak elongated, and\r\nis known by the familiar name of the LONG BEAKED TURNIP SHELL. This is\r\nthe Voluta rostrata of some Conchologists; Rapum rostratum of the\r\nColonnian Museum; and inhabits the seas of Tranquebar.\r\n\r\nAs the preceding shell is distinguished by the name of the Long beaked\r\nTurnip Shell, in allusion to the elongated structure of the beak, there\r\nis another known by the appellation of the High Spired Turnip Shell, in\r\nreference to the greater elevation of its spire; this is a _second_\r\nspecies of Solander, and is called by him VOLUTA PONDEROSA; in the\r\nCalonnian Museum it stood under the name of Rapum productum. This shell\r\ninhabits the seas of Madagascar, and is the kind which becomes the more\r\nimmediate object of our consideration as the subject of our present\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ kind of Turnip Shell is from the straits of Malacca, a shell\r\nmore ponderous than the preceding; of a broader form and having the\r\nspire more depressed. This is the common Heavy Turnip Shell of our\r\nEnglish Cabinet, Voluta gravis of Solander.\r\n\r\nThese distinctions proposed by the late Dr. Solander are found\r\nconformable, in a particular degree, with the classification observable\r\nin the cabinet of M. de Colonne. The shells of M. de Colonne, it\r\nappears, were thus arranged by the celebrated Conchologist M. Favanne.\r\nThey have, nevertheless, we believe, passed unnoticed by any of the\r\nmodern writers upon this subject. The distinctions are certainly\r\nobvious, and might probably fully authorize their separation into\r\nspecies: it must be at least admitted that as varieties of the same\r\nspecies they are strikingly distinct.\r\n\r\nHaving so far treated upon the generical distinctions of Voluta Pyrum,\r\nand pointed out the differences that exist among its principal supposed\r\nvarieties, we arrive at another point of view in which the history of\r\nthis shell becomes no less important, or less worthy of our\r\nconsideration: the sacred character which from some superstitious\r\ncauses, remote beyond all research of the present race of men, this\r\nshell has acquired in the Mythology of the Indian Nations: in the rites\r\nand worship of the Indian Brahma. Among these people this shell is\r\ncalled the CHANK, or SACRED CHANK, the emblem of an attribute of the\r\ndivine power, and is constantly seen in one of the hands of the Indian\r\nDeity Vishnu, as a type of the renovation of the earth from the waters\r\nof the deluge.—The cause of this catastrophe of the earth, the deluge,\r\nthey attribute to the wickedness of mankind in remote ages, which\r\nincensing the divine Brahma, he caused a flood of the waters to overflow\r\nthe earth and destroy every vestige of the creation, animate and\r\ninanimate, that existed upon its surface. After awhile the supreme\r\nBrahma disposed to restore creation, commanded Vishnu to deliver the\r\nearth from the flood of waters, and in testimony of its deliverance\r\nVishnu bears in his hand the Chank Shell, the symbol of its\r\nrenovation.[14]\r\n\r\nWithout proceding at any considerable length into the history of those\r\nmythological persuasions, it may be permitted to observe that as a type\r\nof the divine power in relieving the earth from the flood of waters with\r\nwhich it was overwhelmed at the time of the deluge, this shell is held\r\namong the Indians of the Brahma persuasion as one of the most sacred\r\nemblems of that figurative divinity; and this religion, it will be\r\nremembered, extends over no small portion of India and China, and even\r\nto part of Russia and Tartary. Vishnu, as one of the three attributes or\r\ntriad of Brahma, almost invariably appears with this symbol in his hand.\r\nWhether in their paintings, sculptures, or carvings, or in the sacred\r\nparaphernalia of their temples, the Chank-shell is the customary type of\r\ntheir deity Vishnu, and sometimes it occurs in the hands of the inferior\r\ndeities,[15] to whom Vishnu is imagined to have confided a portion of\r\nhis power. If the Chank be the object of their devotion in health, so\r\nalso it is the object of their superstitions in sickness and in death.\r\nThe medicine administered by the Priest to his patient in the time of\r\nillness, from the spout of one of these shells, is considered of greater\r\nefficacy than if taken from any other drinking vessel; that from the\r\nspout of a reversed shell has a reputation inestimable. These reversed\r\nshells occur so rarely, that if at any time some happy fortunate of the\r\nfishing tribe of Hindoos should be so lucky as to find one, he is indeed\r\nconsidered as a mortal favoured by their divinity Vishnu; this treasure\r\nof the deep is immediately deposited in one of their pagodas, to the\r\ngreat honour and happiness of the discoverer. A dose of medicine from\r\nsuch a shell is deemed infallible, if the malady of the patient be\r\nwithin the art of medicine to cure; for if this should fail, they rest\r\npersuaded nothing else can save the patient from the death awaiting him.\r\n\r\nAs these reversed shells are of very rare occurrence, the price they\r\nbear is of course of considerable. Very few of the Pagodas possess such\r\nan inestimable treasure as a _Chank reversed_, they will command a price\r\nin Asia surpassing infinitely any idea that might probably be formed\r\nupon the subject. Four or five hundred dollars have been given in China,\r\namong the worshippers of Brahma, for a shell of this kind. In India they\r\nhave been known to produce from one hundred to two hundred rupees,\r\nsometimes, three, four, or five hundred rupees, or perhaps a larger sum.\r\nThe shells of this kind, which are purchased from the natives and\r\nbrought to Europe, it may be imagined, for this reason, can have been\r\nobtained only at a considerable cost. It was principally through the\r\nunrivalled liberality of the Conchologists of the low countries, about\r\nthe beginning of the last century, that the cabinets of Europe became\r\npossessed of these rarities, and they still remain extremely scarce.\r\n\r\nOnly two examples of those reversed shells have occurred to our\r\nobservation: both were of that kind in which the spire is elongated; the\r\nhigh spired Turnip Shell of the English cabinets. One of these reversed\r\nshells we saw in the year 1797, in the celebrated collection of Mon de\r\nCalonne, ci-devant Minister of France, and which passed, at a\r\nconsiderable price, into the collection of the Earl of Tankerville. The\r\nother occurred in the late Leverian Museum, which was distributed by\r\npublic auction, in the year 1806. This last-mentioned shell was in a\r\nless perfect condition than might be wished; it was worn and mutilated,\r\nand for this reason did not obtain by any means such a price as was\r\nexpected from its rarity: it produced only _seven guineas_, a sum\r\nconsidered much beneath its real value, even in its injured state.[16]\r\nIn the month of April, in the year 1815, the same shell appeared in the\r\nsale of certain effects, the property of the Duke de Bourbon, at his\r\nresidence in Great Ormond Street, Portman Square, where it was sold, we\r\nbelieve, at an advanced price. It is the figure of this last-mentioned\r\nshell that appears in the present plate. We have delineated the specimen\r\nwith all faults for the sake of greater accuracy, and from a persuasion\r\nthat the Naturalist would prefer a correct representation from an\r\nundoubted original, to any figure in which its actual defects might have\r\nbeen amended by the pencil of the artist. The shell is depicted in its\r\nnatural size, and it will hence appear, is little inferior in point of\r\nmagnitude to the generality of those shells of the same species which\r\nare not of the reversed kind. The species is sometimes known to grow to\r\nthe length of seven or eight inches, but such examples are not common.\r\nOf the reversed kinds the Leverian specimen, as it has been emphatically\r\ndenominated, is probably one of the largest known.\r\n\r\nThe smaller figure in the lower part of our plate is a representation of\r\nthe same species in its usual form, and appears clothed or covered with\r\nthe thick filmy epidermis, of a brown colour, with which the shell is\r\nnaturally covered when in a living state. From this figure it will be\r\nperceived that the direction of the spiral wreath or whorls in the\r\nlarger shell is exactly reversed, and that the mouth or aperture of the\r\nshell, which in the smaller figure appears on the right side, is seen in\r\nthe reversed shell on the left. Thus upon the least comparison of the\r\ntwo figures, the true character of the reversed shell will be distinctly\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nWe should not omit to mention that the smaller figure which represents\r\nthe unreversed shell would appear of the same pallid hue as the reversed\r\nshell, upon the removal of the epidermis with which it is enveloped.\r\nSometimes, however, when this common kind is particularly fine, the\r\nexterior surface is delicately tinged with a less pallid hue, and the\r\npillar lip and opening yellowish, inclined to flesh colour. That\r\nparticular kind or variety which in England is denominated the low\r\nspired or heavy Turnip Shell, is sometimes pleasingly diversified with\r\nmore vivid tints, and the younger shells occasionally spotted with\r\nbrown, upon a ground tinged with yellowish or buff colour. We have no\r\nknowledge of any reversed shell of this latter kind, excepting one which\r\nis in the Museum at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  The Hindoos entertain the belief of a general deluge, not very\r\n  dissimilar to that of the Mosaic records. They admit, however, many\r\n  such catastrophes of the earth, and subsequent renovations through the\r\n  creative power of this attribute of Brahma, which they denominate\r\n  Vishnu. The Chank Shell refers to a deluge of the earth, anterior to\r\n  that which seems to accord with the sacred writ. The deliverance of\r\n  the earth from the Mosaic deluge they term the lotos creation, the\r\n  type of which is the expanded flower of the lotos, the indian _pedma_\r\n  emerging above the surface of the waters with Vishnu seated in its\r\n  centre.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Were it requisite to treat more amply upon this subject, it would be\r\n  in our power to produce abundant evidence of the prevalence of this\r\n  symbol of the sacred Volute, wherever Vishnu or his delegated power\r\n  appears. The rich repository of the India House, the British Museum,\r\n  and many private collections afford us some examples of the most\r\n  interesting kind. Some few of these are so immediately connected with\r\n  the object of our enquiry, that we feel persuaded no apology will be\r\n  necessary for their introduction.\r\n\r\n  In the collection of Lord Valentia is a four-sided cast in brass,\r\n  resembling a kind of pyramid, consisting of three low platforms, each\r\n  bearing idols, and surmounted at the summit by a tortoise. In several\r\n  Indian paintings mythologically adverting to the subject of the\r\n  creation, the tortoise is represented raising the new-born earth upon\r\n  its back above the waters, and it is usually seen in other\r\n  mythological paintings of the same subject bearing the throne upon\r\n  which Vishnu is seated, while the attendants, personified by various\r\n  beings, are lifting the earth from the deep. Such a painting was once\r\n  in the celebrated collection of Colonel Stuart: and we need no other\r\n  evidence to shew that the bronze of Lord Valentia’s collection is of\r\n  the same mythological nature, and referable to the deluge, than to\r\n  observe the Chank Shell placed at each of the four corners of the\r\n  ornament. We may comprehend the allusion of the tortoise raising the\r\n  earth from the waters of the deluge, from a trait of the ancient\r\n  Chinese astronomy; by the tortoise bearing the earth, they intended\r\n  the north pole of the ecliptic, which, at the time of the deluge, they\r\n  maintained had not materially changed its position, and that by this\r\n  means the world was sustained and saved from utter annihilation.\r\n\r\n  An Indian painting, mentioned by Mr. Edward Moor, the author of the\r\n  Hindoo Pantheon, presents us with another deity, Sivi, who holds the\r\n  Chank Shell in one of his four hands, and the antelope (moon) in\r\n  another.\r\n\r\n  There is also an Indian painting of Devi, who appears holding a Chank\r\n  Shell, furnished on each side with a lateral lappit or wing: this\r\n  symbol he holds in one hand, and the wheel, the emblem of the\r\n  universe, in the other; and in a bronze of Vishnu, in the India House,\r\n  we find the Chank Shell ornamented in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n  We have seen another indian painting, in which, not only the Chank\r\n  Shell is furnished on each side with alæ, or wings, but an expanded\r\n  flower of six petals is placed upon its pinnacle. This shell, if we\r\n  may judge from its outline, is of that kind which has the spire\r\n  depressed. Lord Valentia is in possession of a bronze cast, in which\r\n  Vishnu appears reclined upon his couch of serpents, attended by\r\n  _Lakshmi_ and _Satyavama_, (eternity) in which the shell is also\r\n  winged, and appears to be of that kind in which the beak is elongated\r\n  or produced; and if this conjecture be correct, it will appear that\r\n  the Hindoos venerate indiscriminately, and probably as the same shell,\r\n  each of those three varieties of Voluta Pyrum, which we have mentioned\r\n  in another part of this description. Our limits will only permit us to\r\n  observe that we believe we may add with some degree of certainty, that\r\n  the reversed shell, the more immediate object of our present\r\n  dissertation, may sometimes appear also: there is in the temple of\r\n  _Visweswara_, at Benares, a sculpture of Surya, the Indian\r\n  personification of the sun, seated in his chariot driven by Aruna, in\r\n  which the _Chank Shell_ held in his right hand appears to have the\r\n  aperture on the left side instead of the right, as in the usual growth\r\n  of the shell. If this be not an oversight of the copyist (_Mr. Moor_)\r\n  the circumstance deserves peculiar notice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Vide Catalogue _Lev.

Some authors consider these two\r\nbirds as specifically different, while others are as well assured they\r\nare the same. Dr. Latham observes that these birds are, without doubt,\r\nthe same, differing only in sex, but which of them is the male is not\r\nascertained. Some of the French writers, among whom is Vieillot, express\r\na different opinion, for they assure us neither the female or the young\r\nare known, and they further add, that in the Brazils this bird is\r\ncommon, while in Guiana it is rare. Vieillot once regarded them as\r\ndistinct species, but has subsequently described them as the same. Both\r\nbirds, according to Dr. Latham, are from Cayenne; we have seen both\r\nkinds from the Brazils.\r\n\r\nThe size of this bird is that of the house sparrow: the rump is usually\r\ngreen, but in the blue headed variety, is sometimes flavous, more or\r\nless inclined to orange.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _24_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Fabricius described it as a new species, under the name\r\nof Papilio Thersites; his description refers to a specimen in the\r\ncabinet of Dr. Hunter, but he has omitted to insert his usual reference\r\nto the drawings of Mr. Jones, among which that specimen was delineated,\r\nand from which we are well aware the Fabrician description of the\r\nspecies is derived. It is from those drawings, also, that we have been\r\nenabled to determine the species with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this Papilio renders it an object of peculiar interest;\r\nit is one of the most conspicuous insects of its tribe, and in point of\r\nelegance cannot assuredly be considered inferior to any of its numerous\r\nspecies. In the plate accompanying this description, the Papilio is\r\nrepresented in its natural size: the whole disk is of a fine yellow\r\ncolour, with a deep black border: the posterior wings are marked with a\r\nseries of yellow lunules, and another of brilliant blue spots, composed\r\nof little shining dots, of which the brightest are in the centre.\r\nBeneath, the breast, abdomen, and wings, are yellow: margin of the\r\nanterior pair black with a yellow streak, and a black streak of spots on\r\nthe lower pair.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _25_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The New Zealand specimen, though it nearly\r\naccords with the bird described by Buffon under the name of Hupecol de\r\nCayenne, does not entirely agree with the description given of that\r\nspecies by Dr. Latham: it differs in wanting the white band on the rump,\r\nand the patch or space of the same colour on the lower region of the\r\nbelly. Buffon speaks of such a characteristic mark of white on the rump,\r\nbut not the abdomen of the Cayenne kind.[17] And it is not unlikely that\r\nthese appearances may be indications only of a change in plumage, as the\r\nsame circumstance is not unfrequently observed in many other birds at\r\nparticular seasons, or in certain states of moulting. Dr. Latham himself\r\nobserves that in the female these marks, instead of being white, incline\r\nto rufous, and this, no doubt, in the adult bird. There is certainly no\r\nappearance of white either upon the rump or region of the belly in the\r\nbird before us; and this example bears every appearance of having\r\narrived at its full maturity of plumage. Perhaps the bird from Cayenne\r\nhaving a white band on the rump and abdomen, may be, however, if not a\r\ndistinct variety, the more mature bird of the same species as that met\r\nwith by our circumnavigators at New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThere are species of this tribe more brilliant in colour and more richly\r\nvaried in the disposition of those colours, but assuredly none more\r\nsingular or pleasing in general aspect than the bird before us. In point\r\nof size the Tufted Humming Bird is one of the smallest species of its\r\nfamily, scarcely exceeding in that respect the figure delineated in the\r\nplate, for its total length is not above three inches, and its bulk\r\nproportionate. The head and upper part of the body, and also the wings\r\nabove, are green with a golden lustre; the tail greenish, changeable to\r\ntestaceous golden brown, and having the inner webs rufous. The throat is\r\nof a fine green colour, variable in different lights to a golden hue\r\nwith a yellow or a brown metallic lustre, and below that the whole of\r\nthe belly is a rich brown glossed with green and golden. On the head of\r\nthe male bird is a crest of pointed feathers of an orange or testaceous\r\nbrown colour, and on each side of the neck a tuft composed of elongated\r\nfeathers, differing in length, and having the tips of a dark but\r\nbrilliant green. These feathers the little creature has the power of\r\nraising or depressing at pleasure: when these are displayed in full\r\narray on each side of the green patch on the front of the neck, and the\r\ncrest stands erect, which is invariably the case when the bird is\r\noffended or surprised, the appearance of this bird is altogether\r\nremarkable. The female has neither the ruff on the neck nor the crest,\r\nand its colours are in general more obscure than in the male. The bill\r\nis of a moderate length and straight, the legs very short and the feet\r\ndiminutive.[18]\r\n\r\nIn the annexed plate this elegant little bird is seen perched upon a\r\ntuft of the\r\n\r\n                  JACQUINIA AURANTIA, THE AUSTRALASIAN\r\n                           ORANGE JACQUINIA,\r\n\r\nin blossom; a plant that inhabits the New Holland and New Zealand, and\r\nwhich flowered in the month of July in the present year, at Kew.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  “Le dessus du corps est d’un vert-sombre, qui jette quelques reflets\r\n  dorés: les parties inférieures ne présentent que des couleurs\r\n  rembrunies.” _Buffon_\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  A New Zealand specimen of this rare bird, lot 6286, sold for the sum\r\n  of £2 10s. in the Leverian sale.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _26_\r\n\r\n  _London.

In the Chinese seas, which it chiefly inhabits, the species is\r\nvery rare; it sometimes occurs upon the coasts of Coromandel, but\r\nsparingly, and in the other seas upon the coasts of India it is believed\r\nto be still more uncommon. These shells are, moreover, so very brittle\r\nthat they seldom occur perfect, and more especially the larger ones,\r\nwhich in almost every instance is abbreviated or imperfect at the point\r\nor apex. And, it may be also added that like _Voluta Pyrum_, the _Sacred\r\nChank Shell_, of which an explanation was given in a former plate, the\r\nWentletrap is one of the sacred shells of the worshippers of Brahma, and\r\nconsequently when found in fine condition, is sure to obtain a\r\nconsiderable price among the opulent devotees of that doctrine, the\r\nprevailing worship of the many millions of inhabitants that people\r\nIndia, China, and other vast regions of the continent of Asia. In China,\r\nshells of this kind, of a moderate size, are valued at from four to\r\nfive, or even ten dollars a piece, those are shells of about an inch and\r\na quarter in length, and such as exceed that size are considered in\r\nproportion valuable. In England a fine specimen about the same size last\r\nmentioned would be estimated in worth at little less than five guineas.\r\nThe celebrated Wentletrap of the Leverian Museum was about two inches\r\nlong, but as it exhibited little freshness of colour, it produced only\r\neleven pounds. Since that period another specimen, a trifle larger, and\r\nwith the same bleached or depauperated appearance in its tints of\r\ncolour, was sold at the public hammer for twenty seven pounds. This is\r\nthe highest price we have seen paid for a specimen of this curious\r\nshell: we have heard of fifty guineas being given by one collector for a\r\nshell of this kind. Considerable as this price may be deemed, it appears\r\nto have been exceeded in one, if not more instances, upon the continent.\r\nDenys de Montfort, speaking, as it may be presumed, of the low countries\r\nand France, informs us, that he has seen it sell, when the height or\r\nlength has exceeded two inches, at two thousand four hundred livres, or\r\none hundred Louis. It will be observed that he is alluding to shells\r\nabout the same size as that delineated in the annexed plate, the outline\r\nof which is from the Leverian specimen; the colouring amended from a\r\nsmaller but more recent shell.\r\n\r\nThese shells are of such a tender nature, and their colours so\r\nevanescent or so feebly fixed, that they almost constantly present a\r\nmutilated and bleached appearance. This is not, however, uniformly the\r\ncase; we have very recently had an opportunity of inspecting several\r\nspecimens of a moderate size, that were brought from China, and from\r\nthese we perceive that the Wentletrap, when in fine order, is of a pale\r\ntestaceous or rather fulvous hue; and inclining sometimes to yellowish.\r\nIn some few specimens the ground colour of the shell, instead of being\r\nuniform, appears sprinkled with pallid spots and dots of a rounded form.\r\nSometimes we are assured the colour inclines to rufous, or a reddish\r\ntint. Lamarck has this shell of a pale fulvous colour, with the ribs as\r\nusual, white, for he adopts this as part of the leading character of the\r\nspecies; his expression is “_pallide fulva_; _costis albis_.”\r\n\r\nThe animal inhabitant of this shell has the head armed with two feelers,\r\neach ending in a setaceous thread or hair: the eye is placed upon the\r\ntentacula at the base of this thread or hair, and it has also a kind of\r\ntrunk at the mouth, by means of which it searches for its food amongst\r\nthe sand and weeds. It is supposed to be of a carnivorous nature,\r\nsubsisting on other marine worms. It is considered rather as a littoral\r\nspecies, frequenting the little sandy bays and creeks among the breakers\r\nupon the lower parts of the sea shore, and is to be sought for with the\r\nmost probability of success among the sea weeds or fuci that grow in the\r\npools of water lying in these sunken rocks, because in such situations\r\nit is most likely to find protection against the intrusion of the\r\nboisterous element. Occasionally it is seen, though rarely, crawling on\r\nthe sands at low water.\r\n\r\nIn a natural classification of the shell tribe, should we ever arrive at\r\nan arrangement of Conchology, so perfect as to deserve that epithet, it\r\nwould be a task of some difficulty to fix the precise station of the\r\nWentletrap; for in the order of nature it presents anomalies which\r\ncannot easily be reconciled, and few authors are agreed upon this\r\nsubject even in the artificial arrangements which they have been induced\r\nto adopt. Thus Rumpfius makes it a _Buccinum_, Davila a _Tuyau_,\r\nArgenville places it as a _Terebra_ (vis) and De Montfort Scalarus. In\r\nthe Encyclopædia it is denominated Scalaria Pretiosa, and this name\r\nLamarck retains.\r\n\r\nThe name of Wentletrap, by which this shell is now so well known, is\r\nderived from the Dutch Language, and signifies according to the\r\ntechnical phraseology of the Dutch architects in building, a winding\r\nstair case, or flight of stairs turning spirally round a central column,\r\ninto which one end of every step is mortised as they ascend from the\r\nbase upwards. The term Wentletrap, Wenteltrap, or as the Dutch sometimes\r\ncall it, Wendeltrap,[19] is the name given by Rumpfius the Hollander to\r\nthis shell, as a synonymous name with his latin term _Scalare_. It is an\r\nallusion, somewhat fanciful we must allow, to the disposition of the\r\ncostal ridges upon this shell, and which when viewed laterally as they\r\ntraverse or pass over the upper convexity of the whorls on each side,\r\nhave the appearance of a flight of steps turning spirally round the body\r\nof the shell, just as a winding staircase would be carried spirally\r\nround a cone or sub-cylindrical body. The singularity of this species\r\n(for it is not a peculiarity or character even of the new genus Scalaria\r\nas established by Lamarck and Cuvier) consists in having the whole whorl\r\nof the shell, from the mouth to the summit, entirely unconnected, while\r\nin spiral shells the suture of the whorls is united throughout. The tube\r\nis perfectly detached from the mouth to the apex, and the whorls linked\r\ntogether only by means of the longitudinal ribs which traverse the tube\r\nat regular intervals, so that the only connexion of the whorls is at the\r\njunction of those ribs, which touching each other unite at that part\r\nwhich in regular spiral shells that have the whorls united, would be\r\ndenominated the suture of the whorls.\r\n\r\nConsidering the very zealous propensity of some French Naturalists of\r\nthe present day, and of their admirers in England, to create new genera\r\nupon every slight occasion, it becomes a matter of some astonishment\r\nthat a character so very obvious as the disjunction of the tube from the\r\naperture to the very summit should not have laid the foundation of a new\r\ngenus, for the reception of this shell. Lamarck, however, places it at\r\nthe head of his _Scalaires_, and one of the next species in succession\r\nis his _Scalaria Communis_, a shell perfectly well known by every\r\nNaturalist throughout Europe for nearly a century past under the name of\r\n_Turbo Clathratus_.[20] Nor is Lamarck singular in this very anomalous\r\nconsolidation of shells so distant in this respect from each other; for\r\nCuvier in his _Règne Animal_, after describing our present shell, the\r\nLinnæan Turbo Scalaris, as one of his _Scalaires_, and informing us it\r\nis distinguished by the whorls not touching each other, adds\r\nparticularly that there is another species which has not that\r\npeculiarity, and that is the _Turbo Clathratus_. Nothing, however, can\r\nbe more certain than that from this very circumstance these two shells\r\nare generically distinct from each other; Clathratus may be retained\r\nwith the Linnæan Turbines, but Scalaris has nearly, if not entirely as\r\nmuch claim to the _Serpula_[21] as _Turbo_ genus; which cannot be said\r\nof T. Clathratus. We shall for this reason allow the Wentletrap to\r\nremain where Linnæus has placed it, namely, among the Turbines; not\r\nperhaps without some hesitation, but if we did remove it, we should\r\ncertainly prefer the institution of new genus for its reception, instead\r\nof wandering from one anomaly to another, as we must perceive would be\r\nthe case in the present instance by following the example of Lamarck and\r\nCuvier.\r\n\r\nIt may be lastly observed that the progressive growth of this\r\nextraordinary rarity may be determined by the greater number of the\r\nlongitudinal ribs that pass over and surround the tube of the whorls,\r\nfor at each increase the animal forms a new mouth to its shell: the new\r\nmouth as it is protruded and formed, appears like the former ones,\r\nentirely surrounded by a rim or ring, and it is these rings of the\r\nmouths as they are formed in succession, that constitute the ribs which\r\nappear to traverse the shell as it is increased in length, and\r\nconsequently in the number of its rings. Shells of a large size exhibit\r\nsometimes as many as fifty or sixty of such rings surrounding the tube\r\nor spire at regular intervals.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  _Wenteltrap_, _Wendeltrap_, Rondom gaande trap, met een spil daar al\r\n  de trappen in schroeven. _Marin._\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Donovan’s British Shells, Vol. I. plate 28.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  _Serpula_ Linn. _Vermicularus De Montf. Vermet_ Adanson. The animal of\r\n  the Serpulæ, it may be added further, does not differ, according to\r\n  Cuvier, from those of the Linnæan Genus Turbo, and consequently not\r\n  from Scalaria of Lamarck and Cuvier, as must be concluded from their\r\n  admission of Turbo Clathratus among the number of its species, in an\r\n  arrangement founded on the organization of the animal, as well as its\r\n  testaceous habitation. Cuvier himself observes that the animal of the\r\n  Vermet, and also the opening (of the shell) resemble those of the\r\n  Turbo, but that the whorls do not touch, and are in part irregularly\r\n  curved like the tubes of the Serpulas.—_Règne Animal T. 2. 419._ And\r\n  his classification further shews the analogy of these tribes of\r\n  shells, since the animal of the Linnæan _Turbo_, the _Vermets_ of\r\n  Adanson, and _Scalaria_ of Lamarck, are all of the same family, the\r\n  _Gastéropodas Pectinibranches_ of Cuvier.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _27_\r\n\r\n  _London.

This is\r\nindeed a circumstance to which we cannot advert too frequently in our\r\nreferences, since it is upon that authority alone that we are now\r\nenabled to determine with any degree of precision nearly the whole of\r\nthose new species of Papiliones, the existence of which has been made\r\nknown throughout Europe by the classic writings of that author, but of\r\nwhich no other evidence is now extant; for most of the collections\r\nexisting at the time Fabricius was in England, and to which he refers,\r\nhave been long since dispersed, and but for the care of the late Mr.\r\nJones of Chelsea, who had preserved these invaluable authorities to the\r\nscientific world, the labours even of Fabricius in this department had\r\nbecome comparatively of very little value.\r\n\r\nPapilio Zacynthus is a species of the first family of Papiliones, the\r\nEquites Trojani. It has much the habit of Papilio Æneas, a well known\r\ninsect, described by Linnæus, and which is figured by Roesel, Seba,\r\nJablonsky, and some other authors; but upon an attentive comparison it\r\nwill be found to be very different. Its great similarity renders it of\r\nmore importance to point out precisely the difference that prevails\r\nbetween them, and this the present figure it is presumed will render\r\ndistinctly obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the species P. Zacanthus the wings are black: in the middle of the\r\nfirst pair is a large spot composed of two distinct colours, the\r\nanterior part being white, the posterior green, but on the underside the\r\nspot appears entirely white. Papilio Æneas has also a spot of green upon\r\nthe anterior wings but without any portion of white. Papilio Æneas is a\r\nnative of India, Papilio Zacynthus is from the Brasils.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FIGURE II.\r\n\r\n                             PAPILIO DIMAS\r\n                           DIMAS’S BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\n                                 ORDER\r\n                              LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nAntennæ thicker towards the tip, and generally terminating in a knob:\r\nwings erect when at rest.

Fabricius, it\r\nappears, was not entirely decided in his mind whether the two Papiliones\r\nfigured by Cramer, plate 29 fig. E, under the name of Hyppason, and that\r\nin the same plate, fig. F, named Euristeus, ought in reality to be\r\nconsidered as appertaining to this species; and preferring the name of\r\nDimas which had been previously given to it by Mr. Jones, he has\r\ndescribed it under that name, allowing the references to Cramer, above\r\nquoted, to remain as synonyms. The Naturalist may rely with implicit\r\nconfidence upon its being the Papilio Dimas of Jones and Fabricius.\r\n\r\nThis is rather larger than the former, the general colour black: on the\r\nanterior wings, in the middle, is a large white spot, so situated upon\r\nthe junction of the ribs that they pass distinctly through it and give\r\nthe appearance of a spot cleft at the sutures. The sanguineous palmate\r\nspot on the posterior wings is six cleft: and besides this there is a\r\nsmall spot of red upon the scollops, between the dentations at the\r\nmargin of the posterior wings.

The\r\ndiscovery of this shell, like that of many others, resulted from the\r\nassiduities of that eminent Naturalist and promoter of scientific\r\nknowledge, the late Sir Joseph Banks, and of Dr. Solander, who\r\naccompanied him in that memorable voyage of Captain Cook to the Southern\r\nHemisphere, in which the Friendly Isles were discovered. The fine\r\nexample of this shell, in particular, from which the drawing in our\r\nplate is taken, it may be also added, was one of those which were\r\nbrought to this country by Captain Cook upon the return of the\r\nexpedition, and which being shortly after presented to Sir Ashton Lever,\r\nremained in the Museum of that distinguished amateur from that period to\r\nthe time of its dissolution in the year 1806.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the very remote situation of those islands, so distant\r\nfrom the usual track of all navigators, we cannot be surprised,\r\nadmitting the species to be local in those seas, to find it has remained\r\na very rare shell from the period of its discovery to the present time.\r\nIn the course of many years only a few specimens have occurred to our\r\nobservation, and while it has remained scarce with us, it appears to\r\nhave been still more uncommon in the continental cabinets: very few of\r\nwhich, if we are informed correctly, were lately in possession of it.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty that arises in the mind of the naturalist upon the\r\ninspection of this shell results from the ambiguity of its generical\r\npeculiarities: we pause to consider where it should be placed. Linnæus,\r\nto whom, as it will be observed, the present shell was totally unknown,\r\narranged the Hammer Shell, its nearest approximation, among the Ostreæ.\r\nThe Hammer Shell, or as it is more usually denominated the Hammer Oyster\r\nShell, had been discovered before the time of Linnæus; it had appeared\r\nin the work of Rumpfius, Seba, Gualtieri and Argenville, and the shell\r\nhad been examined and described by him in the Museum of Ulrica, Queen of\r\nSweden, under the name of Ostrea Malleus. That the hinge accords in some\r\ndegree with that of the Ostreæ generally must be admitted, at the same\r\ntime that it possesses other characters less easily reconciled to that\r\ngenus, unless we embrace the Linnæan genus in all its latitude, and to\r\nthis the conchologist of the present day cannot accede, at least without\r\nsome little difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe conformation of this shell is very striking, and yet we perceive\r\nthat its essential characteristics are less definitive than could be\r\nwished; there are several approximations in the general figure to be\r\nfound among shells which nevertheless possess characters generically\r\ndistinct. For many years this shell was known in this country under the\r\nname of “_Margaritifera maculata_,” and the trivial English appellation\r\nof the “_Spotted Hound’s Tongue_:” it appeared under those names in the\r\nConchological Museum of M. de Calonne, while it remained in England, and\r\nin the catalogue of that museum, which is still extant, it will be found\r\nunder those names. The epithet of Hound’s Tongue is not inaptly applied\r\nto this shell, in allusion to the elongated form. The term Margaritifera\r\ndoes not refer to the form, but to the pearly gloss that appears upon\r\nthe surface of the dark blue space lying within the shell, immediately\r\nbelow the hinge, and extending from thence about one fourth part of its\r\nwhole length. This is the region in which the animal is attached by its\r\nligament to the valves of the shell; besides which, a gloss of pearly\r\nhue is observed to pervade the whole of the inner surface, only that it\r\nis most conspicuous in the darker disk of the shell. As a secondary\r\ncharacter this pearliness is very remarkable in the shell before us, at\r\nthe same time that as a generical denomination the term Margaritifera\r\nassigned to it from this circumstance alone is liable to objection;\r\nbecause, the same pearliness prevails in many shells which have no\r\nrelation whatever with the present, either in the form or structure of\r\nthe hinge, and it is to these we must resort for its true essential\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLamarck constitutes many genera of the shells included in the Ostrea\r\ngenus of Linnæus. His Malléacées comprehend five genera, Crenatula,\r\nPerna, Malleus, Avicula, and Meleagrina, all which are allied more or\r\nless remotely to the shell before us. To that particular family which is\r\nknown among collectors by the designation of Hammer Oysters, he gives\r\nthe name of Malleus, in the French Marteau, both alike implying the\r\nhammer like form of the species Malleus, which Lamarck assumes as the\r\ntype of this genus. But even there after all the renovation that has\r\nbeen attempted, the result is not satisfactory, because this figure is\r\nby no means constant, even in the few species included by its author in\r\nthat genus; it contains but six species, and these are entirely at\r\nvariance with each other. Thus for example, in Malleus Vulgaris, the\r\ncommon Hammer Shell, we have a species with three lobes, a lateral one\r\nof considerable size being advanced on each side the beaks: and another\r\nshell of the same species with only short lateral lobes instead of large\r\nones. Admitting the hammer form to be still preserved in these, in the\r\nnext species, Malleus Normalis, instead of two lobes, the hammer head,\r\nif it may be so expressed, has but a single lobe: in Malleus Anatinus\r\nthere is only one lobe, and that very small; and in Malleus Vulsellatus,\r\nalthough characterised as “_lobo oblique porrecto_,” the appearance of\r\nthe shell implies rather the total absence of any lobe, for the lobe, if\r\nso it may be termed, is so indefinite, that it cannot be referred\r\nwithout violence to the genus Marteau, while we consider its hammer like\r\nform as a leading character of the genus. With exception to this\r\ninconstant character which may be qualified with the expression\r\n“deformed and generally hammer shaped,” we have no objection to the\r\nMalleus genus, because the byssus of the animal by means of which it can\r\naffix itself to other bodies, and the peculiar sinus or sulcation of the\r\nhinge through which the byssus passes from the animal to those\r\nextraneous bodies, are sufficient to remove it from the Ostrea genus, in\r\nwhich case if we still adhere to the Linnæan method we can place it only\r\namong his Mytili or Pinnæ, and it has certainly less affinity with\r\neither of those than with Ostrea. Perhaps the name of Perna under which\r\nthis shell has been mentioned a few years ago might have been as well\r\npreserved, but that name Lamarck assigns to an extensive genus of which\r\nOstrea Isognomum is the type, and it is therefore better to retain the\r\nname Malleus than to alter it to another which could not fail at this\r\ntime to create confusion. The same consequence would as unquestionably\r\nresult were we to sub-divide the Malléacées into different genera\r\naccording to the configuration of the shell or number of its lateral\r\nlobes.\r\n\r\nThe definition of Malleus in the _Règne Animal_ of Cuvier appears to\r\nintimate the same objection; it does not consider the hammer like form\r\nof the shell as any criterion, it is only stated that the Marteaux are\r\ninequivalve and irregular, that they have a simple hollow for the\r\nligament as in the oysters, but that they are distinguished by a slope\r\nat the side of the ligament for the passage of the byssus.\r\n\r\nIt is assuredly true that the presence of a byssus in this tribe of\r\nshells displaces them from any immediate analogy with the Ostrea, where\r\nas Cuvier remarks “Linnæus left them.” But, if however, we attentively\r\nexamine the hinge of the common oyster, the two valves, and the oyster\r\nas it lies within the valves, we shall perceive with this exception a\r\npretty near approximation. The great objection is, that the animal of\r\nthe tribe of shells now before us protrudes a byssus from its body\r\nthrough a lateral opening on one side or slope of the ligament of the\r\nhinge; if we closely inspect the valves of the oyster, we also find a\r\nslight depression or hollow upon each side of the cartilage of the\r\nhinge; these are small, and usually somewhat lamellar. The oyster,\r\nmoreover, as it lies in the shell, seems capable of expanding or\r\nspreading that part of the body which lies under the hinge laterally\r\nupon and into these depressions, a circumstance very easily observed in\r\nthe half famished oyster, because these lateral expansions of the animal\r\nare then more visibly elongated along the passage of these lateral\r\ngrooves of the hinge, and give the pointed end of the animal a somewhat\r\ncornuted appearance. Under the same circumstance these processes adhere\r\nas they lie in the hollow of these grooves, and thus suggests the idea\r\nof the animal having exerted itself by such extension to obtain\r\nrefreshment through these lateral hollows. Those hollows are also so far\r\npervious as to admit the ingress of moisture while the shells are\r\nclosed, in the same manner as it is possible the Malleus genus may\r\nreceive moisture under the same circumstance through the sinus, whence\r\nthe byssus is protruded. These peculiarities considered, may perhaps\r\nafford some further justification of Linnæus in placing the hammer\r\nshells with the Ostreæ. It has been indeed advanced that Linnæus was not\r\naware of these hammer shells being furnished with a byssus, or that he\r\nwould have referred them to the Mytili, but this observation cannot be\r\ncorrect, because in the figure given of these shells by Seba, to which\r\nLinnæus refers, the byssus, which is very conspicuous, is represented\r\npendent or hanging to a considerable length out of the shell.\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive examination of the different Conchological authors, it\r\ndoes not appear to us that the shell before us has hitherto been\r\nfigured, and we have reason also to believe that it has never been\r\ndescribed. These circumstances are the more probable since, as we have\r\nbefore observed, the shell is at this time very little known among the\r\nContinental Cabinets. The nearest approach, so far as we can judge from\r\nthe description, unassisted by any figure, is the Marteau Normal\r\n(Malleus Normalis) of Lamarck, a species defined by him as _testa\r\nbiloba_; _lobo basis unico anticali ad normam_, our shell is certainly\r\nbilobate, for it has only one lateral lobe at the beak, and that\r\nmoreover advances from the beak, pretty nearly, though not exactly, in a\r\nright line; but its general description does not sufficiently accord\r\nwith our shell to authorise as a conclusion that they are the same.\r\nLamarck informs us that there are two varieties of his Malleus Normalis,\r\none of which is a native of the ocean of the Great Indies, the other of\r\nthe seas of New Holland. The first, or Indian kind, he describes as\r\nbeing on the inside as well as outside of a black colour, with a longish\r\nlobe at the base of the shell.[22] The New Holland kind is described of\r\na whitish colour, with the lobe at the base abbreviated.[23]\r\n\r\nThe two last-mentioned shells which Lamarck concludes to be varieties of\r\nthe same species, may perhaps prove hereafter to be species distinct\r\nfrom each other, as Lamarck has himself shewn to be the case with\r\nrespect to the common black and the white hammer shells. The black\r\nsupposed variety of Malleus Normalis we apprehend to be distinct from\r\nthe shell before us, but it is possible that the New Holland shell which\r\nhe describes as being whitish, with the lobe at the base abbreviated,\r\nmay be a worn or much depauperated specimen of our present shell; it\r\ncertainly does not accord with our shell in any tolerable state of\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nLamarck says nothing of any ruddiness or testaceous hues in his New\r\nHolland variety of _Normalis_, and admitting these colours to indicate\r\nthat the shell had been found with its animal in a living state, we can\r\nscarcely conceive the dark fuscous spotting which is so conspicuous in\r\nthe species could by any ordinary accident be so entirely obliterated as\r\nappears to be the case in Lamarck’s specimen, if his New Holland variety\r\nof Malleus Normalis be really of this species; and it may be further\r\nadded that if our present shell was actually intended by his Malleus\r\nNormalis, the defects of his shell has necessarily influenced his\r\nspecific character and rendered it imperfect.\r\n\r\nWe have not adverted to Malleus Anatinus of Chemnitz, because the figure\r\nof that shell is ambiguous. There is a remote resemblance in the lateral\r\nappendages of the beaks, but in other particulars the resemblance is\r\nless obvious, the body is sometimes curved as in the shell before us and\r\nsometimes straight, but the edges of the valves are parallel, and the\r\nshell itself pellucid: the figure in Chemnitz is less than half the size\r\nof our shell. This inhabits the seas of Timor and the Nicobar Islands.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed in conclusion that there is a specimen of our\r\nspecies among the Hammer Shells in the British Museum, the _habitat_ of\r\nwhich is indicated by the word “Amboina:” it is much smaller than our\r\nshell. Besides this we have lately seen another example from New\r\nHolland, of a growth still larger than the shell we have delineated.\r\n\r\nWe have entered thus minutely into the analogies of this shell from an\r\napprehension we might otherwise in this instance submit as a new species\r\nan object that had been previously described. The result of our enquiry\r\nwill tend to shew that if the species has not remained entirely\r\nunnoticed, it has never been described with much precision.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  Testa extus intusque nigra: lobo basis longiusculo. _Animaux sans\r\n  vertèbres.

This tribe, as its designation implies, has been\r\ndedicated by Entomologists to the memory of the more distinguished\r\nworthies of the Trojan race, and above others to preserve the memory of\r\nthose heroes whose exploits in the defence of that rich and potent\r\nstation of the ancient world, the town of Troy, has been commemorated in\r\nthe Iliad by the immortal Homer. Our present species refers indeed to a\r\nTrojan of an earlier period; it is named after Tros, the founder of the\r\nTrojan name. Tros was the fifth king of the Trojan dynasty, from its\r\nfirst establishment in the person of Scamander, and the last but three;\r\nthe destruction of Troy being accomplished under the reign of Priam. The\r\ncountry before the time of Tros was called Dardania, from Dardanus, who\r\nis usually stiled the first of the Trojan kings, though in Phrygia he\r\nwas preceded by Scamander and Teucer. Tros lived about fourteen hundred\r\nyears before the Christian Era, and reigned king of Troy for the space\r\nof sixty years. It is in honour of this Trojan Monarch that Fabricius\r\nhas given the present insect the name of Papilio Tros.\r\n\r\nThere are several Papiliones which bear a nearer or more distant\r\nresemblance to this Papilio, a circumstance that will impose some\r\ncaution upon the Entomologist before he can venture to pronounce upon\r\nthe species with decision: its characters are nevertheless sufficiently\r\nconspicuous, and when examined with due attention, enables us to\r\ndetermine the species from its nearest approximations, in a clear and\r\nsatisfactory manner. The wings are dark above as well as beneath, the\r\ndeeper colouring prevailing, however, on the upper surface as well as\r\nbeneath; the anterior wings are marked with a broad abbreviated whitish\r\nband, and the lower wings with a large sanguineous or blood red spot of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. This sanguineous spot from lying in the disk of\r\nthe wing is traversed and divided by the black nerves of the wing in\r\nsuch a manner as to appear in the form of six distinct oblong spots,\r\nplaced laterally to each other: these spots appear also on the lower\r\nsurface, in the same form as above, but the colour is rather paler.\r\n\r\nAs there is no figure extant of this large and fine Papilio in the work\r\nof any author, the delineation which we have the pleasure on this\r\noccasion to submit before our readers will doubtlessly be viewed with\r\npeculiar satisfaction. It need be only added that the species has been\r\ndefinitively determined upon the authority of Mr. Jones’s collection of\r\noriginal drawings, to which Fabricius so constantly refers, and that for\r\nthis reason its specific appellation may be implicitly upon by the\r\nscientific Entomologist.\r\n\r\nThis interesting Papilio is a native of Brazil.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _30_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The species we have selected for our present representation\r\nis one of the smaller kinds of the family distinguished by the name of\r\nParrakeets. Its total length is about six inches, its form robust or\r\nbulky in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe bill and legs of this bird are usually described as being dusky, in\r\nour specimen the bill is rather pale, tinged with brown and greenish,\r\nand the legs inclining to flesh colour. The general colour of the head\r\nand neck is green, and the same colour prevails on the breast, belly,\r\nand thighs. Upon the crown of the head the green assumes a blueish tint,\r\nand on the neck appears enlivened with yellowish, the disk of a number\r\nof the feathers being of a yellow colour, with the edges brown, so as to\r\npresent a kind of scolloped appearance. The back and wing coverts are\r\ndeep black, with a somewhat velvet aspect; the greater quill feathers\r\nblack. But one of the characters by which it is distinguished chiefly is\r\nthe remarkable band of yellow, and its contiguous parallel band of blue\r\nby which the wings are traversed. This conspicuous band is formed by the\r\nsecondary quill feathers, which being of a fine yellow, with the ends a\r\nlively blue, appear like two distinct bands, and from their gaiety of\r\ncolouring are admirably relieved by the deep sable hues of the wings and\r\nback. In the bird before us the black colour of the back extends nearly\r\nto the tail, the ends of the tail coverts only being green. The most\r\nsingular contrast in the appearance of its plumage arises from the very\r\ndifferent colour of the tail: this is of a pale carnation, glossed or\r\nchangeable to a delicate violet. The tail, with the exception of the two\r\nmiddle feathers, is traversed near the tip with a single broad band of\r\nblack; the two middle feathers are of the same pale carnation colour as\r\nthe rest, but rather more inclined to blueish.\r\n\r\nThe black winged Parrot is described as a native of Batavia and Luzonia.\r\nOur specimen we are assured is from the Brazils. We have also very\r\nlately had an opportunity of consulting an extensive series of drawings,\r\nrepresenting the principal Natural productions of Surinam, made by an\r\nEnglishman resident upon the spot, for his own amusement, and among\r\nthose drawings have met with one of the black winged Parrakeet. Upon\r\nthis authority we have no hesitation in pronouncing it to be a native of\r\nSurinam; and indeed it seems to be so well known in that part of the\r\nworld that it is distinguished among the inhabitants by a peculiar name,\r\nit is called by them _Ajàlàlero_.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _31_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Thus the present interesting insect is dedicated to\r\ncommemorate among the votaries of science, the name of Hippodamia, a\r\nnymph feigned by the poets to be the daughter of Oenomaiis, and who\r\naccording to the legends of classic lore, besides being much celebrated\r\nfor her beauty, was distinguished for her swiftness in the race; and at\r\nlength bestowed her fair hand in marriage upon Pelops, because in speed\r\nhe excelled her.\r\n\r\nThis insect, which is of a moderate size, is of a light and elegant\r\nstructure. The wings are black, but the transparent spots occupy so much\r\nspace that the sable colouring does not appear predominant; it is less\r\nprevalent in the posterior than the anterior wings, and yet less upon\r\nthe under surface than the upper. The form and disposition of these\r\ntransparent spots with which the dark colour of this fly is variegated,\r\nare altogether characteristic, and deserve particular attention, because\r\nthere are other insects of the same tribe which pretty nearly resemble\r\nit. From the middle of the anterior wing extends a transparent spot of a\r\nvery elongated heart shaped form, having the point directed to the\r\nthorax, and a bar of black crossing it at the broader end, so as to give\r\nit the appearance of two distinct spots; and beyond this is another\r\nhyaline spot about the same size as the larger one of the two\r\ntransparent spaces of which the first-mentioned spot consists. The\r\nposterior part of the wing is further marked with two bands of the same\r\ntransparent texture as the others, each consisting of three distinct\r\nspots. The lower wings present a larger transparent space than the upper\r\nwings, the whole disk being hyaline with only the posterior limb or\r\nborder opake, and of a black colour. The thorax and body is black.\r\n\r\nThe hyaline spots as seen on the under side are of the same size and\r\nform as they appear above, but the opake spaces instead of being\r\nuniformly black as on the upper surface, are agreeably diversified with\r\nrufous and geminous dots of white: these double white dots are situated\r\non the black border at the tips of the wings, three on that of the\r\nanterior pair, and three on that of the posterior ones.\r\n\r\nFrom the very close analogy that prevails between this and several other\r\nspecies of the same tribe, it would, no doubt, have been a matter of\r\nconsiderable difficulty at this time to determine the Fabrician species\r\nPapilio Hippodamia with precision, if we had not possessed the means of\r\nreference to the Fabrician manuscripts, and the drawings in which it is\r\ndelineated; for it has remained to this period unfigured by any author.\r\nIt will be observed that Fabricius does not refer for this species to\r\nthe Collectanea of Mr. Jones, as in many other instances. The cause of\r\nthis omission will admit of a very easy explanation; Fabricius had seen\r\nthe insect in the first instance in the cabinet of M. Mauduit, at Paris,\r\nto which he has referred. But subsequently when in England he found a\r\ndrawing of the insect in the collection of Mr. Jones, and inscribed the\r\nname and character of the species upon the drawing, as it afterwards\r\nappeared in his Entomologia Systematica; and it is upon this authority\r\nthat we are enabled to speak with certainty upon a species which, but\r\nfor this circumstance, would be now involved in ambiguity. The figures\r\nin our plate are copied from the drawings of Mr. Jones, inscribed with\r\nthe hand-writing of Fabricius.\r\n\r\nAt the time Fabricius described this species its _habitat_ was unknown:\r\nwe have lately met with it in a collection of Brasilian insects, and\r\nentertain no doubt of its having been brought with the rest from that\r\npart of the globe.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _32_\r\n\r\n  _London.

But a few years only have\r\npassed away, since the mantle decorations of the fire place in the\r\napartments of fashion, besides images and jars of china porcellain,\r\nconsisted of shells, among which the various kinds of Cowries were not\r\nesteemed the least ornamental. And they are sometimes still seen in such\r\nsituations; while the grotesque statuary, the josses, and the dragons,\r\nof China and Japan, in conformity with a better taste, have wholly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the Cypræa, genus which are most familiar to the\r\ngenerality of observers, are the spotted Cowries, and some others of\r\nusual occurrence. There are others which from their rarity are less\r\nextensively known, and among the number we may truly rank the species\r\nwhich we have now before us, the Orange Cowry, or as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, the “Morning Dawn.” The beauty of this shell, as well as\r\nscarcity, has established its celebrity; the species is well known, but\r\nfew collections, excepting those of the more costly kind, possess the\r\nshell. Its magnitude is considerable, for its size is nothing inferior\r\nto that of the Spotted Cowry, which ranks in this respect the chief\r\nspecies of its family, while the distinction of its colour from that of\r\nall other shells of the Cypræa tribe at once attracts particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the back in this species is of a very fine orange, simple,\r\nand unadorned with any marks or spots whatever. The tint of orange\r\nvaries in different shells from pale to darker, but whatever may be its\r\ndeviations in this respect, the tint of colour is constantly deepest\r\nupon the back, and the transition as constantly becoming gradually paler\r\nor more diluted as the colour descends upon the sides towards the\r\nmargin. This margin is rounded, projecting, and of a pure white, except\r\nat the throat, as it is termed, where a tint of red or reddish prevails\r\nto a small extent. The under surface of the shell is white, except at\r\nthe sides where the orange colour of the back descends, spreads, and\r\nfades away into the white. The aperture of the shell is a longitudinal\r\nopening down the middle as usual in the other kinds of Cowry; the\r\nsurrounding region of the shell is a pure white, but the edges of the\r\nopening, both which are beset with numerous linear teeth, are of a fine\r\norange.\r\n\r\nFor the discovery of this extremely beautiful shell, like many other\r\nacquisitions of importance in the cabinet of the Conchologist, we stand\r\nindebted to the assiduities of that eminent Naturalist Sir Joseph Banks,\r\nand those who accompanied him in the celebrated voyage of Captain Cook\r\nround the world. They observed it among the ornaments with which the\r\nnatives of Otaheite had decorated their dresses, which were composed of\r\nfeathers, and the barks of trees. To these garments they were attached\r\nby means of a string passing through a hole perforated for the purpose\r\non one side of the shell. The natives were not so easily induced to part\r\nwith these shells as the other decorations of their clothing,\r\nappreciating them at a much higher value. Our navigators were at first\r\nled to imagine these shells to be inhabitants of the seas surrounding\r\nOtaheite, in which particular they were at length undeceived by the\r\nnatives who informed them to the contrary: they said the shells were\r\nfound near an island at a great distance from Otaheite, and from the\r\ndirection of the spot toward which they pointed, it was conjectured they\r\nmeant the Fegee or Fidgi Islands, which are inhabited by the most\r\nferocious cannibals throughout those seas.[24] Our navigators were\r\ntherefore able only to procure such specimens as were attached to the\r\ndresses of the natives, and these being almost constantly perforated for\r\nthe better convenience of fastening them on safely, at once explains the\r\nreason of the Orange Cowry being so rarely met with undisfigured by such\r\nperforation.\r\n\r\nThe mention of this circumstance, which at this distant period can be\r\nlittle known, is moreover of some importance, because as the shells were\r\nreally brought from Otaheite, it has been generally supposed to be a\r\nnative of that island, and has even sometimes been called the Otaheitan\r\nCowry. Gmelin, who records this shell under the name of Cypræa\r\nAurantium, speaks of it as a native of the Friendly Isles, “habitat ad\r\ninsulas amicas,” resting his authority, we apprehend, upon the\r\nConchology of Martyn, and which though published shortly after the\r\nreturn of Captain Cook, could not be so well informed upon the subject\r\nas the venerable friend who assured us it is neither a native of\r\nOtaheite, nor the Friendly Islands. Lamarck has subsequently observed\r\nthat the species inhabits the seas of the Friendly Islands as well as\r\nthose of Otaheite, and also of New Zealand. Upon what authority the\r\n_localities_ have been increased to this extent is not stated. We have\r\nunderstood from very good authority that researches have been made\r\nrepeatedly of late years by our navigators to discover the shells in\r\nthose seas, and without effect; and this fact appears to be confirmed\r\nfrom the increasing value and importance attached to the species. We are\r\nindeed not entirely certain that any of these shells have ever been\r\nprocured, except as before observed from among the natives of Otaheite,\r\nand the value of the shell has progressively advanced in consequence\r\nfrom four, or five, to ten pounds. A specimen in the collection of Mrs.\r\nAngus sold about three years ago in London for twenty guineas; thirty\r\nguineas have been in vain offered for another specimen within the last\r\ntwo or three years, and a collector at this period in London is in\r\npossession of another which it is understood cost him very lately fifty\r\nguineas. These circumstances, if we mistake not, conspire to prove, that\r\nthe Orange Cowry is a far more local species than might be inferred from\r\nthe observation of Lamarck.\r\n\r\nBesides the name of Otaheitan Cowry, this shell has been also called the\r\n“Orange Cowry,” and the “Morning Dawn,” in reference to the latin\r\n“Cypræa Aurantium,” and “Aurora,” by both which it had been at different\r\ntimes distinguished. That of Aurantium alludes only to the prevailing\r\norange colour of the shell, and has been given to it by Gmelin after\r\nMartyn. There is something more poetically elegant, and perhaps no less\r\nappropriate in the trivial name Aurora, which Lamarck adopts: we may in\r\ntruth compare its beauteous fulvous hues fading into white with\r\ninexpressive softness, to the warm glowing tints and fainter blushes of\r\nan opening morning sky in summer. We have also adopted this name as well\r\nas Lamarck, for its peculiar elegance, in preference to that of\r\nAurantium.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the epithet “Aurora,” bestowed upon this shell has\r\nprobably long since been forgotten; it arose from one of those fugitive\r\nevents not likely to be recorded excepting only in the recollection of\r\ncollectors; and those in whose immediate knowledge the circumstance\r\noccurred have long since passed this transitory scene and are perhaps\r\nere this themselves forgotten. The relation though in some respects\r\ntrivial, may afford amusement to the amateur: it serves to shew the\r\norigin of its name “Aurora” at the same time that it presents a striking\r\nillustration of that ardent zeal with which the science of Conchology\r\nwas cultivated in this country nearly half a century ago; its\r\nauthenticity may be relied upon. The circumstance as related to us by an\r\nold collector some years ago was briefly this; a specimen of the shell\r\nhad very shortly after the return of the discovery ships been presented\r\nby one of the officers to a lady, which coming to the knowledge of a\r\nmost zealous collector of that period, he solicited the indulgence of\r\nseeing it; and waited upon the lady for the purpose, upon an intimation\r\nthat the favour would be readily granted. Madam, said the enraptured\r\nvisitor, gazing in admiration upon the Cowry, which he now beheld for\r\nthe first time, has this shell a price? will twenty guineas purchase\r\nthis lovely gem? it will not answered the lady. Allow me then said its\r\nenthusiastic admirer to clasp it for a moment in my hands, and bending\r\non one knee, at the same time pressing the shell to his lips, pronounced\r\nwith an emphasis of poetic fervour, “thus do I salute the ‘Morning Dawn’\r\nof the new discovered world!” Let poets reverence Venus the beauty of\r\nthe Grecian seas: my idol is “Aurora,” this sea-born nymph of surpassing\r\nbeauty, that rose upon the waves of the Southern deep!\r\n\r\n           Tu quoque cum Dea sis, Divâ formosior illâ\r\n           Concha per æquoreum quam vasa ducit iter.[25]\r\n\r\n                                           _Sec. 6. Basium._\r\n\r\nAbating somewhat of the romantic warmth with which the ideas of the\r\nvenerable collector alluded to was expressed, it must be admitted that\r\nin point of beautiful simplicity this shell has never been surpassed by\r\nany subsequent discoveries in the southern hemisphere; and it is no less\r\nsingular than certain that the price of twenty guineas, which that\r\ncollector named upon an imaginary valuation, has become the average\r\nstandard value of a fine shell of this kind for some years past. At\r\npresent they are more highly prized, because it is now pretty clearly\r\nascertained that they are no longer to be procured among the natives of\r\nOtaheite; and for this reason it is much more likely they will reach a\r\nstill higher price than that the value of them should diminish. The\r\nshell we have represented is to be considered as a very fine specimen in\r\nrespect to size as well as colour.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  We learn from Labillardière, one of the Naturalists attached to the\r\n  expedition of Admiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux, who went in search of La\r\n  Perouse in 1791, 1792, 1793, that this report is true. When the French\r\n  ships _Recherche_ and _Espérance_ touched at Tongataboo, there\r\n  happened to be peace between them and Fidgi, and as usual when they\r\n  are not at war, a considerable commerce was at that time carried on\r\n  between them. This brought Vouacecee, one of the chiefs of Fidgi, to\r\n  Tongataboo soon after the French had cast anchor, and as he paid them\r\n  frequently a visit, they were able to collect from him some useful\r\n  information. Vouacecee represented Fidgi to be very high land, of\r\n  great fertility and lying distant in the north west direction about\r\n  seventy-two _myriametres_. The myriametre reduced to our standard is\r\n  six miles, one furlong, one hundred and fifty-six yards, and six\r\n  inches, giving in total value about one hundred and forty-nine\r\n  leagues, or four hundred and forty-seven miles. In the most favourable\r\n  weather with the large double canoe the voyage to Fidgi from thence\r\n  could not be less than three days, and when they had to struggle\r\n  against the south winds they must ply to windward upwards of a month.\r\n  The people of Tongataboo told them the people of Fidgi were cannibals:\r\n  Vouacecee strove to exculpate himself by answering that it was only\r\n  the _touas_, or people of the lowest class, who eat human flesh. But\r\n  the assurances of the natives of Tongataboo were fully confirmed in\r\n  other quarters, and Labillardière who observes they devour their\r\n  enemies to satiate their fury, is entirely satisfied the chiefs as\r\n  well as touas are _Anthrophagi_. These people, notwithstanding this\r\n  atrocity, are represented as being far more advanced in arts and\r\n  industry than the people of other islands, who receive from them in\r\n  time of peace many articles of ingenious workmanship and produce of\r\n  their island, and it is, no doubt, by this means that the _Orange\r\n  Cowry_ has been introduced among the natives of Otaheite and other\r\n  islands in those seas.\r\n\r\n  Besides its being satisfactory to ascertain beyond any doubt the\r\n  habitat of the Orange Cowry, the Conchologist is assured that other\r\n  shells of the most choice and valuable kinds inhabit the seas of this\r\n  island, for which reason it is presumed the above information may not\r\n  prove altogether unimportant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  We should not omit to mention that this shell was called _Aurora_ by\r\n  Dr. Solander about the same time, _Vide_ his MS. Whether he was\r\n  indebted to this circumstance for the hint of so naming it, or on the\r\n  contrary that the gentleman was aware of the name which Dr. Solander\r\n  intended for it, is now beyond our means of ascertaining. It is more\r\n  obvious that Chemnitz, and after him Lamarck, have received the name\r\n  Aurora from one or both of these sources, although the anecdote may be\r\n  itself forgotten.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _33_\r\n\r\n  _London.

The prevailing colour of the plumage green, front and crown of\r\nthe head blueish green, the rest of the head and neck black: the\r\nfeathers upon the face glossed with blue: a large ovate cinereous spot\r\non the cheeks: throat and breast black varied with pale yellowish\r\nscollops, the margin of the feathers being a pale sulphureous yellow,\r\nthe disk black: the black disk usually forming a kind of triangular spot\r\nwith the point tending downwards. The wings are green, except the quill\r\nfeathers, which are blue, and the butt of the wing or shoulder the\r\ncolour of which is scarlet. The body beneath green with a large spot of\r\nsanguineous-purple on the abdomen. The lower part of the back and rump\r\nthe same sanguineous purple colour as the abdominal spot: tail above\r\ngreen, the feathers purplish towards the end; beneath rufous brown.\r\n\r\nThis curious bird is nearly allied to _Psittacus Squammosus_, the _Scaly\r\nBreasted Parrakeet_, and in no very remote degree with another kind of\r\nParrakeet, the _Wavy Breasted Parrot_, _Psittacus Lineatus_. The first\r\nof these our bird exceeds by at least an inch in length, the other by an\r\ninch and a quarter. Instead of the dark colours of the head, as in our\r\nbird, the head and neck of P. Squammosus are dull orange. The darker\r\ncolouring of our bird assimilates more nearly with _Psittacus Lineatus_,\r\nbut in other respects is entirely different.

From this little\r\nstore the species passed in the first instance into several collections,\r\nand among others into that of the late Duchess of Portland, Dr.\r\nChauncey, Mr. Cracherode, Mr. G. Humphrey, and some others. It has since\r\noccurred, but not in any abundance to later voyagers in those seas. And\r\nit is reputed also to have been met with in the Straits of Magellan.\r\n\r\nThe specimen of this rare shell which we have delineated, and which\r\nalways was considered as one of the largest of its species known, once\r\nconstituted part of the Testaceological collection of Sir Ashton Lever,\r\nhaving been presented to that eminent collector by Captain Cook, at the\r\ntime of his return to England after his first voyage. There is a small\r\nhole pierced through the upper valve of this shell, and which, in the\r\nabsence of all other information, induces the persuasion of its having\r\nbeen originally suspended like several other shells we have already\r\nmentioned, as an ornament or appendage to the dress of some New\r\nZealander; the aperture being so designed that the two valves could\r\neasily have been kept together by means of a string passing through this\r\nhole of the upper valve, and the opening in the beak of the lower one.\r\nThe animal inhabitant is probably eaten by the New Zealanders, who\r\nbesides being cannibals, subsist chiefly upon the marine productions of\r\ntheir shores, which their wives and female children obtain daily for\r\nthem by swimming and diving into the sea. There is a rare species found\r\nin the Mediterranean Sea, Anomia Vitrea of Gmelin, which nearly\r\napproaches this species in point of size, and is eagerly sought after,\r\nwe are told, by the people of those parts as a delicious food. We\r\nshould, however, imagine from its scarcity, that it is only at the\r\ntables of the rich that this luxurious repast appears.\r\n\r\nIn adopting the genus Terebratula for the shell before us, some\r\nexplanation may be expected for our departure from the Linnæan\r\nclassification, for in the system of that author it is one of the Anomia\r\nTribe, the term and character of Terebratula not being recognised by\r\nthat author as generically distinct from the Anomia. Our reasons for\r\nthis deviation shall be explained as briefly as it is possible: from the\r\nnature of those remarks, and the extent of enquiry with which it is\r\nconnected, this cannot however be comprised within very slender limits.\r\n\r\nIn the Linnæan arrangement, the Anomia form a very comprehensive genus,\r\nand since in particular the fossil species are included it should\r\ncertainly have been divided into several distinct sections or families\r\nin order to embrace the different tribes of those shells, which\r\naccording to the character Linnæus has given of the genus must\r\nnecessarily be referred to it. It is impossible without some\r\nmodification of this kind to reconcile _Anomia Ephippium and Cepa_, with\r\n_Anomia Caput Serpentinus_ or _Terebratula_, or either of them with _A.\r\nPlacenta_; and there are besides these some other families which do not\r\nwell accord, and which might perhaps be separated into distinct genera\r\nwith great advantage, the fossil kinds especially, which are very\r\nnumerous and much diversified in structure. It cannot be very material\r\nwhether they be so divided into genera or be placed in different\r\nfamilies under the general appellation of Anomiæ: they are obviously\r\nvery dissimilar and should be kept apart, and we have examples of both\r\nthese modes of classing the Anomiæ among the early Naturalists.\r\n\r\nA late french writer, M. Bosc, speaking of this tribe of shells,\r\nobserves, that Linnæus having confounded the _Terebratules_ with the\r\n_Anomies_, Bruguière first established their differences, and Lamarck\r\nhad fixed their characters. This observation is not sufficiently\r\nexplicit, and may possibly imply more than the author of it has\r\nintended. It assumes as a conclusion that Linnæus committed an error in\r\nconfounding these two genera, without informing us in what state of\r\narrangement Linnæus found them. It may be inferred from this that they\r\nhad been more accurately discriminated before his time, or on the\r\ncontrary, that they never had been classed in any form, and that it was\r\nthe want of knowledge in Linnæus which led him to confound shells\r\ntogether that were generically distinct. But whichever we are to\r\nunderstand, the conclusion is, that Linnæus had confounded them, and\r\nthat it remained for Bruguière and Lamarck to reform those errors of\r\nLinnæus, which all later Naturalists had left uncorrected, if not\r\nunobserved. Now really this view of the subject is not fairly taken if\r\nsuch an inference be intended. The result of a very little enquiry among\r\nthe authors who preceded Linnæus, or were immediately subsequent to him,\r\nwill assure us of the truth of this; and will convince us beyond a\r\ndoubt, that the discrimination of neither of those authors was necessary\r\neither to furnish the Naturalists of the present day with the term\r\nTerebratula; to determine the differences that exist between them and\r\nthe Anomiæ, or to fix the characters by which the Terebratulæ are\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe Anomia genus, instead of being devised by Linnæus, or Terebratula in\r\nparticular, owing its invention to any modern writer, have been both so\r\nlong established that the greatest difficulty is to determine where in\r\nthe retrospect of authors our enquiries are to cease. Without proceeding\r\nfurther back than the last two centuries, it may be observed that\r\n_Fabius Columna_ in his work “De Purpura,” published at Rome in the year\r\n1616, speaks of the Anomiæ; he calls them _Conchæ rariores Anomiæ_, and\r\nfrom that period at least the term Anomia has been received among\r\nNaturalists. Nor is the term Terebratula of much later origin. Da Costa\r\nin his Elements of Conchology informs us that from the time of Fabius\r\nColumna the word Anomia had become universal, that is as a general\r\ndenomination for all the shells which Linnæus subsequently placed\r\ntogether under that name. The term Terebratula was given, says this\r\nwriter, by Gualtieri; in plate 96 of his work, Gualtieri figures three\r\nrecent kinds, and has made a particular genus for them, which he calls\r\nTerebratula. And it is further added in another place “the Anomiæ are\r\nbivalves with unequal valves, and never eared, the beak of the largest\r\nor under valve is greatly produced, and rises or curves over the beak of\r\nthe smaller or upper valve, and is perforated or pierced through like a\r\ntube, from which particular they have also obtained the name of\r\n_Terebratulæ_.”\r\n\r\nThese remarks sufficiently establish the circumstance of the term\r\nAnomia, being a comprehensive title for all the shells which Linnæus\r\nsubsequently placed together under that name, and also shews that we are\r\nnot indebted to either Bruguière or Lamarck for discriminating the\r\nTerebratulæ. We can ever go further back in this particular than Da\r\nCosta has done, for that able author is mistaken in supposing Gualtieri\r\nto be the first writer who had proposed the genus Terebratula. Gualtieri\r\npublished his work in the year 1724, and we happen to possess among\r\nother valuable MSS. of the celebrated Antiquarian, Hearne, the original\r\ncopy of Lluid’s Lithophylacia Britannica, as corrected for the press,\r\ndated Montgomery, 1698, in which the genus Terebratula is distinctly\r\nnamed: and this, as it appears from the date, was more than fifty years\r\nbefore the time of Gualtieri; and we have also the authority of our\r\nenglish Lister in 1694 for the like distinction. All these writers, it\r\nwill be observed, preceded Klein, who has in a particular manner\r\ndescribed the genus Terebratula in his Methodus Ostraceologia, published\r\nin 1753, but in which he does not speak of himself as having invented\r\nthat term. “TEREBRATULAS, _Luidiano_ titulo, vocamus DIACONCHAS\r\nanomalas, rostro parterebrato, vid. _Nomencl. Litholog. Promotum_ hoc\r\ntitulo.” His genus _Concha_ ΤΡΊΛΟΒΟΣ, genus _Concha_ ADUNCA, genus\r\nBURSULA, and genus GLOBUS, are all sub-divisions of the _Anomiæ Conchæ_\r\nof other writers, divided according to their forms and other\r\npeculiarities, and in which particular attention is paid to the\r\nperforation or non-perforation of the beak; Trilobos being distinguished\r\nas “_vertice integro_,” Bursula as _Terebratulæformes_ rostro non\r\nperforato, &c. And we may lastly mention that from some original MSS. of\r\nDa Costa, in our possession, it appears that Anomia was a general term\r\nfor the whole family, and _Terebratula Anomiæ lævis_ was the term by\r\nwhich the English and other Naturalists, long prior to the middle of\r\nlast century, were accustomed to distinguish the same kind of shells\r\nwhich in the modern nomenclature of Conchology is also named generically\r\nTerebratula. Da Costa, as Librarian of the Royal Society, was in the\r\nhabit of correspondence with the learned men of his time throughout\r\nEurope, and his local knowledge from this circumstance, though never\r\ncommitted to the press, is not likely to be disputed.\r\n\r\nWe could proceed yet further, but enough has surely been advanced to\r\nshew that so far from Linnæus having confounded the Terebratula with the\r\nAnomia, he left them precisely as he found them, placing them after the\r\nexample of his predecessors, under the comprehensive term of Anomia,\r\nwhich they had assigned to them. And we have also said enough to prove\r\nthat to ascribe the Genus Terebratula to either Bruguière or Lamarck can\r\nresult only from our ignorance of that information which in former days\r\nwas regarded as the best criterion of an able Naturalist, a correct\r\nknowledge of the labours of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nUnder all its circumstances it may be a matter of some indifference to\r\nthe scientific Naturalist whether in the arrangement of the Anomiæ we\r\nfollow the concise method of the old writers and Linnæus among the\r\nnumber, or the diffuse distribution of later writers. If we place them\r\nin different families according to their characters, whether regarded as\r\nsectional distinctions of Anomia, or as distinct genera, we shall at\r\nleast produce some consistency in the arrangement. But there is yet\r\nanother mode of arrangement which appears to be the favourite theme with\r\nsome Conchologists of the present day, and which it may be proper in\r\nthis place to mention, namely, the classification of shells according to\r\ntheir animals. This has been attempted in the work of Cuvier, his “Règne\r\nAnimal,” and the result of this endeavour, so far as it relates to the\r\nAnomia in particular, may in this place deserve our explicit\r\nobservation. In this work (_Règne Animal_) Cuvier endeavouring to class\r\nthe Anomiæ according to the animals known to inhabit them, as well as\r\nthose which he imagines for the fossil tribes, so disperses them, that\r\nthe Trochi, Turbines, Nautili, Volutæ, and indeed nearly the whole of\r\nthe _Univalves_ intervene between his two first genera of these\r\n_bivalves_, Hyalæa and Anomia; and the Anomia tridentata of Forskahl,\r\nwhich is the Hyalæa of this author, is placed with Clio (the shell of\r\nwhich is our _Bulla Aperta_[26]) among the _Ptéropodes_. After the long\r\ninterval occasioned by this introduction of the Univalves we find\r\nAnomia,[26] and Placuna, two of his genera together, but with another\r\ntribe of beings, the animal inhabitants being of his class _Acéphales_;\r\nand after another wide interval in which the bivalve Mya,[26] the\r\nmultivalve Pholas,[26] the univalve Teredo,[26] and the naked or\r\nshell-less Ascidia, occur we find in a distant class among another tribe\r\nof animals, _Mollusques Brachopodes_, the genus _Terebratula_. It is\r\nhere ascribed to Bruguière, as in other works it is assigned to Lamarck.\r\nSuch is the arrangement of this family in the _Règne Animal_ of Cuvier,\r\na form in which no cabinet, it must be acknowledged, could be arranged\r\nwithout embracing the most unprecedented anomalies; nor can we doubt\r\nthat if the animals of the fossil Terebratulæ and Anomiæ were known, for\r\nin this arrangement they rest on presumption only, they must be further\r\nseparated in such a system than they are at present, some being\r\nperforated at the beaks, others imperforate, and some having the\r\naperture under the beaks, all which demonstrates a difference in the\r\nstructure of the animal, to whose use they were adapted.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis of the generical distinctions of the different\r\nfamilies of the Anomiæ we may now be permitted to return to the shell\r\nbefore us, the object of our more immediate consideration, and\r\nrespecting which there appears to be no less misconception among late\r\nlater writers than we have found already respecting the genera.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Dr. Leach had some short time since published a figure\r\nof this shell: his definition is altogether brief, and the information\r\nhe affords less explanatory than might be desired: he quotes no\r\nauthority or synonyms, and in his general description merely observes\r\nthat “It seems to be a very rare species, a few specimens only having\r\nbeen received from New Zealand.” _Vide. Zool. Misc. p. 76._ Lamarck\r\nassuming from these observations, as it may be presumed, that the shell\r\nhad not been previously noticed, unless it were an Anomia Capensis of\r\nGmelin, proposes it as a new species under the name of Terebratula\r\nSanguinea of Leach, at the same time that he rejects his specific\r\ncharacter, and assigns another to the species; the character given to it\r\nas a new species by Dr. Leach is “_Testa sanguinea, subtillissime et\r\ncreberrime impresso-punctata, longitudinaliter costata, costis\r\nsimplicibus; antica uniundulata_;” that of Lamarck, “_Testâ oblongâ,\r\nirregulari, rubrá, creberrimé impresso punctata; striis transversis\r\nundulatîs; margine denticulato_,” to which is added, “_Habite—les mers\r\nde la Nouvelle Zélande d’après M. Leach_.” This seems to shew that the\r\nshell was only known to Lamarck, through the communication of the\r\nlast-mentioned writer; and the suggestion is the more probable since the\r\nspecimen in the British Museum has the same interrogation as to being\r\nthe Anomia Capensis of Chemnitz, that is annexed by Lamarck to his\r\ndescription of the species. “Je crois qu’on doit donner comme synonyme\r\nl’Anomia capensis Gmel., d’après la citation de Chemniz; mais l’individu\r\nque j’avais sous les yeux, n’est pas assez entier pour affirmer ce\r\nrapprochement.”\r\n\r\nThere is obviously some want of farther explanation in these details,\r\nthe omission of which may possibly be supplied by tracing the history of\r\nthis interesting shell from the time in which it first appeared in this\r\ncountry; for there are local circumstances connected with it which\r\nhaving escaped the mention of Dr. Leach, and consequently of Lamarck,\r\nhave led to the erroneous conclusion that it had remained till very\r\nlately undescribed. Dr. Leach was probably not aware, or through some\r\noversight omits to notice that the specific name which he has given to\r\nthis shell was that assigned to it many years ago by Dr. Solander, and\r\nthat it has uniformly borne the name of _Anomia sanguinea_, or\r\n(_Terebratula sanguinea_) among all the English Naturalists in\r\nconsequence from the time of that learned friend and companion of Sir\r\nJoseph Banks down to the present period: It is the Anomia sanguinea of\r\nDr. Solanders MSS. and was designated under that name in the Museum of\r\nthe Dutchess of Portland: it appeared under the same appellation in the\r\ncatalogue of that museum, published in 1786: in the Calonnian Museum and\r\nCatalogue, printed in the year 1795; it stood under that name also in\r\nthe Museum of Sir Ashton Lever, and it appeared under the same\r\ndenomination in the sale catalogue of that museum, published in the year\r\n1806. Under all these circumstances it may be presumed the name must\r\nhave obtained no small publicity, and we need scarcely add that the\r\nexample of these authorities were followed in the Cabinets of english\r\ncollectors generally, that happened to be in possession of the shell,\r\namong which was that of Mr. Cracherode, which was subsequently deposited\r\nin the British Museum. And lastly, it should be mentioned that it occurs\r\nunder the same name in the Testaceological Manual of Mr. Dillwyn.\r\nNothing therefore can be more certain than that the french writers are\r\nnot correct in their opinion when they imagine that the shell had been\r\nso named in the first instance by Dr. Leach; and it is no less certain\r\nthat the credit of having first noticed the species is due to Dr.\r\nSolander, he described it more than forty years ago: his words as they\r\nstand in his manuscripts are, “ANOMIA SANGUINEA _obovato,\r\nlongitudinaliter sulcata, triloba; sinu profundo nate producta latere\r\nangulata foramen ambiente_.” Mr. Dillwyn has well expressed the\r\ncharacter of this shell in his description of Anomia Sanguinea, but has\r\nby some oversight misquoted this passage of Dr. Solander’s manuscripts;\r\nand by that means has confounded the _Anomia Sanguinea_ of Dr. Solander,\r\nwith his Anomia Cruenta; this will be more fully shewn hereafter.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject we have only lastly to observe that although Lamarck\r\nhas deemed it requisite to give a specific character of this shell\r\ndissimilar from that of Dr. Leach, he omits to mention, as well as the\r\nformer, that very conspicuous character of the species, the deep\r\nlongitudinal hollow down the middle of the upper valve, and the dorsal\r\nelevation of the lower one. Lamarck, indeed, confesses that the\r\nindividual which he had under his eyes, and consequently that which he\r\ndescribes, is not sufficiently perfect to authorize him in determining\r\nthe analogy between that shell and the Anomia Capensis of Gmelin, which\r\nChemnitz has figured; a circumstance that may explain the cause of this\r\nomission in the specific character of Terebratula sanguinea. Yet we\r\nshould have thought a shell sufficiently entire to have enabled this\r\ningenious Naturalist to have composed his character of the species,\r\nwould have been so far perfect as to have justified some conclusion upon\r\nits analogy with the Gmelinian Anomia Capensis. We may confidently add\r\nthat these two shells are totally distinct species, and are even\r\ngenerically different if we enter very scrupulously upon their\r\ndistinctive characters. Dr. Solander had described this latter shell\r\nbefore the time of Gmelin under the name of Anomia Cruenta.\r\n\r\nThe representations of this choice testaceous production, which\r\naccompanies our present description, will, it is presumed, convey a more\r\ncorrect idea of the shell than can be expressed by words. The Leverian\r\nspecimen from which, as before observed, these figures are taken,\r\nrealized at the public hammer at the Leverian sale the sum of five\r\nguineas,[27] and it still remains so rare that there would probably be\r\nlittle, if any, dimunition in the price were it again to be disposed of\r\nin the same manner at the present period. The shells of this kind vary\r\nin some small degree in the intensity of colour from a very deep\r\nsanguineous red to a paler hue.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  Many of these are found on our own coasts. _Vide Donovan’s British\r\n  Shells_, in which the figures and descriptions of a number of the\r\n  species of these genera occur.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Last Day’s Sale, lot 74, £5 5s.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _35_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Belladonna_.\r\n\r\nFabricius, as it appears from his references in his Entomologia\r\nSystematica, met with the drawings of this species in the collection of\r\nMr. Jones, whose cabinet also possessed the original specimen from which\r\nthe drawing was taken. It is from this individual example in the cabinet\r\nof Mr. Jones that the delineation in the annexed plate is copied.\r\n\r\nThis curious Papilio is one of the larger species of the Heliconi tribe\r\nto which it appertains. The wings are a blueish black, and rather\r\nclosely studded with sub-hyaline or transparent spots, which are\r\nminutely speckled with black: those on the anterior wings are somewhat\r\nsagittate and disposed into two irregular bands towards the exterior\r\nhalf of the wings: those on the posterior wings are rather larger and\r\nmore inclining to an ovate form; and three of the largest, namely, one\r\nat the base, and two at the anal angle, are of a bright yellow colour.\r\nThe inner limb of the wing is grey inclining to yellowish. The head and\r\nthorax are black; the abdomen black with the sides pale yellow. The\r\nspots being semitransparent the appearance on the underside in a great\r\ndegree corresponds with that above: there is a small difference, because\r\ninstead of one yellowish spot at the base of the posterior wing, there\r\nare two, another smaller than that which appears at the base of that\r\nwing on the upper surface being situated below it. We have been more\r\nminute in the description of these spots, because upon an attentive\r\ncomparison of the insect in Mr. Jones’s Cabinet, with the Fabrician\r\ndescription, we perceive some small deficiency in the latter, a\r\ncircumstance, it must be confessed, of rare occurrence in this author,\r\nbut unquestionably worthy of our notice and correction, as it is the\r\nonly authority upon which the species must in future rest.\r\n\r\nThe country of this interesting insect is unknown; it is remotely\r\nconjectured only that it may be Africa. The insect is represented with\r\nits wings expanded upon a sprig of\r\n\r\n                           ERICA PARMENTARIA,\r\n\r\nan elegant vegetable production of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _36_\r\n\r\n  _London.

Cuvier mentions as a character of this\r\ntribe that their breathing apertures, with the exception of a family he\r\ncalls Cyclostomes, are composed of a number of foliations ranged\r\nparallel to each other like the teeth of a comb. They have two feelers,\r\nand two eyes usually situated on a pedicle. The greatest difference\r\nbetween these animals consist in the presence or absence of the canal\r\nformed by a prolongation of the edge of the pulmonary cavity of the left\r\nside, a respiratory organ communicating with others by means of which\r\nthe animal breathes without quitting its retreat in the water.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lamarck the animal of Nerita has the foot large and short,\r\nwith two pointed feelers, and the eyes raised upon a papilla at the\r\nexterior base of each.\r\n\r\nBosc is less diffuse than either. The animal of the Nerites, he\r\nobserves, have the head flat and lunate, a little sloping to the two\r\nextremities: from the base of the head on each side issues two conic\r\nslender horns, one of which is twice the length of the other. The eyes\r\nare two little black points placed upon a trihedral tubercule at the\r\nexterior base of the horns, the mouth placed underneath the head and\r\nformed with a lip, thick and wrinkled. The foot almost round, flat\r\nbeneath, convex above, and rather shorter than the shell. The mantle or\r\nfleshy prolongation entirely covers the interior of the shell and is\r\nslightly crenulated at the margin.\r\n\r\nDenys de Montfort speaking of the species Nerita Peloronata, a shell\r\nabounding on the shores of the Antilles, observes that there are male\r\nand female animals of this kind, the two sexes being isolated or\r\ndistinct individuals; they are of an amphibious nature, living in the\r\nsea, from whence they ascend occasionally and crawl about the rocks.\r\n\r\nLinnæus under the Nerita genus comprehends as well the imperforated or\r\nnon-umbilicated kinds as those which have that perforation. The later\r\ncontinental writers divide these again, retaining the name Nerita to\r\nthose which have no perforation; those with a perforation are called\r\nNatica, by the french authors Natice, after Adanson, Gualtieri, and\r\nFavanne. Lamarck has also a genus Neritina, and another Navicella, all\r\nwhich in the Linnæan system are of the Nerita tribe.\r\n\r\nNerita Polita is by no means an uncommon shell upon the coasts of the\r\nIndian Ocean, being found throughout their whole extent from Japan to\r\nthe Cape of Good of Hope, and as it appears also upon the shores of many\r\nislands in the Indian and the Great Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nBesides being so very abundant in those parts, it may also be observed\r\nthat no species of the testaceous tribe is more remarkable for the\r\nalmost endless variety of colours, or the form and disposition of the\r\nspots, dots, and lineations, than the individuals of this kind of Nerit.\r\nThere are, however, some few of its varieties which from being local are\r\nfar less abundant than the rest, and the shell in particular which we\r\nhave selected for the most conspicuous object in the annexed plate is\r\none the most important of the number. The prevailing colour of the\r\nordinary varieties is olivaceous, in some paler, in others more\r\ninclining to blackish; the charactered marks in general yellowish,\r\ntriangular or sagittate, and varied with short blackish lines. This is\r\nthe usual appearance of the back or upper part of the shell, the region\r\nsurrounding the mouth is white, including the lip, the inside of the\r\nmouth yellow, and this latter character appears constant throughout all\r\nthe varieties of the species. The particular variety which constitutes\r\nthe chief object in our plate, is of the red banded kind, the bands\r\nbeing diversified with red and white, disposed in spots, and lineations,\r\nwith peculiar elegance. The varieties of this banded kind are scarce in\r\ngeneral, but the particular kind which we have represented is unique,\r\nwhether regarded for its magnitude, its exquisite perfection, or\r\nbrilliancy of colouring. We have represented the upper and under surface\r\nof this shell, together with the upper and under surface of a shell of\r\nthe common kind, in order that by the contrast, the beauty of the former\r\nmight be exemplified with greater perspicuity.\r\n\r\nThe history of this matchless variety of Nerita Polita is distinctly\r\nknown: it is one of those shells which were brought from the Sandwich\r\nIslands by Captain Cook, when he returned from his first voyage of\r\ndiscovery in the South Seas. It was observed appended to an ornament\r\nworn at the breast of one of the natives, and was obtained in exchange,\r\nit is believed, for an iron hatchet; the Islander to whom it belonged\r\nesteeming it very much, and the English Officer being anxious to possess\r\nit. This circumstance of its having been affixed to an ornament worn by\r\none of the savages, explains the reason of the shell being perforated,\r\nthe hole having been made in order to pass a string through the shell to\r\nfasten it on the ornament securely. The shell was presented by Captain\r\nCook to Sir Ashton Lever, in whose Museum it was subsequently deposited;\r\nand notwithstanding the defect above-mentioned, this little shell\r\nproduced at the dissolution of the Leverian Museum, in the year 1806,\r\nthe sum of nine pounds sterling, at the public hammer.[29] A celebrated\r\ncollector, the late Mr. Noel Jennings, was the purchaser; and it is\r\nunderstood that on the subsequent dispersion of the collection of Mr.\r\nJennings, which took place a few years ago, that it became, with some\r\nother very rare shells of that collection, the property of Lord Mount\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  Linnæus describes the animal of the Nerita as a limax, the body of\r\n  which is oblong, with a fleshy shield above, and a longitudinal flat\r\n  disk beneath: aperture on the right side within the shield: feelers,\r\n  four, placed above the mouth: eyes, two, and situated one at the tip\r\n  of each of the larger feelers. This character does not exactly accord\r\n  with the animal of the Nerita, for in this tribe, instead of the eyes\r\n  being situated upon the apex of the longer feelers, they stand each\r\n  upon a kind of papilla, situated at the outer base of the longer\r\n  feelers. And besides this, it differs in some less material\r\n  peculiarities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Fifty-Eight Day (last day but two) lot 87, “_A most beautiful variety\r\n  of the Painted Nerita, having three rich pink bands on a dark clouded\r\n  ground taken from an ornament worn by a native of one of the Sandwich\r\n  Islands._”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             END OF VOL.
