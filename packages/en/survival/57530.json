Volcanism has built some of the world’s greatest mountain\r\nranges, covered vast regions with _lava_ (molten rock at the Earth’s\r\nsurface), and triggered explosive eruptions whose size and power are\r\nnearly impossible for us to imagine today. Fortunately, such calamitous\r\neruptions occur infrequently. Of the 50 or so volcanoes that erupt every\r\nyear, however, a few severely disrupt human activities. Between 1980 and\r\n1990, volcanic activity killed at least 26,000 people and forced nearly\r\n450,000 to flee from their homes.\r\n\r\nThough few people in the United States may actually experience an\r\nerupting volcano, the evidence for earlier volcanism is preserved in\r\nmany rocks of North America. Features seen in volcanic rocks only hours\r\nold are also present in ancient volcanic rocks, both at the surface and\r\nburied beneath younger deposits. A thick ash deposit sandwiched between\r\nlayers of sandstone in Nebraska, the massive granite peaks of the Sierra\r\nNevada mountain range, and a variety of volcanic layers found in eastern\r\nMaine are but a few of the striking clues of past volcanism. With this\r\nperspective, an erupting volcano is not only an exciting and awesome\r\nspectacle in its own right but a window into a natural process that has\r\nhappened over and over again throughout Earth’s history.\r\n\r\nThe Earth’s crust, on which we live and depend, is in large part the\r\nproduct of millions of once-active volcanoes and tremendous volumes of\r\n_magma_ (molten rock below ground) that did not erupt but instead cooled\r\nbelow the surface. Such persistent and widespread volcanism has resulted\r\nin many valuable natural resources throughout the world. For example,\r\nvolcanic ash blown over thousands of square kilometers of land increases\r\nsoil fertility for forests and agriculture by adding nutrients and\r\nacting as a mulch. Groundwater heated by large, still-hot magma bodies\r\ncan be tapped for geothermal energy. And over many thousands of years,\r\nheated groundwater has concentrated valuable minerals, including copper,\r\ntin, gold, and silver, into deposits that are mined throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe United States ranks third, behind Indonesia and Japan, in the number\r\nof historically active volcanoes (that is, those for which we have\r\nwritten accounts of eruptions). In addition, about 10 percent of the\r\nmore than 1,500 volcanoes that have erupted in the past 10,000 years are\r\nlocated in the United States. Most of these volcanoes are found in the\r\nAleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, the Hawaiian Islands, and the\r\nCascade Range of the Pacific Northwest; the remainder are widely\r\ndistributed in the western part of the Nation. A few U.S. volcanoes have\r\nproduced some of the largest and most dangerous types of eruptions in\r\nthis century, while several others have threatened to erupt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of United States showing areas where active volcanoes\r\nare located and shown later in more detail.]\r\n\r\n  ALASKA See page 24\r\n  UNITED STATES See page 16\r\n  HAWAIIAN ISLANDS See page 10\r\n\r\nScientists at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) engage in a variety of\r\nresearch activities in order to reduce the loss of life and property\r\nthat can result from volcanic eruptions and to minimize the social and\r\neconomic turmoil that can result when volcanoes threaten to erupt. These\r\nactivities include studies of the physical processes before, during, and\r\nafter a volcanic eruption, assessments of volcano hazards, and public\r\noutreach to translate scientific information about volcanoes into terms\r\nthat are meaningful to the public and public officials.\r\n\r\nMonitoring volcanoes for signs of activity, another vital component, is\r\ncarried out by USGS earth scientists at three volcano observatories,\r\nwhich were established to study active volcanoes in Hawaii (1912), the\r\nCascades (1980), and Alaska (1988). These researchers record\r\nearthquakes, survey the surfaces of volcanoes, map volcanic rock\r\ndeposits, and analyze the chemistry of volcanic gas and fresh lava to\r\ndetect warning signs of impending activity and determine the most likely\r\ntype of activity that will affect areas around a volcano. During the\r\npast 10 years, several warnings of eruptions were issued by the USGS and\r\nmonitoring of recently active volcanoes in the United States was\r\nexpanded. Predicting the time and size of volcanic eruptions, however,\r\nremains a difficult challenge for scientists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scientist collects lava sample from lava flow entering\r\nthe sea on Kilauea Volcano.

Most\r\nare concentrated on the edges of continents, along island chains, or\r\nbeneath the sea forming long mountain ranges. More than half of the\r\nworld’s active volcanoes above sea level encircle the Pacific Ocean to\r\nform the circum-Pacific “Ring of Fire.” In the past 25 years, scientists\r\nhave developed a theory—called plate tectonics—that explains the\r\nlocations of volcanoes and their relationship to other large-scale\r\ngeologic features.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, the Earth’s surface is made up of a patchwork\r\nof about a dozen large plates that move relative to one another at\r\nspeeds from less than one centimeter to about ten centimeters per year\r\n(about the speed at which fingernails grow). These rigid plates, whose\r\naverage thickness is about 80 kilometers, are spreading apart, sliding\r\npast each other, or colliding with each other in slow motion on top of\r\nthe Earth’s hot, pliable interior. Volcanoes tend to form where plates\r\ncollide or spread apart, but they can also grow in the middle of a\r\nplate, as for example the Hawaiian volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The boundary between the Pacific and Juan de Fuca Plates\r\nis marked by a broad submarine mountain chain about 500 km long, known\r\nas the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Young volcanoes, lava flows, and hot springs\r\nwere discovered in a broad valley less than 8 km wide along the crest of\r\nthe ridge in the 1970’s. The ocean floor is spreading apart and forming\r\nnew ocean crust along this valley or “rift” as hot magma from the\r\nEarth’s interior is injected into the ridge and erupted at its top.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the\r\nNorth American Plate. As the denser plate of oceanic crust is forced\r\ndeep into the Earth’s interior beneath the continental plate, a process\r\nknown as subduction, it encounters high temperatures and pressures that\r\npartially melt solid rock. Some of this newly formed magma rises toward\r\nthe Earth’s surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes above the\r\nsubduction zone.]\r\n\r\n  PACIFIC PLATE\r\n    Juan de Fuca Ridge\r\n  JUAN DE FUCA PLATE\r\n  NORTH AMERICAN PLATE\r\n    Mt.

Formed initially above a\r\nrelatively stationary “hot spot” in the Earth’s interior, each volcano\r\nwas rafted away from the hot spot as the Pacific Plate moves\r\nnorthwestward at about 9 cm per year.

Kilauea’s eruptions are so intensely monitored that\r\nscientists have assembled a detailed picture of the volcano’s magma\r\nreservoir “plumbing” system and how it behaves before and during\r\neruptions. Studies of these volcanoes and the surrounding ocean floor\r\ncontinue to improve our understanding of the geologic history of the\r\nHawaiian Island chain and the ability of scientists to determine\r\nvolcanic hazards that threaten island residents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hawaiian Volcanoes]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    Volcano active during past 2,000 years\r\n    Potentially active volcano\r\n  Population centers\r\n    · 50,000 to 100,000\r\n    • 350,000 to 1,000,000\r\n  _PACIFIC OCEAN_\r\n  NIIHAU\r\n  KAUAI\r\n  OAHU\r\n    •Honolulu\r\n  MOLOKAI\r\n  MAUI\r\n    Haleakala\r\n  LANAI\r\n  KAHOOLAWE\r\n  HAWAII\r\n    Kohala\r\n    Mauna Kea\r\n    ·Hilo\r\n    Hualalai\r\n    Mauna Loa\r\n    Kilauea\r\n    Lohi\r\n\r\nEruptions of Hawaiian volcanoes are typically non-explosive because of\r\nthe composition of the magma. Almost all of the magma erupted from\r\nHawaii’s volcanoes forms dark gray to black volcanic rock (called\r\n_basalt_), generally in the form of lava flows and, less commonly, as\r\nfragmented lava such as volcanic bombs, cinders, pumice, and ash. Basalt\r\nmagma is more fluid than the other types of magma (andesite, dacite, and\r\nrhyolite). Consequently, expanding volcanic gases can escape from basalt\r\nrelatively easily and can propel lava high into the air, forming\r\nbrilliant fountains sometimes called “curtains of fire.”\r\n\r\nLava, whether erupted in high fountains or quietly pouring out, collects\r\nto form flows that spread across the ground in thin broad sheets or in\r\nnarrow streams. The fluid nature of basalt magma allows it to travel\r\ngreat distances from the _vent_ (the place where lava breaks ground) and\r\ntends to build volcanoes in the shape of an inverted warrior shield,\r\nwith slopes less than about 10 degrees. Volcanoes with this kind of\r\nprofile are called _shield volcanoes_.\r\n\r\nHawaiian volcanoes erupt at their summit calderas and from their flanks\r\nalong linear rift zones that extend from the calderas. _Calderas_ are\r\nlarge steep-walled depressions that form when a volcano’s summit region\r\ncollapses, usually after a large eruption empties or partly empties a\r\nreservoir of magma beneath the volcano. _Rift zones_ are areas of\r\nweakness within a volcano that extend from the surface to depths of\r\nseveral kilometers. Magma that erupts from the flank of a volcano must\r\nfirst flow underground through one of the volcano’s rift zones,\r\nsometimes traveling more than 30 kilometers from the summit magma\r\nreservoir before breaking the surface.\r\n\r\n    Mauna Loa.\r\n\r\nRising more than 9,000 meters from the seafloor, Mauna Loa is one of the\r\nworld’s largest active volcanoes; from its base below sea level to its\r\nsummit, Mauna Loa is taller than Mount Everest. It has erupted 15 times\r\nsince 1900, with eruptions lasting from less than 1 day to as many as\r\n145 days.\r\n\r\nThe most recent eruption began before dawn on March 25, 1984. Brilliant\r\nlava fountains lit the night-time sky as fissures opened across the\r\nfloor of the caldera. Within hours, the summit activity stopped and lava\r\nbegan erupting from a series of vents along the northeast rift zone.\r\nWhen the eruption stopped 3 weeks later, lava flows were only 6.5\r\nkilometers from buildings in the city of Hilo. Mauna Loa erupts less\r\nfrequently than Kilauea, but it produces a much greater volume of lava\r\nover a shorter period of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lava fountains erupt from along Mauna Loa’s rift zone.\r\nFountains are about 25 meters high. (_Photograph by J.D. Griggs._)]\r\n\r\n    Kilauea Volcano.\r\n\r\nKilauea’s longest rift-zone eruption in historical time began on January\r\n3, 1983. A row of lava fountains broke out from its east rift zone about\r\n17 kilometers from the summit caldera; within a few months, the activity\r\nsettled down to a single vent. Powerful fountaining episodes hurled\r\nmolten rock 450 meters into the air and built a cone of lava fragments\r\nthat quickly became the tallest landmark on the rift zone.\r\n\r\nThe eruption changed style abruptly in July 1986 when lava broke out\r\nthrough a new vent. Instead of regular episodes of high lava\r\nfountaining, lava spilled continuously onto Kilauea’s surface. The\r\nsteady outpouring of lava formed a lake of molten rock that became\r\nperched atop a small shield volcano. By June 1991, the shield was about\r\n60 meters tall and 1,600 meters in diameter, and lava from the eruption\r\nhad covered 75 square kilometers of forest and grassland, added 120\r\nhectares of new land to the island, and destroyed 179 homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aerial view of Hawaii’s two most active volcanoes,\r\nKilauea and Mauna Loa. (_Photograph by J.D. Griggs._)]\r\n\r\n  Mauna Loa\r\n  Halemaumau Crater\r\n  Kilauea caldera\r\n\r\nAlthough most of Kilauea’s historical rift eruptions were much briefer,\r\nprolonged eruptive activity in the east rift zone from 1969 to 1974\r\nformed a similar shield, Mauna Ulu (Hawaiian for “Growing Mountain”),\r\nand an extensive lava field on the volcano’s south flank. The geologic\r\nrecord shows that such large-volume eruptions from the rift zones and\r\nthe summit area, covering large parts of Kilauea’s surface, have\r\noccurred many times in the recent past. In fact, about 90 percent of\r\nKilauea’s surface is covered with lava flows that are less than 1,100\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The volcanic cone of Pu’u O’o, named after an extinct\r\nHawaiian bird, towers above an active lava lake (background).\r\n(_Photograph by J.D. Griggs._)]\r\n\r\nMost eruptions at Kilauea can be viewed at close range, but a few\r\nhistorical eruptions were dangerously explosive. Fast-moving mixtures of\r\nash and gas, called _pyroclastic surges_, raced across the summit area\r\nand into the southwest rift zone during an eruption in 1790. Footprints\r\npreserved in a layer of ash 30 kilometers southwest of the summit\r\nprobably include those of a party of Hawaiian warriors and their\r\nfamilies who were crossing the volcano when the eruption struck. An\r\nestimated 80 of the 250 people were killed by suffocating clouds\r\nassociated with the pyroclastic surges. A smaller explosive eruption in\r\n1924 from Halemaumau Crater in Kilauea summit caldera, which killed a\r\nphotographer who was too close, hurled rocks weighing as much as 8 tons\r\nas far as 1 kilometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lava fountain erupting from Pu’u O’o cone. Forty-four\r\nepisodes of such fountaining between 1983 and 1986 built the cone 255\r\nmeters tall. (_Photograph by J.D. Griggs._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Cascade volcanoes\r\n\r\nVolcanoes of the Cascade Range erupt far less frequently than Kilauea\r\nand Mauna Loa, but they are more dangerous because of their violently\r\nexplosive behavior and their proximity to populated and cultivated areas\r\nin Washington, Oregon, and California. The 1980 eruption of Mount St.\r\nHelens in southwest Washington dramatically illustrated the type of\r\nvolcanic activity and destruction these volcanoes can produce.\r\nScientific studies of the eruption of Mount St. Helens and the eruptive\r\nhistories of other Cascade volcanoes continue to improve public\r\nawareness and understanding of these potentially dangerous peaks.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Kilauea, Cascade volcanoes erupt a variety of magma types\r\nthat generate a wide range of eruptive behavior and build steep-sided\r\ncones known as _composite volcanoes_. In addition to basalt, andesite\r\nand dacite magmas are common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cascade Volcanoes.]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    Volcano active during past 2,000 years\r\n    Potentially active volcano\r\n    Area of potential volcanic activity\r\n  Population centers\r\n    40,000 to 100,000\r\n    100,000 to 350,000\r\n    350,000 to 1,000,000\r\n    Greater than 1,000,000\r\n  _PACIFIC OCEAN_\r\n  WASHINGTON\r\n    Mount Baker\r\n    Glacier Park\r\n    Seattle\r\n    Spokane\r\n    Mount Rainier\r\n    Mount St. Helens\r\n    Mount Adams\r\n  MONTANA\r\n    Great Falls\r\n    Billings\r\n  IDAHO\r\n    Boise\r\n    Craters of the Moon\r\n  OREGON\r\n    Portland\r\n    Mount Hood\r\n    Mount Jefferson\r\n    Three Sisters\r\n    Eugene\r\n    Newberry Crater\r\n    Crater Lake\r\n  WYOMING\r\n    Yellowstone\r\n    Casper\r\n    Cheyenne\r\n  CALIFORNIA\r\n    Medicine Lake\r\n    Mount Shasta\r\n    Lassen Peak\r\n    Clear Lake\r\n    Sacramento\r\n    San Francisco\r\n    Long Valley Caldera\r\n    Coso\r\n    Los Angeles\r\n    San Diego\r\n  NEVADA\r\n    Reno\r\n    Las Vegas\r\n  UTAH\r\n  Salt Lake City\r\n  COLORADO\r\n    Denver\r\n  ARIZONA\r\n    San Francisco Field\r\n    Phoenix\r\n    Tucson\r\n  NEW MEXICO\r\n    Albuquerque\r\n    Bandera Field\r\n\r\nThese magmas are so highly viscous, or sticky, that expanding volcanic\r\ngases cannot easily escape from them. This causes a tremendous build-up\r\nin pressure, often leading to extremely explosive eruptions. During such\r\neruptions, magma is shattered into tiny fragments (chiefly ash and\r\npumice) and ejected thousands of meters into the atmosphere or even the\r\nstratosphere. Under the force of gravity, sometimes these fragments\r\nsweep down a volcano’s flanks at speeds of more than 100 kilometers per\r\nhour, mixing with air and volcanic gases to form _pyroclastic flows_.\r\nRock fragments can also mix with water in river valleys to form _lahars_\r\n(volcanic debris flows and mudflows) that destroy everything in their\r\npaths.\r\n\r\nAndesite and dacite magmas also erupt to form lava flows. Because these\r\nlavas are more viscous (“stickier”) than basalt, they tend to form\r\nthicker flows that travel shorter distances from the vent; consequently,\r\nandesite and dacite lavas typically build tall cones with steep slopes\r\nof more than 20 degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mt. Hood, Oregon. Eruptions from the volcano about 1,800\r\nand 200 years ago from the Crater Rock lava dome formed a broad apron of\r\nrock debris on the volcano’s south side. (_Photograph by Lyn Topinka._)]\r\n\r\n    Mount Baker, Washington.\r\n\r\nEyewitness reports of small ashy plumes and active steam vents on Mount\r\nBaker dating as far back as the mid-1800’s were clear evidence that the\r\nice-covered volcano had one of the most active geothermal systems among\r\nCascade volcanoes. When new fumaroles and unusually dark vapor plumes\r\nappeared abruptly in March 1975, however, people in the Northwest became\r\nconcerned about an impending eruption and possible avalanches and lahars\r\nfrom Sherman Crater, a vent just south of Mount Baker’s summit. Despite\r\na tenfold increase in the release of heat by the volcano during the next\r\n12 months, which resulted in extensive changes to the ice cover in\r\nSherman Crater and produced minor releases of ash, no eruption occurred.\r\nThe thermal activity was not accompanied by earthquakes, which generally\r\nprecede most eruptions, and since 1976, the volcano has not showed\r\nadditional signs of activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Baker viewed to the west. Increased fumarolic\r\nactivity occurred in Sherman Crater (left of summit) during the\r\nmid-1970’s.]\r\n\r\nThe increased thermal activity between 1975 and 1976 prompted public\r\nofficials and Puget Power to temporarily close public access to the\r\npopular Baker Lake recreation area and to lower the reservoir’s water\r\nlevel by 10 meters. Significant avalanches of debris from the Sherman\r\nCrater area could have swept directly into the reservoir, triggering a\r\ndisastrous wave that would have caused loss of life and damage to the\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount Rainier towers 3,000 meters above the surrounding\r\nvalleys, all of which have been swept by lahars during the past 10,000\r\nyears. Future eruptions will probably trigger similar lahars.\r\n(_Photograph by David Wieprecht._)]\r\n\r\n    Mount Rainier, Washington.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier has not produced a significant eruption in the past 500\r\nyears, but scientists consider it to be one of the most hazardous\r\nvolcanoes in the Cascades. Mount Rainier has 26 glaciers containing more\r\nthan five times as much snow and ice as all the other Cascade volcanoes\r\ncombined. If only a small part of this ice were melted by volcanic\r\nactivity, it would yield enough water to trigger enormous lahars.\r\n\r\nMount Rainier’s potential for generating destructive mudflows is\r\nenhanced by its great height above surrounding valleys and its “soft”\r\ninterior. The volcano stands about 3,000 meters above river valleys\r\nleading from its base. Volcanic heat and ground water have turned some\r\nof the volcano’s originally hard lava into soft clay minerals, thereby\r\nweakening its internal structure. These conditions make Mount Rainier\r\nextremely susceptible to large landslides. Several have occurred in the\r\npast few thousand years, one as recently as about 600 years ago. These\r\nlandslides, apparently containing great volumes of water, quickly turned\r\ninto lahars as they rushed down river valleys.\r\n\r\n    Mount St. Helens, Washington.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980, was preceded by 2 months of\r\nintense activity that included more than 10,000 earthquakes, hundreds of\r\nsmall _phreatic_ (steam-blast) explosions, and the outward growth of the\r\nvolcano’s entire north flank by more than 80 meters. A magnitude 5.1\r\nearthquake struck beneath the volcano at 08:32 on May 18, setting in\r\nmotion the devastating eruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mount St. Helens crater and lava dome viewed from the\r\nnorth, 1990. Inset: Close view of lava dome with new lava extrusion on\r\ntop (snow-free part) from the south, 1986. (_Photographs by Lyn\r\nTopinka._)]\r\n\r\nWithin seconds of the earthquake, the volcano’s bulging north flank slid\r\naway in the largest landslide in recorded history, triggering a\r\ndestructive, lethal lateral blast of hot gas, steam, and rock debris\r\nthat swept across the landscape as fast as 1,100 kilometers per hour.\r\nTemperatures within the blast reached as high as 300 degrees Celsius.\r\nSnow and ice on the volcano melted, forming torrents of water and rock\r\ndebris that swept down river valleys leading from the volcano. Within\r\nminutes, a massive plume of ash thrust 19 kilometers into the sky, where\r\nthe prevailing wind carried about 520 million tons of ash across 57,000\r\nsquare kilometers of the Western United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stand of timber in the process of being harvested was\r\ninstead knocked over by the lateral blast.

Geologists now realize\r\nthat large landslides from volcanoes are far more common than previously\r\nthought—seventeen such volcanic landslides have occurred worldwide in\r\nthe past 400 years. Consequently, when scientists evaluate the types of\r\nvolcanic activity that may endanger people, giant landslides are now\r\nincluded, in addition to other types of volcanic activity such as lava\r\nflows, pyroclastic flows, lahars, and falling ash.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 1980 explosive eruption, more than a dozen extrusions of\r\nthick, pasty lava built a mound-shaped lava dome in the new crater. The\r\ndome is about 1,100 meters in diameter and 250 meters tall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Giant mushroom-shaped ash cloud of May 22, 1915, viewed\r\nfrom 80 kilometers west of Lassen Peak. (_Photograph provided by\r\nNational Park Service._)]\r\n\r\n    Lassen Peak, California.\r\n\r\nLong before the recent activity of Mount St. Helens, a series of\r\nspectacular eruptions from Lassen Peak between 1914 and 1917\r\ndemonstrated the explosive potential of Cascade volcanoes. Small\r\nphreatic explosions began on May 30, 1914, and were followed during the\r\nnext 12 months by more than 150 explosions that sent clouds of ash as\r\nhigh as 3 kilometers above the peak. The activity changed character in\r\nMay 1915, when a lava flow was observed in the summit crater. A deep red\r\nglow from the hot lava was visible at night 34 kilometers away. On May\r\n19, an avalanche of hot rocks from the lava spilled onto snow and\r\ntriggered a lahar that extended more than 15 kilometers from the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nThe most destructive explosion occurred on May 21, when a pyroclastic\r\nflow devastated forests as far as 6.5 kilometers northeast of the summit\r\nand lahars swept down several valleys radiating from the volcano. An\r\nenormous ash plume rose more than 9 kilometers above the peak, and the\r\nprevailing winds scattered the ash across Nevada as far as 500\r\nkilometers to the east. Lassen Peak continued to produce smaller\r\neruptions until about the middle of 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Alaskan volcanoes\r\n\r\nThe Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands have about 80 major\r\nvolcanic centers that consist of one or more volcanoes. Recent violent\r\neruptions have demonstrated that volcanic hazards do exist in some areas\r\nof Alaska, even though it is sparsely populated. Alaskan volcanoes have\r\nproduced one or two eruptions per year since 1900. At least 20\r\ncatastrophic caldera-forming eruptions have occurred in the past 10,000\r\nyears; the awesome eruption of 1912 at Novarupta in the Katmai National\r\nMonument is the most recent. Scientists are particularly concerned about\r\nthe volcanoes whose eruptions can affect the Cook Inlet region, where 60\r\npercent of Alaska’s population lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alaskan volcanoes.]\r\n\r\n  EXPLANATION\r\n    Volcano active during past 2,000 years\r\n    • Population center 100,000 to 350,000\r\n  ALASKA\r\n    Wrangell\r\n    Hayes\r\n    •Anchorage\r\n    Spurr\r\n    Redoubt\r\n    Iliamna\r\n    Akutan\r\n    Novarupta\r\n    Augustine\r\n    _Cook Inlet_\r\n    Trident\r\n    Bogoslof\r\n    Ukinrek\r\n    Martin\r\n    Mageik\r\n    Kagamil\r\n    Chiginagak\r\n    Ugashik-Peulik\r\n    Carlisle\r\n    Emmons Lake\r\n    Yantami\r\n    Kiska\r\n    Cerberus\r\n    Fisher\r\n    Dutton\r\n    Aniakchak\r\n    Veniaminof\r\n    Little Sitkin\r\n    Kasatochi\r\n    Amukta\r\n    Pyre\r\n    Pavlof\r\n    Isanotski\r\n    Westdahl\r\n    Shishaldin\r\n    Makushin\r\n    Gareloi\r\n    Vsevidof\r\n    Okmok\r\n    Tanaga\r\n    Korovin\r\n    Cleveland\r\n    Kanaga\r\n    Great Sitkin\r\n    Yunaska\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, erupting on December 16, 1989.\r\n(_Photograph by National Park Service._)]\r\n\r\n    Redoubt Volcano.\r\n\r\nRedoubt Volcano erupted for the fourth time this century on December 14,\r\n1989. Following several days of strong explosive activity, a series of\r\nlava domes grew in Redoubt’s summit crater during the next four months.\r\nMost of the domes were destroyed by explosions or collapsed down the\r\nvolcano’s north flank. Some of these events triggered small pyroclastic\r\nflows that melted snow and ice on the volcano to form lahars in Drift\r\nRiver Valley, which empties into Cook Inlet 35 kilometers away.\r\n\r\nAsh produced by the eruptions severely affected air traffic enroute to\r\nAnchorage, Alaska’s largest city and a major hub of domestic and\r\ninternational commercial air traffic. Many domestic carriers suspended\r\nservice to Alaska following major explosive events, and several\r\ninternational carriers temporarily rerouted flights around Alaska. On\r\nDecember 15, a jetliner enroute to Japan encountered an ash cloud while\r\ndescending into Anchorage. The plane quickly lost power in all four\r\nengines and lost 4,000 meters in altitude before the pilots were able to\r\nrestart the engines. The aircraft landed safely in Anchorage, but it\r\nsustained more than $80 million in damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lava dome in the summit crater of Redoubt Volcano, which\r\ngrew between April 21 and June 1990.

Oil is pumped from more than a\r\ndozen wells in Cook Inlet to the facility and then loaded onto tankers,\r\nwhich dock just offshore. A lahar on January 2 flooded part of the\r\nfacility with nearly a meter of water, forcing its shutdown until\r\nworkers could restore power. This and subsequent lahars prompted the\r\nCook Inlet Pipeline Company to temporarily halt oil production from some\r\noil wells and reduce the amount of oil stored at the facility between\r\ntanker loadings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rock from the lava dome of Redoubt Volcano deposited in a\r\nriver valley by a lahar during an eruption on January 8, 1990.

Yount._)]\r\n\r\n    Augustine Volcano.\r\n\r\nOne of the most active volcanoes in Cook Inlet is Augustine, whose\r\nsymmetrical cone rises 1,254 meters above the sea. Since Captain James\r\nCook discovered and named it in 1778, Augustine has erupted in 1812,\r\n1883, 1935, 1963-64, 1976, and 1986. Curiously, the quiet intervals\r\nbetween these eruptions apparently have shortened from 70 to 10 years.\r\n\r\nAugustine’s 1986 eruption was similar to the pattern of events observed\r\nin 1976. After eight months of earthquake activity beneath the volcano,\r\na violent explosion began on March 26. Billowing ash plumes rose more\r\nthan 10 kilometers above the vent, pyroclastic flows sped down the\r\nvolcano’s flanks into the sea, and ash spread throughout Cook Inlet. A\r\nsecond stage began April 23, when lava began erupting near the volcano’s\r\nsummit and added about 25 meters to the top of the existing lava dome.\r\nSmall pyroclastic flows accompanied growth of the dome.\r\n\r\nScientists were worried that this eruption might trigger a giant\r\nlandslide from Augustine’s steep upper cone, which could enter the sea\r\nto create a _tsunami_ (powerful seismic sea wave). At least 12\r\nlandslides are known to have occurred at Augustine. The most recent\r\nslide took place at the onset of the 1883 eruption when a part of the\r\nvolcano’s summit collapsed into the sea. Within one hour, a tsunami as\r\nhigh as 9 meters crashed ashore on the coast of the Kenai Peninsula 80\r\nkilometers away. No one was killed and property damage was only minor\r\nbecause the tsunami hit at low tide. Subsequent eruptions have rebuilt a\r\nsteep cone of overlapping lava domes similar to the cone that existed\r\njust before the 1883 landslide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pyroclastic flow descending the upper flanks of Augustine\r\nVolcano. (_Photograph by M.E. Yount._)]\r\n\r\n    Novarupta, Katmai National Monument.\r\n\r\nThe largest eruption in the world this century occurred in 1912 at\r\nNovarupta on the Alaska Peninsula. An estimated 15 cubic kilometers of\r\nmagma was explosively erupted during 60 hours beginning on June 6—about\r\n30 times the volume erupted by Mount St. Helens in 1980! The expulsion\r\nof such a large volume of magma excavated a funnel-shaped vent 2\r\nkilometers wide and triggered the collapse of Mount Katmai volcano 10\r\nkilometers away to form a summit caldera 600 meters deep and about 3\r\nkilometers across. Extrusion of the lava dome, called Novarupta, near\r\nthe center of the 1912 vent marked the end of the eruption.\r\n\r\nLittle was known about the spectacular effects of this great eruption\r\nuntil 1916, when a scientific expedition sponsored by the National\r\nGeographic Society visited the area. To their amazement, they found a\r\nbroad valley northwest of Novarupta marked by a flat plain of loose,\r\n“sandy” ash material from which thousands of jets of steam were hissing.\r\nThe eruption had produced pyroclastic flows that swept about 21\r\nkilometers down the upper Ukak River valley. The thickness of the\r\nresulting pumice and ash deposits in the upper valley is not known but\r\nmay be as great as 200 meters. In 1916, the deposits were still hot\r\nenough to boil water and form countless steaming fumaroles; hence the\r\nexpedition named this part of the Ukak River the “Valley of Ten Thousand\r\nSmokes.”\r\n\r\n    Trident Volcano.\r\n\r\nEruptions of andesitic lava flows between 1953 and 1960 built a new cone\r\non Trident’s southwest flank, adding yet another to the volcano’s older\r\ncomplex of three overlapping cones (hence the name Trident). A huge\r\ncloud of rising ash was seen on February 15, 1953, in the direction of\r\nKatmai National Monument; 3 days later clear weather permitted U.S. Navy\r\npilots to spot a blocky lava flow emerging from Trident’s southwest\r\nflank. Slow extrusion of lava during the next 4 months built an\r\nirregularly shaped lava dome about 1.5 kilometers long and 600 meters\r\ntall. Trident continued to erupt intermittently through 1960, generating\r\nthree lava flows as long as 4.5 kilometers from the same vent and\r\nnumerous ash-producing explosive eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Novarupta lava dome, Mt. Katmai, and Trident Volcano,\r\nAlaska.

Yount._)]\r\n\r\n    Mount Veniaminof.\r\n\r\nMount Veniaminof is a massive composite volcano with a summit caldera\r\nabout 8 kilometers in diameter. Since its formation about 3,700 years\r\nago, the caldera has filled with ice to a depth of at least 60 meters.\r\nBetween June 1983 and January 1984, a series of small explosions, lava\r\nfountains, and lava flows erupted from a small cinder cone within the\r\ncaldera. The explosions hurled molten lava from the cinder cone, and\r\nlava flows melted a pit about 1.5 kilometers in diameter in the ice near\r\nthe base of the volcano. Water from the melting ice formed a temporary\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n    Mount Spurr.\r\n\r\nThe summit cone of Mount Spurr consists of a large lava dome built in\r\nthe center of a horseshoe-shaped crater formed earlier by a large\r\nlandslide. At the southern edge of this ancient crater is a younger,\r\nmore active cone known as Crater Peak. Scientists have determined that\r\nCrater Peak is the source for at least 35 ash layers found in the Cook\r\nInlet area, all of which were erupted in the past 6,000 years. Until\r\nrecently, a warm turquoise-colored lake partially filled its crater.\r\n\r\nA series of explosive eruptions from Crater Peak on June 27, 1992,\r\ngenerated ash plumes as high as about 14 kilometers, small pyroclastic\r\nflows that swept down the south and east sides of the cone, and small\r\nlahars. The reawakening of Crater Peak followed nearly a year of\r\nincreased earthquake activity, which escalated further on June 26, less\r\nthan 1 day before its first eruption. Not all of the explosive episodes\r\nwere preceded by a change in seismicity beneath the volcano, a condition\r\nthat required scientists to maintain a 24-hour watch for extended\r\nperiods of time in order to issue sudden reports and warnings of\r\neruptive activity. The west side of Cook Inlet received a light to\r\nmoderate ashfall during the largest explosive episode on August 18;\r\nAnchorage was blanketed with about 3 millimeters of ash, causing the\r\nAnchorage International Airport to close for a few hours. During an\r\neruption at night on September 17, a spectacular display of lightning\r\nand incandescent ballistics and pyroclastic flows were witnessed by\r\nhunters who camped about 18 kilometers to the southeast; a faint glow\r\nabove Crater Peak was also visible from as far away as Anchorage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steaming Crater Peak, a satellite vent on the south side\r\nof Mount Spurr volcano, produced three explosive eruptions in 1992.\r\n(_Photograph by Cynthia Gardner._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aerial view of the Mono-Inyo Craters Volcanic Chain,\r\nCalifornia.

When such a large\r\nvolume of magma is removed from beneath a volcano, the ground subsides\r\nor collapses into the emptied space, to form a huge depression called a\r\ncaldera. Some calderas are more than 25 kilometers in diameter and\r\nseveral kilometers deep.\r\n\r\nCalderas are among the most spectacular and active volcanic features on\r\nEarth. Earthquakes, ground cracks, uplift or subsidence of the ground,\r\nand thermal activity such as hot springs, geysers, and boiling mud pots\r\nare common at many calderas. Such activity is caused by complex\r\ninteractions among magma stored beneath a caldera, ground water, and the\r\nregional build-up of stress in the large plates of the Earth’s crust.\r\nSignificant changes in the level of activity at some calderas are\r\ncommon; these new activity levels can be intermittent, lasting for\r\nmonths to years, or persistent over decades to centuries. Although most\r\ncaldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent\r\nexplosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of\r\nsome active calderas.\r\n\r\nRecently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in\r\nthe United States, Long Valley Caldera in eastern California and\r\nYellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Whether\r\nunrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is\r\nthe early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still\r\nunanswered question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yellowstone River plummets through the famous Grand\r\nCanyon of Yellowstone. Carved by the river, the “yellow” rocks of the\r\ncanyon are rhyolite lava flows that have been altered by hot water. The\r\nlava flows were erupted after the most recent caldera-forming eruption\r\nabout 600,000 years ago.]\r\n\r\n    Long Valley Caldera, California.\r\n\r\nLong Valley Caldera lies on the eastern front of the Sierra Nevada,\r\nabout 300 kilometers east of San Francisco. A huge explosive eruption\r\nabout 700,000 years ago formed the caldera and produced pyroclastic\r\nflows that traveled 65 kilometers from the vent and covered an area of\r\nabout 1,500 square kilometers. Ash from the caldera-forming eruption\r\nfell as far east as Nebraska. Within the past 40,000 years, eruptions\r\nhave been restricted to a linear zone of vents, including the Mono-Inyo\r\nCraters Volcanic Chain, that extends about 50 kilometers north from the\r\nnorthwest part of the caldera.\r\n\r\nThis volcanic chain consists of many vents that have erupted in the past\r\nseveral thousand years. Eruptions from vents as recently as 550 years\r\nago produced lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and ash, all of rhyolitic\r\ncomposition. Geologic mapping shows that some eruptions were preceded by\r\nground cracking, suggesting that the ground was pulled apart or\r\nstretched as magma neared the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of Long Valley Caldera and the Mono-Inyo Craters\r\nVolcanic Chain in central California, viewed from the southeast.\r\n(_Sketch by Tau Rho Alpha._)]\r\n\r\n  Sierra Nevada\r\n  Mono craters\r\n  Inyo craters\r\n  Mammoth Lakes\r\n  Resurgent dome\r\n  Long Valley Caldera\r\n\r\nThree moderate earthquakes south of the caldera and one beneath the\r\ncaldera on May 25-26, 1980, marked the beginning of unrest that\r\ncontinues into the 1990’s. Swarms of earthquakes beneath the caldera,\r\nchanges in several hot springs, and the formation of new springs have\r\noccurred since 1980. Precise surveys have also shown that the central\r\npart of the caldera has risen by more than 50 centimeters since 1975.\r\nThis unrest is probably related to the stretching (east-west extension)\r\nof the Earth’s crust that is known to be occurring in the region around\r\nthe caldera, and it probably also involves the rise of magma beneath the\r\ncaldera. Scientists do not know if this unrest will lead to volcanic\r\nactivity, but the geologically recent eruptions along the Mono-Inyo\r\nCraters Volcanic Chain suggest that future eruptions are possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: South Inyo Crater, Long Valley Caldera, California.\r\nExplosive eruptions formed the crater about 500 years ago.

The spectacular geysers, boiling hot springs, and mud pots\r\nthat have made Yellowstone famous—and even the strikingly beautiful\r\nGrand Canyon of Yellowstone through which the Yellowstone River\r\nplunges—owe their existence to the tremendous volcanic forces that have\r\naffected the region during the past 2 million years. Cataclysmic\r\neruptions 2.0, 1.3, and 0.6 million years ago ejected huge volumes of\r\nrhyolite magma; each eruption formed a caldera and extensive layers of\r\nthick pyroclastic-flow deposits. The youngest caldera is an elliptical\r\ndepression, nearly 80 kilometers long and 50 kilometers wide, that\r\noccupies much of Yellowstone National Park. The caldera is buried by\r\nseveral extensive rhyolite lava flows erupted between 75,000 and 150,000\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of most recent Yellowstone Caldera and its main\r\nthermal features.

Scientists do not know the\r\ncause of these ups and downs but hypothesize that they are related to\r\nthe addition or withdrawal of magma beneath the caldera, or to the\r\nchanging pressure of the hot ground water system above Yellowstone’s\r\nlarge magma reservoir. Also, Yellowstone National Park and the area\r\nimmediately west of the Park are historically among the most seismically\r\nactive areas in the Rocky Mountains. Small-magnitude earthquakes are\r\ncommon beneath the entire caldera, but most are located along the Hebgen\r\nLake fault zone that extends into the northwest part of the caldera. A\r\nmagnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred along this zone in 1959.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Castle Geyser erupting a column of hot water, Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. (_Photograph by Steven R.

Although many of these ancient rocks were\r\nremoved by erosion, volcanic deposits can be found beneath younger rocks\r\nin many parts of the United States. To a geologist, such long-lasting\r\nvolcanic rocks look like those formed by today’s active volcanoes. Many\r\nancient volcanic rocks, however, change somewhat with time, as they\r\nbecome firmly consolidated, buried by younger deposits, and sometimes\r\nfolded and faulted by the continuous shifting of the Earth’s crust. Even\r\nminerals of volcanic rocks may change, if after burial they encounter\r\nhigh pressures and temperatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Columnar jointing in an ancient lava flow in the Blue\r\nRidge Mountains, Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. The flow that\r\ncontains the columns is one of an extensive series of lava flows, each\r\naveraging about 200 feet thick, that poured over the land more than 570\r\nmillion years ago. Columns form as cooling or shrinkage joints when a\r\nhot lava flow cools quickly; the columns form perpendicular to the\r\ncooling surface. These columns are about .5 meter in diameter.\r\n(_Photograph by J.C. Reed, Jr._)]\r\n\r\nMost active volcanoes are built on older volcanic deposits erupted from\r\nancient volcanoes, and visitors to the present-day volcanoes walk or\r\ndrive across these products of past volcanism. For example, anyone\r\ndriving across the Cascade Range, sunbathing at Waikiki, or fishing on\r\nthe Alaska Peninsula is there because old volcanic rocks form the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nOne step further back in time from today’s active volcanoes are people\r\nwho picnic in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, enjoy the autumn\r\ncolors in the Blue Ridge of Shenandoah National Park, and hike in the\r\nrugged Big Bend National Park of Texas. Many of the rocks in these areas\r\nwere formed by eruptions or by intrusion of magma into the Earth’s crust\r\nmany millions of years ago. Because volcanic activity has been so\r\nimportant in shaping the Earth, watching active volcanoes today provides\r\na window through which we can glimpse and reconstruct the early volcanic\r\nhistory of our planet.\r\n\r\nAs we increase our knowledge about volcanic processes, by studying\r\nvolcanoes erupting today as well as those that have lain dormant for\r\nhundreds to thousands of years, we increase our ability to predict when\r\nand how volcanoes will erupt. Accurate predictions, presented in terms\r\nthat are meaningful to public officials, will minimize the number of\r\nlives lost and the social and economic upheaval that an eruption can\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thick layers of volcanic rocks form the Superstition\r\nMountains, located about 60 kilometers east of Phoenix, Arizona.

The term\r\n                    comes from Indonesia.\r\n  Lava              Molten rock that erupts from a vent or fissure;\r\n                    see magma.\r\n  Magma             Molten rock that contains dissolved gas and\r\n                    crystals, formed deep within the Earth. When\r\n                    magma reaches the surface, it is called lava.\r\n  Phreatic          A type of volcanic explosion that occurs when\r\n  eruption          water comes in contact with hot rocks or ash near\r\n                    a volcanic vent, causing steam explosions.\r\n  Pumice            A light-colored volcanic rock containing abundant\r\n                    trapped gas bubbles formed by the explosive\r\n                    eruption of magma. Because of its numerous gas\r\n                    bubbles, pumice commonly floats on water.\r\n  Pyroclastic flow  A hot, fast-moving and high-density mixture of\r\n                    ash, pumice, rock fragments, and gas formed\r\n                    during explosive eruptions.\r\n  Pyroclastic       Same process as pyroclastic flow but of much\r\n  surge             lower density.\r\n  Rhyolite          A volcanic rock containing more than 68% silica\r\n                    with a very high viscosity when in a molten state.\r\n  Shield volcano    A volcano shaped like an inverted warrior’s\r\n                    shield with long gentle slopes produced by\r\n                    eruptions of low-viscosity basaltic lava.\r\n  Silica            The molecule formed of silicon and oxygen (SiO₂)\r\n                    that is the basic building block of volcanic\r\n                    rocks and the most important factor controlling\r\n                    the fluidity of magma. The higher a magma’s\r\n                    silica content, the greater its viscosity or\r\n                    “stickiness.”\r\n  Vent              The opening at the Earth’s surface through which\r\n                    volcanic materials (magma and gas) escape.\r\n  Volcano           A vent in the surface of the Earth through which\r\n                    magma erupts and also the landform that is\r\n                    constructed by the erupted material.\r\n  Volcanic          The downslope movement of soil, rock debris, and\r\n  landslide         sometimes glacial ice, with or without water,\r\n                    from the flank of a volcano.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scientist surveying lava dome at Redoubt Volcano.\r\n(_Photograph by G.
