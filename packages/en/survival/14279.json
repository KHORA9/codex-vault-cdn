ALLEYNE NICHOLSON\r\n\r\nM.D., D.SC., M.A., PH. D. (GÖTT), F.R.S.E, F.L.S.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF NATURAL HISTORY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF ST ANDREWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe study of Palæontology, or the science which is concerned\r\nwith the living beings which flourished upon the globe during\r\npast periods of its history, may be pursued by two parallel but\r\nessentially distinct paths. By the one method of inquiry, we may\r\nstudy the anatomical characters and structure of the innumerable\r\nextinct forms of life which lie buried in the rocks simply as\r\nso many organisms, with but a slight and secondary reference\r\nto the _time_ at which they lived. By the other method, fossil\r\nanimals are regarded principally as so many landmarks in the\r\nancient records of the world, and are studied _historically_\r\nand as regards their relations to the chronological succession\r\nof the strata in which they are entombed. In so doing, it is of\r\ncourse impossible to wholly ignore their structural characters,\r\nand their relationships with animals now living upon the earth;\r\nbut these points are held to occupy a subordinate place, and to\r\nrequire nothing more than a comparatively general attention.\r\n\r\nIn a former work, the Author has endeavoured to furnish a summary\r\nof the more important facts of Palæontology regarded in its strictly\r\nscientific aspect, as a mere department of the great science of\r\nBiology. The present work, on the other hand, is an attempt to\r\ntreat Palæontology more especially from its historical side, and\r\nin its more intimate relations with Geology. In accordance with\r\nthis object, the introductory portion of the work is devoted to a\r\nconsideration of the general principles of Palæontology, and the\r\nbearings of this science upon various geological problems--such\r\nas the mode of formation of the sedimentary rocks, the reactions\r\nof living beings upon the crust of the earth, and the sequence\r\nin time of the fossiliferous formations. The second portion of\r\nthe work deals exclusively with Historical Palæontology, each\r\nformation being considered separately, as regards its lithological\r\nnature and subdivisions, its relations to other formations, its\r\ngeographical distribution, its mode of origin, and its characteristic\r\nlife-forms.\r\n\r\nIn the consideration of the characteristic fossils of each successive\r\nperiod, a general account is given of their more important zoological\r\ncharacters and their relations to living forms; but the technical\r\nlanguage of Zoology has been avoided, and the aid of illustrations\r\nhas been freely called into use. It may therefore be hoped that\r\nthe work may be found to be available for the purposes of both the\r\nGeological and the Zoological student; since it is essentially an\r\noutline of Historical Palæontology, and the student of either of\r\nthe above-mentioned sciences must perforce possess some knowledge\r\nof the last. Whilst primarily intended for students, it may be\r\nadded that the method of treatment adopted has been so far\r\nuntechnical as not to render the work useless to the general\r\nreader who may desire to acquire some knowledge of a subject of\r\nsuch vast and universal interest.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the object which he has held before him, the\r\nAuthor can hardly expect, from the nature of the materials with\r\nwhich he has had to deal, that he has kept himself absolutely\r\nclear of errors, both of omission and commission. The subject,\r\nhowever, is one to which he has devoted the labour of many years,\r\nboth in studying the researches of others and in personal\r\ninvestigations of his own; and he can only trust that such errors\r\nas may exist will be found to belong chiefly to the former class,\r\nand to be neither serious nor numerous. It need only be added\r\nthat the work is necessarily very limited in its scope, and that\r\nthe necessity of not assuming a thorough previous acquaintance\r\nwith Natural History in the reader has inexorably restricted its\r\nrange still further. The Author does not, therefore, profess to\r\nhave given more than a merely general outline of the subject; and\r\nthose who desire to obtain a more minute and detailed knowledge\r\nof Palæontology, must have recourse to other and more elaborate\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nUNITED COLLEGE, ST ANDREWS.\r\n\r\nOctober 2, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF

In this limited aspect, Geology is nothing more than\r\nthe Physical Geography of the past, just as Physical Geography\r\nis the Geology of to-day; and though it has to call in the aid\r\nof Physics, Astronomy, Mineralogy, Chemistry, and other allies\r\nmore remote, it is in itself a perfectly distinct and individual\r\nstudy. One has, however, only to cross the threshold of Geology\r\nto discover that the field and scope of the science cannot be\r\nthus rigidly limited to purely physical problems. The study of\r\nthe physical development of the earth throughout past ages brings\r\nus at once in contact with the forms of animal and vegetable\r\nlife which peopled its surface in bygone epochs, and it is found\r\nimpossible adequately to comprehend the former, unless we possess\r\nsome knowledge of the latter. However great its physical advances\r\nmay be, Geology remains imperfect till it is wedded with\r\nPalæontology,[2] a study which essentially belongs to the vast\r\ncomplex of the Biological Sciences, but at the same time has its\r\nstrictly geological side. Dealing, as it does, wholly with the\r\nconsideration of such living beings as do not belong exclusively\r\nto the present order of things, Palæontology is, in reality, a\r\nbranch of Natural History, and may be regarded as substantially\r\nthe Zoology and Botany of the past. It is the ancient life-history\r\nof the earth, as revealed to us by the labours of palæontologists,\r\nwith which we have mainly to do here; but before entering upon\r\nthis, there are some general questions, affecting Geology and\r\nPalæontology alike, which may be very briefly discussed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gr. _ge_, the earth; _logos_, a discourse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Gr. _palaios_, ancient; _onta_, beings; _logos_,\r\ndiscourse.]\r\n\r\nThe working geologist, dealing in the main with purely physical\r\nproblems, has for his object to determine the material structure\r\nof the earth, and to investigate, as far as may be, the long chain\r\nof causes of which that structure is the ultimate result. No wider\r\nor more extended field of inquiry could be found; but philosophical\r\ngeology is not content with this. At all the confines of his\r\nscience, the transcendental geologist finds himself confronted\r\nwith some of the most stupendous problems which have ever engaged\r\nthe restless intellect of humanity. The origin and primæval\r\nconstitution of the terrestrial globe, the laws of geologic action\r\nthrough long ages of vicissitude and development, the origin of\r\nlife, the nature and source of the myriad complexities of living\r\nbeings, the advent of man, possibly even the future history of\r\nthe earth, are amongst the questions with which the geologist\r\nhas to grapple in his higher capacity.\r\n\r\nThese are problems which have occupied the attention of philosophers\r\nin every age of the world, and in periods long antecedent to\r\nthe existence of a science of geology. The mere existence of\r\ncosmogonies in the religion of almost every nation, both ancient\r\nand modern, is a sufficient proof of the eager desire of the\r\nhuman mind to know something of the origin of the earth on which\r\nwe tread. Every human being who has gazed on the vast panorama\r\nof the universe, though it may have been but with the eyes of\r\na child, has felt the longing to solve, however imperfectly,\r\n\"the riddle of the painful earth,\" and has, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, elaborated some sort of a theory as to the why and\r\nwherefore of what he sees. Apart from the profound and perhaps\r\ninscrutable problems which lie at the bottom of human existence,\r\nmen have in all ages invented theories to explain the common\r\nphenomena of the material universe; and most of these theories,\r\nhowever varied in their details, turn out on examination to have a\r\ncommon root, and to be based on the same elements. Modern geology\r\nhas its own theories on the same subject, and it will be well to\r\nglance for a moment at the principles underlying the old and\r\nthe new views.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained, as a metaphysical hypothesis, that there\r\nexists in the mind of man an inherent principle, in virtue of\r\nwhich he believes and expects that what has been, will be; and\r\nthat the course of nature will be a continuous and uninterrupted\r\none. So far, however, from any such belief existing as a necessary\r\nconsequence of the constitution of the human mind, the real fact\r\nseems to be that the contrary belief has been almost universally\r\nprevalent. In all old religions, and in the philosophical systems\r\nof almost all ancient nations, the order of the universe has\r\nbeen regarded as distinctly unstable, mutable, and temporary.\r\nA beginning and an end have always been assumed, and the course\r\nof terrestrial events between these two indefinite points has\r\nbeen regarded as liable to constant interruption by revolutions\r\nand catastrophes of different kinds, in many cases emanating from\r\nsupernatural sources. Few of the more ancient theological creeds,\r\nand still fewer of the ancient philosophies, attained body and\r\nshape without containing, in some form or another, the belief\r\nin the existence of periodical convulsions, and of alternating\r\ncycles of destruction and repair.\r\n\r\nThat geology, in its early infancy, should have become imbued\r\nwith the spirit of this belief, is no more than might have been\r\nexpected; and hence arose the at one time powerful and\r\ngenerally-accepted doctrine of \"Catastrophism.\" That the succession\r\nof phenomena upon the globe, whereby the earth's crust had assumed\r\nthe configuration and composition which we find it to possess,\r\nhad been a discontinuous and broken succession, was the almost\r\ninevitable conclusion of the older geologists. Everywhere in\r\ntheir study of the rocks they met with apparently impassable\r\ngaps, and breaches of continuity that could not be bridged over.\r\nEverywhere they found themselves conducted abruptly from one system\r\nof deposits to others totally different in mineral character or\r\nin stratigraphical position. Everywhere they discovered that\r\nwell-marked and easily recognisable groups of animals and plants\r\nwere succeeded, without the intermediation of any obvious lapse\r\nof time, by other assemblages of organic beings of a different\r\ncharacter. Everywhere they found evidence that the earth's crust\r\nhad undergone changes of such magnitude as to render it seemingly\r\nirrational to suppose that they could have been produced by any\r\nprocess now in existence. If we add to the above the prevalent\r\nbelief of the time as to the comparative brevity of the period\r\nwhich had elapsed since the birth of the globe, we can readily\r\nunderstand the general acceptance of some form of catastrophism\r\namongst the earlier geologists.\r\n\r\nAs regards its general sense and substance, the doctrine of\r\ncatastrophism held that the history of the earth, since first\r\nit emerged from the primitive chaos, had been one of periods\r\nof repose, alternating with catastrophes and cataclysms of a\r\nmore or less violent character. The periods of tranquillity were\r\nsupposed to have been long and protracted; and during each of them\r\nit was thought that one of the great geological \"formations\" was\r\ndeposited. In each of these periods, therefore, the condition of\r\nthe earth was supposed to be much the same as it is now--sediment\r\nwas quietly accumulated at the bottom of the sea, and animals and\r\nplants flourished uninterruptedly in successive generations.\r\nEach period of tranquillity, however, was believed to have been,\r\nsooner or later, put an end to by a sudden and awful convulsion\r\nof nature, ushering in a brief and paroxysmal period, in which\r\nthe great physical forces were unchained and permitted to spring\r\ninto a portentous activity. The forces of subterranean fire,\r\nwith their concomitant phenomena of earthquake and volcano, were\r\nchiefly relied upon as the efficient causes of these periods of\r\nspasm and revolution. Enormous elevations of portions of the\r\nearth's crust were thus believed to be produced, accompanied by\r\ncorresponding and equally gigantic depressions of other portions.\r\nIn this way new ranges of mountains were produced, and previously\r\nexisting ranges levelled with the ground, seas were converted into\r\ndry land, and continents buried beneath the ocean--catastrophe\r\nfollowing catastrophe, till the earth was rendered uninhabitable,\r\nand its races of animals and plants were extinguished, never to\r\nreappear in the same form. Finally, it was believed that this\r\nfeverish activity ultimately died out, and that the ancient peace\r\nonce more came to reign upon the earth. As the abnormal throes\r\nand convulsions began to be relieved, the dry land and sea once\r\nmore resumed their relations of stability, the conditions of\r\nlife were once more established, and new races of animals and\r\nplants sprang into existence, to last until the supervention\r\nof another fever-fit.\r\n\r\nSuch is the past history of the globe, as sketched for us, in\r\nalternating scenes of fruitful peace and revolutionary destruction,\r\nby the earlier geologists. As before said, we cannot wonder at the\r\nformer general acceptance of Catastrophistic doctrines. Even in\r\nthe light of our present widely-increased knowledge, the series\r\nof geological monuments remains a broken and imperfect one; nor\r\ncan we ever hope to fill up completely the numerous gaps with\r\nwhich the geological record is defaced. Catastrophism was the\r\nnatural method of accounting for these gaps, and, as we shall see,\r\nit possesses a basis of truth. At present, however, catastrophism\r\nmay be said to be nearly extinct, and its place is taken by the\r\nmodern doctrine of \"Continuity\" or \"Uniformity\"--a doctrine with\r\nwhich the name of Lyell must ever remain imperishably associated.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental thesis of the doctrine of Uniformity is, that,\r\nin spite of all apparent violations of continuity, the sequence\r\nof geological phenomena has in reality been a regular and\r\nuninterrupted one; and that the vast changes which can be shown\r\nto have passed over the earth in former periods have been the\r\nresult of the slow and ceaseless working of the ordinary physical\r\nforces--acting with no greater intensity than they do now, but\r\nacting through enormously prolonged periods. The essential element\r\nin the theory of Continuity is to be found in the allotment of\r\nindefinite time for the accomplishment of the known series of\r\ngeological changes. It is obviously the case, namely, that there\r\nare two possible explanations of all phenomena which lie so far\r\nconcealed in \"the dark backward and abysm of time,\" that we can\r\nhave no direct knowledge of the manner in which they were produced.\r\nWe may, on the one hand, suppose them to be the result of some\r\nvery powerful cause, acting through a short period of time. That\r\nis Catastrophism. Or, we may suppose them to be caused by a much\r\nweaker force operating through a proportionately prolonged period.\r\nThis is the view of the Uniformitarians. It is a question of\r\n_energy_ versus _time_ and it is _time_ which is the true element\r\nof the case. An earthquake may remove a mountain in the course\r\nof a few seconds; but the dropping of the gentle rain will do\r\nthe same, if we extend its operations over a millennium. And\r\nthis is true of all agencies which are now at work, or ever have\r\nbeen at work, upon our planet. The Catastrophists, believing\r\nthat the globe is but, as it were, the birth of yesterday, were\r\ndriven of necessity to the conclusion that its history had been\r\ncheckered by the intermittent action of paroxysmal and almost\r\ninconceivably potent forces. The Uniformitarians, on the other\r\nhand, maintaining the \"adequacy of existing causes,\" and denying\r\nthat the known physical forces ever acted in past time with greater\r\nintensity than they do at present, are, equally of necessity,\r\ndriven to the conclusion that the world is truly in its \"hoary\r\neld,\" and that its present state is really the result of the\r\ntranquil and regulated action of known forces through unnumbered\r\nand innumerable centuries.\r\n\r\nThe most important point for us, in the present connection, is\r\nthe bearing of these opposing doctrines upon the question, as\r\nto the origin of the existing terrestrial order. On any doctrine\r\nof uniformity that order has been evolved slowly, and, according\r\nto law, from a pre-existing order. Any doctrine of catastrophism,\r\non the other hand, carries with it, by implication, the belief\r\nthat the present order of things was brought about suddenly and\r\nirrespective of any pre-existent order; and it is important to\r\nhold clear ideas as to which of these beliefs is the true one. In\r\nthe first place, we may postulate that the world had a beginning,\r\nand, equally, that the existing terrestrial order had a beginning.\r\nHowever far back we may go, geology does not, and cannot, reach the\r\nactual beginning of the world; and we are, therefore, left simply\r\nto our own speculations on this point. With regard, however, to\r\nthe existing terrestrial order, a great deal can be discovered,\r\nand to do so is one of the principal tasks of geological science.\r\nThe first steps in the production of that order lie buried in\r\nthe profound and unsearchable depths of a past so prolonged as\r\nto present itself to our finite minds as almost in eternity.\r\nThe last steps are in the prophetic future, and can be but dimly\r\nguessed at. Between the remote past and the distant future, we\r\nhave, however, a long period which is fairly open to inspection;\r\nand in saying a \"long\" period, it is to be borne in mind that\r\nthis term is used in its _geological_ sense. Within this period,\r\nenormously long as it is when measured by human standards, we\r\ncan trace with reasonable certainty the progressive march of\r\nevents, and can determine the laws of geological action, by which\r\nthe present order of things has been brought about.\r\n\r\nThe natural belief on this subject doubtless is, that the world,\r\nsuch as we now see it, possessed its present form and configuration\r\nfrom the beginning. Nothing can be more natural than the belief\r\nthat the present continents and oceans have always been where\r\nthey are now; that we have always had the same mountains and\r\nplains; that our rivers have always had their present courses,\r\nand our lakes their present positions; that our climate has always\r\nbeen the same; and that our animals and plants have always been\r\nidentical with those now familiar to us. Nothing could be more\r\nnatural than such a belief, and nothing could be further removed\r\nfrom the actual truth. On the contrary, a very slight acquaintance\r\nwith geology shows us, in the words of Sir John Herschel, that\r\n\"the actual configuration of our continents and islands, the\r\ncoast-lines of our maps, the direction and elevation of our\r\nmountain-chains, the courses of our rivers, and the soundings\r\nof our oceans, are not things primordially arranged in the\r\nconstruction of our globe, but results of successive and complex\r\nactions on a former state of things; _that_, again, of similar\r\nactions on another still more remote; and so on, till the original\r\nand really permanent state is pushed altogether out of sight\r\nand beyond the reach even of imagination; while on the other\r\nhand, a similar, and, as far as we can see, interminable vista\r\nis opened out for the future, by which the habitability of our\r\nplanet is secured amid the total abolition on it of the present\r\ntheatres of terrestrial life.\"\r\n\r\nGeology, then, teaches us that the physical features which now\r\ndistinguish the earth's surface have been produced as the ultimate\r\nresult of an almost endless succession of precedent changes.\r\nPalæontology teaches us, though not yet in such assured accents,\r\nthe same lesson. Our present animals and plants have not been\r\nproduced, in their innumerable forms, each as we now know it,\r\nas the sudden, collective, and simultaneous birth of a renovated\r\nworld. On the contrary, we have the clearest evidence that some\r\nof our existing animals and plants made their appearance upon the\r\nearth at a much earlier period than others. In the confederation\r\nof animated nature some races can boast of an immemorial antiquity,\r\nwhilst others are comparative _parvenus_. We have also the clearest\r\nevidence that the animals and plants which now inhabit the globe\r\nhave been preceded, over and over again, by other different\r\nassemblages of animals and plants, which have flourished in\r\nsuccessive periods of the earth's history, have reached their\r\nculmination, and then have given way to a fresh series of living\r\nbeings. We have, finally, the clearest evidence that these successive\r\ngroups of animals and plants (faunæ and floræ) are to a greater\r\nor less extent directly connected with one another. Each group\r\nis, to a greater or less extent, the lineal descendant of the\r\ngroup which immediately preceded it in point of time, and is\r\nmore or less fully concerned with giving origin to the group\r\nwhich immediately follows it. That this law of \"evolution\" has\r\nprevailed to a great extent is quite certain; but it does not\r\nmeet all the exigencies of the case, and it is probable that\r\nits action has been supplemented by some still unknown law of\r\na different character.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to consider the question of geological \"continuity\"\r\nagain. In the meanwhile, it is sufficient to state that this\r\ndoctrine is now almost universally accepted as the basis of all\r\ninquiries, both in the domain of geology and that of palæontology.\r\nThe advocates of continuity possess one immense advantage over\r\nthose who believe in violent and revolutionary convulsions, that\r\nthey call into play only agencies of which we have actual knowledge.\r\nWe _know_ that certain forces are now at work, producing certain\r\nmodifications in the present condition of the globe; and we _know_\r\nthat these forces are capable of producing the vastest of the\r\nchanges which geology brings under our consideration, provided\r\nwe assign a time proportionately vast for their operation. On\r\nthe other hand, the advocates of catastrophism, to make good\r\ntheir views, are compelled to invoke forces and actions, both\r\ndestructive and restorative, of which we have, and can have, no\r\ndirect knowledge. They endow the whirlwind and the earthquake,\r\nthe central fire and the rain from heaven, with powers as mighty\r\nas ever imagined in fable, and they build up the fragments of a\r\nrepeatedly shattered world by the intervention of an intermittently\r\nactive creative power.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that from one point of view\r\nthere is a truth in catastrophism which is sometimes overlooked\r\nby the advocates of continuity and uniformity. Catastrophism\r\nhas, as its essential feature, the proposition that the known\r\nand existing forces of the earth at one time acted with much\r\ngreater intensity and violence than they do at present, and they\r\ncarry down the period of this excessive action to the commencement\r\nof the present terrestrial order. The Uniformitarians, in effect,\r\ndeny this proposition, at any rate as regards any period of the\r\nearth's history of which we have actual cognisance. If, however,\r\nthe \"nebular hypothesis\" of the origin of the universe be well\r\nfounded--as is generally admitted--then, beyond question, the\r\nearth is a gradually cooling body, which has at one time been\r\nvery much hotter than it is at present. There has been a time,\r\ntherefore, in which the igneous forces of the earth, to which we\r\nowe the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes, must have been\r\nfar more intensely active than we can conceive of from anything\r\nthat we can see at the present day. By the same hypothesis, the\r\nsun is a cooling body, and must at one time have possessed a\r\nmuch higher temperature than it has at present. But increased\r\nheat of the sun would seriously alter the existing conditions\r\naffecting the evaporation and precipitation of moisture on our\r\nearth; and hence the aqueous forces may also have acted at one\r\ntime more powerfully than they do now. The fundamental principle\r\nof catastrophism is, therefore, not wholly vicious; and we have\r\nreason to think that there must have been periods--very remote,\r\nit is true, and perhaps unrecorded in the history of the earth--in\r\nwhich the known physical forces may have acted with an intensity\r\nmuch greater than direct observation would lead us to imagine.\r\nAnd this may be believed, altogether irrespective of those great\r\nsecular changes by which hot or cold epochs are produced, and\r\nwhich can hardly be called \"catastrophistic,\" as they are produced\r\ngradually, and are liable to recur at definite intervals.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, then, that there _is_ a truth at the bottom of the once\r\ncurrent doctrines of catastrophism, still it remains certain that\r\nthe history of the earth has been one of _law_ in all past time,\r\nas it is now. Nor need we shrink back affrighted at the vastness\r\nof the conception--the vaster for its very vagueness--that we\r\nare thus compelled to form as to the duration of _geological\r\ntime_. As we grope our way backward through the dark labyrinth\r\nof the ages, epoch succeeds to epoch, and period to period, each\r\nlooming more gigantic in its outlines and more shadowy in its\r\nfeatures, as it rises, dimly revealed, from the mist and vapour\r\nof an older and ever-older past. It is useless to add century\r\nto century or millennium to millennium. When we pass a certain\r\nboundary-line, which, after all, is reached very soon, figures\r\ncease to convey to our finite faculties any real notion of the\r\nperiods with which we have to deal. The astronomer can employ\r\nmaterial illustrations to give form and substance to our conceptions\r\nof celestial space; but such a resource is unavailable to the\r\ngeologist. The few thousand years of which we have historical\r\nevidence sink into absolute insignificance beside the unnumbered\r\næons which unroll themselves one by one as we penetrate the dim\r\nrecesses of the past, and decipher with feeble vision the ponderous\r\nvolumes in which the record of the earth is written. Vainly does\r\nthe strained intellect seek to overtake an ever-receding\r\ncommencement, and toil to gain some adequate grasp of an apparently\r\nendless succession. A beginning there must have been, though we\r\ncan never hope to fix its point. Even speculation droops her\r\nwings in the attenuated atmosphere of a past so remote, and the\r\nlight of imagination is quenched in the darkness of a history so\r\nancient. In _time_, as in _space_, the confines of the universe\r\nmust ever remain concealed from us, and of the end we know no\r\nmore than of the beginning. Inconceivable as is to us the lapse\r\nof \"geological time,\" it is no more than \"a mere moment of the\r\npast, a mere infinitesimal portion of eternity.\" Well may \"the\r\nhuman heart, that weeps and trembles,\" say, with Richter's pilgrim\r\nthrough celestial space, \"I will go no farther; for the spirit of\r\nman acheth with this infinity. Insufferable is the glory of God.\r\nLet me lie down in the grave, and hide me from the persecution\r\nof the Infinite, for end, I see, there is none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOPE AND MATERIALS OF PALÆONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe study of the rock-masses which constitute the crust of the\r\nearth, if carried out in the methodical and scientific manner of\r\nthe geologist, at once brings us, as has been before remarked, in\r\ncontact with the remains or traces of living beings which formerly\r\ndwelt upon the globe. Such remains are found, in greater or less\r\nabundance, in the great majority of rocks; and they are not only of\r\ngreat interest in themselves, but they have proved of the greatest\r\nimportance as throwing light upon various difficult problems in\r\ngeology, in natural history, in botany, and in philosophy. Their\r\nstudy constitutes the science of palæontology; and though it is\r\npossible to proceed to a certain length in geology and zoology\r\nwithout much palæontological knowledge, it is hardly possible to\r\nattain to a satisfactory general acquaintance with either of\r\nthese subjects without having mastered the leading facts of the\r\nfirst. Similarly, it is not possible to study palæontology without\r\nsome acquaintance with both geology and natural history.\r\n\r\nPalæontology, then, is the science which treats of the living\r\nbeings, whether animal or vegetable, which have inhabited the earth\r\nduring past periods of its history. Its object is to elucidate,\r\nas far as may be, the structure, mode of existence, and habits\r\nof all such ancient forms of life; to determine their position\r\nin the scale of organised beings; to lay down the geographical\r\nlimits within which they flourished; and to fix the period of\r\ntheir advent and disappearance. It is the ancient life-history\r\nof the earth; and were its record complete, it would furnish\r\nus with a detailed knowledge of the form and relations of all\r\nthe animals and plants which have at any period flourished upon\r\nthe land-surfaces of the globe or inhabited its waters; it would\r\nenable us to determine precisely their succession in time; and\r\nit would place in our hands an unfailing key to the problems of\r\nevolution. Unfortunately, from causes which will be subsequently\r\ndiscussed, the palæontological record is extremely imperfect,\r\nand our knowledge is interrupted by gaps, which not only bear\r\na large proportion to our solid information, but which in many\r\ncases are of such a nature that we can never hope to fill them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nFossils.--The remains of animals or vegetables which we now find\r\nentombed in the solid rock, and which constitute the working\r\nmaterial of the palæontologist, are termed \"fossils,\"[3] or\r\n\"petrifactions.\" In most cases, as can be readily understood,\r\nfossils are the actual hard parts of animals and plants which\r\nwere in existence when the rock in which they are now found was\r\nbeing deposited. Most fossils, therefore, are of the nature of\r\nthe shells of shell-fish, the skeletons of coral-zoophytes, the\r\nbones of vertebrate animals, or the wood, bark, or leaves of\r\nplants. All such bodies are more or less of a hard consistence\r\nto begin with, and are capable of resisting decay for a longer\r\nor shorter time--hence the frequency with which they occur in\r\nthe fossil condition. Strictly speaking, however, by the term\r\n\"fossil\" must be understood \"any body, _or the traces of the\r\nexistence of any body_, whether animal or vegetable, which has\r\nbeen buried in the earth by natural causes\" (Lyell). We shall\r\nfind, in fact, that many of the objects which we have to study\r\nas \"fossils\" have never themselves actually formed parts of any\r\nanimal or vegetable, though they are due to the former existence\r\nof such organisms, and indicate what was the nature of these.\r\nThus the footprints left by birds, or reptiles, or quadrupeds\r\nupon sand or mud, are just as much proofs of the former existence\r\nof these animals as would be bones, feathers, or scales, though\r\nin themselves they are inorganic. Under the head of fossils,\r\ntherefore, come the footprints of air-breathing vertebrate animals;\r\nthe tracks, trails, and burrows of sea-worms, crustaceans, or\r\nmolluscs; the impressions left on the sand by stranded jelly-fishes;\r\nthe burrows in stone or wood of certain shell-fish; the \"moulds\"\r\nor \"casts\" of shells, corals, and other organic remains; and\r\nvarious other bodies of a more or less similar nature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lat. _fossus_, dug up.]\r\n\r\nFossilisation.-- The term \"fossilisation\" is applied to all those\r\nprocesses through which the remains of organised beings may pass\r\nin being converted into fossils. These processes are numerous\r\nand varied; but there are three principal modes of fossilisation\r\nwhich alone need be considered here. In the first instance, the\r\nfossil is to all intents and purposes an actual portion of the\r\noriginal organised being--such as a bone, a shell, or a piece\r\nof wood. In some rare instances, as in the case of the body of\r\nthe Mammoth discovered embedded in ice at the mouth of the Lena\r\nin Siberia, the fossil may be preserved almost precisely in its\r\noriginal condition, and even with its soft parts uninjured. More\r\ncommonly, certain changes have taken place in the fossil, the\r\nprincipal being the more or less total removal of the organic\r\nmatter originally present. Thus bones become light and porous\r\nby the removal of their gelatine, so as to cleave to the tongue\r\non being applied to that organ; whilst shells become fragile, and\r\nlose their primitive colours. In other cases, though practically\r\nthe real body it represents, all the cavities of the fossil,\r\ndown to its minutest recesses, may have become infiltrated with\r\nmineral matter. It need hardly be added, that it is in the more\r\nmodern rocks that we find the fossils, as a rule, least changed\r\nfrom their former condition; but the original structure is often\r\nmore or less completely retained in some of the fossils from\r\neven the most ancient formations.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we very frequently meet with fossils in the\r\nstate of \"casts\" or moulds of the original organic body. What\r\noccurs in this case will be readily understood if we imagine any\r\ncommon bivalve shell, as an Oyster, or Mussel, or Cockle, embedded\r\nin clay or mud. If the clay were sufficiently soft and fluid, the\r\nfirst thing would be that it would gain access to the interior\r\nof the shell, and would completely fill up the space between the\r\nvalves. The pressure, also, of the surrounding matter would insure\r\nthat the clay would everywhere adhere closely to the exterior of\r\nthe shell. If now we suppose the clay to be in any way hardened\r\nso as to be converted into stone, and if we were to break up the\r\nstone, we should obviously have the following state of parts.\r\nThe clay which filled the shell would form an accurate cast of\r\nthe _interior_ of the shell, and the clay outside would give us\r\nan exact impression or cast of the _exterior_ of the shell (fig.\r\n1). We should have, then, two casts, an interior and an exterior,\r\nand the two would be very different to one another, since the\r\ninside of a shell is very unlike the outside. In the case, in\r\nfact, of many univalve shells, the interior cast or \"mould\" is\r\nso unlike the exterior cast, or unlike the shell itself, that\r\nit may be difficult to determine the true origin of the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--_Trigonia longa_, showing casts to of\r\nthe exterior and interior of the shell.--Cretaceous (Neocomian).]\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that there is sometimes a further\r\ncomplication. If the rock be very porous and permeable by water,\r\nit may happen that the original shell is entirely dissolved away,\r\nleaving the interior cast loose, like the kernel of a nut, within\r\nthe case formed by the exterior cast. Or it may happen that\r\nsubsequent to the attainment of this state of things, the space\r\nthus left vacant between the interior and exterior cast--the space,\r\nthat is, formerly occupied by the shell itself--may be filled up\r\nby some foreign mineral deposited there by the infiltration of\r\nwater. In this last case the splitting open of the rock would\r\nreveal an interior cast, an exterior cast, and finally a body\r\nwhich would have the exact form of the original shell, but which\r\nwould be really a much later formation, and which would not exhibit\r\nunder the microscope the minute structure of shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Microscopic section of the silicified\r\nwood of a Conifer (_Sequoia_) cut in the long direction of the\r\nfibres. Post-tertiary? Colorado. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footnote: Fig. 3.--Microscopic section of the wood\r\nof the common Larch (_Abies larix_), cut in the long direction of\r\nthe fibres. In both the fresh and the fossil wood (fig. 2) are\r\nseen the discs characteristic of coniferous wood. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIn the third class of cases we have fossils which present with\r\nthe greatest accuracy the external form, and even sometimes the\r\ninternal minute structure, of the original organic body, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, are not themselves truly organic, but have\r\nbeen formed by a \"replacement\" of the particles of the primitive\r\norganism by some mineral substance. The most elegant example\r\nof this is afforded by fossil wood which has been \"silicified\"\r\nor converted into flint (_silex_). In such cases we have fossil\r\nwood which presents the rings of growth and fibrous structure of\r\nrecent wood, and which under the microscope exhibits the minutest\r\nvessels which characterise ligneous tissue, together with the even\r\nmore minute markings of the vessels (fig. 2). The whole, however,\r\ninstead of being composed of the original carbonaceous matter of\r\nthe wood, is now converted into flint. The only explanation that\r\ncan be given of this by no means rare phenomenon, is that the\r\nwood must have undergone a slow process of decay in water charged\r\nwith silica or flint in solution. As each successive particle of\r\nwood was removed by decay, its place was taken by a particle of\r\nflint deposited from the surrounding water, till ultimately the\r\nentire wood was silicified. The process, therefore, resembles\r\nwhat would take place if we were to pull down a house built of\r\nbrick by successive bricks, replacing each brick as removed by\r\na piece of stone of precisely the same size and form. The result\r\nof this would be that the house would retain its primitive size,\r\nshape, and outline, but it would finally have been converted\r\nfrom a house of brick into a house of stone. Many other fossils\r\nbesides wood--such as shells, corals, sponges, &c.--are often\r\nfound silicified; and this may be regarded as the commonest form\r\nof fossilisation by replacement. In other cases, however, though\r\nthe principle of the process is the same, the replacing substance\r\nmay be iron pyrites, oxide of iron, sulphur, malachite, magnesite,\r\ntalc, &c.; but it is rarely that the replacement with these minerals\r\nis so perfect as to preserve the more delicate details of internal\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nFossils are found in rocks, though not universally or promiscuously;\r\nand it is therefore necessary that the palæontologist should\r\npossess some acquaintance with, at any rate, those rocks which\r\nyield organic remains, and which are therefore said to be\r\n\"_fossiliferous_.\" In geological language, all the materials\r\nwhich enter into the composition of the solid crust of the earth,\r\nbe their texture what it may--from the most impalpable mud to\r\nthe hardest granite--are termed \"rocks;\" and for our present\r\npurpose we may divide these into two great groups. In the first\r\ndivision are the _Igneous Rocks_--such as the lavas and ashes of\r\nvolcanoes--which are formed within the body of the earth itself,\r\nand which owe their structure and origin to the action of heat.\r\nThe Igneous Rocks are formed primarily below the surface of the\r\nearth, which they only reach as the result of volcanic action;\r\nthey are generally destitute of distinct \"stratification,\" or\r\narrangement in successive layers; and they do not contain fossils,\r\nexcept in the comparatively rare instances where volcanic ashes\r\nhave enveloped animals or plants which were living in the sea\r\nor on the land in the immediate vicinity of the volcanic focus.\r\nThe second great division of rocks is that of the _Fossiliferous,\r\nAqueous_, or _Sedimentary_ Rocks. These are formed at the surface\r\nof the earth, and, as implied by one of their names, are invariably\r\ndeposited in water. They are produced by vital or chemical action,\r\nor are formed from the \"sediment\" produced by the disintegration\r\nand reconstruction of previously existing rocks, without previous\r\nsolution; they mostly contain fossils; and they are arranged\r\nin distinct layers or \"strata.\" The so-called \"aerial\" rocks\r\nwhich, like beds of blown sand, have been formed by the action\r\nof the atmosphere, may also contain fossils; but they are not\r\nof such importance as to require special notice here.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes, we may consider that the Aqueous\r\nRocks are the natural cemetery of the animals and plants of bygone\r\nages; and it is therefore essential that the palæontological\r\nstudent should be acquainted with some of the principal facts as\r\nto their physical characters, their minute structure and mode of\r\norigin, their chief varieties, and their historical succession.\r\n\r\nThe Sedimentary or Fossiliferous Rocks form the greater portion of\r\nthat part of the earth's crust which is open to our examination, and\r\nare distinguished by the fact that they are regularly \"stratified\" or\r\narranged in distinct and definite layers or \"strata.\" These layers\r\nmay consist of a single material, as in a block of sandstone, or\r\nthey may consist of different materials. When examined on a large\r\nscale, they are always found to consist of alternations of layers\r\nof different mineral composition. We may examine any given area,\r\nand find in it nothing but one kind of rock--sandstone, perhaps,\r\nor limestone. In all cases, however, if we extend our examination\r\nsufficiently far, we shall ultimately come upon different rocks;\r\nand, as a general rule, the thickness of any particular set of\r\nbeds is comparatively small, so that different kinds of rock\r\nalternate with one another in comparatively small spaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Sketch of Carboniferous strata at Kinghorn,\r\nin Fife, showing stratified beds (limestone and shales) surmounted\r\nby an unstratified mass of trap. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nAs regards the origin of the Sedimentary Rocks, they are for\r\nthe most part \"derivative\" rocks, being derived from the wear\r\nand tear of pre-existent rocks. Sometimes, however, they owe\r\ntheir origin to chemical or vital action, when they would more\r\nproperly be spoken of simply as Aqueous Rocks. As to their mode\r\nof deposition, we are enabled to infer that the materials which\r\ncompose them have formerly been spread out by the action of water,\r\nfrom what we see going on every day at the mouths of our great\r\nrivers, and on a smaller scale wherever there is running water.\r\nEvery stream, where it runs into a lake or into the sea, carries\r\nwith it a burden of mud, sand, and rounded pebbles, derived from\r\nthe waste of the rocks which form its bed and banks. When these\r\nmaterials cease to be impelled by the force of the moving water,\r\nthey sink to the bottom, the heaviest pebbles, of course, sinking\r\nfirst, the smaller pebbles and sand next, and the finest mud\r\nlast. Ultimately, therefore, as might have been inferred upon\r\ntheoretical grounds, and as is proved by practical experience,\r\nevery lake becomes a receptacle for a series of stratified rocks\r\nproduced by the streams flowing into it. These deposits may vary\r\nin different parts of the lake, according as one stream brought\r\ndown one kind of material and another stream contributed another\r\nmaterial; but in all cases the materials will bear ample evidence\r\nthat they were produced, sorted, and deposited by running water.\r\nThe finer beds of clay or sand will all be arranged in thicker or\r\nthinner layers or laminæ; and if there are any beds of pebbles\r\nthese will all be rounded or smooth, just like the water-worn\r\npebbles of any brook-course. In all probability, also, we should\r\nfind in some of the beds the remains of fresh-water shells or\r\nplants or other organisms which inhabited the lake at the time\r\nthese beds were being deposited.\r\n\r\nIn the same way large rivers--such as the Ganges or\r\nMississippi--deposit all the materials which they bring down\r\nat their mouths, forming in this way their \"deltas.\" Whenever\r\nsuch a delta is cut through, either by man or by some channel of\r\nthe river altering its course, we find that it is composed of a\r\nsuccession of horizontal layers or strata of sand or mud, varying\r\nin mineral composition, in structure, or in grain, according to\r\nthe nature of the materials brought down by the river at different\r\nperiods. Such deltas, also, will contain the remains of animals\r\nwhich inhabit the river, with fragments of the plants which grew\r\non its banks, or bones of the animals which lived in its basin.\r\n\r\nNor is this action confined, of course, to large rivers only,\r\nthough naturally most conspicuous in the greatest bodies of water.\r\nOn the contrary, all streams, of whatever size, are engaged in\r\nthe work of wearing down the dry land, and of transporting the\r\nmaterials thus derived from higher to lower levels, never resting\r\nin this work till they reach the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Diagram to illustrate the formation of\r\nsedimentary deposits at the point where a river debouches into\r\nthe sea.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the sea itself--irrespective of the materials delivered\r\ninto it by rivers--is constantly preparing fresh stratified deposits\r\nby its own action. Upon every coast-line the sea is constantly\r\neating back into the land and reducing its component rocks to\r\nform the shingle and sand which we see upon every shore. The\r\nmaterials thus produced are not, however, lost, but are ultimately\r\ndeposited elsewhere in the form of new stratified accumulations,\r\nin which are buried the remains of animals inhabiting the sea\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nWhenever, then, we find anywhere in the interior of the land\r\nany series of beds having these characters--composed, that is,\r\nof distinct layers, the particles of which, both large and small,\r\nshow distinct traces of the wearing action of water--whenever and\r\nwherever we find such rocks, we are justified in assuming that\r\nthey have been deposited by water in the manner above mentioned.\r\nEither they were laid down in some former lake by the combined\r\naction of the streams which flowed into it; or they were deposited\r\nat the mouth of some ancient river, forming its delta; or they\r\nwere laid down at the bottom of the ocean. In the first two cases,\r\nany fossils which the beds might contain would be the remains\r\nof fresh-water or terrestrial organisms. In the last case, the\r\nmajority, at any rate, of the fossils would be the remains of\r\nmarine animals.\r\n\r\nThe term \"formation\" is employed by geologists to express \"any\r\ngroup of rocks which have some character in common, whether of\r\norigin, age, or composition\" (Lyell); so that we may speak of\r\nstratified and unstratified formations, aqueous or igneous\r\nformations, fresh-water or marine formations, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF DIVISIONS OF THE AQUEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueous Rocks may be divided into two great sections, the\r\nMechanically-formed and the Chemically-formed, including under\r\nthe last head all rocks which owe their origin to vital action,\r\nas well as those produced by ordinary chemical agencies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Microscopic section of a calcareous breccia\r\nin the Lower Silurian (Coniston Limestone) of Shap Wells,\r\nWestmoreland. The fragments are all of small size, and consist of\r\nangular pieces of transparent quartz, volcanic ashes, and limestone\r\nembedded in a matrix of crystalline limestone. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nA. MECHANICALLY-FORMED ROCKS.--These are all those Aqueous Rocks\r\nof which we can obtain proofs that their particles have been\r\nmechanically transported to their present situation. Thus, if\r\nwe examine a piece of _conglomerate_ or puddingstone, we find\r\nit to be composed of a number of rounded pebbles embedded in an\r\nenveloping matrix or paste, which is usually of a sandy nature,\r\nbut may be composed of carbonate of lime (when the rock is said to\r\nbe a \"calcareous conglomerate\"). The pebbles in all conglomerates\r\nare worn and rounded by the action of water in motion, and thus\r\nshow that they have been subjected to much mechanical attrition,\r\nwhilst they have been mechanically transported for a greater\r\nor less distance from the rock of which they originally formed\r\npart. The analogue of the old conglomerates at the present day\r\nis to be found in the great beds of shingle and gravel which\r\nare formed by the action of the sea on every coast-line, and\r\nwhich are composed of water-worn and well-rounded pebbles of\r\ndifferent sizes. A _breccia_ is a mechanically-formed rock, very\r\nsimilar to a conglomerate, and consisting of larger or smaller\r\nfragments of rock embedded in a common matrix. The fragments,\r\nhowever, are in this case all more or less angular, and are not\r\nworn or rounded. The fragments in breccias may be of large size,\r\nor they may be comparatively small (fig. 6); and the matrix may\r\nbe composed of sand (arenaceous) or of carbonate of lime\r\n(calcareous). In the case of an ordinary sandstone, again, we\r\nhave a rock which may be regarded as simply a very fine-grained\r\nconglomerate or breccia, being composed of small grains of sand\r\n(silica), sometimes rounded, sometimes more or less angular,\r\ncemented together by some such substance as oxide of iron, silicate\r\nof iron, or carbonate of lime. A sandstone, therefore, like a\r\nconglomerate is a mechanically-formed rock, its component grams\r\nbeing equally the result of mechanical attrition and having equally\r\nbeen transported from a distance; and the same is true of the\r\nordinary sand of the sea-shore, which is nothing more than an\r\nunconsolidated sandstone. Other so-called sands and sandstones,\r\nthough equally mechanical in their origin, are truly calcareous in\r\ntheir nature, and are more or less entirely composed of carbonate\r\nof lime. Of this kind are the shell-sand so common on our coasts,\r\nand the coral-sand which is so largely formed in the neighbourhood\r\nof coral-reefs. In these cases the rock is composed of fragments\r\nof the skeletons of shellfish, and numerous other marine animals,\r\ntogether, in many instances, with the remains of certain sea-weeds\r\n(_Corallines_, _Nullipores_, &c,) which are endowed with the\r\npower of secreting carbonate of lime from the sea-water. Lastly,\r\nin certain rocks still finer in their texture than sandstones,\r\nsuch as the various mud-rocks and shales, we can still recognise\r\na mechanical source and origin. If slices of any of these rocks\r\nsufficiently thin to be transparent are examined under the\r\nmicroscope, it will be found that they are composed of minute\r\ngrains of different sizes, which are all more or less worn and\r\nrounded, and which clearly show, therefore, that they have been\r\nsubjected to mechanical attrition.\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned rocks, then, are _mechanically-formed_\r\nrocks; and they are often spoken of as \"Derivative Rocks,\" in\r\nconsequence of the fact that their particles can be shown to\r\nhave been mechanically _derived_ from other pre-existent rocks.\r\nIt follows from this that every bed of any mechanically-formed\r\nrock is the measure and equivalent of a corresponding amount of\r\ndestruction of some older rock. It is not necessary to enter\r\nhere into a minute account of the subdivisions of these rocks, but\r\nit may be mentioned that they may be divided into two principal\r\ngroups, according to their chemical composition. In the one group\r\nwe have the so-called _Arenaceous_ (Lat. _arena_, sand) or\r\n_Siliceous_ Rocks, which are essentially composed of larger or\r\nsmaller grains of flint or silica. In this group are comprised\r\nordinary sand, the varieties of sandstone and grit, and most\r\nconglomerates and breccias. We shall, however, afterwards see\r\nthat some siliceous rocks are of organic origin. In the second\r\ngroup are the so-called _Argillaceous_ (Lat. _argilla_, clay)\r\nRocks, which contain a larger or smaller amount of clay or hydrated\r\nsilicate of alumina in their composition. Under this head come\r\nclays, shales, marls, marl-slate, clay-slates, and most flags\r\nand flagstones.\r\n\r\nB. CHEMICALLY-FORMED ROCKS.--In this section are comprised all\r\nthose Aqueous or Sedimentary Rocks which have been formed by\r\nchemical agencies. As many of these chemical agencies, however,\r\nare exerted through the medium of living beings, whether animals\r\nor plants, we get into this section a number of what may be called\r\n\"_organically-formed rocks_.\" These are of the greatest possible\r\nimportance to the palæontologist, as being to a greater or less\r\nextent composed of the actual remains of animals or vegetables,\r\nand it will therefore be necessary to consider their character\r\nand structure in some detail.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of the chemically-formed rocks are\r\nthe so-called _Calcareous Rocks_ (Lat. _calx_, lime), comprising\r\nall those which contain a large proportion of carbonate of lime,\r\nor are wholly composed of this substance. Carbonate of lime is\r\nsoluble in water holding a certain amount of carbonic acid gas\r\nin solution; and it is, therefore, found in larger or smaller\r\nquantity dissolved in all natural waters, both fresh and salt,\r\nsince these waters are always to some extent charged with the\r\nabove-mentioned solvent gas. A great number of aquatic animals,\r\nhowever, together with some aquatic plants, are endowed with\r\nthe power of separating the lime thus held in solution in the\r\nwater, and of reducing it again to its solid condition. In this\r\nway shell-fish, crustaceans, sea-urchins, corals, and an immense\r\nnumber of other animals, are enabled to construct their skeletons;\r\nwhilst some plants form hard structures within their tissues\r\nin a precisely similar manner. We do meet with some calcareous\r\ndeposits, such as the \"stalactites\" and \"stalagmites\" of caves,\r\nthe \"calcareous tufa\" and \"travertine\" of some hot springs, and\r\nthe spongy calcareous deposits of so-called \"petrifying springs,\"\r\nwhich are purely chemical in their origin, and owe nothing to the\r\noperation of living beings. Such deposits are formed simply by\r\nthe precipitation of carbonate of lime from water, in consequence\r\nof the evaporation from the water of the carbonic acid gas which\r\nformerly held the lime in solution; but, though sometimes forming\r\nmasses of considerable thickness and of geological importance,\r\nthey do not concern us here. Almost all the limestones which\r\noccur in the series of the stratified rocks are, primarily at any\r\nrate, of _organic_ origin, and have been, directly or indirectly,\r\nproduced by the action of certain lime-making animals or plants,\r\nor both combined. The presumption as to all the calcareous rocks,\r\nwhich cannot be clearly shown to have been otherwise produced,\r\nis that they are thus organically formed; and in many cases this\r\npresumption can be readily reduced to a certainty. There are\r\nmany varieties of the calcareous rocks, but the following are\r\nthose which are of the greatest importance:--\r\n\r\n_Chalk_ is a calcareous rock of a generally soft and pulverulent\r\ntexture, and with an earthy fracture. It varies in its purity,\r\nbeing sometimes almost wholly composed of carbonate of lime,\r\nand at other times more or less intermixed with foreign matter.\r\nThough usually soft and readily reducible to powder, chalk is\r\noccasionally, as in the north of Ireland, tolerably hard and\r\ncompact; but it never assumes the crystalline aspect and stony\r\ndensity of limestone, except it be in immediate contact with\r\nsome mass of igneous rock. By means of the microscope, the true\r\nnature and mode of formation of chalk can be determined with\r\nthe greatest ease. In the case of the harder varieties, the\r\nexamination can be conducted by means of slices ground down to\r\na thinness sufficient to render them transparent; but in the\r\nsofter kinds the rock must be disintegrated under water, and the\r\n_débris_ examined microscopically. When investigated by either\r\nof these methods, chalk is found to be a genuine organic rock,\r\nbeing composed of the shells or hard parts of innumerable marine\r\nanimals of different kinds, some entire, some fragmentary, cemented\r\ntogether by a matrix of very finely granular carbonate of lime.\r\nForemost amongst the animal remains which so largely compose\r\nchalk are the shells of the minute creatures which will be\r\nsubsequently spoken of under the name of _Foraminifera_ (fig.\r\n7), and which, in spite of their microscopic dimensions, play a\r\nmore important part in the process of lime-making than perhaps\r\nany other of the larger inhabitants of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Section of Gravesend Chalk, examined\r\nby transmitted light and highly magnified. Besides the entire\r\nshells of _Globigerina_, _Rotalia_, and _Textularia_, numerous\r\ndetached chambers of _Globigerina_ are seen. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nAs chalk is found in beds of hundreds of feet in thickness,\r\nand of great purity, there was long felt much difficulty\r\nin satisfactorily accounting for its mode of formation and origin.\r\nBy the researches of Carpenter, Wyville Thomson,\r\nHuxley, Wallich, and others, it has, however, been shown\r\nthat there is now forming, in the profound depths of our\r\ngreat oceans, a deposit which is in all essential respects\r\nidentical with chalk, and which is\r\ngenerally known as the \"Atlantic ooze,\" from its having been\r\nfirst discovered in that sea. This ooze is found at great\r\ndepths (5000 to over 15,000 feet) in both the Atlantic and\r\nPacific, covering enormously large areas of the sea-bottom,\r\nand it presents itself as a whitish-brown, sticky, impalpable mud,\r\nvery like greyish chalk when dried. Chemical examination\r\nshows that the ooze is composed almost wholly of carbonate of\r\nlime, and microscopical examination proves it to be of organic\r\norigin, and to be made up of the remains of living beings.\r\nThe principal forms of these belong to the _Foraminifera_, and\r\nthe commonest of these are the irregularly-chambered shells of\r\n_Globigerina_, absolutely indistinguishable from the\r\n_Globigerinoe_ which are so largely present in the chalk (fig. 8).\r\nAlong with these occur fragments of the skeletons of other larger\r\ncreatures, and a certain proportion of the flinty cases of minute\r\nanimal and vegetable organisms (_Polycystina_ and _Diatoms_).\r\nThough many of the minute animals, the hard parts of which form\r\nthe ooze, undoubtedly live at or near the surface of the sea,\r\nothers, probably, really live near the bottom; and the ooze\r\nitself forms a congenial home for numerous sponges, sea-lilies,\r\nand other marine animals which flourish at great\r\ndepths in the sea. There is thus established an intimate\r\nand most interesting parallelism between the chalk and\r\nthe ooze of modern oceans.  Both are formed essentially in\r\nthe same way, and the latter only requires consolidation to\r\nbecome actually converted into chalk. Both are fundamentally\r\norganic deposits, apparently requiring a great depth of water\r\nfor their accumulation, and mainly composed of the remains of\r\n_Foraminifera_, together with the entire or broken skeletons\r\nof other marine animals of greater dimensions. It is to be\r\nremembered, however, that the ooze, though strictly\r\nrepresentative of the chalk, cannot be said in any proper sense\r\nto be actually _identical_ with the formation so called by\r\ngeologists. A great lapse of time separates the two, and though\r\ncomposed of the remains of representative classes or groups of\r\nanimals, it is only in the case of the lowly-organised\r\n_Globigerinoe_, and of some other organisms of little higher\r\ngrade, that we find absolutely the same kinds or species of\r\nanimals in both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Organisms in the Atlantic Ooze, chiefly\r\n_Foraminifera_ (_Globigerina_ and _Textularia_), with _Polycystina_\r\nand sponge-spicules; highly magnified. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Slab of Crinoidal marble, from the\r\nCarboniferous limestone of Dent, in Yorkshire, of the natural\r\nsize. The polished surface intersects the columns of the Crinoids\r\nat different angles, and thus gives rise to varying appearances.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n_Limestone_, like chalk, is composed of carbonate of lime, sometimes\r\nalmost pure, but more commonly with a greater or less intermixture\r\nof some foreign material, such as alumina or silica. The varieties\r\nof limestone are almost innumerable, but the great majority can\r\nbe clearly proved to agree with chalk in being essentially of\r\norganic origin, and in being more or less largely composed of the\r\nremains of living beings. In many instances the organic remains\r\nwhich compose limestone are so large as to be readily visible to\r\nthe naked eye, and the rock is at once seen to be nothing more\r\nthan an agglomeration of the skeletons, generally fragmentary, of\r\ncertain marine animals, cemented together by a matrix of carbonate\r\nof lime. This is the case, for example, with the so-called \"Crinoidal\r\nLimestones\" and \"Encrinital Marbles\" with which the geologist\r\nis so familiar, especially as occurring in great beds amongst\r\nthe older formations of the earth's crust. These are seen, on\r\nweathered or broken surfaces, or still better in polished slabs\r\n(fig. 9), to be composed more or less exclusively of the broken\r\nstems and detached plates of sea-lilies (_Crinoids_). Similarly,\r\nother limestones are composed almost entirely of the skeletons of\r\ncorals; and such old coralline limestones can readily be paralleled\r\nby formations which we can find in actual course of production\r\nat the present day. We only need to transport ourselves to the\r\nislands of the Pacific, to the West Indies, or to the Indian\r\nOcean, to find great masses of lime formed similarly by living\r\ncorals, and well known to everyone under the name of \"coral-reefs.\"\r\nSuch reefs are often of vast extent, both superficially and in\r\nvertical thickness, and they fully equal in this respect any of\r\nthe coralline limestones of bygone ages. Again, we find other\r\nlimestones--such as the celebrated \"Nummulitic Limestone\" (fig. 10),\r\nwhich sometimes attains a thickness of some thousands of feet--which\r\nare almost entirely made up of the shells of _Foraminifera_. In\r\nthe case of the \"Nummulitic Limestone,\" just mentioned, these\r\nshells are of large size, varying from the size of a split pea\r\nup to that of a florin. There are, however, as we shall see,\r\nmany other limestones, which are likewise largely made up of\r\n_Foraminifera_, but in which the shells are very much more minute,\r\nand would hardly be seen at all without the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Piece of Nummulitic Limestone from the\r\nGreat Pyramid. Of the natural size. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nWe may, in fact, consider that the great agents in the production\r\nof limestones in past ages have been animals belonging to the\r\n_Crinoids_, the _Corals_, and the _Foraminifera_. At the present\r\nday, the Crinoids have been nearly extinguished, and the few known\r\nsurvivors seem to have retired to great depths in the ocean; but\r\nthe two latter still actively carry on the work of lime-making,\r\nthe former being very largely helped in their operations by certain\r\nlime-producing marine plants (_Nullipores_ and _Corallines_). We\r\nhave to remember, however, that though the limestones, both ancient\r\nand modern, that we have just spoken of, are truly organic, they\r\nare not necessarily formed out of the remains of animals which\r\nactually lived on the precise spot where we now find the limestone\r\nitself. We may find a crinoidal limestone, which we can show to\r\nhave been actually formed by the successive growth of generations\r\nof sea-lilies _in place_; but we shall find many others in which\r\nthe rock is made up of innumerable fragments of the skeletons\r\nof these creatures, which have been clearly worn and rubbed by\r\nthe sea-waves, and which have been mechanically transported to\r\ntheir present site. In the same way, a limestone may be shown\r\nto have been an actual coral-reef, by the fact that we find in\r\nit great masses of coral, growing in their natural position,\r\nand exhibiting plain proofs that they were simply quietly buried\r\nby the calcareous sediment as they grew; but other limestones\r\nmay contain only numerous rolled and water-worn fragments of\r\ncorals. This is precisely paralleled by what we can observe in\r\nour existing coral-reefs. Parts of the modern coral-islands and\r\ncoral-reefs are really made up of corals, dead or alive, which\r\nactually grew on the spot where we now find them; but other parts\r\nare composed of a limestone-rock (\"coral-rock\"), or of a loose\r\nsand (\"coral-sand\"), which is organic in the sense that it is\r\ncomposed of lime formed by living beings, but which, in truth,\r\nis composed of fragments of the skeletons of these living beings,\r\nmechanically transported and heaped together by the sea. To take\r\nanother example nearer home, we may find great accumulations of\r\ncalcareous matter formed _in place_, by the growth of shell-fish,\r\nsuch as oysters or mussels; but we can also find equally great\r\naccumulations on many of our shores in the form of \"shell-sand,\"\r\nwhich is equally composed of the shells of molluscs, but which is\r\nformed by the trituration of these shells by the mechanical power\r\nof the sea-waves. We thus see that though all these limestones are\r\nprimarily organic, they not uncommonly become \"mechanically-formed\"\r\nrocks in a secondary sense, the materials of which they are composed\r\nbeing formed by living beings, but having been mechanically\r\ntransported to the place where we now find them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Section of Carboniferous Limestone from\r\nSpergen Hill, Indiana, U.S., showing numerous large-sized\r\n_Foraminifera_ (_Endothyra_) and a few oolitic grains; magnified.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 12.--Section of Coniston Limestone (Lower\r\nSilurian) from Keisler, Westmoreland; magnified. The matrix is\r\nvery coarsely crystalline, and the included organic remains are\r\nchiefly stems of Crinoids. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nMany limestones, as we have seen, are composed of large and\r\nconspicuous organic remains, such as strike the eye at once.\r\nMany others, however, which at first sight appear compact, more\r\nor less crystalline, and nearly devoid of traces of life, are\r\nfound, when properly examined, to be also composed of the remains\r\nof various organisms. All the commoner limestones, in fact, from\r\nthe Lower Silurian period onwards, can be easily proved to be\r\nthus _organic_ rocks, if we investigate weathered or polished\r\nsurfaces with a lens, or, still better, if we cut thin slices\r\nof the rock and grind these down till they are transparent. When\r\nthus examined, the rock is usually found to be composed of\r\ninnumerable entire or fragmentary fossils, cemented together\r\nby a granular or crystalline matrix of carbonate of lime (figs.\r\n11 and 12). When the matrix is granular, the rock is precisely\r\nsimilar to chalk, except that it is harder and less earthy in\r\ntexture, whilst the fossils are only occasionally referable to\r\nthe _Foraminifera_. In other cases, the matrix is more or less\r\ncrystalline, and when this crystallisation has been carried to\r\na great extent, the original organic nature of the rock may be\r\ngreatly or completely obscured thereby. Thus, in limestones which\r\nhave been greatly altered or \"metamorphosed\" by the combined\r\naction of heat and pressure, all traces of organic remains become\r\nannihilated, and the rock becomes completely crystalline throughout.\r\nThis, for example, is the case with the ordinary white \"statuary\r\nmarble,\" slices of which exhibit under the microscope nothing but\r\nan aggregate of beautifully transparent crystals of carbonate\r\nof lime, without the smallest traces of fossils. There are also\r\nother cases, where the limestone is not necessarily highly\r\ncrystalline, and where no metamorphic action in the strict sense\r\nhas taken place, in which, nevertheless, the microscope fails\r\nto reveal any evidence that the rock is organic. Such cases are\r\nsomewhat obscure, and doubtless depend on different causes in\r\ndifferent instances; but they do not affect the important\r\ngeneralisation that limestones are fundamentally the product\r\nof the operation of living beings. This fact remains certain;\r\nand when we consider the vast superficial extent occupied by\r\ncalcareous deposits, and the enormous collective thickness of\r\nthese, the mind cannot fail to be impressed with the immensity of\r\nthe period demanded for the formation of these by the agency of\r\nsuch humble and often microscopic creatures as Corals, Sea-lilies,\r\nForaminifers, and Shell-fish.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous varieties of limestone, a few are of such\r\ninterest as to deserve a brief notice. _Magnesian limestone_\r\nor _dolomite_, differs from ordinary limestone in containing\r\na certain proportion of carbonate of magnesia along with the\r\ncarbonate of lime. The typical dolomites contain a large proportion\r\nof carbonate of magnesia, and are highly crystalline. The ordinary\r\nmagnesian limestones (such as those of Durham in the Permian\r\nseries, and the Guelph Limestones of North America in the Silurian\r\nseries) are generally of a yellowish, buff, or brown colour,\r\nwith a crystalline or pearly aspect, effervescing with acid much\r\nless freely than ordinary limestone, exhibiting numerous cavities\r\nfrom which fossils have been dissolved out, and often assuming\r\nthe most varied and singular forms in consequence of what is\r\ncalled \"concretionary action.\" Examination with the microscope\r\nshows that these limestones are composed of an aggregate of minute\r\nbut perfectly distinct crystals, but that minute organisms of\r\ndifferent kinds, or fragments of larger fossils, are often present\r\nas well. Other magnesian limestones, again, exhibit no striking\r\nexternal peculiarities by which the presence of magnesia would be\r\nreadily recognised, and though the base of the rock is crystalline,\r\nthey are replete with the remains of organised beings. Thus many\r\nof the magnesian limestones of the Carboniferous series of the\r\nNorth of England are very like ordinary limestone to look at,\r\nthough effervescing less freely with acids, and the microscope\r\nproves them to be charged with the remains of _Foraminifera_\r\nand other minute organisms.\r\n\r\n_Marbles_ are of various kinds, all limestones which are sufficiently\r\nhard and compact to take a high polish going by this name. Statuary\r\nmarble, and most of the celebrated foreign marbles, are \"metamorphic\"\r\nrocks, of a highly crystalline nature, and having all traces\r\nof their primitive organic structure obliterated. Many other\r\nmarbles, however, differ from ordinary limestone simply in the\r\nmatter of density. Thus, many marbles (such as Derbyshire marble)\r\nare simply \"crinoidal limestones\" (fig. 9); whilst various other\r\nBritish marbles exhibit innumerable organic remains under the\r\nmicroscope. Black marbles owe their colour to the presence of\r\nvery minute particles of carbonaceous matter, in some cases at\r\nany rate; and they may either be metamorphic, or they may be\r\ncharged with minute fossils such as _Foraminifera_ (_e.g._, the\r\nblack limestones of Ireland, and the black marble of Dent, in\r\nYorkshire).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Slice of oolitic limestone from the\r\nJurassic series (Coral Rag) of Weymouth; magnified. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n\"_Oolitic_\" _limestones_, or \"_oolites_,\" as they are often called,\r\nare of interest both to the palæontologist and geologist. The\r\npeculiar structure to which they owe their name is that the rock\r\nis more or less entirely composed of spheroidal or oval grains,\r\nwhich vary in size from the head of a small pin or less up to\r\nthe size of a pea, and which may be in almost immediate contact\r\nwith one another, or may be cemented together by a more or less\r\nabundant calcareous matrix. When the grains are pretty nearly\r\nspherical and are in tolerably close contact, the rock looks very\r\nlike the roe of a fish, and the name of \"oolite\" or \"egg-stone\"\r\nis in allusion to this. When the grains are of the size of peas\r\nor upwards, the rock is often called a \"pisolite\" (Lat. _pisum_,\r\na pea). Limestones having this peculiar structure are especially\r\nabundant in the Jurassic formation, which is often called the\r\n\"Oolitic series\" for this reason; but essentially similar limestones\r\noccur not uncommonly in the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous\r\nformations, and, indeed, in almost all rock-groups in which\r\nlimestones are largely developed. Whatever may be the age of\r\nthe formation in which they occur, and whatever may be the size\r\nof their component \"eggs,\" the structure of oolitic limestones\r\nis fundamentally the same. All the ordinary oolitic limestones,\r\nnamely, consist of little spherical or ovoid \"concretions,\" as\r\nthey are termed, cemented together by a larger or smaller amount\r\nof crystalline carbonate of lime, together, in many instances,\r\nwith numerous organic remains of different kinds (fig. 13). When\r\nexamined in polished slabs, or in thin sections prepared for the\r\nmicroscope, each of these little concretions is seen to consist\r\nof numerous concentric coats of carbonate of lime, which sometimes\r\nsimply surround an imaginary centre, but which, more commonly,\r\nhave been successively deposited round some foreign body, such as\r\na little crystal of quartz, a cluster of sand-grains, or a minute\r\nshell. In other cases, as in some of the beds of the Carboniferous\r\nlimestone in the North of England, where the limestone is highly\r\n\"arenaceous,\" there is a modification of the oolitic structure.\r\nMicroscopic sections of these sandy limestones (fig. 14) show\r\nnumerous generally angular or oval grains of silica or flint,\r\neach of which is commonly surrounded by a thin coating of carbonate\r\nof lime, or sometimes by several such coats, the whole being\r\ncemented together along with the shells of _Foraminifera_ and\r\nother minute fossils by a matrix of crystalline calcite. As compared\r\nwith typical oolites, the concretions in these limestones are\r\nusually much more irregular in shape, often lengthened out and\r\nalmost cylindrical, at other times angular, the central nucleus\r\nbeing of large size, and the surrounding envelope of lime being\r\nvery thin, and often exhibiting no concentric structure. In both\r\nthese and the ordinary oolites, the structure is fundamentally\r\nthe same. Both have been formed in a sea, probably of no great\r\ndepth, the waters of which were charged with carbonate of lime\r\nin solution, whilst the bottom was formed of sand intermixed with\r\nminute shells and fragments of the skeletons of larger marine\r\nanimals. The excess of lime in the sea-water was precipitated\r\nround the sand-grams, or round the smaller shells, as so many\r\nnuclei, and this precipitation must often have taken place time\r\nafter time, so as to give rise to the concentric structure so\r\ncharacteristic of oolitic concretions. Finally, the oolitic grains\r\nthus produced were cemented together by a further precipitation\r\nof crystalline carbonate of lime from the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Slice of arenaceous and oolitic limestone\r\nfrom the Carboniferous series of Shap, Westmoreland; magnified.\r\nThe section also exhibit _Foraminifera_ and other minute fossils.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n_Phosphate of Lime_ is another lime-salt, which is of interest to\r\nthe palæontologist. It does not occur largely in the stratified\r\nseries, but it is found in considerable beds [4] in the Laurentian\r\nformation, and less abundantly in some later rock-groups, whilst\r\nit occurs abundantly in the form of nodules in parts of the\r\nCretaceous (Upper Greensand) and Tertiary deposits. Phosphate\r\nof lime forms the larger proportion of the earthy matters of the\r\nbones of Vertebrate animals, and also occurs in less amount in the\r\nskeletons of certain of the Invertebrates (_e.g._, _Crustacea_). It\r\nis, indeed, perhaps more distinctively than carbonate of lime, an\r\norganic compound; and though the formation of many known deposits\r\nof phosphate of lime cannot be positively shown to be connected\r\nwith the previous operation of living beings, there is room for\r\ndoubt whether this salt is not in reality always primarily a\r\nproduct of vital action. The phosphatic nodules of the Upper\r\nGreensand are erroneously called \"coprolites,\" from the belief\r\noriginally entertained that they were the droppings or fossilised\r\nexcrements of extinct animals; and though this is not the case,\r\nthere can be little doubt but that the phosphate of lime which\r\nthey contain is in this instance of organic origin.[5] It appears,\r\nin fact, that decaying animal matter has a singular power of\r\ndetermining the precipitation around it of mineral salts dissolved\r\nin water. Thus, when any animal bodies are undergoing decay at the\r\nbottom of the sea, they have a tendency to cause the precipitation\r\nfrom the surrounding water of any mineral matters which may be\r\ndissolved in it; and the organic body thus becomes a centre round\r\nwhich the mineral matters in question are deposited in the form\r\nof a \"concretion\" or \"nodule.\" The phosphatic nodules in question\r\nwere formed in a sea in which phosphate of lime, derived from the\r\ndestruction of animal skeletons, was held largely in solution;\r\nand a precipitation of it took place round any body, such as a\r\ndecaying animal substance, which happened to be lying on the\r\nsea-bottom, and which offered itself as a favourable nucleus. In\r\nthe same way we may explain the formation of the calcareous nodules,\r\nknown as \"septaria\" or \"cement stones,\" which occur so commonly in\r\nthe London Clay and Kimmeridge Clay, and in which the principal\r\ningredient is carbonate of lime. A similar origin is to be ascribed\r\nto the nodules of clay iron-stone (impure carbonate of iron) which\r\noccur so abundantly in the shales of the Carboniferous series and\r\nin other argillaceous deposits; and a parallel modern example\r\nis to be found in the nodules of manganese, which were found\r\nby Sir Wyville Thomson, in the Challenger, to be so numerously\r\nscattered over the floor of the Pacific at great depths. In\r\naccordance with this mode of origin, it is exceedingly common\r\nto find in the centre of all these nodules, both old and new,\r\nsome organic body, such as a bone, a shell, or a tooth, which\r\nacted as the original nucleus of precipitation, and was thus\r\npreserved in a shroud of mineral matter. Many nodules, it is\r\ntrue, show no such nucleus; but it has been affirmed that all of\r\nthem can be shown, by appropriate microscopical investigation,\r\nto have been formed round an original organic body to begin with\r\n(Hawkins Johnson).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Apart from the occurrence or phosphate of lime in\r\nactual beds in the stratified rocks, as in the Laurentian and\r\nSilurian series, this salt may also occur disseminated through\r\nthe rock, when it can only be detected by chemical analysis. It\r\nis interesting to note that Dr Hicks has recently proved the\r\noccurrence of phosphate of lime in this disseminated form in\r\nrocks as old as the Cambrian, and that in quantity quite equal to\r\nwhat is generally found to be present in the later fossiliferous\r\nrocks. This affords a chemical proof that animal life flourished\r\nabundantly in the Cambrian seas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: It has been maintained, indeed, that the phosphatic\r\nnodules so largely worked for agricultural purposes, are in\r\nthemselves actual organic bodies or true fossils. In a few cases\r\nthis admits of demonstration, as it can be shown that the nodule\r\nis simply an organism (such as a sponge) infiltrated with phosphate\r\nof lime (Sollas); but there are many other cases in which no actual\r\nstructure has yet been shown to exist, and as to the true origin\r\nof which it would be hazardous to offer a positive opinion.]\r\n\r\nThe last lime-salt which need be mentioned is _gypsum_, or _sulphate\r\nof lime_. This substance, apart from other modes of occurrence, is\r\nnot uncommonly found interstratified with the ordinary sedimentary\r\nrocks, in the form of more or less irregular beds; and in these\r\ncases it has a palæontological importance, as occasionally yielding\r\nwell-preserved fossils. Whilst its exact mode of origin is uncertain,\r\nit cannot be regarded as in itself an organic rock, though clearly\r\nthe product of chemical action. To look at, it is usually a whitish\r\nor yellowish-white rock, as coarsely crystalline as loaf-sugar,\r\nor more so; and the microscope shows it to be composed entirely\r\nof crystals of sulphate of lime.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the _calcareous_ or lime-containing rocks are\r\nthe most important of the group of organic deposits; whilst the\r\n_siliceous_ or flint-containing rocks may be regarded as the\r\nmost important, most typical, and most generally distributed\r\nof the mechanically-formed rocks. We have, however, now briefly\r\nto consider certain deposits which are more or less completely\r\nformed of flint; but which, nevertheless, are essentially organic\r\nin their origin.\r\n\r\nFlint or silex, hard and intractable as it is, is nevertheless\r\ncapable of solution in water to a certain extent, and even of\r\nassuming, under certain circumstances, a gelatinous or viscous\r\ncondition. Hence, some hot-springs are impregnated with silica\r\nto a considerable extent; it is present in small quantity in\r\nsea-water; and there is reason to believe that a minute proportion\r\nmust very generally be present in all bodies of fresh water as\r\nwell. It is from this silica dissolved in the water that many\r\nanimals and some plants are enabled to construct for themselves\r\nflinty skeletons; and we find that these animals and plants are and\r\nhave been sufficiently numerous to give rise to very considerable\r\ndeposits of siliceous matter by the mere accumulation of their\r\nskeletons. Amongst the animals which require special mention in\r\nthis connection are the microscopic organisms which are known to\r\nthe naturalist as _Polycystina_. These little creatures are of the\r\nlowest possible grade of organisation, very closely related to the\r\nanimals which we have previously spoken of as _Foraminifera_, but\r\ndiffering in the fact that they secrete a shell or skeleton composed\r\nof flint instead of lime. The _Polycystina_ occur abundantly in\r\nour present seas; and their shells are present in some numbers\r\nin the ooze which is found at great depths in the Atlantic and\r\nPacific oceans, being easily recognised by their exquisite shape,\r\ntheir glassy transparency, the general presence of longer or\r\nshorter spines, and the sieve-like perforations in the walls.\r\nBoth in Barbadoes and in the Nicobar islands occur geological\r\nformations which are composed of the flinty skeletons of these\r\nmicroscopic animals; the deposit in the former locality attaining\r\na great thickness, and having been long known to workers with\r\nthe microscope under the name of \"Barbadoes earth\" (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Shells of _Polycystina_ from \"Barbadoes\r\nearth;\" greatly magnified. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Cases of Diatoms in the Richmond \"Infusorial\r\nearth;\" highly magnified. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to flint-producing animals, we have also the great\r\ngroup of fresh-water and marine microscopic plants known as\r\n_Diatoms_, which likewise secrete a siliceous skeleton, often of\r\ngreat beauty. The skeletons of Diatoms are found abundantly at the\r\npresent day in lake-deposits, guano, the silt of estuaries, and in\r\nthe mud which covers many parts of the sea-bottom; they have been\r\ndetected in strata of great age; and in spite of their microscopic\r\ndimensions, they have not uncommonly accumulated to form deposits\r\nof great thickness, and of considerable superficial extent. Thus\r\nthe celebrated deposit of \"tripoli\" (\"Polir-schiefer\") of Bohemia,\r\nlargely worked as polishing-powder, is composed wholly, or almost\r\nwholly, of the flinty cases of Diatoms, of which it is calculated\r\nthat no less than forty-one thousand millions go to make up a\r\nsingle cubic inch of the stone. Another celebrated deposit is\r\nthe so-called \"Infusorial earth\" of Richmond in Virginia, where\r\nthere is a stratum in places thirty feet thick, composed almost\r\nentirely of the microscopic shells of Diatoms.\r\n\r\nNodules or layers of _flint_, or the impure variety of flint\r\nknown as _chert_, are found in limestones of almost all ages\r\nfrom the Silurian upwards; but they are especially abundant in\r\nthe chalk. When these flints are examined in thin and transparent\r\nslices under the microscope, or in polished sections, they are\r\nfound to contain an abundance of minute organic bodies--such as\r\n_Foraminifera_, sponge-spicules, &c.--embedded in a siliceous\r\nbasis. In many instances the flint contains larger organisms--such\r\nas a Sponge or a Sea-urchin. As the flint has completely surrounded\r\nand infiltrated the fossils which it contains, it is obvious\r\nthat it must have been deposited from sea-water in a gelatinous\r\ncondition, and subsequently have hardened. That silica is capable\r\nof assuming this viscous and soluble condition is known; and\r\nthe formation of flint may therefore be regarded as due to the\r\nseparation of silica from the sea-water and its deposition round\r\nsome organic body in a state of chemical change or decay, just as\r\nnodules of phosphate of lime or carbonate of iron are produced.\r\nThe existence of numerous organic bodies in flint has long been\r\nknown; but it should be added that a recent observer (Mr Hawkins\r\nJohnson) asserts that the existence of an organic structure can\r\nbe demonstrated by suitable methods of treatment, even in the\r\nactual matrix or basis of the flint.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: It has been asserted that the flints of the chalk\r\nare merely fossil sponges. No explanation of the origin of flint,\r\nhowever, can be satisfactory, unless it embraces the origin of\r\nchert in almost all great limestones from the Silurian upwards,\r\nas well as the common phenomenon of the silicification of organic\r\nbodies (such as corals and shells) which are known with certainty\r\nto have been originally calcareous.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to deposits formed of flint itself, there are other\r\nsiliceous deposits formed by certain _silicates_, and also of\r\norganic origin. It has been shown, namely--by observations carried\r\nout in our present seas--that the shells of _Foraminifera_ are\r\nliable to become completely infiltrated by silicates (such as\r\n\"glauconite,\" or silicate of iron and potash). Should the actual\r\ncalcareous shell become dissolved away subsequent to this\r\ninfiltration--as is also liable to occur--then, in place of the\r\nshells of the _Foraminifera_, we get a corresponding number of\r\ngreen sandy grains of glauconite, each grain being the _cast_\r\nof a single shell. It has thus been shown that the green sand\r\nfound covering the sea-bottom in certain localities (as found by\r\nthe Challenger expedition along the line of the Agulhas current)\r\nis really organic, and is composed of casts of the shells of\r\n_Foraminifera_. Long before these observations had been made,\r\nit had been shown by Professor Ehrenberg that the green sands of\r\nvarious geological formations are composed mainly of the internal\r\ncasts of the shells of _Foraminifera_, and we have thus another\r\nand a very interesting example how rock-deposits of considerable\r\nextent and of geological importance can be built up by the operation\r\nof the minutest living beings.\r\n\r\nAs regards _argillaceous_ deposits, containing _alumina_ or _clay_\r\nas their essential ingredient, it cannot be said that any of\r\nthese have been actually shown to be of organic origin. A recent\r\nobservation by Sir Wyville Thomson would, however, render it not\r\nimprobable that some of the great argillaceous accumulations of\r\npast geological periods may be really organic. This distinguished\r\nobserver, during the cruise of the Challenger, showed that the\r\ncalcareous ooze which has been already spoken of as covering\r\nlarge areas of the floor of the Atlantic and Pacific at great\r\ndepths, and which consists almost wholly of the shells of\r\n_Foraminifera_, gave place at still greater depths to a red ooze\r\nconsisting of impalpable clayey mud, coloured by oxide of iron,\r\nand devoid of traces of organic bodies. As the existence of this\r\nwidely-diffused red ooze, in mid-ocean, and at such great depths,\r\ncannot be explained on the supposition that it is a sediment\r\nbrought down into the sea by rivers, Sir Wyville Thomson came to\r\nthe conclusion that it was probably formed by the action of the\r\nsea-water upon the shells of _Foraminifera_. These shells, though\r\nmainly consisting of lime, also contain a certain proportion of\r\nalumina, the former being soluble in the carbonic acid dissolved\r\nin the sea-water, whilst the latter is insoluble. There would\r\nfurther appear to be grounds for believing that the solvent power\r\nof the sea-water over lime is considerably increased at great\r\ndepths. If, therefore, we suppose the shells of _Foraminifera_\r\nto be in course of deposition over the floor of the Pacific, at\r\ncertain depths they would remain unchanged, and would accumulate\r\nto form a calcareous ooze; but at greater depths they would be\r\nacted upon by the water, their lime would be dissolved out, their\r\nform would disappear, and we should simply have left the small\r\namount of alumina which they previously contained. In process\r\nof time this alumina would accumulate to form a bed of clay; and\r\nas this clay had been directly derived from the decomposition\r\nof the shells of animals, it would be fairly entitled to be\r\nconsidered an organic deposit. Though not finally established,\r\nthe hypothesis of Sir Wyville Thomson on this subject is of the\r\ngreatest interest to the palæontologist, as possibly serving to\r\nexplain the occurrence, especially in the older formations, of\r\ngreat deposits of argillaceous matter which are entirely destitute\r\nof traces of life.\r\n\r\nIt only remains, in this connection, to shortly consider the\r\nrock-deposits in which _carbon_ is found to be present in greater\r\nor less quantity. In the great majority of cases where rocks\r\nare found to contain carbon or carbonaceous matter, it can be\r\nstated with certainty that this substance is of organic origin,\r\nthough it is not necessarily derived from vegetables. Carbon\r\nderived from the decomposition of animal bodies is not uncommon;\r\nthough it never occurs in such quantity from this source as it\r\nmay do when it is derived from plants. Thus, many limestones are\r\nmore or less highly bituminous; the celebrated siliceous flags\r\nor so-called \"bituminous schists\" of Caithness are impregnated\r\nwith oily matter apparently derived from the decomposition of the\r\nnumerous fishes embedded in them; Silurian shales containing\r\nGraptolites, but destitute of plants, are not uncommonly\r\n\"anthracitic,\" and contain a small percentage of carbon derived\r\nfrom the decay of these zoophytes; whilst the petroleum so largely\r\nworked in North America has not improbably an animal origin.\r\nThat the fatty compounds present in animal bodies should more or\r\nless extensively impregnate fossiliferous rock-masses, is only\r\nwhat might be expected; but the great bulk of the carbon which\r\nexists stored up in the earth's crust is derived from plants;\r\nand the form in which it principally presents itself is that of\r\ncoal. We shall have to speak again, and at greater length, of\r\ncoal, and it is sufficient to say here that all the true coals,\r\nanthracites, and lignites, are of organic origin, and consist\r\nprincipally of the remains of plants in a more or less altered\r\ncondition. The bituminous shales which are found so commonly\r\nassociated with beds of coal also derive their carbon primarily\r\nfrom plants; and the same is certainly, or probably, the case\r\nwith similar shales which are known to occur in formations younger\r\nthan the Carboniferous. Lastly, carbon may occur as a conspicuous\r\nconstituent of rock-masses in the form of _graphite_ or _black-lead_.\r\nIn this form, it occurs in the shape of detached scales, of veins\r\nor strings, or sometimes of regular layers;[7] and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that in many instances it has an organic origin,\r\nthough this is not capable of direct proof. When present, at any\r\nrate, in quantity, and in the form of layers associated with\r\nstratified rocks, as is often the case in the Laurentian formation,\r\nthere can be little hesitation in regarding it as of vegetable\r\norigin, and as an altered coal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In the Huronian formation at Steel River, on the\r\nnorth shore of Lake Superior, there exists a bed of carbonaceous\r\nmatter which is regularly interstratified with the surrounding\r\nrocks, and has a thickness of from 30 to 40 feet. This bed is\r\nshown by chemical analysis to contain about 50 per cent of carbon,\r\npartly in the form of graphite, partly in the form of anthracite;\r\nand there can be little doubt but that it is really a stratum\r\nof \"metamorphic\" coal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF THE FOSSILIFEROUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe physical geologist, who deals with rocks simply as rocks,\r\nand who does not necessarily trouble himself about what fossils\r\nthey may contain, finds that the stratified deposits which form\r\nso large a portion of the visible part of the earth's crust are\r\nnot promiscuously heaped together, but that they have a certain\r\ndefinite arrangement. In each country that he examines, he finds\r\nthat certain groups of strata lie above certain other groups;\r\nand in comparing different countries with one another, he finds\r\nthat, in the main, the same groups of rocks are always found in the\r\nsame relative position to each other. It is possible, therefore,\r\nfor the physical geologist to arrange the known stratified rocks\r\ninto a successive series of groups, or \"formations,\" having a\r\ncertain definite order. The establishment of this physical order\r\namongst the rocks introduces, however, at once the element of\r\n_time_, and the physical succession of the strata can be converted\r\ndirectly into a historical or _chronological_ succession. This\r\nis obvious, when we reflect that any bed or set of beds of\r\nsedimentary origin is clearly and necessarily younger than all\r\nthe strata upon which it rests, and older than all those by which\r\nit is surmounted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, then, by an appeal to the rocks alone, to determine\r\nin each country the general physical succession of the strata,\r\nand this \"stratigraphical\" arrangement, when once determined,\r\ngives us the _relative_ ages of the successive groups. The task,\r\nhowever, of the physical geologist in this matter is immensely\r\nlightened when he calls in palæontology to his aid, and studies\r\nthe evidence of the fossils embedded in the rocks. Not only is\r\nit thus much easier to determine the order of succession of the\r\nstrata in any given region, but it becomes now for the first time\r\npossible to compare, with certainty and precision, the order of\r\nsuccession in one region with that which exists in other regions\r\nfar distant. The value of fossils as tests of the relative ages\r\nof the sedimentary rocks depends on the fact that they are not\r\nindefinitely or promiscuously scattered through the crust of the\r\nearth,--as it is conceivable that they might be. On the contrary,\r\nthe first and most firmly established law of Palæontology is, that\r\n_particular kinds of fossils are confined to particular rocks_,\r\nand _particular groups of fossils are confined to particular\r\ngroups of rocks_. Fossils, then, are distinctive of the rocks in\r\nwhich they are found--much more distinctive, in fact, than the\r\nmere mineral character of the rock can be, for _that_ commonly\r\nchanges as a formation is traced from one region to another,\r\nwhilst the fossils remain unaltered. It would therefore be quite\r\npossible for the palæontologist, by an appeal to the fossils\r\nalone, to arrange the series of sedimentary deposits into a pile\r\nof strata having a certain definite order. Not only would this\r\nbe possible, but it would be found--if sufficient knowledge had\r\nbeen brought to bear on both sides--that the palæontological\r\narrangement of the strata would coincide in its details with the\r\nstratigraphical or physical arrangement.\r\n\r\nHappily for science, there is no such division between the\r\npalæontologist and the physical geologist as here supposed; but\r\nby the combined researches of the two, it has been found possible\r\nto divide the entire series of stratified deposits into a number\r\nof definite _rock-groups_ or _formations_, which have a recognised\r\norder of succession, and each of which is characterised by possessing\r\nan assemblage of organic remains which do not occur in association\r\nin any other formation. Such an _assemblage of fossils_,\r\ncharacteristic of any given formation, represents the _life_ of\r\nthe particular _period_ in which the formation was deposited.\r\nIn this way the past history of the earth becomes divided into a\r\nseries of successive _life-periods_, each of which corresponds\r\nwith the deposition of a particular _formation_ or group of strata.\r\n\r\nWhilst particular _assemblages_ of organic forms characterise\r\nparticular _groups_ of rocks, it may be further said that, in\r\na general way, each subdivision of each formation has its own\r\npeculiar fossils, by which it may be recognised by a skilled\r\nworker in Palæontology. Whenever, for instance, we meet with\r\nexamples of the fossils which are known as _Graptolites_, we may\r\nbe sure that we are dealing with _Silurian_ rocks (leaving out\r\nof sight one or two forms doubtfully referred to this family).\r\nWe may, however, go much farther than this with perfect safety. If\r\nthe Graptolites belong to certain genera, we may be quite certain\r\nthat we are dealing with _Lower_ Silurian rocks. Furthermore, if\r\ncertain special forms are present, we may be even able to say to\r\nwhat exact subdivision of the Lower Silurian series they belong.\r\n\r\nAs regards particular fossils, however, or even particular classes\r\nof fossils, conclusions of this nature require to be accompanied\r\nby a tacit but well-understood reservation. So far as our present\r\nobservation goes, none of the undoubted Graptolites have ever been\r\ndiscovered in rocks later than those known upon other grounds\r\nto be Silurian; but it is possible that they might at any time be\r\ndetected in younger deposits. Similarly, the species and genera\r\nwhich we now regard as characteristic of the Lower Silurian, may\r\nat some future time be found to have survived into the Upper\r\nSilurian period. We should not forget, therefore, in determining\r\nthe age of strata by palæontological evidence, that we are always\r\nreasoning upon generalisations which are the result of experience\r\nalone, and which are liable to be vitiated by further and additional\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nWhen the palæontological evidence as to the age of any given\r\nset of strata is corroborated by the physical evidence, our\r\nconclusions may be regarded as almost certain; but there are\r\ncertain limitations and fallacies in the palæontological method\r\nof inquiry which deserve a passing mention. In the first place,\r\nfossils are not always present in the stratified rocks; many\r\naqueous rocks are unfossiliferous, through a thickness of hundreds\r\nor even thousands of feet of little-altered sediments; and even\r\namongst beds which do contain fossils, we often meet with strata\r\nof many feet or yards in thickness which are wholly destitute\r\nof any traces of fossils. There are, therefore, to begin with,\r\nmany cases in which there is no palæontological evidence extant\r\nor available as to the age of a given group of strata. In the\r\nsecond place, palæontological observers in different parts of\r\nthe world are liable to give different names to the same fossil,\r\nand in all parts of the world they are occasionally liable to\r\ngroup together different fossils under the same title. Both these\r\nsources of fallacy require to be guarded against in reasoning as\r\nto the age of strata from their fossil remains. Thirdly, the mere\r\nfact of fossils being found in beds which are known by physical\r\nevidence to be of different ages, has commonly led palæontologists\r\nto describe them as different species. Thus, the same fossil,\r\noccurring in successive groups of strata, and with the merely\r\ntrivial and varietal differences due to the gradual change in its\r\nenvironment, has been repeatedly described as a distinct species,\r\nwith a distinct name, in every bed in which it was found. We know,\r\nhowever, that many fossils range vertically through many groups\r\nof strata, and there are some which even pass through several\r\nformations. The mere fact of a difference of physical position\r\nought never to be taken into account at all in considering and\r\ndetermining the true affinities of a fossil. Fourthly, the results\r\nof experience, instead of being an assistance, are sometimes\r\nliable to operate as a source of error. When once, namely, a\r\ngeneralisation has been established that certain fossils occur\r\nin strata of a certain age, palæontologists are apt to infer\r\nthat _all_ beds containing similar fossils must be of the same\r\nage. There is a presumption, of course, that this inference would\r\nbe correct; but it is not a conclusion resting upon absolute\r\nnecessity, and there might be physical evidence to disprove it.\r\nFifthly, the physical geologist may lead the palæontologist astray\r\nby asserting that the physical evidence as to the age and position\r\nof a given group of beds is clear and unequivocal, when such\r\nevidence may be, in reality, very slight and doubtful. In this\r\nway, the observer may be readily led into wrong conclusions as\r\nto the nature of the organic remains--often obscure and\r\nfragmentary--which it is his business to examine, or he may be\r\nled erroneously to think that previous generalisations as to\r\nthe age of certain kinds of fossils are premature and incorrect.\r\nLastly, there are cases in which, owing to the limited exposure\r\nof the beds, to their being merely of local development, or to\r\nother causes, the physical evidence as to the age of a given\r\ngroup of strata may be entirely uncertain and unreliable, and\r\nin which, therefore, the observer has to rely wholly upon the\r\nfossils which he may meet with.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the above limitations and fallacies, there can be\r\nno doubt as to the enormous value of palæontology in enabling us\r\nto work out the historical succession of the sedimentary rocks.\r\nIt may even be said that in any case where there should appear\r\nto be a clear and decisive discordance between the physical and\r\nthe palæontological evidence as to the age of a given series\r\nof beds, it is the former that is to be distrusted rather than\r\nthe latter. The records of geological science contain not a few\r\ncases in which apparently clear physical evidence of superposition\r\nhas been demonstrated to have been wrongly interpreted; but the\r\nevidence of palæontology, when in any way sufficient, has rarely\r\nbeen upset by subsequent investigations. Should we find strata\r\ncontaining plants of the Coal-measures apparently resting upon\r\nother strata with Ammonites and Belemnites, we may be sure that\r\nthe physical evidence is delusive; and though the above is an\r\nextreme case, the presumption in all such instances is rather that\r\nthe physical succession has been misunderstood or misconstrued,\r\nthan that there has been a subversion of the recognised succession\r\nof life-forms.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that as the collective result of observations\r\nmade upon the superposition of rocks in different localities,\r\nfrom their mineral characters, and from their included fossils,\r\ngeologists have been able to divide the entire stratified series into\r\na number of different divisions or formations, each characterised\r\nby a _general_ uniformity of mineral composition, and by a special\r\nand peculiar _assemblage_ of organic forms. Each of these primary\r\ngroups is in turn divided into a series of smaller divisions,\r\ncharacterised and distinguished in the same way. It is not pretended\r\nfor a moment that all these primary rock-groups can anywhere be seen\r\nsurmounting one another regularly.[8] There is no region upon the\r\nearth where all the stratified formations can be seen together;\r\nand, even when most of them occur in the same country, they can\r\nnowhere be seen all succeeding each other in their regular and\r\nuninterrupted succession. The reason of this is obvious. There\r\nare many places--to take a single example--where one may see the\r\nthe Silurian rocks, the Devonian, and the Carboniferous rocks\r\nsucceeding one another regularly, and in their proper order. This\r\nis because the particular region where this occurs was always\r\nsubmerged beneath the sea while these formations were being\r\ndeposited. There are, however, many more localities in which\r\none would find the Carboniferous rocks resting unconformably upon\r\nthe Silurians without the intervention of any strata which could\r\nbe referred to the Devonian period. This might arise from one of\r\ntwo causes: 1. The Silurians might have been elevated above the\r\nsea immediately after their deposition, so as to form dry land\r\nduring the whole of the Devonian period, in which case, of course,\r\nno strata of the latter age could possibly be deposited in that\r\narea. 2. The Devonian might have been deposited upon the Silurian,\r\nand then the whole might have been elevated above the sea, and\r\nsubjected to an amount of denudation sufficient to remove the\r\nDevonian strata entirely. In this case, when the land was again\r\nsubmerged, the Carboniferous rocks, or any younger formation,\r\nmight be deposited directly upon Silurian strata. From one or\r\nother of these causes, then, or from subsequent disturbances\r\nand denudations, it happens that we can rarely find many of the\r\nprimary formations following one another consecutively and in\r\ntheir regular order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: As we have every reason to believe that dry land\r\nand sea have existed, at any rate from the commencement of the\r\nLaurentian period to the present day, it is quite obvious that\r\nno one of the great formations can ever, under any circumstances,\r\nhave extended over the entire globe. In other words, no one of\r\nthe formations can ever have had a greater geographical extent\r\nthan that of the seas of the period in which the formation was\r\ndeposited. Nor is there any reason for thinking that the proportion\r\nof dry land to ocean has ever been materially different to what\r\nit is at present, however greatly the areas of sea and land may\r\nhave changed as regards their place. It follows from the above,\r\nthat there is no sufficient basis for the view that the crust of\r\nthe earth is composed of a succession of concentric layers, like\r\nthe coats of an onion, each layer representing one formation.]\r\n\r\nIn no case, however, do we ever find the Devonian resting upon\r\nthe Carboniferous, or the Silurian rocks reposing on the Devonian.\r\nWe have therefore, by a comparison of many different areas, an\r\nestablished order of succession of the stratified formations, as\r\nshown in the subjoined ideal section of the crust of the earth\r\n(fig. 17).\r\n\r\nThe main subdivisions of the stratified rocks are known by the\r\nfollowing names:--\r\n\r\n   1. Laurentian.\r\n   2. Cambrian (with Huronian ?).\r\n   3. Silurian.\r\n   4. Devonian or Old Red Sandstone.\r\n   5. Carboniferous.\r\n   6. Permian  \\_ New Red Sandstone.\r\n   7. Triassic /\r\n   8. Jurassic or Oolitic.\r\n   9. Cretaceous.\r\n  10. Eocene.\r\n  11. Miocene.\r\n  12. Pliocene.\r\n  13. Post-tertiary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. IDEAL SECTION OF THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.]\r\n\r\nOf these primary rock divisions, the Laurentian, Cambrian, Silurian,\r\nDevonian, Carboniferous, and Permian are collectively grouped\r\ntogether under the name of the Primary or _Paloeozoic_ rocks (Gr.\r\n_palaios_, ancient; _zoe_, life). Not only do they constitute the\r\noldest stratified accumulations, but from the extreme divergence\r\nbetween their animals and plants and those now in existence, they may\r\nappropriately be considered as belonging to an \"Old-Life\" period of\r\nthe world's history. The Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous systems\r\nare grouped together as the _Secondary_ or _Mesozoic_ formations\r\n(Gr. _mesos_, intermediate; _zoe_, life); the organic remains of\r\nthis \"Middle-Life\" period being, on the whole, intermediate in\r\ntheir characters between those of the palæozoic epoch and those\r\nof more modern strata. Lastly, the Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene\r\nformations are grouped together as the _Tertiary_ or _Kainozoic_\r\nrocks (Gr. _kainos_, new; _zoe_, life); because they constitute\r\na \"New-Life\" period, in which the organic remains approximate in\r\ncharacter to those now existing upon the globe. The so-called\r\n_Post-Tertiary_ deposits are placed with the Kainozoic, or may\r\nbe considered as forming a separate _Quaternary_ system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE BREAKS IN THE GEOLOGICAL AND PALÆONTOLOGICAL RECORD.\r\n\r\nThe term \"contemporaneous\" is usually applied by geologists to\r\ngroups of strata in different regions which contain the same\r\nfossils, or an assemblage of fossils in which many identical\r\nforms are present. That is to say, beds which contain identical,\r\nor nearly identical, fossils, however widely separated they may\r\nbe from one another in point of actual distance, are ordinarily\r\nbelieved to have been deposited during the same period of the\r\nearth's history. This belief, indeed, constitutes the keystone\r\nof the entire system of determining the age of strata by their\r\nfossil contents; and if we take the word \"contemporaneous\" in a\r\ngeneral and strictly geological sense, this belief can be accepted\r\nas proved beyond denial. We must, however, guard ourselves against\r\ntoo literal an interpretation of the word \"contemporaneous,\"\r\nand we must bear in mind the enormously-prolonged periods of\r\ntime with which the geologist has to deal. When we say that two\r\ngroups of strata in different regions are \"contemporaneous,\" we\r\nsimply mean that they were formed during the same geological\r\nperiod, and perhaps at different stages of that period, and we\r\ndo not mean to imply that they were formed at precisely the same\r\ninstant of time.\r\n\r\nA moment's consideration will show us that it is only in the former\r\nsense that we can properly speak of strata being \"contemporaneous;\"\r\nand that, in point of fact, beds containing the same fossils, if\r\noccurring in widely distant areas, can hardly be \"contemporaneous\"\r\nin any literal sense; but that the very identity of their fossils\r\nis proof that they were deposited one after the other. If we find\r\nstrata containing identical fossils within the limits of a single\r\ngeographical region--say in Europe--then there is a reasonable\r\nprobability that these beds are strictly contemporaneous, in the\r\nsense that they were deposited at the same time. There is a\r\nreasonable probability of this, because there is no improbability\r\ninvolved in the idea of an ocean occupying the whole area of\r\nEurope, and peopled throughout by many of the same species of\r\nmarine animals. At the present day, for example, many identical\r\nspecies of animals are found living on the western coasts of\r\nBritain and the eastern coasts of North America, and beds now\r\nin course of deposition off the shores of Ireland and the seaboard\r\nof the state of New York would necessarily contain many of the\r\nsame fossils. Such beds would be both literally and geologically\r\ncontemporaneous; but the case is different if the distance between\r\nthe areas where the strata occur be greatly increased. We find,\r\nfor example, beds containing identical fossils (the Quebec or\r\nSkiddaw beds) in Sweden, in the north of England, in Canada,\r\nand in Australia. Now, if all these beds were contemporaneous,\r\nin the literal sense of the term, we should have to suppose that\r\nthe ocean at one time extended uninterruptedly between all these\r\npoints, and was peopled throughout the vast area thus indicated\r\nby many of the same animals. Nothing, however, that we see at\r\nthe present day would justify us in imagining an ocean of such\r\nenormous extent, and at the same time so uniform in its depth,\r\ntemperature, and other conditions of marine life, as to allow the\r\nsame animals to flourish in it from end to end; and the example\r\nchosen is only one of a long and ever-recurring series. It is\r\ntherefore much more reasonable to explain this, and all similar\r\ncases, as owing to the _migration_ of the fauna, in whole or in\r\npart, from one marine area to another. Thus, we may suppose an\r\nocean to cover what is now the European area, and to be peopled\r\nby certain species of animals. Beds of sediment--clay, sands,\r\nand limestones--will be deposited over the sea-bottom, and will\r\nentomb the remains of the animals as fossils. After this has\r\nlasted for a certain length of time, the European area may undergo\r\nelevation, or may become otherwise unsuitable for the perpetuation\r\nof its fauna; the result of which would be that some or all of the\r\nmarine animals of the area would migrate to some more suitable\r\nregion. Sediments would then be accumulated in the new area to\r\nwhich they had betaken themselves, and they would then appear,\r\nfor the second time, as fossils in a set of beds widely separated\r\nfrom Europe. The second set of beds would, however, obviously\r\nnot be strictly or literally contemporaneous with the first, but\r\nwould be separated from them by the period of time required for\r\nthe migration of the animals from the one area into the other.\r\nIt is only in a wide and comprehensive sense that such strata\r\ncan be said to be contemporaneous.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enter further into this subject here; but it\r\nmay be taken as certain that beds in widely remote geographical\r\nareas can only come to contain the same fossils by reason of a\r\nmigration having taken place of the animals of the one area to\r\nthe other. That such migrations can and do take place is quite\r\ncertain, and this is a much more reasonable explanation of the\r\nobserved facts than the hypothesis that in former periods the\r\nconditions of life were much more uniform than they are at present,\r\nand that, consequently, the same organisms were able to range over\r\nthe entire globe at the same time. It need only be added, that\r\ntaking the evidence of the present as explaining the phenomena\r\nof the past--the only safe method of reasoning in geological\r\nmatters--we have abundant proof that deposits which _are_ actually\r\ncontemporaneous, in the strict sense of the term, _do not contain\r\nthe same fossils, if far removed from one another in point of\r\ndistance_. Thus, deposits of various kinds are now in process of\r\nformation in our existing seas, as, for example, in the Arctic\r\nOcean, the Atlantic, and the Pacific, and many of these deposits\r\nare known to us by actual examination and observation with the\r\nsounding-lead and dredge. But it is hardly necessary to add that\r\nthe animal remains contained in these deposits--the fossils of some\r\nfuture period--instead of being identical, are widely different\r\nfrom one another in their characters.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, then, that the entire stratified series is capable of\r\nsubdivision into a number of definite rock-groups or \"formations,\"\r\neach possessing a peculiar and characteristic assemblage of fossils,\r\nrepresenting the \"life\" of the \"period\" in which the formation\r\nwas deposited. We have still to inquire shortly how it came to\r\npass that two successive formations _should_ thus be broadly\r\ndistinguished by their life-forms, and why they should not rather\r\npossess at any rate a majority of identical fossils. It was\r\noriginally supposed that this could be explained by the hypothesis\r\nthat the close of each formation was accompanied by a general\r\ndestruction of all the living beings of the period, and that\r\nthe commencement of each new formation was signalised by the\r\ncreation of a number of brand-new organisms, destined to figure\r\nas the characteristic fossils of the same. This theory, however,\r\nignores the fact that each formation--as to which we have any\r\nsufficient evidence--contains a few, at least, of the life-forms\r\nwhich existed in the preceding period; and it invokes forces\r\nand processes of which we know nothing, and for the supposed\r\naction of which we cannot account. The problem is an undeniably\r\ndifficult one, and it will not be possible here to give more than\r\na mere outline of the modern views upon the subject. Without\r\nentering into the at present inscrutable question as to the manner\r\nin which new life-forms are introduced upon the earth, it may be\r\nstated that almost all modern geologists hold that the living\r\nbeings of any given formation are in the main modified forms of\r\nothers which have preceded them. It is not believed that any\r\ngeneral or universal destruction of life took place at the\r\ntermination of each geological period, or that a general introduction\r\nof new forms took place at the commencement of a new period.\r\nIt is, on the contrary, believed that the animals and plants\r\nof any given period are for the most part (or exclusively) the\r\nlineal but modified descendants of the animals and plants of\r\nthe immediately preceding period, and that some of them, at any\r\nrate, are continued into the next succeeding period, either\r\nunchanged, or so far altered as to appear as new species. To\r\ndiscuss these views in detail would lead us altogether too far,\r\nbut there is one very obvious consideration which may advantageously\r\nreceive some attention. It is obvious, namely, that the great\r\ndiscordance which is found to subsist between the animal life of\r\nany given formation and that of the next succeeding formation,\r\nand which no one denies, would be a fatal blow to the views just\r\nalluded to, unless admitting of some satisfactory explanation.\r\nNor is this discordance one purely of life-forms, for there is\r\noften a physical break in the successions of strata as well.\r\nLet us therefore briefly consider how far these interruptions\r\nand breaks in the geological and palæontological record can be\r\naccounted for, and still allow us to believe in some theory of\r\ncontinuity as opposed to the doctrine of intermittent and occasional\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is perfectly clear that if we admit the\r\nconception above mentioned of a continuity of life from the\r\nLaurentian period to the present day, we could never _prove_ our\r\nview to be correct, unless we could produce in evidence fossil\r\nexamples of _all_ the kinds of animals and plants that have lived\r\nand died during that period. In order to do this, we should require,\r\nto begin with, to have access to an absolutely unbroken and perfect\r\nsuccession of all the deposits which have ever been laid down\r\nsince the beginning. If, however, we ask the physical geologist\r\nif he is in possession of any such uninterrupted series, he will\r\nat once answer in the negative. So far from the geological series\r\nbeing a perfect one, it is interrupted by numerous gaps of unknown\r\nlength, many of which we can never expect to fill up. Nor are\r\nthe proofs of this far to seek. Apart from the facts that we\r\nhave hitherto examined only a limited portion of the dry land,\r\nthat nearly two-thirds of the entire area of the globe is\r\ninaccessible to geological investigation in consequence of its\r\nbeing covered by the sea, that many deposits can be shown to\r\nhave been more or less completely destroyed subsequent to their\r\ndeposition, and that there may be many areas in which living\r\nbeings exist where no rock is in process of formation, we have\r\nthe broad fact that rock-deposition only goes on to any extent\r\nin water, and that the earth must have always consisted partly of\r\ndry land and partly of water--at any rate, so far as any period\r\nof which we have geological knowledge is concerned. There _must_,\r\ntherefore, always have existed, at some part or another of the\r\nearth's surface, areas where no deposition of rock was going on,\r\nand the proof of this is to be found in the well-known phenomenon\r\nof \"_unconformability_.\" Whenever, namely, deposition of sediment\r\nis continuously going on within the limits of a single ocean, the\r\nbeds which are laid down succeed one another in uninterrupted\r\nand regular sequence. Such beds are said to be \"conformable,\" and\r\nthere are many rock-groups known where one may pass through fifteen\r\nor twenty thousand feet of strata without a break--indicating\r\nthat the beds had been deposited in an area which remained\r\ncontinuously covered by the sea. On the other hand, we commonly\r\nfind that there is no such regular succession when we pass from\r\none great formation to another, but that, on the contrary, the\r\nyounger formation rests \"unconformably,\" as it is called, either\r\nupon the formation immediately preceding it in point of time,\r\nor upon some still older one. The essential physical feature of\r\nthis unconformability is that the beds of the younger formation\r\nrest upon a worn and eroded surface formed by the beds of the\r\nolder series (fig. 18); and a moment's consideration will show\r\nus what this indicates. It indicates, beyond the possibility of\r\nmisconception, that there was an interval between the deposition\r\nof the older series and that of the newer series of strata; and\r\nthat during this interval the older beds were raised above the\r\nsea-level, so as to form dry land, and were subsequently depressed\r\nagain beneath the waters, to receive upon their worn and wasted\r\nupper surface the sediments of the later group. During the interval\r\nthus indicated, the deposition of rock must of necessity have\r\nbeen proceeding more or less actively in other areas. Every\r\nunconformity, therefore, indicates that at the spot where it\r\noccurs, a more or less extensive series of beds must be actually\r\nmissing; and though we may sometimes be able to point to these\r\nmissing strata in other areas, there yet remains a number of\r\nunconformities for which we cannot at present supply the deficiency\r\neven in a partial manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Section showing strata of Tertiary age\r\n(a) resting upon a worn and eroded surface of White Chalk (b),\r\nthe stratification of which is marked by lines of flint.]\r\n\r\nIt follows from the above that the series of stratified deposits\r\nis to a greater or less extent irremediably imperfect; and in\r\nthis imperfection we have one great cause why we can never obtain\r\na perfect series of all the animals and plants that have lived\r\nupon the globe. Wherever one of these great physical gaps occurs,\r\nwe find, as we might expect, a corresponding break in the series\r\nof life-forms. In other words, whenever we find two formations\r\nto be unconformable, we shall always find at the same time that\r\nthere is a great difference in their fossils, and that many of\r\nthe fossils of the older formation do not survive into the newer,\r\nwhilst many of those in the newer are not known to occur in the\r\nolder. The cause of this is, obviously, that the lapse of time,\r\nindicated by the unconformability, has been sufficiently great\r\nto allow of the dying out or modification of many of the older\r\nforms of life, and the introduction of new ones by immigration.\r\n\r\nApart, however, altogether, from these great physical breaks\r\nand their corresponding breaks in life, there are other reasons\r\nwhy we can never become more than partially acquainted with the\r\nformer denizens of the globe. Foremost amongst these is the fact\r\nthat an enormous number of animals possess no hard parts of the\r\nnature of a skeleton, and are therefore incapable, under any\r\nordinary circumstances, of leaving behind them any traces of\r\ntheir existence. It is true that there are cases in which animals\r\nin themselves completely soft-bodied are nevertheless able to leave\r\nmarks by which their former presence can be detected: Thus every\r\ngeologist is familiar with the winding and twisting \"trails\" formed\r\non the surface of the strata by sea-worms; and the impressions\r\nleft by the stranded carcases of Jelly-fishes on the fine-grained\r\nlithographic slates of Solenhofen supply us with an example of how\r\na creature which is little more than \"organised sea-water\" may\r\nstill make an abiding mark upon the sands of time. As a general\r\nrule, however, animals which have no skeletons are incapable of\r\nbeing preserved as fossils, and hence there must always have\r\nbeen a vast number of different kinds of marine animals of which\r\nwe have absolutely no record whatever. Again, almost all the\r\nfossiliferous rocks have been laid down in water; and it is a\r\nnecessary result of this that the great majority of fossils are\r\nthe remains of aquatic animals. The remains of air-breathing\r\nanimals, whether of the inhabitants of the land or of the air\r\nitself, are comparatively rare as fossils, and the record of\r\nthe past existence of these is much more imperfect than is the\r\ncase with animals living in water. Moreover, the fossiliferous\r\ndeposits are not only almost exclusively aqueous formations, but\r\nthe great majority are marine, and only a comparatively small\r\nnumber have been formed by lakes and rivers. It follows from the\r\nforegoing that the palæontological record is fullest and most\r\ncomplete so far as sea-animals are concerned, though even here we\r\nfind enormous gaps, owing to the absence of hard structures in\r\nmany great groups; of animals inhabiting fresh waters our knowledge\r\nis rendered still further incomplete by the small proportion\r\nthat fluviatile and lacustrine deposits bear to marine; whilst\r\nwe have only a fragmentary acquaintance with the air-breathing\r\nanimals which inhabited the earth during past ages.\r\n\r\nLastly, the imperfection of the palæontological record, due to\r\nthe causes above enumerated, is greatly aggravated, especially\r\nas regards the earlier portion of the earth's history, by the\r\nfact that many rocks which contained fossils when deposited have\r\nsince been rendered barren of organic remains. The principal cause\r\nof this common phenomenon is what is known as \"metamorphism\"--that\r\nis, the subjection of the rock to a sufficient amount of heat to\r\ncause a rearrangement of its particles. When at all of a pronounced\r\ncharacter, the result of metamorphic action is invariably the\r\nobliteration of any fossils which might have been originally\r\npresent in the rock. Metamorphism may affect rocks of any age,\r\nthough naturally more prevalent in the older rocks, and to this\r\ncause must be set down an irreparable loss of much fossil evidence.\r\nThe most striking example which is to be found of this is the\r\ngreat Laurentian series, which comprises some 30,000 feet of\r\nhighly-metamorphosed sediments, but which, with one not wholly\r\nundisputed exception, has as yet yielded no remains of living\r\nbeings, though there is strong evidence of the former existence\r\nin it of fossils.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, then, we cannot doubt that the earth's crust, so\r\nfar as yet deciphered by us, presents us with but a very imperfect\r\nrecord of the past. Whether the known and admitted imperfections\r\nof the geological and palæontological records are sufficiently\r\nserious to account satisfactorily for the deficiency of direct\r\nevidence recognisable in some modern hypotheses, may be a matter\r\nof individual opinion. There can, however, be little doubt that\r\nthey are sufficiently extensive to throw the balance of evidence\r\ndecisively in favour of some theory of _continuity_, as opposed\r\nto any theory of intermittent and occasional action. The apparent\r\nbreaks which divide the great series of the stratified rocks\r\ninto a number of isolated formations, are not marks of mighty\r\nand general convulsions of nature, but are simply indications\r\nof the imperfection of our knowledge. Never, in all probability,\r\nshall we be able to point to a complete series of deposits, or a\r\ncomplete succession of life linking one great geological period\r\nto another. Nevertheless, we may well feel sure that such deposits\r\nand such an unbroken succession must have existed at one time.\r\nWe are compelled to believe that nowhere in the long series of\r\nthe fossiliferous rocks has there been a total break, but that\r\nthere must have been a complete continuity of life, and a more\r\nor less complete continuity of sedimentation, from the Laurentian\r\nperiod to the present day. One generation hands on the lamp of\r\nlife to the next, and each system of rocks is the direct offspring\r\nof those which preceded it in time. Though there has not been\r\ncontinuity in any given area, still the geological chain could\r\nnever have been snapped at one point, and taken up again at a\r\ntotally different one. Thus we arrive at the conviction that\r\n_continuity_ is the fundamental law of geology, as it is of the\r\nother sciences, and that the lines of demarcation between the\r\ngreat formations are but gaps in our own knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM FOSSILS.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that geologists have been led by the study\r\nof fossils to the all-important generalisation that the vast\r\nseries of the Fossiliferous or Sedimentary Rocks may be divided\r\ninto a number of definite groups or \"formations,\" each of which is\r\ncharacterised by its organic remains. It may simply be repeated here\r\nthat these formations are not properly and strictly characterised\r\nby the occurrence in them of any one particular fossil. It may be\r\nthat a formation contains some particular fossil or fossils not\r\noccurring out of that formation, and that in this way an observer\r\nmay identify a given group with tolerable certainty. It very often\r\nhappens, indeed, that some particular stratum, or sub-group of a\r\nseries, contains peculiar fossils, by which its existence may\r\nbe determined in various localities. As before remarked, however,\r\nthe great formations are characterised properly by the association\r\nof certain fossils, by the predominance of certain families or\r\norders, or by an _assemblage_ of fossil remains representing\r\nthe \"life\" of the period in which the formation was deposited.\r\n\r\nFossils, then, enable us to determine the _age_ of the deposits\r\nin which they occur. Fossils further enable us to come to very\r\nimportant conclusions as to the mode in which the fossiliferous\r\nbed was deposited, and thus as to the condition of the particular\r\ndistrict or region occupied by the fossiliferous bed at the time\r\nof the formation of the latter. If, in the first place, the bed\r\ncontain the remains of animals such as now inhabit rivers, we\r\nknow that it is \"fluviatile\" in its origin, and that it must at\r\none time have either formed an actual riverbed, or been deposited\r\nby the overflowing of an ancient stream. Secondly, if the bed\r\ncontain the remains of shellfish, minute crustaceans, or fish,\r\nsuch as now inhabit lakes, we know that it is \"lacustrine,\" and\r\nwas deposited beneath the waters of a former lake. Thirdly, if\r\nthe bed contain the remains of animals such as now people the\r\nocean, we know that it is \"marine\" in its origin, and that it\r\nis a fragment of an old sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, often determine the conditions under which a bed\r\nwas deposited with greater accuracy than this. If, for example, the\r\nfossils are of kinds resembling the marine animals now inhabiting\r\nshallow waters, if they are accompanied by the detached relics\r\nof terrestrial organisms, or if they are partially rolled and\r\nbroken, we may conclude that the fossiliferous deposit was laid\r\ndown in a shallow sea, in the immediate vicinity of a coast-line,\r\nor as an actual shore-deposit. If, again, the remains are those\r\nof animals such as now live in the deeper parts of the ocean,\r\nand there is a very sparing intermixture of extraneous fossils\r\n(such as the bones of birds or quadrupeds, or the remains of\r\nplants), we may presume that the deposit is one of deep water.\r\nIn other cases, we may find, scattered through the rock, and\r\nstill in their natural position, the valves of shells such as\r\nwe know at the present day as living buried in the sand or mud\r\nof the sea-shore or of estuaries. In other cases, the bed may\r\nobviously have been an ancient coral-reef, or an accumulation of\r\nsocial shells, like Oysters. Lastly, if we find the deposit to\r\ncontain the remains of marine shells, but that these are dwarfed\r\nof their fair proportions and distorted in figure, we may conclude\r\nthat it was laid down in a brackish sea, such as the Baltic, in\r\nwhich the proper saltness was wanting, owing to its receiving\r\nan excessive supply of fresh water.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding, we have been dealing simply with the remains\r\nof aquatic animals, and we have seen that certain conclusions\r\ncan be accurately reached by an examination of these. As regards\r\nthe determination of the conditions of deposition from the remains\r\nof aerial and terrestrial animals, or from plants, there is not\r\nsuch an absolute certainty. The remains of land-animals would,\r\nof course, occur in \"sub-aerial\" deposits--that is, in beds,\r\nlike blown sand, accumulated upon the land. Most of the remains\r\nof land-animals, however, are found in deposits which have been\r\nlaid down in water, and they owe their present position to the\r\nfact that their former owners were drowned in rivers or lakes,\r\nor carried out to sea by streams. Birds, Flying Reptiles, and\r\nFlying Mammals might also similarly find their way into aqueous\r\ndeposits; but it is to be remembered that many birds and mammals\r\nhabitually spend a great part of their time in the water, and\r\nthat these might therefore be naturally expected to present\r\nthemselves as fossils in Sedimentary Rocks. Plants, again, even\r\nwhen undoubtedly such as must have grown on land, do not prove\r\nthat the bed in which they occur was formed on land. Many of the\r\nremains of plants known to us are extraneous to the bed in which\r\nthey are now found, having reached their present site by falling\r\ninto lakes or rivers, or being carried out to sea by floods or\r\ngales of wind. There are, however, many cases in which plants\r\nhave undoubtedly grown on the very spot where we now find them.\r\nThus it is now generally admitted that the great coal-fields\r\nof the Carboniferous age are the result of the growth _in situ_\r\nof the plants which compose coal, and that these grew on vast\r\nmarshy or partially submerged tracts of level alluvial land. We\r\nhave, however, distinct evidence of old land-surfaces, both in\r\nthe Coal-measures and in other cases (as, for instance, in the\r\nwell-known \"dirt-bed\" of the Purbeck series). When, for example,\r\nwe find the erect stumps of trees standing at right angles to\r\nthe surrounding strata, we know that the surface through which\r\nthese send their roots was at one time the surface of the dry\r\nland, or, in other words, was an ancient soil (fig. 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Erect Tree containing Reptilian remains.\r\nCoal-measures, Nova Scotia. (After Dawson.)\r\n\r\nIn many cases fossils enable us to come to important conclusions\r\nas to the climate of the period in which they lived but only a\r\nfew instances of this can be here adduced. As fossils in the\r\nmajority of instances are the remains of marine animals, it is\r\nmostly the temperature of the sea which can alone be determined\r\nin this way; and it is important to remember that, owing to the\r\nexistence of heated currents, the marine climate of a given area\r\ndoes not necessarily imply a correspondingly warm climate in\r\nthe neighbouring land. Land-climates can only be determined by\r\nthe remains of land-animals or land-plants, and these are\r\ncomparatively rare as fossils. It is also important to remember\r\nthat all conclusions on this head are really based upon the present\r\ndistribution of animal and vegetable life on the globe, and are\r\ntherefore liable to be vitiated by the following considerations:--\r\n\r\na. Most fossils are extinct, and it is not certain that the\r\nhabits and requirements of any extinct animal were exactly similar\r\nto those of its nearest living relative.\r\n\r\nb. When we get very far back in time, we meet with groups of\r\norganisms so unlike anything we know at the present day as to\r\nrender all conjectures as to climate founded upon their supposed\r\nhabits more or less uncertain and unsafe.\r\n\r\nc. In the case of marine animals, we are as yet very far from\r\nknowing the exact limits of distribution of many species within\r\nour present seas; so that conclusions drawn from living forms\r\nas to extinct species are apt to prove incorrect. For instance,\r\nit has recently been shown that many shells formerly believed to\r\nbe confined to the Arctic Seas have, by reason of the extension\r\nof Polar currents, a wide range to the south; and this has thrown\r\ndoubt upon the conclusions drawn from fossil shells as to the\r\nArctic conditions under which certain beds were supposed to have\r\nbeen deposited.\r\n\r\nd. The distribution of animals at the present day is certainly\r\ndependent upon other conditions beside climate alone; and the causes\r\nwhich now limit the range of given animals are certainly such as\r\nbelong to the existing order of things. But the establishment of\r\nthe present order of things does not date back in many cases to\r\nthe introduction of the present species of animals. Even in the\r\ncase, therefore, of existing species of animals, it can often\r\nbe shown that the past distribution of the species was different\r\nformerly to what it is now, not necessarily because the climate\r\nhas changed, but because of the alteration of other conditions\r\nessential to the life of the species or conducing to its extension.\r\n\r\nStill, we are in many cases able to draw completely reliable\r\nconclusions as to the climate of a given geological period, by\r\nan examination of the fossils belonging to that period. Among\r\nthe more striking examples of how the past climate of a region\r\nmay be deduced from the study of the organic remains contained in\r\nits rocks, the following may be mentioned: It has been shown that\r\nin Eocene times, or at the commencement of the Tertiary period,\r\nthe climate of what is now Western Europe was of a tropical or\r\nsub-tropical character. Thus the Eocene beds are found to contain\r\nthe remains of shells such as now inhabit tropical seas, as, for\r\nexample, Cowries and Volutes; and with these are the fruits of\r\npalms, and the remains of other tropical plants. It has been\r\nshown, again, that in Miocene times, or about the middle of the\r\nTertiary period, Central Europe was peopled with a luxuriant\r\nflora resembling that of the warmer parts of the United States,\r\nand leading to the conclusion that the mean annual temperature\r\nmust have been at least 30° hotter than it is at present. It has\r\nbeen shown that, at the same time, Greenland, now buried beneath\r\na vast ice-shroud, was warm enough to support a large number of\r\ntrees, shrubs, and other plants, such as inhabit temperate regions\r\nof the globe. Lastly, it has been shown upon physical as well as\r\npalæontological evidence, that the greater part of the North\r\nTemperate Zone, at a comparatively recent geological period, has\r\nbeen visited with all the rigours of an Arctic climate, resembling\r\nthat of Greenland at the present day. This is indicated by the\r\noccurrence of Arctic shells in the superficial deposits of this\r\nperiod, whilst the Musk-ox and the Reindeer roamed far south of\r\ntheir present limits.\r\n\r\nLastly, it was from the study of fossils that geologists learnt\r\noriginally to comprehend a fact which may be regarded as of cardinal\r\nimportance in all modern geological theories and\r\nspeculations--namely, that the crust of the earth is liable to\r\nlocal elevations and subsidences. For long after the remains of\r\nshells and other marine animals were for the first time observed\r\nin the solid rocks forming the dry land, and at great heights\r\nabove the sea-level, attempts were made to explain this almost\r\nunintelligible phenomenon upon the hypothesis that the fossils\r\nin question were not really the objects they represented, but\r\nwere in truth mere _lusus naturoe_, due to some \"plastic virtue\r\nlatent in the earth.\" The common-sense of scientific men, however,\r\nsoon rejected this idea, and it was agreed by universal consent\r\nthat these bodies really were remains of animals which formerly\r\nlived in the sea. When once this was admitted, the further steps\r\nwere comparatively easy, and at the present day no geological\r\ndoctrine stands on a firmer basis than that which teaches us\r\nthat our present continents and islands, fixed and immovable as\r\nthey appear, have been repeatedly sunk beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BIOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF FOSSILS.\r\n\r\nNot only have fossils, as we have seen, a most important bearing\r\nupon the sciences of Geology and Physical Geography, but they\r\nhave relations of the most complicated and weighty character with\r\nthe numerous problems connected with the study of living beings,\r\nor in other words, with the science of Biology. To such an extent\r\nis this the case, that no adequate comprehension of Zoology and\r\nBotany, in their modern form, is so much as possible without\r\nsome acquaintance with the types of animals and plants which have\r\npassed away. There are also numerous speculative questions in\r\nthe domain of vital science, which, if soluble at all, can only\r\nhope to find their key in researches carried out on extinct\r\norganisms. To discuss fully the biological relations of fossils\r\nwould, therefore, afford matter for a separate treatise; and all\r\nthat can be done here is to indicate very cursorily the principal\r\npoints to which the attention of the palæontological student\r\nought to be directed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the great majority of fossil animals and\r\nplants are \"extinct\"--that is to say, they belong to species\r\nwhich are no longer in existence at the present day. So far,\r\nhowever, from there being any truth in the old view that there\r\nwere periodic destructions of all the living beings in existence\r\nupon the earth, followed by a corresponding number of new creations\r\nof animals and plants, the actual facts of the case show that\r\nthe extinction of old forms and the introduction of new forms\r\nhave been processes constantly going on throughout the whole\r\nof geological time. Every species seems to come into being at\r\na certain definite point of time, and to finally disappear at\r\nanother definite point; though there are few instances indeed,\r\nif there are any, in which our present knowledge would permit\r\nus safely to fix with precision the times of entrance and exit.\r\nThere are, moreover, marked differences in the actual time during\r\nwhich different species remained in existence, and therefore\r\ncorresponding differences in their \"vertical range,\" or, in other\r\nwords, in the actual amount and thickness of strata through which\r\nthey present themselves as fossils. Some species are found to\r\nrange through two or even three formations, and a few have an\r\neven more extended life. More commonly the species which begin\r\nin the commencement of a great formation die out at or before its\r\nclose, whilst those which are introduced for the first time near\r\nthe middle or end of the formation may either become extinct, or\r\nmay pass on into the next succeeding formation. As a general rule,\r\nit is the animals which have the lowest and simplest organisation\r\nthat have the longest range in time, and the additional possession\r\nof microscopic or minute dimensions seems also to favour longevity.\r\nThus some of the _Foraminifera_ appear to have survived, with\r\nlittle or no perceptible alteration, from the Silurian period\r\nto the present day; whereas large and highly-organised animals,\r\nthough long-lived as _individuals_, rarely seem to live long\r\n_specifically_, and have, therefore, usually a restricted vertical\r\nrange. Exceptions to this, however, are occasionally to be found\r\nin some \"persistent types,\" which extend through a succession\r\nof geological periods with very little modification. Thus the\r\nexisting Lampshells of the genus _Lingula_ are little changed\r\nfrom the _Linguloe_ which swarmed in the Lower Silurian seas; and\r\nthe existing Pearly Nautilus is the last descendant of a clan\r\nnearly as ancient. On the other hand, some forms are singularly\r\nrestricted in their limits, and seem to have enjoyed a comparatively\r\nbrief lease of life. An example of this is to be found in many of\r\nthe _Ammonites_--close allies of the Nautilus--which are often\r\nconfined strictly to certain zones of strata, in some cases of\r\nvery insignificant thickness.\r\n\r\nOf the _causes_ of extinction amongst fossil animals and plants,\r\nwe know little or nothing. All we can say is, that the attributes\r\nwhich constitute a _species_ do not seem to be intrinsically\r\nendowed with permanence, any more than the attributes which\r\nconstitute an _individual_, though the former may endure whilst\r\nmany successive generations of the latter have disappeared. Each\r\nspecies appears to have its own life-period, its commencement,\r\nits culmination, and its gradual decay; and the life-periods\r\nof different species may be of very different duration.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above, it may be gathered that our existing\r\nspecies of animals and plants are, for the most part, quite of modern\r\norigin, using the term \"modern\" in its geological acceptation.\r\nMeasured by human standards, the majority of existing animals\r\n(which are capable of being preserved as fossils) are known to\r\nhave a high antiquity; and some of them can boast of a pedigree\r\nwhich even the geologist may regard with respect. Not a few of\r\nour shellfish are known to have commenced their existence at\r\nsome point of the Tertiary period; one Lampshell (_Terebratulina\r\ncaput-serpentis_) is believed to have survived since the Chalk; and\r\nsome of the _Foraminifera_ date, at any rate, from the Carboniferous\r\nperiod. We learn from this the additional fact that our existing\r\nanimals and plants do not constitute an assemblage of organic\r\nforms which were introduced into the world collectively and\r\nsimultaneously, but that they commenced their existence at very\r\ndifferent periods, some being extremely old, whilst others may be\r\nregarded as comparatively recent animals. And this introduction of\r\nthe existing fauna and flora was a slow and _gradual_ process, as\r\nshown admirably by the study of the fossil shells of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. Thus, in the earlier Tertiary period, we find about 95\r\nper cent of the known fossil shells to be species that are no\r\nlonger in existence, the remaining 5 per cent being forms which are\r\nknown to live in our present seas. In the middle of the Tertiary\r\nperiod we find many more recent and still existing species of\r\nshells, and the extinct types are much fewer in number; and this\r\ngradual introduction of forms now living goes on steadily, till,\r\nat the close of the Tertiary period, the proportions with which\r\nwe started may be reversed, as many as 90 or 95 per cent of the\r\nfossil shells being forms still alive, while not more than 5 per\r\ncent may have disappeared.\r\n\r\nAll known animals at the present day may be divided into some\r\nfive or six primary divisions, which are known technically as\r\n\"_sub-kingdoms_.\" Each of these sub-kingdoms [9] may be regarded\r\nas representing a certain type or plan of structure, and all\r\nthe animals comprised in each are merely modified forms of this\r\ncommon type. Not only are all known living animals thus reducible\r\nto some five or six fundamental plans of structure, but amongst\r\nthe vast series of fossil forms no one has yet been found--however\r\nunlike any existing animal--to possess peculiarities which would\r\nentitle it to be placed in a new sub-kingdom. All fossil animals,\r\ntherefore, are capable of being referred to one or other of the\r\nprimary divisions of the animal kingdom. Many fossil groups have\r\nno closely-related group now in existence; but in no case do\r\nwe meet with any grand structural type which has not survived\r\nto the present day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In the Appendix a brief definition is given of the\r\nsub-kingdoms, and the chief divisions of each are enumerated.]\r\n\r\nThe old types of life differ in many respects from those now\r\nupon the earth; and the further back we pass in time, the more\r\nmarked does this divergence become. Thus, if we were to compare\r\nthe animals which lived in the Silurian seas with those inhabiting\r\nour present oceans, we should in most instances find differences\r\nso great as almost to place us in another world. This divergence\r\nis the most marked in the Palæozoic forms of life, less so in\r\nthose of the Mesozoic period, and less still in the Tertiary\r\nperiod. Each successive formation has therefore presented us\r\nwith animals becoming gradually more and more like those now in\r\nexistence; and though there is an immense and striking difference\r\nbetween the Silurian animals and those of to-day, this difference\r\nis greatly reduced if we compare the Silurian fauna with the\r\nDevonian; _that_ again with the Carboniferous; and so on till\r\nwe reach the present.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the above that the animals of any given formation\r\nare more like those of the next formation below, and of the next\r\nformation above, than they are to any others; and this fact of\r\nitself is an almost inexplicable one, unless we believe that\r\nthe animals of any given formation are, in part at any rate, the\r\nlineal descendants of the animals of the preceding formation,\r\nand the progenitors, also in part at least, of the animals of the\r\nsucceeding formation. In fact, the palæontologist is so commonly\r\nconfronted with the phenomenon of closely-allied forms of animal\r\nlife succeeding one another in point of time, that he is compelled\r\nto believe that such forms have been developed from some common\r\nancestral type by some process of \"_evolution_.\" On the other\r\nhand, there are many phenomena, such as the apparently sudden\r\nintroduction of new forms throughout all past time, and the common\r\noccurrence of wholly isolated types, which cannot be explained\r\nin this way. Whilst it seems certain, therefore, that many of\r\nthe phenomena of the succession of animal life in past periods\r\ncan only be explained by some law of evolution, it seems at the\r\nsame time certain that there has always been some other deeper\r\nand higher law at work, on the nature of which it would be futile\r\nto speculate at present.\r\n\r\nNot only do we find that the animals of each successive formation\r\nbecome gradually more and more like those now existing upon the\r\nglobe, as we pass from the older rocks into the newer, but we also\r\nfind that there has been a gradual progression and development\r\nin the _types_ of animal life which characterise the geological\r\nages. If we take the earliest-known and oldest examples of any\r\ngiven group of animals, it can sometimes be shown that these\r\nprimitive forms, though in themselves highly organised, possessed\r\ncertain characters such as are now only seen in the _young_ of\r\ntheir existing representatives. In technical language, the early\r\nforms of life in some instances possess \"_embryonic_\" characters,\r\nthough this does not prevent them often attaining a size much\r\nmore gigantic than their nearest living relatives. Moreover, the\r\nancient forms of life are often what is called \"comprehensive\r\ntypes\"--that is to say, they possess characters in combination\r\nsuch as we nowadays only find separately developed in different,\r\ngroups of animals. Now, this permanent retention of embryonic\r\ncharacters and this \"comprehensiveness\" of structural type are\r\nsigns of what a zoologist considers to be a comparatively low\r\ngrade of organisation; and the prevalence of these features in\r\nthe earlier forms of animals is a very striking phenomenon, though\r\nthey are none the less perfectly organised so far as their own\r\ntype is concerned. As we pass upwards in the geological scale,\r\nwe find that these features gradually disappear, higher and ever\r\nhigher forms are introduced, and \"specialisation\" of type takes\r\nthe place of the former comprehensiveness. We shall have occasion\r\nto notice many of the facts on which these views are based at\r\na later period, and in connection with actual examples. In the\r\nmeanwhile, it is sufficient to state, as a widely-accepted\r\ngeneralisation of palæontology, that there has been in the past\r\na general progression of organic types, and that the appearance\r\nof the lower forms of life has in the main preceded that of the\r\nhigher forms in point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL PALÆONTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAURENTIAN AND HURONIAN PERIODS.\r\n\r\nThe _Laurentian Rocks_ constitute the base of the entire stratified\r\nseries, and are, therefore, the oldest sediments of which we have\r\nas yet any knowledge. They are more largely and more typically\r\ndeveloped in North America, and especially in Canada, than in\r\nany known part of the world, and they derive their title from\r\nthe range of hills which the old French geographers named the\r\n\"Laurentides.\" These hills are composed of Laurentian Rocks, and\r\nform the watershed between the valley of the St Lawrence river\r\non the one hand, and the great plains which stretch northwards\r\nto Hudson Bay on the other hand. The main area of these ancient\r\ndeposits forms a great belt of rugged and undulating country,\r\nwhich extends from Labrador westwards to Lake Superior, and then\r\nbends northwards towards the Arctic Sea. Throughout this extensive\r\narea the Laurentian Rocks for the most part present themselves\r\nin the form of low, rounded, ice-worn hills, which, if generally\r\nwanting in actual sublimity, have a certain geological grandeur\r\nfrom the fact that they \"have endured the battles and the storms\r\nof time longer than any other mountains\" (Dawson). In some places,\r\nhowever, the Laurentian Rocks produce scenery of the most magnificent\r\ncharacter, as in the great gorge cut through them by the river\r\nSaguenay, where they rise at times into vertical precipices 1500\r\nfeet in height. In the famous group of the Adirondack mountains,\r\nalso, in the state of New York, they form elevations no less than\r\n6000 feet above the level of the sea. As a general rule, the\r\ncharacter of the Laurentian region is that of a rugged, rocky,\r\nrolling country, often densely timbered, but rarely well fitted\r\nfor agriculture, and chiefly attractive to the hunter and the\r\nminer.\r\n\r\nAs regards its mineral characters, the Laurentian series is composed\r\nthroughout of metamorphic and highly crystalline rocks, which\r\nare in a high degree crumpled, folded, and faulted. By the late\r\nSir William Logan the entire series was divided into two great\r\ngroups, the _Lower Laurentian_ and the _Upper Laurentian_, of\r\nwhich the latter rests unconformably upon the truncated edges\r\nof the former, and is in turn unconformably overlaid by strata\r\nof Huronian and Cambrian age (fig. 20).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Diagrammatic section of the Laurentian\r\nRocks in Lower Canada. a Lower Laurentian; b Upper Laurentian,\r\nresting unconformably upon the lower series; c Cambrian strata\r\n(Potsdam Sandstone), resting unconformably on the Upper Laurentian.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lower Laurentian_ series attains the enormous thickness of\r\nover 20,000 feet, and is composed mainly of great beds of gneiss,\r\naltered sandstones (quartzites), mica-schist, hornblende-schist,\r\nmagnetic iron-ore, and hæmatite, together with masses of limestone.\r\nThe limestones are especially interesting, and have an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment--three principal beds being known, of which one is\r\nnot less than 1500 feet thick; the collective thickness of the\r\nwhole being about 3500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe _Upper Laurentian_ series, as before said, reposes unconformably\r\nupon the Lower Laurentian, and attains a thickness of at least\r\n10,000 feet. Like the preceding, it is wholly metamorphic, and\r\nis composed partly of masses of gneiss and quartzite; but it\r\nis especially distinguished by the possession of great beds of\r\nfelspathic rock, consisting principally of \"Labrador felspar.\"\r\n\r\nThough typically developed in the great Canadian area already\r\nspoken of, the Laurentian Rocks occur in other localities, both\r\nin America and in the Old World. In Britain, the so-called\r\n\"fundamental gneiss\" of the Hebrides and of Sutherlandshire is\r\nprobably of Lower Laurentian age, and the \"hypersthene rocks\"\r\nof the Isle of Skye may, with great probability, be regarded\r\nas referable to the Upper Laurentian. In other localities in\r\nGreat Britain (as in St David's, South Wales; the Malvern Hills;\r\nand the North of Ireland) occur ancient metamorphic deposits\r\nwhich also are probably referable to the Laurentian series. The\r\nso-called \"primitive gneiss\" of Norway appears to belong to the\r\nLaurentian, and the ancient metamorphic rocks of Bohemia and\r\nBavaria may be regarded as being approximately of the same age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Section of Lower Laurentian Limestone\r\nfrom Hull, Ottawa; enlarged five diameters. The rock is very\r\nhighly crystalline, and contains mica and other minerals. The\r\nirregular black masses in it are graphite. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nBy some geological writers the ancient and highly metamorphosed\r\nsediments of the Laurentian and the succeeding Huronian series\r\nhave been spoken of as the \"Azoic rocks\" (Gr. _a_, without; _zoe_,\r\nlife); but even if we were wholly destitute of any evidence of\r\nlife during these periods, this name would be objectionable upon\r\ntheoretical grounds. If a general name be needed, that of \"Eozoic\"\r\n(Gr. _eos_, dawn; _zoe_, life), proposed by Principal Dawson, is the\r\nmost appropriate. Owing to their metamorphic condition, geologists\r\nlong despaired of ever detecting any traces of life in the vast pile\r\nof strata which constitute the Laurentian System. Even before any\r\ndirect traces were discovered, it was, however, pointed out that\r\nthere were good reasons for believing that the Laurentian seas had\r\nbeen tenanted by an abundance of living beings. These reasons are\r\nbriefly as follows:--(1) Firstly, the Laurentian series consists,\r\nbeyond question, of marine sediments which originally differed\r\nin no essential respect from those which were subsequently laid\r\ndown in the Cambrian or Silurian periods. (2) In all formations\r\nlater than the Laurentian, any limestones which are present can\r\nbe shown, with few exceptions, to be _organic_ rocks, and to be\r\nmore or less largely made up of the comminuted debris of marine\r\nor fresh-water animals. The Laurentian limestones, in consequence\r\nof the metamorphism to which they have been subjected, are so\r\nhighly crystalline (fig. 21) that the microscope fails to detect\r\nany organic structure in the rock, and no fossils beyond those\r\nwhich will be spoken of immediately have as yet been discovered in\r\nthem. We know, however, of numerous cases in which limestones,\r\nof later age, and undoubtedly organic to begin with, have been\r\nrendered so intensely crystalline by metamorphic action that\r\nall traces of organic structure have been obliterated. We have\r\ntherefore, by analogy, the strongest possible ground for believing\r\nthat the vast beds of Laurentian limestone have been originally\r\norganic in their origin, and primitively composed, in the main,\r\nof the calcareous skeletons of marine animals. It would, in fact,\r\nbe a matter of great difficulty to account for the formation\r\nof these great calcareous masses on any other hypothesis. (3)\r\nThe occurrence of phosphate of lime in the Laurentian Rocks in\r\ngreat abundance, and sometimes in the form of irregular beds,\r\nmay very possibly be connected with the former existence in the\r\nstrata of the remains of marine animals of whose skeleton this\r\nmineral is a constituent. (4) The Laurentian Rocks contain a\r\nvast amount of carbon in the form of black-lead or _graphite_.\r\nThis mineral is especially abundant in the limestones, occurring\r\nin regular beds, in veins or strings, or disseminated through\r\nthe body of the limestone in the shape of crystals, scales, or\r\nirregular masses. The amount of graphite in some parts of the\r\nLower Laurentian is so great that it has been calculated as equal\r\nto the quantity of carbon present in an equal thickness of the\r\nCoal-measures. The general source of solid carbon in the crust\r\nof the earth is, however, plant-life; and it seems impossible to\r\naccount for the Laurentian graphite, except upon the supposition\r\nthat it is metamorphosed vegetable matter. (5) Lastly, the great\r\nbeds of iron-ore (peroxide and magnetic oxide) which occur in the\r\nLaurentian series interstratified with the other rocks, point\r\nwith great probability to the action of vegetable life; since\r\nsimilar deposits in later formations can commonly be shown to\r\nhave been formed by the deoxidising power of vegetable matter\r\nin a state of decay.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Principal Dawson, \"anyone of these reasons might,\r\nin itself, be held insufficient to prove so great and, at first\r\nsight, unlikely a conclusion as that of the existence of abundant\r\nanimal and vegetable life in the Laurentian; but the concurrence\r\nof the whole in a series of deposits unquestionably marine, forms\r\na chain of evidence so powerful that it might command belief\r\neven if no fragment of any organic or living form or structure\r\nhad ever been recognised in these ancient rocks.\" Of late years,\r\nhowever, there have been discovered in the Laurentian Rocks certain\r\nbodies which are believed to be truly the remains of animals,\r\nand of which by far the most important is the structure known\r\nunder the now celebrated name of _Eozoön_. If truly organic, a\r\nvery special and exceptional interest attaches itself to _Eozoön_,\r\nas being the most ancient fossil animal of which we have any\r\nknowledge; but there are some who regard it really a peculiar\r\nform of mineral structure, and a severe, protracted, and still\r\nunfinished controversy has been carried on as to its nature. Into\r\nthis controversy it is wholly unnecessary to enter here; and it\r\nwill be sufficient to briefly explain the structure of _Eozoön_,\r\nas elucidated by the elaborate and masterly investigations of\r\nCarpenter and Dawson, from the standpoint that it is a genuine\r\norganism--the balance of evidence up to this moment inclining\r\ndecisively to this view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Fragment of _Eozoön_, of the natural\r\nsize, showing alternate laminæ of loganite and dolomite. (After\r\nDawson.)]\r\n\r\nThe structure known as _Eozoön_ is found in various localities\r\nin the Lower Laurentian limestones of Canada, in the form of\r\nisolated masses or spreading layers, which are composed of thin\r\nalternating laminæ, arranged more or less concentrically (fig.\r\n22). The laminæ of these masses are usually of different colours\r\nand composition; one series being white, and composed of carbonate\r\nof lime--whilst the laminæ of the second series alternate with\r\nthe preceding, are green in colour, and are found by chemical\r\nanalysis to consist of some silicate, generally serpentine or the\r\nclosely-related \"loganite.\" In some instances, however, all the\r\nlaminæ are calcareous, the concentric arrangement still remaining\r\nvisible in consequence of the fact that the laminæ are composed\r\nalternately of lighter and darker coloured limestone.\r\n\r\nWhen first discovered, the masses of _Eozoön_ were supposed to\r\nbe of a mineral nature; but their striking general resemblance\r\nto the undoubted fossils which will be subsequently spoken of\r\nunder the name of _Stromatopora_ was recognised by Sir William\r\nLogan, and specimens were submitted for minute examination, first\r\nto Principal Dawson, and subsequently to Dr W. B. Carpenter.\r\nAfter a careful microscopic examination, these two distinguished\r\nobservers came to the conclusion that _Eozoön_ was truly organic,\r\nand in this opinion they were afterwards corroborated by other\r\nhigh authorities (Mr W. K. Parker, Professor Rupert Jones, Mr H.\r\nB. Brady, Professor Gümbel, &c.) Stated briefly, the structure\r\nof _Eozoön_, as exhibited by the microscope, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Diagram of a portion of _Eozoön_ cut\r\nvertically. A, B, C, Three tiers of chambers communicating with\r\none another by slightly constricted apertures: _a a_, The true\r\nshell-wall, perforated by numerous delicate tubes; _b b_. The\r\nmain calcareous skeleton (\"intermediate skeleton\"); c, Passage\r\nof communication (\"stolon-passage\") from one tier of chambers\r\nto another; d, Ramifying tubes in the calcareous skeleton.\r\n(After Carpenter.)]\r\n\r\nThe concentrically-laminated mass of _Eozoön_ is composed of\r\nnumerous calcareous layers, representing the original skeleton\r\nof the organism (fig. 23, b). These calcareous layers serve to\r\nseparate and define a series of chambers arranged in successive\r\ntiers, one above the other (fig. 23, A, B, C); and they are\r\nperforated not only by passages (fig. 23, c), which serve to\r\nplace successive tiers of chambers in communication, but also by\r\na system of delicate branching canals (fig. 23, d). Moreover,\r\nthe central and principal portion of each calcareous layer, with\r\nthe ramified canal-system just spoken of, is bounded both above\r\nand below by a thin lamina which has a structure of its own, and\r\nwhich may be regarded as the proper shell-wall (fig. 23, a a).\r\nThis proper wall forms the actual lining of the chambers, as well\r\nas the outer surface of the whole mass; and it is perforated with\r\nnumerous fine vertical tubes (fig. 24, a a), opening into the\r\nchambers and on to the surface by corresponding fine pores. From\r\nthe resemblance of this tubulated layer to similar structures\r\nin the shell of the Nummulite, it is often spoken of as the\r\n\"Nummuline layer.\" The chambers are sometimes piled up one above\r\nthe other in an irregular manner; but they are more commonly\r\narranged in regular tiers, the separate chambers being marked\r\noff from one another by projections of the wall in the form of\r\npartitions, which are so far imperfect as to allow of a free\r\ncommunication between contiguous chambers. In the original condition\r\nof the organism, all these chambers, of course, must have been\r\nfilled with living-matter; but they are found in the present\r\nstate of the fossil to be generally filled with some silicate,\r\nsuch as serpentine, which not only fills the actual chambers,\r\nbut has also penetrated the minute tubes of the proper wall and\r\nthe branching canals of the intermediate skeleton. In some cases\r\nthe chambers are simply filled with crystalline carbonate of\r\nlime. When the originally porous fossil has been permeated by\r\na silicate, it is possible to dissolve away the whole of the\r\ncalcareous skeleton by means of acids, leaving an accurate and\r\nbeautiful cast of the chambers and the tubes connected with them\r\nin the insoluble silicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Portion of one of the calcareous layers\r\nof _Eozoön_, magnified 100 diameters. a a, The proper wall\r\n(\"Nummuline layer\") of one of the chambers, showing the fine\r\nvertical tubuli with which it is penetrated, and which are slightly\r\nbent along the line a' a'. c c, The intermediate skeleton,\r\nwith numerous branched canals. The oblique lines are the cleavage\r\nplanes of the carbonate of lime, extending across both the\r\nintermediate skeleton and the proper wall. (After Carpenter.)]\r\n\r\nThe above are the actual appearances presented by _Eozoön_ when\r\nexamined microscopically, and it remains to see how far they\r\nenable us to decide upon its true position in the animal kingdom.\r\nThose who wish to study this interesting subject in detail must\r\nconsult the admirable memoirs by Dr W. B. Carpenter and Principal\r\nDawson: it will be enough here to indicate the results which\r\nhave been arrived at. The only animals at the present day which\r\npossess a continuous calcareous skeleton, perforated by pores\r\nand penetrated by canals, are certain organisms belonging to\r\nthe group of the _Foraminifera_. We have had occasion before\r\nto speak of these animals, and as they are not conspicuous or\r\ncommonly-known forms of life, it may be well to say a few words\r\nas to the structure of the living representatives of the group.\r\nThe _Foraminifera_ are all inhabitants of the sea, and are mostly\r\nof small or even microscopic dimensions. Their bodies are composed\r\nof an apparently structureless animal substance of an albuminous\r\nnature (\"sarcode\"), of a gelatinous consistence, transparent, and\r\nexhibiting numerous minute granules or rounded particles. The\r\nbody-substance cannot be said in itself to possess any definite\r\nform, except in so far as it may be bounded by a shell; but it\r\nhas the power, wherever it may be exposed, of emitting long\r\nthread-like filaments (\"pseudopodia\"), which interlace with one\r\nanother to form a network (fig. 25, b). These filaments can be\r\nthrown out at will, and to considerable distances, and can be\r\nagain retracted into the soft mass of the general body-substance,\r\nand they are the agents by which the animal obtains its food.\r\nThe soft bodies of the _Foraminifera_ are protected by a shell,\r\nwhich is usually calcareous, but may be composed of sand-grains\r\ncemented together; and it may consist of a single chamber (fig.\r\n26, a), or of many chambers arranged in different ways (fig.\r\n26, _b-f_). Sometimes the shell has but one large opening into\r\nit--the mouth; and then it is from this aperture that the animal\r\nprotrudes the delicate net of filaments with which it seeks its\r\nfood. In other cases the entire shell is perforated with minute\r\npores (fig. 26, e), through which the soft body-substance gains\r\nthe exterior, covering the whole shell with a gelatinous film\r\nof animal matter, from which filaments can be emitted at any\r\npoint. When the shell consists of many chambers, all of these are\r\nplaced in direct communication with one another, and the actual\r\nsubstance of the shell is often traversed by minute canals filled\r\nwith living matter (e.g., in _Calcarina_ and _Nummulina_). The\r\nshell, therefore, may be regarded, in such cases, as a more or\r\nless completely porous calcareous structure, filled to its minutest\r\ninternal recesses with the substance of the living animal, and\r\ncovered externally with a layer of the same substance, giving\r\noff a network of interlacing filaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--The animal of _Nonionina_, one of the\r\n_Foraminifera_, after the shell has been removed by a weak acid;\r\nb, _Gromia_, a single-chambered Foraminifer (after Schultze),\r\nshowing the shell surrounded by a network of filaments derived\r\nfrom the body substance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 26.--Shells of living _Foraminifera_. a,\r\n_Orbulina universa_, in its perfect condition, showing the tubular\r\nspines which radiate from the surface of the shell; b, _Globigerina\r\nbulloides_, in its ordinary condition, the thin hollow spines\r\nwhich are attached to the shell when perfect having been broken\r\noff; c, Textularia variabilis; d, Peneroplis planatus; e, Rotalia\r\nconcamerata; f, _Cristellaria subarcuatula._ [Fig. a is after\r\nWyville Thomson; the others are after Williamson. All the figures\r\nare greatly enlarged.]]\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the structure of the living _Foraminifera_;\r\nand it is believed that in _Eozoön_ we have an extinct example of\r\nthe same group, not only of special interest from its immemorial\r\nantiquity, but hardly less striking from its gigantic dimensions.\r\nIn its original condition, the entire chamber-system of _Eozoön_\r\nis believed to have been filled with soft structureless living\r\nmatter, which passed from chamber to chamber through the wide\r\napertures connecting these cavities, and from tier to tier by\r\nmeans of the tubuli in the shell-wall and the branching canals\r\nin the intermediate skeleton. Through the perforated shell-wall\r\ncovering the outer surface the soft body-substance flowed out,\r\nforming a gelatinous investment, from every point of which radiated\r\nan interlacing net of delicate filaments, providing nourishment\r\nfor the entire colony. In its present state, as before said,\r\nall the cavities originally occupied by the body-substance have\r\nbeen filled with some mineral substance, generally with one of\r\nthe silicates of magnesia; and it has been asserted that this\r\nfact militates strongly against the organic nature of _Eozoön_,\r\nif not absolutely disproving it. As a matter of fact, however--as\r\npreviously noticed--it is by no means very uncommon at the present\r\nday to find the shells of living species of _Foraminifera_ in which\r\nall the cavities primitively occupied by the body-substance, down\r\nto the minutest pores and canals, have been similarly injected\r\nby some analogous silicate, such as glauconite.\r\n\r\nThose, then, whose opinions on such a subject deservedly carry the\r\ngreatest weight, are decisively of opinion that we are presented\r\nin the _Eozoön_ of the Laurentian Rocks of Canada with an ancient,\r\ncolossal, and in some respects abnormal type of the _Foraminifera_.\r\nIn the words of Dr Carpenter, it is not pretended that \"the doctrine\r\nof the Foraminiferal nature of _Eozoön_ can be _proved_ in the\r\ndemonstrative sense;\" but it may be affirmed \"that the _convergence\r\nof a number of separate and independent probabilities_, all accordant\r\nwith that hypothesis, while a separate explanation must be invented\r\nfor each of them on any other hypothesis, gives it that _high\r\nprobability_ on which we rest in the ordinary affairs of life, in\r\nthe verdicts of juries, and in the interpretation of geological\r\nphenomena generally.\"\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be added, that whilst _Eozoön_ is by far the\r\nmost important organic body hitherto found in the Laurentian, and\r\nhas been here treated at proportionate length, other traces of life\r\nhave been detected, which may subsequently prove of great interest\r\nand importance. Thus, Principal Dawson has recently described\r\nunder the name of _Archoeosphoerinoe_ certain singular rounded\r\nbodies which he has discovered in the Laurentian limestones, and\r\nwhich he believes to be casts of the shells of _Foraminifera_\r\npossibly somewhat allied to the existing _Globigerinoe_. The same\r\neminent palæontologist has also described undoubted worm-burrows\r\nfrom rocks probably of Laurentian age. Further and more extended\r\nresearches, we may reasonably hope, will probably bring to light\r\nother actual remains of organisms in these ancient deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HURONIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe so-called _Huronian Rocks_, like the Laurentian, have their\r\ntypical development in Canada, and derive their name from the\r\nfact that they occupy an extensive area on the borders of Lake\r\nHuron. They are wholly metamorphic, and consist principally of\r\naltered sandstones or quartzites, siliceous, felspathic, or talcose\r\nslates, conglomerates, and limestones. They are largely developed\r\non the north shore of Lake Superior, and give rise to a broken\r\nand hilly country, very like that occupied by the Laurentians,\r\nwith an abundance of timber, but rarely with sufficient soil\r\nof good quality for agricultural purposes. They are, however,\r\nlargely intersected by mineral veins, containing silver, gold,\r\nand other metals, and they will ultimately doubtless yield a rich\r\nharvest to the miner. The Huronian Rocks have been identified,\r\nwith greater or less certainty, in other parts of North America,\r\nand also in the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of the Huronian Rocks in Canada is estimated\r\nas being not less than 18,000 feet, but there is considerable\r\ndoubt as to their precise geological position. In their typical\r\narea they rest unconformably on the edges of strata of _Lower_\r\nLaurentian age; but they have never been seen in direct contact\r\nwith the _Upper_ Laurentian, and their exact relations to this\r\nseries are therefore doubtful. It is thus open to question whether\r\nthe Huronian Rocks constitute a distinct formation, to be\r\nintercalated in point of time between the Laurentian and the\r\nCambrian groups; or whether, rather, they should not be considered\r\nas the metamorphosed representatives of the Lower Cambrian Rocks\r\nof other regions.\r\n\r\nAs regards the fossils of the Huronian Rocks, little can be said.\r\nSome of the specimens of _Eozoön Canadense_ which have been\r\ndiscovered in Canada are thought to come from rocks which are\r\nprobably of Huronian age. In Bavaria, Dr Gümbel has described a\r\nspecies of _Eozoön_ under the name of _Eozoön Bavaricum_, from\r\ncertain metamorphic limestones which he refers to the Huronian\r\nformation. Lastly, the late Mr Billings described, from rocks\r\nin Newfoundland apparently referable to the Huronian, certain\r\nproblematical limpet-shaped fossils, to which he gave the name\r\nof _Aspidella_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nAmongst the works and memoirs which the student may consult with\r\nregard to the Laurentian and Huronian deposits may be mentioned\r\nthe following:[10]--\r\n\r\n(1) 'Report of Progress of the Geological Survey of Canada from its\r\n    Commencement to 1863,' pp. 38-49, and pp. 50-66.\r\n(2) 'Manual of Geology.'

We have here the remains of the first\r\n_fauna_, or assemblage of animals, of which we have at present\r\nknowledge. As regards their geographical distribution, the Cambrian\r\nRocks have been recognised in many parts of the world, but there\r\nis some question as to the precise limits of the formation, and\r\nwe may consider that their most typical area is in South Wales,\r\nwhere they have been carefully worked out, chiefly by Dr Henry\r\nHicks. In this region, in the neighbourhood of the promontory\r\nof St David's, the Cambrian Rocks are largely developed, resting\r\nupon an ancient ridge of Pre-Cambrian (Laurentian?) strata, and\r\noverlaid by the lowest beds of the Lower Silurian. The subjoined\r\nsketch-section (fig. 27) exhibits in a general manner the succession\r\nof strata in this locality.\r\n\r\nFrom this section it will be seen that the Cambrian Rocks in\r\nWales are divided in the first place into a lower and an upper\r\ngroup. The _Lower Cambrian_ is constituted at the base by a great\r\nseries of grits, sandstones, conglomerates, and slates, which\r\nare known as the \"Longmynd group,\" from their vast development\r\nin the Longmynd Hills in Shropshire, and which attain in North\r\nWales a thickness of 8000 feet or more. The Longmynd beds are\r\nsucceeded by the so-called \"Menevian group,\" a series of sandstones,\r\nflags, and grits, about 600 feet in thickness, and containing\r\na considerable number of fossils. The _Upper Cambrian_ series\r\nconsists in its lower portion of nearly 5000 feet of strata,\r\nprincipally shaly and slaty, which are known as the \"Lingula\r\nFlags,\" from the great abundance in them of a shell referable\r\nto the genus _Lingula_. These are followed by 1000 feet of dark\r\nshales and flaggy sandstones, which are known as the \"Tremadoc\r\nslates,\" from their occurrence near Tremadoc in North Wales;\r\nand these in turn are surmounted, apparently quite conformably,\r\nby the basement beds of the Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 27. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE CAMBRIAN ROCKS\r\nIN WALES.]\r\n\r\nThe above may be regarded as giving a typical series of the Cambrian\r\nRocks in a typical locality; but strata of Cambrian age are known in\r\nmany other regions, of which it is only possible here to allude to\r\na few of the most important. In Scandinavia occurs a well-developed\r\nseries of Cambrian deposits, representing both the lower and\r\nupper parts of the formation. In Bohemia, the Upper Cambrian, in\r\nparticular, is largely developed, and constitutes the so-called\r\n\"Primordial zone\" of Barrande. Lastly, in North America, whilst the\r\nLower Cambrian is only imperfectly developed, or is represented by\r\nthe Huronian, the Upper Cambrian formation has a wide extension,\r\ncontaining fossils similar in character to the analogous strata\r\nin Europe, and known as the \"Potsdam Sandstone.\" The subjoined\r\ntable shows the chief areas where Cambrian Rocks are developed,\r\nand their general equivalency:\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF THE CAMBRIAN FORMATION.\r\n\r\n                  _Britain._    |      _Europe._      | _America._\r\n                                |                     |\r\n           /a.

Menevian Beds.   |                     |\r\n\r\nLike all the older Palæozoic deposits, the Cambrian Rocks, though\r\nby no means necessarily what would be called actually \"metamorphic,\"\r\nhave been highly cleaved, and otherwise altered from their original\r\ncondition. Owing partly to their indurated state, and partly to\r\ntheir great antiquity, they are usually found in the heart of\r\nmountainous districts, which have undergone great disturbance,\r\nand have been subjected to an enormous amount of denudation. In\r\nsome cases, as in the Longmynd Hills in Shropshire, they form\r\nlow rounded elevations, largely covered by pasture, and with few\r\nor no elements of sublimity. In other cases, however, they rise\r\ninto bold and rugged mountains, girded by precipitous cliffs.\r\nIndustrially, the Cambrian Rocks are of interest, if only for\r\nthe reason that the celebrated Welsh slates of Llanberis are\r\nderived from highly-cleaved beds of this age. Taken as a whole,\r\nthe Cambrian formation is essentially composed of arenaceous\r\nand muddy sediments, the latter being sometimes red, but more\r\ncommonly nearly black in colour. It has often been supposed that\r\nthe Cambrians are a deep-sea deposit, and that we may thus account\r\nfor the few fossils contained in them; but the paucity of fossils\r\nis to a large extent imaginary, and some of the Lower Cambrian\r\nbeds of the Longmynd Hills would appear to have been laid down\r\nin shallow water; as they exhibit rain-prints, sun-cracks, and\r\nripple-marks--incontrovertible evidence of their having been a\r\nshore-deposit. The occurrence, of innumerable worm-tracks and\r\nburrows in many Cambrian strata is also a proof of shallow-water\r\nconditions; and the general absence of limestones, coupled with\r\nthe coarse mechanical nature of many of the sediments of the\r\nLower Cambrian, maybe taken as pointing in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe _life_ of the Cambrian, though not so rich as in the succeeding\r\nSilurian period, nevertheless consists of representatives of\r\nmost of the great classes of invertebrate animals. The coarse\r\nsandy deposits of the formation, which abound more particularly\r\ntowards its lower part, naturally are to a large extent barren\r\nof fossils; but the muddy sediments, when not too highly cleaved,\r\nand especially towards the summit of the group, are replete with\r\norganic remains. This is also the case, in many localities at any\r\nrate, with the finer beds of the Potsdam Sandstone in America.\r\nLimestones are known to occur in only a few areas (chiefly in\r\nAmerica), and this may account for the apparent total absence\r\nof corals. It is, however, interesting to note that, with this\r\nexception, almost all the other leading groups of Invertebrates\r\nare known to have come into existence during the Cambrian period.\r\n\r\nFig. 28.--Fragment of _Eophyton Linneanum_, a supposed land-plant.\r\nLower Cambrian, Sweden, of the natural size.\r\n\r\nOf the land-surfaces of the Cambrian period we know nothing;\r\nand there is, therefore, nothing surprising in the fact that\r\nour acquaintance with the Cambrian vegetation is confined to\r\nsome marine plants or sea-weeds, often of a very obscure and\r\nproblematical nature. The \"Fucoidal Sandstone\" of Sweden, and the\r\n\"Potsdam Sandstone\" of North America, have both yielded numerous\r\nremains which have been regarded as markings left by sea-weeds or\r\n\"Fucoids;\" but these are highly enigmatical in their characters,\r\nand would, in many instances, seem to be rather referable to the\r\ntracks and burrows of marine worms. The first-mentioned of these\r\nformations has also yielded the curious, furrowed and striated\r\nstems which have been described as a kind of land-plant under\r\nthe name of _Eopkyton_ (fig. 28). It cannot be said, however,\r\nthat the vegetable origin of these singular bodies has been\r\nsatisfactorily proved. Lastly, there are found in certain green\r\nand purple beds of Lower Cambrian age at Bray Head, Wicklow,\r\nIreland, some very remarkable fossils, which are well known under\r\nthe name of _Oldhamia_, but the true nature of which is very\r\ndoubtful. The commonest form of _Oldhamia_ (fig. 29) consists of\r\na thread-like stem or axis, from which spring at regular intervals\r\nbundles of short filamentous branches in a fan-like manner. In\r\nthe locality where it occurs, the fronds of _Oldhamia_ are very\r\nabundant, and are spread over the surfaces of the strata in tangled\r\nlayers. That it is organic is certain, and that it is a calcareous\r\nsea-weed is probable; but it may possibly belong to the sea-mosses\r\n(_Polyzoa_), or to the sea-firs (_Sertularians_).\r\n\r\nAmongst the lower forms of animal life (_Protozoa_), we find the\r\nSponges represented by the curious bodies, composed of netted\r\nfibres, to which the name of _Protospongia_ has been given (fig.\r\n32, a); and the comparatively gigantic, conical, or cylindrical\r\nfossils termed _Archoeocyathus_ by Mr Billings are certainly\r\nreferable either to the _Foraminifera_ or to the Sponges. The\r\nalmost total absence of limestones in the formation may be regarded\r\nas a sufficient explanation of the fact that the _Foraminifera_\r\nare not more largely and unequivocally represented; though the\r\nexistence of greensands in the Cambrian beds of Wisconsin and\r\nTennessee may be taken as an indication that this class of animals\r\nwas by no means wholly wanting. The same fact may explain the\r\ntotal absence of corals, so far as at present known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--A portion of _Oldhamia antiqua_, Lower\r\nCambrian, Wicklow, Ireland, of the natural size. (After Salter.)]\r\n\r\nThe group of the _Echinodermata_ (Sea-lilies, Sea-urchins, and\r\ntheir allies) is represented by a few forms, which are principally\r\nof interest as being the earliest-known examples of the class.\r\nIt is also worthy of note that these precursors of a group which\r\nsubsequently attains such geological importance, are referable to\r\nno less than three distinct _orders_--the Crinoids or Sea-lilies,\r\nrepresented by a species of _Dendrocrinus_; the Cystideans by\r\n_Protocystites_; and the Star-fishes by _Palasterina_ and some\r\nother forms. Only the last of these groups, however, appears\r\nto occur in the Lower Cambrian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Annelide-burrows (_Scolithus linearus_)\r\nfrom the Potsdam Sandstone of Canada, of the natural size. (After\r\nBillings.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ringed-worms (_Annelida_), if rightly credited with all the\r\nremains usually referred to them, appear to have swarmed in the\r\nCambrian seas. Being soft-bodied, we do not find the actual worms\r\nthemselves in the fossil condition, but we have, nevertheless,\r\nabundant traces of their existence. In some cases we find vertical\r\nburrows of greater or less depth, often expanded towards their\r\napertures, in which the worm must have actually lived (fig. 30),\r\nas various species do at the present day. In these cases, the\r\ntube must have been rendered more or less permanent by receiving\r\na coating of mucus, or perhaps a genuine membranous secretion,\r\nfrom the body of the animal; and it may be found quite empty,\r\nor occupied by a cast of sand or mud. Of this nature are the\r\nburrows which have been described under the names of _Scolithus_\r\nand _Scolecoderma_, and probably the _Histioderma_ of the Lower\r\nCambrian of Ireland. In other cases, as in _Arenicolites_ (fig.\r\n32, b), the worm seems to have inhabited a double burrow, shaped\r\nlike the letter U, and having two openings placed close together\r\non the surface of the stratum. Thousands of these twin-burrows\r\noccur in some of the strata of the Longmynd, and it is supposed\r\nthat the worm used one opening to the burrow as an aperture of\r\nentrance, and the other as one of exit. In other cases, again,\r\nwe find simply the meandering trails caused by the worm dragging\r\nits body over the surface of the mud. Markings of this kind are\r\ncommoner in the Silurian Rocks, and it is generally more or less\r\ndoubtful whether they may not have been caused by other marine\r\nanimals, such as shellfish, whilst some of them have certainly\r\nnothing whatever to do with the worms. Lastly, the Cambrian beds\r\noften show twining cylindrical bodies, commonly more or less\r\nmatted together, and not confined to the surfaces of the strata,\r\nbut passing through them. These have often been regarded as the\r\nremains of sea-weeds, but it is more probable that they represent\r\ncasts of the underground burrows of worms of similar habits to\r\nthe common lob-worm (_Arenicola_) of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe _Articulate_ animals are numerously represented in the Cambrian\r\ndeposits, but exclusively by the class of _Crustaceans_. Some\r\nof these are little double-shelled creatures, resembling our\r\nliving water-fleas (_Ostracoda_). A few are larger forms, and\r\nbelong to the same group as the existing brine-shrimps and\r\nfairy-shrimps (_Phyllopoda_). One of the most characteristic of\r\nthese is the _Hymenocaris vermicauda_ of the Lingula Flags (fig.\r\n32, d). By far the larger number of the Cambrian _Crustacea_\r\nbelong, however, to the remarkable and wholly extinct group of\r\nthe _Trilobites_. These extraordinary animals must have literally\r\nswarmed in the seas of the later portion of this and the whole of\r\nthe succeeding period; and they survived in greatly diminished\r\nnumbers till the earlier portion of the Carboniferous period.\r\nThey died out, however, wholly before the close of the Palæozoic\r\nepoch, and we have no Crustaceans at the present day which can be\r\nconsidered as their direct representatives. They have, however,\r\nrelationships of a more or less intimate character with the existing\r\ngroups of the Phyllopods, the King-crabs (_Limulus_), and the\r\nIsopods (\"Slaters,\" Wood-lice, &c.) Indeed, one member of the\r\nlast-mentioned order, namely, the _Serolis_ of the coasts of\r\nPatagonia, has been regarded as the nearest living ally of the\r\nTrilobites. Be this as it may, the Trilobites possessed a skeleton\r\nwhich, though capable of undergoing almost endless variations,\r\nwas wonderfully constant in its pattern of structure, and we\r\nmay briefly describe here the chief features of this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Cambrian Trilobites: a, _Paradoxides\r\nBohemicus_, reduced in size; b, _Ellipsocephalus Hoffi_; c, _Sao\r\nhirsuta_; d, _Conocorypke Sultzeri_ (all the above, together with\r\nfig. g, are from the Upper Cambrian or \"Primordial Zone\" of\r\nBohemia); e, Head-shield of _Dikellocephalus Celticus_, from the\r\nLingula Flags of Wales; f, Head-shield of _Conocoryphe Matthewi_,\r\nfrom the Upper Cambrian (Acadian Group) of New Brunswick; g,\r\n_Agnostus rex_, Bohemia; h, Tail-shield of _Dikellocephalus\r\nMinnesotensis_, from the Upper Cambrian (Potsdam Sandstone) of\r\nMinnesota. (After Barrande, Dawson, Salter, and Dale Owen.)]\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the body of a Trilobite was defended by a\r\nstrong shell or \"crust,\" partly horny and partly calcareous in\r\nits composition. This shell (fig. 31) generally exhibits a very\r\ndistinct \"trilobation\" or division into three longitudinal lobes,\r\none central and two lateral. It also exhibits a more important and\r\nmore fundamental division into three transverse portions, which\r\nare so loosely connected with one another as very commonly to be\r\nfound separate. The first and most anterior of these divisions\r\nis a shield or buckler which covers the head; the second or middle\r\nportion is composed of movable rings covering the trunk (\"thorax\r\n\"); and the third is a shield which covers the tailor \"abdomen.\" The\r\nhead-shield (fig. 31, e) is generally more or less semicircular\r\nin shape; and its central portion, covering the stomach of the\r\nanimal, is usually strongly elevated, and generally marked by\r\nlateral furrows. A little on each side of the head are placed\r\nthe eyes, which are generally crescentic in shape, and resemble\r\nthe eyes of insects and many existing Crustaceans in being\r\n\"compound,\" or made up of numerous simple eyes aggregated together.\r\nSo excellent is the state of preservation of many specimens of\r\nTrilobites, that the numerous individual lenses of the eyes have\r\nbeen uninjured, and as many as four hundred have been counted\r\nin each eye of some forms. The eyes may be supported upon\r\nprominences, but they are never carried on movable stalks (as\r\nthey are in the existing lobsters and crabs); and in some of the\r\nCambrian Trilobites, such as the little _Agnosti_ (fig. 31 g),\r\nthe animal was blind. The lateral portions of the head-shield\r\nare usually separated from the central portion by a peculiar\r\nline of division (the so-called \"facial suture\") on each side;\r\nbut this is also wanting in some of the Cambrian species. The\r\nbackward angles of the head-shield, also, are often prolonged\r\ninto spines, which sometimes reach a great length. Following\r\nthe head-shield behind, we have a portion of the body which is\r\ncomposed of movable segments or \"body-rings,\" and which is\r\ntechnically called the \"thorax,\" Ordinarily, this region is strongly\r\ntrilobed, and each ring consists of a central convex portion,\r\nand of two flatter side-lobes. The number of body-rings in the\r\nthorax is very variable (from two to twenty-six), but is fixed\r\nfor the adult forms of each group of the Trilobites. The young\r\nforms have much fewer rings than the full-grown ones; and it\r\nis curious to find that the Cambrian Trilobites very commonly\r\nhave either a great many rings (as in _Paradoxides_, fig. 31,\r\na), or else very few (as in _Agnostus_, fig. 31, g). In some\r\ninstances, the body-rings do not seem to have been so constructed\r\nas to allow of much movement, but in other cases this region of\r\nthe body is so flexible that the animal possessed the power of\r\nrolling itself up completely, like a hedgehog; and many individuals\r\nhave been permanently preserved as fossils in this defensive\r\ncondition. Finally, the body of the Trilobite was completed by\r\na tail-shield (technically termed the \"pygidium\"), which varies\r\nmuch in size and form, and is composed of a greater or less number\r\nof rings, similar to those which form the thorax, but immovably\r\namalgamated with one another (fig. 31, h).\r\n\r\nThe under surface of the body in the Trilobites appears to have\r\nbeen more or less entirely destitute of hard structures, with the\r\nexception of a well-developed upper lip, in the form of a plate\r\nattached to the inferior side of the head-shield in front. There\r\nis no reason to doubt that the animal possessed legs; but these\r\nstructures seem to have resembled those of many living Crustaceans\r\nin being quite soft and membranous. This, at any rate, seems to\r\nhave been generally the case; though structures which have been\r\nregarded as legs have been detected on the under surface of one\r\nof the larger species of Trilobites. There is also, at present,\r\nno direct evidence that the Trilobites possessed the two pairs\r\nof jointed feelers (\"antennæ\") which are so characteristic of\r\nrecent Crustaceans.\r\n\r\nThe Trilobites vary much in size, and the Cambrian formation\r\npresents examples of both the largest and the smallest members\r\nof the order. Some of the young forms may be little bigger than\r\na millet-seed, and some adult examples of the smaller species\r\n(such as _Agnostus_) may be only a few lines in length; whilst\r\nsuch giants of the order as _Paradoxides_ and _Asaphus_ may reach\r\na length of from one to two feet. Judging from what we actually\r\nknow as to the structure of the Trilobites, and also from analogous\r\nrecent forms, it would seem that these ancient Crustaceans were\r\nmud-haunting creatures, denizens of shallow seas, and affecting\r\nthe soft silt of the bottom rather than the clear water above.\r\nWhenever muddy sediments are found in the Cambrian and Silurian\r\nformations, there we are tolerably sure to find Trilobites, though\r\nthey are by no means absolutely wanting in limestones. They appear\r\nto have crawled out upon the sea-bottom, or burrowed in the yielding\r\nmud, with the soft under surface directed downwards; and it is\r\nprobable that they really derived their nutriment from the organic\r\nmatter contained in the ooze amongst which they lived. The vital\r\norgans seem to have occupied the central lobe of the skeleton,\r\nby which they were protected; and a series of delicate leaf-like\r\npaddles, which probably served as respiratory organs, would appear\r\nto have been carried on the under surface of the thorax. That\r\nthey had their enemies may be regarded as certain; but we have\r\nno evidence that they were furnished with any offensive weapons,\r\nor, indeed, with any means of defence beyond their hard crust,\r\nand the power, possessed by so many of them, of rolling themselves\r\ninto a ball. An additional proof of the fact that they for the\r\nmost part crawled along the sea-bottom is found in the occurrence\r\nof tracks and markings of various kinds, which can hardly be\r\nascribed to any other creatures with any show of probability.\r\nThat this is the true nature of some of the markings in question\r\ncannot be doubted at all; and in other cases no explanation so\r\nprobable has yet been suggested. If, however, the tracks which have\r\nbeen described from the Potsdam Sandstone of North America under\r\nthe name of _Protichnites_ are really due to the peregrinations\r\nof some Trilobite, they must have been produced by one of the\r\nlargest examples of the order.\r\n\r\nAs already said, the Cambrian Rocks are very rich in the remains\r\nof Trilobites. In the lowest beds of the series (Longmynd Rocks),\r\nrepresentatives of some half-dozen genera have now been detected,\r\nincluding the dwarf _Agnostus_ and the giant _Paradoxides_. In\r\nthe higher beds, the number both of genera and species is largely\r\nincreased; and from the great comparative abundance of individuals,\r\nthe Trilobites have every right to be considered as the most\r\ncharacteristic fossils of the Cambrian period,--the more so as\r\nthe Cambrian species belong to peculiar types, which, for the\r\nmost part, died out before the commencement of the Silurian epoch.\r\n\r\nAll the remaining Cambrian fossils which demand any notice here\r\nare members of one or other division of the great class of the\r\n_Mollusca_, or \"Shell-fish\" properly so called. In the Lower\r\nCambrian Rocks the Lamp-shells (_Brachiopoda_) are the principal\r\nor sole representatives of the class, and appear chiefly in three\r\ninteresting and important types--namely, _Lingulella, Discina,_\r\nand _Obolella_. Of these the last (fig. 32, i) is highly\r\ncharacteristic of these ancient deposits; whilst _Discina_ is\r\none of those remarkable persistent types which, commencing at\r\nthis early period, has continued to be represented by varying\r\nforms through all the intervening geological formations up to the\r\npresent day. _Lingulella_ (fig. 32, c), again, is closely allied\r\nto the existing \"Goose-bill\" Lamp-shell (_Lingula anatina_), and\r\nthus presents us with another example of an extremely long-lived\r\ntype. The _Lingulelloe_ and their successors; the _Linguloe_, are\r\nsingular in possessing a shell which is of a horny texture, and\r\ncontains but a small proportion of calcareous matter. In the Upper\r\nCambrian Rocks, the _Lingulelloe_ become much more abundant, the\r\nbroad satchel-shaped species known as _L. Davisii_ (fig. 32,\r\ne) being so abundant that one of the great divisions of the\r\nCambrian is termed the \"Lingula Flags.\" Here, also, we meet for\r\nthe first time with examples of the genus Orthis (fig. 32, f,\r\nk, l) a characteristic Palæozoic type of the Brachiopods, which\r\nis destined to undergo a vast extension in later ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 32.--Cambrian Fossils: a, _Protospongia\r\nfenestrata_, Menevian Group; b, _Arenicolites didymus_, Longmynd\r\nGroup; c, _Lingulella ferruginea_, Longmynd and Menevian, enlarged;\r\nd, _Hymenocaris vermicauda_, Lingula Flags; e, _Lingulella Davisii_,\r\nLingula Flags; f, _Orthis lenticularis_, Lingula Flags; g, _Theca\r\nDavidii_, Tremadoc Slates; h, _Modiolopsis Solvensis_, Tremadoc\r\nSlates; i, _Obolela sagittalis_, interior of valve, Menevian;\r\nj, Exterior of the same; k, _Orthis Hicksii_, Menevian; l,\r\nCast of the same; m, _Olenus micrurus_, Lingula Flags. (Alter\r\nSalter, Hicks, and Davidson.)]\r\n\r\nOf the higher groups of the _Mollusca_ the record is as yet but\r\nscanty. In the Lower Cambrian, we have but the thin, fragile,\r\ndagger-shaped shells of the free-swimming oceanic Molluscs or\r\n\"Winged-snails\" (_Pteropoda_), of which the most characteristic\r\nis the genus _Theca_ (fig. 32, g). In the Upper Cambrian, in\r\naddition to these, we have a few Univalves (_Gasteropoda_), and,\r\nthanks to the researches of Dr Hicks, quite a small assemblage\r\nof Bivalves (_Lamellibranchiata_), though these are mostly of no\r\ngreat dimensions (fig. 32, h). Of the chambered _Cephalopoda_\r\n(Cuttle-fishes and their allies), we have but few traces; and these\r\nwholly confined to the higher beds of the formation. We meet,\r\nhowever, with examples of the wonderful genus _Orthoceras_, with\r\nits straight, partitioned shell, which we shall find in an immense\r\nvariety of forms in the Silurian rocks. Lastly, it is worthy of\r\nnote that the lowest of all the groups of the _Mollusca_--namely,\r\nthat of the Sea-mats, Sea-mosses, and Lace-corals (_Polyzoa_)--is\r\nonly doubtfully known to have any representatives in the Cambrian,\r\nthough undergoing a large and varied development in the Silurian\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Fragment of _Dictyonema sociale_,\r\nconsiderably enlarged, showing the horny branches, with their\r\nconnecting cross-bars, and with a row of cells on each side.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nAn exception, however, may with much probability be made to this\r\nstatement in favour of the singular genus _Dictyonema_ (fig.\r\n33), which is highly characteristic of the highest Cambrian beds\r\n(Tremadoc Slates). This curious fossil occurs in the form of\r\nfan-like or funnel-shaped expansions, composed of slightly-diverging\r\nhorny branches, which are united in a net-like manner by numerous\r\ndelicate cross-bars, and exhibit a row of little cups or cells,\r\nin which the animals were contained, on each side. _Dictyonema_\r\nhas generally been referred to the _Graptolites_; but it has a\r\nmuch greater affinity with the plant-like Sea-firs (_Sertularians_)\r\nor the Sea-mosses (_Polyzoa_), and the balance of evidence is\r\nperhaps in favour of placing it with the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following are the more important and accessible works and\r\nmemoirs which may be consulted in studying the stratigraphical\r\nand palæontological relations of the Cambrian Rocks:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Siluria.'

Amongst these latter\r\nmay be mentioned memoirs by Prof. Phillips, and Messrs Salter,\r\nHicks, Belt, Plant, Homfray, Ash, Holl, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE LOWER SILURIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe great system of deposits to which Sir Roderick Murchison\r\napplied the name of \"Silurian Rocks\" reposes directly upon the\r\nhighest Cambrian beds, apparently without any marked unconformity,\r\nthough with a considerable change in the nature of the fossils. The\r\nname \"Silurian\" was originally proposed by the eminent geologist\r\njust alluded to for a great series of strata lying below the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, and occupying districts in Wales and its borders\r\nwhich were at one time inhabited by the \"Silures,\" a tribe of\r\nancient Britons. Deposits of a corresponding age are now known\r\nto be largely developed in other parts of England, in Scotland,\r\nand in Ireland, in North America, in Australia, in India, in\r\nBohemia, Saxony, Bavaria, Russia, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and\r\nin various other regions of less note. In some regions, as in\r\nthe neighbourhood of St Petersburg, the Silurian strata are found\r\nnot only to have preserved their original horizontality, but\r\nalso to have retained almost unaltered their primitive soft and\r\nincoherent nature. In other regions, as in Scandinavia and many\r\nparts of North America, similar strata, now consolidated into\r\nshales, sandstones, and limestones, may be found resting with\r\na very slight inclination on still older sediments. In a great\r\nmany regions, however, the Silurian deposits are found to have\r\nundergone more or less folding, crumpling, and dislocation,\r\naccompanied by induration and \"cleavage\" of the finer and softer\r\nsediments; whilst in some regions, as in the Highlands of Scotland,\r\nactual \"metamorphism\" has taken place. In consequence of the\r\nabove, Silurian districts usually present the bold, rugged, and\r\npicturesque outlines which are characteristic of the older\r\n\"Primitive\" rocks of the earth's crust in general. In many instances,\r\nwe find Silurian strata rising into mountain-chains of great\r\ngrandeur and sublimity, exhibiting the utmost diversity of which\r\nrock-scenery is capable, and delighting the artist with endless\r\nchanges of valley, lake, and cliff. Such districts are little\r\nsuitable for agriculture, though this is often compensated for\r\nby the valuable mineral products contained in the rocks. On the\r\nother hand, when the rocks are tolerably soft and uniform in\r\ntheir nature, or when few disturbances of the crust of the earth\r\nhave taken place, we may find Silurian areas to be covered with\r\nan abundant pasturage or to be heavily timbered.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Silurian Rocks,\" Sir Roderick Murchison included\r\nall the strata between the summit of the \"Longmynd.\" beds and the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, and he divided these into the two great groups\r\nof the _Lower_ Silurian and _Upper_ Silurian. It is, however, now\r\ngenerally admitted that a considerable portion of the basement\r\nbeds of Murchison's Silurian series must be transferred---if only\r\nupon palæontological grounds--to the Upper Cambrian, as has here\r\nbeen done; and much controversy has been carried on as to the proper\r\nnomenclature of the Upper Silurian and of the remaining portion\r\nof Murchison's Lower Silurian. Thus, some would confine the name\r\n\"Silurian\" exclusively to the Upper Silurian, and would apply the\r\nname of \"Cambro-Silurian\" to the Lower Silurian, or would include\r\nall beds of the latter age in the \"Cambrian\" series of Sedgwick.\r\nIt is not necessary to enter into the merits of these conflicting\r\nviews. For our present purpose, it is sufficient to recognise\r\nthat there exist two great groups of rocks between the highest\r\nCambrian beds, as here defined, and the base of the Devonian or\r\nOld Red Sandstone. These two great groups are so closely allied\r\nto one another, both physically and palæontologically, that many\r\nauthorities have established a third or intermediate group (the\r\n\"Middle Silurian\"), by which a passage is made from one into\r\nthe other. This method of procedure involves disadvantages which\r\nappear to outweigh its advantages; and the two groups in question\r\nare not only generally capable of very distinct stratigraphical\r\nseparation, but at the same time exhibit, together with the alliances\r\nabove spoken of, so many and such important palæontological\r\ndifferences, that it is best to consider them separately. We\r\nshall therefore follow this course in the present instance; and\r\npending the final solution of the controversy as to Cambrian and\r\nSilurian nomenclature, we shall distinguish these two groups\r\nof strata as the \"Lower Silurian\" and the \"Upper Silurian.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lower Silurian Rocks_ are known already to be developed\r\nin various regions; and though their _general_ succession in\r\nthese areas is approximately the same, each area exhibits\r\npeculiarities of its own, whilst the subdivisions of each are\r\nknown by special names. All, therefore, that can be attempted\r\nhere, is to select two typical areas--such as Wales and North\r\nAmerica and to briefly consider the grouping and divisions of\r\nthe Lower Silurian in each.\r\n\r\nIn Wales, the line between the Cambrian and Lower Silurian is\r\nsomewhat ill-defined, and is certainly not marked by any strong\r\nunconformity. There are, however; grounds for accepting the line\r\nproposed, for palæontological reasons, by Dr Hicks, in accordance\r\nwith which the Tremadoc Slates (\"Lower Tremadoc\" of Salter) become\r\nthe highest of the Cambrian deposits of Britain. If we take this\r\nview, the Lower Silurian rocks of Wales and adjoining districts\r\nare found to have the following _general_ succession from below\r\nupwards (fig. 34):--\r\n\r\n1. The _Arenig Group_.--This group derives its name from the\r\nArenig mountains, where it is extensively developed. It consists\r\nof about 4000 feet of slates, shales, and flags, and is divisible\r\ninto a lower, middle, and upper division, of which the former\r\nis often regarded as Cambrian under the name of \"Upper Tremadoc\r\nSlates.\"\r\n\r\n2. The _Llandeilo Group_.--The thickness of this group varies\r\nfrom about 4000 to as much as 10,000 feet; but in this latter\r\ncase a great amount of the thickness is made up of volcanic ashes\r\nand interbedded traps. The sedimentary beds of this group are\r\nprincipally slates and flags, the latter occasionally with calcareous\r\nbands; and the whole series can be divided into a lower, middle,\r\nand upper Llandeilo division, of which the last is the most\r\nimportant. The name of \"Llandeilo\" is derived from the town of\r\nthe same name in Wales, where strata of this age were described\r\nby Murchison.\r\n\r\n3. The _Caradoc_ or _Bala Group_.--The alternative names of this\r\ngroup are also of local origin, and are derived, the one from\r\nCaer Caradoc in Shropshire, the other from Bala in Wales, strata\r\nof this age occurring in both localities. The series is divided\r\ninto a lower and upper group, the latter chiefly composed of\r\nshales and flags, and the former of sandstones and shales, together\r\nwith the important and interesting calcareous band known as the\r\n\"Bala Limestone.\" The thickness of the entire series varies from\r\n4000 to as much as 12,000 feet, according as it contains more\r\nor less of interstratified igneous rocks.\r\n\r\n4. The _Llandovery Group_ (Lower Llandovery of Murchison).--This\r\nseries, as developed near the town of Llandovery, in\r\nCaermarthenshire, consists of less than 1000 feet of conglomerates,\r\nsandstones, and shales. It is probable, however, that the little\r\ncalcareous band known as the \"Hirnant Limestone,\" together with\r\ncertain pale-coloured slates which lie above the Bala Limestone,\r\nthough usually referred to the Caradoc series, should in reality\r\nbe regarded as belonging to the Llandovery group.\r\n\r\nThe general succession of the Lower Silurian strata of Wales\r\nand its borders, attaining a maximum thickness (along with\r\ncontemporaneous igneous matter) of nearly 30,000 feet, is\r\ndiagramatically represented in the annexed sketch-section (fig.\r\n34):--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 34. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE LOWER SILURIAN\r\nROCKS OF WALES.]\r\n\r\nIn North America, both in the United States and in Canada, the\r\nSilurian rocks are very largely developed, and may be regarded\r\nas constituting an exceedingly full and typical series of the\r\ndeposits of this period. The chief groups of the Silurian rocks\r\nof North America are as follows, beginning, as before, with the\r\nlowest strata, and proceeding upwards (fig. 35):--\r\n\r\n1. _Quebec Group_.--This group is typically developed in the\r\nvicinity of Quebec, where it consists of about 5000 feet of strata,\r\nchiefly variously-coloured shales, together with some sandstones\r\nand a few calcareous bands. It contains a number of peculiar\r\nGraptolites, by which it can be identified without question with\r\nthe Arenig group of Wales and the corresponding Skiddaw Slates\r\nof the North of England. It is also to be noted that numerous\r\nTrilobites of a distinct Cambrian _facies_ have been obtained in\r\nthe limestones of the Quebec group, near Quebec. These fossils,\r\nhowever, have been exclusively obtained from the limestones of\r\nthe group; and as these limestones are principally calcareous\r\nbreccias or conglomerates, there is room for believing that these\r\nprimordial fossils are really derived, in part at any rate, from\r\nfragments of an upper Cambrian limestone. In the State of New\r\nYork, the Graptolitic shales of Quebec are wanting; and the base\r\nof the Silurian is constituted by the so-called \"Calciferous\r\nSand-rock\" and \"Chazy Limestone.\"[11] The first of these is\r\nessentially and typically calcareous, and the second is a genuine\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The precise relations of the Quebec shales with\r\nGraptolites (Levis Formation) to the Calciferous and Chazy beds\r\nare still obscure, though there seems little doubt but that the\r\nQuebec Shales are superior to the Calciferous Sand-rock.]\r\n\r\n2. The _Trenton Group_.--This is an essentially calcareous group,\r\nthe various limestones of which it is composed being known as\r\nthe \"Bird's-eye,\" \"Black River,\" and \"Trenton\" Limestones, of\r\nwhich the last is the thickest and most important. The thickness\r\nof this group is variable, and the bands of limestone in it are\r\noften separated by beds of shale.\r\n\r\n3. The _Cincinnati Group_ (Hudson River Formation[12]).--This\r\ngroup consists essentially of a lower series of shales, often\r\nblack in colour and highly charged with bituminous matter (the\r\n\"Utica Slates \"), and of an upper series of shales, sandstones, and\r\nlimestones (the \"Cincinnati\" rocks proper). The exact parallelism\r\nof the Trenton and Cincinnati groups with the subdivisions of the\r\nWelsh Silurian series can hardly be stated positively. Probably\r\nno precise equivalency exists; but there can be no doubt but that\r\nthe Trenton and Cincinnati groups correspond, as a whole, with the\r\nLlandeilo and Caradoc groups of Britain. The subjoined diagrammatic\r\nsection (fig. 35) gives a general idea of the succession of the\r\nLower Silurian rocks of North America:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 35. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE LOWER SILURIAN\r\nROCKS OF NORTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--_Licrophycus Ottawaensis_ a \"Fucoid,\"\r\nfrom the Trenton Limestone (Lower Silurian) of Canada. (After\r\nBillings.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: There is some difficulty about the precise nomenclature\r\nof this group. It was originally called the \"Hudson River Formation;\"\r\nbut this name is inappropriate, as rocks of this age hardly touch\r\nanywhere the actual Hudson River itself, the rocks so called\r\nformerly being now known to be of more ancient date. There is\r\nalso some want of propriety in the name of \"Cincinnati Group,\"\r\nsince the rocks which are known under this name in the vicinity of\r\nCincinnati itself are the representatives of the Trenton Limestone,\r\nUtica Slates, and the old Hudson River group, inseparably united\r\nin what used to be called the \"Blue Limestone Series.\"].\r\n\r\nOf the _life_ of the Lower Silurian period we have record in\r\na vast number of fossils, showing that the seas of this period\r\nwere abundantly furnished with living denizens. We have, however,\r\nin the meanwhile, no knowledge of the land-surfaces of the period.\r\nWe have therefore no means of speculating as to the nature of\r\nthe terrestrial animals of this ancient age, nor is anything\r\nknown with certainty of any land-plants which may have existed.\r\nThe only relics of vegetation upon which a positive opinion can\r\nbe expressed belong to the obscure group of the \"Fucoids,\" and\r\nare supposed to be the remains of sea-weeds. Some of the fossils\r\nusually placed under this head are probably not of a vegetable\r\nnature at all, but others (fig. 36) appear to be unquestionable\r\nplants. The true affinities of these, however, are extremely\r\ndubious. All that can be said is, that remains which appear to\r\nbe certainly vegetable, and which are most probably due to marine\r\nplants, have been recognised nearly at the base of the Lower\r\nSilurian (Arenig), and that they are found throughout the series\r\nwhenever suitable conditions recur.\r\n\r\nThe Protozoans appear to have flourished extensively in the Lower\r\nSilurian seas, though to a large extent under forms which are\r\nstill little understood. We have here for the first time the\r\nappearance of Foraminifera of the ordinary type--one of the most\r\ninteresting observations in this collection being that made by\r\nEhrenberg, who showed that the Lower Silurian sandstones of the\r\nneighbourhood of St Petersburg contained casts in glauconite of\r\nForaminiferous shells, some of which are referable to the existing\r\ngenera _Rotalia_ and _Texularia_. True _Sponges_, belonging to\r\nthat section of the group in which the skeleton is calcareous,\r\nare also not unknown, one of the most characteristic genera being\r\n_Astylospongia_ (fig. 37). In this genus are included more or\r\nless globular, often lobed sponges, which are believed not to\r\nhave been attached to foreign bodies. In the form here figured\r\nthere is a funnel-shaped cavity at the summit; and the entire\r\nmass of the sponge is perforated, as in living examples, by a\r\nsystem of canals which convey the sea-water to all parts of the\r\norganism. The canals by which the sea-water gains entrance open\r\non the exterior of the sphere, and those by which it again escapes\r\nfrom the sponge open into the cup-shaped depression at the summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--_Astylospongia proemorsa_, cut vertically\r\nso as to exhibit the canal-system in the interior. Lower Silurian,\r\nTennessee. (After Ferdinand Roemer.)]\r\n\r\nThe most abundant, and at the same time the least understood,\r\nof Lower Silurian Protozoans belong, however, to the genera\r\n_Stromatopora_ and _Receptaculites_, the structure of which can\r\nmerely be alluded to here. The specimens of _Stromatopora_ (fig.\r\n38) occur as hemispherical, pear-shaped, globular, or irregular\r\nmasses, often of very considerable size, and sometimes demonstrably\r\nattached to foreign bodies. In their structure these masses consist\r\nof numerous thin calcareous laminæ, usually arranged concentrically,\r\nand separated by narrow interspaces. These interspaces are generally\r\ncrossed by numerous vertical calcareous pillars, giving the vertical\r\nsection of the fossil a lattice-like appearance. There are also\r\nusually minute pores in the concentric laminæ, by which the\r\nsuccessive interspaces are placed in communication; and sometimes\r\nthe surface presents large rounded openings, which appear to\r\ncorrespond with the water-canals of the Sponges. Upon the whole,\r\nthough presenting some curious affinities to the calcareous Sponges,\r\n_Stromatopora_ is perhaps more properly regarded as a gigantic\r\n_Foraminifer_. If this view be correct, it is of special interest\r\nas being probably the nearest ally of _Eozoön_, the general\r\nappearance of the two being strikingly similar, though their\r\nminute structure is not at all the same. Lastly, in the fossils\r\nknown as _Receptaculites_ and _Ischadites_ we are also presented\r\nwith certain singular Lower Silurian Protozoans, which may with\r\ngreat probability be regarded as gigantic _Foraminifera_. Their\r\nstructure is very complex; but fragments are easily recognised\r\nby the fact that the exterior is covered with numerous rhomboidal\r\ncalcareous plates, closely fitting together, and arranged in\r\npeculiar intersecting curves, presenting very much the appearance\r\nof the engine-turned case of a watch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--A small and perfect specimen of\r\n_Stromatopora rugosa_, of the natural size, from the Trenton\r\nLimestone of Canada. (After Billings.)]\r\n\r\nPassing next to the sub-kingdom of _Coelenterate_ animals (Zoophytes,\r\nCorals, &c.), we find that this great group, almost or wholly\r\nabsent in the Cambrian, is represented in Lower Silurian deposits\r\nby a great number of forms belonging on the one hand to the true\r\nCorals, and en the other hand to the singular family of the\r\n_Graptolites_. If we except certain plant-like fossils which\r\nprobably belong rather to the Sertularians or the Polyzoans (e.g.,\r\n_Dictyonema, Dendrograptus_, &c.), the family of the _Graptolites_\r\nmay be regarded as exclusively Silurian in its distribution. Not\r\nonly is this the case, but it attained its maximum development\r\nalmost upon its first appearance, in the Arenig Rocks; and whilst\r\nrepresented by a great variety of types in the Lower Silurian;\r\nit only exists in the Upper Silurian in a much diminished form.\r\nThe _Graptolites_ (Gr. _grapho_, I write; _lithos_, stone) were\r\nso named by Linnæus, from the resemblance of some of them to\r\nwritten or pencilled marks upon the stone, though the great\r\nnaturalist himself did not believe them to be true fossils at\r\nall. They occur as linear or leaf-like bodies, sometimes simple,\r\nsometimes compound and branched; and no doubt whatever can be\r\nentertained as to their being the skeletons of composite organisms,\r\nor colonies of semi-independent animals united together by a common\r\nfleshy trunk, similar to what is observed in the colonies of the\r\nexisting Sea-firs (Sertularians). This fleshy trunk or common\r\nstem of the colony was protected by a delicate horny sheath, and\r\nit gave origin to the little flower-like \"polypites,\" which\r\nconstituted the active element of the whole assemblage. These\r\nsemi-independent beings were, in turn, protected each by a little\r\nhorny cup or cell, directly connected with the common sheath\r\nbelow, and terminating above in an opening through which the\r\npolypite could protrude its tentacled head or could again withdraw\r\nitself for safety. The entire skeleton, again, was usually, if\r\nnot universally, supported by a delicate horny rod or \"axis,\"\r\nwhich appears to have been hollow, and which often protrudes to\r\na greater or less extent beyond one or both of the extremities\r\nof the actual colony.\r\n\r\nThe above gives the elementary constitution of any _Graptolite_,\r\nbut there are considerable differences as to the manner in which\r\nthese elements are arranged and combined. In some forms the common\r\nstem of the colony gives origin to but a single row of cells\r\non one side. If the common stem is a simple, straight, or\r\nslightly-curved linear body, then we have the simplest form of\r\nGraptolite known (the genus _Monograptus_); and it is worthy of\r\nnote that these simple types do not come into existence till\r\ncomparatively late (Llandeilo), and last nearly to the very close\r\nof the Upper Silurian. In other cases, whilst there is still but\r\na single row of cells, the colony may consist of two of these\r\nsimple stems springing from a common point, as in the so-called\r\n\"twin Graptolites\" (_Didymograptus_, fig. 40). This type is entirely\r\nconfined to the earlier portion of the Lower Silurian period\r\n(Arenig and Llandeilo). In other cases, again, there may be four\r\nof such stems springing from a central point (_Tetragraptus_).\r\nLastly, there are numerous complex forms (such as _Dichograptus,\r\nLoganograptus_, &c.) in which there are eight or more of these\r\nsimple branches, all arising from a common centre (fig. 39),\r\nwhich is sometimes furnished with a singular horny disc. These\r\ncomplicated branching forms, as well as the _Tetragrapti_, are\r\ncharacteristic of the horizon of the Arenig group. Similar forms,\r\noften specifically identical, are found at this horizon in Wales,\r\nin the great series of the Skiddaw Slates of the north of England,\r\nin the Quebec group in Canada, in equivalent beds in Sweden, and\r\nin certain gold-bearing slates of the same age in Victoria in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--_Dichograptus octobrachiatus_, a branched,\r\n\"unicellular\" Graptolite from the Skiddaw and Quebec Groups (Arenig).\r\n(After Hall.)]\r\n\r\nIn another great group of Graptolites (including the genera\r\n_Diplograptus, Dicranograptus, Climacograptus_, &c.) the common\r\nstem of the colony gives origin, over part or the whole or its\r\nlength, to _two_ rows of cells, one on each side (fig. 41). These\r\n\"double-celled\" Graptolites are highly characteristic of the Lower\r\nSilurian deposits; and, with an exception more apparent than real\r\nin Bohemia, they are exclusively confined to strata of Lower\r\nSilurian age, and are not known to occur in the Upper Silurian.\r\nLastly, there is a group of Graptolites (_Phyllograptus_, fig.\r\n42) in which the colony is leaf-like in form, and is composed\r\nof _four_ rows of cells springing in a cross-like manner from\r\nthe common stem. These forms are highly characteristic of the\r\nArenig group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Central portion of the colony of\r\n_Didymegraptus divaricatus_, Upper Llandeilo, Dumfresshire.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Examples of _Diplograptus pristis_,\r\nshowing variations in the appendages at the base. Upper Llandeilo,\r\nDumfriesshire. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Group of individuals of _Phyllograptus\r\ntypus_, from the Quebec group of Canada. (After Hall.) One of\r\nthe four rows of cells is hidden on the under surface.]\r\n\r\nThe Graptolites are usually found in dark-coloured, often black\r\nshales, which sometimes contain so much carbon as to become\r\n\"anthracitic.\" They may be simply carbonaceous; but they are\r\nmore commonly converted into iron-pyrites, when they glitter\r\nwith the brilliant lustre of silver as they lie scattered on the\r\nsurface of the rock, fully deserving in their metallic tracery\r\nthe name of \"written stones.\" They constitute one of the most\r\nimportant groups of Silurian fossils, and are of the greatest\r\nvalue in determining the precise stratigraphical position of\r\nthe beds in which they occur. They present, however, special\r\ndifficulties in their study; and it is still a moot point as\r\nto their precise position in the zoological scale. The balance\r\nof evidence is in favour of regarding them as an ancient and\r\npeculiar group of the Sea-firs (Hydroid Zoophytes), but some\r\nregard them as belonging rather to the Sea-mosses (_Polyzoa_).\r\nUnder any circumstances, they cannot be directly compared either\r\nwith the ordinary Sea-firs or the ordinary Sea-mosses; for these\r\ntwo groups consist of fixed organisms, whereas the Graptolites\r\nwere certainly free-floating creatures, living at large in the\r\nopen sea. The only Hydroid Zoophytes or Polyzoans which have\r\na similar free mode of existence, have either no skeleton at\r\nall, or have hard structures quite unlike the horny sheaths of\r\nthe Graptolites.\r\n\r\nThe second great group of Coelenterate animals (_Actinozoa_)\r\nis represented in the Lower Silurian rocks by numerous Corals.\r\nThese, for obvious reasons, are much more abundant in regions\r\nwhere the Lower Silurian series is largely calcareous (as in\r\nNorth America) than in districts like Wales, where limestones\r\nare very feebly developed. The Lower Silurian Corals, though\r\nthe first of their class, and presenting certain peculiarities,\r\nmay be regarded as essentially similar in nature to existing\r\nCorals. These, as is well known, are the calcareous skeletons of\r\nanimals--the so-called \"Coral-Zoophytes\"--closely allied to the\r\ncommon Sea-anemones in structure and habit. A _simple_ coral (fig.\r\n43) consists of a calcareous cup embedded in the soft tissues of\r\nthe flower-like polype, and having at its summit a more or less\r\ndeep depression (the \"calice\") in which the digestive organs\r\nare contained. The space within the coral is divided into\r\ncompartments by numerous vertical calcareous plates (the \"septa\"),\r\nwhich spring from the inside of the wall of the cup, and of which\r\nsome generally reach the centre. _Compound_ corals, again (fig.\r\n44), consist of a greater or less number of structures similar\r\nin structure to the above, but united together in different ways\r\ninto a common mass. _Simple_ corals, therefore, are the skeletons\r\nof _single_ and independent polypes; whilst _compound_ corals\r\nare the skeletons of assemblages or colonies of similar polypes,\r\nliving united with one another another as an organic community.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--_Zaphrentis Stokesi_, a simple \"cup-coral,\"\r\nUpper Silurian, Canada. (After Billings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Upper surface of a mass of _Strombodes\r\npentagonus_. Upper Silurian, Canada. (After Billings.)]\r\n\r\nIn the general details of their structure, the Lower Silurian\r\nCorals do not differ from the ordinary Corals of the present\r\nday. The latter, however, have the vertical calcareous plates\r\nof the coral (\"septa\") arranged in multiples of six or five;\r\nwhereas the former have these structures arranged in multiples\r\nof four, and often showing a cross-like disposition. For this\r\nreason, the common Lower Silurian Corals are separated to form\r\na distinct group under the name of _Rugose_ Corals or _Rugosa_.\r\nThey are further distinguished by the fact that the cavity of\r\nthe coral (\"visceral chamber\") is usually subdivided by more\r\nor less numerous horizontal calcareous plates or partitions,\r\nwhich divide the coral into so many tiers or storeys, and which\r\nare known as the \"tabulæ\" (fig. 45).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--_Columnaria alveolata_, a Rugose compound\r\ncoral, with imperfect septa, but having the corallites partitioned\r\noff into storeys by \"tabulæ.\" Lower Silurian, Canada. (After\r\nBillings.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Rugose Corals, the Lower Silurian rocks contain\r\na number of curious compound corals, the tubes of which have\r\neither no septa at all or merely rudimentary ones, but which\r\nhave the transverse partitions or \"tabulæ\" very highly developed.\r\nThese are known as the _Tabulate Corals_; and recent researches\r\non some of their existing allies (such as _Heliopora_) have shown\r\nthat they are really allied to the modern Sea-pens, Organ-pipe\r\nCorals, and Red Coral, rather than to the typical stony Corals.\r\nAmongst the characteristic Rugose Corals of the Lower Silurian\r\nmay be mentioned species belonging to the genera _Columnaria,\r\nFavistella, Streptelasma_, and _Zaphrentis_; whilst amongst the\r\n\"Tabulate\" Corals, the principal forms belong to the genera\r\n_Choetetes, Halysites_ (the Chain-coral), _Constellaria_, and\r\n_Heliolites_. These groups of the Corals, however, attain a greater\r\ndevelopment at a later period, and they will be noticed more\r\nparticularly hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Group of Cystideans. A, _Caryocrinus\r\nornatus_,[13] Upper Silurian, America; B, _Pleurocystites squamosus_,\r\nshowing two short \"arms,\" Lower Silurian, Canada; C, _Pseudocrinus\r\nbifasciatus_, Upper Silurian, England; D, _Lepadocrinus Gebhartii_,\r\nUpper Silurian, America. (After Hall, Billings, and Salter.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The genus _Caryocrinus_ is sometimes regarded as\r\nproperly belonging to the _Crinoids_, but there seem to be good\r\nreasons for rather considering it as an abnormal form of\r\n_Cystidean_.]\r\n\r\nPassing onto higher animals, we find that the class of the\r\n_Echinodermata_ is represented by examples of the Star-fishes\r\n(_Asteroidea_), the Sea-lilies (_Crinoidea_), and the peculiar\r\nextinct group of the Cystideans (_Cystoidea_), with one or two of\r\nthe Brittle-stars (_Ophiuroidea_)--the Sea-urchins (_Echinoidea_)\r\nbeing still wanting. The Crinoids, though in some places extremely\r\nnumerous, have not the varied development that they possess in\r\nthe Upper Silurian, in connection with which their structure will\r\nbe more fully spoken of. In the meanwhile, it is sufficient to\r\nnote that many of the calcareous deposits of the Lower Silurian\r\nare strictly entitled to the name of \"Crinoidal limestones,\"\r\nbeing composed in great part of the detached joints, and plates,\r\nand broken stems, of these beautiful but fragile organisms (see\r\nfig. 12). Allied to the Crinoids are the singular creatures which\r\nare known as _Cystideans_ (fig. 46). These are generally composed\r\nof a globular or ovate body (the \"calyx\"), supported upon a short\r\nstalk (the \"column\"), by which the organism was usually attached\r\nto some foreign body. The body was enclosed by closely-fitting\r\ncalcareous plates, accurately jointed together; and the stem was\r\nmade up of numerous distinct pieces or joints, flexibly united\r\nto each other by membrane. The chief distinction which strikes\r\none in comparing the Cystideans with the Crinoids is, that the\r\nlatter are always furnished, as will be subsequently seen, with\r\na beautiful crown of branched and feathery appendages, springing\r\nfrom the summit of the calyx, and which are composed of innumerable\r\ncalcareous plates or joints, and are known as the \"arms.\" In the\r\nCystideans, on the other hand, there are either no \"arms\" at all,\r\nor merely short, unbranched, rudimentary arms. The Cystideans are\r\nprincipally, and indeed nearly exclusively, Silurian fossils;\r\nand though occurring in the Upper Silurian in no small numbers,\r\nthey are pre-eminently characteristic of the Llandeilo-Caradoc\r\nperiod of Lower Silurian time. They commenced their existence,\r\nso far as known, in the Upper Cambrian; and though examples are\r\nnot absolutely unknown in later periods, they are pre-eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the earlier portion of the Palæozoic epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Lower Silurian Crustaceans. a, _Asaphus\r\ntyrannus_, Upper Llandeilo; b. _Ogygia Buchii_, Upper Llandeilo;\r\nc, _Trinucleus concentricus_, Caradoc; d, _Caryocaris Wrightii_,\r\nArenig (Skiddaw Slates); e, _Beyrichia complicata_, natural size and\r\nenlarged, Upper Llandeilo and Caradoc; f, _Primitia strangulata_,\r\nCaradoc: g.

(After\r\nSalter, M'Coy, Rupert Jones, and Dana.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ringed Worms (_Annelides_) are abundantly represented in the\r\nLower Silurian, but principally by tracks and burrows similar\r\nin essential respects to those which occur so commonly in the\r\nCambrian formation, and calling for no special comment. Much more\r\nimportant are the _Articulate_ animals, represented as heretofore,\r\nwholly by the remains of the aquatic group of the _Crustaceans_.\r\nAmongst these are numerous little bivalved forms--such as species\r\nof _Primitia_ (fig. 47, f), _Beyrichia_ (fig. 47, e), and\r\n_Leperditia_ (fig. 47, i and j). Most of these are very small,\r\nvarying from the size of a pin's head up to that of a hemp seed;\r\nbut they are sometimes as large as a small bean (fig. 47, i),\r\nand they are commonly found in myriads together in the rock. As\r\nbefore said, they belong to the same great group as the living\r\nWater-fleas (_Ostracoda_). Besides these, we find the pod-shaped\r\nhead-shields of the shrimp-like Phyllopods--such as _Caryocaris_\r\n(fig. 47, d) and _Ceratiocaris_. More important, however, than\r\nany of these are the _Trilobites_, which may be considered as\r\nattaining their maximum development in the Lower Silurian. The\r\nhuge _Paradoxides_ of the Cambrian have now disappeared, and with\r\nthem almost all the principal and characteristic \"primordial\"\r\ngenera, save _Olenus_ and _Agnostus_. In their place we have a\r\ngreat number of new forms--some of them, like the great _Asaphus\r\ntyrannus_ of the Upper Llandeilo (fig. 47, a), attaining a\r\nlength of a foot or more, and thus hardly yielding in the matter\r\nof size to their ancient rivals. Almost every subdivision of the\r\nLower Silurian series has its own special and characteristic\r\nspecies of Trilobites; and the study of these is therefore of\r\ngreat importance to the geologist. A few widely-dispersed and\r\ncharacteristic species have been here figured (fig. 47); and\r\nthe following may be considered as the principal Lower Silurian\r\ngenera--_Asaphus, Ogygia, Cheirurus, Ampyx, Caiymene, Trinucleus,\r\nLichas, Illoenus, Æglina, Harpes, Remopleurides, Phacops, Acidaspis_,\r\nand _Homalonotus_, a few of them passing upwards under new forms\r\ninto the Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\nComing next to the _Mollusca_, we find the group of the Sea-mosses\r\nand Sea-mats (_Polyzoa_) represented now by quite a number of forms.\r\nAmongst these are examples of the true Lace-corals (_Retepora_\r\nand _Fenestella_), with their netted fan-like or funnel-shaped\r\nfronds; and along with these are numerous delicate encrusting\r\nforms, which grew parasitically attached to shells and corals\r\n(_Hippothoa, Alecto_, &c.); but perhaps the most characteristic\r\nforms belong to the genus _Ptilodictya_ (figs. 48 and 49). In\r\nthis group the frond is flattened, with thin striated edges,\r\nsometimes sword-like or scimitar-shaped, but often more or less\r\nbranched; and it consists of two layers of cells, separated by\r\na delicate membrane, and opening upon opposite sides. Each of\r\nthese little chambers or \"cells\" was originally tenanted by a\r\nminute animal, and the whole thus constituted a compound organism\r\nor colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--_Ptilodictya falciformis_. a, Small\r\nspecimen of the natural size; b, Cross-section, showing the\r\nshape of the frond; c, Portion of the surface, enlarged.

(After Meek, Hall, and Salter.)]\r\n\r\nThe Lamp-shells or _Brachiopods_ are so numerous, and present\r\nsuch varied types, both in this and the succeeding period of\r\nthe Upper Silurian, that the name of \"Age of Brachiopods\" has\r\nwith justice been applied to the Silurian period as a whole. It\r\nwould be impossible here to enter into details as to the many\r\ndifferent forms of Brachiopods which present themselves in the\r\nLower Silurian deposits; but we may select the three genera _Orthis,\r\nStrophomena_, and _Leptoena_ for illustration, as being specially\r\ncharacteristic of this period, though not exclusively confined to it.\r\nThe numerous shells which belong to the extensive and cosmopolitan\r\ngenus _Orthis_ (fig. 50, a, b, c, and fig. 51, c and d),\r\nare usually more or less transversely-oblong or subquadrate, the\r\ntwo valves (as more or less in all the Brachiopods) of unequal\r\nsizes, generally more or less convex, and marked with radiating\r\nribs or lines. The valves of the shell are united to one another\r\nby teeth and sockets, and there is a straight hinge-line. The beaks\r\nare also separated by a distinct space (\"hinge-area\"), formed in\r\npart by each valve, which is perforated by a triangular opening,\r\nthrough which, in the living condition, passed a muscular cord\r\nattaching the shell to some foreign object. The genus _Strophomena_\r\n(fig. 50, d, and 51, a and b) is very like _Orthis_ in\r\ngeneral character; but the shell is usually much flatter, one\r\nor other valve often being concave, the hinge-line is longer,\r\nand the aperture for the emission of the stalk of attachment is\r\npartially closed by a calcareous plate. In _Leptoena_, again\r\n(fig. 51, e), the shell is like _Strophomena_ in many respects,\r\nbut generally comparatively longer, often completely semicircular,\r\nand having one valve convex and the other valve concave. Amongst\r\nother genera of Brachiopods which are largely represented in the\r\nLower Silurian rocks may be mentioned _Lingula, Crania, Discina,\r\nTrematis, Siphonotreta, Acrotreta, Rhynchonella_, and _Athyris_;\r\nbut none of these can claim the importance to which the three\r\npreviously-mentioned groups are entitled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Lower Silurian Brachiopods, a, _Strophomena\r\nalternata_, Cincinnati Group, America; b, _Strophomena filitexta,\r\nTrenton and Cincinnati Groups, America; c, _Orthis testudinaria_,\r\nCaradoc, Europe, and America; d, d', _Orthis plicateila_, Cincinnati\r\nGroup, America; e, e', e'', _Leptoena sericea_, Llandeilo and\r\nCaradoc, Europe and America. (After Meek, Hall, and the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe remaining Lower Silurian groups of _Mollusca_ can be but\r\nbriefly glanced at here. The Bivalves (_Lamellibranchiata_) find\r\nnumerous representatives, belonging to such genera as _Modiolopsis,\r\nCtenodonta, Orthonota, Paloearca, Lyrodesma, Ambonychia_, and\r\n_Cleidophorus_. The Univalves (_Gasteropoda_) are also very numerous,\r\nthe two most important genera being _Murchisonia_ (fig. 52) and\r\n_Pleurotomaria_. In both these groups the outer lip of the shell\r\nis notched; but the shell in the former is elongated and turreted,\r\nwhilst in the latter it is depressed. The curious oceanic Univalves\r\nknown as the _Heteropods_ are also very abundant, the principal\r\nforms belonging to _Bellerophon_ and _Maclurea_. In the former\r\n(fig. 53) there is a symmetrical convoluted shell, like that of\r\nthe Pearly Nautilus in shape, but without any internal partitions,\r\nand having the aperture often expanded and notched behind. The\r\nspecies of _Maclurea_ (fig. 54) are found both in North America\r\nand in Scotland, and are exclusively confined to the Lower Silurian\r\nperiod, so far as known. They have the shell coiled into a flat\r\nspiral, the mouth being furnished with a very curious, thick,\r\nand solid lid or \"operculum.\" The Lower Silurian _Pteropods_,\r\nor \"Winged snails,\" are numerous, and belong principally to the\r\ngenera _Theca, Conularia_, and _Tentaculites_, the last-mentioned\r\nof these often being extremely abundant in certain strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--_Murchisonia gracilis_, Trenton Limestone,\r\nAmerica.

(After Billings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--[14] Restoration of Orthoceras, the shell\r\nbeing supposed to be divided vertically, and only its upper part\r\nbeing shown. a, Arms; f, Muscular tube (\"funnel\") by which\r\nwater is expelled from the mantle-chamber; c, Air-chambers;\r\ns, Siphuncle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This illustration is taken from a rough sketch\r\nmade by the author many years ago, but he is unable to say from\r\nwhat original source it was copied.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the Lower Silurian Rocks have yielded a vast number of\r\nchambered shells, referable to animals which belong to the same\r\ngreat division as the Cuttle-fishes (the _Cephalopoda_), and\r\nof which the Pearly Nautilus is the only living representative\r\nat the present day. In this group of _Cephalopods_ the animal\r\npossesses a well-developed external shell, which is divided into\r\nchambers by shelly partitions (\"septa\"). The animal lives in\r\nthe last-formed and largest chamber of the shell, to which it\r\nis organically connected by muscular attachments. The head is\r\nfurnished with long muscular processes or \"arms,\" and can be\r\nprotruded from the mouth of the shell at will, or again withdrawn\r\nwithin it. We learn, also, from the Pearly Nautilus, that these\r\nanimals must have possessed two pairs of breathing organs or\r\n\"gills;\" hence all these forms are grouped together under the\r\nname of the \"Tetrabranchiate\" Cephalopods (Gr. _tetra_, four;\r\n_bragchia_, gill). On the other hand, the ordinary Cuttle-fishes\r\nand Calamaries either possess an internal skeleton, or if they\r\nhave an external shell, it is not chambered; their \"arms\" are\r\nfurnished with powerful organs of adhesion in the form of suckers;\r\nand they possess only a single pair of gills. For this last reason\r\nthey are termed the \"Dibranchiate\" Cephalopods (Gr. _dis_, twice;\r\n_bragchia_, gill). No trace of the true Cuttle-fishes has yet\r\nbeen found in Lower Silurian deposits; but the Tetrabranchiate\r\ngroup is represented by a great number of forms, sometimes of\r\ngreat size. The principal Lower Silurian genus is the well-known\r\nand widely-distributed _Orthoceras_ (fig. 55). The shell in this\r\ngenus agrees with that of the existing _Pearly Nautilus_, in\r\nconsisting of numerous chambers separated by shelly partitions\r\n(or septa), the latter being perforated by a tube which runs the\r\nwhole length of the shell after the last chamber, and is known\r\nas the \"siphuncle\" (fig. 56, s). The last chamber formed is the\r\nlargest, and in it the animal lives. The chambers behind this\r\nare apparently filled with some gas secreted by the animal itself;\r\nand these are supposed to act as a kind of float, enabling the\r\ncreature to move with ease under the weight of its shell. The\r\nvarious air-chambers, though the siphuncle passes through them,\r\nhave no direct connection with one another; and it is believed\r\nthat the animal has the power of slightly altering its specific\r\ngravity, and thus of rising or sinking in the water by driving\r\nadditional fluid into the siphuncle or partially emptying it.\r\nThe _Orthoceras_ further agrees with the Pearly Nautilus in the\r\nfact that the partitions or septa separating the different\r\nair-chambers are simple and smooth, concave in front and convex\r\nbehind, and devoid of the elaborate lobation which they exhibit\r\nin the Ammonites; whilst the siphuncle pierces the septa either\r\nin the centre or near it. In the Nautilus, however, the shell is\r\ncoiled into a flat spiral; whereas in _Orthoceras_ the shell is\r\na straight, longer or shorter cone, tapering behind, and gradually\r\nexpanding towards its mouth in front. The chief objections to\r\nthe belief that the animal of the _Orthoceras_ was essentially\r\nlike that of the Pearly Nautilus are--the comparatively small\r\nsize of the body-chamber, the often contracted aperture of the\r\nmouth, and the enormous size of some specimens of the shell.\r\nThus, some _Orthocerata_ have been discovered measuring ten or\r\ntwelve feet in length, with a diameter of a foot at the larger\r\nextremity. These colossal dimensions certainly make it difficult\r\nto imagine that the comparatively small body-chamber could have\r\nheld an animal large enough to move a load so ponderous as its\r\nown shell. To some, this difficulty has appeared so great that\r\nthey prefer to believe that the _Orthoceras_ did not live in\r\nits shell at all, but that its shell was an internal skeleton\r\nsimilar to what we shall find to exist in many of the true\r\nCuttle-fishes. There is something to be said in favour of this\r\nview, but it would compel us to believe in the existence in Lower\r\nSilurian times of Cuttle-fishes fully equal in size to the giant\r\n\"Kraken\" of fable. It need only be added in this connection that\r\nthe Lower Silurian rocks have yielded the remains of many other\r\nTetrabranchiate Cephalopods besides _Orthoceras_. Some of these\r\nbelong to _Cyrtoceras_, which only differs from _Orthoceras_ in\r\nthe bow-shaped form of the shell; others belong to _Phragmoceras_,\r\n_Lituites_, &c.; and, lastly; we have true _Nautili_, with their\r\nspiral shells, closely resembling the existing Pearly Nautilus.\r\n\r\nWhilst all the sub-kingdoms of the Invertebrate animals are\r\nrepresented in the Lower Silurian rocks, no traces of Vertebrate\r\nanimals have ever been discovered in these ancient deposits,\r\nunless the so-called \"Conodonts\" found by Pander in vast numbers\r\nin strata of this age [15] in Russia should prove to be really\r\nof this nature. These problematical bodies are of microscopic\r\nsize, and have the form of minute, conical, tooth-shaped spines,\r\nwith sharp edges, and hollow at the base. Their original discoverer\r\nregarded them as the horny teeth of fishes allied to the Lampreys;\r\nbut Owen came to the conclusion that they probably belonged to\r\nInvertebrates. The recent investigation of a vast number of similar\r\nbut slightly larger bodies, of very various forms, in the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of Ohio, has led Professor Newberry to the\r\nconclusion that these singular fossils really are, as Pander\r\nthought, the teeth of Cyclostomatous fishes. The whole of this\r\ndifficult question has thus been reopened, and we may yet have\r\nto record the first advent of Vertebrate animals in the Lower\r\nSilurian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: According to Pander, the \"Conodonts\" are found not\r\nonly in the Lower Silurian beds, but also in the \"Ungulite Grit\"\r\n(Upper Cambrian), as well as in the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\ndeposits of Russia. Should the Conodonts prove to be truly the\r\nremains of fishes, we should thus have to transfer the first\r\nappearance of vertebrates to, at any rate, as early a period as\r\nthe Upper Cambrian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER SILURIAN PERIOD.\r\n\r\nHaving now treated of the Lower Silurian period at considerable\r\nlength, it will not be necessary to discuss the succeeding group\r\nof the _Upper Silurian_ in the same detail--the more so, as with a\r\ngeneral change of _species_ the Upper Silurian animals belong for\r\nthe most part to the same great types as those which distinguish\r\nthe Lower Silurian. As compared, also, as regards the total bulk of\r\nstrata concerned, the thickness of the Upper Silurian is generally\r\nvery much below that of the Lower Silurian, indicating that they\r\nrepresent a proportionately shorter period of time. In considering\r\nthe general succession of the Upper Silurian beds, we shall,\r\nas before, select Wales and America as being two regions where\r\nthese deposits are typically developed.\r\n\r\nIn Wales and its borders the general succession of the Upper\r\nSilurian rocks may be taken to be as follows, in ascending order\r\n(fig. 57):--\r\n\r\n(1) The base of the Upper Silurian series is constituted by a\r\nseries of arenaceous beds, to which the name of \"May Hill Sandstone\"\r\nwas applied by Sedgwick. These are succeeded by a series of\r\ngreenish-grey or pale-grey slates (\"Tarannon Shales\"), sometimes\r\nof great thickness; and these two groups of beds together form\r\nwhat may be termed the \"_May Hill Group_\" (Upper Llandovery of\r\nMurchison). Though not very extensively developed in Britain, this\r\nzone is one very well marked by its fossils; and it corresponds\r\nwith the \"Clinton Group\" of North America, in which similar fossils\r\noccur. In South Wales this group is clearly unconformable to the\r\nhighest member of the subjacent Lower Silurian (the Llandovery\r\ngroup); and there is reason to believe that a similar, though\r\nless conspicuous, physical break occurs very generally between\r\nthe base of the Upper and the summit of the Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Wenlock Group_ succeeds the May Hill group, and constitutes\r\nthe middle member of the Upper Silurian. At its base it may have\r\nan irregular limestone (\"Woolhope Limestone\"), and its summit may\r\nbe formed by a similar but thicker calcareous deposit (\"Wenlock\r\nLimestone\"); but the bulk of the group is made up of the argillaceous\r\nand shaly strata known as the \"Wenlock Shale.\" In North Wales\r\nthe Wenlock group is, represented by a great accumulation of\r\nflaggy and gritty strata (the \"Denbighshire Flags and Grits\"),\r\nand similar beds (the \"Coniston Flags\" and \"Coniston Grits\")\r\ntake the same place in the north of England.\r\n\r\n(3) The _Ludlow Group_ is the highest member of the Upper Silurian,\r\nand consists typically of a lower arenaceous and shaly series (the\r\n\"Lower Ludlow Rock\") a middle calcareous member (the \"Aymestry\r\nLimestone\"), and an upper shaly and sandy series (the \"Upper\r\nLudlow Rock\" and \"Downton Sandstone\"). At the summit, or close\r\nto the summit, of the Upper Ludlow, is a singular stratum only a\r\nfew inches thick (varying from an inch to a foot), which contains\r\nnumerous remains of crustaceans and fishes, and is well known\r\nunder the name of the \"bone-bed.\" Finally, the Upper Ludlow rock\r\ngraduates invariably into a series of red sandy deposits, which,\r\nwhen of a flaggy character, are known locally as the \"Tile-stones.\"\r\nThese beds are probably to be regarded as the highest member\r\nof the Upper Silurian; but they are sometimes looked upon as\r\npassage-beds into the Old Red Sandstone, or as the base of this\r\nformation. It is, in fact, apparently impossible to draw any\r\nactual line of demarcation between the Upper Silurian and the\r\noverlying deposits of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone series.\r\nBoth in Britain and in America the Lower Devonian beds repose\r\nwith perfect conformity upon the highest Silurian beds, and the\r\ntwo formations appear to pass into one another by a gradual and\r\nimperceptible transition.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Silurian strata of Britain vary from perhaps 3000 or\r\n4000 feet in thickness up to 8000 or 10,000 feet. In North America\r\nthe corresponding series, though also variable, is generally of\r\nmuch smaller thickness, and may be under 1000 feet. The general\r\nsuccession of the Upper Silurian deposits of North America is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) _Medina Sandstone_.--This constitutes the base of the Upper\r\nSilurian, and consists of sandy strata, singularly devoid of life,\r\nand passing below in some localities into a conglomerate (\"Oneida\r\nConglomerate\"), which is stated to contain pebbles derived from\r\nthe older beds, and which would thus indicate an unconformity\r\nbetween the Upper and Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n(2) _Clinton Group_.--Above the Medina sandstone are beds of\r\nsandstone and shale, sometimes with calcareous bands, which\r\nconstitute what is known as the \"Clinton Group.\" The Medina and\r\nClinton groups are undoubtedly the equivalent of the \"May Hill\r\nGroup\" of Britain, as shown by the identity of their fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE UPPER SILURIAN\r\nSTRATA OF WALES AND SHROPSHIRE.]\r\n\r\n(3) _Niagara Group_.--This group consists typically of a series of\r\nargillaceous beds (\"Niagara Shale\") capped by limestones (\"Niagara\r\nLimestone\"); and the name of the group is derived from the fact\r\nthat it is over limestones of this age that the Niagara river\r\nis precipitated to form the great Falls. In places the Niagara\r\ngroup is wholly calcareous, and it is continued upwards into a\r\nseries of marls and sandstones, with beds of salt and masses\r\nof gypsum (the \"Salina Group\"), or into a series of magnesian\r\nlimestones (\"Guelph Limestones\"). The Niagara group, as a whole,\r\ncorresponds unequivocally with the Wenlock group of Britain.\r\n\r\n(4) _Lower Helderberg Group_.--The Upper Silurian period in North\r\nAmerica was terminated by the deposition of a series of calcareous\r\nbeds, which derive the name of \"Lower Helderberg\" from the Helderberg\r\nmountains, south of Albany, and which are divided into several zones,\r\ncapable of recognition by their fossils, and known by local names\r\n(Tentaculite Limestone, Water-lime, Lower Pentamerus Limestone,\r\nDelthyris Shaly Limestone, and Upper Pentamerus Limestone). As\r\na whole, this series may be regarded as the equivalent of the\r\nLudlow group of Britain, though it is difficult to establish any\r\nprecise parallelism. The summit of the Lower Heiderberg group\r\nis constituted by a coarse-grained sandstone (the \"Oriskany\r\nSandstone\"), replete with organic remains, which have to a large\r\nextent a Silurian _facies_. Opinions differ as to whether this\r\nsandstone is to be regarded as the highest bed of the Upper Silurian\r\nor the base of the Devonian. We thus see that in America, as\r\nin Britain, no other line than an artificial one can be drawn\r\nbetween the Upper Silurian and the overlying Devonian.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _life_ of the Upper Silurian period, we have,\r\nas before, a number of so-called \"Fucoids,\" the true vegetable\r\nnature of which is in many instances beyond doubt. In addition\r\nto these, however, we meet for the first time, in deposits of\r\nthis age, with the remains of genuine land-plants, though our\r\nknowledge of these is still too scanty to enable us to construct\r\nany detailed picture of the terrestrial vegetation of the period.\r\nSome of these remains indicate the existence of the remarkable genus\r\n_Lepidodendron_--a genus which played a part of great importance\r\nin the forests of the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and\r\nwhich may be regarded as a gigantic and extinct type of the\r\nClub-mosses (_Lycopodiaceoe_). Near the summit of the Ludlow\r\nformation in Britain there have also been found beds charged\r\nwith numerous small globular bodies, which Dr Hooker has shown\r\nto be the seed-vessels or \"sporangia\" of Club-mosses. Principal\r\nDawson further states that he has seen in the same formation\r\nfragments of wood with the structure of the singular Devonian\r\nConifer known as _Prototaxites_. Lastly, the same distinguished\r\nobserver has described from the Upper Silurian of North America\r\nthe remains of the singular land-plants belonging to the genus\r\n_Psilophyton_, which will be referred to at greater length hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe marine life of the Upper Silurian is in the main constituted\r\nby types of animals similar to those characterising the Lower\r\nSilurian, though for the most part belonging to different species.\r\nThe _Protozoans_ are represented principally by _Stromatopora_ and\r\n_Ischadites_, along with a number of undoubted sponges (such as\r\n_Amphispongia, Astroeospongia, Astylospongia_, and _Paloeomanon_).\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Coelenterates_, we find the old group of _Graptolites_\r\nnow verging on extinction. Individuals still remain numerous,\r\nbut the variety of generic and specific types has now become\r\ngreatly reduced. All the branching and complex forms of the Arenig,\r\nthe twin-Graptolites and _Dicranograpti_ of the Llandeilo, and\r\nthe double-celled _Diplograpti_ and _Climacograpti_ of the Bala\r\ngroup, have now disappeared. In their place we have the singular\r\n_Retiolites_, with its curiously-reticulated skeleton; and several\r\nspecies of the single-celled genus _Monograptus_, of which a\r\ncharacteristic species (_M. Priodon_) is here figured. If we\r\nremove from this group the plant-like _Dictyonemoe_, which are\r\nstill present, and which survive into the Devonian, no known\r\nspecies of _Graptolite_ has hitherto been detected in strata\r\nhigher in geological position than the Ludlow. This, therefore,\r\npresents us with the first instance we have as yet met with of\r\nthe total disappearance and extinction of a great and important\r\nseries of organic forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--A, _Monograptus priodon_, slightly enlarged.\r\nB, Fragment of the same viewed from behind. C, Fragment of the\r\nsame viewed in front, showing the mouths of the cellules. D,\r\nCross-section of the same. From the Wenlock Group (Coniston Flags\r\nof the North of England). (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Corals_ are very numerously represented in the Upper Silurian\r\nrocks some of the limestones (such as the Wenlock Limestone)\r\nbeing often largely composed of the skeletons of these animals.\r\nAlmost all the known forms of this period belong to the two great\r\ndivisions of the Rugose and Tabulate corals, the former being\r\nrepresented by species of _Zaphrentis, Omphyma, Cystiphyllum,\r\nStrombodes, Acervularia, Cyathophyllum_, &c.; whilst the latter\r\nbelong principally to the genera _Favosites, Choetetes, Halysites,\r\nSyringopora, Heliolites_, and _Plasmopora_. Amongst the _Rugosa_, the\r\nfirst appearance of the great and important genus _Cyathophyllum_,\r\nso characteristic of the Palæozoic period, is to be noted; and\r\namongst the _Tabulata_ we have similarly the first appearance,\r\nin force at any rate, of the widely-spread genus _Favosites_--the\r\n\"Honeycomb-corals.\" The \"Chain-corals\" (_Halysites_), figured\r\nbelow (fig. 59), are also very common examples of the Tabulate\r\ncorals during this period, though they occur likewise in the\r\nLower Silurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--a, _Halysites catenularia_, small variety,\r\nof the natural size; b, Fragment of a large variety of the same,\r\nof the natural size; c, Fragment of limestone with the tubes\r\nof _Halysites agglomerata_, of the natural size; d, Vertical\r\nsection of two tubes of the same, showing the tabulæ, enlarged.\r\nNiagara Limestone (Wenlock), Canada.

(After Salter.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Echinodermata_, all those orders which have hard parts\r\ncapable of ready preservation are more or less largely represented.\r\nWe have no trace of the Holothurians or Sea-cucumbers; but this\r\nis not surprising, as the record of the past is throughout almost\r\nsilent as to the former existence of these soft-bodied creatures,\r\nthe scattered plates and spicules in their skin offering a very\r\nuncertain chance of preservation in the fossil condition. The\r\nSea-urchins (_Echinoids_) are said to be represented by examples\r\nof the old genus _Paloechinus_. The Star-fishes (_Asteroids_) and\r\nthe Brittle-stars (_Ophiuroids_) are, comparatively speaking,\r\nlargely represented; the former by species of _Palasterina_ (fig.\r\n60), _Paloeaster_ (fig. 60), _Paloeocoma_ (fig. 60), _Petraster,\r\nGlyptaster_, and _Lepidaster_--and the latter by species of\r\n_Protaster_ (fig. 61), _Paloeodiscus, Acroura_, and _Eucladia_.\r\nThe singular _Cystideans_, or \"Globe Crinoids,\" with their globular\r\nor ovate, tesselated bodies (fig. 46, A, C, D,), are also not\r\nuncommon in the Upper Silurian; and if they do not become finally\r\nextinct here, they certainly survive the close of this period by\r\nbut a very brief time. By far the most important, however, of\r\nthe Upper Silurian Echinodenns, are the Sea-lilies or _Crinoids_.\r\nThe limestones of this period are often largely composed of the\r\nfragmentary columns and detached plates of these creatures, and\r\nsome of them (such as the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley) have yielded\r\nperhaps the most exquisitely-preserved examples of this group\r\nwith which we are as yet acquainted. However varied in their\r\nforms, these beautiful organisms consist of a globular, ovate,\r\nor pear-shaped body (the \"calyx\"), supported upon a longer or\r\nshorter jointed stem (or \"column\"). The body is covered externally\r\nwith an armour of closely-fitting calcareous plates (fig. 62),\r\nand its upper surface is protected by similar but smaller plates\r\nmore loosely connected by a leathery integument. From the upper\r\nsurface of the body, round its margin, springs a series of longer\r\nor shorter flexible processes, composed of innumerable calcareous\r\njoints or pieces, movably united with one another. The arms are\r\ntypically five in number; but they generally subdivide at least\r\nonce, sometimes twice, and they are furnished with similar but\r\nmore slender lateral branches or \"pinnules,\" thus giving rise\r\nto a crown of delicate feathery plumes. The \"column\" is the stem\r\nby which the animal is attached permanently to the bottom of the\r\nsea; and it is composed of numerous separate plates, so jointed\r\ntogether that whilst the amount of movement between any two pieces\r\nmust be very limited, the entire column acquires more or less\r\nflexibility, allowing the organism as a whole to wave backwards and\r\nforwards on its stalk. Into the exquisite _minutioe_ of structure\r\nby which the innumerable parts entering into the composition\r\nof a single Crinoid are adapted for their proper purposes in\r\nthe economy of the animal, it is impossible to enter here. No\r\nperiod, as before said, has yielded examples of greater beauty\r\nthan the Upper Silurian, the principal genera represented being\r\n_Cyathocrinus, Platycrinus, Marsupiocrinus, Taxocrinus,\r\nEucalyptocrinus, Ichthyocrinus, Mariacrinus, Periechocrinus,\r\nGlyptocrinus, Crotalocrinus_, and _Edriocrinus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 62.--Upper Silurian Crinoids. a, Calyx and\r\narms of _Eucalyptocrinus polydactylus_, Wenlock Limestone; b,\r\n_Ichthyocrinus loevis_, Niagara Limestone, America; c, _Taxocrinus\r\ntuberculatus_, Wenlock Limestone. (After M'Coy and Hall.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--_Planolites vulgaris_, the filled-up\r\nburrows of a marine worm. Upper Silurian (Clinton Group), Canada.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe tracks and burrows of _Annelides_ are as abundant in the\r\nUpper Silurian strata as in older deposits, and have just as\r\ncommonly been regarded as plants. The most abundant forms are the\r\ncylindrical, twisted bodies (Planolites), which are so frequently\r\nfound on the surfaces of sandy beds, and which have been described\r\nas the stems of sea-weeds. These fossils (fig. 63), however,\r\ncan be nothing more, in most cases, than the filled-up burrows\r\nof marine worms resembling the living Lob-worms. There are also\r\nvarious remains which belong to the group of the tube-inhabiting\r\nAnnelides (_Tubicola_). Of this nature are the tubes of _Serpulites_\r\nand _Cornultites_, and the little spiral discs of _Spirorbis\r\nLewisii_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Upper Silurian Trilobites. a, _Cheirurus\r\nbimucronatus_, Wenlock and Caradoc; b, _Phacops longicaudatus_,\r\nWenlock, Britain, and America; c, _Phacops Downingioe_, Wenlock\r\nand Ludlow; d, _Harpes ungula_, Upper Silurian, Bohemia. (After\r\nSalter and Barrande.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Articulates_, we still meet only with the remains of\r\n_Crustaceans_. Besides the little bivalved _Ostracoda_--which here\r\nare occasionally found of the size of beans--and various _Phyllopods_\r\nof different kinds, we have an abundance of _Trilobites_. These\r\nlast-mentioned ancient types, however, are now beginning to show\r\nsigns of decadence; and though still individually numerous, there\r\nis a great diminution in the number of generic types. Many of\r\nthe old genera, which flourished so abundantly in Lower Silurian\r\nseas, have now died out; and the group is represented chiefly\r\nby species of _Cheirurus, Encrinurus, Harpes, Proetus, Lichas,\r\nAcidaspis, Illoenus, Calymene, Homalonotus_, and _Phacops_--the\r\nlast of these, one of the highest and most beautiful of the groups\r\nof Trilobites, attaining here its maximum of development. In the\r\nannexed illustration (fig. 64) some of the characteristic Upper\r\nSilurian Trilobites are represented--all, however, belonging\r\nto genera which have their commencement in the Lower Silurian\r\nperiod. In addition to the above, the Ludlow rocks of Britain\r\nand the Lower Helderberg beds of North America have yielded the\r\nremains of certain singular Crustaceans belonging to the extinct\r\norder of the _Eurypterida_. Some of these wonderful forms are\r\nnot remarkable for their size; but others, such as _Pterygotus\r\nAnglicus_ (fig. 65), attain a length of six feet or more, and\r\nmay fairly be considered as the giants of their class. The\r\nEurypterids are most nearly allied to the existing King-crabs\r\n(_Limuli_), and have the anterior end of the body covered with\r\na great head-shield, carrying two pairs of eyes, the one simple\r\nand the other compound. The feelers are converted into pincers,\r\nwhilst the last pair of limbs have their bases covered with spiny\r\nteeth so as to act as jaws, and are flattened and widened out\r\ntowards their extremities so as to officiate as swimming-paddles.\r\nThe hinder extremity of the body is composed of thirteen rings,\r\nwhich have no legs attached to them; and the last segment of\r\nthe tail is either a flattened plate or a narrow, sword-shaped\r\nspine. Fragments of the skeleton are easily recognised by the\r\npeculiar scale-like markings with which the surface is adorned,\r\nand which look not at all unlike the scales of a fish. The most\r\nfamous locality for these great Crustaceans is Lesmahagow, in\r\nLanarkshire, where many different species have been found. The\r\ntrue King-crabs (_Limuli_) of existing seas also appear to have\r\nbeen represented by at least one form (_Neolimulus_) in the Upper\r\nSilurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--_Pterygotus Anglicus_, viewed from the\r\nunder side, reduced in size, and restored. c c, The feelers\r\n(antennæ), terminating in nipping-claws; o o, Eyes; m m,\r\nThree pairs of jointed limbs, with pointed extremities; n n,\r\nSwimming-paddles, the bases of which are spiny and act as jaws.\r\nUpper Silurian, Lanarkshire. (After Henry Woodward.)]\r\n\r\nComing to the _Mollusca_, we note the occurrence of the same\r\ngreat groups as in the Lower Silurian. Amongst the Sea-mosses\r\n(_Polyzoa_), we have the ancient Lace-corals (_Fenestella_ and\r\n_Retepora_), with the nearly-allied _Glauconome_, and species\r\nof _Ptilodictya_ (fig. 66); whilst many forms often referred\r\nhere may probably have to be transferred to the Corals, just as\r\nsome so-called Corals will ultimately be removed to the present\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Upper Silurian Polyzoa. 1, Fan-shaped\r\nfrond of _Rhinopora verrucosa_; 1a, Portion of the surface of\r\nthe same, enlarged; 2 and 2a, _Phoenopora ensiformis_, of the\r\nnatural size and enlarged; 3 and 3a, _Helopora fragilis_, of\r\nthe natural size and enlarged; 4 and 4a, _Ptilodictya raripora_,\r\nof the natural size and enlarged.

(After Hall, Billings, and the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe Brachiopods continued to flourish during the Upper Silurian\r\nPeriod in immense numbers and under a greatly increased variety\r\nof forms. The three prominent Lower Silurian genera _Orthis,\r\nStrophomena_, and _Leptoena_ are still well represented, though\r\nthey have lost their former preeminence. Amongst the numerous\r\ntypes which have now come upon the scene for the first time,\r\nor which have now a special development, are _Spirifera_ and\r\n_Pentamerus_. In the first of these (fig. 69. b, c), one of\r\nthe valves of the shell (the dorsal) is furnished in its interior\r\nwith a pair of great calcareous spires, which served for the\r\nsupport of the long and fringed fleshy processes or \"arms\" which\r\nwere attached to the sides of the mouth.[16] In the genus\r\n_Pentamerus_ (fig. 70) the shell is curiously subdivided in its\r\ninterior by calcareous plates. The _Pentameri_ commenced their\r\nexistence at the very close of the Lower Silurian (Llandovery),\r\nand survived to the close of the Upper Silurian; but they are\r\nspecially characteristic of the May Hill and Wenlock groups,\r\nboth in Britain and in other regions. One species, _Pentamerus\r\ngaleatus_, is common to Sweden, Britain, and America. Amongst\r\nthe remaining Upper Silurian Brachiopods are the extraordinary\r\n_Trimerellids_; the old and at the same time modern _Linguloe,\r\nDiscinoe_, and _Cranioe_; together with many species of _Atrypa_\r\n(fig. 68, e), _Leptocoelia_ (fig. 68, a), _Rhynchonella_\r\n(fig. 68, b, c), _Meristella_ (fig. 69, a, e, f), _Athyris,\r\nRetzia, Chonetes_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: In all the Lamp-shells the mouth is provided with\r\ntwo long fleshy organs, which carry delicate filaments on their\r\nsides, and which are usually coiled into a spiral. These organs\r\nare known as the \"arms,\" and it is from their presence that the\r\nname of \"_Brachiopoda_\" is derived (Gr. _brachion_, arm; _podes_,\r\nfeet). In some cases the arms are merely coiled away within the\r\nshell, without any support; but in other cases they are carried\r\nupon a more or less elaborate shelly loop, often spoken of as the\r\n\"carriage-spring apparatus.\" In the _Spirifers_, and in other ancient\r\ngenera, this apparatus is coiled up into a complicated spiral (fig.\r\n67). It is these \"arms,\" with or without the supporting loops or\r\nspires, which serve as one of the special characters distinguishing\r\nthe _Brachiopods_ from the true Bivalves (_Lamellibranchiata_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.-a a', Meristella intermedia_, Niagara\r\nGroup, America; b, _Spirifera Niagarensis_, Niagara Group, America;\r\nc c', _Spirifera crispa_, May Hill to Ludlow, Britain, and Niagara\r\nGroup, America; d, _Strophomena (Streptorhynchus) subplana_,\r\nNiagara Group, America; e, _Meristella naviformis_, Niagara Group,\r\nAmerica; f, _Meristella cylindrica_, Niagara Group, America.\r\n(After Hall, Billings, and the Author.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--_Pentamerus Knightii_.

Upper Silurian\r\nof Europe and North America.]\r\n\r\nThe higher groups of the _Mollusca_ are also largely represented\r\nin the Upper Silurian. Apart from some singular types, such as\r\nthe huge and thick-shelled _Megalomi_ of the American Wenlock\r\nformation, the Bivalves (_Lamellibranchiata_) present little of\r\nspecial interest; for though sufficiently numerous, they are rarely\r\nwell preserved, and their true affinities are often uncertain.\r\nAmongst the most characteristic genera of this period may be\r\nmentioned _Cardiola_ (fig. 71, A and C) and _Pterinea_ (fig. 71,\r\nB), though the latter survives to a much later date. The Univalves\r\n(_Gasteropoda_) are very numerous, and a few characteristic forms\r\nare here figured (fig. 72). Of these, no genus is perhaps more\r\ncharacteristic than _Euomphalus_ (fig. 72, b), with its flat\r\ndiscoidal shell, coiled up into an oblique spiral, and deeply\r\nhollowed out on one side; but examples of this group are both\r\nof older and of more modern date. Another very extensive genus,\r\nespecially in America, is Platyceras (fig. 72, a and f),\r\nwith its thin fragile shell--often hardly coiled up at all--its\r\nminute spire, and its widely-expanded, often sinuated mouth. The\r\nBritish _Acroculioe_ should probably be placed here, and the\r\ngroup has with reason been regarded as allied to the Violet-snails\r\n(_Ianthina_) of the open Atlantic. The species of _Platyostoma_\r\n(fig. 72, h) also belong to the same family; and the entire\r\ngroup is continued throughout the Devonian into the Carboniferous.\r\nAmongst other well-known Upper Silurian Gasteropods are species\r\nof the genera _Holopea_ (fig. 72, g), _Holopella_ (fig. 72.\r\ne), _Platyschisma_ (fig. 72, d), _Cyclonema, Pleurotomaria,\r\nMurchisonia, Trochonema_, &c. The oceanic Univalves (_Heteropods_)\r\nare represented mainly by species of _Bellerophon_; and the Winged\r\nSnails, or _Pteropods_, can still boast of the gigantic _Thecoe_\r\nand _Conularioe_, which characterise yet older deposits. The\r\ncommonest genus of _Pteropoda_, however, is _Tentaculites_ (fig.\r\n73), which clearly belongs here, though it has commonly been\r\nregarded as the tube of an Annelide. The shell in this group\r\nis a conical tube, usually adorned with prominent transverse\r\nrings, and often with finer transverse or longitudinal striæ as\r\nwell; and many beds of the Upper Silurian exhibit myriads of\r\nsuch tubes scattered promiscuously over their surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe last and highest group of the _Mollusca_--that of the\r\n_Cephalopoda_--is still represented only by _Tetrabranchiate_\r\nforms; but the abundance and variety of these is almost beyond\r\nbelief. Many hundreds of different species are known, chiefly\r\nbelonging to the straight _Orthoceratites_, but the slightly-curved\r\n_Cyrtoceras_ is only little less common. There are also numerous\r\nforms of the genera _Phragmoceras, Ascoceras, Gyroteras, Lituites_,\r\nand _Nautilus_. Here, also, are the first-known species of the\r\ngenus _Goniatites_--a group which attains considerable importance\r\nin later deposits, and which is to be regarded as the precursor\r\nof the _Ammonites_ of the Secondary period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Head-shield of _Pteraspis Banksii_, Ludlow\r\nrocks. (After Murchison.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--A, Spine of _Onchus tenuistriatus_;\r\nB, Shagreen-scales of _Thelodus_. Both from the \"bone-bed\" of\r\nthe Upper Ludlow rocks. (After Murchison.)]\r\n\r\nFinally, we find ourselves for the first time called upon to\r\nconsider the remains of undoubted vertebrate animals, in the\r\nform of _Fishes_. The oldest of these remains, so far as yet\r\nknown, are found in the Lower Ludlow rocks, and they consist of\r\nthe bony head-shields or bucklers of certain singular armoured\r\nfishes belonging to the group of the _Ganoids_, represented at\r\nthe present day by the Sturgeons, the Gar-pikes of North America,\r\nand a few other less familiar forms. The principal Upper Silurian\r\ngenus of these is _Pteraspis_, and the annexed illustration (fig.\r\n74) will give some idea of the extraordinary form of the shield\r\ncovering the head in these ancient fishes. The remarkable stratum\r\nnear the top of the Ludlow formation known as the \"bone-bed\" has\r\nalso yielded the remains of shark-like fishes. Some of these,\r\nfor which the name of _Onchus_ has been proposed, are in the form\r\nof compressed, slightly-curved spines (fig. 75, A), which would\r\nappear to be of the nature of the strong defensive spines implanted\r\nin front of certain of the fins in many living fishes. Besides\r\nthese, have been found fragments of prickly skin or shagreen\r\n(_Sphagodus_), along with minute cushion-shaped bodies (_Thelodus_,\r\nfig. 75, B), which are doubtless the bony scales of some fish\r\nresembling the modern Dog-fishes. As the above mentioned remains\r\nbelong to two distinct, and at the same time highly-organised,\r\ngroups of the fishes, it is hardly likely that we are really\r\npresented here with the first examples of this great class. On\r\nthe contrary, whether the so-called \"Conodonts\" should prove\r\nto be the teeth of fishes or not, we are justified in expecting\r\nthat unequivocal remains of this group of animals will still be\r\nfound in the Lower Silurian. It is interesting, also, to note\r\nthat the first appearance of fishes--the lowest class of vertebrate\r\nanimals--so far as known to us at present, does not take place\r\nuntil after all the great sub-kingdoms of invertebrates have\r\nbeen long in existence; and there is no reason for thinking that\r\nfuture discoveries will materially affect the _relative_ order\r\nof succession thus indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nFrom the vast and daily-increasing mass of Silurian literature, it\r\nis impossible to do more than select a small number of works which\r\nhave a classical and historical interest to the English-speaking\r\ngeologist, or which embody researches on special groups of Silurian\r\nanimals--anything like an enumeration of all the works and papers\r\non this subject being wholly out of the question. Apart, therefore,\r\nfrom numerous and in many cases extremely important memoirs,\r\nby various well-known observers, both at home and abroad, the\r\nfollowing are some of the more weighty works to which the student\r\nmay refer in investigating the physical characters and succession\r\nof the Silurian strata and their fossil contents:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Siluria.'

The characteristic crustaceans and many of the\r\ncharacteristic fishes of the Old Red are wanting in the Devonian;\r\nwhilst the corals and marine shells of the latter do not occur in\r\nthe former. It is impossible here to enter into any discussion\r\nas to the merits of the controversy to which this difficulty\r\nhas given origin. No one, however, can doubt the importance and\r\nreality of the Devonian series as an independent system of rocks\r\nto be intercalated in point of time between the Silurian and\r\nthe Carboniferous. The want of agreement, both lithologically\r\nand palæontologically, between the Devonian and the Old Red,\r\ncan be explained by supposing that these two formations, though\r\nwholly or in great part _contemporaneous_, and therefore strict\r\nequivalents, represent deposits in two different geographical\r\nareas, laid down under different conditions. On this view, the\r\ntypical Devonian rocks of Europe, Britain, and North America are\r\nthe deep-sea deposits of the Devonian period, or, at any rate, are\r\ngenuine marine sediments formed far from land. On the other hand,\r\nthe \"Old Red Sandstone\" of Britain and the corresponding \"Gaspé\r\nGroup\" of Eastern Canada represent the shallow-water shore-deposits\r\nof the same period. In fact, the former of these last-mentioned\r\ndeposits contains no fossils which can be asserted positively\r\nto be _marine_ (unless the Eurypterids be considered so); and\r\nit is even conceivable that it represents the sediments of an\r\ninland sea. Accepting this explanation in the meanwhile, we may\r\nvery briefly consider the general succession of the deposits of\r\nthis period in Scotland, in Devonshire, and in North America.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the \"Old Red\" forms a great series of arenaceous and\r\nconglomeratic strata, attaining a thickness of many thousands of\r\nfeet, and divisible into three groups. Of these, the _Lower Old\r\nRed Sandstone_ reposes with perfect conformity upon the highest\r\nbeds of the Upper Silurian, the two formations being almost\r\ninseparably united by an intermediate series of \"passage-beds.\"\r\nIn mineral nature this group consists principally of massive\r\nconglomerates, sandstones, shales, and concretionary limestones;\r\nand its fossils consist chiefly of large crustaceans belonging to\r\nthe family of the _Eurypterids_, fishes, and plants. The _Middle\r\nOld Red Sandstone_ consists of flagstones, bituminous shales,\r\nand conglomerates, sometimes with irregular calcareous bands;\r\nand its fossils are principally fishes and plants. It may be\r\nwholly wanting, when the _Upper Old Red_ seems to repose\r\nunconformably upon the lower division of the series. The _Upper\r\nOld Red Sandstone_ consists of conglomerates and grits, along\r\nwith a great series of red and yellow sandstones--the fossils,\r\nas before, being fishes and remains of plants. The Upper Old\r\nRed graduates upwards conformably into the Carboniferous series.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian rocks of Devonshire are likewise divisible into a\r\nlower, middle, and upper division. The _Lower Devonian_ or _Lynton\r\nGroup_ consists of red and purple sandstones, with marine fossils,\r\ncorresponding to the \"Spirifer Sandstein\" of Germany, and to the\r\narenaceous deposits (Schoharie and Cauda-Galli Grits) at the base\r\nof the American Devonian. The _Middle Devonian_ or _Ilfracombe\r\nGroup_ consists of sandstones and flags, with calcareous slates\r\nand crystalline limestones, containing many corals. It corresponds\r\nwith the great \"Eifel Limestone\" of the Continent, and, in a\r\ngeneral way, with the Corniferous Limestone and Hamilton group\r\nof North America. The _Upper Devonian_ or _Pilton Group_, lastly,\r\nconsists of sandstones and calcareous shales which correspond with\r\nthe \"Clymenia Limestone\" and \"Cypridina Shales\" of the Continent,\r\nand with the Chemung and Portage groups of North America. It\r\nseems quite possible, also, that the so-called \"Carboniferous\r\nSlates\" of Ireland correspond with this group, and that the former\r\nwould be more properly regarded as forming the summit of the\r\nDevonian than the base of the Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nIn no country in the world, probably, is there a finer or more\r\ncomplete exposition of the strata intervening between the Silurian\r\nand Carboniferous deposits than in the United States. The following\r\nare the main subdivisions of the Devonian rocks in the State of\r\nNew York, where the series may be regarded as being typically\r\ndeveloped (fig. 67):--\r\n\r\n(1) _Cauda-Galli Grit_ and _Schoharie Grit_.--Considering the\r\n\"Oriskany Sandstone\" as the summit of the Upper Silurian, the\r\nbase of the Devonian is constituted by the arenaceous deposits\r\nknown by the above names, which rest quite conformably upon the\r\nSilurian, and which represent the Lower Devonian of Devonshire. The\r\n_Cauda-Galli Grit_ is so called from the abundance of a peculiar\r\nspiral fossil (_Spirophyton cauda-Galli_), which is of common\r\noccurrence in the Carboniferous rocks of Britain, and is supposed\r\nto be the remains of a sea-weed.\r\n\r\n(2) The _Corniferous_ or _Upper Helderberg Limestone_.--A series\r\nof limestones usually charged with considerable quantities of\r\nsiliceous matter in the shape of hornstone or chert (Lat. _cornu_,\r\nhorn). The thickness of this group rarely exceeds 300 feet; but\r\nit is replete with fossils, more especially with the remains\r\nof corals. The Corniferous Limestone is the equivalent of the\r\ncoral-bearing limestones of the Middle Devonian of Devonshire\r\nand the great \"Eifel Limestone\" of Germany.\r\n\r\n(3) The _Hamilton Group_--consisting of shales at the base\r\n(\"Marcellus shales\"); flags, shales, and impure limestones (\"Hamilton\r\nbeds\") in the middle; and again a series of shales (\"Genesee\r\nSlates\") at the top. The thickness of this group varies from\r\n200 to 1200 feet, and it is richly charged with marine fossils.\r\n\r\n(4) The _Portage Group_.--A great series of shales, flags, and\r\nshaly sandstones, with few fossils.\r\n\r\n(5) The _Chemung Group_.--Another great series of sandstones and\r\nshales, but with many fossils. The Portage and Chemung groups\r\nmay be regarded as corresponding with the Upper Devonian of\r\nDevonshire. The Chemung beds are succeeded by a great series\r\nof red sandstones and shales--the \"Catskill Group\"--which pass\r\nconformably upwards into the Carboniferous, and which may perhaps\r\nbe regarded as the equivalent of the great sandstones of the\r\nUpper Old Red in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire series of Devonian deposits in North America\r\nno unconformability or physical break of any kind has hitherto been\r\ndetected; nor is there any marked interruption to the current of\r\nlife, though each subdivision of the series has its own fossils.\r\nNo completely natural line can thus be indicated, dividing the\r\nDevonian in this region from the Silurian on the one hand, and\r\nthe Carboniferous on the other hand. At the same time, there is\r\nthe most ample evidence, both stratigraphical and palæontological,\r\nas to the complete independence of the American Devonian series\r\nas a distinct life-system between the older Silurian and the\r\nlater Carboniferous. The subjoined section (fig. 76) shows\r\ndiagrammatically the general succession of the Devonian rocks\r\nof North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE DEVONIAN ROCKS\r\nOF NORTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Restoration of _Psilophyton princeps_.\r\nDevonian, Canada. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\nAs regards the _life_ of the Devonian period, we are now acquainted\r\nwith a large and abundant terrestrial _flora_--this being the\r\nfirst time that we have met with a land vegetation capable of\r\nreconstruction in any fulness. By the researches of Goeppert,\r\nUnger, Dawson, Carruthers, and other botanists, a knowledge has\r\nbeen acquired of a large number of Devonian plants, only a few\r\nof which can be noticed here. As might have been anticipated,\r\nthe greater number of the vegetable remains of this period have\r\nbeen obtained from such shallow-water deposits as the Old Red\r\nSandstone proper and the Gaspè series of North America, and few\r\ntraces of plant-life occur in the strictly marine sediments.\r\nApart from numerous remains, mostly of a problematical nature,\r\nreferred to the comprehensive group of the Sea-weeds, a large\r\nnumber of Ferns have now been recognised, some being, of the\r\nordinary plant-like type (_Pecopteris, Neuropteris, Alethopteris,\r\nSphenopteris_, &c.), whilst others belong to the gigantic group\r\nof the \"Tree-ferns\" (_Psaronius, Caulopteris_, &c.) Besides these\r\nthere is an abundant development of the singular extinct types of\r\nthe _Lepidodendroids_, the _Sigillarioids_, and the _Calamites_,\r\nall of which attained their maximum in the Carboniferous. Of\r\nthese, the _Lepidodendra_ may be regarded as gigantic, tree-like\r\nClub-mosses (_Lycopodiaceoe_); the _Calamites_ are equally gigantic\r\nHorse-tails (_Equisetaceoe_); and the _Sigillarioids_, equally huge\r\nin size, in some respects hold a position intermediate between\r\nthe Club-mosses and the Pines (Conifers). The Devonian rocks have\r\nalso yielded traces of many other plants (such as _Annularia,\r\nAsterophyllites, Cardiocarpon_, &c.), which acquire a greater\r\npre-dominance in the Carboniferous period, and which will be\r\nspoken of in discussing the structure of the plants of the\r\nCoal-measures. Upon the whole, the one plant which may be considered\r\nas specially characteristic of the Devonian (though not confined\r\nto this series) is the _Psilophyton_ (fig. 77) of Dr Dawson.\r\nThese singular plants have slender branching stems, with sparse\r\nneedle-shaped leaves, the young stems being at first coiled up,\r\ncrosier-fashion, like the young fronds of ferns, whilst the old\r\nbranches carry numerous spore-cases. The stems and branches seem\r\nto have attained a height of two or three feet; and they sprang\r\nfrom prostrate \"root-stocks\" or creeping stems. Upon the whole,\r\nPrincipal Dawson is disposed to regard _Psilophyton_ as a\r\n\"generalised type\" of plants intermediate between the Ferns and\r\nthe Club-mosses. Lastly, the Devonian deposits have yielded the\r\nremains of the first actual _trees_ with which we are as yet\r\nacquainted. About the nature of some of these (_Ormoxylon_ and\r\n_Dadoxylon_) no doubt can be entertained, since their trunks\r\nnot only show the concentric rings of growth characteristic of\r\nexogenous trees in general, but their woody tissue exhibits under\r\nthe microscope the \"discs\" which are characteristic of the wood of\r\nthe Pines and Firs (see fig. 2). The singular genus _Prototaxites_,\r\nhowever, which occurs in an older portion of the Devonian series\r\nthan the above, is not in an absolutely unchallenged position.\r\nBy Principal Dawson it is regarded as the trunk of an ancient\r\n_Conifer_--the most ancient known; but Mr Carruthers regards it\r\nas more probably the stem of a gigantic sea-weed. The trunks\r\nof _Prototaxites_ (fig. 78, A) vary from one to three feet in\r\ndiameter, and exhibit concentric rings of growth; but its woody\r\nfibres have not hitherto been clearly demonstrated to possess discs.\r\nBefore leaving the Devonian vegetation, it may be mentioned that\r\nthe hornstone or chert so abundant in the Corniferous limestone\r\nof North America has been shown to contain the remains of various\r\nmicroscopic plants (_Diatoms_ and _Desmids_). We find also in\r\nthe same siliceous material the singular spherical bodies, with\r\nradiating spines, which occur so abundantly in the chalk flints,\r\nand which are termed _Xanthidia_. These may be regarded as probably\r\nthe spore-cases of the minute plants known as _Desmidioe_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--A, Trunk of _Prototaxites Logani_, eighteen\r\ninches in diameter, as seen in the cliff near L'Anse Brehaut,\r\nGaspé; B, Two wood-cells showing spiral fibres and obscure pores,\r\nhighly magnified. Lower Devonian, Canada. (After Dawson)]\r\n\r\nThe Devonian _Protozoans_ have still to be fully investigated.\r\nTrue Sponges (such as _Astrtoeospongia, Sphoerospongia_, &c.)\r\nare not unknown; but by far the commonest representatives of\r\nthis sub-kingdom in the Devonian strata are _Stromatopora_ and\r\nits allies. These singular organisms (fig. 79) are not only very\r\nabundant in some of the Devonian limestones--both in the Old World\r\nand the New--but they often attain very large dimensions. However\r\nmuch they may differ in minor details, the general structure of\r\nthese bodies is that of numerous, concentrically-arranged, thin,\r\ncalcareous laminæ, separated by narrow interspaces, which in turn\r\nare crossed by numerous delicate vertical pillars, giving the whole\r\nmass a cellular structure, and dividing it into innumerable minute\r\nquadrangular compartments. Many of the Devonian _Stromatoporoe_\r\nalso exhibit on their surface the rounded openings of canals,\r\nwhich can hardly have served any other purpose than that of\r\npermitting the sea-water to gain ready access to every part of\r\nthe organism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--a, Part of the under surface of\r\n_Stromatopora tuberculata_, showing the wrinkled basement membrane\r\nand the openings of water-canals, of the natural size; b, Portion\r\nof the upper surface of the same, enlarged; c, Vertical section of\r\na fragment, magnified to show the internal structure.

(Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Portion of a mass of _Crepidophyllum\r\nArchiaci_, of the natural size. Hamilton Formation, Canada. (After\r\nBillings.)]\r\n\r\nNo true _Graptolites_ have ever been detected in strata of Devonian\r\nage; and the whole of this group has become extinguished--unless we\r\nrefer here the still surviving _Dictyonemoe_. The _Coelenterates_,\r\nhowever, are represented by a vast number of _Corals_, of beautiful\r\nforms and very varied types. The marbles of Devonshire, the Devonian\r\nlimestones of the Eifel and of France, and the calcareous strata\r\nof the Corniferous and Hamilton groups of America, are often\r\nreplete with the skeletons of these organisms--so much so as to\r\nsometimes entitle the rock to be considered as representing an\r\nancient coral-reef. In some instances the Corals have preserved\r\ntheir primitive calcareous composition; and if they are embedded\r\nin soft shales, they may weather out of the rock in almost all\r\ntheir original perfection. In other cases, as in the marbles\r\nof Devonshire, the matrix is so compact and crystalline that\r\nthe included corals can only be satisfactorily studied by means\r\nof polished sections. In other cases, again, the corals have\r\nbeen more or less completely converted into flint, as in the\r\nCorniferous limestone of North America. When this is the case,\r\nthey often come, by the action of the weather, to stand out from\r\nthe enclosing rock in the boldest relief, exhibiting to the observer\r\nthe most minute details of their organization. As before, the\r\nprincipal representatives of the Corals are still referable to\r\nthe groups of the _Rugosa_ and _Tabulata_. Amongst the Rugose\r\ngroup we find a vast number of simple \"cup-corals,\" generally\r\nknown by the quarrymen as \"horns,\" from their shape. Of the many\r\nforms of these, the species of _Cyathophyllum, Heliophyllum_\r\n(fig. 82), _Zaphrentis_ (fig. 81), and _Cystiphyllum_ (fig. 80),\r\nare perhaps those most abundantly represented--none of these\r\ngenera, however, except _Heliophyllum_, being peculiar to the\r\nDevonian period. There are also numerous compound Rugose corals,\r\nsuch as species of _Eridophyllum, Diphyphyllum, Syringopora,\r\nPhillipsastroea_, and some of the forms of _Cyathophyllum_ and\r\n_Crepidophyllum_ (fig. 83). Some of these compound corals attain\r\na very large size, and form of themselves regular beds, which\r\nhave an analogy, at any rate, with existing coral-reefs, though\r\nthere are grounds for believing that these ancient types differed\r\nfrom the modern reef-builders in being inhabitants of deep water.\r\nThe \"Tabulate Corals\" are hardly less abundant in the Devonian\r\nrocks than the _Rugosa_; and being invariably compound, they\r\nhardly yield to the latter in the dimensions of the aggregations\r\nwhich they sometimes form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Portion of a mass of _Favosites\r\nGothlandica_, of the natural size. Upper Silurian and Devonian\r\nof Europe and America. (Original.) Billings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Fragment of _Favosites hemispherica_,\r\nof the natural size. Upper Silurian and Devonian of America.\r\n(After Billings.)]\r\n\r\nThe commonest, and at the same time the largest, of these are\r\nthe \"honeycomb corals,\" forming the genus _Favosites_ (figs.\r\n84, 85), which derive both their vernacular and their technical\r\nnames from their great likeness to masses of petrified honeycomb.\r\nThe most abundant species are _Favosites Gothlandica_ and _F.\r\nHemispherica_, both here figured, which form masses sometimes\r\nnot less than two or three feet in diameter. Whilst _Favosites_\r\nhas acquired a popular name by its honey-combed appearance, the\r\nresemblance of _Michelinia_ to a fossilised wasp's nest with the\r\ncomb exposed is hardly less striking, and has earned for it a\r\nsimilar recognition from the non-scientific public. In addition\r\nto these, there are numerous branching or plant-like Tabulate\r\nCorals, often of the most graceful form, which are distinctive\r\nof the Devonian in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe _Echinoderms_ of the Devonian period call for little special\r\nnotice. Many of the Devonian limestones are \"crinoidal;\" and\r\nthe _Crinoids_ are the most abundant and widely-distributed\r\nrepresentatives of their class in the deposits of this period.\r\n\r\nThe _Cystideans_, with doubtful exceptions, have not been recognised\r\nin the Devonian; and their place is taken by the allied group of\r\nthe \"Pentremites,\" which will be further spoken of as occurring\r\nin the Carboniferous rocks. On the other hand, the Star-fishes,\r\nBrittle-stars, and Sea-urchins are all continued by types more\r\nor less closely allied to those of the preceding Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\nOf the remains of Ringed-worms (_Annelides_), the most numerous\r\nand the most interesting are the calcareous envelopes of some\r\nsmall tube-inhabiting species. No one who has visited the seaside\r\ncan have failed to notice the little spiral tubes of the existing\r\n_Spirorbis_ growing attached to shells, or covering the fronds\r\nof the commoner Sea weeds (especially _Fucus serratus_). These\r\ntubes are inhabited by a small Annelide, and structures of a\r\nsimilar character occur not uncommonly from the Upper Silurian\r\nupwards. In the Devonian rocks, _Spirorbis_ is an extremely common\r\nfossil, growing in hundreds attached to the outer surface of\r\ncorals and shells, and appearing in many specific forms (figs.\r\n86 and 87); but almost all the known examples are of small size,\r\nand are liable to escape a cursory examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--a, _Spirobois omphalodes_, natural size\r\nand enlarged.

(After Salter and Burmeister.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Crustaceans_ of the Devonian are principally _Eurypterids_\r\nand _Trilobites_. Some of the former attain gigantic dimensions,\r\nand the quarrymen in the Scotch Old Red give them the name of\r\n\"seraphim\" from their singular scale-like ornamentation. The\r\n_Trilobites_, though still sufficiently abundant in some localites,\r\nhave undergone a yet further diminution since the close of the\r\nUpper Silurian. In both America and Europe quite a number of\r\ngeneric types have survived from the Silurian, but few or no\r\nnew ones make their appearance during this period in either the\r\nOld World or the New. The _species_, however, are distinct; and\r\nthe principal forms belong to the genera _Phacops_ (fig. 88, a,\r\nc, d), _Homalonotus_ (fig. 88, b), _Proetus_, and _Bronteus_.\r\nThe species figured above under the name of _Phacops latifrons_\r\n(fig. 88, a), has an almost world-wide distribution, being found\r\nin the Devonian of Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Russia,\r\nSpain, and South America; whilst its place is taken in North\r\nAmerica by the closely-allied _Phacops rana_. In addition to the\r\n_Trilobites_, the Devonian deposits have yielded the remains of a\r\nnumber of the minute _Ostracoda_, such as _Entomis_ (\"_Cypridina_\"),\r\n_Leperditia_, &c., which sometimes occur in vast numbers, as\r\nin the so-called \"_Cypridina_ Slates\" of the German Devonian.\r\nThere are also a few forms of _Phyllopods_ (_Estheria_). Taken\r\nas a whole, the Crustacean fauna of the Devonian period presents\r\nmany alliances with that of the Upper Silurian, but has only\r\nslight relationships with that of the Lower Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nBesides _Crustaceans_, we meet here for the first time with the\r\nremains of _air-breathing Articulates_, in the shape of _Insects_.\r\nSo far, these have only been obtained from the Devonian rocks of\r\nNorth America, and they indicate the existence of at least four\r\ngeneric types, all more or less allied to the existing May-flies\r\n(_Ephemeridoe_). One of these interesting primitive insects, namely,\r\n_Platephemera antiqua_ (fig. 89), appears to have measured five\r\ninches in expanse of wing; and another (_Xelloneura antiquorum_) has\r\nattached to its wing the remains of a \"stridulating-organ\" similar\r\nto that possessed by the modern Grasshoppers--the instrument, as\r\nPrincipal Dawson remarks, of \"the first music of living things\r\nthat Geology as yet reveals to us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Wing of _Platephemera antiqua_ Devonian,\r\nAmerica. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Mollusca_, the Devonian rocks have yielded a great\r\nnumber of the remains of Sea-mosses (_Polyzoa_). Some of these\r\nbelong to the ancient type _Ptilodictya_, which seems to disappear\r\nhere, or to the allied _Clathropora_ (fig. 90), with its fenestrated\r\nand reticulated fronds. We meet also with the graceful and delicate\r\nstems of _Ceriopora_ (fig. 91).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Fragment of _Clathropora intertexta_,\r\nof the natural size and enlarged.

(Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Fragment of _Fenestella cribrosa_, of\r\nthe natural size and enlarged. Dovonian, Canada. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Devonian _Polyzoa_ belong, however, to the\r\ngreat and important Palæozoic group of the Lace-corals (_Fenestella_,\r\nfigs. 92 and 94, _Retepora_, fig. 93, _Polypora_, and their allies).\r\nIn all these forms there is a horny skeleton, of a fan-like or\r\nfunnel-shaped form, which grew attached by its base to some foreign\r\nbody. The frond consists of slightly-diverging or nearly parallel\r\nbranches, which are either united by delicate cross-bars, or which\r\nbend alternately from side to side, and become directly united\r\nwith one another at short intervals--in either case giving origin\r\nto numerous oval or oblong perforations, which communicate to the\r\nwhole plant-like colony a characteristic netted and lace-like\r\nappearance. On one of its surfaces--sometimes the internal, sometimes\r\nthe external--the frond carries a number of minute chambers or\r\n\"cells,\" which are generally borne in rows on the branches, and\r\nof which each originally contained a minute animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--_Spirifera sculptilis_. Devonian, Canada.\r\n(After Billings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--_Spirifera mucronata_. Devonian, America.\r\n(After Billings.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--_Atrypa reticularis_. Upper Silurian\r\nand Devonian of Europe and America. (After Billings.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Brachiopods_ still continue to be represented in great force\r\nthrough all the Devonian deposits, though not occurring in the\r\ntrue Old Red Sandstone. Besides such old types as _Orthis,\r\nStrophomena, Lingula, Athyris_, and _Rhynchonella_, we find some\r\nentirely new ones; whilst various types which only commenced their\r\nexistence in the Upper Silurian, now undergo a great expansion\r\nand development. This last is especially the case with the two\r\nfamilies of the _Spiriferidoe_ and the _Produclidoe_. The\r\n_Spirifers_, in particular, are especially characteristic of\r\nthe Devonian, both in the Old and New Worlds--some of the most\r\ntypical forms, such as _Spirifera mucronata_ (fig. 96), having\r\nthe shell \"winged,\" or with the lateral angles prolonged to such\r\nan extent as to have earned for them the popular name of\r\n\"fossil-butterflies.\" The closely-allied _Spirifera disjunda_\r\noccurs in Britain, France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Russia, and\r\nChina. The family of the _Productidoe_ commenced to exist in the\r\nUpper Silurian, in the genus _Chonetes_, and we shall hereafter\r\nfind it culminating in the Carboniferous in many forms of the great\r\ngenus _Producta_[17] itself. In the Devonian period, there is an\r\nintermediate state of things, the genus _Chonetes_ being continued\r\nin new and varied types, and the Carboniferous _Produdoe_ being\r\nrepresented by many forms of the allied group _Productella_.\r\nAmongst other well-known Devonian Brachiopods may be mentioned\r\nthe two long-lived and persistent types _Atrypa reticularis_\r\n(fig. 97) and _Strophomena rhomboidalis_ (fig. 98). The former\r\nof these commences in the Upper Silurian, but is more abundantly\r\ndeveloped in the Devonian, having a geographical range that is\r\nnothing less than world-wide; whilst the latter commences in the\r\nLower Silurian, and, with an almost equally cosmopolitan range,\r\nsurvives into the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The name of this genus is often written _Productus_,\r\njust as _Spirifera_ is often given in the masculine gender as\r\n_Spirifer_ (the name originally given to it). The masculine\r\ntermination to these names is, however, grammatically incorrect,\r\nas the feminine noun _cochlea_ (shell) is in these cases\r\n_understood_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--_Strophomena rhomboidalis_. Lower Silurian,\r\nUpper Silurian, and Devonian of Europe and America.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Different views of _Platyceras dumosum_,\r\nof the natural size. Devonian, Canada.  (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe Bivalves (_Lamellibranchiata_) of the Devonian call for no\r\nspecial comment, the genera _Pterinea_ and _Megalodon_ being,\r\nperhaps, the most noticeable. The Univalves (_Gasteropods_), also,\r\nneed not be discussed in detail, though many interesting forms\r\nof this group are known. The type most abundantly represented,\r\nespecially in America, is _Platyceras_ (fig. 99), comprising thin,\r\nwide-mouthed shells, probably most nearly allied to the existing\r\n\"Bonnet-limpets,\" and sometimes attaining very considerable\r\ndimensions. We may also note the continuance of the genus\r\n_Euomphalus_, with its discoidal spiral shell. Amongst the\r\n_Heteropods_, the survival of _Bellerophon_ is to be recorded;\r\nand in the \"Winged-snails,\" or _Pteropods_, we find new forms\r\nof the old genera _Tentaculites_ and _Conularia_ (fig. 100).\r\nThe latter, with its fragile, conical, and often beautifully\r\nornamented shell, is especially noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--_Conularia ornata, of the natural size.\r\nDevonian, Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--_Clymenia Sedgwickii_. Devonian, Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of _Cephalopoda_ are far from uncommon in the Devonian\r\ndeposits, all the known forms being still Tetrabranchiate. Besides\r\nthe ancient types _Orthoceras_ and _Cyrtoceras_, we have now\r\na predominance of the spirally-coiled chambered shells of\r\n_Goniatites_ and _Clymenia_. In the former of these the shell is\r\nshaped like that of the _Nautilus_; but the partitions between the\r\nchambers (\"septa\") are more or less lobed, folded, or angulated,\r\nand the \"siphuncle\" runs along the _back_ or convex side of the\r\nshell--these being characters which approximate _Goniatites_ to\r\nthe true Ammonites of the later rocks. In _Clymenia_, on the\r\nother hand, whilst the shell (fig. 101) is coiled into a flat\r\nspiral, and the partitions or septa are simple or only slightly\r\nlobed, there is still this difference, as compared with the\r\n_Nautilus_, that the tube of the siphuncle is placed on the _inner_\r\nor concave side of the shell. The species of _Clymenia_ are\r\nexclusively Devonian in their range; and some of the limestones\r\nof this period in Germany are so richly charged with fossils of\r\nthis genus as to have received the name of \"Clymenien-kalk.\"\r\n\r\nThe sub-kingdom of the _Vertebrates_ is still represented by\r\n_Fishes_ only; but these are so abundant, and belong to such\r\nvaried types, that the Devonian period has been appropriately\r\ncalled the \"Age of Fishes.\" Amongst the existing fishes there are\r\nthree great groups which are of special geological importance,\r\nas being more or less extensively represented in past time. These\r\ngroups are: (1) The _Bony Fishes_ (_Teleostei_), comprising most\r\nexisting fishes, in which the skeleton is more or less completely\r\nconverted into bone; the tail is symmetrically lobed or divided\r\ninto equal moieties; and the scales are usually thin, horny,\r\nflexible plates, which overlap one another to a greater or less\r\nextent. (2) The _Ganoid Fishes_ (_Ganoidei_), comprising the modern\r\nGar-pikes, Sturgeons, &c., in which the skeleton usually more or\r\nless completely retains its primitive soft and cartilaginous\r\ncondition; the tail is generally markedly unsymmetrical, being\r\ndivided into two unequal lobes; and the scales (when present)\r\nhave the form of plates of bone, usually covered by a layer of\r\nshining enamel. These scales may overlap; or they may be rhomboidal\r\nplates, placed edge to edge in oblique rows; or they have the form\r\nof large-sized bony plates, which are commonly united in the region\r\nof the head to form a regular buckler. (3) The _Placoid Fishes_,\r\nor _Elasmobranchii_, comprising the Sharks, Rays, and _Chimoeroe_\r\nof the present day, in which the skeleton is cartilaginous; the\r\ntail is unsymmetrically lobed; and the scales have the form of\r\ndetached bony plates of variable size, scattered in the integument.\r\n\r\nIt is to the two last of these groups that the Devonian fishes\r\nbelong, and they are more specially referable to the _Ganoids_.\r\nThe order of the Ganoid fishes at the present day comprises but\r\nsome seven or eight genera, the species of which principally or\r\nexclusively inhabit fresh waters, and all of which are confined\r\nto the northern hemisphere. As compared, therefore, with the Bony\r\nfishes, which constitute the great majority of existing forms,\r\nthe Ganoids form but an extremely small and limited group. It was\r\nfar otherwise, however, in Devonian times. At this period, the\r\nbony fishes are not known to have come into existence at all, and\r\nthe Ganoids held almost undisputed possession of the waters. To\r\nwhat extent the Devonian Ganoids were confined to fresh waters\r\nremains yet to be proved; and that many of them lived in the sea\r\nis certain. It was formerly supposed that the Old Red Sandstone\r\nof Scotland and Ireland, with its abundant fish-remains, might\r\nperhaps be a fresh-water deposit, since the habitat of its fishes\r\nis uncertain, and it contains no indubitable marine fossils. It\r\nhas been now shown, however, that the marine Devonian strata\r\nof Devonshire and the continent of Europe contain some of the\r\nmost characteristic of the Old Red Sandstone fishes of Scotland;\r\nwhilst the undoubted marine deposit of the Corniferous limestone\r\nof North America contains numerous shark-like and Ganoid fishes,\r\nincluding such a characteristic Old Red genus as _Coccosleus_.\r\nThere can be little doubt, therefore, but that the majority of\r\nthe Devonian fishes were truly marine in their habits, though\r\nit is probable that many of them lived in shallow water, in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the shore, or in estuaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.--Fishes of the Devonian rocks of America.\r\na, Diagram of the jaws and teeth of _Dinichthys Hertzeri_,\r\nviewed from the front, and greatly reduced; b, Diagram of the\r\nskull of _Macropetalichthys Sullivanti_, reduced in size; c,\r\nA portion of the enamelled surface of the skull of the same,\r\nmagnified; d, One of the scales of _Onychodus sigmoides_, of\r\nthe natural size; e, One of the front teeth of the lower jaw of\r\nthe same, of the natural size: f, Fin-spine of _Machoeracanthus\r\nmajor_, a shark-like fish, reduced in size.

Old Red Sandstone,\r\nScotland. (After Agassiz.)]\r\n\r\nThe Devonian Galloids belong to a number of groups; and it is\r\nonly possible to notice a few of the most important forms here.\r\nThe modern group of the Sturgeons is represented, more or less\r\nremotely, by a few Devonian fishes--such as _Asterosteus_; and\r\nthe great _Macropetalichthys_ of the Corniferous limestone of\r\nNorth America is believed by Newberry to belong to this group. In\r\nthis fish (fig. 102, b) the skull was of large size, its outer\r\nsurface being covered with a tuberculated enamel; and, as in the\r\nexisting Sturgeons, the mouth seems to have been wholly destitute\r\nof teeth. Somewhat allied, also, to the Sturgeons, is a singular\r\ngroup of armoured fishes, which is highly characteristic of the\r\nDevonian of Britain and Europe, and less so of that of America.\r\nIn these curious forms the head and front extremity of the body\r\nwere protected by a buckler composed of large enamelled plates,\r\nmore or less firmly united to one another; whilst the hinder end\r\nof the body was naked, or was protected with small scales. Some\r\nforms of this group--such as _Pteraspis_ and _Coccosteus_--date\r\nfrom the Upper Silurian; but they attain their maximum in the\r\nDevonian, and none of them are known to pass upwards into the\r\noverlying Carboniferous rocks. Amongst the most characteristic\r\nforms of this group may be mentioned _Cephalaspis_ (fig. 103) and\r\n_Pterichthys_ (fig. 104). In the former of these the head-shield is\r\nof a crescentic shape, having its hinder angles produced backwards\r\ninto long \"horns,\" giving it the shape of a \"saddler's knife.\"\r\nNo teeth have been discovered; but the body was covered with\r\nsmall ganoid scales, and there was an unsymmetrical tail-fin.\r\nIn _Pterichthys_--which, like the preceding, was first brought\r\nto light by the labours of Hugh Miller--the whole of the head\r\nand the front part of the body were defended by a buckler of\r\nfirmly-united enamelled plates, whilst the rest of the body was\r\ncovered with small scales. The form of the \"pectoral fins\" was\r\nquite unique--these having the shape of two long, curved spines,\r\nsomewhat like wings, covered by finely-tuberculated ganoid plates.\r\nAll the preceding forms of this group are of small size; but\r\nfew fishes, living or extinct, could rival the proportions of\r\nthe great _Dinichthys_, referred to this family by Newberry.\r\nIn this huge fish (fig. 102, a) the head alone is over three\r\nfeet in length, and the body is supposed to have been twenty-five\r\nor thirty feet long. The head was protected by a massive cuirass\r\nof bony plates firmly articulated together, but the hinder end\r\nof the body seems to have been simply enveloped in a leathery\r\nskin. The teeth are of the most formidable description, consisting\r\nin both jaws of serrated dental plates behind, and in front of\r\nenormous conical tusks (fig. 102, a). Though immensely larger,\r\nthe teeth of _Dinichthys_ present a curious resemblance to those\r\nof the existing Mud-fishes (_Lepidosiren_).\r\n\r\nIn another great group of Devonian Ganoids, we meet with fishes\r\nmore or less closely allied to the living _Polypteri_ (fig. 105)\r\nof the Nile and Senegal. In this group (fig. 106) the pectoral\r\nfins consist of a central scaly lobe carrying the fin-rays on\r\nboth sides, the scales being sometimes rounded and overlapping\r\n(fig. 106), or more commonly rhomboidal and placed edge to edge\r\n(fig. 105, A). Numerous forms of these \"Fringe-finned\" Ganoids\r\noccur in the Devonian strata, such as _Holoptychius, Glyotoloemus,\r\nOsteolepis, Phaneropleuron_, &c. To this group is also to be\r\nascribed the huge _Onychodus_ (fig. 102, d and e), with its\r\nlarge, rounded, overlapping scales, an inch in diameter, and its\r\npowerful pointed teeth. It is to be remembered, however, that\r\nsome of these \"Fringe-finned\" Ganoids are probably referable\r\nto the small but singular group of the \"Mud-fishes\" (_Dipnoi_),\r\nrepresented at the present day by the singular _Lepidosiren_\r\nof South America and Africa, and the _Ceratodus_ of the rivers\r\nof Queensland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--A, _Polypterus_, a recent Ganoid\r\nfish; B, _Osteolepis_, a Devonian Ganoid; a a, Pectoral fins,\r\nshowing the fin-rays arranged round a central lobe.]\r\n\r\n[Illusration: Fig. 106.--_Holoptychius nobilissimus_, restored.\r\nOld Red Sandstone, Scotland. A, Scale of the same.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the Ganoid fishes, it still remains to be noticed that\r\nthe Devonian deposits have yielded the remains of a number of\r\nfishes more or less closely allied to the existing Sharks, Rays,\r\nand _Chimoeroe_ (the _Elasmobranchii_). The majority of the forms\r\nhere alluded to are allied not to the true Sharks and Dog-fishes,\r\nbut to the more peaceable \"Port Jackson Sharks,\" with their blunt\r\nteeth, adapted for crushing the shells of Molluscs. The collective\r\nname of \"Cestracionts\" is applied to these; and we have evidence of\r\ntheir past existence in the Devonian seas both by their teeth, and\r\nby the defensive spines which were implanted in front of a greater\r\nor less number of the fins. These are bony spines, often variously\r\ngrooved, serrated, or ornamented, with hollow bases, implanted\r\nin the integument, and capable of being erected or depressed\r\nat will. Many of these \"fin-spines\" have been preserved to us\r\nin the fossil condition, and the Devonian rocks have yielded\r\nexamples belonging to many genera. As some of the true Sharks\r\nand Dog-fishes, some of the Ganoids, and even some Bony Fishes,\r\npossess similar defences, it is often a matter of some uncertainty\r\nto what group a given spine is to be referred. One of these spines,\r\nbelonging to the genus _Machoeracanthus_, from the Devonian rocks\r\nof America, has been figured in a previous illustration (fig.\r\n102, f).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a very few words may be said as to the validity of\r\nthe Devonian series as an independent system of rocks, preserving\r\nin its successive strata the record of an independent system\r\nof life. Some high authorities have been inclined to the view\r\nthat the Devonian formation has in nature no actual existence,\r\nbut that it is made up partly of beds which should be referred\r\nto the summit of the Upper Silurian, and partly of beds which\r\nproperly belong to the base of the Carboniferous. This view seems\r\nto have been arrived at in consequence of a too exclusive study\r\nof the Devonian series of the British Isles, where the physical\r\nsuccession is not wholly clear, and where there is a striking\r\ndiscrepancy between the organic remains of those two members\r\nof the series which are known as the \"Old Red Sandstone\" and\r\nthe \"Devonian\" rocks proper. This discrepancy, however, is not\r\ncomplete; and, as we have seen, can be readily explained on the\r\nsupposition that the one group of rocks presents us with the\r\nshallow water and littoral deposits of the period, while in the\r\nother we are introduced to the deep-sea accumulations of the\r\nsame period. Nor can the problem at issue be solved by an appeal\r\nto the phenomena of the British area alone, be the testimony of\r\nthese what it may. As a matter of fact, there is at present no\r\nsufficient ground for believing that there is any irreconcilable\r\ndiscordance between the succession of rocks and of life in Britain\r\nduring the period which elapsed between the deposition of the\r\nUpper Ludlow and the formation of the Carboniferous Limestone,\r\nand the order of the same phenomena during the same period in\r\nother regions. Some of the Devonian types of life, as is the\r\ncase with all great formations, have descended unchanged from\r\nolder types; others pass upwards unchanged to the succeeding\r\nperiod: but the fauna and flora of the Devonian period are, as\r\na whole, quite distinct from those of the preceding Silurian or\r\nthe succeeding Carboniferous; and they correspond to an equally\r\ndistinct rock-system, which in point of time holds an intermediate\r\nposition between the two great groups just mentioned. As before\r\nremarked, this conclusion may be regarded as sufficiently proved\r\neven by the phenomena of the British area; but it maybe said to\r\nbe rendered a certainty by the study of the Devonian deposits of\r\nthe continent of Europe--or, still more, by the investigation of\r\nthe vast, for the most part uninterrupted and continuous series\r\nof sediments which commenced to be laid down in North America\r\nat the beginning of the Upper Silurian, and did not cease till,\r\nat any rate, the close of the Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following list comprises the more important works and memoirs\r\nto which the student of Devonian rocks and fossils may refer:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Siluria.'

Workable coal-seams, however, occur\r\nin various other formations (Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary), so\r\nthat coal is not an exclusively Carboniferous product; whilst\r\neven in the Coal-measures themselves the coal bears but a very\r\nsmall proportion to the total thickness of strata, occurring\r\nonly in comparatively thin beds intercalated in a great series\r\nof sandstones, shales, and other genuine aqueous sediments.\r\n\r\nStratigraphically, the Carboniferous rocks usually repose conformably\r\nupon the highest Devonian beds, so that the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the Carboniferous and Devonian formations is principally\r\na palæontological one, founded on the observed differences in\r\nthe fossils of the two groups. On the other hand, the close of\r\nthe Carboniferous period seems to have been generally, though\r\nnot universally, signalised by movements of the crust of the\r\nearth, so that the succeeding Permian beds often lie unconformably\r\nupon the Carboniferous sediments.\r\n\r\nStrata of Carboniferous age have been discovered in almost every\r\nlarge land-area which has been sufficiently investigated; but\r\nthey are especially largely developed in Britain, in various\r\nparts of the continent of Europe, and in North America. Their\r\ngeneral composition, however, is, comparatively speaking, so\r\nuniform, that it will suffice to take a comprehensive view of\r\nthe formation without considering any one area in detail, though\r\nin each region the subdivisions of the formation are known by\r\ndistinctive local names. Taking such a comprehensive view, it is\r\nfound that the Carboniferous series is generally divisible into a\r\n_Lower_ and essentially calcareous group (the \"Sub-Carboniferous\" or\r\n\"Carboniferous Limestone\"); a _Middle_ and principally arenaceous\r\ngroup (the \"Millstone Grit\"); and an Upper group, of alternating\r\nshales and sandstones, with workable seams of coal (the\r\n\"Coal-measures\").\r\n\r\nI. The _Carboniferous, Sub-Carboniferous_, or _Mountain Limestone\r\nSeries_ constitutes the general base of the Carboniferous system.\r\nAs typically developed in Britain, the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nis essentially a calcareous formation, sometimes consisting of a\r\nmass of nearly pure limestone from 1000 to 2000 feet in thickness,\r\nor at other times of successive great beds of limestone with\r\nsubordinate sandstones and shales. In the north of England the\r\nbase of the series consists of pebbly conglomerates and coarse\r\nsandstones; and in Scotland generally, the group is composed\r\nof massive sandstones with a comparatively feeble development\r\nof the calcareous element. In Ireland, again, the base of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone is usually considered to be formed by\r\na locally-developed group of grits and shales (the \"Coomhola\r\nGrits\" and \"Carboniferous Slate\"), which attain the thickness\r\nof about 5000 feet, and contain an intermixture of Devonian with\r\nCarboniferous types of fossils. Seeing that the Devonian formation\r\nis generally conformable to the Carboniferous, we need feel no\r\nsurprise at this intermixture of forms; nor does it appear to be\r\nof great moment whether these strata be referred to the former\r\nor to the latter series. Perhaps the most satisfactory course\r\nis to regard the Coomhola Grits and Carboniferous Slates as\r\n\"passage-beds\" between the Devonian and Carboniferous; but any\r\nview that may be taken as to the position of these beds, really\r\nleaves unaffected the integrity of the Devonian series as a distinct\r\nlife-system, which, on the whole, is more closely allied to the\r\nSilurian than to the Carboniferous. In North America, lastly,\r\nthe Sub-Carboniferous series is never purely calcareous, though\r\nin the interior of the continent it becomes mainly so. In other\r\nregions, however, it consists principally of shales and sandstones,\r\nwith subordinate beds of limestone, and sometimes with this beds\r\nof coal or deposits of clay-ironstone.\r\n\r\nII. _The Millstone Grit_.--The highest beds of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series are succeeded, generally with perfect conformity,\r\nby a series of arenaceous beds, usually known as the _Millstone\r\nGrit_. As typically developed in Britain, this group consists of\r\nhard quartzose sandstones, often so large-grained and coarse in\r\ntexture as to properly constitute fine conglomerates. In other\r\ncases there are regular conglomerates, sometimes with shales,\r\nlimestones, and thin beds of coal--the thickness of the whole\r\nseries, when well developed, varying from 1000 to 5000 feet. In\r\nNorth America, the Millstone Grit rarely reaches 1000 feet in\r\nthickness; and, like its British equivalent, consists of coarse\r\nsandstones and grits, sometimes with regular conglomerates. Whilst\r\nthe Carboniferous Limestone was undoubtedly deposited in a tranquil\r\nocean of considerable depth, the coarse mechanical sediments\r\nof the Millstone Grit indicate the progressive shallowing of\r\nthe Carboniferous seas, and the consequent supervention of\r\nshore-conditions.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Coal-measures_.--The Coal-measures properly so called\r\nrest conformably upon the Millstone Grit, and usually consist of\r\na vast series of sandstones, shales, grits, and coals, sometimes\r\nwith beds of limestone, attaining in some regions a total thickness\r\nof from 7000 to nearly 14,000 feet. Beds of workable coal are\r\nby no means unknown in some areas in the inferior group of the\r\nSub-Carboniferous; but the general statement is true, that coal is\r\nmostly obtained from the true Coal-measures--the largest known, and\r\nat present most productive coal-fields of the world being in Great\r\nBritain, North America, and Belgium. Wherever they are found, with\r\nlimited exceptions, the Coal-measures present a singular _general_\r\nuniformity of mineral composition. They consist, namely, of an\r\nindefinite alternation of beds of sandstone, shale, and coal,\r\nsometimes with bands of clay-ironstone or beds of limestone,\r\nrepeated in no constant order, but sometimes attaining the enormous\r\naggregate thickness of 14,000 feet, or little short of 3 miles.\r\nThe beds of coal differ in number and thickness in different\r\nareas, but they seldom or never exceed one-fiftieth part of the\r\ntotal bulk of the formation in thickness. The characters of the\r\ncoal itself, and the way in which the coal-beds were deposited,\r\nwill be briefly alluded to in speaking of the vegetable life\r\nof the period. In Britain, and in the Old World generally, the\r\nCoal-measures are composed partly of genuine terrestrial\r\ndeposits--such as the coal--and partly of sediments accumulated\r\nin the fresh or brackish waters of vast lagoons, estuaries, and\r\nmarshes. The fossils of the Coal-measures in these regions are\r\ntherefore necessarily the remains either of terrestrial plants\r\nand animals, or of such forms of life as inhabit fresh or brackish\r\nwaters, the occurrence of strata with marine fossils being quite\r\na local and occasional phenomenon. In various parts of North\r\nAmerica, on the other hand, the Coal-measures, in addition to\r\nsandstones, shales, coal-seams, and bands of clay-ironstone,\r\ncommonly include beds of limestone, charged with marine remains,\r\nand indicating marine conditions. The subjoined section (fig. 107)\r\ngives, in a generalised form, the succession of the Carboniferous\r\nstrata in such a British area as the north of England, where\r\nthe series is developed in a typical form.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _life_ of the Carboniferous period, we naturally\r\nfind, as has been previously noticed, great differences in different\r\nparts of the entire series, corresponding to the different mode of\r\norigin of the beds. Speaking generally, the Lower Carboniferous\r\n(or the Sub-Carboniferous) is characterised by the remains of\r\nmarine animals; whilst the Upper Carboniferous (or Coal-measures)\r\nis characterised by the remains of plants and terrestrial animals.\r\nIn all those cases, however, in which marine beds are found in\r\nthe series of the Coal-measures, as is common in America, then\r\nwe find that the fossils agree in their general characters with\r\nthose of the older marine deposits of the period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE CARBONIFEROUS\r\nSTRATA OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that coal is simply compressed and otherwise\r\naltered vegetable matter, and that it is of the highest economic\r\nvalue to man, the Coal-measures have been more thoroughly explored\r\nthan any other group of strata of equivalent thickness in the\r\nentire geological series. Hence we have already a very extensive\r\nacquaintance with the _plants_ of the Carboniferous period; and\r\nour knowledge on this subject is daily undergoing increase. It\r\nis not to be supposed, however, that the remains of plants are\r\nfound solely in Coal-measures; for though most abundant towards\r\nthe summit, they are found in less numbers in all parts of the\r\nseries. Wherever found, they belong to the same great types of\r\nvegetation; but, before reviewing these, a few words must be\r\nsaid as to the origin and mode of formation of _coal_.\r\n\r\nThe coal-beds, as before mentioned, occur interstratified with\r\nshales, sandstones, and sometimes limestones; and there may,\r\nwithin the limits of a single coal-field, be as many as 80 or\r\n100 of such beds, placed one above the other at different levels,\r\nand varying in thickness from a few inches up to 20 or 30 feet.\r\nAs a general rule, each bed of coal rests upon a bed of shale or\r\nclay, which is termed the \"under-clay,\" and in which are found\r\nnumerous roots of plants; whilst the strata immediately on the\r\ntop of the coal may be shaly or sandy, but in either case are\r\ngenerally charged with the leaves and stems of plants, and often\r\nhave upright trunks passing vertically through them. When we\r\nadd to this that the coal itself is, chemically, nearly wholly\r\ncomposed of carbon, and that its microscopic structure shows it\r\nto be composed almost entirely of fragments of stems, leaves,\r\nbark, seeds, and vegetable _débris_ derived from _land-plants_,\r\nwe are readily enabled to understand how the coal was formed.\r\nThe \"_under-clay_\" immediately beneath the coal-bed represents\r\nan old land-surface--sometimes, perhaps, the bottom of a swamp\r\nor marsh, covered with a luxuriant vegetation; the _coal bed_\r\nitself represents the slow accumulation, through long periods,\r\nof the leaves, seeds, fruits, stems, and fallen trunks of this\r\nvegetation, now hardened and compressed into a fraction of its\r\noriginal bulk by the pressure of the superincumbent rocks; and\r\nthe strata of sand or shale above the coal-bed--the so-called\r\n\"roof\" of the coal--represent sediments quietly deposited as the\r\nland, after a long period of repose, commenced to sink beneath\r\nthe sea. On this view, the rank and long-continued vegetation\r\nwhich gave rise to each coal-bed was ultimately terminated by\r\na slow depression of the surface on which the plants grew. The\r\nland-surface then became covered by the water, and aqueous sediments\r\nwere accumulated to a greater or less thickness upon the dense\r\nmass of decaying vegetation below, enveloping any trunks of trees\r\nwhich might still be in an erect position, and preserving between\r\ntheir layers the leaves and branches of plants brought down from\r\nthe neighbouring land by streams, or blown into the wafer by the\r\nwind. Finally, there set in a slow movement of elevation,--the\r\nold land again reappeared above the water; a new and equally\r\nluxuriant vegetation flourished upon the new land-surface; and\r\nanother coal-bed was accumulated, to be preserved ultimately in\r\na similar fashion. Some few beds of coal may have been formed by\r\ndrifted vegetable matter brought down into the ocean by rivers, and\r\ndeposited directly on the bottom of the sea; but in the majority\r\nof cases the coal is undeniably the result of the slow growth and\r\ndecay of plants _in situ_: and as the plants of the coal are\r\nnot _marine_ plants, it is necessary to adopt some such theory\r\nas the above to account for the formation of coal-seams. By this\r\ntheory, as is obvious, we are compelled to suppose that the vast\r\nalluvial and marshy flats upon which the coal-plants grew were\r\nliable to constantly-recurring oscillations of level, the successive\r\nland-surfaces represented by the successive coal-beds of any\r\ncoal-field being thus successively buried beneath accumulations\r\nof mud or sand. We have no need, however, to suppose that these\r\noscillations affected large areas at the same time; and geology\r\nteaches us that local elevations and depressions of the land\r\nhave been matters of constant occurrence throughout the whole\r\nof past time.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of coal (bituminous coal, anthracite; cannel-coal,\r\n&c.) show a more or less distinct \"lamination\"--that is to say,\r\nthey are more or less obviously composed of successive thin layers,\r\ndiffering slightly in colour and texture. All the varieties of coal,\r\nalso, consist chemically of _carbon_, with varying proportions of\r\ncertain gaseous constituents and a small amount of incombustible\r\nmineral or \"ash.\" By cutting thin and transparent slices of coal,\r\nwe are further enabled, by means of the microscope, to ascertain\r\nprecisely not only that the carbon of the coal is derived from\r\nvegetables, but also, in many cases, what kinds of plants, and what\r\nparts of these, enter into the formation of coal. When examined\r\nin this way, all coals are found to consist more or less entirely\r\nof vegetable matter; but there is considerable difference in\r\ndifferent coals as to the exact nature of this. By Professor\r\nHuxley it has been shown that many of the English coals consist\r\nlargely of accumulations of rounded discoidal sacs or bags, which\r\nare unquestionably the seed-vessels or \"spore-cases\" of certain\r\nof the commoner coal-plants (such as the _Lepidodendra_). The\r\nbest bituminous coals seem to be most largely composed of these\r\nspore-cases; whilst inferior kinds possess a progressively increasing\r\namount of the dull carbonaceous substance which is known as \"mineral\r\ncharcoal,\" and which is undoubtedly composed of \"the stems and\r\nleaves of plants reduced to little more than their carbon.\" On\r\nthe other hand, Principal Dawson finds that the American coals\r\nonly occasionally exhibit spore-cases to any extent, but consist\r\nprincipally of the cells, vessels, and fibres of the bark,\r\nintegumentary coverings, and woody portions of the Carboniferous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe number of plants already known to have existed during the\r\nCarboniferous period is so great, that nothing more can be done\r\nhere than to notice briefly the typical and characteristic _groups_\r\nof these--such as the Ferns, the Calamites, the Lepidodendroids,\r\nthe Sigillarioids, and the Conifers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--_Odontopteris Schlotheimii_. Carboniferous,\r\nEurope and North America.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109.--_Calamites cannoeformis_. Carboniferous\r\nRocks, Europe and North America.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with M. Brongniart's generalisation, that the Palæozoic\r\nperiod is, botanically speaking, the \"Age of Acrogens,\" we find\r\nthe Carboniferous plants to be still mainly referable to the\r\nFlowerless or \"Cryptogamous\" division of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nThe flowering or \"Phanerogamous\" plants, which form the bulk\r\nof our existing vegetation, are hardly known, with certainty,\r\nto have existed at all in the Carboniferous era, except as\r\nrepresented by trees related to the existing Pines and Firs,\r\nand possibly by the Cycads or \"false palms.\"[18] Amongst the\r\n\"Cryptogams,\" there is no more striking or beautiful group of\r\nCarboniferous plants than the _Ferns_. Remains of these are found\r\nall through the Carboniferous, but in exceptional numbers in\r\nthe Coal-measures, and include both herbaceous forms like the\r\nmajority of existing species, and arborescent forms resembling\r\nthe living Tree-ferns of New Zealand. Amongst the latter, together\r\nwith some new types, are examples of the genera _Psaronius_ and\r\n_Caulopteris_, both of which date from the Devonian. The simply\r\nherbaceous ferns are extremely numerous, and belong to such\r\nwidely-distributed and largely-represented genera as _Neuropteris,\r\nOdontopteris_ (fig. 108), _Alethopteris, Pecopteris, Sphenopteris,\r\nHymenophyllites_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Whilst the vegetation of the Coal-period was mainly\r\na terrestrial one, aquatic plants are not unknown. Sea-weeds\r\n(such as the _Spirophyton cauda-Galli_) are common in some of\r\nthe marine strata; whilst coal, according to the researches of\r\nthe Abbé Castracane, is asserted commonly to contain the siliceous\r\nenvelopes of Diatoms.]\r\n\r\nThe fossils known as _Calamites_ (fig. 109) are very common in\r\nthe Carboniferous deposits, and have given occasion to an abundance\r\nof research and speculation. They present themselves as prostrate\r\nand flattened striated stems, or as similar uncompressed stems\r\ngrowing in an erect position, and sometimes attaining a length\r\nof twenty feet or more. Externally, the stems are longitudinally\r\nribbed, with transverse joints at regular intervals, these joints\r\ngiving origin to a whorl or branchlets, which mayor may not give\r\norigin to similar whorls of smaller branchlets still. The stems,\r\nfurther, were hollow, with transverse partitions at the joints,\r\nand having neither true wood nor bark, but only a thin external\r\nfibrous shell. There can be little doubt but that the _Calamites_\r\nare properly regarded as colossal representatives of the little\r\nHorse-tails (_Equisetaceoe_) of the present day. They agree with\r\nthese not only in the general details of their organisation, but\r\nalso in the fact that the fruit was a species of cone, bearing\r\n\"spore-cases\" under scales. According to Principal Dawson, the\r\n_Calamites_ \"grew in dense brakes on the sandy and muddy flats,\r\nsubject to inundation, or perhaps even in water; and they had\r\nthe power of budding out from the base of the stem, so as to\r\nform clumps of plants, and also of securing their foothold by\r\nnumerous cord-like roots proceeding from various heights on the\r\nlower part of the stem.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110.--_Lepidodendron Sternbergii_, Carboniferous,\r\nEurope. The central figure represents a portion of the trunk with\r\nits branches, much reduced in size. The right-hand figure is\r\na portion of a branch with the leaves partially attached to it;\r\nand the left-hand figure represents the end of a branch bearing\r\na cone of fructification.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidodendroids_, represented mainly by the genus\r\n_Lepidodendron_ itself (fig. 110), were large tree-like plants,\r\nwhich attain their maximum in the Carboniferous period, but which\r\nappear to commence in the Upper Silurian, are well represented in\r\nthe Devonian, and survive in a diminished form into the Permian.\r\nThe trunks of the larger species of _Lepidodendron_ at times\r\nreach a length of fifty feet and upwards, giving off branches in\r\na regular bifurcating manner. The bark is marked with numerous\r\nrhombic or oval scars, arranged in quincunx order, and indicating\r\nthe points where the long, needle-shaped leaves were formerly\r\nattached. The fruit consisted of cones or spikes, carried at the\r\nends of the branches, and consisting of a central axis surrounded\r\nby overlapping scales, each of which supports a \"spore-case\"\r\nor seed-vessel. These cones have commonly been described under\r\nthe name of _Lepidostrobi_. In the structure of the trunk there\r\nis nothing comparable to what is found in existing trees, there\r\nbeing a thick bark surrounding a zone principally composed of\r\n\"scalariform\" vessels, this in turn enclosing a large central\r\npith. In their general appearance the _Lepidodendra_ bring to mind\r\nthe existing Araucarian Pines; but they are true \"Cryptogams,\"\r\nand are to be regarded as a gigantic extinct type of the modern\r\nClub-mosses (_Lycopodiaceoe_). They are amongst the commonest\r\nand most characteristic of the Carboniferous plants; and the\r\nmajority of the \"spore-cases\" so commonly found in the coal appear\r\nto have been derived from the cones of Lepidodendroids.\r\n\r\nThe so-called _Sigillanoids_, represented mainly by _Sigillaria_\r\nitself (fig. 111), were no less abundant and characteristic of\r\nthe Carboniferous forests than the _Lepidodendra_. They commence\r\ntheir existence, so far as known, in the Devonian period, but\r\nthey attain their maximum in the Carboniferous; and--unlike the\r\nLepidodendroids--they are not known to occur in the Permian period.\r\nThey are comparatively gigantic in size, often attaining a height\r\nof from thirty to fifty feet or more; but though abundant and\r\nwell preserved, great divergence of opinion prevails as to their\r\ntrue affinities. The _name_ of Sigillarioids (Lat. _sigilla_,\r\nlittle seals or images) is derived from the fact that the bark\r\nis marked with seal-like impressions or leaf-scars (fig. 111).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111.--Fragment of the external surface of\r\n_Sigillaria Groeseri_, showing the ribs and leaf-scars. The left-hand\r\nfigure represents a small portion enlarged. Carboniferous, Europe.]\r\n\r\nExternally, the trunks of _Sigillaria_ present strong longitudinal\r\nridges, with vertical alternating rows of oval leaf-scars indicating\r\nthe points where the leaves were originally attached. The trunk\r\nwas furnished with a large central pith, a thick outer bark,\r\nand an intermediate woody zone,--composed, according to Dawson,\r\npartly of the disc-bearing fibres so characteristic of Conifers;\r\nbut, according to Carruthers, entirely made up of the \"scalariform\"\r\nvessels characteristic of Cryptogams. The size of the pith was\r\nvery great, and the bark seems to have been the most durable\r\nportion of the trunk. Thus we have evidence that in many cases\r\nthe stumps and \"stools\" of _Sigillarioe_, standing upright in\r\nthe old Carboniferous swamps, were completely hollowed out by\r\ninternal decay, till nothing but an exterior shell of bark was\r\nleft. Often these hollow stumps became ultimately filled up with\r\nsediment, sometimes enclosing the remains of galley-worms,\r\nland-snails, or Amphibians, which formerly found in the cavity\r\nof the trunk a congenial home; and from the sandstone or shale\r\nnow filling such trunks some of the most interesting fossils of\r\nthe Coal-period have been obtained. There is little certainty\r\nas to either the leaves or fruits of _Sigillaria_, and there\r\nis equally little certainty as to the true botanical position\r\nof these plants. By Principal Dawson they are regarded as being\r\nprobably flowering plants allied to the existing \"false palms\"\r\nor \"_Cycads_,\" but the high authority of Mr Carruthers is to\r\nbe quoted in support of the belief that they are Cryptogamic,\r\nand most nearly allied to the Club-mosses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112.--_Stigmaria ficoides_. Quarter natural\r\nsize. Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the botanical position of _Sigillaria_ thus undecided, we\r\nfind that it is now almost universally conceded that the fossils\r\noriginally described under the name of _Stigmaria_ are the _roots_\r\nof _Sigillaria_, the actual connection between the two having been\r\nin numerous instances demonstrated in an unmistakable manner.\r\nThe _Stigmarioe_ (fig. 112) ordinarily present themselves in\r\nthe form of long, compressed or rounded fragments, the external\r\nsurface of which is covered with rounded pits or shallow tubercles,\r\neach of which has a little pit or depression in its centre. From\r\neach of these pits there proceeds, in perfect examples, a long\r\ncylindrical rootlet; but in many cases these have altogether\r\ndisappeared. In their internal structure, _Stigmaria_ exhibits\r\na central pith surrounded by a sheath of scalariform vessels,\r\nthe whole enclosed in a cellular envelope. The _Stigmarioe_ are\r\ngenerally found ramifying in the \"under-clay,\" which forms the\r\nfloor of a bed of coal, and which represents the ancient soil\r\nupon which the _Sigillarioe_ grew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113.--_Trigonocarpon ovatum_. Coal-measures,\r\nBritain. (After Liudley and Hutton.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidodendroids and Sigillaroids, though the first were\r\ncertainly, and the second possibly, Cryptogamic or flowerless\r\nplants, must have constituted the main mass of the forests of\r\nthe Coal period; but we are not without evidence of the existence\r\nat the same time of genuine \"trees,\" in the technical sense of\r\nthis term--namely, flowering plants with large woody stems. So\r\nfar as is certainly known, all the true trees of the Carboniferous\r\nformation were _Conifers_, allied to the existing Pines and Firs.\r\nThey are recognised by the great size and concentric woody rings\r\nof their prostrate, rarely erect trunks, and by the presence\r\nof disc-bearing fibres in their wood, as demonstrated by the\r\nmicroscope; and the principal genera which have been recognised\r\nare _Dadoxylon, Paloeoxylon, Araucarioxylon_, and _Pinites_.\r\nTheir fruit is not known with absolute certainty, unless it be\r\nrepresented, as often conjectured, by _Trigonocarpon_ (fig. 113).\r\nThe fruits known under this name are nut-like, often of considerable\r\nsize, and commonly three- or six-angled. They probably originally\r\npossessed a fleshy envelope; and if truly referable to the\r\n_Conifers_, they would indicate that these ancient evergreens\r\nproduced berries instead of cones, and thus resembled the modern\r\nYews rather than Pines. It seems, further, that the great group\r\nof the _Cycads_, which are nearly allied to the _Conifers_, and\r\nwhich attained such a striking prominence in the Secondary period,\r\nprobably commenced its existence during the Coal period; but\r\nthese anticipatory forms are comparatively few in number, and\r\nfor the most part of somewhat dubious affinities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD--Continued.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE OF THE CARBONIFEROUS.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there exists a great difference as to the mode\r\nof origin of the Carboniferous sediments, some being purely marine,\r\nwhilst others are terrestrial; and others, again, have been formed\r\nin inland swamps and morasses, or in brackish-water lagoons,\r\ncreeks, or estuaries. A corresponding difference exists necessarily\r\nin the animal remains of these deposits, and in many regions\r\nthis difference is extremely well marked and striking. The great\r\nmarine limestones which characterise the lower portion of the\r\nCarboniferous series in Britain, Europe, and the eastern portion\r\nof America, and the calcareous beds which are found high up in\r\nthe Carboniferous in the western States of America, may, and\r\ndo, often contain the remains of drifted plants; but they are\r\nessentially characterised by marine fossils; and, moreover, they\r\ncan be demonstrated by the microscope to be almost wholly composed\r\nof the remains of animals which formerly inhabited the ocean. On\r\nthe other hand, the animal remains of the beds accompanying the\r\ncoal are typically the remains of air-breathing, terrestrial,\r\namphibious, or aerial animals, together with those which inhabit\r\nfresh or brackish waters. Marine fossils may be found in the\r\nCoal-measures, but they are invariably confined to special horizons\r\nin the strata, and they indicate temporary depressions of the\r\nland beneath the sea. Whilst the distinction here mentioned is\r\none which cannot fail to strike the observer, it is convenient\r\nto consider the animal life of the Carboniferous as a whole: and\r\nit is simply necessary, in so doing, to remember that the marine\r\nfossils are in general derived from the inferior portion of the\r\nsystem; whilst the air-breathing, fresh-water, and brackish-water\r\nforms are almost exclusively derived from the superior portion\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114.--Transparent slice of Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, from Spergen Hill, Indiana, U.S., showing numerous\r\nshells of _Endothyra_ (_Rotalia_), _Baiteyi_ slightly enlarged.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115.--_Fusulina cylindrica_, Carboniferous\r\nLimestone, Russia.]\r\n\r\nThe Carboniferous _Protozoans_ consist mainly of _Foraminifera_\r\nand _Sponges_. The latter are still very insufficiently known,\r\nbut the former are very abundant, and belong to very varied types.\r\nThin slices of the limestones of the period, when examined by the\r\nmicroscope, very commonly exhibit the shells of _Foraminifera_\r\nin greater or less plenty. Some limestones, indeed, are made up of\r\nlittle else than these minute and elegant shells, often belonging\r\nto types, such as the Textularians and Rotalians, differing little\r\nor not at all from those now in existence. This is the case, for\r\nexample, with the Carboniferous Limestone of Spergen Hill in\r\nIndiana (fig. 114), which is almost wholly made up of the spiral\r\nshells of a species of _Endothyra_. In the same way, though to a\r\nless extent, the black Carboniferous marbles of Ireland, and\r\nthe similar marbles of Yorkshire, the limestones of the west\r\nof England and of Derbyshire, and the great \"Scar Limestones\" of\r\nthe north of England, contain great numbers of Foraminiferous\r\nshells; whilst similar organisms commonly occur in the shale-beds\r\nassociated with the limestones throughout the Lower Carboniferous\r\nseries. One of the most interesting of the British Carboniferous\r\nforms is the _Saccammina_ of Mr Henry Brady, which is sometimes\r\npresent in considerable numbers in the limestones of Northumberland,\r\nCumberland, and the west of Scotland, and which is conspicuous\r\nfor the comparatively large size of its spheroidal or pear-shaped\r\nshell (reaching from an eighth to a fifth of an inch in size).\r\nMore widely distributed are the generally spindle-shaped shells\r\nof _Fusulina_ (fig. 115), which occur in vast numbers in the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone of Russia, Armenia, the Southern Alps,\r\nand Spain, similar forms occurring in equal profusion in the\r\nhigher limestones which are found in the Coal-measures of the\r\nUnited States, in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, &c. Mr Henry\r\nBrady, lastly, has shown that we have in the _Nummulina Pristina_\r\nof the Carboniferous Limestone of Namur a genuine _Nummulite_,\r\nprecursor of the great and important family of the Tertiary\r\nNummulites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116--Corals of the Carboniferous Limestone.\r\na. _Cyathophyllum paracida_, showing young corallites budded\r\nforth from the disc of the old one; a', One of the corallites\r\nof the same, seen in cross-section; b, Fragment of a mass of\r\n_Lithostrotion irregulare_; b', One of the corallites of the\r\nsame, divided transversely; c, Portion of the simple cylindrical\r\ncoral of _Amplexus coralloides_; c', Transverse section of the\r\nsame species; d, _Zaphrentis vermicularis_, showing the depression\r\nor \"fossula\" on one side of the cup; e, Fragrent of a mass of\r\n_Syringopora ramulosa_; f, Fragment of _Coetetes tumidus_; f',\r\nPortion of the same of the same, enlarged.

(After Thomson, De Koninck,\r\nMilne-Edwards and Haime, and the Author.)]\r\n\r\nThe sub-kingdom of the _Coelenterates_, so far as certainly known,\r\nis represented only by _Corals_;[19] but the remains of these are\r\nso abundant in many of the limestones of the Carboniferous formation\r\nas to constitute a feature little or not at all less conspicuous\r\nthan that afforded by the Crinoids. As is the case in the preceding\r\nperiod, the Corals belong, almost exclusively, to the groups of\r\nthe _Rugosa_ and _Tabulata_; and there is a general and striking\r\nresemblance and relationship between the coral-fauna of the Devonian\r\nas a whole, and that of the Carboniferous. Nevertheless, there\r\nis an equally decided and striking amount of difference between\r\nthese successive faunas, due to the fact that the great majority\r\nof the Carboniferous _species_ are new; whilst some of the most\r\ncharacteristic Devonian _genera_ have nearly or quite disappeared,\r\nand several new genera now make their appearance for the first\r\ntime. Thus, the characteristic Devonian types _Heliophyllum,\r\nPachyphyllum, Chonophyllum, Acervularia, Spongophyllum, Smithia,\r\nEndophyllum_, and _Cystiphyllum_, have now disappeared; and the\r\ngreat masses of _Favosites_ which are such a striking feature\r\nin the Devonian limestones, are represented but by one or two\r\ndegenerate and puny successors. On the other hand, we meet in\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks not only with entirely new genera--such\r\nas _Axophyllum, Lophophyllum_, and _Londsdaleia_--but we have an\r\nenormous expansion of certain types which had just begun to exist\r\nin the preceding period. This is especially well seen in the Case\r\nof the genus _Lithostrotion_ (fig. 116, b), which more than any\r\nother may be considered as the predominant Carboniferous group of\r\nCorals. All the species of _Lithostrotion_ are compound, consisting\r\neither of bundles of loosely-approximated cylindrical stems, or of\r\nsimilar \"coral-lites\" closely aggregated together into astræiform\r\ncolonies, and rendered polygonal by mutual pressure. This genus\r\nhas a historical interest, as having been noticed as early as in\r\nthe year 1699 by Edward Lhwyd; and it is geologically important\r\nfrom its wide distribution in the Carboniferous rocks of both the\r\nOld and New Worlds. Many species are known, and whole beds of\r\nlimestone are often found to be composed of little else than\r\nthe skeletons of these ancient corals, still standing upright\r\nas they grew. Hardly less characteristic of the Carboniferous\r\nthan the above is the great group of simple \"cup-corals,\" of\r\nwhich _Clisiophyllum_ is the central type. Amongst types which\r\ncommenced in the Silurian and Devonian, but which are still well\r\nrepresented here, may be mentioned _Syringopora_ (fig. 116, e),\r\nwith its colonies of delicate cylindrical tubes united at intervals\r\nby cross-bars; _Zaphrentis_ (fig. 116, d), with its cup-shaped\r\nskeleton and the well-marked depression (or \"fossula\") on one side\r\nof the calice; _Amplexus_ (fig. 116, c), with its cylindrical,\r\noften irregularly swollen coral and short septa; _Cyathophyllum_\r\n(fig. 116, a), sometimes simple, sometimes forming great masses\r\nof star-like corallites; and _Choetetes_, with its branched stems,\r\nand its minute, \"tabulate\" tubes (fig. 116, f). The above,\r\ntogether with other and hardly less characteristic forms, combine\r\nto constitute a coral-fauna which is not only in itself perfectly\r\ndistinctive, but which is of especial interest, from the fact that\r\nalmost all the varied types of which it is composed disappeared\r\nutterly before the close of the Carboniferous period. In the\r\nfirst marine sediments of a calcareous nature which succeeded to\r\nthe Coal-measures (the magnesian limestones of the Permian), the\r\ngreat group of the _Rugose corals_, which flourished so largely\r\nthroughout the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous periods,\r\nis found to have all but disappeared, and it is never again\r\nrepresented save sporadically and by isolated forms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: A singular fossil has been described by Professor\r\nMartin Duncan and Mr Jenkins from the Carboniferous rocks under\r\nthe name of _Paloeocoryne_, and has been referred to the Hydroid\r\nZoophytes (_Corynida_). Doubt, however, has been thrown by other\r\nobservers on the correctness of this reference.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117.--_Platycrinus tricontadactylus_, Lower\r\nCarboniferous.

Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Echinoderms_, by far the most important forms are\r\nthe Sea-lilies and the Sea-urchins--the former from their great\r\nabundance, and the latter from their singular structure; but the\r\nlittle group of the \"Pentremites\" also requires to be noticed.\r\nThe Sea-lilies are so abundant in the Carboniferous rocks, that it\r\nhas been proposed to call the earlier portion of the period the\r\n\"Age of Crinoids.\" Vast masses of the limestones of the period\r\nare \"crinoidal,\" being more or less extensively composed of the\r\nbroken columns, and detached plates and joints of Sea-lilies,\r\nwhilst perfect \"heads\" may be exceedingly rare and difficult\r\nto procure. In North America the remains of Crinoids are even\r\nmore abundant at this horizon than in Britain, and the specimens\r\nfound seem to be commonly more perfect. The commonest of the\r\nCarboniferous Crinoids belong to the genera _Cyathocrinus,\r\nActinocrinus, Platycrinus_, (fig. 117), _Poteriocrinus, Zeacrinus_,\r\nand _Forbesiocrinus_. Closely allied to the Crinoids, or forming\r\na kind of transition between these and the Cystideans, is the\r\nlittle group of the \"Pentremites,\" or _Blastoids_ (fig. 118).\r\nThis group is first known to have commenced its existence in\r\nthe Upper Silurian, and it increased considerably in numbers\r\nin the Devonian; but it was in the seas of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod that it attained its maximum, and no certain representative\r\nof the family has been detected in any later deposits. The\r\n\"Pentremites\" resemble the Crinoids in having a cup-shaped body\r\n(fig. 118, A) enclosed by closely-fitting calcareous plates,\r\nand supported on a short stem or \"column,\" composed of numerous\r\ncalcareous pieces flexibly articulated together. They differ from\r\nthe Crinoids, however, in the fact that the upper surface of\r\nthe body does not support the crown of branched feathery \"arms,\"\r\nwhich are so characteristic of the latter. On the contrary, the\r\nsummit of the cup is closed up in the fashion of a flower-bud,\r\nwhence the technical name of _Blastoidea_ applied to the group\r\n(Gr. _blastos_, a bud; _eidos_, form). From the top of the cup\r\nradiate five broad, transversely-striated areas (fig. 118, C),\r\neach with a longitudinal groove down its middle; and along each\r\nside of each of these grooves there seems to have been attached\r\na row of short jointed calcareous filaments or \"pinnules.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119.--_Paloechinus ellipticus_, one of the\r\nCarboniferous Sea-urchins. The left-hand figure shows one of the\r\n\"ambulacral areas\" enlarged, exhibiting the perforated plates.\r\nThe right-land figure exhibits a single plate from one of the\r\n\"inter-ambulacral areas.\" (After M'Coy.)]\r\n\r\nA few Star-fishes and Brittle-stars are known to occur in the\r\nCarboniferous rocks; but the only other Echinodemls of this period\r\nwhich need be noticed are the Sea-urchins (_Echinoids_). Detached\r\nplates and spines of these are far from rare in the Carboniferous\r\ndeposits; but anything like perfect specimens are exceedingly\r\nscarce. The Carboniferous Sea-urchins agree with those of the\r\npresent day in having the body enclosed in a shell formed by\r\nan enormous number of calcareous plates articulated together.\r\nThe shell may be regarded as, typically, nearly spherical in\r\nshape, with the mouth in the centre of the base, and the excretory\r\nopening or vent at its summit. In both the ancient forms and the\r\nrecent ones, the plates of the shell are arranged in ten zones\r\nwhich generally radiate from the summit to the centre of the base.\r\nIn five of these zones--termed the \"ambulacral areas\"--the plates\r\nare perforated by minute apertures or \"pores,\" through which\r\nthe animal can protrude the little water-tubes (\"tube-feet\") by\r\nwhich its locomotion is carried on. In the other five zones--the\r\nso-called \"inter-ambulacral areas\"--the plates are of larger\r\nsize, and are not perforated by any apertures. In all the modern\r\nSea-urchins each of these ten zones, whether perforate or\r\nimperforate, is composed of two rows of plates; and there are\r\nthus twenty rows of plates in all. In the Palæozoic Sea-urchins,\r\non the other hand, the \"ambulacral areas\" are often like those of\r\nrecent forms, in consisting of _two_ rows of perforated plates\r\n(fig. 119); but the \"inter-ambulacral areas\" are always quite\r\npeculiar in consisting each of three, four, five, or more rows\r\nof large imperforate plates, whilst there are sometimes four\r\nor ten rows of plates in the \"ambulacral areas\" also: so that\r\nthere are many more than twenty rows of plates in the entire\r\nshell. Some of the Palæozoic Sea-urchins, also, exhibit a very\r\npeculiar singularity of structure which is only known to exist\r\nin a very few recently-discovered modern forms (viz., _Calveria_\r\nand _Phormosoma_). The plates of the inter-ambulacral areas,\r\nnamely, overlap one another in an imbricating manner, so as to\r\ncommunicate a certain amount of flexibility to the shell; whereas\r\nin the ordinary living forms these plates are firmly articulated\r\ntogether by their edges, and the shell forms a rigid immovable\r\nbox. The Carboniferous Sea-urchins which exhibit this extraordinary\r\npeculiarity belong to the genera _Lepidechinus_ and _Lepidesthes_,\r\nand it seems tolerably certain that a similar flexibility of\r\nthe shell existed to a less degree in the much more abundant\r\ngenus _Archoeocidaris_. The Carboniferous Sea-urchins, like the\r\nmodern ones, possessed movable spines of greater or less length,\r\narticulated to the exterior of the shell; and these structures\r\nare of very common occurrence in a detached condition. The most\r\nabundant genera are _Archoeocidaris_ and _Paloechinus_; but the\r\ncharacteristic American forms belong principally to _Melonites,\r\nOligoporus_, and _Lepidechinus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120.--_Spirorbis (Microconchus) Carbonarius_,\r\nof the natural size, attached to a fossil plant, and magnified.\r\nCarboniferous Britain and North America. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Annelides_ it is only necessary to notice the little\r\nspiral tubes of _Spirorbis Carbonarius_ (fig. 120), which are\r\ncommonly found attached to the leaves or stems of the Coal-plants.\r\nThis fact shows that though the modern species of _Spirorbis_\r\nare inhabitants of the sea, these old representatives of the\r\ngenus must have been capable of living in the brackish waters\r\nof lagoons and estuaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121.--_Prestwichia rotundata_, a Limuloid\r\nCrustacean. Coal-measures, Britain. (After Henry Woodward.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122.--Crustaceans of the Carboniferous Rocks.\r\na, _Phillipsia seminifera_, of the natural size--Mountain Limestone,\r\nEurope; b, One valve of the shell of _Estheria tenella_, of the\r\nnatural size and enlarged--Coal-measures, Europe; c, Bivalved\r\nshell of _Entomoconchus Scouleri_, of the natural size--Mountain\r\nLimestone, Europe; d, _Dithyrocaris Scouleri_, reduced in\r\nsize--Mountain Limestone, Ireland; e, _Paloeocaris typus_, slightly\r\nenlarged--Coal-measures, North America; f, _Anthrapaloemon gracilis_,\r\nof the natural size--Coal-measures, North America. (After De\r\nKoninck, M'Coy, Rupert Jones, and Meek and Worthen.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Crustaceans_ of the Carboniferous rocks are numerous, and\r\nbelong partly to structural types with which we are already familiar,\r\nand partly to higher groups which come into existence here for the\r\nfirst time. The gigantic _Eurypterids_ of the Upper Silurian and\r\nDevonian are but feebly represented, and make their final exit\r\nhere from the scene of life. Their place, however, is taken by\r\npeculiar forms belonging to the allied group of the _Xiphosura_,\r\nrepresented at the present day by the King-crabs or \"Horse-shoe\r\nCrabs\" (_Limulus_). Characteristic forms of this group appear\r\nin the Coal-measures both of Europe and America; and though\r\nconstituting three distinct genera (_Prestwichia, Belinurus_,\r\nand _Euproöps_), they are all nearly related to one another. The\r\nbest known of them, perhaps, is the _Prestwichia rotundala_ of\r\nCoalbrookdale, here figured (fig. 121). The ancient and formerly\r\npowerful order of the _Trilobites_ also undergoes its final\r\nextinction here, not surviving the deposition of the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone series in Europe, but extending its range in America\r\ninto the Coal-measures. All the known Carboniferous forms are\r\nsmall in size and degraded in point of structure, and they are\r\nreferable to but three genera (_Phillipsia, Griffithides_, and\r\n_Brachymetopus_), belonging to a single family. The _Phillipsia\r\nseminifera_ here figured (fig. 122, a) is a characteristic species\r\nin the Old World. The Water-fleas (_Ostracoaa_) are extremely\r\nabundant in the Carboniferous rocks, whole strata being often\r\nmade up of little else than the little bivalved shells of these\r\nCrustaceans. Many of them are extremely small, averaging about\r\nthe size of a millet-seed; but a few forms, such as _Entomoconchus\r\nScouleni_ (fig. 122, c), may attain a length of from one to\r\nthree quarters of an inch. The old group of the _Phyllopods_\r\nis is likewise still represented in some abundance, partly by\r\ntailed forms of a shrimp-like appearance, such as _Dithyrocaris_\r\n(fig. 122, d), and partly by the curious striated _Estherioe_\r\nand their allies, which present a curious resemblance to the\r\ntrue Bivalve Molluscs (fig. 122, b). Lastly, we meet for the\r\nfirst time in the Carboniferous rocks with the remains of the\r\nhighest of all the groups of _Crustaceans_--namely, the so-called\r\n\"Decapods,\" in which there are five pairs of walking-limbs, and\r\nthe hinder end of the body (\"abdomen\") is composed of separate\r\nrings, whilst the anterior end is covered by a head-shield or\r\n\"carapace.\" All the Carboniferous Decapods hitherto discovered\r\nresemble the existing Lobsters, Prawns, and Shrimps (the _Macrura_),\r\nin having a long and well-developed abdomen terminated by an\r\nexpanded tail-fin. The _Paloeocaris typus_ (fig. 122, e) and the\r\n_Anthrapaloemon gracilis_ (fig. 122, f), from the Coal-measures\r\nof Illinois, are two of the best understood and most perfectly\r\npreserved of the few known representatives of the \"Long-tailed\"\r\nDecapods in the Carboniferous series. The group of the Crabs\r\nor \"Short-tailed\" Decapods (_Brachyura_), in which the abdomen\r\nis short, not terminated by a tail-fin, and tucked away out of\r\nsight beneath the body, is at present not known to be represented\r\nat all in the Carboniferous deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123.--_Cyclophthalmus senior_. A fossil Scorpion\r\nfrom the Coal-measures of Bohemia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124.--_Xylobius Sigillarioe_, a Carboniferous\r\nMyriapod. a, A specimen, of the natural size; b, Anterior\r\nportion of the same, enlarged; c, Posterior portion, enlarged.\r\nFrom the Coal-measures of Nova Scotia. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125--_Haplophlebium Barnesi_, a Carboniferous\r\ninsect, from the Coal-meastures of Nova Scotia. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the water-inhabiting group of the Crustaceans, we\r\nfind the articulate animals to be represented by members belonging\r\nto the air-breathing classes of the _Arachnida, Myriapoda_, and\r\n_Insecta_. The remains of these, as might have been expected, are\r\nnot known to occur in the marine limestones of the Carboniferous\r\nseries, but are exclusively found in beds associated with the Coal,\r\nwhich have been deposited in lagoons, estuaries, or marshes, in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the land, and which actually represent\r\nan old land-surface. The _Arachnids_ are at present the oldest\r\nknown of their class, and are represented both by true Spiders\r\nand Scorpions. Remains of the latter (fig. 123) have been found\r\nboth in the Old and New Worlds, and indicate the existence in\r\nthe Carboniferous period of Scorpions differing but very little\r\nfrom existing forms. The group of the _Myriapoda_, including\r\nthe recent Centipedes and Galley-worms, is likewise represented\r\nin the Carboniferous strata, but by forms in many respects very\r\nunlike any that are known to exist at the present day. The most\r\ninteresting of these were obtained by Principal Dawson, along\r\nwith the bones of Amphibians and the shells of Land-snails, in\r\nthe sediment filling the hollow trunks of _Sigillaria_, and they\r\nbelong to the genera _Xylobius_ (fig. 124) and Archiulus. Lastly,\r\nthe true _insects_ are represented by various forms of Beetles\r\n(_Coleoptera_), _Orthoptera_ (such as Cockroaches), and\r\n_Neuropterous_ insects resembling those which we have seen to\r\nhave existed towards the close of the Devonian period. One of the\r\nmost remarkable of the latter is a huge May-fly (_Haplophlebium\r\nBarnesi_, fig. 125), with netted wings attaining an expanse of\r\nfully seven inches, and therefore much exceeding any existing\r\nEphemerid in point of size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126.--Carboniferous _Polyzoa_. a, Fragment\r\nof _Polypora dendroides_, of the natural size, Ireland; a' Small\r\nportion of the same, enlarged to show the cells; b, Glauconome\r\npulcherrima_, a fragment, of the natural size, Ireland; b',\r\nPortion of the same, enlarged; c, The central screw-like axis\r\nof _Archimedes Wortheni_, of the natural size--Carboniferous,\r\nAmerica; c', Portion of the exterior of the frond of the same,\r\nenlarged; c'', Portion of the interior of the frond of the\r\nsame showing the mouths of the cells, enlarged. (After M'Coy and\r\nHall.)]\r\n\r\nThe lower groups of the _Mollusca_ are abundantly represented\r\nin the marine strata of the Carboniferous series by _Polyzoans_\r\nand _Brachiopods_. Amongst the former, although a variety of other\r\ntypes are known, the majority still belong to the old group of\r\nthe \"Lace-corals\" (_Fenestellidoe_), some of the characteristic\r\nforms of which are here figured (fig. 126). The graceful netted\r\nfronds of _Fenestella, Retepora_, and _Polypora_ (fig. 126, a)\r\nare highly characteristic, as are the slender toothed branches\r\nof _Glauconome_ (fig. 126, b). A more singular form, however,\r\nis the curious _Archimedes_ (fig. 126, c), which is so\r\ncharacteristic of the Carboniferous formation of North America.\r\nIn this remarkable type, the colony consists of a succession of\r\nfunnel-shaped fronds, essentially similar to _Fenestella_ in\r\ntheir structure, springing in a continuous spiral from a strong\r\nscrew-like vertical axis. The outside of the fronds is simply\r\nstriated; but the branches exhibit on the interior the mouths of\r\nthe little cells in which the semi-independent beings composing\r\nthe colony originally lived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127.--Carboniferous _Braciopoda. a, _Producta\r\nsemireticulata_, showing the slightly concave dorsal valve; a'\r\nSide view of the same, showing the convex ventral valve; b,\r\n_Producta longispina_; c, _Orthis resupinata_; d, _Terebratula\r\nhastata_; e, _Athyris subtilita_; f, _Chonetes Hardrensis_; g,\r\n_Rhynchonella pleurodon_; h, _Spirifera trigonalis_. Most of\r\nthese forms are widely distributed in the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nof Britain, Europe, America, &c. All the figures are of the natural\r\nsize. (After Davidson, De Koninck, and Meek.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Brachiopods_ are extremely abundant, and for the most part\r\nbelong to types which are exclusively or principally Palæozoic\r\nin their range. The old genera _Strophomena, Orthis_ (fig. 127,\r\nc), _Athyris_ (fig. 127, e), _Rhynchonella_ (fig. 127, g),\r\nand _Spirifera_ (fig. 127, h), are still well represented--the\r\nlatter, in particular, existing under numerous specific forms,\r\nconspicuous by their abundance and sometimes by their size. Along\r\nwith these ancient groups, we have representatives--for the first\r\ntime in any plenty--of the great genus _Terebratula_ (fig. 127,\r\nd), which underwent a great expansion during later periods,\r\nand still exists at the present day. The most characteristic\r\nCarboniferous Brachiopods, however, belong to the family of the\r\n_Productidoe_, of which the principal genus is _Producta_ itself.\r\nThis family commenced its existence in the Upper Silurian with\r\nthe genus _Chonetes_, distinguished by its spinose hinge-margin.\r\nThis genus lived through the Devonian, and flourished in the\r\nCarboniferous (fig. 127, f). The genus _Producta_ itself,\r\nrepresented in the Devonian by the nearly allied _Productella_,\r\nappeared first in the Carboniferous, at any rate, in force, and\r\nsurvived into the Permian; but no member of this extensive family\r\nhas yet been shown to have over-lived the Palæozoic period. The\r\n_Productoe_ of the Carboniferous are not only exceedingly abundant,\r\nbut they have in many instances a most extensive geographical range,\r\nand some species attain what may fairly be considered-gigantic\r\ndimensions. The shell (fig. 127, a and b) is generally more\r\nor less semicircular, with a straight hinge-margin, and having\r\nits lateral angles produced into larger or smaller ears (hence\r\nits generic name--\"_cochlea producta_\"). One valve (the ventral)\r\nis usually strongly convex, whilst the other (the dorsal) is flat\r\nor concave, the surface of both being adorned with radiating\r\nribs, and with hollow tubular spines, often of great length.\r\nThe valves are not locked together by teeth, and there is no\r\nsign in the fully-grown shell of an opening in or between the\r\nvalves for the emission of a muscular stalk for the attachment\r\nof the shell to foreign objects. It is probable, therefore, that\r\nthe _Productoe_, unlike the ordinary Lamp-shells, lived an\r\nindependent existence, their long spines apparently serving to\r\nanchor them firmly in the mud or ooze of the sea-bottom; but Mr\r\nRobert Etheridge, jun.; has recently shown that in one species\r\nthe spines were actually employed as organs of adhesion, whereby\r\nthe shell was permanently attached to some extraneous object,\r\nsuch as the stem of a Crinoid. The two species here figured are\r\ninteresting for their extraordinarily extensive geographical\r\nrange--_Producta semireticulata_ (fig. 127, a) being found\r\nin the Carboniferous rocks of Britain, the continent of Europe,\r\nCentral Asia, China, India, Australia, Spitzbergen, and North\r\nand South America; whilst _P. Longispina_ (fig. 127, b) has\r\na distribution little if at all less wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128.--_Pupa (Dendropupa) vetusta_, a\r\nCarboniferous Land-snail from the Coal-measures of Nova Scotia.\r\na, The shell, of the natural size; b, The same, magnified;\r\nc, Apex of the shell, enlarged; d, Portion of the surface,\r\nenlarged. (After Dawson.)]\r\n\r\nThe higher _Mollusca_ are abundantly represented in the Carboniferous\r\nrocks by Bivalves (_Lamellibranchs_), Univalves (_Gasteropoda_),\r\nWinged-snails (_Pteropoda_), and _Cephalopods_. Amongst the Bivalves\r\nwe may note the great abundance of Scallops (_Aviculopecten_ and\r\nother allied forms), together with numerous other types--some of\r\nancient origin, others represented here for the first time. Amongst\r\nthe Gasteropods, we find the characteristically Palæozoic genera\r\n_Macrocheilus_ and _Loxonema_, the almost exclusively Palæozoic\r\n_Euomphalus_, and the persistent, genus _Pleurotomaria_; whilst\r\nthe free-swimming Univalves (_Heteropoda_)are represented by\r\n_Bellerophon_ and _Porcellia_, and the _Pteropoda_ by the old\r\ngenus _Conularia_. With regard to the Carboniferous Univalves,\r\nit is also of interest to note here the first appearance of true\r\nair-breathing or terrestrial Molluscs, as discovered by Dawson\r\nand Bradley in the Coal-measures of Nova Scotia and Illinois. Some\r\nof these (_Conulus priscus_) are true Land-snails, resembling the\r\nexisting _Zonites_; whilst others (_Pupa vetusta_, fig. 128) appear\r\nto be generically inseparable from the \"Chrysalis-shells\" (_Pupa_)\r\nof the present day. All the known forms--three in number--are of\r\nsmall size, and appear to have been local in their distribution\r\nor in their preservation. More important, however, than any of\r\nthe preceding, are the _Cephalopoda_, represented, as before,\r\nexclusively by the chambered shells of the Tetrabranchiates.\r\nThe older and simpler type of these, with simple plain septa,\r\nand mostly a central siphuncle, is represented by the straight\r\nconical shells of the ancient genus Orthoceras, and the bow-shaped\r\nshells of the equally ancient _Cyrtoceras_--some of the former\r\nattaining a great size. The spirally-curved discoidal shells\r\nof the persistent genus _Nautilus_ are also not unknown, and\r\nsome of these likewise exhibit very considerable dimensions.\r\nLastly, the more complex family of the _Ammonitidoe_, with lobed\r\nor angulated septa, and a dorsally-placed siphuncle (situated on\r\nthe convex side of the curved shells), now for the first time\r\ncommences to acquire a considerable prominence. The principal\r\nrepresentative of this group is the genus _Goniatites_ (fig.\r\n129), which commenced its existence in the Upper Silurian, is well\r\nrepresented in the Devonian, and attains its maximum here. In this\r\ngenus, the shell is spirally curved, the septa are strongly lobed\r\nor angulated, though not elaborately frilled as in the Ammonites,\r\nand the siphuncle is dorsal. In addition to _Goniatites_, the\r\nshells of true _Ammonites_, so characteristic of the Secondary\r\nperiod, have been described by Dr Waagen as occurring in the\r\nCarboniferous rocks of India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129.--_Goniatites (Aganides) Fossoe_.\r\nCarboniferous Limestone.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130.--_Amblypterus macropterus_. Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\nComing finally to the _Vertebrata_, we have in the first place\r\nto very briefly consider the Carboniferous _fishes_. These are\r\nnumerous; but, with the exception of the still dubious \"Conodonts,\"\r\nbelong wholly to the groups of the _Ganoids_ and the _Placoids_\r\n(including under the former head remains which perhaps are truly\r\nreferable to the group of the _Dipnoi_ or Mud-fishes). Amongst the\r\n_Ganoids_, the singular buckler-headed fishes of the Upper Silurian\r\nand Devonian (_Cephalaspidoe_) have apparently disappeared; and\r\nthe principal types of the Carboniferous belong to the groups\r\nrespectively represented at the present day by the Gar pike\r\n(_Lepidosteus_) of the North American lakes, and the _Polypterus_\r\nof the rivers of Africa. Of the former, the genera _Paloeoniscus_\r\nand _Amblypterus_ (fig. 130), with their small rhomboidal and\r\nenamelled scales, and their strongly unsymmetrical tails, are\r\nperhaps the most abundant. Of the latter, the most important are\r\nspecies belonging to the genera _Megalichthys_ and _Rhizodus_,\r\ncomprising large fishes, with rhomboidal scales, unsymmetrical\r\n(\"heterocercal\") tails, and powerful conical teeth. These fishes\r\nare sometimes said to be \"sauroid,\" from their presenting some\r\nReptilian features in their organisation, and they must have been\r\nthe scourges of the Carboniferous seas. The remains of _Placoid_\r\nfishes in the Carboniferous strata are very numerous, but consist\r\nwholly of teeth and fin-spines, referable to forms more or less\r\nclosely allied to our existing Port Jackson Sharks, Dog-fishes,\r\nand Rays. The teeth are of very various shapes and sizes,--some\r\nwith sharp, cutting edges (_Petalodus, Cladodus_, &c.); others in\r\nthe form of broad crushing plates, adapted, like the teeth of the\r\nexisting Port Jackson Shark (_Cestracion Philippi_), for breaking\r\ndown the hard shells of Molluscs and Crustaceans. Amongst the many\r\nkinds of these latter, the teeth of _Psammodus_ and _Cochliodus_\r\n(fig. 131) may be mentioned as specially characteristic. The\r\nfin-spines are mostly similar to those so common in the Devonian\r\ndeposits, consisting of hollow defensive spines implanted in\r\nfront of the pectoral or other fins, usually slightly curved,\r\noften superficially ribbed or sculptured, and not uncommonly\r\nserrated or toothed. The genera _Ctenacanthus, Gyracanthus,\r\nHomacanthus_, &c., have been founded for the reception of these\r\ndefensive weapons, some of which indicate fishes of great size\r\nand predaceous habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131.--Teeth of _Cochliodus contortus_.\r\nCarboniferous Limestone, Britain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132.--a, Upper surface of the skull of\r\n_Anthracosaurus Russelli_, one-sixth of the natural size: b,\r\nPart of one of the teeth cut across, and highly magnified to\r\nshow the characteristic labyrinthine structure; c, One of the\r\nintegumentary shields or scales, one-half of the natural size.\r\nCoal-measures, Northumberland. (After Atthey.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Devonian rocks we meet with no other remains of\r\nVertebrated animals save fishes only; but the Carboniferous\r\ndeposits have yielded remains of the higher group\r\nof the _Amphibians_. This class, comprising our existing\r\nFrogs, Toads, and Newts, stands to some extent in a position midway\r\nbetween the class of the fishes and that of the true\r\nreptiles, being distinguished from the latter by the fact\r\nthat its members invariably  possess gills in their early\r\ncondition, if not throughout life; whilst they are separated from\r\nthe former by always possessing true lungs when adult, and\r\nby the fact that the limbs (when present at all) are never in\r\nthe form of fins. The Amphibians, therefore, are all\r\nwater-breathers when young, and have respiratory organs adapted\r\nfor an aquatic mode of life; whereas, when grown up, they\r\ndevelop lungs, and with these the capacity for breathing air\r\ndirectly. Some of them, like the Frogs and Newts, lose their\r\ngills altogether on attaining the adult condition; but others,\r\nsuch as the living _Proteus_ and _Menobranchus_, retain\r\ntheir gills even after acquiring their lungs, and are thus fitted\r\nindifferently for an aquatic or terrestrial existence. The name of\r\n\"Amphibia,\" though applied to the whole class, is thus not\r\nprecisely appropriate except to these last-mentioned forms\r\n(Gr. _amphi_, both; _bios_, life). The Amphibians also\r\ndiffer amongst themselves according as to whether they keep\r\npermanently the long tail which they all possess when young (as\r\ndo the Newts and Salamanders), or lose this appendage when\r\ngrown up (as do the Frogs and Toads). Most of them have\r\nnaked skins, but a few living and many extinct forms have\r\nhard structures in the shape of scales developed in the integument.\r\nAll of them have well-ossified skeletons, though some\r\nfossil types are partially deficient in this respect; and all of\r\nthem which possess limbs at all have these appendages supported\r\nby bones essentially similar to those found in the limbs\r\nof the higher Vertebrates. All the Carboniferous Amphibians\r\nbelong to a group which has now wholly passed away--namely,\r\nthat of the _Labyrinthodonts_. In the marine strata which\r\nform the base of the Carboniferous series these creatures have only\r\nbeen recognised by their curious hand-shaped footprints, similar\r\nin character to those which occur in the Triassic rocks, and which\r\nwill be subsequently spoken of under the name of _Cheirotherium_.\r\nIn the Coal-measures of Britain, the continent of Europe, and\r\nNorth America, however, many bones of these animals have\r\nbeen found, and we are now tolerably well acquainted with a\r\nconsiderable number of forms. All of them seem to have\r\nbelonged to the division of Amphibians in which the long tail\r\nof the young is permanently retained; and there is evidence\r\nthat some of them kept the gills also throughout life. The skull\r\nis of the characteristic Amphibian type (fig. 132, a), with\r\ntwo occipital condyles, and having its surface singularly pitted\r\nand sculptured; and the vertebræ are hollowed out at both\r\nends. The lower surface of the body was defended by an armour\r\nof singular integumentary shields or scales (fig. 132, c);\r\nand an extremely characteristic feature (from which the entire\r\ngroup derives its name) is, that the walls of the teeth are deeply\r\nfolded, so as to give rise to an extraordinary \"labyrinthine\"\r\npattern when they are cut across (fig. 132, b). Many of the\r\nCarboniferous Labyrinthodonts are of no great size, some of\r\nthem very small, but others attain comparatively gigantic\r\ndimensions, though all fall short in this respect of the huge\r\nexamples of this group which occur in the Trias. One of the\r\nlargest, and at the same time most characteristic, forms of the\r\nCarboniferous series, is the genus _Anthracosaurus_, the\r\nskull of which is here figured.\r\n\r\nNo remains of true Reptiles, Birds, or Quadrupeds have as yet\r\nbeen certainly detected in the Carboniferous deposits in any part\r\nof the world. It should, however, be mentioned, that Professor\r\nMarsh, one of the highest authorities on the subject, has described\r\nfrom the Coal-formation of Nova Scotia certain vertebræ which\r\nhe believes to have belonged to a marine reptile (_Eosaurus\r\nAcadianus_), allied to the great _Ichthyosauri_ of the Lias. Up to\r\nthis time no confirmation of this determination has been obtained\r\nby the discovery of other and more unquestionable remains, and\r\nit therefore remains doubtful whether these bones of _Eosaurus_\r\nmay not really belong to large Labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains some of the more important of the\r\noriginal sources of information to which the student of Carboniferous\r\nrocks and fossils may refer:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Geology of Yorkshire,' vol. ii.; 'The Mountain Limestone\r\n     District.'

Consisting, as\r\nit does, largely of red rocks--sandstones and marls--for the\r\nmost part singularly destitute of organic remains, the Permian\r\nrocks have been regarded as a lacustrine or fluviatile deposit;\r\nbut the presence of well-developed limestones with indubitable\r\nmarine remains entirely negatives this view. It is, however,\r\nnot improbable that we are presented in the Permian formation,\r\nas known to us at present, with a series of sediments laid down\r\nin inland seas of great extent, due to the subsidence over large\r\nareas of the vast land-surfaces of the Coal-measures. This view,\r\nat any rate, would explain some of the more puzzling physical\r\ncharacters of the formation, and would not be definitely negatived\r\nby any of its fossils.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the Permian series, as already remarked, consists\r\nof sandstones and marls, deeply reddened by peroxide of iron, and\r\noften accompanied by beds of gypsum or deposits of salt. In strata\r\nof this nature few or no fossils are found; but their shallow-water\r\norigin is sufficiently proved by the presence of the footprints\r\nof terrestrial animals, accompanied in some cases by well-defined\r\n\"ripple-marks.\" Along with these are occasionally found massive\r\nbreccias, holding larger or smaller blocks derived from the older\r\nformations; and these have been supposed to represent an old\r\n\"boulder-clay,\" and thus to indicate the prevalence of an arctic\r\nclimate. Beds of this nature must also have been deposited in\r\nshallow water. In all regions, however, where the Permian formation\r\nis well developed, one of its most characteristic members is a\r\nMagnesian limestone, often highly and fantastically concretionary,\r\nbut containing numerous remains of genuine marine animals, and\r\nclearly indicating that it was deposited beneath a moderate depth\r\nof salt water.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to consider here whether this formation can\r\nbe retained as a distinct division of the geological series. The\r\nname of _Permian_ was given to it by Sir Roderick Murchison,\r\nfrom the province of Perm in Russia, where rocks of this age are\r\nextensively developed. Formerly these rocks were grouped with\r\nthe succeeding formation of the Trias under the common name of\r\n\"New Red Sandstone.\" This name was given them because they contain\r\na good deal of red sandstone, and because they are superior to the\r\nCarboniferous rocks, while the Old Red Sandstone is inferior.\r\nNowadays, however, the term \"New Red Sandstone\" is rarely employed,\r\nunless it be for red sandstones and associated rocks, which are\r\nseen to overlie the Coal-measures, but which contain no fossils by\r\nwhich their exact age may be made out. Under these circumstances,\r\nit is sometimes convenient to employ the term \"New Red Sandstone.\"\r\nThe New Red, however, of the older geologists, is now broken up\r\ninto the two formations of the Permian and Triassic rocks--the\r\nformer being usually considered as the top of the Palæozoic series,\r\nand the latter constituting the base of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, the Permian rocks are seen to repose unconformably\r\nupon the underlying Carboniferous, from which they can in addition\r\nbe readily separated by their lithological characters. In other\r\ninstances, however, the Coal-measures terminate upwards in red\r\nrocks, not distinguishable by their mineral characters from the\r\nPermian; and in other cases no physical discordance between the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian strata can be detected. As a general\r\nrule, also, the Permian rocks appear to pass upwards conformably\r\ninto the Trias. The division, therefore, between the Permian\r\nand Triassic rocks, and consequently between the Palæozoic and\r\nMesozoic series, is not founded upon any conspicuous or universal\r\nphysical break, but upon the difference in life which is observed\r\nin comparing the marine animals of the Carboniferous and Permian\r\nwith those of the Trias. It is to be observed, however, that\r\nthis difference can be solely due to the fact that the Magnesian\r\nLimestone of the Permian series presents us with only a small,\r\nand not a typical, portion of the marine deposits which must have\r\nbeen accumulated in some area at present unknown to us during the\r\nperiod which elapsed between the formation of the great marine\r\nlimestones of the Lower Carboniferous and the open-sea and likewise\r\ncalcareous sediments of the Middle Trias.\r\n\r\nThe Permian rocks exhibit their most typical features in Russia\r\nand Germany, though they are very well developed in parts of\r\nBritain, and they occur in North America. When well developed,\r\nthey exhibit three main divisions: a lower set of sandstones,\r\na middle group, generally calcareous, and an upper series of\r\nsandstones, constituting respectively the Lower, Middle, and Upper\r\nPermians.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, Germany, and Britain, the Permian rocks consist of\r\nthe following members:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Lower Permians_, consisting mainly of a great series\r\nof sandstones, of different colours, but usually red. The base\r\nof this series is often constituted by massive breccias with\r\nincluded fragments of the older rocks, upon which they may happen\r\nto repose; and similar breccias sometimes occur in the upper\r\nportion of the series as well. The thickness of this group varies\r\na good deal, but may amount to 3000 or 4000 feet.\r\n\r\n2. The _Middle Permians_, consisting, in their typical development,\r\nof laminated marls, or \"marl-slate,\" surmounted by beds of magnesian\r\nlimestone (the \"Zechstein\" of the German geologists). Sometimes\r\nthe limestones are degenerate or wholly deficient, and the series\r\nmay consist of sandy shales and gypsiferous clays. The magnesian\r\nlimestone, however, of the Middle Permians is, as a rule, so well\r\nmarked a feature that it was long spoken of as _the_ Magnesian\r\nLimestone.\r\n\r\n3. The _Upper Permians_, consisting of a series of sandstones\r\nand shales, or of red or mottled marls, often gypsiferous, and\r\nsometimes including beds of limestone.\r\n\r\nIn North America, the Permian rocks appear to be confined to the\r\nregion west of the Mississippi, being especially well developed\r\nin Kansas. Their exact limits have not as yet been made out,\r\nand their total thickness is not more than a few hundred feet.\r\nThey consist of sandstones, conglomerates, limestones, marls,\r\nand beds of gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe following diagrammatic section shows the general sequence of\r\nthe Permian deposits in the north of England, where the series\r\nis extensively developed (fig. 133):--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. GENERALISED SECTION OF THE PERMIAN ROCKS\r\nIN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe record of the _life_ of the Permian period is but a scanty\r\none, owing doubtless to the special peculiarities of such of the\r\ndeposits of this age with which we are as yet acquainted. Red rocks\r\nare, as a general rule, more or less completely unfossiliferous, and\r\nsediments of this nature are highly characteristic of the Permian.\r\nSimilarly, magnesian limestones are rarely as highly charged with\r\norganic remains as is the case with normal calcareous deposits,\r\nespecially when they have been subjected to concretionary action,\r\nas is observable to such a marked extent in the Permian limestones.\r\nNevertheless, much interest is attached to the organic remains,\r\nas marking a kind of transition-period between the Palæozoic\r\nand Mesozoic epochs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134.--_Walchia piniformis_, from the Permian\r\nof Saxony, a, Branch; b, Twig, (After Gutbier.)]\r\n\r\nThe _plants_ of the Permian period, as a whole, have a distinctly\r\nPalæozoic aspect, and are far more nearly allied to those of the\r\nCoal-measures than they are to those of the earlier Secondary\r\nrocks; though the Permian _species_ are mostly distinct from\r\nthe Carboniferous, and there are some new genera. Thus, we find\r\nspecies of _Lepidodendron, Calamites, Equisetites, Asterophyllites,\r\nAnnularia_, and other highly characteristic Carboniferous genera.\r\nOn the other hand, the _Sigillariods_ of the Coal seem to have\r\nfinally disappeared at the close of the Carboniferous period. Ferns\r\nare abundant in the Permian rocks, and belong for the most part to\r\nthe well-known Carboniferous genera _Alethopteris, Neuropteris,\r\nSphenopteris_, and _Pecopteris_. There are also Tree-ferns referable\r\nto the ancient genus _Psaronius_. The _Conifers_ of the Permian\r\nperiod are numerous, and belong in part to Carboniferous genera.\r\nA characteristic genus, however, is _Walchia_ (fig. 134),\r\ndistinguished by its lax short leaves. This genus, though not\r\nexclusively Permian, is mainly so, the best-known species being\r\nthe _W. Piniformis_. Here, also, we meet with Conifers which\r\nproduce true cones, and which differ, therefore, in an important\r\ndegree from the Taxoid Conifers of the Coal-measures. Besides\r\n_Walchia_, a characteristic form of these is the _Ullmania\r\nselaginoides_, which occurs in the Magnesian Limestone of Durham,\r\nthe Middle Permian of Westmorland, and the \"Kupfer-schiefer\" of\r\nGermany. The group of the _Cycads_, which we shall subsequently\r\nfind to be so characteristic of the vegetation of the Secondary\r\nperiod, is, on the other hand, only doubtfully represented in\r\nthe Permian deposits by the singular genus _Noeggerathia_.\r\n\r\nThe _Protozoans_ of the Permian rocks are few in number, and\r\nfor the most part imperfectly known. A few _Foraminifera_ have\r\nbeen obtained from the Magnesian Limestone of England, and the\r\nsame formation has yielded some ill-understood Sponges. It does\r\nnot seem, however, altogether impossible that some of the singular\r\n\"concretions\" of this formation may ultimately prove to have an\r\norganic structure, though others would appear to be clearly of\r\npurely inorganic origin. From the Permian of Saxony, Professor\r\nGeinitz has described two species of _Spongillopsis_, which he\r\nbelieves to be most nearly allied to the existing fresh-water\r\nSponges (_Spongilla_). This observation has an interest as bearing\r\nupon the mode of deposition and origin of the Permian sediments.\r\n\r\nThe _Coelenterates_ are represented in the Permian by but a few\r\nCorals. These belong partly to the _Tabulate_ and partly to the\r\n_Rugose_ division; but the latter great group, so abundantly\r\nrepresented in Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous seas, is\r\nnow extraordinarily reduced in numbers, the British strata of\r\nthis age yielding only species of the single genus _Polycoelia_.\r\nSo far, therefore, as at present known, all the characteristic\r\ngenera of the Rugose Corals of the Carboniferous had become extinct\r\nbefore the deposition of the limestones of the Middle Permian.\r\n\r\nThe _Echinoderms_ are represented by a few _Crinoids_, and by a\r\nSea-urchin belonging to the genus _Eocidaris_. The latter genus\r\nis nearly allied to the _Archoeocidaris_ of the Carboniferous, so\r\nthat this Permian form belongs to a characteristically Palæozoic\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nA few _Annelides_ (_Spirorbis, Vermilia_, &c.) have been described,\r\nbut are of no special importance. Amongst the _Crustaceans_,\r\nhowever, we have to note the total absence of the great Palæozoic\r\ngroup of the _Trilobites_; whilst the little _Ostracoda_ and\r\n_Phyllopods_ still continue to be represented. We have also to\r\nnote the first appearance here of the \"Short-tailed\" Decapods or\r\nCrabs (_Brachyura_), the highest of all the groups of _Crustacea_,\r\nin the person of _Hemitrochiscus paradoxus_, an extremely minute\r\nCrab from the Permian of Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135.--Brachiopods of the Permian formation.\r\na, _Producta horrida_; b, _Lingula Credneri_; c, _Terebratula\r\nelongata_; d and e, _Camarophoria globulina_. (After King.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Mollusca_, the remains of _Polyzoa_ may fairly be\r\nsaid to be amongst the most abundant of all the fossils of the\r\nPermian formation, The principal forms of these are the fronds\r\nof the Lace-corals (_Fenestella, Retepora_, and _Synocladia_),\r\nwhich are very abundant in the Magnesian Limestone of the north\r\nof England, and belong to various highly characteristic species\r\n(such as _Fenestella retiformis, Retepora Ehrenbergi_, and\r\n_Synocladia virgulacea_). The _Brachiopoda_ are also represented\r\nin moderate numbers in the Permian. Along with species of the\r\npersistent genera _Discina, Crania_, and _Lingula_, we still\r\nmeet with representatives of the old groups _Spirifera, Athyris_,\r\nand _Streptorhynchus_; and the Carboniferous _Productoe_ yet\r\nsurvive under well-marked and characteristic types, though in\r\nmuch-diminished numbers. The species of Brachiopods here figured\r\n(fig. 135) are characteristic of the Magnesian Limestone in Britain\r\nand of the corresponding strata on the Continent. Upon the whole,\r\nthe most characteristic Permian _Brachiopods_ belong to the genera\r\n_Producta, Strophalosia_, and _Camarophoria_.\r\n\r\nThe _Bivalves_ (_Lamellibranchiata_) have a tolerably varied\r\ndevelopment in the Permian rocks; but nearly all the old types,\r\nexcept some of those which occur in the Carboniferous, have now\r\ndisappeared. The principal Permian Bivalves belong to the groups\r\nof the Pearl Oysters (_Aviculidoe_) and the _Trigoniadoe_,\r\nrepresented by genera such as _Bakewellia_ and _Schizodus_; the\r\ntrue Mussels (_Mytilidoe_), represented by species which have\r\nbeen referred to _Mytilus_ itself; and the Arks (_Arcadoe_),\r\nrepresented by species of the genera _Arca_ (fig. 136) and\r\n_Byssoarca_. The first and last of these three families have a\r\nvery ancient origin; but the family of the _Trigoniadoe_, though\r\nfeebly represented at the present day, is one which attained\r\nits maximum development in the Mesozoic period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136.--_Arca antiqua_. Permian.]\r\n\r\nThe _Univalves_ (_Gasteropoda_) are rare, and do not demand special\r\nnotice. It may be observed, however, that the Palæozoic genera\r\n_Euomphalus, Murchisonia, Loxonema_, and _Macrocheilus_ are still\r\nin existence, together with the persistent genus _Pleurotomaria_.\r\n_Pteropods_ of the old genera _Theca_ and _Conularia_ have been\r\ndiscovered; but the first of these characteristically Palæozoic\r\ntypes finally dies out here, and the second only survives but a\r\nshort time longer. Lastly, a few _Cephalopods_ have been found,\r\nstill wholly referable to the Tetrabranchiate group, and belonging\r\nto the old genera _Orthoceras_ and _Cyrtoceras_ and the long-lived\r\n_Nautilus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137.--_Platysomus gibbosus_, a \"heterocercal\"\r\nGanoid, from the Middle Permian of Russia.]\r\n\r\nAmongst _Vertebrates_, we meet in the Permian period not only\r\nwith the remains of Fishes and Amphibians, but also, for the\r\nfirst time, with true Reptiles. The _Fishes_ are mainly _Ganoids_,\r\nthough there are also remains of a few Cestraciont Sharks. Not\r\nonly are the _Ganoids_ still the predominant group of Fishes, but\r\nall the known forms possess the unsymmetrical (\"heterocercal\")\r\ntail which is so characteristic of the Palæozoic Ganoids. Most\r\nof the remains of the Permian Fishes have been obtained from the\r\n\"Marl-slate\" of Durham and the corresponding \"Kupfer-schiefer\" of\r\nGermany, on the horizon of the Middle Permian; and the principal\r\ngenera of the Ganoids are _Paloeoniscus_ and _Platysomus_ (fig.\r\n137).\r\n\r\nThe _Amphibians_ of the Permian period belong principally to the\r\norder of the _Labyrinthodonts_, which commenced to be represented\r\nin the Carboniferous, and has a large development in the Trias.\r\nUnder the name, however, of _Paloeosiren Beinerti_, Professor\r\nGeinitz has described an Amphibian from the Lower Permian of\r\nGermany, which he believes to be most nearly allied to the existing\r\n\"Mud-eel\" (_Siren lacertina_) of North America, and therefore\r\nto be related to the Newts and Salamanders (_Urodela_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138.--_Protorosaurus Speneri_, Middle Permian,\r\nThuringia, reduced in size. (After Von Meyer.) [Copied from Dana.]]\r\n\r\nFinally, we meet in the Permian deposits with the first undoubted\r\nremains of true _Reptiles_. These are distinguished, as a class,\r\nfrom the _Amphibians_, by the fact that they are air-breathers\r\nthroughout the whole of their life, and therefore are at no time\r\nprovided with gills; whilst they are exempt from that metamorphosis\r\nwhich all the _Amphibia_ undergo in early life, consequent upon\r\ntheir transition from an aquatic to a more or less purely aerial\r\nmode of respiration. Their skeleton is well ossified; they usually\r\nhave horny or bony plates, singly or in combination, developed\r\nin the skin; and their limbs (when present) are never either\r\nin the form of _fins_ or _wings_, though sometimes capable of\r\nacting in either of these capacities, and liable to great\r\nmodifications of form and structure. Though there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever as to the occurrence of genuine Reptiles in deposits of\r\nunquestionable Permian age, there is still uncertainty as to the\r\nprecise number of types which may have existed at this period.\r\nThis uncertainty arises partly from the difficulty of deciding\r\nin all cases, whether a given bone be truely Labyrinthodont or\r\nReptilian, but more especially from the confusion which exists at\r\npresent between the Permian and the overlying Triassic deposits.\r\nThus there are various deposits in different regions which have\r\nyielded the remains of Reptiles, and which cannot in the meanwhile\r\nbe definitely referred either to the Permian series or to the\r\nTrias by clear stratigraphical or palæontological evidence. All\r\nthat can be done in such cases is to be guided by the characters\r\nof the Reptiles themselves, and to judge by their affinities to\r\nremains from known Triassic or Permian rocks to which of these\r\nformations the beds containing them should be referred; but it\r\nis obvious that this method of procedure is seriously liable\r\nto lead to error. In accordance, however, with this, the only\r\navailable mode of determination in some cases, the remains of\r\n_Thecodontosaurus_ and _Palæosaurus_ discovered in the dolomitic\r\nconglomerates near Bristol will be considered as Triassic, thus\r\nleaving _Protorosaurus_[20] as the principal and most important\r\nrepresentative of the Permian Reptiles.[21] The type-species of\r\nthe genus _Protorusaurus_ is the _P. Speneri_(fig. 138) of the\r\n\"Kupfer-schiefer\" of Thuringia, but other allied species have\r\nbeen detected in the Middle Permian of Germany and the north\r\nof England. This Reptile attained a length of from three to four\r\nfeet; and it has been generally referred to the group of the\r\nLizards (_Lacertilia_), to which it is most nearly allied in\r\nits general structure, at the same time that it differs from\r\nall existing members of this group in the fact that its numerous\r\nconical and pointed teeth were implanted in distinct sockets in\r\nthe jaws--this being a Crocodilian character. In other respects,\r\nhowever, _Protorosaurus_ approximates closely to the living Monitors\r\n(_Varanidoe_); and the fact that the bodies of the vertebræ are\r\nslightly cupped or hollowed out at the ends would lead to the\r\nbelief that the animal was aquatic in its habits. At the same\r\ntime, the structure of the hind-limbs and their bony supports\r\nproves clearly that it must have also possessed the power of\r\nprogression upon the land. Various other Reptilian bones have\r\nbeen described from the Permian formation, of which some are\r\nprobably really referable to Labyrinthodonts, whilst others are\r\nregarded by Professor Owen as referable to the order of the\r\n\"Theriodonts,\" in which the teeth are implanted in sockets, and\r\nresemble those of carnivorous quadrupeds in consisting of three\r\ngroups in each jaw (namely, incisors, canines, and molars). Lastly,\r\nin red sandstones of Permian age in Dumfriesshire have been\r\ndiscovered the tracks of what would appear to have been _Chelonians_\r\n(Tortoises and Turtles); but it would not be safe to accept this\r\nconclusion as certain upon the evidence of footprints alone. The\r\n_Chelichnus Duncani_, however, described by Sir William Jardine\r\nin his magnificent work on the 'Ichnology of Annandale,' bears\r\na great resemblance to the track of a Turtle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Though commonly spelt as above, it is probable\r\nthat the name of this Lizard was really intended to have been\r\n_Proterosaurus_--from the Greek _proteros_, first; and _saura_,\r\nlizard: and this spelling is followed by many writers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: In an extremely able paper upon the subject (Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc., vol. xxvi.), Mr Etheridge has shown that there\r\nare good physical grounds for regarding the dolomitie conglomerate\r\nof Bristol as of Triassic age, and as probably corresponding in\r\ntime with the Muschelkalk of the Continent.]\r\n\r\nNo remains of Birds or Quadrupeds have hitherto been detected\r\nin deposits of Permian age.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following works may be consulted by the student with regard\r\nto the Permian formation and its fossils:--\r\n\r\n (1) \"On the Geological Relations and Internal Structure of the\r\n     Magnesian Limestone and the Lower Portions of the New Red\r\n     Sandstone Series, &c.\"--'Trans.

Ramsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIASSIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of the great _Mesozoic_, or\r\nSecondary series of formations, consisting, in ascending order,\r\nof the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous systems. The Triassic\r\ngroup forms the base of the Mesozoic series, and corresponds\r\nwith the higher portion of the New Red Sandstone of the older\r\ngeologists. Like the Permian rocks, and as implied by its name,\r\nthe _Trias_ admits of a subdivision into three groups--a Lower,\r\nMiddle, and Upper Trias. Of these sub-divisions the middle one\r\nis wanting in Britain; and all have received German names, being\r\nmore largely and typically developed in Germany than in any other\r\ncountry. Thus, the Lower Trias is known as the _Bunter Sandstein_;\r\nthe Middle Trias is called the _Muschelkalk_; and the Upper Trias\r\nis known as the _Keuper_.\r\n\r\nI. The lowest division of the Trias is known as the _Bunter\r\nSandstein_ (the _Grès bigarré_ of the French), from the generally\r\nvariegated colours of the beds which compose it (German, _bunt_,\r\nvariegated). The Bunter Sandstein of the continent of Europe\r\nconsists of red and white sandstones, with red clays, and thin\r\nlimestones, the whole attaining a thickness of about 1500 feet.\r\nThe term \"marl\" is very generally employed to designate the clays\r\nof the Lower and Upper Trias; but the term is inappropriate, as\r\nthey may contain no lime, and are therefore not always genuine\r\nmarls. In Britain the Bunter Sandstein consists of red and mottled\r\nsandstones, with unconsolidated conglomerates, or \"pebble-beds,\"\r\nthe whole having a thickness of 1000 to 2000 feet. The Bunter\r\nSandstein, as a rule, is very barren of fossils.\r\n\r\nII. The Middle Trias is not developed in Britain, but it is largely\r\ndeveloped in Germany, where it constitutes what is known as the\r\n_Muschelkalk_ (Germ. _Muschel_, mussel; _kalk_, limestone), from\r\nthe abundance of fossil shells which it contains. The Muschelkalk\r\n(the _Calcaire coquillier_ of the French) consists of compact\r\ngrey or yellowish limestones, sometimes dolomitic, and including\r\noccasional beds of gypsum and rock-salt.\r\n\r\nIII. The Upper Trias, or _Keuper_ (the _Marnes irisées_ of the\r\nFrench), as it is generally called, occurs in England; but is\r\nnot so well developed as it is in Germany. In Britain, the Keuper\r\nis 1000 feet or more in thickness, and consists of white and\r\nbrown sandstones, with red marls, the whole topped by red clays\r\nwith rock-salt and gypsum.\r\n\r\nThe Keuper in Britain is extremely unfossiliferous; but it passes\r\nupwards with perfect conformity into a very remarkable group of\r\nbeds, at one time classed with the Lias, and now known under the\r\nnames of the Penarth beds (from Penarth, in Glamorganshire), the\r\nRhætic beds (from the Rhætic Alps), or the _Avicula contorta_ beds\r\n(from the occurrence in them of great numbers of this peculiar\r\nBivalve). These singular beds have been variously regarded as the\r\nhighest beds of the Trias, or the lowest beds of the Lias, or as\r\nan intermediate group. The phenomena observed on the Continent,\r\nhowever, render it best to consider them as Triassic, as they\r\ncertainly agree with the so-called Upper St Cassian or Kössen\r\nbeds which form the top of the Trias in the Austrian Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Penarth beds occur in Glamorganshire, Gloucestershire,\r\nWarwickshire, Staffordshire, and the north of Ireland; and they\r\ngenerally consist of a small thickness of grey marls, white\r\nlimestones, and black shales, surmounted conformably by the lowest\r\nbeds of the Lias. The most characteristic fossils which they contain\r\nare the three Bivalves _Cardium Rhoeticum, Avicula contorta_, and\r\n_Pecten Valoniensis_; but they have yielded many other fossils,\r\namongst which the most important are the remains of Fishes and\r\nsmall Mammals (_Microlestes_).\r\n\r\nIn the Austrian Alps the Trias terminates upwards in an extraordinary\r\nseries of fossiliferous beds, replete with marine fossils. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell gives the following table of these remarkable\r\ndeposits:--\r\n\r\n_Strata below the Lias in the Austrian Alps, in descending order._\r\n\r\n                         / Grey and black limestone, with calcareous\r\n                         | marls having a thickness of about 50\r\n                         | feet.

The rocks of these areas consist\r\nof red sandstones, sometimes shaly or conglomeratic, occasionally\r\nwith beds of impure limestone. Other more extensive areas where\r\nTriassic rocks appear at the surface, are found west of the\r\nMississippi, on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, where the\r\nbeds consist of sandstones and gypsiferous marls. The American\r\nTrias is chiefly remarkable for having yielded the remains of a\r\nsmall Marsupial (_Dromatherium_), and numerous footprints, which\r\nhave generally been referred to Birds (_Brontozoum_), along with\r\nthe tracks of undoubted Reptiles (_Otozoum, Anisopus_, &c.)\r\n\r\nThe subjoined section (fig. 139) expresses, in a diagrammatic\r\nmanner, the general sequence of the Triassic rocks when fully\r\ndeveloped, as, for example, in the Bavarian Alps:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE TRIASSIC ROCKS\r\nOF CENTRAL EUROPE.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _life_ of the Triassic period, we have to\r\nnotice a difference as concerns the different members of the group\r\nsimilar to that which has been already mentioned in connection\r\nwith the Permian formation. The arenaceous deposits of the series,\r\nnamely, resemble those of the Permian, not only in being commonly\r\nred or variegated in their colour, but also in their conspicuous\r\npaucity of organic remains. They for the most part are either\r\nwholly unfossiliferous, or they contain the remains of plants or\r\nthe bones of reptiles, such as may easily have been drifted from\r\nsome neighbouring shore. The few fossils which may be considered\r\nas properly belonging to these deposits are chiefly Crustaceans\r\n(_Estheria_) or Fishes, which may well have lived in the waters\r\nof estuaries or vast inland seas. We may therefore conclude,\r\nwith considerable probability, that the barren sandy and marly\r\naccumulations of the Bunter Sandstein and Lower Keuper were not\r\nlaid down in an open sea, but are probably brackish-water deposits,\r\nformed in estuaries or land-locked bodies of salt water. This at\r\nany rate would appear to be the case as regards these members\r\nof the series as developed in Britain and in their typical areas\r\non the continent of Europe; and the origin of most of the North\r\nAmerican Trias would appear to be much the same. Whether this view\r\nbe correct or not, it is certain that the beds in question were laid\r\ndown in _shallow_ water, and in the immediate vicinity of _land_,\r\nas shown by the numerous drifted plants which they contain and\r\nthe common occurrence in them of the footprints of air-breathing\r\nanimals (Birds, Reptiles, and Amphibians). On the other hand, the\r\nmiddle and highest members of the Trias are largely calcareous,\r\nand are replete with the remains of undoubted marine animals. There\r\ncannot, therefore, be the smallest doubt but that the Muschelkalk\r\nand the Rhætic or Kössen beds were slowly accumulated in an open\r\nsea, of at least a moderate depth; and they have preserved for\r\nus a very considerable selection from the marine fauna of the\r\nTriassic period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140.--_Zamia spiralis_, a living Cycad.\r\nAustralia.]\r\n\r\nThe _plants_ of the Trias are, on the whole, as distinctively\r\nMesozoic in their aspect as those of the Permian are Palæozoic.\r\nIn spite, therefore, of the great difficulty which is experienced\r\nin effecting a satisfactory stratigraphical separation between\r\nthe Permian and the Trias, we have in this fact a proof that the\r\ntwo formations were divided by an interval of time sufficient\r\nto allow of enormous changes in the terrestrial vegetation of the\r\nworld. The _Lepidodendroids, Asterophyllites_, and _Annularioe_,\r\nof the Coal and Permian formations, have now apparently wholly\r\ndisappeared: and the Triassic flora consists mainly of Ferns,\r\nCycads, and Conifers, of which only the two last need special\r\nnotice. The _Cycads_ (fig. 140) are true exogenous plants, which\r\nin general form and habit of growth present considerable resemblance\r\nto young Palms, but which in reality are most nearly related to\r\nthe Pines and Firs (_Coniferoe_). The trunk is unbranched, often\r\nmuch shortened, and bears a crown of feathery pinnate fronds.\r\nThe leaves are usually \"circinate\"--they unroll in expanding,\r\nlike the fronds of ferns. The seeds are not protected by a\r\nseed-vessel, but are borne upon the edge of altered leaves, or\r\nare carried on the scales of a cone. All the living species of\r\nCycads are natives of warm countries, such as South America, the\r\nWest Indies, Japan, Australia, Southern Asia, and South Africa.\r\nThe remains of Cycads, as we have seen, are not known to occur\r\nin the Coal formation, or only to a very limited extent towards\r\nits close; nor are they known with certainty as occurring in\r\nPermian deposits. In the Triassic period, however, the remains\r\nof Cycads belonging to such genera as _Pterophyllum_ (fig. 141,\r\nb), _Zamites_, and _Podozamites_ (fig. 141, c), are sufficiently\r\nabundant to constitute quite a marked feature in the vegetation;\r\nand they continue to be abundantly represented throughout the\r\nwhole Mesozoic series. The name \"Age of Cycads,\" as applied to\r\nthe Secondary epoch, is therefore, from a botanical point of\r\nview, an extremely appropriate one. The _Conifers_ of the Trias\r\nare not uncommon, the principal form being _Veltzia_ (fig. 141,\r\na), which possesses some peculiar characters, but would appear\r\nto be most nearly related to the recent Cypresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141.--Triassic Conifers and Cycads. a, _Voltzia_\r\n(_Schizoneura_) _heterophylla_, portion of a branch, Europe and\r\nAmerica; b, Part of the frond of _Pterophyllum Joegeri_, Europe;\r\nc, Part of the frond of _Podozamites lanceolatus_, America.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the _Invertebrate animals_ of the Trias, our knowledge\r\nis still principally derived from the calcareous beds which\r\nconstitute the centre of the system (the Muschelkalk) on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, and from the St Cassain and Rhætic beds\r\nstill higher in the series; whilst some of the Triassic strata\r\nof California and Nevada have likewise yielded numerous remains\r\nof marine Invertebrates. The _Protozoans_ are represented by\r\n_Foraminifera_ and _Sponges_, and the _Coelenterates_ by a small\r\nnumber of _Corals_; but these require no special notice. It may be\r\nmentioned, however, that the great Palæozoic group of the _Rugose_\r\ncorals has no known representative here, its place being taken\r\nby corals of Secondary type (such as _Montlivaltia, Synastoea_,\r\n&c.)\r\n\r\nThe _Echinoderms_ are represented principally by _Crinoids_,\r\nthe remains of which are extremely abundant in some of the\r\nlimestones. The best-known species is the famous \"Lily-Encrinite\"\r\n(_Encrinus liliiformis_, fig. 142), which is characteristic of the\r\nMuschelkalk. In this beautiful species, the flower-like head is\r\nsupported upon a rounded stem, the joints of which are elaborately\r\narticulated with one another; and the fringed arms are composed\r\neach of a double series of alternating calcareous pieces. The\r\nPalæozoic Urchins, with their supernumerary rows of plates, the\r\nCystideans, and the Pentremites have finally disappeared; but\r\nboth Star-fishes and Brittle-stars continue to be represented.\r\nOne of the latter--namely, the _Aspidura loricata_ of Goldfuss\r\n(fig. 143)--is highly characteristic of the Muschelkalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142.--Head and upper part of the column of\r\n_Encrinus liliiformis_. The lower figure shows the articulating\r\nsurface of one of the joints of the column. Muschelkalk, Germany.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143.--_Aspidura loricata_, a Triassic Ophiuroid.\r\nMuschelkalk, Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of _Articulate Animals_ are not very abundant in the\r\nTrias, if we except the bivalved cases of the little Water-fleas\r\n(_Ostracoda_), which are occasionally very plentiful. There are\r\nalso many species of the horny, concentrically-striated valves\r\nof the _Estherioe_ (see fig. 122, b), which might easily be\r\ntaken for small Bivalve Molluscs. The \"Long-tailed\" Decapods\r\nof the type of the Lobster, are not without examples but they\r\nbecome much more numerous in the succeeding Jurassic period.\r\nRemains of insects have also been discovered.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Mollusca_ we have to note the disappearance, amongst\r\nthe lower groups, of many characteristic Palæozoic types. Amongst\r\nthe _Polyzoans_, the characteristic \"Lace-corals,\" _Fenestella,\r\nRetepora_,[22] _Synocladia, Polypora_, &c., have become apparently\r\nextinct. The same is true of many of the ancient types of\r\n_Brachiopods_, and conspicuously so of the great family of the\r\n_Productidoe_, which played such an important part in the seas\r\nof the Carboniferous and Permian periods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The genus _Retefora_ is really a recent one,\r\nrepresented by living forms; and the so-called _Reteporoe_ of the\r\nPalæozoic rocks should properly receive another name (_Phyllopora_),\r\nas being of a different nature. The name _Retepora_ has been here\r\nretained for these old forms simply in accordance with general\r\nusage.]\r\n\r\n[Illustraton: Fig. 144. Triassic Lamellibranchs. a, _Daonella_\r\n(_Halobia_) _Lommelli_; b, _Pecten Valoniensis_; c, _Myophoria\r\nlineata_; d. _Cardium Rhoeticum_; e. _Avicula contorta_; f. _Avicula\r\nsocialis_.]\r\n\r\n_Bivalves_ (_Lamellibranchiata_) and _Univalves_ (_Gasteropoda_)\r\nare well represented in the marine beds of the Trias, and some of the\r\nformer are particularly characteristic either of the formation as a\r\nwhole or of minor subdivisions of it. A few of these characteristic\r\nspecies are figured in the accompanying illustration (fig. 144).\r\nBivalve shells of the genera _Daonella_ (fig. 144, a) and _Halobia_\r\n(_Monotis_) are very abundant, and are found in the Triassic\r\nstrata of almost all regions. These groups belong to the family\r\nof the Pearl-oysters (_Aviculidoe_), and are singular from the\r\nstriking resemblance borne by some of their included forms to\r\nthe _Strophomenoe amongst the Lamp-shells, though, of course, no\r\nreal relation exists between the two. The little Pearl-oyster,\r\n_Avicula socialis_ (fig. 144, f), is found throughout the greater\r\npart of the Triassic series, and is especially abundant in the\r\nMuschelkalk. The genus _Myophoria_ (fig. 144, c), belonging\r\nto the _Trigoniadoe_, and related therefore to the Permian\r\n_Schizodus_, is characteristically Triassic, many species of the\r\ngenus being known in deposits of this age. Lastly, the so-called\r\n\"Rhætic\" or \"Kössen\" beds are characterised by the occurrence\r\nin them of the Scallop, _Pecten Valoniensis_ (fig. 144, b);\r\nthe small Cockle, _Cardium Rhoeticum_ (fig. 144, d); and the\r\ncuriously-twisted Pearl-oyster, _Avicula contorta_ (fig. 144,\r\ne)--this last Bivalve being so abundant that the strata in\r\nquestion are often spoken of as the \"Avicula contorta beds.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145.--_Ceratites nodosus_, viewed from the\r\nside and from behind. Muschelkalk.]\r\n\r\nPassing over the groups of the _Heteropods_ and _Pteropods_, we\r\nhave to notice the _Cephalopoda_, which are represented in the\r\nTrias not only by the chambered shells of _Tetrabranchiates_, but\r\nalso, for the first time, by the internal skeletons of _Dibranchiate_\r\nforms. The Trias, therefore, marks the first recognised appearance\r\nof true Cuttle-fishes. All the known examples of these belong\r\nto the great Mesozoic group of the _Belemnitidoe_; and as this\r\nfamily is much more largely developed in the succeeding Jurassic\r\nperiod, the consideration of its characters will be deferred till\r\nthat formation is treated of. Amongst the chambered _Cephalopods_\r\nwe find quite a number of the Palæozoic _Orthoceratites_, some of\r\nthem of considerable size, along with the ancient _Cyrtoceras_\r\nand _Goniatites_; and these old types, singularly enough, occur\r\nin the higher portion of the Trias (St Cassian beds), but have,\r\nfor some unexplained reason, not yet been recognised in the lower\r\nand equally fossiliferous formation of the Muschelkalk. Along\r\nwith these we meet for the first time with true _Ammonites_,\r\nwhich fill such an extensive place in the Jurassic seas, and\r\nwhich will be spoken of hereafter. The form, however, which is\r\nmost characteristic of the Trias is _Ceratites_ (fig. 145). In\r\nthis genus the shell is curved into a flat spiral, the volutions of\r\nwhich are in contact; and it further agrees with both _Goniatites_\r\nand _Ammonites_ in the fact that the septa or partitions between\r\nthe air-chambers are not simple and plain (as in the _Nautilus_\r\nand its allies), but are folded and bent as they approach the\r\nouter wall of the shell. In the _Goniatite_ these foldings of\r\nthe septa are of a simply lobed or angulated nature, and in the\r\n_Ammonite_ they are extremely complex; whilst in the _Ceratite_\r\nthere is an intermediate state of things, the special feature\r\nof which is, that those foldings which are turned towards the\r\nmouth of the shell are merely rounded, whereas those which are\r\nturned away from the mouth are characteristically toothed. The\r\ngenus _Ceratites_, though principally Triassic, has recently\r\nbeen recognised in strata of Carboniferous age in India.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be gathered that one of the most important\r\npoints in connection with the Triassic _Mollusca_ is the remarkable\r\nintermixture of Palæozoic and Mesozoic types which they exhibit.\r\nIt is to be remembered, also, that this intermixture has hitherto\r\nbeen recognised, not in the Middle Triassic limestones of the\r\nMuschelkalk, in which--as the oldest Triassic beds with marine\r\nfossils--we should naturally expect to find it, but in the St\r\nCassian beds, the age of which is considerably later than that\r\nof the Muschelkalk. The intermingling of old and new types of\r\nShell-fish in the Upper Trias is well brought out in the annexed\r\ntable, given by Sir Charles Lyell in his 'Student's Elements of\r\nGeology' (some of the less important forms in the table being\r\nomitted here):--\r\n\r\nGENERA OF FOSSIL MOLLUSCA IN THE ST CASSIAN AND HALLSTADT BEDS.\r\n\r\n    Common to       |   Characteristic of  |    Common to\r\n    Older Rocks.    |   Triassic Rocks     |    Newer Rocks.\r\n                    |                      |\r\n    Orthoceras.     |    Ceratites.        |    Ammonites.\r\n    Bactrites.      |    Cochloceras.      |    Chemnitzia.\r\n    Macrocheilus.   |    Rhabdoceras.      |    Cerithium.\r\n    Loxonema.       |    Aulacoceras.      |    Monodonta.\r\n    Holopella.      |    Naticella.        |    Sphoera.\r\n    Murchisonia.    |    Platystoma.       |    Cardita.\r\n    Porcellia.      |    Halobia.          |    Myoconcha.\r\n    Athyris.        |    Hörnesia.         |    Hinnites.\r\n    Retzia.         |    Koninckia.        |    Monotis.\r\n    Cyrtina.        |    Scoliostoma.      |    Plicatula.\r\n    Euomphalus.     |    Myophoria.        |    Pachyrisma.\r\n                    |(The last two are     |    Thecidium.\r\n                    |principally but not   |\r\n                    |exclusively Triassic.)|\r\n\r\nThus, to emphasise the more important points alone, the Trias\r\nhas yielded, amongst the Gasteropods, the characteristically\r\nPalæozoic _Loxonema, Holopella, Murchisonia, Euomphalus_, and\r\n_Porcellia_, along with typically Triassic forms like _Platystoma_\r\nand _Scoliostoma_, and the great modern groups _Chemnitzia_ and\r\n_Cerithium_. Amongst the Bivalves we find the Palæozoic _Megalodon_\r\nside by side with the Triassic _Halobia_ and _Myophoria_, these\r\nbeing associated with the _Carditoe, Hinnites, Plicatuloe_, and\r\n_Trigonioe_ of later deposits. The Brachiopods exhibit the Palæozoic\r\n_Athyris, Retzia_, and _Cyrtina_, with the Triassic _Koninckia_\r\nand the modern _Thecidium_. Finally, it is here that the ancient\r\ngenera _Orthoceras, Cyrtoceras_, and _Goniatites_ make their last\r\nappearance upon the scene of life, the place of the last of these\r\nbeing taken by the more complex and almost exclusively Triassic\r\n_Ceratites_, whilst the still more complex genus _Ammonites_ first\r\nappears here in force, and is never again wanting till we reach\r\nthe close of the Mesozoic period. The first representatives of\r\nthe great Secondary family of the _Belemnites_ are also recorded\r\nfrom this horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146.--a, Dental plate of _Ceratodus serratus_,\r\nKeuper; b, Dental plate of _Ceratodus altus_, Keuper; (After\r\nAgassiz.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 147.--_Ceratodus Fosteri_, the Australian\r\nMud-fish, reduced in size.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Vertebrate Animals_ of the Trias, the _Fishes_ are\r\nrepresented by numerous forms belonging to the _Ganoids_ and the\r\n_Placoids_. The Ganoids of the period are still all provided\r\nwith unsymmetrical (\"heterocercal\") tails, and belong principally\r\nto such genera as _Paloeoniscus_ and _Catopterus_. The remains of\r\nPlacoids are in the form of teeth and spines, the two principal\r\ngenera being the two important Secondary groups _Acrodus_ and\r\n_Hybodus_. Very nearly at the summit of the Trias in England, in\r\nthe Rhætic series, is a singular stratum, which is well known as the\r\n\"bone-bed,\" from the number of fish-remains which it contains. More\r\ninteresting, however, than the above, are the curious palate-teeth\r\nof the Trias, upon which Agassiz founded the genus _Ceratodus_.\r\nThe teeth of Ceratodus (fig. 146) are singular flattened plates,\r\ncomposed of spongy bone beneath, covered superficially with a\r\nlayer of enamel. Each plate is approximately triangular, one\r\nmargin (which we now know to be the outer one) being prolonged\r\ninto prongs or conical prominences, whilst the surface is more or\r\nless regularly undulated. Until recently, though the master-mind\r\nof Agassiz recognised that these singular bodies were undoubtedly\r\nthe teeth of fishes, we were entirely ignorant as to their precise\r\nrelation to the animal, or as to the exact affinities of the fish\r\nthus armed. Lately, however, there has been discovered in the\r\nrivers of Queensland (Australia) a living species of _Ceratodus_\r\n(_C. Fosteri_, fig. 147), with teeth precisely similar to those\r\nof its Triassic predecessor; and we thus have become acquainted\r\nwith the use of these structures and the manner in which they\r\nwere implanted in the mouth. The palate carries two of these\r\nplates, with their longer straight sides turned towards each\r\nother, their sharply-sinuated sides turned outwards, and their\r\nshort straight sides or bases directed backwards. Two similar\r\nplates in the lower jaw correspond to the upper, their undulated\r\nsurfaces fitting exactly to those of the opposite teeth. There\r\nare also two sharp-edged front teeth, which are placed in the\r\nfront of the mouth in the upper jaw; but these have not been\r\nrecognised in the fossil specimens. The living _Ceratodus_ feeds\r\non vegetable matters, which are taken up or tom off from plants\r\nby the sharp front teeth, and then partially crushed between\r\nthe undulated surfaces of the back teeth (Günther); and there\r\nneed be little doubt but that the Triassic _Ceratodi_ followed\r\na similar mode of existence. From the study of the living\r\n_Ceratodus_, it is certain that the genus belongs to the same\r\ngroup as the existing Mud-fishes (_Dipnoi_); and we therefore\r\nlearn that this, the highest, group of the entire class of Fishes\r\nexisted in Triassic times under forms little or not at all different\r\nfrom species now alive; whilst it has become probable that the\r\norder can be traced back into the Devonian period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148.--Footprints of a Labyrinthodont\r\n(_Cheirotherium_), from the Triassic Sandstones of Hessberg, near\r\nHildburghausen, Germany, reduced one-eighth.

Trias.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150.--a, Skull of _Labyrinthodon Joegeri_,\r\nmuch reduced in size; b, Tooth of the same. Trias Württemberg.]\r\n\r\nThe _Amphibians_ of the Trias all belong to the old order of\r\nthe _Labyrinthodonts_, and some of them are remarkable for their\r\ngigantic dimensions. They were first known by their footprints,\r\nwhich were found to occur plentifully in the Triassic sandstones\r\nof Britain and the continent of Europe, and which consisted of\r\na double series of alternately-placed pairs of hand-shaped\r\nimpressions, the hinder print of each pair being much larger\r\nthan the one in front (fig. 148). So like were these impressions\r\nto the shape of the human hand, that the at that time unknown\r\nanimal which produced them was at once christened _Cheirotherium_,\r\nor \"Hand-beast.\" Further discoveries, however, soon showed that\r\nthe footprints of _Cheirotherium_ were really produced by species\r\nof Amphibians which, like the existing Frogs, possessed hind-feet\r\nof a much larger size than the fore-feet, and to which the name\r\nof _Labyrinthodonts_ was applied in consequence of the complex\r\nmicroscopic structure of the teeth (fig. 149). In the essential\r\ndetails of their structure, the Triassic Labyrinthodonts did not\r\ndiffer materially from their predecessors in the Coal-measures\r\nand Permian rocks. They possessed the same frog-like skulls (fig.\r\n150), with a lizard-like body, a long tail, and comparatively\r\nfeeble limbs. The hind-limbs were stronger and longer than the\r\nfore-limbs, and the lower surface of the body was protected by an\r\narmour of bony plates. Some of the Triassic Labyrinthodonts must\r\nhave attained dimensions utterly unapproached amongst existing\r\nAmphibians, the skull of _Labyrinthodon Joegeri_ (fig. 150) being\r\nupwards of three feet in length and two feet in breadth. Restorations\r\nof some of these extraordinary creatures have been attempted in\r\nthe guise of colossal Frogs; but they must in reality have more\r\nclosely resembled huge Newts.\r\n\r\nRemains of _Reptiles_ are very abundant in Triassic deposits,\r\nand belong to very varied types. The most marked feature, in\r\nfact, connected with the Vertebrate fauna of the Trias, and of\r\nthe Secondary rocks in general, is the great abundance of Reptilian\r\nlife. Hence the Secondary period is often spoken of as the \"Age\r\nof Reptiles.\" Many of the Triassic reptiles depart widely in\r\ntheir structure from any with which we are acquainted as existing\r\non the earth at the present day, and it is only possible here to\r\nbriefly note some of the more important of these ancient forms.\r\nAmongst the group of the Lizards (_Lacertilia_), represented by\r\n_Protorosaurus_ in the older Permian strata, three types more\r\nor less certainly referable to this order may be mentioned. One\r\nof these is a small reptile which was found many years ago in\r\nsandstones near Elgin, in Scotland, and which excited special\r\ninterest at the time in consequence of the fact that the strata\r\nin question were believed to belong to the Old Red Sandstone\r\nformation. It is, however, now certain that the Elgin sandstones\r\nwhich contain _Telerpeton Elginense_, as this reptile is termed,\r\nare really to be regarded as of Triassic age. By Professor Huxley,\r\n_Telerpeton_ is regarded as a Lizard, which cannot be considered\r\nas \"in any sense a less perfectly-organised creature than the\r\nGecko, whose swift and noiseless run over walls and ceilings\r\nsurprises the traveller in climates warmer than our own.\" The\r\n\"Elgin Sandstones\" have also yielded another Lizard, which was\r\noriginally described by Professor Huxley under the name of\r\n_Hyperodapedon_, the remains of the same genus having been\r\nsubsequently discovered in Triassic strata in India and South\r\nAfrica. The Lizards of this group must therefore have at one\r\ntime enjoyed a very wide distribution over the globe; and the\r\nliving _Sphenodon_ of New Zealand is believed by Professor Huxley\r\nto be the nearest living ally of this family. The _Hyperodapedon_\r\nof the Elgin Sandstones was about six feet in length, with limbs\r\nadapted for terrestrial progression, but with the bodies of the\r\nvertebræ slightly biconcave, and having two rows of palatal teeth,\r\nwhich become worn down to the bone in old age. Lastly, the curious\r\n_Rhynchosaurus_ of the Trias is also referred, by the eminent\r\ncomparative anatomist above mentioned, to the order of the Lizards.\r\nIn this singular reptile (fig. 151) the skull is somewhat bird-like,\r\nand the jaws appear to have been destitute of teeth, and to have\r\nbeen encased in a horny sheath like the beak of a Turtle or a\r\nBird. It is possible, however, that the palate was furnished\r\nwith teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Skull of _Rhynchosaurus articeps_. Trias.\r\n(After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nThe group of the Crocodiles and Alligators (_Crocadilia_),\r\ndistinguished by the fact that the teeth are implanted in distinct\r\nsockets and the skin more or less extensively provided with bony\r\nplates, is represented in the Triassic rocks by the _Stagonolepis_\r\nof the Elgin Sandstones. The so-called \"Thecodont\" reptiles (such\r\nas _Belodon, Thecodontosaurus_, and _Paloeosaurus_, fig. 152,\r\nc, d, e) are also nearly related to the Crocodiles, though\r\nit is doubtful if they should be absolutely referred to this\r\ngroup. In these reptiles, the teeth are implanted in distinct\r\nsockets in the jaws, their crowns being more or less compressed\r\nand pointed, \"with trenchant and finely serrate margins\" (Owen).\r\nThe bodies of the vertebræ are hollowed out at both ends, but\r\nthe limbs appear to be adapted for progression on the land. The\r\ngenus _Belodon_ (fig. 152, c) is known to occur in the Keuper\r\nof Germany and in America; and _Paloeosaurus_ (fig. 153. e)\r\nhas also been found in the Trias of the same region. Teeth of the\r\nlatter, however, are found, along with remains of _Thecodontosaurus_\r\n(fig. 153, d), in a singular magnesian conglomerate near Bristol,\r\nwhich was originally believed to be of Permian age, but which\r\nappears to be undoubtedly Triassic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152.--Triassic Reptiles. a, Skull of\r\n_Nothosaurus mirabilis_, reduced in size--Muschelkalk, Germany; b,\r\nTooth of _Simosaurus Gaillardoti_, of the natural size--Muschelkalk,\r\nGermany; c, Tooth of _Beladon Carolinensis_--Trias, America; d,\r\nTooth of _Thecodontosaurus antiquus_, slightly enlarged--Britain;\r\ne, Tooth of _Paloeosaurus platyodon_, of the natural\r\nsize--Britain.]\r\n\r\nThe Trias has also yielded the remains of the great marine reptiles\r\nwhich are often spoken of collectively as the \"Enaliosaurians\"\r\nor \"Sea-lizards,\" and which will be more particularly spoken\r\nof in treating of the Jurassic period, of which they are more\r\nespecially characteristic. In all these reptiles the limbs are\r\nflattened out, the digits being enclosed in a continuous skin,\r\nthus forming powerful swimming-paddles, resembling the \"flippers\"\r\nof the Whales and Dolphins both in their general structure and\r\nin function. The tail is also long, and adapted to act as a\r\nswimming-organ; and there can be no doubt but that these\r\nextraordinary and often colossal reptiles frequented the sea,\r\nand only occasionally came to the land. The Triassic Enaliosaurs\r\nbelong to a group of which the later genus _Plesiosaurus_ is\r\nthe type (the _Sauropterygia_). One of the best known of the\r\nTriassic genera is _Nothosaurus_ (fig. 152, a), in which the\r\nneck was long and bird-like, the jaws being immensely elongated,\r\nand carrying numerous powerful conical teeth implanted in distinct\r\nsockets. The teeth in _Simosaurus_ (152, b) are of a similar\r\nnature; but the orbits are of enormous size, indicating eyes of\r\ncorresponding dimensions, and perhaps pointing to the nocturnal\r\nhabits of the animal. In the singular _Placodus_, again, the\r\nteeth are in distinct sockets, but resemble those of many fishes\r\nin being rounded and obtuse (fig. 153), forming broad crushing\r\nplates adapted for the comminution of shell-fish. There is a\r\nrow of these teeth all round the upper jaw proper, and a double\r\nseries on the palate, but the lower jaw has only a single row of\r\nteeth. _Placodus_ is found in the Muschelkalk, and the characters\r\nof its dental apparatus indicate that it was much more peaceful\r\nin its habits than its associates the Nothosaur and Simosaur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153.--Under surface of the upper jaw and palate\r\nof _Placodus gigas_. Muschelkalk, Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe Triassic rocks of South Africa and India have yielded the\r\nremains of some extraordinary Reptiles, which have been placed by\r\nProfessor Owen in a separate order under the name of _Anomodontia_.\r\nThe two principal genera of this group are _Dicynodon_ and\r\n_Oudenodon_, both of which appear to have been large Reptiles,\r\nwith well-developed limbs, organised for progression upon the\r\ndry land. In _Oudenodon_ (fig. 154, B) the jaws seem to have\r\nbeen wholly destitute of teeth, and must have been encased in\r\na horny sheath, similar to that with which we are familiar in\r\nthe beak of a Turtle. In _Dicynodon_ (fig. 154, A), on the other\r\nhand, the front of the upper jaw and the whole of the lower jaw\r\nwere destitute of teeth, and the front of the mouth must have\r\nconstituted a kind of beak; but the upper jaw possessed on each\r\nside a single huge conical tusk, which is directed downwards,\r\nand must have continued to grow during the life of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154.--Triassic Anomodont Reptiles. A, Skull\r\nof _Dicynodon lacerticeps_, showing one of the great maxillary\r\ntusks; B, Skull of _Oudenodon Bainii_, showing the toothless,\r\nbeak-like jaws. From the Trias of South Africa. (After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that the above-mentioned Triassic sandstones\r\nof South Africa have recently yielded to the researches of Professor\r\nOwen a new and unexpected type of Reptile, which exhibits some\r\nof the structural peculiarities which we have been accustomed\r\nto regard as characteristic of the Carnivorous quadrupeds. The\r\nReptile in question has been named _Cyanodraco_, and it is looked\r\nupon by its distinguished discoverer as the type of a new order,\r\nto which he has given the name of _Theriodontia_. The teeth of\r\nthis singular form agree with those of the Carnivorous quadrupeds\r\nin consisting of three distinct groups--namely, front teeth or\r\n_incisors_, eye teeth or _canines_, and back teeth or _molars_.\r\nThe canines also are long and pointed, very much compressed, and\r\nhaving their lateral margins finely serrated, thus presenting a\r\nsingular resemblance to the teeth of the extinct \"Sabre-toothed\r\nTiger\" (_Machairodus_). The bone of the upper arm (humerus) further\r\nshows some remarkable resemblances to the same bone in the\r\nCarnivorous Mammals. As has been previously noticed, Professor\r\nOwen is of opinion that some of the Reptilian remains of the\r\nPermian deposits will also be found to belong to this group of\r\nthe \"Theriodonts.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155.--Supposed footprint of a Bird, from\r\nthe Triassic Sandstones of the Connecticut River. The slab shows\r\nalso numerous \"rain-prints.\"]\r\n\r\nLastly, we find in the Triassic rocks the remains of Reptiles\r\nbelonging to the great Mesozoic order of the _Deinosauria_. This\r\norder attains its maximum at a later period, and will be spoken of\r\nwhen the Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits come to be considered.\r\nThe chief interest of the Triassic Reptiles of this group arises\r\nfrom the fact that they are known by their footprints as well as\r\nby their bones; and a question has arisen whether the supposed\r\nfootprints of _birds_ which occur in the Trias have not really\r\nbeen produced by Deinosaurs. This leads us, therefore, to speak\r\nat the same time as to the evidence which we have of the existence\r\nof the class of Birds during the Triassic period. No actual bones\r\nof any bird have as yet been detected in any Triassic deposit;\r\nbut we have tolerably clear evidence of their existence at this\r\ntime in the form of _footprints_. The impressions in question\r\nare found in considerable numbers in certain red sandstones of\r\nthe age of the Trias in the valley of the Connecticut River, in\r\nthe United States. They vary much in size, and have evidently been\r\nproduced by many different animals walking over long stretches of\r\nestuarine mud and sand exposed at low water. The footprints now\r\nunder consideration form a double series of _single_ prints, and\r\ntherefore, beyond all question, are the tracks of a _biped_--that\r\nis, of an animal which walked upon two legs. No living animals,\r\nsave Man and the Birds, walk habitually on two legs; and there\r\nis, therefore, a _primâ facie_ presumption that the authors of\r\nthese prints were Birds. Moreover, each impression consists of\r\nthe marks of three toes turned forwards (fig. 155), and therefore\r\nare precisely such as might be produced by Wading or Cursorial\r\nBirds. Further, the impressions of the toes show exactly the\r\nsame numerical progression in the number of the joints as is\r\nobservable in living Birds--that is to say, the innermost of the\r\nthree toes consists of three joints, the middle one of four, and\r\nthe outer one of five joints. Taking this evidence collectively,\r\nit would have seemed, until lately, quite certain that these\r\ntracks could only have been formed by Birds. It has, however,\r\nbeen shown that the Deinosaurian Reptiles possess, in some cases\r\nat any rate, some singularly bird-like characters, amongst which\r\nis the fact that the animal possessed the power of walking,\r\ntemporarily at least, on its hind-legs, which were much longer and\r\nstronger than the fore-limbs, and which were sometimes furnished\r\nwith no more than three toes. As the bones and teeth of Deinosaurs\r\nhave been found in the Triassic deposits of North America, it\r\nmay be regarded as certain that _some_ of the bipedal tracks\r\noriginally ascribed to Birds must have really been produced by\r\nthese Reptiles. It seems at the same time almost a certainty\r\nthat others of the three-toed impressions of the Connecticut\r\nsandstones were in truth produced by Birds, since it is doubtful\r\nif the bipedal mode of progression was more than an occasional\r\nthing amongst the Deinosaurs, and the greater number of the many\r\nknown tracks exhibit no impressions of fore-feet. Upon the whole,\r\ntherefore, we may, with much probability, conclude that the great\r\nclass of Birds (_Aves_) was in existence in the Triassic period.\r\nIf this be so, not only must there have been quite a number of\r\ndifferent forms, but some of them must have been of very large\r\nsize. Thus the largest footprints hitherto discovered in the\r\nConnecticut sandstones are 22 inches long and 12 inches wide,\r\nwith a proportionate length of stride. These measurements indicate\r\na foot four times as large as that of the African Ostrich; and the\r\nanimal which produced them--whether a Bird or a Deinosaur--must\r\nhave been of colossal dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156.--Lower jaw of _Dromatherium sylvestre_.\r\nTrias, North Carolina. (After Emmons.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 157.--a, Molar tooth of _Micro estes antiquus_,\r\nmagnified; b, Crown of the same, magnified still further. Trias,\r\nGermany.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 158.--The Banded Ant-eater (_Myrmecobius\r\nfasciatus_) of Australia.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the Trias completes the tale of the great classes of the\r\nVertebrate sub-kingdom by presenting us with remains of the first\r\nknown of the true Quadrupeds or _Mammalia_. These are at present only\r\nknown by their teeth, or, in one instance, by one of the halves of\r\nthe lower jaw; and these indicate minute Quadrupeds, which present\r\ngreater affinities with the little Banded Anteater (_Myrmecobius\r\nfasciatus_, fig. 158) of Australia than with any other living form.\r\nIf this conjecture be correct, these ancient Mammals belonged to\r\nthe order of the Marsupials or Pouched Quadrupeds (_Marsupialia_),\r\nwhich are now exclusively confined to the Australian province,\r\nSouth America, and the southern portion of North America. In the\r\nOld World, the only known Triassic Mammals belong to the genus\r\n_Microlestes_, and to the probably identical _Hypsiprymnopsis_ of\r\nProfessor Boyd Dawkins. The teeth of _Microlestes_ (fig. 157)\r\nwere originally discovered by Plieninger in 1847 in the \"bone-bed\"\r\nwhich is characteristic of the summit of the Rhætic series both\r\nin Britain and on the continent of Europe; and the known remains\r\nindicate two species. In Britain, teeth of _Microlestes_ have been\r\ndiscovered by Mr Charles Moore in deposits of Upper Triassic age,\r\nfilling a fissure in the Carboniferous limestone near Frome, in\r\nSomersetshire; and a molar tooth of _Hypsiprymnopsis_ was found\r\nby Professor Boyd Dawkins in Rhætic marls below the \"bone-bed\" at\r\nWatchet, also in Somersetshire. In North America, lastly, there\r\nhas been found in strata of Triassic age one of the branches\r\nof the lower jaw of a small Mammal, which has been described\r\nunder the name of _Dromatherium sylvestre_ (fig. 156). The fossil\r\nexhibits ten small molars placed side by side, one canine, and\r\nthree incisors, separated by small intervals, and it indicates\r\na small insectivorous animal, probably most nearly related to\r\nthe existing _Myrmecobius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following list comprises a few of the more important sources of\r\ninformation as to the Triassic strata and their fossil contents:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames.'

Sediments of this series\r\noccupy extensive areas in Great Britain, on the continent of\r\nEurope, and in India. In North America, limestones and marls\r\nof this age have been detected in \"the Black Hills, the Laramie\r\nrange, and other eastern ridges of the Rocky Mountains; also\r\nover the Pacific slope, in the Uintah, Wahsatch, and Humboldt\r\nMountains, and in the Sierra Nevada\" (Dana); but in these regions\r\ntheir extent is still unknown, and their precise subdivisions\r\nhave not been determined. Strata belonging to the Jurassic period\r\nare also known to occur in South America, in Australia, and in\r\nthe Arctic zone. When fully developed, the Jurassic series is\r\ncapable of subdivision into a number of minor groups, of which\r\nsome are clearly distinguished by their mineral characters, whilst\r\nothers are separated with equal certainty by the differences of\r\nthe fossils that they contain. It will be sufficient for our\r\npresent purpose, without entering into the more minute subdivisions\r\nof the series, to give here a very brief and general account\r\nof the main sub-groups of the Jurassic rocks, as developed in\r\nBritain--the arrangement of the Jura-formation of the continent\r\nof Europe agreeing in the main with that of England.\r\n\r\nI. THE LIAS.--The base of the Jurassic series of Britain is formed\r\nby the great calcareo-argillaceous deposit of the \"Lias,\" which\r\nusually rests conformably and almost inseparably upon the Rhætic\r\nbeds (the so-called \"White Lias\"), and passes up, generally\r\nconformably, into the calcareous sandstones of the Inferior Oolite.\r\nThe Lias is divisible into the three principal groups of the Lower,\r\nMiddle, and Upper Lias, as under, and these in turn contain many\r\nwell-marked \"zones;\" so that the Lias has some claims to be\r\nconsidered as an independent formation, equivalent to all the\r\nremaining Oolitic rocks. The _Lower Lias_ (_Terrain Sinemurien_ of\r\nD'Orbigny) sometimes attains a thickness of as much as 600 feet,\r\nand consists of a great series of bluish or greyish laminated\r\nclays, alternating with thin bands of blue or grey limestone--the\r\nwhole, when seen in quarries or cliffs from a little distance,\r\nassuming a characteristically striped and banded appearance. By\r\nmeans of particular species of _Ammonites_, taken along with\r\nother fossils which are confined to particular zones, the Lower\r\nLias may be subdivided into several well-marked horizons. The\r\n_Middle Lias_, or _Marlstone Series_ (_Terrain Liasien_ of\r\nD'Orbigny), may reach a thickness of 200 feet, and consists of\r\nsands, arenaceous marls, and argillaceous limestones, sometimes\r\nwith ferruginous beds. The _Upper Lias_ (_Terrain Toarcien_ of\r\nD'Orbigny) attains a thickness of 300 feet, and consists principally\r\nof shales below, passing upwards into arenaceous strata.\r\n\r\nII. THE LOWER OOLITES.--Above the Lias comes a complex series of\r\npartly arenaceous and argillaceous, but principally calcareous\r\nstrata, of which the following are the more important groups:\r\na, The _Inferior Oolite_ (_Terrain Bajocien_ of D'Orbigny),\r\nconsisting of more than 200 feet of oolitic limestones, sometimes\r\nmore or less sandy; b, The _Fuller's Earth_, a series of shales,\r\nclays, and marls, about 120 feet in thickness; c, The _Great\r\nOolite_ or _Bath Oolite_ (_Terrain Bathonien_ of D'Orbigny),\r\nconsisting principally of oolitic limestones, and attaining a\r\nthickness of about 130 feet. The well-known \"Stonesfield Slates\"\r\nbelong to this horizon; and the locally developed \"Bradford Clay,\"\r\n\"Corn brash,\" and \"Forest-marble\" may be regarded as constituting\r\nthe summit of this group.\r\n\r\nIII. THE MIDDLE OOLITES.--The central portion of the Jurassic\r\nseries of Britain is formed by a great argillaceous deposit,\r\ncapped by calcareous strata, as follows: a, The _Oxford Clay_\r\n(_Terrain Callovien_ and _Terrain Oxfordien_ of D'Orbigny),\r\nconsisting of dark-coloured laminated clays, sometimes reaching\r\na thickness of 700 feet, and in places having its lower portion\r\ndeveloped into a hard calcareous sandstone (\"Kelloway Rock\");\r\nb, The Coral-Rag (_Terrain Corallien_ of D'Orbigny, \"Nerinean\r\nLimestone\" of the Jura, \"Diceras Limestone\" of the Alps), consisting,\r\nwhen typically developed, of a central mass of oolitic limestone,\r\nunderlaid and surmounted by calcareous grits.\r\n\r\nIV. THE UPPER OOLITES.--a, The base of the Upper Oolites of\r\nBritain is constituted by a great thickness (600 feet or more)\r\nof laminated, sometimes carbonaceous or bituminous clays, which\r\nare known as the _Kimmeridge Clay_ (_Terrain Kimméridgien_ of\r\nD'Orbigny); b, The _Portland Beds_ (_Terrain Portlandien_ of\r\nD'Orbigny) succeed the Kimmeridge clay, and consist inferiorly of\r\nsandy beds surmounted by oolitic limestones (\"Portland Stone\"),\r\nthe whole series attaining a thickness of 150 feet or more, and\r\ncontaining marine fossils; c, The _Purbeck_ Beds are apparently\r\npeculiar to Great Britain, where they form the summit of the entire\r\nOolitic series, attaining a total thickness of from 150 to 200\r\nfeet. The Purbeck beds consist of arenaceous, argillaceous, and\r\ncalcareous strata, which can be shown by their fossils to consist\r\nof a most remarkable alternation of fresh-water, brackish-water,\r\nand purely marine sediments, together with old land-surfaces,\r\nor vegetable soils, which contain the upright stems of trees,\r\nand are locally known as \"Dirt-beds.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the Jurassic deposits of the continent\r\nof Europe, which is believed to be on the horizon of the Coral-rag\r\nor of the lower part of the Upper Oolites, is the \"_Solenhofen\r\nSlate_\" of Bavaria, an exceedingly fine-grained limestone, which\r\nis largely used in lithography, and is celebrated for the number\r\nand beauty of its organic remains, and especially for those of\r\nVertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined sketch-section (fig. 159) exhibits in a diagrammatic\r\nform the general succession of the Jurassic rocks of Britain.\r\n\r\nRegarded as a whole, the Jurassic formation is essentially marine;\r\nand though remains of drifted plants, and of insects and other\r\nair-breathing animals, are not uncommon, the fossils of the formation\r\nare in the main marine. In the Purbeck series of Britain,\r\nanticipatory of the great river-deposit of the Wealden, there are\r\nfresh-water, brackish-water, and even terrestrial strata, indicating\r\nthat the floor of the Oolitic ocean was undergoing upheaval, and\r\nthat the marine conditions which had formerly prevailed were nearly\r\nat an end. In places also, as in Yorkshire and Sutherlandshire,\r\nare found actual beds of coal: but the great bulk of the formation\r\nis an indubitable sea-deposit; and its limestones, oolitic as\r\nthey commonly are, nevertheless are composed largely of the\r\ncomminuted skeletons of marine animals. Owing to the enormous\r\nnumber and variety of the organic remains which have been yielded\r\nby the richly fossiliferous strata of the Oolitic series, it will\r\nnot be possible here to do more than to give an outline-sketch\r\nof the principal forms of life which characterise the Jurassic\r\nperiod as a whole. It is to be remembered, however, that every\r\nminor group of the Jurassic formation has its own peculiar fossils,\r\nand that by the labours of such eminent observers as Quenstedt,\r\nOppel, D'Orbigny, Wright, De la Beche, Tate, and others, the\r\nentire series of Jurassic sediments admits of a more complete\r\nand more elaborate subdivision into zones characterised by special\r\nlife-forms than has as yet been found practicable in the case\r\nof any other rock-series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE JURASSIC ROCKS\r\nOF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160.--_Mantellia_ (_Cycadeoidea_) _megalophylla_,\r\na Cycad from the Purbeck \"dirt-bed.\" Upper Oolites, England.]\r\n\r\nThe _plants_ of the Jurassic period consist principally of Ferns,\r\nCycads, and Conifers--agreeing in this respect, therefore, with\r\nthose of the preceding Triassic formation. The _Ferns_ are very\r\nabundant, and belong partly to old and partly to new genera. The\r\n_Cycads_ are also very abundant, and, on the whole, constitute the\r\nmost marked feature of the Jurassic vegetation, many genera of this\r\ngroup being known (_Pterophyllum, Otozamites, Zamites, Crossozamia,\r\nWilliamsonia, Bucklandia,_ &c.) The so-called \"dirt-bed\" of the\r\nPurbeck series consists of an ancient soil, in which stand erect\r\nthe trunks of Conifers and the silicified stools of Cycads of\r\nthe genus _Mantellia_ (fig.160). The _Coniferoe_ of the Jurassic\r\nare represented by various forms more or less nearly allied to\r\nthe existing _Araucarioe_; and these are known not only by their\r\nstems or branches, but also in some cases by their cones. We\r\nmeet, also, with the remains of undoubted Endogenous plants,\r\nthe most important of which are the fruits of forms allied to\r\nthe existing Screw-pines (_Pandaneoe_), such as _Podocarya_ and\r\n_Kaidacarpum_. So far, however, no remains of Palms have been\r\nfound; nor are we acquainted with any Jurassic plants which could\r\nbe certainly referred to the great \"Angiospermous\" group of the\r\nExogens, including the majority of our ordinary plants and trees.\r\n\r\nAmongst animals, the _Protozoans_ are well represented in the\r\nJurassic deposits by numerous _Foraminifers_ and _Sponges_; as\r\nare the _Coelenterates_ by numerous _Corals_. Remains of these\r\nlast-mentioned organisms are extremely abundant in some of the\r\nlimestones of the formation, such as the \"Coral-rag\" and the\r\nGreat Oolite; and the former of these may fairly be considered\r\nas an ancient \"reef.\" The _Rugose Corals_ have not hitherto been\r\ndetected in the Jurassic rocks; and the \"_Tabulate Corals_,\"\r\nso-called, are represented only by examples of the modern genus\r\n_Millepora_. With this exception, all the Jurassic Corals belong\r\nto the great group which predominates in recent seas (_Zoantharia\r\nsclerodermata_); and the majority belong to the important\r\nreef-building family of the \"Star-corals\" (_Astroeidoe_). The\r\nform here figured (_Thecosmilia annularis_, fig. 161) is one\r\nof the characteristic species of the Coral-rag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161.--_Thecosmilia annularis_, Coral-rag,\r\nEngland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162.--_Pentacrinus fasciculos_, Lias. The\r\nleft-hand figure shows a few or the joints of the column; the\r\nmiddle figure shows the arms, and the summit of the column with\r\nits side-arms; and the right-hand figure shows the articulating\r\nsurface of one of the column-joints.]\r\n\r\nThe _Echinoderms_ are very numerous and abundant fossils in the\r\nJurassic series, and are represented by Sea-lilies, Sea-urchins,\r\nStar-fishes, and Brittle-stars. The _Crinoids_ are still common,\r\nand some of the limestones of the series are largely composed\r\nof the _débris_ of these organisms. Most of the Jurassic forms\r\nresemble those with which we are already familiar, in having\r\nthe body permanently attached to some foreign object by means\r\nof a longer or shorter jointed stalk or \"column.\" One of the\r\nmost characteristic Jurassic genera of these \"stalked\" Crinoids\r\n(though not exclusively confined to this period) is _Pentacrinus_\r\n(fig. 162). In this genus, the column is five-sided, with whorls\r\nof \"side-arms;\" and the arms are long, slender, and branched.\r\nThe genus is represented at the present day by the beautiful\r\n\"Medusa-head Pentacrinite\" (_Pentacrinus caput-medusoe_). Another\r\ncharacteristic Oolitic genus is _Apiocrinus_, comprising the\r\nso-called \"Pear Encrinites.\" In this group the column is long\r\nand rounded, with a dilated base, and having its uppermost joints\r\nexpanded so as to form, with the cup itself, a pear-shaped mass,\r\nfrom the summit of which spring the comparatively short arms.\r\nBesides the \"stalked\" Crinoids, the Jurassic rocks have yielded\r\nthe remains of the higher group of the \"free\" Crinoids, such as\r\n_Saccosoma_. These forms resemble the existing \"Feather-stars\"\r\n(_Comatula_) in being attached when young to some foreign body by\r\nmeans of a jointed stem, from which they detach themselves when\r\nfully grown to lead an independent existence. In this later stage\r\nof their life, therefore, they closely resemble the Brittle-stars\r\nin appearance. True Star-fishes (_Asteroids_) and Brittle-stars\r\n(_Ophiuroids_) are abundant in the Jurassic rocks, and the\r\nSea-urchins (_Echinoids_) are so numerous and so well preserved\r\nas to constitute quite a marked feature of some beds of the series.\r\nAll the Oolitic urchins agree with the modern _Echinoids_ in\r\nhaving the shell composed of no more than twenty rows of plates.\r\nMany different genera are known, and a characteristic species\r\nof the Middle Oolites (_Hemicidaris crenularis_, fig. 163) is\r\nhere figured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163.--_Hemicidaris crenularis_, showing the\r\ngreat tubercles on which the spines were supported. Middle Oolites.]\r\n\r\nPassing over the _Annelides_, which, though not uncommon, are\r\nof little special interest, we come to the _Articulates_, which\r\nalso require little notice. Amongst the _Crustaceans_, whilst\r\nthe little Water-fleas (_Ostracoda_) are still abundant, the\r\nmost marked feature is the predominance which is now assumed by\r\nthe _Decapods_--the highest of the known groups of the class.\r\nTrue Crabs (_Brachyura_) are by no means unknown; but the principal\r\nOolitic Decapods belonged to the \"Long-tailed\" group (_Macrura_),\r\nof which the existing Lobsters, Prawns, and Shrimps are members.\r\nThe fine-grained lithographic slates of Solenhofen are especially\r\nfamous as a depot for the remains of these Crustaceans, and a\r\ncharacteristic species from this locality (_Eryon arctiformis_,\r\nfig. 164) is here represented. Amongst the air-breathing\r\n_Articulates_, we meet in the Oolitic rocks with the remains of\r\nSpiders (_Arachnida_), Centipedes (_Myriapoda_), and numerous\r\ntrue Insects (_Insecta_). In connection with the last-mentioned\r\nof these groups, it is of interest to note the occurrence of\r\nthe oldest known fossil Butterfly--the _Paloeontina Oolitica_\r\nof the Stonesfield slate--the relationships of which appear to\r\nbe with some of the living Butterflies of Tropical America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164.--_Eryon arctiformis_, a \"Long-tailed\r\nDecapod,\" from the Middle Oolites (Solenhofen Slate).]\r\n\r\nComing to the _Mollusca_, the _Polyzoans_, numerous and beautiful\r\nas they are, must be at once dismissed; but the _Brachiopods_\r\ndeserve a moment's attention. The Jurassic Lamp-shells (fig.\r\n165) do not fill by any means such a predominant place in the\r\nmarine fauna of the period, as in many Palæozoic deposits, but\r\nthey are still individually numerous. The two ancient genera\r\n_Leptoena_ (fig. 165, a) and _Spirifera_ (fig. 165, b), dating\r\nthe one from the Lower and the other from the Upper Silurian,\r\nappear here for the last time upon the scene, but they have not\r\nhitherto been recognised in deposits later than the Lias. The\r\ngreat majority of the Jurassic _Brachiopods_, however, belong to\r\nthe genera _Terebratula_ (fig. 165, c, e, f) and _Rhynchonella_\r\n(fig. 165. d), both of which are represented by living forms\r\nat the present day. The _Terebratuloe_, in particular, are very\r\nabundant, and the species are often confined to special horizons\r\nin the series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165.--Jurassic Brachiopod. a. _Leptoena\r\nLiassica_, enlarged, the small cross below the figure indicating\r\nthe true size of the shell--Lias; b, _Spirifera rostrata_, Lias;\r\nc, _Terebratula quadrifida_, Lias; d, d', _Rhynchonella varians_,\r\nFulter's Earth and Kelloway Rock; e, _Terebratula sphoeroidalis_,\r\nInferior Oolite; f, _Terebratula digona_, Bradford Clay,\r\nForest-marble, and Great Oolite. (After Davidson).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166.--_Ostrea Marshii_. Middle and Lower\r\nOolites.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167.--_Gryphoea incurva_. Lias.]\r\n\r\nRemains of _Bivalves_ (_Lamellibranchiata_) are very numerous in\r\nthe Jurassic deposits, and in many cases highly characteristic.\r\nIn the marine beds of the Oolites, which constitute by far the\r\ngreater portion of the whole formation, the Bivalyes are of course\r\nmarine, and belong to such genera as _Trigonia, Lima, Pholadomya,\r\nCardinia, Avicula, Hippopodium_, &c.; but in the Purbeck beds, at\r\nthe summit of the series, we find bands of Oysters alternating\r\nwith strata containing fresh-water or brackish-water Bivalves,\r\nsuch as _Cyrenoe_ and _Corbuloe_. The predominant Bivalves of\r\nthe Jurassic, however, are the _Oysters_, which occur under many\r\nforms, and often in vast numbers, particular species being commonly\r\nrestricted to particular horizons. Thus of the true Oysters,\r\n_Ostrea distorta_ is characteristic of the Purbeck series, where\r\nit forms a bed twelve feet in thickness, known locally as the\r\n\"Cinder-bed;\" _Ostrea expansa_ abounds in the Portland beds;\r\n_Ostrea deltoidea_ is characteristic of the Kimmeridge clay;\r\n_Ostrea gregaria_ predominates in the Coral-rag; _Ostrea acuminata_\r\ncharacterises the small group of the Fuller's Earth; whilst the\r\nplaited _Ostrea Marshii_ (fig. 166) is a common shell in the\r\nLower and Middle Oolites. Besides the more typical Oysters, the\r\nOolitic rocks abound in examples of the singularly unsymmetrical\r\nforms belonging to the genera _Exogyra_ and _Gryphoea_ (fig.\r\n167). In the former of these are included Oysters with the beaks\r\n\"reversed\"--that is to say, turned towards the hinder part of\r\nthe shell; whilst in the latter are Oysters in which the lower\r\nvalve of the shell is much the largest, and has a large incurved\r\nbeak, whilst the upper valve is small and concave. One of the\r\nmost characteristic _Exogyroe_ is the _E. Virgula_ of the Oxford\r\nClay, and of the same horizon on the Continent; and the _Gryphoea\r\nincurva_ (fig. 167) is equally abundant in, and characteristic\r\nof, the formation of the Lias. Lastly, we may notice the\r\nextraordinary shells belonging to the genus _Diceras_ (fig. 168),\r\nwhich are exclusively confined to the Middle Oolites. In this\r\nformation in the Alps they occur in such abundance as to give\r\nrise to the name of \"Calcaire à Dicerates,\" applied to beds of\r\nthe same age as the Coral-rag of Britain. The genus _Diceras_\r\nbelongs to the same family as the \"Thorny Clams\" (Chama) of the\r\npresent day--the shell being composed of nearly equally-sized\r\nvalves, the beaks of which are extremely prominent and twisted\r\ninto a spiral. The shell was attached to some foreign body by\r\nthe beak of one of its valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 168.--_Diceras arietina_. Middle Oolite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169.--_Nerinoea Goodhallii_, one-fourth of the\r\nnatural size. The left-hand figure shows the appearance presented\r\nby the shell when vertically divided. Coral-rag, England.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Jurassic Univalves (_Gasteropoda_) there are many\r\nexamples of the ancient and long-lived _Pleurotomaria_; but on\r\nthe whole the Univalves begin to have a modern aspect. The\r\nround-mouthed (\"holostomatous\"), vegetable-eating Sea-snails,\r\nsuch as the Limpets (_Patellidoe_), the Nerites (_Nerita_), the\r\n_Turritelloe, Chemnitzioe_, &c., still hold a predominant place.\r\nThe two most noticeable genera of this group are _Cerithium_\r\nand _Nerinoea_--the former of these attaining great importance\r\nin the Tertiary and Recent seas, whilst the latter (fig. 169)\r\nis highly characteristic of the Jurassic series, though not\r\nexclusively confined to it. One of the limestones of the Jura,\r\nbelieved to be of the age of the Coral-rag (Middle Oolite) of\r\nBritain, abounds to such an extent in the turreted shells of\r\n_Nerinoea_ as to have gained the name of \"Calcaire à Nérinées.\"\r\nIn addition to forms such as the preceding, we now for the first\r\ntime meet, in any force, with the Carnivorous Univalves, in which\r\nthe mouth of the shell is notched or produced into a canal, giving\r\nrise to the technical name of \"siphonostomatous\" applied to the\r\nshell. Some of the carnivorous forms belong to extinct types,\r\nsuch as the _Purpuroidea_ of the Great Oolite; but others are\r\nreferable to well-known existing genera. Thus we meet here with\r\nspecies of the familiar groups of the Whelks (_Buccinum_), the\r\nSpindle-shells (_Fusus_), the Spider-shells (_Pteroceras_), _Murex,\r\nRostellaria_, and others which are not at present known to occur\r\nin any earlier formation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Wing-shells (_Pteropoda_), it is sufficient to mark\r\nthe final appearance in the Lias of the ancient genus _Conularia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170.--_Ammonites Humphresianus_. Inferior\r\nOolite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171.--_Ammonites bifrons_. Lias.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the order of the _Cephalopoda_, in both its Tetrabranchiate\r\nand Dibranchiate sections, undergoes a vast development in the\r\nJurassic period. The old and comparatively simple genus _Nautilus_\r\nis still well represented, one species being very similar to the\r\nliving Pearly Nautilus (_N. Pompilius_); but the _Orthocerata_\r\nand _Goniatites_ of the Trias have finally disappeared; and the\r\ngreat majority of the Tetrabranchiate forms are referable to\r\nthe comprehensive genus _Ammonites_, with its many sub-genera\r\nand its hundreds of recorded species. The shell in _Ammonites_\r\nis in the form of a flat spiral, all the coils of which are in\r\ncontact (figs. 170 and 171). The innermost whorls of the shell\r\nare more or less concealed; and the body-chamber is elongated\r\nand narrow, rather than expanded towards the mouth. The tube or\r\nsiphuncle which runs through the air-chambers is placed on the\r\ndorsal or _convex_ side of the shell; but the principal character\r\nwhich distinguishes _Ammonites_ from _Goniatites_ and _Ceratites_ is\r\nthe wonderfully complex manner in which the _septa_, or partitions\r\nbetween the air-chambers, are folded and undulated. To such an\r\nextent does this take place, that the edges of the septa, when\r\nexposed by the removal of the shell-substance, present in an\r\nexaggerated manner the appearance exhibited by an elaborately-dressed\r\nshirt-frill when viewed edgewise. The species of _Ammonites_ range\r\nfrom the Carboniferous to the Chalk; but they have not been found\r\nin deposits older than the Secondary, in any region except India;\r\nand they are therefore to be regarded as essentially Mesozoic\r\nfossils. Within these limits, each formation is characterised by\r\nparticular species, the number of individuals being often very\r\ngreat, and the size which is sometimes attained being nothing short\r\nof gigantic. In the Lias, particular species of _Ammonites_ may\r\nsucceed one another regularly, each having a more or less definite\r\nhorizon, which it does not transgress. It is thus possible to\r\ndistinguish a certain number of zones, each characterised by\r\na particular Ammonite, together with other associated fossils.\r\nSome of these zones are very persistent and extend over very\r\nwide areas, thus affording valuable aid to the geologist in his\r\ndetermination of rocks. It is to be remembered, however, that\r\nthere are other species which are not thus restricted in their\r\nvertical range, even in the same formations in which definite\r\nzones occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustartion: Fig. 172.--_Beloteuthis subcostata_ Jurassic (Lias).]\r\n\r\nThe Cuttle-fishes or _Dibranchiate Cephalopods_ constitute a\r\nfeature in the life of the Jurassic period little less conspicuous\r\nand striking than that afforded by the multitudinous and varied\r\nchambered shells of the _Ammonitidoe_. The remains by which these\r\nanimals are recognised are necessarily less perfect, as a rule,\r\nthan those of the latter, as no external shell is present (except\r\nin rare and more modern groups), and the internal skeleton is\r\nnot necessarily calcareous. Nevertheless, we have an ample record\r\nof the Cuttle-fishes of the Jurassic period, in the shape of\r\nthe fossilised jaws or beak, the ink-bag, and, most commonly\r\nof all, the horny or calcareous structure which is embedded in\r\nthe soft tissues, and is variously known as the \"pen\" or \"bone.\"\r\nThe beaks of Cuttle-fishes, though not abundant, are sufficiently\r\nplentiful to have earned for themselves the general title of\r\n\"Rhyncholites;\" and in their form and function they resemble\r\nthe horny, parrot-like beak of the existing Cephalopods. The\r\nink-bag or leathery sac in which the Cuttle-fishes store up the\r\nblack pigment with which they obscure the water when attacked,\r\nowes its preservation to the fact that the colouring-matter which\r\nit contains is finely-divided carbon, and therefore nearly\r\nindestructible except by heat. Many of these ink-bags have been\r\nfound in the Lias; and the colouring-matter is sometimes so well\r\npreserved that it has been, as an experiment, employed in painting\r\nas a fossil \"sepia.\" The \"pens\" of the Cuttle-fishes are not\r\ncommonly preserved, owing to their horny consistence, but they\r\nare not unknown. The form here figured (_Beloteuthis subcostata_,\r\nfig. 172) belonged to an old type essentially similar to our modern\r\nCalamaries, the skeleton of which consists of a horny shaft and\r\ntwo lateral wings, somewhat like a feather in general shape. When,\r\non the other hand, the internal skeleton is calcareous, then it is\r\nvery easily preserved in a fossil condition; and the abundance of\r\nremains of this nature in the Secondary rocks, combined with their\r\napparent total absence in Palæozoic strata, is a strong presumption\r\nin favour of the view that the order of the Cuttle-fishes did\r\nnot come into existence till the commencement of the Mesozoic\r\nperiod. The great majority of the skeletons of this kind which are\r\nfound in the Jurassic rocks belong to the great extinct family\r\nof the \"Belemnites\" (_Belemnitidoa_), which, so far as known, is\r\nentirely confined to rocks of Secondary age. From its pointed,\r\ngenerally cylindro-conical form, the skeleton of the Belemnite is\r\npopularly known as a \"thunderbolt\". (fig. 173, C). In its perfect\r\ncondition--in which it is, however, rarely obtainable--the skeleton\r\nconsists of a chambered conical shell (the \"phragmacone\"), the\r\npartitions between the chambers of which are pierced by a marginal\r\ntube or \"siphuncle.\" This conical shell--curiously similar in its\r\nstructure to the _external_ shell of the Nautilus--is extended\r\nforwards into a horny \"pen,\" and is sunk in a corresponding conical\r\npit (fig. 173, B), excavated in the substance of a nearly cylindrical\r\nfibrous body or \"guard,\" which projects backwards for a longer or\r\nshorter distance, and is the part most usually found in a fossil\r\ncondition. Many different kinds of _Belemnites_ are known, and\r\ntheir guards literally swarm in many parts of the Jurassic series,\r\nwhilst some specimens attain very considerable dimensions. Not\r\nonly is the internal skeleton known, but specimens of _Belemnites_\r\nand the nearly allied _Belemnoteuthis_ have been found in some\r\nof the fine-grained sediments of the Jurassic formation, from\r\nwhich much has been learnt even as to the anatomy of the soft\r\nparts of the animal. Thus we know that the Belemnites were in\r\nmany respects comparable with the existing Calamaries or Squids,\r\nthe body being furnished with lateral fins, and the head carrying\r\na circle of ten \"arms,\" two of which were longer than the others\r\n(fig. 173, A). The suckers on the arms were provided, further,\r\nwith horny hooks; there was a large ink-sac; and the mouth was\r\narmed with horny mandibles resembling in shape the beak of a\r\nparrot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173.--A, Restoration of the animal of the\r\nBelemnite; B, Diagram showing the complete skeleton of a Belemnite,\r\nconsisting of the chambered phragmacone (a), the guard (b), and\r\nthe horny pen (c); C, Specimen of _Belemnites canaliculatus_,\r\nfrom the Inferior Oolite. (After Phillips.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174.--_Tetragonolepis (restored), and scales\r\nof the same. Lias.]\r\n\r\nComing next to the _Vertebrates_, we find that the Jurassic _Fishes_\r\nare still represented by _Ganoids_ and _Placoids_. The Ganoids,\r\nhowever, unlike the old forms, now for the most part possess\r\nnearly or quite symmetrical (\"homocercal\") tails. A characteristic\r\ngenus is _Tetragonolepis_ (fig. 174), with its deep compressed\r\nbody, its rhomboidal, closely-fitting scales, and its single\r\nlong dorsal fin. Amongst the _Placoids_ the teeth of true Sharks\r\n(_Notidanus_) occur for the first time; but by far the greater\r\nnumber of remains referable to this group are still the fin-spines\r\nand teeth of \"Cestracionts,\" resembling the living Port-Jackson\r\nShark. Some of these teeth are pointed (_Hybodus_); but others\r\nare rounded, and are adapted for crushing shell-fish. Of these\r\nlatter, the commonest are the teeth of _Acrodus_ (fig. 175), of\r\nwhich the hinder ones are of an elongated form, with a rounded\r\nsurface, covered with fine transverse striæ proceeding from a\r\ncentral longitudinal line. From their general form and striation,\r\nand their dark colour, these teeth are commonly called \"fossil\r\nleeches\" by the quarrymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175.--Tooth of _Acrodus nobilis_. Lias.]\r\n\r\nThe Amphibian group of the _Labyrinthodonts_, which was so\r\nextensively developed in the Trias, appears to have become extinct,\r\nno representative of the order having hitherto been detected in\r\nrocks of Jurassic age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176.--_Ichthyosaurus communis. Lias.]\r\n\r\nMuch more important than the Fishes of the Jurassic series are\r\nthe _Reptiles_, which are both very numerous, and belong to a\r\ngreat variety of types, some of these being very extraordinary\r\nin their anatomical structure. The predominant group is that\r\nof the \"Enaliosaurs\" or \"Sea-lizards,\" divided into two great\r\norders, represented respectively by the _Ichthyosaurus_ and the\r\n_Plesiosaurus_.\r\n\r\nThe _Ichthyosauri_ or \"Fish-Lizards\" are exclusively Mesozoic\r\nin their distribution, ranging from the Lias to the Chalk, but\r\nabounding especially in the former. They were huge Reptiles, of\r\na fish-like form, with a hardly conspicuous neck (fig. 176),\r\nand probably possessing a simply smooth or wrinkled skin, since\r\nno traces of scales or bony integumentary plates have ever been\r\ndiscovered. The tail was long, and was probably furnished at its\r\nextremity with a powerful expansion of the skin, constituting a\r\ntail-fin similar to that possessed by the Whales. The limbs are\r\nalso like those of Whales in the essentials of their structure,\r\nand in their being adapted to act as swimming-paddles. Unlike\r\nthe Whales, however, the Ichthyosaurs possessed the hind-limbs\r\nas well as the fore-limbs, both pairs having the bones flattened\r\nout and the fingers completely enclosed in the skin, the arm\r\nand leg being at the same time greatly shortened. The limbs are\r\nthus converted into efficient \"flippers,\" adapting the animal\r\nfor an active existence in the sea. The different joints of the\r\nbackbone (vertebræ) also show the same adaptation to an aquatic\r\nmode of life, being hollowed out at both ends, like the biconcave\r\nvertebræ of Fishes. The spinal column in this way was endowed\r\nwith the flexibility necessary for an animal intended to pass\r\nthe greater part of its time in water. Though the _Ichthyosaurs_\r\nare undoubtedly marine animals, there is, however, reason to\r\nbelieve that they occasionally came on shore, as they possess\r\na strong bony arch, supporting the fore-limbs, such as would\r\npermit of partial, if laborious, terrestrial progression. The\r\nhead is of enormous size, with greatly prolonged jaws, holding\r\nnumerous powerful conical teeth lodged in a common groove. The\r\nnature of the dental apparatus is such as to leave no doubt as\r\nto the rapacious and predatory habits of the Ichthyosaurs--an\r\ninference which is further borne out by the examination of their\r\npetrified droppings, which are known to geologists as \"coprolites,\"\r\nand which contain numerous fragments of the bones and scales\r\nof the Ganoid fishes which inhabited the same seas. The orbits\r\nare of huge size; and as the eyeball was protected, like that\r\nof birds, by a ring of bony plates in its outer coat, we even\r\nknow that the pupils of the eyes were of correspondingly large\r\ndimensions. As these bony plates have the function of protecting\r\nthe eye from injury under sudden changes of pressure in the\r\nsurrounding medium, it has been inferred, with great probability,\r\nthat the Ichthyosaurs were in the habit of diving to considerable\r\ndepths in the sea. Some of the larger specimens of _Ichthyosaurus_\r\nwhich have been discovered in the Lias indicate an animal of\r\nfrom 20 to nearly 40 feet in length; and many species are known\r\nto have existed, whilst fragmentary remains of their skeletons\r\nare very abundant in some localities. We may therefore safely\r\nconclude that these colossal Reptiles were amongst the most\r\nformidable of the many tyrants of the Jurassic seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177.--_Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus_, restored.\r\nLias.]\r\n\r\nThe _Plesiosaurus_ (fig. 177) is another famous Oolitic Reptile,\r\nand, like the preceding, must have lived mainly or exclusively in\r\nthe sea. It agrees with the Ichthyosaur in some important features\r\nof its organisation, especially in the fact that both pairs of\r\nlimbs are converted into \"flippers\" or swimming-paddles, whilst\r\nthe skin seems to have been equally destitute of any scaly or bony\r\ninvestiture. Unlike the _Ichthyosaur_, however, the Plesiosaur\r\nhad the paddles placed far back, the tail being extremely short,\r\nand the neck greatly lengthened out, and composed of from twenty\r\nto forty vertebræ. The bodies of the vertebræ, also, are not\r\ndeeply biconcave, but are flat, or only slightly cupped. The\r\nhead is of relatively small size, with smaller orbits than those\r\nof the _Ichthyosaur_, and with a snout less elongated. The jaws,\r\nhowever, were armed with numerous conical teeth, inserted in\r\ndistinct sockets. As regards the habits of the Plesiosaur, Dr\r\nConybeare arrives at the following conclusions: \"That it was\r\naquatic is evident from the form of its paddles; that it was\r\nmarine is almost equally so from the remains with which it is\r\nuniversally associated; that it may have occasionally visited\r\nthe shore, the resemblance of its extremities to those of the\r\nTurtles may lead us to conjecture: its movements, however, must\r\nhave been very awkward on land; and its long neck must have impeded\r\nits progress through the water, presenting a strong contrast to\r\nthe organisation which so admirably fits the _Ichthyosaurus_\r\nto cut through the waves.\" As its respiratory organs were such\r\nthat it must of necessity have required to obtain air frequently,\r\nwe may conclude \"that it swam upon or near the surface, arching\r\nback its long neck like a swan, and occasionally darting it down\r\nat the fish which happened to float within its reach. It may\r\nperhaps have lurked in shoal water along the coast, concealed\r\namongst the sea-weed; and raising its nostrils to a level with\r\nthe surface from a considerable depth, may have found a secure\r\nretreat from the assaults of powerful enemies; while the length\r\nand flexibility of its neck may have compensated for the want\r\nof strength in its jaws, and its incapacity for swift-motion\r\nthrough the water.\"\r\n\r\nAbout twenty species of _Plesiosaurus_ are known, ranging from\r\nthe Lias to the Chalk, and specimens have been found indicating\r\na length of from eighteen to twenty feet. The nearly related\r\n\"_Pliosaurs_,\" however, with their huge heads and short necks,\r\nmust have occasionally reached a length of at least forty feet--the\r\nskull in some species being eight, and the paddles six or seven\r\nfeet long, whilst the teeth are a foot in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178.--_Pterodactylus crassirostis_. From the\r\nLithographic Slates of Solenhofen (Middle Oolite). The figure is\r\n\"restored,\" and it seems certain that the restoration is incorrect\r\nin the comparatively unimportant particular, that the hand should\r\nconsist of no more than four fingers, three short and one long,\r\ninstead of five, as represented.]\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary group of Jurassic Reptiles is that of the\r\n\"Winged Lizards\" or _Pterosauria_. These are often spoken of\r\ncollectively as \"Pterodactyles,\" from _Pterodactylus_, the type-genus\r\nof the group. As now restricted, however, the genus _Pterodactylus_\r\nis more Cretaceous than Jurassic, and it is associated in the\r\nOolitic rocks with the closely allied genera _Dimorphodon_ and\r\n_Rhamphorhynchus_. In all three of these genera we have the same\r\ngeneral structural organisation, involving a marvellous combination\r\nof characters, which we are in the habit of regarding as peculiar\r\nto Birds on the one hand, to Reptiles on another hand, and to the\r\nFlying Mammals or Bats in a third direction. The \"Pterosaurs\"\r\nare \"Flying\" Reptiles, in the true sense of the term, since they\r\nwere indubitably possessed of the power of active locomotion\r\nin the air, after the manner of Birds. The so-called \"Flying\"\r\nReptiles of the present day, such as the little _Draco volans_\r\nof the East Indies and Indian Archipelago, possess, on the other\r\nhand, no power of genuine flight, being merely able to sustain\r\nthemselves in the air through the extensive leaps which they take\r\nfrom tree to tree, the wing-like expansions of the skin simply\r\nexercising the mechanical function of a parachute. The apparatus\r\nof flight in the \"Pterosaurs\" is of the most remarkable character,\r\nand most resembles the \"wing\" of a Bat, though very different in\r\nsome important particulars. The \"wing\" of the Pterosaurs is like\r\nthat of Bats, namely, in consisting of a thin leathery expansion of\r\nthe skin which is attached to the sides of the body, and stretches\r\nbetween the fore and hind limbs, being mainly supported by an\r\nenormous elongation of certain of the digits of the hand. In\r\nthe Bats, it is the four outer fingers which are thus lengthened\r\nout; but in the Pterosaurs, the wing-membrane is borne by a single\r\nimmensely-extended finger (fig. 178). No trace of the actual\r\nwing-membrane itself has, of course, been found fossilised; but\r\nwe could determine that the \"Pterodactyles\" possessed the power\r\nof flight, quite apart from the extraordinary conformation of\r\nthe hand. The proofs of this are to be found partly in the fact\r\nthat the breast-bone was furnished with an elevated ridge or\r\nkeel, serving for the attachment of the great muscles of flight,\r\nand still more in the fact that the bones were hollow and were\r\nfilled with air--a peculiarity wholly confined amongst living\r\nanimals to Birds only. The skull of the Pterosaurs is long, light,\r\nand singularly bird-like in appearance--a resemblance which is\r\nfurther increased by the comparative length of the neck and the\r\nsize of the vertebræ of this region (fig. 178). The jaws, however,\r\nunlike those of any existing Bird, were, with one exception to be\r\nnoticed hereafter, furnished with conical teeth sunk in distinct\r\nsockets; and there was always a longer or shorter tail composed\r\nof distinct vertebræ; whereas in all existing Birds the tail\r\nis abbreviated, and the terminal vertebræ are amalgamated to\r\nform a single bone, which generally supports the great feathers\r\nof the tail.\r\n\r\nModern naturalists have been pretty generally agreed that the\r\n_Pterosaurs_ should be regarded as a peculiar group of the Reptiles;\r\nthough they have been and are still regarded by high authorities,\r\nlike Professor Seeley, as being really referable to the Birds, or\r\nas forming a class by themselves. The chief points which separate\r\nthem from Birds, as a class, are the character of the apparatus\r\nof flight, the entirely different structure of the fore-limb, the\r\nabsence of feathers, the composition of the tail out of distinct\r\nvertebræ, and the general presence of conical teeth sunk in distinct\r\nsockets in the jaws. The gap between the Pterosaurs and the Birds\r\nhas, however, been greatly lessened of late by the discovery\r\nof fossil animals (_Ichthyornis_ and _Hesperornis_) with the\r\nskeleton proper to Birds combined with the presence of teeth\r\nin the jaws, and by the still more recent discovery of other\r\nfossil animals (_Pteranodon_) with a Pterosaurian skeleton, but\r\nwithout teeth; whilst the undoubtedly feathered _Archoeopteryx_\r\npossessed a long tail composed of separate vertebræ. Upon the\r\nwhole, therefore, the relationships of the Pterosaurs cannot\r\nbe regarded as absolutely settled. It seems certain, however,\r\nthat they did not possess feathers--this implying that they were\r\ncold-blooded animals; and their affinities with Reptiles in this,\r\nas in other characters, are too strong to be overlooked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179--_Rhamphorhynchus Bucklandi_, restored.\r\nBath Oolite, England. (After the late Professor Phillips.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Pterosaurs_ are wholly Mesozoic, ranging from the Lias to\r\nthe Chalk inclusive; and the fine-grained Lithographic Slate of\r\nSolenhofen has proved to be singularly rich in their remains.\r\nThe genus _Pterodactylus_ itself has the jaws toothed to the\r\nextremities with equal-sized conical teeth, and its species range\r\nfrom the Middle Oolites to the Cretaceous series, in connection\r\nwith which they will be again noticed, together with the toothless\r\ngenus _Pteranodon_. The genus _Dimorphodon_ is Liassic, and is\r\ncharacterised by having the front teeth long and pointed, whilst\r\nthe hinder teeth are small and lancet-shaped. Lastly, the singular\r\ngenus _Rhamphorhynchus_, also from the Lower Oolites, is\r\ndistinguished by the fact that there are teeth present in the\r\nhinder portions of both jaws; but the front portions are toothless,\r\nand may have constituted a horny beak. Like most of the other\r\nJurassic Pterosaurs, _Rhamphorhynchus_ (fig. 179) does not seem\r\nto have been much bigger than a pigeon, in this respect falling\r\nfar below the giant \"Dragons\" of the Cretaceous period. It differed\r\nfrom its relatives, not only in the armature of the mouth, but\r\nalso in the fact that the tail was of considerable length. With\r\nregard to its habits and mode of life, Professor Phillips remarks\r\nthat, \"gifted with ample means of flight, able at least to perch\r\non rocks and scuffle along the shore, perhaps competent to dive,\r\nthough not so well as a Palmiped bird, many fishes must have\r\nyielded to the cruel beak and sharp teeth of Rhamphorhynchus.\r\nIf we ask to which of the many families of Birds the analogy of\r\nstructure and probable way of life would lead us to assimilate\r\nRhamphorhynchus, the answer must point to the swimming races with\r\nlong wings, clawed feet, hooked beak, and habits or violence and\r\nvoracity; and for preference, the shortness of the legs, and other\r\ncircumstances, may be held to claim for the Stonesfield fossil a\r\nmore than fanciful similitude to the groups of Cormorants, and\r\nother marine divers, which constitute an effective part of the\r\npicturesque army of robbers of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary and interesting group of the Mesozoic Reptiles\r\nis constituted by the _Deinosauria_, comprising a series of mostly\r\ngigantic forms, which range from the Trias to the Chalk. All the\r\n\"Deinosaurs\" are possessed of the two pairs of limbs proper to\r\nVertebrate animals, and these organs are in the main adapted for\r\nwalking on the dry land. Thus, whilst the Mesozoic seas swarmed\r\nwith the huge Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs, and whilst the air\r\nwas tenanted by the Dragon-like Pterosaurs, the land-surfaces of\r\nthe Secondary period were peopled by numerous forms of Deinosaurs,\r\nsome of them of even more gigantic dimensions than their marine\r\nbrethren. The limbs of the _Deinosaurs_ are, as just said, adapted\r\nfor progression on the land; but in some cases, at any rate, the\r\nhind-limbs were much longer and stronger than the fore-limbs;\r\nand there seems to be no reason to doubt that many of these forms\r\npossessed the power of walking, temporarily or permanently, on their\r\nhind-legs, thus presenting a singular resemblance to Birds. Some\r\nvery curious and striking points connected with the structure of\r\nthe skeleton have also been shown to connect these strange Reptiles\r\nwith the true Birds; and such high authorities as Professors Huxley\r\nand Cope are of opinion that the Deinosaurs are distinctly related\r\nto this class, being in some respects intermediate between the\r\nproper Reptiles and the great wingless Birds, like the Ostrich\r\nand Cassowary. On the other hand, Professor Owen has shown that the\r\nDeinosaurs possess some weighty points of relationship with the\r\nso-called \"Pachydermatous\" Quadrupeds, such as the Rhinoceros and\r\nHippopotamus. The most important Jurassic genera of _Deinosauria_\r\nare _Megalosaurus_ and _Cetiosaurus_, both of which extend their\r\nrange into the Cretaceous period, in which flourished, as we\r\nshall see, some other well-known members of this order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180.--Skull of _Megalosaurus_, on a scale\r\none-tenth of nature. Restored. (After Professor Phillips.)]\r\n\r\n_Megalosaurus_ attained gigantic dimensions, its thigh and shank\r\nbones measuring each about three feet in length, and its total\r\nlength, including the tail, being estimated at from forty to\r\nfifty feet. As the head of the thigh-bone is set on nearly at\r\nright angles with the shaft, whilst all the long bones of the\r\nskeleton are hollowed out internally for the reception of the\r\nmarrow, there can be no doubt as to the terrestrial habits of\r\nthe animal. The skull (fig. 180) was of large size, four or five\r\nfeet in length, and the jaws were armed with a series of powerful\r\npointed teeth. The teeth are conical in shape, but are strongly\r\ncompressed towards their summits, their lateral edges being finely\r\nserrated. In their form and their saw-like edges, they resemble\r\nthe teeth of the \"Sabre-toothed Tiger\" (_Machairodus_), and they\r\nrender it certain that the Megalosaur was in the highest degree\r\ndestructive and carnivorous in its habits. So far as is known, the\r\nskin was not furnished with any armour of scales or bony plates;\r\nand the fore-limbs are so disproportionately small as compared\r\nwith the hind-limbs, that this huge Reptile--like the equally\r\nhuge Iguanodon--may be conjectured to have commonly supported\r\nitself on its hind-legs only.\r\n\r\nThe _Cetiosaur_ attained dimensions even greater than those of\r\nthe Megalosaur, one of the largest thigh-bones measuring over\r\nfive feet in length and a foot in diameter in the middle, and\r\nthe total length of the animal being probably not less than fifty\r\nfeet. It was originally regarded as a gigantic Crocodile, but\r\nit has been shown to be a true Deinosaur. Having obtained a\r\nmagnificent series of remains of this reptile, Professor Phillips\r\nhas been able to determine many very interesting points as to\r\nthe anatomy and habits of this colossal animal, the total length\r\nof which he estimates as being probably not less than sixty or\r\nseventy feet. As to its mode of life, this accomplished writer\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n\"Probably when 'standing at ease' not less than ten feet in height,\r\nand of a bulk in proportion, this creature was unmatched in magnitude\r\nand physical strength by any of the largest inhabitants of the\r\nMesozoic land or sea. Did it live in the sea, in fresh waters,\r\nor on the land? This question cannot be answered, as in the case\r\nof Ichthyosaurus, by appeal to the accompanying organic remains;\r\nfor some of the bones lie in marine deposits, others in situations\r\nmarked by estuarine conditions, and, out of the Oxfordshire district,\r\nin Sussex, in fluviatile accumulations. Was it fitted to live\r\nexclusively in water? Such an idea was at one time entertained,\r\nin consequence of the biconcave character of the caudal vertebræ,\r\nand it is often suggested by the mere magnitude of the creature,\r\nwhich would seem to have an easier life while floating in water,\r\nthan when painfully lifting its huge bulk, and moving with slow\r\nsteps along the ground. But neither of these arguments is valid. The\r\nancient earth was trodden by larger quadrupeds than our elephant;\r\nand the biconcave character of vertebræ, which is not uniform\r\nalong the column in Cetiosaurus, is perhaps as much a character\r\nof a geological period as of a mechanical function of life. Good\r\nevidence of continual life in water is yielded in the case of\r\nIchthyosaurus and other Enaliosaurs, by the articulating surfaces\r\nof their limb-bones, for these, all of them, to the last phalanx,\r\nhave that slight and indefinite adjustment of the bones, with much\r\nintervening cartilage, which fits the leg to be both a flexible\r\nand forcible instrument of natation, much superior to the ordinary\r\noar-blade of the boatman. On the contrary, in Cetiosaur, as well as\r\nin Megalosaur and Iguanodon, all the articulations are definite,\r\nand made so as to correspond to determinate movements in particular\r\ndirections, and these are such as to be suited for walking. In\r\nparticular, the femur, by its head projecting freely from the\r\nacetabulum, seems to claim a movement of free stepping more parallel\r\nto the line of the body, and more approaching to the vertical than\r\nthe sprawling gait of the crocodile. The large claws concur in this\r\nindication of terrestrial habits. But, on the other hand, these\r\ncharacters are not contrary to the belief that the animal may have\r\nbeen amphibious; and the great vertical height of the anterior\r\npart of the tail seems to support this explanation, but it does\r\nnot go further.... We have therefore a marsh-loving or river-side\r\nanimal, dwelling amidst filicine, cycadaceous, and coniferous\r\nshrubs and trees full of insects and small mammalia. What was\r\nits usual diet? If _ex ungue leonem_, surely _ex dente cibum_.\r\nWe have indeed but one tooth, and that small and incomplete. It\r\nresembles more the tooth of Iguanodon than that of any other\r\nreptile; for this reason it seems probable that the animal was\r\nnourished by similar vegetable food which abounded in the vicinity,\r\nand was not obliged to contend with Megalosaurus for a scanty\r\nsupply of more stimulating diet.\"\r\n\r\nAll the groups of Jurassic Reptiles which we have hitherto been\r\nconsidering are wholly unrepresented at the present day, and\r\ndo not even pass upwards into the Tertiary period. It may be\r\nmentioned, however, that the Oolitic deposits have also yielded\r\nthe remains of Reptiles belonging to three of the existing orders\r\nof the class-namely, the Lizards (_Lacertilia_), the Turtles\r\n(_Chelonia_), and the Crocodiles (_Crocodilia_). The Lizards\r\noccur both in the marine strata of the Middle Oolites and also\r\nin the fresh-water beds of the Purbeck series; and they are of\r\nsuch a nature that their affinities with the typical Lacertilians\r\nof the present day cannot be disputed. The Chelonians, up to\r\nthis point only known by the doubtful evidence of footprints\r\nin the Permian and Triassic sandstones, are here represented by\r\nunquestionable remains, indicating the existence of marine Turtles\r\n(the _Chelone planiceps_ of the Portland Stone). No remains of\r\nSerpents (_Ophidians_) have as yet been detected in the Jurassic;\r\nbut strata of this age have yielded the remains of numerous\r\n_Crocodilians_, which probably inhabited the sea. The most important\r\nmember of this group is _Teleosaurus_, which attained a length of\r\nover thirty feet, and is in some respects allied to the living\r\nGavials of India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181.--_Archoeopteryx macrura_, showing tail\r\nand tail-feathers, with detached bones. Reduced. From the\r\nLithographic Slate of Solenhofen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182.--Restoration of _Archoeopteryx macrura_.\r\n(After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nThe great class of the Birds, as we have seen, is represented\r\nin rocks earlier than the Oolites simply by the not absolutely\r\ncertain evidence of the three-toed footprints of the Connecticut\r\nTrias. In the Lithographic Slate of Solenhofen (Middle Oolite),\r\nthere has been discovered, however, the at present unique skeleton\r\nof a Bird well known under the name of the _Archoeopteryx macrura_\r\n(figs. 181, 182). The only known specimen--now in the British\r\nMuseum--unfortunately does not exhibit the skull; but the\r\nfine-grained matrix has preserved a number of the other bones\r\nof the skeleton, along with the impressions of the tail and wing\r\nfeathers. From these remains we know that _Archoeopteryx_ differed\r\nin some remarkable peculiarities of its structure from all existing\r\nmembers of the class of Birds. This extraordinary Bird (fig.\r\n182) appears to have been about as big as a Rook--the tail being\r\nlong and extremely slender, and composed of separate vertebræ,\r\neach of which supports a single pair of quill-feathers. In the\r\nflying Birds of the present day, as before mentioned, the terminal\r\nvertebræ of the tail are amalgamated to form a single bone\r\n(\"ploughshare-bone\"), which supports a cluster of tail-feathers;\r\nand the tail itself is short. In the embryos of existing Birds\r\nthe tail is long, and is made up of separate vertebræ, and the\r\nsame character is observed in many existing Reptiles. The tail\r\nof _Archoeopteryx_, therefore, is to be regarded as the permanent\r\nretention of an embryonic type of structure, or as an approximation\r\nto the characters of the Reptiles. Another remarkable point in\r\nconnection with _Archoeopteryx_, in which it differs from all\r\nknown Birds, is, that the wing was furnished with two free claws.\r\nFrom the presence of feathers, _Archoeopteryx_ may be inferred to\r\nhave been hot-blooded; and this character, taken along with the\r\nstructure of the skeleton of the wing, may be held as sufficient\r\nto justify its being considered as belonging to the class of\r\nBirds. In the structure of the tail, however, it is singularly\r\nReptilian; and there is reason to believe that its jaws were\r\nfurnished with teeth sunk in distinct sockets, as is the case\r\nin no existing Bird. This conclusion, at any rate, is rendered\r\nhighly probable by the recent discovery of \"Toothed Birds\"\r\n(_Odonturnithes_) in the Cretaceous rocks of North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183.--Lower jaw of _Amphitherium_\r\n(_Thylacotherium_) _Prevostii_. Stonesfield Slate (Great Oolite.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184. Oolitic Mammals.--1, Lower jaw and teeth\r\nof _Phascolotherium_, Stonesfield Slate; 2, Lower jaw and teeth\r\nof _Amphitherium_, Stonesfield Slate; 3, Lower jaw and teeth of\r\n_Triconodon_, Purbeck beds; 4, Lower jaw and teeth of _Plagiaulax_,\r\nPurbeck beds. All the figures are of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mammals_ of the Jurassic period are known to us by a number\r\nof small forms which occur in the \"Stonesfield Slate\" (Great\r\nOolite) and in the Purbeck beds (Upper Oolite). The remains of\r\nthese are almost exclusively separated halves of the lower jaw,\r\nand they indicate the existence during the Oolitic period in\r\nEurope of a number of small \"Pouched animals\" (_Marsupials_).\r\nIn the horizon of the Stonesfield Slate four genera of these\r\nlittle Quadrupeds have been described--viz., _Amphilestes,\r\nAmphitherium, Phascolotherium_, and _Stereognathus_. In\r\n_Amphitherium_ (fig. 183), the molar teeth are furnished with\r\nsmall pointed eminences or \"cusps;\" and the animal was doubtless\r\ninsectivorous. By Professor Owen, the highest living authority on\r\nthe subject, _Amphitherium_ is believed to be a small Marsupial,\r\nmost nearly allied to the living Banded Ant-eater (_Myrmecobius_)\r\nof Australia (fig. 158). _Amphilestes_ and _Phascolotherium_\r\n(fig. 184) are also believed by the same distinguished anatomist\r\nand palæontologist to have been insect-eating Marsupials, and\r\nthe latter is supposed to find its nearest living ally in the\r\nOpossums (_Didelphys_) of America. Lastly, the _Stereognathus_ of\r\nthe Stonesfield Slate is in a dubious position. It may have been\r\na Marsupial; but, upon the whole, Professor Owen is inclined to\r\nbelieve that it must have been a hoofed and herbivorous Quadruped\r\nbelonging to the series of the higher Mammals (_Placentalia_).\r\nIn the Middle Purbeck beds, near to the close of the Oolitic\r\nperiod, we have also evidence of the existence of a number of\r\nsmall Mammals, all of which are probably Marsupials. Fourteen\r\nspecies are known, all of small size, the largest being no bigger\r\nthan a Polecat or Hedgehog. The genera to which these little\r\nquadrupeds have been referred are _Plagiaulax, Spalacotherium,\r\nTriconodon_, and _Galestes_. The first of these (fig. 184, 4)\r\nis believed by Professor Owen to have been carnivorous in its\r\nhabits; but other authorities maintain that it was most nearly\r\nallied to the living Kangaroo-rats (_Hypsiprymnus_) of Australia,\r\nand that it was essentially herbivorous. The remaining three\r\ngenera appear to have been certainly insectivorous, and find\r\ntheir nearest living representatives in the Australian Phalangers\r\nand the American Opossums.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is interesting to notice in how many respects the\r\nJurassic fauna of Western Europe approached to that now inhabiting\r\nAustralia. At the present day, Australia is almost wholly tenanted\r\nby Marsupials; upon its land-surface flourish _Araucarioe_ and\r\nCycadaceous plants, and in its seas swims the Port-Jackson Shark\r\n(_Cestracion Philippi_); whilst the Molluscan genus _Trigonia_\r\nis nowadays exclusively confined to the Australian coasts. In\r\nEngland, at the time of the deposition of the Jurassic rocks,\r\nwe must have had a fauna and flora very closely resembling what\r\nwe now see in Australia. The small Marsupials, _Amphitherium,\r\nPhascolotherium_, and others, prove that the Mammals were the same\r\nin order; cones of Araucarian pines, with tree-ferns and fronds\r\nof Cycads, occur throughout the Oolitic series; spine-bearing\r\nfishes, like the Port-Jackson Shark, are abundantly represented\r\nby genera such as _Acrodus_ and _Strophodus_; and lastly, the\r\ngenus _Trigonia_, now exclusively Australian, is represented\r\nin the Oolites by species which differ little from those now\r\nexisting. Moreover, the discovery during recent years of the\r\nsingular Mud-fish, the _Ceratodus Fosteri_ in the rivers of\r\nQueensland, has added another and a very striking point of\r\nresemblance to those already mentioned; since this genus of Fishes,\r\nthough preeminently Triassic, nevertheless extended its range\r\ninto the Jurassic. Upon the whole, therefore, there is reason\r\nto conclude that Australia has undergone since the close of the\r\nJurassic period fewer changes and vicissitudes than any other\r\nknown region of the globe; and that this wonderful continent\r\nhas therefore succeeded in preserving a greater number of the\r\ncharacteristic life-features of the Oolites than any other country\r\nwith which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following list comprises some of the more important sources of\r\ninformation as to the rocks and fossils of the Jurassic series:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Geology of Oxford and the Thames Valley.'

Wealden,                       \\_ Lower Cretaceous.\r\n  2. Lower Greensand or Neocomian,  /\r\n  3. Gault,                         \\\r\n  4. Upper Greensand,               |_ Upper Cretaceous.\r\n  5. Chalk,                         |\r\n  6. Maestricht beds,               /\r\n\r\nI. _Wealden_.--The _Wealden_ formation, though of considerable\r\nimportance, is a local group, and is confined to the southeast\r\nof England, France, and some other parts of Europe. Its name is\r\nderived from the _Weald_, a district comprising parts of Surrey,\r\nSussex, and Kent, where it is largely developed. Its lower portion,\r\nfor a thickness of from 500 to 1000 feet, is arenaceous, and is\r\nknown as the Hastings Sands. Its Upper portion, for a thickness\r\nof 150 to nearly 300 feet, is chiefly argillaceous, consisting of\r\nclays with sandy layers, and occasionally courses of limestone.\r\nThe geological importance of the Wealden formation is very great,\r\nas it is undoubtedly the delta of an ancient river, being composed\r\nalmost wholly of fresh-water beds, with a few brackish-water\r\nand even marine strata, intercalated in the lower portion. Its\r\ngeographical extent, though uncertain, owing to the enormous\r\ndenudation to which it has been subjected, is nevertheless great,\r\nsince it extends from Dorsetshire to France, and occurs also in\r\nNorth Germany. Still, even if it were continuous between all\r\nthese points, it would not be larger than the delta of such a\r\nmodern river as the Ganges. The river which produced the Wealden\r\nseries must have flowed from an ancient continent occupying what\r\nis now the Atlantic Ocean; and the time occupied in the formation\r\nof the Wealden must have been very great, though we have, of\r\ncourse, no data by which we can accurately calculate its duration.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the Wealden series are, naturally, mostly the\r\nremains of such animals as we know at the present day as inhabiting\r\nrivers. We have, namely, fresh-water Mussels (_Unio_), River-snails\r\n(_Paludina_), and other fresh-water shells, with numerous little\r\nbivalved Crustaceans, and some fishes.\r\n\r\nII. _Lower Greensand_ (_Néocomien_ of D'Orbigny).--The Wealden\r\nbeds pass upward, often by insensible gradations, into the Lower\r\nGreensand. The name Lower Greensand is not an appropriate one,\r\nfor green sands only occur sparingly and occasionally, and are\r\nfound in other formations. For this reason it has been proposed\r\nto substitute for Lower Greensand the name _Neocomian_, derived\r\nfrom the town of Neufchâtel--anciently called _Neocomum_--in\r\nSwitzerland. If this name were adopted, as it ought to be, the\r\nWealden beds would be called the Lower Neocomian.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand or Neocomian of Britain has a thickness of\r\nabout 850 feet, and consists of alternations of sands, sandstones,\r\nand clays, with occasional calcareous bands. The general colour\r\nof the series is dark brown, sometimes red; and the sands are\r\noccasionally green, from the presence of silicate of iron.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the Lower Greensand are purely marine, and among\r\nthe most characteristic are the shells of _Cephalopods_.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable point, however, about the fossils of the\r\nLower Cretaceous series, is their marked divergence from the\r\nfossils of the Upper Cretaceous rocks. Of 280 species of fossils\r\nin the Lower Cretaceous series, only 51, or about 18 per cent, pass\r\non into the Upper Cretaceous. This break in the life of the two\r\nperiods is accompanied by a decided physical break as well; for the\r\nGault is often, if not always, unconformably superimposed on the\r\nLower Greensand. At the same time, the Lower and Upper Cretaceous\r\ngroups form a closely-connected and inseparable series, as shown\r\nby a comparison of their fossils with those of the underlying\r\nJurassic rocks and the overlying Tertiary beds. Thus, in Britain\r\nno marine fossil is known to be common to the marine beds of\r\nthe Upper Oolites and the Lower Greensand; and of more than 500\r\nspecies of fossils in the Upper Cretaceous rocks, almost everyone\r\ndied out before the formation of the lowest Tertiary strata, the\r\nonly survivors being one Brachiopod and a few _Foraminifera_.\r\n\r\nIII. _Gault_ (_Aptien_ of D'Orbigny).--The lowest member of the\r\nUpper Cretaceous series is a stiff, dark-grey, blue, or brown\r\nclay, often worked for brick-making, and known as the _Gault_,\r\nfrom a provincial English term. It occurs chiefly in the south-east\r\nof England, but can be traced through France to the flanks of\r\nthe Alps and Bavaria. It never exceeds 100 feet in thickness;\r\nbut it contains many fossils, usually in a state of beautiful\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nIV. _Upper Greensand_ (_Albien_ of D'Orbigny; _Unterquader_ and\r\n_Lower Plänerkalk_ of Germany).--The Gault is succeeded upward by\r\nthe _Upper Greensand_, which varies in thickness from 3 up to 100\r\nfeet, and which derives its name from the occasional occurrence\r\nin it of green sands. These, however, are local and sometimes\r\nwanting, and the name \"Upper Greensand\" is to be regarded as a\r\n_name_ and not a description. The group consists, in Britain,\r\nof sands and clays, sometimes with bands of calcareous grit or\r\nsiliceous limestone, and occasionally containing concretions of\r\nphosphate of lime, which are largely worked for agricultural\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nV. _White Chalk_.--The top of the Upper Greensand becomes\r\nargillaceous, and passes up gradually into the base of the great\r\nformation known as the true _Chalk_, divided into the three\r\nsubdivisions of the chalk-marl, white chalk without flints, and\r\nwhite chalk with flints. The first of these is simply argillaceous\r\nchalk, and passes up into a great mass of obscurely-stratified\r\nwhite chalk in which there are no flints (_Turonien_ of D'Orbigny;\r\n_Mittelquader_ of Germany). This, in turn, passes up into a great\r\nmass of white chalk, in which the stratification is marked by\r\nnodules of black flint arranged in layers (_Sénonien_ of D'Orbigny;\r\n_Oberquader_ of Germany). The thickness of these three subdivisions\r\ntaken together is sometimes over 1000 feet, and their geographical\r\nextent is very great. White Chalk, with its characteristic\r\nappearance, may be traced from the north of Ireland to the Crimea,\r\na distance of about 1140 geographical miles; and, in an opposite\r\ndirection, from the south of Sweden to Bordeaux, a distance of\r\nabout 840 geographical miles.\r\n\r\nVI. In Britain there occur no beds containing Chalk fossils, or\r\nin any way referable to the Cretaceous period, above the true\r\nWhite Chalk with flints. On the banks of the Maes, however, near\r\nMaestricht in Holland, there occurs a series of yellowish limestones,\r\nof about 100 feet in thickness, and undoubtedly superior to the White\r\nChalk. These _Maestricht beds_ (_Danien_ of D'Orbigny) contain a\r\nremarkable series of fossils, the characters of which are partly\r\nCretaceous and partly Tertiary. Thus, with the characteristic\r\nChalk fossils, _Belemnites, Baculites_, Sea-Urchins, &c., are\r\nnumerous Univalve Molluscs, such as Cowries and Volutes, which\r\nare otherwise exclusively Tertiary or Recent.\r\n\r\nHolding a similar position to the Maestricht beds, and showing\r\na similar intermixture of Cretaceous forms with later types, are\r\ncertain beds which occur in the island of Seeland, in Denmark,\r\nand which are known as the _Faxöe Limestone_.\r\n\r\nOf a somewhat later date than the Maestricht beds is the _Pisolitic\r\nLimestone_ of France, which rests unconformably on the White\r\nChalk, and contains a large number of Tertiary fossils along with\r\nsome characteristic Cretaceous types.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined sketch-section exhibits the general succession of\r\nthe Cretaceous deposits in Britain:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. GENERALIZED SECTION OF THE CRETACEOUS\r\nSERIES OF BRITAIN.]\r\n\r\nIn North America, strata of Lower Cretaceous age are well represented\r\nin Missouri, Wyoming, Utah, and in some other areas; but the greater\r\nportion of the American deposits of this period are referable to\r\nthe Upper Cretaceous. The rocks of this series are mostly sands,\r\nclays, and limestones--_Chalk_ itself being unknown except in\r\nWestern Arkansas. Amongst the sandy accumulations, one of the\r\nmost important is the so-called \"marl\" of New Jersey, which is\r\ntruly a \"Greensand,\" and contains a large proportion of glauconite\r\n(silicate of iron and potash). It also contains a little phosphate\r\nof lime, and is largely worked for agricultural purposes. The\r\ngreatest thickness attained by the Cretaceous rocks of North\r\nAmerica is about 9000 feet, as in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado.\r\nAccording to Dana, the Cretaceous rocks of the Rocky Mountain\r\nterritories pass upwards \"without interruption into a coal-bearing\r\nformation, several thousand feet thick, on which the following\r\nTertiary strata lie unconformably.\" The lower portion of this\r\n\"Lignitic formation\" appears to be Cretaceous, and contains one\r\nor more beds of Coal; but the upper part of it perhaps belongs\r\nto the Lower Tertiary. In America, therefore, the lowest Tertiary\r\nstrata appear to rest conformably upon the highest Cretaceous;\r\nwhereas in Europe, the succession at this point is invariably an\r\nunconformable one. Owing, however, to the fact that the American\r\n\"Lignitic formation\" is a shallow-water formation, it can hardly\r\nbe expected to yield much material whereby to bridge over the\r\ngreat palæontological gap between the White Chalk and Eocene\r\nin the Old World.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that so large a portion of the Cretaceous formation\r\nhas been deposited in the sea, much of it in deep water, the _plants_\r\nof the period have for the most part been found special members\r\nof the series, such as the Wealden beds, the Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nsands, and the Lignitic beds of North America. Even the purely\r\nmarine strata, however, have yielded plant-remains, and some of\r\nthese are peculiar and proper to the deep-sea deposits of the\r\nseries. Thus the little calcareous discs termed \"coccoliths,\" which\r\nare known to be of the nature of calcareous sea-weeds (_Algoe_)\r\nhave been detected in the White Chalk; and the flints of the same\r\nformation commonly contain the spore-cases of the microscopic\r\n_Desmids_ (the so-called Xanthidia), along with the siliceous\r\ncases of the equally diminutive _Diatoms_.\r\n\r\nThe plant-remains of the Lower Cretaceous greatly resemble those\r\nof the Jurassic period, consisting mainly of Ferns, Cycads, and\r\nConifers. The Upper Cretaceous rocks, however, both in Europe and\r\nin North America, have yielded an abundant flora which resembles\r\nthe existing vegetation of the globe in consisting mainly of\r\nAngiospermous Exogens and of Monocotyledons.[23] In Europe the\r\nplant-remains in question have been found chiefly in certain\r\nsands in the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle, and they consist\r\nof numerous Ferns, Conifers (such as _Cycadopteris_), Screw Pines\r\n(_Pandanus_), Oaks (_Quercus_), Walnut (_Juglans_), Fig (_Ficus_),\r\nand many _Proteaceoe_, some of which are referred to existing\r\ngenera (_Dryandra, Banksia, Grevillea_, &c.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The \"Flowering plants\" are divided into the two\r\ngreat groups of the Endogens and Exogens. The _Endogens_ (such\r\nas Grasses, Palms, Lilies, &c.) have no true bark, nor rings of\r\ngrowth, and the stem is said to be \"endogenous;\" the young plant\r\nalso possesses but a single seed-leaf or \"cotyledon.\" Hence these\r\nplants are often simply called \"_Monocotyledons_.\" The _Exogens_,\r\non the other hand, have a true bark; and the stem increases by\r\nannual additions to the outside, so that rings of growth are\r\nproduced. The young plant has two seed-leaves or \"cotyledons,\"\r\nand these plants are therefore called \"_Dicotyledons_.\" Amongst the\r\nExogens, the Pines (_Conifers_) and the Cycads have seeds which\r\nare unprotected by a seed-vessel, and they are therefore called\r\n\"_Gymnosperms_.\" All the other Exogens, including the ordinary\r\ntrees, shrubs, and flowering plants, have the seeds enclosed in\r\na seed-vessel, and are therefore called \"_Angiosperms_.\" The\r\nderivation of these terms will be found in the Glossary at the\r\nend of the volume.]\r\n\r\nIn North America, the Cretaceous strata of New Jersey, Alabama,\r\nNebraska, Kansas, &c., have yielded the remains of numerous plants,\r\nmany of which belong to existing genera. Amongst these may be\r\nmentioned Tulip-trees (_Liriodendron_), Sassafras (fig. 186),\r\nOaks (_Quercus_), Beeches (_Fagus_), Plane-trees (_Platanus_),\r\nAlders (_Alnus_), Dog-wood (_Cornus_), Willows (_Salix_), Poplars\r\n(_Populus_), Cypresses (_Cupressus_), Bald Cypresses (_Taxodium_),\r\nMagnolias, &c. Besides these, however, there occur other forms\r\nwhich have now entirely disappeared from North America--as, for\r\nexample, species of _Cinnamomum_ and _Araucaria_.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the above, that the Lower and Upper Cretaceous\r\nrocks are, from a botanical point of view, sharply separated\r\nfrom one another. The Palæozoic period, as we have seen, is\r\ncharacterised by the prevalance of \"Flowerless\" plants\r\n(_Cryptogams_), its higher vegetation consisting almost exclusively\r\nof Conifers. The Mesozoic period, as a whole, is characterised\r\nby the prevalence of the Cryptogamic group of the Ferns, and\r\nthe Gymnospermic groups of the Conifers and the Cycads. Up to\r\nthe close of the Lower Cretaceous, no Angiospermous Exogens are\r\ncertainly known to have existed, and Monocotyledonous plants or\r\nEndogens are very poorly represented. With the Upper Cretaceous,\r\nhowever, a new era of plant-life, of which our present is but\r\nthe culmination, commenced, with a great and apparently sudden\r\ndevelopment of new forms. In place of the Ferns, Cycads, and\r\nConifers of the earlier Mesozoic deposits, we have now an\r\nastonishingly large number of true Angiospermous Exogens, many\r\nof them belonging to existing types; and along with these are\r\nvarious Monocotyledonous plants, including the first examples of\r\nthe great and important group of the Palms. It is thus a matter\r\nof interest to reflect that plants closely related to those now\r\ninhabiting the earth, were in existence at a time when the ocean\r\nwas tenanted by Ammonites and Belemnites, and when land and sea\r\nand air were peopled by the extraordinary extinct Reptiles of\r\nthe Mesozoic period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186.--Cretaceous Angiosperms. a. _Sassafras\r\nCretaceum; b, Liriodendron Meekii; c, Leguminosites Marcouanus;\r\nd, Salix Meekii_. (After Dana.)]\r\n\r\nAs regards animal life, the _Protozoans_ of the Cretaceous period\r\nare exceedingly numerous, and are represented by _Foraminifera_\r\nand _Sponges_. As we have already seen, the White Chalk itself is\r\na deep-sea deposit, almost entirely composed of the microscopic\r\nshells of _Foraminifers_, along with Sponge-spicules, and organic\r\n_débris_ of different kinds (see fig. 7). The green grains which\r\nare so abundant in several minor subdivisions of the Cretaceous,\r\nare also in many instances really casts in glauconite of the\r\nchambered shells of these minute organisms. A great many species\r\nof _Foraminifera_ have been recognised in the Chalk; but the\r\nthree principal genera are _Globigerina, Rotalia_ (fig. 187),\r\nand _Textularia_--groups which are likewise characteristic of\r\nthe \"ooze\" of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at great depths.\r\nThe flints of the Chalk also commonly contain the shells of\r\n_Foraminifera_. The Upper Greensand has yielded in considerable\r\nnumbers the huge _Foraminifera_ described by Dr Carpenter under\r\nthe name of _Parkeria_, the spherical shells of which are composed\r\nof sand-grains agglutinated together, and sometimes attain a\r\ndiameter of two and a quarter inches. The Cretaceous Sponges are\r\nextremely numerous, and occur under a great number of varieties\r\nof shape and structure; but the two most characteristic genera\r\nare _Siphonia_ and _Ventriculites_, both of which are exclusively\r\nconfined to strata of this age. The _Siphonioe_ (fig. 188) consist\r\nof a pear-shaped, sometimes lobed head, supported by a longer\r\nor shorter stern, which breaks up at its base into a number of\r\nroot-like processes of attachment. The water gained access to the\r\ninterior of the Sponge by a number of minute openings covering\r\nthe surface, and ultimately escaped by a single, large,\r\nchimney-shaped aperture at the summit. In some respects these\r\nsponges present a singular resemblance to the beautiful \"Vitreous\r\nSponges\" (_Holtenia_ or _Pheronema_) of the deep Atlantic; and,\r\nlike these, they were probably denizens of a deep sea, The\r\n_Ventriculites_ of the Chalk (fig. 189) is, however, a genus\r\nstill more closely allied to the wonderful flinty Sponges, which\r\nhave been shown, by the researches of the Porcupine, Lightning,\r\nand Challenger expeditions, to live half buried in the Calcareous\r\nooze of the abysses of our great oceans. Many forms of this genus\r\nare known, having \"usually the form of graceful vases, tubes, or\r\nfunnels, variously ridged or grooved, or otherwise ornamented\r\non the surface, frequently expanded above into a cup-like lip,\r\nand continued below into a bundle of fibrous roots. The minute\r\nstructure of these bodies shows an extremely delicate tracery\r\nof fine tubes, sometimes empty, sometimes filled with loose\r\ncalcareous matter dyed with peroxide of iron.\"--(Sir Wyville\r\nThomson.) Many of the Chalk sponges, originally calcareous, have\r\nbeen converted into flint subsequently; but the Ventriculites\r\nare really composed of this substance, and are therefore genuine\r\n\"Siliceous Sponges,\" like the existing Venus's Flower-Basket\r\n(_Euplectella_). Like the latter, the skeleton was doubtless\r\noriginally composed, in the young state, of disconnected six-rayed\r\nspicules, which ultimately become fixed together to constitute\r\na continuous frame-work. The sea-water, as in the recent forms,\r\nmust have been admitted to the interior of the Sponge by numerous\r\napertures on its exterior, subsequently escaping by a single\r\nlarge opening at its summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187--_Kotalia Boueana_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188.--_Siphonia ficus. Upper Greensand. Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189.--_Ventriculites simplex_. White Chalk.\r\nBritain.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Coelenterates_, the \"Hydroid Zoophytes\" are represented\r\nby a species of the encrusting genus _Hydractinia_, the horny\r\npolypary of which is so commonly found at the present day adhering\r\nto the exterior of shells. The occurrence of this genus is of\r\ninterest, because it is the first known instance in the entire\r\ngeological series of the occurrence of an unquestionable Hydroid of\r\na modern type, though many of the existing forms of these animals\r\npossess structures which are perfectly fitted for preservation in\r\nthe fossil condition. The corals of the Cretaceous series are not\r\nvery numerous, and for the most part are referable to types such\r\nas _Trochocyathus, Stephanophyllia, Parasmilia, Synhelia_ (fig.\r\n190), &c., which belong to the same great group of corals as the\r\nmajority of existing forms. We have also a few \"Tabulate Corals\"\r\n(_Polytremacis_), hardly, if at all, generically separable from very\r\nancient forms (_Heliolites_); and the Lower Greensand has yielded\r\nthe remains of the little _Holocystis elegans_, long believed to\r\nbe the last of the great Palæozoic group of the _Rugosa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190.--_Synhelia Sharpeana_. Chalk, England.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the _Echinoderms_, the group of the _Crinoids_ now\r\nexhibits a marked decrease in the number and variety of its types.\r\nThe \"stalked\" forms are represented by _Pentacrinus_ and\r\n_Bourgueticrinus_, and the free forms by Feather-stars like our\r\nexisting _Comatuloe_; whilst a link between the stalked and free\r\ngroups is constituted by the curious \"Tortoise Encrinite\r\n(_Marsupites_). By far the most abundant Cretaceous Echinoderms,\r\nhowever, are Sea-urchins (_Echinoids_); though several Star-fishes\r\nare known as well. The remains of Sea-urchins are so abundant\r\nin various parts of the Cretaceous series, especially in the\r\nWhite Chalk, and are often so beautifully preserved, that they\r\nconstitute one of the most marked features of the fauna of the\r\nperiod. From the many genera of Sea-urchins which occur in strata\r\nof this age, it is difficult to select characteristic types;\r\nbut the genera _Galerites_ (fig. 191), _Discoidea_ (fig. 192),\r\n_Micraster, Ananchytes, Diadema, Salenia_, and _Cidaris_, may\r\nbe mentioned as being all important Cretaceous groups.\r\n\r\nComing to the _Annulose Animals_ of the Cretaceous period, there\r\nis little special to remark. The _Crustaceans_ belong for the\r\nmost part to the highly-organised groups of the Lobsters and the\r\nCrabs (the Macrurous and Brachyurous Decapods); but there are\r\nalso numerous little _Ostracodes_, especially in the fresh-water\r\nstrata of the Wealden. It should further be noted that there\r\noccurs here a great development of the singular _Crustaceous_\r\nfamily of the Barnacles (_Lepadidoe_), whilst the allied family\r\nof the equally singular Acorn-shells (_Balanidoe_) is feebly\r\nrepresented as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191.--_Galerites albogalerus_, viewed from\r\nbelow, from the side, and from above. White Chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192.--_Discoidea cylindrica_; under, side,\r\nand upper aspect. Upper Greensand.]\r\n\r\nPassing on to the _Mollusca_, the class of the Sea-mats and\r\nSea-mosses (_Polyzoa_) is immensely developed in the Cretaceous\r\nperiod, nearly two hundred species being known to occur in the\r\nChalk. Most of the Cretaceous forms belong to the family of the\r\n_Escharidoe_, the genera _Eschara_ and _Escharina_ (fig. 193)\r\nbeing particularly well represented. Most of the Cretaceous\r\n_Polyzoans_ are of small size, but some attain considerable\r\ndimensions, and many simulate Corals in their general form and\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe Lamp-shells (_Brachiopods_) have now reached a further stage\r\nof the progressive decline, which they have been undergoing ever\r\nsince the close of the Palæozoic period. Though individually not\r\nrare, especially in certain minor subdivisions of the series,\r\nthe number of generic types has now become distinctly diminished,\r\nthe principal forms belonging to the genera _Terebratula,\r\nTerebratella_ (fig. 194), _Terebratulina, Rhynchonella_, and\r\n_Crania_ (fig. 195). In the last mentioned of these, the shell\r\nis attached to foreign bodies by the substance of one of the\r\nvalves (the ventral), whilst the other or free valve is more\r\nor less limpet-shaped. All the above-mentioned genera are in\r\nexistence at the present day; and one _species_--namely,\r\n_Terebratulina striata_--appears to be undistinguishable from\r\none now living--the _Terebratulina caputserpentis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193.--A small fragment of _Escharina Oceani_,\r\nof the natural size; and a portion of the same enlarged. Upper\r\nGreensand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194.--_Terebratella Astieriana_. Gault.]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Lamp-shells are slowly declining, the Bivalves\r\n(_Limellibranchs_) are greatly developed, and are amongst the\r\nmost abundant and characteristic fossils of the Cretaceous period.\r\nIn the great river-deposit of the Wealden, the Bivalves are forms\r\nproper to fresh water, belonging to the existing River-mussels\r\n(_Unio_), _Cyrena_ and _Cyclas_; but most of the Cretaceous\r\nLamellibranchs are marine. Some of the most abundant and\r\ncharacteristic of these belong to the great family of the Oysters\r\n(_Ostreidoe_). Amongst these are the genera _Gryphtoea_ and\r\n_Exogyra_, both of which we have seen to occur abundantly in the\r\nJurassic; and there are also numerous true Oysters (_Ostrea_,\r\nfig. 196) and Thorny Oysters (_Spondylus_, fig. 197). The genus\r\n_Trigonia_, so characteristic of the Mesozoic deposits in general,\r\nis likewise well represented in the Cretaceous strata. No single\r\ngenus of Bivalves is, however, so highly characteristic of the\r\nCretaceous period as _Inoceramus_, a group belonging to the family\r\nof the Pearl-mussels (_Aviculidoe_). The shells of this genus\r\n(fig. 198) have the valves unequal in size, the larger valve often\r\nbeing much twisted, and both valves being marked with radiating\r\nribs or concentric furrows. The hinge-line is long and straight,\r\nwith numerous pits for the attachment of the ligament which serves\r\nto open the shell. Some of the _Inocerami_ attain a length of\r\ntwo or three feet, and fragments of the shell are often found\r\nperforated by boring Sponges. Another extraordinary family of\r\nBivalves, which is exclusively confined to the Cretaceous rocks,\r\nis that of the _Hippuritidoe_. All the members of this group\r\n(fig. 199) were attached to foreign objects, and lived associated\r\nin beds, like Oysters. The two valves of the shell are always\r\naltogether unlike in sculpturing, appearance, shape, and size;\r\nand the cast of the interior of the shell is often extremely\r\nunlike the form of the outer surface. The type-genus of the family\r\nis _Hippurites_ itself (fig. 199), in which the shell is in the\r\nshape of a straight or slightly-twisted horn, sometimes a foot\r\nor more in length, constituted by the attached lower valve, and\r\nclosed above by a small lid-like free upper valve. About a hundred\r\nspecies of the family of the _Hippuritidoe_ are known, all of these\r\nbeing Cretaceous, and occurring in Britain (one species only), in\r\nSouthern Europe, the West Indies, North America, Algeria, and\r\nEgypt. Species of this family occur in such numbers in certain\r\ncompact marbles in the south of Europe, of the age of the Upper\r\nCretaceous (Lower Chalk), as to have given origin to the name\r\nof \"Hippurite Limestones,\" applied to these strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195.--_Crania Ignabergensis_. The left-hand\r\nfigure shows the perfect shell, attached by its ventral valve\r\nto a foreign body; the middle figure shows the exterior of the\r\nlimpet-shaped dorsal valve; and the right-hand figure represents\r\nthe interior of the attached valve. White Chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196.--_Ostrea Couloni_. Lower Greensand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197.--_Spondylus spinosus_. White Chalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198.--_Inoceramus sulcatus_. Gault.]\r\n\r\nThe Univalves (_Gasteropods_) of the Cretaceous period are not\r\nvery numerous, nor particularly remarkable. Along with species of\r\nthe persistent genus _Pleurotomaria_ and the Mesozoic _Nerinoea_,\r\nwe meet with examples of such modern types as _Turritella_ and\r\n_Natica_, the Staircase-shells (_Solarium_), the Wentle-traps\r\n(_Scalaria_), the Carrier-shells (_Phorus_), &c. Towards the close\r\nof the Cretaceous period, and especially in such transitional strata\r\nas the Maestricht beds, the Faxöe Limestone, and the Pisolitic\r\nLimestone of France, we meet with a number of carnivorous\r\n(\"siphonostomatous\") Univalves, in which the mouth of the shell is\r\nnotched or produced into a canal. Amongst these it is interesting\r\nto recognise examples of such existing genera as the Volutes\r\n(_Voluta_, fig. 200), the Cowries (_Cyproea_), the Mitre-shells\r\n(_Mitra_), the Wing - shells (_Strombus_), the Scorpion-shells\r\n(_Pteroceras_), &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199.--_Hippurites Toucasiana_. A large\r\nindividual, with two smaller ones attached to it. Upper Cretaceous,\r\nSouth of Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200.--_Voluta elongata_. White Chalk.]\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the most characteristic of all the Cretaceous\r\nMolluscs are the _Cephalopods_, represented by the remains of\r\nboth _Tetrabranchiate_ and _Dibranchiate_ forms. Amongst the\r\nformer, the long-lived genus _Nautilus_ (fig. 201) again reappears,\r\nwith its involute shell, its capacious body-chamber, its simple\r\nsepta between the air-chambers, and its nearly or quite central\r\nsiphuncle. The majority of the chambered _Cephalopods_ of the\r\nCretaceous belong, however, to the complex and beautiful family\r\nof the _Ammonitidoe_, with their elaborately folded and lobed\r\nsepta and dorsally-placed siphuncle. This family disappears wholly\r\nat the close of the Cretaceous period; but its approaching\r\nextinction, so far from being signalised by any slow decrease\r\nand diminution in the number of specific or generic types, seems\r\nto have been attended by the development of whole series of new\r\nforms. The genus _Ammonites_ itself, dating from the Carboniferous,\r\nhas certainly passed its prime, but it is still represented by\r\nmany species, and some of these attained enormous dimensions\r\n(two or three feet in diameter). The genus _Ancyloceras_ (fig.\r\n202), though likewise of more ancient origin (Jurassic), is\r\nnevertheless very characteristic of the Cretaceous. In this genus\r\nthe first portion of the shell is in the form of a flat spiral,\r\nthe coils of which are not in contact; and its last portion is\r\nproduced at a tangent, becoming ultimately bent back in the form\r\nof a crosier. Besides these pre-existent types, the Cretaceous\r\nrocks have yielded a great number of entirely new forms of the\r\n_Ammonitidoe_, which are not known in any deposits of earlier or\r\nlater date. Amongst the more important of these may be mentioned\r\n_Crioceras, Turrilites, Scaphites, Hamites, Ptychoceras_, and\r\n_Baulites_. In the genus _Crioceras_ (fig. 204, d), the shell\r\nconsists of an open spiral, the volutions of which are not in\r\ncontact, thus resembling a partially-unrolled _Ammonite_ or the\r\ninner portion of an _Ancyloceras_. In _Turrilites_ (fig. 203), the\r\nshell is precisely like that of the _Ammonite_ in its structure;\r\nbut instead of forming a flat spiral, it is coiled into an elevated\r\nturreted shell, the whorls of which are in contact with one another.\r\nIn the genus _Scaphites_ (fig. 204, e), the shell resembles that\r\nof _Ancyloceras_ in consisting of a series of volutions coiled\r\ninto a flat spiral, the last being detached from the others,\r\nproduced, and ultimately bent back in the form of a crosier; but\r\nthe whorls of the enrolled part of the shell are in contact,\r\ninstead of being separate as in the latter. In the genus _Hamites_\r\n(fig. 204, f), the shell is an extremely elongated cone, which\r\nis bent upon itself more than once, in a hook-like manner, all\r\nthe volutions being separate. The genus _Ptychoteras_ (fig. 204,\r\na) is very like _Hamites_, except that the shell is only bent\r\nonce; and the two portions thus bent are in contact with one\r\nanother. Lastly, in the genus _Baculites_ (fig. 204, b and\r\nc) the shell is simply a straight elongated cone, not bent\r\nin any way, but possessing the folded septa which characterise\r\nthe whole Ammonite family. The _Baculite_ is the simplest of\r\nall the forms of the _Ammonitidoe_; and all the other forms,\r\nhowever complex, may be regarded as being simply produced by the\r\nbending or folding of such a conical septate shell in different\r\nways. The _Baculite_, therefore, corresponds, in the series of\r\nthe _Ammonitidoe_, to the _Orthoceras_ in the series of the\r\n_Nautilidoe_. All the above-mentioned genera are characteristically,\r\nor exclusively, Cretaceous, and they are accompanied by a number\r\nof other allied forms, which cannot be noticed here. Not a single\r\none of these genera, further, has hitherto been detected in any\r\nstrata higher than the Cretaceous. We may therefore consider that\r\nthese wonderful, varied, and elaborate forms of _Ammonitidoe_\r\nconstitute one of the most conspicuous features in the life of\r\nthe Chalk period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201.--Different views of _Nautilus Danicus_.\r\nFaxöe Limestone (Upper Cretaceous), Denmark.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202.--_Ancyloceras Matheronianus_. Gault.]\r\n\r\nThe _Dibranchiate Cephalopods_ are represented partly by the\r\nbeak-like jaws of unknown species of Cuttle-fishes and partly\r\nby the internal skeletons of Belemnites. Amongst the latter,\r\nthe genus _Belemnites_ itself holds its place in the lower part\r\nof the Cretaceous series; but it disappears in the upper portion\r\nof the series, and its place is taken by the nearly-allied genus\r\n_Belemnitella_ (fig. 205), distinguished by the possession of\r\na straight fissure in the upper end of the guard. This also\r\ndisappears at the close of the Cretaceous period; and no member\r\nof the great Mesozoic family of the _Belemnitidoe_ has hitherto\r\nbeen discovered in any Tertiary deposit, or is known to exist\r\nat the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203.--_Turrilites catenatus_. The lower figure\r\nrepresents the entire shell; the upper figure represents the\r\nbase of the shell seen from below. Gault.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204.--a, _Ptychoceras Emericianum_,\r\nreduced--Lower Greensand; b, _Baculites anceps_, reduced--Chalk;\r\nc, Portion of the same, showing the folded edges of the septa;\r\nd, _Crioceras cristatum_, reduced--Gault; e, _Scaphites oequalis_,\r\nnatural size--Chalk; f, _Hamites rotundus_, restored--Gault.]\r\n\r\nPassing on next to the _Vertebrate Animals_ of the Cretaceous\r\nperiod, we find the _Fishes_ represented as before by the Ganoids\r\nand the Placoids, to which, however, we can now add the first\r\nknown examples of the great group of the _Bony Fishes_ or\r\n_Teleosteans_, comprising the great majority of existing forms.\r\nThe _Ganoid_ fishes of the Cretaceous (_Lepidotus, Pycnodus_,\r\n&c.) present no features of special interest. Little, also, need\r\nbe said about the _Placoid_ fishes of this period. As in the\r\nJurassic deposits, the remains of these consist partly of the\r\nteeth of genuine Sharks (_Lamna, Odontaspis_, &c.) and partly\r\nof the teeth and defensive spines of Cestracionts, such as the\r\nliving Port-Jackson Shark. The pointed and sharp-edged teeth of\r\ntrue Sharks are very abundant in some beds, such as the Upper\r\nGreensand, and are beautifully preserved. The teeth of some forms\r\n(_Carcharias_, &c.) attain occasionally a length of three or four\r\ninches, and indicate the existence in the Cretaceous seas of\r\nhuge predaceous fishes, probably larger than any existing Sharks.\r\nThe remains of _Cestracionts_ consist partly of the flattened\r\nteeth of genera such as _Acrodus_ and _Ptychodus_ (the latter\r\nconfined to rocks of this age), and partly of the pointed teeth\r\nof _Hybodus_, a genus which dates from the Trias. In this genus\r\nthe teeth (fig. 206) consist of a principal central cone, flanked\r\nby minor lateral cones; and the fin-spines (fig. 207) are\r\nlongitudinally grooved, and carry a series of small spines on\r\ntheir hinder or concave margin. Lastly, the great modern order\r\nof the Bony Fishes or _Teleosteans_ makes its first appearance\r\nin the Upper Cretaceous rocks, where it is represented by forms\r\nbelonging to no less than three existing groups--namely, the\r\nSalmon family (_Salmonidoe_), the Herring family (_Clupeidoe_),\r\nand the Perch family (_Percidoe_). All these fishes have thin,\r\nhorny, overlapping scales, symmetrical (\"homocercal\") tails,\r\nand bony skeletons. The genus _Beryx_ (fig. 208, 1) is one\r\nrepresented by existing species at the present day, and belongs\r\nto the Perch family. The genus _Osmeroides_, again (fig. 208,\r\n2), is supposed to be related to the living Smelts (_Osmerus_),\r\nand, therefore, to belong to the Salmon tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205.--Guard of _Belemnitella mucronata_. White\r\nChalk.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206.--Tooth of _Hybodus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207.--Fin-spine of _Hybodus_. Lower Greensand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208.--1, _Beryx Lewesiensis_, a Percoid fish\r\nfrom the Chalk; 2, _Osmeroides Mantelli_, a Salmonoid fish from\r\nthe Chalk.]\r\n\r\nNo remains of _Amphibians_ have hitherto been detected in any part\r\nof the Cretaceous series; but _Reptiles_ are extremely numerous,\r\nand belong to very varied types. As regards the great extinct groups\r\nof Reptiles which characterise the Mesozoic period as a whole, the\r\nhuge \"Enaliosaurs\" or \"Sea-Lizards\" are still represented by the\r\n_Ichthyosaur_ and the _Plesiosaur_. Nearly allied to the latter\r\nof these is the _Elasmosaurus_ of the American Cretaceous, which\r\ncombined the long tail of the Ichthyosaur with the long neck\r\nof the Plesiosaur. The length of this monstrous Reptile could not\r\nhave been less than fifty feet, the neck consisting of over sixty\r\nvertebræ and measuring over twenty feet in length. The extraordinary\r\nFlying Reptiles of the Jurassic are likewise well represented in\r\nthe Cretaceous rocks by species of the genus _Pterodactylus_\r\nitself, and these later forms are much more gigantic in their\r\ndimensions than their predecessors. Thus some of the Cretaceous\r\nPterosaurs seem to have had a spread of wing of from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet, more than realising the \"Dragons\" of fable in\r\npoint of size. The most remarkable, however, of the Cretaceous\r\n_Pterosaurs_ are the forms which have recently been described\r\nby Professor Marsh under the generic title of _Pteranodon_. In\r\nthese singular forms--so far only known as American--the animal\r\npossessed a skeleton in all respects similar to that of the typical\r\nPterodactyles, except that the jaws are completely destitute of\r\nteeth. There is, therefore, the strongest probability that the\r\njaws were encased in a horny sheath, thus coming to resemble the\r\nbeak of a Bird. Some of the recognised species of _Pteranodon_\r\nare very small; but the skull of one species (_P. Longiceps_)\r\nis not less than a yard in length, and there are portions of\r\nthe skull of another species which would indicate a length of\r\nfour feet for the cranium. These measurements would point to\r\ndimensions larger than those of any other known Pterosaurs.\r\n\r\nThe great Mesozoic order of the _Deinosaurs_ is largely represented\r\nin the Cretaceous rocks, partly by genera which previously existed\r\nin the Jurassic period, and partly by entirely new types. The great\r\ndelta-deposit of the Wealden, in the Old World, has yielded the\r\nremains of various of these huge terrestrial Reptiles, and very\r\nmany others have been found in the Cretaceous deposits of North\r\nAmerica. One of the most celebrated of the Cretaceous Deinosaurs\r\nis the _Iguanodon_, so called from the curious resemblance of\r\nits teeth to those of the existing but comparatively diminutive\r\n_Iguana_. The teeth (fig. 209) are soldered to the inner face\r\nof the jaw, instead of being sunk in distinct sockets; and they\r\nhave the form of somewhat flattened prisms, longitudinally ridged\r\non the outer surface, with an obtusely triangular crown, and\r\nhaving the enamel crenated on one or both sides. They present\r\nthe extraordinary feature that the crowns became worn down flat\r\nby mastication, showing that the _Iguanodon_ employed its teeth\r\nin actually chewing and triturating the vegetable matter on which\r\nit fed. There can therefore be no doubt but that the _Iguanodon_,\r\nin spite of its immense bulk, was an herbivorous Reptile, and lived\r\nprincipally on the foliage of the Cretaceous forests amongst which\r\nit dwelt. Its size has been variously estimated at from thirty to\r\nfifty feet, the thigh-bone in large examples measuring nearly\r\nfive feet in length, with a circumference of twenty-two inches\r\nin its smallest part. With the strong and massive hind-limbs are\r\nassociated comparatively weak and small fore-limbs; and there\r\nseems little reason to doubt that the _Iguanodon_ must have walked\r\ntemporarily or permanently upon its hind-limbs, after the manner of\r\na Bird. This conjecture is further supported by the occurrence in\r\nthe strata which contain the bones of the _Iguanodon_ of gigantic\r\nthree-toed foot-prints, disposed _singly_ in a double track. These\r\nprints have undoubtedly been produced by some animal walking on\r\ntwo legs; and they can hardly, with any probability, be ascribed\r\nto any other than this enormous Reptile. Closely allied to the\r\n_Iguanodon_ is the _Hadrosaurus_ of the American Cretaceous, the\r\nlength of which is estimated at twenty-eight feet. _Iguanodon_\r\ndoes not appear to have possessed any integumentary skeleton; but\r\nthe great _Hyloeosaurus_ of the Wealden seems to have been furnished\r\nwith a longitudinal crest of large spines running down the back,\r\nsimilar to that which is found in the comparatively small Iguanas\r\nof the present day. The _Megalosaurus_ of the Oolites continued\r\nto exist in the Cretaceous period; and, as we have previously\r\nseen, it was carnivorous in its habits. The American _Loelaps_\r\nwas also carnivorous, and, like the Megalosaur, which it very\r\nclosely resembles, appears to have walked upon its hind-legs,\r\nthe fore-limbs being disproportionately small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209.--Teeth of Iguanodon Mantellii. Wealden,\r\nBritain.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable group of Reptiles, exclusively confined to\r\nthe Cretaceous series, is that of the _Mosasauroids_, so called\r\nfrom the type-genus _Mosasaurus_. The first species of _Mosasaurus_\r\nknown to science was the _M. Camperi_ (fig. 210), the skull of\r\nwhich--six feet in length--was discovered in 1780 in the Maestricht\r\nChalk at Maestricht. As this town stands on the river Meuse,\r\nthe name of _Mosasaurus_ (\"Lizard of the Meuse\") was applied\r\nto this immense Reptile. Of late years the remains of a large\r\nnumber of Reptiles more or less closely related to _Mosasaurus_, or\r\nabsolutely belonging to it, have been discovered in the Cretaceous\r\ndeposits of North America, and have been described by Professors\r\nCope and Marsh. All the known forms of this group appear to have\r\nbeen of large size--one of them, _Mosasaurus princeps_, attaining\r\nthe length of seventy-five or eighty feet, and thus rivalling\r\nthe largest of existing Whales in its dimensions. The teeth in\r\nthe \"Mosasauroids\" are long, pointed, and slightly curved; and\r\ninstead of being sunk in distinct sockets, they are firmly\r\namalgamated with the jaws, as in modern Lizards. The palate also\r\ncarried teeth, and the lower jaw was so constructed as to allow\r\nof the mouth being opened to an immense width, somewhat as in the\r\nliving Serpents. The body was long and snake-like, with a very\r\nlong tail, which is laterally compressed, and must have served as\r\na powerful swimming-apparatus. In addition to this, both pairs\r\nof limbs have the bones connecting them with the trunk greatly\r\nshortened; whilst the digits were enclosed in the integuments,\r\nand constituted paddles, closely resembling in structure the\r\n\"flippers\" of Whales and Dolphins. The neck is sometimes moderately\r\nlong, but oftener very short, as the great size and weight of\r\nthe head would have led one to anticipate. Bony plates seem in\r\nsome species to have formed an at any rate partial covering to\r\nthe skin; but it is not certain that these integumentary appendages\r\nwere present in all. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but\r\nthat the Mosasauroid Reptiles--the true \"Sea-serpents\" of the\r\nCretaceous period--were essentially aquatic in their habits,\r\nfrequenting the sea, and only occasionally coming to the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210.--Skull of _Mosasaurus Camperi_, greatly\r\nreduced. Maestricht Chalk.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Mosasauroids\" have generally been regarded as a greatly\r\nmodified group of the Lizards (_Lacertilia_). Whether this reference\r\nbe correct or not--and recent investigations render it dubious--the\r\nCretaceous rocks have yielded the remains of small Lizards not widely\r\nremoved from existing forms. The recent order of the _Chelonians_\r\nis also represented in the Cretaceous rocks, by forms closely\r\nresembling living types. Thus the fresh-water deposits of the\r\nWealden have yielded examples of the \"Terrapins\" or \"Mud-Turtles\"\r\n(_Emys_); and the marine Cretaceous strata have been found to\r\ncontain the remains of various species of Turtles, one of which\r\nis here figured (fig. 211). No true Serpents (_Ophidia_) have\r\nas yet been detected in the Cretaceous rocks; and this order\r\ndoes not appear to have come into existence till the Tertiary\r\nperiod. Lastly, true Crocodiles are known to have existed in\r\nconsiderable numbers in the Cretaceous period. The oldest of\r\nthese occur in the fresh-water deposit of the Wealden; and they\r\ndiffer from the existing forms of the group in the fact that the\r\nbodies of the vertebræ, like those of the Jurassic Crocodiles,\r\nare bi-concave, or hollowed out at both ends. In the Greensand\r\nof North America, however, occur the remains of Crocodiles which\r\nagree with all the living species in having the bodies of the\r\nvertebræ in the region of the back hollowed out in front and\r\nconvex behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211.--Carapace of _Chelone Benstedi_. Lower\r\nChalk. (After Owen.)]\r\n\r\n_Birds_ have not hitherto been shown, with certainty, to have\r\nexisted in Europe during the Cretaceous period, except in a few\r\ninstances in which fragmentary remains belonging to this class\r\nhave been discovered. The Cretaceous deposits of North America\r\nhave, however, been shown by Professor Marsh to contain a\r\nconsiderable number of the remains of Birds, often in a state\r\nof excellent preservation. Some of these belong to Swimming or\r\nWading Birds, differing in no point of special interest from\r\nmodern birds of similar habits. Others, however, exhibit such\r\nextraordinary peculiarities that they merit more than a passing\r\nnotice. One of the forms in question constitutes the genus\r\n_Ichthyornis_ of Marsh, the type-species of which (_I. Dispar_)\r\nwas about as large as a Pigeon. In two remarkable respects, this\r\nsingular Bird differs from all known living members of the class.\r\nOne of these respects concerns the jaws, both of which exhibit the\r\nReptilian character of being armed with numerous small pointed\r\n_teeth_ (fig. 212, a), sunk in distinct sockets. No existing\r\nbird possesses teeth; and this character forcibly recalls the\r\nBird-like Pterosaurs, with their toothed jaws. _Ichthyornis_,\r\nhowever, possessed fore-limbs constructed strictly on the type\r\nof the \"wing\" of the living Birds; and it cannot, therefore, be\r\nseparated from this class. Another extraordinary peculiarity\r\nof _Ichthyornis_ is, that the bodies of the _vertebrie_ (fig.\r\n212, c) were _bi-concave_, as is the case with many extinct\r\nReptiles and almost all Fishes, but as does not occur in any\r\nliving Bird. There can be little doubt that _Ichthyornis_ was\r\naquatic in its habits, and that it lived principally upon fishes;\r\nbut its powerful wings at the same time indicate that it was\r\ncapable of prolonged flight. The tail of _Ichthyornis_ has,\r\nunfortunately, not been discovered; and it is at present impossible\r\nto say whether this resembled the tail of existing Birds, or\r\nwhether it was elongated and composed of separate vertebræ, as\r\nin the Jurassic _Archoeopteryx_.\r\n\r\nStill more wonderful than _Ichthyornis_ is the marvellous bird\r\ndescribed by Marsh under the name of _Hesperornis regalis_. This\r\npresents us with a gigantic diving bird, somewhat resembling the\r\nexisting \"Loons\" (_Colymbus_), but agreeing with _Ichthyornis_\r\nin having the jaws furnished with conical, recurved, pointed\r\nteeth (fig. 212, b). Hence these forms are grouped together in\r\na new sub-class, under the name of _Odontornithes_ or \"Toothed\r\nBirds.\" The teeth of _Hesperornis_ (fig. 212, d) resemble those\r\nof _Ichthyornis_ in their general form; but instead of being\r\nsunk in distinct sockets, they are simply implanted in a deep\r\ncontinuous groove in the bony substance of the jaw. The front of\r\nthe upper jaw does not carry teeth, and was probably encased in\r\na horny beak. The breast-bone is entirely destitute of a central\r\nridge or keel, and the wings are minute and quite rudimentary; so\r\nthat _Hesperornis_, unlike _Ichthyornis_, must have been wholly\r\ndeprived of the power of flight, in this respect approaching the\r\nexisting Penguins. The tail consists of about twelve vertebræ,\r\nof which the last three or four are amalgamated to form a flat\r\nterminal mass, there being at the same time clear indications\r\nthat the tail was capable of up and down movement in a vertical\r\nplane, this probably fitting it to serve as a swimming-paddle or\r\nrudder. The legs were powerfully constructed, and the feet were\r\nadapted to assist the bird in rapid motion through the water. The\r\nknown remains of _Hesperornis regalis_ prove it to have been a\r\nswimming and diving bird, of larger dimensions than any of the\r\naquatic members of the class of Birds with which we are acquainted\r\nat the present day. It appears to have stood between five and six\r\nfeet high, and its inability to fly is fully compensated for by the\r\nnumerous adaptations of its structure to a watery life. Its teeth\r\nprove it to have been carnivorous in its habits, and it probably\r\nlived upon fishes. It is a curious fact that two Birds agreeing\r\nwith one another in the wholly abnormal character of possessing\r\nteeth, and in other respects so entirely different, should, like\r\n_Ichthyornis_ and _Hesperornis_, have lived not only in the same\r\ngeological period, but also in the same geographical area; and\r\nit is equally curious that the area inhabited by these toothed\r\nBirds should at the same time have been tenanted by winged and\r\nbird-like Reptiles belonging to the toothed genus _Pterodactylus_\r\nand the toothless genus _Pteranodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 212.--Toothed Birds (_Odontornithes_) of the\r\nCretaceous Rocks of America. a.

In\r\nthe first place, there is in the Old World a complete and entire\r\nphysical break between the rocks of the Mesozoic and Kainozoic\r\nperiods. In no instance in Europe are Tertiary strata to be found\r\nresting conformably upon any Secondary rock. The Chalk has invariably\r\nsuffered much erosion and denudation before the lowest Tertiary\r\nstrata were deposited upon it. This is shown by the fact that the\r\nactually eroded surface of the Chalk can often be seen; or, failing\r\nthis, that we can point to the presence of the chalk-flints in the\r\nTertiary strata. This last, of course, affords unquestionable proof\r\nthat the Chalk must have been subjected to enormous denudation\r\nprior to the formation of the Tertiary beds, all the chalk itself\r\nhaving been removed, and nothing left but the flints, while these\r\nare all rolled and rounded. In the continent of North America,\r\non the other hand, the lowest Tertiary strata have been shown\r\nto graduate downwards conformably with the highest Cretaceous\r\nbeds, it being a matter of difficulty to draw a precise line\r\nof demarcation between the two formations.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there is a marked break in the _life_ of\r\nthe Mesozoic and Kainozoic periods. With the exception of a few\r\n_Foraminifera_, and one _Brachiopod_ (the latter doubtful), no\r\nCretaceous species is known to have survived the Cretaceous period;\r\nwhile several characteristic _families_, such as the _Ammonitidoe,\r\nBelemnitidoe_, and _Hippuritidoe_, died out entirely with the\r\nclose of the Cretaceous rocks. In the Tertiary rocks, on the\r\nother hand, not only are all the animals and plants more or less\r\nlike existing types, but we meet with a constantly-increasing\r\nnumber of _living species_ as we pass from the bottom of the\r\nKainozoic series to the top. Upon this last fact is founded the\r\nmodern classification of the Kainozoic rocks, propounded by Sil\r\nCharles Lyell.\r\n\r\nThe absence in strata of Tertiary age of the chambered Cephalopods,\r\nthe Belemnites, the _Hippurites_, the _Inocerami_, and the\r\ndiversified types of Reptiles which form such conspicuous features\r\nin the Cretaceous fauna, render the palæontological break between\r\nthe Chalk and the Eocene one far too serious to be overlooked. At\r\nthe same time, it is to be remembered that the evidence afforded\r\nby the explorations carried out of late years as to the animal\r\nlife of the deep sea, renders it certain that the extinction\r\nof marine forms of life at the close of the Cretaceous period\r\nwas far less extensive than had been previously assumed. It is\r\ntolerably certain, in fact, that we may look upon some of the\r\ninhabitants of the depths of our existing oceans as the direct,\r\nif modified, descendants of animals which were in existence when\r\nthe Chalk was deposited.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the general want of conformity between the Cretaceous\r\nand Tertiary rocks, and still more from the great difference in\r\nlife, that the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods are separated, in\r\nthe Old World at any rate, by an enormous lapse of unrepresented\r\ntime. How long this interval may have been, we have no means of\r\njudging exactly, but it very possibly was as long as the whole\r\nKainozoic epoch itself. Some day we shall doubtless find, at some\r\npart of the earth's surface, marine strata which were deposited\r\nduring this period, and which will contain fossils intermediate\r\nin character between the organic remains which respectively\r\ncharacterise the Secondary and Tertiary periods. At present, we\r\nhave only slight traces of such deposits--as, for instance, the\r\nMaestricht beds, the Faxöe Limestone, and the Pisolitic Limestone\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE TERTIARY ROCKS.--The classification of the\r\nTertiary rocks is a matter of unusual difficulty, in consequence\r\nof their occurring in disconnected basins, forming a series of\r\ndetached areas, which hold no relations of superposition to one\r\nanother. The order, therefore, of the Tertiaries in point of\r\ntime, can only be determined by an appeal to fossils; and in\r\nsuch determination Sir Charles Lyell proposed to take as the\r\nbasis of classification the _proportion of living or existing\r\nspecies of Mollusca which occurs in each stratum or group of\r\nstrata_. Acting upon this principle, Sir Charles Lyell divides\r\nthe Tertiary series into four groups:--\r\n\r\nI. The _Eocene_ formation (Gr. _eos_, dawn; _kainos_, new),\r\ncontaining the smallest proportion of existing species, and being,\r\ntherefore, the oldest division. In this classification, only\r\nthe _Mollusca_ are taken into account; and it was found that of\r\nthese about three and a half per cent were identical with existing\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nII. The _Miocene_ formation (Gr. _meion_, less; _kainos_, new),\r\nwith more recent species than the Eocene, but _less_ than the\r\nsucceeding formation, and less than one-half the total number\r\nin the formation. As before, only the _Mollusca_ are taken into\r\naccount, and about 17 per cent of these agree with existing species.\r\n\r\nIII. The _Pliocene_ formation (Gr. _pleion_, more; _kainos_, new),\r\nwith generally _more_ than half the species of shells identical\r\nwith existing species--the proportion of these varying from 35\r\nto 50 per cent in the lower beds of this division, up to 90 or\r\n95 per cent in its higher portion.\r\n\r\nIV. The _Post-Tertiary Formations_, in which all _the shells\r\nbelong to existing species_. This, in turn, is divided into two\r\nminor groups--the _Post-Pliocene_ and _Recent Formations_. In\r\nthe _Post-Pliocene_ formations, while all the _Mollusca_ belong\r\nto existing species, most of the _Mammals_ belong to extinct\r\nspecies. In the Recent period, the quadrupeds, as well as the\r\nshells, belong to living species.\r\n\r\nThe above, with some modifications, was the original classification\r\nproposed by Sir Charles Lyell for the Tertiary rocks, and now\r\nuniversally accepted. More recent researches, it is true, have\r\nsomewhat altered the proportions of existing species to extinct,\r\nas stated above. The general principle, however, of an increase\r\nin the number of living species, still holds good; and this is as\r\nyet the only satisfactory basis upon which it has been proposed\r\nto arrange the Tertiary deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nEOCENE FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene rocks are the lowest of the Tertiary series, and comprise\r\nall those Tertiary deposits in which there is only a small proportion\r\nof existing _Mollusca_--from three and a half to five per cent.\r\nThe Eocene rocks occur in several basins in Britain, France,\r\nthe Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, and in the United\r\nStates. The subdivisions which have been established are extremely\r\nnumerous, and it is often impossible to parallel those of one\r\nbasin with those of another. It will be sufficient, therefore,\r\nto accept the division of the Eocene formation into three great\r\ngroups--Lower, Middle, and Upper Eocene--and to consider some of\r\nthe more important beds comprised under these heads in Europe\r\nand in North America.\r\n\r\nI. EOCENE OF BRITAIN. (1.) LOWER EOCENE.--The base of the Eocene\r\nseries in Britain is constituted by about 90 feet of light-coloured,\r\nsometimes argillaceous sands (_Thanet Sands_), which are of marine\r\norigin. Above these, or forming the base of the formation where these\r\nare wanting, come mottled clays and sands with lignite (_Woolwich\r\nand Reading series_), which are estuarine or fluvio-marine in\r\norigin. The highest member of the Lower Eocene of Britain is the\r\n\"London Clay,\" consisting of a great mass of dark-brown or blue\r\nclay, sometimes with sandy beds, or with layers of \"septaria,\"\r\nthe whole attaining a thickness of from 200 to as much as 500\r\nfeet. The London Clay is a purely marine deposit, containing\r\nmany marine fossils, with the remains of terrestrial animals and\r\nplants; all of which indicate a high temperature of the sea and\r\ntropical or sub-tropical conditions of the land.\r\n\r\n(2.) MIDDLE EOCENE.--The inferior portion of the Middle Eocene\r\nof Britain consists of marine beds, chiefly consisting of sand,\r\nclays, and gravels, and attaining a very considerable thickness\r\n(_Bag-shot and Bracklesham beds_). The superior portion of the\r\nMiddle Eocene of Britain, on the other hand, consists of deposits\r\nwhich are almost exclusively fresh-water or brackish-water in\r\norigin (_Headon and Osborne series_).\r\n\r\nThe chief Continental formations of Middle Eocene age are the\r\n\"Calcaire grossier\" of the Paris basin, and the \"Nummulitic\r\nLimestone\" of the Alps.\r\n\r\n(3.) UPPER EOCENE.--If the Headon and Osborne beds of the Isle\r\nof Wight be placed in the Middle Eocene, the only British\r\nrepresentatives of the Upper Eocene are the _Bembridge beds_.\r\nThese strata consist of limestones, clays, and marls, which have\r\nfor the most part been deposited in fresh or brackish water.\r\n\r\nII. EOCENE BEDS OF THE PARIS BASIN.--The Eocene strata are very\r\nwell developed in the neighbourhood of Paris, where they occupy\r\na large area or basin scooped out of the Chalk. The beds of this\r\narea are partly marine, partly freshwater in origin; and the\r\nfollowing table (after Sir Charles Lyell) shows their subdivisions\r\nand their parallelism with the English series:--\r\n\r\n              GENERAL TABLE OF FRENCH EOCENE STRATA.\r\n\r\n                          UPPER EOCENE.\r\n\r\n    _French Subdivisions._         _English Equivalents._\r\n A. 1.

Thanet sands.\r\n\r\nIII. EOCENE STRATA OF THE UNITED STATES.--The lowest member of\r\nthe Eocene deposits of North America is the so-called \"_Lignitic\r\nFormation_,\" which is largely developed in Mississippi, Tennessee,\r\nArkansas, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and California, and sometimes\r\nattains a thickness of several thousand feet. Stratigraphically,\r\nthis formation exhibits the interesting point that it graduates\r\ndownwards insensibly and conformably into the Cretaceous, whilst\r\nit is succeeded _uncomformably_ by strata of Middle Eocene age.\r\nLithologically, the series consists principally of sands and\r\nclays, with beds of lignite and coal, and its organic remains\r\nshow that it is principally of fresh-water origin with a partial\r\nintermixture of marine beds. These marine strata of the \"Lignitic\r\nformation\" are of special interest, as showing such a commingling\r\nof Cretaceous and Tertiary types of life, that it is impossible\r\nto draw any rigid line in this region between the Mesozoic and\r\nKainozoic systems. Thus the marine beds of the Lignitic series\r\ncontain such characteristic Cretaceous forms as _Inoceramus_\r\nand _Ammonites_, along with a great number of Univalves of a\r\ndistinctly Tertiary type (Cones, Cowries, &c.) Upon the whole,\r\ntherefore, we must regard this series of deposits as affording a\r\nkind of transition between the Cretaceous and the Eocene, holding\r\nin some respects a position which may be compared with that held\r\nby the Purbeck beds in Britain as regards the Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Eocene of the United States is represented by the\r\n_Claiborne_ and _Jackson_ beds. The _Claiborne series_ is extensively\r\ndeveloped at Claiborne, Alabama, and consists of sands, clays,\r\nlignites, marls, and impure limestones, containing marine fossils\r\nalong with numerous plant-remains. The _Jackson series_ is\r\nrepresented by lignitic clays and marls which occur at Jackson,\r\nMississippi. Amongst the more remarkable fossils of this series\r\nare the teeth and bones of Cetaceans of the genus _Zeuglodon_.\r\n\r\nStrata of Upper Eocene age occur in North America at Vicksburg,\r\nMississippi, and are known as the _Vicksburg series_. They consist\r\nof lignites, clays, marls, and limestones. Freshwater deposits\r\nof Eocene age are also largely developed in parts of the Rocky\r\nMountain region. The most remarkable fossils of these beds are\r\nMammals, of which a large number of species have been already\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE EOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the Eocene deposits are so numerous that nothing\r\nmore can be attempted here than to give a brief and general sketch\r\nof the life of the period, special attention being directed to some\r\nof the more prominent and interesting types, amongst which--as\r\nthroughout the Tertiary series--the Mammals hold the first place.\r\nIt is not uncommon, indeed, to speak of the Tertiary period as a\r\nwhole under the name of the \"Age of Mammals,\" a title at least\r\nas well deserved as that of \"Age of Reptiles\" applied to the\r\nMesozoic, or \"Age of Molluscs\" applied to the Palæozoic epoch.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _plants_ of the Eocene, the chief point to be\r\nnoticed is, that the conditions which had already set in with\r\nthe commencement of the Upper Cretaceous, are here continued,\r\nand still further enforced. The _Cycads_ of the Secondary period,\r\nif they have not totally disappeared, are exceedingly rare; and\r\nthe _Conifers_, losing the predominance which they enjoyed in the\r\nMesozoic, are now relegated to a subordinate though well-defined\r\nplace in the terrestrial vegetation. The great majority of the\r\nEocene plants are referable to the groups of the Angiospermous\r\nExogens and the Monocotyledons; and the vegetation of the period,\r\nupon the whole, approximates closely to that now existing upon\r\nthe earth. The plants of the European Eocene are, however, in the\r\nmain most closely allied to forms which are now characteristic\r\nof tropical or sub-tropical regions. Thus, in the London Clay\r\nare found numerous fruits of Palms (_Napdites_, fig. 213), along\r\nwith various other plants, most of which indicate a warm climate\r\nas prevailing in the south of England at the commencement of the\r\nEocene period. In the Eocene strata of North America occur numerous\r\nplants belonging to existing types--such as Palms, Conifers,\r\nthe Magnolia, Cinnamon, Fig. Dog-wood, Maple, Hickory, Poplar,\r\nPlane, &c. Taken as a whole, the Eocene flora of North America\r\nis nearly related to that of the Miocene strata of Europe, as\r\nwell as to that now existing in the American area. We conclude,\r\ntherefore, that \"the forests of the American Eocene resembled\r\nthose of the European Miocene, and even of modern America\" (Dana).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213.--_Napadites ellipticus_, the fruit of\r\na fossil Palm. London Clay, Isle of Sheppey.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the _animals_ of the Eocene period, the _Protozoans_\r\nare represented by numerous _Foraminifera_, which reach here their\r\nmaximum of development, both as regards the size of individuals and\r\nthe number of generic types. Many of the Eocene Foraminifers are of\r\nsmall size; but even these not uncommonly form whole rock-masses.\r\nThus, the so-called \"Miliolite Limestone\" of the Paris basin, largely\r\nused as a building-stone, is almost wholly composed of the shells\r\nof a small species of _Miliola_. The most remarkable, however, of\r\nthe many members of this group of animals which flourished in\r\nEocene times, are the \"Nummulites\" (_Nummulina_), so called from\r\ntheir resemblance in shape to coins (Lat. _nummus_, a coin). The\r\nNummulites are amongst the largest of all known _Foraminifera_,\r\nsometimes attaining a size of three inches in circumference;\r\nand their internal structure is very complex (fig. 214). Many\r\nspecies are known, and they are particularly characteristic of\r\nthe Middle and Upper of these periods--their place being sometimes\r\ntaken by _Orbitoides_, a form very similar to the Nummulite in\r\nexternal appearance, but differing in its internal details. In\r\nthe Middle Eocene, the remains of Nummulites are found in vast\r\nnumbers in a very widely-spread and easily-recognised formation\r\nknown as the \"Nummulitic Limestone\" (fig. 10). According to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, \"the Nummulitic Limestone of the Swiss Alps rises\r\nto more than 10,000 feet above the level of the sea, and attains\r\nhere and in other mountain-chains a thickness of several thousand\r\nfeet. It may be said to play a far more conspicuous part than\r\nany other Tertiary group in the solid framework of the earth's\r\ncrust, whether in Europe, Asia, or Africa. It occurs in Algeria\r\nand Morocco, and has been traced from Egypt, where it was largely\r\nquarried of old for the building of the Pyramids, into Asia Minor,\r\nand across Persia by Bagdad to the mouths of the Indus. It has\r\nbeen observed not only in Cutch, but in the mountain-ranges which\r\nseparate Scinde from Persia, and which form the passes leading\r\nto Cabul; and it has been followed still further eastward into\r\nIndia, as far as Eastern Bengal and the frontiers of China.\"\r\nThe shells of Nummulites have been found at an elevation of 16,500\r\nfeet above the level of the sea in Western Thibet; and the\r\ndistinguished and philosophical geologist just quoted, further\r\nremarks, that \"when we have once arrived at the conviction that\r\nthe Nummulitic formation occupies a middle and upper place in the\r\nEocene series, we are struck with the comparatively modern date to\r\nwhich some of the greatest revolutions in the physical geography\r\nof Europe, Asia, and Northern Africa must be referred. All the\r\nmountain-chains--such as the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and\r\nHimalayas--into the composition of whose central and loftiest parts\r\nthe Nummulitic strata enter bodily, could have had no existence\r\ntill after the Middle Eocene period. During that period, the\r\nsea prevailed where these chains now rise; for Nummulites and\r\ntheir accompanying Testacea were unquestionably inhabitants of\r\nsalt water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214.--_Nummulina loevigata_. Middle Eocene.]\r\n\r\nThe _Coelenterates_ of the Eocene are represented principally\r\nby _Corals_, mostly of types identical with or nearly allied to\r\nthose now in existence. Perhaps the most characteristic group\r\nof these is that of the _Turbinolidoe_, comprising a number of\r\nsimple \"cup-corals,\" which probably lived in moderately deep\r\nwater. One of the forms belonging to this family is here figured\r\n(fig. 215). Besides true Corals, the Eocene deposits have yielded\r\nthe remains of the \"Sea-pens\" (_Pennatulidoe_) and the branched\r\nskeletons of the \"Sea-shrubs\" (_Gorgontidoe_).\r\n\r\nThe _Echinoderms_ are represented principally by Sea-urchins, and\r\ndemand nothing more than mention. It is to be observed, however,\r\nthat the great group of the Sea-lilies (_Crinoids_) is now verging\r\non extinction, and is but very feebly represented.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Mollusca_, the _Polyzoans_ and _Brachiopods_ also\r\nrequire no special mention, beyond the fact that the latter are\r\ngreatly reduced in numbers, and belong principally to the existing\r\ngenera _Terebratula_ and _Rhynchonella_. The Bivalves\r\n(_Lamellibranchs_) and the Univalves (_Gasteropods_) are exceedingly\r\nnumerous, and almost all the principal existing genera are now\r\nrepresented; though less than five percent of the Eocene _species_\r\nare identical with those now living. It is difficult to make any\r\nselection from the many Bivalves which are known in deposits of\r\nthis age; but species of _Cardita, Crassatella, Leda, Cyrena, Mactra,\r\nCardium, Psammobia_, &c., may be mentioned as very characteristic.\r\nThe _Caradita planicosta_ here figured (fig. 216) is not only very\r\nabundant in the Middle Eocene, but is very widely distributed,\r\nranging from Europe to the Pacific coast of North America. The\r\n_Univalves_ of the Eocene are extremely numerous, and generally\r\nbeautifully preserved. The majority of them belong to that great\r\nsection of the _Gasteropods_ in which the mouth of the shell\r\nis notched or produced into a canal (when the shell is said to be\r\n\"siphonostomatous\")--this section including the carnivorous and\r\nmost highly-organized groups of the class. Not only is this the\r\ncase, but a large number of the Eocene Univalves belong to types\r\nwhich now attain their maximum of development in the warmer regions\r\nof the globe. Thus we find numerous species of Cones (_Conus_),\r\nVolutes (_Voluta_), Cowries (_Cyproea_, fig. 218), Olives and\r\nRice-shells (_Oliva_), Mitre-shells (_Mitra_), Trumpet-shells\r\n(_Triton_), Auger-shells (_Terebra_), and Fig-shells (_Pyrula_).\r\nAlong with these are many forms of _Pleurotoma, Rostellaria_,\r\nSpindle-shells (_Fusus_), Dog-whelks (_Nassa_), _Murices_, and\r\nmany round-mouthed (\"holostomatous\") species, belonging to such\r\ngenera as _Turritella, Nerita, Natica, Scalaria_, &c. The genus\r\n_Cerithium_ (fig. 219), most of the living forms of which are found\r\nin warm regions, inhabiting fresh or brackish waters, undergoes a\r\nvast development in the Eocene period, where it is represented\r\nby an immense number of specific forms, some of which attain\r\nvery large dimensions. In the Eocene strata of the Paris basin\r\nalone, nearly one hundred and fifty species of this genus have been\r\ndetected. The more strictly fresh-water deposits of the Eocene\r\nperiod have also yielded numerous remains of Univalves such as\r\nare now proper to rivers and lakes, together with the shells of\r\ntrue Land-snails. Amongst these may be mentioned numerous species\r\nof _Limnoea_ (fig. 220), _Physa_ (fig. 221), _Melania, Paludina,\r\nPlanorbis, Helix, Bulimus_, and _Cyclostoma_ (fig. 222).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215.--_Turbinolia sulcata_, viewed from one\r\nside, and from above. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216.--_Cardita planicosta_. Middle Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 217.--_Typhis tubifer_, a \"siphonostomatous\"\r\nUnivalve. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218.--Cyproea elegans. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 219.--_Cerithium hexagonum_. Eocene.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _Cephalopods_, the chief point to be noticed\r\nis, that all the beautiful and complex forms which peculiarly\r\ncharacterised the Cretaceous period have here disappeared. We no\r\nlonger meet with a single example of the Turrilite, the Baculite,\r\nthe Hamite, the Scaphite, or the Ammonite. The only exception\r\nto this statement is the occurrence of one species of Ammonite\r\nin the so-called \"Lignitic Formation\" of North America; but the\r\nbeds containing this may possibly be rather referable to the\r\nCretaceous--and this exception does not affect the fact that\r\nthe _Ammonitidoe_, as a family, had become extinct before the\r\nEocene strata were deposited. The ancient genus _Nautilus_ still\r\nsurvives, the sole representative of the once mighty order of the\r\nTetrabranchiate Cephalopods. In the order of the _Dibranchiates_,\r\nwe have a like phenomenon to observe in the total extinction\r\nof the great family of the \"Belemnites.\" No form referable to\r\nthis group has hitherto been found in any Tertiary stratum; but\r\nthe internal skeletons of Cuttle-fishes (such as _Belosepia_)\r\nare not unknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220.--_Limnoea pyramidalis_. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221.--_Physa columnaris_. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222.--_Cyclostoma Arnoudii_. Eocene.]\r\n\r\nRemains of _Fishes_ are very abundant in strata of Eocene age,\r\nespecially in certain localities. The most famous depot for the\r\nfossil fishes of this period is the limestone of Monte Bolca,\r\nnear Verona, which is interstratified with beds of volcanic ashes,\r\nthe whole being referable to the Middle Eocene. The fishes here\r\nseem to have been suddenly destroyed by a volcanic eruption,\r\nand are found in vast numbers. Agassiz has described over one\r\nhundred and thirty species of Fishes from this locality, belonging\r\nto seventy-seven genera. All the _species_ are extinct; but about\r\none-half of the _genera_ are represented by living forms. The\r\ngreat majority of the Eocene Fishes belong to the order of the\r\n\"Bony Fishes\" (_Teleosteans_), so that in the main the forms\r\nof Fishes characterising the Eocene are similar to those which\r\npredominate in existing seas. In addition to the above, a few\r\n_Ganoids_ and a large number of _Placoids_ are known to occur\r\nin the Eocene rocks. Amongst the latter are found numerous teeth\r\nof true Sharks, such as _Otodus_ (fig. 224) and _Carcharodon_.\r\nThe pointed and serrated teeth of the latter sometimes attain\r\na length of over half a foot, indicating that these predaceous\r\nfishes attained gigantic dimensions; and it is interesting to\r\nnote that teeth, in external appearance very similar to those\r\nof the early Tertiary genus _Carcharodon_, have been dredged\r\nfrom great depths during the recent expedition of the Challenger.\r\nThere also occur not uncommonly the flattened teeth of Rays (fig.\r\n225), consisting of flat bony pieces placed close together, and\r\nforming \"a kind of mosaic pavement on both the upper and lower\r\njaws\" (Owen).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223.--_Rhombus minimus_, a small fossil Turbot\r\nfrom the Eocene Tertiary, Monte Bolca.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224.--Tooth of _Otodus obliquus_. Eocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225.--Flattened dental plates of a Ray\r\n(_Myliobatis Edwardsii_). Eocene.]\r\n\r\nIn the class of the _Reptiles_, the disappearance of the\r\ncharacteristic Mesozoic types is as marked a phenomenon as the\r\nintroduction of new forms. The Ichthyosaurs, the Plesiosaurs,\r\nthe Pterosaurs, and the Mosasaurs of the Mesozoic, find no\r\nrepresentatives in the Eocene Tertiary; and the same is true of the\r\nDeinosaurs, if we except a few remains from the doubtfully-situated\r\n\"Lignitic formation\" of the United States, On the other hand, all\r\nthe modern orders of Reptiles are known to have existed during\r\nthe Eocene period. The _Chelonians_ are represented by true marine\r\nTurtles, by \"Terrapins\" (_Emydidoe_), and by \"Soft Tortoises\"\r\n(_Trionycidoe_). The order of the Snakes and Serpents (_Ophidia_)\r\nmakes its appearance here, for the first time under several\r\nforms--all of which, however, are referable to the non-venomous\r\ngroup of the \"Constricting Serpents\" (_Boidoe_). The oldest of\r\nthese is the _Paloeophis toliapicus_ of the London Clay of Sheppey,\r\nfirst made known to science by the researches of Professor Owen.\r\nThe nearly-allied _Paloeophis typhoeus_ of the Eocene beds of\r\nBracklesham appears to have been a Boa-constrictor-like Snake\r\nof about twenty feet in length. Similar Python-like Snakes\r\n(_Paloeophis, Dinophis_, &c.) have been described from the Eocene\r\ndeposits of the United States. True Lizards (_Lacertilians_)\r\nare found in some abundance in the Eocene deposits,--some being\r\nsmall terrestrial forms, like the common European lizards of the\r\npresent day; whilst others equal or exceed the living Monitors\r\nin size. Lastly, the modern order of the _Crocodilia_ is largely\r\nrepresented in Eocene times, by species belonging to all the\r\nexisting genera, together with others referable to extinct types.\r\nAs pointed out by Owen, it is an interesting fact that in the\r\nEocene rocks of the south-west of England, there occur fossil\r\nremains of all the three living types of Crocodilians--namely, the\r\nGavials, the true Crocodiles, and the Alligators (fig. 226)--though\r\nat the present day these forms are all geographically restricted\r\nin their range, and are never associated together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226.--Upper jaw of Alligator. Eocene Tertiary,\r\nIsle of Wight.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all the existing orders of _Birds_, if not all, are\r\nrepresented in the Eocene deposits by remains often very closely\r\nallied to existing types. Thus, amongst the Swimming Birds\r\n(_Natatores_) we find examples of forms allied to the living\r\nPelicans and Mergansers; amongst the Waders (_Grallatores_) we\r\nhave birds resembling the Ibis (the _Numenius gypsorum_ of the\r\nParis basin); amongst the Running Birds (_Cursores_) we meet with\r\nthe great _Gastornis Parisiensis_, which equalled the African\r\nOstrich in height, and the still more gigantic _Dasornis\r\nLondinensis_; remains of a Partridge represent the Scratching\r\nBirds (_Rasores_); the American Eocene has yielded the bones of\r\none of the Climbing Birds (_Scansores_), apparently referable\r\nto the Woodpeckers; the _Protornis Glarisiensis_ of the Eocene\r\nSchists of Glaris is the oldest known example of the Perching\r\nBirds (_Insessores_); and the Birds of Prey (_Raptores_) are\r\nrepresented by Vultures, Owls, and Hawks. The toothed Birds of\r\nthe Upper Cretaceous are no longer known to exist; but Professor\r\nOwen has recently described from the London Clay the skull of a very\r\nremarkable Bird, in which there is, at any rate, an approximation\r\nto the structure of _Ichthyornis_ and _Hesperornis_. The bird\r\nin question has been named the _Odontopteryx totiapicus_, its\r\ngeneric title being derived from the very remarkable characters\r\nof its jaws. In this singular form (fig. 227) the margins of\r\nboth jaws are furnished with tooth-like denticulations, which\r\ndiffer from true teeth in being actually portions of the bony\r\nsubstance of the jaw itself, with which they are continuous, and\r\nwhich were probably encased by extensions of the horny sheath\r\nof the bill. These tooth-like processes are of two sizes, the\r\nlarger ones being comparable to canines; and they are all directed\r\nforwards, and have a triangular or compressed conical form. From\r\na careful consideration of all the discovered remains of this\r\nbird, Professor Owen concludes that \"_Odontopteryx_ was a\r\nwarm-blooded feathered biped, with wings; and further, that it\r\nwas web-footed and a fish-eater, and that in the catching of\r\nits slippery prey it was assisted by this Pterosauroid armature\r\nof its jaws.\" Upon the whole, _Odontopteryx_ would appear to be\r\nmost nearly related to the family of the Geese (_Anserinoe_)\r\nor Ducks (_Anatidoe_); but the extension of the bony substance\r\nof the jaws into tooth-like processes is an entirely unique\r\ncharacter, in which it stands quite alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227.--Skull of _Odontopteryx toliapicus restored.\r\n(After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nThe known _Mammals_ of the Mesozoic period, as we have seen,\r\nare all of small size; and with one not unequivocal exception,\r\nthey appear to be referable to the order of the Pouched Quadrupeds\r\n(_Marsupials_), almost the lowest group of the whole class of\r\nthe Mammalia. In the Eocene rocks, on the other hand, numerous\r\nremains of Quadrupeds have been brought to light, representing\r\nmost of the great Mammalian orders now in existence upon the\r\nearth, and in many cases indicating animals of very considerable\r\ndimensions. We are, in fact, in a position to assert that the\r\nmajority of the great groups of Quadrupeds with which we are\r\nfamiliar at the present day were already in existence in the\r\nEocene period, and that their ancient root-stocks were even in\r\nthis early time separated by most of the fundamental differences\r\nof structure which distinguish their living representatives.\r\nAt the same time, there are some amongst the Eocene quadrupeds\r\nwhich have a \"generalised\" character, and which may be regarded\r\nas structural types standing midway between groups now sharply\r\nseparated from one another.\r\n\r\nThe order of the _Marsupials_--including the existing Kangaroos,\r\nWombats, Opossums, Phalangers, &c.--is poorly represented in\r\ndeposits of Eocene age. The most celebrated example of this group\r\nis the _Didelphys gypsorum_ of the Gypseous beds of Montmartre,\r\nnear Paris, an Opossum very nearly allied to the living Opossums\r\nof North and South America.\r\n\r\nNo member of the _Edenates_ (Sloths, Ant-eaters, and Armadillos)\r\nhas hitherto been detected in any Eocene deposit. The aquatic order\r\nof the _Sirenians_ (Dugongs and Manatees), with their fish-like\r\nbodies and tails, paddle-shaped forelimbs, and wholly deficient\r\nhind-limbs, are represented in strata of this age by remains of\r\nthe ancient \"Sea-Cows,\" to which the name of _Halitherium_ has\r\nbeen applied. Nearly allied to the preceding is the likewise aquatic\r\norder of the Whales and Dolphins (_Cetaceans_), in which the body\r\nis also fish-like, the hind-limbs are wanting, the fore-limbs are\r\nconverted into powerful \"flippers\" or swimming-paddles, and the\r\nterminal extremity of the body is furnished with a horizontal,\r\ntail-fin. Many existing Cetaceans (such as the Whalebone Whales)\r\nhave no true teeth; but others (Dolphins, Porpoises, Sperm Whales)\r\npossess simple conical teeth. In strata of Eocene age, however, we\r\nfind a singular group of Whales, constituting the genus _Zeuglodon\r\n(fig. 228), in which the teeth differed from those of all existing\r\nforms in being of two kinds,--the front ones being conical incisors,\r\nwhilst the back teeth or molars have serrated triangular crowns,\r\nand are inserted in the jaw by two roots. Each molar (fig. 228,\r\nA) looks as if it were composed of two separate teeth united on\r\none side by their crowns; and it is this peculiarity which is\r\nexpressed by the generic name (Gr. _zeugle_, a yoke; _odous_,\r\ntooth). The best-known species of the genus is the _Zeuglodon\r\ncetoides_ of Owen, which attained a length of seventy feet. Remains\r\nof these gigantic Whales are very common in the \"Jackson Beds\" of\r\nthe Southern United States. So common are they that, according\r\nto Dana, \"the large vertebræ, some of them a foot and a half\r\nlong and a foot in diameter, were formerly so abundant over the\r\ncountry, in Alabama, that they were used for making walls, or\r\nwere burned to rid the fields of them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 228.--_Zeuglodon cetoides_. A, Molar tooth of\r\nthe natural size; B, Vertebra, reduced in size. From the Middle\r\nEocene of the United States. (After Lyell.)]\r\n\r\nThe great and important order of the Hoofed Quadrupeds (_Ungulata_)\r\nis represented in the Eocene by examples of both of its two principal\r\nsections--namely, those with an uneven number of toes (one or three)\r\non the foot (_Perissodactyle Ungulates_), and those with an even\r\nnumber of toes (two or four) to each foot (_Artiodactyle Ungulates_).\r\nAmongst the Odd-toed Ungulates, the living family of the Tapirs\r\n(_Tapirdoe_) is represented by the genus _Coryphodon_ of Owen.\r\nNearly related to the preceding are the species of _Paloeotherium_,\r\nwhich have a historical interest as being amongst the first of\r\nthe Tertiary Mammals investigated by the illustrious Cuvier.\r\nSeveral species of _Paloeothere_ are known, varying greatly in\r\nsize, the smallest being little bigger than a hare, whilst the\r\nlargest must have equalled a good-sized horse in its dimensions. The\r\nspecies of _Paloeotherium_ appear to have agreed with the existing\r\nTapirs in possessing a lengthened and flexible nose, which formed\r\na short proboscis or trunk (fig. 229), suitable as an instrument\r\nfor stripping off the foliage of trees--the characters of the\r\nmolar teeth showing them to have been strictly herbivorous in\r\ntheir habits. They differ, however, from the Tapirs, amongst\r\nother characters, in the fact that both the fore and the hind\r\nfeet possessed three toes each; whereas in the latter there are\r\nfour toes on each fore-foot, and the hind-feet alone are three-toed.\r\nThe remains of _Paloeotheria_ have been found in such abundance in\r\ncertain localities as to show that these animals roamed in great\r\nherds over the fertile plains of France and the south of England\r\nduring the later portion of the Eocene period. The accompanying\r\nillustration (fig. 229) represents the notion which the great\r\nCuvier was induced by his researches to form as to the outward\r\nappearance of _Paloeotherium magnum_. Recent discoveries, however,\r\nhave rendered it probable that this restoration is in some important\r\nrespects inaccurate. Instead of being bulky, massive, and more\r\nor less resembling the living Tapirs in form, it would rather\r\nappear that _Paloeotherium magnum_ was in reality a slender,\r\ngraceful, and long-necked animal, more closely resembling in\r\ngeneral figure a Llama, or certain of the Antelopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229.--Outline of _Paloeotherium magnum_,\r\nrestored. Upper Eocene, Europe. (After Cuvier.)]\r\n\r\nThe singular genus _Anchitherium_ forms a kind of transition\r\nbetween the _Paloeotheria_ and the true Horses (_Equidoe_). The\r\nHorse (fig. 230, D) possesses but one fully-developed toe to\r\neach foot, this being terminated by a single broad hoof, and\r\nrepresenting the _middle_ toe--the _third_ of the typical\r\nfive-fingered or five-toed limb of Quadrupeds in general. In\r\naddition, however, to this fully-developed toe, each foot in the\r\nhorse carries two rudimentary toes which are concealed beneath the\r\nskin, and are known as the \"splint-bones.\" These are respectively\r\nthe _second_ and _fourth_ toes, in an aborted condition; and the\r\nfirst and fifth toes are wholly wanting. In _Hipparion_ (fig.\r\n230, C), the foot is essentially like that of the modern Horses,\r\nexcept that the second and fourth toes no longer are mere\r\n\"splint-bones,\" hidden beneath the skin; but have now little\r\nhoofs, and hang freely, but uselessly, by the side of the great\r\nmiddle toe, not being sufficiently developed to reach the ground.\r\nIn _Anchitherium_, again (fig. 230, B), the foot is three-toed,\r\nlike that of _Hipparion_; but the two lateral toes (the second\r\nand fourth) are so far developed that they now reach the ground.\r\nThe _first_ digit (thumb or great toe) is still wanting; as also\r\nis the _fifth_ digit (little finger or little toe). Lastly, the\r\nEocene rocks have yielded in North America the remains of a small\r\nEquine quadruped, to which Marsh has given the name of _Orohippus_.\r\nIn this singular form--which was not larger than a fox--the foot\r\n(fig. 230, A) carries _four_ toes, all of which are hoofed and touch\r\nthe ground, but of which the _third_ toe is still the largest. The\r\n_first_ toe (thumb or great toe) is still wanting; but in this\r\nancient representative of the Horses, the _fifth_ or \"little\"\r\ntoe appears for the first time. As all the above-mentioned forms\r\nsucceed one another in point of time, it may be regarded as probable\r\nthat we shall yet be able to point, with some certainty, to some\r\nstill older example of the _Equidoe_, in which the first digit\r\nis developed, and the foot assumes its typical five-fingered\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230.--Skeleton of the foot in various forms\r\nbelonging to the family of the _Equidoe_. A, Foot of _Orohippus_,\r\nEocene; B, Foot of _Anchitherium</>, Upper Eocene and Lower Miocene;\r\nC, Foot of _Hipparion_, Upper Miocene and Pliocene: D, Foot of\r\nHorse (_Equus_), Pliocene and Recent. The figures indicate the\r\nnumbers of the digits in the typical five-fingered hand of Mammals.\r\n(After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nPassing on to the Even-toed or _Artiodactyle Ungulates_, no\r\nrepresentative of the _Hippotamus_ seems yet to have existed, but\r\nthere are several forms (_Choeropotamus, Hyopotamus_, &c.) more\r\nor less closely allied to the Pigs (_Suida_); and the singular\r\ngroup of the _Anoplotheridoe_ may be regarded as forming a kind of\r\ntransition between the Swine and the Ruminants. The _Anoplotheria_\r\n(fig. 231) were slender in form, the largest not exceeding a\r\ndonkey in size, with long tails, and having the feet terminated\r\nby two hoofed toes each, sometimes with a pair of small accessory\r\nhoofs as well. The teeth exhibit the peculiarity that they are\r\narranged in a continuous series, without any gap or interval\r\nbetween the molars and the canines; and the back teeth, like\r\nthose of all the Ungulates, are adapted for grinding vegetable\r\nfood, their crowns resembling in form those of the true Ruminants.\r\nThe genera _Dichobune_ and _Xiphodon_, of the Middle and Upper\r\nEocene, are closely related to _Anoplotherium_, but are more\r\nslender and deer-like in form. No example of the great Ruminant\r\ngroup of the Ungulate Quadrupeds has as yet been detected in\r\ndeposits of Eocene age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231.--_Anoplotherium commune_. Eocene Tertiary,\r\nFrance. (After Cuvier.)]\r\n\r\nWhilst true Ruminants appear to be unknown, the Eocene strata\r\nof North America have yielded to the researches of Professor\r\nMarsh examples of an extraordinary group (_Dinocerata_), which\r\nmay be considered as in some respects intermediate between the\r\nUngulates and the Proboscideans. In _Dinoceras_ itself (fig.\r\n232) we have a large animal, equal in dimensions to the living\r\nElephants, which it further resembles in the structure of the\r\nmassive limbs, except that there are only four toes to each foot.\r\nThe upper jaw was devoid of front teeth, but there were two very\r\nlarge canine teeth, in the form of tusks directed perpendicularly\r\ndownwards; and there was also a series of six small molars on each.\r\nEach upper jaw-bone carried a bony projection, which was probably\r\nof the nature of a \"horn-core,\" and was originally sheathed in\r\nhorn. Two similar, but smaller, horn-cores are carried on the\r\nnasal bones; and two much larger projections, also probably of\r\nthe nature of horn-cores, were carried upon the forehead. We may\r\nthus infer that _Dinoceras_ possessed three pairs of horns, all\r\nof which resembled the horns of the Sheep and Oxen in consisting\r\nof a central bony \"core,\" surrounded by a horny sheath. The nose\r\nwas not prolonged into a proboscis or \"trunk,\" as in the existing\r\nElephants; and the tail was short and slender. Many forms of\r\nthe _Dinocerata_ are known; but all these singular and gigantic\r\nquadrupeds appear to have been confined to the North American\r\ncontinent, and to be restricted to the Eocene period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232.--Skull of _Dinoceras mirabilis_, greatly\r\nreduced. Eocene, North America. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe important order of the Elephants (_Proboscidea_) is also not\r\nknown to have come into existence during the Eocene period. On the\r\nother hand, the great order of the Beasts of Prey (_Carnivora_)\r\nis represented in Eocene strata by several forms belonging to\r\ndifferent types. Thus the _Ardocyon_ presents us with an Eocene\r\nCarnivore more or less closely allied to the existing Racoons;\r\nthe _Paloeonyctis_ appears to be related to the recent Civet-cats;\r\nthe genus _Hyoenodon_ is in some respects comparable to the living\r\nHyænas; and the _Canis Parisiensis_ of the gypsum-bearing beds\r\nof Montmartre may perhaps be allied to the Foxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233.--Portion of the skeleton of _Vespertilio\r\nParisienis_. Eocene Tertiary, France.]\r\n\r\nThe order of the Bats (_Cheiroptera_) is represented in Eocene\r\nstrata of the Paris basin (Gypseous series of Montmartre) by\r\nthe _Vespertilio Parisiensis_ (fig. 233), an insect-eating Bat\r\nvery similar to some of the existing European forms. Lastly, the\r\nEocene deposits have yielded more or less satisfactory evidence\r\nof the existence in Europe at this period of examples of the\r\norders of the Gnawing Mammals (_Rodentia_), the Insect-eating\r\nMammals (_Insectivora_), and the Monkeys (_Quadrumana_).[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: A short list of the more important works relating to\r\nthe Eocene rocks and fossils will be given after all the Tertiary\r\ndeposits have been treated of.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE MIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene rocks comprise those Tertiary deposits which contain\r\nless than about 35 per cent of existing species of shells\r\n(_Mollusca_), and more than 5 per cent--or those deposits in\r\nwhich the proportion of living shells is less than of extinct\r\nspecies. They are divisible into a _Lower Miocene_ (_Oligocene_)\r\nand an _Upper Miocene_ series.\r\n\r\nIn _Britain_, the Miocene rocks are very poorly developed, one\r\nof their leading developments being at Bovey Tracy in Devonshire,\r\nwhere there occur sands, clays, and beds of lignite or imperfect\r\ncoal. These strata contain numerous plants, amongst which are\r\nVines, Figs, the Cinnamon-tree, Palms, and many Conifers, especially\r\nthose belonging to the genus Sequoia (the \"Red-Foods\"). These\r\nBovey Tracy lignites are of Lower Miocene age, and they are\r\nlacustrine in origin. Also of Lower Miocene age are the so-called\r\n\"Hempstead Beds\" of Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight. These attain a\r\nthickness of less than 200 feet, and are shown by their numerous\r\nfossils to be principally a true marine formation. Lastly, the\r\nDuke of Argyll, in 1851, showed that there existed at Ardtun, in\r\nthe island of Mull, certain Tertiary strata containing numerous\r\nremains of plants; and these also are now regarded as belonging\r\nto the Lower Miocene.\r\n\r\nIn _France_, the Lower Miocene is represented in Auvergne, Cantal,\r\nand Velay, by a great thickness of nearly horizontal strata of\r\nsands, sandstone, clays, marls, and limestones, the whole of\r\nfresh-water origin. The principal fossils of these lacustrine\r\ndeposits are _Mammalia_, of which the remains occur in great\r\nabundance. In the valley of the Loire occur the typical European\r\ndeposits of Upper Miocene age. These are known as the \"Faluns,\"\r\nfrom a provincial term applied to shelly sands, employed to spread\r\nupon soils which are deficient in lime; and the Upper Miocene\r\nis hence sometimes spoken of as the \"Falunian\" formation. The\r\nFaluns occur in scattered patches, which are rarely more than 50\r\nfeet in thickness, and consist of sands and marls. The fossils\r\nare chiefly marine; but there occur also land and fresh-water\r\nshells, together with the remains of numerous Mammals. About 25\r\nper cent of the shells of the Faluns are identical with existing\r\nspecies. The sands, limestones, and marls of the Department of\r\nGers, near the base of the Pyrenees, rendered famous by the number\r\nor Mammalian remains exhumed from them by M. Lartet, also belong\r\nto the age of the Faluns.\r\n\r\nIn _Switzerland_, between the Alps and the Jura, there occurs\r\na great series of Miocene deposits, known collectively as the\r\n\"Molasse,\" from the soft nature of a greenish sandstone, which\r\nconstitutes one of its chief members. It attains a thickness of\r\nmany thousands of feet, and rises into lofty mountains, some\r\nof which--as the Rigi--are more than 6000 feet in height. The\r\nmiddle portion of the Molasse is of marine origin, and is shown\r\nby its fossils to be of the age of the Faluns; but the lower\r\nand upper portions of the formation are mainly or entirely of\r\nfresh-water origin. The Lower Molasse (of Lower Miocene age)\r\nhas yielded about 500 species of plants, mostly of tropical or\r\nsub-tropical forms. The Upper Molasse has yielded about the same\r\nnumber of plants, with about 900 species of Insects, such as\r\nwood-eating Beetles Water-beetles, White Ants, Dragon-flies, &c.\r\n\r\nIn _Belgium_, strata of both Lower and Upper Miocene age are\r\nknown,--the former (_Rupelian Clays_) containing numerous marine\r\nfossils; whilst the latter (_Bolderberg Sands_) have yielded\r\nnumerous shells corresponding with those of the Faluns.\r\n\r\nIn _Austria_, Miocene strata are largely developed, marine beds\r\nbelonging to both the Lower and Upper division of the formation\r\noccurring extensively in the Vienna basin. The well-known Brown\r\nCoals of Radaboj, in Croatia, with numerous plants and insects,\r\nare also of Lower Miocene age.\r\n\r\nIn _Germany_, deposits belonging to both the Lower and Upper\r\ndivision of the Miocene formation are extensively developed.\r\nTo the former belong the marine strata of the Mayence basin,\r\nand the marine _Rupelian Clay_ near Berlin; whilst a celebrated\r\ngroup of strata belonging to the Upper Miocene occurs near\r\nEpplesheim, in Hesse-Darmstadt, and is well known for the number\r\nof its Mammalian remains.\r\n\r\nIn _Greece_, at Pikermé, near Athens, there occurs a celebrated\r\ndeposit of Upper Miocene age, well known to palæontologists through\r\nthe researches of M. M. Wagner, Roth, and Gaudry upon the numerous\r\nMammalia which it contains. In _Italy_, also, strata of both Lower\r\nand Upper Miocene age are well developed in the neighbourhood\r\nof Turin.\r\n\r\nIn the _Siwâlik Hills_, in India, at the southern foot of the\r\nHimalayas, occurs a series of Upper Miocene strata, which have\r\nbecome widely celebrated through the researches of Dr Falconer\r\nand Sir Proby Cautley upon the numerous remains of Mammals and\r\nReptiles which they contain. Beds of corresponding age, with\r\nsimilar fossils, are known to occur in the island of Perim in\r\nthe Gulf of Cambay.\r\n\r\nLastly, Miocene deposits are found in _North America_, in New\r\nJersey, Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, California, Oregon, &c.,\r\nattaining a thickness of 1500 feet or more. They consist principally\r\nof clays, sands, and sandstones, sometimes of marine and sometimes\r\nof fresh-water origin. Near Richmond, in Virginia, there occurs a\r\nremarkable stratum, wrongly called \"Infusorial Earth,\" which is\r\noccasionally 30 feet in thickness, and consists almost wholly of\r\nthe siliceous envelopes of certain low forms of plants (Diatoms),\r\nalong with the spicules of Sponges and other siliceous organisms\r\n(see fig. 16). The _White River Group_ of Hayden occurs in the\r\nUpper Missouri region, and is largely exposed over the barren\r\nand desolate district known as the \"Mauvaises Terres.\" They have\r\na thickness of 1000 feet or more, and contain numerous remains\r\nof Mammals. They are of lacustrine origin, and are believed to\r\nbe of the age of the Lower Miocene. Upon the whole, about from\r\n15 to 30 per cent of the _Mollusca_ of the American Miocene are\r\nidentical with existing species.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regions previously enumerated, Miocene strata\r\nare known to be developed in _Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen_,\r\nand in other areas of less importance.\r\n\r\nThe _life_ of the Miocene period is extremely abundant, and, from\r\nthe nature of the deposits of this age, also extremely varied\r\nin its character. The marine beds of the formation have yielded\r\nnumerous remains of both Vertebrate and Invertebrate sea-animals;\r\nwhilst the fresh-water deposits contain the skeletons of such\r\nshells, fishes, &c., as now inhabit rivers or lakes. Both the\r\nmarine and the lacustrine beds have been shown to contain an\r\nenormous number of plants, the latter more particularly; whilst\r\nthe Brown Coals of the formation are made up of vegetable matter\r\nlittle altered from its original condition. The remains of\r\nair-breathing animals, such as Insects, Reptiles, Birds, and\r\nMammals, are also abundantly found, more especially in the\r\nfresh-water beds.\r\n\r\nThe _plants_ of the Miocene period are extraordinarily numerous,\r\nand only some of the general features of the vegetation of this\r\nepoch can be indicated here. Our chief sources of information as\r\nto the Miocene plants are the Brown Coals of Germany and Austria,\r\nthe Lower and Upper Molasse of Switzerland, and the Miocene strata\r\nof the Arctic regions. The lignites of Austria have yielded very\r\nnumerous plants, chiefly of a tropical character--one of the\r\nmost noticeable forms being a Palm of the genus _Sabal_ (fig.\r\n234, B), now found in America. The plants of the Lower Miocene of\r\nSwitzerland are also mostly of a tropical character, but include\r\nseveral forms now found in North America, such as a Tulip-tree\r\n(_Liriodendron_) and a Cypress (_Taxodium_). Amongst the more\r\nremarkable forms from these beds may be mentioned Fan-Palms\r\n(_Chamoerops_, fig 234, A), numerous tropical ferns, and two\r\nspecies of Cinnamon. The plant-remains of the Upper Molasse of\r\nSwitzerland indicate an extraordinarily rank and luxuriant\r\nvegetation, composed mainly of plants which now live in warm\r\ncountries. Among the commoner plants of this formation may be\r\nenumerated many species of Maple (_Acer_), Plane-trees (_Platanus_\r\nfig. 235), Cinnamon-trees (fig. 236), and other members of the\r\n_Lauraceoe_, many species of _Proteaccoe_ (_Banksia, Grevillea_,\r\n&c.), several species of Sarsaparilla (_Smilax_), Palms, Cypresses,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234.--Miocene Palms A, _Chamoerops Helvetica_;\r\nB, _Sabal major_. Lower Miocene of Switzerland and France.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235.--_Platanus aceroides_, an Upper Miocene\r\nPlane-tree. a, Leaf; b, The core of a bundle of fruits; c,\r\nA single fruit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 236.--_Cinnamomum polymorphum_. a, Leaf;\r\nb, Flower. Upper Miocene.]\r\n\r\nIn Britain, the Lower Miocene strata of Bovey Tracy have yielded\r\nremains of Ferns, Vines, Fig, Cinnamon, _Proteaccoe_, &c., along\r\nwith numerous Conifers. The most abundant of these last is a\r\ngigantic pine--the _Sequoia Couttsioe_--which is very nearly\r\nallied to the huge _Sequoia_ (_Wellingtonia_) _gigantea_ of\r\nCalifornia. A nearly-allied form (_Sequoia Langsdorffi_) has been\r\ndetected in the leaf-bed of Ardtun, in the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nIn Greenland, as well as in other parts of the Arctic regions,\r\nMiocene strata have been discovered which have yielded a great\r\nnumber of plants, many of which are identical with species found\r\nin the European Miocene. Amongst these plants are found many\r\ntrees, such as Conifers, Beeches, Oaks, Maples, Plane-trees,\r\nWalnuts, Magnolias, &c., with numerous shrubs, ferns, and other\r\nsmaller plants. With regard to the Miocene flora of the Arctic\r\nregions, Sir Charles Lyell remarks that \"more than thirty species\r\nof Coniferæ have been found, including several Sequoias (allied\r\nto the gigantic Wellingtonia of California), with species of\r\n_Thujopsis_ and _Salisburia_, now peculiar to Japan. There are\r\nalso beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, maples, walnuts, limes, and\r\neven a magnolia, two cones of which have recently been obtained,\r\nproving that this splendid evergreen not only lived but ripened\r\nits fruit within the Arctic circle. Many of the limes, planes,\r\nand oaks were large-leaved species; and both flowers and fruits,\r\nbesides immense quantities of leaves, are in many cases preserved.\r\nAmong the shrubs are many evergreens, as _Andromeda_, and two\r\nextinct genera, _Daphnogene_ and _M'Clintockia_, with fine leathery\r\nleaves, together with hazel, blackthorn, holly, logwood, and\r\nhawthorn. A species of Zamia (_Zimites_) grew in the swamps,\r\nwith _Potamogeton, Sparganium_, and _Menyanthes_; while ivy and\r\nvilles twined around the forest-trees, and broad-leaved ferns\r\ngrew beneath their shade. Even in Spitzbergen, as far north as\r\nlat. 78° 56', no less than ninety-five species of fossil plants\r\nhave been obtained, including _Taxodium_ of two species, hazel,\r\npoplar, alder, beech, plane-tree, and lime. Such a vigorous growth\r\nof trees within 12° of the pole, where now a dwarf willow and a\r\nfew herbaceous plants form the only vegetation, and where the\r\nground is covered with almost perpetual snow and ice, is truly\r\nremarkable.\"\r\n\r\nTaking the Miocene flora as a whole, Dr Heer concludes from his\r\nstudy of about 3000 plants contained in the European Miocene\r\nalone, that the Miocene plants indicate tropical or sub-tropical\r\nconditions, but that there is a striking inter-mixture of forms\r\nwhich are at present found in countries widely removed from one\r\nanother. It is impossible to state with certainty how many of the\r\nMiocene plants belong to existing species, but it appears that\r\nthe larger number are extinct. According to Heer, the American\r\ntypes of plants are most largely represented in the Miocene flora,\r\nnext those of Europe and Asia, next those of Africa, and lastly\r\nthose of Australia. Upon the whole, however, the Miocene flora\r\nof Europe is mostly nearly allied to the plants which we now\r\nfind inhabiting the warmer parts of the United States; and this\r\nhas led to the suggestion that in Miocene times the Atlantic\r\nOcean was dry land, and that a migration of American plants to\r\nEurope was thus permitted. This view is borne out by the fact\r\nthat the Miocene plants of Europe are most nearly allied to the\r\nliving plants of the eastern or Atlantic seaboard of the United\r\nStates, and also by the occurrence of a rich Miocene flora in\r\nGreenland. As regards Greenland, Dr Heer has determined that\r\nthe Miocene plants indicate a temperate climate in that country,\r\nwith a mean annual temperature at least 30° warmer than it is\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nThe present limit of trees is the isothermal which gives the\r\nmean temperature of 500 Fahr. in July, or about the parallel of\r\n67° N. latitude. In Miocene times, however, the Limes, Cypresses,\r\nand Plane-trees reach the 79th degree of latitude, and the Pines\r\nand Poplars must have ranged even further north than this.\r\n\r\nThe _Invertebrate Animals_ of the Miocene period are very numerous,\r\nbut they belong for the most part to existing types, and they\r\ncan only receive scanty consideration here. The little shells of\r\n_Foraminifera_ are extremely abundant in some beds, the genera\r\nbeing in many cases such as now flourish abundantly in our seas.\r\nThe principal forms belong to the genera _Textularia_ (fig. 237),\r\n_Robulina, Glandulina, Polystomella, Amplistegina_, &c. Corals\r\nare very abundant, in many instances forming regular \"reefs;\"\r\nbut all the more important groups are in existence at the present\r\nday. The Red Coral (_Corallium_), so largely sought after as an\r\nornamental material, appears for the first time in deposits of\r\nthis age. Amongst the _Echinoderms_, we meet with Heart-Urchins\r\n(_Spatangus_), Cake-Urchins (_Scutella_; fig. 238), and various\r\nother forms, the majority of which are closely allied to forms\r\nnow in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237.--_Textularia Meyeriana_, greatly enlarged.\r\nMiocene Tertiary.]\r\n\r\nNumerous Crabs and Lobsters represent the _Crustacea_; but the most\r\nimportant of the Miocene Articulate Animals are the _Insects_. Of\r\nthese, more than thirteen hundred species have been determined by\r\nDr Heer from the Miocene strata of Switzerland alone. They include\r\nalmost all the existing orders of insects, such as numerous and\r\nvaried forms of Beetles (_Coleoptera_), Forest-bugs (_Hemiptera_),\r\nAnts (_Hymenoptera_), Flies (_Diptera_), Termites and Dragon-flies\r\n(_Neuroptera_), Grasshoppers (_Orthoptera_), and Butterflies\r\n(_Lepidoptera_). One of the latter, the well-known _Vanessa Pluto_\r\nof the Brown Coals of Croatia, even exhibits the pattern of the\r\nwing, and to some extent its original coloration; whilst the more\r\ndurably-constructed insects are often in a state of exquisite\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238.--Different views of _Scutella subrotunda_,\r\na Miocene \"Cake-Urchin\" from the south of France.]\r\n\r\nThe _Mollusca_ of the Miocene period are very numerous, but call\r\nfor little special comment. Upon the whole, they are generically\r\nvery similar to the Shell-fish of the present day; whilst, as\r\nbefore stated, from fifteen to thirty per cent of the _species_\r\nare identical with those now in existence. So far as the European\r\narea is concerned, the Molluscs indicate a decidedly hotter climate\r\nthan the present one, though they have not such a distinctly\r\ntropical character as is the case with the Eocene shells. Thus we\r\nmeet with many Cones, Volutes, Cowries, Olive-shells, Fig-shells,\r\nand the like, which are decidedly indicative of a high temperature\r\nof the sea. _Polyzoans_ are abundant, and often attain considerable\r\ndimensions; whilst _Brachiopods_, on the other hand, are few in\r\nnumber. Bivalves and _Univalves_ are extremely plentiful; and\r\nwe meet here with the shells of Winged-Snails (_Pteropods_),\r\nbelonging to such existing genera as _Hyalea_ (fig. 239) and\r\n_Cleodora_. Lastly, the _Cephalopods_ are represented both by\r\nthe chambered shells of _Nautili_ and by the internal skeletons\r\nof Cuttle-fishes (_Spirulirostra_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239.--Different views of the shell of _Hyalea\r\nOrbignyana_, a Miocene Pteropod.]\r\n\r\nThe _Fishes_ of the Miocene Period are very abundant but of little\r\nspecial importance. Besides the remains of Bony Fishes, we meet\r\nin the marine deposits of this age with numerous pointed teeth\r\nbelonging to different kinds of Sharks. Some of the genera of\r\nthese--such as _Carcharodon_ (fig. 241), _Oxyrhina_ (fig. 240),\r\n_Lamna_, and _Galeocerdo_--are very widely distributed, ranging\r\nthrough both the Old and New Worlds; and some of the species\r\nattain gigantic dimensions.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Amphibians_ we meet with distinctly modern types,\r\nsuch as Frogs (_Rana_) and Newts or Salamanders. The most celebrated\r\nof the latter is the famous _Andrias Scheuchzeri_ (fig. 242),\r\ndiscovered in the year 1725 in the fresh-water Miocene deposits\r\nof OEningen, in Switzerland. The skeleton indicates an animal\r\nnearly five feet in length; and it was originally described by\r\nScheuchzer, a Swiss physician, in a dissertation published in 1731,\r\nas the remains of one of the human beings who were in existence\r\nat the time of the Noachian Deluge. Hence he applied to it the\r\nname of _Homo diluvii testis_. In reality, however, as shown by\r\nCuvier, we have here the skeleton of a huge Newt, very closely\r\nallied to the Giant Salamander (_Menopoma maxima_) of Java.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240.--Tooth of _Oxyrhina xiphodon_. Miocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241.--Tooth of _Carcharodon productus_. Miocene.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of _Reptiles_ are far from uncommon in the Miocene\r\nrocks, consisting principally of Chelonians and Crocodilians.\r\nThe Land-tortoises (_Testudinidoe_) make their first appearance\r\nduring this period. The most remarkable form of this group is\r\nthe huge _Colossochelys Atlas_ of the Upper Miocene deposits\r\nof the Siwâlik Hills in India, described by Dr Falconer and Sir\r\nProby Cautley. Far exceeding any living Tortoise in its dimensions,\r\nthis enormous animal is estimated as having had a length of about\r\ntwenty feet, measured from the tip of the snout to the extremity\r\nof the tail, and to have stood upwards of seven feet high. All the\r\ndetails of its organisation, however, prove that it must have been\r\n\"strictly a land animal, with herbivorous habits, and probably\r\nof the most inoffensive nature.\" The accomplished palæontologist\r\njust quoted, shows further that some of the traditions of the\r\nHindoos would render it not improbable that this colossal Tortoise\r\nhad survived into the earlier portion of the human period.\r\n\r\nOf the _Birds_ of the Miocene period it is sufficient to remark\r\nthat though specifically distinct, they belong, so far as known,\r\nwholly to existing groups, and therefore present no points of\r\nspecial palæontological interest.\r\n\r\nThe _Mammals_ of the Miocene are very numerous, and only the more\r\nimportant forms can be here alluded to. Amongst the _Marsupials_,\r\nthe Old World still continued to possess species of Opossum\r\n(_Didephys_), allied to the existing American forms. The _Edentates_\r\n(Sloths, Armadillos, and Ant-eaters), at the present day mainly\r\nSouth American, are represented by two large European forms. One\r\nof these is the large _Macrotherium giganteum_ of the Upper Miocene\r\nof Gers in Southern France, which appears to hare been in many\r\nrespects allied to the existing Scaly Ant-eaters or Pangolins,\r\nat the same time that the disproportionately long fore-limbs would\r\nindicate that it possessed the climbing habits of the Sloths.\r\nThe other is the still more gigantic _Ancylotherium Pentelici_\r\nof the Upper Miocene of Pikermé, which seems to have been as\r\nlarge as, or larger than, the Rhinoceros, and which must have\r\nbeen terrestrial in its habits. This conclusion is further borne\r\nout by the comparative equality of length which subsists between\r\nthe fore and hind limbs, and is not affected by the curvature and\r\ncrookedness of the claws, this latter feature being well marked\r\nin such existing terrestrial Edentates as the Great Ant-eater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242.--Front portion of the skeleton of _Andrias\r\nScheuchzeri_, a Giant Salamander from the Miocene Tertiary of\r\nOeningen, in Switzerland. Reduced in size.]\r\n\r\nThe aquatic _Sirenians_ and _Cetaceans_ are represented in Miocene\r\ntimes by various forms of no special importance. Amongst the\r\nformer, the previously existing genus _Halitherium_ continued to\r\nsurvive, and amongst the latter we meet with remains of Dolphins\r\nand of Whales of the \"Zeuglodont\" family. We may also note here\r\nthe first appearance of true \"Whalebone Whales,\" two species\r\nof which, resembling the living \"Right Whale\" of Arctic seas,\r\nand belonging to the same genus (_Baloena_), have been detected\r\nin the Miocene beds of North America.\r\n\r\nThe great order of the _Ungulates_ or Hoofed Quadrupeds is very\r\nlargely developed in strata of Miocene age, various new types\r\nof this group making their appearance here for the first time,\r\nwhilst some of the characteristic genera of the preceding period\r\nare still represented under new shapes. Amongst the Odd-toed\r\nor \"Perissodactyle\" Ungulates, we meet for the first time with\r\nrepresentatives of the family _Rhinoceridoe_ comprising only\r\nthe existing Rhinoceroses. In India in the Upper Miocene beds\r\nof the Siwâlik Hills, and in North America, several species of\r\nRhinoceros have been detected, agreeing with the existing forms\r\nin possessing three toes to each foot, and in having one or two\r\nsolid fibrous \"horns\" carried upon the front of the head. On\r\nthe other hand, the forms of this group which distinguish the\r\nMiocene deposits of Europe appear to have been for the most part\r\nhornless, and to have resembled the Tapirs in having three-toed\r\nhind-feet, but four-toed fore-feet.\r\n\r\nThe family of the Tapirs is represented, both in the Old and\r\nNew Worlds, by species of the genus _Lophiodon_, some of which\r\nwere quite diminutive in point of size, whilst others attained\r\nthe dimensions of a horse. Nearly allied to this family, also,\r\nis the singular group of quadrupeds which Marsh has described\r\nfrom the Miocene strata of the United States under the name of\r\n_Brontotheridoe_. These extraordinary animals, typified by\r\n_Brontotherium_ (fig. 243) itself, agree with the existing Tapirs\r\nof South America and the Indian Archipelago in having the fore-feet\r\nfour-toed, whilst the hind-feet are three-toed; and a further\r\npoint of resemblance is found in the fact (as shown by the form\r\nof the nasal bones) that the nose was long and flexible, forming\r\na short movable proboscis or trunk, by means of which the animal\r\nwas enabled to browse on shrubs or trees. They differ, however,\r\nfrom the Tapirs, not only in the apparent presence of a long tail,\r\nbut also in the possession of a pair of very large \"horn-cores,\"\r\ncarried upon the nasal bones, indicating that the animal possessed\r\nhorns of a similar structure to those of the \"Hollow-horned\"\r\nRuminants (_e.g._, Sheep and Oxen). _Brontotherium gigas_ is\r\nsaid to be nearly as large as an Elephant, whilst _B. Ingens_\r\nappears to have attained dimensions still more gigantic. The\r\nwell-known genus _Titanotherium_ of the American Miocene would\r\nalso appear to belong to this group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 243.--Skull of _Brontotherium ingens_. Miocene\r\nTertiary, United States. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe family of the Horses (_Equidoe_) appears under various forms\r\nin the Miocene, but the most important and best known of these\r\nis _Hipparion_. In this genus the general conformation of the\r\nskeleton is extremely similar to that of the existing Horses,\r\nand the external appearance of the animal must have been very\r\nmuch the same. The foot of _Hipparion_, however, as has been\r\npreviously mentioned, differed from that of the Horse in the\r\nfact that whilst both possess the middle toe greatly developed\r\nand enclosed in a broad hoof, the former, in addition, possessed\r\ntwo lateral toes, which were sufficiently developed to carry\r\nhoofs, but were so far rudimentary that they hung idly by the\r\nside of the central toe without touching the ground (see fig.\r\n230). In the Horse, on the other hand, these lateral toes, though\r\npresent, are not only functionally useless, but are concealed\r\nbeneath the skin. Remains of the _Hipparion_ have been found\r\nin various regions in Europe and in India; and from the immense\r\nquantities of their bones found in certain localities, it may\r\nbe safely inferred that these Middle Tertiary ancestors of the\r\nHorses lived, like their modern representatives, in great herds,\r\nand in open grassy plains or prairies.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Even-toed or _Artiodactyle_ Ungulates, we for the\r\nfirst time meet with examples of the _Hippopotamus_, with its\r\nfour-toed feet, its massive body, and huge tusk-like lower canine\r\nteeth. The Miocene deposits of Europe have not hitherto yielded\r\nany remains of _Hippopotamus_; but several species have been\r\ndetected in the Upper Miocene of the Siwâlik Hills by Dr Falconer\r\nand Sir Proby Cautley. These ancient Indian forms, however, differ\r\nfrom the existing _Hippopotamus amphibius_ of Africa in the fact\r\nthat they possessed six incisor teeth in each jaw (fig. 244),\r\nwhereas the latter has only four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 244.--a, Skull of _Hippopotamus Sivalensis_,\r\nviewed from below, one-eighth of the natural size; b, Molar\r\ntooth of the same, showing the surface of the crown, one-half\r\nof the natural size: c, Front of the lower jaw of the same,\r\nshowing the six incisors and the tusk-like canines, one-eighth of\r\nthe natural size. Upper Miocene, Siwâlik Hills; (After Falconer\r\nand Cautley.)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the other Even-toed Ungulates, the family of the Pigs\r\n(_Suida_) is represented by true Swine (_Sus Erymanthius_), Peccaries\r\n(_Dicotyles antiquus_), and by forms which, like the great\r\n_Elotherium_ of the American Miocene, have no representative at\r\nthe present day. The Upper Miocene of India has yielded examples\r\nof the Camels. Small Musk-deer (_Amphitragulus_ and _Dremotherium_)\r\nare known to have existed in France and Greece; and the true Deer\r\n(_Cervidoe_), with their solid bony antlers, appear for the first\r\ntime here in the person of species allied to the living Stags\r\n(_Cervus_), accompanied by the extinct genus _Dorcatherium_. The\r\nGiraffes (_Camelopardalidoe_), now confined to Africa, are known to\r\nhave lived in India and Greece; and the allied _Helladotherium_, in\r\nsome respects intermediate between the Giraffes and the Antelopes,\r\nranged over Southern Europe from Attica to France. The great\r\ngroup of the \"Hollow-horned\" Ruminants (_Cavicornia_), lastly,\r\ncame into existence in the Miocene period; and though the typical\r\nfamilies of the Sheep and Oxen are apparently wanting, there are\r\ntrue Antelopes, together with forms which, if systematically\r\nreferable to the _Antilopidoe_, nevertheless are more or less\r\nclearly transitional between this and the family of the Sheep and\r\nGoats. Thus the _Paloeoreas_ of the Upper Miocene of Greece may\r\nbe regarded as a genuine Antelope; but the _Tragoceras_ of the\r\nsame deposit is intermediate in its characters between the typical\r\nAntelopes and the Goats. Perhaps the most remarkable, however,\r\nof these Miocene Ruminants is the _Sivatherium giganteum_ (fig.\r\n245) of the Siwâlik Hills, in India. In this extraordinary animal\r\nthere were two pairs of horns, supported by bony \"horn-cores,\"\r\nso that there can be no hesitation in referring _Sivatherium_\r\nto the Cavicorn Ruminants. If all these horns had been simple,\r\nthere would have been no difficulty in considering _Sivatherium_\r\nas simply a gigantic four-horned Antelope, essentially similar\r\nto the living _Antilope_ (_Tetraceros_) _quadricornis_ of India.\r\nThe hinder pair of horns, however, is not only much larger than\r\nthe front pair, but each possesses two branches or snags--a\r\npeculiarity not to be paralleled amongst any existing Antelope,\r\nsave the abnormal Prongbuck (_Antilocapra_) of North America.\r\nDr Murie, however, in an admirable memoir on the structure and\r\nrelationships of _Sivatherium_, has drawn attention to the fact\r\nthat the Prongbuck sheds the _sheath_ of its horns annually,\r\nand has suggested that this may also have been the case with\r\nthe extinct form. This conjecture is rendered probable, amongst\r\nother reasons, by the fact that no traces of a horny sheath\r\nsurrounding the horn-cores of the Indian fossil have been as\r\nyet detected. Upon the whole, therefore, we may regard the\r\nelephantine _Sivatherium_ as being most nearly allied to the\r\nProngbuck of Western America, and thus as belonging to the family\r\nof the Antelopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.--Skull of _Sivatherium giganteum_, reduced\r\nin size. Miocene, India. (After Murie.)]\r\n\r\nIt is to the Miocene period, again, to which we must refer the\r\nfirst appearance of the important order of the Elephants and\r\ntheir allies (_Proboscideans_), all of which are characterised\r\nby their elongated trunk-like noses, the possession of five toes\r\nto the foot, the absence of canine teeth, the development of two\r\nor more of the incisor teeth into long tusks, and the adaptation\r\nof the molar teeth to a vegetable diet. Only three generic groups\r\nof this order are known-namely, the extinct _Deinotherium_, the\r\nequally extinct _Mastodons_, and the _Elephants_; and all these\r\nthree types are known to have been in existence as early as the\r\nMiocene period, the first of them being exclusively confined to\r\ndeposits of this age. Of the three, the genus _Deinotherium_\r\nis much the most abnormal in its characters; so much so, that\r\ngood authorities regard it as really being one of the Sea-cows\r\n(_Sirenia_)--though this view has been rendered untenable by\r\nthe discovery of limb-bones which can hardly belong to any other\r\nanimal, and which are distinctly Proboscidean in type. The most\r\ncelebrated skull of the Deinothere (fig. 246) is one which was\r\nexhumed from the Upper Miocene deposits of Epplesheim, in\r\nHesse-Darmstadt, in the year 1836. This skull was four and a half\r\nfeet in length, and indicated an animal larger than any existing\r\nspecies of Elephant. The upper jaw is destitute of incisor or\r\ncanine teeth, but is furnished on each side with five molars,\r\nwhich are opposed to a corresponding series of grinding teeth in\r\nthe lower jaw. No canines are present in the lower jaw; but the\r\nfront portion of the jaw is abruptly bent downwards, and carries\r\ntwo huge tusk-like incisor teeth, which are curved downwards and\r\nbackwards, and the use of which is rather problematical. Not\r\nonly does the Deinothere occur in Europe, but remains belonging\r\nto this genus have also been detected in the Siwâlik Hills, in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 246.--Skull of _Deinotherium giganteum_, greatly\r\nreduced. From the Upper Micene of Germany.]\r\n\r\nThe true Elephants (_Elephas_) do not appear to have existed\r\nduring the Miocene period in Europe, but several species have\r\nbeen detected in the Upper Miocene deposits of the Siwâlik Hills,\r\nin India. The fossil forms, though in all cases specifically, and\r\nin some cases even sub-generically, distinct, agree with those\r\nnow in existence in the general conformation of their skeleton,\r\nand in the principal characters of their dentition. In all, the\r\ncanine teeth are wanting in both jaws; and there are no incisor\r\nteeth in the lower jaw, whilst there are two incisors in the\r\nfront of the upper jaw, which are developed into two huge \"tusks.\"\r\nThere are six molar teeth on each side of both the upper and lower\r\njaw, but only one, or at most a part of two, is in actual use\r\nat any given time; and as this becomes worn away, it is pushed\r\nforward and replaced by its successor behind it. The molars are of\r\nvery large size, and are each composed of a number of transverse\r\nplates of enamel united together by ivory; and by the process\r\nof mastication, the teeth become worn down to a flat surface,\r\ncrossed by the enamel-ridges in varying patterns; These patterns\r\nare different in the different species of Elephants, though constant\r\nfor each; and they constitute one of the most readily available\r\nmeans of separating the fossil forms from one another. Of the\r\nseven Miocene Elephants of India, as judged by the characters of\r\nthe molar, teeth, two are allied to the existing Indian Elephant,\r\none is related to the living African Elephant, and the remaining\r\nfour are in some respects intermediate between the true Elephants\r\nand the Mastodons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 247.--A, Molar tooth of _Elephas planifrons_,\r\none-third of the natural size, showing the grinding surface--from\r\nthe Upper Miocene of India; B, Profile view of the last upper molar\r\nof _Mastodon Sivalensis_, one-third of the natural size--from\r\nthe Upper Miocene of India. (After Falconer.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Mastodons_, lastly, though quite elephantine in their general\r\ncharacters, possess molar teeth which have their crowns furnished\r\nwith conical eminences or tubercles placed in pairs (fig. 247, B),\r\ninstead of having the approximately flat surface characteristic\r\nof the grinders of the Elephants. As in the latter, there are two\r\nupper incisor teeth, which grow permanently during the life of\r\nthe animal, and which constitute great tusks; but the Mastodons,\r\nin addition, often possess two lower incisors, which in some\r\ncases likewise grow into small tusks. Three species of _Mastodon_\r\nare known to occur in the Upper Miocene of the Siwâlik Hills\r\nof India; and the Miocene deposits of the European area have\r\nyielded the remains of four species, of which the best known are\r\nthe _M. Longirostris_ and the _M. Angustidens_.\r\n\r\nWhilst herbivorous Quadrupeds, as we have seen, were extremely\r\nabundant during Miocene times, and often attained gigantic\r\ndimensions, Beasts of Prey (_Carnivora_) were by no means wanting,\r\nmost of the principal existing families of the order being\r\nrepresented in deposits of this age. Thus, we find aquatic Carnivores\r\nbelonging to both the living groups of the Seals and Walruses;\r\ntrue Bears are wanting, but their place is filled by the\r\nclosely-allied genus _Amphicyon_, of which various species are\r\nknown; Weasels and Otters were not unknown, and the _Hyoenictis_\r\nand _Iditherium_ of the Upper Miocene of Greece are apparently\r\nintermediate between the Civet-cats and the Hyænas; whilst the great\r\nCats of subsequent periods are more than adequately represented by\r\nthe huge \"Sabre-toothed Tiger\" (_Machairodus_), with its immense\r\ntrenchant and serrated canine teeth.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Rodent_ Mammals, the Miocene rocks have yielded\r\nremains of Rabbits, Porcupines (such as the _Hystrix primigenius_\r\nof Greece), Beavers, Mice, Jerboas, Squirrels, and Marmots. All the\r\nprincipal living groups of this order were therefore differentiated\r\nin Middle Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nThe _Cheiroptera_ are represented by small insect-eating Bats;\r\nand the order of the Insectivorous Mammals is represented by\r\nMoles, Shrew-mice, and Hedgehogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 248.--Lower jaw of _Pliopithcus antiquus_.\r\nUpper Miocene, France.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the Monkeys (_Quadrumana_) appear to have existed during\r\nthe Miocene period under a variety of forms, remains of these\r\nanimals having been found both in Europe and in India; but no member\r\nof this order has as yet been detected in the Miocene Tertiary of\r\nthe North American continent. Amongst the Old World Monkeys of\r\nthe Miocene, the two most interesting are the _Pliopithecus_\r\nand _Dryopithecus_ of France. The former of these (fig. 248)\r\nis supposed to have been most nearly related to the living\r\n_Semnopitheci_ of Southern Asia, in which case it must have possessed\r\na long tail. The _Mesopithecus_ of the Upper Miocene of Greece is\r\nalso one of the lower Monkeys, as it is most closely allied to\r\nthe existing Macaques. On the other hand, the _Dryopithecus_\r\nof the French Upper Miocene is referable to the group of the\r\n\"Anthropoid Apes,\" and is most nearly related to the Gibbons\r\nof the present day, in which the tail is rudimentary and there\r\nare no cheek-pouches. _Dryopithecus_ was, also, of large size,\r\nequalling Man in stature, and apparently living amongst the trees\r\nand feeding upon fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE PLIOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe highest division of the Tertiary deposits is termed the\r\n_Pliocene_ formation, in accordance with the classification proposed\r\nby Sir Charles Lyell. The Pliocene formations contain from 40 to\r\n95 per cent of existing species of _Mollusca_, the remainders\r\nbelonging to extinct species. They are divided by Sir Charles\r\nLyell into two divisions, the Older Pliocene and Newer Pliocene.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene deposits of Britain occur in Suffolk, and are known\r\nby the name of \"Crags,\" this being a local term used for certain\r\nshelly sands, which are employed in agriculture. Two of these\r\nCrags are referable to the Older Pliocene, viz., the White and\r\nRed Crags,--and one belongs to the Newer Pliocene, viz., the\r\nNorwich Crag.\r\n\r\nThe _White or Coralline Crag_ of Suffolk is the oldest of the\r\nPliocene deposits of Britain, and is an exceedingly local formation,\r\noccurring in but a single small area, and having a maximum thickness\r\nof not more than 50 feet. It consists of soft sands, with occasional\r\nintercalations of flaggy limestone. Though of small extent and\r\nthickness, the Coralline Crag is of importance from the number\r\nof fossils which it contains. The name \"Coralline\" is a misnomer;\r\nsince there are few true Corals, and the so-called \"Corals\" of\r\nthe formation are really _Polyzoa_, often of very singular forms.\r\nThe shells of the Coralline Crag are mostly such as inhabit the\r\nseas of temperate regions; but there occur some forms usually\r\nlooked upon as indicating a warm climate.\r\n\r\nThe _Upper_ or _Red Crag_ of Suffolk--like the Coralline Crag--has\r\na limited geographical extent and a small thickness, rarely exceeding\r\n40 feet. It consists of quartzose sands, usually deep red or\r\nbrown in colour, and charged with numerous fossils.\r\n\r\nAltogether more than 200 species of shells are known from the\r\nRed Crag, of which 60 per cent are referable to existing species.\r\nThe shells indicate, upon the whole, a temperate or even cold\r\nclimate, decidedly less warm than that indicated by the organic\r\nremains of the Coralline Crag. It appears, therefore, that a\r\ngradual refrigeration was going on during the Pliocene period,\r\ncommencing in the Coralline Crag, becoming intensified in the Red\r\nCrag, being still more severe in the Norwich Crag, and finally\r\nculminating in the Arctic cold of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Mollusca_, the Red Crag contains the ear-bones of\r\nWhales, the teeth of Sharks and Rays, and remains of the Mastodon,\r\nRhinoceros, and Tapir.\r\n\r\nThe _Newer Pliocene_ deposits are represented in Britain by the\r\n_Norwich Crag_, a local formation occurring near Norwich. It\r\nconsists of incoherent sands, loams, and gravels, resting in\r\ndetached patches, from 2 to 20 feet in thickness, upon an eroded\r\nsurface of Chalk. The Norwich Crag contains a mixture of marine,\r\nland, and fresh-water shells, with remains of fishes and bones\r\nof mammals; so that it must have been deposited as a local\r\nsea-deposit near the mouth of an ancient river. It contains\r\naltogether more than 100 marine shells, of which 89 per cent\r\nbelong to existing species. Of the Mammals, the two most important\r\nare an Elephant (_Elephas meridionalis_), and the characteristic\r\nPliocene Mastodon (_M. Arvernensis_), which is hitherto the only\r\nMastodon found in Britain.\r\n\r\nAccording to the most recent views of high authorities, certain\r\ndeposits--such as the so-called \"Bridlington Crag\" of Yorkshire,\r\nand the \"Chillesford beds\" of Suffolk--are to be also included\r\nin the Newer Pliocene, upon the ground that they contain a small\r\nproportion of extinct shells. Our knowledge, however, of the\r\nexisting Molluscan fauna, is still so far incomplete, that it\r\nmay reasonably be doubted if these supposed extinct forms have\r\nactually made their final disappearance, whilst the strata in\r\nquestion have a strong natural connection with the \"Glacial\r\ndeposits,\" as shown by the number of Arctic Mollusca which they\r\ncontain. Here, therefore, these beds will be included in the\r\nPost-Pliocene series, in spite of the fact that some of their\r\nspecies of shells are not known to exist at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe following are the more important Pliocene deposits which have\r\nbeen hitherto recognised out of Britain:--\r\n\r\n1. In the neighbourhood of Antwerp occur certain \"crags,\" which\r\nare the equivalent of the White and Red Crag in part. The lowest\r\nof these contains less than 50 per cent, and the highest 60 per\r\ncent, of existing species of shells, the remainder being extinct.\r\n\r\n2. Bordering the chain of the Apennines, in Italy, on both sides\r\nis a series of low hills made up of Tertiary strata, which are\r\nknown as the Sub-Apennine beds. Part of these is of Miocene age,\r\npart is Older Pliocene, and a portion is Newer Pliocene. The\r\nOlder Pliocene portion of the Sub-Apennines consists of blue or\r\nbrown marls, which sometimes attain a thickness of 2000 feet.\r\n\r\n3. In the valley of the Arno, above Florence, are both Older\r\nand Newer Pliocene strata. The former consist of blue clays and\r\nlignites, with an abundance of plants. The latter consist of sands\r\nand conglomerates, with remains of large Carnivorous Mammals,\r\nMastodon, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, &c.\r\n\r\n4. In Sicily, Newer Pliocene strata are probably more largely\r\ndeveloped than anywhere else in the world, rising sometimes to a\r\nheight of 3000 feet above the sea. The series consists of clays,\r\nmarls, sands, and conglomerates, capped by a compact limestone,\r\nwhich attains a thickness of from 700 to 800 feet. The fossils of\r\nthese beds belong almost entirely to living species, one of the\r\ncommonest being the Great Scallop of the Mediterranean (_Pecten\r\nJacoboeus_).\r\n\r\n5. Occupying an extensive area round the Caspian, Aral, and Azof\r\nSeas, are Pliocene deposits known as the \"Aralo-Caspian\" beds.\r\nThe fossils in these beds are partly freshwater, partly marine,\r\nand partly intermediate in character, and they are in great part\r\nidentical with species now inhabiting the Caspian. The entire\r\nformation appears to indicate the former existence of a great\r\nsheet of brackish water, forming an inland sea, like the Caspian,\r\nbut as large as, or larger than, the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n6. In the United States, strata of Pliocene age are found in\r\nNorth and South Carolina. They consist of sands and clays, with\r\nnumerous fossils, chiefly _Molluscs_ and _Echinoderms_. From 40\r\nto 60 per cent of the fossils belong to existing species. On\r\nthe Loup Fork of the river Platte, in the Upper Missouri region,\r\nare strata which are also believed to be referable to the Pliocene\r\nperiod, and probably to its upper division. They are from 300 to\r\n400 feet thick, and contain land-shells, with the bones of numerous\r\nMammals, such as Camels, Rhinoceroses, Mastodons, Elephants, the\r\nHorse, Stag, &c.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _life_ of the Pliocene period, there are only\r\ntwo classes of organisms to which our attention need be\r\ndirected--namely, the Shell-fish and the Mammals. So far as the\r\nformer are concerned, we have to note in the first place that\r\nthe introduction of new species of animals upon the globe went\r\non rapidly during this period. In the Older Pliocene deposits,\r\nthe number of shells of existing species is only from 40 to 60\r\nper cent; but in the Newer Pliocene the proportion of living\r\nforms rises to as much as from 80 to 95 per cent. Whilst the\r\nMolluscs thus become rapidly modernised, the Mammals still all\r\nbelong to extinct species, though modern generic types gradually\r\nsupersede the more antiquated forms of the Miocene. In the second\r\nplace, there is good evidence to show that the Pliocene period\r\nwas one in which the climate of the northern hemisphere underwent\r\na gradual refrigeration. In the Miocene period, there is evidence\r\nto show that Europe possessed a climate very similar to that\r\nnow enjoyed by the Southern United States, and certainly very\r\nmuch warmer than it is at present. The presence of Palm-trees\r\nupon the land, and of numerous large Cowries, Cones, and other\r\nshells of warm regions in the sea, sufficiently proves this. In\r\nthe Older Pliocene deposits, on the other hand, northern forms\r\npredominate amongst the Shells, though some of the types of hotter\r\nregions still survive. In the Newer Pliocene, again, the Molluscs\r\nare such as almost exclusively inhabit the seas of temperate\r\nor even cold regions; whilst if we regard deposits like the\r\n\"Bridlington Crag\" and \"Chillesford beds\" as truly referable to\r\nthis period, we meet at the close of this period with shells such\r\nas nowadays are distinctively characteristic of high latitudes. It\r\nmight be thought that the occurrence of Quadrupeds such as the\r\nElephant, Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus, would militate against\r\nthis generalisation, and would rather support the view that the\r\nclimate of Europe and the United States must have been a hot\r\none during the later portion of the Pliocene period. We have,\r\nhowever, reason to believe that many of these extinct Mammals\r\nwere more abundantly furnished with hair, and more adapted to\r\nwithstand a cool temperature, than any of their living congeners.\r\nWe have also to recollect that many of these large herbivorous\r\nquadrupeds may have been, and indeed probably were, more or less\r\nmigratory in their habits; and that whilst the winters of the\r\nlater portion of the Pliocene period were cold, the summers might\r\nhave been very hot. This would allow of a northward migration\r\nof such terrestrial animals during the summer-time, when there\r\nwould be an ample supply of food and a suitably high temperature,\r\nand a southward recession towards the approach of winter.\r\n\r\nThe chief palæontological interests of the Pliocene deposits,\r\nas of the succeeding Post-Pliocene, centre round the Mammals of\r\nthe period; and amongst the many forms of these we may restrict\r\nour attention to the orders of the Hoofed Quadrupeds (_Ungulates_),\r\nthe _Proboscideans_, the _Carnivora_, and the _Quadrumana_. Almost\r\nall the other Mammalian orders are more or less fully represented\r\nin Pliocene times, but none of them attains any special interest\r\ntill we enter upon the Post-Pliocene.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Odd-toed Ungulates, in addition to the remains of\r\ntrue Tapirs (_Tapirus Arvernensis_), we meet with the bones of\r\nseveral species of Rhinoceros, of which the _Rhinoceros Etruscus_\r\nand _R. Megarhinus_ (fig. 249) are the most important. The former\r\nof these (fig. 249, A) derives its specific name from its abundance\r\nin the Pliocene deposits of the Val d'Arno, near Florence, and\r\nthough principally Pliocene in its distribution, it survived\r\ninto the earlier portion of the Post-Pliocene period. _Rhinoceros\r\nEtruscus_ agreed with the existing African forms in having two\r\nhorns placed one behind the other, the front one being the longest;\r\nbut it was comparatively slight and slender in its build, whilst\r\nthe nostrils were separated by an incomplete bony partition. In\r\nthe _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ (fig. 249, B), on the other hand, no\r\nsuch partition exists between the nostrils, and the nasal bones\r\nare greatly developed in size. It was a two-horned form, and is\r\nfound associated with _Elephas meridionalis_ and _E. Antiquus_ in\r\nthe Pliocene deposits of the Val d'Arno, near Florence. Like the\r\npreceding, it survived, in diminished numbers, into the earlier\r\nportion of the Post-Pliocene period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 249.--A. Under surface of the skull of\r\n_Rhinoceros Etruscus_, one-seventh of the natural size--Pliocene,\r\nItaly.; B, Crowns of the three true molars of the upper jaw, left\r\nside, of _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ (_R. Leptorhinus_, Falconer),\r\none-half of the natural size--Pliocene, France. (After Falconer.)]\r\n\r\nThe Horses (_Equidoe_) are represented, both in Europe and America,\r\nby the three-toed Hipparions, which survive from the Miocene,\r\nbut are now verging upon extinction. For the first time, also,\r\nwe meet with genuine Horses (_Equus_), in which each foot is\r\nprovided with a single complete toe only, encased in a single\r\nbroad hoof. One of the American species of this period (the _Equus\r\nexcelsus_) quite equalled the modern Horse in stature; and it\r\nis interesting to note the occurrence of indigenous horses in\r\nAmerica at such a comparatively late geological epoch, seeing\r\nthat this continent certainly possessed none of these animals\r\nwhen first discovered by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Even-toed Ungulates, we may note the occurrence of\r\nSwine (_Suida_), of forms allied to the Camels (_Camelidoe_), and\r\nof various kinds of Deer (_Cervidoe_); but the most interesting\r\nPliocene Mammal belonging to this section is the great _Hippopotamus\r\nmajor_ of Britain and Europe. This well-known species is very\r\nclosely allied to the living _Hippopotamus amphibius_ of Africa,\r\nfrom which it is separated only by its larger dimensions, and by\r\ncertain points connected with the conformation of the skeleton.\r\nIt is found very abundantly in the Pliocene deposits of Italy and\r\nFrance, associated with the remains of the Elephant, Mastodon,\r\nand Rhinoceros, and it survived into the earlier portion of the\r\nPost-Pliocene period. During this last-mentioned period, it extended\r\nits range northwards, and is found associated with the Reindeer,\r\nthe Bison, and other northern animals. From this fact it has been\r\ninferred, with great probability, that the _Hippotamus major_\r\nwas furnished with a long coat of hair and fur, thus differing\r\nfrom its nearly hairless modern representative, and resembling\r\nits associates, the Mammoth and the Woolly Rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 250.--Third milk-molar of the left side of\r\nthe upper jaw of _Mastodon Arvernensis_, showing the grinding\r\nsurface. Pliocene.]\r\n\r\nPassing on to the Pliocene Proboscideans, we find that the great\r\n_Deinotheria_ of the Miocene have now wholly disappeared, and the\r\nsole representatives of the order are Mastodons and Elephants.\r\nThe most important member of the former group is the _Mastodon\r\nArvernensis_ (fig. 250), which ranged widely over Southern Europe\r\nand England, being generally associated with remains of the _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis, E. antiquus, Rhinoceros megarhinus_, and _Hippopotamus\r\nmajor_. The lower jaw seems to have been destitute of incisor\r\nteeth; but the upper incisors are developed into great tusks,\r\nwhich sometimes reach a length of nine feet, and which have the\r\nsimple curvature of the tusks of the existing Elephants. Amongst\r\nthe Pliocene Elephants the two most important are the _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_ and the _Elephas antiquus_. Of these, the _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_ (fig. 251) is found abundantly in the Pliocene\r\ndeposits of Southern Europe and England, and also survived into\r\nthe earlier portion of the Post-Pliocene period. Its molar teeth\r\nare of the type of those of the existing African Elephant, the\r\nspaces enclosed by the transverse enamel-plates being more or\r\nless lozenge-shaped, whilst the curvature of the tusks is simple.\r\nThe _Elephas antiquus_ (fig. 252) is very generally associated\r\nwith the preceding, and it survived to an even later stage of\r\nthe Post-Pliocene period. The molar teeth are of the type of the\r\nexisting Indian Elephant, with comparatively thin enamel-ridges,\r\nplaced closer together than in the African type; whilst the tusks\r\nwere nearly straight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 251.--Molar tooth of _Elephas meridionalis_,\r\none-third of the natural size. Pliocene and Post-Pliocene.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 252.--Molar tooth of _Elephas antiquus_,\r\none-third of the natural size. Pliocene and Post-Pliocene.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Pliocene _Carnivores_, we meet with true Bears (_Ursus\r\nArvernensis_), Hyænas (such as _Hyoena Hipparionum_), and genuine\r\nLions (such as the _Felis angustus_ of North America); but the\r\nmost remarkable of the beasts of prey of this period is the great\r\n\"Sabre-toothed Tiger\" (_Machairodus_), species of which existed\r\nin the earlier Miocene, and survived to the later Post-Pliocene.\r\nIn this remarkable form we are presented with perhaps the most\r\nhighly carnivorous type of all known beasts of prey. Not only\r\nare the jaws shorter in proportion even than those of the great\r\nCats of the present day, but the canine teeth (fig. 253) are\r\nof enormous size, greatly flattened so as to assume the form\r\nof a poignard, and having their margins finely serrated. A part\r\nfrom the characters of the skull, the remainder of the skeleton,\r\nso far as known, exhibits proofs that the Sabre-toothed Tiger\r\nwas extraordinarily muscular and powerful, and in the highest\r\ndegree adapted for a life of rapine. Species of _Machairodus_\r\nmust have been as large as the existing Lion; and the genus is\r\nnot only European, but is represented both in South America and\r\nin India, so that the geographical range of these predaceous\r\nbeasts must have been very extensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 253.--A, Skull of _Machairodus cultridens_,\r\nwithout the lower jaw, reduced in size; B, Canine tooth of the\r\nsame, one-half the natural size. Pliocene, France.]\r\n\r\nLastly, we may note that the Pliocene deposits of Europe have\r\nyielded the remains of Monkeys (_Quadrumana_), allied to the\r\nexisting _Semnopitheci_ and Macaques.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following list comprises a small selection of some of the\r\nmore important and readily accessible works and memoirs relating\r\nto the Tertiary rocks and their fossils.

In all these formations we meet with no _Mollusca_\r\nexcept such as are now alive--with the partial and very limited\r\nexception of some of the oldest deposits of this period, in which\r\na few of the shells occasionally belong to species not known\r\nto be in existence at the present day. Whilst the _Shell-fish_\r\nof the Quaternary deposits are, generally speaking, identical\r\nwith existing forms, the _Mammals_ are sometimes referable to\r\nliving, sometimes to extinct species. In accordance with this,\r\nthe Quaternary formations are divided into two groups: (1) The\r\n_Post-Pliocene_, in which the shells are almost invariably referable\r\nto existing species, but some of the _Mammals are extinct_; and\r\n(2) the _Recent_, in which _the shells and the Mammals alike\r\nbelong to existing species_. The Post-Pliocene deposits are often\r\nspoken of as the Pleistocene formations (Gr. _pleistos_, most;\r\n_kainos_, new or recent), in allusion to the fact that the great\r\nmajority of the living beings of this period belong to the species\r\ncharacteristic of the \"new\" or Recent period.\r\n\r\nThe _Recent_ deposits, though of the highest possible interest,\r\ndo not properly concern the palæontologist strictly so-called, but\r\nthe zoologist, since they contain the remains of none but existing\r\nanimals. They are \"Pre-historic,\" but they belong entirely to\r\nthe existing terrestrial order. The _Post-Pliocene_ deposits, on\r\nthe other hand, contain the remains of various extinct Mammals;\r\nand though Man undoubtedly existed in, at any rate, the later\r\nportion of this period, if not throughout the whole of it, they\r\nproperly form part of the domain of the palæontologist.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Pliocene deposits are extremely varied, and very widely\r\ndistributed; and owing to the mode of their occurrence, the ordinary\r\ngeological tests of age are in their case but very partially\r\navailable. The subject of the classification of these deposits\r\nis therefore an extremely complicated one; and as regards the age\r\nof even some of the most important of them, there still exists\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion. For our present purpose, it\r\nwill be convenient to adopt a classification of the Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits founded on the relations which they bear in time to the\r\ngreat \"Ice-age\" or \"Glacial period;\" though it is not pretended\r\nthat our present knowledge is sufficient to render such a\r\nclassification more than a provisional one.\r\n\r\nIn the early Tertiary period, as we have seen, the climate of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, as shown by the Eocene animals and plants,\r\nwas very much hotter than it is at present--partaking, indeed, of a\r\nsub-tropical character. In the Middle Tertiary or Miocene period,\r\nthe temperature, though not so high, was still much warmer than\r\nthat now enjoyed by the northern hemisphere; and we know that the\r\nplants of temperate regions at this time flourished within the\r\nArctic circle. In the later Tertiary or Pliocene period, again,\r\nthere is evidence that the northern hemisphere underwent a further\r\nprogressive diminution of temperature; though the climate of Europe\r\ngenerally seems at the close of the Tertiary period to have been\r\nif anything warmer, or at any rate not colder, than it is at\r\nthe present day. With the commencement of the Quaternary period,\r\nhowever, this diminution of temperature became more decided; and\r\nbeginning with a temperate climate, we find the greater portion\r\nof the northern hemisphere to become gradually subjected to all\r\nthe rigours of intense Arctic cold. All the mountainous regions\r\nof Northern and Central Europe, of Britain, and of North America,\r\nbecame the nurseries of huge ice-streams, and large areas of the\r\nland appear to have been covered with a continuous ice-sheet.\r\nThe Arctic conditions of this, the well-known \"Glacial period,\"\r\nrelaxed more than once, and were more than once re-established\r\nwith lesser intensity. Finally, a gradual but steadily progressive\r\namelioration of temperature took place; the ice slowly gave way,\r\nand ultimately disappeared altogether; and the climate once more\r\nbecame temperate, except in high northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe changes of temperature sketched out above took place slowly\r\nand gradually, and occupied the whole of the Post-Pliocene period.\r\nIn each of the three periods marked out by these changes--in\r\nthe early temperate, the central cold, and the later temperate\r\nperiod--certain deposits were laid down over the surface of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere; and these deposits collectively constitute the\r\nPost-Pliocene formations. Hence we may conveniently classify all\r\nthe accumulations of this age under the heads of (1) _Pre-Glacial_\r\ndeposits, (2) _Glacial_ deposits, and (3) _Post-Glacial_ deposits,\r\naccording as they were formed before, during, or after the \"Glacial\r\nperiod.\" It cannot by any means be asserted that we can definitely\r\nfix the precise relations in time of all the Post-Pliocene deposits\r\nto the Glacial period. On the contrary, there are some which\r\nhold a very disputed position as regards this point; and there\r\nare others which do not admit of definite allocation in this\r\nmanner at all, in consequence of their occurrence in regions\r\nwhere no \"Glacial Period\" is known to have been established.\r\nFor our present purpose, however, dealing as we shall have to do\r\nprincipally with the northern hemisphere, the above classification,\r\nwith all its defects, has greater advantages than any other that\r\nhas been yet proposed.\r\n\r\nI. PRE-GLACIAL DEPOSITS.--The chief pre-glacial deposit of Britain\r\nis found on the Norfolk coast, reposing upon the Newer Pliocene\r\n(Norwich Crag), and consists of an ancient land-surface which\r\nis known as the \"Cromer Forest-bed.\"\r\n\r\nThis consists of an ancient soil, having embedded in it the stumps\r\nof many trees, still in an erect position, with remains of living\r\nplants, and the bones of recent and extinct quadrupeds. It is\r\noverlaid by fresh-water and marine beds, all the shells of which\r\nbelong to existing species, and it is finally surmounted by true\r\n\"glacial drift.\" While all the shells and plants of the Cromer\r\nForest-bed and its associated strata belong to existing species,\r\nthe Mammals are partly living, partly extinct. Thus we find the\r\nexisting Wolf (_Canis lupus_), Red Deer (_Cervus elaphus_), Roebuck\r\n(_Cervus capreolus_), Mole (_Talpa Europtoea_), and Beaver (_Castor\r\nfiber_), living in western England side by side with the\r\n_Hippopotamus major, Elephas antiquus, Elephas meridionalis,\r\nRhinoceros Etruscus_, and _R. Megarhinus_ of the Pliocene period,\r\nwhich are not only extinct, but imply an at any rate moderately\r\nwarm climate. Besides the above, the Forest-bed has yielded the\r\nremains of several extinct species of Deer, of the great extinct\r\nBeaver (_Trogontherium Cuvieri_), of the Caledonian Bull or \"Urus\"\r\n(_Bos primigenius_), and of a Horse (_Equus fossilis_), little\r\nif at all distinguishable from the existing form.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Bridlington Crag\" of Yorkshire, and the \"Chillesford\r\nBeds\" of Suffolk, are probably to be regarded as also belonging\r\nto this period; though many of the shells which they contain\r\nare of an Arctic character, and would indicate that they were\r\ndeposited in the commencement of the Glacial period itself. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the fact that a few of the shells of these deposits\r\nare not known to occur in a living condition, these, and some\r\nother similar accumulations, are sometimes considered as referable\r\nto the Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nII. GLACIAL DEPOSITS.--Under this head is included a great series\r\nof deposits which are widely spread over both Europe and America,\r\nand which were formed at a time when the climate of these countries\r\nwas very much colder than it is at present, and approached more\r\nor less closely to what we see at the present day in the Arctic\r\nregions. These deposits are known by the general name of the\r\n_Glacial deposits_, or by the more specialised names of the Drift,\r\nthe Northern Drift, the Boulder-clay, the Till, &c.\r\n\r\nThese glacial deposits are found in Britain as far south as the\r\nThames, over the whole of Northern Europe, in all the more elevated\r\nportions of Southern and Central Europe, and over the whole of\r\nNorth America, as far south as the 39th parallel. They generally\r\noccur as sands, clays, and gravels, spread in widely-extended\r\nsheets over all the geological formations alike, except the most\r\nrecent, and are commonly spoken of under the general term of\r\n\"Glacial drift.\" They vary much in their exact nature in different\r\ndistricts, but they universally consist of one, or all, of the\r\nfollowing members:--\r\n\r\n1. _Unstratified_ clays, or loams, containing numerous angular\r\nor sub-angular blocks of stone, which have often been transported\r\nfor a greater or less distance from their parent rock, and which\r\noften exhibit polished, grooved, or striated surfaces. These\r\nbeds are what is called _Boulder-clay_, or _Till_.\r\n\r\n2. Sands, gravels, and clays, often more or less regularly\r\n_stratified_, but containing erratic blocks, often of large size,\r\nand with their edges _unworn_, derived from considerable distances\r\nfrom the place where they are now found. In these beds it is\r\nnot at all uncommon to find fossil shells; and these, though of\r\nexisting species, are generally of an Arctic character, comprising\r\na greater or less number of forms which are now exclusively found\r\nin the icy waters of the Arctic seas. These beds are often spoken\r\nof as \"Stratified Drift.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Stratified_ sands and gravels, in which the pebbles are _worn_\r\nand rounded, and which have been produced by a rearrangement of\r\nordinary glacial beds by the sea. These beds are commonly known\r\nas \"Drift-gravels,\" or \"Regenerated Drift\".\r\n\r\nSome of the last-mentioned of these are doubtless post-glacial;\r\nbut, in the absence of fossils, it is often impossible to arrive at\r\na positive opinion as to the precise age of superficial accumulations\r\nof this nature. It is also the opinion of high authorities that a\r\nconsiderable number of the so-called \"cave-deposits,\" with the\r\nbones of extinct Mammals, truly belong to the Glacial period,\r\nbeing formed during warm intervals when the severity of the Arctic\r\ncold had become relaxed. It is further believed that some, at\r\nany rate, of the so-called \"high-level\" river-gravels and\r\n\"brick-earths\" have likewise been deposited during mild or warm\r\nintervals in the great age of ice; and in two or three instances\r\nthis has apparently been demonstrated--deposits of this nature,\r\nwith the bones of extinct animals and the implements of man,\r\nhaving been shown to be overlaid by true Boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nThe fossils of the undoubted Glacial deposits are principally\r\nshells, which are found in great numbers in certain localities,\r\nsometimes with _Foraminifera_, the bivalved cases of Ostracode\r\nCrustaceans, &c. Whilst some of the shells of the \"Drift\" are such\r\nas now live in the seas of temperate regions, others, as previously\r\nremarked, are such as are now only known to live in the seas of\r\nhigh latitudes; and these therefore afford unquestionable evidence\r\nof cold conditions. Amongst these Arctic forms of shells which\r\ncharacterise the Glacial beds may be mentioned _Pecten Islandicus_\r\n(fig. 254), _Pecten Groenlandicus, Scalaria Groenlandica, Leda\r\ntruncata, Astarte borealis, Tellina proxima, Nattra clausa_,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 254.--Left valve of _Pecten Islandicus_, Glacial\r\nand Recent.]\r\n\r\nIII. POST-GLACIAL DEPOSITS.--As the intense cold of the Glacial\r\nperiod became gradually mitigated, and temperate conditions of\r\nclimate were once more re-established, various deposits were\r\nformed in the northern hemisphere, which are found to contain\r\nthe remains of extinct Mammals, and which, therefore, are clearly\r\nof Post-Pliocene age. To these deposits the general name of\r\n_Post-Glacial_ formations is given; but it is obvious that, from\r\nthe nature of the case, and with our present limited knowledge,\r\nwe cannot draw a rigid line of demarcation between the deposits\r\nformed towards the close of the Glacial period, or during warm\r\n\"interglacial\" periods, and those laid down after the ice had\r\nfairly disappeared. Indeed it is extremely improbable that any\r\nsuch rigid line of demarcation should ever have existed; and it\r\nis far more likely that the Glacial and Post-Glacial periods,\r\nand their corresponding deposits, shade into one another by an\r\nimperceptible gradation. Accepting this reservation, we may group\r\ntogether, under the general head of \"Post-Glacial Deposits,\"\r\nmost of the so-called \"Valley-gravels,\" \"Brick-earths,\" and\r\n\"Cave-deposits,\" together with some \"raised beaches\" and various\r\ndeposits of peat. Though not strictly within the compass of this\r\nwork, a few words may be said here as to the origin and mode of\r\nformation of the Brick-earths, Valley-gravels, and Cave-deposits,\r\nas the subject will thus be rendered more clearly intelligible.\r\n\r\nEvery river produces at the present day beds of fine mud and\r\nloam, and accumulations of gravel, which it deposits at various\r\nparts of its course--the gravel generally occupying the lowest\r\nposition, and the finer sands and mud coming above. Numerous\r\ndeposits of a similar nature are found in most countries in various\r\nlocalities, and at various heights above the present channels of\r\nour rivers. Many of these fluviatile (Lat. _fluvius_, a river)\r\ndeposits consist of fine loam, worked for brick-making, and known\r\nas \"Brick-earths;\" and they have yielded the remains of numerous\r\nextinct Mammals, of which the Mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_) is\r\nthe most abundant. In the valley of the Rhine these fluviatile\r\nloams (known as \"Loess\") attain a thickness of several hundred\r\nfeet, and contain land and fresh-water shells of existing species.\r\nWith these occur the remains of Mammals, such as the Mammoth and\r\nWoolly Rhinoceros. Many of these Brick-earths are undoubtedly\r\nPost-Glacial, but others seem to be clearly \"inter-glacial;\" and\r\ninstances have recently been brought forward in which deposits\r\nof Brick-earth containing bones and shells of fresh-water Molluscs\r\nhave been found to be overlaid by regular unstratified boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Valley-gravels,\" like the Brick-earths, are fluviatile\r\ndeposits, but are of a coarser nature, consisting of sands and\r\ngravels. Every river gives origin to deposits of this kind at\r\ndifferent points along the course of its valley; and it is not\r\nuncommon to find that there exist in the valley of a single river\r\ntwo or more sets of these gravel-beds, formed by the river itself,\r\nbut formed at times when the river ran at different levels, and\r\ntherefore formed at different periods. These different accumulations\r\nare known as the \"high-level\" and \"low-level\" gravels; and a\r\nreference to the accompanying diagram will explain the origin\r\nand nature of these deposits (fig. 255). When a river begins\r\nto occupy a particular line of drainage, and to form its own\r\nchannel, it will deposit fluviatile sands and gravels along its\r\nsides. As it goes on deepening the bed or valley through which\r\nit flows, it will deposit other fluviatile strata at a lower\r\nlevel beside its new bed. In this way have arisen the terms\r\n\"high-level\" and \"low-level\" gravels. We find, for instance, a\r\nmodern river flowing through a valley which it has to a great\r\nextent or entirely formed itself; by the side of its immediate\r\nchannel we may find gravels, sand, and loam (fig. 255, 2 2')\r\ndeposited by the river flowing in its present bed. These are\r\n_recent_ fluviatile or alluvial deposits. At some distance from\r\nthe present bed of the river, and at a higher level, we may find\r\nother sands and gravels, quite like the recent ones in character\r\nand origin, but formed at a time when the stream flowed at a higher\r\nlevel, and before it had excavated its valley to its present\r\ndepth. These (fig. 255, 3 3') are the so-called \"_low-level_\r\ngravels\" of a river. At a still higher level, and still farther\r\nremoved from the present bed of the river, we may find another\r\nterrace, composed of just the same materials as the lower one,\r\nbut formed at a still earlier period, when the excavation of\r\nthe valley had proceeded to a much less extent. These (fig. 255,\r\n4 4') are the so-called \"_high-level_ gravels\" of a river, and\r\nthere may be one or more terraces of these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 255.--Recent and Post-Pliocene Alluvial Deposits.\r\n1, Peat of the recent period; 2, Gravel of the modern river:\r\n2', Loam of the modern river; 3.

(After Sir Charles Lyell.)]\r\n\r\nThe important fact to remember about these fluviatile deposits\r\nis this--that here the ordinary geological rule is reversed. The\r\nhigh-level gravels are, of course, the highest, so far as their\r\nactual elevation above the sea is concerned; but geologically the\r\nlowest, since they are obviously much older than the low-level\r\ngravels, as these are than the recent gravels. How much older\r\nthe high-level gravels may be than the low-level ones, it is\r\nimpossible to say. They occur at heights varying from 10 to 100\r\nfeet above the present river-channels, and they are therefore\r\nolder than the recent gravels by the time required by the river\r\nto dig out its own bed to this depth. How long this period may\r\nbe, our data do not enable us to determine accurately; but if\r\nwe are to calculate from the observed rate of erosion of the\r\nactually existing rivers, the period between the different\r\nvalley-gravels must be a very long one.\r\n\r\nThe lowest or recent fluviatile deposits which occur beside the\r\nbed of the present river, are referable to the Recent period,\r\nas they contain the remains of none but living Mammals. The two\r\nother sets of gravels are Post-Pliocene, as they contain the\r\nbones of extinct Mammals, mixed with land and fresh-water shells\r\nof existing species. Among the more important extinct Mammals\r\nof the low-level and high-level valley-gravels may be mentioned\r\nthe _Elephas antiquus_, the Mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_),\r\nthe Woolly Rhinoceros (_R. Tichorhinus_), the Hippopotamus, the\r\nCave-lion, and the Cave-bear. Along with these are found\r\nunquestionable traces of the existence of Man, in the form of\r\nrude flint implements of undoubted human workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Cave-deposits,\" again, though exhibiting peculiarities\r\ndue to the fact of their occurrence in caverns or fissures in the\r\nrocks, are in many respects essentially similar to the older\r\nvalley-gravels. Caves, in the great majority of instances, occur\r\nin limestone. When this is not the case, it will generally be\r\nfound that they occur along lines of sea-coast, or along lines\r\nwhich can be shown to have anciently formed the coast-line. There\r\nare many caves, however, in the making of which it can be shown\r\nthat the sea has had no hand; and these are most of the caves\r\nof limestone districts. These owe their origin to the solvent\r\naction upon lime of water holding carbonic acid in solution.\r\nThe rain which falls upon a limestone district absorbs a certain\r\namount of carbonic acid from the air, or from the soil. It then\r\npercolates through the rock, generally along the lines of jointing\r\nso characteristic of limestones, and in its progress it dissolves\r\nand carries off a certain quantity of carbonate of lime. In this\r\nway, the natural joints and fissures in the rock are widened, as\r\ncan be seen at the present day in any or all limestone districts.\r\nBy a continuance of this action for a sufficient length of time,\r\ncaves may ultimately be produced. Nothing, also, is commoner\r\nin a limestone district than for the natural drainage to take\r\nthe line of some fissure, dissolving the rock in its course. In\r\nthis way we constantly meet in limestone districts with springs\r\nissuing from the limestone rock--sometimes as large rivers--the\r\nwaters of which are charged with carbonate of lime, obtained by\r\nthe solution of the sides of the fissure through which the waters\r\nhave flowed. By these and similar actions, every district in which\r\nlimestones are extensively developed will be found to exhibit\r\na number of natural caves, rents, or fissures. The first element,\r\ntherefore, in the production of cave-deposits, is the existence\r\nof a period in which limestone rocks were largely dissolved, and\r\ncaves were formed in consequence of the then existing drainage\r\ntaking the line of some fissure.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there must have been a period in which various deposits\r\nwere accumulated in the caves thus formed. These cavern-deposits\r\nare of very various nature, consisting of mud, loam, gravel,\r\nor breccias of different kinds. In all cases, these materials\r\nhave been introduced into the cave at some period subsequent to,\r\nor contemporaneous with, the formation of the cave. Sometimes\r\nthe cave communicates with the surface by a fissure through which\r\nsand, gravel, &c., may be washed by rains or by floods from some\r\nneighbouring river. Sometimes the cave has been the bed of an\r\nancient stream, and the deposits have been formed as are fluviatile\r\ndeposits at the surface. Or, again, the river has formerly flowed\r\nat a greater elevation than it does at present, and the cave\r\nhas been filled with fluviatile deposits by the river at a time\r\nprior to the excavation of its bed to the present depth (fig.\r\n256). In this last case, the cave-deposits obviously bear exactly\r\nthe same relation in point of antiquity to recent deposits, as\r\ndo the low-level and high-level valley-gravels to recent\r\nriver-gravels. In any case, it is necessary for the physical\r\ngeography of the district to change to some extent, in order\r\nthat the cave-deposits should be preserved. If the materials\r\nhave been introduced by a fissure, the cave will probably become\r\nultimately filled to the roof, and the aperture of admission\r\nthus blocked up. If a river has flowed through the cave, the\r\nsurface configuration of the district must be altered so far\r\nas to divert the river into a new channel. And if the cave is\r\nplaced in the side of a river-valley, as in fig. 256, the river\r\nmust have excavated its channel to such a depth that it can no\r\nlonger wash out the contents of the cave even in high floods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 256.--Diagrammatic section across a river-valley\r\nand cave. _a a_, Recent valley-gravels near the channel (b) of\r\nthe existing river; c, Cavern, partly filled with cave-earth;\r\n_d d_, High-level gravels, filling fissures in the limestone,\r\nwhich perhaps communicate in some instances with the cave, and\r\nform a channel by which materials of various kinds were introduced\r\ninto it; _e e_, Inclined beds of limestone.]\r\n\r\nIf the cave be entirely filled, the included deposits generally\r\nget more or less completely cemented together by the percolation\r\nthrough them of water holding carbonate of lime in solution. If\r\nthe cave is only partially filled, the dropping of water from\r\nthe roof holding lime in solution, and its subsequent evaporation,\r\nwould lead to the formation over the deposits below of a layer of\r\nstalagmite, perhaps several inches, or even feet, in thickness.\r\nIn this way cave-deposits, with their contained remains, may\r\nbe hermetically sealed up and preserved without injury for an\r\naltogether indefinite period of time.\r\n\r\nIn all caves in limestone in which deposits containing bones are\r\nfound, we have then evidence of three principal sets of changes.\r\n(1.) A period during which the cave was slowly hollowed out by\r\nthe percolation of acidulated water; (2.) A period in which the\r\ncave became the channel of an engulfed river, or otherwise came\r\nto form part of the general drainage-system of the district; (3.)\r\nA period in which the cave was inhabited by various animals.\r\n\r\nAs a typical example of a cave with fossiliferous Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits, we may take Kent's Cavern, near Torquay, in which a\r\nsystematic and careful examination has revealed the following\r\nsequence of accumulations in descending order:--\r\n\r\n(a) Large blocks of limestone, which lie on the floor of the\r\ncave, having fallen from the roof, and which are sometimes cemented\r\ntogether by stalagmite.\r\n\r\n(b) A layer of black mould, from three to twelve inches thick,\r\nwith human bones, fragments of pottery, stone and bronze implements,\r\nand the bones of animals now living in Britain. This, therefore,\r\nis a _recent_ deposit.\r\n\r\n(c) A layer of stalagmite, from sixteen to twenty inches thick,\r\nbut sometimes as much as five feet, containing the bones of Man,\r\ntogether with those of extinct Post-Pliocene Mammals.\r\n\r\n(d) A bed of red cave-earth, sometimes four feet in thickness,\r\nwith numerous bones of extinct Mammals (Mammoth, Cave-bear, &c.),\r\ntogether with human implements of flint and horn.\r\n\r\n(e) A second bed of stalagmite, in places twelve feet in thickness,\r\nwith bones of the Cave-bear.\r\n\r\n(f) A red-loam and cave-breccia, with remains of the Cave-bear\r\nand human implements.\r\n\r\nThe most important Mammals which are found in cave-deposits in\r\nEurope generally, are the Cave-bear, the Cave-lion, the Cave-hyæna,\r\nthe Reindeer, the Musk-ox, the Glutton, and the Lemming--of which\r\nthe first three are probably identical with existing forms, and\r\nthe remainder are certainly so--together with the Mammoth and\r\nthe Woolly Rhinoceros, which are undoubtedly extinct. Along with\r\nthese are found the implements, and in some cases the bones, of\r\nMan himself, in such a manner as to render it absolutely certain\r\nthat an early race of men was truly contemporaneous in Western\r\nEurope with the animals above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIV. UNCLASSIFIED POST-PLIOCENE DEPOSITS.--Apart from any of the\r\nafore mentioned deposits, there occur other accumulations--sometimes\r\nsuperficial, sometimes in caves--which are found in regions where\r\na \"Glacial period\" has not been fully demonstrated, or where\r\nsuch did not take place; and which, therefore, are not amenable\r\nto the above classification. The most important of these are\r\nknown to occur in South America and Australia; and though their\r\nnumerous extinct Mammalia place their reference to the Post-Pliocene\r\nperiod beyond doubt, their relations to the glacial period and\r\nits deposits in the northern hemisphere have not been precisely\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE POST-PLIOCENE PERIOD--_Continued_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _life_ of the Post-Pliocene period, we have, in\r\nthe first place, to notice the effect produced throughout the\r\nnorthern hemisphere by the gradual supervention of the Glacial\r\nperiod. Previous to this the climate must have been temperate or\r\nwarm-temperate; but as the cold gradually came on, two results were\r\nproduced as regards the living beings of the area thus affected.\r\nIn the first place, all those Mammals which, like the Mammoth, the\r\nWoolly Rhinoceros, the Lion, the Hyæna, and the Hippopotamus,\r\nrequire, at any rate, moderately warm conditions, would be forced\r\nto migrate southwards to regions not affected by the new state\r\nof things. In the second place, Mammals previously inhabiting\r\nhigher latitudes, such as the Reindeer, the Musk-ox, and the\r\nLemming, would be enabled by the increasing cold to migrate\r\nsouthwards, and to invade provinces previously occupied by the\r\nElephant and the Rhinoceros. A precisely similar, but more\r\nslowly-executed process, must have taken place in the sea, the\r\nnorthern Mollusca moving southwards as the arctic conditions of\r\nthe Glacial period became established, whilst the forms proper\r\nto temperate seas receded. As regards the readily locomotive\r\nMammals, also, it is probable that this process was carried on\r\nrepeatedly in a partial manner, the southern and northern forms\r\nalternately fluctuating backwards and forwards over the same\r\narea, in accordance with the fluctuations of temperature which\r\nhave been shown by Mr James Geikie to have characterised the\r\nGlacial period as a whole. We can thus readily account for the\r\nintermixture which is sometimes found of northern and southern\r\ntypes of Mammalia in the same deposits, or in deposits apparently\r\nsynchronous, and within a single district. Lastly, at the final close\r\nof the arctic cold of the Glacial period, and the re-establishment\r\nof temperate conditions over the northern hemisphere, a reversal\r\nof the original process took place--the northern Mammals retiring\r\nwithin their ancient limits, and the southern forms pressing\r\nnorthwards and reoccupying their original domains.\r\n\r\nThe _Invertebrate_ animals of the Post-Pliocene deposits require\r\nno further mention--all the known forms, except a few of the shells\r\nin the lowest beds of the formation, being identical with species\r\nnow in existence upon the globe. The only point of importance in\r\nthis connection has been previously noticed--namely, that in\r\nthe true Glacial deposits themselves a considerable number of\r\nthe shells belong to northern or Arctic types.\r\n\r\nAs regards the _Vertebrate_ animals of the period, no extinct\r\nforms of Fishes, Amphibians, or Reptiles are known to occur,\r\nbut we meet with both extinct Birds and extinct Mammals. The\r\nremains of the former are of great interest, as indicating the\r\nexistence during Post-Pliocene times, at widely remote points\r\nof the southern hemisphere, of various wingless, and for the\r\nmost part gigantic, Birds. All the great wingless Birds of the\r\norder _Cursores_ which are known as existing at the present day\r\nupon the globe, are restricted to regions which are either wholly\r\nor in great part south of the equator. Thus the true Ostriches are\r\nAfrican; the Rheas are South American; the Emeus are Australian;\r\nthe Cassowaries are confined to Northern Australia, Papua, and the\r\nIndian Archipelago; the species of _Apteryx_ are natives of New\r\nZealand; and the Dodo and Solitaire (wingless, though probably\r\nnot true _Cursores_), both of which have been exterminated within\r\nhistorical times, were inhabitants of the islands of Mauritius\r\nand Rodriguez, in the Indian Ocean. In view of these facts, it\r\nis noteworthy that, so far as known, all the Cursorial Birds\r\nof the Post-Pliocene period should have been confined to the\r\nsame hemisphere as that inhabited by the living representatives\r\nof the order. It is still further interesting to notice that\r\nthe extinct forms in question are only found in geographical\r\nprovinces which are now, or have been within historical times,\r\ninhabited by similar types. The greater number of the remains\r\nof these have been discovered in New Zealand, where there now\r\nlive several species of the curious wingless genus _Apteryx_;\r\nand they have been referred by Professor Owen to several generic\r\ngroups, of which _Dinornis_ is the most important (fig. 257).\r\nFourteen species of _Dinornis_ have been described by the\r\ndistinguished palæontologist just mentioned, all of them being\r\nlarge wingless birds of the type of the existing Ostrich, having\r\nenormously powerful hind-limbs adapted for running, but with\r\nthe wings wholly rudimentary, and the breast-bone devoid of the\r\nkeel or ridge which characterises this bone in all birds which\r\nfly. The largest species is the _Dinornis giganteus_, one of\r\nthe most gigantic of living or fossil birds, the shank (tibia)\r\nmeasuring a yard in length, and the total height being at least\r\nten feet. Another species, the _Dinornis Elephantopus_ (fig.\r\n257), though not standing more than about six feet in height,\r\nwas of an even more ponderous construction--\"the framework of\r\nthe skeleton being the most massive of any in the whole class of\r\nBirds,\" whilst \"the toe-bones almost rival those of the Elephant\"\r\n(Owen). The feet in _Dinornis_ were furnished with three toes,\r\nand are of interest as presenting us with an undoubted Bird big\r\nenough to produce the largest of the foot-prints of the Triassic\r\nSandstones of Connecticut. New Zealand has now been so far explored,\r\nthat it seems questionable if it can retain in its recesses any\r\nliving example of _Dinornis_; but it is certain that species\r\nof this genus were alive during the human period, and survived\r\nup to quite a recent date. Not only are the bones very numerous\r\nin certain localities, but they are found in the most recent\r\nand superficial deposits, and they still contain a considerable\r\nproportion of animal matter; whilst in some instances bones have\r\nbeen found with the feathers attached, or with the horny skin of\r\nthe legs still adhering to them. Charred bones have been found\r\nin connection with native \"ovens;\" and the traditions of the\r\nMaories contain circumstantial accounts of gigantic wingless\r\nBirds, the \"Moas,\" which were hunted both for their flesh and\r\ntheir plumage. Upon the whole, therefore, there can be no doubt\r\nbut that the Moas of New Zealand have been exterminated at quite a\r\nrecent period--perhaps within the last century--by the unrelenting\r\npursuit of Man,--a pursuit which their wingless condition rendered\r\nthem unable to evade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257.--Skeleton of _Dinornis elephantopus_,\r\ngreatly reduced. Post-Pliocene, New Zealand. (After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nIn Madagascar, bones have been discovered of another huge wingless\r\nBird, which must have been as large as, or larger than, the _Dinornis\r\ngiganteus_, and which has been described under the name of _Æpiornis\r\nmaximus_. With the bones have been found eggs measuring from\r\nthirteen to fourteen inches in diameter, and computed to have\r\nthe capacity of three Ostrich eggs. At least two other smaller\r\nspecies of _Æpiornis_ have been described by Grandidier and\r\nMilne-Edwards as occurring in Madagascar; and they consider the\r\ngenus to be so closely allied to the _Dinornis_ of New Zealand,\r\nas to prove that these regions, now so remote, were at one time\r\nunited by land. Unlike New Zealand, where there is the _Apteryx_,\r\nMadagascar is not known to possess any living wingless Birds;\r\nbut in the neighbouring island of Mauritius the wingless Dodo\r\n(_Didus ineptus_) has been exterminated less than three hundred\r\nyears ago; and the little island of Rodriguez, in the same\r\ngeographical province, has in a similar period lost the equally\r\nwingless Solitaire (_Pezophaps_), both of these, however, being\r\ngenerally referred to the _Rasores_.\r\n\r\nThe _Mammals_ of the Post-Pliocene period are so numerous, that\r\nin spite of the many points of interest which they present, only\r\na few of the more important forms can be noticed here, and that\r\nbut briefly. The first order that claims our attention is that\r\nof the _Marsupials_, the headquarters of which at the present\r\nday is the Australian province. In Oolitic times Europe possessed\r\nits small Marsupials, and similar forms existed in the same area\r\nin the Eocene and Miocene periods; but if size be any criterion,\r\nthe culminating point in the history of the order was attained\r\nduring the Post-Pliocene period in Australia. From deposits of\r\nthis age there has been disentombed a whole series of remains of\r\nextinct, and for the most part gigantic, examples of this group\r\nof Quadrupeds. Not to speak of Wombats and Phalangers, two forms\r\nstand out prominently as representatives of the Post-Pliocene\r\nanimals of Australia. One of these is _Diprotodon_ (fig. 258),\r\nrepresenting, with many differences, the well-known modern group\r\nof the Kangaroos. In its teeth, _Diprotodon_ shows itself to\r\nbe closely allied to the living, grass-eating Kangaroos; but\r\nthe hind-limbs were not so disproportionately long. In size,\r\nalso, _Diprotodon_ must have many times exceeded the dimensions\r\nof the largest of its living successors, since the skull measures\r\nno less than three feet in length. The other form in question\r\nis _Thylacoleo_ (fig. 259), which is believed by Professor Owen\r\nto belong to the same group as the existing \"Native Devil\"\r\n(_Dasyurus_) of Van Diemen's Land, and therefore to have been\r\nflesh-eating and rapacious in its habits, though this view is\r\nnot accepted by others. The principal feature in the skull of\r\n_Thylacoleo_ is the presence, on each side of each jaw, of a\r\nsingle huge tooth, which is greatly compressed, and has a cutting\r\nedge. This tooth is regarded by Owen as corresponding to the\r\ngreat cutting tooth of the jaw of the typical Carnivores, but\r\nProfessor Flower considers that _Thylacoleo_ is rather related to\r\nthe Kangaroo-rats. The size of the crown of the tooth in question\r\nis not less than two inches and a quarter; and whether carnivorous\r\nor not, it indicates an animal of a size exceeding that of the\r\nlargest of existing Lions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258.--Skull of _Diprotodon Australis_, greatly\r\nreduced. Post-Pliocene, Australia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259.--Skull of _Thylacoleo_. Post-Pliocene,\r\nAustralia. Greatly reduced. (After Flower.)]\r\n\r\nThe order of the _Edentates_, comprising the existing Sloths,\r\nAnt-eaters, and Armadillos, and entirely restricted at the present\r\nday to South America, Southern Asia, and Africa, is one alike\r\nsingular for the limited geographical range of its members, their\r\ncurious habits of life, and the well-marked peculiarities of\r\ntheir anatomical structure. South America is the metropolis of\r\nthe existing forms; and it is an interesting fact that there\r\nflourished within Post-Pliocene times in this continent, and to\r\nsome extent in North America also, a marvellous group of extinct\r\nEdentates, representing the living Sloths and Armadillos, but\r\nof gigantic size. The most celebrated of these is the huge\r\n_Megatherium Cuvieri_ (fig. 260) of the South American Pampas.\r\nThe Megathere was a colossal Sloth-like animal which attained a\r\nlength of from twelve to eighteen feet, with bones more massive\r\nthan those of the Elephant. Thus the thigh-bone is nearly thrice\r\nthe thickness of the same bone in the largest of existing Elephants,\r\nits circumference at its narrowest point nearly equalling its\r\ntotal length; the massive bones of the shank (tibia and fibula)\r\nare amalgamated at their extremities; the heel-bone (calcaneum)\r\nis nearly half a yard in length; the haunch-bones (ilia) are\r\nfrom four to five feet across at their crests; and the bodies\r\nof the vertebræ at the root of the tail are from five to seven\r\ninches in diameter, from which it has been computed that the\r\ncircumference of the tail at this part might have been from five\r\nto six feet. The length of the fore-foot is about a yard, and\r\nthe toes are armed with powerful curved claws. It is known now\r\nthat the Megathere, in spite of its enormous weight and ponderous\r\nconstruction, walked, like the existing Ant-eaters and Sloths,\r\nupon the outside edge of the fore-feet, with the claws more or\r\nless bent inwards towards the palm of the hand. As in the great\r\nmajority of the Edentate order, incisor and canine teeth are\r\nentirely wanting, the front of the jaws being toothless. The\r\njaws, however, are furnished with five upper and four lower molar\r\nteeth on each side. These grinding teeth are from seven to eight\r\ninches in length, in the form of four-sided prisms, the crowns of\r\nwhich are provided with well-marked transverse ridges; and they\r\ncontinue to grow during the whole life of the animal. There are\r\nindications that the snout was prolonged, and more or less flexible;\r\nand the tongue was probably prehensile. From the characters of\r\nthe molar teeth it is certain that the Megathere was purely\r\nherbivorous in its habits; and from the enormous size and weight\r\nof the body, it is equally certain that it could not have imitated\r\nits modern allies, the Sloths, in the feat of climbing, back\r\ndownwards, amongst the trees. It is clear, therefore, that the\r\nMegathere sought its sustenance upon the ground; and it was\r\noriginally supposed to have lived upon roots. By a masterly piece\r\nof deductive reasoning, however, Professor Owen showed that this\r\ngreat \"Ground-Sloth\" must have truly lived upon the foliage of\r\ntrees, like the existing Sloths--but with this difference, that\r\ninstead of climbing amongst the branches, it actually uprooted\r\nthe tree bodily. In this _tour de force_, the animal sat upon its\r\nhuge haunches and mighty tail, as on a tripod, and then grasping\r\nthe trunk with its powerful arms, either wrenched it up by the\r\nroots or broke it short off above the ground. Marvellous as this\r\nmay seem, it can be shown that every detail in the skeleton of the\r\nMegathere accords with the supposition that it obtained its food\r\nin this way. Similar habits were followed by the allied _Mylodon_\r\n(fig. 261), another of the great \"Ground-Sloths,\" which inhabited\r\nSouth America during the Post-Pliocene period. In most respects,\r\nthe _Mylodon_ is very like the Megathere; but the crowns of the\r\nmolar teeth are flat instead of being ridged. The nearly-related\r\ngenus _Megalonyx_, unlike the Megathere, but like the Mylodon,\r\nextended its range northwards as far as the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260.--_Megatherium Cuvieri_. Post-Pliocene,\r\nSouth America.]\r\n\r\nJust as the Sloths of the present day were formerly represented\r\nin the same geographical area by the gigantic Megatheroids, so\r\nthe little banded and cuirassed Armadillos of South America were\r\nformerly represented by gigantic species, constituting the genus\r\n_Glyptodon_. The _Glyptodons_ (fig. 262) differed from the living\r\nArmadillos in having no bands in their armour, so that they must\r\nhave been unable to roll themselves up. It is rare at the present\r\nday to meet with any Armadillo over two or three feet in length;\r\nbut the length of the _Glyptodon clavipes_, from the tip of the\r\nsnout to the end of the tail, was more than nine feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261.--Skeleton of _Mylodon robustus_.\r\nPost-Pliocene, South America.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262.--Skeleton of _Glyptodon clavipes_.\r\nPost-Pliocene, South America.]\r\n\r\nThere are no canine or incisor teeth in the _Glyptodon_, but\r\nthere are eight molars on each side of each jaw, and the crowns\r\nof these are fluted and almost trilobed. The head is covered\r\nby a helmet of bony plates, and the trunk was defended by an\r\narmour of almost hexagonal bony pieces united by sutures, and\r\nexhibiting special patterns of sculpturing in each species. The\r\ntail was also defended by a similar armour, and the vertebræ were\r\nmostly fused together so as to form a cylindrical bony rod. In\r\naddition to the above-mentioned forms, a number of other Edentate\r\nanimals have been discovered by the researches of M. Lund in\r\nthe Post-Pliocene deposits of the Brazilian bone-caves. Amongst\r\nthese are true Ant-eaters, Armadillos, and Sloths, many of them\r\nof gigantic size, and all specifically or generically distinct\r\nfrom existing forms.\r\n\r\nPassing over the aquatic orders of the _Sirenians_ and _Cetaceans_,\r\nwe come next to the great group of the Hoofed Quadrupeds, the\r\nremains of which are very abundant in Post-Pliocene deposits both\r\nin Europe and North America. Amongst the Odd-toed Ungulates the\r\nmost important are the Rhinoceroses, of which three species are\r\nknown to have existed in Europe during the Post-Pliocene period.\r\nTwo of these are the well-known Pliocene forms, the _Rhinoceros\r\nEtruscus_ and the _R. Megarhinus_ still surviving in diminished\r\nnumbers; but the most famous is the _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_\r\n(fig. 263), or so-called \"Woolly Rhinoceros.\" This species is\r\nknown not only by innumerable bones, but also by a carcass, at\r\nthe time of its discovery complete, which was found embedded in\r\nthe frozen soil of Siberia towards the close of last century,\r\nand which was partly saved from destruction by the exertions of\r\nthe naturalist Pallas. From this, we know that the Tichorhine\r\nRhinoceros, like its associate the Mammoth, was provided with\r\na coating of hair, and therefore was enabled to endure a more\r\nsevere climate than any existing species. The skin was not thrown\r\ninto the folds which characterise most of the existing forms;\r\nand the technical name of the species refers to the fact that\r\nthe nostrils were completely separated by a bony partition. The\r\nhead carried two horns, placed one behind the other, the front\r\none being unusually large. As regards its geographical range,\r\nthe Woolly Rhinoceros is found in Europe in vast numbers north\r\nof the Alps and Pyrenees, and it also abounded in Siberia; so\r\nthat it would appear to be a distinctly northern form, and to\r\nhave been adapted for a temperate climate. It is not known to\r\noccur in Pliocene deposits, but it makes its first appearance\r\nin the Pre-Glacial deposits, surviving the Glacial period, and\r\nbeing found in abundance in Post-Glacial accumulations. It was\r\nundoubtedly a contemporary of the earlier races of men in Western\r\nEurope; and it may perhaps be regarded as being the actual\r\nsubstantial kernel of some of the \"Dragons\" of fable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 263.--Skull of the Tichorhine Rhinoceros, the\r\nhorns being wanting. One-tenth of the natural size. Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits of Europe and Asia.]\r\n\r\nThe only other Odd-toed Ungulate which needs notice is the so-called\r\n_Equus fossilis_ of the Post-Pliocene of Europe. This made its\r\nappearance before the Glacial period, and appears to be in reality\r\nidentical with the existing Horse (_Equus caballus_). True Horses\r\nalso occur in the Post-Pliocene of North America; but, from some\r\ncause or another, they must have been exterminated before historic\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 264--Skeleton of the \"Irish Elk\" (_Cervus\r\nmegaceros_). Post-Pliocene, Britain.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Even-toed Ungulates, the great _Hippopotamus major_\r\nof the Pliocene still continued to exist in Post-Pliocene times\r\nin Western Europe; and the existing Wild Boar (_Sus scrofa_),\r\nthe parent of our domestic breeds of Pigs, appeared for the first\r\ntime. The Old World possessed extinct representatives of its\r\nexisting Camels, and lost types of the living Llamas inhabited\r\nSouth America. Amongst the Deer, the Post-Pliocene accumulations\r\nhave yielded the remains of various living species, such as the\r\nRed Deer (_Cervus elaphus_), the Reindeer (_Cervus tarandus_),\r\nthe Moose or Elk (_Alces malchis_), and the Roebuck (_Cervus\r\ncapreolus_), together with a number of extinct forms. Among the\r\nlatter, the great \"Irish Elk\" (_Cervus megaceros_) is justly\r\ncelebrated both for its size and for the number and excellent\r\npreservation of its discovered remains. This extinct species\r\n(fig. 264) has been found principally in peat-mosses and\r\nPost-Pliocene lake-deposits, and is remarkable for the enormous\r\nsize of the spreading antlers, which are widened out towards\r\ntheir extremities, and attain an expanse of over ten feet from\r\ntip to tip. It is not a genuine Elk, but is intermediate between\r\nthe Reindeer and the Fallow-deer. Among the existing Deer of the\r\nPost-Pliocene, the most noticeable is the Reindeer, an essentially\r\nnorthern type, existing at the present day in Northern Europe,\r\nand also (under the name of the \"Caribou\") in North America. When\r\nthe cold of the Glacial period became established, this boreal\r\nspecies was enabled to invade Central and Western Europe in great\r\nherds, and its remains are found abundantly in cave-earths and\r\nother Post-Pliocene deposits as far south as the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 265.--Skull of the Urns (_Bos primigenius_).\r\nPost-Pliocene and Recent. (After Owen.)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the Post-Pliocene deposits of Europe\r\nand North America have yielded the remains of various Sheep and\r\nOxen. One of the most interesting of the latter is the \"Urus\" or\r\nWild Bull (_Bos primigenius_, fig. 265), which, though much larger\r\nthan any of the existing fossils, is believed to be specifically\r\nundistinguishable from the domestic Ox (_Bos taurus_), and to be\r\npossibly the ancestor of some of the larger European varieties\r\nof oxen. In the earlier part of its existence the Urus ranged\r\nover Europe and Britain in company with the Woolly Rhinoceros\r\nand the Mammoth; but it long survived these, and does not appear\r\nto have been finally exterminated till about the twelfth century.\r\nAnother remarkable member of the Post-Pliocene Cattle, also to\r\nbegin with an associate of the Mammoth and Rhinoceros, is the\r\nEuropean Bison or \"Aurochs\" (_Bison priscus_). This \"maned\" ox\r\nformerly abounded in Europe in Post-Glacial times, and was not\r\nrare even in the later periods of the Roman empire, though much\r\ndiminished in numbers, and driven back into the wilder and more\r\ninaccessible parts of the country. At present this fine species\r\nhas been so nearly exterminated that it no longer exists in Europe\r\nsave in Lithuania, where its preservation has been secured by\r\nrigid protective laws. Lastly, the Post-Pliocene deposits have\r\nyielded the remains of the singular living animal which is known\r\nas the Musk-ox or Musk-sheep (_Ovibos moschatus_). At the present\r\nday, the Musk-ox is an inhabitant of the \"barren grounds\" of\r\nArctic America, and it is remarkable for the great length of\r\nits hair. It is, like the Reindeer, a distinctively northern\r\nanimal; but it enjoyed during the Glacial period a much wider\r\nrange than it has at the present day, the conditions suitable\r\nfor its existence being then extended over a considerable portion\r\nof the northern hemisphere. Thus remains of the Musk-Ox are found\r\nin greater or less abundance in Post-Pliocene deposits over a\r\ngreat part of Europe, extending even to the south of France;\r\nand closely-related forms are found in similar deposits in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 266.--Skeleton of the Mammoth (_Elephas\r\nprimigenius_). Portions of the integument still adhere to the\r\nhead, and the thick skin of the soles is still attached to the\r\nfeet. Post-Pliocene.]\r\n\r\nComing to the _Proboscideans_, we find that the _Mastodons_ seem\r\nto have disappeared in Europe at the close of the Pliocene period,\r\nor at the very commencement of the Post-Pliocene. In the New World,\r\non the other hand, a species of Mastodon (_M. Americanus_ or _M.\r\nOhioticus_) is found abundantly in deposits of Post-Pliocene\r\nage, from Canada to Texas. Very perfect skeletons of this species\r\nhave been exhumed from morasses and swamps, and large individuals\r\nattained a length (exclusive of the tusks) of seventeen feet and\r\na height of eleven feet, the tusks being twelve feet in length.\r\nRemains of _Elephants_ are also abundant in the Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits of both the Old and the New World. Amongst these, we\r\nfind in Europe the two familiar Pliocene species _E. Meridionales_\r\nand _E. Antiquus_ still surviving, but in diminished numbers.\r\nWith these are found in vast abundance the remains of the\r\ncharacteristic Elephant of the Post-Pliocene, the well-known\r\n\"Mammoth\" (Elephas primigenius_), which is accompanied in North\r\nAmerica by the nearly-allied, but more southern species, the\r\n_Elephas Americanus_. The Mammoth (fig. 266) is considerably\r\nlarger than the largest of the living Elephants, the skeleton\r\nbeing over sixteen feet in length, exclusive of the tusks, and\r\nover nine feet in height. The tusks are bent almost into a circle,\r\nand are sometimes twelve feet in length, measured along their\r\ncurvature. In the frozen soil of Siberia several carcasses of\r\nthe Mammoth have been discovered with the flesh and skin still\r\nattached to the bones, the most celebrated of these being a Mammoth\r\nwhich was discovered at the beginning of this century at the\r\nmouth of the Lena, on the borders of the Frozen Sea, and the\r\nskeleton of which is now preserved at St Petersburg (fig. 266).\r\nFrom the occurrence of the remains of the Mammoth in vast numbers\r\nin Siberia, it might have been safely inferred that this ancient\r\nElephant was able to endure a far more rigorous climate than its\r\nexisting congeners. This inference has, however, been rendered\r\na certainty by the specimens just referred to, which show that\r\nthe Mammoth was protected against the cold by a thick coat of\r\nreddish-brown wool, some nine or ten inches long, interspersed\r\nwith strong, coarse black hair more than a foot in length. The\r\nteeth of the Mammoth (fig.267) are of the type of those of the\r\nexisting Indian Elephant, and are found in immense numbers in\r\ncertain localities. The Mammoth was essentially northern in its\r\ndistribution, never passing south of a line drawn through the\r\nPyrenees, the Alps, the northern shores of the Caspian, Lake\r\nBaikal, Kamschatka, and the Stanovi Mountains (Dawkins). It occurs\r\nin the Pre-Glacial forest-bed of Cromer in Norfolk, survived the\r\nGlacial period, and is found abundantly in Post-Glacial deposits\r\nin France, Germany, Britain, Russia in Europe, Asia, and North\r\nAmerica, being often associated with the Reindeer, Lemming, and\r\nMusk-ox. That it survived into the earlier portion of the human\r\nperiod is unquestionable, its remains having been found in a\r\ngreat number of instances associated with implements of human\r\nmanufacture; whilst in one instance a recognisable portrait of\r\nit has been discovered, carved on bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 267.--Molar tooth of the Mammoth (_Elephas\r\nprimigenius_), upper jaw, right side, one-third of the natural\r\nsize. a, Grinding surface; b, Side view. Post-Pliocene.]\r\n\r\nAmongst other Elephants which occur in Post-Pliocene deposits\r\nmay be mentioned, as of special interest, the pigmy Elephants\r\nof Malta. One of these--the _Elephas Melitensis_, or so-called\r\n\"Donkey-Elephant\"--was not more than four and a half feet in\r\nheight. The other--the _Elephas Falconeri_, of Busk--was still\r\nsmaller, its average height at the withers not exceeding two\r\nand a half to three feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268.--Skull of _Ursus spelpeus_. Post-Pliocene,\r\nEurope. One-sixth of the natural size.]\r\n\r\nWhilst herbivorous animals abounded during the Post-Pliocene,\r\nwe have ample evidence of the coexistence with them of a number\r\nof Carnivorous forms, both in the New and the Old World. The\r\nBears are represented in Europe by at least three species, two\r\nof which--namely, the great Grizzly Bear (_Ursus ferox_) and\r\nthe smaller Brown Bear (_Ursus arctos_)--are in existence at the\r\npresent day. The third species is the celebrated Cave-bear (_Ursus\r\nspeloeus_, fig. 268), which is now extinct. The Cave-bear exceeded\r\nin its dimensions the largest of modern Bears; and its remains,\r\nas its name implies; have been found mainly in cavern-deposits.\r\nEnormous numbers of this large and ferocious species must have\r\nlived in Europe in Post-Glacial times; and that they survived\r\ninto the human period, is clearly shown by the common association\r\nof their bones with the implements of man. They are occasionally\r\naccompanied by the remains of a Glutton (the _Gulo speloeus_),\r\nwhich does not appear to be really separable from the existing\r\nWolverine or Glutton of northern regions (the _Gulo luscus_).\r\nIn addition, we meet with the bones of the Wolf, Fox, Weasel,\r\nOtter, Badger, Wild Cat, Panther, Hyæna, and Lion, &c., together\r\nwith the extinct _Machairodus_ or \"Sabre-toothed Tiger.\" The\r\nonly two of these that deserve further mention are the Hyæna\r\nand the Lion. The Cave-hyæna (_Hyoena speloea_, fig. 269) is\r\nregarded by high authorities as nothing more than a variety of\r\nthe living Spotted Hyæna (_H. Crocuta_) of South Africa. This\r\nwell-known species inhabited Britain and a considerable portion\r\nof Europe during a large part of the Post-Pliocene period; and\r\nits remains often occur in great abundance. Indeed, some caves,\r\nsuch as the Kirkdale Cavern in Yorkshire, were dens inhabited\r\nduring long periods by these animals, and thus contain the remains\r\nof numerous individuals and of successive generations of Hyænas,\r\ntogether with innumerable gnawed and bitten bones of their prey.\r\nThat the Cave-hyæna was a contemporary with Man in Western Europe\r\nduring Post-Glacial times is shown beyond a doubt by the common\r\nassociation of its bones with human implements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269.--Skull of _Hyoena speloea_, one-fourth\r\nof the natural size. Post-Phocene, Europe.]\r\n\r\nLastly, the so-called Cave-lion (_Felis speloea_), long supposed\r\nto be a distinct species, has been shown to be nothing more than\r\na large variety of the existing Lion (_Felis leo_). This animal\r\ninhabited Britain and Western Europe in times posterior to the\r\nGlacial period, and was a contemporary of the Cave-hyæna, Cave-bear,\r\nWoolly Rhinoceros, and Mammoth. The Cave-lion also unquestionably\r\nsurvived into the earlier portion of the human period in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Pliocene deposits of Europe have further yielded the\r\nremains of numerous _Rodents_--such as the Beaver, the Northern\r\nLemming, Marmots, Mice, Voles, Rabbits, &c.--together with the\r\ngigantic extinct Beaver known as the _Trogontherium Cuvieri_\r\n(fig. 270). The great _Castoroides Ohioensis_ of the Post-Pliocene\r\nof North America is also a great extinct Beaver, which reached\r\na length of about five feet. Lastly, the Brazilian bone-caves\r\nhave yielded the remains of numerous Rodents of types now\r\ncharacteristic of South America, such as Guinea-pigs, Capybaras,\r\ntree-inhabiting Porcupines, and Coypus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270.--Lower jaw of _Trogontherium Cuvieri_,\r\none-fourth of the natural size. Post-Pliocene, Britain.]\r\n\r\nThe deposits just alluded to have further yielded the remains of\r\nvarious Monkeys, such as Howling Monkeys, Squirrel Monkeys, and\r\nMarmosets, all of which belong to the group of _Quadrumana_ which\r\nis now exclusively confined to the South American continent--namely,\r\nthe \"Platyrhine\" Monkeys.\r\n\r\nWe still have very briefly to consider the occurrence of Man\r\nin Post-Pliocene deposits; but before doing so, it will be well\r\nto draw attention to the evidence afforded by the Post-Pliocene\r\nMammals as to the climate of Western Europe at this period. The\r\nchief point which we have to notice is, that a considerable\r\nrevolution of opinion has taken place on this point. It was\r\noriginally believed that the presence of such animals as Elephants,\r\nLions, the Rhinoceros, and the Hippopotamus afforded an irrefragable\r\nproof that the climate of Europe must have been a warm one, at any\r\nrate during Post-Glacial times. The existence, also, of numbers\r\nof Mammoths in Siberia, was further supposed to indicate that\r\nthis high temperature extended itself very far north. Upon the\r\nwhole, however, the evidence is against this view. Not only is\r\nthere great difficulty in supposing that the Arctic conditions of\r\nthe Glacial period were immediately followed by anything warmer\r\nthan a cold-temperate climate; but there is nothing in the nature\r\nof the Mammals themselves which would absolutely forbid their\r\nliving in a temperate climate. The _Hippopotamus major_, though\r\nprobably clad in hair, offers some difficulty--since, as pointed\r\nout by Professor Busk, it must have required a climate sufficiently\r\nwarm to insure that the rivers were not frozen over in the winter;\r\nbut it was probably a migratory animal, and its occurrence may\r\nbe accounted for by this. The Woolly Rhinoceros and the Mammoth\r\nare known with certainty to have been protected with a thick\r\ncovering of wool and hair; and their extension northwards need\r\nnot necessarily have been limited by anything except the absence of\r\na sufficiently luxuriant vegetation to afford them food. The great\r\nAmerican Mastodon, though not certainly known to have possessed a\r\nhairy covering, has been shown to have lived upon the shoots of\r\nSpruce and Firs, trees characteristic of temperate regions--as\r\nshown by the undigested food which has been found with its skeleton,\r\noccupying the place of the stomach. The Lions and Hyænas, again,\r\nas shown by Professor Boyd Dawkins, do not indicate necessarily\r\na warm climate. Wherever a sufficiency of herbivorous animals\r\nto supply them with food can live, there they can live also;\r\nand they have therefore no special bearing upon the question of\r\nclimate. After a review of the whole evidence, Professor Dawkins\r\nconcludes that the nearest approach at the present day to the\r\nPost-Pliocene climate of Western Europe is to be found in the\r\nclimate of the great Siberian plains which stretch from the Altai\r\nMountains to the Frozen Sea. \"Covered by impenetrable forests,\r\nfor the most part of Birch, Poplar, Larch, and Pines, and low\r\ncreeping dwarf Cedars, they present every gradation in climate\r\nfrom the temperate to that in which the cold is too severe to admit\r\nof the growth of trees, which decrease in size as the traveller\r\nadvances northwards, and are replaced by the grey mosses and\r\nlichens that cover the low marshy 'tundras.' The maximum winter\r\ncold, registered by Admiral Von Wrangel at Nishne Kolymsk, on\r\nthe banks of the Kolyma, is--65° in January. 'Then breathing\r\nbecomes difficult; the Reindeer, that citizen of the Polar region,\r\nwithdraws to the deepest thicket of the forest, and stands there\r\nmotionless as if deprived of life;' and trees burst asunder with\r\nthe cold. Throughout this area roam Elks, Black Bears, Foxes,\r\nSables, and Wolves, that afford subsistence to the Jakutian and\r\nTungusian fur-hunters. In the northern part countless herds of\r\nReindeer, Elks, Foxes, and Wolverines make up for the poverty\r\nof vegetation by the rich abundance of animal life. 'Enormous\r\nflights of Swans, Geese, and Ducks arrive in the spring, and seek\r\ndeserts where they may moult and build their nests in safety.\r\nPtarmigans run in troops amongst the bushes; little Snipes are\r\nbusy along the brooks and in the morasses; the social Crows seek\r\nthe neighbourhood of new habitations; and when the sun shines\r\nin spring, one may even sometimes hear the cheerful note of the\r\nFinch, and in autumn that of the Thrush.' Throughout this region\r\nof woods, a hardy, middle-sized breed of horses lives under the\r\nmastership and care of man, and is eminently adapted to bear the\r\nseverity of the climate.... The only limit to their northern\r\nrange is the difficulty of obtaining food. The severity of the\r\nwinter through the southern portion of this vast wooded area is\r\nalmost compensated for by the summer heat and its marvellous\r\neffect on vegetation.\"--(Dawkins, 'Monograph of Pleistocene\r\nMammalia.')\r\n\r\nFinally, a few words must be said as to the occurrence of the\r\nremains of Man in Post-Pliocene deposits. That Man existed in\r\nWestern Europe and in Britain during the Post-Pliocene period, is\r\nplaced beyond a doubt by the occurrence of his bones in deposits\r\nof this age, along with the much more frequent occurrence of\r\nimplements of human manufacture. At what precise point of time\r\nduring the Post-Pliocene period he first made his appearance is\r\nstill a matter of conjecture. Recent researches would render\r\nit probable that the early inhabitants of Britain and Western\r\nEurope were witnesses of the stupendous phenomena of the Glacial\r\nperiod; but this cannot be said to have been demonstrated. That\r\nMan existed in these regions during the Post-Glacial division\r\nof Post-Pliocene time cannot be doubted for a moment. As to the\r\nphysical peculiarities of the ancient races that lived with the\r\nMammoth and the Woolly Rhinoceros, little is known compared with\r\nwhat we may some day hope to know. Such information as we have,\r\nhowever, based principally on the skulls of the Engis, Neanderthal,\r\nCro-Magnon, and Bruniquel caverns, would lead to the conclusion that\r\nPost-Pliocene Man was in no respect inferior in his organisation\r\nto, or less highly developed than, many existing races. All the\r\nknown skulls of this period, with the single exception of the\r\nNeanderthal cranium, are in all respects average and normal in\r\ntheir characters; and even the Neanderthal skull possessed a\r\ncubic capacity at least equal to that of some existing races.\r\nThe implements of Post-Pliocene Man are exclusively of stone or\r\nbone; and the former are invariably of rude shape and _undressed_.\r\nThese \"palæolithic\" tools (Gr. _palaios_; ancient; _lithos_,\r\nstone) point to a very early condition of the arts; since the\r\nmen of the earlier portion of the Recent period, though likewise\r\nunacquainted with the metals, were in the habit of polishing\r\nor dressing the stone implements which they fabricated.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to enter further into this subject; and\r\nit would be useless to do so without entering as well into a\r\nconsideration of the human remains of the Recent period--a period\r\nwhich lies outside the province of the present work. So far as\r\nPost-Pliocene Man is concerned, the chief points which the\r\npalæontological student has to remember have been elsewhere\r\nsummarised by the author as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Man unquestionably existed during the later portion of what\r\nSir Charles Lyell has termed the \"Post-Pliocene\" period. In other\r\nwords, Man's existence dates back to a time when several remarkable\r\nMammals, previously mentioned, had not yet become extinct; but he\r\ndoes not date back to a time anterior to the present _Molluscan_\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\n2. The antiquity of the so-called Post-Pliocene period is a matter\r\nwhich must be mainly settled by the evidence of Geology proper,\r\nand need not be discussed here.\r\n\r\n3. The extinct Mammals with which man coexisted in Western Europe are\r\nmostly of large size, the most important being the Mammoth (_Elephas\r\nprimogenius_), the Woolly Rhinoceros (_Rhinoceros tichorhinus_),\r\nthe Cave-lion (_Felis speloea_), the Cave-hyæna(_Hyoena speloea),\r\nand the Cave-bear (_Ursus speloeus_). We do not know the causes\r\nwhich led to the extinction of these Mammals; but we know that\r\nhardly any Mammalian species has become extinct during the historical\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n4. The extinct Mammals with which man coexisted are referable in\r\nmany cases to species which presumably required a very different\r\nclimate to that now prevailing in Western Europe. How long a\r\nperiod, however, has been consumed in the bringing about of the\r\nclimatic changes thus indicated, we have no means of calculating\r\nwith any approach to accuracy.\r\n\r\n5. Some of the deposits in which the remains of man have been\r\nfound associated with the bones of extinct Mammals, are such as\r\nto show incontestably that great changes in the physical geography\r\nand surface-configuration of Western Europe have taken place\r\nsince the period of their accumulation. We have, however, no\r\nmeans at present of judging of the lapse of time thus indicated\r\nexcept by analogies and comparisons which may be disputed.\r\n\r\n6. The human implements which are associated with the remains\r\nof extinct Mammals, themselves bear evidence of an exceedingly\r\nbarbarous condition of the human species. Post-Pliocene or\r\n\"Palæolithic\" Man was clearly unacquainted with the use of any\r\nof the metals. Not only so, but the workmanship of these ancient\r\nraces was much inferior to that of the later tribes, who were also\r\nignorant of the metals, and who also used nothing but weapons\r\nand tools of stone, bone, &c.\r\n\r\n7. Lastly, it is only with the human remains of the Post-Pliocene\r\nperiod that the palæontologist proper has to deal. When we enter\r\nthe \"Recent\" period, in which the remains of Man are associated\r\nwith those of _existing species of Mammals_, we pass out of the\r\nregion of pure palæontology into the domain of the Archæologist\r\nand the Ethnologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the principal works and memoirs to which\r\nthe student may refer for information as to the Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits and the remains which they contain, as well as to the\r\nprimitive races of mankind:--\r\n\r\n (1) 'Elements of Geology.'

That there was a time when the earth was\r\nvoid of life is universally admitted, though it may be that the\r\ngeological record gives us no direct evidence of this. That the\r\nglobe of to-day is peopled with innumerable forms of life whose\r\nterm of existence has been, for the most part, but as it were\r\nof yesterday, is likewise an assertion beyond dispute. Can we\r\nin any way connect the present with the remote past, and can we\r\nindicate even imperfectly the conditions and laws under which the\r\nexisting order was brought about? The long series of fossiliferous\r\ndeposits, with their almost countless organic remains, is the\r\nlink between what has been and what is; and if any answer to the\r\nabove question can be arrived at, it will be by the careful and\r\nconscientious study of the facts of Palæontology. In the present\r\nstate of our knowledge, it may be safely said that anything like\r\na dogmatic or positive opinion as to the precise sequence of\r\nliving forms upon the globe, and still more as to the manner in\r\nwhich this sequence may have been brought about, is incapable of\r\nscientific proof. There are, however, certain general deductions\r\nfrom the known facts which may be regarded as certainly established.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is certain that there has been a _succession_\r\nof life upon the earth, different specific and generic types\r\nsucceeding one another in successive periods. It follows from\r\nthis, that the animals and plants with which we are familiar\r\nas living, were not always upon the earth, but that they have\r\nbeen preceded by numerous races more or less differing from them.\r\nWhat is true of the species of animals and plants, is true also\r\nof the higher zoological divisions; and it is, in the second\r\nplace, quite certain that there has been a similar _succession_\r\nin the order of appearance of the primary groups (\"sub-kingdoms,\"\r\n\"classes,\" &c.) of animals and vegetables. These great groups\r\ndid not all come into existence at once, but they made their\r\nappearance successively. It is true that we cannot be said to\r\nbe certainly acquainted with the first _absolute_ appearance of\r\nany great group of animals. No one dare assert positively that\r\nthe apparent first appearance of Fishes in the Upper Silurian\r\nis really their first introduction upon the earth: indeed, there\r\nis a strong probability against any such supposition. To whatever\r\nextent, however, future discoveries may push back the first advent\r\nof any or of all of the great groups of life, there is no likelihood\r\nthat anything will be found out which will materially alter the\r\n_relative_ succession of these groups as at present known to us.\r\nIt is not likely, for example, that the future has in store for\r\nus any discovery by which it would be shown that Fishes were in\r\nexistence before Molluscs, or that Mammals made their appearance\r\nbefore Fishes. The sub-kingdoms of Invertebrate animals were\r\nall represented in Cambrian times--and it might therefore be\r\ninferred that _these_ had all come simultaneously into existence;\r\nbut it is clear that this inference, though incapable of actual\r\ndisproof, is in the last degree improbable. Anterior to the Cambrian\r\nis the great series of the Laurentian, which, owing to the\r\nmetamorphism to which it has been subjected, has so far yielded\r\nbut the singular _Eozoön_. We may be certain, however, that others\r\nof the Invertebrate sub-kingdoms besides the Protozoa were in\r\nexistence in the Laurentian period; and we may infer from known\r\nanalogies that they appeared successively, and not simultaneously.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to smaller divisions than the sub-kingdoms--such\r\nas classes, orders, and families--a similar succession of groups\r\nis observable. The different classes of any given sub-kingdom,\r\nor the different orders of any given class, do not make their\r\nappearance together and all at once, but they are introduced\r\nupon the earth in _succession_. More than this, the different\r\nclasses of a sub-kingdom, or the different orders of a class,\r\n_in the main succeed one another in the relative order of their\r\nzoological rank--the lower groups appearing first and the higher\r\ngroups last_. It is true that in the Cambrian formation--the\r\nearliest series of sediments in which fossils are abundant--we\r\nfind numerous groups, some very low, others very high, in the\r\nzoological scale, which _appear_ to have simultaneously flashed\r\ninto existence. For reasons stated above, however, we cannot\r\naccept this appearance as real; and we must believe that many of\r\nthe Cambrian groups of animals really came into being long before\r\nthe commencement of the Cambrian period. At any rate, in the long\r\nseries of fossiliferous deposits of later date than the Cambrian\r\nthe above-stated rule holds good as a broad generalisation--that\r\nthe lower groups, namely, precede the higher in point of time;\r\nand though there are apparent exceptions to the rule, there are\r\nnone of such a nature as not to admit of explanation. Some of\r\nthe leading facts upon which this generalisarion is founded will\r\nbe enumerated immediately; but it will be well, in the first\r\nplace, to consider briefly what we precisely mean when we speak\r\nof \"higher\" and \"lower\" groups.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that naturalists are in the habit of \"classifying\"\r\nthe innumerable animals which now exist upon the globe; or, in\r\nother words, of systematically arranging them into groups. The\r\nprecise arrangement adopted by one naturalist may differ in minor\r\ndetails from that adopted by another; but all are agreed as to\r\nthe fundamental points of classification, and all, therefore,\r\nagree in placing certain groups in a certain sequence. What,\r\nthen, is the principle upon which this sequence is based? Why,\r\nfor example, are the Sponges placed below the Corals; these below\r\nthe Sea-urchins; and these, again, below the Shell-fish? Without\r\nentering into a discussion of the principles of zoological\r\nclassification, which would here be out of place, it must be\r\nsufficient to say that the sequence in question is based upon\r\nthe _relative type of organisation_ of the groups of animals\r\nclassified. The Corals are placed above the Sponges upon the\r\nground that, regarded as a whole, the _plan or type of structure_\r\nof a Coral is more complex than that of a Sponge. It is not in the\r\nslightest degree that the Sponge is in any respect less highly\r\norganised or less perfect, as a Sponge, than is the Coral as a\r\nCoral. Each is equally perfect in its own way; but the structural\r\npattern of the Coral is the highest, and therefore it occupies a\r\nhigher place in the zoological scale. It is upon this principle,\r\nthen, that the primary subdivisions of the animal kingdom (the\r\nso-called \"sub-kingdoms\") are arranged in a certain order. Coming,\r\nagain, to the minor subdivisions (classes, orders, &c.) of each\r\nsub-kingdom, we find a different but entirely analogous principle\r\nemployed as a means of classification. The numerous animals belonging\r\nto any given sub-kingdom are formed upon the same fundamental\r\nplan of structure; but they nevertheless admit of being arranged\r\nin a regular series of groups. All the Shell-fish, for example,\r\nare built upon a common plan, this plan representing the ideal\r\nMollusc; but there are at the same time various groups of the\r\n_Mollusca_, and these groups admit of an arrangement in a given\r\nsequence. The principle adopted in this case is simply of _the\r\nrelative elaboration of the common type_. The Oyster is built\r\nupon the same ground-plan as the Cuttle-fish; but this plan is\r\ncarried out with much greater elaboration, and with many more\r\ncomplexities, in the latter than in the former: and in accordance\r\nwith this, the _Cephalopoda_ constitute a higher group than the\r\nBivalve Shell-fish. As in the case of superiority of structural\r\ntype, so in this case also, it is not in the least that the Oyster\r\nis an _imperfect_ animal. On the contrary, it is just as perfectly\r\nadapted by its organisation to fill its own sphere and to meet\r\nthe exigencies of its own existence as is the Cuttle-fish; but\r\nthe latter lives a life which is, physiologically, higher than\r\nthe former, and its organisation is correspondingly increased\r\nin complexity.\r\n\r\nThis being understood, it may be repeated that, in the main,\r\nthe succession of life upon the globe in point of _time_ has\r\ncorresponded with the relative order of succession of the great\r\ngroups of animals in _zoological rank_; and some of the more\r\nstriking examples of this may be here alluded to. Amongst the\r\n_Echinoderms_, for instance, the two orders generally admitted to\r\nbe the \"lowest\" in the zoological scale--namely, the _Crinoids_\r\nand the _Cystoids_--are likewise the oldest, both, appearing in\r\nthe Cambrian, the former slowly dying out as we approach the\r\nRecent period, and the latter disappearing wholly before the\r\nclose of the Palæozoic period. Amongst the _Crustaceans_, the\r\nancient groups of the Trilobites, Ostracodes, Phyllopods,\r\nEurypterids, and Limuloids, some of which exist at the present\r\nday, are all \"low\" types; whereas the highly-organised Decapods\r\ndo not make their appearance till near the close of the Palæozoic\r\nepoch, and they do not become abundant till we reach Mesozoic\r\ntimes. Amongst the _Mollusca_, those Bivalves which possess\r\nbreathing-tubes (the \"siphonate\" Bivalves) are generally admitted\r\nto be higher than those which are destitute of these organs (the\r\n\"asiphonate\" Bivalves); and the latter are especially characteristic\r\nof the Palæozoic period, whilst the former abound in Mesozoic\r\nand Kainozoic formations. Similarly, the Univalves with\r\nbreathing-tubes and a corresponding notch in the mouth of the\r\nshell (\"siphonostomatous\" Univalves) are regarded as higher in\r\nthe scale than the round-mouthed vegetable-eating Sea-snails, in\r\nwhich no respiratory siphons exist (\"holostomatous\" Univalves);\r\nbut the latter abound in the Palæozoic rocks--whereas the former\r\ndo not make their appearance till the Jurassic period, and their\r\nhigher groups do not seem to have existed till the close of the\r\nCretaceous. The _Cephalopods_, again--the highest of all the groups\r\nof Mollusca--are represented in the Palæozoic rocks exclusively\r\nby Tetrabranchiate forms, which constitute the lowest of the\r\ntwo orders of this class; whereas the more highly specialised\r\nDibranchiates do not make their appearance till the commencement\r\nof the Mesozoic. The Palæozoic Tetrabranchiates, also, are of\r\na much simpler type than the highly complex _Ammonitidoe_ of\r\nthe Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts are observable amongst the _Vertebrate animals_.\r\nThe Fishes are the lowest class of Vertebrates, and they are\r\nthe first to appear, their first certain occurrence being in\r\nthe Upper Silurian; whilst, even if the Lower Silurian and Upper\r\nCambrian \"Conodonts\" were shown to be the teeth of Fishes, there\r\nwould still remain the enormously long periods of the Laurentian\r\nand Lower Cambrian, during which there were Invertebrates, but\r\nno Vertebrates. The _Amphibians_, the next class in zoological\r\norder, appears later than the Fishes, and is not represented till\r\nthe Carboniferous; whilst its highest group (that of the Frogs\r\nand Toads) does not make its entrance upon the scene till Tertiary\r\ntimes are reached. The class of the _Reptiles_, again, the next\r\nin order, does not appear till the Permian, and therefore not\r\ntill after Amphibians of very varied forms had been in existence\r\nfor a protracted period. The _Birds_ seem to be undoubtedly later\r\nthan the Reptiles; but, owing to the uncertainty as to the exact\r\npoint of their first appearance, it cannot be positively asserted\r\nthat they preceded Mammals, as they should have done. Finally,\r\nthe Mesozoic types of _Mammals_ are mainly, if not exclusively,\r\nreferable to the _Marsupials_, one of the lowest orders of the\r\nclass; whilst the higher orders of the \"Placental\" Quadrupeds\r\nare not with certainty known to have existed prior to the\r\ncommencement of the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nFacts of a very similar nature are offered by the succession\r\nof Plants upon the globe. Thus the vegetation of the Palæozoic\r\nperiod consisted principally of the lowly-organised groups of\r\nthe Cryptogamous or Flowerless plants. The Mesozoic formations,\r\nup to the Chalk, are especially characterised by the naked-seeded\r\nFlowering plants--the Conifers and the Cycads; whilst the higher\r\ngroups of the Angiospermous Exogens and Monocotyledons characterise\r\nthe Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks.\r\n\r\nFacts of the above nature--and they could be greatly multiplied--seem\r\nto point clearly to the existence of some law of progression,\r\nthough we certainly are not yet in a position to formulate this\r\nlaw, or to indicate the precise manner in which it has operated.\r\nTwo considerations, also, must not be overlooked. In the first\r\nplace, there are various groups, some of them highly organised,\r\nwhich make their appearance at an extremely ancient date, but\r\nwhich continue throughout geological time almost unchanged, and\r\ncertainly unprogressive. Many of these \"persistent types\" are\r\nknown--such as various of the _Foraminifera_, the _Linguloe_, the\r\n_Nautili_, &c.; and they indicate that under given conditions, at\r\npresent unknown to us, it is possible for a life-form to subsist\r\nfor an almost indefinite period without any important modification\r\nof its structure. In the second place, whilst the facts above\r\nmentioned point to some general law of progression of the great\r\nzoological groups, it cannot be asserted that the primeval types\r\n_of any given group_ are necessarily \"lower,\" zoologically speaking,\r\nthan their modern representatives. Nor does this seem to be at\r\nall necessary for the establishment of the law in question. It\r\ncannot be asserted, for example, that the Ganoid and Placoid Fishes\r\nof the Upper Silurian are in themselves less highly organised\r\nthan their existing representatives; nor can it even be asserted\r\nthat the Ganoid and Placoid orders are low _groups_ of the class\r\n_Pisces_. On the contrary, they are high groups; but then it\r\nmust be remembered that these are probably not really the first\r\nFishes, and that if we meet with Fishes at some future time in\r\nthe Lower Silurian or Cambrian, these may easily prove to be\r\nrepresentatives of the lower orders of the class. This question\r\ncannot be further entered into here, as its discussion could be\r\ncarried out to an almost unlimited length; but whilst there are\r\nfacts pointing both ways, it appears that at present we are not\r\njustified in asserting that the earlier types of each group--so far\r\nas these are known to us, or really are without predecessors--are\r\n_necessarily_ or _invariably_ more \"degraded\" or \"embryonic\" in\r\ntheir structure than their more modern representatives.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider very briefly how far Palæontology supports\r\nthe doctrine of \"Evolution,\" as it is called; and this, too, is a\r\nquestion of almost infinite dimensions, which can but be glanced at\r\nhere. Does Palæontology teach us that the almost innumerable kinds\r\nof animals and plants which we know to have successively flourished\r\nupon the earth in past times were produced separately and wholly\r\nindependently of each other, at successive periods? or does it\r\npoint to the theory that a large number of these supposed distinct\r\nforms, have been in reality produced by the slow modification of a\r\ncomparatively small number of primitive types? Upon the whole, it\r\nmust be unhesitatingly replied that the evidence of Palæontology\r\nis in favour of the view that the succession of life-forms upon\r\nthe globe has been to a large extent regulated by some orderly\r\nand constantly-acting law of modification and evolution. Upon\r\nno other theory can we comprehend how the fauna of any given\r\nformation is more closely related to that of the formation next\r\nbelow in the series, and to that of the formation next above,\r\nthan to that of any other series of deposits. Upon no other view\r\ncan we comprehend why the Post-Tertiary Mammals of South America\r\nshould consist principally of Edentates, Llamas, Tapirs, Peccaries,\r\nPlatyrhine Monkeys, and other forms now characterising this\r\ncontinent; whilst those of Australia should be wholly referable\r\nto the order of Marsupials. On no other view can we explain the\r\ncommon occurrence of \"intermediate\" or \"transitional\" forms of\r\nlife, filling in the gaps between groups now widely distinct.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are facts which point clearly to the\r\nexistence of some law other than that of evolution, and probably\r\nof a deeper and more far-reaching character. Upon no theory of\r\nevolution can we find a satisfactory explanation for the constant\r\nintroduction throughout geological time of new forms of life,\r\nwhich do not appear to have been preceded by pre-existent allied\r\ntypes; The Graptolites and Trilobites have no known predecessors,\r\nand leave no known successors. The Insects appear suddenly in the\r\nDevonian, and the Arachnides and Myriapods in the Carboniferous,\r\nunder well-differentiated and highly-specialised types. The\r\nDibranchiate Cephalopods appear with equal apparent suddenness in\r\nthe older Mesozoic deposits, and no known type of the Palæozoic\r\nperiod can be pointed to as a possible ancestor. The _Hippuritidoe_\r\nof the Cretaceous burst into a varied life to all appearance\r\nalmost immediately after their first introduction into existence.\r\nThe wonderful Dicotyledonous flora of the Upper Cretaceous period\r\nsimilarly surprises us without any prophetic annunciation from\r\nthe older Jurassic.\r\n\r\nMany other instances could be given; but enough has been said\r\nto show that there is a good deal to be said on both sides, and\r\nthat the problem is one environed with profound difficulties.\r\nOne point only seems now to be universally conceded, and that\r\nis, that the record of life in past time is not interrupted by\r\ngaps other than those due to the necessary imperfections of the\r\nfossiliferous series, to the fact that many animals are incapable\r\nof preservation in a fossil condition, or to other causes of a\r\nlike nature. All those who are entitled to speak on this head\r\nare agreed that the introduction of new and the destruction of\r\nold species have been slow and gradual processes, in no sense of\r\nthe term \"catastrophistic.\" Most are also willing to admit that\r\n\"Evolution\" has taken place in the past, to a greater or less\r\nextent, and that a greater or less number of so-called species of\r\nfossil animals are really the modified descendants of pre-existent\r\nforms. _How_ this process of evolution has been effected, to what\r\nextent it has taken place, under what conditions and laws it has\r\nbeen carried out, and how far it may be regarded as merely auxiliary\r\nand supplemental to some deeper law of change and progress, are\r\nquestions to which, in spite of the brilliant generalisations\r\nof Darwin, no satisfactory answer can as yet be given. In the\r\nsuccessful solution of this problem--if soluble with the materials\r\navailable to our hands--will lie the greatest triumph that\r\nPalæontology can hope to attain; and there is reason to think\r\nthat, thanks to the guiding-clue afforded by the genius of the\r\nauthor of the 'Origin of Species,' we are at least on the road\r\nto a sure, though it may be a far-distant, victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF THE CHIEF DIVISIONS OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n(Extinct groups are marked with an asterisk.
