  "content": "MUCK MAN\r\n\r\nBY FREMONT DODGE\r\n\r\nThe work wasn't hard, but there were some sacrifices.\r\nYou had to give up hope and freedom--and being human!\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\nWorlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963.\r\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\nthe U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the\r\nbailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as\r\nold Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done.\r\nShe didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a\r\ngirl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises.\r\nShe was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified\r\ncriminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if\r\nshe had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types,\r\nand not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\r\n\r\nTom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt\r\ncertain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for\r\nthe charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his\r\nlaboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of\r\nthe courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\r\n\r\nJumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back\r\nbehind bars.\r\n\r\n\"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\r\n\r\nAsa glared at him.\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the\r\nrap?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five or one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice\r\nair-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a\r\nlot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\r\n\r\nAsa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly\r\nwith his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\r\n\r\n\"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going\r\nto be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt\r\nSlider eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\r\n\r\nAsa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because\r\nhe had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The\r\nHazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years\r\nof so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's\r\nPlanet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched\r\nworld, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could\r\nduplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\r\n\r\nHis only problem would be staying alive for a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interview with a doctor from the Conversion Corps was required\r\nfor all persons who elected changeling status. The law stated that\r\npotential changelings must be fully informed of the rights and hazards\r\nof altered shape before they signed a release. The requirement held\r\nwhether or not the individual, like Asa, was already experienced.\r\n\r\nBy the time humanity traveled to the stars, medical biology had made\r\nit possible to regenerate damaged or deficient organs of the body.\r\nRegeneration was limited only by advanced age. Sometime after a man's\r\ntwo hundredth year his body lost the ability to be coaxed into growing\r\nnew cells. A fifth set of teeth was usually one's last. As long as\r\nsenescence could be staved off, however, any man could have bulging\r\nbiceps and a pencil waist, if he could pay for the treatment.\r\n\r\nUntil the medical associations declared such treatments unethical there\r\nwas even a short fad of deliberate deformities, with horns at the\r\ntemples particularly popular.\r\n\r\nFrom regeneration it was a short step to specialized regrowth. The\r\ntechniques were perfected to adapt humans to the dozen barely habitable\r\nworlds man had discovered. Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth\r\nin the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a\r\nman could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature\r\ncontrols than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets\r\na few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone\r\nwanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed\r\npermitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one\r\nyear as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had\r\nto spend in rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n\"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\"\r\nAsa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he\r\nasked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions.\r\n\r\n\"Four,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Squiffs for New Arcady. Adapted for climbing the skycraper trees and\r\nwith the arm structure modified into pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we\r\nneed spiderinos for Von Neumann Two. If you want the nearest thing we\r\nhave to Earth, there's Caesar's Moon, where we'd just have to double\r\nyour tolerance for carbon monoxide and make you a bigger and better\r\ngorilla than the natives. Last, of course, there's always a need for\r\nmuck men on Jordan's Planet.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to\r\nchoose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\n\"What's the pay range?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von\r\nNeumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\"\r\n\r\nAsa raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the\r\nmud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the\r\nchangeling comfortable in his new environment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure they do,\" said the doctor. \"We can make you think mud feels\r\nbetter than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a\r\ngrasshopper despite the double gravity. But we can't make you like the\r\nsight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" Asa mused aloud, \"it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the\r\nend of the year.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward to fill in the necessary form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special\r\nenvironments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion\r\nchambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa\r\nGraybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard\r\nto bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\r\n\r\nSometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once\r\none of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on\r\nspaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he\r\ndecided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all\r\nhe learned about space travel.\r\n\r\nNevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or\r\ncellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More\r\nimportant, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and\r\nhad wanted to return.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The\r\nones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun\r\nto die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to\r\ngo crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine\r\nthousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that\r\nflashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\r\n\r\nAsa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could\r\nunderstand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while\r\nthe albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic\r\nfilaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played\r\ntiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life.\r\nElectrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but\r\nthe phenomenon remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nHardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to\r\nquestion its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only\r\nrandom, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of\r\nlight, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\r\n\r\nIt took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and\r\nfading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had\r\never seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have\r\nmade him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\r\n\r\n\"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are\r\nthe egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when\r\nyou scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes\r\nswooping out of nowhere at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the\r\nSliders?\"\r\n\r\nKershaw grinned.\r\n\r\n\"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping\r\nfor home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand.\r\nWhen the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in\r\nthe mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back\r\nand hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter\r\ncomes--and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake--you live to\r\ntell the tale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAsa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to\r\nlearn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another\r\nphysical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was\r\npounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the\r\ndoctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\r\n\r\n\"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\r\n\r\nAsa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning\r\nto lose consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\r\n\r\nHe felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before\r\nconsciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance\r\nto back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the\r\nconversion tank right now.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for\r\na long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nEveryone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one\r\nstand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that\r\nhis head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his\r\nlower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward\r\nso that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around\r\nas an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with\r\nbroad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like\r\nclaws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of\r\nhair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\r\n\r\nThis, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong\r\ntraces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly\r\nemerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under\r\nthose horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could\r\nstill weep.\r\n\r\nHe started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only\r\ntry hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\r\n\r\nAsa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve\r\nand muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high\r\nas Kershaw's head.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll\r\ngo outside.\"\r\n\r\nAsa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of\r\nfabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as\r\nKershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room\r\nwhere they had been left to revive from conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from\r\nthe Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard\r\nwas open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky\r\nof Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud\r\nflats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged\r\nalong the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\r\n\r\nFrom fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them\r\nin two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were\r\na gun and a long knife.\r\n\r\n\"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big\r\neverywhere in proportion.\r\n\r\n\"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Graybar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on,\r\nyou.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty\r\nand warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\r\n\r\nAsa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his\r\ndistorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown\r\nhow to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim\r\nrockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a\r\nnative vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\r\n\r\nFurston laughed.\r\n\r\n\"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\r\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any\r\nideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is\r\nwhere you eat.\"\r\n\r\nAsa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He\r\nlifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from\r\nan observation tower on the roof.\r\n\r\nHe leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\r\n\r\nGazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session\r\nwith Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\r\n\r\nThe girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried\r\nhim. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent\r\nposition to make the riddance permanent.\r\n\r\nAt supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with\r\nthe dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the\r\ntwo were doing out here.\r\n\r\n\"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of\r\nthe others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel\r\nhe is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNext morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to\r\ncarry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and\r\nassigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called\r\nGraybar aside.\r\n\r\n\"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week\r\nknocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there\r\nand work that muck.\"\r\n\r\nFurston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could\r\nshow Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the\r\ncourtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it\r\nand hopped along after Kershaw.\r\n\r\nFeet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the\r\nHazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The\r\nmud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was\r\nnot at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins\r\nlike a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded\r\nand splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced\r\neye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here\r\nlately. If you see something like an express train headed our way,\r\nstart shooting.\"\r\n\r\nAt each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no\r\nSliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as\r\nmuch as on top of it.\r\n\r\nKershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten\r\nyards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in\r\nthe muck.\r\n\r\n\"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg\r\nwas laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to\r\nspot when the new weeds start growing.\"\r\n\r\nKershaw took a long look around.\r\n\r\n\"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\r\n\r\nThey started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs\r\nof mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually\r\na muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw\r\ndug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had\r\nto dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit\r\nbig enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently\r\nbefore it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he\r\nworked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything\r\nabout the operation was wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping\r\nslime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of\r\nmud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look\r\nat it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds\r\nbeing splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's\r\nearphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the\r\nscintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider\r\nfor help. Asa looked around.\r\n\r\n\"Jump!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black\r\nscales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the\r\nweeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row\r\nupon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered\r\nits head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nAsa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing.\r\nWhile he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio\r\ndown from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned\r\ninstantly, his gun in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw\r\nand Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the way.\"\r\n\r\nAsa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by\r\nthe Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the\r\nother had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where\r\nKershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working\r\nmadly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The\r\nrocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray\r\nflesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward\r\nAsa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw\r\nthe Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs\r\nwere tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the\r\nSlider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he\r\nthrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nEven as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered\r\nwith shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion.\r\nDesperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body\r\nshiver and lie still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsa took a deep breath and looked around.\r\n\r\n\"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again.\r\nAsa leaped over to him.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good\r\none. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\r\n\r\n\"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over\r\nat the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on\r\ngetting killed doing this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six\r\neggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring\r\nthe eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\r\n\r\nAsa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance\r\nwhere it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried\r\nthe egg.\r\n\r\n\"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\r\n'copter, late as usual.\"\r\n\r\nThe big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and\r\nsettled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see\r\nTom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open\r\nand leaned out.\r\n\r\n\"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll\r\nget the egg.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the\r\nhelicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the\r\nwaist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was.\r\nKershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred\r\npounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\r\n\r\nDorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's\r\nshoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the\r\ncabin was crowded.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\r\n\r\nAsa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\r\n\r\n\"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\r\n\r\n\"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to\r\nHarriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might\r\nask him to tell you about it.\"\r\n\r\nDorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that\r\nworried Asa.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In\r\nanother minute the helicopter was in the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty\r\nminutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return\r\nfor the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg\r\napproximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the\r\negg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\r\n\r\nAsa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\r\n\r\n\"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you\r\ncoming?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\r\n\r\nIf he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him\r\nall along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an\r\negg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he\r\nwould be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from\r\nwhich he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip.\r\nThere were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his\r\nway. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they\r\nlost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\r\n\r\nWhat was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at\r\nnight. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in\r\nthis strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\r\n\r\nA whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SLIDER EGG]\r\n\r\nThen he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed\r\nhelicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming\r\nback alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the\r\ncarcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\r\n\r\nNo machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big\r\nmachine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to\r\nhover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside,\r\nthe landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter\r\nflipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into\r\nthe mud.\r\n\r\nAsa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe\r\npassage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the\r\nextra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose\r\nof the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the\r\ncontrols to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady\r\nherself as she climbed out of the machine.\r\n\r\n\"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun.\r\nFrom the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of\r\nthe settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone\r\nwho talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\r\n\r\n\"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\r\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\r\n\r\nAsa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He\r\neyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort\r\nit would make.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here\r\nand we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me\r\nto Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was\r\nhere was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and\r\nthere seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run\r\nthings to suit myself and he walked off.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\r\n\r\n\"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could\r\nhardly believe it yet.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used\r\nto this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up\r\nstraight?\"\r\n\r\nAsa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of\r\nthe plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in\r\nthe mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held\r\nit with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\r\n\r\n\"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if\r\nthat problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle\r\nthe machine-gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before\r\nwe could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought\r\nwhile she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men\r\nwho went out today?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of\r\nthem may not have got back yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsa started talking into his radio.\r\n\r\n\"Calling all muck men. This is Asa Graybar. All muck men, listen. This\r\nis Graybar. I am five miles out with Miss Hazeltyne, who came to rescue\r\nme after I saved Kershaw from a Slider. The helicopter is smashed.\r\nWe're slogging in.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a nod of confirmation and repeated the message.\r\n\r\n\"Graybar?\" came a voice in his earphones. \"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nAsa grinned at Harriet as he continued.\r\n\r\n\"Go on back to the settlement. Tell the others. Then organize a party\r\nto come help us. Bearing 150 degrees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said the unidentified voice.\r\n\r\n\"I got it too,\" said another voice in the headset. \"Muck men stick\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nGood, Asa thought. At least two muckers were still out. They would\r\ntell the others.\r\n\r\n\"Cancel all that,\" said a third voice. \"This is Dorr speaking. Nobody\r\ngoes out until I give the word.\"\r\n\r\nAsa didn't fancy waiting.\r\n\r\n\"By authority of Miss Hazeltyne,\" he said rapidly, \"Dorr is no longer\r\nmanager. I am acting manager.\" He saw Harriet's eyebrows go up, for she\r\ncouldn't hear the other end of what was going on. \"Disregard Dorr,\"\r\nhe continued. \"If you can help us get back, Miss Hazeltyne will make\r\nchanges to benefit all of us.\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could say any more his ear was stricken with the noise of\r\nloud static. Dorr was making sure no more radio messages got through.\r\nAsa quickly told Harriet what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe girl smiled with one side of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" she said, \"but how am I supposed to cross the muck?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my back,\" Asa turned and entered the helicopter cabin. All the time\r\nhe had been talking he had been worrying about the fact that he had\r\nonly three rockets left for his gun. Quickly he checked the ammunition\r\nfor the machine-gun, found it was the same caliber, and felt that at\r\nlast one break had gone his way. He took the plastic ammunition belts\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"Load your pockets with these,\" he told the girl, pulling the rockets\r\nfrom their loops. Then, tying the plastic belts together, he fashioned\r\na sling she could sit in with her legs at his sides. Finally he handed\r\nher his gun.\r\n\r\n\"If you see a Slider,\" he said, \"shoot for the head. Now climb on and\r\nhold tight to my gun harness and we'll try our luck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she was astride his back Asa checked his compass and started\r\njumping. At once he knew that the going would be much harder than he\r\nhad imagined. Alone he could leap twenty-five yards, but her weight cut\r\nhim down to about five yards. He kept going, realizing that the task\r\nwas almost beyond his strength and not daring to tell her that even if\r\nhis strength held out they might not even find the settlement in this\r\ndrizzle.\r\n\r\nHopping, sometimes staggering, skirting the wider pools in the swamp.\r\nAsa managed to go about a mile before he had to stop and rest. Harriet\r\nclimbed out of the sling and settled down on a patch of weeds, a wet\r\nand slippery mat upon the mud.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to make it,\" she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" he said. \"Not just for ourselves. A lot of changes should\r\nbe made. There must be millions of eggs on this planet. You're getting\r\nonly a couple hundred a year.\"\r\n\r\nHe was panting between sentences and stopped talking until he could\r\ncatch his breath.\r\n\r\n\"For one thing,\" he continued, \"rockets are the wrong weapon against\r\nthe Sliders. Flame throwers would be better. Of course they're a\r\nlot heavier than guns. But everything about the way you go after\r\neggs is wrong. It's criminal to send one man out alone. It's utterly\r\nirresponsible to have only one helicopter. You're putting a price on\r\neggs in terms of human lives. Muck men are human, you know, no matter\r\nwhat we look like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very human,\" she said softly, \"and very brave.\"\r\n\r\nHe returned her smile, adding, \"And we'll both be very dead unless we\r\nget going.\"\r\n\r\nThey had traveled considerably less than a mile when he had to stop\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"How would you run things here?\" Harriet asked.\r\n\r\n\"Start with new premises. There's no need to make monsters out of the\r\nmuck men. Double their strength, and perhaps give them web feet, but\r\nwhy legs like a frog? If I could walk normally I could be pulling you\r\non a sled. And why shovel hands instead of proper tools? Of course you\r\nwould still have to give them a skin for this weather.\"\r\n\r\nHarriet's clothing was sodden and streaked with mud, and her hair\r\nwas hanging down her head in wet, dark tangles that looked like so\r\nmuch boiled spinach. The bump when the helicopter fell had raised a\r\nblue-black swelling around her left eye. Yet, it occurred to Asa, she\r\nhadn't voiced the slightest complaint. She was listening intently to\r\nhis advice.\r\n\r\n\"I would send parties of three men out in a helicopter,\" he continued.\r\n\"One would guard the ship while the other two hunted eggs. As soon as\r\nthey found an egg they'd hop into the ship and be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey started off again. At the first leap Asa saw a Slider a hundred\r\nyards away. As soon as his feet hit the ground he whispered to Harriet.\r\nShe climbed out of the sling and held her gun ready while he drew his\r\nknife to wait. Long minutes passed before he decided they had not been\r\nseen and it was safe to continue.\r\n\r\nNext time they stopped the girl turned to Asa with a frown and asked,\r\n\"Just how does Dorr think he can get away with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Simple.\" Asa shrugged. \"He'll say the Sliders got us despite all he\r\ncould do. No muck man who could tell a different story will live long\r\nenough to get back to Earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of a rocket explosion came from somewhere off to their right.\r\nIt was the loveliest sound Asa had ever heard.\r\n\r\n\"The rescue party!\" he shouted. \"Let's go!\"\r\n\r\nKnowing that rockets meant Sliders, but knowing also that no Slider was\r\na match for a team of armed men, Asa leaped forward with renewed vigor.\r\nOnce he misjudged his strength and landed in a puddle, splashing both\r\nof them with slimy water, but the girl on his back only laughed. They\r\nheard the sound of another rocket, and Harriet fired three shots of\r\nher own to attract attention. In a few more minutes they were happily\r\nwelcoming six muck men.\r\n\r\n\"I heard your message,\" said one of them, \"and back at the settlement\r\nKershaw told us what had happened. Furston tried to stop us and wound\r\nup with a knife in his belly. A couple of the others were afraid to\r\ncome, and two were shot from the tower by Dorr, but the rest are with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Dorr will be tried for murder,\" Harriet promised grimly.\r\n\r\nWith different men taking turns carrying Harriet for short distances\r\nthey began to make progress rapidly. The Slider the men had been firing\r\nat was dead and no more were sighted before they came to the settlement.\r\n\r\nDorr was waiting for them. He fired from the tower, his machine-gun\r\nburst of rockets cutting through one man in mid-leap. Asa's party\r\nhugged the mud and fired back. Plastic showered from the tower window,\r\nand dust spurted from the concrete around it.\r\n\r\n\"Keep me covered,\" Asa shouted. He took the gun from Harriet and leaped\r\nmadly forward until he was under the shelter of the side of the dome.\r\nHe waited for one more salvo from his party and jumped to the tower\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nDorr had vanished, driven out of the tower by the rockets. Asa waved\r\nto the others to come forward and hopped into the main quarters of the\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nHe had never been in this part of the settlement. Dorr could be lying\r\nin ambush for him. Asa moved cautiously, but he was confident that\r\nhis own adjustment to the gravity of the planet would give him the\r\nadvantage in any sudden meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe looked around the corner and down some stairs just in time to see\r\nthe discredited manager, holding a sack in one hands, struggle to open\r\na door. Asa fired and missed. The next moment Dorr was outside. Asa\r\nleaped to the floor below.\r\n\r\nOne of the normal humans who lived in the settlement came out of\r\nanother room, saw Asa and dodged back out of sight.\r\n\r\nOutside, Asa could see Dorr laboring to run along the paved road that\r\nled to the spaceship a quarter of a mile away. The fugitive turned once\r\nand fired wildly as Asa leaped after him. The mist was turning into\r\nheavy rain, and it was getting harder to see.\r\n\r\nAnother rocket exploded somewhere out in front of Asa. The sound was\r\nfollowed by a scream. One more leap and Asa began firing himself.\r\n\r\nA Slider was gently taking into its mouth three eggs spilled from the\r\nsack lying beside what was left of Tom Dorr.\r\n\r\nOne of Asa's shots destroyed the Slider, destroying the eggs, too as\r\nthe monster's head exploded. Asa didn't think the eggs mattered much\r\nright now.\r\n\r\nHe shuffled slowly back to the settlement, deciding to accept when\r\nHarriet offered him the managership. Some day, if he had his way,\r\nSlider eggs would be as common on Earth as diamonds.",
