This is because of\r\nits resources, its climate, and its accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe country is easily reached from all directions through its seaports\r\non both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and through its rapidly growing\r\nsystem of railways. From California, from the neighboring ports of other\r\nCentral American countries and from Panama there is regular and reliable\r\nsteamship service on the Pacific coast. On the Atlantic or Gulf side\r\nfrom New York, New Orleans, Galveston and Mobile there is frequent\r\nsteamship service, while there is also connection at Colon with English\r\nand German lines. The steamers on the Pacific coast connect at San Jose\r\nwith the Guatemala Central Railway, which affords easy means of arriving\r\nat the capital city and the great coffee-raising districts. These are\r\nreached by the branch to Mazatenango, which forms a junction with the\r\nOccidental Railway between Champerico and San Felipe. On the Atlantic\r\nside is Puerto Barrios, which will derive additional importance from the\r\nearly completion of the Northern Railway and which will place New\r\nOrleans within five days or less of Guatemala City, Chicago six days,\r\nand New York seven days. Besides the means of communication afforded\r\njointly by the steamship lines and the railroads at an early date there\r\nwill be complete and uninterrupted railway communication with St. Louis\r\nand other points of the Mississippi Valley through Mexico. The means of\r\ncommunication and transportation are given more fully later on.\r\n\r\nGeographically the Republic of Guatemala is the heart of intertropical\r\nAmerica. It is the most northern part of Central America, in shape like\r\na polygon, with the southern side the longest. It lies approximately\r\nbetween north latitude 13 deg. and 42' and 17 deg. and 49', and between 88 deg. and\r\n10' and 92 deg. and 30' longitude west of Greenwich. Its area is 50,600\r\nsquare miles--the greatest length from north to south being 360 and from\r\neast to west 390 miles. The Pacific coast line with indentations is\r\nnearly 400 miles and the Atlantic line about 150 miles in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIKING PHYSICAL ASPECTS.\r\n\r\nIn its physical aspects Guatemala is a country of mountains, tropical\r\nforests, lakes and rivers and coast plains. It was described by Humboldt\r\nmore than one hundred years ago as extremely fertile and well\r\ncultivated, and this description holds good to-day, though there are\r\nvast areas of rich agricultural land yet open to profitable cultivation\r\nand only awaiting immigration to develop their richness.\r\n\r\nThe Guatemalan Andes consist of three minor mountain systems. These are\r\nthe northern zone, chiefly of denuded cones, 1,500 to 2,000 feet in\r\nheight, with plains lying between them; the central zone consisting of\r\nranges and chains running east and west with many marked elevations\r\nrising from 7,000 to 14,000 feet; and the southern zone consisting of\r\neruptive chains which culminate in many notable volcanic peaks, some of\r\nwhich are more than 14,000 feet in height. These are known as the\r\nCordilleras and they parallel the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThere are three river systems emptying respectively into the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the Atlantic and the Pacific. Some of the streams flowing into\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico are navigable by steamboats of light draught.\r\n\r\nOf the Atlantic tributaries the principal rivers are the Sarstoon, the\r\nMotagua and the Dulce; the latter empties into the Gulf of Honduras.\r\nNavigation is possible on the Motagua for about 75 miles from the mouth.\r\nThe rivers flowing into the Pacific include the Paz, the Suchiate, and\r\nthe Patulul. These have their sources in the Andean Cordilleras or the\r\nneighboring highlands. There is also the Michatoya which is navigable\r\nfor small boats to its confluence with the Maria Linda. Generally\r\nspeaking, a few of the rivers on the southern coast might be made\r\nnavigable for short distances with boats of very light draught.\r\n\r\nGuatemala has a series of inland lakes which include Izabal, Atitlan,\r\nAmatitlan, which are capable of steam navigation; Peten, Ayarza and\r\nGuija. The largest of these is Lake Izabal, which is 58 miles long by 12\r\nmiles in width and which has its outlet through the Dulce River into the\r\nGulf of Honduras.\r\n\r\nThe cities and municipal districts having a population of 10,000 and\r\nupwards are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     NAME.              POPULATION.\r\n     Guatemala City         100,000\r\n     Antigua                 10,000\r\n     Quezaltenango           25,000\r\n     Totonicapan             33,000\r\n     Coban                   23,000\r\n     Chiquimula              13,000\r\n     Jalapa                  13,000\r\n     Escuintla               13,000\r\n     Salama                  13,000\r\n     Amatitlan               10,000\r\n     Zacapa                  12,000\r\n     Flores                  13,000\r\n     Jutiapa                 14,000\r\n     Huehuetenango           10,000\r\n     Retalhuleu              10,000\r\n     Solola                  15,000\r\n     Mazatenango             10,000\r\n     San Marcos              10,000\r\n     Atitlan                 10,000\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANDSOME CAPITAL CITY.\r\n\r\nGuatemala, the capital, is the largest city in Central America. The\r\nlocation is unusually healthy, being 5,000 feet above sea level. The\r\ncity is laid out on a splendid scale with many fine avenues and parks.\r\nIt is improving its system of tramways by changing to electricity as\r\nthe motor power. The public buildings are especially notable. Among the\r\nprincipal ones are the Palaces of the Government, the Presidency, the\r\nLegislative Power, the Judicial Power, the Municipality, and the\r\nArchbishopric; the Cathedral and other magnificent churches; the\r\nMinistry of Public Improvement (Fomento), the Mint, the Conservatory of\r\nMusic, the general offices of accounts, of police, and of liquors and\r\ninternal revenue; the custom-house, the national institutes of young\r\nmen, of young ladies and of the native race, the first of which is\r\nprovided with a meteorological observatory; the schools of law,\r\nmedicine, engineering, polytechny, and arts; the children's college and\r\na large number of public schools; the Colon theatre; the registry of\r\nreal estate, the national printing-office, the post-office, the National\r\nMuseum; the military hospital, and the general hospitals, the asylums\r\nfor the insane and for convalescents and invalids; the central and the\r\nCalvary markets; the penitentiary and the artillery, cavalry, and Guard\r\nof Honor and San Francisco barracks; San Jose and Matamoros forts, and a\r\nvery large number of other imposing edifices. The American Club, which\r\nhas several hundred members, mostly citizens of the United States,\r\noccupies fine quarters.\r\n\r\nSome of the parks, plazas, and public drives are adorned with very\r\nbeautiful marble or bronze statues. Among the principal ones are the\r\nbronze monument of Christopher Columbus in the central park and the\r\nmarble one of the same historic personage in the garden of the Colon\r\nTheatre; that of General J. Rufino Barrios and that of Don Miguel Garcia\r\nGranados in the boulevard of the Reforma; and that of Friar Bartolomew\r\nde Las Casas in the campus of the Institute of the Indian race. The last\r\nthree statues are of bronze.\r\n\r\nThe seaports of Guatemala are of a varied character. Their value grows\r\nevery day because of the increased commerce that is resulting from the\r\ndevelopment of the country under the industrial policies of President\r\nEstrada Cabrera. On the Atlantic the leading ports are Livingston,\r\nIzabal, Santo Tomas, and Puerto Barrios. Of these Puerto Barrios is\r\neasily first. It lies at the extremity of the Gulf of Amatique, is\r\nspacious and is well protected against winds. As the terminus of the\r\nGuatemalan Northern Railway it is assured of a very extensive trade both\r\nin exports and in imports. Puerto Barrios is not only a receiving and\r\ndistributing center for Guatemala, but also for a considerable portion\r\nof the neighboring Republic of Salvador, which has no port on the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nThe chief ports on the Pacific side are San Jose, Champerico, and Ocos.\r\nBy far the largest amount of business is done through the port of San\r\nJose, which is the terminus of the Guatemalan Central Railroad. It has\r\nextensive quays and other facilities for navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.\r\n\r\nGuatemala is well supplied with ocean transportation facilities, several\r\nof the steamship companies receiving aid from the government. On the\r\nPacific coast there is the Pacific Mail which maintains a regular\r\nfortnightly service with extra vessels during the coffee season and\r\nwhich touches at the ports between San Francisco and Panama. The German\r\nline known as the Kosmos puts the Guatemalan ports in communication with\r\nthe West Coast of South America as well as with the ports of California\r\nand Mexico. It carries both passengers and freight. There are also\r\nnumerous small coasting vessels. It is probable that service will be\r\nresumed by the various Chilean lines which formerly proceeded to San\r\nFrancisco, touching at Guatemalan and other ports, but which of recent\r\nyears have not gone north of Panama. All the vessels have excellent\r\npassenger accommodations.\r\n\r\nFrom the Atlantic ports there are ships engaged in the fruit trade with\r\nNew York and Boston, some of which carry passengers. Usually, however,\r\npassengers prefer to travel by way of New Orleans or Mobile, from either\r\nof which cities every Thursday there is a vessel plying directly to\r\nPuerto Barrios. The most complete service is that maintained by the\r\nUnited Fruit Company.\r\n\r\nIn view of the growing development on the Atlantic slope and of the\r\ncommerce which is certain to result there is an excellent opportunity\r\nfor an increased steamship service with the ports of the United States.\r\nThe time could be greatly lessened with advantages both in the\r\ntransportation of freight and in the benefit to passengers. The policy\r\nof the government towards steamship lines both as relates to port\r\ncharges and to other measures is a most liberal one and every inducement\r\nis offered to engage in furnishing additional facilities, which will\r\nshorten the time between the different points and increase the frequency\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF RAILROAD SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe railway system of Guatemala under the administration of President\r\nEstrada Cabrera is certain to be the most useful means of developing the\r\ncountry. Every encouragement is given to capital to engage in railroad\r\nenterprises. The general plan includes both an interoceanic railroad and\r\nlinks in the intercontinental or north and south lines. No measure of\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera's administration has been of greater\r\nimportance than his action in securing the completion of the Northern\r\nRailway, which will be open for traffic throughout its entire length by\r\nthe end of 1906. This places the capital and the whole interior of the\r\ncountry in direct communication with Puerto Barrios and insures a very\r\nheavy decrease in the cost of freight both for the agricultural exports\r\nand for the merchandise and other imports. The line runs from Guatemala\r\nCity to El Rancho and thence to Puerto Barrios. At various times\r\nconcessions were given for building the different sections, but\r\ncircumstances caused many of them to be almost abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn the face of repeated discouragements President Estrada Cabrera took\r\nup the subject with resolute spirit and with the sanction of the\r\nNational Assembly made a contract with a syndicate of which the\r\nprincipals were Sir William C. Van Horne, the celebrated railroad man,\r\nwho completed the Canadian Pacific Railway in the face of monumental\r\ndifficulties and who subsequently built the Cuba Central Railway; and\r\nMinor C. Keith, of the United Fruit Company, who for a third of a\r\ncentury had been identified with various successful enterprises in\r\nCentral America. Subsequently the Guatemala Central Railway took a share\r\nin the enterprise and also German banking and coffee interests. Under\r\nthe contract no export duty is to be laid on agricultural exports\r\ntransported over the railroad except coffee and the Company is given the\r\nright to fix its passenger and freight charges on a gold basis. There\r\nwere many engineering difficulties to be overcome, the chiefest of which\r\nwas the bridging of the Motagua River. The material for this railway\r\nconstruction was imported principally from the United States, the rails\r\nfrom Maryland and the bridgework across the Motagua and other rivers\r\nfrom Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this Northern Railway to the development of Guatemala\r\nis incalculable. It insures the opening up of a very rich country which\r\nmeans a great addition to the exports of Guatemala and it also should\r\nbring a large immigration because of the facilities for easy\r\ncommunication and access to the markets of the United States which it\r\nwill afford. With the operation of the Northern Railway in connection\r\nwith the Guatemala Central, the country will have a through railway line\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, 270 miles in length. While the\r\ninterior development is the chief benefit of this through railway\r\nsystem, it is not unlikely that during the years that must pass until\r\nthe Panama Canal is completed some of the international traffic which\r\ncannot be accommodated on the railway line across the Isthmus will find\r\na cheap and expeditious passage across Guatemala.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific slope the leading railway system is the Guatemala\r\nCentral. It was built by C. P. Huntington and is one of the best\r\nrailroads anywhere south of the Rio Grande. Though of narrow gauge the\r\nroadbed was laid for standard gauge, and this change can be made at any\r\ntime. Unlike most foreign railways the Guatemala Central maintains the\r\nAmerican system of checking baggage. Its main line and branches cover\r\nthe coffee-raising districts of the Pacific coast section of Guatemala.\r\nThe Occidental Railroad has about 50 miles of track and the Ocos line 20\r\nmiles. Both of these are on the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPREHENSIVE RAILWAY POLICY.\r\n\r\nIt is worth knowing that while the interoceanic line approaches\r\ncompletion Guatemala is making decided progress in the links of the\r\nPan-American or intercontinental north and south trunk line. From a\r\njunction with the Northern a branch will run south to Zacapa and\r\nultimately will be extended into Salvador. Towards the north there is\r\nonly a section of 30 miles to be completed in order to prolong the\r\nGuatemalan system to Ayutla on the border of Mexico and this will be\r\ndone as soon as the extension of the Mexican lines to the boundary are\r\ncompleted. These extensions are to be finished within two years, so it\r\nmay reasonably be said that by the end of 1907, if not sooner, a through\r\nrailway journey will be possible from San Francisco, Chicago, or New\r\nYork to the capital of Guatemala. The importance of this railway\r\nbuilding was shown by Senator Stephen B. Elkins, the chairman of the\r\nSenate Committee on Interstate Commerce, in a speech made at the dinner\r\ngiven the Pan-American Railway Committee by the Hon. H. G. Davis. In his\r\nspeech Senator Elkins said that the freight on coffee, which now\r\napproximates $20 per ton or $1,000 on a carload of 50 tons, would be\r\ncheapened till it came down to $250 per carload, or $5 per ton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO COLUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nThe railroad laws of Guatemala are thus explained in my official report\r\nas Commissioner of the Pan-American Railway:\r\n\r\n\"The railways of Guatemala are regulated by the provisions of the\r\nCommercial Code and by the general railway law known as Decree No. 566,\r\ndated February 1, 1898. By the terms of this decree persons or companies\r\nseeking franchises are required to submit the plans to the Department of\r\nFomento; when indorsed by that Department the sanction of the Council of\r\nState is sought, and finally the approval of the National Legislature.\r\nAll contracts celebrated by the executive power have to be approved by\r\nthe National Legislature. The contracts may be with designated\r\nindividuals, with persons acting for others, or for companies that are\r\nto be formed.\r\n\r\n\"Concessions can be granted with subsidy or without it, guaranteeing or\r\nnot the capital which may be invested, with an interest proportionate to\r\nthe product. The Government shall include in the estimates the share of\r\npecuniary responsibilities required for fulfilling the obligation\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\n\"The State may exempt the enterprise from the payment of every class of\r\ncontributions, from the use of stamped paper and fiscal dues, for the\r\ntime which it may consider just or opportune, but in every instance the\r\nexemptions shall be specified in the contract.\r\n\r\n\"The right of eminent domain or expropriation for the benefit of\r\ngrantees holding franchises is enforced. The Government also undertakes\r\nto procure uniformity in the gauge and the rails.\r\n\r\n\"The Government offers every inducement to promote the extension and\r\ndevelopment of railroads in the country. The best evidence of its policy\r\ntoward legitimate and genuine capital is shown in the terms of the\r\ncontract for the completion of the Northern Railroad.\r\n\r\n\"The engineering difficulties of railroad construction in Guatemala are\r\nnot grave, as the lines skirt the foothills of the great agricultural\r\nregions. The immense natural resources, consisting of the products both\r\nof the tropical and the temperate climates, such as coffee, sugar,\r\ntobacco, the cereals; the vast pasturage for live stock; the undeveloped\r\ntimber industries, and the unexploited mines, all open up prospects for\r\nprofitable traffic.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to its railways Guatemala seeks to maintain a complete\r\nsystem of highways or cart roads. Among the most important cart roads\r\nwhich have recently been built or are now under construction, are those\r\nfrom the capital to San Juan Sacatepequez, San Pedro and San Raymundo.\r\nThere is also a cart road between Huehuetenango and Quezaltenango; one\r\nfrom Coban to Quiche which will join the departments of the north with\r\nthe rich western section of the Republic; from Totonicapan to Quiche;\r\nthat between Ovejero and Trujillo, which will place in communication the\r\ndepartments of Jutiapa and Jalapa; that from Tumbador to San Marcos;\r\nthat from Solola to Panajachel; that from Chicacao to Nahualate; and\r\nfinally the highway from San Jeronimo and Rancho San Augustin, which\r\nwill join the department of Baja Verapaz with Zacapa. All these roads\r\nserve as new arteries for the development and the enlargement of\r\ncommerce and agriculture and this has been the special care of President\r\nEstrada Cabrera, who has provided the means for opening, wherever\r\npossible, the necessary ways of communication.\r\n\r\nDistances between the capital city and the principal points of the\r\ncountry are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     GUATEMALA TO               MILES.\r\n     Antigua                        27\r\n     Chimaltenango                  36\r\n     Amatitlan                      18\r\n     Escuintla                      431/2\r\n     Cuajiniquilapa                 42\r\n     Solola                         90\r\n     Totonicapan                   111\r\n     Quezaltenango                 120\r\n     Mazatenango                   138\r\n     Retalhuleu                    153\r\n     San Marcos                    165\r\n     Huehuetenango                 195\r\n     Santa Cruz de Quiche           96\r\n     Salama                         69\r\n     Coban                         126\r\n     Flores                        321\r\n     Izabal                        216\r\n     Zacapa                        126\r\n     Chiquimula                    135\r\n     Jalapa                         75\r\n     Jutiapa                        87\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTAL AND CABLE SERVICE.\r\n\r\nThe means of facilitating intercourse both among its own people and with\r\nthe outside world has always been encouraged by the government of\r\nGuatemala.\r\n\r\nThe Republic is a member of the International Postal Union. It has an\r\nexcellent post-office service, both foreign and domestic. Complete\r\ninformation is given in the Postal Code of the Republic. During the last\r\nyear the number of pieces of mail received in all the offices of the\r\nRepublic was nearly 5,000,000, while the mail matter transmitted\r\namounted to 3,653,000 separate pieces. The telegraph and telephone are\r\nnationalized and are controlled and operated by the Government, though\r\nthere are also some private telephone lines in the capital. The national\r\ntelegraph lines have a total length of about 5,300 kilometers, 3,290\r\nmiles, and the telephone lines of 500 kilometers, 310 miles. The number\r\nof telegrams transmitted in a given year was 1,106,832. The Government\r\nis constantly constructing new lines both for telegraph and telephone\r\nservice. At the present time there are nearly 200 telegraph offices and\r\nabout 100 telephone offices. The rates both for telegraph and telephone\r\nmessages, which are payable in Guatemalan currency, are quite moderate.\r\nA telegram of 10 words to any part of the Republic costs about 5 cents\r\nin gold. The long distance telephone service is at the rate of about 15\r\ncents for a five minutes' conversation.\r\n\r\nThe cable service is maintained by the Central and South American\r\nTelegraph Company, whose main office is at San Jose. The following are\r\nthe charges per word in gold:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Guatemala to points in the United States     55 cts.\r\n         \"           \"      \"   Great Britain     80 cts.\r\n         \"           \"      \"   France            80 cts.\r\n         \"           \"      \"   Germany           80 cts.\r\n         \"           \"      \"   Canada            58 cts.\r\n         \"           \"      \"   Central America   29 to 32 cts.\r\n         \"        Havana, Cuba                    66 cts.\r\n         \"        points in Mexico                31 to 44 cts.\r\n         \"        City of Panama                  37 cts.\r\n         \"        City of Colon                   47 cts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLICIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuatemala in order to fulfil its destiny as the country of the future\r\nmust be assured of stable and progressive government hospitable to\r\nforeign capital. To insure these things it is necessary to have the\r\nright man at the head of affairs. No one now questions that Guatemala\r\npossesses this advantage in the person of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, whose\r\nterm as President will not expire till 1911.\r\n\r\nThe best test of any public man entrusted with the responsibility of\r\ngovernment is the opinion of disinterested foreign observers whose\r\nposition gives them the opportunity to judge. This opinion was voiced by\r\nMr. Leslie Combs, the American Minister Plenipotentiary to Guatemala, on\r\nthe occasion of a New Year's reception by President Estrada Cabrera\r\n(1905), when the diplomatic corps called on the President in a body.\r\nSpeaking for himself and for his colleagues of the Diplomatic Corps\r\nMinister Combs on that occasion said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Upon such an occasion as this criticism or compliment would alike\r\n     be out of place, but it may be permitted to mention the wonderful\r\n     development in Mexico in the past ten years, the great work now in\r\n     hand to the south and to predict that Guatemala in material wealth\r\n     and well-being has a great future before her. We hope this will be\r\n     realized in your next administration and that this year will\r\n     distinctly mark its advent.\r\n\r\n     \"The wise base their hopes of the future upon their experiences of\r\n     the past and we look to the peace and order maintained by your\r\n     administration in the past seven years as a guarantee that your\r\n     people may expect as much in those that are to follow.\r\n\r\n     \"We remember that called to your position of responsibility by a\r\n     tragedy you have firmly held the authority with which you have been\r\n     entrusted. We remember that by the diplomatic settlement of 1902,\r\n     by arbitration and negotiation, you have settled all the foreign\r\n     claims of importance against your government and have given rise to\r\n     not one yourself. We remember that hardly had the ashes cooled\r\n     after the terrible disaster of Santa Maria when railway spikes were\r\n     being driven to its base and the Mazatenango Railway opened, that\r\n     the Northern Railway contract seems to guarantee the completion of\r\n     that highway to the Atlantic at an early date.\r\n\r\n     \"These achievements in a period of depression, in the face of\r\n     natural phenomena of almost unparalleled destructiveness, warrant\r\n     the hope that conditions may enable you to direct the destiny of\r\n     Guatemala still further along on the highway to that position all\r\n     hope she may one day occupy. A noble field lies before you. That\r\n     you may be able to occupy it to the greatest advantage of your\r\n     country is our earnest wish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribute from Minister Combs, as will be noticed, especially\r\nemphasizes President Estrada Cabrera's qualities as a man of\r\nachievement. That is the keynote of his character, to do something for\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera is a civilian executive. His public life has\r\nbeen that of a lawyer eminent in his profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT OF LIBERAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nIn his participation in public affairs President Estrada Cabrera always\r\nhas supported liberal principles. It was therefore natural that he\r\nshould be prominent in the councils of the Liberal party and should\r\nbecome the leader of that organization. His career has been one to\r\nfamiliarize him with all the departments of the government. He served as\r\nSecretary of Government and Justice, and it was while, holding this\r\nposition that in order to investigate a land controversy he went out\r\ninto the wilderness himself and spent several weeks going over the\r\nsections concerning which he desired to be fully informed. The result\r\nwas that this controversy which had been in dispute for a long term of\r\nyears was finally settled in the manner most equitable and just for the\r\nparties interested. This is the way President Estrada Cabrera works when\r\nthe interests of the State are involved.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 when President-General Jose Maria Reyna Barrios was killed, Mr.\r\nEstrada Cabrera was _Primer Designado_, the position which corresponds\r\nto vice-president in the United States and under which he became acting\r\nPresident until an election could be held. At that election he was\r\nchosen President by a substantially unanimous vote. An indication of his\r\npublic policies was given by him when he outlined his programme on\r\ncoming into the responsibility for the government of Guatemala during\r\nthe interim which he served in the character of _Primer Designado_. On\r\nthat occasion he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"My administration will be brief and of a temporary character, but\r\n     not for that reason shall it be left for History to demand of me a\r\n     strict account of my acts during this period. I declare in the most\r\n     solemn manner before my fellow citizens that I wish to hand back\r\n     the beautiful standard of my country without stain. I desire that\r\n     the Constitution, the sacred repository of our liberties, be not\r\n     soiled in my hands. My hope is that all of my compatriots may enjoy\r\n     the life and public liberties that are rightfully theirs. I wish\r\n     that all the guaranties may protect them in the moment when they\r\n     approach the ballot boxes to cast their vote for the person to whom\r\n     it will be given to direct the destinies of our common country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after this declaration and after several months' experience under\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera's administration that in September, 1898, the\r\npeople chose him to fill out the full presidential term and then in 1904\r\nre-elected him for the term which will expire in 1911.\r\n\r\nWhen President Estrada Cabrera became charged with the full\r\nresponsibility of power in 1898, Guatemala was in the midst of political\r\ncomplications and of a very severe industrial crisis. His first labor\r\nwas to insure political tranquillity. When this was accomplished he gave\r\nall his energies and his talents to developing the resources of the\r\ncountry and to the improvement of public administration. From this point\r\na recent writer, confirming the eulogy of Minister Combs, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Guatemala now enjoys unalterable peace. Her progress is most\r\n     notable and instead of investing the public funds exclusively in\r\n     swords and cannons there have been instituted the annual festival\r\n     of Minerva, the most splendid work of Estrada Cabrera as ruler and\r\n     as patriot, arousing in this manner in the people the desire for\r\n     instruction and fostering by all possible means the material\r\n     progress of the country; giving facilities and opening new ways to\r\n     traffic and commerce; nourishing industries, science and the arts;\r\n     beautifying the cities and villages; affording to all the\r\n     advantages of modern improvements and spreading the knowledge of\r\n     hygiene among the masses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn a general way the administration of President Estrada Cabrera has\r\nbeen described as the political emancipation and the administrative\r\nemancipation. The former topic will be considered in the explanation of\r\nGuatemala's international relations. The administrative reforms which\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera has introduced are numerous. He has reduced in\r\na large measure the public debt and has paid almost entirely the\r\nrecognized foreign claims incurred by previous administrations, has\r\ngiven marked impulse to the construction of highways, bridges, and other\r\npublic works; has systematically fostered agriculture; has reformed and\r\nliberalized the Civil Codes and Proceedings; has extended the system of\r\nposts, telegraphs, and telephones; has established patriotic\r\ncelebrations of an industrial, agricultural, literary and scientific\r\ncharacter; has reorganized the army and the branch of military hygiene,\r\nhas enacted rigorous measures of quarantine against yellow fever,\r\nsmallpox, and the bubonic pests; has enlarged considerably the public\r\nschools and the charitable institutions by constructing the fine Asylum\r\nfor Invalids and Convalescents which bears his name: has improved the\r\nfiscal systems of the municipalities by bringing them to a modern basis,\r\nand has secured special advantages in supplying them with light, water,\r\nand other municipal necessities.\r\n\r\nGenerally it further may be said that Guatemala owes to President\r\nEstrada Cabrera:\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of her railway system.\r\n\r\nThe stability of the legal regimen.\r\n\r\nImportant reforms in land holdings in the interest of the small land\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThe institution of closer relations with all the nations of the world\r\nand especially with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of public credit.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory immigration policy.\r\n\r\nThe re-establishment and reorganization of the public school system, and\r\na great variety of other measures which form a solid foundation for the\r\ncontinued development of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR EDUCATION PROMOTED.\r\n\r\nPeople in the United States who believe in the \"Little Red School House\"\r\nas the basis of good citizenship cannot fail to appreciate how\r\nthoroughly President Estrada Cabrera has made primary education a part\r\nof his policy. In the midst of his many measures for the material\r\ndevelopment of the country he never has lost sight of the moral\r\nadvancement which comes from the school. He believes in education also\r\nas the very best means of creating and fostering the national patriotic\r\nspirit. During his first term he published a decree relating especially\r\nto the education of the youth of the country. He fixed the last Sunday\r\nof October of each year for the celebration of a popular festival\r\nthroughout the Republic consecrated exclusively to commemorate the\r\neducation of the youth of the country and requiring that all the\r\ndirectors, professors, teachers, and scholars of all the schools take\r\npart in it. This was known as the Festival of Minerva. It is a\r\nsentimental recognition of the value of education, and is the complement\r\nof the practical steps which have been taken. One of his first measures\r\non coming into the presidency in 1898 was to decree the reopening of the\r\npublic schools. From that time he exerted himself constantly to elevate\r\ntheir standing by providing them with the best facilities, by\r\nreorganizing them in conformity with the most modern plans, and in a\r\nword by encouraging their extension and their progress in every sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CABINET.]\r\n\r\nBesides the primary schools a system of higher education is supported,\r\nand there are normal schools and various faculties such as those of law,\r\nmedicine, engineering, etc. Especial attention, however, has been given\r\nto practical education, that is, the fitting of the common people for\r\ntheir occupations. There are schools of commerce, of manual training,\r\nand of agriculture, as well as an Institute especially for the native\r\nIndians. On this subject of technical education Consul General of the\r\nUnited States Winslow in a special report said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"There are few villages in the country where there are no schools.\r\n     In the city of Guatemala of late much attention has been given to\r\n     education, under the direction of President Manuel Estrada Cabrera,\r\n     who has done more along this line than any of his predecessors.\r\n     There are in the city of Guatemala 25 public schools, 8 institutes,\r\n     and 3 colleges.\r\n\r\n     \"President Estrada Cabrera has given much attention to his pet\r\n     scheme of establishing an industrial school for boys and girls at\r\n     his own personal expense, aided by several of the more progressive\r\n     citizens of Guatemala city, where the most improved methods of\r\n     instruction are to be employed. The President has engaged two able\r\n     educators from the United States, and proposes everything shall be\r\n     up-to-date.\r\n\r\n     \"The Boys' Industrial College is in charge of Prof. Y. C. Pilgrim,\r\n     a well-known educator of New Jersey, assisted by Professor\r\n     Bellingham and wife, who have charge of the languages, and\r\n     Professor Lorenzo de Clairmont, who instructs in gymnastics and\r\n     military tactics. These are assisted by several native teachers.\r\n     The boys are selected from the best families in the Republic and\r\n     are limited to 50, and are all required to live in the dormitory.\r\n     The college buildings are situated in a tract of land of about 60\r\n     acres, convenient to the city, with a campus where the boys are to\r\n     be instructed in the modern sports and military tactics as taught\r\n     at West Point, and all orders are to be given in the English\r\n     language.\r\n\r\n     \"The Girls' Industrial School is in charge of Miss Alice Dufour, a\r\n     prominent educator of New York City, assisted by several native\r\n     instructors. This institution is located in the city and is to be\r\n     conducted on the same high plan as the boys' college. The idea is\r\n     to teach the principles on which the American home is founded.\r\n\r\n     \"President Estrada Cabrera means these institutions shall be the\r\n     nucleus around which a solid and up-to-date system of education\r\n     shall be built for this Republic. It is his ambition to firmly\r\n     establish an educational system modeled after that in use in the\r\n     United States, where the watchword shall be industry, promptness,\r\n     and honesty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York _Tribune_ in a Washington dispatch had this to say on the\r\nsame subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"American teachers who went to Guatemala some time ago at the\r\n     request of the government are sending back interesting accounts of\r\n     the progress which that country is making in adopting the\r\n     educational methods that obtain in the United States. The\r\n     newspapers also have a good deal to say on the subject. President\r\n     Estrada Cabrera, who is a progressive man, for several years has\r\n     had the ambition to give a new turn to public instruction, and to\r\n     make it practical after the system of the United States. His idea\r\n     is that the youth of the Latin-American countries are especially in\r\n     need of newer methods, and of getting away from the metaphysical\r\n     systems which created a large class of professional men, for whom\r\n     there was no room and who were a drawback to material progress.\r\n\r\n     \"Some time ago President Estrada Cabrera established what was\r\n     called the practical school, which combined technical instruction\r\n     and manual training. A few weeks ago exercises were held at the\r\n     Escuela Practica, or technical school, and it is concerning this\r\n     that the New York teachers have written so encouragingly. The\r\n     President delivered an address on the value of work and of\r\n     developing through the schools an aptitude for everyday life.\r\n     Heretofore he said there had been too much theory and too much that\r\n     was purely professional in the system followed. Now that the\r\n     aspiration of many years had been realized he was hopeful that the\r\n     experiment would be beneficial in giving a new direction to the\r\n     national spirit, and would result in the kind of business training\r\n     that would fit the Guatemalan youth for the activities of practical\r\n     life rather than incline them to the traditions of the past. Under\r\n     the direction of the President fields for farm experiments have\r\n     been established, and the youth are taught the care of horses and\r\n     other farm work, as well as the manual trades. There is special\r\n     provision made for athletic sports.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Guatemala is republican--democratic and\r\nrepresentative--and the supreme power is exercised by three governmental\r\nbranches, each independent of the others, called \"the legislative\r\npower,\" \"the executive power,\" and \"the judicial power.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislative power is vested in a National Assembly which consists of\r\na single house composed of one deputy for each 20,000 inhabitants or\r\nfraction of that number exceeding 10,000. The deputies are elected by\r\npopular vote for four years, but one-half of the Assembly is renewed\r\neach two years so that each time that it meets it contains an adequate\r\nnumber of experienced members. Annual sessions are held lasting two\r\nmonths, beginning March 1, but they can be extended one month longer in\r\ncase of necessity. For the transaction of business during its recesses\r\nthe Assembly appoints seven of its members who form a body called \"the\r\nPermanent Commission.\" This commission, as well as the executive, can\r\ncall the Assembly to meet in extraordinary sessions.\r\n\r\nThe executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic, who,\r\nfor the transaction of public business, appoints six Ministers or\r\nSecretaries of State, who have charge of the portfolios of Foreign\r\nRelations, Government and Justice, the Treasury and Public Credit, War,\r\nPublic Works, and Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Council of State, a purely advisory body, which is\r\ncomposed of the Cabinet Ministers and nine other members, of whom five\r\nare appointed by the Assembly and four by the President. These\r\nappointments are for two years.\r\n\r\nThe judicial power is exercised by the courts and judges of the\r\nRepublic, organized as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Justice, which sits at the capital of Guatemala and\r\nis composed of the President of the Judicial Power, four Magistrates,\r\nand an Attorney (Fiscal).\r\n\r\nSix Courts or Tribunals of Appeals, composed of three Magistrates, of\r\nwhom one presides, and an Attorney (Fiscal). Three of these Courts sit\r\nat the Capital and one in each of the capitals of the Departments of\r\nQuezaltenango, Alta Verapaz, and Jalapa. The Magistrates and Attorneys\r\nare elected, by popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe Judges of the Courts of First Instance, of whom there are six in the\r\nCapital, three in Quezaltenango, two in San Marcos, and one in each of\r\nthe remaining Departments of the Republic. These Judges are appointed by\r\nthe Executive from three names proposed by the Supreme Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Justices of the Peace who pronounce oral judgments and are\r\nelected by the people of the districts in which they exercise their\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nFor the exercise of the political, civil, and military administration\r\nof the country it is divided into twenty-two Departments, each of which\r\nhas a Governor (Jefe Politico) invested with the executive functions.\r\nFor the administration of the local affairs of each district there are\r\npopularly elected Municipal Councils. The service of the members of the\r\nCouncils is for one year, is obligatory for the citizens of the\r\nrespective districts, and is not remunerated.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the Republic gives to all those who live in the\r\ncountry the most ample guaranties of liberty, equality, and security of\r\ntheir persons, their honor, and their property; of freedom of movement\r\nand of assembly, of professions, of industries, and of commerce; of the\r\nright to dispose of their property, to address petitions to the\r\nauthorities and to defend their interests before them; of liberty of\r\nconscience, inasmuch as there is no official religion; of the right to\r\nfreely express their opinions, whether by speech, or by writing, or by\r\nmeans of the press, without being subject to censure; of liberty to give\r\nor receive instruction, if they should so prefer, in private educational\r\nestablishments; of the right to have their residences, their property,\r\ntheir correspondence, and other papers respected as inviolable; of the\r\nright of _habeas corpus_; of liberty of defence in judicial proceedings,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nPrimary instruction is obligatory, and that which is sustained by the\r\nnation is secular and free. There is no imprisonment for debt. Marriage\r\nis considered a simple civil contract; but those who desire can have it\r\nsolemnized in a religious form. Absolute divorce can be obtained in\r\ncases defined by the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL AND ITS RICHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soil of Guatemala is remarkable in the vast extent and great variety\r\nof two classes of products which are unusual within the same degrees of\r\nlatitude, that is, it produces both tropical and temperate staples of\r\nagriculture in great profusion. The soil grows coffee, sugar-cane,\r\ncacao, bananas, tobacco, cotton, india rubber, vanilla, sarsaparilla,\r\nand a long list of medicinal plants, while it likewise produces the\r\ncereals, wheat and Indian corn, which are only found in temperate\r\nregions, giving two and in some places three crops of these annually.\r\nThere are also endless kinds of valuable hardwood, mahogany, rosewood,\r\nebony, cedar and the like, which are especially tropical timber, and at\r\nthe same time pine and oak exist in the mountain regions of the\r\ninterior. Besides all this the grasses grown are especially adapted to\r\nlive stock, and cattle raising and dairying are very profitable\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nThe British Consul General in an official report to the Foreign Office\r\nin London had this to say about the capabilities of the soil:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The tropical situation of the country, the proximity of every\r\n     portion to the sea on both coasts, the diversity of altitude and\r\n     consequently of temperature, combine to make the agricultural\r\n     capabilities of Guatemala equal to any in the world. Every kind of\r\n     crop, from those of the tropical coast regions to those of the cold\r\n     highlands (the latter having a climate corresponding with that of\r\n     northern Europe in summer) may be raised. There are districts where\r\n     even four crops of maize (Indian corn) are obtained in one year. It\r\n     is a common theory that the manures are unnecessary, as the heavy\r\n     rains wash down the rich soils from the sides of the mountains and\r\n     fertilize the plains. The great secret is therefore for the\r\n     agriculturist to adapt his cultivation to the nature of the soil\r\n     and climate and his interest would be advanced by a judicious\r\n     rotation of crops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA breezy description, though an accurate one, was given of the soil of\r\nGuatemala by a correspondent of the Washington _Star_. Wrote this\r\ncorrespondent:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of my own impressions of the country I would rather give\r\n     those of a North Carolina business man. He was taking the rest cure\r\n     by means of a sea voyage to San Francisco and deflected his\r\n     itinerary for a week's land journey. We traveled together to the\r\n     capital and also made a trip to the port of Champerico over the\r\n     railroad extension which has opened up new and untouched territory.\r\n     It was his first view of tropical lands except from the ship's\r\n     deck.\r\n\r\n     \"On landing at San Jose the North Carolina man looked with awe and\r\n     admiration as every tourist is bound to do on the dominating\r\n     volcano peaks Fuego and Agua, Fire and Water. But while he never\r\n     ceased to wonder at the richness of the scenery his practical\r\n     instincts asserted themselves and he punctuated the information\r\n     given him about climate, soil and products with keen observations.\r\n     He confessed that on the vessel he thought they were 'stringing'\r\n     him when they told him that the posts for the barbed wire fences\r\n     just grew, but when he saw countless miles of trees in straight\r\n     rows with the wire stretched along the trunks he paid his tribute\r\n     also to climate and soil. He knew that naturally trees don't grow\r\n     in straight rows and he found the explanation. The posts are poles\r\n     cut from the trees' branches and when stuck in the ground they\r\n     shoot up so rapidly that they soon are trees.\r\n\r\n     \"The North Carolina observer never got over his wonder at the soil.\r\n     The railroad cuts gave him a chance to see that it was not surface\r\n     richness and he easily grasped the explanation. The vegetation\r\n     grows to a certain height, then dies away, rots and forms fresh\r\n     layers of richness. This process going on for centuries has made\r\n     the fertility of the land inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n     \"The utility of volcanic eruptions was new to him and was explained\r\n     on the trip to Champerico. This is the great coffee region. It\r\n     comes within the sphere of influence of the volcano Santa Maria.\r\n     When Santa Maria was sprinkling both the sea and land with pumice\r\n     stone and ashes, on many of the fincas (plantations) there was just\r\n     enough of this lava soil after the rains had come and washed away\r\n     the surface of the deposit to renew the productiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another way an idea of the varied products of agricultural industry\r\ncan be had from an account given in the British Consular reports of a\r\nmodel plantation. This plantation consisted of 3,000 acres. In a given\r\nyear it produced 1,200,000 pounds of coffee, 300,000 pounds of sugar,\r\n300,000 bottles of the by-product of sugar known as aguardiente or cane\r\nrum, 22,000 gallons of milk. Two thousand head of cattle were raised. On\r\nthis plantation from 900 to 1,300 laborers were employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE OF WORLD-WIDE FAME.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Guatemala's most valuable agricultural product is\r\ncoffee. The fame of Guatemala coffee is worldwide and it commands the\r\nhighest prices. The production in average years is about 70,500,000\r\npounds, though in a recent year it exceeded 80,000,000 pounds. The most\r\nproductive regions are in the departments of Guatemala, Amatitlan,\r\nSacatepequez, Solola, Retalhuleu, Quezaltenango, San Marcos, Alta\r\nVerapaz, Baja Verapaz, Chimaltenango, Santa Rosa and Escuintla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISTA OF AGUNA PLANTATION.]\r\n\r\nThe altitudes at which the coffee plant is most successfully cultivated\r\nare between 1,500 feet and 5,000 feet above sea level, according to the\r\nlocality and quality of the soil. The temperature at which the greatest\r\nproductiveness is obtained varies from a minimum of 60 deg. Fahrenheit to a\r\nmaximum of 90 deg. In the lowlands the trees have to be shaded in order to\r\nprevent the leaves from being scorched by the heat. There is an\r\nabundance of native trees which answers this purpose. Occasionally, too,\r\nbananas are raised in conjunction with coffee since their broad leaves\r\nfurnish an excellent protection.\r\n\r\nIn districts where the mean altitude is 4,500 feet a different sort of\r\nprotection is necessary in order to shelter the coffee leaves from the\r\nnorthern winds which blow during the months of December, January, and\r\nFebruary. In these high altitudes the ranges of hills form the best\r\nnatural protection. To bring the coffee plant to full production from\r\nfive to seven years are required, though after two years the bush will\r\nproduce about two pounds of the berry annually. The coffee plants are\r\nraised in nurseries and afterwards transplanted to the cafetales or\r\ncoffee plantations. The critical season for the crop is the blooming\r\nperiod. A heavy rainfall while the trees are in flower will seriously\r\ndamage the plants by washing away the pollen and thus preventing\r\nfructification. This period lasts three or four days when the blossoms\r\nfall and the cherry or berry begins to appear. The cherry reaches\r\nmaturity in October and is ready for gathering and pulping, that is, for\r\nthe removal of the outer shell and pulp. After this process it is washed\r\nand carried to dry, spread out in brick paved yards exposed to the sun.\r\nThe grain is known as _pergamino_, or shell coffee, after the removal of\r\nthe red pulp, while it retains the inner white or yellow parchment\r\ncovering. After this parchment is removed it is known as _oro_, clean\r\ncoffee, and this is the common commercial term.\r\n\r\nSo many elements enter into the cost of planting and bringing to\r\nmaturity a coffee plantation that it is difficult to estimate the\r\nexpenditure necessary to ensure a given profit. Experienced coffee\r\ngrowers are guided largely by their knowledge of the local conditions\r\nand requirements. However, a reasonable amount of capital in the\r\nbeginning is necessary and many investors possessing the capital prefer\r\nto buy fincas or plantations that are already producing.\r\n\r\nThe government of Guatemala lays an export tax of one dollar in gold.\r\nGermany takes the bulk of the Guatemala product, though Great Britain is\r\na large buyer and the United States is receiving larger quantities from\r\nyear to year. With the increased facilities for transportation there\r\nwould appear to be an excellent opportunity for dealers to make a\r\nspecialty of Guatemala coffee in the United States, for the article once\r\nintroduced would be sure to have an increased consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR AND OTHER PROFITABLE PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Guatemala was producing barely enough sugar for its own\r\nconsumption. In 1904 it exported 6,000,000 pounds to the United States.\r\nNew Orleans is the nearest market, though shipments also may be made to\r\nBrooklyn. The product consists of white loaf sugar, panela or coarse\r\nbrown cakes, from which the cane rum is made, miel or molasses, and\r\nmascabado, or inferior grades. The sugar cane is of excellent quality\r\nand the production is abundant, especially along the hot coast\r\ndistricts. The departments of Escuintla, Amatitlan, and Baja Verapaz are\r\nthe districts in which the largest areas are under cultivation. As a\r\nrule the small sugar mills are crude and modern machinery has not been\r\nintroduced to a great extent, although the largest plantations are\r\nalready supplied with the latest improvements. With the introduction on\r\na larger scale of modern machinery and the latest processes the sugar\r\nindustry would be certain to afford satisfactory profits.\r\n\r\nCacao of a very high quality is produced in Guatemala and the native\r\narticle commands much higher prices than that produced in other\r\ncountries and brought to Guatemala for sale. The productive regions are\r\nthe _tierras calientes_ or hot coast lands. The principal cacao\r\nproducing districts are Escuintla, Suchitepequez, Solola, and\r\nRetalhuleu. The bean is most productive at an altitude of 800 to 2,000\r\nfeet. In some cases the shrub produces a pound of beans every four\r\nmonths and after reaching maturity it is said to produce without\r\ninterruption for one hundred years.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the superior quality of the Guatemala cacao the\r\nindustry has not been carried on systematically, possibly because five\r\nor six years are required to secure the first crop. In the last year the\r\ntotal output was only 34,000 pounds, but the steady demand for cacao and\r\nthe certainty of good prices justifies the investment of capital which\r\ncan await five or six years for the first returns. The gathering of the\r\ncacao beans requires very little machinery and few laborers. Chiefly\r\ncare must be taken not to hurt the bean or almond when breaking the\r\nfruit wherein they are contained. One day of fermentation must then be\r\ngiven to them, after which they remain exposed to the sun for six or\r\neight days, when they are ready to be sent to the market.\r\n\r\nOne of the most profitable of future industries in Guatemala undoubtedly\r\nis that of banana culture. There are vast productive regions on the\r\nAtlantic slope and these are certain to be cultivated since the building\r\nof the Northern Railway insures opening up the lands by giving access to\r\nthe New Orleans market within the time that is necessary for gathering\r\nand shipping the fruit. The annual production is now about 800,000\r\nbunches, of which one-half are consumed at home and the balance shipped\r\nto the United States. It is estimated that within a year after the\r\nNorthern Railway is completed the shipments to the United States will\r\nexceed 750,000 bunches per annum and will soon amount to 1,000,000\r\nbunches.\r\n\r\nTobacco is produced in a number of districts and there is much suitable\r\nsoil for it, but up to this time it has been raised only for local\r\nconsumption. Rice is also produced in the hot coast lands. Cotton is\r\ngrown and experiments have shown that the Sea Island cotton thrives in\r\nGuatemala.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBBER CULTIVATION AN INVITING FIELD.\r\n\r\nFor investments of capital that is willing to wait returns there is no\r\nmore inviting field than the cultivation of india rubber, which grows\r\nwild in Guatemala. Each year the demand for rubber increases and the\r\nprice rises. The coast regions where the wild tree flourishes are\r\nespecially adapted to the cultivation of the product. The subject has\r\nbeen given very careful attention by the Guatemalan government, which\r\ncaused investigation to be made by scientists who were familiar with the\r\nnative agriculture. The result of these investigations has been\r\npublished from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe wild gum tree is tall with smooth greenish white bark. The milk\r\nwhich is the mercantile product is contained principally in the fibres\r\nwhich are attached to the woody portion of the tree between it and the\r\nbark. The milk contains about 60% of water and other substances, while\r\nthe remaining 40% represents the salable product. The climate most\r\nappropriate for the growth of the rubber tree is that of the hot coast\r\nlands at an altitude not exceeding 1,500 feet. The yield of the\r\ncultivated rubber trees has been estimated as high as three pounds\r\nyearly from the sixth year, but the best authorities do not think that\r\nthe trees should be tapped before the ninth year and then the grower\r\nshould be satisfied with an annual yield of two and a half to three\r\npounds of milk, which will insure one pound of rubber.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the cost and probable yield of a rubber plantation as\r\nmade by Senor Horta, a leading authority, was that a plantation of\r\n100,000 trees would require ten caballerias (about 1,100 to 1,200\r\nacres), and would have cost after ten years about one dollar per tree.\r\nThis expense could in part be met by secondary cultivation. According to\r\nthe calculations one crop after ten years should produce double the\r\namount expended in that time.\r\n\r\nThe government encourages the cultivation of rubber, a decree having\r\nbeen issued in 1899 which provided that for every 20,000 rubber plants\r\nof four years of age and planted after the date of the decree the owner\r\nshould receive one caballeria (112 acres) of uncultivated national land.\r\nThe government, however, does not endorse nor recommend the promotion of\r\nrubber plantations by stock companies which seek chiefly to sell the\r\nstock among small investors in the United States. All such schemes\r\nshould be carefully investigated before the shares are bought and the\r\nleading facts in regard to rubber production, including the necessity of\r\na period of at least ten years for the successful development of a\r\nplantation, should be kept in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNTY FOR HENNEQUEN.\r\n\r\nThe soil of Guatemala in the opinion of experts is especially adapted to\r\nthe cultivation of fibre plants of which the most valuable is hennequen\r\nor hemp. Maguey or wild hennequen grows in various localities,\r\nparticularly in the eastern districts, where there is a large area which\r\nit is believed can be brought under profitable cultivation for\r\ncommercial purposes. President Estrada Cabrera, in order to encourage\r\nthe cultivation of hennequen, has provided that a bounty shall be paid\r\nto the cultivators of the plant, the scale of payment being graduated\r\naccording to the size of the plantation. Since it takes from four to\r\nfive years for the plant to mature the cultivators are allowed to\r\nreceive one-half the bounty two years after the hennequen is planted and\r\nthe balance at the end of the four years. A bounty is also to be paid\r\nfor the exportation of each 100 pounds of hennequen and the machinery\r\nnecessary on the plantation is to be imported free of duty. As a further\r\ninducement to engage in the cultivation of the fibre the natives who\r\nproduce hennequen are to be exempted from military service in a\r\nproportion fixed relatively to the number of acres under cultivation.\r\nThis experiment with hennequen is especially important in view of the\r\nfact that soil which is not suitable for coffee, sugar cane or cacao is\r\nthought to be especially well adapted to this plant.\r\n\r\nThe number of medicinal plants produced in Guatemala is infinite. One\r\nscientist gives a list of 339, which includes many balsams and the\r\naromatic plants, such as sarsaparilla and vanilla. The conditions of\r\nvanilla cultivation are similar to those in Mexico. The vine after five\r\nyears is in full bearing and will produce from 15 to 40 beans. It is\r\nestimated that a five-acre vanilla plantation will yield sufficient\r\nincome to render its owner independent, but this is only by the most\r\ncareful attention in cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY VARIETIES OF VALUABLE WOOD.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be 150 kinds of Guatemala wood which are commercially\r\nvaluable, and the number of species exceeds 400. The timber area\r\nincludes the littoral forests in a narrow belt along the Pacific and\r\nAtlantic coasts; the humid forests mixed with the prairie fields which\r\ncover the plains from the foot of the Andean Cordilleras to the Pacific;\r\nthe moist forests of the hot zone and the temperate zone found along the\r\nfoothills of the volcanic chain and in the northern and eastern parts of\r\nthe country; the humid forests of the cold zone; the pine and oak\r\nforests in the upland plains; the savannas and chaparral consisting of\r\nsmall trees and bushes; the savannas with pines along the Atlantic coast\r\nand the savannas of the cold zone on the highest tablelands of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nIn the report of the Intercontinental Railway Survey Lieutenant Hill\r\ngives a list of trees found in southeastern Guatemala which is another\r\nillustration of the varied timber resources of the country. The list is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nAconacaste, conacaste, guanacaste--a light brown wood rather soft and\r\nresembling inferior walnut.\r\n\r\nAmarillo--yellowish, hard, plentiful, strong; lasts well in water or\r\nground; used for pillars and girders in native houses.\r\n\r\nCedro--reddish, easily worked; used much for boards, not very strong,\r\nwarps easily.\r\n\r\nCaoba--mahogany.\r\n\r\nChichipate--hard, fine-grained; used in wagon-making.\r\n\r\nChiche--straight grained; lasts well above ground.\r\n\r\nChico--straight grained; takes high polish.\r\n\r\nGranadillo--dark brown, strong, plentiful; good for construction.\r\n\r\nGuachipilin--good for construction.\r\n\r\nGuapinol--hard, resembles oak in texture.\r\n\r\nJicaro--bears gourdlike fruit; plentiful on llanos, used in making\r\nsaddle-trees.\r\n\r\nLaurel--resembles chestnut; used for furniture.\r\n\r\nMadre cacao--hard, takes fine polish; good for posts.\r\n\r\nMario or Palo Colorado--a fine wood somewhat like mahogany.\r\n\r\nMatilishuate--grows large and straight; used for wagon boxes.\r\n\r\nMora--dyewood.\r\n\r\nJocote de Fraile--handsome wood, takes high polish.\r\n\r\nRonron--fine, hardwood, takes high polish.\r\n\r\nTempisque--reddish, resembles mahogany in weight and texture.\r\n\r\nVolador--fine tree, tall, straight trunk; good for bridges and roofs.\r\n\r\nWith such a vast wealth of timber the importance of the railway projects\r\nwhich open up the forest regions and make the markets of the United\r\nStates and Europe accessible will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCOURAGEMENT TO LIVESTOCK INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nCattle raising and dairy farming are among the most profitable\r\nagricultural industries of Guatemala, while horse-breeding also can be\r\nmade to pay unusually well. The native horse is small but very strong\r\nand is tireless. The race horses and others obtained through the\r\ncrossing with foreign breeds imported from the United States and from\r\nSpain, England and South America have given most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nDairy farming especially in the vicinity of the cities yields large\r\ndividends. The cattle are largely three-quarters or half-bred natives\r\nand Holsteins and Durhams. The pure native cows give much richer milk\r\nthan the imported stock, but they yield a very small quantity. The milk\r\nof the thoroughbred imported cows is thin, owing probably to the\r\nunsuitable nature of the fodder, and thus the half-bred cows are the\r\nmost profitable.\r\n\r\nThe highlands of the interior afford very fair grazing for cattle\r\nthroughout the year. The climate is mild and equable and the stock can\r\nremain in the pastures from January till December, while no losses are\r\nsuffered from severe weather in winter. Most of the country is well\r\nwatered. The native mules are superior to the horses for long journeys\r\nor heavy loads and as a rule they command higher prices. Pigs are raised\r\nwith little difficulty and fetch a high price, since pork is one of the\r\nfavorite foods on many of the plantations and in the villages inhabited\r\nby Indians. The hogs are allowed to run loose and feed on nourishing\r\nroots, acorns and maize. The sheep industry is capable of development at\r\nthe hands of experienced sheep-raisers. There are many flocks and the\r\nquality of both the mutton and the wool is capable of improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINES AND MINING.\r\n\r\nThe mineral riches of Guatemala, while not unknown, may be said to be\r\nunexploited. Owing to the varied geological formations the belief both\r\nof geologists and of practical miners is that they offer a promising\r\nfield for development. The minerals include quartz and gold, silver and\r\ngalenas, copper, coal and lignite, manganese, asbestos, graphite,\r\nkaolin, opals, slate, alum, marble, silver, mica, iron, sulphur, lead.\r\n\r\nThe mining archives of colonial days show that between the years 1627\r\nand 1820 more than 1,300 mines of gold, silver, lead, copper, tin, iron,\r\nand one of quicksilver, were discovered and worked, and were a source of\r\ngreat revenue both to the Church and the State. History records that\r\nduring the earliest Spanish occupancy of that country enormous\r\nquantities of gold and silver were taken from those mines. At one time\r\nmore than one hundred and fifty very rich mines were worked there. From\r\none group the mint of Guatemala coined silver to the amount of\r\n$43,000,000, besides what was shipped directly to Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER MOTAGUA RIVER.]\r\n\r\nIn an official report made by the Director of the chemical laboratory to\r\nthe Minister of Finance these statements are made, based on samples that\r\nhad been submitted for analysis and which were obtained for the most\r\npart in the eastern region of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Zinc, copper, lead, and silver predominate in these regions,\r\n     being generally found in argentiferous blends and galenas, and\r\n     sometimes both metals in conjunction with carbonates of copper. The\r\n     proportion of the lead varies from 20 to 25% in the galenas and the\r\n     blends contain from 15 to 40% of zinc.\r\n\r\n     \"The proportion of silver varies from 200 grammes to 7 kilos (17\r\n     pounds), allowing one to calculate on an average of from 2 to 3\r\n     kilos. The beds extend to the tablelands on which the capital is\r\n     situated, stretching as far as the Department of Jalapa, where the\r\n     lead disappears sometimes completely, the silver being found alone.\r\n     The veins stretch to the valley of the Motagua, disappearing for\r\n     some time on the left bank of that river and reappearing again to\r\n     the north of Solama, following a straight line to Huehuetenango,\r\n     although the quantity of silver in this region is less than in the\r\n     beds in the southeast of the Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"Copper, one of the metals which is most abundant in the country,\r\n     is generally found in oxicarbonate in beds of sediment. It appears\r\n     in the neighborhood of the capital and various other points. These\r\n     beds continue up to the Mexican frontier along the banks of the\r\n     river Salega and round the town of Cuilco, but the nature of the\r\n     metal changes little by little, passing from the carbonates to\r\n     oxisulphates mixed with iron and soon the copper disappears\r\n     altogether. In the eastern region abundant deposits of carbonates\r\n     of copper are found principally in the Department of Chiquimula,\r\n     mixed in many cases with other metals such as zinc, lead, and\r\n     silver.\r\n\r\n     \"Lignite of excellent quality is found in beds near the Atlantic\r\n     coast, a very great consideration in the development of mineral\r\n     industries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Rae of the United States, who spent several years in Guatemala\r\nand who wrote authoritatively concerning the mineral resources of the\r\ncountry, said that he had found near the northwestern frontier large\r\nquantities of low grade gold sulphuret ores and also rich lead ores\r\ncarrying a small percentage of silver as well as some good copper\r\ncarbonates. He said that the lead ores were of the best clean\r\ncarbonates, easily smelted by fuel alone, and had been rudely exploited\r\nprincipally for the lead they contained. These silver lead mines of low\r\ngrades of silver were in the vicinity of Chiantla, and the belt\r\nextended, he said, northwest, breaking out again in heavy deposits\r\nbearing silver from $12 to $40 a ton and lead 80%.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rae gave the following further details:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Still further east in the Lacodor country are found immense\r\n     deposits of the same character of ore, which seemed to lie as if\r\n     thrown up in volcanic upheavals. In some places the lead is found\r\n     in small nuggets entirely pure. Large deposits of black lead or\r\n     plumbago exist both north and south of Huehuetenango of a good\r\n     class and ready for commerce.\r\n\r\n     \"Auriferous gravel beds are found at different points on the Rio\r\n     Grande in the Department of Baja Verapaz which prospect well for\r\n     heavy course gold. The working of these beds is confined to the\r\n     immediate river banks, done by the natives in a very rude manner,\r\n     merely scooping out the choicest streaks of goldbearing gravel and\r\n     washing it in wooden bowls. These beds seem to be well defined and\r\n     extend back through the flats to the hills.\r\n\r\n     \"Also some gold formation is found along the Rio Platanos and Vacas\r\n     two affluents of the Rio Grande that flow into it from the south\r\n     side and nearly opposite to one of these goldbearing gravel beds.\r\n     Further down the river on the north mountain range there exists\r\n     asbestos in several places and from a surface prospect the texture\r\n     is of a good variety and free from all foreign substances varying\r\n     in color from deep gray to snowy white, the fibres measuring as\r\n     much as 6 inches in length.\r\n\r\n     \"In the Department of Izabal lying on the Atlantic or gulf coast,\r\n     on the lower waters of the Motagua and Polichis rivers, there\r\n     exists rich and extensive beds of gold placers which have been\r\n     worked for several years in a primitive way and have yielded a\r\n     large amount of gold dust.\r\n\r\n     \"In the foothills of Livingston stone coal has been found of the\r\n     lignite variety and said to make good combustible. On the opposite\r\n     side of the Gulf of Dulce from the coal deposits are large deposits\r\n     of magnetic iron ores, ranging from 60 to 70 per cent. of iron.\r\n     These deposits lie only a few leagues from water communication on\r\n     the Gulf and also close to the Northern Railway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following description of the various mineral districts is from _The\r\nBristol Board of Trade journal_:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The principal known mining districts of Guatemala are situated on\r\n     the eastern boundary, both to the north and also the south, in the\r\n     Departments of Chiquimula and Izabal, adjoining the Republic of\r\n     Honduras and that of Salvador. These districts are mountainous,\r\n     and, owing to their complete isolation and lack of communication\r\n     with the other parts of the Republic and the difficulty of\r\n     procuring supplies, there being at the moment very few roads, this\r\n     part is not generally known to the outer world.\r\n\r\n     \"On the western boundary, in the Department of Huehuetenango and\r\n     near to Chiantla, there are said to be very rich copper mines,\r\n     similar to those of Chiapas, in Mexico. These are now being\r\n     explored, but so far no copper has been found, though the district\r\n     is rich in lead and a small percentage of silver. The assays that\r\n     have come to hand show 56 per cent. of lead and 40 ounces per ton\r\n     of silver. In many other parts of the Republic mines have been\r\n     discovered and mining rights secured, such as at San Cristobal and\r\n     Aguil, in the Department of Alta Verapaz; near Rabinal and Pichec,\r\n     in Baja Verapaz; at San Pedro, in the Department of Guatemala; also\r\n     at Mataquescuintla, in the mines of Algeria and Rosario, in the\r\n     Department of Santa Rosa; at Zalcuapa and Joyabaj, on the Rio\r\n     Grande, in the Department of El Quiche; but the only mines that\r\n     have recently been worked, and which have given and are giving fair\r\n     results, are those of Quebradas de Oro, on the River Bobos, in the\r\n     Department of Izabal, where gold has been washed in paying\r\n     quantities.\r\n\r\n     \"The district where mines have been denounced (pre-empted) and in\r\n     some instances worked, lies between the Rio de Concepcion to the\r\n     north and the Rio de las Minas to the south; the mining district\r\n     alluded to is nearly due east of Los Sillones, on the finca of San\r\n     Jose. This estate is in the Department of Chiquimula, and a society\r\n     was formed under the name of Societe Horta y Cia., which obtained\r\n     mining rights from the Government for a term of fifteen years with\r\n     the right to import free of duty all material, machinery, and\r\n     necessary appliances. But until the present time very little has\r\n     been done, owing to the isolated position of these mines and the\r\n     difficulty of establishing communication, though the construction\r\n     of a small line, which might connect with the Guatemala or Northern\r\n     Railway at Chiquimula, has been under consideration, but the funds\r\n     for the carrying out of this project have, it is understood, been\r\n     lacking. This, if built, would do away with the transportation\r\n     difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in the work of mining in Guatemala since the\r\nclimate in the mining regions is temperate and healthful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRADE AND MARKETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuatemala, because of its nearness, is an unusually good market for the\r\nproducts of the United States. With the increase in the transportation\r\nfacilities which will result from railway building and other\r\ntransportation enterprises that will add to the ocean shipping\r\nfacilities the business should increase greatly if merchants and\r\nmanufacturers in the United States choose to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nOfficial support is given this view by the reports of the American\r\nConsuls in Guatemala. Consul General Winslow has frequently called\r\nattention to the advantages which may be obtained. In one report he\r\nstated that large quantities of groceries, flour, potatoes, shoes,\r\ndrygoods, and clothing come from the United States, but Germany and\r\nEngland seem to have the lead in machinery and hardware. There is surely\r\na fine opening in these latter lines for exporters of the United States,\r\nbut they must be in position to push their goods personally, to give\r\nlonger credits, and to take more pains with packing. In all, it is safe\r\nto say, there are $8,000,000 of American capital invested in Guatemala\r\nand there is an opening for much more, if it is backed by the right kind\r\nof management.\r\n\r\nIn a report, to the British Foreign Office in 1905 Mr. Hervey, the\r\nEnglish Consul, stated that as far as actual volume of business was\r\nconcerned, as shown in the imports and exports, there appeared to have\r\nbeen a distinct improvement in the general trade of the country compared\r\nwith immediately preceding years. The imports were the largest for the\r\npast seven years. The revenue of the country showed a great improvement\r\nall around, being, in fact, nearly double that of 1903, the most\r\nimportant increases being shown in import and export duties, the former\r\nbenefiting by the 50 per cent. of their total payable in gold, and the\r\nlatter by the tax of $1 gold per quintal which has been collected\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the future was, the report said, more favorable than it\r\nhad been for many years. The completion of the Guatemala Northern\r\nRailway would shorten the distance from Europe and the United States and\r\npromote trade. Already German and British steamers were calling at\r\nPuerto Barrios in addition to those of the United Fruit Company. The\r\ngreater steadiness of exchange and the fall in the gold premium were\r\nfurther factors of importance in restoring confidence. With continued\r\npeace, and with it the prospect of increased labor facilities, so that\r\nthe agricultural and mineral wealth to be won from the soil may attain\r\nto its fullest development, brighter days were dawning for Guatemala.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES BROUGHT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nA general statement regarding the articles which Guatemala buys abroad\r\nand which therefore are of interest to exporters is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe principal imports consist of drygoods, almost exclusively cotton\r\nmanufactures, brought from Great Britain, the United States, and\r\nGermany. In this branch British manufacture commands the market, the\r\nimports from the United States and Germany being relatively small. The\r\nmore important articles are gray cloths; bleached shirtings, 7-8 and 9-8\r\nprints; fancy cloths; gray, white, and blue drills; colored drills;\r\nhandkerchiefs; gray and dyed yarns; Turkey red yarns; sewing cottons;\r\ntrimmings; cotton blankets, etc. Of these goods about 75 per cent. are\r\nof British origin, 15 per cent. American, and 10 per cent. German.\r\nAmerican manufacturers compete chiefly in drills, denims, blankets,\r\nprints, gray cloths, and bleached shirtings, while German goods imported\r\nconsist chiefly of drills, prints, Turkey red yarns, blankets, and\r\ntrimmings.\r\n\r\nWoolen goods are not in very great demand; the principal lines are\r\nblankets, shawls, braids, hats, Berlin wool, and but few piece goods.\r\n\r\nHats are imported mostly from the United States, Germany, and only a few\r\nfrom the United Kingdom; shawls from Germany, principally; piece goods\r\nfrom Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSilks are not in demand, excepting floss silks imported from China,\r\nribbons from Switzerland, France, and Germany. Regarding hardware\r\ngenerally, approximately 50 per cent. is imported from Germany, 30 per\r\ncent. from the United States, and 20 per cent. from the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe principal imports from the United States consist of machetes, axes,\r\nand hoes, besides tools generally of the better classes, corn mills,\r\nplows, sewing machinery, outfits for building purposes, saws, barbed\r\nwire, files, screws, cutlery, ropes, brushes, enameled goods, paints,\r\nand varnishes and breadstuffs.\r\n\r\nThe imports from the United Kingdom are chiefly composed of\r\ngalvanized-iron sheets, galvanized-iron goods, coffee machinery, copper\r\nsheets, tin goods, machetes, hoes, sickles, picks, pickaxes, saltpeter,\r\npans (used on sugar plantations), iron sheets, saws, padlocks, cutlery,\r\nsaddlery, bits, spurs, brass valves and cocks, pottery, cartridges, also\r\npreserves and biscuits.\r\n\r\nFrom Germany are brought all kinds of cheap tools, machinery, sewing\r\nmachines, cutlery, machetes, bar iron, enameled goods, pottery, locks,\r\nscrews, nails, window glass, brushes, paper, matches, stearin and\r\nceresin, part of these goods being also brought from Belgium and the\r\nNetherlands, while France ships tools for shoemakers' and saddlers' use.\r\n\r\nThe articles which Guatemala buys in exchange for her coffee, sugar,\r\nfruits, woods and other products in the customs classification are\r\ndivided into three groups; that is, articles of prime necessity,\r\narticles of luxury or convenience, and articles for the industries.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important group includes cotton and woolen goods,\r\nwheat flour, rice, corn, potatoes, salt, wax and stearine candles,\r\nmatches, soap, petroleum, glass and earthenware, and kitchen hardware.\r\n\r\nThe second group covers the finer grade of woolens, silks, mineral\r\nwaters, liquors, preserves in cans, manufactured tobacco, glassware,\r\nporcelain, toys, musical instruments, perfumery, etc.\r\n\r\nThe third group consists of coal, woodworking machinery, cured hides,\r\nraw cotton, sacks, lubricating oils, farm implements and a variety of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS OF IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe shipments with which up to this time the United States has been most\r\nsuccessful in furnishing Guatemala can be understood from a summary of\r\nthe articles sent out under a consular invoice from various ports. The\r\nexportations from the port of New Orleans during a recent year were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n       NAME OF ARTICLES.

The principal articles are flour, wheat, hops,\r\ncorn, barley, oats, cotton, furniture, machinery, beers, wines, and\r\nwhiskies. The articles imported at San Francisco are chiefly coffee,\r\nsugar, cacao, rubber, hides and lumber.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE COMMERCE IS DIVIDED.\r\n\r\nWhile the United States has a fair share of the trade the proportion is\r\nnot as large as it might be if systematic efforts were made. In the last\r\nyear for which statistics are available the foreign commerce of\r\nGuatemala amounted to $12,593,000, of which $5,041,000 was imports and\r\n$7,552,000 exports. Germany, which takes the bulk of the coffee crop, is\r\nthe largest consumer. In the year quoted it took 53.79% of the total\r\nexportations from Guatemala North America (chiefly United States)\r\n25.86%. England, 15.37%, and France 2.4%.\r\n\r\nThe exportation of the various countries to Guatemala in percentage\r\nterms was as follows: United States 36.59%; England, 22.62%; Germany,\r\n19.97%; France, 9.21%; South America, 2.82%; Central America, 1.83%;\r\nMexico, 1.69%; Spain, 1.54%; Italy, 1.32%; Belgium and Holland, 1.27%;\r\nother countries, 1.14%.\r\n\r\nIn detail the value of the goods imported by Guatemala in the given\r\nyear was: from Germany, $1,019,000; United States, $1,442,000; England,\r\n$1,038,000; France, $175,000; Belgium, $114,000. No other country except\r\nthe above exported to Guatemala goods exceeding $100,000 in value. Of\r\nthe exports from Guatemala, chiefly coffee, as previously stated,\r\nGermany took $3,508,000; the United States $2,292,000; England,\r\n$1,282,000.\r\n\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera in his annual message commented on the balance\r\nof trade in favor of Guatemala and expressed himself very hopefully\r\nconcerning the measures of internal development which could be carried\r\non while the conditions of foreign commerce were so satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSince a portion of the revenue of Guatemala is raised from the export\r\ntax on coffee it is possible to maintain a very moderate schedule of\r\nimport duties and this is done. The average duty on the group of\r\narticles described under the heading of prime necessity is 23.67% _ad\r\nvalorem_. On the second group 30.84% and on the third group 7.60%. The\r\nduties are equitably distributed so as to bear lightly on everything\r\nthat enters into the industrial upbuilding of the country. Moreover,\r\nspecial concessions are sometimes made on material for railway and other\r\nenterprises which enter into the national development.\r\n\r\nThe general rules regarding the application of the tariff are very\r\nclear. They are formulated with a view to saving annoyance to shippers\r\nand are specific enough to avoid uncertainty. Import duties are not\r\nhigh. The list of articles which it is prohibited to import is a short\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe charges for invoices on shipments to Guatemala are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Ship's manifest                              $10.00.\r\n     Validating invoices of from  $1 to $100        7.00.\r\n          \"         \"        \"   100  \"  500       10.00.\r\n          \"         \"        \"   501  \" 1000       14.00.\r\n          \"         \"        \"  1001  \" 3000       16.00.\r\n          \"         \"        \"  3001  \" 6000       20.00.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor each additional $1000 the Consuls will collect $2.\r\n\r\nThe government officials of Guatemala and the merchants gave hearty\r\nsupport to the project of an exposition ship or floating exposition\r\nwhich was undertaken on the Pacific coast in order to display American\r\nproducts and manufactures and at the same time familiarize American\r\nfirms with the products of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCHANGE AND BANKS.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of its foreign commerce reasonably long credits are\r\nrequired by the merchants of Guatemala, but always under fixed\r\nconditions. When the coffee crop is shipped bills on Europe and on New\r\nYork can always be procured at reasonable exchange and the obligations\r\nbe met in this manner. Since the balance of trade is in favor of\r\nGuatemala there is always the certainty of funds for exchange.\r\n\r\nUnder President Estrada Cabrera's administration the banks of the\r\ncountry are subject to a regulation somewhat similar to the national\r\nbanks of the United States. Various decrees have been issued governing\r\nthe emission of banknotes. The latest decree institutes a special bank\r\nexamination project and requires all the financial institutions to give\r\nan account of their condition and operations to this Department.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics as to the leading banks of Guatemala have been\r\ncompiled from recent reports:\r\n\r\n\r\nGUATEMALAN BANK (BANCO DE GUATEMALA).\r\n\r\n     Capital subscribed and totally paid    $2,500,000 00\r\n     Reserve fund                              655,000 00\r\n     Contingent fund                           292,208 67\r\n     Fund available for dividends              200,000 00\r\n\r\n     Manager: Carlos Gallusser.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCIDENTAL BANK (BANCO DE OCCIDENTE).\r\n\r\n     Capital authorized          $2,000,000 00\r\n     Capital paid                 1,650,000 00\r\n     Reserve fund                 1,200,000 00\r\n     Contingent fund              1,200,000 00\r\n\r\n     Manager: Rufino Ibarguen.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL BANK (BANCO INTERNACIONAL).\r\n\r\n     Capital subscribed and totally paid    $2,000,000 00\r\n     Reserve fund                            1,507,000 00\r\n     Contingent fund                           281,918 76\r\n\r\n     Manager: Carlos B.

Prentice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these are banks of emission and discount with headquarters in\r\nGuatemala City and with branches in the other principal cities of the\r\ndepartments. They also to some degree supply the place of mercantile\r\nagencies and report financial standing of individuals, firms and\r\ncompanies upon solicitation.\r\n\r\nIt is known to be the great ambition of President Estrada Cabrera to\r\nplace the finances of Guatemala on a solid basis during his present\r\nterm. The rate of exchange under the stability now afforded and the\r\nimproved industrial and commercial conditions has been steadily falling.\r\n\r\nA final word concerning the opportunities for American enterprise is\r\nconvincing when it comes from official sources. In one of his reports\r\nConsul General Winslow said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"During the past few months the exporters of the United States have\r\n     been doing some effective work in this Republic. There have been\r\n     several commercial travelers here studying the conditions and\r\n     taking sample orders. Many others have been asking for information\r\n     from this Consulate-General, which has been able to give valuable\r\n     information. If this field is properly worked and sufficiently long\r\n     credit is given, practically nothing but American goods need be\r\n     found in the markets of Guatemala, for they are generally conceded\r\n     to be the best. This market is worth cultivating, for the next few\r\n     years will see great development here. Everything points that way,\r\n     and the natural resources are great. The opening up of the new\r\n     railroad to the Atlantic coast at Puerto Barrios will do wonders\r\n     for the country. More attention is being paid to the packing of\r\n     goods shipped to this country. It is an important matter and cannot\r\n     have too much attention on the part of exporters. Packages should\r\n     be very firmly nailed and bound by band iron, so they would be\r\n     difficult to open, as there is much complaint about goods being\r\n     stolen from boxes in transit. I have had several compliments of\r\n     late from the custom officers for the way shipments of American\r\n     goods have come packed. It will pay exporters to pack well\r\n     everything they ship. Dollars spent in this line will bring\r\n     hundreds in profits. This is especially true for Central American\r\n     ports.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplementary to the above was a report from Vice-Consul General Owen in\r\nwhich these observations were made:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The following drygoods of American manufacture are becoming quite\r\n     popular here: Brown cotton, all grades; cotton duck, Lindale, up to\r\n     6 ounces; light domestics; long cloth; gingham; cotton drill,\r\n     checks and stripes (cheviot); blue and brown cotton drill; fancy\r\n     calicoes and lawns; cotton ware, all colors. The piece of 24 yards\r\n     is the most popular, although cotton cheviots, gingham, etc., come\r\n     put up in larger pieces. Dress patterns in lawn and calico are\r\n     frequently imported.\r\n\r\n     \"It must be borne in mind that the importers of this Republic are\r\n     for the greater part Germans, and their interest and inclination\r\n     lead them to trade with the fatherland. England also is preferred\r\n     over the United States, possibly because Guatemala merchants can\r\n     more easily identify themselves in England and get better credits.\r\n     American goods therefore are imported only when their quality\r\n     places them so far ahead of the European article that the merchant\r\n     is almost compelled to have them in stock. The American\r\n     manufacturers should become better acquainted with this trade,\r\n     ascertain who are worthy of credit, and extend it. The long voyage\r\n     and delay _en route_ compel the importer to ask long credits. It is\r\n     sometimes two or three months after shipments destined for this\r\n     city leave the manufacturer before they can be displayed in the\r\n     store of the importer. The custom duty on about all cotton goods is\r\n     collected on gross weight of the package. Great care should be\r\n     taken with invoices for custom-house purposes; the goods must be\r\n     described in exact phraseology of Guatemala custom tariff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND IMMIGRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of Guatemala according to the general census of the\r\nRepublic taken at the beginning of 1904 was 1,842,000. This was the\r\nactual enumeration, but as there were many cases in which a complete\r\naccount was not possible the inhabitants probably number 2,000,000. Of\r\nthose enumerated by races 750,615 were Ladinos, and 1,091,519 were of\r\nthe aboriginal race. The Ladinos are the descendants of the white race\r\nand of a mixture of European and Indian. The Indian population is\r\nprincipally engaged in farming and in small commercial enterprises in\r\nthe interior. The Ladinos are much more energetic. The natives of the\r\nhigh and cold regions are the most vigorous.\r\n\r\nFor many years it has been the aim of the Guatemalan government to\r\nattract foreign immigration. Under President Estrada Cabrera's\r\nadministration systematic measures for this purpose have been taken and\r\nthe policy of encouraging immigrants and colonists, especially from the\r\nUnited States, has become a settled one. Practically one-half the\r\nfertile territory is yet uncultivated for want of tenants and there are\r\nmany agricultural industries which require a very small amount of\r\ncapital while they assure independence to those who follow them.\r\n\r\nThe first question asked is whether the natives of the temperate\r\nregions, Europeans and North Americans, can live and work in the\r\nclimate. The answer is that there are large areas suitable for them\r\nwhere they may engage in coffee-growing, dairying, stock-raising and\r\nsimilar occupations.\r\n\r\nThe districts known as the Highlands or \"Los Altos\" are at an average\r\nelevation of 5,000 feet and comprise some of the most inviting sections\r\nof Guatemala. The uplands include Quezaltenango, Solola, Quiche,\r\nHuehuetenango, Totonicapam, and San Marcos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THREE ZONES.\r\n\r\nUsually in describing the country it is divided into three zones. The\r\n_tierra caliente_, or hot lands, comprise the coast of the Atlantic and\r\nthe Pacific ocean.\r\n\r\nThe _tierra templada_, or temperate zone, covers the central plains\r\nwhich range from 2,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\nThe _tierra fria_, or cold zone, comprises the highlands as noted above.\r\n\r\nThe year is divided into two seasons, the winter or rainy season lasting\r\nfrom May till October, and the dry season. The hottest months are March\r\nand April and the coldest ones December and January. Except along the\r\ncoast the average temperature throughout the year is about 72 deg.\r\nFahrenheit. The climate on the coast is rendered endurable by the\r\nrefreshing sea breezes which blow for several hours every day. Many\r\npeople who live in the uplands in the rarefied atmosphere find it\r\nagreeable and beneficial to their health to spend a few weeks every\r\nseason on the coast lands. The climate would be hot and moist except for\r\nthe variations caused by the mountains which oppose themselves not only\r\nto the prevailing winds but also in rainfalls to the humidity of the\r\nair. The winds are from the east and north, although along the Pacific\r\ncoast there are southern and southwestern winds at certain times in the\r\nyear. In regard to rainfall the general rule is that the regions\r\nconfronting the moist winds from the ocean have abundant precipitation\r\nwhile those defended by mountain ranges from the sea winds are dry.\r\n\r\nThe climate taking the country as a whole is an unusually healthy one.\r\nFevers are not common and when they exist are confined to the warm and\r\nhumid coast regions. No peculiar climatic disease exists in Guatemala\r\nand the country rarely suffers from epidemics. This is largely due to\r\nthe strict sanitary measures which are enforced by the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nA POETICAL AND PRACTICAL DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the climate in popular language is given by a\r\nwell-known authority:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The territory of the Republic belongs to the torrid zone comprised\r\n     among the intertropical countries which are exempt from the\r\n     rigorous winters of the countries of Europe, North and South\r\n     America, and the Far East. The vegetation which droops in the dry\r\n     season recovers a marvelous exuberance in the season of the rains.\r\n     In every part it is encountered then rehabited in the most splendid\r\n     garb of nature. The tropical countries at this period certainly are\r\n     the motherland of all the plants which are cultivated throughout\r\n     the world when as in the case of our Republic there are hot,\r\n     temperate and cold zones in which the vegetation is perpetual and\r\n     flourishes in the regions which possess perennial springs of\r\n     flowing water to moisten the cultivated lands in the season of the\r\n     drouths.\r\n\r\n     \"The knowledge of the climates is of the highest importance for the\r\n     agriculturist. It is his guide in the experiments for acclimatizing\r\n     exotic plants which he seeks to introduce into his properties.\r\n\r\n     \"The climate of a locality varies through the background of the\r\n     mountains, through its sloping direction, its nearness to the sea,\r\n     to the lakes, and to the selvas; through the direction and the\r\n     forces of the periodical winds.\r\n\r\n     \"Setting out from the low coastlands and ascending to the regions\r\n     of the Altos or highlands, the naturalist admires successively the\r\n     exuberant vegetation of the tropics and that of the cold countries.\r\n\r\n     \"On account of the topography of the territory we have in the\r\n     different zones of the Republic different climates characterized by\r\n     our two seasons--that of the rains, our winter, and that of the\r\n     dryness, our summer; characterized too by the intensity of the heat\r\n     in the low zones of the coasts and by the crisp cold in the high\r\n     plateaus of our mountains; by the force and duration of the\r\n     periodic winds of the Northwest which in certain regions of the\r\n     Republic blow with a violence harmful to agriculture.\r\n\r\n     \"The temperature in the low zones fluctuates between 26 deg. and 35 deg.\r\n     centigrade, averaging 28 deg. In the zones ranging from 3,000 to 5,000\r\n     feet above sea level the temperature fluctuates between 16 deg. and\r\n     24 deg., the average being 20 deg. to 22 deg. centigrade. In the high zones or\r\n     cold lands the temperature varies from 8 deg. to 15 deg., the medium being\r\n     12 deg. or 13 deg. In these zones from December to the end of March the\r\n     temperature drops during the night to 1 deg. centigrade and other times\r\n     to 3 deg. or 4 deg.\r\n\r\n     \"The rains commence in May or June and continue until the middle of\r\n     November. They are most violent from July to October. In the months\r\n     of September and October there are sometimes storms and copious\r\n     rains which last almost continuously from one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n     \"Heavy dews are numerous and at times very copious in the summer in\r\n     the low zones close to the sea, the lakes and the big marshes and\r\n     also in the higher zones through the condensation of the vapors\r\n     which absorb the sun's rays and become more condensed on reaching\r\n     the colder regions of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     \"The northeast winds are periodical and blow almost without\r\n     interruption throughout the summer and with great violence on the\r\n     coasts of the north and in the eastern sections of the country. The\r\n     winds on the south coast are much milder and those in the western\r\n     sections are insignificant.\r\n\r\n     \"Under this drouthlike action the vegetation withers in the hot and\r\n     dry zones. It flourishes most in the districts which possess\r\n     perennial springs of running water for fertilizing.\r\n\r\n     \"In the season of the rains there are strong hurricanes of southern\r\n     winds which cause damage to agriculture, but happily they are not\r\n     frequent.\r\n\r\n     \"From the description of the varied climates of the Republic it\r\n     will be seen that they are adapted to the cultivation of the\r\n     richest tropical plants and for all the agricultural and industrial\r\n     produce which is cultivated in the cold and temperate zones of the\r\n     entire world.\r\n\r\n     \"Besides, its vegetative season is one of perpetual cultivation,\r\n     and in the plantations which possess water for irrigating the\r\n     cultivated lands three crops a year can be raised in the hot zones\r\n     as well as the temperate regions, and two crops of the cereals,\r\n     wheat and Indian corn, in the cold regions; that is to say, the\r\n     feeding of 30,000,000 inhabitants is possible besides fruits for a\r\n     very extensive exportation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS TO AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nIn a country so largely agricultural as Guatemala is the measures for\r\nthe encouragement of farming may be taken as a means of judging the\r\ninterest shown by the government. On this point President Estrada\r\nCabrera in a recent message said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Agriculture as the prime factor of our richness has been the\r\n     object of special attention during the last seven years of my\r\n     administration. In order to broaden and improve it there has been\r\n     established in the capital the General Department of Agriculture\r\n     and in the districts and municipalities Boards for the same\r\n     purpose. This Department has been authorized to publish a\r\n     periodical _The Bulletin of Agriculture_ which is given over\r\n     exclusively to important farming studies. Seeds and plants have\r\n     been brought from other countries and distributed among our farmers\r\n     in order to establish new sources of production. Strict orders have\r\n     been issued to secure the cultivation of the largest areas possible\r\n     and also for establishing common seed grounds. Regulations have\r\n     been made for the exploitation of rubber. In every possible manner\r\n     the importation of farm tools and agricultural machinery has been\r\n     facilitated. Contracts have been made for the exploitation of the\r\n     woods in the forests of the north. Schools of agriculture have been\r\n     created in order to further the study of these subjects by the\r\n     issue of special bulletins under the direction of the Department of\r\n     Agriculture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STREET IN ESCUINTLA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADING POINTS OF IMMIGRATION LAW.\r\n\r\nA general immigration law was passed several years ago which has been\r\nsupplemented by other laws since that time. At the outset immigration\r\ncontracts with the Chinese are prohibited and the latter are not to be\r\naccepted as immigrants. The purpose of this is to insure white\r\nimmigration and to prevent cheap coolie labor of a temporary character\r\ninterfering with settlers who wish to establish themselves permanently.\r\nImmigrants are described as those foreigners having a profession,\r\noccupation or trade, whether day laborers, artisans, workingmen in\r\nfactories, farmers or professors, who give up their own homes to come\r\nand settle in Guatemala and accept their transportation to be paid\r\neither by the Guatemalan government or by an immigration company.\r\nImmigrants also include the foreigners whose transportation is not paid\r\nby the government or by private companies. The wearing apparel and\r\nhousehold furniture, tools, domestic animals and other possessions of\r\nimmigrants are entered at the custom-house free of duty.\r\n\r\nAn important provision authorizes the government to grant gratuitously\r\nto immigrants lots of public lands in certain districts provided that\r\nthe immigrants bind themselves to cultivate within two years the third\r\npart of the land granted. For this purpose zones of tillable land are\r\nset apart in the districts named.\r\n\r\nImmigrants are exempted for a period of four years after their arrival\r\nfrom service in the construction or repair of the public roads and from\r\nthe payment of municipal taxes. They are also exempted from military\r\nservice except in the case of foreign war. They enjoy all the rights and\r\nprivileges granted by law to Guatemalan citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LANDS FOR SETTLERS.\r\n\r\nUnder a general law a body of official engineers was created for\r\nsurveying and distributing the uncultivated public lands and fixing the\r\nprices therefor. The price varies according to the nature of the land,\r\nwhether it is for grazing, raising cereals; whether capable of raising\r\nsugar, banana, etc.; whether adapted to coffee and cotton, or whether it\r\ncontains forests. Public lands may also be granted to immigrants\r\ngratuitously. Information on these points can be had through\r\ncorrespondence with the Department of Agriculture called \"Direccion\r\nGeneral de Agricultura,\" in Guatemala City.\r\n\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera's land policy has been directed especially to\r\nprevent great areas from being kept out of cultivation. He has dictated\r\nmany measures with the purpose of breaking up the huge estates that\r\noften are uncultivated for want of capital and making them productive\r\nthrough the encouragement of small capitalists or farmers.\r\n\r\nThe general system of highways and cart roads as well as of the\r\nrailroads has been devised for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWith regard to colonization and immigration the policy of securing the\r\nbenefit of the favored soil to settlers has been indicated in the\r\ncorrespondence with various companies and individuals. In a report by\r\nthe Director of Agriculture he declared that immigration from North\r\nAmerica would be very pleasing to Guatemala and would strengthen the\r\ncordial relations existing between the two countries. That the\r\nimmigrants will be well received he was assured. Their practical\r\ncharacter would be especially valuable in developing the resources of\r\nthe country. The Director, however, called attention to the fact that in\r\nmany places of the country the geological conditions were not similar to\r\nthe prairies of the United States where in the beginning very much could\r\nbe accomplished on a large scale by machinery. In many of the districts\r\nopen to settlement in Guatemala much of the work of clearing would have\r\nto be done by hand. That is one reason why encouragement is given to the\r\nindividual settlers instead of to companies.\r\n\r\nTo broaden and strengthen the present immigration law the Department of\r\nAgriculture has recommended that certain lands be thrown open to\r\nsettlement on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. The government shall make the plan for the colony dividing the lands\r\ninto lots of one caballeria (112 acres).\r\n\r\n2. The settler shall take immediate possession of the lot which is\r\ngranted him.\r\n\r\n3. The government shall aid the removal of the colonists from their\r\npresent place of residence to the point where they intend to settle.\r\nThis aid to be extended under conditions which will insure its\r\nrepayment.\r\n\r\n4. The colonists on taking possession of their land shall obligate\r\nthemselves to begin cultivating some of the following articles: rice,\r\ncorn, beans, coffee, cacao, vanilla, rubber, cotton, hemp, etc.\r\n\r\n5. The government shall designate from among the colonists some one who\r\nshall give general instruction with regard to the farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriendly relations with all countries, both neighboring and distant, is\r\na leading point in President Estrada Cabrera's programme. The relations\r\nof Guatemala with the United States are particularly close and cordial.\r\n\r\nIn his annual message President Estrada Cabrera said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"It is well known that the grand Republic of North America always\r\n     has shown the most sympathetic regard for our country and the\r\n     earnest effort of my government has been to strengthen the ties of\r\n     friendship which unite the two nations. With this feeling existing\r\n     there has been achieved during the period since 1898 the most\r\n     flattering results, so that it can be confidently stated that never\r\n     before have the relations between Guatemala and the United States\r\n     reached so great a degree of cordiality as to-day, and it may be\r\n     said that never has any cause of discord between the two\r\n     governments been so remote as now. The death of the illustrious\r\n     President McKinley, which was felt so deeply in Guatemala, and the\r\n     advent into the Presidency of Mr. Roosevelt in no way interrupted\r\n     the progress of affairs with our Republic and those which were\r\n     pending followed their tranquil course towards a satisfactory\r\n     arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of Foreign Relations in his annual report said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Motives analogous to those which in foreign governments have\r\n     caused congratulation over the re-election of Senor Estrada Cabrera\r\n     as President of Guatemala have made it pleasing that the government\r\n     of this Republic on its part could extend its congratulations over\r\n     the re-election in the United States and Mexico respectively of\r\n     Messrs. Roosevelt and Diaz, two eminent statesmen whose\r\n     conciliatory policies are well known, as likewise their sympathetic\r\n     regard for Guatemala. The continuation of these illustrious\r\n     personages in power is considered by this government as a guaranty\r\n     of the increasing cordiality of the relations of Guatemala with\r\n     them and it has also enabled at the same time to be placed in\r\n     evidence with all sincerity the satisfaction which has been\r\n     produced by their re-election in their respective countries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are correct statements, for the sentiment of profound sympathy and\r\nadmiration which President Estrada Cabrera and the whole people of\r\nGuatemala entertain for President Roosevelt and for the American people\r\nare very marked. For President Roosevelt on account of his grand traits\r\nof character, of mentality and of heart and the spirit of humanity,\r\njustice and rectitude which make of him the chief magistrate most\r\nconspicuous, most respected, most popular and most cherished of the\r\npresent day; and for the American people on account of their\r\nintelligence, their enterprising disposition and their unceasing labors\r\nfor progress, which have gained for them so pre-eminent a place among\r\nall the nations of the earth as one of the grandest, most nourishing and\r\nmost powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\nADHERENCE TO THE HAGUE PEACE PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nThese quotations indicate the sentiment of Guatemala towards the two\r\ncountries with which geographically and otherwise it is most closely\r\nallied. Further evidence of the friendship for the United States and of\r\nthe desire to sustain its policies of international peace were afforded\r\nin the promptness with which President Roosevelt's suggestion of a\r\nsecond Peace Conference in The Hague was accepted. With regard to the\r\nUnited States the Secretary of Foreign Affairs stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Knowing the importance of our relations with the great American\r\n     nation it was a grateful duty to send a special mission to\r\n     Washington with the sole object of congratulating President\r\n     Roosevelt. For the discharge of this function Senor Jorge Munoz was\r\n     selected and he discharged it with entire satisfaction to the\r\n     government. This mission having been disposed of he was accredited\r\n     permanently as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary.\r\n\r\n     \"Inasmuch as it was not one of the ancient nations of Europe, but a\r\n     young and virile Republic, the strongest in America, which launched\r\n     the project through its distinguished President of a second Hague\r\n     Conference to perfect and complete the works of the first one in\r\n     favor of universal peace, it is to be hoped that this effort will\r\n     be seconded by all the countries of the civilized world and that at\r\n     no distant time when experience shall have shown the deficiencies\r\n     in the conclusions adopted by previous Congresses those which may\r\n     be adopted in the coming Peace Conference will be more efficacious\r\n     for the success of the humanitarian and praiseworthy end which the\r\n     United States proposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGuatemala previously had given its adhesion to the principles of\r\narbitration promulgated under The Hague Convention. It was represented\r\nin the Second International American Conference held in Mexico\r\n1901-1902, and the various treaties and recommendations made by that\r\nConference were ratified or endorsed as in the case of the other\r\nsignatory governments. The action taken by the government of Guatemala\r\non the respective conventions and recommendations was officially\r\ntransmitted to Senor Mariscal, Secretary of Foreign Relations of Mexico,\r\nin accordance with the resolution of the Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECUNIARY CLAIMS ARBITRATION.\r\n\r\nAmong the treaties promulgated by the Pan-American Conference in Mexico\r\nwas one relating to pecuniary claims. This required the ratification of\r\nfive governments in order to make it effective. Guatemala was one of the\r\nfirst to give its formal adhesion to this convention. This treaty was\r\nratified by the United States Senate and promulgated by the Department\r\nof State from Washington in the spring of 1905, so that United States\r\ncitizens can now claim its benefits. The treaty consists of five\r\narticles. Under its terms the high contracting parties agree to submit\r\nto arbitration, through the Hague Court, all claims for pecuniary loss\r\nor damage which may be presented by their respective citizens and which\r\ncannot be amicably adjusted through diplomatic channels and when such\r\nclaims are of sufficient importance to warrant the expenses of\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of Article 26 of the convention of The Hague the high\r\ncontracting parties agree to submit to the decision of the Permanent\r\nCourt of Arbitration established by that convention all controversies\r\nwhich are the subject-matter of the Treaty unless both parties should\r\nprefer that especial jurisdiction be organized according to Article 21.\r\n\r\nIf for any cause the Permanent Court of The Hague should not be opened\r\nto one or more of the high contracting parties they obligate themselves\r\nto stipulate in a special treaty the rules under which the tribunal\r\nshall be established as well as its forms of procedure.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the administration of President Estrada Cabrera negotiated and\r\nthe National Assembly ratified an agreement with Germany, Belgium,\r\nFrance, England, and Italy, which disposed of many subjects that had\r\nbeen in controversy.\r\n\r\nSpain, the United States and Mexico did not enter into the agreement\r\nbecause those governments preferred to postpone the claims of their\r\ncitizens until the industrial crisis was over and the financial\r\nconditions were improved. Since that time a number of claims have been\r\nadjusted satisfactorily. President Estrada Cabrera stated in a recent\r\nmessage that there were no claims at the present time which were\r\nweighing upon the national treasury. These matters having been arranged\r\nsatisfactorily he said that no subject had arisen which could alter the\r\nfriendly relations with the countries of Europe. This friendship was\r\nshown in the tribute paid by the Diplomatic Corps on New Year's day.\r\nSubsequently the governments of Germany and France had shown especial\r\nconsideration by conferring on the President the Order of the Red Eagle\r\nand of the Legion of Honor respectively.\r\n\r\nWith Mexico the relations of Guatemala have been cordial since the\r\nboundary dispute was settled in 1895. Recently the commercial relations,\r\non account of the construction of the Pan-American Railway through\r\nMexican territory to the Guatemalan border have required the\r\nestablishment of various consulates in important places in Mexico, and\r\nthe exequaturs have been granted by the Mexican government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAZA OF JOCOTENANGO, GUATEMALA CITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCORD IN CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the neighboring republics of Central America the\r\nattitude of Guatemala has been open and pronounced. It desires to\r\ndestroy every cause of discord among the Republics and to maintain a\r\nperfect equilibrium. Guatemala took part in the conference which was\r\nheld at Corinto, Nicaragua, in August, 1904, and at which Salvador,\r\nHonduras and Nicaragua also were represented. Through its delegate\r\nPresident Estrada Cabrera's government subscribed to the following\r\ndeclarations:\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. To maintain peace is the principal objective of our government,\r\n     not only because it is a necessity for the various peoples, but\r\n     also because it imposes itself as a duty which all Spanish American\r\n     nationalities should fulfil. For this reason we firmly believe in\r\n     the proposition to overcome in Central America every obstacle that\r\n     may stand in the way of peace and we will put forth our strongest\r\n     efforts to frustrate the schemes of those who seek to sow distrust\r\n     and jealousy among us impelled as they are by the spirit of\r\n     ambition or disorder.\r\n\r\n     2. The strict compliance with the international compacts which bind\r\n     us shall be the test to which we submit our acts so that every\r\n     effort to the contrary will be vain and barren since it is\r\n     necessary to recognize that the generality of the labors of the\r\n     enemies of each administration tend to no laudable ends but rather\r\n     are the work of selfish egotists, of personal enmities or the\r\n     aberration of unbalanced judgment.\r\n\r\n     3. We do not hesitate then in declaring that whatever scheme of\r\n     discord, subversive attempt, or suggestion which proposes to break\r\n     our loyal friendship shall receive no support among us because the\r\n     sincerity and firmness of our relations as representatives of the\r\n     peoples whom we serve are and always will be affirmed in this\r\n     solemn agreement, which we make at the instance of Central America;\r\n     an agreement which is the fruit of the efforts we have made as\r\n     public men on different occasions.\r\n\r\n     4. We expect that all good citizens will give us in the sense\r\n     indicated their patriotic co-operation inspired in ideals of peace\r\n     and fraternity and contributing by supporting us in this accord to\r\n     place an end to the discord which the enemies of the public\r\n     tranquillity cause. And also upholding the liberal and progressive\r\n     policy which governs our acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF TRAVEL AND HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuatemala is a fascinating country for the traveler and visitor.\r\nAntiquarians, deep delvers in the majestic monuments of the long\r\nforgotten past, seek in the myths, the traditions, the temples and the\r\nruins the riddles of prehistoric civilization. Modern tourists traveling\r\nas they will be able to do within a short time by railway from New York\r\nor San Francisco to the very heart of Guatemala may lose themselves in\r\nadmiration of the sublime scenery, the lovely landscapes of valley and\r\nmountain lake and forest (the Indian name for Guatemala means abounding\r\nin trees), volcanic caps, giant outlines, and cloud-clad craters.\r\nEverywhere they will encounter that diversity which is the chief\r\nattraction of natural scenery. They will find also superimposed on the\r\nprehistoric Indian civilization the charm of Spanish architecture,\r\ncustoms, character and institutions.\r\n\r\nMen of the stamp of President Estrada Cabrera who are engaged in the\r\nmaterial upbuilding and the political progress of the country may prefer\r\nto talk of its agriculture and commerce, its opportunities for the\r\nenergetic and resourceful people of the northern regions rather than to\r\ndiscuss its picturesque ruins audits fascinating history. Yet they would\r\nnot have these subjects neglected. Hence the traveler and the tourist\r\nalways are welcome, and whether they be deeply learned scientific\r\ninvestigators or mere birds of passage seeking novelty every provision\r\nis made to aid them in their travels.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S BOLD HAND.\r\n\r\nIn the very accurate and complete physiographic description of Guatemala\r\ncontained in the report of the Intercontinental Railway Survey the\r\nfollowing description is given of the great chain of volcanic cones and\r\npeaks which add so greatly to the bold picturesqueness of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The Pacific coast extends generally from the northwest to the\r\n     southeast. From the sea the ground rises with a very gentle slope\r\n     inland for almost 25 or 30 miles when the country becomes broken by\r\n     the lava foothills of the volcanoes which extend from one end of\r\n     the country to the other and which stand like a giant wall between\r\n     the coast and the interior. Beginning at the Mexican boundary the\r\n     line of volcanoes extends nearly parallel to the coast. Back of\r\n     this is a plateau limited on the other side by the Continental\r\n     Divide and much broken by spurs which unite the volcanoes with the\r\n     Divide and the deep valleys between the spurs. The plateau is\r\n     drained by rivers which run to the sea through the deep canyons\r\n     between the volcanoes. The Continental Divide begins with the\r\n     volcano Tacana and making a semicircular bend to the north and east\r\n     rises again in the volcano Tajumulco. From this point its general\r\n     direction is easterly as far as the Cerro Tecpam. Tacana and\r\n     Tajumulco are the highest points on this are being respectively\r\n     13,334 and 13,814 feet above sea level. From Tajumulco to near\r\n     Totonicapam the general altitude of the Divide is about 9,000 feet,\r\n     the most prominent peaks being the Cerro Cerchil 11,830 feet, and\r\n     the Cerro Calel 10,813 feet. From Totonicapam to Cerro Tecpam the\r\n     general elevation of the Divide is about 10,500 feet with one peak,\r\n     the Cerro Quiche of 11,160 feet. From Cerro Tecpam 10,050 feet, the\r\n     Divide turns to the southeast and drops to a general elevation of\r\n     about 7,000 feet, crossing the plateau and rising again in the\r\n     Cerro Santa Maria Cauque. Following the hills of Mexico, it crosses\r\n     the plain near Guatemala City, the suburb of Guarda Viejo, 5,060\r\n     feet, being on the Divide.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heights of other principal volcanoes are given opposite:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Acatenango            13,012\r\n     Fuego                 12,821\r\n     Agua                  12,300\r\n     Atitlan               11,849\r\n     Santa Maria           10,535\r\n     Quezaltenango          9,358\r\n     Pacaya                 7,675\r\n     Ipala                  6,801\r\n     Chingo                 6,019\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETY IN GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.\r\n\r\nIn the geological structure of the country unusual variety of character\r\nis shown. The quarternary formation, aluvium and diluvium, covers the\r\ngreater portion of the Pacific coast from the foot of the mountains to\r\nthe sea. The same formation is also observed in the neighborhood of\r\nGuatemala City, the valley of the Passion River, Puerto Barrios and\r\nvarious other localities on the Atlantic Slope.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary formation and particularly limestone covers the entire\r\nDepartment of Peten. Furthermore, limestones and dolomites of the upper\r\ncretaceous age are noted from La Libertad toward the Usumacinta River\r\nand toward British Honduras. In the localities of San Luis and Santa\r\nBarbara there are tertiary limestones and sandstones of Eocene and\r\nmiocene ages.\r\n\r\nThe limestones and dolomites of the upper cretaceous age are also found\r\nin various localities mixed with tertiary limestone and sandstone as\r\nwell as conglomerates, dolomites, and limestones of the lower cretaceous\r\nage. In other sections they are mixed with limestones and dolomites of\r\nthe upper carboniferous age mingled with slate, sandstone and pudding\r\nstone. The latter formation is found in other sections with\r\nprecarboniferous limestone and also with crystalline limestone of the\r\nazoic age.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary formation is followed by an azoic formation of gneiss, mica\r\nslate, and phylada with large intrusions of granite. A kind of\r\nhorn-blend slate has been observed in some parts of Izabal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDSCAPE OF GUASTOTOYA RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe eruptive formations are composed of porphyry in the north and\r\nnorthwest; of diorite, obsidian, rhyolite, and dacite and of trachyte,\r\ntogether with basalt, rhyolite, obsidian and granite in other sections.\r\nThe eruptive formations are further composed of basalt in Pacaya and\r\nseveral other volcanoes; and mostly of ambesite in the rest of the\r\nCordilleras and the highlands.\r\n\r\nFor the present-day traveler who is interested in earthquakes and their\r\neffects and in the ruins of Spanish architecture, nothing more\r\nentertaining can be found than a visit to La Antigua, which can be\r\nreached from Guatemala City by a few hours' ride in carriage or on\r\nhorseback. Antigua stretches through the beautiful and fertile valley\r\nwhich in the Indian language means dry lake because the tradition exists\r\nthat in prehistoric times there was a fine sheet of water covering the\r\nland. The panorama which delights the eye from any elevated point of\r\nAntigua is glorious. The three volcanoes of Acatenango, Agua (water) and\r\nFuego (fire) lose their majestic combs in the clouds. In every direction\r\nspread fertile fields with an infinite number of coffee and sugar\r\nplantations in every state of production. The borders of the city are\r\nbathed by two charming rivers, the Pensativo and the Portal. In the\r\nimmediate neighborhood are hygienic baths of pure crystalline water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREHISTORIC RUINS AND FAMED LAKE ATITLAN.\r\n\r\nMany volumes have been written about the prehistoric ruins of Guatemala\r\nand especially of Copan. One of the most recent and most sumptuously\r\nillustrated is that by Anne Cary Maudslay and Alfred Percival Maudslay\r\nentitled \"A Glimpse at Guatemala.\" It was published in London. In this\r\nbook Professor Maudslay gives the following description of a visit to\r\nthe ruins at Quirigua:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The ruins, which are completely hidden in a thick tropical forest,\r\n     stand about three-quarters of a mile from the left bank of the\r\n     river Motagua and about five miles from the miserable little\r\n     village of Quirigua, from which they take their name. They consist\r\n     of numerous square or oblong mounds and terraces varying from six\r\n     to forty feet in height, some standing by themselves, others\r\n     clustered in irregular groups. Most of these mounds were faced with\r\n     worked stone and were ascended by flights of stone steps.\r\n\r\n     \"The interest centers in the thirteen large carved monoliths which\r\n     are arranged irregularly round what were probably the most\r\n     important plazas. Six of these monuments are tall stones measuring\r\n     three to five feet square and standing fourteen to twenty feet out\r\n     of the ground. The other five are oblong or rounded blocks of stone\r\n     shaped so as to represent huge turtles or armadilloes or some such\r\n     animals. All these monuments are covered with elaborate carving.\r\n     Usually on both back and front of the tall monoliths there is\r\n     carved a huge human figure standing full face and in a stiff and\r\n     conventional attitude. The sides of the monuments are covered with\r\n     tables of hieroglyphs, most of them in fairly good preservation. In\r\n     addition to these tables of hieroglyphs there are series of square\r\n     or cartouches of what appears to be actual picture writing, each\r\n     division measuring about eighteen inches square and containing\r\n     usually two or three grotesque figures of men and animals. The\r\n     design of these picture writings shows considerable variety and\r\n     freedom of treatment as compared with that of the large sizes human\r\n     figures in the execution of which the artist seems to have been\r\n     bound by conventional rules.\r\n\r\n     \"The largest of the stone animals is perhaps the most remarkable of\r\n     all the monuments. Its measurement is roughly a cube of eight feet,\r\n     it must weigh nearly twenty tons and it rests on three large slabs\r\n     of stone. It is shaped like a turtle and is covered with a most\r\n     elaborate and curious ornament and with tables of hieroglyphics and\r\n     cartouches of picture writing. The greater part of the ornament\r\n     throughout these carvings is formed from the grotesque\r\n     representations of the human face or the faces of animals, the\r\n     features frequently so greatly exaggerated that it is most\r\n     difficult to recognize them, but a careful examination enables one\r\n     almost invariably to trace back to this facial origin what at\r\n     first sight appears to be merely conventional scroll work. Forms\r\n     derived from leaves or flowers are altogether absent; occasional\r\n     use is made of a plaited ribbon and a very free use of plumes of\r\n     feathers which are oftenmost gracefully arranged and beautifully\r\n     carved. The fifteen monuments are divided into two groups; in one\r\n     the figures are all those of men, in the other of women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same authors give the following vivid description of the famed Lake\r\nAtitlan:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Our tent was pitched so close to the precipice that even from my\r\n     bed I had a grand view into the Lake and could watch the black\r\n     masses of the volcanoes looming clear-cut and solemn in the\r\n     moonlight or changing from black to gray in the early dawn; then a\r\n     rosy flush would touch the peak of Atitlan and the light creep down\r\n     its side, revealing for a brief half hour every detail of cinder\r\n     ridge and chasm on its scarred and wounded slopes until with a\r\n     sudden burst of glory the sun rose above the eastern hills to\r\n     strike the mirror-like surface of the Lake and flood the world with\r\n     warmth and dazzling light. Every peak and mountain ridge now stood\r\n     out clear and sharp against the morning sky, and only in the shadow\r\n     of the hills would a fleecy mist hang over the surface of the lake\r\n     far beneath us; then almost before the sun had power to drink up\r\n     these lees of the night from the deep gap between the hills to the\r\n     south, a linger of white cloud, borne up from the seaward slope,\r\n     would creep around the peak of Atitlan only to be dissipated in the\r\n     cooler air; but finger followed finger and the mysterious hand\r\n     never lost its grasp until about noon great billowy clouds rolled\r\n     up through the gap and the outpost was fairly captured although the\r\n     crater itself often stood out clear above the cloudy belt. It was\r\n     not, however, until the sun began to lose its power that the real\r\n     attack commenced and the second column deployed through the gap on\r\n     the southern flank of San Pedro and then from five o'clock until\r\n     dark there followed a scene which no pen and no brush could\r\n     adequately portray. The clouds seemed to be bewitched; they came\r\n     down on us in alternate black and sunlit masses, terrible in their\r\n     majesty; then rolled aside to show us all the beauty of a sunset\r\n     sky, tints of violet that shaded into pink, and pink that melted\r\n     into the clearest blue, whilst far away beyond the mountain seaward\r\n     rolled vast billowy masses, first red and yellow and then pink\r\n     fading to the softest green. Again and again would the clouds roll\r\n     down upon us, the mist at times so thick that we could not see\r\n     beyond a hundred yards; then just as quickly it would roll away and\r\n     reveal a completely new phase of this ever shifting scene of\r\n     beauty. As the sun sank behind San Pedro all turned again to dark\r\n     and angry purple with contrasts and reflections like the sheen of a\r\n     shot silk. Slowly the mists melted away with the fading daylight,\r\n     Venus hung for a while like a splendid jewel in the air and the\r\n     mountains turned again to shadowy masses outlined against a crystal\r\n     sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCINATING HISTORY THROUGH THE CENTURIES.\r\n\r\nHistorically every period of Guatemala is fascinating. Usually the\r\nhistory of the country is divided into the epochs of the aborigines, the\r\nSpanish Conquest, Independence, and the era of liberal governments.\r\n\r\nAcross the centuries the path of history can be traced. A book written\r\nin the 16th century by one of the aborigines of the time of the Conquest\r\nand called \"Popol-Vuh\" or \"Book of the People,\" speaks of the Quiches,\r\nvigorous and hardy natives of the soil, forerunners of the Guatemalan\r\npeople as having reached at that time a degree of advance which singled\r\nthem out from among the other primitive inhabitants of America. Their\r\nreligious system was in essence a kind of animal worship whose gods were\r\npersonified by the fox, the coyote, and the wild boar to be soon\r\nreemployed through natural evolution by the forces of nature such as the\r\nheavens, the earth, and the sea. They left as evidences of their worship\r\nthe multitude of monuments whose imposing ruins are preserved today.\r\nPyramids which seem to bear traces of Egypt and characters indicative\r\nof a remote Asiatic origin; temples, such as the Temple of the Sun, of\r\ngrand architecture; and the Palace, dwelling of the King, a holy being\r\nand the Supreme Arbiter. The latter is among the most notable of\r\nAmerican antiquities and it causes admiration through the graduated\r\npyramid, the triangular vault and the arch forming an harmonious whole.\r\nThe Quiche civilization was an advanced one and its government was a\r\ntheocracy in which the High Priest was both the Supreme Governor and\r\ninherited the name of the primitive god Votan. This theocracy was drawn\r\nfrom among the warriors while the people in complete servitude tilled\r\nthe fields in order to sustain the worship and raise grand monuments and\r\nbuilt numerous cities on the borders of the lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nAgriculture was well advanced. Cacao was cultivated with grand\r\nceremonies and maize or Indian corn which was guarded with profound\r\nveneration because according to the ancient tradition man was formed\r\nfrom it. Cotton was also grown and brilliant garments woven from it\r\nwhich were dyed with cochineal and pigments formed from various plants.\r\nTobacco was cultivated and yucca, beans, potatoes, etc. Various textiles\r\nwere fabricated of the finest quality and many of the palaces and\r\ntemples were hung with this tapestry.\r\n\r\nCeramics and various kinds of pottery were manufactured both for use and\r\nfor ornament. The sciences and the arts were developed. The fame of the\r\nQuiche calendar exists today. The aborigines also understood painting,\r\nsculpture, and music. They made plumes and cloaks from the feathers of\r\nthe birds and they wrote upon a paper prepared from the Amatl. Their\r\nlanguage was liquid and possessed few inflections. It was the most\r\nperfect of the six hundred or more languages which the Spaniards\r\nencountered in the Isthmus of Central America. They had a literature of\r\ntheir own and from this fragments have been preserved notably the drama\r\n\"Rabinal Achi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH CONQUEST AND WHAT CAME AFTER.\r\n\r\nGuatemala was conquered by the Lieutenant of Cortez, Pedro de Alvarado.\r\nIn April, 1524, he crowned his series of victories over the Quiches by\r\nrouting them on the plains of Urbina, capturing and condemning to perish\r\nby hanging the two last Kings of the most powerful monarchy of Central\r\nAmerica; Oxib-Queh and Beleheb-Tzy. In July of the same year he founded\r\nthe city of Guatemala, although this was not definitely established\r\nuntil November, 1527.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years all the regions of Central America had submitted to\r\nthe Spanish Crown and formed the Kingdom of Guatemala, to the capital of\r\nwhich was transferred in 1549 the Royal Audiencia or High Court.\r\nGuatemala was the head of Spanish power in Central America under the\r\ngeneral term of the Spanish Captain Generalcy for two centuries.\r\n\r\nDuring the two hundred and fifty years following the Conquest the\r\ncountry had three capitals in turn, all named Guatemala City. The first,\r\nfounded by Alvarado, was on the very spot where he fought the battle\r\nwhich made him conqueror. The Indian kings of the South having heard of\r\nthe exploits of Cortez in Mexico, sent an embassy to him which he\r\nreceived with distinction. He sent his favorite Lieutenant Alvarado back\r\nto take possession. Alvarado and his three hundred Spanish soldiers were\r\nnearly a year in making the journey through the forest. When the Indians\r\nopposed him he gave continuous battle and finally conquered. He\r\ndestroyed their capital, razed the temple of their idols to the ground,\r\nand built on its site a church.\r\n\r\nFor seventeen years Alvarado kept the Indians at work building a new\r\ncapital on the site of their old one. Then came the earthquake which\r\ndestroyed the place and buried nine-tenths of the inhabitants under the\r\nruins. A new location was found, but again, in 1773, by the eruption of\r\nSanta Maria the capital was destroyed. This is the group of picturesque\r\nruins now known as La Antigua. With the destruction of this capital a\r\nthird and final movement to the splendid situation in the Hermit Valley\r\nwas made and the new capital which is the Guatemala City of today was\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAfter years of struggle against the Spanish domination, beginning in\r\n1811, Guatemala secured its independence, which was proclaimed September\r\n15, 1821, when in place of the Kingdom of Guatemala there was\r\nestablished \"A nation free and independent of every other nation.\" The\r\nhistory of subsequent years is interwoven with the events of other\r\nCentral American countries. After many evolutions and disorders as well\r\nas revolutionary changes of government, the era known as the period of\r\nreform and the re-establishment of the liberties of the country began in\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTERS OF RECENT HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe events which led to the adoption of the liberal Constitution of\r\n1879, which is today in force, do not need to be recounted here. General\r\nJusto Rufino Barrios, who had been the leading spirit in the Liberal\r\nrevolution, was a pronounced advocate of the union of all the Central\r\nAmerican States in a single federal republic. He endeavored to\r\naccomplish this against the opposition of Salvador and was killed at the\r\nbattle of Chalchuapa in 1885. He was succeeded by General Manuel\r\nLisandro Barillas, who exercised the government from 1887 to 1892. After\r\nhim came General Jose Maria Reyna Barrios, who during the first four\r\nyears of his administration gave a good government and worked much for\r\nthe prosperity of his country. In the last two years, however, through\r\nthe bad counsels of selfish advisers foreign to his government he sought\r\nto extend the term of his authority and was resisted by successive\r\nrevolutions. He was assassinated by a personal enemy of European\r\nnationality in February, 1898, and Guatemala was then left in the midst\r\nof a most disastrous condition, both industrial and political.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Manuel Estrada Cabrera, the lawyer, came into\r\npower and began the series of administrative reforms and measures for\r\nthe material development of the country which have so vastly improved\r\nthe condition of the people, have re-established credit and given\r\nassurance of further progress under continuous peace and tranquillity.\r\nIt is these beneficial measures which have caused President Estrada\r\nCabrera to be signalized as the chief of the modern emancipation of\r\nGuatemala in its policies, in its intellectual and moral advancement,\r\nand as the author of its present progress. Under his government order in\r\nadministration has been secured, respect for the rights of all, material\r\ndevelopment in countless forms, the general improvement of the people\r\nand the most perfect harmony and equity in international relations have\r\nbeen obtained. It is the success of these policies, which is now\r\nassured, that makes Guatemala so clearly the country of the future and\r\nentitles Estrada Cabrera to rank with the most distinguished heads of\r\nState of the present day.",
