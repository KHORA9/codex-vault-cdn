The upper fall is\r\n     about 1600 feet, and the lower about 400 feet.

The flock of sheep here photographed were\r\n     feeding near Alger Lake on the slope of Blacktop Mountain, at an\r\n     altitude of about 10,000 feet and just beyond the eastern boundary\r\n     of the Park.\r\n\r\n     _From a photograph by Herbert W.

It was estimated to be about 250 feet\r\n     high.

The spring begins with the first rainstorm,\r\nwhich usually falls in November. In a few months the wonderful flowery\r\nvegetation is in full bloom, and by the end of May it is dead and dry\r\nand crisp, as if every plant had been roasted in an oven.\r\n\r\nThen the lolling, panting flocks and herds are driven to the high, cool,\r\ngreen pastures of the Sierra. I was longing for the mountains about this\r\ntime, but money was scarce and I couldn’t see how a bread supply was to\r\nbe kept up. While I was anxiously brooding on the bread problem, so\r\ntroublesome to wanderers, and trying to believe that I might learn to\r\nlive like the wild animals, gleaning nourishment here and there from\r\nseeds, berries, etc., sauntering and climbing in joyful independence of\r\nmoney or baggage, Mr. Delaney, a sheep-owner, for whom I had worked a\r\nfew weeks, called on me, and offered to engage me to go with his\r\nshepherd and flock to the headwaters of the Merced and Tuolumne\r\nrivers—the very region I had most in mind. I was in the mood to accept\r\nwork of any kind that would take me into the mountains whose treasures I\r\nhad tasted last summer in the Yosemite region. The flock, he explained,\r\nwould be moved gradually higher through the successive forest belts as\r\nthe snow melted, stopping for a few weeks at the best places we came to.\r\nThese I thought would be good centers of observation from which I might\r\nbe able to make many telling excursions within a radius of eight or ten\r\nmiles of the camps to learn something of the plants, animals, and rocks;\r\nfor he assured me that I should be left perfectly free to follow my\r\nstudies. I judged, however, that I was in no way the right man for the\r\nplace, and freely explained my shortcomings, confessing that I was\r\nwholly unacquainted with the topography of the upper mountains, the\r\nstreams that would have to be crossed, and the wild sheep-eating\r\nanimals, etc.; in short that, what with bears, coyotes, rivers, cañons,\r\nand thorny, bewildering chaparral, I feared that half or more of his\r\nflock would be lost. Fortunately these shortcomings seemed\r\ninsignificant to Mr. Delaney. The main thing, he said, was to have a man\r\nabout the camp whom he could trust to see that the shepherd did his\r\nduty, and he assured me that the difficulties that seemed so formidable\r\nat a distance would vanish as we went on; encouraging me further by\r\nsaying that the shepherd would do all the herding, that I could study\r\nplants and rocks and scenery as much as I liked, and that he would\r\nhimself accompany us to the first main camp and make occasional visits\r\nto our higher ones to replenish our store of provisions and see how we\r\nprospered. Therefore I concluded to go, though still fearing, when I saw\r\nthe silly sheep bouncing one by one through the narrow gate of the home\r\ncorral to be counted, that of the two thousand and fifty many would\r\nnever return.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in getting a fine St. Bernard dog for a companion. His\r\nmaster, a hunter with whom I was slightly acquainted, came to me as soon\r\nas he heard that I was going to spend the summer in the Sierra and\r\nbegged me to take his favorite dog, Carlo, with me, for he feared that\r\nif he were compelled to stay all summer on the plains the fierce heat\r\nmight be the death of him. “I think I can trust you to be kind to him,”\r\nhe said, “and I am sure he will be good to you. He knows all about the\r\nmountain animals, will guard the camp, assist in managing the sheep,\r\nand in every way be found able and faithful.” Carlo knew we were talking\r\nabout him, watched our faces, and listened so attentively that I fancied\r\nhe understood us. Calling him by name, I asked him if he was willing to\r\ngo with me. He looked me in the face with eyes expressing wonderful\r\nintelligence, then turned to his master, and after permission was given\r\nby a wave of the hand toward me and a farewell patting caress, he\r\nquietly followed me as if he perfectly understood all that had been said\r\nand had known me always.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_June 3, 1869._ This morning provisions, camp-kettles, blankets,\r\nplant-press, etc., were packed on two horses, the flock headed for the\r\ntawny foothills, and away we sauntered in a cloud of dust: Mr. Delaney,\r\nbony and tall, with sharply hacked profile like Don Quixote, leading the\r\npack-horses, Billy, the proud shepherd, a Chinaman and a Digger Indian\r\nto assist in driving for the first few days in the brushy foothills, and\r\nmyself with notebook tied to my belt.\r\n\r\nThe home ranch from which we set out is on the south side of the\r\nTuolumne River near French Bar, where the foothills of metamorphic\r\ngold-bearing slates dip below the stratified deposits of the Central\r\nValley. We had not gone more than a mile before some of the old leaders\r\nof the flock showed by the eager, inquiring way they ran and looked\r\nahead that they were thinking of the high pastures they had enjoyed last\r\nsummer. Soon the whole flock seemed to be hopefully excited, the mothers\r\ncalling their lambs, the lambs replying in tones wonderfully human,\r\ntheir fondly quavering calls interrupted now and then by hastily\r\nsnatched mouthfuls of withered grass. Amid all this seeming babel of\r\nbaas as they streamed over the hills every mother and child recognized\r\neach other’s voice. In case a tired lamb, half asleep in the smothering\r\ndust, should fail to answer, its mother would come running back through\r\nthe flock toward the spot whence its last response was heard, and\r\nrefused to be comforted until she found it, the one of a thousand,\r\nthough to our eyes and ears all seemed alike.\r\n\r\nThe flock traveled at the rate of about a mile an hour, outspread in the\r\nform of an irregular triangle, about a hundred yards wide at the base,\r\nand a hundred and fifty yards long, with a crooked, ever-changing point\r\nmade up of the strongest foragers, called the “leaders,” which, with the\r\nmost active of those scattered along the ragged sides of the “main\r\nbody,” hastily explored nooks in the rocks and bushes for grass and\r\nleaves; the lambs and feeble old mothers dawdling in the rear were\r\ncalled the “tail end.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sheep in the Mountains_]\r\n\r\nAbout noon the heat was hard to bear; the poor sheep panted pitifully\r\nand tried to stop in the shade of every tree they came to, while we\r\ngazed with eager longing through the dim burning glare toward the snowy\r\nmountains and streams, though not one was in sight. The landscape is\r\nonly wavering foothills roughened here and there with bushes and trees\r\nand outcropping masses of slate. The trees, mostly the blue oak\r\n(_Quercus Douglasii_), are about thirty to forty feet high, with pale\r\nblue-green leaves and white bark, sparsely planted on the thinnest soil\r\nor in crevices of rocks beyond the reach of grass fires. The slates in\r\nmany places rise abruptly through the tawny grass in sharp\r\nlichen-covered slabs like tombstones in deserted burying-grounds. With\r\nthe exception of the oak and four or five species of manzanita and\r\nceanothus, the vegetation of the foothills is mostly the same as that of\r\nthe plains. I saw this region in the early spring, when it was a\r\ncharming landscape garden full of birds and bees and flowers. Now the\r\nscorching weather makes everything dreary. The ground is full of cracks,\r\nlizards glide about on the rocks, and ants in amazing numbers, whose\r\ntiny sparks of life only burn the brighter with the heat, fairly\r\nquiver with unquenchable energy as they run in long lines to fight and\r\ngather food. How it comes that they do not dry to a crisp in a few\r\nseconds’ exposure to such sun-fire is marvelous. A few rattlesnakes lie\r\ncoiled in out-of-the-way places, but are seldom seen. Magpies and crows,\r\nusually so noisy, are silent now, standing in mixed flocks on the ground\r\nbeneath the best shade trees, with bills wide open and wings drooped,\r\ntoo breathless to speak; the quails also are trying to keep in the shade\r\nabout the few tepid alkaline water-holes; cottontail rabbits are running\r\nfrom shade to shade among the ceanothus brush, and occasionally the\r\nlong-eared hare is seen cantering gracefully across the wider openings.\r\n\r\nAfter a short noon rest in a grove, the poor dust-choked flock was again\r\ndriven ahead over the brushy hills, but the dim roadway we had been\r\nfollowing faded away just where it was most needed, compelling us to\r\nstop to look about us and get our bearings. The Chinaman seemed to think\r\nwe were lost, and chattered in pidgin English concerning the abundance\r\nof “litty stick” (chaparral), while the Indian silently scanned the\r\nbillowy ridges and gulches for openings. Pushing through the thorny\r\njungle, we at length discovered a road trending toward Coulterville,\r\nwhich we followed until an hour before sunset, when we reached a dry\r\nranch and camped for the night.\r\n\r\nCamping in the foothills with a flock of sheep is simple and easy, but\r\nfar from pleasant. The sheep were allowed to pick what they could find\r\nin the neighborhood until after sunset, watched by the shepherd, while\r\nthe others gathered wood, made a fire, cooked, unpacked and fed the\r\nhorses, etc. About dusk the weary sheep were gathered on the highest\r\nopen spot near camp, where they willingly bunched close together, and\r\nafter each mother had found her lamb and suckled it, all lay down and\r\nrequired no attention until morning.\r\n\r\nSupper was announced by the call, “Grub!” Each with a tin plate helped\r\nhimself direct from the pots and pans while chatting about such camp\r\nstudies as sheep-feed, mines, coyotes, bears, or adventures during the\r\nmemorable gold days of pay dirt. The Indian kept in the background,\r\nsaying never a word, as if he belonged to another species. The meal\r\nfinished, the dogs were fed, the smokers smoked by the fire, and under\r\nthe influences of fullness and tobacco the calm that settled on their\r\nfaces seemed almost divine, something like the mellow meditative glow\r\nportrayed on the countenances of saints. Then suddenly, as if awakening\r\nfrom a dream, each with a sigh or a grunt knocked the ashes out of his\r\npipe, yawned, gazed at the fire a few moments, said, “Well, I believe\r\nI’ll turn in,” and straightway vanished beneath his blankets. The fire\r\nsmouldered and flickered an hour or two longer; the stars shone\r\nbrighter; coons, coyotes, and owls stirred the silence here and there,\r\nwhile crickets and hylas made a cheerful, continuous music, so fitting\r\nand full that it seemed a part of the very body of the night. The only\r\ndiscordance came from a snoring sleeper, and the coughing sheep with\r\ndust in their throats. In the starlight the flock looked like a big gray\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\n_June 4._ The camp was astir at daybreak; coffee, bacon, and beans\r\nformed the breakfast, followed by quick dish-washing and packing. A\r\ngeneral bleating began about sunrise. As soon as a mother ewe arose, her\r\nlamb came bounding and bunting for its breakfast, and after the thousand\r\nyoungsters had been suckled the flock began to nibble and spread. The\r\nrestless wethers with ravenous appetites were the first to move, but\r\ndared not go far from the main body. Billy and the Indian and the\r\nChinaman kept them headed along the weary road, and allowed them to pick\r\nup what little they could find on a breadth of about a quarter of a\r\nmile. But as several flocks had already gone ahead of us, scarce a leaf,\r\ngreen or dry, was left; therefore the starving flock had to be hurried\r\non over the bare, hot hills to the nearest of the green pastures, about\r\ntwenty or thirty miles from here.\r\n\r\nThe pack-animals were led by Don Quixote, a heavy rifle over his\r\nshoulder intended for bears and wolves. This day has been as hot and\r\ndusty as the first, leading over gently sloping brown hills, with mostly\r\nthe same vegetation, excepting the strange-looking Sabine pine (_Pinus\r\nSabiniana_), which here forms small groves or is scattered among the\r\nblue oaks. The trunk divides at a height of fifteen or twenty feet into\r\ntwo or more stems, outleaning or nearly upright, with many straggling\r\nbranches and long gray needles, casting but little shade. In general\r\nappearance this tree looks more like a palm than a pine. The cones are\r\nabout six or seven inches long, about five in diameter, very heavy, and\r\nlast long after they fall, so that the ground beneath the trees is\r\ncovered with them. They make fine resiny, light-giving camp-fires, next\r\nto ears of Indian corn the most beautiful fuel I’ve ever seen. The nuts,\r\nthe Don tells me, are gathered in large quantities by the Digger Indians\r\nfor food. They are about as large and hard-shelled as hazelnuts—food\r\nand fire fit for the gods from the same fruit.\r\n\r\n_June 5._ This morning a few hours after setting out with the crawling\r\nsheep-cloud, we gained the summit of the first well-defined bench on the\r\nmountain-flank at Pino Blanco. The Sabine pines interest me greatly.\r\nThey are so airy and strangely palm-like I was eager to sketch them, and\r\nwas in a fever of excitement without accomplishing much. I managed to\r\nhalt long enough, however, to make a tolerably fair sketch of Pino\r\nBlanco peak from the southwest side, where there is a small field and\r\nvineyard irrigated by a stream that makes a pretty fall on its way down\r\na gorge by the roadside.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining the open summit of this first bench, feeling the natural\r\nexhilaration due to the slight elevation of a thousand feet or so, and\r\nthe hopes excited concerning the outlook to be obtained, a magnificent\r\nsection of the Merced Valley at what is called Horseshoe Bend came full\r\nin sight—a glorious wilderness that seemed to be calling with a\r\nthousand songful voices. Bold, down-sweeping slopes, feathered with\r\npines and clumps of manzanita with sunny, open spaces between them, make\r\nup most of the foreground; the middle and background present fold beyond\r\nfold of finely modeled hills and ridges rising into mountain-like masses\r\nin the distance, all covered with a shaggy growth of chaparral, mostly\r\nadenostoma, planted so marvelously close and even that it looks like\r\nsoft, rich plush without a single tree or bare spot. As far as the eye\r\ncan reach it extends, a heaving, swelling sea of green as regular and\r\ncontinuous as that produced by the heaths of Scotland. The sculpture of\r\nthe landscape is as striking in its main lines as in its lavish richness\r\nof detail; a grand congregation of massive heights with the river\r\nshining between, each carved into smooth, graceful folds without leaving\r\na single rocky angle exposed, as if the delicate fluting and ridging\r\nfashioned out of metamorphic slates had been carefully sandpapered. The\r\nwhole landscape showed design, like man’s noblest sculptures. How\r\nwonderful the power of its beauty! Gazing awe-stricken, I might have\r\nleft everything for it. Glad, endless work would then be mine tracing\r\nthe forces that have brought forth its features, its rocks and plants\r\nand animals and glorious weather. Beauty beyond thought everywhere,\r\nbeneath, above, made and being made forever. I gazed and gazed and\r\nlonged and admired until the dusty sheep and packs were far out of\r\nsight, made hurried notes and a sketch, though there was no need of\r\neither, for the colors and lines and expression of this divine\r\nlandscape-countenance are so burned into mind and heart they surely can\r\nnever grow dim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSESHOE BEND, MERCED RIVER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON SECOND BENCH. EDGE OF THE MAIN FOREST BELT ABOVE\r\nCOULTERVILLE, NEAR GREELEY’S MILL]\r\n\r\nThe evening of this charmed day is cool, calm, cloudless, and full of a\r\nkind of lightning I have never seen before—white glowing cloud-shaped\r\nmasses down among the trees and bushes, like quick-throbbing fireflies\r\nin the Wisconsin meadows rather than the so-called “wild fire.” The\r\nspreading hairs of the horses’ tails and sparks from our blankets show\r\nhow highly charged the air is.\r\n\r\n_June 6._ We are now on what may be called the second bench or plateau\r\nof the Range, after making many small ups and downs over belts of\r\nhill-waves, with, of course, corresponding changes in the vegetation. In\r\nopen spots many of the lowland compositæ are still to be found, and some\r\nof the Mariposa tulips and other conspicuous members of the lily family;\r\nbut the characteristic blue oak of the foothills is left below, and its\r\nplace is taken by a fine large species (_Quercus Californica_) with\r\ndeeply lobed deciduous leaves, picturesquely divided trunk, and broad,\r\nmassy, finely lobed and modeled head. Here also at a height of about\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet we come to the edge of the great coniferous\r\nforest, made up mostly of yellow pine with just a few sugar pines. We\r\nare now in the mountains and they are in us, kindling enthusiasm, making\r\nevery nerve quiver, filling every pore and cell of us. Our\r\nflesh-and-bone tabernacle seems transparent as glass to the beauty about\r\nus, as if truly an inseparable part of it, thrilling with the air and\r\ntrees, streams and rocks, in the waves of the sun,—a part of all\r\nnature, neither old nor young, sick nor well, but immortal. Just now I\r\ncan hardly conceive of any bodily condition dependent on food or breath\r\nany more than the ground or the sky. How glorious a conversion, so\r\ncomplete and wholesome it is, scarce memory enough of old bondage days\r\nleft as a standpoint to view it from! In this newness of life we seem to\r\nhave been so always.\r\n\r\nThrough a meadow opening in the pine woods I see snowy peaks about the\r\nheadwaters of the Merced above Yosemite. How near they seem and how\r\nclear their outlines on the blue air, or rather _in_ the blue air; for\r\nthey seem to be saturated with it. How consuming strong the invitation\r\nthey extend! Shall I be allowed to go to them? Night and day I’ll pray\r\nthat I may, but it seems too good to be true. Some one worthy will go,\r\nable for the Godful work, yet as far as I can I must drift about these\r\nlove-monument mountains, glad to be a servant of servants in so holy a\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nFound a lovely lily (_Calochortus albus_) in a shady adenostoma thicket\r\nnear Coulterville, in company with _Adiantum Chilense_. It is white with\r\na faint purplish tinge inside at the base of the petals, a most\r\nimpressive plant, pure as a snow crystal, one of the plant saints that\r\nall must love and be made so much the purer by it every time it is seen.\r\nIt puts the roughest mountaineer on his good behavior. With this plant\r\nthe whole world would seem rich though none other existed. It is not\r\neasy to keep on with the camp cloud while such plant people are standing\r\npreaching by the wayside.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon we passed a fine meadow bounded by stately pines,\r\nmostly the arrowy yellow pine, with here and there a noble sugar pine,\r\nits feathery arms outspread above the spires of its companion species in\r\nmarked contrast; a glorious tree, its cones fifteen to twenty inches\r\nlong, swinging like tassels at the ends of the branches with superb\r\nornamental effect. Saw some logs of this species at the Greeley Mill.\r\nThey are round and regular as if turned in a lathe, excepting the butt\r\ncuts, which have a few buttressing projections. The fragrance of the\r\nsugary sap is delicious and scents the mill and lumber yard. How\r\nbeautiful the ground beneath this pine thickly strewn with slender\r\nneedles and grand cones, and the piles of cone-scales, seed-wings and\r\nshells around the instep of each tree where the squirrels have been\r\nfeasting! They get the seeds by cutting off the scales at the base in\r\nregular order, following their spiral arrangement, and the two seeds at\r\nthe base of each scale, a hundred or two in a cone, must make a good\r\nmeal. The yellow pine cones and those of most other species and genera\r\nare held upside down on the ground by the Douglas squirrel, and turned\r\naround gradually until stripped, while he sits usually with his back to\r\na tree, probably for safety. Strange to say, he never seems to get\r\nhimself smeared with gum, not even his paws or whiskers—and how cleanly\r\nand beautiful in color the cone-litter kitchen-middens he makes.\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching the region of clouds and cool streams.\r\nMagnificent white cumuli appeared about noon above the Yosemite\r\nregion,—floating fountains refreshing the glorious wilderness,—sky\r\nmountains in whose pearly hills and dales the streams take their\r\nrise,—blessing with cooling shadows and rain. No rock landscape is more\r\nvaried in sculpture, none more delicately modeled than these landscapes\r\nof the sky; domes and peaks rising, swelling, white as finest marble\r\nand firmly outlined, a most impressive manifestation of world building.\r\nEvery rain-cloud, however fleeting, leaves its mark, not only on trees\r\nand flowers whose pulses are quickened, and on the replenished streams\r\nand lakes, but also on the rocks are its marks engraved whether we can\r\nsee them or not.\r\n\r\nI have been examining the curious and influential shrub _Adenostoma\r\nfasciculata_, first noticed about Horseshoe Bend. It is very abundant on\r\nthe lower slopes of the second plateau near Coulterville, forming a\r\ndense, almost impenetrable growth that looks dark in the distance. It\r\nbelongs to the rose family, is about six or eight feet high, has small\r\nwhite flowers in racemes eight to twelve inches long, round needle-like\r\nleaves, and reddish bark that becomes shreddy when old. It grows on\r\nsun-beaten slopes, and like grass is often swept away by running fires,\r\nbut is quickly renewed from the roots. Any trees that may have\r\nestablished themselves in its midst are at length killed by these fires,\r\nand this no doubt is the secret of the unbroken character of its broad\r\nbelts. A few manzanitas, which also rise again from the root after\r\nconsuming fires, make out to dwell with it, also a few bush\r\ncompositæ—baccharis and linosyris, and some liliaceous plants, mostly\r\ncalochortus and brodiæa, with deepset bulbs safe from fire. A multitude\r\nof birds and “wee, sleekit, cow’rin’, tim’rous beasties” find good homes\r\nin its deepest thickets, and the open bays and lanes that fringe the\r\nmargins of its main belts offer shelter and food to the deer when winter\r\nstorms drive them down from their high mountain pastures. A most\r\nadmirable plant! It is now in bloom, and I like to wear its pretty\r\nfragrant racemes in my buttonhole.\r\n\r\n_Azalea occidentalis_, another charming shrub, grows beside cool streams\r\nhereabouts and much higher in the Yosemite region. We found it this\r\nevening in bloom a few miles above Greeley’s Mill, where we are camped\r\nfor the night. It is closely related to the rhododendrons, is very showy\r\nand fragrant, and everybody must like it not only for itself but for the\r\nshady alders and willows, ferny meadows, and living water associated\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAnother conifer was met to-day,—incense cedar (_Libocedrus decurrens_),\r\na large tree with warm yellow-green foliage in flat plumes like those of\r\narborvitæ, bark cinnamon-colored, and as the boles of the old trees are\r\nwithout limbs they make striking pillars in the woods where the sun\r\nchances to shine on them—a worthy companion of the kingly sugar and\r\nyellow pines. I feel strangely attracted to this tree. The brown\r\nclose-grained wood, as well as the small scale-like leaves, is fragrant,\r\nand the flat overlapping plumes make fine beds, and must shed the rain\r\nwell. It would be delightful to be storm-bound beneath one of these\r\nnoble, hospitable, inviting old trees, its broad sheltering arms bent\r\ndown like a tent, incense rising from the fire made from its dry fallen\r\nbranches, and a hearty wind chanting overhead. But the weather is calm\r\nto-night, and our camp is only a sheep camp. We are near the North Fork\r\nof the Merced. The night wind is telling the wonders of the upper\r\nmountains, their snow fountains and gardens, forests and groves; even\r\ntheir topography is in its tones. And the stars, the everlasting sky\r\nlilies, how bright they are now that we have climbed above the lowland\r\ndust! The horizon is bounded and adorned by a spiry wall of pines, every\r\ntree harmoniously related to every other; definite symbols, divine\r\nhieroglyphics written with sunbeams. Would I could understand them! The\r\nstream flowing past the camp through ferns and lilies and alders makes\r\nsweet music to the ear, but the pines marshaled around the edge of the\r\nsky make a yet sweeter music to the eye. Divine beauty all. Here I\r\ncould stay tethered forever with just bread and water, nor would I be\r\nlonely; loved friends and neighbors, as love for everything increased,\r\nwould seem all the nearer however many the miles and mountains between\r\nus.\r\n\r\n_June 7._ The sheep were sick last night, and many of them are still far\r\nfrom well, hardly able to leave camp, coughing, groaning, looking\r\nwretched and pitiful, all from eating the leaves of the blessed azalea.\r\nSo at least say the shepherd and the Don. Having had but little grass\r\nsince they left the plains, they are starving, and so eat anything green\r\nthey can get. “Sheep men” call azalea “sheep-poison,” and wonder what\r\nthe Creator was thinking about when he made it,—so desperately does\r\nsheep business blind and degrade, though supposed to have a refining\r\ninfluence in the good old days we read of. The California sheep owner is\r\nin haste to get rich, and often does, now that pasturage costs nothing,\r\nwhile the climate is so favorable that no winter food supply,\r\nshelter-pens, or barns are required. Therefore large flocks may be kept\r\nat slight expense, and large profits realized, the money invested\r\ndoubling, it is claimed, every other year. This quickly acquired wealth\r\nusually creates desire for more. Then indeed the wool is drawn close\r\ndown over the poor fellow’s eyes, dimming or shutting out almost\r\neverything worth seeing.\r\n\r\nAs for the shepherd, his case is still worse, especially in winter when\r\nhe lives alone in a cabin. For, though stimulated at times by hopes of\r\none day owning a flock and getting rich like his boss, he at the same\r\ntime is likely to be degraded by the life he leads, and seldom reaches\r\nthe dignity or advantage—or disadvantage—of ownership. The degradation\r\nin his case has for cause one not far to seek. He is solitary most of\r\nthe year, and solitude to most people seems hard to bear. He seldom has\r\nmuch good mental work or recreation in the way of books. Coming into his\r\ndingy hovel-cabin at night, stupidly weary, he finds nothing to balance\r\nand level his life with the universe. No, after his dull drag all day\r\nafter the sheep, he must get his supper; he is likely to slight this\r\ntask and try to satisfy his hunger with whatever comes handy. Perhaps no\r\nbread is baked; then he just makes a few grimy flapjacks in his unwashed\r\nfrying-pan, boils a handful of tea, and perhaps fries a few strips of\r\nrusty bacon. Usually there are dried peaches or apples in the cabin, but\r\nhe hates to be bothered with the cooking of them, just swallows the\r\nbacon and flapjacks, and depends on the genial stupefaction of tobacco\r\nfor the rest. Then to bed, often without removing the clothing worn\r\nduring the day. Of course his health suffers, reacting on his mind; and\r\nseeing nobody for weeks or months, he finally becomes semi-insane or\r\nwholly so.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd in Scotland seldom thinks of being anything but a shepherd.\r\nHe has probably descended from a race of shepherds and inherited a love\r\nand aptitude for the business almost as marked as that of his collie. He\r\nhas but a small flock to look after, sees his family and neighbors, has\r\ntime for reading in fine weather, and often carries books to the fields\r\nwith which he may converse with kings. The oriental shepherd, we read,\r\ncalled his sheep by name; they knew his voice and followed him. The\r\nflocks must have been small and easily managed, allowing piping on the\r\nhills and ample leisure for reading and thinking. But whatever the\r\nblessings of sheep-culture in other times and countries, the California\r\nshepherd, as far as I’ve seen or heard, is never quite sane for any\r\nconsiderable time. Of all Nature’s voices baa is about all he hears.\r\nEven the howls and ki-yis of coyotes might be blessings if well heard,\r\nbut he hears them only through a blur of mutton and wool, and they do\r\nhim no good.\r\n\r\nThe sick sheep are getting well, and the shepherd is discoursing on the\r\nvarious poisons lurking in these high pastures—azalea, kalmia, alkali.\r\nAfter crossing the North Fork of the Merced we turned to the left toward\r\nPilot Peak, and made a considerable ascent on a rocky, brush-covered\r\nridge to Brown’s Flat, where for the first time since leaving the plains\r\nthe flock is enjoying plenty of green grass. Mr. Delaney intends to seek\r\na permanent camp somewhere in the neighborhood, to last several weeks.\r\n\r\nBefore noon we passed Bower Cave, a delightful marble palace, not dark\r\nand dripping, but filled with sunshine, which pours into it through its\r\nwide-open mouth facing the south. It has a fine, deep, clear little lake\r\nwith mossy banks embowered with broad-leaved maples, all under ground,\r\nwholly unlike anything I have seen in the cave line even in Kentucky,\r\nwhere a large part of the State is honeycombed with caves. This curious\r\nspecimen of subterranean scenery is located on a belt of marble that is\r\nsaid to extend from the north end of the Range to the extreme south.\r\nMany other caves occur on the belt, but none like this, as far as I have\r\nlearned, combining as it does sunny outdoor brightness and vegetation\r\nwith the crystalline beauty of the underworld. It is claimed by a\r\nFrenchman, who has fenced and locked it, placed a boat on the lakelet\r\nand seats on the mossy bank under the maple trees, and charges a dollar\r\nadmission fee. Being on one of the ways to the Yosemite Valley, a good\r\nmany tourists visit it during the travel months of summer, regarding it\r\nas an interesting addition to their Yosemite wonders.\r\n\r\nPoison oak or poison ivy (_Rhus diversiloba_), both as a bush and a\r\nscrambler up trees and rocks, is common throughout the foothill region\r\nup to a height of at least three thousand feet above the sea. It is\r\nsomewhat troublesome to most travelers, inflaming the skin and eyes, but\r\nblends harmoniously with its companion plants, and many a charming\r\nflower leans confidingly upon it for protection and shade. I have\r\noftentimes found the curious twining lily (_Stropholirion Californicum_)\r\nclimbing its branches, showing no fear but rather congenial\r\ncompanionship. Sheep eat it without apparent ill effects; so do horses\r\nto some extent, though not fond of it, and to many persons it is\r\nharmless. Like most other things not apparently useful to man, it has\r\nfew friends, and the blind question, “Why was it made?” goes on and on\r\nwith never a guess that first of all it might have been made for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBrown’s Flat is a shallow fertile valley on the top of the divide\r\nbetween the North Fork of the Merced and Bull Creek, commanding\r\nmagnificent views in every direction. Here the adventurous pioneer David\r\nBrown made his headquarters for many years, dividing his time between\r\ngold-hunting and bear-hunting. Where could lonely hunter find a better\r\nsolitude? Game in the woods, gold in the rocks, health and exhilaration\r\nin the air, while the colors and cloud furniture of the sky are ever\r\ninspiring through all sorts of weather. Though sternly practical, like\r\nmost pioneers, old David seems to have been uncommonly fond of scenery.\r\nMr. Delaney, who knew him well, tells me that he dearly loved to climb\r\nto the summit of a commanding ridge to gaze abroad over the forest to\r\nthe snow-clad peaks and sources of the rivers, and over the foreground\r\nvalleys and gulches to note where miners were at work or claims were\r\nabandoned, judging by smoke from cabins and camp-fires, the sounds of\r\naxes, etc.; and when a rifle-shot was heard, to guess who was the\r\nhunter, whether Indian or some poacher on his wide domain. His dog Sandy\r\naccompanied him everywhere, and well the little hairy mountaineer knew\r\nand loved his master and his master’s aims. In deer-hunting he had but\r\nlittle to do, trotting behind his master as he slowly made his way\r\nthrough the wood, careful not to step heavily on dry twigs, scanning\r\nopen spots in the chaparral, where the game loves to feed in the early\r\nmorning and towards sunset; peering cautiously over ridges as new\r\noutlooks were reached, and along the meadowy borders of streams. But\r\nwhen bears were hunted, little Sandy became more important, and it was\r\nas a bear-hunter that Brown became famous. His hunting method, as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Delaney, who had passed many a night with him in his\r\nlonely cabin and learned his stories, was simply to go slowly and\r\nsilently through the best bear pastures, with his dog and rifle and a\r\nfew pounds of flour, until he found a fresh track and then follow it to\r\nthe death, paying no heed to the time required. Wherever the bear went\r\nhe followed, led by little Sandy, who had a keen nose and never lost the\r\ntrack, however rocky the ground. When high open points were reached, the\r\nlikeliest places were carefully scanned. The time of year enabled the\r\nhunter to determine approximately where the bear would be found,—in the\r\nspring and early summer on open spots about the banks of streams and\r\nspringy places eating grass and clover and lupines, or in dry meadows\r\nfeasting on strawberries; toward the end of summer, on dry ridges,\r\nfeasting on manzanita berries, sitting on his haunches, pulling down the\r\nladen branches with his paws, and pressing them together so as to get\r\ngood compact mouthfuls however much mixed with twigs and leaves; in the\r\nIndian summer, beneath the pines, chewing the cones cut off by the\r\nsquirrels, or occasionally climbing a tree to gnaw and break off the\r\nfruitful branches. In late autumn, when acorns are ripe, Bruin’s\r\nfavorite feeding-grounds are groves of the California oak in park-like\r\ncañon flats. Always the cunning hunter knew where to look, and seldom\r\ncame upon Bruin unawares. When the hot scent showed the dangerous game\r\nwas nigh, a long halt was made, and the intricacies of the topography\r\nand vegetation leisurely scanned to catch a glimpse of the shaggy\r\nwanderer, or to at least determine where he was most likely to be.\r\n\r\n“Whenever,” said the hunter, “I saw a bear before it saw me I had no\r\ntrouble in killing it. I just studied the lay of the land and got to\r\nleeward of it no matter how far around I had to go, and then worked up\r\nto within a few hundred yards or so, at the foot of a tree that I could\r\neasily climb, but too small for the bear to climb. Then I looked well to\r\nthe condition of my rifle, took off my boots so as to climb well if\r\nnecessary, and waited until the bear turned its side in clear view when\r\nI could make a sure or at least a good shot. In case it showed fight I\r\nclimbed out of reach. But bears are slow and awkward with their eyes,\r\nand being to leeward of them they could not scent me, and I often got in\r\na second shot before they noticed the smoke. Usually, however, they run\r\nwhen wounded and hide in the brush. I let them run a good safe time\r\nbefore I ventured to follow them, and Sandy was pretty sure to find them\r\ndead. If not, he barked and drew their attention, and occasionally\r\nrushed in for a distracting bite, so that I was able to get to a safe\r\ndistance for a final shot. Oh yes, bear-hunting is safe enough when\r\nfollowed in a safe way, though like every other business it has its\r\naccidents, and little doggie and I have had some close calls. Bears like\r\nto keep out of the way of men as a general thing, but if an old, lean,\r\nhungry mother with cubs met a man on her own ground she would, in my\r\nopinion, try to catch and eat him. This would be only fair play anyhow,\r\nfor we eat them, but nobody hereabout has been used for bear grub that I\r\nknow of.”\r\n\r\nBrown had left his mountain home ere we arrived, but a considerable\r\nnumber of Digger Indians still linger in their cedar-bark huts on the\r\nedge of the flat. They were attracted in the first place by the white\r\nhunter whom they had learned to respect, and to whom they looked for\r\nguidance and protection against their enemies the Pah Utes, who\r\nsometimes made raids across from the east side of the Range to plunder\r\nthe stores of the comparatively feeble Diggers and steal their wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN CAMP ON THE NORTH FORK OF THE MERCED\r\n\r\n\r\n_June 8._ The sheep, now grassy and good-natured, slowly nibbled their\r\nway down into the valley of the North Fork of the Merced at the foot of\r\nPilot Peak Ridge to the place selected by the Don for our first central\r\ncamp, a picturesque hopper-shaped hollow formed by converging hill\r\nslopes at a bend of the river. Here racks for dishes and provisions were\r\nmade in the shade of the river-bank trees, and beds of fern fronds,\r\ncedar plumes, and various flowers, each to the taste of its owner, and a\r\ncorral back on the open flat for the wool.\r\n\r\n_June 9._ How deep our sleep last night in the mountain’s heart, beneath\r\nthe trees and stars, hushed by solemn-sounding waterfalls and many small\r\nsoothing voices in sweet accord whispering peace! And our first pure\r\nmountain day, warm, calm, cloudless,—how immeasurable it seems, how\r\nserenely wild! I can scarcely remember its beginning. Along the river,\r\nover the hills, in the ground, in the sky, spring work is going on with\r\njoyful enthusiasm, new life, new beauty, unfolding, unrolling in\r\nglorious exuberant extravagance,—new birds in their nests, new winged\r\ncreatures in the air, and new leaves, new flowers, spreading, shining,\r\nrejoicing everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe trees about the camp stand close, giving ample shade for ferns and\r\nlilies, while back from the bank most of the sunshine reaches the\r\nground, calling up the grasses and flowers in glorious array, tall\r\nbromus waving like bamboos, starry compositæ, monardella, Mariposa\r\ntulips, lupines, gilias, violets, glad children of light. Soon every\r\nfern frond will be unrolled, great beds of common pteris and woodwardia\r\nalong the river, wreaths and rosettes of pellæa and cheilanthes on sunny\r\nrocks. Some of the woodwardia fronds are already six feet high.\r\n\r\nA handsome little shrub, _Chamæbatia foliolosa_, belonging to the rose\r\nfamily, spreads a yellow-green mantle beneath the sugar pines for miles\r\nwithout a break, not mixed or roughened with other plants. Only here and\r\nthere a Washington lily may be seen nodding above its even surface, or a\r\nbunch or two of tall bromus as if for ornament. This fine carpet shrub\r\nbegins to appear at, say, twenty-five hundred or three thousand feet\r\nabove sea level, is about knee high or less, has brown branches, and the\r\nlargest stems are only about half an inch in diameter. The leaves, light\r\nyellow green, thrice pinnate and finely cut, give them a rich ferny\r\nappearance, and they are dotted with minute glands that secrete wax with\r\na peculiar pleasant odor that blends finely with the spicy fragrance of\r\nthe pines. The flowers are white, five eighths of an inch in diameter,\r\nand look like those of the strawberry. Am delighted with this little\r\nbush. It is the only true carpet shrub of this part of the Sierra. The\r\nmanzanita, rhamnus, and most of the species of ceanothus make shaggy\r\nrugs and border fringes rather than carpets or mantles.\r\n\r\nThe sheep do not take kindly to their new pastures, perhaps from being\r\ntoo closely hemmed in by the hills. They are never fully at rest. Last\r\nnight they were frightened, probably by bears or coyotes prowling and\r\nplanning for a share of the grand mass of mutton.\r\n\r\n_June 10._ Very warm. We get water for the camp from a rock basin at the\r\nfoot of a picturesque cascading reach of the river where it is well\r\nstirred and made lively without being beaten into dusty foam. The rock\r\nhere is black metamorphic slate, worn into smooth knobs in the stream\r\nchannels, contrasting with the fine gray and white cascading water as it\r\nglides and glances and falls in lace-like sheets and braided overfolding\r\ncurrents. Tufts of sedge growing on the rock knobs that rise above the\r\nsurface produce a charming effect, the long elastic leaves arching over\r\nin every direction, the tips of the longest drooping into the current,\r\nwhich dividing against the projecting rocks makes still finer lines,\r\nuniting with the sedges to see how beautiful the happy stream can be\r\nmade. Nor is this all, for the giant saxifrage also is growing on some\r\nof the knob rock islets, firmly anchored and displaying their broad,\r\nround, umbrella-like leaves in showy groups by themselves, or above the\r\nsedge tufts. The flowers of this species (_Saxifraga peltata_) are\r\npurple, and form tall glandular racemes that are in bloom before the\r\nappearance of the leaves. The fleshy root-stocks grip the rock in cracks\r\nand hollows, and thus enable the plant to hold on against occasional\r\nfloods,—a marked species employed by Nature to make yet more beautiful\r\nthe most interesting portions of these cool clear streams. Near camp the\r\ntrees arch over from bank to bank, making a leafy tunnel full of soft\r\nsubdued light, through which the young river sings and shines like a\r\nhappy living creature.\r\n\r\nHeard a few peals of thunder from the upper Sierra, and saw firm white\r\nbossy cumuli rising back of the pines. This was about noon.\r\n\r\n_June 11._ On one of the eastern branches of the river discovered some\r\ncharming cascades with a pool at the foot of each of them. White dashing\r\nwater, a few bushes and tufts of carex on ledges leaning over with fine\r\neffect, and large orange lilies assembled in superb groups on fertile\r\nsoil-beds beside the pools.\r\n\r\nThere are no large meadows or grassy plains near camp to supply lasting\r\npasture for our thousands of busy nibblers. The main dependence is\r\nceanothus brush on the hills and tufted grass patches here and there,\r\nwith lupines and pea-vines among the flowers on sunny open spaces. Large\r\nareas have already been stripped bare, or nearly so, compelling the poor\r\nhungry wool bundles to scatter far and wide, keeping the shepherds and\r\ndogs at the top of their speed to hold them within bounds. Mr. Delaney\r\nhas gone back to the plains, taking the Indian and Chinaman with him,\r\nleaving instruction to keep the flock here or hereabouts until his\r\nreturn, which he promised would not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nHow fine the weather is! Nothing more celestial can I conceive. How\r\ngently the winds blow! Scarce can these tranquil air-currents be called\r\nwinds. They seem the very breath of Nature, whispering peace to every\r\nliving thing. Down in the camp dell there is no swaying of tree-tops;\r\nmost of the time not a leaf moves. I don’t remember having seen a\r\nsingle lily swinging on its stalk, though they are so tall the least\r\nbreeze would rock them. What grand bells these lilies have! Some of them\r\nbig enough for children’s bonnets. I have been sketching them, and would\r\nfain draw every leaf of their wide shining whorls and every curved and\r\nspotted petal. More beautiful, better kept gardens cannot be imagined.\r\nThe species is _Lilium pardalinum_, five to six feet high, leaf-whorls a\r\nfoot wide, flowers about six inches wide, bright orange, purple spotted\r\nin the throat, segments revolute—a majestic plant.\r\n\r\n_June 12._ A slight sprinkle of rain—large drops far apart, falling\r\nwith hearty pat and plash on leaves and stones and into the mouths of\r\nthe flowers. Cumuli rising to the eastward. How beautiful their pearly\r\nbosses! How well they harmonize with the upswelling rocks beneath them.\r\nMountains of the sky, solid-looking, finely sculptured, their richly\r\nvaried topography wonderfully defined. Never before have I seen clouds\r\nso substantial looking in form and texture. Nearly every day toward noon\r\nthey rise with visible swelling motion as if new worlds were being\r\ncreated. And how fondly they brood and hover over the gardens and\r\nforests with their cooling shadows and showers, keeping every petal and\r\nleaf in glad health and heart. One may fancy the clouds themselves are\r\nplants, springing up in the sky-fields at the call of the sun, growing\r\nin beauty until they reach their prime, scattering rain and hail like\r\nberries and seeds, then wilting and dying.\r\n\r\nThe mountain live oak, common here and a thousand feet or so higher, is\r\nlike the live oak of Florida, not only in general appearance, foliage,\r\nbark, and wide-branching habit, but in its tough, knotty, unwedgeable\r\nwood. Standing alone with plenty of elbow room, the largest trees are\r\nabout seven to eight feet in diameter near the ground, sixty feet high,\r\nand as wide or wider across the head. The leaves are small and\r\nundivided, mostly without teeth or wavy edging, though on young shoots\r\nsome are sharply serrated, both kinds being found on the same tree. The\r\ncups of the medium-sized acorns are shallow, thick walled, and covered\r\nwith a golden dust of minute hairs. Some of the trees have hardly any\r\nmain trunk, dividing near the ground into large wide-spreading limbs,\r\nand these, dividing again and again, terminate in long, drooping,\r\ncord-like branchlets, many of which reach nearly to the ground, while a\r\ndense canopy of short, shining, leafy branchlets forms a round head\r\nwhich looks something like a cumulus cloud when the sunshine is\r\npouring over it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAMP, NORTH FORK OF THE MERCED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN LIVE OAK (_Quercus chrysolepis_), EIGHT FEET IN\r\nDIAMETER]\r\n\r\nA marked plant is the bush poppy (_Dendromecon rigidum_), found on the\r\nhot hillsides near camp, the only woody member of the order I have yet\r\nmet in all my walks. Its flowers are bright orange yellow, an inch to\r\ntwo inches wide, fruit-pods three or four inches long, slender and\r\ncurving,—height of bushes about four feet, made up of many slim,\r\nstraight branches, radiating from the root,—a companion of the\r\nmanzanita and other sun-loving chaparral shrubs.\r\n\r\n_June 13._ Another glorious Sierra day in which one seems to be\r\ndissolved and absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where. Life\r\nseems neither long nor short, and we take no more heed to save time or\r\nmake haste than do the trees and stars. This is true freedom, a good\r\npractical sort of immortality. Yonder rises another white skyland. How\r\nsharply the yellow pine spires and the palm-like crowns of the sugar\r\npines are outlined on its smooth white domes. And hark! the grand\r\nthunder billows booming, rolling from ridge to ridge, followed by the\r\nfaithful shower.\r\n\r\nA good many herbaceous plants come thus far up the mountains from the\r\nplains, and are now in flower, two months later than their lowland\r\nrelatives. Saw a few columbines to-day. Most of the ferns are in their\r\nprime,—rock ferns on the sunny hillsides, cheilanthes, pellæa,\r\ngymnogramme; woodwardia, aspidium, woodsia along the stream banks, and\r\nthe common _Pteris aquilina_ on sandy flats. This last, however common,\r\nis here making shows of strong, exuberant, abounding beauty to set the\r\nbotanist wild with admiration. I measured some scarce full grown that\r\nare more than seven feet high. Though the commonest and most widely\r\ndistributed of all the ferns, I might almost say that I never saw it\r\nbefore. The broad-shouldered fronds held high on smooth stout stalks\r\ngrowing close together, overleaning and overlapping, make a complete\r\nceiling, beneath which one may walk erect over several acres without\r\nbeing seen, as if beneath a roof. And how soft and lovely the light\r\nstreaming through this living ceiling, revealing the arching branching\r\nribs and veins of the fronds as the framework of countless panes of pale\r\ngreen and yellow plant-glass nicely fitted together—a fairyland created\r\nout of the commonest fern-stuff.\r\n\r\nThe smaller animals wander about as if in a tropical forest. I saw the\r\nentire flock of sheep vanish at one side of a patch and reappear a\r\nhundred yards farther on at the other, their progress betrayed only by\r\nthe jerking and trembling of the fronds; and strange to say very few of\r\nthe stout woody stalks were broken. I sat a long time beneath the\r\ntallest fronds, and never enjoyed anything in the way of a bower of wild\r\nleaves more strangely impressive. Only spread a fern frond over a man’s\r\nhead and worldly cares are cast out, and freedom and beauty and peace\r\ncome in. The waving of a pine tree on the top of a mountain,—a magic\r\nwand in Nature’s hand,—every devout mountaineer knows its power; but\r\nthe marvelous beauty value of what the Scotch call a breckan in a still\r\ndell, what poet has sung this? It would seem impossible that any one,\r\nhowever incrusted with care, could escape the Godful influence of these\r\nsacred fern forests. Yet this very day I saw a shepherd pass through one\r\nof the finest of them without betraying more feeling than his sheep.\r\n“What do you think of these grand ferns?” I asked. “Oh, they’re only\r\nd——d big brakes,” he replied.\r\n\r\nLizards of every temper, style, and color dwell here, seemingly as happy\r\nand companionable as the birds and squirrels. Lowly, gentle fellow\r\nmortals, enjoying God’s sunshine, and doing the best they can in getting\r\na living, I like to watch them at their work and play. They bear\r\nacquaintance well, and one likes them the better the longer one looks\r\ninto their beautiful, innocent eyes. They are easily tamed, and one soon\r\nlearns to love them, as they dart about on the hot rocks, swift as\r\ndragon-flies. The eye can hardly follow them; but they never make\r\nlong-sustained runs, usually only about ten or twelve feet, then a\r\nsudden stop, and as sudden a start again; going all their journeys by\r\nquick, jerking impulses. These many stops I find are necessary as rests,\r\nfor they are short-winded, and when pursued steadily are soon out of\r\nbreath, pant pitifully, and are easily caught. Their bodies are more\r\nthan half tail, but these tails are well managed, never heavily dragged\r\nnor curved up as if hard to carry; on the contrary, they seem to follow\r\nthe body lightly of their own will. Some are colored like the sky,\r\nbright as bluebirds, others gray like the lichened rocks on which they\r\nhunt and bask. Even the horned toad of the plains is a mild, harmless\r\ncreature, and so are the snake-like species which glide in curves with\r\ntrue snake motion, while their small, undeveloped limbs drag as useless\r\nappendages. One specimen fourteen inches long which I observed closely\r\nmade no use whatever of its tender, sprouting limbs, but glided with all\r\nthe soft, sly ease and grace of a snake. Here comes a little, gray,\r\ndusty fellow who seems to know and trust me, running about my feet, and\r\nlooking up cunningly into my face. Carlo is watching, makes a quick\r\npounce on him, for the fun of the thing I suppose; but Liz has shot away\r\nfrom his paws like an arrow, and is safe in the recesses of a clump of\r\nchaparral. Gentle saurians, dragons, descendants of an ancient and\r\nmighty race, Heaven bless you all and make your virtues known! for few\r\nof us know as yet that scales may cover fellow creatures as gentle and\r\nlovable as feathers, or hair, or cloth.\r\n\r\nMastodons and elephants used to live here no great geological time ago,\r\nas shown by their bones, often discovered by miners in washing\r\ngold-gravel. And bears of at least two species are here now, besides the\r\nCalifornia lion or panther, and wild cats, wolves, foxes, snakes,\r\nscorpions, wasps, tarantulas; but one is almost tempted at times to\r\nregard a small savage black ant as the master existence of this vast\r\nmountain world. These fearless, restless, wandering imps, though only\r\nabout a quarter of an inch long, are fonder of fighting and biting than\r\nany beast I know. They attack every living thing around their homes,\r\noften without cause as far as I can see. Their bodies are mostly jaws\r\ncurved like ice-hooks, and to get work for these weapons seems to be\r\ntheir chief aim and pleasure. Most of their colonies are established in\r\nliving oaks somewhat decayed or hollowed, in which they can conveniently\r\nbuild their cells. These are chosen probably because of their strength\r\nas opposed to the attacks of animals and storms. They work both day and\r\nnight, creep into dark caves, climb the highest trees, wander and hunt\r\nthrough cool ravines as well as on hot, unshaded ridges, and extend\r\ntheir highways and byways over everything but water and sky. From the\r\nfoothills to a mile above the level of the sea nothing can stir without\r\ntheir knowledge; and alarms are spread in an incredibly short time,\r\nwithout any howl or cry that we can hear. I can’t understand the need of\r\ntheir ferocious courage; there seems to be no common sense in it.\r\nSometimes, no doubt, they fight in defense of their homes, but they\r\nfight anywhere and always wherever they can find anything to bite. As\r\nsoon as a vulnerable spot is discovered on man or beast, they stand on\r\ntheir heads and sink their jaws, and though torn limb from limb, they\r\nwill yet hold on and die biting deeper. When I contemplate this fierce\r\ncreature so widely distributed and strongly intrenched, I see that much\r\nremains to be done ere the world is brought under the rule of universal\r\npeace and love.\r\n\r\nOn my way to camp a few minutes ago, I passed a dead pine nearly ten\r\nfeet in diameter. It has been enveloped in fire from top to bottom so\r\nthat now it looks like a grand black pillar set up as a monument. In\r\nthis noble shaft a colony of large jet-black ants have established\r\nthemselves, laboriously cutting tunnels and cells through the wood,\r\nwhether sound or decayed. The entire trunk seems to have been\r\nhoneycombed, judging by the size of the talus of gnawed chips like\r\nsawdust piled up around its base. They are more intelligent looking than\r\ntheir small, belligerent, strong-scented brethren, and have better\r\nmanners, though quick to fight when required. Their towns are carved in\r\nfallen trunks as well as in those left standing, but never in sound,\r\nliving trees or in the ground. When you happen to sit down to rest or\r\ntake notes near a colony, some wandering hunter is sure to find you and\r\ncome cautiously forward to discover the nature of the intruder and what\r\nought to be done. If you are not too near the town and keep perfectly\r\nstill he may run across your feet a few times, over your legs and hands\r\nand face, up your trousers, as if taking your measure and getting\r\ncomprehensive views, then go in peace without raising an alarm. If,\r\nhowever, a tempting spot is offered or some suspicious movement excites\r\nhim, a bite follows, and such a bite! I fancy that a bear or wolf bite\r\nis not to be compared with it. A quick electric flame of pain flashes\r\nalong the outraged nerves, and you discover for the first time how great\r\nis the capacity for sensation you are possessed of. A shriek, a grab for\r\nthe animal, and a bewildered stare follow this bite of bites as one\r\ncomes back to consciousness from sudden eclipse. Fortunately, if\r\ncareful, one need not be bitten oftener than once or twice in a\r\nlifetime. This wonderful electric species is about three fourths of an\r\ninch long. Bears are fond of them, and tear and gnaw their home-logs to\r\npieces, and roughly devour the eggs, larvæ, parent ants, and the rotten\r\nor sound wood of the cells, all in one spicy acid hash. The Digger\r\nIndians also are fond of the larvæ and even of the perfect ants, so I\r\nhave been told by old mountaineers. They bite off and reject the head,\r\nand eat the tickly acid body with keen relish. Thus are the poor biters\r\nbitten, like every other biter, big or little, in the world’s great\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThere is also a fine, active, intelligent-looking red species,\r\nintermediate in size between the above. They dwell in the ground, and\r\nbuild large piles of seed husks, leaves, straw, etc., over their nests.\r\nTheir food seems to be mostly insects and plant leaves, seeds and sap.\r\nHow many mouths Nature has to fill, how many neighbors we have, how\r\nlittle we know about them, and how seldom we get in each other’s way!\r\nThen to think of the infinite numbers of smaller fellow mortals,\r\ninvisibly small, compared with which the smallest ants are as mastodons.\r\n\r\n_June 14._ The pool-basins below the falls and cascades hereabouts,\r\nformed by the heavy down-plunging currents, are kept nicely clean and\r\nclear of detritus. The heavier parts of the material swept over the\r\nfalls are heaped up a short distance in front of the basins in the form\r\nof a dam, thus tending, together with erosion, to increase their size.\r\nSudden changes, however, are effected during the spring floods, when the\r\nsnow is melting and the upper tributaries are roaring loud from “bank to\r\nbrae.” Then boulders that have fallen into the channels, and which the\r\nordinary summer and winter currents were unable to move, are suddenly\r\nswept forward as by a mighty besom, hurled over the falls into these\r\npools, and piled up in a new dam together with part of the old one,\r\nwhile some of the smaller boulders are carried further down stream and\r\nvariously lodged according to size and shape, all seeking rest where the\r\nforce of the current is less than the resistance they are able to offer.\r\nBut the greatest changes made in these relations of fall, pool, and dam\r\nare caused, not by the ordinary spring floods, but by extraordinary ones\r\nthat occur at irregular intervals. The testimony of trees growing on\r\nflood boulder deposits shows that a century or more has passed since the\r\nlast master flood came to awaken everything movable to go swirling and\r\ndancing on wonderful journeys. These floods may occur during the summer,\r\nwhen heavy thunder-showers, called “cloud-bursts,” fall on wide, steeply\r\ninclined stream basins furrowed by converging channels, which suddenly\r\ngather the waters together into the main trunk in booming torrents of\r\nenormous transporting power, though short lived.\r\n\r\nOne of these ancient flood boulders stands firm in the middle of the\r\nstream channel, just below the lower edge of the pool dam at the foot of\r\nthe fall nearest our camp. It is a nearly cubical mass of granite about\r\neight feet high, plushed with mosses over the top and down the sides to\r\nordinary high-water mark. When I climbed on top of it to-day and lay\r\ndown to rest, it seemed the most romantic spot I had yet found—the one\r\nbig stone with its mossy level top and smooth sides standing square and\r\nfirm and solitary, like an altar, the fall in front of it bathing it\r\nlightly with the finest of the spray, just enough to keep its moss cover\r\nfresh; the clear green pool beneath, with its foam-bells and its half\r\ncircle of lilies leaning forward like a band of admirers, and flowering\r\ndogwood and alder trees leaning over all in sun-sifted arches. How\r\nsoothingly, restfully cool it is beneath that leafy, translucent\r\nceiling, and how delightful the water music—the deep bass tones of the\r\nfall, the clashing, ringing spray, and infinite variety of small low\r\ntones of the current gliding past the side of the boulder-island, and\r\nglinting against a thousand smaller stones down the ferny channel! All\r\nthis shut in; every one of these influences acting at short range as if\r\nin a quiet room. The place seemed holy, where one might hope to see God.\r\n\r\nAfter dark, when the camp was at rest, I groped my way back to the altar\r\nboulder and passed the night on it,—above the water, beneath the leaves\r\nand stars,—everything still more impressive than by day, the fall seen\r\ndimly white, singing Nature’s old love song with solemn enthusiasm,\r\nwhile the stars peering through the leaf-roof seemed to join in the\r\nwhite water’s song. Precious night, precious day to abide in me forever.\r\nThanks be to God for this immortal gift.\r\n\r\n_June 15._ Another reviving morning. Down the long mountain-slopes the\r\nsunbeams pour, gilding the awakening pines, cheering every needle,\r\nfilling every living thing with joy. Robins are singing in the alder and\r\nmaple groves, the same old song that has cheered and sweetened countless\r\nseasons over almost all of our blessed continent. In this mountain\r\nhollow they seem as much at home as in farmers’ orchards. Bullock’s\r\noriole and the Louisiana tanager are here also, with many warblers and\r\nother little mountain troubadours, most of them now busy about their\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nDiscovered another magnificent specimen of the goldcup oak six feet in\r\ndiameter, a Douglas spruce seven feet, and a twining lily\r\n(_Stropholirion_), with stem eight feet long, and sixty rose-colored\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR PINE]\r\n\r\nSugar pine cones are cylindrical, slightly tapered at the end and\r\nrounded at the base. Found one to-day nearly twenty-four inches long and\r\nsix in diameter, the scales being open. Another specimen nineteen inches\r\nlong; the average length of full-grown cones on trees favorably situated\r\nis nearly eighteen inches. On the lower edge of the belt at a height of\r\nabout twenty-five hundred feet above the sea they are smaller, say a\r\nfoot to fifteen inches long, and at a height of seven thousand feet or\r\nmore near the upper limits of its growth in the Yosemite region they are\r\nabout the same size. This noble tree is an inexhaustible study and\r\nsource of pleasure. I never weary of gazing at its grand tassel cones,\r\nits perfectly round bole one hundred feet or more without a limb, the\r\nfine purplish color of its bark, and its magnificent outsweeping,\r\ndown-curving feathery arms forming a crown always bold and striking and\r\nexhilarating. In habit and general port it looks somewhat like a palm,\r\nbut no palm that I have yet seen displays such majesty of form and\r\nbehavior either when poised silent and thoughtful in sunshine, or\r\nwide-awake waving in storm winds with every needle quivering. When young\r\nit is very straight and regular in form like most other conifers; but at\r\nthe age of fifty to one hundred years it begins to acquire\r\nindividuality, so that no two are alike in their prime or old age. Every\r\ntree calls for special admiration. I have been making many sketches, and\r\nregret that I cannot draw every needle. It is said to reach a height of\r\nthree hundred feet, though the tallest I have measured falls short of\r\nthis stature sixty feet or more. The diameter of the largest near the\r\nground is about ten feet, though I’ve heard of some twelve feet thick or\r\neven fifteen. The diameter is held to a great height, the taper being\r\nalmost imperceptibly gradual. Its companion, the yellow pine, is almost\r\nas large. The long silvery foliage of the younger specimens forms\r\nmagnificent cylindrical brushes on the top shoots and the ends of the\r\nupturned branches, and when the wind sways the needles all one way at a\r\ncertain angle every tree becomes a tower of white quivering sun-fire.\r\nWell may this shining species be called the silver pine. The needles are\r\nsometimes more than a foot long, almost as long as those of the\r\nlong-leaf pine of Florida. But though in size the yellow pine almost\r\nequals the sugar pine, and in rugged enduring strength seems to surpass\r\nit, it is far less marked in general habit and expression, with its\r\nregular conventional spire and its comparatively small cones clustered\r\nstiffly among the needles. Were there no sugar pine, then would this be\r\nthe king of the world’s eighty or ninety species, the brightest of the\r\nbright, waving, worshiping multitude. Were they mere mechanical\r\nsculptures, what noble objects they would still be! How much more\r\nthrobbing, thrilling, overflowing, full of life in every fiber and cell,\r\ngrand glowing silver-rods—the very gods of the plant kingdom, living\r\ntheir sublime century lives in sight of Heaven, watched and loved and\r\nadmired from generation to generation! And how many other radiant resiny\r\nsun trees are here and higher up,—libocedrus, Douglas spruce, silver\r\nfir, sequoia. How rich our inheritance in these blessed mountains, the\r\ntree pastures into which our eyes are turned!\r\n\r\nNow comes sundown. The west is all a glory of color transfiguring\r\neverything. Far up the Pilot Peak Ridge the radiant host of trees stand\r\nhushed and thoughtful, receiving the Sun’s good-night, as solemn and\r\nimpressive a leave-taking as if sun and trees were to meet no more. The\r\ndaylight fades, the color spell is broken, and the forest breathes free\r\nin the night breeze beneath the stars.\r\n\r\n_June 16._ One of the Indians from Brown’s Flat got right into the\r\nmiddle of the camp this morning, unobserved. I was seated on a stone,\r\nlooking over my notes and sketches, and happening to look up, was\r\nstartled to see him standing grim and silent within a few steps of me,\r\nas motionless and weather-stained as an old tree-stump that had stood\r\nthere for centuries. All Indians seem to have learned this wonderful way\r\nof walking unseen,—making themselves invisible like certain spiders I\r\nhave been observing here, which, in case of alarm, caused, for example,\r\nby a bird alighting on the bush their webs are spread upon, immediately\r\nbounce themselves up and down on their elastic threads so rapidly that\r\nonly a blur is visible. The wild Indian power of escaping observation,\r\neven where there is little or no cover to hide in, was probably slowly\r\nacquired in hard hunting and fighting lessons while trying to approach\r\ngame, take enemies by surprise, or get safely away when compelled to\r\nretreat. And this experience transmitted through many generations seems\r\nat length to have become what is vaguely called instinct.\r\n\r\nHow smooth and changeless seems the surface of the mountains about us!\r\nScarce a track is to be found beyond the range of the sheep except on\r\nsmall open spots on the sides of the streams, or where the forest\r\ncarpets are thin or wanting. On the smoothest of these open strips and\r\npatches deer tracks may be seen, and the great suggestive footprints of\r\nbears, which, with those of the many small animals, are scarce enough to\r\nanswer as a kind of light ornamental stitching or embroidery. Along the\r\nmain ridges and larger branches of the river Indian trails may be\r\ntraced, but they are not nearly as distinct as one would expect to find\r\nthem. How many centuries Indians have roamed these woods nobody knows,\r\nprobably a great many, extending far beyond the time that Columbus\r\ntouched our shores, and it seems strange that heavier marks have not\r\nbeen made. Indians walk softly and hurt the landscape hardly more than\r\nthe birds and squirrels, and their brush and bark huts last hardly\r\nlonger than those of wood rats, while their more enduring monuments,\r\nexcepting those wrought on the forests by the fires they made to improve\r\ntheir hunting grounds, vanish in a few centuries.\r\n\r\nHow different are most of those of the white man, especially on the\r\nlower gold region—roads blasted in the solid rock, wild streams dammed\r\nand tamed and turned out of their channels and led along the sides of\r\ncañons and valleys to work in mines like slaves. Crossing from ridge to\r\nridge, high in the air, on long straddling trestles as if flowing on\r\nstilts, or down and up across valleys and hills, imprisoned in iron\r\npipes to strike and wash away hills and miles of the skin of the\r\nmountain’s face, riddling, stripping every gold gully and flat. These\r\nare the white man’s marks made in a few feverish years, to say nothing\r\nof mills, fields, villages, scattered hundreds of miles along the flank\r\nof the Range. Long will it be ere these marks are effaced, though Nature\r\nis doing what she can, replanting, gardening, sweeping away old dams and\r\nflumes, leveling gravel and boulder piles, patiently trying to heal\r\nevery raw scar. The main gold storm is over. Calm enough are the gray\r\nold miners scratching a bare living in waste diggings here and there.\r\nThundering underground blasting is still going on to feed the pounding\r\nquartz mills, but their influence on the landscape is light as compared\r\nwith that of the pick-and-shovel storms waged a few years ago.\r\nFortunately for Sierra scenery the gold-bearing slates are mostly\r\nrestricted to the foothills. The region about our camp is still wild,\r\nand higher lies the snow about as trackless as the sky.\r\n\r\nOnly a few hills and domes of cloudland were built yesterday and none at\r\nall to-day. The light is peculiarly white and thin, though pleasantly\r\nwarm. The serenity of this mountain weather in the spring, just when\r\nNature’s pulses are beating highest, is one of its greatest charms.\r\nThere is only a moderate breeze from the summits of the Range at night,\r\nand a slight breathing from the sea and the lowland hills and plains\r\nduring the day, or stillness so complete no leaf stirs. The trees\r\nhereabouts have but little wind history to tell.\r\n\r\nSheep, like people, are ungovernable when hungry. Excepting my guarded\r\nlily gardens, almost every leaf that these hoofed locusts can reach\r\nwithin a radius of a mile or two from camp has been devoured. Even the\r\nbushes are stripped bare, and in spite of dogs and shepherds the sheep\r\nscatter to all points of the compass and vanish in dust. I fear some are\r\nlost, for one of the sixteen black ones is missing.\r\n\r\n_June 17._ Counted the wool bundles this morning as they bounced through\r\nthe narrow corral gate. About three hundred are missing, and as the\r\nshepherd could not go to seek them, I had to go. I tied a crust of bread\r\nto my belt, and with Carlo set out for the upper slopes of the Pilot\r\nPeak Ridge, and had a good day, notwithstanding the care of seeking the\r\nsilly runaways. I went out for wool, and did not come back shorn. A\r\npeculiar light circled around the horizon, white and thin like that\r\noften seen over the auroral corona, blending into the blue of the upper\r\nsky. The only clouds were a few faint flossy pencilings like combed\r\nsilk. I pushed direct to the boundary of the usual range of the flock,\r\nand around it until I found the outgoing trail of the wanderers. It led\r\nfar up the ridge into an open place surrounded by a hedge-like growth of\r\nceanothus chaparral. Carlo knew what I was about, and eagerly followed\r\nthe scent until we came up to them, huddled in a timid, silent bunch.\r\nThey had evidently been here all night and all the forenoon, afraid to\r\ngo out to feed. Having escaped restraint, they were, like some people we\r\nknow of, afraid of their freedom, did not know what to do with it, and\r\nseemed glad to get back into the old familiar bondage.\r\n\r\n_June 18._ Another inspiring morning, nothing better in any world can\r\nbe conceived. No description of Heaven that I have ever heard or read of\r\nseems half so fine. At noon the clouds occupied about .05 of the sky,\r\nwhite filmy touches drawn delicately on the azure.\r\n\r\nThe high ridges and hilltops beyond the woolly locusts are now gay with\r\nmonardella, clarkia, coreopsis, and tall tufted grasses, some of them\r\ntall enough to wave like pines. The lupines, of which there are many\r\nill-defined species, are now mostly out of flower, and many of the\r\ncompositæ are beginning to fade, their radiant corollas vanishing in\r\nfluffy pappus like stars in mist.\r\n\r\nWe had another visitor from Brown’s Flat to-day, an old Indian woman\r\nwith a basket on her back. Like our first caller from the village, she\r\ngot fairly into camp and was standing in plain view when discovered. How\r\nlong she had been quietly looking on, I cannot say. Even the dogs failed\r\nto notice her stealthy approach. She was on her way, I suppose, to some\r\nwild garden, probably for lupine and starchy saxifrage leaves and\r\nrootstocks. Her dress was calico rags, far from clean. In every way she\r\nseemed sadly unlike Nature’s neat well-dressed animals, though living\r\nlike them on the bounty of the wilderness. Strange that mankind alone is\r\ndirty. Had she been clad in fur, or cloth woven of grass or shreddy\r\nbark, like the juniper and libocedrus mats, she might then have seemed a\r\nrightful part of the wilderness; like a good wolf at least, or bear. But\r\nfrom no point of view that I have found are such debased fellow beings a\r\nwhit more natural than the glaring tailored tourists we saw that\r\nfrightened the birds and squirrels.\r\n\r\n_June 19._ Pure sunshine all day. How beautiful a rock is made by leaf\r\nshadows! Those of the live oak are particularly clear and distinct, and\r\nbeyond all art in grace and delicacy, now still as if painted on stone,\r\nnow gliding softly as if afraid of noise, now dancing, waltzing in\r\nswift, merry swirls, or jumping on and off sunny rocks in quick dashes\r\nlike wave embroidery on seashore cliffs. How true and substantial is\r\nthis shadow beauty, and with what sublime extravagance is beauty thus\r\nmultiplied! The big orange lilies are now arrayed in all their glory of\r\nleaf and flower. Noble plants, in perfect health, Nature’s darlings.\r\n\r\n_June 20._ Some of the silly sheep got caught fast in a tangle of\r\nchaparral this morning, like flies in a spider’s web, and had to be\r\nhelped out. Carlo found them and tried to drive them from the trap by\r\nthe easiest way. How far above sheep are intelligent dogs! No friend\r\nand helper can be more affectionate and constant than Carlo. The noble\r\nSt. Bernard is an honor to his race.\r\n\r\nThe air is distinctly fragrant with balsam and resin and mint,—every\r\nbreath of it a gift we may well thank God for. Who could ever guess that\r\nso rough a wilderness should yet be so fine, so full of good things. One\r\nseems to be in a majestic domed pavilion in which a grand play is being\r\nacted with scenery and music and incense,—all the furniture and action\r\nso interesting we are in no danger of being called on to endure one dull\r\nmoment. God himself seems to be always doing his best here, working like\r\na man in a glow of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n_June 21._ Sauntered along the river-bank to my lily gardens. The\r\nperfection of beauty in these lilies of the wilderness is a never-ending\r\nsource of admiration and wonder. Their rhizomes are set in black mould\r\naccumulated in hollows of the metamorphic slates beside the pools, where\r\nthey are well watered without being subjected to flood action. Every\r\nleaf in the level whorls around the tall polished stalks is as finely\r\nfinished as the petals, and the light and heat required are measured for\r\nthem and tempered in passing through the branches of over-leaning trees.\r\nHowever strong the winds from the noon rainstorms, they are securely\r\nsheltered. Beautiful hypnum carpets bordered with ferns are spread\r\nbeneath them, violets too, and a few daisies. Everything around them\r\nsweet and fresh like themselves.\r\n\r\nCloudland to-day is only a solitary white mountain; but it is so\r\nenriched with sunshine and shade, the tones of color on its big domed\r\nhead and bossy outbulging ridges, and in the hollows and ravines between\r\nthem, are ineffably fine.\r\n\r\n_June 22._ Unusually cloudy. Besides the periodical shower-bearing\r\ncumuli there is a thin, diffused, fog-like cloud overhead. About .75 in\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_June 23._ Oh, these vast, calm, measureless mountain days, inciting at\r\nonce to work and rest! Days in whose light everything seems equally\r\ndivine, opening a thousand windows to show us God. Nevermore, however\r\nweary, should one faint by the way who gains the blessings of one\r\nmountain day; whatever his fate, long life, short life, stormy or calm,\r\nhe is rich forever.\r\n\r\n_June 24._ Our regular allowance of clouds and thunder. Shepherd Billy\r\nis in a peck of trouble about the sheep; he declares that they are\r\npossessed with more of the evil one than any other flock from the\r\nbeginning of the invention of mutton and wool to the last batch of it.\r\nNo matter how many are missing, he will not, he says, go a step to seek\r\nthem, because, as he reasons, while getting back one wanderer he would\r\nprobably lose ten. Therefore runaway hunting must be Carlo’s and mine.\r\nBilly’s little dog Jack is also giving trouble by leaving camp every\r\nnight to visit his neighbors up the mountain at Brown’s Flat. He is a\r\ncommon-looking cur of no particular breed, but tremendously enterprising\r\nin love and war. He has cut all the ropes and leather straps he has been\r\ntied with, until his master in desperation, after climbing the brushy\r\nmountain again and again to drag him back, fastened him with a pole\r\nattached to his collar under his chin at one end, and to a stout sapling\r\nat the other. But the pole gave good leverage, and by constant twisting\r\nduring the night, the fastening at the sapling end was chafed off, and\r\nhe set out on his usual journey, dragging the pole through the brush,\r\nand reached the Indian settlement in safety. His master followed, and\r\nmaking no allowance, gave him a beating, and swore in bad terms that\r\nnext evening he would “fix that infatuated pup” by anchoring him\r\nunmercifully to the heavy cast-iron lid of our Dutch oven, weighing\r\nabout as much as the dog. It was linked directly to his collar close up\r\nunder the chin, so that the poor fellow seemed unable to stir. He stood\r\nquite discouraged until after dark, unable to look about him, or even to\r\nlie down unless he stretched himself out with his front feet across the\r\nlid, and his head close down between his paws. Before morning, however,\r\nJack was heard far up the height howling Excelsior, cast-iron anchor to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding. He must have walked, or rather climbed,\r\nerect on his hind legs, clasping the heavy lid like a shield against his\r\nbreast, a formidable iron-clad condition in which to meet his rivals.\r\nNext night, dog, pot-lid, and all, were tied up in an old bean-sack, and\r\nthus at last angry Billy gained the victory. Just before leaving home,\r\nJack was bitten in the lower jaw by a rattlesnake, and for a week or so\r\nhis head and neck were swollen to more than double the normal size;\r\nnevertheless he ran about as brisk and lively as ever, and is now\r\ncompletely recovered. The only treatment he got was fresh milk—a gallon\r\nor two at a time forcibly poured down his sore, poisoned throat.\r\n\r\n_June 25._ Though only a sheep camp, this grand mountain hollow is home,\r\nsweet home, every day growing sweeter, and I shall be sorry to leave it.\r\nThe lily gardens are safe as yet from the trampling flock. Poor, dusty,\r\nraggedy, famishing creatures, I heartily pity them. Many a mile they\r\nmust go every day to gather their fifteen or twenty tons of chaparral\r\nand grass.\r\n\r\n_June 26._ Nuttall’s flowering dogwood makes a fine show when in bloom.\r\nThe whole tree is then snowy white. The involucres are six to eight\r\ninches wide. Along the streams it is a good-sized tree thirty to fifty\r\nfeet high, with a broad head when not crowded by companions. Its showy\r\ninvolucres attract a crowd of moths, butterflies, and other winged\r\npeople about it for their own and, I suppose, the tree’s advantage. It\r\nlikes plenty of cool water, and is a great drinker like the alder,\r\nwillow, and cottonwood, and flourishes best on stream banks, though it\r\noften wanders far from streams in damp shady glens beneath the pines,\r\nwhere it is much smaller. When the leaves ripen in the fall, they become\r\nmore beautiful than the flowers, displaying charming tones of red,\r\npurple, and lavender. Another species grows in abundance as a chaparral\r\nshrub on the shady sides of the hills, probably _Cornus sessilis_. The\r\nleaves are eaten by the sheep.—Heard a few lightning strokes in the\r\ndistance, with rumbling, mumbling reverberations.\r\n\r\n_June 27._ The beaked hazel (_Corylus rostrata_, var. _Californica_) is\r\ncommon on cool slopes up toward the summit of the Pilot Peak Ridge.\r\nThere is something peculiarly attractive in the hazel, like the oaks and\r\nheaths of the cool countries of our forefathers, and through them our\r\nlove for these plants has, I suppose, been transmitted. This species is\r\nfour or five feet high, leaves soft and hairy, grateful to the touch,\r\nand the delicious nuts are eagerly gathered by Indians and squirrels.\r\nThe sky as usual adorned with white noon clouds.\r\n\r\n_June 28._ Warm, mellow summer. The glowing sunbeams make every nerve\r\ntingle. The new needles of the pines and firs are nearly full grown and\r\nshine gloriously. Lizards are glinting about on the hot rocks; some that\r\nlive near the camp are more than half tame. They seem attentive to every\r\nmovement on our part, as if curious to simply look on without suspicion\r\nof harm, turning their heads to look back, and making a variety of\r\npretty gestures. Gentle, guileless creatures with beautiful eyes, I\r\nshall be sorry to leave them when we leave camp.\r\n\r\n_June 29._ I have been making the acquaintance of a very interesting\r\nlittle bird that flits about the falls and rapids of the main branches\r\nof the river. It is not a water-bird in structure, though it gets its\r\nliving in the water, and never leaves the streams. It is not web-footed,\r\nyet it dives fearlessly into deep swirling rapids, evidently to feed at\r\nthe bottom, using its wings to swim with under water just as ducks and\r\nloons do. Sometimes it wades about in shallow places, thrusting its head\r\nunder from time to time in a jerking, nodding, frisky way that is sure\r\nto attract attention. It is about the size of a robin, has short crisp\r\nwings serviceable for flying either in water or air, and a tail of\r\nmoderate size slanted upward, giving it, with its nodding, bobbing\r\nmanners, a wrennish look. Its color is plain bluish ash, with a tinge of\r\nbrown on the head and shoulders. It flies from fall to fall, rapid to\r\nrapid, with a solid whir of wing-beats like those of a quail, follows\r\nthe windings of the stream, and usually alights on some rock jutting up\r\nout of the current, or on some stranded snag, or rarely on the dry limb\r\nof an overhanging tree, perching like regular tree birds when it suits\r\nits convenience. It has the oddest, daintiest mincing manners\r\nimaginable; and the little fellow can sing too, a sweet, thrushy, fluty\r\nsong, rather low, not the least boisterous, and much less keen and\r\naccentuated than from its vigorous briskness one would be led to look\r\nfor. What a romantic life this little bird leads on the most beautiful\r\nportions of the streams, in a genial climate with shade and cool water\r\nand spray to temper the summer heat. No wonder it is a fine singer,\r\nconsidering the stream songs it hears day and night. Every breath the\r\nlittle poet draws is part of a song, for all the air about the rapids\r\nand falls is beaten into music, and its first lessons must begin before\r\nit is born by the thrilling and quivering of the eggs in unison with the\r\ntones of the falls. I have not yet found its nest, but it must be near\r\nthe streams, for it never leaves them.\r\n\r\n_June 30._ Half cloudy, half sunny, clouds lustrous white. The tall\r\npines crowded along the top of the Pilot Peak Ridge look like six-inch\r\nminiatures exquisitely outlined on the satiny sky. Average cloudiness\r\nfor the day about .25. No rain. And so this memorable month ends, a\r\nstream of beauty unmeasured, no more to be sectioned off by almanac\r\narithmetic than sun-radiance or the currents of seas and rivers—a\r\npeaceful, joyful stream of beauty. Every morning, arising from the death\r\nof sleep, the happy plants and all our fellow animal creatures great and\r\nsmall, and even the rocks, seemed to be shouting, “Awake, awake,\r\nrejoice, rejoice, come love us and join in our song. Come! Come!”\r\nLooking back through the stillness and romantic enchanting beauty and\r\npeace of the camp grove, this June seems the greatest of all the months\r\nof my life, the most truly, divinely free, boundless like eternity,\r\nimmortal. Everything in it seems equally divine—one smooth, pure, wild\r\nglow of Heaven’s love, never to be blotted or blurred by anything past\r\nor to come.\r\n\r\n_July 1._ Summer is ripe. Flocks of seeds are already out of their cups\r\nand pods seeking their predestined places. Some will strike root and\r\ngrow up beside their parents, others flying on the wings of the wind far\r\nfrom them, among strangers. Most of the young birds are full feathered\r\nand out of their nests, though still looked after by both father and\r\nmother, protected and fed and to some extent educated. How beautiful the\r\nhome life of birds! No wonder we all love them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUGLAS SQUIRREL OBSERVING BROTHER MAN]\r\n\r\nI like to watch the squirrels. There are two species here, the large\r\nCalifornia gray and the Douglas. The latter is the brightest of all the\r\nsquirrels I have ever seen, a hot spark of life, making every tree\r\ntingle with his prickly toes, a condensed nugget of fresh mountain vigor\r\nand valor, as free from disease as a sunbeam. One cannot think of such\r\nan animal ever being weary or sick. He seems to think the mountains\r\nbelong to him, and at first tried to drive away the whole flock of\r\nsheep as well as the shepherd and dogs. How he scolds, and what faces he\r\nmakes, all eyes, teeth, and whiskers! If not so comically small, he\r\nwould indeed be a dreadful fellow. I should like to know more about his\r\nbringing up, his life in the home knot-hole, as well as in the\r\ntree-tops, throughout all seasons. Strange that I have not yet found a\r\nnest full of young ones. The Douglas is nearly allied to the red\r\nsquirrel of the Atlantic slope, and may have been distributed to this\r\nside of the continent by way of the great unbroken forests of the north.\r\n\r\nThe California gray is one of the most beautiful, and, next to the\r\nDouglas, the most interesting of our hairy neighbors. Compared with the\r\nDouglas he is twice as large, but far less lively and influential as a\r\nworker in the woods and he manages to make his way through leaves and\r\nbranches with less stir than his small brother. I have never heard him\r\nbark at anything except our dogs. When in search of food he glides\r\nsilently from branch to branch, examining last year’s cones, to see\r\nwhether some few seeds may not be left between the scales, or gleans\r\nfallen ones among the leaves on the ground, since none of the present\r\nseason’s crop is yet available. His tail floats now behind him, now\r\nabove him, level or gracefully curled like a wisp of cirrus cloud,\r\nevery hair in its place, clean and shining and radiant as thistle-down\r\nin spite of rough, gummy work. His whole body seems about as\r\nunsubstantial as his tail. The little Douglas is fiery, peppery, full of\r\nbrag and fight and show, with movements so quick and keen they almost\r\nsting the onlooker, and the harlequin gyrating show he makes of himself\r\nturns one giddy to see. The gray is shy, and oftentimes stealthy in his\r\nmovements, as if half expecting an enemy in every tree and bush, and\r\nback of every log, wishing only to be let alone apparently, and\r\nmanifesting no desire to be seen or admired or feared. The Indians hunt\r\nthis species for food, a good cause for caution, not to mention other\r\nenemies—hawks, snakes, wild cats. In woods where food is abundant they\r\nwear paths through sheltering thickets and over prostrate trees to some\r\nfavorite pool where in hot and dry weather they drink at nearly the same\r\nhour every day. These pools are said to be narrowly watched, especially\r\nby the boys, who lie in ambush with bow and arrow, and kill without\r\nnoise. But, in spite of enemies, squirrels are happy fellows, forest\r\nfavorites, types of tireless life. Of all Nature’s wild beasts, they\r\nseem to me the wildest. May we come to know each other better.\r\n\r\nThe chaparral-covered hill-slope to the south of the camp, besides\r\nfurnishing nesting-places for countless merry birds, is the home and\r\nhiding-place of the curious wood rat (_Neotoma_), a handsome,\r\ninteresting animal, always attracting attention wherever seen. It is\r\nmore like a squirrel than a rat, is much larger, has delicate, thick,\r\nsoft fur of a bluish slate color, white on the belly; ears large, thin,\r\nand translucent; eyes soft, full, and liquid; claws slender, sharp as\r\nneedles; and as his limbs are strong, he can climb about as well as a\r\nsquirrel. No rat or squirrel has so innocent a look, is so easily\r\napproached, or expresses such confidence in one’s good intentions. He\r\nseems too fine for the thorny thickets he inhabits, and his hut also is\r\nas unlike himself as may be, though softly furnished inside. No other\r\nanimal inhabitant of these mountains builds houses so large and striking\r\nin appearance. The traveler coming suddenly upon a group of them for the\r\nfirst time will not be likely to forget them. They are built of all\r\nkinds of sticks, old rotten pieces picked up anywhere, and green prickly\r\ntwigs bitten from the nearest bushes, the whole mixed with miscellaneous\r\nodds and ends of everything movable, such as bits of cloddy earth,\r\nstones, bones, deerhorn, etc., piled up in a conical mass as if it were\r\ngot ready for burning. Some of these curious cabins are six feet high\r\nand as wide at the base, and a dozen or more of them are occasionally\r\ngrouped together, less perhaps for the sake of society than for\r\nadvantages of food and shelter. Coming through the dense shaggy thickets\r\nof some lonely hillside, the solitary explorer happening into one of\r\nthese strange villages is startled at the sight, and may fancy himself\r\nin an Indian settlement, and begin to wonder what kind of reception he\r\nis likely to get. But no savage face will he see, perhaps not a single\r\ninhabitant, or at most two or three seated on top of their wigwams,\r\nlooking at the stranger with the mildest of wild eyes, and allowing a\r\nnear approach. In the centre of the rough spiky hut a soft nest is made\r\nof the inner fibres of bark chewed to tow, and lined with feathers and\r\nthe down of various seeds, such as willow and milkweed. The delicate\r\ncreature in its prickly, thick-walled home suggests a tender flower in a\r\nthorny involucre. Some of the nests are built in trees thirty or forty\r\nfeet from the ground, and even in garrets, as if seeking the company and\r\nprotection of man, like swallows and linnets, though accustomed to the\r\nwildest solitude. Among housekeepers Neotoma has the reputation of a\r\nthief, because he carries away everything transportable to his queer\r\nhut,—knives, forks, combs, nails, tin cups, spectacles, etc.,—merely,\r\nhowever, to strengthen his fortifications, I guess. His food at home, as\r\nfar as I have learned, is nearly the same as that of the\r\nsquirrels,—nuts, berries, seeds, and sometimes the bark and tender\r\nshoots of the various species of ceanothus.\r\n\r\n_July 2._ Warm, sunny day, thrilling plant and animals and rocks alike,\r\nmaking sap and blood flow fast, and making every particle of the crystal\r\nmountains throb and swirl and dance in glad accord like star-dust. No\r\ndullness anywhere visible or thinkable. No stagnation, no death.\r\nEverything kept in joyful rhythmic motion in the pulses of Nature’s big\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nPearl cumuli over the higher mountains—clouds, not with a silver\r\nlining, but all silver. The brightest, crispest, rockiest-looking\r\nclouds, most varied in features and keenest in outline I ever saw at any\r\ntime of year in any country. The daily building and unbuilding of these\r\nsnowy cloud-ranges—the highest Sierra—is a prime marvel to me, and I\r\ngaze at the stupendous white domes, miles high, with ever fresh\r\nadmiration. But in the midst of these sky and mountain affairs a change\r\nof diet is pulling us down. We have been out of bread a few days, and\r\nbegin to miss it more than seems reasonable for we have plenty of meat\r\nand sugar and tea. Strange we should feel food-poor in so rich a\r\nwilderness. The Indians put us to shame, so do the squirrels,—starchy\r\nroots and seeds and bark in abundance, yet the failure of the meal sack\r\ndisturbs our bodily balance, and threatens our best enjoyments.\r\n\r\n_July 3._ Warm. Breeze just enough to sift through the woods and waft\r\nfragrance from their thousand fountains. The pine and fir cones are\r\ngrowing well, resin and balsam dripping from every tree, and seeds are\r\nripening fast, promising a fine harvest. The squirrels will have bread.\r\nThey eat all kinds of nuts long before they are ripe, and yet never seem\r\nto suffer in stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA BREAD FAMINE\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 4._ The air beyond the flock range, full of the essences of the\r\nwoods, is growing sweeter and more fragrant from day to day, like\r\nripening fruit.\r\n\r\nMr. Delaney is expected to arrive soon from the lowlands with a new\r\nstock of provisions, and as the flock is to be moved to fresh pastures\r\nwe shall all be well fed. In the mean time our stock of beans as well as\r\nflour has failed—everything but mutton, sugar, and tea. The shepherd is\r\nsomewhat demoralized, and seems to care but little what becomes of his\r\nflock. He says that since the boss has failed to feed him he is not\r\nrightly bound to feed the sheep, and swears that no decent white man can\r\nclimb these steep mountains on mutton alone. “It’s not fittin’ grub for\r\na white man really white. For dogs and coyotes and Indians it’s\r\ndifferent. Good grub, good sheep. That’s what I say.” Such was Billy’s\r\nFourth of July oration.\r\n\r\n_July 5._ The clouds of noon on the high Sierra seem yet more\r\nmarvelously, indescribably beautiful from day to day as one becomes\r\nmore wakeful to see them. The smoke of the gunpowder burned yesterday on\r\nthe lowlands, and the eloquence of the orators has probably settled or\r\nbeen blown away by this time. Here every day is a holiday, a jubilee\r\never sounding with serene enthusiasm, without wear or waste or cloying\r\nweariness. Everything rejoicing. Not a single cell or crystal unvisited\r\nor forgotten.\r\n\r\n_July 6._ Mr. Delaney has not arrived, and the bread famine is sore. We\r\nmust eat mutton a while longer, though it seems hard to get accustomed\r\nto it. I have heard of Texas pioneers living without bread or anything\r\nmade from the cereals for months without suffering, using the\r\nbreast-meat of wild turkeys for bread. Of this kind they had plenty in\r\nthe good old days when life, though considered less safe, was fussed\r\nover the less. The trappers and fur traders of early days in the Rocky\r\nMountain regions lived on bison and beaver meat for months.\r\nSalmon-eaters, too, there are among both Indians and whites who seem to\r\nsuffer little or not at all from the want of bread. Just at this moment\r\nmutton seems the least desirable of food, though of good quality. We\r\npick out the leanest bits, and down they go against heavy disgust,\r\ncausing nausea and an effort to reject the offensive stuff. Tea makes\r\nmatters worse, if possible. The stomach begins to assert itself as an\r\nindependent creature with a will of its own. We should boil lupine\r\nleaves, clover, starchy petioles, and saxifrage rootstocks like the\r\nIndians. We try to ignore our gastric troubles, rise and gaze about us,\r\nturn our eyes to the mountains, and climb doggedly up through brush and\r\nrocks into the heart of the scenery. A stifled calm comes on, and the\r\nday’s duties and even enjoyments are languidly got through with. We chew\r\na few leaves of ceanothus by way of luncheon, and smell or chew the\r\nspicy monardella for the dull headache and stomach-ache that now\r\nlightens, now comes muffling down upon us and into us like fog. At night\r\nmore mutton, flesh to flesh, down with it, not too much, and there are\r\nthe stars shining through the cedar plumes and branches above our beds.\r\n\r\n_July 7._ Rather weak and sickish this morning, and all about a piece of\r\nbread. Can scarce command attention to my best studies, as if one\r\ncouldn’t take a few days’ saunter in the Godful woods without\r\nmaintaining a base on a wheat-field and gristmill. Like caged parrots we\r\nwant a cracker, any of the hundred kinds—the remainder biscuit of a\r\nvoyage around the world would answer well enough, nor would the\r\nwholesomeness of saleratus biscuit be questioned. Bread without flesh\r\nis a good diet, as on many botanical excursions I have proved. Tea also\r\nmay easily be ignored. Just bread and water and delightful toil is all I\r\nneed,—not unreasonably much, yet one ought to be trained and tempered\r\nto enjoy life in these brave wilds in full independence of any\r\nparticular kind of nourishment. That this may be accomplished is\r\nmanifest, as far as bodily welfare is concerned, in the lives of people\r\nof other climes. The Eskimo, for example, gets a living far north of the\r\nwheat line, from oily seals and whales. Meat, berries, bitter weeds, and\r\nblubber, or only the last, for months at a time; and yet these people\r\nall around the frozen shores of our continent are said to be hearty,\r\njolly, stout, and brave. We hear, too, of fish-eaters, carnivorous as\r\nspiders, yet well enough as far as stomachs are concerned, while we are\r\nso ridiculously helpless, making wry faces over our fare, looking\r\nsheepish in digestive distress amid rumbling, grumbling sounds that\r\nmight well pass for smothered baas. We have a large supply of sugar, and\r\nthis evening it occurred to me that these belligerent stomachs might\r\npossibly, like complaining children, be coaxed with candy. Accordingly\r\nthe frying-pan was cleansed, and a lot of sugar cooked in it to a sort\r\nof wax, but this stuff only made matters worse.\r\n\r\nMan seems to be the only animal whose food soils him, making necessary\r\nmuch washing and shield-like bibs and napkins. Moles living in the earth\r\nand eating slimy worms are yet as clean as seals or fishes, whose lives\r\nare one perpetual wash. And, as we have seen, the squirrels in these\r\nresiny woods keep themselves clean in some mysterious way; not a hair is\r\nsticky, though they handle the gummy cones, and glide about apparently\r\nwithout care. The birds, too, are clean, though they seem to make a good\r\ndeal of fuss washing and cleaning their feathers. Certain flies and ants\r\nI see are in a fix, entangled and sealed up in the sugar-wax we threw\r\naway, like some of their ancestors in amber. Our stomachs, like tired\r\nmuscles, are sore with long squirming. Once I was very hungry in the\r\nBonaventure graveyard near Savannah, Georgia, having fasted for several\r\ndays; then the empty stomach seemed to chafe in much the same way as\r\nnow, and a somewhat similar tenderness and aching was produced, hard to\r\nbear, though the pain was not acute. We dream of bread, a sure sign we\r\nneed it. Like the Indians, we ought to know how to get the starch out of\r\nfern and saxifrage stalks, lily bulbs, pine bark, etc. Our education has\r\nbeen sadly neglected for many generations. Wild rice would be good. I\r\nnoticed a leersia in wet meadow edges, but the seeds are small. Acorns\r\nare not ripe, nor pine nuts, nor filberts. The inner bark of pine or\r\nspruce might be tried. Drank tea until half intoxicated. Man seems to\r\ncrave a stimulant when anything extraordinary is going on, and this is\r\nthe only one I use. Billy chews great quantities of tobacco, which I\r\nsuppose helps to stupefy and moderate his misery. We look and listen for\r\nthe Don every hour. How beautiful upon the mountains his big feet would\r\nbe!\r\n\r\nIn the warm, hospitable Sierra, shepherds and mountain men in general,\r\nas far as I have seen, are easily satisfied as to food supplies and\r\nbedding. Most of them are heartily content to “rough it,” ignoring\r\nNature’s fineness as bothersome or unmanly. The shepherd’s bed is often\r\nonly the bare ground and a pair of blankets, with a stone, a piece of\r\nwood, or a pack-saddle for a pillow. In choosing the spot, he shows less\r\ncare than the dogs, for they usually deliberate before making up their\r\nminds in so important an affair, going from place to place, scraping\r\naway loose sticks and pebbles, and trying for comfort by making many\r\nchanges, while the shepherd casts himself down anywhere, seemingly the\r\nleast skilled of all rest seekers. His food, too, even when he has all\r\nhe wants, is usually far from delicate, either in kind or cooking.\r\nBeans, bread of any sort, bacon, mutton, dried peaches, and sometimes\r\npotatoes and onions, make up his bill-of-fare, the two latter articles\r\nbeing regarded as luxuries on account of their weight as compared with\r\nthe nourishment they contain; a half-sack or so of each may be put into\r\nthe pack in setting out from the home ranch and in a few days they are\r\ndone. Beans are the main standby, portable, wholesome, and capable of\r\ngoing far, besides being easily cooked, although curiously enough a\r\ngreat deal of mystery is supposed to lie about the bean-pot. No two\r\ncooks quite agree on the methods of making beans do their best, and,\r\nafter petting and coaxing and nursing the savory mess,—well oiled and\r\nmellowed with bacon boiled into the heart of it,—the proud cook will\r\nask, after dishing out a quart or two for trial, “Well, how do you like\r\n_my_ beans?” as if by no possibility could they be like any other beans\r\ncooked in the same way, but must needs possess some special virtue of\r\nwhich he alone is master. Molasses, sugar, or pepper may be used to give\r\ndesired flavors; or the first water may be poured off and a spoonful or\r\ntwo of ashes or soda added to dissolve or soften the skins more fully,\r\naccording to various tastes and notions. But, like casks of wine, no two\r\npotfuls are exactly alike to every palate. Some are supposed to be\r\nspoiled by the moon, by some unlucky day, by the beans having been grown\r\non soil not suitable; or the whole year may be to blame as not favorable\r\nfor beans.\r\n\r\nCoffee, too, has its marvels in the camp kitchen, but not so many, and\r\nnot so inscrutable as those that beset the bean-pot. A low, complacent\r\ngrunt follows a mouthful drawn in with a gurgle, and the remark cast\r\nforth aimlessly, “That’s good coffee.” Then another gurgling sip and\r\nrepetition of the judgment, “_Yes, sir_, that _is_ good coffee.” As to\r\ntea, there are but two kinds, weak and strong, the stronger the better.\r\nThe only remark heard is, “That tea’s weak,” otherwise it is good enough\r\nand not worth mentioning. If it has been boiled an hour or two or smoked\r\non a pitchy fire, no matter,—who cares for a little tannin or creosote?\r\nthey make the black beverage all the stronger and more attractive to\r\ntobacco-tanned palates.\r\n\r\nSheep-camp bread, like most California camp bread, is baked in Dutch\r\novens, some of it in the form of yeast powder biscuit, an unwholesome\r\nsticky compound leading straight to dyspepsia. The greater part,\r\nhowever, is fermented with sour dough, a handful from each batch being\r\nsaved and put away in the mouth of the flour sack to inoculate the\r\nnext. The oven is simply a cast-iron pot, about five inches deep and\r\nfrom twelve to eighteen inches wide. After the batch has been mixed and\r\nkneaded in a tin pan the oven is slightly heated and rubbed with a piece\r\nof tallow or pork rind. The dough is then placed in it, pressed out\r\nagainst the sides, and left to rise. When ready for baking a shovelful\r\nof coals is spread out by the side of the fire and the oven set upon\r\nthem, while another shovelful is placed on top of the lid, which is\r\nraised from time to time to see that the requisite amount of heat is\r\nbeing kept up. With care good bread may be made in this way, though it\r\nis liable to be burned or to be sour, or raised too much, and the weight\r\nof the oven is a serious objection.\r\n\r\nAt last Don Delaney comes doon the lang glen—hunger vanishes, we turn\r\nour eyes to the mountains, and to-morrow we go climbing toward\r\ncloudland.\r\n\r\nNever while anything is left of me shall this first camp be forgotten.\r\nIt has fairly grown into me, not merely as memory pictures, but as part\r\nand parcel of mind and body alike. The deep hopper-like hollow, with its\r\nmajestic trees through which all the wonderful nights the stars poured\r\ntheir beauty. The flowery wildness of the high steep slope toward\r\nBrown’s Flat, and its bloom-fragrance descending at the close of the\r\nstill days. The embowered river-reaches with their multitude of voices\r\nmaking melody, the stately flow and rush and glad exulting onsweeping\r\ncurrents caressing the dipping sedge-leaves and bushes and mossy stones,\r\nswirling in pools, dividing against little flowery islands, breaking\r\ngray and white here and there, ever rejoicing, yet with deep solemn\r\nundertones recalling the ocean—the brave little bird ever beside them,\r\nsinging with sweet human tones among the waltzing foam-bells, and like a\r\nblessed evangel explaining God’s love. And the Pilot Peak Ridge, its\r\nlong withdrawing slopes gracefully modeled and braided, reaching from\r\nclimate to climate, feathered with trees that are the kings of their\r\nrace, their ranks nobly marshaled to view, spire above spire, crown\r\nabove crown, waving their long, leafy arms, tossing their cones like\r\nringing bells—blessed sun-fed mountaineers rejoicing in their strength,\r\nevery tree tuneful, a harp for the winds and the sun. The hazel and\r\nbuckthorn pastures of the deer, the sun-beaten brows purple and yellow\r\nwith mint and golden-rods, carpeted with chamæbatia, humming with bees.\r\nAnd the dawns and sunrises and sundowns of these mountain days,—the\r\nrose light creeping higher among the stars, changing to daffodil yellow,\r\nthe level beams bursting forth, streaming across the ridges, touching\r\npine after pine, awakening and warming all the mighty host to do gladly\r\ntheir shining day’s work. The great sun-gold noons, the alabaster\r\ncloud-mountains, the landscape beaming with consciousness like the face\r\nof a god. The sunsets, when the trees stood hushed awaiting their\r\ngood-night blessings. Divine, enduring, unwastable wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTO THE HIGH MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 8._ Now away we go toward the topmost mountains. Many still, small\r\nvoices, as well as the noon thunder, are calling, “Come higher.”\r\nFarewell, blessed dell, woods, gardens, streams, birds, squirrels,\r\nlizards, and a thousand others. Farewell. Farewell.\r\n\r\nUp through the woods the hoofed locusts streamed beneath a cloud of\r\nbrown dust. Scarcely were they driven a hundred yards from the old\r\ncorral ere they seemed to know that at last they were going to new\r\npastures, and rushed wildly ahead, crowding through gaps in the brush,\r\njumping, tumbling like exulting hurrahing flood-waters escaping through\r\na broken dam. A man on each flank kept shouting advice to the leaders,\r\nwho in their famishing condition were behaving like Gadarene swine; two\r\nother drivers were busy with stragglers, helping them out of brush\r\ntangles; the Indian, calm, alert, silently watched for wanderers likely\r\nto be overlooked; the two dogs ran here and there, at a loss to know\r\nwhat was best to be done, while the Don, soon far in the rear, was\r\ntrying to keep in sight of his troublesome wealth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TUOLUMNE AND THE MERCED BELOW HAZEL\r\nGREEN]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boundary of the old eaten-out range was passed the hungry\r\nhorde suddenly became calm, like a mountain stream in a meadow.\r\nThenceforward they were allowed to eat their way as slowly as they\r\nwished, care being taken only to keep them headed toward the summit of\r\nthe Merced and Tuolumne divide. Soon the two thousand flattened paunches\r\nwere bulged out with sweet-pea vines and grass, and the gaunt, desperate\r\ncreatures, more like wolves than sheep, became bland and governable,\r\nwhile the howling drivers changed to gentle shepherds, and sauntered in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nToward sundown we reached Hazel Green, a charming spot on the summit of\r\nthe dividing ridge between the basins of the Merced and Tuolumne, where\r\nthere is a small brook flowing through hazel and dogwood thickets\r\nbeneath magnificent silver firs and pines. Here, we are camped for the\r\nnight, our big fire, heaped high with rosiny logs and branches, is\r\nblazing like a sunrise, gladly giving back the light slowly sifted from\r\nthe sunbeams of centuries of summers; and in the glow of that old\r\nsunlight how impressively surrounding objects are brought forward in\r\nrelief against the outer darkness! Grasses, larkspurs, columbines,\r\nlilies, hazel bushes, and the great trees form a circle around the fire\r\nlike thoughtful spectators, gazing and listening with human-like\r\nenthusiasm. The night breeze is cool, for all day we have been climbing\r\ninto the upper sky, the home of the cloud mountains we so long have\r\nadmired. How sweet and keen the air! Every breath a blessing. Here the\r\nsugar pine reaches its fullest development in size and beauty and number\r\nof individuals, filling every swell and hollow and down-plunging ravine\r\nalmost to the exclusion of other species. A few yellow pines are still\r\nto be found as companions, and in the coolest places silver firs; but\r\nnoble as these are, the sugar pine is king, and spreads long protecting\r\narms above them while they rock and wave in sign of recognition.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a height of six thousand feet. In the forenoon we\r\npassed along a flat part of the dividing ridge that is planted with\r\nmanzanita (_Arctostaphylos_), some specimens the largest I have seen. I\r\nmeasured one, the bole of which is four feet in diameter and only\r\neighteen inches high from the ground, where it dissolves into many\r\nwide-spreading branches forming a broad round head about ten or twelve\r\nfeet high, covered with clusters of small narrow-throated pink bells.\r\nThe leaves are pale green, glandular, and set on edge by a twist of the\r\npetiole. The branches seem naked; for the chocolate-colored bark is very\r\nsmooth and thin, and is shed off in flakes that curl when dry. The wood\r\nis red, close-grained, hard, and heavy. I wonder how old these curious\r\ntree-bushes are, probably as old as the great pines. Indians and bears\r\nand birds and fat grubs feast on the berries, which look like small\r\napples, often rosy on one side, green on the other. The Indians are said\r\nto make a kind of beer or cider out of them. There are many species.\r\nThis one, _Arctostaphylos pungens_, is common hereabouts. No need have\r\nthey to fear the wind, so low they are and steadfastly rooted. Even the\r\nfires that sweep the woods seldom destroy them utterly, for they rise\r\nagain from the root, and some of the dry ridges they grow on are seldom\r\ntouched by fire. I must try to know them better.\r\n\r\nI miss my river songs to-night. Here Hazel Creek at its topmost springs\r\nhas a voice like a bird. The wind-tones in the great trees overhead are\r\nstrangely impressive, all the more because not a leaf stirs below them.\r\nBut it grows late, and I must to bed. The camp is silent; everybody\r\nasleep. It seems extravagant to spend hours so precious in sleep. “He\r\ngiveth his beloved sleep.” Pity the poor beloved needs it, weak, weary,\r\nforspent; oh, the pity of it, to sleep in the midst of eternal,\r\nbeautiful motion instead of gazing forever, like the stars.\r\n\r\n_July 9._ Exhilarated with the mountain air, I feel like shouting this\r\nmorning with excess of wild animal joy. The Indian lay down away from\r\nthe fire last night, without blankets, having nothing on, by way of\r\nclothing, but a pair of blue overalls and a calico shirt wet with sweat.\r\nThe night air is chilly at this elevation, and we gave him some\r\nhorse-blankets, but he didn’t seem to care for them. A fine thing to be\r\nindependent of clothing where it is so hard to carry. When food is\r\nscarce, he can live on whatever comes in his way—a few berries, roots,\r\nbird eggs, grasshoppers, black ants, fat wasp or bumblebee larvæ,\r\nwithout feeling that he is doing anything worth mention, so I have been\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Silver Fir, or Red Fir (Abies magnifica)_]\r\n\r\nOur course to-day was along the broad top of the main ridge to a hollow\r\nbeyond Crane Flat. It is scarce at all rocky, and is covered with the\r\nnoblest pines and spruces I have yet seen. Sugar pines from six to eight\r\nfeet in diameter are not uncommon, with a height of two hundred feet or\r\neven more. The silver firs (_Abies concolor_ and _A. magnifica_) are\r\nexceedingly beautiful, especially the _magnifica_, which becomes\r\nmore abundant the higher we go. It is of great size, one of the most\r\nnotable in every way of the giant conifers of the Sierra. I saw\r\nspecimens that measured seven feet in diameter and over two hundred feet\r\nin height, while the average size for what might be called full-grown\r\nmature trees can hardly be less than one hundred and eighty or two\r\nhundred feet high and five or six feet in diameter; and with these noble\r\ndimensions there is a symmetry and perfection of finish not to be seen\r\nin any other tree, hereabout at least. The branches are whorled in fives\r\nmostly, and stand out from the tall, straight, exquisitely tapered bole\r\nin level collars, each branch regularly pinnated like the fronds of\r\nferns, and densely clad with leaves all around the branchlets, thus\r\ngiving them a singularly rich and sumptuous appearance. The extreme top\r\nof the tree is a thick blunt shoot pointing straight to the zenith like\r\nan admonishing finger. The cones stand erect like casks on the upper\r\nbranches. They are about six inches long, three in diameter, blunt,\r\nvelvety, and cylindrical in form, and very rich and precious looking.\r\nThe seeds are about three quarters of an inch long, dark reddish brown\r\nwith brilliant iridescent purple wings, and when ripe, the cone falls\r\nto pieces, and the seeds thus set free at a height of one hundred and\r\nfifty or two hundred feet have a good send off and may fly considerable\r\ndistances in a good breeze; and it is when a good breeze is blowing that\r\nmost of them are shaken free to fly.\r\n\r\nThe other species, _Abies concolor_, attains nearly as great a height\r\nand thickness as the _magnifica_, but the branches do not form such\r\nregular whorls, nor are they so exactly pinnated or richly leaf-clad.\r\nInstead of growing all around the branchlets, the leaves are mostly\r\narranged in two flat horizontal rows. The cones and seeds are like those\r\nof the _magnifica_ in form but less than half as large. The bark of the\r\n_magnifica_ is reddish purple and closely furrowed, that of the\r\n_concolor_ gray and widely furrowed. A noble pair.\r\n\r\nAt Crane Flat we climbed a thousand feet or more in a distance of about\r\ntwo miles, the forest growing more dense and the silvery _magnifica_ fir\r\nforming a still greater portion of the whole. Crane Flat is a meadow\r\nwith a wide sandy border lying on the top of the divide. It is often\r\nvisited by blue cranes to rest and feed on their long journeys, hence\r\nthe name. It is about half a mile long, draining into the Merced, sedgy\r\nin the middle, with a margin bright with lilies, columbines, larkspurs,\r\nlupines, castilleia, then an outer zone of dry, gently sloping ground\r\nstarred with a multitude of small flowers,—eunanus, mimulus, gilia,\r\nwith rosettes of spraguea, and tufts of several species of eriogonum and\r\nthe brilliant zauschneria. The noble forest wall about it is made up of\r\nthe two silver firs and the yellow and sugar pines, which here seem to\r\nreach their highest pitch of beauty and grandeur; for the elevation, six\r\nthousand feet or a little more, is not too great for the sugar and\r\nyellow pines or too low for the _magnifica_ fir, while the _concolor_\r\nseems to find this elevation the best possible. About a mile from the\r\nnorth end of the flat there is a grove of _Sequoia gigantea_, the king\r\nof all the conifers. Furthermore, the Douglas spruce (_Pseudotsuga\r\nDouglasii_) and _Libocedrus decurrens_, and a few two-leaved pines,\r\noccur here and there, forming a small part of the forest. Three pines,\r\ntwo silver firs, one Douglas spruce, one sequoia,—all of them, except\r\nthe two-leaved pine, colossal trees,—are found here together, an\r\nassemblage of conifers unrivaled on the globe.\r\n\r\nWe passed a number of charming garden-like meadows lying on top of the\r\ndivide or hanging like ribbons down its sides, imbedded in the glorious\r\nforest. Some are taken up chiefly with the tall white-flowered _Veratrum\r\nCalifornicum_, with boat-shaped leaves about a foot long, eight or ten\r\ninches wide, and veined like those of cypripedium,—a robust, hearty,\r\nliliaceous plant, fond of water and determined to be seen. Columbine and\r\nlarkspur grow on the dryer edges of the meadows, with a tall handsome\r\nlupine standing waist-deep in long grasses and sedges. Castilleias, too,\r\nof several species make a bright show with beds of violets at their\r\nfeet. But the glory of these forest meadows is a lily (_L. parvum_). The\r\ntallest are from seven to eight feet high with magnificent racemes of\r\nten to twenty or more small orange-colored flowers; they stand out free\r\nin open ground, with just enough grass and other companion plants about\r\nthem to fringe their feet, and show them off to best advantage. This is\r\na grand addition to my lily acquaintances,—a true mountaineer, reaching\r\nprime vigor and beauty at a height of seven thousand feet or\r\nthereabouts. It varies, I find, very much in size even in the same\r\nmeadow, not only with the soil, but with age. I saw a specimen that had\r\nonly one flower, and another within a stone’s throw had twenty-five. And\r\nto think that the sheep should be allowed in these lily meadows! after\r\nhow many centuries of Nature’s care planting and watering them, tucking\r\nthe bulbs in snugly below winter frost, shading the tender shoots with\r\nclouds drawn above them like curtains, pouring refreshing rain, making\r\nthem perfect in beauty, and keeping them safe by a thousand miracles;\r\nyet, strange to say, allowing the trampling of devastating sheep. One\r\nmight reasonably look for a wall of fire to fence such gardens. So\r\nextravagant is Nature with her choicest treasures, spending plant beauty\r\nas she spends sunshine, pouring it forth into land and sea, garden and\r\ndesert. And so the beauty of lilies falls on angels and men, bears and\r\nsquirrels, wolves and sheep, birds and bees, but as far as I have seen,\r\nman alone, and the animals he tames, destroy these gardens. Awkward,\r\nlumbering bears, the Don tells me, love to wallow in them in hot\r\nweather, and deer with their sharp feet cross them again and again,\r\nsauntering and feeding, yet never a lily have I seen spoiled by them.\r\nRather, like gardeners, they seem to cultivate them, pressing and\r\ndibbling as required. Anyhow not a leaf or petal seems misplaced.\r\n\r\nThe trees round about them seem as perfect in beauty and form as the\r\nlilies, their boughs whorled like lily leaves in exact order. This\r\nevening, as usual, the glow of our camp-fire is working enchantment on\r\neverything within reach of its rays. Lying beneath the firs, it is\r\nglorious to see them dipping their spires in the starry sky, the sky\r\nlike one vast lily meadow in bloom! How can I close my eyes on so\r\nprecious a night?\r\n\r\n_July 10._ A Douglas squirrel, peppery, pungent autocrat of the woods,\r\nis barking overhead this morning, and the small forest birds, so seldom\r\nseen when one travels noisily, are out on sunny branches along the edge\r\nof the meadow getting warm, taking a sun bath and dew bath—a fine\r\nsight. How charming the sprightly confident looks and ways of these\r\nlittle feathered people of the trees! They seem sure of dainty,\r\nwholesome breakfasts, and where are so many breakfasts to come from? How\r\nhelpless should we find ourselves should we try to set a table for them\r\nof such buds, seeds, insects, etc., as would keep them in the pure wild\r\nhealth they enjoy! Not a headache or any other ache amongst them, I\r\nguess. As for the irrepressible Douglas squirrels, one never thinks of\r\ntheir breakfasts or the possibility of hunger, sickness or death; rather\r\nthey seem like stars above chance or change, even though we may see them\r\nat times busy gathering burrs, working hard for a living.\r\n\r\nOn through the forest ever higher we go, a cloud of dust dimming the\r\nway, thousands of feet trampling leaves and flowers, but in this mighty\r\nwilderness they seem but a feeble band, and a thousand gardens will\r\nescape their blighting touch. They cannot hurt the trees, though some of\r\nthe seedlings suffer, and should the woolly locusts be greatly\r\nmultiplied, as on account of dollar value they are likely to be, then\r\nthe forests, too, may in time be destroyed. Only the sky will then be\r\nsafe, though hid from view by dust and smoke, incense of a bad\r\nsacrifice. Poor, helpless, hungry sheep, in great part misbegotten,\r\nwithout good right to be, semi-manufactured, made less by God than man,\r\nborn out of time and place, yet their voices are strangely human and\r\ncall out one’s pity.\r\n\r\nOur way is still along the Merced and Tuolumne divide, the streams on\r\nour right going to swell the songful Yosemite River, those on our left\r\nto the songful Tuolumne, slipping through sunny carex and lily meadows,\r\nand breaking into song down a thousand ravines almost as soon as they\r\nare born. A more tuneful set of streams surely nowhere exists, or more\r\nsparkling crystal pure, now gliding with tinkling whisper, now with\r\nmerry dimpling rush, in and out through sunshine and shade, shimmering\r\nin pools, uniting their currents, bouncing, dancing from form to form\r\nover cliffs and inclines, ever more beautiful the farther they go until\r\nthey pour into the main glacial rivers.\r\n\r\nAll day I have been gazing in growing admiration at the noble groups of\r\nthe magnificent silver fir which more and more is taking the ground to\r\nitself. The woods above Crane Flat still continue comparatively open,\r\nletting in the sunshine on the brown needle-strewn ground. Not only are\r\nthe individual trees admirable in symmetry and superb in foliage and\r\nport, but half a dozen or more often form temple groves in which the\r\ntrees are so nicely graded in size and position as to seem one. Here,\r\nindeed, is the tree-lover’s paradise. The dullest eye in the world must\r\nsurely be quickened by such trees as these.\r\n\r\nFortunately the sheep need little attention, as they are driven slowly\r\nand allowed to nip and nibble as they like. Since leaving Hazel Green we\r\nhave been following the Yosemite trail; visitors to the famous valley\r\ncoming by way of Coulterville and Chinese Camp pass this way—the two\r\ntrails uniting at Crane Flat—and enter the valley on the north side.\r\nAnother trail enters on the south side by way of Mariposa. The tourists\r\nwe saw were in parties of from three or four to fifteen or twenty,\r\nmounted on mules or small mustang ponies. A strange show they made,\r\nwinding single file through the solemn woods in gaudy attire, scaring\r\nthe wild creatures, and one might fancy that even the great pines would\r\nbe disturbed and groan aghast. But what may we say of ourselves and the\r\nflock?\r\n\r\nWe are now camped at Tamarack Flat, within four or five miles of the\r\nlower end of Yosemite. Here is another fine meadow embosomed in the\r\nwoods, with a deep, clear stream gliding through it, its banks rounded\r\nand beveled with a thatch of dipping sedges. The flat is named after the\r\ntwo-leaved pine (_Pinus contorta_, var. _Murrayana_), common here,\r\nespecially around the cool margin of the meadow. On rocky ground it is a\r\nrough, thickset tree, about forty to sixty feet high and one to three\r\nfeet in diameter, bark thin and gummy, branches rather naked, tassels,\r\nleaves, and cones small. But in damp, rich soil it grows close and\r\nslender, and reaches a height at times of nearly a hundred feet.\r\nSpecimens only six inches in diameter at the ground are often fifty or\r\nsixty feet in height, as slender and sharp in outline as arrows, like\r\nthe true tamarack (larch) of the Eastern States; hence the name, though\r\nit is a pine.\r\n\r\n_July 11._ The Don has gone ahead on one of the pack animals to spy out\r\nthe land to the north of Yosemite in search of the best point for a\r\ncentral camp. Much higher than this we cannot now go, for the upper\r\npastures, said to be better than any hereabouts, are still buried in\r\nheavy winter snow. Glad I am that camp is to be fixed in the Yosemite\r\nregion, for many a glorious ramble I’ll have along the top of the walls,\r\nand then what landscapes I shall find with their new mountains and\r\ncañons, forests and gardens, lakes and streams and falls.\r\n\r\nWe are now about seven thousand feet above the sea, and the nights are\r\nso cool we have to pile coats and extra clothing on top of our blankets.\r\nTamarack Creek is icy cold, delicious, exhilarating champagne water. It\r\nis flowing bank-full in the meadow with silent speed, but only a few\r\nhundred yards below our camp the ground is bare gray granite strewn with\r\nboulders, large spaces being without a single tree or only a small one\r\nhere and there anchored in narrow seams and cracks. The boulders, many\r\nof them very large, are not in piles or scattered like rubbish among\r\nloose crumbling dÈbris as if weathered out of the solid as boulders of\r\ndisintegration; they mostly occur singly, and are lying on a clean\r\npavement on which the sunshine falls in a glare that contrasts with the\r\nshimmer of light and shade we have been accustomed to in the leafy\r\nwoods. And, strange to say, these boulders lying so still and deserted,\r\nwith no moving force near them, no boulder carrier anywhere in sight,\r\nwere nevertheless brought from a distance, as difference in color and\r\ncomposition shows, quarried and carried and laid down here each in its\r\nplace; nor have they stirred, most of them, through calm and storm since\r\nfirst they arrived. They look lonely here, strangers in a strange\r\nland,—huge blocks, angular mountain chips, the largest twenty or thirty\r\nfeet in diameter, the chips that Nature has made in modeling her\r\nlandscapes, fashioning the forms of her mountains and valleys. And with\r\nwhat tool were they quarried and carried? On the pavement we find its\r\nmarks. The most resisting unweathered portion of the surface is scored\r\nand striated in a rigidly parallel way, indicating that the region has\r\nbeen overswept by a glacier from the northeastward, grinding down the\r\ngeneral mass of the mountains, scoring and polishing, producing a\r\nstrange, raw, wiped appearance, and dropping whatever boulders it\r\nchanced to be carrying at the time it was melted at the close of the\r\nGlacial Period. A fine discovery this. As for the forests we have been\r\npassing through, they are probably growing on deposits of soil most of\r\nwhich has been laid down by this same ice agent in the form of moraines\r\nof different sorts, now in great part disintegrated and outspread by\r\npost-glacial weathering.\r\n\r\nOut of the grassy meadow and down over this ice-planed granite runs the\r\nglad young Tamarack Creek, rejoicing, exulting, chanting, dancing in\r\nwhite, glowing, irised falls and cascades on its way to the Merced\r\nCañon, a few miles below Yosemite, falling more than three thousand feet\r\nin a distance of about two miles.\r\n\r\nAll the Merced streams are wonderful singers, and Yosemite is the centre\r\nwhere the main tributaries meet. From a point about half a mile from our\r\ncamp we can see into the lower end of the famous valley, with its\r\nwonderful cliffs and groves, a grand page of mountain manuscript that I\r\nwould gladly give my life to be able to read. How vast it seems, how\r\nshort human life when we happen to think of it, and how little we may\r\nlearn, however hard we try! Yet why bewail our poor inevitable\r\nignorance? Some of the external beauty is always in sight, enough to\r\nkeep every fibre of us tingling, and this we are able to gloriously\r\nenjoy though the methods of its creation may lie beyond our ken. Sing\r\non, brave Tamarack Creek, fresh from your snowy fountains, plash and\r\nswirl and dance to your fate in the sea; bathing, cheering every living\r\nthing along your way.\r\n\r\nHave greatly enjoyed all this huge day, sauntering and seeing, steeping\r\nin the mountain influences, sketching, noting, pressing flowers,\r\ndrinking ozone and Tamarack water. Found the white fragrant Washington\r\nlily, the finest of all the Sierra lilies. Its bulbs are buried in\r\nshaggy chaparral tangles, I suppose for safety from pawing bears; and\r\nits magnificent panicles sway and rock over the top of the rough\r\nsnow-pressed bushes, while big, bold, blunt-nosed bees drone and mumble\r\nin its polleny bells. A lovely flower, worth going hungry and footsore\r\nendless miles to see. The whole world seems richer now that I have found\r\nthis plant in so noble a landscape.\r\n\r\nA log house serves to mark a claim to the Tamarack meadow, which may\r\nbecome valuable as a station in case travel to Yosemite should greatly\r\nincrease. Belated parties occasionally stop here. A white man with an\r\nIndian woman is holding possession of the place.\r\n\r\nSauntered up the meadow about sundown, out of sight of camp and sheep\r\nand all human mark, into the deep peace of the solemn old woods,\r\neverything glowing with Heaven’s unquenchable enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n_July 12._ The Don has returned, and again we go on pilgrimage.\r\n“Looking over the Yosemite Creek country,” he said, “from the tops of\r\nthe hills you see nothing but rocks and patches of trees; but when you\r\ngo down into the rocky desert you find no end of small grassy banks and\r\nmeadows, and so the country is not half so lean as it looks. There we’ll\r\ngo and stay until the snow is melted from the upper country.”\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear that the high snow made a stay in the Yosemite region\r\nnecessary, for I am anxious to see as much of it as possible. What fine\r\ntimes I shall have sketching, studying plants and rocks, and scrambling\r\nabout the brink of the great valley alone, out of sight and sound of\r\ncamp!\r\n\r\nWe saw another party of Yosemite tourists to-day. Somehow most of these\r\ntravelers seem to care but little for the glorious objects about them,\r\nthough enough to spend time and money and endure long rides to see the\r\nfamous valley. And when they are fairly within the mighty walls of the\r\ntemple and hear the psalms of the falls, they will forget themselves and\r\nbecome devout. Blessed, indeed, should be every pilgrim in these holy\r\nmountains!\r\n\r\nWe moved slowly eastward along the Mono Trail, and early in the\r\nafternoon unpacked and camped on the bank of Cascade Creek. The Mono\r\nTrail crosses the range by the Bloody Cañon Pass to gold mines near the\r\nnorth end of Mono Lake. These mines were reported to be rich when first\r\ndiscovered, and a grand rush took place, making a trail necessary. A few\r\nsmall bridges were built over streams where fording was not practicable\r\non account of the softness of the bottom, sections of fallen trees cut\r\nout, and lanes made through thickets wide enough to allow the passage of\r\nbulky packs; but over the greater part of the way scarce a stone or\r\nshovelful of earth has been moved.\r\n\r\nThe woods we passed through are composed almost wholly of _Abies\r\nmagnifica_, the companion species, _concolor_, being mostly left behind\r\non account of altitude, while the increasing elevation seems grateful to\r\nthe charming _magnifica_. No words can do anything like justice to this\r\nnoble tree. At one place many had fallen during some heavy wind-storm,\r\nowing to the loose sandy character of the soil, which offered no secure\r\nanchorage. The soil is mostly decomposed and disintegrated moraine\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe sheep are lying down on a bare rocky spot such as they like, chewing\r\nthe cud in grassy peace. Cooking is going on, appetites growing keener\r\nevery day. No lowlander can appreciate the mountain appetite, and the\r\nfacility with which heavy food called “grub” is disposed of. Eating,\r\nwalking, resting, seem alike delightful, and one feels inclined to shout\r\nlustily on rising in the morning like a crowing cock. Sleep and\r\ndigestion as clear as the air. Fine spicy plush boughs for bedding we\r\nshall have to-night, and a glorious lullaby from this cascading creek.\r\nNever was stream more fittingly named, for as far as I have traced it\r\nabove and below our camp it is one continuous bouncing, dancing, white\r\nbloom of cascades. And at the very last unwearied it finishes its wild\r\ncourse in a grand leap of three hundred feet or more to the bottom of\r\nthe main Yosemite cañon near the fall of Tamarack Creek, a few miles\r\nbelow the foot of the valley. These falls almost rival some of the\r\nfar-famed Yosemite falls. Never shall I forget these glad cascade songs,\r\nthe low booming, the roaring, the keen, silvery clashing of the cool\r\nwater rushing exulting from form to form beneath irised spray; or in the\r\ndeep still night seen white in the darkness, and its multitude of voices\r\nsounding still more impressively sublime. Here I find the little water\r\nouzel as much at home as any linnet in a leafy grove, seeming to take\r\nthe greater delight the more boisterous the stream. The dizzy\r\nprecipices, the swift dashing energy displayed, and the thunder tones of\r\nthe sheer falls are awe inspiring, but there is nothing awful about\r\nthis little bird. Its song is sweet and low, and all its gestures, as it\r\nflits about amid the loud uproar, bespeak strength and peace and joy.\r\nContemplating these darlings of Nature coming forth from spray-sprinkled\r\nnests on the brink of savage streams, Samson’s riddle comes to mind,\r\n“Out of the strong cometh forth sweetness.” A yet finer bloom is this\r\nlittle bird than the foam-bells in eddying pools. Gentle bird, a\r\nprecious message you bring me. We may miss the meaning of the torrent,\r\nbut thy sweet voice, only love is in it.\r\n\r\n_July 13._ Our course all day has been eastward over the rim of Yosemite\r\nCreek basin and down about halfway to the bottom, where we have encamped\r\non a sheet of glacier-polished granite, a firm foundation for beds. Saw\r\nthe tracks of a very large bear on the trail, and the Don talked of\r\nbears in general. I said I should like to see the maker of these immense\r\ntracks as he marched along, and follow him for days, without disturbing\r\nhim, to learn something of the life of this master beast of the\r\nwilderness. Lambs, the Don told me, born in the lowland, that never saw\r\nor heard a bear, snort and run in terror when they catch the scent,\r\nshowing how fully they have inherited a knowledge of their enemy. Hogs,\r\nmules, horses, and cattle are afraid of bears, and are seized with\r\nungovernable terror when they approach, particularly hogs and mules.\r\nHogs are frequently driven to pastures in the foothills of the Coast\r\nRange and Sierra where acorns are abundant, and are herded in droves of\r\nhundreds like sheep. When a bear comes to the range they promptly leave\r\nit, emigrating in a body, usually in the night time, the keepers being\r\npowerless to prevent; they thus show more sense than sheep, that simply\r\nscatter in the rocks and brush and await their fate. Mules flee like the\r\nwind with or without riders when they see a bear, and, if picketed,\r\nsometimes break their necks in trying to break their ropes, though I\r\nhave not heard of bears killing mules or horses. Of hogs they are said\r\nto be particularly fond, bolting small ones, bones and all, without\r\nchoice of parts. In particular, Mr. Delaney assured me that all kinds of\r\nbears in the Sierra are very shy, and that hunters found far greater\r\ndifficulty in getting within gunshot of them than of deer or indeed any\r\nother animal in the Sierra, and if I was anxious to see much of them I\r\nshould have to wait and watch with endless Indian patience and pay no\r\nattention to anything else.\r\n\r\nNight is coming on, the gray rock waves are growing dim in the twilight.\r\nHow raw and young this region appears! Had the ice sheet that swept\r\nover it vanished but yesterday, its traces on the more resisting\r\nportions about our camp could hardly be more distinct than they now are.\r\nThe horses and sheep and all of us, indeed, slipped on the smoothest\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n_July 14._ How deathlike is sleep in this mountain air, and quick the\r\nawakening into newness of life! A calm dawn, yellow and purple, then\r\nfloods of sun-gold, making every thing tingle and glow.\r\n\r\nIn an hour or two we came to Yosemite Creek, the stream that makes the\r\ngreatest of all the Yosemite falls. It is about forty feet wide at the\r\nMono Trail crossing, and now about four feet in average depth, flowing\r\nabout three miles an hour. The distance to the verge of the Yosemite\r\nwall, where it makes its tremendous plunge, is only about two miles from\r\nhere. Calm, beautiful, and nearly silent, it glides with stately\r\ngestures, a dense growth of the slender two-leaved pine along its banks,\r\nand a fringe of willow, purple spirea, sedges, daisies, lilies, and\r\ncolumbines. Some of the sedges and willow boughs dip into the current,\r\nand just outside of the close ranks of trees there is a sunny flat of\r\nwashed gravelly sand which seems to have been deposited by some ancient\r\nflood. It is covered with millions of erethrea, eriogonum, and\r\noxytheca, with more flowers than leaves, forming an even growth,\r\nslightly dimpled and ruffled here and there by rosettes of _Spraguea\r\numbellata_. Back of this flowery strip there is a wavy upsloping plain\r\nof solid granite, so smoothly ice-polished in many places that it\r\nglistens in the sun like glass. In shallow hollows there are patches of\r\ntrees, mostly the rough form of the two-leaved pine, rather scrawny\r\nlooking where there is little or no soil. Also a few junipers\r\n(_Juniperus occidentalis_), short and stout, with bright\r\ncinnamon-colored bark and gray foliage, standing alone mostly, on the\r\nsun-beaten pavement, safe from fire, clinging by slight joints,—a\r\nsturdy storm-enduring mountaineer of a tree, living on sunshine and\r\nsnow, maintaining tough health on this diet for perhaps more than a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nUp towards the head of the basin I see groups of domes rising above the\r\nwavelike ridges, and some picturesque castellated masses, and dark\r\nstrips and patches of silver fir, indicating deposits of fertile soil.\r\nWould that I could command the time to study them! What rich excursions\r\none could make in this well-defined basin! Its glacial inscriptions and\r\nsculptures, how marvelous they seem, how noble the studies they offer! I\r\ntremble with excitement in the dawn of these glorious mountain\r\nsublimities, but I can only gaze and wonder, and, like a child, gather\r\nhere and there a lily, half hoping I may be able to study and learn in\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\nThe drivers and dogs had a lively, laborious time getting the sheep\r\nacross the creek, the second large stream thus far that they have been\r\ncompelled to cross without a bridge; the first being the North Fork of\r\nthe Merced near Bower Cave. Men and dogs, shouting and barking, drove\r\nthe timid, water-fearing creatures in a close crowd against the bank,\r\nbut not one of the flock would launch away. While thus jammed, the Don\r\nand the shepherd rushed through the frightened crowd to stampede those\r\nin front, but this would only cause a break backward, and away they\r\nwould scamper through the stream-bank trees and scatter over the rocky\r\npavement. Then with the aid of the dogs the runaways would again be\r\ngathered and made to face the stream, and again the compacted mass would\r\nbreak away, amid wild shouting and barking that might well have\r\ndisturbed the stream itself and marred the music of its falls, to which\r\nvisitors no doubt from all quarters of the globe were listening. “Hold\r\nthem there! Now hold them there!” shouted the Don; “the front ranks will\r\nsoon tire of the pressure, and be glad to take to the water, then all\r\nwill jump in and cross in a hurry.” But they did nothing of the kind;\r\nthey only avoided the pressure by breaking back in scores and hundreds,\r\nleaving the beauty of the banks sadly trampled.\r\n\r\nIf only one could be got to cross over, all would make haste to follow;\r\nbut that one could not be found. A lamb was caught, carried across, and\r\ntied to a bush on the opposite bank, where it cried piteously for its\r\nmother. But though greatly concerned, the mother only called it back.\r\nThat play on maternal affection failed, and we began to fear that we\r\nshould be forced to make a long roundabout drive and cross the\r\nwide-spread tributaries of the creek in succession. This would require\r\nseveral days, but it had its advantages, for I was eager to see the\r\nsources of so famous a stream. Don Quixote, however, determined that\r\nthey must ford just here, and immediately began a sort of siege by\r\ncutting down slender pines on the bank and building a corral barely\r\nlarge enough to hold the flock when well pressed together. And as the\r\nstream would form one side of the corral he believed that they could\r\neasily be forced into the water.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours the inclosure was completed, and the silly animals were\r\ndriven in and rammed hard against the brink of the ford. Then the Don,\r\nforcing a way through the compacted mass, pitched a few of the terrified\r\nunfortunates into the stream by main strength; but instead of crossing\r\nover, they swam about close to the bank, making desperate attempts to\r\nget back into the flock. Then a dozen or more were shoved off, and the\r\nDon, tall like a crane and a good natural wader, jumped in after them,\r\nseized a struggling wether, and dragged it to the opposite shore. But no\r\nsooner did he let it go than it jumped into the stream and swam back to\r\nits frightened companions in the corral, thus manifesting sheep-nature\r\nas unchangeable as gravitation. Pan with his pipes would have had no\r\nbetter luck, I fear. We were now pretty well baffled. The silly\r\ncreatures would suffer any sort of death rather than cross that stream.\r\nCalling a council, the dripping Don declared that starvation was now the\r\nonly likely scheme to try, and that we might as well camp here in\r\ncomfort and let the besieged flock grow hungry and cool, and come to\r\ntheir senses, if they had any. In a few minutes after being thus let\r\nalone, an adventurer in the foremost rank plunged in and swam bravely to\r\nthe farther shore. Then suddenly all rushed in pell-mell together,\r\ntrampling one another under water, while we vainly tried to hold them\r\nback. The Don jumped into the thickest of the gasping, gurgling,\r\ndrowning mass, and shoved them right and left as if each sheep was a\r\npiece of floating timber. The current also served to drift them apart; a\r\nlong bent column was soon formed, and in a few minutes all were over and\r\nbegan baaing and feeding as if nothing out of the common had happened.\r\nThat none were drowned seems wonderful. I fully expected that hundreds\r\nwould gain the romantic fate of being swept into Yosemite over the\r\nhighest waterfall in the world.\r\n\r\nAs the day was far spent, we camped a little way back from the ford, and\r\nlet the dripping flock scatter and feed until sundown. The wool is dry\r\nnow, and calm, cud-chewing peace has fallen on all the comfortable band,\r\nleaving no trace of the watery battle. I have seen fish driven out of\r\nthe water with less ado than was made in driving these animals into it.\r\nSheep brain must surely be poor stuff. Compare today’s exhibition with\r\nthe performances of deer swimming quietly across broad and rapid rivers,\r\nand from island to island in seas and lakes; or with dogs, or even with\r\nthe squirrels that, as the story goes, cross the Mississippi River on\r\nselected chips, with tails for sails comfortably trimmed to the breeze.\r\nA sheep can hardly be called an animal; an entire flock is required to\r\nmake one foolish individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE YOSEMITE\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 15._ Followed the Mono Trail up the eastern rim of the basin\r\nnearly to its summit, then turned off southward to a small shallow\r\nvalley that extends to the edge of the Yosemite, which we reached about\r\nnoon, and encamped. After luncheon I made haste to high ground, and from\r\nthe top of the ridge on the west side of Indian Cañon gained the noblest\r\nview of the summit peaks I have ever yet enjoyed. Nearly all the upper\r\nbasin of the Merced was displayed, with its sublime domes and cañons,\r\ndark upsweeping forests, and glorious array of white peaks deep in the\r\nsky, every feature glowing, radiating beauty that pours into our flesh\r\nand bones like heat rays from fire. Sunshine over all; no breath of wind\r\nto stir the brooding calm. Never before had I seen so glorious a\r\nlandscape, so boundless an affluence of sublime mountain beauty. The\r\nmost extravagant description I might give of this view to any one who\r\nhas not seen similar landscapes with his own eyes would not so much as\r\nhint its grandeur and the spiritual glow that covered it. I shouted and\r\ngesticulated in a wild burst of ecstasy, much to the astonishment of\r\nSt. Bernard Carlo, who came running up to me, manifesting in his\r\nintelligent eyes a puzzled concern that was very ludicrous, which had\r\nthe effect of bringing me to my senses. A brown bear, too, it would\r\nseem, had been a spectator of the show I had made of myself, for I had\r\ngone but a few yards when I started one from a thicket of brush. He\r\nevidently considered me dangerous, for he ran away very fast, tumbling\r\nover the tops of the tangled manzanita bushes in his haste. Carlo drew\r\nback, with his ears depressed as if afraid, and kept looking me in the\r\nface, as if expecting me to pursue and shoot, for he had seen many a\r\nbear battle in his day.\r\n\r\nFollowing the ridge, which made a gradual descent to the south, I came\r\nat length to the brow of that massive cliff that stands between Indian\r\nCañon and Yosemite Falls, and here the far-famed valley came suddenly\r\ninto view throughout almost its whole extent. The noble walls—sculptured\r\ninto endless variety of domes and gables, spires and battlements and\r\nplain mural precipices—all a-tremble with the thunder tones of the\r\nfalling water. The level bottom seemed to be dressed like a garden—sunny\r\nmeadows here and there, and groves of pine and oak; the river of Mercy\r\nsweeping in majesty through the midst of them and flashing back the\r\nsunbeams. The great Tissiack, or Half-Dome, rising at the upper end of\r\nthe valley to a height of nearly a mile, is nobly proportioned and\r\nlife-like, the most impressive of all the rocks, holding the eye in\r\ndevout admiration, calling it back again and again from falls or meadows,\r\nor even the mountains beyond,—marvelous cliffs, marvelous in sheer dizzy\r\ndepth and sculpture, types of endurance. Thousands of years have they\r\nstood in the sky exposed to rain, snow, frost, earthquake and avalanche,\r\nyet they still wear the bloom of youth.\r\n\r\nI rambled along the valley rim to the westward; most of it is rounded\r\noff on the very brink, so that it is not easy to find places where one\r\nmay look clear down the face of the wall to the bottom. When such places\r\nwere found, and I had cautiously set my feet and drawn my body erect, I\r\ncould not help fearing a little that the rock might split off and let me\r\ndown, and what a down!—more than three thousand feet. Still my limbs\r\ndid not tremble, nor did I feel the least uncertainty as to the reliance\r\nto be placed on them. My only fear was that a flake of the granite,\r\nwhich in some places showed joints more or less open and running\r\nparallel with the face of the cliff, might give way. After withdrawing\r\nfrom such places, excited with the view I had got, I would say to\r\nmyself, “Now don’t go out on the verge again.” But in the face of\r\nYosemite scenery cautious remonstrance is vain; under its spell one’s\r\nbody seems to go where it likes with a will over which we seem to have\r\nscarce any control.\r\n\r\nAfter a mile or so of this memorable cliff work I approached Yosemite\r\nCreek, admiring its easy, graceful, confident gestures as it comes\r\nbravely forward in its narrow channel, singing the last of its mountain\r\nsongs on its way to its fate—a few rods more over the shining granite,\r\nthen down half a mile in showy foam to another world, to be lost in the\r\nMerced, where climate, vegetation, inhabitants, all are different.\r\nEmerging from its last gorge, it glides in wide lace-like rapids down a\r\nsmooth incline into a pool where it seems to rest and compose its gray,\r\nagitated waters before taking the grand plunge, then slowly slipping\r\nover the lip of the pool basin, it descends another glossy slope with\r\nrapidly accelerated speed to the brink of the tremendous cliff, and with\r\nsublime, fateful confidence springs out free in the air.\r\n\r\nI took off my shoes and stockings and worked my way cautiously down\r\nalongside the rushing flood, keeping my feet and hands pressed firmly on\r\nthe polished rock. The booming, roaring water, rushing past close to my\r\nhead, was very exciting. I had expected that the sloping apron would\r\nterminate with the perpendicular wall of the valley, and that from the\r\nfoot of it, where it is less steeply inclined, I should be able to lean\r\nfar enough out to see the forms and behavior of the fall all the way\r\ndown to the bottom. But I found that there was yet another small brow\r\nover which I could not see, and which appeared to be too steep for\r\nmortal feet. Scanning it keenly, I discovered a narrow shelf about three\r\ninches wide on the very brink, just wide enough for a rest for one’s\r\nheels. But there seemed to be no way of reaching it over so steep a\r\nbrow. At length, after careful scrutiny of the surface, I found an\r\nirregular edge of a flake of the rock some distance back from the margin\r\nof the torrent. If I was to get down to the brink at all that rough\r\nedge, which might offer slight finger-holds, was the only way. But the\r\nslope beside it looked dangerously smooth and steep, and the swift\r\nroaring flood beneath, overhead, and beside me was very nerve-trying. I\r\ntherefore concluded not to venture farther, but did nevertheless. Tufts\r\nof artemisia were growing in clefts of the rock near by, and I filled my\r\nmouth with the bitter leaves, hoping they might help to prevent\r\ngiddiness. Then, with a caution not known in ordinary circumstances, I\r\ncrept down safely to the little ledge, got my heels well planted on it,\r\nthen shuffled in a horizontal direction twenty or thirty feet until\r\nclose to the outplunging current, which, by the time it had descended\r\nthus far, was already white. Here I obtained a perfectly free view down\r\ninto the heart of the snowy, chanting throng of comet-like streamers,\r\ninto which the body of the fall soon separates.\r\n\r\nWhile perched on that narrow niche I was not distinctly conscious of\r\ndanger. The tremendous grandeur of the fall in form and sound and\r\nmotion, acting at close range, smothered the sense of fear, and in such\r\nplaces one’s body takes keen care for safety on its own account. How\r\nlong I remained down there, or how I returned, I can hardly tell. Anyhow\r\nI had a glorious time, and got back to camp about dark, enjoying\r\ntriumphant exhilaration soon followed by dull weariness. Hereafter I’ll\r\ntry to keep from such extravagant, nerve-straining places. Yet such a\r\nday is well worth venturing for. My first view of the High Sierra, first\r\nview looking down into Yosemite, the death song of Yosemite Creek, and\r\nits flight over the vast cliff, each one of these is of itself enough\r\nfor a great life-long landscape fortune—a most memorable day of\r\ndays—enjoyment enough to kill if that were possible.\r\n\r\n_July 16._ My enjoyments yesterday afternoon, especially at the head of\r\nthe fall, were too great for good sleep. Kept starting up last night in\r\na nervous tremor, half awake, fancying that the foundation of the\r\nmountain we were camped on had given way and was falling into Yosemite\r\nValley. In vain I roused myself to make a new beginning for sound sleep.\r\nThe nerve strain had been too great, and again and again I dreamed I was\r\nrushing through the air above a glorious avalanche of water and rocks.\r\nOne time, springing to my feet, I said, “This time it is real—all must\r\ndie, and where could mountaineer find a more glorious death!”\r\n\r\nLeft camp soon after sunrise for an all-day ramble eastward. Crossed the\r\nhead of Indian Basin, forested with _Abies magnifica_, underbrush mostly\r\n_Ceanothus cordulatus_ and manzanita, a mixture not easily trampled over\r\nor penetrated, for the ceanothus is thorny and grows in dense\r\nsnow-pressed masses, and the manzanita has exceedingly crooked, stubborn\r\nbranches. From the head of the cañon continued on past North Dome into\r\nthe basin of Dome or Porcupine Creek. Here are many fine meadows\r\nimbedded in the woods, gay with _Lilium parvum_ and its companions; the\r\nelevation, about eight thousand feet, seems to be best suited for\r\nit—saw specimens that were a foot or two higher than my head. Had more\r\nmagnificent views of the upper mountains, and of the great South Dome,\r\nsaid to be the grandest rock in the world. Well it may be, since it is\r\nof such noble dimensions and sculpture. A wonderfully impressive\r\nmonument, its lines exquisite in fineness, and though sublime in size,\r\nis finished like the finest work of art, and seems to be alive.\r\n\r\n_July 17._ A new camp was made to-day in a magnificent silver fir grove\r\nat the head of a small stream that flows into Yosemite by way of Indian\r\nCañon. Here we intend to stay several weeks,—a fine location from which\r\nto make excursions about the great valley and its fountains. Glorious\r\ndays I’ll have sketching, pressing plants, studying the wonderful\r\ntopography and the wild animals, our happy fellow mortals and neighbors.\r\nBut the vast mountains in the distance, shall I ever know them, shall I\r\nbe allowed to enter into their midst and dwell with them?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The North and South Domes_]\r\n\r\nWe were pelted about noon by a short, heavy rainstorm, sublime thunder\r\nreverberating among the mountains and cañons,—some strokes near,\r\ncrashing, ringing in the tense crisp air with startling keenness, while\r\nthe distant peaks loomed gloriously through the cloud fringes and sheets\r\nof rain. Now the storm is past, and the fresh washed air is full of\r\nthe essences of the flower gardens and groves. Winter storms in Yosemite\r\nmust be glorious. May I see them!\r\n\r\nHave got my bed made in our new camp,—plushy, sumptuous, and\r\ndeliciously fragrant, most of it _magnifica_ fir plumes, of course, with\r\na variety of sweet flowers in the pillow. Hope to sleep to-night without\r\ntottering nerve-dreams. Watched a deer eating ceanothus leaves and\r\ntwigs.\r\n\r\n_July 18._ Slept pretty well; the valley walls did not seem to fall,\r\nthough I still fancied myself at the brink, alongside the white,\r\nplunging flood, especially when half asleep. Strange the danger of that\r\nadventure should be more troublesome now that I am in the bosom of the\r\npeaceful woods, a mile or more from the fall, than it was while I was on\r\nthe brink of it.\r\n\r\nBears seem to be common here, judging by their tracks. About noon we had\r\nanother rainstorm with keen startling thunder, the metallic, ringing,\r\nclashing, clanging notes gradually fading into low bass rolling and\r\nmuttering in the distance. For a few minutes the rain came in a grand\r\ntorrent like a waterfall, then hail; some of the hailstones an inch in\r\ndiameter, hard, icy, and irregular in form, like those oftentimes seen\r\nin Wisconsin. Carlo watched them with intelligent astonishment as they\r\ncame pelting and thrashing through the quivering branches of the trees.\r\nThe cloud scenery sublime. Afternoon calm, sunful, and clear, with\r\ndelicious freshness and fragrance from the firs and flowers and steaming\r\nground.\r\n\r\n_July 19._ Watching the daybreak and sunrise. The pale rose and purple\r\nsky changing softly to daffodil yellow and white, sunbeams pouring\r\nthrough the passes between the peaks and over the Yosemite domes, making\r\ntheir edges burn; the silver firs in the middle ground catching the glow\r\non their spiry tops, and our camp grove fills and thrills with the\r\nglorious light. Everything awakening alert and joyful; the birds begin\r\nto stir and innumerable insect people. Deer quietly withdraw into leafy\r\nhiding-places in the chaparral; the dew vanishes, flowers spread their\r\npetals, every pulse beats high, every life cell rejoices, the very rocks\r\nseem to thrill with life. The whole landscape glows like a human face in\r\na glory of enthusiasm, and the blue sky, pale around the horizon, bends\r\npeacefully down over all like one vast flower.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, as usual, big bossy cumuli began to grow above the forest,\r\nand the rainstorm pouring from them is the most imposing I have yet\r\nseen. The silvery zigzag lightning lances are longer than usual, and\r\nthe thunder gloriously impressive, keen, crashing, intensely\r\nconcentrated, speaking with such tremendous energy it would seem that an\r\nentire mountain is being shattered at every stroke, but probably only a\r\nfew trees are being shattered, many of which I have seen on my walks\r\nhereabouts strewing the ground. At last the clear ringing strokes are\r\nsucceeded by deep low tones that grow gradually fainter as they roll\r\nafar into the recesses of the echoing mountains, where they seem to be\r\nwelcomed home. Then another and another peal, or rather crashing,\r\nsplintering stroke, follows in quick succession, perchance splitting\r\nsome giant pine or fir from top to bottom into long rails and slivers,\r\nand scattering them to all points of the compass. Now comes the rain,\r\nwith corresponding extravagant grandeur, covering the ground high and\r\nlow with a sheet of flowing water, a transparent film fitted like a skin\r\nupon the rugged anatomy of the landscape, making the rocks glitter and\r\nglow, gathering in the ravines, flooding the streams, and making them\r\nshout and boom in reply to the thunder.\r\n\r\nHow interesting to trace the history of a single raindrop! It is not\r\nlong, geologically speaking, as we have seen, since the first raindrops\r\nfell on the newborn leafless Sierra landscapes. How different the lot\r\nof these falling now! Happy the showers that fall on so fair a\r\nwilderness,—scarce a single drop can fail to find a beautiful spot,—on\r\nthe tops of the peaks, on the shining glacier pavements, on the great\r\nsmooth domes, on forests and gardens and brushy moraines, plashing,\r\nglinting, pattering, laving. Some go to the high snowy fountains to\r\nswell their well-saved stores; some into the lakes, washing the mountain\r\nwindows, patting their smooth glassy levels, making dimples and bubbles\r\nand spray; some into the waterfalls and cascades, as if eager to join in\r\ntheir dance and song and beat their foam yet finer; good luck and good\r\nwork for the happy mountain raindrops, each one of them a high waterfall\r\nin itself, descending from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds to the\r\ncliffs and hollows of the rocks, out of the sky-thunder into the thunder\r\nof the falling rivers. Some, falling on meadows and bogs, creep silently\r\nout of sight to the grass roots, hiding softly as in a nest, slipping,\r\noozing hither, thither, seeking and finding their appointed work. Some,\r\ndescending through the spires of the woods, sift spray through the\r\nshining needles, whispering peace and good cheer to each one of them.\r\nSome drops with happy aim glint on the sides of crystals,—quartz,\r\nhornblende, garnet, zircon, tourmaline, feldspar,—patter on grains of\r\ngold and heavy way-worn nuggets; some, with blunt plap-plap and low bass\r\ndrumming, fall on the broad leaves of veratrum, saxifrage, cypripedium.\r\nSome happy drops fall straight into the cups of flowers, kissing the\r\nlips of lilies. How far they have to go, how many cups to fill, great\r\nand small, cells too small to be seen, cups holding half a drop as well\r\nas lake basins between the hills, each replenished with equal care,\r\nevery drop in all the blessed throng a silvery newborn star with lake\r\nand river, garden and grove, valley and mountain, all that the landscape\r\nholds reflected in its crystal depths, God’s messenger, angel of love\r\nsent on its way with majesty and pomp and display of power that make\r\nman’s greatest shows ridiculous.\r\n\r\nNow the storm is over, the sky is clear, the last rolling thunder-wave\r\nis spent on the peaks, and where are the raindrops now—what has become\r\nof all the shining throng? In winged vapor rising some are already\r\nhastening back to the sky, some have gone into the plants, creeping\r\nthrough invisible doors into the round rooms of cells, some are locked\r\nin crystals of ice, some in rock crystals, some in porous moraines to\r\nkeep their small springs flowing, some have gone journeying on in the\r\nrivers to join the larger raindrop of the ocean. From form to form,\r\nbeauty to beauty, ever changing, never resting, all are speeding on with\r\nlove’s enthusiasm, singing with the stars the eternal song of creation.\r\n\r\n_July 20._ Fine calm morning; air tense and clear; not the slightest\r\nbreeze astir; everything shining, the rocks with wet crystals, the\r\nplants with dew, each receiving its portion of irised dewdrops and\r\nsunshine like living creatures getting their breakfast, their dew manna\r\ncoming down from the starry sky like swarms of smaller stars. How\r\nwondrous fine are the particles in showers of dew, thousands required\r\nfor a single drop, growing in the dark as silently as the grass! What\r\npains are taken to keep this wilderness in health,—showers of snow,\r\nshowers of rain, showers of dew, floods of light, floods of invisible\r\nvapor, clouds, winds, all sorts of weather, interaction of plant on\r\nplant, animal on animal, etc., beyond thought! How fine Nature’s\r\nmethods! How deeply with beauty is beauty overlaid! the ground covered\r\nwith crystals, the crystals with mosses and lichens and low-spreading\r\ngrasses and flowers, these with larger plants leaf over leaf with\r\never-changing color and form, the broad palms of the firs outspread over\r\nthese, the azure dome over all like a bell-flower, and star above star.\r\n\r\nYonder stands the South Dome, its crown high above our camp, though its\r\nbase is four thousand feet below us; a most noble rock, it seems full of\r\nthought, clothed with living light, no sense of dead stone about it, all\r\nspiritualized, neither heavy looking nor light, steadfast in serene\r\nstrength like a god.\r\n\r\nOur shepherd is a queer character and hard to place in this wilderness.\r\nHis bed is a hollow made in red dry-rot punky dust beside a log which\r\nforms a portion of the south wall of the corral. Here he lies with his\r\nwonderful everlasting clothing on, wrapped in a red blanket, breathing\r\nnot only the dust of the decayed wood but also that of the corral, as if\r\ndetermined to take ammoniacal snuff all night after chewing tobacco all\r\nday. Following the sheep he carries a heavy six-shooter swung from his\r\nbelt on one side and his luncheon on the other. The ancient cloth in\r\nwhich the meat, fresh from the frying-pan, is tied serves as a filter\r\nthrough which the clear fat and gravy juices drip down on his right hip\r\nand leg in clustering stalactites. This oleaginous formation is soon\r\nbroken up, however, and diffused and rubbed evenly into his scanty\r\napparel, by sitting down, rolling over, crossing his legs while resting\r\non logs, etc., making shirt and trousers water-tight and shiny. His\r\ntrousers, in particular, have become so adhesive with the mixed fat and\r\nresin that pine needles, thin flakes and fibres of bark, hair, mica\r\nscales and minute grains of quartz, hornblende, etc., feathers, seed\r\nwings, moth and butterfly wings, legs and antennæ of innumerable\r\ninsects, or even whole insects such as the small beetles, moths and\r\nmosquitoes, with flower petals, pollen dust and indeed bits of all\r\nplants, animals, and minerals of the region adhere to them and are\r\nsafely imbedded, so that though far from being a naturalist he collects\r\nfragmentary specimens of everything and becomes richer than he knows.\r\nHis specimens are kept passably fresh, too, by the purity of the air and\r\nthe resiny bituminous beds into which they are pressed. Man is a\r\nmicrocosm, at least our shepherd is, or rather his trousers. These\r\nprecious overalls are never taken off, and nobody knows how old they\r\nare, though one may guess by their thickness and concentric structure.\r\nInstead of wearing thin they wear thick, and in their stratification\r\nhave no small geological significance.\r\n\r\nBesides herding the sheep, Billy is the butcher, while I have agreed to\r\nwash the few iron and tin utensils and make the bread. Then, these small\r\nduties done, by the time the sun is fairly above the mountain-tops I am\r\nbeyond the flock, free to rove and revel in the wilderness all the big\r\nimmortal days.\r\n\r\nSketching on the North Dome. It commands views of nearly all the valley\r\nbesides a few of the high mountains. I would fain draw everything in\r\nsight—rock, tree, and leaf. But little can I do beyond mere\r\noutlines,—marks with meanings like words, readable only to myself,—yet\r\nI sharpen my pencils and work on as if others might possibly be\r\nbenefited. Whether these picture-sheets are to vanish like fallen leaves\r\nor go to friends like letters, matters not much; for little can they\r\ntell to those who have not themselves seen similar wildness, and like a\r\nlanguage have learned it. No pain here, no dull empty hours, no fear of\r\nthe past, no fear of the future. These blessed mountains are so\r\ncompactly filled with God’s beauty, no petty personal hope or experience\r\nhas room to be. Drinking this champagne water is pure pleasure, so is\r\nbreathing the living air, and every movement of limbs is pleasure, while\r\nthe whole body seems to feel beauty when exposed to it as it feels the\r\ncamp-fire or sunshine, entering not by the eyes alone, but equally\r\nthrough all one’s flesh like radiant heat, making a passionate ecstatic\r\npleasure-glow not explainable. One’s body then seems homogeneous\r\nthroughout, sound as a crystal. Perched like a fly on this Yosemite\r\ndome, I gaze and sketch and bask, oftentimes settling down into dumb\r\nadmiration without definite hope of ever learning much, yet with the\r\nlonging, unresting effort that lies at the door of hope, humbly\r\nprostrate before the vast display of God’s power, and eager to offer\r\nself-denial and renunciation with eternal toil to learn any lesson in\r\nthe divine manuscript.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to feel than to realize, or in any way explain, Yosemite\r\ngrandeur. The magnitudes of the rocks and trees and streams are so\r\ndelicately harmonized they are mostly hidden. Sheer precipices three\r\nthousand feet high are fringed with tall trees growing close like grass\r\non the brow of a lowland hill, and extending along the feet of these\r\nprecipices a ribbon of meadow a mile wide and seven or eight long, that\r\nseems like a strip a farmer might mow in less than a day. Waterfalls,\r\nfive hundred to one or two thousand feet high, are so subordinated to\r\nthe mighty cliffs over which they pour that they seem like wisps of\r\nsmoke, gentle as floating clouds, though their voices fill the valley\r\nand make the rocks tremble. The mountains, too, along the eastern sky,\r\nand the domes in front of them, and the succession of smooth rounded\r\nwaves between, swelling higher, higher, with dark woods in their\r\nhollows, serene in massive exuberant bulk and beauty, tend yet more to\r\nhide the grandeur of the Yosemite temple and make it appear as a subdued\r\nsubordinate feature of the vast harmonious landscape. Thus every attempt\r\nto appreciate any one feature is beaten down by the overwhelming\r\ninfluence of all the others. And, as if this were not enough, lo! in the\r\nsky arises another mountain range with topography as rugged and\r\nsubstantial-looking as the one beneath it—snowy peaks and domes and\r\nshadowy Yosemite valleys—another version of the snowy Sierra, a new\r\ncreation heralded by a thunder-storm. How fiercely, devoutly wild is\r\nNature in the midst of her beauty-loving tenderness!—painting lilies,\r\nwatering them, caressing them with gentle hand, going from flower to\r\nflower like a gardener while building rock mountains and cloud mountains\r\nfull of lightning and rain. Gladly we run for shelter beneath an\r\noverhanging cliff and examine the reassuring ferns and mosses, gentle\r\nlove tokens growing in cracks and chinks. Daisies, too, and ivesias,\r\nconfiding wild children of light, too small to fear. To these one’s\r\nheart goes home, and the voices of the storm become gentle. Now the sun\r\nbreaks forth and fragrant steam arises. The birds are out singing on the\r\nedges of the groves. The west is flaming in gold and purple, ready for\r\nthe ceremony of the sunset, and back I go to camp with my notes and\r\npictures, the best of them printed in my mind as dreams. A fruitful day,\r\nwithout measured beginning or ending. A terrestrial eternity. A gift of\r\ngood God.\r\n\r\nWrote to my mother and a few friends, mountain hints to each. They seem\r\nas near as if within voice-reach or touch. The deeper the solitude the\r\nless the sense of loneliness, and the nearer our friends. Now bread and\r\ntea, fir bed and good-night to Carlo, a look at the sky lilies, and\r\ndeath sleep until the dawn of another Sierra to-morrow.\r\n\r\n_July 21._ Sketching on the Dome—no rain; clouds at noon about quarter\r\nfilled the sky, casting shadows with fine effect on the white mountains\r\nat the heads of the streams, and a soothing cover over the gardens\r\nduring the warm hours.\r\n\r\nSaw a common house-fly and a grasshopper and a brown bear. The fly and\r\ngrasshopper paid me a merry visit on the top of the Dome, and I paid a\r\nvisit to the bear in the middle of a small garden meadow between the\r\nDome and the camp where he was standing alert among the flowers as if\r\nwilling to be seen to advantage. I had not gone more than half a mile\r\nfrom camp this morning, when Carlo, who was trotting on a few yards\r\nahead of me, came to a sudden, cautious standstill. Down went tail and\r\nears, and forward went his knowing nose, while he seemed to be saying,\r\n“Ha, what’s this? A bear, I guess.” Then a cautious advance of a few\r\nsteps, setting his feet down softly like a hunting cat, and questioning\r\nthe air as to the scent he had caught until all doubt vanished. Then he\r\ncame back to me, looked me in the face, and with his speaking eyes\r\nreported a bear near by; then led on softly, careful, like an\r\nexperienced hunter, not to make the slightest noise; and frequently\r\nlooking back as if whispering, “Yes, it’s a bear; come and I’ll show\r\nyou.” Presently we came to where the sunbeams were streaming through\r\nbetween the purple shafts of the firs, which showed that we were nearing\r\nan open spot, and here Carlo came behind me, evidently sure that the\r\nbear was very near. So I crept to a low ridge of moraine boulders on the\r\nedge of a narrow garden meadow, and in this meadow I felt pretty sure\r\nthe bear must be. I was anxious to get a good look at the sturdy\r\nmountaineer without alarming him; so drawing myself up noiselessly back\r\nof one of the largest of the trees I peered past its bulging buttresses,\r\nexposing only a part of my head, and there stood neighbor Bruin within\r\na stone’s throw, his hips covered by tall grass and flowers, and his\r\nfront feet on the trunk of a fir that had fallen out into the meadow,\r\nwhich raised his head so high that he seemed to be standing erect. He\r\nhad not yet seen me, but was looking and listening attentively, showing\r\nthat in some way he was aware of our approach. I watched his gestures\r\nand tried to make the most of my opportunity to learn what I could about\r\nhim, fearing he would catch sight of me and run away. For I had been\r\ntold that this sort of bear, the cinnamon, always ran from his bad\r\nbrother man, never showing fight unless wounded or in defense of young.\r\nHe made a telling picture standing alert in the sunny forest garden. How\r\nwell he played his part, harmonizing in bulk and color and shaggy hair\r\nwith the trunks of the trees and lush vegetation, as natural a feature\r\nas any other in the landscape. After examining at leisure, noting the\r\nsharp muzzle thrust inquiringly forward, the long shaggy hair on his\r\nbroad chest, the stiff, erect ears nearly buried in hair, and the slow,\r\nheavy way he moved his head, I thought I should like to see his gait in\r\nrunning, so I made a sudden rush at him, shouting and swinging my hat to\r\nfrighten him, expecting to see him make haste to get away. But to my\r\ndismay he did not run or show any sign of running. On the contrary, he\r\nstood his ground ready to fight and defend himself, lowered his head,\r\nthrust it forward, and looked sharply and fiercely at me. Then I\r\nsuddenly began to fear that upon me would fall the work of running; but\r\nI was afraid to run, and therefore, like the bear, held my ground. We\r\nstood staring at each other in solemn silence within a dozen yards or\r\nthereabouts, while I fervently hoped that the power of the human eye\r\nover wild beasts would prove as great as it is said to be. How long our\r\nawfully strenuous interview lasted, I don’t know; but at length in the\r\nslow fullness of time he pulled his huge paws down off the log, and with\r\nmagnificent deliberation turned and walked leisurely up the meadow,\r\nstopping frequently to look back over his shoulder to see whether I was\r\npursuing him, then moving on again, evidently neither fearing me very\r\nmuch nor trusting me. He was probably about five hundred pounds in\r\nweight, a broad, rusty bundle of ungovernable wildness, a happy fellow\r\nwhose lines have fallen in pleasant places. The flowery glade in which I\r\nsaw him so well, framed like a picture, is one of the best of all I have\r\nyet discovered, a conservatory of Nature’s precious plant people. Tall\r\nlilies were swinging their bells over that bear’s back, with geraniums,\r\nlarkspurs, columbines, and daisies brushing against his sides. A place\r\nfor angels, one would say, instead of bears.\r\n\r\nIn the great cañons Bruin reigns supreme. Happy fellow, whom no famine\r\ncan reach while one of his thousand kinds of food is spared him. His\r\nbread is sure at all seasons, ranged on the mountain shelves like stores\r\nin a pantry. From one to the other, up or down he climbs, tasting and\r\nenjoying each in turn in different climates, as if he had journeyed\r\nthousands of miles to other countries north or south to enjoy their\r\nvaried productions. I should like to know my hairy brothers\r\nbetter—though after this particular Yosemite bear, my very neighbor,\r\nhad sauntered out of sight this morning, I reluctantly went back to camp\r\nfor the Don’s rifle to shoot him, if necessary, in defense of the flock.\r\nFortunately I couldn’t find him, and after tracking him a mile or two\r\ntowards Mount Hoffman I bade him Godspeed and gladly returned to my work\r\non the Yosemite Dome.\r\n\r\nThe house-fly also seemed at home and buzzed about me as I sat\r\nsketching, and enjoying my bear interview now it was over. I wonder what\r\ndraws house-flies so far up the mountains, heavy gross feeders as they\r\nare, sensitive to cold, and fond of domestic ease. How have they been\r\ndistributed from continent to continent, across seas and deserts and\r\nmountain chains, usually so influential in determining boundaries of\r\nspecies both of plants and animals. Beetles and butterflies are\r\nsometimes restricted to small areas. Each mountain in a range, and even\r\nthe different zones of a mountain, may have its own peculiar species.\r\nBut the house-fly seems to be everywhere. I wonder if any island in\r\nmid-ocean is flyless. The bluebottle is abundant in these Yosemite\r\nwoods, ever ready with his marvelous store of eggs to make all dead\r\nflesh fly. Bumblebees are here, and are well fed on boundless stores of\r\nnectar and pollen. The honeybee, though abundant in the foothills, has\r\nnot yet got so high. It is only a few years since the first swarm was\r\nbrought to California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACK OF SINGING DANCING GRASSHOPPER IN THE AIR OVER\r\nNORTH DOME]\r\n\r\nA queer fellow and a jolly fellow is the grasshopper. Up the mountains\r\nhe comes on excursions, how high I don’t know, but at least as far and\r\nhigh as Yosemite tourists. I was much interested with the hearty\r\nenjoyment of the one that danced and sang for me on the Dome this\r\nafternoon. He seemed brimful of glad, hilarious energy, manifested by\r\nspringing into the air to a height of twenty or thirty feet, then\r\ndiving and springing up again and making a sharp musical rattle just as\r\nthe lowest point in the descent was reached. Up and down a dozen times\r\nor so he danced and sang, then alighted to rest, then up and at it\r\nagain. The curves he described in the air in diving and rattling\r\nresembled those made by cords hanging loosely and attached at the same\r\nheight at the ends, the loops nearly covering each other. Braver,\r\nheartier, keener, care-free enjoyment of life I have never seen or heard\r\nin any creature, great or small. The life of this comic redlegs, the\r\nmountain’s merriest child, seems to be made up of pure, condensed\r\ngayety. The Douglas squirrel is the only living creature that I can\r\ncompare him with in exuberant, rollicking, irrepressible jollity.\r\nWonderful that these sublime mountains are so loudly cheered and\r\nbrightened by a creature so queer. Nature in him seems to be snapping\r\nher fingers in the face of all earthly dejection and melancholy with a\r\nboyish hip-hip-hurrah. How the sound is made I do not understand. When\r\nhe was on the ground he made not the slightest noise, nor when he was\r\nsimply flying from place to place, but only when diving in curves, the\r\nmotion seeming to be required for the sound; for the more vigorous the\r\ndiving the more energetic the corresponding outbursts of jolly\r\nrattling. I tried to observe him closely while he was resting in the\r\nintervals of his performances; but he would not allow a near approach,\r\nalways getting his jumping legs ready to spring for immediate flight,\r\nand keeping his eyes on me. A fine sermon the little fellow danced for\r\nme on the Dome, a likely place to look for sermons in stones, but not\r\nfor grasshopper sermons. A large and imposing pulpit for so small a\r\npreacher. No danger of weakness in the knees of the world while Nature\r\ncan spring such a rattle as this. Even the bear did not express for me\r\nthe mountain’s wild health and strength and happiness so tellingly as\r\ndid this comical little hopper. No cloud of care in his day, no winter\r\nof discontent in sight. To him every day is a holiday; and when at\r\nlength his sun sets, I fancy he will cuddle down on the forest floor and\r\ndie like the leaves and flowers, and like them leave no unsightly\r\nremains calling for burial.\r\n\r\nSundown, and I must to camp. Good-night, friends three,—brown bear,\r\nrugged boulder of energy in groves and gardens fair as Eden; restless,\r\nfussy fly with gauzy wings stirring the air around all the world; and\r\ngrasshopper, crisp, electric spark of joy enlivening the massy sublimity\r\nof the mountains like the laugh of a child. Thank you, thank you all\r\nthree for your quickening company. Heaven guide every wing and leg.\r\nGood-night friends three, good-night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MT. CLARK TOP OF S. DOME MT. STARR KING\r\n\r\nABIES MAGNIFICA]\r\n\r\n_July 22._ A fine specimen of the black-tailed deer went bounding past\r\ncamp this morning. A buck with wide spread of antlers, showing admirable\r\nvigor and grace. Wonderful the beauty, strength, and graceful movements\r\nof animals in wildernesses, cared for by Nature only, when our\r\nexperience with domestic animals would lead us to fear that all the\r\nso-called neglected wild beasts would degenerate. Yet the upshot of\r\nNature’s method of breeding and teaching seems to lead to excellence of\r\nevery sort. Deer, like all wild animals, are as clean as plants. The\r\nbeauties of their gestures and attitudes, alert or in repose, surprise\r\nyet more than their bounding exuberant strength. Every movement and\r\nposture is graceful, the very poetry of manners and motion. Mother\r\nNature is too often spoken of as in reality no mother at all. Yet how\r\nwisely, sternly, tenderly she loves and looks after her children in all\r\nsorts of weather and wildernesses. The more I see of deer the more I\r\nadmire them as mountaineers. They make their way into the heart of the\r\nroughest solitudes with smooth reserve of strength, through dense belts\r\nof brush and forest encumbered with fallen trees and boulder piles,\r\nacross cañons, roaring streams, and snow-fields, ever showing forth\r\nbeauty and courage. Over nearly all the continent the deer find homes.\r\nIn the Florida savannas and hummocks, in the Canada woods, in the far\r\nnorth, roaming over mossy tundras, swimming lakes and rivers and arms of\r\nthe sea from island to island washed with waves, or climbing rocky\r\nmountains, everywhere healthy and able, adding beauty to every\r\nlandscape,—a truly admirable creature and great credit to Nature.\r\n\r\nHave been sketching a silver fir that stands on a granite ridge a few\r\nhundred yards to the eastward of camp—a fine tree with a particular\r\nsnow-storm story to tell. It is about one hundred feet high, growing on\r\nbare rock, thrusting its roots into a weathered joint less than an inch\r\nwide, and bulging out to form a base to bear its weight. The storm came\r\nfrom the north while it was young and broke it down nearly to the\r\nground, as is shown by the old, dead, weather-beaten top leaning out\r\nfrom the living trunk built up from a new shoot below the break. The\r\nannual rings of the trunk that have overgrown the dead sapling tell the\r\nyear of the storm. Wonderful that a side branch forming a portion of one\r\nof the level collars that encircle the trunk of this species (_Abies\r\nmagnifica_) should bend upward, grow erect, and take the place of the\r\nlost axis to form a new tree.\r\n\r\nMany others, pines as well as firs, bear testimony to the crushing\r\nseverity of this particular storm. Trees, some of them fifty to\r\nseventy-five feet high, were bent to the ground and buried like grass,\r\nwhole groves vanishing as if the forest had been cleared away, leaving\r\nnot a branch or needle visible until the spring thaw. Then the more\r\nelastic undamaged saplings rose again, aided by the wind, some reaching\r\na nearly erect attitude, others remaining more or less bent, while those\r\nwith broken backs endeavored to specialize a side branch below the break\r\nand make a leader of it to form a new axis of development. It is as if a\r\nman, whose back was broken or nearly so and who was compelled to go\r\nbent, should find a branch backbone sprouting straight up from below the\r\nbreak and should gradually develop new arms and shoulders and head,\r\nwhile the old damaged portion of his body died.\r\n\r\nGrand white cloud mountains and domes created about noon as usual,\r\nridges and ranges of endless variety, as if Nature dearly loved this\r\nsort of work, doing it again and again nearly every day with infinite\r\nindustry, and producing beauty that never palls. A few zigzags of\r\nlightning, five minutes’ shower, then a gradual wilting and clearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATING GROWTH OF NEW PINE FROM BRANCH BELOW THE\r\nBREAK OF AXIS OF SNOW-CRUSHED TREE]\r\n\r\n_July 23._ Another midday cloudland, displaying power and beauty that\r\none never wearies in beholding, but hopelessly unsketchable and\r\nuntellable. What can poor mortals say about clouds? While a description\r\nof their huge glowing domes and ridges, shadowy gulfs and cañons, and\r\nfeather-edged ravines is being tried, they vanish, leaving no visible\r\nruins. Nevertheless, these fleeting sky mountains are as substantial and\r\nsignificant as the more lasting upheavals of granite beneath them. Both\r\nalike are built up and die, and in God’s calendar difference of duration\r\nis nothing. We can only dream about them in wondering, worshiping\r\nadmiration, happier than we dare tell even to friends who see farthest\r\nin sympathy, glad to know that not a crystal or vapor particle of them,\r\nhard or soft, is lost; that they sink and vanish only to rise again and\r\nagain in higher and higher beauty. As to our own work, duty, influence,\r\netc., concerning which so much fussy pother is made, it will not fail of\r\nits due effect, though, like a lichen on a stone, we keep silent.\r\n\r\n_July 24._ Clouds at noon occupying about half the sky gave half an hour\r\nof heavy rain to wash one of the cleanest landscapes in the world. How\r\nwell it is washed! The sea is hardly less dusty than the ice-burnished\r\npavements and ridges, domes and cañons, and summit peaks plashed with\r\nsnow like waves with foam. How fresh the woods are and calm after the\r\nlast films of clouds have been wiped from the sky! A few minutes ago\r\nevery tree was excited, bowing to the roaring storm, waving, swirling,\r\ntossing their branches in glorious enthusiasm like worship. But though\r\nto the outer ear these trees are now silent, their songs never cease.\r\nEvery hidden cell is throbbing with music and life, every fibre\r\nthrilling like harp strings, while incense is ever flowing from the\r\nbalsam bells and leaves. No wonder the hills and groves were God’s first\r\ntemples, and the more they are cut down and hewn into cathedrals and\r\nchurches, the farther off and dimmer seems the Lord himself. The same\r\nmay be said of stone temples. Yonder, to the eastward of our camp grove,\r\nstands one of Nature’s cathedrals, hewn from the living rock, almost\r\nconventional in form, about two thousand feet high, nobly adorned with\r\nspires and pinnacles, thrilling under floods of sunshine as if alive\r\nlike a grove-temple, and well named “Cathedral Peak.” Even Shepherd\r\nBilly turns at times to this wonderful mountain building, though\r\napparently deaf to all stone sermons. Snow that refused to melt in fire\r\nwould hardly be more wonderful than unchanging dullness in the rays of\r\nGod’s beauty. I have been trying to get him to walk to the brink of\r\nYosemite for a view, offering to watch the sheep for a day, while he\r\nshould enjoy what tourists come from all over the world to see. But\r\nthough within a mile of the famous valley, he will not go to it even out\r\nof mere curiosity. “What,” says he, “is Yosemite but a cañon—a lot of\r\nrocks—a hole in the ground—a place dangerous about falling into—a\r\nd——d good place to keep away from.” “But think of the waterfalls,\r\nBilly—just think of that big stream we crossed the other day, falling\r\nhalf a mile through the air—think of that, and the sound it makes. You\r\ncan hear it now like the roar of the sea.” Thus I pressed Yosemite upon\r\nhim like a missionary offering the gospel, but he would have none of it.\r\n“I should be afraid to look over so high a wall,” he said. “It would\r\nmake my head swim. There is nothing worth seeing anywhere, only rocks,\r\nand I see plenty of them here. Tourists that spend their money to see\r\nrocks and falls are fools, that’s all. You can’t humbug me. I’ve been in\r\nthis country too long for that.” Such souls, I suppose, are asleep, or\r\nsmothered and befogged beneath mean pleasures and cares.\r\n\r\n_July 25._ Another cloudland. Some clouds have an over-ripe decaying\r\nlook, watery and bedraggled and drawn out into wind-torn shreds and\r\npatches, giving the sky a littered appearance; not so these Sierra\r\nsummer midday clouds. All are beautiful with smooth definite outlines\r\nand curves like those of glacier-polished domes. They begin to grow\r\nabout eleven o’clock, and seem so wonderfully near and clear from this\r\nhigh camp one is tempted to try to climb them and trace the streams that\r\npour like cataracts from their shadowy fountains. The rain to which they\r\ngive birth is often very heavy, a sort of waterfall as imposing as if\r\npouring from rock mountains. Never in all my travels have I found\r\nanything more truly novel and interesting than these midday mountains of\r\nthe sky, their fine tones of color, majestic visible growth, and\r\never-changing scenery and general effects, though mostly as well let\r\nalone as far as description goes. I oftentimes think of Shelley’s cloud\r\npoem, “I sift the snow on the mountains below.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMOUNT HOFFMAN AND LAKE TENAYA\r\n\r\n\r\n_July 26._ Ramble to the summit of Mount Hoffman, eleven thousand feet\r\nhigh, the highest point in life’s journey my feet have yet touched. And\r\nwhat glorious landscapes are about me, new plants, new animals, new\r\ncrystals, and multitudes of new mountains far higher than Hoffman,\r\ntowering in glorious array along the axis of the range, serene,\r\nmajestic, snow-laden, sun-drenched, vast domes and ridges shining below\r\nthem, forests, lakes, and meadows in the hollows, the pure blue\r\nbell-flower sky brooding them all,—a glory day of admission into a new\r\nrealm of wonders as if Nature had wooingly whispered, “Come higher.”\r\nWhat questions I asked, and how little I know of all the vast show, and\r\nhow eagerly, tremulously hopeful of some day knowing more, learning the\r\nmeaning of these divine symbols crowded together on this wondrous page.\r\n\r\nMount Hoffman is the highest part of a ridge or spur about fourteen\r\nmiles from the axis of the main range, perhaps a remnant brought into\r\nrelief and isolated by unequal denudation. The southern slopes shed\r\ntheir waters into Yosemite Valley by Tenaya and Dome Creeks, the\r\nnorthern in part into the Tuolumne River, but mostly into the Merced by\r\nYosemite Creek. The rock is mostly granite, with some small piles and\r\ncrests rising here and there in picturesque pillared and castellated\r\nremnants of red metamorphic slates. Both the granite and slates are\r\ndivided by joints, making them separable into blocks like the stones of\r\nartificial masonry, suggesting the Scripture “He hath builded the\r\nmountains.” Great banks of snow and ice are piled in hollows on the cool\r\nprecipitous north side forming the highest perennial sources of Yosemite\r\nCreek. The southern slopes are much more gradual and accessible. Narrow\r\nslot-like gorges extend across the summit at right angles, which look\r\nlike lanes, formed evidently by the erosion of less resisting beds. They\r\nare usually called “devil’s slides,” though they lie far above the\r\nregion usually haunted by the devil; for though we read that he once\r\nclimbed an exceeding high mountain, he cannot be much of a mountaineer,\r\nfor his tracks are seldom seen above the timber-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPROACH OF DOME CREEK TO YOSEMITE]\r\n\r\nThe broad gray summit is barren and desolate-looking in general views,\r\nwasted by ages of gnawing storms; but looking at the surface in detail,\r\none finds it covered by thousands and millions of charming plants\r\nwith leaves and flowers so small they form no mass of color visible at a\r\ndistance of a few hundred yards. Beds of azure daisies smile confidingly\r\nin moist hollows, and along the banks of small rills, with several\r\nspecies of eriogonum, silky-leaved ivesia, pentstemon, orthocarpus, and\r\npatches of _Primula suffruticosa_, a beautiful shrubby species. Here\r\nalso I found bryanthus, a charming heathwort covered with purple flowers\r\nand dark green foliage like heather, and three trees new to me—a\r\nhemlock and two pines. The hemlock (_Tsuga Mertensiana_) is the most\r\nbeautiful conifer I have ever seen; the branches and also the main axis\r\ndroop in a singularly graceful way, and the dense foliage covers the\r\ndelicate, sensitive, swaying branchlets all around. It is now in full\r\nbloom, and the flowers, together with thousands of last season’s cones\r\nstill clinging to the drooping sprays, display wonderful wealth of\r\ncolor, brown and purple and blue. Gladly I climbed the first tree I\r\nfound to revel in the midst of it. How the touch of the flowers makes\r\none’s flesh tingle! The pistillate are dark, rich purple, and almost\r\ntranslucent, the staminate blue,—a vivid, pure tone of blue like the\r\nmountain sky,—the most uncommonly beautiful of all the Sierra tree\r\nflowers I have seen. How wonderful that, with all its delicate feminine\r\ngrace and beauty of form and dress and behavior, this lovely tree up\r\nhere, exposed to the wildest blasts, has already endured the storms of\r\ncenturies of winters!\r\n\r\nThe two pines also are brave storm-enduring trees, the mountain pine\r\n(_Pinus monticola_) and the dwarf pine (_Pinus albicaulis_). The\r\nmountain pine is closely related to the sugar pine, though the cones are\r\nonly about four to six inches long. The largest trees are from five to\r\nsix feet in diameter at four feet above the ground, the bark rich brown.\r\nOnly a few storm-beaten adventurers approach the summit of the mountain.\r\nThe dwarf or white-bark pine is the species that forms the timber-line,\r\nwhere it is so completely dwarfed that one may walk over the top of a\r\nbed of it as over snow-pressed chaparral.\r\n\r\nHow boundless the day seems as we revel in these storm-beaten sky\r\ngardens amid so vast a congregation of onlooking mountains! Strange and\r\nadmirable it is that the more savage and chilly and storm-chafed the\r\nmountains, the finer the glow on their faces and the finer the plants\r\nthey bear. The myriads of flowers tingeing the mountain-top do not seem\r\nto have grown out of the dry, rough gravel of disintegration, but rather\r\nthey appear as visitors, a cloud of witnesses to Nature’s love in what\r\nwe in our timid ignorance and unbelief call howling desert. The surface\r\nof the ground, so dull and forbidding at first sight, besides being rich\r\nin plants, shines and sparkles with crystals: mica, hornblende,\r\nfeldspar, quartz, tourmaline. The radiance in some places is so great as\r\nto be fairly dazzling, keen lance rays of every color flashing,\r\nsparkling in glorious abundance, joining the plants in their fine, brave\r\nbeauty-work—every crystal, every flower a window opening into heaven, a\r\nmirror reflecting the Creator.\r\n\r\nFrom garden to garden, ridge to ridge, I drifted enchanted, now on my\r\nknees gazing into the face of a daisy, now climbing again and again\r\namong the purple and azure flowers of the hemlocks, now down into the\r\ntreasuries of the snow, or gazing afar over domes and peaks, lakes and\r\nwoods, and the billowy glaciated fields of the upper Tuolumne, and\r\ntrying to sketch them. In the midst of such beauty, pierced with its\r\nrays, one’s body is all one tingling palate. Who wouldn’t be a\r\nmountaineer! Up here all the world’s prizes seem nothing.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the many glacier lakes in sight, and the one with the\r\nfinest shore scenery, is Tenaya, about a mile long, with an imposing\r\nmountain dipping its feet into it on the south side, Cathedral Peak a\r\nfew miles above its head, many smooth swelling rock-waves and domes on\r\nthe north, and in the distance southward a multitude of snowy peaks, the\r\nfountain-heads of rivers. Lake Hoffman lies shimmering beneath my feet,\r\nmountain pines around its shining rim. To the northward the picturesque\r\nbasin of Yosemite Creek glitters with lakelets and pools; but the eye is\r\nsoon drawn away from these bright mirror wells, however attractive, to\r\nrevel in the glorious congregation of peaks on the axis of the range in\r\ntheir robes of snow and light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cathedral Peak]\r\n\r\nCarlo caught an unfortunate woodchuck when it was running from a grassy\r\nspot to its boulder-pile home—one of the hardiest of the mountain\r\nanimals. I tried hard to save him, but in vain. After telling Carlo that\r\nhe must be careful not to kill anything, I caught sight, for the first\r\ntime, of the curious pika, or little chief hare, that cuts large\r\nquantities of lupines and other plants and lays them out to dry in the\r\nsun for hay, which it stores in underground barns to last through the\r\nlong, snowy winter. Coming upon these plants freshly cut and lying in\r\nhandfuls here and there on the rocks has a startling effect of busy life\r\non the lonely mountain-top. These little haymakers, endowed with\r\nbrain stuff something like our own,—God up here looking after\r\nthem,—what lessons they teach, how they widen our sympathy!\r\n\r\nAn eagle soaring above a sheer cliff, where I suppose its nest is, makes\r\nanother striking show of life, and helps to bring to mind the other\r\npeople of the so-called solitude—deer in the forest caring for their\r\nyoung; the strong, well-clad, well-fed bears; the lively throng of\r\nsquirrels; the blessed birds, great and small, stirring and sweetening\r\nthe groves; and the clouds of happy insects filling the sky with joyous\r\nhum as part and parcel of the down-pouring sunshine. All these come to\r\nmind, as well as the plant people, and the glad streams singing their\r\nway to the sea. But most impressive of all is the vast glowing\r\ncountenance of the wilderness in awful, infinite repose.\r\n\r\nToward sunset, enjoyed a fine run to camp, down the long south slopes,\r\nacross ridges and ravines, gardens and avalanche gaps, through the firs\r\nand chaparral, enjoying wild excitement and excess of strength, and so\r\nends a day that will never end.\r\n\r\n_July 27._ Up and away to Lake Tenaya,—another big day, enough for a\r\nlifetime. The rocks, the air, everything speaking with audible voice or\r\nsilent; joyful, wonderful, enchanting, banishing weariness and sense of\r\ntime. No longing for anything now or hereafter as we go home into the\r\nmountain’s heart. The level sunbeams are touching the fir-tops, every\r\nleaf shining with dew. Am holding an easterly course, the deep cañon of\r\nTenaya Creek on the right hand, Mount Hoffman on the left, and the lake\r\nstraight ahead about ten miles distant, the summit of Mount Hoffman\r\nabout three thousand feet above me, Tenaya Creek four thousand feet\r\nbelow and separated from the shallow, irregular valley, along which most\r\nof the way lies, by smooth domes and wave-ridges. Many mossy emerald\r\nbogs, meadows, and gardens in rocky hollows to wade and saunter\r\nthrough—and what fine plants they give me, what joyful streams I have\r\nto cross, and how many views are displayed of the Hoffman and Cathedral\r\nPeak masonry, and what a wondrous breadth of shining granite pavement to\r\nwalk over for the first time about the shores of the lake! On I\r\nsauntered in freedom complete; body without weight as far as I was\r\naware; now wading through starry parnassia bogs, now through gardens\r\nshoulder deep in larkspur and lilies, grasses and rushes, shaking off\r\nshowers of dew; crossing piles of crystalline moraine boulders, bright\r\nmirror pavements, and cool, cheery streams going to Yosemite; crossing\r\nbryanthus carpets and the scoured pathways of avalanches, and thickets\r\nof snow-pressed ceanothus; then down a broad, majestic stairway into the\r\nice-sculptured lake-basin.\r\n\r\nThe snow on the high mountains is melting fast, and the streams are\r\nsinging bank-full, swaying softly through the level meadows and bogs,\r\nquivering with sun-spangles, swirling in pot-holes, resting in deep\r\npools, leaping, shouting in wild, exulting energy over rough boulder\r\ndams, joyful, beautiful in all their forms. No Sierra landscape that I\r\nhave seen holds anything truly dead or dull, or any trace of what in\r\nmanufactories is called rubbish or waste; everything is perfectly clean\r\nand pure and full of divine lessons. This quick, inevitable interest\r\nattaching to everything seems marvelous until the hand of God becomes\r\nvisible; then it seems reasonable that what interests Him may well\r\ninterest us. When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it\r\nhitched to everything else in the universe. One fancies a heart like our\r\nown must be beating in every crystal and cell, and we feel like stopping\r\nto speak to the plants and animals as friendly fellow mountaineers.\r\nNature as a poet, an enthusiastic workingman, becomes more and more\r\nvisible the farther and higher we go; for the mountains are\r\nfountains—beginning places, however related to sources beyond mortal\r\nken.\r\n\r\nI found three kinds of meadows: (1) Those contained in basins not yet\r\nfilled with earth enough to make a dry surface. They are planted with\r\nseveral species of carex, and have their margins diversified with robust\r\nflowering plants such as veratrum, larkspur, lupine, etc. (2) Those\r\ncontained in the same sort of basins, once lakes like the first, but so\r\nsituated in relation to the streams that flow through them and beds of\r\ntransportable sand, gravel, etc., that they are now high and dry and\r\nwell drained. This dry condition and corresponding difference in their\r\nvegetation may be caused by no superiority of position, or power of\r\ntransporting filling material in the streams that belong to them, but\r\nsimply by the basin being shallow and therefore sooner filled. They are\r\nplanted with grasses, mostly fine, silky, and rather short-leaved,\r\n_Calamagrostis_ and _Agrostis_ being the principal genera. They form\r\ndelightfully smooth, level sods in which one finds two or three species\r\nof gentian and as many of purple and yellow orthocarpus, violet,\r\nvaccinium, kalmia, bryanthus, and lonicera. (3) Meadows hanging on ridge\r\nand mountain slopes, not in basins at all, but made and held in place\r\nby masses of boulders and fallen trees, which, forming dams one above\r\nanother in close succession on small, outspread, channelless streams,\r\nhave collected soil enough for the growth of grasses, carices, and many\r\nflowering plants, and being kept well watered, without being subject to\r\ncurrents sufficiently strong to carry them away, a hanging or sloping\r\nmeadow is the result. Their surfaces are seldom so smooth as the others,\r\nbeing roughened more or less by the projecting tops of the dam rocks or\r\nlogs; but at a little distance this roughness is not noticed, and the\r\neffect is very striking—bright green, fluent, down-sweeping flowery\r\nribbons on gray slopes. The broad shallow streams these meadows belong\r\nto are mostly derived from banks of snow and because the soil is well\r\ndrained in some places, while in others the dam rocks are packed close\r\nand caulked with bits of wood and leaves, making boggy patches; the\r\nvegetation, of course, is correspondingly varied. I saw patches of\r\nwillow, bryanthus, and a fine show of lilies on some of them, not\r\nforming a margin, but scattered about among the carex and grass. Most of\r\nthese meadows are now in their prime. How wonderful must be the temper\r\nof the elastic leaves of grasses and sedges to make curves so perfect\r\nand fine. Tempered a little harder, they would stand erect, stiff and\r\nbristly, like strips of metal; a little softer, and every leaf would lie\r\nflat. And what fine painting and tinting there is on the glumes and\r\npales, stamens and feathery pistils. Butterflies colored like the\r\nflowers waver above them in wonderful profusion, and many other\r\nbeautiful winged people, numbered and known and loved only by the Lord,\r\nare waltzing together high over head, seemingly in pure play and\r\nhilarious enjoyment of their little sparks of life. How wonderful they\r\nare! How do they get a living, and endure the weather? How are their\r\nlittle bodies, with muscles, nerves, organs, kept warm and jolly in such\r\nadmirable exuberant health? Regarded only as mechanical inventions, how\r\nwonderful they are! Compared with these, Godlike man’s greatest machines\r\nare as nothing.\r\n\r\nMost of the sandy gardens on moraines are in prime beauty like the\r\nmeadows, though some on the north sides of rocks and beneath groves of\r\nsapling pines have not yet bloomed. On sunny sheets of crystal soil\r\nalong the slopes of the Hoffman Mountains, I saw extensive patches of\r\nivesia and purple gilia with scarce a green leaf, making fine clouds of\r\ncolor. Ribes bushes, vaccinium, and kalmia, now in flower, make\r\nbeautiful rugs and borders along the banks of the streams. Shaggy beds\r\nof dwarf oak (_Quercus chrysolepis_, var. _vaccinifolia_) over which one\r\nmay walk are common on rocky moraines, yet this is the same species as\r\nthe large live oak seen near Brown’s Flat. The most beautiful of the\r\nshrubs is the purple-flowered bryanthus, here making glorious carpets at\r\nan elevation of nine thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe principal tree for the first mile or two from camp is the\r\nmagnificent silver fir, which reaches perfection here both in size and\r\nform of individual trees, and in the mode of grouping in groves with\r\nopen spaces between. So trim and tasteful are these silvery, spiry\r\ngroves one would fancy they must have been placed in position by some\r\nmaster landscape gardener, their regularity seeming almost conventional.\r\nBut Nature is the only gardener able to do work so fine. A few noble\r\nspecimens two hundred feet high occupy central positions in the groups\r\nwith younger trees around them; and outside of these another circle of\r\nyet smaller ones, the whole arranged like tastefully symmetrical\r\nbouquets, every tree fitting nicely the place assigned to it as if made\r\nespecially for it; small roses and eriogonums are usually found blooming\r\non the open spaces about the groves, forming charming pleasure grounds.\r\nHigher, the firs gradually become smaller and less perfect, many\r\nshowing double summits, indicating storm stress. Still, where good\r\nmoraine soil is found, even on the rim of the lake-basin, specimens one\r\nhundred and fifty feet in height and five feet in diameter occur nearly\r\nnine thousand feet above the sea. The saplings, I find, are mostly bent\r\nwith the crushing weight of the winter snow, which at this elevation\r\nmust be at least eight or ten feet deep, judging by marks on the trees;\r\nand this depth of compacted snow is heavy enough to bend and bury young\r\ntrees twenty or thirty feet in height and hold them down for four or\r\nfive months. Some are broken; the others spring up when the snow melts\r\nand at length attain a size that enables them to withstand the snow\r\npressure. Yet even in trees five feet thick the traces of this early\r\ndiscipline are still plainly to be seen in their curved insteps, and\r\nfrequently in old dried saplings protruding from the trunk, partially\r\novergrown by the new axis developed from a branch below the break. Yet\r\nthrough all this stress the forest is maintained in marvelous beauty.\r\n\r\nBeyond the silver firs I find the two-leaved pine (_Pinus contorta_,\r\nvar. _Murrayana_) forms the bulk of the forest up to an elevation of ten\r\nthousand feet or more—the highest timber-belt of the Sierra. I saw a\r\nspecimen nearly five feet in diameter growing on deep, well-watered\r\nsoil at an elevation of about nine thousand feet. The form of this\r\nspecies varies very much with position, exposure, soil, etc. On\r\nstream-banks, where it is closely planted, it is very slender; some\r\nspecimens seventy-five feet high do not exceed five inches in diameter\r\nat the ground, but the ordinary form, as far as I have seen, is well\r\nproportioned. The average diameter when full grown at this elevation is\r\nabout twelve or fourteen inches, height forty or fifty feet, the\r\nstraggling branches bent up at the end, the bark thin and bedraggled\r\nwith amber-colored resin. The pistillate flowers form little crimson\r\nrosettes a fourth of an inch in diameter on the ends of the branchlets,\r\nmostly hidden in the leaf-tassels; the staminate are about three eighths\r\nof an inch in diameter, sulphur-yellow, in showy clusters, giving a\r\nremarkably rich effect—a brave, hardy mountaineer pine, growing\r\ncheerily on rough beds of avalanche boulders and joints of rock\r\npavements, as well as in fertile hollows, standing up to the waist in\r\nsnow every winter for centuries, facing a thousand storms and blooming\r\nevery year in colors as bright as those worn by the sun-drenched trees\r\nof the tropics.\r\n\r\nA still hardier mountaineer is the Sierra juniper (_Juniperus\r\noccidentalis_), growing mostly on domes and ridges and glacier\r\npavements. A thickset, sturdy, picturesque highlander, seemingly content\r\nto live for more than a score of centuries on sunshine and snow; a truly\r\nwonderful fellow, dogged endurance expressed in every feature, lasting\r\nabout as long as the granite he stands on. Some are nearly as broad as\r\nhigh. I saw one on the shore of the lake nearly ten feet in diameter,\r\nand many six to eight feet. The bark, cinnamon-colored, flakes off in\r\nlong ribbon-like strips with a satiny luster. Surely the most enduring\r\nof all tree mountaineers, it never seems to die a natural death, or even\r\nto fall after it has been killed. If protected from accidents, it would\r\nperhaps be immortal. I saw some that had withstood an avalanche from\r\nsnowy Mount Hoffman cheerily putting out new branches, as if repeating,\r\nlike Grip, “Never say die.” Some were simply standing on the pavement\r\nwhere no fissure more than half an inch wide offered a hold for its\r\nroots. The common height for these rock-dwellers is from ten to twenty\r\nfeet; most of the old ones have broken tops, and are mere stumps, with a\r\nfew tufted branches, forming picturesque brown pillars on bare\r\npavements, with plenty of elbow-room and a clear view in every\r\ndirection. On good moraine soil it reaches a height of from forty to\r\nsixty feet, with dense gray foliage. The rings of the trunk are very\r\nthin, eighty to an inch of diameter in some specimens I examined. Those\r\nten feet in diameter must be very old—thousands of years. Wish I could\r\nlive, like these junipers, on sunshine and snow, and stand beside them\r\non the shore of Lake Tenaya for a thousand years. How much I should see,\r\nand how delightful it would be! Everything in the mountains would find\r\nme and come to me, and everything from the heavens like light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNIPERS IN TENAYA CA—ON]\r\n\r\nThe lake was named for one of the chiefs of the Yosemite tribe. Old\r\nTenaya is said to have been a good Indian to his tribe. When a company\r\nof soldiers followed his band into Yosemite to punish them for\r\ncattle-stealing and other crimes, they fled to this lake by a trail that\r\nleads out of the upper end of the valley, early in the spring, while the\r\nsnow was still deep; but being pursued, they lost heart and surrendered.\r\nA fine monument the old man has in this bright lake, and likely to last\r\na long time, though lakes die as well as Indians, being gradually filled\r\nwith detritus carried in by the feeding streams, and to some extent also\r\nby snow avalanches and rain and wind. A considerable portion of the\r\nTenaya basin is already changed into a forested flat and meadow at the\r\nupper end, where the main tributary enters from Cathedral Peak. Two\r\nother tributaries come from the Hoffman Range. The outlet flows westward\r\nthrough Tenaya Cañon to join the Merced River in Yosemite. Scarce a\r\nhandful of loose soil is to be seen on the north shore. All is bare,\r\nshining granite, suggesting the Indian name of the lake, Pywiack,\r\nmeaning shining rock. The basin seems to have been slowly excavated by\r\nthe ancient glaciers, a marvelous work requiring countless thousands of\r\nyears. On the south side an imposing mountain rises from the water’s\r\nedge to a height of three thousand feet or more, feathered with hemlock\r\nand pine; and huge shining domes on the east, over the tops of which the\r\ngrinding, wasting, molding glacier must have swept as the wind does\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n_July 28._ No cloud mountains, only curly cirrus wisps scarce\r\nperceptible, and the want of thunder to strike the noon hour seems\r\nstrange, as if the Sierra clock had stopped. Have been studying the\r\n_magnifica_ fir—measured one near two hundred and forty feet high, the\r\ntallest I have yet seen. This species is the most symmetrical of all\r\nconifers, but though gigantic in size it seldom lives more than four or\r\nfive hundred years. Most of the trees die from the attacks of a fungus\r\nat the age of two or three centuries. This dry-rot fungus perhaps enters\r\nthe trunk by way of the stumps of limbs broken off by the snow that\r\nloads the broad palmate branches. The younger specimens are marvels of\r\nsymmetry, straight and erect as a plumb-line, their branches in regular\r\nlevel whorls of five mostly, each branch as exact in its divisions as a\r\nfern frond, and thickly covered by the leaves, making a rich plush over\r\nall the tree, excepting only the trunk and a small portion of the main\r\nlimbs. The leaves turn upward, especially on the branchlets, and are\r\nstiff and sharp, pointed on all the upper portion of the tree. They\r\nremain on the tree about eight or ten years, and as the growth is rapid\r\nit is not rare to find the leaves still in place on the upper part of\r\nthe axis where it is three to four inches in diameter, wide apart of\r\ncourse, and their spiral arrangement beautifully displayed. The\r\nleaf-scars are conspicuous for twenty years or more, but there is a good\r\ndeal of variation in different trees as to the thickness and sharpness\r\nof the leaves.\r\n\r\nAfter the excursion to Mount Hoffman I had seen a complete cross-section\r\nof the Sierra forest, and I find that _Abies magnifica_ is the most\r\nsymmetrical tree of all the noble coniferous company. The cones are\r\ngrand affairs, superb in form, size, and color, cylindrical, stand\r\nerect on the upper branches like casks, and are from five to eight\r\ninches in length by three or four in diameter, greenish gray, and\r\ncovered with fine down which has a silvery luster in the sunshine, and\r\ntheir brilliance is augmented by beads of transparent balsam which seems\r\nto have been poured over each cone, bringing to mind the old ceremonies\r\nof anointing with oil. If possible, the inside of the cone is more\r\nbeautiful than the outside; the scales, bracts, and seed wings are\r\ntinted with the loveliest rosy purple with a bright lustrous\r\niridescence; the seeds, three fourths of an inch long, are dark brown.\r\nWhen the cones are ripe the scales and bracts fall off, setting the\r\nseeds free to fly to their predestined places, while the dead spike-like\r\naxes are left on the branches for many years to mark the positions of\r\nthe vanished cones, excepting those cut off when green by the Douglas\r\nsquirrel. How he gets his teeth under the broad bases of the sessile\r\ncones, I don’t know. Climbing these trees on a sunny day to visit the\r\ngrowing cones and to gaze over the tops of the forest is one of my best\r\nenjoyments.\r\n\r\n_July 29._ Bright, cool, exhilarating. Clouds about .05. Another\r\nglorious day of rambling, sketching, and universal enjoyment.\r\n\r\n_July 30._ Clouds .20, but the regular shower did not reach us, though\r\nthunder was heard a few miles off striking the noon hour. Ants, flies,\r\nand mosquitoes seem to enjoy this fine climate. A few house-flies have\r\ndiscovered our camp. The Sierra mosquitoes are courageous and of good\r\nsize, some of them measuring nearly an inch from tip of sting to tip of\r\nfolded wings. Though less abundant than in most wildernesses, they\r\noccasionally make quite a hum and stir, and pay but little attention to\r\ntime or place. They sting anywhere, any time of day, wherever they can\r\nfind anything worth while, until they are themselves stung by frost. The\r\nlarge, jet-black ants are only ticklish and troublesome when one is\r\nlying down under the trees. Noticed a borer drilling a silver fir.\r\nOvipositor about an inch and a half in length, polished and straight\r\nlike a needle. When not in use, it is folded back in a sheath, which\r\nextends straight behind like the legs of a crane in flying. This\r\ndrilling, I suppose, is to save nest building, and the after care of\r\nfeeding the young. Who would guess that in the brain of a fly so much\r\nknowledge could find lodgment? How do they know that their eggs will\r\nhatch in such holes, or, after they hatch, that the soft, helpless grubs\r\nwill find the right sort of nourishment in silver fir sap? This\r\ndomestic arrangement calls to mind the curious family of gallflies.\r\nEach species seems to know what kind of plant will respond to the\r\nirritation or stimulus of the puncture it makes and the eggs it lays, in\r\nforming a growth that not only answers for a nest and home but also\r\nprovides food for the young. Probably these gallflies make mistakes at\r\ntimes, like anybody else; but when they do, there is simply a failure of\r\nthat particular brood, while enough to perpetuate the species do find\r\nthe proper plants and nourishment. Many mistakes of this kind might be\r\nmade without being discovered by us. Once a pair of wrens made the\r\nmistake of building a nest in the sleeve of a workman’s coat, which was\r\ncalled for at sundown, much to the consternation and discomfiture of the\r\nbirds. Still the marvel remains that any of the children of such small\r\npeople as gnats and mosquitoes should escape their own and their\r\nparents’ mistakes, as well as the vicissitudes of the weather and hosts\r\nof enemies, and come forth in full vigor and perfection to enjoy the\r\nsunny world. When we think of the small creatures that are visible, we\r\nare led to think of many that are smaller still and lead us on and on\r\ninto infinite mystery.\r\n\r\n_July 31._ Another glorious day, the air as delicious to the lungs as\r\nnectar to the tongue; indeed the body seems one palate, and tingles\r\nequally throughout. Cloudiness about .05, but our ordinary shower has\r\nnot yet reached us, though I hear thunder in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe cheery little chipmunk, so common about Brown’s Flat, is common here\r\nalso, and perhaps other species. In their light, airy habits they recall\r\nthe familiar species of the Eastern States, which we admired in the oak\r\nopenings of Wisconsin as they skimmed along the zigzag rail fences.\r\nThese Sierra chipmunks are more arboreal and squirrel-like. I first\r\nnoticed them on the lower edge of the coniferous belt, where the Sabine\r\nand yellow pines meet,—exceedingly interesting little fellows, full of\r\nodd, funny ways, and without being true squirrels, have most of their\r\naccomplishments without their aggressive quarrelsomeness. I never weary\r\nwatching them as they frisk about in the bushes gathering seeds and\r\nberries, like song sparrows poising daintily on slender twigs, and\r\nmaking even less stir than most birds of the same size. Few of the\r\nSierra animals interest me more; they are so able, gentle, confiding,\r\nand beautiful, they take one’s heart, and get themselves adopted as\r\ndarlings. Though weighing hardly more than field mice, they are\r\nlaborious collectors of seeds, nuts, and cones, and are therefore well\r\nfed, but never in the least swollen with fat or lazily full. On the\r\ncontrary, of their frisky, birdlike liveliness there is no end. They\r\nhave a great variety of notes corresponding with their movements, some\r\nsweet and liquid, like water dripping with tinkling sounds into pools.\r\nThey seem dearly to love teasing a dog, coming frequently almost within\r\nreach, then frisking away with lively chipping, like sparrows, beating\r\ntime to their music with their tails, which at each chip describe half\r\ncircles from side to side. Not even the Douglas squirrel is surer-footed\r\nor more fearless. I have seen them running about on sheer precipices of\r\nthe Yosemite walls seemingly holding on with as little effort as flies,\r\nand as unconscious of danger, where, if the slightest slip were made,\r\nthey would have fallen two or three thousand feet. How fine it would be\r\ncould we mountaineers climb these tremendous cliffs with the same sure\r\ngrip! The venture I made the other day for a view of the Yosemite Fall,\r\nand which tried my nerves so sorely, this little Tamias would have made\r\nfor an ear of grass.\r\n\r\nThe woodchuck (_Arctomys monax_) of the bleak mountain-tops is a very\r\ndifferent sort of mountaineer—the most bovine of rodents, a heavy\r\neater, fat, aldermanic in bulk and fairly bloated, in his high pastures,\r\nlike a cow in a clover field. One woodchuck would outweigh a hundred\r\nchipmunks, and yet he is by no means a dull animal. In the midst of what\r\nwe regard as storm-beaten desolation he pipes and whistles right\r\ncheerily, and enjoys long life in his skyland homes. His burrow is made\r\nin disintegrated rocks or beneath large boulders. Coming out of his den\r\nin the cold hoarfrost mornings, he takes a sun-bath on some favorite\r\nflat-topped rock, then goes to breakfast in garden hollows, eats grass\r\nand flowers until comfortably swollen, then goes a-visiting to fight and\r\nplay. How long a woodchuck lives in this bracing air I don’t know, but\r\nsome of them are rusty and gray like lichen-covered boulders.\r\n\r\n_August 1._ A grand cloudland and five-minute shower, refreshing the\r\nblessed wilderness, already so fragrant and fresh, steeping the black\r\nmeadow mold and dead leaves like tea.\r\n\r\nThe waycup, or flicker, so familiar to every boy in the old Middle West\r\nStates, is one of the most common of the wood-peckers hereabouts, and\r\nmakes one feel at home. I can see no difference in plumage or habits\r\nfrom the Eastern species, though the climate here is so different,—a\r\nfine, brave, confiding, beautiful bird. The robin, too, is here, with\r\nall his familiar notes and gestures, tripping daintily on open garden\r\nspots and high meadows. Over all America he seems to be at home, moving\r\nfrom the plains to the mountains and from north to south, back and\r\nforth, up and down, with the march of the seasons and food supply. How\r\nadmirable the constitution and temper of this brave singer, keeping in\r\ncheery health over so vast and varied a range! Oftentimes, as I wander\r\nthrough these solemn woods, awe-stricken and silent, I hear the\r\nreassuring voice of this fellow wanderer ringing out, sweet and clear,\r\n“Fear not! fear not!”\r\n\r\nThe mountain quail (_Oreortyx ricta_) I often meet in my walks—a small\r\nbrown partridge with a very long, slender, ornamental crest worn\r\njauntily like a feather in a boy’s cap, giving it a very marked\r\nappearance. This species is considerably larger than the valley quail,\r\nso common on the hot foothills. They seldom alight in trees, but love to\r\nwander in flocks of from five or six to twenty through the ceanothus and\r\nmanzanita thickets and over open, dry meadows and rocks of the ridges\r\nwhere the forest is less dense or wanting, uttering a low clucking sound\r\nto enable them to keep together. When disturbed they rise with a strong\r\nbirr of wing-beats, and scatter as if exploded to a distance of a\r\nquarter of a mile or so. After the danger is past they call one another\r\ntogether with a loud piping note—Nature’s beautiful mountain chickens.\r\nI have not yet found their nests. The young of this season are already\r\nhatched and away—new broods of happy wanderers half as large as their\r\nparents. I wonder how they live through the long winters, when the\r\nground is snow-covered ten feet deep. They must go down towards the\r\nlower edge of the forest, like the deer, though I have not heard of them\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe blue, or dusky, grouse is also common here. They like the deepest\r\nand closest fir woods, and when disturbed, burst from the branches of\r\nthe trees with a strong, loud whir of wing-beats, and vanish in a\r\nwavering, silent slide, without moving a feather—a stout, beautiful\r\nbird about the size of the prairie chicken of the old west, spending\r\nmost of the time in the trees, excepting the breeding season, when it\r\nkeeps to the ground. The young are now able to fly. When scattered by\r\nman or dog, they keep still until the danger is supposed to be passed,\r\nthen the mother calls them together. The chicks can hear the call a\r\ndistance of several hundred yards, though it is not loud. Should the\r\nyoung be unable to fly, the mother feigns desperate lameness or death to\r\ndraw one away, throwing herself at one’s feet within two or three yards,\r\nrolling over on her back, kicking and gasping, so as to deceive man or\r\nbeast. They are said to stay all the year in the woods hereabouts,\r\ntaking shelter in dense tufted branches of fir and yellow pine during\r\nsnowstorms, and feeding on the young buds of these trees. Their legs are\r\nfeathered down to their toes, and I have never heard of their suffering\r\nin any sort of weather. Able to live on pine and fir buds, they are\r\nforever independent in the matter of food, which troubles so many of us\r\nand controls our movements. Gladly, if I could, I would live forever on\r\npine buds, however full of turpentine and pitch, for the sake of this\r\ngrand independence. Just to think of our sufferings last month merely\r\nfor grist-mill flour. Man seems to have more difficulty in gaining food\r\nthan any other of the Lord’s creatures. For many in towns it is a\r\nconsuming, lifelong struggle; for others, the danger of coming to want\r\nis so great, the deadly habit of endless hoarding for the future is\r\nformed, which smothers all real life, and is continued long after every\r\nreasonable need has been over-supplied.\r\n\r\nOn Mount Hoffman I saw a curious dove-colored bird that seemed half\r\nwoodpecker, half magpie, or crow. It screams something like a crow, but\r\nflies like a woodpecker, and has a long, straight bill, with which I saw\r\nit opening the cones of the mountain and white-barked pines. It seems\r\nto keep to the heights, though no doubt it comes down for shelter during\r\nwinter, if not for food. So far as food is concerned, these\r\nbird-mountaineers, I guess, can glean nuts enough, even in winter, from\r\nthe different kinds of conifers; for always there are a few that have\r\nbeen unable to fly out of the cones and remain for hungry winter\r\ngleaners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA STRANGE EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 2._ Clouds and showers, about the same as yesterday. Sketching\r\nall day on the North Dome until four or five o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nwhen, as I was busily employed thinking only of the glorious Yosemite\r\nlandscape, trying to draw every tree and every line and feature of the\r\nrocks, I was suddenly, and without warning, possessed with the notion\r\nthat my friend, Professor J. D. Butler, of the State University of\r\nWisconsin, was below me in the valley, and I jumped up full of the idea\r\nof meeting him, with almost as much startling excitement as if he had\r\nsuddenly touched me to make me look up. Leaving my work without the\r\nslightest deliberation, I ran down the western slope of the Dome and\r\nalong the brink of the valley wall, looking for a way to the bottom,\r\nuntil I came to a side cañon, which, judging by its apparently\r\ncontinuous growth of trees and bushes, I thought might afford a\r\npractical way into the valley, and immediately began to make the\r\ndescent, late as it was, as if drawn irresistibly. But after a little,\r\ncommon sense stopped me and explained that it would be long after dark\r\nere I could possibly reach the hotel, that the visitors would be asleep,\r\nthat nobody would know me, that I had no money in my pockets, and\r\nmoreover was without a coat. I therefore compelled myself to stop, and\r\nfinally succeeded in reasoning myself out of the notion of seeking my\r\nfriend in the dark, whose presence I only felt in a strange, telepathic\r\nway. I succeeded in dragging myself back through the woods to camp,\r\nnever for a moment wavering, however, in my determination to go down to\r\nhim next morning. This I think is the most unexplainable notion that\r\never struck me. Had some one whispered in my ear while I sat on the\r\nDome, where I had spent so many days, that Professor Butler was in the\r\nvalley, I could not have been more surprised and startled. When I was\r\nleaving the university, he said, “Now, John, I want to hold you in sight\r\nand watch your career. Promise to write me at least once a year.” I\r\nreceived a letter from him in July, at our first camp in the Hollow,\r\nwritten in May, in which he said that he might possibly visit California\r\nsome time this summer, and therefore hoped to meet me. But inasmuch as\r\nhe named no meeting-place, and gave no directions as to the course he\r\nwould probably follow, and as I should be in the wilderness all summer,\r\nI had not the slightest hope of seeing him, and all thought of the\r\nmatter had vanished from my mind until this afternoon, when he seemed to\r\nbe wafted bodily almost against my face. Well, to-morrow I shall see;\r\nfor, reasonable or unreasonable, I feel I must go.\r\n\r\n_August 3._ Had a wonderful day. Found Professor Butler as the\r\ncompass-needle finds the pole. So last evening’s telepathy,\r\ntranscendental revelation, or whatever else it may be called, was true;\r\nfor, strange to say, he had just entered the valley by way of the\r\nCoulterville Trail and was coming up the valley past El Capitan when his\r\npresence struck me. Had he then looked toward the North Dome with a good\r\nglass when it first came in sight, he might have seen me jump up from my\r\nwork and run toward him. This seems the one well-defined marvel of my\r\nlife of the kind called supernatural; for, absorbed in glad Nature,\r\nspirit-rappings, second sight, ghost stories, etc., have never\r\ninterested me since boyhood, seeming comparatively useless and\r\ninfinitely less wonderful than Nature’s open, harmonious, songful,\r\nsunny, everyday beauty.\r\n\r\nThis morning, when I thought of having to appear among tourists at a\r\nhotel, I was troubled because I had no suitable clothes, and at best am\r\ndesperately bashful and shy. I was determined to go, however, to see my\r\nold friend after two years among strangers; got on a clean pair of\r\noveralls, a cashmere shirt, and a sort of jacket,—the best my camp\r\nwardrobe afforded,—tied my notebook on my belt, and strode away on my\r\nstrange journey, followed by Carlo. I made my way through the gap\r\ndiscovered last evening, which proved to be Indian Cañon. There was no\r\ntrail in it, and the rocks and brush were so rough that Carlo frequently\r\ncalled me back to help him down precipitous places. Emerging from the\r\ncañon shadows, I found a man making hay on one of the meadows, and asked\r\nhim whether Professor Butler was in the valley. “I don’t know,” he\r\nreplied; “but you can easily find out at the hotel. There are but few\r\nvisitors in the valley just now. A small party came in yesterday\r\nafternoon, and I heard some one called Professor Butler, or Butterfield,\r\nor some name like that.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Vernal Falls, Yosemite National Park_]\r\n\r\nIn front of the gloomy hotel I found a tourist party adjusting their\r\nfishing tackle. They all stared at me in silent wonderment, as if I had\r\nbeen seen dropping down through the trees from the clouds, mostly, I\r\nsuppose, on account of my strange garb. Inquiring for the office, I was\r\ntold it was locked, and that the landlord was away, but I might find the\r\nlandlady, Mrs. Hutchings, in the parlor. I entered in a sad state of\r\nembarrassment, and after I had waited in the big, empty room and knocked\r\nat several doors the landlady at length appeared, and in reply to my\r\nquestion said she rather thought Professor Butler _was_ in the valley,\r\nbut to make sure, she would bring the register from the office. Among\r\nthe names of the last arrivals I soon discovered the Professor’s\r\nfamiliar handwriting, at the sight of which bashfulness vanished; and\r\nhaving learned that his party had gone up the valley,—probably to the\r\nVernal and Nevada Falls,—I pushed on in glad pursuit, my heart now sure\r\nof its prey. In less than an hour I reached the head of the Nevada Cañon\r\nat the Vernal Fall, and just outside of the spray discovered a\r\ndistinguished-looking gentleman, who, like everybody else I have seen\r\nto-day, regarded me curiously as I approached. When I made bold to\r\ninquire if he knew where Professor Butler was, he seemed yet more\r\ncurious to know what could possibly have happened that required a\r\nmessenger for the Professor, and instead of answering my question he\r\nasked with military sharpness, “Who wants him?” “I want him,” I replied\r\nwith equal sharpness. “Why? Do _you_ know him?” “Yes,” I said. “Do\r\n_you_ know him?” Astonished that any one in the mountains could possibly\r\nknow Professor Butler and find him as soon as he had reached the valley,\r\nhe came down to meet the strange mountaineer on equal terms, and\r\ncourteously replied, “Yes, I know Professor Butler very well. I am\r\nGeneral Alvord, and we were fellow students in Rutland, Vermont, long\r\nago, when we were both young.” “But where is he now?” I persisted,\r\ncutting short his story. “He has gone beyond the falls with a companion,\r\nto try to climb that big rock, the top of which you see from here.” His\r\nguide now volunteered the information that it was the Liberty Cap\r\nProfessor Butler and his companion had gone to climb, and that if I\r\nwaited at the head of the fall I should be sure to find them on their\r\nway down. I therefore climbed the ladders alongside the Vernal Fall, and\r\nwas pushing forward, determined to go to the top of Liberty Cap rock in\r\nmy hurry, rather than wait, if I should not meet my friend sooner. So\r\nheart-hungry at times may one be to see a friend in the flesh, however\r\nhappily full and care-free one’s life may be. I had gone but a short\r\ndistance, however, above the brow of the Vernal Fall when I caught sight\r\nof him in the brush and rocks, half erect, groping his way, his sleeves\r\nrolled up, vest open, hat in his hand, evidently very hot and tired.\r\nWhen he saw me coming he sat down on a boulder to wipe the perspiration\r\nfrom his brow and neck, and taking me for one of the valley guides, he\r\ninquired the way to the fall ladders. I pointed out the path marked with\r\nlittle piles of stones, on seeing which he called his companion, saying\r\nthat the way was found; but he did not yet recognize me. Then I stood\r\ndirectly in front of him, looked him in the face, and held out my hand.\r\nHe thought I was offering to assist him in rising. “Never mind,” he\r\nsaid. Then I said, “Professor Butler, don’t you know me?” “I think not,”\r\nhe replied; but catching my eye, sudden recognition followed, and\r\nastonishment that I should have found him just when he was lost in the\r\nbrush and did not know that I was within hundreds of miles of him. “John\r\nMuir, John Muir, where have you come from?” Then I told him the story of\r\nmy feeling his presence when he entered the valley last evening, when he\r\nwas four or five miles distant, as I sat sketching on the North Dome.\r\nThis, of course, only made him wonder the more. Below the foot of the\r\nVernal Fall the guide was waiting with his saddle-horse, and I walked\r\nalong the trail, chatting all the way back to the hotel, talking of\r\nschool days, friends in Madison, of the students, how each had\r\nprospered, etc., ever and anon gazing at the stupendous rocks about us,\r\nnow growing indistinct in the gloaming, and again quoting from the\r\npoets—a rare ramble.\r\n\r\nIt was late ere we reached the hotel, and General Alvord was waiting the\r\nProfessor’s arrival for dinner. When I was introduced he seemed yet more\r\nastonished than the Professor at my descent from cloudland and going\r\nstraight to my friend without knowing in any ordinary way that he was\r\neven in California. They had come on direct from the East, had not yet\r\nvisited any of their friends in the state, and considered themselves\r\nundiscoverable. As we sat at dinner, the General leaned back in his\r\nchair, and looking down the table, thus introduced me to the dozen\r\nguests or so, including the staring fisherman mentioned above: “This\r\nman, you know, came down out of these huge, trackless mountains, you\r\nknow, to find his friend Professor Butler here, the very day he arrived;\r\nand how did he know he was here? He just felt him, he says. This is the\r\nqueerest case of Scotch farsightedness I ever heard of,” etc., etc.\r\nWhile my friend quoted Shakespeare: “More things in heaven and earth,\r\nHoratio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” “As the sun, ere he\r\nhas risen, sometimes paints his image in the firmament, e’en so the\r\nshadows of events precede the events, and in to-day already walks\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation, after dinner, over Madison days. The Professor\r\nwants me to promise to go with him, sometime, on a camping trip in the\r\nHawaiian Islands, while I tried to get him to go back with me to camp in\r\nthe high Sierra. But he says, “Not now.” He must not leave the General;\r\nand I was surprised to learn they are to leave the valley to-morrow or\r\nnext day. I’m glad I’m not great enough to be missed in the busy world.\r\n\r\n_August 4._ It seemed strange to sleep in a paltry hotel chamber after\r\nthe spacious magnificence and luxury of the starry sky and silver fir\r\ngrove. Bade farewell to my friend and the General. The old soldier was\r\nvery kind, and an interesting talker. He told me long stories of the\r\nFlorida Seminole war, in which he took part, and invited me to visit him\r\nin Omaha. Calling Carlo, I scrambled home through the Indian Cañon gate,\r\nrejoicing, pitying the poor Professor and General, bound by clocks,\r\nalmanacs, orders, duties, etc., and compelled to dwell with lowland care\r\nand dust and din, where Nature is covered and her voice smothered, while\r\nthe poor, insignificant wanderer enjoys the freedom and glory of God’s\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nApart from the human interest of my visit to-day, I greatly enjoyed\r\nYosemite, which I had visited only once before, having spent eight days\r\nlast spring in rambling amid its rocks and waters. Wherever we go in the\r\nmountains, or indeed in any of God’s wild fields, we find more than we\r\nseek. Descending four thousand feet in a few hours, we enter a new\r\nworld—climate, plants, sounds, inhabitants, and scenery all new or\r\nchanged. Near camp the goldcup oak forms sheets of chaparral, on top of\r\nwhich we may make our beds. Going down the Indian Cañon we observe this\r\nlittle bush changing by regular gradations to a large bush, to a small\r\ntree, and then larger, until on the rocky taluses near the bottom of the\r\nvalley we find it developed into a broad, wide-spreading, gnarled,\r\npicturesque tree from four to eight feet in diameter, and forty or fifty\r\nfeet high. Innumerable are the forms of water displayed. Every gliding\r\nreach, cascade, and fall has characters of its own. Had a good view of\r\nthe Vernal and Nevada, two of the main falls of the valley, less than a\r\nmile apart, and offering striking differences in voice, form, color,\r\netc. The Vernal, four hundred feet high and about seventy-five or\r\neighty feet wide, drops smoothly over a round-lipped precipice and forms\r\na superb apron of embroidery, green and white, slightly folded and\r\nfluted, maintaining this form nearly to the bottom, where it is suddenly\r\nveiled in quick-flying billows of spray and mist, in which the afternoon\r\nsunbeams play with ravishing beauty of rainbow colors. The Nevada is\r\nwhite from its first appearance as it leaps out into the freedom of the\r\nair. At the head it presents a twisted appearance, by an overfolding of\r\nthe current from striking on the side of its channel just before the\r\nfirst free out-bounding leap is made. About two thirds of the way down,\r\nthe hurrying throng of comet-shaped masses glance on an inclined part of\r\nthe face of the precipice and are beaten into yet whiter foam, greatly\r\nexpanded, and sent bounding outward, making an indescribably glorious\r\nshow, especially when the afternoon sunshine is pouring into it. In this\r\nfall—one of the most wonderful in the world—the water does not seem to\r\nbe under the dominion of ordinary laws, but rather as if it were a\r\nliving creature, full of the strength of the mountains and their huge,\r\nwild joy.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath heavy throbbing blasts of spray the broken river is seen\r\nemerging in ragged boulder-chafed strips. These are speedily gathered\r\ninto a roaring torrent, showing that the young river is still gloriously\r\nalive. On it goes, shouting, roaring, exulting in its strength, passes\r\nthrough a gorge with sublime display of energy, then suddenly expands on\r\na gently inclined pavement, down which it rushes in thin sheets and\r\nfolds of lace-work into a quiet pool,—”Emerald Pool,” as it is\r\ncalled,—a stopping-place, a period separating two grand sentences.\r\nResting here long enough to part with its foam-bells and gray mixtures\r\nof air, it glides quietly to the verge of the Vernal precipice in a\r\nbroad sheet and makes its new display in the Vernal Fall; then more\r\nrapids and rock tossings down the cañon, shaded by live oak, Douglas\r\nspruce, fir, maple, and dogwood. It receives the Illilouette tributary,\r\nand makes a long sweep out into the level, sun-filled valley to join the\r\nother streams which, like itself, have danced and sung their way down\r\nfrom snowy heights to form the main Merced—the river of Mercy. But of\r\nthis there is no end, and life, when one thinks of it, is so short.\r\nNever mind, one day in the midst of these divine glories is well worth\r\nliving and toiling and starving for.\r\n\r\nBefore parting with Professor Butler he gave me a book, and I gave him\r\none of my pencil sketches for his little son Henry, who is a favorite\r\nof mine. He used to make many visits to my room when I was a student.\r\nNever shall I forget his patriotic speeches for the Union, mounted on a\r\ntall stool, when he was only six years old.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that visitors to Yosemite should be so little\r\ninfluenced by its novel grandeur, as if their eyes were bandaged and\r\ntheir ears stopped. Most of those I saw yesterday were looking down as\r\nif wholly unconscious of anything going on about them, while the sublime\r\nrocks were trembling with the tones of the mighty chanting congregation\r\nof waters gathered from all the mountains round about, making music that\r\nmight draw angels out of heaven. Yet respectable-looking, even\r\nwise-looking people were fixing bits of worms on bent pieces of wire to\r\ncatch trout. Sport they called it. Should church-goers try to pass the\r\ntime fishing in baptismal fonts while dull sermons were being preached,\r\nthe so-called sport might not be so bad; but to play in the Yosemite\r\ntemple, seeking pleasure in the pain of fishes struggling for their\r\nlives, while God himself is preaching his sublimest water and stone\r\nsermons!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Happy Isles, Yosemite National Park_]\r\n\r\nNow I’m back at the camp-fire, and cannot help thinking about my\r\nrecognition of my friend’s presence in the valley while he was four or\r\nfive miles away, and while I had no means of knowing that he was\r\nnot thousands of miles away. It seems supernatural, but only because it\r\nis not understood. Anyhow, it seems silly to make so much of it, while\r\nthe natural and common is more truly marvelous and mysterious than the\r\nso-called supernatural. Indeed most of the miracles we hear of are\r\ninfinitely less wonderful than the commonest of natural phenomena, when\r\nfairly seen. Perhaps the invisible rays that struck me while I sat at\r\nwork on the Dome are something like those which attract and repel people\r\nat first sight, concerning which so much nonsense has been written. The\r\nworst apparent effect of these mysterious odd things is blindness to all\r\nthat is divinely common. Hawthorne, I fancy, could weave one of his\r\nweird romances out of this little telepathic episode, the one strange\r\nmarvel of my life, probably replacing my good old Professor by an\r\nattractive woman.\r\n\r\n_August 5._ We were awakened this morning before daybreak by the furious\r\nbarking of Carlo and Jack and the sound of stampeding sheep. Billy fled\r\nfrom his punk bed to the fire, and refused to stir into the darkness to\r\ntry to gather the scattered flock, or ascertain the nature of the\r\ndisturbance. It was a bear attack, as we afterward learned, and I\r\nsuppose little was gained by attempting to do anything before daylight.\r\nNevertheless, being anxious to know what was up, Carlo and I groped our\r\nway through the woods, guided by the rustling sound made by fragments of\r\nthe flock, not fearing the bear, for I knew that the runaways would go\r\nfrom their enemy as far as possible and Carlo’s nose was also to be\r\ndepended upon. About half a mile east of the corral we overtook twenty\r\nor thirty of the flock and succeeded in driving them back; then turning\r\nto the westward, we traced another band of fugitives and got them back\r\nto the flock. After daybreak I discovered the remains of a sheep\r\ncarcass, still warm, showing that Bruin must have been enjoying his\r\nearly mutton breakfast while I was seeking the runaways. He had eaten\r\nabout half of it. Six dead sheep lay in the corral, evidently smothered\r\nby the crowding and piling up of the flock against the side of the\r\ncorral wall when the bear entered. Making a wide circuit of the camp,\r\nCarlo and I discovered a third band of fugitives and drove them back to\r\ncamp. We also discovered another dead sheep half eaten, showing there\r\nhad been two of the shaggy freebooters at this early breakfast. They\r\nwere easily traced. They had each caught a sheep, jumped over the corral\r\nfence with them, carrying them as a cat carries a mouse, laid them at\r\nthe foot of fir trees a hundred yards or so back from the corral, and\r\neaten their fill. After breakfast I set out to seek more of the lost,\r\nand found seventy-five at a considerable distance from camp. In the\r\nafternoon I succeeded, with Carlo’s help, in getting them back to the\r\nflock. I don’t know whether all are together again or not. I shall make\r\na big fire this evening and keep watch.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Billy why he made his bed against the corral in rotten\r\nwood, when so many better places offered, he replied that he “wished to\r\nbe as near the sheep as possible in case bears should attack them.” Now\r\nthat the bears have come, he has moved his bed to the far side of the\r\ncamp, and seems afraid that he may be mistaken for a sheep.\r\n\r\nThis has been mostly a sheep day, and of course studies have been\r\ninterrupted. Nevertheless, the walk through the gloom of the woods\r\nbefore the dawn was worth while, and I have learned something about\r\nthese noble bears. Their tracks are very telling, and so are their\r\nbreakfasts. Scarce a trace of clouds to-day, and of course our ordinary\r\nmidday thunder is wanting.\r\n\r\n_August 6._ Enjoyed the grand illumination of the camp grove, last\r\nnight, from the fire we made to frighten the bears—compensation for\r\nloss of sleep and sheep. The noble pillars of verdure, vividly aglow,\r\nseemed to shoot into the sky like the flames that lighted them.\r\nNevertheless, one of the bears paid us another visit, as if more\r\nattracted than repelled by the fire, climbed into the corral, killed a\r\nsheep and made off with it without being seen, while still another was\r\nlost by trampling and suffocation against the side of the corral. Now\r\nthat our mutton has been tasted, I suppose it will be difficult to put a\r\nstop to the ravages of these freebooters.\r\n\r\nThe Don arrived to-day from the lowlands with provisions and a letter.\r\nOn learning the losses he had sustained, he determined to move the flock\r\nat once to the Upper Tuolumne region, saying that the bears would be\r\nsure to visit the camp every night as long as we stayed, and that no\r\nfire or noise we might make would avail to frighten them. No clouds save\r\na few thin, lustrous touches on the eastern horizon. Thunder heard in\r\nthe distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MONO TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 7._ Early this morning bade good-bye to the bears and blessed\r\nsilver fir camp, and moved slowly eastward along the Mono Trail. At\r\nsundown camped for the night on one of the many small flowery meadows so\r\ngreatly enjoyed on my excursion to Lake Tenaya. The dusty, noisy flock\r\nseems outrageously foreign and out of place in these nature gardens,\r\nmore so than bears among sheep. The harm they do goes to the heart, but\r\nglorious hope lifts above all the dust and din and bids me look forward\r\nto a good time coming, when money enough will be earned to enable me to\r\ngo walking where I like in pure wildness, with what I can carry on my\r\nback, and when the bread-sack is empty, run down to the nearest point on\r\nthe bread-line for more. Nor will these run-downs be blanks, for,\r\nwhether up or down, every step and jump on these blessed mountains is\r\nfull of fine lessons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF TENAYA LAKE SHOWING CATHEDRAL PEAK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE TRIBUTARY FOUNTAINS OF THE TUOLUMNE CA—ON\r\nWATERS, ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOFFMAN RANGE]\r\n\r\n_August 8._ Camp at the west end of Lake Tenaya. Arriving early, I took\r\na walk on the glacier-polished pavements along the north shore, and\r\nclimbed the magnificent mountain rock at the east end of the lake, now\r\nshining in the late afternoon light. Almost every yard of its surface\r\nshows the scoring and polishing action of a great glacier that enveloped\r\nit and swept heavily over its summit, though it is about two thousand\r\nfeet high above the lake and ten thousand above sea-level. This\r\nmajestic, ancient ice-flood came from the eastward, as the scoring and\r\ncrushing of the surface shows. Even below the waters of the lake the\r\nrock in some places is still grooved and polished; the lapping of the\r\nwaves and their disintegrating action have not as yet obliterated even\r\nthe superficial marks of glaciation. In climbing the steepest polished\r\nplaces I had to take off shoes and stockings. A fine region this for\r\nstudy of glacial action in mountain-making. I found many charming\r\nplants: arctic daisies, phlox, white spiræa, bryanthus, and\r\nrock-ferns,—pellæa, cheilanthes, allosorus,—fringing weathered seams\r\nall the way up to the summit; and sturdy junipers, grand old gray and\r\nbrown monuments, stood bravely erect on fissured spots here and there,\r\ntelling storm and avalanche stories of hundreds of winters. The view of\r\nthe lake from the top is, I think, the best of all. There is another\r\nrock, more striking in form than this, standing isolated at the head\r\nof the lake, but it is not more than half as high. It is a knob or knot\r\nof burnished granite, perhaps about a thousand feet high, apparently as\r\nflawless and strong in structure as a wave-worn pebble, and probably\r\nowes its existence to the superior resistance it offered to the action\r\nof the overflowing ice-flood.\r\n\r\nMade sketch of the lake, and sauntered back to camp, my iron-shod shoes\r\nclanking on the pavements disturbing the chipmunks and birds. After dark\r\nwent out to the shore,—not a breath of air astir, the lake a perfect\r\nmirror reflecting the sky and mountains with their stars and trees and\r\nwonderful sculpture, all their grandeur refined and doubled,—a\r\nmarvelously impressive picture, that seemed to belong more to heaven\r\nthan earth.\r\n\r\n_August 9._ I went ahead of the flock, and crossed over the divide\r\nbetween the Merced and Tuolumne Basins. The gap between the east end of\r\nthe Hoffman spur and the mass of mountain rocks about Cathedral Peak,\r\nthough roughened by ridges and waving folds, seems to be one of the\r\nchannels of a broad ancient glacier that came from the mountains on the\r\nsummit of the range. In crossing this divide the ice-river made an\r\nascent of about five hundred feet from the Tuolumne meadows. This entire\r\nregion must have been overswept by ice.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the divide, and also from the big Tuolumne Meadows, the\r\nwonderful mountain called Cathedral Peak is in sight. From every point\r\nof view it shows marked individuality. It is a majestic temple of one\r\nstone, hewn from the living rock, and adorned with spires and pinnacles\r\nin regular cathedral style. The dwarf pines on the roof look like\r\nmosses. I hope some time to climb to it to say my prayers and hear the\r\nstone sermons.\r\n\r\nThe big Tuolumne Meadows are flowery lawns, lying along the south fork\r\nof the Tuolumne River at a height of about eighty-five hundred to nine\r\nthousand feet above the sea, partially separated by forests and bars of\r\nglaciated granite. Here the mountains seem to have been cleared away or\r\nset back, so that wide-open views may be had in every direction. The\r\nupper end of the series lies at the base of Mount Lyell, the lower below\r\nthe east end of the Hoffman Range, so the length must be about ten or\r\ntwelve miles. They vary in width from a quarter of a mile to perhaps\r\nthree quarters, and a good many branch meadows put out along the banks\r\nof the tributary streams. This is the most spacious and delightful high\r\npleasure-ground I have yet seen. The air is keen and bracing, yet warm\r\nduring the day; and though lying high in the sky, the surrounding\r\nmountains are so much higher, one feels protected as if in a grand\r\nhall. Mounts Dana and Gibbs, massive red mountains, perhaps thirteen\r\nthousand feet high or more, bound the view on the east, the Cathedral\r\nand Unicorn Peaks, with many nameless peaks, on the south, the Hoffman\r\nRange on the west, and a number of peaks unnamed, as far as I know, on\r\nthe north. One of these last is much like the Cathedral. The grass of\r\nthe meadows is mostly fine and silky, with exceedingly slender leaves,\r\nmaking a close sod, above which the panicles of minute purple flowers\r\nseem to float in airy, misty lightness, while the sod is enriched with\r\nat least three species of gentian and as many or more of orthocarpus,\r\npotentilla, ivesia, solidago, pentstemon, with their gay\r\ncolors,—purple, blue, yellow, and red,—all of which I may know better\r\nere long. A central camp will probably be made in this region, from\r\nwhich I hope to make long excursions into the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the return trip I met the flock about three miles east of Lake\r\nTenaya. Here we camped for the night near a small lake lying on top of\r\nthe divide in a clump of the two-leaved pine. We are now about nine\r\nthousand feet above the sea. Small lakes abound in all sorts of\r\nsituations,—on ridges, along mountain sides, and in piles of moraine\r\nboulders, most of them mere pools. Only in those cañons of the larger\r\nstreams at the foot of declivities, where the down thrust of the\r\nglaciers was heaviest, do we find lakes of considerable size and depth.\r\nHow grateful a task it would be to trace them all and study them! How\r\npure their waters are, clear as crystal in polished stone basins! None\r\nof them, so far as I have seen, have fishes, I suppose on account of\r\nfalls making them inaccessible. Yet one would think their eggs might get\r\ninto these lakes by some chance or other; on ducks’ feet, for example,\r\nor in their mouths, or in their crops, as some plant seeds are\r\ndistributed. Nature has so many ways of doing such things. How did the\r\nfrogs, found in all the bogs and pools and lakes, however high, manage\r\nto get up these mountains? Surely not by jumping. Such excursions\r\nthrough miles of dry brush and boulders would be very hard on frogs.\r\nPerhaps their stringy gelatinous spawn is occasionally entangled or\r\nglued on the feet of water birds. Anyhow, they are here and in hearty\r\nhealth and voice. I like their cheery tronk and crink. They take the\r\nplace of songbirds at a pinch.\r\n\r\n_August 10._ Another of those charming exhilarating days that make the\r\nblood dance and excite nerve currents that render one unweariable and\r\nwell-nigh immortal. Had another view of the broad ice-ploughed divide,\r\nand gazed again and again at the Sierra temple and the great red\r\nmountains east of the meadows.\r\n\r\nWe are camped near the Soda Springs on the north side of the river. A\r\nhard time we had getting the sheep across. They were driven into a\r\nhorseshoe bend and fairly crowded off the bank. They seemed willing to\r\nsuffer death rather than risk getting wet, though they swim well enough\r\nwhen they have to. Why sheep should be so unreasonably afraid of water,\r\nI don’t know, but they do fear it as soon as they are born and perhaps\r\nbefore. I once saw a lamb only a few hours old approach a shallow stream\r\nabout two feet wide and an inch deep, after it had walked only about a\r\nhundred yards on its life journey. All the flock to which it belonged\r\nhad crossed this inch-deep stream, and as the mother and her lamb were\r\nthe last to cross, I had a good opportunity to observe them. As soon as\r\nthe flock was out of the way, the anxious mother crossed over and called\r\nthe youngster. It walked cautiously to the brink, gazed at the water,\r\nbleated piteously, and refused to venture. The patient mother went back\r\nto it again and again to encourage it, but long without avail. Like the\r\npilgrim on Jordan’s stormy bank it feared to launch away. At length,\r\ngathering its trembling inexperienced legs for the mighty effort,\r\nthrowing up its head as if it knew all about drowning, and was anxious\r\nto keep its nose above water, it made the tremendous leap, and landed in\r\nthe middle of the inch-deep stream. It seemed astonished to find that,\r\ninstead of sinking over head and ears, only its toes were wet, gazed at\r\nthe shining water a few seconds, and then sprang to the shore safe and\r\ndry through the dreadful adventure. All kinds of wild sheep are mountain\r\nanimals, and their descendants’ dread of water is not easily accounted\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n_August 11._ Fine shining weather, with a ten minutes’ noon thunderstorm\r\nand rain. Rambling all day getting acquainted with the region north of\r\nthe river. Found a small lake and many charming glacier meadows\r\nembosomed in an extensive forest of the two-leaved pine. The forest is\r\ngrowing on broad, almost continuous deposits of moraine material, is\r\nremarkably even in its growth, and the trees are much closer together\r\nthan in any of the fir or pine woods farther down the range. The\r\nevenness of the growth would seem to indicate that the trees are all of\r\nthe same age or nearly so. This regularity has probably been in great\r\npart the result of fire. I saw several large patches and strips of dead\r\nbleached spars, the ground beneath them covered with a young even\r\ngrowth. Fire can run in these woods, not only because the thin bark of\r\nthe trees is dripping with resin, but because the growth is close, and\r\nthe comparatively rich soil produces good crops of tall broad-leaved\r\ngrasses on which fire can travel, even when the weather is calm. Besides\r\nthese fire-killed patches there are a good many fallen uprooted trees\r\nhere and there, some with the bark and needles still on, as if they had\r\nlately been blown down in some thunderstorm blast. Saw a large\r\nblack-tailed deer, a buck with antlers like the upturned roots of a\r\nfallen pine.\r\n\r\nAfter a long ramble through the dense encumbered woods I emerged upon a\r\nsmooth meadow full of sunshine like a lake of light, about a mile and a\r\nhalf long, a quarter to half a mile wide, and bounded by tall arrowy\r\npines. The sod, like that of all the glacier meadows hereabouts, is made\r\nof silky agrostis and calamagrostis chiefly; their panicles of purple\r\nflowers and purple stems, exceedingly light and airy, seem to float\r\nabove the green plush of leaves like a thin misty cloud, while the sod\r\nis brightened by several species of gentian, potentilla, ivesia,\r\northocarpus, and their corresponding bees and butterflies. All the\r\nglacier meadows are beautiful, but few are so perfect as this one.\r\nCompared with it the most carefully leveled, licked, snipped artificial\r\nlawns of pleasure-grounds are coarse things. I should like to live here\r\nalways. It is so calm and withdrawn while open to the universe in full\r\ncommunion with everything good. To the north of this glorious meadow I\r\ndiscovered the camp of some Indian hunters. Their fire was still\r\nburning, but they had not yet returned from the chase.\r\n\r\nFrom meadow to meadow, every one beautiful beyond telling, and from lake\r\nto lake through groves and belts of arrowy trees, I held my way\r\nnorthward toward Mount Conness, finding telling beauty everywhere, while\r\nthe encompassing mountains were calling “Come.” Hope I may climb them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_August 12._ The sky-scenery has changed but little so far with the\r\nchange in elevation. Clouds about .05. Glorious pearly cumuli tinted\r\nwith purple of ineffable fineness of tone. Moved camp to the side of the\r\nglacier meadow mentioned above. To let sheep trample so divinely fine a\r\nplace seems barbarous. Fortunately they prefer the succulent\r\nbroad-leaved triticum and other woodland grasses to the silky species of\r\nthe meadows, and therefore seldom bite them or set foot on them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLACIER MEADOW, ON THE HEADWATERS OF THE TUOLUMNE 9500\r\nFEET ABOVE THE SEA]\r\n\r\nThe shepherd and the Don cannot agree about methods of herding. Billy\r\nsets his dog Jack on the sheep far too often, so the Don thinks; and\r\nafter some dispute to-day, in which the shepherd loudly claimed the\r\nright to dog the sheep as often as he pleased, he started for the\r\nplains. Now I suppose the care of the sheep will fall on me, though Mr.\r\nDelaney promises to do the herding himself for a while, then return to\r\nthe lowlands and bring another shepherd, so as to leave me free to rove\r\nas I like.\r\n\r\nHad another rich ramble. Pushed northward beyond the forests to the head\r\nof the general basin, where traces of glacial action are strikingly\r\nclear and interesting. The recesses among the peaks look like quarries,\r\nso raw and fresh are the moraine chips and boulders that strew the\r\nground in Nature’s glacial workshops.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return to camp we received a visit from an Indian,\r\nprobably one of the hunters whose camp I had discovered. He came from\r\nMono, he said, with others of his tribe, to hunt deer. One that he had\r\nkilled a short distance from here he was carrying on his back, its legs\r\ntied together in an ornamental bunch on his forehead. Throwing down his\r\nburden, he gazed stolidly for a few minutes in silent Indian fashion,\r\nthen cut off eight or ten pounds of venison for us, and begged a “lill”\r\n(little) of everything he saw or could think of—flour, bread, sugar,\r\ntobacco, whiskey, needles, etc. We gave a fair price for the meat in\r\nflour and sugar and added a few needles. A strangely dirty and irregular\r\nlife these dark-eyed, dark-haired, half-happy savages lead in this clean\r\nwilderness,—starvation and abundance, deathlike calm, indolence, and\r\nadmirable, indefatigable action succeeding each other in stormy rhythm\r\nlike winter and summer. Two things they have that civilized toilers\r\nmight well envy them—pure air and pure water. These go far to cover and\r\ncure the grossness of their lives. Their food is mostly good berries,\r\npine nuts, clover, lily bulbs, wild sheep, antelope, deer, grouse, sage\r\nhens, and the larvæ of ants, wasps, bees, and other insects.\r\n\r\n_August 13._ Day all sunshine, dawn and evening purple, noon gold, no\r\nclouds, air motionless. Mr. Delaney arrived with two shepherds, one of\r\nthem an Indian. On his way up from the plains he left some provisions at\r\nthe Portuguese camp on Porcupine Creek near our old Yosemite camp, and I\r\nset out this morning with one of the pack animals to fetch them. Arrived\r\nat the Porcupine camp at noon, and might have returned to the Tuolumne\r\nlate in the evening, but concluded to stay over night with the\r\nPortuguese shepherds at their pressing invitation. They had sad stories\r\nto tell of losses from the Yosemite bears, and were so discouraged they\r\nseemed on the point of leaving the mountains; for the bears came every\r\nnight and helped themselves to one or several of the flock in spite of\r\nall their efforts to keep them off.\r\n\r\nI spent the afternoon in a grand ramble along the Yosemite walls. From\r\nthe highest of the rocks called the Three Brothers, I enjoyed a\r\nmagnificent view comprehending all the upper half of the floor of the\r\nvalley and nearly all the rocks of the walls on both sides and at the\r\nhead, with snowy peaks in the background. Saw also the Vernal and Nevada\r\nFalls, a truly glorious picture,—rocky strength and permanence combined\r\nwith beauty of plants frail and fine and evanescent; water descending in\r\nthunder, and the same water gliding through meadows and groves in\r\ngentlest beauty. This standpoint is about eight thousand feet above the\r\nsea, or four thousand feet above the floor of the valley, and every\r\ntree, though looking small and feathery, stands in admirable clearness,\r\nand the shadows they cast are as distinct in outline as if seen at a\r\ndistance of a few yards. They appeared even more so. No words will ever\r\ndescribe the exquisite beauty and charm of this mountain park—Nature’s\r\nlandscape garden at once tenderly beautiful and sublime. No wonder it\r\ndraws nature-lovers from all over the world.\r\n\r\nGlacial action even on this lofty summit is plainly displayed. Not only\r\nhas all the lovely valley now smiling in sunshine been filled to the\r\nbrim with ice, but it has been deeply overflowed.\r\n\r\nI visited our old Yosemite camp-ground on the head of Indian Creek, and\r\nfound it fairly patted and smoothed down with bear-tracks. The bears had\r\neaten all the sheep that were smothered in the corral, and some of the\r\ngrand animals must have died, for Mr. Delaney, before leaving camp, put\r\na large quantity of poison in the carcasses. All sheep-men carry\r\nstrychnine to kill coyotes, bears, and panthers, though neither coyotes\r\nnor panthers are at all numerous in the upper mountains. The little\r\ndog-like wolves are far more numerous in the foothill region and on the\r\nplains, where they find a better supply of food,—saw only one\r\npanther-track above eight thousand feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Three Brothers, Yosemite National Park_]\r\n\r\nOn my return after sunset to the Portuguese camp I found the shepherds\r\ngreatly excited over the behavior of the bears that have learned to like\r\nmutton. “They are getting worse and worse,” they lamented. Not\r\nwilling to wait decently until after dark for their suppers, they come\r\nand kill and eat their fill in broad daylight. The evening before my\r\narrival, when the two shepherds were leisurely driving the flock toward\r\ncamp half an hour before sunset, a hungry bear came out of the chaparral\r\nwithin a few yards of them and shuffled deliberately toward the flock.\r\n“Portuguese Joe,” who always carried a gun loaded with buckshot, fired\r\nexcitedly, threw down his gun, fled to the nearest suitable tree, and\r\nclimbed to a safe height without waiting to see the effect of his shot.\r\nHis companion also ran, but said that he saw the bear rise on its hind\r\nlegs and throw out its arms as if feeling for somebody, and then go into\r\nthe brush as if wounded.\r\n\r\nAt another of their camps in this neighborhood, a bear with two cubs\r\nattacked the flock before sunset, just as they were approaching the\r\ncorral. Joe promptly climbed a tree out of danger, while Antone,\r\nrebuking his companion for cowardice in abandoning his charge, said that\r\nhe was not going to let bears “eat up his sheeps” in daylight, and\r\nrushed towards the bears, shouting and setting his dog on them. The\r\nfrightened cubs climbed a tree, but the mother ran to meet the shepherd\r\nand seemed anxious to fight. Antone stood astonished for a moment,\r\neyeing the oncoming bear, then turned and fled, closely pursued. Unable\r\nto reach a suitable tree for climbing, he ran to the camp and scrambled\r\nup to the roof of the little cabin; the bear followed, but did not climb\r\nto the roof,—only stood glaring up at him for a few minutes,\r\nthreatening him and holding him in mortal terror, then went to her cubs,\r\ncalled them down, went to the flock, caught a sheep for supper, and\r\nvanished in the brush. As soon as the bear left the cabin, the trembling\r\nAntone begged Joe to show him a good safe tree, up which he climbed like\r\na sailor climbing a mast, and remained as long as he could hold on, the\r\ntree being almost branchless. After these disastrous experiences the two\r\nshepherds chopped and gathered large piles of dry wood and made a ring\r\nof fire around the corral every night, while one with a gun kept watch\r\nfrom a comfortable stage built on a neighboring pine that commanded a\r\nview of the corral. This evening the show made by the circle of fire was\r\nvery fine, bringing out the surrounding trees in most impressive relief,\r\nand making the thousands of sheep eyes glow like a glorious bed of\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\n_August 14._ Up to the time I went to bed last night all was quiet,\r\nthough we expected the shaggy freebooters every minute. They did not\r\ncome till near midnight, when a pair walked boldly to the corral between\r\ntwo of the great fires, climbed in, killed two sheep and smothered ten,\r\nwhile the frightened watcher in the tree did not fire a single shot,\r\nsaying that he was afraid he might kill some of the sheep, for the bears\r\ngot into the corral before he got a good clear view of them. I told the\r\nshepherds they should at once move the flock to another camp. “Oh, no\r\nuse, no use,” they lamented; “where we go, the bears go too. See my poor\r\ndead sheeps—soon all dead. No use try another camp. We go down to the\r\nplains.” And as I afterwards learned, they were driven out of the\r\nmountains a month before the usual time. Were bears much more numerous\r\nand destructive, the sheep would be kept away altogether.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that bears, so fond of all sorts of flesh, running the\r\nrisks of guns and fires and poison, should never attack men except in\r\ndefense of their young. How easily and safely a bear could pick us up as\r\nwe lie asleep! Only wolves and tigers seem to have learned to hunt man\r\nfor food, and perhaps sharks and crocodiles. Mosquitoes and other\r\ninsects would, I suppose, devour a helpless man in some parts of the\r\nworld, and so might lions, leopards, wolves, hyenas, and panthers at\r\ntimes if pressed by hunger,—but under ordinary circumstances, perhaps,\r\nonly the tiger among land animals may be said to be a man-eater,—unless\r\nwe add man himself.\r\n\r\nClouds as usual about .05. Another glorious Sierra day, warm, crisp,\r\nfragrant, and clear. Many of the flowering plants have gone to seed, but\r\nmany others are unfolding their petals every day, and the firs and pines\r\nare more fragrant than ever. Their seeds are nearly ripe, and will soon\r\nbe flying in the merriest flocks that ever spread a wing.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to our Tuolumne camp, I enjoyed the scenery if possible\r\nmore than when it first came to view. Every feature already seems\r\nfamiliar as if I had lived here always. I never weary gazing at the\r\nwonderful Cathedral. It has more individual character than any other\r\nrock or mountain I ever saw, excepting perhaps the Yosemite South Dome.\r\nThe forests, too, seem kindly familiar, and the lakes and meadows and\r\nglad singing streams. I should like to dwell with them forever. Here\r\nwith bread and water I should be content. Even if not allowed to roam\r\nand climb, tethered to a stake or tree in some meadow or grove, even\r\nthen I should be content forever. Bathed in such beauty, watching, the\r\nexpressions ever varying on the faces of the mountains, watching the\r\nstars, which here have a glory that the lowlander never dreams of,\r\nwatching the circling seasons, listening to the songs of the waters and\r\nwinds and birds, would be endless pleasure. And what glorious cloudlands\r\nI should see, storms and calms,—a new heaven and a new earth every day,\r\naye and new inhabitants. And how many visitors I should have. I feel\r\nsure I should not have one dull moment. And why should this appear\r\nextravagant? It is only common sense, a sign of health, genuine,\r\nnatural, all-awake health. One would be at an endless Godful play, and\r\nwhat speeches and music and acting and scenery and lights!—sun, moon,\r\nstars, auroras. Creation just beginning, the morning stars “still\r\nsinging together and all the sons of God shouting for joy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBLOODY CA—ON AND MONO LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 21._ Have just returned from a fine wild excursion across the\r\nrange to Mono Lake, by way of the Mono or Bloody Cañon Pass. Mr. Delaney\r\nhas been good to me all summer, lending a helping, sympathizing hand at\r\nevery opportunity, as if my wild notions and rambles and studies were\r\nhis own. He is one of those remarkable California men who have been\r\noverflowed and denuded and remodeled by the excitements of the gold\r\nfields, like the Sierra landscapes by grinding ice, bringing the harder\r\nbosses and ridges of character into relief,—a tall, lean, big-boned,\r\nbig-hearted Irishman, educated for a priest in Maynooth College,—lots\r\nof good in him, shining out now and then in this mountain light.\r\nRecognizing my love of wild places, he told me one evening that I ought\r\nto go through Bloody Cañon, for he was sure I should find it wild\r\nenough. He had not been there himself, he said, but had heard many of\r\nhis mining friends speak of it as the wildest of all the Sierra passes.\r\nOf course I was glad to go. It lies just to the east of our camp and\r\nswoops down from the summit of the range to the edge of the Mono Desert,\r\nmaking a descent of about four thousand feet in a distance of about four\r\nmiles. It was known and traveled as a pass by wild animals and the\r\nIndians long before its discovery by white men in the gold year of 1858,\r\nas is shown by old trails which come together at the head of it. The\r\nname may have been suggested by the red color of the metamorphic slates\r\nin which the cañon abounds, or by the blood stains on the rocks from the\r\nunfortunate animals that were compelled to slide and shuffle over the\r\nsharp-angled boulders.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I tied my notebook and some bread to my belt, and\r\nstrode away full of eager hope, feeling that I was going to have a\r\nglorious revel. The glacier meadows that lay along my way served to\r\nsoothe my morning speed, for the sod was full of blue gentians and\r\ndaisies, kalmia and dwarf vaccinium, calling for recognition as old\r\nfriends, and I had to stop many times to examine the shining rocks over\r\nwhich the ancient glacier had passed with tremendous pressure, polishing\r\nthem so well that they reflected the sunlight like glass in some places,\r\nwhile fine striæ, seen clearly through a lens, indicated the direction\r\nin which the ice had flowed. On some of the sloping polished pavements\r\nabrupt steps occur, showing that occasionally large masses of the rock\r\nhad given way before the glacial pressure, as well as small particles;\r\nmoraines, too, some scattered, others regular like long curving\r\nembankments and dams, occur here and there, giving the general surface\r\nof the region a young, new-made appearance. I watched the gradual\r\ndwarfing of the pines as I ascended, and the corresponding dwarfing of\r\nnearly all the rest of the vegetation. On the slopes of Mammoth\r\nMountain, to the south of the pass, I saw many gaps in the woods\r\nreaching from the upper edge of the timber-line down to the level\r\nmeadows, where avalanches of snow had descended, sweeping away every\r\ntree in their paths as well as the soil they were growing in, leaving\r\nthe bedrock bare. The trees are nearly all uprooted, but a few that had\r\nbeen extremely well anchored in clefts of the rock were broken off near\r\nthe ground. It seems strange at first sight that trees that had been\r\nallowed to grow for a century or more undisturbed should in their old\r\nage be thus swished away at a stroke. Such avalanches can only occur\r\nunder rare conditions of weather and snowfall. No doubt on some\r\npositions of the mountain slopes the inclination and smoothness of the\r\nsurface is such that avalanches must occur every winter, or even after\r\nevery heavy snowstorm, and of course no trees or even bushes can grow in\r\ntheir channels. I noticed a few clean-swept slopes of this kind. The\r\nuprooted trees that had grown in the pathway of what might be called\r\n“century avalanches” were piled in windrows, and tucked snugly against\r\nthe wall-trees of the gaps, heads downward, excepting a few that were\r\ncarried out into the open ground of the meadows, where the heads of the\r\navalanches had stopped. Young pines, mostly the two-leaved and the\r\nwhite-barked, are already springing up in these cleared gaps. It would\r\nbe interesting to ascertain the age of these saplings, for thus we\r\nshould gain a fair approximation to the year that the great avalanches\r\noccurred. Perhaps most or all of them occurred the same winter. How glad\r\nI should be if free to pursue such studies!\r\n\r\nNear the summit at the head of the pass I found a species of dwarf\r\nwillow lying perfectly flat on the ground, making a nice, soft, silky\r\ngray carpet, not a single stem or branch more than three inches high;\r\nbut the catkins, which are now nearly ripe, stand erect and make a\r\nclose, nearly regular gray growth, being larger than all the rest of the\r\nplants. Some of these interesting dwarfs have only one catkin—willow\r\nbushes reduced to their lowest terms. I found patches of dwarf vaccinium\r\nalso forming smooth carpets, closely pressed to the ground or against\r\nthe sides of stones, and covered with round pink flowers in lavish\r\nabundance as if they had fallen from the sky like hail. A little higher,\r\nalmost at the very head of the pass, I found the blue arctic daisy and\r\npurple-flowered bryanthus, the mountain’s own darlings, gentle\r\nmountaineers face to face with the sky, kept safe and warm by a thousand\r\nmiracles, seeming always the finer and purer the wilder and stormier\r\ntheir homes. The trees, tough and resiny, seem unable to go a step\r\nfarther; but up and up, far above the tree-line, these tender plants\r\nclimb, cheerily spreading their gray and pink carpets right up to the\r\nvery edges of the snow-banks in deep hollows and shadows. Here, too, is\r\nthe familiar robin, tripping on the flowery lawns, bravely singing the\r\nsame cheery song I first heard when a boy in Wisconsin newly arrived\r\nfrom old Scotland. In this fine company sauntering enchanted, taking no\r\nheed of time, I at length entered the gate of the pass, and the huge\r\nrocks began to close around me in all their mysterious impressiveness.\r\nJust then I was startled by a lot of queer, hairy, muffled creatures\r\ncoming shuffling, shambling, wallowing toward me as if they had no\r\nbones in their bodies. Had I discovered them while they were yet a good\r\nway off, I should have tried to avoid them. What a picture they made\r\ncontrasted with the others I had just been admiring. When I came up to\r\nthem, I found that they were only a band of Indians from Mono on their\r\nway to Yosemite for a load of acorns. They were wrapped in blankets made\r\nof the skins of sage-rabbits. The dirt on some of the faces seemed\r\nalmost old enough and thick enough to have a geological significance;\r\nsome were strangely blurred and divided into sections by seams and\r\nwrinkles that looked like cleavage joints, and had a worn abraded look\r\nas if they had lain exposed to the weather for ages. I tried to pass\r\nthem without stopping, but they wouldn’t let me; forming a dismal circle\r\nabout me, I was closely besieged while they begged whiskey or tobacco,\r\nand it was hard to convince them that I hadn’t any. How glad I was to\r\nget away from the gray, grim crowd and see them vanish down the trail!\r\nYet it seems sad to feel such desperate repulsion from one’s fellow\r\nbeings, however degraded. To prefer the society of squirrels and\r\nwoodchucks to that of our own species must surely be unnatural. So with\r\na fresh breeze and a hill or mountain between us I must wish them\r\nGodspeed and try to pray and sing with Burns, “It’s coming yet, for a’\r\nthat, that man to man, the warld o’er, shall brothers be for a’ that.”\r\n\r\nHow the day passed I hardly know. By the map I have come only about ten\r\nor twelve miles, though the sun is already low in the west, showing how\r\nlong I must have lingered, observing, sketching, taking notes among the\r\nglaciated rocks and moraines and Alpine flower-beds.\r\n\r\nAt sundown the somber crags and peaks were inspired with the ineffable\r\nbeauty of the alpenglow, and a solemn, awful stillness hushed everything\r\nin the landscape. Then I crept into a hollow by the side of a small lake\r\nnear the head of the cañon, smoothed a sheltered spot, and gathered a\r\nfew pine tassels for a bed. After the short twilight began to fade I\r\nkindled a sunny fire, made a tin cupful of tea, and lay down to watch\r\nthe stars. Soon the night-wind began to flow from the snowy peaks\r\noverhead, at first only a gentle breathing, then gaining strength, in\r\nless than an hour rumbled in massive volume something like a boisterous\r\nstream in a boulder-choked channel, roaring and moaning down the cañon\r\nas if the work it had to do was tremendously important and fateful; and\r\nmingled with these storm tones were those of the waterfalls on the\r\nnorth side of the cañon, now sounding distinctly, now smothered by the\r\nheavier cataracts of air, making a glorious psalm of savage wildness. My\r\nfire squirmed and struggled as if ill at ease, for though in a sheltered\r\nnook, detached masses of icy wind often fell like icebergs on top of it,\r\nscattering sparks and coals, so that I had to keep well back to avoid\r\nbeing burned. But the big resiny roots and knots of the dwarf pine could\r\nneither be beaten out nor blown away, and the flames, now rushing up in\r\nlong lances, now flattened and twisted on the rocky ground, roared as if\r\ntrying to tell the storm stories of the trees they belonged to, as the\r\nlight given out was telling the story of the sunshine they had gathered\r\nin centuries of summers.\r\n\r\nThe stars shone clear in the strip of sky between the huge dark cliffs;\r\nand as I lay recalling the lessons of the day, suddenly the full moon\r\nlooked down over the cañon wall, her face apparently filled with eager\r\nconcern, which had a startling effect, as if she had left her place in\r\nthe sky and had come down to gaze on me alone, like a person entering\r\none’s bedroom. It was hard to realize that she was in her place in the\r\nsky, and was looking abroad on half the globe, land and sea, mountains,\r\nplains, lakes, rivers, oceans, ships, cities with their myriads of\r\ninhabitants sleeping and waking, sick and well. No, she seemed to be\r\njust on the rim of Bloody Cañon and looking only at me. This was indeed\r\ngetting near to Nature. I remember watching the harvest moon rising\r\nabove the oak trees in Wisconsin apparently as big as a cart-wheel and\r\nnot farther than half a mile distant. With these exceptions I might say\r\nI never before had seen the moon, and this night she seemed so full of\r\nlife and so near, the effect was marvelously impressive and made me\r\nforget the Indians, the great black rocks above me, and the wild uproar\r\nof the winds and waters making their way down the huge jagged gorge. Of\r\ncourse I slept but little and gladly welcomed the dawn over the Mono\r\nDesert. By the time I had made a cupful of tea the sunbeams were pouring\r\nthrough the cañon, and I set forth, gazing eagerly at the tremendous\r\nwalls of red slates savagely hacked and scarred and apparently ready to\r\nfall in avalanches great enough to choke the pass and fill up the chain\r\nof lakelets. But soon its beauties came to view, and I bounded lightly\r\nfrom rock to rock, admiring the polished bosses shining in the slant\r\nsunshine with glorious effect in the general roughness of moraines and\r\navalanche taluses, even toward the head of the cañon near the highest\r\nfountains of the ice. Here, too, are most of the lowly plant people seen\r\nyesterday on the other side of the divide now opening their beautiful\r\neyes. None could fail to glory in Nature’s tender care for them in so\r\nwild a place. The little ouzel is flitting from rock to rock along the\r\nrapid swirling Cañon Creek, diving for breakfast in icy pools, and\r\nmerrily singing as if the huge rugged avalanche-swept gorge was the most\r\ndelightful of all its mountain homes. Besides a high fall on the north\r\nwall of the cañon, apparently coming direct from the sky, there are many\r\nnarrow cascades, bright silvery ribbons zigzagging down the red cliffs,\r\ntracing the diagonal cleavage joints of the metamorphic slates, now\r\ncontracted and out of sight, now leaping from ledge to ledge in filmy\r\nsheets through which the sunbeams sift. And on the main Cañon Creek, to\r\nwhich all these are tributary, is a series of small falls, cascades, and\r\nrapids extending all the way down to the foot of the cañon, interrupted\r\nonly by the lakes in which the tossed and beaten waters rest. One of the\r\nfinest of the cascades is outspread on the face of a precipice, its\r\nwaters separated into ribbon-like strips, and woven into a diamond-like\r\npattern by tracing the cleavage joints of the rock, while tufts of\r\nbryanthus, grass, sedge, saxifrage form beautiful fringes. Who could\r\nimagine beauty so fine in so savage a place? Gardens are blooming in all\r\nsorts of nooks and hollows,—at the head alpine eriogonums, erigerons,\r\nsaxifrages, gentians, cowania, bush primula; in the middle region\r\nlarkspur, columbine, orthocarpus, castilleia, harebell, epilobium,\r\nviolets, mints, yarrow; near the foot sunflowers, lilies, brier rose,\r\niris, lonicera, clematis.\r\n\r\nOne of the smallest of the cascades, which I name the Bower Cascade, is\r\nin the lower region of the pass, where the vegetation is snowy and\r\nluxuriant. Wild rose and dogwood form dense masses overarching the\r\nstream, and out of this bower the creek, grown strong with many\r\nindashing tributaries, leaps forth into the light, and descends in a\r\nfluted curve thick-sown with crisp flashing spray. At the foot of the\r\ncañon there is a lake formed in part at least by the damming of the\r\nstream by a terminal moraine. The three other lakes in the cañon are in\r\nbasins eroded from the solid rock, where the pressure of the glacier was\r\ngreatest, and the most resisting portions of the basin rims are\r\nbeautifully, tellingly polished. Below Moraine Lake at the foot of the\r\ncañon there are several old lake-basins lying between the large lateral\r\nmoraines which extend out into the desert. These basins are now\r\ncompletely filled up by the material carried in by the streams, and\r\nchanged to dry sandy flats covered mostly by grass and artemisia and\r\nsun-loving flowers. All these lower lake-basins were evidently formed by\r\nterminal moraine dams deposited where the receding glacier had lingered\r\nduring short periods of less waste, or greater snowfall, or both.\r\n\r\nLooking up the cañon from the warm sunny edge of the Mono plain my\r\nmorning ramble seems a dream, so great is the change in the vegetation\r\nand climate. The lilies on the bank of Moraine Lake are higher than my\r\nhead, and the sunshine is hot enough for palms. Yet the snow round the\r\narctic gardens at the summit of the pass is plainly visible, only about\r\nfour miles away, and between lie specimen zones of all the principal\r\nclimates of the globe. In little more than an hour one may swoop down\r\nfrom winter to summer, from an Arctic to a torrid region, through as\r\ngreat changes of climate as one would encounter in traveling from\r\nLabrador to Florida.\r\n\r\nThe Indians I had met near the head of the cañon had camped at the foot\r\nof it the night before they made the ascent, and I found their fire\r\nstill smoking on the side of a small tributary stream near Moraine\r\nLake; and on the edge of what is called the Mono Desert, four or five\r\nmiles from the lake, I came to a patch of elymus, or wild rye, growing\r\nin magnificent waving clumps six or eight feet high, bearing heads six\r\nto eight inches long. The crop was ripe, and Indian women were gathering\r\nthe grain in baskets by bending down large handfuls, beating out the\r\nseed, and fanning it in the wind. The grains are about five eighths of\r\nan inch long, dark-colored and sweet. I fancy the bread made from it\r\nmust be as good as wheat bread. A fine squirrelish employment this wild\r\ngrain gathering seems, and the women were evidently enjoying it,\r\nlaughing and chattering and looking almost natural, though most Indians\r\nI have seen are not a whit more natural in their lives than we civilized\r\nwhites. Perhaps if I knew them better I should like them better. The\r\nworst thing about them is their uncleanliness. Nothing truly wild is\r\nunclean. Down on the shore of Mono Lake I saw a number of their flimsy\r\nhuts on the banks of streams that dash swiftly into that dead sea,—mere\r\nbrush tents where they lie and eat at their ease. Some of the men were\r\nfeasting on buffalo berries, lying beneath the tall bushes now red with\r\nfruit. The berries are rather insipid, but they must needs be wholesome,\r\nsince for days and weeks the Indians, it is said, eat nothing else. In\r\nthe season they in like manner depend chiefly on the fat larvæ of a fly\r\nthat breeds in the salt water of the lake, or on the big fat corrugated\r\ncaterpillars of a species of silkworm that feeds on the leaves of the\r\nyellow pine. Occasionally a grand rabbit-drive is organized and hundreds\r\nare slain with clubs on the lake shore, chased and frightened into a\r\ndense crowd by dogs, boys, girls, men and women, and rings of sage brush\r\nfire, when of course they are quickly killed. The skins are made into\r\nblankets. In the autumn the more enterprising of the hunters bring in a\r\ngood many deer, and rarely a wild sheep from the high peaks. Antelopes\r\nused to be abundant on the desert at the base of the interior\r\nmountain-ranges. Sage hens, grouse, and squirrels help to vary their\r\nwild diet of worms; pine nuts also from the small interesting _Pinus\r\nmonophylla_, and good bread and good mush are made from acorns and wild\r\nrye. Strange to say, they seem to like the lake larvæ best of all. Long\r\nwindrows are washed up on the shore, which they gather and dry like\r\ngrain for winter use. It is said that wars, on account of encroachments\r\non each other’s worm-grounds, are of common occurrence among the various\r\ntribes and families. Each claims a certain marked portion of the shore.\r\nThe pine nuts are delicious—large quantities are gathered every autumn.\r\nThe tribes of the west flank of the range trade acorns for worms and\r\npine nuts. The squaws carry immense loads on their backs across the\r\nrough passes and down the range, making journeys of about forty or fifty\r\nmiles each way.\r\n\r\nThe desert around the lake is surprisingly flowery. In many places among\r\nthe sage bushes I saw mentzelia, abronia, aster, bigelovia, and gilia,\r\nall of which seemed to enjoy the hot sunshine. The abronia, in\r\nparticular, is a delicate, fragrant, and most charming plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONO LAKE AND VOLCANIC CONES, LOOKING SOUTH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHEST MONO VOLCANIC CONES (NEAR VIEW)]\r\n\r\nOpposite the mouth of the cañon a range of volcanic cones extends\r\nsouthward from the lake, rising abruptly out of the desert like a chain\r\nof mountains. The largest of the cones are about twenty-five hundred\r\nfeet high above the lake level, have well-formed craters, and all of\r\nthem are evidently comparatively recent additions to the landscape. At a\r\ndistance of a few miles they look like heaps of loose ashes that have\r\nnever been blest by either rain or snow, but, for a’ that and a’ that,\r\nyellow pines are climbing their gray slopes, trying to clothe them and\r\ngive beauty for ashes. A country of wonderful contrasts. Hot deserts\r\nbounded by snow-laden mountains,—cinders and ashes scattered on\r\nglacier-polished pavements,—frost and fire working together in the\r\nmaking of beauty. In the lake are several volcanic islands, which show\r\nthat the waters were once mingled with fire.\r\n\r\nGlad to get back to the green side of the mountains, though I have\r\ngreatly enjoyed the gray east side and hope to see more of it. Reading\r\nthese grand mountain manuscripts displayed through every vicissitude of\r\nheat and cold, calm and storm, upheaving volcanoes and down-grinding\r\nglaciers, we see that everything in Nature called destruction must be\r\ncreation—a change from beauty to beauty.\r\n\r\nOur glacier meadow camp north of the Soda Springs seems more beautiful\r\nevery day. The grass covers all the ground though the leaves are\r\nthread-like in fineness, and in walking on the sod it seems like a plush\r\ncarpet of marvelous richness and softness, and the purple panicles\r\nbrushing against one’s feet are not felt. This is a typical glacier\r\nmeadow, occupying the basin of a vanished lake, very definitely bounded\r\nby walls of the arrowy two-leaved pines drawn up in a handsome orderly\r\narray like soldiers on parade. There are many other meadows of the same\r\nkind hereabouts imbedded in the woods. The main big meadows along the\r\nriver are the same in general and extend with but little interruption\r\nfor ten or twelve miles, but none I have seen are so finely finished\r\nand perfect as this one. It is richer in flowering plants than the\r\nprairies of Wisconsin and Illinois were when in all their wild glory.\r\nThe showy flowers are mostly three species of gentian, a purple and\r\nyellow orthocarpus, a golden-rod or two, a small blue pentstemon almost\r\nlike a gentian, potentilla, ivesia, pedicularis, white violet, kalmia,\r\nand bryanthus. There are no coarse weedy plants. Through this flowery\r\nlawn flows a stream silently gliding, swirling, slipping as if careful\r\nnot to make the slightest noise. It is only about three feet wide in\r\nmost places, widening here and there into pools six or eight feet in\r\ndiameter with no apparent current, the banks bossily rounded by the\r\ndown-curving mossy sod, grass panicles over-leaning like miniature pine\r\ntrees, and rugs of bryanthus spreading here and there over sunken\r\nboulders. At the foot of the meadow the stream, rich with the juices of\r\nthe plants it has refreshed, sings merrily down over shelving rock\r\nledges on its way to the Tuolumne River. The sublime, massive Mount Dana\r\nand its companions, green, red, and white, loom impressively above the\r\npines along the eastern horizon; a range or spur of gray rugged granite\r\ncrags and mountains on the north; the curiously crested and battlemented\r\nMount Hoffman on the west; and the Cathedral Range on the south with\r\nits grand Cathedral Peak, Cathedral Spires, Unicorn Peak, and several\r\nothers, gray and pointed or massively rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TUOLUMNE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 22._ Clouds none, cool west wind, slight hoarfrost on the\r\nmeadows. Carlo is missing; have been seeking him all day. In the thick\r\nwoods between camp and the river, among tall grass and fallen pines, I\r\ndiscovered a baby fawn. At first it seemed inclined to come to me; but\r\nwhen I tried to catch it, and got within a rod or two, it turned and\r\nwalked softly away, choosing its steps like a cautious, stealthy,\r\nhunting cat. Then, as if suddenly called or alarmed, it began to buck\r\nand run like a grown deer, jumping high above the fallen trunks, and was\r\nsoon out of sight. Possibly its mother may have called it, but I did not\r\nhear her. I don’t think fawns ever leave the home thicket or follow\r\ntheir mothers until they are called or frightened. I am distressed about\r\nCarlo. There are several other camps and dogs not many miles from here,\r\nand I still hope to find him. He never left me before. Panthers are very\r\nrare here, and I don’t think any of these cats would dare touch him. He\r\nknows bears too well to be caught by them, and as for Indians, they\r\ndon’t want him.\r\n\r\n_August 23._ Cool, bright day, hinting Indian summer. Mr. Delaney has\r\ngone to the Smith Ranch, on the Tuolumne below Hetch-Hetchy Valley,\r\nthirty-five or forty miles from here, so I’ll be alone for a week or\r\nmore,—not really alone, for Carlo has come back. He was at a camp a few\r\nmiles to the northwestward. He looked sheepish and ashamed when I asked\r\nhim where he had been and why he had gone away without leave. He is now\r\ntrying to get me to caress him and show signs of forgiveness. A wondrous\r\nwise dog. A great load is off my mind. I could not have left the\r\nmountains without him. He seems very glad to get back to me.\r\n\r\nRose and crimson sunset, and soon after the stars appeared the moon rose\r\nin most impressive majesty over the top of Mount Dana. I sauntered up\r\nthe meadow in the white light. The jet-black tree-shadows were so\r\nwonderfully distinct and substantial looking, I often stepped high in\r\ncrossing them, taking them for black charred logs.\r\n\r\n_August 24._ Another charming day, warm and calm soon after sunrise,\r\nclouds only about .01,—faint, silky cirrus wisps, scarcely visible.\r\nSlight frost, Indian summerish, the mountains growing softer in outline\r\nand dreamy looking, their rough angles melted off, apparently. Sky at\r\nevening with fine, dark, subdued purple, almost like the evening purple\r\nof the San Joaquin plains in settled weather. The moon is now gazing\r\nover the summit of Dana. Glorious exhilarating air. I wonder if in all\r\nthe world there is another mountain range of equal height blessed with\r\nweather so fine, and so openly kind and hospitable and approachable.\r\n\r\n_August 25._ Cool as usual in the morning, quickly changing to the\r\nordinary serene generous warmth and brightness. Toward evening the west\r\nwind was cool and sent us to the camp-fire. Of all Nature’s flowery\r\ncarpeted mountain halls none can be finer than this glacier meadow. Bees\r\nand butterflies seem as abundant as ever. The birds are still here,\r\nshowing no sign of leaving for winter quarters though the frost must\r\nbring them to mind. For my part I should like to stay here all winter or\r\nall my life or even all eternity.\r\n\r\n_August 26._ Frost this morning; all the meadow grass and some of the\r\npine needles sparkling with irised crystals,—flowers of light. Large\r\npicturesque clouds, craggy like rocks, are piled on Mount Dana, reddish\r\nin color like the mountain itself; the sky for a few degrees around the\r\nhorizon is pale purple, into which the pines dip their spires with fine\r\neffect. Spent the day as usual looking about me, watching the changing\r\nlights, the ripening autumn colors of the grass, seeds, late-blooming\r\ngentians, asters, goldenrods; parting the meadow grass here and there\r\nand looking down into the underworld of mosses and liverworts; watching\r\nthe busy ants and beetles and other small people at work and play like\r\nsquirrels and bears in a forest; studying the formation of lakes and\r\nmeadows, moraines, mountain sculpture; making small beginnings in these\r\ndirections, charmed by the serene beauty of everything.\r\n\r\nThe day has been extra cloudy, though bright on the whole, for the\r\nclouds were brighter than common. Clouds about .15, which in Switzerland\r\nwould be considered extra clear. Probably more free sunshine falls on\r\nthis majestic range than on any other in the world I’ve ever seen or\r\nheard of. It has the brightest weather, brightest glacier-polished\r\nrocks, the greatest abundance of irised spray from its glorious\r\nwaterfalls, the brightest forests of silver firs and silver pines, more\r\nstar-shine, moonshine, and perhaps more crystal-shine than any other\r\nmountain chain, and its countless mirror lakes, having more light poured\r\ninto them, glow and spangle most. And how glorious the shining after the\r\nshort summer showers and after frosty nights when the morning sunbeams\r\nare pouring through the crystals on the grass and pine needles, and how\r\nineffably spiritually fine is the morning-glow on the mountain-tops and\r\nthe alpenglow of evening. Well may the Sierra be named, not the Snowy\r\nRange, but the Range of Light.\r\n\r\n_August 27._ Clouds only .05,—mostly white and pink cumuli over the\r\nHoffman spur towards evening,—frosty morning. Crystals grow in\r\nmarvelous beauty and perfection of form these still nights, every one\r\nbuilt as carefully as the grandest holiest temple, as if planned to\r\nendure forever.\r\n\r\nContemplating the lace-like fabric of streams outspread over the\r\nmountains, we are reminded that everything is flowing—going somewhere,\r\nanimals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water. Thus the snow\r\nflows fast or slow in grand beauty-making glaciers and avalanches; the\r\nair in majestic floods carrying minerals, plant leaves, seeds, spores,\r\nwith streams of music and fragrance; water streams carrying rocks both\r\nin solution and in the form of mud particles, sand, pebbles, and\r\nboulders. Rocks flow from volcanoes like water from springs, and animals\r\nflock together and flow in currents modified by stepping, leaping,\r\ngliding, flying, swimming, etc. While the stars go streaming through\r\nspace pulsed on and on forever like blood globules in Nature’s warm\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n_August 28._ The dawn a glorious song of color. Sky absolutely\r\ncloudless. A fine crop hoarfrost. Warm after ten o’clock. The gentians\r\ndon’t mind the first frost though their petals seem so delicate; they\r\nclose every night as if going to sleep, and awake fresh as ever in the\r\nmorning sun-glory. The grass is a shade browner since last week, but\r\nthere are no nipped wilted plants of any sort as far as I have seen.\r\nButterflies and the grand host of smaller flies are benumbed every\r\nnight, but they hover and dance in the sunbeams over the meadows before\r\nnoon with no apparent lack of playful, joyful life. Soon they must all\r\nfall like petals in an orchard, dry and wrinkled, not a wing of all the\r\nmighty host left to tingle the air. Nevertheless new myriads will arise\r\nin the spring, rejoicing, exulting, as if laughing cold death to scorn.\r\n\r\n_August 29._ Clouds about .05, slight frost. Bland serene Indian summer\r\nweather. Have been gazing all day at the mountains, watching the\r\nchanging lights. More and more plainly are they clothed with light as a\r\ngarment, white tinged with pale purple, palest during the midday hours,\r\nrichest in the morning and evening. Everything seems consciously\r\npeaceful, thoughtful, faithfully waiting God’s will.\r\n\r\n_August 30._ This day just like yesterday. A few clouds motionless and\r\napparently with no work to do beyond looking beautiful. Frost enough\r\nfor crystal building,—glorious fields of ice-diamonds destined to last\r\nbut a night. How lavish is Nature building, pulling down, creating,\r\ndestroying, chasing every material particle from form to form, ever\r\nchanging, ever beautiful.\r\n\r\nMr. Delaney arrived this morning. Felt not a trace of loneliness while\r\nhe was gone. On the contrary, I never enjoyed grander company. The whole\r\nwilderness seems to be alive and familiar, full of humanity. The very\r\nstones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly. No wonder when we\r\nconsider that we all have the same Father and Mother.\r\n\r\n_August 31._ Clouds .05. Silky cirrus wisps and fringes so fine they\r\nalmost escape notice. Frost enough for another crop of crystals on the\r\nmeadows but none on the forests. The gentians, goldenrods, asters, etc.,\r\ndon’t seem to feel it; neither petals nor leaves are touched though they\r\nseem so tender. Every day opens and closes like a flower, noiseless,\r\neffortless. Divine peace glows on all the majestic landscape like the\r\nsilent enthusiastic joy that sometimes transfigures a noble human face.\r\n\r\n_September 1._ Clouds .05—motionless, of no particular color—ornaments\r\nwith no hint of rain or snow in them. Day all calm—another grand throb\r\nof Nature’s heart, ripening late flowers and seeds for next summer, full\r\nof life and the thoughts and plans of life to come, and full of ripe and\r\nready death beautiful as life, telling divine wisdom and goodness and\r\nimmortality. Have been up Mount Dana, making haste to see as much as I\r\ncan now that the time of departure is drawing nigh. The views from the\r\nsummit reach far and wide, eastward over the Mono Lake and Desert;\r\nmountains beyond mountains looking strangely barren and gray and bare\r\nlike heaps of ashes dumped from the sky. The lake, eight or ten miles in\r\ndiameter, shines like a burnished disk of silver, no trees about its\r\ngray, ashy, cindery shores. Looking westward, the glorious forests are\r\nseen sweeping over countless ridges and hills, girdling domes and\r\nsubordinate mountains, fringing in long curving lines the dividing\r\nridges, and filling every hollow where the glaciers have spread\r\nsoil-beds however rocky or smooth. Looking northward and southward along\r\nthe axis of the range, you see the glorious array of high mountains,\r\ncrags and peaks and snow, the fountain-heads of rivers that are flowing\r\nwest to the sea through the famous Golden Gate, and east to hot salt\r\nlakes and deserts to evaporate and hurry back into the sky. Innumerable\r\nlakes are shining like eyes beneath heavy rock brows, bare or tree\r\nfringed, or imbedded in black forests. Meadow openings in the woods seem\r\nas numerous as the lakes or perhaps more so. Far up the moraine-covered\r\nslopes and among crumbling rocks I found many delicate hardy plants,\r\nsome of them still in flower. The best gains of this trip were the\r\nlessons of unity and interrelation of all the features of the landscape\r\nrevealed in general views. The lakes and meadows are located just where\r\nthe ancient glaciers bore heaviest at the foot of the steepest parts of\r\ntheir channels, and of course their longest diameters are approximately\r\nparallel with each other and with the belts of forests growing in long\r\ncurving lines on the lateral and medial moraines, and in broad\r\noutspreading fields on the terminal beds deposited toward the end of the\r\nice period when the glaciers were receding. The domes, ridges, and spurs\r\nalso show the influence of glacial action in their forms, which\r\napproximately seem to be the forms of greatest strength with reference\r\nto the stress of oversweeping, past-sweeping, down-grinding ice-streams;\r\nsurvivals of the most resisting masses, or those most favorably\r\nsituated. How interesting everything is! Every rock, mountain, stream,\r\nplant, lake, lawn, forest, garden, bird, beast, insect seems to call\r\nand invite us to come and learn something of its history and\r\nrelationship. But shall the poor ignorant scholar be allowed to try the\r\nlessons they offer? It seems too great and good to be true. Soon I’ll be\r\ngoing to the lowlands. The bread camp must soon be removed. If I had a\r\nfew sacks of flour, an axe, and some matches, I would build a cabin of\r\npine logs, pile up plenty of firewood about it and stay all winter to\r\nsee the grand fertile snow-storms, watch the birds and animals that\r\nwinter thus high, how they live, how the forests look snow-laden or\r\nburied, and how the avalanches look and sound on their way down the\r\nmountains. But now I’ll have to go, for there is nothing to spare in the\r\nway of provisions. I’ll surely be back, however, surely I’ll be back. No\r\nother place has ever so overwhelmingly attracted me as this hospitable,\r\nGodful wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE HIGHEST MOUNT RITTER FOUNTAINS]\r\n\r\n_September 2._ A grand, red, rosy, crimson day,—a perfect glory of a\r\nday. What it means I don’t know. It is the first marked change from\r\ntranquil sunshine with purple mornings and evenings and still, white\r\nnoons. There is nothing like a storm, however. The average cloudiness\r\nonly about .08, and there is no sighing in the woods to betoken a big\r\nweather change. The sky was red in the morning and evening, the color\r\nnot diffused like the ordinary purple glow, but loaded upon separate\r\nwell-defined clouds that remained motionless, as if anchored around the\r\njagged mountain-fenced horizon. A deep-red cap, bluffy around its sides,\r\nlingered a long time on Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, drooping so low as\r\nto hide most of their bases, but leaving Dana’s round summit free, which\r\nseemed to float separate and alone over the big crimson cloud. Mammoth\r\nMountain, to the south of Gibbs and Bloody Cañon, striped and spotted\r\nwith snow-banks and clumps of dwarf pine, was also favored with a\r\nglorious crimson cap, in the making of which there was no trace of\r\neconomy—a huge bossy pile colored with a perfect passion of crimson\r\nthat seemed important enough to be sent off to burn among the stars in\r\nmajestic independence. One is constantly reminded of the infinite\r\nlavishness and fertility of Nature—inexhaustible abundance amid what\r\nseems enormous waste. And yet when we look into any of her operations\r\nthat lie within reach of our minds, we learn that no particle of her\r\nmaterial is wasted or worn out. It is eternally flowing from use to use,\r\nbeauty to yet higher beauty; and we soon cease to lament waste and\r\ndeath, and rather rejoice and exult in the imperishable, unspendable\r\nwealth of the universe, and faithfully watch and wait the reappearance\r\nof everything that melts and fades and dies about us, feeling sure that\r\nits next appearance will be better and more beautiful than the last.\r\n\r\nI watched the growth of these red-lands of the sky as eagerly as if new\r\nmountain ranges were being built. Soon the group of snowy peaks in whose\r\nrecesses lie the highest fountains of the Tuolumne, Merced, and North\r\nFork of the San Joaquin were decorated with majestic colored clouds like\r\nthose already described, but more complicated, to correspond with the\r\ngrand fountain-heads of the rivers they overshadowed. The Sierra\r\nCathedral, to the south of camp, was overshadowed like Sinai. Never\r\nbefore noticed so fine a union of rock and cloud in form and color and\r\nsubstance, drawing earth and sky together as one; and so human is it,\r\nevery feature and tint of color goes to one’s heart, and we shout,\r\nexulting in wild enthusiasm as if all the divine show were our own. More\r\nand more, in a place like this, we feel ourselves part of wild Nature,\r\nkin to everything. Spent most of the day high up on the north rim of the\r\nvalley, commanding views of the clouds in all their red glory spreading\r\ntheir wonderful light over all the basin, while the rocks and trees and\r\nsmall Alpine plants at my feet seemed hushed and thoughtful, as if they\r\nalso were conscious spectators of the glorious new cloud-world.\r\n\r\nHere and there, as I plodded farther and higher, I came to small\r\ngarden-patches and ferneries just where one would naturally decide that\r\nno plant-creature could possibly live. But, as in the region about the\r\nhead of Mono Pass and the top of Dana, it was in the wildest, highest\r\nplaces that the most beautiful and tender and enthusiastic plant-people\r\nwere found. Again and again, as I lingered over these charming plants, I\r\nsaid, How came you here? How do you live through the winter? Our roots,\r\nthey explained, reach far down the joints of the summer-warmed rocks,\r\nand beneath our fine snow mantle killing frosts cannot reach us, while\r\nwe sleep away the dark half of the year dreaming of spring.\r\n\r\nEver since I was allowed entrance into these mountains I have been\r\nlooking for cassiope, said to be the most beautiful and best loved of\r\nthe heathworts, but, strange to say, I have not yet found it. On my high\r\nmountain walks I keep muttering, “Cassiope, cassiope.” This name, as\r\nCalvinists say, is driven in upon me, notwithstanding the glorious host\r\nof plants that come about me uncalled as soon as I show myself. Cassiope\r\nseems the highest name of all the small mountain-heath people, and as\r\nif conscious of her worth, keeps out of my way. I must find her soon, if\r\nat all this year.\r\n\r\n_September 4._ All the vast sky dome is clear, filled only with mellow\r\nIndian summer light. The pine and hemlock and fir cones are nearly ripe\r\nand are falling fast from morning to night, cut off and gathered by the\r\nbusy squirrels. Almost all the plants have matured their seeds, their\r\nsummer work done; and the summer crop of birds and deer will soon be\r\nable to follow their parents to the foothills and plains at the approach\r\nof winter, when the snow begins to fly.\r\n\r\n_September 5._ No clouds. Weather cool, calm, bright as if no great\r\nthing was yet ready to be done. Have been sketching the North Tuolumne\r\nChurch. The sunset gloriously colored.\r\n\r\n_September 6._ Still another perfectly cloudless day, purple evening and\r\nmorning, all the middle hours one mass of pure serene sunshine. Soon\r\nafter sunrise the air grew warm, and there was no wind. One naturally\r\nhalted to see what Nature intended to do. There is a suggestion of real\r\nIndian summer in the hushed brooding, faintly hazy weather. The yellow\r\natmosphere, though thin, is still plainly of the same general character\r\nas that of eastern Indian summer. The peculiar mellowness is perhaps in\r\npart caused by myriads of ripe spores adrift in the sky.\r\n\r\nMr. Delaney now keeps up a solemn talk about the need of getting away\r\nfrom these high mountains, telling sad stories of flocks that perished\r\nin storms that broke suddenly into the midst of fine innocent weather\r\nlike this we are now enjoying. “In no case,” said he, “will I venture to\r\nstay so high and far back in the mountains as we now are later than the\r\nmiddle of this month, no matter how warm and sunny it may be.” He would\r\nmove the flock slowly at first, a few miles a day until the Yosemite\r\nCreek basin was reached and crossed, then while lingering in the heavy\r\npine woods should the weather threaten he could hurry down to the\r\nfoothills, where the snow never falls deep enough to smother a sheep. Of\r\ncourse I am anxious to see as much of the wilderness as possible in the\r\nfew days left me, and I say again,—May the good time come when I can\r\nstay as long as I like with plenty of bread, far and free from trampling\r\nflocks, though I may well be thankful for this generous foodful\r\ninspiring summer. Anyhow we never know where we must go nor what guides\r\nwe are to get,—men, storms, guardian angels, or sheep. Perhaps almost\r\neverybody in the least natural is guarded more than he is ever aware\r\nof. All the wilderness seems to be full of tricks and plans to drive and\r\ndraw us up into God’s Light.\r\n\r\nHave been busy planning, and baking bread for at least one more good\r\nwild excursion among the high peaks, and surely none, however hopefully\r\naiming at fortune or fame, ever felt so gloriously happily excited by\r\nthe outlook.\r\n\r\n_September 7._ Left camp at daybreak and made direct for Cathedral Peak,\r\nintending to strike eastward and southward from that point among the\r\npeaks and ridges at the heads of the Tuolumne, Merced, and San Joaquin\r\nRivers. Down through the pine woods I made my way, across the Tuolumne\r\nRiver and meadows, and up the heavily timbered slope forming the south\r\nboundary of the upper Tuolumne basin, along the east side of Cathedral\r\nPeak, and up to its topmost spire, which I reached at noon, having\r\nloitered by the way to study the fine trees—two-leaved pine, mountain\r\npine, albicaulis pine, silver fir, and the most charming, most graceful\r\nof all the evergreens, the mountain hemlock. High, cool, late-flowering\r\nmeadows also detained me, and lakelets and avalanche tracks and huge\r\nquarries of moraine rocks above the forests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLACIER MEADOW STREWN WITH MORAINE BOULDERS 10,000 FEET\r\nABOVE THE SEA (NEAR MOUNT DANA)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT OF CATHEDRAL PEAK]\r\n\r\nAll the way up from the Big Meadows to the base of the Cathedral the\r\nground is covered with moraine material, the left lateral moraine of the\r\ngreat glacier that must have completely filled this upper Tuolumne\r\nbasin. Higher there are several small terminal moraines of residual\r\nglaciers shoved forward at right angles against the grand simple lateral\r\nof the main Tuolumne Glacier. A fine place to study mountain sculpture\r\nand soil making. The view from the Cathedral Spires is very fine and\r\ntelling in every direction. Innumerable peaks, ridges, domes, meadows,\r\nlakes, and woods; the forests extending in long curving lines and broad\r\nfields wherever the glaciers have left soil for them to grow on, while\r\nthe sides of the highest mountains show a straggling dwarf growth\r\nclinging to rifts in the rocks apparently independent of soil. The dark\r\nheath-like growth on the Cathedral roof I found to be dwarf snow-pressed\r\nalbicaulis pine, about three or four feet high, but very old looking.\r\nMany of them are bearing cones, and the noisy Clarke crow is eating the\r\nseeds, using his long bill like a woodpecker in digging them out of the\r\ncones. A good many flowers are still in bloom about the base of the\r\npeak, and even on the roof among the little pines, especially a woody\r\nyellow-flowered eriogonum and a handsome aster. The body of the\r\nCathedral is nearly square, and the roof slopes are wonderfully regular\r\nand symmetrical, the ridge trending northeast and southwest. This\r\ndirection has apparently been determined by structure joints in the\r\ngranite. The gable on the northeast end is magnificent in size and\r\nsimplicity, and at its base there is a big snow-bank protected by the\r\nshadow of the building. The front is adorned with many pinnacles and a\r\ntall spire of curious workmanship. Here too the joints in the rock are\r\nseen to have played an important part in determining their forms and\r\nsize and general arrangement. The Cathedral is said to be about eleven\r\nthousand feet above the sea, but the height of the building itself above\r\nthe level of the ridge it stands on is about fifteen hundred feet. A\r\nmile or so to the westward there is a handsome lake, and the\r\nglacier-polished granite about it is shining so brightly it is not easy\r\nin some places to trace the line between the rock and water, both\r\nshining alike. Of this lake with its silvery basin and bits of meadow\r\nand groves I have a fine view from the spires; also of Lake Tenaya,\r\nCloud’s Rest and the South Dome of Yosemite, Mount Starr King, Mount\r\nHoffman, the Merced peaks, and the vast multitude of snowy fountain\r\npeaks extending far north and south along the axis of the range. No\r\nfeature, however, of all the noble landscape as seen from here seems\r\nmore wonderful than the Cathedral itself, a temple displaying Nature’s\r\nbest masonry and sermons in stones. How often I have gazed at it from\r\nthe tops of hills and ridges, and through openings in the forests on my\r\nmany short excursions, devoutly wondering, admiring, longing! This I may\r\nsay is the first time I have been at church in California, led here at\r\nlast, every door graciously opened for the poor lonely worshiper. In our\r\nbest times everything turns into religion, all the world seems a church\r\nand the mountains altars. And lo, here at last in front of the Cathedral\r\nis blessed cassiope, ringing her thousands of sweet-toned bells, the\r\nsweetest church music I ever enjoyed. Listening, admiring, until late in\r\nthe afternoon I compelled myself to hasten away eastward back of rough,\r\nsharp, spiry, splintery peaks, all of them granite like the Cathedral,\r\nsparkling with crystals—feldspar, quartz, hornblende, mica, tourmaline.\r\nHad a rather difficult walk and creep across an immense snow and ice\r\ncliff which gradually increased in steepness as I advanced until it was\r\nalmost impassable. Slipped on a dangerous place, but managed to stop by\r\ndigging my heels into the thawing surface just on the brink of a\r\nyawning ice gulf. Camped beside a little pool and a group of crinkled\r\ndwarf pines; and as I sit by the fire trying to write notes the shallow\r\npool seems fathomless with the infinite starry heavens in it, while the\r\nonlooking rocks and trees, tiny shrubs and daisies and sedges, brought\r\nforward in the fire-glow, seem full of thought as if about to speak\r\naloud and tell all their wild stories. A marvelously impressive meeting\r\nin which every one has something worth while to tell. And beyond the\r\nfire-beams out in the solemn darkness, how impressive is the music of a\r\nchoir of rills singing their way down from the snow to the river! And\r\nwhen we call to mind that thousands of these rejoicing rills are\r\nassembled in each one of the main streams, we wonder the less that our\r\nSierra rivers are songful all the way to the sea.\r\n\r\nAbout sundown saw a flock of dun grayish sparrows going to roost in\r\ncrevices of a crag above the big snow-field. Charming little\r\nmountaineers! Found a species of sedge in flower within eight or ten\r\nfeet of a snow-bank. Judging by the looks of the ground, it can hardly\r\nhave been out in the sunshine much longer than a week, and it is likely\r\nto be buried again in fresh snow in a month or so, thus making a winter\r\nabout ten months long, while spring, summer, and autumn are crowded and\r\nhurried into two months. How delightful it is to be alone here! How wild\r\neverything is—wild as the sky and as pure! Never shall I forget this\r\nbig, divine day—the Cathedral and its thousands of cassiope bells, and\r\nthe landscapes around them, and this camp in the gray crags above the\r\nwoods, with its stars and streams and snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF UPPER TUOLUMNE VALLEY, with arrow pointing to Mt\r\nRitter]\r\n\r\n_September 8._ Day of climbing, scrambling, sliding on the peaks around\r\nthe highest source of the Tuolumne and Merced. Climbed three of the most\r\ncommanding of the mountains, whose names I don’t know; crossed streams\r\nand huge beds of ice and snow more than I could keep count of. Neither\r\ncould I keep count of the lakes scattered on tablelands and in the\r\ncirques of the peaks, and in chains in the cañons, linked together by\r\nthe streams—a tremendously wild gray wilderness of hacked, shattered\r\ncrags, ridges, and peaks, a few clouds drifting over and through the\r\nmidst of them as if looking for work. In general views all the immense\r\nround landscape seems raw and lifeless as a quarry, yet the most\r\ncharming flowers were found rejoicing in countless nooks and garden-like\r\npatches everywhere. I must have done three or four days’ climbing work\r\nin this one. Limbs perfectly tireless until near sundown, when I\r\ndescended into the main upper Tuolumne valley at the foot of Mount\r\nLyell, the camp still eight or ten miles distant. Going up through the\r\npine woods past the Soda Springs Dome in the dark, where there is much\r\nfallen timber, and when all the excitement of seeing things was wanting,\r\nI was tired. Arrived at the main camp at nine o’clock, and soon was\r\nsleeping sound as death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBACK TO THE LOWLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 9._ Weariness rested away and I feel eager and ready for\r\nanother excursion a month or two long in the same wonderful wilderness.\r\nNow, however, I must turn toward the lowlands, praying and hoping Heaven\r\nwill shove me back again.\r\n\r\nThe most telling thing learned in these mountain excursions is the\r\ninfluence of cleavage joints on the features sculptured from the general\r\nmass of the range. Evidently the denudation has been enormous, while the\r\ninevitable outcome is subtle balanced beauty. Comprehended in general\r\nviews, the features of the wildest landscape seem to be as harmoniously\r\nrelated as the features of a human face. Indeed, they look human and\r\nradiate spiritual beauty, divine thought, however covered and concealed\r\nby rock and snow.\r\n\r\nMr. Delaney has hardly had time to ask me how I enjoyed my trip, though\r\nhe has facilitated and encouraged my plans all summer, and declares I’ll\r\nbe famous some day, a kind guess that seems strange and incredible to a\r\nwandering wilderness-lover with never a thought or dream of fame while\r\nhumbly trying to trace and learn and enjoy Nature’s lessons.\r\n\r\nThe camp stuff is now packed on the horses, and the flock is headed for\r\nthe home ranch. Away we go, down through the pines, leaving the lovely\r\nlawn where we have camped so long. I wonder if I’ll ever see it again.\r\nThe sod is so tough and close it is scarcely at all injured by the\r\nsheep. Fortunately they are not fond of silky glacier meadow grass. The\r\nday is perfectly clear, not a cloud or the faintest hint of a cloud is\r\nvisible, and there is no wind. I wonder if in all the world, at a height\r\nof nine thousand feet, weather so steadily, faithfully calm and bright\r\nand hospitable may anywhere else be found. We are going away fearing\r\ndestructive storms, though it is difficult to conceive weather changes\r\nso great.\r\n\r\nThough the water is now low in the river, the usual difficulty occurred\r\nin getting the flock across it. Every sheep seemed to be invincibly\r\ndetermined to die any sort of dry death rather than wet its feet. Carlo\r\nhas learned the sheep business as perfectly as the best shepherd, and it\r\nis interesting to watch his intelligent efforts to push or frighten the\r\nsilly creatures into the water. They had to be fairly crowded and shoved\r\nover the bank; and when at last one crossed because it could not push\r\nits way back, the whole flock suddenly plunged in headlong together, as\r\nif the river was the only desirable part of the world. Aside from mere\r\nmoney profit one would rather herd wolves than sheep. As soon as they\r\nclambered up the opposite bank, they began baaing and feeding as if\r\nnothing unusual had happened. We crossed the meadows and drove slowly up\r\nthe south rim of the valley through the same woods I had passed on my\r\nway to Cathedral Peak, and camped for the night by the side of a small\r\npond on top of the big lateral moraine.\r\n\r\n_September 10._ In the morning at daybreak not one of the two thousand\r\nsheep was in sight. Examining the tracks, we discovered that they had\r\nbeen scattered, perhaps by a bear. In a few hours all were found and\r\ngathered into one flock again. Had fine view of a deer. How graceful and\r\nperfect in every way it seemed as compared with the silly, dusty,\r\ntousled sheep! From the high ground hereabouts had another grand view to\r\nthe northward—a heaving, swelling sea of domes and round-backed ridges\r\nfringed with pines, and bounded by innumerable sharp-pointed peaks, gray\r\nand barren-looking, though so full of beautiful life. Another day of the\r\ncalm, cloudless kind, purple in the morning and evening. The evening\r\nglow has been very marked for the last two or three weeks. Perhaps the\r\n“zodiacal light.”\r\n\r\n_September 11._ Cloudless. Slight frost. Calm. Fairly started downhill,\r\nand now are camped at the west end meadows of Lake Tenaya—a charming\r\nplace. Lake smooth as glass, mirroring its miles of glacier-polished\r\npavements and bold mountain walls. Find aster still in flower. Here is\r\nabout the upper limit of the dwarf form of the goldcup oak,—eight\r\nthousand feet above sea-level,—reaching about two thousand feet higher\r\nthan the California black oak (_Quercus Californica_). Lovely evening,\r\nthe lake reflections after dark marvelously impressive.\r\n\r\n_September 12._ Cloudless day, all pure sun-gold. Among the magnificent\r\nsilver firs once more, within two miles of the brink of Yosemite, at the\r\nfamous Portuguese bear camp. Chaparral of goldcup oak, manzanita, and\r\nceanothus abundant hereabouts, wanting about the Tuolumne meadows,\r\nalthough the elevation is but little higher there. The two-leaved pine,\r\nthough far more abundant about the Tuolumne meadow region, reaches its\r\ngreatest size on stream-sides hereabouts and around meadows that are\r\nrather boggy. All the best dry ground is taken by the magnificent silver\r\nfir, which here reaches its greatest size and forms a well-defined\r\nbelt. A glorious tree. Have fine bed of its boughs to-night.\r\n\r\n_September 13._ Camp this evening at Yosemite Creek, close to the\r\nstream, on a little sand flat near our old camp-ground. The vegetation\r\nis already brown and yellow and dry; the creek almost dry also. The\r\nslender form of the two-leaved pine on its banks is, I think, the\r\nhandsomest I have anywhere seen. It might easily pass at first sight for\r\na distinct species, though surely only a variety (_Murrayana_), due to\r\ncrowded and rapid growth on good soil. The yellow pine is as variable,\r\nor perhaps more so. The form here and a thousand feet higher, on\r\ncrumbling rocks, is broad branching, with closely furrowed, reddish\r\nbark, large cones, and long leaves. It is one of the hardiest of pines,\r\nand has wonderful vitality. The tassels of long, stout needles shining\r\nsilvery in the sun, when the wind is blowing them all in the same\r\ndirection, is one of the most splendid spectacles these glorious Sierra\r\nforests have to show. This variety of _Pinus ponderosa_ is regarded as a\r\ndistinct species, _Pinus Jeffreyi_, by some botanists. The basin of this\r\nfamous Yosemite stream is extremely rocky,—seems fairly to be paved\r\nwith domes like a street with big cobblestones. I wonder if I shall ever\r\nbe allowed to explore it. It draws me so strongly, I would make any\r\nsacrifice to try to read its lessons. I thank God for this glimpse of\r\nit. The charms of these mountains are beyond all common reason,\r\nunexplainable and mysterious as life itself.\r\n\r\n_September 14._ Nearly all day in magnificent fir forest, the top\r\nbranches laden with superb erect gray cones shining with beads of pure\r\nbalsam. The squirrels are cutting them off at a great rate. Bump, bump,\r\nI hear them falling, soon to be gathered and stored for winter bread.\r\nThose that chance to be left by the industrious harvesters drop the\r\nscales and bracts when fully ripe, and it is fine to see the\r\npurple-winged seeds flying in swirling, merry-looking flocks seeking\r\ntheir fortunes. The bole and dead limbs of nearly every tree in the main\r\nforest-belt are ornamented by conspicuous tufts and strips of a yellow\r\nlichen.\r\n\r\nCamped for the night at Cascade Creek, near the Mono Trail crossing.\r\nManzanita berries now ripe. Cloudiness to-day about .10. The sunset very\r\nrich, flaming purple and crimson showing gloriously through the aisles\r\nof the woods.\r\n\r\n_September 15._ The weather pure gold, cloudiness about .05, white\r\ncirrus flects and pencilings around the horizon. Move two or three miles\r\nand camp at Tamarack Flat. Wandering in the woods here back of the pines\r\nwhich bound the meadows, I found very noble specimens of the\r\nmagnificent silver fir, the tallest about two hundred and forty feet\r\nhigh and five feet in diameter four feet from the ground.\r\n\r\n_September 16._ Crawled slowly four or five miles to-day through the\r\nglorious forest to Crane Flat, where we are camped for the night. The\r\nforests we so admired in summer seem still more beautiful and sublime in\r\nthis mellow autumn light. Lovely starry night, the tall, spiring\r\ntree-tops relieved in jet black against the sky. I linger by the fire,\r\nloath to go to bed.\r\n\r\n_September 17._ Left camp early. Ran over the Tuolumne divide and down a\r\nfew miles to a grove of sequoias that I had heard of, directed by the\r\nDon. They occupy an area of perhaps less than a hundred acres. Some of\r\nthe trees are noble, colossal old giants, surrounded by magnificent\r\nsugar pines and Douglas spruces. The perfect specimens not burned or\r\nbroken are singularly regular and symmetrical, though not at all\r\nconventional, showing infinite variety in general unity and harmony; the\r\nnoble shafts with rich purplish brown fluted bark, free of limbs for one\r\nhundred and fifty feet or so, ornamented here and there with leafy\r\nrosettes; main branches of the oldest trees very large, crooked and\r\nrugged, zigzagging stiffly outward seemingly lawless, yet unexpectedly\r\nstooping just at the right distance from the trunk and dissolving in\r\ndense bossy masses of branchlets, thus making a regular though greatly\r\nvaried outline,—a cylinder of leafy, outbulging spray masses,\r\nterminating in a noble dome, that may be recognized while yet far off\r\nupheaved against the sky above the dark bed of pines and firs and\r\nspruces, the king of all conifers, not only in size but in sublime\r\nmajesty of behavior and port. I found a black, charred stump about\r\nthirty feet in diameter and eighty or ninety feet high—a venerable,\r\nimpressive old monument of a tree that in its prime may have been the\r\nmonarch of the grove; seedlings and saplings growing up here and there,\r\nthrifty and hopeful, giving no hint of the dying out of the species. Not\r\nany unfavorable change of climate, but only fire, threatens the\r\nexistence of these noblest of God’s trees. Sorry I was not able to get a\r\ncount of the old monument’s annual rings.\r\n\r\nCamp this evening at Hazel Green, on the broad back of the dividing\r\nridge near our old camp-ground when we were on the way up the mountains\r\nin the spring. This ridge has the finest sugar-pine groves and finest\r\nmanzanita and ceanothus thickets I have yet found on all this wonderful\r\nsummer journey.\r\n\r\n_September 18._ Made a long descent on the south side of the divide to\r\nBrown’s Flat, the grand forests now left above us, though the sugar pine\r\nstill flourishes fairly well, and with the yellow pine, libocedrus, and\r\nDouglas spruce, makes forests that would be considered most wonderful in\r\nany other part of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Indians here, with great concern, pointed to an old garden patch on\r\nthe flat and told us to keep away from it. Perhaps some of their tribe\r\nare buried here.\r\n\r\n_September 19._ Camped this evening at Smith’s Mill, on the first broad\r\nmountain bench or plateau reached in ascending the range, where pines\r\ngrow large enough for good lumber. Here wheat, apples, peaches, and\r\ngrapes grow, and we were treated to wine and apples. The wine I didn’t\r\nlike, but Mr. Delaney and the Indian driver and the shepherd seemed to\r\nthink the stuff divine. Compared to sparkling Sierra water fresh from\r\nthe heavens, it seemed a dull, muddy, stupid drink. But the apples, best\r\nof fruits, how delicious they were—fit for gods or men.\r\n\r\nOn the way down from Brown’s Flat we stopped at Bower Cave, and I spent\r\nan hour in it—one of the most novel and interesting of all Nature’s\r\nunderground mansions. Plenty of sunlight pours into it through the\r\nleaves of the four maple trees growing in its mouth, illuminating its\r\nclear, calm pool and marble chambers,—a charming place, ravishingly\r\nbeautiful, but the accessible parts of the walls sadly disfigured with\r\nnames of vandals.\r\n\r\n_September 20._ The weather still golden and calm, but hot. We are now\r\nin the foot-hills, and all the conifers are left behind, except the gray\r\nSabine pine. Camped at the Dutch Boy’s Ranch, where there are extensive\r\nbarley fields now showing nothing save dusty stubble.\r\n\r\n_September 21._ A terribly hot, dusty, sunburned day, and as nothing was\r\nto be gained by loitering where the flock could find nothing to eat save\r\nthorny twigs and chaparral, we made a long drive, and before sundown\r\nreached the home ranch on the yellow San Joaquin plain.\r\n\r\n_September 22._ The sheep were let out of the corral one by one, this\r\nmorning, and counted, and strange to say, after all their adventurous\r\nwanderings in bewildering rocks and brush and streams, scattered by\r\nbears, poisoned by azalea, kalmia, alkali, all are accounted for. Of the\r\ntwo thousand and fifty that left the corral in the spring lean and weak,\r\ntwo thousand and twenty-five have returned fat and strong. The losses\r\nare: ten killed by bears, one by a rattlesnake, one that had to be\r\nkilled after it had broken its leg on a boulder slope, and one that ran\r\naway in blind terror on being accidentally separated from the\r\nflock,—thirteen all told. Of the other twelve doomed never to return,\r\nthree were sold to ranchmen and nine were made camp mutton.\r\n\r\nHere ends my forever memorable first High Sierra excursion. I have\r\ncrossed the Range of Light, surely the brightest and best of all the\r\nLord has built; and rejoicing in its glory, I gladly, gratefully,\r\nhopefully pray I may see it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Abies concolor_ and _magnifica_. _See_ Fir, silver.\r\n\r\n    Abronia, 228.\r\n\r\n    _Adenostoma fasciculata_, 14, 19, 20.\r\n\r\n    _Adiantum Chilense_, 17.\r\n\r\n    Alpenglow, 220.\r\n\r\n    Alvord, Gen.
