In the earlier chapters I have tried to give a brief\r\nsketch of the growing and marketing of wheat. If I have succeeded, the\r\nreader will realise that the farmer’s share in the production of the\r\nstaple food of the people is by no means the simple affair it appears\r\nto be. The various operations of farming are so closely interdependent\r\nthat even the most complex book-keeping may fail to disentangle the\r\naccounts so as to decide with certainty whether or not any innovation\r\nis profitable. The farmer, especially the small farmer, spends his days\r\nin the open air, and does not feel inclined to indulge in analytical\r\nbook-keeping in the evening. Consequently, the onus of demonstrating\r\nthe economy of suggested innovations in practice lies with those who\r\nmake the suggestions. This is one of the many difficulties which\r\nconfronts everyone who sets out to improve agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn the third and fourth chapters I have discussed the quality of wheat.\r\nI have tried to describe the investigations which are in progress with\r\nthe object of improving wheat from the point of view of both the farmer\r\nand the miller, and to give some account of the success with which they\r\nhave been attended. Incidentally I have pointed out the difficulties\r\nwhich pursue any investigation which involves the cultivation\r\non the large scale of such a crop as wheat, and the consequent\r\nneed of adopting due precautions to ensure accuracy before making\r\nrecommendations to the farmer. Advice based on insufficient evidence is\r\nmore than likely to be misleading. Every piece of misleading advice is\r\na definite handicap to the progress of agricultural science.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapter is devoted to a short outline of the milling\r\nindustry. In chapter VI the process of baking is described. In the last\r\ntwo chapters the composition of bread is discussed at some length. I\r\nhave tried to state definitely and without bias which points in this\r\nmuch debated subject are known with some certainty, and which points\r\nrequire further investigation.\r\n\r\nThroughout the following pages, but especially in chapters III and IV,\r\nI have drawn freely upon the work of my colleagues. I am also much\r\nindebted to my friends, Mr A. E. Humphries, the chairman of the Home\r\nGrown Wheat Committee, and Mr E. S. Beaven of Warminster, whose advice\r\nhas always been at my disposal. A list of publications on the various\r\nbranches of the subject will be found at the end of the volume.\r\n\r\n  T. B.

It will grow on almost\r\nany kind of soil, and in almost any temperate climate. But the question\r\nwhich concerns the wheat grower is not whether he can grow wheat, but\r\nwhether he can grow it profitably. This is a question of course that\r\ncan never receive a final answer. Any increase in the price of wheat,\r\nor any improvement that lowers the cost of cultivation, may enable\r\ngrowers who cannot succeed under present conditions to grow wheat at\r\na profit. Thus if the population of the world increases, and wheat\r\nbecomes scarce, the wheat-growing area will doubtless be extended\r\nto districts where wheat cannot be grown profitably under present\r\nconditions. A study of the history of wheat-growing in this country\r\nduring the last century shows that the reverse of this took place.\r\nIn the first half of that period the population had increased, and\r\nfrom lack of transport facilities and other causes the importation of\r\nforeign wheat was small. Prices were high in consequence and every\r\nacre of available land was under wheat. As transport facilities\r\nincreased wheat-growing areas were developed in Canada, in the\r\nWestern States of America, in the Argentine, and in Australia, and\r\nthe importation of foreign wheat increased enormously. This led to\r\na rapid decrease in prices, and wheat-growing had to be abandoned\r\non all but the most suitable soils in the British Isles. From 1880\r\nonwards thousands of acres of land which had grown wheat profitably\r\nfor many years were laid down to grass. In the last decade the world’s\r\npopulation has increased faster than the wheat-growing area has been\r\nextended. Prices have consequently risen, and the area under wheat in\r\nthe British Isles will no doubt increase.\r\n\r\nBut although it cannot be stated with finality on what land wheat can\r\nbe grown, or cannot be grown, at a profit, nevertheless accumulated\r\nexperience has shown that wheat grows best on the heavier kinds of\r\nloam soils where the rainfall is between 20 and 30 inches per annum.\r\nIt grows nearly as well on clay soils and on lighter loams, and with\r\nthe methods of dry farming followed in the arid regions of the Western\r\nStates and Canada, it will succeed with less than its normal amount of\r\nrainfall.\r\n\r\nIt is now about a hundred years since chemistry was applied with any\r\napproach to exactitude to questions affecting agriculture; since for\r\ninstance it was first definitely recognised that plants must obtain\r\nfrom their surroundings the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, and other elements of which\r\ntheir substance is composed. For many years there was naturally much\r\nuncertainty as to the source from which these several elements were\r\nderived. Experiment soon showed that carbon was undoubtedly taken\r\nfrom the air, and that its source was the carbon dioxide poured into\r\nthe air by fires and by the breathing of animals. It soon became\r\nobvious too that plants obtain from the soil water and inorganic salts\r\ncontaining phosphorus, sulphur, potassium, calcium, and so on; but\r\nfor a long time the source of the plants’ supply of nitrogen was not\r\ndefinitely decided. Four-fifths of the air was known to be nitrogen.\r\nThe soil was known to contain a small percentage of that element, which\r\nhowever amounts to four or five tons per acre. Which was the source\r\nof the plants’ nitrogen could be decided only by careful experiment.\r\nAs late as 1840 Liebig, perhaps the greatest chemist of his day,\r\nwrote a book on the application of chemistry to agriculture. In it he\r\nstated that plants could obtain from the air all the nitrogen they\r\nrequired, and that, to produce a full crop, it was only necessary to\r\nensure that the soil should provide a sufficient supply of the mineral\r\nelements, as he called them, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, etc.\r\nNow of all the elements which the farmer has to buy for application\r\nto his land as manure, nitrogen is the most costly. At the present\r\ntime nitrogen in manures costs sevenpence per pound, whilst a pound\r\nof phosphorus in manures can be bought for fivepence, and a pound\r\nof potassium for twopence. The importance of deciding whether it is\r\nnecessary to use nitrogen in manures needs no further comment. It\r\nwas to settle definitely questions like this that John Bennet Lawes\r\nbegan his experiments at his home at Rothamsted, near Harpenden in\r\nHertfordshire, on the manuring of crops. These experiments were started\r\nalmost simultaneously with the publication of Liebig’s book, and many\r\nof Lawes’ original plots laid out over 70 years ago are still in\r\nexistence. The results which he obtained in collaboration with his\r\nscientific colleague, Joseph Henry Gilbert, soon overthrew Liebig’s\r\nmineral theory of manuring, and showed that in order to grow full crops\r\nof wheat it is above all things necessary to ensure that the soil\r\nshould be able to supply plenty of nitrogen. Thus it was found that the\r\nsoil of the Rothamsted Experiment Station was capable of growing wheat\r\ncontinuously year after year. With no manure the average crop was only\r\nabout 13 bushels per acre. The addition of a complete mineral manure\r\ncontaining phosphorus, calcium, potassium, in fact all the plant wants\r\nfrom the soil except nitrogen, only increased the crop to 15 bushels\r\nper acre. Manuring with nitrogen on the other hand increased the crop\r\nto 21 bushels per acre. Obviously on the Rothamsted soil wheat has\r\ngreat difficulty in getting all the nitrogen it wants, but is well\r\nable to fend for itself as regards what Liebig called minerals. This\r\nkind of experiment has been repeated on almost every kind of soil in\r\nthe United Kingdom, and it is found that the inability of wheat to\r\nsupply itself with nitrogen applies to all soils, except the black\r\nsoils of the Fens which contain about ten times more nitrogen than the\r\nordinary arable soils of the country. It is the richness in nitrogen\r\nof the virgin soils of the Western States and Canada, and of the black\r\nsoils of Russia, that forms one of the chief factors in their success\r\nas wheat-growing lands. It must be added, however, that continuous\r\ncropping without manure must in time exhaust the stores of nitrogen in\r\neven the richest soil, and when this time comes the farmers in these\r\nat present favoured regions will undoubtedly find wheat-growing more\r\ncostly by whatever sum per acre they may find it necessary to expend\r\nin nitrogenous manure. The world’s demand for nitrogenous manure is\r\ntherefore certain to increase. Such considerations as these inspired\r\nSir William Crookes’ Presidential address to the British Association in\r\n1898, in which he foretold the probability of a nitrogen famine, and\r\nexplained how it must lead to a shortage in the world’s wheat supply.\r\nThe remedy he suggested was the utilization of water-power to provide\r\nthe energy for generating electricity, by means of which the free\r\nnitrogen of the air should be brought into combination in such forms\r\nthat it could be used for manure. It is interesting to note that these\r\nsuggestions have been put into practice. In Norway, in Germany, and in\r\nAmerica waterfalls have been made to drive dynamos, and the electricity\r\nthus generated has been used to make two new nitrogenous manures,\r\ncalcium nitrate and calcium cyanamide, which are now coming on to the\r\nmarket at prices which will compete with sulphate of ammonia from the\r\ngas works, nitrate of soda from Chili, Peruvian guano, and the various\r\nplant and animal refuse materials which have up to the present supplied\r\nthe farmer with his nitrogenous manures. This is welcome news to the\r\nwheat grower, for the price of manurial nitrogen has steadily risen\r\nduring the last decade.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the question of manuring one more point from the\r\nRothamsted experiments must be referred to. It has already been\r\nmentioned that when manured with nitrogen alone the Rothamsted soil\r\nproduced 21 bushels of wheat per acre. When, however, a complete manure\r\ncontaining both nitrogen and minerals was used the crop rose to 35\r\nbushels per acre which is about the average yield per acre of wheat in\r\nEngland. This shows that although the yield of wheat is dependent in\r\nthe first place on the nitrogen supplied by the soil, it is still far\r\nfrom independent of a proper supply of minerals. A further experiment\r\non this point showed that minerals are not used up by the crop to which\r\nthey are applied, and that any excess left over remains in the soil\r\nfor next year. This is not the case with nitrogenous manures. Whatever\r\nis left over from one crop is washed out of the soil by the winter\r\nrains, and lost. Translated into farm practice these results mean that\r\nnitrogenous manures should be applied direct to the wheat crop, but\r\nthat wheat may as a rule be trusted to get all the minerals it wants\r\nfrom the phosphate and potash applied directly to other crops which are\r\nspecially dependent on an abundant supply of these substances.\r\n\r\nAt Rothamsted, Lawes and Gilbert adopted the practice of growing wheat\r\ncontinuously on the same land year after year in order to find out\r\nas quickly as possible the manurial peculiarities of the crop. This\r\nhowever is not the general system of the British farmer, but it has\r\nbeen carried out with commercial success by Mr Prout of Sawbridgeworth\r\nin Hertfordshire. The Sawbridgeworth farm is heavy land on the London\r\nclay. Mr Prout’s system was to cultivate the land by steam power, to\r\nmanure on the lines suggested by the Rothamsted experiments, and to\r\nsell both grain and straw. Wheat was grown continuously year after year\r\nuntil the soil became infested with weeds, when some kind of root crop\r\nwas grown to give an opportunity to clean the land. A root crop is not\r\nsown until June so that the land is bare for cleaning all the spring\r\nand early summer. Such crops also are grown in rows two feet or more\r\napart, and cultural implements can be used between the rows of plants\r\nuntil the latter cover the soil by the end of July or August. After\r\ncleaning the land in this way the roots are removed from the land in\r\nthe winter and used to feed the stock. By this time it is too late to\r\nsow wheat, so a barley crop is sown the following spring, and with the\r\nbarley clover is sown. Clover is an exception to the rule that crops\r\nmust get their nitrogen from the soil.\r\n\r\nOn the roots of clover, and other plants of the same botanical order,\r\nsuch as lucerne, sainfoin, beans and peas, many small swellings are\r\nto be found. These swellings, or nodules as they are usually called,\r\nare produced by bacteria which possess the power of abstracting free\r\nnitrogen from the air and transforming it into combined nitrogen in\r\nsuch a form that the clover or other host-plant can feed on it. The\r\nclover and the bacteria live in Symbiosis, or in other words in a\r\nkind of mutual partnership. The host provides the bacteria with a\r\nhome and allows them to feed on the sugar and other food substances\r\nin its juices, and they in return manufacture nitrogen for the use of\r\nthe host. When the clover is cut for hay, its roots are left in the\r\nsoil, and in them is a large store of nitrogen derived from the air.\r\nA clover crop thus enriches the soil in nitrogen and is the best of\r\nall preparations for wheat-growing. After the clover, wheat was grown\r\nagain year after year until it once more became necessary to clean the\r\nland. This system of wheat-growing was carried on at Sawbridgeworth\r\nfor many years with commercial success. It never spread through the\r\ncountry because its success depends on the possibility of finding\r\na remunerative market for the straw. The bulk of straw is so great\r\ncompared with its price that it cannot profitably be carried to any\r\nconsiderable distance. The only market for straw in quantity is a\r\nlarge town, and there is no considerable area of land suitable for\r\nwheat-growing near a sufficiently large town to provide a market for\r\nthe large output of straw which would result from such a system of\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary practice of the British farmer is to grow his wheat in\r\nrotation with other crops. Various rotations are practised to suit the\r\nspecial circumstances of different districts, one might almost say of\r\nspecial farms. This short account of wheat-growing does not profess to\r\ngive a complete account of even English farming practice. It is only\r\nnecessary to describe here one rotation in order to give a general\r\nidea of the advantages of that form of husbandry. For this purpose\r\nit will suffice to describe the Norfolk or four course rotation. This\r\nrotation begins with a root crop, usually Swede turnips, manured with\r\nphosphates, and potash too on the lighter lands. This crop, as already\r\ndescribed, provides the opportunity of cleaning the land. It produces\r\nalso a large amount of food for sheep and cattle. Part of the roots are\r\nleft on the land where they are eaten by sheep during the winter. The\r\nroots alone are not suitable for a complete diet. They are supplemented\r\nby hay and by some kind of concentrated food rich in nitrogen, usually\r\nlinseed cake, the residue left when the oil is pressed from linseed.\r\nNow an animal only retains in its body about one-tenth of the nitrogen\r\nof its diet, so that nine-tenths of the nitrogen of the roots, hay\r\nand cake consumed by the sheep find their way back to the land. This\r\npractice of feeding sheep on the land therefore acts practically as\r\na liberal nitrogenous manuring. The trampling of the soil in a wet\r\ncondition in the winter also packs its particles closely together, and\r\nincreases its water-holding power, in much the same way as the special\r\ncultural methods employed in the arid western States under the name\r\nof dry farming. The rest of the roots are carted to the homestead for\r\nfeeding cattle, usually fattening cattle for beef. Again the roots are\r\nsupplemented by hay, straw, and cake of some kind rich in nitrogen.\r\nThe straw from former crops is used for litter. Its tubular structure\r\nenables it to soak up the excreta of the animals, so that the farmyard\r\nmanure thus produced retains a large proportion of the nitrogen, and\r\nother substances of manurial value, which the animals fail to retain in\r\ntheir bodies. This farmyard manure is kept for future use as will be\r\nseen later.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sheep have finished eating their share of the turnips\r\nthey are sold for mutton. It is now too late in the season to sow\r\nwheat. The land is ploughed, but the ploughing is only a shallow one,\r\nso that the water stored in the deeper layers of the soil which have\r\nbeen solidified by the trampling of the sheep may not be disturbed. The\r\nsurface soil turned up by the plough is pulverised by harrowing until\r\na fine seed-bed is obtained, and barley is sown early in the spring.\r\nClover and grass seeds are sown amongst the barley, so that they may\r\ntake firm root whilst the barley is growing and ripening. The barley\r\nis harvested in the autumn. The young clover and grasses establish\r\nthemselves during the autumn and winter, and produce a crop of hay the\r\nfollowing summer. This is harvested towards the end of June, and the\r\naftermath forms excellent autumn grazing for the sheep and cattle which\r\nare to be fed the next winter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as harvest is over the farmer hopes for rain to soften the\r\nold clover land, or olland as it is called in Norfolk, so that he can\r\nplough it for wheat sowing. Whilst he is waiting for rain he takes\r\nadvantage of the solidity of the soil, produced by the trampling of the\r\nstock, to cart on to the olland the farmyard manure produced during\r\nthe cattle feeding of the last winter. As soon as the rain comes this\r\nis ploughed in, and the seed-bed for the wheat prepared as quickly\r\nas possible. Wheat should be sown as soon as may be after the end of\r\nSeptember, so that the young plant may come up and establish itself,\r\nwhile the soil is yet warm from the summer sun, and before the winter\r\nfrosts set in. The wheat spends the winter in root development, and\r\ndoes not make much show above ground until the spring. It is harvested\r\nusually some time in August. The wheat stubble is ploughed in the\r\nautumn and again in the spring, and between then and June, when the\r\nroots are sown, it undergoes a thorough cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe complete rotation has now been described. It remains only to point\r\nout some of its numerous advantages. In the first place the system\r\ndescribed provides excellent conditions for growing both wheat and\r\nbarley in districts where the rainfall is inclined to be deficient,\r\nsay from 20 to 25 inches per annum, as it is in the eastern counties,\r\nand on the Yorkshire wolds. Not only is an abundant supply of nitrogen\r\nprovided for these crops through the medium of the cake purchased for\r\nthe stock, but the solidification of the deeper layers of the soil\r\nensures the retention of the winter’s rain for the use of the crop\r\nduring the dry summer. The residue of the phosphates and potash applied\r\nto the root crop, and left in the soil when that crop is removed,\r\nprovides for the mineral requirements of the barley and the wheat.\r\nThus each crop gets a direct application of the kind of manure it most\r\nneeds. Rotation husbandry also distributes the labour of the farm over\r\nthe year. After harvest the farmyard manure is carted on to the land.\r\nThis is followed by wheat sowing. In the winter there is the stock to\r\nbe fed. The spring brings barley sowing, the early summer the cleaning\r\nof the land for the roots. Then follow the hay harvest and the hoeing\r\nof the roots, and by this time corn-harvest comes round once again.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that each crop the farmer grows is subject to\r\nits own pests. On a four course rotation each crop comes on the same\r\nfield only once in four years. Whilst the field is under roots, barley,\r\nand clover, the wheat pests are more or less starved for want of food,\r\nand their virulence is thereby greatly diminished. The catalogue of\r\nthe advantages of rotation of crops is a long one but one more must be\r\nmentioned. The variety of products turned out for sale by the rotation\r\nfarmer ensures him against the danger which pursues the man who puts\r\nall his eggs in one basket. The four course farmer produces not only\r\nwheat and barley, but beef and mutton. The fluctuations in price of\r\nthese products tend to compensate each other. When corn is cheap,\r\nmeat may be dear, and vice versâ. Thus in the years about 1900, when\r\ncorn was making very low prices, sheep sold well, and the profit on\r\nsheep-feeding enabled many four course farmers to weather the bad times.\r\n\r\nThe system of wheat-growing above described is an intensive one.\r\nThe cultivation is thorough, the soil is kept in good condition by\r\nmanuring, or by the use of purchased feeding stuffs, and the cost of\r\nproduction is comparatively high. Such systems of intensive culture\r\nprevail in the more densely populated countries, but the bulk of the\r\nworld’s wheat supply is grown in thinly populated countries, where\r\nthe methods of cultivation are extensive. Wheat is sown year after\r\nyear on the same land, no manure is used, and tillage is reduced to a\r\nminimum. This style of cultivation gradually exhausts the fertility of\r\nthe richest virgin soil, and its cropping capacity falls off. As soon\r\nas the crop falls below a certain level it ceases to be profitable. No\r\ndoubt the fertility of the exhausted soil could be restored by suitable\r\ncultivation and manuring, but it is usually the custom to move towards\r\ndistricts which are still unsettled, and to take up more virgin soil.\r\nThus the centre of the area of wheat production in the States has moved\r\nnearly 700 miles westward in the last 50 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMARKETING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we have followed the growing of the wheat from\r\nseed time to harvest. But when the farmer has harvested his corn his\r\ntroubles are by no means over. He has still to thrash it, dress it,\r\nsell it, and deliver it to the mill or to the railway station. In the\r\ngood old times a hundred years ago thrashing was done by the flail,\r\nand found work during the winter for many skilled labourers. This\r\ntime-consuming method has long disappeared. In this country all the\r\ncorn is now thrashed by machines, driven as a rule by steam, but still\r\nin some places by horse-gearing. The thrashing machine, like all other\r\nlabour saving devices, when first introduced was bitterly opposed by\r\nthe labourers, who feared that they might lose their winter occupation\r\nand the wages it brought them. In the life of Coke of Norfolk, the\r\nfirst Lord Leicester, there is a graphic account of the riots which\r\ntook place when the first thrashing machine was brought into that\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nOnly the larger farmers possess their own machines. The thrashing on\r\nthe smaller farms is done by machines belonging to firms of engineers,\r\nwhich travel the country, each with its own team of men. These\r\nmachines will thrash out more than 100 bags of wheat or barley in a\r\nworking day. The more modern machines dress the corn so that it is\r\nready for sale without further treatment. After it is thrashed the\r\nwheat is carried in sacks into the barn and poured on to the barn\r\nfloor. It is next winnowed or dressed, again by a machine, which\r\nsubjects it to a process of sifting and blowing in order to remove\r\nchaff, weed-seeds and dirt. As it comes from the dressing machine it is\r\nmeasured into bags, each of which is weighed and made up to a standard\r\nweight ready for delivery. In the meantime the farmer has taken a\r\nsample of the wheat to market. The selling of wheat takes place on\r\nmarket day in the corn hall, or exchange, with which each market town\r\nof any importance is provided. In the hall each corn merchant in the\r\ndistrict rents a small table or desk, at which he stands during the\r\nhour of the market. The farmer takes his sample from one merchant to\r\nanother and sells it to the man who offers him the highest price. The\r\nmerchant keeps the sample and the farmer must deliver wheat of like\r\nquality. In the western counties it is sometimes customary for the\r\nfarmers to take their stand near their sample bags of corn whilst the\r\nmerchants walk round and make their bids.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately it too often happens that the struggling farmer\r\ncannot have a free hand in marketing his corn. In many cases he must\r\nsell at once after harvest to raise the necessary cash to buy stock\r\nfor the winter’s feeding. This causes a glut of wheat on the market\r\nin the early autumn, and the price at once drops. In other cases the\r\nfarmer has bought on credit last winter’s feeding stuffs, or last\r\nspring’s manures, and is bound to sell his wheat to the merchant in\r\nwhose debt he finds himself, and to take the best price offered in a\r\nnon-competitive market.\r\n\r\nThese are by no means all the handicaps of the farmer who would market\r\nhis corn to the best advantage. Even the man who is blessed with plenty\r\nof ready money, and can abide his own time for selling his wheat, is\r\nhampered by the cumbrous weights and measures in use in this country,\r\nand above all by their lack of uniformity. In East Anglia wheat is sold\r\nby the coomb of four bushels. By common acceptance however the coomb\r\nhas ceased to be four measured bushels, and is always taken to mean 18\r\nstones or 2¼ cwt. This custom is based on the fact that a bushel of\r\nwheat weighs on the average 63 pounds, and four times 63 pounds makes\r\n18 stones. But this custom is quite local. In other districts the unit\r\nof measure for the sale of wheat is the load, which in Yorkshire means\r\nthree bushels, in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire 40 bushels, and in\r\nparts of Lancashire 144 quarts. Another unit is the boll, which varies\r\nfrom three bushels in the Durham district to six bushels at Berwick.\r\nIt will be noted that most of the common units are multiples of the\r\nbushel, and it might be imagined that this would make their mutual\r\nrelations easy to calculate. This however is not so, for in some cases\r\nit is still customary to regard a bushel as a measure of volume and to\r\ndisregard the variation in weight. In other cases the bushel, as in\r\nEast Anglia, means so many pounds, but unfortunately not always the\r\nsame number. Thus the East Anglian bushel is 63 pounds, the London\r\nbushel on Mark Lane Market is the same, the Birmingham bushel is only\r\n62 pounds, the Liverpool and Manchester bushel 70 pounds, the Salop\r\nbushel 75 pounds, and in South Wales the bushel is 80 pounds. Finally,\r\nwheat is sold in Ireland by the barrel of 280 pounds, on Mark Lane by\r\nthe quarter of eight bushels of 63 pounds, imported wheat in Liverpool\r\nand Manchester by the cental of 100 pounds, and the official market\r\nreturns issued by the Board of Agriculture are made in bushels of 60\r\npounds. There is, however, a growing tendency to adopt throughout the\r\ncountry the 63 pound bushel or some multiple thereof, for example the\r\ncoomb or quarter, as the general unit, and the use of the old-fashioned\r\nmeasures is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe farmer of course knows the weights and measures in use in his own\r\nand neighbouring markets, but unless he takes the trouble to look\r\nup in a book of reference the unit by which wheat is sold at other\r\nmarkets, and to make a calculation from that unit into the unit in\r\nwhich he is accustomed to sell, the market quotations in the newspapers\r\nare of little use to him in enabling him to follow the fluctuations\r\nof the price of wheat. Thus a Norfolk farmer who wishes to interpret\r\nthe information that the price of the grade of wheat known as No. 4\r\nManitoba on the Liverpool market is 7/3½, must first ascertain that\r\nwheat is sold at Liverpool by the cental of 100 pounds. To convert\r\nthe Liverpool price into price per coomb, the unit in which he is\r\naccustomed to sell, he must multiply the price per cental by 252, the\r\nnumber of pounds in a coomb of wheat, and divide the result by 100, the\r\nnumber of pounds in a cental; thus:\r\n\r\n  7/3½ x 252 ÷ 100 = 18/4½.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the farmer who wishes to follow wheat prices in\r\norder to catch the best market for his wheat, must acquaint himself\r\nwith an extremely complicated system of weights and measures, and\r\ncontinually make troublesome calculations. The average English farmer\r\nis an excellent craftsman. He is unsurpassed, indeed one may safely say\r\nunequalled, as a cultivator of the land, as a grower of crops, and as\r\na breeder and feeder of stock, but like most people who lead open-air\r\nlives, he is not addicted to spending his evenings in arithmetical\r\ncalculations. The corn merchant, whose business it is to attend to\r\nsuch matters, is therefore at a distinct advantage, and the farmer\r\nloses the benefit of a rise in the market until the information slowly\r\nfilters through to him. No doubt the time will come, when not only\r\nwheat selling, but all business in this country, will be simplified by\r\nthe compulsory enactment of sale by uniform weight. The change from\r\nthe present haphazard system or want of system would no doubt cause\r\nconsiderable temporary dislocation of business, and would abolish many\r\nancient weights and measures, interesting to the historian and the\r\narchaeologist in their relations to ancient customs, but in the long\r\nrun it could not but expedite business, and remove one of the many\r\nhandicaps attaching to the isolated position of the farmer.\r\n\r\nHaving sold his wheat the farmer now puts it up in sacks of the\r\nstandard of weight or measure prevailing in his district. If the\r\nmerchant who bought it happens to be also a miller, as is frequently\r\nthe case, the wheat is delivered to the mill. Otherwise it is sent\r\nto the railway station to the order of the merchant who bought\r\nit. Meantime the merchant has probably sold it to a miller in a\r\nneighbouring large town, to whom he directs the railway company to\r\nforward it. Thus the wheat directly or indirectly finds its way to a\r\nmill, where it will be mixed with other wheats and ground into flour.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed wheat production in England from the ground to\r\nthe mill. But at the present time home grown wheat can provide only\r\nabout one-fifth of the bread-stuffs consumed by the population of\r\nthe United Kingdom, and any account of the growing of wheat cannot\r\nbe complete without some mention of the methods employed in other\r\ncountries. The extensive methods of wheat-growing in the more thinly\r\npopulated countries have already been shortly mentioned. But though\r\ntheir methods of production are of the simplest, the arrangements for\r\nmarketing their produce are far more advanced in organisation than\r\nthose already described for the marketing of home grown produce.\r\n\r\nFor thrashing in Canada and the Western States, travelling machines\r\nare commonly used, but they are larger than the machines in use in\r\nthis country, and the men who travel with them work harder and for\r\nlonger hours. It is usual for a Canadian travelling “outfit” to thrash\r\n1000 bags of wheat in a day, about ten times as much as is considered\r\na day’s thrashing in England. Harvesting and thrashing machinery has\r\nevolved to an extraordinary extent in the West on labour saving lines.\r\nOn the Bonanza farms of the Western States machines are in use which\r\ncut off the heads of the wheat, thrash out the seed, and bag it ready\r\nfor delivery, as they travel round and round the field. Such machines\r\nof course leave the straw standing where it grew, and there it is\r\nsubsequently burnt. Since wheat is grown every year, few animals are\r\nkept beyond the working horses. Very little straw suffices for them and\r\nthe rest has no value since its great bulk prohibits its profitable\r\ncarriage to a distance.\r\n\r\nAfter being thrashed the grain is delivered, usually in very large\r\nloads drawn by large teams of horses, to the nearest railway station,\r\nwhence it is despatched to the nearest centre where there is a grain\r\nstore, or elevator as it is called. Here it is sampled by inspectors\r\nunder the control, either of the Government or the Board of Trade, as\r\nthe committee is called which manages the wheat exchange at Chicago\r\nor other of the great wheat trading centres. The inspectors examine\r\nthe sample, and on the result of their examination, assign the wheat\r\nto one or other of a definite series of grades. These grades are\r\naccurately defined by general agreement of the Board of Trade or by\r\nthe Government. Each delivery of wheat is kept separate for a certain\r\nnumber of days after it has been graded, in case the owner wishes to\r\nappeal against the verdict of the inspector. Such appeals are allowed\r\non the owner forfeiting one dollar per car load of grain if the verdict\r\nof the inspector is found to have been correct. At the Chicago wheat\r\nexchange 27 grades of wheat are recognised. The following examples show\r\nthe methods by which they are defined. The definitions are the subject\r\nof frequent controversy.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Northern Hard Spring Wheat shall be sound, bright, sweet, clean,\r\nand shall consist of over 50 per cent. of hard Scotch Fife, and weigh\r\nnot less than 58 pounds to the measured bushel.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Northern Spring Wheat shall be sound, sweet and clean; may\r\nconsist of hard and soft varieties of spring wheat, but must contain\r\na larger proportion of the hard varieties, and weigh not less than 57\r\npounds to the measured bushel.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 Northern Spring Wheat shall be spring wheat not clean enough or\r\nsound enough for No. 1, but of good milling quality, and must not weigh\r\nless than 56 pounds to the measured bushel.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 Northern Spring Wheat shall be composed of inferior shrunken\r\nspring wheat, and weigh not less than 54 pounds to the measured bushel.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 Northern Spring Wheat shall include all inferior spring wheat\r\nthat is badly shrunken or damaged, and shall weigh not less than 49\r\npounds to the measured bushel.\r\n\r\nWhen sampling wheat for grading, the inspectors also estimate the\r\nnumber of pounds of impurities per bushel, a deduction for which is\r\nmade under the name of dockage. At the same time the weight of wheat in\r\neach car is officially determined. All these points, grade, dockage,\r\nand weight, are officially registered, and as soon as the time has\r\nelapsed for dealing with any appeal which may arise, the wheat is\r\nmixed with all the other wheats of the same grade which may be at\r\nthe depot, an official receipt for so many bushels of such and such a\r\ngrade of wheat subject to so much dockage being given to the seller or\r\nhis agent. These official receipts are as good as cash, and the farmer\r\ncan realise cash on them at once by paying them into his bank, without\r\nwaiting for the wheat to be sold.\r\n\r\nAs each delivery of wheat is graded and weighed, word is sent to\r\nthe central wheat exchanges that so many bushels of such and such\r\ngrades are at the elevator, and official samples are also sent on\r\nat the same time. The bulk of the sales however are made by grade\r\nand not by sample. The actual buying and selling takes place in the\r\nwheat exchanges, or wheat pits as they are called, at Chicago, New\r\nYork, Minneapolis, Duluth, Kansas City, St Louis, and Winnipeg, each\r\nof which markets possesses its own special character. Chicago the\r\ngreatest of the wheat markets of the world passes through its hands\r\nevery year about 25 million bushels of wheat, chiefly from the western\r\nand south-western States. It owes its preeminence to the converging\r\nrailway lines from those States, and to its proximity to Lake Michigan\r\nwhich puts it in touch with water carriage. New York has grown in\r\nimportance as a wheat market since the opening of the Erie Canal. It\r\nis especially the market for export. Minneapolis is above all things\r\na milling centre. No doubt it has become so partly on account of the\r\nimmense water-power provided by the Falls of St Antony. It receives\r\nannually nearly 100 million bushels of wheat, its speciality being the\r\nvarious grades of hard spring wheat. Duluth is the most northern of the\r\nAmerican wheat markets. It receives and stores over 50 million bushels\r\nannually. It owes its importance to its position on Lake Superior,\r\nwhich is available for water carriage. Kansas City deals with over 40\r\nmillion bushels per annum, largely hard winter wheat, which it ships\r\ndown the Missouri River. St Louis deals in soft winter wheats to the\r\nextent of about 20 million bushels per annum. Winnipeg is the market\r\nfor Canadian wheats, to the extent of over 50 million bushels per\r\nannum. It has the advantage of two navigable rivers, the Red River and\r\nthe Assiniboine, and it is also a great railway centre. Its importance\r\nis increasing as the centre of the wheat-growing area moves to the\r\nnorth and west, and it is rapidly taking the leading position in the\r\nwheat markets of the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated above that Chicago is the greatest wheat market,\r\nbut it will no doubt have been noticed that this is not borne out by\r\nthe figures which have been quoted. For instance, Minneapolis receives\r\nevery year nearly four times as much wheat as Chicago. The reason of\r\nthis apparent discrepancy is that the sales at Minneapolis are really\r\n_bona fide_ sales of actual wheat for milling, whilst nine-tenths\r\nof the sales at Chicago are not sales of actual wheat, but of what\r\nare known as “futures.” On this assumption, whilst the actual wheat\r\nreceived at Chicago is 25 million bushels, the sales amount to 250\r\nmillion bushels. Such dealing in futures takes place to a greater or\r\nless extent at all the great wheat markets, but more at Chicago than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for dealing in futures is that the merchant who\r\nbuys a large quantity of wheat, which he intends to sell again at some\r\nfuture time, may be able to insure himself against loss by a fall\r\nin price whilst he is holding the wheat he has bought. This he does\r\nby selling to a speculative buyer an equal quantity of wheat to be\r\ndelivered at some future time. If whilst he is holding his wheat prices\r\ndecline, he will then be able to recoup his loss on the wheat by buying\r\non the market at the reduced price now current to meet his contract\r\nwith the speculative buyer, and the profit he makes on this transaction\r\nwill more or less cover his loss on the actual deal in wheat which\r\nhe has in progress. As a matter of fact he does not actually deliver\r\nthe wheat sold to the speculative buyer. The transaction is usually\r\ncompleted by the speculator paying to the merchant the difference in\r\nvalue between the price at which the wheat was sold and the price to\r\nwhich it has fallen in the interval. This payment is insured by the\r\nspeculative buyer depositing a margin of so many cents per bushel at\r\nthe time when the transaction was made. Speculation is, however, kept\r\nwithin reasonable bounds by the fact that a seller may always be called\r\nupon to deliver wheat instead of paying differences.\r\n\r\nThe advantage claimed for this system of insurance is that whilst\r\nit is not more costly to the dealers in actual wheat than any other\r\nequally efficient method, it supports a number of speculative buyers\r\nand sellers, whose business it is to keep themselves in touch with\r\nevery phase of the world’s wheat supply. The presence of such a body of\r\nmen whose wits are trained by experience of market movements, and who\r\nare ready at any moment to back their judgment by buying and selling\r\nlarge quantities of wheat for future delivery, is considered to exert\r\na steadying effect on the price of wheat, and to lessen the extent of\r\nfluctuations in the price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing the quality of wheat it is necessary to adopt two\r\ndistinct points of view, that of the farmer and that of the miller. A\r\ngood wheat from the farmer’s point, of view is one that will year by\r\nyear give him a good monetary return per acre. Now the monetary return\r\nobviously depends on two factors, the yield per acre and the value per\r\nquarter, coomb, or bushel, as the case may be. These two factors are\r\nquite independent and must be discussed separately.\r\n\r\nWe will first confine our attention to the yield per acre. This has\r\nalready been shown to depend on the presence in the soil of plenty of\r\nthe various elements required by plants, in the case of wheat nitrogen\r\nbeing especially important. The need of suitable soil and proper\r\ncultivation has also been emphasised. These conditions are to a great\r\nextent under the control of the farmer, whose fault it is if they\r\nare not efficiently arranged. But there are other factors affecting\r\nthe yield of wheat which cannot be controlled, such for instance as\r\nsunshine and rainfall. The variations in these conditions from year to\r\nyear are little understood, but they are now the subject of accurate\r\nstudy, and already Dr W. N. Shaw, the chief of the Meteorological\r\nOffice has suggested a periodicity in the yield of wheat, connected\r\nwith certain climatic conditions, notably the autumnal rainfall.\r\n\r\nWe have left to the last one of the most important factors which\r\ndetermine the yield of wheat, namely, the choice of the particular\r\nvariety which is sown. This is undoubtedly one of the most important\r\npoints in wheat-growing which the farmer has to decide for himself.\r\nThe British farmer has no equal as a producer of high class stock. He\r\nsupplies pedigree animals of all kinds to the farmers of all other\r\nlands, and he has attained this preeminence by careful attention to\r\nthe great, indeed the surpassing, importance of purity of breed. It\r\nis only in recent years that the idea has dawned on the agricultural\r\ncommunity that breed is just as important in plants as in animals. It\r\nis extraordinary that such an obvious fact should have been ignored\r\nfor so long. That it now occupies so prominently the attention of the\r\nfarmers is due to the work of the agricultural colleges and experiment\r\nstations in Sweden, America, and many other countries, and last but\r\nby no means least in Great Britain. This demonstration of the value\r\nof plant breeding is perhaps the greatest achievement in the domain\r\nof agricultural science since the publication of Lawes and Gilbert’s\r\nclassical papers on the manurial requirements of crops.\r\n\r\nWheat is not only one of the most adaptable of plants. It is also one\r\nof the most plastic and prone to variation. During the many centuries\r\nover which its cultivation has extended it has yielded hundreds of\r\ndifferent varieties, whose origin, however, except in a few doubtful\r\ncases is unknown. Comparatively few of these varieties are in common\r\nuse in this country, and even of these it was impossible until recently\r\nto say which was the best. It was even almost impossible to obtain\r\na pure stock of many of the standard varieties. This is by no means\r\nthe simple matter it appears to be. It is of course quite easy to pick\r\nout a single ear, to rub out the grain from it, to sow the grain on a\r\nsmall plot by itself and to raise a pound or so of perfectly pure seed.\r\nThis can again be sown by itself, and the produce, thrashed by hand,\r\nwill give perhaps a bushel of seed which will be quite pure. From this\r\nseed it will be possible to sow something like an acre; and now the\r\ntrouble begins. Any kind of hand thrashing is extremely tedious for the\r\nproduce of acre plots, and thrashing by machinery becomes imperative.\r\nNow a thrashing machine is an extremely complicated piece of apparatus,\r\nwhich it is practically impossible thoroughly to clean. When once seed\r\nhas been through such a machine it is impossible to guarantee its\r\npurity. Contamination in the thrashing machine is usually the cause of\r\nthe impurity of the stocks of wheat and other cereals throughout the\r\ncountry. The only remedy is for the farmer to renew his stock from time\r\nto time from one or other of the seedsmen or institutions who make it\r\ntheir business to keep on hand pure stocks obtained by the method above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Typical ears of a few of the many cultivated\r\nvarieties of wheat]\r\n\r\nComparative trials of pure stocks of many of the standard varieties\r\nof wheat, and of the other cereals, are being carried out in almost\r\nevery county by members of the staff of the agricultural colleges.\r\nThe object of such trials is to determine the relative cropping power\r\nof the different varieties. This might at first sight appear to be\r\nan extremely simple matter, but a moment’s consideration shows that\r\nthis is not the case. No soil is so uniform that an experimenter can\r\nguarantee that each of the varieties he is trying has the same chance\r\nof making a good yield as far as soil is concerned. It is a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge too that every crop of wheat is more or less affected\r\nby insect and fungoid pests, whose injuries are unlikely to fall\r\nequally on each of the varieties in any variety test. Many other causes\r\nof variation, such as unequal distribution of manure, inequalities in\r\nprevious cropping of the land, irregular damage by birds, may well\r\ninterfere with the reliability of such field tests.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to this subject during the last few\r\nyears, and it has been shown that as often as not two plots of the\r\nsame variety of wheat grown in the same field under conditions which\r\nare made as uniform as possible will differ in yield by 5 per cent. or\r\nmore. Obviously it is impossible to make comparisons of the cropping\r\npower of different varieties of wheat as the result of trials in\r\nwhich single plots of each variety are grown. It is a deplorable fact\r\nhowever that the results of most of the trials which are published are\r\nbased on single plots only of the varieties compared. Such results\r\ncan have no claim to reliability. Single plots tests are excellent\r\nas local demonstrations, to give the farmers a chance of seeing the\r\ngeneral characters of the various wheats in the field, but for the\r\ndetermination of cropping power their results are misleading. For\r\nthe comparison of two varieties however an accuracy of about 1 per\r\ncent., which is good enough for the purpose in view, can be obtained\r\nby growing, harvesting and weighing separately, five separate plots of\r\neach variety under experiment, provided the plots are distributed in\r\npairs over the experimental field.\r\n\r\nStill greater accuracy can be attained by growing very large numbers\r\nof very small plots of each variety in a bird-proof enclosure. The\r\nillustration shows such an enclosure at Cambridge where five varieties\r\nwere tested, each on 40 plots. Each plot was one square yard, and the\r\nwhole 200 plots occupied so small an area that uniformity of soil could\r\nbe secured by hand culture.\r\n\r\nSeveral experimenters are now at work on these lines, and it is to be\r\nhoped that all who wish to carry out variety tests will either follow\r\nsuit, or content themselves with using their single plots only for\r\ndemonstrating the general characters of the varieties in the field.\r\n\r\nSo far we have confined our discussion to the standard varieties, and\r\nwe must now turn our attention to the work which has been done in\r\nrecent years on the breeding of new varieties which will yield heavier\r\ncrops than any of the varieties hitherto in cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Part of bird-proof enclosure containing many\r\nsmall plots for variety testing]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give more than a very brief outline of the vast\r\namount of work which has been done on this subject. Broadly speaking,\r\ntwo methods have been used, selection and hybridisation. Of these\r\nselection is the simpler, but even selection is by no means the simple\r\nmatter it might appear to be. Let us examine for a moment the various\r\ncharacters of a single wheat plant which determine its capacity for\r\nyielding grain. The average weight of one grain, the number of grains\r\nin an ear, the number of ears on the plant, are obviously all of them\r\ncharacters which will influence the weight of grain yielded by the\r\nplant. Many experimenters have examined thousands of plants for these\r\ncharacters, often by means of extremely ingenious mechanical sorting\r\ninstruments, and have raised strains of seed from the plants showing\r\none or more of these characters in the highest degree. The results of\r\nthis method of selection have as a rule been unsuccessful, no doubt\r\nbecause the size of the grain, the number of grains in the ear, and\r\nthe number of ears on the plant, are so largely determined by the food\r\nsupply, or by some other cause quite outside the plant itself. They are\r\nin fact in most cases acquired characters, and are not inherited. This\r\nmethod of selection results in picking out rather the well nourished\r\nplant than the well bred one. Again it is obvious that the weight of\r\ngrain per acre is measured by the weight of one grain, multiplied by\r\nthe number of grains per ear, multiplied by the number of ears per\r\nplant, multiplied by the number of plants per acre. Selecting for any\r\none of these characters, say large ears, is quite likely to diminish\r\nother equally important characters, say number of ears per plant.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid these difficulties the method of selection according\r\nto progeny has been devised. The essence of this method is to select\r\nfor stock, not the best individual plant, but the plant whose progeny\r\nyields the greatest weight of seed per unit area. This method was\r\napplied with great industry and some success in the Minnesota wheat\r\nbreeding experiments of Willett Hays. Large numbers of promising plants\r\nwere collected from a plot of the best variety in that district. The\r\nseed from each plant was rubbed out and sown separately. One hundred\r\nseeds from each plant were sown on small separate plots which were\r\ncarefully marked out and labelled. Every possible precaution was taken\r\nto make all the little plots uniform in every way. By harvesting each\r\nplot separately, and weighing the grain it produced, it was possible to\r\nfind out which of the original plants had given the largest yield. This\r\nprocess was repeated by sowing again on separate plots a hundred seeds\r\nfrom each individual plant from the best plot, and again weighing the\r\nproduce of each plot. After several repetitions it was stated that new\r\nstrains were obtained which yielded considerably greater crops than the\r\nvariety from which they were originally selected. These results were\r\npublished in 1895, but no definite statements have since appeared as to\r\nthe success ultimately attained.\r\n\r\nThis method of selection is undoubtedly more likely to give successful\r\nresults than the method which depends on the selection of plants for\r\ntheir apparent good qualities; but it has several weak points. In\r\nthe first place it is almost impossible to make the soil of a large\r\nnumber of plots so uniform that variation in yield due to varying soil\r\nconditions will not mask the variations due to the different cropping\r\npower of the seed of the separate plants. Many experimenters are still\r\nat work with a view to overcome this difficulty. Secondly, plant\r\nbreeders are by no means agreed on the exact theoretical meaning of\r\nimprovement by selection. The balance of evidence at the present time\r\nseems to tend towards the general adoption of what is known as the\r\npure-line theory. According to this theory, which was first enunciated\r\nby Johannsen of Copenhagen as the outcome of a lengthy series of\r\nexperiments with beans, the general population of plants, in say a\r\nfield of wheat of one of the standard varieties giving an average\r\nyield of say 40 bushels per acre, consists of a very large number of\r\nraces each varying in yielding capacity from say 30 to 50 bushels per\r\nacre. These races can be separated by collecting a very large number\r\nof separate plants, sowing say 100 seeds from each on a separate plot,\r\nand weighing the produce separately. The crop on each plot, being the\r\nproduce of a separate plant, will be a distinct race, or pure line\r\nas it is called, and each pure line will possess a definite yielding\r\npower of its own. If this is so the difficulty of soil variation can be\r\novercome by saving seed from many of the best plots, and sowing it on\r\nseveral separate plots. At harvest time these are gathered separately\r\nand weighed. By averaging the weights of grain from many separate plots\r\nscattered over the experimental area the effect of soil variation can\r\nbe eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe method is very laborious, but seems to promise successful results.\r\nFor instance, Beaven of Warminster, working on these lines, has\r\nsucceeded in isolating a pure line of Archer barley which is a distinct\r\nadvance on the ordinary stocks of that variety. There appears to be\r\nno reason why it should not be applied to wheat with equal success;\r\nin fact, Percival of Reading states that his selected Blue Cone wheat\r\nwas produced in this way. The essence, of the method is that if the\r\npure-line theory holds there is no necessity to continue selecting\r\nthe best individual plant from each plot, for each plot being the\r\nproduce of a single plant must be a pure line with its own definite\r\ncharacters. The whole of the seed from a number of the best plots can\r\ntherefore be saved. The seed from each of these good plots can be used\r\nto sow many separate plots: by averaging the yields from these plots\r\nthe effects of soil variation can be eliminated, and the cropping\r\npower thus determined with great accuracy. It is thus possible to\r\npick out the best pure line with far greater certainty than in any\r\nother way. It must not be forgotten, however, that the success of the\r\nmethod depends on the truth of the pure-line theory. It should also\r\nbe pointed out that the cereals are all self-fertilised plants. When\r\nworking on these lines with plants which are readily cross-fertilised,\r\nsuch for instance as turnips or mangels, it is necessary to enclose the\r\noriginal individual plants, and the subsequent separate plots, so as to\r\nprevent them from crossing with plants of other lines, in which case\r\nthe progeny would be cross-bred and not the progeny of a single plant.\r\nThis of course enormously increases the difficulty of carrying out the\r\nexperiment. Enough has been said to show that the task of improving\r\nplants by systematic selection is an extremely tedious and difficult\r\none. Of course anyone may be fortunate enough to drop on a valuable\r\nsport when carefully inspecting his crops, and it appears likely that\r\nmany of the most valuable varieties in cultivation have originated from\r\nlucky chances of this kind.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the dream of the plant breeder to make use of the\r\nprocess of hybridisation for creating new varieties, but until the\r\nwork of Mendel threw new light on the subject the odds were against\r\nthe success of the breeder. The idea of the older hybridisers was that\r\ncrossing two dissimilar varieties broke the type and gave rise to\r\ngreatly increased variation. From the very diverse progeny resulting\r\nfrom the cross, likely individuals were picked out. Seed was saved from\r\nthese and sown on separate plots, and attempts were made to obtain a\r\nfixed type by destroying, or roguing as it is called, all the plants\r\nwhich departed from the desired type. This was a tedious process which\r\nseldom resulted in success. Mendel’s discoveries, made originally\r\nnearly 50 years ago, as the result of experiments in the garden of\r\nhis monastery, in the crossing of different varieties of garden peas,\r\nremained unknown until rediscovered in 1899. In the 12 years which\r\nhave elapsed since that date the results which have been achieved show\r\nclearly that the application of Mendelian methods is likely greatly\r\nto increase the simplicity and the certainty of plant improvement by\r\nhybridisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. A wheat flower with the chaff opened to show the\r\nstamens and the stigmas]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way of describing the bearing of Mendel’s Laws on the\r\nimprovement of wheat is to give an illustration from the work carried\r\nout by Biffen at Cambridge, dealing at first with simple characters\r\nobvious to anyone. In one of his first experiments two varieties of\r\nwheat were crossed with each other. The one variety possessed long\r\nloose beardless ears, the other short dense bearded ears. The crossing\r\nwas performed early in June, sometime before what the farmer calls\r\nflowering time. The flowering of wheat as understood by the farmer\r\nis the escape of the stamens from the flower. Fertilisation always\r\ntakes place before this, and crossing must be done of course before\r\nself-fertilisation has been effected. The actual crossing is done\r\nthus: An ear of one of the varieties having been chosen, one of the\r\nflowers is exposed by opening the chaff which encloses it (Fig. 3),\r\nthe stamens are removed by forceps, and a stamen from a flower of the\r\nother variety is inserted, care being taken that it bursts so that\r\nthe pollen may touch the feathery stigmas. The chaff is then pushed\r\nback so that it may protect the flower from injury. The pollen grains\r\ngrow on the stigmas, and penetrate down the styles into the ovary. In\r\nthis way cross-fertilisation is effected. It is usual to operate on\r\nseveral flowers on an ear in this way, and to remove the other flowers,\r\nso that no mistake may be made as to which seed is the result of the\r\ncross. Immediately after the operation the ear is usually tied up in\r\na waxed paper bag. This serves to make it absolutely certain that\r\nno other pollen can get access to the stigmas except that which was\r\nplaced there. At the same time it is a convenient way of marking the\r\near which was experimented upon. The cross is usually made both ways,\r\neach variety being used both as pollen parent and as ovary parent.\r\nAs soon as the cross-fertilised seeds are ripe they are gathered, and\r\nearly in the autumn they are sown. It is almost necessary to sow them\r\nand other small quantities of seed wheat in an enclosure protected by\r\nwire netting. Otherwise they are very liable to suffer great damage\r\nfrom sparrows. The plants which grow from the cross-fertilised seeds\r\nare known as the first generation. In the case under consideration,\r\nthey were found to produce ears of medium length and denseness,\r\nintermediate between the ears of the two parent varieties, and to be\r\nbeardless. The first generation plants were also characterised by\r\nextraordinary vigour, as is the case with almost all first crosses,\r\nboth in plants and animals. Their seed was saved and sown on a small\r\nplot, and produced some hundreds of plants of the second generation.\r\nOn examining these second generation plants it was found that the\r\ncharacters of the parent varieties had rearranged themselves in every\r\npossible combination, long ears with and without beard, short ears with\r\nand without beard, intermediate ears with and without beard, as shown\r\nin Fig. 4. These different types were sorted out and counted, when they\r\nwere found to be present in perfectly definite proportions. This is\r\nbest shown in the form of a tabulated statement, thus:\r\n\r\n    Ears      Ears      Ears      Ears      Ears      Ears\r\n    Long      Long     Medium    Medium     Short     Short\r\n  Beardless  Bearded  Beardless  Bearded  Beardless  Bearded\r\n      3         1         6         2         3         1\r\n\r\nTranslating this into words, out of every 16 plants in the second\r\ngeneration there were four long eared plants, three beardless and one\r\nbearded; eight plants with ears of intermediate length, six beardless\r\nand two bearded; and four short eared plants, three beardless and one\r\nbearded. The illustration shows all these types. The experiment has\r\nbeen repeated several times and the same proportions were invariably\r\nobtained. The result, too, was independent of the way the cross was\r\nmade. Seed was collected separately from large numbers of single\r\nplants of each type. The seed from each plant was sown by itself\r\nin a row, so that its progeny could be separately observed. It was\r\nfound that all the plants of the second generation possessing ears of\r\nintermediate length produced in the third generation plants with long\r\nears, short ears, and medium ears in the proportion of 1 : 1 : 2, the\r\nsame proportion in fact as in the second generation. Short eared plants\r\nproduced only short eared offspring, long eared plants only long eared\r\noffspring. Bearded plants produced only bearded offspring. Beardless\r\nplants, however, produced in some cases only beardless offspring, in\r\nother cases both beardless and bearded offspring in the proportion of\r\nthree of the former to one of the latter. Out of every three beardless\r\nplants only one was found to breed true, whilst two gave a mixed\r\nprogeny. It appears therefore that in the second generation some of the\r\ntypes which occur breed true, whilst others do not. Some of the true\r\nbreeding individuals can be picked out at sight, for instance, those\r\nwith long or short bearded ears. Some of those which will not breed\r\ntrue can also be recognised by inspection, for instance, all the plants\r\nwith ears of intermediate length. In other cases it is only possible to\r\npick out the individual plants which breed true by growing their seed\r\nand observing how it behaves. If it produces progeny all of which are\r\nlike the plant from which the seed was obtained, that plant is a fixed\r\ntype and will breed true continuously in the future. The final result\r\nof the experiment was to obtain in three years from the time the cross\r\nwas made, four fixed types which subsequent experience has shown breed\r\ntrue continuously, a long eared bearded type, a short eared beardless\r\ntype, a long eared beardless type and a short eared bearded type. Of\r\nthese the second two are exactly like the two parental varieties, but\r\nthe first two are new, each combining one character from each parent.\r\nThese fixed types already existed in the second generation. Mendel’s\r\ndiscoveries with peas showed how to pick them out. Obviously there is\r\nno need for the years of roguing by which the older hybridisers used\r\nto attempt to fix their desired type. All the types are present in the\r\nsecond generation. Mendel has shown how the fixed ones may be picked\r\nout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. _P_, _P_, the two parental types. _F₁_ the first\r\ncross. _F₂_, 1-6, the types found in the second generation]\r\n\r\nThe characters described above are not of any great economic\r\nimportance. Biffen has shown that such important characters as\r\nbaking strength and resistance to the disease known as yellow rust\r\nbehave on crossing in the same way as beard. Working on the lines of\r\nthe experiment described above he has succeeded in producing several\r\nnew varieties which in baking strength and in rust resistance are a\r\ndistinct advance on any varieties in cultivation in this country.\r\nHis method of working was to collect wheats from every part of the\r\nworld, to sow them and to pick out from the crop, which was usually\r\na mixed one, all the pure types he could. These were grown on small\r\nplots for several years under close observation. Many were found to\r\nbe worthless and were soon discarded. Others were observed to possess\r\nsome one valuable character. Amongst these a pure strain of Red Fife\r\nwas obtained from Canadian seed, which was found to retain when grown\r\nin England the excellent baking strength of the hard wheats of Canada\r\nand North America. Again, other varieties were noticed to remain free\r\nfrom yellow rust year after year, even when varieties on adjoining\r\nplots were so badly infected that they failed to produce seed. Other\r\nvarieties, too, were preserved for the sturdiness of their straw,\r\ntheir earliness in ripening, vigour of growth, or yielding capacity.\r\nMany crosses were made with these as parents. The illustration shows\r\na corner of the Cambridge wheat-breeding enclosure including a\r\nmiscellaneous collection of parent varieties. The paper bags on the\r\nears show where crosses have been made. From the second generation\r\nnumbers of individual plants possessing desirable characters were\r\npicked out, and the fixed types isolated in the third generation by\r\nmaking cultures from the seed of these single plants. The seed from\r\nthese fixed types was sown on small field plots, at which stage many\r\nhad to be rejected because they were found wanting in some character\r\nof great practical importance which did not make itself evident in\r\nthe breeding enclosure. The illustration shows a case in point. It\r\nwas photographed after heavy rain in July. The weakness of the straw\r\nof the variety on the left had not been noticed in the enclosure. The\r\ntypes which approved themselves on the small field plots were again\r\ngrown on larger plots so that their yield and milling and baking\r\ncharacters could be tested. So far two types have survived the ordeal.\r\nOne combines the cropping power of the best English varieties with the\r\nbaking strength of North American hard wheat. It is the outcome of a\r\ncross between Rough Chaff and Red Fife. Its average crop in 1911 was 38\r\nbushels per acre as the result of 28 independent trials, and, where the\r\nlocal millers have found out its quality, it makes on the market four\r\nor five shillings per quarter more than the ordinary English varieties.\r\nThe other resulted from a cross between Square Head’s Master and\r\na rust-resisting type isolated from a graded Russian wheat called\r\nGhirka. It is practically rust-proof. Consequently it yields a heavier\r\ncrop than any of the ordinary varieties which are all more or less\r\nsusceptible to rust. The presence of rust in and on the leaves hinders\r\nthe growth of the plant, lowers the yield, and increases the proportion\r\nof shrivelled grains. It has been estimated that rust diminishes the\r\nworld’s wheat crop by something like one third. The new rust-proof\r\nvariety gave an average yield of about 6 bushels per acre more than\r\nordinary varieties on the average of 28 trials last year. It is called\r\nLittle Joss and is especially valuable in the Fens and other districts\r\nwhere rust is more than usually virulent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Corner of bird-proof enclosure showing a varied\r\nassortment of parent varieties of wheat. Crosses have been made on some\r\nof them as shown by the ears tied up in paper bags]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 6. Field plots of two new varieties of the same parentage\r\n    which had approved themselves in the bird-proof enclosure. That\r\n    on the left had to be rejected on account of the weakness of\r\n    its straw. That on the right is the rust-proof variety known as\r\n    Little Joss. The photograph was taken after a storm which in\r\n    the open field found out the weak point of the one variety]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE QUALITY OF WHEAT FROM THE MILLER’S POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the miller the quality of wheat depends on three chief factors, the\r\npercentage of dirt, weed seeds, and other impurities, the percentage of\r\nwater in the sample, and a complex and somewhat ill-defined character\r\ncommonly called strength.\r\n\r\nWith the methods of growing, cleaning and thrashing wheat practised in\r\nGreat Britain, practically clean samples are produced, and home grown\r\nwheat is therefore on the whole fairly free from impurities. This is,\r\nhowever, far from the case with foreign wheats, many of which arrive at\r\nthe English ports in an extremely dirty condition. They are purchased\r\nby millers subject to a deduction from the price for impurities above\r\nthe standard percentage which is allowed. The purchase is usually made\r\nbefore the cargo is unloaded. Official samples are taken during the\r\nunloading in which the percentage of impurities is determined, and the\r\ndeduction, if any, estimated.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of water, the natural moisture as it is usually called,\r\nvaries greatly in the wheats of different countries. In home grown\r\nwheats it is usually 16 per cent., but in very dry seasons it may be\r\nmuch lower, and in wet seasons it may rise to 18 per cent. Foreign\r\nwheats are usually considerably drier than home grown wheats. In\r\nRussian wheats 12 per cent. is about the average, and that too is about\r\nthe figure for many of the wheats from Canada, the States, Argentina,\r\nand parts of Australia. Indian wheats sometimes contain less than 10\r\nper cent. This is also about the percentage in the wheats of the arid\r\nlands on the Pacific coast and in Australia. These figures show that\r\nhome grown wheats often contain as much as 5 per cent. more water\r\nthan the foreign wheats imported from the more arid countries. The\r\nmore water a wheat contains the less flour it will yield in the mill.\r\nConsequently the less its value to the miller. A difference of 5 per\r\ncent. of natural moisture means a difference in price of from 1_s._\r\n6_d._ to 2_s._ per quarter in favour of the drier foreign wheats. This\r\nis one of the reasons why foreign wheats command a higher price than\r\nthose grown in this country.\r\n\r\nTurning to the third factor which determines the quality of wheat from\r\nthe miller’s point of view, we may for the present define strength\r\nas the capacity for making bread which suits the public taste of the\r\npresent day. We shall discuss this point more fully when we deal with\r\nthe baking of bread. At present the only generally accepted method of\r\ndetermining the strength of a sample of wheat is to mill it and bake\r\nit, usually into cottage loaves. The strength of the wheat is then\r\ndetermined from their size, shape, texture, and general appearance. A\r\nreally strong flour makes a large, well risen loaf of uniformly porous\r\ntexture. Wheats lacking in strength are known as weak. A weak wheat\r\nmakes a small flat loaf. In order to give a numerical expression to\r\nthe varying degrees of strength met with in different wheats, the Home\r\nGrown Wheat Committee of the National Association of British and Irish\r\nMillers have adopted a scale as the result of many thousand milling\r\nand baking tests. On their scale the strength of the best wheat\r\nimported from Canada, graded as No. 1 Manitoban, or from the States\r\ngraded as No. 1 Hard Spring, is taken as 100, that of the well-known\r\ngrade of flour known as London Households as 80, and that of the\r\nordinary varieties of home grown wheat, such as Square Head’s Master,\r\nBrowick, Stand Up, etc., as 65. The strength of most foreign wheats\r\nfalls within these limits. Thus the strength of Ghirka wheat from\r\nRussia is about 85, of Choice White Karachi from India 75, of Plate\r\nRiver wheat from the Argentine 80, etc. The strongest of all wheats is\r\ngrown in certain districts in Hungary. It is marked above 100 on the\r\nscale, but it is not used for bread making. The soft wheats from the\r\nmore arid regions in Australia and the States are usually weaker than\r\naverage home grown samples, and are marked at 60. Rivet or cone wheat,\r\na heavy cropping bearded variety much grown by small holders,--since\r\nthe sparrow, which would ruin small plots of any other variety, seems\r\nto dislike Rivet, possibly on account of its beard,--is the weakest of\r\nall wheats, and is only marked at 20, which means that bread baked\r\nfrom Rivet flour alone would be practically unsaleable. Rivet wheat\r\nfinds a ready sale, however, for making certain kinds of biscuits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Loaves made from No. 1 Manitoba. Strength 100]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Loaves made from average English wheat. Strength\r\n65]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Loaves made from Rivet wheat. Strength 20]\r\n\r\nIn order to make flour which will bake bread to suit the taste of the\r\ngeneral public of the present day, the miller finds it necessary to\r\ninclude in the mixture or blend of wheats which he grinds a certain\r\nproportion of strong wheats such as Canadian, American, or Russian.\r\nThe quantity of strong wheat available is limited. Consequently strong\r\nwheat commands a relatively high price. The average difference in price\r\nof say No. 1 Manitoban and home grown wheat is about 5_s._ per quarter.\r\nIt is possible of course that the public taste in bread may change,\r\nand damp close textured bread may become fashionable. In this case no\r\ndoubt the difference in price would disappear. Under present conditions\r\nthe necessity of including in his grinding mixture a considerable\r\nproportion of strong foreign wheat is a distinct handicap against the\r\ninland miller as compared with the port miller. The latter gets his\r\nforeign wheat direct from the ship in which it is imported, whilst\r\nthe former has to pay railway carriage from the port to his mill. The\r\nquestion naturally arises--is it not possible to grow strong wheats at\r\nhome and sell them to the inland miller?\r\n\r\nThis question has been definitely answered by the work of the Home\r\nGrown Wheat Committee during the last 12 years. The committee\r\ncollected strong wheats from every country where they are produced,\r\nand grew them in England. From the first crop they picked out single\r\nplants of every type represented in the mixed produce, for strong\r\nwheats as imported are usually grades and not pure varieties. From the\r\nsingle plants they have established pure strains of which they have\r\ngrown enough to mill and bake. From most of the strong wheats they\r\nwere unable to find any strain which would produce strong wheat in\r\nEngland. Thus the strong wheat of Hungary when grown in England was\r\nno stronger than any of the ordinary typical home grown wheats. But\r\nfrom the strong wheat of Canada was isolated the variety known as Red\r\nFife, which makes up a very large proportion of the higher grades of\r\nAmerican and Canadian wheats, and this variety when grown in England\r\nwas found to continue to produce wheat as strong as the best Canadian.\r\nYear after year it has been grown here, and when milled and baked its\r\nstrength has been found to be 100 or thereabouts on the scale above\r\ndescribed. Finally it was found that a strain of Red Fife which had\r\nbeen brought over from Canada 20 years ago, and grown continuously in\r\nthe western counties ever since, under the name of Cook’s Wonder, was\r\nstill producing wheat which when ground and baked possessed a strength\r\nof about 100. Thus it was conclusively proved that in the case of\r\nRed Fife at any rate the English climate was capable of producing\r\nreally strong wheat. The strength of Hungarian and Russian wheats\r\nappear to be dependent on the climate of those countries. Red Fife,\r\nhowever, produces strong wheat wherever it is grown. It is interesting\r\nto note that this variety although first exploited in Canada and the\r\nStates is really of European origin. It was taken out to Canada by an\r\nenterprising Scotchman called Fife in a mixed sample of Dantzig wheat.\r\nHe grew it for some time and distributed the seed. Pure strains have\r\nfrom time to time been selected by the American and Canadian experiment\r\nstations.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery that Red Fife would produce strong wheat in England\r\nby no means solved the problem, for when the Home Grown Wheat Committee\r\ndistributed seed of their pure strain of that variety for extended\r\ntesting throughout the country, it was soon found to be only a poor\r\nyielder except in a few districts. A yield of three quarters of strong\r\ngrain, even if it makes 40_s._ per quarter on the market, only gives to\r\nthe farmer a return of £6 per acre, as compared with a return of nearly\r\n£8 from 4½ quarters of weak grain worth 35_s._ per quarter, which can\r\nusually be obtained by growing Square Head’s Master, or some other\r\nstandard variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 10. The left-hand loaf was made from average English\r\n    wheat. The loaf in the centre was made from Burgoyne’s Fife,\r\n    and is practically identical in size and shape with the\r\n    right-hand loaf which was made from imported No. 1 Manitoba]\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Mendel’s discoveries came to the rescue.\r\nWorking on the Mendelian lines already explained, Biffen at Cambridge\r\ncrossed Red Fife with many of the best English varieties. From one of\r\nthe crosses he was able to isolate a new variety in which are combined\r\nthe strength of Red Fife and the vigour and cropping power of the\r\nEnglish parent. This variety, known as Burgoyne’s Fife, has been grown\r\nand distributed by members of the Millers’ Association. In 1911 on the\r\naverage of 28 separate trials it yielded 38 bushels per acre, which\r\nis well above the average of the best English varieties. It has been\r\nrepeatedly milled and baked, and its strength is between 90 and 100,\r\npractically the same as that of Red Fife. It has been awarded many\r\nprizes at agricultural shows for quality, and it commands on markets\r\nwhere the local millers have found out its baking qualities about the\r\nsame price as the best foreign strong wheats, that is to say from\r\n4_s._ to 5_s._ per quarter more than the average price of home grown\r\nwheat. Taking a fair average yield of wheat as four quarters per acre,\r\nBurgoyne’s Fife gives to the farmer an increased return over the\r\nordinary varieties of about 16_s._ per acre. The introduction of such a\r\nvariety makes the production of strong wheat in England a practicable\r\nreality, and will be a boon both to the farmer and to the inland\r\nmiller. It is likely too that the possibility of obtaining a better\r\nreturn per acre will induce farmers to grow more wheat. Anything that\r\ntends to increase the production of home grown wheat and makes Great\r\nBritain less dependent on foreign supplies is a national asset of the\r\ngreatest value.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance to the miller that he should be able\r\nto determine the strength of the wheats he buys. Obviously the method\r\nmentioned above, which entails milling enough of the sample to enable\r\nhim to bake a batch of bread, is far too lengthy to be of use in\r\nassessing the value of a sample with a view to purchase. The common\r\npractice is for the miller or corn merchant to buy on the reputation\r\nof the various grades of wheat, which he confirms by inspection of\r\nthe sample. Strength is usually associated with certain external\r\ncharacters which can readily be judged by the eye of the practised\r\nwheat buyer. Strong wheats are usually red in colour, their skin is\r\nthin and brittle, the grain is usually rather small, and has a very\r\ncharacteristic horny almost translucent appearance. The grains are\r\nextremely hard and brittle, and when broken the inside looks flinty.\r\nOn chewing a few grains the starch is removed and there remains in the\r\nmouth a small pellet of gluten, which is tough and elastic like rubber,\r\nbut not sticky.\r\n\r\nWeak wheats as a rule possess none of these characters. Their colour\r\nmay be either red or white, their skin is commonly thick and tough,\r\nthe grain is usually large and plump, and often has an opaque mealy\r\nappearance. It is soft and breaks easily, and the inside is white, soft\r\nand mealy. Very little gluten can be separated from it by chewing, and\r\nthat little is much less tough and elastic than the gluten of a strong\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nThese characters, however, are on the whole less reliable than the\r\nreputation of the grade of wheat under consideration. To make a\r\nreliable estimate of strength from inspection of a sample of wheat\r\nrequires a natural gift cultivated by continual practice. Even the\r\nbest commercial judges of wheat have been known to be deceived by\r\na sample of white wheat which subsequent milling and baking tests\r\nshowed to possess the highest strength. The mistake was no doubt due\r\nto the great rarity of strength among white wheats. This rarity will\r\ndoubtless soon disappear now that a pure strain of White Fife has\r\nbeen isolated and shown to possess strength quite equal to that of Red\r\nFife. Sometimes too the ordinary home grown varieties produce most\r\ndeceptive samples which show all the external characters of strong\r\nwheats. Such samples, however, on milling and baking are invariably\r\nfound to possess the usual strength of home grown wheat, about 65 on\r\nthe scale. These considerations show the great need of a scientific\r\nmethod of measuring strength, which can be carried out rapidly and on a\r\nsmall sample of grain. This need is felt at the present time not only\r\nby the miller and the merchant, but by the wheat breeder. For instance,\r\nin picking out the plants possessing strong grain from cultures of the\r\nsecond generation after making his crosses, the plant breeder up to the\r\npresent has had to rely on inspection by eye, and on the separation of\r\ngluten by chewing, for a single plant obviously cannot yield enough\r\ngrain to mill and bake. This fact no doubt explains the differences of\r\nopinion among plant breeders on the inheritance of strength, for it is\r\nnot every one who can acquire the power of judging wheat accurately by\r\nhis senses. Such a faculty is a personal gift, and is at best apt to\r\nfail at times.\r\n\r\nThe search for a rapid and accurate method of measuring strength has\r\nfor many years attracted the attention of investigators. As might be\r\nexpected most of the investigations have centred round the gluten,\r\nfor as mentioned above the gluten of a strong wheat is much more tough\r\nand elastic than that of a weak wheat. Gluten is a characteristic\r\nconstituent of all wheats, and it is the presence of gluten which\r\ngives to wheat flour the power of making bread. The other cereals,\r\nbarley, oats, maize and rice are very similar to wheat in their general\r\nchemical composition, but they do not contain gluten. Consequently they\r\ncannot make bread.\r\n\r\nIn making bread flour is mixed with water and yeast. The yeast feeds\r\non the small quantity of sugar contained in the flour, fermenting\r\nit and forming from it alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. The gluten\r\nbeing coherent and tough is blown into numberless small bubbles by\r\nthe gas, which is thus retained inside the bread. On baking, the high\r\ntemperature of the oven fixes these bubbles by drying and hardening\r\ntheir walls, and the bread is thus endowed with its characteristic\r\nporous structure. If a cereal meal devoid of gluten is mixed with water\r\nand yeast, fermentation will take place with formation of gas, but the\r\ngas will escape at once, and the product will be solid and not porous.\r\nEvidently from the baking point of view gluten is of the greatest\r\nimportance. One of the most obvious methods that have been suggested\r\nfor estimating the strength of wheat depends on the estimation of the\r\npercentage of gluten contained in the flour. The method has not turned\r\nout very successfully, for strength seems to depend rather on the\r\nquality than on the quantity of gluten in the wheat. Much attention has\r\nbeen given to the study of the causes of the varying quality of the\r\ngluten of different wheats. Gluten for instance has been shown to be\r\na mixture of two substances, gliadin and glutenin, and the suggestion\r\nhas been made that its varying properties are dependent on the varying\r\nproportions of these two substances present in different samples. This\r\nsuggestion however failed to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of investigation the author has worked out the\r\nfollowing theory of the strength of wheat flours, which has finally\r\nenabled him to devise a method which promises to be both accurate and\r\nrapid, and to require so little flour that it can readily be used by\r\nthe wheat breeder to determine the strength of the grain in a single\r\near. It has already been mentioned that a strong wheat is one that will\r\nmake a large loaf of good shape and texture. The strength of a wheat\r\nmay therefore be defined as the power of making a large loaf of good\r\nshape and texture. Evidently strength is a complex of at least two\r\nfactors, size and shape, which are likely to be quite independent of\r\neach other. Not infrequently, for instance, wheats are met with which\r\nmake large loaves of bad shape, or on the other hand, small loaves\r\nof good shape. Probably therefore the size of the loaf depends on one\r\nfactor, the shape on another; and the failure of the many attempts\r\nto devise a method of estimating strength have been caused by the\r\nimpossibility of measuring the product of two independent factors by\r\none measurement.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a feasible idea that the size of the loaf might depend on\r\nthe volume of gas formed when yeast was mixed with different flours.\r\nOn mixing different flours with water and yeast it was found that for\r\nthe first two or three hours they all gave off gas at about the same\r\nrate. The reason of this is that all flours contain about the same\r\namount of sugar, approximately one per cent., so that at the beginning\r\nof the bread fermentation all flours provide the yeast with about the\r\nsame amount of sugar for food. But this small amount of sugar is soon\r\nexhausted, and for its subsequent growth the yeast is dependent on the\r\ntransformation of some of the starch of the flour into sugar. Wheat\r\nlike many other seeds contains a ferment or enzyme called diastase,\r\nwhich has the power of changing starch into sugar, and the activity of\r\nthis ferment varies greatly in different wheats. The more active the\r\nferment in a flour the more rapid the formation of sugar. Consequently\r\nthe more rapidly the yeast will grow, and the greater will be the\r\nvolume of gas produced in the later stages of fermentation in the\r\ndough. As a rule it is not practicable to get the dough moulded into\r\nloaves and put into the oven before it has been fermenting for about\r\nsix or eight hours. If the flour possesses an active ferment it will\r\nstill be rapidly forming gas at the end of this time, and the loaf will\r\ngo into the oven distended with gas under pressure from the elasticity\r\nof the gluten which forms the walls of the bubbles. The heat of the\r\noven will cause each gas bubble to expand, and a large loaf will be the\r\nresult. If the ferment of the flour is of low activity it will not be\r\nable to keep the yeast supplied with all the sugar it needs, the volume\r\nof gas formed in the later stages of the fermentation of the dough will\r\nbe small, the dough will go into the oven without any pressure of gas\r\ninside it, little expansion will take place as the temperature rises,\r\nand a small loaf will be produced.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is quite easy to devise a method of estimating how\r\nlarge a loaf any given flour will produce. The following method is that\r\nused by the author. A small quantity of the flour, usually 20 grams,\r\nis weighed out and put into a wide mouthed bottle. A flask of water\r\nis warmed to 40° C., of this 100 c.c. is measured out, and into it 2½\r\ngrams of compressed yeast is intimately mixed, 20 c.c. of the mixture\r\nbeing added to the 20 grams of flour in the bottle. The flour and\r\nyeast-water are then mixed into a cream by stirring with a glass rod.\r\nThe bottle is then placed in a vessel of water which is kept by a small\r\nflame at 35° C. The bottle is connected to an apparatus for measuring\r\ngas, and the volume of gas given off every hour is recorded. As already\r\nmentioned all flours give off about the same volume of gas during the\r\nfirst three hours. After this length of time the volume of gas given\r\noff per hour varies greatly with different flours. Thus a flour which\r\nwill bake a large loaf gives off under the conditions above described\r\nabout 20 c.c. of gas during the sixth hour of fermentation, whilst a\r\nflour which bakes a small tight loaf gives off during the sixth hour of\r\nfermentation only about 5 c.c. of gas.\r\n\r\nHaving devised a feasible method of estimating how large a loaf any\r\ngiven flour will make, the problem of the shape and texture still\r\nremains. Previous investigators had exhausted almost every possible\r\nchemical property of gluten in their search for a method of estimating\r\nstrength. The author therefore determined to study its physical\r\nproperties. Now gluten is what is known as a colloid substance, like\r\nalbumen the chief constituent of white of egg, casein the substance\r\nwhich separates when milk is curdled, or clay which is a well known\r\nconstituent of heavy soils. Such colloid substances can scarcely be\r\nsaid to possess definite physical properties of their own, for their\r\nproperties vary so largely with their surroundings. The white of a\r\nfresh egg is a thick glairy liquid. On heating it becomes a white\r\nopaque solid, and the addition of certain acids produces a similar\r\nchange in its properties. Casein exists in fresh milk in solution. The\r\naddition of a few drops of acid causes it to separate as finely divided\r\ncurd. If, however, the milk is warmed before the acid is added the\r\ncasein separates as a sticky coherent mass. Every farmer knows that\r\nlime improves the texture of soils containing much clay, because the\r\nlime causes the clay to lose its sticky cohesive nature.\r\n\r\nSuch instances show that the properties of colloid substances are\r\nprofoundly modified by the presence of chemical substances. Wheat,\r\nlike almost all plant substances, is slightly acid, and the degree of\r\nacidity varies in different samples. Accordingly the effect of acids on\r\nthe physical properties of gluten was investigated, and it was found\r\nthat by placing bits of gluten in pure water and in acid of varying\r\nconcentration it could be made to assume any consistency from a state\r\nof division so fine that the separate particles could not be seen,\r\nexcept by noticing that their presence made the water milky, to a tough\r\ncoherent mass almost like indiarubber (Fig. 11). It was found, however,\r\nthat the concentration of acid in the wheat grain was never great\r\nenough to make the gluten really coherent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nGluten in pure water; soft, but tough and elastic\r\n\r\nGluten in very weak hydrochloric acid (3 parts in 100,000 of water); it\r\nfloats about in powder, having entirely lost cohesion, and makes the\r\nwater milky\r\n\r\nGluten in hydrochloric acid (3 parts in 1000 of water); very hard and\r\ntough]\r\n\r\nBut wheat contains also varying proportions of such salts as chlorides,\r\nsulphates and phosphates, which are soluble in water, and the action\r\nof such salts on gluten was next tried. It was at once found that\r\nthese salts in the same concentration as they exist in the wheat grain\r\nwere capable of making gluten coherent, but that the kind of coherence\r\nproduced was peculiar to each salt. Phosphates produce a tough and\r\nelastic gluten such as is found in the strongest wheats. Chlorides and\r\nsulphates on the other hand make gluten hard and brittle, like the\r\ngluten of a very weak wheat (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\nThe next step was to make chemical analyses to find out the amount of\r\nsoluble salts in different wheats. Strong wheats of the Fife class\r\nwere found to contain not less than 1 part of soluble phosphate in\r\n1000 parts of wheat, whilst Rivet wheat, the weakest wheat that comes\r\non the market, contained only half that amount. Rivet, however, was\r\nfound to be comparatively rich in soluble chlorides and sulphates,\r\nwhich are present in very small amounts in strong wheats of the Fife\r\nclass. Ordinary English wheats resemble Rivet, but they contain rather\r\nmore phosphate and rather less chlorides and sulphates. After making a\r\ngreat many analyses it was found that the amount of soluble phosphate\r\nin a wheat was a very good index of the shape and texture of the loaf\r\nwhich it would make. The toughness and elasticity of the gluten no\r\ndoubt depend on the concentration of the soluble phosphate in the wheat\r\ngrain, the more the soluble phosphate the tougher and more elastic\r\nthe gluten, and a tough and elastic gluten holds the loaf in shape as\r\nit expands in the oven, and prevents the small bubbles of gas running\r\ntogether into large holes and spoiling the texture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nGluten in water containing both acid and phosphate; very tough and\r\nelastic\r\n\r\nGluten in water containing both acid and sulphates. It shows varying\r\ndegrees of coherence, but is brittle or “short”]\r\n\r\nThese facts suggest at once a method for estimating the shape and\r\ntexture of the loaf which can be made from any given sample of wheat.\r\nAn analysis showing the amount of soluble phosphate in the sample\r\nshould give the desired information. But unfortunately such an analysis\r\nis not an easy one to make, and requires a considerable quantity of\r\nflour. In making these analyses it was noticed that when the flours\r\nwere shaken with water to dissolve the phosphate, and the insoluble\r\nsubstance removed by filtering, the solutions obtained were always more\r\nor less turbid, and the degree of turbidity was found to be related\r\nto the amount of phosphate present and to the shape of loaf produced.\r\nOn further investigation it was found that the turbidity was due to\r\nthe fact that the concentration of acid and salts which make gluten\r\ncoherent, also dissolve some of it, and gluten like other colloids\r\ngives a turbid solution. It was also found that the amount of gluten\r\ndissolved, and consequently the degree of turbidity, is related to\r\nthe shape of the loaf which the flour will produce. Now it is quite\r\neasy to measure the degree of turbidity of a solution by pouring the\r\nsolution into a glass vessel below which a small electric lamp is\r\nplaced, and noting the depth of the liquid through which the filament\r\nof the lamp can just be seen. The turbidities were, however, so slight\r\nthat it was found necessary to increase them by adding a little iodine\r\nsolution which gives a brown milkiness with solutions of gluten, the\r\ndegree of milkiness depending on the amount of gluten in the solution.\r\nIn this way a method was devised which is rapid, easy, and can be\r\ncarried out with so little wheat that the produce of one ear is amply\r\nsufficient. It can therefore be used by the plant breeder for picking\r\nout from the progeny of his crosses those individual plants which are\r\nlikely to give shapely loaves. The method is as follows: An ear of\r\nwheat is rubbed out and ground to powder in a small mill. One gram of\r\nthis powder, or of flour if that is to be tested, is weighed out and\r\nput into a small bottle. To it is added 20 c.c. of water. The bottle\r\nis then shaken for one hour. At the end of this time the contents are\r\npoured onto a filter. To 15 c.c. of the solution 1½ c.c. of a weak\r\nsolution of iodine is added, and after standing for half an hour the\r\nturbidity test is applied. Working in this way it is possible to see\r\nthrough only 10 c.m. of the solution thus obtained from such a wheat as\r\nRed Fife, as compared with 25 c.m. in the case of Rivet. Other wheats\r\nyield solutions of intermediate opacity. This method is now being\r\ntested in connection with the Cambridge wheat breeding experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MILLING OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that wheat may be made into bread it is necessary that it\r\nshould be reduced to powder. In prehistoric times this was effected by\r\ngrinding the grain between stones. Two stones were commonly used, the\r\nlower one being more or less hollowed on its upper surface so as to\r\nhold the grain while it was rubbed by the upper one. As man became more\r\nexpert in providing for his wants, the lower stone was artificially\r\nhollowed, and the upper one shaped to fit it, until in process of time\r\nthe two stones assumed the form of a primitive mortar and pestle.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the evolution of the mill was to make a hole or groove\r\nin the side of the lower stone through which the powdered wheat could\r\npass as it was ground. This device avoided the trouble of emptying the\r\nprimitive mill, and materially saved the labour of the grinder. Such\r\nmills are still in use in the less civilised countries in the East, and\r\nare of course worked by hand as in primitive times.\r\n\r\nThey gradually developed as civilization progressed into the stone\r\nmills which ground all the breadstuffs of the civilised world until\r\nabout 40 years ago. The old fashioned stone mill was, and indeed still\r\nis, a weapon of the greatest precision. It consists of a pair of stones\r\nabout four feet in diameter, the lower of which is fixed whilst the\r\nupper is made to revolve by mechanical power at a high speed. Each\r\nstone is made of a large number of pieces of a special kind of hard\r\nstone obtained from France. These pieces are cemented together, and\r\nthe surfaces which come into contact are patiently chipped until they\r\nfit one another to a nicety all over. The surface of the lower stone\r\nis then grooved so as to lead the flour to escape from between the\r\nstones at definite places where it is received for further treatment.\r\nThe grain to be ground is fed between the stones through a hole at the\r\ncentre of the upper stone. It has been stated above that the surfaces\r\nof the two stones are in contact. As a matter of fact this is not\r\nstrictly true. The upper stone is suspended so that the surfaces are\r\nseparated by a small fraction of an inch, and it will be realised\r\nat once that this suspension is a matter of the greatest delicacy.\r\nTo balance a stone weighing over half a ton so that, when revolving\r\nat a high rate of speed, it may be separated from its partner at no\r\npoint over its entire surface of about 12 square feet by more than\r\nthe thickness of the skin of a grain of wheat, and yet may nowhere\r\ncome into actual contact, is an achievement of no mean order. Stone\r\nmills of this kind were usually driven by water power, or in flat\r\nneighbourhoods by wind power, though in some cases steam was used.\r\n\r\nIt was the common practice to subject the ground wheat from the stones\r\nto a process of sifting so as to remove the particles of husk from\r\nthe flour. The sifting was effected by shaking the ground wheat in a\r\nseries of sieves of finely woven silk, known as bolting cloth. In this\r\nway it was possible to obtain a flour which would make a white bread.\r\nThe particles of husk removed by the sifting were sold to farmers for\r\nfood for their animals, under the name of bran, sharps, pollards, or\r\nmiddlings, local names for products of varying degrees of fineness,\r\nwhich may be classed together under the general term wheat offals. The\r\nideal of the miller was to set his stones so that they would grind\r\nthe flour to a fine powder without breaking up the husk more than was\r\nabsolutely necessary. When working satisfactorily a pair of stones were\r\nsupposed to strip off the husk from the kernel. The kernel should then\r\nbe finely pulverised. The husk should be flattened out between the\r\nstones, which should rub off from the inside as completely as possible\r\nall adhering particles of kernel. If this ideal were attained, the\r\nmill would yield a large proportion of fairly white flour, and a small\r\nproportion of husk or offals.\r\n\r\nAs long as home grown wheats were used this ideal could be more or\r\nless attained because the husk of these wheats is tough and the kernel\r\nsoft. Comparatively little grinding suffices to reduce the kernel to\r\nthe requisite degree of fineness, and this the tough husk will stand\r\nwithout being itself unduly pulverised. Consequently the husk remains\r\nin fairly large pieces, and can be separated by sifting, with the\r\nresult that a white flour can be produced. But home grown wheat ceased\r\nto provide for the wants of the nation more than half a century ago.\r\nAlready in 1870 half the wheat ground into flour in the United Kingdom\r\nwas imported from abroad, and this proportion has steadily increased,\r\nuntil at the present time only about one-fifth of the wheat required is\r\ngrown at home. Many of the wheats which are imported are harder in the\r\nkernel, and thinner and more brittle in the husk, than the home grown\r\nvarieties. Consequently they require more grinding to reduce the kernel\r\nto the requisite degree of fineness, and their thin brittle husk is\r\nnot able to resist such treatment. It is itself ground to powder along\r\nwith the kernel, and cannot be completely separated from the flour\r\nby sifting. Such wheats therefore, when ground between stones, yield\r\nflour which contains much finely divided husk, and this lowers its\r\ndigestibility and gives it a dark colour.\r\n\r\nIn the decades before 1870 when the imports of foreign wheats first\r\nreached serious proportions, and all milling was done by stones, dark\r\ncoloured flours were common, and people would no doubt have accepted\r\nthem without protest, if no other flours had been available. But as it\r\nhappened millers in Hungary, where hard kernelled, thin skinned wheats\r\nhad long been commonly grown, devised the roller milling process, which\r\nproduces fine white flour from such wheats, no matter how hard their\r\nkernels or how thin their skins. The idea of grinding wheat between\r\nrollers was at once taken up in America and found to give excellent\r\nresults with the hard thin skinned wheats of the north-west. The fine\r\nwhite flours thus produced were sent to England, and at once ousted\r\nfrom the home markets the dark coloured flours produced from imported\r\nwheats in the English stone mills. The demand for the white well-risen\r\nbread produced from these roller milled imported flours showed at once\r\nthat the public preferred such bread to the darker coloured heavier\r\nbread yielded by stone-ground flours, especially those made from the\r\nthin skinned foreign wheats.\r\n\r\nThis state of things was serious both for the millers and the farmers.\r\nThe importation of flour instead of wheat must obviously ruin the\r\nmilling industry, and since wheat offals form no inconsiderable item\r\nin the list of feeding stuffs available for stock keepers, a decline\r\nof the milling industry restricts the supply of food for his stock,\r\nand thus indirectly affects the farmer. At the same time the preference\r\nshown by the public for bread made from fine white imported flour, to\r\nsome extent depreciated the value of home grown wheat.\r\n\r\nIt was by economic conditions of this kind that the millers were\r\ncompelled in the early seventies to alter their methods. The large\r\nfirms subscribed more capital and installed roller plant in their\r\nmills. These at once proved a success and the other firms have followed\r\nsuit. At the present time considerably more than 90 per cent. of the\r\nflour used in this country is the product of roller mills. The keen\r\ncompetition which has arisen in the milling industry during the last 35\r\nyears has produced great improvements in roller plant, and the methods\r\nof separation now in use yield flours which in the opinion of the\r\nmiller, and apparently too in the opinion of the general public, are\r\nfar in advance of the flours which were produced in the days of stone\r\nmilling.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first impression which a visitor to a modern roller mill\r\nwould receive is the great extent to which mechanical contrivances have\r\nreplaced hand labour. Once the wheat has been delivered at the mill\r\nit is not moved again by hand until it goes away as flour and offals.\r\nIt is carried along by rapidly moving belts, elevated by endless\r\nchains carrying buckets, allowed to fall again by gravity, or perhaps\r\nin other cases transported by air currents. Another very striking\r\ndevelopment is the great care expended in cleaning the grain before\r\nit is ground. This cleaning is the first process to which the wheat\r\nis subjected. It is especially necessary in the case of some of the\r\nforeign wheats which arrive in this country in a very dirty condition.\r\nThe impurities consist of earth, weed seeds, bits of husk and straw;\r\niron nails, and other equally unlikely objects are by no means\r\nuncommon. Some of these are removed by screens, but besides screening\r\nthe wheat is actually subjected to the process of washing with water.\r\nFor this purpose it is elevated to an upper floor of the mill, and\r\nallowed to fall downwards through a tall vessel through which a stream\r\nof water is made to flow. As it passes through the water it is scrubbed\r\nby a series of mechanically driven brushes to remove the earthy matter\r\nwhich adheres to the grain. This is carried away by the stream of water.\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning the grain next undergoes the process of conditioning.\r\nThe object of this process is so to adjust the moisture of the grain\r\nthat the husk may attain its maximum toughness compatible with a\r\nreasonable degree of brittleness of kernel, the idea being to powder\r\nthe kernel with the minimum of grinding and without unduly powdering\r\nthe husk. By attention to this process separation of flour and husk\r\nis made easier and more complete. The essential points in the process\r\nare to moisten the grain, either in the course of cleaning as above\r\ndescribed, or if washing is not necessary, by direct addition of water.\r\nThe moisture is given some time to be absorbed into the grain, which is\r\nthen dried until the moisture content falls to what experience shows to\r\nbe the most successful figure for the wheat in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. First break rolls seen from one end. The ribs\r\ncan just be seen where the two rolls touch]\r\n\r\nCleaning and conditioning having been attended to, the grain is now\r\nconveyed to the mill proper. This of course is done by a mechanical\r\narrangement which feeds the grain at any desired rate into the hopper\r\nwhich supplies the first pair of rolls. These rolls consist of a pair\r\nof steel cylinders usually 10 inches in diameter and varying in length\r\nfrom 20 inches to 5 feet according to the capacity of the mill. The\r\nsurfaces of the cylinders are fluted or ribbed, the distance from\r\nrib to rib being about one-tenth of an inch. The rollers are mounted\r\nso that the distance between their surfaces can be adjusted. They\r\nare set so that they will break grains passing between them to from\r\none-half to one-quarter their original size. They are made to revolve\r\nso that the parts of the surfaces between which the grains are nipped\r\nare travelling in the same direction. One roll revolves usually at\r\nabout 350 revolutions per minute, the other at rather less than half\r\nthat rate (Fig. 14). It is obvious from the above description that a\r\ngrain of wheat falling from the hopper on to the surface of the moving\r\nrollers will be crushed or nipped between them, and that since the\r\nrollers are moving at different rates, it will at the same time be more\r\nor less torn apart. By altering the distance between the rollers and\r\ntheir respective speeds of revolution the relative amounts of nipping\r\nand tearing can be adjusted to suit varying conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 14. Break rolls. The large and small cog-wheels are the\r\n    simplest device used to give the two rolls different speeds.\r\n    The larger cog-wheel is driven by power and drives the smaller,\r\n    of course at a much higher rate of revolution]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the grain through such a pair of rollers is known\r\ntechnically as a break. Its object is to break or tear open the grain\r\nwith the least possible amount of friction between the grain and the\r\ngrinding surfaces. Since the rollers are cylindrical it is obvious that\r\nthe grain will only be nipped at one point of their surfaces, and even\r\nhere the friction is reduced as much as possible by making both the\r\ngrinding surfaces move in the same direction. As already explained it\r\ncan be diminished, if the condition of the wheat allows, by diminishing\r\nthe difference in speed between the two rolls. The result of the first\r\nbreak is to tear open the grains. At the same time a small amount of\r\nthe kernel will be finely powdered. The rest of the kernel and husk\r\nwill still remain in comparatively large pieces. The tearing open of\r\nthe grain sets free the dirt which was lodged in the crack or furrow\r\nwhich extends from end to end of the grain. This dirt cannot be removed\r\nby any method of cleaning. It only escapes when the grain is torn\r\nopen in the break. It is generally finely divided dirt and cannot be\r\nseparated from the flour formed in this process. Consequently the\r\nfirst break flour is often more or less dirty, and the miller tries to\r\nadjust his first break rolls so that they will form as little flour as\r\npossible. The first break rolls not only powder a little of the kernel,\r\nbut they also reduce to a more or less fine state of division a little\r\nof the husk.\r\n\r\nThe result of the passage of the grain through the first break rolls\r\nis to produce from it a mixture of a large quantity of comparatively\r\ncoarse particles of kernel to many of which husk is still adherent,\r\na small quantity of finely divided flour which is more or less\r\ndiscoloured with dirt, and a small quantity of finely divided husk.\r\nThis mixture, which is technically known as stock, is at once subjected\r\nto what is called separation, with the object of separating the flour\r\nfrom the other constituents before it undergoes any further grinding.\r\nIt is one of the guiding principles of modern milling that the flour\r\nproduced at each operation should be separated at once so as to reduce\r\nto a minimum the grinding which it has to undergo. Separation is\r\nbrought about by the combination of two methods. The stock is shaken\r\nin contact with a screen made of bolting silk so finely woven that it\r\ncontains from 50 to 150 meshes to the inch, according to the fineness\r\nof the flour which it is desired to separate. The shaking is effected\r\nin several different ways. Sometimes the silk is stretched on a frame\r\nso as to make a kind of flat sieve. This is shaken mechanically whilst\r\nthe stock is allowed to trickle over its surface, so that the finely\r\ndivided particles of flour may fall through the meshes and be collected\r\nseparately from the larger particles which remain on the top. These\r\nlarger particles are partly heavy bits of broken kernel and partly\r\nlight bits of torn husk. In order to separate them advantage is taken\r\nof the fact that a current of wind can be so adjusted that it will blow\r\naway the light and fluffy husk particles without disturbing the heavy\r\nbits of kernel. By means of a mechanically driven fan a current of\r\nair is blown over the surface of the sieve, in the direction opposite\r\nto that in which the stock is travelling. As the stock rolls over and\r\nover in its passage from the upper to the lower end of the inclined\r\nsieve the fluffy particles of husk are picked up by the air current\r\nand carried back to the top of the sieve where they fall, as the\r\ncurrent slackens, into a receptacle placed to receive them. Thus by\r\nthe combination of sifting and air carriage the stock is separated\r\ninto a small quantity of finished flour, a small quantity of finished\r\nhusk or offal, and a large quantity of large particles of kernel with\r\nhusk still adhering to some of them. These large particles, which\r\nare called semolina, of course require further grinding. Different\r\nmethods of sifting are often used in place of the one above described,\r\nespecially for completing the purification of the flour. Sometimes the\r\nsilk is stretched round a more or less circular frame so as to form\r\na long cylinder covered with silk. The stock is delivered into the\r\nhigher end of this cylinder which is made to revolve. This causes the\r\nstock to work its way through the cylinder, and during its progress the\r\nfinely ground flour finds its way through the meshes, and is separated\r\nas before from the coarser particles. Such a revolving sieve is known\r\nas a reel. In a somewhat similar arrangement known as a centrifugal\r\na series of beaters is made to revolve rapidly inside a stationary\r\ncylindrical sieve. The stock is admitted at one end and is thrown by\r\nthe revolving beaters against the silk cover. The finer particles are\r\ndriven through the meshes of the silk, the coarser particles find their\r\nway out of the cylinder at the other end. Sometimes for separating\r\nvery coarse particles wire sieves of 30 meshes, or thereabouts, to the\r\ninch are used. Whatever the method the object is to separate at once\r\nthe finished flour and offal from the large particles of kernel which\r\nrequire further grinding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 15. A pair of reduction rolls. They are smooth, and the\r\n    cog-wheels being nearly of the same size the speed of the two\r\n    rolls is nearly equal]\r\n\r\nThese large particles, semolina, are next passed between one or more\r\npairs of smooth rolls known as reduction rolls (Fig. 15). These are\r\nset rather nearer together than the break rolls, and the difference\r\nin speed between each roll and its partner is quite small. The object\r\nof reduction is to reduce the size of the large particles of semolina\r\nand to produce thereby finely divided flour. The stock from the first\r\npair or pairs of reduction rolls contains much finely ground flour\r\nmixed with coarser particles of kernel with or without adherent husk.\r\nIt is at once submitted to the separation and purification processes\r\nas above described. This yields a large quantity of finished flour\r\nwhich is very white and free from husk. It represents commercially\r\nthe highest grade of flour separated in the mill and is described\r\ntechnically as patents. A small amount of finished offal is also\r\nseparated at this stage.\r\n\r\nThe coarse particles of kernel with adherent husk from which the flour\r\nand offal have been separated are now passed through a second pair of\r\nbreak rolls more finely fluted than before, known as the second break.\r\nThese are set closer together than the first break rolls. Their object\r\nis to rub off more kernel from the husk. The stock from them is again\r\nseparated, the flour and finished offal being removed as before. The\r\ncoarser particles are again reduced by smooth reduction rolls, and a\r\nsecond large quantity of flour separated. This is commercially high\r\ngrade flour and is usually mixed with the patents already separated.\r\nThe coarse particles left after this separation are usually subjected\r\nto a third and a fourth break, each of which is succeeded by one or\r\ntwo reductions. Separation of the stock and purification of the flour\r\ntake place after each rolling, so that as soon as any flour or husk is\r\nfinely ground it may be at once separated without further grinding.\r\nThe last pair of fluted rolls, the fourth break, are set so closely\r\ntogether that they practically touch both sides of the pieces of\r\nhusk which pass through them. They are intended to scrape the last\r\nparticles of kernel from the husk. This is very severe treatment, and\r\nusually results in the production of much finely powdered husk which\r\ngoes through the sifting silk and cannot be separated from the flour.\r\nThe flour from the fourth break is therefore usually discoloured by the\r\npresence of much finely divided husk. For this reason it ranks as of\r\nlow commercial grade. The later reductions too yield flours containing\r\nmore or less husk, which darkens their colour. They are usually mixed\r\ntogether and sold as seconds.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the germ in the process of roller milling is a point of\r\nconsiderable interest, both on account of the ingenious way in which\r\nit is removed, and because of the mysterious nutritive properties\r\nwhich it is commonly assumed to possess. The germ of a grain of wheat\r\nforms only about 1½ per cent. by weight of the grain. It differs in\r\ncomposition from the rest of the grain, being far richer in protein,\r\nfat, and phosphorus. Its special feeding value can, however, scarcely\r\nbe explained in terms of these ingredients, for its total amount is so\r\nsmall that its presence or absence in the flour can make only a very\r\nslight difference in the percentages of these substances. But this\r\npoint will be discussed fully in a subsequent chapter. Here it is the\r\npresence of the fat which is chiefly of interest. According to the\r\nmillers the fat of the germ is prone to become rancid, and to impart\r\nto the flour, on keeping, a peculiar taste and odour which affects its\r\ncommercial value. They have therefore devised with great ingenuity a\r\nsimple method of removing it. This method depends on the fact that the\r\npresence in the germ of so much fat prevents it from being ground to\r\npowder in its passage between the rolls. Instead of being ground it\r\nis pressed out into little flat discs which are far too large to pass\r\nwith the flour through the sifting silks or wires, and far too heavy to\r\nbe blown away by the air currents which remove the offals. The amount\r\nwhich is thus separated is usually about 1 per cent. of the grain so\r\nthat one third of the total quantity of germ present in the grain is\r\nnot removed as such. Considerable difficulties arise in attempting to\r\ntrace this fraction, and at present it is impossible to state with\r\ncertainty what becomes of it. The germ which is separated is sold by\r\nthe ordinary miller to certain firms which manufacture what are known\r\nas germ flours. It is subjected to a process of cooking which is said\r\nto prevent it from going rancid, after which it is ground with wheat,\r\nthe product being patent germ flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing the method of transforming flour into bread it will be\r\nconvenient to begin by describing in detail one general method. The\r\nmodifications used for obtaining bread of different kinds, and for\r\ndealing with flours of different qualities will be shortly discussed\r\nlater when they can be more readily understood.\r\n\r\nBread may be defined as the product of cooking or baking a mixture of\r\nflour, water, and salt, which is made porous by the addition of yeast.\r\nIt is understood to contain no other substances than these--flour,\r\nsalt, water and yeast.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary process the first step is to weigh out the flour which\r\nit is proposed to bake. This is then transferred to a vessel which in a\r\ncommercial bakery is usually a large wooden trough, in a private house\r\nan earthenware bowl. The necessary amount of yeast is next weighed out\r\nand mixed with water. Nowadays compressed or German yeast is almost\r\nalways used at the rate of 1 to 2 lbs. per sack or 280 lbs. of flour.\r\nFor smaller quantities of flour relatively more yeast is needed, for\r\ninstance 2 ozs. per stone. Formerly brewers’ yeast or barm was used,\r\nbut its use has practically ceased because it is difficult to obtain\r\nof standard strength. Some people who profess to be connoisseurs of\r\nbread still prefer it because as they say it gives a better flavour\r\nto the bread. The water with which the yeast is mixed is warmed so as\r\nto make the yeast more active. The flour is then heaped up at one end\r\nof the vessel in which the mixing is to take place, and salt at the\r\nrate of 2 to 5 lbs. per sack is thoroughly stirred into it. A hollow\r\nis then made in the heap of flour into which the mixture of yeast and\r\nwater is poured. More warm water is added so that enough water in all\r\nmay be present to convert all, or nearly all, the flour into dough of\r\nthe required consistency. When dealing with a flour with which he is\r\nfamiliar the baker knows by experience how much water he requires per\r\nsack. In the case of an unaccustomed brand of flour he determines the\r\namount by a preliminary trial with a small quantity (Figs. 16 and 17).\r\nFlour from the heap is then stirred into the water until the whole of\r\nthe flour is converted into a stiff paste or dough as it is called.\r\nBy this method a little dry flour will always separate the dough from\r\nthe sides of the vessel and this will prevent the dough from sticking\r\nto the vessel and the hands. The dough is then thoroughly worked or\r\nkneaded so as to ensure the intimate mixture of the ingredients. The\r\nvessel is then covered to keep the dough warm. In private houses\r\nthis is ensured by placing the vessel near the fire. In bakeries the\r\nroom in which the mixing is conducted is usually kept at a suitable\r\ntemperature. The yeast cells which are thoroughly incorporated in the\r\ndough, find themselves in possession of all they require to enable them\r\nto grow. The presence of water keeps them moist, and dissolves from\r\nthe flour for their use sugar and salts: the dough is kept warm as\r\nabove explained. Under these conditions active fermentation takes place\r\nwith the formation of alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. The alcohol is\r\nof no particular consequence in bread making, the small amount formed\r\nis probably expelled from the bread during its stay in the oven. The\r\ncarbon dioxide, however, plays a most important part. Being a gas it\r\noccupies a large volume, and its formation throughout the mass of the\r\ndough causes the dough to increase greatly in volume. The dough is said\r\nby the housewife to rise, by the professional baker to prove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 16. Apparatus arranged for a baking test. Four loaves\r\n    which have just been scaled and moulded are seen in an\r\n    incubator where they are left to rise or prove before being\r\n    transferred to the oven]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Fig. 17. The loaves shown in the last figure have just been\r\n    baked and are ready to be taken out of the oven, the door of\r\n    which is open. Note the different shapes. That on the right\r\n    hand is obviously shown by the test to be made from a strong\r\n    flour, the other from a very weak flour]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of kneading causes the particles of gluten to absorb\r\nwater and to adhere to one another, so that the dough may be regarded\r\nas being composed of innumerable bubbles each surrounded by a thin\r\nfilm of gluten, in or between which lie the starch grains and other\r\nconstituents of the flour. Each yeast cell as above explained forms a\r\ncentre for the formation of carbon dioxide gas, which cannot escape\r\nat once into the air, and must therefore form a little bubble of\r\ngas inside the particular film of gluten which happens to surround\r\nit. The expansion of the dough is due to the formation inside it of\r\nthousands of these small bubbles. It is to the formation of these\r\nbubbles too that the porous honey-combed structure of wheaten bread is\r\ndue. Also since the formation of the bubbles is due to the retention\r\nof the carbon dioxide by the gluten films, such a porous structure is\r\nimpossible in bread made from the flour of grains which do not contain\r\ngluten.\r\n\r\nThe rising of the dough is usually allowed to proceed for several\r\nhours. The baker finds by experience how long a fermentation is\r\nrequired to give the best results with the flours he commonly uses.\r\nWhen the proper time has elapsed, the dough is removed from the trough\r\nor pan in which it was mixed to a board or table, previously dusted\r\nwith dry flour to prevent the dough adhering to the board or to the\r\nhands. It is then divided into portions of the proper weight to\r\nmake loaves of the desired size. This process is known technically\r\nas scaling. Usually 2 lbs. 3 ozs. of dough is allowed for baking a 2\r\nlb. loaf. Each piece of dough is now moulded into the proper shape if\r\nit is desired to bake what is known as a cottage loaf, or placed in\r\na baking tin if the baker is satisfied with a tinned loaf. In either\r\ncase the dough is once more kept for some time at a sufficiently warm\r\ntemperature for the yeast to grow so that the dough may once more be\r\nfilled with bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. As soon as this second\r\nrising or proving has proceeded far enough the loaves are transferred\r\nto the oven. Here the intense heat causes the bubbles of gas inside\r\nthe dough to expand so that a sudden increase in the size of the loaf\r\ntakes place. At the same time the outside of the loaf is hardened and\r\nconverted into crust.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in the oven for the requisite time the bread is\r\nwithdrawn and allowed to cool as quickly as possible, after which it is\r\nready for use or sale.\r\n\r\nThe method of baking which has been described above is known as the\r\noff-hand or straight dough method. It possesses the merit of rapidity\r\nand simplicity, but it is said by experts that it does not yield the\r\nbest quality of bread from certain flours. Perhaps the commonest\r\nvariation is that known as the sponge and dough method, which is\r\ncarried out as follows. As before, the requisite amount of flour is\r\nweighed out into the mixing trough, and a depression made in it for\r\nthe reception of the water and yeast. These are mixed together in the\r\nproper proportions, enough being taken to make a thick cream with\r\nabout one quarter of the flour. This mixture is now poured into the\r\ndepression in the flour, and enough of the surrounding flour stirred\r\ninto it to make a thick cream or sponge as it is called. At the same\r\ntime a small quantity of salt is added to the mixture. The sponge is\r\nallowed to ferment for some hours, being kept warm as in the former\r\nmethod. As soon as the time allowed for the fermentation of the sponge\r\nhas elapsed, more water is added, so that the whole or nearly the whole\r\nof the flour can be worked up into dough. This dough is immediately\r\nscaled and moulded into loaves, which after being allowed to prove\r\nor rise for some time are baked as before. This method is used for\r\nflours which do not yield good bread when they are submitted to long\r\nfermentation. In such cases the mellow flours, which will only stand a\r\nvery short fermentation, are first weighed out into the mixing trough,\r\nand a depression made in the mass of flour into which a quantity of\r\nstrong flour which can be fermented safely for a long time is added. It\r\nis this last addition which is mixed up into the sponge to undergo the\r\nlong preliminary fermentation. The rest of the flour is mixed in after\r\nthis first fermentation is over, so that it is only subjected to the\r\ncomparatively slight fermentation which goes on in the final process of\r\nproving.\r\n\r\nMany other modifications are commonly practised locally, their object\r\nbeing for the most part to yield bread which suits the local taste.\r\nIt will suffice to mention one which has a special interest. In this\r\nmethod the essentially interesting point is the preparation of what is\r\nknown as a ferment. For this purpose a quantity of potatoes is taken,\r\nabout a stone to the sack of flour. After peeling and cleaning they\r\nare boiled and mashed up with water into a cream. To this a small\r\nquantity of yeast is added and the mixture kept warm until fermentation\r\nceases, as shown by the cessation of the production of gas. During\r\nthis fermentation the yeast increases enormously, so that a very small\r\nquantity of yeast suffices to make enough ferment for a sack of flour.\r\nThe flour is now measured out into the trough, and the ferment and some\r\nadditional water and salt added so that the whole can be worked up into\r\ndough. Scaling, moulding, and baking are then conducted as before. This\r\nmethod was in general use years ago when yeast was dear. It has fallen\r\nsomewhat into disuse in these days of cheap compressed yeast, in fact\r\nthe use of potatoes nowadays would make the process expensive.\r\n\r\nIn private houses and in the smaller local bakeries the whole of the\r\nprocesses described above are carried out by hand. During the last\r\nfew decades many very large companies have been formed to take up\r\nthe production of bread on the large scale. This has caused almost\r\na revolution of the methods of manipulating flour and dough, and in\r\nmany cases nowadays almost every process in the bakery is carried out\r\nby machinery. In many of the larger bakeries doughing and kneading\r\nare carried out by machines, and this applies also to the processes\r\nof scaling and moulding. A similar change has taken place too in the\r\nconstruction of ovens. Years ago an oven consisted of a cavity in a\r\nlarge block of masonry. Wood was burned in the cavity until the walls\r\nattained a sufficiently high temperature. The remains of the fuel were\r\nthen raked out and the bread put in and baked by radiation from the hot\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nNowadays it is not customary to burn fuel in the oven itself, nor is\r\nthe fuel always wood or even coal. The fuel is burned in a furnace\r\nunderneath the oven, and coal or gas is generally used. Sometimes\r\nhowever the source of heat is electricity. In all cases it is still\r\nrecognised that the heat should be radiated from massive solid walls\r\nmaintained at a high temperature. In the latest type of oven the heat\r\nis conducted through the walls by closed iron tubes containing water,\r\nwhich of course at the high temperatures employed becomes superheated\r\nsteam. It is recognised that the ovens commonly provided in modern\r\nprivate houses, whether heated by the fire of the kitchen range, or by\r\ngas, are not capable of baking bread of the best quality, because their\r\nwalls do not radiate heat to the same degree as the massive walls of a\r\nproper bake oven.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly agreed that bread, in the usual acceptation of the term,\r\nshould contain nothing but flour, yeast, salt, and water; or if other\r\nthings are present they should consist only of the products formed by\r\nthe interaction of these four substances in the process of baking.\r\nMillers and bakers have, however, found by experience that the addition\r\nof certain substances to the flour or to the dough may sometimes enable\r\nthem substantially to improve the market value of the bread produced by\r\ncertain flours. The possible good or bad effect of such additions on\r\nthe public health will be discussed in a later chapter. It may be of\r\ninterest here to mention some of the substances which are commonly used\r\nas flour or bread improvers by millers and bakers, and to discuss the\r\nmethods by which they effect their so called improvements.\r\n\r\nIn a former chapter we have discussed the quality of wheat from the\r\nmiller’s point of view, and during the discussion certain views were\r\nenunciated on the subject of strength. It was pointed out that a strong\r\nflour was one which would make a large well-shaped loaf, and that the\r\nsize of the loaf was dependent on the flour being able to provide sugar\r\nfor the yeast to feed upon right up to the moment when the loaf goes\r\ninto the oven. This can only occur when the flour contains an active\r\nferment which keeps changing the starch into sugar. That this view is\r\ngenerally accepted in practice is shown by the fact that, when using\r\nflours deficient in such ferment, bakers commonly add to the flour,\r\nyeast, salt, and water, a quantity of malt extract, the characteristic\r\nconstituent of which is the sugar producing ferment of the malt. This\r\nuse of malt extract is now extending to the millers, several of whom\r\nhave installed in their mills plant for spraying into their flour a\r\nstrong solution of malt extract. It seems to be agreed by millers and\r\nbakers generally that such an addition to a flour which makes small\r\nloaves distinctly increases the size of the loaf. There can be no doubt\r\nthat this effect is produced by the ferment of the malt extract keeping\r\nup the supply of sugar, and thus enabling the yeast to maintain the\r\npressure of gas in the dough right up to the moment when it goes into\r\nthe oven.\r\n\r\nThe view that the shape of the loaf is due to the effect of salts, and\r\nparticularly of phosphates, on the coherence of the gluten has also\r\nbeen put to practical use by the millers and the bakers. Preparations\r\nof phosphates under various fancy names are now on the market, and are\r\nbought by bakers for adding to the flour to strengthen the gluten and\r\nproduce more shapely loaves. A few millers too are beginning to spray\r\nsolutions of phosphates into their flours with the same object in view,\r\nand such additions are said to make material improvements in the shape\r\nof the loaf produced by certain weak flours.\r\n\r\nThese two substances, malt extract and phosphates, are added to the\r\nflour with the definite object of improving the strength and thus\r\nmaking larger and more shapely loaves. But there is a second class of\r\nsubstances which are commonly added to flours, not in the mill but in\r\nthe process of bread making, with the object of replacing yeast. Yeast\r\nis used in baking in order that it may form gas inside the dough and\r\nthus produce a light spongy loaf. Exactly the same gas can be readily\r\nand cheaply produced by the interaction of a carbonate with an acid.\r\nThese substances will not react to produce acid as long as they remain\r\ndry, but as soon as they are brought into close contact with each other\r\nby the presence of water, reaction begins and carbon dioxide gas is\r\nformed. These facts are taken advantage of in the manufacture of baking\r\npowders and self-rising flours. Baking powders commonly consist of\r\nordinary bicarbonate of soda mixed with an acid or an acid salt, such\r\nas tartaric acid, cream of tartar, acid phosphate of lime, or acid\r\nphosphate of potash. One of these latter acid substances is mixed in\r\nproper proportions with the bicarbonate of soda, and the mixture ground\r\nup with powdered starch which serves to dilute the chemicals and to\r\nkeep them dry. A small quantity of the baking powder is mixed with the\r\nflour before the water is added to make the dough. The presence of the\r\nwater causes the acid and the carbonate to give off gas which, as in\r\nthe case of the gas formed by the growth of yeast, fills the dough with\r\nbubbles which expand in the oven and produce light spongy bread. When\r\nusing baking powders in place of yeast it must not be forgotten that\r\ngas formation in most cases begins immediately the water is added, and\r\nlasts for a very short time. Consequently the dough must be moulded and\r\nbaked at once or the gas will escape. This is not the case, however,\r\nwith those powders which are made with cream of tartar, for this\r\nsubstance does not react with the carbonate to any great extent until\r\nthe dough gets warm in the oven. For some purposes it is customary to\r\nuse carbonate of ammonia, technically known as volatile, in place of\r\nbaking powder. This substance is used alone without any addition of\r\nacid, because it decomposes when heated and forms gas inside the dough.\r\nSometimes too one or other of the baking powders above described are\r\nadded to the flour by the miller, the product being sold as self-rising\r\nflour. Such flour will of course lose its property of self-rising if\r\nallowed to get damp. Occasionally objectionable substances are used in\r\nmaking baking powders of self-rising flours. Some baking powders for\r\ninstance contain alum which is not a desirable addition to any article\r\nof human food. Baking powders and self-rising flours are far more\r\nfrequently used by house-wives for making pastry or for other kinds of\r\ndomestic cookery than for breadmaking.\r\n\r\nBread is made on the large scale without the intervention of yeast\r\nby the aeration process, which is carried out as follows. A small\r\nquantity of malt is allowed to soak in a large quantity of water, and\r\nthe solution thus obtained is kept warm so that it may ferment. This\r\ncharges the solution with gas and at the same time produces other\r\nsubstances which are supposed to give the bread a good flavour. Such a\r\nsolution too retains gas much better than pure water. This solution is\r\nthen mixed with a proper proportion of flour inside a closed vessel,\r\ncarbon dioxide gas made by the action of acid on a carbonate being\r\npumped into the vessel whilst the mixing is in progress. The mixing\r\nis of course effected by mechanical means. As soon as the dough is\r\nsufficiently mixed, it is allowed to escape by opening a large tap\r\nat the bottom of the mixing vessel. This it does quite readily being\r\nforced out by the pressure of gas inside. As it comes out portions of\r\nsuitable size to make a loaf are cut off. These are at once moulded\r\ninto loaves and put into the oven. The gas which they contain expands,\r\nand light well risen bread is produced. This process is especially\r\nsuited for wholemeal and other flours containing much offal, which\r\napparently do not give the best results when submitted to the ordinary\r\nyeast fermentation.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter it may be of interest to add a short\r\naccount of the sale of bread. Bread is at the present time nominally\r\nsold by weight under acts of Parliament passed about 80 years ago.\r\nThat is to say, a seller of bread must provide in his shop scales and\r\nweights which will enable him to weigh the loaves he sells. No doubt\r\nhe would be prepared to do so if requested by a customer, in which\r\ncase he would probably make up any deficiency in weight which might be\r\nfound by adding as a makeweight a slice from another loaf. For this\r\npurpose it is commonly accepted that the ordinary loaf should weigh two\r\npounds. But in practice this does not occur, for practically the whole\r\nof the bread which is sold in this country is sold from the baker’s\r\ncart, which delivers bread at the houses of customers, and not over\r\nthe counter. Customers obviously cannot be expected to wait at their\r\ndoors whilst the man in the cart weighs each loaf he is delivering\r\nto them. In actual practice therefore the bread acts, as they are\r\ncalled, are really a dead letter, and bread is sold by the loaf and\r\nnot by weight, though it must be remembered that the loaf has the\r\nreputed weight of two pounds. There are no doubt slight variations\r\nfrom this weight, but for all practical purposes competition nowadays\r\nis quite as effective a check on the _bona fides_ of the bread seller\r\nas enforced sale by weight would be likely to be. If a baker got the\r\nreputation of selling loaves appreciably under weight his custom would\r\nvery soon be transferred to one of his more scrupulous competitors.\r\nAltogether it may be concluded that the present unregulated method of\r\nsale does not work to the serious disadvantage of the consumers. A\r\nlittle consideration will show that the sale of bread could only be put\r\non a more scientific basis by the exercise of an enormous amount of\r\ntrouble, and the employment of a very numerous and expensive staff. No\r\ndoubt the ideally perfect way of regulating the sale of either bread\r\nor any other feeding stuff would be to enact that it should be sold by\r\nweight, and that the seller should be compelled to state the percentage\r\ncomposition, so that the buyer could calculate the price he was asked\r\nto pay per unit of actual foodstuff. Now bread normally contains 36\r\nper cent. of water, but this amount varies greatly. A two pound loaf\r\nkept in a dry place may easily lose water by evaporation at the rate of\r\nmore than an ounce a day. The baker usually weighs out 2 lbs. 3 ozs.\r\nof dough to make each two pound loaf, and this amount yields a loaf\r\nwhich weighs in most cases fully two pounds soon after it comes out\r\nof the oven. But if the weather is hot and dry such a loaf may very\r\nwell weigh less than two pounds by the time it is delivered to the\r\nconsumer. In other words the baker cannot have the weight of the loaves\r\nhe sells under complete control. Furthermore the loss in weight when a\r\nloaf gets dry by evaporation is due entirely to loss of water, and does\r\nnot decrease the amount of actual foodstuff in the loaf. To sell bread\r\nin loaves guaranteed to contain a definite weight of actual foodstuff\r\nmight be justified scientifically, but practically it would entail\r\nso great an expense for the salaries of the inspectors and analysts\r\nrequired to enforce such a regulation that the idea is quite out of\r\nthe question. Practically, therefore, the situation is that it would\r\nbe unfair to enforce sale by weight pure and simple for the weight of\r\na loaf varies according to circumstances which are outside the baker’s\r\ncontrol, and further because the weight of the loaf is no guarantee of\r\nthe weight of foodstuff present in it. Nor is it possible to enforce\r\nsale by guarantee of the weight of foodstuff in the loaf, for to do\r\nso would be too troublesome and expensive. Finally the keenness of\r\ncompetition in the baking trade may be relied on to keep an efficient\r\ncheck on the interests of the consumer. Quite recently an important\r\npublic authority has published the results of weighing several\r\nthousand loaves of bread purchased within its area of administration.\r\nThe results show that over half the two pound loaves purchased\r\nwere under weight to the extent of five per cent. on the average.\r\nLegislation is understood to be suggested as the result of this report,\r\nin which case it is to be hoped that account will be taken of the fact\r\nthat the food value of a loaf depends not only on its weight but also\r\non the percentage of foodstuffs and water which it contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF BREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nBread is a substance which is made in so many ways that it is quite\r\nuseless to attempt to give average figures showing its composition. It\r\nwill suffice for the present to assume a certain composition which is\r\nprobably not far from the truth. This will serve for a basis on which\r\nto discuss certain generalities as to the food-value of bread. The\r\ncauses which produce variation in composition will be discussed later,\r\ntogether with their effect on the food value as far as information is\r\navailable. The following table shows approximately the composition of\r\nordinary white bread as purchased by most of the population of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n                              per cent.\r\n\r\n  Water                          36\r\n\r\n  Organic substances:\r\n      Proteins         10\r\n      Starch           42\r\n      Sugar, etc.      10\r\n      Fat               1\r\n      Fibre              ·3      63·3\r\n\r\n  Ash:\r\n      Phosphoric acid    ·2\r\n      Lime, etc.         ·5        ·7\r\n                               ------\r\n                                100·0\r\n\r\nThe above table shows that one of the most abundant constituents of\r\nordinary bread is water. Flour as commonly used for baking, although it\r\nmay look and feel quite dry, is by no means free from water. It holds\r\non the average about one-seventh of its own weight or 14 per cent. In\r\naddition to this rather over one-third of its weight of water or about\r\n35 to 40 per cent. is commonly required to convert ordinary flour into\r\ndough. It follows from this that dough will contain when first it is\r\nmixed somewhere about one-half its weight of water or 50 per cent.\r\nAbout four per cent. of the weight of the dough is lost in the form\r\nof water by evaporation during the fermentation of the dough before\r\nit is scaled and moulded. Usually 2 lb. 3 oz. of dough will make a\r\ntwo pound loaf, so that about three ounces of water are evaporated in\r\nthe oven, This is about one-tenth the weight of the dough or 10 per\r\ncent. Together with the four per cent. loss by evaporation during the\r\nfermenting period, this makes a loss of water of about 14 per cent.,\r\nwhich, when subtracted from the 50 per cent. originally present in the\r\ndough, leaves about 36 per cent. of water in the bread. As pointed out\r\nin the previous chapter this quantity is by no means constant even in\r\nthe same loaf. It varies from hour to hour, falling rapidly if the loaf\r\nis kept in a dry place.\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the organic constituents. The most important of these\r\nfrom the point of view of quantity is starch, in fact this is the\r\nmost abundant constituent of ordinary bread. Nor is it in bread only\r\nthat starch is abundant. It occurs to the extent of from 50 to 70 per\r\ncent. in all the cereals, grains, wheat, barley, oats, maize, and\r\nrice. Potatoes too contain about 20 per cent. of starch, in fact it\r\nis present in most plants. Starch is a white substance which does not\r\ndissolve in cold water, but when boiled in water swells up and makes,\r\na paste, which becomes thick and semisolid on cooling. It is this\r\nproperty which makes starch valuable in the laundry. Starch is composed\r\nof the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. When heated\r\nin the air it will burn and give out heat, but it does not do so as\r\nreadily as does fat or oil. It is this property of burning and giving\r\nout heat which makes starch valuable as a foodstuff. When eaten in the\r\nform of bread, or other article of food, it is first transformed by\r\nthe digestive juices of the mouth and intestine into sugar, which is\r\nthen absorbed from the intestine into the blood, and thus distributed\r\nto the working parts of the body. Here it is oxidized, not with the\r\nvisible flame which is usually associated with burning, but gradually\r\nand slowly, and with the formation of heat. Some of this heat is\r\nrequired to keep up the temperature of the body. The rest is available\r\nfor providing the energy necessary to carry on the movements required\r\nto keep the body alive and in health. Practically speaking therefore\r\nstarch in the diet plays the same part as fuel in the steam engine. The\r\nfood value of starch can in fact be measured in terms of the quantity\r\nof heat which a known weight of it can give out on burning. This is\r\ndone by burning a small pellet of starch in a bomb of compressed\r\noxygen immersed in a measured volume of water. By means of a delicate\r\nthermometer the rise of temperature of the water is measured, and it\r\nis thus found that one kilogram of starch on burning gives out enough\r\nheat to warm 4·1 kilograms of water through one degree. The quantity of\r\nheat which warms one kilogram of water through one degree is called one\r\nunit of heat or calorie, and the amount of heat given out by burning\r\none kilogram of any substance is called its heat of combustion or\r\nfuel-value. Thus the heat of combustion or fuel-value of starch is 4·1\r\ncalories.\r\n\r\nSugar has much the same food-value as starch, in fact starch is readily\r\nchanged into sugar by the digestive juices of the alimentary canal or\r\nby the ferments formed in germinating seeds. From the point of view\r\nof food-value sugar may be regarded as digested starch. Like starch,\r\nsugar is composed of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Like\r\nstarch too its value in nutrition is determined by the amount of heat\r\nit can give out on burning, and again its heat of combustion or fuel\r\nvalue 3·9 calories is almost the same as that of starch. It will be\r\nnoted that the whole of the 10 per cent. quoted in the table as sugar,\r\netc., is not sugar. Some of it is a substance called dextrin which is\r\nformed from starch by the excessive heat which falls on the outside of\r\nthe loaf in the oven. Starch is readily converted by heat into dextrin,\r\nand this fact is applied in many technical processes. For instance much\r\nof the gum used in the arts is made by heating starch. The outside\r\nof the loaf in the oven gets hot enough for some of the starch to be\r\nconverted into dextrin. Dextrin is soluble in water like sugar and so\r\nappears with sugar in the analyses of bread. From the point of view of\r\nfood-value this is of no consequence, as dextrin and sugar serve the\r\nsame purpose in nutrition, and have almost the same value as each other\r\nand as starch.\r\n\r\nBread always contains a little fat, not as a rule more that one or two\r\nper cent. But although the quantity is small it cannot be neglected\r\nfrom the dietetic point of view. Fat is composed of the same elements\r\nas starch, dextrin, and sugar, but in different proportions. It\r\ncontains far less oxygen than these substances. Consequently it burns\r\nmuch more readily and gives out much more heat in the process. The heat\r\nof combustion or fuel value of fat is 9·3 calories or 2·3 times greater\r\nthan that of starch. Evidently therefore even a small percentage of\r\nfat must materially increase the fuel value of any article of food.\r\nBut fat has an important bearing on the nutritive value of bread from\r\nquite another point of view. In the wheat grain the fat is concentrated\r\nin the germ, comparatively little being present in the inner portion\r\nof the grain. Thus the percentage of fat in any kind of bread is on\r\nthe whole a very fair indication of the amount of germ which has been\r\nleft in the flour from which the loaf was made. It is often contended\r\nnowadays that the germ contains an unknown constituent which plays an\r\nimportant part in nutrition, quite apart from its fuel-value. On this\r\nsupposition the presence of much fat in a sample of bread indicates the\r\npresence of much germ, and presumably therefore much of this mysterious\r\nconstituent which is supposed to endow such bread with a special value\r\nin the nutrition particularly of young children. This question will be\r\ndiscussed carefully in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nWhite bread contains a very small percentage of what is called by\r\nanalysts fibre. The quantity of this substance in a food is estimated\r\nby the analyst by weighing the residue which remains undigested when a\r\nknown weight of the food is submitted to a series of chemical processes\r\ndesigned to imitate as closely as may be the action of the various\r\ndigestive juices of the alimentary canal. Theoretically, therefore,\r\nit is intended to represent the amount of indigestible matter present\r\nin the food in question. Practically it does not achieve this result\r\nfor some of it undoubtedly disappears during the passage of the\r\nfood through the body. It is doubtful however if the portion which\r\ndisappears has any definite nutritive value. That part of the fibre\r\nwhich escapes digestion and is voided in the excrement cannot possibly\r\ncontribute to the nutrition of the body. Nevertheless it exerts a\r\ncertain effect on the well-being of the consumer, for the presence of\r\na certain amount of indigestible material stimulates the lower part of\r\nthe large intestine and thus conduces to regularity in the excretion\r\nof waste matters, a fact of considerable importance in many cases.\r\nThe amount of fibre is an index of the amount of indigestible matter\r\nin a food. In white bread it is small. In brown breads which contain\r\nconsiderable quantities of the husk of the wheat grain it may be\r\npresent to the extent of two or three per cent. Such breads therefore\r\nwill contain much indigestible matter, but they will possess laxative\r\nproperties which make them valuable in some cases.\r\n\r\nWe have left to the last the two constituents which at the present time\r\npossess perhaps the greatest interest and importance, the proteins\r\nand the ash. The proteins of bread consist of several substances, the\r\ndifferences between which, for the present purpose, may be neglected,\r\nand we may assume that for all practical purposes the proteins of bread\r\nconsist of one substance only, namely gluten. The importance of gluten\r\nin conferring on wheat flour the property of making light spongy loaves\r\nhas already been insisted upon. No doubt this property of gluten has a\r\ncertain indirect bearing on the nutritive value of bread by increasing\r\nits palatability. But gluten being a protein has a direct and special\r\npart to play in nutrition, which is perhaps best illustrated by\r\nfollowing one step further the comparison between the animal body and\r\na steam engine. It has been pointed out that starch, sugar, and fat\r\nplay the same part in the body as does the fuel in a steam engine. But\r\nan engine cannot continue running very long on fuel alone. Its working\r\nparts require renewing as they wear away, and coal is no use for this\r\npurpose. Metal parts must be renewed with metal. In much the same way\r\nthe working parts of the animal body wear away, and must be renewed\r\nwith the stuff of which they are made. Now the muscles, nerves, glands\r\nand other working parts of the body are made of protein, and they can\r\nonly be renewed with protein. Consequently protein must be supplied in\r\nthe diet in amount sufficient to make good from day to day the wear and\r\ntear of the working parts of the body. It is for this reason that the\r\nprotein of bread possesses special interest and importance.\r\n\r\nProtein like starch, sugar, and fat contains the elements carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen, but it differs from them in containing also\r\na large proportion of the element nitrogen, which may be regarded\r\nas its characteristic constituent. When digested in the stomach and\r\nintestine it is split into a large number of simpler substances known\r\nby chemists under the name of amino-acids. Every animal requires these\r\namino-acids in certain proportions. From the mixture resulting from\r\nthe digestion of the proteins in its diet the amino-acids are absorbed\r\nand utilised by the body in the proportions required. If the proteins\r\nof the diet do not supply the amino-acids in these proportions, it is\r\nobvious that an excessive amount of protein must be provided in order\r\nthat the diet may supply enough of that particular amino-acid which\r\nis present in deficient amount, and much of those amino-acids which\r\nare abundantly present must go to waste. This is undesirable for\r\ntwo reasons. Waste amino-acids are excreted through the kidneys, and\r\nexcessive waste throws excessive work on these organs, which may lead\r\nto defective excretion, and thus cause one or other of the numerous\r\nforms of ill health which are associated with this condition. Again,\r\nexcessive consumption of protein greatly adds to the cost of the diet,\r\nfor protein costs nearly as many shillings per pound as starch or sugar\r\ncosts pence.\r\n\r\nThese considerations show clearly the wisdom of limiting the amount\r\nof protein in the diet to the smallest amount which will provide for\r\nwear and tear of the working parts. The obvious way to do this is to\r\ntake a mixed diet so arranged that the various articles of which the\r\ndiet consists contain proteins which are so to speak complementary.\r\nThe meaning of this is perhaps best illustrated by a concrete example.\r\nThe protein of wheat, gluten, is a peculiar one. On digestion it\r\nsplits like other proteins into amino-acids, but these are not present\r\nfrom the dietetic point of view in well balanced proportions. One\r\nparticular amino-acid, called glutaminic acid, preponderates, and\r\nunfortunately this particular acid does not happen to be one which the\r\nanimal organism requires in considerable quantity. Other amino-acids\r\nwhich the animal organism does require in large amounts are deficient\r\nin the mixture of amino-acids yielded by the digestion of the protein\r\nof wheat. It follows, therefore, that to obtain enough of these latter\r\nacids a man feeding only on wheat products would have to eat a quantity\r\nof bread which would supply a great excess of the more abundant\r\nglutaminic acid, which would go to waste with the evil results already\r\noutlined. From this point of view it appears that bread should not\r\nform more than a certain proportion of the diet, and that the rest of\r\nthe diet should consist of foods which contain proteins yielding on\r\ndigestion little glutaminic acid and much of the other amino-acids in\r\nwhich the protein of wheat is deficient. Unfortunately information\r\nas to the exact amount of the different amino-acids yielded by the\r\ndigestion of the proteins even of many of the common articles of food\r\nis not available. But many workers are investigating these matters, and\r\nthe next great advance in the science of dietetics will probably come\r\nalong these lines. By almost universal custom certain articles of food\r\nare commonly eaten in association: bread and cheese, eggs and bacon,\r\nare instances. Such customs are usually found to be based on some\r\nunderlying principle. The principle in this case may well be that of\r\ncomplementary proteins.\r\n\r\nThe remarks which have been made above on the subject of the _rôle_\r\nof protein in the animal economy apply to adults in which protein\r\nis required for wear and tear only and not for increase in weight.\r\nThey will obviously apply with greatly increased force to the case of\r\ngrowing children, who require protein not only for wear and tear, but\r\nfor the building up of their muscles and other working parts as they\r\ngrow and develope. Consequently the diet of children should contain\r\nmore protein in proportion to their size than that of adults. For\r\nthis reason it is not desirable that bread should form an excessive\r\nproportion of their diet. The bread they eat should be supplemented\r\nwith some other food richer in protein.\r\n\r\nThe ash of bread although so small in amount cannot be ignored, in\r\nfact it is regarded as of very great importance by modern students\r\nof dietetics. The particular constituent of the ash to which most\r\nimportance is attached is phosphoric acid. This substance is a\r\nnecessary constituent of the bones and of the brain and nerves of all\r\nanimals. It exists too in smaller proportions in other organs. Like\r\nother working parts of the body the bones and the nervous system are\r\nsubject to wear and tear, which must be replaced if the body is to\r\nremain in normal health. A certain daily supply of phosphoric acid is\r\nrequired for this purpose, and proportionally to their size more for\r\nchildren than for adults. Considerable difference of opinion as to the\r\nexact amount required is expressed by those who have investigated this\r\nquestion, nor is it even agreed whether all forms of phosphoric acid\r\nare of the same value. There is however a general recognition of the\r\nimportance of this constituent of the diet, and the subject is under\r\ninvestigation in many quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCONCERNING DIFFERENT KINDS OF BREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table given in the last chapter states the average composition\r\nof ordinary white bread baked in the form of cottage loaves, and the\r\nremarks on the various constituents of bread in the preceding pages\r\nhave for the most part referred to the same material, though many of\r\nthem may be taken to refer to bread in general. It will now be of\r\ninterest to inquire as to the variation in composition which is found\r\namong the different kinds of bread commonly used in this country.\r\nThis enquiry will be most readily conducted by first considering the\r\npossible causes which may affect the composition of bread.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the composition of bread is a subject which is taken\r\nup from time to time by the public press, and debated therein with a\r\ngreat display of interest and some intelligent knowledge. In most of\r\nthe press discussions in the past interest has been focussed almost\r\nentirely on the effect of different kinds of milling. The attitude\r\ncommonly assumed by the food reform section of the contributors may be\r\nstated shortly as follows: In the days of stone milling a less perfect\r\nseparation of flour and bran was effected, and the flour contained\r\nmore of the materials situated in the grain near the husk than do the\r\nwhite flours produced by modern methods of roller milling. Again the\r\nmodern roller mills separate the germ from the flour, which the stone\r\nmills fail to do, at any rate so completely. Thus the stone ground\r\nflours contain about 80 per cent. of the grain, whilst the whole of the\r\nflour obtained from the modern roller mill seldom amounts to much more\r\nthan about 72 per cent. The extra eight per cent. of flour produced\r\nin the stone mills contains all or nearly all the germ and much of\r\nthe material rich in protein which lies immediately under the husk.\r\nHence the stone ground flour is richer in protein, and in certain\r\nconstituents of the germ, than white roller mill flour, and hence again\r\nstone ground flour has a higher nutritive value. Roller mill flour has\r\nnothing to commend it beyond its whiteness. It has been suggested that\r\nmillers should adopt the standard custom of producing 80 per cent. of\r\nflour from all the wheat passing through their mills and thus retain\r\nthose constituents of the grain which possess specially great nutritive\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be extremely difficult to produce 80 per cent. of\r\nflour from many kinds of wheat, but for the present this point may\r\nbe ignored, whilst we discuss the variation in the actual chemical\r\ncomposition of the flour produced as at present and on the 80 per cent.\r\nbasis. In comparing the chemical composition of different kinds of\r\nflour it is obvious that the flours compared must have been made from\r\nthe same lot of wheat, for as will be seen later different wheats vary\r\ngreatly in the proportions of protein and other important constituents\r\nwhich they contain. Unfortunately the number of analyses of different\r\nflours made from the same lots of wheat is small. Perhaps the best\r\nseries is that published by Dr Hamill in a recent report of the Local\r\nGovernment Board. Dr Hamill gives the analyses of five different grades\r\nof flour made at seven mills, each mill using the same blend of wheats\r\nfor all the different kinds of flour. Calculating all these analyses\r\nto a basis of 10 per cent. of protein in the grade of flour known as\r\npatents, the figures on the opposite page were obtained, which may be\r\ntaken to represent with considerable accuracy the average composition\r\nof the various kinds of flours and offals when made from the same wheat.\r\n\r\n            Description of flour        Protein  Phosphoric acid\r\n                  or offal             per cent.    per cent.\r\n\r\n  Flours:\r\n      Patents                             10·0        0·18\r\n      Straight grade, about 70 per cent.  10·6        0·21\r\n      Households                          10·9        0·26\r\n      Standard flour, about 80 per cent.  11·0        0·35\r\n      Wholemeal                           11·3        0·73\r\n\r\n  Offals:\r\n      Germ                                24·0        2·22\r\n      Sharps                              14·5        1·66\r\n      Bran                                13·5        2·50\r\n\r\nAccepting these figures as showing the relative proportions of protein\r\nand phosphoric acid in different flours as affected by milling only,\r\nother sources of variation having been eliminated by the use of the\r\nsame blend of wheat, it appears that the flours of commercially higher\r\ngrade undoubtedly do contain somewhat less protein and phosphoric\r\nacid than lower grade or wholemeal flours. Taking the extreme cases\r\nof patents and wholemeal flours, the latter contains one-ninth more\r\nprotein and four times more phosphoric acid than the former, provided\r\nboth are derived from the same wheat.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, however, it generally happens that the higher\r\ngrade flours are made from a blend of wheats containing a considerable\r\nproportion of hard foreign wheats which are rich in nitrogen, whilst\r\nwholemeal and standard flours are usually made from home grown wheats\r\nwhich are relatively poor in nitrogen. From a number of analyses of\r\nforeign and home grown wheats it appears that the relative proportions\r\nof protein is about 12½ per cent. in the hard foreign wheats as\r\ncompared with 10 per cent. in home grown wheats. Thus the presence\r\nof a larger proportion of protein in the hard wheats used in the\r\nblend of wheat for making the higher grade flours must tend to reduce\r\nthe difference in protein content between say patents and wholemeal\r\nflours as met with in ordinary practice. Furthermore much of the bread\r\nconsumed by that part of the population to whom a few grams per day\r\nof protein is of real importance is, or should be, made, for reasons\r\nof economy, from households flour, and the disparity between this\r\ngrade of flour and wholemeal flour is much less than is the case with\r\npatents. It appears, therefore, on examining the facts, that there is\r\nno appreciable difference in the protein content of the ordinary white\r\nflours consumed by the poorer classes of the people and wholemeal flour\r\nor standard flour.\r\n\r\nIn the above paragraphs account has been taken only of the total amount\r\nof protein in the various kinds of bread and flour. It is obvious,\r\nhowever, that the total amount present is not the real index of\r\nfood-value. Only that portion of any article of diet which is digested\r\nin the alimentary canal can be absorbed into the blood and carried\r\nthereby to the tissues where it is required to make good wear and tear.\r\nThe real food-value must therefore depend not on the total amount of\r\nfoodstuff present but on the amount which is digestible. The proportion\r\nof protein which can be digested in the different kinds of bread\r\nhas been the subject of careful experiments in America, and lately\r\nin Cambridge. The method of experimenting is arduous and unpleasant.\r\nSeveral people must exist for a number of days on a diet consisting\r\nchiefly of the kind of bread under investigation, supplemented only by\r\nsmall quantities of food which are wholly digestible, such as milk,\r\nsugar and butter. During the experimental period the diet is weighed\r\nand its protein content estimated by analysis. The excreta are also\r\ncollected and their protein content estimated by analysis, so that\r\nthe amount of protein which escapes digestion can be ascertained.\r\nThe experiment is then repeated with the same individuals and the\r\nsame conditions in every way except that another kind of bread is\r\nsubstituted for the one used before. From the total amount of protein\r\nconsumed in each kind of bread the total amount of protein voided\r\nin the excreta is subtracted, and the difference gives the amount\r\nwhich has been digested and presumably utilised in the body. From\r\nthese figures it is easy to calculate the number of parts of protein\r\ndigested for every 100 parts of protein eaten in each kind of bread.\r\nThis description will have made evident the unpleasant nature of such\r\nexperimental work. Its laboriousness will be understood from the fact\r\nthat a series of experiments of this kind carried out at Cambridge last\r\nwinter necessitated four people existing for a month on the meagre\r\ndiet above mentioned, and entailed over 1000 chemical analyses.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the amounts of protein digested per 100 parts\r\nof protein consumed in bread made from various kinds of flour, as based\r\non the average of a number of experiments made in America, and in the\r\nexperiments at Cambridge above referred to.\r\n\r\n  Kind of flour from  Percentage of  Amount of protein digested\r\n     which bread        the grain      per 100 parts eaten\r\n      was made        contained in    American    Cambridge\r\n                        the flour   experiments  experiments\r\n\r\n  Patents                36              --          89\r\n  Straight grade         70              89          --\r\n  Standard               80              81          86\r\n  Brown                  88              --          80\r\n  Brown                  92              --          77\r\n  Wholemeal             100              76          --\r\n\r\nThe American and the Cambridge figures agree very well with each other,\r\nand this gives confidence in the reliability of the results. It appears\r\nto be quite certain therefore that the protein in bread made from the\r\nhigher grade flours is very considerably more digestible than that\r\ncontained in bread made from flours containing greater amounts of husk.\r\nThe percentages following the names of the various grades of flour in\r\nthe first column of the table indicate approximately the proportion\r\nof the whole grain which went into the flour to which the figure is\r\nattached. Looking down these figures it appears that the digestibility\r\nof the protein decreases as more and more of the grain is included in\r\nthe flour. It follows, therefore, that whilst by leaving more and more\r\nof the grain in the flour we increase the percentage of protein in the\r\nflour, and consequently in the bread, at the same time we decrease\r\nthe digestibility of the protein. Apparently, too, this decrease in\r\ndigestibility is proportionally greater than the increase in protein\r\ncontent, and it follows therefore that breads made from low grade\r\nflours containing much husk will supply less protein which is available\r\nfor the use of the body, although they may actually contain slightly\r\nmore total protein than the flours of higher grade.\r\n\r\nWhen all the facts are taken into account it appears that the\r\ncontention of the food reformers, that the various breads which contain\r\nthose constituents of the grain which lie near the husk are capable of\r\nsupplying more protein for the needs of the body than white breads,\r\ncannot be upheld. From statistics collected by the Board of Trade some\r\nfew years ago as to the dietary of the working classes it appears that\r\nthe diet of workers both in urban and in rural districts contains\r\nabout 97 grams of total protein per head per day. This is rather under\r\nthan over the commonly accepted standard of 100 grams of protein which\r\nis supposed to be required daily by a healthy man at moderate work.\r\nConsequently a change in his diet which increased the amount of protein\r\nmight be expected to be a good change. But the suggested change of\r\nbrown bread for white, though it appears to increase the total protein,\r\nturns out on careful examination to fail in its object, for it does not\r\nincrease the amount of protein which can be digested.\r\n\r\nFrom the same statistics it appears that the diet of a working man\r\nincludes on the average about 1¼ lb. of bread per day. This amount of\r\nbread contains about 60 grams of protein, or two-thirds of the total\r\nprotein of the diet. Now it was pointed out in the last chapter that\r\nthe protein of wheat was very rich in glutaminic acid, a constituent\r\nof which animals require comparatively small amounts. It is also\r\ncorrespondingly poor in certain constituents which are necessary to\r\nanimals. Apparently therefore it would be better to increase the diet\r\nin such cases by adding some constituent not made from wheat than by\r\nchanging the kind of bread. From the protein point of view, however we\r\nlook at it, there appears to be no real reason for substituting one or\r\nother of the various kinds of brown bread for the white bread which\r\nseems to meet the taste of the present day public.\r\n\r\nBut important as protein is it is not everything in a diet. As we have\r\nalready pointed out the food must not only repair the tissues, it must\r\nalso supply fuel. It has been shown also that the fuel-value of a food\r\ncan be ascertained by burning a known weight and measuring the number\r\nof units of heat or calories produced. Many samples of bread have been\r\nexamined in this way in the laboratories of the American Department of\r\nAgriculture, and it appears from the figures given in their bulletins\r\nthat the average fuel value of white bread is about 1·250 calories per\r\npound, of wholemeal bread only 1·150 calories per pound. These figures\r\nare quite in accord with those which were obtained in Cambridge in\r\n1911, in connection with the digestion experiments already described,\r\nwhich were also extended so as to include a determination of the\r\nproportion of the energy of the bread which the diet supplied to the\r\nbody. The energy or fuel-value of the diet was determined by measuring\r\nthe amount of heat given out by burning a known weight of each of\r\nthe kinds of bread used in the experiment. The energy which was not\r\nutilised by the body was then determined by measuring how much heat was\r\ngiven out by burning the excreta corresponding to each kind of bread.\r\nThe following table gives side by side the average results obtained in\r\nseveral such experiments in America and in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe agreement between the two sets of figures is again on this point\r\nquite satisfactory. It is evident that a greater proportion of the\r\ntotal energy of white bread can be utilised by the body than is the\r\ncase with any of the breads made from flours of lower commercial grades\r\nwhich contain more husk. In fact it appears that the more of the outer\r\nparts of the grain are left in the flour the smaller is the proportion\r\nof the total energy of the bread which can be utilised. Combining this\r\nconclusion with the fact that brown breads contain on the average less\r\ntotal energy than white breads, there can be no doubt that white bread\r\nis considerably better than any form of brown bread as a source of\r\nenergy for the body.\r\n\r\n  Kind of flour from  Percentage of   Amount of energy utilised\r\n  which the bread      the grain       per 100 units in food\r\n      was made        contained in    American      Cambridge\r\n                       the flour    experiments   experiments\r\n  Patents                36             96             96\r\n  Straight grade         70             92             --\r\n  Standard               80             87             95\r\n  Brown                  88             --             90\r\n  Brown                  92             --             89\r\n  Wholemeal             100             82             --\r\n\r\nThere is one more important substance in respect of which great\r\nsuperiority is claimed for brown breads, namely phosphoric acid. From\r\nthe table on page 122 there can be no doubt that flours containing more\r\nof the outer parts of the grain are very much richer in phosphoric\r\nacid than white flours, and the disparity is so great that after\r\nallowing for the larger proportion of water in brown breads they\r\nmust contain far more of this substance than do white breads. In the\r\nCambridge digestibility experiments quoted above the proportion of the\r\nphosphoric acid digested from the different breads was determined. It\r\nwas found that for every 100 parts of phosphoric acid in white bread\r\nonly 52 parts were digested, and that in the case of the brown breads\r\nthis proportion fell to 41 parts out of 100. Again, as in the case of\r\nprotein and energy, the phosphoric acid in white bread is more readily\r\navailable to the body than that of brown bread, but in this case the\r\ndifference in digestibility is not nearly enough to counterbalance\r\nthe much larger proportion of phosphoric acid in the brown bread.\r\nThere is no doubt that the body gets more phosphoric acid from brown\r\nbread than from the same quantity of white bread. But before coming\r\nto any practical conclusion it is necessary to know two things, how\r\nmuch phosphoric acid does a healthy man require per day, and does his\r\nordinary diet supply enough?\r\n\r\nFrom the Board of Trade statistics already quoted it appears that,\r\non the assumption that the average worker eats white bread only, his\r\naverage diet contains 2·4 grams of phosphoric acid per day, which would\r\nbe raised to 3·2 grams if the white bread were replaced by bread made\r\nfrom 80 per cent. flour containing ·35 per cent. of phosphoric acid.\r\nInformation as to the amount of phosphoric acid required per day by\r\na healthy man is somewhat scanty, and indicates that the amount is\r\nvery variable, but averages about 2½ grams per day. If this is so,\r\nthe ordinary diet with white bread provides on the average enough\r\nphosphoric acid. Exceptional individuals may, however, be benefited by\r\nthe substitution of brown bread for white, but it would probably be\r\nbetter even in such cases, for the reasons stated when discussing the\r\nprotein question, to raise the phosphorus content of their diet by the\r\naddition of some substance rich in phosphorus but not made from wheat.\r\n\r\nFinally comes the question of the variation in the composition of\r\nbread due to the presence or absence of the germ. The first point in\r\nthis connection is to decide whether germ is present in appreciable\r\nproportions in any flour except wholemeal. The germ is a soft moist\r\nsubstance which flattens much more readily than it grinds. Consequently\r\nit is removed from flour by almost any kind of separation, even when\r\nvery coarse sieves are employed. If this contention is correct no flour\r\nexcept wholemeal should contain any appreciable quantity of germ, and\r\nit is certainly very difficult to demonstrate the presence of actual\r\ngerm particles even in 80 per cent. flour. Indirect evidence of the\r\npresence of germ may, however, be obtained as already explained by\r\nestimating by chemical analysis the proportion of fat present in\r\nvarious flours. The figures for such estimations are given by Dr Hamill\r\nin the report of the Local Government Board already referred to. They\r\nshow that the percentages of fat in different grades of flours made\r\nfrom the same blends of wheat are on the average of seven experiments\r\nas follows: patents flour ·96: household flours 1·25: 80 per cent.\r\nor standard flour 1·42. These figures show that the coarser flours\r\ncontaining more of the whole grain do contain more germ than the flours\r\nof commercially higher grade, in spite of the fact that it is difficult\r\nto demonstrate its presence under the microscope.\r\n\r\nRemembering, however, that the whole of the germ only amounts to about\r\n1½ per cent. of the grain, it is clear that the presence or absence of\r\nmore or less germ cannot appreciably affect the food-value as measured\r\nby protein content or energy-value. It is still open to contention that\r\nthe germ may contain some unknown constituent possessing a peculiar\r\neffect on nutrition. Such a state of things can well be imagined in the\r\nlight of certain experimental results which have been obtained during\r\nthe last few years.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown for instance by Dr Hopkins in Cambridge, and his\r\nresults have been confirmed at the Carnegie Institute in America, that\r\nyoung rats fail to thrive on a diet composed of suitable amounts of\r\npurified protein, fat, starch, and ash, but that they thrive and grow\r\nnormally on such a diet if there is added a trace of milk or other\r\nfresh animal or vegetable substance far too small to influence either\r\nthe protein content or the energy-value. Another case in point is the\r\ndiscovery that the disease known as beri beri, which is caused by a\r\ndiet consisting almost exclusively of rice from which the husk has been\r\nremoved, can be cured almost at once by the administration of very\r\nsmall doses of a constituent existing in minute quantities in rice\r\nhusk. The suggestion is that high grade flours, like polished rice, may\r\nfail to provide some substance which is necessary for healthy growth,\r\na substance which is removed in the germ or husk when such flours are\r\npurified, and which is present in flours which have not been submitted\r\nto excessive purification.\r\n\r\nThe answer is that no class in Great Britain lives on bread\r\nexclusively. Bread appears from the government statistics already\r\nquoted to form only about half the diet of the workers of the country.\r\nTheir diet includes also some milk, meat, and vegetables, and such\r\nsubstances, according to Dr Hopkins’ experiments, certainly contain the\r\nsubstance, whatever it may be, that is missing from the artificial diet\r\non which his young rats failed to thrive.\r\n\r\nOne last point. It will have been noticed in the figures given\r\nabove that the variations in protein content, digestibility, and\r\nenergy-value, between different kinds of bread are usually not\r\nvery large. There is, however, one constituent of all breads whose\r\nproportions vary far more widely, namely water. During last summer the\r\nauthor purchased many samples of bread in and around Cambridge, and\r\ndetermined the percentage of water in each sample. The samples were all\r\none day old so that they are comparable with one another. The results\r\non the whole are a little low, probably because the work was done\r\nduring a spell of rather dry weather, when the loaves would lose water\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe average figures are summarised below:\r\n\r\n                                           Percentage\r\n                                            of water\r\n\r\n  Cottage loaves made of white flour         31·7\r\n  Tinned loaves made of white flour          32·7\r\n  Small fancy loaves made of white flour     33·7\r\n  Tinned loaves made of “Standard” flour     35·9\r\n  Tinned loaves made of brown or germ flour  40·0\r\n\r\nThe figures speak for themselves. There must obviously be more actual\r\nfood in a cottage loaf of white flour containing under 32 per cent.\r\nof water than in any kind of Standard or brown loaf in which the\r\npercentage of water is 36 to 40. It is quite extraordinary that no one\r\nwho has organised any of the numerous bread campaigns in the press\r\nappears to have laid hold of the enormous variation in the water\r\ncontent of different kinds of bread, and its obvious bearing on their\r\nfood-value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader who wishes further information on any of the numerous\r\nsubjects connected with the growth, manipulation and composition of\r\nbreadstuffs is referred to the following publications, to which among\r\nothers the author is much indebted.
