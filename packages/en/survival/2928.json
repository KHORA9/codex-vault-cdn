Huxley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that that superficial film of the earth’s substance,\r\nhardly ten miles thick, which is accessible to human investigation, is\r\ncomposed for the most part of beds or strata of stone, the consolidated\r\nmuds and sands of former seas and lakes, which have been deposited one\r\nupon the other, and hence are the older the deeper they lie. These\r\nmultitudinous strata present such resemblances and differences among\r\nthemselves that they are capable of classification into groups or\r\nformations, and these formations again are brigaded together into still\r\nlarger assemblages, called by the older geologists, primary, secondary,\r\nand tertiary; by the moderns, palaeozoic, mesozoic, and cainozoic: the\r\nbasis of the former nomenclature being the relative age of the groups\r\nof strata; that of the latter, the kinds of living forms contained in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThough but a film if compared with the total diameter of our planet,\r\nthe total series of formations is vast indeed when measured by any\r\nhuman standard, and, as all action implies time, so are we compelled to\r\nregard these mineral masses as a measure of the time which has elapsed\r\nduring their accumulation. The amount of the time which they represent\r\nis, of course, in the inverse proportion of the intensity of the forces\r\nwhich have been in operation. If, in the ancient world, mud and sand\r\naccumulated on sea-bottoms at tenfold their present rate, it is clear\r\nthat a bed of mud or sand ten feet thick would have been formed then in\r\nthe same time as a stratum of similar materials one foot thick would be\r\nformed now, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his studies, therefore, the physical geologist had to\r\nchoose between two hypotheses; either, throughout the ages which are\r\nrepresented by the accumulated strata, and which we may call _geologic\r\ntime_, the forces of nature have operated with much the same average\r\nintensity as at present, and hence the lapse of time which they\r\nrepresent must be something prodigious and inconceivable, or, in the\r\nprimeval epochs, the natural powers were infinitely more intense than\r\nnow, and hence the time through which they acted to produce the effects\r\nwe see was comparatively short.\r\n\r\nThe earlier geologists adopted the latter view almost with one consent.\r\nFor they had little knowledge of the present workings of nature, and\r\nthey read the records of geologic time as a child reads the history of\r\nRome or Greece, and fancies that antiquity was grand, heroic, and\r\nunlike the present because it is unlike his little experience of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nEven so the earlier observers were moved with wonder at the seeming\r\ncontrast between the ancient and the present order of nature. The\r\nelemental forces seemed to have been grander and more energetic in\r\nprimeval times. Upheaved and contorted, rifted and fissured, pierced by\r\ndykes of molten matter or worn away over vast areas by aqueous action,\r\nthe older rocks appeared to bear witness to a state of things far\r\ndifferent from that exhibited by the peaceful epoch on which the lot of\r\nman has fallen.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees thoughtful students of geology have been led to perceive\r\nthat the earliest efforts of nature have been by no means the grandest.\r\nAlps and Andes are children of yesterday when compared with Snowdon and\r\nthe Cumberland hills; and the so-called glacial epoch—that in which\r\nperhaps the most extensive physical changes of which any record\r\nremaining occurred—is the last and the newest of the revolutions of the\r\nglobe. And in proportion as physical geography—which is the geology of\r\nour own epoch—has grown into a science, and the present order of nature\r\nhas been ransacked to find what, _hibernice_, we may call precedents\r\nfor the phenomena of the past, so the apparent necessity of supposing\r\nthe past to be widely different from the present has diminished.\r\n\r\nThe transporting power of the greatest deluge which can be imagined\r\nsinks into insignificance beside that of the slowly floating, slowly\r\nmelting iceberg, or the glacier creeping along at its snail’s pace of a\r\nyard a day. The study of the deltas of the Nile, the Ganges, and the\r\nMississippi has taught us how slow is the wearing action of water, how\r\nvast its effects when time is allowed for its operation. The reefs of\r\nthe Pacific, the deep-sea soundings of the Atlantic, show that it is to\r\nthe slow-growing coral and to the imperceptible animalcule, which lives\r\nits brief space and then adds its tiny shell to the muddy cairn left by\r\nits brethren and ancestors, that we must look as the agents in the\r\nformation of limestone and chalk, and not to hypothetical oceans\r\nsaturated with calcareous salts and suddenly depositing them.\r\n\r\nAnd while the inquirer has thus learnt that existing forces—_give them\r\ntime_—are competent to produce all the physical phenomena we meet with\r\nin the rocks, so, on the other side, the study of the marks left in the\r\nancient strata by past physical actions shows that these were similar\r\nto those which now obtain. Ancient beaches are met with whose pebbles\r\nare like those found on modern shores; the hardened sea-sands of the\r\noldest epochs show ripple-marks, such as may now be found on every\r\nsandy coast; nay, more, the pits left by ancient rain-drops prove that\r\neven in the very earliest ages, the “bow in the clouds” must have\r\nadorned the palaeozoic firmament. So that if we could reverse the\r\nlegend of the Seven Sleepers,—if we could sleep back through the past,\r\nand awake a million ages before our own epoch, in the midst of the\r\nearliest geologic times,—there is no reason to believe that sea, or\r\nsky, or the aspect of the land would warn us of the marvellous\r\nretrospection.\r\n\r\nSuch are the beliefs which modern physical geologists hold, or, at any\r\nrate, tend towards holding. But, in so doing, it is obvious that they\r\nby no means prejudge the question, as to what the physical condition of\r\nthe globe may have been before our chapters of its history begin, in\r\nwhat may be called (with that licence which is implied in the\r\noften-used term “prehistoric epoch”) “pre-geologic time.” The views\r\nindicated, in fact, are not only quite consistent with the hypothesis,\r\nthat, in the still earlier period referred to, the condition of our\r\nworld was very different; but they may be held by some to necessitate\r\nthat hypothesis. The physical philosopher who is accurately acquainted\r\nwith the velocity of a cannon-ball, and the precise character of the\r\nline which it traverses for a yard of its course, is necessitated by\r\nwhat he knows of the laws of nature to conclude that it came from a\r\ncertain spot, whence it was impelled by a certain force, and that it\r\nhas followed a certain trajectory. In like manner, the student of\r\nphysical geology, who fully believes in the uniformity of the general\r\ncondition of the earth through geologic time, may feel compelled by\r\nwhat he knows of causation, and by the general analogy of nature, to\r\nsuppose that our solar system was once a nebulous mass; that it\r\ngradually condensed, that it broke up into that wonderful group of\r\nharmoniously rolling balls we call planets and satellites, and that\r\nthen each of these underwent its appointed metamorphosis, until at last\r\nour own share of the cosmic vapour passed into that condition in which\r\nwe first meet with definite records of its state, and in which it has\r\nsince, with comparatively little change, remained.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of uniformity and the doctrine of progression are,\r\ntherefore, perfectly consistent; perhaps, indeed, they might be shown\r\nto be necessarily connected with one another.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the condition of the world, which has obtained throughout\r\ngeologic time, is but the sequel to a vast series of changes which took\r\nplace in pre-geologic time, then it seems not unlikely that the\r\nduration of this latter is to that of the former as the vast extent of\r\ngeologic time is to the length of the brief epoch we call the\r\nhistorical period; and that even the oldest rocks are records of an\r\nepoch almost infinitely remote from that which could have witnessed the\r\nfirst shaping of our globe.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no modern geologist would hesitate to admit the\r\ngeneral validity of these reasonings when applied to the physics of his\r\nsubject, whence it is the more remarkable that the moment the question\r\nchanges from one of physics and chemistry to one of natural history,\r\nscientific opinions and the popular prejudices, which reflect them in a\r\ndistorted form, undergo a sudden metamorphosis. Geologists and\r\npalaeontologists write about the “beginning of life” and the\r\n“first-created forms of living beings,” as if they were the most\r\nfamiliar things in the world; and even cautious writers seem to be on\r\nquite friendly terms with the “archetype” whereby the Creator was\r\nguided “amidst the crash of falling worlds.” Just as it used to be\r\nimagined that the ancient world was physically opposed to the present,\r\nso it is still widely assumed that the living population of our globe,\r\nwhether animal or vegetable, in the older epochs, exhibited forms so\r\nstrikingly contrasted with those which we see around us, that there is\r\nhardly anything in common between the two. It is constantly tacitly\r\nassumed that we have before us all the forms of life which have ever\r\nexisted; and though the progress of knowledge, yearly and almost\r\nmonthly, drives the defenders of that position from their ground, they\r\nentrench themselves in the new line of defences as if nothing had\r\nhappened, and proclaim that the _new_ beginning is the _real_\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nWithout for an instant denying or endeavouring to soften down the\r\nconsiderable positive differences (the negative ones are met by another\r\nline of argument) which undoubtedly obtain between the ancient and the\r\nmodern worlds of life, we believe they have been vastly overstated and\r\nexaggerated, and this belief is based upon certain facts whose value\r\ndoes not seem to have been fully appreciated, though they have long\r\nbeen more or less completely known.\r\n\r\nThe multitudinous kinds of animals and plants, both recent and fossil,\r\nare, as is well known, arranged by zoologists and botanists, in\r\naccordance with their natural relations, into groups which receive the\r\nnames of sub-kingdoms, classes, orders, families, genera and species.\r\nNow it is a most remarkable circumstance that, viewed on the great\r\nscale, living beings have differed so little throughout all geologic\r\ntime that there is no sub-kingdom and no class wholly extinct or\r\nwithout living representatives.\r\n\r\nIf we descend to the smaller groups, we find that the number of orders\r\nof plants is about two hundred; and I have it on the best authority\r\nthat not one of these is exclusively fossil; so that there is\r\nabsolutely not a single extinct ordinal type of vegetable life; and it\r\nis not until we descend to the next group, or the families, that we\r\nfind types which are wholly extinct. The number of orders of animals,\r\non the other hand, may be reckoned at a hundred and twenty, or\r\nthereabouts, and of these, eight or nine have no living\r\nrepresentatives. The proportion of extinct ordinal types of animals to\r\nthe existing types, therefore, does not exceed seven per cent.—a\r\nmarvellously small proportion when we consider the vastness of geologic\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnother class of considerations—of a different kind, it is true, but\r\ntending in the same direction—seems to have been overlooked. Not only\r\nis it true that the general plan of construction of animals and plants\r\nhas been the same in all recorded time as at present, but there are\r\nparticular kinds of animals and plants which have existed throughout\r\nvast epochs, sometimes through the whole range of recorded time, with\r\nvery little change. By reason of this persistency, the typical form of\r\nsuch a kind might be called a “persistent type,” in contradistinction\r\nto those types which have appeared for but a short time in the course\r\nof the world’s history. Examples of these persistent types are abundant\r\nenough in both the vegetable and the animal kingdoms. The oldest group\r\nof plants with which we are well acquainted is that of whose remains\r\ncoal is constituted; and as far as they can be identified, the\r\ncarboniferous plants are ferns, or club-mosses, or Coniferae, in many\r\ncases generically identical with those now living!\r\n\r\nAmong animals, instances of the same kind may be found in every\r\nsub-kingdom. The _Globigerina_ of the Atlantic soundings is identical\r\nwith that which occurs in the chalk; and the casts of lower silurian\r\n_Foraminifera_, which Ehrenberg has recently described, seem to\r\nindicate the existence at that remote period of forms singularly like\r\nthose which now exist. Among the corals, the palaeozoic _Tabulata_ are\r\nconstructed on precisely the same type as the modern millepores; and if\r\nwe turn to molluscs, the most competent malacologists fail to discover\r\nany generic distinction between the _Craniae_, _Lingulae_ and\r\n_Discinae_ of the silurian rocks and those which now live. Our existing\r\n_Nautilus_ has its representative species in every great formation,\r\nfrom the oldest to the newest; and _Loligo_, the squid of modern seas,\r\nappears in the lias, or at the bottom of the mesozoic series, in a\r\nform, at most, specifically different from its living congeners. In the\r\ngreat assemblage of annulose animals, the two highest classes, the\r\ninsects and spider tribe, exhibit a wonderful persistency of type. The\r\ncockroaches of the carboniferous epoch are exceedingly similar to those\r\nwhich now run about our coal-cellars; and its locusts, termites and\r\ndragon-flies are closely allied to the members of the same groups which\r\nnow chirrup about our fields, undermine our houses, or sail with swift\r\ngrace about the banks of our sedgy pools. And, in like manner, the\r\npalaeozoic scorpions can only be distinguished by the eye of a\r\nnaturalist from the modern ones.\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to the _Vertebrata_, the same law holds good:\r\ncertain types, such as those of the ganoid and placoid fishes, having\r\npersisted from the palaeozoic epoch to the present time without a\r\ngreater amount of deviation from the normal standard than that which is\r\nseen within the limits of the group as it now exists. Even among the\r\n_Reptilia_—the class which exhibits the largest proportion of entirely\r\nextinct forms of any one type,—that of the _Crocodilia_, has persisted\r\nfrom at least the commencement of the mesozoic epoch up to the present\r\ntime with so much constancy, that the amount of change which it\r\nexhibits may fairly, in relation to the time which has elapsed, be\r\ncalled insignificant. And the imperfect knowledge we have of the\r\nancient mammalian population of our earth leads to the belief that\r\ncertain of its types, such as that of the _Marsupialia_, have persisted\r\nwith correspondingly little change through a similar range of time.\r\n\r\nThus it would appear to be demonstrable, that, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat change which is exhibited by the animal population of the world\r\nas a whole, certain types have persisted comparatively without\r\nalteration, and the question arises, What bearing have such facts as\r\nthese on our notions of the history of life through geological time?\r\nThe answer to this question would seem to depend on the view we take\r\nrespecting the origin of species in general. If we assume that every\r\nspecies of animal and of plant was formed by a distinct act of creative\r\npower, and if the species which have incessantly succeeded one another\r\nwere placed upon the globe by these separate acts, then the existence\r\nof persistent types is simply an unintelligible irregularity. Such\r\nassumption, however, is as unsupported by tradition or by Revelation as\r\nit is opposed by the analogy of the rest of the operations of nature;\r\nand those who imagine that, by adopting any such hypothesis, they are\r\nstrengthening the hands of the advocates of the letter of the Mosaic\r\naccount, are simply mistaken. If, on the other hand, we adopt that\r\nhypothesis to which alone the study of physiology lends any\r\nsupport—that hypothesis which, having struggled beyond the reach of\r\nthose fatal supporters, the Telliameds and Vestigiarians, who so nearly\r\ncaused its suffocation by wind in early infancy, is now winning at\r\nleast the provisional assent of all the best thinkers of the day—the\r\nhypothesis that the forms or species of living beings, as we know them,\r\nhave been produced by the gradual modification of pre-existing\r\nspecies—then the existence of persistent types seems to teach us much.\r\nJust as a small portion of a great curve appears straight, the apparent\r\nabsence of change in direction of the line being the exponent of the\r\nvast extent of the whole, in proportion to the part we see; so, if it\r\nbe true that all living species are the result of the modification of\r\nother and simpler forms, the existence of these little altered\r\npersistent types, ranging through all geological time, must indicate\r\nthat they are but the final terms of an enormous series of\r\nmodifications, which had their being in the great lapse of pregeologic\r\ntime, and are now perhaps for ever lost.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when rightly studied, the teachings of palaeontology\r\nare at one with those of physical geology. Our farthest explorations\r\ncarry us back but a little way above the mouth of the great river of\r\nLife: where it arose, and by what channels the noble tide has reached\r\nthe point when it first breaks upon our view, is hidden from us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pages contain the substance of a lecture delivered before\r\nthe Royal Institution of Great Britain many months ago, and of course\r\nlong before the appearance of the remarkable work on the “Origin of\r\nSpecies” just published by Mr. Darwin, who arrives at very similar\r\nconclusions. Although, in one sense, I might fairly say that my own\r\nviews have been arrived at independently, I do not know that I can\r\nclaim any equitable right to property in them; for it has long been my\r\nprivilege to enjoy Mr. Darwin’s friendship, and to profit by\r\ncorresponding with him, and by, to some extent, becoming acquainted\r\nwith the workings of his singularly original and well-stored mind. It\r\nwas in consequence of my knowledge of the general tenor of the\r\nresearches in which Mr. Darwin had been so long engaged; because I had\r\nthe most complete confidence in his perseverance, his knowledge, and,\r\nabove all things, his high-minded love of truth; and, moreover, because\r\nI found that the better I became acquainted with the opinions of the\r\nbest naturalists regarding the vexed question of species, the less\r\nfixed they seemed to be, and the more inclined they were to the\r\nhypothesis of gradual modification, that I ventured to speak as\r\nstrongly as I have done in the final paragraphs of my discourse.\r\n\r\nThus, my daw having so many borrowed plumes, I see no impropriety in\r\nmaking a tail to this brief paper by taking another handful of feathers\r\nfrom Mr. Darwin; endeavouring to point out in a few words, in fact,\r\nwhat, as I gather from the perusal of his book, his doctrines really\r\nare, and on what sort of basis they rest. And I do this the more\r\nwillingly, as I observe that already the hastier sort of critics have\r\nbegun, not to review my friend’s book, but to howl over it in a manner\r\nwhich must tend greatly to distract the public mind.\r\n\r\nNo one will be better satisfied than I to see Mr. Darwin’s book\r\nrefuted, if any person be competent to perform that feat; but I would\r\nsuggest that refutation is retarded, not aided, by mere sarcastic\r\nmisrepresentation. Every one who has studied cattle-breeding, or turned\r\npigeon-fancier, or “pomologist,” must have been struck by the extreme\r\nmodifiability or plasticity of those kinds of animals and plants which\r\nhave been subjected to such artificial conditions as are imposed by\r\ndomestication. Breeds of dogs are more different from one another than\r\nare the dog and the wolf; and the purely artificial races of pigeons,\r\nif their origin were unknown, would most assuredly be reckoned by\r\nnaturalists as distinct species and even genera.\r\n\r\nThese breeds are always produced in the same way. The breeder selects a\r\npair, one or other, or both, of which present an indication of the\r\npeculiarity he wishes to perpetuate, and then selects from the\r\noffspring of them those which are most characteristic, rejecting the\r\nothers. From the selected offspring he breeds again, and, taking the\r\nsame precautions as before, repeats the process until he has obtained\r\nthe precise degree of divergence from the primitive type at which he\r\naimed.\r\n\r\nIf he now breeds from the variety thus established for some\r\ngenerations, taking care always to keep the stock pure, the tendency to\r\nproduce this particular variety becomes more and more strongly\r\nhereditary; and it does not appear that there is any limit to the\r\npersistency of the race thus developed.\r\n\r\nMen like Lamarck, apprehending these facts, and knowing that varieties\r\ncomparable to those produced by the breeder are abundantly found in\r\nnature, and finding it impossible to discriminate in some cases between\r\nvarieties and true species, could hardly fail to divine the possibility\r\nthat species even the most distinct were, after all, only exceedingly\r\npersistent varieties, and that they had arisen by the modification of\r\nsome common stock, just as it is with good reason believed that\r\nturnspits and greyhounds, carrier and tumbler pigeons, have arisen.\r\n\r\nBut there was a link wanting to complete the parallel. Where in nature\r\nwas the analogue of the breeder to be found? How could that operation\r\nof selection, which is his essential function, be carried out by mere\r\nnatural agencies? Lamarck did not value this problem; neither did he\r\nadmit his impotence to solve it; but he guessed a solution. Now,\r\nguessing in science is a very hazardous proceeding, and Lamarck’s\r\nreputation has suffered woefully for the absurdities into which his\r\nbaseless suppositions led him.\r\n\r\nLamarck’s conjectures, equipped with a new hat and stick, as Sir Walter\r\nScott was wont to say of an old story renovated, formed the foundation\r\nof the biological speculations of the “Vestiges,” a work which has done\r\nmore harm to the progress of sound thought on these matters than any\r\nthat could be named; and, indeed, I mention it here simply for the\r\npurpose of denying that it has anything in common with what essentially\r\ncharacterises Mr. Darwin’s work.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature of the latter is, in fact, that it professes to\r\ntell us what in nature takes the place of the breeder; what it is that\r\nfavours the development of one variety into which a species may run,\r\nand checks that of another; and, finally, shows how this natural\r\nselection, as it is termed, may be the physical cause of the production\r\nof species by modification.\r\n\r\nThat which takes the place of the breeder and selector in nature is\r\nDeath. In a most remarkable chapter, “On the Struggle for Existence,”\r\nMr. Darwin draws attention to the marvellous destruction of life which\r\nis constantly going on in nature. For every species of living thing, as\r\nfor man, “_Eine Bresche ist ein jeder Tag_.”—Every species has its\r\nenemies; every species has to compete with others for the necessaries\r\nof existence; the weakest goes to the wall, and death is the penalty\r\ninflicted on all laggards and stragglers. Every variety to which a\r\nspecies may give rise is either worse or better adapted to surrounding\r\ncircumstances than its parent. If worse, it cannot maintain itself\r\nagainst death, and speedily vanishes again. But if better adapted, it\r\nmust, sooner or later, “improve” its progenitor from the face of the\r\nearth, and take its place. If circumstances change, the victor will be\r\nsimilarly supplanted by its own progeny; and thus, by the operation of\r\nnatural causes, unlimited modification may in the lapse of long ages\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nFor an explanation of what I have here called vaguely “surrounding\r\ncircumstances,” and of why they continually change—for ample proof that\r\nthe “struggle for existence” is a very great reality, and assuredly\r\n_tends_ to exert the influence ascribed to it—I must refer to Mr.\r\nDarwin’s book. I believe I have stated fairly the position upon which\r\nhis whole theory must stand or fall; and it is not my purpose to\r\nanticipate a full review of his work. If it can be proved that the\r\nprocess of natural selection, operating upon any species, can give rise\r\nto varieties of species so different from one another that none of our\r\ntests will distinguish them from true species, Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis\r\nof the origin of species will take its place among the established\r\ntheories of science, be its consequences whatever they may. If, on the\r\nother hand, Mr. Darwin has erred, either in fact or in reasoning, his\r\nfellow-workers will soon find out the weak points in his doctrines, and\r\ntheir extinction by some nearer approximation to the truth will\r\nexemplify his own principle of natural selection.\r\n\r\nIn either case the question is one to be settled only by the\r\npainstaking, truth-loving investigation of skilled naturalists. It is\r\nthe duty of the general public to await the result in patience; and,\r\nabove all things, to discourage, as they would any other crimes, the\r\nattempt to enlist the prejudices of the ignorant, or the\r\nuncharitableness of the bigoted, on either side of the controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n * “Macmillan’s Magazine,” December 1859.",
