It has been the writer's purpose to select those\r\nseries of facts which serve to show the continuous operations of\r\nenergy, so that the reader might be helped to a truer conception of\r\nthe nature of this sphere than he can obtain from ordinary text-books.\r\n\r\nIn the usual method of presenting the elements of the earth's history\r\nthe facts are set forth in a manner which leads the student to\r\nconceive that history as in a way completed. The natural prepossession\r\nto the effect that the visible universe represents something done,\r\nrather than something endlessly doing, is thus re-enforced, with the\r\nresult that one may fail to gain the largest and most educative\r\nimpression which physical science can afford him in the sense of the\r\nswift and unending procession of events.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to all who are acquainted with the history of geology\r\nthat the static conception of the earth--the idea that its existing\r\ncondition is the finished product of forces no longer in action--led\r\nto prejudices which have long retarded, and indeed still retard, the\r\nprogress of that science. This fact indicates that at the outset of a\r\nstudent's work in this field he should be guarded against such\r\nmisconceptions. The only way to attain the end is by bringing to the\r\nunderstanding of the beginner a clear idea of successions of events\r\nwhich are caused by the forces operating in and on this sphere. Of all\r\nthe chapters of this great story, that which relates to the history of\r\nthe work done by the heat of the sun is the most interesting and\r\nawakening. Therefore an effort has been made to present the great\r\nsuccessive steps by which the solar energy acts in the processes of\r\nthe air and the waters.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the beginner in geology is sure to be aroused when he\r\ncomes to see how very far the history of the earth has influenced the\r\nfate of men. Therefore the aim has been, where possible, to show the\r\nways in which geological processes and results are related to\r\nourselves; how, in a word, this earth has been the well-appointed\r\nnursery of our kind.\r\n\r\nAll those who are engaged in teaching elementary science learn the\r\nneed of limiting the story they have to tell to those truths which can\r\nbe easily understood by beginners. It is sometimes best, as in stating\r\nsuch difficult matters as those concerning the tides, to give\r\nexplanations which are far from complete, and which, as to their mode\r\nof presentation, would be open to criticism were it not for the fact\r\nthat any more elaborate statements would most likely be\r\nincomprehensible to the novice, thus defeating the teacher's aim.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that no account is here given of the geological\r\nages or of the successions of organic life. Chapters on these subjects\r\nwere prepared, but were omitted for the reason that they made the\r\nstory too long, and also because they carried the reader into a field\r\nof much greater difficulty than that which is found in the physical\r\nhistory of the earth.\r\n\r\n                                                  N.S.S.\r\n_March, 1898._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n       I.--INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF NATURE                   1\r\n      II.--WAYS AND MEANS OF STUDYING NATURE                     9\r\n     III.--THE STELLAR REALM                                    31\r\n      IV.--THE EARTH                                            81\r\n       V.--THE ATMOSPHERE                                       97\r\n      VI.--GLACIERS                                            207\r\n     VII.--THE WORK OF UNDERGROUND WATER                       250\r\n    VIII.--THE SOIL                                            313\r\n      IX.--THE ROCKS AND THEIR ORDER                           349\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LIST OF FULL-PAGE ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n                                                        FACING PAGE\r\n\r\n    Dunes at Ipswich Light, Massachusetts            _Frontispiece_\r\n    Seal Rocks near San Francisco, California                   33\r\n    Lava stream, in Hawaiian Islands, flowing into the sea      72\r\n    Waterfall near Gadsden, Alabama                             90\r\n    South shore, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts              121\r\n    Pocket Creek, Cape Ann, Massachusetts                      163\r\n    Muir Glacier, Alaska                                       207\r\n    Front of Muir Glacier                                      240\r\n    Mount Ætna, seen from near Catania                         201\r\n    Mountain gorge, Himalayas, India                           330\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   OUTLINES OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n               AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is to give the student who is about to enter\r\non the study of natural science some general idea as to the conditions\r\nof the natural realm. As this field of inquiry is vast, it will be\r\npossible only to give the merest outline of its subject-matter, noting\r\nthose features alone which are of surpassing interest, which are\r\ndemanded for a large understanding of man's place in this world, or\r\nwhich pertain to his duties in life.\r\n\r\nIn entering on any field of inquiry, it is most desirable that the\r\nstudent should obtain some idea as to the ways in which men have been\r\nled to the knowledge which they possess concerning the world about\r\nthem. Therefore it will be well briefly to sketch the steps by which\r\nnatural science has come to be what it is. By so doing we shall\r\nperceive how much we owe to the students of other generations; and by\r\nnoting the difficulties which they encountered, and how they avoided\r\nthem, we shall more easily find our own way to knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe primitive savages, who were the ancestors of all men, however\r\ncivilized they may be, were students of Nature. The remnants of these\r\nlowly people who were left in different parts of the world show us\r\nthat man was not long in existence before he began to devise some\r\nexplanation concerning the course of events in the outer world.\r\nSeeing the sun rise and set, the changes of the moon, the alternation\r\nof the seasons, the incessant movement of the streams and sea, and the\r\nother more or less orderly successions of events, our primitive\r\nforefathers were driven to invent some explanation of them. This,\r\nindependently, and in many different times and places, they did in a\r\nsimple and natural way by supposing that the world was controlled by a\r\nhost of intelligent beings, each of which had some part in ordering\r\nmaterial things. Sometimes these invisible powers were believed to be\r\nthe spirits of great chieftains, who were active when on earth, and\r\nwho after death continued to exercise their power in the larger realms\r\nof Nature. Again, and perhaps more commonly, these movements of Nature\r\nwere supposed to be due to the action of great though invisible\r\nbeasts, much like those which the savage found about him. Thus among\r\nour North American Indians the winds are explained by the supposition\r\nthat the air is fanned by the wings of a great unseen bird, whose duty\r\nit is to set the atmosphere into motion. That no one has ever seen the\r\nbird doing the work, or that the task is too great for any conceivable\r\nbird, is to the simple, uncultivated man no objection to this view. It\r\nis long, indeed, before education brings men to the point where they\r\ncan criticise their first explanations of Nature.\r\n\r\nAs men in their advance come to see how much nobler are their own\r\nnatures than those of the lower animals, they gradually put aside the\r\nexplanation of events by the actions of beasts, and account for the\r\norder of the world by the supposition that each and every important\r\ndetail is controlled by some immortal creature essentially like a man,\r\nthough much more powerful than those of their own kind. This stage of\r\nunderstanding is perhaps best shown by the mythology of the Greeks,\r\nwhere there was a great god over all, very powerful but not\r\nomnipotent; and beneath him, in endless successions of command,\r\nsubordinate powers, each with a less range of duties and capacities\r\nthan those of higher estate, until at the bottom of the system there\r\nwere minor deities and demigods charged with the management of the\r\ntrees, the flowers, and the springs--creatures differing little from\r\nman, except that they were immortal, and generally invisible, though\r\nthey, like all the other deities, might at their will display\r\nthemselves to the human beings over whom they watched, and whose path\r\nin life they guided.\r\n\r\nAmong only one people do we find that the process of advance led\r\nbeyond this early and simple method of accounting for the processes of\r\nNature, bringing men to an understanding such as we now possess. This\r\ngreat task was accomplished by the Greeks alone. About twenty-five\r\nhundred years ago the philosophers of Greece began to perceive that\r\nthe early notion as to the guidance of the world by creatures\r\nessentially like men could not be accepted, and must be replaced by\r\nsome other view which would more effectively account for the facts.\r\nThis end they attained by steps which can not well be related here,\r\nbut which led them to suppose separate powers behind each of the\r\nnatural series--powers having no relation to the qualities of mankind,\r\nbut ever acting to a definite end. Thus Plato, who represents most\r\nclearly this advance in the interpretation of facts, imagined that\r\neach particular kind of plant or animal had its shape inevitably\r\ndetermined by something which he termed an idea, a shape-giving power\r\nwhich existed before the object was created, and which would remain\r\nafter it had been destroyed, ever ready again to bring matter to the\r\nparticular form. From this stage of understanding it was but a short\r\nstep to the modern view of natural law. This last important advance\r\nwas made by the great philosopher Aristotle, who, though he died about\r\ntwenty-two hundred years ago, deserves to be accounted the first and\r\nin many ways the greatest of the ancient men of science who were\r\ninformed with the modern spirit.\r\n\r\nWith Aristotle, as with all his intellectual successors, the\r\noperations of Nature were conceived as to be accounted for by the\r\naction of forces which we commonly designate as natural laws, of which\r\nperhaps the most familiar and universal is that of gravitation, which\r\nimpels all bodies to move toward each other with a degree of intensity\r\nwhich is measured by their weight and the distance by which they are\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries students used the term law in somewhat the same way\r\nas the more philosophical believers in polytheism spoke of their gods,\r\nor as Plato of the ideas which he conceived to control Nature. We see\r\nby this instance how hard it is to get rid of old ways of thinking.\r\nEven when the new have been adopted we very often find that something\r\nof the ancient and discarded notions cling in our phrases. The more\r\nadvanced of our modern philosophers are clear in their mind that all\r\nwe know as to the order of Nature is that, given certain conditions,\r\ncertain consequences inevitably follow.\r\n\r\nAlthough the limitations which modern men of science perceive to be\r\nput upon their labours may seem at first sight calculated to confine\r\nour understanding within a narrow field of things which can be seen,\r\nor in some way distinctly proved to exist, the effect of this\r\nlimitation has been to make science what it is--a realm of things\r\nknown as distinct from things which may be imagined. All the\r\ndifference between ancient science and modern consists in the fact\r\nthat in modern science inquirers demand a businesslike method in the\r\ninterpretation of Nature. Among the Greeks the philosopher who taught\r\nexplanations of any feature in the material world which interested him\r\nwas content if he could imagine some way which would account for the\r\nfacts. It is the modern custom now to term the supposition of an\r\nexplanation a _working hypothesis_, and only to give it the name of\r\ntheory after a very careful search has shown that all the facts which\r\ncan be gathered are in accordance with the view. Thus when Newton made\r\nhis great suggestion concerning the law of gravitation, which was to\r\nthe effect that all bodies attracted each other in proportion to\r\ntheir masses, and inversely as the square of their distance from each\r\nother, he did not rest content, as the old Greeks would have done,\r\nwith the probable truth of the explanation, but carefully explored the\r\nmovements of the planets and satellites of the solar system to see if\r\nthe facts accorded with the hypothesis. Even the perfect\r\ncorrespondence which he found did not entirely content inquirers, and\r\nin this century very important experiments have been made which have\r\nserved to show that a ball suspended in front of a precipice will be\r\nattracted toward the steep, and that even a mass of lead some tons in\r\nweight will attract toward itself a small body suspended in the manner\r\nof a pendulum.\r\n\r\nIt is this incessant revision of the facts, in order to see if they\r\naccord with the assumed rule or law, which has given modern science\r\nthe sound footing that it lacked in earlier days, and which has\r\npermitted our learning to go on step by step in a safe way up the\r\nheights to which it has climbed. All explanations of Nature begin with\r\nthe work of the imagination. In common phrase, they all are guesses\r\nwhich have at first but little value, and only attain importance in\r\nproportion as they are verified by long-continued criticism, which has\r\nfor its object to see whether the facts accord with the theory. It is\r\nin this effort to secure proof that modern science has gathered the\r\nenormous store of well-ascertained facts which constitutes its true\r\nwealth, and which distinguishes it from the earlier imaginative and to\r\na great extent unproved views.\r\n\r\nIn the original state of learning, natural science was confounded with\r\npolitical and social tradition, with the precepts of duty which\r\nconstitute the law of the people, as well as with their religion, the\r\nwhole being in the possession of the priests or wise men. So long as\r\nnatural action was supposed to be in the immediate control of numerous\r\ngods and demigods, so long, in a word, as the explanation of Nature\r\nwas what we term polytheistic, this association of science with other\r\nforms of learning was not only natural but inevitable. Gradually,\r\nhowever, as the conception of natural law replaced the earlier idea as\r\nto the intervention of a spirit, science departed from other forms of\r\nlore and came to possess a field to itself. At first it was one body\r\nof learning. The naturalists of Aristotle's time, and from his day\r\ndown to near our own, generally concerned themselves with the whole\r\nfield of Nature. For a time it was possible for any one able and\r\nlaborious man to know all which had been ascertained concerning\r\nastronomy, chemistry, geology, as well as the facts relating to living\r\nbeings. The more, however, as observation accumulated, and the store\r\nof facts increased, it became difficult for any one man to know the\r\nwhole. Hence it has come about that in our own time natural learning\r\nis divided into many distinct provinces, each of which demands a\r\nlifetime of labour from those who would know what has already been\r\ndone in the field, and what it is now important to do in the way of\r\nnew inquiries.\r\n\r\nThe large divisions which naturalists have usually made of their tasks\r\nrest in the main on the natural partitions which we may readily\r\nobserve in the phenomenal world. First of all comes astronomy,\r\nincluding the phenomena exhibited in the heavens, beyond the limits of\r\nthe earth's atmosphere. Second, geology, which takes account of all\r\nthose actions which in process of time have been developed in our own\r\nsphere. Third, physics, which is concerned with the laws of energy, or\r\nthose conditions which affect the motion of bodies, and the changes\r\nwhich are impressed upon them by the different natural forces. Fourth,\r\nchemistry, which seeks to interpret the principles which determine the\r\ncombination of atoms and the molecules which are built of them under\r\nthe influence of the chemical affinities. Fifth, biology, or the laws\r\nof life, a study which pertains to the forms and structures of animals\r\nand plants, and their wonderful successions in the history of the\r\nworld. Sixth, mathematics, or the science of space and number, that\r\ndeals with the principles which underlie the order of Nature as\r\nexpressed at once in the human understanding and in the material\r\nuniverse. By its use men were made able to calculate, as in\r\narithmetic, the problems which concern their ordinary business, as\r\nwell as to compute the movements of the celestial bodies, and a host\r\nof actions which take place on the earth that would be inexplicable\r\nexcept by the aid of this science. Last of all among the primary\r\nsciences we may name that of psychology, which takes account of mental\r\noperations among man and his lower kindred, the animals.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seven sciences above mentioned, which rest in a\r\ngreat measure on the natural divisions of phenomena, there are many,\r\nindeed, indefinitely numerous, subdivisions which have been made to\r\nsuit the convenience of students. Thus astronomy is often separated\r\ninto physical and mathematical divisions, which take account either of\r\nthe physical phenomena exhibited by the heavenly bodies or of their\r\nmotions. In geology there are half a dozen divisions relating to\r\nparticular branches of that subject. In the realm of organic life, in\r\nchemistry, and in physics there are many parts of these sciences which\r\nhave received particular names.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that these sciences have the independence of\r\neach other which their separate names would imply. In fact, the\r\nstudent of each, however, far he may succeed in separating his field\r\nfrom that of the other naturalists, as we may fitly term all students\r\nof Nature, is compelled from time to time to call in the aid of his\r\nbrethren who cultivate other branches of learning. The modern\r\nastronomer needs to know much of chemistry, or else he can not\r\nunderstand many of his observations on the sun. The geologists have to\r\nshare their work with the student of animal and vegetable life, with\r\nthe physicists; they must, moreover, know something of the celestial\r\nspheres in order to interpret the history of the earth. In fact, day\r\nby day, with the advance of learning, we come more clearly to\r\nperceive that all the processes of Nature are in a way related to each\r\nother, and that in proportion as we understand any part of the great\r\nmechanism, we are forced in a manner to comprehend the whole. In other\r\nwords, we are coming to understand that these divisions of the field\r\nof science depend upon the limitations of our knowledge, and not upon\r\nthe order of Nature itself. For the purposes of education it is\r\nimportant that every one should know something of the great truths\r\nwhich each science has disclosed. No mortal man can compass the whole\r\nrealm of this knowledge, but every one can gain some idea of the\r\nlarger truths which may help him to understand the beauty and grandeur\r\nof the sphere in which he dwells, which will enable him the better to\r\nmeet the ordinary duties of life, that in almost all cases are related\r\nto the facts of the world about us. It has been of late the custom to\r\nterm this body of general knowledge which takes account of the more\r\nevident facts and important series of terrestrial actions\r\nphysiography, or, as the term implies, a description of Nature, with\r\nthe understanding that the knowledge chosen for the account is that\r\nwhich most intimately concerns the student who seeks information that\r\nis at once general and important. Therefore, in this book the effort\r\nis made first to give an account as to the ways and means which have\r\nled to our understanding of scientific problems, the methods by which\r\neach person may make himself an inquirer, and the outline of the\r\nknowledge that has been gathered since men first began to observe and\r\ncriticise the revelations the universe may afford them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                  WAYS AND MEANS OF STUDYING NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the student of Nature keep well in mind the means\r\nwhereby he is able to perceive what goes on in the world about him. He\r\nshould understand something as to the nature of his senses, and the\r\nextent to which these capacities enable him to discern the operations\r\nof Nature. Man, in common with his lower kindred, is, by the mechanism\r\nof the body, provided with five somewhat different ways by which he\r\nmay learn something of the things about him. The simplest of these\r\ncapacities is that of touch, a faculty that is common to the general\r\nsurface of the body, and which informs us when the surface is affected\r\nby contact with some external object. It also enables us to discern\r\ndifferences of temperature. Next is the sense of taste, which is\r\nlimited to the mouth and the parts about it. This sense is in a way\r\nrelated to that of touch, for the reason that it depends on the\r\ncontact of our body with material things. Third is the sense of smell,\r\nso closely related to that of taste that it is difficult to draw the\r\nline between the two. Yet through the apparatus of the nose we can\r\nperceive the microscopically small parts of matter borne to us through\r\nthe air, which could not be appreciated by the nerves of the mouth.\r\nFourth in order of scope comes the hearing, which gives us an account\r\nof those waves of matter that we understand as sound. This power is\r\nmuch more far ranging than those before noted; in some cases, as in\r\nthat of the volcanic explosions from the island of Krakatoa, in the\r\neruption of 1883, the convulsions were audible at the distance of\r\nmore than a thousand miles away. The greater cannon of modern days may\r\nbe heard at the distance of more than a hundred miles, so that while\r\nthe sense of touch, taste, and smell demand contact with the bodies\r\nwhich we appreciate, hearing gives us information concerning objects\r\nat a considerable distance. Last and highest of the senses, vastly the\r\nmost important in all that relates to our understanding of Nature, is\r\nsight, or the capacity which enables us to appreciate the movement of\r\nthose very small waves of ether which constitute light. The eminent\r\npeculiarity of sight is that it may give us information concerning\r\nthings which are inconceivably far away; it enables us to discern the\r\nlight of suns probably millions of times as remote from us as is the\r\ncentre of our own solar system.\r\n\r\nAlthough much of the pleasure which the world affords us comes through\r\nthe other senses, the basis of almost all our accurate knowledge is\r\nreported by sight. It is true that what we have observed with our eyes\r\nmay be set forth in words, and thus find its way to the understanding\r\nthrough the ears; also that in many instances the sense of touch\r\nconveys information which extends our perceptions in many important\r\nways; but science rests practically on sight, and on the insight that\r\ncomes from the training of the mind which the eyes make possible.\r\n\r\nThe early inquirers had no resources except those their bodies\r\nafforded; but man is a tool-making creature, and in very early days he\r\nbegan to invent instruments which helped him in inquiry. The earliest\r\ndeliberate study was of the stars. Science began with astronomy, and\r\nthe first instruments which men contrived for the purpose of\r\ninvestigation were astronomical. In the beginning of this search the\r\nstars were studied in order to measure the length of the year, and\r\nalso for the reason that they were supposed in some way to control the\r\nfate of men. So far as we know, the first pieces of apparatus for this\r\npurpose were invented in Egypt, perhaps about four thousand years\r\nbefore the Christian era. These instruments were of a simple nature,\r\nfor the magnifying glass was not yet contrived, and so the telescope\r\nwas impossible. They consisted of arrangements of straight edges and\r\ndivided circles, so that the observers, by sighting along the\r\ninstruments, could in a rough way determine the changes in distance\r\nbetween certain stars, or the height of the sun above the horizon at\r\nthe various seasons of the year. It is likely that each of the great\r\npyramids of Egypt was at first used as an observatory, where the\r\npriests, who had some knowledge of astronomy, found a station for the\r\napparatus by which they made the observations that served as a basis\r\nfor casting the horoscope of the king.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of science and of the mechanical invention attending\r\nits growth, a great number of inventions have been contrived which\r\nvastly increase our vision and add inconceivably to the precision it\r\nmay attain. In fact, something like as much skill and labour has been\r\ngiven to the development of those inventions which add to our learning\r\nas to those which serve an immediate economic end. By far the greatest\r\nof these scientific inventions are those which depend upon the lens.\r\nBy combining shaped bits of glass so as to control the direction in\r\nwhich the light waves move through them, naturalists have been able to\r\ncreate the telescope, which in effect may bring distant objects some\r\nthousand times nearer to view than they are to the naked eye; and the\r\nmicroscope, which so enlarges minute objects as to make them visible,\r\nas they were not before. The result has been enormously to increase\r\nour power of vision when applied to distant or to small objects. In\r\nfact, for purposes of learning, it is safe to say that those tools\r\nhave altogether changed man's relation to the visible universe. The\r\nnaked eye can see at best in the part of the heavens visible from any\r\none point not more than thirty thousand stars. With the telescope\r\nsomewhere near a hundred million are brought within the limits of\r\nvision. Without the help of the microscope an object a thousandth of\r\nan inch in diameter appears as a mere point, the existence of which we\r\ncan determine only under favourable circumstances. With that\r\ninstrument the object may reveal an extended and complicated structure\r\nwhich it may require a vast labour for the observer fully to explore.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the aid of vision above noted come the\r\nscientific tools which are used in weighing and measuring. These\r\nbalances and gauges have attained such precision that intervals so\r\nsmall as to be quite invisible, and weights as slight as a\r\nten-thousandth of a grain, can be accurately measured. From these\r\ninstruments have come all those precise examinations on which the\r\naccuracy of modern science intimately depends. All these instruments\r\nof precision are the inventions of modern days. The simplest\r\ntelescopes were made only about two hundred and fifty years ago, and\r\nthe earlier compound microscopes at a yet later date. Accurate\r\nbalances and other forms of gauges of space, as well as good means of\r\ndividing time, such as our accurate astronomical clocks and\r\nchronometers, are only about a century old. The instruments have made\r\nscience accurate, and have immensely extended its powers in nearly all\r\nthe fields of inquiry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the most striking modern discoveries are in the field which\r\nwas opened to us by the lens in its manifold applications, it is in\r\nthe chemist's laboratory that we find that branch of science, long\r\ncultivated, but rapidly advanced only within the last two centuries,\r\nwhich has done the most for the needs of man. The ancients guessed\r\nthat the substances which make up the visible world were more\r\ncomplicated in their organization than they appear to our vision. They\r\neven suggested the great truth that matter of all kinds is made up of\r\ninconceivably small indivisible bits which they and we term atoms. It\r\nis likely that in the classic days of Greece men began to make simple\r\nexperiments of a chemical nature. A century or two after the time of\r\nMohammed, the Arabians of his faith, a people who had acquired Greek\r\nscience from the libraries which their conquests gave them, conducted\r\nextensive experiments, and named a good many familiar chemical\r\nproducts, such as alcohol, which still bears its Arabic name.\r\n\r\nThese chemical studies were continued in Europe by the alchemists, a\r\nname also of Arabic origin, a set of inquirers who were to a great\r\nextent drawn away from scientific studies by vain though unending\r\nefforts to change the baser metals into gold and silver, as well as to\r\nfind a compound which would make men immortal in the body. By the\r\ninvention of the accurate balance, and by patient weighing of the\r\nmatters which they submitted to experiment, by the invention of\r\nhypotheses or guesses at truth, which were carefully tested by\r\nexperiment, the majestic science of modern chemistry has come forth\r\nfrom the confused and mystical studies of the alchemists. We have\r\nlearned to know that there are seventy or more primitive or apparently\r\nunchangeable elements which make up the mass of this world, and\r\nprobably constitute all the celestial spheres, and that these elements\r\nin the form of their separate atoms may group themselves in almost\r\ninconceivably varied combinations. In the inanimate realm these\r\nassociations, composed of the atoms of the different substances,\r\nforming what are termed molecules, are generally composed of but few\r\nunits. Thus carbonic-acid gas, as it is commonly called, is made up of\r\nan aggregation of molecules, each composed of one atom of carbon and\r\ntwo of oxygen; water, of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen;\r\nordinary iron oxide, of two atoms of iron and three of oxygen. In the\r\nrealm of organic life, however, these combinations become vastly more\r\ncomplicated, and with each of them the properties of the substance\r\nthus produced differ from all others. A distinguished chemist has\r\nestimated that in one group of chemical compounds, that of carbon, it\r\nwould be possible to make such an array of substances that it would\r\nrequire a library of many thousand ordinary volumes to contain their\r\nnames alone.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of chemical science that it takes account of\r\nactions which are almost entirely invisible. No contrivances have been\r\nor are likely to be invented which will show the observer what takes\r\nplace when the atoms of any substance depart from their previous\r\ncombination and enter on new arrangements. We only know that under\r\ncertain conditions the old atomic associations break up, and new ones\r\nare formed. But though the processes are hidden, the results are\r\nmanifest in the changes which are brought about upon the masses of\r\nmaterial which are subjected to the altering conditions. Gradually the\r\nchemists of our day are learning to build up in their laboratories\r\nmore and more complicated compounds; already they have succeeded in\r\nproducing many of the materials which of old could only be obtained by\r\nextracting them from plants. Thus a number of the perfumes of flowers,\r\nand many of the dye-stuffs which a century ago were extracted from\r\nvegetables, and were then supposed to be only obtainable in that way,\r\nare now readily manufactured. In time it seems likely that important\r\narticles of food, for which we now depend upon the seeds of plants,\r\nmay be directly built up from the mineral kingdom. Thus the result of\r\nchemical inquiry has been not only to show us much of the vast realm\r\nof actions which go on in the earth, but to give us control of many of\r\nthese movements so that we may turn them to the needs of man.\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants were at an early day very naturally the subjects of\r\ninquiry. The ancients perceived that there were differences of kind\r\namong these creatures, and even in Aristotle's time the sciences of\r\nzoölogy and botany had attained the point where there were\r\nconsiderable treatises on those subjects. It was not, however, until a\r\nlittle more than a century ago that men began accurately to describe\r\nand classify these species of the organic world. Since the time of\r\nLinnæus the growth of our knowledge has gone forward with amazing\r\nswiftness. Within a century we have come to know perhaps a hundred\r\ntimes as much concerning these creatures as was learned in all the\r\nearlier ages. This knowledge is divisible into two main branches: in\r\none the inquirers have taken account of the different species, genera,\r\nfamilies, orders, and classes of living forms with such effect that\r\nthey have shown the existence at the present time of many hundred\r\nthousand distinct species, the vast assemblage being arranged in a\r\nclassification which shows something as to the relationship which the\r\nforms bear to each other, and furthermore that the kinds now living\r\nhave not been long in existence, but that at each stage in the history\r\nof the earth another assemblage of species peopled the waters and the\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nAt first naturalists concerned themselves only with the external forms\r\nof living creatures; but they soon came to perceive that the way in\r\nwhich these organisms worked, their physiology, in a word, afforded\r\nmatters for extended inquiry. These researches have developed the\r\nscience of physiology, or the laws of bodily action, on many accounts\r\nthe most modern and extensive of our new acquisitions of natural\r\nlearning. Through these studies we have come to know something of the\r\nlaws or principles by which life is handed on from generation to\r\ngeneration, and by which the gradations of structure have been\r\nadvanced from the simple creatures which appear like bits of animated\r\njelly to the body and mind of man.\r\n\r\nThe greatest contribution which modern naturalists have made to\r\nknowledge concerns the origin of organic species. The students of a\r\ncentury ago believed that all these different kinds had been suddenly\r\ncreated either through natural law or by the immediate will of God. We\r\nnow know that from the beginning of organic life in the remote past to\r\nthe present day one kind of animal or plant has been in a natural and\r\nessentially gradual way converted into the species which was to be its\r\nsuccessor, so that all the vast and complicated assemblage of kinds\r\nwhich now exists has been derived by a process of change from the\r\nforms which in earlier ages dwelt upon this planet. The exact manner\r\nin which these alterations were produced is not yet determined, but in\r\nlarge part it has evidently been brought about by the method indicated\r\nby Mr. Darwin, through the survival of the fittest individuals in the\r\nstruggle for existence.\r\n\r\nUntil men came to have a clear conception as to the spherical form of\r\nthe earth, it was impossible for them to begin any intelligent\r\ninquiries concerning its structure or history. The Greeks knew the\r\nearth to be a sphere, but this knowledge was lost among the early\r\nChristian people, and it was not until about four hundred years ago\r\nthat men again came to see that they dwelt upon a globe. On the basis\r\nof this understanding the science of geology, which had in a way been\r\nfounded by the Greeks, was revived. As this science depends upon the\r\nknowledge which we have gained of astronomy, physics, chemistry, and\r\nbiology, all of which branches of learning have to be used in\r\nexplaining the history of the earth, the advance which has been made\r\nhas been relatively slow. Geology as a whole is the least perfectly\r\norganized of all the divisions of learning. A special difficulty\r\npeculiar to this science has also served to hinder its development.\r\nAll the other branches of learning deal mainly, if not altogether,\r\nwith the conditions of Nature as they now exist. In this alone is it\r\nnecessary at every step to take account of actions which have been\r\nperformed in the remote past.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy matter for the students of to-day to imagine that the\r\nearth has long endured; but to our forefathers, who were educated in\r\nthe view that it had been brought from nothingness into existence\r\nabout seven thousand years ago, it was most difficult and for a time\r\nimpossible to believe in its real antiquity. Endeavouring, as they\r\nnaturally did, to account for all the wonderful revolutions, the\r\nhistory of which is written in the pages of the great stone book, the\r\nearly geologists supposed this planet to have been the seat of\r\nfrequent and violent changes, each of which revolutionized its shape\r\nand destroyed its living tenants. It was only very gradually that\r\nthey became convinced that a hundred million years or more have\r\nelapsed since the dawn of life on the earth, and that in this vast\r\nperiod the march of events has been steadfast, the changes taking\r\nplace at about the same rate in which they are now going on. As yet\r\nthis conception as to the history of our sphere has not become the\r\ngeneral property of the people, but the fact of it is recognised by\r\nall those who have attentively studied the matter. It is now as well\r\nascertained as any of the other truths which science has disclosed to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to note the historic outlines of scientific\r\ndevelopment. The most conspicuous truth which this history discloses\r\nis that all science has had its origin and almost all its development\r\namong the peoples belonging to the Aryan race. This body of folk\r\nappears to have taken on its race characteristics, acquired its\r\noriginal language, its modes of action, and the foundations of its\r\nreligion in that part of northern Europe which is about the Baltic\r\nSea. Thence the body of this people appear to have wandered toward\r\ncentral Asia, where after ages of pastoral life in the high table\r\nlands and mountains of their country it sent forth branches to India,\r\nAsia Minor and Greece, to Persia, and to western Europe. It seems ever\r\nto have been a characteristic of these Aryan peoples that they had an\r\nextreme love for Nature; moreover, they clearly perceived the need of\r\naccounting for the things that happened in the world about them. In\r\ngeneral they inclined to what is called the pantheistic explanation of\r\nthe universe. They believed a supreme God in many different forms to\r\nbe embodied in all the things they saw. Even their own minds and\r\nbodies they conceived as manifestations of this supreme power. Among\r\nthe Aryans who came to dwell in Europe and along the eastern\r\nMediterranean this method of explaining Nature was in time changed to\r\none in which humanlike gods were supposed to control the visible and\r\ninvisible worlds. In that marvellous centre of culture which was\r\ndeveloped among the Greeks this conception of humanlike deities was in\r\ntime replaced by that of natural law, and in their best days the\r\nGreeks were men of science essentially like those of to-day, except\r\nthat they had not learned by experience how important it was to\r\ncriticise their theories by patiently comparing them with the facts\r\nwhich they sought to explain. The last of the important Greek men of\r\nscience, Strabo, who was alive when Christ was born, has left us\r\nwritings which in quality are essentially like many of the able works\r\nof to-day. But for the interruption in the development of Greek\r\nlearning, natural science would probably have been fifteen hundred\r\nyears ahead of its present stage. This interruption came in two ways.\r\nIn one, through the conquest of Greece and the destruction of its\r\nintellectual life by the Romans, a people who were singularly\r\nincapable of appreciating natural science, and who had no other\r\ninterest in it except now and then a vacant and unprofitable curiosity\r\nas to the processes of the natural world. A second destructive\r\ninfluence came through the fact that Christianity, in its energetic\r\nprotest against the sins of the pagan civilization, absolutely\r\nneglected and in a way despised all forms of science.\r\n\r\nThe early indifference of Christians to natural learning is partly to\r\nbe explained by the fact that their religion was developed among the\r\nHebrews, a people remarkable for their lack of interest in the\r\nscientific aspects of Nature. To them it was a sufficient explanation\r\nthat one omnipotent God ruled all things at his will, the heavens and\r\nthe earth alike being held in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nFinding the centre of its development among the Romans, Christianity\r\ncame mainly into the control of a people who, as we have before\r\nremarked, had no scientific interest in the natural world. This\r\ncondition prolonged the separation of our faith from science for\r\nfifteen hundred years after its beginning. In this time the records of\r\nGreek scientific learning mostly disappeared. The writings of\r\nAristotle were preserved in part for the reason that the Church\r\nadopted many of his views concerning questions in moral philosophy and\r\nin politics. The rest of Greek learning was, so far as Europe was\r\nconcerned, quite neglected.\r\n\r\nA large part of Greek science which has come down to us owes its\r\npreservation to a very singular incident in the history of learning.\r\nIn the ninth century, after the Arabs had been converted to\r\nMohammedanism, and on the basis of that faith had swiftly organized a\r\ngreat and cultivated empire, the scholars of that folk became deeply\r\ninterested in the remnants of Greek learning which had survived in the\r\nmonastic and other libraries about the eastern Mediterranean. So\r\ngreatly did they prize these records, which were contemned by the\r\nChristians, that it was their frequent custom to weigh the old\r\nmanuscripts in payment against the coin of their realm. In astronomy,\r\nmathematics, chemistry, and geology the Arabian students, building on\r\nthe ancient foundations, made notable and for a time most important\r\nadvances. In the tenth century of our era they seemed fairly in the\r\nway to do for science what western Europe began five centuries later\r\nto accomplish. In the fourteenth century the centre of Mohammedan\r\nstrength was transferred from the Arabians to the Turks, from a people\r\nnaturally given to learning to a folk of another race, who despised\r\nall such culture. Thenceforth in place of the men who had treasured\r\nand deciphered with infinite pains all the records of earlier\r\nlearning, the followers of Mohammed zealously destroyed all the\r\nrecords of the olden days. Some of these records, however, survived\r\namong the Arabs of Spain, and others were preserved by the Christian\r\nscholars who dwelt in Byzantium, or Constantinople, and were brought\r\ninto western Europe when that city was captured by the Turks in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nAlready the advance of the fine arts in Italy and the general tendency\r\ntoward the study of Nature, such as painting and sculpture indicate,\r\nhad made a beginning, or rather a proper field for a beginning, of\r\nscientific inquiry. The result was a new interest in Greek learning in\r\nall its branches, and a very rapid awakening of the scientific spirit.\r\nAt first the Roman Church made no opposition to this new interest\r\nwhich developed among its followers, but in the course of a few years,\r\nanimated with the fear that science would lead men to doubt many of\r\nthe dogmas of the Church, it undertook sternly to repress the work of\r\nall inquirers.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between those of the Roman faith and the men of science\r\ncontinued for above two hundred years. In general, the part which the\r\nChurch took was one of remonstrance, but in a few cases the spirit of\r\nfanaticism led to the persecution of the men who did not obey its\r\nmandates and disavow all belief in the new opinions which were deemed\r\ncontrary to the teachings of Scripture. The last instance of such\r\noppression occurred in France in the year 1756, when the great Buffon\r\nwas required to recant certain opinions concerning the antiquity of\r\nthe earth which he had published in his work on Natural History. This\r\nhe promptly did, and in almost servile language withdrew all the\r\nopinions to which the fathers had objected. A like conflict between\r\nthe followers of science and the clerical authorities occurred in\r\nProtestant countries. Although in no case were the men of science\r\nphysically tortured or executed for their opinions, they were\r\nnevertheless subjected to great religious and social pressure: they\r\nwere almost as effectively disciplined as were those who fell under\r\nthe ban of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nSome historians have criticised the action of the clerical authorities\r\ntoward science as if the evil which was done had been performed in our\r\nown day. It should be remembered, however, that in the earlier\r\ncenturies the churches regarded themselves as bound to protect all men\r\nfrom the dangers of heresy. For centuries in the early history of\r\nChristianity the defenders of the faith had been engaged in a\r\nlife-and-death struggle with paganism, the followers of which held all\r\nthat was known of Nature. Quite naturally the priestly class feared\r\nthat the revival of scientific inquiry would bring with it the evils\r\nfrom which the world had suffered in pagan times. There is no doubt\r\nthat these persecutions of science were done under what seemed the\r\nobligations of duty. They may properly be explained particularly by\r\nmen of science as one of the symptoms of development in the day in\r\nwhich they were done. It is well for those who harshly criticise the\r\nrelations of the Church to science to remember that in our own\r\ncountry, about two centuries ago, among the most enlightened and\r\nreligious people of the time, Quakers were grievously persecuted, and\r\nwitches hanged, all in the most dutiful and God-fearing way. In\r\nconsidering these relations of science to our faith, the matter should\r\nbe dealt with in a philosophical way, and with a sense of the\r\ndifferences between our own and earlier ages.\r\n\r\nTo the student of the relations between Christianity and science it\r\nmust appear doubtful whether the criticism or the other consequences\r\nwhich the men of science had to meet from the Church was harmful to\r\ntheir work. The early naturalists, like the Greeks whom they followed,\r\nwere greatly given to speculations concerning the processes of Nature,\r\nwhich, though interesting, were unprofitable. They also showed a\r\ncurious tendency to mingle their scientific speculations with ancient\r\nand base superstitions. They were often given to the absurdity\r\ncommonly known as the \"black art,\" or witchcraft, and held to the\r\npreposterous notions of the astrologists. Even the immortal astronomer\r\nKepler, who lived in the sixteenth century, was a professional\r\nastrologer, and still held to the notion that the stars determined the\r\ndestiny of men. Many other of the famous inquirers in those years\r\nwhich ushered in modern science believed in witchcraft. Thus for a\r\ntime natural learning was in a way associated with ancient and\r\npernicious beliefs which the Church was seeking to overthrow. One\r\nresult of the clerical opposition to the advancement of science was\r\nthat its votaries were driven to prove every step which led to their\r\nconclusions. They were forced to abandon the loose speculation of\r\ntheir intellectual guides, the Greeks, and to betake themselves to\r\nobservation. Thus a part of the laborious fact-gathering habit on\r\nwhich the modern advance of science has absolutely depended was due to\r\nthe care which men had to exercise in face of the religious\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIn our own time, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the\r\nconflict between the religious authority and the men of science has\r\npractically ceased. Even the Roman Church permits almost everywhere an\r\nuntrammelled teaching of the established learning to which it was at\r\none time opposed. Men have come to see that all truth is accordant,\r\nand that religion has nothing to fear from the faithful and devoted\r\nstudy of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe advance of science in general in modern times has been greatly due\r\nto the development of mechanical inventions. Among the ancients, the\r\ntools which served in the arts were few in number, and these of\r\nexceeding simplicity. So far as we can ascertain, in the five hundred\r\nyears during which the Greeks were in their intellectual vigour, not\r\nmore than half a dozen new machines were invented, and these were\r\nexceedingly simple. The fact seems to be that a talent for mechanical\r\ninvention is mainly limited to the peoples of France, Germany, and of\r\nthe English-speaking folk. The first advances in these contrivances\r\nwere made in those countries, and all our considerable gains have come\r\nfrom their people. Thus, while the spirit of science in general is\r\nclearly limited to the Aryan folk, that particular part of the motive\r\nwhich leads to the invention of tools is restricted to western and\r\nnorthern Europe, to the people to whom we give the name of Teutonic.\r\n\r\nMechanical inventions have aided the development of our sciences in\r\nseveral ways. They have furnished inquirers with instruments of\r\nprecision; they have helped to develop accuracy of observation; best\r\nof all, they have served ever to bring before the attention of men a\r\nspectacle of the conditions in Nature which we term cause and effect.\r\nThe influence of these inventions on the development of learning has\r\nbeen particularly great where the machines, such as our wind and water\r\nmills, and our steam engine, make use of the forces of Nature,\r\nsubjugating them to the needs of man. Such instruments give an\r\nunending illustration as to the presence in Nature of energy. They\r\nhave helped men to understand that the machinery of the universe is\r\npropelled by the unending application of power. It was, in fact,\r\nthrough such machines that men of science first came to understand\r\nthat energy, manifested in the natural forces, is something that\r\neternally endures; that we may change its form in our arts as its form\r\nis changed in the operations of Nature, but the power endures forever.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the first observation which led to this\r\nmost important scientific conclusion that energy is indestructible\r\nhowever much it may change its form, was made by an American, Benjamin\r\nThompson, who left this country at the time of the Revolution, and\r\nafter a curious life became the executive officer, and in effect king,\r\nof Bavaria. While engaged in superintending the manufacture of cannon,\r\nhe observed that in boring out the barrel of the gun an amount of heat\r\nwas produced which evaporated a certain amount of water. He therefore\r\nconcluded that the energy required to do the boring of the metal\r\npassed into the state of heat, and thus only changed its state, in no\r\nwise disappearing from the earth. Other students pursuing the same\r\nline of inquiry have clearly demonstrated what is called the law of\r\nthe conservation of energy, which more than anything has helped us to\r\nunderstand the large operations of Nature. Through these studies we\r\nhave come to see that, while the universe is a place of ceaseless\r\nchange, the quantities of energy and of matter remain unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing brief sketch, which sets forth some of the important\r\nconditions which have affected the development of science, may in a\r\nway serve to show the student how he can himself become an interpreter\r\nof Nature. The evidence indicates that the people of our race have\r\nbeen in a way chosen among all the varieties of mankind to lead in\r\nthis great task of comprehending the visible universe. The facts,\r\nmoreover, show that discovery usually begins with the interest which\r\nmen feel in the world immediately about them, or which is presented to\r\ntheir senses in a daily spectacle. Thus Benjamin Franklin, in the\r\nmidst of a busy life, became deeply interested in the phenomena of\r\nlightning, and by a very simple experiment proved that this wonder of\r\nthe air was due to electrical action such as we may arouse by rubbing\r\na stick of sealing-wax or a piece of amber with a cloth. All\r\ndiscoveries, in a word, have had their necessary beginnings in an\r\ninterest in the facts which daily experience discloses. This desire to\r\nknow something more than the first sight exhibits concerning the\r\nactions in the world about us is native in every human soul--at least,\r\nin all those who are born with the heritage of our race. It is\r\ncommonly strong in childhood; if cultivated by use, it will grow\r\nthroughout a lifetime, and, like other faculties, becomes the stronger\r\nand more effective by the exertions which it inspires. It is therefore\r\nmost important that every one should obey this instinctive command to\r\ninquiry, and organize his life and work so that he may not lose but\r\ngain more and more as time goes on of this noble capacity to\r\ninterrogate and understand the world about him.\r\n\r\nIt is best that all study of Nature should begin not in laboratories,\r\nnor with the things which are remote from us, but in the field of\r\nNature which is immediately about us. The student, even if he dwell in\r\nthe unfavourable conditions of a great city, is surrounded by the\r\nworld which has yielded immeasurable riches in the way of learning,\r\nwhich he can appropriate by a little study. He can readily come to\r\nknow something of the movements of the air; the buildings will give\r\nhim access to a great many different kinds of stone; the smallest\r\npark, a little garden, or even a few potted plants and captive\r\nanimals, may tell him much concerning the forms and actions of living\r\nbeings. By studying in this way he can come to know something of the\r\ndifferences between things and their relations to each other. He will\r\nthus have a standard by which he can measure and make familiar the\r\nbody of learning concerning Nature which he may find in books. From\r\nprinted pages alone, however well they be written, he can never hope\r\nto catch the spirit that animates the real inquirer, the true lover of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nOn many accounts the most attractive way of beginning to form the\r\nhabit of the naturalist is by the study of living animals and plants.\r\nTo all of us life adds interest, and growth has a charm. Therefore it\r\nis well for the student to start on the way of inquiry by watching the\r\nactions of birds and insects or by rearing plants. It is fortunate if\r\nhe can do both these agreeable things. When the habit of taking an\r\naccount of that most important part of the world which is immediately\r\nabout him has been developed in the student, he may profitably proceed\r\nto acquire the knowledge of the invisible universe which has been\r\ngathered by the host of inquirers of his race. However far he\r\njourneys, he should return to the home world that lies immediately and\r\nfamiliarly about him, for there alone can he acquire and preserve that\r\npersonal acquaintance with things which is at once the inspiration and\r\nthe test of all knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlong with this study of the familiar objects about us the student may\r\nwell combine some reading which may serve to show him how others have\r\nbeen successful in thus dealing with Nature at first hand. For this\r\npurpose there are, unfortunately, but few works which are well\r\ncalculated to serve the needs of the beginner. Perhaps the best\r\nnaturalist book, though its form is somewhat ancient, is White's\r\nNatural History of Selborne. Hugh Miller's works, particularly his Old\r\nRed Sandstone and My Schools and Schoolmasters, show well how a man\r\nmay become a naturalist under difficulties. Sir John Lubbock's studies\r\non Wasps, and Darwin's work on Animals and Plants under Domestication\r\nare also admirable to show how observation should be made. Dr. Asa\r\nGray's little treatise on How Plants Grow will also be useful to the\r\nbeginner who wishes to approach botany from its most attractive\r\nside--that of the development of the creature from the seed to seed.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of training which every beginner in the art of\r\nobserving Nature should obtain, and which many naturalists of repute\r\nwould do well to give themselves--namely, an education in what we may\r\ncall the art of distance and geographical forms. With the primitive\r\nsavage the capacity to remember and to picture to the eye the shape of\r\na country which he knows is native and instinctive. Accustomed to\r\nrange the woods, and to trust to his recollection to guide him through\r\nthe wilderness to his home, the primitive man develops an important\r\nart which among civilized people is generally dormant. In fact, in our\r\nwell-trodden ways people may go for many generations without ever\r\nbeing called upon to use this natural sense of geography. The easiest\r\nway to cultivate the geographic sense is by practising the art of\r\nmaking sketch maps. This the student, however untrained, can readily\r\ndo by taking first his own dwelling house, on which he should practise\r\nuntil he can readily from memory make a tolerably correct and\r\nproportional plan of all its rooms. Then on a smaller scale he should\r\nbegin to make also from recollection a map showing the distribution of\r\nthe roads, streams, and hills with which his daily life makes him\r\nfamiliar. From time to time this work from memory should be compared\r\nwith the facts. At first the record will be found to be very poor, but\r\nwith a few months of occasional endeavour the observer will find that\r\nhis mind takes account of geographic features in a way it did not\r\nbefore, and, moreover, that his mind becomes enriched with\r\nimpressions of the country which are clear and distinct, in place of\r\nthe shadowy recollections which he at first possessed.\r\n\r\nWhen the student has attained the point where, after walking or riding\r\nover a country, he can readily recall its physical features of the\r\nsimpler sort, he will find it profitable to undertake the method of\r\nmapping with contour lines--that is, by pencilling in indications to\r\nshow the exact shape of the elevations and depressions. The principle\r\nof contour lines is that each of them represents where water would\r\ncome against the slope if the area were sunk step by step below the\r\nsea level--in other words, each contour line marks the intersection of\r\na horizontal plane with the elevation of the country. Practice on this\r\nsomewhat difficult task will soon give the student some idea as to the\r\ncomplication of the surface of a region, and afford him the basis for\r\na better understanding of what geography means than all the reading he\r\ncan do will effect. It is most desirable that training such as has\r\nbeen described should be a part of our ordinary school education.\r\n\r\nVery few people have clear ideas of distances. Even the men whose\r\ntrade requires some such knowledge are often without that which a\r\nlittle training could give them. Without some capacity in this\r\ndirection, the student is always at a disadvantage in his contact with\r\nNature. He can not make a record of what he sees as long as the\r\nelement of horizontal and vertical distance is not clearly in mind. To\r\nattain this end the student should begin by pacing some length of road\r\nwhere the distances are well known. In this way he will learn the\r\nlength of his step, which with a grown man generally ranges between\r\ntwo and a half and three feet. Learning the average length of his\r\nstride by frequent counting, it is easy to repeat the trial until one\r\ncan almost unconsciously keep the count as he walks. Properly to\r\nsecure the training of this sort the observer should first attentively\r\nlook across the distance which is to be determined. He should notice\r\nhow houses, fences, people, and trees appear at that distance. He will\r\nquickly perceive that each hundred feet of additional interval\r\nsomewhat changes their aspect. In training soldiers to measure with\r\nthe eye the distances which they have to know in order effectively to\r\nuse the modern weapons of war, a common device is to take a squad of\r\nmen, or sometimes a company, under the command of an officer, who\r\nhalts one man at each hundred yards until the detachment is strung out\r\nwith that interval as far as the eye can see them. The men then walk\r\nto and fro so that the troops who are watching them may note the\r\neffects of increased distance on their appearance, whether standing or\r\nin motion. At three thousand yards a man appears as a mere dot, which\r\nis not readily distinguishable. Schoolboys may find this experiment\r\namusing and instructive.\r\n\r\nAfter the student has gained, as he readily may, some sense of the\r\ndivisions of distance within the range of ordinary vision, he should\r\ntry to form some notion of greater intervals, as of ten, a hundred,\r\nand perhaps a thousand miles. The task becomes more difficult as the\r\nlength of the line increases, but most persons can with a little\r\naddress manage to bring before their eyes a tolerably clear image of a\r\nhundred miles of distance by looking from some elevation which\r\ncommands a great landscape. It is doubtful, however, whether the\r\nbest-trained man can get any clear notion of a thousand miles--that\r\nis, can present it to himself in imagination as he may readily do with\r\nshorter intervals.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of the general education which the student has\r\nto give himself is begun when he undertakes to picture long intervals\r\nof time. Space we have opportunities to measure, and we come in a way\r\nto appreciate it, but the longest lived of men experiences at most a\r\ncentury of life, and this is too small a measure to give any notion as\r\nto the duration of such great events as are involved in the history of\r\nthe earth, where the periods are to be reckoned by the millions of\r\nyears. The only way in which we can get any aid in picturing to\r\nourselves great lapses of time is by expressing them in units of\r\ndistance. Let a student walk away on a straight road for the distance\r\nof a mile; let him call each step a year; when he has won the first\r\nmilestone, he may consider that he has gone backward in time to the\r\nperiod of Christ's birth. Two miles more will take him to the station\r\nwhich will represent the age when the oldest pyramids were built. He\r\nis still, however, in the later days of man's history on this planet.\r\nTo attain on the scale the time when man began, he might well have to\r\nwalk fifty miles away, while a journey which would thus by successive\r\nsteps describe the years of the earth's history since life appeared\r\nupon its surface would probably require him to circle the earth at\r\nleast four times. We may accept it as impossible for any one to deal\r\nwith such vast durations save with figures which are never really\r\ncomprehended. It is well, however, to enlarge our view as to the age\r\nof the earth by such efforts as have just been indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen we go beyond the earth into the realm of the stars all efforts\r\ntoward understanding the ranges of space or the durations of time are\r\nquite beyond the efforts of man. Even the distance of about two\r\nhundred and forty thousand miles which separates us from the moon can\r\nnot be grasped by even the greater minds. No human intelligence,\r\nhowever cultivated, can conceive the distance of about ninety-five\r\nmillion miles which separates us from the sun. In the celestial realm\r\nwe can only deal with relations of space and time in a general and\r\ncomparative way. We can state the distances if we please in millions\r\nof miles, or we can reckon the ampler spaces by using the interval\r\nwhich separates the earth from the sun as we do a foot rule in our\r\nordinary work, but the depths of the starry spaces can only be sounded\r\nby the winged imagination.\r\n\r\nAlthough the student has been advised to begin his studies of Nature\r\non the field whereon he dwells, making that study the basis of his\r\nmost valuable communications with Nature, it is desirable that he\r\nshould at the same time gain some idea as to the range and scope of\r\nour knowledge concerning the visible universe. As an aid toward this\r\nend the following chapters of this book will give a very brief survey\r\nof some of the most important truths concerning the heavens and the\r\nearth which have rewarded the studies of scientific men. Of remoter\r\nthings, such as the bodies in the stellar spaces, the account will be\r\nbrief, for that which is known and important to the general student\r\ncan be briefly told. So, too, of the earlier ages of the earth's\r\nhistory, although a vast deal is known, the greater part of the\r\nknowledge is of interest and value mainly to geologists who cultivate\r\nthat field. That which is most striking and most important to the mass\r\nof mankind is to be found in the existing state of our earth, the\r\nconditions which make it a fit abode for our kind, and replete with\r\nlessons which he may study with his own eyes without having to travel\r\nthe difficult paths of the higher sciences.\r\n\r\nAlthough physiography necessarily takes some account of the things\r\nwhich have been, even in the remote past, and this for the reason that\r\neverything in this day of the world depends on the events of earlier\r\ndays, the accent of its teaching is on the immediate, visible, as we\r\nmay say, living world, which is a part of the life of all its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                         THE STELLAR REALM.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before men came to take any careful account of the Nature\r\nimmediately about them they began to conjecture and in a way to\r\ninquire concerning the stars and the other heavenly bodies. It is\r\ndifficult for us to imagine how hard it was for students to gain any\r\nadequate idea of what those lights in the sky really are. At first men\r\nimagined the celestial bodies to be, as they seemed, small objects not\r\nvery far away. Among the Greeks the view grew up that the heavens were\r\nformed of crystal spheres in which the lights were placed, much as\r\nlanterns may be hung upon a ceiling. These spheres were conceived to\r\nbe one above the other; the planets were on the lower of them, and the\r\nfixed stars on the higher, the several crystal roofs revolving about\r\nthe earth. So long as the earth was supposed to be a flat and\r\nlimitless expanse, forming the centre of the universe, it was\r\nimpossible for the students of the heavens to attain any more rational\r\nview as to their plan.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the earth was globular in form was understood by the\r\nGreek men of science. They may, indeed, have derived the opinion from\r\nthe Egyptian philosophers. The discovery rested upon the readily\r\nobserved fact that on a given day the shadow of objects of a certain\r\nheight was longer in high latitude than in low. Within the tropics,\r\nwhen the sun was vertical, there would be no shadow, while as far\r\nnorth as Athens it would be of considerable length. The conclusion\r\nthat the earth was a sphere appears to have been the first large\r\ndiscovery made by our race. It was, indeed, one of the most important\r\nintellectual acquisitions of man.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the globular form of the earth, the next and most\r\nnatural step was to learn that the earth was not the centre of the\r\nplanetary system, much less of the universe, but that that centre was\r\nthe sun, around which the earth and the other planets revolved. The\r\nGreeks appear to have had some idea that this was the case, and their\r\nspirit of inquiry would probably have led them to the whole truth but\r\nfor the overthrow of their thought by the Roman conquest and the\r\nspread of Christianity. It was therefore not until after the revival\r\nof learning that astronomers won their way to our modern understanding\r\nconcerning the relation of the planets to the sun. With Galileo this\r\nopinion was affirmed. Although for a time the Church, resting its\r\nopposition on the interpretation of certain passages of Scripture,\r\nresisted this view, and even punished the men who held it, it\r\nsteadfastly made its way, and for more than two centuries has been the\r\nfoundation of all the great discoveries in the stellar realm. Yet long\r\nafter the fact that the sun was the centre of the solar system was\r\nwell established no one understood why the planets should move in\r\ntheir ceaseless, orderly procession around the central mass. To Newton\r\nwe owe the studies on the law of gravitation which brought us to our\r\npresent large conception as to the origin of this order. Starting with\r\nthe view that bodies attracted each other in proportion to their\r\nweight, and in diminishing proportion as they are removed from each\r\nother, Newton proceeded by most laborious studies to criticise this\r\nview, and in the end definitely proved it by finding that the motions\r\nof the moon about the earth, as well as the paths of the planets,\r\nexactly agreed with the supposition.\r\n\r\nThe last great path-breaking discovery which has helped us in our\r\nunderstanding of the stars was made by Fraunhofer and other\r\nphysicists, who showed us that substances when in a heated, gaseous,\r\nor vaporous state produced, in a way which it is not easy to explain\r\nin a work such as this, certain dark lines in the spectrum, or streak\r\nof divided light which we may make by means of a glass prism, or, as\r\nin the rainbow, by drops of water. Carefully studying these very\r\nnumerous lines, those naturalists found that they could with singular\r\naccuracy determine what substances there were in the flame which gave\r\nthe light. So accurate is this determination that it has been made to\r\nserve in certain arts where there is no better means of ascertaining\r\nthe conditions of a flaming substance except by the lines which its\r\nlight exhibits under this kind of analysis. Thus, in the manufacture\r\nof iron by what is called the Bessemer process, it has been found very\r\nconvenient to judge as to the state of the molten metal by such an\r\nanalysis of the flame which comes forth from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seal Rocks near San Francisco, California, showing\r\nslight effect of waves where there is no beach._]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the spectroscope invented than astronomers hastened by\r\nits aid to explore the chemical constitution of the sun. These studies\r\nhave made it plain that the light of our solar centre comes forth from\r\nan atmosphere composed of highly heated substances, all of which are\r\nknown among the materials forming the earth. Although for various\r\nreasons we have not been able to recognise in the sun all the elements\r\nwhich are found in our sphere, it is certain that in general the two\r\nbodies are alike in composition. An extension of the same method of\r\ninquiry to the fixed stars was gradually though with difficulty\r\nattained, and we now know that many of the elements common to the sun\r\nand earth exist in those distant spheres. Still further, this method\r\nof inquiry has shown us, in a way which it is not worth while here to\r\ndescribe, that among these remoter suns there are many aggregations of\r\nmatter which are not consolidated as are the spheres of our own solar\r\nsystem, but remain in the gaseous state, receiving the name of nebulæ.\r\n\r\nAlong with the growth of observational astronomy which has taken place\r\nsince the discoveries of Galileo, there has been developed a view\r\nconcerning the physical history of the stellar world, known as the\r\nnebular hypothesis, which, though not yet fully proved, is believed by\r\nmost astronomers and physicists to give us a tolerably correct notion\r\nas to the way in which the heavenly spheres were formed from an\r\nearlier condition of matter. This majestic conception was first\r\nadvanced, in modern times at least, by the German philosopher Immanuel\r\nKant. It was developed by the French astronomer Laplace, and is often\r\nknown by his name. The essence of this view rests upon the fact\r\npreviously noted that in the realm of the fixed stars there are many\r\nfaintly shining aggregations of matter which are evidently not solid\r\nafter the manner of the bodies in our solar system, but are in the\r\nstate where their substances are in the condition of dustlike\r\nparticles, as are the bits of carbon in flame or the elements which\r\ncompose the atmosphere. The view held by Laplace was to the effect\r\nthat not only our own solar system, but the centres of all the other\r\nsimilar systems, the fixed stars, were originally in this gaseous\r\nstate, the material being disseminated throughout all parts of the\r\nheavenly realm, or at least in that portion of the universe of which\r\nwe are permitted to know something. In this ancient state of matter we\r\nhave to suppose that the particles of it were more separated from each\r\nother than are the atoms of the atmospheric gases in the most perfect\r\nvacuum which we can produce with the air-pump. Still we have to\r\nsuppose that each of these particles attract the other in the\r\ngravitative way, as in the present state of the universe they\r\ninevitably do.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the gravitative attraction the materials of\r\nthis realm of vapour inevitably tended to fall in toward the centre.\r\nIf the process had been perfectly simple, the result would have been\r\nthe formation of one vast mass, including all the matter which was in\r\nthe original body. In some way, no one has yet been able to make a\r\nreasonable suggestion of just how, there were developed in the\r\nprocess of concentration a great many separate centres of aggregation,\r\neach of which became the beginning of a solar system. The student may\r\nform some idea of how readily local centres may be produced in\r\nmaterials disseminated in the vaporous state by watching how fog or\r\nthe thin, even misty clouds of the sunrise often gather into the\r\nseparate shapes which make what we term a \"mackerel\" sky. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine what makes centres of attraction, but we readily\r\nperceive by this instance how they might have occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen the materials of each solar system were thus set apart from the\r\noriginal mass of star dust or vapour, they began an independent\r\ndevelopment which led step by step, in the case of our own solar\r\nsystem at least, and presumably also in the case of the other suns,\r\nthe fixed stars, to the formation of planets and their moons or\r\nsatellites, all moving around the central sun. At this stage of the\r\nexplanation the nebular hypothesis is more difficult to conceive than\r\nin the parts of it which have already been described, for we have now\r\nto understand how the planets and satellites had their matter\r\nseparated from each other and from the solar centre, and why they came\r\nto revolve around that central body. These problems are best\r\nunderstood by noting some familiar instances connected with the\r\nmovement of fluids and gases toward a centre. First let us take the\r\ncase of a basin in which the water is allowed to flow out through a\r\nhole in its centre. When we lift the stopper the fluid for a moment\r\nfalls straight down through the opening. Very quickly, however, all\r\nthe particles of the water start to move toward the centre, and almost\r\nat once the mass begins to whirl round with such speed that, although\r\nit is working toward the middle, it is by its movement pushed away\r\nfrom the centre and forms a conical depression. As often as we try the\r\nexperiment, the effect is always the same. We thus see that there is\r\nsome principle which makes particles of fluid that tend toward a\r\ncentre fail directly to attain it, but win their way thereto in a\r\ndevious, spinning movement.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact is not so readily made visible to the eye, the same\r\nprinciple is illustrated in whirling storms, in which, as we shall\r\nhereafter note with more detail, the air next the surface of the earth\r\nis moving in toward a kind of chimney by which it escapes to the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere. A study of cyclones and tornadoes, or even\r\nof the little air-whirls which in hot weather lift the dust of our\r\nstreets, shows that the particles of the atmosphere in rushing in\r\ntoward the centre of upward movement take on the same whirling motion\r\nas do the molecules of water in the basin--in fact, the two actions\r\nare perfectly comparable in all essential regards, except that the\r\nfluid is moving downward, while the air flows upward. Briefly stated,\r\nthe reason for the movement of fluid and gas in the whirling way is as\r\nfollows: If every particle on its way to the centre moved on a\r\nperfectly straight line toward the point of escape, the flow would be\r\ndirectly converging, and the paths followed would resemble the spokes\r\nof a wheel. But when by chance one of the particles sways ever so\r\nlittle to one side of the direct way, a slight lateral motion would\r\nnecessarily be established. This movement would be due to the fact\r\nthat the particle which pursued the curved line would press against\r\nthe particles on the out-curved side of its path--or, in other words,\r\nshove them a little in that direction--to the extent that they\r\ndeparted from the direct line they would in turn communicate the\r\nshoving to the next beyond. When two particles are thus shoving on one\r\nside of their paths, the action which makes for revolution is doubled,\r\nand, as we readily see, the whole mass may in this way become quickly\r\naffected, the particles driven out of their path, moving in a curve\r\ntoward the centre. We also see that the action is accumulative: the\r\nmore curved the path of each particle, the more effectively it shoves;\r\nand so, in the case of the basin, we see the whirling rapidly\r\ndeveloped before our eyes.\r\n\r\nIn falling in toward the centre the particles of star dust or vapour\r\nwould no more have been able one and all to pursue a perfectly\r\nstraight line than the particles of water in the basin. If a man\r\nshould spend his lifetime in filling and emptying such a vessel, it is\r\nsafe to say that he would never fail to observe the whirling movement.\r\nAs the particles of matter in the nebular mass which was to become a\r\nsolar system are inconceivably greater than those of water in the\r\nbasin, or those of air in the atmospheric whirl, the chance of the\r\nwhirling taking place in the heavenly bodies is so great that we may\r\nassume that it would inevitably occur.\r\n\r\nAs the vapours in the olden day tended in toward the centre of our\r\nsolar system, and the mass revolved, there is reason to believe that\r\nringlike separations took place in it. Whirling in the manner\r\nindicated, the mass of vapour or dust would flatten into a disk or a\r\nbody of circular shape, with much the greater diameter in the plane of\r\nits whirling. As the process of concentration went on, this disk is\r\nsupposed to have divided into ringlike masses, some approach to which\r\nwe can discern in the existing nebulæ, which here and there among the\r\nfarther fixed stars appear to be undergoing such stages of development\r\ntoward solar systems. It is reasonably supposed that after these rings\r\nhad been developed they would break to pieces, the matter in them\r\ngathering into a sphere, which in time was to become a planet. The\r\noutermost of these rings led to the formation of the planet farthest\r\nfrom the sun, and was probably the first to separate from the parent\r\nmass. Then in succession rings were formed inwardly, each leading in\r\nturn to the creation of another planet, the sun itself being the\r\nremnant, by far the greater part of the whole mass of matter, which\r\ndid not separate in the manner described, but concentrated on its\r\ncentre. Each of these planetary aggregations of vapour tended to\r\ndevelop, as it whirled upon its centre, rings of its own, which in\r\nturn formed, by breaking and concentrating, the satellites or moons\r\nwhich attend the earth, as they do all the planets which lie farther\r\naway from the sun than our sphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Saturn, Jan. 26, 1889 (Antoniadi).]\r\n\r\nAs if to prove that the planets and moons of the solar system were\r\nformed somewhat in the manner in which we have described it, one of\r\nthese spheres, Saturn, retains a ring, or rather a band which appears\r\nto be divided obscurely into several rings which lie between its group\r\nof satellites and the main sphere. How this ring has been preserved\r\nwhen all the others have disappeared, and what is the exact\r\nconstitution of the mass, is not yet well ascertained. It seems clear,\r\nhowever, that it can not be composed of solid matter. It is either in\r\nthe form of dust or of small spheres, which are free to move on each\r\nother; otherwise, as computation shows, the strains due to the\r\nattraction which Saturn itself and its moons exercise upon it would\r\nserve to break it in pieces. Although this ring theory of the\r\nformation of the planets and satellites is not completely proved, the\r\noccurrence of such a structure as that which girdles Saturn affords\r\npresumptive evidence that it is true. Taken in connection with what we\r\nknow of the nebulæ, the proof of Laplace's nebular hypothesis may\r\nfairly be regarded as complete.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that some of the fixed stars are not isolated suns\r\nlike our own, but are composed of two great spheres revolving about\r\none another; hence they are termed double stars. The motions of these\r\nbodies are very peculiar, and their conditions show us that it is not\r\nwell to suppose that the solar system in which we dwell is the only\r\ntype of order which prevails in the celestial families; there may,\r\nindeed, be other variations as yet undetected. Still, these\r\ndifferences throw no doubt on the essential truth of the theory as to\r\nthe process of development of the celestial systems. Though there is\r\nmuch room for debate as to the details of the work there, the general\r\ntruth of the theory is accepted by nearly all the students of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nA peculiar advantage of the nebular hypothesis is that it serves to\r\naccount for the energy which appears as light and heat in the sun and\r\nthe fixed stars, as well as that which still abides in the mass of our\r\nearth, and doubtless also in the other large planets. When the matter\r\nof which these spheres were composed was disseminated through the\r\nrealms of space, it is supposed to have had no positive temperature,\r\nand to have been dark, realizing the conception which appears in the\r\nfirst chapter of Genesis, \"without form, and void.\" With each stage of\r\nthe falling in toward the solar centres what is called the \"energy of\r\nposition\" of this original matter became converted into light and\r\nheat. To understand how this took place, the reader should consider\r\ncertain simple yet noble generalizations of physics. We readily\r\nrecognise the fact that when a hammer falls often on an anvil it heats\r\nitself and the metal on which it strikes. Those who have been able to\r\nobserve the descent of meteoric stones from the heavens have remarked\r\nthat when they came to the earth they were, on their surfaces at\r\nleast, exceedingly hot. Any one may observe shining meteors now and\r\nthen flashing in the sky. These are known commonly to be very small\r\nbits of matter, probably not larger than grains of sand, which,\r\nrushing into our atmosphere, are so heated by the friction which they\r\nencounter that they burn to a gas or vapour before they attain the\r\nearth. As we know that these particles come from the starry spaces,\r\nwhere the temperature is somewhere near 500° below 0° Fahr., it is\r\nevident that the light and heat are not brought with them into the\r\natmosphere; it can only be explained by the fact that when they enter\r\nthe air they are moving at an average speed of about twenty miles a\r\nsecond, and that the energy which this motion represents is by the\r\nresistance which the body encounters converted into heat. This fact\r\nwill help us to understand how, as the original star dust fell in\r\ntoward the centre of attraction, it was able to convert what we have\r\ntermed the energy of position into temperature. We see clearly that\r\nevery such particle of dust or larger bit of matter which falls upon\r\nthe earth brings about the development of heat, even though it does\r\nnot actually strike upon the solid mass of our sphere. The conception\r\nof what took place in the consolidation of the originally disseminated\r\nmaterials of the sun and planets can be somewhat helped by a simple\r\nexperiment. If we fit a piston closely into a cylinder, and then\r\nsuddenly drive it down with a heavy blow, the compressed air is so\r\nheated that it may be made to communicate fire. If the piston should\r\nbe slowly moved, the same amount of heat would be generated, or, as we\r\nmay better say, liberated by the compression, though the effect would\r\nnot be so striking. A host of experiments show that when a given mass\r\nof matter is brought to occupy a less space the effect is in\r\npractically all cases to increase the temperature. The energy which\r\nkept the particles apart is, when they are driven together, converted\r\ninto heat. These two classes of actions are somewhat different in\r\ntheir nature; in the case of the meteors, or the equivalent star dust,\r\nthe coming together of the particles is due to gravitation. In the\r\nexperiment with the cylinder above described, the compression is due\r\nto mechanical energy, a force of another nature.\r\n\r\nThere is reason for believing that all our planets, as well as the sun\r\nitself, and also the myriad other orbs of space, have all passed\r\nthrough the stages of a transition in which a continually\r\nconcentrating vapour, drawn together by gravitation, became\r\nprogressively hotter and more dense until it assumed the condition of\r\na fluid. This fluid gradually parted with its heat to the cold spaces\r\nof the heavens, and became more and more concentrated and of a lower\r\ntemperature until in the end, as in the case of our earth and of other\r\nplanets, it ceased to glow on the outside, though it remained\r\nintensely heated in the inner parts. It is easy to see that the rate\r\nof this cooling would be in some proportion to the size of the sphere.\r\nThus the earth, which is relatively small, has become relatively cold,\r\nwhile the sun itself, because of its vastly greater mass, still\r\nretains an exceedingly high temperature. The reason for this can\r\nreadily be conceived by making a comparison of the rate of cooling\r\nwhich occurs in many of our ordinary experiences. Thus a vial of hot\r\nwater will quickly come down to the temperature of the air, while a\r\nlarge jug filled with the fluid at the same temperature will retain\r\nits heat many times as long. The reason for this rests upon the simple\r\nprinciple that the contents of a sphere increase with its enlargement\r\nmore rapidly than the surface through which the cooling takes place.\r\n\r\nThe modern studies on the physical history of the sun and other\r\ncelestial bodies show that their original store of heat is constantly\r\nflowing away into the empty realms of space. The rate at which this\r\nform of energy goes away from the sun is vast beyond the powers of the\r\nimagination to conceive; thus, in the case of our earth, which viewed\r\nfrom the sun would appear no more than a small star, the amount of\r\nheat which falls upon it from the great centre is enough each day to\r\nmelt, if it all could be put to such work, about eight thousand cubic\r\nmiles of ice. Yet the earth receives only 1/2,170,000,000 part of the\r\nsolar radiation. The greater part of this solar heat--in fact, we may\r\nsay nearly all of it--slips by the few and relatively small planets\r\nand disappears in the great void.\r\n\r\nThe destiny of all the celestial spheres seems in time to be that\r\nthey shall become cooled down to a temperature far below anything\r\nwhich is now experienced on this earth. Even the sun, though its heat\r\nwill doubtless endure for millions of years to come, must in time, so\r\nfar as we can see, become dark and cold. So far as we know, we can\r\nperceive no certain method by which the life of the slowly decaying\r\nsuns can be restored. It has, however, been suggested that in many\r\ncases a planetary system which has attained the lifeless and lightless\r\nstage may by collision with some other association of spheres be by\r\nthe blow restored to its previous state of vapour, the joint mass of\r\nthe colliding systems once again to resume the process of\r\nconcentration through which it had gone before. Now and then stars\r\nhave been seen to flash suddenly into great brilliancy in a way which\r\nsuggests that possibly their heat had been refreshed by a collision\r\nwith some great mass which had fallen into them from the celestial\r\nspaces. There is room for much speculation in this field, but no\r\ncertainty appears to be attainable.\r\n\r\nThe ancients believed that light and heat were emanations which were\r\ngiven off from the bodies that yielded them substantially as odours\r\nare given forth by many substances. Since the days of Newton inquiry\r\nhas forced us to the conviction that these effects of temperature are\r\nproduced by vibrations having the general character of waves, which\r\nare sent through the spaces with great celerity. When a ray of light\r\ndeparts from the sun or other luminous body, it does not convey any\r\npart of the mass; it transmits only motion. A conception of the action\r\ncan perhaps best be formed by suspending a number of balls of ivory,\r\nstone, or other hard substance each by a cord, the series so arranged\r\nthat they touch each other. Then striking a blow against one end of\r\nthe line, we observe that the ball at the farther end of the line is\r\nset in motion, swinging a little away from the place it occupied\r\nbefore. The movement of the intermediate balls may be so slight as to\r\nescape attention. We thus perceive that energy can be transmitted\r\nfrom one to another of these little spheres. Close observation shows\r\nus that under the impulse which the blow gives each separate body is\r\nmade to sway within itself much in the manner of a bell when it is\r\nrung, and that the movement is transmitted to the object with which it\r\nis in contact. In passing from the sun to the earth, the light and\r\nheat traverse a space which we know to be substantially destitute of\r\nany such materials as make up the mass of the earth or the sun. Judged\r\nby the standards which we can apply, this space must be essentially\r\nempty. Yet because motions go through it, we have to believe that it\r\nis occupied by something which has certain of the properties of\r\nmatter. It has, indeed, one of the most important properties of all\r\nsubstances, in that it can vibrate. This practically unknown thing is\r\ncalled ether.\r\n\r\nThe first important observational work done by the ancients led them\r\nto perceive that there was a very characteristic difference between\r\nthe planets and the fixed stars. They noted the fact that the planets\r\nwandered in a ceaseless way across the heavens, while the fixed stars\r\nshowed little trace of changing position in relation to one another.\r\nFor a long time it was believed that these, as well as the remoter\r\nfixed stars, revolved about the earth. This error, though great, is\r\nperfectly comprehensible, for the evident appearance of the movement\r\nis substantially what would be brought about if they really coursed\r\naround our sphere. It was only when the true nature of the earth and\r\nits relations to the sun were understood that men could correct this\r\nfirst view. It was not, indeed, until relatively modern times that the\r\nsolar system came to be perceived as something independent and widely\r\ndetached from the fixed stars system; that the spaces which separate\r\nthe members of our own solar family, inconceivably great as they are,\r\nare but trifling as compared with the intervals which part us from the\r\nnearer fixed stars. At this stage of our knowledge men came to the\r\nnoble suggestion that each of the fixed stars was itself a sun, each\r\nof the myriad probably attended by planetary bodies such as exist\r\nabout our own luminary.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for the student to take an imaginary journey from the\r\nsun forth into space, along the plane in which extends that vast\r\naggregation of stars which we term the Milky Way. Let him suppose that\r\nhis journey could be made with something like the speed of light, or,\r\nsay, at the rate of about two hundred thousand miles a second. It is\r\nfit that the imagination, which is free to go through all things,\r\nshould essay such excursions. On the fancied outgoing, the observer\r\nwould pass the interval between the sun and the earth in about eight\r\nminutes. It would require some hours before he attained to the outer\r\nlimit of the solar system. On his direct way he would pass the orbits\r\nof the several planets. Some would have their courses on one side or\r\nthe other of his path; we should say above or below, but for the fact\r\nthat we leave these terms behind in the celestial realm. On the margin\r\nof the solar system the sun would appear shrunken to the state where\r\nit was hardly greater than the more brilliant of the other fixed\r\nstars. The onward path would then lead through a void which it would\r\nrequire years to traverse. Gradually the sun which happened to lie\r\nmost directly in his path would grow larger; with nearer approach, it\r\nwould disclose its planets. Supposing that the way led through this\r\nsolar system, there would doubtless be revealed planets and satellites\r\nin their order somewhat resembling those of our own solar family, yet\r\nthere would doubtless be many surprises in the view. Arriving near the\r\nfirst sun to be visited, though the heavens would have changed their\r\nshape, all the existing constellations having altered with the change\r\nin the point of view, there would still be one familiar element in\r\nthat the new-found planets would be near by, and the nearest fixed\r\nstars far away in the firmament.\r\n\r\nWith the speed of light a stellar voyage could be taken along the path\r\nof the Milky Way, which would endure for thousands of years. Through\r\nall the course the journeyer would perceive the same vast girdle of\r\nstars, faint because they were far away, which gives the dim light of\r\nour galaxy. At no point is it probable that he would find the separate\r\nsuns much more aggregated or greatly farther apart than they are in\r\nthat part of the Milky Way which our sun now occupies. Looking forth\r\non either side of the \"galactic plane,\" there would be the same\r\nscattering of stars which we now behold when we gaze at right angles\r\nto the way we are supposing the spirit to traverse.\r\n\r\nAs the form of the Milky Way is irregular, the mass, indeed, having\r\ncertain curious divisions and branches, it well might be that the\r\nsupposed path would occasionally pass on one or the other side of the\r\nvast star layer. In such positions the eye would look forth into an\r\nempty firmament, except that there might be in the far away, tens of\r\nthousands of years perhaps at the rate that light travels away from\r\nthe observer, other galaxies or Milky Ways essentially like that which\r\nhe was traversing. At some point the journeyer would attain the margin\r\nof our star stratum, whence again he would look forth into the\r\nunpeopled heavens, though even there he might discern other remote\r\nstar groups separated from his own by great void intervals.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe revelations of the telescope show us certain features in the\r\nconstitution and movements of the fixed stars which now demand our\r\nattention. In the first place, it is plain that not all of these\r\nbodies are in the same physical condition. Though the greater part of\r\nthese distant luminous masses are evidently in the state of\r\naggregation displayed by our own sun, many of them retain more or less\r\nof that vaporous, it may be dustlike, character which we suppose to\r\nhave been the ancient state of all the matter in the universe. Some of\r\nthese masses appear as faint, almost indistinguishable clouds, which\r\neven to the greatest telescope and the best-trained vision show no\r\ndistinct features of structure. In other cases the nebulous\r\nappearance is hardly more than a mist about a tolerably distinct\r\ncentral star. Yet again, and most beautifully in the great nebula of\r\nthe constellation of Orion, the cloudy mass, though hardly visible to\r\nthe naked eye, shows a division into many separate parts, the whole\r\nappearing as if in process of concentration about many distinct\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\nThe nebulas are reasonably believed by many astronomers to be examples\r\nof the ancient condition of the physical universe, masses of matter\r\nwhich for some reason as yet unknown have not progressed in their\r\nconsolidation to the point where they have taken on the\r\ncharacteristics of suns and their attendant planets.\r\n\r\nMany of the fixed stars, the incomplete list of which now amounts to\r\nseveral hundred, are curiously variable in the amount of light which\r\nthey send out to the earth. Sometimes these variations are apparently\r\nirregular, but in the greater number of cases they have fixed periods,\r\nthe star waxing and waning at intervals varying from a few months to a\r\nfew years. Although some of the sudden flashings forth of stars from\r\napparent small size to near the greatest brilliancy may be due to\r\ncatastrophes such as might be brought about by the sudden falling in\r\nof masses of matter upon the luminous spheres, it is more likely that\r\nthe changes which we observe are due to the fact that two suns\r\nrevolving around a common centre are in different stages of\r\nextinction. It may well be that one of these orbs, presumably the\r\nsmaller, has so far lost temperature that it has ceased to glow. If in\r\nits revolution it regularly comes between the earth and its luminous\r\ncompanion, the effect would be to give about such a change in the\r\namount of light as we observe.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that a bright sun and a relatively dark sun might\r\nrevolve around a common centre of gravity may at first sight seem\r\nimprobable. The fact is, however, that imperfect as our observations\r\non the stars really are, we know many instances in which this kind of\r\nrevolution of one star about another takes place. In some cases these\r\nstars are of the same brilliancy, but in others one of the lights is\r\nmuch brighter than the other. From this condition to the state where\r\none of the stars is so nearly dark as to be invisible, the transition\r\nis but slight. In a word, the evidence goes to show that while we see\r\nonly the luminous orbs of space, the dark bodies which people the\r\nheavens are perhaps as numerous as those which send us light, and\r\ntherefore appear as stars.\r\n\r\nBesides the greater spheres of space, there is a vast host of lesser\r\nbodies, the meteorites and comets, which appear to be in part members\r\nof our solar system, and perhaps of other similar systems, and in part\r\nwanderers in the vast realm which intervenes between the solar\r\nsystems. Of these we will first consider the meteors, of which we know\r\nby far the most; though even of them, as we shall see, our knowledge\r\nis limited.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time on any starry night, and particularly in certain\r\nperiods of the year, we may behold, at the distance of fifty or more\r\nmiles above the surface of the earth, what are commonly called\r\n\"shooting stars.\" The most of these flashing meteors are evidently\r\nvery small, probably not larger than tiny sand grains, possibly no\r\ngreater than the fragments which would be termed dust. They enter the\r\nair at a speed of about thirty miles a second. They are so small that\r\nthey burn to vapour in the very great heat arising from their friction\r\non the air, and do not attain the surface of the earth. These are so\r\nnumerous that, on the average, some hundreds of thousands probably\r\nstrike the earth's atmosphere each day. From time to time larger\r\nbodies fall--bodies which are of sufficient bulk not to be burned up\r\nin the air, but which descend to the ground. These may be from the\r\nsmallest size which may be observed to masses of many hundred pounds\r\nin weight. These are far less numerous than the dust meteorites; it is\r\nprobable, however, that several hundred fragments each year attain the\r\nearth's surface. They come from various directions of space, and\r\nthere is as yet no means of determining whether they were formed in\r\nsome manner within our planetary system or whether they wander to us\r\nfrom remoter realms. We know that they are in part composed of\r\nmetallic iron commingled with nickel and carbon (sometimes as very\r\nsmall diamonds) in a way rarely if ever found on the surface of our\r\nsphere, and having a structure substantially unknown in its deposits.\r\nIn part they are composed of materials which somewhat resemble certain\r\nlavas. It is possible that these fragments of iron and stone which\r\nconstitute the meteorites have been thrown into the planetary spaces\r\nby the volcanic eruption of our own and other planets. If hurled forth\r\nwith a sufficient energy, the fragments would escape from the control\r\nof the attraction of the sphere whence they came, and would become\r\nindependent wanderers in space, moving around the sun in varied orbits\r\nuntil they were again drawn in by some of the greater planets.\r\n\r\nAs they come to us these meteorites often break up in the atmosphere,\r\nthe bits being scattered sometimes over a wide area of country. Thus,\r\nin the case of the Cocke County meteorite of Tennessee, one of the\r\niron species, the fragments, perhaps thousands in number, which came\r\nfrom the explosion of the body were scattered over an area of some\r\nthousand square miles. When they reach the surface in their natural\r\nform, these meteors always have a curious wasted and indented\r\nappearance, which makes it seem likely that they have been subject to\r\nfrequent collisions in their journeys after they were formed by some\r\nviolent rending action.\r\n\r\nIn some apparent kinship with the meteorites may be classed the\r\ncomets. The peculiarity of these bodies is that they appear in most\r\ncases to be more or less completely vaporous. Rushing down from the\r\ndepths of the heavens, these bodies commonly appear as faintly\r\nshining, cloudlike masses. As they move in toward the sun long trails\r\nof vapour stream back from the somewhat consolidated head. Swinging\r\naround that centre, they journey again into the outer realm. As they\r\nretreat, their tail-like streamers appear to gather again upon their\r\ncentres, and when they fade from view they are again consolidated. In\r\nsome cases it has been suspected that a part at least of the cometary\r\nmass was solid. The evidence goes to show, however, that the matter is\r\nin a dustlike or vaporous condition, and that the weight of these\r\nbodies is relatively very small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--The Great Comet of 1811, one of the many\r\nvaried forms of these bodies.]\r\n\r\nOwing to their strange appearance, comets were to the ancients omens\r\nof calamity. Sometimes they were conceived as flaming swords; their\r\nforms, indeed, lend themselves to this imagining. They were thought to\r\npresage war, famine, and the death of kings. Again, in more modern\r\ntimes, when they were not regarded as portents of calamity, it was\r\nfeared that these wanderers moving vagariously through our solar\r\nsystem might by chance come in contact with the earth with disastrous\r\nresults. Such collisions are not impossible, for the reason that the\r\nplanets would tend to draw these errant bodies toward them if they\r\ncame near their spheres; yet the chance of such collisions happening\r\nto the earth is so small that they may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MOTIONS OF THE SPHERES.\r\n\r\nAlthough little is known of the motions which occur among the\r\ncelestial bodies beyond the sphere of our solar family, that which has\r\nbeen ascertained is of great importance, and serves to make it likely\r\nthat all the suns in space are upon swift journeys which in their\r\nspeed equal, if they do not exceed, the rate of motion among the\r\nplanetary spheres, which may, in general, be reckoned at about twenty\r\nmiles a second. Our whole solar system is journeying away from certain\r\nstars, and in the direction of others which are situated in the\r\nopposite part of the heavens. The proof of this fact is found in the\r\nobservations which show that on one side of us the stars are\r\napparently coming closer together, while on the other side they are\r\ngoing farther apart. The phenomenon, in a word, is one of perspective,\r\nand may be made real to the understanding by noting what takes place\r\nwhen we travel down a street along which there are lights. We readily\r\nnote that these lights appear to close in behind us, and widen their\r\nintervals in the direction in which we journey. By such evidence\r\nastronomers have become convinced that our sphere, along with the sun\r\nwhich controls it, is each second a score of miles away from the point\r\nwhere it was before.\r\n\r\nThere is yet other and most curious evidence which serves to show that\r\ncertain of the stars are journeying toward our part of the heavens at\r\ngreat speed, while others are moving away from us by their own proper\r\nmotion. These indications are derived from the study of the lines in\r\nthe light which the spectrum reveals to us when critically examined.\r\nThe position of these cross lines is, as we know, affected by the\r\nmotion of the body whence the light comes, and by close analysis of\r\nthe facts it has been pretty well determined that the distortion in\r\ntheir positions is due to very swift motions of the several stars. It\r\nis not yet certain whether these movements of our sun and of other\r\nsolar bodies are in straight lines or in great circles.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that, although the evidence from the spectroscope\r\nserves to show that the matter in the stars is akin to that of our own\r\nearth, there is reason to believe that those great spheres differ much\r\nfrom each other in magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe have now set forth some of the important facts exhibited by the\r\nstellar universe. The body of details concerning that realm is vast,\r\nand the conclusions drawn from it important; only a part, however, of\r\nthe matter with which it deals is of a nature to be apprehended by the\r\nstudent who does not approach it in a somewhat professional way. We\r\nshall therefore now turn to a description of the portion of the starry\r\nworld which is found in the limits of our solar system. There the\r\ninfluences of the several spheres upon our planet are matters of vital\r\nimportance; they in a way affect, if they do not control, all the\r\noperations which go on upon the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the matter in the visible universe everywhere tends\r\nto gather into vast associations which appear to us as stars, and that\r\nthese orbs are engaged in ceaseless motion in journeys through space.\r\nIn only one of these aggregations--that which makes our own solar\r\nsystem--are the bodies sufficiently near to our eyes for us, even with\r\nthe resources of our telescopes and other instruments, to divine\r\nsomething of the details which they exhibit. In studying what we may\r\nconcerning the family of the sun, the planets, and their satellites,\r\nwe may reasonably be assured that we are tracing a history which with\r\nmany differences is in general repeated in the development of each\r\nstar in the firmament. Therefore the inquiry is one of vast range and\r\nimport.\r\n\r\nFollowing, as we may reasonably do, the nebular hypothesis--a view\r\nwhich, though not wholly proved, is eminently probable--we may regard\r\nour solar system as having begun when the matter of which it is\r\ncomposed, then in a finely divided, cloudy state, was separated from\r\nthe similar material which went to make the neighbouring fixed stars.\r\nThe period when our solar system began its individual life was remote\r\nbeyond the possibility of conception. Naturalists are pretty well\r\nagreed that living beings began to exist upon the earth at least a\r\nhundred million years ago; but the beginnings of our solar system must\r\nbe placed at a date very many times as remote from the present day.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Some astronomers, particularly the distinguished Professor\r\nNewcomb, hold that the sun can not have been supplying heat as at\r\npresent for more than about ten million years, and that all geological\r\ntime must be thus limited. The geologist believes that this reckoning is\r\nfar too short.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the nebular theory, the original vapour of the solar\r\nsystem began to fall in toward its centre and to whirl about that\r\npoint at a time long before the mass had shrunk to the present limits\r\nof the solar system as defined by the path of the outermost planets.\r\nAt successive stages of the concentration, rings after the manner of\r\nthose of Saturn separated from the disklike mass, each breaking up and\r\nconsolidating into a body of nebulous matter which followed in the\r\nsame path, generally forming rings which became by the same process\r\nthe moons or satellites of the sphere. In this way the sun produced\r\neight planets which are known, and possibly others of small size on\r\nthe outer verge of the system which have eluded discovery. According\r\nto this view, the planetary masses were born in succession, the\r\nfarthest away being the oldest. It is, however, held by an able\r\nauthority that the mass of the solar system would first form a rather\r\nflat disk, the several rings forming and breaking into planets at\r\nabout the same time. The conditions in Saturn, where the inner ring\r\nremains parted, favours the view just stated.\r\n\r\nBefore making a brief statement of the several planets, the asteroids,\r\nand the satellites, it will be well to consider in a general way the\r\nmotions of these bodies about their centres and about the sun. The\r\nmost characteristic and invariable of these movements is that by which\r\neach of the planetary spheres, as well as the satellites, describes an\r\norbit around the gravitative centre which has the most influence upon\r\nit--the sun. To conceive the nature of this movement, it will be well\r\nto imagine a single planet revolving around the sun, each of these\r\nbodies being perfect spheres, and the two the only members of the\r\nsolar system. In this condition the attraction of the two bodies would\r\ncause them to circle around a common centre of gravity, which, if the\r\nplanet were not larger or the sun smaller than is the case in our\r\nsolar system, would lie within the mass of the sun. In proportion as\r\nthe two bodies might approach each other in size, the centre of\r\ngravity would come the nearer to the middle point in a line connecting\r\nthe two spheres. In this condition of a sun with a single planet,\r\nwhatever were the relative size of sun and planet, the orbits which\r\nthey traverse would be circular. In this state of affairs it should be\r\nnoted that each of the two bodies would have its plane of rotation\r\npermanently in the same position. Even if the spheres were more or\r\nless flattened about the poles of their axes, as is the case with all\r\nthe planets which we have been able carefully to measure, as well as\r\nwith the sun, provided the axes of rotation were precisely parallel to\r\neach other, the mutual attraction of the masses would cause no\r\ndisturbance of the spheres. The same would be the case if the polar\r\naxis of one sphere stood precisely at right angles to that of the\r\nother. If, however, the spheres were somewhat flattened at the poles,\r\nand the axes inclined to each other, then the pull of one mass on the\r\nother would cause the polar axes to keep up a constant movement which\r\nis called nutation, or nodding.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this nodding movement of the polar axes would occur\r\nwhen these lines were inclined to each other is not difficult to see\r\nif we remember that the attraction of masses upon each other is\r\ninversely as the square of the distance; each sphere, pulling on the\r\nequatorial bulging of the other, pulls most effectively on the part of\r\nit which is nearest, and tends to draw it down toward its centre. The\r\nresult is that the axes of the attracted spheres are given a wobbling\r\nmovement, such as we may note in the spinning top, though in the toy\r\nthe cause of the motion is not that which we are considering.\r\n\r\nIf, now, in that excellent field for the experiment we are essaying,\r\nthe mind's eye, we add a second planet outside of the single sphere\r\nwhich we have so far supposed to journey about the sun, or rather\r\nabout the common centre of gravity, we perceive at once that we have\r\nintroduced an element which leads to a complication of much\r\nimportance. The new sphere would, of course, pull upon the others in\r\nthe measure of its gravitative value--i.e., its weight. The centre of\r\ngravity of the system would now be determined not by two distinct\r\nbodies, but by three. If we conceive the second planet to journey\r\naround the sun at such a rate that a straight line always connected\r\nthe centres of the three orbs, then the only effect on their\r\ngravitative centre would be to draw the first-mentioned planet a\r\nlittle farther away from the centre of the sun; but in our own solar\r\nsystem, and probably in all others, this supposition is inadmissible,\r\nbecause the planets have longer journeys to go and also move slower,\r\nthe farther they are from the sun. Thus Mercury completes the circle\r\nof its year in eighty-eight of our days, while the outermost planet\r\nrequires sixty thousand days (more than one hundred and sixty-four\r\nyears) for the same task. The result is not only that the centre of\r\ngravity of the system is somewhat displaced--itself a matter of no\r\ngreat account--but also that the orbit of the original planet ceases\r\nto be circled and becomes elliptical, and this for the evident reason\r\nthat the sphere will be drawn somewhat away from the sun when the\r\nsecond planet happens to lie in the part of its orbit immediately\r\noutside of its position, in which case the pull is away from the solar\r\ncentre; while, on the other hand, when the new planet was on the other\r\nside of the sun, its pull would serve to intensify the attraction\r\nwhich drew the first sphere toward the centre of gravity. As the\r\npulling action of the three bodies upon each other, as well as upon\r\ntheir equatorial protuberances, would vary with every change in their\r\nrelative position, however slight, the variations in the form of their\r\norbits, even if the spheres were but three in number, would be very\r\nimportant. The consequences of these perturbations will appear in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nIn our solar system, though there are but eight great planets, the\r\ngroup of asteroids, and perhaps a score of satellites, the variety of\r\norbital and axial movement which is developed taxes the computing\r\ngenius of the ablest astronomer. The path which our earth follows\r\naround the sun, though it may in general and for convenience be\r\ndescribed as a variable ellipse, is, in fact, a line of such\r\ncomplication that if we should essay a diagram of it on the scale of\r\nthis page it would not be possible to represent any considerable part\r\nof its deviations. These, in fact, would elude depiction, even if the\r\ndraughtsman had a sheet for his drawing as large as the orbit itself,\r\nfor every particle of matter in space, even if it be lodged beyond the\r\nlimits of the farthest stars revealed to us by the telescope,\r\nexercises a certain attraction, which, however small, is effective on\r\nthe mass of the earth. Science has to render its conclusions in\r\ngeneral terms, and we can safely take them as such; but in this, as in\r\nother instances, it is well to qualify our acceptance of the\r\nstatements by the memory that all things are infinitely more\r\ncomplicated than we can possibly conceive or represent them to be.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the rotations of the planetary spheres upon\r\ntheir axes, together with the similar movement, or lack of it, in the\r\ncase of their satellites. This rotation, according to the nebular\r\nhypothesis, may be explained by the movements which would set up in\r\nthe share of matter which was at first a ring of the solar nebula, and\r\nwhich afterward gathered into the planetary aggregation. The way of it\r\nmay be briefly set forth as follows: Such a ring doubtless had a\r\ndiameter of some million miles; we readily perceive that the particles\r\nof matter in the outer part of the belt would have a swifter movement\r\naround the sun than those on the inside. When by some disturbance, as\r\npossibly by the passage of a great meteoric body of a considerable\r\ngravitative power, this ring was broken in two, the particles\r\ncomposing it on either side would, because of their mutual attraction,\r\ntend to draw away from the breach, widening that gap until the matter\r\nof the broken ring was aggregated into a sphere of the star dust or\r\nvapour. When the nebulous matter originally in the ring became\r\naggregated into a spherical form, it would, on account of the\r\ndifferent rates at which the particles were moving when they came\r\ntogether, be the surer to fall in toward the centre, not in straight\r\nlines, but in curves--in other words, the mass would necessarily take\r\non a movement of rotation essentially like that which we have\r\ndescribed in setting forth the nebular hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the stages of concentration the planetary nebulæ might well repeat\r\nthose through which the greater solar mass proceeded. If the volume of\r\nthe material were great, subordinate rings would be formed, which when\r\nthey broke and concentrated would constitute secondary planets or\r\nsatellites, such as our moon. For some reason as yet unknown the outer\r\nplanets--in fact, all those in the solar system except the two inner,\r\nVenus and Mercury and the asteroids--formed such attendants. All these\r\nsatellite-forming rings have broken and concentrated except the inner\r\nof Saturn, which remains as an intellectual treasure of the solar\r\nsystem to show the history of its development.\r\n\r\nTo the student who is not seeking the fulness of knowledge which\r\nastronomy has to offer, but desires only to acquaint himself with the\r\nmore critical and important of the heavenly phenomena which help to\r\nexplain the earth, these features of planetary movement should prove\r\nespecially interesting for the reason that they shape the history of\r\nthe spheres. As we shall hereafter see, the machinery of the earth's\r\nsurface, all the life which it bears, its winds and rains--everything,\r\nindeed, save the actions which go on in the depths of the sphere--is\r\ndetermined by the heat and light which come from the sun. The\r\nconditions under which this vivifying tide is received have their\r\norigin in the planetary motion. If our earth's path around the centre\r\nof the system was a perfect circle, and if its polar axis lay at right\r\nangles to the plane of its journey, the share of light and heat which\r\nwould fall upon any one point on the sphere would be perfectly\r\nuniform. There would be no variations in the length of day or night;\r\nno changes in the seasons; the winds everywhere would blow with\r\nexceeding steadiness--in fact, the present atmospheric confusion would\r\nbe reduced to something like order. From age to age, except so far as\r\nthe sun itself might vary in the amount of energy which it radiated,\r\nor lands rose up into the air or sunk down toward the sea level, the\r\nclimate of each region would be perfectly stable. In the existing\r\nconditions the influences bring about unending variety. First of all,\r\nthe inclined position of the polar axis causes the sun apparently to\r\nmove across the heavens, so that it comes in an overhead position once\r\nor twice in the year in quite half the area of the lands and seas.\r\nThis apparent swaying to and fro of the sun, due to the inclination of\r\nthe axis of rotation, also affects the width of the climatal belts on\r\neither side of the equator, so that all parts of the earth receive a\r\nconsiderable share of the sun's influence. If the axis of the earth's\r\nrotation were at right angles to the plane of its orbit, there would\r\nbe a narrow belt of high temperature about the equator, north and\r\nsouth of which the heat would grade off until at about the parallels\r\nof fifty degrees we should find a cold so considerable and uniform\r\nthat life would probably fade away; and from those parallels to the\r\npoles the conditions would be those of permanent frost, and of days\r\nwhich would darken into the enduring night or twilight in the realm\r\nof the far north and south. Thus the wide habitability of the earth is\r\nan effect arising from the inclination of its polar axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Inclination of Planetary Orbits (from\r\nChambers).]\r\n\r\nAs the most valuable impression which the student can receive from his\r\nstudy of Nature is that sense of the order which has made possible all\r\nlife, including his own, it will be well for him to imagine, as he may\r\nreadily do, what would be the effect arising from changes in relations\r\nof earth and sun. Bringing the earth's axis in imagination into a\r\nposition at right angles to the plane of the orbit, he will see that\r\nthe effect would be to intensify the equatorial heat, and to rob the\r\nhigh latitudes of the share which they now have. On moving the axis\r\ngradually to positions where it approaches the plane of the orbit, he\r\nwill note that each stage of the change widens the tropic belt.\r\nBringing the polar axis down to the plane of the orbit, one hemisphere\r\nwould receive unbroken sunshine, the other remaining in perpetual\r\ndarkness and cold. In this condition, in place of an equatorial line\r\nwe should have an equatorial point at the pole nearest the sun; thence\r\nthe temperatures would grade away to the present equator, beyond which\r\nhalf the earth would be in more refrigerating condition than are the\r\npoles at the present day. In considering the movements of our planet,\r\nwe shall see that no great changes in the position of the polar axis\r\ncan have taken place. On this account the suggested alterations of the\r\naxis should not be taken as other than imaginary changes.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that with a circular orbit and with an inclined axis\r\nwinter and summer would normally come always at the same point in the\r\norbit, and that these seasons would be of perfectly even length. But,\r\nas we have before noted, the earth's path around the sun is in its\r\nform greatly affected by the attractions which are exercised by the\r\nneighbouring planets, principally by those great spheres which lie in\r\nthe realm without its orbit, Jupiter and Saturn. When these attracting\r\nbodies, as is the case from time to time, though at long intervals,\r\nare brought together somewhere near to that part of the solar system\r\nin which the earth is moving around the sun, they draw our planet\r\ntoward them, and so make its path very elliptical. When, however, they\r\nare so distributed that their pulling actions neutralize each other,\r\nthe orbit returns more nearly to a circular form. The range in its\r\neccentricity which can be brought about by these alterations is very\r\ngreat. When the path is most nearly circular, the difference in the\r\nmajor and minor axis may amount to as little as about five hundred\r\nthousand miles, or about one one hundred and eighty-sixth of its\r\naverage diameter. When the variation is greatest the difference in\r\nthese measurements may be as much as near thirteen million miles, or\r\nabout one seventh of the mean width of the orbit.\r\n\r\nThe first and most evident effect arising from these changes of the\r\norbit comes from the difference in the amount of heat which the earth\r\nmay receive according as it is nearer or farther from the sun. As in\r\nthe case of other fires, the nearer a body is to it the larger the\r\nshare of light and heat which it will receive. In an orbit made\r\nelliptical by the planetary attraction the sun necessarily occupies\r\none of the foci of the ellipse. The result is, of course, that the\r\nside of the earth which is toward the sun, while it is thus brought\r\nthe nearer to the luminary, receives more energy in the form of light\r\nand heat than come to any part which is exposed when the spheres are\r\nfarther away from each other in the other part of the orbit.\r\nComputations clearly show that the total amount of heat and the\r\nattendant light which the earth receives in a year is not affected by\r\nthese changes in the form of its path. While it is true that it\r\nreceives heat more rapidly in the half of the ellipse which is nearest\r\nthe source of the inundation, it obtains less while it is farther\r\naway, and these two variations just balance each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough the alterations in the eccentricity of its orbit do not vary\r\nthe annual supply of heat which the earth receives, they are capable\r\nof changing the character of the seasons, and this in the way which we\r\nwill now endeavour to set forth, though we must do it at the cost of\r\nconsiderable attention on the part of the reader, for the facts are\r\nsomewhat complicated. In the first place, we must note that the\r\nellipticity of the earth's orbit is not developed on fixed lines, but\r\nis endlessly varied, as we can readily imagine it would be for the\r\nreason that its form depends upon the wandering of the outer planetary\r\nspheres which pull the earth about. The longer axis of the ellipse is\r\nitself in constant motion in the direction in which the earth travels.\r\nThis movement is slow, and at an irregular rate. It is easy to see\r\nthat the effect of this action, which is called the revolution of the\r\napsides, or, as the word means, the movement of the poles of the\r\nellipse, is to bring the earth, when a given hemisphere is turned\r\ntoward the sun, sometimes in the part of the orbit which is nearest\r\nthe source of light and heat, and sometimes farther away. It may thus\r\nwell come about that at one time the summer season of a hemisphere\r\narrives when it is nearest the sun, so that the season, though hot,\r\nwill be very short, while at another time the same season will arrive\r\nwhen the earth is farthest from the sun, and receives much less heat,\r\nwhich would tend to make a long and relatively cool summer. The reason\r\nfor the difference in length of the seasons is to be found in the\r\nrelative swiftness of the earth's revolution when it is nearest the\r\nsun, and the slowness when it is farther away.\r\n\r\nThere is a further complication arising from that curious phenomenon\r\ncalled the precession of the equinoxes, which has to be taken into\r\naccount before we can sufficiently comprehend the effect of the\r\nvarying eccentricity of the orbit on the earth's seasons. To\r\nunderstand this feature of precession we should first note that it\r\nmeans that each year the change from the winter to the summer--or, as\r\nwe phrase it, the passage of the equinoctial line--occurs a little\r\nsooner than the year before. The cause of this is to be found in the\r\nattraction which the heavenly bodies, practically altogether the moon,\r\nexercises on the equatorial protuberance of the earth. We know that\r\nthe diameter of our sphere at the equator is, on the average,\r\nsomething more than twenty-six miles greater than it is through the\r\npoles. We know, furthermore, that the position of the moon in relation\r\nto the earth is such that it causes the attraction on one half of this\r\nprotuberance to be greater than it is upon the other. We readily\r\nperceive that this action will cause the polar axis to make a certain\r\nrevolution, or, what comes to the same thing, that the plane of the\r\nequator will constantly be altering its position. Now, as the\r\nequinoctial points in the orbit depend for their position upon the\r\nattitude of the equatorial plane, we can conceive that the effect is a\r\nchange in position of the place in that orbit where summer and winter\r\nbegin. The actual result is to bring the seasonal points backward,\r\nstep by step, through the orbit in a regular measure until in\r\ntwenty-two thousand five hundred years they return to the place where\r\nthey were before. This cycle of change was of old called the Annus\r\nMagnus, or great year.\r\n\r\nIf the earth's orbit were an ellipse, the major axis of which remained\r\nin the same position, we could readily reckon all the effects which\r\narise from the variations of the great year. But this ellipse is ever\r\nchanging in form, and in the measure of its departure from a circle\r\nthe effects on the seasons distributed over a great period of time are\r\nexceedingly irregular. Now and then, at intervals of hundreds of\r\nthousands or millions of years, the orbit becomes very elliptical;\r\nthen again for long periods it may in form approach a circle. When in\r\nthe state of extreme ellipticity, the precession of the equinoxes will\r\ncause the hemispheres in turn each to have their winter and summer\r\nalternately near and far from the sun. It is easily seen that when the\r\nsummer season comes to a hemisphere in the part of the orbit which is\r\nthen nearest the sun the period will be very hot. When the summer\r\ncame farthest from the sun that part of the year would have the\r\ntemperature mitigated by its removal to a greater distance from the\r\nsource of heat. A corresponding effect would be produced in the winter\r\nseason. As long as the orbit remained eccentric the tendency would be\r\nto give alternately intense seasons to each hemisphere through periods\r\nof about twelve thousand years, the other hemisphere having at the\r\nsame time a relatively slight variation in the summer and winter.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it may seem to the reader that these studies we have\r\njust been making in matters concerning the shape of the orbit and the\r\nattendant circumstances which regulate the seasons were of no very\r\ngreat consequence; but, in the opinion of some students of climate, we\r\nare to look to these processes for an explanation of certain climatal\r\nchanges on the earth, including the Glacial periods, accidents which\r\nhave had the utmost importance in the history of man, as well as of\r\nall the other life of the planet.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to give some account as to what is known concerning the\r\ngeneral conditions of the solar bodies--the planets and satellites of\r\nour own celestial group. For our purpose we need attend only to the\r\ngeneral physical state of these orbs so far as it is known to us by\r\nthe studies of astronomers. The nearest planet to the sun is Mercury.\r\nThis little sphere, less than half the diameter of our earth, is so\r\nclose to the sun that even when most favourably placed for observation\r\nit is visible for but a few minutes before sunrise and after sunset.\r\nAlthough it may without much difficulty be found by the ordinary eye,\r\nvery few people have ever seen it. To the telescope when it is in the\r\n_full moon_ state it appears as a brilliant disk; it is held by most\r\nastronomers that the surface which we see is made up altogether of\r\nclouds, but this, as most else that has been stated concerning this\r\nplanet, is doubtful. The sphere is so near to the sun that if it were\r\npossessed of water it would inevitably bear an atmosphere full of\r\nvapour. Under any conceivable conditions of a planet placed as\r\nMercury is, provided it had an atmosphere to retain the heat, its\r\ntemperature would necessarily be very high. Life as we know it could\r\nnot well exist upon such a sphere.\r\n\r\nNext beyond Mercury is Venus, a sphere only a little less in diameter\r\nthan the earth. Of this sphere we know more than we do of Mercury, for\r\nthe reason that it is farther from the sun and so appears in the\r\ndarkened sky. Most astronomers hold that the surface of this planet\r\napparently is almost completely and continually hidden from us by what\r\nappears to be a dense cloud envelope, through which from time to time\r\ncertain spots appear of a dark colour. These, it is claimed, retain\r\ntheir place in a permanent way; it is, indeed, by observing them that\r\nthe rotation period of the planet has, according to some observers,\r\nbeen determined. It therefore seems likely that these spots are the\r\nsummits of mountains, which, like many of our own earth, rise above\r\nthe cloud level.\r\n\r\nRecent observations on Venus made by Mr. Percival Lowell appear to\r\nshow that the previous determinations of the rotation of that planet,\r\nas well as regards its cloud wrap, are in error. According to these\r\nobservations, the sphere moves about the sun, always keeping the same\r\nside turned toward the solar centre, just as the moon does in its\r\nmotion around the earth. Moreover, Mr. Lowell has failed to discover\r\nany traces of clouds upon the surface of the planet. As yet these\r\nresults have not been verified by the work of other astronomers;\r\nresting, however, as they do on studies made with an excellent\r\ntelescope and in the very translucent and steady air of the Flagstaff\r\nStation, they are more likely to be correct than those obtained by\r\nother students. If it be true that Venus does not turn upon its axis,\r\nsuch is likely to be the case also with the planet Mercury.\r\n\r\nNext in the series of the planets is our own earth. As the details of\r\nthis planet are to occupy us during nearly all the remainder of this\r\nwork, we shall for the present pass it by.\r\n\r\nBeyond the earth we pass first to the planet Mars, a sphere which has\r\nalready revealed to us much concerning its peculiarities of form and\r\nphysical state, and which is likely in the future to give more\r\ninformation than we shall obtain from any other of our companions in\r\nspace, except perhaps the moon. Mars is not only nearer to us than any\r\nother planet, but it is so placed that it receives the light of the\r\nsun under favourable conditions for our vision. Moreover, its sky\r\nappears to be generally almost cloudless, so that when in its orbital\r\ncourse the sphere is nearest our earth it is under favourable\r\nconditions for telescopic observation. At such times there is revealed\r\nto the astronomer a surface which is covered with an amazing number of\r\nshadings and markings which as yet have been incompletely interpreted.\r\nThe faint nature of these indications has led to very contradictory\r\nstatements as to their form; no two maps which have been drawn agree\r\nexcept in their generalities. There is reason to believe that Mars has\r\nan atmosphere; this is shown by the fact that in the appropriate\r\nseason the region about either pole is covered by a white coating,\r\npresumably snow. This covering extends rather less far toward the\r\nplanet's equator than does the snow sheet on our continents. Taking\r\ninto account the colour of the coating, and the fact that it\r\ndisappears when the summer season comes to the hemisphere in which it\r\nwas formed, we are, in fact, forced to believe that the deposit is\r\nfrozen water, though it has been suggested that it may be frozen\r\ncarbonic acid. Taken in connection with what we have shortly to note\r\nconcerning the apparent seas of this sphere, the presumption is\r\noverwhelmingly to the effect that Mars has seasons not unlike our own.\r\n\r\nThe existence of snow on any sphere may safely be taken as evidence\r\nthat there is an atmosphere. In the case of Mars, this supposition is\r\nborne out by the appearance of its surface. The ruddy light which it\r\nsends back to us, and the appearance on the margin of the sphere,\r\nwhich is somewhat dim, appears to indicate that its atmosphere is\r\ndense. In fact, the existence of an atmosphere much denser than that\r\nof our own earth appears to be demanded by the fact that the\r\ntemperatures are such as to permit the coming and going of snow. It is\r\nwell known that the temperature of any point on the earth, other\r\nthings being equal, is proportionate to the depth of atmosphere above\r\nits surface. If Mars had no more air over its surface than has an\r\nequal area of the earth, it would remain at a temperature so low that\r\nsuch seasonal changes as we have observed could not take place. The\r\nplanet receives one third less heat than an equal area of the earth,\r\nand its likeness to our own temperature, if such exists, is doubtless\r\nbrought about by the greater density of its atmosphere, that serves to\r\nretain the heat which comes upon its surface. The manner in which this\r\nis effected will be set forth in the study of the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Mars, August 27, 1892 (Guiot), the white patch\r\nis the supposed Polar Snow Cap.]\r\n\r\nAs is shown by the maps of Mars, the surface is occupied by shadings\r\nwhich seem to indicate the existence of water and lands. Those\r\nportions of the area which are taken to be land are very much divided\r\nby what appear to be narrow seas. The general geographic conditions\r\ndiffer much from those of our own sphere in that the parts of the\r\nplanet about the water level are not grouped in great continents, and\r\nthere are no large oceans. The only likeness to the conditions of our\r\nearth which we can perceive is in a general pointing of the somewhat\r\ntriangular masses of what appears to be land toward one pole. As a\r\nwhole, the conditions of the Martial lands and seas as regards their\r\nform, at least, is more like that of Europe than that of any other\r\npart of the earth's surface. Europe in the early Tertiary times had a\r\nconfiguration even more like that of Mars than it exhibits at present,\r\nfor in that period the land was very much more divided than it now is.\r\n\r\nIf the lands of Mars are framed as are those of our own earth, there\r\nshould be ridges of mountains constituting what we may term the\r\nbackbones of the continent. As yet such have not been discerned, which\r\nmay be due to the fact that they have not been carefully looked for.\r\nThe only peculiar physical features which have as yet been discerned\r\non the lands of Mars are certain long, straight, rather narrow\r\ncrevicelike openings, which have received the name of \"canals.\" These\r\nfeatures are very indistinct, and are just on the limit of visibility.\r\nAs yet they have been carefully observed by but few students, so that\r\ntheir features are not yet well recorded; as far as we know them,\r\nthese fissures have no likeness in the existing conditions of our\r\nearth. It is difficult to understand how they are formed or preserved\r\non a surface which is evidently subjected to rainfalls.\r\n\r\nIt will require much more efficient telescopes than we now have before\r\nit will be possible to begin any satisfactory study on the geography\r\nof this marvellous planet. We can not hope as yet to obtain any\r\nindications as to the details of its structure; we can not see closely\r\nenough to determine whether rivers exist, or whether there is a\r\ncoating which we may interpret as vegetation, changing its hues in the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year. An advance in our instruments of\r\nresearch during the coming century, if made with the same speed as\r\nduring the last, will perhaps enable us to interpret the nature of\r\nthis neighbour, and thereby to extend the conception of planetary\r\nhistories which we derive from our own earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Comparative Sizes of the Planets (Chambers).]\r\n\r\nBeyond Mars we find one of the most singular features of our solar\r\nsystem in a group of small planetary bodies, the number of which now\r\nknown amounts to some two hundred, and the total may be far greater.\r\nThese bodies are evidently all small; it is doubtful if the largest is\r\nthree hundred and the smaller more than twenty miles in diameter. So\r\nfar as it has been determined by the effect of their aggregate mass in\r\nattracting the other spheres, they would, if put together, make a\r\nsphere far less in diameter than our earth, perhaps not more than five\r\nhundred miles through. The forms of these asteroids is as yet unknown;\r\nwe therefore can not determine whether their shapes are spheroidal, as\r\nare those of the other planets, or whether they are angular bits like\r\nthe meteorites. We are thus not in a position to conjecture whether\r\ntheir independence began when the nebulous matter of the ring to which\r\nthey belonged was in process of consolidation, or whether, after the\r\naggregation of the sphere was accomplished, and the matter solidified,\r\nthe mass was broken into bits in some way which we can not yet\r\nconceive. It has been conjectured that such a solid sphere might have\r\nbeen driven asunder by a collision with some wandering celestial body;\r\nbut all we can conceive of such actions leads us to suppose that a\r\nblow of this nature would tend to melt or convert materials subjected\r\nto it into the state of vapour, rather than to drive them asunder in\r\nthe manner of an explosion.\r\n\r\nThe four planets which lie beyond the asteroids give us relatively\r\nlittle information concerning their physical condition, though they\r\nafford a wide field for the philosophic imagination. From this point\r\nof view the reader is advised to consult the writings of the late R.A.\r\nProctor, who has brought to the task of interpreting the planetary\r\nconditions the skill of a well-trained astronomer and a remarkable\r\nconstructive imagination.\r\n\r\nThe planet Jupiter, by far the largest of the children of the sun,\r\nappears to be still in a state where its internal heat has not so far\r\nescaped that the surface has cooled down in the manner of our earth.\r\nWhat appear to be good observations show that the equatorial part of\r\nits area, at least, still glows from its own heat. The sphere is\r\ncloud-wrapped, but it is doubtful whether the envelope be of watery\r\nvapour; it is, indeed, quite possible that besides such vapour it may\r\ncontain some part of the many substances which occupy the atmosphere\r\nof the sun. If the Jovian sphere were no larger than the earth, it\r\nwould, on account of its greater age, long ago have parted with its\r\nheat; but on account of its great size it has been able,\r\nnotwithstanding its antiquity, to retain a measure of temperature\r\nwhich has long since passed away from our earth.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Saturn, the cloud bands are somewhat less visible than\r\non Jupiter, but there is reason to suppose in this, as in the\r\nlast-named planet, that we do not behold the more solid surface of the\r\nsphere, but see only a cloud wrap, which is probably due rather to the\r\nheat of the sphere itself than to that which comes to it from the sun.\r\nAt the distance of Saturn from the centre of the solar system a given\r\narea of surface receives less than one ninetieth of the sun's heat as\r\ncompared with the earth; therefore we can not conceive that any\r\ndensity of the atmosphere whatever would suffice to hold in enough\r\ntemperature to produce ordinary clouds. Moreover, from time to time\r\nbright spots appear on the surface of the planet, which must be due to\r\nsome form of eruptions from its interior.\r\n\r\nBeyond Saturn the two planets Uranus and Neptune, which occupy the\r\nouter part of the solar system, are so remote that even our best\r\ntelescopes discern little more than their presence, and the fact that\r\nthey have attendant moons.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of astronomical science, the outermost planet\r\nNeptune, of peculiar interest for the reason that it was, as we may\r\nsay, discovered by computation. Astronomers had for many years\r\nremarked the fact that the next inner planetary sphere exhibited\r\npeculiarities in its orbit which could only be accounted for on the\r\nsupposition that it was subjected to the attraction of another\r\nwandering body which had escaped observation. By skilful computation\r\nthe place in the heavens in which this disturbing element lay was so\r\naccurately determined that when the telescope was turned to the given\r\nfield a brief study revealed the planet. Nothing else in the history\r\nof the science of astronomy, unless it be the computation of eclipses,\r\nso clearly and popularly shows the accuracy of the methods by which\r\nthe work of that science may be done.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see hereafter, in the chapters which are devoted to\r\nterrestrial phenomena, the physical condition of the sun determines\r\nthe course of all the more important events which take place on the\r\nsurface of the earth. It is therefore fit that in this preliminary\r\nstudy of the celestial bodies, which is especially designed to make\r\nthe earth more interpretable to us, we should give a somewhat special\r\nattention to what is known under the title of \"Solar Physics.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader has already been told that the sun is one of many million\r\nsimilar bodies which exist in space, and, furthermore, that these\r\naggregations of matter have been developed from an original nebulous\r\ncondition. The facts indicate that the natural history of the sun, as\r\nwell as that of its attendant spheres, exhibits three momentous\r\nstages: First, that of vapour; second, that of igneous fluidity;\r\nthird, that in which the sphere is so far congealed that it becomes\r\ndark. Neither of these states is sharply separated from the other; a\r\nmass may be partly nebulous and partly fluid; even when it has been\r\nconverted into fluid, or possibly into the solid state, it may still\r\nretain on the exterior some share of its original vaporous condition.\r\nIn our sun the concentration has long since passed beyond the limits\r\nof the nebulous state; the last of the successively developed rings\r\nhas broken, and has formed itself into the smallest of the planets,\r\nwhich by its distance from the sun seems to indicate that the process\r\nof division by rings long ago attained in our solar system its end,\r\nthe remainder of its nebulous material concentrating on its centre\r\nwithout sign of any remaining tendency to produce these planet-making\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nBefore the use of the telescope in astronomical work, which was begun\r\nby the illustrious Galileo in 1608, astronomers were unable to\r\napproach the problem of the structure of the sun. They could discern\r\nno more than can be seen by any one who looks at the great sphere\r\nthrough a bit of smoked glass, as we know this reveals a disklike body\r\nof very uniform appearance. The only variation in this simple aspect\r\noccurs at the time of a total eclipse, when for a minute or two the\r\nmoon hides the whole body of the sun. On such occasions even the\r\nunaided eye can see that there is about the sphere a broad, rather\r\nbright field, of an aspect like a very thin cloud or fog, which rises\r\nin streamer like projections at points to a quarter of a million miles\r\nor more above the surface of the sphere. The appearance of this\r\nshining field, which is called the corona, reminds one of the aurora\r\nwhich glows in the region about either pole of the earth.\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the invention of the telescope was the\r\nrevelation of the curious dark objects on the sun's disk, known by the\r\nname of spots from the time of their discovery, or, at least, from the\r\ntime when it was clearly perceived that they were not planets, but\r\nreally on the solar body. The interest in the constitution of the\r\nsphere has increased during the last fifty years. This interest has\r\nrapidly grown until at the present time a vast body of learning has\r\nbeen gathered for the solution of the many problems concerning the\r\ncentre of our system. As yet there is great divergence in the views of\r\nastronomers as to the interpretation of their observations, but\r\ncertain points of great general interest have been tolerably well\r\ndetermined. These may be briefly set forth by an account of what would\r\nmeet the eye if an observer were able to pass from the surface of the\r\nearth to the central part of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Lava stream, in Hawaiian Islands, flowing into the\r\nsea. Note the \"ropy\" character of the half-frozen rock on the sides of\r\nthe nearest rivulet of the lava._]\r\n\r\nIn passing from the earth to a point about a quarter of a million\r\nmiles from the sun's surface--a distance about that of the moon from\r\nour sphere--the observer would traverse the uniformly empty spaces of\r\nthe heavens, where, but for the rare chance of a passing meteorite or\r\ncomet, there would be nothing that we term matter. Arriving at a point\r\nsome two or three hundred thousand miles from the body of the sun, he\r\nwould enter the realm of the corona; here he would find scattered\r\nparticles of matter, the bits so far apart that there would perhaps be\r\nnot more than one or two in the cubic mile; yet, as they would glow\r\nintensely in the central light, they would be sufficient to give the\r\nillumination which is visible in an eclipse. These particles are most\r\nlikely driven up from the sun by some electrical action, and are\r\nconstantly in motion, much as are the streamers of the aurora.\r\n\r\nBelow the corona and sharply separated from it the observer finds\r\nanother body of very dense vapour, which is termed the chromosphere,\r\nand which has been regarded as the atmosphere of the sun. This layer\r\nis probably several thousand miles thick. From the manner in which it\r\nmoves, in the way the air of our own planet does in great storms, it\r\nis not easy to believe that it is a fluid, yet its sharply defined\r\nupper surface leads us to suppose that it can not well be a mere mass\r\nof vapour. The spectroscope shows us that this chromosphere contains\r\nin the state of vapour a number of metallic substances, such as iron\r\nand magnesium. To an observer who could behold this envelope of the\r\nsun from the distance at which we see the moon, the spectacle would be\r\nmore magnificent than the imagination, guided by the sight of all the\r\nrelatively trifling fractures of our earth, can possibly conceive.\r\nFrom the surface of the fiery sea vast uprushes of heated matter rise\r\nto the height of two or three hundred thousand miles, and then fall\r\nback upon its surface. These jets of heated matter have the aspect of\r\nflames, but they would not be such in fact, for the materials are not\r\nburning, but merely kept at a high temperature by the heat of the\r\ngreat sphere beneath. They spring up with such energy that they at\r\ntimes move with a speed of one hundred and fifty miles a second, or at\r\na rate which is attained by no other matter in the visible universe,\r\nexcept that strange, wandering star known to astronomers as\r\n\"Grombridge, 1830,\" which is traversing the firmament with a speed of\r\nnot less than two hundred miles a second.\r\n\r\nBelow the chromosphere is the photosphere, the lower envelope of the\r\nsun, if it be not indeed the body of the sphere itself; from this\r\ncomes the light and heat of the mass. This, too, can not well be a\r\nfirm-set mass, for the reason that the spots appear to form in and\r\nmove over it. It may be regarded as an extremely dense mass of gas, so\r\nweighed down by the vast attraction of the great sphere below it that\r\nit is in effect a fluid. The near-at-hand observer would doubtless\r\nfind this photosphere, as it appears in the telescope, to be sharply\r\nseparated from the thinner and more vaporous envelopes--the\r\nchromosphere and the corona--which are, indeed, so thin that they are\r\ninvisible even with the telescope, except when the full blaze of the\r\nsun is cut off in a total eclipse. The fact that the photosphere,\r\nexcept when broken by the so-called spots, lies like a great smooth\r\nsea, with no parts which lie above the general line, shows that it has\r\na very different structure from the envelope which lies upon it. If\r\nthey were both vaporous, there would be a gradation between them.\r\n\r\nOn the surface of the photosphere, almost altogether within thirty\r\ndegrees of the equator of the sun, a field corresponding approximately\r\nto the tropical belt of the earth, there appear from time to time the\r\ncurious disturbances which are termed spots. These appear to be\r\nuprushes of matter in the gaseous state, the upward movement being\r\nupon the margins of the field and a downward motion taking place in\r\nthe middle of the irregular opening, which is darkened in its central\r\npart, thus giving it, when seen by an ordinary telescope, the aspect\r\nof a black patch on the glowing surface. These spots, which are from\r\nsome hundred to some thousand miles in diameter, may endure for\r\nmonths before they fade away. It is clear that they are most abundant\r\nat intervals of about eleven years, the last period of abundance being\r\nin 1893. The next to come may thus be expected in 1904. In the times\r\nof least spotting more than half the days of a year may pass without\r\nthe surface of the photosphere being broken, while in periods of\r\nplenty no day in the year is likely to fail to show them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Ordinary Sun-spot, June 22, 1885.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if the closest seeing would reveal the cause of the\r\nsolar spots. The studies of the physicists who have devoted the most\r\nskill to the matter show little more than that they are tumults in the\r\nphotosphere, attended by an uprush of vapours, in which iron and other\r\nmetals exist; but whether these movements are due to outbreaks from\r\nthe deeper parts of the sun or to some action like the whirling storms\r\nof the earth's atmosphere is uncertain. It is also uncertain what\r\neffect these convulsions of the sun have on the amount of the heat and\r\nlight which is poured forth from the orb. The common opinion that the\r\nsun-spot years are the hottest is not yet fully verified.\r\n\r\nBelow the photosphere lies the vast unknown mass of the unseen solar\r\nrealm. It was at one time supposed that the dark colour of the spots\r\nwas due to the fact that the photosphere was broken through in those\r\nspaces, and that we looked down through them upon the surface of the\r\nslightly illuminated central part of the sphere. This view is\r\nuntenable, and in its place we have to assume that for the eight\r\nhundred and sixty thousand miles of its diameter the sun is composed\r\nof matter such as is found in our earth, but throughout in a state of\r\nheat which vastly exceeds that known on or in our planet. Owing to its\r\nheat, this matter is possibly not in either the solid or the fluid\r\nstate, but in that of very compressed gases, which are kept from\r\nbecoming solid or even fluid by the very high temperature which exists\r\nin them. This view is apparently supported by the fact that, while the\r\npressure upon its matter is twenty-seven times greater in the sun than\r\nit is in the earth, the weight of the whole mass is less than we\r\nshould expect under these conditions.\r\n\r\nAs for the temperature of the sun, we only know that it is hot enough\r\nto turn the metals into gases in the manner in which this is done in a\r\nstrong electric arc, but no satisfactory method of reckoning the scale\r\nof this heat has been devised. The probabilities are to the effect\r\nthat the heat is to be counted by the tens of thousands of degrees\r\nFahrenheit, and it may amount to hundreds of thousands; it has,\r\nindeed, been reckoned as high as a million degrees. This vast\r\ndischarge is not due to any kind of burning action--i.e., to the\r\ncombustion of substances, as in a fire. It must be produced by the\r\ngradual falling in of the materials, due to the gravitation of the\r\nmass toward its centre, each particle converting its energy of\r\nposition into heat, as does the meteorite when it comes into the air.\r\n\r\nIt is well to close this very imperfect account of the learning which\r\nrelates to the sun with a brief tabular statement showing the relative\r\nmasses of the several bodies of the solar system. It should be\r\nunderstood that by mass is meant not the bulk of the object, but the\r\nactual amount of matter in it as determined by the gravitative\r\nattraction which it exercises on other celestial bodies. In this test\r\nthe sun is taken as the measure, and its mass is for convenience\r\nreckoned at 1,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n             TABLE OF RELATIVE MASSES OF SUN AND PLANETS.[2]\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |  The sun                                    1,000,000,000  |\r\n    |  Mercury                                              200  |\r\n    |  Venus                                              2,353  |\r\n    |  Earth                                              3,060  |\r\n    |  Mars                                                 339  |\r\n    |  Asteroids                                              ?  |\r\n    |  Saturn                                           285,580  |\r\n    |  Jupiter                                          954,305  |\r\n    |  Uranus                                            44,250  |\r\n    |  Neptune                                           51,600  |\r\n    |    Combined mass of the four inner planets          5,952  |\r\n    |    Combined mass of all the planets             1,341,687  |\r\n    +------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Newcomb's Popular Astronomy, p. 234. Harper Brothers,\r\nNew York.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the mass of all the planets is about one seven\r\nhundredth that of the sun.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to make a close study of celestial geography will do\r\nwell to procure the interesting set of diagrams prepared by the late\r\nJames Freeman Clarke, in which transparencies placed in a convenient\r\nlantern show the grouping of the important stars in each\r\nconstellation. The advantage of this arrangement is that the little\r\nmaps can be consulted at night and in the open air in a very\r\nconvenient manner. After the student has learned the position of a\r\ndozen of the constellations visible in the northern hemisphere, he can\r\nrapidly advance his knowledge in the admirable method invented by Dr.\r\nClarke.\r\n\r\nHaving learned the constellations, the student may well proceed to\r\nfind the several planets, and to trace them in their apparent path\r\nacross the fixed stars. It will be well for him here to gain if he can\r\nthe conception that their apparent movement is compounded of their\r\nmotion around the sun and that of our own sphere; that it would be\r\nvery different if our earth stood still in the heavens. At this stage\r\nhe may well begin to take in mind the evidence which the planetary\r\nmotion supplies that the earth really moves round the sun, and not\r\nthe sun and planets round the earth. This discovery was one of the\r\ngreat feats of the human mind; it baffled the wits of the best men for\r\nthousands of years. Therefore the inquirer who works over the evidence\r\nis treading one of the famous paths by which his race climbed the\r\nsteeps of science.\r\n\r\nThe student must not expect to find the evidence that the sun is the\r\ncentre of the solar system very easy to interpret; and yet any youth\r\nof moderate curiosity, and that interest in the world about him which\r\nis the foundation of scientific insight, can see through the matter.\r\nHe will best begin his inquiries by getting a clear notion of the fact\r\nthat the moon goes round the earth. This is the simplest case of\r\nmovements of this nature which he can see in the solar system. Noting\r\nthat the moon occupies a different place at a given hour in the\r\ntwenty-four, but is evidently at all times at about the same distance\r\nfrom the earth, he readily perceives that it circles about our sphere.\r\nThis the people knew of old, but they made of it an evidence that the\r\nsun also went around our sphere. Here, then, is the critical point.\r\nWhy does the sun not behave in the same manner as the moon? At this\r\nstage of his inquiry the student best notes what takes place in the\r\nmotions of the planets between the earth and the sun. He observes that\r\nthose so-called inferior planets Mercury and Venus are never very far\r\naway from the central body; that they appear to rise up from it, and\r\nthen to go back to it, and that they have phases like the moon. Now\r\nand then Venus may be observed as a black spot crossing the disk of\r\nthe sun. A little consideration will show that on the theory that\r\nbodies revolve round each other in the solar system these movements of\r\nthe inner planets can only be explained on the supposition that they\r\nat least travel around the great central fire. Now, taking up the\r\nouter planets, we observe that they occasionally appear very bright,\r\nand that they are then at a place in the heavens where we see that\r\nthey are far from the solar centre. Gradually they move down toward\r\nthe sunset and disappear from view. Here, too, the movement, though\r\nless clearly so, is best reconcilable with the idea that these bodies\r\ntravel in orbits, such as those which are traversed by the inner\r\nplanets. The wonder is that with these simple facts before them, and\r\nwith ample time to think the matter over, the early astronomers did\r\nnot learn the great truth about the solar system--namely, that the sun\r\nis the centre about which the planets circled. Their difficulty lay\r\nmainly in the fact that they did not conceive the earth as a sphere,\r\nand even after they attained that conception they believed that our\r\nglobe was vastly larger than the planets, or even than the sun. This\r\nmisconception kept even the thoughtful Greeks, who knew that the earth\r\nwas spherical in form, from a clear notion as to the structure of our\r\nsystem. It was not, indeed, until mathematical astronomy attained a\r\nconsiderable advance, and men began to measure the distances in the\r\nsolar system, and until the Newtonian theory of gravitation was\r\ndeveloped, that the planetary orbits and the relation of the various\r\nbodies in the solar system to each other could be perfectly discerned.\r\n\r\nCare has been taken in the above statements to give the student\r\nindices which may assist him in working out for himself the evidence\r\nwhich may properly lead a person, even without mathematical\r\nconsiderations of a formal kind, to construct a theory as to the\r\nrelation of the planets to the sun. It is not likely that he can go\r\nthrough all the steps of this argument at once, but it will be most\r\nuseful to him to ponder upon the problem, and gradually win his way to\r\na full understanding of it. With that purpose in mind, he should avoid\r\nreading what astronomers have to say on the matter until he is\r\nsatisfied that he has done as much as he can with the matter on his\r\nown account. He should, however, state his observations, and as far as\r\npossible draw the results in his note-book in a diagrammatic form. He\r\nshould endeavour to see if the facts are reconcilable with any other\r\nsupposition than that the earth and the other planets move around the\r\nsun. When he has done his task, he will have passed over one of the\r\nmost difficult roads which his predecessors had to traverse on their\r\nway to an understanding of the heavens. Even if he fail he will have\r\nhelped himself to some large understandings.\r\n\r\nThe student will find it useful to make a map of the heavens, or\r\nrather make several representing their condition at different times in\r\nthe year. On this plot he should put down only the stars whose places\r\nand names he has learned, but he should plot the position of the\r\nplanets at different times. In this way, though at first his efforts\r\nwill be very awkward, he will soon come to know the general geography\r\nof the heavens.\r\n\r\nAlthough the possession or at least the use of a small astronomical\r\ntelescope is a great advantage to a student after he has made a\r\ncertain advance in his work, such an instrument is not at all\r\nnecessary, or, indeed, desirable at the outset of his studies. An\r\nordinary opera-glass, however, will help him in picking out the stars\r\nin the constellations, in identifying the planets, and in getting a\r\nbetter idea as to the form of the moon's surface--a matter which will\r\nbe treated in this work in connection with the structure of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                             THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn beginning the study of the earth it is important that the student\r\nshould at once form the habit of keeping in mind the spherical form of\r\nthe planet. Many persons, while they may blindly accept the fact that\r\nthe earth is a sphere, do not think of it as having that form. Perhaps\r\nthe simplest way of securing the correct image of the shape is to\r\nimagine how the earth would appear as seen from the moon. In its full\r\ncondition the moon is apt to appear as a disk. When it is new, and\r\nalso when in its waning stages it is visible in the daytime, the\r\nspherical form is very apparent. Imagining himself on the surface of\r\nthe moon, the student can well perceive how the earth would appear as\r\na vast body in the heavens; its eight thousand miles of diameter,\r\nabout four times that of the satellite, would give an area sixteen\r\ntimes the size which the moon presents to us. On this scale the\r\ncontinents and oceans would appear very much more plain than do the\r\nrelatively slight irregularities on the lunar surface.\r\n\r\nWith the terrestrial globe in hand, the student can readily construct\r\nan image which will represent, at least in outline, the appearance\r\nwhich the sphere he inhabits would present when seen from a distance\r\nof about a quarter of a million miles away. The continent of\r\nEurope-Asia would of itself appear larger than all the lunar surface\r\nwhich is visible to us. Every continent and all the greater islands\r\nwould be clearly indicated. The snow covering which in the winter of\r\nthe northern hemisphere wraps so much of the land would be seen to\r\ncome and go in the changes of the seasons; even the permanent ice\r\nabout either pole, and the greater regions of glaciers, such as those\r\nof the Alps and the Himalayas, would appear as brilliant patches of\r\nwhite amid fields of darker hue. Even the changes in the aspect of the\r\nvegetation which at one season clothes the wide land with a green\r\nmantle, and at another assumes the dun hue of winter, would be, to the\r\nunaided eye, very distinct. It is probable that all the greater rivers\r\nwould be traceable as lines of light across the relatively dark\r\nsurface of the continents. By such exercises of the constructive\r\nimagination--indeed, in no other way--the student can acquire the\r\nhabit of considering the earth as a vast whole. From time to time as\r\nhe studies the earth from near by he should endeavour to assemble the\r\nphenomena in the general way which we have indicated.\r\n\r\nThe reader has doubtless already learned that the earth is a slightly\r\nflattened sphere, having an average diameter of about eight thousand\r\nmiles, the average section at the equator being about twenty-six miles\r\ngreater than that from pole to pole. In a body of such large\r\nproportions this difference in measurement appears not important; it\r\nis, however, most significant, for it throws light upon the history of\r\nthe earth's mass. Computation shows that the measure of flattening at\r\nthe poles is just what would occur if the earth were or had been at\r\nthe time when it assumed its present form in a fluid condition. We\r\nreadily conceive that a soft body revolving in space, while all its\r\nparticles by gravitation tended to the centre, would in turning\r\naround, as our earth does upon its axis, tend to bulge out in those\r\nparts which were remote from the line upon which the turning took\r\nplace. Thus the flattening of our sphere at the poles corroborates the\r\nopinion that its mass was once molten--in a word, that its ancient\r\nhistory was such as the nebular theory suggests.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have for convenience termed the earth a flattened\r\nspheroid, it is only such in a very general sense. It has an infinite\r\nnumber of minor irregularities which it is the province of the\r\ngeographer to trace and that of the geologist to account for. In the\r\nfirst place, its surface is occupied by a great array of ridges and\r\nhollows. The larger of these, the oceans and continents, first deserve\r\nour attention. The difference in altitude of the earth's surface from\r\nthe height of the continents to the deepest part of the sea is\r\nprobably between ten and eleven miles, thus amounting to about two\r\nfifths of the polar flattening before noted. The average difference\r\nbetween the ocean floor and the summits of the neighbouring continents\r\nis probably rather less than four miles. It happens, most fortunately\r\nfor the history of the earth, that the water upon its surface fills\r\nits great concavities on the average to about four fifths of their\r\ntotal depth, leaving only about one fifth of the relief projecting\r\nabove the ocean level. We have termed this arrangement fortunate, for\r\nit insures that rainfall visits almost all the land areas, and thereby\r\nmakes those realms fit for the uses of life. If the ocean had only\r\nhalf its existing area, the lands would be so wide that only their\r\nfringes would be fertile. If it were one fifth greater than it is, the\r\ndry areas would be reduced to a few scattered islands.\r\n\r\nFrom all points of view the most important feature of the earth's\r\nsurface arises from its division into land and water areas, and this\r\nfor the reason that the physical and vital work of our sphere is\r\ninevitably determined by this distribution. The shape of the seas and\r\nlands is fixed by the positions at which the upper level of the great\r\nwater comes against the ridges which fret the earth's surface. These\r\nelevations are so disposed that about two thirds of the hard mass is\r\nat the present time covered with water, and only one third exposed to\r\nthe atmosphere. This proportion is inconstant. Owing to the endless\r\nup-and-down goings of the earth's surface, the place of the shore\r\nlines varies from year to year, and in the geological ages great\r\nrevolutions in the forms and relative area of water and land are\r\nbrought about.\r\n\r\nNoting the greater divisions of land and water as they are shown on a\r\nglobe, we readily perceive that those parts of the continental ridges\r\nwhich rise above the sea level are mainly accumulated in the northern\r\nhemisphere--in fact, far more than half the dry realm is in that part\r\nof the world. We furthermore perceive that all the continents more or\r\nless distinctly point to the southward; they are, in a word,\r\ntriangles, with their bases to the northward, and their apices,\r\nusually rather acute, directed to the southward. This form is very\r\nwell indicated in three of the great lands, North and South America\r\nand Africa; it is more indistinctly shown in Asia and in Australia. As\r\nyet we do not clearly understand the reason why the continents are\r\ntriangular, why they point toward the south pole, or why they are\r\nmainly accumulated in the northern hemisphere. As stated in the\r\nchapter on astronomy, some trace of the triangular form appears in the\r\nland masses of the planet Mars. There, too, these triangles appear to\r\npoint toward one pole.\r\n\r\nBesides the greater lands, the seas are fretted by a host of smaller\r\ndry areas, termed islands. These, as inquiry has shown, are of two\r\nvery diverse natures. Near the continents, practically never more than\r\na thousand miles from their shores, we find isles, often of great\r\nsize, such as Madagascar, which in their structure are essentially\r\nlike the continents--that is, they are built in part or in whole of\r\nnon-volcanic rocks, sandstones, limestones, etc. In most cases these\r\nislands, to which we may apply the term continental, have at some time\r\nbeen connected with the neighbouring mainland, and afterward separated\r\nfrom it by a depression of the surface which permitted the sea to flow\r\nover the lowlands. Geologists have traced many cases where in the past\r\nelevations which are now parts of a continent were once islands next\r\nits shore. In the deeper seas far removed from the margins of the\r\ncontinents the islands are made up of volcanic ejections of lava,\r\npumice, and dust, which has been thrown up from craters and fallen\r\naround their margin or are formed of coral and other organic remains.\r\n\r\nNext after this general statement as to the division of sea and land\r\nwe should note the peculiarities which the earth's surface exhibits\r\nwhere it is bathed by the air, and where it is covered by the water.\r\nBeginning with the best-known region, that of the dry land, we observe\r\nthat the surface is normally made up of continuous slopes of varying\r\ndeclivity, which lead down from the high points to the sea. Here and\r\nthere, though rarely, these slopes centre in a basin which is occupied\r\nby a lake or a dead sea. On the deeper ocean floors, so far as we may\r\njudge with the defective information which the plumb line gives us,\r\nthere is no such continuity in the downward sloping of the surface,\r\nthe area being cast into numerous basins, each of great extent.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine in some detail the shape of the land surface, we\r\nreadily perceive that the continuous down slopes are due to the\r\ncutting action of rivers. In the basin of a stream the waters act to\r\nwear away the original heights, filling them into the hollows, until\r\nthe whole area has a continuous down grade to the point where the\r\nwaters discharge into the ocean or perhaps into a lake. On the bottom\r\nof the sea, except near the margin of the continent, where the floor\r\nmay in recent geological times have been elevated into the air, and\r\nthus exposed to river action, there is no such agent working to\r\nproduce continuous down grades.\r\n\r\nLooking upon a map of a continent which shows the differences in\r\naltitude of the land, we readily perceive that the area is rather\r\nclearly divided into two kinds of surface, mountains and plains, each\r\nkind being sharply distinguished from the other by many important\r\npeculiarities. Mountains are characteristically made up of distinct,\r\nmore or less parallel ridges and valleys, which are grouped in very\r\nelongated belts, which, in the case of the American Cordilleras,\r\nextend from the Arctic to the Antarctic Circle. Only in rare instances\r\ndo we find mountains occupying an area which is not very distinctly\r\nelongated, and in such cases the elevations are usually of no great\r\nheight. Plains, on the other hand, commonly occupy the larger part of\r\nthe continent, and are distributed around the flanks of the mountain\r\nsystems. There is no rule as to their shape; they normally grade away\r\nfrom the bases of the mountains toward the sea, and are often\r\nprolonged below the level of the water for a considerable distance\r\nbeyond the shore, forming what is commonly known as the continental\r\nshelf or belt of shallows along the coast line. We will now consider\r\nsome details concerning the form and structure of mountains.\r\n\r\nIn almost any mountain region a glance over the surface of the country\r\nwill give the reader a clew to the principal factor which has\r\ndetermined the existence of these elevations. Wherever the bed rocks\r\nare revealed he will recognise the fact that they have been much\r\ndisturbed. Almost everywhere the strata are turned at high angles;\r\noften their slopes are steeper than those of house roofs, and not\r\ninfrequently they stand in attitudes where they appear vertical. Under\r\nthe surface of plains bedded rocks generally retain the nearly\r\nhorizontal position in which all such deposits are most likely to be\r\nfound. If the observer will attentively study the details of position\r\nof these tilted rocks of mountainous districts, he will in most cases\r\nbe able to perceive that the beds have been flexed or folded in the\r\nmanner indicated by the diagram. Sometimes, though rarely, the tops of\r\nthese foldings or arches have been preserved, so that the nature of\r\nthe movement can be clearly discerned. More commonly the upper parts\r\nof the upward-arching strata have been cut off by the action of the\r\ndecay-bringing forces--frost, flowing water, or creeping ice in\r\nglaciers--so that only the downward pointing folds which were formed\r\nin the mountain-making are well preserved, and these are almost\r\ninvariably hidden within the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Section of mountains.

The numbers indicate the several\r\nformations.]\r\n\r\nBy walking across any considerable mountain chain, as, for instance,\r\nthat of the Alleghanies, it is generally possible to trace a number of\r\nthese parallel up-and-down folds of the strata, so that we readily\r\nperceive that the original beds had been packed together into a much\r\nless space than they at first occupied. In some cases we could prove\r\nthat the shortening of the line has amounted to a hundred miles or\r\nmore--in other words, points on the plain lands on either side of the\r\nmountain range which now exists may have been brought a hundred miles\r\nor so nearer together than they were before the elevations were\r\nproduced. The reader can make for himself a convenient diagram showing\r\nwhat occurred by pressing a number of leaves of this book so that the\r\nsheets of paper are thrown into ridges and furrows. By this experiment\r\nhe also will see that the easiest way to account for such foldings as\r\nwe observe in mountains is by the supposition that some force residing\r\nin the earth tends to shove the beds into a smaller space than they\r\noriginally occupied. Not only are the rocks composing the mountains\r\nmuch folded, but they are often broken through after the manner of\r\nmasonry which has been subjected to earthquake shocks, or of ice which\r\nhas been strained by the expansion that affects it as it becomes\r\nwarmed before it is melted. In fact, many of our small lakes in New\r\nEngland and in other countries of a long winter show in a miniature\r\nway during times of thawing ice folds which much resemble mountain\r\narches.\r\n\r\nAt first geologists were disposed to attribute all the phenomena of\r\nmountain-folding to the progressive cooling of the earth. Although\r\nthis sphere has already lost a large part of the heat with which it\r\nwas in the beginning endowed, it is still very hot in its deeper\r\nparts, as is shown by the phenomena of volcanoes. This internal heat,\r\nwhich to the present day at the depth of a hundred miles below the\r\nsurface is probably greater than that of molten iron, is constantly\r\nflowing away into space; probably enough of it goes away on the\r\naverage each day to melt a hundred cubic miles or more of ice, or, in\r\nmore scientific phrase, the amount of heat rendered latent by melting\r\nthat volume of frozen water. J.R. Meyer, an eminent physicist,\r\nestimated the quantity of heat so escaping each day of the year to be\r\nsufficient to melt two hundred and forty cubic miles of ice. The\r\neffect of this loss of heat is constantly to shrink the volume of the\r\nearth; it has, indeed, been estimated that the sphere on this account\r\ncontracts on the average to the amount of some inches each thousand\r\nyears. For the reason that almost all this heat goes from the depths\r\nof the earth, the cool outer portion losing no considerable part of\r\nit, the contraction that is brought about affects the interior\r\nportions of the sphere alone. The inner mass constantly shrinking as\r\nit loses heat, the outer, cold part is by its weight forced to settle\r\ndown, and can only accomplish this result by wrinkling. An analogous\r\naction may be seen where an apple or a potato becomes dried; in this\r\ncase the hard outer rind is forced to wrinkle, because, losing no\r\nwater, it does not diminish in its extent, and can only accommodate\r\nitself to the interior by a wrinkling process. In one case it is water\r\nwhich escapes, in the other heat; but in both contraction of the part\r\nwhich suffers the loss leads to the folding of the outside of the\r\nspheroid.\r\n\r\nAlthough this loss of heat on the part of the earth accounts in some\r\nmeasure for the development of mountains, it is not of itself\r\nsufficient to explain the phenomena, and this for the reason that\r\nmountains appear in no case to develop on the floors of the wide sea.\r\nThe average depth of the ocean is only fifteen thousand feet, while\r\nthere are hundreds, if not thousands, of mountain crests which exceed\r\nthat height above the sea. Therefore if mountains grew on the sea\r\nfloor as they do upon the land, there should be thousands of peaks\r\nrising above the plain of the waters, while, in fact, all of the\r\nislands except those near the shores of continents are of volcanic\r\norigin--that is, are lands of totally different nature.\r\n\r\nWhenever a considerable mountain chain is formed, although the actual\r\nfolding of the beds is limited to the usually narrow field occupied by\r\nthese disturbances, the elevation takes place over a wide belt of\r\ncountry on one or both sides of the range. Thus if we approach the\r\nRocky Mountains from the Mississippi Valley, we begin to mount up an\r\ninclined plane from the time we pass westward from the Mississippi\r\nRiver. The beds of rock as well as the surface rises gradually until\r\nat the foot of the mountain; though the rocks are still without\r\nfoldings, they are at a height of four or five thousand feet above the\r\nsea. It seems probable--indeed, we may say almost certain--that when\r\nthe crust is broken, as it is in mountain-building, by extensive folds\r\nand faults, the matter which lies a few score miles below the crust\r\ncreeps in toward those fractures, and so lifts up the country on which\r\nthey lie. When we examine the forms of any of our continents, we find\r\nthat these elevated portions of the earth's crust appear to be made up\r\nof mountains and the table-lands which fringe those elevations. There\r\nis not, as some of our writers suppose, two different kinds of\r\nelevation in our great lands--the continents and the mountains which\r\nthey bear--but one process of elevation by which the foldings and the\r\nmassive uplifts which constitute the table-lands are simultaneously\r\nand by one process formed.\r\n\r\nLooking upon continents as the result of mountain growth, we may say\r\nthat here and there on the earth's crust these dislocations have\r\noccurred in such association and of such magnitude that great areas\r\nhave been uplifted above the plain of the sea. In general, we find\r\nthese groups of elevations so arranged that they produce the\r\ntriangular form which is characteristic of the great lands. It will be\r\nobserved, for instance, that the form of North America is in general\r\ndetermined by the position of the Appalachian and Cordilleran systems\r\non its eastern and western margins, though there are a number of\r\nsmaller chains, such as the Laurentians in Canada and the ice-covered\r\nmountains of Greenland, which have a measure of influence in fixing\r\nits shore lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Waterfall near Gadsden, Alabama. The upper shelf of\r\nrock is a hard sandstone, the lower beds are soft shale. The\r\nconditions are those of most waterfalls, such as Niagara._]\r\n\r\nThe history of plains, as well as that of mountains, will have further\r\nlight thrown upon it when in the next chapter we come to consider the\r\neffect of rain water on the land. We may here note the fact that the\r\nlevel surfaces which are above the seashores are divisible into two\r\nmain groups--those which have been recently lifted above the sea\r\nlevel, composed of materials laid down in the shallows next the shore,\r\nand which have not yet shared in mountain-building disturbances, and\r\nthose which have been slightly tilted in the manner before indicated\r\nin the case of the plains which border the Rocky Mountains on the\r\neast. The great southern plain of eastern and southern United States,\r\nextending from near New York to Mexico, is a good specimen of the\r\nlevel lands common on all the continents which have recently emerged\r\nfrom the sea. The table-lands on either side of the Mississippi\r\nValley, sloping from the Alleghanies and the Cordilleras, represent\r\nthe more ancient type of plain which has already shared in the\r\nelevation which mountain-building brings about. In rarer cases plains\r\nof small area are formed where mountains formerly existed by the\r\ncomplete moving down of the original ridges.\r\n\r\nThere is a common opinion that the continents are liable in the course\r\nof the geologic ages to very great changes of position; that what is\r\nnow sea may give place to new great lands, and that those already\r\nexisting may utterly disappear. This opinion was indeed generally held\r\nby geologists not more than thirty years ago. Further study of the\r\nproblem has shown us that while parts of each continent may at any\r\ntime be depressed beneath the sea, the whole of its surface rarely if\r\never goes below the water level. Thus, in the case of North America,\r\nwe can readily note very great changes in its form since the land\r\nbegan to rise above the water. But always, from that ancient day to\r\nour own, some portion of the area has been above the level of the sea,\r\nthus providing an ark of refuge for the land life when it was\r\ndisturbed by inundations. The strongest evidence in favour of the\r\nopinion that the existing continents have endured for many million\r\nyears is found in the fact that each of the great lands preserves many\r\ndistinct groups of animals and plants which have descended from\r\nancient forms dwelling upon the same territory. If at any time the\r\nrelatively small continent of Australia had gone beneath the sea, all\r\nof the curious pouched animals akin to the opossum and kangaroo which\r\nabound in that country--creatures belonging in the ancient life of the\r\nworld--would have been overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that the uplifting of mountains and of\r\nthe table-lands about them, which appears to have been the basis of\r\ncontinental growth, has been due to strains in the rocks sufficiently\r\nstrong to disturb the beds. At each stage of the mountain-building\r\nmovement these compressive strains have had to contend with the very\r\ngreat weight of the rocks which they had to move. These lands are not\r\nto be regarded as firm set or rigid arches, but as highly elastic\r\nstructures, the shapes of which may be determined by any actions which\r\nput on or take off burden. We see a proof of this fact from numerous\r\nobservations which geologists are now engaged in making. Thus during\r\nthe last ice epoch, when almost all the northern part of this\r\ncontinent, as well as the northern part of Europe, was covered by an\r\nice sheet several thousand feet thick, the lands sank down under their\r\nload, and to an extent roughly proportional to the depth of the icy\r\ncovering. While the northern regions were thus tilted down by the\r\nweight which was upon them, the southern section of this land, the\r\nregion about the Gulf of Mexico, was elevated much above its present\r\nlevel; it seems likely, indeed, that the peninsula of Florida rose to\r\nthe height of several hundred feet above its present shore line. After\r\nthe ice passed away the movements were reversed, the northern region\r\nrising and the southern sinking down. These movements are attested by\r\nthe position of the old shore lines formed during the later stages of\r\nthe Glacial epoch. Thus around Lake Ontario, as well as the other\r\nGreat Lakes, the beaches which mark the higher positions of those\r\ninland seas during the closing stages of the ice time, and which, of\r\ncourse, were when formed horizontal, now rise to the northward at the\r\nrate of from two to five feet for each mile of distance. Recent\r\nstudies by Mr. G.K. Gilbert show that this movement is still in\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nOther evidence going to show the extent to which the movements of the\r\nearth's crust are affected by the weight of materials are found in the\r\nfact that wherever along the shores thick deposits of sediments are\r\naccumulated the tendency of the region where they lie is gradually to\r\nsink downward, so that strata having an aggregate thickness of ten\r\nthousand feet or more may be accumulated in a sea which was always\r\nshallow. The ocean floor, in general, is the part of the earth's\r\nsurface where strata are constantly being laid down. In the great\r\nreservoir of the waters the _débris_ washed from the land, the dust\r\nfrom volcanoes, and that from the stellar spaces, along with the vast\r\naccumulation of organic remains, almost everywhere lead to the\r\nsteadfast accumulation of sedimentary deposits. On the other hand, the\r\nrealms of the surface above the ocean level are constantly being worn\r\naway by the action of the rivers and glaciers, of the waves which beat\r\nagainst the shores, and of the winds which blow over desert regions.\r\nThe result is that the lands are wearing down at the geologically\r\nrapid average rate of somewhere about one foot in five thousand years.\r\nAll this heavy matter goes to the sea bottoms. Probably to this cause\r\nwe owe in part the fact that in the wrinklings of the crust due to the\r\ncontraction of the interior the lands exhibit a prevailing tendency to\r\nuprise, while the ocean floors sink down. In this way the continents\r\nare maintained above the level of the sea despite the powerful forces\r\nwhich are constantly wearing their substance away, while the seas\r\nremain deep, although they are continually being burdened with\r\nimported materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Diagram showing the effect of the position of\r\nthe fulcrum point in the movement of the land masses. In diagrams I\r\nand II, the lines _a b_ represent the land before the movement, and\r\n_a' b'_ its position after the movement; _s_, _s_, the position of the\r\nshore line; _p_, _p_, the pivotal points; _l_, _s_, the sea line. In\r\ndiagram III, the curved line designates a shore; the line _a b_,\r\nconnecting the pivotal points _p_, _p_, is partly under the land and\r\npartly under the sea.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that if the sea floors tend to sink downward, while\r\nthe continental lands uprise, the movements which take place may be\r\ncompared with those which occur in a lever about a fulcrum point. In\r\nthis case the sea end of the bar is descending and the land end\r\nascending. Now, it is evident that the fulcrum point may fall to the\r\nseaward or to the landward of the shore; only by chance and here and\r\nthere would it lie exactly at the coast line. By reference to the\r\ndiagram (Fig. 8), it will be seen that, while the point of rotation is\r\njust at the shore, a considerable movement may take place without\r\naltering the position of the coast line. Where the point of no\r\nmovement is inland of the coast, the sea will gain on the continent;\r\nwhere, however, the point is to seaward, beneath the water, the land\r\nwill gain on the ocean. In this way we can, in part at least, account\r\nfor the endless changes in the attitude of the land along the coastal\r\nbelt without having to suppose that the continents cease to rise or\r\nthe sea floors to sink downward. It is evident that the bar or section\r\nof the rocks from the interior of the land to the bottoms of the seas\r\nis not rigid; it is also probable that the matter in the depths of the\r\nearth, which moves with the motions of this bar, would change the\r\nposition of the fulcrum point from time to time. Thus it may well come\r\nabout that our coast lines are swaying up and down in ceaseless\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nIn very recent geological times, probably since the beginning of the\r\nlast Glacial period, the region about the Dismal Swamp in Virginia has\r\nswayed up and down through four alternating movements to the extent of\r\nfrom fifty to one hundred feet. The coast of New Jersey is now sinking\r\nat the rate of about two feet in a hundred years. The coast of New\r\nEngland, though recently elevated to the extent of a hundred feet or\r\nmore, at a yet later time sank down, so that at some score of points\r\nbetween New York and Eastport, Me., we find the remains of forests\r\nwith the roots of their trees still standing below high-tide mark in\r\npositions where the trees could not have grown. Along all the marine\r\ncoasts of the world which have been carefully studied from this point\r\nof view there are similar evidences of slight or great modern changes\r\nin the level of the lands. At some points, particularly on the coast\r\nof Alaska and along the coast of Peru, these uplifts of the land have\r\namounted to a thousand feet or more. In the peninsular district of\r\nScandinavia the swayings, sometimes up and sometimes down, which are\r\nnow going on have considerably changed the position of the shore lines\r\nsince the beginning of the historical period.\r\n\r\nThere are other causes which serve to modify the shapes and sizes of\r\nthe continents which may best be considered in the sequel; for the\r\npresent we may pass from this subject with the statement that our\r\ngreat lands are relatively permanent features; their forms change from\r\nage to age, but they have remained for millions of years habitable to\r\nthe hosts of animals and plants which have adapted their life to the\r\nconditions which these fields afford them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                            THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm-set portion of the earth, composed of materials which became\r\nsolid when the heat so far disappeared from the sphere that rocky\r\nmatter could pass from its previous fluid condition to the solid or\r\nfrozen state, is wrapped about by two great envelopes, the atmosphere\r\nand the waters. Of these we shall first consider the lighter and more\r\nuniversal air; in taking account of its peculiarities we shall have to\r\nmake some mention of the water with which it is greatly involved;\r\nafterward we shall consider the structure and functions of that fluid.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric envelopes appear to be common features about the celestial\r\nspheres. In the sun there is, as we have noted, a very deep envelope\r\nof this sort which is in part composed of the elements which form our\r\nown air; but, owing to the high temperature of the sphere, these are\r\ncommingled with many substances which in our earth--at least in its\r\nouter parts--have entered in the solid state. Some of the planets, so\r\nfar as we can discern their conditions, seem also to have gaseous\r\nwraps; this is certainly the case with the planet Mars, and even the\r\nlittle we know of the other like spheres justifies the supposition\r\nthat Jupiter and Saturn, at least, have a like constitution. We may\r\nregard an atmosphere, in a word, as representing a normal and\r\nlong-continued state in the development of the heavenly orbs. In only\r\none of these considerable bodies of the solar system, the moon, do we\r\nfind tolerably clear evidence that there is no atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the earth is composed mainly of very volatile\r\nelements, known as nitrogen and argon. This is commingled with oxygen,\r\nalso a volatile element. Into this mass a number of other substances\r\nenter in varying but always relatively very small proportions. Of\r\nthese the most considerable are watery vapour and carbon dioxide; the\r\nformer of these rarely amounts to one per cent of the weight of the\r\nair, considering the atmosphere as a whole, and the latter is never\r\nmore than a small fraction of one per cent in amount. As a whole, the\r\nair envelope of the earth should be regarded as a mass of nitrogen and\r\nargon, which only rarely, under the influence of conditions which\r\nexist in the soil, enters into combinations with other elements by\r\nwhich it assumes a solid form. The oxygen, though a permanent element\r\nin the atmosphere, tends constantly to enter into combinations which\r\nfix it temporarily or permanently in the earth, in which it forms,\r\nindeed, in its combined state about one half the weight of all the\r\nmineral substances we know. The carbon dioxide, or carbonic-acid gas,\r\nas it is commonly termed, is a most important substance, as it affords\r\nplants all that part of their bodies which disappear on burning. It is\r\nconstantly returned to the atmosphere by the decay of organic matter,\r\nas well as by volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-noted materials composing the air, all of\r\nwhich are imperatively necessary to the wonderful work accomplished by\r\nthat envelope, we find a host of other substances which are\r\naccidentally, variably, and always in small quantities contained in\r\nthis realm. Thus near the seashores, and indeed for a considerable\r\ndistance into the continent, we find the air contains a certain amount\r\nof salt so finely divided that it floats in the atmosphere. So, too,\r\nwe find the air, even on the mountain tops amid eternal snows, charged\r\nwith small particles of dust, which, though not evident to the\r\nunassisted eye, become at once visible when we permit a slender ray of\r\nlight to enter a dark chamber.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly asserted that the atmosphere does not effectively\r\nextend above the height of forty-five miles; we know that it is\r\ndensest on the surface of the earth, the most so in those depressions\r\nwhich lie below the level of the sea. This is proved to us by the\r\nweight which the air imposes upon the mercury at the open end of a\r\nbarometric tube. If we could deepen these cavities to the extent of a\r\nthousand miles, the pressure would become so great that if the pit\r\nwere kept free from the heat of the earth the gaseous materials would\r\nbecome liquefied. Upward from the earth's surface at the sea level the\r\natoms and molecules of the air become farther apart until, at the\r\nheight of somewhere between forty and fifty miles, the quantity of\r\nthem contained in the ether is so small that we can trace little\r\neffect from them on the rays of light which at lower levels are\r\nsomewhat bent by their action. At yet higher levels, however, meteors\r\nappear to inflame by friction against the particles of air, and even\r\nat the height of eighty miles very faint clouds have at times been\r\ndiscerned, which are possibly composed of volcanic dust floating in\r\nthe very rarefied medium, such as must exist at this great elevation.\r\n\r\nThe air not only exists in the region where we distinctly recognise\r\nit; it also occupies the waters and the under earth. In the waters it\r\noccurs as a mechanical mixture which is brought about as the rain\r\nforms and falls in the air, as the streams flow to the sea, and as the\r\nwaves roll over the deep and beat against the shores. In the realm of\r\nthe waters, as well as on the land, the air is necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of all animal forms; but for its presence such life would\r\nvanish from the earth.\r\n\r\nOwing to certain peculiarities in its constitution, the atmosphere of\r\nour earth, and that doubtless of myriad other spheres, serves as a\r\nmedium of communication between different regions. It is, as we know,\r\nin ceaseless motion at rates which may vary from the speed in the\r\ngreatest tempests, which may move at the rate of somewhere a hundred\r\nand fifty miles an hour, to the very slow movements which occur in\r\ncaverns, where the transfer is sometimes effected at an almost\r\nmicroscopic rate in the space of a day. The motion of the atmosphere\r\nis brought about by the action of heat here and there, and in a\r\ntrifling way, by the heat from the interior of the earth escaping\r\nthrough hot springs or volcanoes, but almost altogether by the heat of\r\nthe sun. If we can imagine the earth cut off from the solar radiation,\r\nthe air would cease to move. We often note how the variable winds fall\r\naway in the nighttime. Those who in seeking for the North Pole have\r\nspent winters in the long-continued dark of that region have noted\r\nthat the winds almost cease to blow, the air being disturbed only when\r\na storm originated in the sunlit realm forced its way into the\r\ncircumpolar darkness.\r\n\r\nThe sun's heat does not directly disturb the atmosphere; if we could\r\ntake the solid sphere of the world away, leaving the air, the rays\r\nwould go straight through, and there would be no winds produced. This\r\nis due to the fact that the air permits the direct rays of heat, such\r\nas come from the sun, to pass through it with very slight resistance.\r\nIn an aërial globe such as we have imagined, the rays impinging upon\r\nits surface would be slightly thrown out of their path as they are in\r\npassing through a lens, but they would journey on in space without in\r\nany considerable measure warming the mass. Coming, however, upon the\r\nsolid earth, the heat rays warm the materials on which they are\r\narrested, bringing them to a higher temperature than the air. Then\r\nthese heated materials radiate the energy into the air; it happens,\r\nhowever, that this radiant heat can not journey back into space as\r\neasily as it came in; therefore the particles of air next the surface\r\nacquire a relatively high temperature. Thus a thermometer next the\r\nground may rise to over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit, while at the\r\nsame time the fleecy clouds which we may observe floating at the\r\nheight of five or six miles above the surface are composed of frozen\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the heated air which acquires its temperature by\r\nradiation from the earth's surface is to produce the winds. This it\r\nbrings about in a very simple manner, though the details of the\r\nprocess have a certain complication. The best illustration of the mode\r\nin which the winds are produced is obtained by watching what takes\r\nplace about an ordinary fire at the bottom of a chimney. As soon as\r\nthe fire is lit, we observe that the air about it, so far as it is\r\nheated, tends upward, drawing the smoke with it. If the air in the\r\nchimney be cold, it may not draw well at first; but in a few minutes\r\nthe draught is established, or, in other words, the heated lower air\r\nbreaks its way up the shaft, gradually pushing the cooler matter out\r\nat the top. In still air we may observe the column from the flue\r\nextending about the chimney-top, sometimes to the height of a hundred\r\nfeet or more before it is broken to pieces. It is well here to note\r\nthe fact that the energy of the draught in a chimney is, with a given\r\nheat of fire and amount of air which is permitted to enter the shaft,\r\ndirectly proportionate to the height; thus in very tall flues, between\r\ntwo and three hundred feet high, which are sometimes constructed, the\r\nuprush is at the speed of a gale.\r\n\r\nWhenever the air next the surface is so far heated that it may\r\novercome the inertia of the cooler air above, it forces its way up\r\nthrough it in the general manner indicated in the chimney flue. When\r\nsuch a place of uprush is established, the hot air next the surface\r\nflows in all directions toward the shaft, joining the expedition to\r\nthe heights of the atmosphere. Owing to the conditions of the earth's\r\nsurface, which we shall now proceed to trace, these ascents of heated\r\nair belong in two distinct classes--those which move upward through\r\nmore or less cylindrical chimneys in the atmosphere, shafts which are\r\nimpermanent, which vary in diameter from a few feet to fifty or\r\nperhaps a hundred miles, and which move over the surface of the earth;\r\nand another which consists of a broad, beltlike shaft in the\r\nequatorial regions, which in a way girdles the earth, remains in\r\nabout the same place, continually endures, and has a width of hundreds\r\nof miles. Of these two classes of uprushes we shall first consider the\r\ngreatest, which occurs in the central portions of the tropical realm.\r\n\r\nUnder the equator, owing to the fact that the sun for a considerable\r\nbelt of land and sea maintains the earth at a high temperature, there\r\nis a general updraught which began many million years ago, probably\r\nbefore the origin of life, in the age when our atmosphere assumed its\r\npresent conditions. Into this region the cooler air from the north and\r\nsouth necessarily flows, in part pressed in by the weight of the cold\r\nair which overlies it, but aided in its motion by the fact that the\r\nparticles which ascend leave place for others to occupy. Over the\r\nsurfaces of the land within the tropical region this draught toward\r\nwhat we may term the equatorial chimney is perturbed by the\r\nirregularities of the surface and many local accidents. But on the\r\nsea, where the conditions are uniform, the air moving toward the point\r\nof ascent is marked in the trade winds, which blow with a steadfast\r\nsweep down toward the equator. Many slight actions, such as the\r\nmovement of the hot and cold currents of the sea, the local air\r\nmovements from the lands or from detached islands, somewhat perturb\r\nthe trade winds, but they remain among the most permanent features in\r\nthis changeable world. It is doubtful if anything on this sphere\r\nexcept the atoms and molecules of matter have varied as little as the\r\ntrade winds in the centre of the wide ocean. So steadfast and uniform\r\nare they that it is said that the helm and sails of a ship may be set\r\nnear the west coast of South America and be left unchanged for a\r\nvoyage which will carry the navigator in their belt across the width\r\nof the Pacific.\r\n\r\nRising up from the earth in the tropical belt, the air attains the\r\nheight of several thousand feet; it then begins to curve off toward\r\nthe north and south, and at the height of somewhere about three to\r\nfive miles above the surface is again moving horizontally toward\r\neither pole; attaining a distance on that journey, it gradually\r\nsettles down to the surface of the earth, and ceases to move toward\r\nhigher latitudes. If the earth did not revolve upon its axis the\r\ncourse of these winds along the surface toward the equator, and in the\r\nupper air back toward the poles, would be made in what we may call a\r\nsquare manner--that is, the particles of air would move toward the\r\npoint where they begin to rise upward in due north and south lines,\r\naccording as they came from the southern or northern hemisphere, and\r\nthe upper currents or counter trades would retrace their paths also\r\nparallel with the meridians or longitude lines. But because the earth\r\nrevolves from west to east, the course of the trade winds is oblique\r\nto the equator, those in the northern hemisphere blowing from\r\nnortheast to southwest, those in the southern from southeast to\r\nnorthwest. The way in which the motion of the earth affects the\r\ndirection of these currents is not difficult to understand. It is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nLet us conceive a particle of air situated immediately over the\r\nearth's polar axis. Such an atom would by the rotation of the sphere\r\naccomplish no motion except, indeed, that it might turn round on its\r\nown centre. It would acquire no velocity whatever by virtue of the\r\nearth's movement. Then let us imagine the particle moving toward the\r\nequator with the speed of an ordinary wind. At every step of its\r\njourney toward lower latitudes it would come into regions having a\r\ngreater movement than those which it had just left. Owing to its\r\ninertia, it would thus tend continually to lag behind the particles of\r\nmatter about it. It would thus fall off to the westward, and, in place\r\nof moving due south, would in the northern hemisphere drift to the\r\nsouthwest, and in the southern hemisphere toward the northwest. A good\r\nillustration of this action may be obtained from an ordinary\r\nturn-table such as is used about railway stations to reverse the\r\nposition of a locomotive. If the observer will stand in the centre of\r\nsuch a table while it is being turned round he will perceive that his\r\nbody is not swayed to the right or left. If he will then try to walk\r\ntoward the periphery of the rotating disk, he will readily note that\r\nit is very difficult, if not impossible, to walk along the radius of\r\nthe circle; he naturally falls behind in the movement, so that his\r\npath is a curved line exactly such as is followed by the winds which\r\nmove toward the equator in the trades. If now he rests a moment on the\r\nperiphery of the table, so that his body acquires the velocity of the\r\ndisk at that point, and then endeavours to walk toward the centre, he\r\nwill find that again he can not go directly; his path deviates in the\r\nopposite direction--in other words, the body continually going to a\r\nplace having a less rate of movement by virtue of the rotation of the\r\nearth, on account of its momentum is ever moving faster than the\r\nsurface over which it passes. This experiment can readily be tried on\r\nany small rotating disk, such as a potter's wheel, or by rolling a\r\nmarble or a shot from the centre to the circumference and from the\r\ncircumference to the centre. A little reflection will show the\r\ninquirer how these illustrations clearly account for the oblique\r\nthough opposite sets of the trade winds in the upper and lower parts\r\nof the air.\r\n\r\nThe dominating effect of the tropical heat in controlling the\r\nmovements of the air currents extends, on the ocean surface, in\r\ngeneral about as far north and south as the parallels of forty\r\ndegrees, considerably exceeding the limits of the tropics, those lines\r\nwhere the sun, because of the inclination of the earth's axis, at some\r\ntime of the year comes just overhead. Between these belts of trade\r\nwinds there is a strip or belt under the region where the atmosphere\r\nis rising from the earth, in which the winds are irregular and have\r\nlittle energy. This region of the \"doldrums\" or frequent calms is one\r\nof much trouble to sailing ships on their voyages from one hemisphere\r\nto another. In passing through it their sails are filled only by the\r\nairs of local storms, or winds which make their way into that part of\r\nthe sea from the neighbouring continents. Beyond the trade-wind belt,\r\ntoward the poles, the movements of the atmosphere are dependent in\r\npart on the counter trades which descend to the surface of the earth\r\nin latitudes higher than that in which the surface or trade winds\r\nflow. Thus along our Atlantic coast, and even in the body of the\r\ncontinent, at times when the air is not controlled by some local\r\nstorm, the counter trade blows with considerable regularity.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the trade and counter-trade movements of the air on the\r\ndistribution of temperature over the earth's surface is momentous. In\r\npart their influence is due to the direct heat-carrying power of the\r\natmosphere; in larger measure it is brought about by the movement of\r\nthe ocean waters which they induce. Atmospheric air, when deprived of\r\nthe water which it ordinarily contains, has very little\r\nheat-containing capacity. Practically nearly all the power of\r\nconveying heat which it possesses is due to the vapour of water which\r\nit contains. By virtue of this moisture the winds do a good deal to\r\ntransfer heat from the tropical or superheated portion of the earth's\r\nsurface to the circumpolar or underheated realms. At first, the\r\nrelatively cool air which journeys toward the equator along the\r\nsurface of the sea constantly gains in heat, and in that process takes\r\nup more and more water, for precisely the same reason that causes\r\nanything to dry more rapidly in air which has been warmed next a fire.\r\nThe result is that before it begins to ascend in the tropical\r\nupdraught, being much moisture-laden, the atmosphere stores a good\r\ndeal of heat. As it rises, rarefies, and cools, the moisture descends\r\nin the torrential rains which ordinarily fall when the sun is nearly\r\nvertical in the tropical belt.\r\n\r\nHere comes in a very interesting principle which is of importance in\r\nunderstanding the nature of great storms, either the continuous storm\r\nof the tropics or the local and irregular whirlings which occur in\r\nvarious parts of the earth. When the moisture-laden air starts on its\r\nupward journey from the earth it has, by virtue of the watery vapour\r\nwhich it contains, a store of energy which becomes applied to\r\npromoting the updraught. As it rises, the moisture in the air gathers\r\ntogether or condenses, and in so doing parts with the heat which\r\ncaused it to evaporate from the ocean surface. For a given weight of\r\nwater, the amount of heat required to effect the evaporation is very\r\ngreat; this we may roughly judge by observing what a continuous fire\r\nis required to send a pint of water into the state of steam. This\r\nenergy, when it is released by the condensation of water into rain or\r\nsnow, becomes again heat, and tends somewhat, as does the fire in the\r\nchimney, to accelerate the upward passage of the air. The result is\r\nthat the water which ascends in the equatorial updraught becomes what\r\nwe may term fuel to promote this important element in the earth's\r\naërial circulation. Trades and counter trades would doubtless exist\r\nbut for the efficiency of this updraught, which is caused by the\r\ncondensation of watery vapour, but the movement would be much less\r\nthan it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHIRLING STORMS.\r\n\r\nIn the region near the equator, or near the line of highest\r\ntemperature, which for various reasons does not exactly follow the\r\nequator, there is, as we have noticed, a somewhat continuous uprushing\r\ncurrent where the air passes upward through an ascending chimney,\r\nwhich in a way girdles the sea-covered part of the earth. In this\r\nregion the movements of the air are to a great extent under the\r\ncontrol of the great continuous updraught. As we go to the north and\r\nsouth we enter realms where the air at the surface of the earth is, by\r\nthe heat which it acquires from contact with that surface, more or\r\nless impelled upward; but there being no permanent updraught for its\r\nescape, it from time to time breaks through the roof of cold air which\r\noverlies it and makes a temporary channel of passage. Going polarward\r\nfrom the equator, we first encounter these local and temporary\r\nupcastings of the air near the margin of the tropical belt. In these\r\ndistricts, at least over the warmer seas, during the time of the year\r\nwhen it is midsummer, and in the regions where the trade winds are not\r\nstrong enough to sweep the warm and moisture-laden air down to the\r\nequatorial belt, the upward tending strain of the atmosphere next the\r\nearth often becomes so strong that the overlying air is displaced,\r\nforming a channel through which the air swiftly passes. As the\r\nmoisture condenses in the way before noted, the energy set free serves\r\nto accelerate the updraught, and a hurricane is begun. At first the\r\nmovement is small and of no great speed, but as the amount of air\r\ntending upward is likely to be great, as is also the amount of\r\nmoisture which it contains, the aërial chimney is rapidly enlarged,\r\nand the speed of the rising air increased. The atmosphere next the\r\nsurface of the sea flows in toward the channel of escape; its passage\r\nis marked by winds which are blowing toward the centre. On the\r\nperiphery of the movement the particles move slowly, but as they win\r\ntheir way toward the centre they travel with accelerating velocity. On\r\nthe principle which determines the whirling movement of the water\r\nescaping through a hole in the bottom of a basin, the particles of the\r\nair do not move on straight lines toward the centre, but journey in\r\nspiral paths, at first along the surface, and then ascending.\r\n\r\nWe have noted the fact that in a basin of water the direction of the\r\nwhirling is what we may term accidental--that is, dependent on\r\nconditions so slight that they elude our observation--but in\r\nhurricanes a certain fact determines in an arbitrary way the direction\r\nin which the spin shall take place. As soon as such a movement of the\r\nair attains any considerable diameter, although in its beginning it\r\nmay have spun in a direction brought about by local accidents, it will\r\nbe affected by the diverse rates of travel, by virtue of the earth's\r\nrotation, of the air on its equatorial and polar sides. On the\r\nequatorial side this air is moving more rapidly than it is on the\r\npolar side. By observing the water passing from a basin this\r\nprinciple, with a few experiments, can be made plain. The result is to\r\ncause these great whirlwinds of the hurricanes of higher latitudes to\r\nwhirl round from right to left in the northern hemisphere and in the\r\nreverse way in the southern. The general system of the air currents\r\nstill further affects these, as other whirling storms, by driving\r\ntheir centres or chimneys over the surface of the earth. The principle\r\non which this is done may be readily understood by observing how the\r\nair shaft above a chimney, through which we may observe the smoke to\r\nrise during a time of calm, is drawn off to one side by the slight\r\ncurrent which exists even when we feel no wind; it may also be\r\ndiscerned in the little dust whirls which form in the streets on a\r\nsummer day when the air is not much disturbed. While they spin they\r\nmove on in the direction of the air drift. In this way a hurricane\r\noriginating in the Gulf of Mexico may gradually journey under the\r\ninfluence of the counter trades across the Antilles, or over southern\r\nFlorida, and thence pursue a devious northerly course, generally near\r\nthe Atlantic coast and in the path of the Gulf Stream, until it has\r\ntravelled a thousand miles or more toward the North Atlantic. The\r\nfarther it goes northward the less effectively it is fed with warm and\r\nmoisture-laden air, the feebler its movement becomes, until at length\r\nit is broken up by the variable winds which it encounters.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and, from the point of view of the navigator,\r\nimportant peculiarity of these whirls is that at their centre there is\r\na calm, similar in origin and nature to the calm under the equator\r\nbetween the trade-wind belts. Both these areas are in the field where\r\nthe air is ascending, and therefore at the surface of the earth does\r\nnot affect the sails of ships, though if men ever come to use flying\r\nmachines and sail through the tropics at a good height above the sea\r\nit will be sensible enough. The difference between the doldrum of the\r\nequator and that of the hurricane, besides their relative areas, is\r\nthat one is a belt and the other a disk. If the seafarer happens to\r\nsail on a path which leads him through the hurricane centre, he will\r\nfirst discern, as from the untroubled air and sea he approaches the\r\nperiphery of the storm, the horizon toward the disturbance beset by\r\ntroubled clouds, all moving in one direction. Entering beneath this\r\npall, he finds a steadily increasing wind, which in twenty miles of\r\nsailing may, and in a hundred miles surely will, compel him to take in\r\nall but his storm sails, and is likely to bring his ship into grave\r\nperil. The most furious winds the mariner knows are those which he\r\nencounters as he approaches the still centre. These trials are made\r\nthe more appalling by the fact that in the furious part of the whirl\r\nthe rain, condensing from the ascending air, falls in torrents, and\r\nthe electricity generated in the condensation gives rise to vivid\r\nlightning. If the storm-beset ship can maintain her way, in a score or\r\ntwo of miles of journey toward the centre, generally very quickly, it\r\npasses into the calm disk, where the winds, blowing upward, cease to\r\nbe felt. In this area the ship is not out of danger, for the waves,\r\nrolling in from the disturbed areas on either side, make a torment of\r\ncross seas, where it is hard to control the movements of a sailing\r\nvessel because the impulse of the winds is lost. Passing through this\r\ndisk of calm, the ship re-encounters in reverse order the furious\r\nportion of the whirl, afterward the lessening winds, until it escapes\r\nagain into the airs which are not involved in the great torment.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, before Dove's studies of storms had shown the laws of\r\nhurricane movement, unhappy shipmasters were likely to be caught and\r\nretained in hurricanes, and to battle with them for weeks until their\r\nvessels were beaten to pieces. Now the \"Sailing Directions,\" which are\r\nthe mariner's guide, enable him, from the direction of the winds and\r\nthe known laws of motion of the storm centre, to sail out of the\r\ndanger, so that in most cases he may escape calamity. It is otherwise\r\nwith the people who dwell upon the land over which these atmospheric\r\nconvulsions sweep. Fortunately, where these great whirlwinds trespass\r\non the continent, they quickly die out, because of the relative lack\r\nof moisture which serves to stimulate the uprush which creates them.\r\nThus in their more violent forms hurricanes are only felt near the\r\nsea, and generally on islands and peninsulas. There the hurricane\r\nwinds, by the swiftness of their movement, which often attains a speed\r\nof a hundred miles or more, apply a great deal of energy to all\r\nobstacles in their path. The pressure thus produced is only less\r\ndestructive than that which is brought about by the tornadoes, which\r\nare next to be described.\r\n\r\nThere is another effect from hurricanes which is even more destructive\r\nto life than that caused by the direct action of the wind. In these\r\nwhirlings great differences in atmospheric pressure are brought about\r\nin contiguous areas of sea. The result is a sudden elevation in the\r\nlevel of one part of the water. These disturbances, where the shore\r\nlands are low and thickly peopled, as is the case along the western\r\ncoast of the Bay of Bengal, may produce inundations which are terribly\r\ndestructive to life and property. They are known also in southern\r\nFlorida and along the islands of the Caribbean, but in that region are\r\nnot so often damaging to mankind.\r\n\r\nFortunately, hurricanes are limited to a very small part of the\r\ntropical district. They occur only in those regions, on the eastern\r\nfaces of tropical lands, where the general westerly set of the winds\r\nfavours the accumulation of great bodies of very warm, moist air next\r\nthe surface of the sea. The western portion of the Gulf of Mexico and\r\nthe Caribbean, the Bay of Bengal, and the southeastern portion of Asia\r\nare especially liable to their visitations. They sometimes develop,\r\nthough with less fury, in other parts of the tropics. On the western\r\ncoast of South America and Africa, where the oceans are visited by the\r\ndry land winds, and where the waters are cooled by currents setting\r\nin from high latitudes, they are unknown.\r\n\r\nOnly less in order of magnitude than the hurricanes are the circular\r\nstorms known as cyclones. These occur on the continents, especially\r\nwhere they afford broad plains little interrupted by mountain ranges.\r\nThey are particularly well exhibited in that part of North America\r\nnorth of Mexico and south of Hudson Bay. Like the hurricanes, they\r\nappear to be due to the inrush of relatively warm air entering an\r\nupdraught which had been formed in the overlying, cooler portions of\r\nthe atmosphere. They are, however, much less energetic, and often of\r\ngreater size than the hurricane whirl. The lack of energy is probably\r\ndue to the comparative dryness of the air. The greater width of the\r\nascending column may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that,\r\noriginating at a considerable height above the sea, they have a less\r\nthickness of air to break through, and so the upward setting column is\r\nreadily made broad.\r\n\r\nThe cyclones of North America appear generally to originate in the\r\nregion of the Rocky Mountains, though it is probable that in some\r\ninstances, perhaps in many, the upward set of the air which begins the\r\nstorm originates in the ocean along the Pacific coast. They gather\r\nenergy as they descend the great sloping plain leading eastward from\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to the central portion of the great continental\r\nvalley. Thence they move on across the country to the Atlantic coast.\r\nNot infrequently they continue on over the ocean to the European\r\ncontinent. The eastward passage of the storm centre is due to the\r\nprevailing eastward movement of the air in its upper part throughout\r\nthat portion of the northern hemisphere. Commonly they incline\r\nsomewhat to the northward of east in their journey. In all cases the\r\nwinds appear to blow spirally into the common storm centre. There is\r\nthe same doldrum area or calm field in the centre of the storm that we\r\nnote between the trade winds and in the middle of a hurricane disk,\r\nthough this area is less defined than in the other instances, and the\r\nforward motion of the storm at a considerable speed is in most cases\r\ncharacteristic of the disturbance. On the front of one of these storms\r\nin North America the winds commonly begin in the northeast, thence\r\nthey veer by the east to the southwest. At this stage in the movement\r\nthe storm centre has passed by, the rainfall commonly ceases, and\r\ncold, dry winds setting to the northwestward set in. This is caused by\r\nthe fact that the ascending air, having attained a height above the\r\nearth, settles down behind the storm, forming an anticyclone or mass\r\nof dry air, which presses against the retreating side of the great\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nIn front of the storm the warm and generally moist relatively warm\r\nair, pressing in toward the point of uprise and overlaid by the upper\r\ncold air, is brought into a condition where it tends to form small\r\nsubordinate shafts up through which it whirls on the same principle,\r\nbut with far greater intensity than the main ascending column. The\r\nreason for the violence of this movement is that the difference in\r\ntemperature of the air next the surface and that at the height of a\r\nfew thousand feet is great. As might be expected, these local\r\nspinnings are most apt to occur in the season when the air next the\r\nearth is relatively warm, and they are aptest to take place in the\r\nhalf of the advancing front lying between the east and south, for the\r\nreason that there the highest temperatures and the greatest humidity\r\nare likely to coexist. In that part of the field, during the time when\r\nthe storm is advancing from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic, a\r\ndozen or more of these spinning uprushes may be produced, though few\r\nof them are likely to be of large size or of great intensity.\r\n\r\nThe secondary storms of cyclones, such as are above noted, receive the\r\nname of tornadoes. They are frequent and terrible visitations of the\r\ncountry from northern Texas, Florida, and Alabama to about the line of\r\nthe Great Lakes; they are rarely developed in the region west of\r\ncentral Kansas, and only occasionally do they exhibit much energy in\r\nthe region east of the plain-lands of the Ohio Valley. Although known\r\nin other lands, they nowhere, so far as our observations go, exhibit\r\nthe paroxysmal intensity which they show in the central portion of the\r\nNorth American continent. There the air which they affect acquires a\r\nspeed of movement and a fury of action unknown in any other\r\natmospheric disturbances, even in those of the hurricanes.\r\n\r\nThe observer who has a chance to note from an advantageous position\r\nthe development of a tornado observes that in a tolerably still air,\r\nor at least an air unaffected by violent winds--generally in what is\r\ntermed a \"sultry\" state of the atmosphere--the storm clouds in the\r\ndistance begin to form a kind of funnel-shaped dependence, which\r\ngradually extends until it appears to touch the earth. As the clouds\r\nare low, this downward-growing column probably in no case is observed\r\nfor the height of more than three or four thousand feet. As the funnel\r\ndescends, the clouds above and about it may be seen to take on a\r\nwhirling movement around the centre, and under favourable\r\ncircumstances an uprush of vapours may be noted in the centre of the\r\nswaying shaft. As the whirl comes nearer, the roar of the disturbance,\r\nwhich at a distance is often compared to the sound made by a threshing\r\nmachine or to that of distant musketry, increases in loudness until it\r\nbecomes overwhelming. When a storm such as this strikes a building, it\r\nis not only likely to be razed by the force of the wind, but it may be\r\nexploded, as by the action of gunpowder fired within its walls,\r\nthrough the sudden expansion of the air which it contains. In the\r\ncentre of the column, although it rarely has a diameter of more than a\r\nfew hundred feet, the uprush is so swift that it makes a partial\r\nvacuum. The air, striving to get into the space which it is eager to\r\noccupy, is whirling about at such a rate that the centrifugal motion\r\nwhich it thus acquires restrains its entrance. In this way there may\r\nbe, as the column rapidly moves by, a difference of pressure\r\namounting probably to what the mercury of a barometer would indicate\r\nby four or five inches of fall. Unless the structure is small and its\r\nwalls strong, its roof and sides are apt to be blown apart by this\r\ndifference of pressure and the consequent expansion of the contained\r\nair. In some cases where wooden buildings have withstood this curious\r\naction the outer clapboards have been blown off by the expansion of\r\nthe small amount of air contained in the interspaces between that\r\ncovering and the lath and plaster within (see Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Showing effect of expansion of air contained\r\nin a hollow wall during the passage of the storm.]\r\n\r\nThe blow of the air due to its rotative whirling has in several cases\r\nproved sufficient to throw a heavy locomotive from the track of a\r\nwell-constructed railway. In all cases where it is intense it will\r\noverturn the strongest trees. The ascending wind in the centre of the\r\ncolumn may sometimes lift the bodies of men and of animals, as well as\r\nthe branches and trunks of trees and the timber of houses, to the\r\nheight of hundreds of feet above the surface. One of the most striking\r\nexhibitions of the upsucking action in a tornado is afforded by the\r\neffect which it produces when it crosses a small sheet of water. In\r\ncertain cases where, in the Northwestern States of this country, the\r\npath of the storm lay over the pool, the whole of the water from a\r\nbasin acres in extent has been entirely carried away, leaving the\r\nsurface, as described by an observer, apparently dry enough to plough.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the interests of man, as well as those of the lower\r\norganic life, the paths of these storms, or at least the portion of\r\ntheir track where the violence of the air movement makes them very\r\ndestructive, often does not exceed five hundred feet in width, and is\r\nrarely as great as half a mile in diameter. In most cases the length\r\nof the journey of an individual tornado does not exceed thirty miles.\r\nIt rarely if ever amounts to twice that distance.\r\n\r\nIn every regard except their small size and their violence these\r\ntornadoes closely resemble hurricanes. There is the same broad disk of\r\nair next the surface spirally revolving toward the ascending centre,\r\nwhere its motion is rapidly changed from a horizontal to a vertical\r\ndirection. The energy of the uprush in both cases is increased by the\r\nenergy set free through the condensation of the water, which tends\r\nfurther to heat and thus to expand the air. The smaller size of the\r\ntornado may be accounted for by the fact that we have in their\r\noriginating conditions a relatively thin layer of warm, moist air next\r\nthe earth and a relatively very cold layer immediately overlying it.\r\nThus the tension which serves to start the movement is intense, though\r\nthe masses involved are not very great. The short life of a tornado\r\nmay be explained by the fact that, though it apparently tends to grow\r\nin width and energy, the central spout is small, and is apt to be\r\nbroken by the movements of the atmosphere, which in the front of a\r\ncyclone are in all cases irregular.\r\n\r\nOn the warmer seas, but often beyond the limits of the tropics,\r\nanother class of spinning storms, known as waterspouts, may often be\r\nobserved. In general appearance these air whirls resemble tornadoes,\r\nexcept that they are in all cases smaller than that group of\r\nwhirlings. As in the tornadoes, the waterspout begins with a funnel,\r\nwhich descends from the sky to the surface of the sea. Up the tube\r\nvapours may be seen ascending at great speed, the whole appearing like\r\na gigantic pillar of swiftly revolving smoke. When the whirl reaches\r\nthe water, it is said that the fluid leaps up into the tube in the\r\nform of dense spray, an assertion which, in view of the fact of the\r\naction of a tornado on a lake as before described, may well be\r\nbelieved. Like the tornadoes and dust whirls, the life of a waterspout\r\nappears to be brief. They rarely endure for more than a few minutes,\r\nor journey over the sea for more than two or three miles before the\r\ncolumn appears to be broken by some swaying of the atmosphere. As\r\nthese peculiar storms are likely to damage ships, the old-fashioned\r\nsailors were accustomed to fire at them with cannon. It has been\r\nclaimed that a shot would break the tube and end the little\r\nconvulsion. This, in view of the fact that they appear to be easily\r\nbroken up by relatively trifling air currents, may readily be\r\nbelieved. The danger which these disturbances bring to ships is\r\nprobably not very serious.\r\n\r\nThe special atmospheric conditions which bring about the formation of\r\nwaterspouts are not well known; they doubtless include, however, warm,\r\nmoist air next the surface of the sea and cold air above. Just why\r\nthese storms never attain greater size or endurance is not yet known.\r\nThese disturbances have been seen for centuries, but as yet they have\r\nnot been, in the scientific sense, observed. Their picturesqueness\r\nattracts all beholders; it is interesting to note the fact that\r\nperhaps the earliest description of their phenomena--one which takes\r\naccount in the scientific spirit of all the features which they\r\npresent--was written by the poet Camoëns in the Lusiad, in which he\r\nstrangely mingles fancy and observation in his account of the great\r\nvoyage of Vasco da Gama. The poet even notes that the water which\r\nfalls when the spout is broken is not salt, but fresh--a point which\r\nclearly proves that not much of the water which the tube contains is\r\nderived from the sea. It is, in fact, watery vapour drawn from the air\r\nnext the surface of the ocean, and condensed in its ascent through the\r\ntube. In this and other descriptions of Nature Camoëns shows more of\r\nthe scientific spirit than any other poet of his time. He was in this\r\nregard the first of modern writers to combine a spiritual admiration\r\nfor Nature with some sense of its scientific meaning.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the atmosphere, meteorologists base their studies\r\nlargely on changes in the weight of that medium, which they determine\r\nby barometric observations. In fact, the science of the air had its\r\nbeginning in Pascal's admirable observation on the changes in the\r\nheight of a column of mercury contained in a bent tube as he ascended\r\nthe volcanic peak known as Puy de Dome, in central France. As before\r\nnoted, it is to the disturbances in the weight of the air, brought\r\nabout mainly by variations in temperature, that we owe all its\r\ncurrents, and it is upon these winds that the features we term climate\r\nin largest measure depend. Every movement of the winds is not only\r\nbrought about by changes in the relative weight of the air at certain\r\npoints, but the winds themselves, owing to the momentum which the air\r\nattains by them, serve to bring about alterations in the quantity of\r\nair over different parts of the earth, which are marked most\r\ndistinctly by barometric variations. These changes are exceedingly\r\ncomplicated; a full account of them would demand the space of this\r\nvolume. A few of the facts, however, should be presented here. In the\r\nfirst place, we note that each day there is normally a range in the\r\npressure which causes the barometer to be at the lowest at about four\r\no'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon, and highest\r\nat about ten o'clock in those divisions of the day. This change is\r\nsupposed to be due to the fact that the motes of dust in the\r\natmosphere in the night, becoming cooled, condense the water vapour\r\nupon their surfaces, thus diminishing the volume of the air. When the\r\nsun rises the water evaporated by the heat returns from these little\r\nstorehouses into the body of the atmosphere. Again in the evening the\r\ncondensation sets in; at the same time the air tends to drift in from\r\nthe region to the westward, where the sun is still high, toward the\r\nfield where the barometer has been thus lowered; the current gradually\r\nattains a certain volume, and so brings about the rise of the\r\nbarometer about ten o'clock at night.\r\n\r\nIn the winter time, particularly on the well-detached continent of\r\nNorth America, we find a prevailing high barometer in the interior of\r\nthe country and a corresponding low state of pressure on the Atlantic\r\nOcean. In the summer season these conditions are on the whole\r\nreversed.\r\n\r\nUnder the tropics, in the doldrum belt, there is a zone of low\r\nbarometer connected to the ascending currents which take place along\r\nthat line. This is a continuous manifestation of the same action which\r\ngives a large area of a disklike form in the centre or eye of the\r\nhurricane and in the middle portion of the tornado's whirl. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that the weight of the air is greatest in the\r\nregions from which it is blowing toward the points of upward escape,\r\nand least in and about those places where the superincumbent air is\r\nrising through a temporary or permanent line of escape. In other\r\nwords, ascending air means generally a relatively low barometer, while\r\ndescending air is accompanied by greater pressure in the field upon\r\nwhich it falls.\r\n\r\nIn almost every part of the earth which is affected by a particular\r\nphysiography we find that the movements of the atmosphere next the\r\nsurface are qualified by the condition which it encounters. In fact,\r\nif a person were possessed of all the knowledge which could be\r\nobtained concerning winds, he could probably determine as by a map the\r\nplace where he might chance to find himself, provided he could extend\r\nhis observations over a term of years. In other words, the regimen of\r\nthe winds--at least those of a superficial nature--is almost as\r\ncharacteristic of the field over which they go as is a map of the\r\ncountry. Of these special winds a number of the more important have\r\nbeen noted, only a few of which we can advert to. First among these\r\nmay well come the land and sea breezes which are remarked about all\r\nislands which are not continuously swept by permanent winds. One of\r\nthe most characteristic instances of these alternate winds is perhaps\r\nthat afforded on the island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe island of Jamaica is so situated within the basin of the Caribbean\r\nthat it does not feel the full influence of the trades. It has a range\r\nof high mountains through its middle part. In the daytime the surface\r\nof the land, which has the sun overhead twice each year, and is always\r\nexposed to nearly vertical radiation, becomes intensely hot, so that\r\nan upcurrent is formed. The formation of this current is favoured by\r\nthe mountains, which apply a part of the heat at the height of about a\r\nmile above the surface of the sea. This action is parallel to that we\r\nnotice when, in order to create a draught in the air of a chimney, we\r\nput a torch some distance up above the fireplace, thus diminishing the\r\nheight of the column of air which has to be set in motion. It is\r\nfurther shown by the fact that when miners sought to make an upcurrent\r\nin a shaft, in order to lead pure air into the workings through other\r\nopenings, they found after much experience that it was better to have\r\nthe fire near the top of the shaft rather than at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe ascending current being induced up the mountain sides of Jamaica,\r\nthe air is forced in from the sea to the relatively free space. Before\r\nnoon the current, aided in its speed by a certain amount of the\r\ncondensation of the watery vapour before described, attains the\r\nproportions of a strong wind. As the sun begins to sink, the earth's\r\nsurface pours forth its heat; the radiation being assisted by the\r\nextended surfaces of the plants, cooling rapidly takes place.\r\nMeanwhile the sea, because of the great heat-storing power of water,\r\nis very little cooled, the ascent of the air ceases, the temporary\r\nchimney with its updraught is replaced by a downward current, and the\r\nwinds blow from the land until the sun comes again to reverse the\r\ncurrent. In many cases these movements of the daily winds flowing into\r\nand from islands induce a certain precipitation of moisture in the\r\nform of rain. Generally, however, their effect is merely to ameliorate\r\nthe heat by bringing alternately currents from the relatively cool sea\r\nand from the upper atmosphere to lessen the otherwise excessive\r\ntemperature of the fields which they traverse.\r\n\r\nAlthough characteristic sea and land winds are limited to regions\r\nwhere the sun's heat is great, they are traceable even in high\r\nlatitudes during the periods of long-continued calm attended with\r\nclear skies. Thus on the island of Martha's Vineyard, in\r\nMassachusetts, the writer has noted, when the atmosphere was in such a\r\nstate, distinct night and day, or sea and land, breezes coming in\r\ntheir regular alternation. During the night when these alternate winds\r\nprevail the central portion of the island, at the distance of three\r\nmiles from the sea, is remarkably cold, the low temperature being due\r\nto the descending air current. To the same physical cause may be\r\nattributed the frequent insets of the sea winds toward midday along\r\nthe continental shores of various countries. Thus along the coast of\r\nNew England in the summer season a clear, still, hot day is certain to\r\nlead to the creation of an ingoing tide of air, which reaches some\r\nmiles into the interior. This stream from the sea enters as a thin\r\nwedge, it often being possible to note next the shore when the\r\nmovement begins a difference of ten degrees of temperature between the\r\nsurface of the ground to which the point of the wedge has attained,\r\nand a position twenty feet higher in the air. This is a beautiful\r\nexample to show at once how the relative weight of the atmosphere,\r\neven when the differences are slight, may bring about motion, and also\r\nhow masses of the atmosphere may move by or through the rest of the\r\nmedium in a way which we do not readily conceive from our observations\r\non the transparent mass. Very few people have any idea how general is\r\nthe truth that the air, even in continuous winds, tends to move in\r\nmore or less individualized masses. This, however, is made very\r\nevident by watching the gusts of a storm or the wandering patches of\r\nwind which disturb the surface of an otherwise smooth sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _South shore, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, showing\r\na characteristic sand beach with long slope and low dunes. Note the\r\nthree lines of breakers and the splash flows cutting little bays in\r\nthe sand._]\r\n\r\nAmong the notable local winds are those which from their likeness to\r\nthe Föhn of the Swiss valleys receive that name. Föhns are produced\r\nwhere a body of air blowing against the slope of a continuous mountain\r\nrange is lifted to a considerable height, and, on passing over the\r\ncrest, falls again to a low position. In its ascent the air is cooled,\r\nrarefied, and to a great extent deprived of its moisture. In\r\ndescending it is recondensed, and by the process by which its atoms\r\nare brought together its latent heat is made sensible. There being but\r\nlittle watery vapour in the mass, this heat is not much called for by\r\nthat heat-storing fluid, and so the air is warmed. So far Föhn winds\r\nhave only been remarked as conspicuous features in Switzerland and on\r\nthe eastern face of the Rocky Mountains. In the region about the head\r\nwaters of the Missouri and to the northward their influence in what\r\nare called the Chinook winds is distinctly to ameliorate the severe\r\nwinter climate of the country.\r\n\r\nIn almost all great desert regions, particularly in the typical\r\nSahara, we find a variety of storm belonging to the whirlwind group,\r\nwhich, owing to the nature of the country, take on special\r\ncharacteristics. These desert storms take up from the verdureless\r\nearth great quantities of sand and other fine _débris_, which often so\r\nclouds the air as to bring the darkness of night at midday. Their\r\nwhirlings appear in size to be greater than those which produce\r\ntornadoes or waterspouts, but less than hurricanes or cyclones.\r\nLittle, however, is known about them. They have not been well\r\nobserved by meteorologists. In some ways they are important, for the\r\nreason that they serve to carry the desert sand into regions\r\npreviously verdure-clad, and thus to extend the bounds of the desolate\r\nfields in which they originate. Where they blow off to the seaward,\r\nthey convey large quantities of dust into the ocean, and thus serve to\r\nwear down the surface of the land in regions where there are no rivers\r\nto effect that action in the normal way.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its swift motion when impelled by differences in\r\nweight, the movements of the air have had but little direct and\r\nimmediate influence on the surface of the earth. The greater part of\r\nthe work which it does, as we shall see hereafter, is done through the\r\nwaters which it impels and bears about. Yet where winds blow over\r\nverdureless surfaces the effect of the sand which they sweep before\r\nthem is often considerable. In regions of arid mountains the winds\r\noften drive trains of sand through the valleys, where the sharp\r\nparticles cut the rocks almost as effectively as torrents of water\r\nwould, distributing the wearing over the width of the valley. The dust\r\nthus blown, from a desert region may, when it attains a country\r\ncovered with vegetation, gradually accumulate on its surface, forming\r\nvery thick deposits. Thus in northwestern China there is a wide area\r\nwhere dust accumulations blown from the arid districts of central Asia\r\nhave gradually heaped up in the course of ages to the depth of\r\nthousands of feet, and this although much of the _débris_ is\r\ncontinually being borne away by the action of the rain waters as they\r\njourney toward the sea. Such dust accumulations occur in other parts\r\nof the world, particularly in the districts about the upper\r\nMississippi and in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains, but nowhere are\r\nthey so conspicuous as in the region first mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhere prevailing winds from the sea, from great lakes, and even from\r\nconsiderable rivers, blow against sandy shores or cliffs of the same\r\nnature, large quantities of sand and dust are often driven inland\r\nfrom the coast line. In most cases these wind-borne materials take on\r\nthe form of dunes, or heaps of sand, varying from a few feet to\r\nseveral hundred feet in height. It is characteristic of these hills of\r\nblown sand that they move across the face of the country. Under\r\nfavourable conditions they may journey scores of miles from the shore.\r\nThe marching of a dune is effected through the rolling up of the sand\r\non the windward side of the elevation, when it is impelled by the\r\ncurrent of air to the crest where it falls into the lee or shelter\r\nwhich the hill makes to the wind. In this way in the course of a day\r\nthe centre of the dune, if the wind be blowing furiously, may advance\r\na measurable distance from the place it occupied before. By fits and\r\nstarts this ongoing may be indefinitely continued. A notable and\r\npicturesque instance of the march of a great dune may be had from the\r\ncase in which one of them overwhelmed in the last century the village\r\nof Eccles in southeastern England. The advancing sand gradually crept\r\ninto the hamlet, and in the course of a decade dispossessed the people\r\nby burying their houses. In time the summit of the church spire\r\ndisappeared from view, and for many years thereafter all trace of the\r\nhamlet was lost. Of late years, however, the onward march of the sands\r\nhas disclosed the church spire, and in the course of another century\r\nthe place may be revealed on its original site, unchanged except that\r\nthe marching hill will be on its other side.\r\n\r\nIn the region about the head of the Bay of Biscay the quantity of\r\nthese marching sands is so great that at one time they jeopardized the\r\nagriculture of a large district. The French Government has now\r\nsucceeded, by carefully planting the surface of the country with\r\ngrasses and other herbs which will grow in such places, in checking\r\nthe movement of the wind-blown materials. By so doing they have merely\r\nhastened the process by which Nature arrests the march of dunes. As\r\nthese heaps creep away from the sea, they generally come into regions\r\nwhere a greater variety of plants flourish; moreover, their sand\r\ngrains become decayed, so that they afford a better soil. Gradually\r\nthe mat of vegetation binds them down, and in time covers them over so\r\nthat only the expert eye can recognise their true nature. Only in\r\ndesert regions can the march of these heaps be maintained for great\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic dunes occur from point to point all along the Atlantic\r\ncoast from the State of Maine to the northern coast of Florida. They\r\nalso occur along the coasts of our Great Lakes, being particularly\r\nwell developed at the southern end of Lake Michigan, where they form,\r\nperhaps, the most notable accumulations within the limits of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen blown sands invade a forest and the deposit is rapidly\r\naccumulated, the trees are often buried in an undecayed condition. In\r\nthis state, with certain chemical reactions which may take place in\r\nthe mass, the woody matter is apt to become replaced by silex\r\ndissolved from the sand, which penetrates the tissues of the plants.\r\nIn this way salicified forests are produced, such as are found in the\r\nregion of the Rocky Mountains, where the trunks of the trees, now very\r\nhard stone, so perfectly preserve their original structure that when\r\ncut and polished they may be used for decorative purposes. Conspicuous\r\nas is this work of the dunes, it is in a geological way much less\r\nimportant than that accomplished by the finer dust which drifts from\r\none region of land to another or into the sea. Because of their\r\nweight, the sand grains journey over the surface of the earth, except,\r\nindeed, where they are uplifted by whirl storms. They thus can not\r\ntravel very fast or far. Dust, however, rises into the air, and\r\njourneys for indefinite distances. We thus see how slight differences\r\nin the weight of substances may profoundly affect the conditions of\r\ntheir deportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SYSTEM OF WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe envelope of air wraps the earth completely about, and, though\r\nvarying in thickness, is everywhere present over its surface. That of\r\nthe waters is much less equally distributed. Because of its weight, it\r\nis mainly gathered in the depths of the earth, where it lies in the\r\ninterstices of the rocks and in the great realm of the seas. Only a\r\nvery small portion of the fluid is in the atmosphere or on the land.\r\nPerhaps less than a ten thousandth part of the whole is at any one\r\ntime on this round from the seas through the air to the land and back\r\nto the great reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe great water store of the earth is contained in two distinct\r\nrealms--in the oceans, where the fluid is concentrated in a quantity\r\nwhich fills something like nine tenths of the hollows formed by the\r\ncorrugations of the earth's surface; and in the rocks, where it is\r\nstored in a finely divided form, partly between the grains of the\r\nstony matter and partly in the substance of its crystals, where it\r\nexists in a combination, the precise nature of which is not well\r\nknown, but is called water of crystallization. On the average, it\r\nseems likely that the materials of the earth, whether under the sea or\r\non the land, have several per cent of their mass of the fluid.\r\n\r\nIt is not yet known to what depth the water-bearing section of the\r\nearth extends; but, as we shall see more particularly hereafter when\r\nwe come to consider volcanoes, the lavas which they send up to the\r\nsurface are full of contained water, which passes from them in the\r\nform of steam. The very high temperature of these volcanic ejections\r\nmakes it necessary for us to suppose that they come from a great\r\ndepth. It is difficult to believe that they originate at less than a\r\nhundred miles below the earth's surface. If, then, the rocks contain\r\nan average of even five per cent of water to the depth of one hundred\r\nmiles, the quantity of the fluid stored within the earth is greater\r\nthan that which is contained in the reservoir of the ocean. The\r\noceans, on the average, are not more than three miles deep; spread\r\nevenly over the surface of the whole earth, their depth would be less\r\nthan two miles, while the water in the rocks, if it could be added to\r\nthe seas, would make the total depth seven miles or more. As we shall\r\nnote hereafter, the processes of formation of strata tend to imprison\r\nwater in the beds, which in time is returned to the earth's surface by\r\nthe forces which operate within the crust.\r\n\r\nAlthough the water in the seas is, as we have seen, probably less than\r\none half of the store which the earth possesses, the part it plays in\r\nthe economy of the planet is in the highest measure important. The\r\nunderground water operates solely to promote certain changes which\r\ntake place in the mineral realm. Its effect, except in volcanic\r\nprocesses, are brought about but slowly, and are limited in their\r\naction. The movements of this buried water are exceedingly gradual;\r\nthe forces which impel it about and which bring it to do its work\r\noriginate in the earth. In the seas the fluid has an exceeding freedom\r\nof motion; it can obey the varied impulses which the solar energy\r\nimposes upon it. The rôle of these wonderful actions which we are\r\nabout to trace includes almost everything which goes on upon the\r\nsurface of the planet--that which relates to the development of animal\r\nand vegetable life, as well as to the vast geological changes which\r\nthe earth is undergoing.\r\n\r\nIf the surface of the earth were uniformly covered with water to the\r\ndepth of ten thousand feet or more, every particle of fluid would, in\r\na measure, obey the attraction of the sun, of the moon, and,\r\ntheoretically, also of all the other bodies in space, on the principle\r\nthat every particle of matter in the universe exercises a gravitative\r\neffect on every other. As it is, owing to the divided condition of the\r\nwater on the earth's surface, only that which is in the ocean and\r\nlarger seas exhibits any measurable influence from these distant\r\nattractions. In fact, only the tides produced by the moon and sun are\r\nof determinable magnitude, and of these the lunar is of greater\r\nimportance, the reason being the near position of our satellite to our\r\nown sphere. The solar tide is four tenths as great as the lunar. The\r\nwater doubtless obeys in a slight way the attraction of the other\r\ncelestial bodies, but the motions thus imparted are too small to be\r\ndiscerned; they are lost in the great variety of influences which\r\naffect all the matter on the earth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tides are due to the attraction of the solar bodies,\r\nmainly to that of the moon, the mode in which the result is brought\r\nabout is somewhat complicated. It may briefly and somewhat\r\nincompletely be stated as follows: Owing to the fact that the\r\nattracting power of the earth is about eighty times greater than that\r\nof the moon, the centre of gravity of the two bodies lies within the\r\nearth. About this centre the spheres revolve, each in a way swinging\r\naround the other. At this point there is no centrifugal motion arising\r\nfrom the revolution of the pair of spheres, but on the side of the\r\nearth opposite the moon, some six thousand miles away, the centrifugal\r\nforce is considerable, becoming constantly greater as we pass away\r\nfrom the turning point. At the same time the attraction of the moon on\r\nthe water becomes less. Thus the tide opposite the satellite is\r\nformed. On the side toward the moon the same centrifugal action\r\noperates, though less effectively than in the other case, for the\r\nreason that the turning point is nearer the surface; but this action\r\nis re-enforced by the greater attraction of the moon, due to the fact\r\nthat the water is much nearer that body.\r\n\r\nIn the existing conditions of the earth, what we may call the normal\r\nrun of the tides is greatly interrupted. Only in the southern ocean\r\ncan the waters obey the lunar and solar attraction in anything like a\r\nnormal way. In that part of the earth two sets of tides are\r\ndiscernible, the one and greater due to the moon, the other, much\r\nsmaller, to the sun. As these tides travel round at different rates,\r\nthe movements which they produce are sometimes added to each other\r\nand sometimes subtracted--that is, at times they come together, while\r\nagain the elevation of one falls in the hollow of the other. Once\r\nagain supposing the earth to be all ocean covered, computation shows\r\nthat the tides in such a sea would be very broad waves, having,\r\nindeed, a diameter of half the earth's circumference. Those produced\r\nby the moon would have an altitude of about one foot, and those by the\r\nsun of about three inches. The geological effects of these swayings\r\nwould be very slight; the water would pass over the bottom to and fro\r\ntwice each day, with a maximum journey of a hundred or two feet each\r\nway from a fixed point. This movement would be so slow that it could\r\nnot stir the fine sediment; its only influence would perhaps be to\r\nhelp feed the animals which were fixed upon the bottom by drawing the\r\nnurture-bringing water by their mouths.\r\n\r\nAlthough the divided condition of the ocean perturbs the action of the\r\ntides, so that except by chance their waves are rarely with their\r\ncentres where the attracting bodies tend to make them, the influence\r\nof these divisions is greatly to increase the geological or\r\nchange-bringing influences arising from these movements. When from the\r\nsouthern ocean the tides start to the northward up the bays of the\r\nAtlantic, the Pacific, or the Indian Ocean, they have, as before\r\nnoted, a height of perhaps less than two feet. As they pass up the\r\nnarrowing spaces the waves become compressed--that is, an equal volume\r\nof moving water has less horizontal room for its passage, and is\r\nforced to rise higher. We see a tolerably good illustration of the\r\nsame principle when we observe a wind-made wave enter a small recess\r\nof the shore, the sides of which converge in the direction of the\r\nmotion. With the diminished room, the wave gains in height. It thus\r\ncomes about that the tide throughout the Atlantic basin is much higher\r\nthan in the southern ocean. On the same principle, when the tide rolls\r\nin against the shores every embayment of a distinct kind, whose sides\r\nconverge toward the head, packs up the tidal wave, often increasing\r\nits height in a remarkable way. When these bays are wide-mouthed and\r\nof elongate triangular form, with deep bottoms, the tides which on\r\ntheir outer parts have a height of ten or fifteen feet may attain an\r\naltitude of forty or fifty feet at the apex of the triangle.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that the tide, such as runs in the\r\nsouthern ocean, exercises little or no influence upon the bottom of\r\nthe sea over which it moves. As the height of the confined waters\r\nincreases, the range of their journey over the bottom as the wave\r\ncomes and goes rapidly increases. When they have an elevation of ten\r\nfeet they can probably stir the finer mud on the ocean floor, and in\r\nshallow water move yet heavier particles. In the embayments of the\r\nland, where a great body of water journeys like an alternating river\r\ninto extensive basins, the tidal action becomes intense; the current\r\nmay be able to sweep along large stones quite as effectively as a\r\nmountain torrent. Thus near Eastport, Me., where the tides have a\r\nmaximum rise and fall of over twenty feet, the waters rush in places\r\nso swiftly that at certain stages of the movement they are as much\r\ntroubled as those at the rapids of the St. Lawrence. In such portions\r\nof the shore the tides do important work in carving channels into the\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of the continents about the North Atlantic, where the\r\ntides act in a vigorous manner, we almost everywhere find an\r\nunderwater shelf extending from the shore with a declivity of only\r\nfive to ten feet to the mile toward the centre of the sea, until the\r\ndepth of about five hundred feet is attained; from this point the\r\nbottom descends more steeply into the ocean's depth. It is probable\r\nthat the larger part of the material composing these continental\r\nshelves has been brought to its position by tidal action. Each time\r\nthe tidal wave sweeps in toward the shore it urges the finer particles\r\nof sediment along with it. When it moves out it drags them on the\r\nreturn journey toward the depths of the sea. If this shelf were\r\nperfectly horizontal, the two journeys of the sand and mud grains\r\nwould be of the same length; but as the movement takes place up and\r\ndown a slope, the bits will travel farther under the impulse which\r\nleads them downward than under that which impels them up. The result\r\nwill be that the particles will travel a little farther out from the\r\nshore each time it is swung to and fro in the alternating movement of\r\nthe tide.\r\n\r\nThe effect of tidal movement in nurturing marine life is very great.\r\nIt aids the animals fixed on the bottoms of the deep seas to obtain\r\ntheir provision of food and their share of oxygen by drawing the water\r\nby their bodies. All regions which are visited by strong tides\r\ncommonly have in the shallows near the shores a thick growth of\r\nseaweed which furnishes an ample provision of food for the fishes and\r\nother forms of animal life.\r\n\r\nA peculiar effect arising from tidal action is believed by students of\r\nthe phenomena to be found in the slowing of the earth's rotation on\r\nits axis. The tides rotate around the earth from east to west, or\r\nrather, we should say, the solid mass of the earth rubs against them\r\nas it spins from west to east. As they move over the bottom and as\r\nthey strike against the shores this push of the great waves tends in a\r\nslight measure to use up the original spinning impulse which causes\r\nthe earth's rotation. Computation shows that the amount of this action\r\nshould be great enough gradually to lengthen the day, or the time\r\noccupied by the earth in making a complete revolution on the polar\r\naxis. The effect ought to be great enough to be measurable by\r\nastronomers in the course of a thousand years. On the other hand, the\r\nrecords of ancient eclipses appear pretty clearly to show that the\r\nlength of the day has not changed by as much as a second in the course\r\nof three thousand years. This evidence does not require us to abandon\r\nthe supposition that the tides tend to diminish the earth's rate of\r\nrotation. It is more likely that the effect of the reduction in the\r\nearth's diameter due to the loss of heat which is continually going on\r\ncounterbalances the influence of the tidal friction. As the diameter\r\nof a rotating body diminishes, the tendency is for the mass to spin\r\nmore rapidly; if it expands, to turn more slowly, provided in each\r\ncase the amount of the impulse which leads to the turning remains the\r\nsame. This can be directly observed by whirling a small weight\r\nattached to a string in such a manner that the cord winds around the\r\nfinger with each revolution; it will be noted that as the line\r\nshortens the revolution is more quickly accomplished. We can readily\r\nconceive that the earth is made up of weights essentially like that\r\nused in the experiment, each being drawn toward the centre by the\r\ngravitative stress, which is like that applied to the weight by the\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the days remain of the same length through vast periods\r\nof time is probably due to this balance between the effects of tidal\r\naction and those arising from the loss of heat--in other words, we\r\nhave here one of those delicate arrangements in the way of\r\ncounterpoise which serve to maintain the balanced conditions of the\r\nearth's surface amid the great conflicts of diverse energies which are\r\nat work in and upon the sphere.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that the effects of the attraction which\r\nproduces tides are much more extensive than they are seen to be in the\r\nmovements of the sea. So long as the solar and planetary spheres\r\nremain fluid, the whole of their masses partake of the movement. It is\r\na consequence of this action, as the computations of Prof. George\r\nDarwin has shown, that the moon, once nearer the earth than it is at\r\npresent, has by a curious action of the tidal force been pushed away\r\nfrom the centre of our sphere, or rather the two bodies have repelled\r\neach other. An American student of the problem, Mr. T.J.J. See, has\r\nshown that the same action has served to give to the double stars the\r\nexceeding eccentricity of their orbits.\r\n\r\nAlthough these recent studies of tidal action in the celestial sphere\r\nare of the utmost importance to the theory of the universe, for they\r\nmay lead to changes in the nebular hypotheses, they are as yet too\r\nincomplete and are, moreover, too mathematical to be presented in an\r\nelementary treatise such as this.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now turn to another class of waves which are of even more\r\nimportance than those of the tides--to the undulations which are\r\nproduced by the action of the wind on the surface of the water. While\r\nthe tide waves are limited to the open ocean, and to the seas and bays\r\nwhich afford them free entrance, wind waves are produced everywhere\r\nwhere water is subjected to the friction of air which flows over it.\r\nWhile tidal waves come upon the shores but twice each day, the wind\r\nwaves of ordinary size which roll in from the ocean deliver their\r\nblows at intervals of from three to ten seconds. Although the tidal\r\nwaves sometimes, by a packing-up process, attain the height of fifty\r\nfeet, their average altitude where they come in contact with the shore\r\nprobably does not much exceed four feet; usually they come in gently.\r\nIt is likely that in a general way the ocean surges which beat against\r\nthe coast are of greater altitude.\r\n\r\nWind waves are produced and perform their work in a manner which we\r\nshall now describe. When the air blows over any resisting surface, it\r\ntends, in a way which we can hardly afford here to describe, to\r\nproduce motions. If the particle is free to move under the impulse\r\nwhich it communicates, it bears it along; if it is linked together in\r\nthe manner of large masses, which the wind can not transport, it tends\r\nto set it in motion in an alternating way. The sounds of our musical\r\ninstruments which act by wind are due to these alternating vibrations,\r\nsuch as all air currents tend to produce. An Æolian harp illustrates\r\nthe action which we are considering. Moving over matter which has the\r\nqualities that we denote by the term fluid, the swayings which the air\r\nproduces are of a peculiar sort, though they much resemble those of\r\nthe fiddle string. The surface of the liquid rises and falls in what\r\nwe term waves, the size of which is determined by the measure of\r\nfluidity, and by the energy of the wind. Thus, because fresh water is\r\nconsiderably lighter than salt, a given wind will produce in a given\r\ndistance for the run of the waves heavier surges in a lake than it\r\nwill in the sea. For this reason the surges in a great storm which\r\nroll on the ocean shore, because of the wide water over which they\r\nhave gathered their impetus, are in size very much greater than those\r\nof the largest lakes, which do not afford room for the development of\r\ngreat undulations.\r\n\r\nTo the eye, a wave in the water appears to indicate that the fluid is\r\nborne on before the wind. Examination, however, shows that the amount\r\nof motion in the direction in which the wind is blowing is very\r\nslight. We may say, indeed, that the essential feature of a wave is\r\nfound in the transmission of impulse rather than in the movement of\r\nthe fluid matter. A strip of carpet when shaken sends through its\r\nlength undulations which are almost exactly like water waves. If we\r\nimagine ourselves placed in a particle of water, moving in the\r\nswayings of a wave in the open and deep sea, we may conceive ourselves\r\ncarried around in an ellipse, in each revolution returning through\r\nnearly the same orbit. Now and then, when the particle came to the\r\nsurface, it would experience the slight drift which the continual\r\nfriction of the wind imposes on the water. If the wave in which the\r\njourney was made lay in the trade winds, where the long-continued,\r\nsteadfast blowing had set the water in motion to great depths, the\r\norbit traversed would be moving forward with some rapidity; where also\r\nthe wind was strong enough to blow the tops of the waves over, forming\r\nwhite-caps, the advance of the particle very near the surface would be\r\nspeedy. Notwithstanding these corrections, waves are to be regarded\r\neach as a store of energy, urging the water to sway much in the manner\r\nof a carpet strip, and by the swaying conveying the energy in the\r\ndirection of the wave movement.\r\n\r\nThe rate of movement of wind waves increases with their height.\r\nSlight undulations go forward at the rate of less than half a mile an\r\nhour. The greater surges of the deeps when swept by the strongest\r\nwinds move with the speed which, though not accurately determined, has\r\nbeen estimated by the present writer as exceeding forty miles an hour.\r\nAs these surges often have a length transverse to the wind of a mile\r\nor more, a width of about an eighth of a mile, and a height of from\r\nthirty-five to forty-five feet, the amount of energy which they\r\ntransmit is very great. If it could be effectively applied to the\r\nshores in the manner in which the energy of exploding gunpowder is\r\napplied by cannon shot, it is doubtful whether the lands could have\r\nmaintained their position against the assaults of the sea. But there\r\nare reasons stated below why the ocean waves can use only a very small\r\npart of their energy in rending the rocks against which they strike on\r\nthe coast line.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we should note that wind waves have very little\r\ninfluence on the bottom of the deep sea. If an observer could stand on\r\nthe sea floor at the depth of a mile below a point over which the\r\ngreatest waves were rolling, he could not with his unaided senses\r\ndiscern that the water was troubled. He would, indeed, require\r\ninstruments of some delicacy to find out that it moved at all. Making\r\nthe same observations at the depth of a thousand feet, it is possible\r\nthat he would note a slight swaying motion in the water, enough\r\nsensibly to affect his body. At five hundred feet in depth the\r\nmovement would probably be sufficient to disturb fine mud. At two\r\nhundred feet, the rasping of the surge on the bottom would doubtless\r\nbe sufficient to push particles of coarse sand to and fro. At one\r\nhundred feet in depth, the passage of the surge would be strong enough\r\nto urge considerable pebbles before it. Thence up the slope the\r\ndriving action would become more and more intense until we attained\r\nthe point where the wave broke. It should furthermore be noted that,\r\nwhile the movement of the water on the floor of the deep sea as the\r\nwave passes overhead would be to and fro, with every advance in the\r\nshallowing and consequent increased friction on the bottom, the\r\nforward element in the movement would rapidly increase. Near the coast\r\nline the effect of the waves is continually to shove the detritus up\r\nthe slopes of the continental shelf. Here we should note the fact that\r\non this shelf the waves play a part exactly the opposite of that\r\neffected by the tides. The tides, as we have noted, tend to drag the\r\nparticles down the slope, while the waves operate to roll them up the\r\ndeclivity.\r\n\r\nAs the wave in advancing toward the shore ordinarily comes into\r\ncontinually shallowing water, the friction on the bottom is\r\never-increasing, and serves to diminish the energy the surge contains,\r\nand therefore to reduce its proportions. If this action operated\r\nalone, the subtraction which the friction makes would cause the surf\r\nwaves which roll in over a continental shelf to be very low, probably\r\nin height less than half that which they now attain. In fact, however,\r\nthere is an influence at work to increase the height of the waves at\r\nthe expense of its width. Noting that the friction rapidly increases\r\nwith the shallowing, it is easy to see that this resistance is\r\ngreatest on the advancing front of the wave, and least on its seaward\r\nside. The result is that the front moves more slowly than the rear, so\r\nthat the wave is forced to gain in height; but for the fact that the\r\ntotal friction which the wave encounters takes away most of its\r\nimpetus, we might have combers a hundred feet high rolling upon the\r\nshelving shores which almost everywhere face the seas.\r\n\r\nAs the wave shortens its width and gains in relative height, though\r\nnot in actual elevation, another action is introduced which has\r\nmomentous consequences. The water in the bottom of the wave is greatly\r\nretarded in its ongoing by its friction over the sea floor, while the\r\nupper part of the surge is much less affected in this way. The result\r\nis that at a certain point in the advance, the place of which is\r\ndetermined by the depth, the size, and the speed of the undulation,\r\nthe front swiftly steepens until it is vertical, and the top shoots\r\nforward to a point where it is no longer supported by underlying\r\nwater, when it plunges down in what is called the surf or breaker. In\r\nthis part of the wave's work the application of the energy which it\r\ntransmits differs strikingly from the work previously done. Before the\r\nwave breaks, the only geological task which it accomplishes is\r\neffected by forcing materials up the slope, in which movement they are\r\nslightly ground over each other until they come within the battering\r\nzone of the shore, where they may be further divided by the action of\r\nthe mill which is there in operation.\r\n\r\nWhen the wave breaks on the shore it operates in the following manner:\r\nFirst, the overturning of its crest sends a great mass of water, it\r\nmay be from the height of ten or more feet, down upon the shore. Thus\r\nfalling water has not only the force due to its drop from the summit\r\nof the wave, but it has a share of the impulse due to the velocity\r\nwith which the surge moved against the shore. It acts, in a word, like\r\na hammer swung down by a strong arm, where the blow represents not\r\nonly the force with which the weight would fall of itself, but the\r\nimpelling power of the man's muscles. Any one who will expose his body\r\nto this blow of the surf will recognise how violent it is; he may, if\r\nthe beach be pebbly, note how it drives the stones about; fragments\r\nthe size of a man's head may be hurled by the stroke to the distance\r\nof twenty feet or more; those as large as the fist may be thrown clear\r\nbeyond the limits of the wave. So vigorous is this stroke that the\r\nsound of it may sometimes be heard ten miles inland from the coast\r\nwhere it is delivered.\r\n\r\nMoving forward up the slope of a gently inclined beach, the fragments\r\nof the wave are likely to be of sufficient volume to permit them to\r\nregather into a secondary surge, which, like the first, though much\r\nsmaller, again rises into a wall, forming another breaker. Under\r\nfavourable conditions as many as four or five of these successive\r\ndiminishing surf lines may be seen. The present writer has seen in\r\ncertain cases as many as a dozen in the great procession, the lowest\r\nand innermost only a few inches high, the outer of all with a height\r\nof perhaps twenty feet.\r\n\r\nAlong with the direct bearing action of the surf goes a to-and-fro\r\nmovement, due to the rushing up and down of the water on the beach.\r\nThis swashing affects not only the broken part of the waves, but all\r\nthe water between the outer breaker and the shore. These swayings in\r\nthe surf belt often swing the _débris_ on the inner margin over a\r\nrange of a hundred feet or more, the movement taking place with great\r\nswiftness, affecting the pebbles to the depth of several inches, and\r\ngrinding the bits together in a violent way. Listening to the turmoil\r\nof a storm, we can on a pebbly beach distinctly hear the sound of the\r\ndownward stroke, a crashing tone, and the roar of the rolling stones.\r\n\r\nAs waves are among the interesting things in the world, partly on\r\naccount of their living quality and partly because of their immediate\r\nand often exceeding interest to man, we may here note one or two\r\npeculiar features in their action. In the first place, as the reader\r\nwho has gained a sense of the changes in form of action may readily\r\nperceive, the beating of waves on the shore converts the energy which\r\nthey possess into heat. This probably warms the water during great\r\nstorms, so that by the hand we may note the difference in temperature\r\nnext the coast line and in the open waters. This relative warmth of\r\nthe surf water is perhaps a matter of some importance in limiting the\r\ndevelopment of ice along the shore line; it may also favour the\r\nprotection of the coast life against the severe cold of the winter\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe waves which successively come against the shore in any given time,\r\nparticularly if a violent wind is blowing on to the coast, are usually\r\nof about the same size. When, however, in times of calm an old sea, as\r\nit is called, is rolling in, the surges may occasionally undergo very\r\ngreat variations in magnitude. Not infrequently these occasional waves\r\nare great enough to overwhelm persons who are upon the rocks next the\r\nshore. These greater surges are probably to be accounted for by the\r\nfact that in the open sea waves produced by winds blowing in different\r\ndirections may run on with their diverse courses and varied intervals\r\nuntil they come near the shore. Running in together, it very well\r\nhappens that two of the surges belonging to different sets may combine\r\ntheir forces, thus doubling the swell. The danger which these\r\nconjoined waves bring is obviously greatest on cliff shores, where, on\r\naccount of the depth of water, the waves do not break until they\r\nstrike the steep.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving considered in a general way the action of waves as they roll in\r\nto the shore, bearing with them the solar energy which was contributed\r\nto them by the winds, we shall now take up in some detail the work\r\nwhich goes on along the coast line--work which is mainly accomplished\r\nby wave action.\r\n\r\nOn most coast lines the observer readily notes that the shore is\r\ndivided into two different kinds of faces--those where the inner\r\nmargin of the wave-swept belt comes against rocky steeps, and those\r\nbordered by a strand altogether composed of materials which the surges\r\nhave thrown up. These may be termed for convenience cliff shores and\r\nwall-beach shores. We shall begin our inquiry with cliff shores, for\r\nin those sections of the coast line the sea is doing its most\r\ncharacteristic and important work of assaulting the land. If the\r\nstudent has an opportunity to approach a set of cliffs of hard rock in\r\ntime of heavy storm, when the waves have somewhere their maximum\r\nheight, he should seek some headland which may offer him safe foothold\r\nwhence he can behold the movements which are taking place. If he is so\r\nfortunate as to have in view, as well may be the case, cliffs which\r\nextend down into deep water, and others which are bordered by rude\r\nand generally steeply sloping beaches covered with large stones, he\r\nmay perceive that the waves come in against the cliffs which plunge\r\ninto deep water without taking on the breaker form. In this case the\r\nundulation strikes but a moderate blow; the wave is not greatly\r\nbroken. The part next the rock may shoot up as a thin sheet to a\r\nconsiderable height; it is evident that while the ongoing wave applies\r\na good deal of pressure to the steep, it does not deliver its energy\r\nin the effective form of a blow as when the wave overturns, or in the\r\nconsequent rush of the water up a beach slope. It is easy to perceive\r\nthat firm-set rock cliffs, with no beaches at their bases, can almost\r\nindefinitely withstand the assaults. On the steep and stony beach,\r\nbecause of its relatively great declivity, the breaker or surf forms\r\nfar in, and even in its first plunge often attains the base of the\r\nprecipice. The blow of the overfalling as well as that of the inrush\r\nmoves about stones of great size; those three feet or more in diameter\r\nare often hurled by the action against the base of the steep, striking\r\nblows, the sharp note of which can often be heard above the general\r\nroar which the commotion produces. The needlelike crags forming isles\r\nstanding at a distance from the shore, such as are often found along\r\nhard rock coasts, are singularly protected from the action of\r\neffective waves. The surges which strike against them are unarmed with\r\nstones, and the water at their bases is so deep that it does not sway\r\nwith the motion with sufficient energy to move them on the bottom.\r\nWhere a cliff is in this condition, it may endure until an elevation\r\nof the coast line brings its base near the level of the sea, or until\r\nthe process of decay has detached a sufficient quantity of stone to\r\nform a talus or inclined plane reaching near to the water level.\r\n\r\nAs before noted, it is the presence of a sloping beach reaching to\r\nabout the base of the cliff which makes it possible for the waves to\r\nstrike at with a hammer instead of with a soft hand. Battering at the\r\nbase of the cliff, the surges cut a crease along the strip on which\r\nthey strike, which gradually enters so far that the overhanging rock\r\nfalls of its own weight. The fragments thus delivered to the sea are\r\nin turn broken up and used as battering instruments until they are\r\nworn to pieces. We may note that in a few months of heavy weather the\r\nstones of such a fall have all been reduced to rudely spherical forms.\r\nObservations made on the eastern face of Cape Ann, Mass., where the\r\nseas are only moderately heavy, show that the storms of a single\r\nwinter reduce the fragments thrown into the sea from the granite\r\nquarries to spheroidal shapes, more than half of their weight commonly\r\nbeing removed in the form of sand and small pebbles which have been\r\nworn from their surfaces.\r\n\r\nWe can best perceive the effect of battering action which the sea\r\napplies to the cliffs by noting the points where, owing to some chance\r\nfeatures in the structure in the rock, it has proved most effective.\r\nWhere a joint or a dike, or perhaps a softer layer, if the rocks be\r\nbedded, causes the wear to go on more rapidly, the waves soon excavate\r\na recess in which the pebbles are retained, except in stormy weather,\r\nin an unmoved condition. When the surges are heavy, these stones are\r\nkept in continuous motion, receding as the wave goes back, and rushing\r\nforward with its impulse until they strike against the firm-set rock\r\nat the end of the chasm. In this way they may drive in a cut having\r\nthe length of a hundred feet or more from the face of the precipice.\r\nIn most cases the roofs over these sea caves fall in, so that the\r\nstructure is known as a chasm. Occasionally these roofs remain, in\r\nwhich case, for the reason that the floor of the cutting inclines\r\nupward, an opening is made to the surface at their upper end, forming\r\nwhat is called in New England a \"spouting horn\"; from the inland end\r\nof the tunnel the spray may be thrown far into the air. As long as the\r\ncave is closed at this inner end, and is not so high but that it may\r\nbe buried beneath a heavy wave, the inrushing water compresses the\r\nair in the rear parts of the opening. When the wave begins to retreat\r\nthis air blows out, sending a gust of spray before it, the action\r\nresembling the discharge of a great gun from the face of a\r\nfortification. It often happens that two chasms converging separate a\r\nrock from the cliff. Then a lowering of the coast may bring the mass\r\nto the state of a columnar island, such as abound in the Hebrides and\r\nalong various other shores.\r\n\r\nIf a cliff shore retreats rapidly, it may be driven back into the\r\nshore, and its face assumes the curve of a small bay. With every step\r\nin this change the bottom is sure to become shallower, so that the\r\nwaves lose more and more of their energy in friction over the bottom.\r\nMoreover, in entering a bay the friction which the waves encounter in\r\nrunning along the sides is greater than that which they meet in\r\ncoming in upon a headland or a straight shore. The result is, with the\r\ninward retreat of the steep it enters on conditions which diminish the\r\neffectiveness of the wave stroke. The embayment also is apt to hold\r\ndetritus, and so forms in time a beach at the foot of the cliff, over\r\nwhich the waves rarely are able to mount with such energy as will\r\nenable them to strike the wall in an effective manner. With this\r\nsketch of the conditions of a cliff shore, we will now consider the\r\nfate of the broken-tip rock which the waves have produced on that\r\nsection of the coast land.\r\n\r\nBy observation of sea-beaten cliffs the student readily perceives that\r\na great amount of rocky matter has been removed from most cliff-faced\r\nshores. Not uncommonly it can be shown that such sea faces have\r\nretreated for several miles. The question now arises, What becomes of\r\nthe matter which has been broken up by the wave action? In some part\r\nthe rock, when pulverized by the pounding to which it is subjected,\r\nhas dissolved in the water. Probably ninety per cent of it, however,\r\nretains the visible state, and has a fate determined by the size of\r\nthe fragments of which it is composed. If these be as fine as mud, so\r\nthat they may float in the water, they are readily borne away by the\r\ncurrents which are always created along a storm-swept shore,\r\nparticularly by the undertow or bottom outcurrent--the \"sea-puss,\" as\r\nit is sometimes called--that sweeps along the bottom from every shore,\r\nagainst which the waves form a surf. If as coarse as sand grains, or\r\neven very small pebbles, they are likely to be drawn out, rolling over\r\nthe bottom to an indefinite distance from the sea margin. The coarser\r\nstones, however, either remain at the foot of the cliff until they are\r\nbeaten to pieces, or are driven along the shore until they find some\r\nembayment into which they enter. The journey of such fragments may,\r\nwhen the wind strikes obliquely to the shore, continue for many miles;\r\nthe waves, running with the wind, drive the fragments in oscillating\r\njourneys up and down the beach, sometimes at the rate of a mile or\r\nmore a day. The effect of this action can often be seen where a vessel\r\nloaded with brick or coal is wrecked on the coast. In a month\r\nfragments of the materials may be stretched along for the distance of\r\nmany miles on either side of the point where the cargo came ashore.\r\nEntering an embayment deep enough to restrain their further journey,\r\nthe fragments of rock form a boulder beach, where the bits roll to and\r\nfro whenever they are struck by heavy surges. The greater portion of\r\nthem remain in this mill until they are ground to the state of sand\r\nand mud. Now and then one of the fragments is tossed up beyond the\r\nreach of the waves, and is contributed to the wall of the beach. In\r\nvery heavy storms these pebbles which are thrown inland may amount in\r\nweight to many tons for each mile of shore.\r\n\r\nThe study of a pebbly beach, drawn from crest to the deep water\r\noutside, will give an idea as to the history of its work. On either\r\nhorn of the crescent by which the pebbles are imported into the pocket\r\nwe find the largest fragments. If the shore of the bay be long, the\r\ninnermost part of the recess may show even only very small pebbles, or\r\nperhaps only fine sand, the coarser material having been worn out in\r\nthe journey. On the bottom of the bay, near low tide, we begin to find\r\nsome sand produced by the grinding action. Yet farther out, below\r\nhigh-tide mark, there is commonly a layer of mud which represents the\r\nfiner products of the mill.\r\n\r\nBoulder beaches are so quick in answering to every slight change in\r\nthe conditions which affect them that they seem almost alive. If by\r\nany chance the supply of detritus is increased, they fill in between\r\nthe horns, diminish the incurve of the bay, and so cause its beach to\r\nbe more exposed to heavy waves. If, on the other hand, the supply of\r\ngrist to the mill is diminished, the beach becomes more deeply\r\nincurved, and the wave action is proportionately reduced. We may say,\r\nin general, that the curve of these beaches represents a balance\r\nbetween the consumption and supply of the pebbles which they grind up.\r\nThe supply of pebbles brought along the shore by the waves is in many\r\ncases greatly added to by a curious action of seaweeds. If the bottom\r\nof the water off the coast is covered by these fragments, as is the\r\ncase along many coast lines within the old glaciated districts, the\r\nspores of algæ are prone to take root upon them. Fastening themselves\r\nin those positions, and growing upward, the seaweeds may attain\r\nconsiderable size. Being provided with floats, the plant exercises a\r\ncertain lifting power on the stone, and finally the tugging action of\r\nthe waves on the fronds may detach the fragments from the bottom,\r\nmaking them free to journey toward the shore. Observing from near at\r\nhand the straight wall of the wave in times of heavy storm, the\r\npresent writer has seen in one view as many as a dozen of these\r\nplant-borne stones, sometimes six inches in diameter, hanging in the\r\nwalls of water as it was about to topple over. As soon as they strike\r\nthe wave-beaten part of the shore these stones are apt to become\r\nseparated from the plants, though we can often notice the remains or\r\nprints of the attachments adhering to the surface of the rock. Where\r\nthe pebbles off the shore are plenty, a rocky beach may be produced\r\nby this process of importation through the agency of seaweeds without\r\nany supply being brought by the waves along the coast line.\r\n\r\nReturning to sand beaches, we enter the most interesting field of\r\ncontact between seas and lands. Probably nine tenths of all the coast\r\nlines of the open ocean are formed of arenaceous material. In general,\r\nsand consists of finely broken crystals of silica or quartz. These\r\nbits are commonly distinctly faceted; they rarely have a spherical\r\nform. Not only do accumulations of sand border most of the shore line,\r\nbut they protect the land against the assaults of the sea, and this in\r\nthe following curious manner: When shore waves beat pebbles against\r\neach other, they rapidly wear to bits; we can hear the sound of the\r\nwearing action as the wave goes to and fro. We can often see that the\r\nwater is discoloured by the mud or powdered rock. When, however, the\r\nwaves tumble on a sandy coast, they make but a muffled sound, and\r\nproduce no mud. In fact, the particles of sand do not touch each other\r\nwhen they receive the blow. Between them there lies a thin film of\r\nwater, drawn in by the attraction known as capillarity, which sucks\r\nthe fluid into a sponge or between plates of glass placed near\r\ntogether. The stroke of the waves slightly compresses this capillary\r\nwater, but the faces of the grains are kept apart as sheets of glass\r\nmay be observed to be restrained from contact when water is between\r\nthem. If the reader would convince himself as to the condition of the\r\nsand grains and the water which is between them, he may do so by\r\npressing his foot on the wet beach which the wave has just left. He\r\nwill observe that it whitens and sinks a little under the pressure,\r\nbut returns in good part to its original form when the foot is lifted.\r\nIn the experiment he has pushed a part of the contained water aside,\r\nbut he has not brought the grains together; they do not make the sound\r\nwhich he will often hear when the sand is dry. The result is that the\r\nsand on the seashore may wear more in going the distance of a mile in\r\nthe dry sand dune than in travelling for hundreds along the wet shore.\r\n\r\nIf the rock matter in the state of sand wore as rapidly under the\r\nheating of the waves as it does in the state of pebbles, the\r\ncontinents would doubtless be much smaller than they are. Those coasts\r\nwhich have no other protection than is afforded by a low sand beach\r\nare often better guarded against the inroads of the sea than the\r\nrock-girt parts of the continents. It is on account of this remarkable\r\nendurance of sand of the action of the waves that the stratified rocks\r\nwhich make up the crust of the earth are so thick and are to such an\r\nextent composed of sand grains.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the _débris_-making influences along the coast line is\r\nto fill in the irregularities which normally exist there; to batter\r\noff the headlands, close up the bays and harbours, and generally to\r\nreduce the shores to straight lines. Where the tide has access to\r\nthese inlets, it is constantly at work in dragging out the detritus\r\nwhich the waves make and thrust into the recesses. These two actions\r\ncontend with each other, and determine the conditions of the coast\r\nline, whether they afford ports for commerce or are sealed in by sand\r\nbars, as are many coast lines which are not tide-swept, as that of\r\nnorthern Africa, which faces the Mediterranean, a nearly tideless sea.\r\nThe same is the case with the fresh-water lakes; even the greater of\r\nthem are often singularly destitute of shelters which can serve the\r\nuse of ships, and this because there are no tides to keep the bays and\r\nharbours open.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE OCEAN CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nThe system of ocean currents, though it exhibits much complication in\r\ndetail, is in the main and primarily dependent on the action of the\r\nconstant air streams known as the trade winds. With the breath from\r\nthe lips over a basin of water we can readily make an experiment which\r\nshows in a general way the method in which the winds operate in\r\nproducing the circulation of the sea. Blowing upon the surface of the\r\nwater in the basin, we find that even this slight impulse at once sets\r\nthe upper part in motion, the movement being of two kinds--pulsating\r\nmovements or waves are produced, and at the same time the friction of\r\nthe air on the surface causes its upper part to slide over the under.\r\nWith little floats we can shortly note that the stream which forms\r\npasses to the farther side of the vessel, there divides, and returns\r\nto the point of beginning, forming a double circle, or rather two\r\nellipses, the longer sides of which are parallel with the line of the\r\nair current. Watching more closely, aiding the sight by the particles\r\nwhich float at various distances below the surface, we note the fact\r\nthat the motion which was at first imparted to the surface gradually\r\nextends downward until it affects the water to the depth of some\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nIn the trade-wind belt the ocean waters to the depth of some hundreds\r\nof feet acquire a continuous movement in the direction in which they\r\nare impelled by those winds. This motion is most rapid at the surface\r\nand near the tropics. It diminishes downwardly in the water, and also\r\ntoward the polar sides of the trade-wind districts. Thus the trades\r\nproduce in the sea two broad, slow-moving, deep currents, flowing in\r\nthe northern hemisphere toward the southwest, and in the southern\r\nhemisphere toward the northwest. Coming down upon each other\r\nobliquely, these broad streams meet about the middle of the tropical\r\nbelt. Here, as before noted, the air of the trade winds leaves the\r\nsurface and rises upward. The waters being retained on their level,\r\nform a current which moves toward the west. If the earth within the\r\ntropics were covered by a universal sea, the result of this movement\r\nwould be the institution of a current which, flowing under the\r\nequator, would girdle the sphere.\r\n\r\nWith a girdling equatorial current, because of the intense heat of the\r\ntropics and the extreme cold of the parallels beyond the fortieth\r\ndegree of latitude, the earth would be essentially uninhabitable to\r\nman, and hardly so to any forms of life. Its surface would be visited\r\nby fierce winds induced by the very great differences of temperature\r\nwhich would then prevail. Owing, however, to the barriers which the\r\ncontinents interpose to the motions of these windward-setting tropical\r\ncurrents, all the water which they bear, when it strikes the opposing\r\nshores, is diverted to the right and left, as was the stream in the\r\nexperiment with the basin and the breath, the divided currents seeking\r\nways toward high latitudes, conveying their store of heat to the\r\ncircumpolar lands. So effective is this transfer of temperature that a\r\nvery large part of the heat which enters the waters in the tropical\r\nregion is taken out of that division of the earth's surface and\r\ndistributed over the realms of sea and land which lie beyond the\r\nlimits of the vertical sun. Thus the Gulf Stream, the northern branch\r\nof the Atlantic tropical current, by flowing into the North Atlantic,\r\ncontributes to the temperature of the region within the Arctic Circle\r\nmore heat than actually comes to that district by the direct influx\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThe above statements as to the climatal effect of the ocean streams\r\nshow us how important it is to obtain a sufficient conception as to\r\nthe way in which these currents now move and what we can of their\r\nhistory during the geologic ages. This task can not yet be adequately\r\ndone. The fields of the sea are yet too imperfectly explored to afford\r\nus all the facts required to make out the whole story. Only in the\r\ncase of our Gulf Stream can we form a full conception as to the\r\njourney which the waters undergo and the consequence of their motion.\r\nIn the case of this current, observations clearly show that it arises\r\nfrom the junction near the equatorial line of the broad stream created\r\nby the two trade-wind belts. Uniting at the equator, these produce a\r\nwesterly setting current, having the width of some hundred miles and a\r\ndepth of several hundred feet. Its velocity is somewhat greater than a\r\nmile an hour. The centre of the current, because of the greater\r\nstrength of the northern as compared with the southern trades, is\r\nconsiderably south of the equator. When this great slow-moving stream\r\ncomes against the coast of South America, it encounters the projecting\r\nshoulder of that land which terminates at Cape St. Roque. There it\r\ndivides, as does a current on the bows of an anchored ship, a\r\npart--rather more than one half--of the stream turning to the\r\nnorthward, the remainder passing toward the southern pole; this\r\nnortherly portion becomes what is afterward known as the Gulf Stream,\r\nthe history of which we shall now briefly follow.\r\n\r\nFlowing by the northwesterly coast of South America, the northern\r\nshare of the tropical current, being pressed in against the land by\r\nthe trade winds, is narrowed, and therefore acquires at once a swifter\r\nflow, the increased speed being due to conditions like those which add\r\nto the velocity of the water flowing through a hose when it comes to\r\nthe constriction of the nozzle. Attaining the line of the southeastern\r\nor Lesser Antilles, often known as the Windward Islands, a part of\r\nthis current slips through the interspaces between these isles and\r\nenters the Gulf of Mexico. Another portion, failing to find sufficient\r\nroom through these passages, skirts the Antilles on their eastern and\r\nnorthern sides, passes by and among the Bahama Islands, there to\r\nrejoin the part of the stream which entered the Caribbean. This\r\nCaribbean portion of the tide spreads widely in that broad sea, is\r\nconstricted again between Cuba and Yucatan, again expands in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, and is finally poured forth through the Straits of Florida\r\nas a stream having the width of forty or fifty miles, a depth of a\r\nthousand feet or more, and a speed of from three to five miles an\r\nhour, exceeding in its rate of flow the average of the greatest\r\nrivers, and conveying more water than do all the land streams of the\r\nearth. In this part of its course the deep and swift stream from the\r\nGulf of Mexico, afterward to be named the Gulf Stream, receives the\r\ncontribution of slower moving and shallower currents which skirted the\r\nAntilles on their eastern verge. The conjoined waters then move\r\nnorthward, veering toward the east, at first as a swift river of the\r\nsea having a width of less than a hundred miles and of great depth;\r\nwith each step toward the pole this stream widens, diminishing\r\nproportionately in depth; the speed of its current decreases as the\r\noriginal impetus is lost, and the baffling winds set its surface\r\nwaters to and fro in an irregular way. Where it passes Cape Hatteras\r\nit has already lost a large share of its momentum and much of its\r\nheat, and is greatly widened.\r\n\r\nAlthough the current of the Gulf Stream becomes more languid as we go\r\nnorthward, it for a very long time retains its distinction from the\r\nwaters of the sea through which it flows. Sailing eastward from the\r\nmouth of the Chesapeake, the navigator can often observe the moment\r\nwhen he enters the waters of this current. This is notable not only in\r\nthe temperature, but in the hue of the sea. North of that line the\r\nsharpness of the parting wall becomes less distinct, the stream\r\nspreads out broadly over the surface of the Atlantic, yet its\r\nthermometric effects are distinctly traceable to Iceland and Nova\r\nZembla, and the tropical driftwood which it carries affords the\r\nprincipal timber supply of the inhabitants of the first-named isle.\r\nAttaining this circumpolar realm, and finally losing the impulse which\r\nbore it on, the water of the Gulf Stream partly returns to the\r\nsouthward in a relatively slight current which bears the fluid along\r\nthe coast of Europe until it re-enters the system of tropical winds\r\nand the currents which they produce. A larger portion stagnates in the\r\ncircumpolar region, in time slowly to return to the tropical district\r\nin a manner afterward to be described. Although the Gulf Stream in the\r\nregion north of Cape Hatteras is so indistinct that its presence was\r\nnot distinctly recognised until the facts were subjected to the keen\r\neye of Benjamin Franklin, its effects in the way of climate are so\r\ngreat that we must attribute the fitness of northern Europe for the\r\nuses of civilized man to its action. But for the heat which this\r\nstream brings to the realm of the North Atlantic, Great Britain would\r\nbe as sterile as Labrador, and the Scandinavian region, the\r\ncradle-land of our race, as uninhabitable as the bleakest parts of\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that when the equatorial current divides on\r\nthe continents against which it flows, the separate streams, although\r\nthey may follow the shores for a certain distance toward the poles,\r\nsoon diverge from them, just as the Gulf Stream passes to the seaward\r\nfrom the eastern coast of the United States. The reason for this\r\nmovement is readily found in the same principle which explains the\r\noblique flow of the trades and counter trades in their passage to and\r\nfrom the equatorial belt. The particle of water under the equator,\r\nthough it flows to the west, has, by virtue of the earth's rotation,\r\nan eastward-setting velocity of a thousand miles an hour. Starting\r\ntoward the poles, the particle is ever coming into regions of the sea\r\nwhere the fluid has a less easterly movement, due to the earth's\r\nrotation on its axis. Consequently the journeying water by its\r\nmomentum tends to move off in an easterly course. Attaining high\r\nlatitudes and losing its momentum, it abides in the realm long enough\r\nto become cooled.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that only a portion of the waters sent\r\nnorthward in the Gulf Stream and the other currents which flow from\r\nthe equator to the poles is returned by the surface flow which sets\r\ntoward the equator along the eastern side of the basins. The largest\r\nshare of the tide effects its return journey in other ways. Some\r\nportion of this remainder sets equatorward in local cold streams, such\r\nas that which pours forth through Davis Strait into Baffin Bay,\r\nflowing under the Gulf Stream waters for an unknown distance toward\r\nthe tropics. There are several of these local as yet little known\r\nstreams, which doubtless bring about a certain amount of circulation\r\nbetween the polar regions and the tropical districts. Their effect is,\r\nhowever, probably small as compared with that massive drift which we\r\nhave now to note.\r\n\r\nThe tropical waters when they attain high latitudes are constantly\r\ncooled, and are overlaid by the warmer contributions of that tide, and\r\nare thus brought lower and lower in the sea. When they start downward\r\nthey have, as observations show, a temperature not much above the\r\nfreezing point of salt water. They do not congeal for the reason that\r\nthe salt of the ocean lowers the point at which the water solidifies\r\nto near 28° Fahr. The effect of this action is gradually to press down\r\nthe surface cold water until it attains the very bottom in all the\r\ncircumpolar regions. At the same time this descending water drifts\r\nalong the bottom of the ocean troughs toward the equatorial realm. As\r\nthis cold water is heavier than that which is of higher temperature\r\nand nearer the surface, it has no tendency to rise. Being below the\r\ndisturbing influences of any current save its own, it does not tend,\r\nexcept in a very small measure, to mingle with the warmer overlying\r\nfluid. The result is that it continues its journey until it may come\r\nwithin the tropics without having gained a temperature of more than\r\n35° Fahr., the increase in heat being due in small measure to that\r\nwhich it receives from the earth's interior and that which it acquires\r\nfrom the overlying warmer water. Attaining the region of the tropical\r\ncurrent, this drift water from the poles gradually rises, to take the\r\nplace of that which goes poleward, becomes warm, and again starts on\r\nits surface journey toward the arctic and antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nNothing is known as to the rate of this bottom drift from the polar\r\ndistricts toward the equator, but, from some computation which he has\r\nmade, the writer is of the opinion that several centuries is doubtless\r\nrequired for the journey from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. The\r\nspeed of the movement probably varies; it may at times require some\r\nthousand years for its accomplishment. The effect of the bottom drift\r\nis to withdraw from seas in high latitudes the very cold water which\r\nthere forms, and to convey it beneath the seas of middle latitudes to\r\na realm where it is well placed for the reheating process. If all the\r\ncold water of circumpolar regions had to journey over the surface to\r\nthe equator, the perturbing effect of its flow on the climates of\r\nvarious lands would be far greater than it is at present. Where such\r\ncold currents exist the effect is to chill the air without adding much\r\nto the rainfall; while the currents setting northward not only warm\r\nthe regions near which they flow, but by so doing send from the water\r\nsurfaces large quantities of moisture which fall as snow or rain. Thus\r\nthe Gulf Stream, directly and indirectly, probably contributes more\r\nthan half the rainfall about the Atlantic basin. The lack of this\r\ninfluence on the northern part of North America and Asia causes those\r\nlands to be sterilized by cold, although destitute of permanent ice\r\nand snow upon their surfaces.\r\n\r\nWe readily perceive that the effect of the oceanic circulation upon\r\nthe temperatures of different regions is not only great but widely\r\ncontrasted. By taking from the equatorial belt a large part of the\r\nheat which falls within that realm, it lowers the temperature to the\r\npoint which makes the district fit for the occupancy of man, perhaps,\r\nindeed, tenable to all the higher forms of life. This same heat\r\nremoved to high latitudes tempers the winter's cold, and thus makes a\r\nvast realm inhabitable which otherwise would be locked in almost\r\nenduring frosts. Furthermore, this distribution of temperatures tends\r\nto reduce the total wind energy by diminishing the trades and counter\r\ntrades which are due to the variations of heat which are encountered\r\nin passing polarward from the equator. Still further, but for this\r\ncirculation of water in the sea, the oceans about the poles would be\r\nfrozen to their very bottom, and this vast sheet of ice might be\r\nextended southward to within the parallels of fifty degrees north and\r\nsouth latitude, although the waters under the equator might at the\r\nsame time be unendurably hot and unfit for the occupancy of living\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nA large part of the difficulties which geologists encounter in\r\nendeavouring to account for the changes of the past arise from the\r\nevidences of great climatal revolutions which the earth has undergone.\r\nIn some chapters of the great stone book, whose leaves are the strata\r\nof the earth, we find it plainly written in the impressions made by\r\nfossils that all the lands beyond the equatorial belt have undergone\r\nchanges which can only be explained by the supposition that the heat\r\nand moisture of the countries have been subjected to sudden and\r\nremarkable changes. Thus in relatively recent times thick-leaved\r\nplants which retained their vegetation in a rather tender state\r\nthroughout the year have flourished near to the poles, while shortly\r\nafterward an ice sheet, such as now covers the greater part of\r\nGreenland, extended down to the line of the Ohio River at Cincinnati.\r\nAlthough these changes of climate are, as we shall hereafter note,\r\nprobably due to entangled causes, we must look upon the modifications\r\nof the ocean streams as one of the most important elements in the\r\ncausation. We can the more readily imagine such changes to be due to\r\nthe alterations in the course and volume of the ocean current when we\r\nnote how trifling peculiarities in the geography of the\r\nshores--features which are likely to be altered by the endless changes\r\nwhich occur in the form of a continent--affect the run of these\r\ncurrents. Thus the growth of coral reefs in southern Florida, and, in\r\ngeneral, the formation of that peninsula, by narrowing the exit of the\r\ngreat current from the Gulf of Mexico, has probably increased its\r\nvelocity. If Florida should again sink down, that current would go\r\nforth into the North Atlantic with the speed of about a mile an hour,\r\nand would not have momentum enough to carry its waters over half the\r\nvast region which they now traverse. If the lands about the western\r\nborder of the Caribbean Sea, particularly the Isthmus of Darien,\r\nshould be depressed to a considerable depth below the ocean level,\r\nthe tropical current would enter the Pacific Ocean, adding to the\r\ntemperature of its waters all the precious heat which now vitalizes\r\nthe North Atlantic region. Such a geographic accident would not only\r\nprofoundly alter the life conditions of that part of the world, but it\r\nwould make an end of European civilization.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on climatal changes further attention will be given to\r\nthe action of ocean currents from the point of view of their influence\r\non the heat and moisture of different parts of the world. We now have\r\nto consider the last important influence of ocean currents--that which\r\nthey directly exercise on the development of organic life. The most\r\nstriking effect of this nature which the sea streams bring about is\r\ncaused by the ceaseless transportation to which they subject the eggs\r\nand seeds of animals and plants, as well as the bodies of the mature\r\nform which are moved about by the flowing waters. But for the\r\nexistence of these north and south flowing currents, due to the\r\npresence of the continental barriers, the living tenants of the seas\r\nwould be borne along around the earth, always in the same latitude,\r\nand therefore exposed to the same conditions of temperature. In this\r\nstate of affairs the influences which now make for change in organic\r\nspecies would be far less than they are. Journeying in the great\r\nwhirlpools which the continental barriers make out of the westward\r\nsetting tropical currents, these organic species are ever being\r\nexposed to alterations in their temperature conditions which we know\r\nto be favourable to the creation of those variations on which the\r\nadvance of organic life so intimately depends. Thus the ocean currents\r\nnot only help to vary the earth by producing changes in the climate of\r\nboth sea and land, breaking up the uniformity which would otherwise\r\ncharacterize regions at the same distance from the equator, but they\r\ninduce, by the consequences of the migrations which they enforce,\r\nchanges in the organic tenants of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother immediate effect of ocean streams arises where their currents\r\nof warm water come against shores or shallows of the sea. At these\r\npoints, if the water have a tropical temperature, we invariably find a\r\nvast and rapid development of marine animals and plants, of which the\r\ncoral-making polyps are the most important. In such positions the\r\ngrowth of forms which secrete solid skeletons is so rapid that great\r\nwalls of their remains accumulate next the shore, the mass being built\r\noutwardly by successive growths until the realm of the land may be\r\nextended for scores of miles into the deep. In other cases vast mounds\r\nof this organic _débris_ may be accumulated in mid ocean until its\r\nsurface is interspersed with myriads of islands, all of which mark the\r\nwork due to the combined action of currents and the marine life which\r\nthey nourish. Probably more than four fifths of all the islands in the\r\ntropical belt are due in this way to the life-sustaining action of the\r\ncurrents which the trade winds create.\r\n\r\nThere are many secondary influences of a less important nature which\r\nare due to the ocean streams. The reader will find on most wall-maps\r\nof the world certain areas in the central part of the oceans which are\r\nnoted as Sargassum seas, of which that of the North Atlantic, west and\r\nsouth of the Azore Islands, is one of the most conspicuous. In these\r\ntracts, which in extent may almost be compared with the continents, we\r\nfind great quantities of floating seaweed, the entangled fronds of\r\nwhich often form a mass sufficiently dense to slightly restrain the\r\nspeed of ships. When the men on the caravels of Columbus entered this\r\ntangle, they were alarmed lest they should be unable to escape from\r\nits toils. It is a curious fact that these weeds of the sea while\r\nfloating do not reproduce by spores the structures which answer to the\r\nseeds of higher plants, but grow only by budding. It seems certain\r\nthat they could not maintain their place in the ocean but for the\r\naction of the currents which convey the bits rent off from the shores\r\nwhere the plant is truly at home. This vast growth of plant life in\r\nthe Sargassum basins doubtless contributed considerable and important\r\ndeposits of sediment to the sea floors beneath the waters which it\r\ninhabits. Certain ancient strata, known as the Devonian black shale,\r\noccupying the Ohio valley and the neighbouring parts of North America\r\nto the east and north of that basin, appear to be accumulations which\r\nwere made beneath an ancient Sargassum sea.\r\n\r\nThe ocean currents have greatly favoured and in many instances\r\ndetermined the migrations not only of marine forms, but of land\r\ncreatures as well. Floating timber may bear the eggs and seeds of many\r\nforms of life to great distances until the rafts are cast ashore in a\r\nrealm where, if the conditions favour, the creatures may find a new\r\nseat for their life. Seeds of plants incased in their often dense\r\nenvelopes may, because they float, be independently carried great\r\ndistances. So it comes about that no sooner does a coral or other\r\nisland rise above the waters of the sea than it becomes occupied by a\r\nvaried array of plants. The migrations of people, even down to the\r\ntime of the voyages which discovered America, have in large measure\r\nbeen controlled by the run of the ocean streams. The tropical set of\r\nthe waters to the westward helped Columbus on his way, and enabled him\r\nto make a journey which but for their assistance could hardly have\r\nbeen accomplished. This same current in the northern part of the Gulf\r\nStream opposed the passage of ships from northern Europe to the\r\nwestward, and to this day affects the speed with which their voyages\r\nare made.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CIRCUIT OF THE RAIN.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider those movements of the water which depend upon\r\nthe fact that at ordinary temperatures the sea yields to the air a\r\ncontinued and large supply of vapour, a contribution which is made in\r\nlessened proportion by water in all stages of coldness, and even by\r\nice when it is exposed to dry air. This evaporation of the sea water\r\nis proportional to the temperature and to the dryness of the air where\r\nit rests upon the ocean. It probably amounts on the average to\r\nsomewhere about three feet per annum; in regions favourably situated\r\nfor the process, as on the west coast of northern Africa, it may be\r\nthree or four times as much, while in the cold and humid air about the\r\npoles it may be as little as one foot. When contributed to the air,\r\nthe water enters on the state of vapour, in which state it tends to\r\ndiffuse itself freely through the atmosphere by virtue of the motion\r\nwhich is developed in particles when in the vaporous or gaseous state.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the water evaporated from the seas probably finds\r\nits way as rain at once back into the deep, yet a considerable portion\r\nis borne away horizontally until it encounters the land. The\r\nprecipitation of the water from the air is primarily due to the\r\ncooling to which it is subjected as it rises in the atmosphere. Over\r\nthe sea the ascent is accomplished by the simple diffusion of the\r\nvapour or by the uprise through the aërial shaft, such as that near\r\nthe equator or over the centres of the whirling storms. It is when the\r\nair strikes the slopes of the land that we find it brought into a\r\ncondition which most decidedly tends to precipitate its moisture.\r\nLifted upward, the air as it ascends the slopes is brought into cooler\r\nand more rarefied conditions. Losing temperature and expanding, it\r\nparts with its water for the same reason that it does in the ascending\r\ncurrent in the equatorial belt or in the chimneys of the whirl storms.\r\nA general consequence of this is that wherever moisture-laden winds\r\nfrom the sea impinge upon a continent they lay down a considerable\r\npart of the water which they contain.\r\n\r\nIf all the lands were of the same height, the rain would generally\r\ncome in largest proportion upon their coastal belt, or those portions\r\nof the shore-line districts over which the sea winds swept. But as\r\nthese winds vary in the amount of the watery vapour which they\r\ncontain, and as the surface of the land is very irregular, the\r\nrainfall is the most variable feature in the climatal conditions of\r\nour sphere. Near the coasts it ranges from two or three inches in arid\r\nregions--such as the western part of the Sahara and portions of the\r\ncoast regions of Chili and Peru--to eight hundred inches about the\r\nhead waters of the Brahmapootra River in northern India, where the\r\nhigh mountains are swept over by the moisture-laden airs from the\r\nneighbouring sea. Here and there detached mountainous masses produce a\r\nsingular local increase in the amount of the rainfall. Thus in the\r\nlake district in northwestern England the rainfall on the seaward side\r\nof mountains, not over four thousand feet high, is very much greater\r\nthan it is on the other slope, less than a score of miles away. These\r\nlocal variations are common all over the world, though they are but\r\nlittle observed.\r\n\r\nIn general, the central parts of continents are likely to receive much\r\nless rainfall than their peripheral portions. Thus the central\r\ndistricts of North America, Asia, and Australia--three out of the five\r\ncontinental masses--have what we may call interior deserts. Africa has\r\none such, though it is north of the centre, and extends to the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The only continent without this\r\ncentral nearly rainless field is South America, where the sole\r\ncharacteristic arid district is situated on the western slope of the\r\nCordilleran range. In this case the peculiarity is due to the fact\r\nthat the strong westerly setting winds which sweep over the country\r\nencounter no high mountains until they strike the Andean chain. They\r\njourney up a long and rather gradual slope, where the precipitation is\r\ngradually induced, the process being completed when they strike the\r\nmountain wall. Passing over its summit, they appear as dry winds on\r\nthe Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nEven while the winds frequently blow in from the sea, as along the\r\nwestern coast of the Americas, they may come over water which is\r\nprevailingly colder than the land. This is characteristically the case\r\non the western faces of the American continent, where the sea is\r\ncooled by the currents setting toward the equator from high latitudes.\r\nSuch cool sea air encountering the warm land has its temperature\r\nraised, and therefore does not tend to lay down its burden of\r\nmoisture, but seeks to take up more. On this account the rainfall in\r\ncountries placed under such conditions is commonly small.\r\n\r\nBy no means all the moisture which comes upon the earth from the\r\natmosphere descends in the form of rain or snow. A variable, large,\r\nthough yet undetermined amount falls in the form of dew. Dew is a\r\nprecipitation of moisture which has not entered the peculiar state\r\nwhich we term fog or cloud, but has remained invisible in the air. It\r\nis brought to the earth through the radiation of heat which\r\ncontinually takes place, but which is most effective during the\r\ndarkened half of the day, when the action is not counterbalanced by\r\nthe sun's rays. While the sun is high and the air is warm there is a\r\nconstant absorption of moisture in large part from the ground or from\r\nthe neighbouring water areas, probably in some part from those\r\nsuspended stores of water, the clouds, if such there be in the\r\nneighbourhood. We can readily notice how clouds drifting in from the\r\nsea often melt into the dry air which they encounter. Late in the\r\nafternoon, even before the sun has sunk, the radiation of heat from\r\nthe earth, which has been going on all the while, but has been less\r\nconsiderable than the incurrent of temperature, in a way overtakes\r\nthat influx. The air next the surface becomes cooled from its contact\r\nwith the refrigerating earth, and parts with its moisture, forming a\r\ncoating of water over everything it touches. At the same time the\r\nmoisture escaping from the warmed under earth likewise drops back upon\r\nits cooled surface almost as soon as it has escaped. The thin sheet of\r\nwater precipitated by this method is quickly returned to the air when\r\nit becomes warmed by the morning sunshine, but during the night\r\nquantities of it are absorbed by the plants; very often, indeed, with\r\nthe lowlier vegetation it trickles down the leaves and enters the\r\nearth about the base of the stem, so that the roots may appropriate\r\nit. Our maize, or Indian corn, affords an excellent example of a plant\r\nwhich, having developed in a land of droughts, is well contrived,\r\nthrough its capacities for gathering dew, to protect itself against\r\narid conditions. In an ordinary dew-making night the leaves of a\r\nsingle stem may gather as much as half a pint of water, which flows\r\ndown their surfaces to the roots. So efficient is this dew supply,\r\nthis nocturnal cloudless rain, that on the western coast of South\r\nAmerica and elsewhere, where the ordinary supply of moisture is almost\r\nwanting, many important plants are able to obtain from it much of the\r\nwater which they need. The effect is particularly striking along\r\nseashores, where the air, although it may not have the humidity\r\nnecessary for the formation of rain, still contains enough to form\r\ndew.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the quantity of dew which falls upon an\r\narea is generally proportioned to the amount of living vegetation\r\nwhich it bears. The surfaces of leaves are very efficient agents of\r\nradiation, and the tangle which they make offers an amount of\r\nheat-radiating area many times as great as that afforded by a surface\r\nof bared earth. Moreover, the ground itself can not well cool down to\r\nthe point where it will wring the moisture out of the air, while the\r\nthin membranes of the plants readily become so cooled. Thus vegetation\r\nby its own structure provides itself with means whereby it may be in a\r\nmeasure independent of the accidental rainfall. We should also note\r\nthe fact that the dewfall is a concomitant of cloudless skies. The\r\nquantity which is precipitated in a cloudy night is very small, and\r\nthis for the reason that when the heavens are covered the heat from\r\nthe earth can not readily fly off into space. Under these conditions\r\nthe temperature of the air rarely descends low enough to favour the\r\nprecipitation of dew.\r\n\r\nHaving noted the process by which in the rain circuit the water\r\nleaves the sea and the conditions of distribution when it returns to\r\nthe earth, we may now trace in more detail the steps in this great\r\nround. First, we should take note of the fact that the water after it\r\nenters the air may come back to the surface of the earth in either of\r\ntwo ways--directly in the manner of dewfall, or in a longer circuit\r\nwhich leads it through the state of clouds. As yet we are not very\r\nwell informed as to the law of the cloud-making, but certain features\r\nin this picturesque and most important process have been tolerably\r\nwell ascertained.\r\n\r\nRising upward from the sea, the vapour of water commonly remains\r\ntransparent and invisible until it attains a considerable height above\r\nthe surface, where the cooling tends to make it assume again the\r\nvisible state of cloud particles. The formation of these cloud\r\nparticles is now believed to depend on the fact that the air is full\r\nof small dust motes, exceedingly small bits of matter derived from the\r\nmany actions which tend to bring comminuted solid matter into the air,\r\nas, for instance, the combustion of meteoric stones, which are greatly\r\nheated by friction in their swift course through the air, the\r\nejections of volcanoes, the smoke of forest and other fires, etc.\r\nThese tiny bits, floating in the air, because of their solid nature\r\nradiate their heat, cool the air which lies against them, and thereby\r\nprecipitate the water in the manner of dew, exactly as do the leaves\r\nand other structures on the surface of the earth. In fact, dew\r\nformation is essentially like cloud formation, except that in the one\r\ncase the water is gathered on fixed bodies, and in the other on\r\nfloating objects. Each little dust raft with its cargo of condensed\r\nwater tends, of course, to fall downward toward the earth's surface,\r\nand, except for the winds which may blow upward, does so fall, though\r\nwith exceeding slowness. Its rate of descent may be only a few feet a\r\nday. It was falling before it took on the load of water; it will fall\r\na little more rapidly with the added burden, but even in a still air\r\nit might be months or years before it would come to the ground. The\r\nreason for this slow descent may not at first sight be plain, though a\r\nlittle consideration will make it so.\r\n\r\nIf we take a shot of small size and a feather of the same weight, we\r\nreadily note that their rate of falling through the air may vary in\r\nthe proportion of ten to one or more. It is easy to conceive that this\r\ndifference is due to the very much less friction which the smaller\r\nbody encounters in its motion by the particles of air. With this point\r\nin mind, the student should observe that the surface presented by\r\nsolid bodies in relation to their solid contents is the greater the\r\nsmaller the diameter. A rough, though not very satisfactory, instance\r\nof this principle may be had by comparing the surface and interior\r\ncontents of two boxes, one ten feet square and the other one foot\r\nsquare. The larger has six hundred feet of surface to one thousand\r\ncubic feet of interior, or about half a square foot of outer surface\r\nto the cubic foot of contents; while the smaller box has six feet of\r\nsurface for the single cubic foot of interior, or about ten times the\r\nproportion of exterior to contents. The result is that the smaller\r\nparticles encounter more friction in moving toward the earth, until,\r\nin the case of finely divided matter, such as the particles of carbon\r\nin the smoke from an ordinary fire, the rate of down-falling may be so\r\nsmall as to have little effect in the turbulent conditions of\r\natmospheric motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pocket Creek, Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Note the\r\nrelatively even size of the pebbles, and the splash wave which sets\r\nthem in motion._]\r\n\r\nThe little drops of water which gather round dust motes, falling but\r\nslowly toward the earth, are free to obey the attractions which they\r\nexercise upon each other--impulses which are partly gravitative and\r\npartly electrical. We have no precise knowledge concerning these\r\nmovements, further than that they serve to aggregate the myriad little\r\nfloats into cloud forms, in which the rafts are brought near together,\r\nbut do not actually touch each other. They are possibly kept apart by\r\nelectrical repulsion. In this state of association without union the\r\ndivided water may undergo the curiously modified aggregations which\r\ngive us the varied forms of clouds. As yet we know little as to the\r\ncause of cloud shapes. We remark the fact that in the higher of these\r\nagglomerations of condensed vapour, the clouds which float at an\r\nelevation of from twenty to thirty thousand feet or more, the masses\r\nare generally thin, and arranged more or less in a leaflike form,\r\nthough even here a tendency to produce spherical clouds is apparent.\r\nIn this high realm floating water is probably in the frozen state,\r\nanswering to the form of dew, which we call hoar frost. The lower\r\nclouds, gathering in the still air, show very plainly the tendency to\r\nagglomerate into spheres, which appears to be characteristic of all\r\nvaporous material which is free to move by its own impulses. It is\r\nprobable that the spherical shape of clouds is more or less due to the\r\nsame conditions as gathered the stellar matter from the ancient\r\nnebular chaos into the celestial spheres. Upon these spherical\r\naggregations of the clouds the winds act in extremely varied ways. The\r\ncloud may be rubbed between opposite currents, and so flattened out\r\ninto a long streamer; it may take the same form by being carried off\r\nby a current in the manner of smoke from a fire; the spheres may be\r\nkept together, so as to form the patchwork which we call \"mackerel\"\r\nsky; or they may be actually confounded with each other in a vast\r\ncommon cloud-heap. In general, where the process of aggregation of two\r\ncloud bodies occurs, changes of temperature are induced in the masses\r\nwhich are mixed together. If the temperature resulting from this\r\nassociation of cloud masses is an average increase, the cloud may\r\nbecome lighter, and in the manner of a balloon move upward. Each of\r\nthe motes in the cloud with its charge of vapour may be compared with\r\nthe ballast of the balloon; if they are warmed, they send forth a part\r\nof their load of condensed water again to the state of invisible\r\nvapour. Rising to a point where it cools, the vapour gathers back on\r\nthe rafts and tends again to weight the cloud downward. The ballast of\r\nan ordinary balloon has to be thrown away from its car; but if some\r\narrangement for condensing the moisture from the air could be\r\ncontrived, a balloon might be brought into the adjustable state of a\r\ncloud, going up or down according as it was heated or cooled.\r\n\r\nWhen the formation of the drop of water or snowflake begins, the mass\r\nis very small. If in descending it encounters great thickness of\r\ncloud, the bit may grow by further condensation until it becomes\r\nrelatively large. Generally in this way we may account for the\r\ndiversities in the size of raindrops or snowflakes. It often happens\r\nthat the particles after taking on the form of snowflakes encounter in\r\ntheir descent air so warm that they melt into raindrops, or, if only\r\npartly melted, reach the surface as sleet. Or, starting as raindrops,\r\nthey may freeze, and in this simple state may reach the earth, or\r\nafter freezing they may gather other frozen water about them, so that\r\nthe hailstone has a complicated structure which, from the point of\r\nview of classification, is between a raindrop and a snowflake.\r\n\r\nIn the process of condensation--indeed, in the steps which precede the\r\nformation of rain and snow--there is often more or less trace of\r\nelectrical action; in fact, a part of the energy which was involved in\r\nthe vapourization of water, on its condensation, even on the dust\r\nmotes appears to be converted into electrical action, which probably\r\noperates in part to keep the little aggregates of water asunder. When\r\nthey coalesce in drops or flakes, this electricity often assumes the\r\nform of lightning, which represents the swift passage of the electric\r\nstore from a region where it is most abundant to one where it is less\r\nso. The variations in this process of conveying the electricity are\r\nprobably great. In general, it probably passes, much as an electric\r\ncurrent is conveyed, through a wire from the battery which produces\r\nthe force. In other cases, where the tension is high, or, in other\r\nwords, where the discharge has to be hastened, we have the phenomena\r\nof lightning in which the current burns its way along its path, as it\r\nmay traverse a slender wire, vapourizing it as it goes. In general,\r\nthe lightning flash expends its force on the air conductors, or lines\r\nof the moist atmosphere along which it breaks its path, its energy\r\nreturning into the vapour which it forms or the heat which it produces\r\nin the other parts of the air. In some cases, probably not one in the\r\nthousand of the flashes, the charge is so heavy that it is not used up\r\nin its descent toward the earth, and so electrifies, or, as we say,\r\nstrikes, some object attached to the earth, through which it passes to\r\nthe underlying moisture, where it finds a convenient place to take on\r\na quiet form. Almost all these hurried movements of electrical energy\r\nwhich intensely heat and light the air which they traverse fly from\r\none part of a cloud to another, or cross from cloud sphere to cloud\r\nsphere; of those which start toward the earth, many are exhausted\r\nbefore they reach its surface, and even those that strike convey but a\r\nportion of their original impulse to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wearing-out effect of lightning in its journey along the air\r\nconductors in its flaming passages is well illustrated by what happens\r\nwhen the charge strikes a wire which is not large enough freely to\r\nconvey it. The wire is heated, generally made white hot, often melted,\r\nand perhaps scattered in the form of vapour. In doing this work the\r\nelectricity may, and often is, utterly dissipated--that is, changed\r\ninto heat. It has been proposed to take advantage of this principle in\r\nprotecting buildings from lightning by placing in them many thin\r\nwires, along which the current will try to make its way, being\r\nexhausted in melting or vaporizing the metal through which it passes.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other forms of lightning, or at least of electrical\r\ndischarges, which produce light and which may best be described in\r\nthis connection. It occasionally happens that the earth becomes so\r\ncharged that the current proceeds from its surface to the clouds. More\r\nrarely, and under conditions which we do not understand, the electric\r\nenergy is gathered into a ball-like form, which may move slowly along\r\nthe surface until it suddenly explodes. It is a common feature of all\r\nthese forms of lightning which we have noted that they ordinarily make\r\nin their movement considerable noise. This is due to the sudden\r\ndisplacement of the air which they traverse--displacement due to the\r\naction of heat in separating the particles. It is in all essential\r\nregards similar to the sounds made by projectiles, such as meteors or\r\nswift cannon shots, as they fly through the air. It is even more\r\ncomparable to the sound produced by exploding gunpowder. The first\r\nsound effect from the lightning stroke is a single rending note, which\r\nendures no longer--indeed, not as long--as the explosion of a cannon.\r\nHeard near by, this note is very sharp, reminding one of the sound\r\nmade by the breaking of glass. The rolling, continuous sound which we\r\ncommonly hear in thunder is, as in the case of the noise produced by\r\ncannon, due to echo from the clouds and the earth. Thunder is\r\nordinarily much more prolonged and impressive in a mountainous country\r\nthan in a region of plains, because the steeps about the hearer\r\nreverberate the original single crash.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of thunderstorms is as yet not well understood, but\r\nit appears in many cases that they are attendants on the advancing\r\nface of cyclones and hurricanes, the area in front of these great\r\nwhirlstorms being subjected to the condensation and irregular air\r\nmovements which lead to the development of much electrical energy.\r\nThere are, however, certain parts of the earth which are particularly\r\nsubjected to lightning flashes. They are common in the region near the\r\nequator, where the ascending currents bring about heavy rains, which\r\nmean a rapid condensation and consequent liberation of electrical\r\nenergy. They diminish in frequency toward the arctic regions. An\r\nobserver at the pole would probably fail ever to perceive strong\r\nflashes. For the same reason thunderstorms are more frequent in\r\nsummer, the time when the difference in temperature between the\r\nsurface and the upper air is greatest, when, therefore, the uprushes\r\nof air are likely to be most violent. They appear to be more common in\r\nthe night than in the daytime, for the reason that condensation is\r\nfavoured by the cooling which occurs in the dark half of the day. It\r\nis rare, indeed, that a thunderstorm occurs near midday, a period when\r\nthe air is in most cases taking up moisture on account of the swiftly\r\nincreasing heat.\r\n\r\nThere are other forms of electrical discharges not distinctly\r\nconnected with the then existing condensation of moisture. What the\r\nsailors call St. Elmo's fire--a brush of electric light from the mast\r\ntops and other projections of the ship--indicates the passage of\r\nelectrical energy between the vessel and the atmosphere. Similar\r\nlights are said sometimes to be seen rising from the surface of the\r\nwater. Such phenomena are at present not satisfactorily explained.\r\nPerhaps in the same group of actions comes the so-called\r\n\"Jack-o'-lantern\" or \"Will-o'-the-wisp\" fires flashing from the earth\r\nin marshy places, which are often described by the common people, but\r\nhave never been observed by a naturalist. If this class of\r\nilluminations really exists, we have to afford them some other\r\nexplanation than that they are emanations of self-inflamed\r\nphosphoretted hydrogen, a method of accounting for them which\r\nillogically finds a place in many treatises on atmospheric phenomena.\r\nA gas of any kind would disperse itself in the air; it could not dance\r\nabout as these lights are said to do, and there is no chemical means\r\nknown whereby it could be produced in sufficient purity and quantity\r\nfrom the earth to produce the effects which are described.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The present writer has made an extended and careful study\r\nof marsh and swamp phenomena, and is very familiar with the aspect of\r\nthese fields in the nighttime. He has never been able to see any sign of\r\nthe Jack-o'-lantern light. Looking fixedly into any darkness, such as is\r\nafforded by the depths of a wood, the eye is apt to imagine the\r\nappearance of faint lights. Those who have had to do with outpost duty\r\nin an army know how the anxious sentry, particularly if he is new to the\r\nsoldier's trade, will often imagine that he sees lights before him.\r\nSometimes the pickets will be so convinced of the fact that they see\r\nlights that they will fire upon the fiction of the imaginations. These\r\nfacts make it seem probable that the Jack-o'-lantern and his companion,\r\nthe Will-o'-the-wisp, are stories of the overcredulous.]\r\n\r\nIn the upper air, or perhaps even beyond the limits of the field\r\nwhich deserves the name, in the regions extending from the poles to\r\nnear the tropics, there occur electric glowings commonly known as the\r\naurora borealis. This phenomenon occurs in both hemispheres. These\r\nilluminations, though in some way akin to those of lightning, and\r\nthough doubtless due to some form of electrical action, are peculiar\r\nin that they are often attended by glows as if from clouds, and by\r\npulsations which indicate movements not at electric speed. As yet but\r\nlittle is known as to the precise nature of these curious storms. It\r\nhas been claimed, however, that they are related to the sun spots;\r\nthose periods when the solar spots are plenty, at intervals of about\r\neleven years, are the times of auroral discharges. Still further, it\r\nseems probable that the magnetic currents of the earth, that circling\r\nenergy which encompasses the sphere, moving round in a general way\r\nparallel to the equator, are intensified during these illuminations of\r\nthe circumpolar skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GEOLOGICAL WORK OF WATER.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the geological work which is performed by falling\r\nwater. Where the rain or snow returns from the clouds to the sea, the\r\nenergy of position given to the water by its elevation above the earth\r\nthrough the heat which it acquired from the sun is returned to the air\r\nthrough which it falls or to the ocean surface on which it strikes. In\r\nthis case the circuit of the rain is short and without geological\r\nconsequence which it is worth while to consider, except to note that\r\nthe heat thus returned is likely to be delivered in another realm than\r\nthat in which the falling water acquired the store, thus in a small\r\nway modifying the climate. When, however, the precipitation occurs on\r\nthe surface of the land, the drops of frozen or fluid water apply a\r\npart of their energy in important geological work, the like of which\r\nis not done where they return at once to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Showing the diverse action of rain on wooded\r\nand cleared fields, _a_, wooded area; _b_, tilled ground.]\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider what takes place when the water in the form of\r\ndrops of rain comes to the surface of the land. Descending as they do\r\nwith a considerable speed, these raindrops apply a certain amount of\r\nenergy to the surface on which they fall. Although the beat of a\r\nraindrop is proverbially light, the stroke is not ineffective.\r\nObserving what happens where the action takes place on the surface of\r\nbare rock, we may notice that the grains of sand or small pebbles\r\nwhich generally abound on such surfaces, if they be not too steeply\r\ninclined, dance about under the blows which they receive. If we could\r\ncover hard plate glass, a much firmer material than ordinary stone,\r\nwith such bits, we should soon find that its surface would become\r\nscratched all over by the friction. Moreover, the raindrops\r\nperceptibly urge the small detached bits of stone down the slopes\r\ntoward the streams.\r\n\r\nIf all the earth's surface were bare rocks, the blow of the raindrops\r\nwould deserve to be reckoned among the important influences which lead\r\nto the wearing of land. As it is, when a country is in a state of\r\nNature, only a small part of its surface is exposed to this kind of\r\nwearing. Where there is rain enough to effect any damage, there is\r\nsure to be sufficient vegetation to interpose a living and\r\nself-renewed covering between the rocks and the rain. Even the lichens\r\nwhich coat what at first sight often seems to be bare rock afford an\r\nample covering for this purpose. It is only where man bares the field\r\nby stripping away and overturning this protecting vegetation that the\r\nraindrops cut away the earth. The effect of their action can often be\r\nnoted by observing how on ploughed ground a flat stone or a potsherd\r\ncomes after a rain to cap a little column. The geologist sometimes\r\nfinds in soft sandstones that the same action is repeated in a larger\r\nway where a thin fragment of hard rock has protected a column many\r\nfeet in height against the rain work which has shorn down the\r\nsurrounding rock.\r\n\r\nWhen water strikes the moistened surface it at once loses the droplike\r\nform which all fluids assume when they fall through the air.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This principle of the spheroidal form in falling fluids is\r\nused in making ordinary bird shot. The melted lead drops through\r\nsievelike openings, the resulting spheres of the metal being allowed to\r\nfall into water which chills them. Iron shot, used in cutting stone,\r\nwhere they are placed between the saw and the surface of the rock, are\r\nalso made in the same manner. The descending fluid divides into drops\r\nbecause it is drawn out by the ever-increasing speed of the falling\r\nparticles, which soon make the stream so thin that it can not hold\r\ntogether.]\r\n\r\nWhen the raindrops coalesce on the surface of the earth, the rôle of\r\nwhat we may call land water begins. Thenceforward until the fluid\r\narrives at the surface of the sea it is continually at work in\r\neffecting a great range of geological changes, only a few of which can\r\nwell be traced by the general student. The work of land water is due\r\nto three classes of properties--to the energy with which it is endowed\r\nby virtue of its height above the sea, a power due to the heat of the\r\nsun; to the capacity it has for taking substances into solution; and\r\nto its property of giving some part of its own substance to other\r\nmaterials with which it comes in contact. The first of these groups of\r\nproperties may be called dynamical; the others, chemical.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic value of water when it falls upon the land is the amount\r\nof energy it can apply in going down the slope which separates it from\r\nthe sea. A ton of the fluid, such as may gather in an ordinary rain on\r\na thousand square feet of ground in the highlands of a country--say at\r\nan elevation of a thousand feet above the sea--expends before it comes\r\nto rest in the great reservoir as much energy as would be required to\r\nlift that weight from the ocean's surface to the same height. The ways\r\nin which this energy may be expended we shall now proceed in a general\r\nway to trace.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the water has been gathered, from its drop to its sheet\r\nstate--a process which takes place as soon as it falls--the fluid\r\nbegins its downward journey. On this way it is at once parted into two\r\ndistinct divisions, the surface water and the ground water: the former\r\ncourses more or less swiftly, generally at the rate of a mile or more\r\nan hour, in the light of day; the latter enters the interstices of the\r\nearth, slowly descends therein to a greater or less depth, and\r\nfinally, journeying perhaps at the rate of a mile a year, rejoins the\r\nsurface water, escaping through the springs. The proportion of these\r\ntwo classes, the surface and the ground water, varies greatly, and an\r\nintermixture of them is continually going on. Thus on the surface of\r\nbare rock or frozen earth all the rain may go away without entering\r\nthe ground. On very sandy fields the heaviest rainfall may be taken\r\nup by the porous earth, so that no streams are found. On such surfaces\r\nthe present writer has observed that a rainfall amounting to six\r\ninches in depth in two hours produced no streams whatever. We shall\r\nfirst follow the history of the surface water, afterward considering\r\nthe work which the underground movements effect.\r\n\r\nIf the student will observe what takes place on a level ploughed\r\nfield--which, after all, will not be perfectly level, for all fields\r\nare more or less undulating--he will note that, though the surface may\r\nhave been smoothed by a roller until it appears like a floor, the\r\nfirst rain, where the fall takes place rapidly enough to produce\r\nsurface streams, will create a series of little channels which grow\r\nlarger as they conjoin, the whole appearing to the eye like a very\r\ndetailed map, or rather model, of a river system; it is, indeed, such\r\na system in miniature. If he will watch the process by which these\r\nstreamlet beds are carved, he will obtain a tolerably clear idea as to\r\nthat most important work which the greater streams do in carving the\r\nface of the lands. The water is no sooner gathered into a sheet than,\r\nguided by the slightest irregularities which it encounters, it begins\r\nto flow. At first the motion is so slow that it does not disturb its\r\nbed, but at some points in the bottom of the sheet the movement soon\r\nbecomes swift enough to drag the grains of sand and clay from their\r\nadhesions, bearing them onward. As soon as this beginning of a channel\r\nis formed the water moves more swiftly in the clearer way; it\r\ntherefore cuts more rapidly, deepening and enlarging its channel, and\r\nmaking its motion yet more free. The tiny rills join the greater, all\r\ntheir channels sway to and fro as directed this way and that by chance\r\nirregularities, until something like river basins are carved out,\r\nthose gentle slopes which form broad valleys where the carving has\r\nbeen due to the wanderings of many streams. If the field be large,\r\nconsiderable though temporary brooks may be created, which cut\r\nchannels perhaps a foot in depth. At the end of this miniature stream\r\nsystem we always find some part of the waste which has been carved\r\nout. If the streamlet discharges into a pool, we find the tiny\r\nrepresentative of deltas, which form such an important feature on the\r\ncoast line where large rivers enter seas or lakes. Along the lines of\r\nthe stream we may observe here and there little benches, which are the\r\nequivalent in all save size of the terraces that are generally to be\r\nobserved along the greater streams. In fact, these accidents of an\r\nacre help in a most effective way the student to understand the\r\ngreater and more complicated processes of continental erosion.\r\n\r\nA normal river--in fact, all the greater streams of the\r\nearth--originates in high country, generally in a region of mountains.\r\nHere, because of the elevation of the region, the streams have cut\r\ndeep gorges or extensive valleys, all of which have slopes leading\r\nsteeply downward to torrent beds. Down these inclined surfaces the\r\nparticles worn off from the hard rock by frost and by chemical decay\r\ngradually work their way until they attain the bed of the stream. The\r\nagents which assist gravitation in bearing this detritus downward are\r\nmany, but they all work together for the same end. The stroke of the\r\nraindrop accomplishes something, though but little; the direct washing\r\naction of the brooklets which form during times of heavy rain, but dry\r\nout at the close of the storm, do a good deal of the work; thawing and\r\nfreezing of the water contained in the mass of detritus help the\r\nmovement, for, although the thrust is in both directions, it is most\r\neffective downhill; the wedges of tree roots, which often penetrate\r\nbetween and under the stones, and there expand in their process of\r\ngrowth, likewise assist the downward motion. The result is that on\r\nordinary mountain slopes the layer of fragments constituting the rude\r\nsoil is often creeping at the rate of from some inches to some feet a\r\nyear toward the torrent bed. If there be cliffs at the top of the\r\nslope, as is often the case, very extensive falls of rock may take\r\nplace from it, the masses descending with such speed that they\r\ndirectly attain the stream. If the steeps be low and the rock divided\r\ninto vertical joints, especially where there is a soft layer at the\r\nbase of the steep, detached masses from the precipice may move slowly\r\nand steadfastly down the slope, so little disturbed in their journey\r\nthat trees growing upon their summits may continue to develop for the\r\nthousands of years before the mass enters the stream bed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fall of rocks from precipices does not often take place\r\nin a conspicuously large way, all great mountain regions which have\r\nlong been inhabited by man abound in traditions and histories of such\r\naccidents. Within a century or two there have been a dozen or more\r\ncatastrophes of this nature in the inhabited valleys of the Alps. As\r\nthese accidents are at once instructive and picturesque, it is well to\r\nnote certain of them in some detail. At Yvorgne, a little parish on\r\nthe north shore of the Rhône, just above the lake of Geneva, tradition\r\ntells that an ancient village of the name was overwhelmed by the fall\r\nof a great cliff. The vast _débris_ forming the steep slope which was\r\nthus produced now bears famous vineyards, but the vintners fancy that\r\nthey from time to time hear deep in the earth the ringing of the bells\r\nwhich belonged to the overwhelmed church. In 1806 the district of\r\nGoldau, just north of Lake Lucerne, was buried beneath the ruins of a\r\npeak which, resting upon a layer of clay, slipped away like a\r\nlaunching ship on the surface of the soft material. The _débris_\r\noverwhelmed a village and many detached houses, and partly filled a\r\nconsiderable lake. The wind produced by this vast rush of falling rock\r\nwas so great that people were blown away by it; some, indeed, were\r\nkilled in this singular manner.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting field of these Swiss mountain falls is a high\r\nmountain valley of amphitheatrical form, known as the Diablerets, or\r\nthe devil's own district. This great circus, which lies at the height\r\nof about four thousand feet above the sea, is walled around on its\r\nnorthern side by a precipice, above which rest, or rather once\r\nrested, a number of mountain peaks of great bulk. The region has long\r\nbeen valued for the excellent pasturage which the head of the valley\r\naffords. Two costly roads, indeed, have been built into it to afford\r\nfootpaths for the flocks and herds and their keepers in the summer\r\nseason. Through this human experience with the valley, we have a\r\nrecord of what has gone on in this part of the mountain wilderness.\r\nWithin the period of history and tradition, three very great mountain\r\nfalls have occurred in this field, each having made its memory good by\r\nwidespread disaster which it brought to the people of the _chalets_.\r\nThe last of these was brought about by the fall of a great peak which\r\nspread itself out in a vast field of ruins in the valley below. The\r\nbelt of destruction was about half a mile wide and three miles long.\r\nWhen the present writer last saw it, a quarter of a century ago, it\r\nwas still a wilderness of great rocks, but here and there the process\r\nof their decay was giving a foothold for herbage, and in a few\r\ncenturies the field will doubtless be so verdure-clad that its story\r\nwill not be told on its face. It is likely, however, to be preserved\r\nin the memory of the people, and this through a singular and pathetic\r\ntradition which has grown up about the place, one which, if not true,\r\ncomes at least among the legends which we should like to believe.\r\n\r\nAs told the present writer by a native of the district, it happened\r\nwhen, in the nighttime the mountain came down, the herdsmen and their\r\ncows gathered in the _chalets_--stout buildings which are prepared to\r\nresist avalanches of snow. In one of these, which was protected from\r\ncrushing by the position of the stones which covered it, a solitary\r\nherdsman found himself alive in his unharmed dwelling. With him in the\r\ndarkness were the cows, a store of food and water, and his provisions\r\nfor the long summer season. With nothing but hope to animate him, he\r\nset to work burrowing upward among the rocks, storing the _débris_ in\r\nthe room of the _chalet_. He toiled for some months, but finally\r\nemerged to the light of day, blanched by his long imprisonment in the\r\ndarkness, but with the strength to bear him to his home. In place of\r\nthe expected warm welcome, the unhappy man found himself received as a\r\nghost. He was exorcised by the priest and driven away to the distance.\r\nIt was only when long afterward his path of escape was discovered that\r\nhis history became known.\r\n\r\nReturning to the account of the _débris_ which descends at varied\r\nspeed into the torrents, we find that when the detritus encounters the\r\naction of these vigorous streams it is rapidly ground to pieces while\r\nit is pushed down the steep channels to the lower country. Where the\r\nstones are of such size that the stream can urge them on, they move\r\nrapidly; at least in times when the torrent is raging. They beat over\r\neach other and against the firm-set rocks; the more they wear, the\r\nsmaller they become, and the more readily they are urged forward.\r\nWhere the masses are too large to be stirred by the violent current,\r\nthey lie unmoved until the pounding of the rolling stones reduces them\r\nto the proportions where they may join the great procession.\r\nOrdinarily those who visit mountains behold their torrents only in\r\ntheir shrunken state, when the waters stir no stones, and fail even to\r\nbear a charge of mud, all detachable materials having been swept away\r\nwhen the streams course with more vigour. In storm seasons the\r\nconditions are quite otherwise; then the swollen torrents, their\r\nwaters filled with clay and sand, bear with them great quantities of\r\nboulders, the collisions of which are audible above the muffled roar\r\nof the waters, attesting the very great energy of the action.\r\n\r\nWhen the waste on a mountain slope lies at a steep angle, particularly\r\nwhere the accumulation is due to the action of ancient glaciers, it\r\nnot infrequently happens that when the ground is softened with frost\r\ngreat masses of the material rush down the slope in the manner of\r\nlandslides. The observer readily notes that in many mountain regions,\r\nas, for instance, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, the steep\r\nslopes are often seamed by the paths of these great landslides. Their\r\nmovement, indeed, is often begun by sliding snow, which gives an\r\nimpulse to the rocks and earth which it encounters in its descent. At\r\na place known as the Wylie Notch, in the White Mountains, in the early\r\npart of this century, a family of that name was buried beneath a mass\r\nof glacial waste which had hung on the mountain slope from the ancient\r\ndays until a heavy rain, following on a period of thaw, impelled the\r\nmass down the slope. Although there have been few such catastrophes\r\nnoted in this country, it is because our mountains have not been much\r\ndwelt in. As they become thickly inhabited as the Alps are, men are\r\nsure to suffer from these accidents.\r\n\r\nAs the volume of a mountain torrent increases through the junction of\r\nmany tributaries, the energy of its moving waters becomes sufficient\r\nto sweep away the fragments which come to its bed. Before this stage\r\nis attained the stream rarely touches the solid under rock of the\r\nmountain, the base of the current resting upon the larger loose stones\r\nwhich it was unable to stir. In this pebble-paved section, because the\r\nstream could not attack the foundation rock, we find no gorges--in\r\nfact, the whole of this upper section of the torrent system is\r\npeculiarly conditioned by the fact that the streams are dealing not\r\nwith bed-rock, but with boulders or smaller loose fragments. If they\r\ncut a little channel, the materials from either side slip the faster,\r\nand soon repave the bed. But when the streams have by a junction\r\ngained strength, and can keep their beds clear, they soon carve down a\r\ngorge through which they descend from the upper mountain realm to the\r\nlarger valleys, where their conjoined waters take on a riverlike\r\naspect. It should be noted here that the cutting power of the water\r\nmoving in the torrent or in the wave, the capacity it has for abrading\r\nrock, resides altogether in the bits of stone or cutting tools with\r\nwhich it is armed. Pure water, because of its fluidity, may move over\r\nor against firm-set stones for ages without wearing them; but in\r\nproportion as it moves rocky particles of any size, the larger they\r\nare, the more effective the work, it wears the rock over which it\r\nflows. A capital instance of this may be found where a stream from a\r\nhose is used in washing windows. If the water be pure, there is no\r\neffect upon the glass; but if it be turbid, containing bits of sand,\r\nin a little while the surface will appear cloudy from the multitude of\r\nline scratches which the hard bits impelled by the water have\r\ninflicted upon it. A somewhat similar case occurs where the wind bears\r\nsand against window panes or a bottle which has long lain on the\r\nshore. The glass will soon be deeply carved by the action, assuming\r\nthe appearance which we term \"ground.\" This principle is made use of\r\nin the arts. Glass vessels or sheets are prepared for carving by\r\npasting paper cut into figures on their surfaces. The material is then\r\nexposed to a jet of air or steam-impelling sand grains; in a short\r\ntime all the surface which has not been protected by paper has its\r\npolish destroyed and is no longer translucent.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the torrent to the river, though not in a\r\ngeographical way distinct, is indicated to the observant eye by a\r\nsimple feature--namely, the appearance of alluvial terraces, those\r\nmore or less level heaps of water-borne _débris_ which accumulate\r\nalong the banks of rivers, which, indeed, constitute the difference\r\nbetween those streams and torrents. Where the mountain waters move\r\nswiftly, they manage to bear onward the waste which they receive. Even\r\nwhere the blocks of stone cling in the bed, it is only a short time\r\nbefore they are again set in motion or ground to pieces. If by chance\r\nthe detritus accumulates rapidly, the slope is steepened and the work\r\nof the torrent made more efficient. As the torrent comes toward the\r\nbase of the mountains, where it neither finds nor can create steep\r\nslopes over which to flow, its speed necessarily diminishes. With each\r\nreduction in this feature its carrying power very rapidly diminishes.\r\nThus water flowing at the rate of ten miles an hour can urge stones\r\nfour times the mass that it can move when its speed is reduced to half\r\nthat rate. The result is that on the lowlands, with their relatively\r\ngentle slopes, the combined torrents, despite the increase in the\r\nvolume of the stream arising from their confluence, have to lay down a\r\nlarge part of their load of detritus.\r\n\r\nIf we watch where a torrent enters a mountain river, we observe that\r\nthe main stream in a way sorts over the waste contributed to it,\r\nbearing on only those portions which its rate of flow will permit it\r\nto carry, leaving the remainder to be built into the bank in the form\r\nof a rude terrace. This accumulation may not extend far below the\r\npoint where the torrent which imported the _débris_ joins the main\r\nstream; a little farther down, however, we are sure to find another\r\nsuch junction and a second accumulation of terrace material. As these\r\ncontributions increase, the terrace accumulations soon become\r\ncontinuous, lying on one side or the other of the river, sometimes\r\nbordering both banks of the stream. In general, it can be said that so\r\nlong as the rate of fall of the torrent exceeds one hundred feet to\r\nthe mile it does not usually exhibit these shelves of detritus. Below\r\nthat rate of descent they are apt to be formed. Much, however, depends\r\nupon the amount of detritus which the stream bears and the coarseness\r\nof it; moreover, where the water goes through a gorge in the manner of\r\na flume with steep rocky sides, it can urge a larger amount before it\r\nthan when it traverses a wide valley, through which it passes, it may\r\nbe, in a winding way.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it may seem rather a fine distinction to separate\r\ntorrents from rivers by the presence or absence of terraces. As we\r\nfollow down the stream, however, and study its action in relation to\r\nthese terraces, and the peculiar history of the detritus of which they\r\nare composed, we perceive that these latter accumulations are very\r\nimportant features. Beginning at first with small and imperfect\r\nalluvial plains, the river, as it descends toward the sea, gaining in\r\nstore of water and in the amount of _débris_ which comes with that\r\nwater from the hills, while the rate of fall and consequent speed of\r\nthe current are diminished, soon comes to a stage where it is engaged\r\nin an endless struggle with the terrace materials. In times of flood,\r\nthe walls of the terraces compel the tide to flow over the tops of\r\nthese accumulations. Owing to the relative thinness of the water\r\nbeyond the bed, and to the growth of vegetation there, the current\r\nmoves more slowly, and therefore lays down a considerable deposit of\r\nthe silt and sand which it contains. This may result during a single\r\nflood in lifting the level of the terrace by some inches in height,\r\nstill further serving to restrict the channel. Along the banks of the\r\nMississippi and other large rivers the most of this detritus falls\r\nnear the stream; a little of it penetrates to the farther side of the\r\nplains, which often have a width of ten miles or more. The result is\r\nthat a broad elevation is constructed, a sort of natural mole or\r\nlevee, in a measure damming the flood waters, which can now only enter\r\nthe \"back swamps\" through the channels of the tributary streams. Each\r\nof these back swamps normally discharges into the main stream through\r\na little river of its own, along the banks of which the natural levees\r\ndo not develop.\r\n\r\nWe have now to note a curious swinging movement of rivers which was\r\nfirst well observed by the skilful engineers of British India. This\r\nmovement can best be illustrated by its effects. If on any river which\r\nwinds through alluvial plains a jetty is so constructed as to deflect\r\nthe stream at any point, the course which it follows will be altered\r\nduring its subsequent flow, it may be, for the distance of hundreds of\r\nmiles. It will be perceived that in its movements a river normally\r\nstrikes first against one shore and then against the other. Its water\r\nin a general way moves as does a billiard ball when it flies from one\r\ncushion to another. It is true that in a torrent we have the same\r\nconditions of motion; but there the banks are either of hard rock or,\r\nif of detritus, they are continually moving into the stream in the\r\nmanner before described. In the case of the river, however, its points\r\nof collision are often on soft banks, which are readily undermined by\r\nthe washing action of the stream. In the ordinary course of events,\r\nthe river beginning, we may imagine, with a straight channel, had its\r\ncurrent deflected by some obstacle, it may be even by the slight\r\npressure of a tributary stream, is driven against one bank; thence it\r\nrebounds and strikes the other. At each point of impinge it cuts the\r\nalluvium away. It can bear on only a small portion of that which it\r\nthus obtains; the greater part of the material is deposited on the\r\nopposite side of the stream, but a little lower down, where it makes a\r\nshallow. On these shallows water-loving plants and even certain trees,\r\nsuch as the willows and poplars, find a foothold. When the stream\r\nrises, the sediment settles in this tangle, and soon extends the\r\nalluvial plain from the neighbouring bank, or in rarer cases the river\r\ncomes to flow on either side of an island of its own construction. The\r\nnatural result of this billiard-ball movement of the waters is that\r\nthe path of the stream is sinuous. The less its rate of fall and the\r\ngreater the amount of silt it obtains from its tributaries, the more\r\nwinding its course becomes. This gain in those parts of the river's\r\ncurvings where deposition tends to take place may be accelerated by\r\ntree-planting. Thus a skilful owner of a tract of land on the south\r\nbank of the Ohio River, by assiduously planting willow trees on the\r\nfront of his property, gained in the course of thirty years more than\r\nan acre in the width of his arable land. When told by the present\r\nwriter that he was robbing his neighbours on the other side of the\r\nstream, he claimed that their ignorance of the laws of river motion\r\nwas sufficient evidence that they did not deserve to own land.\r\n\r\nIn the primitive state of a country the water-loving plants,\r\nparticularly the trees which flourish in excessively humid conditions,\r\ngenerally make a certain defence against these incursions of the\r\nstreams. But when a river has gained an opening in the bank it can,\r\nduring a flood, extend its width often to the distance of hundreds of\r\nfeet. During the inundations of the Mississippi the river may at times\r\nbe seen to eat away acres of land in a single day along one of the\r\noutcurves of its banks. The undermined forests falling into the flood\r\njoin the great procession of drift timber, composed of trees which\r\nhave been similarly uprooted, which occupies the middle part of the\r\nstream. This driftwood belt often has a width of three or four hundred\r\nfeet, the entangled stems and branches making it difficult for a boat\r\nto pass from one side of the river to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Oxbows and cut-off. Showing the changes in\r\nthe course of a river in its alluvial plain.]\r\n\r\nWhen the curves of a river have been developed to a certain point (see\r\nFig. 11), when they have attained what is called the \"oxbow\" form, it\r\noften happens that the stream breaks through the isthmus which\r\nconnects one of the peninsulas with the mainland. Where, as is not\r\ninfrequently the case, the bend has a length of ten miles or more, the\r\nwater just above and below the new-made opening is apt to differ in\r\nheight by some feet. Plunging down the declivity, the stream, flowing\r\nwith great velocity, soon enlarges the channel so that its whole tide\r\nmay take the easier way. When this result is accomplished, the old\r\ncurve is deserted, sand bars are formed across their mouths, which may\r\ngradually grow to broad alluvial plains, so that the long-surviving,\r\ncrescent-shaped lake, the remnant of the river bed, may be seen far\r\nfrom the present course of the ever-changing stream. Gradually the\r\naccumulations of vegetable matter and the silt brought in by floods\r\nefface this moat or oxbow cut-off, as it is so commonly termed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the river breaks through the neck of a peninsula in the\r\nmanner above described, the current of the stream becomes much swifter\r\nfor many miles below and above the opening. Slowly, however, the\r\nslopes are rearranged throughout its whole course, yet for a time the\r\nstream near the seat of the change becomes straighter than before, and\r\nthis for the reason that its swifter current is better able to dispose\r\nof the _débris_ which is supplied to it. The effect of a change in the\r\ncurrent produced by such new channels as we have described as forming\r\nacross the isthmuses of bends is to perturb the course of the stream\r\nin all its subsequent downward length. Thus an oxbow cut-off formed\r\nnear the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi may tend more or less to\r\nalter the swings of the Mississippi all the way to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAlthough the swayings of the streams to and fro in their alluvial\r\nplains will give the reader some idea as to the struggle which the\r\ngreater rivers have with the _débris_ which is committed to them, the\r\nfull measure of the work and its consequences can only be appreciated\r\nby those who have studied the phenomena on the ground. A river such\r\nas the Mississippi is endlessly endeavouring to bear its burden to the\r\nsea. If its slope were a uniform inclined plane, the task might\r\nreadily be accomplished; but in this, as in almost all other large\r\nwater ways, the slope of the bed is ever diminishing with its onward\r\ncourse. The same water which in the mountain torrent of the\r\nAppalachians or Cordilleras rolled along stones several feet in\r\ndiameter down slopes of a hundred feet or more to the mile can in the\r\nlower reaches of the stream move no pebbles which are more than one\r\nfourth of an inch in diameter over slopes which descend on the average\r\nabout half a foot in a mile. Thus at every stage from the torrent to\r\nthe sea the detritus has from time to time to rest within the alluvial\r\nbanks, there awaiting the decay which slowly comes, and which may\r\nbring it to the state where it may be dissolved in the water, or\r\ndivided into fragments so small that the stream may bear them on. A\r\ncomputation which the present writer has made shows that, on the\r\naverage, it requires about forty thousand years for a particle of\r\nstone to make its way down the Mississippi to the sea after it has\r\nbeen detached from its original bed. Of course, some bits may make the\r\njourney straightforwardly; others may require a far greater time to\r\naccomplish the course which the water itself makes at most in a few\r\nweeks. This long delay in the journey of the detritus--a delay caused\r\nby its frequent rests in the alluvial plain--brings about important\r\nconsequences which we will now consider.\r\n\r\nAs an alluvial plain is constructed, we generally find at the base\r\npebbly material which fell to the bottom in the current of the main\r\nstream as the shores grew outward. Above this level we find the\r\ndeposits laid down by the flood waters containing no pebbles, and this\r\nfor the reason that those weightier bits remained in the stream bed\r\nwhen the tide flowed over the plain. As the alluvial deposit is laid\r\ndown, a good deal of vegetable matter was built into it. Generally\r\nthis has decayed and disappeared. On the surface of the plain there\r\nhas always been growing abundant vegetation, the remains of which\r\ndecayed on the surface in the manner which we may observe at the\r\npresent day. This decomposing vegetable matter within and upon the\r\nporous alluvial material produces large quantities of carbonic acid, a\r\ngas which readily enters the rain water, and gives it a peculiar power\r\nof breaking up rock matter. Acting on the _débris_, this gas-charged\r\nwater rapidly brings about a decay of the fragments. Much of the\r\nmaterial passes at once into solution in this water, and drains away\r\nthrough the multitudinous springs which border the river. As this\r\nmatter is completely dissolved, as is sugar in water, it goes straight\r\naway to the sea without ever again entering the alluvium. In many, if\r\nnot most, cases this dissolving work which is going on in alluvial\r\nterraces is sufficient to render a large part of the materials which\r\nthey contain into the state where it disappears in an unseen manner;\r\nthus while the annual floods are constantly laying down accumulations\r\non the surface of these plains, the springs are bearing it away from\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIn this way, through the decomposition which takes place in them, all\r\nthose river terraces where much vegetable matter is mingled with the\r\nmineral substances, become laboratories in which substances are\r\nbrought into solution and committed to the seas. We find in the water\r\nof the ocean a great array of dissolved mineral substances; it,\r\nindeed, seems probable that the sea water contains some share, though\r\nusually small, of all the materials which rivers encounter in their\r\njourney over and under the lands. As the waters of the sea obtain but\r\nlittle of this dissolved matter along the coast, it seems likely that\r\nthe greater share of it is brought into the state of solution in the\r\nnatural laboratories of the alluvial plains.\r\n\r\nHere and there along the sides of the valleys in which the rivers flow\r\nwe commonly find the remains of ancient plains lying at more or less\r\nconsiderable heights above the level of the streams. Generally these\r\ndeposits, which from their form are called terraces, represent the\r\nstages of down-wearing by which the stream has carved out its way\r\nthrough the rocks. The greater part of these ancient alluvial plains\r\nhas been removed through the ceaseless swinging of the stream to and\r\nfro in the valley which it has excavated.\r\n\r\nIn all the states of alluvial plains, whether they be the fertile\r\ndeposits near the level of the streams which built them, or the poorer\r\nand ruder surfaced higher terraces, they have a great value to\r\nmankind. Men early learned that these lands were of singularly uniform\r\ngoodness for agricultural use. They are so light that they were easily\r\ndelved with the ancient pointed sticks or stone hoes, or turned by the\r\nolden, wooden plough. They not only give a rich return when first\r\nsubjugated, but, owing to the depth of the soil and the frequency with\r\nwhich they are visited by fertilizing inundations, they yield rich\r\nharvests without fertilizing for thousands of years. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that we find the peoples who depended upon tillage for\r\nsubsistence first developed on the great river plains. There, indeed,\r\nwere laid the foundations of our higher civilization; there alone\r\ncould the state which demands of its citizens fixed abodes and\r\ncontinuous labour take rise. In the conditions which these fields of\r\nabundance afforded, dense populations were possible, and all the arts\r\nwhich lead toward culture were greatly favoured. Thus it is that the\r\ncivilization of China, India, Persia, and Egypt, the beginnings of\r\nman's higher development, began near the mouths of the great river\r\nvalleys. These fields were, moreover, most favourably placed for the\r\ninstitution of commerce, in that the arts of navigation, originating\r\nin the sheltered reaches of the streams, readily found its way through\r\nthe estuaries to the open sea.\r\n\r\nPassing down the reaches of a great river as it approaches the sea, we\r\nfind that the alluvial plains usually widen and become lower. At\r\nlength we attain a point where the flood waters cover the surface for\r\nso large a part of the year that the ground is swampy and untillable\r\nunless it is artificially and at great expense of labour won to\r\nagriculture in the manner in which this task has been effected in the\r\nlower portion of the Rhine Valley. Still farther toward the sea, the\r\nplain gradually dips downward until it passes below the level of the\r\nwaters. Through this mud-flat section the stream continues to cut\r\nchannels, but with the ever-progressive slowing of its motion the\r\nburden of fine mud which it carries drops to the bottom, and\r\nconstantly closes the paths through which the water escapes. Every few\r\nyears they tend to break a new way on one side or the other of their\r\nformer path. Some of the greatest engineering work done in modern\r\ntimes has been accomplished by the engineers engaged in controlling\r\nthe exits of large rivers to the sea. The outbreak of the Yellow River\r\nin 1887, in which the stream, hindered by its own accumulations,\r\nforced a new path across its alluvial plains, destroyed a vast deal of\r\nlife and property, and made the new exit seventy miles from the path\r\nwhich it abandoned.\r\n\r\nBelow the surface of the open water the alluvial deposits spread out\r\ninto a broad fan, which slopes gradually to a point where, in the\r\nmanner of the continental shelf, the bottom descends steeply into deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom of naturalists to divide the lower section of river\r\ndeposits--that part of the accumulation which is near the sea--from\r\nthe other alluvial plains, terming the lower portion the delta. The\r\nword originally came into use to describe that part of the alluvium\r\naccumulated by the Nile near its mouth, which forms a fertile\r\nterritory shaped somewhat like the fourth letter of the Greek\r\nalphabet. Although the definition is good in the Egyptian instance,\r\nand has a certain use elsewhere, we best regard all the detritus in a\r\nriver valley which is in the state of repose along the stream to its\r\nutmost branches as forming one great whole. It is, indeed, one of the\r\nmost united of the large features which the earth exhibits. The\r\nstudent should consider it as a continuous inclined plane of\r\ndiminishing slope, extending from the base of the torrents to the\r\nsea, and of course ramifying into the several branches of the river\r\nsystem. He should further bear in mind the fact that it is a vast\r\nlaboratory where rock material is brought into the soluble state for\r\ndelivery to the seas.\r\n\r\nThe diversity in the form of river valleys is exceedingly great.\r\nAlmost all the variety of the landscape is due to this impress of\r\nwater action which has operated on the surface in past ages. When\r\nfirst elevated above the sea, the surface of the land is but little\r\nvaried; at this stage in the development the rivers have but shallow\r\nvalleys, which generally cut rather straight away over the plain\r\ntoward the sea. It is when the surface has been uplifted to a\r\nconsiderable height, and especially when, as is usually the case, this\r\nuplifting action has been associated with mountain-building, that\r\nvalleys take on their accented and picturesque form. The reason for\r\nthis is easily perceived: it lies in the fact that the rocks over\r\nwhich the stream flows are guided in the cutting which they effect by\r\nthe diversities of hardness in the strata that they encounter. The\r\nwork which it does is performed by the hard substances that are\r\nimpelled by the current, principally by the sand and pebbles. These\r\nmaterials, driven along by the stream, become eroding tools of very\r\nconsiderable energy. As will be seen when we shortly come to describe\r\nwaterfalls, the potholes formed at those points afford excellent\r\nevidence as to the capacity of stream-impelled bits of stone to cut\r\naway the firmest bed rocks. Naturally the ease with which this carving\r\nwork is done is proportionate to the energy of the currents, and also\r\nto the relative hardness of the moving bits and the rocks over which\r\nthey are driven.\r\n\r\nSo long as the rocks lie horizontally in their natural construction\r\nattitude the course of the stream is not much influenced by the\r\nvariations in hardness which the bed exhibits. Where the strata are\r\nvery firm there is likely to be a narrow gorge, the steeps of which\r\nrise on either side with but slight alluvial plains; where the beds\r\nare soft the valley widens, perhaps again to contract where in the\r\ncourse of its descent it encounters another hard layer. Where,\r\nhowever, the beds have been subjected to mountain-building, and have\r\nbeen thrown into very varied attitudes by folding and faulting, the\r\nstream now here and now there encounters beds which either restrain\r\nits flow or give it freedom. The stream is then forced to cut its way\r\naccording to the positions of the various underlying strata. This\r\neffect upon its course is not only due to the peculiarities of\r\nuplifted rocks, but to manifold accidents of other nature: veins and\r\ndikes, which often interlace the beds with harder or softer partitions\r\nthan the country rock; local hardenings in the materials, due to\r\ncrystallization and other chemical processes, often create\r\nindescribable variations which are more or less completely expressed\r\nin the path of the stream.\r\n\r\nWhen a land has been newly elevated above the sea there is often--we\r\nmay say, indeed, generally--a very great difference between the height\r\nof its head waters and the ocean level. In this condition of a country\r\nthe rivers have what we may call a new aspect; their valleys are\r\ncommonly narrow and rather steep, waterfalls are apt to abound, and\r\nthe alluvial terraces are relatively small in extent. Stage by stage\r\nthe torrents cut deeper; the waste which they make embarrasses the\r\ncourse of the lower waters, where no great amount of down-cutting is\r\npossible for the reason that the bed of the stream is near sea level.\r\nAt the same time the alluvial materials, building out to sea, thus\r\ndiminish the slope of the stream. In the extreme old age of the river\r\nsystem the mountains are eaten down so that the torrent section\r\ndisappears, and the stream becomes of something like a uniform slope;\r\nthe higher alluvial plains gradually waste away, until in the end the\r\nvalley has no salient features. At this stage in the process, or even\r\nbefore it is attained, the valley is likely to be submerged beneath\r\nthe sea, where it is buried beneath the deposits formed on the floor;\r\nor a further uplift of the land may occur with the result that the\r\nstream is rejuvenated; or once more endowed with the power to create\r\ntorrents, build alluvial plains, and do the other interesting work of\r\na normal river.\r\n\r\nIt rarely, if ever, happens that a river valley attains old age before\r\nit has sunk beneath the sea or been refreshed by further upliftings.\r\nIn the unstable conditions of the continents, one or the other of\r\nthese processes, sometimes in different places both together, is apt\r\nto be going on. Thus if we take the case of the Mississippi and its\r\nprincipal tributaries, the Ohio and Missouri, we find that for many\r\ngeological ages the mountains about their sources have frequently, if\r\nnot constantly, grown upward, so that their torrent sections, though\r\nthey have worn down tens of thousands of feet, are still high above\r\nthe sea level, perhaps on the average as high as they have ever been.\r\nAt the same time the slight up-and-down swayings of the shore lands,\r\namounting in general to less than five hundred feet, have greatly\r\naffected the channels of the main river and its tributaries in their\r\nlower parts. Not long ago the Mississippi between Cairo and the Gulf\r\nflowed in a rather steep-sided valley probably some hundreds of feet\r\nin depth, which had a width of many miles. Then at the close of the\r\nlast Glacial period the region sank down so that the sea flooded the\r\nvalley to a point above the present junction of the Ohio River with\r\nthe main stream. Since then alluvial plains have filled this estuary\r\nto even beyond the original mouth. In many other of our Southern\r\nrivers, as along the shore from the Mississippi to the Hudson, the\r\nstreams have not brought in enough detritus to fill their drowned\r\nvalleys, which have now the name of bays, of which the Delaware and\r\nChesapeake on the Atlantic coast, and Mobile Bay on the Gulf of\r\nMexico, are good examples. The failure of Chesapeake and Delaware Bays\r\nto fill with _débris_ in the measure exhibited by the more southern\r\nvalleys is due to the fact that the streams which flow into them to a\r\ngreat extent drain from a region thickly covered with glacial waste, a\r\nmass which holds the flood waters, yielding the supply but slowly to\r\nthe torrents, which there have but a slight cutting power.\r\n\r\nIn our sketch of river valleys no attention has been given to the\r\nphenomena of waterfalls, those accidents of the flow which, as we have\r\nnoted, are particularly apt to characterize rivers which have not yet\r\ncut down to near the sea level. Where the normal uniform descent which\r\nis characteristic of a river's bed is interrupted by a sudden steep,\r\nthe fact always indicates the occurrence of one of a number of\r\ngeological actions. The commonest cause of waterfalls is due to a\r\nsudden change in the character of horizontal or at least nearly level\r\nbeds over which the stream may flow. Where after coursing for a\r\ndistance over a hard layer the stream comes to its edge and drops on a\r\nsoft or easily eroded stratum, it will cut this latter bed away, and\r\ncreate a more or less characteristic waterfall. Tumbling down the face\r\nof the hard layer, the stream acquires velocity; the _débris_ which it\r\nconveys is hurled against the bottom, and therefore cuts powerfully,\r\nwhile before, being only rubbed over the stone as it moved along, it\r\ncut but slightly. Masses of ice have the same effect as stones. Bits\r\ndropping from the ledge are often swept round and round by the eddies,\r\nso that they excavate an opening which prevents their chance escape.\r\nIn these confined spaces they work like augers, boring a deep,\r\nwell-like cavity. As the bits of stone wear out they are replaced by\r\nothers, which fall in from above. Working in this way, the fragments\r\noften develop regular well-like depressions, the cavities of which\r\nwork back under the cliffs, and by the undermining process deprive the\r\nface of the wall of its support, so that it tumbles in ruin to the\r\nbase, there to supply more material for the potholing action.\r\n\r\nWaterfalls of the type above described are by far the commonest of\r\nthose which occur out of the torrent districts of a great river\r\nsystem. That of Niagara is an excellent specimen of the type, which,\r\nthough rarely manifested in anything like the dignity of the great\r\nfall, is plentifully shown throughout the Mississippi Valley and the\r\nbasin of the Great Lakes. Within a hundred miles of Niagara there are\r\nat least a hundred small waterfalls of the same type. Probably three\r\nquarters of all the larger accidents of this nature are due to the\r\nconditions of a hard bed overlying softer strata.\r\n\r\nFalls are also produced in very many instances by dikes which cross\r\nthe stream. So, too, though rarely, only one striking instance being\r\nknown, an ancient coral reef which has become buried in strata may\r\nafford rock of such hardness that when the river comes to cross it it\r\nforms a cascade, as at the Falls of the Ohio, at Louisville, Ky. It is\r\na characteristic of all other falls, except those first mentioned,\r\nthat they rarely plunge with a clean downward leap over the face of a\r\nprecipice which recedes at its base, but move downward over an\r\nirregular sloping surface.\r\n\r\nIn the torrent district of rivers waterfalls are commonly very\r\nnumerous, and are generally due to the varying hardness in the rocks\r\nwhich the streams encounter. Here, where the cutting action is going\r\non with great rapidity, slight differences in the resistance which the\r\nrocks make to the work will lead to great variations in the form of\r\nthe bed over which they flow, while on the more gently sloping bottoms\r\nof the rivers, where the _débris_ moves slowly, such variations would\r\nbe unimportant in their effect. When the torrents escape into the main\r\nriver valleys, in regions where the great streams have cut deep\r\ngorges, they often descend from a great vertical height, forming\r\nwonderful waterfalls, such as those which occur in the famous\r\nLauterbrunnen Valley of Switzerland or in that of the Yosemite in\r\nCalifornia. This group of cascades is peculiar in that the steep of\r\nthe fall is made not by the stream itself, but by the action of a\r\ngreater river or of a glacier which may have some time taken its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWaterfalls have an economic as well as a picturesque interest in that\r\nthey afford sources of power which may be a very great advantage to\r\nmanufacturers. Thus along the Atlantic coast the streams which come\r\nfrom the Appalachian highlands, and which have hardly escaped from\r\ntheir torrent section before they attain the sea, afford numerous\r\ncataracts which have been developed so that they afford a vast amount\r\nof power. Between the James on the south and the Ste. Croix on the\r\nnorth more than a hundred of these Appalachian rivers have been turned\r\nto economic use. The industrial arts of this part of the country\r\ndepend much upon them for the power which drives their machinery. The\r\nwhole of the United States, because of the considerable size of its\r\nrivers and their relatively rapid fall, is richly endowed with this\r\nsource of energy, which, originating in the sun's heat and conveyed\r\nthrough the rain, may be made to serve the needs of man. In view of\r\nthe fact that recent inventions have made it possible to convert this\r\nenergy of falling water into the form of electricity, which may be\r\nconveyed to great distances, it seems likely that our rivers will in\r\nthe future be a great source of national wealth.\r\n\r\nWe must turn again to river valleys, there to trace certain actions\r\nless evident than those already noted, but of great importance in\r\ndetermining these features of the land. First, we have to note that in\r\nthe valley or region drained by a river there is another degrading or\r\ndown-wearing action than that which is accomplished by the direct work\r\nof the visible stream. All over such a valley the underground waters,\r\nsoaking through the soil and penetrating through the underlying rock,\r\nare constantly removing a portion of the mineral matter which they\r\ntake into solution and bear away to the sea. In this way, deprived of\r\na part of their substance, the rocks are continually settling down by\r\nunderwear throughout the whole basin, while they are locally being cut\r\ndown by the action of the stream. Hence in part it comes about that in\r\na river basin we find two contrasted features--the general and often\r\nslight slope of a country toward the main stream and its greater\r\ntributaries, and the sharp indentation of the gorge in which the\r\nstreams flow, these latter caused by the immediate and recent action\r\nof the streams.\r\n\r\nIf now the reader will conceive himself standing at any point in a\r\nriver basin, preferably beyond the realms of the torrents, he may with\r\nthe guidance of the facts previously noted, with a little use of the\r\nimagination, behold the vast perceptive which the history of the river\r\nvalley may unfold to him. He stands on the surface of the soil, that\r\n_débris_ of the rocks which is just entering on its way to the ocean.\r\nIn the same region ten thousand years ago he would have stood upon a\r\nsurface from one to ten feet higher than the present soil covering. A\r\nmillion years ago his station would have been perhaps five hundred\r\nfeet higher than the surface. Ten million years in the past, a period\r\nless than the lifetime of certain rivers, such as the French Broad\r\nRiver in North Carolina, the soil was probably five thousand feet or\r\nmore above its present plane. There are, indeed, cases where river\r\nvalleys appear to have worked down without interruption from the\r\nsubsidence of the land beneath the sea to the depth of at least two\r\nmiles. Looking upward through the space which the rocks once occupied,\r\nwe can conceive the action of the forces in their harmonious\r\nco-operation which have brought the surface slowly downward. We can\r\nimagine the ceaseless corrosion due to the ground water, bringing\r\nabout a constant though slow descent of the whole surface. Again and\r\nagain the streams, swinging to and fro under the guidance of the\r\nunderlying rock, or from the obstacles which the _débris_ they carried\r\nimposed upon them, have crossed the surface. Now and then perhaps the\r\nwearing was intensified by glacial action, for an ice sheet often cuts\r\nwith a speed many times as great as that which fluid water can\r\naccomplish. On the whole, this exercise of the constructive\r\nimagination in conceiving the history of a river valley is one of the\r\nmost enlarging tasks which the geologist can undertake.\r\n\r\nWhere in a river valley there are many lateral streams, and especially\r\nwhere the process of solution carried on by the underground waters is\r\nmost effective, as compared with erosive work done in the bed of the\r\nmain river, we commonly find the valley sloping gently toward its\r\ncentre, the rivers having but slight steeps near their banks. On the\r\nother hand, where, as occasionally happens, a considerable stream fed\r\nby the rain and snow fall in its torrent section courses for a great\r\ndistance over high, arid plains, on which the ground water and the\r\ntributaries do but little work, the basin may slope with very slight\r\ndeclivity to the river margins, and there descend to great depths,\r\nforming very deep gorges, of which the Colorado Cañon is the most\r\nperfect type. As instances of these contrasted conditions, we may\r\ntake, on the one hand, the upper Mississippi, where the grades toward\r\nthe main stream are gentle and the valley gorge but slightly\r\nexhibited; on the other, the above-mentioned Colorado, which bears a\r\ngreat tide of waters drawn from the high and relatively rainy region\r\nof the Rocky Mountains across the vast plateau lying in an almost\r\nrainless country. In this section nearly all the down-wearing has been\r\nbrought about in the direct path of the stream, which has worn the\r\nelevated plain into a deep gorge during the slow uprising of the\r\ntable-land to its present height. In this way a defile nearly a mile\r\nin depth has been created in a prevailingly rather flat country. This\r\ngorge has embranchments where the few great tributaries have done like\r\nwork, but, on the whole, this river flows in an almost unbroken\r\nchannel, the excavation of which has been due to its swift,\r\npebble-bearing waters.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of a newly formed river is to cut a more or less distinct\r\ncañon. As the basin becomes ancient, this element of the gorge tends\r\nto disappear, the reason for this being that, while the river bed is\r\nhigh above the sea, the current is swift and the down-cutting rapid,\r\nwhile the slow subsidence of the country on either side--a process\r\nwhich goes on at a uniform rate--causes the surface of that region to\r\nbe left behind in the race for the sea level. As the stream bed comes\r\nnearer the sea level its rate of descent is diminished, and so the\r\noutlying country gradually overtakes it.\r\n\r\nIn regions where the winters are very cold the effect of ice on the\r\ndevelopment of the stream beds both in the torrent and river sections\r\nof the valley is important. This work is accomplished in several\r\ndiverse ways. In the first place, where the stream is clear and the\r\ncurrent does not flow too swiftly, the stones on the bottom radiate\r\ntheir heat through the water, and thus form ice on their surfaces,\r\nwhich may attain considerable thickness. As ice is considerably\r\nlighter than water, the effect is often to lift up the stones of the\r\nbed if they be not too large; when thus detached from the bottom, they\r\nare easily floated down stream until the ice melts away. The ice which\r\nforms on the surface of the water likewise imprisons the pebbles along\r\nthe banks, and during the subsequent thaw may carry them hundreds of\r\nmiles toward the sea. It seems likely, from certain observations made\r\nby the writer, that considerable stones may thus be carried from the\r\nAlleghany River to the main Mississippi.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important effect of ice on river channels is\r\naccomplished when in a time of flood the ice field which covered the\r\nstream, perhaps to the depth of some feet, is broken up into vast\r\nfloes, which drift downward with the current. When, as on the Ohio,\r\nthese fields sometimes have the area of several hundred acres, they\r\noften collide with the shores, especially where the stream makes a\r\nsharp bend. Urged by their momentum, these ice floes pack into the\r\nsemblance of a dam, which may have a thickness of twenty, thirty, or\r\neven fifty feet. Beginning on the shore, where the collision takes\r\nplace, the dam may swiftly develop clear across the stream, so that in\r\na few minutes the way of the waters is completely blocked. The\r\non-coming ice shoots up upon the accumulation, increases its height,\r\nand extends it up stream, so that in an hour the mass completely bars\r\nthe current. The waters then heap up until they break their way over\r\nthe obstacle, washing its top away, until the whole is light enough\r\nto be forced down the stream, where, by the friction it encounters on\r\nthe bottom and sides of the channel, it is broken to pieces. It is\r\neasy to see that such moving dams of ice may sweep the bed of a river\r\nas with a great broom.\r\n\r\nSometimes where the gorges do not form a stationary dam large cakes of\r\nice become turned on edge and pack together so that they roll down the\r\nstream like great wheels, grinding the bed rock as they go.\r\n\r\nIn high northern countries, as in Siberia, the rivers, even the\r\ndeepest, often become so far frozen that their channels are entirely\r\nobstructed. Where, as in the case of these Siberian rivers, the flow\r\nis from south to north, it often happens that the spring thaw sets in\r\nbefore the more northern beds of the main stream are released from\r\ntheir bondage of frost. In this case the inundations have to find new\r\npaths on either side of the obstructed way. The result is a type of\r\nvalleys characterized by very irregular and changeable stream beds,\r\nthe rivers having no chance to organize themselves into the shapely\r\ncurves which they ordinarily follow.\r\n\r\nThe supply which finds its way to a river is composed, as has been\r\nalready incidentally noted, in part of the water which courses\r\nunderground for a greater or less distance before it emerges to the\r\nsurface, and in part of that which moves directly over the ground.\r\nThese two shares of water have somewhat different histories. On the\r\nshare of these two depends the stability of the flow. Where, as in New\r\nEngland and other glaciated countries, the surface of the earth is\r\ncovered with a thick layer of sand and gravel, which, except when\r\nfrozen, readily admits the water; the rainfall is to a very great\r\nextent absorbed by the earth, and only yielded slowly to the streams.\r\nIn these cases floods are rare and of no great destructive power.\r\nAgain, where also the river basin is covered by a dense mantle of\r\nforests, the ground beneath which is coated, as is the case in\r\nprimeval woods, with a layer of decomposing vegetation a foot or more\r\nin depth, this spongy mass retains the water even more effectively\r\nthan the open-textured glacial deposits above referred to. When the\r\nwoods, however, are removed from such an area, the rain may descend to\r\nthe streams almost as speedily as it finds its way to the gutters from\r\nthe house roofs. It thus comes about that all regions, when reduced to\r\ntillage, and where the rainfall is enough to maintain a good\r\nagriculture, are, except when they have a coating of glacial waste,\r\nexceedingly liable to destructive inundations.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, the risk of river floods is peculiarly great in all the\r\nregions of the United States lying much to the east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, except in the basin of the Great Lakes and in the district\r\nof New England, where the prevalence of glacial sands and gravels\r\naffords the protection which we have noted. Throughout this region the\r\nrainfall is heavy, and the larger part of it is apt to come after the\r\nground has become deeply snow-covered. The result is a succession of\r\ndevastating floods which already are very damaging to the works of\r\nman, and promise to become more destructive as time goes on. More than\r\nin any other country, we need the protection which forests can give us\r\nagainst these disastrous outgoings of our streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LAKES.\r\n\r\nIn considering the journey of water from the hilltops to the sea, we\r\nshould take some account of those pauses which it makes on its way\r\nwhen for a time it falls into the basin of a lake. These arrests in\r\nthe downward motion of water, which we term lakes, are exceedingly\r\nnumerous; their proper discussion would, indeed, require a\r\nconsiderable volume. We shall here note only the more important of\r\ntheir features, those which are of interest to the general student.\r\n\r\nThe first and most noteworthy difference in lakes is that which\r\nseparates the group of dead seas from the living basins of fresh\r\nwater. When a stream attains a place where its waters have to expand\r\ninto the lakelike form, the current moves in a slow manner, and the\r\nbroad surface exposed to the air permits a large amount of\r\nevaporation. If the basin be large in proportion to the amount of the\r\nincurrent water, this evaporation may exceed the supply, and produce a\r\nsea with no outlet, such as we find in the Dead Sea of Judea, in that\r\nat Salt Lake, Utah, and in a host of other less important basins. If\r\nthe rate of evaporation be yet greater in proportion to the flow, the\r\nlake may altogether dry away, and the river be evaporated before it\r\nattains the basin where it might accumulate. In that case the river is\r\nsaid to sink, but, in place of sinking into the earth, its waters\r\nreally rise into the air. Many such sinks occur in the central portion\r\nof the Rocky Mountain district. It is important to note that the\r\nprocess of evaporation we are describing takes place in the case of\r\nall lakes, though only here and there is the air so dry that the\r\nevaporation prevents the basin from overflowing at the lowest point on\r\nits rim, forming a river which goes thence to the sea. Even in the\r\ncase of the Great Lakes of North America a considerable part of the\r\nwater which flows into them does not go to the St. Lawrence and thence\r\nto the sea. As long as the lake finds an outlet to the sea its waters\r\ncontain but little more dissolved mineral matter than that we find in\r\nthe rivers. But because all water which has been in contact with the\r\nearth has some dissolved mineral substances, while that which goes\r\naway by evaporation is pure water, a lake without an outlet gradually\r\nbecomes so charged with these materials that it can hold no more in\r\nsolution, but proceeds to lay them down in deposits of that compound\r\nsubstance which from its principal ingredient we name salt. The water\r\nof dead seas, because of the additional weight of the substances which\r\nit holds, is extraordinarily buoyant. The swimmer notes a difference\r\nin this regard in the waters of rivers and fresh-water lakes and those\r\nof the sea, due to this same cause. But in those of dead seas,\r\nsaturated with saline materials, the human body can not sink as it\r\ndoes in the ordinary conditions of immersion. It is easy to understand\r\nhow the salt deposits which are mined in many parts of the world have\r\ngenerally, if not in all cases, been formed in such dead seas.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In some relatively rare cases salt deposits are formed in\r\nlagoons along the shores of arid lands, where the sea occasionally\r\nbreaks over the beach into the basin, affording waters which are\r\nevaporated, leaving their salt behind them.]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that almost all the known dead seas have in\r\nrecent geological times been living lakes--that is, they poured over\r\ntheir brims. In the Cordilleras from the line between Canada and the\r\nUnited States to central Mexico there are several of these basins. All\r\nof those which have been studied show by their old shore lines that\r\nthey were once brimful, and have only shrunk away in modern times.\r\nThese conditions point to the conclusion that the rainfall in\r\ndifferent regions varies greatly in the course of the geologic ages.\r\nFurther confirmation of this is found in the fact that very great salt\r\ndeposits exist on the coast of Louisiana and in northern\r\nEurope--regions in which the rainfall is now so great in proportion to\r\nthe evaporation that dead seas are impossible.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the question of how lake basins are formed, we note a\r\ngreat variety in the conditions which may bring about their\r\nconstruction. The greatest agent, or at least that which operates in\r\nthe construction of the largest basins, are the irregular movements of\r\nthe earth, due to the mountain-building forces. Where this work goes\r\non on a large scale, basin-shaped depressions are inevitably formed.\r\nIf all those which have existed remained, the large part of the lands\r\nwould be covered by them. In most cases, however, the cutting action\r\nof the streams has been sufficient to bring the drainage channels down\r\nto the bottom of the trough, while the influx of sediments has served\r\nto further the work by filling up the cavities. Thus at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous period there was a chain of lakes extending along the\r\neastern base of the Rocky Mountains, constituting fresh-water seas\r\nprobably as large as the so-called Great Lakes of North America. But\r\nthe rivers, by cutting down and tilling up, have long since\r\nobliterated these water areas. In other cases the tiltings of the\r\ncontinent, which sometimes oppose the flow of the streams, may for a\r\ntime convert the upper part of a river basin which originally sloped\r\ngently toward the sea into a cavity. Several cases of this description\r\noccurred in New England in the closing stages of the Glacial period,\r\nwhen the ground rose up to the northward.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that the basin of a dead sea becomes in\r\ncourse of time the seat of extensive salt deposits. These may, indeed,\r\nattain a thickness of many hundred feet. If now in the later history\r\nof the country the tract of land with the salt beneath it were\r\ntraversed by a stream, its underground waters may dissolve out the\r\nsalt and in a way restore the basin to its original unfilled\r\ncondition, though in the second state that of a living lake. It seems\r\nvery probable that a portion at least of the areas of Lakes Ontario,\r\nErie, and Huron may be due to this removal of ancient salt deposits,\r\nremains of which lie buried in the earth in the region bordering these\r\nbasins.\r\n\r\nBy far the commonest cause of lake basins is found in the\r\nirregularities of the surface which are produced by the occupation of\r\nthe country by glaciers. When these great sheets of ice lie over a\r\nland, they are in motion down the slopes on which they rest; they wear\r\nthe bed rocks in a vigorous manner, cutting them down in proportion to\r\ntheir hardness. As these rocks generally vary in the resistance which\r\nthey oppose to the ice, the result is that when the glacier passes\r\naway the surface no longer exhibits the continued down slope which the\r\nrivers develop, but is warped in a very complicated way. These\r\ndepressions afford natural basins in which lakes gather; they may vary\r\nin extent from a few square feet to many square miles. When a glacier\r\noccupies a country, the melting ice deposits on the surface of the\r\nearth a vast quantity of rocky _débris_, which was contained in its\r\nmass. This detritus is irregularly accumulated; in part it is disposed\r\nin the form of moraines or rude mounds made at the margin of the\r\nglacier, in part as an irregular sheet, now thick, now thin, which\r\ncovers the whole of the field over which the ice lay. The result of\r\nthis action is the formation of innumerable pools, which continue to\r\nexist until the streams have cut channels through which their waters\r\nmay drain away, or the basins have become filled with detritus\r\nimported from the surrounding country or by peat accumulations which\r\nthe plants form in such places.\r\n\r\nDoubtless more than nine tenths of all the lake basins, especially\r\nthose of small size, which exist in the world are due to\r\nirregularities of the land surface which are brought about by glacial\r\naction. Although the greater part of these small basins have been\r\nobliterated since the ice left this country, the number still\r\nremaining of sufficient size to be marked on a good map is\r\ninconceivably great. In North America alone there are probably over a\r\nhundred and fifty thousand of these glacial lakes, although by far the\r\ngreater part of those which existed when the glacial sheet disappeared\r\nhave been obliterated.\r\n\r\nYet another interesting group of fresh-water lakes, or rather we\r\nshould call them lakelets from their small size, owes its origin to\r\nthe curious underground excavations or caverns which are formed in\r\nlimestone countries. The water enters these caverns through what are\r\ntermed \"sink holes\"--basins in the surface which slope gently toward a\r\ncentral opening through which the water flows into the depths below.\r\nThe cups of the sink holes rarely exceed half a mile in diameter, and\r\nare usually much smaller. Their basins have been excavated by the\r\nsolvent and cutting actions of the rain water which gathers in them to\r\nbe discharged into the cavern below. It often happens that after a\r\nsink hole is formed some slight accident closes the downward-leading\r\nshaft, so that the basin holds water; thus in parts of the United\r\nStates there are thousands of these nearly circular pools, which in\r\ncertain districts, as in southern Kentucky, serve to vary the\r\nlandscape in much the same manner as the glacial lakes of more\r\nnorthern countries.\r\n\r\nSome of the most beautiful lakes in the world, though none more than a\r\nfew miles in diameter, occupy the craters of extinct volcanoes. When\r\nfor a time, or permanently, a volcano ceases to do its appointed work\r\nof pouring forth steam and molten rock from the depths of the earth,\r\nthe pit in the centre of the cone gathers the rain water, forming a\r\ndeep circular lake, which is walled round by the precipitous faces of\r\nthe crater. If the volcano reawakens, the water which blocks its\r\npassage may be blown out in a moment, the discharge spreading in some\r\ncases to a great distance from the cone, to be accumulated again when\r\nthe vent ceases to be open. The most beautiful of these volcanic lakes\r\nare to be found in the region to the north and south of Rome. The\r\noriginal seat of the Latin state was on the shores of one of these\r\ncrater pools, south of the Eternal City. Lago Bolsena, which lies to\r\nthe northward, and is one of the largest known basins of this nature,\r\nhaving a diameter of about eight miles, is a crater lake. The volcanic\r\ncone to which it belongs, though low, is of great size, showing that\r\nin its time of activity, which did not endure very long, this crater\r\nwas the seat of mighty ejections. The noblest specimen of this group\r\nof basins is found in Crater Lake, Oregon, now contained in one of the\r\nnational parks of the United States.\r\n\r\nInclosed bodies of water are formed in other ways than those\r\ndescribed; the list above given includes all the important classes of\r\naction which produce these interesting features. We should now note\r\nthe fact that, unlike the seas, the lakes are to be regarded as\r\ntemporary features in the physiography of the land. One and all, they\r\nendure for but brief geologic time, for the reason that the streams\r\nwork to destroy them by filling them with sediment and by carving out\r\nchannels through which their waters drain away. The nature of this\r\naction can well be conceived by considering what will take place in\r\nthe course of time in the Great Lakes of North America. As Niagara\r\nFalls cut back at the average rate of several feet a year, it will be\r\nbut a brief geologic period before they begin to lower the waters of\r\nLake Erie. It is very probable, indeed, that in twenty thousand years\r\nthe waters of that basin will be to a great extent drained away. When\r\nthis occurs, another fall or rapid will be produced in the channel\r\nwhich leads from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. This in turn will go through\r\nits process of retreat until the former expanse of waters disappears.\r\nThe action will then be continued at the outlets of Lakes Michigan and\r\nSuperior, and in time, but for the interposition of some actions which\r\nrecreate these basins, their floors will be converted into dry land.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that lakes owe in a manner the preservation\r\nof their basins to an action which they bring about on the waters that\r\nflow into them. These rivers or torrents commonly convey great\r\nquantities of sediment, which serve to rasp their beds and thus to\r\nlower their channels. In all but the smaller lakelets these turbid\r\nwaters lay down all their sediment before they attain the outlet of\r\nthe basin. Thus they flow away over the rim rock in a perfectly pure\r\nstate--a state in which, as we have noted before, water has no\r\ncapacity for abrading firm rock. Thus where the Niagara River passes\r\nfrom Lake Erie its clean water hardly affects the stone over which it\r\nflows. It only begins to do cutting work where it plunges down the\r\nprecipice of the Falls and sets in motion the fragments which are\r\nconstantly falling from that rocky face. These Falls could not have\r\nbegun as they did on the margin of Lake Ontario except for the fact\r\nthat when the Niagara River began to flow, as in relatively modern\r\ntimes, it found an old precipice on the margin of Lake Ontario, formed\r\nby the waves of the lake, down which the waters fell, and where they\r\nobtained cutting tools with which to undermine the steep which forms\r\nthe Falls.\r\n\r\nMany great lakes, particularly those which we have just been\r\nconsidering, have repeatedly changed their outlets, according as the\r\nsurface of the land on which they lie has swayed up and down in\r\nvarious directions, or as glacial sheets have barred or unbarred the\r\noriginal outlets of the basins. Thus in the Laurentian Lakes above\r\nOntario the geologist finds evidence that the drainage lines have\r\nagain and again been changed. For a time during the Glacial period,\r\nwhen Lake Ontario and the valley of the St. Lawrence was possessed by\r\nthe ice, the discharge was southward into the upper Mississippi or the\r\nOhio. At a later stage channels were formed leading from Georgian Bay\r\nto the eastern part of Ontario. Yet later, when the last-named lake\r\nwas bared, an ice dam appears to have remained in the St. Lawrence,\r\nwhich held back the waters to such a height that they discharged\r\nthrough the valley of the Mohawk into the Hudson. Furthermore, at some\r\ntime before the Glacial period, we do not know just when, there\r\nappears to have been an old Niagara River, now filled with drift,\r\nwhich ran from Lake Erie to Ontario, a different channel from that\r\noccupied by the present stream.\r\n\r\nThe effects of lakes on the river systems with which they are\r\nconnected is in many ways most important. Where they are of\r\nconsiderable extent, or where even small they are very numerous, they\r\nserve to retain the flood waters, delivering them slowly to the\r\nexcurrent streams. In rising one foot a lake may store away more water\r\nthan the river by its consequent rise at the point of outflow will\r\ncarry away in many months, and this for the simple reason that the\r\nlake may be many hundred or even thousand times as wide as the stream.\r\nMoreover, as before noted, the sediment gathered by the stream above\r\nthe level of the lake is deposited in its basin, and does not affect\r\nthe lower reaches of the river. The result is that great rivers, such\r\nas drain from the Laurentian Lakes, flow clear water, are exempt from\r\nfloods, are essentially without alluvial plains or terraces, and form\r\nno delta deposits. In all these features the St. Lawrence River\r\naffords a wonderful contrast to the Mississippi. Moreover, owing to\r\nthe clear waters, though it has flowed for a long time, it has never\r\nbeen able to cut away the slight obstructions which form its rapids,\r\nbarriers which probably would have been removed if its waters had been\r\ncharged with sediment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Muir Glacier, Alaska, showing crevasses and dust\r\nlayer on surface of ice._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                          GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that the water in the clouds is very\r\ncommonly in the frozen state; a large part of that fluid which is\r\nevaporated from the sea attains the solid form before it returns to\r\nthe earth. Nevertheless, in descending, at least nine tenths of the\r\nprecipitation returns to the fluid state, and does the kind of work\r\nwhich we have noted in our account of water. Where, however, the water\r\narrives on the earth in the frozen condition, it enters on a rôle\r\ntotally different from that followed by the fluid material.\r\n\r\nBeginning its descent to the earth in a snowflake, the little mass\r\nfalls slowly, so that when it comes against the earth the blow which\r\nit strikes is so slight that it does no effective work. In the state\r\nof snow, even in the separate flakes, the frozen water contains a\r\nrelatively large amount of air. It is this air indeed, which, by\r\ndividing the ice into many flakes that reflect the light, gives it the\r\nwhite colour. This important point can be demonstrated by breaking\r\ntransparent ice into small bits, when we perceive that it has the hue\r\nof snow. Much the same effect is given where glass is powdered, and\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nAs the snowflakes accumulate layer on layer they imbed air between\r\nthem, so that when the material falls in a feathery shape--say to the\r\ndepth of a foot--more than nine tenths of the mass is taken up by the\r\nair-containing spaces. As these cells are very small, the circulation\r\nin them is slight, and so the layer becomes an admirable\r\nnon-conductor, having this quality for the same reason that feathers\r\nhave it--i.e., because the cells are small enough to prevent the\r\ncirculation of the air, so that the heat which passes has to go by\r\nconduction, and all gases are very poor conductors. The result is that\r\na snow coating is in effect an admirable blanket. When the sun shines\r\nupon it, much of the heat is reflected, and as the temperature does\r\nnot penetrate it to any depth, only the superficial part is melted.\r\nThis molten water takes up in the process of melting a great deal of\r\nheat, so that when it trickles down into the mass it readily\r\nrefreezes. On the other hand, the heat going out from the earth, the\r\nstore accumulated in its superficial parts in the last warm season,\r\ntogether with the small share which flows out from the earth's\r\ninterior, is held in by this blanket, which it melts but slowly. Thus\r\nit comes about that in regions of long-enduring snowfall the ground,\r\nthough frozen to the depth of a foot or more at the time when the\r\naccumulation took place, may be thawed out and so far warmed that the\r\nvegetation begins to grow before the protecting envelope of snow has\r\nmelted away. Certain of the early flowers of high latitudes, indeed,\r\nbegin to blossom beneath the mantle of finely divided ice.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the earth which for the most part receive only a\r\ntemporary coating of snow the effect of this covering is\r\ninconsiderable. The snow water is yielded to the earth, from which it\r\nhas helped to withdraw the frost, so that in the springtime, the\r\ngrowing season of plants, the ground contains an ample store of\r\nmoisture for their development. Where the snowfall accumulates to a\r\ngreat thickness, especially where it lodges in forests, the influence\r\nof the icy covering is somewhat to protract the winter and thus to\r\nabbreviate the growing season.\r\n\r\nWhere snow rests upon a steep slope, and gathers to the depth of\r\nseveral feet, it begins to creep slowly down the declivity in a manner\r\nwhich we may often note on house roofs. This motion is favoured by the\r\ngradual though incomplete melting of the flakes as the heat\r\npenetrates the mass. Making a section through a mass of snow which has\r\naccumulated in many successive falls, we note that the top may still\r\nhave the flaky character, but that as we go down the flakes are\r\nreplaced by adherent shotlike bodies, which have arisen from the\r\npartial melting and gathering to their centres of the original\r\nexpanded crystalline bits. In this process of change the mass can move\r\nparticle by particle in the direction in which gravity impels it. The\r\nenergy of its motion, however, is slight, yet it can urge loose stones\r\nand forest waste down hill. Sometimes, as in the cemetery at Augusta,\r\nMe., where stone monuments or other structures, such as iron railings,\r\nare entangled in the moving mass, it may break them off and convey\r\nthem a little distance down the slope.\r\n\r\nSo long as the summer sun melts the winter's snow, even if the ground\r\nbe bare but for a day, the rôle of action accomplished by the snowfall\r\nis of little geological consequence. When it happens that a portion of\r\nthe deposit holds through the summer, the region enters on the glacial\r\nstate, and its conditions undergo a great revolution, the consequences\r\nof which are so momentous that we shall have to trace them in some\r\ndetail. Fortunately, the considerations which are necessary are not\r\nrecondite, and all the facts are of an extremely picturesque nature.\r\n\r\nTaking such a region as New England, where all the earth is\r\nlife-bearing in the summer season, and where the glacial period of the\r\nwinter continues but for a short time, we find that here and there on\r\nthe high mountains the snow endures throughout most of the summer, but\r\nthat all parts of the surface have a season when life springs into\r\nactivity. On the top of Mount Washington, in the White Mountains of\r\nNew Hampshire, in a cleft known as Tuckerman's Ravine, where the\r\ndeposit accumulates to a great depth, the snow-ice remains until\r\nmidsummer. It is, indeed, evident that a very slight change in the\r\nclimatal conditions of this locality would establish a permanent\r\naccumulation of frozen water upon the summit of the mountain. If the\r\ncrest were lifted a thousand feet higher, without any general change\r\nin the heat or rainfall of the district, this effect would be\r\nproduced. If with the same amount of rainfall as now comes to the\r\nearth in that region more of it fell as snow, a like condition would\r\nbe established. Furthermore, with an increase of rainfall to something\r\nlike double that which now descends the snow bore the same proportion\r\nto the precipitation which it does at present, we should almost\r\ncertainly have the peak above the permanent snow line, that level\r\nbelow which all the winter's fall melts away. These propositions are\r\nstated with some care, for the reason that the student should perceive\r\nhow delicate may be--indeed, commonly is--the balance of forces which\r\nmake the difference between a seasonal and a perennial snow covering.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the snow outlasts the summer, the region which it occupies\r\nis sterilized to life. From the time the snow begins to hold over the\r\nwarm period until it finally disappears, that field has to be reckoned\r\nout of the habitable earth, not only to man, but to the lowliest\r\norganisms.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In certain fields of permanent snow, particularly near their\r\nboundaries, some very lowly forms of vegetable life may develop on a\r\nfrozen surface, drawing their sustenance from the air, and supplied with\r\nwater by the melting which takes place during the summertime. These\r\nforms include the rare phenomenon termed red snow.]\r\n\r\nIf the snow in a glaciated region lay where it fell, the result would\r\nbe a constant elevation of the deposit year by year in proportion to\r\nthe annual excess of deposition over the melting or evaporation of the\r\nmaterial. But no sooner does the deposit attain any considerable\r\nthickness than it begins to move in the directions of least\r\nresistance, in accordance with laws which the students of glaciers are\r\njust beginning to discern. In small part this motion is accomplished\r\nby avalanches or snow slides, phenomena which are in a way important,\r\nand therefore merit description. Immediately after a heavy snowfall,\r\nin regions where the slopes are steep, it often happens that the\r\ndeposit which at first clung to the surface on which it lay becomes so\r\nheavy that it tends to slide down the slope; a trifling action, the\r\nslipping, indeed, of a single flake, may begin the movement, which at\r\nfirst is gradual and only involves a little of the snow. Gathering\r\nvelocity, and with the materials heaped together from the junction of\r\nthat already in motion with that about to be moved, the avalanche in\r\nsliding a few hundred feet down the slope may become a deep stream of\r\nsnow-ice, moving with great celerity. At this stage it begins to break\r\noff masses of ice from the glaciers over which it may flow, or even to\r\nmove large stones. Armed with these, it rends the underlying earth.\r\nAfter it has flowed a mile it may have taken up so much earth and\r\nmaterial that it appears like a river of mud. Owing to the fact that\r\nthe energy which bears it downward is through friction converted into\r\nheat, a partial melting of the mass may take place, which converts it\r\ninto what we call slush, or a mixture of snow and water. Finally, the\r\ntorrent is precipitated into the bottom of a valley, where in time the\r\nfrozen water melts away, leaving only the stony matter which it bore\r\nas a monument to show the termination of its flow.\r\n\r\nIt was the good fortune of the writer to see in the Swiss Oberland one\r\nvery great avalanche, which came from the high country through a\r\ndescent of several thousand feet to the surface of the Upper\r\nGrindelwald Glacier. The first sign of the action was a vague tremor\r\nof the air, like that of a great organ pipe when it begins to vibrate,\r\nbut before the pulsations come swiftly enough to make an audible note.\r\nIt was impossible to tell when this tremor came, but the wary guide,\r\nnoting it before his charge could perceive anything unusual, made\r\nhaste for the middle of the glacier. The vibration swelled to a roar,\r\nbut the seat of the sound amid the echoing cliffs was indeterminable.\r\nFinally, from a valley high up on the southern face of the glacier,\r\nthere leaped forth first a great stone, which sprang with successive\r\nrebounds to the floor of ice. Then in succession other stones and\r\nmasses of ice which had outrun the flood came thicker and thicker,\r\nuntil at the end of about thirty seconds the steep front of the\r\navalanche appeared like a swift-moving wall. Attaining the cliffs, it\r\nshot forth as a great cataract, which during the continuance of the\r\nflow--which lasted for several minutes--heaped a great mound of\r\ncommingled stones and ice upon the surface of the glacier. The mass\r\nthus brought down the steep was estimated at about three thousand\r\ncubic yards, of which probably the fiftieth part was rock material. An\r\navalanche of this volume is unusual, and the proportion of stony\r\nmatter borne down exceptionally great; but by these sudden motions of\r\nthe frozen water a large part of the snow deposited above the zone of\r\ncomplete melting is taken to the lower valleys, where it may disappear\r\nin the summer season, and much of the erosion accomplished in the\r\nmountains is brought about by these falls.\r\n\r\nIn all Alpine regions avalanches are among the most dreaded accidents.\r\nTheir occurrence, however, being dependent upon the shape of the\r\nsurface, it is generally possible to determine in an accurate way the\r\nliability of their happening in any particular field. The Swiss take\r\nprecaution to protect themselves from their ravages as other folk do\r\nto procure immunity from floods. Thus the authorities of many of the\r\nmountain hamlets maintain extensive forests on the sides of the\r\nvillages whence the downfall may be expected, experience having shown\r\nthat there is no other means so well calculated to break the blow\r\nwhich these great snowfalls can deliver, as thick-set trees which,\r\nthough they are broken down for some distance, gradually arrest the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nAs long as the region occupied by permanent snow is limited to sharp\r\nmountain peaks, relief by the precipitation of large masses to the\r\nlevel below the snow line is easily accomplished, but manifestly this\r\nkind of a discharge can only be effective from a very small field.\r\nWhere the relief is not brought about by these tumbles of snow,\r\nanother mode of gravitative action accomplishes the result, though in\r\na more roundabout way, through the mechanism of glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that the winter's snow upon our\r\nhillsides undergoes a movement in the direction of the slope. What we\r\nhave now to describe in a rather long story concerning glaciers rests\r\nupon movements of the same nature, though they are in certain features\r\npeculiarly dependent on the continuity of the action from year to\r\nyear. It is desirable, however, that the student should see that there\r\nis at the foundation no more mystery in glacial motion than there is\r\nin the gradual descent of the snow after it has lain a week on a\r\nhillside. It is only in the scale and continuity of the action that\r\nthe greatest glacial envelope exceeds those of our temporary\r\nwinters--in fact, whenever the snow falls the earth it covers enters\r\nupon an ice period which differs only in degree from that from which\r\nour hemisphere is just escaping.\r\n\r\nWhere the reader is so fortunate as to be able to visit a region of\r\nglaciers, he had best begin his study of their majestic phenomena by\r\nascending to those upper realms where the snow accumulates from year\r\nto year. He will there find the natural irregularities of the rock\r\nsurface in a measure evened over by a vast sheet of snow, from which\r\nonly the summits of the greater mountains rise. He may soon satisfy\r\nhimself that this sheet is of great depth, for here and there it is\r\nintersected by profound crevices. If the visit is made in the season\r\nwhen snow falls, which is commonly during most of the year, he may\r\nobserve, as before noted in our winter's snow, that the deposit,\r\nthough at first flaky, attains at a short distance below the surface a\r\nsomewhat granular character, though the shotlike grains fall apart\r\nwhen disturbed. Yet deeper, ordinarily a few feet below the surface,\r\nthese granules are more or less cemented together; the mass thus loses\r\nthe quality of snow, and begins to appear like a whitish ice. Looking\r\ndown one of the crevices, where the light penetrates to the depth of a\r\nhundred feet or more, he may see that the bluish hue somewhat\r\nincreases with the depth. A trace of this colour is often visible even\r\nin the surface snow on the glacier, and sometimes also in our ordinary\r\nwinter fields. In a hole made with a stick a foot or more in depth a\r\nfaint cerulean glimmer may generally be discerned; but the increased\r\nblueness of the ice as we go down is conspicuous, and readily leads us\r\nto the conclusion that the air, to which, as we before noted, the\r\nwhiteness of the snow is due, is working out of the mass as the\r\nprocess of compaction goes on. In a glacial district this snow mass\r\nabove the melting line is called the _névé_.\r\n\r\nRemembering that the excess of snow beyond the melting in a _névé_\r\ndistrict amounts, it may be, to some feet of material each year, we\r\neasily come to the conclusion that the mass works down the slope in\r\nthe manner which it does even where the coating is impermanent. This\r\nsupposition is easily confirmed: by observing the field we find that\r\nthe sheet is everywhere drawing away from the cliffs, leaving a deep\r\nfissure between the _névé_ and the precipices. This crevice is called\r\nby the German-Swiss guides the _Bergschrund_. Passage over it is\r\noften one of the most difficult feats to accomplish which the Alpine\r\nexplorer has to undertake. In fact, the very appearance of the\r\nsurface, which is that of a river with continuous down slopes, is\r\nsufficient evidence that the mass is slowly flowing toward the\r\nvalleys. Following it down, we almost always come to a place where it\r\npasses from the upper valleys to the deeper gorges which pierce the\r\nskirts of the mountain. In going over this projection the mass of\r\nsnow-ice breaks to pieces, forming a crowd of blocks which march down\r\nthe slope with much more speed than they journeyed when united in the\r\nhigher-lying fields. In this condition and in this part of the\r\nmovement the snow-ice forms what are called the _seracs_, or curds, as\r\nthe word means in the French-Swiss dialect. Slipping and tumbling\r\ndown the steep slope on which the _seracs_ develop, the ice becomes\r\nbroken into bits, often of small size. These fragments are quickly\r\nreknit into the body of ice, which we shall hereafter term the\r\nglacier, and in this process the expulsion of the air goes on more\r\nrapidly than before, and the mass assumes a more transparent icelike\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe action of the ice in the pressures and strains to which it is\r\nsubjected in joining the main glacier and in the further part of its\r\ncourse demand for their understanding a revision of those notions as\r\nto rigidity and plasticity which we derive from our common experience\r\nwith objects. It is hard to believe that ice can be moulded by\r\npressure into any shape without fracturing, provided the motion is\r\nslowly effected, while at the same time it is as brittle as ice to a\r\nsudden blow. We see, however, a similar instance of contrasted\r\nproperties in the confection known as molasses candy, a stick of which\r\nmay be indefinitely bent if the flexure is slowly made, but will fly\r\nto pieces like glass if sharply struck. Ice differs from the sugary\r\nsubstance in many ways; especially we should note that while it may be\r\nsqueezed into any form, it can not be drawn out, but fractures on the\r\napplication of a very slight tension. The conditions of its movement\r\nwe will inquire into further on, when we have seen more of its action.\r\n\r\nEntering on the lower part of its course, that where it flows into the\r\nregion below the snow line, the ice stream is now confined between the\r\nwalls of the valley, a channel which in most cases has been shaped\r\nbefore the ice time, by a mountain torrent, or perhaps by a slower\r\nflowing river. In this part of its course the likeness of a glacial\r\nstream to one of fluid water is manifest. We see that it twists with\r\nthe turn of the gorge, widens where the confining walls are far apart,\r\nand narrows where the space is constricted. Although the surface is\r\nhere and there broken by fractures, it is evident that the movement of\r\nthe frozen current, though slow, is tolerably free. By placing stakes\r\nin a row across the axis of a glacier, and observing their movement\r\nfrom day to day, or even from hour to hour if a good theodolite is\r\nused for the purpose, we note that the movement of the stream is\r\nfastest in the middle parts, as in the case of a river, and that it\r\nslows toward either shore, though it often happens, as in a stream of\r\nmolten water, that the speediest part of the current is near one side.\r\nFurther observations have indicated that the movement is most rapid on\r\nthe surface and least at the bottom, in which the stream is also\r\nriverlike. It is evident, in a word, that though the ice is not fluid\r\nin strict sense, the bits of which it is made up move in substantially\r\nthe manner of fluids--that is, they freely slip over each other. We\r\nwill now turn our attention to some important features of a detailed\r\nsort which glaciers exhibit.\r\n\r\nIf we visit a glacier during the part of the year when the winter\r\nsnows are upon it, it may appear to have a very uninterrupted surface.\r\nBut as the summer heat advances, the mask of the winter coating goes\r\naway, and we may then see the structure of the ice. First of all we\r\nnote in all valley glaciers such as we are observing that the stream\r\nis overlaid by a quantity of rocky waste, the greater part of which\r\nhas come down with the avalanches in the manner before described,\r\nthough a small part may have been worn from the bed over which the ice\r\nflows. In many glaciers, particularly as we approach their\r\ntermination, this sheet of earth and rock materials often covers the\r\nice so completely that the novice in such regions finds it difficult\r\nto believe that the ice is under his feet. If the explorer is minded\r\nto take the rough scramble, he can often walk for miles on these\r\nmasses of stone without seeing, much less setting foot on any frozen\r\nwater. In some of the Alaskan glaciers this coating may bear a forest\r\ngrowth. In general, this material, which is called moraine, is\r\ndistributed in bands parallel to the sides of the glaciers, and the\r\nstrips may amount to a half dozen or more. Those on the sides of the\r\nice have evidently been derived from the precipices which they have\r\npassed. Those in the middle have arisen from the union of the moraines\r\nformed in two or more tributary valleys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Map of glaciers and moraines near Mont Blanc.]\r\n\r\nWhere the avalanches fall most plentifully, the stones lie buried with\r\nthe snow, and only melt out when the stream attains the region where\r\nthe annual waste of its surface exceeds the snowfall. In this section\r\nwe can see how the progressive melting gradually brings the rocky\r\n_débris_ into plain view. Here and there we will find a boulder\r\nperched on a pedestal of ice, which indicates a recent down-wearing of\r\nthe field. A frequent sound in these regions arises from the tumble of\r\nthe stones from their pedestals or the slipping of the masses from the\r\nsharp ridge which is formed by the protection given to the ice through\r\nthe thick coating of detritus on its surface. These movements of the\r\nmoraines often distribute their waste over the glacier, so that in its\r\nlower part we can no longer trace the contributions from the several\r\nvalleys, the whole area being covered by the _débris_. At the end of\r\nthe ice stream, where its forward motion is finally overcome by the\r\nwarmth which it encounters, it leaves in a rude heap, extending often\r\nlike a wall across the valley, all the coarse fragments which it\r\nconveys. This accumulation, composed of all the lateral moraines which\r\nhave gathered on the ice by the fall of avalanches, is called the\r\nterminal moraine. As the ice stream itself shrinks, a portion of the\r\ndetritus next the boundary wall is apt to be left clinging against\r\nthose slopes. It is from the presence of these heaps in valleys now\r\nabandoned by glaciers that we obtain some information as to the former\r\ngreater extent of glacial action.\r\n\r\nThe next most noticeable feature is the crevasse. These fractures\r\noften exist in very great numbers, and constitute a formidable barrier\r\nin the explorer's way. The greater part of these ruptures below the\r\n_serac_ zone run from the sides of the stream toward the centre\r\nwithout attaining that region. These are commonly pointed up stream;\r\ntheir formation is due to the fact that, owing to the swifter motion\r\nin the central parts of the stream, the ice in that section draws away\r\nfrom the material which is moving more slowly next the shore. As\r\nbefore noted, these ice fractures when drawn out naturally form\r\nfissures at right angles to the direction of the strain. In the middle\r\nportions of the ice other fissures form, though more rarely, which\r\nappear to depend on local strains brought about through the\r\nirregularity of the surface over which the ice is flowing.\r\n\r\nIf the observer is fortunate, he may in his journey over the glacier\r\nhave a chance to see and hear what goes on when crevasses are formed.\r\nFirst he will hear a deep, booming sound beneath his feet, which\r\nmerges into a more splintering note as the crevice, which begins at\r\nthe bottom or in the distance, comes upward or toward him. When the\r\nsound is over, he may not be able to see a trace of the fracture,\r\nwhich at first is very narrow. But if the break intersect any of the\r\nnumerous shallow pools which in a warm summer's day are apt to cover a\r\nlarge part of the surface, he may note a line of bubbles rushing up\r\nthrough the water, marking the escape of the air from the glacier,\r\nsome remnant of that which is imprisoned in the original snow. Even\r\nwhere this indication is wanting, he can sometimes trace the crevice\r\nby the hissing sound of the air streams where they issue from the ice.\r\nIf he will take time to note what goes on, he can usually in an hour\r\nor two behold the first invisible crack widen until it may be half an\r\ninch across. He may see how the surface water hastens down the\r\nopening, a little river system being developed on the surface of the\r\nice as the streams make their way to one or more points of descent. In\r\ndoing this work they excavate a shaft which often becomes many feet in\r\ndiameter, down which their waters thunder to the base of the glacier.\r\nThis well-like opening is called a _moulin_, or mill, a name which, as\r\nwe shall see, is well deserved from the work which falling waters\r\naccomplish. Although the institution of the _moulin_ shaft depends\r\nupon the formation of a crevice, it often happens that as the ice\r\nmoves farther on its journey its walls are again thrust together,\r\nsoldered in the manner peculiar to ice, so that no trace of the\r\nrupture remains except the shaft which it permitted to form. Like\r\neverything else in the glacier, the _moulin_ slowly moves down the\r\nslope, and remains open as long as it is the seat of descending waters\r\nproduced by the summer melting. When it ceases to be kept open from\r\nthe summer, its walls are squeezed together in the fashion that the\r\ncrevices are closed.\r\n\r\nForming here and there, and generally in considerable numbers, the\r\ncrevices of a glacier entrap a good deal of the morainal _débris_,\r\nwhich falls through them to the bottom of the glacier. Smaller bits\r\nare washed into the _moulin_, by the streams arising from the melting\r\nice, which is brought about by the warm sun of the summer, and\r\nparticularly by the warm rains of that season. On those glaciers\r\nwhere, owing to the irregularity of the bottom over which the ice\r\nflows, these fractures are very numerous, it may happen that all the\r\ndetritus brought upon the surface of the glacier by avalanches finds\r\nits way to the floor of the ice.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is difficult to learn what is going on at the under\r\nsurface of the glacier, it is possible directly and indirectly to\r\nascertain much concerning the peculiar and important work which is\r\nthere done. The intrepid explorer may work his way in through the\r\nlateral fissures, and even with care safely descend some of the\r\nfissures which penetrate the central parts of a shallow ice stream.\r\nThere, it may be at the depth of a hundred feet or more, he will find\r\na quantity of stones, some of which may be in size like to a small\r\nhouse held in the body of the ice, but with one side resting upon the\r\nbed rock. He may be so fortunate as to see the stone actually in\r\nprocess of cutting a groove in the bed rock as it is urged forward by\r\nthe motion of the glacier. The cutting is not altogether in the fixed\r\nmaterial, for the boulder itself is also worn and scored in the work.\r\nSmaller pebbles are caught in the space between the erratic and the\r\nmotionless rock and ground to bits. If in his explorations the student\r\nfinds his way to the part of the floor on which the waters of a\r\n_moulin_ fall, he may have a chance to observe how the stones set in\r\nmotion serve to cut the bed rock, forming elongated potholes much as\r\nin the case of ordinary waterfalls, or at the base of those shafts\r\nwhich afford the beginnings of limestone caverns.\r\n\r\nThe best way to penetrate beneath the glacier is through the arch of\r\nthe stream which always flows from the terminal face of the ice river.\r\nEven in winter time every large glacier discharges at its end a\r\nconsiderable brook, the waters of which have been melted from the ice\r\nin small part by the outflow of the earth's heat; mainly, however, by\r\nthe warmth produced in the friction of the ice on itself and on its\r\nbottom--in other words, by the conversion of that energy of position,\r\nof which we have often to speak, into heat. In the summer time this\r\nsubglacial stream is swollen by the surface waters descending through\r\nthe crevices and the _moulins_ which come from them, so that the\r\noutflow often forms a considerable river, and thus excavates in the\r\nice a large or at least a long cavern, the base of which is the bed\r\nrock. In the autumn, when the superficial melting ceases, this gallery\r\ncan often be penetrated for a considerable distance, and affords an\r\nexcellent way to the secrets of the under ice. The observer may here\r\nsee quantities of the rock material held in the grip of the ice, and\r\nforced to a rude journey over the bare foundation stones. Now and then\r\nhe may find the glacial mass in large measure made up of stones, the\r\nadmixture extending many feet above the bottom of the cavern, perhaps\r\nto the very top of the arch. He may perchance find that these stones\r\nare crushing each other where they are in contact. The result will be\r\nbrought about by the difference in the rate of advance of the ice,\r\nwhich moves the faster the higher it is above the surface over which\r\nit drags, and thus forces the stones on one level over those below.\r\nWhere the waters of the subglacial stream have swept the bed rock\r\nclean of _débris_ its surface is scored, grooved, and here and there\r\npolished in a manner which is accomplished only by ice action, though\r\nsome likeness to it is afforded where stones have been swept over for\r\nages by blowing sand. Here and there, often in a way which interrupts\r\nthe cavern journey, the shrunken stream, unable to carry forward the\r\n_débris_, deposits the material in the chamber, sometimes filling the\r\narch so completely that the waters are forced to make a detour. This\r\naction is particularly interesting, for the reason that in regions\r\nwhence glaciers have disappeared the deposits formed in the old ice\r\narches often afford singularly perfect moulds of those caverns which\r\nwere produced by the ancient subglacial streams. These moulds are\r\ntermed _eskers_.\r\n\r\nIf the observer be attentive, he will note the fact that the waters\r\nemerging from beneath the considerable glacier are very much charged\r\nwith mud. If he will take a glass of the water at the point of escape,\r\nhe will often find, on permitting it to settle, that the sediment\r\namounts to as much as one twentieth of the volume. While the greater\r\npart of this detritus will descend to the bottom of the vessel in the\r\ncourse of a day, a portion of it does not thus fall. He may also note\r\nthat this mud is not of the yellowish hue which he is accustomed to\r\nbehold in the materials laid down by ordinary rivers, but has a\r\nwhitish colour. Further study will reveal the fact that the difference\r\nis due to the lack of oxidation in the case of the glacial detritus.\r\nRiver muds forming slowly and during long-continued exposure to the\r\naction of the air have their contained iron much oxidized, which gives\r\nthem a part of their darkened appearance. Moreover, they are somewhat\r\ncoloured with decayed vegetable matter. The waste from beneath the\r\nglacier has been quickly separated from the bed rock, all the faces of\r\nthe grains are freshly fractured, and there is no admixture of organic\r\nmatter. The faces of the particles thus reflect light in substantially\r\nthe same way as powdered glass or pulverized ice, and consequently\r\nappear white.\r\n\r\nA little observation will show the student that this very muddy\r\ncharacter of waters emerging from beneath the glacier is essentially\r\npeculiar to such streams as we have described. Ascending any of the\r\nprincipal valleys of Switzerland, he may note that some of the streams\r\nflow waters which carry little sediment even in times when they are\r\nmuch swollen, while others at all seasons have the whitish colour. A\r\nlittle further exploration, or the use of a good map, will show him\r\nthat the pellucid streams receive no contributions of glacial water,\r\nwhile those which look as if they were charged with milk come, in part\r\nat least, from the ice arches. From some studies which the writer has\r\nmade in Swiss valleys, it appears that the amount of erosion\r\naccomplished on equal areas of similar rock by the descent of the\r\nwaters in the form of a glacier or in that of ordinary torrents\r\ndiffers greatly. Moving in the form of ice, or in the state of\r\nice-confined streams, the mass of water applies very many times as\r\nmuch of its energy of position to grinding and bearing away the rocks\r\nas is accomplished where the water descends in its fluid state.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the intense ice action above noted is rapidly to wear\r\naway the rocks of the valley in which the glacier is situated. This\r\nwork is done not only in a larger measure but in a different way from\r\nthat accomplished by torrents. In the case of the latter, the stream\r\nbed is embarrassed by the rubbish which comes into it; only here and\r\nthere can it attack the bed rock by forcing the stones over its\r\nsurface. Only in a few days of heavy rain each year is its work at all\r\neffective; the greater part of the energy of position of its waters is\r\nexpended in the endless twistings and turnings of its stream, which\r\nresult only in the development of heat which flies away into the\r\natmosphere. In the ice stream, owing to its slow movement and to the\r\ndetritus which it forces along the bottom, a vastly greater part of\r\nthe energy which impels it down the slope is applied to rock cutting.\r\nNone of the boulders, even if they are yards in diameter, obstruct its\r\nmotion; small and great alike are to it good instruments wherewith to\r\nattack the bed rocks. The fragments are never left to waste by\r\natmospheric decay, but are to a very great extent used up in\r\nmechanical work, while the most of the detritus which comes to a\r\ntorrent is left in a coarse state when it is delivered to the stream;\r\nthe larger part of that which the glacier transports is worn out in\r\nits journey. To a great extent it is used up in attacking the bed\r\nrock. In most cases the _débris_ in the terminal moraine is evidently\r\nbut a small part of what entered the ice during its journey from the\r\nuplands; the greater part has been worn out in the rude experiences to\r\nwhich it has been subjected.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that even in the regions now most extensively occupied\r\nby glaciers the drainage systems have been shaped by the movement of\r\nordinary streams--in other words, ice action is almost everywhere,\r\neven in the regions about the poles, an incidental feature in the work\r\nof water, coming in only to modify the topography, which is mainly\r\nmoulded by the action of fluid water. When, owing to climatal changes,\r\na valley such as those of the Alps is occupied by a glacial stream,\r\nthe new current proceeds at once, according to its evident needs, to\r\nmodify the shape of its channel. An ordinary torrent, because of the\r\nswiftness of its motion, which may, in general, be estimated at from\r\nthree to five miles an hour, can convey away the precipitation over a\r\nvery narrow bed. Therefore its channel is usually not a hundredth part\r\nas wide as the gorge or valley in which it lies. But when the\r\ndischarge takes place by a glacier, the speed of which rarely exceeds\r\nfour or five feet a day, the ice stream because of its slow motion has\r\nto fill the trough from side to side, it has to be some thousand times\r\nas deep and wide as the torrent. The result is that as soon as the\r\nglacial condition arises in a country the ice streams proceed to\r\nchange the old V-shaped torrent beds into those which have a broad\r\nU-like form. The practised eye can in a way judge how long a valley\r\nhas been subjected to glacial action by the extent to which it has\r\nbeen widened by this process.\r\n\r\nIn the valleys of Switzerland and other mountain districts which have\r\nbeen attentively studied it is evident that glacial action has played\r\na considerable part in determining their forms. But the work has been\r\nlimited to that part of the basin in which the ice is abundantly\r\nprovided with cutting tools in the stone which have found their way to\r\nthe base of the stream. In the region of the _névé_, where the\r\ncontributions of rocky matter to the surface of the deposit made from\r\nthe few bare cliffs which rise above the sheet of snow is small, the\r\nsnow-ice does no cutting of any consequence. Where it passes over the\r\nsteep at the head of the deep valley into which it drains, and is\r\nriven into the _seracs_, such stony matter as it may have gathered is\r\nallowed to fall to the bottom, and so comes into a position where it\r\nmay do effective work. From this _serac_ section downward the now\r\ndistinct ice river, being in general below the snow line, has\r\neverywhere cliffs, on either side from which the contributions of rock\r\nmaterial are abundant. Hence this part of the glacier, though it is\r\nthe wasting portion of its length, does all the cutting work of any\r\nconsequence which is performed. It is there that the underrunning\r\nstreams become charged with sediment, which, as we have noted, they\r\nbear in surprising quantities, and it is therefore in this section of\r\nthe valley that the impress of the ice work is the strongest. Its\r\neffect is not only to widen the valley and deepen it, but also to\r\nadvance the deep section farther up the stream and its tributaries.\r\nThe step in the stream beds which we find at the _seracs_ appears to\r\nmark the point in the course of the glacier where, owing to the\r\nfalling of stones to its base, as well as to its swifter movements and\r\nthe firmer state of the ice, it does effective wearing.\r\n\r\nThere are many other features connected with glaciers which richly\r\nrepay the study of those who have a mind to explore in the manner of\r\nthe physicist interested in ice actions the difficult problems which\r\nthey afford; but as these matters are not important from the point of\r\nview of this work, no mention of them will here be made. We will now\r\nturn our attention to that other group of glaciers commonly termed\r\ncontinental, which now exist about either pole, and which at various\r\ntimes in the earth's history have extended far toward the equator,\r\nmantling over vast extents of land and shallow sea. The difference\r\nbetween the ice streams of the mountains and those which we term\r\ncontinental depends solely on the areas of the fields and the depth of\r\nthe accumulation. In an ordinary Alpine region the _névé_ districts,\r\nwhere the snow gathers, are relatively small. Owing to the rather\r\nsteep slopes, the frozen water is rapidly discharged into the lower\r\nvalleys, where it melts away. Both in the _névé_ and in the distinct\r\nglacier of the lower grounds there are, particularly in the latter,\r\nprojecting peaks, from which quantities of stone are brought down by\r\navalanches or in ordinary rock falls, so that the ice is abundantly\r\nsupplied with cutting tools, which work from its surface down to its\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nAs the glacial accumulation grows in depth there are fewer peaks\r\nemerging from it, and the streams which it feeds rise the higher until\r\nthey mantle over the divides between the valleys. Thus by\r\nimperceptible stages valley glaciers pass to the larger form, usually\r\nbut incorrectly termed continental. We can, indeed, in going from the\r\nmountains in the tropics to the poles, note every step in this\r\ntransition, until in Greenland we attain the greatest ice mass in the\r\nworld, unless that about the southern pole be more extensive. In the\r\nGreenland glacier the ice sheet covers a vast extent of what is\r\nprobably a mountain country, which is certainly of this nature in the\r\nsouthern part of the island, where alone we find portions of the earth\r\nnot completely covered by the deep envelope. Thanks to the labours of\r\ncertain hardy explorers, among whom Nansen deserves the foremost\r\nplace, we now know something as to the conditions of this vast ice\r\nfield, for it has been crossed from shore to shore. The results of\r\nthese studies are most interesting, for they afford us a clew as to\r\nthe conditions which prevail over a large part of the earth during the\r\nGlacial period from which the planet is just escaping, and in the\r\nearlier ages when glaciation was likewise extensive. We shall\r\ntherefore consider in a somewhat detailed way the features which the\r\nGreenland glacier presents.\r\n\r\nStarting from the eastern shore of that land, if we may thus term a\r\nregion which presents itself mainly in the form of ice, we find next\r\nthe shore a coast line not completely covered with ice and snow, but\r\nhere and there exhibiting peaks which indicate that if the frozen\r\nmantle were removed the country would appear deeply intersected with\r\nfiords in the manner exhibited in the regions to the south of\r\nGreenland or the Scandinavian peninsula. The ice comes down to the\r\nsea through the valleys, often facing the ocean for great distances\r\nwith its frozen cliffs. Entering on this seaward portion of the\r\nglacier, the observer finds that for some distance from the coast line\r\nthe ice is more or less rifted with crevices, the formation of which\r\nis doubtless due to irregularities of the rock bottom over which it\r\nmoves. These ruptures are so frequent that for some miles back it is\r\nvery difficult to find a safe way. Finally, however, a point is\r\nattained where these breaks rather suddenly disappear, and thence\r\ninward the ice rises at the rate of upward slope of a few feet to the\r\nmile in a broad, nearly smooth incline. In the central portion of the\r\nregion for a considerable part of the territory the ice has very\r\nlittle slope. Thence it declines toward the other shore, exhibiting\r\nthe same features as were found on the eastern versant until near the\r\ncoast, when again the surface is beset with crevices which continue to\r\nthe margin of the sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough the explorations of the central field of Greenland are as yet\r\nincomplete, several of these excursions into or across the interior\r\nhave been made, and the identity of the observations is such that we\r\ncan safely assume the whole region to be of one type. We can\r\nfurthermore run no risk in assuming that what we find in Greenland, at\r\nleast so far as the unbroken nature of the central ice field is\r\nconcerned, is what must exist in every land where the glacial envelope\r\nbecomes very deep. In Greenland it seems likely that the depth of the\r\nice is on the average more than half a mile, and in the central part\r\nof the realm the sheet may well have a much greater profundity; it may\r\nbe nearly a mile deep. The most striking feature--that of a vast\r\nunbroken expanse, bordered by a region where the ice is ruptured--is\r\ntraceable wherever very extensive and presumably deep deposits of ice\r\nhave been examined. As we shall see hereafter, these features teach us\r\nmuch as to the conditions of glacial action--a matter which we shall\r\nhave to examine after we have completed our general survey as to the\r\nchanges which occur during glacial periods.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of that wonderful complex of actions which we\r\nterm climate, glaciers are everywhere, so far as our observations\r\nenable us to judge, generally in process of decrease. In Switzerland,\r\nalthough the ancients even in Roman days were in contact with the ice,\r\nthey were so unobservant that they did not even remark that the ice\r\nwas in motion. Only during the last two centuries have we any\r\nobservations of a historic sort which are of value to the geologist.\r\nFortunately, however, the signs written on the rock tell the story,\r\nexcept for its measurement in terms of years, as clearly as any\r\nrecords could give it. From this testimony of the rocks we perceive\r\nthat in the geological yesterday, though it may have been some tens of\r\nthousands of years ago, the Swiss glaciers, vastly thickened, and with\r\ntheir horizontal area immensely expanded, stretched over the Alpine\r\ncountry, so that only here and there did any of the sharper peaks rise\r\nabove the surface. These vast glaciers, almost continually united on\r\ntheir margins, extended so far that every portion of what is now the\r\nSwiss Republic was covered by them. Their front lay on the southern\r\nlowlands of Germany, on the Jura district of France; on the south, it\r\nstretched across the valley of the Po as far as near Milan. We know\r\nthis old ice front by the accumulations of rock _débris_ which were\r\nbrought to it from the interior of the mountain realm. We can\r\nrecognise the peculiar kinds of stone, and with perfect certainty\r\ntrace them to the bed rock whence they were riven. Moreover, we can\r\nfollow back through the same evidence the stages of retreat of the\r\nglaciers, until they lost their broad continental character and\r\nassumed something like their present valley form. Up the valley of any\r\nof the great rivers, as, for instance, that of the Rhône above the\r\nlake of Geneva, we note successive terminal moraines which clearly\r\nindicate stages in the retreat of the ice when for a time it ceased to\r\ngo backward, or even made a slight temporary readvance. It is easily\r\nseen that on such occasions the stones carried to the ice front would\r\nbe accumulated in a heap, while during the time when day by day the\r\nglacier was retreating the rock waste would be left broadcast over the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nAs we go up from the course of the glacial streams we note that the\r\nsuccessive moraines have their materials in a progressively less\r\ndecayed state. Far away from the heap now forming, and in proportion\r\nto the distance, the stones have in a measure rotted, and the heaps\r\nwhich they compose are often covered with soil and occupied by\r\nforests. Within a few miles of the ice front the stones still have a\r\nfresh aspect. When we arrive within, say, half a mile of the moraine\r\nnow building, we come to the part of the glacial retreat of which we\r\nhave some written or traditional account. This is in general to the\r\neffect that the wasting of the glaciers is going on in this century as\r\nit went on in the past. Occasionally periods of heavy snow would\r\nrefresh the ice streams, so that for a little time they pushed their\r\nfronts farther down the valley. The writer has seen during one of\r\nthese temporary advances the interesting spectacle of ice destroying\r\nand overturning the soil of a small field which had been planted in\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that these temporary advances of the ice are not\r\ndue to the snowfall of the winter or winters immediately preceding the\r\nforward movement. So slow is the journey of the ice from the _névé_\r\nfield to the end of a long glacier that it may require centuries for\r\nthe store accumulated in the uplands to affect the terminal portion of\r\nthe stream. We know that the bodies of the unhappy men who have been\r\nlost in the crevices of the glacier are borne forward at a uniform and\r\ntolerably computable rate until they emerge at the front, where the\r\nice melts away. In at least one case the remains have appeared after\r\nmany years in the _débris_ which is contributed to the moraine. On\r\naccount of this slow feeding of the glacial stream, we naturally may\r\nexpect to find, as we do, in fact, that a great snowfall of many\r\nyears ago, and likewise a period when the winter's contribution has\r\nbeen slight, would influence the position of the terminal point of the\r\nice stream at different times, according to its length. If the length\r\nof the flow be five miles, it may require twenty or thirty years for\r\nthe effect to be evident; while if the stream be ten miles long, the\r\ninfluence may not be noted in less than threescore years. Thus it\r\ncomes about that at the present time in the same glacial district some\r\nstreams may be advancing while others are receding, though, on the\r\nwhole, the ice is generally in process of shrinkage. If the present\r\nrate of retreat should be maintained, it seems certain that at the end\r\nof three centuries the Swiss glaciers as a whole will not have\r\nanything like their present area, and many of the smaller streams will\r\nentirely disappear.\r\n\r\nFollowing the method of the illustrious Louis Agassiz, who first\r\nattentively traced the evidence which shows the geologically recent\r\ngreat extension of glaciers by studying the evidence of the action in\r\nfields they no longer occupy, geologists have now inspected a large\r\npart of the land areas with a view to finding the proofs of such ice\r\nwork. So far as these indications are concerned, the indications which\r\nthey have had to trace are generally of a very unmistakable character.\r\nRarely, indeed, does a skilled student of such phenomena have to\r\nsearch in any region for more than a day before he obtains indubitable\r\nevidence which will enable him to determine whether or not the field\r\nhas recently been occupied by an enduring ice sheet--one which\r\nsurvives the summer season and therefore deserves the name of glacier.\r\nThe indications which he has to consider consist in the direction and\r\nmanner in which the surface materials have been carried, the physical\r\nconditions of these materials, the shape of the surface of the\r\nunderlying rock as regards its general contour, and the presence or\r\nabsence of scratches and groovings on its surface. As these records of\r\nice action are of first importance in dealing with this problem, and\r\nas they afford excellent subjects for the study of those who dwell in\r\nglaciated regions, we shall note them in some detail.\r\n\r\nThe geologist recognises several ways in which materials may be\r\ntransported on the surface of the earth. They may be cast forth by\r\nvolcanoes, making their journey by being shot through the air, or by\r\nflowing in lava streams; it is always easy at a glance, save in very\r\nrare instances, to determine whether fragments have thus been\r\nconveyed. Again, the detritus may be moved by the wind; this action is\r\nlimited; it only affects dust, sand, and very small pebbles, and is\r\neasily discriminated. The carriage may be effected by river or marine\r\ncurrents; here, again, the size of the fragments moved is small, and\r\nthe order of their arrangement distinctly traceable. The fragments may\r\nbe conveyed by ice rafts; here, too, the observer can usually limit\r\nthe probabilities he has to consider by ascertaining, as he can\r\ngenerally do, whether the region which he is observing has been below\r\na sea or lake. In a word, the before-mentioned agents of\r\ntransportation are of somewhat exceptional influence, and in most\r\ncases can, as explanations of rock transportation, be readily\r\nexcluded. When, therefore, the geologist finds a country abundantly\r\ncovered with sand, pebbles, and boulders arranged in an irregular way,\r\nhe has generally only to inquire whether the material has been carried\r\nby rivers or by glaciers. This discrimination can be quickly and\r\ncritically effected. In the first place, he notes that rivers only in\r\ntheir torrent sections can carry large fragments of rock, and that in\r\nall cases the fragments move down hill. Further, that where deposits\r\nare formed, they have more or less the form of alluvial deposits. If\r\nnow the observations show that the rock waste occupying the surface of\r\nany region has been carried up hill and down, across the valleys,\r\nparticularly if there are here and there traces of frontal moraines,\r\nthe geologist is entitled to suppose--he may, indeed, be sure--that\r\nthe carriage has been effected by a glacial sheet.\r\n\r\nImportant corroborative evidence of ice action is generally to be\r\nfound by inspecting the bed rock below the detritus, which indicates\r\nglacial action. Even if it be somewhat decayed, as is apt to be the\r\ncase where the ice sheet long since passed away, the bed rock is\r\nlikely to have a warped surface; it is cast into ridges and furrows of\r\na broad, flowing aspect, such as liquid water never produces, which,\r\nindeed, can only be created by an ice sheet moving over the surface,\r\ncutting its bed in proportion to the hardness of the material.\r\nFurthermore, if the bed rock have a firm texture, and be not too much\r\ndecayed, we almost always find upon it grooves or scratches, channels\r\ncarved by the stones embedded in the body of the ice, and drawn by its\r\nmotion over the fixed material. Thus the proof of glacial extension in\r\nthe last ice epoch is made so clear that accurate maps can be prepared\r\nshowing the realm of its action. This task is as yet incomplete,\r\nalthough it is already far advanced.\r\n\r\nWhile the study of glaciers began in Europe, inquiries concerning\r\ntheir ancient extension have been carried further and with more\r\naccuracy in North America than in any other part of the world. We may\r\ntherefore well begin our description of the limits of the ice sheets\r\nwith this continent. Imagining a seafarer to have approached America\r\nby the North Atlantic, as did the Scandinavians, and that his voyage\r\ncame perhaps a hundred thousand years or more before that of Leif\r\nEricsson, he would have found an ice front long before he attained the\r\npresent shores of the land. This front may have extended from south of\r\nGreenland, off the shores of the present Grand Banks of Newfoundland,\r\nthence and westward to central or southern New Jersey. This cliff of\r\nice was formed by a sheet which lay on the bottom of the sea. On the\r\nNew Jersey coast the ice wall left the sea and entered on the body of\r\nthe continent. We will now suppose that the explorer, animated with\r\nthe valiant scientific spirit which leads the men of our day to seek\r\nthe poles, undertook a land journey along the ice front across the\r\ncontinent. From the New Jersey coast the traveller would have passed\r\nthrough central Pennsylvania, where, although there probably detached\r\noutlying glaciers lying to the southward as far as central Virginia,\r\nthe main front extended westward into the Ohio Valley. In southern\r\nOhio a tongue of the ice projected southwardly until it crossed the\r\nOhio River, where Cincinnati now lies, extending a few miles to the\r\nsouthward of the stream. Thence it deflected northwardly, crossing the\r\nMississippi, and again the Missouri, with a tongue or lobe which went\r\nfar southward in that State. Then again turning to the northwest, it\r\nfollowed in general the northern part of the Missouri basin until it\r\ncame to within sight of the Rocky Mountains. There the ice front of\r\nthe main glacier followed the trend of the mountains at some distance\r\nfrom their face for an unknown extent to the northward. In the\r\nCordilleras, as far south as southern Colorado, and probably in the\r\nSierra Nevada to south of San Francisco, the mountain centres\r\ndeveloped local glaciers, which in some places were of very great\r\nsize, perhaps exceeding any of those which now exist in Switzerland.\r\nIt will thus be seen that nearly one half of the present land area of\r\nNorth America was beneath a glacial covering, though, as before noted,\r\nthe region about the Gulf of Mexico may have swayed upward when the\r\nnorthern portion of the land was borne down by the vast load of ice\r\nwhich rested upon it. Notwithstanding this possible addition to the\r\nland, our imaginary explorer would have found the portion of the\r\ncontinent fit for the occupancy of life not more than half as great as\r\nit is at present.\r\n\r\nIn the Eurasian continent there was no such continuous ice sheet as in\r\nNorth America, but the glaciers developed from a number of different\r\ncentres, each moving out upon the lowlands, or, if its position was\r\nsouthern, being limited to a particular mountain field. One of these\r\ncentres included Scandinavia, northern Germany, Great Britain about as\r\nfar south as London, and a large part of Ireland, the ice covering the\r\nintermediate seas and extending to the westward, so that the passage\r\nof the North Atlantic was greatly restricted between this ice front\r\nand that of North America. Another centre, before noted, was formed in\r\nthe Alps; yet another, of considerable area, in the Pyrenees; other\r\nless studied fields existed in the Apennines, in the Caucasus, the\r\nUral, and the other mountains of northern Asia. Curiously enough,\r\nhowever, the great region of plains in Siberia does not appear to have\r\nbeen occupied by a continuous ice sheet, though the similar region in\r\nNorth America was deeply embedded in a glacier. Coincident with this\r\ndevelopment of ice in the eastern part of the continent, the ice\r\nstreams of the Himalayan Mountains, some of which are among the\r\ngreatest of our upland glaciers, appear to have undergone but a\r\nmoderate extension. Many other of the Eurasian highlands were probably\r\nice-bound during the last Glacial period, but our knowledge concerning\r\nthese local fields is as yet imperfect.\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere the lands are of less extent and, on the\r\nwhole, less studied than in the northern realm. Here and there where\r\nglaciers exist, as in New Zealand and in the southern part of South\r\nAmerica, observant travellers have noticed that these ice fields have\r\nrecently shrunk away. Whether the time of greatest extension and of\r\nretreat coincided with that of the ice sheets in the north is not yet\r\ndetermined; the problem, indeed, is one of some difficulty, and may\r\nlong remain undecided. It seems, however, probable that the glaciers\r\nof the southern hemisphere, like those in the north, are in process of\r\nretreat. If this be true, then their time of greatest extension was\r\nprobably the same as that of the ice sheets about the southern pole.\r\nFrom certain imperfect reports which we have concerning evidences of\r\nglaciation in Central America and in the Andean district in the\r\nnorthern part of South America, it seems possible that at one time the\r\nupland ice along the Cordilleran chain existed from point to point\r\nalong that system of elevations, so that the widest interval between\r\nthe fields of permanent snow with their attendant glaciers did not\r\nmuch exceed a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nObserving the present gradual retreat of those ice remnants which\r\nremain mere shreds and patches of the ancient fields, it seems at\r\nfirst sight likely that the extension and recession of the great\r\nglaciers took place with exceeding slowness. Measured in terms of\r\nhuman life, in the manner in which we gauge matters of man's history,\r\nthis process was doubtless slow. There are reasons, however, to\r\nbelieve that the coming and going were, in a geological sense, swift;\r\nthey may have, indeed, been for a part of the time of startling\r\nrapidity. Going back to the time of geological yesterday, before the\r\nice began its development in the northern hemisphere, all the evidence\r\nwe can find appears to indicate a temperate climate extending far\r\ntoward the north pole. The Miocene deposits found within twelve\r\ndegrees, or a little more than seven hundred miles, of the north pole,\r\nand fairly within the realm of lowest temperature which now exists on\r\nthe earth, show by the plant remains which they contain that the\r\nconditions permitted the growth of forests, the plants having a\r\ntolerably close resemblance to those which now freely develop in the\r\nsouthern portion of the Mississippi Valley. Among them there are\r\nspecies which had the habit of retaining their broad, rather soft\r\nleaves throughout the winter season. The climate appears, in a word,\r\nto have been one where the mean annual temperature must have been\r\nthirty degrees or more higher than the present average of that realm.\r\nAlthough such conditions near the sea level are not inconsistent with\r\nthe supposition that glaciers existed in the higher mountains of the\r\nnorth, they clearly deny the possibility of the realm being occupied\r\nby continental glaciers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pliocene deposits formed in high latitudes have to a\r\ngreat extent been swept away by the subsequent glacial wearing, they\r\nindicate by their fossils a climatal change in the direction of\r\ngreater cold. We trace this change, though obscurely, in a\r\nprogressive manner to a point where the records are interrupted, and\r\nthe next interpretable indication we have is that the ice sheet had\r\nextended to somewhere near the limits which we have noted. We are then\r\ndriven to seek what we can concerning the sojourn of the ice on the\r\nland by the amount of wearing which it has inflicted upon the areas\r\nwhich it occupied. This evidence has a certain, though, as we shall\r\nsee, a limited value.\r\n\r\nWhen the students of glacial action first began the great task of\r\ninterpreting these records, they were led to suppose that the amount\r\nof rock cutting which was done by the ice was very great. Observing\r\nwhat goes on, in the manner we have noted, beneath a valley glacier\r\nsuch as those of Switzerland, they saw that the ice work went on\r\nrapidly, and concluded that if the ice remained long at work in a\r\nregion it must do a vast deal of erosion. They were right in a part of\r\ntheir premises, but, as we shall see, probably in another part wrong.\r\nLooking carefully over the field where the ice has operated, we note\r\nthat, though at first sight the area appears to have lost all trace of\r\nits preglacial river topography, this aspect is due mainly to the\r\nirregular way in which the glacial waste is laid down. Close study\r\nshows us that we may generally trace the old stream valleys down to\r\nthose which were no larger than brooks. It is true that these channels\r\nare generally and in many places almost altogether filled in with\r\nrubbish, but a close study of the question has convinced the writer,\r\nand this against a previous view, that the amount of erosion in New\r\nEngland and Canada, where the work was probably as great as anywhere,\r\nhas not on the average exceeded a hundred feet, and probably was much\r\nless than that amount.\r\n\r\nEven in the region north of Lake Ontario, over which the ice was deep\r\nand remained for a long time, the amount of erosion is singularly\r\nsmall. Thus north of Kingston the little valleys in the limestone\r\nrocks which were cut by the preglacial streams, though somewhat\r\nencumbered with drift, remain almost as distinct as they are on\r\nsimilar strata in central Kentucky, well south of the field which the\r\nice occupied. In fact, the ice sheet appears to have done the greatest\r\npart of its work and to have affected the surface most in the belt of\r\ncountry a few hundred miles in width around the edges of the sheet. It\r\nwas to be expected that in a continental glacier, as in those of\r\nmountain valleys, the most of the _débris_ should be accumulated about\r\nthe margin where the materials dropped from the ice. But why the\r\ncutting action should be greatest in that marginal field is not at\r\nfirst sight clear. To explain this and other features as best we may,\r\nwe shall now consider the probable history of the great ice march in\r\nadvance and retreat, and then take up the conditions which brought\r\nabout its development and its disappearance.\r\n\r\nIce is in many ways the most remarkable substance with which the\r\nphysicist has to deal, and among its eminent peculiarities is that it\r\nexpands in freezing, while the rule is that substances contract in\r\npassing from the fluid to the solid state. On this account frozen\r\nwater acts in a unique manner when subjected to pressure. For each\r\nadditional atmosphere of pressure--a weight amounting to about fifteen\r\npounds to the square inch--the temperature at which the ice will melt\r\nis lowered to the amount of sixteen thousandths of a degree\r\ncentigrade. If we take a piece of ice at the temperature of freezing\r\nand put upon it a sufficient weight, we inevitably bring about a small\r\namount of melting. Where we can examine the mass under favourable\r\nconditions, we can see the fluid gather along the lines of the\r\ncrystals or other bits of which the ice is composed. We readily note\r\nthis action by bringing two pieces of ice together with a slight\r\npressure; when the pressure is removed, they will adhere. The adhesion\r\nis brought about not by any stickiness of the materials, for the\r\nsubstance has no such property. It is accomplished by melting along\r\nthe line of contact, which forms a film of water, that at once\r\nrefreezes when the pressure is withdrawn. When a firm snowball is\r\nmade by even pressing snow, innumerable similar adhesions grow up in\r\nthe manner described. The fact is that, given ice at the temperature\r\nat which it ordinarily forms, pressure upon it will necessarily\r\ndevelop melting.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of pressure melting as above described are in\r\nglaciers extremely complicated. Because the ice is built into the\r\nglacier at a temperature considerably below the freezing point, it\r\nrequires a great thickness of the mass before the superincumbent\r\nweight is sufficient to bring about melting in its lower parts. If we\r\nknew the height at which a thermometer would have stood in the surface\r\nice of the ancient glacier which covered the northern part of North\r\nAmerica, we could with some accuracy compute how thick it must have\r\nbeen before the effect of pressure alone would have brought about\r\nmelting; but even then we should have to reckon the temperature\r\nderived from the grinding of the ice over the floor and the crushing\r\nof rocks there effected, as well as the heat which is constantly\r\nthough slowly coming forth from the earth's interior. The result is\r\nthat we can only say that at some depth, probably less than a mile,\r\nthe slowly accumulating ice would acquire such a temperature that,\r\nsubjected to the weight above it, the material next the bottom would\r\nbecome molten, or at least converted into a sludgelike state, in which\r\nit could not rub against the bottom, or move stones in the manner of\r\nordinary glaciers.\r\n\r\nAs fast as the ice assumed this liquid or softened state, it would be\r\nsqueezed out toward the region where, because of the thinning of the\r\nglacier, it would enter a field where pressure melting did not occur.\r\nIt would then resume the solid state, and thence journey to the margin\r\nof the ice in the ordinary manner. We thus can imagine how such a\r\nglacier as occupied the northern part of this continent could have\r\nmoved from the central parts toward its periphery, as we can not do if\r\nwe assume that the glacier everywhere lay upon the bed rock. There is\r\nno slope from Lake Erie to the Ohio River at Cincinnati. Knowing that\r\nthe ice moved down this line, there are but two methods of accounting\r\nfor its motion: either the slope of the upper surface to the northward\r\nwas so steep that the mass would have been thus urged down, the upper\r\nparts dragging the bottom along with them, or the ice sheet for the\r\ngreater part of its extent rested upon pressure-molten water, or\r\nsludge ice, which was easily squeezed out toward the front. The first\r\nsupposition appears inadmissible, for the reason that the ice would\r\nhave to be many miles deep at Hudson Bay in order that its upper\r\nsurface should have slope enough to overcome the rigidity of the\r\nmaterial and bring about the movement. We know that any such depth is\r\nnot supposable.\r\n\r\nThe recent studies in Greenland supply us with strong corroborative\r\nevidence for the support of the view which is here urged. The wide\r\ncentral field of that area, where the ice has an exceeding slight\r\ndeclivity, and is unruptured by crevices, can not be explained except\r\non the supposition that it rests on pressure-molten water. The thinner\r\nsection next the shore, where the glacier is broken up by those\r\nirregular movements which its wrestle with the bottom inevitably\r\ninduces, shows that there it is in contact with the bed rock, for it\r\nbehaves exactly as do the valley glaciers of like thickness.\r\n\r\nThe view above suggested as to the condition of continental glaciers\r\nenables us to explain not only their movements, but the relatively\r\nslight amount of wearing which they brought about on the lands they\r\noccupied. Beginning to develop in mountain regions, or near the poles\r\non the lowlands, these sheets, as soon as they attained the thickness\r\nwhere the ice at their bottom became molten, would rapidly advance for\r\ngreat distances until they attained districts where the melting\r\nexceeded the supply of frozen material. In this excursion only the\r\nmarginal portion of the glacier would do erosive work. This would\r\nevidently be continued for the greatest amount of time near the front\r\nor outer rim of the ice field, for there, we may presume, that for\r\nthe longest time the cutting rim would rest upon the bed rock of the\r\ncountry. As the ice receded, this rim would fall back; thus in the\r\nretreat as in the advance the whole of the field would be subjected to\r\na certain amount of erosion. On this supposition we should expect to\r\nfind that the front of a continental glacier, fed with pressure-molten\r\nwater from all its interior district, which became converted into ice,\r\nwould attain much warmer regions than the valley streams, where all\r\nthe flow took place in the state of ice, and, furthermore, that the\r\nspeed of the going on the margin would be much more rapid than in the\r\nAlpine streams. These suppositions are well borne out by the study of\r\nexisting continental ice sheets, which move with singular rapidity at\r\ntheir fronts, and by the ancient glaciers, which evidently extended\r\ninto rather warm fields. Thus, when the ice front lay at the site of\r\nCincinnati, at six hundred feet above the sea, there were no glaciers\r\nin the mountains of North Carolina, though those rise more than five\r\nthousand feet higher in the air, and are less than two hundred miles\r\nfarther south. It is therefore evident that the continental glacier at\r\nthis time pushed southward into a comparatively warm country in a way\r\nthat no stream moving in the manner of a valley glacier could possibly\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nThe continental glaciers manage in many cases to convey detritus from\r\na great distance. Thus, when the ice sheet advanced southwardly from\r\nthe regions north of the Great Lakes, they conveyed quantities of the\r\n_débris_ from that section as far south as the Ohio River. In part\r\nthis rubbish was dragged forward by the ice as the sheet advanced; in\r\npart it was urged onward by the streams of liquid water formed by the\r\nordinary process of ice melting. Such subglacial rivers appear to have\r\nbeen formed along the margins of all the great glaciers. We can\r\nsometimes trace their course by the excavation which they have made,\r\nbut more commonly by the long ridges of stratified sand and gravel\r\nwhich were packed into the caverns excavated by these subglacial\r\nrivers, which are known to glacialists as _eskers_, or as serpent\r\nkames. In many cases we can trace where these streams flowed up stream\r\nin the old river valleys until they discharged over their head waters.\r\nThus in the valley of the Genesee, which now flows from Pennsylvania,\r\nwhere it heads against the tributaries of the Ohio and Susquehanna, to\r\nLake Ontario, there was during the Glacial epoch a considerable river\r\nwhich discharged its waters into those of the Ohio and the Susquehanna\r\nover the falls at the head of its course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Front of Muir Glacier, showing ice entering the sea;\r\nalso small icebergs._]\r\n\r\nThe effect of widespread glacial action on a country such as North\r\nAmerica appears to have been, in the first place, to disturb the\r\nattitude of the land by bearing down portions of its surface, a\r\nprocess which led to the uprising of other parts which lay beyond the\r\nrealm of the ice. Within the field of glaciation, so far as the ice\r\nrested bodily on the surface, the rocks were rapidly worn away. A\r\ngreat deal of the _débris_ was ground to fine powder, and went far\r\nwith the waters of the under-running streams. A large part was\r\nentangled in the ice, and moved forward toward the front of the\r\nglacier, where it was either dropped at the margin or, during the\r\nrecession of the glacier, was laid upon the surface as the ice melted\r\naway. The result of this erosion and transportation has been to change\r\nthe conditions of the surface both as regards soil and drainage. As\r\nthe reader has doubtless perceived, ordinary soil is, outside of the\r\nriver valleys, derived from the rock beneath where it lies. In\r\nglaciated districts the material is commonly brought from a\r\nconsiderable distance, often from miles away. These ice-made soils are\r\nrarely very fertile, but they commonly have a great endurance for\r\ntillage, and this for the reason that the earth is refreshed by the\r\ndecay of the pebbles which they contain. Moreover, while the tillable\r\nearth of other regions usually has a limited depth, verging downward\r\ninto the semisoil or subsoil which represent the little changed bed\r\nrocks, glacial deposits can generally be ploughed as deeply as may\r\nprove desirable.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of a country recently affected by glaciers is always\r\nimperfect. Owing to the irregular erosion of the bed rocks, and to the\r\nyet more irregular deposition of the detritus, there are very numerous\r\nlakes which are only slowly filled up or by erosion provided with\r\ndrainage channels. Though several thousand years have passed by since\r\nthe ice disappeared from North America, the greater part of the area\r\nof these fresh-water basins remains, the greater number of them,\r\nmostly those of small size, have become closed.\r\n\r\nWhere an ice stream descends into the sea or into a large lake, the\r\ndepth of which is about as great as the ice is thick, the relative\r\nlightness of the ice tends to make it float, and it shortly breaks off\r\nfrom the parent mass, forming an iceberg. Where, as is generally the\r\ncase in those glaciers which enter the ocean, a current sweeps by the\r\nplace where the berg is formed, it may enter upon a journey which may\r\ncarry the mass thousands of miles from its origin. The bergs separated\r\nfrom the Greenland glaciers, and from those about the south pole, are\r\noften of very great size; sometimes, indeed, they are some thousand\r\nfeet in thickness, and have a length of several miles. It often\r\nhappens that these bergs are formed of ice, which contains in its\r\nlower part a large amount of rock _débris_. As the submerged portion\r\nof the glacier melts in the sea water, these stones are gradually\r\ndropped to the bottom, so that the cargo of one berg may be strewed\r\nalong a line many hundred miles in length. It occasionally happens\r\nthat the ice mass melts more slowly in those parts which are in the\r\nair than in its under-water portions. It thus becomes top-heavy and\r\noverturns, in which case such stony matter as remains attains a\r\nposition where it may be conveyed for a greater distance than if the\r\nglacier were not capsized. It is likely, indeed, that now and then\r\nfragments of rock from Greenland are dropped on the ocean floor in the\r\npart of the Atlantic which is traversed by steamers between our\r\nAtlantic ports and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nExcept for the risks which they bring to navigators, icebergs have no\r\nconsiderable importance. It is true they somewhat affect the\r\ntemperature of sea and air, and they also serve to convey fragments of\r\nstone far out to sea in a way that no other agent can effect; but, on\r\nthe whole, their influence on the conditions of the earth is\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIcebergs in certain cases afford interesting indices as to the motion\r\nof oceanic currents, which, though moving swiftly at a depth below the\r\nsurface, do not manifest themselves on the plain of the sea. Thus in\r\nthe region about Greenland, particularly in Davis Strait, bergs have\r\nbeen seen forcing their way southward at considerable speed through\r\nordinary surface ice, which was either at rest or moving in the\r\nopposite direction. The train of these bergs, which moves upward from\r\nthe south polar continent, west of Patagonia, indicates also in a very\r\nemphatic way the existence of a very strong northward-setting current\r\nin that part of the ocean.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the causes which could bring about such great\r\nextensions of the ice sheet as occurred in the last Glacial period.\r\nHere again we are upon the confines of geological knowledge, and in a\r\nfield where there are no well-cleared ways for the understanding. In\r\nfacing this problem, we should first note that those who are of the\r\nopinion that a Glacial period means a very cold climate in the regions\r\nwhere the ice attained its extension are probably in error. Natural as\r\nit may seem to look for exceeding cold as the cause of glaciation, the\r\nfacts show us that we can not hold this view. In Siberia and in the\r\nparts of North America bordering on the Arctic Sea the average cold is\r\nso intense that the ground is permanently frozen--as it is, for\r\ninstance, in the Klondike district--to the depth of hundreds of feet,\r\nonly the surface thawing out during the warm summers. All this region\r\nis cold enough for glaciers, but there is not sufficient snowfall to\r\nmaintain them. On the other hand, in Greenland, and in a less though\r\nconspicuous degree in Scandinavia, where the waters of the North\r\nAtlantic somewhat diminish the rigour of the cold, and at the same\r\ntime bring about a more abundant snowfall, the two actions being\r\nintimately related, we have very extensive glaciers. Such facts, which\r\ncould be very much extended, make it clear that the climate of glacial\r\nperiods must have been characterized by a great snowfall, and not by\r\nthe most intense cold.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that what would be necessary again to envelop the boreal\r\nparts of North America with a glacial sheet would not be a\r\nconsiderable decrease of heat, but an increase in the winter's\r\ncontribution of frozen water. Even if the heat released by this\r\nsnowfall elevated the average temperature of the winter, as it\r\ndoubtless would in a considerable measure, it would not melt off the\r\nsnow. That snowfall tends to warm the air by setting free the heat\r\nwhich was engaged in keeping the water in a state of vapour is\r\nfamiliarly shown by the warming which attends an ordinary snowstorm.\r\nEven if the fall begin with a temperature of about 0° Fahr., the air\r\nis pretty sure to rise to near the freezing point.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that no great change of temperature is required in order\r\nto bring about a very considerable increase in the amount of snowfall.\r\nIn the ordinary succession of seasons we often note the occurrence of\r\nwinters during which the precipitation of snow is much above the\r\naverage, though it can not be explained by a considerable climatal\r\nchange. We have to account for these departures from the normal\r\nweather by supposing that the atmospheric currents bring in more than\r\nthe usual amount of moisture from the sea during the period when great\r\nfalls of snow occur. In fact, in explaining variations in the humidity\r\nof the land, whether those of a constant nature or those that are to\r\nbe termed accidental, we have always to look to those features which\r\ndetermine the importation of vapour from the great field of the ocean\r\nwhere it enters the air. We should furthermore note that these\r\npeculiarities of climate are dependent upon rather slight geographic\r\naccidents. Thus the snowfall of northern Europe, which serves to\r\nmaintain the glaciation of that region, and, curiously enough, in some\r\nmeasure its general warmth, depends upon the movement of the Gulf\r\nStream from the tropics to high latitudes. If by any geographical\r\nchange, such as would occur if Central America were lowered so as to\r\nmake a free passage for its waters to the westward, the glaciers of\r\nGreenland and of Scandinavia would disappear, and at the same time the\r\ntemperature of those would be greatly lowered. Thus the most evident\r\ncause of glaciation must be sought in those alterations of the land\r\nwhich affect the movement of the oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nApplying this principle to the northern hemisphere, we can in a way\r\nimagine a change which would probably bring about a return of such an\r\nice period as that from which the boreal realm is now escaping. Let us\r\nsuppose that the region of not very high land about Bering Strait\r\nshould sink down so as to afford the Kuro Siwo, or North Pacific\r\nequivalent of our Gulf Stream, an opportunity to enter the Arctic Sea\r\nwith something like the freedom with which the North Atlantic current\r\nis allowed to penetrate to high latitudes. It seems likely that this\r\nPacific current, which in volume and warmth is comparable to that of\r\nthe Atlantic, would so far elevate the temperature of the arctic\r\nwaters that their wide field would be the seat of a great evaporation.\r\nNoting once again the fact that the Greenland glaciers, as well as\r\nthose of Norway, are supplied from seas warmed by the Gulf Stream, we\r\nshould expect the result of this change would be to develop similar\r\nice fields on all the lands near that ocean.\r\n\r\nApplying the data gathered by Dr. Croll for the Gulf Stream, it seems\r\nlikely that the average annual temperature induced in the Arctic Sea\r\nby the free entrance of the Japan current would be between 20° and 30°\r\nFahr. This would convert this wide realm of waters into a field of\r\ngreat evaporation, vastly increasing the annual precipitation. It\r\nseems also certain that the greater part of this precipitation would\r\nbe in the form of snow. It appears to the writer that this cause alone\r\nmay be sufficient to account for the last Glacial period in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. As to the probability that the region about\r\nBering Strait may have been lowered in the manner required by this\r\nview, it may be said that recent studies on the region about Mount St.\r\nElias show that during or just after the ice epoch the shores in that\r\nportion of Alaska were at least four thousand feet lower than at\r\npresent. As this is but a little way from the land which we should\r\nhave to suppose to be lowered in order to admit the Japan current, we\r\ncould fairly conclude that the required change occurred. As for the\r\ncause of the land movement, geologists are still in doubt. They know,\r\nhowever, that the attitudes of the land are exceedingly unstable, and\r\nthat the shores rarely for any considerable time maintain their\r\nposition. It is probable that these swayings of the earth's surface\r\nare due to ever-changing combinations of the weight in different parts\r\nof the crust and the strains arising from the contraction of its inner\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nIn the larger operations of Nature the effects which we behold,\r\nhowever simple, are rarely the products of a single cause. In fact,\r\nthere are few actions so limited that they can fairly be referred to\r\none influence. It is therefore proper to state that there are many\r\nother actions besides those above noted which probably enter into\r\nthose complicated equations which determine the climatal conditions of\r\nthe earth. To have these would carry us into difficult and speculative\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, all the regions which have been subjected to\r\nglaciation are still each year brought temporarily into the glacial\r\nstate. This fact serves to show us that the changes necessary to\r\nproduce great ice sheets are not necessarily of a startling nature,\r\nhowever great the consequences may be. Assuming, then, that relatively\r\nslight alterations of climate may cause the ice sheet to come and go,\r\nwe may say that all the influences which have been suggested by the\r\nstudents of glaciation, and various other slighter causes which can\r\nnot be here noted, may have co-operated to produce the peculiar\r\nresult. In this equation geographic change has affected the course of\r\nthe ocean currents, and has probably been the most influential, or at\r\nleast the commonest, cause to which we must attribute the extension of\r\nice sheets. Next, alterations of the solar heat may be looked to as a\r\nchange-bringing action; unfortunately, however, we have no direct\r\nevidence that this is an efficient cause. Thirdly, the variations in\r\nthe eccentricity of the earth's orbit, combined with the precession of\r\nthe equinoxes and the rotation of the apsides, may be regarded as\r\noperative. The last of all, changes in the constitution of the\r\natmosphere, have to be taken into account. To these must be added, as\r\nbefore remarked, many less important actions which influence this\r\nmarvellously delicate machine, the work of which is expressed in the\r\nphenomena assembled under the name of climate.\r\n\r\nEvidence is slowly accumulating which serves to show that glacial\r\nperiods of greater or less importance have been of frequent occurrence\r\nat all stages in the history of the earth of which we have a distinct\r\nrecord. As these accidents write their history upon the ground alone,\r\nand in a way impermanently, it is difficult to trace the ice times of\r\nancient geological periods. The scratches on the bed rocks, and the\r\naccumulations of detritus formed as the ice disappeared, have alike\r\nbeen worn away by the agents of decay. Nevertheless, we can trace here\r\nand there in the older strata accumulations of pebbly matter often\r\ncontaining large boulders, which clearly were shaped and brought\r\ntogether by glacial action. These are found in some instances far\r\nsouth of the region occupied by the glaciers during the last ice\r\nepoch. They occur in rocks of the Cambrian or Silurian age in eastern\r\nTennessee and western North Carolina; they are also found in India\r\nbeyond the limits to which glaciers have attained in modern times.\r\n\r\nIn closing this inadequate account of glacial action, a story which\r\nfor its complete telling would require many volumes, it is well for\r\nthe reader to consider once again how slight are the changes of\r\nclimate which may alternately withdraw large parts of the land from\r\nthe uses of life, and again quickly restore the fields to the service\r\nof plants and animals. He may well imagine that these changes, by\r\ndriving living creatures to and fro, profoundly affect the history of\r\ntheir development. This matter will be dealt with in the volume\r\nconcerning the history of organic beings.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice went off from the northern part of this continent, the\r\nsurface of the country, which had been borne down by the weight of the\r\nglacier, still remained depressed to a considerable depth below the\r\nlevel of the sea, the depression varying from somewhere about one\r\nhundred feet in southern New England to a thousand feet or more in\r\nhigh latitudes. Over this region, which lay beneath the level of the\r\nsea, the glacier, when it became thin enough to float, was doubtless\r\nbroken up into icebergs, in the manner which we now behold along the\r\ncoast of Greenland. Where the shore was swept by a strong current,\r\nthese bergs doubtless drifted away; but along the most of the coast\r\nline they appear to have lain thickly grouped next the shores,\r\ngradually delivering their loads of stones and finer _débris_ to the\r\nbottom. These masses of floating ice in many cases seem to have\r\nprevented the sea waves from attaining the shore, and thus hindered\r\nthe formation of those beaches which in their present elevated\r\ncondition enable us to interpret the old position of the sea along\r\ncoast lines which have been recently elevated. Here and there,\r\nhowever, from New Jersey to Greenland, we find bits of these ancient\r\nshores which clearly tell the story of that down-sinking of the land\r\nbeneath the burden of the ice which is such an instructive feature in\r\nthe history of that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                  THE WORK OF UNDERGROUND WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already noted two means by which water finds its way\r\nunderground. The simplest and largest method by which this action is\r\neffected is by building in the fluid as the grains of the rock are\r\nlaid down on the floors of seas or lakes. The water thus imprisoned is\r\nfirmly inclosed in the interstices of the stone, it in time takes up\r\ninto its mass a certain amount of the mineral materials which are\r\ncontained in the deep-buried rocks. The other portion of the ground\r\nwater--that with which we are now to be specially concerned--arises\r\nfrom the rain which descends into the crevices of the earth; it is\r\ntherefore peculiar to the lands. For convenience we shall term the\r\noriginal embedded fluid _rock water_, and that which originates from\r\nthe rain _crevice water_, the two forming the mass of the earth water.\r\n\r\nThe crevice water of the earth, although forming at no time more than\r\na very small fraction of the hidden fluid, is an exceedingly potent\r\ngeological agent, doing work which, though unseen, yet affords the\r\nvery foundations on which rest the life alike of land and sea. When\r\nthis water enters the earth, though it is purified of all mineral\r\nmaterials, it has already begun to acquire a share of a gaseous\r\nsubstance, carbonic acid, or, as chemists now term it, carbon dioxide,\r\nwhich enables the fluid to begin its rôle of marvellous activities. In\r\nits descent as rain, probably even before it was gathered in drops in\r\nthe cloud realm, the water absorbs a certain portion of this gas from\r\nthe atmosphere. Entering the realm of the soil, where the decaying\r\norganic matter plentifully gives forth carbon dioxide, a further store\r\nof the gas is acquired. At the ordinary pressure of the air, water may\r\ntake in many times its bulk of the gas.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of carbonic acid when it is absorbed by water is\r\ngreatly to increase the capacity which that fluid has for taking\r\nmineral matters into solution. When charged with this gas, in the\r\nmeasure in which it may be in the soil, water is able to dissolve\r\nabout fifty times as much limestone as it can in its perfectly pure\r\nform take up. A familiar instance of this peculiar capacity which the\r\ngas gives may often be seen where the water from a soda-water fountain\r\ndrips upon the marble slab beneath. In a few years this slab will be\r\nconsiderably corroded, though pure water would in the same time have\r\nhad no effect upon it.\r\n\r\nThe first and by far the most important effect of crevice water is\r\nexercised upon the soil, which is at once the product of this action,\r\nand the laboratory where the larger part of the work is done.\r\nPenetrating between the grains of the detrital covering, held in large\r\nquantities in the coating, and continually in slow motion, the\r\ngas-charged water takes a host of substances into solution, and brings\r\nthem into a condition where they may react upon each other in the\r\nchemical manner. These materials are constantly being offered to the\r\nroots of plants and brought in contact with the underlying rock which\r\nhas not passed into the state of soil. The changes induced in this\r\nstony matter lead to its breaking up, or at least to its softening to\r\nthe point where the roots can penetrate it and complete its\r\ndestruction. Thus it comes about that the water which to a great\r\nextent divides the rocks into the state of soil, which is continually\r\nwearing away the material on the surface, or leaching it out through\r\nthe springs, is also at work in restoring the layer from beneath.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the water which enters the soil does not\r\npenetrate to any great depth in the underlying rocks, but finds its\r\nway to the surface after no long journey in the form of small springs.\r\nGenerally those superficial springs do not emerge through distinct\r\nchannels, but move, though slowly, in a massive way down the slopes\r\nuntil they enter a water course. Along the banks of any river, however\r\nsmall, or along the shores of the sea, a pit a few inches deep just\r\nabove the level of the water will be quickly filled by a flow from\r\nthis sheet which underlies the earth. At a distance from the stream\r\nthis sheet spring is in contact with the bed rocks, and may be many\r\nfeet below the surface, but it comes to the level of the river or the\r\nsea near their margins. Here and there the shape of the bed rocks,\r\nbeing like converging house roofs, causes the superficial springs to\r\nform small pipelike channels for the escape of their gathered waters,\r\nand the flow emerges at a definite point. Almost all these sources of\r\nconsiderable flow are due to the action of the water on the underlying\r\nrock, where we shall now follow that portion of the crevice water\r\nwhich penetrates deeply into the earth.\r\n\r\nAlmost all rocks, however firm they may appear to be, are divided by\r\ncrevices which extend from the soil level it may be to the depths of\r\nthousands of feet. These rents are in part due to the strains of\r\nmountain-building, which tend to disrupt the firmest stone, leaving\r\nopen fractures. They are also formed in other ways, as by the\r\nimperfectly understood agencies which produce joint planes. It often\r\nhappens that where rocks are highly tilted water finds its way\r\ndownward between the layers, which are imperfectly soldered together,\r\nor a bed of coarse material, such as sandstone or conglomerate, may\r\nafford an easy way by which the water may descend for miles beneath\r\nthe surface. Passing through rocks which are not readily soluble, the\r\nwater, already to a great extent supplied with mineral matter by its\r\njourney through the soil, may not do much excavating work, and even\r\nafter a long time may only slightly enlarge the spaces in which it\r\nmay be stored or the channels by which it discharges to the surface.\r\nHence it comes about that in many countries, even where the waters\r\npenetrate deeply, they do not afford large springs. It is otherwise\r\nwhere the crevice waters enter limestones composed of materials which\r\nare readily dissolved. In such places we find the rain so readily\r\nentering the underlying rock that no part of the fall goes at once to\r\nthe brooks, but all has a long underground journey.\r\n\r\nIn any limestone district where the beds of the material are thick and\r\ntolerably pure--as, for instance, in the cavern district of southern\r\nKentucky--the traveller who enters the region notes at once that the\r\nusual small streams which in every region of considerable rainfall he\r\nis accustomed to see intersecting the surface of the country are\r\nentirely absent. In their place he notes everywhere pitlike\r\ndepressions of bowl-shaped form, the sink holes to which we have\r\nalready adverted. Through the openings in the bottom of these the rain\r\nwaters descend into the depths of the earth. Although the most of\r\nthese depressions have but small openings in their bottom, now and\r\nthen one occurs with a vertical shaft sufficiently large to permit the\r\nexplorer to descend into it, though he needs to be lowered down in the\r\nmanner of a miner who is entering a shaft. In fact, the journey is\r\nnearly always one of some hazard; it should not be undertaken save\r\nwith many precautions to insure safety.\r\n\r\nWhen one is lowered away through an open sink hole, though the descent\r\nmay at first be somewhat tortuous, the explorer soon finds himself\r\nswinging freely in the air, it may be at a point some hundred feet\r\nabove the base of the bottle-shaped shaft or dome into which he has\r\nentered. Commonly the neck of the bottle is formed where the water has\r\nworked its way through a rather sandy limestone, a rock which was not\r\nreadily dissolved by the water. In the pure and therefore easily cut\r\nlimestone layers the cavity rapidly expands until the light of the\r\nlantern may not disclose its walls. Farther down there is apt to be a\r\nshelf composed of another impure limestone, which extends off near the\r\nmiddle of the shaft. If the explorer can land upon this shelf, he is\r\nsure to find that from this imperfect floor the cavern extends off in\r\none or more horizontal galleries, which he may follow for a great\r\ndistance until he comes to the point where there is again a well-like\r\nopening through the hard layer, with another dome-shaped base beneath.\r\nReturning to the main shaft, the explorer may continue his descent\r\nuntil he attains the base of this vertical section of the cave, where\r\nhe is likely to find himself delivered in a pool of water of no great\r\ndepth, the bottom of which is occupied by a quantity of small, hard\r\nstones of a flinty nature, which have evidently come from the upper\r\nparts of the cavern. The close observer will have noted that here and\r\nthere in the limestone there are flinty bits, such as those which he\r\nfinds in the pool. From the bottom of the dome a determined inquirer\r\ncan often make his way along the galleries which lead from that level,\r\nthough it may be after a journey of miles to the point where he\r\nemerges from the cavern on the banks of an open-air river.\r\n\r\nAlthough a journey by way of the sink holes through a cavern system is\r\nto be commended for the reason that it is the course of the caverning\r\nwaters, it is, on the whole, best to approach the cave through their\r\nexits along the banks of a stream or through the chance openings which\r\nare here and there made by the falling in of their roofs. One\r\nadvantage of this cavity of entrance is that we can thus approach the\r\ncavern in times of heavy rain when the processes which lead to their\r\nconstruction are in full activity. Coming in this way to one of the\r\ndomes formed beneath a sink hole, we may observe in rainy weather that\r\nthe water falling down the deep shaft strikes the bottom with great\r\nforce; in many of the Kentucky caves it falls from a greater height\r\nthan Niagara. At such times the stones in the basin at the bottom of\r\nthe shaft are vigorously whirled about, and in their motion they cut\r\nthe rocks in the bottom of the basin--in fact, this cavity is a great\r\npot hole, like those at the base of open-air cascades. It is now easy\r\nto interpret the general principles which determine the architecture\r\nof the cavern realm.\r\n\r\nWhen it first enters the earth all the work which the water does in\r\nthe initial steps of cavern formation is effected by solution. As the\r\ncrevice enlarges and deepens, the stream acquires velocity, and begins\r\nto use the bits of hard rock in boring. It works downward in this way\r\nby the mixed mechanical and chemical action until it encounters a hard\r\nlayer. Then the water creeps horizontally through the soft stratum,\r\ndoing most of its work by solution, until it finds a crevice in the\r\nfloor through which it can excavate farther in the downward direction;\r\nso it goes on in the manner of steps until it burrows channels to the\r\nopen stream. In time the vertical fall under the sink hole will cut\r\nthrough the hard layer, when the water, abandoning the first line of\r\nexit, will develop another at a lower level, and so in time it comes\r\nabout that there may be several stories of the cave, the lowest being\r\nthe last to be excavated. Of the total work thus done, only a small\r\npart is accomplished by the falling of the water, acting through the\r\nboring action of its tools, the bits of stone before mentioned; the\r\nprincipal part of the task is done by the solvent action of the\r\ncarbonated waters on the limestone. In the system of caverns known as\r\nthe Mammoth Cave, in Kentucky, the writer has estimated that at least\r\nnine tenths of the stone was removed in the state of solution.\r\n\r\nWhen first excavated, the chambers of a limestone cavern have little\r\nbeauty to attract the eye. The curves of the walls are sometimes\r\ngraceful, but the aspect of the chambers, though in a measure grand,\r\nis never charming. When, however, the waters have ceased to carve the\r\nopenings, when they have been drained away by the formation of\r\nchannels on a lower level, there commonly sets in a process known as\r\nstalactitization, which transforms the scene into one of singular\r\nbeauty. We have already noted the fact that everywhere in ordinary\r\nrocks there are crevices through which water, moving under the\r\npressure of the fluid which is above, may find its way slowly\r\ndownward. In the limestone roofs of caverns, particularly in those of\r\nthe upper story, this ooze of water passes through myriads of unseen\r\nfissures at a rate so slow that it often evaporates in the dry air\r\nwithout dropping to the floor. When it comes out of the rocks the\r\nwater is charged with various salts of lime; when it evaporates it\r\nleaves the material behind on the roof. Where the outflow is so slight\r\nthat the fluid does not gather into drops, it forms an incrustation of\r\nlimy matter, which often gathers in beautiful flowerlike forms, or\r\nperhaps in the shape of a sheet of alabaster. Where drops are formed,\r\na small, pendent cone grows downward from the ceiling, over which the\r\nwater flows, and on which it evaporates. This cone grows slowly\r\ndownward until it may attain the floor of the chamber, which has a\r\nheight of thirty feet or more. If all the water does not evaporate,\r\nthat which trickles off the apex of the cone, striking on the floor,\r\nis splashed out into a thin sheet, so that it evaporates in a speedy\r\nmanner, lays down its limestone, and thus builds another and ruder\r\ncone, which grows upward toward that which is pendent above it.\r\nFinally, they grow together, enlarged by the process which constructed\r\nthem, until a mighty column may be formed, sculptured as if by the\r\nhands of a fantastic architect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Stalactites and stalagmites on roof and floor\r\nof a cavern. The arrows show the direction of the moving water.]\r\n\r\nAll the while that subterranean streams are cutting the caverns\r\ndownward the open-air rivers into which they discharge are deepening\r\ntheir beds, and thereby preparing for the construction of yet lower\r\nstories of caves. These open-air streams commonly flow in steep-sided,\r\nnarrow valleys, which themselves were caves until the galleries became\r\nso wide that they could no longer support the roof. Thus we often find\r\nthat for a certain distance the roof over a large stream has fallen\r\nin, so that the water flows in the open air. Then it will plunge\r\nunder an arch and course, it may be, for some miles, before it again\r\narrives at a place where the roof has disappeared, or perhaps attains\r\na field occupied by rocks of another character, in which caverns were\r\nnot formed. At places these old river caverns are abandoned by the\r\nstreams, which find other courses. They form natural tunnels, which\r\nare not infrequently of considerable length. One such in southwestern\r\nVirginia has been made useful for a railway passing from one valley to\r\nanother, thus sparing the expense of a costly excavation. Where the\r\nremnant of the arch is small, it is commonly known as a natural\r\nbridge, of which that in Rockbridge County, in Virginia, is a very\r\nnoble example. Arches of this sort are not uncommon in many cavern\r\ncountries; five such exist in Carter County, Kentucky, a district in\r\nthe eastern part of that State which abounds in caverns, though none\r\nof them are of conspicuous height or beauty.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It is reported that one of these natural bridges of Carter\r\nCounty has recently fallen down. This is the natural end of these\r\nfeatures. As before remarked, they are but the remnants of much more\r\nextensive roofs which the processes of decay have brought to ruin.]\r\n\r\nAt this stage of his studies on cavern work the student will readily\r\nconceive that, as the surface of the country overlying the cave is\r\nincessantly wearing down, the upper stories of the system are\r\ncontinually disappearing, while new ones are forming at the present\r\ndrainage level of the country. In fact, the attentive eye can in such\r\na district find here and there evidences of this progressive\r\ndestruction. Not only do the caves wear out from above, but their\r\nroofs are constantly falling to their floors, a process which is\r\ngreatly aided by the growth of stalactites. Forming in the crevices or\r\njoints between the stones, these rock growths sometimes prize off\r\ngreat blocks. In other cases the weight of the pendent stalactite\r\ndrags the ill-supported masses of the roof to the floor. In this way a\r\ngallery originally a hundred feet below the surface may work its way\r\nupward to the light of day. The entrance by which the Mammoth Cave is\r\napproached appears to have been formed in this manner, and at several\r\npoints in that system of caverns the effect of this action may be\r\ndistinctly observed.\r\n\r\nWe must now go a step further on the way of subterranean water, and\r\ntrace its action in the depths below the plane of ordinary caves,\r\nwhich, as we have noted, do not extend below the level of the main\r\nstreams of the cavern district. The first group of facts to be\r\nattended to is that exhibited by artesian wells. These occur where\r\nrocks have been folded down into a basinlike form. It often happens\r\nthat in such a basin the rocks of which it is composed are some of\r\nthem porous, and others impervious to water, and that the porous\r\nlayers outcrop on the high margins of the depression and have\r\nwater-tight layers over them. These conditions can be well represented\r\nby supposing that we have two saucers, one within the other, with an\r\nintervening layer of sand which is full of water. If now we bore an\r\nopening in the bottom of the uppermost saucer, we readily conceive\r\nthat the water will flow up through it. In Nature we often find these\r\nbasins with the equivalent of the sandy layer in the model just\r\ndescribed rising hundreds of feet above the valley, so that the\r\nartesian well, so named from the village of Artois, near Paris, where\r\nthe first opening of this nature was made, may yield a stream which\r\nwill mount upward, especially where piped, to a great height. At many\r\nplaces in the world it is possible by such wells to obtain a large\r\nsupply of tolerably pure water, but in general it is found to contain\r\ntoo large a supply of dissolved mineral matter or sulphuretted gases\r\nto be satisfactory for domestic purposes. It may be well to note the\r\nfact that the greater part of the so-called artesian wells, or borings\r\nwhich deliver water to a height above the surface, are not true\r\nartesian sources, in that they do not send up the water by the action\r\nof gravitation, but under the influence of gaseous pressure.\r\n\r\nWhere, as in the case of upturned porous beds, the crevice water\r\npenetrates far below the earth's surface or the open-air streams which\r\ndrain the water away, the fluid acquires a considerable increase of\r\ntemperature, on the average about one degree Fahrenheit for each\r\neighty feet of descent. It may, indeed, become so heated that if it\r\nwere at the earth's surface it would not only burst into steam with a\r\nvast explosive energy, but would actually shine in the manner of\r\nheated solids. As the temperature of water rises, and as the pressure\r\non it increases, it acquires a solvent power, and takes in rocky\r\nmatter in a measure unapproached at the earth's surface. At the depth\r\nof ten miles water beginning as inert rain would acquire the\r\nproperties which we are accustomed to associate with strong acids.\r\nPassing downward through fissures or porous strata in the manner\r\nindicated in the diagram, the water would take up, by virtue of its\r\nheat and the gases it contained, a share of many mineral substances\r\nwhich we commonly regard as insoluble. Gold and even platinum--the\r\nlatter a material which resists all acids at ordinary\r\ntemperatures--enters into the solution. If now the water thus charged\r\nwith mineral stores finds in the depths a shorter way to the surface\r\nthan that which it descended, which may well happen by way of a deep\r\nrift in the rocks, it will in its ascent reverse the process which it\r\nfollowed on going down. It will deposit the several minerals in the\r\norder of their solubilities--that is, the last to be taken in will be\r\nthe first to be crystallized on the walls of the fissure through which\r\nthe upflow is taking place. The result will be the formation of a vein\r\nbelonging to the variety known as fissure veins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Diagram of vein. The different shadings show\r\nthe variations in the nature of the deposits.]\r\n\r\nA vein deposit such as we are considering may, though rarely, be\r\ncomposed of a single mineral. Most commonly we find the deposit\r\narranged in a banded form in the manner indicated in the figure (see\r\ndiagram 14). Sometimes one material will abound in the lower portions\r\nof the fissure and another in its higher parts, a feature which is\r\naccounted for by the progressive cooling and relinquishment of\r\npressure to which the water is subjected on its way to the surface.\r\nWith each decrement of those properties some particular substance goes\r\nout of the fluid, which may in the end emerge in the form of a warm or\r\nhot spring, the water of which contains but little mineral matter.\r\nWhere, however, the temperature is high, some part of the deposit,\r\neven a little gold, may be laid down just about the spring in the\r\ndeposits known as sinter, which are often formed at such places.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the ore deposits are formed not only in the main channel\r\nof the fissure, but in all the crevices on either side of that way. In\r\nthis manner, much as in the case of the growth of stalactitic matter\r\nbetween the blocks of stone in the roofs of a cavern, large fragments\r\nof rock, known as \"horses,\" are often pushed out into the body of the\r\nvein. In some instances the growth of the vein appears to enlarge the\r\nfissure or place of the deposit as the accumulation goes on, the\r\nprocess being analogous to that by which a growing root widens the\r\ncrevice into which it has penetrated. In other instances the fissure\r\nformed by the force has remained wide open, or at most has been but\r\npartly filled by the action of the water.\r\n\r\nIt not infrequently happens that the ascending waters of hot springs\r\nentering limestones have excavated extensive caves far below the\r\nsurface of the earth, these caverns being afterward in part filled by\r\nthe ores of various metals. We can readily imagine that the water at\r\none temperature would excavate the cavern, and long afterward, when at\r\na lower heat, they might proceed to fill it in. At a yet later stage,\r\nwhen the surface of the country had worn down many thousands of feet\r\nbelow the original level, the mineral stores of the caverns may be\r\nbrought near the surface of the earth. Some of the most important\r\nmetalliferous deposits of the Cordilleras are found in this group of\r\nhot-water caverns. These caverns are essentially like those produced\r\nby cold water, with the exception of the temperature of the fluid\r\nwhich does the work and the opposite direction of the flow.\r\n\r\nIn following crevice water which is free to obey the impulses of\r\ngravitation far down into the earth, we enter on a realm where the\r\nrock or construction water, that which was built into the stone at\r\nthe time of its formation, is plentiful. Where these two groups of\r\nwaters come in contact an admixture occurs, a certain portion of the\r\nrock water joining that in the crevices. Near the surface of the\r\nground we commonly find that all the construction water has been\r\nwashed out by this action. Yet if the rocks be compact, or if they\r\nhave layers of a soft and clayey nature, we may find the construction\r\nwater, even in very old deposits, remaining near the surface of the\r\nground. Thus in the ancient Silurian beds of the Ohio Valley a boring\r\ncarried a hundred feet below the level of the main rivers commonly\r\ndiscovers water which is clearly that laid down in the crevices of the\r\nmaterial at the time when the rocks were formed in the sea. In all\r\ncases this water contains a certain amount of gases derived from the\r\ndecomposition of various substances, but principally from the\r\nalteration of iron pyrite, which affords sulphuretted hydrogen. Thus\r\nthe water is forced to the surface with considerable energy, and the\r\nwell is often named artesian, though it flows by gas pressure on the\r\nprinciple of the soda-water fountain, and not by gravity, as in the\r\ncase of true artesian wells.\r\n\r\nThe passage between the work done by the deeply penetrating surface\r\nwater and that due to the fluid intimately blended with the rock built\r\ninto the mass at the time of its formation is obscure. We are,\r\nhowever, quite sure that at great depths beneath the earth the\r\nconstruction water acts alone not only in making veins, but in\r\nbringing about many other momentous changes. At a great depth this\r\nwater becomes intensely heated, and therefore tends to move in any\r\ndirection where a chance fissure or other accident may lessen the\r\npressure. Creeping through the rocks, and moving from zones of one\r\ntemperature to another, these waters bring about in the fine\r\ninterstices chemical changes which lead to great alterations in the\r\nconstitution of the rock material. It is probably in part to these\r\nslow driftings of rock water that beds originally made up of small,\r\nshapeless fragments, such as compose clay slates, sandstones, and\r\nlimestones, may in time be altered into crystalline rocks, where there\r\nis no longer a trace of the original bits, all the matter having been\r\ntaken to pieces by the process of dissolving, and reformed in the\r\nregular crystalline order. In many cases we may note how a crystal\r\nafter being made has been in part dissolved away and replaced by\r\nanother mineral. In fact, many of our rocks appear to have been again\r\nand again made over by the slow-drifting waters, each particular state\r\nin their construction being due to some peculiarity of temperature or\r\nof mineral contents which the fluid held. These metamorphic phenomena,\r\nthough important, are obscure, and their elucidation demands some\r\nknowledge of petrographic science, that branch of geology which\r\nconsiders the principles of rock formation. They will therefore not be\r\nfurther considered in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VOLCANOES.\r\n\r\nOf old it was believed that volcanoes represented the outpouring of\r\nfluid rock which came forth from the central realm of the earth, a\r\nregion which was supposed still to retain the liquid state through\r\nwhich the whole mass of our earth has doubtless passed. Recent\r\nstudies, however, have brought about a change in the views of\r\ngeologists which is represented by the fact that we shall treat\r\nvolcanic phenomena in connection with the history of rock water.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to understand the phenomena of volcanoes it is very\r\ndesirable that the student should understand what goes on in a normal\r\neruption. The writer may, therefore, be warranted in describing some\r\nobservations which he had an opportunity to make at an eruption of\r\nVesuvius in 1883, when it was possible to behold far more than can\r\nordinarily be discerned in such outbreaks--in fact, the opportunity of\r\na like nature has probably not been enjoyed by any other person\r\ninterested in volcanic action. In the winter of 1882-'83 Vesuvius was\r\nsubjected to a succession of slight outbreaks. At the time of the\r\nobservations about to be noted the crater had been reduced to a cup\r\nabout three hundred feet in diameter and about a hundred feet deep.\r\nThe vertical shaft at the bottom, through which the outbursts were\r\ntaking place, was about a hundred feet across. Taking advantage of a\r\nheavy gale from the northwest, it was practicable, notwithstanding the\r\nexplosions, to climb to the edge of the crater wall. Looking down into\r\nthe throat of the volcano, although the pit was full of whirling\r\nvapours and the heat was so great that the protection of a mask was\r\nnecessary, it was possible to see something of what was going on at\r\nthe moment of an explosion.\r\n\r\nThe pipe of the volcano was full of white-hot lava. Even in a day of\r\nsunshine, which was only partly obscured by the vapours which hung\r\nabout the opening, the heat of the lava made it very brilliant. This\r\nmass of fluid rock was in continuous motion, swaying violently up and\r\ndown the tube. From four to six times a minute, at the moment of its\r\nupswaying, it would burst as by the explosion of a gigantic bubble.\r\nThe upper portion of the mass was blown upward in fragments, the\r\ndischarge being like that of shot from a fowling piece; the fragments,\r\nvarying in size from small, shotlike bits to masses larger than a\r\nman's head, were shot up sometimes to the height of fifteen hundred\r\nfeet above the point of ejection. The wind, blowing at the rate of\r\nabout forty miles an hour, drove the falling bits of rock to the\r\nleeward, so that there was no considerable danger to be apprehended\r\nfrom them. Some seconds after the explosion they could be heard\r\nrattling down on the farther slope of the cone. Observations on the\r\ninterval between the discharge and the fall of the fragments made it\r\neasy to compute the height to which they were thrown.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when the lava in the pipe opened for the passage of the\r\nvapour which created the explosion the movement, though performed in\r\na fraction of a second, was clearly visible. At first the vapour was\r\ncolourless; a few score feet up it began to assume a faint, bluish\r\nhue; yet higher, when it was more expanded, the tint changed to that\r\nof steam, which soon became of the ordinary aspect, and gathered in\r\nswift-revolving clouds. The watery nature of the vapour was perfectly\r\nevident by its odour. Though commingled with sulphurous-acid gas, it\r\nstill had the characteristic smell of steam. For a half hour it was\r\npossible to watch the successive explosions, and even to make rough\r\nsketches of the scene. Occasionally the explosions would come in quick\r\nsuccession, so that the lava was blown out of the tube; again, the\r\npool would merely sway up and down in a manner which could be\r\nexplained only by supposing that great bubbles of vapour were working\r\ntheir way upward toward the point where they could burst. Each of\r\nthese bubbles probably filled a large part of the diameter of the\r\npipe. In general, the phenomena recalled the escape of the jet from a\r\ngeyser, or, to take a familiar instance, that of steam from the pipe\r\nof a high-pressure engine. When the heat is great, steam may often be\r\nseen at the mouth of the pipe with the same transparent appearance\r\nwhich was observed in the throat of the crater. In the cold air of the\r\nmountain the vapour was rapidly condensed, giving a rainbow hue in the\r\nclouds when they were viewed at the right angle. The observations were\r\ninterrupted by the fact that the wind so far died away that large\r\nballs of the ejected lava began to fall on the windward side of the\r\ncone. These fragments, though cooled and blackened on their outside by\r\ntheir considerable journey up and down through the air, were still so\r\nsoft that they splashed when they struck the surface of cinders.\r\n\r\nWatching the cone from a distance, one could note that from time to\r\ntime the explosions, increasing in frequency, finally attained a point\r\nwhere the action appeared to be continuous. The transition was\r\ncomparable to that which we may observe in a locomotive which, when it\r\nfirst gets under way, gives forth occasional jets of steam, but,\r\nslowly gaining speed, finally pours forth what to eye and ear alike\r\nseem to be a continuous outrush. All the evidence that we have\r\nconcerning volcanic outbreaks corroborates that just cited, and is to\r\nthe effect that the essence of the action consists in the outbreak of\r\nwater vapour at a high temperature, and therefore endowed with very\r\ngreat expansive force. Along with this steam there are many other\r\ngases, which always appear to be but a very small part of the whole\r\nescape of a vaporous nature--in fact, the volcanic steam, so far as\r\nits chemical composition has been ascertained, has the composition\r\nwhich we should expect to find in rock water which had been forced out\r\nfrom the rock by the tensions that high temperature creates.\r\n\r\nBecause of its conspicuous nature, the lava which flows from most\r\nvolcanoes, or is blown out from them in the form of finely divided\r\nash, is commonly regarded as the primary feature in a volcanic\r\noutbreak. Such is not really the case. Volcanic explosions may occur\r\nwith very little output of fluid rock, and that which comes forth may\r\nconsist altogether of the finely divided bits of rock to which we give\r\nthe name of ash. In fact, in all very powerful explosions we may\r\nexpect to find no lava flow, but great quantities of this finely\r\ndivided rock, which when it started from the depths of the earth was\r\nin a fluid state, but was blown to pieces by the contained vapour as\r\nit approached the surface.\r\n\r\nIf the student is so fortunate as to behold a flood of lava coming\r\nforth from the flanks of a volcano, he will observe that even at the\r\nvery points of issue, where the material is white-hot and appears to\r\nbe as fluid as water, the whole surface gives forth steam. On a still\r\nday, viewed from a distance, the path of a lava flow is marked by a\r\ndense cloud of this vapour which comes forth from it. Even after the\r\nlava has cooled so that it is safe to walk upon it, every crevice\r\ncontinues to pour forth steam. Years after the flowing has ceased, and\r\nwhen the rock surface has become cool enough for the growth of\r\ncertain plants upon it, these crevices still yield steam. It is\r\nevident, in a word, that a considerable part of a lava mass, even\r\nafter it escapes from the volcanic pipes, is water which is intimately\r\ncommingled with the rock, probably lying between the very finest\r\ngrains of the heated substance. Yet this lava which has come forth\r\nfrom the volcano has only a portion of the water which it originally\r\ncontained; a large, perhaps the greater part, has gone forth in the\r\nexplosive way through the crater. It is reasonably believed that the\r\nfluidity of lava is in considerable measure due to the water which it\r\ncontains, and which serves to give the mass the consistence of paste,\r\nthe partial fluidity of flour and rock grains being alike brought\r\nabout in the same manner.\r\n\r\nSo much of the phenomena of volcanoes as has been above noted is\r\nintended to show the large part which interstitial water plays in\r\nvolcanic action. We shall now turn our attention again to the state of\r\nthe deeply buried rock water, to see how far we may be able by it to\r\naccount for these strange explosive actions. When sediments are laid\r\ndown on the sea floor the materials consist of small, irregularly\r\nshaped fragments, which lie tumbled together in the manner of a mass\r\nof bricks which have been shot out of a cart. Water is buried in the\r\nplentiful interspaces between these bits of stone; as before remarked,\r\nthe amount of this construction water varies. In general, it is at\r\nfirst not far from one tenth part of the materials. Besides the fluid\r\ncontained in the distinct spaces, there is a share which is held as\r\ncombined water in the intimate structure of the crystals, if such\r\nthere be in the mass. When this water is built into the stone it has\r\nthe ordinary temperature of the sea bottom. As the depositing actions\r\ncontinue to work, other beds are formed on the top of that which we\r\nare considering, and in time the layer may be buried to the depth of\r\nmany thousand feet. There are reasons to believe that on the floors of\r\nthe oceans this burial of beds containing water may have brought great\r\nquantities of fluid to the depth of twenty miles or more below the\r\nouter surface of the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Flow of lava invading a forest. A tree in the\r\ndistance is not completely burned, showing that the molten rock had\r\nlost much of its original heat.]\r\n\r\nThe effect of deep burial is to increase the heat of strata. This\r\nresult is accomplished in two different ways. The direct effect\r\narising from the imposition of weight, that derived from the mass of\r\nstratified material, is, as we know, to bring about a down-sinking of\r\nthe earth's crust. In the measure of this falling, heat is engendered\r\nprecisely as it is by the falling of a trip-hammer on the anvil, with\r\nwhich action, as is well known, we may heat an iron bar to a high\r\ntemperature. It is true that this down-sinking of the surface under\r\nweight is in part due to the compression of the rocks, and in part to\r\nthe slipping away of the soft underpinning of more or less fluid rock.\r\nYet further it is in some measure brought about by the wrinkling of\r\nthe crust. But all these actions result in the conversion of energy of\r\nposition into heat, and so far serve to raise the temperature of the\r\nrocks which are concerned in the movements. By far the largest source\r\nof heat, however, is that which comes forth from the earth's interior,\r\nand which was stored there in the olden day when the matter forming\r\nthe earth gathered into the mass of our sphere. This, which we may\r\nterm the original heat, is constantly flowing forth into space, but\r\nmakes its way slowly, because of the non-conductive, or, as we may\r\nphrase it, the \"blanketing\" effect of the outer rock. The effect of\r\nthe strata is the same as that exercised by the non-conductive\r\ncoatings which are put on steam boilers. A more familiar comparison\r\nmay be had from the blankets used for bedclothing. If on top of the\r\nfirst blanket we put a second, we keep warmer because the temperature\r\nof the lower one is elevated by the heat from our body which is held\r\nin. In the crust of the earth each layer of rock resists the outflow\r\nof heat, and each addition lifts the temperature of all the layers\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nWhen water-bearing strata have been buried to the depth of ten miles,\r\nthe temperature of the mass may be expected to rise to somewhere\r\nbetween seven hundred and a thousand degrees Fahrenheit. If the depth\r\nattained should be fifty miles, it is likely that the temperature will\r\nbe five times as great. At such a heat the water which the rocks\r\ncontain tends in a very vigorous way to expand and pass into the state\r\nof vapour. This it can not readily do, because of its close\r\nimprisonment; we may say, however, that the tendency toward explosion\r\nis almost as great as that of ignited gunpowder. Such powder, if held\r\nin small spaces in a mass of cast steel, could be fired without\r\nrending the metal. The gases would be retained in a highly compressed,\r\npossibly in a fluid form. If now it happens that any of the strain in\r\nthe rocks such as lead to the production of faults produce fissures\r\nleading from the surface into this zone of heated water, the tendency\r\nof the rocks containing the fluid, impelled by its expansion, will be\r\nto move with great energy toward the point of relief or lessened\r\npressure which the crevice affords. Where rocks are in any way\r\nsoftened, pressure alone will force them into a cavity, as is shown by\r\nthe fact that beds of tolerably hard clay stones in deep coal mines\r\nmay be forced into the spaces by the pressure of the rocks which\r\noverlie them--in fact, the expense of cutting out these in-creeping\r\nrocks is in some British mines a serious item in the cost of the\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the water contained in the deep-lying heated rocks\r\nprobably is by far the most efficient agent in urging them toward the\r\nplane of escape which the fissure affords. When the motion begins it\r\npervades all parts of the rock at once, so that an actual flow is\r\ninduced. So far as the movement is due to the superincumbent weight,\r\nthe tendency is at once to increase the temperature of the moving\r\nmass. The result is that it may be urged into the fissure perhaps even\r\nhotter than when it started from the original bed place. In proportion\r\nas the rocky matter wins its way toward the surface, the pressure upon\r\nit diminishes, and the contained vapours are freer to expand. Taking\r\non the vaporous form, the bubbles gather to each other, and when they\r\nappear at the throat of the volcano they may, if the explosions be\r\ninfrequent, assume the character above noted in the little eruption of\r\nVesuvius. Where, however, the lava ascends rapidly through the\r\nchannel, it often attains the open air with so much vapour in it, and\r\nthis intimately mingled with the mass, that the explosion rends the\r\nmaterials into an impalpably fine powder, which may float in the air\r\nfor months before it falls to the earth. With a less violent movement\r\nthe vapour bubbles expand in the lava, but do not rend it apart, thus\r\nforming the porous, spongy rock known as pumice. With a yet slower\r\nascent a large part of the steam may go away, so that we may have a\r\nflow of lava welling forth from the vent, still giving forth steam,\r\nbut with a vapour whose tension is so lowered that the matter is not\r\nblown apart, though it may boil violently for a time after it escapes\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing relatively simple explanation of volcanic\r\naction can not be said as yet to be generally accepted by geologists,\r\nthe reasons are sufficient which lead us to believe that it accounts\r\nfor the main features which we observe in this class of explosions--in\r\nother words, it is a good working hypothesis. We shall now proceed in\r\nthe manner which should be followed in all natural inquiry to see if\r\nthe facts shown in the distribution of volcanoes in space and time\r\nconfirm or deny the view.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy feature in the distribution of volcanoes is that,\r\nat the present time at least, all active vents are limited to the sea\r\nfloors or to the shore lands within the narrow range of three hundred\r\nmiles from the coast. Wherever we find a coast line destitute of\r\nvolcanoes, as is the case with the eastern coast of North and South\r\nAmerica, it appears that the shore has recently been carried into the\r\nland for a considerable distance--in other words, old coast lines are\r\nnormally volcanic; that is, here and there have vents of this nature.\r\nThus the North Atlantic, the coasts of which appear to have gone\r\ninland for a great distance in geologically recent times, is\r\nnon-volcanic; while the Pacific coast, which for a long time has\r\nremained in its present position, has a singularly continuous line of\r\ncraters near the shore extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. So\r\nuninterrupted is this line of volcanoes that if they were all in\r\neruption it would very likely be possible to journey down the coast\r\nwithout ever being out of sight of the columns of vapour which they\r\nwould send forth. On the floor of the sea volcanic peaks appear to be\r\nvery widely distributed; only a few of them--those which attain the\r\nsurface of the water--are really known, but soundings show long lines\r\nof elevations which doubtless represent cones distributed along fault\r\nlines, none of the peaks of sufficient height to break the surface of\r\nthe sea. It is likely, indeed, that for one marine volcano which\r\nappears as an island there are scores which do not attain the surface.\r\nVolcanic islands exist and generally abound in the ocean and greater\r\nseas; every now and then we observe a new one forming as a small\r\nisland, which is apt to be washed away by the sea shortly after the\r\neruption ceases, the disappearance being speedy, for the reason that\r\nthe volcanic ashes of which these cones are composed drift away like\r\nsnow before the movement of the waves.\r\n\r\nIf the waters of the ocean and seas were drained away so that we could\r\ninspect the portion of the earth's surface which they cover as readily\r\nas we do the dry lands, the most conspicuous feature would be the\r\ninnumerable volcanic eminences which lie hidden in these watery\r\nrealms. Wherever the observer passed from the centres of the present\r\nlands he would note within the limits of those fields only mountains,\r\nmuch modified by river action; hills which the rivers had left in\r\nscarfing away the strata; and dales which had been carved out by the\r\nflowing waters. Near the shore lines of the vanished seas he would\r\nbegin to find mountains, hills, and vales occasionally commingled with\r\nvolcanic peaks, those structures built from the materials ejected from\r\nthe vents. Passing the coast line to the seaward, the hills and dales\r\nwould quickly disappear, and before long the mountains would vanish\r\nfrom his way, and he would gradually enter on a region of vast rolling\r\nplains beset by volcanic peaks, generally accumulated in long ranges,\r\nsomewhat after the manner of mountains, but differing from those\r\nelevations not only in origin but in aspect, the volcanic set of peaks\r\nbeing altogether made up of conical, cup-topped elevations.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show us that the fact of volcanoes being\r\nin the limit to the sea floors and to a narrow fringe of shore next\r\ncertain ocean borders is reconcilable with the view as to their\r\nformation which we have adopted. We have already noted the fact that\r\nthe continents are old, which implies that the parts of the earth\r\nwhich they occupy have long been the seats of tolerably continuous\r\nerosion. Now and then they have swung down partly beneath the sea, and\r\nduring their submersion they received a share of sediments. But, on\r\nthe whole, all parts of the lands except strips next the coast may be\r\nreckoned as having been subjected to an excess of wearing action far\r\nexceeding the depositional work. Therefore, as we readily see,\r\nunderneath such land areas there has been no blanketing process going\r\non which has served to increase the heat in the deep underlying rocks.\r\nOn the contrary, it would be easy to show, and the reader may see it\r\nhimself, that the progressive cooling of the earth has probably\r\nbrought about a lowering of the temperature in all the section from\r\nthe surface to very great depths, so that not only is the rock water\r\nunaffected by increase of heat, but may be actually losing\r\ntemperature. In other words, the conditions which we assume bring\r\nabout volcanic action do not exist beneath the old land.\r\n\r\nBeneath the seas, except in their very greatest depths, and perhaps\r\neven there, the process of forming strata is continually going on.\r\nNext the shores, sometimes for a hundred or two miles away to seaward,\r\nthe principal contribution may be the sediment worn from the lands by\r\nthe waves and the rivers. Farther away it is to a large extent made up\r\nof the remains of animals and plants, which when dying give their\r\nskeletons to form the strata. Much of the materials laid down--perhaps\r\nin all more than half--consist of volcanic dust, ashes, and pumice,\r\nwhich drifts very long times before it finds its way to the bottom. We\r\nhave as yet no data of a precise kind for determining the average rate\r\nof accumulation of sediments upon the sea floor, but from what is\r\nknown of the wearing of the lands, and the amount of volcanic waste\r\nwhich finds its way to the seas, it is probably not less than about a\r\nfoot in ten thousand years; it is most likely, indeed, much to exceed\r\nthis amount. From data afforded by the eruptions in Java and in other\r\nfields where the quantity of volcanic dust contributed to the seas can\r\nbe estimated, the writer is disposed to believe that the average rate\r\nof sedimentation on the sea floors is twice as great as the estimate\r\nabove given.\r\n\r\nAccumulating at the average rate of one foot in ten thousand years, it\r\nwould require a million years to produce a hundred feet of sediments;\r\na hundred million to form ten thousand feet, and five hundred million\r\nto create the thickness of about ten miles of bed. At the rate of two\r\nfeet in ten thousand years, the thickness accumulated would be about\r\ntwenty miles. When we come to consider the duration of the earth's\r\ngeologic history, we shall find reasons for believing that the\r\nformation of sediment may have continued for as much as five hundred\r\nmillion years.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing inquiries concerning the origin of volcanoes show that\r\nat the present time they are clearly connected with some process which\r\ngoes on beneath the sea. An extension of the inquiry indicates that\r\nthis relation has existed in earlier geological times; for, although\r\nthe living volcanoes are limited to places within three hundred miles\r\nof the sea, we find lava flows, ashes, and other volcanic\r\naccumulations far in the interior of the continents, though the energy\r\nwhich brought them forth to the earth's surface has ceased to operate\r\nin those parts of the land. In these cases of continental volcanoes it\r\ngenerally, if not always, appears that the cessation of the activity\r\nattended the removal of the shore line of the ocean or the\r\ndisappearance of great inland seas. Thus the volcanoes of the\r\nYellowstone district may have owed their activity to the immense\r\ndeposits of sediment which were formed in the vast fresh-water lakes\r\nwhich during the later Cretaceous and early Tertiary times stretched\r\nalong the eastern face of the Rocky Mountains, forming a Mediterranean\r\nSea in North America comparable to that which borders southern Europe.\r\nIt thus appears that the arrangement of volcanoes with reference to\r\nsea basins has held for a considerable period in the past. Still\r\nfurther, when we look backward through the successive formations of\r\nthe earth's crust we find here and there evidences in old lava flows,\r\nin volcanic ashes, and sometimes in the ruins of ancient cones which\r\nhave been buried in the strata, that igneous activity such as is now\r\ndisplayed in our volcanoes has been, since the earliest days of which\r\nwe have any record, a characteristic feature of the earth. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that this action has in the past been any greater or\r\nany less than in modern days. All these facts point to the conclusion\r\nthat volcanic action is due to the escape of rock water which has been\r\nheated to high temperatures, and which drives along with it as it\r\njourneys toward a crevice the rock in which it has been confined.\r\n\r\nWe will now notice some other explanations of volcanic action which\r\nhave obtained a certain credence. First, we may note the view that\r\nthese ejections from craters are forced out from a supposed liquid\r\ninterior of the earth. One of the difficulties of this view is that we\r\ndo not know that the earth's central parts are fluid--in fact, many\r\nconsiderations indicate that such is not the case. Next, we observe\r\nthat we not infrequently find two craters, each containing fluid lava,\r\nwith the fluid standing at differences of height of several thousand\r\nfeet, although the cones are situated very near each other. If these\r\nlavas came from a common internal reservoir, the principles which\r\ncontrol the action of fluids would cause the lavas to be at the same\r\nelevation. Moreover, this view does not provide any explanation of the\r\nfact that volcanoes are in some way connected with actions which go on\r\non the floors of great water basins. There is every reason to believe\r\nthat the fractures in the rocks under the land are as numerous and\r\ndeep-going as those beneath the sea. If it were a mere question of\r\naccess to a fluid interior, volcanoes should be equally distributed on\r\nland and sea floors. Last of all, this explanation in no wise accounts\r\nfor the intermixture of water with the fluid rock. We can not well\r\nbelieve that water could have formed a part of the deeper earth in the\r\nold days of original igneous fusion. In that time the water must have\r\nbeen all above the earth in the vaporous state.\r\n\r\nAnother supposition somewhat akin to that mentioned is that the water\r\nof the seas finds its way down through crevices beneath the floors of\r\nthe ocean, and, there coming in contact with an internal molten mass,\r\nis converted into steam, which, along with the fluid rock, escapes\r\nfrom the volcanic vent. In addition to the objections urged to the\r\npreceding view, we may say concerning this that the lava, if it came\r\nforth under these circumstances, would emerge by the short way, that\r\nby which the water went down, and not by the longer road, by which it\r\nmay be discharged ten thousand feet or more above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing general account of volcanic action should properly be\r\nfollowed by some account of what takes place in characteristic\r\neruptions. This history of these matters is so ample that it would\r\nrequire the space of a great encyclopædia to contain them. We shall\r\ntherefore be able to make only certain selections which may serve to\r\nillustrate the more important facts.\r\n\r\nBy far the best-known volcanic cone is that of Vesuvius, which has\r\nbeen subjected to tolerably complete record for about twenty-four\r\nhundred years. About 500 B.C. the Greeks, who were ever on the search\r\nfor places where they might advantageously plant colonies, settled on\r\nthe island of Ischia, which forms the western of what is now termed\r\nthe Bay of Naples. This island was well placed for tillage as well as\r\nfor commerce, but the enterprising colonists were again and again\r\ndisturbed by violent outbreaks of one or more volcanoes which lie in\r\nthe interior of this island; at one time it appears that the people\r\nwere driven away by these explosions.\r\n\r\nIn these pre-Christian days Vesuvius, then known as Monte Somma, was\r\nnot known to be a volcano, it never having shown any trace of\r\neruption. It appeared as a regularly shaped mountain, somewhat over\r\ntwo thousand feet high, with a central depression about three miles in\r\ndiameter at the top, and perhaps two miles over at the bottom, which\r\nwas plainlike in form, with some lakes of bitter water in the centre.\r\nThe most we know of this central cavity is connected with the\r\ninsurrection of the slaves led by Spartacus, the army of the revolters\r\nhaving camped for a time on the plain encircled by the crater walls.\r\nThe outer slopes of the mountain afforded then a remarkably fertile\r\nsoil; some traces, indeed, of the fertility have withstood the modern\r\neruptions which have desolated its flanks. This wonderful Bay of\r\nNaples became the seat of the fairest Roman culture, as well as of a\r\nvery extended commerce. Toward the close of the first century of our\r\nera the region was perhaps richer, more beautifully cultivated, and\r\nthe seat of a more elaborate luxury than any part of the shore line of\r\nEurope at the present day. At the foot of the mountain, on the eastern\r\nborder of the bay, the city of Pompeii, with a population of about\r\nfifty thousand souls, was a considerable port, with an extensive\r\ncommerce, particularly with Egypt. The charming town was also a place\r\nof great resort for rich Egyptians who cared to dwell in Europe. On\r\nthe flanks of the mountain there was at least one large town,\r\nHerculaneum, which appears to have been an association of rich men's\r\nresidences. On the eastern side of the bay, at a point now known as\r\nBaiæ, the Roman Government had a naval station, which in the year 79\r\nwas under the command of the celebrated Pliny, a most voluminous\r\nthough unscientific writer on matters of natural history. With him in\r\nthat year there was his nephew, commonly known as the younger Pliny,\r\nthen a student of eighteen years, but afterward himself an author.\r\nThese facts are stated in some detail, for they are all involved in\r\nthe great tragedy which we are now to describe.\r\n\r\nFor many years there had been no eruption about the Bay of Naples. The\r\nvolcanoes on Ischia had been still for a century or more, and the\r\nvarious circular openings on the mainland had been so far quiet that\r\nthey were not recognised as volcanoes. Even the inquisitive Pliny,\r\nwith his great learning, was so little of a geologist that he did not\r\nknow the signs which indicate the seat of volcanic action, though they\r\nare among the most conspicuous features which can meet the eye. The\r\nGreeks would doubtless have recognised the meaning of these physical\r\nsigns. In the year 63 the shores of the Bay of Naples were subjected\r\nto a distinctive earthquake. Others less severe followed in subsequent\r\nyears. In an early morning in the year 79, a servant aroused the elder\r\nPliny at Baiæ with the news that there was a wonderful cloud rising\r\nfrom Monte Somma. The younger Pliny states that in form it was like a\r\npine tree, the common species in Italy having a long trunk with a\r\ncrown of foliage on its summit, shaped like an umbrella. This crown of\r\nthe column grew until it spread over the whole landscape, darkening\r\nthe field of view. Shortly after, a despatch boat brought a message to\r\nthe admiral, who at once set forth for the seat of the disturbance. He\r\ninvited his nephew to accompany him, but the prudent young man relates\r\nin his letters to Tacitus, from whom we know the little concerning the\r\neruption which has come down to us, that he preferred to do some\r\nreading which he had to attend to. His uncle, however, went straight\r\nforward, intending to land at some point on the shore at the foot of\r\nthe cone. He found the sea, however, so high that a landing was\r\nimpossible; moreover, the fall of rock fragments menaced the ship. He\r\ntherefore cruised along the shore for some distance, landing at a\r\nstation probably near the present village of Castellamare. At this\r\npoint the fall of ashes and pumice was very great, but the sturdy old\r\nRoman had his dinner and slept after it. There is testimony that he\r\nsnored loudly, and was aroused only when his servants began to fear\r\nthat the fall of ashes and stones would block the way out of his\r\nbedchamber. When he came forth with his attendants, their heads\r\nprotected by planks resting on pillows, he set out toward Pompeii,\r\nwhich was probably the place where he sought to land. After going some\r\ndistance, the brave man fell dead, probably from heart disease; it is\r\nsaid that he was at the time exceedingly asthmatic. No sooner were his\r\nservants satisfied that the life had passed from his body than they\r\nfled. The remains were recovered after the eruption had ceased. The\r\nyounger Pliny further relates that after his uncle left, the cloud\r\nfrom the mountain became so dense that in midday the darkness was that\r\nof midnight, and the earthquake shocks were so violent that wagons\r\nbrought to the courtyard of the dwelling to bear the members of the\r\nhousehold away were rolled this way and that by the quakings of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nSave for the above-mentioned few and unimportant details concerning\r\nthe eruption, we have no other contemporaneous account. We have,\r\nindeed, no more extended story until Dion Cassius, writing long after\r\nthe event, tells us that Herculaneum and Pompeii were overwhelmed; but\r\nhe mixes his story with fantastic legends concerning the appearance of\r\ngods and demons, as is his fashion in his so-called history. Of all\r\nthe Roman writers, he is perhaps the most untrustworthy. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, we have in the deposits of ashes which were thrown out at the\r\ntime of this great eruption some basis for interpreting the events\r\nwhich took place. It is evident that for many hours the Vesuvian\r\ncrater, which had been dormant for at least five hundred years, blew\r\nout with exceeding fury. It poured forth no lava streams; the energy\r\nof the uprushing vapours was too great for that. The molten rock in\r\ntheir path was blown into fine bits, and all the hard material cast\r\nforth as free dust. In the course of the eruption, which probably did\r\nnot endure more than two days, possibly not more than twenty-four\r\nhours, ash enough was poured forth to form a thick layer which spread\r\nfar over the neighbouring area of land and sea floor. It covered the\r\ncities of Herculaneum and Pompeii to a depth of more than twenty feet,\r\nand over a circle having a diameter of twenty miles the average\r\nthickness may have been something like this amount. So deep was it\r\nthat, although almost all the people of these towns survived, it did\r\nnot seem to them worth while to undertake to excavate their dwelling\r\nplaces. At Pompeii the covering did not overtop the higher of the low\r\nhouses. An amount of labour which may be estimated at not over one\r\nthirtieth of the value, or at least the cost which had been incurred\r\nin building the city, would have restored it to a perfectly\r\ninhabitable state. The fact that it was utterly abandoned probably\r\nindicates a certain superstitious view in connection with the\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the people had time to flee from Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii, bearing with them their more valuable effects, is proved by\r\nthe excavations at these places which have been made in modern times.\r\nThe larger part of Pompeii and a considerable portion of Herculaneum\r\nhave been thus explored; only rarely have human remains been found.\r\nHere and there, particularly in the cellars, the labourers engaged in\r\nthe work of disinterring the cities note that their picks enter a\r\ncavity; examining the space, they find they have discovered the\r\nremains of a human skeleton. It has recently been learned that by\r\npouring soft plaster of Paris into these openings a mould may be\r\nobtained which gives in a surprisingly perfect manner the original\r\nform of the body. The explanation of this mould is as follows: Along\r\nwith the fall of cinders in an eruption there is always a great\r\ndescent of rain, arising from the condensation of the steam which\r\npours forth from the volcano. This water, mingling with the ashes,\r\nforms a pasty mud, which often flows in vast streams, and is\r\nsometimes known as mud lava. This material has the qualities of\r\ncement--that is, it shortly \"sets\" in a manner comparable to plaster\r\nof Paris or ordinary mortar. During the eruption of 79 this mud\r\npenetrated all the low places in Pompeii, covering the bodies of the\r\npeople, who were suffocated by the fumes of the volcanic emanations.\r\nWe know that these people were not drowned by the inundation; their\r\nattitudes show that they were dead before the flowing matter\r\npenetrated to where they lay.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Pompeii lay beyond the influence of the subsequent\r\ngreat eruptions of Vesuvius, so that it afterward received only slight\r\nash showers. Herculaneum, on the other hand, has century by century\r\nbeen more and more deeply buried until at the present time it is\r\ncovered by many sheets of lava. This is particularly to be regretted,\r\nfor the reason that, while Pompeii was a seaport town of no great\r\nwealth or culture, Herculaneum was the residence place of the gentry,\r\npeople who possessed libraries, the records of which can be in many\r\ncases deciphered, and from which we might hope to obtain some of the\r\nlost treasures of antiquity. The papyrus rolls on which the books of\r\nthat day were written, though charred by heat and time, are still\r\ninterpretable.\r\n\r\nAfter the great explosion of 79, Vesuvius sank again into repose. It\r\nwas not until 1056 that vigorous eruptions again began. From time to\r\ntime slight explosions occurred, none of which yielded lava flows; it\r\nwas not until the date last mentioned that this accompaniment of the\r\neruption began to appear. In 1636, after a repose of nearly a century\r\nand a half, there came a very great outbreak, which desolated a wide\r\nextent of country on the northwestern side of the cone. At this stage\r\nin the history of the crater the volcanic flow began to attain the\r\nsea. Washing over the edge of the old original crater of Monte Somma,\r\nand thus lowering its elevation, these streams devastated, during the\r\neruption just mentioned and in various other outbreaks, a wide field\r\nof cultivated land, overwhelming many villages. The last considerable\r\neruption which yielded large quantities of lava was that of 1872,\r\nwhich sent its tide for a distance of about six miles.\r\n\r\nSince 1636 the eruptions of Vesuvius have steadily increased in\r\nfrequency, and, on the whole, diminished in violence. In the early\r\nyears of its history the great outbreaks were usually separated by\r\nintervals of a century or more, and were of such energy that the lava\r\nwas mostly blown to dust, forming clouds so vast that on two occasions\r\nat least they caused a midnight darkness at Constantinople, nearly\r\ntwelve hundred miles away. This is as if a volcano at Chicago should\r\ncompletely hide the sun in the city of Boston. In the present state of\r\nVesuvius, the cone may be said to be in slight, almost continuous\r\neruption. The old central valley which existed before the eruption of\r\n79, and continued to be distinct for long after that time, has been\r\nfilled up by a smaller cone, bearing a relatively tiny crater of vent,\r\nthe original wall being visible only on the eastern and northern parts\r\nof its circuit, and here only with much diminished height. On the\r\nwestern face the slope from the base of the mountain to the summit of\r\nthe new cone is almost continuous, though the trained eye can trace\r\nthe outline of Monte Somma--its position in a kind of bench, which is\r\ntraceable on that side of the long slope leading from the summit of\r\nthe new cone to the sea. The fact that the lavas of Vesuvius have\r\nbroken out on the southwestern side, while the old wall of the cone\r\nhas remained unbroken on the eastern versant, has a curious\r\nexplanation. The prevailing wind of Naples is from the southwest,\r\nbeing the strong counter trades which belong in that latitude. In the\r\nold days when the Monte Somma cone was constructed these winds caused\r\nthe larger part of the ashes to fall on the leeward side of the cone,\r\nthus forming a thicker and higher wall around that part of the crater.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the recent eruptions of Vesuvius it appears likely\r\nthat the mountain is about to enter on a second period of inaction.\r\nThe pipes leading through the new cone are small, and the mass of this\r\nelevation constitutes a great plug, closing the old crater mouth. To\r\ngive vent to a large discharge of steam, the whole of this great mass,\r\nhaving a depth of nearly two thousand feet, would have to be blown\r\naway. It seems most likely that when the occasion for such a discharge\r\ncomes, the vapours of the eruption will seek a vent through some other\r\nof the many volcanic openings which lie to the westward of this great\r\ncone. The history of these lesser volcanoes points to the conclusion\r\nthat when the path by way of Vesuvius is obstructed they may give\r\nrelief to the steam which is forcing its course to the surface. Two or\r\nthree times since the eruption of Pliny, during periods when Vesuvius\r\nhad long been quiet, outbreaks have taken place on Ischia or in the\r\nPhlægræn Fields, a region dotted with small craters which lies to the\r\nwest of Naples. The last of these occurred in 1552, and led to the\r\nformation of the beautiful little cone known as Monte Nuovo. This\r\neruption took place near the town of Puzzuoli, a place which was then\r\nthe seat of a university, the people of which have left us records of\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Diagrammatic sections through Mount Vesuvius,\r\nshowing changes in the form of the cone. (From Phillips.)]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak which formed Monte Nuovo was slight but very\r\ncharacteristic. It occurred in and beside a circular pool known as the\r\nLucrine Lake, itself an ancient crater. At the beginning of the\r\ndisturbance the ground opened in ragged cavities, from which mud and\r\nashes and great fragments of hard rock were hurled high in the air,\r\nsome of the stones ascending to a height of several thousand feet.\r\nWith slight intermissions this outbreak continued for some days,\r\nresulting in the formation of a hill about five hundred feet high,\r\nwith a crater in its top, the bottom of which lay near the level of\r\nthe sea. Although this volcanic elevation, being made altogether of\r\nloose fragments, is rapidly wearing down, while the crater is filling\r\nup, it remains a beautiful object in the landscape, and is also\r\nnoteworthy for the fact that it is the only structure of this nature\r\nwhich we know from its beginning. In the Phlægræn Field there are a\r\nnumber of other craters of small size, with very low cones about them.\r\nThese appear to have been the product of brief, slight eruptions. That\r\nknown as the Solfatara, though not in eruption during the historic\r\nperiod, is interesting for the fact that from the crevices of the\r\nrocks about it there comes forth a continued efflux of carbonic-acid\r\ngas. This substance probably arises from the effect of heat contained\r\nin old lavas which are in contact with limestone in the deep\r\nunder-earth. We know such limestones are covered by the lavas of\r\nVesuvius, for the reason that numerous blocks of the rock are thrown\r\nout during eruptions, and are often found embedded in the lava\r\nstreams. It is an interesting fact that these craters of the\r\nPhlægræn Field, lying between the seats of vigorous eruption on\r\nIschia and at Vesuvius, have never been in vigorous eruption. Their\r\nslight outbreaks seem to indicate that they have no permanent\r\nconnection with the sources whence those stronger vents obtain their\r\nsupply of heated steam.\r\n\r\nThe facts disclosed by the study of the Vesuvian system of volcanoes\r\nafford the geologist a basis for many interesting conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he notes that the greater part of the cones, all\r\nthose of small size, are made up of finely divided rock, which may\r\nhave been more or less cemented by the processes of change which\r\ngo on within it. It is thus clear that the lava flows are\r\nunessential--indeed, we may say accidental--contributions to the mass.\r\nIn the case of Vesuvius they certainly do not amount to as much as one\r\ntenth of the elevation due to the volcanic action. The share of the\r\nlava in Vesuvius is probably greater than the average, for during the\r\nlast six centuries this vent has been remarkably lavigerous.[8]\r\nObservation on the volcanoes of other districts show that the Vesuvian\r\ngroup is in this regard not peculiar. Of nearly two hundred cones\r\nwhich the writer has examined, not more than one tenth disclose\r\ndistinct lavas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: I venture to use this word in place of the phrase\r\n\"lava-yielding\" for the reason that the term is needed in the\r\ndescription of volcanoes.]\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the old inner wall of Monte Somma in that portion\r\nwhere it is best preserved, on the north side of the Atria del\r\nCavallo, or Horse Gulch--so called for the reason that those who\r\nascended Vesuvius were accustomed to leave their saddle animals\r\nthere--we perceive that the body of the old cone is to a considerable\r\nextent interlaced with dikes or fissures which have been filled with\r\nmolten lava that has cooled in its place. It is evident that during\r\nthe throes of an eruption, when the lava stands high in the crater,\r\nthese rents are frequently formed, to be filled by the fluid rock. In\r\nfact, lava discharges, though they may afterward course for long\r\ndistances in the open air, generally break their way underground\r\nthrough the cindery cone, and first are disclosed at the distance of a\r\nmile or more from the inner walls of the crater. Their path is\r\nprobably formed by riftings in the compacted ashes, such as we trace\r\non the steep sides of the Atria del Cavallo, as before noted. For the\r\nfurther history of these fissures, we shall have to refer to facts\r\nwhich are better exhibited in the cone of Ætna.\r\n\r\nThe amount of rock matter which has been thrown forth from the\r\nvolcanoes about the Bay of Naples is very great. Only a portion of it\r\nremains in the region around these cones; by far the greater part has\r\nbeen washed or blown away. After each considerable eruption a wide\r\nfield is coated with ashes, so that the tilled grounds appear as if\r\nentirely sterilized; but in a short time the matter in good part\r\ndisappears, a portion of it decays and is leached away, and the most\r\nof the remainder washes into the sea. Only the showers, which\r\naccumulate a deep layer, are apt to be retained on the surface of the\r\ncountry. A great deal of this powdered rock drifts away in the wind,\r\nsometimes in great quantities, as in those cases where it darkened the\r\nsky more than a thousand miles from the cone. Moreover, the water of\r\nthe steam which brought about the discharges and the other gases which\r\naccompanied the vapour have left no traces of their presence, except\r\nin the deep channels which the rain of the condensing steam have\r\nformed on the hillsides. Nevertheless, after all these subtractions\r\nare made, the quantity of volcanic matter remaining on the surface\r\nabout the Bay of Naples would, if evenly distributed, form a layer\r\nseveral hundred feet in thickness--perhaps, indeed, a thousand feet in\r\ndepth--over the territory in which the vents occur. All this matter\r\nhas been taken in relatively recent times from the depths of the\r\nearth. The surprising fact is that no considerable and, indeed, no\r\npermanent subsidence of the surface has attended this excavation. We\r\ncan not believe that this withdrawal of material from the under-earth\r\nhas resulted in the formation of open underground spaces. We know full\r\nwell that any such, if it were of considerable size, would quickly be\r\ncrushed in by the weight of the overlying rocks. We have, indeed, to\r\nsuppose that these steam-impelled lavas, which are driven toward the\r\nvent whence they are to go forth in the state of dust or fluid, come\r\nunderground from distances away, probably from beneath the floors of\r\nthe sea to the westward.\r\n\r\nAlthough the shores of the Bay of Naples have remained in general with\r\nunchanged elevation for about two thousand years, they have here and\r\nthere been subjected to slight oscillations which are most likely\r\nconnected with the movement of volcanic matter toward the vents where\r\nit is to find escape. The most interesting evidence of this nature is\r\nafforded by the studies which have been made on the ruins of the\r\nTemple of Serapis at Puzzuoli. This edifice was constructed in\r\npre-Christian times for the worship of the Egyptian god Serapis, whose\r\nintervention was sought by sick people. The fact that this divinity of\r\nthe Nile found a residence in this region shows how intimate was the\r\nrelation between Rome and Egypt in this ancient day. The Serapeium was\r\nbuilt on the edge of the sea, just above its level. When in modern\r\ndays it began to be studied, its floor was about on its original\r\nlevel, but the few standing columns of the edifice afford indubitable\r\nevidence that this part of the shore has been lowered to the amount of\r\ntwenty feet or more and then re-elevated. The subsidence is proved by\r\nthe fact that the upper part of the columns which were not protected\r\nby the _débris_ accumulated about them have been bored by certain\r\nshellfish, known as _Lithodomi_, which have the habit of excavating\r\nshelters in soft stone, such as these marble columns afford. At\r\npresent the floor on which the ruin stands appears to be gradually\r\nsinking, though the rate of movement is very slow.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence that the ejections may travel for a great distance\r\nunderground on their way to the vent is afforded by the fact that\r\nVesuvius and Ætna, though near three hundred miles apart, appear to\r\nexchange activities--that is, their periods of outbreak are not\r\nsimultaneous. Although these elements of the chronology of the two\r\ncones may be accidental, taken with similar facts derived from other\r\nfields, they appear to indicate that vents, though far separated from\r\neach other, may, so to speak, be fed from a common subterranean\r\nsource. It is a singular fact in this connection that the volcano of\r\nStromboli, though situated between these two cones, is in a state of\r\nalmost incessant activity. This probably indicates that the last-named\r\nvent derives its vapours from another level in the earth than the\r\ngreater cones. In this regard volcanoes probably behave like springs,\r\nof which, indeed, they may be regarded as a group. The reader is\r\ndoubtless aware that hot and cold springs often escape very near\r\ntogether, the difference in the temperature being due to the depth\r\nfrom which their waters come forth.\r\n\r\nAs the accidents of volcanic explosion are of a nature to be very\r\ndamaging to man, as well as to the lower orders of Nature, it is fit\r\nthat we should note in general the effect of the Neapolitan eruptions\r\non the history of civilization in that region. As stated above, the\r\nfirst Greek settlements in this vicinity--those on the island of\r\nIschia--were much disturbed by volcanic outbreaks, yet the island\r\nbecame the seat of a permanent and prosperous colony. The great\r\neruption of 79 probably cost many hundred lives, and led to the\r\nabandonment of two considerable cities, which, however, could at small\r\ncost have been recovered to use. Since that day various eruptions have\r\ntemporarily desolated portions of the territory, but only in very\r\nsmall fields have the ravages been irremediable. Where the ground was\r\ncovered with dust, it has in most places been again tillable, and so\r\nrapid is the decay of the lavas that in a century after their flow has\r\nceased vines can in most cases be planted on their surfaces. The city\r\nof Naples, which lies amid the vents, though not immediately in\r\ncontact with any of them, has steadfastly grown and prospered from the\r\npre-Christian times. It is doubtful if any lives have ever been lost\r\nin the city in consequence of an eruption, and no great inconvenience\r\nhas been experienced from them. Now and then, after a great ash\r\nshower, the volcanic dust has to be removed, but the labour is less\r\nserious than that imposed on many northern cities by a snowstorm.\r\nThrough all these convulsions the tillage of the district has been\r\nmaintained. It has ever been the seat of as rich and profitable a\r\nhusbandry as is afforded by any part of Italy. In fact, the ash\r\nshowers, as they import fine divided rock very rich in substances\r\nnecessary for the growth of plants, have in a measure served to\r\nmaintain the fertility of the soil, and by this action have in some\r\ndegree compensated for the injury which they occasionally inflict.\r\nComparing the ravages of the eruptions with those inflicted by war,\r\nunnecessary disease, or even bad politics, and we see that these\r\nnatural accidents have been most merciful to man. Many a tyrant has\r\ncaused more suffering and death than has been inflicted by these rude\r\noperations of Nature.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the naturalist, Ætna is vastly more\r\ninteresting than Vesuvius. The bulk of the cone is more than twenty\r\ntimes as great as that of the Neapolitan volcano, and the magnitude of\r\nits explosions, as well as the range of phenomena which they exhibit,\r\nincomparably greater. It happens, however, that while human history of\r\nthe recorded kind has been intimately bound up with the tiny Vesuvian\r\ncone, partly because the relatively slight nature of its disturbances\r\npermitted men to dwell beside it, the larger Ætna has expelled culture\r\nfrom the field near its vent, and has done the greater part of its\r\nwork in the vast solitude which it has created.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In part the excellent record of Vesuvius is due to the fact\r\nthat since the early Christian centuries the priests of St. Januarius,\r\nthe patron of Naples, have been accustomed to carry his relics in\r\nprocession whenever an eruption began. The cessation of the outbreak has\r\nbeen written down to the credit of the saint, and thus we are provided\r\nwith a long story of the successive outbreaks.]\r\n\r\nÆtna has been in frequent eruption for a very much longer time than\r\nVesuvius. In the odes of Pindar, in the sixth century before Christ,\r\nwe find records of eruptions. It is said also that the philosopher\r\nEmpedocles sought fame and death by casting himself into the fiery\r\ncrater. There has thus in the case of this mountain been no such long\r\nperiod of repose as occurred in Vesuvius. Though our records of the\r\noutbreaks are exceedingly imperfect, they serve to show that the vent\r\nhas maintained its activity much more continuously than is ordinarily\r\nthe case with volcanoes. Ætna is characteristically a lava-yielding\r\ncone; though the amount of dust put forth is large, the ratio of the\r\nfluid rock which flows away from the crater is very much greater than\r\nat Vesuvius. Nearly half the cone, indeed, may be composed of this\r\nmaterial. Our space does not permit anything like a consecutive story\r\nof the Ætnean eruptions since the dawn of history, or even a full\r\naccount of its majestic cone; we can only note certain features of a\r\nparticularly instructive nature which have been remarked by the many\r\nable men who have studied this structure and the effects of its\r\noutbreak.\r\n\r\nThe most important feature exhibited by Ætna is the vast size of its\r\ncone. At its apex its height, though variable from the frequent\r\ndestruction and rebuilding of the crater walls, may be reckoned as\r\nabout eleven thousand feet. The base on which the volcanic material\r\nlies is probably less than a thousand feet above the sea, so that the\r\nmaximum thickness of the heap of volcanic ejections is probably about\r\ntwo miles. The average depth of this coating is probably about five\r\nthousand feet, and, as the cone has an average diameter of about\r\nthirty miles, we may conclude that the cone now contains about a\r\nthousand cubic miles of volcanic materials. Great as is this mass,\r\nit is only a small part of the ejected material which has gone forth\r\nfrom the vent. All the matter which in its vaporous state went forth\r\nwith the eruption, the other gases and vapours thus discharged, have\r\ndisappeared. So, too, a large part of the ash and much of the lava has\r\nbeen swept away by the streams which drain the region, and which in\r\ntimes of eruption are greatly swollen by the accompanying torrential\r\nrains. The writer has estimated that if all the emanations from the\r\nvolcano--solid, fluid, and gaseous--could be heaped on the cone, they\r\nwould form a mass of between two and three thousand cubic miles in\r\ncontents. Yet notwithstanding this enormous outputting of earthy\r\nmatter, the earth on which the Ætnean cone has been constructed has\r\nnot only failed to sink down, but has been in process of continuous,\r\nslow uprising, which has lifted the surface more than a thousand feet\r\nabove the level which it had at the time when volcanic action began in\r\nthis field. Here, even more clearly than in the case of Vesuvius, we\r\nsee that the materials driven forth from the crater are derived not\r\nfrom just beneath its foundation, but from a distance, from realms\r\nwhich in the case of this insular volcano are beneath the sea floors.\r\nIt is certain that here the migration of rock matter, impelled by the\r\nexpansion of its contained water toward the vent, has so far exceeded\r\nthat which has been discharged through the crater that an uprising of\r\nthe surface such as we have observed has been brought about.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mount Ætna, seen from near Catania. The imperfect\r\ncones on the sky line to the left are those of small secondary\r\neruptions._]\r\n\r\nThere are certain peculiarities of Mount Ætna which are due in part to\r\nits great size and in part to the climatal conditions of the region in\r\nwhich it lies. The upper part of the mountain in winter is deeply\r\nsnow-clad; the frozen water often, indeed, forms great drifts in the\r\ngorges near the summit. Here it has occasionally happened that a layer\r\nof ashes has deeply buried the mass, so that it has been preserved for\r\nyears, becoming gradually more inclosed by the subsequent eruptions.\r\nAt one point where this compact snow--which has, indeed, taken on the\r\nform of ice--has been revealed to view, it has been quarried and\r\nconveyed to the towns upon the seacoast. It is likely that there are\r\nmany such masses of ice inclosed between the ash layers in the upper\r\npart of the mountain, where, owing to the height, the climate is very\r\ncold. This curious fact shows how perfect a non-conductor the ash beds\r\nof a volcano are to protect the frozen water from the heat of the\r\nrocks about the crater.\r\n\r\nThe furious rains which beset the mountain in times of great eruptions\r\nexcavate deep channels on its sides. The lava outbreaks which attend\r\nalmost every eruption, and which descend from the base of the cinder\r\ncone at the height of from five to eight thousand feet above the sea,\r\nnaturally find their way into these channels, where they course in the\r\nmanner of rivers until the lower and less valleyed section of the cone\r\nis reached.\r\n\r\nSuch a lava flow naturally begins to freeze on the surface, the lava\r\nat first becoming viscid, much in the manner of cream on the surface\r\nof milk. Urged along by the more fluid lava underneath, this viscid\r\ncoating takes a ropy or corrugated form. As the freezing goes deeper,\r\na firm stone roof may be formed across the gorge, which, when the\r\ncurrent of lava ceases to flow from the crater, permits the lower part\r\nof the stream to drain away, leaving a long cavern or scries of caves\r\nextending far up the cone. The nature of this action is exactly\r\ncomparable to that which we may observe when on a frosty morning after\r\nrain we may find the empty channels which were occupied by rills of\r\nwater roofed over with ice; the ice roofs are temporary, while those\r\nof lava may endure for ages. Some of these lava-stream caves have been\r\ndisclosed, in the manner of ordinary caverns, by the falling of their\r\nroofs; but the greater part are naturally hidden beneath the\r\never-increasing materials of the cone.\r\n\r\nThe lava-stream caves of Ætna are not only interesting because of\r\ntheir peculiarities of form, which we shall not undertake to describe,\r\nbut also for the reason that they help us to account for a very\r\npeculiar feature in the history of the great cone. On the slopes of\r\nthe volcano, below the upper cindery portion, there are several\r\nhundred lesser cones, varying from a few score to seven hundred feet\r\nin height. Each of these has its appropriate crater, and has evidently\r\nbeen the seat of one or more eruptions. As the greater part of these\r\ncones are ancient, many of them being almost effaced by the rain or\r\nburied beneath the ejections which have surrounded their bases since\r\nthe time they were formed, we are led to believe that many thousands\r\nof them have been formed during the history of the volcano. The\r\nhistory of these subsidiary cones appears to be connected with the\r\nlava caves noted above. These caverns, owing to the irregularities of\r\ntheir form, contain water. They are, in fact, natural cisterns, where\r\nthe abundant rainfall of the mountain finds here and there storage.\r\nWhen, during the throes of an eruption, dikes such as we know often to\r\npenetrate the mountain, are riven outward from the crater through the\r\nmass of the cone, and filled with lava, the heated rock must often\r\ncome in contact with these masses of buried water. The result of this\r\nwould inevitably be the local generation of steam at a high\r\ntemperature, which would force its way out in a brief but vigorous\r\neruption, such as has been observed to take place when these\r\nperipheral volcanoes are formed. Sometimes it has happened that after\r\nthe explosion the lava has found its way in a stream from the fissure\r\nthus opened. That this explanation is sufficient is in a measure shown\r\nby observations on certain effects of lava flows from Vesuvius. The\r\nwriter was informed by a very judicious observer, a resident of\r\nNaples, who had interested himself in the phenomena of that volcano,\r\nthat the lava streams when they penetrated a cistern, such as they\r\noften encounter in passing over villages or farmsteads, vaporized the\r\nwater, and gave rise, through the action of the steam, to small\r\ntemporary cones, which, though generally washed away by the further\r\nflow of the liquid rock, are essentially like those which we find on\r\nÆtna. Such subsidiary, or, as they are sometimes called, parasitic\r\ncones, are known about other volcanoes, but nowhere are they so\r\ncharacteristic as on the flanks of that wonderful volcano.\r\n\r\nA very conspicuous feature in the Ætnean cone consists of a great\r\nvalley known as the Val del Bove, or Bull Hollow, which extends from\r\nthe base of the modern and ever-changeable cinder cone down the flanks\r\nof the older structure to near its base. This valley has steep sides,\r\nin places a thousand or more feet high, and has evidently been formed\r\nby the down-settling of portions of the cone which were left without\r\nsupport by the withdrawal from beneath them of materials cast forth in\r\na time of explosion. In an eruption this remarkable valley was the\r\nseat of a vast water flood, the fluid being cast forth from the crater\r\nat the beginning of the explosion. In the mouths of this and other\r\nvolcanoes, after a long period of repose, great quantities of water,\r\ngathering from rains or condensed from the steam which slowly escapes\r\nfrom these openings, often pours like a flood down the sides of the\r\nmountains. In the great eruption of Galongoon, in Java, such a mass of\r\nwater, cast forth by a terrific explosion, mingled with ashes, so that\r\nthe mass formed a thick mud, was shot forth with such energy that it\r\nravaged an area nearly eighty miles in diameter, destroying the\r\nforests and their wild inhabitants, as well as the people who dwelt\r\nwithin the range of the amazing disaster. So powerfully was this water\r\ndriven from the crater that the districts immediately at the base of\r\nthe cone were in a manner overshot by the vast stream, and escaped\r\nwith relatively little injury.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes forth from the base of the cinder cone, or from one of\r\nthe small peripheral craters, the lava stream usually appears to be\r\nwhite hot, and to flow with almost the ease of water. It does not\r\nreally have that measure of fluidity; its condition is rather that of\r\nthin paste; but the great weight of the material--near two and a half\r\ntimes that of water--causes the movement down the slope to be speedy.\r\nThe central portion of the lava stream long retains its high\r\ntemperature; but the surface, cooling, is first converted into a tough\r\nsheet, which, though it may bend, can hardly be said to flow. Further\r\nhardening converts these outlying portions of the current into hard,\r\nglassy stone, which is broken into fragments in a way resembling the\r\nice on the surface of a river. It thus comes about that the advancing\r\nfront of the lava stream becomes covered, and its motion hindered by\r\nthe frozen rock, until the rate of ongoing may not exceed a few feet\r\nan hour, and the appearance is that of a heap of stone slowly rolling\r\ndown a slope. Now and then a crevice is formed, through which a thin\r\nstream of liquid lava pours forth, but the material, having already\r\nparted with much of its heat, rapidly cools, and in turn becomes\r\ncovered with the coating of frozen fragments. In this state of the\r\nstream the lava flow stands on all sides high above the slope which it\r\nis traversing; it is, in fact, walled in by its own solidified parts,\r\nthough it is urged forward by the contribution which continues to flow\r\nin the under arches. In this state of the movement trifling accidents,\r\nor even human interference, may direct the current this way or that.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting chapters in the history of Ætna relate to\r\nthe efforts of the people to turn these slow-moving streams so that\r\ntheir torrents might flow into wilderness places rather than over the\r\nfields and towns. In the great flow of 1669, which menaced the city of\r\nCatania, a large place on the seashore to the southeast of the cone, a\r\npublic-spirited citizen, Señor Papallardo, protecting himself and his\r\nservants with clothing made of hides, and with large shields, set\r\nforth armed with great hooks with the purpose of diverting the course\r\nof the lava mass. He succeeded in pulling away the stones on the\r\nflank of the stream, so that a flow of the molten rock was turned in\r\nanother direction. The expedient would probably have been successful\r\nif he had been allowed to continue his labours; but the inhabitants of\r\na neighbouring village, which was threatened by the off-shooting\r\ncurrent which Papallardo had created, took up arms and drove him and\r\nhis retainers away. The flow continued until it reached Catania. The\r\npeople made haste to build the city walls on the side of danger higher\r\nthan it was before, but the tide mounted over its summit.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lavas which come forth from the volcano evidently have a\r\nhigh temperature, their capacity for melting other rocks is relatively\r\nsmall. They scour these rocks, because of their weight, even more\r\nenergetically than do powerful torrents of water, but they are\r\nrelatively ineffective in melting stone. On Ætna and elsewhere we may\r\noften observe lavas which have flowed through forests. When the tide\r\nof molten rock has passed by, the trees may be found charred but not\r\nentirely burned away; even stems a few inches in diameter retain\r\nstrength enough to uphold considerable fringes and clots of the lava\r\nwhich has clung to them. These facts bear out the conclusion that the\r\nfluidity of the heated stone depends in considerable measure on the\r\nwater which is contained, either in its fluid or vaporous state,\r\nbetween the particles of the material.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the Italian volcanoes as a whole, we find that they lie\r\nin a long, discontinuous line extending from the northern part of the\r\nvalley of the Po, within sight of the Alps, to Ætna, and in\r\nsubterranean cones perhaps to the northern coast of Africa. At the\r\nnorthern end of the line we have a beautiful group of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, known as the Eugean Mountains. Thence southward to southern\r\nTuscany craters are wanting, but there is evidence of fissures in the\r\nearth which give forth thermal waters. From southern Tuscany southward\r\nthrough Rome to Naples there are many extinct craters, none of which\r\nhave been active in the historic period. From Naples southward the\r\ncones of this system, about a dozen in number, are on islands or close\r\nto the margin of the sea. It is a noteworthy fact that the greater\r\npart of these shore or insular vents have been active since the dawn\r\nof history; several of them frequently and furiously so, while none of\r\nthose occupying an inland position have been the seat of explosions.\r\nThis is a striking instance going to show the relation of these\r\nprocesses to conditions which are brought about on the sea bottom.\r\n\r\nÆtna is, as we have noticed, a much more powerful volcano than\r\nVesuvius. Its outbreaks are more vigorous, its emanations vastly\r\ngreater in volume, and the mass of its constructions many times as\r\ngreat as those accumulated in any other European cone. There are,\r\nhowever, a number of volcanoes in the world which in certain features\r\nsurpass Ætna as much as that crater does Vesuvius. Of these we shall\r\nconsider but two--Skaptar Jokul, of Iceland, remarkable for the volume\r\nof its lava flow, and Krakatoa, an island volcano between Java and\r\nSumatra, which was the seat of the greatest explosion of which we have\r\nany record.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Iceland may be regarded as a volcanic mass composed\r\nmainly of lavas and ashes which have been thrown up by a group of\r\nvolcanoes lying near the northern end of the long igneous axis which\r\nextends through the centre of the Atlantic. The island has been the\r\nseat of numerous eruptions; in fact, since its settlement by the\r\nNorthmen in 1070 its sturdy inhabitants have been almost as much\r\ndistressed by the calamities which have come from the internal heat as\r\nthey have been by the enduring external cold. They have, indeed, been\r\nbetween frost and fire. The greatest recorded eruption of Iceland\r\noccurred in 1783, when the volcano of Skaptar, near the southern\r\nborder of the island, poured forth, first, a vast discharge of dust\r\nand ashes, and afterward in the languid state of eruption inundated a\r\nseries of valleys with the greatest lava flow of which we have any\r\nwritten record. The dust poured forth into the upper air, being finely\r\ndivided and in enormous quantity, floated in the air for months,\r\ngiving a dusky hue to the skies of Europe, which led the common people\r\nand many of the learned to fear that the wrath of God was upon them,\r\nand that the day of judgment was at hand. Even the poet Cowper, a man\r\nof high culture and education, shared in this unreasonable view.\r\n\r\nThe lava flow in this eruption filled one of the considerable valleys\r\nof the island, drying up the river, and inundating the plains on\r\neither side. Estimates which have been made as to the volume of this\r\nflow appear to indicate that it may have amounted to more than the\r\nbulk of the Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nThis great eruption, by the direct effect of the calamity, and by the\r\nfamine due to the ravaging of the fields and the frightening of the\r\nfish from the shores which it induced, destroyed nearly one fifth of\r\nthe Icelandic people. It is, in fact, to be remembered as one of the\r\nthree or four most calamitous eruptions of which we have any account,\r\nand, from the point of view of lava flow, the greatest in history.\r\n\r\nJust a hundred years after the great Skaptar eruption, which darkened\r\nthe skies of Europe, the island of Krakatoa, an isle formed by a small\r\nvolcano in the straits of Java, was the seat of a vapour explosion\r\nwhich from its intensity is not only unparalleled, but almost\r\nunapproached in all accounts of such disturbances. Krakatoa had long\r\nbeen recognised as a volcanic isle; it is doubtful, however, if it had\r\never been seen in eruption during the three centuries or more since\r\nEuropean ships began to sail by it until the month of May of the year\r\nabove mentioned. Then an outbreak of what may be called ordinary\r\nviolence took place, which after a few days so far ceased that\r\nobservers landed and took account of the changes which the convulsion\r\nhad brought about. For about three months there were no further signs\r\nof activity, but on the 29th of August a succession of vast explosions\r\ntook place, which blew away a great part of the island, forming in its\r\nplace a submarine crater two or three miles in diameter, creating\r\nworld-wide disturbances of sea and air. The sounds of the outbreak\r\nwere heard at a distance of sixteen hundred miles away. The waves of\r\nthe air attendant on the explosion ran round the earth at least once,\r\nas was distinctly indicated by the self-recording barometers; it is\r\npossible, indeed, that, crossing each other in their east and west\r\ncourses, these atmospheric tides twice girdled the sphere. In effect,\r\nthe air over the crater was heaved up to the height of some tens of\r\nthousands of feet, and thence rolled off in great circular waves, such\r\nas may be observed in a pan of milk when a sharp blow pushes the\r\nbottom upward.\r\n\r\nThe violent stroke delivered to the waters of the sea created a vast\r\nwave, which in the region where it originated rolled upon the shores\r\nwith a surf wall fifty or more feet high. In a few minutes about\r\nthirty thousand people were overwhelmed. The wave rolled on beyond its\r\ndestructive limits much in the manner of the tide; its influence was\r\nfelt in a sharp rise and fall of the waters as far as the Pacific\r\ncoast of North America, and was indicated by the tide gauges in the\r\nAtlantic as far north as the coast of Europe.\r\n\r\nOwing to the violence of the eruption, Krakatoa poured forth no lava,\r\nbut the dust and ashes which ascended into the air--or, in\r\nother words, the finely divided lava which escaped into the\r\natmosphere--probably amounted in bulk to more than twenty cubic miles.\r\nThe coarser part of this material, including much pumice, fell upon\r\nthe seas in the vicinity, where, owing to its lightness, it was free\r\nto drift in the marine currents far and wide throughout the oceanic\r\nrealm. The finer particles, thrown high into the air, perhaps to the\r\nheight of nearly a hundred thousand feet--certainly to the elevation\r\nof more than half this amount--drifted far and wide in the\r\natmosphere, so that for years the air of all regions was clouded by\r\nit, the sunrise and sunset having a peculiar red glow, which the dust\r\nparticles produce by the light which they reflect. In this period, at\r\nall times when the day was clear, the sun appeared to be surrounded by\r\na dusky halo. In time the greater part of this dust was drawn down by\r\ngravity, some portion of it probably falling on every square foot of\r\nthe earth. Since the disappearance of the characteristic phenomena\r\nwhich it produced in the atmosphere, European observers have noted the\r\nexistence of faint clouds lying in the upper part of the air at the\r\nheight of a hundred miles or more above the surface. These clouds,\r\nwhich were at first distinctly visible in the earliest stage of dawn\r\nand in the latest period of the sunset glow, seemed to be in rapid\r\nmotion to the eastward, and to be mounting higher above the earth. It\r\nhas been not unreasonably supposed that these shining clouds represent\r\nportions of the finest dust from Krakatoa, which has been thrown so\r\nfar above the earth's attraction that it is separating itself from the\r\nsphere. If this view be correct, it seems likely that we may look to\r\ngreat volcanic explosions as a source whence the dustlike particles\r\nwhich people the celestial spaces may have come. They may, in a word,\r\nbe due to volcanic explosions occurring on this and other celestial\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nThe question suggested above as to the possibility of volcanic\r\nejections throwing matter from the earth beyond the control of its\r\ngravitative energy is one of great scientific interest. Computations\r\n(not altogether trustworthy) show that a body leaving the earth's\r\nsurface under the conditions of a cannon ball fired vertically upward\r\nwould have to possess a velocity at the start of at least seven miles\r\na second in order to go free into space. It would at first sight seem\r\nthat we should be able to reckon whether volcanoes can propel earth\r\nmatter upward with this speed. In fact, however, sufficient data are\r\nnot obtainable; we only know in a general way that the column of\r\nvapour rises to the height of thirty or forty thousand feet, and this\r\nin eruptions of no great magnitude. In an accident such as that at\r\nKrakatoa, even if an observer were near enough to see clearly what was\r\ngoing on, the chance of his surviving the disturbance would be small.\r\nMoreover, the ascending vapours, owing to their expansion of the steam\r\nin the column, begin to fly out sideways on its periphery, so that the\r\nupper part of the central section in the discharge is not visible from\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nIt is in the central section of the uprushing mass, if anywhere, that\r\nthe dust might attain the height necessary to put it beyond the\r\nearth's attraction, bringing it fairly into the realm of the solar\r\nsystem, or to the position where its own motion and the attraction of\r\nthe other spheres would give it an independent orbital movement about\r\nthe sun, or perhaps about the earth. We can only say that observations\r\non the height of volcanic ejections are extremely desirable; they can\r\nprobably only be made from a balloon. An ascension thus made beyond\r\nthe cloud disk which the eruption produces might bring the observer\r\nwhere he could discern enough to determine the matter. Although the\r\nmovements of the rocky particles could not be observed, the colour\r\nwhich they would give to the heavens might tell the story which we\r\nwish to know. There is evidence that large masses of stone hurled up\r\nby volcanic eruption have fallen seven miles from the base of the\r\ncone. Assuming that the masses went straight upward at the beginning\r\nof their ascent, and that they were afterward borne outwardly by the\r\nexpansion of the column, computations which have a general but no\r\nabsolute value appear to indicate that the masses attained a height of\r\nfrom thirty to fifty miles, and had an initial velocity which, if\r\ndoubled, might have carried them into space.\r\n\r\nLast of all, we shall note the conditions which attend the eruptions\r\nof submarine volcanoes. Such explosions have been observed in but a\r\nfew instances, and only in those cases where there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the crater at the time of its explosion had attained to\r\nwithin a few hundred feet of the sea level. In these cases the\r\nejections, never as yet observed in the state of lava, but in the\r\ncondition of dust and pumice, have occasionally formed a low island,\r\nwhich has shortly been washed away by the waves. Knowing as we do that\r\nvolcanoes abound on the sea floor, the question why we do not oftener\r\nsee their explosions disturbing the surface of the waters is very\r\ninteresting, but not as yet clearly explicable. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that a volcanic discharge taking place at the depth of\r\nseveral thousand feet below the surface of the water would not be able\r\nto blow the fluid aside so as to open a pipe to the surface, but would\r\nexpend its energy in a hidden manner near the ocean floor. The vapours\r\nwould have to expand gradually, as they do in passing up through the\r\nrock pipe of a volcano, and in their slow upward passage might be\r\nabsorbed by the water. The solid materials thrown forth would in this\r\ncase necessarily fall close about the vent, and create a very steep\r\ncone, such, indeed, as we find indicated by the soundings off certain\r\nvolcanic islands which appear only recently to have overtopped the\r\nlevel of the waters.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, though inadequately from the diagrams of Vesuvius,\r\nvolcanic cones have a regularity and symmetry of form far exceeding\r\nthat afforded by the outlines of any other of the earth's features.\r\nWhere, as is generally the case, the shape of the cone is determined\r\nby the distribution of the falling cinders or divided lava which\r\nconstitutes the mass of most cones, the slope is in general that known\r\nas a catenary curve--i.e., the line formed by a chain hanging between\r\ntwo points at some distance from the vertical. It is interesting to\r\nnote that this graceful outline is a reflection or consequence of the\r\ncurve described by the uprushing vapour. The expansion in the\r\nascending column causes it to enlarge at a somewhat steadfast rate,\r\nwhile the speed of the ascent is ever diminishing. Precisely the same\r\naction can be seen in the like rush of steam and other gases and\r\nvapours from the cannon's mouth; only in the case of the gun, even of\r\nthe greatest size, we can not trace the movement for more than a few\r\nhundred feet. In this column of ejection the outward movement from the\r\ncentre carries the bits of lava outwardly from the centre of the\r\nshaft, so that when they lose their ascending velocity they are drawn\r\ndownward upon the flanks of the cone, the amount falling upon each\r\npart of that surface being in a general way proportional to the\r\nthickness of the vaporous mass from which they descend. The result is,\r\nthat the thickest part of the ash heap is formed on the upper part of\r\nthe crater, from which point the deposit fades away in depth in every\r\ndirection. In a certain measure the concentration toward the centre of\r\nthe cone is brought about by the draught of air which moves in toward\r\nthe ascending column.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in general, ejections of volcanic matter take place through\r\ncones, that being the inevitable form produced by the escaping steam,\r\nvery extensive outpourings of lava, ejections which in mass probably\r\nfar exceed those thrown forth through ordinary craters, are\r\noccasionally poured out through fissures in the earth's crust. Thus in\r\nOregon, Idaho, and Washington, in eastern Europe, in southern India,\r\nand at some other points, vast flows, which apparently took place from\r\nfissures, have inundated great realms with lava ejections. The\r\nconditions which appear to bring about these fissure eruptions of lava\r\nare not yet well understood. A provisional and very probable account\r\nof the action can be had in the hypothesis which will now be set\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nWhere any region has been for a long time the seat of volcanic action,\r\nit is probable that a large amount of rock in a more or less fluid\r\ncondition exists beneath its surface. Although the outrushing steam\r\nejects much of this molten material, there are reasons to suppose that\r\na yet greater part lies dormant in the underground spaces. Thus in the\r\ncase of Ætna we have seen that, though some thousands of miles of\r\nrock matter have come forth, the base of the cone has been uplifted,\r\nprobably by the moving to that region of more or less fluid rock. If\r\nnow a region thus underlaid by what we may call incipient lavas is\r\nsubjected to the peculiar compressive actions which lead to\r\nmountain-building, we should naturally expect that such soft material\r\nwould be poured forth, possibly in vast quantities through fault\r\nfissures, which are so readily formed in all kinds of rock when\r\nsubject to irregular and powerful strains, such as are necessarily\r\nbrought about when rocks are moved in mountain-making. The great\r\neruptions which formed the volcanic table-lands on the west coast of\r\nNorth America appear to have owed the extrusion of their materials to\r\nmountain-building actions. This seems to have been the case also in\r\nsome of those smaller areas where fissure flows occur in Europe. It is\r\nlikely that this action will explain the greater part of these massive\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nIt need not be supposed that the rock beneath these countries, which\r\nwhen forced out became lava, was necessarily in the state of perfect\r\nfluidity before it was forced through the fissures. Situated at great\r\ndepth in the earth, it was under a pressure so great that its\r\nparticles may have been so brought together that the material was\r\nessentially solid, though free to move under the great strains which\r\naffected it, and acquiring temperature along with the fluidity which\r\nheat induces as it was forced along by the mountain-building pressure.\r\nAs an illustration of how materials may become highly heated when\r\nforced to move particle on particle, it may be well to cite the case\r\nin which the iron stringpiece on top of a wooden dam near Holyoke,\r\nMass., was affected when the barrier went away in a flood. The iron\r\nstringer, being very well put together, was, it is said, drawn out by\r\nthe strain until it became sensibly reddened by the motion of its\r\nparticles, and finally fell hissing into the waters below. A like\r\nheating is observable when metal is drawn out in making wire. Thus a\r\nmass of imperfectly fluid rock might in a forced journey of a few\r\nmiles acquire a decided increase of temperature.\r\n\r\nAlthough the most striking volcanic action--all such phenomena,\r\nindeed, as commonly receives the name--is exhibited finally on the\r\nearth's surface, a great deal of work which belongs in the same group\r\nof geological actions is altogether confined to the deep-lying rock,\r\nand leads to the formation of dikes which penetrate the strata, but do\r\nnot rise to the open air. We have already noted the fact that dikes\r\nabound in the deeper parts of volcanic cones, though the fissures into\r\nwhich they find their way are seldom riven up to the surface. In the\r\nsame way beneath the ground in non-volcanic countries we may discover\r\nat a great depth in the older, much-changed rock a vast number of\r\nthese crevices, varying from a few inches to a hundred feet or more in\r\nwidth, which have been filled with lavas, the rock once molten having\r\nafterward cooled. In most cases these dikes are disclosed to us\r\nthrough the down-wearing of the earth that has removed the beds into\r\nwhich the dikes did not penetrate, thus disclosing the realm in which\r\nthe disturbances took place.\r\n\r\nWhere, as is occasionally the case in deep mines, or on some bare\r\nrocky cliff of great height, we can trace a dike in its upward course\r\nthrough a long distance, we find that we can never distinctly discover\r\nthe lower point of its extension. No one has ever seen in a clear way\r\nthe point of origin of such an injection. We can, however, often\r\nfollow it upward to the place where there was no longer a rift into\r\nwhich it could enter. In its upward path the molten matter appears\r\ngenerally to have followed some previously existing fracture, a joint\r\nplane or a fault, which generally runs through the rocks on those\r\nplanes. We can observe evidence that the material was in the state of\r\nigneous fluidity by the fact that it has baked the country rocks on\r\neither side of the fissure, the amount of baking being in proportion\r\nto the width of the dike, and thus to the amount of heat which it\r\ncould give forth. A dike six inches in diameter will sometimes barely\r\nsear its walls, while one a hundred feet in width will often alter the\r\nstrata for a great distance on either side. In some instances, as in\r\nthe coal beds near Richmond, Va., dikes occasionally cut through beds\r\nof bituminous coal. In these cases we find that the coal has been\r\nconverted into coke for many feet either side of a considerable\r\ninjection. The fact that the dike material was molten is still further\r\nshown by the occurrence in it of fragments which it has taken up from\r\nthe walls, and which may have been partly melted, and in most cases\r\nhave clearly been much heated.\r\n\r\nWhere dikes extend up through stratified beds which are separated from\r\neach other by distinct layers, along which the rock is not firmly\r\nbound together, it now and then happens, as noted by Mr. G.K. Gilbert,\r\nof the United States Geological Survey, that the lava has forced its\r\nway horizontally between these layers, gradually uplifting the\r\noverlying mass, which it did not break through, into a dome-shaped\r\nelevation. These side flows from dikes are termed laccolites, a word\r\nwhich signifies the pool-like nature of the stony mass which they form\r\nbetween the strata.\r\n\r\nIn many regions, where the earth has worn down so as to reveal the\r\nzone of dikes which was formed at a great depth, the surface of the\r\ncountry is fairly laced with these intrusions. Thus on Cape Ann, a\r\nrocky isle on the east coast of Massachusetts, having an area of about\r\ntwenty square miles, the writer, with the assistance of his colleague,\r\nProf. R.S. Tarr, found about four hundred distinct dikes exhibited on\r\nthe shore line where the rocks had been swept bare by the waves. If\r\nthe census of these intrusions could have been extended over the whole\r\nisland, it would probably have appeared that the total number exceeded\r\nfive thousand. In other regions square miles can be found where the\r\ndikes intercepted by the surface occupy an aggregate area greater than\r\nthat of the rocks into which they have been intruded.\r\n\r\nNow and then, but rarely, the student of dikes finds one where the\r\nbordering walls, in place of having the clean-cut appearance which\r\nthey usually exhibit, has its sides greatly worn away and much melted,\r\nas if by the long-continued passage of the igneous fluid through the\r\ncrevice. Such dikes are usually very wide, and are probably the paths\r\nthrough which lavas found their way to the surface of the earth,\r\npouring forth in a volcanic eruption. In some cases we can trace their\r\nrelation to ancient volcanic cones which have worn down in all their\r\npart which were made up of incoherent materials, so that there remains\r\nonly the central pipe, which has been preserved from decay by the\r\ncoherent character of the lava which filled it.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that dikes are driven upward into strata by the\r\npressure of the beds which overlie materials hot and soft enough to be\r\nput in motion when a fissure enters them, and that their movement\r\nupward through the crevice is accounted for by this pressure, makes\r\ncertain features of these intrusions comprehensible. Seeing that very\r\nlong, slender dikes are found penetrating the rock, which could not\r\nhave had a high temperature, it becomes difficult to understand how\r\nthe lava could have maintained its fluidity; but on the supposition\r\nthat it was impelled forward by a strong pressure, and that the energy\r\nthus transmitted through it was converted into heat, we discover a\r\nmeans whereby it could have been retained in the liquid condition,\r\neven when forced for long distances through very narrow channels.\r\nMoreover, this explanation accounts for the fact which has long\r\nremained unexplained that dikes, except those formed about volcanic\r\ncraters, rarely, if ever, rise to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe materials contained in dikes differ exceedingly in their chemical\r\nand mineral character. These variations are due to the differences in\r\nNature of the deposits whence they come, and also in a measure to\r\nexchanges which take place between their own substance and that of the\r\nrocks between which they are deposited. This process often has\r\nimportance of an economic kind, for it not infrequently leads to the\r\nformation of metalliferous veins or other aggregations of ores, either\r\nin the dike itself or in the country rock. The way in which this is\r\nbrought about may be easily understood by a familiar example. If flesh\r\nbe placed in water which has the same temperature, no exchange of\r\nmaterials will take place; but if the water be heated, a circulation\r\nwill be set up, which in time will bring a large part of the soluble\r\nmatter into the surrounding water. This movement is primarily\r\ndependent on differences of temperature, and consequently differences\r\nin the quantity of soluble substances which the water seeks to take\r\nup. When a dike is injected into cooler rocks, such a slow circulation\r\nis induced. The water contained in the interstices of the stone\r\nbecomes charged with mineral materials, if such exist in positions\r\nwhere it can obtain possession of them, and as cooling goes on, these\r\ndissolved materials are deposited in the manner of veins. These veins\r\nare generally laid down on the planes of contact between the two kinds\r\nof stone, but they may be formed in any other cavities which exist in\r\nthe neighbourhood. The formation of such veins is often aided by the\r\nconsiderable shrinkage of the lava in the dike, which, when it cools,\r\ntends to lose about fifteen per cent of its volume, and is thus likely\r\nto leave a crevice next the boundary walls. Ores thus formed afford\r\nsome of the commonest and often the richest mineral deposits. At\r\nLeadville, in Colorado, the great silver-bearing lodes probably were\r\nproduced in this manner, wherein lavas, either those of dikes or those\r\nwhich flowed in the open air, have come in contact with limestones.\r\nThe mineral materials originally in the once molten rock or in the\r\nlimy beds was, we believe, laid down on ancient sea floors in the\r\nremains of organic forms, which for their particular uses took the\r\nmaterials from the old sea water. The vein-making action has served to\r\nassemble these scattered bits of metal into the aggregation which\r\nconstitutes a workable deposit. In time, as the rocks wear down, the\r\nmaterials of the veins are again taken into solution and returned to\r\nthe sea, thence perhaps to tread again the cycle of change.\r\n\r\nIn certain dikes, and sometimes also, perhaps, in lavas known as\r\nbasalts, which have flowed on the surface, the rock when cooling, from\r\nthe shrinkage which then occurs, has broken in a very regular way,\r\nforming hexagonal columns which are more or less divided on their\r\nlength by joints. When worn away by the agencies of decay, especially\r\nwhere the material forms steep cliffs, a highly artificial effect is\r\nproduced, which is often compared, where cut at right angles to the\r\ncolumns, to pavements, or, where the division is parallel to the\r\ncolumns, to the pipes of an organ.\r\n\r\nWhat we know of dikes inclines us to the opinion that as a whole they\r\nrepresent movements of softened rock where the motion-compelling agent\r\nis not mainly the expansion of the contained water which gives rise to\r\nvolcanic ejection, but rather in large part due to the weight of\r\nsuperincumbent strata setting in motion materials which were somewhat\r\nsoftened, and which tended to creep, as do the clays in deep coal\r\nmines. It is evident, however; it is, moreover, quite natural, that\r\ndike work is somewhat mingled with that produced by the volcanic\r\nforces; but while the line between the two actions is not sharp, the\r\ndiscrimination is important, and occurs with a distinctness rather\r\nunusual on the boundary line between two adjacent fields of phenomena.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the general effects of the earth's interior\r\nheat so far as that body of temperature tends to drive materials from\r\nthe depths of the earth to the surface. This group of influences is\r\none of the most important which operates on our sphere; as we shall\r\nshortly see, without such action the earth would in time become an\r\nunfit theatre for the development of organic life. To perceive the\r\neffect of these movements, we must first note that in the great\r\nrock-constructing realm of the seas organic life is constantly\r\nextracting from the water substances, such as lime, potash, soda, and\r\na host of other substances necessary for the maintenance of\r\nhigh-grade organisms, depositing these materials in the growing\r\nstrata. Into these beds, which are buried as fast as they form, goes\r\nnot only these earthy materials, but a great store of the sea water as\r\nwell. The result would be in course of time a complete withdrawal into\r\nthe depths of the earth of those substances which play a necessary\r\npart in organic development. The earth would become more or less\r\ncompletely waterless on its surface, and the rocks exposed to view\r\nwould be composed mainly of silica, the material which to a great\r\nextent resists solution, and therefore avoids the dissolving which\r\novertakes most other kinds of rocks. Here comes in the machinery of\r\nthe hot springs, the dikes, and the volcanoes. These agents, operating\r\nunder the influence of the internal heat of the earth, are constantly\r\nengaged in bearing the earthy matter, particularly its precious more\r\nsolvent parts, back to the surface. The hot springs and volcanoes work\r\nswiftly and directly, and return the water, the carbon dioxide, and a\r\nhost of other vaporizable and soluble and fusible substances to the\r\nrealm of solar activity, to the living surface zone of the earth. The\r\ndikes operate less immediately, but in the end to the same effect.\r\nThey lift their materials miles above the level where they were\r\noriginally laid, probably from a zone which is rarely if ever exposed\r\nto view, placing them near the surface, where the erosive agents can\r\nreadily find access to them.\r\n\r\nOf the three agents which serve to export earth materials from its\r\ndepths, volcanoes are doubtless the most important. They send forth\r\nthe greater part of the water which is expelled from the rocks.\r\nVarious computations which the writer has made indicate that an\r\nordinary volcano, such as Ætna, in times of most intense explosion,\r\nmay send forth in the form of steam one fourth of a cubic mile or\r\nmore of water during each day of its discharge, and in a single great\r\neruption may pour forth several times this quantity. In its history\r\nÆtna has probably returned to the atmosphere some hundred cubic miles\r\nof water which but for the process would have remained permanently\r\nlocked up in its rock prison.\r\n\r\nThe ejection of rock material, though probably on the average less in\r\nquantity than the water which escapes, is also of noteworthy\r\nimportance. The volcanoes of Java and the adjacent isles have, during\r\nthe last hundred and twenty years, delivered to the seas more earth\r\nmaterial than has been carried into those basins by the great rivers.\r\nIf we could take account of all the volcanic ejections which have\r\noccurred in this time, we should doubtless find that the sum of the\r\nmaterials thus cast forth into the oceans was several times as great\r\nas that which was delivered from the lands by all the superficial\r\nagents which wear them away. Moreover, while the material from the\r\nland, except the small part which is in a state of complete solution,\r\nall falls close to the shore, the volcanic waste, because of its fine\r\ndivision or because of the blebs of air which its masses contain, may\r\nfloat for many years before it finds its way to the bottom, it may be\r\nat the antipodes of the point at which it came from the earth. While\r\nthus journeying through the sea the rock matter from the volcanoes is\r\napt to become dissolved in water; it is, indeed, doubtful if any\r\nconsiderable part of that which enters the ocean goes by gravitation\r\nto its floor. The greater portion probably enters the state of\r\nsolution and makes its way thence through the bodies of plants and\r\nanimals again into the ponderable state.\r\n\r\nIf an observer could view the earth from the surface of the moon, he\r\nwould probably each day behold one of these storms which the volcanoes\r\nsend forth. In the fortnight of darkness, even with the naked eye, it\r\nwould probably be possible to discern at any time several eruptions,\r\nsome of which would indicate that the earth's surface was ravaged by\r\ngreat catastrophes. The nearer view of these actions shows us that\r\nalthough locally and in small measure they are harmful to the life of\r\nthe earth, they are in a large way beneficent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                             THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequent mention which it has been necessary to make of soil\r\nphenomena in the preceding chapters shows how intimately this feature\r\nin the structure of the earth is blended with all the elements of its\r\nphysical history. It is now necessary for us to take up the phenomena\r\nof soils in a consecutive manner.\r\n\r\nThe study of any considerable river basin enables us to trace the more\r\nimportant steps which lead to the destructure and renovation of the\r\nearth's detrital coating. In such an interpretation we note that\r\neverywhere the rocks which were built on the sea bottom, and more or\r\nless made over in the great laboratory of the earth's interior, are at\r\nthe surface, when exposed to the conditions of the atmosphere, in\r\nprocess of being taken to pieces and returned to the sea. This action\r\ngoes on everywhere; every drop of rain helps it. It is aided by frost,\r\nor even by the changes of expansion and contraction which occur in the\r\nrocks from variations of heat. The result is that, except where the\r\nslopes are steep, the surface is quickly covered with a layer of\r\nfragments, all of which are in the process of decay, and ready to\r\nafford some food to plants. Even where the rock appears bare, it is\r\ngenerally covered with lichens, which, adhering to it, obtain a share\r\nof nutriment from the decayed material which they help to hold on the\r\nslope. When they have retained a thin sheet of the _débris_, mosses\r\nand small flowering plants help the work of retaining the detritus.\r\nSoon the strong-rooted bushes and trees win a foothold, and by sending\r\ntheir rootlets, which are at first small but rapidly enlarge, into the\r\ncrevices, they hasten the disruption of the stones.\r\n\r\nIf the construction of soil goes on upon a steep cliff, the quantity\r\nretained on the slope may be small, but at the base we find a talus,\r\ncomposed of the fragments not held by the vegetation, which gradually\r\nincreases as the cliff wears down, until the original precipice may be\r\nquite obliterated beneath a soil slope. At first this process is\r\nrapid; it becomes gradually slower and slower as the talus mounts up\r\nthe cliff and as the cliff loses its steepness, until finally a gentle\r\nslope takes the place of the steep.\r\n\r\nFrom the highest points in any river valley to the sea level the\r\nbroken-up rock, which we term soil, is in process of continuous\r\nmotion. Everywhere the rain water, flowing over the surface or soaking\r\nthrough the porous mass, is conveying portions of the material which\r\nis taken into solution in a speedy manner to the sea. Everywhere the\r\nexpansion of the soil in freezing, or the movements imposed on it by\r\nthe growth of roots, by the overturning of trees, or by the\r\ninnumerable borings and burrowings which animals make in the mass, is\r\nthrough the action of gravitation slowly working down the slope. Every\r\nlittle disturbance of the grains or fragments of the soil which lifts\r\nthem up causes them when they fall to descend a little way farther\r\ntoward the sea level. Working toward the streams, the materials of the\r\nsoil are in time delivered to those flowing waters, and by them urged\r\nspeedily, though in most cases interruptedly, toward the ocean.\r\n\r\nThere is another element in the movement of the soils which, though\r\nless appreciable, is still of great importance. The agents of decay\r\nwhich produce and remove the detritus, the chemical changes of the bed\r\nrock, and the mechanical action which roots apply to them, along with\r\nthe solutional processes, are constantly lowering the surface of the\r\nmass. In this way we can often prove that a soil continuously\r\nexisting has worked downward through many thousand feet of strata. In\r\nthis process of downgoing the country on which the layer rests may\r\nhave greatly changed its form, but the deposit, under favourable\r\nconditions, may continue to retain some trace of the materials which\r\nit derived from beds which have long since disappeared, their position\r\nhaving been far up in the spaces now occupied by the air. Where the\r\nslopes are steep and streams abound, we rarely find detritus which\r\nbelonged in rock more than a hundred feet above the present surface of\r\nthe soil. Where, however, as on those isolated table-lands or buttes\r\nwhich abound in certain portions of the Mississippi Valley, as well as\r\nin many other countries, we find a patch of soil lying on a nearly\r\nlevel surface, which for geologic ages has not felt the effect of\r\nstreams, we may discover, commingled in the _débris_, the harder\r\nwreckage derived from the decay of a thousand feet or more of vanished\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the effect of organic life on the processes which go\r\non in the soil, we first note the large fact that the development of\r\nall land vegetation depends upon the existence of this detritus--in a\r\nword, on the slow movement of the decaying rocky matter from the point\r\nwhere it is disrupted to its field of rest in the depths of the sea.\r\nThe plants take their food from the portion of this rocky waste which\r\nis brought into solution by the waters which penetrate the mass. On\r\nthe plants the animals feed, and so this vast assemblage of organisms\r\nis maintained. Not only does the land life maintain itself on the\r\nsoil, and give much to the sea, but it serves in various ways to\r\nprotect this detrital coating from too rapid destruction, and to\r\nimprove its quality. To see the nature of this work we should visit a\r\nregion where primeval forests still lie upon the slopes of a hilly\r\nregion. In the body of such a wood we find next the surface a coating\r\nof decayed vegetable matter, made up of the falling leaves, bark,\r\nbranches, and trunks which are constantly descending to the earth.\r\nOrdinarily, this layer is a foot or more in thickness; at the top it\r\nis almost altogether composed of vegetable matter; at the bottom it\r\nverges into the true soil. An important effect of this decayed\r\nvegetation is to restrain the movement of the surface water. Even in\r\nthe heaviest rains, provided the mass be not frozen, the water is\r\ntaken into it and delivered in the manner of springs to the larger\r\nstreams. We can better note the measure of this effect by observing\r\nthe difference in the ground covered by this primeval forest and that\r\nwhich we find near by which has been converted into tilled fields.\r\nWith the same degree of rapidity in the flow, the distinct stream\r\nchannels on the tilled ground are likely to be from twenty to a\r\nhundred times in length what they are on the forest bed. The result is\r\nthat while the brook which drains the forested area maintains a\r\ntolerably constant flow of clean water, the other from the tilled\r\nground courses only in times of heavy rain, and then is heavily\r\ncharged with mud. In the virgin conditions of the soil the downwear is\r\nvery slow; in its artificial state this wearing goes on so rapidly\r\nthat the sloping fields are likely to be worn to below the soil level\r\nin a few score years.\r\n\r\nNot only does the natural coating of vegetation, such as our forests\r\nimpose upon the country, protect the soil from washing away, but the\r\nroots of the larger plants are continually at work in various ways to\r\nincrease the fertility and depth of the stratum. In the form of\r\nslender fibrils these underground branches enter the joints and bed\r\nplanes of the rock, and there growing they disrupt the materials,\r\ngiving them a larger surface on which decay may operate. These bits,\r\nat first of considerable size, are in turn broken up by the same\r\naction. Where the underlying rocks afford nutritious materials, the\r\nbranches of our tap-rooted trees sometimes find their way ten feet or\r\nmore below the base of the true soil. Not only do they thus break up\r\nthe stones, but the nutrition which they obtain in the depths is\r\nbrought up and deposited in the parts above the ground, as well as in\r\nthe roots which lie in the true soil, so that when the tree dies it\r\nbecomes available for other plants. Thus in the forest condition of a\r\ncountry the amount of rock material contributed to the deposit in\r\ngeneral so far exceeds that which is taken away to the rivers by the\r\nunderground water as to insure the deepening of the soil bed to the\r\npoint where only the strongest roots--those belonging to our\r\ntap-rooted trees--can penetrate through it to the bed rocks.\r\n\r\nAlmost all forests are from time to time visited by winds which uproot\r\nthe trees. When they are thus rent from the earth, the underground\r\nbranches often form a disk containing a thick tangle of stones and\r\nearth, and having a diameter of ten or fifteen feet. The writer has\r\nfrequently observed a hundred cubic feet of soil matter, some of it\r\ntaken from the depth of a yard or more, thus uplifted into the air. In\r\nthe path of a hurricane or tornado we may sometimes find thousands of\r\nacres which have been subjected to this rude overturning--a natural\r\nploughing. As the roots rot away, the _débris_ which they held falls\r\noutside of the pit, thus forming a little hillock along the side of\r\nthe cavity. After a time the thrusting action of other roots and the\r\nslow motion of the soil down the slope restore the surface from its\r\nhillocky character to its original smoothness; but in many cases the\r\nnaturalist who has learned to discern with his feet may note these\r\nirregularities long after it has been recovered with the forest.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the effect of plants on the soil, that influence is almost\r\nequalled by the action of the animals which have the habit of entering\r\nthe earth, finding there a temporary abiding place. The number of\r\nthese ground forms is surprisingly great. It includes, indeed, a host\r\nof creatures which are efficient agents in enriching the earth. The\r\nspecies of earthworms, some of which occupy forested districts as well\r\nas the fields, have the habit of passing the soil material through\r\ntheir bodies, extracting from the mass such nutriment as it may\r\ncontain. In this manner the particles of mineral matter become\r\npulverized, and in a measure affected by chemical changes in the\r\nbodies of the creatures, and are thus better fitted to afford plant\r\nfood. Sometimes the amount of the earth which the creatures take in in\r\nmoving through their burrows and void upon the surface is sufficient\r\nto form annually a layer on the surface of the ground having a depth\r\nof one twentieth of an inch or more. It thus may well happen that the\r\nsoil to the depth of two or three feet is completely overturned in the\r\ncourse of a few hundred years. As the particles which the creatures\r\ndevour are rather small, the tendency is to accumulate the finer\r\nportions of the soil near the surface of the earth, where by solution\r\nthey may contribute to the needs of the lowly plants. It is probably\r\ndue to the action of these creatures that small relics of ancient men,\r\nsuch as stone tools, are commonly found buried at a considerable depth\r\nbeneath the earth, and rarely appear upon the surface except where it\r\nhas been subjected to deep ploughing or to the action of running\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nAlong with the earthworms, the ants labour to overturn the soil;\r\nfrequently they are the more effective of the two agents. The common\r\nspecies, though they make no permanent hillocks, have been observed by\r\nthe writer to lay upon the surface each year as much as a quarter of\r\nan inch of sand and other fine materials which they have brought up\r\nfrom a considerable depth. In many regions, particularly in those\r\noccupied by glacial drift, and pebbly alluvium along the rivers, the\r\neffect of this action, like that of earthworms, is to bring to the\r\nsurface the finer materials, leaving the coarser pebbles in the\r\ndepths. In this way they have changed the superficial character of the\r\nsoil over great areas; we may say, indeed, over a large part of the\r\nearth, and this in a way which fits it better to serve the needs of\r\nthe wild plants as well as the uses of the farmer.\r\n\r\nMany thousand species of insects, particularly the larger beetles,\r\nhave the habit of passing their larval state in the under earth. Here\r\nthey generally excavate burrows, and thus in a way delve the soil. As\r\nmany of them die before reaching maturity, their store of organic\r\nmatter is contributed to the mass, and serves to nourish the plants.\r\nIf the student will carefully examine a section of the earth either in\r\nits natural or in its tilled state, he will be surprised to find how\r\nnumerous the grubs are. They may often be found to the number of a\r\nscore or more of each cubic foot of material. Many of the species\r\nwhich develop underground come from eggs which have carefully been\r\nencased in organic matter before their deposition in the earth. Thus\r\nsome of the carrion beetles are in the habit of laying their eggs in\r\nthe bodies of dead birds or field mice, which they then bury to the\r\ndepth of some inches in the earth. In this way nearly all the small\r\nbirds and mammals of our woods disappear from view in a few hours\r\nafter they are dead. Other species make balls from the dung of cattle\r\nin which they lay their eggs, afterward rolling the little spheres, it\r\nmay be for hundreds of feet, to the chambers in the soil which they\r\nhave previously prepared. In this way a great deal of animal matter is\r\nintroduced into the earth, and contributes to its fertility.\r\n\r\nMany of our small mammals have the habit of making their dwelling\r\nplaces in the soil. Some of them, such as the moles, normally abide in\r\nthe subterranean realm for all their lives. Others use the excavations\r\nas places of retreat. In any case, these excavations serve to move the\r\nparticles of the soil about, and the materials which the animals drag\r\ninto the earth, as well as the excrement of the creatures, act to\r\nenrich it. This habit of taking food underground is not limited to the\r\nmammals; it is common with the ants, and even the earthworms, as noted\r\nby Charles Darwin in his wonderful essay on these creatures, are\r\naccustomed to drag into their burrows bits of grass and the slender\r\nleaves of pines. It is not known what purpose they attain by these\r\nactions, but it is sufficiently common somewhat to affect the\r\nconditions of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe result of these complicated works done by animals and plants on\r\nthe soil is that the material to a considerable depth are constantly\r\nbeing supplied with organic matter, which, along with the mineral\r\nmaterial, constitutes that part of the earth which can support\r\nvegetation. Experiment will readily show that neither crushed rock nor\r\npure vegetable mould will of itself serve to maintain any but the\r\nlowliest vegetation. It requires that the two materials be mixed in\r\norder that the earth may yield food for ordinary plants, particularly\r\nfor those which are of use to man, as crops. On this account all the\r\nprocesses above noted whereby the waste of plant and animal life is\r\ncarried below the surface are of the utmost importance in the creation\r\nand preservation of the soil. It has been found, indeed, in almost all\r\ncases, necessary for the farmer to maintain the fertility of his\r\nfields to plough-in quantities of such organic waste. By so doing he\r\nimitates the work which is effected in virgin soil by natural action.\r\nAs the process is costly in time and material, it is often neglected\r\nor imperfectly done, with the result that the fields rapidly diminish\r\nin fertility.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the buried organic matter acts upon the soil is not\r\nyet thoroughly understood. In part it accomplishes the results by the\r\nmaterials which on its decay it contributes to the soil in a state in\r\nwhich they may readily be dissolved and taken up by the roots into\r\ntheir sap; in part, however, it is believed that they better the\r\nconditions by affording dwelling places for a host of lowly species,\r\nsuch as the forms which are known as bacteria. The organisms probably\r\naid in the decomposition of the mineral matter, and in the conversion\r\nof nitrogen, which abounds in the air or the soil, into nitrates of\r\npotash and soda--substances which have a very great value as\r\nfertilizers. Some effect is produced by the decay of the foreign\r\nmatter brought into the soil, which as it passes away leaves channels\r\nthrough which the soil water can more readily pass.\r\n\r\nBy far the most general and important effect arising from the decay\r\nof organic matter in the earth is to be found in the carbon dioxide\r\nwhich is formed as the oxygen of the air combines with the carbon\r\nwhich all organic material contains. As before noted, water thus\r\ncharged has its capacity for taking other substances into solution\r\nvastly increased, and on this solvent action depends in large part the\r\ndecay of the bed rocks and the solution of materials which are to be\r\nappropriated by the plants.\r\n\r\nHaving now sketched the general conditions which lead to the formation\r\nof soils, we must take account of certain important variations in\r\ntheir conditions due to differences in the ways in which they are\r\nformed and preserved. These matters are not only of interest to the\r\ngeologist, but are of the utmost importance to the life of mankind, as\r\nwell as all the lower creatures which dwell upon the lands. First, we\r\nshould note that soils are divisible into three great groups, which,\r\nthough not sharply parted from each other, are sufficiently peculiar\r\nfor the purposes of classification. Where the earth material has been\r\nderived from the rocks which nearly or immediately underlie it, we\r\nhave a group of soils which may be entitled those of immediate\r\nderivation--that is, derived from rocks near by, or from beds which\r\nonce overlaid the level and have since been decayed away. Next, we\r\nhave alluvial soils, those composed of materials which have been\r\ntransported by streams, commonly from a great distance, and laid down\r\non their flood plains. Third, the soils the mineral matters of which\r\nhave been brought into their position by the action of glaciers; these\r\nin a way resemble those formed by rivers, but the materials are\r\ngenerally imperfectly sorted, coarse and fine being mingled together.\r\nLast of all, we have the soils due to the accumulation of blown dust\r\nor blown sand, which, unlike the others, occupy but a small part of\r\nthe land surface. It would be possible, indeed, to make yet another\r\ndivision, including those areas which when emerging from the sea were\r\ncovered with fine, uncemented detritus ready at once to serve the\r\npurposes of a soil. Only here and there, and but seldom, do we find\r\nsoils of this nature.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of soils belonging to the group to which we have\r\ngiven the title of immediate derivation that they have accumulated\r\nslowly, that they move very gradually down the slopes on which they\r\nlie, and that in all cases they represent, with a part of their mass\r\nat least, levels of rock which have disappeared from the region which\r\nthey occupied. The additions made to their mass are from below, and\r\nthat mass is constantly shrinking, generally at a pretty rapid rate,\r\nby the mineral matter which is dissolved and goes away with the spring\r\nwater. They also are characteristically thin on steep slopes,\r\nthickening toward the base of the incline, where the diminished grade\r\npermits the soil to move slowly, and therefore to accumulate.\r\n\r\nIn alluvial soils we find accumulations which are characterized by\r\ngrowth on their upper surfaces, and by the distant transportation of\r\nthe materials of which they are composed. In these deposits the\r\noutleaching removes vast amounts of the materials, but so long as the\r\nfloods from time to time visit their surfaces the growth of the\r\ndeposits is continued. This growth rarely takes place from the waste\r\nof the bed rocks on which the alluvium lies. It is characteristic of\r\nalluvial soils that they are generally made up of _débris_ derived\r\nfrom fields where the materials have undergone the change which we\r\nhave noted in the last paragraph; therefore these latter deposits have\r\nthroughout the character which renders the mineral materials easily\r\ndissolved. Moreover, the mass as it is constructed is commonly mingled\r\nwith a great deal of organic waste, which serves to promote its\r\nfertility. On these accounts alluvial grounds, though they vary\r\nconsiderably in fertility, commonly afford the most fruitful fields of\r\nany region. They have, moreover, the signal advantage that they often\r\nmay be refreshed by allowing the flood waters to visit them, an\r\naction which but for the interference of man commonly takes place once\r\neach year. Thus in the valley of the Nile there are fields which have\r\nbeen giving rich grain harvests probably for more than four thousand\r\nyears, without any other effective fertilizing than that derived from\r\nthe mud of the great river.\r\n\r\nThe group of glaciated soils differs in many ways from either of those\r\nmentioned. In it we find the mineral matter to have been broken up,\r\ntransported, and accumulated without the influence of those conditions\r\nwhich ordinarily serve to mix rock _débris_ with organic matter during\r\nthe process by which it is broken into bits. When vegetation came to\r\npreoccupy the fields made desolate by glacial action, it found in most\r\nplaces more than sufficient material to form soils, but the greater\r\npart of the matter was in the condition of pebbles of very hard rock\r\nand sand grains, fragments of silex. Fortunately, the broken-up state\r\nof this material, by exposing a great surface of the rocky matter to\r\ndecay, has enabled the plants to convert a portion of the mass into\r\nearth fit for the uses of their roots. But as the time which has\r\nelapsed since the disappearance of the glaciers is much less than that\r\noccupied in the formation of ordinary soil, this decay has in most\r\ncases not yet gone very far, so that in a cubic foot of glaciated\r\nwaste the amount of material available for plants is often only a\r\nfraction of that held in the soils of immediate derivation.\r\n\r\nIn the greater portion of the fields occupied by glacial waste the\r\nprocesses which lead to the introduction of organic matter into the\r\nearth have not gone far enough to set in effective work the great\r\nlaboratory which has to operate in order to give fertile soil. The\r\npebbles hinder the penetration of the roots as well as the movement of\r\ninsects and other animals. There has not been time enough for the\r\noverturning of trees to bring about a certain admixture of vegetable\r\nmatter with the soil--in a word, the process of soil-making, though\r\nthe first condition, that of broken-up rock, has been accomplished,\r\nis as yet very incomplete. It needs, indeed, care in the introduction\r\nof organic matter for its completion.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of glacial soils that they are indefinitely deep.\r\nThis often is a disadvantageous feature, for the reason that the soil\r\nwater may pass so far down into the earth that the roots are often\r\ndeprived of the moisture which they need, and which in ordinary soils\r\nis retained near the surface by the hard underlayer. On the other\r\nhand, where the glacial waste is made up of pebbles formed from rocks\r\nof varied chemical composition, which contain a considerable share of\r\nlime, potash, soda, and other substances which are required by plants,\r\nthe very large surface which they expose to decay provides the soil\r\nwith a continuous enrichment. In a cubic foot of pebbly glacial earth\r\nwe often find that the mass offers several hundred times as much\r\nsurface to the action of decay as is afforded by the underlying solid\r\nbed rock from which a soil of immediate derivation has to win its\r\nmineral supply. Where the pebbly glacial waste is provided with a\r\nmixture of vegetable matter, the process of decay commonly goes\r\nforward with considerable rapidity. If the supply of such matter is\r\nlarge, such as may be produced by ploughing in barnyard manure or\r\ngreen crops, the nutritive value of the earth may be brought to a very\r\nhigh point.\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar experience in regions where glacial soils exist that\r\nthe earth beneath the swamps when drained is found to be\r\nextraordinarily well suited for farming purposes. On inspecting the\r\npebbles from such places, we observe that they are remarkably decayed.\r\nWhere the masses contain large quantities of feldspar, as is the case\r\nin the greater part of our granitic and other crystalline rocks, this\r\nmaterial in its decomposition is converted into kaolin or feldspar\r\nclay, and gives the stones a peculiar white appearance, which marks\r\nthe decomposition, and indicates the process by which a great variety\r\nof valuable soil ingredients are brought into a state where they may\r\nbe available for plants.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the glacial areas, particularly in the region near\r\nthe margin of the ice sheet, where the glacier remained in one\r\nposition for a considerable time, we find extensive deposits of\r\nsilicious sand, formed of the materials which settled from the\r\nunder-ice stream, near where they escaped from the glacial cavern.\r\nThese kames and sand plains, because of the silicious nature of their\r\nmaterials and the very porous nature of the soil which they afford,\r\nare commonly sterile, or at most render a profit to the tiller by dint\r\nof exceeding care. Thus in Massachusetts, although the first settlers\r\nseized upon these grounds, and planted their villages upon them\r\nbecause the forests there were scanty and the ground free from\r\nencumbering boulders, were soon driven to betake themselves to those\r\nareas where the drift was less silicious, and where the pebbles\r\nafforded a share of clay. Very extensive fields of this sandy nature\r\nin southeastern New England have never been brought under tillage.\r\nThus on the island of Martha's Vineyard there is a connected area\r\ncontaining about thirty thousand acres which lies in a very favourable\r\nposition for tillage, but has been found substantially worthless for\r\nsuch use. The farmers have found it more advantageous to clear away\r\nthe boulders from the coarser drift in order to win soil which would\r\ngive them fair returns.\r\n\r\nThose areas which are occupied by soil materials which have been\r\nbrought into their position by the action of the wind may, as regards\r\ntheir character, be divided into two very distinct groups--the dunes\r\nand loess deposits. In the former group, where, as we have noted (see\r\npage 123), the coarse sea sands or those from the shores of lakes are\r\ndriven forward as a marching hillock, the grains of the material are\r\nalmost always silicious. The fragments in the motion are not taken up\r\ninto the air, but are blown along the surface. Such dune accumulations\r\nafford an earth which is even more sterile than that of the glacial\r\nsand plains, where there is generally a certain admixture of pebbles\r\nfrom rocks which by their decomposition may afford some elements of\r\nfertility. Fortunately for the interests of man, these wind-borne\r\nsands occupy but a small area; in North America, in the aggregate,\r\nthere probably are not more than one thousand square miles of such\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nWhere the rock material drifted by the winds is so fine that it may\r\nrise into the air in the form of dust, the accumulations made of it\r\ngenerally afford a fertile soil, and this for the reason that they are\r\ncomposed of various kinds of rock, and not, as in the case of dunes,\r\nof nearly pure silica. In some very rare cases, where the seashore is\r\nbordered by coral reefs, as it is in parts of southern Florida, and\r\nthe strand is made up of limestone bits derived from the hard parts\r\nwhich the polyps secrete, small dunes are made of limy material.\r\nOwing, however, in part to the relatively heavy nature of this\r\nsubstance, as well as to the rapid manner in which its grains become\r\ncemented together, such limestone dunes never attain great size nor\r\ntravel any distance from their point of origin.\r\n\r\nAs before noted, dust accumulations form the soil in extended areas\r\nwhich lie to the leeward of great deserts. Thus a considerable part of\r\nwestern China and much of the United States to the west of the\r\nMississippi is covered by these wind-blown earths. Wherever the\r\nrainfall is considerable these loess deposits have proved to have a\r\nhigh agricultural value.\r\n\r\nWhere a region has an earth which has recently passed from beneath the\r\nsea or a great lake, the surface is commonly covered by incoherent\r\ndetritus which has escaped consolidation into hard rock by the fact\r\nthat it has not been buried and thus brought into the laboratory of\r\nthe earth's crust. When such a region becomes dry land, the materials\r\nare immediately ready to enter into the state of soil. They commonly\r\ncontain a good deal of waste derived from the organic life which\r\ndwelt upon the sea bottom and was embedded in the strata as they were\r\nformed. Where these accumulations are made in a lake, the land\r\nvegetation at once possesses the field, even a single year being\r\nsufficient for it to effect its establishment. Where the lands emerge\r\nfrom the sea, it requires a few years for the salt water to drain away\r\nso that the earth can be fit for the uses of plants. In a general way\r\nthese sea-bottom soils resemble those formed in the alluvial plains.\r\nThey are, however, commonly more sandy, and their substances less\r\npenetrated by that decay which goes on very freely in the atmosphere\r\nbecause of the abundant supply of oxygen, and but slowly on the sea\r\nfloor. Moreover, the marine deposits are generally made up in large\r\npart of silicious sand, a material which is produced in large\r\nquantities by the disruption of the rocks along the sea coast. The\r\nlargest single field of these ocean-bottom soils of North America is\r\nfound in the lowland region of the southern United States, a wide belt\r\nof country extending along the coast from the Rio Grande to New York.\r\nAlthough the streams have channelled shallow valleys in the beds of\r\nthis region, the larger part of its surface still has the peculiar\r\nfeatures of form and composition which were impressed upon it when it\r\nlay below the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nLocal variations in the character of the soil covering are exceedingly\r\nnumerous, and these differences of condition profoundly affect the\r\nestate of man. We shall therefore consider some of the more important\r\nof these conditions, with special reference to their origin.\r\n\r\nThe most important and distinctly marked variation in the fertility of\r\nsoils is that which is produced by differences in the rainfall. No\r\nparts of the earth are entirely lacking in rain, but over considerable\r\nareas the precipitation does not exceed half a foot a year. In such\r\nrealms the soil is sterile, and the natural coating of vegetation\r\nlimited to those plants which can subsist on dew or which can take on\r\nan occasional growth at such times as moisture may come upon them.\r\nWith a slight increase in precipitation, the soil rapidly increases in\r\nproductivity, so that we may say that where as much as about ten\r\ninches of water enters the earth during the summer half of the year,\r\nit becomes in a considerable measure fit for agriculture. Observations\r\nindicate that the conditions of fertility are not satisfied where the\r\nrainfall is just sufficient to fill the pores of the soil; there must\r\nbe enough water entering the earth to bring about a certain amount of\r\noutflow in the form of springs. The reason of this need becomes\r\napparent when we study the evident features of those soils which,\r\nthough from season to season charged with water, do not yield springs,\r\nbut send the moisture away through the atmosphere. Wherever these\r\nconditions occur we observe that the soil in dry seasons becomes\r\ncoated with a deposit of mineral matter, which, because of its taste,\r\nhas received the name of alkali. The origin of this coating is as\r\nfollows: The pores of the soil, charged from year to year with\r\nsufficient water to fill them, become stored with a fluid which\r\ncontains a very large amount of dissolved mineral matter--too much,\r\nindeed, to permit the roots of plants, save a few species which have\r\nbecome accustomed to the conditions, to do their appointed work. In\r\nfact, this water is much like that of the sea, which the roots of only\r\na few of our higher plants can tolerate. When the dry season comes on,\r\nthe heat of the sun evaporates the water at the surface, leaving\r\nbehind a coating composed of the substances which the water contains.\r\nThe soil below acts in the manner of a lamp-wick to draw up fluid as\r\nrapidly as the heat burns it away. When the soil water is as far as\r\npossible exhausted, the alkali coating may represent a considerable\r\npart of the soluble matter of the soil, and in the next rainy season\r\nit may return in whole or in part to the under-earth, again to be\r\ndrawn in the manner before described to the upper level. It is\r\ntherefore only when a considerable share of the ground water goes\r\nforth to the streams in each year that the alkaline materials are in\r\nquantity kept down to the point where the roots of our crop-giving\r\nplants can make due use of the soil. Where, in an arid region, the\r\nground can be watered from the enduring streams or from artificial\r\nreservoirs, the main advantage arising from the process is commonly\r\nfound in the control which it gives the farmer in the amount of the\r\nsoil water. He can add to the rainfall sufficient to take away the\r\nexcess of mineral matter. When such soils are first brought under\r\ntillage it is necessary to use a large amount of water from the\r\ncanals, in order to wash away the old store of alkali. After that a\r\ncomparatively small contribution will often keep the soil in excellent\r\ncondition for agriculture. It has been found, however, in the\r\nirrigated lands beside the Nile that where too much saving is\r\npractised in the irrigation, the alkaline coating will appear where it\r\nhas been unknown before, and with it an unfitness of the earth to bear\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nAlthough the crust of mineral matters formed in the manner above\r\ndescribed is characteristic of arid countries, and in general peculiar\r\nto them, a similar deposit may under peculiar conditions be formed in\r\nregions of great rainfall. Thus on the eastern coast of New England,\r\nwhere the tidal marshes have here and there been diked from the sea\r\nand brought under tillage, the dissolved mineral matters of the soil,\r\nwhich are excessive in quantity, are drawn to the surface, forming a\r\ncoating essentially like that which is so common in arid regions. The\r\nwriter has observed this crust on such diked lands, having a thickness\r\nof an eighth of an inch. In fact, this alkali coating represents\r\nmerely the extreme operation of a process which is going on in all\r\nsoils, and which contributes much to their fertility. When rain falls\r\nand passes downward into the earth, it conveys the soluble matter to a\r\ndepth below the surface, often to beyond the point where our ordinary\r\ncrop plants, such as the small grains, can have access to it, and\r\nthis for the reason that their roots do not penetrate deeply. When dry\r\nweather comes and evaporation takes place from the surface, the fluid\r\nis drawn up to the upper soil layer, and there, in process of\r\nevaporation, deposits the dissolved materials which it contains. Thus\r\nthe mineral matter which is fit for plant food is constantly set in\r\nmotion, and in its movement passes the rootlets of the plants. It is\r\nprobably on this account--at least in part--that very wet weather is\r\nalmost as unfavourable to the farmer as exceedingly dry, the normal\r\nalternation in the conditions being, as is well known, best suited to\r\nhis needs.\r\n\r\nSo long as the earth is subjected to conditions in which the rainfall\r\nmay bring about a variable amount of water in the superficial detrital\r\nlayer, we find normal fruitful soils, though in their more arid\r\nconditions they may be fit for but few species of plants. When, by\r\nincreasing aridity, we pass to conditions where there is no tolerably\r\npermanent store of water in the _débris_, the material ceases to have\r\nthe qualities of a soil, and becomes mere rock waste. At the other\r\nextreme of the scale we pass to conditions where the water is\r\nsteadfastly maintained in the interstices of the detritus, and there\r\nagain the characteristic of the soil and its fitness for the uses of\r\nland vegetation likewise disappear. In a word, true soil conditions\r\ndemand the presence of moisture, but that in insufficient quantities,\r\nto keep the pores of the earth continually filled; where they are thus\r\nfilled, we have the condition of swamps. Between these extremes the\r\nlevel at which the water stands in the soil in average seasons is\r\ncontinually varying. In rainy weather it may rise quite to the\r\nsurface; in a dry season it may sink far down. As this water rises and\r\nfalls, it not only moves, as before noted, the soluble mineral\r\nmaterials, but it draws the air into and expels it from the earth with\r\neach movement. This atmospheric circulation of the soil, as has been\r\nproved by experiment, is of great importance in maintaining its\r\nfertility; the successive charges of air supply the needs of the\r\nmicroscopic underground creatures which play a large part in enriching\r\nthe soil, and the direct effect of the oxygen in promoting decay is\r\nlikewise considerable. A part of the work which is accomplished by\r\noverturning the earth in tillage consists in this introduction of the\r\nair into the pores of the soil, where it serves to advance the actions\r\nwhich bring mineral matters into solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mountain gorge, Himalayas, India. Note the difference\r\nin the slope of the eroded rocks and the effect of erosion upon them;\r\nalso the talus slopes at the base of the cliffs which the torrent is\r\ncutting away. On the left of the foreground there is a little bench\r\nshowing a recent higher line of the water._]\r\n\r\nIn the original conditions of any country which is the seat of\r\nconsiderable rainfall, and where the river system is not so far\r\ndeveloped as to provide channels for the ready exit of the waters, we\r\ncommonly find very extensive swamps; these conditions of bad drainage\r\nalmost invariably exist where a region has recently been elevated\r\nabove the level of the sea, and still retains the form of an irregular\r\nrolling plain common to sea floors, and also in regions where the work\r\ndone by glaciers has confused the drainage which the antecedent\r\nstreams may have developed. In an old, well-elaborated river system\r\nswamps are commonly absent, or, if they occur, are due to local\r\naccidents of an unimportant nature.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose swamps may be divided into three groups--climbing\r\nbogs, lake bogs, and marine marshes. The first two of these groups\r\ndepend on the movements of the rain water over the land; the third on\r\nthe action of the tides. Beginning our account with the first and most\r\nexceptional of these groups, we note the following features in their\r\ninteresting history:\r\n\r\nWherever in a humid region, on a gentle slope--say with an inclination\r\nnot exceeding ten feet to the mile--the soil is possessed by any\r\nspecies of plants whose stems grow closely together, so that from\r\ntheir decayed parts a spongelike mass is produced, we have the\r\nconditions which favour the development of climbing bogs. Beginning\r\nusually in the shores of a pool, these plants, necessarily of a\r\nwater-loving species, retain so much moisture in the spongy mass\r\nwhich they form that they gradually extend up the slope. Thus\r\nextending the margin of their field, and at the same time thickening\r\nthe deposit which they form, these plants may build a climbing bog\r\nover the surface until steeps are attained where the inclination is so\r\ngreat that the necessary amount of water can not be held in the spongy\r\nmass, or where, even if so held, the whole coating will in time slip\r\ndown in the manner of an avalanche.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the climbing bogs of the world are limited to the\r\nmoist and cool regions of high latitudes, where species of moss\r\nbelonging to the genus _Sphagnum_ plentifully flourish. These plants\r\ncan only grow where they are continuously supplied with a bath of\r\nwater about their roots. They develop in lake bogs as far south as\r\nMexico, but in the climbing form they are hardly traceable south of\r\nNew England, and are nowhere extensively developed within the limits\r\nof the United States. In more northern parts of this continent, and in\r\nnorthwestern Europe, particularly in the moist climate of Ireland,\r\nclimbing bogs occupy great areas, and hold up their lakes of\r\ninterstitially contained water over the slopes of hills, where the\r\nsurface rises at the rate of thirty feet or more to the mile. So long\r\nas the deposit of decayed vegetable matter which has accumulated in\r\nthis manner is thin, therefore everywhere penetrated by the fibrous\r\nroots of the moss, it may continue to cling to its sloping bed; but\r\nwhen it attains a considerable thickness, and the roots in the lower\r\npart decay, the pulpy mass, water-laden in some time of heavy rain,\r\nbreak away in a vast torrent of thick, black mud, which may inundate\r\nthe lower lands, causing widespread destruction.\r\n\r\nIn more southern countries, other water-loving plants lead to the\r\nformation of climbing bogs. Of these, the commonest and most effective\r\nare the species of reeds, of which our Indian cane is a familiar\r\nexample. Brakes of this vegetation, plentifully mingled with other\r\nspecies of aquatic growth, form those remarkable climbing bogs known\r\nas the Dismal and other swamps, which numerously occur along the coast\r\nline of the United States from southern Maryland to eastern Texas.\r\nClimbing bogs are particularly interesting, not only from the fact\r\nthat they are eminently peculiar effects of plant growth, but because\r\nthey give us a vivid picture of those ancient morasses in which grew\r\nthe plants that formed the beds of vegetable matter now appearing in\r\nthe state of coal. Each such bed of buried swamp material was, with\r\nrare exceptions, where the accumulation took place in lakes, gathered\r\nin climbing bogs such as we have described.\r\n\r\nLake bogs occur in all parts of the world, but in their best\r\ndevelopment are limited to relatively high latitudes, and this for the\r\nreason that the plants which form vegetable matter grow most\r\nluxuriantly in cool climates and in regions where the level of the\r\nbasin is subject to less variation than occurs in the alternating wet\r\nand dry seasons which exist in nearly all tropical regions. The\r\nfittest conditions are found in glaciated regions, where, as before\r\nnoted, small lakes are usually very abundant. On the shores of one of\r\nthese pools, of size not so great that the waves may attain a\r\nconsiderable height, or in the sheltered bay of a larger lake, various\r\naquatic plants, especially the species of pond lilies, take root upon\r\nthe bottom, and spread their expanded leaves on the surface of the\r\nwater. These flexible-leaved and elastic-stemmed plants can endure\r\nwaves which attain no more than a foot or two of height, and by the\r\nfriction which they afford make the swash on the shore very slight. In\r\nthe quiet water, rushes take root, and still further protect the\r\nstrand, so that the very delicate vegetation of the mosses, such as\r\nthe _Sphagnum_, can fix itself on the shore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Sphagnum_ mat has begun its growth, the strength given\r\nby its interlaced fibres enables it to extend off from the shore and\r\nfloat upon the water. In this way it may rapidly enlarge, if not\r\nbroken up by the waves, so that its front advances into the lake at\r\nthe rate of several inches each year. While growing outwardly it\r\nthickens, so that the bottom of the mass gradually works down toward\r\nthe floor of the basin. At the same time the lower part of the sheet,\r\ndecaying, contributes a shower of soft peat mud to the floor of the\r\nlake. In this way, growing at its edge, deepening, and contributing to\r\nan upgrowth from the bottom, a few centuries may serve entirely to\r\nfill a deep basin with peaty accumulation. In general, however, the\r\nsurface of the bog closes over the lake before the accumulation has\r\ncompletely filled the shoreward portions of the area. In these\r\nconditions we have what is familiarly known as a quaking bog, which\r\ncan be swayed up and down by a person who quickly stoops and rises\r\nwhile standing on the surface. In this state the tough and thick sheet\r\nof growing plants is sufficient to uphold a considerable weight, but\r\nso elastic that the underlying water can be thrown into waves. Long\r\nbefore the bog has completely filled the lake with the peaty\r\naccumulations the growth of trees is apt to take place on its surface,\r\nwhich often reduces the area to the appearance of a very level wet\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Diagram showing beginning of peat bog: A,\r\nlake; B, lilies and rushes; C, lake bog; D, climbing bog.]\r\n\r\nClimbing and lake bogs in the United States occupy a total area of\r\nmore than fifty thousand square miles. In all North America the total\r\narea is probably more than twice as great. Similar deposits are\r\nexceedingly common in the Eurasian continent and in southern\r\nPatagonia. It is probable that the total amount of these fields in\r\ndifferent parts of the world exceeds half a million square miles.\r\nThese two groups of fresh-water swamps have an interest, for the\r\nreason that when reduced to cultivation by drainage and by subsequent\r\nremoval of the excess of peaty matter, by burning or by natural decay,\r\nafford very rich soil. The fairest fields of northern Europe,\r\nparticularly in Great Britain and Ireland, have been thus won to\r\ntillage. In the first centuries of our era a large part of\r\nEngland--perhaps as much as one tenth of the ground now tilled in that\r\ncountry--was occupied by these lands, which retained water in such\r\nmeasure as to make them unfit for tillage, the greater portion of this\r\narea being in the condition of thin climbing bog. For many centuries\r\nmuch of the energy of the people was devoted to the reclamation of\r\nthese valuable lands. This task of winning the swamp lands to\r\nagriculture has been more completely accomplished in England than\r\nelsewhere, but it has gone far on the continent of Europe,\r\nparticularly in Germany. In the United States, owing to the fact that\r\nlands have been cheap, little of this work of swamp-draining has as\r\nyet been accomplished. It is likely that the next great field of\r\nimprovement to be cultivated by the enterprising people will be found\r\nin these excessively humid lands, from which the food-giving resources\r\nfor the support of many million people can be won.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Diagram showing development of swamp: A,\r\nremains of lake; B, surface growth; c, peat.]\r\n\r\nThe group of marine marshes differs in many important regards from\r\nthose which are formed in fresh water. Where the tide visits any\r\ncoast line, and in sheltered positions along that shore, a number of\r\nplants, mostly belonging to the group of grasses, species which have\r\nbecome accustomed to having their roots bathed by salt water, begin\r\nthe formation of a spongy mat, which resembles that composed of\r\n_Sphagnum_, only it is much more solid. This mat of the marine marshes\r\nsoon attains a thickness of a foot or more, the upper or growing\r\nsurface lying in a position where it is covered for two or three hours\r\nat each visit of the tide. Growing rapidly outward from the shore, and\r\nhaving a strength which enables it to resist in a tolerably effective\r\nmanner waves not more than two or three feet high, this accumulation\r\nmakes head against the sea. To a certain extent the waves undermine\r\nthe front of the sheet and break up masses of it, which they\r\ndistribute over the shallow bottom below the level at which these\r\nplants can grow. In this deeper water, also, other marine animals and\r\nplants are continually developing, and their remains are added to the\r\naccumulations which are ever shallowing the water, thus permitting a\r\nfurther extension of the level, higher-lying marsh. This process\r\ncontinues until the growth has gone as far as the scouring action of\r\nthe tidal currents will permit. In the end the bay, originally of\r\nwide-open water, is only such at high tide. For the greater part of\r\nthe time it appears as broad savannas, whose brilliant green gives\r\nthem the aspect of rare fertility.\r\n\r\nOwing to the conditions of their growth, the deposits formed in marine\r\nmarshes contain no distinct peat, the nearest approach to that\r\nsubstance being the tangle of wirelike roots which covers the upper\r\nfoot or so of the accumulation. The greater part of the mass is\r\ncomposed of fine silt, brought in by the streams of land water which\r\ndischarge into the basin, and by the remains of animals which dwelt\r\nupon the bottom or between the stalks of the plants that occupy the\r\nsurface of the marshes. These interspaces afford admirable shelter to\r\na host of small marine forms. The result is, that the tidal marshes,\r\nas well as the lower-lying mud flats, which have been occupied by the\r\nmat of vegetation, afford admirable earth for tillage. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, there are two disadvantages connected with the redemption of\r\nsuch lands. In the first place, it is necessary to exclude the sea\r\nfrom the area, which can only be accomplished by considerable\r\nengineering work; in the second place, the exclusion of the tide\r\ninevitably results in the silting up of the passage by which the water\r\nfound its way to the sea. As these openings are often used for\r\nharbours, the effect arising from their destruction is often rather\r\nserious. Nevertheless, in some parts of the world very extensive and\r\nmost fertile tracts of land have thus been won from the sea; a large\r\npart of Holland and shore-land districts in northern Europe are made\r\nup of fields which were originally covered by the tide. Near the mouth\r\nof the Rhine, indeed, the people have found these sea-bottom soils so\r\nprofitable that they have gone beyond the zone of the marshes, and\r\nhave drained considerable seas which of old were permanently covered,\r\neven at the lowest level of the waters.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of North America marine marshes have an extensive\r\ndevelopment, and vary much in character. In the Bay of Fundy, where\r\nthe tides have an altitude of fifty feet or more, the energy of their\r\ncurrents is such that the marsh mat rarely forms. Its place, however,\r\nis taken by vast and ever-changing mud flats, the materials of which\r\nare swept to and fro by the moving waters. The people of this region\r\nhave learned an art of a peculiar nature, by which they win broad\r\nfields of excellent land from the sea. Selecting an area of the flats,\r\nthe surface of which has been brought to within a few feet of high\r\ntide, they inclose it with a stout barrier or dike, which has openings\r\nfor the free admission of the tidal waters. Entering this basin, the\r\ntide, moving with considerable velocity, bears in quantities of\r\nsediment. In the basin, the motion being arrested, this sediment\r\nfalls to the bottom, and serves to raise its level. In a few months\r\nthe sheet of sediment is brought near the plane of the tidal movement,\r\nthen the gates are closed at times when the tide has attained half of\r\nits height, so that the ground within the dike is not visited by the\r\nsea water, and can be cultivated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Map of Ipswich marshes, Massachusetts, formed\r\nbehind a barrier beach.]\r\n\r\nAlong the coast of New England the ordinary marine marshes attain an\r\nextensive development in the form of broad-grassed savannas. With this\r\naspect, though with a considerable change in the plants which they\r\nbear, the fringe of savannas continues southward along the coast to\r\nnorthern Florida. In the region about the mouth of the Savannah River,\r\nso named from the vast extent of the tidal marshes, these fields\r\nattain their greatest development. In central and southern Florida,\r\nhowever, where the seacoast is admirably suited for their development,\r\nthese coastal marshes of the grassy type disappear, their place being\r\ntaken by the peculiar morasses formed by the growth of the mangrove\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nIn the mangrove marshes the tree which gives the areas their name\r\ncovers all the field which is visited by the tide. This tree grows\r\nwith its crown supported on stiltlike roots, at a level above high\r\ntide. From its horizontal branches there grow off roots, which reach\r\ndownward into the water, and thence to the bottom. The seeds of the\r\nmangrove are admirably devised so as to enable the plant to obtain a\r\nfoothold on the mud flats, even where they are covered at low tide\r\nwith a depth of two or three feet of water. They are several inches in\r\nlength, and arranged with booklets at their lower ends; floating near\r\nthe bottom, they thus catch upon it, and in a few weeks' growth push\r\nthe shoot to the level of the water, thus affording a foundation for a\r\nnew plantation. In this manner, extending the old forests out into the\r\nshallow water of the bays, and forming new colonies wherever the water\r\nis not too deep, these plants rapidly occupy all the region which\r\nelsewhere would appear in the form of savannas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Diagram showing mode of growth of mangroves.]\r\n\r\nThe tidal marshes of North America, which may be in time converted to\r\nthe uses of man, probably occupy an area exceeding twenty thousand\r\nsquare miles. If the work of reclaiming such lands from the sea ever\r\nattains the advance in this country that it has done in Holland, the\r\narea added to the dry land by engineering devices may amount to as\r\nmuch as fifty thousand square miles--a territory rather greater than\r\nthe surface of Kentucky, and with a food-yielding power at least five\r\ntimes as great as is afforded by that fertile State. In fact, these\r\nconquests from the sea are hereafter to be among the great works which\r\nwill attract the energies of mankind. In the arid region of the\r\nCordilleras, as well as in many other countries, the soil, though\r\ndestitute of those qualities which make it fit for the uses of man,\r\nbecause of the absence of water in sufficient amount, is, as regards\r\nits structure and depth, as well as its mineral contents, admirably\r\nsuited to the needs of agriculture. The development of soils in desert\r\nregions is in almost all cases to be accounted for by the former\r\nexistence in the realms they occupy of a much greater rainfall than\r\nnow exists. Thus in the Rocky Mountain country, when the deep soils\r\nof the ample valleys were formed, the lakes, as we have before noted,\r\nwere no longer dead seas, as is at present so generally the case, but\r\npoured forth great streams to the sea. Here, as elsewhere, we find\r\nevidence that certain portions of the earth which recently had an\r\nabundant rainfall have now become starved for the lack of that supply.\r\nAll the soils of arid regions where the trial has been made have\r\nproved very fertile when subjected to irrigation, which can often be\r\naccomplished by storing the waters of the brief rainy season or by\r\ndiverting those of rivers which enter the deserts from well-watered\r\nmountain fields. In fact, the soil of these arid realms yields\r\npeculiarly ample returns to the husbandman, because of certain\r\nconditions due to the exceeding dryness of the air. This leads to an\r\nabsence of cloudy weather, so that from the time the seed is planted\r\nthe growth is stimulated by uninterrupted and intense sunshine. The\r\nsame dryness of the air leads, as we have seen, to a rapid evaporation\r\nfrom the surface, by which, in a manner before noted, the dissolved\r\nmineral matter is brought near the top of the soil, where it can best\r\nserve the greater part of our crop plants. On these accounts an acre\r\nof irrigated soil can be made to yield a far greater return than can\r\nbe obtained from land of like chemical composition in humid regions.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world, particularly in the northern and western\r\nportions of the Mississippi Valley, there are widespread areas, which,\r\nthough moderately well watered, were in their virgin state almost\r\nwithout forests. In the prairie region the early settlers found the\r\ncountry unwooded, except along the margins of the streams. On the\r\nborders of the true prairies, however, they found considerable areas\r\nof a prevailingly forested land, with here and there a tract of\r\nprairie. There were several of these open fields south of the Ohio,\r\nthough the country there is in general forested; one of these prairie\r\nareas, in the Green River district of Kentucky, was several thousand\r\nsquare miles in extent. At first it was supposed that the absence of\r\ntrees in the open country of the Mississippi Valley was due to some\r\npeculiarity of the soil, but experience shows that plantations\r\nluxuriantly develop, and that the timber will spread rapidly in the\r\nnatural way. In fact, if the seeds of the trees which have been\r\nplanted since the settlement of the country were allowed to develop as\r\nthey seek to do, it would only be a few centuries before the region\r\nwould be forest-clad as far west as the rainfall would permit the\r\nplants to develop. Probably the woods would attain to near the\r\nhundredth meridian.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the writer, the treeless character of the Western\r\nplains is mainly to be accounted for by the habit which our Indians\r\nhad of burning the herbage of a lowly sort each year, so that the\r\nlarge game might obtain better pasturage. It is a well-known fact to\r\nall those who have had to deal with cattle on fields which are in the\r\nnatural state that fire betters the pasturage. Beginning this method\r\nof burning in the arid regions to the west of the original forests,\r\nthe natural action of the fire has been gradually to destroy these\r\nwoods. Although the older and larger trees, on account of their thick\r\nbark and the height of their foliage above the ground, escaped\r\ndestruction, all the smaller and younger members of the species were\r\nconstantly swept away. Thus when the old trees died they left no\r\nsuccession, and the country assumed its prairie character. That the\r\nprairies were formed in this manner seems to be proved by the\r\ntestimony which we have concerning the open area before mentioned as\r\nhaving existed in western Kentucky. It is said that around the\r\ntimberless fields there was a wide fringe of old fire-scarred trees,\r\nwith no undergrowth beneath their branches, and that as they died no\r\nkind of large vegetation took their place. When the Indians who set\r\nthese fires were driven away, as was the case in the last decade of\r\nthe last century, the country at once began to resume its timbered\r\ncondition. From the margin and from every interior point where the\r\ntrees survived, their seeds spread so that before the open land was\r\nall subjugated to the plough it was necessary in many places to clear\r\naway a thick growth of the young forest-building trees.\r\n\r\nThe soils which develop on the lavas and ashes about an active volcano\r\nafford interesting subjects for study, for the reason that they show\r\nhow far the development of the layer which supports vegetation may\r\ndepend upon the character of the rocks from which it is derived. Where\r\nthe materials ejected from a volcano lie in a rainy district, the\r\nprocess of decay which converts the rock into soil is commonly very\r\nrapid, a few years of exposure to the weather being sufficient to\r\nbring about the formation of a fertile soil. This is due to the fact\r\nthat most lavas, as well as the so-called volcanic ashes, which are of\r\nthe same material as the lavas, only blown to pieces, are composed of\r\nvaried minerals, the most of which are readily attacked by the agents\r\nof decay. Now and then, however, we find the materials ejected from a\r\nparticular volcano, or even the lavas and ashes of a single eruption,\r\nin such a chemical state that soils form upon them with exceeding\r\nslowness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing incomplete considerations make it plain that the\r\nsoil-covering of the earth is the result of very delicate adjustments,\r\nwhich determine the rate at which the broken-down rocks find their\r\npath from their original bed places to the sea. The admirable way in\r\nwhich this movement is controlled is indicated by the fact that almost\r\neverywhere we find a soil-covering deep enough for the use of a varied\r\nvegetation, but rarely averaging more than a dozen feet in depth. Only\r\nhere and there are the rocks bare or the earth swathed in a profound\r\nmass of detritus. This indicates how steadfast and measured is the\r\nmarch of the rock waste from the hills to the sea. Unhappily, man,\r\nwhen by his needs he is forced to till the soil, is compelled to break\r\nup this ancient and perfect order. He has to strip the living mantle\r\nfrom the earth, replacing it with growth of those species which serve\r\nhis needs. Those plants which are most serviceable--which are, indeed,\r\nindispensable in the higher civilization, the grains--require for\r\ntheir cultivation that the earth be stripped bare and deeply stirred\r\nduring the rainy season, and thus subjected to the most destructive\r\neffect of the rainfall. The result is, that in almost all grain fields\r\nthe rate of soil destruction vastly surpasses that at which the\r\naccumulation is being made. We may say, indeed, that, except in\r\nalluvial plains, where the soil grows by flood-made additions to its\r\nupper surface, no field tilled in grain can without exceeding care\r\nremain usable for a century. Even though the agriculturist returns to\r\nthe earth all the chemical substances which he takes away in his\r\ncrops, the loss of the soil by the washing away of its substance to\r\nthe stream will inevitably reduce the region to sterility.\r\n\r\nIt is not fanciful to say that the greatest misfortune which in a\r\nlarge way man has had to meet in his agriculture arises from this\r\npeculiar stress which grain crops put upon the soil. If these grains\r\ngrew upon perennial plants, in the manner of our larger fruits, the\r\nproblem of man's relation to the soil would be much simpler than it is\r\nat present. He might then manage to till the earth without bringing\r\nupon it the inevitable destruction which he now inflicts. As it is, he\r\nshould recognise that his needs imperil this ancient and precious\r\nelement in the earth's structure, and he should endeavour in every\r\npossible way to minimize the damage which he brings about. This result\r\nhe may accomplish in certain simple ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards the fertility of the soil, as distinguished from the\r\nthickness of the coating, it may be said that modern discoveries\r\nenable us to see the ways whereby we may for an indefinite period\r\navoid the debasement of our great heritage, the food-giving earth. We\r\nnow know in various parts of the world extensive and practically\r\ninexhaustible deposits, whence may be obtained the phosphates,\r\npotash, soda, etc., which we take from the soil in our crops. We also\r\nhave learned ways in which the materials contained in our sewage may\r\nbe kept from the sea and restored to the fields. In fact, the recent\r\ndevelopments of agriculture have made it not only easy, but in most\r\ncases profitable, to avoid this waste of materials which has reduced\r\nso many regions to poverty. We may fairly look forward to the time,\r\nnot long distant, when the old progressive degradation in the\r\nfertility of the soil coating will no longer occur. It is otherwise\r\nwith the mass of the soil, that body of commingled decayed rock and\r\nvegetable matter which must possess a certain thickness in order to\r\nserve its needs. As yet no considerable arrest has been made in the\r\nprocesses which lead to the destruction of this earthy mass. In all\r\ncountries where tillage is general the rivers are flowing charged with\r\nall they can bear away of soil material. Thus in the valley of the Po,\r\na region where, if the soil were forest-clad, the down-wearing of the\r\nsurface would probably be at no greater rate than one foot in five\r\nthousand years, the river bears away the soil detritus so rapidly that\r\nat the present time the downgoing is at the rate of one foot in eight\r\nhundred years, and each decade sees the soil disappear from hillsides\r\nwhich were once fertile, but are now reduced to bare rocks. All about\r\nthe Mediterranean the traveller notes extensive regions which were\r\nonce covered with luxuriant forests, and were afterward the seats of\r\nprosperous agriculture, where the soil has utterly disappeared,\r\nleaving only the bare rocks, which could not recover its natural\r\ncovering in thousands of years of the enforced fallow.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the United States the degradation of the soil,\r\nowing to the peculiar conditions of the country, is in many districts\r\ngoing forward with startling rapidity. It has been the habit of our\r\npeople--a habit favoured by the wide extent of fertile and easily\r\nacquired frontier ground--recklessly to till their farms until the\r\nfields were exhausted, and then to abandon them for new ground. By\r\nshallow ploughing on steep hillsides, by neglect in the beginning of\r\nthose gulches which form in such places, it is easy in the hill\r\ncountry of the eastern United States to have the soil washed away\r\nwithin twenty years after the protecting forests have been destroyed.\r\nThe writer has estimated that in the States south of the Ohio and\r\nJames Rivers more than eight thousand square miles of originally\r\nfertile ground have by neglect been brought into a condition where it\r\nwill no longer bear crops of any kind, and over fifteen hundred miles\r\nof the area have been so worn down to the subsoil or the bed rock that\r\nit may never be profitable to win it again to agricultural uses.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in our American agriculture, our people have been to a great\r\nextent pioneers; they have been compelled to win what they could in\r\nthe cheapest possible way and with the rudest implements, and without\r\nmuch regard to the future of those who were in subsequent generations\r\nto occupy the fields which they were conquering from the wilderness\r\nand the savages. The danger is now that this reckless tillage, in a\r\nway justified of old, may be continued and become habitual with our\r\npeople. It is, indeed, already a fixed habit in many parts of the\r\ncountry, particularly in the South, where a small farmer expects to\r\nwear out two or three plantations in the course of his natural life.\r\nMany of them manage to ruin from one to two hundred acres of land in\r\nthe course of half a century of uninterrupted labour. This system\r\ndeserves the reprobation of all good citizens; it would be well,\r\nindeed, if it were possible to do so, to stamp it out by the law. The\r\nsame principle which makes it illegal for a man to burn his own\r\ndwelling house may fairly be applied in restraining him from\r\ndestroying the land which he tills.\r\n\r\nThere are a few simple principles which, if properly applied, may\r\nserve to correct this misuse of our American soil. The careful tiller\r\nshould note that all soils whatever which lie on declivities having a\r\nslope of more than one foot in thirty inevitably and rapidly waste\r\nwhen subject to plough tillage. This instrument tends to smear and\r\nconsolidate the layer of earth over which its heel runs, so that at a\r\ndepth of a few inches below the surface a layer tolerably impervious\r\nto water is formed. The result is that the porous portion of the\r\ndeposit becomes excessively charged with water in times of heavy rain,\r\nand moves down the hillside in a rapid manner. All such steep slopes\r\nshould be left in their wooded state, or, if brought into use, should\r\nbe retained as pasture lands.\r\n\r\nWhere, as is often the case with the farms in hilly countries, all the\r\nfields are steeply inclined, it is an excellent precaution to leave\r\nthe upper part of the slope with a forest covering. In this condition\r\nnot only is the excessive flow of surface water diminished, but the\r\nmoisture which creeps down the slope from the wooded area tends to\r\nkeep the lower-lying fields in a better state for tillage, and\r\npromotes the decay of the underlying rocks, and thus adds to the body\r\nand richness of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn those soils which must be tilled, even where they tend to wash\r\naway, the aim should be to keep the detritus open to such a depth that\r\nit may take in as much as possible of the rainfall, yielding the water\r\nto the streams through the springs. This end can generally be\r\naccomplished by deep ploughing; it can, in almost all cases, be\r\nattained by under-drainage. The effect of allowing the water to\r\npenetrate is not only to diminish the superficial wearing, but to\r\nmaintain the process of subsoil and bed-rock decay by which the\r\ndetrital covering is naturally renewed. Where, as in many parts of the\r\ncountry, the washing away of the soil can not otherwise be arrested,\r\nthe progress of the destruction can be delayed by forming with the\r\nskilful use of the plough ditches of slight declivity leading along\r\nthe hillsides to the natural waterways. One of the most satisfactory\r\nmarks of the improvement which is now taking place in the agriculture\r\nof the cotton-yielding States of this country is to be found in the\r\nrapid increase in the use of the ditch system here mentioned. This\r\nsystem, combined with ploughing in the manner where the earth is with\r\neach overturning thrown uphill, will greatly reduce the destructive\r\neffect of rainfall on steep-lying fields. But the only effective\r\nprotection, however, is accomplished by carefully terracing the\r\nslopes, so that the tilled ground lies in level benches. This system\r\nis extensively followed in the thickly settled portions of Europe, but\r\nit may be a century before it will be much used in this country.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the soil-tiller by the earth with which he deals may be\r\nbriefly summed up: He should look upon himself as an agent necessarily\r\ninterfering with the operations which naturally form and preserve the\r\nsoil. He should see that his work brings two risks; he may impoverish\r\nthe accumulation of detrital material by taking out the plant food\r\nmore rapidly than it is prepared for use. This injurious result may be\r\nat any time reparable by a proper use of manures. Not so, however,\r\nwith the other form of destruction, which results in the actual\r\nremoval of the soil materials. Where neglect has brought about this\r\ndisaster, it can only be repaired by leaving the area to recover\r\nbeneath the slowly formed forest coating. This process in almost all\r\ncases requires many thousands of years for its accomplishment. The man\r\nwho has wrought such destruction has harmed the inheritance of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                     THE ROCKS AND THEIR ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters of this book the attention of the student\r\nhas been directed mainly to the operations of those natural forces\r\nwhich act upon the surface of the earth. Incidentally the consequences\r\narising from the applications of energy to the outer part of the\r\nplanet have been attended to, but the main aim has been to set forth\r\nthe work which solar energy, operating in the form of heat,\r\naccomplishes upon the lands. We have now to consider one of the great\r\nresults of these actions, which is exhibited in the successive strata\r\nthat make up the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy effect arising from the action of the solar forces\r\non the earth and their co-operation with those which originate in our\r\nsphere is found in the destruction of beds or other deposits of rock,\r\nand the removal of the materials to the floors of water basins, where\r\nthey are again aggregated in strata, and gradually brought once more\r\ninto a stable condition within the earth. This work is accomplished by\r\nwater in its various states, the action being directly affected by\r\ngravitation. In the form of steam, water which has been built into\r\nrocks and volcanically expelled by tensions, due to the heat which it\r\nhas acquired at great depths below the surface, blows forth great\r\nquantities of lava, which is contributed to the formation of strata,\r\neither directly in the solid form or indirectly, after having been\r\ndissolved in the sea. Acting as waves, water impelled by solar energy\r\ntransmitted to it by the winds beats against the shores, wearing away\r\ngreat quantities of rock, which is dragged off to the neighbouring sea\r\nbottoms, there to resume the bedded form. Moving ice in glaciers,\r\nwater again applying solar energy given to it by its elevation above\r\nthe sea, most effectively grinds away the elevated parts of the crust,\r\nthe _débris_ being delivered to the ocean. In the rain the same work\r\nis done, and even in the wind the power of the sun serves to abrade\r\nthe high-lying rocks, making new strata of their fragments.\r\n\r\nAs gravity enters as an element in all the movements of divided rock,\r\nthe tendency of the waste worn from the land is to gather on to the\r\nbottoms of basins which contain water. Rarely, and only in a small\r\nway, this process results in the accumulation of lake deposits; the\r\ngreater part of the work is done upon the sea floor. When the beds are\r\nformed in lake basins, they may be accumulated in either of two very\r\ndiverse conditions. They may be formed in what are called dead seas,\r\nin which case the detrital materials are commonly small in amount, for\r\nthe reason that the inflowing streams are inconsiderable; in such\r\nbasins there is normally a large share of saline materials, which are\r\nlaid down by the evaporation of the water. In ordinary lakes the\r\ndeposits which are formed are mostly due to the sediment that the\r\nrivers import. These materials are usually fine-grained, and the sand\r\nor pebbles which they contain are plentifully mingled with clay. Hence\r\nlake deposits are usually of an argillaceous nature. As organic life,\r\nsuch as secretes limestone, is rarely developed to any extent in lake\r\nbasins, limy beds are very rarely formed beneath those areas of water.\r\nWhere they occur, they are generally due to the fact that rivers\r\ncharged with limy matter import such quantities of the substance that\r\nit is precipitated on the bottom.\r\n\r\nAs lake deposits are normally formed in basins above the level of the\r\nsea, and as the drainage channels of the basins are always cutting\r\ndown, the effect is to leave such strata at a considerable height\r\nabove the sea level, where the erosive agents may readily attack them.\r\nIn consequence of this condition, lacustrine beds are rarely found of\r\ngreat antiquity; they generally disappear soon after they are formed.\r\nWhere preserved, their endurance is generally to be attributed to the\r\nfact that the region they occupy has been lowered beneath the sea and\r\ncovered by marine strata.\r\n\r\nThe great laboratory in which the sedimentary deposits are\r\naccumulated, the realm in which at least ninety-nine of the hundred\r\nparts of these materials are laid down, is the oceanic part of the\r\nearth. On the floors of the seas and oceans we have not only the\r\nregion where the greater part of the sedimentation is effected, but\r\nthat in which the work assumes the greatest variety. The sea bottoms,\r\nas regards the deposits formed upon them, are naturally divided into\r\ntwo regions--the one in which the _débris_ from the land forms an\r\nimportant part of the sediment, and the other, where the remoteness\r\nof the shores deprives the sediment of land waste, or at least of\r\nenough of that material in any such share as can affect the character\r\nof the deposits.\r\n\r\nWhat we may term the littoral or shore zone of the sea occupies a belt\r\nof prevailingly shallow water, varying in width from a few score to a\r\nfew hundred miles. Where the bottom descends steeply from the coast,\r\nwhere there are no strong off-shore setting currents, and where the\r\nregion is not near the mouth of a large river which bears a great tide\r\nof sediment to the sea, the land waste may not affect the bottom for\r\nmore than a mile or two from the shore. Where these conditions are\r\nreversed, the _débris_ from the air-covered region may be found three\r\nor four hundred miles from the coast line. It should also be noted\r\nthat the incessant up-and-down goings of the land result in a constant\r\nchange in the position of the coast line, and consequently in the\r\nextension of the land sediment, in the course of a few geological\r\nperiods over a far wider field of sea bottom than that to which they\r\nwould attain if the shores remained steadfast.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the sediments deposited within the influence\r\nof the continental detritus that they vary very much in their action,\r\nand that this variation takes place not only horizontally along the\r\nshores in the same stratum, but vertically, in the succession of the\r\nbeds. It also may be traced down the slope from the coast line to deep\r\nwater. Thus where all the _débris_ comes from the action of the waves,\r\nthe deposits formed from the shore outwardly will consist of coarse\r\nmaterials, such as pebbles near the coast, of sand in the deeper and\r\nremoter section, and of finer silt in the part of the deposit which is\r\nfarthest out. With each change in the level of the coast line the\r\nposition of these belts will necessarily be altered. Where a great\r\nriver enters the sea, the changes in the volume of sediment which it\r\nfrom time to time sends forth, together with the alternations in the\r\nposition of its point of discharge, led to great local complexities in\r\nthe strata. Moreover, the turbid water sent forth by the stream may,\r\nas in the case of the tide from the Amazon, be drifted for hundreds of\r\nmiles along the coast line or into the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe most important variations which occur in the deposits of the\r\nlittoral zone are brought about by the formations of rocks more or\r\nless composed of limestone. Everywhere the sea is, as compared with\r\nlake waters, remarkably rich in organic life. Next the shore, partly\r\nbecause the water is there shallow, but also because of its relative\r\nwarmth and the extent to which it is in motion, organic life, both\r\nthat of animals and plants, commonly develops in a very luxuriant way.\r\nOnly where the bottom is composed of drifting sands, which do not\r\nafford a foothold for those species which need to rest upon the shore,\r\ndo we fail to find that surface thickly tenanted with varied forms.\r\nThese are arranged according to the depth of the bottom. The species\r\nof marine plants which are attached to fixed objects are limited to\r\nthe depth within which the sunlight effectively penetrates the water;\r\nin general, it may be said that they do not extend below a depth of\r\none hundred feet. The animal forms are distributed, according to their\r\nkinds, over the floor, but few species having the capacity to endure\r\nany great range in the pressure of the sea water. Only a few forms,\r\nindeed, extend from low tide to the depth of a thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe greatest development of organic life, the realm in which the\r\nlargest number of species occur, and where their growth is most rapid,\r\nlies within about a hundred feet of the low-tide level. Here sunlight,\r\nwarmth, and motion in the water combine to favour organic development.\r\nIt is in this region that coral reefs and other great accumulations of\r\nlimestone, formed from the skeletons of polyps and mollusks, most\r\nabundantly occur. These deposits of a limy nature depend upon a very\r\ndelicate adjustment of the conditions which favour the growth of\r\ncertain creatures; very slight geographic changes, by inducing\r\nmovements of sand or mud, are apt to interrupt their formation,\r\nbringing about a great and immediate alteration in the character of\r\nthe deposits. Thus it is that where geologists find considerable\r\nfields of rock, where limestones are intercalated with sandstones and\r\ndeposits of clay, they are justified in assuming that the strata were\r\nlaid down near some ancient shore. In general, these coast deposits\r\nbecome more and more limy as we go toward the tropical realms, and\r\nthis for the reason that the species which secrete large amounts of\r\nlime are in those regions most abundant and attain the most rapid\r\ngrowth. The stony polyps, the most vigorous of the limestone makers,\r\ngrow in large quantities only in the tropical realm, or near to it,\r\nwhere ocean streams of great warmth may provide the creatures with the\r\nconditions of temperature and food which they need.\r\n\r\nAs we pass from the shore to the deeper sea, the share of land\r\ndetritus rapidly diminishes until, as before remarked, at the distance\r\nof five hundred miles from the coast line, very little of that waste,\r\nexcept that from volcanoes, attains the bottom of the sea. By far the\r\nlarger part of the contributions which go to the formation of these\r\ndeep-sea strata come from organic remains, which are continually\r\nfalling upon the sea floor. In part, this waste is derived from\r\ncreatures which dwell upon the bottom; in considerable measure,\r\nhowever, it is from the dead bodies of those forms which live near the\r\nsurface of the sea, and which when dying sink slowly through the\r\nintermediate realm to the bottom.\r\n\r\nOwing to the absence of sunlight, the prevailingly cold water of the\r\ndeeper seas, and the lack of vegetation in those realms, the growth of\r\norganic forms on the deep-sea floor is relatively slow. Thus it\r\nhappens that each shell or other contribution to the sediment lies for\r\nsome time on the bottom before it is buried. While in this condition\r\nit is apt to be devoured by some of the many species which dwell on\r\nthe bottom and subsist from the remains of animals and plants which\r\nthey find there. In all cases the fossilization of any form depends\r\nupon the accumulation of sediment before the processes of destruction\r\nhave overtaken them, and among these processes we must give the first\r\nplace to the creatures which subsist on shells, bones, or other\r\nsubstances of like nature which find their way to the ocean floor. In\r\nthe absolute darkness, the still water, and the exceeding cold of the\r\ndeeper seas, animals find difficult conditions for development.\r\nMoreover, in this deep realm there is no native vegetation, and, in\r\ngeneral, but little material of this nature descends to the bottom\r\nfrom the surface of the sea. The result is, the animals have to\r\nsubsist on the remains of other animals which at some step in the\r\nsuccession have obtained their provender from the plants which belong\r\non the surface or in the shallow waters of the sea. This limitation\r\nof the food supply causes the depths of the sea to be a realm of\r\ncontinual hunger, a region where every particle of organic matter is\r\napt to be seized upon by some needy creature.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the fact that little organic matter on the deeper\r\nsea floors escapes being devoured, the most of the material of this\r\nnature which goes into strata enters that state in a finely divided\r\ncondition. In the group of worms alone--forms which in a great\r\ndiversity of species inhabit the sea floor--we find creatures which\r\nare specially adapted to digesting the _débris_ which gathers on the\r\nsea bottom. Wandering over this surface, much in the manner of our\r\nordinary earthworms, these creatures devour the mud, voiding the\r\nmatter from their bodies in a yet more perfectly divided form. Hence\r\nit comes about that the limestone beds, so commonly formed beneath the\r\nopen seas, are generally composed of materials which show but few and\r\nvery imperfect fossils. Studying any series of limestone beds, we\r\ncommonly find that each layer, in greater or less degree, is made up\r\nof rather massive materials, which evidently came to their place in\r\nthe form of a limy mud. Very often this lime has crystallized, and\r\nthus has lost all trace of its original organic structure.\r\n\r\nOne of the conspicuous features which may be observed in any\r\nsuccession of limestone beds is the partings or divisions into layers\r\nwhich occur with varied frequency. Sometimes at vertical intervals of\r\nnot more than one or two inches, again with spacings of a score of\r\nfeet, we find divisional planes, which indicate a sudden change in the\r\nprocess of rock formation. The lime disappears, and in place of it we\r\nhave a thin layer of very fine detritus, which takes on the form of a\r\nclay. Examining these partings with care, we observe that on the upper\r\nsurface on the limestone the remains of the animal which dwelt on the\r\nancient sea floor are remarkably well preserved, they having evidently\r\nescaped the effect of the process which reduced their ancestors,\r\nwhose remains constitute the layer, to mud. Furthermore, we note that\r\nthe shaly layer is not only lacking in lime, but commonly contains no\r\ntrace of animals such as might have dwelt on the bottom. The fossils\r\nit bears are usually of species which swam in the overlying water and\r\ncame to the bottom after death. Following up through the layer of\r\nshale, we note that the ordinary bottom life gradually reappears, and\r\nshortly becomes so plentiful that the deposit resumes the character\r\nwhich it had before the interruption began. Often, however, we note\r\nthat the assemblage of species which dwelt on the given area of sea\r\nfloor has undergone a considerable change. Forms in existence in the\r\nlower layer may be lacking in the upper, their place being taken by\r\nnew varieties.\r\n\r\nSo far the origin of these divisional planes in marine deposits has\r\nreceived little attention from geologists; they have, indeed, assumed\r\nthat each of these alterations indicates some sudden disturbance of\r\nthe life of the sea floors. They have, however, generally assumed that\r\nthe change was due to alterations in the depth of the sea or in the\r\nrun of ocean currents. It seems to the writer, however, that while\r\nthese divisions may in certain cases be due to the above-mentioned\r\nand, indeed, to a great variety of causes, they are in general best to\r\nbe explained by the action of earthquakes. Water being an exceedingly\r\nelastic substance, an earthquake passes through it with much greater\r\nspeed than it traverses the rocks which support the ocean floor. The\r\nresult is that, when the fluid and solid oscillate in the repeated\r\nswingings which a shock causes, they do not move together, but rub\r\nover each other, the independent movements having the swing of from a\r\nfew inches to a foot or two in shocks of considerable energy.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea bottom and the overlying water, vibrating under the\r\nimpulse of an earthquake shock, move past each other, the inevitable\r\nresult is the formation of muddy water; the very fine silt of the\r\nbottom is shaken up into the fluid, which afterward descends as a\r\nsheet to its original position. It is a well-known fact that such\r\nmuddying of water, in which species accustomed to other conditions\r\ndwell, inevitably leads to their death by covering their breathing\r\norgans and otherwise disturbing the delicately balanced conditions\r\nwhich enable them to exist. We find, in fact, that most of the tenants\r\nof the water, particularly the forms which dwell upon the bottom, are\r\nprovided with an array of contrivances which enable them to clear away\r\nfrom their bodies such small quantities of silt as may inconvenience\r\nthem. Thus, in the case of our common clam, the breathing organs are\r\ncovered with vibratory cilia, which, acting like brooms, sweep off any\r\nforeign matter which may come upon their surfaces. Moreover, the\r\ncreature has a long, double, spoutlike organ, which it can elevate\r\nsome distance above the bottom, through which it draws and discharges\r\nthe water from which it obtains food and air. Other forms, such as the\r\ncrinoids, or sea lilies, elevate the breathing parts on top of tall\r\nstems of marvellous construction, which brings those vital organs at\r\nthe level, it may be, of three or four feet above the zone of mud. In\r\nconsequence of the peculiar method of growth, the crinoids often\r\nescape the damage done by the disturbance of the bottom, and thus form\r\nlimestone beds of remarkable thickness; sometimes, indeed, we find\r\nthese layers composed mainly of crinoidal remains, which exhibit only\r\nslight traces of partings such as we have described, being essentially\r\nunited for the depth of ten or twenty feet. Where the layers have been\r\nmainly accumulated by shellfish, their average thickness is less than\r\nhalf a foot.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the partitions between the layers of limestone, we\r\ncommonly find that, however thin, they generally extend for an\r\nindefinite distance in every direction. The writer has traced some of\r\nthese for miles; never, indeed, has he been able to find where they\r\ndisappeared. This fact makes it clear that the destruction which took\r\nplace at the stage where these partings were formed was widespread; so\r\nfar as it was due to earthquake shocks, we may fairly believe that in\r\nmany cases it occurred over areas which were to be measured by tens of\r\nthousands of square miles. Indeed, from what we know of earthquake\r\nshocks, it seems likely that the devastation may at times have\r\naffected millions of square miles.\r\n\r\nAnother class of accidents connected with earthquakes may also\r\nsuddenly disturb the mud on the sea bottom. When, as elsewhere noted,\r\na shock originates beneath the sea, the effect is suddenly to elevate\r\nthe water over the seat of the jarring and the regions thereabouts to\r\nthe height of some feet. This elevation quickly takes the shape of a\r\nringlike wave, which rolls off in every direction from its point of\r\norigin. Where the sea is deep, the effect of this wave on the bottom\r\nmay be but slight; but as the undulation attains shallower water, and\r\nin proportion to the shoaling, the front of the surge is retarded in\r\nits advance by the friction of the bottom, while the rear part, being\r\nin deeper water, crowds upon the advancing line. The action is\r\nprecisely that which has been described as occurring in wind-made\r\nwaves as they approach the beach; but in this last-named group of\r\nundulations, because of the great width of the swell, the effect of\r\nthe shallowing is evident in much deeper water. It is likely that at\r\nthe depth of a thousand feet the passing of one of these vast surges\r\nborn of earthquakes may so stir the mud of the sea floor as to bring\r\nabout a widespread destruction of life, and thus give rise to many of\r\nthe partitions between strata.\r\n\r\nIf we examine with the microscope the fine-grained silts which make up\r\nthe shaly layers between limestones, we find the materials to be\r\nmostly of inorganic origin. It is hard to trace the origin of the\r\nmineral matter which it contains; some of the fragments are likely to\r\nprove of Volcanic origin; others, bits of dust from meteorites; yet\r\nothers, dust blown from the land, which may, as we know, be conveyed\r\nfor any distance across the seas. Mingled with this sediment of an\r\ninorganic origin we almost invariably find a share of organic waste,\r\nderived not from creatures which dwelt upon the bottom, but from those\r\nwhich inhabited the higher-lying waters. If, now, we take a portion of\r\nthe limestone layer which lies above or below the shale parting, and\r\ncarefully dissolve out with acids the limy matter which it contains,\r\nwe obtain a residuum which in general character, except so far as the\r\nparticles may have been affected by the acid, is exactly like the\r\nmaterial which forms the claylike partition. We are thus readily led\r\nto the conclusion that on the floors of the deeper seas there is\r\nconstantly descending, in the form of a very slow shower, a mass of\r\nmineral detritus. Where organic life belonging to the species which\r\nsecrete hard shells or skeletons is absent, this accumulation,\r\nproceeding with exceeding slowness, gradually accumulates layers,\r\nwhich take on a shaly character. Where limestone-making animals\r\nabound, they so increase the rate of deposition that the proportion of\r\nthe mineral material in the growing strata is very much reduced; it\r\nmay, indeed, become as small as one per cent of the mass. In this case\r\nwe may say that the deposit of limestone grew a hundred times as fast\r\nas the intervening beds of shale.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations make it tolerably clear that the sea\r\nfloor is in receipt of two diverse classes of sediment--those of a\r\nmineral and those of an organic origin. The mineral, or inorganic,\r\nmaterials predominate along the shores. They gradually diminish in\r\nquantity toward the open sea, where the supply is mainly dependent on\r\nthe substances thrown forth from volcanoes, on pumice in its massive\r\nor its comminuted form--i.e., volcanic dust, states of lava in which\r\nthe material, because of the vesicles which it contains, can float for\r\nages before it comes to rest on the sea bottom. Variations in the\r\nvolcanic waste contributed to the sea floor may somewhat affect the\r\nquantity of the inorganic sediments, but, as a whole, the downfalling\r\nof these fragments is probably at a singularly uniform rate. It is\r\notherwise with the contributions of sediment arising from organic\r\nforms. This varies in a surprising measure. On the coral reefs, such\r\nas form in the mid oceans, the proportion of matter which has not come\r\ninto the accumulation through the bodies of animals and plants may be\r\nas small as one tenth of one per cent, or less. In the deeper seas, it\r\nis doubtful whether the rate of animal growth is such as to permit the\r\nformation of any beds which have less than one half of their mass made\r\nup of materials which fell through the water.\r\n\r\nIn certain areas of the open seas the upper part of the water is dwelt\r\nin by a host of creatures, mostly foraminifera, which extract\r\nlimestone from the water, and, on dying, send their shells to the\r\nbottom. Thus in the North Atlantic, even where the sea floor is of\r\ngreat depth beneath the surface, there is constantly accumulating a\r\nmass of limy matter, which is forming very massive limestone strata,\r\nsomewhat resembling chalk deposits, such as abundantly occur in Great\r\nBritain, in the neighbouring parts of Europe, in Texas, and elsewhere.\r\nAccumulations such as this, where the supply is derived from the\r\nsurface of the water, are not affected by the accidents which divide\r\nbeds made on the bottom in the manner before described. They may,\r\ntherefore, have the singularly continuous character which we note in\r\nthe English chalk, where, for the thickness of hundreds of feet, we\r\nmay have no evident partitions, except certain divisions, which have\r\nevidently originated long after the beds were formed.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that, while the floors of the deeper\r\nseas appear to lack mountainous elevations, those arising from the\r\nfolding of strata, they are plentifully scattered over with volcanic\r\ncones. We may therefore suppose that, in general, the deposits formed\r\non the sea floor are to a great extent affected by the materials which\r\nthese vents cast forth. Lava streams and showers represent only a\r\npart of the contributions from volcanoes, which finally find their way\r\nto the bottom. In larger part, the materials thrown forth are probably\r\nfirst dissolved in the water and then taken up by the organic species;\r\nonly after the death of these creatures does the waste go to the\r\nbottom. As hosts of these creatures have no solid skeleton to\r\ncontribute to the sea floor, such mineral matter as they may obtain is\r\nafter their death at once restored to the sea.\r\n\r\nNot only does the contribution of organic sediment diminish in\r\nquantity with the depth which is attained, but the deeper parts of the\r\nocean bed appear to be in a condition where no accumulations of this\r\nnature are made, and this for the reason that the water dissolves the\r\norganic matter more rapidly than it is laid down. Thus in place of\r\nlimestone, which would otherwise form, we have only a claylike\r\nresiduum, such as is obtained when we dissolve lime rocks in acids.\r\nThis process of solution, by which the limy matter deposited on the\r\nbottom is taken back into the water, goes on everywhere, but at a rate\r\nwhich increases with the depth. This increase is due in part to the\r\naugmentation of pressure, and in part to the larger share of carbonic\r\ndioxide which the water at great depths holds. The result is, that\r\nexplorations with the dredge seem to indicate that on certain parts of\r\nthe deeper sea floors the rocks are undergoing a process of\r\ndissolution comparable to that which takes place in limestone caverns.\r\nSo considerable is the solvent work that a large part of the inorganic\r\nwaste appears to be taken up by the waters, so as to leave the bottom\r\nessentially without sedimentary accumulations. The sea, in a word,\r\nappears to be eating into rocks which it laid down before the\r\ndepression attained its present great depth.\r\n\r\nWe should here note something of the conditions which determine the\r\nsupply of food which the marine animals obtain. First of all, we may\r\nrecur to the point that the ocean waters appear to contain something\r\nof all the earth materials which do not readily decompose when they\r\nare taken into the state of solution. These mineral substances,\r\nincluding the metals, are obtained in part from the lands, through the\r\naction of the rain water and the waves, but perhaps in larger share\r\nfrom the volcanic matter which, in the form of floating lava, pumice,\r\nor dust, is plentifully delivered to the sea. Except doubtfully, and\r\nat most in a very small way, this chemical store of the sea water can\r\nnot be directly taken into the structures of animals; it can only be\r\nimmediately appropriated by the marine plants. These forms can only\r\ndevelop in that superficial realm of the seas which is penetrated by\r\nthe sunlight, or say within the depth of five hundred feet, mostly\r\nwithin one hundred feet of the surface, about one thirtieth of the\r\naverage, and about one fiftieth of the maximum ocean depth. On this\r\nmarine plant life, and in a small measure on the vegetable matter\r\nderived from the land, the marine animals primarily depend for their\r\nprovender. Through the conditions which bring about the formation of\r\n_Sargassum_ seas, those areas of the ocean where seaweeds grow afloat,\r\nas well as by the water-logging and weighting down of other vegetable\r\nmatter, some part of the plant remains is carried to the sea floor,\r\neven to great depths; but the main dependence of the deep-sea forms of\r\nanimals is upon other animal forms, which themselves may have obtained\r\ntheir store from yet others. In fact, in any deep-sea form we might\r\nfind it necessary to trace back the food by thousands of steps before\r\nwe found the creature which had access to the vegetable matter. It is\r\neasy to see how such conditions profoundly limit the development of\r\norganic being in the abysm of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe sedentary animals, or those which are fixed to the sea bottom--a\r\ngroup which includes the larger part of the marine species--have to\r\ndepend for their sustenance on the movement of the water which passes\r\ntheir station. If the seas were perfectly still, none of these\r\ncreatures except the most minute could be fed; therefore the currents\r\nof the ocean go far by their speed to determine the rate at which life\r\nmay flourish. At great depths, as we have seen, these movements are\r\npractically limited to that which is caused by the slow movement which\r\nthe tide brings about. The amount of this motion is proportional to\r\nthe depth of the sea; in the deeper parts, it carries the water to and\r\nfro twice each day for the distance of about two hundred and fifty\r\nfeet. In the shallower water this motion increases in proportion to\r\nthe shoaling, and in the regions near the shores the currents of the\r\nsea which, except the massive drift from the poles, do not usually\r\ntouch the bottom, begin to have their influence. Where the water is\r\nless than a hundred feet in depth, each wave contributes to the\r\nmovement, which attains its maximum near the shore, where every surge\r\nsweeps the water rapidly to and fro. It is in this surge belt, where\r\nthe waves are broken, that marine animals are best provided with food,\r\nand it is here that their growth is most rapid. If the student will\r\nobtain a pint of water from the surf, he will find that it is clouded\r\nby fragments of organic matter, the quantity in a pound of the fluid\r\noften amounting to the fiftieth part of its weight. He will thus\r\nperceive that along the shore line, though the provision of victuals\r\nis most abundant, the store is made from the animals and plants which\r\nare ground up in the mill. In a word, while the coast is a place of\r\nrapid growth, it is also a region of rapid destruction; only in the\r\ncase of the coral animals, which associate their bodies with a number\r\nof myriads in large and elaborately organized communities, do we find\r\nanimals which can make such head against the action of the waves that\r\nthey can build great deposits in their realm.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that a part of the advantage which is afforded to\r\norganic life by the shore belt is due to the fact that the waters are\r\nthere subjected to a constant process of aëration by the whipping into\r\nfoam and spray which occurs where the waves overturn.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to the student to note the great number of\r\nmechanical contrivances which have been devised to give security to\r\nanimals and plants which face these difficult conditions arising from\r\nsuccessive violent blows of falling water. Among these may be briefly\r\nnoted those of the limpets--mollusks which dwell in a conical shell,\r\nwhich faces the water with a domelike outside, and which at the moment\r\nof the stroke is drawn down upon the rock by the strong muscle which\r\nfastens the creature to its foundation. The barnacles, which with\r\ntheir wedge-shaped prows cut the water at the moment of the stroke,\r\nbut open in the pauses between the waves, so that the creature may\r\nwith its branching arms grasp at the food which floats about it; the\r\nnullipores, forms of seaweed which are framed of limestone and cling\r\nfirmly to the rock--afford yet other instances of protective\r\nadaptations contrived to insure the safety of creatures which dwell in\r\nthe field of abundant food supply.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe facts above presented will show the reader that the marine\r\nsediments are formed under conditions which permit a great variety in\r\nthe nature of the materials of which they are composed. As soon as the\r\ndeposits are built into rocks and covered by later accumulations,\r\ntheir materials enter the laboratory of the under earth, where they\r\nare subjected to progressive changes. Even before they have attained a\r\ngreat depth, through the laying down of later deposits upon them,\r\nchanges begin which serve to alter their structure. The fragments of a\r\nsoluble kind begin to be dissolved, and are redeposited, so that the\r\nmass commonly becomes much more solid, passing from the state of\r\ndetritus to that of more or less solid rock. When yet more deeply\r\nburied, and thereby brought into a realm of greater warmth, or perhaps\r\nwhen penetrated by dikes and thereby heated, these changes go yet\r\nfurther. More of the material is commonly rearranged by solution and\r\nredeposition, so that limestone may be converted into crystalline\r\nmarble, granular sandstones into firm masses, known as quartzites, and\r\nclays into the harder form of slate. Where the changes go to the\r\nextreme point, rocks originally distinctly bedded probably may be so\r\ntaken to pieces and made over that all traces of their stratification\r\nmay be destroyed, all fossils obliterated, and the stone transformed\r\ninto mica schist, or granite or other crystalline rock. It may be\r\ninjected into the overlying strata in the form of dikes, or it may be\r\nblown forth into the air through volcanoes. Involved in\r\nmountain-folding, after being more or less changed in the manner\r\ndescribed, the beds may become tangled together like the rumpled\r\nleaves of a book, or even with the complexity of snarled thread. All\r\nthese changes of condition makes it difficult for the geologist to\r\nunravel the succession of strata so that he may know the true order of\r\nthe rocks, and read from them the story of the successive geological\r\nperiods. This task, though incomplete, has by the labours of many\r\nthousand men been so far advanced that we are now able to divide the\r\nrecord into chapters, the divisions of the geologic ages, and to give\r\nsome account of the succession of events, organic and geographic,\r\nwhich have occurred since life began to write its records.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary experience we seem to behold the greater part of the earth\r\nwhich meets our eyes as fixed in its position. A better understanding\r\nshows us that nothing in this world is immovable. In the realm of the\r\ninorganic world the atoms and molecules even in solid bodies have to\r\nbe conceived as endowed with ceaseless though ordered motions. Even\r\nwhen matter is built into the solid rock, it is doubtful whether any\r\ngrain of it ever comes really to rest. Under the strains which arise\r\nfrom the contraction of the earth's interior and the chemical changes\r\nwhich the rocks undergo, each bit is subject to ever-changing\r\nthrusts, which somewhat affect its position. If we in any way could\r\nbring a grain of sand from any stratum under a microscope, so that we\r\ncould perceive its changes of place, we should probably find that it\r\nwas endlessly swaying this way and that, with reference to an ideally\r\nfixed point, such as the centre of the earth. But even that centre,\r\nwhether of gravity or of figure, is probably never at rest.\r\n\r\nEarth movements may be divided into two groups--those which arise from\r\nthe bodily shifting of matter, which conveys the particles this way or\r\nthat, or, as we say, change their place, and those which merely\r\nproduce vibration, in which the particles, after their vibratory\r\nmovement, return to their original place. For purposes of illustration\r\nthe first, or translatory motion, may be compared to that which takes\r\nplace when a bell is carried along upon a locomotive or a ship; and\r\nthe second, or vibratory movement, to what takes place when the bell\r\nis by a blow made to ring. It is with these ringing movements, as we\r\nmay term them, that we find ourselves concerned when we undertake the\r\nstudy of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the reader should preface his study of\r\nearthquakes by noting the great and, at the same time, variable\r\nelasticity of rocks. In the extreme form this elasticity is very well\r\nshown when a toy marble, which is made of a close-textured rock, such\r\nas that from which it derives its name, is thrown upon a pavement\r\ncomposed of like dense material. Experiment will show that the little\r\nsphere can often be made to bounce to the height of twenty feet\r\nwithout breaking. If, then, with the same energy the marble is thrown\r\nupon a brick floor, the rebound will be very much diminished. It is\r\nwell to consider what happens to produce the rebound. When the sphere\r\nstrikes the floor it changes its shape, becoming shorter in the axis\r\nat right angles to the point which was struck, and at the same instant\r\nexpanded along the equator of that axis. The flattening remains for\r\nonly a small fraction of a second; the sphere vibrates so that it\r\nstretches along the line on which it previously shortened, and, as\r\nthis movement takes place with great swiftness, it may be said to\r\npropel itself away from the floor. At the same time a similar movement\r\ngoes on in the rock of the floor, and, where the rate of vibration is\r\nthe same, the two kicks are coincident, and so the sphere is impelled\r\nviolently away from the point of contact. Where the marble comes in\r\ncontact with brick, in part because of the lesser elasticity of that\r\nmaterial, due to its rather porous structure, and partly because it\r\ndoes not vibrate at the same rate as the marble, the expelling blow is\r\nmuch less strong.\r\n\r\nAll rocks whatever, even those which appear as incoherent sands, are\r\nmore or less set into vibratory motion whenever they are struck by a\r\nblow. In the crust of the earth various accidents occur which may\r\nproduce that sudden motion which we term a blow. When we have examined\r\ninto the origin of these impulses, and the way in which they are\r\ntransmitted through the rocks, we obtain a basis for understanding\r\nearthquake shocks. The commonest cause of the jarrings in the earth is\r\nfound in the formation of fractures, known as faults. If the reader\r\nhas ever been upon a frozen lake at a time when the weather was\r\ngrowing colder, and the ice, therefore, was shrinking, he may have\r\nnoted the rending sound and the slight vibration which comes with the\r\nformation of a crack traversing the sheet of ice. At such a time he\r\nfeels a movement which is an earthquake, and which represents the\r\nsimpler form of those tremors arising from the sudden rupture of fault\r\nplanes. If he has a mind to make the experiment, he may hang a bullet\r\nby a thread from a small frame which rests upon the ice, and note that\r\nas the vibration occurs the little pendulum sways to and fro, thus\r\nindicating the oscillations of the ice. The same instrument will move\r\nin an identical manner when affected by a quaking in the rocks.\r\n\r\nWhere the rocks are set in vibration by a rent which is formed in\r\nthem, the phenomena are more complicated, and often on a vastly larger\r\nscale than in the simple conditions afforded by a sheet of ice. The\r\nrocks on either side of the rupture generally slide over each other,\r\nand the opposing masses are rent in their friction upon one another;\r\nthe result is, not only the first jar formed by the initial fracture,\r\nbut a great many successive movements from the other breakages which\r\noccur. Again, in the deeper parts of the crust, the fault fissures are\r\noften at the moment of their formation filled by a violent inrush of\r\nliquid rock. This, as it swiftly moves along, tears away masses from\r\nthe walls, and when it strikes the end of the opening delivers a blow\r\nwhich may be of great violence. The nature of this stroke may be\r\njudged by the familiar instance where the relatively slow-flowing\r\nstream from a hydrant pipe is suddenly choked by closing the stopcock.\r\nUnless the plumber provides a cushion of air to diminish the energy of\r\nthe blow, it is often strong enough to shake the house. Again, when\r\nsteam or other gases are by a sudden diminution of pressure enabled to\r\nexpand, they may deliver a blow which is exactly like that caused by\r\nthe explosion of gunpowder, which, even when it rushes against the\r\nsoft cushion of the air, may cause a jarring that may be felt as well\r\nas heard to a great distance. Such movements very frequently occur in\r\nthe eruptions of volcanoes; they cause a quivering of the earth, which\r\nmay be felt for a great distance from the immediate seat of the\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nWhen by any of the sudden movements which have been above described a\r\njar is applied to the rocks, the wave flies through the more or less\r\nelastic mass until the energy involved in it is exhausted. This may\r\nnot be brought about until the motion has travelled for the distance\r\nof hundreds of miles. In the great earthquake of 1755, known as the\r\nLisbon shock, the records make it seem probable that the movement was\r\nfelt over one eighth part of the earth's surface. Such great\r\ndisturbances probably bring about a motion of the rocks near the point\r\nof origin, which may be expressed in oscillations having an amplitude\r\nof one to two feet; but in the greater number of earthquakes the\r\nmaximum swing probably does not exceed the tenth of that amount. Very\r\nsensible shaking, even such as may produce considerable damage to\r\nbuildings, are caused by shocks in which the earth vibrates with less\r\nthan an inch of swing.\r\n\r\nWhen a shock originates, the wave in the rocks due to the compression\r\nwhich the blow inflicts runs at a speed varying with the elasticity of\r\nthe substance, but at the rate of about fifteen hundred feet a second.\r\nThe movements of this wave are at right angles to the seat of the\r\noriginating disturbance, so that the shock may come to the surface in\r\na line forming any angle between the vertical and the nearly\r\nhorizontal. Where, as in a volcanic eruption, the shock originates\r\nwith an explosion, these waves go off in circles. Where, however, as\r\nis generally the case, the shock originates in a fault plane, which\r\nmay have a length and depth of many miles, the movement has an\r\nelliptical form.\r\n\r\nIf the earthquake wave ran through a uniform and highly elastic\r\nsubstance, such as glass, it would move everywhere with equal speed,\r\nand, in the case of the greater disturbances, the motion might be felt\r\nover the whole surface of the earth. But as the motion takes place\r\nthrough rocks of varying elasticity, the rate at which it journeys is\r\nvery irregular. Moving through materials of one density, and with a\r\nrate of vibration determined by those conditions, the impulse is with\r\ndifficulty communicated to strata which naturally vibrate at another\r\nspeed. In many cases, as where a shock passing through dense\r\ncrystalline strata encounters a mass of soft sandstone, the wave, in\r\nplace of going on, is reflected back toward its point of origin. These\r\nearthquake echoes sometimes give rise to very destructive movements.\r\nIt often happens that before the original tremors of a shock have\r\npassed away from a point on the surface the reflex movements rush in,\r\nmaking a very irregular motion, which may be compared to that of the\r\nwaves in a cross-sea.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of earthquake action will serve to prepare the\r\nreader for an understanding of those very curious and important\r\neffects which these accidents produce in and on the earth. Below the\r\nsurface the sensible action of earthquake shocks is limited. It has\r\noften been observed that people in mines hardly note a swaying which\r\nmay be very conspicuous to those on the surface, the reason for this\r\nbeing that underground, where the rocks are firmly bound together, all\r\nthose swingings which are due to the unsupported position of such\r\nobjects as buildings, columnar rocks, trees, and the waters of the\r\nearth, are absent. The effect of the movements which earthquakes\r\nimpress on the under earth is mainly due to the fact that in almost\r\nevery part of the crust tensions or strains of other kinds are\r\ncontinually forming. These may for ages prove without effect until the\r\nearth is jarred, when motions will suddenly take place which in a\r\nmoment may alter the conditions of the rocks throughout a wide field.\r\nIn a word, a great earthquake caused by the formation of an extensive\r\nfault is likely to produce any number of slight dislocations, each of\r\nwhich is in turn shock-making, sending its little wave to complicate\r\nthe great oscillation. Nor does the perturbing effect of these jarring\r\nmovements cease with the fractures which they set up and the new\r\nstrains which are in turn developed by the motions which they induce.\r\nThe alterations of the rocks which are involved in chemical changes\r\nare favoured by such motions. It is a familiar experience that a\r\nvessel of water, if kept in the state of repose, may have its\r\ntemperature lowered three or four degrees below the freezing point\r\nwithout becoming frozen. If the side of the vessel is then tapped with\r\nthe finger, so as to send a slight quake through the mass, it will\r\ninstantly congeal. Molecular rearrangements are thus favoured by\r\nshocks, and the consequences of those which run through the earth are,\r\nfrom a chemical point of view, probably important.\r\n\r\nThe reader may help himself to understand something of the complicated\r\nproblem of earth tensions, and the corresponding movements of the\r\nrocks, by considering certain homely illustrations. He may observe how\r\nthe soil cracks as it shrinks in times of drought, the openings\r\nclosing when it rains. In a similar way the frozen earth breaks open,\r\nsometimes with a shock which is often counted as an earthquake. Again,\r\nthe ashes in a sifter or the gravel on a sieve show how each shaking\r\nmay relieve certain tensions established by gravity, while they create\r\nothers which are in turn to be released by the next shock. An ordinary\r\ndwelling house sways and strains with the alternations of temperature\r\nand moisture to which it is subjected in the round of climatal\r\nalterations. Now and then we note the movements in a cracking sound,\r\nbut by far the greater part of them escape observation.\r\n\r\nWith this sketch of the mechanism of earthquake shocks we now turn to\r\nconsider their effects upon the surface of the earth. From a\r\ngeological point of view, the most important effect of earthquake\r\nshocks is found in the movement of rock masses down steep slopes,\r\nwhich is induced by the shaking. Everywhere on the land the agents of\r\ndecay and erosion tend to bring heavy masses into position where\r\ngravitation naturally leads to their downfall, but where they may\r\nremain long suspended, provided they are not disturbed. Thus, wherever\r\nthere are high and steep cliffs, great falls of rock are likely to\r\noccur when the earthquake movements traverse the under earth. In more\r\nthan one instance observers, so placed that they commanded a view of\r\ndistant mountains, have noticed the downfall of precipices in the path\r\nof the shock before the trembling affected the ground on which they\r\nstood. In the famous earthquake of 1783, which devastated southern\r\nItaly, the Prince of Scylla persuaded his people to take refuge in\r\ntheir boats, hoping that they might thereby escape the destruction\r\nwhich threatened them on the land. No sooner were the unhappy folk on\r\nthe water than the fall of neighbouring cliffs near the sea produced a\r\ngreat wave, which overwhelmed the vessels.\r\n\r\nWhere the soil lies upon steep slopes, in positions in which it has\r\naccumulated during ages of tranquillity, a great shock is likely to\r\nsend it down into the valleys in vast landslides. Thus, in the\r\nearthquake of 1692, the Blue Mountains of Jamaica were so violently\r\nshaken that the soil and the forests which stood on it were\r\nprecipitated into the river beds, so that many tree-clad summits\r\nbecame fields of bare rock. The effect of this action is immensely to\r\nincrease the amount of detritus which the streams convey to the sea.\r\nAfter the great Jamaica shock, above noted, the rivers for a while\r\nceased to flow, their waters being stored in the masses of loose\r\nmaterial. Then for weeks they poured forth torrents of mud and the\r\n_débris_ of vegetation--materials which had to be swept away as the\r\nstreams formed new channels.\r\n\r\nIn all regions where earthquake movements are frequent, and the shock\r\nof considerable violence, the trained observer notes that the surfaces\r\nof bare rock are singularly extensive, the fact being that many of\r\nthese areas, where the slope lies at angles of from ten to thirty\r\ndegrees, which in an unshaken region would be thickly soil-covered,\r\nare deprived of the coating by the downward movement of the waste\r\nwhich the disturbances bring about. A familiar example of this action\r\nmay be had by watching the workmen engaged in sifting sand, by casting\r\nthe material on a sloping grating. The work could not be done but for\r\nan occasional blow applied to the sifter. An arrangement for such a\r\njarring motion is commonly found in various ore-dressing machines,\r\nwhere the object is to move fragments of matter over a sloping\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nEven where the earth is so level that an earthquake shock does not\r\ncause a sliding motion of the materials, such as above described,\r\nother consequences of the shaking may readily be noted. As the motion\r\nruns through the mass, provided the movement be one of considerable\r\nviolence, crevices several feet in width, and sometimes having the\r\nlength of miles, are often formed. In most cases these fissures,\r\nopened by one pulsation of the shock, are likely to be closed by the\r\nreturn movement, which occurs the instant thereafter. The consequences\r\nof this action are often singular, and in cases constitute the most\r\nfrightful elements of a shock which the sufferer beholds. In the great\r\nearthquake of 1811, which ravaged the section of the Mississippi\r\nValley between the mouth of the Ohio and Vicksburg, these crevices\r\nwere so numerously formed that the pioneers protected themselves from\r\nthe danger of being caught in their jaws by felling trees so that they\r\nlay at right angles to the direction in which the rents extended,\r\nbuilding on these timbers platforms to support their temporary\r\ndwelling places. The records of earthquakes supply many instances in\r\nwhich people have been caught in these earth fissures, and in a single\r\ncase it is recorded that a man who disappeared into the cavity was in\r\na moment cast forth in the rush of waters which in this, as in many\r\nother cases, spouts forth as the walls of the opening come together.\r\n\r\nSometimes these rents are attended by a dislocation, which brings the\r\nearth on one side much higher than on the other. The step thus\r\nproduced may be many miles in length, and may have a height of twenty\r\nfeet or more. It needs no argument to show that we have here the top\r\nof a fault such as produced the shock, or it may be one of a secondary\r\nnature, such as any earthquake is likely to bring about in the strata\r\nwhich it traverses. In certain cases two faults conjoin their action,\r\nso that a portion of the surface disappears beneath the earth,\r\nentombing whatever may have stood on the vanished site. Thus in the\r\ngreat shock known as that of Lisbon, which occurred in 1755, the stone\r\nquay along the harbour, where many thousand people had sought refuge\r\nfrom the falling buildings of the city, suddenly sank down with the\r\nmultitude, and the waters closed over it; no trace of the people or of\r\nthe structure was to be found after the shock was over. There is a\r\nstory to the effect that during the same earthquake an Arab village in\r\nnorthern Africa sank down, the earth on either side closing over it,\r\nso that no trace of the habitations remained. In both these instances\r\nthe catastrophes are best explained by the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Diagram showing how a portion of the earth's\r\nsurface may be sunk by faulting. Fig. A shows the original position;\r\nB, the position after faulting; b b' and c c' the planes of the\r\nfaults; the arrows the direction of the movement.]\r\n\r\nIn the earthquake of 1811 the alluvial plains on either side of the\r\nMississippi at many points sank down so that arable land was converted\r\ninto lakes; the area of these depressions probably amounted to some\r\nhundred square miles. The writer, on examining these sunken lands,\r\nfound that the subsidences had occurred where the old moats or\r\nabandoned channels of the great river had been filled in with a\r\nmixture of decaying timber and river silt. When violently shaken, this\r\nloose-textured _débris_ naturally settled down, so that it formed a\r\nbasin occupied by a crescent-shaped lake. The same process of settling\r\nplentifully goes on wherever the rocks are still in an uncemented\r\nstate. The result is often the production of changes which lead to the\r\nexpulsion of gases. Thus, in the Charleston earthquake of 1883, the\r\nsurface over an area of many hundred square miles was pitted with\r\nsmall craters, formed by the uprush of water impelled by its contained\r\ngases. These little water volcanoes--for such we may call\r\nthem--sometimes occur to the number of a dozen or more on each acre of\r\nground in the violently shaken district. They indicate one result of\r\nthe physical and chemical alterations which earthquake shocks bring\r\nabout. As earthquakes increase in violence their effect upon the soil\r\nbecomes continually greater, until in the most violent shocks all the\r\nloose materials on the surface of the earth may be so shaken about as\r\nto destroy even the boundaries of fields. After the famous earthquake\r\nof Riobamba, which occurred on the west coast of South America in\r\n1797, the people of the district in which the town of that name was\r\nsituated were forced to redivide their land, the original boundaries\r\nhaving disappeared. Fortunately, shocks of this description are\r\nexceedingly rare. They occur in only a few parts of the world.\r\n\r\nCertain effects of earthquakes where the shock emerges beneath the sea\r\nhave been stated in the account of volcanic eruptions (see page 299).\r\nWe may therefore note here only certain of the more general facts.\r\nWhile passing through the deep seas, this wave may have a height of\r\nnot more than two or three feet and a width of some score miles. As it\r\nrolls in upon the shore the front of the undulation is retarded by the\r\nfriction of the bottom in such a measure that its speed is diminished,\r\nwhile the following part of the waves, being less checked, crowds up\r\ntoward this forward part. The result is, that the surge mounts ever\r\nhigher and higher as it draws near the shore, upon which it may roll\r\nas a vast wave having the height of fifty feet or more and a width\r\nquite unparalleled by any wave produced from wind action. Waves of\r\nthis description are most common in the Pacific Ocean. Although but\r\noccasional, the damage which they may inflict is very great. As the\r\nmovement approaches the shore, vessels, however well anchored, are\r\ndragged away to seaward by the great back lash of the wave, a\r\nphenomenon which may be perceived even in the case of the ordinary\r\nsurf. Thus forced to seaward, the crews of the ships may find their\r\nvessels drawn out for the distance of some miles, until they come near\r\nthe face of the advancing billow. This, as it approaches the shore,\r\nstraightens up to the wall-fronted form, and then topples upon the\r\nland. Those vessels which are not at once crushed down by the blow are\r\ngenerally hurled far inland by the rush of waters. In the great\r\nJamaica earthquake of 1692 a British man-of-war was borne over the\r\ntops of certain warehouses and deposited at a distance from the shore.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that water is a highly elastic material, the shocks\r\ntransmitted to it from the bottom are sent onward with their energy\r\nbut little diminished. While the impulse is very violent, these\r\noscillations may prove damaging to shipping. The log-books of mariners\r\nabound in stories of how vessels were dismasted or otherwise badly\r\nshaken by a sudden blow received in the midst of a quiet sea. The\r\nimpression commonly conveyed to the sailors is that the craft has\r\nstruck upon a rock. The explanation is that an earthquake jar, in\r\ntraversing the water, has delivered its blow to the ship. As the speed\r\nof this jarring movement is very much greater than that of any\r\nordinary wave, the blow which it may strike may be most destructive.\r\nThere seems, indeed, little reason to doubt that a portion of the\r\nvessels which are ever disappearing in the wilderness of the ocean are\r\nlost by the crushing effect of these quakings which pass through the\r\nwaters of the deep.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the earthquake shock as an oscillation. It\r\nis a quality of all bodies which oscillate under the influence of a\r\nblow, such as originates in earthquake shocks, to swing to and fro,\r\nafter the manner of the metal in a bell or a tuning fork, in a\r\nsuccession of movements, each less than the preceding, until the\r\nimpulse is worn out, or rather, we should in strict sense say,\r\nchanged to other forms of energy. The result is, that even in the\r\nslightest earthquake shock the earth moves not once to and fro, but\r\nvery many times. In a considerable shock the successive diminishing\r\nswingings amount to dozens before they become so slight as to elude\r\nperception. Although the first swaying is the strongest, and generally\r\nthe most destructive, the quick to-and-fro motions are apt to continue\r\nand to complete the devastation which the first brings about. The\r\nvibrations due to any one shock take place with great rapidity. They\r\nmay, indeed, be compared to those movements which we perceive in the\r\nmargin of a large bell when it has received a heavy blow from the\r\nclapper. The reader has perhaps seen that for a moment the rim of the\r\nbell vibrates with such rapidity that it has a misty look--that is,\r\nthe motions elude the sight. It is easy to see that a shaking of this\r\nkind is particularly calculated to disrupt any bodies which stand free\r\nin the air and are supported only at their base.\r\n\r\nIn what we may call the natural architecture of the earth, the\r\npinnacles and obelisks, such as are formed in many high countries, the\r\neffect of these shakings is destructive, and, as we have seen, even\r\nthe firmer-placed objects, such as the strong-walled cliffs and steep\r\nslopes of earth, break down under the assaults. It is therefore no\r\nmatter of surprise that the buildings which man erects, where they are\r\ncomposed of masonry, suffer greatly from these tremblings. In almost\r\nall cases human edifices are constructed without regard to other\r\nproblems of strength than those which may be measured by their weight\r\nand the resistance to fracture from gravitation alone. They are not\r\nbuilt with expectation of a quaking, but of a firm-set earth.\r\n\r\nThe damage which earthquakes do to buildings is in most cases due to\r\nthe fact that they sway their walls out of plumb, so that they are no\r\nlonger in position to support the weight which they have to bear. The\r\namount of this swaying is naturally very much greater than that which\r\nthe earth itself experiences in the movement. A building of any height\r\nwith its walls unsupported by neighbouring structures may find its\r\nroof rocked to and fro through an arc which has a length of feet,\r\nwhile its base moves only through a length of inches. The reader may\r\nsee an example of this nature if he will poise a thin book or a bit of\r\nplank a foot long on top of a small table; then jarring the table so\r\nthat it swings through a distance of say a quarter of an inch, he will\r\nsee that the columnar object swings at its top through a much greater\r\ndistance, and is pretty sure to be overturned.\r\n\r\nWhere a building carries a load in its upper parts, such as may be\r\nafforded by its heavy roof or the stores which it contains, the effect\r\nof an earthquake shock such as carries the earth to and fro becomes\r\nmuch more destructive than it might otherwise be. This weight lags\r\nbehind when the earth slips forward in the first movement of the\r\noscillation, with the effect that the walls of the building are pretty\r\nsure to be thrust so far beyond the perpendicular that they give way\r\nand are carried down by the weight which they bore. It has often been\r\nremarked in earthquake shocks that tall columns, even where composed\r\nof many blocks, survive a shock which overturns lower buildings where\r\nthin walls support several floors, on each of which is accumulated a\r\nconsiderable amount of weight. In the case of the column, the strains\r\nare even, and the whole structure may rock to and fro without toppling\r\nover. As the energy of the undulations diminish, it gradually regains\r\nthe quiet state without damage. In the ordinary edifice the irregular\r\ndisposition of the weight does not permit the uniform movement which\r\nmay insure safety. Thus, if the city of Washington should ever be\r\nviolently shaken, the great obelisk, notwithstanding that it is five\r\nhundred feet high, may survive a disturbance which would wreck the\r\nlower and more massive edifices which lie about it.\r\n\r\nWhere, as is fortunately rarely the case, the great shock comes to\r\nthe earth in a vertical direction, the effect upon all movable objects\r\nis in the highest measure disastrous. In such a case buildings are\r\ncrushed as if by the stroke of a giant's hand. The roofs and floors\r\nare at one stroke thrown to the foundations, and all the parts of the\r\nwalls which are not supported by strong masonry continuous from top to\r\nbottom are broken to pieces. In such cases it has been remarked that\r\nthe bodies of men are often thrown considerable distances. It is\r\nasserted, indeed, that in the Riobamba shock they were cast upward to\r\nthe height of more than ninety feet. It is related that the solo\r\nsurvivor of a congregation which had hastened at the outset of the\r\ndisturbance into a church was thrown by the greatest and most\r\ndestructive shock upward and through a window the base of which was at\r\nthe height of more than twenty feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is readily understood that an earthquake shock may enter a building\r\nin any direction between the vertical and the horizontal. As the\r\nmovement exhausts itself in passing from the place of its origin, the\r\nhorizontal shocks are usually of least energy. Those which are\r\naccurately vertical are only experienced where the edifices are placed\r\nimmediately over the point where the motion originates. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that the destructive work of earthquakes is mainly\r\nperformed in that part of the field where the motion is, as regards\r\nits direction, between the vertical and the horizontal--a position in\r\nwhich the edifice is likely to receive at once the destructive effect\r\narising from the sharp upward thrust of the vertical movement and the\r\noscillating action of that which is in a horizontal direction. Against\r\nstrains of this description, where the movements have an amplitude of\r\nmore than a few inches, no ordinary masonry edifice can be made\r\nperfectly safe; the only tolerable security is attained where the\r\nbuilding is of well-framed timber, which by its elasticity permits a\r\ngood deal of motion without destructive consequences. Even such\r\nbuildings, however, those of the strongest type, may be ruined by the\r\ngreater earthquakes. Thus, in the Mississippi Valley earthquake of\r\n1811, the log huts of the frontiersmen, which are about as strong as\r\nany buildings can be made, were shaken to pieces by the sharp and\r\nreiterated shocks.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means surprising to find that the style of architecture\r\nadopted in earthquake countries differs from that which is developed\r\nin regions where the earth is firm-set. The people generally learn\r\nthat where their buildings must meet the trials of earthquakes they\r\nhave to be low and strong, framed in the manner of fortifications, to\r\nwithstand the assault of this enemy. We observe that Gothic\r\narchitecture, where a great weight of masonry is carried upon slender\r\ncolumns and walls divided by tall windows, though it became the\r\ndominant style in the relatively stable lands of northern Europe,\r\nnever gained a firm foothold in those regions about the Mediterranean\r\nwhich are frequently visited by severe convulsions of the earth. There\r\nthe Grecian or the Romanesque styles, which are of a much more massive\r\ntype, retain their places and are the fashions to the present day.\r\nEven this manner of building, though affording a certain security\r\nagainst slight tremblings, is not safe in the greater shocks. Again\r\nand again large areas in southern Italy have been almost swept of\r\ntheir buildings by the destructive movements which occur in that\r\nrealm. The only people who have systematically adapted their\r\narchitectural methods to earthquake strains are the Japanese, who in\r\ncertain districts where such risks are to be encountered construct\r\ntheir dwellings of wood, and place them upon rollers, so that they may\r\nreadily move to and fro as the shock passes beneath them. In a measure\r\nthe people of San Francisco have also provided against this danger by\r\navoiding dangerous weights in the upper parts of their buildings, as\r\nwell as the excessive height to which these structures are lifted in\r\nsome of our American towns.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes of sensible energy appear to be limited to particular\r\nparts of the earth's crust. The regions, indeed, where within the\r\nperiod of human history shocks of devastating energy have occurred do\r\nnot include more than one fifteenth part of the earth's surface. There\r\nis a common notion that these movements are most apt to happen in\r\nvolcanic regions. It is, indeed, true that sensible shocks commonly\r\nattend the explosions from great craters, but the records clearly show\r\nthat these movements are very rarely of destructive energy. Thus in\r\nthe regions about the base of Vesuvius and of Ætna, the two volcanoes\r\nof which most is known, the shocks have never been productive of\r\nextensive disaster. In fact, the reiterated slight jarrings which\r\nattend volcanic action appear to prevent the formation of those great\r\nand slowly accumulated strains which in their discharge produce the\r\nmost violent tremblings of the earth. The greatest and most continuous\r\nearthquake disturbances of history--that before noted in the early\r\ndays of this century, in the Mississippi Valley, where shocks of\r\nconsiderable violence continued for two years--came about in a field\r\nvery far removed from active volcanoes. So, too, the disturbances\r\nbeneath the Atlantic floor which originated the shocks that led to the\r\ndestruction of Lisbon, and many other similar though less violent\r\nmovements, are developed in a field apparently remote from living\r\nvolcanoes. Eastern New England, which has been the seat of several\r\nconsiderable earthquakes, is about as far away from active vents as\r\nany place on the habitable globe. We may therefore conclude that,\r\nwhile volcanoes necessarily produce shocks resulting from the\r\ndischarge of their gases and the intrusion of lava into the dikes\r\nwhich are formed about them, the greater part of the important shocks\r\nare in no wise connected with volcanic explosions.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the earthquake in the Mississippi Valley, all\r\nthe great shocks of which we have a record have occurred in or near\r\nregions where the rocks have been extensively disturbed by\r\nmountain-building forces, and where the indications lead us to\r\nbelieve that dislocations of strata, such as are competent to rive the\r\nbeds asunder, may still be in progress. This, taken in connection with\r\nthe fact that many of these shocks are attended by the formation of\r\nfault planes, which appear on the surface, lead us to the conclusion\r\nthat earthquakes of the stronger kind are generally formed by the\r\nriving of fissures, which may or may not be developed upward to the\r\nsurface. This view is supported by many careful observations on the\r\neffect which certain great earthquakes have exercised on the buildings\r\nwhich they have ravaged. The distinguished observer, Mr. Charles\r\nMallet, who visited the seat of the earthquake which, in 1854,\r\noccurred in the province of Calabria in Italy, with great labour and\r\nskill determined the direction in which the shock moved through some\r\nhundreds of edifices on which it left the marks of its passage.\r\nPlatting these lines of motion, he found that they were all referred\r\nto a vertical plane lying at the depth of some miles beneath the\r\nsurface, and extending for a great distance in a north and south\r\ndirection. This method of inquiry has been applied to other fields,\r\nwith the result that in the case of all the instances which have been\r\nsubjected to this inquiry the seat of the shock has been traced to\r\nsuch a plane, which can best be accounted for by the supposition of a\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThe method pursued by Mr. Mallet in his studies of the origin of\r\nearthquakes, and by those who have continued his inquiry, may be\r\nbriefly indicated as follows: Examining disrupted buildings, it is\r\neasy to determine those which have been wrecked by a shock that\r\nemerged from the earth in a vertical direction. In these cases, though\r\ntall walls may remain standing, the roofs and floors are thrown into\r\nthe cellars. With a dozen such instances the plane of what is called\r\nthe seismic vertical is established (_seismos_ is the Greek for\r\nearthquake). Then on either side of this plane, which indicates the\r\nline but not the depth of the disturbance, other observations may be\r\nmade which give the clew to the depth. Thus a building may be found\r\nwhere the northwest corner at its upper part has been thrown off. Such\r\na rupture was clearly caused by an upward but oblique movement, which\r\nin the first half of the oscillation heaved the structure upwardly\r\ninto the northwest, and then in the second half, or rebound, drew the\r\nmass of the building away from the unsupported corner, allowing that\r\npart of the masonry to fly off and fall to the ground. Constructing a\r\nline at right angles to the plane of the fracture, it will be found to\r\nintersect the plane, the position of which has been in part determined\r\nby finding the line where it intersects the earth, or the seismic\r\nvertical before noted. Multiplying such observations on either side of\r\nthe last-mentioned line, the attitude of the underground parts of the\r\nplane, as well as the depth to which it attained, can be approximately\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to consider the extent to which earthquake shocks\r\nmay affect the general quality of the people who dwell in countries\r\nwhere these disturbances occur with such frequency and violence as to\r\ninfluence their lives. There can be no question that wherever\r\nearthquakes occur in such a measure as to produce widespread terror,\r\nwhere, recurring from time to time, they develop in men a sense of\r\nabiding insecurity, they become potent agents of degradation. All the\r\nbest which men do in creating a civilization rests upon a sense of\r\nconfidence that their efforts may be accumulated from year to year,\r\nand that even after death the work of each man may remain as a\r\nheritage to his kind. It is likely, indeed, that in certain realms, as\r\nin southern Italy, a part of the failure of the people to advance in\r\nculture is due to their long experience of such calamities, and the\r\nnatural expectation that they will from time to time recur. In a\r\nsimilar way the Spanish settlements in Central and South America,\r\nwhich lie mostly in lands that are subject to disastrous shocks, may\r\nhave been retarded by the despair, as well as the loss of property\r\nand life, which these accidents have so frequently inflicted upon\r\nthem. It will not do, however, to attribute too much to such\r\nterrestrial influences. By far the most important element in\r\ndetermining the destiny of a people is to be found in their native\r\nquality, that which they owe to their ancestors of distant\r\ngenerations. In this connection it is well to consider the history of\r\nthe Icelandic people, where a small folk has for a thousand years been\r\nexposed to a range and severity of trials, such as earthquakes,\r\nvolcanic explosions, and dearth of harvests may produce, and all these\r\nin a measure that few if any other countries experience.\r\nNotwithstanding these misfortunes, the Icelanders have developed and\r\nmaintained a civilization which in all else, except its material\r\nresults, on the average transcends that which has been won by any\r\nother folk in modern times. If a people have the determining spirit\r\nwhich leads to high living, they can successfully face calamities far\r\ngreater than those which earthquakes inflict.\r\n\r\nIt was long supposed that the regions where earthquakes are not\r\nnoticeable by the unaided senses were exempt from all such\r\ndisturbances. The observations which seismologists have made in recent\r\nyears point to the conclusion that no part of the earth's surface is\r\nquite exempt from movements which, though not readily perceived, can\r\nbe made visible by the use of appropriate instruments. With an\r\napparatus known as the horizontal pendulum it is possible to observe\r\nvibrations which do not exceed in amplitude the hundredth part of an\r\ninch. This mechanism consists essentially of a slender bar supported\r\nnear one end by two wires, one from above, the other from below. It\r\nmay readily be conceived that any measurable movement will cause the\r\nlonger end of the rod to sway through a considerable arc. Wherever\r\nsuch a pendulum has been carefully observed in any district, it has\r\nbeen found that it indicates the occurrence of slight tremors. Even\r\ncertain changes of the barometer, which alter the weight of the\r\natmosphere that rests upon the earth to the amount indicated by an\r\ninch in the height of the mercury column, appears in all cases to\r\ncreate such tremors. Many of these slight shocks may be due to the\r\neffect of more violent quakings, which have run perhaps for thousands\r\nof miles from their point of origin, and have thus been reduced in the\r\namplitude of their movement. Others are probably due to the slight\r\nmotion brought about through the chemical changes of the rocks, which\r\nare continuously going on. The ease with which even small motions are\r\ncarried to a great distance may be judged by the fact that when the\r\nground is frozen the horizontal pendulum will indicate the jarring due\r\nto a railway train at the distance of a mile or more from the track.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the earth jarring, it would be well to note the\r\noccurrence of another, though physically different, kind of movement,\r\nwhich we may term earth swayings, or massive movements, which slowly\r\ndislocate the vertical, and doubtless also the horizontal, position of\r\npoints upon its surface. It has more than once been remarked that in\r\nmountain countries, where accurate sights have been taken, the heights\r\nof points between the extremities of a long line appear somewhat to\r\nvary in the course of a term of years. Thus at a place in the\r\nApennines, where two buildings separated by some miles of distance are\r\ncommonly intervisible over the crest of a neighbouring peak, it has\r\nhappened that a change of level of some one of the points has made it\r\nimpossible to see the one edifice from the other. Knowing as we do\r\nthat the line of the seacoast is ever-changing, uprising taking place\r\nat some points and down-sinking at others, it seems not unlikely that\r\nthese irregular swayings are of very common occurrence. Moreover,\r\nastronomers are beginning to remark the fact that their observatories\r\nappear not to remain permanently in the same position--that is, they\r\ndo not have exactly the same latitude and longitude. Certain of these\r\nchanges have recently been explained by the discovery of a new and\r\nhitherto unnoted movement of the polar axis. It is not improbable,\r\nhowever, that the irregular swaying of the earth's crust, due to the\r\nfolding of strata and to the alterations in the volume of rocks which\r\nare continually going on, may have some share in bringing about these\r\ndislocations.\r\n\r\nMeasured by the destruction which was wrought to the interests of man,\r\nearthquakes deserve to be reckoned among the direst calamities of\r\nNature. Since the dawn of history the records show us that the\r\ndestruction of life which is to be attributed to them is to be counted\r\nby the millions. A catalogue of the loss of life in the accidents of\r\nthis description which have occurred during the Christian era has led\r\nthe writer to suppose that probably over two million persons have\r\nperished from these shocks in the last nineteen centuries.\r\nNevertheless, as compared with other agents of destruction, such as\r\npreventable disease, war, or famine, the loss which has been inflicted\r\nby earth movements is really trifling, and almost all of it is due to\r\nan obstinate carelessness in the construction of buildings without\r\nreference to the risks which are known to exist in earthquake-ridden\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAlthough all our exact knowledge concerning the distribution of\r\nearthquakes is limited to the imperfect records of two or three\r\nthousand years, it is commonly possible to measure in a general way\r\nthe liability to such accidents which may exist in any country by a\r\ncareful study of the details of its topography. In almost every large\r\narea the process of erosion naturally leaves quantities of rock,\r\neither in the form of detached columns or as detrital accumulations\r\ndeposited on steep slopes. These features are of relatively slow\r\nformation, and it is often possible to determine that they have been\r\nin their positions for a time which is to be measured by thousands of\r\nyears. Thus, on inspecting a country such as North America, where the\r\nhistoric records cover but a brief time, we may on inquiry determine\r\nwhich portions of its area have long been exempt from powerful shocks.\r\nWhere natural obelisks and steep taluses abound--features which would\r\nhave disappeared if the region had been moved by great shocks--we may\r\nbe sure that the field under inspection has for a great period been\r\nexempt from powerful shaking. Judged by this standard, we may safely\r\nsay that the region occupied by the Appalachian Mountains has been\r\nexempt from serious trouble. So, too, the section of the Cordilleras\r\nlying to the east of what is commonly called the Great Basin, between\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, has also enjoyed a long\r\nreign of peace. In glaciated countries the record is naturally less\r\nclear than in those parts of the world which have been subjected to\r\nlong-continued, slow decay of the rocks. Nevertheless, in those fields\r\nboulders are often found poised in position which they could not have\r\nmaintained if subjected to violent shaking. Judged by this evidence,\r\nwe may say that a large part of the northern section of this\r\ncontinent, particularly the area about the Great Lakes, has been\r\nexempt from considerable shocks since the glacier passed away.\r\n\r\nThe shores which are subject to the visitations of the great marine\r\nwaves, caused by earthquake shocks occurring beneath the bottom of the\r\nneighbouring ocean, are so swept by those violent inundations that\r\nthey lose many features which are often found along coasts that have\r\nbeen exempted from such visitations. Thus wherever we find extensive\r\nand delicately moulded dunes, poised stones, or slender pinnacled\r\nrocks along a coast, we may be sure that since these features were\r\nformed the district has not been swept by these great waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Poised rocks indicating a long exemption from\r\nstrong earthquakes in the places where such features occur.]\r\n\r\nAround the northern Atlantic we almost everywhere find the glacial\r\nwaste here and there accumulated near the margin of the sea in the\r\ncomplicated sculptured outlines which are assumed by kame sands and\r\ngravels. From a study of these features just above the level of high\r\ntide, the writer has become convinced that the North Atlantic district\r\nhas long been exempt from the assaults of other waves than those which\r\nare produced during heavy storms. At the present time the waves\r\nformed by earthquakes appear to be of destructive violence only on the\r\nwest coast of South America, where they roll in from a region of the\r\nPacific lying to the south of the equator and a few hundred miles from\r\nthe shore of the continent, which appears to be the seat of\r\nexceedingly violent shocks. A similar field occurs in the Atlantic\r\nbetween the Lesser Antilles and the Spanish peninsula, but no great\r\nwaves have come thence since the time of the Lisbon earthquake. The\r\nbasin of the Caribbean and the region about Java appear to be also\r\nfields where these disturbances may be expected, though in each but\r\none wave of this nature has been recorded. Therefore we may regard\r\nthese secondary results of a submarine earthquake as seldom phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DURATION OF GEOLOGICAL TIME.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is beyond the power of man to conceive any such lapses of\r\ntime as have taken place in the history of this earth, it is\r\ninteresting, and in certain ways profitable, to determine as near as\r\npossible in the measure of years the duration of the events which are\r\nrecorded in the rocks. Some astronomers, basing their conclusions on\r\nthe heat-containing power of matter, and on the rate at which energy\r\nin this form flows from the sun, have come to the conclusion that our\r\nplanet could not have been in independent existence for more than\r\nabout twenty million years. The geologist, however, resting his\r\nconclusions on the records which are the subject of his inquiry, comes\r\non many different lines to an opinion which traverses that entertained\r\nby some distinguished astronomers. The ways in which the student of\r\nthe earth arrives at this opinion will now be set forth.\r\n\r\nBy noting the amount of sediment carried forth to the sea by the\r\nrivers, the geologist finds that the lands of the earth--those, at\r\nleast, which are protected by their natural envelopes of\r\nvegetation--are wearing down at a rate which pretty certainly does\r\nnot exceed one foot in about five thousand years, or two hundred feet\r\nin a million years. Discovering at many places on the earth's surface\r\ndeposits which originally had a thickness of five thousand feet or\r\nmore, which have been worn down to the depths of thousands of feet in\r\na single rather brief section of geological time, the student readily\r\nfinds himself prepared to claim that a period of from five to ten\r\nmillion years has often been required for the accomplishment of but a\r\nvery small part of the changes which he knows to have occurred on this\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAs the geologist follows down through the sections of the stratified\r\nrocks, and from the remains of strata determines the erosion which has\r\nborne away the greater part of the thick deposits which have been\r\nexposed to erosion, he comes upon one of those breaks in the\r\nsuccession, or encounters what is called an unconformity, as when\r\nhorizontal strata lie against those which are tilted. In many cases he\r\nmay observe that at this time there was a great interval unrepresented\r\nby deposits at the place where his observations are made, yet a great\r\nlapse of time is indicated by the fact that a large amount of erosion\r\ntook place in the interval between the two sets of beds.\r\n\r\nPutting together the bits of record, and assuming that the rate of\r\nerosion accomplished by the agents which operate on the land has\r\nalways been about the same, the geologist comes to the conclusion that\r\nthe section of the rocks from the present day to the lowest strata of\r\nthe Laurentian represents in the time required for their formation not\r\nless than a hundred million years; more likely twice that duration. To\r\nthis argument objection is made by some naturalists that the agents of\r\nerosion may have been more active in the past than they are at\r\npresent. They suggest that the rainfall may have been much greater or\r\nthe tides higher than they now are. Granting all that can be claimed\r\non this score, we note the fact that the rate of erosion evidently\r\ndoes not increase in anything like a proportionate way with the\r\namount of rainfall. Where a country is protected by its natural\r\ncoating of vegetation, the rain is delivered to the streams without\r\nmaking any considerable assault upon the surface of the earth, however\r\nlarge the fall may be. Moreover, the tides have little direct cutting\r\npower; they can only remove detritus which other agents have brought\r\ninto a condition to be borne away. The direct cutting power of the\r\ntidal movement does not seem to be much greater in the Bay of Fundy,\r\nwhere the maximum height of the waves amounts to fifty feet, than on\r\nthe southern coast of Massachusetts, where the range is not more than\r\nfive. So far as the observer can judge, the climatal conditions and\r\nthe other influences which affect the wear of rocks have not greatly\r\nvaried in the past from what they are at the present day. Now and then\r\nthere have been periods of excessive erosion; again, ages in which\r\nlarge fields were in the conditions of exceeding drought. It is,\r\nhowever, a fair presumption that these periods in a way balance each\r\nother, and that the average state was much like that which we find at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf after studying the erosive phenomena exhibited in the structure of\r\nthe earth the student takes up the study of the accumulations of\r\nstrata, and endeavours to determine the time required for the laying\r\ndown of the sediments, he finds similar evidence of the earth's great\r\nantiquity. Although the process of deposition, which has given us the\r\nrocks visible in the land masses, has been very much interrupted, the\r\nsection which is made by grouping the observations made in various\r\nfields shows that something like a maximum thickness of a hundred and\r\nfifty thousand feet of beds has been accumulated in that part of\r\ngeologic time during which strata were being laid down in the fields\r\nthat are subjected to our study. Although in these rocks there are\r\nmany sets of beds which were rapidly formed, the greater part of them\r\nhave been accumulated with exceeding slowness. Many fine shales, such\r\nas those which plentifully occur in the Devonian beds of this country,\r\nmust have required a thousand years or more for the deposition of the\r\nmaterials that now occupy an inch in depth. In those sections a single\r\nfoot of the rock may well represent a period of ten thousand years. In\r\nmany of the limestones the rate of accumulation could hardly have been\r\nmore speedy. The reckoning has to be rough, but the impression which\r\nsuch studies make upon the mind of the unprejudiced observer is to the\r\neffect that the thirty miles or so of sedimentary deposits could not\r\nhave been formed in less than a hundred million years. In this\r\nreckoning it should be noted that no account is taken of those great\r\nintervals of unrecorded time, such as elapsed between the close of the\r\nLaurentian and the beginning of the Cambrian periods.\r\n\r\nThere is a third way in which we may seek an interpretation of\r\nduration from the rocks. In each successive stage of the earth's\r\nhistory, in different measure in the various ages, mountains were\r\nformed which in time, during their exposure to the conditions of the\r\nland, were worn down to their roots and covered by deposits\r\naccumulated during the succeeding ages. A score or more of these\r\nsuccessively constructed series of elevations may readily be observed.\r\nOf old, it was believed that mountain ranges were suddenly formed, but\r\nthere is, however, ample evidence to prove that these disturbed\r\nportions of the strata were very gradually dislocated, the rate of the\r\nmountainous growth having been, in general, no greater in the past\r\nthan it is at the present day, when, as we know full well, the\r\nmovements are going on so slowly that they escape observation. Only\r\nhere and there, as an attendant on earthquake shocks or other related\r\nmovements of the crust, do we find any trace of the upward march which\r\nproduces these elevations. Although not a subject for exact\r\nmeasurements, these features of mountain growth indicate a vast lapse\r\nof time, during which the elevations were formed and worn away.\r\n\r\nYet another and very different method by which we may obtain some\r\ngauge of the depths of the past is to be found in the steps which have\r\nled organic life from its lowest and earliest known forms to the\r\npresent state of advancement. Taking the changes of species which have\r\noccurred since the beginning of the last ice epoch, we find that the\r\nchanges which have been made in the organic life have been very small;\r\nno naturalist who has obtained a clear idea of the facts will question\r\nthe statement that they are not a thousandth part of the alterations\r\nwhich have occurred since the Laurentian time. The writer is of the\r\nopinion that they do not represent the ten thousandth part of those\r\nvast changes. These changes are limited in the main to the\r\ndisappearance of a few forms, and to slight modifications in those\r\npreviously in existence which have survived to the present day. So far\r\nas we can judge, no considerable step in the organic series has taken\r\nplace in this last great period of the earth's history, although it\r\nhas been a period when, as before noted, all the conditions have\r\ncombined to induce rapid modifications in both animals and plants. If,\r\nthen, we can determine the duration of this period, we may obtain a\r\ngauge of some general value.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can not measure in any accurate way the duration of the\r\nevents which have taken place since the last Glacial period began to\r\nwane, a study of the facts seems to show that less than a hundred\r\nthousand years can not well be assumed for this interval. Some of the\r\nstudents who have approached the subject are disposed to allow a\r\nperiod of at least twice this length as necessary for the perspective\r\nwhich the train of events exhibits. Reckoning on the lowest estimate,\r\nand counting the organic changes which take place during the age as\r\namounting to the thousandth part of the organic changes since the\r\nLaurentian age, we find ourselves in face once again of that\r\ninconceivable sum which was indicated by the physical record.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the critics assert that there may have been periods in\r\nthe history of the earth when the changes of organic life occurred in\r\na far swifter manner than in this last section of the earth's history.\r\nThis supposition is inadmissible, for it rests on no kind of proof; it\r\nis, moreover, contraindicated by the evident fact that the advance in\r\nthe organic series has been more rapid in recent time than at any\r\nstage of the past. In a word, all the facts with which the geologist\r\ndeals are decidedly against the assumption that terrestrial changes in\r\nthe organic or the inorganic world ever proceed in a spasmodic manner.\r\nHere and there, and from time to time, local revolutions of a violent\r\nnature undoubtedly occur, but, so far as we may judge from the aspect\r\nof the present or the records of the past, these accidents are\r\nstrictly local; the earth has gone forward in its changes much as it\r\nis now advancing. Its revolutions have been those of order rather than\r\nthose of accident.\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the naturalist is to take Nature as he finds it. He\r\nmust avoid supposing any methods of action which are not clearly\r\nindicated in the facts that he observes. The history of his own and of\r\nall other sciences clearly shows that danger is always incurred where\r\nsuppositions as to peculiar methods of action are introduced into the\r\ninterpretation. It required many centuries of labour before the\r\nstudents of the earth came to adopt the principle of explaining the\r\nproblems with which they had to deal by the evidence that the earth\r\nsubmitted to them. Wherever they trusted to their imaginations for\r\nguidance, they fell into error. Those who endeavour to abbreviate our\r\nconception of geologic time by supposing that in the olden days the\r\norder of events was other than that we now behold are going counter to\r\nthe best traditions of the science.\r\n\r\nAlthough the aspect of the record of life since the beginning of the\r\nCambrian time indicates a period of at least a hundred million years,\r\nit must not be supposed that this is the limit of the time required\r\nfor the development of the organic series. All the important types of\r\nanimals were already in existence in that ancient period with the\r\nexception of the vertebrates, the remains of which have apparently now\r\nbeen traced down to near the Cambrian level. In other words, at the\r\nstage where we first find evidence of living beings the series to\r\nwhich they belong had already climbed very far above the level of\r\nlifeless matter. Few naturalists will question the statement that half\r\nthe work of organic advance had been accomplished at the beginning of\r\nthe Cambrian rocks. The writer is of the opinion that the development\r\nwhich took place before that age must have required a much longer\r\nperiod than has elapsed from that epoch to the present day. We thus\r\ncome to the conclusion that the measurement of duration afforded by\r\norganic life indicates a yet more lengthened claim of events, and\r\ndemands more time than appears to be required for the formation of the\r\nstratified rocks.\r\n\r\nThe index of duration afforded by the organic series is probably more\r\ntrustworthy than that which is found in the sedimentary strata, and\r\nthis for the reason that the records of those strata have been\r\nsubjected to numerous and immeasurable breaks, while the development\r\nof organic life has of necessity been perfectly continuous. The one\r\nrecord can at any point be broken without interrupting the sequences;\r\nthe other does not admit of any breaches in the continuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MOON.\r\n\r\nSet over against the earth--related to, yet contrasted with it in many\r\nways--the moon offers a most profitable object to the student of\r\ngeology. He should often turn to it for those lessons which will be\r\nbriefly noted.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of their mutual history the materials of earth and\r\nmoon doubtless formed one vaporous body which had been parted from the\r\nconcentrating mass of the sun in the manner noted in the sketch of\r\nthe history of the solar system. After the earth-moon body had\r\ngathered into a nebulous sphere, it is most likely that a ring\r\nresembling that still existing about Saturn was formed about the\r\nearth, which in time consolidated into the satellite. Thenceforth the\r\ntwo bodies were parted, except for the gravitative attraction which\r\nimpelled them to revolve about their common centre of gravity, and\r\nexcept for the light and heat they might exchange with one another.\r\n\r\nThe first stages after the parting of the spheres of earth and moon\r\nappear to have been essentially the same in each body. Concentrating\r\nupon their centres, they became in time fluid by heat; further on,\r\nthey entered the rigid state--in a word, they froze--at least in their\r\nouter parts. At this point in their existence their histories utterly\r\ndiverge; or rather, we may say, the development of the earth continued\r\nin a vast unfolding, while that of the moon appears to have been\r\nabsolutely arrested in ways which we will now describe.\r\n\r\nWith the naked eye we see on the moon a considerable variation in the\r\nlight of different parts of its surface; we discern that the darker\r\npatches appear to be rudely circular, and that they run together on\r\ntheir margins. Seeing this little, the ancients fancied that our\r\nsatellite had seas and lands like the earth. The first telescopes did\r\nnot dispel their fancies; even down to the early part of this century\r\nthere were astronomers who believed the moon to be habitable; indeed,\r\nthey thought to find evidence that it was the dwelling place of\r\nintelligent beings who built cities, and who tried to signal their\r\nintellectual kindred of this planet. When, however, strong glasses\r\nwere applied to the exploration, these pleasing fancies were rudely\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nSeen with a telescope of the better sort, the moon reveals itself to\r\nbe in large part made up of circular depressions, each surrounded by a\r\nringlike wall, with nearly level but rough places between. The\r\nlargest of these walled areas is some four hundred miles in diameter;\r\nthence they grade down to the smallest pits which the glass can\r\ndisclose, which are probably not over as many feet across. The writer,\r\nfrom a careful study of these pits, has come to the conclusion that\r\nthe wider are the older and the smaller the last formed. The rude\r\nelevations about these pits--some of which rise to the height of ten\r\nthousand feet or more--constitute the principal topographic reliefs of\r\nthe lunar surface. Besides the pits above mentioned, there are\r\nnumerous fractures in the surface of the plains and ringlike ridges;\r\non the most of these the walls have separated, forming trenches not\r\nunlike what we find in the case of some terrestrial breaks such as\r\nhave been noted about volcanoes and elsewhere. It may be that the\r\nso-called canals of Mars are of the same nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Lunar mountains near the Gulf of Iris.]\r\n\r\nThe most curious feature on the moon's surface are the bands of\r\nlighter colour, which, radiating from certain of the volcanolike\r\npits--those of lesser size and probably of latest origin--extend in\r\nsome cases for five hundred miles or more across the surface. These\r\nlight bands have never been adequately explained. It seems most likely\r\nthat they are stains along the sides of cracks, such as are sometimes\r\nobserved about volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe eminent peculiarity of the moon is that it is destitute of any\r\nkind of gaseous or aqueous envelope. That there is no distinct\r\natmosphere is clearly shown by the perfectly sharp and sudden way in\r\nwhich the light of a star disappears when it goes behind the moon and\r\nthe clear lines of the edge of the satellite in a solar eclipse. The\r\nsame evidence shows that there is no vapour of water; moreover, a\r\ncareful search which the writer has made shows that the surface has\r\nnone of those continuous down grades which mark the work of water\r\nflowing over the land. Nearly all of the surface consists of shallow\r\nor deep pits, such as could not have been formed by water action. We\r\ntherefore have not only to conclude that the moon is waterless, but\r\nthat it has been in this condition ever since the part that is turned\r\ntoward us was shaped.\r\n\r\nAs the moon, except for the slight movement termed its \"libration,\"\r\nalways turns the same face to us, so that we see in all only about\r\nfour sevenths of its surface, it has naturally been conjectured that\r\nthe unseen side, which is probably some miles lower than that turned\r\ntoward us, might have a different character from that which we behold.\r\nThere are reasons why this is improbable. In the first place, we see\r\non the extreme border of the moon, when the libration turns one side\r\nthe farthest around toward the earth, the edge of a number of the\r\ngreat walled pits such as are so plenty on the visible area; it is\r\nfair to assume that these rings are completed in the invisible realm.\r\nOn this basis we can partly map about a third of the hidden side.\r\nFurthermore, there are certain bands of light which, though appearing\r\non the visible side, evidently converge to some points on the other.\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that, as all other bands radiate from\r\nwalled pits, these also start from such topographic features. In this\r\nway certain likenesses of the hidden area to that which is visible is\r\nestablished, thus making it probable that the whole surface of the\r\nsatellite has the same character.\r\n\r\nClearly as the greater part of the moon is revealed to us--so clearly,\r\nindeed, that it is possible to map any elevation of its surface that\r\nattains the height of five hundred feet--the interpretation of its\r\nfeatures in the light of geology is a matter of very great\r\ndifficulty. The main points seem to be tolerably clear; they are as\r\nfollows: The surface of the moon as we see it is that which was formed\r\nwhen that body, passing from the state of fluidity from heat, formed a\r\nsolid crust. The pits which we observe on its surface are the\r\ndepressions which were formed as the mass gradually ceased to boil.\r\nThe later formed of these openings are the smaller, as would be the\r\ncase in such a slowing down of a boiling process.\r\n\r\nAs the diameter of the moon is only about one fourth of that of the\r\nearth, its bulk is only about one sixteenth of that of its planet;\r\nconsequently, it must have cooled to the point of solidification ages\r\nbefore the larger sphere attained that state. It is probable that the\r\nsame changeless face that we see looked down for millions of years on\r\nan earth which was still a seething, fiery mass. In a word, all that\r\nvast history which is traceable in the rocks beneath our feet--which\r\nis in progress in the seas and lands and is to endure for an\r\ninconceivable time to come--has been denied our satellite, for the\r\nreason that it had no air with which to entrap the solar heat and no\r\nwater to apply the solar energy to evolutionary processes. The heat\r\nwhich comes upon the moon as large a share for each equal area as it\r\ncomes upon the earth flies at once away from the airless surface, at\r\nmost giving it a temporary warmth, but instituting no geological work\r\nunless it be a little movement from the expansion and contraction of\r\nthe rocks. During the ages in which the moon has remained thus\r\nlifeless the earth, owing to its air and water, has applied a vast\r\namount of solar energy to geological work in the development and\r\nredevelopment of its geological features and to the processes of\r\norganic life. We thus see the fundamental importance of the volatile\r\nenvelopes of our sphere, how absolutely they have determined its\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to consider the causes which led to the\r\nabsence of air and water on the moon, but this matter is one of the\r\nmost debatable of all that relates to that sphere; we shall therefore\r\nhave to content ourselves with the above brief statements as to the\r\nvast and far-acting effects which have arisen from the non-existence\r\nof those envelopes on our nearest neighbour of the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  METHODS IN STUDYING GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible the preceding pages, by the method adopted in the\r\npresentation of facts, will serve to show the student the ways in\r\nwhich he may best undertake to trace the order of events exhibited in\r\nthe phenomena of the earth. Following the plan pursued, we shall now\r\nconsider certain special points which need to be noted by those who\r\nwould adopt the methods of the geologist.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his studies it may be well for the inquirer to note\r\nthe fact that familiarity with the world about him leads the man in\r\nall cases to a certain neglect and contempt of all the familiar\r\npresentations of Nature. We inevitably forget that those points of\r\nlight in the firmament are vast suns, and we overlook the fact that\r\nthe soil beneath our feet is not mere dirt, but a marvellous\r\nstructure, more complicated in its processes than the chemist's\r\nlaboratory, from which the sustenance of our own and all other lives\r\nis drawn. We feel our own bodies as dear but commonplace possessions,\r\nthough we should understand them as inheritances from the\r\ninconceivable past, which have come to us through tens of thousands of\r\ndifferent species and hundreds of millions of individual ancestors. We\r\nmust overlook these things in our common life. If we could take them\r\ninto account, each soul would carry the universe as an intellectual\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, well from time to time to contemplate the truth, and\r\nto force ourselves to see that all this apparently simple and ordinary\r\nmedley of the world about us is a part of a vast procession of events,\r\ncoming forth from the darkness of the past and moving on beyond the\r\nlight of the present day. Even in his professional work the\r\nnaturalist of necessity falls into the commonplace way of regarding\r\nthe facts with which he deals. If he be an astronomer, he catalogues\r\nthe stars with little more sense of the immensities than the man who\r\nkeeps a shop takes account of his wares. Nevertheless, the real profit\r\nof all learning is in the largeness of the understanding which it\r\ndevelops in man. The periods of growth in knowledge are those in which\r\nthe mind, enriched by its store, enlarges its conception while it\r\nescapes from commonplace ways of thought. With this brief mention of\r\nwhat is by far the most important principle of guidance which the\r\nstudent can follow, we will turn to the questions of method that the\r\nstudent need follow in his ordinary work.\r\n\r\nWith almost all students a difficulty is encountered which hinders\r\nthem in acquiring any large views as to the world about them. This is\r\ndue to the fact that they can not make and retain in memory clear\r\npictures of the things they see. They remember words rather than\r\nthings--in fact, the training in language, which is so large a part of\r\nan education, tends ever to diminish the element of visual memory. The\r\nfirst task of the student who would become a naturalist is to take his\r\nknowledge from the thing, and to remember it by the mental picture of\r\nthe thing. In all education in Nature, whether the student is guided\r\nby his own understanding or that of the teacher, a first and very\r\ncontinuous aim should be to enforce the habit of recalling very\r\ndistinct images of all objects which it is desired to remember. To\r\nthis end the student should practise himself by looking intently upon\r\na landscape or any other object; then, turning away, he should try to\r\nrecall what he has beheld. After a moment the impression by the sight\r\nshould be repeated, and the study of the memory renewed. The writer\r\nknows by his own experience that even in middle-aged people, where it\r\nis hard to breed new habits, such deliberate training can greatly\r\nincrease the capacity of the memory for taking in and reproducing\r\nimages which are deemed of importance. Practice of this kind should\r\nform a part of every naturalist's daily routine. After a certain time,\r\nit need not be consciously done. The movements of thought and action\r\nwill, indeed, become as automatic as those which the trained fencer\r\nmakes with his foil.\r\n\r\nAlong with the habit of visualizing memories, and of storing them\r\nwithout the use of words, the student should undertake to enlarge his\r\npowers of conceiving spaces and directions as they exist in the field\r\nabout him. Among savages and animals below the grade of man, this\r\nunderstanding of spacial relations is very clear and strong. It\r\nenables the primitive man to find his way through the trackless\r\nforest, and the carrier pigeon to recover his mate and dwelling place\r\nfrom the distance of hundreds of miles away. In civilized men,\r\nhowever, the habit of the home and street and the disuse of the\r\nancient freedom has dulled, and in some instances almost destroyed,\r\nall sense of this shape of the external world. The best training to\r\nrecover this precious capacity will now be set forth.\r\n\r\nThe student should begin by drawing a map on a true scale, however\r\nroughly the work may be done, of those features of the earth about him\r\nwith which he is necessarily most familiar. The task may well be begun\r\nwith his own dwelling or his schoolroom. Thence it may be extended so\r\nas to include the plan of the neighbouring streets or fields. At\r\nfirst, only directions and distances should be platted. After a time\r\nto these indications should be added on the map lines indicating in a\r\ngeneral way contours or the lines formed by horizontal planes\r\nintersecting the area subject to delineation. After attaining certain\r\nrude skill in such work, the student may advantageously make\r\nexcursions to districts which he can see only in a hurried way. As he\r\ngoes, he should endeavour to note on a sketch map the positions of the\r\nhills and streams and the directions of the roads. A year of holiday\r\npractice in such work will, if the tasks occupy somewhere about a\r\nhundred hours of his time, serve greatly to extend or reawaken what\r\nmay be called the topographic sense, and enable him to place in terms\r\nof space the observations of Nature which he may make.\r\n\r\nIn his more detailed work the student should select some particular\r\nfield for his inquiry. If he be specially interested in geologic\r\nphenomena, he will best begin by noting two classes of facts--those\r\nexhibited in the rocks as they actually appear in the state of repose\r\nas shown in the outcrops of his neighbourhood, and those shown in the\r\nactive manifestations of geological work, the decay of the rocks and\r\nthe transportation of their waste, or, if the conditions favour, the\r\ncomplicated phenomena of the seashores.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the student begins to observe, he should begin to make a\r\nrecord of his studies. To the novice in any science written, and\r\nparticularly sketched, notes are of the utmost importance. These,\r\nwhether in words or in drawings, should be made in face of the facts;\r\nthey should, indeed, be set down at the close of an observation,\r\nthough not until the observer feels that the object he is studying has\r\nyielded to him all which it can at that time give. It is well to\r\nremark that where a record is made at the outset of a study the\r\nstudent is apt to feel that he is in some way pledged to shape all he\r\nmay see to fit that which he has first written. In his early\r\nexperience as a teacher, the writer was accustomed to have students\r\ncompare their work of observation and delineation with that done by\r\ntrained men on the same ground. It now seems to him best for the\r\nbeginner at first to avoid all such reference of his own work to that\r\nof others. So great is the need of developing independent motive that\r\nit is better at the outset to make many blunders than to secure\r\naccuracy by trust in a leader. The skilful teacher can give fitting\r\nwords of caution which may help a student to find the true way, but\r\nany reference of his undertakings to masterpieces is sure to breed a\r\nservile habit. Therefore such comparisons are fitting only after the\r\nhabit of free work has been well formed. The student who can afford\r\nthe help of a master, or, better, the assistance of many, such as some\r\nof our universities offer, should by all means avail himself of this\r\nresource. More than any other science, geology, because of the\r\ncomplexity of the considerations with which it has to deal, depends\r\nupon methods of labour which are to a great extent traditional, and\r\nwhich can not, indeed, be well transmitted except in the personal way.\r\nIn the distinctly limited sciences, such as mathematics, physics, or\r\neven those which deal with organic bodies, the methods of work can be\r\nso far set forth in printed directions that the student may to a great\r\nextent acquire sound ways of work without the help of a teacher.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a vast and important literature concerning geology,\r\nthe greater part of it is of a very special nature, and will convey to\r\nthe beginner no substantial information whatever. It is not until he\r\nhas become familiar with the field with which he is enabled to deal in\r\nthe actual way that he can transfer experience thus acquired to other\r\ngrounds. Therefore beyond the pleasing views which he may obtain by\r\nreading certain general works on the science, the student should at\r\nthe outset of his inquiry limit his work as far as possible to his\r\nfield of practice, using a good text-book, such as Dana's Manual of\r\nGeology, as a source of suggestions as to the problems which his field\r\nmay afford.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of the student in this, as in other branches of inquiry,\r\nis to gain practice in following out the natural series of actions. To\r\nthe primitive man the phenomenal world presents itself as a mere\r\nphantasmagoria, a vast show in which the things seen are only related\r\nto each other by the fact that they come at once into view. The end of\r\nscience is to divine the order of this host, and the ways in which it\r\nis marshalled in its onward movement and the ends to which its march\r\nappears to be directed. So far as the student observes well, and thus\r\ngains a clear notion of separated facts, he is in a fair way to\r\ngather the data of knowledge which may be useful; but the real value\r\nof these discernments is not gained until the observations go\r\ntogether, so as to make something with a perspective. Until the store\r\nof separate facts is thus arranged, it is merely crude material for\r\nthought; it is not in the true meaning science, any more than a store\r\nof stone and mortar is architecture. When the student has developed an\r\nappetite for the appreciation of order and sources of energy in\r\nphenomena, he has passed his novitiate, and becomes one of that happy\r\nbody of men who not only see what is perceived by the mass of their\r\nfellows, but are enabled to look through those chains of action which,\r\nwhen comprehended, serve to rationalize and ennoble all that the\r\nsenses of man, aided by the instruments which he has devised, tell us\r\nconcerning the visible world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n    Ætna, Mount, 381.\r\n\r\n    Agriculture,\r\n      American, 346;\r\n      in England, winning swamp lands for, 335;\r\n      recent developments of, 345.\r\n\r\n    Alaska, changes on the coast of, 96.\r\n\r\n    Ants taking food underground, 319;\r\n      work of the, on the soil, 318.\r\n\r\n    Apsides, revolution of the, 61, 62.\r\n\r\n    Arabians, chemical experiments of the, 13.\r\n\r\n    Arches, natural, in cavern districts, 258.\r\n\r\n    Artesian wells, 258, 259.\r\n\r\n    Arts, advance of Italian fine, 19.\r\n\r\n    Asteroids, 53;\r\n      motions of, about their centres and about the sun, 53.\r\n\r\n    Astronomers, the solar system and the early, 79.\r\n\r\n    Astronomy, 31-80;\r\n      growth of, since the time of Galileo, 33, 34;\r\n      the first science, 10.\r\n\r\n    Atmosphere, 97-206;\r\n      along the tropical belt, 102;\r\n      as a medium of communication between different regions, 99;\r\n      deprived of water, containing little heat, 105;\r\n      beginning of the science of the, 117;\r\n      counter-trade movements of the, 105;\r\n      envelope of the earth, 98;\r\n      expansion of, in a hollow wall during the passage of a storm, 114;\r\n      heat-carrying power of the, 105;\r\n      heights to which it extends, 99;\r\n      in water, 99;\r\n      movements no direct influence on the surface of the earth, 122;\r\n      movements of the, qualified by the condition which\r\n            it encounters, 118;\r\n      of mountains, 98;\r\n      of the seashore, 98;\r\n      of the earth, 98;\r\n      of the sun, 73;\r\n      snow as an evidence of, 65;\r\n      supplying needs of underground creatures, 331;\r\n      uprushes of, 101, 102;\r\n      upward strain of the, next the earth, 107;\r\n      weight and motion of the, 120, 121.\r\n\r\n    Atmospheric circulation of the soil, 330, 331;\r\n      envelopes, 97.\r\n\r\n    Aurora borealis, 168.\r\n\r\n    Avalanches, 210-213;\r\n      dreaded, in the Alpine regions, 212;\r\n      great, in the Swiss Oberland, 211, 212;\r\n      rocky, 175-177.\r\n\r\n    Axis,\r\n      imaginary changes in the earth's, 59;\r\n      of the earth's rotation, 58;\r\n      polar, inclined position of, 58;\r\n      polar, nodding movement of the axes, 54;\r\n      rotations of the planetary spheres on their axes, 56.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Barometer, causes of changes in the, 117, 118.\r\n\r\n    Basalts, 309.\r\n\r\n    Beaches, 93, 142, 144;\r\n      boulder, 142, 143;\r\n      pebbly, 142;\r\n      sand, 144.\r\n\r\n    Beetles, work of, on the soil, 318, 319.\r\n\r\n    Belief of the early astronomers about the solar system, 79.\r\n\r\n    _Bergschrund_, the, 214.\r\n\r\n    Birds and mammals contributing to the fertility of the soil, 319.\r\n\r\n    \"Blanketing,\" 269.\r\n\r\n    Bogs,\r\n      climbing, 331-334;\r\n      lake, 331-333;\r\n      peat, 334, 335;\r\n      quaking, 334.\r\n\r\n    Botany, rapid advance in, 14, 15.\r\n\r\n    Boulders, 217, 220.\r\n\r\n    Breakers, 135, 137, 139.\r\n\r\n    Bridges, natural, 257, 258.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canals of Mars, 67.\r\n\r\n    Cañon, newly formed river cutting a, 195.\r\n\r\n    Cataracts, 193.\r\n\r\n    Caves, 253-258, 261;\r\n      architecture of, 255-258;\r\n      hot-water, 261;\r\n      mammoth cave, 258;\r\n      stalactites and stalagmites on the roof and floor of, 257.\r\n\r\n    Chasms, 140, 141.\r\n\r\n    Chemistry, 6, 12, 14;\r\n      advance of, 12;\r\n      modern, evolving from the studies of alchemists, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n    Chromosphere, 73.\r\n\r\n    Civilization of the Icelanders, 384.\r\n\r\n    Cliffs, sea-beaten, 132, 141, 142.\r\n\r\n    Climate,\r\n      changes of, due to modifications of the ocean streams, 153;\r\n      effect of the ocean on the, 147;\r\n      of the Gulf Stream, 149, 150.\r\n\r\n    Clouds, 159;\r\n      formation of, 162, 163;\r\n      shape of, 163;\r\n      water of, usually frozen, 207;\r\n      cloud-making, laws of, 161, 162.\r\n\r\n    Coast,\r\n      changes on the Scandinavian, 96;\r\n      line, effect of tide on the, 145;\r\n      of Greenland, 226;\r\n      of New Jersey sinking, 95;\r\n      marine, changes in, 95.\r\n\r\n    Cold in Siberia, 243.\r\n\r\n    Comets, 47, 50;\r\n      collisions of, 50;\r\n      kinship of meteorites and, 48;\r\n      omens of calamity to the ancients, 50;\r\n      the great, of 1811, 49, 50.\r\n\r\n    Cones.
