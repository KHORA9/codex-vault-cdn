King\r\n\r\n  Respectively, associate professor, Department of Plant Physiology and\r\n  Pathology, and associate professor, Department of Entomology.\r\n\r\nThe pecan tree must be protected from attack by the many destructive\r\ndiseases and insects that affect it to produce a bountiful nut crop.\r\n\r\nThe diseases that affect the pecan, especially those caused by fungi,\r\nare rapidly spread throughout the trees in an orchard in the early\r\nspring. During this season of frequent rains, the spores of the disease\r\nfungi germinate and invade the young tender tissues of the shoots,\r\nleaves and nuts. Under conditions of prolonged damp weather, when the\r\nhumidity remains high, the disease organisms reproduce at a rapid rate\r\nand cause severe shedding of leaves and nuts.\r\n\r\nPecans are attacked by more than 20 species of insects that cause damage\r\nto leaves, nuts, twigs, buds, branches and even the bark. The\r\ndevelopment of commercial pecan acreages has provided ideal conditions\r\nfor the increase in severity of both disease and insect damage because\r\nof the abundant food supply in a concentrated planting of pecans. In its\r\nnatural habitat the pecan is less subject to the devastations of\r\ndiseases and insects.\r\n\r\nThe many destructive insects and diseases must be controlled for\r\nsuccessful pecan production. The pecan grower must also understand the\r\nnature and habits of the various disease and insect pests that threaten\r\nhis crop and use certain cultural practices which help to reduce damage\r\nfrom diseases and insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Pecan Diseases and Their Control_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diseases which affect the pecan are of four different types: namely\r\nfungus, bacterial, virus and physiological. The fungus diseases, the\r\nmost numerous and widespread, are caused by small microscopic molds.\r\nApproximately 12 different fungus organisms cause harmful diseases of\r\nthe pecan.\r\n\r\nThe bacterial disease organisms, unlike the disease producing fungi, are\r\nsingle celled and can be seen only under a microscope. Bacterial\r\ndiseases are fewer and of less economic importance than fungus diseases.\r\n\r\nVirus diseases are caused by extremely small agents which can be seen\r\nonly under special ultra-microscopes such as the electron microscope.\r\nPlant viruses are protein substances, but their exact nature is unknown.\r\n\r\nPhysiological disorders (sometimes called physiological diseases) are\r\ncaused by a variety of environmental conditions. A physiological\r\ndisorder in a pecan tree may result from infertile soil, excessive\r\nmoisture, or the absence or degree of available nutritional mineral\r\nelements to the growing tree. These various environmental factors have\r\nspecial adverse effects, manifested by specific symptoms caused by\r\ninsufficient levels of a given nutritional mineral element or elements,\r\nwhich are easily corrected by supplying the tree the necessary mineral\r\nelements either through soil application or foliage sprays.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAB\r\n\r\nPecan scab, caused by the fungus _Cladosporium effusum_ (Wint.) Demaree,\r\nis the most destructive disease of pecans in Texas. The fungus invades\r\nthe young rapidly growing shoots and leaves and later the developing\r\nnuts. Severely infected nuts on highly scab-susceptible varieties fall\r\nor fail to develop, resulting in a total nut crop loss. Early season\r\ndefoliation often occurs in seasons of frequent rains and high humidity\r\nwhich facilitate the rapid development and spread of the scab fungus.\r\n\r\nThe scab fungus overwinters in infected shoots and in old shucks and\r\nleaves in the trees. In the spring when temperature and moisture\r\nconditions become favorable, the fungus begins to grow in the shoot\r\nlesions, old leaves and shucks, and within a few days produces great\r\nnumbers of spores. These spores are spread by wind and rain to newly\r\ndeveloped leaves where they germinate and invade the tender tissues,\r\ninitiating primary infection. The fungus produces a great abundance of\r\nspores on the surface of these primary infection sites and spreads\r\nthroughout the tree and infects young shoots, leaves and nuts.\r\n\r\nOn the leaves, primary infection lesions occur on the lower leaf\r\nsurfaces and are characteristically olive brown, somewhat elongated in\r\nshape and vary in size from a barely discernible dot to lesions\r\none-fourth inch or more in diameter. Frequently, adjacent lesions\r\ncoalesce, forming large very dark lesions. Primary scab lesions commonly\r\noccur on or along the leaflet veins but often may be found between the\r\nveins on the underleaf surface. On the nuts, scab lesions appear as\r\nsmall black dots, which are elevated or sunken in older infections.\r\nAdjacent lesions on the nuts may coalesce forming large sunken black\r\nlesions, Figure 1. When infection is severe, the entire nut surface is\r\nblack in appearance, development is arrested and the nuts drop\r\nprematurely.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Scab lesions on leaves and nuts of Delmas\r\n    variety. Note concave lesions and overall scabby appearance of\r\n    severely infected nuts.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Infected nuts.]\r\n\r\nPecan varieties vary in their susceptibility to scab disease. Among the\r\nhighly susceptible varieties are: Burkett, Delmas, Schley, Moore,\r\nHalbert and most western varieties. Moneymaker, Success and Curtis are\r\nmoderately resistant. Mahan, Stuart and Desirable varieties are highly\r\nresistant to the scab fungus. However, this character of resistance\r\nvaries, depending on the area of the state, local environmental\r\nconditions and the particular strain of the scab fungus present.\r\n\r\nScab disease development is favored by rainy periods and cloudy days\r\nwhen the humidity remains high and leaf surfaces are wet. Under these\r\nconditions, spores of the fungus in contact with the wet leaf surface of\r\na pecan leaflet or nut germinate rapidly, invade the tender tissues and\r\ninitiate infection within 6 hours. Lesions resulting from these\r\ninfection sites, become visible to the naked eye within 7 to 14 days,\r\ndepending on environmental conditions. A period of warm dry weather\r\nafter infection occurs may retard lesion development.\r\n\r\n_Control._—The control of pecan scab disease depends primarily on the\r\nprotection of tender leaf, nut and shoot surfaces with proper\r\napplication of an effective fungicide. A protective film of fungicide\r\nchemical prevents scab fungus infections by killing the spores\r\nimmediately after their germination, thereby preventing invasion of\r\nsusceptible tissues. Unfortunately, once the fungus has invaded the\r\ntissues it becomes protected from chemical attack and produces spores in\r\ngreat abundance. Therefore, thorough coverage of leaf, nut and shoot\r\nsurfaces with a fungicide chemical must be maintained to prevent\r\nsecondary infections, ([6], [10], [11]).\r\n\r\nSanitation measures, such as removal of old attached shucks and leaf\r\nstems in trees and plowing or disk harrowing under fallen leaves and\r\nshucks help reduce primary infections. See spray schedule, page 4, for\r\nscab disease control.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN LEAF SPOT\r\n\r\nThe brown leaf spot disease fungus _Cercospora fusca_ (Heald and Walf)\r\nRand affects only mature leaves and usually does not appear until the\r\nlatter part of May or mid-June. Primary lesions develop on the lower\r\nleaf surfaces as small dots, which gradually enlarge and become reddish\r\nbrown with a grayish cast. The shape of the lesions may be circular or\r\nirregular, especially where two or more lesions develop adjacent to one\r\nanother, Figure 2. In seasons favorable for brown leaf spot development\r\npecan trees may be completely defoliated within 3 to 4 months if the\r\ndisease is not controlled. Most pecan varieties which are maintained in\r\na vigorous state of growth are resistant to brown spot disease.\r\n\r\n_Control._—See spray schedule, page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEIN SPOT\r\n\r\nVein spot disease is caused by the fungus _Gnomonia nerviseda_. The\r\nsymptoms of the disease are similar to the leaf lesion symptoms of scab\r\ndisease, but vein spot disease, unlike scab disease, affects only the\r\nleaves. Lesions of vein spot disease develop on the veins or stems of\r\nleaflets and leaves, are usually less than one-fourth inch in diameter\r\nand are characteristically dark brown to black. Leaflets and leaf stems\r\nwhich are severely affected drop, resulting in premature defoliation.\r\n\r\nThe fungus lives in fallen leaves over the winter. The following spring\r\nwhen temperature and moisture conditions are favorable, spores formed in\r\nspecial structures called perithecia are forcibly discharged into the\r\nair and carried by wind currents to the newly formed spring foliage,\r\ninitiating primary infections.\r\n\r\n_Control._—See spray schedule, page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF BLOTCH\r\n\r\nLeaf blotch disease is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella dendroides_\r\n(Cke.) Demaree and Cole. The disease occurs mainly in trees of poor\r\nvigor, which may be due to neglect, infertile soil, rosette or\r\novercrowding. Nursery trees are particularly susceptible to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe fungus overwinters in fallen leaves. In the early spring, large\r\nnumbers of spores produced in the old leaves on the ground are carried\r\nby wind currents to the young leaves in the tree, where they germinate\r\nand rapidly invade the tender leaf tissue.\r\n\r\nThe disease symptoms first appear on the undersurface of mature leaves\r\nin early summer, as small olive-green velvety spots. By midsummer black\r\npimplelike dots become especially noticeable in the leaf spots after the\r\nsurface spore masses have been removed by wind and rain, giving the\r\ndiseased areas of the leaves a black, shiny appearance. When the disease\r\nis severe, infected leaflets are killed, which causes defoliation of the\r\ntrees in late summer or early fall and results in reduced tree vigor and\r\nincreased susceptibility to disease and insect attack.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Leaf blotch disease can be controlled effectively in the\r\nearly spring by disking under old fallen leaves that harbor the fungus\r\npathogen.\r\n\r\nIn areas where a spray program for the control of scab disease is\r\ncarried out, leaf blotch usually is not a damaging disease. In\r\nlocalities where leaf blotch disease occurs in the absence of other\r\npecan diseases, two applications of fungicide will control the disease\r\neffectively. The first spray should be applied after pollination when\r\nthe tips of the nutlets have turned brown and the second spray\r\napplication should be made 3 to 4 weeks later. See spray schedule, page\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWN GALL\r\n\r\nCrown gall disease, caused by the bacterium _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_\r\n(E. F. and Town.) Conn., often is damaging to pecan trees. Nursery trees\r\nas well as trees in bearing pecan orchards are susceptible to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Brown leaf spot diseased pecan leaflet\r\n    showing typical symptoms. Lesions are circular to irregular in\r\n    shape.]\r\n\r\nThe development of galls is confined primarily to larger roots near the\r\nbase of the tree trunk, although small roots may become infected and\r\ngalls develop on them. The smaller galls are under the soil surface and\r\ncannot be detected unless the soil is carefully removed from around the\r\nroots, Figure 3. Large galls, often 10 to 18 inches in diameter, develop\r\non larger roots and may protrude well above the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Crown gall disease symptoms on young\r\n    infected pecan tree.]\r\n\r\nGalls on nursery trees develop at or below the soil surface on the\r\ntaproot and larger secondary roots.\r\n\r\n_Control._—All infected nursery trees should be dug and immediately\r\nburned. Crown gall-diseased orchard trees sometimes can be saved by\r\ndigging the soil from around large roots and removing the exposed galls.\r\nWhere galls were removed, the damaged root surfaces should be painted\r\nwith a creosote-coal tar mixture (one part creosote to three parts coal\r\ntar) to prevent spread of the disease[9]. Cultivation of the soil around\r\nthe trunk base of infected trees should be avoided to prevent root\r\nwounds and spreading of the crown gall pathogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNY SPOT\r\n\r\nDowny spot disease, caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella caryigena_\r\n(Ell. and Ev.) Damaree and Cole, attacks all pecan varieties. Only\r\nleaves are susceptible to the disease. Primary infection of new leaves\r\nin the spring occurs from spores produced in specialized fruiting bodies\r\nin old overwintered leaves. The downy spots appear usually during the\r\nsummer months on the lower surfaces of leaflets. The downy character of\r\nthe lesions is due to the production by the fungus of thousands of\r\nminute spores on the surface of each spot. The spores are spread by wind\r\nand rain to adjacent leaves and to neighboring trees. After spore\r\ndissemination is complete, the lesions visible from both leaf surfaces\r\nare one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter and greenish yellow. Later\r\nin the season the lesions turn brown due to the death of the leaf cells\r\nin the diseased area.\r\n\r\nMoneymaker and Stuart varieties are most susceptible to downy spot\r\ndisease although all pecan varieties are moderately to slightly\r\nsusceptible.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Disk under old fallen leaves in the early spring before the\r\nleafbuds begin to swell. This practice covers the leaves with soil and\r\nprevents the discharge of spores into the air, thereby controlling\r\nprimary infection of new leaves. In seasons when heavy rains make early\r\nspring disking impossible, downy spot disease can be controlled by\r\nspraying the trees as indicated in the spray schedule on page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNCH DISEASE\r\n\r\nAlthough the cause of bunch disease is not known, evidence indicates it\r\nis an infectious disease, which suggests that the causal agent may be a\r\nvirus.\r\n\r\nTrees affected with bunch disease show the bunching symptom, which is\r\ndue to excessive growth of slender succulent twigs from lateral buds\r\nthat normally remain dormant. In moderately affected trees one or\r\nseveral branches will show the “bunch” growth symptom. Bunching in\r\nseverely affected trees may involve all main branches which produce\r\nthick masses of sucker-like growth and few, if any, nuts.\r\n\r\nObservations indicate that the Stuart variety is the most resistant to\r\nbunch disease.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Rosette die-back symptoms of pecan tree\r\n    showing severe zinc deficiency.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—There is no known effective control for bunch disease. Early\r\ndetection of the first symptom of bunch and pruning out of the affected\r\nbranch may prevent spread of the disease throughout the tree. When the\r\ntree is severely affected, and limbs are involved, the tree should be\r\ndestroyed to protect nearby healthy trees from infection.\r\n\r\nFor propagation purposes, all bud or scion wood should be taken only\r\nfrom bunch disease-free trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSETTE\r\n\r\nRosette is a nutritional deficiency disease caused by certain soil\r\nconditions which make zinc unavailable to the pecan tree. All pecan\r\ntrees require zinc for growth.\r\n\r\nTrees showing the first symptom of zinc deficiency have yellowed tops.\r\nThe individual leaflets when examined are yellowish and mottled. The\r\nnext season the foliage may be yellowish and the leaflets narrowed and\r\ncrinkled. More severely affected trees produce foliage which is a\r\nyellowish to reddish-brown overall color, and the leaflets are very\r\nnarrow with reddish-brown spots and may be perforated. Shoots are much\r\nshortened and the leaves are produced in compact bunches of dense\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nTrees affected by rosette for several seasons have many dead shoots and\r\nsmall branches from the dying-back of each season’s growth, Figure 4.\r\nSuch trees are greatly stunted, of poor vigor and produce few, if any,\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Rosette is controlled readily by applying zinc sulfate to the\r\ntree either as a foliage spray or in the dry form as a soil application.\r\nWhere a disease and insect spray control program is being carried out,\r\nzinc sulfate may be added to the spray mixture.\r\n\r\nFoliage spray. Two pounds zinc sulfate (36 percent) per 100 gallons of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFirst application: after pollination when tips of nutlets turn brown.\r\n\r\nSecond application: 3 to 4 weeks later.\r\n\r\nThird application: 3 to 4 weeks later.\r\n\r\nSoil application. Application of zinc sulfate to the soil, particularly\r\nin a large orchard is a more expensive operation, but it provides longer\r\nprotection against rosette.\r\n\r\nIn highly alkaline soils, or soils that readily fix zinc and make it\r\nunavailable to the tree, foliage spray applications of zinc sulfate are\r\nmore economical because of the excessive rates required to supply\r\navailable zinc through the soil.\r\n\r\nRate of application of zinc sulfate: Mildly rosetted trees—apply 5\r\npounds zinc sulfate (36 percent) annually for 2 to 3 years. Severely\r\nrosetted trees—apply 5 to 10 pounds zinc sulfate (36 percent) annually\r\nuntil rosette symptoms disappear.\r\n\r\nTime and method of application: Apply zinc sulfate to the soil around\r\ntrees in late February or early March. Broadcast zinc sulfate under the\r\ntree from the trunk to several feet beyond the limb canopy. Disking,\r\nharrowing, or any operation that mixes the zinc sulfate with the soil,\r\nis desirable to prevent washing away and surface soil fixing of zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICHENS\r\n\r\nLichens commonly are found growing on the branches and trunks of pecan\r\ntrees, especially in humid areas and river bottom orchards having poor\r\nair drainage.\r\n\r\nLichens are nonparasitic to the pecan tree, but merely attach themselves\r\nto the bark surfaces. Lichens grow equally well on rocks, fence posts,\r\nbricks and other objects. There are several types of lichens that occur\r\non pecan trees, none of which are damaging except perhaps in appearance\r\nto the trees in cases of extremely heavy infestations, Figure 5.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. Lichens commonly found on the bark of pecan\r\n    trees. Left, a fan-shaped type. Right, an erect-branched type.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—The occurrence of lichens in trees regularly sprayed with\r\ncopper-containing fungicides is rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULARIA LEAF MOLD\r\n\r\nArticularia leaf mold caused by the fungus _Articularia quercina_ (PK)\r\nHoehn is a disease of minor occurrence and importance. The disease\r\noccurs most commonly following rainy periods and in areas of high\r\nrelative humidity in the leaves of trees of poor vigor.\r\n\r\nThe fungus produces on the lower surfaces of the leaves a conspicuous\r\ngrowth of white tufts which contain masses of spores, Figure 6.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Articularia leaf mold fungus, showing white\r\n    tufts on lower leaf surfaces of pecan leaflets.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—Articularia leaf mold does not occur in trees or in orchards\r\nwhich have been sprayed for disease control.\r\n\r\nA single application of fungicide such as zineb at 2 pounds per 100\r\ngallons of water when the disease is first detected is usually\r\nsufficient to control Articularia leaf mold disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK MOLD\r\n\r\nPink mold, _Cephalothecium roseum_ Corda, usually occurs on nuts\r\ninfected with the scab fungus. The pink mold fungus apparently enters\r\nthe nuts through scab lesions on the shucks and continues to produce\r\nmasses of pink spores on shuck surfaces until late fall. The fungus\r\nsometimes invades the kernel of thin-shelled pecan varieties causing\r\n“pink rot” which is characterized by an oily appearance of the nut shell\r\nand a rancid odor.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Pink mold rarely occurs on the shucks of nuts in the absence\r\nof scab disease. In areas where scab disease control is regularly\r\npracticed pink mold is not a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH AND BALL MOSS\r\n\r\nSpanish moss, _Tillandsia usneoides_, and Ball moss, _Tillandsia\r\nrecurvata_ L., are not parasitic to the pecan tree and are similar to\r\nlichens in that they both derive their food from the air, rain or\r\natmospheric moisture.\r\n\r\nNeglected orchards in areas of high humidity or poor air drainage are\r\nmost troubled with Spanish moss and Ball moss. When large and excessive\r\ngrowths of Spanish moss develop in pecan trees, the shading effect to\r\nthe leaves is detrimental to tree vigor, bearing and growth, Figure 7.\r\n\r\n_Control._—The Spanish moss plant like the pecan tree requires sunlight\r\nfor vigorous growth. A pecan tree kept in a vigorous state of growth\r\nproduces dense foliage that effectively shades accumulations of Spanish\r\nmoss and retards its growth.\r\n\r\nSpanish moss is not a problem in pecan trees in orchards which are\r\nsprayed with fungicide for disease control. Both Spanish moss and Ball\r\nmoss can be controlled by spraying pecan trees with 6 pounds of lead\r\narsenate per 100 gallons of water[3]. Do not allow livestock to graze in\r\norchards sprayed with lead arsenate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTON ROOT ROT\r\n\r\nCotton root rot disease is caused by the fungus _Phymatotrichum\r\nomnivorum_ (Shear) Dvgg., a soil-inhabiting pathogen that attacks a wide\r\nrange of host plants including the pecan.\r\n\r\nThe roots of the pecan tree are invaded during the summer when growth of\r\nthe fungus in the soil is most active. The infected roots are killed,\r\ndisrupting the transportation of water to the leaves, Figure 8. Trees\r\ndiseased by cotton root rot produce yellow foliage, and shedding of\r\nleaflets occurs during dry periods. Diseased trees usually die 1 to 3\r\nyears after becoming infected.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. Spanish moss accumulation in pecan trees\r\n    reduces vigor from excessive shading.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8. Cotton root infected with cotton root rot\r\n    fungus. Note the splitting and general deterioration of the root.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—An effective control for cotton root rot disease has not been\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nNew orchards should not be planted in soil having a history of cotton\r\nroot rot disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Pecan Insects and Their Control_\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN NUT CASEBEARER\r\n\r\nThe pecan nut casebearer, _Acrobasis caryae_ Grote, is the major pest of\r\npecans in Texas. Early in the spring, the overwintered generation feeds\r\nfirst in the buds and then in the developing shoots, causing them to\r\nwilt and die. Succeeding generations feed on the nuts during the late\r\nspring and summer, Figure 9. Severe infestations may destroy the entire\r\ncrop of pecans.\r\n\r\nThe adult is a light gray moth which is about one third inch in length.\r\nThe wings are gray, and the forewings have a ridge of dark scales across\r\nthem about one-third the distance from the base. The moths fly at night\r\nand spend the day in concealment.\r\n\r\nThe young larvae are white to pink, but later become olive gray to green\r\nand attain a length of about one-half inch.\r\n\r\nThis insect passes the winter as a partially grown larva in a tiny\r\nsilken cocoon called a hibernaculum, which is usually attached to a bud,\r\nFigure 10. In the spring, the larvae feed for a short time on the buds,\r\nafter which they tunnel in the developing shoots until they reach\r\nmaturity, Figure 11. Pupation usually occurs in these burrows, and the\r\nmoths emerge in late April and May.\r\n\r\nTwo or 3 days after the adults emerge, they deposit eggs on the tips of\r\nthe nuts, Figure 12. Each female may deposit from 50 to 150 eggs. The\r\neggs, which are just visible to the naked eye, are greenish white when\r\nthey are deposited but assume a reddish appearance a few days later. The\r\nfirst-generation larvae hatch from the eggs in 4 or 5 days and migrate\r\nto the buds below the nuts to feed. After a day or two, they enter the\r\nnuts, usually at the base, and feed in them, each larva frequently\r\ndestroying an entire cluster. Bits of frass and webbing may be observed\r\nprojecting from the injured nuts. Upon reaching maturity, the larvae\r\npupate in the nuts and emerge as adults in June and early July.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9. Injury to nuts caused by first generation\r\n    larvae of the pecan nut casebearer.]\r\n\r\nThe adults deposit eggs in grooves on the tips or bases of the nuts.\r\nSecond-generation larvae which hatch from these eggs also feed in the\r\nnuts. Less injury is produced by this generation because the nuts are\r\nlarger and each larva requires only one or two nuts to complete its\r\ndevelopment. Pupation takes place in the hollowed out nuts, Figure 13,\r\nand the moths emerge from late July to early September.\r\n\r\nA third generation usually follows, but the shells of the nuts have\r\nbecome hard, and only a few of them are penetrated by the larvae.\r\nInstead, they feed in the shucks. A number of third-generation larvae\r\nconstruct hibernacula, while the remainder pupate and appear as adults,\r\nemerging from late August to October. These adults deposit eggs, which\r\nhatch into fourth-generation larvae. If nuts are available, their shucks\r\nconstitute the principal food of the larvae of this generation. In the\r\nabsence of nuts, the larvae feed on buds and leaf stems. Overwintering\r\nhibernacula are constructed by the partially grown larvae by the middle\r\nof November[2].\r\n\r\n_Control._—The necessity for control of this pest may be determined by\r\nexamination of the trees when the shoots appear in the spring. If a\r\nnumber of them are wilted, the following control measures probably will\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nA spray application should be made when eggs of the first generation\r\nappear on the tips of the young nuts in late April or May. The period of\r\negg deposition usually coincides with the completion of pollination, at\r\nwhich time the tips of the nuts turn brown. Satisfactory control may be\r\nobtained by using any of several insecticides. See spray schedule, page\r\n4.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, only one application of spray is required to control the nut\r\ncasebearer. However, if trees surrounding the treated area are not\r\nsprayed, moths may enter the sprayed area and a serious infestation of\r\nsecond-generation larvae may develop. Under these circumstances, a\r\nsecond spray may be required in June or early July when\r\nsecond-generation eggs are deposited[6], [11].\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORY SHUCKWORM\r\n\r\nThe hickory shuckworm, _Laspeyresia caryana_ (Fitch), frequently causes\r\nsevere injury to pecans. In the late summer and fall the shucks are\r\ntunneled out. As a result, the nuts are slower to mature and the kernels\r\ndo not develop properly. The shucks stick to the nuts and fail to open,\r\nthus increasing the difficulty of harvest.\r\n\r\nThe adult shuckworm is a dark, grayish-black moth with a wing span of a\r\nlittle over one-half inch. The larva is white with a light brown head.\r\nIt attains a length of three-eighths inch at maturity.\r\n\r\nThe winter is passed by the larvae in fallen pecan or hickory shucks.\r\nThey pupate in late winter and emerge as adults during the spring. The\r\nadults deposit eggs principally on hickory trees on the leaves and young\r\nnuts, and the larvae feed in developing nuts in early summer.\r\n\r\nSucceeding generations develop in pecan shucks. Before pupating, the\r\nlarvae cut a hole to the outside, and then spin a cocoon. When the moth\r\nemerges, the empty pupal skin is left projecting from the hole and can\r\nbe seen afterward on the shuck. As many as five generations may be\r\ncompleted each year before the last generation larvae go into\r\nhibernation.\r\n\r\n_Control._—No economical chemical control for the shuckworm has been\r\ndeveloped. Cultural measures will aid in reducing populations. Plowing\r\nduring July and August to turn under the infested shucks is relatively\r\neffective. The larvae are unable to mature in the decaying shucks, and\r\nthe adults cannot emerge from the soil. Care should be taken to\r\ncompletely cover the fallen shucks, but the depth of plowing should be\r\nregulated or damage to the roots will result.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10. Location of overwintering cocoons, or\r\n    hibernacula, of the pecan nut casebearer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN WEEVIL\r\n\r\nThe pecan weevil, _Curculio caryae_ (Horn), is a late-season pest of\r\npecans in Texas. In years when severe infestations occur, this insect\r\nmay destroy a large portion of the pecan crop. The kernels are eaten out\r\nby the larvae.\r\n\r\nThe adult is a brownish weevil which is about three-eighths inch long.\r\nThe female has a snout which is as long as the body; the male’s is\r\nsomewhat shorter.\r\n\r\nThe weevil appears in late August and early September. After the nut\r\nkernels have hardened, the female chews a hole in the shell and deposits\r\nher eggs in little pockets in the nuts. Creamy white grubs hatch from\r\nthe eggs and feed inside the nuts during the fall, attaining a length of\r\nabout three-fifths inch. When they reach maturity, the grubs chew a hole\r\nabout one-eighth inch in diameter in the shell, emerge from the nut and\r\ndrop to the ground in late fall and early winter. They burrow in the\r\nsoil to a depth of 4 to 12 inches and construct a cell. Some individuals\r\nremain in the larval stage until the following fall when pupation\r\noccurs. Other larvae do not transform to pupae until the succeeding\r\nyear. The adults appear during the summer, following pupation. The\r\nentire life cycle requires from 2 to 3 years, most of this time being\r\nspent in the soil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11. Overwintered larva of the pecan nut\r\n    casebearer and characteristic injury to the developing shoots.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—Frequently, certain trees in the orchard are more heavily\r\ninfested than others, since the adults usually do not go far from the\r\ntree upon which they developed. The time at which insecticide\r\napplications should be made to control this insect can be determined by\r\njarring the trees. Begin checking the first week in August. A large\r\nsheet should be placed under a tree and the limbs jarred with a padded\r\npole. The weevils drop to the ground and remain motionless for a short\r\nperiod, at which time they may be counted. When three or more weevils\r\nare jarred from each tree, an application of spray containing 6 pounds\r\nof 50 percent DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of water should be\r\nmade[8].\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12. Eggs of the first generation pecan nut\r\n    casebearer deposited on the tips of the young nuts.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTINK AND PLANT BUGS\r\n\r\nThe adults of several species of stink bugs and plant bugs suck the sap\r\nfrom young pecan nuts causing an injury known as black pit, in which the\r\ninterior of the nuts turns black. The injured nuts fall from the trees\r\nbefore the shells harden.\r\n\r\nFeeding by the insects after shell hardening, Figure 14, produces brown\r\nor black spots on the kernels. Areas affected taste bitter, but the\r\nremainder of the kernel is unaffected.\r\n\r\nStink bugs are familiar to everyone. Plant bugs resemble them and are\r\nusually shades of brown, smaller and narrower in body outline.\r\n\r\nPlant bugs and stink bugs overwinter in the adult stage in debris on the\r\nground. In the spring, the adults are attracted to growing vegetation\r\nsuch as cover crops or weeds, where they deposit their eggs. The\r\nimmature bugs develop on low-growing vegetation. When they reach\r\nmaturity, their wings are fully developed and they fly to pecan trees. A\r\nfew eggs may be deposited on pecan trees, but the young bugs apparently\r\nare unable to develop on them. Only the adults are present in sufficient\r\nnumber to inflict economic injury. There may be as many as four\r\ngenerations each year.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Although certain insecticides will control these pests, the\r\nnumber and frequency of spray applications necessary for control would\r\nnot be economical.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to keep weeds down in the orchard during the\r\ngrowing season. Winter cover crops should be plowed down early in the\r\nspring so they will not be attractive to the adults coming out of\r\nhibernation. If this operation is delayed, the bugs will leave the cover\r\ncrop when it is removed and migrate to the trees in large numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHIDS\r\n\r\nThese soft-bodied insects appear during the summer and fall. They suck\r\nthe sap from the leaves, causing them to turn yellow or brown and fall\r\nto the ground. Heavy infestations may cause defoliation in the late\r\nsummer reducing the nut crop in the current and succeeding year.\r\n\r\nThe black pecan aphid, _Melanocallis caryaefoliae_ (Davis), is about\r\none-sixteenth inch long when full grown, robust and greenish black. Its\r\nback is decorated with tubercles.\r\n\r\nBright yellow blotches up to one-fourth inch in diameter appear around\r\nthe punctures produced by the feeding of this insect.\r\n\r\nThe yellow aphids, _Monellia_ spp., which attack pecans inflict injury\r\nsimilar to that caused by the black pecan aphid. However, the large\r\nyellow blotches on the leaves do not result from their feeding. A sticky\r\nsubstance called “honeydew” is secreted by these insects creating an\r\nideal medium for sooty mold fungus to develop[5].\r\n\r\nBoth black and yellow aphids overwinter in the egg stage in crevices in\r\nthe bark. In the spring the eggs hatch, and the aphids begin feeding on\r\nthe leaves. Many generations are completed each year. Only females,\r\nwhich may be wingless or winged, are produced during the growing season.\r\nThe winged individuals fly to different parts of the tree or to other\r\ntrees. In the fall, males and females appear and eggs are deposited\r\nunder the bark.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 13. Pupa of the second generation of the pecan\r\n    nut casebearer in a hollowed out nut.]\r\n\r\nUsually, these insects are not present in sufficient numbers to cause\r\nserious injury until mid or late summer. Infestations earlier in the\r\nseason rarely assume damaging proportions. As is the case with mites,\r\naphid populations may increase, following the application of certain\r\ninsecticides applied for the control of the pecan nut casebearer or\r\nfollowing treatment with bordeaux mixture for pecan scab disease\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 14. Southern green stink bug on developing\r\n    nuts.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—When damaging infestations appear, the trees should be\r\nsprayed with either 1 pound of 12 percent gamma BHC wettable powder; or\r\n1 pint of 40 percent nicotine sulfate plus 3 pounds of soap; or 1 pound\r\nof 25 percent parathion wettable powder[9].\r\n\r\n\r\nMITES\r\n\r\nThese tiny pests attack the leaves usually on the underside causing\r\nirregular brown areas to appear. Trees which are heavily infested appear\r\nscorched and may lose their leaves in late summer or fall.\r\n\r\nMites usually are light green and are just large enough to be seen\r\nwithout the aid of a hand lens. They are wingless and feed principally\r\non the underside of the leaves along the midrib. Colonies of them\r\nproduce webs in which molted skins and eggs may be found. The life cycle\r\nof mites is very short and several generations occur each year. Large\r\npopulations may develop during the late summer and fall.\r\n\r\nThe use of certain insecticides for the control of the pecan nut\r\ncasebearer or bordeaux mixture for scab control frequently contributes\r\nto increases in mite populations later in the season.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Mites may be controlled in three ways when damaging\r\ninfestations develop. An application of 2 pounds of wettable sulfur per\r\n100 gallons of water may be made; 6 pounds of wettable sulfur per 100\r\ngallons of water may be added to the spray applied for the control of\r\nthe nut casebearer; and repeated applications of zineb included in a\r\nregular spray schedule for pecan scab control will effectively control\r\nmites. However, a single application of zineb is not effective[7].\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN LEAF CASEBEARER\r\n\r\nOn occasion, this insect, _Acrobasis juglandis_ (LeB.), develops to\r\ndamaging numbers and causes economic injury. Early in the spring the\r\nlarva feeds on unfolding leaves and buds. It may prevent leaf\r\ndevelopment for weeks, resulting in a greatly decreased yield of nuts.\r\n\r\nThe adult is a dark gray moth marked with brown. Its forewings, which\r\nhave a spread of about two-thirds inch, are gray with black blotches.\r\nThere is a reddish mark near the base of the forewings.\r\n\r\nThe immature larva is brown, but changes to dark green as it develops to\r\na length of one-half inch. It has a shiny, brownish black head and is\r\nenclosed in a gray case which completely covers the body and is borne in\r\na position nearly perpendicular to the leaf on which the larva is\r\nfeeding.\r\n\r\nThe pecan leaf casebearer overwinters as an immature larva in a\r\nhibernaculum around a bud. It emerges in late March or early April as\r\nthe buds open. The larvae mature in April, May and June and transform\r\ninto pupae within their gray cases, Figure 15. The moths are present\r\nfrom May until early August. Eggs are deposited during this period on\r\nthe underside of the leaves. The larvae which hatch from these eggs\r\ndevelop slowly, and do not attain a length of more than one-sixteenth\r\ninch during that season. They construct little winding cases in which\r\nthey live. Their feeding produces irregular blotches on the leaf\r\nsurface, Figure 16. Before the leaves drop in the fall, the larvae\r\nmigrate to the buds, and construct their overwintering hibernacula. Only\r\none generation is completed each year.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Control of this insect is accomplished by spraying for the\r\npecan nut casebearer. See spray schedule, page 4. The insecticides\r\nrecommended for nut casebearer control also reduce infestations of the\r\nleaf casebearer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 15. Overwintered larvae of pecan leaf\r\n    casebearer in their cases.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 16. Summer injury to the leaves by the pecan\r\n    leaf casebearer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN PHYLLOXERA\r\n\r\nThe pecan phylloxera, _Phylloxera devastatris_ Perg., and the pecan leaf\r\nphylloxera, _P. notabilis_ Perg., produce galls on the new growth of\r\npecans. Leaves, twigs and nuts may be affected.\r\n\r\nThe galls are conspicuous swellings, Figure 17, which attain a size of\r\nfrom one-tenth to 1 inch in diameter. They are caused by a soft-bodied\r\ninsect which is closely related to aphids.\r\n\r\nThe winter is passed in the egg stage in crevices in the bark. In the\r\nspring, the egg hatches and the tiny nymph feeds on the tender, young\r\ngrowth, apparently secreting a substance which stimulates the plant\r\ntissues to develop into galls.\r\n\r\nAfter the nymph reaches maturity, a number of eggs are deposited inside\r\nthe gall. The young nymphs of the succeeding generation develop within\r\nthe gall, which splits open in 1 to 3 weeks, liberating them. Several\r\ngenerations follow during the summer and fall, as long as there is fresh\r\nyoung growth on the tree. From 4 to 5 weeks are required for each\r\ngeneration[4].\r\n\r\n_Control._—The dormant oil spray recommended for obscure scale control\r\nwill prevent the development of phylloxera. If dormant oil is not\r\napplied, use 2 pints of nicotine sulfate plus 6 pounds of soap; 3 pounds\r\nof 25 percent malathion wettable powder; or two and a half pounds of 10\r\npercent gamma isomer BHC wettable powder per 100 gallons of water when\r\nthe leaves are one-third grown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWFLIES\r\n\r\nSawfly larvae, _Periclista_ sp. and others, feed on the foliage of\r\npecans during April and early May. The larvae, which are light green,\r\nchew holes in the leaves. Usually the midrib and veins are left intact,\r\ngiving the leaflets a lacy appearance, Figure 18.\r\n\r\nThe adults closely resemble wasps, except that they are not\r\n“wasp-waisted.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Developing galls of the pecan phylloxera.\r\n    Note the open gall on the lower leaf.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—The larvae may be controlled with an application of 2 pounds\r\nof 50 percent DDT wettable powder or 1 pound of 25 percent parathion\r\nwettable powder per 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 18. Sawfly injury to pecan foliage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY BEETLES\r\n\r\nMany species of May beetles may damage pecans early in the spring. The\r\nbeetles appear only at night and spend the day concealed beneath the\r\nsurface of the soil. They feed on the young leaves and prevent the\r\nfoliage from developing.\r\n\r\nBeetles of the most common species are one-half to three-fourths inch\r\nlong and shiny dark brown. They are attracted to lights and are observed\r\ncommonly on porches or screen doors at night. The larvae are the\r\ngrubworms, or white grubs, which feed in the soil on the roots of many\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe female beetle deposits eggs in the soil, where the larva develops.\r\nMost species require two summers for the larva to mature. Pupation is\r\naccomplished in a cell which is constructed in the ground in the fall of\r\nthe second year. The beetles emerge the following spring. Both larvae\r\nand adults may be found in the soil during the winter.\r\n\r\n_Control._—May beetles are usually a problem in orchards which are not\r\ncultivated because the larvae feed on the roots of the sod cover.\r\nCultivation of the orchard periodically will reduce the food supply of\r\nthe grubs, and smaller infestations of adults will appear the following\r\nyear. Where cultivation is not feasible, sprays will control the adults.\r\nApply 2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder; 4 pounds of lead\r\narsenate; or 1 pound of 25 percent parathion wettable powder per 100\r\ngallons of water when damage by this insect is severe[9].\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN CIGAR CASEBEARER\r\n\r\nThe pecan cigar casebearer, _Coleophora caryaefoliella_ (Clem), may be\r\ndamaging in some years. The larva feeds on the leaves, producing tiny\r\nholes. It constructs a light brown, cigar-shaped case about one-fourth\r\ninch in length which encases it throughout development.\r\n\r\n_Control._—The spray applied for control of the nut casebearer will\r\nusually prevent significant injury by the cigar casebearer. See spray\r\nschedule, page 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL WEBWORM\r\n\r\nThe webs produced by the fall webworm, _Hyphantria cunea_ (Drury), are\r\nfamiliar to everyone. Leaves are eaten by the larvae which live in\r\nloosely woven, dirty white webs, Figure 19.\r\n\r\nThe adult is a white moth which may have black or brown spots on the\r\nforewing. Its wings have a span of about 1 inch.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are pale yellow spotted with black. They attain a length of 1\r\ninch when full grown and are covered with long black and white hairs.\r\n\r\nThe insect overwinters as a pupa in lightly woven cocoons in debris on\r\nthe soil or under the bark. In the spring the adults emerge and lay\r\nmasses of greenish white eggs on the leaves. The caterpillars which\r\nhatch from the eggs feed on the leaves in colonies under webs which they\r\nconstruct. After feeding for a month to 6 weeks, the larvae crawl down\r\nthe tree and pupate in loose cocoons in debris, under bark, or in loose\r\nsoil. Adults appear during the summer and deposit eggs for the second\r\ngeneration. The larvae of this generation feed extensively until fall,\r\ncrawl down the tree and pupate for the winter.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Light infestations on a few trees can be eliminated by\r\npruning out the affected branches and burning them. If this method of\r\ncontrol is not practicable, the trees should be sprayed with 2 pounds of\r\n50 percent DDT wettable powder; 1 pound of 25 percent parathion wettable\r\npowder; or 3 pounds of lead arsenate per 100 gallons of water[9].\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 19. Web of the fall webworm on a pecan limb.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT CATERPILLAR\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer, the walnut caterpillars, _Datana\r\nintegerrima_ G. & R. and others, may strip the leaves from branches or\r\nentire small trees. The adult is a moth with a wingspan of 1½ to 2\r\ninches. The forewings are light brown with darker wavy lines. The\r\nhindwings are lighter in color without lines.\r\n\r\nThe immature larva is reddish brown with narrow yellowish lines that\r\nextend the length of the body. The full-grown larva is almost black with\r\ntwo grayish lines on the back and two on the sides. Many long, soft gray\r\nhairs are distributed over the body.\r\n\r\nThis insect overwinters in the pupal stage in the soil. The adult\r\nemerges in the spring and deposits eggs in masses on the underside of\r\nthe leaves, Figure 20. The larvae feed in colonies on the leaves for\r\nabout 3 weeks. At periodic intervals, the groups of larvae move to the\r\ntrunk to molt and, after shedding their skins, they return to the leaves\r\nto feed until the next molt. They do not encase themselves in webs.\r\nThere are two generations each year, the first appearing in late spring\r\nand early summer, the second in later summer and fall. Larvae of the\r\nsecond generation complete development and crawl down to pupate in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n_Control._—When these insects become abundant enough to defoliate\r\nportions of the tree, they may be controlled by applying a spray\r\ncontaining 2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder; 3 pounds of lead\r\narsenate; or 1 pound of 25 percent parathion wettable powder per 100\r\ngallons of water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 20. Walnut caterpillar adults and egg mass on\r\n    a pecan leaflet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN CATOCALA\r\n\r\nSeveral species of catocalas, Figure 21, among them _Catocala maestosa_\r\nHlst., may strip the leaves of pecans in the spring leaving only the\r\nmidribs. The caterpillars are very dark gray and attain a length of\r\nabout 3 inches when full grown. They are very active when disturbed and\r\nmove with a looping motion. Both the caterpillars and the moths are well\r\ncamouflaged. When they rest on the trees during the day, their color so\r\nharmonizes with the color of the bark that they are frequently\r\nindistinguishable.\r\n\r\n_Control._—One application of 2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder\r\nper 100 gallons of water controls this pest. Although the majority of\r\ncatocala larvae reach maturity before the time to spray for the nut\r\ncasebearer, a number of them will be killed when the recommended spray\r\nis applied for the latter insect.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN SPITTLEBUG\r\n\r\nIn the spring and early summer a number of buds and small nuts may be\r\ncovered with foamy white masses. Inside these masses are several small\r\ninsects called spittlebugs, _Clastoptera obtusa_ (Say). The white froth\r\nis produced probably to maintain an artificial high humidity, which is\r\nrequired for development. The adults resemble leafhoppers and fly\r\nactively during the summer.\r\n\r\nThis insect has not been known to cause any significant injury on pecans\r\nin Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECAN BUD MOTH\r\n\r\nThe pecan bud moth, _Gretchena bolliana_ (Sling.), damages nursery stock\r\nand freshly top-worked pecans. The greenish larvae feed in the axils of\r\nthe newly set buds and in the terminals of young trees, causing\r\nextensive branching. There are several generations each year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 21. Moth of the pecan catocala.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—This insect may be controlled by applying a spray containing\r\n2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIG GIRDLER\r\n\r\nThe adult twig girdler, _Oncideres cingulata_ (Say) (_O. texana_ of some\r\nauthors), girdles twigs and branches, weakening them so that they fall\r\noff or die on the tree, Figure 22. This insect is active during the late\r\nsummer and early fall. Many twigs may be found on the ground under a\r\nseverely infested tree. Secondary branching may occur and the number of\r\nbearing twigs is reduced.\r\n\r\nThe twig borer is a grayish brown beetle one-half to five-eighths inch\r\nin length with a broad gray band over the middle of the wing covers. Its\r\nhead is reddish brown and bears a pair of long antennae, which extend\r\nbeyond the abdomen on the male.\r\n\r\nThe larva is a white legless grub about three-fourths inch long when it\r\nreaches maturity.\r\n\r\nThis insect overwinters as a partially grown larva in a twig on the tree\r\nor ground. It develops rapidly in the spring feeding in the twig.\r\nFollowing pupation, the adult emerges in late August or early September.\r\nThe female systematically girdles twigs and deposits eggs in the severed\r\nportion since the larva is unable to develop in healthy sapwood. The\r\neggs hatch in a few weeks into larvae which remain small until the\r\nfollowing spring when they complete development, pupate and emerge as\r\nadults in the late summer and fall. There is one generation annually,\r\nalthough some individuals require 2 years to mature[1].\r\n\r\n_Control._—Infestations may be reduced by removing girdled branches from\r\nthe trees and the ground and burning them.\r\n\r\nChemical control is also effective. The trees should be sprayed with 4\r\npounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of water when\r\nthe first injured branches are observed in late August or early\r\nSeptember. Two or three applications at 2-week intervals may be required\r\nfor most effective control[9].\r\n\r\n\r\nRED-SHOULDERED SHOT-HOLE BORER\r\n\r\nThe red-shouldered shot-hole borer, _Xylobiops basilare_ (Say), and\r\nother shot-hole borers also injure trees in a devitalized condition. The\r\nlarvae feed in wood, pupate and emerge as adults through round holes\r\nabout one-eighth inch in diameter in the bark. Many of these holes may\r\nbe observed in close proximity to each other.\r\n\r\n_Control._—Since this insect feeds on dying or dead wood, prunings and\r\ndead limbs should be removed from the orchard and burned.\r\n\r\nAdequate fertilizer and water will keep trees in a healthy condition and\r\nprevent injury by this pest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLATHEADED BORERS\r\n\r\nThe flatheaded apple tree borer, _Chrysobothris femorata_ (Oliv.), and\r\nother species of flatheaded borers attack unhealthy or recently\r\ntransplanted pecan trees by burrowing in the bark and sapwood of the\r\nlarge branches and trunk. Their presence is indicated by the appearance\r\nof darkened, depressed areas in the bark from which traces of frass may\r\nprotrude. When these portions of the bark are removed, shallow winding\r\nburrows packed with sawdust may be observed. The burrows usually are on\r\nthe sunny side of the trunk or branch, but may extend completely around\r\nand penetrate the wood to a depth of 2 inches. Young trees may be\r\ngirdled by this insect.\r\n\r\nThe adult beetle is about one-half inch long, broad and blunt at the\r\nhead end and tapering to a point posteriorly. Its wing covers, which\r\nhave a metallic sheen, are dark colored and corrugated.\r\n\r\nThe larva, or borer, which is legless and yellowish white, attains a\r\nlength of 1¼ inches when full grown. Immediately behind the head is a\r\nbroad, flattened expanded area from which the insect takes its name.\r\n\r\nThe winter is passed by larvae in varying stages of development within\r\nthe tree. In the spring, they change to pupae in their burrows, emerging\r\nas adults during the spring and summer. The female beetles deposit their\r\neggs in cracks or bruises in the bark. The larvae which hatch from these\r\neggs feed during the remainder of the season and pass the winter. There\r\nis only one generation each year.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 22. Adult twig girdler and characteristic\r\n    injury to twig.]\r\n\r\n_Control._—The beetles are attracted to trees or areas of trees in a\r\ndevitalized condition, induced by transplanting, drouth, sunscald,\r\nbruises or poor growing conditions. The trees must be kept in a healthy,\r\nvigorous condition by proper fertilization and watering. On young or\r\ntransplanted trees, wrapping the trunks in early spring before the\r\nadults appear is the only effective control known for these insects.\r\nInjury can be prevented by thoroughly wrapping the entire trunk from\r\nground level to the branches with heavy paper or other wrapping\r\nmaterial. The wrapping should be tied securely with twine and should be\r\nmaintained on the tree for 2 years. Regular observations should be made\r\nto see that the twine does not girdle the tree.\r\n\r\nIn older trees, the borers can be removed with a sharp knife. Care\r\nshould be taken to injure as little of the healthy wood as possible. If\r\nthe wound is extensive, it should be trimmed and then painted with a\r\ncommercial tree paint or with a mixture of one part creosote and three\r\nparts coal tar. Dead and dying limbs and trees should be removed from\r\nthe orchard each year and burned before the following spring. If they\r\nare not burned, the borers in them may mature and re-infest surrounding\r\ntrees. Commercial tree borer preparations are of little value in\r\ncontrolling this insect.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSCURE SCALE\r\n\r\nThe obscure scale, _Chrysomphalus obscurus_ (Comst.), is a pest of\r\nconsiderable importance, particularly in the more arid portions of the\r\nState. The tiny insect under its scale covering sucks the sap from the\r\nlimbs and branches, causing them to lose their leaves and die back from\r\nthe tips. The tree is so devitalized by the feeding of this insect that\r\nit is made vulnerable to attack by wood borers.\r\n\r\nThe scale covering over a full-grown female is about one-eighth inch\r\nlong and is usually dark gray, and closely resembles the bark of the\r\ntree. Infested limbs appear to have had wood ashes sprinkled over them,\r\nFigure 23. Numerous pits appear in the bark where the insects feed,\r\nproducing a roughened appearance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 23. Severe infestation of obscure scale on a\r\n    pecan twig.]\r\n\r\nThe winter is passed by the female scales under their coverings on the\r\nbark. Eggs laid in the spring hatch into tiny, salmon-colored crawlers\r\nwhich move about for a short time, then settle down and insert their\r\nbeaks. While they are feeding, a scale covering develops which is made\r\nup of secreted wax and cast skins.\r\n\r\nThe females never move again from the spot they have selected, but the\r\nadult males develop wings and emerge from their scale coverings to mate\r\nwith the females. Only one generation is produced each year.\r\n\r\n_Control._—When damaging populations develop, a spray application of 3½\r\ngallons of 97 percent miscible dormant oil per 100 gallons of water\r\nduring the dormant season will keep this pest under control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              _Application of Fungicides and Insecticides_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen possible, fungicides for disease control and insecticides for\r\ninsect control should be combined in the spray tank and applied to the\r\ntrees in one operation. The spray materials should be applied evenly and\r\nthoroughly to all the leaf and nut surfaces to provide a chemical\r\nbarrier to disease organisms and insects. Do not neglect the tops of the\r\ntrees. Diseases and insects can harbor and multiply in all unsprayed\r\nareas of the tree.\r\n\r\nThorough coverage with spray materials is essential for effective\r\ncontrol. As a guideline, apply approximately 1 gallon of spray mixture\r\nfor each foot of tree height. Apply 20 gallons to a 20-foot tree and 40\r\ngallons to a 40-foot tree, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Spray Equipment_\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious types of spray machines for application of fungicides and\r\ninsecticides to pecan trees are available. The spray machines employ\r\neither a high pressure hydraulic pump, high pressure centrifugal pump or\r\nlow pressure high air velocity systems. All the machines are portable\r\nand are equipped with a gasoline engine or operate from a truck or\r\ntractor power takeoff shaft.\r\n\r\nFor pecan spraying, a tank having a minimum capacity of 300 gallons is\r\ndesirable. The pump should deliver 20 to 30 gallons per minute and\r\nmaintain a pressure of 400 to 600 pounds per square inch while\r\noperating. A spray gun which is adjustable to produce a mist spray for\r\nspraying small trees or the lower canopy of large trees and a narrow\r\nstream that will reach the tops of tall trees is essential.\r\n\r\nFor safety and durability high pressure rubber hose having an inside\r\ndiameter of three-fourths inch should be used with all high pressure\r\nspray machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Literature Cited_\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Bilsing, S.
