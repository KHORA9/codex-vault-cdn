These wandering\r\nglobes are called the _Planets_, who, at different distances, and\r\nin different periods, perform their revolutions from West to East, in\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n        1. ☿ _Mercury_ is nearest to the Sun of all the planets,\r\n      and performs its course in about three months. 2. ♀ _Venus_\r\n      in about seven months and a half. 3. ♁ The _Earth_ in a year.\r\n      4. ♂ _Mars_ in about two years. 5. ♃ _Jupiter_ in twelve.\r\n      And lastly, ♄ _Saturn_, whose[1]_Orbit_ includes all the\r\n      rest, spends almost 30 years in one revolution round the Sun.\r\n      The distances of the Planets from the Sun are nearly in the\r\n      same proportion as they are represented in _Plate_ 1. _viz._\r\n      Supposing the distance of the Earth from the Sun to be divided\r\n      into 10 equal parts; that of _Mercury_ will be about 4 of these\r\n      parts; of _Venus_ 7; of _Mars_ 15; of _Jupiter_ 52; and\r\n      that of _Saturn_ 95.\r\n\r\nThe Characters placed before the names of the Planets, are for\r\nbrevity’s sake commonly made use of by Astronomers, instead of the\r\nwords at length, as ♀, for _Venus_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 1.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM Or the Orbits of the Planets _according to their mean\r\ndistances from the Sun_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nodes._]\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the Planets are not all in the same plane, but variously\r\ninclined to one another; so that supposing one of them to coincide with\r\nthe above scheme, the others will have one half above, and the other\r\nhalf below it; intersecting one another in a line passing through the\r\nSun. The plane of the Earth’s orbit is called the _Ecliptic_; and this\r\nthe astronomers make the standard to which the planes of the other\r\norbits are judged to incline. The right line passing thro’ the Sun, and\r\nthe common intersection of the plane of the orbit of any planet and the\r\nEcliptic, is called the _Line of the Nodes_ of that planet; and the\r\npoints themselves, wherein the orbit cuts the Ecliptic are called the\r\n_Nodes_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Excentricity._]\r\n\r\nThe inclinations of the orbits of the Planets to the plane of the\r\necliptic, are as follows, _viz._ the orbit of _Mercury_ makes an\r\nangle with it of almost 7 degrees; that of _Venus_ something above\r\n3⅓ degrees; of _Mars_ a little less than 2 degrees; of _Jupiter_, 1⅓\r\ndegree; and of _Saturn_, about 2½ degrees. The orbits of the Planets\r\nare not circles, but ellipses or ovals. What an ellipsis is, may be\r\neasily understood from the following description. Imagine two small\r\npegs fixed upright on any plane, and suppose them tied with the ends\r\nof a thread somewhat longer than their distance from one another: Now\r\nif a pin be placed in the double of the thread and turned quite round\r\n(always stretching the thread with the same force) the curved described\r\nby this motion is an _Ellipsis_. The two points where the pegs stood,\r\n(about which the thread was turned) are called the _foci_ of that\r\nellipsis; and if, without changing the length of the thread, we alter\r\nthe position of the pegs, we shall then have an ellipsis of a different\r\nkind from the former; and the nearer the _focus’s_ are together, the\r\nnearer will the curve described be to a circle; until at last, the two\r\n_focus’s_ coincide, and then the pin in the doubling of the thread\r\nwill describe a perfect circle. The orbits of all the Planets have the\r\nSun in one of their _focus’s_, and half the distance between the two\r\n_focus’s_ is called the _Excentricity_ of the orbits. This excentricity\r\nis different in all the planets, but in most of them so small, that in\r\nlittle schemes or instruments, made to represent the planetary orbits,\r\nit need not be considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Primary Planets._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Secondary Planets._]\r\n\r\nThe six Planets above-mentioned, are called _Primaries_, or _Primary\r\nPlanets_; but besides these, there are ten other lesser Planets, which\r\nare called _Secondaries_, _Moons_, or _Satellites_. These moons always\r\naccompany their respective primaries, and perform their Revolutions\r\nround them, whilst both together are also carried round the Sun. Of the\r\nsix Primary Planets, there are but three, as far as observation can\r\nassure us, that have these attendants, _viz._ the _Earth_, _Jupiter_,\r\nand _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is attended by the _Moon_, who performs her revolution in\r\nabout 27⅓ Days, at the distance of about 30 Diameters of the Earth from\r\nit; and once a Year is carried round the Sun along with the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jupiter’s_ four Moons.]\r\n\r\n_Jupiter_ has four _Moons_, or _Satellites_; the _first_, or innermost,\r\nperforms its revolution in about one Day, and 18½ Hours, at the\r\ndistance of 5⅔ Semidiameters of _Jupiter_, from his Center; the\r\n_second_ revolves about _Jupiter_ in 3 Days, 13 Hours, at the distance\r\nof 9 of his Semidiameters; the _third_ in 7 Days, and 4 Hours, at the\r\ndistance of 14⅓ Semidiameters; the _fourth_, and _outermost_, performs\r\nits course in the space of 16 Days, 17 Hours; and is distant from\r\n_Jupiter’s_ center, 25⅓ of his Semidiameters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Saturn_ has five Moons.]\r\n\r\n_Saturn_ has no less than five _Satellites_; the _first_, or innermost,\r\nrevolves about him in 1 Day, and 21 Hours, at the distance of 4⅜\r\nSemidiameters of ♄, from his center; the _second_ compleats his\r\nperiod in 2¾ Days, at the distance of 5³/₅ of his Semidiameters;\r\nthe _third_, in about 4½ Days, at the distance of 8 Semidiameters;\r\nthe _fourth_ performs its course in about 16 Days, at the distance\r\nof 18 Semidiameters; the _fifth_, and outermost, takes 79⅓ Days, to\r\nfinish his course, and is 54 Semidiameters of _Saturn_ distant from\r\nhis center. The Satellites, as well as their primaries, perform their\r\nrevolutions from _West_ to _East_: The planes of the Orbits of the\r\nSatellites of the same Planet are variously inclined to one another,\r\nand consequently are inclined to the plane of the Orbit of their\r\nprimary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Saturn’s_ Ring.]\r\n\r\nBesides these attendants, _Saturn_ is encompassed with a thin plain\r\nRing, that does no where touch his body; The diameter of this Ring is\r\nto the diameter of _Saturn_, as 9 to 4; and the void space between\r\nthe Ring and the body of _Saturn_ is equal to the breadth of the Ring\r\nitself; so that in some situations the Heavens may be seen between the\r\nRing and his body. This surprizing phænomenon of _Saturn_’s Ring, is a\r\nmodern discovery; neither were the Satellites of _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_\r\nknown to the ancients. The _Jovial_ Planets were first discovered by\r\nthe famous _Italian_ philosopher _Galilæus_, by a telescope which he\r\nfirst invented; and the celebrated _Cassini_, the _French_ king’s\r\nastronomer, was the first that saw all the Satellites of _Saturn_;\r\nwhich by reason of their great distances from the Sun, and the\r\nsmallness of their own bodies, cannot be seen by us, but by the help of\r\nvery good glasses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Annual Motion._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Diurnal Motion._]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the primary Planets round the Sun (as also of the\r\nSatellites round their respective primaries) is called their _Annual\r\nMotion_; because they have one Year, or alteration of Seasons compleat,\r\nin one of these revolutions. Besides this annual motion, four of the\r\nPlanets, _viz. Venus_, the _Earth_, _Mars_, and _Jupiter_ revolve about\r\ntheir own _Axis_, from _West_ to _East_; and this is called their\r\n_Diurnal Motion_. For by this rotation, each point of their surfaces is\r\ncarried successively towards or from the Sun, who always illuminates\r\nthe hemisphere which is next to him, the other remaining obscure; and\r\nwhile any place is in the hemisphere, illuminated by the Sun, it is\r\n_Day_, but when it is carried to the obscure hemisphere, it becomes\r\n_Night_; and so continues, until by this rotation the said place is\r\nagain enlightened by the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diurnal Motion of the ♁, ♀, ♂ and ♃.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ☉ and ☽ likewise turn round their Axis.]\r\n\r\nThe _Earth_ performs its revolution round its axis in 23 Hours, 56\r\nMinutes;[2]_Venus_, in 24 Days, 8 Hours; _Mars_, in 24 Hours, and 40\r\nMinutes; and _Jupiter_ moves round his own axis in 9 Hours, and 56\r\nMinutes. The Sun also is found to turn round his axis from West to\r\nEast, in 27 Days: And the Moon, which is nearest to us of all the\r\nPlanets, revolves about her axis in a Month, or in the same space of\r\ntime that she turns round the Earth; so that the _Lunarians_ have but 1\r\nDay throughout the Year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planets are Opaque and Globular.]\r\n\r\nI. The Planets are all _Opaque_ bodies, having no light but what they\r\nborrow from the Sun; for that side of them which is next towards the\r\nSun, has always been observed to be illuminated, in what position\r\nsoever they be; but the opposite side, which the Solar rays do not\r\nreach, remains dark and obscure; whence it is evident that they have\r\nno light but what proceeds from the Sun; for if they had, all parts of\r\nthem would be lucid, without any darkness or shadow. The Planets are\r\nlikewise proved to be _Globular_; because let what part soever of them\r\nbe turned towards the Sun, its boundary, or the line separating that\r\npart from the opposite, always appears to be circular; which could not\r\nhappen, if they were not globular.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Planets turn round the Sun.]\r\n\r\nII. That the Earth is placed betwixt the Orbs of _Mars_ and _Venus_,\r\nand that ☿, ♀, ♂, ♃ and ♄, do all turn round the Sun, is proved from\r\nobservations as follow:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Plate 2. Fig. 1. 2._]\r\n\r\n1. Whenever _Venus_ is in conjunction with the Sun, that is, when she\r\nis in the same direction from the Earth, or towards the same part of\r\nthe Heavens the Sun is in; she either appears with a bright and round\r\nface, like a Full Moon, or else disappears: Or, if she is visible,\r\nshe appears horned, like a new Moon; which phænomena could never\r\nhappen if ♀ did not turn round the Sun, and was not betwixt him and\r\nthe Earth: For since all the Planets borrow their light from the Sun,\r\nit is necessary that ♀’s lucid face should be towards the Sun; and\r\nwhen she appears fully illuminated, she shews the same face to the\r\nSun and Earth; and at that time she must be above or beyond the Sun;\r\nfor in no other position could her illuminated face be seen from the\r\nEarth. Farther, when she disappears, or if visible, appears horned;\r\nthat face of her’s which is towards the Sun is either wholly turned\r\nfrom the Earth, or only a small part of it can be seen by the Earth;\r\nand in this case she must of necessity be betwixt us and the Sun. Let\r\nS be the _Sun_, T the _Earth_, and V _Venus_, having the same face\r\npresented both towards the _Sun_ and _Earth_; here it is plain that\r\nthe Sun is betwixt us and _Venus_ and therefore we must either place\r\n_Venus_ in an Orbit round the Sun, and likewise betwixt him and us, as\r\nin _Fig. 1._ or else we must make the Sun to move round the Earth in\r\nan Orbit within that of _Venus_, as in _Fig. 2._ Again, after _Venus_\r\ndisappears, or becomes horned, at her[3] ☌ with the ☉, she then must\r\nbe betwixt us and the Sun, and must move either in an Orbit round the\r\nSun and betwixt us and him, as in _Fig. 1._ or else round the Earth,\r\nand betwixt us and the Sun, as in _Fig. 2._ But _Venus_ cannot move\r\nsometimes within the Sun’s Orbit, and sometimes without it, as we must\r\nsuppose if she moves round the Earth; therefore it is plain that her\r\nmotion is round the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why _Venus_ is always either our Morning or Evening Star.]\r\n\r\nBesides the forgoing, there is another argument to prove that _Venus_\r\nturns round the Sun in an Orbit that is within the Earth’s, because she\r\nis always observed to keep near the Sun, and in the same quarter of the\r\nHeavens that he is in, never receding from him more than about ⅛ of a\r\nwhole circle; and therefore she can never come in opposition to him;\r\nwhich would necessarily happen, did she perform her course round the\r\nEarth either in a longer or shorter time than a Year. And this is the\r\nreason why _Venus_ is never to be seen near midnight, but always either\r\nin the Morning or Evening, and at most not above three or four Hours\r\nbefore Sun-rising or after Sun-setting. From the time of ♀’s superior\r\nconjunction (or when she is above the Sun) she is more Easterly than\r\nthe Sun, and therefore sets later, and is seen after Sun-setting; and\r\nthen she is commonly called the _Evening Star_. But from the time of\r\nher inferior conjunction, ’till she comes again to the superior, she\r\nthen appears more Westerly than the Sun, and is only to be seen in the\r\nmorning before Sun-rising, and is then called the _Morning Star_.\r\n\r\nAfter the same manner we prove that _Mercury_ turns round the Sun, for\r\nhe always keeps in the Sun’s neighbourhood, and never recedes from him\r\nso far as _Venus_ does; and therefore the Orbit of ☿ must lie within\r\nthat of ♀; and on the account of his nearness to the Sun, he can seldom\r\nbe seen without a Telescope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Orbit of _Mars_ includes the Earth’s.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 3._]\r\n\r\n_Mars_ is observed to come in opposition, and likewise to have all\r\nother aspects with the Sun; he always preserves a round, full, and\r\nbright face, except when he is near his quadrate aspect, when he\r\nappears somewhat gibbous, like the Moon three or four Days before or\r\nafter the full: Therefore the Orbit of ♂ must include the Earth within\r\nit, and also the Sun; for if he was betwixt the Sun and us at the\r\ntime of his inferior conjunction, he would either quite disappear, or\r\nappear horned, as _Venus_ and the Moon do in that position. Let S be\r\nthe _Sun_, T the _Earth_, and A P _Mars_, both in his conjunction and\r\nopposition to the Sun, and in both positions full; and B C _Mars_ at\r\nhis quadratures, when he appears somewhat gibbous from the Earth at\r\nT. ’Tis plain hence, that the Orbit of _Mars_ does include the Earth,\r\notherwise he could not come in opposition to the Sun; and that it\r\nlikewise includes the Sun, else he could appear full at his conjunction.\r\n\r\n_Mars_ when he is in opposition to the Sun, looks almost seven\r\ntimes larger in diameter than when he is in conjunction with him,\r\nand therefore must needs be almost seven times nearer to us in one\r\nposition than in the other; for the apparent magnitudes of far distant\r\nobjects increase or decrease in proportion to their distances from\r\nus: But _Mars_ keeps always nearly at the same distance from the Sun;\r\ntherefore it is plain that it is not the Earth, but the Sun, that is\r\nthe center of his motion.\r\n\r\nIt is proved in the same way, that _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_ have both\r\nthe Sun and the Earth within their Orbits, and that the Sun, and not\r\nthe Earth, is the center of their motions; altho’ the disproportion of\r\nthe distances from the Earth is not so great in _Jupiter_, as it is in\r\n_Mars_, nor so great in _Saturn_, as it is in _Jupiter_, by reason that\r\nthey are at a much greater distance from the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Inferior_ and _Superior Planets_.]\r\n\r\nWe have now shewn that all the Planets turn round the Sun, and that\r\n_Mercury_ and _Venus_ are included between him and the Earth, whence\r\nthey are called the _Inferior Planets_, and that the Earth is placed\r\nbetween the Orbits of _Mars_ and _Venus_, and therefore included within\r\nthe Orbits of _Mars_, _Jupiter_, and _Saturn_, whence they are called\r\nthe _Superior Planets_: And since the Earth is in the middle of these\r\nmoveable bodies, and is of the same nature with them, we may conclude\r\nthat she has the same sort of motions; but that she turns round the Sun\r\nis proved thus:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earth does not stand still, but turns round the Sun.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 4._]\r\n\r\nAll the Planets seen from the Earth appear to move very unequally,\r\nas sometimes to go faster, at other times slower; sometimes to go\r\nbackwards, and sometimes to be stationary, or not to move at all; which\r\ncould not happen if the Earth stood still. Let S be the Sun, T the\r\nEarth, the great circle A B C D the Orbit of _Mars_, and the numbers 1,\r\n2, 3, _&c._ its equable motion round the Sun; the correspondent numbers\r\n1, 2, 3, _&c._ in the circle _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, the motion of _Mars_,\r\nas it would be seen from the Earth. It is plain from this Figure,\r\nthat if the Earth stood still, the motion of _Mars_, will be always\r\nprogressive, (tho’ sometimes very unequal;) but since observations\r\nprove the contrary, it necessarily follows, that the Earth turns round\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Annual and Diurnal Motions of the Planets, how computed.]\r\n\r\nThe annual periods of the Planets round the Sun are determined by\r\ncarefully observing the length of time since their departure from\r\na certain point in the Heavens, (or from a fix’d Star) until they\r\narrive to the same again. By these sort of observations the ancients\r\ndetermined the periodical revolutions of the Planets round the\r\nSun, and were so exact in their computations, as to be capable of\r\npredicting Eclipses of the Sun and Moon. But since the invention of\r\ntelescopes, astronomical observations are made with greater accuracy;\r\nand of consequence, our tables are far more perfect than those of\r\nthe ancients. And in order to be as exact as possible, astronomers\r\ncompare observations made at a great distance of time from one another,\r\nincluding several periods; by which means, the error that might be in\r\nthe whole, is in each period subdivided into such little parts as to be\r\ninconsiderable. Thus the mean length of a Solar Year is known, even to\r\nSeconds.\r\n\r\nThe Diurnal rotation of the Planets round their axis, was discovered by\r\ncertain spots which appear on the surfaces. These spots appear first\r\nin the margin of the Planet’s disk, (or the edge of their surfaces)\r\nand seem by degrees to creep toward their middle, and so on, going\r\nstill forward, ’till they come to the opposite side or edge of the\r\ndisk, where they set or disappear; and after they have been hid for\r\nthe same space of time, that they were visible, they again appear to\r\nrise in or near the same place, as they did at first, then to creep on\r\nprogressively, taking the same course as they did before. These spots\r\nhave been observed on the surfaces of the _Sun_, _Venus_, _Mars_,\r\nand _Jupiter_; by which means it has been found that these bodies\r\nturn round their own axis, in the times before-mentioned. It is very\r\nprobable that _Mercury_ and _Saturn_ have likewise a motion round their\r\naxis, that all the parts of their surface may alternately enjoy the\r\nlight and heat of the Sun, and receive such changes as are proper and\r\nconvenient for their nature. But by reason of the nearness of ☿ to the\r\nSun, and ♄’s immense distance from him, no observations have hitherto\r\nbeen made whereby their spots (if they have any) could be discovered,\r\nand therefore their Diurnal motions could not be determined. The\r\nDiurnal motion of the Earth is computed from the apparent revolution of\r\nthe Heavens, and of all the Stars round it, in the space of a natural\r\nDay. The Solar spots do not always remain the same, but sometimes old\r\nones vanish, and afterwards others succeed in their room; sometimes\r\nseveral small ones gather together and make one large spot, and\r\nsometimes a large spot is seen to be divided into many small ones. But,\r\nnotwithstanding these changes, they all turn round with the Sun in the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the relative distances of the Planets from the Sun are\r\ndetermined.]\r\n\r\nThe relative distances of the Planets from the Sun, and likewise\r\nfrom each other, are determined by the following methods: First, the\r\ndistance of the two inferior Planets ☿ and ♀ from the Sun, in respect\r\nof the Earth’s distance from him, is had by observing their greatest\r\nElongation from the Sun as they are seen from the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 5. Elongation._]\r\n\r\nThe greatest _Elongation_ of _Venus_ is found by observation to be\r\nabout 48 degrees, which is the angle S T ♀; whence, by the known rules\r\nof Trigonometry, the proportion of S ♀, the mean distance of _Venus_\r\nfrom the Sun to ST, the mean distance of the Earth from him may be\r\neasily found. After the same manner, in the right-angled triangle S T\r\n☿, may be found the distance S ☿ of _Mercury_ from the Sun. And if the\r\nmean distance of the Earth from the Sun S T be made 1000, the mean\r\ndistance of _Venus_ S ♀ from the Sun will be 723; and of _Mercury_ S\r\n☿ 387: And if the Planets moved round the Sun in circles, having him\r\nfor their center, the distances here found would be always their true\r\ndistances: But as they move in Ellipses, their distances from the Sun\r\nwill be sometimes greater, and sometimes less. Their _Excentricities_\r\nare computed to be as follows, _viz._\r\n\r\n                 { _Mercury_ 80 } of the parts\r\n    _Excent._ of { _Venus_    5 } above-mentioned.\r\n                 { _Earth_  169 }\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Heliocentric_ and _Geocentric Place_, what.]\r\n\r\nThe distances of the superior Planets, _viz._ ♂, ♃, and ♄, are found\r\nby comparing their true places, as they are seen from the Sun, with\r\ntheir apparent places, as they are seen from the Earth. Let S be the\r\nSun, the circle ABC the Earth’s orbit, AG a line touching the Earth’s\r\norbit, in which we’ll suppose the superior Planets are seen from the\r\nEarth in the points of their orbits ♂, ♃, ♄; and let DEFGH be a portion\r\nof a great circle in the Heavens, at an infinite distance: Then the\r\nplace of _Mars_ seen from the Sun is D, which is called his true, or\r\n_Heliocentric Place_; but from the Earth, he will be seen in G, which\r\nis called his apparent, or _Geocentric Place_. So likewise _Jupiter_\r\nand _Saturn_ will be seen from the Sun in the points E and F, their\r\nHeliocentric places; but a spectator from the Earth will see them in\r\nthe point of the Heavens G, which is their Geocentric place. The arches\r\nDG, EG, FG, the differences between the true and apparent places of the\r\nSuperior Planets, are called the _Parallaxes_ of the Earth’s annual\r\nOrb, as seen from these Planets. If thro’ the Sun we draw SH parallel\r\nto AG, the angles A ♂ S, A ♃ S, A ♄ S, will be respectively equal to\r\nthe angles D S H, E S H, and F S H; and the angle A G S is equal to\r\nthe angle GSH, whose measure is the arch GH; which therefore will be\r\nthe measure of the angle AGS, the angle under which the semidiameter\r\nA S of the Earth’s orbit, is seen from the Starry Heavens. But this\r\nsemidiameter is nothing in respect of the immense distance of the\r\nHeavens or Fixed Stars; for from thence it would appear under no\r\nsensible angle, but look like a point. And therefore in the Heavens,\r\nthe angle G S H, or the arch G H vanishes; and the Points G and H\r\ncoincide; and the arches D H, E H, F H, may be considered as being\r\nof the same bigness with the arches D G, E G, and F G, which are the\r\nmeasures of the angles A ♂ S, A ♃ S, A ♄ S; which angles are nearly\r\nthe greatest elongation of the Earth from the Sun, if the Earth be\r\nobserved from the respective Planets, when the line G ♄ ♃ ♂ A, touches\r\nthe Earth’s orbit in A. The nearer any of the superior Planets is to\r\nthe Sun, the greater is the Parallax of the annual Orb, or the angle\r\nunder which the semidiameter of the Earth’s orbit is seen from that\r\nPlanet. In _Mars_ the angle ♂ S, (which is the visible elongation of\r\nthe Earth seen from _Mars_, or the Parallax of the annual Orb seen from\r\nthat Planet) is about 42 degrees, and therefore the Earth is always to\r\nthe inhabitants of _Mars_ either their Morning or Evening Star, and\r\nis never seen by them so far distant from the Sun as we see _Venus_.\r\nThe greatest elongation of the Earth seen from _Jupiter_, being nearly\r\nequal to the angle A ♃ S, is about 11 degrees. In _Saturn_ the angle A\r\n♄ S is but 6 degrees, which is not much above ¼ part of the greatest\r\nelongation we observe in _Mercury_. And since _Mercury_ is so rarely\r\nseen by us, probably the astronomers of _Saturn_ (except they have\r\nbetter Optics than we have) have not yet discovered that there is such\r\na body as our Earth in the Universe.\r\n\r\nThe Parallax of the annual Orb, or the greatest elongation of the\r\nEarth’s orbit seen from any of the superior Planets, being given;\r\nthe distance of that Planet from the Sun, in respect of the Earth’s\r\ndistance from him, may be found by the same methods as the distances of\r\nthe inferior Planets were. Thus, to find the distance of _Mars_ from\r\nthe Sun, it will be as the Sine of the angle S ♂ A is to the _Radius_,\r\nso is the distance AS (the distance of the Earth from the Sun) to S\r\n♂, the distance from the Sun to _Mars_. After the same manner the\r\ndistances of _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_ are also found. The mean distance\r\nof the Earth from the Sun being made 1000, the mean distances of the\r\nsuperior Planets from the Sun are, _viz._ the mean distance from the\r\nSun of\r\n\r\n    { ♂ 1524  }                      { 141 }\r\n    { ♃ 5201  } and the Excentricity { 250 }\r\n    { ♄ 9538  }                      { 547 }\r\n\r\nTo which, if you add or subtract their mean distances, we shall have\r\nthe greatest or least distances of those Planets from the Sun.\r\n\r\nThere are other methods by which the relative distances of the\r\nPlanets might be found; but that which hath been here illustrated, is\r\nsufficient to evince the certainty of that Problem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the absolute distances of the Planets from the Sun are\r\ncomputed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parallax_ of the _Earth’s Semidiameter_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 7._]\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only considered the distances of the Planets in\r\nrelation to one another, without determining them by any known measure;\r\nbut in order to find their absolute distances in some determinate\r\nmeasure, there must be something given, whose measure is known. Now\r\nthe circumference of the Earth is divided into 360 degrees, and\r\neach of these degrees into 60 Geographical miles, so that the whole\r\ncircumference contains 21600; and by the known proportion for finding\r\nthe diameter of a circle from its circumference, the Earth’s diameter\r\nwill be found to be 6872 miles, and its semidiameter 3436 miles. The\r\nParallax of the Earth’s semidiameter, or the angle under which it is\r\nseen from a certain Planet, may be found by comparing the true place\r\nof the Planet, as it would be seen from the center of the Earth (which\r\nis known by computation) with its apparent place, as it is seen from\r\nsome point on the Earth’s surface. Let CZA be the Earth, ZC its\r\nsemidiameter, ♁ some Planet, and BHT arch of a great circle in the\r\nHeavens, at an infinite distance. Now the Planet ♁ will appear from the\r\nEarth’s center C, in the point of the Heavens H; but a spectator from\r\nthe point Z upon the Earth’s surface, will see the same object ♁ in the\r\npoint of the Heavens B; and the arch BH the difference, is equal to the\r\nangle B ♁ H = Z ♁ C, the _Parallax_; which being known, the side C ♁\r\nthe distance of the Planet from the center of the Earth, at that time,\r\nmay be easily found. Now if this distance of the Planet from the Earth\r\nbe determined, when the centers of the Sun, the said Planet, and of the\r\nEarth, are in the same right line, we have the absolute distance of the\r\nPlanet’s orbit from the Earth’s in known measure; then it will be, as\r\nthe relative distance betwixt the Earth’s orbit and that of the Planet\r\nis to the relative distance of the said Planet from the Sun; so is the\r\ndistance of the Planet’s orbit from the Earth’s in known measure to the\r\ndistance of the said Planet from the Sun in the same measure: Which\r\nbeing known, the distance of all the other Planets from the Sun may be\r\nfound. For it will be, as the relative distance of any Planet from the\r\nSun, is to its distance from him in a known measure; so is the relative\r\ndistance of any other Planet from him to its distance in the same\r\nmeasure. This may be done by finding the distance of the Planet _Mars_,\r\nwhen he is in opposition to the Sun, after the same manner as we find\r\nthe distance of a tree, or the like, by two stations.\r\n\r\nLet ♂ be _Mars_, D the point on the Earth’s superficies, where _Mars_\r\nis vertical when he is in opposition to the Sun, which may be found\r\nexactly enough by calculation, at which time let an observer, at the\r\npoint Z (whose situation from D must be known) take the altitude of\r\n_Mars_, whose complement will be the angle ♂ ZR; then in the triangle\r\n♂ ZC will be given the angle Z ♂ C, the angle C (whose measure is the\r\narch DZ) and consequently the angle Z ♂ C the Parallax, and also the\r\nside Z C the semidiameter of the Earth; by which we may find C ♂ the\r\ndistance of _Mars_ from the Earth. The extreme nicety required in this\r\nobservation, makes it very difficult to determine the exact distances\r\nof the Planets from the Sun; but the celebrated Dr. _Halley_ has, in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions, shewed us a more certain method for\r\nfinding the distances of the Planets; which is by observing the Transit\r\nof _Venus_ over the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How the Magnitudes of the Planets are determined.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 8._]\r\n\r\nThe eye judgeth of the magnitudes of far distant objects, according\r\nto the quantities of the angles under which they are seen (which are\r\ncalled their apparent magnitudes;) and these angles appear greater\r\nor less in a certain proportion to their distances. Wherefore the\r\ndistances of the Planets from the Earth, and their apparent diameters\r\nbeing given, their true diameters (and from thence their magnitudes)\r\nmay be found. How the distances of the Planets may be found has been\r\nalready shewn; their apparent diameters are found by a telescope,\r\nhaving a machine fix’d to it for measuring of angles, called a\r\nMicrometer. Let BD, or the angle BAD be the apparent diameter of any\r\nPlanet, and AB, or AD, (which by reason of the great distance of the\r\nPlanets in respect of their magnitudes) may be considered as being the\r\ndistance of the said Planet from the observer. Now in the triangle ABD,\r\nhaving the sides AB, AD, given, and the angle, A, we have also the\r\nother angles B and D, (because the Side AB, AD, are equal) whence the\r\nside BD the diameter of the Planet may be easily found by Trigonometry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Moon appears bigger than any of the Planets.]\r\n\r\nFrom hence it appears, that the same body at different distances, will\r\nseem to have very different magnitudes. Thus the diameter BD will\r\nappear from the point E, to be twice as large as from the point A. It\r\nalso follows, that a small body, when at no great distance from us,\r\nmay appear to be equal, or even to exceed another at a great distance,\r\ntho’ immensely bigger. Thus _b d_ appears under the same angle, and\r\nconsequently of the same bigness from the point A, that the line B D\r\ndoth, tho’ one vastly exceeds the other. And this is the reason, why\r\nthe Moon, which is much less than any of the Planets, appears to us\r\nvastly bigger than either of them, and even to equal the Sun himself,\r\nwhich is many thousand times greater in magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe distances of the Planets, and periods round the Sun, their\r\ndiameters and velocities round their own axis, according to modern\r\ncomputations, are as follows:\r\n\r\n              |Revolves about the | Distance in\r\n              |Sun in the space of|    Miles\r\n              |     Y.

Yet they have\r\nnot all the same direction with the Planets, who move from West to\r\nEast, for some of the Comets move from East to West; and their orbits\r\nhave different inclinations to the Earth’s orbit; some inclining\r\nNorthwardly, others Southwardly, much more than any of the Planetary\r\norbits do.\r\n\r\nAltho’ both the Comets and the Planets move in elliptic orbits, yet\r\ntheir motions seem to be vastly different: For the excentricities of\r\nthe Planet’s orbits are so small, that they differ but little from\r\ncircles; but the excentricities of the Comets are so very great, that\r\nthe motions of some of them seem to be almost in right lines, tending\r\ndirectly towards the Sun.\r\n\r\nNow, since the orbits of the Comets are so extremely excentric, their\r\nmotions, when they are in their _Perihelia_, or nearest distance from\r\nthe sun, must be much swifter than when they are in their _Aphelia_,\r\nor farthest distance from him; which is the reason why the Comets make\r\nso short a stay in our system; and when they disappear, are so long in\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the Comets are observed to be very different; some of\r\nthem send forth small beams, like hair, every way round them; others\r\nare seen with a long fiery tail, which is always opposite to the Sun.\r\nTheir magnitudes are also very different, but in what proportion they\r\nexceed each other, it is as yet uncertain. Nor is it probable, that\r\ntheir numbers are yet known, for they have not been observed with due\r\ncare, nor their theories discovered, but of late years. The ancients\r\nwere divided in their opinions concerning them; some imagined that they\r\nwere only a kind of _Meteors_ kindled in our atmosphere, and were there\r\nagain dissipated; others took them to be some ominous prodigies: But\r\nmodern discoveries prove, that they are Worlds subject to the same laws\r\nof motion as the Planets are; and they must be very hard and durable\r\nbodies, else they could not bear the vast heat that some of them, when\r\nthey are in their _Perihelia_, receive from the Sun, without being\r\nutterly consumed. The great Comet which appeared in the year 1680, was\r\nwithin ¹/₆ part of the Sun’s diameter from his surface; and therefore\r\nits heat must be prodigiously intense beyond imagination. And when it\r\nis at its greatest distance from the Sun, the cold must be as rigid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the_ FIXED STARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fixed Stars are at immense distance from us.]\r\n\r\nThe fixed Stars are those bright and shining bodies, which in a clear\r\nnight appear to us every where dispersed through the boundless regions\r\nof space. They are term’d fix’d, because they are found to keep the\r\nsame immutable distance one from another in all ages, without having\r\nany of the motions observed in the Planets. The fixed Stars are all\r\nplaced at such immense distances from us, that the best of telescopes\r\nrepresent them no bigger than points, without having any apparent\r\ndiameters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fixed Stars are luminous bodies like the Sun.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from hence, that all the Stars are luminous bodies, and\r\nshine with their own proper and native light, else they could not be\r\nseen at such a great distance. For the _Satellites_ of _Jupiter_ and\r\n_Saturn_, tho’ they appear under considerable angles through good\r\ntelescopes, yet are altogether invisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The distance from us to the Sun is nothing in comparison of\r\nthe vast distance of the fixed Stars.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance betwixt us and the Sun is vastly large, when\r\ncompared to the diameter of the Earth, yet it is nothing when compared\r\nwith the prodigious distance of the fixed Stars; for the whole diameter\r\nof the Earth’s annual orbit, appears from the nearest fixed Star no\r\nbigger than a point, and the fixed Stars are at least 100,000 times\r\nfarther from us than we are from the Sun; as may be demonstrated from\r\nthe observation of those who have endeavoured to find the Parallax of\r\nthe Earth’s annual Orb, or the angle under which the Earth’s orbit\r\nappears from the fixed Stars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As to appearance, the Earth may be consider’d as being the\r\ncenter of the Heavens.]\r\n\r\nHence it follows, that tho’ we approach nearer to some fixed Stars at\r\none time of the year than we do at the opposite, and that by the whole\r\nlength of the diameter of the Earth’s orbit; yet this distance being\r\nso small in comparison with the distance of the fixed Stars, their\r\nmagnitudes or positions cannot thereby be sensibly altered; therefore\r\nwe may always, without error, suppose ourselves to be in the same\r\ncenter of the Heavens, since we always have the same visible prospect\r\nof the Stars without any alteration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fixed Stars are Suns.]\r\n\r\nIf a spectator was placed as near to any fixed Star, as we are to the\r\nSun, he would there observe a body as big, and every way like, as the\r\nSun appears to us: and our Sun would appear to him no bigger than a\r\nfixed Star: and undoubtedly he would reckon the Sun as one of them in\r\nnumbering the Stars. Wherefore since the Sun differeth nothing from a\r\nfixed Star, the fixed Stars may be reckoned so many Suns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fixed Stars are at vast distance from each other.]\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable to suppose that all the fixed Stars are placed at\r\nthe same distance from us; but it is more probable that they are every\r\nwhere interspersed thro’ the vast indefinite space of the universe; and\r\nthat there may be as great a distance betwixt any two of them, as there\r\nis betwixt our Sun and the nearest fixed Star. Hence it follows, why\r\nthey appear to us of different magnitudes, not because they really are\r\nso, but because they are at different distances from us; those that are\r\nnearest excelling in brightness and lustre those that are most remote,\r\nwho give a fainter light, and appear smaller to the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW and CORRECT GLOBES according to the latest\r\nObservations\r\n\r\nMade and Sold by RICHARD CUSHEE _at the Globe and Sun between St.\r\nDunstans Church & Chancery Lane and_ Tho:Wright _Instrument-maker to\r\nHis Majesty at the Orrery and Globe near Salisbury Court_\r\n\r\nFLEET STREET LONDON\r\n\r\nESTATES Survey’d _ALSO_ MAPS _DRAWN_ and _ENGRAV’D_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The distribution of the Stars into 6 classes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of _Telescopical Stars_.]\r\n\r\nThe astronomers distribute the Stars into several orders or classes;\r\nthose that are nearest to us, and appear brightest to the eye, are\r\ncalled Stars of the first magnitude; those that are nearest to them\r\nin brightness and lustre, are called Stars of the second magnitude;\r\nthose of the third class, are stiled Stars of the third magnitude;\r\nand so on, until we come to the Stars of the sixth magnitude, which\r\nare the smallest that can be discerned by the naked eye. There are\r\ninfinite numbers of smaller Stars, that can be seen through telescopes;\r\nbut these are not reduced to any of the six orders, and are only\r\ncalled _Telescopical Stars_. It may be here observed, that tho’ the\r\nastronomers have reduced all the Stars that are visible to the naked\r\neye, into some one or other of these classes, yet we are not to\r\nconclude from thence that all the Stars answer exactly to some or other\r\nof these orders; but there may be in reality as many orders of the\r\nStars, as they are in number, few of them appearing exactly of the same\r\nbigness and lustre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Stars digested into constellations]\r\n\r\nThe ancient astronomers, that they might distinguish the Stars, in\r\nregard to their situation and position to each other, divided the\r\nwhole starry firmament into Several _Asterisms_, or systems of Stars,\r\nconsisting of those that are near to one another. These _Asterisms_\r\nare called _Constellations_, and are digested into the forms of some\r\nanimals; as Men, Lyons, Bears, Serpents, _&c._ or to the images of some\r\nknown things; as, of a Crown, a Harp, a Triangle, _&c._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Zodiac._]\r\n\r\nThe starry firmament was divided by the ancients into 48 images,\r\nor constellations; twelve of which they placed in that part of the\r\nHeavens wherein are the planes of the Planetary orbits; which part is\r\ncalled the _Zodiac_, because most of the constellations placed therein\r\nresemble some living creature. The two regions of the Heavens that are\r\non each side of the _Zodiac_, are called the North and South parts of\r\nthe Heavens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constellations within the Zodiac.]\r\n\r\nThe constellations within the _Zodiac_ are, 1. _Aries_, the _Ram_;\r\n2. _Taurus_, the _Bull_; 3. _Gemini_, the _Twins_; 4. _Cancer_, the\r\n_Crab_; 5. _Leo_, the _Lion_; 6. _Virgo_, the _Virgin_; 7. _Libra_,\r\nthe _Balance_; 8. _Scorpio_, the _Scorpion_; 9. _Sagittarius_,\r\nthe _Archer_; 10. _Capricornus_, the _Goat_; 11. _Aquarius_, the\r\n_Water-Bearer_; and, 12. _Pisces_, the _Fishes_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Northern constellations.]\r\n\r\nThe constellations on the North side of the _Zodiac_ are Twenty-one,\r\n_viz._ the _Little Bear_; the _Great Bear_; the _Dragon_; _Cepheus_, a\r\nking of _Ethiopia_; _Bootes_, the keeper of the _Bear_; the _Northern\r\nCrown_; _Hercules_ with his Club, watching the _Dragon_; the _Harp_;\r\nthe _Swan_; _Cassiopeia_; _Persius_; _Andromeda_; the _Triangle_;\r\n_Auriga_; _Pegasus_, or the _Flying Horse_; _Equuleus_; the _Dolphin_;\r\nthe _Arrow_; the _Eagle_; _Serpentarius_; and the _Serpent_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern constellations.]\r\n\r\nThe constellations noted by the ancients on the South side of the\r\n_Zodiac_, were fifteen, _viz._ the _Whale_; the river _Eridanus_;\r\nthe _Hare_; _Orion_; the _Great Dog_; _Little Dog_; the Ship _Argo_;\r\n_Hydra_; the _Centaur_; the _Cup_; the _Crow_; the _Wolf_; the\r\n_Altar_; the _Southern Crown_; and the _Southern Fish_. To these have\r\nbeen lately added the following, _viz._ The _Phœnix_; the _Crane_;\r\nthe _Peacock_; the _Indian_; the _Bird of Paradise_; the _Southern\r\nTriangle_; the _Fly_; _Cameleon_; the _Flying Fish_; _Toucan_, or\r\nthe _American Goose_; the _Water Serpent_, and the _Sword Fish_. The\r\nancients placed those particular constellations or figures in the\r\nHeavens, either to commemorate the deeds of some great man, or some\r\nnotable exploit or action; or else took them from the fables of their\r\nreligion, _&c_. And the modern astronomers do still retain them, to\r\navoid the confusion that would arise by making new ones, when they\r\ncompare the modern observations with the old ones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Unformed Stars._]\r\n\r\nSome of the principal Stars have particular names given them, as\r\n_Syrius_, _Arcturus_, _&c._ There are also several Stars that are not\r\nreduced into constellations, and these are called _Unformed Stars_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Galaxy_, or _Milky Way_.]\r\n\r\nBesides the Stars visible to the naked eye, there is a very remarkable\r\nspace in the Heavens, called the _Galaxy_, or _Milky Way_. This is a\r\nbroad circle of a whitish hue, like milk, going quite round the whole\r\nHeavens, and consisting of an infinite number of small Stars, visible\r\nthro’ a telescope, tho’ not discernable by the naked eye, by reason\r\nof their exceeding faintness; yet with their light they combine to\r\nillustrate that part of the Heavens where they are, and to cause that\r\nshining whiteness.\r\n\r\nThe places of the fixed Stars, or their relative situations one from\r\nanother, have been carefully observed by astronomers, and digested into\r\ncatalogues. The first among the _Greeks_, who reduced the Stars into\r\na catalogue, was _Hypparchus_, who, from his own observations, and of\r\nthose who lived before him, inserted 1022 Stars into his catalogue,\r\nabout 120 years before the Christian _Æra_: This catalogue has been\r\nsince enlarged and improved by several learned men, to the number of\r\n3000, of which there are a great many telescopical, and not to be\r\ndiscerned by the naked eye; and these are all ranked in the catalogue\r\nas the Stars of the seventh magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to some, that there are no more than this number\r\nof Stars visible to the naked eye; for sometimes in a clear night\r\nthey seem to be innumerable: but this is only a deception of our\r\nsight, arising from their vehement sparkling, while we look upon them\r\nconfusedly, without reducing them into any order; for there can seldom\r\nbe seen above 1000 Stars in the whole Heavens with the naked eye at the\r\nsame time; and if we should distinctly view them, we shall not find\r\nmany but what are inserted upon a good _Celestial_ Globe.\r\n\r\nAltho’ the number of Stars that can be discerned by the naked eye\r\nare so few, yet it is probable there are many more which are beyond\r\nthe reach of our optics, for through telescopes they appear in vast\r\nmultitudes, every where dispersed throughout the whole Heaven; and\r\nthe better our glasses are, the more of them we still discover. The\r\ningenious Dr. _Hook_ has observed 78 Stars in the _Pleiades_, of\r\nwhich the naked eye is never able to discern above 7; and in _Orion_,\r\nwhich has but 80 Stars in the _British_ catalogue (and some of them\r\ntelescopical) there has been numbered 2000 Stars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An idea of the Universe.]\r\n\r\nThose who think that all these glorious bodies were created for no\r\nother purpose than to give us a little dim light, must entertain a\r\nvery slender idea of the Divine Wisdom; for we receive more light from\r\nthe _Moon_ itself, than from all the _Stars_ put together. And since\r\nthe _Planets_ are subject to the same laws of motion with our _Earth_,\r\nand some of them not only equal, but vastly exceed it in magnitude,\r\nit is not unreasonable to suppose, that they are all habitable Worlds.\r\nAnd since the _Fixed Stars_ are no ways behind our _Sun_, either in\r\nbigness or lustre, is it not probable, that each of them have a system\r\nof _Planetary Worlds_ turning round them, as we do round our Sun? And\r\nif we ascend as far as the smallest Star we can see, shall we not then\r\ndiscover innumerable more of these glorious bodies, which now are\r\naltogether invisible to us? And so _ad infinitum_, thro’ the boundless\r\nspace of the universe. What a magnificient idea must this raise in us\r\nof the _Divine Being_! Who is every where, and at all times present,\r\ndisplaying his Divine Power, Wisdom and Goodness, amongst all his\r\nCreatures!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The_ DESCRIPTION _and_ USE _of the_ CELESTIAL _and_ TERRESTRIAL GLOBES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Globe_ or _Sphere_.]\r\n\r\nA _Globe_ or _Sphere_ is a round solid body, having every part of its\r\nsurface equally distant from a point within it, called its _Center_;\r\nand it may be conceived to be formed by the revolution of a semicircle\r\nround its diameter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Great Circle._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hemispheres._]\r\n\r\nAny circle passing through the center of the sphere, thereby dividing\r\ninto two equal parts or segments, is called a _Great Circle_; and the\r\nsegments of the sphere so divided, are called _Hemispheres_.\r\n\r\nEvery great circle has its Poles and Axis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Poles._]\r\n\r\nThe _Poles_ of a great circle are two points on the surface of the\r\nsphere, diametrically opposite to one another, and every where equally\r\ndistant from the said circle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Axis._]\r\n\r\nThe _Axis_ of a circle is a right line passing through the center of\r\nthe sphere, and through the Poles of the said circle, and is therefore\r\nperpendicular to the Plane: Therefore\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Secundaries._]\r\n\r\nAll circles passing through the Poles of any great circle, intersect\r\nit in two places diametrically opposite, and also at right angles;\r\nand with respect to the said great circle, they may be called its\r\n_Secundaries_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parallel_ or _lesser Circles_.]\r\n\r\nAll circles dividing the sphere into two unequal parts, are called\r\n_lesser_ or _parallel Circles_, and are usually denominated by that\r\ngreat circle to which they are parallel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Terrestrial Globe._]\r\n\r\nThe Earth being globular, its outward parts, as the several\r\n_Countries_, _Seas_, _&c._ are best, and most naturally represented\r\nupon the surfaces of a Globe; and when such a body has the outward\r\nparts of the Earth and Sea delineated upon its surface, and placed in\r\ntheir natural order and situation, it is called a _Terrestrial Globe_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Celestial Globe._]\r\n\r\nThe Celestial Bodies appear to us as if they were all placed in the\r\nsame concave sphere, therefore astronomers place the Stars according to\r\ntheir respective situations and magnitudes, and also the images of the\r\nconstellations, upon the external surface of a Globe; for it answers\r\nthe same purposes as if they were placed within a concave sphere, if we\r\nsuppose the Globe to be transparent, and the eye placed in the center.\r\nA Globe having the Stars placed upon its surface, as above described,\r\nis called a _Celestial Globe_. These Globes are both placed in frames,\r\nwith other appurtenances, as shall be described in a proper place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The principal use of the Globes.]\r\n\r\nThe principal uses of the Globes (besides their serving as _Maps_, to\r\ndistinguish the outward parts of the Earth, and the situations of the\r\nfixed Stars) is to explain and resolve the phænomena arising from the\r\ndiurnal motion of the Earth round its Axis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: There will be the same prospect of the fixed Stars whether\r\nthe spectator be placed on the Earth, or in the Sun.]\r\n\r\nIt has been shewed in the Introduction, that the distance of the Earth\r\nfrom the Sun, is no more than a point, when compared with the immense\r\ndistance of the fixed Stars; therefore let the Earth be in what point\r\nsoever of her orbit, there will be the same prospect of the Heavens,\r\nas a spectator would observe did he reside in the Sun: And if several\r\ncircles be imagined to pass thro’ the center of the Earth, and others,\r\nparallel to them, be conceived to pass thro’ the center of the Sun,\r\nthese circles in the Heavens will seem to coincide, and to pass exactly\r\nthro’ the same Stars. Wherefore as to the appearances of the fixed\r\nStars, it is indifferent whether the Earth or the Sun be made the\r\ncenter of the Universe. But because it is from the Earth that we always\r\nobserve the celestial bodies, and their apparent motions seem to us to\r\nbe really made in the Heavens, it is more natural in explaining the\r\nphænomena arising from these motions, to place the Earth in the center.\r\nAnd again, because the semidiameter of the Earth, when compared to her\r\ndistance from the Sun, is of no sensible magnitude, any point, upon the\r\nEarth’s surface, let her be in what part soever of the orbit, may be\r\nconsidered as being the center of the Universe. Upon these principles,\r\nthe different phænomena arising from the diurnal motion of the Earth,\r\nand the different situation of a spectator upon its surface, are very\r\nnaturally illustrated and explained by the Globes.\r\n\r\nAs to the alterations of seasons, _&c._ arising from the annual motion\r\nof the Earth round the Sun, it is indifferent which we suppose to move,\r\nthe Earth or the Sun, for in both cases the effect will be the same.\r\nWherefore because it is the Sun that appears to us to move, we say the\r\nSun is in such a part of the ecliptic, without attributing any motion\r\nto the Earth, any more than if she had actually been at rest. For the\r\nsame reason we say the Sun rises, or the Sun sets; by which we mean\r\nthat he begins to appear or disappear, without considering in the least\r\nhow these effects are produced. These things are here mentioned, to\r\nobviate the objections that might be made by beginners, after they have\r\nbeen told that the Sun stands still.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n    _An Explanation of the Circles of the Sphere, and of\r\n        some Astronomical Terms arising therefrom._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Circles of the Sphere_.]\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the relative situations of places upon the Earth,\r\nas well as the positions of the fixed Stars, and other Celestial\r\nphænomena, the Globe of the Earth is supposed to be environed by\r\nseveral imaginary circles, and these are called the _Circles of the\r\nSphere_. These imaginary circles are either fixed, and always obtain\r\nthe same position in the Heavens, or moveable, according to the\r\nposition of the observer.\r\n\r\nThose circles that are fixed, owe their origin to the two-fold motion\r\nof the Earth, and are the _Equator_, and the _Ecliptic_, with their\r\n_Secundaries_ and _Parallels._ These fixed circles are usually\r\ndelineated upon the surface of the Globes.\r\n\r\nThe moveable circles are only the _Horizon_, its _Secundaries_ and\r\n_Parallels_: These are represented by the wooden frame, and the brass\r\nring, wherein the Globe is hung, and a thin plate of brass to be\r\nscrewed in a proper place, upon the said ring, as occasion requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Of the Equinoctial._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Equator_, or _Equinoctial_.]\r\n\r\n1. The _Equator_, or the _Equinoctial_, is that great circle in the\r\nHeavens, in whose plane the Earth performs her diurnal motion round her\r\naxis; or it is that great circle, parallel to which the whole Heavens\r\nseem to turn round the Earth from East to West in 24 Hours.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The Equator and the Equinoctial are generally synonymous terms;\r\nbut sometimes the Equator particularly signifies that great circle upon\r\nthe surface of the Earth, which coincides with the Equinoctial in the\r\nHeavens. This circle is also by Mariners commonly called the _Line_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Northern_ and _Southern Hemispheres_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Axis of the World._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Poles of the World_, or _of the Equator_.]\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial divides the globe of the Earth, and also the whole\r\nHeavens into two equal parts, North and South, which are called the\r\n_Northern_ and _Southern Hemispheres_. The axis of this circle, is\r\ncalled the _Axis of the World_, or the _Earth’s Axis_, because the\r\nEarth revolves about it (from West to East) in 24 hours. The extreme of\r\nthis axis are called the _Poles of the World_, whereof that which lies\r\nin the Northern Hemisphere, is called the _North Pole_, and the other\r\nis called the _South Pole_. The equinoctial circle is always delineated\r\nupon the surface of each globe, with its name at length expressed; the\r\naxis of this circle, or the Earth’s axis, is only an imaginary line in\r\nthe Heavens, but on the globes it is expressed by the wires about which\r\nthey really turn. The Poles of the world, are the two points upon the\r\nsurface of the globe through which these wires pass; the North Pole is\r\nthat which hath the little brass circle, with a moveable index placed\r\nround it; and the other opposite to it is the South Pole. The Northern\r\nHemisphere is that wherein the North Pole is placed, and the opposite\r\none is the Southern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers divide all circles into 360 equal parts, called\r\n_Degrees_, each degree into 60 equal parts, called _Minutes_, each\r\nminute into 60 _Seconds_, &c. But besides this division into degrees,\r\nthe equinoctial is also divided into 24 equal parts, or _Hours_, each\r\nhour into 60 _Minutes_, each minute into 60 _Seconds, &c._ so that one\r\nhour is equal to 15 degrees, each minute of time is equal to 15 minutes\r\nof a degree, _&c._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hour Circles_ or _Circles of Ascension_, also called\r\n_Meridians_.]\r\n\r\n2. All circles conceived to pass through the Poles of the world,\r\nintersecting the equinoctial at right angles, are, with respect to\r\nany point in the Heavens, called _Hour Circles_; and the _Circles\r\nof Ascension_, because the ascension of the Heavenly bodies, from a\r\ncertain point, are by them determined.\r\n\r\nThese circles are also, with regard to places upon Earth, called\r\n_Meridians_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Brass Meridian_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Meridians_ are commonly drawn upon the Terrestrial Globe thro’\r\nevery 15 degrees of the equinoctial, thereby making an Hour difference\r\nbetwixt the places through which they pass. On the Celestial Globe\r\nthere are commonly drawn but two of these _Meridians_, crossing the\r\nequinoctial in four points equidistant from one another, thereby\r\ndividing it into four quadrants; but the intermediate ones are here\r\nsupplied, and also upon the Terrestrial Globe, by the brass circle on\r\nwhich they are hung, which, is therefore called the _Brass Meridian_,\r\nand sometimes only the _Meridian_, it serving for this purpose to all\r\nthe points upon either Globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Hour Circle_.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a little brass circle fixed upon this meridian, divided\r\ninto 24 Hours, having an index moveable round the axis of the globe, to\r\nbe turned to any particular Hour. The use of this circle is to shew the\r\ndifference of time betwixt any two meridians, and is therefore called\r\nthe _Hour Circle_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parallels of Declination._]\r\n\r\n3. All circles parallel to the equinoctial are, with respect to any\r\npoint in the Heavens, called _Parallels of Declination_. So that,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Declination North_ and _South_.]\r\n\r\n4. The _Declination of any Point_ in the Heavens (as of the _Sun_, a\r\n_fixed Star_, or the like) is an arch of the meridian passing through\r\nthat point, and intercepted betwixt it and the equator; and if the\r\nsaid point be to the (Northward/Southward) of the equator, it is\r\ncalled (_North_/_South_) _Declination_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tropics_ and _Polar Circles_.]\r\n\r\nOf the parallels of declination, four are eminently distinguished by\r\nparticular names, _viz._ The two _Tropics_, and the two _Polar Circles_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tropic of Cancer; of Capricorn._]\r\n\r\nThe tropics are on different sides of the equator each 23 degrees and\r\n29 minutes distant from it; that which lies in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nis called the _Tropic of Cancer_, and the Southern one, the _Tropic of\r\nCapricorn_.\r\n\r\nThese circles are the limits of the Sun’s greatest declination, and are\r\ncalled tropics, because whenever the Sun arrives to them, he seems to\r\nreturn back again towards the equator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Arctic Circle._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Arctic Pole._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antarctic Circle._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antarctic Pole._]\r\n\r\n6. The _Polar Circles_ are each of them at the same distance from the\r\nPoles of the world, that the tropics are from the equator, _viz._\r\n23° 29′. That which lies near the North Pole, is called the _Arctic\r\nCircle_, from _Arctos_, a constellation situated in the Heavens near\r\nthat Place; whence also this Pole is sometimes called the _Arctic\r\nPole_. The other Polar circle, which is situated near the South Pole;\r\nis called the _Antarctic Circle_, because its position is contrary to\r\nthe other; and the South Pole is sometimes called the _Antarctic Pole_.\r\n\r\nThe tropics and the Polar circles have each their names expressed upon\r\nthe Globes.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Of the Ecliptic._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ecliptic._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Equinoctial._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Solstitial Points._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Colures._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Equinoctial Colure._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Solstitial Colure._]\r\n\r\n7. The _Ecliptic_ is that great circle in whose plane the Earth\r\nperforms its annual motion round the Sun; or, in which the Sun seems\r\nto move round the Earth, once in a year. This circle makes an angle\r\nwith the equinoctial of 23 degrees 29 minutes, and intersects it in\r\ntwo opposite points, which are called the _Equinoctial Points_; and\r\nthe two points in the ecliptic that are at the greatest distance from\r\nthe equinoctial points, are called the _Solstitial Points_. The two\r\nmeridians passing through those points, are, by way of eminence, called\r\n_Colures_; whereof that which passeth thro’ the equinoctial points, is\r\ncalled the _Equinoctial Colure_; and that which is at right angles to\r\nit, passing through the Solstitial Points, is called the _Solstitial\r\nColure_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ecliptic divided into signs.]\r\n\r\nThe ecliptic is divided into 12 equal parts, called _Signs_, each sign\r\nbeing 30 degrees, beginning from one of the equinoctial points, and\r\nnumbered from West to East; the names and characters of the twelve\r\nsigns are as follows, _viz._\r\n\r\n    _Aries_, _Taurus_, _Gemini_, _Cancer_, _Leo_, _Virgo_,\r\n     1. ♈     2. ♉     3. ♊     4. ♋    5. ♌   6. ♍\r\n    _Libra_, _Scorpio_, _Sagittarius_, _Capricornus_, _Aquaries_,\r\n     7. ♎     8. ♏        9. ♐          10. ♑        11. ♒\r\n    _Pisces_.\r\n     12. ♓\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Northern Signs._]\r\n\r\nThe first six of these are called the _Northern Signs_, and possess\r\nthat half of the ecliptic which is to the Northward of the equator;\r\nbeginning with the first point of ♈, and ending with the last point of\r\n♍.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Southern Signs._]\r\n\r\nThe latter six are called the _Southern Signs_, because they possess\r\nthe Southern half of the ecliptic; beginning at the first point of ♎,\r\nand ending with the last point of ♓.\r\n\r\nThe division of the ecliptic into signs, and the names of the colures,\r\nare particularly expressed upon the globes.\r\n\r\nThe signs of the ecliptic took their names from 12 constellations\r\nmentioned in the Introduction to be situated in the Heavens near those\r\nplaces. It is to be observed, that the signs are not to be confounded\r\nwith the constellations of the same name: For the _Sign of Aries_, is\r\nnot the same with the _Constellation_ Aries; the latter is a system of\r\nStars digested into the figure of a _Ram_, but the sign of _Aries_ is\r\nonly 30 degrees of the ecliptic, counted from the equinoctial point ♈,\r\n(which is reckoned the first point in the ecliptic) to the beginning\r\nof _Taurus_: Or, it is sometimes taken for all that space upon the\r\nCelestial Globe contained between the two circles passing through the\r\nfirst points of ♈ and ♉. What has been here said of _Aries_, is to be\r\nnoted of all the rest of the signs.\r\n\r\nThe constellations above-mentioned were formerly situated within\r\nthe signs which now bear their names; but by a slow motion of the\r\nequinoctial points, being one degree in 72 years, the constellation\r\n_Aries_ has now got into the sign ♉, and so of the rest. So that\r\n_Pisces_ is now got into the Sign of ♈; this slow motion in the Heavens\r\nis called the _Precession of the Equinoctial Points_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Poles of the Ecliptic._]\r\n\r\nThe _Poles of the Ecliptic_ are both situated in the Solstitial Colure,\r\nat 23 degrees, 29 minutes distance from the Pole of the world; and they\r\ntake their denomination from the Hemisphere wherein they are placed,\r\n_viz._ that which lies in the (Northern/Southern) Hemisphere, is called\r\nthe (North/South) Pole of the ecliptic. The arctic and antarctic\r\ncircles, are described by the Poles of the ecliptic in the diurnal\r\nmotion of the Earth round its axis, whence it seems these two circles\r\nare called _Polar_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Circles of Longitude._]\r\n\r\n8. All great circles passing through the Poles of the ecliptic, and\r\nconsequently intersecting it at right angles, are called _Circles of\r\nLongitude_: So that,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Longitude of any Point in the Heavens._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Place of a Star._]\r\n\r\n9. The _Longitude_ of any _Point_ in the Heavens (as a _Star_ or\r\n_Planet_, _&c._) is an arch of the ecliptic contained between the\r\ncircle of longitude passing thro’ that point, and the equinoctial\r\npoint ♈. And that degree of any sign which lies under the circle of\r\nlongitude, passing thro’ any Star or Planet, is called the _Place_ of\r\nthat Star or Planet.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The _Sun_ never goes out of the ecliptic, and it is not usual\r\nto say the Sun’s longitude, but we commonly express it the _Sun’s\r\nPlace_, which is that sign, degree, minute, _&c._, of the ecliptic,\r\nwhich he at any time passes.\r\n\r\n10. All circles conceived to be drawn parallel to the ecliptic, are\r\ncalled _Parallels of Latitude_: So that,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Latitude of a Star, &c._]\r\n\r\n11. The _Latitude_ of any point in the Heavens, (as a fixed Star,\r\n_&c._) is an arch of the circle of longitude, in passing thro’ that\r\npoint, and intercepted betwixt it, and the ecliptic; or, the latitude\r\nis the distance from the ecliptic; and if the said point be to the\r\nNorthward of the ecliptic, it is called North Latitude; but if it be to\r\nthe Southward, is called South Latitude.\r\n\r\nUpon the _Terrestrial Globe_, none of the circles of longitude are\r\ndescribed; and upon the _Celestial_, they are commonly drawn thro’\r\nthe beginning of every _Sign_; but they are all supplied upon both\r\nGlobes, by fastening a thin plate of brass over one of the Poles of the\r\necliptic, and so as to be moved to any degree thereof at pleasure. The\r\nparallels of latitude are also supplied by the graduations upon the\r\nsaid plate, as shall be shewn in a proper place.\r\n\r\nWe have now done with all those circles that are fixed, and such as\r\nare drawn upon the Globes themselves; we next proceed to the moveable\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Of the Horizon._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Horizon._]\r\n\r\n12. The _Horizon_ is that great circle which divides the upper, or\r\nvisible Hemisphere of the world, from the lower, or invisible: This\r\ncircle is distinguished into two sorts, the _Sensible_, and the\r\n_Rational_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sensible Horizon._]\r\n\r\nThe _Sensible_, or _Apparent Horizon_, is that circle which limits or\r\ndeterminates our prospect, whether we are at land or sea, reaching as\r\nfar as we can see, or it is that circle where the Sky and the Earth, or\r\nWater, seem to meet. When we are on _Terra Firma_, this circle commonly\r\nseems rugged and irregular, occasioned by the unevenness of the ground\r\nterminating our prospect; but at sea there are no such irregularities;\r\nthe semidiameter of this circle varieth according to the height of\r\nthe eye of the observer; if a man of six feet high stood upon a large\r\nplain, or the surface of the sea, he could not see above three miles\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThis circle determines the rising and setting of the Heavenly bodies,\r\nand distinguishes Day and Night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rational Horizon._]\r\n\r\nThe _Rational_, or true _Horizon_, is a great circle passing thro’ the\r\ncenter of the Earth, parallel to the sensible Horizon, being distant\r\nfrom it by the Earth’s semidiameter, which is about 3980 miles: This\r\ndistance is nothing in comparison of the immense distance of the Sun\r\nand the fixed Stars, therefore astronomers make no distinction between\r\nthese two circles, but consider the apparent Horizon, or that wherein\r\nthe Sun appears to rise and set, as passing thro’ the center of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cardinal Points of the Horizon._]\r\n\r\nThis circle is divided by astronomers into four quadrants, and each of\r\nthe quadrants into 90 degrees, _&c._ The four points quartering this\r\ncircle are called the _Cardinal Points_, and are termed the _East_,\r\n_West_, _North_, and _South_. The _East_ is that point of the Horizon\r\nwhere the Sun rises when he is in the equinoctial, or on that day when\r\nhe ascends above the Horizon exactly at six o’clock; and the _West_\r\nis that point of the Horizon which is directly opposite to the East,\r\nor where the Sun Sets when he is in the Equinoctial. The _South_ is\r\n90 degrees distant from the East and West, and is toward that part of\r\nthe Heavens wherein the Sun always appears to us in _Great-Britain_ at\r\nNoon; and the _North_ is that part of the Heavens which is directly\r\nopposite to the South: Or, the North and South points of the Heavens\r\nmay be found by turning yourself either directly towards the East or\r\nthe West: If you look towards the (East/West) the (South/North) will be\r\nto the right Hand, and the (North/South) to the left.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Points of the Compass._]\r\n\r\nBesides the aforementioned divisions of the Horizon into degrees.\r\n_Mariners_ divide it into 32 equal parts, which they call the _Points\r\nof the Compass_; to each of which points they give a particular name,\r\ncompounded of the four Cardinals, according to what quarter of the\r\nCompass is intended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Zenith._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nadir._]\r\n\r\nThe center of the Horizon is the place of observation, and the Poles of\r\nit are one exactly over our heads, called the _Zenith_; and the other\r\nexactly under our feet, called the _Nadir_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Vertical Circles._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Meridian._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Azimuth._]\r\n\r\n13. All circles conceived to pass thro’ the Zenith and Nadir, are\r\ncalled _Vertical Circles_, or _Azimuths_. Of these circles, that which\r\npasseth thro’ the North and South points of the Horizon, is called the\r\n_Meridian_; so that when any object is upon the Meridian, it then bears\r\neither due South, or due North from us; and the _Azimuth_ of any object\r\nis an arch of the Horizon intercepted between the vertical circle\r\npassing through it, and either the North or South part of the Meridian;\r\nwhich part is commonly specified.\r\n\r\nThe meridian passes thro’ the Poles of the world, as well as through\r\nthe Zenith and Nadir, and therefore is a secundary both of the\r\nequinoctial and the horizon: This circle divides the globe into the\r\n_Eastern_ and _Western Hemispheres_, and the Poles of it are the _East_\r\nand _West_ points of the _Horizon_. All the heavenly objects are,\r\nduring one half of their continuance above the horizon, in the Eastern\r\nHemisphere, and for the other half in the Western; so that whenever the\r\nSun arrives upon the upper part of the meridian, it is then _Noon_, or\r\n_Mid-day_, which is the reason why this circle is called the meridian;\r\nand when he comes to the lower part, it is then _Midnight_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Prime Vertical._]\r\n\r\nThe vertical circle passing thro’ the East and West points of the\r\nhorizon, is called the _Prime Vertical_, or _Circle_ of _East_ and\r\n_West_, so that when any object is upon this circle in the Eastern\r\nhemisphere, it appears due East; and if it be in the Western\r\nhemisphere, it appears due West.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Amplitude._]\r\n\r\nThat degree in the horizon wherein any object rises or sets from the\r\nEast or West points, is called the _Amplitude_; which for rising is\r\ncalled _Amplitude Ortive_, and _Occasive_ for setting; which must be\r\nalso denominated whether it be Northerly or Southerly.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, that the _Amplitude_ and _Azimuth_ are much the\r\nsame; the amplitude shewing the bearing of any object when he rises or\r\nsets, from the East or West points of the horizon; and the azimuth,\r\nthe bearing of any object when it is above the horizon, either from\r\nthe North or South point thereof. As for example, if an object rises or\r\nsets within 10 degrees of the East or West, suppose towards the South,\r\nwe accordingly say, its _Amplitude_ is 10 degrees Southerly; but if\r\nan object, that is of any height above the horizon, should be in the\r\nvertical circle, passing thro’ the before-mentioned point, we then say,\r\nits _Azimuth_ is 80 degrees from the South, or 100 degrees from the\r\nNorth, both which expressions signify the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Almacanthers._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Altitudes._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Meridian Altitude._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Zenith Distance._]\r\n\r\n14. All circles drawn parallel to the horizon, in the upper hemisphere,\r\nare called _Almacanthers_, or _Parallels of Altitude_: So that the\r\n_Altitude_ of any point in the Heavens is an arch of the vertical\r\ncircle passing thro’ that point, and intercepted betwixt it and the\r\nhorizon; and if the object be upon the meridian, it is commonly called\r\nthe _Meridian Altitude_. The complement of the altitude, or what it\r\nwants of 90 degrees, is called the _Zenith Distance_.\r\n\r\nThe horizon (by which we mean the rational) is represented by the\r\nupper surface of the Wooden frame, wherein the globes are placed; upon\r\nthis horizon are described several concentric circles, the innermost\r\nof which is divided into degrees, which ought to be numbered both ways\r\nfrom the East and the West, until they end at 90 degrees in the North\r\nand South points. The use of these divisions is to shew the amplitudes\r\nof the Sun and Stars, at their rising and setting: Also in some\r\nconvenient place upon this horizon, there is commonly noted the points\r\nof the Compass. Without the before-mentioned circle there is drawn the\r\necliptic with its divisions, into signs, and degrees, and a circle of\r\nmonths and days: The use of these two circles is to serve as a kalendar\r\nto shew the Sun’s place at any time of the year, and by that means to\r\nfind his place in the _Ecliptic_, drawn upon the globe itself.\r\n\r\nThe _Vertical Circles_, and the _Parallels of Altitude_, are supplied\r\nby a thin plate of brass, having a nut and screw at one end to fasten\r\nit to the brass meridian in the Zenith point; which being done, the\r\nlower end of it may be put between the globe it self, and the inner\r\nedge of the horizon, and so turned round about to any point required.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Quadrant of Altitude._]\r\n\r\nThe fiducial edge thereof representing the _Vertical Circles_, and the\r\n_Degrees_ upon it, describing the Parallels of Altitude. This thin\r\nplate is called the _Quadrant of Altitude_.\r\n\r\nThe center of the horizon being the place of observation, it is\r\nevident that this circle, and all the others belonging to it, are\r\ncontinually changed, which way soever we move; wherefore we may\r\nsuppose the horizon, with its secundaries and parallels, to invest\r\nthe globe like a _rete_ or net; and to be moveable every way round\r\nit. This is very naturally illustrated by the globes; if we move\r\ndirectly North, or directly South, the change made in the horizon,\r\nis represented by moving the brass meridian (keeping the globe from\r\nturning about its axis) in the notches made in the wooden horizon,\r\njust so much as we travelled. If our course should be due East, or\r\ndue West, the alterations made thereby are represented by turning the\r\nglobe accordingly about its axis, the brass meridian being kept fixed;\r\nand if we steer betwixt the meridian and the East or West points,\r\nthen we are to turn the brass meridian, and also the globe about its\r\naxis accordingly; the sum of which is, let the spectator be at what\r\npoint soever of the Earth’s surface, he’ll there gravitate, or tend\r\nexactly towards its center, and imagine himself to be on the highest\r\npart thereof, (the unevenness of the ground not being here considered)\r\nwherefore if we turn the globe in such a manner as to bring the several\r\nprogressive steps of a traveller successively to the Zenith, we shall\r\nthen have the successive alterations made in the horizon, in every part\r\nof his journey. This explication being well considered, will be of help\r\nto young beginners, to conceive how the Earth is every where habitable;\r\nand how passengers can travel quite round it; for since every thing\r\ntends toward the center of the Earth, we are to conceive that point as\r\nbeing the lowest, and not to carry our idea of downwards any farther.\r\nThose that are diametrically opposite to us being as much upon the\r\nupper part of the Earth as we are, there being no such thing in nature\r\nas one place being higher than another, but as it is at a greater\r\ndistance from the center of the Earth, let it be in what country soever.\r\n\r\nWe have now done with all the circles of the sphere, and it may be\r\nobserved, that the _Equinoctial_, the _Ecliptic_, and the _Horizon_,\r\nwith their Secundaries and parallels, are all alike; and altering their\r\nposition, may be made to serve for one another. Thus, if the _Poles of\r\nthe World_ be brought into the _Zenith_ and _Nadir_, the _Equinoctial_\r\nwill coincide with the _Horizon_, the _Meridians_ will be the same\r\nwith the _Vertical Circles_, and the parallels of _Declination_ will\r\nbe the parallels of _Altitude_. After the same manner, if shifting\r\nthe position, we bring the _Ecliptic_ to coincide with the _Horizon_,\r\nthe circles of _Longitude_ will be the _Vertical Circles_, and the\r\nparallels of _Latitude_ and _Altitude_ will coincide.\r\n\r\nThe horizon and the equator may be either parallel, perpendicular, or\r\noblique to each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Parallel Sphere._]\r\n\r\n15. A _Parallel Sphere_ is that position where the equator coincides\r\nwith the horizon, and consequently the poles of the world are in the\r\nZenith and Nadir: The inhabitants of this sphere (if there be any) are\r\nthose who live under the poles of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Right Sphere._]\r\n\r\n16. A _Right_ or _Direct Sphere_ is that position where the equator is\r\nperpendicular to the horizon, the inhabitants whereof are those who\r\nlive under the equinoctial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Oblique Sphere._]\r\n\r\n17. An _Oblique Sphere_ is when the equinoctial and the horizon make\r\noblique angles with each other, which every where happens but under the\r\nequator and the poles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Diurnal_ and _Nocturnal Arch_.]\r\n\r\nThe arch of any parallel or declination, which stands above the horizon\r\nis called the _Diurnal Arch_; and the remaining part of it, which is\r\nbelow the horizon, is called the _Nocturnal Arch_.\r\n\r\nThat point of the equinoctial which comes to the (Eastern/Western)\r\npart of the horizon with any point of the Heavens, is called the\r\n(Ascension/Descension) of that point, counted from the beginning of ♈;\r\nand if it be in a right sphere, the ascension or descension is called\r\nright; but if it be an oblique sphere it is called an oblique ascension\r\nor descension. So that,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Right Ascension._]\r\n\r\n18. The _Right Ascension_ of the _Sun_, _Moon_, or any _Star, &c._ is\r\nan arch of the equator contained betwixt the beginning of ♈, and that\r\npoint of the equinoctial which rises with them in a _Right Sphere_, or\r\nwhich comes to the meridian with them in an oblique sphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Oblique Ascension._]\r\n\r\n19. _Oblique Ascension_, or _Descension_, is an arch of the equinoctial\r\nintercepted between the beginning of ♈, and that _Point_ of the\r\n_Equator_ which rises or sets with any point in the Heavens in an\r\noblique sphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ascensional Difference._]\r\n\r\n20. _Ascensional Difference_, is the difference betwixt the right and\r\noblique ascension or descension, and shews how long the Sun rises or\r\nsets before or after the hour of six.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Of the Division of Time._\r\n\r\nThe parts that time is distinguished into, are _Days_, _Hours_,\r\n_Weeks_, _Months_, and _Years_.\r\n\r\nA Day is either natural or artificial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Natural_ and _Artificial Day_.]\r\n\r\nA _Natural Day_ is the space of time elapsed while the Sun goes from\r\nany meridian or horary circle, ’till he arrives to the same again; or,\r\nit is the time contained from noon, or any particular hour, to the next\r\nnoon, or the same hour again: An _Artificial Day_ is the time betwixt\r\nthe Sun’s rising and setting; to which is opposed the _Night_, that is,\r\nthe time the Sun is hid under the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hours_, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Equinoxes._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Vernal_ and _Autumnal Equinox_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Solstices._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Summer_ and _Winter Solstices_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Natural Day_ is divided into 24 _Hours_, each hour into 60\r\n_Minutes_, each minute into 60 _Seconds, &c._ The _Artificial Days_ are\r\nalways unequal to all the inhabitants that are not under the equator,\r\nexcept when the Sun is in the equinoctial points ♈ and ♋, which happens\r\n(according to our way of reckoning) about the 21st of _March_, and\r\nthe 23d of _September_; at those times the Sun rises at six and sets\r\nat six to all the inhabitants of the Earth. These days are called the\r\n_Equinoxes_, or _Equinoctial Days_; the first of which, or when the Sun\r\nis in the first point of _Aries_, is called the _Vernal Equinox_, and\r\nthe latter is called the _Autumnal Equinox_. In all places where the\r\nSun descends below the horizon, excepting under the equator, the days\r\ncontinually lengthen or shorten, and that faster or slower, according\r\nas the Sun is nearer to, or further from the equinoctial, until he\r\narrives to either of the _Solstitial Points_ ♋ or ♑. At those times\r\nthe Sun seems to stand still for a few days, and then begins to return\r\nwith a slow motion towards the equinoctial, still hastening his pace\r\nas he comes nearer to it: The Sun enters the tropics of ♋ and ♑, about\r\nthe 21st of _June_, and the 22d of _December_, which days are sometimes\r\ncalled the _Solstices_; the first of which we call the _Summer\r\nSolstice_, and the latter the _Winter Solstice_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The different beginning of the day.]\r\n\r\nAll nations do not begin their day, and reckon their hours alike. In\r\n_Great-Britain_. _France_, and _Spain_, and in most places in _Europe_,\r\nthe days is reckoned to begin at midnight, from whence is counted\r\ntwelve hours ’till noon, then twelve hours more ’till next midnight,\r\nwhich makes a compleat day; yet the _Astronomers_ (in these countries)\r\ncommonly begin their day at noon, and so reckon 24 hours ’till next\r\nnoon, and not twice twelve, according to the vulgar computation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Babylonish Hours._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Italian Hours._]\r\n\r\nThe _Babylonians_ began their day at Sun-rising, and reckoned 24 hours\r\n’till he rose again! This way of computation we call the _Babylonish\r\nHours_. In several parts of _Germany_ they count their hours from\r\nSun-setting, calling the first hour after the Sun has set, the first\r\nhour, _&c._ ’till he sets the next day, which they call the 24th hour:\r\nThese are commonly called the _Italian Hours_. According to both these\r\nways of computation, their hours are commonly either a little greater\r\nor less than the ¹/₂₄ part of a natural day, in proportion as the Sun\r\nrises or sets sooner or later in the succeeding days. They have also\r\nthis inconvenience, that their mid-day and midnight happen on different\r\nhours, according to the seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jewish Hours._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Planetary Hours._]\r\n\r\nThe _Jews_ and the _Romans_ formerly divided the artificial days and\r\nnights each into 12 equal parts; these are termed the _Jewish Hours_,\r\nand are of different lengths, according to the seasons of the year;\r\na _Jewish Hour_ in summer being longer than one in winter, and a\r\nnight-hour shorter. This method of computation is now in use among the\r\n_Turks_, and the hours are stiled the _first hour_, _second hour, &c._\r\nof the day or night; so that _Mid-day_ always falls on the sixth hour\r\nof the day. These hours are also called _Planetary Hours_, because in\r\nevery hour one of the seven Planets were suppose to preside over the\r\nWorld, and so take it by turns. The first hour after Sun-rising on\r\n_Sunday_ was allotted to the _Sun_; the next to _Venus_, the third to\r\n_Mercury_; and the rest in order to the _Moon_, _Saturn_, _Jupiter_,\r\nand _Mars_. By this means on the first hour of the next day, the Moon\r\npresided, and so gave the name to that day; and so seven days by this\r\nmethod had names given them from the Planets that were supposed to\r\ngovern on the first hour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Week._]\r\n\r\nA _Week_ is a system of seven days, in which each day is distinguished\r\nby a different name. In most countries these days are called after the\r\nnames of the seven Planets, as above noted. All nations that have any\r\nnotion of religion, lay apart one day in seven for public worship; the\r\nday solemnized by _Christians_ is _Sunday_, or the first day of the\r\nweek, being that on which our saviour rose from the grave, on which\r\nthe apostles afterwards used more particularly to assemble together\r\nto perform divine worship. The _Jews_ observed _Saturday_, or the\r\nseventh day of the week, for their sabbath, or day of rest, being that\r\nappointed in the fourth commandment under the Law. The _Turks_ perform\r\ntheir religious ceremonies on _Friday_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Month._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Periodical_ and _Synodical Month_.]\r\n\r\nA _Month_ is properly a certain space of time measured by the Moon in\r\nhis course round the Earth. A _Lunar Month_ is either _Periodical_\r\nor _Synodical_. A _Periodical Month_ is that space of time the Moon\r\ntakes to perform her course from one point in the ecliptic ’till she\r\narrives to the same again, which is 27 days, and some odd hours; and\r\na _Synodical Month_ is the time betwixt one new Moon, and the next\r\nnew Moon, which is commonly about 29½ days. But a _Civil Month_, is\r\ndifferent from these, and consists of a certain number of days, fewer\r\nor more, according to the laws and customs of the country where they\r\nare observed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A _Year Sydereal_ and _Tropical_.]\r\n\r\nThe compleatest period of time is a _Year_, in which all the variety\r\nof seasons return, and afterwards begin anew. A _Year_ is either\r\n_Astronomical_ or _Civil_. An _Astronomical Year_ is either a _Sydereal_\r\nwherein the Sun departing from a fixed Star, returns to it again; or\r\n_Tropical_, which is the space of time the Sun takes to perform his\r\ncourse from any point of the ecliptic, ’till he returns to it again.\r\n\r\nA _Tropical Year_ consists of 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes; this\r\nis the time in which all the seasons compleatly returns, which is a\r\nsmall matter less than a Sydereal Year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Egyptian Year._]\r\n\r\nThe _Civil Year_ is the same with the _Political_ established with the\r\nlaws of a country; and is either moveable or immoveable. The moveable\r\nyear consists of 365 days, being less than the tropical year by almost\r\nsix hours, and is called the _Egyptian Year_, because observed in that\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nThe _Romans_ divided the year into 12 kalendar months, to which they\r\ngave particular names, and are still retained by most of the _European_\r\nnations, _viz. January_, _February_, _March_, _April_, _May_, _June_,\r\n_July_, _August_, _September_, _October_, _November_, and _December_.\r\nThe number of days in each month may be known by the following verses:\r\n\r\n    _Thirty Days hath_ September,\r\n     April, June, _and_ November;\r\n     February _hath Twenty-eight alone_,\r\n    _And all the rest have Thirty-one_.\r\n\r\nThe year is also divided into four quarters or seasons, _viz._\r\n_Spring_, _Summer_, _Autumn_, and _Winter_. These quarters are properly\r\nmade when the Sun enters into the equinoctial and solstitial points\r\nof the ecliptic; but in civil uses they are differently reckoned,\r\naccording to the customs of several countries. In _England_, we\r\ncommonly reckon the first day of _January_ to be the first in the\r\nyear, which is therefore vulgarly called _New-Year’s-Day_; but in\r\npolitical and ecclesiastical affairs, the year is reckoned to commence\r\non _Lady-day_ which is the 25th of _March_; and from thence to\r\n_Midsummer-day_, which is the 24th of _June_, is reckoned the first\r\nquarter; from _Midsummer-day_ to _Michaelmas-day_, which is the 29th of\r\n_September_, is the second quarter; the third quarter is reckoned from\r\n_Michaelmas-day_ to _Christmas-day_, which is the 25th of _December_;\r\nand from _Christmas-day_ to _Lady-day_, is reckoned the last quarter\r\nin the year. In common affairs, a quarter is reckoned from a certain\r\nday to the same in the fourth month following. Sometimes a month is\r\nreckoned four weeks, or 28 days, and so a quarter 12 weeks. To all the\r\ninhabitants in the (Northern/Southern) Hemisphere, their _Midsummer_ is\r\nproperly when the Sun is in the tropic of (_Cancer_,/_Capricorn_,) and\r\ntheir _Midwinter_ at the opposite time of the year; but those who live\r\nunder the equinoctial have two winters, _&c._ when the Sun is in either\r\ntropic; tho’ indeed properly, there is no season that may be called\r\nwinter in those parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bissextile_, or _Leap-Year_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Egyptian_ year of 365 days being less than the true solar year,\r\nby almost six hours, it follows, that four such years are less than\r\nfour solar years by a whole day; and therefore in 365 times four years,\r\nthat is, in 1460 years, the beginning of the years move through all\r\nthe seasons. To remedy this inconveniency, _Julius Cæsar_ (considering\r\nthat the six hours, which remain at the end of every year, will in four\r\nyears make a natural day) ordered that every fourth year should have an\r\nintercalary day, which therefore consists of 366 days; the day added\r\nwas put in the month of _February_, by postponing St. _Matthias_’s\r\nday, which in common years fall on the 24th, to the 25th of the said\r\nmonth, all the fixed feasts in the year from thenceforwards falling\r\na week-day later than otherwise they would. According to the _Roman_\r\nway of reckoning, the 24th of _February_ was the sixth of the kalends\r\nof _March_, and it was ordered that for this year there should be two\r\nsixths, or that the sixth of the kalends of _March_ should be twice\r\nrepeated; upon which account the year was called _Bissextile_, which we\r\nnow call the _Leap-Year_.\r\n\r\nTo find whether the year of our Lord be leap-year, or the first,\r\nsecond, or third after; divide it by four, and the remainder, if there\r\nbe any, shews how many years it is after leap-year; but if there be no\r\nremainder, then that year is leap-year: Or, you may omit the hundreds\r\nand scores, and divide the residue by 4, _Examp._ 1757, omitting the\r\nhundreds and the twenties, I divide the residue 17, by 4, and the\r\nremainder 1, shews it to be the first after leap-year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Julian Account_ or _the Old Style_.]\r\n\r\nThis method of reckoning the year, _viz._ making the common year to\r\nconsist of 365 days, and every fourth year to have 366 days, is now\r\nused in _Great-Britain_ and _Ireland_, and some of the Northern parts\r\nof _Europe_, and is called the _Julian Account_, or the _Old Style_.\r\nBut the time appointed by _Julius Cæsar_ for the length of a solar year\r\nis too much; for the Sun finishes his course in the ecliptic, in 365\r\ndays, 5 hours, and 49 minutes, which is 11 minutes less than the civil\r\nyear; and therefore he again begins his circuit 11 minutes before the\r\ncivil year is ended; and so much being gained every year, amounts in\r\n131 years, to a whole day. So that if the Sun in any year entered the\r\nequinox upon the 20th of _March_ at noon, after the space of 131 years,\r\nhe’ll enter the same point on the same hour, on the 19th of _March_.\r\nAnd therefore the exquinoxes will not always fall on the same day of\r\nthe month, but by degrees will move towards the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gregorian Account_, or _New Style_.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the _Council of Nice_, when the terms were settled for\r\nobserving of _Easter_, the _Vernal Equinox_ fell upon the 21st of\r\n_March_; but by its falling backwards 11 minutes every year, it was\r\nfound that in _Anno_ 1582, when the kalendar was corrected, the Sun\r\nentered the equinoctial circle on the 11th of _March_, having departed\r\nten whole days from its former place in the year: and therefore Pope\r\n_Gregory_ the XIIIth, designing to place the equinoxes in their\r\nsituation with respect to the year, took these ten days out of the\r\nkalendar, and ordered that the 11th of _March_ should be reckoned as\r\nthe twenty-first: And to prevent the seasons of the year from going\r\nbackwards for the future, he ordered every hundredth year, which in\r\n_Julian_ form was to be a _Bissextile_, should be a common year, and\r\nconsist only of 365 days; but that being too much, every fourth hundred\r\nwas to remain _Bissextile_. This form of reckoning being established\r\nby the authority of Pope _Gregory_ XIII. is called the _Gregorian\r\nAccount_, or the _New Style_; and is observed in all the countries\r\nwhere the authority of the Pope is acknowledged, and likewise by\r\nseveral nations of the reformed religion. There being now above an\r\nhundred years past, since the reformation was made in the kalendar, the\r\n_Gregorian_ account has accordingly got before the _Julian_ one day\r\nmore than it was in the time of its institution, the difference between\r\nthese two accounts being now eleven days; so that the first day of any\r\nmonth, according to that way of reckoning, is the 12th of the same\r\nmonth, according to the New Style.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this section with a brief account of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Atmosphere._]\r\n\r\nThe _Atmosphere_ is that thin body of air which surrounds the Earth,\r\nin which the clouds hover, and by which in their descent they are\r\nbroke into drops of rain; which sometimes, according to the warmth or\r\ncoldness of air, are froze into _Snow_, or _Hailstones_. _Thunder_ and\r\n_Lightning_ are also made in the _Atmosphere_, and wind is nothing\r\nelse but a percussion of the air, occasioned by its different density\r\nin different places. The benefits we receive from the atmosphere are\r\ninnumerable; without air no earthly creature could live, as is plainly\r\nproved by experiments made by the _Air-Pump_; and the wholsomeness\r\nof a climate chiefly depends upon that of its air: If there was no\r\natmosphere to reflect the rays of the Sun, no part of the heavens would\r\nbe lucid and bright, but that wherein the Sun was placed; and if a\r\nspectator should turn his back towards the Sun, he would immediately\r\nperceive it to be quite dark, and the least Stars would be seen shining\r\nas they do in the clearest night; and the Sun immediately before his\r\nsetting would shine as brisk as at noon, but in a moment, as soon as\r\nhe got below the horizon, the whole hemisphere of the Earth would be\r\ninvolved in as great a darkness as if it were midnight.\r\n\r\nBut by means of the atmosphere it happens, that while the Sun is above\r\nthe horizon, the whole face of the heavens is strongly illuminated by\r\nits rays, so as to obscure the faint light of the Stars, and render\r\nthem invisible; and after Sun-setting, though we receive no direct\r\nlight from him, yet we enjoy its reflected light for some time: For\r\nthe atmosphere being higher than we are, is a longer time before it\r\nis withdrawn from the Sun (as if a man was to run to the top of a\r\nsteeple, he might see the Sun after it had been set to those at the\r\nbottom.) The rays which the atmosphere receives from the Sun, after he\r\nis withdrawn from our sight, are by refraction faintly transmitted to\r\nus; until the Sun having got about 18 degrees below the horizon, he\r\nno longer enlightens our atmosphere, and then all that part thereof\r\nwhich is over us becomes dark. After the same manner in the morning,\r\nwhen the Sun comes within 18 degrees of our horizon, he again begins\r\nto enlighten the atmosphere, and so more and more by degrees, until he\r\nrises and makes full day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Twilight_, or _Crepusculum_.]\r\n\r\nThis small illumination of the atmosphere, and the state of the Heavens\r\nbetween day and night, is called the _Twilight_, or the _Crepusculum_.\r\n\r\nThe duration of twilight is different in different climates, and in\r\nthe same place at different times of the year. The beginning or ending\r\nof twilight being accurately given, we may from thence easily find the\r\nheight of the atmosphere, which is not always the same. The mean height\r\nof the atmosphere is computed to be about 40 miles; but it is probable,\r\nthe air may extend itself a great deal further, there being properly no\r\nother limits to it, as we can conceive, but as it continually decreases\r\nin density the farther remote it is from the Earth, in a certain ratio;\r\nwhich at last, as to our conception, must in a manner terminate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\nGeographical Definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Situations of Places upon the Earth; of the\r\n        different Situations of its Inhabitants; of Zones\r\n        and Climates._\r\n\r\nThe situations of places upon the Earth, are determined by their\r\nLatitude and Longitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Latitude._]\r\n\r\n1. The _Latitude_ of any place (upon the Earth) is its nearest\r\ndistance, either North or South from the Equator; and if the place\r\nbe in the (Northern/Southern) hemisphere, it is accordingly called\r\n(_North_/_South_) _Latitude_; and is measured by an arch of the\r\nmeridian intercepted betwixt the zenith of the said place, and the\r\nequator. And all places that lie on the same side, and at the same\r\ndistance from the equator, are said to be in the same parallel of\r\nlatitude: the parallels in _Geography_, being the same with the\r\nparallels of declination in _Astronomy_.\r\n\r\nFrom this definition arise the following Corollaries.\r\n\r\n      (1.) _That no place can have above 90 degrees of latitude,\r\n    either North or South._\r\n\r\n      (2.) _Those places that lie under the equinoctial (or\r\n    thro’ which the equator passes) have no latitude, it being\r\n    from thence that the calculation of latitudes is counted;\r\n    and those places that lie under the Poles have the greatest\r\n    latitude, those points being at the greatest distance from\r\n    the equator._\r\n\r\n      (3.) _The latitude of any place is always equal to the\r\n    elevation of the Pole in the same place above the horizon;\r\n    and is therefore often expressed by the Pole’s height, or\r\n    elevation of the Pole; the reason of which is, because from\r\n    the equator to the Pole there is always the distance of 90\r\n    degrees, and from the zenith to the horizon the same number\r\n    of degrees, each of these including the distance from the\r\n    zenith to the Pole: That distance therefore being taken\r\n    away from both, will leave the distance from the zenith to\r\n    the equator, (which is the latitude) equal to the distance\r\n    of the Pole to the horizon._\r\n\r\n      (4.) _The elevation of the equator in any place is always\r\n    equal to the complement of the latitude of the same place._\r\n\r\n      (5.) _A ship sailed directly (towards/from) the equator\r\n    (lessens/augments) her latitude, (or (depresses/raises) the\r\n    Pole) just so much as is her distance sailed._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Difference of Latitude._]\r\n\r\n2. _Difference of latitude_ is the nearest distance betwixt any two\r\nparallels of latitude, shewing how far the one is to the Northward or\r\nSouthward of the other, which can never exceed 180 degrees. And when\r\nthe two places are in the same hemisphere (or on the same side of the\r\nequator) the lesser latitude subtracted from the greater, and when they\r\nare on different sides of the equator, the two latitudes added, gives\r\nthe difference of latitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Longitude._]\r\n\r\n3. The _Longitude_ of any place (upon the Earth) is an arch of the\r\nequator, contained betwixt the meridian of the given place, and some\r\nfixed or known meridian; or, it is equal to the angle formed by the two\r\nmeridians, which properly can never exceed 180 degrees, tho’ sometimes\r\nthe Longitude is counted Easterly quite round the globe.\r\n\r\nSince the meridians are all moveable, and not one that can be fixed\r\nin the heavens, (as the equinoctial circle is fixed, from whence the\r\nlatitudes of all places are determined to be so much either North or\r\nSouth) the longitudes of places cannot so well be fixed from any other\r\nmeridian, but every Geographer is at his liberty to make which he\r\npleases his first meridian, from whence to calculate the longitudes\r\nof other places. Hence it is that geographers of different nations\r\nreckon their longitudes from different meridians, commonly choosing the\r\nmeridian passing through the metropolis of their own country for their\r\nfirst: Thus, the _English_ geographers generally make the meridian of\r\n_London_ to be their first, the _French_ that of _Paris_, and the\r\n_Dutch_ that of _Amsterdam_, &c. and mariners generally reckon the\r\nlongitude from the last known land they saw. This arbitrary way of\r\nreckoning the longitude from different places, makes it necessary,\r\nwhenever we express the longitude of any place, that the place from\r\nwhence it is counted be also expressed.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding definitions arise the following corollaries:\r\n\r\n      1. _If a body should steer directly North, or\r\n    directly South, quite round the globe, he’ll\r\n    continually change his latitude; and pass through the\r\n    two Poles of the world, without deviating the least\r\n    from the meridian of the place he departed from; and\r\n    consequently on his return will not differ in his\r\n    account of time from the people residing in the said\r\n    place._\r\n\r\n      2. _If a body should steer round the globe either\r\n    due East, or due West, he’ll continually change his\r\n    longitude, but will go quite round without altering his\r\n    latitude; and if his course should be due East, he’ll\r\n    gain a day compleatly in his reckoning, or reckon one\r\n    day more than the inhabitants of the place from whence\r\n    he departed; or if his course had been West, he would\r\n    have lost one day, or reckon one less._\r\n\r\nThe reason of which is evident; for admitting our traveller steers due\r\nEast; so many miles in one day as to make his difference of longitude\r\nequivalent to a quarter of an hour of time, it is evident that the\r\nnext day the Sun will rise to him a quarter of an hour sooner than to\r\nthe inhabitants of the place from whence he departed; and so daily,\r\nin proportion to the rate he travels, which in going quite round,\r\nwill make up one natural day. In like manner, if he steers due West\r\nafter the same rate, he’ll lengthen each day a quarter of an hour,\r\nand consequently the Sun will rise to him so much later every day; by\r\nwhich means, in going quite round, he’ll lose one day compleat in his\r\nreckoning. From whence it follows,\r\n\r\n      3. _If two bodies should set out from the same place,\r\n    one steering East, and the other West, and so continue\r\n    their courses quite round, until they arrive at the\r\n    place from whence they set out, they’ll differ two days\r\n    in their reckoning at the time of their return._\r\n\r\n      4. _If a body should steer upon an oblique course (or\r\n    any where betwixt the meridian and the East or West\r\n    points) he’ll continually change both latitude and\r\n    longitude, and that more or less, according to the\r\n    course he steers; and if he should go quite round the\r\n    globe, he’ll differ in his account of time, as by the\r\n    second Corol._\r\n\r\n      5. _The people residing in the Easternmost of any\r\n    two places, will reckon their time so much the sooner\r\n    than those who live in the other place, according to\r\n    the difference of longitude betwixt the two places,\r\n    allowing one hour for every 15 degrees, &c. and the\r\n    contrary._\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Of Zones and Climates_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Zones_, _Torrid_, _Temperate_, and _Frigid_.]\r\n\r\n4. _Zones_ are large tracts of the surface of the Earth, distinguished\r\nby the tropics and polar circles, being five in number; _viz._ one\r\n_Torrid_, two _Temperate_ and two _Frigid_.\r\n\r\nThe _Torrid_, or _Burning Zone_, is all the space comprehended between\r\nthe two tropics; the ancients imagined this tract of the Earth to be\r\nuninhabitable, because of the excessive heat, it being so near the Sun.\r\nAll the inhabitants of the torrid zone have the Sun in their zenith, or\r\nexactly over their heads twice in every year; excepting those who live\r\nexactly under the two tropics, where the Sun comes to their zenith only\r\nonce in a year.\r\n\r\nThe two _Temperate Zones_ lie on either side of the globe, between the\r\ntropics and the polar circles.\r\n\r\nThe two _Frigid Zones_ are those spaces upon the globe that are\r\nincluded between the two polar circles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Amphiscians._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ascians._]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Earth are also distinguished by the diversity\r\nof their _Shadows_. Those who live in the torrid zone, are called\r\n_Amphiscians_, because their noon-shadow is cast different ways,\r\naccording as the Sun is to the northward or southward of their zenith;\r\nbut when the Sun is in their zenith, they are called _Ascians_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Heteroscians._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ascians Heteroscians._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Periscians._]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the temperate zones, are called _Heteroscians_,\r\nbecause their noon-shadow is always cast the same way: But those who\r\nlive under the tropics are called _Ascians Heteroscians_; those who\r\nlive in the frigid zones are called _Periscians_, because sometimes\r\ntheir shadow is cast round about them.\r\n\r\nThese hard names are only _Greek_ words, importing how the Sun casts\r\nthe shadow of the several inhabitants of the Earth; which would be a\r\ntoo trifling distinction to be made here, was it not for the sake of\r\ncomplying with custom.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Earth are also distinguished into three sorts,\r\nin respect to their relative situation to one another, and these are\r\ncalled the _Periœci_, _Antœci_, and _Antipodes_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Periœci._]\r\n\r\n5. The _Periœci_ are those who live under opposite points of the same\r\nparallel of latitude. They have their seasons of the year at the same\r\ntime, and their days and nights always of the same length with one\r\nanother, but the one’s _Noon_ is the other’s _Midnight_; and when the\r\nSun is in the equinoctial, he rises with the one, when he sets with the\r\nother. Those who live under the Poles have no _Periœci_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antœci._]\r\n\r\n6. The _Antœci_ live under the same meridian, and in the same latitude,\r\nbut on different sides of the equator; their Seasons of the year are\r\ncontrary, and the days of the one are equal to the nights of the other,\r\nbut the hour of the day and night is the same with both; and when the\r\nSun is in the equinoctial, he rises and sets to both exactly at the\r\nsame time. Those who live under the equator have no _Antœci_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antipodes._]\r\n\r\n7. The _Antipodes_ are those who live diametrically opposite to one\r\nanother, standing, as it were, exactly feet to feet: Their days and\r\nnights, summer and winter, are at direct contrary times.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Earth is by some distinguished into _Climates_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Climates._]\r\n\r\n8. A _Climate_ is a tract of the surface of the Earth, included between\r\ntwo such parallels of latitude, that the length of the longest day in\r\nthe one exceeds that in the other by half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe whole surface of the Earth is considered, as being divided into\r\n60 climates, _viz._ from the equator to each of the polar circles 24,\r\narising from the difference of ½ hour in the length of their longest\r\ndays; and from the polar circles to the Poles themselves, are six,\r\narising from the difference of an entire month, the Sun being seen\r\nin the first of these a whole month without setting; in the second\r\ntwo; and in the third, three months, _&c._ These climates continually\r\ndecrease in breadth, the farther they are from the equator. How they\r\nare framed, _viz._ the parallel of latitude in which they end (that\r\nbeing likewise the beginning of the next) with the respective breadth\r\nof each of them, is shewed in the following table:\r\n\r\n_A_ TABLE _of the_ CLIMATES.\r\n\r\nCLIMATES _between the Equator and the Polar Circles._\r\n\r\n    ------------+---------+-------------+-----------\r\n    _Climates_  |_Longest_| _Latitude._ |  _Breadth_\r\n                |  _Day._ |  _D.

A Star _rises Heliacally_, when first it\r\nbecomes visible, after it had been so near the Sun as to be hid by the\r\nsplendor of his rays: And a Star is said to _set Heliacally_, when it\r\nis first immersed, or hid by the Sun’s rays.\r\n\r\nThe _Fixed Stars_, and the three superior Planets, _Mars_, _Jupiter_,\r\nand _Saturn_, rise _Heliacally_ in the morning; but the Moon rises\r\n_Heliacally_ in the evening, because the Sun is swifter than the\r\nsuperior Planets, and slower than the Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Of the surface of the Earth, considered as it is composed of Land\r\nand Water._\r\n\r\nThe Earth consists naturally of two parts, Land and Water, and\r\ntherefore it is called the _Terraqueous Globe_. Each of these elements\r\nis subdivided into various forms and parts, which accordingly are\r\ndistinguished by different names.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Of the Land._\r\n\r\nThe land is distinguished into _Continents_, _Islands_, _Peninsula’s_,\r\n_Isthmus’s_, _Promontories_, _Mountains_, or _Coasts_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Continent._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Main Land._]\r\n\r\n9. A _Continent_ is a large quantity of land, in which many great\r\ncountries are joined together, without being separated from each other\r\nby the sea: such are _Europe_, _Asia_, _Africa_, and the vast continent\r\nof _America_; which four are the principal divisions of the Earth. A\r\ncontinent is sometimes called the _Main Land_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Island._]\r\n\r\n10. An _Island_ is a country, or portion of land, environed round with\r\nwater: such are _Great-Britain_ and _Ireland_; _Sardinia_, _Sicily_,\r\n&c. in the _Mediterranean Sea_; the _Isles_ of _Wight_, _Anglesey_,\r\n&c. near _England_. Also a small part of dry land, in the midst of a\r\nriver, is called an island, when compared to a lesser, is called the\r\ncontinent; as if we compare the _Isle_ of _Wight_ to _England_, the\r\nlatter may be properly called the continent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Peninsula._]\r\n\r\n11. A _Peninsula_ is a part of land almost environed with water, save\r\none narrow neck adjoining it to the continent; or which is almost\r\nan island: such is _Denmark_ joining to _Germany_; also _Africa_ is\r\nproperly a large peninsula joining to _Asia_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Isthmus._]\r\n\r\n12. An _Isthmus_ is a narrow neck of land joining a peninsula to the\r\ncontinent; as the _Isthmus_ of _Sues_, which joins _Africa_ to _Asia_,\r\nthat of _Panama_, joining North and South _America_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Promontory._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mountain._]\r\n\r\n13. A _Promontory_ is a high part of land stretching out into the sea,\r\nand is often called a _Cape_ or _Headland_: such is the _Cape_ of\r\n_Good Hope_ in the South of _Africa_; _Cape Finistre_ on the West of\r\n_Spain_; also the _Lizard Point_, and the _Land’s End_, are two Capes\r\nor Headlands on the West of _England_. A _Mountain_ is a high part of\r\nland in the midst of a country, over topping the adjacent parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Coast_ or _Shore_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Inland._]\r\n\r\n14. A _Coast_ or _Shore_ is that part of land which borders upon the\r\nsea, whether it be in islands or a continent: And that part of the land\r\nwhich is far distant from the sea, is called the _Inland Country_.\r\nThese are the usual distinctions of the land.\r\n\r\nThe Water is distinguished into _Oceans_, _Seas_, _Lakes_, _Gulfs_,\r\n_Straits_, and _Rivers_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Ocean_, or _Main Sea_.]\r\n\r\n15. The _Ocean_, or _Main Sea_, is a vast spreading collection of\r\nwater, not divided or separated by lands running between; such is the\r\n_Atlantic_ or _Western Ocean_; between _Europe_ and _America_; the\r\n_Pacific Ocean_, or _South Sea_, &c.\r\n\r\n_Note_, Those parts of the ocean which border upon the land, are called\r\nby various names, according to those of the adjacent countries; as, the\r\n_British Sea_, the _Irish Sea_, the _French_ and _Spanish Sea_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Lake._]\r\n\r\n16. A _Lake_ is a collection of deep standing water, inclosed all round\r\nwith land, and not having any visible and open communication with the\r\nsea: But when this lake is very large, it is commonly called a sea; as\r\nthe _Caspian Sea_ in _Asia_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Gulf._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Creek_ or _Haven_.]\r\n\r\n17. A _Gulf_ is a part of the sea almost encompassed with land, or that\r\nwhich runs up a great way into the land; as, the _Gulf_ of _Venice,\r\n&c._ But if it be very large, ’tis rather called an _Inland Sea_;\r\nas the _Baltic Sea_, the _Mediterranean Sea_, the _Red Sea_, or the\r\n_Arabian Gulf, &c._ And a small part of sea thus environed with land is\r\nusually called a _Bay_. If it be but a very small Part, or, as it were,\r\na small arm of the sea, that runs but a few miles between the land, it\r\nis called a _Creek_ or _Haven_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Strait._]\r\n\r\n18. A _Strait_ is a narrow passage lying between two shores, whereby\r\ntwo seas are joined together; as, the _Straits_ of _Dover_, between the\r\n_British Channel_ and the _German Sea_; the _Straits_ of _Gibralter_,\r\nbetween the _Atlantic_ and the _Mediterranean Sea_. The _Mediterranean_\r\nitself is also sometimes called the _Straits_.\r\n\r\nThese are all the necessary terms commonly used in _Geography_. The\r\nnames of the several countries and seas, and all the principal\r\ndivisions of the Earth, the reader will find expressed upon the\r\nTerrestrial Globes. To give a tolerable account of the produce of each\r\ncountry, the genius of the people, their political institutions, _&c._\r\nis properly a particular subject of itself, and quite foreign to our\r\ndesign. We shall next proceed to the use of the Globes; but first it\r\nmay not be amiss to take a short _review_ of their appurtenances.\r\n\r\nThose circles of the sphere that are _fixed_, are (as has been already\r\nsaid) drawn upon the _Globes_ themselves; those that are _moveable_,\r\nare supplied by the _Brass Meridian_, the _Wooden Horizon_, and the\r\n_Quadrant of Altitude_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Brass Meridian._]\r\n\r\n1. That side of the _Brazen Meridian_, which is divided into degrees,\r\nrepresents the _true Meridian_; this side is commonly turned towards\r\nthe East, and ’tis usual to place the globe so before you, that the\r\nNorth be to the right hand, and the South to the left. The meridian\r\nis divided into 4 quadrants, each being 90 degrees, two of which are\r\nnumbered from that part of the equinoctial, which is above the horizon,\r\ntowards each of the Poles; the other two quadrants are numbered from\r\nthe Poles towards the equator. The reason why two quadrants of the\r\nmeridian are numbered from the equator, and the other two from the\r\nPoles, is because the former of these two serve to shew the distance of\r\nany point on the globe from the equator, and the other to elevate the\r\nglobe to the latitude of the place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Wooden Horizon._]\r\n\r\n2. The upper side of the wooden frame called the _Wooden Horizon_;\r\nrepresents the true horizon; the circles drawn upon this plane have\r\nbeen already described; we may observe, that the first point of ♈ is\r\nthe East, and the opposite being the first point of ♎ is the West, the\r\nmeridian passing through the North and South points.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Quadrant of Altitude._]\r\n\r\n3. The _Quadrant of Altitude_ is a flexible plate of thin brass, having\r\na nut and screw at one end, to be fastened to the meridian of either\r\nglobe, as occasion requires. The edge of this quadrant which has the\r\ngraduations upon it, called the fiducial edge, is that which is always\r\nmeant whenever we make mention of the quadrant of altitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hour Circle._]\r\n\r\n4. The _Horary_ or _Hour Circle_, is divided into twice twelve hours,\r\nthe two XII’s coinciding with the meridian; the uppermost XII is that\r\nat _Noon_, and the lowermost towards the horizon is XII at _Night_.\r\nThe hours on the _East_ side of the meridian are the _Morning Hours_,\r\nand those on the _West_ side the _Hours_ after _Noon_. The axis of the\r\nglobe carries round the _Hand_ or _Index_ which points the hour, and\r\npasses through the center of the hour circle.\r\n\r\nThe things above described are common to both globes; but there are\r\nsome others which are peculiar or proper to one sort of globe. The two\r\n_Colures_, and the _Circles_ of _Latitude_ from the ecliptic, belong\r\nonly to the _Celestial Globes_; also the ecliptic itself does properly\r\nbelong only to this globe, tho’ it is always drawn on the Terrestrial,\r\nfor the sake of those that might not have the other globe by them. The\r\nequinoctial on the celestial globe is always numbered into 360 degrees,\r\nbeginning at the equinoctial point ♈; but on the terrestrial, it is\r\narbitrary, where these numbers commence, according to the meridian of\r\nwhat place you intend for your first; and the degrees may be counted\r\neither quite round to 360, or both ways, ’till they meet in the\r\nopposite part of the meridian, at 180.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_The USE of the_ GLOBES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROBLEM I. _To find the Latitude and Longitude\r\n        of any given Place upon the Globe; and on the\r\n        contrary, the Latitude and Longitude being given,\r\n        to find the Place._\r\n\r\n1. Turn the globe round its axis, ’till the given place lies exactly\r\nunder the (Eastern side of the brass) meridian, then that degree upon\r\nthe meridian, which is directly over it, is the _Latitude_; which is\r\naccordingly North or South, as it lies in the Northern or Southern\r\nhemisphere, the globe remaining in the same position.\r\n\r\nThat degree upon the equator which is cut by the brazen meridian,\r\nis the _Longitude_ required from the first meridian upon the globe.\r\nIf the longitude is counted both ways from the first meridian upon\r\nthe globe, then we are to consider, whether the given place lies\r\nEasterly or Westerly from the first meridian, and the longitude must be\r\nexpressed accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe _Latitudes_ of the following places: and upon a globe where the\r\nlongitude is reckoned both ways from the meridian of _London_, their\r\nlongitudes will be found as follow:\r\n\r\n                 _Latitude._  _Longitude._\r\n                  Deg.           Deg.\r\n    _Rome_        41¾ North.      13  East.\r\n    _Paris_       48¾ N.           2½ E.\r\n    _Mexico_      20  N.         102  W.\r\n    _Cape Horn_   58  S.          80  W.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Latitude and Longitude being given to find the Place._\r\n\r\nSeek for the given longitude in the equator, and bring that point to\r\nthe meridian; then count from the equator on the meridian the degree of\r\nlatitude given, towards the arctic and antarctic Pole, according as the\r\nlatitude is Northerly or Southerly, and under that degree of latitude\r\nlies the _Place_ required.\r\n\r\n    PROB. II. _To find the Difference of Latitude\r\n        betwixt any two given Places._\r\n\r\nBring each of the places proposed successively to the meridian, and\r\nobserve where they intersect it, then the number of degrees upon\r\nthe meridian, contained between the two intersections, will be the\r\n_Difference of Latitude_ required. Or, if the places proposed are on\r\nthe same side of the equator, having first found their latitudes,\r\nsubtract the lesser from the greater; but if they are on contrary sides\r\nof the equator, add them both together, and the difference in the first\r\ncase, and the sum in the latter, will be the difference of latitude\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThus the difference of latitude betwixt _London_ and _Rome_ will be\r\nfound to be 9¾ degrees; betwixt _Paris_ and _Cape Bona Esperance_ 83\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. III. _To find the Difference of\r\n        Longitude betwixt any two given Places._\r\n\r\nBring each of the given places successively to the meridian, and see\r\nwhere the meridian cuts the equator each time; the number of degrees\r\ncontained betwixt those two points, if it be less than 180 degrees,\r\notherwise the remainder to 360 degrees, will be the difference of\r\nlongitude required. Or,\r\n\r\nHaving brought one of the given places to the meridian, bring the\r\nindex of the hour circle to 12 o’clock; then having brought the other\r\nplace to the meridian, the number of hours contained between the place\r\nthe index was first set at, and the place where it now points, is the\r\ndifference of longitude in time betwixt the two places.\r\n\r\nThus the difference of longitude betwixt _Rome_ and _Constantinople_\r\nwill be found to be 19 degrees, or 1 hour and a quarter; betwixt\r\n_Mexico_ and _Pekin_ in _China_, 240 degrees, or 9⅓ hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. IV. _Any Place being given to find all\r\n        those Places that are in the same Latitude with the\r\n        same Place._\r\n\r\nThe latitude of any given place being marked upon the meridian, turn\r\nthe globe round its axis, and all those places that pass under the same\r\nmark are in the same latitude with the given place, and have their\r\ndays and nights of equal lengths. And when any place is brought to\r\nthe meridian, all the inhabitants that lie under the upper semicircle\r\nof it, have their Noon or mid-day at the same point of absolute time\r\nexactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. V. _The day of the Month being given;\r\n        to find the Sun’s Place in the Ecliptic, and his\r\n        Declination._\r\n\r\n1. _To find the Sun’s Place_: Look for the day of the month given in\r\nthe kalendar of months upon the horizon, and right against it you’ll\r\nfind that sign and degree of the ecliptic which the Sun is in. The\r\nSun’s place being thus found, look for the same in the ecliptic line\r\nwhich is drawn upon the globe, and bring that point to the meridian,\r\nthen that degree of the meridian, which is directly over the Sun’s\r\nplace, is the _Declination_ required; which is accordingly either North\r\nor South, as the Sun is in the Northern or Southern signs. Thus,\r\n\r\n                      _Sun’s Place._  _Declination._\r\n                         Deg. Min.      Deg. Min.\r\n    _April 23_       ♉   3   00        12   32 N.\r\n    _July 31_        ♌   7   51        18   20 N.\r\n    _October 26_     ♏   2   49        12   28 S.\r\n    _January 20_     ♒   0   49        20   07 S.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. VI. _To rectify the Globe for the\r\n        Latitude, Zenith, and the Sun’s Place._\r\n\r\n1. _For the Latitude_: If the place be in the Northern hemisphere,\r\nraise the arctic Pole above the horizon; but for the South latitude you\r\nmust raise the antarctic; then move the meridian up and down in the\r\nnotches, until the degrees of the latitude counted upon the meridian\r\nbelow the Pole, cuts the horizon, and the globe is adjusted to the\r\nlatitude.\r\n\r\n2. _To rectify the Globe for the Zenith_: Having elevated the globe\r\naccording to the latitude, count the degrees thereof upon the meridian\r\nfrom the equator, towards the elevated Pole, and that point will be the\r\nzenith or the vertex of the place; to this point of the meridian fasten\r\nthe quadrant of altitude, so that the graduated edge thereof may be\r\njoined to the said point.\r\n\r\n3. Bring the Sun’s place in the ecliptic to the meridian, and then set\r\nthe hour index to XII at Noon, and the globe will be rectified _to the\r\nSun’s Place_. If you have a little mariner’s compass, the meridian of\r\nthe globe may be easily set to the meridian of the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. VII. _To find the Distance between any\r\n        two given places upon the Globe, and to find all\r\n        those places upon the globe that are at the same\r\n        distance from a given place._\r\n\r\nLay the quadrant of altitude over both the places, and the number of\r\ndegrees intercepted between them being reduced into miles, will be the\r\ndistance required: Or, you may take the distance betwixt the two places\r\nwith a pair of compasses, and applying that extent to the equator,\r\nyou’ll have the degrees of distance as before.\r\n\r\n_Note_, A _geographical mile_ is the ¹/₆₀th part of a degree; whereof\r\nif you multiply the number of degrees by 60, the product will be the\r\nnumber of geographical miles of distance sought; but to reduce the\r\nsame into _English_ miles, you must multiply by 70, because about 70\r\n_English_ miles make a degree of a great circle upon the superficies of\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nThus, the distance betwixt _London_ and _Rome_ will be found to be\r\nabout 13 degrees, which is 780 geographical miles.\r\n\r\nIf you rectify the globe for the latitude and zenith of any given\r\nplace, and bring the said place to the meridian; then turning the\r\nquadrant of altitude about, all those places that are cut by the same\r\npoint of it, are at the same distance from the given place.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. VIII. _To find the angle of position of\r\n        Places, or the angle formed by the meridian of one\r\n        Place, and a great circle passing through both the\r\n        Places._\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the globe for the latitude and zenith of one of the\r\ngiven places, bring the said place to the meridian, then turn the\r\nquadrant of altitude about, until the fiducial edge thereof cuts the\r\nother place, and the number of degrees upon the horizon, contained\r\nbetween the said edge and the meridian, will be the angle of position\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nThus, the angle of position at the _Lizard_, between the meridian of\r\nthe _Lizard_ and the great circle, passing from thence to _Barbadoes_\r\nis 69 degrees South-Westerly; but the angle of position between the\r\nsame places at _Barbadoes_, is but 38 degrees North-Easterly.\r\n\r\n_SCHOLIUM_\r\n\r\nThe angle of position between two places is a different thing from\r\nwhat is meant by the bearings of places; the _Bearings_ of two places\r\nis determined by a sort of spiral line, called a _Rhumb Line_, passing\r\nbetween them in such a manner, as to make the same or equal angles\r\nwith all the meridians through which it passeth; but the _angle_ or\r\n_position_ is the very same thing with what we call the azimuth in\r\nastronomy, both being formed by the meridian and a great circle passing\r\nthro’ the zenith of a given place in the heavens, then called the\r\nazimuth, or upon the Earth, then called the angle of position.\r\n\r\nFrom hence may be shewed the error of that geographical paradox, _viz._\r\nIf a place A bears from another B due West, B shall not bear from A\r\ndue East. I find this paradox vindicated by an author, who at the\r\nsame time gives a true definition of a rhumb line: But his arguments\r\nare ungeometrical; for if it be admitted that the East and West lines\r\nmake the same angles with all the meridians through which they pass,\r\nit will follow that these lines are the parallels of latitude: For\r\nany parallel of latitude is the continuation of the surface of a\r\n_Cone_, whose sides are the radii of the sphere, and circumference of\r\nits base the said parallel; and it is evident, that all the meridians\r\ncut the said surface at right (and therefore at equal) angles; whence\r\nit follows, that the rhumbs of East and West are the parallels of\r\nlatitude, though the case may seem different, when we draw inclining\r\nlines (like meridians) upon paper, without carrying our ideas any\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. IX. _To find the_ Antœci, Periœci, _and_\r\n        Antipodes _to any given place._\r\n\r\nBring the given place to the meridian; and having found its latitude,\r\ncount the same number of degrees on the meridian from the equator\r\ntowards the contrary Pole, and that will give the place of the\r\n_Antœci_. The globe being still in the same position, set the hour\r\nindex to XII at noon, then turn the globe about ’till the index points\r\nto the lower XII; the place which then lies under the meridian, having\r\nthe same latitude with the given place, is the _Periœci_ required. As\r\nthe globe now stands, the _Antipodes_ of the given place are under\r\nthe same point of the meridian, that its _Antœci_ stood before: Or,\r\nif you reckon 180 degrees upon the meridian from the given place,\r\nthat point will be the _Antipodes_. Let the given place be _London_,\r\nin the latitude of 51½ degrees North, that place which lies under the\r\nsame meridian and the latitude 51½ degrees South, is the _Antœci_;\r\nthat which lies in the same parallel with _London_, and 180 degrees of\r\nlongitude from it, is the _Periœci_, and the _Antipodes_ is the place\r\nwhose longitude from _London_ is 180 degrees, and latitude 51½ degrees\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. X. _The Hour of the Day at one place\r\n        being given; to find the correspondent Hour (or\r\n        what o’Clock it is at that time) in any other\r\n        place._\r\n\r\nThe difference of time betwixt two places is the same with their\r\ndifference of longitude; wherefore having found their difference\r\nof longitude, reduced into time (by allowing one hour for every\r\n15 degrees, _&c._) and if the place where the hour is required\r\nlies (Easterly/Westerly) from the place where the hour is given,\r\n(add/subtract) the difference of longitude reduced into time (to/from)\r\nthe hour given; and the sum or remainder will accordingly be the hour\r\nrequired. Or,\r\n\r\nHaving brought the place at which the hour is given to the meridian,\r\nset the hour index to the given hour; then turn the globe about until\r\nthe place where the hour is required comes to the meridian, and the\r\nindex will point out the hour at the said place.\r\n\r\nThus when it is _Noon_ at _London_, it is\r\n\r\n                               H. M.\r\n       { _Rome_                 0 52 P. M.\r\n    At { _Constantinople_       2 07 P. M.\r\n       { _Vera-Cruz_            5 30 A. M.\r\n       { _Pekin_ in _China_     7 50 P. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XI. _The Day of the Month being given,\r\n        to find those places on the globe where the Sun\r\n        will be Vertical, or in the Zenith, that day._\r\n\r\nHaving found the Sun’s place in the ecliptic, bring the same to the\r\nmeridian, and note the degree over it; then turning the globe round,\r\nall places that pass under that degree will have the Sun vertical that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XII. _A place being given in the_ Torrid\r\n        Zone, _to find those two Days in which the Sun\r\n        shall be Vertical to the same._\r\n\r\nBring the given place to the meridian, and mark what degree of latitude\r\nis exactly over it; then turning the globe about its axis, those two\r\npoints of the ecliptic, which pass exactly under the said mark, are the\r\nSun’s place; against which, upon the wooden horizon, you’ll have the\r\ndays required.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XIII. _To find where the Sun is Vertical at\r\n        any given time assigned; or the Day of the Month\r\n        and the Hour at any Place_ (_suppose_ London) _being\r\n        given, to find in what place the Sun is Vertical at\r\n        that very time._\r\n\r\nHaving found the Sun’s declination, and brought the first place\r\n(_London_) to the meridian, set the index to the given hour, then turn\r\nthe globe about until the index points to XII at noon; which being\r\ndone, that place upon the globe which stands under the point of the\r\nSun’s declination upon the meridian, has the Sun that moment in the\r\nZenith.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XIV. _The Day, and the Hour of the\r\n        Day at one place, being given; to find all those\r\n        places upon the Earth, where the Sun is then\r\n        Rising, Setting, Culminating (or on the meridian)\r\n        also where it is Day-light, Twilight, Dark Night,\r\n        Midnight; where the Twilight then begins, and where\r\n        it ends; the height of the Sun in any part of the\r\n        illuminated hemisphere; also his depression in the\r\n        obscure hemisphere._\r\n\r\nHaving found the place where the Sun is vertical at the given hour,\r\nrectify the globe for that latitude, and bring the said place to the\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\nThen all those places that are in the Western semicircle of the\r\nhorizon, have the Sun rising at that time.\r\n\r\nThose in the Eastern semicircle have it setting.\r\n\r\nTo those who live under the upper semicircle of the meridian, it is 12\r\no’clock at noon. And,\r\n\r\nThose who live under the lower semicircle of the meridian, have it at\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nAll those places that are above the horizon, have the Sun above them,\r\njust so much as the places themselves are distant from the horizon;\r\nwhich height may be known by fixing the quadrant of altitude in the\r\nzenith, and laying it over any particular place.\r\n\r\nIn all those places that are 18 degrees below the Western side of the\r\nhorizon, the twilight is just beginning in the morning, or the day\r\nbreaks. And in all those places that are 18 degrees below the Eastern\r\nside of the horizon, the twilight is ending, and the total darkness\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe twilight is in all those places whose depression below the horizon\r\ndoes not exceed 18 degrees. And,\r\n\r\nAll those places that are lower than 18 degrees, have dark night.\r\n\r\nThe depression of any place below the horizon is equal to the altitude\r\nof its _Antipodes_, which may be easily found by the quadrant of\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XV. _The Day of the Month being given;\r\n        to show, at one view, the length of Days and Nights\r\n        in all places upon the Earth at that time; and to\r\n        explain how the vicissitudes of Day and Night are\r\n        really made by the motion of the Earth round her\r\n        axis in 24 hours, the Sun standing still._\r\n\r\nThe Sun always illuminates one half of the globe, or that hemisphere\r\nwhich is next towards him, while the other remains in darkness: And if\r\n(as by the last problem) we elevate the globe according to the Sun’s\r\nplace in the ecliptic, it is evident, that the Sun (he being at an\r\nimmense distance from the Earth) illuminates all that hemisphere, which\r\nis above the horizon; the wooden horizon itself, will be the circle\r\nterminating light and darkness; and all those places that are below it,\r\nare wholly deprived of the solar light.\r\n\r\nThe globe standing in this position, those arches of the parallels\r\nof latitude which stand above the horizon, are the _Diurnal Arches_,\r\nor the length of the day in all those latitudes at that time of the\r\nyear; and the remaining parts of those parallels, which are below the\r\nhorizon, are the _Nocturnal Arches_, or the length of the night in\r\nthose places. The length of the diurnal arches may be found by counting\r\nhow many hours are contained between the two meridians, cutting any\r\nparallel of latitude, in the Eastern and Western parts of the horizon.\r\n\r\nIn all those places that are in the Western semicircle of the horizon,\r\nthe Sun appears rising: For the Sun, standing still in the vertex (or\r\nabove the brass meridian) appears Easterly, and 90 degrees distant from\r\nall those places that are in the Western semicircle of the horizon;\r\nand therefore in those places he is then rising. Now, if we pitch upon\r\nany particular place upon the globe, and bring it to the meridian,\r\nand then bring the hour index to the lower 12, which in this case,\r\nwe’ll suppose to be 12 at noon; (because otherwise the numbers upon\r\nthe hour circle will not answer our purpose) and afterwards turn the\r\nglobe about, until the aforesaid place be brought to the Western side\r\nof the horizon; the index will then shew the time of the Sun rising\r\nin that place. Then turn the globe gradually about from West to East,\r\nand minding the hour index, we shall see the progress made in the day\r\nevery hour, in all latitudes upon the globe, by the real motion of the\r\nEarth round its axis; until, by their continual approach to the brass\r\nmeridian (over which the Sun stands still all the while) they at last\r\nhave noon day, and the Sun appears at the highest; and then by degrees,\r\nas they move Easterly the Sun seems to decline Westward, until, as the\r\nplaces successively arrive in the Eastern part of the horizon, the Sun\r\nappears to set in the Western: For the places that are in the horizon,\r\nare 90 degrees distant from the Sun. We may observe, that all places\r\nupon the Earth, that differ in latitude, have their days of different\r\nlength (except when the Sun is in the equinoctial) being longer or\r\nshorter, in proportion to what part of the parallels stands above the\r\nhorizon. Those that are in the same latitude, have their days of the\r\nsame length; but have them commence sooner or later, according as the\r\nplaces differ in longitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XVI. _To explain in general the\r\n        alteration of Seasons, or length of the Days\r\n        and Nights made in all places of the World, by\r\n        the Sun’s (or the Earth’s) annual motion in the\r\n        Ecliptic._\r\n\r\nIt has been shewed in the last problem, how to place the globe\r\nin such a position as to exhibit the length of the diurnal and\r\nnocturnal arches in all places of the Earth, at a particular time:\r\nIf the globe be continually rectified, according as the Sun alters\r\nhis declination, (which may be known by bringing each degree of the\r\necliptic successively to the meridian) you’ll see the gradual increase\r\nor decrease made in the days, in all places of the World, according as\r\na greater or lesser portion of the parallels of latitude, stands above\r\nthe horizon. We shall illustrate this problem by examples taken at\r\ndifferent times of the year.\r\n\r\n1. Let the Sun be in the first point of ♋ (which happens on the 21st of\r\n_June_) that point being brought to the meridian, will shew the Sun’s\r\ndeclination to be 23½ degrees North; then the globe must be rectified\r\nto the latitude of 23½ degrees; and for the better illustration of the\r\nproblem, let the first meridian upon the globe be brought under the\r\nbrass meridian. The globe being in this position, you’ll see at one\r\nview the length of the days in all latitudes, by counting the number\r\nof hours contained between the two extreme meridians, cutting any\r\nparticular parallel you pitch upon, in the Eastern and Western part\r\nof the horizon. And you may observe that the lower part of the arctic\r\ncircle just touches the horizon, and consequently all the people who\r\nlive in that latitude have the Sun above their horizon for the space\r\nof 24 hours, without setting; only when he is in the lower part of\r\nthe meridian (which they would call 12 at night) he just touches the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nTo all those who live between the arctic circle and the Pole, the Sun\r\ndoes not set, and its height above the horizon, when he is in the\r\nlower part of the meridian, is equal to their distance from the arctic\r\ncircle: For example, Those who live in the 83d parallel have the Sun\r\nwhen he is lowest at this time 13½ degrees high.\r\n\r\nIf we cast our eye Southward, towards the equator, we shall find, that\r\nthe diurnal arches, or the length of days in the several latitudes,\r\ngradually lessen: The diurnal arch of the parallel of _London_ at this\r\ntime is 16½ hours; that of the _Equator_ (is always) 12 hours; and so\r\ncontinually less, ’till we come to the _Antarctic Circle_, the upper\r\npart of which just touches the horizon; just those who live in this\r\nlatitude have just one sight of the Sun, peeping as it were in the\r\nhorizon: And all that space between the antarctic circle and the South\r\nPole, lies in total darkness.\r\n\r\nIf from this position we gradually move the meridian of the globe\r\naccording to the progressive alterations made in the Sun’s declination,\r\nby his motion in the ecliptic, we shall find the diurnal arches of\r\nall those parallels, that are on the Northern side of the equator,\r\ncontinually decrease; and those on the Southern side continually\r\nincrease, in the same manner as the days in those places shorten and\r\nlengthen. Let us again observe the globe when the Sun has got within\r\n10 degrees of the equinoctial; now the lower part of the 80th parallel\r\nof North latitude just touches the horizon, and all the space betwixt\r\nthis and the pole, falls in the illuminated hemisphere: but all those\r\nparallels that lie betwixt this and the arctic circle, which before\r\nwere wholly above the horizon, do now intersect it, and the Sun\r\nappears to them to rise and set. From hence to the equator, we shall\r\nfind that the days have gradually shortened; and from the equator\r\nSouthward, they have gradually lengthened, until we come to the 80th\r\nparallel of the South latitude; the upper part of which just touches\r\nthe horizon; and all places betwixt this and the South Pole are in\r\ntotal darkness; but those parallels betwixt this and the antarctic\r\ncircle, which before were wholly upon the horizon, are now partly\r\nabove it; the length of their days being exactly equal to that of the\r\nnights in the same latitude in the contrary hemisphere. This also holds\r\nuniversally, that the length of one day in one latitude North, is\r\nexactly equal to the length of the night in the same latitude South;\r\nand _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nLet us again follow the motion of the Sun, until he has got into the\r\nequinoctial, and take a view of the globe while it is in this position.\r\nNow all the parallels of latitude are cut into two equal parts by the\r\nhorizon, and consequently the days and nights are of equal lengths,\r\n_viz._ 12 hours each, in all places of the world; the Sun rising and\r\nsetting at six o’clock, excepting under the two _Poles_, which now lie\r\nexactly in the horizon: Here the Sun seems to stand still in the same\r\npoint of the heavens for some time, until by degrees, by his motion in\r\nthe ecliptic, he ascends higher to one and disappears to the other,\r\nthere being properly no days and nights under the Poles; for there the\r\nmotion of the Earth round its axis cannot be observed.\r\n\r\nIf we follow the motion of the Sun towards the Southern tropic, we\r\nshall see the diurnal arches of the Northern parallels continually\r\ndecrease, and the Southern ones increase in the same proportion,\r\naccording to their respective latitudes; the North Pole continually\r\ndescending, and the South Pole ascending, above the horizon, until the\r\nSun arrives into ♑, at which time all the space within the antarctic\r\ncircle is above the horizon; while the space between the arctic circle,\r\nand its neighbouring Pole, is in total darkness. And we shall now find\r\nall other circumstances quite reverse to what they were when the Sun\r\nwas in ♋; the nights now all over the world being of the same length\r\nthat the days were of before.\r\n\r\nWe have now got to the extremity of the Sun’s declination; and if we\r\nfollow him through the other half of the ecliptic, and rectify the\r\nglobe accordingly, we shall find the seasons return in their order,\r\nuntil at length we bring the globe into its first position.\r\n\r\nThe two foregoing problems were not, as I know of, published in any\r\nbook on this subject before; and I have dwelt the longer upon them,\r\nbecause they very well illustrate how the vicissitudes of days and\r\nnights are made all over the world, by the motion of the Earth round\r\nher axis; the horizon of the globe being made the circle, separating\r\nlight and darkness, and so the Sun to stand still in the vertex. And\r\nif we really could move the meridian, according to the change of the\r\nSun’s declination, we should see at one view, the continual change made\r\nin the length of days and nights, in all places on the Earth; but as\r\nglobes are fitted up, this cannot be done; neither are they adapted\r\nfor the common purposes, in places near the equator, or any where in\r\nthe Southern hemisphere. But this inconvenience is now remedied (at a\r\nsmall additional expence) by the hour circle being made to shift to\r\neither Pole; and some globes are now made with an hour circle fixed to\r\nthe globe at each Pole between the globe and meridian, so as to have\r\nnone without side to interrupt the meridian from moving quite round the\r\nwooden horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XVII. _To shew by the globe, at one\r\n        view, the longest of the Days and Nights in any\r\n        particular places, at all times of the Year._\r\n\r\nBecause the Sun, by his motion in the ecliptic, alters his declination\r\na small matter every day; if we suppose all the torrid zone to be\r\nfilled up with a spiral line, having so many turnings; or a screw\r\nhaving so many threads, as the Sun is days in going from one tropic\r\nto the other: And these threads at the same distance from one another\r\nin all places, as the Sun alters his declination in one day in all\r\nthose places respectively: This spiral line or screw will represent\r\nthe apparent paths described by the Sun round the Earth every day; and\r\nby following the thread from one tropic to the other, and back again,\r\nwe shall have the path the Sun seems to describe round the Earth in a\r\nyear. But because the inclinations of these threads to one another are\r\nbut small, we may suppose each diurnal path to be one of the parallels\r\nof latitude, drawn, or supposed to be drawn upon the globe. Thus much\r\nbeing premised, we shall explain this _Problem_, by placing the globe\r\naccording to some of the most remarkable positions of it, as before we\r\ndid for the most remarkable seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding problem, the globe being rectified according to the\r\nSun’s declination, the upper parts of the parallels of latitude,\r\nrepresented the _Diurnal Arches_, or the length of the days all over\r\nthe world, at that particular time: Here we are to rectify the globe\r\naccording to the latitude of the place, and then the upper parts of the\r\nparallels of declination are the diurnal arches; and the length of the\r\ndays at all times of the year, may be here determined by finding the\r\nnumber of hours contained between the two extreme meridians, which cut\r\nany parallel of declination in the Eastern and Western points of the\r\nhorizon; after the same manner, as before we found the length of the\r\nday in the several latitudes at a particular time of the year.\r\n\r\n1. Let the place proposed be under the equinoctial, and let the globe\r\nbe accordingly rectified for 00 degrees of latitude, which is called\r\na direct position of the sphere. Here all the parallels of latitude,\r\nwhich in this case we will call the parallels of declination, are cut\r\nby the horizon into two equal parts; and consequently those who live\r\nunder the equinoctial, have the days and nights of the same length at\r\nall times of the year; and also in this part of the Earth, all the\r\n_Stars_ rise and set, and their continuance above the horizon, is equal\r\nto their stay below it, _viz._ 12 hours.\r\n\r\nIf from this position we gradually move the globe according to\r\nthe several alterations of latitudes, which we will suppose to be\r\nNortherly; the lengths of the _Diurnal Arches_ will continually\r\nincrease, until we come to a parallel of declination, as far distant\r\nfrom the equinoctial, as the place itself is from the Pole. This\r\nparallel will just touch the horizon, and all the heavenly bodies that\r\nare betwixt it and the Pole never descend below the horizon. In the\r\nmean time, while we are moving the globe, the lengths of the diurnal\r\narches of the Southern parallels of declination, continually diminish\r\nin the same proportion that the Northern ones increased; until we\r\ncome to that parallel of declination which is so far distant from the\r\nequinoctial Southerly, as the place itself is from the North Pole. The\r\nupper part of this _Parallel_ just touches the horizon, and all the\r\nStars that are betwixt it and the South Pole never appear above the\r\nhorizon. And all the nocturnal arches of the Southern parallels of\r\ndeclination, are exactly of the same length with the diurnal arches of\r\nthe correspondent parallels of North declination.\r\n\r\n2. Let us take a view of the globe when it is rectified for the\r\nlatitude of _London_, or 51½ degrees North. When the Sun is in the\r\ntropic of ♋, the day is about 16½ hours; as he recedes from this\r\ntropic, the days proportionably shorten, until, he arrives into ♑, and\r\nthen the days are at the shortest, being now of the same length with\r\nthe night, when the Sun was in ♋, _viz._ 7½ hours. The lower part of\r\nthat parallel of declination, which is 38½ degrees from the equinoctial\r\nNortherly, just touches the horizon; and the Stars that are betwixt\r\nthis parallel and the North Pole, never set to us at _London_. In like\r\nmanner the upper part of the Southern parallel of 38½ degrees just\r\ntouches the horizon, and the Stars that lie betwixt this parallel and\r\nthe Southern Pole, are never visible in this latitude.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us rectify the globe for the latitude of the _Arctic\r\nCircle_, we shall then find, that when the Sun is in ♋, he touches the\r\nhorizon on that day without setting, being 24 hours compleat above the\r\nhorizon; and when he is in _Capricorn_, he once appears in the horizon,\r\nbut does not rise in the space of 24 hours: When he is in any other\r\npoint of the ecliptic, the days are longer or shorter, according to his\r\ndistance from the tropics. All the Stars that lie between the tropic\r\nof _Cancer_, and the North Pole, never set in this latitude; and those\r\nthat are between the tropic of _Capricorn_, and the South Pole, are\r\nalways hid below the horizon.\r\n\r\nIf we elevate the globe still higher, the circle of _perpetual\r\nApparition_ will be nearer the equator, as will that of _perpetual\r\nOccultation_ on the other side. For example, Let us rectify the globe\r\nfor the latitude of 80 degrees North: when the Sun’s declination is 10\r\ndegrees North; he begins to turn above the horizon without setting;\r\nand all the while he is making his progress from this point to the\r\ntropic of ♋, and back again, he never sets. After the same manner, when\r\nhis declination is 10 degrees South, he is just seen at noon in the\r\nhorizon; and all the while he is going Southward, and back again, he\r\ndisappears, being hid just so long as before, at the opposite time of\r\nthe year he appeared visible.\r\n\r\nLet us now bring the North Pole into the Zenith, then will the\r\nequinoctial coincide with the horizon; and consequently all the\r\nNorthern parallels are above the horizon, and all the Southern ones\r\nbelow it. Here is but one day and one night throughout the year, it\r\nbeing day all the while the Sun is to the Northward of the equinoctial,\r\nand night for the other half year. All the Stars that have North\r\ndeclination, always appear above the horizon, and at the same height;\r\nand all those that are on the other side, are never seen.\r\n\r\nWhat has been here said of rectifying the globe to North latitude,\r\nholds for the same latitude South; only that before the longest days\r\nwere, when the Sun was in ♋, the same happening now when the Sun is\r\nin ♑; and so of the rest of the parallels, the seasons being directly\r\nopposite to those who live in different hemispheres.\r\n\r\nI shall again explain some things delivered above in general terms, by\r\nparticular problems.\r\n\r\nBut from what has been already said, we may first make the following\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n1. _All places of the Earth do equally enjoy the benefit of the Sun, in\r\nrespect of time, and are equally deprived of it, the Days at one time\r\nof the Year, being exactly equal to the Nights at the opposite season._\r\n\r\n2. _In all places of the Earth, save exactly under the Poles, the Days\r\nand Nights are of equal length_ (viz. _12 hours each) when the Sun is\r\nin the equinoctial._\r\n\r\n3. _Those who live under the equinoctial, have the days and nights of\r\nequal lengths at all times of the year._\r\n\r\n4. _In all places between the equinoctial and the Poles, the days and\r\nnights are never equal, but when the Sun is in the equinoctial points_\r\n♈ _and_ ♎.\r\n\r\n5. _The nearer any place is to the equator, the less is the difference\r\nbetween the length of the artificial days and nights in the said place;\r\nand the more remote the greater._\r\n\r\n6. _To all the inhabitants lying under the same parallel of latitudes\r\nthe days and nights are of equal lengths, and that at all times of the\r\nyear._\r\n\r\n7. _The Sun is vertical twice a year to all places between the tropics;\r\nto those under the tropics, once a year; but never any where else._\r\n\r\n8. _In all places between the Polar Circles, and the Poles, the Sun\r\nappears some number of days without setting; and at the opposite time\r\nof the year he is for the same length of time without rising; and the\r\nnearer unto, or further remote from the Pole, those places are, the\r\nlonger or shorter is the Sun’s continued presence or absence from the\r\nPole._\r\n\r\n9. _In all places lying exactly under the Polar Circles, the Sun, when\r\nhe is in the nearest tropic, appears 24 hours without setting; and\r\nwhen he is in the contrary tropic, he is for the same length of time,\r\nwithout rising; but at all other times of the year, he rises and sets\r\nthere, as in other places._\r\n\r\n10. _In all places lying in the (Northern/Southern) hemisphere,\r\nthe longest day and shortest night, is when the Sun is in the\r\n(Northern/Southern) tropic, and on the contrary._\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XVIII. _The Latitude of any place, not\r\n        exceeding 66½ degrees, and the day of the Month\r\n        being given; to find the time of Sun-rising and\r\n        setting, and the length of the Day and Night._\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the globe according to the latitude, bring the Sun’s\r\nplace to the meridian, and put the hour index to 12 at noon; then bring\r\nthe Sun’s place the Eastern part of the horizon, and the index will\r\nshew the time when the Sun rises. Again, turn the globe until the Sun’s\r\nplace be brought to the Western side of the horizon, and the index will\r\nshew the time of Sun-setting.\r\n\r\nThe hour of Sun-setting doubled, gives the length of the day; and the\r\nhour of Sun-rising doubled, gives the length of the night.\r\n\r\nLet it be required to find when the Sun rises and sets at _London_ on\r\nthe 20th of _April_. Rectify the globe for the latitude of _London_,\r\nand having found the Sun’s place corresponding to _May_ the 1st, _viz._\r\n♉ 10¾ degrees, bring ♉ to 10¾ degrees to the meridian, and set the\r\nindex to 12 at noon; then turn the globe about ’till ♉ 10¾ degrees be\r\nbrought to the Eastern part of the horizon, and you’ll find the index\r\npoint 4¾ hours, this being doubled, gives the length of the night 9½\r\nhours. Again, bring the Sun’s place to the Western part of the horizon,\r\nand the index will point 7¼ hours, which is the time of Sun-setting;\r\nthis being doubled, gives the length of the day 14½ hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XIX. _To find the length of the longest\r\n        and shortest Day and Night in any given place, not\r\n        exceeding 66½ degrees of Latitude._\r\n\r\n_Note_, The longest day at all places on the (North/South)\r\nside of the equator, is when the Sun is in the first point of\r\n(_Cancer_/_Capricorn_) Wherefore having rectified the globe for the\r\nlatitude, find the time of Sun-rising and setting, and thence the\r\nlength of the day and night, as in the last problem, according to the\r\nplace of the Sun: Or, having rectified the globe for the latitude,\r\nbring the solstitial point of that hemisphere, to the East part of\r\nthe horizon, and set the index to 12 at noon; then turning the globe\r\nabout ’till the said solstitial point touches the Western side of the\r\nhorizon, the number of hours from noon to the place where the index\r\npoints (being counted according to the motion of the index) is the\r\nlength of the longest day; the complement whereof to 24 hours, is the\r\nlength of the shortest night, and the reverse gives the shortest day\r\nand the longest night.\r\n\r\n              _Longest Day._       _Shor.

And by\r\nthe reverse, having the _Climate_, you have thereby the length of the\r\nlongest day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XX. _To find in what Latitude the\r\n        longest Day is, of any given length, less than 24\r\n        hours._\r\n\r\nBring the solstitial point to the meridian, and set the index to 12 at\r\nnoon; then turn the globe Westward, ’till the index points at half the\r\nnumber of hours given; which being done, keep the globe from turning\r\nround its axis, and slide the meridian up or down in the notches, ’till\r\nthe solstitial point comes to the horizon, then that elevation of the\r\nPole will be the latitude.\r\n\r\nIf the hours given be 16, the latitude is 49 degrees; if 20 hours, the\r\nlatitude is 63¼ degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXI. _A place being given in one of the_\r\n        Frigid Zones (_suppose the_ Northern) _to find\r\n        what number of Days (of 24 hours each) the Sun\r\n        doth constantly shine upon the same, how long he\r\n        is absent, and also the first and last Day of his\r\n        appearance._\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the globe according to the latitude, turn it about\r\nuntil some point in the first quadrant of the ecliptic (because the\r\nlatitude is North) intersects the meridian in the North point of the\r\nhorizon; and right against that point of the ecliptic on the horizon,\r\nstands the day of the month when the longest day begins.\r\n\r\nAnd if the globe be turned about ’till some point in the second\r\nquadrant of the ecliptic cuts the meridian in the same point of the\r\nhorizon, it will shew the Sun’s place when the longest day ends,\r\nwhence the day of the month may be found, as before: Then the number\r\nof natural days contained between the times the longest day begins and\r\nends is the length of the longest day required.\r\n\r\nAgain, turn the globe about, until some point in the third quadrant of\r\nthe ecliptic cuts the meridian in the South part of the horizon; that\r\npoint of the ecliptic will give the time when the longest night begins.\r\nLastly, turn the globe about, until some point in the fourth quadrant\r\nof the ecliptic cuts the meridian in the South point of the horizon;\r\nand that point of the ecliptic will be the place of the Sun when the\r\nlongest night ends.\r\n\r\nOr, the time when the longest day or night begins, being known, their\r\nend may be found by counting the number of days from that time to the\r\nsucceeding solstice; then counting the same number of days from the\r\nsolstitial day, will give the time when it ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXII. _To find in what Latitude the\r\n        longest Day is, of any given length less than_ 182\r\n        _Natural Days._\r\n\r\nFind a point in the ecliptic half so many degrees distant from the\r\nsolstitial point, as there are days given, and bring that point to the\r\nmeridian; then keep the globe from turning round its axis, and move the\r\nmeridian up or down until the aforesaid point of the ecliptic comes to\r\nthe horizon; that elevation of the Pole will be the latitude required.\r\n\r\nIf the days given were 78, the latitude is 71½ degrees.\r\n\r\nThis method is not accurate, because the degrees in the ecliptic do not\r\ncorrespond to natural days; and also because the Sun does not always\r\nmove in the ecliptic at the same rate; however, such problems as these\r\nmay serve for amusements.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXIII. _The day of the Month being\r\n        given, to find when the Morning and Evening_\r\n        Twilight _begins and ends, in any place upon the\r\n        Globe._\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing problem, by the length of the day, we mean the time\r\nfrom Sun-rising to Sun-set; and the night we reckoned from Sun-set,\r\n’till he rose next morning. But it is found by experience, that _Total\r\nDarkness_ does not commence in the evening, ’till the Sun has got 18\r\ndegrees below the horizon; and when he comes within the same distance\r\nof the horizon next morning, we have the first _Dawn of Day_. This\r\nfaint light which we have in the morning and evening, before and after\r\nthe Sun’s rising and setting, is what we call the _Twilight_. [4]\r\nHaving rectified the globe for the latitude, the zenith, and the Sun’s\r\nplace, turn the globe and the quadrant of altitude until the Sun’s\r\nplace cuts 18 degrees below the horizon (if the quadrant reaches so\r\nfar) then the index upon the hour circle will shew the beginning or\r\nending of twilight after the same manner as before we found the time\r\nof the Sun-rising and setting, in _Prob. 18_. But by reason of the\r\nthickness of the wooden horizon, we can’t conveniently see, or compute\r\nwhen the Sun’s place is brought to the point aforesaid. Wherefore the\r\nglobe being rectified as above directed, turn the globe, and also the\r\nquadrant of altitude, Westward, until that point in the ecliptic, which\r\nis opposite to the Sun’s place, cuts the quadrant in the 18th degree\r\nabove the horizon; then the hour index will shew the time when day\r\nbreaks in the morning. And if you turn the globe and the quadrant of\r\naltitude, until the point opposite to the Sun’s place cuts the quadrant\r\nin the Eastern hemisphere, the hour hand will shew when twilight ends\r\nin the evening. Or, having found the time from midnight when the\r\nmorning twilight begins, if you reckon so many hours before midnight,\r\nit will give the time when the evening twilight ends. Having found the\r\ntime when twilight begins in the morning, find the time of Sun-rising,\r\nby _Prob. 18_, and the difference will be the duration of twilight.\r\n\r\nThus at _London_ on the 12th of _May_ twilight begins at three quarters\r\npast one o’clock: The Sun rises at about half an hour past four: Whence\r\nthe duration of twilight now is 2¾ hours, both in the morning and\r\nevening. On the 12th of _November_, the twilight begins at half an hour\r\npast six, being somewhat above an hour before Sun-rising.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXIV. _To find the time when total\r\n        Darkness ceases, or when the Twilight continues\r\n        from Sun-setting to Sun-setting, in any given\r\n        place._\r\n\r\nLet the place be in the Northern hemisphere; then if the complement of\r\nthe latitude be greater than (the depression) 18 degrees, subtract 18\r\ndegrees from it, and the remainder will be the Sun’s declination North,\r\nwhen total darkness ceases. But if the complement of the latitude is\r\nless than 18 degrees, their difference will be the Sun’s declination\r\nSouth, when the twilight begins to continue all night. If the latitude\r\nis South, the only difference will be, that the Sun’s declination will\r\nbe on the contrary side.\r\n\r\nThus at _London_, when the Sun’s declination North is greater than\r\n20½ degrees, there is no total darkness, but constant twilight, which\r\nhappens from the 26th of _May_ to the 18th of _July_, being near two\r\nmonths. Under the North Pole the twilight ceases, when the Sun’s\r\ndeclination is greater than 18 degrees South, which is from the 13th\r\nof _November_, ’till the 29th of _January_: So that notwithstanding\r\nthe Sun is absent in this part of the world for half a year together,\r\nyet total darkness does not continue above 11 weeks; and besides,\r\nthe _Moon_ is above the horizon for a whole fortnight of every month\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXV. _The day of the Month be given; to\r\n        find those places of the Frigid Zones, where the\r\n        Sun begins to shine continually without setting;\r\n        and also those places where he begins to be totally\r\n        absent._\r\n\r\nBring the Sun’s place to the meridian, and mark the number of degrees\r\ncontained betwixt that point and the equator; then count the same\r\nnumber of degrees from the nearest Pole (_viz._ the North Pole, if the\r\nSun’s declination is Northerly, otherwise the South Pole) towards the\r\nequator, and note that point upon the meridian; then turn the globe\r\nabout, and all the places which pass under the said point, are those\r\nwhere the Sun begins to shine constantly, without setting on the given\r\nday. If you lay the same distance from the opposite Pole towards the\r\nequator, and turn the globe about, all the places which pass under that\r\npoint, will be those where the longest night begins.\r\n\r\n    _The Latitude of the place being given, to find the\r\n        hour of the day when the Sun shines._\r\n\r\n_If it be in the summer_, elevate the Pole according to the latitude,\r\nand set the meridian due North and South; then the shadow of the axis\r\nwill cut the hour on the Dial plate: For the globe being rectified in\r\nthis manner, the hour circle is a true _Equinoctial Dial_; the axis of\r\nthe globe being the _Gnomon_. This holds true in _Theory_, but it might\r\nnot be very accurate in practice, because of the difficulty in placing\r\nthe horizon of the globe truly horizontal, and its meridian due North\r\nand South.\r\n\r\nIf it be in the winter half year, elevate the South Pole according\r\nto the latitude North, and let the North part of the horizon be in\r\nthe South part of the meridian; then the shade of the axis will show\r\nthe hour of the day as before: But this cannot be so conveniently\r\nperformed, tho’ the reason is the same as in the former case.\r\n\r\n_To find the Sun’s altitude, when it shines, by the Globe._\r\n\r\nHaving set the frame of the globe truly horizontal or level, turn the\r\nNorth Pole towards the Sun, and move the meridian up or down in the\r\nnotches, until the axis casts no shadow; then the arch of the meridian,\r\ncontained betwixt the Pole and the horizon, is the Sun’s altitude.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The best way to find the Sun’s altitude, is by a little\r\nquadrant graduated into degrees, and having sights and a plummet to it:\r\nThus, hold the quadrant in your hand, so as the rays of the Sun may\r\npass through both the sights, the plummet then hanging freely by the\r\nside of the instrument, will cut in the limb the altitude required.\r\nThese quadrants are to be had at the instrument-makers, with lines\r\ndrawn upon them, for finding the hour of the day, and the azimuth; with\r\nseveral other pretty conclusions, very entertaining for beginners.\r\n\r\n    _The Latitude and the Day of the Month being given, to\r\n        find the hour of the day when the Sun shines._\r\n\r\nHaving placed the wooden frame upon a level, and the meridian due\r\nNorth and South, rectify the globe for the latitude, and fix a needle\r\nperpendicularly over the Sun’s place: The Sun’s place being brought to\r\nthe meridian, set the hour index at 12 at noon, then turn the globe\r\nabout until the needle points exactly to the Sun, and casts no shadow,\r\nand then the index will shew the hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXVI. _The Latitude, the Sun’s Place,\r\n        and his Altitude, being given; to find the hour of\r\n        the Day, and the Sun’s Azimuth from the Meridian._\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the globe for the latitude, the zenith, and the Sun’s\r\nplace, turn the globe and the quadrant of altitude, so that the Sun’s\r\nplace may cut the given degree of altitude: then the index will show\r\nthe hour, and the quadrant will cut the azimuth in the horizon. Thus,\r\nif at _London_, on the 21st of _August_, the Suns altitude, be 36\r\ndegrees in the forenoon, the hour of the day will be IX, and the Sun’s\r\nazimuth about 58 degrees from the South part of the meridian.\r\n\r\n    _The Sun’s Azimuth being given, to place the Meridian\r\n        of the Globe due North and South, or to find a\r\n        Meridian Line when the Sun shines._\r\n\r\nLet the Sun’s azimuth be 30 degrees South-Easterly, set the horizon of\r\nthe globe upon a level, and bring the North Pole into the zenith; then\r\nturn the horizon about until the shade of the axis cuts as many hours\r\nas is equivalent to the azimuth (allowing 15 degrees to an hour) in\r\nthe North-West part of the hour circle, _viz._ X at night, which being\r\ndone, the meridian of the globe stands in the true meridian of the\r\nplace. The globe standing in this position, if you hang two plummets\r\nat the North and South points of the wooden horizon, and draw a line\r\nbetwixt them, you will have a meridian line; which if it be on a fixed\r\nplane (as a floor or window) it will be a guide for placing the globe\r\ndue North and South, at any other time.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXVII. _The Latitude, Hour of the Day,\r\n        and the Sun’s place being given, to find the Sun’s\r\n        Altitude and Azimuth._\r\n\r\nRectify the globe for the latitude, the zenith, and the Sun’s place,\r\nthen the number of degrees contained betwixt the Sun’s place and\r\nthe vertex, is the Sun’s meridional zenith distance; the complement\r\nof which to 90 degrees, is the Sun’s meridian altitude. If you turn\r\nthe globe about until the index points to any other given hour, then\r\nbringing the quadrant of altitude to cut the Sun’s place, you will\r\nhave the Sun’s altitude at that hour; and where the quadrant cuts the\r\nhorizon, is the Sun’s azimuth at the same time. Thus _May_ the 1st at\r\n_London_, the Sun’s meridian altitude will be 61½ degrees; and at 10\r\no’clock in the morning, the Sun’s altitude will be 52 degrees, and his\r\nazimuth about 50 degrees from the South part of the meridian.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXVIII. _The Latitude of the place,\r\n        and the day of the Month being given; to find the\r\n        depression of the Sun below the Horizon, and the\r\n        Azimuth at any Hour of the Night._\r\n\r\nHaving rectified the globe for the latitude, the zenith, and the Sun’s\r\nplace, take a point in the ecliptic exactly opposite to the Sun’s\r\nplace, and find the Sun’s altitude and azimuth, as by the last problem,\r\nand these will be the depression and the altitude required. Thus,\r\nif the time given be the 1st of _December_, at 10 o’clock at night,\r\nthe depression and azimuth will be the same as was found in the last\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXIX. _The Latitude, the Sun’s Place,\r\n        and his Azimuth being given, to find his Altitude,\r\n        and the Hour._\r\n\r\nRectify the globe for the latitude, the zenith, and the Sun’s place,\r\nthen put the quadrant of altitude to the Sun’s azimuth in the horizon,\r\nand turn the globe ’till the Sun’s place meet the edge of the quadrant,\r\nthen the said edge will shew the altitude, and the index point to\r\nthe hour. Thus, _May_ the 21st at _London_ when the Sun is due East,\r\nhis altitude will be about 24 degrees, and the hour about VII in\r\nthe morning; and when his azimuth is 60 degrees South-Westerly, the\r\naltitude will be about 44½ degrees, and the hour about 2¾ in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThus, the latitude and the day being known, and having besides either\r\nthe altitude, the azimuth, or the hour; the other two may be easily\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXX. _The Latitude, the Sun’s Altitude,\r\n        and his Azimuth being given; to find his Place in\r\n        the Ecliptic and the Hour._\r\n\r\nRectify the globe for the latitude and zenith, and set the edge of the\r\nquadrant to the given azimuth; then turning the globe about, that point\r\nof the ecliptic which cuts the altitude, will be the Sun’s place. Keep\r\nthe quadrant of the altitude in the same position, and having brought\r\nthe Sun’s place to the meridian, and the hour index to 12 at noon, turn\r\nthe globe about ’till the Sun’s place cuts the quadrant of altitude,\r\nand then the index will point the hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXXI. _The Declination and Meridian\r\n        Altitude of the Sun, or of any Star being given; to\r\n        find the Latitude of the Place._\r\n\r\nMark the point of declination upon the meridian, according as it is\r\neither North or South from the equator; then slide the meridian up or\r\ndown in the notches, ’till the point of declination be so far distant\r\nfrom the horizon, as is the given meridian altitude; that elevation of\r\nthe Pole will be the latitude.\r\n\r\nThus, if the Sun’s, or any Star’s meridian altitude be 50 degrees, and\r\nits declination 11½ degrees North, the latitude will be 51½ degrees\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXXII. _The Day and Hour of a Lunar\r\n        Eclipse being known; to find all those Places upon\r\n        the Globe where the same will be visible._\r\n[5] Find where the Sun is vertical at the given hour, and bring that\r\npoint to the zenith; then the Eclipse will be visible in all those\r\nplaces that are under the horizon; Or, if you bring the Antipodes to\r\nthe place where the Sun is vertical, into the zenith, you will have the\r\nplaces where the Eclipse will be visible above the horizon.\r\n\r\n_Note_, Because _Lunar_ eclipses continue sometimes for a long while\r\ntogether, they may be seen in more places than one hemisphere of the\r\nEarth; for by the Earth’s motion round its axis, during the time of the\r\neclipse, the Moon will rise in several places after the eclipse began.\r\n\r\n_Note_, When an eclipse of the Sun is central, if you bring the place\r\nwhere the Sun is vertical at that time, into the zenith, some part of\r\nthe eclipse will be visible in most places within the upper hemisphere;\r\nbut by reason of the short duration of Solar eclipses, and the latitude\r\nwhich the Moon commonly has at that time (tho’ but small) there is\r\nno certainty in determining the places where those eclipses will be\r\nvisible by the globe; but recourse must be had to calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXXIII. _The Day of the Month, and Hour\r\n        of the Day, according to our way of reckoning\r\n        in_ England, _being given; to find thereby the_\r\n        Babylonic, Italic, _and the_ Jewish, _or Judaical\r\n        Hour._\r\n\r\n1. To find the _Babylonic Hour_ (which is the number of hours from\r\nSun-rising.) Having found the time of Sun-rising in the given place,\r\nthe difference betwixt this and the hour given, is the _Babylonic Hour_.\r\n\r\n2. To find the _Italic Hour_ (which is the number of hours from\r\nSun-setting.) Subtract the hour of Sun-setting from the given hour, and\r\nthe remainder will be the _Italic Hour_ required.\r\n\r\n3. To find the _Jewish Hour_ (which is ¹/₁₂ part of an _Artificial\r\nDay_.) Find how many hours the day consists of; then say, as the number\r\nof hours the day consists of is to 12 hours, so is the hour since\r\nSun-rising to the _Judaical_ hour required.\r\n\r\nThus, if the Sun rises at 4 o’clock (consequently sets at 8) and the\r\nhour given be 5 in the evening, the _Babylonish_ hour will be the 13th,\r\nthe _Italic_ the 21st and the _Jewish_ hour will be nine and three\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe converse being given, the hour of the day, according to our way of\r\nreckoning in _England_, may be easily found.\r\n\r\nThe following Problems are peculiar to the _Celestial Globe_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XXXIV. _To find the Right Ascension and\r\n        Declination of the Sun, or any Fixed Star._\r\n\r\nBring the Sun’s place in the ecliptic to the meridian; then that degree\r\nof the equator, which is cut by the meridian, will be the _Sun’s Right\r\nAscension_; and that degree of the meridian, which is exactly over the\r\nSun’s place, is the _Sun’s Declination_.\r\n\r\nAfter the same manner, bring the place of any Fixed Star to the\r\nmeridian, and you will find its Right Ascension in the equinoctial, and\r\nDeclination of the meridian.\r\n\r\nThus, the right ascension and declination is found, after the same\r\nmanner as the longitude and latitude of a place upon the _Terrestrial\r\nGlobe_.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The right ascension and declination of the Sun vary every\r\nday; but the right ascension, _&c._ of the Fixed Stars is the same\r\nthroughout the year[6].\r\n\r\n    The Sun’s Right         Ascension.

By the converse of this\r\nmethod, having the latitude and longitude of a Star given, it will be\r\neasy to find the Star upon the globe.\r\n\r\nThe distance betwixt two Stars, or the number of degrees contained\r\nbetwixt them, may be found by laying the quadrant of altitude over each\r\nof them, and counting the number of degrees intercepted; after the same\r\nmanner as we found the distance betwixt two places on the _Terrestrial_\r\nGlobe, in _Prob._ VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB.

And\r\nif the quadrant of altitude be laid over the center of any particular\r\nStar, it will show that Star’s altitude at that time; and where it cuts\r\nthe horizon, will be the Star’s azimuth from the North or South part of\r\nthe meridian.\r\n\r\nThe globe being kept in the same elevation, and from turning round its\r\naxis, move the wooden frame about until the North and South points of\r\nthe horizon lie exactly in the meridian; then right lines imagined to\r\npass from the center thro’ each Star upon the surface of the globe,\r\nwill point out the real Star in the heavens, which those on the globe\r\nare made to represent. And if you are by the side of some wall whose\r\nbearing you know, lay the quadrant of altitude to that bearing in the\r\nhorizon, and it will cut all those Stars which at that very time are\r\nto be seen in the same direction, or close by the side of the said\r\nwall. Thus knowing some of the remarkable Stars in any part of the\r\nheavens, the neighbouring Stars may be distinguished by observing their\r\nsituations with respect to those that are already known, and comparing\r\nthem with the Stars drawn upon the globe.\r\n\r\nThus, if you turn your face towards the North, you will find the North\r\nPole of the globe points to the _Pole-Star_; then you may observe two\r\nStars somewhat less bright than the Pole-Star, almost in a right line\r\nwith it, and four more which form a sort of _quadrangle_; these seven\r\nStars make the constellation called the _Little Bear_; the Pole Star\r\nbeing in the tip of the tail. In this neighbourhood you will observe\r\nseven bright Stars, which are commonly called _Charles’s Wane_;\r\nthese are the bright Stars in the _Great Bear_, and form much such\r\nanother figure with those before-mentioned in the _little Bear_: The\r\ntwo foremost of the square lie almost in a right line with the Pole\r\nStar, and are called the _Pointers_, so that knowing the Pointers,\r\nyou may easily find the Pole-Star. Thus the rest of the Stars in this\r\nconstellation, and all the Stars in the neighbouring constellations\r\nmay be easily found, by observing how the unknown Stars lie either in\r\n_quadrangles_, _triangles_, or strait lines from those that are already\r\nknown upon the globe.\r\n\r\nAfter the same manner the globe being rectified, you may distinguish\r\nthose Stars that are to the Southward of you, and be soon acquainted\r\nwith all the Stars that are visible in our hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_SCHOLIUM._\r\n\r\nThe globe being rectified to the latitude of any place, if you turn it\r\nround its axis, all those Stars that do not go below the horizon during\r\na whole revolution of the globe, never set in that place; and those\r\nthat do not come above the horizon never rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB.

If the place be in South latitude, then the contrary is to be\r\nobserved with respect to the declination.\r\n\r\nThe semi-(diurnal/nocturnal) arch being doubled, gives the time of\r\ncontinuance (above/below) the horizon. Or the time of continuance above\r\nthe horizon, may be found by counting the number of hours contained in\r\nthe upper part of the horary circle, betwixt the place where the index\r\npointed when the given point was in the Eastern or Western parts of\r\nthe horizon. If the given point was the Sun’s place, the index pointed\r\nthe time of his rising and setting, when the said place was in the\r\nEastern and Western parts of the horizon, as in _Prob. 18_. Or the time\r\nof Sun-rising may be found by adding or subtracting his ascensional\r\ndifference, to or from the hour of six, according as the latitude and\r\ndeclination are either contrary or the same way.\r\n\r\nThus, at _London_, on the 31st of _May_, the _Sun’s_\r\n\r\n    _Amplitude_ is 24 degrees Northerly.\r\n    _Oblique Ascension_, 20.\r\n    _Oblique Descension_, 58.\r\n    _Ascensional Difference_, 19.\r\n    _Semi-diurnal Arch_, 109.\r\n    His continuance above the horizon, 14½ hours.\r\n    Sun rises at three quarters past four.\r\n    Sun sets a quarter past seven.\r\n\r\nThese things for the Sun vary every day; but for a Fixed Star the day\r\nof the month need not be given, for they are the same all the year\r\nround.\r\n\r\n    In the latitude of 51½ North, _Syrus_’s\r\n    _Amplitude_ is about 28 degrees Southerly.\r\n    _Oblique Ascension_, 121.\r\n    _Oblique Descension_, 75.\r\n    _Ascensional Difference_, 23.\r\n    _Semi-diurnal Arch_, 67.\r\n    Continuance above the horizon, 9 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB.

Thus, bring the\r\ngiven Star to the meridian, and set the index to the given hour; then\r\nturn the globe ’till the index points to 12 at noon, and the meridian\r\nwill cut the Sun’s place in the ecliptic.

If the two Stars are of the same altitude, move the globe so that\r\nthe same degree on the quadrant will cut both Stars, then the index\r\nwill shew the hour.\r\n\r\nThis problem is useful when the quantity of the azimuth of the two\r\nStars in the first case, or of their altitude in the latter case, is\r\nnot known.\r\n\r\n    _If two Stars were given, one on the meridian, and the\r\n        other in the East or West part of the horizon; to\r\n        find the Latitude._\r\n\r\nBring that Star which was observed on the meridian, to the meridian of\r\nthe globe, and keep the globe from turning round its axis; then slide\r\nthe meridian up or down in the notches, ’till the other Star is brought\r\nto the East or West part of the horizon, and that elevation of the Pole\r\nwill be the _Latitude_ sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB.

To find the _Heliacal setting_, bring the Star to the West\r\nside of the horizon, and turn the quadrant about to the Eastern side,\r\n’till the 12th degree of it above the horizon, cuts the ecliptic; then\r\nthat degree of the ecliptic which is opposite to this point, is the\r\nSun’s place when the Star _sets Heliacally_.\r\n\r\nThus you will find that _Arcturus_ rises Heliacally the 28th of\r\n_September_, and sets Heliacally _December_ the 2d.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XLV. _To find the place of any Planet\r\n        upon the globe; and so by that means, to find its\r\n        place in the Heavens: Also to find at what Hour any\r\n        Planet will rise or set, or be on the meridian at\r\n        any one Day in the Year._\r\n\r\nYou must first seek in an Ephemeris (_White_’s Ephemeris will do\r\nwell enough) for the place of the Planet proposed on that day; then\r\nmark that point of the ecliptic, either with chalk, or by sticking\r\non a little black patch; and then for that night you may perform any\r\nproblem, as before, by a Fixed Star.\r\n\r\nLet it be required to find the situation of _Jupiter_ among the Fixed\r\nStars in the heavens, and also what time he rises and sets, and comes\r\nto the meridian on the 19th of _May_, 1757, N. S. at _London_.\r\n\r\nLooking for the 19th of _May_, 1757, in _White_’s Ephemeris, I find\r\nthat _Jupiter_’s place at that time is in about 12 degrees of ♏;\r\nlatitude about 1¼ degree North. Then looking for that point upon the\r\nCelestial globe, I find that ♃ is then nearly in conjunction with the\r\nbright Star in the Southern Balance, and about 1 degree North of it.\r\n\r\nTo find when he rises and sets, and comes to the meridian: Having put\r\na little black patch on the place of _Jupiter_, elevate the globe\r\naccording to the latitude, and having brought the Sun’s place to\r\nthe meridian, set the hour index to 12 at noon; then turn the mark\r\nwhich was made for _Jupiter_, to the Eastern part of the horizon,\r\nI find ♃ will rise somewhat more than half an hour after three in\r\nthe afternoon; and turning the globe about, I find it comes to the\r\nmeridian a little before eleven at night; and sets almost a quarter\r\npast six next morning.\r\n\r\nThis example being understood, it will be easy to find when either of\r\nthe other two superior Planets, _viz. Mars_ and _Saturn_, rise, set,\r\nand come to the meridian.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this subject about the Globes with the following\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROB. XLVI. _To find all that space upon the\r\n        Earth, where an Eclipse of one of the Satellites\r\n        of_ Jupiter _will be visible._\r\n\r\nHaving found that place upon the Earth, in which the Sun is vertical at\r\nthe time of the eclipse, by _Prob. 13_, elevate the globe according to\r\nthe latitude of the said place; then bring the place to the meridian,\r\nand set the hour index to 12 at noon. If _Jupiter_ be in consequence of\r\nthe Sun, draw a line with black lead, or the like, along the Eastern\r\nside of the horizon, which line, will pass over all those places where\r\nthe Sun is setting at that time; then count the difference betwixt the\r\nright ascension of the Sun, and that of _Jupiter_, and turn the globe\r\nWestward, ’till the hour index points to this difference; then keep the\r\nglobe from turning round its axis, and elevate the meridian, according\r\nto the declination of _Jupiter_. The globe being in this position, draw\r\na line along the Eastern side of the horizon; then the space between\r\nthis line, and the line before drawn, will comprehend all those places\r\nof the Earth where _Jupiter_ will be visible, from the setting of the\r\nSun, to the setting of _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\nBut if _Jupiter_ be in antecedence of the Sun (_i. e._ rises before\r\nhim) having brought the place where the Sun is vertical, to the zenith,\r\nand put the hour index to 12 at noon, draw a line on the Western side\r\nof the horizon; then elevate the globe according to the declination of\r\n_Jupiter_, and turn it about Eastward, until the index points to so\r\nmany hours distant from noon, as is the difference of right ascension\r\nof the Sun and _Jupiter_. The globe being in this position, draw a line\r\nalong the Western side of the horizon; then the space contained between\r\nthis line, and the other last drawn, will comprehend all those places\r\nupon the Earth where the Eclipse is visible, between the rising of the\r\nSun, and that of _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The_ DESCRIPTION _of the Great_ ORRERY,\r\n        _lately made by Mr._ THOMAS WRIGHT,\r\n        Mathematical Instrument-Maker to his late\r\n        MAJESTY, and now by BENJAMIN\r\n        COLE, _his Successor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ORRERY is an Astronomical Machine, made to represent the motions of\r\nthe Planets. These machines are made of various sizes, some having more\r\nPlanets than others; but I shall here confine myself to the description\r\nof that above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction we gave a short account of the _Order_, _Periods_,\r\n_Distances_, and _Magnitudes_ of the _Primary Planets_; and of the\r\n_Distances_ and _Periodical Resolutions_ of the _Secondary Planets_\r\nround their respective Primaries. We shall here explain their\r\n_Stations_, _Regradations_, _Eclipses_, _Phases_, _&c._ but first let\r\nus take a general view of the _Orrery_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Description of the _Orrery_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vide _Frontispiece_.]\r\n\r\nThe frame which contains the wheel-work, _&c._ that regulates the whole\r\n_Machine_, is made of fine ebony, and is near four feet in diameter;\r\nthe outside thereof is adorned with twelve pilasters, curiously wrought\r\nand gilt: Between these pilasters the twelve Signs of the _Zodiac_ are\r\nneatly painted, with gilded frames. Above the frame is a broad ring,\r\nsupported with twelve pillars: This ring represents the _Plane_ of the\r\n_Ecliptic_, upon which there are two scales of degrees, and between\r\nthose the names and characters of the twelve Signs. Near the outside is\r\na scale of months and days, exactly corresponding to the Sun’s place at\r\nnoon, each day throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAbove the ecliptic stands some of the principal circles of the sphere,\r\naccording to their respective situations in the heavens, _viz._ N°\r\n10, are the two _Colures_, divided into degrees, and half degrees;\r\nN° 11, is one half of the Equinoctial Circle, making an angle with\r\nthe ecliptic of 23½ degrees. The _Tropic of Cancer_, and the _Arctic\r\nCircle_, are each fixed parallel, and at their proper distance from\r\nthe equinoctial. On the Northern half of the ecliptic is a brass\r\nsemicircle, moveable upon two points fixed in ♈ and ♎: This semicircle\r\nserves as a moveable horizon, to be put to any degree of latitude upon\r\nthe North part of the meridian. The whole machine is also so contrived,\r\nas to be set to any latitude, without in the least affecting any of\r\nthe inside motions: For this purpose there are two strong hinges (N°\r\n13,) fixed to the bottom frame, upon which the instrument moves, and a\r\nstrong brass arch, having holes at every degree, thro’ which a strong\r\npin is to be put, according to the elevation. This arch and the two\r\nhinges, support the whole machine, when it is lifted up according to\r\nany latitude; and the arch at other times lies conveniently under the\r\nbottom frame.\r\n\r\nWhen the machine is set to any latitude (which is easily done by two\r\nmen, each taking hold of two handles, conveniently fixed for that\r\npurpose) set the moveable horizon to the same degree upon the meridian,\r\nand you may form an idea of the respective altitude, or depressions of\r\nthe Planets, above or below the horizon, according to their respective\r\npositions, with regard to the meridian.\r\n\r\nWithin the ecliptic, and nearly in the same place thereof, stands the\r\nSun, and all the Planets, both Primary and Secondary. The Sun (Nº\r\n1.) stands in the middle of the whole system, upon a wire, making an\r\nangle with the plane of the ecliptic, of about 82 degrees; which is\r\nthe inclination of the Sun’s axis, to the axis of the ecliptic. Next\r\nto the Sun is a Small ball (Nº 2.) representing _Mercury_: Next to\r\n_Mercury_ is _Venus_ (Nº 3.) represented by a larger ball (and both\r\nthese stand upon wires,) so that the balls themselves may be more\r\nvisibly perceived by the eye. The Earth is represented (Nº 4.) by an\r\nivory ball, having some of the principal meridians and parallels, and a\r\nlittle sketch of a map described upon it. The wire which supports the\r\nEarth, makes an angle with the plane of the ecliptic 66½ degrees, which\r\nis the inclination of the Earth’s axis to that of the ecliptic. Near\r\nthe bottom of the Earth’s axis is a Dial Plate (Nº 9.) having an index\r\npointing to the hours of the day, as the Earth turns round its axis.\r\n\r\nRound the Earth is a ring, supported by two small pillars, which ring\r\nrepresents the Orbit of the Moon, and the division upon it answers to\r\nthe Moon’s latitude; the motion of this ring represents the motion of\r\nthe Moon’s Orbit, according to that of the Nodes. Within this ring\r\nis the Moon (Nº 5.) having a black cap or case, which by its motion,\r\nrepresents the _Phases_ of the Moon according to her age. Without the\r\nOrbits of the Earth and Moon is _Mars_ (Nº 6.) The next in order to\r\n_Mars_ is _Jupiter_, and his four Moons (Nº 7); each of these moons is\r\nsupported by a crooked wire fixed in a socket, which turns about the\r\npillar that supports _Jupiter_. These satellites may be turned by the\r\nhand to any position; and yet when the machine is put in motion, they\r\nwill all move in their proper times. The outermost of all is _Saturn_,\r\nand his five Moons (Nº 8.) These moons are supported and contrived\r\nafter the same manner with those of _Jupiter_. The whole machine is put\r\ninto motion by turning a small winch (like the key of a clock, Nº 14.)\r\nand all the inside work is so truly wrought, that it requires but very\r\nsmall strength to put the whole motion.\r\n\r\nAbove the handle there is a cylindrical pin, which may be drawn a\r\nlittle out, or pushed in, at pleasure: when it is pushed in, all the\r\nPlanets, both primary and Secondary, will move according to their\r\nrespective periods, by turning the handle: When it is drawn out, the\r\nmotions of the Satellites of _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_ will be stopped,\r\nwhile all the rest move without interruption. This is a very good\r\ncontrivance to preserve the instrument from being clogged by the\r\nswift motions of the wheels belonging to the Satellites of _Jupiter_\r\nand _Saturn_, when the motions of the rest of the Planets are only\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThere is also a brass lamp having two convex glasses, to be put in the\r\nroom of the Sun; and also a smaller Earth and Moon, made somewhat in\r\nproportion to their distance from each other, which may be put on at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe lamp turns round in the same time with the Earth, and by means of\r\nthe glasses cast a strong light upon her; and when the smaller Earth\r\nand Moon are placed on, it will be easy to shew when either of them may\r\nbe eclipsed.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given a brief description of the outward part of this\r\nmachine, I shall next give an account of the phænomena explained by it,\r\nwhen it is put into motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Motions of the Planets in general._\r\n\r\nHaving put on the handle, push in the pin which is just above it, and\r\nplace a small black patch (or bit of wafer) upon the middle of the Sun\r\n(for instance) right against the first degree of ♈; you may also place\r\npatches upon _Venus_, _Mars_, and _Jupiter_, right against some noted\r\npoint in the ecliptic. If you lay a thread from the Sun to the first\r\ndegree of ♈, you may set a mark where it intersects the orbit of each\r\nPlanet, and that will be a help to note the time of their revolutions.\r\n\r\nOne entire turn of the handle answers to the diurnal motion of the\r\nEarth round her axis, as may be seen by the motion of the hour index,\r\nwhich is placed at the foot of the wire on which the terella is fixed.\r\nWhen the index has moved the space of ten hours, you may observe that\r\n_Jupiter_ has made one revolution compleat round its axis; the handle\r\nbeing turned until the hour index has passed over 24 days, 8 hours,\r\nwill bring the patch upon _Venus_ to its former situation with respect\r\nto the ecliptic, which shews that ♀ has made one entire revolution\r\nround her axis. _Mars_ makes one compleat revolution round its axis\r\nin 24 hours and about 40 minutes. When the handle is turned 25½ times\r\nround, the spot upon the Sun will point to the same degree of the\r\necliptic, as it did when the instrument was first put into motion. By\r\nobserving the motions of the spots upon the surface of the Sun, and\r\nof the Planets in the heavens, their diurnal motion was discovered;\r\nafter the same manner as we do here observe the motions of their\r\nrepresentatives, by that of the marks placed upon them.\r\n\r\nIf while you turn the handle you observe the Planets, you will see\r\nthem perform their motions in the same relative times as they really\r\ndo in the heavens, each making its period in the times mentioned in\r\nthe Tables, _Page_, 28, 27¼ turns of the handle will bring the Moon\r\nround the Earth, which is called a _Periodic_ Month; and all the while\r\nshe keeps the same face towards the Earth; for the Moon’s annual and\r\ndiurnal motion are performed both in the same time nearly, so that we\r\nalways see the same face or side of the Moon.\r\n\r\nIf before the instrument is put into motion, the satellites of\r\n_Jupiter_ and _Saturn_ be brought into the same right line from their\r\nrespective primaries, you will see them, as you turn the handle,\r\nimmediately dispersed from one another, according to their different\r\ncelerities. Thus one turn of the handle will bring the first of\r\n_Jupiter_’s Moons about ⁴/₇ part round _Jupiter_, while the second has\r\ndescribed but ²/₇ part, the third but above ¹/₇, and the fourth not\r\nquite ¹/₁₆ part, each of its respective orbits. If you turn the handle\r\nuntil the hour index has moved 18½ hours more, the first satellite will\r\nthen be brought into its former position, and so has made one entire\r\nrevolution; the second at the same time will be almost diametrically\r\nopposite to the first, and so has made a little more than half of\r\none revolution; the others will be in different aspects, according\r\nto the length of their periods, as will be plainly exhibited by the\r\ninstrument. The same observations may be made with respect to the\r\nsatellites of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nThe machine is so contrived, that the handle may be turned either way;\r\nand, if before you put it into motion, you observe the aspect (or\r\nsituation with respect to each other) of the Planets, and then turn the\r\nhandle round any number of times; the same number of revolutions being\r\nmade backwards, will bring all the Planets to their former situations.\r\nI shall next proceed to particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Stations and Retrogradations of the Planets._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Retrograde Motion of the Planets._]\r\n\r\nThe primary Planets, as they all turn round the Sun, at different\r\ndistances, and in different times, appear to us from the Earth to have\r\ndifferent motions; as sometimes they appear to move from West to East,\r\naccording to the order of the signs, which is called their _Direct\r\nMotion_; then by degrees they slacken their pace, until at last they\r\nlose all their motion, and become _Stationary_, or not to move at all;\r\nthat is, they appear in the same place with respect to the fixed Stars\r\nfor some time together; after which they again begin to move, but with\r\na contrary direction, as from East to West, which is called their\r\n_Retrograde Motion_; then again they become stationary, and afterwards\r\nreassume their direct motion. The reason of all these appearances is\r\nvery evidently shewn by the _Orrery_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Stations_, &c. _of the Inferior Planets._\r\n\r\nWe shall instance in the Planet _Mercury_, because his motion round the\r\nSun differs more from the Earth’s than that of _Venus_ does.\r\n\r\nWhen _Mercury_ is in his superior conjunction (or when he is in a\r\ndirect line from the Earth beyond the Sun) fasten a string about the\r\naxis of the Earth, and extend it over _Mercury_ to the ecliptic; then\r\nturning the handle, keep the thread all the while extended over ☿,\r\nand you will find it move with a direct motion in the ecliptic, but\r\ncontinually slower, until _Mercury_ has the greatest elongation from\r\nthe Earth. Near this position, the thread for some time will lay over\r\n_Mercury_ without being moved in the ecliptic, tho’ the Earth and\r\n_Mercury_ both continue their progressive motion in their respective\r\norbits. When _Mercury_ has got a little past this place, you will find\r\nthe thread must be moved backward in the ecliptic, beginning first\r\nwith a slow motion, and then faster by degrees, until _Mercury_ is in\r\nhis inferior conjunction, or directly between the Earth and the Sun.\r\nNext this position of ☿, his retrograde motion will be the swiftest;\r\nbut he still moves the same way, tho’ continually slower, ’till he has\r\nagain come to his greatest elongation, where he will appear the second\r\ntime to be stationary; after which he begins to move forward, and that\r\nfaster by degrees, until he is come to the same position with respect\r\nto the Earth, that he was in at first. The same observations may be\r\nmade relating to the motions of _Venus_. In like manner the different\r\nmotions observed in the superior Planets may be also explained by the\r\n_Orrery_. If you extend the thread over _Jupiter_, and proceed after\r\nthe same manner as before we did in regard to _Mercury_, you will\r\nfind that from the time _Jupiter_ is in conjunction with the Sun, his\r\nmotion is direct, but continually slower, until the Earth is nearly in\r\na quadrate aspect with _Jupiter_, near which position _Jupiter_ seems\r\nto be stationary: After which he begins to move, and continually mends\r\nhis pace, until he comes in opposition to the Sun, at which time his\r\nretrograde motion is swiftest. He still seems to go backward, but with\r\na slower pace, ’till the Earth and he are again in a quadrate aspect,\r\nwhere _Jupiter_ seems to have lost all his motion; after which he again\r\nresumes his direct motion, and so proceeds faster by degrees, ’till the\r\nEarth and he are again in opposition to each another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Plate 3_. _Fig. 1_.]\r\n\r\nThese different motions observed in the Planets, are easily\r\nillustrated, as followeth: The lesser circle round the Sun is the\r\norbit of _Mercury_, in which he performs his revolution round the\r\nSun, in about three months, or while the Earth is going thro’ ¼ part\r\nof her orbit, or from A to N. The numbers 1, 2, 3, _&c._ in the orbit\r\nof _Mercury_, show the spaces he describes in a week nearly, and the\r\ndistance AB, BC, DC, _&c._ in the Earth’s orbit, do likewise show her\r\nmotion in the same time. The letters A, B, C, _&c._ in the great orb,\r\nare the motions of _Mercury_ in the Heavens, as they appear from the\r\nEarth. Now if the Earth be supposed in A, and _Mercury_ in 12, near his\r\nsuperior conjunction with the Sun; a spectator on the Earth will see ☿,\r\nas if he were in the point of the Heavens A, and while ☿ is moving from\r\n12 to 1, and from 1 to 2, _&c._ the Earth in the same time also moves\r\nfrom A to B, and from B to C, _&c._ All which time ☿ appears in the\r\nHeavens to move in a direct motion from A to B, and from B to C, _&c._\r\nbut gradually slower, until he arrives near the point G; near this\r\nplace he appears stationary, or to stand still; and afterwards (tho’ he\r\nstill continues to move uniformly in his own orbit, with a progressive\r\nmotion) yet in the sphere of the fixed Stars he will appear to be\r\nretrograde, or to go backwards, as from G to H, from H to I, _&c._\r\nuntil he has arrived near the point L, where again he will appear to be\r\nstationary; and afterwards to move in a direct motion from L to M, and\r\nfrom M to N, _&c._\r\n\r\nWhat has been here shewed concerning the motions of _Mercury_, is\r\nalso to be understood of the motions of _Venus_; but the conjunctions\r\nof _Venus_ with the Sun do not happen so often as in _Mercury_; for\r\n_Venus_ moving in a larger orbit, and much slower than _Mercury_, does\r\nnot so often overtake the Earth. But the retrogradations are much\r\ngreater in _Venus_ than they are in _Mercury_, for the same reasons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\nThe innermost circle represents the Earth’s orbit, divided into 12\r\nparts, answering to her monthly motion; the greatest circle is in the\r\norbit of _Jupiter_, which he describes in about 12 years; and therefore\r\nthe ¹/₁₂ thereof, from A to N, defines his motion, in one of our years\r\nnearly; and the intermediate divisions, A, B, C, _&c._ his monthly\r\nmotion. Let us suppose the Earth to be in the point of her orbit 12,\r\nand _Jupiter_ in A, in his conjunction with the Sun; it is evident\r\nthat from the Earth _Jupiter_ will be seen in the great orb, or in the\r\npoint of the Heavens A, and while the Earth is moving from 12 to 1, 2,\r\n_&c._ ♃ also moves from A to B, _&c._ all which time he appears in the\r\nHeavens to move with a direct motion from A to B, C, _&c._, until he\r\ncomes in opposition to the Earth near the point of the Heavens E, where\r\nhe appears to be stationary; after which ♃ again begins to move (tho’\r\nat first with a slow pace) from E through F, H, I to K, where again he\r\nappears to stand still, but afterwards he reassumes his direct motion\r\nfrom I thro’ K, to M, _&c._\r\n\r\nFrom the construction of the preceding figure it appears, that when\r\nthe superior Planets are in conjunction with the Sun, their direct\r\nmotion is much quicker than at other times; and that because they\r\nreally move from West to East, while the Earth in the opposite part\r\nof the Heavens is carried the same way, and round the same center.\r\nThis motion afterwards continually slackens until the Planet comes\r\nalmost in opposition to the Sun, when the line joining the Earth and\r\nPlanet, will continue for some time nearly parallel to itself, and so\r\nthe Planet seems from the Earth to stand still; after which, it begins\r\nto move with a slow motion backward, until it comes into a quartile\r\naspect with the Sun, when again it will appear to be stationary, for\r\nthe above reasons; after that it will resume its direct motion, until\r\nit comes into a conjunction with the Sun, then it will proceed as above\r\nexplained. Hence it also appears, that the retrogradations of the\r\nsuperior Planets are much slower than their direct motions, and their\r\ncontinuance much shorter; for the Planet, from its last quarter, until\r\nit comes in opposition to the Sun, appears to move the same way with\r\nthe Earth, by whom it is then overtaken: After which it begins to go\r\nbackwards, but with a slow motion, because the Earth being in the same\r\npart of the Heavens, and moving the same way that the Planet really\r\ndoes, the apparent motion of the Planet backwards, must thereby be\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nWhat has been here said concerning the motions of _Jupiter_, is also\r\nto be understood of _Mars_ and _Saturn_. But the retrogradations\r\nof _Saturn_ do oftener happen than those of _Jupiter_, because the\r\nEarth oftener overtakes _Saturn_; and for the same reason, the\r\nregressions of _Jupiter_ do oftener happen than those of _Mars_. But\r\nthe retrogradations of _Mars_ are much greater than those of _Jupiter_,\r\nwhose are also much greater than those of _Saturn_.\r\n\r\nIn either of the satellites of _Jupiter_ or _Saturn_, these different\r\nappearances in the neighbouring Worlds are much oftener seen than they\r\nare by us in the primary Planets.\r\n\r\nWe never observe these different motions in the Moon, because she turns\r\nround the Earth as her center; neither do we observe them in the Sun,\r\nbecause he is the center of the Earth’s motion; whence the apparent\r\nmotion of the Sun always appears the same way round the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Of the Annual and Diurnal Motion of the Earth, and of\r\n        the increase and decrease of Days and Nights._\r\n\r\nThe Earth in her annual motion round the Sun, has her axis always in\r\nthe same direction, or parallel to itself; that is, if a line be drawn\r\nparallel to the axis, while the Earth is in any point of her orbit, the\r\naxis in all other positions of the Earth will be parallel to the said\r\nline. This parallelism of the axis, and the simple motion of the Earth\r\nin the ecliptic, solves all the phænomena of different seasons. These\r\nthings are very well illustrated by the _Orrery_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 3.]\r\n\r\nIf you put on the lamp in the place of the Sun, you will see how one\r\nhalf of our globe is always illuminated by the Sun, while the other\r\nhemisphere remains in darkness; how Day and Night are formed by the\r\nrevolution of the Earth round her axis; for as she turns from West to\r\nEast, the Sun appears to move from East to West. And while the Earth\r\nturns in her orbit, you may observe that her axis always points the\r\nsame way, and the several seasons of the year continually change.\r\n\r\nTo make these things plainer, we will take a view of the Earth in\r\ndifferent parts of her orbit.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earth is in the first point of _Libra_ (which is found by\r\nextending a thread from the Sun, and over the Earth, to the ecliptic)\r\nwe have the _Vernal Equinox_, and the Sun at that time appears in the\r\nfirst point of ♈. In this position of the Earth, two Poles of the world\r\nare in the line separating light and darkness; and as the Earth turns\r\nround her axis, just one half of the equator, and all its parallels,\r\nwill be in the light, and the other half in the dark; and therefore the\r\ndays and nights must be every where equal.\r\n\r\nAs the Earth moves along in her orbit, you will perceive the North\r\nPole advances by degrees into the illuminated hemisphere, and at the\r\nsame time the South Pole recedes into darkness; and in all places to\r\nthe Northward of the equator, the days continually lengthen, while the\r\ncontrary happens in the Southern parts, until at length the Earth is\r\narrived in _Capricorn_. In this position of the Earth all the space\r\nincluded within the arctic circle falls wholly within the light, and\r\nall the opposite part lying within the antarctic circle, is quite\r\ninvolved in darkness. In all places between the equator and the arctic\r\ncircle, the days are now at the longest, and are gradually longer, as\r\nthe place are more remote from the equator. In the Southern hemisphere\r\nthere is a contrary effect. All the while the Earth is travelling from\r\n_Capricorn_ towards _Aries_, the North Pole gradually recedes from the\r\nlight, and the South Pole approaches nearer to it; the days in the\r\nNorthern hemisphere gradually decrease, and in the Southern hemisphere\r\nthey increase in the same proportion, until the Earth be arrived in\r\n♈; then the two Poles of the world lie exactly in the line separating\r\nlight and darkness, and the days are equal to the nights in all places\r\nof the world. As the Earth advances towards _Cancer_, the North Pole\r\ngradually recedes from the light, while the Southern one advances into\r\nit, at the same rate. In the Northern hemisphere the days decrease,\r\nand in the Southern one they gradually lengthen, until the Earth being\r\narrived in _Cancer_, the North frigid Zone is all involved in darkness,\r\nand the South frigid Zone falls intirely within the light; the days\r\nevery where in the Northern hemisphere are now at the shortest, and to\r\nthe Southward they are at the longest. As the Earth moves from hence\r\ntowards _Libra_, the North Pole gradually approaches the light, and\r\nthe other recedes from it; and in all places to the Northward of the\r\nequator, the days now lengthen, while in the opposite hemisphere they\r\ngradually shorten, until the Earth has gotten into ♎; in which position\r\nthe days and nights will again be of equal length in all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nYou might have observed that in all positions of the Earth, one half\r\nof the equator was in the light, and the other half in darkness;\r\nwhence under the equator, the days and nights are always of the same\r\nlength: And all the while the Earth was going from ♎ towards ♈, the\r\nNorth Pole was constantly illuminated, and the South Pole all the\r\nwhile in darkness; and for the other half year, the contrary. Sometimes\r\nthere is a semicircle exactly facing the Sun, fixed over the middle of\r\nthe Earth, which may be called the horizon of the disk: This will do\r\ninstead of the lamp, if that half of the Earth which is next the Sun be\r\nconsidered, as being the illuminated hemisphere, and the other half, to\r\nbe that which lies in darkness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Plate 4._]\r\n\r\nThe great circle ♈, ♉, ♊ &_c._ represent the Earth’s annual orbit; and\r\nthe four lesser circles ESQC, the ecliptic, upon the surface of the\r\nEarth, coinciding with the great ecliptic in the Heavens. These four\r\nlesser figures represent the Earth in the four cardinal points of the\r\necliptic, P being the North Pole of the equator, and _p_ the North Pole\r\nof the ecliptic; SPC, the solstitial colure which is always parallel to\r\nthe great solstitial colure ♋ ☉ ♑ in the Heavens; EPQ the equinoctial\r\ncolure. The other circles passing thro’ P, are meridians at two hours\r\ndistance from one another; the semicircle EÆQ is the Northern half of\r\nthe equator; the parallel circle touching the ecliptic in S, is the\r\ntropic of _Cancer_; the dotted circle, the parallel of _London_, and\r\nthe small circle, touching the Pole of the ecliptic, is the _Arctic\r\nCircle_. The shaded part, which is always opposite to the Sun, is the\r\nobscure hemisphere, or that which lies in darkness; and that which is\r\nnext the Sun, is the illuminated hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the Earth in ♎, she will then see the Sun in ♈ (which\r\nmakes our vernal equinox) and in this position the circle bounding\r\nlight and darkness, which here is SC, passes thro’ the Poles of the\r\nWorld, and bisects all the parallels of the equator; and therefore the\r\ndiurnal and nocturnal arches, or the length of the days and nights, are\r\nequal in all places of the world.\r\n\r\nBut while the Earth in her annual course, moves through ♏, ♐, to ♑, the\r\nline SC, keeping still parallel to itself, or to the place where it was\r\nat first, the Pole P will, by this motion, gradually advance into the\r\nilluminated hemisphere; and also the diurnal arches of the parallels\r\ngradually increase, and consequently the nocturnal ones decrease in\r\nthe same proportion, until the Earth has arrived into ♑; in which\r\nposition the Pole P, and all the space within the arctic circle, fall\r\nwholly within the illuminated hemisphere, and the diurnal arches of all\r\nthe parallels that are without this circle, will exceed the nocturnal\r\narches more or less, as the places are nearer to, or farther off from\r\nit, until the distance from the Pole is as far as the equator, where\r\nboth these arches are always equal.\r\n\r\nAgain, while the Earth is moving from ♑ through ♒, ♓, to ♈, the Pole P\r\nbegins to incline to the line, distinguishing light and darkness, in\r\nthe same proportion that before it receded from it; and consequently\r\nthe diurnal arches gradually lessen, until the Earth has arrived into\r\n♈ where the Pole P will again fall on the horizon, and so cause the\r\ndays and nights to be every where equal. But when the Earth has passed\r\n♈, while she is going thro’ ♉, and ♊, _&c._ the Pole P will begin to\r\nfall in the obscure hemisphere, and so recede gradually from the light,\r\nuntil the Earth is arrived in ♋; in which position not only the Pole,\r\nbut all the space within the arctic circle, are involved in darkness,\r\nand the diurnal arches of all the parallels, without the arctic circle,\r\nare equal to the nocturnal arches of the same parallels, when the\r\nEarth was in the opposite point ♑; and it is evident that the days are\r\nnow at the shortest, and the nights the longest. But when the Earth\r\nhas past this point, while she is going through ♌ and ♏, the Pole P\r\nwill again gradually approach the light, and so the diurnal arches of\r\nthe parallels gradually lengthen, until the Earth is arrived in ♎; at\r\nwhich time the days and nights will again be equal in all places of the\r\nWorld, and the Pole itself just see the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 4.]\r\n\r\nHere we only considered the phænomena belonging to the Northern\r\nparallels; but if the Pole P be made the South Pole, then all the\r\nparallels of latitude will be parallels of South latitude, and the\r\ndays, every where, in any position of the Earth, will be equal to the\r\nnights of those who lived in the opposite hemisphere, under the same\r\nparallels.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Phases of the Moon, and of her Motion\r\n        in her Orbit._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nodes._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dragon’s Head._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dragon’s Tail._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Retrograde Motion of the Nodes._]\r\n\r\nThe orbit of the Moon makes an angle with the plane of the ecliptic, of\r\nabove 5¼ degrees, and cuts it into two points, diametrically opposite\r\n(after the same manner as the equator and the ecliptic cut each other\r\nupon the globe, in ♈ and ♎) which points are called the _Nodes_; and\r\na right line joining these points, and passing through the center of\r\nthe Earth, is called the _Line of the Nodes_. That node where the\r\nMoon begins to ascend Northward above the plane of the ecliptic, is\r\ncalled the _Ascending Node_, and the _Head of the Dragon_, and is thus\r\ncommonly marked [Symbol]. The other node from whence the Moon, descends\r\nto the Southward of the ecliptic, is called the _Descending Node_, and\r\nthe _Dragon’s Tail_, and is thus marked [Symbol]. The line of nodes\r\ncontinually shifts itself from East to West, contrary to the order of\r\nthe signs; and with this _retrograde_ motion, makes one revolution\r\nround the Earth, in the space of about 19 years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Periodical Month._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Synodical Month._]\r\n\r\nThe Moon describes its orbit round the Earth in the Space of 27 days\r\nand 7 hours, which space of time is called a _Periodical Month_; yet\r\nfrom one conjunction to the next, the Moon spends 29 days and a half,\r\nwhich is called a _Synodical Month_; because while the Moon in her\r\nproper _Orbit_ finishes her course, the Earth advances near a whole\r\nsign in the ecliptic; which space the Moon has still to describe,\r\nbefore she will be seen in conjunction with the Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun, note her place in the\r\necliptic; then turning the handle, you will find that 27 days and 7\r\nhours will bring the Moon to the same place; and after you have made\r\n2¼ revolutions more, the Moon will be exactly betwixt the Sun and the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Phases of the Moon._]\r\n\r\nThe Moon all the while keeps in her orbit, and so the wire that\r\nSupports her continually rises or falls in a socket, as she changes her\r\nlatitude; the black cap shifts itself, and so shews the phases of the\r\nMoon, according to her age, or how much of her enlightened part is seen\r\nfrom the Earth. In one synodical month, the line of the nodes moves\r\nabout 1½ degree from West to East, and so makes one entire revolution\r\nin 19 years.\r\n\r\nLet AB be an arch of the Earth’s orbit, and when the Earth is in\r\nT, let the Moon be in N, in conjunction with the Sun in S, while\r\nthe Moon is describing her orbit NAFD, the Earth will describe the\r\narch of her orbit T _t_; and when the Earth has got into the point\r\n_t_, the Moon will be in the point of her orbit _n_, having made\r\none compleat revolution round the Earth. But the Moon, before she\r\ncomes in conjunction with the Sun, must again describe the arch _n\r\no_; which arch is similar to T _t_, because the lines FN, _f n_, are\r\nparallel; and because, while the Moon describes the arch _n o_, the\r\nEarth advances forward in the ecliptic; the arch described by the\r\nMoon, after she has finished her periodical month, before she makes a\r\nsynodical month, must be somewhat greater than _n o_. To determine the\r\nmean length of a synodical month, find the diurnal motion of the Moon\r\n(or the space she describes round the Earth in one day) and likewise\r\nthe diurnal motion of the Earth; then the difference betwixt the two\r\nmotions, is the apparent motion of the Moon round the Earth in one day;\r\nthen it will be, as this differential arch is to a whole circle; so is\r\none day to that space of time wherein the Moon appears to describe a\r\ncompleat circle round the Earth, which is about 29½ days. But this is\r\nnot always a true _Lunation_, for the motion of the Moon is sometimes\r\nfaster, and sometimes slower, according to the position of the Earth in\r\nher orbit.\r\n\r\nIn one synodical month the Moon has all manner of aspects with the\r\nSun and Earth, and because she is opaque, that face of hers will only\r\nappear bright which is towards the Sun, while the opposite remains in\r\ndarkness. But the inhabitants of the Earth can only see that face of\r\nthe Moon which is turned towards the Earth; and therefore, according to\r\nthe various positions of the Moon, in respect of the Sun and Earth, we\r\nobserve different portions of her illuminated face, and so a continual\r\nchange in her[7]_Phases_.\r\n\r\nLet S be the Sun, RTV an arch of the Earth’s orbit, T the Earth, and\r\nthe circle ABCD, _&c._ the Moon’s orbit, in which she turns round the\r\nEarth in the space of a month; and let A, B, C, _&c._ be the centers of\r\nthe Moon in different parts of her orbit.\r\n\r\nNow if with the lines S A, S B, _&c._ we join the centers of the Sun\r\nand Moon, and at right angles to these draw the lines H O; the said\r\nlines H O will be the circles that separate the illuminated part of the\r\nMoon from the dark and obscure. Again, if we conceive another line I\r\nL to be drawn at right angles to the lines TA, TB, _&c._ passing from\r\nthe center of the Earth to the Moon, the said line I L will divide the\r\nvisible hemisphere of the Moon, or that which is turned towards us,\r\nfrom the invisible, or that which is turned from us; and this circle\r\nmay be called the _Circle of Vision_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Full Moon._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Half Moon._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _New Moon._]\r\n\r\nNow it is manifest, that whenever the Moon is in the position A, or in\r\nthat point of her orbit which is opposite to the Sun, the circle of\r\nvision, and the circle bounding light and darkness, do coincide, and\r\nall the illuminated face of the Moon is turned towards the Earth, and\r\nis visible to us; and in this position the _Moon_ is said to be _full_.\r\nBut when the Moon arrives to B, all her illuminated face is then not\r\ntowards the Earth, there being a part of it, HBI, not to be seen by\r\nus; and then her visible face is deficient from a circle, and appears\r\nof a gibbous form, as in B. _Fig. 3_. Again when she arrives to C, the\r\ntwo forementioned circles cut each other at right angles, and then we\r\nobserve a _half Moon_, as in C, _Fig. 3_. And again the illuminated\r\nface of the Moon is more and more turned from the Earth, until she\r\ncomes to the Point E, where the circle of vision, and that bounding\r\nlight and darkness, do again coincide. Here the Moon disappears, the\r\nilluminated part being wholly turned from the Earth; and she is now\r\nsaid to be in _Conjunction_ with the _Sun_, because she is in the\r\nsame direction from the Earth that the Sun is in, which position we\r\ncall a _New Moon_. When the Moon is arrived to F, she again assumes\r\na horned figure, but her horns (which before the change were turned\r\nWestward) have now changed their position, and look Eastward. When she\r\nhas arrived to a quadrate aspect at G, she will appear bissected, like\r\na half Moon, afterwards she will still grow bigger, until at last she\r\ncomes to A, where again she will appear in her full splendor.\r\n\r\nThe same appearances which we observe in the Moon are likewise observed\r\nby the _Lunarians_ in the Earth, our Earth seeing a Moon to them, as\r\ntheir Moon is to us; and we are observed by them to be carried round\r\nin the space of time that they are really carried round the Earth. But\r\nthe same phases of the Earth and Moon happen when they are in contrary\r\nposition; for when the Moon is in conjunction to us, the Earth is then\r\nin opposition to the Moon, and the _Lunarians_ have then a full Earth,\r\nas we in a similar position have a full Moon. When the Moon comes in\r\nopposition to the Sun, the Earth, seen from the Moon, will appear in\r\nconjunction with her, and in that position the Earth will disappear;\r\nafterwards she will assume a horned figure, and so shew the same phases\r\nto the inhabitants of the Moon as she does to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Eclipses of the Sun and Moon._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Eclipse._]\r\n\r\nAn _Eclipse_ is that deprivation of light in a Planet, when another is\r\ninterposed betwixt it and the Sun. Thus, an eclipse of the Sun is made\r\nby the interposition of the Moon at her conjunction, and an eclipse\r\nof the Moon is occasioned by the shadow of the Earth falling upon the\r\nMoon, when she is in opposition to the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 4_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lunar Eclipse._]\r\n\r\nLet S be the Sun, T the Earth, and ABC its shadow; now if the Moon,\r\nwhen she is in opposition to the Sun, should come into the conical\r\nspace ABC, she will then be deprived of the solar light, and so undergo\r\nan eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Solar Eclipse._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 5._]\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, when the shadow of the Moon falls upon the Earth\r\n(which can never happen but when the Moon is in conjunction with\r\nthe Sun) that part upon which the shadow falls will be involved in\r\ndarkness, and the Sun eclipsed. But because the Moon is much less than\r\nthe Earth, the shadow of the ☽ cannot cover the whole Earth, but only a\r\npart of it. Let S be the Sun, T the Earth, ABC the Moon’s orbit, and L\r\nthe Moon in conjunction with the Sun: Here the shadow of the Moon falls\r\nonly upon the part DE of the Earth’s surface, and there only the Sun\r\nis intirely hid: but there are other parts EF, DG, on each side of the\r\nshadow, where the inhabitants are deprived of part of the Solar rays,\r\nand that more or less, according to their distance from the shadow.\r\nThose who live at H and I will see half of the Sun eclipsed, but in the\r\nspaces FM, GN, all the Sun’s body will be visible, without any eclipse.\r\nFrom the preceding figure it appears, that an eclipse of the Sun does\r\nnot reach a great way upon the superficies of the Earth; but the whole\r\nbody of the Moon may sometimes be involved in the Earth’s shadow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 6._]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Moon seen from the Earth, and the Earth seen from the\r\nMoon, are each alternately, once a month, in conjunction with the Sun;\r\nyet, by reason of the inclination of the Moon’s orbit to the ecliptic,\r\nthe Sun is not eclipsed every new Moon, nor the Moon at every full.\r\nLet T be the Earth, DTE an arch of the ecliptic, ALBF, the Moon’s\r\norbit, having the Earth T, in its center; and let AGBG be another\r\ncircle coinciding with the ecliptic, and A, B, the nodes, or the two\r\npoints where the Moon’s orbit and the ecliptic cut each other. A the\r\nascending node, and B the descending node. The angle GAL equal to GBL\r\nis the inclination of the Moon’s orbit to the ecliptic, being about\r\n5¼ degrees. Now a spectator from the Earth at T, will observe the Sun\r\nto move in the circle AGBC, and the Moon in her orbit ALBF; whence it\r\nis evident, that the Sun and Moon can never be seen in a direct line,\r\nfrom the center of the Earth, but when the Moon is in one of the nodes\r\nA or B; and then only will the Sun appear centrally eclipsed. But if\r\nthe conjunction of the Moon happens when she is any where within the\r\ndistance A _c_ of the nodes, either North or South, the Sun will then\r\nbe eclipsed, more or less, according to the distance from the node A,\r\nor B. If the conjunction happens when the Moon is in _b_, the Sun will\r\nbe then one half eclipsed; and if it happens when she is in _c_, the\r\nMoon’s limb will just touch the Sun’s disk, without hiding any part of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of the Earth at the place where the Moon’s orbit intersects\r\nit, is three times as large as the Moon’s diameter, as in _Fig. 4._ and\r\ntherefore it often happens that eclipses of the Moon are total, when\r\nthey are not central: And for the same reason the Moon may sometimes be\r\ntotally eclipsed for three hours together; whereas total eclipses of\r\nthe Sun can scarcely ever exceed four minutes.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of the Sun and Moon are very well explained by the\r\n_Orrery_: Thus having put the lamp in the place of the Sun, and the\r\nlittle Earth and the little Moon in their proper places, instead of the\r\nlarger ones, let the room wherein the instrument stands be darkened;\r\nthen turning the handle about, you will see when the conjunction of the\r\nMoon happens. When she is in or near one of the nodes, her shadow will\r\nfall upon the Earth, and so deprive that part upon which it falls of\r\nthe light of the Sun: If the conjunction happens when the Moon is not\r\nnear one of the nodes, the light of the lamp will fall upon the Earth,\r\neither above or below the Moon, according to her latitude at that time.\r\nIn like manner, when the full Moon happens near one of the nodes,\r\nthe shadow of the Earth will fall upon the Moon; and if the Moon’s\r\nlatitude be but small, her whole face will be involved in darkness. At\r\nother times, when the full Moon happens when she is not near one of\r\nher nodes, the shadow of the Earth will pass either above or below the\r\nMoon, and so by that means the Moon will escape being eclipsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Eclipses of the_ Satellites _of_ Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe apparent diameters of the inferior Planets are so small, that when\r\nthey pass betwixt us and the Sun, they only appear like small spots\r\nupon the Sun’s surface, without depriving us of any sensible quantity\r\nof his light. The shadow of the Earth likewise terminates before it\r\nreaches any of the superior Planets, so that they are never eclipsed by\r\nus; and the Earth when she is in conjunction with the Sun, only appears\r\nlike a black spot upon his surface.\r\n\r\nBut _Jupiter_ and his Moons mutually eclipse each other, as our Earth\r\nand Moon do; as also doth _Saturn_ and his Moons. The satellites of\r\n_Jupiter_ become twice hid from us, in one circulation round ♃; _viz._\r\nonce behind the body of _Jupiter_, _i. e._ when they are in the right\r\nline joining the centers of the Earth and ♃; and again they become\r\ninvisible when they enter the shadow of _Jupiter_, which happens when\r\nthey are at their Full, as seen from ♃, at which times they also suffer\r\neclipses; which eclipses happen to them after the same manner as they\r\ndo to our Moon, by the interposition of the Earth betwixt her and the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fig. 7._]\r\n\r\nLet S be the Sun, ABT the Earth’s orbit; and C ♃ D, an arch of\r\n_Jupiter_’s orbit, in which let _Jupiter_ be in the point ♃; and let\r\nCFDH be the orbit of one of _Jupiter_’s satellites, which we will here\r\nsuppose to be the farthest from him. These satellites, while they move\r\nthro’ the inferior parts of their orbs, _viz._ from D thro’ H, I, to\r\nC, seem from the Earth and the Sun to have a retrograde motion; but\r\nwhen they are in the superior part of their orbit, they are then seen\r\nto move from West to East, according to their true motion. Now while\r\nthey describe the superior part of their orbits, they will be twice hid\r\nfrom the Earth, once in the shadow of ♃, and once behind his body. If\r\n_Jupiter_ be more Westerly than the Sun, that is, when the Earth is in\r\nA, they will be first hid in the shadow F, and afterwards behind the\r\nbody of ♃ in G: But when the Earth is in B, then they are first hid\r\nbehind ♃’s body in E, and afterwards fall into the shadow F. While the\r\nsatellites describe the inferior parts of their orbit, they only once\r\ndisappear, which may be either in I or H, according to the position of\r\nthe Earth, in which places they cannot be distinguished from the body\r\nof _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 5\r\n\r\n_Fig. I_\r\n\r\n_Fig. II_\r\n\r\n_Fig. III_\r\n\r\n_Fig. IV_\r\n\r\n_Fig. V_\r\n\r\n_Fig. VI_\r\n\r\n_Fig. VII_]\r\n\r\nWhen the satellites seen from ♃ are in conjunction with the Sun, their\r\nshadows will then fall upon ♃, and some part of his body be involved in\r\ndarkness, to which part the Sun will be totally eclipsed.\r\n\r\nBy observing the eclipses of _Jupiter_’s satellites, it was first\r\ndiscovered that light is not propogated instantaneously, though it\r\nmoves with an incredible swiftness: For if light came to us in an\r\ninstant, an observer in T will see an eclipse of one of the satellites,\r\nat the same time that another in K would. But it has been found by\r\nobservations, that when the Earth is in K, at her nearest distance from\r\n_Jupiter_, these eclipses happen much sooner than when she is in T.\r\nNow having the difference of time betwixt these appearances in K and\r\nT, we may find the length of time the light takes in passing from K to\r\nT, which space is equal to the diameter of the Earth’s annual orb. By\r\nthese kinds of observations it has been found, that light reaches from\r\nthe Sun to us in the space of eleven minutes of time, which is at least\r\nat the rate of 100,000 miles in a second.\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDEX OF THE ASTRONOMICAL TERMS Made Use of in this BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Acronical_ Rising and Setting of the Stars     Page 96\r\n

B. According to _Biachini_’s Observations, _Venus_’s axis\r\ninclines 75 degrees from the perpendicular to the plane of the Ecliptic\r\n(which is 51½ deg. more than the axis of our Earth) her Tropics are\r\nonly 15 deg. from her Poles, and her Polar Circles at the same distance\r\nfrom her _Equator_; so that the Sun’s greatest Declination on each side\r\nof her _Equator_ is 75 deg. by which she must undergo a much greater\r\nvariety of seasons than we do on our Earth.\r\n\r\n[3] ☌ Is a mark commonly used for conjunction; thus ☌ with the ☉, is to\r\nbe read conjunction with the Sun.\r\n\r\n[4] _Prob. VI._\r\n\r\n[5] _Prob._ XIII.\r\n\r\n[6] The insensible change in the Longitude, Right Ascension, and\r\nDeclination of the Fixed Stars, made by their slow motion, parallel to\r\nthe ecliptic (being but 1 degree in 72 years) is not worth notice in\r\nthis place.\r\n\r\n[7] _Phases_ of the Moon are those different appearances we observe in\r\nher, according to her position in respect to the Sun and Earth.",
