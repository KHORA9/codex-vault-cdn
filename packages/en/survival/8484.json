Their habits are unfortunately too well\r\nknown to cultivators, who justly dread their incursions among cultivated\r\nplants like flax, hops, etc.\r\n\r\nAll parasitic plants, or at least the majority of them, have one\r\ncharacter in common which distinguishes them at first sight. In many\r\ncases green matter is wanting in their tissues or is hidden by a\r\nlivid tint that strikes the observer. Such are the Orobanchaccæ, or\r\n\"broomropes,\" and the tropical Balanophoraceæ. Nevertheless, other\r\nparasites, such as the mistletoe, have perfectly green leaves.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the naturalist's attention is attracted every time\r\nhe finds a plant deprived of chlorophyl, and one in which the leaves\r\nseem to be wanting, as in the dodder that occupies us. In fact, as the\r\nmajority of parasites take their nourishment at the expense of the\r\nplants upon which they fasten themselves, they have no need, as a\r\ngeneral thing, of elaborating through their foliar organs the materials\r\nthat their hosts derive from the air; in a word, they do not breathe\r\nactively like the latter, since they find the elements of their\r\nnutrition already prepared in the sap of their nurses. The dodders,\r\nthen, are essentially parasites, and their apparent simplicity gives\r\nthem a very peculiar aspect. Their leaves are wholly wanting, or are\r\nindicated by small, imperceptible scales, and their organs of vegetation\r\nare reduced to a stem and filiform branches that have obtained for them\r\nthe names of _Cheveux de Venus_ (Venus' Hair) and _Cheveux du Diable_\r\n(devil's hair) in French, and gold thread in English. Because of their\r\ndestructive nature they have likewise been called by the unpoetic name\r\nof hellweed; and, for the reason that they embrace their host plants so\r\nclosely, they have been called love weed and love vine.\r\n\r\nWhen a seed of _Cuscuta_, germinates, no cotyledons are to be\r\ndistinguished. This peculiarity, however, the plant has in common with\r\nother parasites, and even with some plants, such as orchids, that\r\nvegetate normally. The radicle of the dodder fixes itself in the earth,\r\nand the little stem rises as in other dicotyledons; but soon (for the\r\nplantlet could not live long thus) this stem, which is as slender as a\r\nthread, seeks support upon some neighboring plant, and produces upon\r\nits surfaces of contact one or more little protuberances that shortly\r\nafterward adhere firmly to the support and take on the appearance and\r\nfunctions of cupping glasses. At this point there forms a prolongation\r\nof the tissue of the dodder--a sort of cone, which penetrates the stalk\r\nof the host plant. After this, through the increase of the stem and\r\nbranches of the parasite, the supporting plant becomes interlaced on\r\nevery side, and, if it does not die from the embraces of its enemy, its\r\nexistence is notably hazarded. It is possible for a _Cuscuta_ plant to\r\nwork destruction over a space two meters in diameter in a lucern or\r\nclover field; so, should a hundred seeds germinate in an acre, it may be\r\neasily seen how disastrous the effects of the scourge would prove.\r\n\r\nThese enemies of our agriculture were scarcely to be regarded as\r\ninjurious not very many years ago, for the reason that their sources of\r\ndevelopment were wanting. Lucern and clover are comparatively recent\r\nintroductions into France, at least as forage plants. Other cultures are\r\noften sorely tried by the dodder, and what is peculiar is that there are\r\nalmost always species that are special to such or such a plant, so that\r\nthe botanist usually knows beforehand how to determine the parasite\r\nwhose presence is made known to him. Thus, the _Cuscuta_ of flax, called\r\nby the French _Bourreau du Lin_ (the flax's executioner), and by the\r\nEnglish, flax dodder, grows only upon this textile plant, the crop of\r\nwhich it often ruins. On account of this, botanists call this species\r\nCuscuta epilinum. Others, such as C. Europæa, attack by preference hemp\r\nand nettle. Finally, certain species are unfortunately indifferent and\r\ntake possession of any plant that will nourish them. Of this number is\r\nthe one that we are about to speak of.\r\n\r\nAttempts have sometimes been made out of curiosity to cultivate exotic\r\nspecies. One of the head gardeners at the Paris Museum received\r\nspecimens of _Cuscuta reflexa_ from India about two years ago, and,\r\nhaving placed it upon a geranium plant, succeeded in cultivating it.\r\nSince then, other plants have been selected, and the parasite has been\r\nfound to develop upon all of them. What adds interest to this species\r\nis that its flowers are relatively larger and that they emit a pleasant\r\nodor of hawthorn. Mr. Hamelin thinks that by reason of these advantages,\r\nan ornamental plant might be made of it, or at least a plant that would\r\nbe sought by lovers of novelties. Like the majority of dodders, this\r\nspecies is an annual, so that, as soon as the cycle of vegetation is\r\naccomplished, the plant dies after flowering and fruiting. But here the\r\nseeds do not arrive at maturity, and the plant has to be propagated by\r\na peculiar method. At the moment when vegetation is active, it is only\r\nnecessary to take a bit of the stem, and then, after previously lifting\r\na piece of the bark of the plant upon which it is to be placed, to apply\r\nthis fragment of _Cuscuta_ thereto (as in grafting), place the bark over\r\nit, and bind a ligature round the whole. In a short time the graft will\r\nbud, and in a few months the host plant will be covered with it.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Cuscuta_ embraces more than eighty species, which are\r\ndistributed throughout the entire world, but which are not so abundant\r\nin cold as in warm regions.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NEW EXOTIC DODDER. (_Cuscuta Reflexa_.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT BOTANICAL INVESTIGATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that there is a great difference between the\r\ntranspiration and evaporation of water in plants. The former takes place\r\nin an atmosphere saturated with moisture, it is influenced by light,\r\nby an equable temperature, while evaporation ceases in a saturated\r\natmosphere. M. Leclerc has very carefully examined this question, and he\r\nconcludes that transpiration is only the simple evaporation of water. If\r\ntranspiration is more active in the plant exposed to the sun, that is\r\ndue to the heat rays, and in addition arises in part from the fact that\r\nthe assimilating action of chlorophyl heats the tissues, which in turn\r\nraises the temperature and facilitates evaporation.\r\n\r\nAs to transpiration taking place in a saturated atmosphere, it is a\r\nmistake; generally there is a difference in the temperature of the plant\r\nand the air, and the air is not saturated in its vicinity. In a word,\r\ntranspiration and evaporation is the same thing.\r\n\r\nHerr Reinke has made an interesting examination of the action of light\r\non a plant. He has permitted a pencil of sun rays to pass through a\r\nconverging lens upon a cell containing a fragment of an aquatic plant.\r\nHe was enabled to increase the intensity of the light, so that it should\r\nbe stronger or weaker than the direct sunlight. He could thus vary its\r\nintensity from 1/16 of that of direct sunlight to an intensity 64 times\r\nstronger. The temperature was maintained constant.\r\n\r\nHerr Reinke has shown that the chlorophyl action increases regularly\r\nwith the light for intensities under that of direct sunlight; but what\r\nis unexpected, that for the higher intensities above that of ordinary\r\ndaylight the disengagement of oxygen remains constant.\r\n\r\nM. Leclerc du Sablon has published some of his results in his work on\r\nthe opening of fruits. The influences which act upon fruit are external\r\nand internal. The external cause of dehiscence is drying. We can open or\r\nshut a fruit by drying or wetting it. The internal causes are related to\r\nthe arrangement of the tissues, and we may say that the opening of fruit\r\ncan be easily explained by the contraction of the ligneous fibers under\r\ndrying influences. M. Leclerc shows by experiment that the fibers\r\ncontract more transversely than longitudinally, and that the thicker\r\nfibers contract the most. This he finds is connected with the opening of\r\ndry fruits.\r\n\r\nHerr Hoffman has recently made some interesting experiments upon the\r\ncultivation of fruits.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that many plants appear to select certain mineral soils\r\nand avoid others, that a number of plants which prefer calcareous soils\r\nare grouped together as _calcicoles_, and others which shun such ground\r\nas _calcifuges_. Herr Hoffman has grown the specimen which has been\r\ncited by many authors as absolutely calcifugic. He has obtained strong\r\nplants upon a soil with 53 per cent. of lime, and these have withstood\r\nthe severe winter of 1879-1880, while individuals of the same species\r\ngrown on silicious ground have failed. This will modify the ideas of\r\nagriculturists, at least in regard to this plant.\r\n\r\nHerr Schwarz has been engaged in the study of the fine hairs of roots.\r\nAccording to this author, there is a maximum and minimum of humidity,\r\nbetween which there lies a mean of moisture, most favorable for the\r\ndevelopment of these capillary rootlets, and this amount of moisture\r\nvaries with different plants. He finds that this growth of hair-like\r\nroots is conditioned upon the development of the main root from which it\r\nsprings. In a weak solution of brine these fine roots are suppressed,\r\nwhile the growth of the main root is continued. The changes of the\r\n_milieu_ lead to changes in the form of the hairs, rendering them even\r\nbranched.\r\n\r\nSignor Savastano has ventured to criticise as exaggerated the views of\r\nMuller, Lubbock, and Allen on the adaptation of flowers to insects,\r\nhaving noticed that bees visit numbers of flowers, and extract their\r\nhoney without touching the stigmas or pistils. He has also found them\r\nneglecting flowers which were rich in honey and visiting others much\r\npoorer. These observations have value, but cannot be considered as\r\nseriously impairing the multiplied evidences of plant adaptation to\r\ninsect life.\r\n\r\nMr. Camus has shown that the flora of a small group of hills, the\r\nEuganean Mountains, west of the Apennines and south of the Alps, has a\r\npeculiar flora, forming an island in the midst of a contrasted flora\r\nexisting about it. Here are found Alpine, maritime, and exotic plants\r\nassociated in a common isolation.--_Revue Scientifique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT BOTANICAL ADVANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most significant of the recent discoveries in botany, is that\r\nrespecting the continuity of the protoplasm from cell to cell, by means\r\nof delicate threads which traverse channels through the cell walls. It\r\nhad long been known, that in the \"sieve\" tissues of higher plants there\r\nwas such continuity through the \"sieve plates,\" which imperfectly\r\nseparated the contiguous cells. This may be readily seen by making\r\nlongitudinal sections of a fibro-vascular bundle of a pumpkin stem,\r\nstaining with iodine, and contracting the protoplasm by alcohol.\r\nCarefully made specimens of the soft tissues of many plants have shown\r\na similar protoplasmic continuity, where it had previously been\r\nunsuspected. Some investigators are now inclined to the opinion that\r\nprotoplasmic continuity may be of universal occurrence in plants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LAUNCHES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A recent lecture before the Society of ATM, London.]\r\n\r\nBy A. RECKENZAUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to treat this subject from a shipwright's point\r\nof view. The title of this paper is supposed to indicate a mode of\r\npropelling boats by means of electrical energy, and it is to this motive\r\npower that I shall have the honor of drawing your attention.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of a launch, in the modern sense of the word, lies\r\nin the conveyance of passengers on rivers and lakes, less than for the\r\ntransport of heavy goods; therefore, it may not be out of place to\r\nconsider the conveniences arising from the employment of a motive power\r\nwhich promises to become valuable as time and experience advance. In a\r\nrecent paper before the British Association at Southport, I referred to\r\nnumerous experiments made with electric launches; now it is proposed\r\nto treat this subject in a wider sense, touching upon the points of\r\nconvenience in the first place; secondly, upon the cost and method of\r\nproducing the current of electricity; and thirdly, upon the construction\r\nand efficiency of the propelling power and its accessories.\r\n\r\nWhether it is for business, pleasure, or war purposes a launch should\r\nbe in readiness at all times, without requiring much preparation or\r\nattention. The distances to be traversed are seldom very great, fifty to\r\nsixty miles being the average.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole space of a launch should be available for the\r\naccommodation of passengers, and this is the case with an electrically\r\npropelled launch. We have it on good authority, that an electric launch\r\nwill accommodate nearly double the number of passengers that a\r\nsteam launch of the same dimensions would; therefore, for any given\r\naccommodation we should require a much smaller vessel, demanding less\r\npower to propel it at a given rate of speed, costing less, and affording\r\neasier management.\r\n\r\nA further convenience arising from electromotive power is the absence of\r\ncombustibles and the absence of the products of combustion-matters of\r\ngreat importance; and for the milder seasons, when inland navigation\r\nis principally enjoyed, the absence of heat, smell, and noise, and,\r\nfinally, the dispensing with one attendant on board, whose wages, in\r\nmost cases, amount to as much or more than the cost of fuel, besides the\r\ninconvenience of carrying an additional individual.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the cost of motive power is a serious\r\nconsideration with proprietors of launches, but it is evident that if\r\nthere be a choice between two methods of equal qualities, the most\r\neconomical method will gain favor. The motive power on the electric\r\nlaunch is the electric current; we must decide upon the mode of\r\nprocuring the current. The mode which first suggested itself to\r\nProfessor Jacobi, in the year 1838, was the primary battery, or the\r\npurely chemical process of generating electricity.\r\n\r\nJacobi employed, in the first instance, a Daniell's battery, and in\r\nlater experiments with his boat on the river Neva, a Grove's battery.\r\nThe Daniell's battery consisted of 320 cells containing plates of copper\r\nand zinc; the speed attained by the boat with this battery did not reach\r\none mile and a quarter per hour; when 64 Grove cells were substituted,\r\nthe speed came to two and a quarter miles per hour; the boat was 38\r\nfeet long. 7½ beam, and 3 feet deep. The electromotor was invented by\r\nProfessor Jacobi; it virtually consisted of two disks, one of which was\r\nstationary, and carried a number of electromagnets, while the other disk\r\nwas provided with pieces of iron serving as armatures to the pole pieces\r\nof the electromagnets, which were attracted while the electric current\r\nwas alternately conveyed through the bobbins by means of a commutator,\r\nproducing continuous rotation.\r\n\r\nWe are not informed as to the length of time the batteries were enabled\r\nto supply the motor with sufficient current, but we may infer from the\r\nsurface of the acting materials in the battery that the run was rather\r\nshort; the power of the motor was evidently very small, judging by the\r\nlimited speed obtained, but the originality of Jacobi deserves comment,\r\nand for this, as well as for numerous other researches, his name will be\r\nremembered at all times.\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that an electric launch was tried for\r\nexperimental purposes, on a lake at Pentlegaer, near Swansea. Mr. Robert\r\nHunt, in the discussion of his paper on electromagnetism before the\r\nInstitution of Civil Engineers in 1858, mentioned that he carried on an\r\nextended series of experiments at Falmouth, and at the instigation of\r\nBenkhausen, Russian Consul-General, he communicated with Jacobi upon the\r\nsubject. In the year 1848, at a meeting of the British Association at\r\nSwansea, Mr. Hunt was applied to, by some gentlemen connected with the\r\ncopper trade of that part, to make some experiments on the electrical\r\npropulsion of vessels; they stated, that although electricity might\r\ncost thirty times as much as the power obtained from coal it would,\r\nnevertheless, be sufficiently economical to induce its employment for\r\nthe auxiliary screw ships employed in the copper trade with South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe boat at Swansea was partly made under Mr. (now Sir William) Grove's\r\ndirections, and the engine was worked on the principle of the old toys\r\nof Ritchie, which consisted of six radiating poles projecting from a\r\nspindle, and rotating between a large electro-magnet. Three persons\r\ntraveled in Hunt's boat, at the rate of three miles per hour. Eight\r\nlarge Grove's cells were employed, but the expense put it out of\r\nquestion as a practical application.\r\n\r\nHad the Gramme or Siemens machine existed at that time, no doubt the\r\nsubject would have been further advanced, for it was not merely the cost\r\nof the battery which stood in the way, but the inefficient motor, which\r\nreturned only a small fraction of the power furnished by the zinc.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silvanus Thompson informs us that an electric boat was\r\nconstructed by Mr. G. E. Dering, in the year 1856, at Messrs. Searle's\r\nyard, on the River Thames; it was worked by a motor in which rotation\r\nwas effected by magnets arranged within coils, like galvanometer\r\nneedles, and acted on successively by currents from a battery.\r\n\r\nFrom a recent number of the _Annales de l'Electricite_, we learn that\r\nCount de Moulins experimented on the lake in the Bois de Boulogne, in\r\nthe year 1866, with an iron flat-bottomed boat, carrying twelve persons.\r\nTwenty Bunsen cells furnished the current to a motor on Froment's\r\nprinciple turning a pair of paddle wheels.\r\n\r\nIn all these reports there is a lack of data. We are interested to\r\nknow what power the motors developed, the time and speed, as well as\r\ndimensions and weights.\r\n\r\nUntil Trouve's trip on the Seine, in 1881, and the launch of the\r\nElectricity on the Thames, in 1882, very little was known concerning the\r\nhistory of electric navigation.\r\n\r\nM. Trouve originally employed Plante's secondary battery, but afterward\r\nreverted to a bichromate battery of his own invention. In all the\r\nprimary batteries hitherto applied with advantage, zinc has been used as\r\nthe acting material. Where much power is required, the consumption of\r\nzinc amounts to a formidable item; it costs, in quantity, about 3d. per\r\npound, and in a well arranged battery a definite quantity of zinc is\r\ntransformed. The final effect of this transformation manifests itself in\r\nelectrical energy, amounting to about 746 watts, or one electrical horse\r\npower for every two pounds of this metal consumed per hour. The cost of\r\nthe exciting fluid varies, however, considerably; it may be a solution\r\nof salts, or it may be dilute acid. Considering the zinc by itself, the\r\nexpense for five electrical or four mechanical horse power through an\r\nefficient motor, in a small launch, would be 2s. 6d. per hour. Many\r\npersons would willingly sacrifice 2s. 6d per hour for the convenience,\r\nbut a great item connected with the employment of zinc batteries is\r\nin the exciting fluid, and the trouble of preparing the zinc plates\r\nfrequently. The process of cleaning, amalgamating and refilling is so\r\ntedious, that the use of primary batteries for locomotive purposes is\r\nextremely limited. To recharge a Bunsen, Grove, or bichromate battery,\r\ncapable of giving six or seven hours' work at the rate of five\r\nelectrical horse power, would involve a good day's work for one man; no\r\ndoubt he would consider himself entitled to a full day's wages, with the\r\nbest appliances to assist him in the operation.\r\n\r\nSeveral improved primary batteries have recently been brought out, which\r\npromise economical results. If the residual compound of zinc can be\r\nutilized, and sold at a good price, then the cost of such motive power\r\nmay be reduced in proportion to the value of those by-products.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of comparison, let us now employ the man who would\r\notherwise clean and prepare the primary cells, at engine driving. We let\r\nhim attend to a six horse power steam engine, boiler, and dynamo machine\r\nfor charging 50 accumulators, each of a capacity of 370 ampere hours, or\r\none horse power hour. The consumption of fuel will probably amount to 40\r\nlb. per hour, which, at the rate of 18s. a ton, will give an expenditure\r\nof nearly 4d. per hour. The energy derived from coal in the accumulator\r\ncosts, in the case of a supply of five electrical horse power for seven\r\nhours, 2s. 9d.; the energy derived from the zinc in a primary battery,\r\nsupplying five electrical horse power for seven hours, would cost 17s.\r\n3d.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly probable that any one would lay down a complete plant,\r\nconsisting of a steam or gas engine and dynamo, for the sole purpose of\r\ncharging the boat cells, unless such a boat were in almost daily use, or\r\nunless several boats were to be supplied with electrical power from one\r\nstation. In order that electric launches may prove useful, it will be\r\ndesirable that charging stations should be established, and on many of\r\nthe British and Irish rivers and lakes there is abundance of motive\r\npower, in the shape of steam or gas engines, or water-wheels.\r\n\r\nA system of hiring accumulators ready for use may, perhaps, best satisfy\r\nthe conditions imposed in the case of pleasure launches.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to compile comparative tables showing the relative\r\nexpenses for running steam launches, electric launches with secondary\r\nbatteries, and electric launches with primary zinc batteries; but I\r\nhave roughly calculated that, for a launch having accommodation for a\r\ndefinite number of passengers, the total costs are as 1, 2.5, and 12\r\nrespectively, steam being lowest and zinc batteries highest.\r\n\r\nThe accumulators are, in this case, charged by a small high pressure\r\nsteam engine, and a very large margin for depreciation and interest on\r\nplant is added. The launch taken for this comparison must run during\r\n2,000 hours in the year, and be principally employed in a regular\r\npassenger service, police and harbor duties, postal service on the lakes\r\nand rivers of foreign countries, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe subject of secondary batteries has been so ably treated by Professor\r\nSilvanus Thompson and Dr. Oliver Lodge, in this room, that I should\r\nvainly attempt to give you a more complete idea of their nature. The\r\nimprovements which are being made from time to time mostly concern\r\nmechanical details, and although important, a description will scarcely\r\nprove interesting.\r\n\r\nA complete Faure-Sellon-Volckmar cell, such as is used in the existing\r\nelectric launches, is here on the table; this box weighs, when ready\r\nfor use, 56 lb.; and it stores energy equal to one horse power for one\r\nhour=1,980,000 foot pounds, or about one horse power per minute for each\r\npound weight of material. It is not advantageous to withdraw the whole\r\namount of energy put in; although its charging capacity is as much as\r\n370 ampere hours, we do not use more than 80 per cent., or 300 ampere\r\nhours; hence, if we discharge these accumulators at the rate of 40\r\namperes, we obtain an almost constant current for 7½ hours: one cell\r\ngives an E.M.F. of two volts. In order to have a constant power of one\r\nhorse for 7½ hours, at the rate of 40 amperes discharge, we must have\r\nmore than nine cells per electrical horsepower; and 47 such cells will\r\nsupply five electrical horse power for the time stated, and these 47\r\ncells will weigh 2,633 lb.\r\n\r\nWe could employ half the number of cells by using them at the rate of\r\n80 amperes, but then they will supply the power for less than half the\r\ntime. The fact, however, that the cells will give so high a rate of\r\ndischarge for a few hours is, in itself, important, since we are enabled\r\nto apply great power if desirable; the 47 cells above referred to can\r\nbe made to give 10 or 12 electrical horse power for over two hours, and\r\nthus propel the boat at a very high speed, provided that the motor is\r\nadapted to utilize such powerful currents.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned weight of battery power--viz., 2,632 lb., to\r\nwhich has to be added the weight of the motor and the various\r\nfittings--represents, in the case of a steam launch, the weight of\r\ncoals, steam boiler, engine, and fittings. The electro motor capable of\r\ngiving four horse power on the screw shaft need not weigh 400 lb. if\r\neconomically designed; this added to the weight of the accumulators, and\r\nallowing a margin for switches and leads, brings the whole apparatus up\r\nto about 28 cwt.\r\n\r\nAn equally powerful launch engine and boiler, together with a maximum\r\nstowage of fuel, will weigh about the same. There is, however, this\r\ndisadvantage about the steam power, that it occupies the most valuable\r\npart of the vessel, taking away some eight or nine feet of the widest\r\nand most convenient part, and in a launch of twenty-four feet length,\r\nrequiring such a power as we have been discussing, this is actually\r\none-third of the total length of the vessel, and one-half of the\r\npassenger accommodation; therefore, I may safely assert that an electric\r\nlaunch will carry about twice as many people as a steam launch of\r\nsimilar dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe diagram on the wall represents sections of an electric launch built\r\nby Messrs. Yarrow and Company, and fitted up by the Electrical Power\r\nStorage Company, for the recent Electrical Exhibition in Vienna. She has\r\nmade a great number of successful voyages on the River Danube during the\r\nautumn. Her hull is of steel, 40 feet long and 6 feet beam, and there\r\nare seats to accommodate forty adults comfortably. Her accumulators are\r\nstowed away under the floor, so is the motor, but owing to the lines of\r\nthe boat the floor just above the motor is raised a few inches. This\r\nmotor is a Siemens D2 machine, capable of working up to seven horse\r\npower with eighty accumulators.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the horse power of an electro motor, I always mean the\r\nactual power developed in the shaft, and not the electrical horse power;\r\nthis, therefore, should not be compared to the indicated horse power of\r\na steam engine.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Messrs. Yarrow for the principal dimensions and other\r\nparticulars of a high pressure launch engine and boiler, such as would\r\nbe suitable for this boat. From these dimensions I prepared a second\r\ndiagram representing the steam power, and when placed in position it\r\nwill show at a glance how much space this apparatus will occupy. The\r\ntotal length lost in this way amounts to 12 feet, leaving for testing\r\ncapacity only 15 feet, while that of the electric launch is 27 feet\r\non each side of the boat; thus the accommodation is as fifteen to\r\ntwenty-seven, or as twenty-two passengers to forty, in favor of the\r\nelectric launch.\r\n\r\nComparing the relative weights of the steam power and the electric power\r\nfor this launch, we find that they are nearly equal--each approaches 50\r\ncwt; but in the case of the steam launch we include 10 cwt. of coals,\r\nwhich can be stowed into the bunkers, and which allow fifteen hours\r\ncontinuous steaming, whereas the electric energy stored up will only\r\ngive us seven and a half hours with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nI have here allowed 8 lb. of coal per indicated horse power per hour,\r\nand 10 horse power giving off 7 mechanical horse power on the screw\r\nshaft; this is an example of an average launch engine. There are launch\r\nengines in existence which do not consume one-half that amount of fuel,\r\nbut these are so few, so rare, and so expensive, that I have neglected\r\nthem in this account.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago, a steam launch carrying a seven hours supply of fuel\r\nwas considered marvelous.\r\n\r\nOur present accumulaton supplies 33,000 foot pounds of work per pound of\r\nlead, but theoretically one pound of lead manifests an energy equal to\r\n360,000 foot pounds in the separation from its oxide; and in the case of\r\niron, Prof. Osborne Reynolds told us in this place, the energy evolved\r\nby its oxidation is equivalent to 1,900,000 foot pounds per pound of\r\nmetal. How nearly these limits may be approached will he the problem\r\nof the chemist; to prophesy is dangerous, while science and its\r\napplications are advancing at this rapid rate.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, then, with our weight of fully oxidized lead we should be\r\nable to travel for 82 hours; with the same weight of iron for 430 hours,\r\nor 18 days and nights continually, at the rate of 8 miles per hour, with\r\none change. Of course, these feats are quite impossible. We might as\r\nwell dream of getting 5 horse power out of a steam engine for one pound\r\nof coal per hour.\r\n\r\nWhile the chemist is busy with his researches for substances and\r\ncombinations which will yield great power with small quantities of\r\nmaterial, the engineer assiduously endeavors to reconvert the chemical\r\nor electrical energy into mechanical work suitable to the various needs.\r\n\r\nTo get the maximum amount of work with a minimum amount of weight, and\r\nleast dimensions combined with the necessary strength is the province\r\nof the mechanical engineer--it is a grand and interesting study; it\r\ninvolves many factors; it is not, as in the steam engine and hydraulic\r\nmachine, a matter of pressures, tension and compression, centrifugal and\r\nstatic forces, but it comprises a still larger number of factors, all\r\nbearing a definite relation to each other.\r\n\r\nWith dynamo machines the aim has been to obtain as nearly as possible\r\nas much electrical energy out of the machine as has been put in by the\r\nprime mover, irrespective of the quantity of material employed in its\r\nconstruction. Dr. J. Hopkinson has not only improved upon the Edison\r\ndynamo, and obtained 94 per cent. of the power applied in the form of\r\nelectrical energy, but he got 50 horse power out of the same quantity of\r\niron and copper where Edison could only get 20 horsepower--and, though\r\nthe efficiency of this generator is perfect, it could not be called an\r\nefficient motor, suitable for locomotion by land or water, because it\r\nis still too heavy. An efficient motor for locomotion purposes must not\r\nonly give out in mechanical work as nearly as possible as much as the\r\nelectrical energy put in, but it must be of small weight, because it has\r\nto propel itself along with the vehicle, and every pound weight of\r\nthe motor represents so many foot pounds of energy used in its own\r\npropulsion; thus, if a motor weighed 660 pounds, and were traveling at\r\nthe rate of 50 feet per minute, against gravitation, it would expend\r\n33,000 foot pounds per minute in moving itself, and although this\r\nmachine may give 2 horse power, with an efficiency of 90 per cent.\r\nit would, in the case of a boat or a tram-car, be termed a wasteful\r\nmachine. Here we have an all-important factor which can be neglected,\r\nto a certain extent, in the dynamo as a generator, although from an\r\neconomical point of view excessive weight in the dynamo must also be\r\ncarefully avoided.\r\n\r\nThe proper test for an electro-motor, therefore, is not merely its\r\nefficiency, or the quotient of the mechanical power given out, divided\r\nby the electrical energy put in, but also the number of feet it could\r\nraise its own weight in a given space of time, with a given current, or,\r\nin other words, the number of foot pounds of work each pound weight of\r\nthe motor would give out.\r\n\r\nThe Siemens D2 machine, as used in the launch shown in the diagram on\r\nthe wall, is one of the lightest and best motors, it gives 7 horse power\r\non the shaft, with an expenditure of 9 electrical horsepower, and it\r\nweighs 658 lb.; its efficiency, therefore, 7/5 or nearly 78 per cent.;\r\nbut its \"coefficient\" as an engine of locomotion is 351--that is to say,\r\neach pound weight of the motor will yield 351 foot pounds on the shaft.\r\nWe could get even more than 7 horse power out of this machine, by either\r\nrunning it at an excessive speed, or by using excessive currents; in\r\nboth cases, however, we should shorten the life of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nAn electro-motor consists, generally, of two or more electro-magnets so\r\narranged that they continually attract each other, and thereby convey\r\npower. As already stated, there are numerous factors, all bearing a\r\ncertain relationship to each other, and particular rules which hold\r\ngood in one type of machine will not always answer in another, but the\r\ngeneral laws of electricity and magnetism must be observed in all cases.\r\nWith a given energy expressed in watts, we can arrange a quantity of\r\nwire and iron to produce a certain quantity of work; the smaller the\r\nquantity of material employed, and the larger the return for the energy\r\nput in, the greater is the total efficiency of the machine.\r\n\r\nPowerful electro-magnets, judiciously arranged, must make powerful\r\nmotors. The ease with which powerful electro-magnets can be constructed\r\nhas led many to believe that the power of an electro-motor can be\r\nincreased almost infinitely, without a corresponding increase of energy\r\nspent. The strongest magnet can be produced with an exceedingly\r\nsmall current, if we only wind sufficient wire upon an iron core. An\r\nelectro-magnet excited by a tiny battery of 10 volts, and, say,\r\none ampere of current, may be able to hold a tremendous weight in\r\nsuspension, although the energy consumed amounts to only 10 watts, or\r\nless than 1/75 of a horse power, but the suspended weight produces no\r\nmechanical work. Mechanical work would only be done if we discontinued\r\nthe flow of the current, in which case the said weight would drop; if\r\nthe distance is sufficiently small, the magnet could, by the application\r\nof the current from the battery, raise the weight again, and if that\r\noperation is repeated many times in a minute, then we could determine\r\nthe mechanical work performed. Assuming that the weight raised is 1,000\r\nlb., and that we could make and break the current two hundred times\r\na minute, then the work done by the falling mass could, under no\r\ncircumstances, equal 1/75 of a horse-power, or 440 foot-pounds; that is,\r\n1,000 lb. lifted 2.27 feet high in a minute, or about one-eighth of an\r\ninch for each operation: hence the mere statical pull, or power of the\r\nmagnet, does in no way tend to increase the energy furnished by the\r\nbattery or generator, for the instant we wish to do work we must have\r\nmotion--work being the product of mass and distance.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money have virtually been thrown away in the endeavor\r\nto produce energy, and there are intelligent persons who to this day\r\nimagine that, by indefinitely increasing the strength of a magnet, more\r\npower may be got out of it than is put in.\r\n\r\nLarge field-magnets are advantageous, and the tendency in the\r\nmanufacture of dynamo machines has been to increase the mass of iron,\r\nbecause with long and heavy cores and pole pieces there is a steady\r\nmagnetism insured, and therefore a steady current, since large masses\r\nof iron take a long time to magnetize and demagnetize; thus very slight\r\nirregularites in the speed of an armature are not so easily perceived.\r\nIn the case of electro-motors these conditions are changed. In the first\r\nplace, we assume that the current put through the coils of the magnets\r\nis continuous; and secondly, we can count upon the momentum of the\r\narmature, as well as the momentum of the driven object, to assist us\r\nover slight irregularities. With electric launches we are bound\r\nto employ a battery current, and battery currents are perfectly\r\ncontinuous--there are no sudden changes; it is consequently a question\r\nas to how small a mass of iron we may employ in our dynamo as a motor\r\nwithout sacrificing efficiency. The intensity of the magnetic field\r\nmust be got by saturating the iron, and the energy being fixed, this\r\nsaturation determines the limit of the weight of the iron. Soft wrought\r\niron, divided into the largest possible number of pieces, will serve\r\nour purpose best. The question of strength of materials plays also an\r\nimportant part. We cannot reduce the quantity and division to such a\r\npoint that the rigidity and equilibrium of the whole structure is in any\r\nway endangered.\r\n\r\nThe armature, for instance, must not give way to the centrifugal forces\r\nimposed upon it, nor should the field magnets be so flexible as to yield\r\nto the statical pull of the magnetic poles. The compass of this paper\r\ndoes not permit of a detailed discussion of the essential points to be\r\nobserved in the construction of electro-motors; a reference to the main\r\npoints, may, however, be useful. The designer has, first of all, to\r\ndetermine the most effective positions of the purely electrical and\r\nmagnetic parts; secondly, compactness and simplicity in details;\r\nthirdly, easy access to such parts as are subject to wear and\r\nadjustment; and, fourthly, the cost of materials and labor. The internal\r\nresistance of the motor should be proportioned to the resistances of the\r\ngenerator and the conductors leading from the generator to the receiver.\r\n\r\nThe insulation resistances must be as high as possible; the insulation\r\ncan never be too good. The motor should he made to run at that speed\r\nat which it gives the greatest power with a high efficiency, without\r\nheating to a degree which would damage the insulating material.\r\n\r\nBefore fixing a motor in its final position, it should also be tested\r\nfor power with a dynamometer, and for this purpose a Prony brake answers\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nAn ammeter inserted in the circuit will show at a glance what current is\r\npassing at any particular speed, and voltmeter readings are taken at the\r\nterminals of the machine, when the same is standing still as well as\r\nwhen the armature is running, because the E.M.F. indicated when the\r\narmature is at rest alone determines the commercial efficiency of the\r\nmotor, whereas the E M.F. developed during motion varies with the speed\r\nuntil it nearly reaches the E.M.F. in the leads; at that point the\r\ntheoretical efficiency will be highest.\r\n\r\nCalculations are greatly facilitated, and the value of tests can be\r\nascertained quickly, if the constant of the brake is ascertained; then\r\nit will be simply necessary to multiply the number of revolutions and\r\nthe weight at the end of the lever by such a constant, and the product\r\ngives the horse power, because, with a given Prony brake, the only\r\nvariable quantities are the weight and the speed. All the observations,\r\nelectrical and mechanical, are made simultaneously. The electrical horse\r\npower put into the motor is found by the well known formula C x E / 746;\r\nthis simple multiplication and division becomes very tedious and even\r\nlaborious if many tests have to be made in quick succession, and to\r\nobviate this trouble, and prevent errors, I have constructed a horse\r\npower diagram, the principle of which is shown in the diagram (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nGraphic representations are of the greatest value in all comparative\r\ntests. Mr. Gisbert Kapp has recently published a useful curve in the\r\n_Electrician_, by means of which one can easily compare the power and\r\nefficiency at a glance (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nThe speeds are plotted as abscissae, and the electrical work absorbed\r\nin watts divided by 746 as ordinates; then with a series-wound motor we\r\nobtain the curve, EE. The shape of this curve depends on the type of\r\nthe motor. Variation of speed is obtained by loading the brake with\r\ndifferent weights. We begin with an excess of weight which holds the\r\nmotor fast, and then a maximum current will flow through it without\r\nproducing any external work. When we remove the brake altogether, the\r\nmotor will run with a maximum speed, and again produce no external work,\r\nbut in this case very little current will pass; this maximum speed is om\r\non the diagram. Between these two extremes external work will be done,\r\nand there is a speed at which this is a maximum. To find these speeds we\r\nload the brake to different weights, and plot the resulting speeds and\r\nhorse powers as abscissae and ordinates producing the curve, BB. Another\r\ncurve,\r\n\r\ne = B/E\r\n\r\nmade with an arbitrary scale, gives the commercial efficiency; the speed\r\nfor a maximum external horse power is o a, and the speed for the highest\r\nefficiency is represented by o b. In practice it is not necessary to\r\ntest a motor to the whole limits of this diagram; it will be sufficient\r\nto commence with a speed at which the efficiency becomes appreciable,\r\nand to leave off with that speed which renders the desired power.\r\n\r\nI have now to draw your attention to a new motor of my own invention, of\r\nthe weight of 124 lb., which, at 1,550 revolutions, gives 31 amperes and\r\n61.5 volts at terminals. The mechanical horse power is 1.37, and the\r\ncoefficient 373.\r\n\r\n                                                     Ohms.\r\nArmature resistance                                    0.4 w.\r\nField-magnet resistance                               0.17 w.\r\nInsulation resistance                            1,500,000 w.\r\n\r\nThis motor was only completed on the morning before reading the paper;\r\nit could not, therefore, be tested as to its various capacities.\r\n\r\nWe have next to consider the principle of applying the motive power to\r\nthe propulsion of a launch. The propellers hitherto practically applied\r\nin steam navigation are the paddle-wheel and the screw. The experience\r\nof modern steam navigation points to the exclusive use and advantage of\r\nthe screw propeller where great speed of shaft is obtainable, and the\r\nelectric engine is pre-eminently a high-speed engine, consequently the\r\nscrew appears to be most suitable to the requirements of electric boats.\r\nBy simply fixing the propeller to the prolonged motor shaft, we complete\r\nthe whole system, which, when correctly made, will do its duty in\r\nperfect order, with an efficiency approaching theory to a high degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--RECKENZAUN'S ELECTRICAL HORSE POWER DIAGRAM.\r\n\r\nDraw a square, A B C D--divide B C into 746 parts, and C D into 1,000\r\nparts, or, generally, let a division on C D be 0.746 of a division on B\r\nC, so that we can use the horizontal lines cutting A B as a horse power\r\nscale. A B, in the above diagram, gives 1,000 horse power, if the line\r\nB C represents 746 volts, and C D 1,000 amperes. Let x = any number of\r\nvolts, y the amperes, and h the horse power, then\r\n\r\nh/x = y/100 :. h = xy/746\r\n\r\nA fine wire or thread stretched from o as a center to the required\r\ndivision on C D will facilitate references.]\r\n\r\nWhatever force may be imparted to the water by a propeller, such force\r\ncan be resolved into two elements, one of which is parallel, and the\r\nother in a plane at right angles to the keel. The parallel force alone\r\nhas the propelling effect; the screw, therefore, should always be so\r\nconstructed that its surfaces shall be chiefly employed in driving the\r\nwater in a direction parallel to the keel from stem to stern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2--KAPP'S DIAGRAM.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a finely pitched screw, running at a high velocity,\r\nwill supply these conditions best. With that beautiful screw lying on\r\nthis table, and made by Messrs. Yarrow, 95 per cent. of efficiency\r\nhas been obtained when running at a speed of over 800 revolutions per\r\nminute--that is to say, only 5 per cent was lost in slip.\r\n\r\nReviewing the various points of advantage, it appears that electricity\r\nwill, in time to come, be largely used for propelling launches, and,\r\nperhaps, something more than launches.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, quoting Dr. Lardner's remarks on the subject of steam\r\nnavigation of nearly fifty years ago, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Some, who, being conversant with the actual conditions of steam\r\nengineering as applied to navigation, and aware of various commercial\r\nconditions which must affect the problem, were enabled to estimate\r\ncalmly and dispassionately the difficulties and drawbacks, as well as\r\nthe disadvantages, of the undertaking, entertained doubts which clouded\r\nthe brightness of their hopes, and warned the commercial world against\r\nthe indulgence of too sanguine anticipation of the immediate and\r\nunqualified realization of the project. They counseled caution and\r\nreserve against an improvident investment of extensive capital in\r\nschemes which still be only regarded as experimental, and which might\r\nprove its grave. But the voice of remonstrance was drowned amid the\r\nenthusiasm excited by the promise of an immediate practical realization\r\nof a scheme so grand.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot,\" he continues, \"be seriously imagined that any one who\r\nhad been conversant with the past history of steam navigation could\r\nentertain the least doubt of the abstract practicability of a steam\r\nvessel making the voyage between Bristol and New York. A steam vessel,\r\nhaving as cargo a couple of hundred tons of coals, would, _cæteris\r\nparibus_, be as capable of crossing the Atlantic as a vessel\r\ntransporting the same weight of any other cargo.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lardner is generally credited with having asserted that a steam\r\nvoyage across the Atlantic was \"a physical impossibility,\" but in the\r\nwork from which I took the liberty of copying his words he denies the\r\ncharge, and says that what he did affirm was, that long sea voyages\r\ncould not at that time be maintained with that regularity and certainty\r\nwhich are indispensable to commercial success, by any revenue which\r\ncould be expected from traffic alone.\r\n\r\nThe practical results are well known to us. History repeats itself, and\r\nthe next generation may put on record our week attempts, our doubts and\r\nfears of this day. Whether electricity will ever rival steam, remains\r\nyet to be proved; we may be on the threshold of great things. The\r\npremature enthusiasm has subsided, and we enter upon the road of steady\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nMr. Wm. H. Preece, the chairman, in inviting discussion, said that no\r\ndoubt those present would like to know something about the cost of such\r\na boat as Mr. Reckenzaun described, and he hoped that gentleman would\r\ngive them some information on that point.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Selwyn thought Mr. Reckenzaun was a little below the mark when\r\nhe talked about the dream of getting 5 horse power for one pound--he\r\nwould not say of coal, but of fuel. For some months he had seen ½ lb. of\r\nfuel produce 1 horse power, and he knew it could be done. That fuel was\r\ncondensed concentrated fuel in the shape of oil. When this could be\r\ndone, electrical energy also could be obtained much cheaper, but if it\r\nwere extended to yachts, he thought that would be as far as any one now\r\npresent could be expected to see it go. Still he thought there was a\r\nfuture for it, and that future would be best advanced by considering the\r\nquestion on which he had touched. First, the employment of a cheaper\r\nmode of getting the power in the steam engine; and, secondly, a cheaper\r\nand higher secondary battery. In a railway train weight was a formidable\r\naffair, but in a floating vessel it was still more important. He did\r\nnot think, however, that a light secondary battery was by any means an\r\nimpossibility. Mr. Loftus Perkins had actually produced by improvements\r\nin the boiler and steam engine two great things: first, one indicated\r\nhorse power for a pound of fuel per hour, and next he had devised a\r\nsteam engine of 100 horse power, of a weight of only 84 lb. per horse\r\npower, instead of 304 lb., which was about the average. Those were two\r\nenormous steps in advance, and under a still more improved patent law he\r\nhad no doubt things would be brought forward which would show a still\r\ngreater progress. Within the last fifteen days, nearly 2,000 patents\r\nhad been taken out, as against 5,000 in the whole of the previous year,\r\nwhich showed how operative a very small and illusory inducement had been\r\nto encourage invention. He had long been known as an advocate of patent\r\nlaw reform, and, therefore, felt bound to lose no opportunity of calling\r\nattention to its importance. Invention was in the hands of the inventor,\r\nthe creator of trade. If, without robbing anybody, one wished to produce\r\nproperty, it must be done by improving manufactures as a consequence\r\nof inventions. In one instance alone it bad been proved that a single\r\ninvention had been the means of introducing twenty millions annually,\r\nupon which income tax was paid.\r\n\r\nMr. Crampton said he did not think steam could ever compete with\r\nelectricity, under certain circumstances; but, at the same time, it\r\nwould be a long time before it was superseded. He should like very much\r\nto see the compressed oil, one-sixth of a pound of which would give 1\r\nhorse power per hour.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Selwyn said he had seen a common Cornish boiler doing it years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nMr. Crampton said it had never come under his notice, and he had no\r\nhesitation in saying that no such duty ever was performed by any oil,\r\nbecause he never heard of any oil which evaporated more than eighteen to\r\ntwenty-two pounds of water per pound. However, he was delighted to hear\r\nof such progress being made, and though he had been for so many years\r\nconnected with steam, he never expected it would last forever. He was\r\nnow making experiments for some large shipowners, for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating feeding and doing away with dust, but let him succeed to\r\nwhat extent he might, steam would never compete with electricity for\r\nsuch small vessels as these launches.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman asked if he rightly understood Admiral Selwyn that he had\r\nrecently seen an invention in which one-sixth of a pound of condensed\r\nfuel would give 1 horse power per hour.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Selwyn said it was now some years ago since he saw this going\r\non, but the persons who did it did not know how or why it was done.\r\nHe had studied the question for the last ten years, and now knew the\r\n_rationale_ of it, and would be prepared shortly to publish it. He knew\r\nthat 22 was the theoretical calorific value of the pound of oil, and\r\nnever supposed that oil alone would give 46 lb., which he saw it doing.\r\nHe had found out that by means of the oil forming carbon constantly in\r\nthe furnace, the hydrogen of the steam was burned, and that it was a\r\nfallacy to suppose that an equal quantity of heat was used in raising\r\nsteam, at a pressure of, say, 120 lb. to the square inch, as the\r\nhydrogen was capable of developing when properly burned. There were,\r\nhowever, conditions under which alone that combustion could take\r\nplace--one being that the heat of the chamber must be 3,700°, and that\r\ncarbon must be constantly formed.\r\n\r\nMr. Gumpel said with regard to the general application of electricity to\r\nthe propulsion of vessels as well as to railway trains, he believed that\r\nmany of those present would live to see electricity applied to that\r\npurpose, because there were so many minds now applied to the problem,\r\nthat before long he had no doubt we should see coal burned in batteries,\r\nas it was now burned in steam boilers. The utmost they could do, then,\r\nwould be about 50 per cent. less than Admiral Selwyn said could be\r\naccomplished with condensed fuel. He could not but wonder where Admiral\r\nSelwyn obtained his information, knowing that a theoretically perfect\r\nheat engine would only give 23 per cent. of the absolute heat used,\r\nand that a pound of the best coal would give but 8,000 and hydrocarbon\r\n13,000 heat units, while hydrogen would give 34,000; and calculating it\r\nout, how was it possible to get out of one-sixth of a pound of carbon,\r\nor any hydrocarbon, the amount of power stated? No doubt, when Admiral\r\nSelwyn applied the knowledge which physicists would give him of the\r\namount of power which could be got out of a certain amount of carbon and\r\nhydrogen, he would find that there was a mistake somewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. Reckenzaun, in reply, said it would be very difficult to answer\r\nthe question put by the Chairman, as to the cost of an electric\r\nlaunch--quite as difficult as to say what would be the cost of a steam\r\nlaunch. It depended on the fittings, the ornamental part, the power\r\nrequired, and the time it was required to run. If such a launch were\r\nto run constantly, two sets of accumulators would be required, one to\r\nreplace the other when discharged. This could be easily done, the floor\r\nbeing made to take up, and the cells could be changed in a few minutes\r\nwith proper appliances. As to Admiral Selwyn's remarks about one-sixth\r\nof a pound of fuel per horse power, he had never heard of such a thing\r\nbefore, and should like to know more about it. Mr. Loftus Perkins'\r\nnew steam engine was a wonderful example of modern engineering. A\r\ncomparatively small engine, occupying no more space than that of a steam\r\nlaunch of considerable dimensions, developed 800 horse power indicated.\r\nFrom a mechanical point of view, this engine was extremely interesting;\r\nit had four cylinders, but only one crank and one connecting rod; and\r\nthere were no dead centers. The mechanism was very beautiful, but would\r\nrequire elaborate diagrams to explain. Mr. Perkins deserved the greatest\r\npraise for it, for in it he had reduced both the weight of the engine\r\nand the consumption of fuel to a minimum. He believed he used coke and\r\ntook one pound per horse power. He should not like to cross the Channel\r\nin the electric launch, if there was a heavy sea on, for shaking\r\ncertainly did not increase the efficiency of the accumulators, but a\r\nfair amount of motion they could stand, and they had run on the Thames,\r\nby the side of heavy tug boats causing a considerable amount of swell,\r\nwithout any mishap. Of course each box was provided with a lid, and the\r\nplates were so closely packed that a fair amount of shaking would not\r\naffect them; the only danger was the spilling of the acid. Mr. Crohne\r\nhad remarked that a torpedo boat of that size would have 100 indicated\r\nhorse power, but then the whole boat would be filled with machinery.\r\nWhat might be done with electricity they had, as yet, no idea of. At\r\npresent, they could only get 33,000 foot pounds from 1 lb. of lead and\r\nacid, though, theoretically, they ought to get 360,000 foot pounds. Iron\r\nin its oxidation would manifest theoretically 1,900,000 foot pounds\r\nper lb. of material. As yet they had not succeeded in making an iron\r\naccumulator; if they could, they would get about six or seven times\r\nthe energy for the same weight of material, or could reduce the\r\nweight proportionately for the same power, and in that way they might\r\neventually get 70 horse power in a boat of that size, because the weight\r\nof the motor was not great. With regard to the formation of a film on\r\nthe surface, no doubt a film of sulphate of lead was formed if the\r\nbattery stood idle, but it did not considerably reduce its efficiency;\r\nas soon as it was broke through by the energy being evolved from it, it\r\nwould give off its maximum current. They knew by experience that, with\r\nproperly constructed accumulators, 80 per cent. of the energy put into\r\nthem was returned in work. It was quite certain, as Mr. Crampton said,\r\nthat it would be a long time before steam was superseded: he did not\r\nprophesy at all; and he entitled his paper \"Electric Launches,\" because\r\nit would be presumptuous to speak of anything more until larger vessels\r\nhad been made and tried. With regard to Mr. Gumpel's remark on the\r\nfriction of the propeller, he would say that it was constructed to run\r\n900 revolutions; if it were driven by a steam engine, and the speed\r\nreduced to 300, not only would the pitch have to be altered, but the\r\nsurface would have to be larger, which would entail more friction. Mr.\r\nCrohne would bear him out that they lost only 5 per cent. by slip and\r\nfriction combined, on an average of a great number of trials, both with\r\nand against the current.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman in proposing a vote of thanks to Mr. Reckenzaun, said he\r\nrejoiced to find that that gentleman had proved, to one man at least,\r\nthat his views had been mistaken. He found in these days of the\r\npractical applications of electricity, that the ideas of most practical\r\nmen were gradually being proved to be mistaken, and every day new facts\r\nwere being discovered, which led them to imagine that as yet they were\r\nonly on the shore of an enormous ocean of knowledge. It was quite\r\nimpossible to say what these electric launches would lead to. Certain\r\npoints of great importance had been pointed out; they gave great room\r\nand they were always ready. For lifeboat and fire engine purposes, as\r\nCaptain Shaw pointed out at Vienna, this was of great consequence.\r\n\r\nAt first they were led to believe that there was great stability, but\r\nthat idea had been a little shaken, not as to the boat itself, but as\r\nto the influence of the motion of the water upon the constancy of the\r\ncells. But these boats were only intended for smooth water, and if\r\nthey could not be adapted for rough water, he feared Admiral Selwyn's\r\nsuggestion of the application of this principle to lifeboats would fall\r\nto the ground; but if secondary batteries were not calculated as yet\r\nto stand rough usage, it only required probably some thought on Mr.\r\nReckenzaun's part to make them available even in a gale. Enormous\r\nstrides were being made with regard to these batteries. No one present\r\nhad been a greater skeptic with regard to them at first than be himself;\r\nbut after constant experiments--employing them, as he had done for many\r\nmonths, for telegraphic purposes--he was gradually coming to view them\r\nwith a much more favorable eye. The same steps which had rendered all\r\nscientific notions practicable, had gradually eliminated the faults\r\nwhich originally existed, and they were now becoming good, sound,\r\navailable instruments. At present, he could only regard this electric\r\nlaunch as a luxury. He had hoped that Mr. Reckenzaun would have been\r\nable to say something which would have enabled poor men to look forward\r\nto the time when they might enjoy themselves in them on the river; but\r\nhe was told at Vienna, when he enjoyed two or three trips in this boat\r\non the Danube, that her cost would be about £800, which was a little too\r\nmuch for most people. They wanted something more within their reach,\r\nso that at various points on the river they might see small engines\r\nconstantly at work supplying energy to secondary batteries, and so that\r\nthey might start on a Friday evening, and go up as far as Oxford, or\r\nhigher, and come down again on Monday morning. He must congratulate Mr.\r\nReckenzaun on the excellent diagrams he had constructed. The trouble of\r\ncalculating figures of this sort was very great when making experiments;\r\nand the use of diagrams and curves expedited the labor very much. At\r\npresent they were passing through a stage of electrical depression;\r\nrobbery had been committed on a large scale; the earnings of the poor\r\nhad been filched out of their pockets by sanguine company promotors; an\r\nenormous amount of money had been lost, and the result had been that\r\nconfidence was, to a great extent, destroyed; but those who had been\r\nwise enough to keep their money in their pockets, and to read the papers\r\nread in that room, must have seen that there was a constant steady\r\nadvance in scientific knowledge of the laws of electricity and in their\r\npractical applications, and as soon as some of these rotten, mushroom\r\ncompanies had been wiped out of existence, they might hope that real\r\npractical progress would be made, and that the day was not far distant\r\nwhen the public would again acquire confidence in electrical enterprise.\r\nThey would then enable inventors and practical men to carry out their\r\nexperiments, and to put electrical matters on a proper footing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST EXPERIMENTS WITH THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectric lighting dates back, as well known; to the celebrated\r\nexperiment of Sir Humphry Davy, which took place in 1809 or 1810, but\r\nthe date of which is often given as 1813. There exist however, some\r\nindications that experiments on the production of the electric spark\r\nbetween carbons had been performed before the above named date.\r\n\r\nMr. S.P. Thompson has given the following interesting details in regard\r\nto this subject: In looking over an old volume of the _Journal de\r\nParis_, says he, I found under date of the 22d Ventose, year X.\r\n(March 12, 1802), the following passage, which evidently refers to an\r\nexhibition of the electric arc:\r\n\r\n\"Citizen Robertson, the inventor of the phantasmagoria (magic lantern),\r\nis at present performing some interesting experiments that must\r\ndoubtless advance our knowledge concerning galvanism. He has just\r\nmounted metallic piles to the number of 2,500 zinc plates and as many of\r\nrosette copper. We shall forthwith speak of his results, as well as of a\r\nnew experiment that he performed yesterday with two glowing carbons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HUMPHRY DAVY'S ELECTRIC LIGHT EXPERIMENTS IN 1813.]\r\n\r\n\"The first having been placed at the base of a column of 120 zinc and\r\nsilver elements, and the second communicating with the apex of the pile,\r\nthey gave at the moment they were united a brilliant spark of an extreme\r\nwhiteness that was seen by the entire society. Citizen Robertson will\r\nrepeat this experiment on the 25th.\"\r\n\r\nThe date generally given for the invention of the electric light by Sir\r\nHumphry Davy is 1809, but previous mentions of his experiment are\r\nfound in Cuthberson's \"Electricity\" (1807) and in other works. In the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_, vol. ix., p. 219, under date of Feb. 1, 1801,\r\nin a memoir by Mr. H. Moyes, of Edinburgh, relative to experiments made\r\nwith the pile, we find the following passage:\r\n\r\n\"When the column in question had reached the height of its power, its\r\nsparks were seen by daylight, even when they were made to jump with a\r\npiece of carbon held in the hand.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC LIGHTING IN PARIS IN 1844.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Journal of the Royal Institution_, vol. i. (1802), Davy\r\ndescribes (p. 106) a few experiments made with the pile, and says:\r\n\r\n\"When, instead of metals, pieces of well calcined carbon were employed,\r\nthe spark was still larger and of a clear white.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 214 he describes and figures an apparatus for taking the\r\ngalvano-electric spark into fluid and aeriform substances. This\r\napparatus consisted of a glass tube open at the top, and having at the\r\nside a tube through which passed a wire that terminated in a carbon.\r\nAnother wire, likewise terminating in carbon, traversed the bottom and\r\nwas cemented in a vertical position.\r\n\r\nBut all these indications are posterior to a letter printed in\r\n_Nicholson's Journal_, in October, 1800, p. 150, and entitled:\r\n\"Additional Experiments on Galvanic Electricity in a Letter to Mr.\r\nNicholson.\" The letter is dated Dowry Square, Hotwells, September 22,\r\n1800, and is signed by Humphry Davy, who at this epoch was assistant to\r\nDr. Beddoes at the Philosophical Institution of Bristol. It begins thus:\r\n\r\n\"Sir: The first experimenters in animal electricity remarked the\r\nproperty that well calcined carbon has of conducting ordinary galvanic\r\naction. I have found that this substance possesses the same properties\r\nas metallic bodies for the production of the spark, when it is used for\r\nestablishing a communication between the extremities of Signor Volta's\r\npile.\"\r\n\r\nIn none of these extracts, however, do we find anything that has\r\nreference to the properties of the arc as a continuous, luminous spark.\r\nIt was in his subsequent researches that Davy made known its properties.\r\nIt will be seen, however, that the electric light had attracted\r\nattention before its special property of continuity had been observed.\r\n\r\nIt results from these facts that Robertson's experiment was in no wise\r\nanterior to that of Davy. The inventor of the phantasmagoria did not\r\nobtain the arc, properly so called, with its characteristic continuity,\r\nbut merely produced a spark between two carbons--an experiment that had\r\nalready been made known by Davy in 1800. The latter had then at his\r\ndisposal nothing but a relatively weak pile, and it is very natural\r\nthat, under such circumstances, he produced a spark without observing\r\nits properties as a light producer.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1808 that he was in a position to operate upon a larger\r\nscale. At this epoch a group of men who were interested in the progress\r\nof science subscribed the necessary funds for the construction of a\r\nlarge battery designed for the laboratory of the Royal Institution. This\r\npile was composed of 2,000 elements mounted in two hundred porcelain\r\ntroughs, one of which is still to be seen at the Royal Institution. The\r\nzinc plates of these elements were each of them 32 inches square, and\r\nformed altogether a surface of 80 square meters. It was with this\r\npowerful battery that Davy, in 1810, performed the experiment on the\r\nvoltaic arc before the members of the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nThe carbons employed were rods of charcoal, and were rapidly used up\r\nin burning in the air. So in order to give longer duration to his\r\nexperiment, Davy was obliged, on repeating it, to inclose the carbons in\r\na glass globe like that used in the apparatus called the electric egg.\r\nThe accompanying figure represents the experiment made under this form\r\nin the great ampitheater of the Royal Institution at London.--_La\r\nLumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL GRAPNEL FOR SUBMARINE CABLES AND TORPEDO LINES.\r\n\r\nBy H. KINGSFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll those who are acquainted with the cable-lifting branch of submarine\r\ntelegraphy are well aware how important a matter it is in grappling\r\nto be certain of the instant the cable is hooked. This importance\r\nincreases, of course, with the age and consequent weakness of the\r\nmaterial, as the injury caused by dragging a cable along the bottom is\r\nobviously very great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRICAL GRAPNEL FOR SUBMARINE CABLES AND TORPEDO\r\nLINES.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy also to understand the fact that in nearly all cases the most\r\ndelicate dynamometers must fail to indicate immediately the presence\r\nof the cable on the grapnel, more especially in those cases where a\r\nconsiderable amount of slack grapnel rope is paid out. In many cases,\r\ntherefore, the grapnel will travel through a cable without the\r\nslightest indication (or at least reliable indication) occurring on the\r\ndynamometer, and perhaps several miles beyond the line of cable will be\r\ndragged over, either fruitlessly, or to the peril of neighboring cables;\r\nwhereas, should the engineer be advised of the cable's presence on the\r\ngrapnel, the break will probably be avoided and the cable lifted; at any\r\nrate, the position of the cable will be an assured thing.\r\n\r\nMy own knowledge of cable grappling has convinced me of these facts; and\r\nI am well assured that those engineers at least who have been engaged\r\nin grappling for cables in great depths, or for weak cables in shallow\r\nwater, will heartily agree with me.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing remarks re the insufficiency of the\r\ndynamometer as an instrument for indicating the presence of a cable on\r\nthe grapnel, I might remind engineers of the troubles and perplexities\r\nwhich occur incessantly in dragging over a rocky bottom. The grapnel\r\nhooks a rock, a large increase of strain is indicated on the\r\ndynamometer, and it becomes doubtful whether the cable as well is hooked\r\nor not. Again, it frequently happens in grappling over a rocky bottom\r\nthat one or more prongs are broken off, the grapnel thus becoming\r\nuseless, great waste of time being thus occasioned. Fully realizing all\r\nthe difficulties herein enumerated, it occurred to me that a grapnel\r\nmight be constructed in such a manner as to automatically signal by\r\nelectrical means the hooking of the cable, while it would ignore all\r\nstrain that external causes might bring to bear on it, and thereby\r\nobviate the uncertainties attached to the use of the grapnels at present\r\nin vogue. To effect this, I designed early in 1881 a grapnel fitted in\r\neach prong with an insulated conducting surface, and a plunger and pin\r\nso arranged that the cable, when hooked, should, by the pressure that\r\nit would bring to bear on any of the plungers, cause the pin to come in\r\ncontact with the conducting surface, itself in electrical communication\r\nwith any suitable current detecter and battery on board the repairing\r\nship, and thereby complete the circuit. This grapnel was successfully\r\nused on the Anglo-American Telegraph Company's repairing steamer Minia\r\nin the summer of 1881.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in discussing the construction of the grapnel with\r\nCaptain Troot, we concluded that something was yet wanted to render\r\nthe successful working in deep water absolutely sure, and we decided,\r\nconsequently, to make certain alterations.\r\n\r\nThis improved form may be constructed, either with a contact-plate in\r\neach prong, or with one contact-plate common to all the prongs; the\r\nlatter is somewhat simpler, and is therefore the plan that we usually\r\nadopt. Both forms are shown in the accompanying diagrams. The form\r\nof grapnel in Diagram No. 1 has one advantage over the other in this\r\nrespect, viz., that should a prong be ruptured so as to render it\r\nuseless, the fact would immediately be known on board. A circuit formed\r\nin such a manner, by the breaking off of a branch lead, would have\r\ngreater resistance than that formed by the contact resulting from\r\npressure of cable on the plungers; this difference would be manifested\r\non the indicator (of low resistance) placed in circuit with the\r\nalarm-bell, or, if any doubt remained, a Wheatstone's bridge, or simpler\r\nstill, a telephone might be made use of.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we may protect the plungers from the pressure of ooze,\r\netc., by guards fitted to the stem of the grapnel, but in practice we\r\nhave not found these to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe water is allowed free access around and about each separate part, in\r\norder that its pressure shall be equal on all sides. This arrangement\r\nrenders the grapnel as effectual in the deepest as in the shallowest\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBy making the plungers in two pieces, with a rubber washer or its\r\nequivalent between them, we prevent mud or ooze from getting behind and\r\ninterfering with their working. As the hole in the rubber surrounding\r\nthe contact-plate, by caused the passage of the pin through it, closes\r\nup as soon as the pressure is removed, leaving in the rubber a fault of\r\nexceedingly high resistance, the rubber does not require renewing.\r\n\r\nIn the rubber in which we embedded the contact-plate, we place a layer\r\nor more of tinfoil or other easily pierced conducting surface, through\r\nwhich the pin passes on its way to the contact-plate proper. This method\r\nwe have adopted in order to make the assurance of contact doubly sure.\r\n\r\nThe grapnel just described we had in use on the Minia since April last.\r\nWe have tried it severely, and have never known it to fail. No swivel\r\nhas been used with the rope, in the heart of which is the insulated\r\nwire, as it would allow the grapnel to turn over on the bottom, and\r\nwould be apt to twist and break the wire short off. As a matter of\r\nfact, the grapnel will turn, and does turn, with the rope; a swivel is\r\ntherefore of no value. We are perfectly awake, however, to the fact that\r\na grappling-rope should be made in a manner that will not allow it to\r\nkink; and engineers should avail themselves of such rope, especially in\r\ndeep water. Patents have lately been granted to Messrs. Trott &\r\nHamilton for the invention of a form of rope or cable answering all the\r\nrequirements of this work.\r\n\r\nA small type of grapnel fitted in the manner I have described may be\r\nvery advantageously used for searching purposes, to ascertain the\r\nposition either of telegraph or torpedo lines; by towing at a quick rate\r\nmuch time may be saved. The position being ascertained, if it be not\r\ndesired to lift the cable, the grapnel can be released and hove on board\r\nby a tripping line, which can always be attached when such work is\r\ncontemplated. The great importance of being able to localize an enemy's\r\ntorpedo lines without raising an alarm will be readily seen by engineers\r\nengaged in torpedo work.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES TO THE DIAGRAMS.\r\n\r\na, stem of the grapnel containing core; b, flukes; c, recess for\r\ninsulated contact-plate connected to core; d, covering plate screwed on\r\nbottom of grapnel; e, button of plug; f, rubber washer and button; g,\r\nmetal-plate; h, stem of plug, on which in the under counter-sink, U is\r\na small metal disk which prevents the fittings from fallings out; i,\r\nneedle; j, spring; k, counter-sink for head of plug; l, counter-sink for\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGHES' NEW MAGNETIC BALANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new magnetic balance has been described before the Royal Society\r\nby Prof. D. E. Hughes, F.R.S., which he has devised in the course of\r\ncarrying out his researches on the differences between different kinds\r\nof iron and steel. The instrument is thus described in the _Proceedings\r\nof the Royal Society_:\r\n\r\n\"It consists of a delicate silk-fiber-suspended magnetic needle, 5 cm.\r\nin length, its pointer resting near an index having a single fine black\r\nline or mark for its zero, the movement of the needle on the other\r\nside of zero being limited to 5 mm. by means of two ivory stops or\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the north end of the needle and its index zero are north, the\r\nneedle rests at its index zero, but the slightest external influence,\r\nsuch as a piece of iron 1 mm. in diameter 10 cm. distant, deflects the\r\nneedle to the right or left according to the polarity of its magnetism,\r\nand with a force proportional to its power. If we place on the opposite\r\nside of the needle at the same distance a wire possessing similar\r\npolarity and force, the two are equal, and the needle returns to zero;\r\nand if we know the magnetic value required to produce a balance, we know\r\nthe value of both. In order to balance any wire or piece of iron placed\r\nin a position east and west, a magnetic compensator is used, consisting\r\nof a powerful bar magnet free to revolve upon a central pivot placed\r\nat a distance of 30 or more cm., so as to be able to obtain delicate\r\nobservations. This turns upon an index, the degrees of which are\r\nmarked for equal degrees of magnetic action upon the needle. A coil of\r\ninsulated wire, through which a feeble electric current is passing,\r\nmagnetizes the piece of iron under observation, but, as the coil itself\r\nwould act upon the needle, this is balanced by an equal and opposing\r\ncoil on the opposite side, and we are thus enabled to observe the\r\nmagnetism due to the iron alone. A reversing key, resistance coils, and\r\na Daniell cell are required.\"\r\n\r\nThe general design of the instrument, as shown in a somewhat crude form\r\nwhen first exhibited, is given in the figure, where A is the magnetizing\r\ncoil within which the sample of iron or steel wire to be tested is\r\nplaced, B the suspended needle, C the compensating coil, and M the\r\nmagnet used as a compensator, having a scale beneath it divided into\r\nquarter degrees.\r\n\r\nThe idea of employing a magnet as compensator in a magnetic balance is\r\nnot new, this disposition having been used by Prof. Von Feilitzsch in\r\n1856 in his researches on the magnetizing influence of the current. In\r\nVon Feilitzsch's balance, however, the compensating magnet was placed\r\nend on to the needle, and its directive action was diminished at will,\r\nnot by turning it round on its center, but by shifting it to a greater\r\ndistance along a linear scale below it. The form now given by Hughes to\r\nthe balance is one of so great compactness and convenience that it\r\nwill probably prove a most acceptable addition to the resources of the\r\nphysical laboratory.--_Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO HARDEN CAST IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCast iron may be hardened as follows: Heat the iron to a cherry red,\r\nthen sprinkle on it cyanide of potassium and heat to a little above red,\r\nthen dip. The end of a rod that had been treated in this way could not\r\nbe cut with a file. Upon breaking off a piece about one-half an inch\r\nlong, it was found that the hardening had penetrated to the interior,\r\nupon which the file made no more impression than upon the surface. The\r\nsame salt may be used to caseharden wrought iron.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR MEASURING SMALL RESISTANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving shows a form of Thomson's double bridge, as\r\nmodified by Kirchhoff and Hausemann. The chief advantage claimed for\r\nthis instrument consists in the fact that all resistances of defective\r\ncontact between the piece to be measured and the battery are entirely\r\neliminated--an object of prime importance in measuring very small\r\nresistances. By the use of this instrument resistances can be measured\r\naccurately down to one-millionth of a Siemens unit.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the instrument is shown in Fig. 1; Fig. 2\r\nbeing a diagram of the electrical connections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--KIRCHHOFF AND HANSEMANN'S BRIDGE FOR MEASURING\r\nSMALL RESISTANCES.]\r\n\r\nThe piece of metal to be measured, M, is placed in the measuring forks,\r\ngg, in such a manner that the movable fork is removed as far as possible\r\nfrom the stationary one; if the weight of the piece be insufficient to\r\nsecure a good connection, additional weights may be placed upon it. The\r\nmain circuit includes the battery, B (Fig. 2), consisting of from two to\r\nfour Bunsen cells, the key, T, the German silver measuring wire, N, and\r\nthe piece of metal resting on the forks, all being joined in series. The\r\nGerman silver wire, N, is traversed by two movable knife-edge contacts,\r\ncc, as shown. Connections are made between these contacts, cc, the\r\nresistance box, the prongs, k and l, of the forks, gg, and the\r\nreflecting galvanometer, as shown in Fig. 2. A resistance of ten units\r\nis inserted at o and n, while at m and p twenty units or one thousand\r\nunits are inserted. The positions of cc are then varied until the\r\ngalvanometer shows no deflection when the key, T, is depressed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DIAGRAM SHOWING ELECTTRICAL CONNECTIONS OF\r\nBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nWhen such is the case, the ratio of resistances n/m is equal to o/p;\r\nletting M equal the resistance of the metal bar between the points, h\r\nand i, and N equal to the resistance between the points, cc, on the\r\nmeasuring wire, N, then we shall have\r\n\r\nM = N (n/m) = N (o/p).\r\n\r\nKnowing the cross section in millimeters, Q, of the bar, and observing\r\nthe temperature, t, in degrees Centigrade, its conductivity, x, as\r\ncompared with mercury can be determined. If L be the distance, h l or k\r\ni, in meters, then\r\n\r\nx = (1/m) (L/Q) (1 + at).\r\n\r\nFor pure metals the value of a may be taken at 0.004; but alloys have a\r\ndifferent coefficient.

As this might convey to the\r\ngeneral reader the impression that the magnetism thus exhibited was\r\npeculiar to New York city, and as many of your subscribers look\r\nanxiously for your answers to numerous questions put for the elucidation\r\nof apparent, scientific mysteries, I have thought that perhaps a\r\nstatement in plain language of experiments made at various times, to\r\nelucidate this subject, might, in conjunction with a diagram, serve to\r\nexplain even to those who have not made a special study of science a few\r\nof the interesting phenomena connected with\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nSome of the first experiments I made, while professor at the Indiana\r\nState University, were detailed in the March and August numbers,\r\n1872, of the _Journal_ of the Franklin Institute, and I think showed\r\nconclusively that the earth, by induction, renders all articles of iron,\r\nsteel, or tinned iron magnetic; possessing for the time being polarity,\r\nafter they have been in a settled position for a short time.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. I. C. Draper's \"Year Book of Nature\" for 1873, mention is made\r\nof the experiments in which I found every rail of a N. and S. railroad\r\nexhibiting polarity.\r\n\r\nThe same statements were repeated in one of a series of articles sent by\r\nme to the _Indianapolis Daily Journal_, dated Jan. 20, 1877, in which I\r\nused the following language:\r\n\r\n\"Every article of iron or steel or tinned iron, by the earth's\r\ninduction, becomes magnetic. Thus, if we examine our stoves, or a\r\ndoorlock, or long vertical hinge, or even a high tin cup, by holding a\r\ndelicate magnetic needle in the hand near those objects, we find the\r\nearth has, by induction, attracted to the lower end of the stove\r\nutensils, etc., the opposite magnetism from its own; and repelled to the\r\nupper end of the stove, etc., the same magnetism which exists in our\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Consequently, the bottom of the stove, or of the\r\nhinge, cup, etc., will attract the south (or unmarked end) of our\r\nneedle; while the top of the stove, etc., attracts the north, or marked\r\nend of our magnetic needle. If we apply our needle to the T rails of a\r\nN. and S. railroad, we not only find that the lower flange of the rail\r\nattracts the S. end of our needle, while the upper flange attracts the\r\nN. end of our needle, but we also find, where the two rails come nearly\r\ntogether (say within two inches), that the N. end of the rail attracts\r\nthe S. end of our needle, while the S. end of the rail attracts the N.\r\n(or marked) end of our magnetic needle.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGNETISM ON RAILWAYS.]\r\n\r\nQuite recently, being anxious to see the effect produced on the needle\r\nby rails laid E. and W., I experimented on some recently laid here;\r\nstarting from a S. terminus, in the town of New Harmony, and gradually\r\ncurving northeast, until the road pursues a due east course to\r\nEvansville. There is, however, a branch road of about half a mile, which\r\nstarts from the Wabash River, at a _west_ terminus, and runs due east\r\nto join the other, near where that main track commences its northeast\r\ncurve. The results (more readily understood by an inspection of the\r\ndiagram) were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the south terminus of the railroad, the rails on the east side of\r\nthe track as well as those on the west side attracted at their south\r\nends the marked end of a small magnetic needle, both at the upper and\r\nlower flange; the usual vertical induction being in this case overcome\r\nby the greater lateral induction. Whenever, on progressing north, the\r\nrails were at least about two inches apart, the upper flange of the\r\nnorth end of any rail would attract the unmarked, while the south end\r\nof its neighbor or any other of the north and south laid rails would\r\nattract the marked end.\r\n\r\n2. The same results were obtained from rails laid all around the\r\nnortheast curve, and even after they had acquired a due west to east\r\ncourse; showing that each rail acquired the same magnetic polarity which\r\nwould be exhibited by any magnetic needle oscillating freely in our\r\nnorthern hemisphere, dipping also at its north end considerably downward\r\nif suspended at its center of gravity.\r\n\r\n3. Applying the needle at the _west_ terminus, a few anomalies were\r\nobserved; but, especially nearer the junction, the rails all gave the\r\nnormal result found on the main track.\r\n\r\n4. The wheels of the cars standing on the north and south track followed\r\nthe same law, exhibiting both vertical and lateral induction, so that\r\nthe lower rims and the forward or north part of the periphery attracted\r\nthe unmarked end of the needle, while the upper and rear, or south\r\nportions of the periphery of the wheel attracted the marked end.\r\n\r\n5. The wheels of cars standing on the east and west road exhibited\r\nthe following modification. The lowest rim of all the wheels, whether\r\nstanding on the _north_ rails or on the _south_ rails of said track,\r\nin consequence of vertical induction attracted the unmarked end of the\r\nneedle, and the upper rims attracted the marked end of the needle; but\r\nthe middle portions of the periphery, both anterior and posterior, of\r\nthe wheels standing on the north rail, attracted the unmarked end, while\r\nsimilar middle portions of wheels standing on south rails attracted the\r\nmarked end; in consequence of horizontal induction, the wheels being\r\nconnected by iron axles, and thus presenting considerable extension\r\n_across_ the track, viz., from south to north.\r\n\r\nMagnetite seems to have acquired its polarity in the same manner,\r\nnamely by the earth's induction, when the ore contains a large enough\r\npercentage of pure iron. A large specimen (6 in. long by 3½ deep and\r\nweighing 5½ lb.) which I obtained from near Pilot Knob, Missouri,\r\nexhibits polarity, not only at its lateral ends, but also vertically,\r\nas the lower surface attracts the unmarked end of a needle, while the\r\nplane, which evidently occupied the upper surface in its native bed,\r\nattracts the marked end of the needle.\r\n\r\nIron fences invariably exhibit only the polarity by vertical induction;\r\nso also small buckets, bells, etc. But in the case of a bell about 3 ft.\r\nin diameter at its base, and over two feet deep, tapering to about a\r\nfoot in diameter at the top, I found that although the top attracted the\r\nmarked end of the needle, the bottom attracted the unmarked end of the\r\nneedle only around the northerly half of the circumference, while\r\nthe southern portion of this lower rim attracted the marked end in\r\nconsequence of lateral induction, as in N. and S. rails.\r\n\r\nThus, upon a comparison of all these facts, it would appear that, if\r\nthe magnetism induced by the earth is due to so-called currents of\r\nelectricity, those currents must be _underneath_ the rails, and must\r\nmove from west to east, under the south to north rails, and from south\r\nto north under the west to east laid rails, as indicated by the arrows\r\nin the diagram.\r\n\r\nThis accords perfectly with what we should theoretically expect, in our\r\nnorthern hemisphere, if the electricity in the earth's crust is due to\r\nthermo-electrical currents from east to west, namely, from the more\r\nheated to the less heated portion, on any given latitude, while the\r\nearth revolves from west to east; as well as also from electrical\r\ncurrents trending from tropical to Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nAs the network of iron rails spreads from year to year more extensively\r\nover our continent, it will be interesting to observe whether or not\r\nany effect is produced, meteorological, agricultural, etc., by this\r\ndiffusion of magnetism.\r\n\r\nIt may further interest some of your readers to have attention called to\r\nfacts indicating\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNCHRONOUS SEISMOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe year recently closed furnishes interesting corroborative testimony\r\nof an apparent law regarding the propagation of earthquake movements\r\n_most readily_ along great circles of our globe, as well as evidence\r\nthat these seismic movements are frequently transmitted along belts\r\n(approximating to great circles) coincident sometimes with continental\r\ntrends, at other times with fissures which emanate in radii at every\r\n30°, around the pole of the land hemisphere in Switzerland, as described\r\nin one of my papers, read at the Montreal meeting of the A.A.A.S.\r\n\r\nThe terms synchronism or synchronous, as here used, are not designed to\r\nimply absolute simultaneity (although that is sometimes the case with\r\ndisturbances 180° apart), but are rather intended to indicate the\r\ntendency presented by these phenomena to exhibit this internal activity,\r\nduring successive days, weeks, or even months, along a given great\r\ncircle of the earth, especially one or more of those connected with the\r\nland center; perhaps most of all along the great circle which forms the\r\nprime vertical, when the center of land is placed at the zenith.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the above, let us examine the record of the most\r\nprominent earthquakes or volcanic eruptions for the year 1883.\r\n\r\nLate in Dec., 1882, and early in Feb., 1883, shocks occurred in New\r\nHampshire; on Jan. 11, 1883, also at Cairo, Illinois, and about the same\r\ntime at Paducah, Ky.; Feb. 27 at Norwich, Conn., and early in Feb. at\r\nMurcia, Spain.\r\n\r\nThese, by examination of any good globe, will be found on a belt forming\r\none and the same great circle of the earth.\r\n\r\nLate in March and during part of April the volcano of Ometeke in Lake\r\nNicaragua was active (after being long dormant); Panama, portions of\r\nthe U.S. of Colombia, and of Chili; also, in May, Helena, M.T.; and,\r\nin June, Quito (with Cotopaxi active) were all more or less shaken by\r\nearthquakes; and are all found on one belt of a great circle.\r\n\r\nThe principal record for the remainder of the year comprised:\r\n\r\nAn earthquake at Tabreez in North Persia, early in May, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe awful destruction in Ischia, July 29 (with Vesuvius active).\r\n\r\nThe fearful eruption in the Straits of Sunda, 25th Aug. and later.\r\n\r\nShocks in Sumatra and at Guayaquil, about same date or early in Sept.\r\n\r\nShocks at Dusseldorf, according to a Berlin paper of 5th Sept.\r\n\r\nShocks at Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, early in Sept.\r\n\r\nShocks at Gibraltar and Anatolia in October.\r\n\r\nShocks at Malta, Trieste, and Asia Minor in October.\r\n\r\nAzram shaken late in Sept., and great destruction between Scios and\r\nSmyrna.\r\n\r\nLastly, the formation of a new island in the Aleutian Archipelago. Date\r\nof outburst, early in October, 1883.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were several other less severe disturbances, the\r\nrecords of which are chiefly obtained from Nature, and which will-be\r\nreferred to below.\r\n\r\nIf the globe be so placed as to have the land center at the zenith, the\r\nexact position of the new island, near Unnok, will be found under the\r\nbrazen meridian, while Agram, Tabreez, Sunda, Sumatra, Quito, and\r\nGuayaquil are all on the prime vertical.\r\n\r\nVesuvius and Hecla were both active early in the year, and they, with\r\nthe ever restless Stromboli, are situated on the great circle which\r\nforms with the land center at Mount Rosa, the radius running S. 30° E.,\r\nand which would embrace the chief disturbances up to the middle of the\r\nyear, including as we go north Malta, Sicily, Rome, region of the Po,\r\nBologna, and in the Western Continent, after passing Hecla, Helena in\r\nMontana Territory, reaching in Washington Territory and Oregon the belt\r\nof it. American volcanoes: Mounts Baker, Rainier, St. Helens, Hood, and\r\nShasta.\r\n\r\nStill another seismic belt, starting from the ever active Fogo, and\r\npassing through Teneriffe (at that time erupted), would include the\r\nregions disturbed in Oct. and Nov., namely, Cadiz, Gibraltar, Malaga\r\n(Murcia and Valencia somewhat earlier); it then traversed the center of\r\nland, caused the earthquakes at Olmutz in Moravia, and even tremors felt\r\nat Irkutsk, as the seismic war moved along said great circle to the\r\nvolcanic region of S. Japan.\r\n\r\nAgain, the belt which covers the meridian of land center (about 8°-10°\r\nE. long) covers also the region of a disturbanced area in Norway, as\r\nwell as that portion of Algeria, viz., Bona, in which a mountain 800\r\nmeters high, Naiba, is gradually sinking out of sight. About 100 geo.\r\nmiles E. of Bona is where Graham's Island appeared in the Mediterranean,\r\nand a few months later disappeared in deep water.\r\n\r\nAnother highly seismic belt extends from the volcanoes of Bourbon, N.\r\nMadagascar, and Abyssinia to Santoria and the oft disturbed Scios,\r\nSmyrna, and Anatolia region; and along the same great circle were shaken\r\nPatra in Greece on the 14th Nov., and Bosnia on the 15th; while shocks\r\nhad been felt at Trieste and Mülhouse about the 11th, and at Styria on\r\nthe 7th, and disturbances at Dusseldorf in Sept. Finally, on the 28th\r\nDec. S. Hungary (near the confluence of the Drave with the Danube) was\r\nvisited by seismic movements along this same great circle, which passes\r\nthrough the extinct volcanic region of the Eifel, the oft shaken Comrie\r\nin Perthshire, Scotland, the volcanic Iceland, our National Park with\r\nits thousands of geysers, the cataclysmic region of Salt Lake and the\r\nWahsatch Mountains (so graphically described by the geologists of the\r\nU.S. Geol. Survey), giving rise in Sept. to the earthquakes of Los\r\nAngeles and Santa Barbara, and finally reaching the volcanic islands of\r\nthe Marquesas group.\r\n\r\nThus the seismic efforts of 1883 may be seen to have expended their\r\nforce partly along the great backbone of the S. and N. American\r\nCordillera, but more especially from the center of land E. and W. along\r\nits prime vertical from Sunda to Quito, also southwesterly by the E.\r\ncoast of Spain, as well as due S. through Algeria, and S. 30° E. through\r\nRome, Naples, Sicily, etc. Finally, the autumnal catastrophes at and\r\nnear Scios, Anatolia, etc., seem to have been caused by a seismic wave,\r\npropagated along the great circle, which often agitates Janina, and\r\nproduces earthquakes at Agram, where this great circle crosses the prime\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\nRICHARD OWEN.\r\n\r\nNew Harmony, Ind., 27 Feb., 1884.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRON INDUSTRY IN BRAZIL\r\n\r\n(PROVINCE OF MINAS GERAES.)\r\n\r\nBy Prof. P. FERRAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, the methods employed in the province of Minas\r\nGeraes (Brazil) for obtaining iron permit of manufacturing it direct\r\nfrom the ore without the intervening process of casting. These methods\r\nare two in number:\r\n\r\n1. The _method by cadinhes_ (crucibles), which is the simpler and\r\nrequires but little manipulation, but permits of the production of but a\r\nsmall quantity of metal at a time.\r\n\r\n2. The _Italian method_, a variation of the Catalan, which requires\r\nmore skill on the part of the workmen and yields more iron than the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\nAs these methods seem to me of interest, from the standpoint of their\r\nsimplicity and easy installation, I propose to describe them briefly, in\r\norder to give as faithful and general an _aperçu_ as possible of their\r\napplication. At present I shall deal with the first one only, the one\r\ncalled the method by _Cadinhes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE METHOD BY CADINHES.\r\n\r\nThe province of Minas Geraes ocupies a vast extent in the empire\r\nof Brazil, its superficies being about 900,000 square kilometers,\r\nrepresenting nearly a third of the total surface.\r\n\r\nThe population is relatively small and is disseminated throughout a much\r\nbroken country, where the means of communication are very few. So it is\r\nnecessary to succeed in producing what iron is needed by means that are\r\nsimple and that require but quickly erected works built of such material\r\nas may be at hand. The iron ore is found in very great abundance in this\r\nregion and is very easily mined.\r\n\r\nIn the center of a mass of quartzites that seem lo constitute the upper\r\nlevel of the eruptive grounds of the province, there are found strata of\r\nan ore of iron designated as _itabirite_--a mixture of oxide of iron and\r\nquartz. These strata are of great thickness, and have numerous outcrops\r\nthat permit of their being worked by quarrying.\r\n\r\nThese itabirites present themselves under two very distinct aspects and\r\noffer a certain difference in their composition. Some are essentially\r\nfriable, and are called by the vulgar name of _jacutingaes_. It is\r\nthis variety (which is the one most easily mined) that is principally\r\nconsumed in the forges. The others, on the contrary, are compact.\r\nTheir exploitation is more difficult, and before putting them into the\r\nfurnaces it is necessary to submit them to breakage and screening; so\r\nthe use of them is more limited.\r\n\r\nThe first variety contains less iron and more gangue, but, _per contra_,\r\npossesses much oxide of manganese. The second, on the contrary, is\r\nformed almost wholly of oxide of iron with but little gangue and only\r\ntraces of oxide of manganese. The following are analyses of these two\r\nvarieties of ore:\r\n\r\n  _Friable Ore_.\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}O_{2}.................................. 84.9\r\n  Oxide of manganese...........................  9.2\r\n  Water........................................  1.9\r\n  Quartz.......................................  4.1\r\n                                                ----\r\n                                               100.1\r\n\r\n  _Compact Ore_.\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}O_{3} and traces of manganese.......... 99.6\r\n  Quartz.......................................  1.1\r\n                                                ----\r\n                                               100.7\r\n\r\n_Situation of the Forges_.--A forge is usually placed on the bank of\r\na brook, or rather of a torrent, which supplies the fall of water\r\nnecessary for the motive power by means of a flume about a hundred\r\nmeters in length. In most cases the forge is surrounded on all sides\r\nwith a forest which yields the wood necessary for the manufacture of the\r\ncharcoal, and is in the vicinity of the iron quarry, so as to reduce the\r\nexpense of hauling the ore as much as possible. The neighboring\r\nrocks furnish the foundation stones and stones for the furnaces; the\r\ndecomposed schist gives the cement and refractory coating, and the\r\nforest provides the wood necessary for the construction of the road,\r\nsheds, etc. The head of the trip hammer, the anvils, and the tools are\r\nthe only objects that it is necessary to procure, and even these\r\nthe master of the forge often manufactures in part, after beginning\r\nproduction with an incomplete set.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7a FIG 1.--FOUR-CRUCIBLE FURNACE AND FORGE; (PLAN).]\r\n\r\n_General Arrangement of a Forge_.--A forge usually consists of one or\r\ntwo furnaces of three or four crucibles (the one shown in plan in Fig.\r\n1 has only one four crucible furnace, A); 1 or 2 two fire reheating\r\nfurnaces, B; 1 trip hammer, C, actuated by a hydraulic wheel, D;\r\n2 tromps which drive the wind, one of them, E, into the cadinhes\r\n(crucibles), and the other, F, into the reheating furnace; 2 anvils,\r\nG and H, placed near the furnace, for working delicate pieces; and\r\nfinally, the different tools that serve for maneuvering the bloom and\r\nfinishing the bars. The charcoal is preserved from rain under a shed, l.\r\nThe ore, which is brought in as needed, is dumped in a pile at M, in\r\nthe vicinity of the crucibles. The buildings are set back against the\r\nmountain, and the water is led in by a double flume, L and N, made of\r\nplanks, and empties on one side into the wheel and into the tromp, F,\r\nand on the other into the tromp, E, and then runs into a double waste\r\nchannel, P and Q, which carries it to the stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 2.--FOUR-CRUCIBLE FURNACE; (PLAN).]\r\n\r\n_Four Crucible Furnace_ (Fig. 2).--The arrangement of a furnace is very\r\nsimple. It consists of a cube of masonry containing several cylindrical\r\napertures with elliptic bases, whose large axis is paralleled with the\r\nsmaller side of the masonry. This form recalls that of a crucible;\r\nand these cavities are, moreover, so named. In the front part of each\r\ncadinhe there is a rectangular aperture that gives access to the bottom\r\nof the crucible and facilitates the removal of the bloom therefrom. At\r\nthe back part there is a small aperture for the introduction of the\r\ntuyere, and which permits, besides, of the nozzle of the latter being\r\neasily got at so as to see whether the blast is working properly.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the crucibles are covered with a thin layer of refractory\r\nclay, and their bottoms have a spherical concavity to hold the bloom.\r\nThe tuyere, which is fitted to a wooden conduit of square section\r\nthat runs along the back of the masonry, is placed in the axis of the\r\ncadinhes and enters the masonry at a few centimeters from the bottom\r\nin such away that its nozzle comes just flush with the surface of the\r\nrefractory lining. This arrangement prevents the tuyere from getting\r\nbefouled by scoriæ during the operation of the furnace and thus\r\ninterfering with the wind.\r\n\r\n_Tromp_.--The tromp which furnishes the necessary wind to the cadinhes\r\nconsists of a hollow wooden conduit, a (Fig. 3), of square section,\r\nwhich enters a chamber, b, along a length of 0.1 m. This conduit, which\r\nis about 7 meters in height, receives the water from the flume through\r\nthe intermedium of an ajutage of pyramidal form, which serves to choke\r\nthe vein of liquid, and the extremity of which is at a few centimeters\r\nfrom the conduit in order to facilitate the entrance of the air; the\r\nlatter being attracted by an ill defined action that is supposed to\r\nbe due to its being carried along by the water, and to a depression\r\nproduced by choking the flow of the liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THE TROMP.]\r\n\r\nSince the air that is sucked in during the operation has constantly same\r\npressure, there is no valve for regulating the entrance of the water\r\ninto the vertical conduit. Upon issuing from the latter, the mixture of\r\nair and water strikes the surface of the water in the chamber, b,\r\nand the violence of the shock upon the bottom is deadened by the\r\ninterposition of a stone. While the water is escaping through a lateral\r\naperture in the chamber, b, the air is reaching the tuyeres through a\r\nwooden conduit of square section which is fitted to an aperture in the\r\nupper part of the chamber. This sorry arrangement, which obliges the\r\nmixture of air and water to penetrate the water at the bottom of the\r\nupright conduit, a, retards the separation of the two fluids, and\r\nresults in damp air being forced into the crucibles.\r\n\r\n_The Trip Hammer_.--Fig. 4 shows the general arrangement of the\r\napparatus that go to make up the forging mill. The hammer and cam shaft\r\nhave their axes parallel, and the latter is placed in the prolongation\r\nof the axis of the wheel. The hammer consists of a roughly squared beam,\r\n4 meters in length, and of 0.25 m. section. The head, A, consists of a\r\nmass of iron weighing 150 kilos, including the weight of the straps\r\nthat surround the beam on every side of the piece of iron. The axis of\r\nrotation is situated at the other extremity of the beam, B. The cam\r\nshaft which serves to maneuver the trip hammer is provided with four\r\ncams which lift the beam at a point near the hammer. The length of this\r\nshaft (to the extremity of which is adapted the water wheel) is 4.75 m.,\r\nand its diameter is 0.50 m. The wheel is an _overshot_ one, 3.25 m. in\r\ndiameter by 1 m. in width. The water, which is led to it by a flume,\r\nacts upon it by its weight and impact, and is retained in the buckets\r\nand kept from overshooting the mark by a jacket made of planks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--THE TRIP HAMMER.]\r\n\r\nThe anvil upon which the hammer strikes is surrounded by a bed of stones\r\n(quartzites) derived from the neighboring rocks. It is a mass of iron,\r\n75 kilogrammes in weight. In order to prevent vibrations in the trip\r\nhammer when it is lifted, and increase the number of blows, there is\r\nestablished a spring beam, which is formed of unsquared timber, which\r\nis firmly fastened at one of its extremities, and which receives at the\r\nother end the shock of the hammer head when the latter reaches the end\r\nof its upward travel.\r\n\r\n_Reheating Furnace_.--This is a double fire furnace, like those used in\r\nour smithies, except that the wind, instead of being forced into it by\r\nmeans of a bellows, is supplied by a tromp which receives water from the\r\nsame channel as the wheel. The two furnace tuyeres are arranged exactly\r\nlike those of the cadinhes, upon a wooden conduit which starts from the\r\nwind chamber (Fig. 5). This furnace serves to prevent the cooling of\r\nsuch blooms as are awaiting their turn to be shingled, and of such bars\r\nof finished iron as are being made into tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATION OF THE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nA forge like the one whose plan we give, may be run with 1 workman at\r\nthe cadinhes, 1 assistant, 1 workman at the hammer; total, 3 men.\r\n\r\n_Furnace_.--The work lasts about twelve hours per day, and three\r\noperations of three to four hours are performed in each cadinhe, thus\r\nmaking twelve per day. At each operation, 22.5 kilos. of ore and 45 of\r\ncharcoal are used. From this there is obtained a bloom of 15 kilos. The\r\noperation is performed as follows:\r\n\r\nWhile the assistant has gone to put the bloom of the preceding operation\r\nunder the hammer, the workman prepares at the bottom of the crucible a\r\nbed consisting of a mixture of sand and very fine charcoal, and then\r\nfills the crucible up to its edge with charcoal. At the end of a quarter\r\nof an hour, the fuel being thoroughly aglow, the workman puts in the\r\nfirst charge of ore in powder (_jacutingue_), about 2 kilos, and covers\r\nit with charcoal.\r\n\r\nStarting from this moment, he goes on charging every five or ten minutes\r\nwith 1.5 to 2 kilos of ore, taking care in doing so to keep the crucible\r\nstuffed with charcoal, which the assistant places in piles around each\r\ncadinhe. This lasts about two and one-half hours. At the end of this\r\ntime he stops putting in charcoal, and standing upon the masonry, walks\r\nfrom one cadinhe to another, carrying a large rod, in order to study the\r\nlay of the bloom. Then, the fire being entirely out, he scrapes out the\r\nbed of sand and charcoal that closes the opening in the bottom of the\r\ncrucible, removes the mass of ferruginous scoriæ which forms a hard\r\npaste and surrounds the bloom, and takes this latter out by means of a\r\nhook.\r\n\r\nThe workman runs the four cadinhes at once, this being easily enough\r\ndone, since he has neither to bother himself with regulating the wind,\r\nwhich enters always with the same pressure, nor with the flow of the\r\nscoriæ, which remain always at the bottom of the crucible. His role\r\nconsists simply in keeping his fires running properly, being guided in\r\nthis by the color of the flame without making an examination in the\r\ninterior. He draws each of the four blooms out from its bed at the end\r\nof the operation, while the assistant carries the first to the hammer\r\nand the three others to the reheating furnace. He afterward cleans\r\nout the crucible, prepares the bed of sand and charcoal, fills with\r\ncharcoal, and then passes to the next, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--REHEATING FURNACE.]\r\n\r\n_Trip Hammer_.--The workman at the hammer takes the bloom from the hands\r\nof the assistant and shingles it under the head. Then he begins to give\r\nit shape, bringing it to the state shown at c, in Fig. 7. The assistant\r\nthen brings him another bloom and takes the one that has been shingled\r\nto the reheating furnace, where he heats but one of its extremities.\r\nWhen the four blooms have been shingled, the workman takes up the first\r\nand begins to draw out one of its extremities, which he afterward cools\r\nin water and uses as a handle for finishing the work, d. Then he reheats\r\nthe other extremity, and, after drawing it out as he did the other,\r\nobtains a bar of finished iron which he doubles, as shown at e, to thus\r\ndeliver to the trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--CADINHE IN OPERATION.]\r\n\r\nOne of these bars weighs from 11 to 12 kilogrammes. It will be seen\r\nthat, during the course of the work, the furnace workmen and the hammer\r\nworkmen have well defined duties to perform; but it is not the same with\r\nthe assistant, who goes from one to the other according to requirements.\r\nThere are, however, some forges in which each of the workmen has an\r\nassistant, since the blooms produced are heavier, and one assistant\r\nwould not suffice for the work of the two men. In such a case the\r\nassistant at the crucibles carries the blooms to the reheating furnace,\r\nand the assistant at the hammer carries them from thence to the hammer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--WORKING THE BLOOM.]\r\n\r\n\r\nELABORATION OF THE ORE.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the workman who has charge of the fire contents\r\nhimself with putting charcoal and ore alternately into the crucibles,\r\nand that too according to the aspect of the flames, without making any\r\nexamination in the interior, in order to judge whether the work is\r\nproceeding well. The bloom forms gradually beneath the nozzle of the\r\ntuyere, in the center of the bed of sand and charcoal, and is surrounded\r\non every side with an exceedingly pasty mass, formed of silicates of\r\niron and manganese (Fig. 7). It is only at the end of the operation that\r\nthe workman, by means of a rod, causes the burning coal to drop and\r\nverifies the proper position of the bloom by breaking the layer of\r\nscoriæ that surrounds it. This coating he breaks off, removes the bloom\r\nwith a hook, and agglutinates with his rod the different bubbles that it\r\nexhibits, and the assistant then carries it to the hammer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING UP A FORGE.--SELLING PRICE OF THE IRON.\r\n\r\nTo set up a forge like the one we have described, it is necessary to\r\ncount upon a first cost of about 10,000 francs. Add to this the cost of\r\n50 hectares of forest to furnish the charcoal that the workmen have to\r\nmake every day. The cost of this is very variable, and floats between\r\n2,500 and 5,000 francs per 100 hectares. The cost the ore is only that\r\nconnected with getting it but and hauling it.\r\n\r\n_Manual Labor_.--The charcoal burners receive 1.25 francs per load of 90\r\nkilos, thus bringing the price of the product (including cost price of\r\nforest) at 2.4 francs per 100 kilos. The workmen in the furnace are paid\r\nat the rate of from 2.50 to 3.75 francs per day. Those that work the\r\nhammers receive 3.75 francs, and the assistants 1.25 francs.\r\n\r\n_Carriage of the Forged Iron_.--The iron is carried from the forge\r\nto the places of consumption on the backs of mules, and the cost of\r\ncarriage is, on an average, 0.25 franc per 100 kilos and per kilometer.\r\n\r\n_Selling Price_.--The selling price is very variable, and depends\r\nprincipally upon the distance of the place where sold from the different\r\nforges that surround it. At Ouro Preto the price varies between 45 and\r\n50 francs per 100 kilos.\r\n\r\nThe following is a _resume_ of the data which precede:\r\n\r\nCost of first establishment.................. 10,000 fr.\r\nCharcoal per kilogramme......................   2.40\r\n                      { Furnace men.... 2.50 to 3.75\r\nManual labor per day  { Hammer men............. 3.75\r\n                      { Assistants............. 1.25\r\nCarriage of forged iron per kilometric ton..... 2.50\r\nSelling price per 100 kilos................ 45 to 50\r\n\r\n--_Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEAMER CHURCHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe give engravings of the Churchill, a vessel lately built to the order\r\nof Mr. Walter Peace, London agent to the Natal Harbor Board, by Messrs.\r\nHall, Russell, and Co., Aberdeen. She was designed by Mr. J.F. Flannery,\r\nconsulting engineer to the Board, for special service at Natal. The\r\nChurchill has been constructed so as to be capable of towing into or out\r\nof harbor over the bar in any weather, of acting as a very powerful fire\r\nengine, of carrying a large amount of fresh water for the use of other\r\nships, of landing troops from transports which the harbor is too shallow\r\nto admit, of recovering lost anchors and cables, of which there are a\r\nlarge number off the coast, and of acting in time of need as a torpedo\r\nor coast defense vessel; she was launched on the 16th August, and is\r\nlikely to fulfill all these requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW STEAMSHIP CHURCHILL.]\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of the vessel are: Length between\r\nperpendiculars 115 feet, breadth, extreme, 22 feet, depth of hold 11\r\nfeet, and maximum draught with full bunkers 7 feet 6 inches. There are\r\nfour water-tight iron bulkheads forming five compartments; the stern is\r\nbuilt very full to protect the propellers. Accommodation is arranged on\r\ndeck for the captain aft with two spare berths, mate and two engineers\r\namidships, while six white hands will occupy the forward forecastle, and\r\nsix Kaffirs the after one. For towing purposes she is fitted with one\r\nmain and two skip hooks secured to the main framing; towing rails are\r\nplaced aft, while bitts are put on one each quarter, will be seen by\r\nreferring to the deck plan.\r\n\r\nThe vessel is propelled by twin screws 6 feet 8 inches in diameter and\r\n13 feet 6 inches pitch; these are of cast iron, have four blades, and\r\nare driven by a double pair of compound inverted direct acting engines\r\n(see Figs. 4 to 7) which are capable of developing 600 indicated horse\r\npower, and whose cylinders are 19 inches and 34 inches in diameter with\r\na stroke of 2 feet. The condensers form part of the engine frame, and\r\nhave guide faces cast on for the crosshead shoes. They are fitted with\r\ngun metal tube-plates, and each contain 516 tubes, 3/4 inch in diameter,\r\nwhich have an exposed length of 6 feet 5 inches, and give a total\r\ncooling surface of 650 square feet. The air and circulating pumps are\r\nbolted to the back of the condensers, and are worked by levers from the\r\nengine crosshead. Each engine has one feed and one bilge pump attached\r\nto the air pump, and worked by the same lever. The plan of the engines\r\nshows the pump arrangement very completely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGINES AND BOILERS OF THE NEW STEAMSHIP CHURCHILL.]\r\n\r\nThe steam is supplied by two circular return tube boilers, 9 feet 6\r\ninches in diameter and 10 feet long, with two furnaces in each. The\r\nboilers, which are of steel throughout, except the tubes, are placed\r\nlongitudinally, and are fitted with two pairs of the Martyn-Roberts\r\npatent safety valves. They have one steam dome between them. The total\r\nheating surface is 1,700 square feet, the total steam space is 330 cubic\r\nfeet, and the working pressure 100 lb. per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe fire pump is a Wilson's \"Excelsior,\" with 10 inch steam cylinder and\r\n8 inch water barrel. This powerful pump is in a special compartment of\r\nthe fore hold, and will draw water from the bilge, sea, or either hold.\r\nA steam windlass and a double-handle winch are on deck as shown. On\r\ntrial trip the engines of the Churchill indicated a maximum of 645.5\r\nhorse power, driving the vessel 10.495 knots per hour. The vessel is\r\nremarkable for diversity of uses, for heavy engine power in a small\r\nhull, and for general compactness of arrangement.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE-WAY TUNNELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. T.R. Cramton, who at the Southampton meeting of the British\r\nAssociation suggested a method of tunneling which, under certain\r\nconditions, seems of excellent promise, brought forward a suggestion at\r\nSouthport for the construction of three-way tunnels. Now, the undoubted\r\naim of all engineers is economy of construction and the securing of\r\npermanent advantages. Mr. Crampton maintains that the suggested system\r\nwill give these, that three tunnels of, say, 17 ft. diameter, can be\r\nconstructed cheaper than one of 30 ft. diameter. After describing Sir J.\r\nC. Hawkshaw's scheme for the ventilation of long tunnels, the three-way\r\nscheme was discussed. Three separate tunnels of 17 ft. diameter each,\r\nor 227 ft. area, are to be connected by large passages about midway\r\nof their length. These passages are without valves; in fact, free air\r\npassages. Between these midway connections and the ends, say again\r\nmidway between, is formed a branch at right angles either above or below\r\nwith separate openings from the branch into the other tunnels, such\r\nopenings being provided with doors or valves quite clear of the main\r\ntunnel, any two of which may be closed, thus separating at this point\r\nthe corresponding tunnels from the third. The branch is to be led to any\r\nconvenient position where the exhustion apparatus can be placed. If two\r\nof the tunnels are left open to this branch, and the third one shut off\r\nfrom it by closing the doors, the vitiated air will be drawn from the\r\ntwo working tunnels, through the connecting branch, while fresh air will\r\nbe partly sucked down the vertical shafts through their open ends and\r\npartly at the center tunnel, which is supplied by forcing air down the\r\nvertical shaft in communication with it, a stop or door being placed\r\njust outside of the bottom of the shaft so as to compel the air to flow\r\nto the center of the tunnel. It will be observed that no trains are\r\nrunning in this air tunnel so long as it is so used; there are similar\r\ndoors for the working tunnel, but they are kept open, unless either of\r\nthem is required to be made into an air tunnel, so that the passing\r\ntrains run no risk of running into the doors. By means of the doors\r\nabove mentioned, any one of the three tunnels can be used as a fresh-air\r\ntunnel, in which the men doing the repairs to the road would be clear of\r\nthe traffic, while the other two are used for the traffic, as well as\r\noutlets for the mixed impure gas and air. If a breakdown of a train\r\noccurs in any one tunnel, that tunnel can at once be converted into a\r\nfresh-air one, while its traffic is transferred to the one previously\r\nused for air, thereby avoiding delay. The system described for splitting\r\nthe air and drawing off the noxious gases is very similar to that\r\ndescribed by Mr. Hawkshaw at Southampton. The valves and other details\r\nbeing added, to make the system applicable to three tunnels, it will\r\nbe obvious that other modes of ventilation may be adopted. In order to\r\nreduce the number of men working in the tunnel it is proposed, if found\r\npracticable, not to adopt the ordinary ballast and cross sleepers, but\r\nto substitute the longitudinal timber system, the timbers to be secured\r\nto brickwork or concrete, forming a part of the tunnel lining, placing\r\nefficient elastic material between the foundation and longitudinals for\r\ntheir whole area, also between the rails and sleepers. An open drain is\r\nformed between the rails; by this plan any water accumulating flows over\r\nsmooth surfaces through small channels into a drain, the tunnel on each\r\nside being dry. The saving of labor in repairs, if this system can be\r\nemployed, is so evident that a large amount of money might be expended\r\nin endeavoring to discover a suitable elastic material for the purpose.\r\nThere are data on many long viaducts sufficient to justify experiments\r\nbeing made on the subject, and it is not unreasonable to expect that\r\nsuitable material may be met with. In very long tunnels nothing should\r\nbe omitted tending to reduce the number of men working in them. The\r\nopinion was expressed that in tunnels passing through solid materials,\r\nand proper foundations being made for the longitudinals to rest upon,\r\nwith good elastic material placed between the rails and sleepers and\r\nfoundations, one-half of the men employed on the ordinary cross sleeper\r\nroad resting on ballast would be saved, more particularly as the repairs\r\nare effected in pure air free from the traffic as explained. The\r\nestimate as to the cost of this system was upon the dimensions given by\r\nSir J. Hawkshaw, and the following gives the comparison:\r\n\r\nThe quantity of excavation and brickwork or concrete in each case will\r\nbe as follows: Single tunnel: 30 ft. diameter lining, 3 ft. thick, with\r\nthe brickwork forming the air passage = to 36.5 cubic yards per yard\r\nforward. Excavation to outside of brickwork 36 ft. diameter = to 113\r\ncubic yards per yard forward. Three tunnels 17 ft. diameter and 18 in.\r\nbrickwork. Brickwork lining for three tunnels = 24.5 cubic yards per\r\nyard forward. Excavation outside brickwork for the same 105 cubic yards\r\nper yard forward. It is assumed that three 17 ft. tunnels are stronger,\r\nmore conveniently formed, and involve less risks in construction than\r\none of 30 ft. diameter; at the same time there is no difficulty in\r\nmaking the latter. The above shows the saving in the three tunnels of\r\n23 per cent. in brickwork, and about 7 per cent. of earthwork, compared\r\nwith one of 30 ft. With regard to ventilation, it is well known that the\r\npower required to force air along passages is practically as the cube of\r\nthe velocity; and as the area of the air passages in the single tunnel\r\nis 106 ft. with speed ten miles per hour, and that of one of the 17 ft.\r\ndiameter is 227 ft., or rather more than double, giving only five miles\r\nper hour velocity, it follows that the power for this portion would be\r\neight times less. That for the working tunnels would be practically the\r\nsame, the velocities being nearly alike in both cases, which would be\r\nabout 2½ miles per hour--the 30 ft. having an area of 470 ft., the\r\ntwo single ones together about 450 ft. Upon the face of it the system\r\ndeserves a trial. A full consideration of the scheme by engineers\r\npreparing plans for new tunnels would no doubt throw further light\r\nupon the subject and be of interest wherever such work is\r\ncontemplated.--_Contract Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONT ST. MICHEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one who has the slightest regard for historical monuments, who\r\nvalues mediæval architecture, or cares in the least degree for the\r\nbeautiful and the picturesque, must heartily sympathize with M. Victor\r\nHugo in his protest against the proposed scheme for uniting the\r\nwonderful island of Mont St. Michel with the mainland by means of a\r\n_causeway_, and possibly a _railway_!\r\n\r\nThose who know Mont St. Michel well, and, like the writer, have spent\r\nseveral days upon the island, cannot but feel that such a scheme would\r\nnot only be a frightful disfigurement, but would entirely destroy all\r\nthe associations and the poetry of the place. Practical people will\r\nsay, \"Modern improvement cannot stop in its march forward to consider\r\npoetical associations and mere artistic whims and fancies.\" Now, this\r\nwould be a possible argument if Mont St. Michel were a busy, thriving\r\ntown, a commercial port, or the seat of great industries; but in a case\r\nwhere the only trade is that of touting, the only visitors sightseers,\r\nthe only \"stock-in-trade\" mediæval remains, surely, from a practical\r\npoint of view, anything which will injure these antiquities will really\r\ndestroy the importance of the island, as its _only_ value consists in\r\nits wonderful historic and artistic associations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONT ST. MICHEL, NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of Mont St. Michel is strange and weird in the\r\nextreme. A vast ghostlike object of a very pale pinkish hue suddenly\r\nrises out of the bay, and one's first impression is that one has been\r\nreading the \"Arabian Nights,\" and that here is one of those fairy\r\npalaces which will fly off, or gradually fade away, or sink bodily\r\nthrough the water. Its solemn isolation, its unearthly color, and its\r\nflamelike outline fill the mind with astonishment.\r\n\r\nMont St. Michel is by far the most perfect example of a mediæval\r\nfortified abbey in existence, with its surrounding town and\r\ndependencies, all quite perfect; just, in fact, as if time had stood\r\nstill with them since the fifteenth century. The great granite rock\r\nrises to the height of two hundred and thirty feet out of the bay; it\r\nis twice an island and twice a peninsula in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours. The only approach is at low water, by driving or walking across\r\nthe sands. When, however, one arrives within a few yards of the solitary\r\ngate to the \"town,\" walking or driving has to be abandoned, and here\r\nthe commercial industries of the inhabitants commence. A number of\r\nindividuals, half sailors and half fishermen, are standing ready to\r\ncarry you on their shoulders over the small gully, which is very rarely\r\nquite dry. Entering through the old gate one sees two ancient pieces\r\nof cannon taken from the English, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the\r\nplace in 1422. Close to the gate are the two rival inns, which are very\r\nprimitive in their arrangement, the entrance hall forming the kitchen,\r\nas in many old Breton houses. A second frowning old gateway leads to the\r\nsingle street, which, passing between two rows of antique gabled houses,\r\nand under the chancel of the little parish church, conducts one to the\r\nalmost interminable flight of stone steps leading to the gateway of\r\nthe monastery. Upon ringing the bell a polite lay brother opens the\r\niron-studded door, and we are admitted into a solemn, vaulted hall, with\r\nanother stone staircase opposite. Here we go up and up, to a second\r\nvaulted hall, where, in olden times, we should have had to give up any\r\narms which we were carrying. Then another stone staircase, which lands\r\nus in a small court with a well in it, at the opposite end of which is a\r\nheavy and solid arched doorway. We pass through this, expecting to find\r\nourselves on the top of the central tower of the church at least, and\r\nare surprised to find ourselves in the solemn and almost dark crypt of\r\nthe church. Here we have climbed up some 230 feet above the world and\r\nthe sea to find ourselves in an underground vault; up in the air and\r\ndown under the rock at the same time. Wonderfully beautiful is this\r\nstrange crypt, when one's eye gets accustomed to the gloom, with its\r\nexquisite ribbed and vaulted roof, supported upon huge circular columns.\r\nReturning to the court, another doorway conducts us into a most superb\r\nGothic hall, with a row of slender columns down the center. This was the\r\nmonks' refectory in ancient times; adjoining this is another grand hall,\r\ndivided into four aisles by rows of granite columns, all of the most\r\nperfect thirteenth century work. Above these are two other halls, still\r\nmore magnificent than those below. One of these, called the \"Salle des\r\nChevaliers,\" is probably the most beautiful Gothic hall in existence.\r\nAgain a flight of stone stairs, and we find ourselves, where we should\r\ncertainly not have expected, in the cloisters of the monastery, the\r\nexquisite architecture of which, with its countless marble columns and\r\ndelicate double arcades, cannot be described.\r\n\r\nThe church deserves a few words, as it is a veritable cathedral as to\r\nsize and grandeur. The choir is immensely lofty, and constructed of\r\ngranite most elaborately wrought in the later Gothic or flamboyant\r\nstyle. The nave and transepts are in the old Romanesque style, with\r\nsolid pillars and low round arches. The church is beautifully kept, and\r\ncontains some very interesting old reredoses and altars with carving in\r\nalabaster. The one modern altar in the Lady Chapel is composed entirely\r\nof silver! Our space will not permit us to describe the numerous\r\ninteresting old Abbey buildings--the library, the prior's lodging, the\r\nvast kitchen, the prisons, the dungeons, and the means of supplying the\r\nplace in times of siege. The proposed causeway would join the island to\r\nthe left of our view, and our readers can imagine the abominable effect\r\nof a high embankment disfiguring this point, and breaking through the\r\ninteresting old walls and towers, with, perhaps, a Brummagem Gothic\r\nstation against the old time-worn gateway.--_H.

It is often used in the crudest and most\r\ncostly way; a burner may be perfect for one purpose, yet exceedingly\r\nwasteful for another, and however good it may be, an error of judgment\r\nin its application may lead to its total condemnation. An excess of\r\nchimney draught, in cases where a flue is necessary, may pull in\r\nsufficient excess of cold air to almost neutralize the whole power of\r\nthe burner, unless a damper is used with judgment. With solid fuel, an\r\nexcess of draught causes more fuel to be burnt, but with gas the fuel\r\nis adjusted and limited; there is no margin or store of fuel ready to\r\ncombine with the excess of air, which, therefore, lowers the amount\r\nof work done by its cooling power. The power of any burner, for any\r\nspecified purpose, depends not only on its perfection, but to a far\r\ngreater extent on the difference in the temperature of the flame and of\r\nthe object to be heated. For instance, if a bright red heat is required,\r\nit is not possible to obtain this temperature economically with any\r\nburner working without an artificial blast of air; the difference\r\nbetween the temperature of the flame and that of the object heated is\r\ntoo little to enable the heat to be taken up freely or quickly, and\r\nthe result is a large loss of costly fuel. If we want to obtain high\r\ntemperatures economically, an artificial blast of air is necessary,\r\nand the heavier the pressure of air, the greater the economy. On the\r\ncontrary, low temperatures and diffused heat are obtained best by flames\r\nwithout any artificial air supply.\r\n\r\nFor such purposes as ovens, disinfecting chambers, japanners' stoves,\r\nfounders' core drying, and similar requirements the best results are\r\nobtained by a number of separate jets of flame at the lowest part of the\r\ninclosed space, and the use of either illuminating or blue flames is a\r\nmatter of no importance, as the total amount of heated air from either\r\ncharacter of flame is the same. If there is any preference, it may be\r\ngiven to illuminating flames, as the proportion of radiant heat is\r\ngreater, and this makes the average temperature of the inclosed space\r\nmore equal; but on the other hand, may be considered the greater\r\nliability of the very fine holes, necessary for illuminating flames, to\r\nbe choked with dust and dirt. This may, to a great exent, be obviated\r\nby using very small union jets, and setting them horizontally, so as\r\nto make a flat horizontal sheet of flame. Burners placed this way are\r\npractically safe from the interference of falling dust or dirt, but not\r\nfrom splashes. Falling dirt or splashes must always be considered in the\r\narrangement of any burners, and the ventilation must be no greater than\r\nis absolutely necessary for the required work. In cooking, this limit\r\nof ventilation may be exceeded, as most things are better cooked with a\r\nfree ventilation, the extra cost of fuel being well compensated for by\r\nthe better quality of the result.\r\n\r\nThe air in an oven or inclosed space heated by flames inside is similar\r\nin character to highly superheated steam. It contains a large proportion\r\nof moisture, and yet has the power of drying any substance which is\r\nheated to near its own temperature. A mass of cold metal placed in\r\nthe oven is instantly bedewed with moisture, which dries up as the\r\ntemperature of the metal rises. This is, for many purposes, an\r\nobjection, and the remedy is to close the bottom of the oven and place\r\nburners underneath. If for drying purposes and a current of air is\r\nnecessary, the simplest way is to place in the bottom of oven the a\r\nnumber of tubes hanging downward in such a position that the heat of the\r\nflame acts both on the bottom of the oven and the sides of the tubes,\r\nwhich, of course, must be long enough for the lower opening to be well\r\nbelow the level of the flame. The exit may be at any level, but for\r\ndrying purposes it is better at the top, and it should be controlled\r\nby a damper to prevent cooling by excessive currents of air. If not\r\notherwise objectionable, the arrangement of flames inside the oven is\r\nfar the most economical in use.\r\n\r\nWhere an oven or drying chamber is used continuously, it should be\r\njacketed with slag wool or boiler composition, but for many purposes\r\nthis is no advantage. As an example both ways, I will instance the\r\ndrying of founders' cores where there is only one blow per day. The\r\ncores of an ordinary foundry can be dried by gas in a common sheet iron\r\neven in about half an hour; any accumulation of heat after that time\r\nwould be useless, and a jacketed oven would be of no advantage.\r\n\r\nFor the disinfection of clothes in vagrant wards and hospitals for\r\ninfectious diseases, on the contrary, a continued heat is necessary, and\r\nin this case the accumulation of reserve heat, which takes place slowly\r\nin a jacketed oven, becomes of value, as the gas can be turned low or\r\nout, and the ventilators closed, insuring a more complete disinfection\r\nwith a much smaller gas consumption. Where an oven or heated chamber is\r\nmuch used for periods of over half an hour at once, a non-conducting\r\ncasing pays well by reduced gas consumption.\r\n\r\nFor albumen and glue drying, leather enameling, tobacco drying, and\r\npurposes where a large space has to be very slightly and equally warmed\r\nwhen the weather is unfavorable, steam-pipes are generally used, but,\r\nnot being always available, an exceedingly good arrangement may be made\r\nby placing at intervals in the room gas burners, of any construction,\r\nclose to the floor, and surrounded with a sheet-iron cylinder, say 2 ft.\r\nor 3 ft. high. The top of these cylinders must be connected throughout\r\nwith a fairly large flue, which will take the products of combustion\r\nfrom the whole, and this flue must be carried either horizontally, or\r\nwith a slight rise, so as to utilize all the waste heat. The reason for\r\nhaving a number of stoves at intervals is that the heat in a flue will\r\nnot carry, for any useful purpose, more than about 8 ft. or 10 ft., and\r\na single stove would give an irregular temperature in any except a very\r\nsmall room. If all are not used at once, the flues of those not in use\r\nmay be closed by a damper to prevent down draught. The use of hot water\r\npipes heated by gas may also be occasionally advisable, but, unless for\r\nsome special reason, it is much more economical to use coal or coke, as\r\nthe bulk of water makes an exceedingly good regulator, and makes a fire\r\npractically as steady and reliable as gas, thus superseding the more\r\ncostly fuel.\r\n\r\nFor one of my own purposes I need hot-water pipes, having very little\r\nvariation in temperature night and day; and using coke for economy's\r\nsake, I get a regular temperature by heating a large quantity of water,\r\nabout 200 gallons, with the fire, and inclosing this in a tank jacketed\r\nwith slag wool. My circulating pipes run from this tank, and a\r\npractically steady temperature, night and day, can be obtained with the\r\nmost irregular firing, and occasional extinction of the fire for several\r\nhours at once.\r\n\r\nFor the heating of liquids, the greatest economy is to be obtained\r\nfrom one single flame, of as high a temperature as can conveniently be\r\nobtained, and the flame must be in actual contact with the vessel to be\r\nheated. In jacketing vessels, to prevent draughts, care must be taken\r\nthat the jackets do not cause currents of cold air to rise rapidly up\r\nthe sides of the vessel, and so cool it. If this is the case, the use of\r\na jacket, instead of being an economy, is a positive expense, and waste\r\nof heat. Many processes, such as making oil and turpentine varnishes,\r\nrequire a heat under instant control, and in these the use of gas is an\r\nimportant matter, as the loss and risk of fire are very serious elements\r\nof expense, more especially in small works where special and costly\r\npreparations for contingencies cannot be afforded. I have here a burner\r\nwhich, for its power, is, perhaps, the most compact and gives the\r\nhighest temperature of any burner yet known, and it is easily made in\r\nalmost any size; it has, I think, many special advantages. The use of\r\ngauze, which is its only weak point, is more than compensated for by the\r\nvery high duties obtained in practice with it, owing to the compactness\r\nand concentration of the heat obtained. The following extract from my\r\ncommunication to the Gas Institute will give all particulars as to the\r\nconstructive detail of this burner. Those who wish to go further into\r\nthe matter will find the paper referred to in the publication of the\r\nGas Institute for the current year, and also in the _Journal of Gas\r\nLighting_, June 26, 1883, and the _Review of Gas and Water Engineering_,\r\nJune 16, 1883.\r\n\r\n\"The first and most important part is the mixing chamber or tube, one\r\nend of which is supplied separately with gas and air, which at the other\r\nend are, or should be, delivered as a perfect mixture. It may be taken\r\nas a rule that this tube, if horizontal, should not be less in length\r\nthan four and a half times or more than six times its diameter. It is\r\na common practice to diminish or make conical-shaped tubes. All my\r\nexperience goes to prove that, excepting a very trifling allowance for\r\nfriction, the area of the smallest part of the tube rules the power, the\r\nvalue of the mixing-tube being no more than that of the smallest part.\r\nIf the mixing-tube is upright, new sources of interference comes in;\r\nnotably the varying specific gravity of the mixture. Except with one\r\ndefinite gas supply, the result is always more or less imperfect, and\r\nregular proportions cannot be obtained. This is now so well known that\r\nthe upright form has been practically discarded for many years, and\r\nis now only used where the peculiar necessities of the case give some\r\nspecial advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. SPECIAL HIGH POWER BURNER. SHEWING ATTACHMENT B\r\nWHEN USED WITH A BLAST OF AIR]\r\n\r\n\"The diameter of the mixing tube is a matter of importance, as it\r\nrules the quantity of gas which can be satisfactorily burnt in any\r\narrangement. With large flames, given a certain size of gas-jet, the\r\ndiameter of the mixing-tube should be not less than ten times as great.\r\nFor instance, at 1 inch pressure, a jet having a bore of 1/8 inch will\r\npass about 20 cubic feet of gas per hour. To burn this quantity of gas,\r\na mixing tube is necessary 10/8 or 1¼ inch in diameter. By the first\r\nrule this tube must be in length equal to four and a half times its\r\ndiameter, or 5-5/8 inches. It would appear that the mixing-tube, having\r\n100 times the area of the gas jet, is out of all proportion to the size\r\nnecessary for obtaining a mixture of one of gas to nine or ten of air;\r\nbut it must be remembered that the gas is supplied under pressure. It is\r\ntherefore evident that no mere calculation of areas can be taken,\r\ninto account, unless the difference in pressure of the supply is also\r\nconsidered. A complete reversal of this law is shown in that ruling the\r\nconstruction of blowpipes, which I have already given in a previous\r\npaper on 'The Use and Construction of the Blowpipe.' In these the air\r\nsupply, being under a heavier pressure, is much smaller in area than\r\nthe gas inlet; and, to obtain maximum power, the air-jet requires to be\r\nenlarged in proportion to the gas pressure.\r\n\r\n\"Given a certain area of tube delivering a combustible mixture, the\r\noutlet for this mixture must be neither more nor less than the size of\r\nthe tube. Taking an ordinary drilled tube, such as is commonly made, and\r\nof the dimensions before given--i. e., 1¼ inch bore--if the holes are\r\ndrilled 1/8 inch in diameter the tube will supply 10 x 10 = 100 of these\r\nholes. In practice this rule may be modified.\r\n\r\n\"The variations from the rule, however, must be a matter of experience\r\nwith each form of burner. There is also the fact that with small divided\r\nflames it is not necessary to mix so large a proportion of air, as each\r\nflame will take up air, on its external surface; but in this case the\r\nflames are longer, hollow, and of lower temperature. As a matter of\r\nactual practice, where a burner is used which gives a number of flames\r\nor jets, the diameter of the mixing-tube does not need to exceed eight\r\ntimes the diameter of the gas jet; the remainder of the air required\r\nbeing taken up by the surfaces of the flames.\r\n\r\n\"Wire gauze, made of wire the thickness of 22 iron wire gauge, 20 wires\r\nto the linear inch, and tinned after weaving, has an area in the holes\r\nof ¼ its surface. By calculation, the area of a gauze surface in a\r\nburner should, therefore, be taken at four times that of the tube, and\r\nour standard of 1¼ inch tube requires a gauze surface of 2½ inches in\r\ndiameter. This rule is subject to variation in burners of a small size,\r\nowing to the air that can, if required, be taken up by the external\r\nsurface of the flame, which, of course, is much greater in proportion in\r\na small flame than in a large one. Where the diameter of the gauze is,\r\nsay, not over one or two inches, the theoretical maximum gas supply may\r\nbe exceeded, and a varying compensation is necessary with each size.\r\nMy rule is intended to apply to burners of larger diameters, where the\r\nexternal air supply plays a comparatively unimportant part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n\"It must be remembered that burners of this class, which burn without\r\nthe necessity of an external air supply in a flame which is solid,\r\nrequire the mixture to be correct in proportions. A very slight\r\nvariation makes an imperfect flame. Not only does the gas jet require\r\nto be adjusted with great precision, but it also needs more or less\r\nadjustment for different qualities of gas. An ordinary hollow or divided\r\nflame is able to take up on its surface any deficiency of air supply;\r\nbut with the high power solid flames the outside surface is small, and\r\nthe consequence is that one of these burners, adjusted for gas of poor\r\nquality, may, when used with rich gas, give a long hollow or smoky\r\nflame, unless the gas jet be reduced in size. When perfect, the flame\r\nshows a film of green on the surface of the gauze; and if a richer gas\r\nis used, the green film lifts away. To cause this to fall again, and to\r\nproduce a solid flame, it is necessary to take out the gas jet, and\r\ntap the end with a hammer until, on trial, it is found correct. If too\r\nsmall, the green film lies so closely as to make the gauze red hot.\r\nWhere the 'tailing up' of the carbonic oxide flame is objectionable,\r\nthere is no practical difficulty whatever in constructing these burners\r\nas a ring, with an air supply in the center, which greatly reduces the\r\nlength of the 'tail.' In practice it is a decided advantage to have a\r\ncenter air-way in all burners of more than about 2 in. diameter, as it\r\nenables the injecting tube to be slightly shortened, and lessens the\r\nliability of the green film to lift with varying qualities of gas. In\r\nthis class of burner I have adopted the small central air-way as a\r\ndecided improvement in the burners.\"\r\n\r\nIn such processes as the roasting of coffee, chiccory, grain, etc., a\r\ndiffused heat is necessary, but of much greater intensity than can be\r\nobtained with economy from heated air. In these cases the application of\r\na direct flame is necessary, and it may be in actual contact with the\r\nsubstances to be heated, provided these are kept in constant and rapid\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe use of a revolving cylinder brings in complications with any burner\r\nwhich is supplied with gas at ordinary pressures without any artificial\r\nair supply, as the currents of air caused by the motion of the cylinder\r\ninterfere with the satisfactory working of any burner; and the air\r\nsupply must be either protected from draughts and irregular air\r\ncurrents, or the air must be applied artificially from some independent\r\nsource. One exceedingly good way of making any burner work,\r\nindependently of the currents caused by a revolving cylinder, is to\r\napply the flame inside the cylinder at the center, making the substances\r\nto be heated to fall in a continuous stream through the flame. This\r\nsystem is not applicable to fine powders or sticky substances, as it\r\nnecessitates the perforation of the cylinder, to allow of the escape of\r\nproducts of combustion.\r\n\r\nFor this class of work, a very concentrated heat is not desirable, as a\r\nrule, and a slit or a perforated burner is preferable. Of this class of\r\nburner I have here a sample, which is not only new in its constructive\r\ndetails, but has great and special advantages for many purposes. As\r\nyou see, it resembles a number of ordinary furnace bars, with this\r\ndifference, that each bar is a burner; in fact, it is an ordinary\r\nfurnace grate, which supplies its own fuel. With the usual day pressure\r\nof gas=1 inch of water, this burner will, at its maximum power, consume\r\nabout 100 cubic feet of gas per hour per square foot of burner surface,\r\nand as it can readily be made almost any form or size, its adaptability\r\nfor a great number of uses is evident. I have made it in many sizes and\r\nshapes, to give flames from ½ inch wide by 5 feet long to large square\r\nor oblong blocks. By applying a blast of air at the ordinary gas jets,\r\nand supplying the gas by a separate pipe, or series of pipes, below\r\nthe open end of the burner, this can be converted into a furnace of\r\nextraordinary power. It is quite possible to burn as much as 2,000 cubic\r\nfeet of gas per hour per square foot of burner surface, producing a heat\r\nsufficient to fuse any ordinary crucible. You see its power when I place\r\na bundle of iron wire in the flame; it is, in fact, a concentration of\r\nhundreds or thousands of powerful blowpipe flames in one mass. It has\r\nalso this advantage, that with a blast of air it will burn and work\r\nequally well any side up, and the flames can therefore be directed\r\nstraight on their work without loss. It is, in one form or another,\r\nalmost a universal burner, as it can be readily adapted to almost any\r\npurpose, from tempering a row of needles to making steam for a 200 horse\r\npower steam engine. It is easy to make, easy to manage, practically\r\nindestructible, and for commercial purposes has, I think, a general\r\nadaptability which will bring it, in one form or another, into almost\r\nuniversal use. I may say that when we are in a special fix, this has in\r\nevery case landed us out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nFor heating large plates of metal equally, for drying paper impressions\r\nfor stereotypers, hot pressing hosiery, crumpet baking, working up\r\nplastic masses which can only be worked hot, and work of this class, a\r\nnumber of separate flames equally diffused under the whole surface of\r\nthe plate are necessary to equalize the heat, unless the plate is very\r\nthick, and these are better if produced by a mixture of gas and air; but\r\nin heating wide plates one difficulty must always be remembered, the\r\nburnt gases from the center flames can only escape by passing over the\r\nouter flames, and therefore a space must be left between the top of the\r\nflame and the plate, or the outer flames will be smothered and make a\r\nmost offensive smell.\r\n\r\nIn hosiery presses, printers' arming presses, and many others, the top\r\nplate also requires to be heated. The best way to do this is to use a\r\nnumber of blowpipe flames directed downward. In many cases the supply\r\nof air under pressure is a practical difficulty and objection. This is\r\novercome, to a certain extent, by the use of a thick upper plate with a\r\nnumber of horizontal holes, into which a Bunsen flame is directed. In\r\nevery case I have seen, without one single exception, the holes are\r\neither too small, or the burner is placed too close, and the consequence\r\nis that the gas, instead of burning inside the holes, as it should,\r\npasses through partially unburnt, and is consumed at the opposite end,\r\nwhere it is absolutely useless, the flame not being in contact with or\r\nunder the surface to be heated, and therefore doing no work. In hosiery\r\npresses this is a great objection, as the holes are so long that an\r\nequal heat is simply impossible, and the only remedy is to use a\r\nblowpipe flame, which forces sufficient air in with the gas to insure\r\ncombustion where the heat is necessary. The same remark applies to crape\r\nand embossing rollers.\r\n\r\nFor the production of heat in confined spaces and difficult position,\r\nthe use of an artificial blast of air is becoming an acknowledged\r\nnecessity, and the small Roots blowers now made for such purposes, and\r\ndriven by power, are coming rapidly into use.\r\n\r\nSometimes a plate is required to be heated to a high temperature in one\r\nconfined spot, and, as an example of this, I may take the bluing of the\r\nhands of watches. For this purpose I have made several arrangements,\r\nand perhaps the best is a thin copper plate, bent down at one side to a\r\nright angle. In this angle, underneath, is directed a very fine blowpipe\r\nflame on one spot, and the hands are passed singly over this spot until\r\nthe color comes, when they are instantly pushed over the edge. I have\r\nhere the arrangement which is generally used for this purpose. For the\r\nbluing of clock hands, a larger and more equally heated surface is\r\nrequired, and this can be obtained by a small powerful burner without\r\na blast of air, using a rather thicker plate to equalize the heat. The\r\nsame arrangement may be used with advantage for tempering small cutters\r\nfor ornamental turning, penknife-blades, etc., and in these cases the\r\ncooler part of the plate is of great value, as it enables the thicker\r\nparts to be slowly and equally heated up; the application of a\r\nmechanical arrangement to pass the articles to be heated in a regular\r\nsuccession is a matter easily managed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. BLUEING WATCH HANDS & TEMPERING SMALL TOOLS]\r\n\r\nAmong other things which have several times come under my notice may be\r\nmentioned cremation furnaces, but I have not yet met, with, or been\r\nable to devise, any burner for ordinary coal gas which has worked\r\nsatisfactorily. This fuel is apparently unfitted for the work, and\r\nthe best arrangement I know is a number of pipes delivering ordinary\r\n\"producer\" gas from the Wilson or Dowson generators, in exactly the\r\nsame way as is at present used for firing horizontal steam boilers. For\r\nheating book finishers' tools, a ring-flame is the simplest, the tools\r\nbeing supported a little distance above the flame; the usual plan of\r\nheating a plate, and placing the ends of the tools on this, necessitates\r\nat least double the gas consumption as compared with an open flame.\r\nFor type-founding machines, bullet moulding, stereotype metal melting,\r\nsolder making, lead melting, etc., one burner, or rather one flame,\r\nshould be used of a suitable power for the work, and this should be as\r\nperfect and of as high a temperature as possible to insure economy. It\r\nis now a simple matter, owing to recent researches in the theory of\r\nheating burners, to obtain flames of any power without practical limit,\r\nwhich, without any artificial air supply, will do all which is necessary\r\nin this class of work, and the required arrangements are exceedingly\r\nsimple. With these trades may be classed, also, the concentration and\r\ndistillation of acids and liquids boiling at a high temperature, and we\r\nmay also include baths for tinning small articles, and the tinning by\r\nfusion of sheet copper, the same burners being applicable, and perfectly\r\nsuited to all these requirements, unless the tinning baths are long and\r\nnarrow, in which case the furnace-bar burners again come to the front as\r\nthe best; as, if we are to use gas economically, the flame must be the\r\nsame shape as the vessel to be treated.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider the heating of blanks for stamping, hardening the\r\npoints of spindles, finishing the ends of umbrella tips, and work where\r\na small article, or a small part of any article, has to be heated to a\r\nhigh temperature with speed and certainty. For these a long and narrow\r\nflame is necessary, and I may mention that in cases where a high speed\r\nof delivery is required, and a small part only has to be heated, such\r\nas, for instance, in the hardening of the points of spindles for cotton\r\nmachinery, I have made burners giving a flame of exceedingly high\r\ntemperature only ¼ inch wide and five feet long. This flame is produced\r\nby the assistance of a blast of air, and is of sufficiently high\r\ntemperature to fuse the spindle in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThe points only project over the flame, and the spindles are carried\r\nmechanically at such a speed that at the end of the five feet traverse\r\nthey are red hot, and drop into water. More than one hundred are in the\r\nflame at once, lying side by side.\r\n\r\nFor heating blanks for stamping, the furnace bar-burner is perfectly\r\nsuited, and in this work the chute supplying the blanks to the machine\r\nshould be made of two fireclay sides, with an opening for the flame\r\nbetween the chute and flame being placed at a sharp angle, to prevent\r\nrisk of the blanks sticking or overriding each other. A blowpipe may\r\nalso be used with good effect, as shown in the above engraving, and in\r\nmany cases it is preferable and much easier to manage.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the direct contact of the flame would spoil the articles\r\nto be heated, and instead of the arrangement mentioned, a tube of iron,\r\nfireclay, or other suitable material is heated, and the articles are\r\npassed through it. This system of continuous feed, through a tube, has\r\nbeen applied to the firing of small articles of pottery, and might\r\npossibly be well adapted, among other things, to the production of\r\ngas-burners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nWhere the contact of air with the heated articles is injurious, many\r\nplans have been tried to keep the ends closed as much as possible, but I\r\nbelieve no more perfect and simple seal against the admission of air can\r\nbe devised than to turn a jet of pure gas, unmixed with air, into each\r\nend of the tube. This is an absolute seal against the entry of oxygen in\r\nan uncombined state; free oxygen cannot exist at a very high temperature\r\nin the presence of coal gas.\r\n\r\nFor many trades there is a demand for hardened and tempered steel wire,\r\neither round or flattened, and the production of this has led to many\r\nattempts to obtain a satisfactory continuous process. The common method\r\nnow, which is worked as a \"secret\" process by most firms, is to pass\r\nthe wire through a tube to heat it, as already described, and to run it\r\ndirect from the tube through a hole in the side of a box filled with\r\noil, the whole being packed with asbestos, to prevent leakage; from this\r\nit is passed through another similar hole on the opposite side, either\r\nover a plate heated to the right temperature, or over a narrow open\r\nflame of sufficient length and power to give the correct heat for\r\ntempering.\r\n\r\nWhere absolute precision is necessary, the gas supply must be adapted by\r\nan automatic regulator on the main, to prevent the slightest variation\r\nof heat. Once adjusted, the production of flat and round spring wire by\r\nthe mile is an exceedingly simple matter. It is quite possible to obtain\r\nabsolute precision in temperature by a proper adjustment of the gas\r\npressure, and as this is, for tempering steel articles and some other\r\npurposes, a matter of great importance, it is worth some consideration.\r\nNo pressure regulator alone will give an absolutely steady supply; but\r\nif we put on first a regulator, adjusted to the minimum pressure of\r\nsupply, say one inch of water, and then fix another on the same pipe,\r\nadjusted to a slightly lower pressure, say 9/10 of an inch, the first\r\nregulator does the rough adjustment, and the second one will then give\r\nan absolutely steady supply, provided always that the regulators are\r\nboth capable of passing more gas than is likely to be ever required. No\r\nregulator can be relied on for absolute precision, if worked up to its\r\nmaximum possible capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. ARRANGEMENT FOR HEATING BLANKS FOR STAMPING OR\r\nHARDENING.]\r\n\r\nAmong other applications of a long narrow flame of high power, may be\r\nmentioned the brazing of long lengths of tube, in fact the application\r\nof flames of this form, with and without a blast of air, for different\r\ntemperatures, are almost endless.\r\n\r\nThe thousands of uses to which blowpipes are adapted are so well known,\r\nthat they need no mention, except the curiously ignored fact that the\r\npower of any blowpipe depends on the air pressure. A compact flame of\r\nhigh temperature cannot be obtained except with a heavy air pressure,\r\nand the ignorance of this fact has caused an immense number of\r\nunexplained failures. Many people think that one blower is as good as\r\nanother, and expect that a fan giving a pressure equal to, say, the\r\nheight of a two inch column of water should do the same work as a blower\r\ngiving a pressure ten to twenty times as great. The construction and\r\npower of blowpipes, with the laws ruling the proportions and power, will\r\nbe found in an article on \"Blowpipe Construction,\" published in _Design\r\nand Work_, March, 1881, and as the matter is there fully treated, no\r\nfurther reference to the subject is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the more recent forms of gas-engine, the charge is exploded by a\r\nwrought iron tube, heated to redness by the external application of a\r\ngas flame. This, although considered satisfactory by the makers, appears\r\nto me to be an exceedingly crude way of getting over the difficulty; and\r\nI offer it as a suggestion, that a very small platinum tube shall be\r\nused instead of iron. This, if made with a porous or spongy internal\r\ncoating, would fire the charge with certainty, at a lower temperature\r\nthan iron, and it could be made so thin and small in diameter, without\r\nrisk of deterioration or loss of strength, that an exceedingly small\r\nflame could be used to heat it up. As it would be fully heated in a very\r\nfew seconds, the delay in starting would be obviated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nThere are many purposes for which a red heat is needed for slow\r\ncontinuous processes on a small scale, such as case-hardening small\r\nsteel goods, annealing, heating light steel articles for hardening, and\r\na great variety of other similar processes. This, until recently, has\r\nrequired the use either of a rather complicated furnace, or a blast of\r\nair under pressure, to increase the rapidity of combustion. Since the\r\nconclusion of my experiments on the theoretical construction of burners,\r\nI have found that the high-power burners, previously described, are\r\ncapable of heating a crucible equal in size to their own diameter\r\nto bright redness without the assistance of a chimney, provided the\r\ncrucible is protected from draughts by a fireclay cylinder.\r\n\r\nThis is an important point, as it renders the production of a continuous\r\nbright red heat a matter of the greatest ease, even in crucibles of a\r\ncomparatively large size. Where the heat is steady, and certain not to\r\nrise above a definite point, it can safely be used for such purposes as\r\nhardening penknife blades and other articles which are very irregular\r\nin thickness, the thin edges not being liable to be burnt or damaged by\r\noverheating.\r\n\r\nFor the highest temperatures air under pressure is a necessity, as we\r\nrequire a large quantity of gas burnt in as small a space as possible\r\nwith the maximum speed, and given this air supply, we are very little\r\nhampered by conditions, as an explosive mixture may be blown through a\r\ngauze into a fireclay chamber, closed, except so far as is necessary to\r\nallow the escape or burnt gases. The speed of combustion is limited only\r\nby the speed of supply of air and gas, and by increasing these there is\r\nno practical limit to the heat which can be obtained. When we have to\r\ndo with the reduction of samples of refractory ores, testing the\r\ncomparative fusibility of different samples of firebricks, or alloys,\r\netc., the use of an explosive mixture blown into and burning in a\r\nclose chamber is invaluable, and the ease and certainty with which\r\nany temperature may be obtained has led to great discoveries, and the\r\nrevolutionizing of many commercial processes. Recent experiments have\r\nproved that, by a modification in the form of the well-known injector\r\nfurnace, an enormous increase of temperature may be obtained. I have,\r\nin actual work, obtained the fusing point of cast iron in two minutes,\r\nstarting all cold, and have fused every furnace casing I have yet been\r\nable to produce. If infusible casings can be made, I think I am not\r\noverstating facts in saying that any temperature required can and will\r\neventually be obtained with the greatest ease. What the limit is I have\r\nas yet not been able to discover.\r\n\r\nThere is one more application of gas, as a fuel, which, discovered and\r\npublished by myself some two years ago, has yet to become generally\r\nknown, and in some special processes may prove exceedingly valuable.\r\nThis is the addition of a very small quantity or coal gas, or light\r\npetroleum vapors, to the air supplied by a blower or chimney pull,\r\nto furnaces burning coke or charcoal. The instant and great rise in\r\ntemperature of the furnace, and the greater stability of the solid fuel\r\nused, are extraordinary. This is, in fact, a practical application of\r\nthe well-known \"flameless combustion,\" the only signs that the gas\r\nis being burnt being a great rise in temperature and a decreased\r\nconsumption of the solid fuel; in fact, if the gas is in correct\r\nproportion, the solid fuel remains unburnt, or nearly so, in spite of\r\nthe high temperature. In cases where a sudden rise in temperature is\r\nrequired in a furnace, or where the power is deficient, this method\r\nof supplementing and increasing the heat will be found of very great\r\nservice, and processes liable to be checked by making up a fire with\r\nfresh fuel can be carried on without check, even after the solid fuel\r\nhas almost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThat a solid fuel is quite unnecessary, I will prove in a very simple\r\nmanner, by burning a mixture of coal gas and air without a flame, in a\r\nbundle of iron wire. The heat is sufficient to fuse the wrought iron\r\nwith ease, and the glare inside the bundle of wire is painful to the\r\neyes. The same result could be obtained by a pile of red-hot lumps of\r\nfirebrick, and the same heat obtained also without a trace of flame.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to enter fully into such a wide and important subject\r\nin a single lecture, and the suggestions now given are simply hints for\r\nthe guidance for those who need or desire to experiment. No doubt we\r\nshall have, after a time, some text-books and other literature on this\r\nsubject, which is one of great importance to many industries; and it is\r\nnecessary for experimental work and applications to new industries, that\r\nthe experimenter shall not only be able to purchase special burners, but\r\nthat he shall have fundamental laws laid down which will enable him to\r\nconstruct them for himself, so as to have his experiments under his own\r\ncontrol. The difficulty in the way of literature on the subject is that\r\nthose few who have worked in the matter are busy men, with little time\r\nwhich is not already fully employed.\r\n\r\nPioneers on new ground have a great liability to generalize and jump at\r\nconclusions, and the necessary exact work and detail must, to a great\r\nextent, be left to those who follow on tracks already roughly marked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOf the special trades which have come under my observation, I have only\r\nhad time to mention a very few. It appears to me that there are very few\r\nmanufacturing processes of any kind which could not be simplified by the\r\nuse of gas as a fuel, from the production of electric light apparatus\r\nto the manufacture of explosives, cotton stockings, beer, catgut, glue,\r\numbrellas, ink, fish-hook, medals, stained glass windows, brushes, and\r\nother trades equally various, which come daily under my own notice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA man was received into the Laborisière Hospital, Paris, the other day,\r\nwith a yard of rope hanging from his mouth.

So it has seemed to us that it would\r\nbe of interest to treat of a question that is the order of the day. We\r\ndesire to speak of those photographic apparatus called instantaneous\r\nshutters.\r\n\r\nNumerous apparatus of this kind have been proposed to the public, and\r\nseveral even have been described in this journal, but we have to state\r\nthat, despite the success in certain cases, none of them has proved\r\nremarkable for its qualities and superiority. This is due, we believe,\r\nto the fact that inventors, while showing arrangements that were often\r\ningenious, have not always taken into account the end that the shutter\r\nis to subserve, and the qualities that it must possess in order to\r\nattain such end.\r\n\r\nIn face of the progress made by extra rapid dry processes, the question\r\nof shutters has become the most important, since cabinet-making, optics,\r\nand photographic chemistry give us apparatus, objectives, and products\r\nwhich, although they will doubtless be improved upon, satisfy for the\r\npresent all our needs.\r\n\r\nWhat is understood by instantaneousness? To our knowledge, no definition\r\nthereof has as yet been given. For our part, we propose to style\r\n\"instantaneous\" any photograph that is taken in a fraction of a second\r\nthat our senses will not permit us to estimate. The shutter is the\r\napparatus which allows the light to enter the photographic chamber\r\nduring this very short time.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine the different rules that govern the question of\r\nshutters, we shall take as an example the type styled the \"Guillotine.\"\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, as every one knows, is a stiff plate containing an\r\naperture and passing over the line of the rays of light. Some place\r\nit in front and others behind, while others again place it within the\r\nobjective. Let us examine and discuss what occurs in the three cases.\r\nSuppose a rectilinear objective of the kind most usually employed in\r\ninstantaneous photography, and an object, A B, that we wish to reproduce\r\n(Fig. 1), the objective being provided with any sort of diaphragm. The\r\npoint, A, sends a bundle of rays, a\"b\", to the first lens. Here they are\r\nslightly refracted, and then go on parallel lines to the second lens,\r\nwhere they are again refracted and form at A' an image of A. It is this\r\nimage that we see upon the ground glass, and which makes an impression\r\nupon the sensitive film. The point, B, behaves in the same way and\r\ngives an image at B', but, as will be at once seen, the image will be\r\nreversed. In our figure, A corresponds to the sky and B to the earth.\r\nIf, then, the shutter passes in front of the objective, it will first\r\nallow of the passage of the rays which come from the sky, then, on\r\ncontinuing its travel, it will unveil the landscape, and lastly the\r\nground. As it is submitted to the law of the fall of bodies and has a\r\nuniformly increasing velocity, it follows that the time of exposure will\r\nuniformly decrease between A' and B', and that the sky will pose longer\r\nthan the foreground. Such a result is contrary to all photographic\r\nrules, which require that objects shall pose so much the longer the\r\nless they are lighted. This position of the \"guillotine\" shutter is\r\nabsolutely false, and must be altogether discarded. If the shutter be\r\nplaced behind the objective, it will follow, as a consequence of the\r\nsame demonstration, that the time of exposure will go diminishing from\r\nB' to A', and that the foreground will be exposed longer than the sky.\r\nThe solution is logical, then, and will permit of obtaining excellent\r\nnegatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nLet us now examine how the image, A'B', is formed. The point, A, appears\r\nfirst, and becomes lighter and lighter up to the moment at which all the\r\nrays that emanate from the point, A, are unveiled. The point, B', is not\r\nyet visible. As the shutter continues its travel the point, B', appears\r\nin its turn and becomes illuminated like the point, A'. At this moment\r\nthe objective is completely uncovered; the image, A'B', is perfect, and\r\npossesses its maximum intensity. Then the point, A', gradually becomes\r\nobscured and disappears; and the same is the case with all parts of\r\nA'B'. The image is developed progressively from A' to B', and makes its\r\nimpression upon the sensitive plate successively--a fact which, as\r\nmay be conceived, may have its importance. If, for example, we are\r\nphotographing a ship that is being tossed about by the sea (and we\r\nborrow this example from our colleague, Mr. Davanne), the image of the\r\ntop of the mast will not be formed at the same instant as that of the\r\nbase, and if the motion of the mast has sufficient extent it may take on\r\na curved form, due to the fact that it has effected a movement between\r\nthe moments during which its apex and base were being photographed.\r\n\r\nUpon placing the guillotine shutter in the optical center of the\r\nobjective, what will occur? The shutter will permit the passage of an\r\nequal fraction of the rays derived from A and B, that is to say, the\r\nimage will be complete from the first instant of the exposure. The\r\npoints, A' and B', will be illuminated precisely at the same moment. As\r\nthe shutter continues its travel, a fresh quantity of rays coming from A\r\nand B will be admitted, and the image will be illuminated more and more\r\nup to the moment at which all the rays can pass. It will then possess\r\nits maximum intensity. Then a portion of the rays from A and B being\r\nintercepted, the image will become darker and darker until complete\r\nextinction. The image here, then, is not produced successively as in the\r\nformer case, but is entire from the beginning. In this case the image of\r\nour mast cannot be misshapen, since it has been accurately photographed\r\nat the same moment.\r\n\r\nThe true place for the guillotine shutter, then, from a theoretical\r\nstandpoint, is in the interior of the objective. Are there any other\r\nadvantages to be gained by so placing it? Yes; it is easy to understand\r\nthat for the same time of exposure, and consequently for the same\r\nresult, the aperture may be so much the smaller in proportion as the\r\noptical center is approached.\r\n\r\nThe luminous rays, in fact, form in the objective a double truncated\r\ncone whose upper base is equal to the diaphragm, and the lower one to\r\nthe diameter of the lenses. If the aperture be equal to any diameter\r\nwhatever of one of the cones, the result will be the same; but, for\r\nthe same period of exposure, it will evidently prove advantageous to\r\napproach the diaphragm. The ratio of the apertures that give the same\r\nresults at the optical center or behind the objective is as that of the\r\ndiaphragm employed to that of the back lens. If the diaphragm is\r\none centimeter and the lenses four centimeters, an aperture of one\r\ncentimeter in one case and of four in the other will give the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nWe shall see further along that it is advantageous to employ apertures\r\nequal to several times the diameter of the diaphragm or lens. Now, from\r\nwhat we have just said, an aperture, equal for example to four times the\r\ndiaphragm, will be only 4 centimeters, while the corresponding aperture\r\nbehind the lens must be 16. The dimensions of the first will be\r\npractical, and those of the second will give too cumbersome and too\r\nfragile an apparatus. But why must the aperture be larger than the\r\ndiaphragm employed? This is what we are going to demonstrate. Let us\r\nmake the aperture equal to the diameter of the objective, and see\r\nwhat occurs at the different periods of the exposure. For the sake of\r\nclearness, we shall suppose the velocity uniform.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, _a priori_, that a perfect apparatus will be the one that\r\nwill allow the light to act during the entire exposure with a maximum of\r\nintensity. Is it thus, when the aperture is equal to the diameter of the\r\nobjective? Evidently not. Let us consult Fig. 2. We here see the shutter\r\nprogressively uncovering the objective. The light will increase from A\r\nto C up to the moment when the objective is entirely uncovered, and will\r\nthen immediately decrease up to B. The objective has operated with a\r\nmaximum of light for only a short time. We are far from the ideal result\r\nin which the maximum of light, CD, should exist during the entire\r\nexposure, and form the upper plane precisely equal to AB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf we cannot obtain such a result in practice, we must nevertheless\r\naproximate to it. We shall do so by increasing the shutter. Up to C' the\r\napparatus will operate as before, but from C' to D' the aperture will be\r\ncomplete, and from D' to B' will decrease as has been said.\r\n\r\nLet us give A'B' the same value as AB, that is to say, let us increase\r\nthe velocity in the second case in order that the time of exposure shall\r\nbe the same; we shall at once see that in the first case the object will\r\nbe completely uncovered for only a very short time, while in the second\r\nthe exposure will be perfect for a very appreciable period.\r\n\r\nThe time of exposure which is absolutely active, we propose to call\r\neffective time of exposure in contradistinction to the total time of the\r\nsame. The more we increase the value of C'D', that is to say, that of\r\nthe effective time, the more the ratio, C'D'/A'B', will approximate to\r\nunity, and the nearer we shall reach perfection. The correlative of such\r\nelongation of the aperture is an increase in velocity which will always\r\nbring the total exposure to the same figure, whatever be the aperture\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nIf the aperture be equal to two diameters, the effective time will be\r\nequal to half the time of the total exposure; and if it is equal to\r\nthree diameters, the exposure will be good during 2/3 of the total time.\r\nThis amounts to saying that the effective time of exposure is equal to n\r\ntimes the diameter--1, the velocity being supposed always uniform. If\r\nwe place the shutter within the objective, it is the diameter of the\r\ndiaphragm that it will be necessary to say. The effective time will be\r\nequal then to n diaphragm--1.\r\n\r\nFrom what precedes it results that in no case should the aperture be\r\ninferior to the diaphragm, since the former would otherwise absolutely\r\nsuppress the effective time in giving a lower plane corresponding to\r\nan insufficient quantity of light. Moreover, an aperature of this kind\r\nwould prove injurious to the quality of the image by successively\r\nuncovering rays which do not form their image identically at the same\r\npoint. We are now, then, in presence of results that are absolutely\r\npositive, and they are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The guillotine shutter should be placed in the interior of the\r\nobjective and as near as possible to optical center, that is to say,\r\nbehind the diaphragm, since the latter is precisely in the optical\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n2. The aperture should be as wide as possible.\r\n\r\n3. The velocity should be as great as possible.\r\n\r\nIn practice, an aperture from 4 to 5 times the diameter of diaphragm\r\nemployed will be more than sufficient, since we shall have, according to\r\ncircumstances, ¾ or 4/5 of the effective time. Moreover, whatever be the\r\ntime of exposure, this ratio once established will be invariable, and\r\nthe apparatus will always operate identically.\r\n\r\nA shutter combining these qualities will not yet be perfect. It is\r\nnecessary, according to the time and the light, that the time of\r\nexposure shall be capable of being varied. In a word, it is necessary\r\nthat the apparatus shall be _graduated_ and permit of taking views more\r\nor less quickly. The different velocities might be given to the\r\nshutter by means of weights, rubber, or springs. The latter seem to be\r\npreferable, since they permit in the first place of operating out of\r\nthe vertical; moreover, they are less fragile, and, through different\r\ntensions, they permit of these graduations that we consider as\r\nindispensable. For the current needs of practice 1/100 of a second is a\r\nlimit that seems to us sufficient as a maximum of rapidity. In order to\r\nknow the time of exposure obtained we employ the following method, which\r\npermits of graduating an apparatus rapidly and with extreme precision:\r\n\r\nA band of smoked paper is fixed upon the shutter, then a tuning-fork\r\nprovided with a small stylet resting against the paper is made to\r\nvibrate. Better yet, a chronograph which vibrates synchronously with a\r\ntuning-fork, whose motion is kept up by electricity, is put in the same\r\nplace. Fig. 3 shows the arrangement to be employed. We then let the\r\nshutter fall, when the little stylet will inscribe a certain number of\r\nvibrations. Knowing the number of vibrations of the tuning-fork, and\r\ncounting the number of those inscribed upon the paper, it is very simple\r\nto deduce therefrom the amount of the time of exposure. The results of\r\none of these experiments we have reproduced in Fig. 4. The tuning-fork\r\ngave 100 double vibrations per second. Six vibrations are included\r\nbetween the opening and closing of the apparatus. Each vibration\r\nestimated at 1/100 of a second. The exposure was 6/100 of a second in\r\nround numbers. This is the amount of the total time of exposure. As\r\nfor that of the effective time, that is just as easily ascertained. It\r\nsuffices to know the number of vibrations comprised between the moment\r\nat which one point of the objective has been completely uncovered and\r\nthat at which it has begun to be covered again. The time is equal to\r\n2/100 in round numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment in question, with an aperture equal to twice the\r\ndiameter of the diaphragm, we have, then, 1/3 of the half-open exposure;\r\nand the amount of the effective time is 1/3. The difference that we\r\nhave in practice is due to the fact that the velocity is uniformly\r\naccelerated. In order to increase the amount of the effective time, it\r\nwill be only necessary to increase the aperture of the shutter and apply\r\nagain the method that we have just pointed out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nSo much for the material part of the apparatus. It will be necessary\r\nin addition to acquire sufficient individual experience to be able to\r\nestimate the intensity of the light, and consequently to judge of the\r\ndiaphragm to be employed and the velocity to be obtained. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that such or such an object having a relatively slow speed\r\nwill not be sufficiently sharp on the negative if it is too near\r\nthe apparatus, while such or such another, much more rapid, might\r\nnevertheless be caught if sufficient distance intervened. Here it is\r\nthat will appear the skill of the amateur, who will find it possible to\r\nobtain the said object as large as possible and with a maximum degree of\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\nWe have seen what diverse qualities should be possessed by a good\r\nguillotine shutter, and it is evident that the same should be found\r\nin all apparatus of the kind. In our opinion the guillotine is a well\r\ndefined type that possesses one capital advantage, and that is that it\r\npermits of the use of aperatures as wide as may be desired for the\r\nsame time of exposure. It is a question, as we have seen, of velocity.\r\nConsequently, however short the exposure be, it will always be possible\r\nto operate with a full amount of light during the greater part of the\r\nexposure. It is necessary to dwell upon this point, since in another\r\nkind of apparatus that possesses a closing and opening shutter the same\r\nresult cannot be reached. In the Boca apparatus, for instance, we remark\r\nthat at a given moment the time of exposure is reduced to nothing, as\r\nthe closing shutter covers the objective before the latter has been\r\nunmasked by the opening one. In all exposures, in fact, the times of\r\nopening and closing have a constant value. It follows that the shorter\r\nthe exposure is, the greater becomes such value, and to such a point\r\nthat, at a given moment, the apparatus no longer make an exposure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn the guillotine, on the contrary, the same space always intervenes\r\nbetween the time of opening and closing, since it is fixed in an\r\nunvarying manner by the diameter at the aperature. Then, the greater the\r\nvelocity, the more the time of opening and closing diminishes. If\r\nthe ratio of the effective to the total time of exposure is 3/4, for\r\nexample, it will be invariable, whatever be the velocity.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, we will remark that, without employing springs, we\r\nmay increase the aperture of the shutter without varying the time of\r\nexposure. To effect this it is only necessary to raise the point of the\r\nshutter's drop. In fact, as may be seen in Fig. 4, all the vibrations\r\nof the stylet corresponding to 1/100 of a second always continue to\r\nelongate, and it will consequently be possible for the same time of\r\nexposure to considerably increase the aperture and, as a consequence,\r\nthe effective time, by causing the guillotine to drop from a greater\r\nelevation. From this study, which has principally concerned the\r\nguillotine shutter, can we draw the deduction that this type of\r\napparatus will become a definite one? We think not. In fact, along with\r\nits decided advantages the guillotine has a few defects that cannot be\r\npassed over in silence. The aperture, in measure as it is increased,\r\nrenders the apparatus delicate and subject to become bent. If, in order\r\nto obviate this trouble, we employ plates of steels, we increase its\r\nweight considerably, and the chamber becomes subject to vibration at the\r\nmoment the shutter drops. If rubber or springs are used for increasing\r\nthe velocity, it is still worse. Moreover, it is quite difficult to\r\nobtain a graduation, and to our knowledge, and probably for this reason,\r\nit has not yet been applied.\r\n\r\nThe reader will please excuse us for this perhaps somewhat dry\r\ntheoretical _expose_, but we have thought it well to give it in the\r\nhope that it might well show the qualities that should be required of a\r\nphotographic shutter and particularly of the guillotine. Moreover, at\r\nthe point to which photography has arrived it is no longer permitted to\r\ndo things by halves.\r\n\r\nAfter the memorable discoveries of Nicephore, Niepce, Daguerre, and\r\nTalbot, photography remained for some time stationary, limited to the\r\nproduction of portraits and landscapes. But for a few years past it has\r\ntaken a new impetus, and new processes have come to the surface. In the\r\ngraphic arts and in the sciences it has taken considerable place. Being\r\nthe daughter of chemistry and physics, it is not astonishing that we\r\nrequire of it the precision of both. It is, moreover, through a profound\r\nstudy of the reactions that gave it birth and through a knowledge of the\r\nlaws of optics that it has come into current use in laboratories. In\r\nfact, it alone is capable of giving with an undoubted character of\r\ntruthfulness a durable vestige of certain fleeting phenomena.--\r\n\r\n_A.

The inverted siphon is subject\r\nto obstruction and choking up in its most inaccessible parts, while\r\nthe upright siphon is easy of inspection, taking apart, etc. But, _per\r\ncontra_, the latter loses its priming very easily by reason of the\r\nformation of air spaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FALCONETTI'S SIPHON.]\r\n\r\nMr. Falconetti, an inspector of bridges and roadways, has found a means\r\nof rendering the latter occurrence impossible by an arrangement which\r\nis both simple and practical, and which is illustrated herewith. In the\r\nfigure, a and b are the two vertical legs of the siphon, both of which\r\nenter the liquid. These open into the receptacles, c and d, in which the\r\ncocks, e and f, cut off or set up a communication with the pipes, a\r\nand b. These latter are connected by a branch, g, which may be put in\r\ncommunication with a reservoir, h, that is divided into two superposed\r\ncompartments by a partition, i. Such communication may be established\r\nor cut off by a valve, j, maneuvered by a key, k, which traverses\r\nan aperture in the partition, i. Another aperture, m, in this same\r\npartition serves to put the two parts of the reservoir, h, in\r\ncommunication, and, for this purpose, is provided with a cock, n, which\r\nis easily maneuvered from the exterior.\r\n\r\nThe object of this arrangement of cocks and reservoir is to prevent the\r\nsiphon from losing its priming through the possible presence in the\r\ntransverse portion of a certain quantity of air or gas that might be\r\ngiven off by the water and accumulate in this place.\r\n\r\nThe compartment, A, of the reservoir, h, is designed for receiving the\r\ngases that collect in the top of the siphon, while the upper compartment\r\ncontains water for making a hydraulic joint, and consequently preventing\r\nany re-entrance of air through the apertures in the partition, i.\r\n\r\nTo prime the siphon, we shut the cocks, e and f, open the valves, j and\r\nm, and pour in water until the whole affair (siphon and reservoir) is\r\nfull; then we close the cock, m, and open the three others. The siphon\r\nthus becomes primed, and begins to operate as soon as any water reaches\r\none or the other of the lower receptacles. As the cock, j, is constantly\r\nturned on during the operation of the siphon, the air that has been able\r\nto accumulate in the lower compartment, A, of the reservoir, h, would\r\nfinally unprime the siphon by intercepting communication between its two\r\nlegs. In order to prevent such a thing from occurring, it suffices to\r\nexpel the air, from time to time, that accumulates in the chamber,\r\nA, this being done, without stopping the operation of the siphon, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAfter closing the cock, j, water is poured into the reservoir, and,\r\nrunning down to the lower compartment, drives out the air through the\r\ncock, m. This operation once effected, it only remains to turn off the\r\ncock, m, again, and open j in order to establish the normal operation.\r\nAs the chamber, A, is provided externally with a water gauge, N, it may\r\nbe seen at a glance when it is necessary to maneuver the cocks in order\r\nto expel the air.\r\n\r\nThis system of siphon is evidently applicable to all sorts of liquids.\r\nIt may likewise undergo a few modifications in its construction; for\r\nexample, the valve, which in our engraving is placed over the siphon,\r\nmay be located at any distance from the apparatus, although it should,\r\nin all cases, be in constant communication with it by means of a tube,\r\nand be placed a little higher than the siphon. It may then be put under\r\ncover and be kept constantly in sight, thus greatly facilitating its\r\nsurveillance.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, the essential peculiarity of this improvement consists\r\nin the very ingenious arrangement that permits of immersing the cocks in\r\nthe liquid to make them perfectly tight, it being necessary that they\r\nshould be hermetically closed in order to prevent the entrance of air\r\nto the siphon. Everything leads to the belief, then, that if upright\r\nsiphons have never been able to operate regularly, it has been because\r\nno means have been known of expelling the air from the interior without\r\nletting air from the exterior enter at the same time. The arrangement\r\ndevised by Mr. Falconetti gets over the difficulty in a very elegant\r\nmanner. It seems as if it would be called upon to render great services\r\nin the industries, and it well merits the attention of engineers\r\nof roads and bridges, and of contractors on public works.--_Revue\r\nIndustrielle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEIBEL-PICCARD SYSTEM OF EVAPORATING LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the industries, there are often considerable quantities of liquid to\r\nbe evaporated in order to concentrate it. Such evaporation is very often\r\nperformed by burning fuel in sufficient quantity to furnish the liquid\r\nthe heat necessary to convert it into steam. This process is attended\r\nwith a consumption of fuel such as to form a very important factor in\r\nthe cost of the product to be obtained. In order to vaporize, at the\r\npressure of the atmosphere, 1 kilogramme of water at 0°, 637 heat units\r\nare required, and of these, 100 are employed in raising the water from\r\n0° to 100° and 537 in converting the water at 100° into steam at 100°.\r\nThis second quantity is called the _latent heat_ of the steam at 100°.\r\nThe sum of the two quantities is called the _total heat_ of the steam at\r\n100°. The total heat of the steam remains nearly constant, whatever be\r\nthe temperature at which the vaporization occurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WEIBEL-PICCARD EVAPORATION APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIn order to utilize the steam as a means of heating, it is necessary to\r\ncondense it, that is to say, to cause it to pass from the gaseous to a\r\nliquid state. This conversion disengages as much heat as the passage\r\nfrom the liquid to the gaseous state had absorbed.\r\n\r\nIt results from this that if we could condense the steam that is given\r\noff by a liquid that we are vaporizing, in contact with another liquid\r\nthat it is also a question of vaporizing, we should utilize all the heat\r\ncontained in the steam that was being given off from the first.\r\n\r\nThis object can be practically attained by two means, viz., by (1)\r\nputting the disengaged steam in contact with the sides of a vessel that\r\ncontains a liquid colder than the one that produced it; (2) by raising\r\nthe temperature and pressure of the disengaged steam in order to\r\ncondense it in contact with the sides of the vessel which contains the\r\nvery liquid that has produced it.\r\n\r\nThe first of these means is realized in the apparatus called multiple\r\nacting, that are at present so generally employed in sugar works. The\r\nsecond means, which permits of a greater saving in fuel being made than\r\nthe other does, is realized by compressing the disengaged steam. This\r\ncompression, which raises the temperature and pressure of the steam,\r\npermits of condensing the latter in contact with the vessel wherein it\r\nhas been produced. By such condensation we continuously restore to the\r\nliquid which is being vaporized the heat of the steam which it gives\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThis solution of the question, which has been partially seen at\r\ndifferent epochs, has but recently made its way into the industries. It\r\nis being operated at present with complete success at the salt works of\r\nFrance and Switzerland, at those of Austria and Prussia, in the sugar\r\nof milk factories of France and Switzerland, and, finally, in 1882, the\r\nfirst application of it in the sugar industry was made at Pohrlitz, in\r\nMoravia.\r\n\r\nThe saving of fuel that has been made in these different applications\r\nhas always been great.\r\n\r\nWe shall now, for the sake of explaining the system, give a brief\r\ndescription of the apparatus as used at the Pohrlitz sugar works\r\nmentioned above. These works treat 255 tons of beets per 24 hours, and\r\nobtain 4,000 hectoliters of juice, which is reduced to about 1,000\r\nhectoliters of sirup. Up to the present, the concentration has been\r\neffected in a double acting apparatus partly supplied by exhaust steam\r\nfrom the motive engines and partly by steam coming directly from the\r\ngenerators.\r\n\r\nIn order to diminish the consumption of direct steam, these sugar works\r\nput in a Weibel-Piccard apparatus designed to concentrate only a third\r\nof their juice, or about 1,350 hectoliters per day.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus (see engraving) consists of a steam compressor, 0.835 m.\r\nin diameter, actuated directly by a driving cylinder of 0.5 m. diameter\r\nand 0.8 m. stroke, and of three evaporating boilers of the ordinary\r\nvertical tube type, the first of which has a surface of 150 square\r\nmeters, the second 60, and the third 80.\r\n\r\nThe steam, at the ordinary pressure of the generators, say 5\r\natmospheres, is taken from the connected generators of the works, and is\r\nled to the driving cylinder, where it expands and furnishes the power\r\nnecessary to run the compressor. It then escapes at a pressure of l.4\r\natmospheres and enters the intertubular space of the first evaporator.\r\nThe compressor sucks up the steam from the juice of the first evaporator\r\n(which is boiling at the pressure of the atmosphere, without vacuum or\r\neffective pressure), compresses it to 1.4 atmospheres, and forces it\r\nlikewise into the intertubular space. The ebullition of the first\r\nevaporator, then, is kept up not only by the exhaust from the motive\r\ncylinder, but also by the steam from the juice itself, which has been\r\nrendered fit to serve as a heating steam by the pressure that it has\r\nundergone in the compressing cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn this first application of the new system to sugar making, it became\r\na question of ascertaining whether the advantage resulting from\r\ncompression was of great importance, and, in the second place, whether\r\nthe apparatus could be run with certainty and ease. In truth, the\r\napplications of the system for some years past in other industries\r\npermitted a favorable result to be hoped for, and the result turned out\r\nas was expected.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus it has been found that the work furnished by one\r\nkilogramme of steam passing through the motive cylinder, from a\r\npressure of 5 atmospheres to one of 1.4, is sufficient to compress 2.5\r\nkilogrammes of steam taken from the juice, led into the compressor\r\nat one atmosphere and escaping therefrom at 1.4. In other words, one\r\nkilogramme of motive steam is sufficient to convert into heating steam\r\nfor the first evaporator 2.5 kilogrammes of steam taken from the juice\r\nin this same evaporator. Besides, this same kilogramme of motive steam\r\nproduces three effects, one in this same evaporator, and the other\r\ntwo in the two succeeding ones. The effect obtained, then, from one\r\nkilogramme of motive steam is, in round numbers, 5.5 kilogrammes of\r\nsteam removed from the juice.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the motive steam was at the very moderate\r\npressure of 4 effective atmospheres. Had the use of steam at high\r\npressure (7 atmospheres for example) been possible, it is easy to\r\nconclude from the above results that more than 6 kilogrammes of water\r\nwould have been vaporized with one kilogramme of steam.\r\n\r\nThe results here cited were ascertained by accurately measuring the\r\nquantities of water of condensation from each evaporator, they soon\r\nreceived, moreover, the most important of confirmations by the decrease\r\nin the general consumption of fuel by the generators which occurred\r\nafter the new apparatus was set in operation.\r\n\r\nThe mean consumption of coal per 24 hours for the twenty days preceding\r\nthe 18th of November was 86,060 kilogrammes. After this date the regular\r\nconsumption was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Nov. 19.................31,800 kilogrammes.\r\n   \"   20.................33,800     \"\r\n   \"   21.................33,800     \"\r\n   \"   22.................32,000     \"\r\n   \"   23.................31,400     \"\r\n   \"   24.................31,600     \"\r\n   \"   25.................30,500     \"\r\n   \"   26.................30,500     \"\r\n   \"   27.................28,600     \"\r\n   \"   28.................30,300     \"\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that in the perfectly regular running of the sugar\r\nworks, nothing was changed saving the setting of this evaporating\r\napparatus running. The same quantity of beets was treated per 24 hours,\r\nand the general temperature remained the same. This remarkable result in\r\nthe saving of fuel was brought about notwithstanding the new apparatus\r\ntreated but a third, at the most, of the total amount of the juice, the\r\nrest continuing to be concentrated by the double action process.\r\n\r\nAs for the running of the apparatus, that was perfectly regular, and the\r\ndeviations in temperature in each evaporater were scarcely two or three\r\ndegrees. The following are the mean temperatures:\r\n\r\nFirst evaporator: heating steam 110° C.; juice steam 100° C. Second\r\nevaporator: juice steam 83° C. Third evaporator: juice steam 62° C. As\r\nregards facility of operating the apparatus, the experiment has proved\r\nso conclusive that the plant will be considerably enlarged in view of\r\nthe coming crop, in order that a larger quantity of juice may be treated\r\nby the new process. The effect of this will be to still further increase\r\nthe saving in coal that has already been effected by the present\r\napparatus. The engraving which accompanies this article represents the\r\nWeibel-Piccard apparatus as it is now working in the Pohrlitz sugar\r\nworks. What we have said of it above we think will suffice to make it\r\nunderstood without further explanation.--_Le Genie Civil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF STRENGTH OF LARGE AND SMALL ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nW. N. LOCKINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Delebeuf, in a paper read before the Academie Royale de Belgique, and\r\npublished in the _Revue Scientique_, reviews the attempts of various\r\nnaturalists to make comparisons between the strength of large animals\r\nand that of small ones, especially insects, and shows that ignorance or\r\nforgetfulness of physical laws vitiates all their conclusions.\r\n\r\nAfter a plea for the idea without which the fact is barren, M. Delbeuf\r\nrepeats certain statements with which readers of modern zoological\r\nscience are tolerably familiar, such as the following: A flea can jump\r\ntwo hundred times its length; therefore a horse, were its strength\r\nproportioned to its weight, could leap the Rocky Mountains, and a whale\r\ncould spring two hundred leagues in height. An Amazon ant walks about\r\neight feet per minute, but if the progress of a human Amazon were\r\nproportioned to her larger size, she could stride over eight leagues in\r\nan hour; and if proportioned to her greater weight, she would make the\r\ncircuit of the globe in about twelve minutes. This seems greatly to the\r\nadvantage of the insect. What weak creatures vertebrates must be, is the\r\nimpression conveyed.\r\n\r\nBut the work increases as the weight. In springing, walking, swimming,\r\nor any other activity, the force employed has first to overcome the\r\nweight of the body. A man can easily bound a height of two feet, and\r\nhe weighs as much as a hundred thousand grasshoppers, while a hundred\r\nthousand grasshoppers could leap no higher than one--say a foot. This\r\nshows that the vertebrate has the advantage. A man represents the volume\r\nof fifteen millions of ants, yet can easily move more than three hundred\r\nfeet a minute, a comparison which gives him forty times more power, bulk\r\nfor bulk, than the ant possesses. Yet were all the conditions compared,\r\nsomething like equality would probably be the result. Much of the force\r\nof a moving man is lost from the inequalities of the way. His body,\r\nsupported on two points only when at rest, oscillates like a pendulum\r\nfrom one to the other as he moves. The ant crawls close to the ground,\r\nand has only a small part of the body unsupported at once. This\r\neconomizes force at each step, but on the other hand multiplies the\r\nnumber of steps so greatly, since the smallest irregularity of the\r\nsurface is a hill to a crawling creature, that the total loss of force\r\nis perhaps greater, since it has to slightly raise its body a thousand\r\ntimes or so to clear a space spanned by a man's one step.\r\n\r\nBy what peculiarity of our minds do we seem to expect the speed of an\r\nanimal to be in proportion to its size? We do not expect a caravan to\r\nmove faster than a single horseman, nor an eight hundred pound shot to\r\nmove twelve thousand eight hundred times farther than an ounce ball.\r\nDevout writers speak of a wise provision of Nature. \"If,\" say they, \"the\r\nspeed of a mouse were as much less than that of a horse as its body is\r\nsmaller, it would take two steps per second, and be caught at once.\"\r\nWould not Nature have done better for the mouse had she suppressed the\r\ncat? Is it not a fact that small animals often owe their escape to their\r\nwant of swiftness, which enables them to change their direction readily?\r\nA man can easily overtake a mouse in a straight run, but the ready\r\nchange of direction baffles him.\r\n\r\nM. Plateau has experimented on the strength of insects, and the facts\r\nare unassailable. He has harnessed carabi, necrophori, June-beetles\r\n(Melolontha), and other insects in such a way that, with a delicate\r\nbalance, he can measure their powers of draught. He announces the result\r\nthat the smallest insects are the strongest proportioned to their size,\r\nbut that all are enormously strong when compared bulk, for bulk, with\r\nvertebrates. A horse can scarcely lift two-thirds of its own weight,\r\nwhile one small species of June-beetle can lift sixty-six times its\r\nweight; forty thousand such June-beetles could lift as much as a\r\ndraught-horse. Were our strength in proportion to this, we could play\r\nwith weights equal to ten times that of a horse.\r\n\r\nThis seems, again, great kindness in Nature to the smaller animal. But\r\nall these calculations leave out the elementary mechanical law: \"What\r\nis gained in power is lost in time.\" The elevation of a ton to a given\r\nheight represents an expenditure of an equal amount of force, whether\r\nthe labor is performed by flea, man, or horse. Time supplies lack of\r\nstrength. We can move as much as a horse by taking more time, and can\r\nchoose two methods--either to divide the load or use a lever or a\r\npulley. If a horse moves half its own weight three feet in a second,\r\nwhile a June-beetle needs a hundred seconds to convey fifty times\r\nits weight an equal distance, the two animals perform equal work\r\nproportioned to their weights. True, the cockchafer can hold fourteen\r\ntimes its weight in equilibrium (one small June-beetle sixty-six times),\r\nwhile a horse cannot balance nearly his own weight. But this does not\r\nmeasure the amount of oscillatory motion induced by the respective\r\npulls. For this, both should operate against a spring.\r\n\r\nA small beetle can escape from under a piece of cardboard a hundred\r\ntimes its weight. Pushing its head under the edge and using it as a\r\nlever, it straightens itself on its legs and moves the board just a\r\nlittle, but enough to escape. Of course, we know a horse would be\r\npowerless to escape from a load a hundred times its own weight. His head\r\ncannot be made into a lever. Give him a lever that will make the time he\r\ntakes equal to that taken by the insect, and he will throw off the load\r\nat a touch. The fact is that in small creatures the lack of muscular\r\nenergy is replaced by time.\r\n\r\nOf two muscles equal in bulk and energy the shortest moves most weight.\r\nIf a muscular fiber ten inches in length can move a given weight five\r\ninches, ten fibers one inch long will move ten times that weight a\r\ndistance of half an inch. Thus smaller muscles have an absolutely\r\nslower motion, but move a greater proportional weight than larger.\r\nThe experimenter before mentioned was surprised to find that two\r\ngrasshoppers, one of which was three times the bulk of the other,\r\nleaped an equal height. This was what might be expected of two animals\r\nsimilarly constructed. The spring was proportioned to the bulk. In\r\nexperiments on the insects with powerful wings, such as bees, flies,\r\ndragon-flies, etc., it was found that the weight they could bear without\r\nbeing forced to descend was in most cases equal to their own. In some\r\ncases it was more, but the inequality of rate of flight, had it been\r\ntaken into the reckoning, would have accounted for this.\r\n\r\nTake two creatures of different bulk but built upon exactly the same\r\nplan and proportions, say a Brobdingnagian and a Lilliputian, and let\r\nboth show their powers in the arena. Suppose the first to weigh a\r\nmillion times more than the second. If the giant could raise to his\r\nshoulder, some thirty-five feet from the ground, a weight twenty\r\nthousand pounds, the dwarf can raise to his shoulder, not, as might be\r\nthought, a fiftieth of a pound, but two full pounds. The distance raised\r\nwould be a hundred times less. In a race the Lilliputian, with a hundred\r\nskips a second, will travel an equal distance with the giant, who would\r\ntake but a skip in a second. The leg of the latter weighs a million\r\ntimes the most, but has only ten thousand times as many muscle fibers,\r\neach a hundred times longer than those of the dwarf, who thus takes one\r\nhundred skips while the giant takes one. The same physical laws apply to\r\nall muscles, so that, when all the factors are considered, muscles of\r\nthe same quality have equal power.--_Am.

McKinley, writing to the Pittsburg _Dispatch_, gives the following\r\naccount of the California oil field at Newhall:\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the town is located the refinery of the company,\r\nconnected by pipe lines with the wells, a few miles distant. Leaving\r\nNewhall, we drove to Pico Cañon, the principal producing territory of\r\nthe region. As we approached, we saw, away up on the peaks, the tall\r\nderricks in places which looked inaccessible; but no spot is out of\r\nreach of American enterprise and perseverance. In one of the wildest\r\nspots of the cañon, about thirty men were making the mountains echo to\r\nthe strokes of their hammers upon the iron plates of a new 20,000 barrel\r\ntank. Along the cañon are scattered the houses of the employes of the\r\ncompany, most of whom have recently come from Pennsylvania. Near one of\r\nthe houses was a graded and leveled croquet ground, with a little oil\r\ntank on a post, for lighting it at night. Farther up we came to a\r\ncluster of producing wells, with others at a little distance on the\r\nsides of the mountains, or even at the top, hundreds of feet above our\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nThe first well was put down about eight years ago, but more has been\r\naccomplished in the last two years than in all the time previous. One\r\nwell which we visited has produced 130,000 barrels in the last three\r\nyears, and is still yielding. There have been no very large wells, the\r\nbest being 250 per day, and the average being about 90 barrels, but they\r\nkeep up their production, with scarcely any diminution from year to\r\nyear. Drilling has been found difficult, as a great portion of the rock\r\nis broken shale lying obliquely. The tools slip to one side very easily,\r\nand a number of \"crooked holes\" have resulted. One driller lost his\r\ntools altogether in a well, and finished it with new ones. The cost of\r\nputting down a well is from $5,000 to $7,000, depending upon depth, etc.\r\nMost of the wells are from 1,200 to 1,500 feet, but some have yielded at\r\na much less depth. One well of 270 feet depth produced 40 barrels per\r\nday for about three years, has been deepened, and is now yielding even\r\nmore. Another one of 800 feet is said to have produced 200,000 barrels\r\nin the last five or six years. Drilling has been very successful in\r\nstriking oil in paying quantities wherever there were indications of its\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Oil Company now has 27 wells producing or drilling, and\r\nduring the last two years has been rapidly widening the scope of its\r\noperations. It has now from 30 to 40 miles of pipe lines, and is\r\npreparing to lay 20 miles more, to connect its land with ocean shipping\r\nat Ventura. The producers of California have a great advantage in their\r\nproximity to the ocean, which gives them free commerce with the outside\r\nworld. Crude oil is now sold at $3 per barrel in Los Angeles, and the\r\noil companies are making immense profits. There is a very large amount\r\nof oil territory as yet undeveloped, and a rich reward awaits enterprise\r\nin these regions. In the Camulos District, which lies west of the San\r\nFernando, are even stronger surface indications of oil than there\r\nwere in the Pico Cañon. We first went up the Brea Cañon, in which are\r\nnumerous outbursts and springs of oil. Ascending the mountain west of\r\nthis cañon, we could plainly see the break in the mountains crossing\r\nfrom the San Fernando through this district to those beyond which\r\nhave been developed. A couple of miles farther west, the Hooper Cañon\r\nstretches back over two miles into the mountain, and is full of oil.\r\nGreat pools of oil fill its water courses, that are dry at present.\r\nHundreds of barrels of oil must be wasted away and evaporated during a\r\nyear. A well put down only 90 feet by horse power, struck light oil in\r\nconsiderable quantity, and, had it not been for the death of one of the\r\nowners and the consequent suspension of operations, would doubtless have\r\nyielded in large quantities at the depth of a few hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe mountainous territory between these two cañons will probably in a\r\nfew years be the scene of great activity. In the Little Sespe District,\r\na few miles west of Camulos, a 125 barrel well was struck at 1,500\r\nfeet recently. The Santa Paula region, a little farther west, is also\r\nyielding large profits to the parties developing it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTRITIVE VALUE OF CONDIMENTS.\r\n\r\nBy HELEN D. ABBOTT, Assistant in the Chemical Laboratory of the\r\nPhiladelphia Polyclinic, and College for Graduates in Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prevailing opinion respecting the substances known as condiments\r\nis, that they possess essentially stimulating qualities, rendering them\r\npeculiarly fitted for inducing, by reflex action, the secretion of the\r\nalimentary juices. Letheby gives, as the functions of condiments,\r\nsuch as pepper, mustard, spices, pot-herbs, etc., that besides their\r\nstimulating properties they give flavor to food; and by them indifferent\r\nfood is made palatable, and its digestion accelerated. He enumerates as\r\naids to digestion--proper selection of food, according to the taste of\r\nthe individual, proper treatment of it as regards cooking, and proper\r\nvariation of it, both as to its nature and treatment.\r\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to give an entirely satisfactory definition as to\r\nwhat constitutes food, the following extracts from standard works\r\nwill serve as guides. Hermann[1] says: \"The compound must be fit\r\nfor absorption into the blood or chyle, either directly, or after\r\npreparation by the processes of digestion, i.e., it must be digestible.\r\nIt must replace directly some inorganic or organic constituent of the\r\nbody; or it must undergo conversion into such a constituent, while in\r\nthe body; or it must serve as an ingredient in the construction of such\r\na constituent.\" He further says that water, chlorides, and phosphates\r\nare the most indispensable articles of diet. Watts[2] states that\r\n\"whatever is commonly absorbed in a state of health is perhaps the best,\r\nor rather the truest, definition of food.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Elements of Human Physiology, by L. Hermann. Translated by\r\nGamgee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dictionary of Chemistry, vol. iv., pages 147-8.]\r\n\r\nChemical analysis shows that the most important and widely applicable\r\nfoods contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and mineral matter,\r\nthe latter containing phosphates and chlorides. Other things being\r\nequal, it may be considered that the comparative nutrient value of\r\ntwo articles is in proportion to the amounts of carbon, nitrogen, and\r\nphosphoric acid they contain.\r\n\r\n\"The food of man also contains certain substances known under the name\r\nof condiments. Since these bodies perform their functions outside the\r\nreal body, though within the alimentary canal, they have no\r\nbetter reason to be considered as food than has hunger, _optimum\r\ncondimentum_.\"[1] Such is the positively expressed opinion of Foster,\r\nthe author of the article on nutrition in Watts' Dictionary of\r\nChemistry. With a view of determining how far the common condiments\r\ndeserve this summary dismissal, a number of analyses have been made in\r\nthe laboratory of the Philadelphia Polyclinic. My examinations were\r\nespecially directed to the mineral matter, phosphoric acid, and\r\nnitrogen. The following table shows the result of the analyses:\r\n\r\n                                 Percent.

The ash was obtained by burning in a platinum crucible, at\r\nas low a temperature as possible, dissolving in hydrochloric acid the\r\nphosphoric acid separated as ammonium molybdo-phosphate, and determined\r\nin the usual manner.\r\n\r\nQualitative tests made for nitrogen indicated its presence in each one\r\nof the condiments examined.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to observe that the majority of these condiments are\r\nfruits, ripe or nearly so. The seed appropriates to itself the nitrogen\r\nand the greatest nutritive properties for the development of the future\r\nplant. All nutritive substances fall into two classes: the one serves\r\nfor the repair of the unoxidizable constituents of the body, the other\r\nis destined to replace the oxidizable. Condiments fulfill both of\r\nthese requirements, as is shown by a study of their composition; the\r\nphosphoric acid and nitrogen are taken up by the tissues, as from other\r\nsubstances used in diet. Some articles affect the character of the\r\nexcretions; this is often due to essential oils; the presence of these\r\nin the excretions cannot be said to diminish the value of the substances\r\nin supplying the tissues the necessary elements. The same holds true for\r\ncondiments; the essential oils conspicuous in them are accorded only\r\nstimulating properties; however, it may be observed that the essential\r\noils in tea and coffee are accredited with a portion of the dietetic\r\nvalue of these beverages. It appears that when condiments are used in\r\nfood, especially for the sick, they may serve the double purpose of\r\nrendering the food more appetizing and of adding to its nutritive value.\r\nThe value of food as a purely therapeutic agent is attracting some\r\nattention at present, and in its study we must not neglect\r\nthose substances which combine stimulant and nutritive\r\nqualities.--_Polyclinic_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
