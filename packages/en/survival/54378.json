N. B. AND H. E. B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main object of the following chapters is to give a brief and\r\nsimple description of the most important and interesting facts\r\nconcerning the heavenly bodies, and to suggest to the general reader\r\nhow much of the ground thus covered lies open to his personal survey\r\non very easy conditions. Many people who are more or less interested\r\nin astronomy are deterred from making practical acquaintance with the\r\nwonders of the heavens by the idea that these are only disclosed to\r\nthe possessors of large and costly instruments. In reality there is\r\nprobably no science which offers to those whose opportunities and\r\nmeans of observation are restricted greater stores of knowledge and\r\npleasure than astronomy; and the possibility of that quickening of\r\ninterest which can only be gained by practical study is, in these\r\ndays, denied to very few indeed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I have endeavoured, while recounting the great triumphs\r\nof astronomical discovery, to give some practical help to those who\r\nare inclined to the study of the heavens, but do not know how to\r\nbegin. My excuse for venturing on such a task must be that, in the\r\ncourse of nearly twenty years of observation with telescopes of all\r\nsorts and sizes, I have made most of the mistakes against which others\r\nneed to be warned.\r\n\r\nThe book has no pretensions to being a complete manual; it is merely\r\ndescriptive of things seen and learned. Nor has it any claim to\r\noriginality. On the contrary, one of its chief purposes has been to\r\ngather into short compass the results of the work of others. I have\r\ntherefore to acknowledge my indebtedness to other writers, and notably\r\nto Miss Agnes Clerke, Professor Young, Professor Newcomb, the late\r\nRev. T. W. Webb, and Mr. W. F. Denning. I have also found much help in\r\nthe _Monthly Notices_ and _Memoirs_ of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety, and the _Journal_ and _Memoirs_ of the British Astronomical\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations have been mainly chosen with the view of\r\nrepresenting to the general reader some of the results of the best\r\nmodern observers and instruments; but I have ventured to reproduce a\r\nfew specimens of more commonplace work done with small telescopes. I\r\ndesire to offer my cordial thanks to those who have so kindly granted\r\nme permission to reproduce illustrations from their published works,\r\nor have lent photographs or drawings for reproduction--to Miss Agnes\r\nClerke for Plates XXV.-XXVIII. and XXX.-XXXII. inclusive; to\r\nMrs. Maunder for Plate VIII.; to M. Loewy, Director of the Paris\r\nObservatory, for Plates XI.-XIV. and Plate XVII.; to Professor E. B.\r\nFrost, Director of the Yerkes Observatory, for Plates I., VII., XV.,\r\nand XVI.; to M. Deslandres, of the Meudon Observatory, for Plate IX.,\r\nand the gift of several of his own solar memoirs; to the Astronomer\r\nRoyal for England, Sir W. Mahony Christie, for Plate V.; to Mr. H.\r\nMacEwen for the drawings of Venus, Plate X.; to the Rev. T. E. R.\r\nPhillips for those of Mars and Jupiter, Plates XX. and XXII.; to\r\nProfessor Barnard for that of Saturn, Plate XXIV., reproduced by\r\npermission from the _Monthly Notices_ of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety; to Mr. W.

Cooke and Sons for Plate II. For those who wish to see for\r\nthemselves some of the wonders and beauties of the starry heavens\r\nthe two Appendices furnish a few specimens chosen from an innumerable\r\ncompany; while readers who have no desire to engage in practical work\r\nare invited to skip Chapters I. and II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                         PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.

Holland maintains the rights of Jansen, Lippershey, and\r\nMetius; while our own country produces evidence that Roger Bacon\r\nhad, in the thirteenth century, 'arrived at theoretical proof of the\r\npossibility of constructing a telescope and a microscope' and that\r\nLeonard Digges 'had a method of discovering, by perspective glasses\r\nset at due angles, all objects pretty far distant that the sun shone\r\non, which lay in the country round about.'\r\n\r\nAll these claims, however, whether well or ill founded, are very\r\nlittle to the point. The man to whom the human race owes a debt of\r\ngratitude in connection with any great invention is not necessarily he\r\nwho, perhaps by mere accident, may stumble on the principle of it, but\r\nhe who takes up the raw material of the invention and shows the full\r\npowers and possibilities which are latent in it. In the present\r\ncase there is one such man to whom, beyond all question, we owe the\r\ntelescope as a practical astronomical instrument, and that man is\r\nGalileo Galilei. He himself admits that it was only after hearing, in\r\n1609, that a Dutchman had succeeded in making such an instrument,\r\nthat he set himself to investigate the matter, and produced telescopes\r\nranging from one magnifying but three diameters up to the one with a\r\npower of thirty-three with which he made his famous discoveries; but\r\nthis fact cannot deprive the great Italian of the credit which is\r\nundoubtedly his due. Others may have anticipated him in theory, or\r\neven to a small extent in practice, but Galileo first gave to the\r\nworld the telescope as an instrument of real value in research.\r\n\r\nThe telescope with which he made his great discoveries was constructed\r\non a principle which, except in the case of binoculars, is now\r\ndiscarded. It consisted of a double convex lens converging the rays\r\nof light from a distant object, and of a double concave lens,\r\nintercepting the convergent rays before they reach a focus, and\r\nrendering them parallel again (Fig. 1). His largest instrument, as\r\nalready mentioned, had a power of only thirty-three diameters, and the\r\nfield of view was very small. A more powerful one can now be obtained\r\nfor a few shillings, or constructed, one might almost say, for a\r\nfew pence; yet, as Proctor has observed: 'If we regard the absolute\r\nimportance of the discoveries effected by different telescopes,\r\nfew, perhaps, will rank higher than the little tube now lying in the\r\nTribune of Galileo at Florence.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--PRINCIPLE OF GALILEAN TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nGalileo's first discoveries with this instrument were made in 1610,\r\nand it was not till nearly half a century later that any great\r\nimprovement in telescopic construction was effected. In the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century Scheiner and Huygens made telescopes on the\r\nprinciple, suggested by Kepler, of using two double convex lenses\r\ninstead of a convex and a concave, and the modern refracting telescope\r\nis still constructed on essentially the same principle, though, of\r\ncourse, with many minor modifications (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--PRINCIPLE OF COMMON REFRACTOR.]\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the seventeenth century witnessed the introduction\r\nof telescopes on this principle of the most amazing length, the\r\nincrease in length being designed to minimize the imperfections which\r\na simple lens exhibits both in definition and in colour. Huygens\r\nconstructed one such telescope of 123 feet focal length, which he\r\npresented to the Royal Society of London; Cassini, at Paris, used\r\ninstruments of 100 and 136 feet; while Bradley, in 1722, measured the\r\ndiameter of Venus with a glass whose focal length was 212-1/4 feet.\r\nAuzout is said to have made glasses of lengths varying from 300 to\r\n600 feet, but, as might have been expected, there is no record of any\r\nuseful observations having ever been made with these monstrosities. Of\r\ncourse, these instruments differed widely from the compact and handy\r\ntelescopes with which we are now familiar. They were entirely without\r\ntubes. The object-glass was fastened to a tall pole or to some high\r\nbuilding, and was painfully man[oe]uvred into line with the eye-piece,\r\nwhich was placed on a support near the ground, by means of an\r\narrangement of cords. The difficulties of observation with these\r\nunwieldy monsters must have been of the most exasperating type, while\r\ntheir magnifying power did not exceed that of an ordinary modern\r\nachromatic of, perhaps, 36 inches focal length. Cassini, for instance,\r\nseems never to have gone beyond a power of 150 diameters, which might\r\nbe quite usefully employed on a good modern 3-inch refractor in\r\ngood air. Yet with such tools he was able to discover four of the\r\nsatellites of Saturn and that division in Saturn's ring which still\r\nbears his name. Such facts speak volumes for the quality of the\r\nobserver. Those who are the most accustomed to use the almost perfect\r\nproducts of modern optical skill will have the best conception of,\r\nand the profoundest admiration for, the limitless patience and the\r\nwonderful ability which enabled him to achieve such results with the\r\nvery imperfect means at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe clumsiness and unmanageableness of these aerial telescopes quickly\r\nreached a point which made it evident that nothing more was to be\r\nexpected of them; and attempts were made to find a method of combining\r\nlenses, which might result in an instrument capable of bearing equal\r\nor greater magnifying powers on a much shorter length. The chief\r\nhindrance to the efficiency of the refracting telescope lies in the\r\nfact that the rays of different colours which collectively compose\r\nwhite light cannot be brought to one focus by any single lens. The red\r\nrays, for example, have a different focal length from the blue, and\r\nso any lens which brings the one set to a focus leaves a fringe of the\r\nother outstanding around any bright object.\r\n\r\nIn 1729 Mr. Chester Moor Hall discovered a means of conquering this\r\ndifficulty, but his results were not followed up, and it was left for\r\nthe optician John Dollond to rediscover the principle some twenty-five\r\nyears later. By making the object-glass of the telescope double, the\r\none lens being of crown and the other of flint glass, he succeeded in\r\nobtaining a telescope which gave a virtually colourless image.\r\n\r\nThis great discovery of the achromatic form of construction at\r\nonce revolutionized the art of telescope-making. It was found that\r\ninstruments of not more than 5 feet focal length could be constructed,\r\nwhich infinitely surpassed in efficiency, as well as in handiness,\r\nthe cumbrous tools which Cassini had used; and Dollond's 5-foot\r\nachromatics, generally with object-glasses of 3-3/4 inches diameter,\r\nrepresented for a considerable time the acme of optical excellence.\r\nSince the time of Dollond, the record of the achromatic refractor has\r\nbeen one of continual, and, latterly, of very rapid progress. For\r\na time much hindrance was experienced from the fact that it proved\r\nexceedingly difficult to obtain glass discs of any size whose purity\r\nand uniformity were sufficient to enable them to pass the stringent\r\ntest of optical performance. In the latter part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, a 6-inch glass was considered with feelings of admiration,\r\nsomewhat similar to those with which we regard the Yerkes 40-inch\r\nto-day; and when, in 1823, the Dorpat refractor of 9-6/10 inches was\r\nmounted (Fig. 3), the astronomical world seemed to have the idea that\r\nsomething very like finality had been reached. The Dorpat telescope\r\nproved, however, to be only a milestone on the path of progress.\r\nBefore very long it was surpassed by a glass of 12 inches diameter,\r\nwhich Sir James South obtained from Cauchoix of Paris, and which is\r\nnow mounted in the Dunsink Observatory, Dublin. This, in its turn,\r\nhad to give place to the fine instruments of 14·9 inches which were\r\nfigured by Merz of Munich for the Pulkowa and Cambridge (U.S.A.)\r\nObservatories; and then there came a pause of a few years, which was\r\nbroken by Alvan Clark's completion of an 18-1/2-inch, an instrument\r\nwhich earned its diploma, before ever it left the workshop of its\r\nconstructor, by the discovery of the companion to Sirius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--DORPAT REFRACTOR.]\r\n\r\nThe next step was made on our side of the Atlantic, and proved to be\r\na long and notable one, in a sense definitely marking out the boundary\r\nline of the modern era of giant refractors. This was the completion,\r\nby Thomas Cooke, of York, of a 25-inch instrument for the late Mr.\r\nNewall. It did not retain for long its pride of place. The palm was\r\nspeedily taken back to America by Alvan Clark's construction of the\r\n26-inch of the Washington Naval Observatory, with which Professor\r\nAsaph Hall discovered in 1877 the two satellites of Mars. Then came\r\nGrubb's 27-inch for Vienna; the pair of 30-inch instruments, by Clark\r\nand Henry respectively, for Pulkowa (Fig. 4) and Nice; and at last the\r\ninstrument which has for a number of years been regarded as the finest\r\nexample of optical skill in the world, the 36-inch Clark refractor of\r\nthe Lick Observatory, California. Placed at an elevation of over 4,000\r\nfeet, and in a climate exceptionally well suited for astronomical\r\nwork, this fine instrument has had the advantage of being handled by a\r\nvery remarkable succession of brilliant observers, and has, since\r\nits completion, been looked to as a sort of court of final appeal in\r\ndisputed questions. But America has not been satisfied even with\r\nsuch an instrument, and the 40-inch Clark refractor of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory is at present the last word of optical skill so far as\r\nachromatics are concerned (Frontispiece). It is not improbable that it\r\nmay also be the last word so far as size goes, for the late Professor\r\nKeeler's report upon its performance implies that in this splendid\r\ntelescope the limit of practicable size for object-glasses is being\r\napproached. The star images formed by the great lens show indications\r\nof slight flexure of the glass under its own weight as it is turned\r\nfrom one part of the sky to another. It would be rash, however, to\r\nsay that even this difficulty will not be overcome. So many obstacles,\r\nseemingly insuperable, have vanished before the astronomer's imperious\r\ndemand for 'more light,' and so many great telescopes, believed in\r\ntheir day to represent the absolute culmination of the optical art,\r\nare now mere commoners in the ranks where once they were supreme, that\r\nit may quite conceivably prove that the great Yerkes refractor, like\r\nso many of its predecessors, represents only a stage and not the end\r\nof the journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--30-INCH REFRACTOR, PULKOWA OBSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sir Isaac Newton, considering, wrongly as the sequel\r\nshowed, that 'the case of the refractor was desperate,' set about\r\nthe attempt to find out whether the reflection of light by means\r\nof suitably-shaped mirrors might not afford a substitute for the\r\nrefractor. In this attempt he was successful, and in 1671 presented to\r\nthe Royal Society the first specimen, constructed by his own hands, of\r\nthat form of reflecting telescope which has since borne his name. The\r\nprinciple of the Newtonian reflector will be easily grasped from Fig.\r\n5. The rays of light from the object under inspection enter the open\r\nmouth of the instrument, and passing down the tube are converged by\r\nthe concave mirror AA towards a focus, before reaching which they\r\nare intercepted by the small flat mirror BB, placed at an angle of\r\n45 degrees to the axis of the tube, and are by it reflected into the\r\neye-piece E which is placed at the side of the instrument. In this\r\nconstruction, therefore, the observer actually looks in a direction\r\nat right angles to that of the object which he is viewing, a condition\r\nwhich seems strange to the uninitiated, but which presents no\r\ndifficulties in practice, and is found to have several advantages,\r\nchief among them the fact that there is no breaking of one's neck in\r\nthe attempt to observe objects near the zenith, the line of vision\r\nbeing always horizontal, no matter what may be the altitude of the\r\nobject under inspection. Other forms of reflector have been devised,\r\nand go by the names of the Gregorian, the Cassegrain, and the\r\nHerschelian; but the Newtonian has proved itself the superior, and has\r\npractically driven its rivals out of the field, though the Cassegrain\r\nform has been revived in a few instances of late years, and is\r\nparticularly suited to certain forms of research.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--PRINCIPLE OF NEWTONIAN REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--LORD ROSSE'S TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nAt first the mirrors of reflecting telescopes were made of an alloy\r\nknown as speculum metal, which consisted of practically 4 parts of\r\ncopper to 1 of tin; but during the last half-century this metal has\r\nbeen entirely superseded by mirrors made of glass ground to the proper\r\nfigure, and then polished and silvered on the face by a chemical\r\nprocess. To the reflecting form of construction belong some of the\r\nlargest telescopes in the world, such as the Rosse 6-foot (metal\r\nmirrors), Fig. 6, the Common 5-foot (silver on glass), the Melbourne\r\n4-foot (metal mirrors, Cassegrain form), and the 5-foot constructed by\r\nMr. Ritchey for the Yerkes Observatory. Probably the most celebrated,\r\nas it was also the first of these monsters, was the 4-foot telescope\r\nof Sir William Herschel, made by himself on the principle which goes\r\nby his name. It was used by him to some extent in the discoveries\r\nwhich have made his name famous, and nearly everyone who has ever\r\nopened an astronomical book is familiar with the engraving of the huge\r\n40-foot tube, with its cumbrous staging, which Oliver Wendell Holmes\r\nhas so quaintly celebrated in 'The Poet at the Breakfast Table' (Fig.\r\n7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--HERSCHEL'S 4-FOOT REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE TELESCOPE--PRACTICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly sketched the history of the telescope, we turn now\r\nto consider the optical means which are most likely to be in the hands\r\nor within the reach of the beginner in astronomical observation. Let\r\nus, first of all, make the statement that any telescope, good, bad, or\r\nindifferent, is better than no telescope. There are some purists who\r\nwould demur to such a statement, who make the beginner's heart heavy\r\nwith the verdict that it is better to have no telescope at all\r\nthan one that is not of the utmost perfection, and, of course, of\r\ncorresponding costliness, and who seem to believe that the performance\r\nof an inferior glass may breed disgust at astronomy altogether. This\r\nis surely mere nonsense. For most amateurs at the beginning of their\r\nastronomical work the question is not between a good telescope and an\r\ninferior one, it is between a telescope and no telescope. Of course,\r\nno one would be so foolish as willingly to observe with an inferior\r\ninstrument if a better could be had; but even a comparatively poor\r\nglass will reveal much that is of great interest and beauty, and\r\nits defects must even be put up with sometimes for the sake of its\r\nadvantages until something more satisfactory can be obtained. An\r\ninstrument which will show fifty stars where the naked eye sees five\r\nis not to be despised, even though it may show wings to Sirius that\r\nhave no business there, or a brilliant fringe of colours round Venus\r\nto which even that beautiful planet can lay no real claim. Galileo's\r\ntelescope would be considered a shockingly bad instrument nowadays;\r\nstill, it had its own little influence upon the history of astronomy,\r\nand the wonders which it first revealed are easily within the reach of\r\nanyone who has the command of a shilling or two, and, what is perhaps\r\nstill more important, of a little patience. The writer has still in\r\nhis possession an object-glass made out of a simple single eyeglass,\r\nsuch as is worn by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. This, mounted in a\r\ncardboard tube with another single lens in a sliding tube as an\r\neye-piece, proved competent to reveal the more prominent lunar\r\ncraters, a number of sunspots, the phases of Venus, and the existence,\r\nthough not the true form, of Saturn's ring. Its total cost, if memory\r\nserve, was one shilling and a penny. Of course it showed, in addition,\r\na number of things which should not have been seen, such as a lovely\r\nborder of colour round every bright object; but, at the same time,\r\nit gave a great deal more than thirteen pence worth of pleasure and\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is this to be said in favour of beginning with a\r\ncheap and inferior instrument, that experience may thus be gained\r\nin the least costly fashion. The budding astronomer is by nature\r\ninsatiably curious. He wants to know the why and how of all the things\r\nthat his telescope does or does not do. Now this curiosity, while\r\neminently laudable in itself, is apt in the end to be rather hard\r\nupon his instrument. A fine telescope, whatever its size may be, is\r\nan instrument that requires and should receive careful handling; it is\r\neasily damaged, and costly to replace. And therefore it may be better\r\nthat the beginner should make his earlier experiments, and find\r\nout the more conspicuous and immediately fatal of the many ways of\r\ndamaging a telescope, upon an instrument whose injury, or even whose\r\ntotal destruction, need not cause him many pangs or much financial\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested that a beginning should necessarily be made on\r\nsuch a humble footing as that just indicated. Telescopes of the sizes\r\nmainly referred to in these pages--_i.e._, refractors of 2 or 3 inches\r\naperture, and reflectors of 4-1/2 to 6 inches--may frequently be\r\npicked up second-hand at a very moderate figure indeed. Of course, in\r\nthese circumstances the purchaser has to take his chance of defects\r\nin the instrument, unless he can arrange for a trial of it, either by\r\nhimself, or, preferably, by a friend who has some experience; yet even\r\nshould the glass turn out far from perfect, the chances are that it\r\nwill at least be worth the small sum paid for it. Nor is it in the\r\nleast probable, as some writers seem to believe, that the use of\r\nan inferior instrument will disgust the student and hinder him from\r\nprosecuting his studies. The chances are that it will merely create\r\na desire for more satisfactory optical means. Even a skilled observer\r\nlike the late Rev. T. W. Webb had to confess of one of his telescopes\r\nthat 'much of its light went the wrong way'; and yet he was able to\r\nget both use and pleasure out of it. The words of a well-known English\r\namateur observer may be quoted. After detailing his essays with\r\nglasses of various degrees of imperfection Mr. Mee remarks: 'For the\r\nintending amateur I could wish no other experience than my own. To\r\ncommence with a large and perfect instrument is a mistake; its owner\r\ncannot properly appreciate it, and in gaining experience is pretty\r\nsure to do the glass irreparable injury.'\r\n\r\nShould the beginner not be willing or able to face the purchase\r\nof even a comparatively humble instrument, his case is by no means\r\ndesperate, for he will find facilities at hand, such as were not\r\nthought of a few years ago, for the construction of his own telescope.\r\nTwo-inch achromatic object-glasses, with suitable lenses for the\r\nmaking up of the requisite eye-pieces, are to be had for a few\r\nshillings, together with cardboard tubes of sizes suitable for\r\nfitting up the instrument; and such a volume as Fowler's 'Telescopic\r\nAstronomy' gives complete directions for the construction of a glass\r\nwhich is capable of a wonderful amount of work in proportion to\r\nits cost. The substitution of metal tubes for the cardboard ones is\r\ndesirable, as metal will be found to be much more satisfactory if the\r\ninstrument is to be much used. The observer, however, will not long\r\nbe satisfied with such tools as these, useful though they may be. The\r\nnatural history of amateur astronomers may be summed up briefly in the\r\nwords 'they go from strength to strength.' The possessor of a small\r\ntelescope naturally and inevitably covets a bigger one; and when the\r\nbigger one has been secured it represents only a stage in the search\r\nfor one bigger still, while along with the desire for increased size\r\ngoes that for increased optical perfection. No properly constituted\r\namateur will be satisfied until he has got the largest and best\r\ninstrument that he has money to buy, space to house, and time to use.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, that the telescope has been acquired, and that\r\nit is such an instrument as may very commonly be found in the hands\r\nof a beginner--a refractor, say, of 2, 2-1/2, or 3 inches aperture\r\n(diameter of object-glass). The question of reflectors will fall to\r\nbe considered later. Human nature suggests that the first thing to do\r\nwith it is to unscrew all the screws and take the new acquisition to\r\npieces, so far as possible, in order to examine into its construction.\r\nHence many glasses whose career of usefulness is cut short before\r\nit has well begun. 'In most cases,' says Webb, 'a screw-driver is a\r\ndangerous tool in inexperienced hands'; and Smyth, in the Prolegomena\r\nto his 'Celestial Cycle,' utters words of solemn warning to the\r\n'over-handy gentlemen who, in their feverish anxiety for meddling\r\nwith and making instruments, are continually tormenting them with\r\nscrew-drivers, files, and what-not.' Unfortunately, it is not only\r\nthe screw-driver that is dangerous; the most deadly danger to the most\r\ndelicate part of the telescope lies in the unarmed but inexperienced\r\nhands themselves. You may do more irreparable damage to the\r\nobject-glass of your telescope in five minutes with your fingers than\r\nyou are likely to do to the rest of the instrument in a month with\r\na screw-driver. Remember that an object-glass is a work of art,\r\nsometimes as costly as, and always much more remarkable than, the\r\nfinest piece of jewellery. It may be unscrewed, _carefully_, from\r\nthe end of its tube and examined. Should the examination lead to the\r\ndetection of bubbles or even scratches in the glass (quite likely the\r\nlatter if the instrument be second-hand), these need not unduly vex\r\nits owner's soul. They do not necessarily mean bad performance, and\r\nthe amount of light which they obstruct is very small, unless the\r\ncase be an extreme one. But on no account should the two lenses of the\r\nobject-glass itself be separated, for this will only result in making\r\na good objective bad and a bad one worse. The lenses were presumably\r\nplaced in their proper adjustment to one another by an optician before\r\nbeing sent out; and should their performance be so unsatisfactory\r\nas to suggest that this adjustment has been disturbed, it is to an\r\noptician that they should be returned for inspection. The glass may,\r\nof course, be carefully and gently cleaned, using either soft chamois\r\nleather, or preferably an old silk handkerchief, studiously kept\r\nfrom dust; but the cleaning should never amount to more than a gentle\r\nsweeping away of any dust which may have gathered on the surface.\r\nRubbing is not to be thought of, and the man whose telescope has been\r\nso neglected that its object-glass needs rubbing should turn to some\r\nother and less reprehensible form of mischief. For cleaning the\r\nsmall lenses of the eye-pieces, the same silk may be employed; Webb\r\nrecommends a piece of blotting-paper, rolled to a point and aided by\r\nbreathing, for the edges which are awkward to get at. Care must, of\r\ncourse, be taken to replace these lenses in their original positions,\r\nand the easiest way to ensure this is to take out only one at a time.\r\nIn replacing them, see that the finger does not touch the surface of\r\nthe glass, or the cleaning will be all to do over again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.\r\n\r\n_a_, O.G. in perfect adjustment; _b_, O.G. defectively centred.]\r\n\r\nNext comes the question of testing the quality of the objective. (The\r\nstand is meanwhile assumed, but will be spoken of later.) Point the\r\ntelescope to a star of about the third magnitude, and employ\r\nthe eye-piece of highest power, if more than one goes with the\r\ninstrument--this will be the shortest eye-piece of the set. If the\r\nglass be of high quality, the image of the star will be a neat round\r\ndisc of small size, surrounded by one or two thin bright rings (Fig.\r\n8, _a_). Should the image be elliptical and the rings be thrown to the\r\none side (Fig. 8, _b_), the glass may still be quite a good one, but\r\nis out of square, and should be readjusted by an optician. Should\r\nthe image be irregular and the rings broken, the glass is of inferior\r\nquality, though it may still be serviceable enough for many purposes.\r\nNext throw the image of the star out of focus by racking the eye-piece\r\nin towards the objective, and then repeat the process by racking it\r\nagain out of focus away from the objective. The image will, in either\r\ncase, expand into a number of rings of light, and these rings should\r\nbe truly circular, and should present precisely the same appearance at\r\nequal distances within and without the focus. A further conception of\r\nthe objective's quality may be gained by observing whether the image\r\nof a star or the detail of the moon or of the planets comes sharply\r\nto a focus when the milled head for focussing is turned. Should it\r\nbe possible to rack the eye-tube in or out for any distance without\r\ndisturbing the distinctness of the picture to any extent, then the\r\nglass is defective. A good objective will admit of no such range, but\r\nwill come sharply up to focus, and as sharply away from it, with any\r\nmotion of the focussing screw. A good glass will also show the details\r\nof a planet like Saturn, such as are within its reach, that is, with\r\nclearness of definition, while an inferior one will soften all the\r\noutlines, and impart a general haziness to them. The observer may now\r\nproceed to test the colour correction of his objective. No achromatic,\r\nits name notwithstanding, ever gives an absolutely colourless image;\r\nall that can be expected is that the colour aberration should have\r\nbeen so far eliminated as not to be unpleasant. In a good instrument\r\na fringe of violet or blue will be seen around any bright object, such\r\nas Venus, on a dark sky; a poor glass will show red or yellow. It\r\nis well to make sure, however, should bad colour be seen, that the\r\neye-piece is not causing it; and, therefore, more than one eye-piece\r\nshould be tried before an opinion is formed. Probably more colour will\r\nbe seen at first than was expected, more particularly with an object\r\nso brilliant as Venus. But the observer need not worry overmuch about\r\nthis. He will find that the eye gets so accustomed to it as almost\r\nto forget that it is there, so that something of a shock may be\r\nexperienced when a casual star-gazing friend, on looking at some\r\nbright object, remarks, as friends always do, 'What beautiful\r\ncolours!' Denning records a somewhat extreme case in which a friend,\r\nwho had been accustomed to observe with a refractor, absolutely\r\nresented the absence of the familiar colour fringe in the picture\r\ngiven by a reflector, which is the true achromatic in nature, though\r\nnot in name. The beginner is recommended to read the article 'The\r\nAdjustment of a Small Equatorial,' by Mr. E. W. Maunder, in the\r\n_Journal of the British Astronomical Association_, vol. ii., p. 219,\r\nwhere he will find the process of testing described at length and with\r\ngreat clearness.\r\n\r\nIn making these tests, allowance has, of course, to be made for the\r\nstate of the atmosphere. A good telescope can only do its best on a\r\ngood night, and it is not fair to any instrument to condemn it until\r\nit has been tested under favourable conditions. The ideal test would\r\nbe to have its performance tried along with that of another instrument\r\nof known good quality and of as nearly the same size as possible. If\r\nthis cannot be arranged for, the tests must be made on a succession\r\nof nights, and good performance on one of these is sufficient to\r\nvindicate the reputation of the glass, and to show that any deficiency\r\non other occasions was due to the state of the air, and not to the\r\ninstrument. Should his telescope pass the above tests satisfactorily,\r\nthe observer ought to count himself a happy man, and will until he\r\nbegins to hanker after a bigger instrument.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the pointing of the telescope to a star brings up the\r\nquestion of how this is to be done. It seems a simple thing; as a\r\nmatter of fact, with anything like a high magnifying power it is next\r\nto impossible; and there are few things more exasperating than to see\r\na star or a planet shining brightly before your eyes, and yet to find\r\nyourself quite unable to get it into the field of view. The simple\r\nremedy is the addition of a finder to the telescope. This is a small\r\ntelescope of low magnifying power which is fastened to the larger\r\ninstrument by means of collars bearing adjusting screws, which enable\r\nit to be laid accurately parallel with the large tube (Fig. 10). Its\r\neye-piece is furnished with cross-threads, and a star brought to\r\nthe intersection of these threads will be in the field of the large\r\ntelescope. In place of the two threads crossing at right angles there\r\nmay be substituted three threads interlacing to form a little triangle\r\nin the centre of the finder's field. By this device the star can\r\nalways be seen when the glass is being pointed instead of being\r\nhidden, as in the other case, behind the intersection of the two\r\nthreads. A fine needle-point fixed in the eye-piece will also be found\r\nan efficient substitute for the cross-threads. In the absence of\r\na finder the telescope may be pointed by using the lowest power\r\neye-piece and substituting a higher one when the object is in the\r\nfield; but beyond question the finder is well worth the small\r\naddition which it makes to the cost of an instrument. A little care\r\nin adjusting the finder now and again will often save trouble and\r\nannoyance on a working evening.\r\n\r\nThe question of a stand on which to mount the telescope now falls to\r\nbe considered, and is one of great importance, though apt to be rather\r\nneglected at first. It will soon be found that little satisfaction or\r\ncomfort can be had in observing unless the stand adopted is steady. A\r\nshaky mounting will spoil the performance of the best telescope that\r\never was made, and will only tantalize the observer with occasional\r\nglimpses of what might be seen under better conditions. Better have a\r\nlittle less aperture to the object-glass, and a good steady mounting,\r\nthan an extra inch of objective and a mounting which robs you of all\r\ncomfort in the using of your telescope. Beginners are indeed rather\r\napt to be misled into the idea that the only matters of importance are\r\nthe objective and its tube, and that money spent on the stand is money\r\nwasted. Hence many fearful and wonderful contrivances for doing badly\r\nwhat a little saved in the size of the telescope and expended on the\r\nstand would have enabled them to do well. It is very interesting, no\r\ndoubt, to get a view of Jupiter or Saturn for one field's-breadth,\r\nand then to find, on attempting to readjust the instrument for another\r\nlook, that the mounting has obligingly taken your star-gazing into its\r\nown hands, and is now directing your telescope to a different object\r\naltogether; but repetition of this form of amusement is apt to pall. A\r\nradically weak stand can never be made into a good one; the best plan\r\nis to get a properly proportioned mounting at once, and be done with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--SMALL TELESCOPE ON PILLAR AND CLAW STAND.]\r\n\r\nFor small instruments, such as we are dealing with, the mounting\r\ngenerally adopted is that known as the Altazimuth, from its giving two\r\nmotions, one in altitude and one in azimuth, or, to use more familiar\r\nterms, one vertical and the other horizontal. There are various types\r\nof the Altazimuth. If the instrument be of not more than 3 feet focal\r\nlength, the ordinary stand known as the 'pillar and claw' (Fig. 9)\r\nwill meet all the requirements of this form of motion. Should the\r\nfocal length be greater than 3 feet, it is advisable to have the\r\ninstrument mounted on a tripod stand, such as is shown in Fig. 10. In\r\nthe simpler forms of both these mountings the two motions requisite\r\nto follow an object must be given by hand, and it is practically\r\nimpossible to do this without conveying a certain amount of tremor to\r\nthe telescope, which disturbs clearness of vision until it subsides,\r\nby which time the object to be viewed is generally getting ready to\r\ngo out of the field again. To obviate this inconvenience as far as\r\npossible, the star or planet when found should be placed just outside\r\nthe field of view, and allowed to enter it by the diurnal motion\r\nof the earth. The tremors will thus have time to subside before the\r\nobject reaches the centre of the field, and this process must\r\nbe repeated as long as the observation continues. In making this\r\nadjustment attention must be paid to the direction of the object's\r\nmotion through the field, which, of course, varies according to its\r\nposition in the sky. If it be remembered that a star's motion through\r\nthe telescopic field is the exact reverse of its true direction across\r\nthe sky, little difficulty will be found, and use will soon render\r\nthe matter so familiar that the adjustment will be made almost\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--TELESCOPE ON TRIPOD, WITH FINDER AND SLOW\r\nMOTIONS.]\r\n\r\nA much more convenient way of imparting the requisite motions is by\r\nthe employment of tangent screws connected with Hooke's joint-handles,\r\nwhich are brought conveniently near to the hands of the observer as\r\nhe sits at the eye-end. These screws clamp into circles or portions of\r\ncircles, which have teeth cut on them to fit the pitch of the screw,\r\nand by means of them a slow and steady motion may be imparted to the\r\ntelescope. When it is required to move the instrument more rapidly, or\r\nover a large expanse of sky, the clamps which connect the screws with\r\nthe circles are slackened, and the motion is given by hand. Fig. 10\r\nshows an instrument provided with these adjuncts, which, though not\r\nabsolutely necessary, and adding somewhat to the cost of the mounting,\r\nare certainly a great addition to the ease and comfort of observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--EQUATORIAL MOUNTING FOR SMALL TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe Altazimuth mounting, from its simplicity and comparative\r\ncheapness, has all along been, and will probably continue to be, the\r\nform most used by amateurs. It is, however, decidedly inferior in\r\nevery respect to the equatorial form of mount. In this form (Fig. 11)\r\nthe telescope is carried by means of two axes, one of which--the Polar\r\naxis--is so adjusted as to be parallel to the pole of the earth's\r\nrotation, its degree of inclination being therefore dependent upon the\r\nlatitude of the place for which it is designed. At the equator it will\r\nbe horizontal, will lie at an angle of 45 degrees half-way between\r\nthe equator and either pole, and will be vertical at the poles. At its\r\nupper end it carries a cross-head with bearings through which there\r\npasses another axis at right angles to the first (the declination\r\naxis). Both these axes are free to rotate in their respective\r\nbearings, and thus the telescope is capable of two motions, one of\r\nwhich--that of the declination axis--enables the instrument to be set\r\nto the elevation of the object to be observed, while the other--that\r\nof the polar axis--enables the observer to follow the object, when\r\nfound, from its rising to its setting by means of a single movement,\r\nthe telescope sweeping out circles on the sky corresponding to those\r\nwhich the stars themselves describe in their journey across the\r\nheavens. This single movement may be given by means of a tangent screw\r\nsuch as has already been described, and the use of a telescope thus\r\nequipped is certainly much easier and more convenient than that of an\r\nAltazimuth, where two motions have constantly to be imparted. To gain\r\nthe full advantage of the equatorial form of mounting, the polar axis\r\nmust be placed exactly in the North and South line, and unless the\r\nmounting can be adjusted properly and left in adjustment, it is robbed\r\nof much of its superiority. For large fixed instruments it is, of\r\ncourse, almost universally used; and in observatories the motion in\r\nRight Ascension, as it is called, which follows the star across the\r\nsky, is communicated to the driving-wheel of the polar axis by means\r\nof a clock which turns the rod carrying the tangent screw (Plate II.).\r\nThese are matters which in most circumstances are outside the sphere\r\nof the amateur; it may be interesting for him, however, to see\r\nexamples of the way in which large instruments are mounted. The\r\nfrontispiece, accordingly, shows the largest and most perfect\r\ninstrument at present in existence, while Plate II., with Figs. 4\r\nand 12, give further examples of fine modern work. The student can\r\nscarcely fail to be struck by the extreme solidity of the modern\r\nmountings, and by the way in which all the mechanical parts of the\r\ninstrument are so contrived as to give the greatest convenience\r\nand ease in working. Comparing, for instance, Plate II., a 6-inch\r\nrefractor by Messrs. Cooke, of York, available either for visual or\r\nphotographic work, with the Dorpat refractor (Fig. 3), it is seen that\r\nthe modern maker uses for a 6-inch telescope a stand much more\r\nsolid and steady than was deemed sufficient eighty years ago for an\r\ninstrument of 9-6/10 inches. Attention is particularly directed to the\r\nway in which nowadays all the motions are brought to the eye-end so\r\nas to be most convenient for the observer, and frequently, as in this\r\ncase, accomplished by electric power, while the declination circle is\r\nread by means of a small telescope so that the large instrument can\r\nbe directed upon any object with the minimum of trouble. The\r\ndriving clock, well shown on the right of the supporting pillar, is\r\nautomatically controlled by electric current from the sidereal clock\r\nof the observatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE II.\r\n\r\n6-inch Photo-Visual Refractor, equatorially mounted. Messrs. T. Cooke\r\n& Sons.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the reflecting form of telescope, which,\r\nespecially in this country, has deservedly gained much favour, and has\r\ncome to be regarded as in some sense the amateur's particular tool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--8-INCH REFRACTOR ON EQUATORIAL MOUNTING.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of policy, one can scarcely advise the beginner to make\r\nhis first essay with a reflector. Its adjustments, though simple\r\nenough, are apt to be troublesome at the time when everything has\r\nto be learned by experience; and its silver films, though much more\r\ndurable than is commonly supposed, are easily destroyed by careless\r\nor unskilful handling, and require more careful nursing than the\r\nobjective of a refractor. But, having once paid his first fees to\r\nexperience, the observer, if he feel so inclined, may venture upon a\r\nreflector, which has probably more than sufficient advantages to\r\nmake up for its weaker points. First and foremost of these advantages\r\nstands the not inconsiderable one of cheapness. A 10-1/2-inch\r\nreflector may be purchased new for rather less than the sum which will\r\nbuy a 4-inch refractor. True, the reflector has not the same command\r\nof light inch for inch as the refractor, but a reflector of 10-1/2\r\ninches should at least be the match of an 8-inch refractor in this\r\nrespect, and will be immeasurably more powerful than the 4-inch\r\nrefractor, which comes nearest to it in price. Second stands the ease\r\nand comfort so conspicuous in observing with a Newtonian. Instead\r\nof having almost to break his neck craning under the eye-piece of a\r\ntelescope pointed to near the zenith, the observer with a Newtonian\r\nlooks always straight in front of him, as the eye-piece of a reflector\r\nmounted as an altazimuth is always horizontal, and when the instrument\r\nis mounted equatorially, the tube, or its eye-end, is made to rotate\r\nso that the line of vision may be kept horizontal. Third is the\r\nabsence of colour. Colour is not conspicuous in a small refractor,\r\nunless the objective be of very bad quality; but as the aperture\r\nincreases it is apt to become somewhat painfully apparent. The\r\nreflector, on the other hand, is truly achromatic, and may be relied\r\nupon to show the natural tints of all objects with which it deals.\r\nThis point is of considerable importance in connection with planetary\r\nobservation. The colouring of Jupiter, for instance, will be seen in a\r\nreflector as a refractor can never show it.\r\n\r\nAgainst these advantages there have to be set certain disadvantages.\r\nFirst, the question of adjustments. A small refractor requires\r\npractically none; but a reflector, whatever its size, must be\r\noccasionally attended to, or else its mirrors will get out of square\r\nand bad performance will be the result. It is easy, however, to\r\nmake too much of this difficulty. The adjustments of the writer's\r\n8-1/2-inch With reflector have remained for months at a time as\r\nperfect as when they had been newly attended to. Second, the renewal\r\nof the silver films. This may cause some trouble in the neighbourhood\r\nof towns where the atmosphere is such as to tarnish silver quickly;\r\nand even in the country a film must be renewed at intervals. But these\r\nmay be long enough. The film on the mirror above referred to has stood\r\nwithout serious deterioration for five years at a time. Third, the\r\nreflector, with its open-mouthed tube, is undoubtedly more subject\r\nto disturbance from air currents and changes of temperature, and its\r\nmirrors take longer to settle down into good definition after the\r\ninstrument has been moved from one point of the sky to another. This\r\ndifficulty cannot be got over, and must be put up with; but it is not\r\nvery conspicuous with the smaller sizes of telescopes, such as are\r\nlikely to be in the hands of an amateur at the beginning of his work.\r\nThere are probably but few nights when an 8-1/2-inch reflector will\r\nnot give quite a good account of itself in this respect by comparison\r\nwith a refractor of anything like equal power. On the whole, the state\r\nof the question is this: If the observer wishes to have as much power\r\nas possible in proportion to his expenditure, and is not afraid to\r\ntake the risk of a small amount of trouble with the adjustments and\r\nfilms, the reflector is probably the instrument best suited to him.\r\nIf, on the other hand, he is so situated that his telescope has to be\r\nmuch moved, or, which is almost as bad, has to stand unused for any\r\nconsiderable intervals of time, he will be well advised to prefer\r\na refractor. One further advantage of the reflecting form is that,\r\naperture for aperture, it is very much shorter. The average refractor\r\nwill probably run to a length of from twelve to fifteen times the\r\ndiameter of its objective. Reflectors are rarely of a greater length\r\nthan nine times the diameter of the large mirror, and are frequently\r\nshorter still. Consequently, size for size, they can be worked in less\r\nspace, which is often a consideration of importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--FOUR-FOOT REFLECTOR EQUATORIALLY MOUNTED.]\r\n\r\nThe mountings of the reflector are in principle precisely similar to\r\nthose of the refractor already described. The greater weight, however,\r\nand the convenience of having the body of the instrument kept as low\r\nas possible, owing to the fact of the eye-piece being at the upper end\r\nof the tube, have necessitated various modifications in the forms to\r\nwhich these principles are applied. Plates III. and IV., and Fig. 13,\r\nillustrate the altazimuth and equatorial forms of mounting as applied\r\nto reflectors of various sizes, Fig. 13 being a representation of\r\nLassell's great 4-foot reflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE III.\r\n\r\n20-inch Reflector, Stanmore Observatory.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, having his telescope, whatever its size, principle, or\r\nform of mounting, the observer has to proceed to use it. Generally\r\nspeaking, there is no great difficulty in arriving at the manner of\r\nusing either a refractor or a reflector, and for either instrument\r\nthe details of handling must be learned by experience, as nearly all\r\nmakers have little variations of their own in the form of clamps and\r\nslow motions, though the principles in all instruments are the same.\r\nWith regard to these, the only recommendation that need be made is one\r\nof caution in the use of the glass until its ways of working have\r\nbeen gradually found out. With a knowledge of the principles of its\r\nconstruction and a little application of common-sense, there is no\r\npart of a telescope mounting which may not be readily understood.\r\nAccordingly, what follows must simply take the form of general hints\r\nas to matters which every telescopist ought to know, and which\r\nare easier learned once and for all at the beginning than by slow\r\nexperience. These hints are of course the very commonplaces of\r\nobservation; but it is the commonplace that is the foundation of good\r\nwork in everything.\r\n\r\nIf possible, let the telescope be fixed in the open air. Where\r\nmoney is no object, a few pounds will furnish a convenient little\r\ntelescope-house, with either a rotating or sliding roof, which enables\r\nthe instrument to be pointed to any quarter of the heavens. Such\r\nhouses are now much more easily obtained than they once were, and\r\nanyone who has tried both ways can testify how much handier it is to\r\nhave nothing to do but unlock the little observatory, and find the\r\ntelescope ready for work, than to have to carry a heavy instrument out\r\ninto the open. Plate IV. illustrates such a shelter, which has done\r\nduty for more than twelve years, covering an 8-1/2-inch With, whose\r\ntube and mounting are almost entirely the work of a local smith; and\r\nin the _Journal of the British Astronomical Association_, vol.\r\nxiv., p. 283, Mr. Edwin Holmes gives a simple description of a small\r\nobservatory which was put up at a cost of about £3, and has proved\r\nefficient and durable. The telescope-house has also the advantage\r\nof protecting the observer and his instrument from the wind, so that\r\nobservation may often be carried on on nights which would be quite too\r\nwindy for work in the open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nTelescope House and 8-1/2-inch 'with' Reflector.]\r\n\r\nShould it not be possible to obtain such a luxury, however,\r\nundoubtedly the next best is fairly outside. No one who has garden\r\nroom should ever think of observing from within doors. If the\r\ntelescope be used at an open window its definition will be impaired\r\nby air-currents. The floor of the room will communicate tremors to the\r\ninstrument, and every movement of the observer will be accompanied by\r\na corresponding movement of the object in the field, with results\r\nthat are anything but satisfactory. In some cases no other position is\r\navailable. If this be so, Webb's advice must be followed, the window\r\nopened as widely and as long beforehand as possible, and the telescope\r\nthrust out as far as is convenient. But these precautions only\r\npalliate the evils of indoor observation. The open air is the best,\r\nand with a little care in wrapping up the observer need run no risk.\r\n\r\nProvide the telescope, if a refractor, with a dew-cap. Without this\r\nprecaution dew is certain to gather upon the object-glass, with\r\nthe result of stopping all observation until it is removed, and the\r\naccompanying risk of damage to the objective itself. Some instruments\r\nare provided by their makers with dew-caps, and all ought to be; but\r\nin the absence of this provision a cap may be easily contrived. A\r\ntube of tin three or four times as long as the diameter of the\r\nobject-glass, made so as to slide fairly stiffly over the object end\r\nof the tube where the ordinary cap fits, and blackened inside to a\r\ndead black, will remove practically all risk. The blackening may be\r\ndone with lamp-black mixed with spirit varnish. Some makers--Messrs.\r\nCooke, of York, for instance--line both tube and dew-cap with black\r\nvelvet. This ought to be ideal, and might be tried in the case of the\r\ndew-cap by the observer. Finders are rarely fitted with dew-caps,\r\nbut certainly should be; the addition will often save trouble and\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nBe careful to cover up the objective or mirror with its proper cap\r\nbefore removing it into the house. If this is not done, dewing at once\r\nresults, the very proper punishment for carelessness. This may seem a\r\ncaution so elementary as scarcely to be worth giving; but it is easier\r\nto read and remember a hint than to have to learn by experience, which\r\nin the case of a reflector will almost certainly mean a deteriorated\r\nmirror film. Should the mirror, if you are using a reflector, become\r\ndewed in spite of all precautions, do not attempt to touch the film\r\nwhile it is moist, or you will have the pleasure of seeing it scale\r\noff under your touch. Bring it into a room of moderate temperature,\r\nor stand it in a through draught of dry air until the moisture\r\nevaporates; and should any stain be left, make sure that the mirror is\r\nabsolutely dry before attempting to polish it off. With regard to this\r\nmatter of polishing, touch the mirror as seldom as possible with the\r\npolishing-pad. Frequent polishing does far more harm than good, and\r\nthe mirror, if kept carefully covered when not in use, does not need\r\nit. A fold of cotton-wool between the cap and the mirror will, if\r\noccasionally taken out and dried, help greatly to preserve the film.\r\n\r\nNext comes a caution which beginners specially need. Almost everyone\r\non getting his first telescope wants to see everything as big as\r\npossible, and consequently uses the highest powers. This is an entire\r\nmistake. For a telescope of 2-1/2 inches aperture two eye-pieces,\r\nor at most three, are amply sufficient. Of these, one may be low in\r\npower, say 25 to 40, to take in large fields, and, if necessary, to\r\nserve in place of a finder. Such an eye-piece will give many star\r\npictures of surprising beauty. Another may be of medium power, say 80,\r\nfor general work; and a third may be as high as 120 for exceptionally\r\nfine nights and for work on double stars. Nominally a 2-1/2 inch, if\r\nof very fine quality, should bear on the finest nights and on stars\r\na power of 100 to the inch, or 250. Practically it will do nothing\r\nof the sort, and on most nights the half of this power will be found\r\nrather too high. Indeed, the use of high powers is for many reasons\r\nundesirable. A certain proportion of light to size must be preserved\r\nin the image, or it will appear faint and 'clothy.' Further, increased\r\nmagnifying power means also increased magnification of every tremor of\r\nthe atmosphere; and with high powers the object viewed passes through\r\nthe field so rapidly that constant shifting of the telescope is\r\nrequired, and only a brief glimpse can be obtained before the\r\ninstrument has to be moved again. It is infinitely more satisfactory\r\nto see your object of a moderate size and steady than to see it much\r\nlarger, but hazy, tremulous, and in rapid motion. 'In inquiring about\r\nthe quality of some particular instrument,' remarks Sir Howard Grubb,\r\n'a tyro almost invariably asks, \"What is the highest power you can\r\nuse?\" An experienced observer will ask, \"What is the lowest power with\r\nwhich you can do so and so?\"'\r\n\r\nDo not be disappointed if your first views of celestial objects do not\r\ncome up to your expectations. They seldom do, particularly in respect\r\nof the size which the planets present in the field. A good deal of\r\nthe discouragement so often experienced is due to the idea that the\r\nillustrations in text-books represent what ought to be seen by anyone\r\nwho looks through a telescope. It has to be remembered that these\r\npictures are, for one thing, drawn to a large scale, in order to\r\ninsure clearness in detail, that they are in general the results of\r\nobservation with the very finest telescopes, and the work of skilled\r\nobservers making the most of picked nights. No one would expect to\r\nrival a trained craftsman in a first attempt at his trade; yet most\r\npeople seem to think that they ought to be able at their first essay\r\nin telescopic work to see and depict as much as men who have\r\nspent half a lifetime in an apprenticeship to the delicate art of\r\nobservation. Given time, patience, and perseverance, and the skill\r\nwill come. The finest work shown in good drawings represents, not\r\nwhat the beginner may expect to see at his first view, but a standard\r\ntowards which he must try to work by steady practice both of eye and\r\nhand. In this connection it may be suggested that the observer should\r\ntake advantage of every opportunity of seeing through larger and finer\r\ninstruments than his own. This will teach him two things at least.\r\nFirst, to respect his own small telescope, as he sees how bravely it\r\nstands up to the larger instrument so far as regards the prominent\r\nfeatures of the celestial bodies; and, second, to notice how the\r\nsuperior power of the large glass brings out nothing startlingly\r\ndifferent from that which is shown by his own small one, but a wealth\r\nof delicate detail which must be looked for (compare Plate XV. with\r\nFig. 22). A little occasional practice with a large instrument will be\r\nfound a great encouragement and a great help to working with a small\r\none, and most possessors of large glasses are more than willing to\r\nassist the owners of small ones.\r\n\r\nDo not be ashamed to draw what you see, whether it be little or much,\r\nand whether you can draw well or ill. At the worst the result will\r\nhave an interest to yourself which no representation by another hand\r\ncan ever possess; at the best your drawings may in course of time come\r\nto be of real scientific value. There are few observers who cannot\r\nmake some shape at a representation of what they see, and steady\r\npractice often effects an astonishing improvement. But draw only what\r\nyou see with certainty. Some observers are gifted with abnormal powers\r\nof vision, others with abnormal powers of imagination. Strange to say,\r\nthe results attained by these two classes differ widely in appearance\r\nand in value. You may not be endowed with faculties which will enable\r\nyou to take rank in the former class; but at least you need not\r\ndescend to the latter. It is after all a matter of conscience.\r\n\r\nDo not be too hasty in supposing that everybody is endowed with a zeal\r\nfor astronomy equal to your own. The average man or woman does not\r\nenjoy being called out from a warm fireside on a winter's night, no\r\nmatter how beautiful the celestial sight to be seen. Your friend\r\nmay politely express interest, but to tempt him to this is merely to\r\nencourage a habit of untruthfulness. The cause of astronomy is not\r\nlikely to be furthered by being associated in any person's mind with\r\ndiscomfort and a boredom which is not less real because it is veiled\r\nunder quite inadequate forms of speech. It is better to wait until the\r\nother man's own curiosity suggests a visit to the telescope, if you\r\nwish to gain a convert to the science.\r\n\r\nWhen observing in the open be sure to wrap up well. A heavy ulster or\r\nits equivalent, and some form of covering for the feet which will keep\r\nthem warm, are absolute essentials. See that you are thoroughly warm\r\nbefore you go out. In all probability you will be cold enough before\r\nwork is over; but there is no reason why you should make yourself\r\nmiserable from the beginning, and so spoil your enjoyment of a fine\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied his craving for a general survey of everything in\r\nthe heavens that comes within the range of his glass, the beginner\r\nis strongly advised to specialize. This is a big word to apply to the\r\nusing of a 2-1/2- or 3-inch telescope, but it represents the only\r\nway in which interest can be kept up. It does no good, either to\r\nthe observer or to the science of astronomy, for him to take out\r\nhis glass, have a glance at Jupiter and another at the Orion nebula,\r\nsatisfy himself that the two stars of Castor are still two, wander\r\nover a few bright clusters, and then turn in, to repeat the same\r\ndreary process the next fine night. Let him make up his mind to stick\r\nto one, or at most two, objects. Lunar work presents an attractive\r\nfield for a small instrument, and may be followed on useful lines, as\r\nwill be pointed out later. A spell of steady work upon Jupiter will at\r\nleast prepare the way and whet the appetite for a glass more adequate\r\nto deal with the great planet. Should star work be preferred, a fine\r\nfield is opened up in connection with the variable stars, the chief\r\nrequirement of work in this department being patience and regularity,\r\na small telescope being quite competent to deal with a very large\r\nnumber of interesting objects.\r\n\r\nThe following comments in Smyth's usual pungent style are worth\r\nremembering: 'The furor of a green astronomer is to possess himself\r\nof all sorts of instruments--to make observations upon everything--and\r\nattempt the determination of quantities which have been again and\r\nagain determined by competent persons, with better means, and\r\nmore practical acquaintance with the subject. He starts with an\r\nenthusiastic admiration of the science, and the anticipation of new\r\ndiscoveries therein; and all the errors consequent upon the momentary\r\nimpulses of what Bacon terms \"affected dispatch\" crowd upon him. Under\r\nthis course--as soon as the more hacknied objects are \"seen up\"--and\r\nhe can decide whether some are greenish-blue or bluish-green--the\r\nexcitement flags, the study palls, and the zeal evaporates in\r\nhyper-criticism on the instruments and their manufacturers.'\r\n\r\nThis is a true sketch of the natural history, or rather, of the\r\ndecline and fall, of many an amateur observer. But there is no reason\r\nwhy so ignominious an end should ever overtake any man's pursuit of\r\nthe study if he will only choose one particular line and make it his\r\nown, and be thorough in it. Half-study inevitably ends in weariness\r\nand disgust; but the man who will persevere never needs to complain of\r\nsameness in any branch of astronomical work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom its comparative nearness, its brightness and size, and its\r\nsupreme importance to ourselves, the sun commands our attention; and\r\nin the phenomena which it presents there is found a source of abundant\r\nand constantly varying interest. Observation of these phenomena can\r\nonly be conducted, however, after due precautions have been taken. Few\r\npeople have any idea of the intense glow of the solar light and heat\r\nwhen concentrated by the object-glass of even a small telescope, and\r\ncare must be exercised lest irreparable damage be done to the eye.\r\nGalileo is said to have finally blinded himself altogether, and\r\nSir William Herschel to have seriously impaired his sight by solar\r\nobservation. No danger need be feared if one or other of the common\r\nprecautions be adopted, and some of these will be shortly described;\r\nbut before we consider these and the means of applying them, let us\r\ngather together briefly the main facts about the sun itself.\r\n\r\nOur sun, then, is a body of about 866,000 miles in diameter, and\r\nsituated at a distance of some 92,700,000 miles from us. In bulk\r\nit equals 1,300,000 of our world, while it would take about 332,000\r\nearths to weigh it down. Its density, as can be seen from these\r\nfigures, is very small indeed. Bulk for bulk, it is considerably\r\nlighter than the earth; in fact, it is not very much denser than\r\nwater, and this has very considerable bearing upon our ideas of its\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nNatural operations are carried on in this immense globe upon a scale\r\nwhich it is almost impossible for us to realize. A few illustrations\r\ngathered from Young's interesting volume, 'The Sun,' may help to\r\nmake clearer to us the scale of the ruling body of our system. Some\r\nconception of the immensity of its distance from us may first be\r\ngained from Professor Mendenhall's whimsical illustration. Sensation,\r\naccording to Helmholtz's experiments, travels at a rate of about 100\r\nfeet per second. If, then, an infant were born with an arm long enough\r\nto reach to the sun, and if on his birthday he were to exercise this\r\namazing limb by putting his finger upon the solar surface, he would\r\ndie in blissful ignorance of the fact that he had been burned, for\r\nthe sensation of burning would take 150 years to travel along that\r\nstupendous arm. Were the sun hollowed out like a gigantic indiarubber\r\nball and the earth placed at its centre, the enclosing shell would\r\nappear like a far distant sky to us. Our moon would have room to\r\ncircle within this shell at its present distance of 240,000 miles, and\r\nthere would still be room for another satellite to move in an orbit\r\nexterior to that of the moon at a further distance of more than\r\n190,000 miles. The attractive power of this great body is no less\r\namazing than its bulk. It has been calculated that were the attractive\r\npower which keeps our earth coursing in its orbit round the sun to\r\ncease, and to be replaced by a material bond consisting of steel wires\r\nof a thickness equal to that of the heaviest telegraph-wires, these\r\nwould require to cover the whole sunward side of our globe in the\r\nproportion of nine to each square inch. The force of gravity at the\r\nsolar surface is such that a man who on the earth weighs 10 stone\r\nwould, if transported to the sun, weigh nearly 2 tons, and, if he\r\nremained of the same strength as on earth, would be crushed by his own\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE V.\r\n\r\nThe Sun, February 3, 1905. Royal Observatory, Greenwich.]\r\n\r\nThe first telescopic view of the sun is apt, it must be confessed,\r\nto be a disappointment. The moon is certainly a much more attractive\r\nsubject for a casual glance. Its craters and mountain ranges catch\r\nthe eye at once, while the solar disc presents an appearance of almost\r\nunbroken uniformity. Soon, however, it will become evident that the\r\nuniformity is only apparent. Generally speaking, the surface will\r\nquickly be seen to be broken up by one or more dark spots (Plate V.),\r\nwhich present an apparently black centre and a sort of grey shading\r\nround about this centre. The margin of the disc will be seen to be\r\nnotably less bright than its central portions; and near the margin,\r\nand oftenest, though not invariably, in connection with one of the\r\ndark spots, there will be markings of a brilliant white, and often of\r\na fantastically branched shape, which seem elevated above the general\r\nsurface; while as the eye becomes more used to its work it will be\r\nfound that even a small telescope brings out a kind of mottled or\r\ncurdled appearance over the whole disc. This last feature may often\r\nbe more readily seen by moving the telescope so as to cause the solar\r\nimage to sweep across the field of view, or by gently tapping the\r\ntube so as to cause a slight vibration. Specks of dirt which may have\r\ngathered upon the field lens of the eye-piece will also be seen; but\r\nthese may be distinguished from the spots by moving the telescope\r\na little, when they will shift their place relatively to the other\r\nfeatures; and their exhibition may serve to suggest the propriety of\r\nkeeping eye-pieces as clean as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Bridged Sunspot (Janssen). _Knowledge_, February, 1890.]\r\n\r\nThe spots when more closely examined will be found to present\r\nendless irregularities in outline and size, as will be seen from the\r\naccompanying plates and figures. On the whole, there is comparative\r\nfidelity to two main features--a dark central nucleus, known as the\r\numbra, and a lighter border, the penumbra; but sometimes there are\r\numbræ which have no penumbra, and sometimes there are spots which can\r\nscarcely be called more than penumbral shadings. The shape of the spot\r\nis sometimes fairly symmetrical; at other times the most fantastic\r\nforms appear. The umbra appears dark upon the bright disc, but is in\r\nreality of dazzling lustre, sending to us, according to Langley, 54\r\nper cent. of the amount of heat received from a corresponding area of\r\nthe brilliant unspotted surface. Within the umbra a yet darker deep,\r\nif it be a deep, has been detected by various observers, but is\r\nscarcely likely to be seen with the small optical means which we are\r\ncontemplating. The penumbra is very much lighter in colour than the\r\numbra, and invariably presents a streaked appearance, the lines all\r\nrunning in towards the umbra, and resembling very much the edge of a\r\nthatched roof. It will be seen to be very much lighter in colour on\r\nthe edge next the umbra, while it shades to a much darker tone on\r\nthat side which is next to the bright undisturbed part of the surface\r\n(Figs. 14 and 15). Frequently a spot will be seen interrupted by a\r\nbright projection from the luminous surface surrounding it which may\r\neven extend from side to side of the spot, forming a bridge across\r\nit (Plate VI., and Figs. 16, 17, and 18). These are the outstanding\r\nfeatures of the solar spots, and almost any telescope is competent to\r\nreveal them. But these appearances have to be interpreted, so far as\r\nthat is possible, and to have some scale applied to them before their\r\nsignificance can in the least be recognised. The observer will do\r\nwell to make some attempt at realizing the enormous actual size of the\r\nseemingly trifling details which his instrument shows. For example,\r\nthe spot in Figs. 14 and 15 is identical with that measured by Mr.\r\nDenning on the day between the dates of my rough sketches; and its\r\ngreatest diameter was then 27,143 miles. Spots such as those of 1858,\r\nof February, 1892, and February, 1904, have approached or exceeded\r\n140,000 miles in diameter, while others have been frequently recorded,\r\nwhich, though not to be compared to these leviathans, have yet\r\nmeasured from 40,000 to 50,000 miles in diameter, with umbræ of 25,000\r\nto 30,000 miles. Of course, the accurate measurement of the spots\r\ndemands appliances which are not likely to be in a beginner's hands;\r\nbut there are various ways of arriving at an approximation which is\r\nquite sufficient for the purpose in view--namely, a realization of\r\nthe scale of any spot as compared with that of the sun or of our own\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--SUN-SPOT, JUNE 18, 1889.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--SUN-SPOT, JUNE 20, 1889.]\r\n\r\nOf these methods, the simplest on the whole seems to be that given\r\nby Mr. W. F. Denning in his admirable volume, 'Telescopic Work for\r\nStarlight Evenings.' Fasten on the diaphragm of an eye-piece (the\r\nblackened brass disc with a central hole which lies between the field\r\nand eye lenses of the eye-piece) a pair of fine wires at right angles\r\nto one another. Bring the edge of the sun up to the vertical wire, the\r\neye-piece being so adjusted that the sun's motion is along the line\r\nof the horizontal wire. This can easily be accomplished by turning the\r\neye-piece round until the solar motion follows the line of the wire.\r\nThen note the number of seconds which the whole disc of the sun takes\r\nto cross the vertical wire. Note, in the second place, the time which\r\nthe spot to be measured takes to cross the vertical wire; and, having\r\nthese two numbers, a simple rule of three sum enables the diameter of\r\nthe spot to be roughly ascertained. For the sun's diameter, 866,000\r\nmiles, is known, and the proportion which it bears to the number of\r\nseconds which it takes to cross the wire will be the same as that\r\nborne by the spot to its time of transit. Thus, to take Mr. Denning's\r\nexample, if the sun takes 133 seconds to cross the wire, and the spot\r\ntakes 6·5, then 133: 866,000::6·5:42,323, which latter number will be,\r\nroughly speaking, the diameter of the spot in miles. This, method\r\nis only a very rough approximation; still, it at least enables the\r\nobserver to form some conception of the scale of what is being seen.\r\nIt will answer best when the sun is almost south, and is, of course,\r\nless and less accurate as the spot in question is removed from\r\nthe centre of the disc; for the sun being a sphere, and not a flat\r\nsurface, foreshortening comes largely and increasingly into play as\r\nspots near the edge (or limb) of the disc.\r\n\r\nContinued observation will speedily lead to the detection of the\r\nexceedingly rapid changes which often affect the spots and their\r\nneighbourhood. There are instances in which a spot passes across the\r\ndisc without any other apparent changes save those which are due to\r\nperspective; and the same spot may even accomplish a complete rotation\r\nand appear again with but little change. But, generally speaking, it\r\nwill be noticed that the average spot changes very considerably during\r\nthe course of a single rotation. Often, indeed, the changes are so\r\nrapid as to be apparent within the course of a few hours. Figs. 14\r\nand 15 represent a spot which was seen on June 18 and 20, 1889, and\r\nsketched by means of a 2-1/2-inch refractor with a power of 80. A\r\ncertain proportion of the change noticeable is due to perspective, but\r\nthere are also changes of considerable importance in the structure\r\nof the spot which are actual, and due to motion of its parts. Mr.\r\nDenning's drawing ('Telescopic Work,' p. 95) shows the spot on the day\r\nbetween these two representations, and exhibits an intermediate stage\r\nof the change. The late Professor Langley has stated that when he was\r\nmaking the exquisite drawing of a typical sun-spot which has become so\r\nfamiliar to all readers of astronomical text-books and periodicals,\r\na portion of the spot equal in area to the continent of South America\r\nchanged visibly during the time occupied in the execution of the\r\ndrawing; and this is only one out of many records of similar tenor.\r\nIndeed, no one who has paid any attention to solar observation can\r\nfail to have had frequent instances of change on a very large scale\r\nbrought under his notice; and when the reality of such change has been\r\nactually witnessed, it brings home to the mind, as no amount of mere\r\nstatement can, the extraordinary mobility of the solar surface, and\r\nthe fact that we are here dealing with a body where the conditions are\r\nradically different from those with which we are familiar on our own\r\nglobe. Changes which involve the complete alteration in appearance\r\nof areas of many thousand square miles have to be taken into\r\nconsideration as things of common occurrence upon the sun, and must\r\nvitally affect our ideas of his constitution and structure (Figs. 16,\r\n17, 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--SUN-SPOT SEEN IN 1870.]\r\n\r\nLittle more can be done by ordinary observation with regard to the\r\nspots and the general surface. Common instruments are not likely to\r\nhave much chance with the curious structure into which the coarse\r\nmottling of the disc breaks up when viewed under favourable\r\ncircumstances. This structure, compared by Nasmyth to willow-leaves,\r\nand by others to rice-grains, is beautifully seen in a number of the\r\nphotographs taken by Janssen and others; but it is seldom that it can\r\nbe seen to full advantage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--ANOTHER PHASE OF SPOT (FIG. 16).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--PHASE OF SPOT (FIGS. 16 AND 17).]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the spots afford a ready means by which the\r\nobserver may for himself determine approximately the rotation period\r\nof the sun. A spot will generally appear to travel across the solar\r\ndisc in about 13 days 14-1/2 hours, and to reappear at the eastern\r\nlimb after a similar lapse of time, thus making the apparent\r\nrotation-period 27 days 5 hours. This has to be corrected, as the\r\nearth's motion round the sun causes an apparent slackening in the rate\r\nof the spots, and a deduction of about 2 days has to be made for this\r\nreason, the resulting period being about 25 days 7 hours. It will\r\nquickly be found that no single spot can be relied upon to give\r\nanything like a precise determination, as many have motions of their\r\nown independent of that due to the sun's rotation; and, in addition,\r\nthere has been shown to be a gradual lengthening of the period in high\r\nlatitudes. Thus, spots near the equator yield a period of 25·09 days,\r\nthose in latitude 15° N. or S. one of 25·44, and those in latitude 30°\r\none of 26·53.\r\n\r\nThis law of increase, first established by Carrington, has been\r\nconfirmed by the spectroscopic measures of Dunér at Upsala. His\r\nperiods, while uniformly in excess of those derived from ordinary\r\nobservations, show the same progression. For 0° his period is 25·46\r\ndays, for 15° 26·35, and for 30° 27·57. Continuing his researches up\r\nto 15° from the solar pole, Dunér has found that at that point the\r\nperiod of rotation is protracted to 38.5 days.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the bright and fantastically\r\nbranched features which diversify the solar surface, generally\r\nappearing in connection with the spots, and best seen near the limb,\r\nthough existing over the whole disc. These 'faculæ,' as they are\r\ncalled, will be readily seen with a small instrument--I have seen them\r\neasily with a 2-inch finder and a power of 30. They suggest at once to\r\nthe eye the idea that they are elevations above the general surface,\r\nand look almost like waves thrown up by the convulsions which\r\nproduce the spots. The rotation-period given by them has also been\r\nascertained, and the result is shorter than that given by the spots.\r\nIn latitude 0° it is 24·66 days, at 15° it is 25·26, at 30° 25·48.\r\nThese varieties of rotation show irresistibly that the sun cannot\r\nin any sense of the term be called a rigid body. As Professor Holden\r\nremarks: 'It is more like a vast whirlpool, where the velocities of\r\nrotation depend on the situation of the rotating masses, not only as\r\nto latitude, but also as to depth beneath the rotating surface.' Plate\r\nVII., from a photograph of the sun taken by Mr. Hale, in which the\r\nsurface is portrayed by the light of one single calcium ray of the\r\nsolar spectrum, presents a view of the mottled appearance of the disc,\r\ntogether with several bright forms which the author of the photograph\r\nconsiders to be faculæ. M. Deslandres, of the Meudon Observatory, who\r\nhas also been very successful in this new branch of solar photography,\r\nconsiders, however, that these forms are not faculæ, but distinct\r\nphenomena, to which he proposes to assign the name 'faculides'; and\r\nfor various reasons his view appears to be the more probable. They\r\nare, however, in any case, in close relation with the faculæ, and, as\r\nMiss Clerke observes, 'symptoms of the same disturbance.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nSolar Surface with Faculæ. Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the nature of the sun spots is one that at once\r\nsuggests itself; but it must be confessed that no very satisfactory\r\nanswer can yet be given to it. None of the many theories put forward\r\nhave covered all the observed facts, and an adequate solution seems\r\nalmost as far off as ever. No one can fail to be struck with the\r\nresemblance which the spots present to cavities in the solar surface.\r\nInstinctively the mind seems to regard the umbra of the spot as being\r\nthe centre of a great hollow of which the penumbra represents the\r\nsloping sides; and for long it was generally held that Wilson's\r\ntheory, which assumed this appearance to correspond to an actual fact,\r\nwas correct. Wilson found by observation of certain spots that when\r\nthe spot was nearest to one limb the penumbra disappeared, either\r\naltogether or in part, on the side towards the centre, and that this\r\nprocess was reversed as the spot approached the opposite limb, the\r\nportion of the penumbra nearest the centre of the disc being always\r\nthe narrowest.\r\n\r\nThis is the order of appearances which would naturally follow if the\r\nspot in question were a cavity; and if it were invariable there could\r\nscarcely be any doubt as to its significance. But while the Wilsonian\r\ntheory has been recognised in all the text-books for many years,\r\nthere has always been a suspicion that it was by no means adequately\r\nestablished, and that it was too wide an inference from the number of\r\ncases observed; and of late years it has been falling more and more\r\ninto discredit. Howlett, for example, an observer of great experience,\r\nhas asserted that the appearances on which the theory is based are not\r\nthe rule, but the exception, and that therefore it must be given up.\r\nNumbers of spots seem to present the appearance of elevations rather\r\nthan of depressions, and altogether it seems as though no category has\r\nyet been attained which will embrace all the varieties of spot-form.\r\nOn this point further observation is very much needed, and the\r\nwork that has to be done is well within the reach of even moderate\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe fact that sun-spots wax and wane in numbers in a certain definite\r\nperiod was first ascertained by the amateur observer Schwabe of\r\nDessau, whose work is a notable example of what may be accomplished by\r\nsteadfast devotion to one particular branch of research. Without any\r\ngreat instrumental equipment, Schwabe effected the discovery of\r\nthis most important fact--a discovery second to none made in the\r\nastronomical field during the last century--simply by the patient\r\nrecording of the state of the sun's face for a period of over thirty\r\nyears, during which he succeeded in securing an observation, on the\r\naverage, on about 300 days out of every year. The period now accepted\r\ndiffers slightly from that assigned by him, and amounts to 11·11\r\nyears. Beginning with a minimum, when few spots or none may be visible\r\nfor some time, the spots will be found to increase gradually in\r\nnumber, until, about four and a half years from the minimum, a maximum\r\nis reached; and from this point diminution sets in, and results,\r\nin about 6·6 years, in a second minimum. The period is not one\r\nof absolute regularity--a maximum or a minimum may sometimes\r\nlag considerably behind its proper time, owing to causes as yet\r\nunexplained. Still, on the whole, the agreement is satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThis variation is also accompanied by a variation in the latitude of\r\nthe spots. Generally they follow certain definite zones, mostly lying\r\nbetween 10° and 35° on either side of the solar equator. As a minimum\r\napproaches, they tend to appear nearer to the equator than usual; and\r\nwhen the minimum has passed the reappearance of the spots takes the\r\nopposite course, beginning in high latitudes.\r\n\r\nIt has further been ascertained that a close connection exists between\r\nthe activity which results in the formation of sun-spots, and the\r\nelectrical phenomena of our earth. Instances of this connection have\r\nbeen so repeatedly observed as to leave no doubt of its reality,\r\nthough the explanation of it has still to be found. It has been\r\nsuggested by Young that there may be immediate and direct action in\r\nthis respect between the sun and the earth, an action perhaps kindred\r\nwith that solar repulsive force which seems to drive off the material\r\nof a comet's tail. As yet not satisfactorily accounted for is the fact\r\nthat it does not always follow that the appearance of a great sun-spot\r\nis answered by a magnetic storm on the earth. On the average the\r\nconnection is established; but there are many individual instances\r\nof sun-spots occurring without any answering magnetic thrill from the\r\nearth. To meet this difficulty, Mr. E. W. Maunder has proposed a view\r\nof the sun's electrical influence upon our earth, which, whether it\r\nbe proved or disproved in the future, seems at present the most living\r\nattempt to account for the observed facts. Briefly, he considers it\r\nindubitably proved--\r\n\r\n  1. That our magnetic disturbances are connected with the sun.\r\n\r\n  2. That the sun's action, of whatever nature, is not from the sun as\r\n     a whole, but from restricted areas.\r\n\r\n  3. That the sun's action is not radiated, but restricted in\r\n     direction.\r\n\r\nOn his view, the great coronal rays or streamers seen in total\r\neclipses (Plate VIII.) are lines of force, and similarly the magnetic\r\ninfluence which the sun exerts upon the earth acts along definite and\r\nrestricted lines. Thus a disturbance of great magnitude upon the sun\r\nwould only be followed by a corresponding disturbance on the earth\r\nif the latter happened to be at or near the point where it would fall\r\nwithin the sweep of the line of magnetic force emanating from the\r\nsun. In proportion as the line of magnetic force approached to falling\r\nperpendicularly on the earth, the magnetic disturbance would be large:\r\nin proportion as it departed from the perpendicular it would diminish\r\nuntil it vanished finally altogether. The suggestion seems an inviting\r\none, and has at least revived very considerably the interest in these\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the solar features which offer themselves to direct\r\nobservation by means of a small telescope. The spots, apart from their\r\nown intrinsic interest, are seen to furnish a fairly accurate method\r\nby which the observer can determine for himself the sun's rotation\r\nperiod. Their size may be approximately measured, thus conveying to\r\nthe mind some idea of the enormous magnitude of the convulsions which\r\ntake place upon this vast globe. The spot zones may be noted, together\r\nwith the gradual shift in latitude as the period approaches or recedes\r\nfrom minimum; while observations of individual spots may be conducted\r\nwith a view to gathering evidence which shall help either to confirm\r\nor to confute the Wilsonian theory. In this latter department of\r\nobservation the main requisite is that the work should be done\r\nsystematically. Irregular observation is of little or no value; but\r\nsteady work may yield results of high importance. While, however,\r\nsystematic observation is desirable, it is not everyone who has the\r\ntime or the opportunity to give this; and to many of us daily solar\r\nobservation may represent an unattainable ideal. Even if this be the\r\ncase, there still remains an inexhaustible fund of beauty and interest\r\nin the sun-spots. It does not take regular observation to enable one\r\nto be interested in the most wonderful intricacy and beauty of the\r\nsolar detail, in its constant changes, and in the ideas which even\r\ncasual work cannot fail to suggest as to the nature and mystery of\r\nthat great orb which is of such infinite importance to ourselves.\r\n\r\nA small instrument, used in the infrequent intervals which may be all\r\nthat can be snatched from the claims of other work, will give the\r\nuser a far more intelligent interest in the sun, and a far better\r\nappreciation of its features, than can be gained by the most careful\r\nstudy of books. In this, and in all other departments of astronomy,\r\nthere is nothing like a little practical work to give life to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of observation, however, regard must be paid to the\r\ncaution given at the beginning of this chapter. Various methods have\r\nbeen adopted for minimizing the intense glare and heat. For small\r\ntelescopes--up to 2-1/2 inches or so--the common device of the\r\ninterposition of a coloured glass between the eye-piece and the eye\r\nwill generally be found sufficient on the score of safety, though\r\nother arrangements may be found preferable. Such glasses are usually\r\nsupplied with small instruments, mounted in brass caps which screw or\r\nslide on to the ends of the various eye-pieces. Neutral tint is\r\nthe best, though a combination of green and red also does well.\r\nRed transmits too much heat for comfort. Should dark glasses not be\r\nsupplied, it is easy to make them by smoking a piece of glass to the\r\nrequired depth, protecting it from rubbing by fastening over it a\r\ncovering glass which rests at each end on a narrow strip of cardboard.\r\n\r\nWith anything larger than 2-1/2 inches, dark glass is never quite\r\nsafe. A 3-inch refractor will be found quite capable of cracking and\r\ndestroying even a fairly thick glass if observation be long continued.\r\nThe contrivance known as a polarizing eye-piece was formerly pretty\r\nmuch beyond the reach of the average amateur by reason of its\r\ncostliness. Such eye-pieces are now becoming much cheaper, and\r\ncertainly afford a most safe and pleasant way of viewing the sun. They\r\nare so arranged that the amount of light and heat transmitted can be\r\nreduced at will, so as to render the use of a dark glass unnecessary,\r\nthus enabling the observer to see all details in their natural\r\ncolouring. The ordinary solar diagonal, in which the bulk of the rays\r\nis rejected, leaving only a small portion to reach the eye, is cheaper\r\nand satisfactory, though a light screen-glass is still required with\r\nit. But unquestionably the best general method of observing, and also\r\nthe least costly, is that of projecting the sun's image through the\r\ntelescope upon a prepared white surface, which may be of paper, or\r\nanything else that may be found suitable.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this a light framework may be constructed in the shape\r\nof a truncated cone. At its narrow end it slips or screws on to the\r\neye-end of the telescope, and it may be made of any length required,\r\nin proportion to the size of solar disc which it is desired to obtain.\r\nIt should be covered with black cloth, and its base may be a board\r\nwith white paper stretched on it to receive the image, which is viewed\r\nthrough a small door in the side. In place of the board with white\r\npaper, other expedients may be tried. Noble recommends a surface of\r\nplaster of Paris, smoothed while wet on plate glass, and this is very\r\ngood if you can get the plaster smooth enough. I have found white\r\npaint, laid pretty thickly on glass and then rubbed down to a smooth\r\nmatt surface by means of cuttle-fish bone, give very satisfactory\r\nresults. Should it be desired to exhibit the sun's image to several\r\npeople at once, this can easily be done by projecting it upon a sheet\r\nof paper fastened on a drawing-board, and supported at right angles to\r\nthe telescope by an easel. The framework, or whatever takes its place,\r\nbeing in position, the telescope is pointed at the sun by means of\r\nits shadow; when this is perfectly round, or when the shadow of the\r\nframework perfectly corresponds to the shape of its larger end, the\r\nsun's image should be in the field of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SUN'S SURROUNDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the point beyond which mere telescopic power will\r\nnot carry us, a point as definite for the largest instrument as for\r\nthe smallest. We have traced what can be seen on the visible sun, but\r\nbeyond the familiar disc, and invisible at ordinary seasons or with\r\npurely telescopic means, there lie several solar features of the\r\nutmost interest and beauty, the study of which very considerably\r\nmodifies our conception of the structure of our system's ruler. These\r\nfeatures are only revealed in all their glory and wonder during the\r\nfleeting moments in which a total eclipse is central to any particular\r\nportion of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nA solar eclipse is caused by the fact that the moon, in her revolution\r\nround the earth, comes at certain periods between us and the sun, and\r\nobscures the light of the latter body either partially or totally.\r\nOwing to the fact that the plane of the orbit in which the moon\r\nrevolves round the earth does not coincide with that in which the\r\nearth revolves round the sun, the eclipse is generally only partial,\r\nthe moon not occupying the exact line between the centres of the sun\r\nand the earth. The dark body of the moon then appears to cut off a\r\ncertain portion, larger or smaller, of the sun's light; but none of\r\nthe extraordinary phenomena to be presently described are witnessed.\r\nEven during a partial eclipse, however, the observer may find\r\nconsiderable interest in watching the outline of the dark moon, as\r\nprojected upon the bright background of the sun. It is frequently\r\njagged or serrated, the projections indicating the existence, on the\r\nmargin of the lunar globe, of lofty mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--ECLIPSES OF THE SUN AND MOON.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the conditions are such that the moon comes centrally\r\nbetween the earth and the sun (Fig. 19), and then an eclipse occurs\r\nwhich may be either total or annular. The proportion between the\r\nrespective distances from us of the sun and the moon is such that\r\nthese two bodies, so vastly different in real bulk, are sensibly the\r\nsame in apparent diameter, so that a very slight modification of the\r\nmoon's distance is sufficient to reduce her diameter below that of\r\nthe sun. The lunar orbit is not quite circular, but has a small\r\neccentricity. It may therefore happen that an eclipse occurs when the\r\nmoon is nearest the earth, at which point she will cover the sun's\r\ndisc with a little to spare; or the eclipse may occur when she is\r\nfurthest away from the earth, in which case the lunar diameter will\r\nappear less than that of the sun, and the eclipse will be only an\r\nannular one, and a bright ring or 'annulus' of sunlight will be seen\r\nsurrounding the dark body of the moon at the time when the eclipse is\r\ncentral.\r\n\r\nAll conditions being favourable, however--that is to say, the eclipse\r\nbeing central, and the moon at such a position in her orbit as to\r\npresent a diameter equal to, or slightly greater than, that of the\r\nsun--a picture of extraordinary beauty and wonder reveals itself the\r\nmoment that totality has been established. The centre of the view is\r\nthe black disc of the moon. From behind it on every side there streams\r\nout a wonderful halo of silvery light which in some of its furthest\r\nstreamers may sometimes extend to a distance of several million\r\nmiles. In the Indian Eclipse of 1898, for example, one streamer was\r\nphotographed by Mrs. Maunder, which extended to nearly six diameters\r\nfrom the limb of the eclipsed sun (Plate VIII.). The structure of this\r\nsilvery halo is of the most remarkable complexity, and appears to be\r\nsubject to continual variations, which have already been ascertained\r\nto be to some extent periodical and in sympathy with the sun-spot\r\nperiod. At its inner margin this halo rests upon a ring of crimson\r\nfire which extends completely round the sun, and throws up here and\r\nthere great jets or waves, which frequently assume the most fantastic\r\nforms and rise to heights varying from 20,000 to 100,000 miles, or\r\nin extreme instances to a still greater height. To these appearances\r\nastronomers have given the names of the Corona, the Chromosphere, and\r\nthe Prominences. The halo of silvery light is the Corona, the ring\r\nof crimson fire the Chromosphere, and the jets or waves are the\r\nProminences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nCoronal Streamers: Eclipse of 1898. From Photographs by Mrs. Maunder.]\r\n\r\nThe Corona is perhaps the most mysterious of all the sun's\r\nsurroundings. As yet its nature remains undetermined, though the\r\nobservations which have been made at every eclipse since attention was\r\nfirst directed to it have been gradually suggesting and strengthening\r\nthe idea that there exists a very close analogy between the coronal\r\nstreamers and the Aurora or the tails of comets. The extreme rarity\r\nof its substance is conclusively proved by the fact that such\r\ninsubstantial things as comets pass through it apparently unresisted\r\nand undelayed. Its structure presents variations in different\r\nlatitudes. Near the poles it exhibits the appearance of brushes of\r\nlight, the rays shooting out from the sun towards each summit of\r\nhis axis, while the equatorial rays curve over, presenting a sort\r\nof fish-tail appearance. These variations are modified, as already\r\nmentioned, by some cause which is at all events coincident with the\r\nsun-spot period. At minimum the corona presents itself with polar\r\nbrushes of light and fish-tail equatorial rays, the latter being\r\nsometimes of the most extraordinary length, as in the case of the\r\neclipse of July 29, 1878, when a pair of these wonderful streamers\r\nextended east and west of the eclipsed sun to a distance of at least\r\n10,000,000 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen an eclipse occurs at a spot-maximum, the distribution of the\r\ncoronal features is found to have entirely changed. Instead of being\r\nsharply divided into polar brushes and equatorial wings, the streamers\r\nare distributed fairly evenly around the whole solar margin, in a\r\nmanner suggesting the rays from a star, or a compass-card ornament.\r\nThe existence of this periodic change has been repeatedly confirmed,\r\nand there can be no doubt that the corona reflects in its structure\r\nthe system of variation which prevails upon the sun. 'The form of the\r\ncorona,' says M. Deslandres, 'undergoes periodical variations, which\r\nfollow the simultaneous periodical variations already ascertained for\r\nspots, faculæ, prominences, and terrestrial magnetism.' Certainty\r\nas to its composition has not yet been attained; nor is this to be\r\nwondered at, for the corona is only to be seen in the all too brief\r\nmoments during which a total eclipse is central, and then only over\r\nnarrow tracts of country, and all attempts to secure photographs of\r\nit at other times have hitherto failed. When examined with the\r\nspectroscope, it yields evidence that its light is derived from three\r\nsources--from the incandescence of solid or liquid particles, from\r\nreflected sunshine, and from gaseous emissions. The characteristic\r\nfeature of the coronal spectrum is a bright green line belonging to an\r\nunknown element which has been named 'coronium.'\r\n\r\nThe Chromosphere and the Prominences, unlike the elusive corona,\r\nmay now be studied continuously by means of the spectroscope, and\r\ninstruments are now made at a comparatively moderate price, which, in\r\nconjunction with a small telescope--3 inches will suffice--will enable\r\nthe observer to secure most interesting and instructive views of\r\nboth. The chromosphere is, to use Miss Clerke's expression, 'a solar\r\nenvelope, but not a solar atmosphere.' It surrounds the whole globe of\r\nthe sun to a depth of probably from 3,000 to 4,000 miles, and has\r\nbeen compared to an ocean of fire, but seems rather to present the\r\nappearance of a close bristling covering of flames which rise above\r\nthe surface of the visible sun like the blades of grass upon a lawn.\r\nAny one of these innumerable flames may be elevated into unusual\r\nproportions in obedience to the vast and mysterious forces which\r\nare at work beneath, and then becomes a prominence. On the whole\r\nthe constitution of the chromosphere is the same as that of the\r\nprominences. Professor Young has found that its normal constituents\r\nare hydrogen, helium, coronium, and calcium. But whenever there is any\r\ndisturbance of its surface, the lines which indicate the presence of\r\nthese substances are at once reinforced by numbers of metallic\r\nlines, indicating the presence of iron, sodium, magnesium, and other\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe scale to which these upheavals attain in the prominences is very\r\nremarkable. For example, Young records the observation of a prominence\r\non October 7, 1880. When first seen, at about 10.30 a.m., it was about\r\n40,000 miles in height and attracted no special attention. Half\r\nan hour later it had doubled its height. During the next hour it\r\ncontinued to soar upwards until it reached the enormous altitude of\r\n350,000 miles, and then broke into filaments which gradually faded\r\naway, until by 12.30 there was nothing left of it. On another occasion\r\nhe recorded one which darted upwards in half an hour from a moderate\r\nelevation to a height of 200,000 miles, and in which clouds of\r\nhydrogen must have been hurled aloft with a speed of at least\r\n200 miles per second. (Plate IX. gives a representation of the\r\nchromosphere and prominences from a photograph by M. Deslandres.)\r\nBetween the chromosphere and the actual glowing surface of the sun\r\nwhich we see lies what is known as the 'reversing layer,' from the\r\nfact that owing to its presence the dark lines of the solar spectrum\r\nare reversed in the most beautiful way during the second at the\r\nbeginning and end of totality in an eclipse. Young, who was the first\r\nto observe this phenomenon (December 22, 1870), remarks of it that as\r\nsoon as the sun has been hidden by the advancing moon, 'through the\r\nwhole length of the spectrum, in the red, the green, the violet, the\r\nbright lines flash out by hundreds and thousands, almost startlingly;\r\nas suddenly as stars from a bursting rocket-head, and as evanescent,\r\nfor the whole thing is over within two or three seconds.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nThe Chromosphere and Prominences, April 11, 1894. Photographed by M.\r\nH. Deslandres.]\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of the reversing layer has since been photographed on\r\nseveral occasions--first by Shackleton, at Novaya Zemlya, on August 9,\r\n1896--and its bright lines have been found to be true reversals of the\r\ndark lines of the normal solar spectrum. This layer may be described\r\nas a thin mantle, perhaps 500 miles deep, of glowing metallic vapours,\r\nsurrounding the whole body of the sun, and normally, strange to say,\r\nin a state of profound quiescence. Its presence was of course an\r\nintegral part of Kirchhoff's theory of the mode in which the dark\r\nlines of the solar spectrum were produced. Such a covering was\r\nnecessary to stop the rays whose absence makes the dark lines; and it\r\nwas assumed that the rays so stopped would be seen bright, if only the\r\nsplendour of the solar light could be cut off. These assumptions have\r\ntherefore been verified in the most satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the structure of the sun as now known is very different\r\nfrom the conception of it which would be given by mere naked-eye,\r\nor even telescopic, observation. We have first the visible bright\r\nsurface, or photosphere, with its spots, faculæ, and mottling, and\r\nsurrounded by a kind of atmosphere which absorbs much of its light, as\r\nis evidenced by the fact that the solar limb is much darker than the\r\ncentre of the disc (Plate V.); next the reversing layer, consisting of\r\nan envelope of incandescent vapours, which by their absorption of the\r\nsolar rays corresponding to themselves give rise to the dark lines in\r\nthe spectrum. Beyond these again lies the chromosphere, rising into\r\ngigantic eruptive or cloud-like forms in the prominences; and yet\r\nfurther out the strange enigmatic corona.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the reversing layer, the chromosphere, and\r\nthe corona lie somewhat beyond the bounds and purpose of this volume;\r\nbut without mention of them any account of the sun is hopelessly\r\nincomplete, and it is not at all improbable that a few years may see\r\nthe spectroscope so brought within the reach of ordinary observers as\r\nto enable them in great measure to realize for themselves the facts\r\nconnected with the complex structure of the sun. In any case, the mere\r\nrecital of these facts is fitted to convey to the mind a sense of the\r\nutter inadequacy of our ordinary conceptions of that great body which\r\ngoverns the motions of our earth, and supplies to it and to the other\r\nplanets of our system life and heat, light and guidance. With the\r\nunaided eye we view the sun as a small tranquil white disc; the\r\ntelescope reveals to us that it is a vast globe convulsed by storms\r\nwhich involve the upheaval or submersion, within a few hours, of areas\r\nfar greater than our own world; the spectroscope or the total eclipse\r\nadds to this revelation the further conception of a sweltering ocean\r\nof flame surrounding the whole solar surface, and rising in great\r\njets of fire which would dissolve our whole earth as a drop of wax\r\nis melted in the flame of a candle; while beyond that again the\r\nmysterious corona stretches through unknown millions of miles its\r\nstreamers of silvery light--the great enigma of solar physics. Other\r\nbodies in the universe present us with pictures of beautiful symmetry\r\nand vast size: some even within our own system suggest by their\r\nappearance the presence within their frame of tremendous forces\r\nwhich are still actively moulding them; but the sun gives us the most\r\nstupendous demonstration of living force that the mind of man can\r\napprehend. Of course there are many stars which are known to be suns\r\non which processes similar to those we have been considering are being\r\ncarried on on a yet vaster scale; but the nearness of our sun brings\r\nthe tremendous energy of these processes home to us in a way that\r\nimpresses the mind with a sense almost of fear.\r\n\r\n'Is it possible,' says Professor Newcomb, 'to convey to the mind any\r\nadequate conception of the scale on which natural operations are here\r\ncarried on? If we call the chromosphere an ocean of fire, we must\r\nremember that it is an ocean hotter than the fiercest furnace, and as\r\ndeep as the Atlantic is broad. If we call its movements hurricanes, we\r\nmust remember that our hurricanes blow only about 100 miles an hour,\r\nwhile those of the chromosphere blow as far in a single second. They\r\nare such hurricanes as, coming down upon us from the north, would, in\r\nthirty seconds after they had crossed the St. Lawrence, be in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, carrying with them the whole surface of the continent in\r\na mass not simply of ruin, but of glowing vapour.... When we speak of\r\neruptions, we call to mind Vesuvius burying the surrounding cities in\r\nlava; but the solar eruptions, thrown 50,000 miles high, would engulf\r\nthe whole earth, and dissolve every organized being on its surface in\r\na moment. When the mediæval poets sang, \"Dies iræ, dies illa, solvet\r\nsæclum in favilla,\" they gave rein to their wildest imagination\r\nwithout reaching any conception of the magnitude or fierceness of the\r\nflames around the sun.'\r\n\r\nThe subject of the maintenance of the sun's light and heat is one that\r\nscarcely falls within our scope, and only a few words can be devoted\r\nto it. It is practically impossible for us to attain to any adequate\r\nconception of the enormous amount of both which is continually being\r\nradiated into space. Our own earth intercepts less than the two\r\nthousand millionth part of the solar energy. It has been estimated\r\nthat if a column of ice 2-1/4 miles in diameter could be erected to\r\nspan the huge interval of 92,700,000 miles between the earth and the\r\nsun, and if the sun could concentrate the whole of his heat upon it,\r\nthis gigantic pillar of ice would be dissolved in a single second; in\r\nseven more it would be vaporized. The amount of heat developed on\r\neach square foot of solar surface is 'equivalent to the continuous\r\nevolution of about 10,000 horse-power'; or, as otherwise stated,\r\nis equal to that which would be produced by the hourly burning of\r\nnine-tenths of a ton of anthracite coal on the same area of 1 square\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that mere burning cannot be the source of\r\nsupply. Lord Kelvin has shown that the sun, if composed of solid coal,\r\nwould burn itself out in about 6,000 years.\r\n\r\nAnother source of heat may be sought in the downfall of meteoric\r\nbodies upon the solar surface; and it has been calculated that the\r\ninrush of all the planets of our system would suffice to maintain the\r\npresent energy for 45,604 years. But to suppose the existence near\r\nthe sun of anything like the amount of meteoric matter necessary to\r\naccount, on this theory, for the annual emission of heat involves\r\nconsequences which are quite at variance with observed facts, though\r\nit is possible, or even practically certain, that a small proportion\r\nof the solar energy is derived from this source.\r\n\r\nWe are therefore driven back upon the source afforded by the slow\r\ncontraction of the sun. If this contraction happens, as it must, an\r\nenormous amount of heat must be developed by the process, so much so\r\nthat Helmholtz has shown that an annual contraction of 250 feet would\r\naccount for the total present emission. This contraction is so\r\nslow that about 9,500 years would need to elapse before it became\r\nmeasurable with anything like certainty. In the meantime, then, we may\r\nassume as a working hypothesis that the light and heat of the central\r\nbody of our system are maintained, speaking generally, by his steady\r\ncontraction. Of course this process cannot have gone on, and cannot go\r\non, indefinitely; but as the best authorities have hitherto regarded\r\nthe date when the sun shall have shrunk so far as to be no longer able\r\nto support life on the earth as distant from us by some ten million\r\nyears, and as the latest investigations on the subject, those of Dr.\r\nSee, point in the direction of a very large extension of this limit,\r\nwe may have reasonable comfort in the conviction that the sun will\r\nlast our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMERCURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planet nearest to the sun is not one which has proved itself\r\nparticularly attractive to observers in the past; and the reasons for\r\nits comparative unattractiveness are sufficiently obvious. Owing to\r\nthe narrow limits of his orbit, he never departs further from the sun\r\neither East or West than between 27° and 28°, and the longest period\r\nfor which he can be seen before sunrise or after sunset is two hours.\r\nIt follows that, when seen, he is never very far from the horizon,\r\nand is therefore enveloped in the denser layers of our atmosphere, and\r\npresents the appearance sadly familiar to astronomers under the name\r\nof 'boiling,' the outlines of the planet being tremulous and confused.\r\nOf course, observers who have powerful instruments provided with\r\ngraduated circles can find and follow him during the day, and it is in\r\ndaylight that nearly all the best observations have been secured. But\r\nwith humbler appliances observation is much restricted; and, in fact,\r\nprobably many observers have never seen the planet at all.\r\n\r\nViews of Mercury, however, such as they are, are by no means so\r\ndifficult to secure as is sometimes supposed. Denning remarks that\r\nhe has seen the planet on about sixty-five occasions with the naked\r\neye--that in May, 1876, he saw it on thirteen different evenings, and\r\non ten occasions between April 22 and May 11, 1890; and he states\r\nit as his opinion that anyone who will make it a practice to obtain\r\nnaked-eye views should succeed from about twelve to fifteen times in\r\nthe year. During the spring of 1905, to take a recent example, Mercury\r\nwas quite a conspicuous object for some time in the Western sky, close\r\nto the horizon, and there was no difficulty whatever in obtaining\r\nseveral views of him both with the telescope and with the naked eye,\r\nthough the disc was too much disturbed by atmospheric tremors\r\nfor anything to be made of it telescopically. In his little book,\r\n'Half-hours with the Telescope,' Proctor gives a method of finding the\r\nplanet which would no doubt prove quite satisfactory in practice, but\r\nis somewhat needlessly elaborate. Anyone who takes the pains to\r\nnote those dates when Mercury is most favourably placed for\r\nobservation--dates easily ascertained from Whitaker or any other good\r\nalmanac--and to carefully scan the sky near the horizon after sunset\r\neither with the naked eye, or, better, with a good binocular, will\r\nscarcely fail to detect the little planet which an old English writer\r\nmore graphically than gracefully calls 'a squinting lacquey of the\r\nsun.'\r\n\r\nMercury is about 3,000 miles in diameter, and circles round the sun at\r\na mean distance of 36,000,000 miles. His orbit is very eccentric, so\r\nthat when nearest to the sun this distance is reduced to 28,500,000,\r\nwhile when furthest away from him it rises to 43,500,000. The\r\nproportion of sunlight which falls upon the planet must therefore vary\r\nconsiderably at different points of his orbit. In fact, when he is\r\nnearest to the sun he receives nine times as much light and heat\r\nas would be received by an equal area of the earth; but when the\r\nconditions are reversed, only four times the same amount. The bulk of\r\nthe planet is about one-nineteenth that of the earth, but its weight\r\nis only one-thirtieth, so that its materials are proportionately less\r\ndense than those of our own globe. It is about 3-1/2 times as dense as\r\nwater, the corresponding figure for the earth being rather more than\r\n5-1/2.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is apparent that the materials of which Mercury's globe\r\nis composed reflect light very feebly. It has been calculated that the\r\nplanet reflects only 17 per cent. of the light which falls upon it, 83\r\nper cent. being absorbed; and this fact obviously carries with it the\r\nconclusion that the atmosphere of this little world cannot be of any\r\ngreat density. For clouds in full sunlight are almost as brilliantly\r\nwhite as new-fallen snow, and if Mercury were surrounded with a\r\nheavily cloud-laden atmosphere, he would reflect nearly five times the\r\namount of light which he at present sends out into space.\r\n\r\nAs his orbit falls entirely within that of our own earth, Mercury,\r\nlike his neighbour Venus, exhibits phases. When nearest to us the\r\nplanet is 'new,' when furthest from us it is 'full,' while at the\r\nstages intermediate between these points it presents an aspect like\r\nthat of the moon at its first and third quarters. It may thus be\r\nseen going through the complete series from a thin crescent up to a\r\ncompletely rounded disc. The smallness of its apparent diameter,\r\nand the poor conditions under which it is generally seen, make the\r\nobservation of these phases by no means so easy as in the case of\r\nVenus; yet a small instrument will show them fairly well. Observers\r\nseem generally to agree that the surface has a dull rosy tint, and a\r\nfew faint markings have, by patient observation, been detected upon\r\nit (Fig. 20); but these are far beyond the power of small telescopes.\r\nCareful attention to them and to the rate of their apparent motion\r\nacross the disc has led to the remarkable conclusion that Mercury\r\ntakes as long to rotate upon his axis as he does to complete his\r\nannual revolution in his orbit; in other words, that his day and his\r\nyear are of the same length--namely, eighty-eight of our days. This\r\nconclusion, when announced in 1882 by the well-known Italian observer\r\nSchiaparelli, was received with considerable hesitation. It has,\r\nhowever, been confirmed by many observers, notably by Lowell at\r\nFlagstaff Observatory, Arizona, and is now generally received,\r\nthough some eminent astronomers still maintain that really nothing is\r\ncertainly known as to the period of rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--MERCURY AS A MORNING STAR. W. F. DENNING,\r\n10-INCH REFLECTOR.]\r\n\r\nIf the long period be accepted, it follows that Mercury must always\r\nturn the same face to the sun--that one of his hemispheres must always\r\nbe scorching under intense heat, and the other held in the grasp of an\r\nunrelenting cold of which we can have no conception. 'The effects of\r\nthese arrangements upon climate,' says Miss Agnes Clerke, 'must be\r\nexceedingly peculiar.... Except in a few favoured localities, the\r\nexistence of liquid water must be impossible in either hemisphere.\r\nMercurian oceans, could they ever have been formed, should long ago\r\nhave been boiled off from the hot side, and condensed in \"thick-ribbed\r\nice\" on the cold side.'\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be apparent that Mercury is scarcely\r\nso interesting a telescopic object as some of the other planets. Small\r\ninstruments are practically ruled out of the field by the diminutive\r\nsize of the disc which has to be dealt with, and the average\r\nobserver is apt to be somewhat lacking in the patience without which\r\nsatisfactory observations of an object so elusive cannot be secured.\r\nAt the same time there is a certain amount of satisfaction and\r\ninterest in the mere detection of the little sparkling dot of light in\r\nthe Western sky after the sun has set, or in the Eastern before it has\r\nrisen; and the revelation of the planet's phase, should the telescope\r\nprove competent to accomplish it, gives better demonstration than any\r\ndiagram can convey of the interior position of this little world. It\r\nis consoling to think that even great telescopes have made very little\r\nindeed of the surface of Mercury. Schiaparelli detected a number\r\nof brownish stripes and streaks, which seemed to him sufficiently\r\npermanent to be made the groundwork of a chart, and Lowell has made\r\na remarkable series of observations which reveal a globe seamed and\r\nscarred with long narrow markings; but many observers question the\r\nreality of these features altogether.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps just within the range of possibility that, even with\r\na small instrument, there may be detected that blunting of the South\r\nhorn of the crescent planet which has been noticed by several reliable\r\nobservers. But caution should be exercised in concluding that such a\r\nphenomenon has been seen, or that, if seen, it has been more than\r\nan optical illusion. Those who have viewed Mercury under ordinary\r\nconditions of observation will be well aware how extremely difficult\r\nit is to affirm positively that any markings on the surface or any\r\ndeformations of the outline of the disc are real and actual facts, and\r\nnot due to the atmospheric tremors which affect the little image.\r\n\r\nInteresting, though of somewhat rare occurrence, are the transits of\r\nMercury, when the planet comes between us and the sun, and passes as a\r\nblack circular dot across the bright solar surface. The first occasion\r\non which such a phenomenon was observed was November 7, 1631. The\r\noccurrence of this transit was predicted by Kepler four years in\r\nadvance; and the transit itself was duly observed by Gassendi, though\r\nfive hours later than Kepler's predicted time. It gives some idea\r\nof the uncertainty which attended astronomical calculations in those\r\nearly days to learn that Gassendi considered it necessary to begin\r\nhis observations two days in advance of the time fixed by Kepler.\r\nIf, however, the time of a transit can now be predicted with almost\r\nabsolute accuracy, it need not be forgotten that this result is\r\nlargely due to the labours of men who, like Kepler, by patient effort\r\nand with most imperfect means, laid the foundations of the most\r\naccurate of all sciences.\r\n\r\nThe next transit of Mercury available for observation will take place\r\non November 14, 1907. It may be noted that during transits certain\r\ncurious appearances have been observed. The planet, for example,\r\ninstead of appearing as a black circular dot, has been seen surrounded\r\nwith a luminous halo, and marked by a bright spot upon its dark\r\nsurface. No satisfactory explanation of these appearances has been\r\noffered, and they are now regarded as being of the nature of optical\r\nillusions, caused by defects in the instruments employed, or by\r\nfatigue of the eye. It might, however, be worth the while of any who\r\nhave the opportunity of observing the transit of 1907 to take notice\r\nwhether these features do or do not present themselves. For their\r\nconvenience it may be noted that the transit will begin about eleven\r\no'clock on the forenoon of November 14, and end about 12.45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nVENUS\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in order to Mercury, proceeding outwards from the sun, comes the\r\nplanet Venus, the twin-sister, so to speak, of the earth, and familiar\r\nmore or less to everybody as the Morning and Evening Star. The\r\ndiameter of Venus, according to Barnard's measures with the 36-inch\r\ntelescope of the Lick Observatory, is 7,826 miles; she is therefore\r\na little smaller than our own world. Her distance from the sun is a\r\ntrifle more than 67,000,000 miles, and her orbit, in strong contrast\r\nwith that of Mercury, departs very slightly from the circular. Her\r\ndensity is a little less than that of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that, to the unaided eye, Venus is by far the most\r\nbeautiful of all the planets, and that none of the fixed stars can\r\nfor a moment vie with her in brilliancy. In this respect she is\r\nhandicapped by her position as an inferior planet, for she never\r\ntravels further away from the sun than 48°, and, even under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, cannot be seen for much more than four hours\r\nafter sunset. Thus we never have the opportunity of seeing her, as\r\nMars and Jupiter can be seen, high in the South at midnight, and far\r\nabove the mists of the horizon. Were it possible to see her under such\r\nconditions, she would indeed be a most glorious object. Even as it\r\nis, with all the disadvantages of a comparatively low position and a\r\ndenser stratum of atmosphere, her brilliancy is extremely striking,\r\nhaving been estimated, when at its greatest, at about nine times that\r\nof Sirius, which is the brightest of all the fixed stars, and five\r\ntimes that of Jupiter when the giant planet is seen to the best\r\nadvantage. It is, in fact, so great that, when approaching its\r\nmaximum, the shadows cast by the planet's light are readily seen, more\r\nespecially if the object casting the shadow have a sharply defined\r\nedge, and the shadow be received upon a white surface--of snow, for\r\ninstance. This extreme brilliance points to the fact that the surface\r\nof Venus reflects a very large proportion of the sunlight which falls\r\nupon it--a proportion estimated as being at least 65 per cent., or\r\nnot very much less than that reflected by newly fallen snow. Such\r\nreflective power at once suggests an atmosphere very dense and heavily\r\ncloud-laden; and other observations point in the same direction.\r\nSo that in the very first two planets of the system we are at once\r\nconfronted with that diversity in details which coexists throughout\r\nwith a broad general likeness as to figure, shape of orbit, and other\r\nmatters. Mercury's reflective power is very small, that of Venus is\r\nexceedingly great; Mercury's atmosphere seems to be very attenuated,\r\nthat of Venus, to all appearance, is much denser than that of our own\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nPeriodically, when Venus appears in all her splendour in the Western\r\nsky, one meets with the suggestion that we are having a re-appearance\r\nof the Star of Bethlehem; and it seems to be a perpetual puzzle to\r\nsome people to understand how the same body can be both the Morning\r\nand the Evening Star. Those who have paid even the smallest attention\r\nto the starry heavens are not, however, in the least likely to make\r\nany mistake about the sparkling silver radiance of Venus; and it\r\nwould seem as though the smallest application of common-sense to the\r\nquestion of the apparent motion of a body travelling round an almost\r\ncircular orbit which is viewed practically edgewise would solve for\r\never the question of the planet's alternate appearance on either side\r\nof the sun. Such an orbit must appear practically as a straight line,\r\nwith the sun at its middle point, and along this line the planet will\r\nappear to travel like a bead on a wire, appearing now on one side of\r\nthe sun, now on another. If the reader will draw for himself a diagram\r\nof a circle (sufficiently accurate in the circumstances), with the\r\nsun in the centre, and divide it into two halves by a line supposed to\r\npass from his eye through the sun, he will see at once that when this\r\ncircle is viewed edgewise, and so becomes a straight line, a planet\r\ntravelling round it is bound to appear to move back and forward along\r\none half of it, and then to repeat the same movement along the other\r\nhalf, passing the sun in the process.\r\n\r\nLike Mercury, and for the same reason of a position interior to our\r\norbit, Venus exhibits phases to us, appearing as a fully illuminated\r\ndisc when she is furthest from the earth, as a half-moon at the\r\ntwo intermediate points of her orbit, and as a new moon when she is\r\nnearest to us. The actual proof of the existence of these phases was\r\none of the first-fruits which Galileo gathered by means of his\r\nnewly invented telescope. It is said that Copernicus predicted their\r\ndiscovery, and they certainly formed one of the conclusive proofs\r\nof the correctness of his theory of the celestial system. It was the\r\nsomewhat childish custom of the day for men of science to put forth\r\nthe statement of their discoveries in the form of an anagram, over\r\nwhich their fellow-workers might rack their brains; probably this was\r\ndone somewhat for the same reason which nowadays makes an inventor\r\ntake out a patent, lest someone should rob the discoverer of the\r\ncredit of his discovery before he might find it convenient to make\r\nit definitely public. Galileo's anagram, somewhat more poetically\r\nconceived than the barbarous alphabetic jumble in which Huygens\r\nannounced his discovery of the nature of Saturn's ring, read as\r\nfollows: 'Hæc immatura a me jam frustra leguntur o. y.' This,\r\nwhen transposed into its proper order, conveyed in poetic form the\r\nsubstance of the discovery: 'Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur Mater Amorum'\r\n(The Mother of the Loves [Venus] imitates the phases of Cynthia). It\r\nis true that two letters hang over the end of the original sentence,\r\nbut too much is not to be expected of an anagram.\r\n\r\nAs a telescopic object, Venus is apt to be a little disappointing. Not\r\nthat her main features are difficult to see, or are not beautiful. A\r\n2-inch telescope will reveal her phases with the greatest ease, and\r\nthere are few more exquisite sights than that presented by the silvery\r\ncrescent as she approaches inferior conjunction. It is a picture which\r\nin its way is quite unique, and always attractive even to the most\r\nhardened telescopist.\r\n\r\nStill, what the observer wants is not merely confirmation of the\r\nstatement that Venus exhibits phases. The physical features of a\r\nplanet are always the most interesting, and here Venus disappoints.\r\nThat very brilliant lustre which makes her so beautiful an object to\r\nthe naked eye, and which is even so exquisite in the telescopic view,\r\nis a bar to any great progress in the detection of the planet's actual\r\nfeatures. For it means that what we are seeing is not really the\r\nsurface of Venus, but only the sunward side of a dense atmosphere--the\r\n'silver lining' of heavy clouds which interpose between us and the\r\ntrue surface of the planet, and render it highly improbable that\r\nanything like satisfactory knowledge of her features will ever be\r\nattained. Newcomb, indeed, roundly asserts that all markings hitherto\r\nseen have been only temporary clouds and not genuine surface markings\r\nat all; though this seems a somewhat absolute verdict in view of the\r\nnumber of skilled observers who have specially studied the planet and\r\nassert the objective reality of the markings they have detected. The\r\nblunting of the South horn of the planet, visible in Mr. MacEwen's\r\nfine drawing (Plate X.), is a feature which has been noted by so many\r\nobservers that its reality must be conceded. On the other hand, some\r\nof the earlier observations recording considerable irregularities of\r\nthe terminator (margin of the planet between light and darkness), and\r\ndetached points of light at one of the horns, must seemingly be given\r\nup. Denning, one of the most careful of observers, gives the following\r\nopinion: 'There is strong negative evidence among modern observations\r\nas to the existence of abnormal features, so that the presence of\r\nvery elevated mountains must be regarded as extremely doubtful....\r\nThe detached point at the South horn shown in Schröter's telescope\r\nwas probably a false appearance due to atmospheric disturbances or\r\ninstrumental defects.' It will be seen, therefore, that the observer\r\nshould be very cautious in inferring the actual existence of any\r\nabnormal features which may be shown by a small telescope; and\r\nthe more remarkable the features shown, the more sceptical he may\r\nreasonably be as to their reality. The chances are somewhat heavily\r\nin favour of their disappearance under more favourable conditions of\r\nseeing.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations (2):\r\n\r\n  PLATE X.\r\n\r\nVenus. H. MacEwen. 5-inch Refractor.]\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies, with some modifications, to the dark markings\r\nwhich have been detected on the planet by all sorts of observers\r\nwith all sorts of telescopes. There is no doubt that faint grey\r\nmarkings, such as those shown in Plate X., are to be seen; the\r\nobservations of many skilled observers put this beyond all question.\r\nEven Denning, who says that personally he has sometimes regarded the\r\nvery existence of these markings as doubtful, admits that 'the evidence\r\naffirming their reality is too weighty and too numerously attested to\r\nallow them to be set aside'; and Barnard, observing with the Lick\r\ntelescope, says that he has repeatedly seen markings, but always so\r\n'vague and ill-defined that nothing definite could be made of them.'\r\n\r\nThe observations of Lowell and Douglass at Flagstaff, Arizona, record\r\nquite a different class of markings, consisting of straight, dark,\r\nwell-defined lines; as yet, however, confirmation of these remarkable\r\nfeatures is scanty, and it will be well for the beginner who, with a\r\nsmall telescope and in ordinary conditions of observing, imagines he\r\nhas detected such markings to be rather more than less doubtful about\r\ntheir reality. The faint grey areas, which are real features, at least\r\nof the atmospheric envelope, if not of the actual surface, are\r\nbeyond the reach of small instruments. Mr. MacEwen's drawings, which\r\naccompany this chapter, were made with a 5-inch Wray refractor, and\r\nrepresent very well the extreme delicacy of these markings. I have\r\nsuspected their existence when observing with an 8-1/2-inch With\r\nreflector in good air, but could never satisfy myself that they were\r\nreally seen.\r\n\r\nUp till the year 1890 the rotation period of Venus was usually stated\r\nat twenty-three hours twenty-one minutes, or thereby, though this\r\nfigure was only accepted with some hesitation, as in order to\r\narrive at it there had to be some gentle squeezing of inconvenient\r\nobservations. But in that year Schiaparelli announced that his\r\nobservations were only consistent with a long period of rotation,\r\nwhich could not be less than six months, and was not greater\r\nthan nine. The announcement naturally excited much discussion.\r\nSchiaparelli's views were strongly controverted, and for a time the\r\nastronomical world seemed to be almost equally divided in opinion.\r\nGradually, however, the conclusion has come to be more and more\r\naccepted that Venus, like Mercury, rotates upon her axis in the same\r\ntime as she takes to make her journey round the sun--in other words,\r\nthat her day and her year are of the same length, amounting to about\r\n225 of our days. In 1900 the controversy was to some extent reopened\r\nby the statement of the Russian astronomer Bélopolsky that his\r\nspectroscopic investigations pointed to a much more rapid rotation--to\r\na period, indeed, considerably shorter than twenty-four hours. It\r\nis difficult, however, to reconcile this with the absence of polar\r\nflattening in the globe of Venus. Lowell's spectroscopic observations\r\nare stated by him to point to a period in accordance with his\r\ntelescopic results--namely, 225 days. The matter can scarcely be\r\nregarded as settled in the meantime, but the balance of evidence seems\r\nin favour of the longer period.\r\n\r\nAnother curious and unexplained feature in connection with the planet\r\nis what is frequently termed the 'phosphorescence' of the dark side.\r\nThis is an appearance precisely similar to that seen in the case of\r\nthe moon, and known as 'the old moon in the young moon's arms.' The\r\nrest of the disc appears within the bright crescent, shining with a\r\ndull rusty light. In the case of Venus, however, an explanation is\r\nnot so easily arrived at as in that of the moon, where, of course,\r\nearth-light accounts for the visibility of the dark portion. Had the\r\nplanet been possessed of a satellite, the explanation might have lain\r\nthere; but Venus has no moon, and therefore no moonlight to brighten\r\nher unilluminated portion; and our world is too far distant for\r\nearth-shine to afford an explanation. It has been suggested that\r\nelectrical discharges similar to the aurora may be at the bottom of\r\nthe mystery; but this seems a little far-fetched, as does also the\r\nattribution of the phenomenon to real phosphorescence of the oceans\r\nof Venus. Professor Newcomb cuts the Gordian knot by observing: 'It\r\nis more likely due to an optical illusion.... To whatever we might\r\nattribute the light, it ought to be seen far better after the end of\r\ntwilight in the evening than during the daytime. The fact that it is\r\nnot seen then seems to be conclusive against its reality.' But the\r\nappearance cannot be disposed of quite so easily as this, for it is\r\nnot accurate to say that it is only seen in the daytime, and against\r\nProfessor Newcomb's dictum may be set the judgment of the great\r\nmajority of the observers who have made a special study of the planet.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, safely assign to the limbo of exploded ideas that of\r\nthe existence of a satellite of Venus. For long this object was one\r\nof the most persistent of astronomical ghosts, and refused to be\r\nlaid. Observations of a companion to the planet, much smaller, and\r\nexhibiting a similar phase, were frequent during the eighteenth\r\ncentury; but no such object has presented itself to the far finer\r\ninstruments of modern times, and it may be concluded that the moon of\r\nVenus has no real existence.\r\n\r\nVenus, like Mercury, transits the sun's disc, but at much longer\r\nintervals which render her transits among the rarest of astronomical\r\nevents. Formerly they were also among the most important, as they were\r\nbelieved to furnish the most reliable means for determining the sun's\r\ndistance; and most of the estimates of that quantity, up to within the\r\nlast twenty-five years, were based on transit of Venus observations.\r\nNow, however, other methods, more reliable and more readily\r\napplicable, are coming into use, and the transit has lost somewhat of\r\nits former importance. The interest and beauty of the spectacle still\r\nremain; but it is a spectacle not likely to be seen by any reader of\r\nthese pages, for the next transit of Venus will not take place until\r\nJune, 2004.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, Venus presents few opportunities for useful\r\nobservation to the amateur. The best time for observing, as in\r\nthe case of Mercury, is in broad daylight; and for this, unless in\r\nexceptional circumstances, graduated circles and a fairly powerful\r\ntelescope are required. Practically the most that can be done by the\r\npossessor of a small instrument is to convince himself of the reality\r\nof the phases, and of the non-existence of a satellite of any size,\r\nand to enjoy the exquisite and varying beauty of the spectacle\r\nwhich the planet presents. Should his telescope be one of the small\r\ninstruments which show hard and definite markings on the surface,\r\nhe may also consider that he has learned a useful lesson as to the\r\npossibility of optical illusion, and, incidentally, that he may be\r\nwell advised to procure a better glass when the opportunity of doing\r\nso presents itself. The 'phosphorescence' of the dark side may be\r\nlooked for, and it may be noted whether it is not seen after dark,\r\nor whether it persists and grows stronger. Generally speaking,\r\nobservations should be made as early in the evening as the planet can\r\nbe seen in order that the light of the sky may diminish as much as\r\npossible the glare which is so evident when Venus is viewed against a\r\ndark background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nOur attention is next engaged by the body which is our nearest\r\nneighbour in space and our most faithful attendant and useful servant.\r\nThe moon is an orb of 2,163 miles in diameter, which revolves round\r\nour earth in a slightly elliptical orbit, at a mean distance of about\r\n240,000 miles. The face which she turns to us is a trifle greater\r\nin area than the Russian Empire, while her total surface is almost\r\nexactly equal to the areas of North and South America, islands\r\nexcluded. Her volume is about 2/99 of that of the earth; her materials\r\nare, however, much less dense than those of which our world is\r\ncomposed, so that it would take about eighty-one moons to balance the\r\nearth. One result of these relations is that the force of gravity at\r\nthe lunar surface is only about one-sixth of that at the surface of\r\nthe earth, so that a twelve-stone man, if transported to the moon,\r\nwould weigh only two stone, and would be capable of gigantic feats\r\nin the way of leaping and lifting weights. The fact of the diminished\r\nforce of gravity is of importance in the consideration of the question\r\nof lunar surfacing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--THE TIDES.\r\n\r\nA, Spring Tide (New Moon); B, Neap Tide.]\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous service which our satellite performs for us is\r\nthat of raising the tides. The complete statement of the manner in\r\nwhich she does this would be too long for our pages; but the general\r\noutline of it will be seen from the accompanying rough diagram (Fig.\r\n21), which, it must be remembered, makes no attempt at representing\r\nthe scale either of the bodies concerned or of their distances from\r\none another, but simply pictures their relations to one another at the\r\ntimes of spring and neap tides. The moon (M in Fig. 21, A) attracts\r\nthe whole earth towards it. Its attraction is greatest at the point\r\nnearest to it, and therefore the water on the moonward side is drawn\r\nup, as it were, into a heap, making high tide on that side of the\r\nearth. But there is also high tide at the opposite side, the reason\r\nbeing that the solid body of the earth, which is nearer to the moon\r\nthan the water on the further side, is more strongly attracted, and\r\nso leaves the water behind it. Thus there are high tides at the two\r\nopposite sides of the earth which lie in a straight line with the\r\nmoon, and corresponding low tides at the intermediate positions. Tides\r\nare also produced by the attraction of the sun, but his vastly greater\r\ndistance causes his tide-producing power to be much less than that of\r\nthe moon. His influence is seen in the difference between spring and\r\nneap tides. Spring tides occur at new or full moon (Fig. 21, A, case\r\nof new moon). At these two periods the sun, moon, and earth, are all\r\nin one straight line, and the pull of the sun is therefore added to\r\nthat of the moon to produce a spring tide. At the first and third\r\nquarters the sun and moon are at right angles to one another; their\r\nrespective pulls therefore, to some extent, neutralize each other, and\r\nin consequence we have neap tide at these seasons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nThe Moon, April 5, 1900. Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\nNo one can fail to notice the beautiful set of phases through which\r\nthe moon passes every month. A little after the almanac has announced\r\n'new moon,' she begins to appear as a thin crescent low down in the\r\nWest, and setting shortly after the sun. Night by night we can watch\r\nher moving eastward among the stars, and showing more and more of\r\nher illuminated surface, until at first quarter half of her disc is\r\nbright. The reader must distinguish this real eastward movement from\r\nthe apparent east to west movement due to the daily rotation of the\r\nearth. Its reality can readily be seen by noting the position of the\r\nmoon relatively to any bright star. It will be observed that if she\r\nis a little west of the star on one night, she will have moved to a\r\nposition a little east of it by the next. Still moving farther East,\r\nshe reaches full, and is opposite to the sun, rising when he sets, and\r\nsetting when he rises. After full, her light begins to wane, till at\r\nthird quarter the opposite half of her disc is bright, and she is seen\r\nhigh in the heavens in the early morning, a pale ghost of her evening\r\nglories. Gradually she draws nearer to the sun, thinning down to the\r\ncrescent shape again until she is lost once more in his radiance, only\r\nto re-emerge and begin again the same cycle of change.\r\n\r\nThe time which the moon actually takes to complete her journey round\r\nthe earth is twenty-seven days, seven hours, and forty-three minutes;\r\nand if the earth were fixed in space, this period, which is called the\r\n_sidereal month_, would be the actual time from new moon to new moon.\r\nWhile the moon has been making her revolution, however, the earth has\r\nalso been moving onwards in its journey round the sun, so that the\r\nmoon has a little further to travel in order to reach the 'new\r\nmoon' position again, and the time between two new moons amounts to\r\ntwenty-nine days, twelve hours, forty-four minutes. This period\r\nis called a _lunar month_, and is also the _synodic period_ of our\r\nsatellite, a term which signifies generally the period occupied by any\r\nplanet or satellite in getting back to the same position with respect\r\nto the sun, as observed from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the moon shows phases signifies that she shines only\r\nby reflected light; and it is surprising to notice how little of the\r\nlight that falls upon her is really reflected by her. On an ordinarily\r\nclear night most people would probably say that the moon is much\r\nbrighter than any terrestrial object viewed in the daytime, when it\r\nalso is lit by the sun, as the moon is. Yet a very simple comparison\r\nwill show that this is not so. If the moon be compared during the\r\ndaytime with the clouds floating around her, she will be seen to be\r\ncertainly not brighter than they, generally much less bright; indeed,\r\neven an ordinary surface of sandstone will look as bright as her\r\ndisc. In fact, the reason of her great apparent brightness at night is\r\nmerely the contrast between her and the dark background against which\r\nshe is seen; a fragment of our own world, put in her place, would\r\nshine quite as brightly, perhaps even more so. It is possibly rather\r\ndifficult at first to realize that our earth is shining to the moon\r\nand to the other planets as they do to us, but anyone who watches the\r\nmoon for a few days after new will find convincing evidence of the\r\nfact. Within the arms of the thin crescent can be seen the whole body\r\nof the lunar globe, shining with a dingy coppery kind of light--'the\r\nashen light,' as it is called. People talk of this as 'the old moon\r\nin the young moon's arms,' and weather-wise (or foolish) individuals\r\npronounce it to be a sign of bad weather. It is, of course, nothing\r\nof the sort, for it can be seen every month when the sky is reasonably\r\nclear; but it is the sign that our world shines to the other worlds of\r\nspace as they do to her; for this dim light upon the part of the moon\r\nunlit by the sun is simply the light which our own world reflects from\r\nher surface to the moon. In amount it is thirteen times more than that\r\nwhich the moon gives to us, as the earth presents to her satellite a\r\ndisc thirteen times as large as that exhibited by the latter.\r\n\r\nThe moon's function in causing eclipses of the sun has already been\r\nbriefly alluded to. In turn she is herself eclipsed, by passing behind\r\nthe earth and into the long cone of shadow which our world casts\r\nbehind it into space (Fig. 19). It is obvious that such eclipses can\r\nonly happen when the moon is full. A total eclipse of the moon, though\r\nby no means so important as a solar eclipse, is yet a very interesting\r\nand beautiful sight. The faint shadow or penumbra is often scarcely\r\nperceptible as the moon passes through it; but the passage of the dark\r\numbra over the various lunar formations can be readily traced, and\r\nis most impressive. Cases of 'black eclipses' have been sometimes\r\nrecorded, in which the moon at totality has seemed actually to\r\ndisappear as though blotted out of the heavens; but in general this\r\nis not the case. The lunar disc still remains visible, shining with\r\na dull coppery light, something like the ashen light, but of a\r\nredder tone. This is due to the fact that our earth is not, like\r\nits satellite, a next to airless globe, but is possessed of a pretty\r\nextensive atmosphere. By this atmosphere those rays of the sun which\r\nwould otherwise have just passed the edge of the world are caught\r\nand refracted so that they are directed upon the face of the eclipsed\r\nmoon, lighting it up feebly. The redness of the light is due to that\r\nsame atmospheric absorption of the green and blue rays which causes\r\nthe body of the setting sun to seem red when viewed through the dense\r\nlayer of vapours near the horizon. When the moon appears totally\r\neclipsed to us, the sun must appear totally eclipsed to an observer\r\nstationed on the moon. A total solar eclipse seen from the moon must\r\npresent features of interest differing to some extent from those which\r\nthe similar phenomenon exhibits to us. The duration of totality will\r\nbe much longer, and, in addition to the usual display of prominences\r\nand corona, there will be the strange and weird effect of the black\r\nglobe of our world becoming gradually bordered with a rim of ruddy\r\nlight as our atmosphere catches and bends the solar rays inwards upon\r\nthe lunar surface.\r\n\r\nIn nine cases out of ten the moon will be the first object to which\r\nthe beginner turns his telescope, and he will find in our satellite\r\na never-failing source of interest, and a sphere in which, by patient\r\nobservation and the practice of steadily recording what is seen, he\r\nmay not only amuse and instruct himself, but actually do work that\r\nmay become genuinely useful in the furtherance of the science. The\r\npossession of powerful instrumental means is not an absolute essential\r\nhere, for the comparative nearness of the object brings it well within\r\nthe reach of moderate glasses. The writer well remembers the keen\r\nfeeling of delight with which he first discovered that a very humble\r\nand commonplace telescope--nothing more, in fact, than a small\r\nordinary spy-glass with an object-glass of about 1 inch in\r\naperture--was able to reveal many of the more prominent features of\r\nlunar scenery; and the possessor of any telescope, no matter whether\r\nits powers be great or small, may be assured that there is enough work\r\nawaiting him on the moon to occupy the spare time of many years with\r\none of the most enthralling of studies. The view that is given by even\r\nthe smallest instrument is one of infinite variety and beauty; and its\r\ninterest is accentuated by the fact that the moon is a sphere where\r\npractically every detail is new and strange.\r\n\r\nIf the moon be crescent, or near one or other of her quarters at the\r\ntime of observation, the eye will at once be caught by a multitude\r\nof circular, or nearly circular depressions, more clearly marked the\r\nnearer they are to the line of division between the illuminated\r\nand unilluminated portions of the disc. (This line is known as the\r\nTerminator, the circular outline, fully illuminated, being called the\r\nLimb). The margins of some of these depressions will be seen actually\r\nto project like rings of light into the darkness, while their\r\ninteriors are filled with black shadow (Plates XI., XIII., XV., and\r\nXVI.). At one or two points long bright ridges will be seen, extending\r\nfor many miles across the surface, and marking the line of one or\r\nother of the prominent ranges of lunar mountains (Plates XI., XIII.,\r\nXVI., XVII.); while the whole disc is mottled over with patches of\r\nvaried colour, ranging from dark grey up to a brilliant yellow which,\r\nin some instances, nearly approaches to white.\r\n\r\nIf observation be conducted at or near the full, the conditions will\r\nbe found to have entirely changed. There are now very few ruggednesses\r\nvisible on the edge of the disc, which now presents an almost smooth\r\ncircular outline, nor are there any shadows traceable on the surface.\r\nThe circular depressions, formerly so conspicuous, have now almost\r\nentirely vanished, though the positions and outlines of a few of them\r\nmay still be traced by their contrast in colour with the surrounding\r\nregions. The observer's attention is now claimed by the extraordinary\r\nbrilliance and variety of the tones which diversify the sphere, and\r\nparticularly by the curious systems of bright streaks radiating from\r\ncertain well-marked centres, one of which, the system originating\r\nnear Tycho, a prominent crater not very far from the South Pole, is\r\nso conspicuous as to give the full moon very much the appearance of a\r\nbadly-peeled orange (Plate XII.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nThe Moon, November 13, 1902. Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the moon has passed the full, the ruggedness of its margin\r\nbegins once more to become apparent, but this time on the opposite\r\nside; and the observer, if he have the patience to work late at night\r\nor early in the morning, has the opportunity of seeing again all\r\nthe features which he saw on the waxing moon, but this time with the\r\nshadows thrown the reverse way--under evening instead of under morning\r\nillumination. In fact the character of any formation cannot be truly\r\nappreciated until it has been carefully studied under the setting as\r\nwell as under the rising and meridian sun.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn our attention to the various types of formation which\r\nare to be found upon the moon. These may be roughly summarized as\r\nfollows: (1) The great grey plains, commonly known as Maria, or seas;\r\n(2) the circular or approximately circular formations, known generally\r\nas the lunar craters, but divided by astronomers into a number of\r\nclasses to which reference will be made later; (3) the mountain\r\nranges, corresponding with more or less closeness to similar features\r\non our own globe; (4) the clefts or rills; (5) the systems of bright\r\nrays, to which allusion has already been made.\r\n\r\n1. THE GREAT GREY PLAINS.--These are, of course, the most conspicuous\r\nfeatures of the lunar surface. A number of them can be easily seen\r\nwith the naked eye; and, so viewed, they unite with the brighter\r\nportions to form that resemblance to a human face--'the man in\r\nthe moon'--with which everyone is familiar. A field-glass or small\r\ntelescope brings out their boundaries with distinctness, and suggests\r\na likeness to our own terrestrial oceans and seas. Hence the name\r\nMaria, which was applied to them by the earlier astronomers, whose\r\ntelescopes were not of sufficient power to reveal more than their\r\nbroader outlines. But a comparatively small aperture is sufficient\r\nto dispel the idea that these plains have any right to the title of\r\n'seas.' The smoothness which at first suggests water proves to be only\r\nrelative. They are smooth compared with the brighter regions of the\r\nmoon, which are rugged beyond all terrestrial precedent; but they\r\nwould probably be considered no smoother than the average of our own\r\nnon-mountainous land surfaces. A 2 or 2-1/2-inch telescope will reveal\r\nthe fact that they are dotted over with numerous irregularities, some\r\nof them very considerable. It is indeed not common to find a crater of\r\nthe largest size associated with them; but, at the same time, craters\r\nwhich on our earth would be considered huge are by no means uncommon\r\nupon their surface, and every increase of telescopic power reveals a\r\ncorresponding increase in the number of these objects (Plates XIII.,\r\nXV., XVII.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Moon, September 12, 1903. Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\nFurther, the grey plains are characterized by features of which\r\ninstances may be seen with a very small instrument, though the more\r\ndelicate specimens require considerable power--namely, the long\r\nwinding ridges which either run concentrically with the margins of the\r\nplains, or cross their surface from side to side. Of these the\r\nmost notable is the great serpentine ridge which traverses the Mare\r\nSerenitatis in the north-west quadrant of the moon. As it runs,\r\napproximately, in a north and south direction, it is well placed\r\nfor observation, and even a low power will bring out a good deal of\r\nremarkable detail in connection with it. It rises in some places to a\r\nheight of 700 or 800 feet (Neison), and is well shown on many of the\r\nfine lunar photographs now so common. Another point of interest in\r\nconnection with the Maria is the existence on their borders of a\r\nnumber of large crater formations which present the appearance of\r\nhaving had their walls breached and ruined on the side next the mare\r\nby the action of some obscure agency. From consideration of these\r\nruined craters, and of the 'ghost craters,' not uncommon on the\r\nplains, which present merely a faint outline, as though almost\r\nentirely submerged, it has been suggested, by Elger and others, that\r\nthe Maria, as we see them represent, not the beds of ancient seas,\r\nbut the consolidated crust of some fluid or viscous substance such as\r\nlava, which has welled forth from vents connected with the interior\r\nof the moon, overflowing many of the smaller formations, and partially\r\ndestroying the walls of these larger craters. Notable instances of\r\nthese half-ruined formations will be found in Fracastorius (Plate\r\nXIX., No. 78, and Plate XI.), and Pitatus (Plate XIX., No. 63,\r\nand Plate XV.). The grey plains vary in size from the vast Oceanus\r\nProcellarum, nearly 2,000,000 square miles in area, down to the Mare\r\nHumboldtianum, whose area of 42,000 square miles is less than that of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n2. THE CIRCULAR, OR APPROXIMATELY CIRCULAR FORMATIONS.--These, the\r\ngreat distinguishing feature of lunar scenery, have been classified\r\naccording to the characteristics, more or less marked, which\r\ndistinguish them from one another, as walled-plains, mountain-rings,\r\nring-plains, craters, crater-cones, craterlets, crater-pits, and\r\ndepressions. For general purposes we may content ourselves with the\r\nsingle title craters, using the more specific titles in outstanding\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nRegion of Maginus: Overlapping Craters. Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\nTo these strange formations we have scarcely the faintest analogy\r\non earth. Their multitude will at once strike even the most casual\r\nobserver. Galileo compared them to the 'eyes' in a peacock's tail, and\r\nthe comparison is not inapt, especially when the moon is viewed with\r\na small telescope and low powers. In the Southern Hemisphere\r\nparticularly, they simply swarm to such an extent that the district\r\nnear the terminator presents much the appearance of a honeycomb with\r\nvery irregular cells, or a piece of very porous pumice (Plate XIV.).\r\nTheir vast size is not less remarkable than their number. One of the\r\nmost conspicuous, for example, is the great walled-plain Ptolemäus,\r\nwhich is well-placed for observation near the centre of the visible\r\nhemisphere. It measures 115 miles from side to side of its great\r\nrampart, which, in at least one peak, towers more than 9,000 feet\r\nabove the floor of the plain within. The area of this enormous\r\nenclosure is about equal to the combined areas of Yorkshire,\r\nLancashire, and Westmorland--an extent so vast that an observer\r\nstationed at its centre would see no trace of the mountain-wall which\r\nbounds it, save at one point towards the West, where the upper part of\r\nthe great 9,000-feet peak already referred to would break the line of\r\nthe horizon (Plate XIX., No. 111; Plate XIII.).\r\n\r\nNor is Ptolemäus by any means the largest of these objects. Clavius,\r\nlying towards the South Pole, measures no less than 142 miles from\r\nwall to wall, and includes within its tremendous rampart an area of at\r\nleast 16,000 square miles. The great wall which encloses this space,\r\nitself no mean range of mountains, stands some 12,000 feet above the\r\nsurface of the plain within, while in one peak it rises to a height\r\nof 17,000 feet. Clavius is remarkable also for the number of smaller\r\ncraters associated with it. There are two conspicuous ones, one on the\r\nnorth, one on the south side of its wall, each about twenty-five\r\nmiles in diameter, while the floor is broken by a chain of four large\r\ncraters and a considerable number of smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThough unfavourably placed for observation, there is no lunar feature\r\nwhich can compare in grandeur with Clavius when viewed either at\r\nsunrise or sunset. At sunrise the great plain appears first as a huge\r\nbay of black shadow, so large as distinctly to blunt the southern horn\r\nof the moon to the naked eye. As the sun climbs higher, a few bright\r\npoints appear within this bay of darkness--the summits of the walls of\r\nthe larger craters--these bright islands gradually forming fine rings\r\nof light in the shadow which still covers the floor of the great\r\nplain. In the East some star-like points mark where the peaks of the\r\neastern wall are beginning to catch the dawn. Then delicate streaks\r\nof light begin to stream across the floor, and the dark mass of shadow\r\ndivides itself into long pointed shafts, which stretch across the\r\nplain like the spires of some great cathedral. The whole spectacle\r\nis so magnificent and strange that no words can do justice to it; and\r\nonce seen it will not readily be forgotten. Even a small telescope\r\nwill enable the student to detect and draw the more important features\r\nof this great formation; and for those whose instruments are more\r\npowerful there is practically no limit to the work that may be done\r\non Clavius, which has never been studied with the minuteness that so\r\ngreat and interesting an object deserves. (Clavius is No. 13, Plate\r\nXIX. See also Plates XIII. and XV., and Fig. 22, the latter a rough\r\nsketch with a 2-5/8-inch refractor.)\r\n\r\nFrom such gigantic forms as these, the craters range downwards in an\r\nunbroken sequence through striking objects such as Tycho and the grand\r\nCopernicus, both distinguished for their systems of bright rays, as\r\nwell as for their massive and regular ramparts, to tiny pits of black\r\nshadow, a few hundred feet across, and with no visible walls, which\r\ntax the powers of the very finest instruments. Schmidt's great map\r\nlays down nearly 33,000 craters, and it is quite certain that these\r\nare not nearly all which can be seen even with a moderate-sized\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nClavius, Tycho, and Mare Nubium. Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nAs to the cause which has resulted in this multitude of circular\r\nforms, there is no definite consensus of opinion. Volcanic action is\r\nthe agency generally invoked; but, even allowing for the diminished\r\nforce of gravity upon the moon, it is difficult to conceive of\r\nvolcanic action of such intensity as to have produced some of the\r\ngreat walled-plains. Indeed, Neison remarks that such formations are\r\nmuch more akin to the smaller Maria, and bear but little resemblance\r\nto true products of volcanic action. But it seems difficult to tell\r\nwhere a division is to be made, with any pretence to accuracy, between\r\nsuch forms as might certainly be thus produced and those next above\r\nthem in size. The various classes of formation shade one into the\r\nother by almost imperceptible degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.\r\n\r\nCLAVIUS, June 7, 1889, 10 p.m., 2-5/8 inch.]\r\n\r\n3. THE MOUNTAIN RANGES.--These are comparatively few in number, and\r\nare never of such magnitude as to put them, like the craters, beyond\r\nterrestrial standards of comparison. The most conspicuous range is\r\nthat known as the Lunar Apennines, which runs in a north-west and\r\nsouth-east direction for a distance of upwards of 400 miles along\r\nthe border of the Mare Imbrium, from which its mass rises in a steep\r\nescarpment, towering in one instance (Mount Huygens) to a height of\r\nmore than 18,000 feet. On the western side the range slopes gradually\r\naway in a gentle declivity. The spectacle presented by the Apennines\r\nabout first quarter is one of indescribable grandeur. The shadows of\r\nthe great peaks are cast for many miles over the surface of the Mare\r\nImbrium, magnificently contrasting with the wild tract of hill-country\r\nbehind, in which rugged summits and winding valleys are mingled in a\r\nscene of confusion which baffles all attempt at delineation. Two other\r\nimportant ranges--the Caucasus and the Alps--lie in close proximity\r\nto the Apennines; the latter of the two notable for the curious Alpine\r\nValley which runs through it in a straight line for upwards of eighty\r\nmiles. This wonderful chasm varies in breadth from about two miles,\r\nat its narrowest neck, to about six at its widest point. It is closely\r\nbordered, for a considerable portion of its length, by almost vertical\r\ncliffs thousands of feet in height, and under low magnifying powers\r\nappears so regular as to suggest nothing so much as the mark of\r\na gigantic chisel, driven by main force through the midst of the\r\nmountain mass. The Alpine Valley is an easy object, and a power of\r\n50 on a 2-inch telescope will show its main outlines quite clearly.\r\nIndeed, the whole neighbourhood is one which will well repay the\r\nstudent, some of the finest of the lunar craters, such as Plato,\r\nArchimedes, Autolycus, and Aristillus, lying in the immediate vicinity\r\n(Plates XIII. and XVII.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nRegion of Theophilus and Altai Mountains. Yerkes Observatory.]\r\n\r\nAmong the other mountain-ranges may be mentioned the Altai Mountains,\r\nin the south-west quadrant (Plate XVI.), the Carpathians, close to the\r\ngreat crater Copernicus, and the beautiful semicircle of hills which\r\nborders the Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, to the east of the\r\nAlpine range. This bay forms one of the loveliest of lunar landscapes,\r\nand under certain conditions of illumination its eastern cape, the\r\nHeraclides Promontory, presents a curious resemblance, which I have\r\nonly seen once or twice, to the head of a girl with long floating\r\nhair--'the moon-maiden.' The Leibnitz and Doerfel Mountains, with\r\nother ranges whose summits appear on the edge of the moon, are\r\nseldom to be seen to great advantage, though they are sometimes\r\nvery noticeably projected upon the bright disc of the sun during the\r\nprogress of an eclipse.[*] They embrace some of the loftiest lunar\r\npeaks reaching 26,000 feet in one of or two instances, according to\r\nSchröter and Mädler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.\r\n\r\nARISTARCHUS and HERODOTUS, February 20, 1891, 6.15 p.m., 3-7/8 inch.]\r\n\r\n4. THE CLEFTS OR RILLS.--In these, and in the ray-systems, we again\r\nmeet with features to which a terrestrial parallel is absolutely\r\nlacking. Schröter of Lilienthal was the first observer to detect the\r\nexistence of these strange chasms, and since his time the number known\r\nhas been constantly increasing, till at present it runs to upwards of\r\na thousand. These objects range from comparatively coarse features,\r\nsuch as the Herodotus Valley (Fig. 23), and the well-known Ariadæus\r\nand Hyginus clefts, down to the most delicate threads, only to be seen\r\nunder very favourable conditions, and taxing the powers of the finest\r\ninstruments. They present all the appearance of cracks in a shrinking\r\nsurface, and this is the explanation of their existence which at\r\npresent seems to find most favour. In some cases, such as that of\r\nthe great Sirsalis cleft, they extend to a length of 300 miles; their\r\nbreadth varies from half a mile, or less, to two miles; their depth is\r\nvery variously estimated, Nasmyth putting it at ten miles, while Elger\r\nonly allows 100 to 400 yards. In a number of instances they appear\r\neither to originate from a small crater, or to pass through one or\r\nmore craters in their course. The student will quickly find out for\r\nhimself that they frequently affect the neighbourhood of one or other\r\nof the mountain ranges (as, for example, under the eastern face of the\r\nApennines, Plate XVII.), or of some great crater, such as Archimedes.\r\nThey are also frequently found traversing the floor of a great\r\nwalled-plain, and at least forty have been detected in the interior\r\nof Gassendi (Plate XIX., No. 90). Smaller instruments are, of course,\r\nincompetent to reveal more than a few of the larger and coarser of\r\nthese strange features. The Serpentine Valley of Herodotus, the cleft\r\ncrossing the floor of Petavius, and the Ariadæus and Hyginus rills\r\nare among the most conspicuous, and may all be seen with a 2-1/2-inch\r\ntelescope and a power of 100.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nApennines, Alps, and Caucasus. Paris Observatory.]\r\n\r\n5. THE SYSTEMS OF BRIGHT RAYS, radiating from certain craters, remain\r\nthe most enigmatic of the features of lunar scenery. Many of these\r\nsystems have been traced and mapped, but we need only mention the\r\nthree principal--those connected with Tycho, Copernicus, and\r\nKepler, all shown on Plate XII. The Tycho system is by far the most\r\nnoteworthy, and at once attracts the eye when even the smallest\r\ntelescope is directed towards the full moon. The rays, which are of\r\ngreat brilliancy, appear to start, not exactly from the crater itself,\r\nbut from a greyish area surrounding it, and they radiate in all\r\ndirections over the surface, passing over, and almost completely\r\nmasking in their course some of the largest of the lunar craters.\r\nClavius, for example, and Maginus (Plate XIV.), become at full almost\r\nunidentifiable from this cause, though Neison's statement that 'not\r\nthe slightest trace of these great walled-plains, with their extremely\r\nlofty and massive walls, can be detected in full,' is certainly\r\nexaggerated. The rays are not well seen save under a high sun--_i.e._,\r\nat or near full, though some of them can still be faintly traced under\r\noblique illumination.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary telescopes, and to most eyes, the Tycho rays appear to\r\nrun on uninterruptedly for enormous distances, one of them traversing\r\nalmost the whole breadth of the moon in a north-westerly direction,\r\nand crossing the Mare Serenitatis, on whose dark background it is\r\nconspicuous. Professor W. H. Pickering, who has made a special study\r\nof the subject under very favourable conditions, maintains, however,\r\nthat this appearance of great length is an illusion, and that the\r\nTycho rays proper extend only for a short distance, being reinforced\r\nat intervals by fresh rays issuing from small craters on their track.\r\nThe whole subject is one which requires careful study with the best\r\noptical means.\r\n\r\nNone of the other ray-systems are at all comparable with that of\r\nTycho, though those in connection with Copernicus and Kepler are\r\nvery striking. As to the origin and nature of these strange features,\r\nlittle is known. There are almost as many theories as there are\r\nsystems; but it cannot be said that any particular view has commanded\r\nanything like general acceptance. Nasmyth's well-known theory was\r\nthat they represented cracks in the lunar surface, caused by internal\r\npressure, through which lava had welled forth and spread to a\r\nconsiderable distance on either side of the original chasm. Pickering\r\nsuggests that they may be caused by a deposit of white powder, pumice,\r\nperhaps, emitted by the craters from which the rays originate. Both\r\nideas are ingenious, but both present grave difficulties, and neither\r\nhas commended itself to any very great extent to observers, a remark\r\nwhich applies to all other attempts at explanation.\r\n\r\nSuch are the main objects of interest upon the visible hemisphere of\r\nour satellite. In observing them, the beginner will do well, after the\r\ninevitable preliminary debauch of moon-gazing, during which he may\r\nbe permitted to range over the whole surface and observe anything\r\nand everything, not to attempt an attack on too wide a field. Let\r\nhim rather confine his energies to the detailed study of one or two\r\nparticular formations, and to the delineation of all their features\r\nwithin reach of his instrument under all aspects and illuminations.\r\nBy so doing he will learn more of the actual condition of the lunar\r\nsurface than by any amount of general and haphazard observation; and\r\nmay, indeed, render valuable service to the study of the moon.\r\n\r\nNeither let him think that observations made with a small telescope\r\nare now of no account, in view of the number of large instruments\r\nemployed, and of the great photographic atlases which are at present\r\nbeing constructed. It has to be remembered that the famous map of\r\nBeer and Mädler was the result of observations made with a 3-3/4-inch\r\ntelescope, and that Lohrmann used an instrument of only 4-4/5 inches,\r\nand sometimes one of 3-1/4. Anyone who has seen the maps of these\r\nobservers will not fail to have a profound respect for the work that\r\ncan be done with very moderate means. Nor have even the beautiful\r\nphotographs of the Paris, Lick, and Yerkes Observatories superseded\r\nas yet the work of the human eye and hand. The best of the Yerkes\r\nphotographs, taken with a 40-inch refractor, are said to show detail\r\n'sufficiently minute to tax the powers of a 6-inch telescope.' But\r\nthis can be said only of a very few photographs; and, generally\r\nspeaking, a good 3-inch glass will show more detail than can be seen\r\non any but a few exceptionally good negatives.\r\n\r\nIn conducting his observations, the student should be careful to\r\noutline his drawing on such a scale as will permit of the easy\r\ninclusion of all the details which he can see, otherwise the sketch\r\nwill speedily become so crowded as to be indistinct and valueless. A\r\nscale of 1 inch to about 20 miles, corresponding roughly to 100 inches\r\nto the moon's diameter, will be found none too large in the case of\r\nformations where much detail has to be inserted--that is to say, in\r\nthe case of the vast majority of lunar objects. Further, only such a\r\nmoderate amount of surface should be selected for representation as\r\ncan be carefully and accurately sketched in a period of not much over\r\nan hour at most; for, though the lunar day is so much longer than our\r\nown, yet the changes in aspect of the various formations due to the\r\nincreasing or diminishing height of the sun become very apparent if\r\nobservation be prolonged unduly; and thus different portions of the\r\nsketch represent different angles of illumination, and the finished\r\ndrawing, though true in each separate detail, will be untrue as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nAbove all, care must be taken to set down only what is seen with\r\ncertainty, _and nothing more_. The drawing may be good or bad, but it\r\nmust be true. A coarse or clumsy sketch which is truthful to the\r\nfacts seen is worth fifty beautiful works of art where the artist has\r\nemployed imagination or recollection to eke out the meagre results of\r\nobservation. The astronomer's primary object is to record facts, not\r\nto make pictures. If he is skilful in recording what he sees, his\r\nsketch will be so much the more truthful; but the facts must come\r\nfirst. Such practical falsehoods as the insertion of uncertain\r\ndetails, or the practice of drawing upon one's recollection of the\r\nwork of other observers, or of altering portions of a sketch which\r\ndo not please the eye, are to be studiously avoided. The observer's\r\nrecord of what he has seen should be above suspicion. It may\r\nbe imperfect; it should never be false. Such cautions may seem\r\nsuperfluous, but a small acquaintance with the subject of astronomical\r\ndrawing will show that they are not.\r\n\r\nThe want of a good lunar chart will speedily make itself felt.\r\nFortunately in these days it can be easily supplied. The great\r\nphotographic atlases now appearing are, of course, for the luxurious;\r\nand the elaborate maps of Beer and Mädler or Schmidt are equally\r\nout of the question for beginners. The smaller chart of the former\r\nobservers is, however, inexpensive and good, though a little crowded.\r\nFor a start there is still nothing much better than Webb's reduction\r\nof Beer and Mädler's large chart, published in 'Celestial Objects for\r\nCommon Telescopes.' It can also be obtained separately; but requires\r\nto be backed before use. Mellor's chart is also useful, and is\r\npublished in a handy form, mounted on mill-board. Those who wish\r\ncharts between these and the more elaborate ones will find their\r\nwants met by such books as those of Neison or Elger. Neison's volume\r\ncontains a chart in twenty-two sections on a scale of 2 feet to\r\nthe moon's diameter. It includes a great amount of detail, and\r\nis accompanied by an elaborate description of all the features\r\ndelineated. Its chief drawbacks are the fact that it was published\r\nthirty years ago, and that it is an extremely awkward and clumsy\r\nvolume to handle, especially in the dim light of an observatory.\r\nElger's volume is, perhaps, for English students, the handiest general\r\nguide to the moon. Its chart is on a scale of 18 inches to the moon's\r\ndiameter, and is accompanied by a full description. With either this\r\nor Webb's chart, the beginner will find himself amply provided with\r\nmaterial for many a long and delightful evenings work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nChart of the Moon. Nasmyth and Carpenter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nKey to Chart of Moon. Nasmyth and Carpenter.]\r\n\r\nThe small chart which accompanies this chapter, and which, with its\r\nkey-map, I owe to the courtesy of Mr. John Murray, the publisher of\r\nMessrs. Nasmyth and Carpenter's volume on the moon, is not in any\r\nsense meant as a substitute for those already mentioned, but merely\r\nas an introduction to some of the more prominent features of lunar\r\nscenery. The list of 229 named and numbered formations will be\r\nsufficient to occupy the student for some time; and the essential\r\nparticulars with regard to a few of the more important formations are\r\nadded in as brief a form as possible (Appendix I.).\r\n\r\nBefore we leave our satellite, something must be said as to the\r\nconditions prevailing on her surface. The early astronomers who\r\ndevoted attention to lunar study were drawn on in their labours\r\nlargely by the hope of detecting resemblances to our own earth, or\r\neven traces of human habitation. Schröter and Gruithuisen imagined\r\nthat they had discovered not only indications of a lunar atmosphere,\r\nbut also evidence of change upon the surface, and traces of the\r\nhandiwork of lunarian inhabitants. Gruithuisen, in particular, was\r\nconfident that in due time it would become possible to trace the\r\ncities and the works of the Lunarians. Gradually these hopes have\r\nreceded into the distance. The existence of a lunar atmosphere is,\r\nindeed, no longer positively denied now, as it was a few years ago;\r\nbut it is certain that such atmosphere as may exist is of extreme\r\nrarity, quite inadequate to support animal life as we understand such\r\na thing. Certain delicate changes of colour which take place within\r\nsome of the craters--Plato for instance--have been referred to\r\nvegetation; and Professor Pickering has intimated his observation\r\nof something which he considers to be the forming and melting of\r\nhoar-frost within certain areas, Messier and a small crater near\r\nHerodotus among others. But the observations at best are very delicate\r\nand the inferences uncertain. It cannot be denied that the moon may\r\nhave an atmosphere; but positive traces of its existence are so faint\r\nthat, even if their reality be admitted, very little can be built upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt the same time when the affirmation is made that the moon is 'a\r\nworld where there is no weather, and where nothing ever happens,' the\r\nmost careful modern students of lunar matters would be the first\r\nto question such a statement. Even supposing it to be true that no\r\nconcrete evidence of change upon the lunar surface can be had, this\r\nwould not necessarily mean that no change takes place. The moon has\r\ncertainly never been studied to advantage with any power exceeding\r\n1,000, and the average powers employed have been much less. Nasmyth\r\nputs 300 as about the profitable limit, and 500 would be almost an\r\noutside estimate for anything like regular work. But even assuming the\r\nuse of a power of 1,000, that means that the moon is seen as large as\r\nthough she were only 240 miles distant from us. The reader can judge\r\nhow entirely all but the very largest features of our world would\r\nbe lost to sight at such a distance, and how changes involving the\r\ndestruction of large areas might take place and the observer be none\r\nthe wiser. When it is remembered that even at this long range we are\r\nviewing our object through a sea of troubled air of which every tremor\r\nis magnified in proportion to the telescopic power employed, until the\r\nfiner details are necessarily blurred and indistinct, it will be seen\r\nthat the case has been understated. Indeed it may be questioned if the\r\nmoon has ever been as well seen as though it had been situated at a\r\ndistance of 500 miles from the earth. At such a distance nothing short\r\nof the vastest cataclysms would be visible; and it is therefore going\r\nquite beyond the mark to assume that nothing ever happens on the moon\r\nsimply because we do not see it happening. Moreover, the balance of\r\nevidence does appear to be inclining, slightly perhaps, but still\r\nalmost unquestionably, towards the view that change does occur upon\r\nthe moon. Some of the observations which seem to imply change may\r\nbe explained on other grounds; but there is a certain residuum which\r\nappears to defy explanation, and it is very noteworthy that while\r\nthose who at once dismiss the idea of lunar change are, generally\r\nspeaking, those who have made no special study of the moon's surface,\r\nthe contrary opinion is most strongly maintained by eminent observers\r\nwho have devoted much time to our satellite with the best modern\r\ninstruments to aid them in their work.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the possibility of change does not, however, imply\r\nanything like fitness for human habitation. The moon, to use Beer\r\nand Mädler's oft-quoted phrase, is 'no copy of the earth'; and the\r\nconditions of her surface differ widely from anything that we are\r\nacquainted with. The extreme rarity of her atmosphere must render her,\r\nwere other conditions equally favourable, an ideal situation for an\r\nobservatory. From her surface the stars, which are hidden from us\r\nin the daytime by the diffused light in our air, would be visible at\r\nbroad noonday; while multitudes of the smaller magnitudes which here\r\nrequire telescopic power would there be plain to the unaided eye. The\r\nlunar night would be lit by our own earth, a gigantic moon, presenting\r\na surface more than thirteen times as large as that which the full\r\nmoon offers us, and hanging almost stationary in the heavens, while\r\nexhibiting all the effects of rapid rotation upon its own axis. Those\r\nappendages of the sun, which only the spectroscope or the fleeting\r\ntotal eclipse can reveal to us, the corona, the chromosphere, and the\r\nprominences, would there be constantly visible.\r\n\r\nOur astronomers who are painfully wrestling with atmospheric\r\ndisturbance, and are gradually being driven from the plains to the\r\nsummits of higher and higher hills in search of suitable sites for\r\nthe giant telescopes of to-day, may well long for a world where\r\natmospheric disturbance must be unknown, or at least a negligible\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: See drawings by Colonel Markwick with 2-3/4-inch\r\nrefractor, of the eclipse of August 30, 1905, 'The Total Solar\r\nEclipse, 1905,' British Astronomical Association, pp. 59, 60.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Planet is our nearest neighbour on the further, as Venus is on\r\nthe hither side. He is also in some ways the planet best situated for\r\nour observation; for while the greatest apparent diameter of his disc\r\nis considerably less than that of Venus, he does not hide close to the\r\nsun's rays like the inferior planets, but may be seen all night\r\nwhen in opposition.[*] Not all oppositions, however, are equally\r\nfavourable. Under the best circumstances he may come as near to us as\r\n35,000,000 miles; when less favourably situated, he may come no nearer\r\nthan 61,000,000. This very considerable variation in his distance\r\narises from the eccentricity of the planet's orbit, which amounts to\r\nnearly one-tenth, and, so far as we are concerned, it means that his\r\ndisc is three times larger when he comes to opposition at his least\r\ndistance from the sun than it is when the conditions are reversed.\r\nUnder the most favourable circumstances--_i.e._, when opposition and\r\nperihelion[†] occur together, he presents, it has been calculated, a\r\ndisc of the same diameter as a half sovereign held up 2,000 yards from\r\nthe spectator. Periods of opposition recur at intervals of about 780\r\ndays, and at the more favourable ones the planet's brilliancy is very\r\nstriking. The 1877 opposition was very notable in this respect, and in\r\nothers connected with the study of Mars, and that which preceded the\r\nCrimean War was also marked by great brilliancy. Readers of Tennyson\r\nwill remember how Maud\r\n\r\n  'Seem'd to divide in a dream from a band of the blest,\r\n  And spoke of a hope for the world in the coming wars--\r\n                              ... and pointed to Mars\r\n  As he glow'd like a ruddy shield on the Lion's breast.'\r\n\r\nAncient records tell us of his brightness having been so great on\r\nsome occasions as to create a panic. Panics were evidently more easily\r\ncreated by celestial phenomena then than they are now; but possibly\r\nsuch statements have to be taken with a small grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Mars is 4,200 miles. In volume he is equal to\r\none-seventh of the world; but his density is somewhat smaller, so that\r\nnine globes such as Mars would be required to balance the earth. He\r\nturns upon his axis in twenty-four hours thirty-seven minutes, and as\r\nthe inclination of the axis is not much different from that of our\r\nown world he will experience seasonal effects somewhat similar to\r\nthe changes of our own seasons. The Martian seasons, however, will be\r\nconsiderably longer than ours, as the year of Mars occupies 687 days,\r\nand they will be further modified by the large variation which\r\nhis distance from the sun undergoes in the course of his year--the\r\ndifference between his greatest and least distances being no less than\r\n26,500,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe telescopic view of Mars at once reveals features of considerable\r\ninterest. We are no longer presented with anything like the beautiful\r\nphases of Venus, though Mars does show a slight phase when his\r\nposition makes a right angle with the sun and the earth. This phase,\r\nhowever, never amounts to more than a dull gibbosity, like that of the\r\nmoon two or three days before or after full--the most uninteresting of\r\nphases. But the other details which are visible much more than atone\r\nfor any deficiency in this respect. The brilliant ruddy star expands\r\nunder telescopic power into a broad disc whose ground tint is a warm\r\nochre. This tint is diversified in two ways. At the poles there are\r\nbrilliant patches of white, larger or smaller according to the Martian\r\nseason; while the whole surface of the remaining orange-tinted portion\r\nis broken up by patches and lines of a dark greenish-grey tone.\r\nThe analogy with Arctic and Antarctic ice and snow-fields, and with\r\nterrestrial continents and seas, is at once and almost irresistibly\r\nsuggested, although, as will be seen, there are strong reasons for not\r\npressing it too far.\r\n\r\nThe dark markings, though by no means so sharply defined as the\r\noutlines of lunar objects, are yet evidently permanent features; at\r\nleast this may be confidently affirmed of the more prominent among\r\nthem. Some of these can be readily recognised on drawings dating from\r\n200 years back, and have served to determine with very satisfactory\r\naccuracy the planet's rotation period. In accordance with the almost\r\nirresistible evidence which the telescope was held to present, these\r\nfeatures were assumed to be seas, straits and bays, while the general\r\nochre-tinted portion of the planet's surface was considered to be dry\r\nland. On this supposition the land area of Mars amounts to 5/7 of the\r\nplanet's surface, water being confined to the remaining 2/7. But it\r\nis by no means to be taken as an accepted fact that the dark and light\r\nareas do represent water and land. One fact most embarrassing to those\r\nwho hold this traditional view is that in the great wealth of detail\r\nwhich observation with the huge telescopes of to-day has accumulated\r\nthe bulk belongs to the dark areas. Gradations of shade are seen\r\nconstantly in them; delicate details are far more commonly to be\r\nobserved upon them than upon the bright portions of the surface, and\r\nseveral of the 'canals' have been traced clear through the so-called\r\nseas. Speaking of his observations of Mars in 1894 with the 36-inch\r\nrefractor of the Lick observatory, Professor Barnard says: 'Though\r\nmuch detail was shown on the bright \"continental\" regions, the\r\ngreater amount was visible on the so-called \"seas.\"... During these\r\nobservations the impression seemed to force itself upon me that I was\r\nactually looking down from a great altitude upon just such a surface\r\nas that in which our observatory was placed. At these times there was\r\nno suggestion that the view was one of far-away seas and oceans, but\r\nexactly the reverse.' Such observations are somewhat disconcerting\r\nto the old belief, which, nevertheless, continues to maintain itself,\r\nthough in somewhat modified form.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed difficult, if not impossible, to explain the observed\r\nfacts with regard, for instance, to the white polar caps, on any other\r\nsupposition than that of the existence of at least a considerable\r\namount of water upon the planet. These caps are observed to be large\r\nafter the Martian winter has passed over each particular hemisphere.\r\nAs the season progresses, the polar cap diminishes, and has even been\r\nseen to melt away altogether. In one of the fine drawings by the Rev.\r\nT. E. R. Phillips, which illustrate this chapter (Plate XX.), the\r\nnorth polar snow will be seen accompanied by a dark circular line,\r\nconcerning which the author of the sketch says: 'The _melting_ cap is\r\nalways girdled by a narrow and intensely dark line. This is not seen\r\nwhen the cap is forming.' It is hard to believe that this is anything\r\nelse than the result of the melting of polar snows, and where there\r\nis melting snow there must be water. Such results as those obtained by\r\nProfessor Pickering by photography point in the same direction. In one\r\nof his photographs the polar cap was shown much shrunken; in another,\r\ntaken a few days later, it had very considerably increased in\r\ndimensions--as one would naturally conclude, from a fall of snow in\r\nthe interval. The quantity of water may not be anything like so\r\ngreat as was at one time imagined; still, to give any evidence of\r\nits presence at all at a distance of 40,000,000 miles it must be very\r\nconsiderable, and must play an important part in the economy of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\nMars: Drawing 1, January 30, 1899--12 hours.

Phillips.]\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Schiaparelli of Milan announced that he had discovered that\r\nthe surface of Mars was covered with a network of lines running with\r\nperfect straightness often for hundreds of miles across the surface,\r\nand invariably connecting two of the dark areas. To these markings\r\nhe gave the name of 'canali,' a word which has been responsible for\r\na good deal of misunderstanding. Translated into our language by\r\n'canals,' it suggested the work of intelligent beings, and imagination\r\nwas allowed to run riot over the idea of a globe peopled by Martians\r\nof superhuman intelligence and vast engineering skill. The title\r\n'canals' is still retained; but it should be noted that the term is\r\nnot meant to imply artificial construction any more than the term\r\n'rill' on the moon implies the presence of water.\r\n\r\nAt the next opposition of Mars, Schiaparelli not only rediscovered his\r\ncanals, but made the astonishing announcement that many of them were\r\ndouble, a second streak running exactly parallel to the first at some\r\ndistance from it. His observations were received with a considerable\r\namount of doubt and hesitation. Skilled observers declared that\r\nthey could see nothing in the heavens the least corresponding to the\r\nnetwork of hard lines which the Italian observer drew across the globe\r\nof Mars; and therein to some extent they were right, for the canals\r\nare not seen with that hardness of definition with which they\r\nare sometimes represented. But, at the same time, each successive\r\nopposition has added fresh proof of the fact that Schiaparelli was\r\nessentially right in his statement of what was seen. The question\r\nof the doubling of the canals is still under dispute, and it seems\r\nprobable that it is not a real objective fact existing upon the\r\nplanet, but is merely an optical effect due to contrast. There can be\r\nno question, however, about the positive reality of a great number\r\nof the canals themselves; their existence is too well attested by\r\nobservers of the highest skill and experience. 'There is really no\r\ndoubt whatever,' says Mr. Denning, 'about the streaked or striated\r\nconfiguration of the Northern hemisphere of Mars. The canals do not\r\nappear as narrow straight deep lines in my telescope, but as soft\r\nstreams of dusky material with frequent condensations.' The drawings\r\nby Mr. Phillips well represent the surface of the planet as seen with\r\nan instrument of considerable power; and the reader will notice that\r\nhis representation of the canals agrees remarkably well with Denning's\r\ndescription. The 'soft streams with frequent condensations' are\r\nparticularly well shown on the drawing of April 22, 1903, which\r\nrepresents the region of 200° longitude (see Chart, Plate XXI.) on\r\nthe centre of the disc. 'The main results of Professor Schiaparelli's\r\nwork,' remarks Mr. Phillips, 'are imperishable and beyond question.\r\nDuring recent years some observers have given to the so-called\r\n\"canals\" a hardness and an artificiality which they do not possess,\r\nwith the result that discredit has been brought upon the whole canal\r\nsystem.... But of the substantial accuracy and truthfulness (as a\r\nbasis on which to work) of the planet's configuration as charted by\r\nthe great Italian in 1877 and subsequent years, there is in my mind no\r\ndoubt.' The question of the reality of the canal system may almost\r\nbe said to have received a definite answer from the remarkable\r\nphotographs of Mars secured in May, 1905, by Mr. Lampland at the\r\nFlagstaff Observatory, which prove that, whatever may be the nature\r\nof the canals, the principal ones at all events are actual features of\r\nthe planet's surface.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been directed within the last few years to the\r\nobservations of Lowell, made with a fine 24-inch refractor at the same\r\nobservatory, which is situated at an elevation of over 7,000 feet. His\r\nconclusion as to the reality of the canals is most positive; but in\r\naddition to his confirmation of their existence, he has put forward\r\nother views with regard to Mars which as yet have found comparatively\r\nfew supporters. He has pointed out that in almost all instances the\r\ncanals radiate from certain round spots which dot the surface of the\r\nplanet. These spots, which have been seen to a certain extent by\r\nother observers, he calls 'oases,' using the term in its ordinary\r\nterrestrial significance. His conclusions are, briefly, as follows:\r\nThat Mars has an atmosphere; that the dark regions are not seas, but\r\nmarshy tracts of vegetation; that the polar caps are snow and ice, and\r\nthe reddish portions of the surface desert land. The canals he holds\r\nto be waterways, lined on either bank by vegetation, so that we see,\r\nnot the actual canal, but the green strip of fertilized land through\r\nwhich it passes, while the round dark spots or 'oases' he believes to\r\nbe the actual population centres of the planet, where the inhabitants\r\ncluster to profit by the fertility created by the canals. In support\r\nof this view he adduces the observed fact that the canals and oases\r\nbegin to darken as the polar caps melt, and reasons that this implies\r\nthat the water set free by the melting of the polar snows is conveyed\r\nby artificial means to make the wilderness rejoice.\r\n\r\nLowell's theories may seem, very likely are, somewhat fanciful. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that the ground facts of his argument are\r\nat least unquestionable, whatever may be thought of his inferences.\r\nThe melting of the polar caps is matter of direct observation; nor\r\ncan it be questioned that it is followed by the darkening of the canal\r\nsystem. It is probably wiser not to dogmatize upon the reasons and\r\npurposes of these phenomena, for the very sufficient reason that we\r\nhave no means of arriving at any certitude. Terrestrial analogies\r\ncannot safely be used in connection with a globe whose conditions are\r\nso different from those of our own earth. The matter is well summed up\r\nby Miss Agnes Clerke: 'Evidently the relations of solid and liquid in\r\nthat remote orb are abnormal; they cannot be completely explained by\r\nterrestrial analogies. Yet a series of well-authenticated phenomena\r\nare intelligible only on the supposition that Mars is, in some real\r\nsense a terraqueous globe. Where snows melt there must be water; and\r\nthe origin of the Rhone from a great glacier is scarcely more evident\r\nto our senses than the dissolution of the Martian ice-caps into pools\r\nand streams.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\nChart of Mars. 'Memoirs of the British Astronomical Association,' Vol.\r\nXI., Part III., Plate VI.]\r\n\r\nClosely linked with the question of the existence of water on the\r\nplanet, and indeed a fundamental point in the settlement of it, is the\r\nfurther question of whether there is any aqueous vapour in the Martian\r\natmosphere. The evidence is somewhat conflicting. It is quite apparent\r\nthat in the atmosphere of Mars there is nothing like the volume of\r\nwater vapour which is present in that of the earth, for if there were,\r\nhis features would be much more frequently obscured by cloud than\r\nis found to be the case. Still there are many observations on record\r\nwhich seem quite unaccountable unless the occasional presence of\r\nclouds is allowed. Thus on May 21, 1903, Mr. Denning records that the\r\nSyrtis Major (see Chart, Plate XXI.) being then very dark and sharply\r\noutlined, a very bright region crossed its southern extremity. By May\r\n23, the Syrtis Major, 'usually the most conspicuous object in Mars,\r\nhad become extremely feeble, as if covered with highly reflective\r\nvapours.' On May 24, Mr. Phillips observed the region of Zephyria and\r\nAeolis to be also whitened, while the Syrtis Major was very faint; and\r\non the 25th, Mr. Denning observed the striking whiteness of the same\r\nregion observed by Mr. Phillips the day before. Illusion, so often\r\ninvoked to explain away inconvenient observations, seems here\r\nimpossible, in view of the prominence of the markings obscured, and\r\nthe experience of the observers; and the evidence seems strongly in\r\nfavour of real obscuration by cloud. It might have been expected that\r\nthe evidence of the spectroscope would in such a case be decisive, but\r\nCampbell's negative conclusion is balanced by the affirmative result\r\nreached by Huggins and Vogel. It is safe to say, however, that\r\nwhatever be the constitution of the Martian atmosphere, it is\r\nconsiderably less dense than our own air mantle.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years the public mind has been unusually exercised\r\nover Mars, largely by reason of a misapprehension of the terms\r\nemployed in the discussion about his physical features. The talk of\r\n'canals' has suggested human, or at all events intelligent, agency,\r\nand the expectation arose that it might not be quite impossible to\r\nestablish communication between our world and its nearest neighbour on\r\nthe further side. The idea is, of course, only an old one furbished up\r\nagain, for early in last century it was suggested that a huge triangle\r\nor ellipse should be erected on the Siberian steppes to show the\r\nLunarians or the Martians that we were intelligent creatures who\r\nknew geometry. In these circumstances curiosity was whetted by the\r\nannouncement, first made in 1890, and since frequently repeated, of\r\nthe appearance of bright projections on the terminator of Mars. These\r\nwere construed, by people with vivid imaginations, as signals from\r\nthe Martians to us; while a popular novelist suggested a more sinister\r\ninterpretation, and harrowed our feelings with weird descriptions of\r\nthe invasion of our world by Martian beings of uncouth appearance and\r\nsuperhuman intelligence, who were shot to our globe by an immense gun\r\nwhose flashes occasioned the bright projections seen. The projections\r\nwere, however, prosaically referred by Campbell to snow-covered\r\nmountains, while Lowell believed that one very large one observed at\r\nFlagstaff in May, 1903, was due to sunlight striking on a great cloud,\r\nnot of water-vapour, but of dust.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mars is somewhat disappointing to those who\r\napproach the study of his surface with the hope of finding traces of\r\nanything which might favour the idea of human habitation. He presents\r\nan apparently enticing general resemblance to the earth, with his\r\npolar caps and his bright and dark markings; and his curious network\r\nof canals may suggest intelligent agency. But the resemblances are\r\nnot nearly so striking when examined in detail. The polar caps are\r\nthe only features that seem to hold their own beside their terrestrial\r\nanalogues, and even their resemblance is not unquestioned; the dark\r\nareas, so long thought to be seas, are now proved to be certainly not\r\nseas, whatever else they may be; and the canal system presents nothing\r\nbut the name of similarity to anything that we know upon earth. It is\r\nquite probable that were Mars to come as near to us as our own moon,\r\nthe fancied resemblances would disappear almost entirely, and we\r\nshould find that the red planet is only another instance of the\r\ninfinite variety which seems to prevail among celestial bodies. That\r\nbeing so, it need scarcely be remarked that any talk about Martian\r\ninhabitants is, to say the least of it, premature. There may be such\r\ncreatures, and they may be anything you like to imagine. There is no\r\nrestraint upon the fancy, for no one knows anything about them, and no\r\none is in the least likely to know anything.\r\n\r\nThe moons of Mars are among the most curious finds of modern\r\nastronomy. When the ingenious Dr. Jonathan Swift, in editing the\r\ntravels of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, of Wapping, wrote that the astronomers\r\nof Laputa had discovered 'two lesser stars, or satellites, which\r\nrevolve about Mars,' the suggestion was, no doubt, put in merely\r\nbecause some detail of their skill had to be given, and as well\r\none unlikely thing as another. Probably no one would have been more\r\nsurprised than the Dean of St. Patrick's, had he lived long enough,\r\nor cared sixpence about the matter, to hear that his bow drawn at a\r\nventure had hit the mark, and that Professor Asaph Hall had detected\r\ntwo satellites of Mars. The discovery was one of the first-fruits of\r\nthe 26-inch Washington refractor, and was made in 1877, the year from\r\nwhich the new interest in Mars may be said to date. The two moons\r\nhave been called Deimos and Phobos, or Fear and Panic, and are, in\r\nall probability, among the very tiniest bodies of our system, as their\r\ndiameter can scarcely be greater than ten miles. Deimos revolves in an\r\norbit which takes him thirty hours eighteen minutes to complete, at\r\na distance of 14,600 miles from the centre of Mars. Phobos is much\r\nnearer the planet, his distance from its centre being 5,800, while\r\nfrom its surface he is distant only 3,700 miles. In consequence of\r\nthis nearness, he can never be seen by an observer on Mars from any\r\nlatitude higher than 69°, the bulge of the globe permanently shutting\r\nhim out from view. His period of revolution is only seven hours\r\nthirty-nine minutes, so that to the Martian inhabitants, if there are\r\nany, the nearer of the planet's moons must appear to rise in the west\r\nand set in the east. By the combination of its own revolution and the\r\nopposite rotation of Mars it will take about eleven hours to cross the\r\nheavens; and during that period it will go through all its phases and\r\nhalf through a second display.\r\n\r\nThese little moons are certainly among the most curious and\r\ninteresting bodies of the solar system; but, unfortunately, the sight\r\nof them is denied to most observers. That they were not seen by Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel with his great 4-foot reflector probably only points\r\nto the superior defining power of the 26-inch Washington refractor as\r\ncompared with Herschel's celebrated but cumbrous instrument. Still,\r\nthey were missed by many telescopes quite competent to show them, and\r\nof as good defining quality as the Washington instrument--a fact which\r\ngoes to add proof, if proof were needed, that the power which makes\r\ndiscoveries is the product of telescope × observer, and that of the\r\ntwo factors concerned the latter is the more important. It is said\r\nthat the moons have been seen by Dr. Wentworth Erck with a 7-1/3-inch\r\nrefractor. The ordinary observer is not likely to catch even a glimpse\r\nof them with anything much smaller than a 12-inch instrument, and even\r\nthen must use precautions to exclude the glare of the planet, and may\r\ncount himself lucky if he succeed in the observation.\r\n\r\nA word or two may be said as to what a beginner may expect to see with\r\na small instrument. It has been stated that nothing under 6 inches can\r\nmake much of Mars; but this is a somewhat exaggerated statement of the\r\ncase. It is quite certain that the bulk of the more prominent markings\r\ncan be seen with telescopes of much smaller aperture. Some detail\r\nhas been seen with only 1-3/4-inch, while Grover has, with a 2-inch,\r\nexecuted drawings which show how much can be done with but little\r\ntelescopic power. The fact is, that observers who are only in the\r\nhabit of using large telescopes are apt to be unduly sceptical of the\r\npowers of small ones, which are often wonderfully efficient. The fine\r\ndetail of the canal system is, of course, altogether beyond small\r\ninstruments; and, generally speaking, it will take at least a 4-inch\r\nto show even the more strongly marked of these strange features. At\r\nthe 1894 opposition, the writer, using a 3-7/8-inch Dollond of good\r\nquality, was able to detect several of the more prominent canals,\r\nbut only on occasions of the best definition. The accompanying rough\r\nsketch (Fig. 24) gives an idea of what may be expected to be seen,\r\nunder favourable conditions, with an instrument of between 2 and 3\r\ninches. It represents Mars as seen with a glass of 2-5/8-inch aperture\r\nand fair quality. The main marking in the centre of the disc is\r\nthat formerly known as the Kaiser or Hour-glass Sea. Its name in\r\nSchiaparelli's nomenclature, now universally used, is the Syrtis\r\nMajor. The same marking will also be seen in Mr. Phillips's drawing of\r\n1899, January 30, in which it is separated by a curious bright bridge\r\nfrom the Nilosyrtis to the North. The observer need scarcely expect to\r\nsee much more than is depicted in Fig. 24, with an instrument of\r\nthe class mentioned, but Plate XX. will give a very good idea of the\r\nappearance of the planet when viewed with a telescope of considerable\r\npower. The polar caps will be within reach, and sometimes present the\r\neffect of projecting above the general level of the planet's surface,\r\nowing, no doubt, to irradiation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.\r\n\r\nMARS, June 25, 1890, 10 hours 15 minutes; 2-5/8-inch, power 120.]\r\n\r\nTo the intending observer one important caution may be suggested. In\r\nobserving and sketching the surface of Mars, do so _independently_.\r\nThe chart which accompanies this chapter is given for the purpose of\r\nidentifying markings which have been already seen, not for that of\r\nenabling the observer to see details which are beyond the power of his\r\nglass. No planet has been the cause of more illusion than Mars, and\r\ndrawings of him are extant which resemble nothing so much as the\r\nphotograph of an umbrella which has been turned inside out by a gust\r\nof wind. In such cases it may reasonably be concluded that there is\r\nsomething wrong, and that, unconsciously, 'the vision and the faculty\r\ndivine' have been exercised at the expense of the more prosaic, but\r\nin this case more useful, quality of accuracy. By prolonged study of\r\na modern chart of Mars, and a little gentle stretching of the\r\nimagination, the most unskilled observer with the smallest instrument\r\nwill detect a multitude of canals upon the planet, to which there is\r\nbut one objection, that they do not exist. There is enough genuine\r\ninterest about Mars, even when viewed with a small glass, without the\r\nimportation of anything spurious. In observation it will be noticed\r\nthat as the rotation period of Mars nearly coincides with that of the\r\nearth, the change in the aspect presented from night to night will\r\nbe comparatively small, the same object coming to the meridian\r\nthirty-seven minutes later each successive evening. Generally\r\nspeaking, Mars is an easier object to define than either Venus or\r\nJupiter, though perhaps scarcely bearing high powers so well as\r\nSaturn. There is no planet more certain to repay study and to maintain\r\ninterest. He and Jupiter may be said to be at present the 'live'\r\nplanets of the solar system in an astronomical sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote *: The opposition of a planet occurs 'whenever\r\n    the sun, the earth, and the planet, as represented in their\r\n    projected orbits, are in a straight line, with the earth in\r\n    the middle.']\r\n\r\n    [Footnote †: That point in the orbit of a planet or comet\r\n    which is nearest to the sun.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ASTEROIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772 Bode of Berlin published the statement of a curiously\r\nsymmetrical relation existing among the planets of our system. The\r\ngist of this relation, known as Bode's law, though it was really\r\ndiscovered by Titius of Wittenberg, may be summed up briefly thus:\r\n'The interval between the orbits of any two planets is about twice as\r\ngreat as the inferior interval, and only half the superior one.'\r\nThus the distance between the orbits of the earth and Venus should,\r\naccording to Bode's law, be half of that between the earth and Mars,\r\nwhich again should be half of that which separates Mars from the\r\nplanet next beyond him. Since the discovery of Neptune, this so-called\r\nlaw has broken down, for Neptune is very far within the distance which\r\nit requires; but at the time of its promulgation it represented with\r\nconsiderable accuracy the actual relative positions of the planets,\r\nwith one exception. Between Mars and Jupiter there was a blank which\r\nshould, according to the law, have been filled by a planet, but to all\r\nappearance was not. Noticing this blank in the sequence, Bode ventured\r\nto predict that a planet would be found to fill it; and his foresight\r\nwas not long in being vindicated.\r\n\r\nSeveral continental astronomers formed a kind of planet-hunting\r\nsociety to look out for the missing orb; but their operations were\r\nanticipated by the discovery on January 1, 1801, of a small planet\r\nwhich occupied a place closely approximating to that indicated for the\r\nmissing body by Bode's law. The news of this discovery, made by Piazzi\r\nof Palermo in the course of observations for his well-known catalogue\r\nof stars, did not reach Bode till March 20, and 'the delay just\r\nafforded time for the publication, by a young philosopher of Jena\r\nnamed Hegel, of a \"Dissertation\" showing, by the clearest light of\r\nreason, that the number of the planets could not exceed seven, and\r\nexposing the folly of certain devotees of induction who sought a new\r\ncelestial body merely to fill a gap in a numerical series.'\r\n\r\nThe remarkable agreement of prediction and discovery roused a\r\nconsiderable amount of interest, though the planet actually found, and\r\nnamed Ceres after the patron-goddess of Sicily, seemed disappointingly\r\nsmall. But before very long Olbers, one of the members of the original\r\nplanet-hunting society, surprised the astronomical world by the\r\ndiscovery of a second planet which also fulfilled the condition of\r\nBode's law; and by the end of March, 1807, two other planets equally\r\nobedient to the required numerical standard were found, the first by\r\nHarding, the second by Olbers. Thus a system of four small planets,\r\nCeres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, was found to fill that gap in the\r\nseries which had originally suggested the search. To account for their\r\nexistence Olbers proposed the theory that they were the fragments of\r\na large planet which had been blown to pieces either by the disruptive\r\naction of internal forces or by collision with a comet; and this\r\ntheory remained in favour for a number of years, though accumulating\r\nevidence against it has forced its abandonment.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1845 that there was any addition to the number of the\r\nasteroids, as they had come to be named. In that year, however, Hencke\r\nof Driessen in Prussia, discovered a fifth, which has been named\r\nAstræa, and in 1847 repeated his success by the discovery of a sixth,\r\nHebe. Since that time there has been a steady flow of discoveries,\r\nuntil at the present time the number known to exist is close upon 700,\r\nof which 569 have received permanent numbers as undoubtedly distinct\r\nmembers of the solar system; and this total is being steadily added to\r\nyear by year, the average annual number of discoveries for the years\r\n1902 to 1905 inclusive, being fifty-two. For a time the search for\r\nminor planets was a most laborious business. The planet-hunter had\r\nto construct careful maps of all the stars visible in a certain small\r\nzone of the ecliptic, and to compare these methodically with the\r\nactual face of the sky in the same zone, as revealed by his telescope.\r\nAny star seen in the telescope, and not found to be marked upon the\r\nchart, became forthwith an object of grave suspicion, and was watched\r\nuntil its motion, or lack of motion, relatively to the other stars\r\neither proved or disproved its planetary nature. At present this\r\nlengthy and wearisome process has been entirely superseded by the\r\nphotographic method, in which a minor planet is detected by the fact\r\nthat, being in motion relatively to the fixed stars, its image will\r\nappear upon the plate in the shape of a short line or trail, the\r\nimages of the fixed stars being round dots. Of course the trail may be\r\ndue to a planet which has already been discovered; but should there\r\nbe no known minor planet in the position occupied by the trail, then\r\na new member has been added to the system. Minor-planet hunting\r\nhas always been a highly specialized branch of astronomy, and a few\r\nobservers, such as Peters, Watson, Charlois and Palisa, and at present\r\nWolf, have accounted for the great majority of the discoveries.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, becoming more and more a matter of question what\r\nadvantage was to be gained by the continuance of the hunt, when a\r\nfresh fillip was given to interest by the discovery in 1898 of the\r\nanomalous asteroid named Eros. Hitherto no minor planet had been known\r\nto have the greater portion of its orbit within that of Mars, though\r\nseveral do cross the red planet's borders; but the mean distance of\r\nEros from the sun proves to be about 135,000,000, while that of Mars\r\nis 141,000,000 miles. In addition, the orbit of the new planet is\r\nsuch that at intervals of sixty-seven years it comes within 15,000,000\r\nmiles of the earth, or in other words nearer to us than any other\r\ncelestial body except the moon or a chance comet. It may thus come\r\nto afford a means of revising estimates of celestial distances. Eros\r\npresents another peculiarity. It has been found by E. von Oppolzer\r\nto be variable in a period of two hours thirty-eight minutes; and the\r\ntheory has been put forward that the planet is double, consisting of\r\ntwo bodies which revolve almost in contact and mutually eclipse one\r\nanother--in short, that Eros as a planet presents the same phenomenon\r\nwhich we shall find as a characteristic of that type of variable stars\r\nknown as the Algol type. An explanation, in some respects more simple\r\nand satisfactory, is that the variation in light is caused by the\r\ndifferent reflective power of various parts of its surface; but the\r\nquestion is still open.\r\n\r\nThe best results for the sizes of the four asteroids first discovered\r\nare those of Barnard, from direct measurements with the Lick telescope\r\nin 1894. He found the diameter of Ceres to be 485 miles, that of\r\nPallas 304, those of Vesta and Juno 243 and 118 miles respectively.\r\nThere appears to be as great diversity in the reflective power of\r\nthese original members of the group as in their diameters. Ceres is\r\nlarge and dull, and, in Miss Clerke's words, 'must be composed of\r\nrugged and sombre rock, unclothed probably by any vestige of air,'\r\nwhile Vesta has a surface which reflects light with four times the\r\nintensity of that of Ceres, and is, in fact, almost as brilliantly\r\nwhite as newly fallen snow.\r\n\r\nIn the place of Olbers' discredited hypothesis of an exploded planet,\r\nhas now been set the theory first suggested by Kirkwood, that instead\r\nof having in the asteroids the remnants of a world which has become\r\ndefunct, we have the materials of one which was never allowed to\r\nform, the overwhelming power of Jupiter's attraction having exerted\r\na disruptive influence over them while their formation was still only\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, they share with Mars the distinction of being\r\nthe only celestial bodies which have been made the subjects of a\r\ntestamentary disposition. In the case of Mars, readers may remember\r\nthat some years ago a French lady left a large sum of money to be\r\ngiven to the individual who should first succeed in establishing\r\ncommunication with the Planet of War; in that of the asteroids, the\r\nlate Professor Watson, a mighty hunter of minor planets in his day,\r\nmade provision for the supervision of the twenty-two planets captured\r\nby him, lest any of them should get lost, stolen, or strayed.\r\n\r\nSmall telescopes are, of course, quite impotent to deal with such\r\ndiminutive bodies as the asteroids; nor, perhaps, is it desirable\r\nthat the ranks of the minor-planet hunters should be reinforced to any\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nJUPITER\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing outwards from the zone of the minor planets, we come to the\r\ngreatest and most magnificent member of the solar system, the giant\r\nplanet Jupiter. To most observers, Jupiter will probably appear not\r\nonly the largest, but also the most interesting telescopic object\r\nwhich our system affords. Some, no doubt, will put in a claim for\r\nMars, and some will share Sir Robert Ball's predilection for Saturn;\r\nbut the interest attaching to Mars is of quite a different character\r\nfrom that which belongs to Jupiter, and while Saturn affords a picture\r\nof unsurpassed beauty, there is not that interest of variety and\r\nchange in his exquisite system which is to be found in that of his\r\nneighbour planet. Jupiter is constantly attractive by reason of the\r\nhope, or rather the certainty, that he will always provide something\r\nfresh to observe; and the perpetual state of flux in which the details\r\nof his surface present themselves to the student offers to us the\r\nonly instance which can be conveniently inspected of the process of\r\nworld-formation. Jupiter is at the very opposite end of the scale\r\nfrom such a body, for example, as our own moon. On the latter it would\r\nappear as though all things were approaching the fixity of death; such\r\nchanges as are suspected are scarcely more than suspected, and,\r\neven if established, are comparatively so small as to tax the utmost\r\nresources of observation. On the former, such a thing as fixity or\r\nstability appears to be unknown, and changes are constantly occurring\r\non a scale so gigantic as not to be beyond the reach of small\r\ninstruments, at least in their broader outlines.\r\n\r\nThe main facts relating to the planet may be briefly given before\r\nwe go on to consider the physical features revealed to us by the\r\ntelescope. Jupiter then travels round the sun in a period of 11\r\nyears, 314·9 days, at an average distance of almost 483,000,000 miles.\r\nAccording to Barnard's measures, his polar diameter is 84,570, and his\r\nequatorial diameter 90,190 miles. He is thus compressed at the poles\r\nto the extent of 1/16th, and there is no planet which so conspicuously\r\nexhibits to the eye the actual effect of this polar flattening, though\r\nthe compression of Saturn is really greater still. In volume he is\r\nequal to more than 1,300 earths, but his density is so small that only\r\n316 of our worlds would be needed to balance him. This low density,\r\nnot much greater than that of water, is quite in accordance with all\r\nthe other features which are revealed by observation, and appears to\r\nbe common to all the members of that group of large exterior planets\r\nof which Jupiter is at once the first and the chief.\r\n\r\nThe brilliancy of the great planet is exceedingly remarkable, far\r\nexceeding that of Mars or Saturn, and only yielding to that of Venus.\r\nIn 1892 his lustre was double that of Sirius, which is by far the\r\nbrightest of all the fixed stars; and he has been repeatedly seen by\r\nthe unaided eye even when the sun was above the horizon. According to\r\none determination he reflects practically the same amount of light as\r\nnewly fallen snow; and even if this be rejected as impossibly high,\r\nZöllner's more moderate estimate, which puts his reflective power\r\nat 62 per cent. of the light received, makes him almost as bright as\r\nwhite paper. Yet to the eye it is very evident that his light has\r\na distinct golden tinge, and in the telescopic view this remains\r\nconspicuous, and is further emphasized by the presence on his disc of\r\na considerable variety of colouring.\r\n\r\nUnder favourable circumstances Jupiter presents to us a disc which\r\nmeasures as much as 50″ in diameter. The very low magnifying power of\r\n50 will therefore present him to the eye with a diameter of 2,500″,\r\nwhich is somewhat greater than the apparent diameter of the moon. In\r\npractice it is somewhat difficult to realize that this is the case,\r\nprobably owing to the want of any other object in the telescopic field\r\nwith which to compare the planet. But while there may be a little\r\ndisappointment at the seeming smallness of the disc even with a power\r\ndouble that suggested, this will quickly be superseded by a growing\r\ninterest in the remarkable picture which is revealed to view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.\r\n\r\nJUPITER, October 9, 1891, 9.30 p.m.; 3-7/8-inch, power 120.]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the ordinary appearance of the planet may be gained from\r\nFig. 25, which reproduces a sketch made with a small telescope on\r\nOctober 9, 1891. The first feature that strikes the eye on even the\r\nmost casual glance is the polar compression. The outline of the disc\r\nis manifestly not circular but elliptical, and this is emphasized by\r\nthe fact that nearly all the markings which are visible run parallel\r\nto one another in the direction of the longest diameter of the oval.\r\nA little attention will reveal these markings as a series of dark\r\nshadowy bands, of various breadths and various tones, which stretch\r\nfrom side to side of the disc, fading a little in intensity as they\r\napproach its margin, and giving the whole planet the appearance of\r\nbeing girdled by a number of cloudy belts. The belts may be seen with\r\nvery low powers indeed, the presence of the more conspicuous ones\r\nhaving repeatedly been evident to the writer with the rudimentary\r\ntelescope mentioned in Chapter II., consisting of a non-achromatic\r\ndouble convex lens of 1-1/2-inch aperture, and a single lens eye-piece\r\ngiving a power of 36. Anything larger and more perfect than this will\r\nbring them out with clearness, and an achromatic of from 2 to 3 inches\r\naperture will give views of the highest beauty and interest, and\r\nwill even enable its possessor to detect some of the more prominent\r\nevidences of the changes which are constantly taking place.\r\n\r\nThe number of belts visible varies very considerably. As many as\r\nthirty have sometimes been counted; but normally the number is much\r\nsmaller than this. Speaking generally, two belts, one on either side\r\nof a bright equatorial zone, will be found to be conspicuous, while\r\nfainter rulings may be traced further north and south, and the dusky\r\nhoods which cover the poles will be almost as easily seen as the\r\ntwo main belts. It will further become apparent that this system\r\nof markings is characterized by great variety of colouring. In this\r\nrespect no planet approaches Jupiter, and when seen under favourable\r\ncircumstances and with a good instrument, preferably a reflector,\r\nsome of the colour effects are most exquisite. Webb remarks: 'There is\r\noften \"something rich and strange\" in the colouring of the disc.\r\nLord Rosse describes yellow, brick-red, bluish, and even full-blue\r\nmarkings; Hirst, a belt edged with crimson lake; Miss Hirst, a small\r\nsea-green patch near one of the poles.' The following notes of colour\r\nwere made on December 26, 1905: The south equatorial belt distinct\r\nreddish-brown; the equatorial zone very pale yellow, almost white,\r\nwith faint slaty-blue shades in the northern portion; the north polar\r\nregions a decided reddish-orange; while the south polar hood was of a\r\nmuch colder greyish tone. But the colours are subject to considerable\r\nchange, and the variations of the two great equatorial belts appear,\r\naccording to Stanley Williams, to be periodic, maxima and minima of\r\nredness being separated by a period of about twelve years, and the\r\nmaximum of the one belt coinciding with the minimum of the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\nJupiter, January 6, 1906--8 hours 20 minutes. Instrument, 9-1/4-inch\r\nReflector.\r\n\r\n[lambda] = 238° (System 1); [lambda] = 55° (System 2).\r\n\r\nRev. T. E. R. Phillips.]\r\n\r\nThese changes in colouring bring us to the fact that the whole system\r\nof the Jovian markings is liable to constant and often very rapid\r\nchange. Anyone who compares drawings made a few years ago with those\r\nmade at the present time, such as Plates XXII. and XXIII., cannot fail\r\nto notice that while there is a general similarity, the details have\r\nchanged so much that there is scarcely one individual feature which\r\nhas not undergone some modification. Indeed, this process of change is\r\nsometimes so rapid that it can be actually watched in its occurrence.\r\nThus Mr. Denning remarks that 'on October 17, 1880, two dark spots,\r\nseparated by 20° of longitude, broke out on a belt some 25° north\r\nof the equator. Other spots quickly formed on each side of the pair\r\nalluded to, and distributed themselves along the belt, so that by\r\nDecember 30 they covered three-fourths of its entire circumference.'\r\nThe dark belts, according to his observations, 'appear to be sustained\r\nin certain cases by eruptions of dark matter, which gradually spread\r\nout into streams.'\r\n\r\nEven the great equatorial belts are not exempt from the continual flux\r\nwhich affects all the markings of the great planet, and the details\r\nof their structure will be found to vary to a considerable extent at\r\ndifferent periods. At present the southern belt is by far the most\r\nconspicuous feature of the surface, over-powering all other details by\r\nits prominence, while its northern rival has shrunk in visibility to\r\na mere shadow of what it appears in drawings made in the seventies.\r\nThrough all the changes of the last thirty years, however, one very\r\nremarkable feature of the planet has remained permanent at least in\r\nform, though varying much in visibility. With the exception of the\r\ncanals of Mars, no feature of any of the planets has excited so\r\nmuch interest as the great red spot on Jupiter. The history of this\r\nextraordinary phenomenon as a subject of general study begins in 1878,\r\nthough records exist as far back as 1869 of a feature which almost\r\ncertainly was the same, and it has been suggested that it was observed\r\nby Cassini two centuries ago. In 1878 it began to attract general\r\nattention, which it well deserved. In appearance it was an enormous\r\nellipse of a full brick-red colour, measuring some 30,000 miles in\r\nlength by 7,000 in breadth, and lying immediately south of the south\r\nequatorial belt. With this belt it appears to have some mysterious\r\nconnection. It is not actually joined to it, but seems, as Miss\r\nClerke observes, to be 'jammed down upon it'; at least, in the south\r\nequatorial belt, just below where the spot lies, there has been formed\r\nan enormous bay, bounded on the following side (_i.e._, the right\r\nhand as the planet moves through the field), by a sharply upstanding\r\nshoulder or cape. The whole appearance of this bay irresistibly\r\nsuggests to the observer that it has somehow or other been hollowed\r\nout to make room for the spot, which floats, as it were, within it,\r\nsurrounded generally by a margin of bright material, which divides it\r\nfrom the brown matter of the belt. The red spot, with its accompanying\r\nbay and cape, is shown in Fig. 25 and in Plate XXII., which represents\r\nthe planet as seen by the Rev. T. E. R. Phillips on January 6, 1906.\r\nThe spot has varied very much in colour and in visibility, but on the\r\nwhole its story has been one of gradual decline; its tint has paled,\r\nand its outline has become less distinct, as though it were being\r\nobscured by an outflow of lighter-coloured matter, though there have\r\nbeen occasional recoveries both of colour and distinctness. In 1891 it\r\nwas a perfectly easy object with 3-7/8 inches; at the present time\r\nthe writer has never found it anything but difficult with an 18-inch\r\naperture, though some observers have been able to see it steadily in\r\n1905 and 1906 with much smaller telescopes. The continued existence\r\nof the bay already referred to seems to indicate that it is only the\r\ncolour of the spot that has temporarily paled, and that observers may\r\nin course of time witness a fresh development of this most interesting\r\nJovian feature.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the red spot remains an enigma. It may possibly\r\nrepresent an opening in the upper strata of Jupiter's dense\r\ncloud-envelope, through which lower strata, or even the real body of\r\nthe planet, may be seen. The suggestion has also been made that it is\r\nthe glow of some volcanic fire on the body of the planet, seen through\r\nthe cloud-screen as the light of a lamp is seen through ground-glass.\r\nBut, after all, such ideas are only conjectures, and it is impossible\r\nto say as yet even whether the spot is higher or lower than the\r\naverage level of the surface round it. A curious phenomenon which\r\nwas witnessed in 1891 suggested at first a hope that this question of\r\nrelative height would at least be determined. This phenomenon was the\r\novertaking of the red spot by a dark spot which had been travelling\r\nafter it on the same parallel, but with greater speed, for some\r\nmonths. It appeared to be quite certain that the dark spot must either\r\ntransit the face of the red spot or else pass behind it; and in either\r\ncase interesting information as to the relative elevations of the two\r\nfeatures in question would have been obtained. The dark spot, however,\r\ndisappointed expectation by drifting round the south margin of the red\r\none, much as the current of a river is turned aside by the buttress of\r\na bridge. In fact, it would almost appear as though the red spot had\r\nthe power of resisting any pressure from other parts of the planet's\r\nsurface; yet in itself it has no fixity, for its period of rotation\r\nsteadily lengthened for several years until 1899, since when it has\r\nbegun to shorten again, so that it would appear to float upon the\r\nsurface of currents of variable speed rather than to be an established\r\nlandmark of the globe itself. The rotation period derived from it was,\r\nin 1902, 9 hours 55 minutes 39·3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the changing period of rotation of the red spot lends\r\nemphasis to the fact that no single period of rotation can be assigned\r\nto Jupiter as a whole. It is impossible to say of the great planet\r\nthat he rotates in such and such a period: the utmost that can be said\r\nis that certain spots upon his surface have certain rotation periods;\r\nbut these periods are almost all different from one another, and even\r\nthe period of an individual marking is subject, as already seen, to\r\nvariation. In fact, as Mr. Stanley Williams has shown, no fewer than\r\nnine different periods of rotation are found to coexist upon the\r\nsurface; and though the differences in the periods seem small when\r\nexpressed in time, amounting in the extreme cases only to eight and\r\nhalf minutes, yet their significance is very great indeed. In the case\r\nof Mr. Williams's Zones II. and III., the difference in speed of these\r\ntwo surface currents amounts to 400 miles per hour. Certain bright\r\nspots near the equator have been found to move so much more rapidly\r\nthan the great red spot as to pass it at a speed of 260 miles an hour,\r\nand to 'lap' it in forty-four and a half days, completing in that time\r\none whole rotation more than their more imposing neighbour. It cannot,\r\ntherefore, be said that Jupiter's rotation period is known; but the\r\naverage period of his surface markings is somewhere about nine hours\r\nfifty-two minutes.\r\n\r\nThus the rotation period adds its evidence to that already afforded\r\nby the variations in colour and in form of the planet's markings that\r\nhere we are dealing with a body in a very different condition from\r\nthat of any of the other members of our system hitherto met with. We\r\nhave here no globe whose actual surface we can scrutinize, as we can\r\nin the case of Mars and the moon, but one whose solid nucleus, if\r\nit has such a thing, is perpetually veiled from us by a mantle which\r\nseems more akin to the photosphere of the sun than to anything else\r\nthat we are acquainted with. The obvious resemblances may, and very\r\nprobably do, mask quite as important differences. The mere difference\r\nin scale between the two bodies concerned must be a very important\r\nfactor, to say nothing of other causes which may be operative in\r\nproducing unlikeness. Still, there is a considerable and suggestive\r\ngeneral resemblance.\r\n\r\nIn the sun and in Jupiter alike we have a view, not of the true\r\nsurface, but of an envelope which seems to represent the point of\r\ncondensation of currents of matter thrown up from depths below--an\r\nenvelope agitated in both cases, though more slowly in that of\r\nJupiter, by disturbances which bear witness to the operation of\r\nstupendous forces beneath its veil. In both bodies there is a similar\r\nsmall density: neither the sun nor Jupiter is much denser than water;\r\nin both the determination of the rotation period is complicated by\r\nthe fact that the markings of the bright envelope by which the\r\ndeterminations must be made move with entirely different speeds in\r\ndifferent latitudes. Here, however, there is a divergence, for while\r\nin the case of the sun the period increases uniformly from the equator\r\nto the poles, there is no such uniformity in the case of Jupiter. Thus\r\ncertain dark spots in 25° north latitude were found in 1880 to have a\r\nshorter period than even the swift equatorial white markings.\r\n\r\nOne further circumstance remains to be noted in pursuance of these\r\nresemblances. Not only does the disc of Jupiter shade away at its\r\nedges in a manner somewhat similar to that of the sun, being much\r\nmore brilliant in the centre than at the limb, but his remarkable\r\nbrilliancy, already noticed, has given rise to the suggestion that to\r\nsome small extent he may shine by his own inherent light. There are\r\ncertain difficulties, however, in the way of such a suggestion. The\r\nsatellites, for example, disappear absolutely when they enter the\r\nshadow of their great primary--a fact which is conclusive against the\r\nlatter being self-luminous to anything more than a very small extent,\r\nas even a small emission of native light from Jupiter would suffice\r\nto render them visible. But even supposing that the idea of\r\nself-luminosity has to be abandoned, everything points to the fact\r\nthat in Jupiter we have a body which presents much stronger analogies\r\nto the sun than to those planets of the solar system which we have\r\nso far considered. The late Mr. R. A. Proctor's conclusion probably\r\nrepresents the true state of the case with regard to the giant planet:\r\n'It may be regarded as practically proved that Jupiter's condition\r\nrather resembles that of a small sun which has nearly reached the dark\r\nstage than that of a world which is within a measurable time-interval\r\nfrom the stage of orb-life through which our own Earth is passing.'\r\n\r\nLeaving the planet itself, we turn to the beautiful system of\r\nsatellites of which it is the centre. The four moons which, till 1892,\r\nwere thought to compose the complete retinue of Jupiter, were among\r\nthe first-fruits of Galileo's newly-invented telescope, and were\r\ndiscovered in January, 1610. The names attached to them--Io, Europa,\r\nGanymede, and Callisto--have now been almost discarded in favour of\r\nthe more prosaic but more convenient numbers I., II., III., IV. The\r\nquestion of their visibility to the unaided eye has been frequently\r\ndiscussed, but with little result; nor is it a matter of much\r\nimportance whether or not some person exceptionally gifted with\r\nkeenness of sight may succeed in catching a momentary glimpse of one\r\nwhich happens to be favourably placed. The smallest telescope or a\r\nfield-glass will show them quite clearly. They are, in fact, bodies\r\nof considerable size, III., which is the largest, being 3,558 miles\r\nin diameter, while IV. is only about 200 miles less; and a moderate\r\nmagnifying power will bring out their discs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\nJupiter, February 17, 1906. J. Baikie, 18-inch Reflector.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful symmetry of this miniature system was broken in 1892 by\r\nBarnard's discovery of a fifth satellite--so small and so close to the\r\ngreat planet that very few telescopes are of power sufficient to show\r\nit. This was followed in 1904 by Perrine's discovery, from photographs\r\ntaken at the Lick Observatory with the Crossley reflector, of two\r\nmore members of the system, so that the train of Jupiter as at present\r\nknown numbers seven. The fifth, sixth, and seventh satellites are, of\r\ncourse, far beyond the powers of any but the very finest instruments,\r\ntheir diameters being estimated at 120, 100, and 30 miles\r\nrespectively. It will be a matter of interest, however, for the\r\nobserver to follow the four larger satellites, and to watch their\r\nrapid relative changes of position; their occultations, when they pass\r\nbehind the globe of Jupiter; their eclipses, when they enter the great\r\ncone of shadow which the giant planet casts behind him into space;\r\nand, most beautiful of all, their transits. In occultations the\r\ncurious phenomenon is sometimes witnessed of an apparent flattening of\r\nthe planet's margin as the satellite approaches it at ingress or draws\r\naway from it at egress. This strange optical illusion, which also\r\noccurs occasionally in the case of transits, was witnessed by several\r\nobservers on various dates during the winter of 1905-1906. It is, of\r\ncourse, merely an illusion, but it is curious why it should happen on\r\nsome occasions and not on others, when to all appearance the seeing is\r\nof very much the same quality. The gradual fading away of the light of\r\nthe satellites as they enter into eclipse is also a very interesting\r\nfeature, but the transits are certainly the most beautiful objects of\r\nall for a small instrument. The times of all these events are given in\r\nsuch publications as the 'Nautical Almanac' or the 'Companion to the\r\nObservatory'; but should the student not be possessed of either of\r\nthese most useful publications, he may notice that when a satellite is\r\nseen steadily approaching Jupiter on the following side, a transit\r\nis impending. The satellite will come up to the margin of the planet,\r\nlooking like a brilliant little bead of light as it joins itself to\r\nit (a particularly exquisite sight), will glide across the margin, and\r\nafter a longer or shorter period will become invisible, being merged\r\nin the greater brightness of the central portions of Jupiter's disc,\r\nunless it should happen to traverse one of the dark belts, in which\r\ncase it may be visible throughout its entire journey. It will be\r\nfollowed or preceded, according to the season, by its shadow, which\r\nwill generally appear as a dark circular dot. In transits which occur\r\nbefore opposition the shadows precede the satellites; after opposition\r\nthey travel behind them. The transit of the satellite itself will\r\nin most cases be a pretty sharp test of the performance of a 3-inch\r\ntelescope, or anything below that aperture; but the transit of the\r\nshadow may be readily seen with a 2-1/2-inch, probably even with a\r\n2-inch. There are certain anomalies in the behaviour of the shadows\r\nwhich have never been satisfactorily explained. They have not always\r\nbeen seen of a truly circular form, nor always of the same degree of\r\ndarkness, that of the second satellite being notably lighter in most\r\ninstances than those of the others. There are few more beautiful\r\ncelestial pictures than that presented by Jupiter with a satellite and\r\nits shadow in transit. The swift rotation of the great planet and the\r\nrapid motion of the shadow can be very readily observed, and the whole\r\naffords a most picturesque illustration of celestial mechanics.\r\n\r\nA few notes may be added with regard to observation. In drawing the\r\nplanet regard must first of all be paid to the fact that Jupiter's\r\ndisc is not circular, and should never be so represented. It is easy\r\nfor the student to prepare for himself a disc of convenient size, say\r\nabout 2-1/2 inches in diameter on the major axis, and compressed\r\nto the proper extent (1/16), which may be used in outlining all\r\nsubsequent drawings. Within the outline thus sketched the details must\r\nbe drawn with as great rapidity as is consistent with accuracy. The\r\nreason for rapidity will soon become obvious. Jupiter's period of\r\nrotation is so short that the aspect of his disc will be found to\r\nchange materially even in half an hour. Indeed, twenty minutes\r\nis perhaps as long as the observer should allow himself for any\r\nindividual drawing, and a little practice will convince him that it\r\nis quite possible to represent a good deal of detail in that time, and\r\nthat, even with rapid work, the placing of the various markings may be\r\nmade pretty accurate. The darker and more conspicuous features should\r\nbe laid down first of all, and the more delicate details thereafter\r\nfilled in, care being taken to secure first those near the preceding\r\nmargin of the planet before they are carried out of view by rotation.\r\nThe colours of the various features should be carefully noted at\r\nthe sides of the original drawings, and for this work twilight\r\nobservations are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nDifferent observers vary to some extent, as might be expected, in\r\ntheir estimates of the planet's colouring, but on the whole there is\r\na broad general agreement. No planet presents such a fine opportunity\r\nfor colour-study as Jupiter, and on occasions of good seeing the\r\nrichness of the tones is perfectly astonishing. In showing the natural\r\ncolours of the planet the reflector has a great advantage over the\r\nrefractor, and observers using the reflecting type of instrument\r\nshould devote particular attention to this branch of the subject, as\r\nthere is no doubt that the colour of the various features is liable to\r\nconsiderable, perhaps seasonal, variation, and systematic observation\r\nof its changes may prove helpful in solving the mystery of Jupiter's\r\ncondition. The times of beginning and ending observation should be\r\ncarefully noted, and also the magnifying powers employed. These should\r\nnot be too high. Jupiter does not need, and will not stand, so much\r\nenlargement as either Mars or Saturn. It is quite easy to secure\r\na very large disc, but over-magnifying is a great deal worse than\r\nuseless: it is a fertile source of mistakes and illusions. If the\r\nstudent be content to make reasonable use of his means, and not to\r\noverpress either his instrument or his imagination, he will find upon\r\nJupiter work full of absorbing interest, and may be able to make his\r\nown contribution to the serious study of the great planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSATURN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt nearly double the distance of Jupiter from the sun circles the\r\nsecond largest planet of our system, unique, so far as human knowledge\r\ngoes, in the character of its appendages. The orbit of Saturn has a\r\nmean radius of 886,000,000 miles, but owing to its eccentricity, his\r\ndistance may be diminished to 841,000,000 or increased to 931,000,000.\r\nThis large variation may not play so important a part in his economy\r\nas might have been supposed, owing to the fact that the sun heat\r\nreceived by him is not much more than 1/100th of that received by the\r\nearth. The planet occupies twenty-nine and a half years in travelling\r\nround its immense orbit. Barnard's measures with the Lick telescope\r\ngive for the polar diameter 69,770, and for the equatorial 76,470\r\nmiles. Saturn's polar compression is accordingly very great, amounting\r\nto about 1/12th. Generally speaking, however, it is not so obvious\r\nin the telescopic view as the smaller compression of Jupiter, being\r\nmasked by the proximity of the rings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\nSaturn, July 2, 1894. E. E. Barnard, 36-inch Equatorial.]\r\n\r\nSaturn is the least dense of all the planets; in fact, this enormous\r\nglobe, nine times the diameter of the earth, would float in water.\r\nThis fact of extremely low density at once suggests a state of matters\r\nsimilar to that already seen to exist, in all likelihood, in the case\r\nof Jupiter; and all the evidence goes to support the view that Saturn,\r\nalong with the other three large exterior planets, is in the condition\r\nof a semi-sun.\r\n\r\nThe globe presents, on the whole, similar characteristics to those\r\nalready noticed as prevailing on Jupiter, but, as was to be expected,\r\nin a condition enfeebled by the much greater distance across which\r\nthey are viewed and the smaller scale on which they are exhibited.\r\nIt is generally girdled by one or two tropical belts of a grey-green\r\ntone; the equatorial region is yellow, and sometimes, like the\r\ncorresponding region of Jupiter, bears light spots upon it and a\r\nnarrow equatorial band of a dusky tone; the polar regions are of a\r\ncold ashy or leaden colour. Professor Barnard's fine drawing (Plate\r\nXXIV.) gives an admirable representation of these features as seen\r\nwith the 36-inch Lick telescope. Altogether, whether from greater\r\ndistance or from intrinsic deficiency, the colouring of Saturn is by\r\nno means so vivid or so interesting as that of his larger neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe period of rotation was, till within the last few years, thought\r\nto be definitely and satisfactorily ascertained. Sir William Herschel\r\nfixed it, from his observations, at ten hours sixteen minutes.\r\nProfessor Asaph Hall, from observations of a white spot near the\r\nequator, reduced this period to ten hours fourteen minutes twenty-four\r\nseconds. Stanley Williams and Denning, in 1891, reached results\r\ndiffering only by about two seconds from that of Hall; but the former,\r\ndiscussing observations of 1893, arrived at the conclusion that there\r\nwere variations of rotation presented in different latitudes and\r\nlongitudes of the planet's surface, the longest period being ten hours\r\nfifteen minutes, and the shortest ten hours twelve minutes forty-five\r\nseconds. Subsequently Keeler obtained, by spectroscopic methods, a\r\nresult exactly agreeing with that of Hall. It appeared, therefore,\r\nthat fairly satisfactory agreement had been reached on a mean period\r\nof ten hours fourteen minutes twenty-four seconds.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, however, a number of bright spots appeared in a middle north\r\nlatitude which, when observed by Barnard, Comas Solà, Denning, and\r\nother observers, gave a period remarkably longer than that deduced\r\nfrom spots in lower latitudes--namely, about ten hours thirty-eight\r\nminutes. Accordingly, it follows that the surface of Saturn's\r\nequatorial regions rotates much more rapidly than that of the regions\r\nfurther north--a state of affairs which presents an obvious likeness\r\nto that prevailing on Jupiter. But in the case of Saturn the\r\nequatorial current must move relatively to the rest of the surface at\r\nthe enormous rate of from 800 to 900 miles an hour, a speed between\r\nthree and four times greater than that of the corresponding current on\r\nJupiter!\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between the two great planets is thus very marked\r\nindeed. Great size, coupled with small density; very rapid rotation,\r\nwith its accompaniment of large polar compression; and, even more\r\nmarkedly in the case of the more distant planet than in that of\r\nJupiter, a variety of rotation periods for different markings, which\r\nindicates that these features have been thrown up from different\r\nstrata of the planet's substance--such points of likeness are too\r\nsignificant to be ignored. It is not at all likely that Saturn has\r\nany solidity to speak of, any more than Jupiter; the probabilities all\r\npoint in the direction of a comparatively small nucleus of somewhat\r\ngreater solidity than the rest, surrounded by an immense condensation\r\nshell, where the products of various eruptions are represented.\r\n\r\nWere this all that can be said about Saturn, the planet would scarcely\r\nbe more than a reduced and somewhat less interesting edition of\r\nJupiter. As it is, he possesses characteristics which make him\r\nJupiter's rival in point of interest, and, as a mere telescopic\r\npicture, perhaps even his superior. When Galileo turned his telescope\r\nupon Saturn, he was presented with what seemed an insoluble enigma.\r\nIt appeared to him that, instead of being a single globe, the planet\r\nconsisted of three globes in contact with one another; and this\r\nsupposed fact he intimated to Kepler in an anagram, which, when\r\nrearranged, read: 'Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi'--'I\r\nhave observed the most distant planet to be threefold.' Under better\r\nconditions of observation, he remarked subsequently, the planet\r\nappeared like an olive, as it still does with low powers. This was\r\nsufficiently puzzling, but worse was to follow. After an interval,\r\non observing Saturn again, he found that the appearances which had so\r\nperplexed him had altogether disappeared; the globe was single, like\r\nthose of the other planets. In his letter to Welser, dated December\r\n4, 1612, the great astronomer describes his bewilderment, and his\r\nfear lest, after all, it should turn out that his adversaries had been\r\nright, and that his discoveries had been mere illusions.\r\n\r\nThen followed a period when observers could only command optical power\r\nsufficient to show the puzzling nature of the planet's appendages,\r\nwithout revealing their true form. It appeared that Saturn had 'ansæ,'\r\nor handles, on either side of him, between which and his body the\r\nsky could be seen; and many uncouth figures are still preserved which\r\neloquently testify to the bewilderment of those who drew them, though\r\nsome of them are wonderfully accurate representations of the planet's\r\nappearance when seen with insufficient means. The bewilderment was\r\nsometimes veiled, in amusing cuttle-fish fashion, under an inky cloud\r\nof sesquipedalian words. Thus Hevelius describes the aspects of Saturn\r\nin the following blasting flight of projectiles: 'The mono-spherical,\r\nthe tri-spherical, the spherico-ansated, the elliptico-ansated,\r\nand the spherico-cuspidated,' which is very beautiful no doubt, but\r\nscarcely so simple as one could wish a popular explanation to be.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1659, however, Huygens, who had been observing Saturn with\r\na telescope of 2-1/3 inches aperture and 23 feet focal length, bearing\r\na magnifying power of 100, arrived at the correct solution of the\r\nmystery, which he announced to, or rather concealed from, the world\r\nin a barbarous jumble of letters, which, when properly arranged, read\r\n'annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad eclipticam\r\ninclinato'--'he (Saturn) is surrounded by a thin flat ring, nowhere\r\ntouching (him, and) inclined to the ecliptic.' Huygens also discovered\r\nthe first and largest of Saturn's satellites, Titan. His discoveries\r\nwere followed by those of Cassini, who in 1676 announced his\r\nobservation of that division in the ring which now goes by his name.\r\nFrom Cassini's time onwards to the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\nnothing was observed to alter to any great extent the conception\r\nof the Saturnian system which had been reached; though certain\r\nobservations were made, which, though viewed with some suspicion,\r\nseemed to indicate that there were more divisions in the ring than\r\nthat which Cassini had discovered, and that the system was thus a\r\nmultiple one. In particular a marking on the outer ring was detected\r\nby Encke, and named after him, though generally seen, if seen at all,\r\nrather as a faint shading than as a definite division. (It is not\r\nshown in Barnard's drawing, Plate XXIV.). But in 1850 came the last\r\ngreat addition to our knowledge of the ring system, W. C. Bond in\r\nAmerica, and Dawes in England making independently the discovery of\r\nthe faint third ring, known as the Crape Ring, which lies between the\r\ninner bright ring and the globe.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary appendages thus gradually revealed present a\r\nconstantly varying aspect according to the seasons of the long\r\nSaturnian year. At Saturn's equinoxes they disappear, being turned\r\nedgewise; then, reappearing, they gradually broaden until at the\r\nsolstice, 7-1/3 years later, they are seen at their widest expansion;\r\nwhile from this point they narrow again to the following equinox,\r\nand repeat the same process with the opposite side of the ring\r\nilluminated, the whole set of changes being gone through in 29 years\r\n167·2 days. Barnard's measures give for the outer diameter of the\r\nouter ring 172,310 miles; while the clear interval between the inner\r\nmargin of the Crape Ring and the ball is about 5,800 miles, and the\r\nwidth of the great division in the ring-system (Cassini's) 2,270\r\nmiles. In sharp contrast to these enormous figures is the fact\r\nthat the rings have no measurable thickness at all, and can only be\r\nestimated at not more than 50 miles. They disappear absolutely when\r\nseen edgewise; even the great Lick telescope lost them altogether for\r\nthree days in October, 1891.[*]\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question of what may be the constitution of these\r\nremarkable features may now be given with a moderate approach to\r\ncertainty. It has been shown successively that the rings could not be\r\nsolid, or liquid, and in 1857 Clerk-Maxwell demonstrated that the only\r\npossible constitution for such a body is that of an infinite number\r\nof small satellites. The rings of Saturn thus presumably consist of\r\nmyriads of tiny moonlets, each pursuing its own individual orbit\r\nin its individual period, and all drawn to their present form of\r\naggregation by the attraction of Saturn's bulging equator. The\r\nappearances presented by the rings are explicable on this theory, and\r\non no other. Thus the brightness of the two rings A and B would arise\r\nfrom the closer grouping of the satellites within these zones; while\r\nthe semi-darkness of the Crape Ring arises from the sparser sprinkling\r\nof the moonlets, which allows the dark sky to be seen between them.\r\nCassini's division corresponds to a zone which has been deprived of\r\nsatellites; and as it has been shown that this vacant zone occupies a\r\nposition where a revolving body would be subject to disturbance from\r\nfour of Saturn's satellites, the force which cleared this gap in the\r\nring is obvious. It has been urged as an objection to the satellite\r\ntheory that while the thin spreading of the moonlets would account for\r\nthe comparative darkness of the Crape Ring when seen against the sky,\r\nit by no means accounts for the fact that this ring is seen as a dark\r\nstripe upon the body of the planet. Seeliger's explanation of this is\r\nboth satisfactory and obvious, when once suggested--namely, that the\r\ndarkness of the Crape Ring against the planet is due to the fact that\r\nwhat we see is not the actual transits of the satellites themselves,\r\nbut the perpetual flitting of their shadows across the ball. The final\r\nand conclusive argument in favour of this theory of the constitution\r\nof the rings was supplied by the late Professor Keeler by means of the\r\nspectroscope. It is evident that if the rings were solid, the speed\r\nof rotation should increase from their inner to their outer\r\nmargin--_i.e._, the outer margin must move faster, in miles per\r\nsecond, than the inner does. If, on the contrary, the rings are\r\ncomposed of a great number of satellites, the relation will be exactly\r\nreversed, and, owing to the superior attractive force exercised upon\r\nthem by the planet through their greater nearness to him, the inner\r\nsatellites will revolve faster than the outer ones. Now, this point\r\nis capable of settlement by spectroscopic methods involving the\r\napplication of the well-known Doppler's principle, that the speed of a\r\nbody's motion produces definite and regular effects upon the pitch of\r\nthe light emitted or reflected by it. The measurements were of extreme\r\ndelicacy, but the result was to give a rate of motion of 12-1/2 miles\r\nper second for the inner edge of ring B, and of 10 miles for the outer\r\nedge of A, thus affording unmistakable confirmation of the satellite\r\ntheory of the rings. Keeler's results have since been confirmed by\r\nCampbell and others; and it may be regarded as a demonstrated fact\r\nthat the rings, as already stated, consist of a vast number of small\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that the ball of Saturn is eccentrically placed\r\nwithin the ring, and further, that this eccentricity is essential to\r\nthe stability of the system; while the suggestion has also been made\r\nthat the ring-system is undergoing progressive change, and that the\r\ninterval between it and the ball is lessening. It has to be noticed,\r\nhowever, that the best measures, those of Barnard, indicate that the\r\nball is symmetrically placed within the rings; and the suggestion of a\r\ndiminishing interval between the ring-system and the ball receives no\r\ncountenance from comparison of the measures which have been made at\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that of all objects presented to observation\r\nin the solar system, there is not one, which, for mere beauty and\r\nsymmetry can be for a moment compared with Saturn, even though, as\r\nalready indicated, Mars and Jupiter present features of more lasting\r\ninterest. To quote Proctor's words: 'The golden disc, faintly striped\r\nwith silver-tinted belts; the circling rings, with their various\r\nshades of brilliancy and colour; and the perfect symmetry of the\r\nsystem as it sweeps across the dark background of the field of\r\nview, combine to form a picture as charming as it is sublime and\r\nimpressive.' Fortunately the main features of this beautiful picture\r\nare within the reach of very humble instruments. Webb states that\r\nwhen the ring system was at its greatest breadth he has seen it with\r\na power of about twenty on only 1-1/3-inch aperture. A beginner cannot\r\nexpect to do so much with such small means; but at all events a 2-inch\r\ntelescope with powers of from 50 to 100 will reveal the main outlines\r\nof the ring very well indeed, and, with careful attention will show\r\nthe shadow of the ring upon the ball, and that of the ball upon the\r\nring. When we come to the question of the division in the ring, we are\r\non somewhat more doubtful ground. Proctor affirms that 'the division\r\nin the ring (Cassini's) can be seen in a good 2-inch aperture in\r\nfavourable weather.' One would have felt inclined to say that the\r\nweather would require to be very favourable indeed, were it not that\r\nProctor's statement is corroborated by Denning, who remarks that\r\n'With a 2-inch refractor, power about ninety, not only are the rings\r\nsplendidly visible, but Cassini's division is readily glimpsed, as\r\nwell as the narrow dark belt on the body of the planet.' The student\r\nmay, however, be warned against expecting that such statements will\r\napply to his own individual efforts. There are comparatively few\r\nobservers whose eyes have had such systematic training as to qualify\r\nthem for work like this, and those who begin by expecting to see all\r\nthat skilled observers see with an instrument of the same power are\r\nonly laying up for themselves stores of disappointment. Mr. Mee's\r\nfrank confession may be commended to the notice of those who hope to\r\nsee at the first glance all that old students have learned to see\r\nby years of hard work. 'The first time I saw Saturn through a large\r\ntelescope, a fine 12-inch reflector, I confess I could not see\r\nthe division (Cassini's), though the view of the planet was one of\r\nexquisite beauty and long to be remembered, and notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the much fainter division of Encke was at the moment visible\r\nto the owner of the instrument!' It is extremely unlikely that the\r\nbeginner will see the division with anything much less than 3 inches,\r\nand even with that aperture he will not see it until the rings are\r\nwell opened. The writer's experience is that it is not by any means so\r\nreadily seen as is sometimes supposed. Three inches will show it under\r\ngood conditions; with 3-7/8 it can be steadily held, even when the\r\nrings are only moderately open (steady holding is a very different\r\nthing from 'glimpsing'), but even with larger apertures the division\r\nbecomes by no means a simple object as the rings close up (Fig. 26).\r\nIn fact, there is nothing better fitted to fill the modern observer's\r\nmind with a most wholesome respect for the memory of a man like\r\nCassini, than the thought that with his most imperfect appliances this\r\ngreat observer detected the division, a much more difficult feat than\r\nthe mere seeing it when its existence and position are already known,\r\nand discovered also four of the Saturnian satellites. As for the minor\r\ndivisions in the ring, if they are divisions, they are out of the\r\nquestion altogether for small apertures, and are often invisible even\r\nto skilled observers using the finest telescopes. Barnard's drawing\r\n(Plate XXIV.), as already noted, shows no trace of Encke's division;\r\nbut nine months later the same observer saw it faintly in both ansæ of\r\nthe ring. The conclusion from this and many similar observations seems\r\nto be that the marking is variable, as may very well be, from the\r\nconstitution of the ring. The Crape Ring is beyond any instrument\r\nof less than four inches, and even with such an aperture requires\r\nfavourable circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.\r\n\r\nSATURN, 3-7/8-inch.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to a great number of very remarkable details which of\r\nlate years have been seen and drawn by various observers, it may be\r\nremarked that the student need not be unduly disappointed should his\r\nsmall instrument fail, as it almost certainly will, to show these.\r\nThis is a defect which his telescope shares with an instrument of such\r\nrespectable size and undoubted optical quality as the Lick 36-inch.\r\nWriting in January, 1895, concerning the beautiful drawing which\r\naccompanies this chapter, Professor Barnard somewhat caustically\r\nobserves: 'The black and white spots lately seen upon Saturn by\r\nvarious little telescopes were totally beyond the reach of the\r\n36-inch--as well as of the 12-inch--under either good or bad\r\nconditions of seeing.... The inner edge (of the Crape Ring) was a\r\nuniform curve; the serrated or saw-toothed appearance of its inner\r\nedge which had previously been seen with some small telescopes\r\nwas also beyond the reach of the 36-inch.' Such remarks should be\r\nconsoling to those who find themselves and their instruments unequal\r\nto the remarkable feats which are sometimes accomplished, or recorded.\r\n\r\nSo far as one's personal experience goes, Saturn is generally the\r\nmost easily defined of all the planets. Of late years he has been very\r\nbadly placed for observers in the Northern Hemisphere, and this has\r\nconsiderably interfered with definition. But when well placed the\r\nplanet presents a sharpness and steadiness of outline which render\r\nhim capable of bearing higher magnifying powers than Jupiter, and even\r\nthan Mars, though a curious rippling movement will often be noticed\r\npassing along the rings. It can scarcely be said, however, that\r\nthere is much work for small instruments upon Saturn--the seeing\r\nof imaginary details being excluded. Accordingly, in spite of the\r\nundoubted beauty of the ringed planet, Jupiter will on the whole be\r\nfound to be an object of more permanent interest. Yet, viewed merely\r\nas a spectacle, and as an example of extraordinary grace and symmetry,\r\nSaturn must always command attention. The sight of his wonderful\r\nsystem can hardly fail to excite speculation as to its destiny; and\r\nthe question of the permanence of the rings is one that is almost\r\nthrust upon the spectator. With regard to this matter it may be noted\r\nthat, according to Professor G. H. Darwin, the rings represent merely\r\na passing stage in the evolution of the Saturnian system. At present\r\nthey are within the limit proved by Roche, in 1848, to be that within\r\nwhich no secondary body of reasonable size could exist; and thus the\r\ndiscrete character of their constituents is maintained by the strains\r\nof unequal attraction. Professor Darwin believes that in time the\r\ninner particles of the ring will be drawn inwards, and will eventually\r\nfall upon the planet's surface, while the outer ones will disperse\r\noutwards to a point beyond Roche's limit, where they may eventually\r\ncoalesce into a satellite or satellites--a poor compensation for the\r\nloss of appendages so brilliant and unique as the rings.\r\n\r\nSaturn's train of satellites is the most numerous and remarkable in\r\nour system. As already mentioned, Huygens, the discoverer of the true\r\nform of the ring, discovered also the first and brightest satellite,\r\nTitan, which is a body somewhat larger than our own moon, having a\r\ndiameter of 2,720 miles. A few years later came Cassini's discoveries\r\nof four other satellites, beginning in 1671 and ending in 1684. For\r\nmore than 100 years discovery paused there, and it was not until\r\nAugust and September, 1789, that Sir William Herschel added the sixth\r\nand seventh to our knowledge of the Saturnian system.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Bond in America and Lassell in England made independently the\r\ndiscovery of the eighth satellite--another of the coincidences which\r\nmarked the progress of research upon Saturn, and in both of which Bond\r\nwas concerned. Then followed another pause of fifty years broken by\r\nthe discovery, in 1898, by Professor Pickering, of a ninth, whose\r\nexistence was not completely confirmed till 1904. The motion of this\r\nsatellite has proved to be retrograde, unlike that of the earlier\r\ndiscovered members of the family, so that its discovery has introduced\r\nus to a new and abnormal feature of the Saturnian system. The\r\ndiscoverer of Ph[oe]be, as the ninth satellite has been named, has\r\nfollowed up his success by the discovery of a tenth member of Saturn's\r\nretinue, known provisionally as Themis. Accordingly the system, as at\r\npresent known, consists of a triple ring and ten satellites. The last\r\ndiscovered moons are very small bodies, the diameter of Ph[oe]be, for\r\ninstance, being estimated at 150 miles; while its distance from Saturn\r\nis 8,000,000 miles. From the surface of the planet Ph[oe]be would\r\nappear like a star of fifth or sixth magnitude; to observers on our\r\nown earth its magnitude is fifteenth or sixteenth. The ten satellites\r\nhave been named as follows: 1, Titan, discovered by Huygens; 2,\r\nJapetus; 3, Rhea; 4, Dione; 5, Tethys, all discovered by Cassini; 6,\r\nEnceladus; and 7, Mimas, Sir William Herschel; 8, Hyperion, Bond and\r\nLassell; 9, Ph[oe]be; and 10, Themis, W. H. Pickering. Titan, the\r\nlargest satellite, has been found to be considerably denser than\r\nSaturn himself.\r\n\r\nThe most of these little moons are, of course, beyond the power of\r\nsmall glasses; but a 2-inch will show Titan perfectly well. Japetus\r\nalso is not a difficult object, but is much easier at his western than\r\nat his eastern elongation, a fact which probably points to a surface\r\nof unequal reflective power. Rhea, Dione, and Tethys are much more\r\ndifficult. Kitchiner states that a friend of his saw them with\r\n2-7/10-inch aperture, the planet being hidden; but probably his friend\r\nhad been amusing himself at the quaint old gentleman's expense.\r\nNoble concludes that with a first-class 3-inch and under favourable\r\ncircumstances four, or as a bare possibility even five, satellites may\r\nbe seen; and I have repeatedly seen all the five with 3-7/8-inches.\r\nThe only particular advantages of seeing them are the test which they\r\nafford of the instrument used, and the accompanying practice of the\r\neye in picking up minute points of light. There is a considerable\r\ninterest in watching the gradual disappearance of the brilliant disc\r\nof Saturn behind the edge of the field, or of the thick wire which may\r\nbe placed in the eye-piece to hide the planet, and then catching the\r\nsudden flash up of the tiny dots of light which were previously lost\r\nin the glare of the larger body. For purposes of identification,\r\nrecourse must be had to the 'Companion to the Observatory,' which\r\nprints lists of the elongations of the various satellites and a\r\ndiagram of their orbits which renders it an easy matter to identify\r\nany particular satellite seen. Transits are, with the exception\r\nof that of Titan, beyond the powers of such instruments as we are\r\ncontemplating. The shadow of Titan has, however, been seen in transit\r\nwith a telescope of only 2-7/8-inch aperture.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote *: The plane of the rings passes through the earth\r\n    on April 13, and through the sun on July 27, 1907, at\r\n    which periods it is probable that the rings will altogether\r\n    disappear.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nURANUS AND NEPTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been dealing with bodies which, from time immemorial,\r\nhave been known to man as planets. There must have been a period when\r\none by one the various members of our system known to the ancients\r\nwere discriminated from the fixed stars by unknown but patient and\r\nskilful observers; but, from the dawn of historical astronomy, up to\r\nthe night of March 13, 1781, there had been no addition to the number\r\nof those five primary planets the story of whose discovery is lost in\r\nthe mists of antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether any one man, Kepler and Newton being\r\npossible exceptions, has ever done so much for the science of\r\nastronomy as was accomplished by Sir William Herschel. Certainly\r\nno single observer has ever done so much, or, which is almost more\r\nimportant than the actual amount of his achievement, has so completely\r\nrevolutionized methods and ideas in observing.\r\n\r\nA Hanoverian by birth, and a member of the band of the Hanoverian\r\nGuards, Herschel, after tasting the discomforts of war in the shape\r\nof a night spent in a ditch on the field of Hastenbeck, where that\r\negregious general the Duke of Cumberland was beaten by the French,\r\nconcluded that he was not designed by Nature for martial distinction,\r\nand abruptly solved the problem of his immediate destiny by recourse\r\nto the simple and unheroic expedient of desertion. He came to England,\r\ngot employment after a time as organist of the Octagon Chapel at Bath,\r\nand was rapidly rising into notice as a musician, when the force of\r\nhis genius, combined with a discovery which came certainly unsought,\r\nbut was grasped as only a great man can grasp the gifts of Fortune,\r\nagain changed the direction of his life, and gave him to the science\r\nof astronomy.\r\n\r\nHe had for several years employed his spare time in assiduous\r\nobservation; and, finding that opticians' prices were higher than he\r\ncould well afford, had begun to make Newtonian reflectors for\r\nhimself, and had finally succeeded in constructing one of 6-1/2 inches\r\naperture, and of high optical quality. With this instrument, on the\r\nnight of March 13, 1781, he was engaged in the execution of a plan\r\nwhich he had formed of searching the heavens for double stars, with a\r\nview to measuring their distance from the earth by seeing whether the\r\napparent distance of the members of the double from one another varied\r\nin any degree in the course of the earth's journey round the sun. He\r\nwas working through the stars in the constellation Gemini, when his\r\nattention was fixed by one which presented a different appearance from\r\nthe others which had passed his scrutiny.\r\n\r\nIn a good telescope a fixed star shows only a very small disc, which\r\nindeed should be but a point of light; and the finer the instrument\r\nthe smaller the disc. The disc of this object, however, was\r\nunmistakably larger than those of the fixed stars in its\r\nneighbourhood--unmistakably, that is, to an observer of such skill as\r\nHerschel, though those who have seen Uranus under ordinary powers will\r\nfind their respect considerably increased for the skill which at\r\nonce discriminated the tiny greenish disc from that of a fixed star.\r\nSubsequent observation revealed to Herschel that he was right in\r\nsupposing that this body was not a star, for it proved to be in motion\r\nrelatively to the stars among which it was seen. But, in spite of\r\npoetic authority, astronomical discoveries do not happen quite so\r\ndramatically as the sonnet 'On First looking into Chapman's Homer'\r\nsuggests.\r\n\r\n  'Then felt I like some watcher of the skies,\r\n  When a new planet swims into his ken'\r\n\r\nis a noble simile, were it only true to the facts. But new planets\r\ndo not swim around promiscuously in this fashion; and in the case of\r\nUranus, which more nearly realizes the thought of Keats than any other\r\nin the history of astronomy, the 'watcher of the skies' felt probably\r\nmore puzzlement than anything else. Herschel was far from realizing\r\nthat he had found a new planet. When unmistakable evidence was\r\nforthcoming that the newly discovered body was not a fixed star, he\r\nmerely felt confirmed in the first conjecture which had been suggested\r\nby the size of its disc--namely, that he had discovered a new comet;\r\nand it was as a new comet that Uranus was first announced to the\r\nastronomical world.\r\n\r\nIt quickly became evident, however, that the new discovery moved in no\r\ncometary orbit, but in one which marked it out as a regular member\r\nof the solar system. A search was then instituted for earlier\r\nobservations of the planet, and it was found to have been observed\r\nand mistaken for a fixed star on twenty previous occasions! One\r\nastronomer, Lemonnier, had actually observed it no fewer than twelve\r\ntimes, several of them within a few weeks of one another, and, had he\r\nbut reduced and compared his observations, could scarcely have failed\r\nto have anticipated Herschel's discovery. But perhaps an astronomer\r\nwho, like Lemonnier, noted some of his observations on a paper-bag\r\nwhich had formerly contained hair-powder, and whose astronomical\r\npapers have been described as 'the image of Chaos,' scarcely deserved\r\nthe honour of such a discovery!\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that this new addition to our knowledge of the\r\nsolar system had been made by the self-taught astronomer at Bath,\r\nHerschel was summoned to Court by George III., and enabled to devote\r\nhimself entirely to his favourite study by the bestowal of the not\r\nvery magnificent pension of £200 a year, probably the best investment\r\nthat has ever been made in the interests of astronomical science. In\r\ngratitude to the penurious monarch who had bestowed on him this meagre\r\ncompetence, Herschel wished to call his planet the Georgium Sidus--the\r\nGeorgian Star, and this title, shortened in some instances to the\r\nGeorgian, is still to be found in some ancient volumes on astronomy.\r\nThe astronomers of the Continent, however, did not feel in the least\r\ninclined to elevate Farmer George to the skies before his due time,\r\nand for awhile the name of Herschel was given to the new planet, which\r\nstill bears as its symbol the first letter of its discoverer's name\r\nwith a globe attached to the cross-bar [Uranus]. Finally, the name\r\nUrᾰnus ('a' short) prevailed, and has for long been in universal\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nUranus revolves round the sun at a distance from him of about\r\n1,780,000,000 miles, in an orbit which takes eighty-four of our years\r\nto complete. Barnard gives his diameter at 34,900 miles, and if this\r\nmeasure be correct, he is the third largest planet of the system.\r\nOther measures give a somewhat smaller diameter, and place Neptune\r\nabove him in point of size.\r\n\r\nSubsequent observers have been able to see but little more than\r\nHerschel saw upon the diminutive disc to which even so large a body\r\nis reduced at so vast a distance. When near opposition, Uranus can\r\nreadily be seen with the naked eye as a star of about the sixth\r\nmagnitude, and there is no difficulty in picking him up with the\r\nfinder of an ordinary telescope by means of an almanac and a good star\r\nmap, nor in raising a small disc by the application of a moderately\r\nhigh power, say 200 and upwards. (Herschel was using 227 at the time\r\nof his discovery.) But small telescopes do little more than give their\r\nowners the satisfaction of seeing, pretty much as Herschel saw it,\r\nthe object on which his eye was the first to light. Nor have even the\r\nlargest instruments done very much more. Rings, similar to those of\r\nSaturn, were once suspected, but have long since been disposed of,\r\nand most of the observations of spots and belts have been gravely\r\nquestioned. The Lick observers in 1890 and 1891 describe the belts as\r\n'the merest shades on the planet's surface.'\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of Uranus is marked by peculiarities which distinguish\r\nit from that of the other planets. It is crossed by six dark\r\nabsorption-bands, which indicate at all events that the medium\r\nthrough which the sunlight which it reflects to us has passed is of\r\na constitution markedly different from that of our own atmosphere. It\r\nwas at first thought that the spectrum gave evidence of the planet's\r\nself-luminosity; but this has not proved to be the case, though\r\ndoubtless Uranus, like Jupiter and Saturn, is in the condition of\r\na semi-sun. Like the other members of the group of large exterior\r\nplanets, his density is small, being only 1/5 greater than that of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nSix years after his great discovery, Herschel, with the 40-foot\r\ntelescope of 4 feet in aperture which he had now built, discovered two\r\nsatellites, and believed himself to have discovered four more. Later\r\nobservations have shown that, in the case of the four, small stars\r\nnear the planet had been mistaken for satellites. Subsequently two\r\nmore were discovered, one by Lassell, and one by Otto Struve, making\r\nthe number of the Uranian retinue up to four, so far as our present\r\nknowledge goes. These four satellites, known as Ariel, Umbriel,\r\nOberon, and Titania, are distinguished by the fact that their orbits\r\nare almost perpendicular to the plane of the orbit of Uranus, and that\r\nthe motions of all of them are retrograde. Titania and Oberon, the two\r\ndiscovered by Herschel, are the easiest objects; but although they are\r\nsaid to have been seen with a 4·3-inch refractor, this is a feat which\r\nno ordinary observer need hope to emulate. An 8-inch is a more likely\r\ninstrument for such a task, and a 12-inch more likely still;\r\nthe average observer will probably find the latter none too big.\r\nAccordingly, they are quite beyond the range of such observation as we\r\nare contemplating. The rotation period of Uranus is not known.\r\n\r\nIn a few years after the discovery of Uranus, it became apparent that\r\nby no possible ingenuity could his places as determined by present\r\nobservation be satisfactorily combined with those determined by the\r\ntwenty observations available, as already mentioned, from the period\r\nbefore he was recognised as a planet. Either the old observations were\r\nbad, or else the new planet was wandering from the track which it had\r\nformerly followed. It appeared to Bouvard, who was constructing the\r\ntables for the motions of Uranus, the simplest course to reject the\r\nold observations as probably erroneous, and to confine himself to the\r\nmodern ones. Accordingly this course was pursued, and his tables were\r\npublished in 1821, but only for it to be found that in a few years\r\nthey also began to prove unsatisfactory; discrepancies began to appear\r\nand to increase, and it quickly became apparent that an attempt must\r\nbe made to discover the cause of them.\r\n\r\nBouvard himself appears to have believed in the existence of a planet\r\nexterior to Uranus whose attraction was producing these disturbances,\r\nbut he died in 1843 before any progress had been made with the\r\nsolution of the enigma. In 1834 Hussey approached Airy, the Astronomer\r\nRoyal, with the suggestion that he might sweep for the supposed\r\nexterior planet if some mathematician would help him as to the most\r\nlikely region to investigate. Airy, however, returned a sufficiently\r\ndiscouraging answer, and Hussey apparently was deterred by it from\r\ncarrying out a search which might very possibly have been rewarded\r\nby success. Bessel, the great German mathematician, had marked the\r\nproblem for his own, and would doubtless have succeeded in solving\r\nit, but shortly after he had begun the gathering of material for his\r\nresearches, he was seized with the illness which ultimately proved\r\nfatal to him.\r\n\r\nThe question was thus practically untouched when in 1841, John Couch\r\nAdams, then an undergraduate of St. John's College, Cambridge, jotted\r\ndown a memorandum in which he indicated his resolve to attack it and\r\nattempt the discovery of the perturbing planet, 'as soon as possible\r\nafter taking my degree.' The half-sheet of notepaper on which the\r\nmemorandum was made is still extant, and forms part of the volume\r\nof manuscripts on the subject preserved in the library of St. John's\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 1845, Adams, who had taken his degree (Senior Wrangler)\r\nin 1843, communicated to Airy the results of his sixth and final\r\nattempt at the solution of the problem, and furnished him with the\r\nelements and mass of the perturbing planet, and an indication of its\r\napproximate place in the heavens. Airy, whose record in the matter\r\nreads very strangely, was little more inclined to give encouragement\r\nto Adams than to Hussey. He replied by propounding to the young\r\ninvestigator a question which he considered 'a question of vast\r\nimportance, an _experimentum crucis_,' which Adams seemingly\r\nconsidered of so little moment, that strangely enough he never\r\ntroubled to answer it. Then the matter dropped out of sight, though,\r\nhad the planet been sought for when Adams's results were first\r\ncommunicated to the Astronomer Royal, it would have been found within\r\n3-1/2 lunar diameters of the place assigned to it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in France, another and better-known mathematician had taken\r\nup the subject, and in three memoirs presented to the French Academy\r\nof Sciences in 1846, Leverrier furnished data concerning the new\r\nplanet which agreed in very remarkable fashion with those furnished by\r\nAdams to Airy. The coincidence shook Airy's scepticism, and he asked\r\nDr. Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory, to begin a search\r\nfor the planet with the large Northumberland equatorial. Challis, who\r\nhad no complete charts of the region to be searched, began to make\r\nobservations for the construction of a chart which would enable him to\r\ndetect the planet by means of its motion. It is more than likely that\r\nhad he adopted Hussey's suggestion of simply sweeping in the vicinity\r\nof the spot indicated, he would have been successful, for the\r\nNorthumberland telescope was of 11 inches aperture, and would have\r\nborne powers sufficient to distinguish readily the disc of Neptune\r\nfrom the fixed stars around it. However, Challis chose the more\r\nthorough, but longer method of charting; and even to that he did\r\nnot devote undivided attention. 'Some wretched comet,' says Proctor,\r\n'which he thought it his more important duty to watch, prevented\r\nhim from making the reductions which would have shown him that the\r\nexterior planet had twice been recorded in his notes of observations.'\r\n\r\nIndeed, a certain fatality seems to have hung over the attempts made\r\nin Britain to realize Adams's discovery. In 1845, the Rev. W. R.\r\nDawes, one of the keenest and most skilful of amateur observers, was\r\nso much impressed by some of Adams's letters to the Astronomer Royal\r\nthat he wrote to Lassell, asking him to search for the planet. When\r\nDawes's letter arrived, Lassell was suffering from a sprained ankle,\r\nand laid the letter aside till he should be able to resume work. In\r\nthe meantime the letter was burned by an officious servant-maid, and\r\nLassell lost the opportunity of a discovery which would have crowned\r\nthe fine work which he accomplished as an amateur observer.\r\n\r\nA very different fate had attended Leverrier's calculations. On\r\nSeptember 23, 1846, a letter from Leverrier was received at the Berlin\r\nObservatory, asking that search should be made for the planet in the\r\nposition which his inquiries had pointed out. The same night Galle\r\nmade the search, and within a degree of the spot indicated an object\r\nwas found with a measurable disc of between two and three seconds\r\ndiameter. As it was not laid down on Bremiker's star-chart of the\r\nregion, it was clearly not a star, and by next night its planetary\r\nnature was made manifest. The promptitude with which Leverrier's\r\nresults were acted upon by Encke and Galle is in strong contrast to\r\nthe sluggishness which characterized the British official astronomers,\r\nwho, indeed, can scarcely be said to have come out of the business\r\nwith much credit.\r\n\r\nA somewhat undignified controversy ensued. The French astronomers,\r\nvery naturally, were eager to claim all the laurels for their\r\nbrilliant countryman, and were indignant when a claim was put in on\r\nbehalf of a young Englishman whose name had never previously been\r\nheard of. Airy, however, displayed more vigour in this petty squabble\r\nthan in the search for Neptune, and presented such evidence in support\r\nof his fellow-countryman's right to recognition that it was impossible\r\nto deny him the honour which, but for official slackness, would have\r\nfallen to him as the actual as well as the potential discoverer of the\r\nnew planet. Adams himself took no part in the strife; spoke, indeed,\r\nno words on the matter, except to praise the abilities of Leverrier,\r\nand gave no sign of the annoyance which most men in like circumstances\r\nwould have displayed.\r\n\r\nGalle suggested that the new planet should be called Janus; but the\r\nname of the two-faced god was felt to be rather too pointedly suitable\r\nat the moment, and that of Neptune was finally preferred. Neptune\r\nis about 32,900 miles in diameter, his distance from the sun is\r\n2,792,000,000 miles, and he occupies 165 years in the circuit of his\r\ngigantic orbit. The spectroscopic evidence, such as it is, seems to\r\npoint to a condition somewhat similar to that of Uranus.\r\n\r\nNeptune had only been discovered seventeen days when Lassell found him\r\nto be attended by one satellite. First seen on October 10, 1846, it\r\nwas not till the following July that the existence of this body\r\nwas verified by Lassell himself and also by Otto Struve and Bond\r\nof Harvard. From the fact that it is visible at such an enormous\r\ndistance, it is evident that this satellite must be of considerable\r\nsize--probably at least equal to our own moon.\r\n\r\nSmall instruments can make nothing of Neptune beyond, perhaps,\r\ndistinguishing the fact that, whatever the tiny disc may be, it is\r\nnot that of a star. His satellite is an object reserved for the very\r\nfinest instruments alone.\r\n\r\nShould Neptune have any inhabitants, their sky must be somewhat barren\r\nof planets. Jupiter's greatest elongation from the sun would be about\r\n10°, and he would be seen under somewhat less favourable conditions\r\nthan those under which we see Mercury; while the planets between\r\nJupiter and the sun would be perpetually invisible. Saturn and Uranus,\r\nhowever, would be fairly conspicuous, the latter being better seen\r\nthan from the earth.\r\n\r\nSuspicions have been entertained of the existence of another planet\r\nbeyond Neptune, and photographic searches have been made, but hitherto\r\nwithout success. So far as our present knowledge goes, Neptune is the\r\nutmost sentinel of the regular army of the solar system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCOMETS AND METEORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one type of celestial object which seldom fails to stir up\r\nthe mind of even the most sluggishly unastronomical member of the\r\ncommunity and to inspire him with an interest in the science--an\r\ninterest which is usually conspicuous for a picturesque inaccuracy\r\nin the details which it accumulates, for a pathetic faith in the most\r\nextraordinary fibs which may be told in the name of science, and for\r\na subsidence which is as rapid as the changes in the object which gave\r\nthe inspiration. The sun may go on shining, a perpetual mystery and\r\nmiracle, without attracting any attention, save when a wet spring\r\nbrings on the usual talk of sun-spots and the weather; Jupiter\r\nand Venus excite only sufficient interest to suggest an occasional\r\nquestion as to whether that bright star is the Star of Bethlehem; but\r\nwhen a great comet spreads its fiery tail across the skies everybody\r\nturns astronomer for the nonce, and normally slumber-loving people\r\nare found willing, or at least able, to desert their beds at the\r\nmost unholy hours to catch a glimpse of the strange and mysterious\r\nvisitant. And, when the comet eventually withdraws from view again, as\r\nmuch inaccurate information has been disseminated among the public as\r\nwould fill an encyclopædia, and require another to correct.\r\n\r\nComets are, however, really among the most interesting of celestial\r\nobjects. Though we no longer imagine them to foretell wars, famines,\r\nand plagues, or complacently to indicate the approbation of heaven\r\nupon some illustrious person deceased or about to decease, and have\r\nalmost ceased to shiver at the possibilities of a collision between a\r\ncomet and the earth, they have within the last half century taken on a\r\nnew and growing interest of a more legitimate kind, and there are few\r\ndepartments of science in which the advance of knowledge has been more\r\nrapid or which promise more in the immediate future, given material to\r\nwork upon.\r\n\r\nThe popular idea of a comet is that it is a kind of bright wandering\r\nstar with a long tail. Indeed, the star part of the conception is\r\nquite subsidiary to the tail part. The tail is _the_ thing, and a\r\ncomet without a tail is not worthy of attention, if it is not rather\r\nguilty of claiming notice on false pretences. As a matter of fact, the\r\ntail is absent in many comets and quite inconspicuous in many more;\r\nand a comet may be a body with any degree of resemblance or want of\r\nresemblance to the popular idea, from the faint globular stain of\r\nhaze, scarcely perceptible in the telescopic field against the dark\r\nbackground of the sky, up to a magnificent object, which, like the\r\ndragon in the Revelation, seems to draw the third part of the stars\r\nof heaven after it--an object like the Donati comet of 1858, with a\r\nnucleus brighter than a first-magnitude star, and a tail like a great\r\nfeathery plume of light fifty millions of miles in length. It seems\r\nas impossible to set limits to the variety of form of which comets are\r\ncapable as it is to set limits to their number.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, however, a comet consists of three parts: The\r\nnucleus--which appears as a more or less clearly defined star-like\r\npoint, and is the only part of the comet which will bear any\r\nmagnification to speak of--the coma, and the tail. In many telescopic\r\ncomets the nucleus is entirely absent, and, in the comets in which\r\nit is present, it is of very varied size, and often presents curious\r\nirregularities in shape, and even occasionally the appearance of\r\ninternal motions. It frequently changes very much in size during the\r\nperiod of the comet's visibility. The nucleus is the only part of a\r\ncomet's structure which has even the most distant claim to solidity;\r\nbut even so the evidence which has been gradually accumulated all goes\r\nto show that while it may be solid in the sense of being composed of\r\nparticles which have some substance, it is not solid in the sense of\r\nbeing one coherent mass, but rather consists of something like a swarm\r\nof small meteoric bodies. Surrounding the nucleus is the coma, from\r\nwhich the comet derives its name. This is a sort of misty cloud\r\nthrough which the nucleus seems to shine like a star in a nebula or\r\na gas-lamp in a fog. Its boundaries are difficult to trace, as it\r\nappears to fade away gradually on every side into the background; but\r\ngenerally its appearance is more or less of a globular shape except\r\nwhere the tail streams away from it behind. Sometimes the coma is of\r\nenormous extent--the Great Comet of 1811 showed a nucleus of 428 miles\r\ndiameter, enclosed within a nebulous globe 127,000 miles across, which\r\nin its turn was wrapped in a luminous atmosphere of four times\r\ngreater diameter, with an outside envelope covering all, and extending\r\nbackwards to form the tail. But it is also of the most extraordinary\r\ntenuity, the light of the very faintest stars having been frequently\r\nobserved to shine undimmed through several millions of miles of coma.\r\nFinally, there is the tail, which may be so short as to be barely\r\ndistinguishable; or may extend, as in the case of Comet 1811 (ii.), to\r\n130,000,000 miles; or, as in that of Comet 1843 (i.), to 200,000,000.\r\nThe most tenuous substances with which we are acquainted seem to be\r\nsolidity itself compared with the material of a comet's tail. It is\r\n'such stuff as dreams are made of.'\r\n\r\nComets fall into two classes. There are those whose orbits follow\r\ncurves that are not closed, like the circle or the ellipse, but appear\r\nto extend indefinitely into space. A comet following such an orbit\r\n(parabolic or hyperbolic) seems to come wandering in from the depths\r\nof space, passes round the sun, and then gradually recedes into the\r\nspace from which it came, never again to be seen of human eye. It is\r\nnow becoming questionable, however, whether any comet can really\r\nbe said to come in from infinite space; and the view is being more\r\ngenerally held that orbits which to us appear portions of unclosed\r\ncurves may in reality be only portions of immensely elongated\r\nellipses, and that all comets are really members of the solar system,\r\ntravelling away, indeed, to distances that are immense compared with\r\neven the largest planetary orbit, but yet infinitely small compared\r\nwith the distances of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nSecond, there are those comets whose orbits form ellipses with a\r\ngreater or less departure from the circular form. Such comets must\r\nalways return again, sooner or later, to the neighbourhood of the sun,\r\nwhich occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and they are known as\r\nPeriodic Comets. The orbits which they follow may have any degree of\r\ndeparture from the circular form, from one which does not differ very\r\nnotably from that of such a planet as Eros, up to one which may be\r\nscarcely distinguishable from a parabola. Thus we have Periodic Comets\r\nagain divided into comets of short and comets of long period. In the\r\nformer class, the period ranges from that of Encke's comet which never\r\ntravels beyond the orbit of Jupiter, and only takes 3·29 years to\r\ncomplete its journey, up to that of the famous comet whose periodicity\r\nwas first discovered by Halley, whose extreme distance from the sun\r\nis upwards of 3,200,000,000 miles, and whose period is 76·78 years.\r\nComets of long period range from bodies which only require a paltry\r\ntwo or three centuries to complete their revolution, up to others\r\nwhose journey has to be timed by thousands of years. In the case of\r\nthese latter bodies, there is scarcely any distinction to be made\r\nbetween them and those comets which are not supposed to be periodic;\r\nthe ellipse of a comet which takes three or four thousand years to\r\ncomplete its orbit is scarcely to be distinguished, in the small\r\nportion of it that can be traced, from a parabola.\r\n\r\nSeveral comets have been found to be short period bodies, which,\r\nthough bright enough to have been easily seen, have yet never been\r\nnoticed at any previous appearance. It is known that some at least of\r\nthese owe their present orbits to the fact that having come near to\r\none or other of the planets they have been, so to speak, captured, and\r\ndiverted from the track which they formerly pursued. Several of the\r\nplanets have more or less numerous flocks of comets associated with\r\nthem which they have thus captured and introduced into a short period\r\ncareer. Jupiter has more than a score in his group, while Saturn,\r\nUranus and Neptune have smaller retinues. There can be no question\r\nthat a comet of first-class splendour, such as that of 1811, that of\r\n1858, or that of 1861, is one of the most impressive spectacles that\r\nthe heavens have to offer. Unfortunately it is one which the present\r\ngeneration, at least in the northern hemisphere, has had but little\r\nopportunity of witnessing. Chambers notices 'that it may be taken as\r\na fact that a bright and conspicuous comet comes about once in ten\r\nyears, and a very remarkable comet once every thirty years;' and adds,\r\n'tested then by either standard of words \"bright and conspicuous,\" or\r\n\"specially celebrated,\" it may be affirmed that a good comet is now\r\ndue.' It is eleven years since that hopeful anticipation was penned,\r\nand we are still waiting, not only for the 'specially celebrated,' but\r\neven for the 'bright and conspicuous' comet; so that on the whole we\r\nmay be said to have a grievance. Still, there is no saying when the\r\ngrievance may be removed, as comets have a knack of being unexpected\r\nin their developments; and it may be that some unconsidered little\r\npatch of haze is even now drawing in from the depths which may yet\r\ndevelop into a portent as wonderful as those that astonished the\r\ngeneration before us in 1858 and 1861.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of comets is, in all probability, enormous. Between\r\nthe beginning of the Christian era and 1888 the number recorded was,\r\naccording to Chambers, 850; but the real number for that period must\r\nhave been indefinitely greater, as, for upwards of 1600 out of the\r\n1888 years, only those comets which were visible to the naked eye\r\ncould have been recorded--a very small proportion of the whole. The\r\nperiod 1801 to 1888 shows 270, so that in less than one century\r\nthere has been recorded almost one-third of the total for nineteen\r\ncenturies. At present no year goes by without the discovery of several\r\ncomets; but very few of them become at all conspicuous. For example,\r\nin 1904, six comets were seen--three of these being returns of comets\r\npreviously observed, and three new discoveries; but none of these\r\nproved at all notable objects in the ordinary sense, though Comet 1904\r\n(_a_), discovered by Brooks, was pretty generally observed.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no useful purpose to repeat here the stories of any of\r\nthe great comets. These may be found in considerable detail in such\r\nvolumes as Chambers's 'Handbook of Astronomy,' vol. i., or Miss Agnes\r\nClerke's 'History of Astronomy.' Attention must rather be turned to\r\nthe question, 'What are comets?' It is a question to which no answer\r\nof a satisfactory character could be given till within the last fifty\r\nyears. Even the great comet of 1858, the Donati, which made so deep an\r\nimpression on the public mind, and was so closely followed and\r\nstudied by astronomers, was not the medium of any great advance in\r\nthe knowledge of cometary nature. The many memoirs which it elicited\r\ndisclosed nothing fundamentally new, and broke out no new lines of\r\ninquiry. Two things have since then revolutionized the study of the\r\nsubject--the application of the spectroscope to the various comets\r\nthat have appeared in the closing years of the nineteenth century, and\r\nthe discovery of the intimate connection between comets and meteors.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1864, a year further made memorable astronomically by Sir\r\nWilliam Huggins's discovery of the gaseous nature of some of the\r\nnebulæ, that the spectroscope was first applied to the study of\r\na comet. The celestial visitor thus put to the question, a comet\r\ndiscovered by Tempel, was in nowise a distinguished object, appearing\r\nlike a star of the second magnitude, or less, with a feeble though\r\nfairly long tail. When analyzed by Donati, it was found to yield a\r\nspectrum consisting of three bright bands, yellow, green, and blue,\r\nseparated by dark spaces. This observation at once modified ideas as\r\nto cometary structure. Hitherto it had been supposed that comets shone\r\nby reflected light; but Donati's observation revealed beyond question\r\nthat the light of the 1864 comet at all events was inherent, and that,\r\nso far as the observation went, the comet consisted of glowing gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXV.\r\n\r\nGreat Comet. Photographed May 5, 1901, with the 13-inch Astrographic\r\nRefractor of the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope.]\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Sir William Huggins carried the matter one step further by\r\nshowing that the spectrum of Winnecke's comet of that year agreed\r\nwith that of olefiant gas rendered luminous by electricity; and the\r\npresence of the hydrocarbon spectrum has since been detected in\r\na large number of comets. The first really brilliant comet to be\r\nanalyzed by the spectroscope was Coggia's (1874), and it presented not\r\nonly the three bright bands that had been already seen, but the whole\r\nrange of five bands characteristic of the hydrocarbon spectrum. In\r\ncertain cases, however--notably, that of Holmes's comet of 1892 and\r\nthat of the great southern comet of 1901 (Plate XXV.)--the spectrum\r\nhas not exhibited the usual bright band type, but has instead shown\r\nmerely a continuous ribbon of colour. From these analyses certain\r\nfacts emerge. First, that the gaseous surroundings of comets consist\r\nmainly of hydrogen and carbon, and that in all probability their\r\nluminosity is due, not to mere solar heat, but to the effect of some\r\nelectric process acting upon them during their approach to the sun;\r\nand second, that, along with these indications of the presence\r\nof luminous hydrocarbon compounds, there is also evidence of the\r\nexistence of solid particles, mainly in the nucleus, but also to some\r\nextent in the rest of the comet, which shine by reflected sunlight. It\r\nis further almost certain, from the observation by Elkin and Finlay\r\nof the beginning of the transit of Comet 1882 (iii.) across the sun's\r\nface, that this solid matter is not in any sense a solid mass. The\r\ncomet referred to disappeared absolutely as soon as it began to pass\r\nthe sun's edge. Had it been a solid mass or even a closely compacted\r\ncollection of small bodies it would have appeared as a black spot upon\r\nthe solar surface. The conclusion, then, is obvious that the solid\r\nmatter must be very thinly and widely spread, while its individual\r\nparticles may have any size from that of grains of sand up to that of\r\nthe large meteoric bodies which sometimes reach our earth.\r\n\r\nThus the state of the case as regards the constitution of comets is,\r\nroughly speaking, this: They consist of a nucleus of solid\r\nmatter, held together, but with a very slack bond, by the power of\r\ngravitation. From this nucleus, as the comet approaches perihelion,\r\nthe electric action of the sun, working in a manner at present\r\nunknown, drives off volumes of luminous gas, which form the tail; and\r\nin some comets the waves of this vapour have been actually seen rising\r\nslowly in successive pulses from the nucleus, and then being driven\r\nbackwards much as the smoke of a steamer is driven. It has been found\r\nalso by investigation of Comet Wells 1882 and the Great Comet of 1882\r\nthat in some at least of these bodies sodium and iron are present.\r\n\r\nThe question next arises, What becomes of comets in the end? Kepler\r\nlong ago asserted his belief that they perished, as silkworms perish\r\nby spinning their own thread, exhausting themselves by the very\r\nefforts of tail-production which render them sometimes so brilliant to\r\nobservation; and this seems to be pretty much the case. Thus Halley's\r\ncomet, which was once so brilliant and excited so much attention,\r\nwas at its last visit a very inconspicuous object indeed. At its\r\napparition in 1845-1846 Biela's comet was found to have split into\r\ntwo separate bodies, which were found at their return in 1852 to have\r\nparted company widely. Since that year it has never been observed\r\nagain in the form of a comet, though, as we shall see, it has\r\npresented itself in a different guise. The same fate has overtaken the\r\ncomets of De Vico (1844), and Brorsen (1846). The former should have\r\nreturned in 1850, but failed to keep its appointment; and the latter,\r\nafter having established a character for regularity by returning to\r\nobservation on four occasions, failed to appear in 1890, and has never\r\nsince been seen.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of such disappearances has been at least partially\r\ndispelled by the discovery, due to Schiaparelli and other workers in\r\nthe same field, that various prominent meteor-showers travel in orbits\r\nprecisely the same as those of certain comets. Thus the shower of\r\nmeteors which takes place with greater or less brilliancy every year\r\nfrom a point in the constellation Perseus has been proved to follow\r\nthe orbit of the bright comet of 1862; while the great periodic shower\r\nof the Leonids follows the track of the comet of 1866; the orbit of\r\nthe star-shower of April 20--the Lyrids--corresponds with that of a\r\ncomet seen in 1861; and the disappearance of Biela's comet appears to\r\nbe accounted for by the other November shower whose radiant point is\r\nin the constellation Andromeda. In fact, the state of the matter is\r\nwell summed up by Kirkwood's question: 'May not our periodic meteors\r\nbe the débris of ancient but now disintegrated comets, whose matter\r\nhas become distributed round their orbits?' The loosely compacted mass\r\nwhich forms the nucleus of the comet appears to gradually lose its\r\ncohesion under the force of solar tidal action, and its fragments\r\ncome to revolve independently in their orbit, for a time in a loosely\r\ngathered swarm, and then gradually, as the laggards drop behind, in\r\nthe form of a complete ring of meteoric bodies, which are distributed\r\nover the whole orbit. The Leonid shower is in the first condition, or,\r\nrather, was when it was last seen, for it seems to be now lost to us;\r\nthe Perseid shower is in the second. The shower of the Andromedes has\r\nsince confirmed its identity with the lost comet of Biela by displays\r\nin 1872, 1885, and 1892, at the seasons when that comet should\r\nhave returned to the neighbourhood of the sun. It appears to be\r\nexperiencing the usual fate of such showers, and becoming more\r\nwidely distributed round its orbit, and the return in 1905 was very\r\ndisappointing, the reason apparently being that the dense group in\r\nclose attendance on the comet has suffered disturbance from Jupiter\r\nand Saturn, and now passes more than a million miles outside the\r\nearth's orbit.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 there appeared one of the most remarkable of recorded comets.\r\nIt was not only of conspicuous brilliancy and size, though its tail\r\nat one stage reached the enormous length of 200,000,000 miles, but was\r\nremarkable for the extraordinarily close approach which it made to the\r\nsun. Its centre came as near to the sun as 78,000 miles, leaving no\r\nmore than 32,000 miles between the surfaces of the two bodies; it\r\nmust, therefore, have passed clear through the corona, and very\r\nprobably through some of the prominences. Its enormous tail was\r\nwhirled, or rather appeared to be whirled, right round the sun in a\r\nlittle over two hours, thus affording conclusive proof that the\r\ntail of a comet cannot possibly be an appendage, but must consist of\r\nperpetually renewed emanations from the nucleus. But in addition to\r\nthese wonders, the comet of 1843 proved the precursor of a series of\r\nfine comets travelling in orbits which were practically identical. The\r\ngreat southern comet of 1880 proved, when its orbit had been computed,\r\nto follow a path almost exactly the same as that of its predecessor\r\nof thirty-seven years before. It seemed inconceivable that a body so\r\nremarkable as the 1843 comet should have a period of only thirty-seven\r\nyears, and yet never previously have attracted attention. Before\r\nthe question had been fairly discussed, it was accentuated by\r\nthe discovery, in 1881, of a comet whose orbit was almost\r\nindistinguishable from that of the comet of 1807. But the 1807 comet\r\nwas not due to return till A.D. 3346. Further, the comet of 1881\r\nproved to have a period, not of seventy-four years, as would have been\r\nthe case had it been a return of that of 1807, but of 2,429 years.\r\nThe only possible conclusion was that here were two comets which were\r\nreally fragments of one great comet which had suffered disruption,\r\nas Biela's comet visibly did, and that one fragment followed in the\r\nother's wake with an interval of seventy-four years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the question of the 1843 and 1880 comets was still\r\nunsettled, and it received a fresh complication by the appearance\r\nof the remarkable comet of 1882, whose transit of the sun has been\r\nalready alluded to, for the orbit of this new body proved to be a\r\nreproduction, almost, but not quite exact, of those of the previous\r\ntwo. Astronomers were at a greater loss than ever, for if this were a\r\nreturn of the 1880 comet, then the conclusion followed that something\r\nwas so influencing its orbit as to have shortened its period from\r\nthirty-seven to two years. The idea of the existence of some medium\r\nround the sun, capable of resisting bodies which passed through it,\r\nand thus causing them to draw closer to their centre of attraction and\r\nshortening their periods, was now revived, and it seemed as though,\r\nat its next return, this wonderful visitant must make the final plunge\r\ninto the photosphere, with what consequences none could foretell.\r\nThese forebodings proved to be quite baseless. The comet passed so\r\nclose to the sun (within 300,000 miles of his surface), that it must\r\nhave been sensibly retarded at its passage by the resisting medium,\r\nhad such a thing existed; but not the slightest retardation was\r\ndiscernible. The comet suffered no check in its plunge through the\r\nsolar surroundings, and consequently the theory of the resisting\r\nmedium may be said to have received its quietus.\r\n\r\nComputation showed that the 1882 comet followed nearly the same orbit\r\nas its predecessors; and thus we are faced by the fact of families\r\nof comets, travelling in orbits that are practically identical, and\r\nsucceeding one another at longer or shorter intervals. The idea that\r\nthese families have each sprung from the disruption of some much\r\nlarger body seems to be most probable, and it appears to be confirmed\r\nby the fact that in the 1882 comet the process of further disruption\r\nwas actually witnessed. Schmidt of Athens detected one small offshoot\r\nof the great comet, which remained visible for several days. Barnard\r\na few days later saw at least six small nebulous bodies close to their\r\nparent, and a little later Brooks observed another. 'Thus,' as Miss\r\nAgnes Clerke remarks, 'space appeared to be strewn with the filmy\r\ndébris of this beautiful but fragile structure all along the track of\r\nits retreat from the sun.'\r\n\r\nThe state of our knowledge with regard to comets may be roughly summed\r\nup. We have extreme tenuity in the whole body, even the nucleus\r\nbeing apparently not solid, but a comparatively loose swarm of\r\nsolid particles. The nucleus, in all likelihood, shines by reflected\r\nsunlight--in part, at all events. The nebulous surroundings and tail\r\nare produced by solar action upon the matter of which the comet is\r\ncomposed, this action being almost certainly electrical, though heat\r\nmay play some part in it. The nebulous matter appears to proceed in\r\nwaves from the nucleus, and to be swept backward along the comet's\r\ntrack by some repellent force, probably electrical, exerted by\r\nthe sun. This part of the comet's structure consists mainly of\r\nself-luminous gases, generally of the hydrocarbon type, though sodium\r\nand iron have also been traced. Comets, certainly in many cases,\r\nprobably in all, suffer gradual degradation into swarms of meteors.\r\nThe existence of groups of comets, each group probably the outcome of\r\nthe disruption of a much larger body, is demonstrated by the fact of\r\nsuccessive comets travelling in almost identically similar orbits.\r\nFinally, comets are all connected with the solar system, so far, at\r\nleast, that they accompany that system in its journey of 400,000,000\r\nmiles a year through space. Our system does not, as it were, pick up\r\nthe comets as it sweeps along upon its great journey; it carries them\r\nalong with it.\r\n\r\nA few words may be added as to cometary observation. It is scarcely\r\nlikely that any very great number of amateur observers will ever\r\nbe attracted by the branch of comet-hunting. The work is somewhat\r\nmonotonous and laborious, and seems to require special aptitudes,\r\nand, above all, an enormous endowment of patience. Probably the true\r\ncomet-hunter, like the poet, is born, not made; and it is not likely\r\nthat there are, nor desirable that there should be, many individuals\r\nof the type of Messier, the 'comet-ferret.' 'Messier,' writes a\r\ncontemporary, 'is at all events a very good man, and simple as a\r\nchild. He lost his wife some years ago, and his attendance upon her\r\ndeath-bed prevented his being the discoverer of a comet for which he\r\nhad been lying in wait, and which was snatched from him by Montaigne\r\nde Limoges. This made him desperate. A visitor began to offer him\r\nconsolation for his recent bereavement, when Messier, thinking only of\r\nthe comet, answered, \"I had discovered twelve; alas! to be robbed of\r\nthe thirteenth by that Montaigne!\" and his eyes filled with tears.\r\nThen, recollecting that it was necessary to deplore his wife, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Ah! cette pauvre femme!\" and again wept for his comet.' In\r\naddition to the fact that few have reached such a degree of scientific\r\ndetachment as to put a higher value upon a comet than upon the nearest\r\nof relatives, there is the further fact that the future of cometary\r\ndiscovery, and of the record of cometary change seems to lie almost\r\nentirely with photography, which is wonderfully adapted for the work\r\n(Plate XXVI.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVI.\r\n\r\n  1      2\r\n\r\nPhotographs of Swift's Comet. By Professor E. E. Barnard.\r\n\r\n1. Taken April 4, 1892; exposure 1 hour. 2. Taken April 6, 1892;\r\nexposure 1 hour 5 minutes.]\r\n\r\nAnyone who desires to become a comet-hunter must, in addition to\r\nthe possession of the supreme requisites, patience and perseverance,\r\nprovide himself with an instrument of at least 4 inches aperture,\r\ntogether with a good and comprehensive set of star-charts and the New\r\nGeneral Catalogue of nebulæ with the additions which have been made to\r\nit. The reason for this latter item of equipment is the fact that many\r\ntelescopic comets are scarcely to be distinguished from nebulæ, and\r\nthat an accurate knowledge of the nebulous objects in the regions to\r\nbe searched for comets, or at least a means of quickly identifying\r\nsuch objects, is therefore indispensable. The portions of the heavens\r\nwhich afford the most likely fields for discovery will naturally be\r\nthose in the vicinity of where the sun has set at evening, or where he\r\nis about to rise in the early morning, all comets having of necessity\r\nto approach the sun more or less closely at their perihelion passage.\r\nOther parts of the heavens should not be neglected; but these are the\r\nmost likely neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nMost of us, however, will be content to discover our comets in the\r\ncolumns of the daily newspaper, or by means of a post-card from\r\nsome obliging friend. The intimation, in whatever way received, will\r\ngenerally contain the position of the comet at a certain date, given\r\nin right ascension and declination, and either a statement of its\r\napparent daily motion, or else a provisional set of places for several\r\ndays ahead. Having either of these, the comet's position must be\r\nmarked down on the star-map, and the course which it is likely to\r\npursue must be traced out in pencil by means of the data--a perfectly\r\nsimple matter of marking down the position for each day by its\r\ncelestial longitude and latitude as given. The observer will next note\r\ncarefully the alignment of the comet with the most conspicuous stars\r\nin the neighbourhood of the particular position for the day of his\r\nobservation; and, guiding his telescope by means of these, will point\r\nit as nearly as possible to that position. He may be lucky enough\r\nto hit upon his object at once, especially if it be a comparatively\r\nbright one. More probably, he will have to 'sweep' for it. In this\r\ncase the telescope must be pointed some little distance below and to\r\none side of the probable position of the comet, and moved slowly and\r\ngently along, careful watch being kept upon the objects which pass\r\nthrough the field, until a similar distance on the opposite side of\r\nthe position has been reached. Then raise the instrument by not more\r\nthan half a field's breadth, estimating this by the stars in the\r\nfield, and repeat the process in the opposite direction, going on\r\nuntil the comet appears in the field, or until it is obvious that it\r\nhas been missed. A low power should be used at first, which may be\r\nchanged for a somewhat higher one when the object has been found. But\r\nin no case will the use of really high magnifiers be found advisable.\r\nIt is, of course, simply impossible with the tail, for which the\r\nnaked eye is the best instrument, nor can the coma bear any degree\r\nof magnification, though occasionally the nucleus may be sufficiently\r\nsharply defined to bear moderate powers. The structure of the latter\r\nshould be carefully observed, with particular attention to the\r\nquestion of whether any change can be seen in it, or whether there\r\nseem any tendency to such a multiplication of nuclei as characterized\r\nthe great comet of 1882. It is possible that the pulses of vapour\r\nsunwards from the nucleus may also be observed.\r\n\r\nAppearance of motion, wavy or otherwise, in the tail, should also be\r\nlooked for, and carefully watched if seen. Beyond this there is not\r\nvery much that the ordinary observer can do; the determination of\r\npositions requires more elaborate appliances, and the spectroscope is\r\nnecessary for any study of cometary constitution. It only remains\r\nto express a wish for the speedy advent of a worthy subject for\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe turn now to those bodies which, as has been pointed out, appear to\r\nbe the débris of comets which have exhausted their cometary destiny,\r\nand ceased to have a corporate existence. Everyone is familiar with\r\nthe phenomenon known as a meteor, or shooting-star, and there are few\r\nclear nights on which an observer who is much in the open will not see\r\none or more of these bodies. Generally they become visible in the form\r\nof a bright point of light which traverses in a straight line a longer\r\nor shorter path across the heavens, and then vanishes, sometimes\r\nleaving behind it for a second or two a faintly luminous train. The\r\nshooting-stars are of all degrees of brightness, from the extremely\r\nfaint streaks which sometimes flash across the field of the telescope,\r\nup to brilliant objects, brighter than any of the planets or fixed\r\nstars, and sometimes lighting up the whole landscape with a light like\r\nthat of the full moon.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing opinion, down to a comparatively late date, was that\r\nshooting-stars were mere exhalations in the earth's atmosphere,\r\narising as one author expressed it, 'from the fermentation of acid\r\nand alkaline bodies, which float in the atmosphere'; and it was\r\nalso suggested by eminent astronomers that they were the products\r\nof terrestrial volcanoes, returning, after long wanderings, to their\r\nnative home.\r\n\r\nThe true study of meteoric astronomy may be said to date from the year\r\n1833, when a shower of most extraordinary splendour was witnessed.\r\nThe magnificence of this display was the means of turning greater\r\nattention to the subject; and it was observed as a fact, though the\r\nimportance of the observation was scarcely realized, that the meteors\r\nall appeared to come from nearly the one point in the constellation\r\nLeo. The fact of there being a single radiant point implied that\r\nthe meteors were all moving in parallel lines, and had entered\r\nour atmosphere from a vast distance. Humboldt, who had witnessed a\r\nprevious appearance of this shower in 1799, suggested that it might be\r\na periodic phenomenon; and his suggestion was amply confirmed when\r\nin 1866 the shower made its appearance again in scarcely diminished\r\nsplendour. Gradually other showers came to be recognised, and their\r\nradiant points fixed; and meteoric astronomy began to be established\r\nupon a scientific basis.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Schiaparelli announced that the shower which radiates in\r\nAugust from the constellation Perseus follows the same track as that\r\nof Swift's comet (1862 iii.); and in the following year the great\r\nNovember shower from Leo, already alluded to, was proved to have a\r\nsimilar connection with Tempel's comet (1866 i.). The shower which\r\ncomes from the constellation Lyra, about April 20, describes the\r\nsame orbit as that of Comet 1861 i.; while, as already mentioned,\r\nthe mysterious disappearance of Biela's comet received a reasonable\r\nexplanation by its association with the other great November\r\nshower--that which radiates from the constellation Andromeda. With\r\nregard to the last-named shower, it has not only been shown that\r\nthe meteors are associated with Biela's comet, but also that they\r\nseparated from it subsequent to 1841, in which year the comet's orbit\r\nwas modified by perturbations from Jupiter. The Andromeda meteors\r\nfollow the modified orbit, and hence must have been in close\r\nassociation with the comet when the perturbation was exercised.\r\n\r\nThe four outstanding meteor radiants are those named, but there are\r\nvery many others. Mr. Denning, to whom this branch of science owes so\r\nmuch, estimates the number of distinct radiants known at about 4,400;\r\nand it seems likely that every one of these showers, some of them, of\r\ncourse very feeble, represents some comet deceased. The history of a\r\nmeteor shower would appear to be something like this: When the comet,\r\nwhose executor it is, has but recently deceased, it will appear as a\r\nvery brilliant periodic shower, occurring on only one or two nights\r\nexactly at the point where the comet in its journeying would have\r\ncrossed the earth's track, and appearing only at the time when the\r\ncomet itself would have been there. Gradually the meteors get more and\r\nmore tailed out along the orbit, as runners of unequal staying powers\r\nget strung out over a track in a long race, until the displays may\r\nbe repeated, with somewhat diminished splendour, year after year for\r\nseveral years before and after the time when the parent comet is\r\ndue. At last they get thinly spread out over the whole orbit, and\r\nthe shower becomes an annual one, happening each year when the earth\r\ncrosses the orbit of the comet. This has already happened to the\r\nPerseid shower; at least 500,000,000 miles of the orbit of Biela's\r\ncomet are studded with representatives of the Andromedes; and the\r\nLeonid shower had already begun to show symptoms of the same process\r\nat its appearance in 1866. Readers will remember the disappointment\r\ncaused by the failure of the Leonid shower to come up to time in 1899,\r\nand it seems probable that the action of some perturbing cause has so\r\naltered the orbit of this shower that it now passes almost clear\r\nof the earth's path, so that we shall not have the opportunity of\r\nwitnessing another great display of the Leonid meteors.\r\n\r\nSo far as is known, no member of one of these great showers has\r\never fallen to the earth. There are two possible exceptions to this\r\nstatement, as in 1095 a meteor fell to the ground during the progress\r\nof a shower of Lyrids, and in 1885 another fell during a display of\r\nthe Andromedes. In neither case, however, was the radiant point noted,\r\nand unless it was the same as that of the shower the fall of the\r\nmeteor was a mere coincidence. It seems probable that this is the\r\ncase, and the absence of any evidence that a specimen from a cometary\r\nshower has reached the earth points to the extreme smallness of the\r\nvarious members of the shower and also to the fine division of the\r\nmatter of the original comet.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the meteors originating from systematic showers, there\r\nare also to be noted frequent and sometimes very brilliant single\r\nmeteors. Specimens of these have in many instances been obtained. They\r\nfall into three classes--'Those in which iron is found in considerable\r\namount are termed siderites; those containing an admixture of iron and\r\nstone, siderolites; and those consisting almost entirely of stone are\r\nknown as aerolites' (Denning). The mass of some of these bodies is\r\nvery considerable. Swords have been forged out of their iron, one of\r\nwhich is in the possession of President Diaz of Mexico, while diamonds\r\nhave been found in meteoric irons which fell in Arizona. It may\r\nbe interesting to know that, according to a grave decision of the\r\nAmerican courts, a meteor is 'real estate,' and belongs to the person\r\non whose ground it has fallen; the alternative--that it is 'wild\r\ngame,' and the property of its captor--having been rejected by the\r\ncourt. So far as I am aware, the legal status of these interesting\r\nflying creatures has not yet been determined in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe department of meteoric astronomy is one in which useful work can\r\nbe done with the minimum of appliances. The chief requisites are a\r\ngood set of star-maps, a sound knowledge of the constellations, a\r\nstraight wand, and, above all, patience. The student must make himself\r\nfamiliar with the constellations (a pleasant task, which should be\r\npart of everyone's education), so that when a meteor crosses his\r\nfield of view he may be able to identify at once with an approach to\r\naccuracy its points of appearance and disappearance. It is here that\r\nthe straight wand comes into play. Mr. Denning advises the use of it\r\nas a means of guiding the eye. It is held so as to coincide with the\r\npath of the meteor just seen, and will thus help the eye to estimate\r\nthe position and slope of the track relatively to the stars of the\r\nconstellations which it has crossed. This track should be marked as\r\nquickly as possible on the charts. Mere descriptions of the appearance\r\nof meteors, however beautiful, are quite valueless. It is very\r\ninteresting to be told that a meteor when first seen was 'of the size\r\nand colour of an orange,' but later 'of the apparent size of the\r\nfull moon, and surrounded by a mass of glowing vapour which further\r\nincreased its size to that of the head of a flour-barrel'; but the\r\ndescription is scarcely marked by sufficient precision of statement\r\nfor scientific purposes. The observer must note certain definite\r\npoints, of which the following is a summary: (1) Date, hour, and\r\nminute of appearance. (2) Brightness, compared with some well-known\r\nstar, planet, or, if exceptionally bright, with the moon. (3) Right\r\nascension and declination of point of first appearance. (4) The\r\nsame of point of disappearance. (5) Length of track. (6) Duration of\r\nvisibility. (7) Colour, presence of streak or train, and any other\r\nnotable features. (8) Radiant point.\r\n\r\nWhen these have been given with a reasonable approach to accuracy,\r\nthe observer has done his best to provide a real, though small,\r\ncontribution to the sum of human knowledge; nor is the determination\r\nof these points so difficult as would at first appear from their\r\nnumber. The fixing of the points of appearance and disappearance and\r\nof the radiant will present a little difficulty to start with; but in\r\nthis, as in all other matters, practice will bring efficiency. It may\r\nbe mentioned that the efforts of those who take up this subject would\r\nbe greatly increased in usefulness by their establishing a connection\r\nwith the Meteor Section of the British Astronomical Association.\r\n\r\nOne curious anomaly has been established by Mr. Denning's patient\r\nlabour--the existence, namely, of what are termed 'stationary\r\nradiants.' It is obvious that if meteors have the cometary connection\r\nalready indicated, their radiant point should never remain fixed; as\r\nthe showers move onwards in their orbit they should leave the original\r\nradiant behind. Mr. Denning has conclusively proved, however, that\r\nthere are showers which do not follow the rule in this respect, but\r\nproceed from a radiant which remains the same night after night, some\r\nfeeble showers maintaining the same radiant for several months. It is\r\nnot easy to see how this fact is to be reconciled with the theory of\r\ncometary origin; but the fact itself is undeniable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE STARRY HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now leave the bounds of our own system, and pass outwards towards\r\nthe almost infinite spaces and multitudes of the fixed stars. In doing\r\nso we are at once confronted with a wealth and profusion of beauty and\r\na vastness of scale which are almost overwhelming. Hitherto we have\r\nbeen dealing almost exclusively with bodies which, though sometimes\r\nconsiderably larger than our world, were yet, with the exception of\r\nthe sun, of the same class and comparable with it; and with distances\r\nwhich, though very great indeed, were still not absolutely beyond the\r\npower of apprehension. But now all former scales and standards have to\r\nbe left behind, for even the vast orbit of Neptune, 5,600,000,000\r\nof miles in diameter, shrinks into a point when compared with the\r\nsmallest of the stellar distances. Even our unit of measurement has\r\nto be changed, for miles, though counted in hundreds of millions, are\r\ninadequate; and, accordingly, the unit in which our distance from the\r\nstars is expressed is the 'light year,' or the distance travelled by a\r\nray of light in a year.\r\n\r\nLight travels at the rate of about 186,000 miles a second, and\r\ntherefore leaps the great gulf between our earth and the sun in\r\nabout eight minutes. But even the nearest of the fixed stars--Alpha\r\nCentauri, a star of the first magnitude in the Southern Hemisphere--is\r\nso incredibly distant that light takes four years and four months to\r\ntravel to us from it; while the next nearest, a small star in Ursa\r\nMajor, is about seven light-years distant, and the star 61 of the\r\nconstellation Cygnus, the first northern star whose distance was\r\nmeasured, is separated from us by two years more still.\r\n\r\nAt present the distances of about 100 stars are known approximately;\r\nbut it must be remembered that the approximation is a somewhat\r\nrough one. The late Mr. Cowper Ranyard once remarked of measures of\r\nstar-distances that they would be considered rough by a cook who was\r\nin the habit of measuring her salt by the cupful and her pepper by the\r\npinch. And the remark has some truth--not because of any carelessness\r\nin the measurements, for they are the results of the most minute and\r\nscrupulous work with the most refined instrumental means that modern\r\nskill can devise and construct--but because the quantities to be\r\nmeasured are almost infinitely small.\r\n\r\nIt is at present considered that the average distance from the earth\r\nof stars of the first magnitude is thirty-three light years, that of\r\nstars of the second fifty-two, and of the third eighty-two. In other\r\nwords, when we look at such stars on any particular evening, we are\r\nseeing them, not as they are at the moment of observation, but as they\r\nwere thirty-three, fifty-two, or eighty-two years ago, when the rays\r\nof light which render them visible to us started on their almost\r\ninconceivable journey. The fact of the average distance of\r\nfirst-magnitude stars being less than that of second, and that of\r\nsecond in turn less than that of third, is not to be held as implying\r\nthat there are not comparatively small stars nearer to us than some\r\nvery bright ones. Several insignificant stars are considerably nearer\r\nto us than some of the most brilliant objects in the heavens--_e.g._,\r\n61 Cygni, which is of magnitude 4·8, is almost infinitely nearer to us\r\nthan the very brilliant first magnitude star Rigel in Orion. The rule\r\nholds only on the average.\r\n\r\nThe number of the stars is not less amazing than their distance. It is\r\ntrue that the number visible to the unaided eye is not by any means\r\nso great as might be imagined on a casual survey. On a clear night the\r\neye receives the impression that the multitude of stars is so great\r\nas to be utterly beyond counting; but this is not the case. The\r\nnaked-eye, or 'lucid,' stars have frequently been counted, and it\r\nhas been found that the number visible to a good average eye in\r\nboth hemispheres together is about 6,000. This would give for each\r\nhemisphere 3,000, and making allowance for those lost to sight in\r\nthe denser air near the horizon, or invisible by reason of restricted\r\nhorizon, it is probable that the number of stars visible at any one\r\ntime to any single observer in either hemisphere does not exceed\r\n2,500. In fact Pickering estimates the total number visible, down to\r\nand including the sixth magnitude, to be only 2,509 for the Northern\r\nHemisphere, and on that basis it may safely be assumed that 2,000\r\nwould be the extreme limit for the average eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVII.\r\n\r\nRegion of the Milky Way in Sagittarius. Photographed by Professor E.\r\nE. Barnard.]\r\n\r\nBut this somewhat disappointing result is more than atoned for when\r\nthe telescope is called in and the true richness of the heavenly host\r\nbegins to appear. Let us take for illustration a familiar group of\r\nstars--the Pleiades. The number of stars visible to an ordinary eye\r\nin this little group is six; keen-sighted people see eleven, or even\r\nfourteen. A small telescope converts the Pleiades into a brilliant\r\narray of luminous points to be counted not by units but by scores,\r\nwhile the plates taken with a modern photographic telescope of 13\r\ninches aperture show 2,326 stars. The Pleiades, of course, are a\r\nsomewhat notable group; but those who have seen any of the beautiful\r\nphotographs of the heavens, now so common, will know that in many\r\nparts of the sky even this great increase in number is considerably\r\nexceeded; and that for every star the eye sees in such regions a\r\nmoderate telescope will show 1,000, and a great instrument perhaps\r\n10,000. It is extremely probable that the number of stars visible with\r\nthe largest telescopes at present in use would not be overstated at\r\n100,000,000 (Plate XXVII.).\r\n\r\nIt is evident, on the most casual glance at the sky, that in the words\r\nof Scripture, 'One star differeth from another star in glory.' There\r\nare stars of every degree of brilliancy, from the sparkling white\r\nlustre of Sirius or Vega, down to the dim glimmer of those stars\r\nwhich are just on the edge of visibility, and are blotted out by the\r\nfaintest wisp of haze. Accordingly, the stars have been divided into\r\n'magnitudes' in terms of scales which, though arbitrary, are yet found\r\nto be of general convenience. Stars of the first six magnitudes come\r\nunder the title of 'lucid' stars; below the sixth we come to the\r\ntelescopic stars, none of which are visible to the naked eye, and\r\nwhich range down to the very last degree of faintness. Of stars of the\r\nfirst magnitude there are recognised about twenty, more or less.\r\nBy far the brightest star visible to us in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nthough it is really below the Equator, is Sirius, whose brightness\r\nexceeds by no fewer than fourteen and a half times that of Regulus,\r\nthe twentieth star on the list. The next brightest stars, Canopus and\r\nAlpha Centauri, are also Southern stars, and are not visible to us\r\nin middle latitudes. The three brightest of our truly Northern stars,\r\nVega, Capella, and Arcturus, come immediately after Alpha Centauri,\r\nand opinions are much divided as to their relative brightness, their\r\ndiversity in colour and in situation rendering a comparison somewhat\r\ndifficult. The other conspicuous stars of the first magnitude visible\r\nin our latitudes are, in order of brightness, Rigel, Procyon, Altair,\r\nBetelgeux, Aldebaran, Pollux, Spica Virginis, Antares, Fomalhaut,\r\nArided (Alpha Cygni), and Regulus, the well-known double star Castor\r\nfollowing not far behind Regulus. The second magnitude embraces,\r\naccording to Argelander, 65 stars; the third, 190; fourth, 425; fifth,\r\n1,100; sixth, 3,200; while for the ninth magnitude the number leaps\r\nup to 142,000. It is thus seen that the number of stars increases with\r\nenormous rapidity as the smaller magnitudes come into question, and,\r\naccording to Newcomb, there is no evidence of any falling off in\r\nthe ratio of increase up to the tenth magnitude. In the smaller\r\nmagnitudes, however, the ratio of increase does not maintain itself.\r\nThe number of the stars, though very great, is not infinite.\r\n\r\nA further fact which quickly becomes apparent to the naked eye is that\r\nthe stars are not all of the same colour. Sirius, for example, is of a\r\nbrilliant white, with a steely glitter; Betelgeux, comparatively near\r\nto it in the sky, is of a beautiful topaz tint, perhaps on the whole\r\nthe most exquisite single star in the sky, so far as regards colour;\r\nAldebaran is orange-yellow, while Vega is white with a bluish cast,\r\nas is also Rigel. These diversities become much more apparent when\r\nthe telescope is employed. At the same time the observer may be warned\r\nagainst expecting too much in the way of colour, for, as a matter of\r\nfact, the colours of the stars, while perfectly manifest, are yet of\r\ngreat delicacy, and it is difficult to describe them in ordinary terms\r\nwithout some suspicion of exaggeration. Stars of a reddish tone, which\r\nranges from the merest shade of orange-yellow up to a fairly deep\r\norange, are not uncommon; several first-magnitude stars, as already\r\nnoted, have distinct orange tones. For anything approaching to real\r\nblues and greens, we must go to the smaller stars, and the finest\r\nexamples of blue or green stars are found in the smaller members of\r\nsome of the double systems. Thus in the case of the double Beta Cygni\r\n(Albireo), one of the most beautiful and easy telescopic objects in\r\nthe northern sky, the larger star is orange-yellow, and the smaller\r\nblue; in that of Gamma Andromedæ the larger is yellow, and the smaller\r\nbluish-green; while Gamma Leonis has a large yellow star, and a small\r\ngreenish-yellow one in connection. The student who desires to pursue\r\nthe subject of star colours should possess himself of the catalogue\r\npublished in the Memoirs of the British Astronomical Association,\r\nwhich gives the colours of the lucid stars determined from the mean of\r\na very large number of observations made by different observers.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noticed that there is some suspicion that\r\nthe colours of certain stars have changed within historic times, or\r\nat least that they have not the same colour now which they are said\r\nto have had in former days. The evidence is not in any instance strong\r\nenough to warrant the assertion that actual change has taken place;\r\nbut it is perfectly natural to suppose that it does, and indeed must\r\ngradually progress. As the stars are intensely hot bodies, there must\r\nhave been periods when their heat was gradually rising to its maximum,\r\nand there must be periods when they will gradually cool off to\r\nextinction, and these stages must be represented by changes in the\r\ncolour of the particular star in question. In all probability, then,\r\nthe colour of a star gives some indication of the stage to which it\r\nhas advanced in its life-history; and as a matter of fact, this proves\r\nto be so, the colour of a star being found to be generally a fair\r\nindication of what its constitution, as revealed by the spectroscope,\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the stars which cannot fail to be noticed is the\r\nfact that they are not evenly distributed over the heavens, but are\r\ngrouped into a variety of configurations or constellations. In the\r\nvery dawn of human history these configurations woke the imaginations\r\nof the earliest star-gazers, and fanciful shapes and titles were\r\nattached to the star-groups, which have been handed down to the\r\npresent time, and are still in use. It must be confessed that in\r\nsome cases it takes a very lively imagination to find any resemblance\r\nbetween the constellation and the figure which has been associated\r\nwith it. The anatomy of Pegasus, for example, would scarcely commend\r\nitself to a horse-breeder, while the student will look in vain for any\r\nresemblance to a human figure, heroic or unheroic, in the straggling\r\ngroup of stars which bears the name of Hercules. At the same time a\r\nfew of the constellations do more or less resemble the objects from\r\nwhich their titles are derived. Thus the figure of a man may without\r\nany great difficulty be traced among the brilliant stars which form\r\nthe beautiful constellation Orion; while Delphinus presents at least\r\nan approximation to a fish-like form, and Corona Borealis gives the\r\nhalf of a diadem of sparkling jewels.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the constellations, and, if possible, of the curious\r\nold myths and legends attaching to them, should form part of the\r\nequipment of every educated person; yet very few people can tell one\r\ngroup from another, much less say what constellations are visible at\r\na given hour at any particular season of the year. People who are\r\ncontent merely to gape at the heavens in 'a wonderful clear night\r\nof stars' little know how much interest they are losing. When the\r\nconstellations and the chief stars are learned and kept in memory, the\r\nface of the sky becomes instinct with interest, and each successive\r\nseason brings with it the return of some familiar group which is\r\nhailed as one hails an old friend. Nor is the task of becoming\r\nfamiliar with the constellations one of any difficulty. Indeed, there\r\nare few pleasanter tasks than to trace out the figures of the old\r\nheroes and heroines of mythology by the help of a simple star-map,\r\nand once learned, they need never be forgotten. In this branch of the\r\nsubject there are many easily accessible helps. For a simple guide,\r\nPeck's 'Constellations and how to Find Them' is both cheap and useful,\r\nwhile Newcomb's 'Astronomy for Everybody' and Maunder's 'Astronomy\r\nwithout a Telescope' also give careful and simple directions.\r\nMaunder's volume is particularly useful for a beginner, combining,\r\nas it does, most careful instructions as to the tracing of the\r\nconstellations with a set of clear and simple star-charts, and a most\r\ninteresting discussion of the origin of these ancient star-groups.\r\nA list of the northern constellations with a few of the most notable\r\nobjects of interest in each will be found in Appendix II.\r\n\r\nWinding among the constellations, and forming a gigantic belt round\r\nthe whole star-sphere, lies that most wonderful feature of the heavens\r\nfamiliar to all under the name of the Milky Way. This great luminous\r\ngirdle of the sky may be seen in some portion of its extent, and at\r\nsome hour of the night, at all seasons of the year, though in May it\r\nis somewhat inconveniently placed for observation. Roughly speaking,\r\nit presents the appearance of a broad arch or pathway of misty light,\r\n'whose groundwork is of stars'; but the slightest attention will\r\nreveal the fact that in reality its structure is of great complexity.\r\nIt throws out streamers on either side and at all angles, condenses at\r\nvarious points into cloudy masses of much greater brilliancy than the\r\naverage, strangely pierced sometimes by dark gaps through which we\r\nseem to look into infinite and almost tenantless space (Plate XXVII.),\r\nwhile in other quarters it spreads away in considerable width, and\r\nto such a degree of faintness that the eye can scarcely tell where it\r\nends. At a point in the constellation Cygnus, well seen during autumn\r\nand the early months of winter, it splits up into two great branches\r\nwhich run separate to the Southern horizon with a well-marked dark gap\r\ndividing them.\r\n\r\nWhen examined with any telescopic power, the Milky Way reveals itself\r\nas a wonderful collection of stars and star-clusters; and it will also\r\nbe found that there is a very remarkable tendency among the stars to\r\ngather in the neighbourhood of this great starry belt. So much is this\r\ncase that, in the words of Professor Newcomb, 'Were the cloud-forms\r\nwhich make up the Milky Way invisible to us, we should still be able\r\nto mark out its course by the crowding of the lucid stars towards it.'\r\nNot less remarkable is the fact that the distribution of the nebulæ\r\nwith regard to the Galaxy is precisely the opposite of that of the\r\nstars. There are, of course, many nebulæ in the Galaxy; but, at the\r\nsame time, they are comparatively less numerous along its course, and\r\ngrow more and more numerous in proportion as we depart from it. It\r\nseems impossible to avoid the conclusion that these twin facts are\r\nintimately related to one another, though the explanation of them is\r\nnot yet forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1665 the famous astronomer Hooke wrote concerning the\r\nsmall star Gamma Arietis: 'I took notice that it consisted of two\r\nsmall stars very near together; a like instance of which I have not\r\nelse met with in all the heavens.' This is the first English record\r\nof the observation of a double star, though Riccioli detected the\r\nduplicity of Zeta Ursæ Majoris (Mizar), in 1650, and Huygens saw three\r\nstars in Theta Orionis in 1656. These were the earliest beginnings\r\nof double-star observation, which has since grown to such proportions\r\nthat double stars are now numbered in the heavens by thousands. Of\r\ncourse, certain stars appear to be double even when viewed with the\r\nunaided eye. Thus Mizar, a bright star in the handle of the Plough,\r\nreferred to above, has not far from it a fainter companion known as\r\nAlcor, which the Arabs used to consider a test of vision. Either it\r\nhas brightened in modern times, or else the Arabs have received too\r\nmuch credit for keenness of sight, for Mizar and Alcor now make a\r\npair that is quite easy to very ordinary sight even in our turbid\r\natmosphere. Alpha Capricorni, and Zeta Ceti, with Iota Orionis are\r\nalso instances of naked-eye doubles, while exceptionally keen sight\r\nwill detect that the star Epsilon Lyræ, which forms a little triangle\r\nwith the brilliant Vega and Zeta Lyræ, is double, or at least that it\r\nis not single, but slightly elongated in form. Astronomers, however,\r\nwould not call such objects as these 'double stars' at all; they\r\nreserve that title for stars which are very much closer together than\r\nthe components of a naked-eye double can ever be. The last-mentioned\r\nstar, Epsilon Lyræ, affords a very good example of the distinction. To\r\nthe naked eye it is, generally speaking, not to be distinguished\r\nfrom a single star. Keen sight elongates it; exceptionally keen sight\r\ndivides it into two stars extremely close to one another. But on using\r\neven a very moderate telescope, say a 2-1/2-inch with a power of\r\n100 or upwards, the two stars which the keenest sight could barely\r\nseparate are seen widely apart in the field, while each of them has\r\nin its turn split up into two little dots of light. Thus, to the\r\ntelescope, Epsilon Lyræ is really a quadruple star, while in addition\r\nthere is a faint star forming a triangle with the two pairs, and a\r\nlarge instrument will reveal two very faint stars, the 'debilissima,'\r\none on either side of the line joining the larger stars. These I have\r\nseen with 3-7/8-inch.\r\n\r\nWhat the telescope does with Epsilon Lyræ, it does with a great\r\nmultitude of other stars. There are thousands of doubles of all\r\ndegrees of easiness and difficulty--doubles wide apart, and doubles so\r\nclose that only the finest telescopes in the world can separate\r\nthem; doubles of every degree of likeness or of disparity in their\r\ncomponents, from Alpha Geminorum (Castor), with its two beautiful\r\nstars of almost equal lustre, to Sirius, where the chief star is the\r\nbrightest in all the heavens, and the companion so small, or rather so\r\nfaint, that it takes a very fine glass to pick it out in the glare\r\nof its great primary. The student will find in these double stars an\r\nextremely good series of tests for the quality of his telescope.\r\nThey are, further, generally objects of great beauty, being often\r\ncharacterized, as already mentioned, by diversity of colour in the\r\ntwo components. Thus, in addition to the examples given above,\r\nEta Cassiopeiæ presents the beautiful picture of a yellow star in\r\nconjunction with a red one, while Epsilon Boötis has been described as\r\n'most beautiful yellow and superb blue,' and Alpha Herculis consists\r\nof an orange star close to one which is emerald green. It has been\r\nsuggested that the colours in such instances are merely complementary,\r\nthe impression of orange or yellow in the one star producing a purely\r\nsubjective impression of blue or green when the other is viewed; but\r\nit has been conclusively proved that the colours of very many of the\r\nsmaller stars in such cases are actual and inherent.\r\n\r\nNot only are there thousands of double stars in the heavens, but there\r\nare also many multiple stars, where the telescope splits an apparently\r\nsingle star up into three, four, or sometimes six or seven separate\r\nstars. Of these multiples, one of the best known is Theta Orionis. It\r\nis the middle star of the sword which hangs from the belt of Orion,\r\nand is, of course, notable from its connection with the Great Nebula;\r\nbut it is also a very beautiful multiple star. A 2-1/2-inch telescope\r\nwill show that it consists of four stars in the form of a trapezium;\r\nlarge instruments show two excessively faint stars in addition. Again,\r\nin the same constellation lies Sigma Orionis, immediately below the\r\nlowermost star of the giant's belt. In a 3-inch telescope this\r\nstar splits up into a beautiful multiple of six components, their\r\ndifferences in size and tint making the little group a charming\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nLooking at the multitude of double and multiple stars, the question\r\ncan scarcely fail to suggest itself: Is there any real connection\r\nbetween the stars which thus appear so close to one another? It can\r\nbe readily understood that the mere fact of their appearing close\r\ntogether in the field of the telescope does not necessarily imply\r\nreal closeness. Two gas-lamps, for instance, may appear quite close\r\ntogether to an observer who is at some distance from them, when in\r\nreality they may be widely separated one from the other--the apparent\r\ncloseness being due to the fact that they are almost in the same\r\nline of sight. No doubt many of the stars which appear double in the\r\ntelescope are of this class--'optical doubles,' as they are called,\r\nand are in reality separated by vast distances from one another.\r\nBut the great majority have not only an apparent, but also a real\r\ncloseness; and in a number of cases this is proved by the fact that\r\nobservation shows the stars in question to be physically connected,\r\nand to revolve around a common centre of gravity. Double stars which\r\nare thus physically connected are known as 'binaries.' The discovery\r\nof the existence of this real connection between some double stars is\r\ndue, like so many of the most interesting astronomical discoveries,\r\nto Sir William Herschel. At present the number of stars known to be\r\nbinary is somewhat under one thousand; but in the case of most\r\nof these, the revolution round a common centre which proves their\r\nphysical connection is extremely slow, and consequently the majority\r\nof binary stars have as yet been followed only through a small portion\r\nof their orbits, and the change of position sufficient to enable\r\na satisfactory orbit to be computed has occurred in only a small\r\nproportion of the total number. The first binary star to have its\r\norbit computed was Xi Ursæ Majoris, whose revolution of about sixty\r\nyears has been twice completed since, in 1780, Sir William Herschel\r\ndiscovered it to be double.\r\n\r\nThe star which has the shortest period at present known is the fourth\r\nmagnitude Delta Equulei, which has a fifth magnitude companion. The\r\npair complete their revolution, according to Hussey, in 5·7 years.\r\nKappa Pegasi comes next in speed of revolution, with a period of\r\neleven and a half years, while the star 85 of the same constellation\r\ntakes rather more than twice as long to complete its orbit. From such\r\nswiftly circling pairs as these, the periods range up to hundreds of\r\nyears. Thus, for example, the well-known double star Castor, probably\r\nthe most beautiful double in the northern heavens, and certainly the\r\nbest object of its class for a small telescope, is held to have a\r\nperiod of 347 years, which, though long enough, is a considerable\r\nreduction upon the 1,000 once attributed to it.\r\n\r\nBut the number of binary stars known is not confined to those which\r\nhave been discovered and measured by means of the telescope and\r\nmicrometer. One of the most wonderful results of modern astronomical\r\nresearch has been the discovery of the fact that many stars have\r\nrevolving round them invisible companions, which are either dark\r\nbodies, or else are so close to their primaries as for ever to defy\r\nthe separating powers of our telescopes. The discovery of these\r\ndark, or at least invisible, companions is one of the most remarkable\r\ntriumphs of the spectroscope. It was in 1888 that Vogel first applied\r\nthe spectroscopic method to the well-known variable star, Beta\r\nPersei--known as Algol, 'the Demon,' from its 'slowly-winking eye.'\r\nThe variation in the light of Algol is very large, from second to\r\nfourth magnitude; Vogel therefore reasoned that if this variation were\r\ncaused by a dark companion partially eclipsing the bright star, the\r\ncompanion must be sufficiently large to cause motion in Algol--that\r\nis, to cause both stars to revolve round a common centre of gravity.\r\nShould this be the case, then at one point of its orbit Algol must be\r\napproaching, and at the opposite point receding from the earth; and\r\ntherefore the shift of the lines of its spectrum towards the violet\r\nin the one instance and towards the red in the other would settle\r\nthe question of whether it had or had not an invisible companion.\r\nThe spectroscopic evidence proved quite conclusive. It was found that\r\nbefore its eclipses, Algol was receding from the sun at the rate\r\nof 26-1/3 miles per second, while after eclipse there was a similar\r\nmotion of approach; and therefore the hypothesis of an invisible\r\ncompanion was proved to be fact. Vogel carried his researches further,\r\nhis inquiry into the questions of the size and distance apart of\r\nthe two bodies leading him to the conclusion that the bright star is\r\nrather more, and its companion rather less than 1,000,000 miles in\r\ndiameter; while the distance which divides them is somewhat more than\r\n3,000,000 miles. Though larger, both bodies prove to be less massive\r\nthan our sun, Algol being estimated at four-ninths and its companion\r\nat two-ninths of the solar mass.\r\n\r\nThe class of double star disclosed in this manner is known as the\r\n'spectroscopic binary,' and has various other types differing from\r\nthe Algol type. Thus the type of which Xi Ursæ Majoris was the first\r\ndetected instance has two component bodies not differing greatly in\r\nbrightness from one another. In such a case the fact of the star being\r\nbinary is revealed through the consideration that in any binary system\r\nthe two components must necessarily always be moving in opposite\r\ndirections. Hence the shift of the lines of their spectrum will be\r\nin opposite directions also, and when one of the stars (A) is moving\r\ntowards us, and the other (B) away from us, all the lines of the\r\nspectrum which are common to the two will appear double, those of A\r\nbeing displaced towards the violet and those of B towards the red.\r\nAfter a quarter of a revolution, when the stars are momentarily in\r\na straight line with us, the lines will all appear single; but after\r\nhalf a revolution they will again be displaced, those of A this time\r\ntowards the red and those of B towards the violet.\r\n\r\nThere has thus been opened up an entirely new field of research, and\r\nthe idea, long cherished, that the stars might prove to have dark, or,\r\nat all events, invisible, companions attendant on them, somewhat as\r\nour own sun has its planets, has been proved to be perfectly sound.\r\nSo far, in the case of dark companions, only bodies of such vast size\r\nhave been detected as to render any comparison with the planets of\r\nour system difficult; but the principle is established, and the\r\nprobability of great numbers of the stars having real planetary\r\nsystems attendant on them is so great as to become practically a\r\ncertainty. 'We naturally infer,' says Professor Newcomb, 'that ...\r\ninnumerable stars may have satellites, planets, or companion stars so\r\nclose or so faint as to elude our powers of observation.'\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of spectroscopic binaries we naturally turn\r\nto that of variable stars, the two classes being, to some extent at\r\nleast, coincident, as is evidenced by the case of Algol. While the\r\ndiscovery of spectroscopic binaries is one of the latest results of\r\nresearch, that of variability among stars dates from comparatively\r\nfar back in the history of astronomy. As early as the year 1596 David\r\nFabricius noted the star now known as Omicron Ceti, or Mira, 'the\r\nWonderful,' as being of the third magnitude, while in the following\r\nyear he found that it had vanished. A succession of appearances and\r\ndisappearances was witnessed in the middle of the next century by\r\nHolwarda, and from that time the star has been kept under careful\r\nobservation, and its variations have been determined with some\r\nexactness, though there are anomalies as yet unexplained. 'Once in\r\neleven months,' writes Miss Clerke, 'the star mounts up in about 125\r\ndays from below the ninth to near the third, or even to the second\r\nmagnitude; then, after a pause of two or three weeks, drops again\r\nto its former low level in once and a half times, on an average, the\r\nduration of its rise.' This most extraordinary fluctuation means that\r\nat a bright maximum Mira emits 1,500 times as much light as at a low\r\nminimum. The star thus subject to such remarkable outbursts is, like\r\nmost variables, of a reddish colour, and at maximum its spectrum shows\r\nthe presence of glowing hydrogen. Its average period is about 331\r\ndays; but this period is subject to various irregularities, and\r\nthe maximum has sometimes been as much as two months away from the\r\npredicted time. Mira Ceti may be taken as the type of the numerous\r\nclass of stars known as 'long-period variables.'\r\n\r\nNot less interesting are those stars whose variations cover only short\r\nperiods, extending from less than thirty days down to a few hours. Of\r\nthese, perhaps the most easily observed, as it is also one of the most\r\nremarkable, is Beta Lyræ. This star is one of the two bright stars of\r\nnearly equal magnitude which form an obtuse-angled triangle with the\r\nbrilliant first-magnitude star Vega. The other star of the pair\r\nis Gamma Lyræ, and between them lies the famous Ring Nebula, to be\r\nreferred to later. Ordinarily Beta Lyræ is of magnitude 3·4, but from\r\nthis it passes, in a period of rather less than thirteen days, through\r\ntwo minima, in one of which it descends to magnitude 3·9 and in\r\nthe other to 4·5. This fluctuation seems trifling. It really means,\r\nhowever, that at maximum the star is two and three-quarter times\r\nbrighter than when it sinks to magnitude 4·5; and the variation can be\r\neasily recognised by the naked eye, owing to the fact of the nearness\r\nof so convenient a comparison star as Gamma Lyræ. Beta Lyræ is a\r\nmember of the class of spectroscopic binaries, and belongs to that\r\ntype of the class in which the mutually eclipsing bodies are both\r\nbright. In such cases the variation in brilliancy is caused by the\r\nfact that when the two bodies are, so to speak, side by side, light\r\nis received from both of them, and a maximum is observed; while, when\r\nthey are end on, both in line with ourselves, one cuts off more or\r\nless of the other's light from us, thus causing a minimum.\r\n\r\nA third class, distinct from either of the preceding, is that of the\r\nAlgol Variables, so-called from the bright star Beta Persei, which has\r\nalready been mentioned as a spectroscopic binary. Than this star\r\nthere is no more notable variable in the heavens, and its situation\r\nfortunately renders it peculiarly easy of observation to northern\r\nstudents. Algol shines for about fifty-nine hours as a star of small\r\nsecond magnitude, then suddenly begins to lose light, and in four and\r\na half hours has fallen to magnitude three and a half, losing in so\r\nshort a space two-thirds of its normal brilliancy. It remains in\r\nthis degraded condition for only fifteen minutes, and then begins to\r\nrecover, reaching its normal lustre in about five hours more. These\r\nremarkable changes, due, as before mentioned, to the presence of\r\nan invisible eclipsing companion, are gone through with the utmost\r\nregularity, so much so that, as Gore says, the minima of Algol 'can\r\nbe predicted with as much certainty as an eclipse of the sun.' The\r\nfeatures of the type-star are more or less closely reproduced in the\r\nother Algol Variables--a comparatively long period of steady light\r\nemission, followed by a rapid fall to one or more minima, and a rapid\r\nrecovery of light. The class as yet is a small one, but new members\r\nare gradually being added to it, the majority of them white, like the\r\ntype-star.\r\n\r\nThe study of variable stars is one which should seem to be specially\r\nreserved for the amateur observer. In general, it requires but little\r\ninstrumental equipment. Many variables can be seen at maximum, some\r\neven at minimum, with the unaided eye; in other cases a good opera or\r\nfield glass is all that is required, and a 2-1/2 or 3-inch telescope\r\nwill enable the observer to command quite an extensive field of work.\r\nHere, again, the beginner may be referred to the _Memoirs_ of the\r\nBritish Astronomical Association for help and guidance, and may be\r\nadvised to connect himself with the Variable Star Section.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of such variations in the lustre of certain stars\r\nas have been described, the aspect of the heavens is, in general,\r\nfixed and unchanging. There are, as we shall see, real changes of the\r\nvastest importance continually going on; but the distances separating\r\nus from the fixed stars are so enormous that these changes shrink into\r\nnothingness, and the astronomers of forty centuries before our era\r\nwould find comparatively little change today in the aspect of the\r\nconstellations with which they were familiar. But occasionally a\r\nvery remarkable change does take place, in the apparition of a new or\r\ntemporary star. The accounts of the appearance of such objects are not\r\nvery numerous, but are of great interest. We pass over those recorded,\r\nin more or less casual fashion, by the ancients, for the reason\r\nthat the descriptions given are in general more picturesque than\r\nilluminative. It does not add much to one's knowledge, though it may\r\nexcite wonder, to find the Chinese annals recording the appearance, in\r\nA.D. 173, of a new star 'resembling a large bamboo mat!'\r\n\r\nThe first Nova, of which we have a really scientific record, was the\r\nstar which suddenly blazed out, in November, 1572, in the familiar\r\nW of Cassiopeia. It was carefully observed by the great astronomer,\r\nTycho Brahé, and, according to him, was brighter than Sirius, Alpha\r\nLyræ, or Jupiter. Tycho followed it till March, 1574, by which time\r\nit had sunk to the limit of unaided vision, and further observation\r\nbecame impossible. There is at present a star of the eleventh\r\nmagnitude close to the place fixed for the Nova from Tycho's\r\nobservations. In 1604 and 1670, new stars were observed, the first by\r\nKepler and his assistants, the second by the monk Anthelme; but from\r\n1670 there was a long break in the list of discoveries, which was\r\nended by Hind's observation of a new star in Ophiuchus (April, 1848).\r\nThis was never a very conspicuous object, rising only to somewhat less\r\nthan fourth magnitude, and soon fading to tenth or eleventh. We\r\ncan only mention the 'Blaze Star' of Corona Borealis, discovered by\r\nBirmingham in 1866, the Nova discovered in 1876 by Schmidt of Athens,\r\nnear Rho Cygni--an object which seems to have faded out into a\r\nplanetary nebula, a fate apparently characteristic of this class of\r\nstar--and the star which appeared in 1885, close to the nucleus of the\r\nGreat Nebula in Andromeda.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, Dr. Anderson of Edinburgh discovered in the constellation\r\nAuriga a star which he estimated as of fifth magnitude. The discovery\r\nwas made on January 31, and the new star was found to have been\r\nphotographed at Harvard on plates taken from December 16, 1891, to\r\nJanuary 31, 1892. Apparently this Nova differed from other temporary\r\nstars in the fact that it attained its full brightness only gradually.\r\nBy February 3 it rose to magnitude 3·5, then faded by April 1 to\r\nfifteenth, but in August brightened up again to about ninth\r\nmagnitude. It is now visible as a small star. The great development\r\nof spectroscopic resources brought this object, otherwise not a very\r\nconspicuous one, under the closest scrutiny. Its spectrum showed many\r\nbright lines, which were accompanied by dark ones on the side next the\r\nblue. The idea was thus suggested that the outburst of brilliancy was\r\ndue to a collision between two bodies, one of which, that causing the\r\ndark lines, was approaching the earth, while the other was receding\r\nfrom it. Lockyer considered the conflagration to be due to a collision\r\nbetween two swarms of meteorites, Huggins that it was caused by the\r\nnear approach to one another of two gaseous bodies, while others\r\nsuggested that the rush of a star or of a swarm of meteorites through\r\na nebula would explain the facts observed. Subsequent observations of\r\nthe spectrum of Nova Aurigæ have revealed the fact that it has obeyed\r\nthe destiny which seems to wait on temporary stars, having become a\r\nplanetary nebula.\r\n\r\nDr. Anderson followed up his first achievement by the discovery of a\r\nbrilliant Nova in the constellation Perseus. The discovery was made\r\non the night of February 21-22, 1901, the star being then of magnitude\r\n2·7. Within two days it became about the third brightest star in the\r\nsky, being a little more brilliant than Capella; but before the middle\r\nof April it had sunk to fifth magnitude. The rapidity of its rise must\r\nhave been phenomenal! A plate exposed at Harvard on February 19, and\r\nshowing stars to the eleventh magnitude, bore no trace of the Nova.\r\n'It must therefore,' says Newcomb, 'have risen from some magnitude\r\nbelow the eleventh to the first within about three days. This\r\ndifference corresponds to an increase of the light ten thousandfold!'\r\nSuch a statement leaves the mind simply appalled before the spectacle\r\nof a cataclysm so infinitely transcending the very wildest dreams of\r\nfancy. Subsequent observations have shown the usual tendency towards\r\ndevelopment into a nebula, and in August, 1901, photographs were\r\nactually obtained of a nebulosity round the star, showing remarkable\r\ncondensations. These photographs, taken at Yerkes Observatory, when\r\ncompared with others taken at Mount Hamilton in November, revealed the\r\nstartling fact that the condensations of the nebula were apparently\r\nin extraordinarily rapid motion. Now the Nova shows no appreciable\r\nparallax, or in other words is so distant that its distance cannot be\r\nmeasured; on what scale, therefore, must these motions have been to be\r\nrecorded plainly across a gulf measurable perhaps in hundreds of light\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nNova Geminorum, discovered by Professor Turner, at Oxford, in March,\r\n1903, had not the striking features which lent so much interest to\r\nNova Persei. It showed a crimson colour, and its spectrum indicated\r\nthe presence in its blaze of hydrogen and helium; but it faded so\r\nrapidly as to show that the disturbance affected a comparatively small\r\nbody, and it has exhibited the familiar new star change into a nebula.\r\n\r\nOne point with regard to the Novæ in Auriga and Perseus deserves\r\nnotice. These discoveries, so remarkable in themselves, and so\r\nfruitful in the extension of our knowledge, were made by an amateur\r\nobserver with no greater equipment than a small pocket telescope and a\r\nKlein's Star-Atlas. The thorough knowledge of the face of the heavens\r\nwhich enabled Dr. Anderson to pick out the faint glimmer of Nova\r\nAurigæ and to be certain that the star was a new one is not in the\r\nleast unattainable by anyone who cares to give time and patience to\r\nits acquisition; and even should the study never be rewarded by a\r\ncapture so dramatic as that of Nova Persei, the familiarity gained\r\nin its course with the beauty and wonder of the star-sphere will in\r\nitself be an ample reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCLUSTERS AND NEBULÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the most casual observer of the heavens cannot have failed to\r\nnotice that in certain instances the stars are grouped so closely\r\ntogether as to form well-marked clusters. The most familiar example\r\nis the well-known group of the Pleiades, in the constellation Taurus,\r\nwhile quite close is the more scattered group of the Hyades. Another\r\nsomewhat coarsely scattered group is that known as Coma Berenices, the\r\nHair of Berenice, which lies beneath the handle of the Plough; and a\r\nfainter group is the cluster Præsepe, which lies in the inconspicuous\r\nconstellation Cancer, between Gemini and Leo, appearing to the naked\r\neye like a fairly bright, hazy patch, which the smallest telescope\r\nresolves into a cloud of faint stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVIII.\r\n\r\n  1.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\n\r\nIrregular Star Clusters. Photographed by E. E. Barnard.\r\n\r\n  1. Messier 35 in Gemini.      2. Double Cluster in Perseus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades form undoubtedly the most remarkable naked-eye group in\r\nthe heavens. The six stars which are visible to average eyesight are\r\nAlcyone, 3rd magnitude; Maia, Electra, and Atlas, of the 4th; Merope,\r\n4-1/3; and Taygeta, 4-1/2. While Celæno, 5-1/3; Pleione, 5-1/2; and\r\nAsterope, 6, hang on the verge of visibility. With an opera-glass\r\nabout thirty more may be counted, while photographs show between\r\n2,000 and 3,000. It is probable that the fainter stars have no real\r\nconnection with the cluster itself, which is merely seen upon a\r\nbackground of more distant star-dust. Modern photographs have shown\r\nthat this cluster is involved in a great nebula, which stretches in\r\ncurious wisps and straight lines from star to star, and surrounds\r\nthe whole group. The Pleiades make a brilliant object for a small\r\ntelescope with a low magnifying power, but are too scattered for an\r\ninstrument of any size to be effective upon them. The finest of all\r\nirregular star-clusters is that known as the Sword-handle of Perseus.\r\nMidway between Perseus and the W of Cassiopeia, and directly in the\r\nline of the Galaxy, the eye discerns a small, hazy patch of light,\r\nof which even a 2 or 3 inch glass will make a beautiful object, while\r\nwith a large aperture its splendour is extraordinary. It consists\r\nof two groups of stars which are both in the same field with a small\r\ninstrument and low powers. Towards the edge of the field the stars\r\nare comparatively sparsely scattered; but towards the two centres of\r\ncondensation the thickness of grouping steadily increases. Altogether\r\nthere is no more impressive stellar object than this magnificent\r\ndouble cluster (Plate XXVIII., 2). Another very fine example of\r\nthe irregular type of grouping is seen in M. 35, situated in the\r\nconstellation Gemini, and forming an obtuse-angled triangle with the\r\nstars Mu and Eta Geminorum (Plate XXVIII., 1). There are many other\r\nsimilar groups fairly well within the reach of comparatively small\r\ninstruments, and some of these are mentioned in the list of objects\r\n(Appendix II.).\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable than the irregular clusters are those which\r\ncondense into a more or less globular form. There are not very\r\nmany objects of this class in the northern sky visible with a small\r\ntelescope, but the beauty of those which are visible is very notable.\r\nThe most splendid of all is the famous cluster M. 13 Herculis. (The\r\nM. in these cases refers to the catalogue of such objects drawn up by\r\nMessier, the French 'comet ferret,' to guide him in his labours.) M.\r\n13 is situated almost on the line between Zeta and Eta Herculis,\r\nand at about two-thirds of the distance from Zeta towards Eta. It is\r\nfaintly visible to the unaided eye when its place is known, and,\r\nwhen viewed with sufficient telescopic power, is a very fine object.\r\nNichol's remark that 'perhaps no one ever saw it for the first time\r\nthrough a large telescope without uttering a shout of wonder' seems\r\nto be based on a somewhat extravagant estimate of the enthusiasm and\r\ndemonstrativeness of the average star-gazer; but the cluster is a very\r\nnoble object all the same, consisting, according to a count made on a\r\nnegative taken in 1899, of no fewer than 5,482 stars, which condense\r\ntowards the centre into a mass of great brilliancy. It takes a large\r\naperture to resolve the centre of the cluster into stars, but even a\r\n3-inch will show a number of twinkling points of light in the outlying\r\nstreamers (Plate XXIX.). In the same constellation will also be found\r\nthe cluster M. 92, similar to, but somewhat fainter than M. 13; and\r\nother globular clusters are noted in the Appendix. Most of these\r\nobjects, however, can only be seen after a fashion with small\r\ninstruments. Of the true nature and condition of these wonderful\r\naggregations we are so far profoundly ignorant. The question of\r\nwhether they are composed of small stars, situated at no very great\r\ndistance from the earth, or of large bodies, which are rendered faint\r\nto our vision by immense distance, has been frequently discussed. Gore\r\nconcludes that they are 'composed of stars of average size and mass,\r\nand that the faintness of the component stars is simply due to their\r\nimmense distance from the earth.' If so, the true proportions of some\r\nof these clusters must be indeed phenomenal! A very remarkable feature\r\nto be noticed in connection with some of them is the high proportion\r\nof variable stars which they contain. Professor Bailey has found that\r\nin such clusters as M. 3 and M. 5 the proportion of variables is one\r\nin seven and one in eleven respectively, while several other groups\r\nshow proportions ranging from one in eighteen up to one in sixty.\r\nAs the general proportion of variables is somewhere about one in a\r\nhundred, these ratios are remarkable. They only characterize a certain\r\nnumber of clusters, however, and are absent in cases which seem\r\nstrictly parallel to others where they exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXIX.\r\n\r\nCluster M. 13 Herculis. Photographed by Mr. W. E. Wilson.]\r\n\r\nWe now pass from the star-clusters to the nebulæ properly so called.\r\nTill after the middle of last century it was an open question whether\r\nthere was any real distinction between the two classes of bodies.\r\nHerschel had suggested the existence of a 'shining fluid,' distributed\r\nthrough space, whose condensations gave rise to those objects known\r\nas nebulæ; but it was freely maintained by many that the objects which\r\ncould not be resolved into stars were irresolvable only because of\r\ntheir vast distance, and that the increase of telescopic power would\r\nresult in the disclosure of their stellar nature. This view seemed to\r\nbe confirmed when it was confidently announced that the great Rosse\r\ntelescope had effected the resolution of the Orion Nebula, which was\r\nlooked upon as being in some sort a test case. But the supposed proof\r\nof the stellar character of nebulæ did not hold its ground for long,\r\nfor in 1864 Sir William Huggins, on applying the spectroscope to the\r\nplanetary nebula in Draco, found that its spectrum consisted merely\r\nof bright lines, one of which--the most conspicuous--was close to the\r\nposition of a nitrogen line, but has proved to be distinct from it;\r\nwhile of the other two, one was unmistakably the F line of hydrogen\r\nand the other remains still unidentified. Thus it became immediately\r\nmanifest that the nebula in Draco did not consist of distant stars,\r\nbut was of gaseous constitution; and Sir William Herschel's idea of\r\nthe existence of non-stellar matter in the universe was abundantly\r\njustified. Subsequent research has proved that multitudes of nebulæ\r\nyield a bright-line spectrum, and are therefore gaseous. Of these, by\r\nfar the most remarkable and interesting is the Great Nebula of Orion.\r\nThe observer will readily distinguish even with the unaided eye that\r\nthe middle star of the three that form the sword which hangs down from\r\nOrion's belt has a somewhat hazy appearance. A small telescope reveals\r\nthe fact that the haziness is due to the presence of a great misty\r\ncloud of light, in shape something like a fish-mouth, and of a\r\ngreenish colour. At the junction of the jaws lies the multiple star\r\nTheta Orionis, which with a 2- or 3-inch glass appears to consist of\r\nfour stars--'the trapezium'--large instruments showing in addition two\r\nvery faint stars.\r\n\r\nWith greater telescopic power additional features begin to reveal\r\nthemselves; the mist immediately above the trapezium assumes a roughly\r\ntriangular shape, and is evidently much denser than the rest of\r\nthe nebula, presenting a curdled appearance similar to that of the\r\nstretches of small cloud in a 'mackerel' sky; while from the upper\r\njaw of the fish-mouth a great shadowy horn rises and stretches upward,\r\nuntil it gradually loses itself in the darkness of the background.\r\nThis wonderful nebula appears to have been discovered in 1618, but was\r\nfirst really described and sketched by Huygens in 1656, since when it\r\nhas been kept under the closest scrutiny, innumerable drawings of\r\nit having been made and compared from time to time with the view of\r\ndetecting any traces of change. The finest drawings extant are those\r\nof Sir John Herschel and Mr. Lassell, and the elaborate one made with\r\nthe help of the Rosse 6-foot mirror.\r\n\r\nDrawing, however, at no time a satisfactory method of representing the\r\nshadowy and elusive forms of nebulæ, has now been entirely superseded\r\nby the work of the sensitive plate. Common, Roberts, Pickering, and\r\nothers have succeeded admirably in photographing the Great Nebula with\r\nexposures ranging from half an hour up to six hours. The extension\r\nof nebulous matter revealed by these photographs is enormous (Plate\r\nXXX.), so much so that many of the central features of the nebula\r\nwith which the eye is familiar are quite masked and overpowered in\r\nthe photographic print. The spectrum of the Orion Nebula exhibits\r\nindications of the presence of hydrogen and helium, as well as the\r\ncharacteristic green ray which marks the unknown substance named\r\n'nebulium.'\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this 'tumultuous cloud, instinct with fire and\r\nnitre,' is always amazing. Sir Robert Ball considers it one of the\r\nthree most remarkable objects visible in the northern heavens,\r\nthe other two being Saturn and the Great Cluster in Hercules. But,\r\nbeautiful and wonderful as both of these may be, the Orion Nebula\r\nconveys to the mind a sense of mystery which the others, in spite of\r\ntheir extraordinary features, never suggest. Absolutely staggering\r\nis the thought of the stupendous dimensions of the nebula. Professor\r\nPickering considers its parallax to be so small as to indicate a\r\ndistance of not less than 1,000 years light journey from our earth! It\r\nis almost impossible to realize the meaning of such a statement. When\r\nwe look at this shining mist, we are seeing it, not as it is now, but\r\nas it was more than a hundred years before the Norman Conquest; were\r\nit blotted out of existence now, it would still shine to us and our\r\ndescendants for another ten centuries in virtue of the rays of light\r\nwhich are already speeding across the vast gulf that separates our\r\nworld from its curdled clouds of fire-mist, and the astronomers of\r\nA.D. 2906 might still be speculating on the nature and destiny of a\r\nthing which for ages had been non-existent! That an object should be\r\nvisible at all at such a distance demands dimensions which are really\r\nincomprehensible; but the Orion Nebula is not only visible, it is\r\nconspicuous!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXX.\r\n\r\nPhotograph of the Orion Nebula (W. H. Pickering).]\r\n\r\nThe rival of this famous nebula in point of visibility is the\r\nwell-known spiral in the girdle of Andromeda. On a clear night it can\r\neasily be seen with the naked eye near the star Nu Andromedæ, and may\r\nreadily be, as it has often been, mistaken for a comet. Its discovery\r\nmust, therefore, have been practically coincident with the beginnings\r\nof human observation of the heavens; but special mention of it does\r\nnot occur before the tenth century of our era. A small telescope will\r\nshow it fairly well, but it must be admitted that the first view is\r\napt to produce a feeling of disappointment. The observer need not look\r\nfor anything like the whirling streams of light which are revealed on\r\nmodern long exposure photographs (Plate XXXI., 1). He will see what\r\nSimon Marius so aptly described under the simile of 'the light\r\nseen from a great distance through half-transparent horn plates'--a\r\nlens-shaped misty light, brightening very rapidly towards a nucleus\r\nwhich seems always on the point of coming to definition but is\r\nnever defined, and again fading away without traceable boundary into\r\nobscurity on every side. The first step towards an explanation of the\r\nstructure of this curious object was made by Bond in the middle of\r\nlast century. With the 15-inch refractor of the Cambridge (U.S.A.)\r\nObservatory, he detected two dark rifts running lengthwise through the\r\nbright matter of the nebula; but it was not till 1887 and 1888 that\r\nits true form was revealed by Roberts's photographs. It was then seen\r\nto be a gigantic spiral or whirlpool, the rifts noticed by Bond being\r\nthe lines of separation between the huge whorls of the spiral. Of\r\ncourse, small instruments are powerless to reveal anything of this\r\nwonderful structure; still there is an interest in being able to see,\r\nhowever imperfectly, an object which seems to present to our eyes the\r\nembodiment of that process by which some assume that our own system\r\nmay have been shaped. So far as the powers of the best telescopes go,\r\nthe Andromeda Nebula presents no appearance of stellar constitution.\r\nIts spectrum, according to Scheiner, is continuous, which would imply\r\nthat in spite of appearances it is in reality composed of stars; but\r\nSir William Huggins has seen also bright lines in it. Possibly it may\r\nrepresent a stage intermediate between the stellar and the gaseous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXXI.\r\n\r\n  1. [North.]\r\n\r\n  2.

Spiral in Triangulum (M. 33).\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable example of a spiral nebula will be found in M. 51.\r\nIt is situated in the constellation Canes Venatici, and may be easily\r\npicked up, being not far from the end star of the Plough-handle Eta\r\nUrsæ Majoris. This strange object, 'gyre on gyre' of fire-mist, was\r\none of the first spirals to have its true character demonstrated by\r\nthe Rosse telescope. It is visible with moderate optical powers, but\r\ndisplays to them none of that marvellous structure which the great\r\n6-foot mirror revealed for the first time, and which has been amply\r\nconfirmed by subsequent photographic evidence (Plate XXXII.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\nPhotograph of Whirlpool Nebula (M. 51). Taken by Mr. W. E. Wilson,\r\nMarch 6, 1897.]\r\n\r\nAmong other classes of nebulæ we can only mention the ring and the\r\nplanetary. Of each of these, one good example can be seen, though,\r\nit must be admitted, not much more than seen, with very modest\r\ninstrumental equipment. Midway between the two stars Beta and Gamma\r\nLyræ, already referred to in connection with the variability of the\r\nformer, the observer by a little fishing will find the famous Ring\r\nNebula of Lyra. With low powers it appears simply as a hazy oval spot;\r\nbut it bears magnifying moderately well, and its annular shape comes\r\nout fairly with a power of eighty on a 2-1/2 inch, though it can\r\nscarcely be called a brilliant object with that aperture, or indeed\r\nwith anything much under 8 inches. None the less, it is of great\r\ninterest, the curious symmetry of this gaseous ring making it an\r\nalmost unique object. It resembles nothing so much as those vortex\r\nrings which an expert smoker will sometimes send quivering through the\r\nair. Photographs show clearly a star within the ring, and this\r\nstar has a very curious history, having been frequently visible in\r\ncomparatively small telescopes, and again, within a year or two,\r\ninvisible in much larger ones. Photography seems to have succeeded\r\nin persuading it to forgo these caprices, though it presents\r\npeculiarities of light which are still unexplained. The actinic plate\r\nreveals also very clearly that deficiency of light at the ends of the\r\nlonger diameter of the ring which can be detected, though with more\r\ndifficulty, by the eye. The class of annular nebulæ is not a large\r\none, and none of its other members come within the effective range of\r\nsmall instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanetary nebulæ are so called because with ordinary powers they\r\npresent somewhat of the appearance of a planet seen very dimly and\r\nconsiderably out of focus. The appearance of uniformity in their\r\nboundaries vanishes under higher telescopic power, and they appear to\r\nbe generally decidedly elliptical; they yield a gaseous spectrum with\r\nstrong evidence of the presence of 'nebulium,' the unknown substance\r\nwhich gives evidence of its presence in the spectrum of every true\r\nnebula, and has, so far (with one doubtful exception) been found\r\nnowhere else. The chief example of the class is that body in Draco\r\nwhich first yielded to Huggins the secret of the gaseous nature of the\r\nnebulæ. It lies nearly half-way between Polaris and Gamma Draconis,\r\nand is described by Webb as a 'very luminous disc, much like a\r\nconsiderable star out of focus.' It is by no means a striking object,\r\nbut has its own interest as the first witness to the true nature of\r\nthat great class of heavenly bodies to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe multitude of nebulous bodies scattered over the heavens may be\r\njudged from the fact that Professor Keeler, after partial surveys\r\ncarried out by means of photography with the Crossley reflector, came\r\nto the conclusion that the number within the reach of that instrument\r\n(36-inch aperture) might be put down at not less than 120,000. It is\r\na curious fact that the grouping of this great multitude seems to\r\nbe fundamentally different from that of the stars. Where stars are\r\ndensely scattered, nebulæ are comparatively scarce; where nebulæ\r\nabound, the stars are less thickly sown. So much is this the case,\r\nthat, when Herschel in his historic 'sweeps' of the heavens came\r\nacross a notably starless region, he used to call out to his assistant\r\nto 'prepare for nebulæ.' The idea of a physical connection between the\r\ntwo classes of bodies is thus underlined in a manner which, as Herbert\r\nSpencer saw so early as 1854, is quite unmistakable.\r\n\r\nThere remain one or two questions of which the very shortest notice\r\nmust suffice--not because they are unimportant, but because their\r\nimportance is such that any attempt at adequate discussion of them is\r\nimpossible in our limited space. One of these inevitably rises to the\r\nmind in presence of the myriads of the heavenly host--the familiar\r\nquestion which was so pleasingly suggested to our growing minds by the\r\nnursery rhyme of our childhood. To the question, What is a star? it\r\nhas now become possible to give an answer which is satisfactory so\r\nfar as it goes, though it is in a very rudimentary stage as regards\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has taught us that the stars consist of incandescent\r\nsolid bodies, or of masses of incandescent gas so large and dense\r\nas not to be transparent; and further, that they are surrounded by\r\natmospheres consisting of gases cooler than themselves. The nature of\r\nthe substances incandescent in the individual bodies has also to some\r\nextent been learned. The result has been to show that, while there is\r\nconsiderable variety in the chemical constitution and condition of the\r\nstars, at least five different types being recognised, each capable\r\nof more minute subdivision, the stars are, in the main, composed\r\nof elements similar to those existing in the sun; and, in Professor\r\nNewcomb's words, 'as the sun contains most of the elements found on\r\nthe earth and few or no others, we may say that earth and stars seem\r\nto be all made out of like matter.' It is, of course, impossible to\r\nsay what unknown elements may exist in the stars; but at least it\r\nis certain that many substances quite familiar to us, such as iron,\r\nmagnesium, calcium, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, are present in\r\ntheir constitution. Indeed, our own sun, in spite of its overwhelming\r\nimportance to ourselves is to be regarded, relatively to the stellar\r\nmultitudes, as merely one star among many; nor, so far as can be\r\njudged, can it be considered by any means a star of the first class.\r\nThere can be no doubt that, if removed to the average distance of\r\nfirst magnitude stars--thirty-three years light journey--our sun would\r\nbe merely a common-place member of the heavenly host, far outshone by\r\nmany of its fellow-suns. In all probability it would shine as about a\r\nfifth magnitude star, with suspicions of variability in its light.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be noted the fact that the sun is not to be regarded\r\nas a fixed centre, its fixity being only relative to the members\r\nof its own system. With all its planets and comets it is sweeping\r\ncontinually through space with a velocity of more than 1,000,000 miles\r\nin the twenty-four hours. This remarkable fact was first suspected\r\nby Sir William Herschel, who also, with that insight which was\r\ncharacteristic of his wonderful genius, saw, and was able roughly\r\nto apply, the method which would either confirm or disprove the\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe principle which lies at the bottom of the determination is in\r\nitself simple enough, though its application is complicated in such a\r\nmanner as to render the investigation a very difficult one. A wayfarer\r\npassing up the centre of a street lighted on both sides by lamps will\r\nsee that the lamps in front of him appear to open out and separate\r\nfrom one another as he advances, while those that he is leaving behind\r\nhim have an opposite motion, appearing to close in upon one another.\r\nNow, with regard to the solar motion, if the case were absolutely\r\nsimple, the same effect would be produced upon the stars among which\r\nwe are moving; that is to say, were the stars absolutely fixed, and\r\nour system alone in motion among them, there would appear to be a\r\ngeneral thinning out or retreating of the stars from the point towards\r\nwhich the sun is moving, and a corresponding crowding together of them\r\ntowards the point, directly opposite in the heavens, from which it is\r\nreceding. In actual fact the case is not by any means so simple, for\r\nthe stars are not fixed; they have motions of their own, some of\r\nthem enormously greater than the motion of the sun. Thus the apparent\r\nmotion caused by the advance of our system is masked to a great\r\nextent by the real motion of the stars. It is plain, however, that the\r\nperspective effect of the sun's motion must really be contained in the\r\ntotal motion of each star, or, in other words, that each star, along\r\nwith its own real motion, must have an apparent motion which is common\r\nto all, and results from our movement through space. If this common\r\nelement can be disentangled from the individual element, the proper\r\nmotion of each star, then the materials for the solution of the\r\nproblem will be secured. It has been found possible to effect this\r\ndisentanglement, and the results of all those who have attempted the\r\nproblem are, all things considered, in remarkably close agreement.\r\n\r\nHerschel's application of his principle led him to the conclusion\r\nthat there was a tendency among the stars to widen out from the\r\nconstellation Hercules, and to crowd together towards the opposite\r\nconstellation of Argo Navis in the southern hemisphere, and the point\r\nwhich he fixed upon as the apex of the sun's path was near the star\r\nLambda Herculis. Subsequent discussions of the problem have confirmed,\r\nto a great extent, his rough estimate, which was derived from a\r\ncomparatively small number of stars. So far as general direction was\r\nconcerned, he was entirely right; the conclusion which he reached as\r\nto the exact point towards which the motion is directed has, however,\r\nbeen slightly modified by the discussion of a much larger number of\r\nstars, and it is now considered that the apex of the solar journey 'is\r\nin the general direction of the constellation Lyra, and perhaps near\r\nthe star Vega, the brightest of that constellation' (Newcomb, 'The\r\nStars,' p. 91). There are but few stars more beautiful and interesting\r\nthan Vega; to its own intrinsic interest must now be added that\r\narising from the fact that each successive night we look upon it we\r\nhave swept more than 1,000,000 miles nearer to its brilliant globe,\r\nand that with every year we have lessened, by some 400,000,000 miles,\r\nthe distance that divides us from it. There can surely be no thought\r\nmore amazing than this! It seems to gather up and bring to a focus\r\nall the other impressions of the vastness of celestial distances and\r\nperiods. So swift and ceaseless a motion, and yet the gulfs that sever\r\nus from our neighbours in space are so huge that a millennium of such\r\ninconceivable travelling makes no perceptible change upon the face of\r\nthe heavens! There rise other thoughts to the mind. Towards what goal\r\nmay our world and its companions be voyaging under the sway of the\r\nmighty ruler of the system, and at the irresistible summons of those\r\nfar-off orbs which distance reduces to the mere twinkling points of\r\nlight that in man's earliest childlike thought were but lamps hung\r\nout by the Creator to brighten the midnight sky for his favourite\r\nchildren? What strange chances may be awaiting sun and planet alike in\r\nthose depths of space towards which we are rushing with such frightful\r\nspeed? Such questions remain unanswered and unanswerable. We are as\r\nignorant of the end of our journey, and of the haps that may attend\r\nit, as we are helpless in the grasp of the forces that compel and\r\ncontrol it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Lunar Formations numbered as on the\r\nKey-map, Plate XIX.:\r\n\r\n    1.

Fifth day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list includes a number of double and multiple stars,\r\nclusters, and nebulæ, which may be fairly well seen with instruments\r\nup to 3 inches in aperture. A few objects have been added on account\r\nof their intrinsic interest, which may prove pretty severe tests. The\r\nplaces given are for 1900, and the position-angles and distances\r\nare mainly derived from Mr. Lewis's revision of Struve's 'Mensuræ\r\nMicrometricæ,' Royal Astronomical Society's Memoirs, vol. lvi., 1906.\r\nFor finding the various objects, Proctor's larger Star Atlas, though\r\nconstructed for 1880, is still, perhaps, the most generally useful.\r\nCottam's 'Charts of the Constellations' (Epoch 1890) are capital, but\r\nsomewhat expensive. A smaller set of charts will be found in Ball's\r\n'Popular Guide to the Heavens,' while Peck has also published various\r\nuseful charts. The student who wishes fuller information than that\r\ncontained in the brief notes given below should turn to Gore's\r\nexceedingly handy volume, 'The Stellar Heavens.'\r\n\r\nThe brighter stars are generally known by the letters of the Greek\r\nalphabet, prefixed to them by Bayer. When these are used up, recourse\r\nis had either to the numbers in Flamsteed's Catalogue, or to those in\r\nStruve's 'Mensuræ Micrometricæ.' The Struve numbers are preceded by\r\nthe Greek [Sigma]. A few of the more notable variable and red stars\r\nare included; these are generally marked by capital letters, as V.\r\nAQUILÆ. The order of the notes is as follows. First is given the\r\nstar's designation, then its place in hours and minutes of right\r\nascension and degrees and minutes of declination, N. and S. being\r\nmarked respectively by + and -; then follow the magnitudes; the\r\nposition-angles, which are measured in degrees from the north, or\r\nbottom point of the field, round by east, south, and west to north\r\nagain; the distances of the components from one another in seconds of\r\narc; and, finally, short notes as to colour, etc. According to Dawes,\r\none inch aperture should separate the components of a 4·56″ double\r\nstar, two inches those of a 2·28″, three those of a 1·52″, and so\r\non. If the observer's glass can do this on good nights there is little\r\nfault to find with it. Double stars may be difficult for other reasons\r\nthan the closeness of the components; thus, a faint companion to a\r\nbright star is more difficult to detect than a companion which is not\r\nfar below its primary in brightness. Clusters and nebulæ, with a\r\nfew exceptions, are apt to prove more or less disappointing in small\r\ninstruments.
