Since the year 1823, when Dr. Buckland published his famous\r\nwork, the “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,” no attempt has been made to correlate,\r\nand bring into the compass of one work, the crude mass of facts which\r\nhave been recorded in nearly every country in Europe. In this volume\r\nI have attempted to bring the history of cave-exploration down to the\r\nknowledge of to-day, and to put its main conclusions before my readers\r\nin one connected and continuous narrative. Since Dr. Buckland wrote,\r\nthe momentous discovery of human relics along with the extinct animals\r\nin caves and river deposits has revolutionised the current ideas as to\r\nthe antiquity and condition of man; and works of art of a high order,\r\nshowing a familiarity with nature and an aptitude for the delineation\r\nof the forms of animals by no means despicable, have been discovered in\r\nthe caves of Britain, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, that were the\r\ndwellings of the primeval European hunters of reindeer and mammoths.\r\nThe discoveries in Kent’s Hole and in the caves of Belgium led to those\r\nin the caves of Brixham and Wookey Hole, and finally to those of\r\nAuvergne and the south of France, as well as of Germany and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nArchæology, also, by the use of strictly inductive methods, has grown\r\nfrom a mere antiquarian speculation into a science; and its students\r\nhave proved the truth of the three divisions of human progress\r\nfamiliar to the Greek and Roman philosopher, and expressed in the\r\npages of Hesiod and Lucretius--the Ages of Stone, Bronze and Iron. The\r\nsubdivision of the first of these into the older, or palæolithic, and\r\nnewer, or neolithic, by Sir John Lubbock, is the only refinement which\r\nhas been made in this classification. Sir Charles Lyell has discussed\r\nthe various problems offered by the general consideration of the first\r\nof these divisions in “The Antiquity of Man;” while Sir John Lubbock,\r\nin “Prehistoric Man,” has followed Dr. Keller and others in working out\r\nthe past history of mankind by a comparison of the habitations, tombs,\r\nimplements and weapons found in Europe, with those of modern savages.\r\nThis work is intended to be to a considerable extent supplementary to\r\ntheirs,--to treat of the formation of caves, and of the light thrown by\r\ntheir contents on the sojourn of man in Europe, on the wild animals,\r\nand on the changes in climate and geography.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the caves of the historic period, I have given\r\nconsiderable prominence to the exploration of the Victoria Cave, near\r\nSettle, which has led to the discovery that many caverns were inhabited\r\nin this country during the fifth and sixth centuries, and that they\r\ncontain works of art of a high order. In the difficult task of bringing\r\nthem into relation with British history and art, I have to acknowledge\r\nthe kind assistance of Mr. E. A. Freeman, the Rev. J. R. Green, and Mr.\r\nA. W. Franks.\r\n\r\nIn the neolithic division of the prehistoric period, I have\r\npublished at length my recent discoveries in the sepulchral caves of\r\nDenbighshire, and am allowed by my friend, Professor Busk, to reprint\r\nhis description of the human bones. To his suggestive essay on the\r\nGibraltar caves, as well as to the works of the late Dr. Thurnam, and\r\nof Professors Broca and Huxley, I am indebted for the clue to the\r\nidentification of the neolithic dwellers in caves with the ancient\r\nIberians or Modern Basques. That portion of the evidence which relates\r\nto France I have verified by a personal examination of the human\r\nremains from caves and tombs in the Museums of Bordeaux, Toulouse,\r\nLyons and Paris.\r\n\r\nThe results of the exploration of the Hyæna-den of Wookey Hole have\r\nbeen given in greater detail in the portion of the work devoted to the\r\npalæolithic age than they would have been, had they been before fully\r\nrecorded. And in this division of the subject I have largely made\r\nuse of the “Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ,” which embodies the discoveries in\r\nAuvergne of my late friends Professor E. Lartet and Mr. Christy. To the\r\neditors of that work I am indebted for permission to use some of the\r\nplates and letterpress.\r\n\r\nThe history of the pleistocene mammalia, in which palæolithic man\r\nforms the central figure, has been my especial study for many years.\r\nAnd the evidence which is offered by the animals as to the geography\r\nand climate of Europe, which I have published from time to time in the\r\nworks of the Palæontographical Society, the _Geological Journal_, and\r\nin the _Popular Science_, _British Quarterly_, and _Edinburgh Reviews_,\r\nis collected together in this work, and brought into relation with the\r\ninquiry into the extension of ice over Europe in the glacial period,\r\nand into the soundings of the European seas. In approaching these\r\nand the like problems, I have done my best to arrive at the truth by\r\nvisiting as far as possible the foreign localities and collections, and\r\nby correspondence with the discoverers of new facts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those names which I have already mentioned, I have\r\nto express my thanks to the Councils of the Society of Antiquaries,\r\nthe Geological Society, and of the Anthropological Institute and to\r\nMr. John Evans, for the use of woodcuts; to Mr. Rooke Pennington for\r\nlooking over some of the proof sheets; and to Professors Gaudry,\r\nRütimeyer, Lortet, Nilsson, and Steenstrüp, and the Rev. Canon\r\nGreenwell for aid of various kinds. But especially do I feel grateful\r\nto my old friend and master, the late lamented Professor Phillips, for\r\nfrequent help and prudent counsel.\r\n\r\nIn laying this book before my readers I would merely further remark,\r\nthat it is a faint outline of a new and vast field of research, in\r\nwhich I have attempted to give prominence to the more important points,\r\nrather than a finished and detailed history of cave-exploration.\r\n\r\n            W. B. D.\r\n\r\n    THE OWENS COLLEGE, MANCHESTER,\r\n          _20th July, 1874_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n

in a rath at Ardagh, Limerick, and described by the Earl of\r\nDunraven (Trans. Royal Irish Acad. xxiv. Antiquities). The chalice is\r\nmade of gold, silver, bronze, brass, copper, and lead, and from the\r\nidentity of its inscription and ornament with those of Irish MSS. of\r\nascertained age, may be referred to a date ranging from the 5th to\r\nthe 9th centuries. It is also adorned with squares of blue and red\r\nenamel of the same kind as that of the brooches from the Victoria Cave,\r\nfigured in the coloured plate. The same design is also presented by\r\nthe “bronze head-ring” found in 1747 at Stitchel, in Roxburgh, (Wilson\r\n“Prehistoric Annals of Scotland,” ii. 146) as well as by one of the\r\nsilver articles known as “The Norrie Law Relics,” found in a tumulus\r\non the shore of the Bay of Largo, Firth of Forth. Of the coins found\r\nat the same place, the latest, belonging to Tiberius Constantine (d.\r\n682), fixes the date as not earlier than the 7th century. Some of\r\nthe sculptured stones of Scotland, such as the Dunnichen stone, are\r\nornamented also in the same style, and, according to Professor Wilson,\r\nbelong to “the transition period from the 4th to the 8th centuries,\r\nwhen pagan and Christian rites were obscurely mingled,” (ii. 259). In\r\nScotland, therefore, as well as Ireland, this style of ornamentation\r\nis of the same age, corresponding in the main with that of Brit-Welsh\r\narticles in the Victoria Cave, proved by the associated coins to be\r\nlater than the 4th century.\r\n\r\nPage 120, line 4.--These teeth are considered by Dr. Leith Adams to\r\nbelong to _Elephas antiquus_, which has been discovered in other places\r\nin Yorkshire. They may possibly belong to that animal; but they may,\r\nwith equal justice, be identified with the wide-plated variety of the\r\nteeth of the Mammoth. The great variation in the width of the component\r\nplates of the fossil teeth of Mammoth observable in the large series\r\nfrom Crayford and the caves of the Mendip Hills, and in those in the\r\nmagnificent Museum of Lyons, causes me to hesitate in considering them\r\nto belong to the rarer species.\r\n\r\nPage 130, line 2.--This has been verified while these sheets were\r\npassing through the press by the discovery of Brit-Welsh articles in\r\na cave in Kirkcudbrightshire by Messrs. A. R. Hunt and A. J. Corrie,\r\namong which are bone fasteners similar in outline to that from the\r\nVictoria Cave (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nPage 190.--In using this classification of crania, I have purposely\r\nattached higher value to the two extremes of skull form, or the long\r\nand the broad, than to the intermediate oval forms, which cannot be\r\nviewed as distinctive of race, because they may be the results either\r\nof the intermarriage of a long-headed with a short-headed people, or of\r\nvariation from the type of one or other of them.\r\n\r\nPage 196, heading, _for_ “Dolicho-cepha” _read_ “Dolicho-cephali.”\r\n\r\nPage 201, heading, _dele_ “A”.\r\n\r\nPage 213, note 2.--The “tête annulaire,” or annular depression, is\r\nalso visible on some of the broad as well as the long skulls from\r\na “Merovingian” cemetery at Chelles in the same collection. The\r\nassociation in this cemetery of the two skull-forms is probably due to\r\nthe Merovingians being the masters, and the Celts the servants, and the\r\nconquerors and the vanquished being buried in the same spot.\r\n\r\nPage 220, line 24, _for_ “Volscæ” _read_ “Volcæ.”\r\n\r\nPage 223, line 25, _for_ “east” _read_ “west.”\r\n\r\nPage 228, line 3, _dele_ “that.”\r\n\r\nPage 229, line 3, _for_ “set foot” _read_ “settled.” The statement in\r\nthe text is too strong.

In the Roman\r\nMythology, they were the abode of the Sibyls, and of the nymphs, and\r\nin Greece they were the places where Pan, Bacchus, Pluto, and the Moon\r\nwere worshipped, and where the oracles were delivered, as at Delphi,\r\nCorinth, and Mount Cithæron; in Persia they were connected with the\r\nobscure worship of Mithras. Their names, in many cases, are survivals\r\nof the superstitious ideas of antiquity. In France and Germany they are\r\nfrequently termed “Fairy, Dragons’, or Devils’ Caves,” and, according\r\nto M. Desnoyers, they are mentioned in the invocation of certain\r\ncanonized anchorites, who dwelt in them after having dispossessed and\r\ndestroyed the dragons and serpents, the pagan superstition appearing in\r\na Christian dress.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages they were looked upon as the dwellings of evil\r\nspirits, into the unfathomable abysses of which the intruder was lured\r\nto his own destruction. Long after the fairies and little men had\r\nforsaken the forests and glens of Northern Germany, they dwelt in their\r\npalaces deep in the hearts of the mountains,--in “the dwarf holes,” as\r\nthey were called--whence they came, from time to time, into the upper\r\nair. Near Elbingrode, for example, in the Hartz, the legend was current\r\nin the middle of the last century, that when a wedding-dinner was being\r\nprepared the near relations of the bride and bridegroom went to the\r\ncaves, and asked the dwarfs for copper and brass kettles, pewter dishes\r\nand plates, and other kitchen utensils.[1] “Then they retired a little,\r\nand when they came back, found everything they desired set ready for\r\nthem at the mouth of the cave. When the wedding was over they returned\r\nwhat they had borrowed, and in token of gratitude, offered some meat to\r\ntheir benefactors.” Allusions, such as this, to dwarfs, according to\r\nProfessor Nilsson, point back to the remote time when a small primeval\r\nrace, inhabiting Northern Germany, was driven by invaders to take\r\nrefuge in caverns,--a view that derives support from the fact that in\r\nScandinavia the tall Northmen were accustomed to consider the smaller\r\nLapps and Finns as dwarfs, and to invest them with magic power, just\r\nas in Palestine the smaller invading peoples considered their tall\r\nenemies giants. The cave of Bauman’s hole, also in the Hartz district,\r\nwas said, in the middle of the last century, to have been haunted\r\nby divers apparitions, and to contain a treasure guarded by black\r\nmastiffs; and in Burrington Combe, in Somersetshire, some twenty years\r\nago, a cave was dug out by a working man, under the impression that it\r\ncontained gold. The hills of Granada are still believed, by the Moorish\r\nchildren, to contain the great Boabdil and his sleeping host, who will\r\nawake when an adventurous mortal invades their repose, and will issue\r\nforth to restore the glory of the Moorish kings.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, no wonder that legends and poetical fancies such as\r\nthese should cluster round caves, for the gloom of their recesses,\r\nand the shrill drip of the water from the roof, or the roar of the\r\nsubterranean water-falls echoing through the passages, and the white\r\nbosses of stalagmite looming like statues through the darkness, offer\r\nample materials for the use of a vivid imagination. The fact that\r\noften their length was unknown, naturally led to the inference that\r\nthey were passages into another world. And this is equally true of\r\nthe story of Boabdil, of that of the Purgatory of St. Patrick, in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and of the course of the river Styx, which sinks\r\ninto the rocks and flows through a series of caverns that are the dark\r\nentrance-halls of Hades. The same idea is evident in the remarkable\r\nstory, related by Ælian (Lib. xvi. 16). “Among the Indians of Areia\r\nthere is an abyss sacred to Pluto, and beneath it vast galleries,\r\nand hidden passages and depths, that have never been fathomed. How\r\nthese are formed the Indians tell not, nor shall I attempt to relate.\r\nThe Indians drive thither (every year) more than 3,000 different\r\nanimals--sheep, goats, oxen, and horses--and each acting either from\r\ndread of the dreadful abyss, or to avert an evil omen in proportion to\r\nhis means, seeks his own and his family’s safety by causing the animals\r\nto tumble in; and these, neither bound with chains nor driven, of their\r\nown accord finish their journey as if led on by some charm; and after\r\nthey have come to the mouth of the abyss they willingly leap down, and\r\nare never more seen by mortal eyes. The lowing, however, of the cattle,\r\nthe bleating of the sheep and of the goats, and the whinnying of the\r\nhorses are heard above ground, and if anyone listen at the mouth, he\r\nwill hear sounds of this kind lasting for a long time. Nor do they ever\r\ncease, because beasts are driven thither every day. But whether the\r\nsound is made by those recently driven in, or by some of those driven\r\nin some time before, I do not express an opinion.” The Roman Catholic\r\nChurch took advantage of this feeling of superstitious awe, as late as\r\nthe Middle Ages. At the time of the Reformation it was believed that a\r\ncave at Bishofferode would prove the death of some person in the course\r\nof the year, unless a public yearly atonement were made. Accordingly\r\na priest came, on a certain day, to the chapel on the hill opposite,\r\nwhence he passed in solemn procession to the cave, “and let down into\r\nit a crucifix, which he pulled up again, and took this occasion to\r\nremind them of hell, and to avoid the punishment due to their sins.”\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the interiors of some of the caves could not fail to give\r\nrise to more graceful fancies than these. The fantastic shapes of the\r\ndripstone, with which they are adorned, now resembling Gothic pillars\r\nsupporting a crystalline arcade, or jutting out in little spires and\r\nminarets, and very generally covering the floor with a marble-like\r\npavement, and in some cases lining the pools of water with a fretwork\r\nof crystals that shine like the facets of a diamond, were fitting\r\nornaments for the houses of unearthly beings, such as fairies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Physical Division of the Subject._\r\n\r\nIt is by no means my intention in this work to give a history of\r\nlegends such as these, but to take my readers with me into some of\r\nthe more important and more beautiful caves in this country. The\r\nexploration of the chambers and passages of which they are composed,\r\nthe fording of the subterranean streams by which they are frequently\r\ntraversed, or the descent into deep chasms which open in their floors,\r\nhave the peculiar charm of mountaineering, not without a certain\r\npleasurable amount of risk. But to physicist and geologist they offer\r\nfar more than this. They give an insight into the wonderful chemistry\r\nby which changes are being wrought, at the present time, in the solid\r\nrock. Nor are the conclusions to which we are led by the investigation\r\nof these chemical changes merely confined to the interior of caves.\r\nThey enable us to understand how some of the most beautiful scenery\r\nin Europe has been formed, and to realize the mode by which all\r\nprecipices and gorges have been carved out of the calcareous rock. In\r\nthe next chapter we shall see why it is that the combination of hill\r\nand valley, ravine and precipice, present the same general features in\r\nall limestone districts--why, for instance, the ravines of Palestine\r\nare the same as those of Greece, and both are identical with those\r\nin Yorkshire. The origin and the history of caves will be examined,\r\nas well as their relation to the general physical geography of the\r\ncalcareous strata. All these subjects are comprehended in the first or\r\nthe physical division of cave-hunting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Biological Division._\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to the definition of the scope and object of the\r\nsecond, or Biological, division of the subject.\r\n\r\nCaves have been used by man, and the domestic animals living under his\r\nprotection, from the earliest times recorded by history down to the\r\npresent day. Those penetrating the rugged precipices of Palestine,\r\nwe read in the Old Testament, served both for habitation and for\r\nburial, and, from the notices which are scattered through the early\r\nGreek writers, we may conclude that those of Greece were used for\r\ndwelling-places. The story of the Cyclops proves that they were also\r\nused as folds for goats. The name of Troglodytes, given to many peoples\r\nof the most remote antiquity, implies that there was a time in the\r\nhistory of mankind when Pliny’s statement “specus erat pro domibus”\r\nwas strictly true (“Hist. Nat.” I. v. c. 56). The caves of Africa\r\nhave been places of retreat from the remotest antiquity down to the\r\nFrench conquest of Algeria, and in 1845 several hundred Arabs were\r\nsuffocated in those of Dahra by the smoke of a fire kindled at the\r\nentrance by Marshal (then Colonel) Pelissier. Dr. Livingstone alludes\r\nin his recent letters to the vast caves of Central Africa, which\r\noffer refuge to whole tribes with their cattle and household stuff.\r\nIn France, according to M. Desnoyers, there are at the present time\r\nwhole villages, including the church, to be found in the rock, which\r\nare merely caves modified, extended, and altered by the hand of man.\r\nThe caves of the Dordogne were inhabited in the middle ages. Floras\r\nwrites that the Aquitani, “callidum genus in speluncas se recipiebant,\r\nCæsar jussit includi,”[2] and the same caves afforded shelter to the\r\ninhabitants of the same region in the wars of King Pepin against\r\nthe last Duke of Aquitaine. In this country a small cave in Cheddar\r\nPass was occupied till within the last few years. The caves in the\r\nnorthern counties are stated by Gildas to have offered a refuge to\r\nthe Brit-Welsh inhabitants of Britain during the raids of the Picts\r\nand Scots; and in the year 1745 those of Yorkshire were turned to the\r\nsame purpose during the invasion of the Pretender. We might reasonably\r\nexpect to find in caves turned to these uses objects left behind, which\r\nwould tell us something of the manners and customs of their possessors,\r\nand light up the catalogue of battles and intrigues of which history\r\ngenerally consists. The results obtained from the Brit-Welsh group of\r\ncaves, treated in the third chapter, show that this hitherto neglected\r\nbranch of the inquiry is not without value to the historian.\r\n\r\nCaves containing remains of this kind may be conveniently termed\r\nhistoric, because they may be brought into relation with history. It\r\nmust, however, be carefully remarked that the term does not relate\r\nto history _in general_, but to that _in particular_ of each country\r\nwhich happens to be under investigation. The misapprehension of\r\nthis has caused great confusion, and many mistakes in archæological\r\nclassification and reasoning.\r\n\r\nAgain, our experience of the habits of rude and uncivilized peoples\r\nwould naturally lead us to look to caves, as the places in which we\r\nshould be likely to meet with the remains of the men who lived in\r\nEurope before the dawn of history. Such remains we do find that,\r\nplaced side by side with others from the tombs and dwellings, enable\r\nus to discover some, at least, of the races who lived in Europe\r\nin long-forgotten times, and to ascertain roughly the sequence of\r\nevents in the remote past, far away from the historical border. It\r\nmay, indeed, seem a hopeless quest to recover what has been buried\r\nin oblivion so long, and it is successful merely through the careful\r\ncomparison of the human skeletons in the caves and tombs of Britain,\r\nFrance, and Spain, with those of existing races, and of the implements\r\nand weapons with those which are now used among savage tribes. By this\r\nmeans we shall see that there are good grounds for extending the range\r\nof the Iberian people over a considerable area in Europe, and for\r\nthe belief that the Eskimos once lived as far south as Auvergne. In\r\ndiscussing both these problems it will be impossible to shut our eyes\r\nto the continuity that exists between geology, archæology, biology, and\r\nhistory--sciences which at first sight appear isolated from each other.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the domestic animals in the caves will necessarily lead to\r\nthe further examination of the appearance and disappearance of breeds\r\nunder the care of man. And this complicated question has an important\r\nbearing not merely on the ethnology, but also on the history, of some\r\nof the European peoples. It must be admitted, however, that this\r\nbranch of the subject is, as yet, known merely in outline, and we can\r\nonly hope to ascertain a few facts which may form a basis for future\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view the contents of caves are peculiarly\r\nvaluable. They have been used as places of shelter, not merely by man,\r\nbut by wild animals, from the time they first became accessible to\r\nthe present day. In the same way, therefore, as now they contain, in\r\ntheir superficial layers, the bones of sheep, oxen, and horses, foxes,\r\nrabbits, and badgers, so in their deeper strata lie buried the remains\r\nof the animals which were living in Europe long before the historic\r\ntimes. In other words, they enable us to make out the groups of animals\r\ninhabiting the neighbouring districts, and which in many cases have\r\neither forsaken their original abodes or have become extinct. And since\r\nthose which are extinct, or which have migrated, could not have lived\r\nwhere their remains are found under the present conditions of life, an\r\ninquiry into their history leads us into the general question of the\r\nancient European climate and geography. It is obvious, for example,\r\nthat the spotted hyæna, which formerly inhabited the caves of Sicily,\r\ncould not have crossed over to that island after it was separated from\r\nAfrica and Italy; and it would be impossible for the musk-sheep, the\r\nmost arctic of the herbivora, to live as far south as Auvergne under\r\nthe present climatal conditions. The presence, therefore, of these\r\nanimals in these districts is proof in the one case of a geographical,\r\nand in the other of a climatal, change.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of all these questions is comprehended under the second,\r\nor biological, division of cave-hunting, which may be defined as an\r\ninquiry into the remains of man and animals found in the caves, and\r\ninto the conditions under which they lived in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The three Classes of Bone-caves._\r\n\r\nIn the biological branch of the subject the caves will be treated\r\nfirst which are comprehended within the limits of history; then we\r\nshall pass on to the investigation of Prehistoric caves, or those\r\nwhich have been inhabited in the interval that separates history from\r\nthe remote geological era, which is characterized by the existence of\r\nthe extinct mammalia in Europe. And, lastly, those will be examined\r\nwhich have furnished the remains of the extinct animals, and which\r\nare termed by the geologists Pleistocene, from the fact that a larger\r\npercentage of existing species were then living than in the preceding\r\nPleio-, Meio-, and Eocene periods. The equivalent terms “Quaternary,”\r\nused by many French geologists, and the “Post-pleiocene division of the\r\nPost-tertiary Formation,” used by Sir Charles Lyell, are not adopted\r\nin this work, because they imply a break in the continuity of life,\r\nwhich does not exist. “Pleistocene” was invented and subsequently\r\ndiscarded by Sir C. Lyell,[3] and is at present used by many eminent\r\nwriters, such as Forbes, Phillips, Gervais, and others. The ossiferous\r\ncaves will therefore be divided into the Historic, Prehistoric, and\r\nPleistocene groups. And it will be more convenient to work backwards\r\nin time from the basis offered by history, than to begin with the\r\nPleistocene, or oldest division, and bring the narrative down to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThis classification, founded in part on the principle of change\r\nin the animal world, and partly on the basis offered by history,\r\ncoincides, only in part, with that of the archæologists based on the\r\nremains of man’s handiwork. The Pleistocene age is the equivalent of\r\nthe Palæolithic, or that of rude unpolished stone; the Prehistoric\r\nrepresents the ages of polished stone, bronze, and iron in part, or\r\nthose stages in human progress when the use of these materials became\r\ngeneral for the purposes of every-day life; while the Historic covers\r\nmerely the later portion of that of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n_History of Cave-Exploration in Europe._\r\n\r\n_Germany._--The rest of this chapter must be devoted to an outline of\r\nthe history of cave-exploration during the last two centuries. The\r\ndread of the supernatural, which preserved the European caves from\r\ndisturbance, was destroyed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nby the search after “ebur fossile,” or unicorn’s horn, which ranked\r\nhigh in the materia medica of those days as a specific for many\r\ndiseases, and which was obtained, in great abundance, in the caverns of\r\nthe Hartz, and in those of Hungary and Franconia. As the true nature\r\nof the drug gradually revealed itself, the German caves became famous\r\nfor the remains of the lions, hyænas, fossil elephants, and other\r\nstrange animals, which had been used for medicine. We owe the first\r\nphilosophical discussion on the point to Dr. Gesner,[4] who, although\r\nhe maintained that the fossil unicorn consisted, in some cases, of\r\nelephant’s teeth and tusks, and in others of its fossil bones, did not\r\naltogether give up the idea of its medicinal value. It is a singular\r\nfact, that fossil remains of a similar kind are, at the present time,\r\nused by the Chinese for the same purpose, and sold in their druggists’\r\nshops.[5] The cave which was most famous at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was that of Bauman’s Hole, in the Hartz, in the district of\r\nBlankenbourg. It is noticed in the Philosophical Transactions for the\r\nyear 1662, and was subsequently described by Dr. Behrens,[6] Leibnitz,\r\nDe Luc, and Cuvier, along with others in the neighbourhood. Those of\r\nHungary come next in point of discovery, the first notice of them\r\nbeing due to Patterson Hayne in 1672. They penetrate the southern\r\nslopes of the Carpathian ranges, and are known by the name of dragons’\r\ncaves, because the bones which they contain had been considered from\r\ntime immemorial to belong to those animals by the country people.\r\nThese remains were identified by Baron Cuvier as belonging to the\r\ncave-bear.[7]\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the close of the eighteenth century that the\r\nexploring of caves was carried on systematically, or their contents\r\nexamined with any scientific precision. The caves of Franconia, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Muggendorf, were described by Esper in 1774, by\r\nRosenmuller in 1804, and six years later by Dr. Goldfuss. The most\r\nimportant was that of Gailenreuth, both from the vast quantity of\r\nremains which it was proved to contain, and the investigations to which\r\nit led. The bones of the hyæna, lion, wolf, fox, glutton, and red\r\ndeer were identified by Baron Cuvier; while some of the skulls which\r\nDr. Goldfuss obtained have been recently proved, by Professor Busk,\r\nto belong to the grizzly bear. They were associated with the bones of\r\nthe reindeer, horse and bison. Rosenmuller was of opinion that the\r\ncave had been inhabited by bears for a long series of generations; and\r\nhe thus realized that these remains proved that the animals found in\r\nthe cave had once lived in that district, and had not been swept from\r\nthe tropics by the deluge. The interest in these discoveries was at\r\nits height in the year 1816, when Dr. Buckland visited the cave, and\r\nacquired that knowledge of cave-exploring which he was subsequently\r\nto use with such good effect in this country.[8] From this time down\r\nto the present day, no new fact of importance has been added to our\r\nknowledge of caves by explorations in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Britain._--The first bone-cave systematically explored in\r\nthis country was that discovered by Mr. Whidbey,[9] in the Devonian\r\nlimestone at Oreston, near Plymouth, in 1816; and the remains obtained\r\nfrom it were identified by Sir Everard Home as implying the existence\r\nof the rhinoceros in that region. This discovery followed close upon\r\nthe researches in Gailenreuth, and was due in some degree to the\r\nrequest which Sir Joseph Banks made, that Mr. Whidbey, in quarrying the\r\nstone for the Plymouth breakwater, should examine the contents of any\r\ncaverns that he might happen to meet with. It preceded Dr. Buckland’s\r\nexploration of Kirkdale by about four years.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1821 a cave was discovered, in a limestone quarry at\r\nKirkdale, in Yorkshire, which was found to contain bones and teeth of\r\nanimals. On hearing of the discovery, Dr. Buckland posted at once from\r\nSouth Wales to the spot, and published the result of the explorations\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions for the next year. He brought forward\r\nevidence that the cave had been inhabited by hyænas, and that the\r\nbroken and gnawed bones of the rhinoceros, mammoth, stag, bison, and\r\nhorse belonged to animals which had been dragged in for food. He also\r\nestablished the fact that all these animals had lived in Yorkshire\r\nin ancient times, and that it was impossible for the carcases of the\r\nhyæna, rhinoceros, and mammoth to have been floated from those regions\r\nwhere they are now living into the position where he found their bones.\r\nHe subsequently followed up the subject by investigating bone-caves\r\nin Derbyshire, South Wales, and Somerset, as well as in Germany, and\r\npublished his great work, “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ,” in 1822, which laid the\r\nfoundations of the new science of cave-hunting in this country. The\r\nexploration of Kirkdale followed closely upon that of Gailenreuth, and\r\nwas merely the application of those principles of research which had\r\nbeen discovered in Germany to caves in a new district.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward bone-caves were discovered in Great Britain\r\nin increasing numbers, and explored by many independent observers.\r\nThe famous cavern of Kent’s Hole, near Torquay, furnished the Rev. J.\r\nMcEnery, between 1825 and the year 1841, in which he died, with the\r\nfirst flint implements ever discovered in a cave along with the bones\r\nof extinct animals. He recognized the fact that they may be proof of\r\nthe existence of man during the time that those animals were alive;\r\nbut the scientific world was not then sufficiently educated to accept\r\nthe antiquity of the human race on the evidence brought forward, and\r\nDr. Buckland himself was so influenced by the opinions of his times,\r\nthat he refused even to entertain the idea. Although the discovery\r\nwas verified by the independent researches of Mr. Godwin Austin in\r\n1840, and by the Torquay Natural History Society in 1846, the force of\r\nprejudice was so strong, that the matter was not thought even worthy of\r\ninvestigation. Mr. McEnery’s manuscripts were lost until the year 1859,\r\nwhen an abstract of them was published by Mr. Vivian, and subsequently\r\nthey were printed in full by Mr. Pengelly, the able superintendent of\r\nthe exploration which has been carried on by a committee of the British\r\nAssociation since 1865, by whom several thousand flint implements have\r\nbeen obtained, under the conditions pointed out by the Rev. J. McEnery\r\nand Mr. Godwin Austen.[10]\r\n\r\nWhile the important question of the antiquity of man was being passed\r\nby as of no account, other caves were being examined in this country.\r\nThose of Banwell, Burrington, Sandford Hill, Bleadon, and Hutton,\r\nin the mountain limestone of the Mendip hills, were being worked by\r\nthe Rev. J. Williams and Mr. Beard, and furnished the magnificent\r\ncollection of mammalian bones now in the museum at Taunton. In North\r\nWales, also, Mr. Lloyd discovered a similar suite of bones in the\r\nlimestone caves in the neighbourhood of St. Asaph at Cefn, and in South\r\nWales numerous remains were obtained by many explorers in those of\r\nPembrokeshire and Gower.\r\n\r\nThe result of these discoveries was the proof that certain extinct\r\nanimals, such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth, had lived in\r\nthis country in ancient times, along with two other groups of species\r\nwhich are at present known only to live in hot and cold climates--the\r\nspotted hyæna and hippopotamus of Africa, with the reindeer and the\r\nmarmot of the colder regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe discovery in 1858, and the exploration, of the now famous cave\r\nof Brixham, by the Royal and Geological Societies, marked the dawn\r\nof a new era in cave-hunting. Under the careful supervision of Mr.\r\nPengelly, flint implements were discovered underneath stalagmite, and\r\nin association with the remains of the hyæna and woolly rhinoceros and\r\nmammoth, in undisturbed red loam, under conditions that prove man to\r\nhave been living in Devonshire at the same time as those animals. This\r\nsingularly opportune discovery destroyed for ever the doubts that had\r\noverhung the question of the antiquity of man, and of his co-existence\r\nin Europe in company with the animals whose remains occur both in the\r\ncaverns and river-deposits.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 M. Boucher de Perthes described certain rude flint implements\r\nthat he obtained from the fluviatile gravels of Abbeville (“Antiquités\r\nCeltiques,” vol. i.), along with the bones of extinct animals; and\r\nhis discovery was treated with the same scepticism in France as that\r\nof the Rev. J. McEnery in England, although it was verified by flint\r\nimplements being discovered, under exactly the same conditions, in the\r\ngravels of Amiens, some forty miles away, by Dr. Rigollot.[11] In the\r\nautumn of 1858, Dr. Falconer, who had been superintending the work\r\nin the Brixham cave, visited the collection made by M. de Perthes,\r\nwhile on his way to examine the caves of Sicily, and recognizing\r\nman’s handiwork in the implements, he asked his friend Mr. Prestwich\r\nto explore the Valley of the Somme. This he accordingly did, and in\r\ncompany with Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., dug out with his own hands an\r\nimplement from the undisturbed strata,[12] and thus finally settled the\r\ndisputed question. It is undoubtedly true, that scientific opinion was\r\ntending towards the acceptance of the evidence in favour of man having\r\nlived in Europe in the Pleistocene age; but the researches in Brixham\r\ncave established the fact on the highest possible authority, and\r\nconfirmed the long-neglected discoveries in the valley of the Somme.\r\nBy the end of 1859 it was fully accepted by the scientific world, and\r\ncaused the exploration of caves to be carried on with increased vigour.\r\n\r\nIn December 1859,[13] I began the exploration of the hyæna-den of\r\nWookey Hole, near Wells, Somerset, in company with the Rev. J.\r\nWilliamson, and obtained flint instruments along with the remains\r\nof the mammoth, hyæna, woolly rhinoceros, and other animals, under\r\nconditions that proved the contemporaneity of man with the extinct\r\nmammalia. And from that time down to the present date I have carried\r\non researches in caves in various parts of Great Britain. In the\r\ndistrict of Gower also, many ossiferous caverns were investigated,\r\nin 1858-9-60-1 by Colonel Wood and Dr. Falconer, and in one of them\r\nflint implements were obtained along with the bones of the extinct\r\nmammalia.[14] Kent’s Hole, begun in 1865 by the British Association,\r\nand still being worked, furnishes annually a vast number of bones\r\nand teeth of hyænas, rhinoceroses, cave-bears, and horses, and other\r\nanimals, along with flint and bone implements.[15]\r\n\r\nIn 1869 I had the good fortune to discover, and subsequently to\r\nexplore, a group of sepulchral caves in Denbighshire, which had been\r\nused by an Iberian or Basque race in the Neolithic age (Chapter V.);\r\nand in the following year the Settle Cave Committee began their work\r\nin Yorkshire under my advice. And this has led to the important\r\nconclusion, that a group of caves, extending over a wide area in the\r\ncentre and north of England, was occupied by the Brit-Welsh in the\r\nobscure interval which elapsed between the departure of the Roman\r\nlegions and the English conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_France._--The researches of Buckland into the caves of Great Britain,\r\nand of Goldfuss and others into those of Germany, and more especially\r\nthe publication of the “Ossemens Fossiles,” by Cuvier, gave an impetus\r\nto cave-exploration in France which yielded the same results as in\r\nour own country. The mammalia obtained from the cave of Fouvent (Haut\r\nSaone) in 1800 were described in the “Ossemens,” as well as those\r\nfrom Gondenans. In the Gironde, the Cave of Avison was explored by\r\nM. Billaudel in 1826-27. In the south, Marcel de Serres, aided by\r\nMM. Dubrueil and Jeanjean, examined the important Cave of Lunel-viel\r\nin 1824, and published their results in a work that holds the same\r\nposition in France as the “Reliquiæ Diluvianæ” in England. The caverns\r\nof Pondres, Souvignargues, and of Bize were explored, the two first\r\nby M. Christol in 1829, the last by M. Tournal in 1833, and those of\r\nVillefranche (Pyrénées-orient), Mialet (Gard), and Nabrigas (Lozère)\r\nwere described by De Serres in 1839, who subsequently added those of\r\nCarcas-sonne to the list in 1842. In this year MM. Prevost and J.\r\nDesnoyers explored the caves of Montmorency in the neighbourhood of\r\nParis, and described the remains discovered in those of Bicêtre. The\r\nCave of Pontil (Hérault) described by M. de Serres in 1847, was proved\r\nin 1864, by Professor Gervais, to contain two distinct strata, the\r\nneolithic lying over the palæolithic, as in Kent’s Hole.[16]\r\n\r\nIn 1860,[17] the famous Cave of Aurignac was proved, by the\r\ninvestigations of Professor Lartet, to have been inhabited by man in\r\nthe life-time of the extinct mammalia. Three years later the caves\r\nof Périgord were explored by that gentleman, along with Mr. Christy,\r\nand yielded results which mark a new era in the history of man in the\r\nremote past. From the remarkable collection of implements and weapons,\r\nthe habits and mode of life of the occupants can be ascertained with\r\ntolerable certainty, and from their comparison with the like articles\r\nnow in use among savage tribes, it may be reasonably inferred that\r\nthey were closely related in blood to the Eskimos. This most important\r\nquestion will be investigated in its proper place, in the chapter\r\nrelating to the palæolithic caves of France. Professor Lartet, M. Louis\r\nLartet, Sir Charles Lyell, and other eminent observers believe further,\r\nthat the interments that have been discovered in Aurignac and in Cro\r\nMagnon,[18] in Périgord, are to be assigned to the same relative age\r\nas the occupation of the caves by man. From the fact, however, that\r\nthe skeletons in both these cases were _above_ the strata accumulated\r\nby the palæolithic cave-dwellers, it may be concluded that they were\r\ndeposited after those strata were formed, in other words, that they are\r\nof a later age.\r\n\r\nFrom 1863 down to the present time very many caves have been explored\r\nin France without any further addition to our knowledge, excepting the\r\nverification of the facts, afforded by the caves of Brixham and of\r\nPérigord, as to the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia, and\r\nhis probable identity in race with the Eskimos.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Belgium._--The caves of Belgium[19] have afforded evidence of\r\nprecisely the same nature as those of England and France. Dr.\r\nSchmerling, of Liège, published the results of his researches, begun\r\nin 1829, into the bone-caves on the banks of the Meuse and its\r\ntributaries, in 1833-4, and proved that the mammoth, rhinoceros,\r\ncave-bear, and hyæna formerly lived in that district. He also arrived\r\nat the conclusion that man was living at that remote time, from the\r\ndiscovery of flint-flakes and human bones along with the remains\r\nof those animals in the caves of Engis and Engihoul. In 1853,[20]\r\nProfessor Spring discovered a quantity of burned, broken, and cut\r\nbones belonging to women and children, in the Cave of Chauvaux, which\r\nhe considered to imply that it had been inhabited by a family of\r\ncannibals. Axes of polished stone were also met with, that indicated\r\nthe relative age to be neolithic.\r\n\r\nTo pass over the human skeleton found in the Neanderthal Cave in 1857\r\nby Dr. Fuhlroth, which is of doubtful antiquity, the next discoveries\r\nof importance are those made by M. Dupont in the years 1864-70, in\r\nthe province of Namur, that established the fact that the same race\r\nof men who inhabited Auvergne in the palæolithic age had also lived\r\nin Belgium. M. Dupont considers that the interments in the Trou de\r\nFrontal[21] belong also to the palæolithic age, and that therefore man\r\nat that remote time was possessed of religious ideas. Before, however,\r\nthis view can be accepted, it will be necessary to show the exact\r\nrelation of the bones of the reindeer, chamois, mammoth, and other\r\nanimals found outside the slab of stone, at the mouth of the sepulchral\r\nchamber, to the human remains within. In this case, as in Aurignac\r\nand Cro Magnon, the evidence seems to me insufficient to establish so\r\nimportant a conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southern Europe._--In southern Europe the bone-caves of Sicily,\r\nworked in 1829 for the sake of the animal remains to be used in sugar\r\nrefining, were scientifically examined by Dr. Falconer in 1859; those\r\nof Malta by Captain Spratt in the same year; and those of Gibraltar by\r\nCaptain Broome in the years 1862-8. They established the existence of\r\nthe serval and the African elephant, and other characteristic African\r\nspecies, in Europe, and offer as we shall see in this work, important\r\ntestimony as to the geography of the Mediterranean area in the\r\nPleistocene age.\r\n\r\nIn this outline of the history of cave-exploration it will be seen,\r\nthat the additions to our knowledge of the past have been neither\r\nfew nor insignificant, nor in one line of inquiry. And if the\r\nattention which is now being directed to the subject be due to the\r\ngeneral development of scientific thought, it is equally true, that\r\nthe results have reacted on scientific thought in general, and have\r\nespecially benefited the sciences of geology, archæology, and history.\r\nA rich field of investigation lies before the cave-hunter, in Greece,\r\nPalestine, Lycia, Persia, and the limestone plateaux of central\r\nAsia; and since these discoveries have been so valuable in central\r\nand north-western Europe, what may we not recover from the grasp of\r\noblivion, of the infancy and early culture of mankind in the very\r\nbirth-place and “pathway of the nations”?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL HISTORY OF CAVES.\r\n\r\n  Caves formed by the Sea and by Volcanic Action.--Caves in\r\n    Arenaceous Rocks.--Caves in Calcareous Rocks of various ages.\r\n    --Their Relation to Pot-holes, “Cirques,” and Ravines.--\r\n    The Water-cave of Wookey Hole.--The Goatchurch Cave.--The\r\n    Water-caves of Derbyshire.--Of Yorkshire.--The Ingleborough\r\n    Cave.--The Rate of Deposit of Stalagmite.--The Descent into\r\n    Helln Pot.--The Caves and Pots round Weathercote.--The Formation\r\n    of Caves, Pot-holes, and Ravines.--Caverns not generally formed\r\n    in line of Faults.--Of various Ages.--Their Filling-up.--\r\n    The Cave of Caldy.--The Blackrock Cave.--Great quantity\r\n    of Carbonate of Lime dissolved by Atmospheric Water.--The\r\n    Circulation of Carbonate of Lime.--The Temperature of Caves.--\r\n    Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves formed by the Sea and by Volcanic Action._\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we shall treat of the origin of caves and of their\r\nplace in physical geography. The most obvious agent in hollowing out\r\ncaves is the sea. The set of the current, the tremendous force of the\r\nbreakers, and the grinding of the shingle, inevitably discover the weak\r\nplaces in the cliff, and leave caves as the results of their work,\r\nmodified in each case by the local conditions of the rock. Caves formed\r\nin this manner have certain characters which are easily recognized.\r\nTheir floors are very rarely much out of the horizontal, their outlook\r\nis over the sea, and they very seldom penetrate far into the cliff.\r\nA general parallelism is also to be observed in a group in the same\r\ndistrict, and their entrances are all in the same horizontal plane, or\r\nin a succession of horizontal and parallel planes. In some cases they\r\nare elevated above the present reach of the waves, and mark the line\r\nat which the sea formerly stood. From their generally inaccessible\r\nposition sea-caves have very rarely been occupied by man, and the\r\nhistory of their formation is so obvious that it requires no further\r\nnotice. Among them the famous Fingal’s Cave, off the north coast\r\nof Ireland, and that of Staffa, on the opposite shore of Scotland,\r\nhollowed out of columnar basalt, are perhaps the most remarkable in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIn volcanic regions also there are caves formed by the passage of lava\r\nto the surface of the ground, or by the imprisoned steam and gases in\r\nthe lava while it was in a molten state: but these are of comparatively\r\nlittle importance so far as relates to the general question of caves,\r\nfrom the very small areas which are occupied by active volcanoes\r\nin Europe. They have been observed in Vesuvius, Etna, Iceland, and\r\nTeneriffe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves in Arenaceous Rocks._\r\n\r\nCaves also occur sometimes in sandstones, in which case they are the\r\nresult of the erosion of the lines of the joints by the passage of\r\nsubaërial water, and if the joints happen to traverse a stratum less\r\ncompacted than the rest, the weak point is discovered, and a hollow\r\nis formed extending laterally from the original fissure. The massive\r\nmillstone grit of Derbyshire and Yorkshire present many examples of\r\nthis, as for instance in Kinderscout in the former county. The rocks\r\nat Tunbridge Wells also show to what extent the joints in the Wealden\r\nsandstones may become open fissures, more or less connected with caves,\r\non a small scale, by the mere mechanical action of water. M. Desnoyers\r\ngives instances of the same kind in the Tertiary sandstones of the\r\nParis basin, which have furnished remains of rhinoceros, reindeer,\r\nhyæna, and bear. Caverns, however, in the sandstone are rarely of\r\ngreat extent, and may be passed over as being of small importance in\r\ncomparison with those in the calcareous rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves in Calcareous Rocks of various ages._\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that wherever the calcareous strata are\r\nsufficiently hard and compact to support a roof, caves are to be found\r\nin greater or less abundance. Those of Devonshire occur in the Devonian\r\nlimestone; those of Somerset, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire,\r\nand Northumberland, as well as of Belgium and Westphalia, in that\r\nof the carboniferous age. In France also, those of Maine and Anjou,\r\nand most of those of the Pyrenees and in the department of Aude, are\r\nhollowed in carboniferous limestone, as well as the greater part of\r\nthose in North America, in Virginia, and Kentucky. The cave of Kirkdale\r\nin Yorkshire, and most of those in Franconia and in Bavaria penetrate\r\nJurassic limestones, which have received the name of Hohlenkalkstein\r\nfrom the abundance of caverns which they contain. They are developed on\r\na large scale in the Swiss and French Jura, and in some cases afford\r\npassage to powerful streams, and in others are more or less filled\r\nwith ice, thus constituting the singular “glacières” that have been so\r\nably explored by the Rev. G. F. Browne.[22]\r\n\r\nThe compact Neocomian and Cretaceous limestones contain most of the\r\ncaverns of Périgord, Quercy, and Angoumois, and some of those in\r\nProvence and Languedoc, those of Northern Italy, Sicily, Greece,\r\nDalmatia, Carniola, and Turkey in Europe, of Asia Minor and Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary limestones, writes M. Desnoyers,[23] offer sometimes, but\r\nvery rarely, caves that have become celebrated for the bones which\r\nthey contain, such as those of Lunel-Viel, near Montpelier, those of\r\nPondres and Souvignargues, near Sommières (Gard), and of Saint Macaire\r\n(Gironde). The same may also be said of the calcaire grossier of the\r\nbasin of Paris.\r\n\r\nCertain rocks composed of gypsum also contain caverns of the same sort\r\nas those in the limestones. In Thuringia, for example, near Eisleben,\r\nthey occur in the saliferous and gypseous strata of the zechstein,\r\nand are connected with large gulfs and cirques on the surface, which\r\nare sometimes filled with water. In the neighbourhood of Paris, and\r\nespecially at Montmorency, they contain numerous bones of the extinct\r\nmammalia. M. Desnoyers points out their identity, in all essentials,\r\nwith those in calcareous strata, and infers that they have been\r\nproduced in the same way. Some of them may have been formed by the\r\nremoval of the salt, which is very frequently interbedded with the\r\ngypsum, by the passage of water. In Cheshire the pumping of the brine\r\nfrom the saliferous and gypseous strata produces subterranean hollows,\r\nwhich sometimes fall in and eventually cause depressions on the\r\nsurface, such as those which are now destroying the town of Northwich,\r\nand causing the neighbouring tidal estuary to extend over what was\r\nformerly meadow land. This explanation, however, will not apply to\r\nthose in the neighbourhood of Paris, because there is no trace of their\r\never having contained salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Relation of Caves to Pot-holes, “Cirques,” and Ravines._\r\n\r\nThe caverns hollowed in calcareous rocks present features by which they\r\nare distinguished from any others. They open, for the most part, on the\r\nabrupt sides of valleys and ravines at various levels, being arranged\r\nround the main axis of erosion just as branches are arranged round\r\nthe trunk of a tree--as, for example, in Cheddar Pass. The transition\r\nin some cases from the valley to the ravine, and from the ravine to\r\nthe cave, is so gradual, that it is impossible to deny that all three\r\nare due to the same cause. The caves themselves ramify in the same\r\nirregular fashion as the valleys, and are to be viewed merely as the\r\ncapillaries in the general valley system, through which the rainfall\r\npasses to join the main channels. Very frequently, however, the\r\ndrainage has found an outlet at a lower level, and its ancient passage\r\nis left dry; but in all cases unmistakeable proof of the erosive action\r\nof water is to be seen in the sand, gravel, and clay which compose the\r\nfloor, as well as in the worn surfaces of the sides and the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn all districts in which caves occur are funnel-shaped cavities of\r\nvarious sizes, known as “pot-holes” or “swallow-holes” in Britain, as\r\n“betoires,” “chaldrons du diable,” “marmites de géants,” in France,\r\nand as “kata-vothra” in Greece, in which the rainfall is collected\r\nbefore it finally disappears in the subterranean passages. They are to\r\nbe seen in all stages; sometimes being mere shallow funnels, that only\r\ncontain water after excessive rain, and at others as profound vertical\r\nshafts, into which the water is continually falling, as in Helln Pot,\r\nin Yorkshire. The cirques, also, described by M. Desnoyers, belong to\r\nthe same class of cavities, although all those which are mentioned by\r\nthe Rev. T. G. Bonney,[24] at the head of valleys, and in some cases\r\nhollowed in shale and igneous rocks, are most probably to be referred\r\nto the vertical, chisel-like action of streams flowing under physical\r\nconditions, that resemble those under which the cañons of the Colorado,\r\nor of the Zambesi, are being excavated, and in which frost, ice, and\r\nsnow have played a very subordinate part.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation between pot-holes, caves, ravines, and valleys\r\nwill be discussed in the rest of this chapter, and illustrated by\r\nEnglish examples; and then we shall proceed to show that the chemical\r\naction of the carbonic acid in the rain-water, and the mechanical\r\nfriction of the sand and gravel, set in motion by the water, by which\r\nProfessor Phillips explains the origin of caves, will equally explain\r\nthe pot-holes and ravines by which they are invariably accompanied.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Water-Cave of Wookey Hole, near Wells, Somerset._\r\n\r\nCaves may be divided into two classes: those which are now mere\r\npassages for water, in which the history of their formation may be\r\nstudied, and those which are dry, and capable of affording shelter\r\nto man and the lower animals. Among the water-caves, that of Wookey\r\nHole[25] is to be noticed first, since its very name implies that it\r\nwas known to the Celtic inhabitants of the south of England, and since\r\nit was among the first, if not the first, of those examined with any\r\ncare in this country, Mr. John Beaumont[26] having brought it before\r\nthe notice of the Royal Society in the year 1680.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Wookey Hole nestles in a valley, through which flows the\r\nriver Axe, and the valley passes insensibly, at its upper end, into a\r\nravine, which is closed abruptly by a wall of rock (Fig. 1), about two\r\nhundred feet high, covered with long streamers and festoons of ivy, and\r\naffording scanty hold, on its ledges and in its fissures, to ferns,\r\nbrambles, and ash saplings. At its base the river Axe issues, in full\r\ncurrent, out of the cave, the lower entrance of which it completely\r\nblocks up, since the water has been kept back by a weir, for the use\r\nof a paper-mill a little distance away. A narrow path through the\r\nwood, on the north side of the ravine, leads to the only entrance\r\nnow open.[27] Thence a narrow passage leads downward into the rock,\r\nuntil, suddenly, you find yourself in a large chamber, at the water\r\nlevel. Then you pass over a ridge, covered with a delicate fretwork\r\nof dripstone, with each tiny hollow full of water, and ornamented\r\nwith brilliant lime crystals. One shapeless mass of dripstone is\r\nknown in local tradition as the Witch of Wookey, turned into stone by\r\nthe prayers of a Glastonbury monk. Beyond this the chamber expands\r\nconsiderably, being some seventy or eighty feet high, and adorned with\r\nbeautiful stalactites, far out of the reach of visitors. The water,\r\nwhich bars further entrance, forms a deep pool, which Mr. James Parker\r\nmanaged to cross on a raft (see Appendix I.) into another chamber,\r\nwhich was apparently easy of access before the construction of the\r\nweir. It was in this further chamber that Dr. Buckland found human\r\nremains and pottery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram of Wookey Hole Cave and Ravine.]\r\n\r\nThe cave has been proved to extend as far as the village of Priddy,\r\nabout two miles off, on the Mendip hills, by the fact observed by Mr.\r\nBeaumont, that the water used in washing the lead ore at that spot, in\r\nhis time, found its way into the river Axe, and poisoned cattle in\r\nthe valley of Wookey. And this observation has been verified during\r\nthe last few years by throwing in colour and chopped straw. The stream\r\nat Priddy sinks into a swallow-hole (Fig. 1), and has its subterranean\r\ncourse determined by the southerly dip of the rock, by which the\r\njoints running north and south afford a more free passage to the water\r\nthan those running east and west. The cave is merely a subterranean\r\nextension of the ravine in the same line, as far as the swallow-hole,\r\nand all three have been hollowed, as we shall see presently, by the\r\naction of the stream and of carbonic acid in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Goatchurch Cave._\r\n\r\nThe largest cavern in the Mendip hills is that locally known as the\r\nGoatchurch, which opens on the eastern side of the lower of the two\r\nravines that branch from the magnificent defile of Burrington Combe,\r\nabout two miles from the village of Wrington, at the height of about\r\n120 feet from the bottom of the ravine. After creeping along a narrow,\r\nmuddy passage, with a steep descent to the west, at an angle of about\r\n30°, you suddenly pass into a stalactitic chamber of considerable\r\nheight and size. From it two small vertical shafts lead into the\r\nlower set of chambers and passages; the first being blocked up, and\r\nthe second being close to a large barrel-shaped stalagmite, to which\r\nMr. Ayshford Sanford, Mr. James Parker, and myself fastened our ropes\r\nwhen we explored the cave in 1864. The latter affords access into a\r\npassage, beautifully arched, and passing horizontally east and west,\r\nand just large enough to admit a man walking upright. At the further\r\nend numerous open fissures, caused by the erosion of the joints in the\r\nlimestone, cross it at right angles, and pass into several ill-defined\r\nchambers, partially stalactitic, but for the most part filled with\r\nloose, bare, cubical masses of limestone. Two of the transverse\r\nfissures lead into a large chamber, at a lower level. At its lower end,\r\non crawling along a narrow passage, we came into a second chamber,\r\nalso of considerable height and depth, at the bottom of which the\r\nnoise of flowing water can be heard through two vertical holes, just\r\nlarge enough to admit of access. On sliding down one of these we found\r\nourselves in a third chamber, which was traversed by a subterranean\r\nstream, doubtless in part the same which disappears in the ravine, at a\r\npoint eighty feet above by aneroid measurement. The temperature of the\r\nwater, as compared with that of the stream outside (49° : 59°), renders\r\nit very probable that, between the point of disappearance in the ravine\r\nand reappearance in the cave, it is joined by a stream of considerable\r\nsubterranean length, since the water could not have lost ten degrees\r\nin the short interval which it had to traverse, were it supplied only\r\nfrom the stream in the ravine. From the point of its disappearance in\r\nthe cave, the water passes downwards to join the main current flowing\r\nunderneath Burrington Combe, that gushes forth in great volume at\r\nRickford. The lowest portion of the cave was eighteen or twenty feet\r\nbelow the stream, and 220 feet below the entrance of the cavern.\r\n\r\nOn examining the floors of the chambers and passages, we discovered\r\nthat they were composed of the same kind of sediment as that which is\r\nnow being deposited by the water in Wookey Hole, and there could be\r\nno doubt but that they had been originally traversed by water. For\r\nthis to have taken place it is necessary to suppose that, while the\r\nGoatchurch was a water cave, the ravine on which it opens was not\r\ndeeper than the entrance--in other words, that in the interval between\r\nthe formation and excavation of the chambers and passages, to the\r\npresent time, the ravine has been excavated in the limestone to a depth\r\nof a hundred and twenty feet, and the water which originally passed\r\nthrough the entrance has found its way, by a new series of passages, to\r\nthe point where it appears at the bottom of the cave.\r\n\r\nWe obtained evidence that the horizontal passage, immediately below the\r\nfirst vertical descent, had been inhabited at a very remote period. At\r\nthe spot where Mr. Beard, of Banwell, obtained a fine tusk of mammoth,\r\nwe found a molar of bear, and a fragment of flint, which were imbedded\r\nin red earth, and were underneath a crust of stalagmite of about two\r\ninches in thickness. It would follow from this, that the date of the\r\nformation of this part of the cave was before the time when the traces\r\nof elephants, bears, and of man were introduced.\r\n\r\nThe cave is the resort of numerous badgers. On hiding ourselves in\r\none of the transverse fissures, and throwing our light across the\r\nhorizontal passage, these animals ran to and fro across the lighted\r\nfield with extraordinary swiftness, and had it not been for the white\r\nstreaks on the sides of their heads, which flashed back the light, they\r\nwould not have been observed. Though they are rarely caught, they must\r\nbe abundant in the district.\r\n\r\nLike all the other large caverns in the district, it has its legends.\r\nThe dwellers in the neighbourhood, who have never cared to explore its\r\nrecesses, relate that a certain dog put in here found its way out,\r\nafter many days, at Wookey Hole, having lost all its hair in scrambling\r\nthrough the narrow passages. At Cheddar the same legend is appropriated\r\nto the Cheddar cave. At Wookey the dog is said to have travelled back\r\nto Cheddar. Some eighteen years ago, while exploring the limestone\r\ncaves at Llanamynech, on the English border of Montgomeryshire, I\r\nmet with a similar story. A man playing the bagpipes is said to have\r\nentered one of the caves, well provisioned with Welsh mutton, and after\r\nhe had been in for some time his bagpipes were heard two miles from the\r\nentrance, underneath the small town of Llanamynech. He never returned\r\nto tell his tale. The few bones found in the cave are supposed to be\r\nthose which he had picked on the way. This is doubtless another form of\r\nthe story of the dog; both owe their origin to the vague impression,\r\nwhich most people have, of the great extent of caverns, and both\r\nversions are equally current in France and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Water-caves of Derbyshire._\r\n\r\nThe celebrated cavern of the Peak, at Castleton in Derbyshire, presents\r\nthe same essential character as that of Wookey Hole. It runs into the\r\nhill-side at the end of the ravine, and is traversed by a powerful\r\nstream of water, which has been met with in driving an horizontal\r\nadit in lead-mining at a considerable distance from the entrance, and\r\nfinally traced to a distant swallow-hole. At a little distance from\r\nBuxton a smaller cave, known as Poole’s Cavern, is in part traversed\r\nby water, which has found an outlet at a lower level, and allowed of\r\nthe present entrance being used by the Brit-Welsh (Romano-Celtic)\r\ninhabitants of the district as a habitation in the fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies.[28] There are, besides these, very many others, some known,\r\nothers unknown, that debouch on the sides of the dales in Derbyshire\r\nand Staffordshire, and are all well worthy of examination, since they\r\nillustrate not merely the history of the formation of caves, but also\r\nhave been proved to contain works of art, pottery and flint implements,\r\nand the remains of animals, such as the mammoth and rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Water-caves of Yorkshire._\r\n\r\nThe caves in the mountain limestone of Yorkshire rival in size those\r\nof Carniola, or those of Greece, and they are to be seen in all stages\r\nof formation. In their gloomy recesses all the higher qualities of a\r\nmountaineer may be exercised, and there is sufficient danger to give a\r\nkeen zest to their exploration. The mountain streams sometimes plunge\r\ninto a yawning chasm, locally known as a pot, and at others emerge from\r\nthe dark portals of a cave in full current. There is, perhaps, no place\r\nin the world where the subterranean circulation of water may be studied\r\nwith better advantage.\r\n\r\nIngleborough forms a centre from which the rainfall on every side\r\nfinds its way into the dales, through a system of caves more or less\r\ncomplicated, which during the last forty years have been thoroughly\r\nexplored by Mr. Farrer, Mr. Birkbeck, and Mr. Metcalfe. On the south\r\nit collects in a ravine, and then leaps into a deep bottle-shaped hole\r\ncalled “Gaping Gill,” into which Mr. Birkbeck unsuccessfully attempted\r\nto descend, the sharp edges of the rock cutting the rope, and very\r\nnearly causing a serious accident. In depth it is about three hundred\r\nfeet. The stream thence finds its way through a series of chambers and\r\npassages until it reappears in the famous Ingleborough cave, that was\r\nexplored by Mr. Farrer in the year 1837, and proved to pass into the\r\nrock between seven and eight hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe present entrance of the Ingleborough cave[29] is dry, except after\r\nheavy rains, when the current reverts to its old passage. The following\r\nadmirable account of the interior is given by Professor Phillips:--[30]\r\n\r\n“From Mr. Farrer’s plan and description, as given in the ‘Proceedings\r\nof the Geological Society,’ June 14, 1848, and from information\r\nobligingly communicated to me, a clear notion of the history of this\r\nmost instructive spar grotto may be formed. For about eighty yards\r\nfrom the entrance the cave has been known immemorially. At this point\r\nJosiah Harrison, a gardener in Mr. Farrer’s service, broke through a\r\nstalagmitical barrier which the water had formed, and obtained access\r\nto a series of expanded cavities and contracted passages, stretching\r\nfirst to the N., then to the N.W.; afterwards to the N. and N.E., and\r\nfinally to the E., till after two years spent in the interesting toil\r\nof discovery, at a distance of 702 yards from the mouth, the explorers\r\nrested from their labours in a large and lofty irregular grotto, in\r\nwhich they heard the sound of water falling in a still more advanced\r\nsubterranean recess. It has been ascertained, at no inconsiderable\r\npersonal risk, that this water falls into a deep pool or linn at a\r\nlower level, beyond which further progress appears to be impracticable.\r\nIn fact Mr. Farrer explored this dark lake by swimming--a candle in his\r\ncap and a rope round his body.\r\n\r\n“In this long and winding gallery, fashioned by nature in the\r\nmarble heart of the mountain, floor, roof, and sides are everywhere\r\nintersected by fissures which were formed in the consolidation of the\r\nstone. To these fissures and the water which has passed down them, we\r\nowe the formation of the cave and its rich furniture of stalactites.\r\nThe direction of the most marked fissures is almost invariably N.W.\r\nand S.E., and when certain of these (which in my geological work I\r\nhave called master fissures) occur, the roof of the cave is usually\r\nmore elevated, the sides spread out right and left, and often ribs and\r\npendants of brilliant stalactite, placed at regular distances, convert\r\nthe rude fissure into a beautiful aisle of primæval architecture. Below\r\nmost of the smaller fissures hang multitudes of delicate translucent\r\ntubules, each giving passage to drops of water. Splitting the rock\r\nabove, these fissures admit, or formerly admitted, dropping water:\r\ncontinued through the floor, the larger rifts permit, or formerly\r\npermitted, water to enter or flow out of the cave. By this passage of\r\nwater, continued for ages on ages, the original fissure was in the\r\nfirst instance enlarged, through the corrosive action of streams of\r\nacidulated water; by the withdrawal of the streams to other fissures,\r\na different process was called into operation. The fissure was bathed\r\nby drops instead of streams of water, and these drops, exposed to air\r\ncurrents and evaporation, yielded up the free carbonic acid to the\r\nair and the salt of lime to the rock. Every line of drip became the\r\naxis of a stalactitical pipe from the roof; every surface bathed by\r\nthin films of liquid became a sheet of sparry deposit. The floor grew\r\nup under the droppings into fantastic heaps of stalagmite, which,\r\nsometimes reaching the pipes, united roof and floor by pillars of\r\nexquisite beauty.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of its exploration, the water stood at a considerably\r\nhigher level inside than at the present time, and formed deep pools.\r\nThe barrier of dripstone has been cut through, and the water level\r\nlowered, and a passage made for a considerable distance. Inside, the\r\nold water line, which separated the subaërial from the subaqueous\r\ndripstone, is very distinct, the former being deposited in thick\r\nbosses, crumpled curtains, drops, straws, pyramids, and other fantastic\r\ndrip-structures, while the latter is honeycombed, and composed of\r\nrounded, grape-like masses. Between them an ice-like coating of\r\nstalagmite forms a dividing line, now supported in mid air, but that\r\nformerly shot across the surface of the pools that have been drained,\r\nor rested on the mud and stones which had been brought down by the\r\nstream in ancient times. In some places it still rests on the surface\r\nof the pools.\r\n\r\nA stalactitic curtain on the right-hand side presents a very singular\r\nappearance, its surface being covered with an abundant crop of tiny\r\nclub-like bodies about one-tenth of an inch in length, and consisting\r\neach of a shining drop of water, enclosing a minute fungus. These may\r\npossibly explain in some degree the peculiar fungoid-appearance of\r\ncertain small bosses of dripstone which I have met with in the caves\r\nof Pembrokeshire: for an accumulation of carbonate of lime on such a\r\nnucleus would produce the forms which they assume (see Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nThere are also magnificent groups of dripstone, and each joint in the\r\nrock is adorned with lines, and pipes, and fringes of calc spar, or\r\nwidened out into roof-shaped hollows, and traversed by deep, vertical\r\ngrooves, caused by the passage of water laden with carbonic acid.\r\nThe general surface of the roof, where the rock is bare, has had its\r\nfossils etched out by the acidulated water. In one place you may stand\r\nunder a branching coral, with its sides and base distinctly marked, and\r\nin another fossil shells stand out almost in their original beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rate of the Accumulation of Stalagmite._\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the calcareous matter is being deposited at the\r\npresent time is very easy to be estimated, for that accumulated since\r\nthe passage was cleared out is white, and contrasts with the dirty,\r\ngrey-red colour of the older kind. In one case a thickness of 0·24\r\nhad been formed in thirty-five years, by the water flowing down the\r\nside of the passage excavated by Mr. Farrer, while in another, in\r\nabout the same time, 0·05 inch had been formed. This would give an\r\nannual accumulation of 0·0068 in the one case, and in the other about\r\none-fifth of that amount. This rate does not agree with the rate of\r\nincrease noted by Mr. Farrer and Professor Phillips in the case of a\r\nlarge stalagmite called the Jockey Cap, on which a line of drops is\r\ncontinually falling from one point in the roof. Its circumference in\r\n1839 measured 118 inches, in 1845, 120 inches, and in 1873, I found\r\nit to be 128 inches. The annual rate of increase from 1845 to 1873 is\r\n·2941 inch, and that from 1839 to 1845 is ·2857. I found, however,\r\nthat the most remarkable increase was that in height. In 1845 its\r\napex was 95·25 inches from the roof, in 1873, 87 inches, which would\r\nimply an annual deposit of not less than ·2946. (See Appendix II.)\r\nAt this rate it will arrive at the roof in about 295 years. But even\r\nthis comparatively short lapse of time will probably be diminished by\r\nthe growth of a pendant stalactite above, that is now being formed in\r\nplace of that which measured 10 inches in 1845, and has since been\r\naccidentally destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that the Jockey Cap may be the result, not of the\r\ncontinuous, but of the intermittent drip of water containing carbonate\r\nof lime, and that therefore the present rate of growth is not a measure\r\nof its past or future condition. Its age in 1845 was estimated by\r\nProfessor Phillips at 259 years, on the supposition that all or nearly\r\nall of the carbonate of lime in each pint was deposited. If, however,\r\nit grew at its present rate, it may be not more than 100 years old; and\r\nif it be taken as a measure of the rate generally, all the stalagmites\r\nand stalactites in the cave may not date further back than the time of\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from this instance of rapid accumulation, that the value\r\nof a layer of stalagmite in measuring the antiquity of deposits below\r\nit, is comparatively little. The layers, for instance, in Kent’s Hole,\r\nwhich are generally believed to have demanded a considerable lapse of\r\ntime, may possibly have been formed at the rate of a quarter of an inch\r\nper annum, and the human bones which lie buried under the stalagmite\r\nin the cave of Bruniquel, are not for that reason to be taken to be\r\nof vast antiquity. It may be fairly concluded, that the thickness of\r\nlayers of stalagmite cannot be used as an argument in support of the\r\nremote age of the strata below. At the rate of a quarter of an inch\r\nper annum, twenty feet of stalagmite might be formed in 1,000 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Descent into Helln Pot._\r\n\r\nThe subterranean passages grouped round Helln Pot, a tremendous chasm\r\nnear Selside, on the east of Simon’s Fell in Ribblesdale, illustrate\r\nin a remarkable degree the mode in which the water is at present\r\nwearing away the rock. Those which have been explored constitute the\r\nLong Churn Cavern, which is comparatively easy of access through a\r\nhole known as Diccan Pot (Fig. 2, _a_). On descending into it, the\r\nvisitor finds himself in the bed of a stream that now roars in a\r\nwaterfall, now gurgles over the large fallen blocks from the roof, and\r\nthat here and there has worn for itself deep pools by the mechanical\r\nfriction of the sand and pebbles brought down by the current. If it be\r\nfollowed down after passing over a waterfall, the light of day is seen\r\nstreaming upwards beneath the feet from the point where the water leaps\r\ninto the great chasm of Helln Pot (Figs. 2, _b_. 3, _a_). Above the\r\nentrance there is a complicated network of passages, some dry, and some\r\ncontaining streams which have not yet been fully explored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Diagram of Helln Pot and the Long Churn\r\nCavern.]\r\n\r\nThe two actions by which caves are hewn out of the calcareous rock are\r\nseen here in operation side by side. Below the level of the stream\r\nthe rock is seen to be smoothed and polished by the mechanical action\r\nof the materials swept down by the current. Above the water-level the\r\nsides of the cave are honeycombed and eaten into the most fantastic and\r\ncomplex shapes, the resultant surface (see Fig. 7) bearing small points\r\nand keen knife-edges of stone, that stand out in relief and mark the\r\nless soluble portions of the rock. This is due to the chemical effect\r\nof the carbonic acid in the water percolating through the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of Helln Pot.]\r\n\r\nThe Helln Pot, into which the stream flowing through the Long Churn\r\nCave falls, is a fissure (Figs. 2, 3, 4) a hundred feet long by thirty\r\nfeet wide, that engulfs the waters of a little stream on the surface,\r\nwhich are dissipated in spray long before they reach the bottom.\r\nFrom the top you look down on a series of ledges, green with ferns\r\nand mosses, and, about a hundred feet from the surface, an enormous\r\nfragment of rock forms a natural bridge across the chasm from one ledge\r\nto another. A little above this is the debouchement of the stream\r\nflowing through the Long Churn Cave (Fig. 3, _a_), through which Mr.\r\nBirkbeck and Mr. Metcalfe made the first perilous descent in 1847. The\r\nparty, consisting of ten persons, ventured into this awful chasm with\r\nno other apparatus than ropes, planks, a turn-tree, and a fire-escape\r\nbelt. On emerging from the Long Churn Cave they stood on a ledge of\r\nrock about twelve feet wide, and which gave them free access to the\r\n“bridge” (Fig. 2, _b_). This was a rock ten feet long, which rested\r\nobliquely on the ledges. Having crossed over this, they crept behind\r\nthe waterfall which descended from the top, and fixed their pulley,\r\nfive being let down while the rest of the party remained behind to\r\nhoist them up again. In this way they reached the bottom of the pot,\r\nwhich before had never been trod by the foot of man. Thence they\r\nfollowed the stream downwards as far as the first great waterfall, down\r\nwhich Mr. Metcalfe was venturesome enough to let himself with a rope,\r\nand to push onwards until daylight failed. He was within a very little\r\nof arriving at the end of the cave into which the stream flows, but\r\nwas obliged to turn back to the daylight without having accomplished\r\nhis purpose. The whole party eventually, after considerable danger and\r\ntrouble, returned safely from this most bold adventure.\r\n\r\nA second descent was made in 1848 from the surface, and a third in\r\nthe spring of 1870, in both of which Mr. Birkbeck took the lead. The\r\napparatus employed consisted of a windlass (Fig. 3), supported on two\r\nbaulks of timber, and a bucket, covered with a shield, sufficiently\r\nlarge to hold two people, and two guiding ropes to prevent the\r\nrevolution of the bucket in mid air. There was also a party of navvies\r\nto look after the mechanical contrivances, and two ladders about eight\r\nfeet long to provide for contingencies at the bottom. Thirteen of\r\nus went down, including three ladies. As we descended, the fissure\r\ngradually narrowed, until at the bottom it was not more than ten feet\r\nwide. The actual vertical descent was a hundred and ninety-eight feet.\r\nAfter running the gauntlet of the waterfall we landed in the bed of\r\nthe stream, which hurried downwards over large boulders of limestone\r\nand lost itself in the darkness of a large cave, about seventy feet\r\nhigh. We traced it downwards, through pools and rapids to the first\r\nwaterfall, of about twenty feet. This obstacle prevented most of the\r\nparty going further, for the ladders were too short to reach to the\r\nbottom. By lashing them together, however, and letting them down, we\r\nwere able to reach the first round with the aid of a rope, and to\r\ncross over the deep pool at the bottom. Thence we went on downwards\r\nthrough smaller waterfalls and rapids, until we arrived at a descent\r\ninto a chamber, where the roar of water was deafening. Down to this\r\npoint the daylight glimmered feebly, but here our torches made but\r\nlittle impression on the darkness. One of the party volunteered to go\r\ndown with a rope, and was suddenly immersed in a deep pool; the rest,\r\nprofiting by his misadventure, managed to cling on to small points of\r\nrock, and eventually to reach the floor of the chamber. We stood at\r\nlast on the lowest accessible point of the cave, about 300 feet from\r\nthe surface. It was indeed one of the most remarkable sights that\r\ncould possibly be imagined. Besides the waterfall down which we came,\r\na powerful stream poured out of a cave too high up for the torches to\r\npenetrate the darkness, and fell into a deep pool in the middle of the\r\nfloor, causing such a powerful current of air that all our torches were\r\nblown out except one. The two streams eventually united and disappeared\r\nin a small black circling pool, which completely barred further ingress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagram of Helln Pot, showing Waterfall at the\r\nBottom.]\r\n\r\nThe floor of the pot and the cave was strewn with masses of limestone\r\nrounded by the action of the streams; and the water-channels were\r\nsmoothed and grooved and polished, in a most extraordinary way, by the\r\nsilt and stones carried along by the current. Some of the layers of\r\nlimestone were jet black, and others were of a light fawn-colour, and\r\nas the strata were nearly horizontal, the alternation of colours gave\r\na peculiarly striking effect to the walls. Beneath each waterfall was\r\na pool more or less deep, and here and there in the bed of the stream\r\nwere holes, drilled in the rock by stones whirled round by the force\r\nof the water. High up, out of the present reach of the water, were old\r\nchannels, which had evidently been watercourses before the pot and\r\ncave had been cut down to their present level. In the sides of the pot\r\nthere are two vertical grooves reaching very nearly from the top to the\r\nbottom, which are unmistakeably the work of ancient waterfalls. There\r\nwas no stalactite, but everywhere the water was wearing away the rock\r\nand enlarging the cave. We found our way back without any difficulty,\r\na small passage on the right-hand side enabling us to avoid the very\r\nunpleasant task of scrambling up two of the waterfalls. We arrived\r\nfinally at the top, after about five hours’ work in the cave, wet to\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nWe had very little trouble in making this descent, because of the\r\ncompleteness of Mr. Birkbeck’s preparations; but we could fully realize\r\nwhat a dangerous feat the first explorers performed when they ventured\r\ninto an unknown chasm, comparatively unprepared. The very name “Helln\r\nPot,” = Ællan Pot, or Mouth of Hell, testifies to the awe with which\r\nthe Angles looked down into its recesses.[31]\r\n\r\nSuch is the interior of one of those great natural laboratories in\r\nwhich water is wearing away the solid rock, either hollowing it into\r\ncaves or cutting it into ravines. At the bottom of Helln Pot it was\r\nimpossible not to realize, that the enormous chasm had been formed by\r\nthe same action as that by which it was being deepened before our eyes.\r\nIt was merely a portion of the vast cave into which it led, which had\r\nbeen deprived of its roof, and opened out to the light of heaven. The\r\nbridge was but a fragment of the roof which happened to fall upon the\r\ntwo ledges. The rounded masses of rock at the bottom are fragments that\r\nhave fallen probably within comparatively modern times. The absence of\r\nstalactites and of stalagmites proves that the destructive action is\r\nrapidly going on.\r\n\r\nThe water-course at the bottom contained pebbles and boulders of\r\nlimestone, and gritstone rounded by friction against one another and\r\nthe rocky floor. The gritstone has probably been derived from the wreck\r\nof the boulder clay on the surface above the Helln Pot, and ultimately\r\ntorn from the millstone grit of the higher hills in the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves and Pots at Weathercote._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Waterfall in Pot-hole at Weathercote.]\r\n\r\nOn the north side of Ingleborough the series of caves and pots round\r\nthe little Church of Chapel-en-le-Dale are especially worthy of\r\nattention. The chasm at Weathercote opens suddenly in the hill-side,\r\nand is perfectly accessible to visitors. You come suddenly upon a cleft\r\na hundred feet deep, with its ledges covered with mosses, ferns, and\r\nbrambles; at one end a body of water rushes from a cave, and under a\r\ngreat bridge of rock, and falls seventy-five feet, a mass of snow-white\r\nfoam filling the bottom with spray (Fig. 5). The large masses of\r\nrock piled in wild confusion at the bottom, the dark shadows of the\r\noverhanging ledges, and the thick covering of green moss, to which the\r\nspray clings in tiny glittering drops, form a picture which cannot\r\neasily be forgotten. In the sunshine an almost circular rainbow is\r\nto be seen from the bottom. The stream passes from the bottom into\r\na cave, and thence downwards to two large pots (Fig. 6), about two\r\nhundred yards away. In flood-time the channel has been known to become\r\nblocked up, and Weathercote has been filled to the brim. Usually after\r\nheavy rains the current is said to flow so violently into the first of\r\nthe pot-holes, that it throws up stones at least thirty or forty feet\r\nfrom the bottom, with a peculiar rattling noise. From this strange\r\nphenomenon it is known as Jingle Pot, while the lower of the two is\r\ntermed Hurtle Pot, because in flood-time the water whirls so fast\r\nround, that it is “hurtled” out at the top. The water flowing through\r\nWeathercote is derived from the little stream of Ellerbeck, which\r\ndisappears in the limestone hills about a mile to the north, and runs\r\nat right angles to Dalebeck, or the stream flowing down to Ingleton,\r\nwhich it has been proved to join at a spot below Jingle Pot, by Mr.\r\nMetcalfe, who made his way down into it from the chasm of Weathercote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Diagram of Subterranean Course of Dalebeck.]\r\n\r\nThe course of Dalebeck, as you pass up the valley of Chapel-en-le-Dale,\r\naffords a striking instance of the dependence of scenery upon the\r\nnature of the rock. In its lower portion it has cut out for itself\r\na deep ravine in the hard Silurian strata, in which you come upon\r\nthe waterfalls, deep pools, and trees, that look as if they had been\r\ntransported bodily from the district of Cader Idris, and inserted into\r\nthe limestone scenery of the dales. The Silurian rocks are very much\r\ncontorted, and on their waterworn edges lie the nearly horizontal\r\nlimestone strata, in which the upper part of the valley has been\r\nscooped. As we rise the ravine opens into a valley (Fig. 6), along\r\nwhich the beck flows, until suddenly it is lost in a fissure, at a\r\nplace called Godsbridge. Its subterranean course is marked, first of\r\nall, by a small depression known as Sandpot, and still higher by Hurtle\r\nPot. It ultimately reappears at the surface, above Weathercote, and\r\nafter passing through a picturesque cavern, known as the Gatekirk, its\r\nfountainhead is reached. The subterranean portions of its course are\r\nin the same right line as the open valley, and the pot-holes have been\r\nformed in the same manner as Helln Pot, by the passage of water at a\r\ntime when the drainage found its way down the valley at a higher level\r\nthan at present, very much as it does now in times of extraordinary\r\nfloods.\r\n\r\nWater-caves such as these are by no means uncommon in Yorkshire. In the\r\ndales there is scarcely a mass of limestone without its subterranean\r\nwater system, as well as channels deserted by water, which are now\r\ndry caves situated at higher levels. These are always arranged on the\r\nline of the natural drainage, and generally open on the sides of the\r\nvalleys and precipices. If you look northward from the flat crown of\r\nIngleborough, you can see the ravines which radiate from it on the\r\nsurface of the shale below, abruptly ending in pot-holes when they\r\nreach the limestone. In each case the streams reappear, issuing out of\r\nthe caves at the points in Chapel-en-le-Dale, where the horizontal beds\r\nof limestone rest on the upturned edges of the impermeable Silurian\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Formation of Caves and their Relation to Pot-holes and Ravines._\r\n\r\nThe general conditions under which caves occur in limestone rocks,\r\nand the phenomena which they present, may be gathered from the above\r\nexamples. Universally the pot-holes, ravines, and caverns are so\r\nassociated together, that there can be but little doubt that they are\r\ndue to the operation of the same causes.\r\n\r\nIt requires but a cursory glance to see at once that running water\r\nwas the main agent. The limestone is so traversed by joints and lines\r\nof shrinkage, that the water rapidly sinks down into its mass, and\r\ncollects in small streams, which owe their direction to the dip of\r\nthe strata and the position of the fissures. These channels are being\r\ncontinually deepened and widened by the mere mechanical action of the\r\npassage of stones and silt. But this is not the only way in which the\r\nrock is gradually eroded. The limestone is composed in great part of\r\npure carbonate of lime, which is insoluble in water. It is, however,\r\nreadily dissolved in any liquid containing carbonic acid, which is\r\nan essential part of our atmosphere, is invariably present in the\r\nrain-water, and is given off by all organic bodies. By this invisible\r\nagent the hard crystalline rock is always being attacked in some form\r\nor another. The very snails that take refuge in its crannies leave an\r\nenduring mark of their presence in a surface fretted with their acid\r\nexhalations, which sometimes pass current among geologists for the\r\nborings of pholades, and are the innocent cause of much speculation as\r\nto the depression of the mountain-tops beneath the sea in comparatively\r\nmodern times. The carbonic acid taken up by the rain is derived, in the\r\nmain, from the decomposing vegetable matter which generally forms the\r\nsurface soil on the limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Diagram of an acid-worn joint, Doveholes,\r\nDerbyshire.]\r\n\r\nThe view from the ancient camp on the top of Ingleborough offers a\r\nstriking example of the effect of rain-water in eroding the surface of\r\nthe limestone. As you look down over the dark crags of millstone grit,\r\ngreat, grey, pavement-like masses of limestone strike the eye, standing\r\nabove the heather, perfectly bare, and in the distance resembling\r\nclearings, and in rainy weather sheets of snow. On approaching them\r\nthe surface of erosion becomes more and more apparent, and the shapes\r\ndue to the mere accident of varying hardness in the rock, or the\r\nvarying quantity of water passing over it, present a most astonishing\r\nvariety. There are, however, general principles underlying the\r\nconfusion. The lines of joints in the strata being lines of weakness,\r\nsearched out by the acid-laden water, have been widened into chasms,\r\nsometimes of considerable depth; and as they cross at right angles,\r\nthe whole surface is formed of rectangular masses, each insulated\r\nfrom its fellow, and some of them detached from the strata beneath so\r\nas to form rocking-stones. The mode in which the acid has attacked\r\none of these joints in the limestone of Doveholes in Derbyshire is\r\nrepresented in Figure 7, the surface being honeycombed and worn into\r\nsharp points, solely by chemical action. The minute fossil-shells\r\nalso, and fragments of crinoid standing out in bold relief, lead to\r\nthe same conclusion--that the denuding agent is chemical and not\r\nmechanical. Each of the upper surfaces of the blocks is traversed by\r\nsmall depressions, which are valley systems in miniature, in which the\r\ntiny valleys converge into a main trunk leading into the nearest chasm.\r\nThere are also tiny caves and hollows, that are sometimes mistaken for\r\nborings made by pholas. In the chasms the vegetation is most luxuriant,\r\nand the dark green fronds of harts-tongue, the delicate Lady-fern, and\r\nthe graceful _Asplenium nigrum_, grow with a rare luxuriance.\r\n\r\nIn these pavements every feature of limestone scenery is represented on\r\na minute scale. There are the valley systems on the surface, determined\r\nby the direction of the drainage; the long chasms represent the open\r\nvalleys and ravines, and the caves and hollows, for the most part, run\r\nin the line of the joints.\r\n\r\nThe carbonic acid has left precisely the same kind of proof of its work\r\nwithin the caves as we find above-ground; and it would necessarily\r\nfollow, that to it, as well as to the mechanical power of the waters\r\nflowing through them, their formation and enlargement must be due, as\r\nProfessor Phillips has pointed out in his “Rivers, Mountains, and Sea\r\nCoast of Yorkshire,” pp. 30-1.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding pages it will be seen that caves in calcareous\r\nrocks are merely passages hollowed out by water, which has sought out\r\nthe lines of weakness, or the joints formed by the shrinkage of the\r\nstrata during their consolidation. The work of the carbonic acid is\r\nproved, not merely by the acid-worn surfaces of the interior of the\r\ncaves, but also by the large quantity of carbonate of lime which is\r\ncarried away by the water in solution. That, on the other hand, of the\r\nmechanical friction of the stones and sand against the sides and bottom\r\nof the water-courses, is sufficiently demonstrated by their grooved,\r\nscratched, and polished surfaces, and by the sand, silt, and gravel\r\ncarried along by the currents. The generally received hypothesis, that\r\nthey have been the result of a subterranean convulsion, is disproved by\r\nthe floor and roof being formed, in very nearly every case, of solid\r\nrock; for it would be unreasonable to hold that any subterranean force\r\ncould act from below, in such a manner as to hollow out the complicated\r\nand branching passages, at different levels, without affecting the\r\nwhole mass of the rock. Nor is there cause for holding the view put\r\nforth by M. Desnoyers[32] or M. Dupont,[33] that they are the result\r\nof the passage of hydrothermal waters. The causes at present at work,\r\noperating through long periods of time, offer a reasonable explanation\r\nof their existence in every limestone district; and those which are\r\nno longer watercourses can generally be proved to have been formerly\r\ntraversed by running water, by the silt, sand, and rounded pebbles\r\nwhich they contain. In their case, either the drainage of the district\r\nhas been changed by the upheaval or depression of the rock, or the\r\nstreams have searched out for themselves a passage at a lower level.\r\n\r\nBut if caves have been thus excavated, it is obvious that ravines and\r\nvalleys in limestone districts are due to the operation of the same\r\ncauses. If, for instance, we refer to Figures 1 and 6, we shall see\r\nthat the open valley passes insensibly into a ravine, and that into\r\na cave. The ravine is merely a cave which has lost its roof, and the\r\nvalley is merely the result of the weathering of the sides of the\r\nravine. There can be no manner of doubt but that, in both these cases,\r\nthe ravine is gradually encroaching on the cave, and the valley on\r\nthe ravine; and if the strata be exposed to atmospheric agencies long\r\nenough, the valley of the Axe will extend as far as Priddy (Fig. 1),\r\nand that of Dalebeck to the watershed above the Gatekirk cave (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the lofty precipice of Malham Cove, near Settle,\r\nin Yorkshire (Fig. 8), is slowly falling away and uncovering the\r\nsubterranean course of the Aire. Eventually the ravine thus formed will\r\nextend as far as Malham Tarn, and the Aire flow exposed to the light of\r\nday from its source to the sea.[34]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Diagram of Source of the Aire at Malham.]\r\n\r\nThis view is applicable to many if not to all ravines and valleys in\r\ncalcareous rocks, such as the Pass at Cheddar, or the gorge of the Avon\r\nat Clifton, and those of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Wales. And since\r\nthe agents by which the work is done are universal, and calcareous rock\r\nfor the most part of the same chemical composition, the results are the\r\nsame, and the calcareous scenery everywhere of the same type. In the\r\nlapse of past time, so enormous as to be incapable of being grasped by\r\nthe human intellect, these agents are fully capable of producing the\r\ndeepest ravines, the widest valleys, and the largest caves.\r\n\r\nThis view of the relation of caves to ravines was so strongly held by\r\nM. Desnoyers, that he terms the latter “cavernes à ciel ouvert.” I\r\narrived independently at the same conclusion after the study of the\r\nscenery of limestone for many years.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, however, in northern latitudes and in high altitudes,\r\nthe ravine or valley so formed has been subsequently widened and\r\ndeepened by glacial action. That, for instance, of Chapel-en-le-Dale\r\nbears unmistakeable evidence of the former flow of a glacier, in the\r\n_roches moutonnées_ and travelled blocks that it contains. To this is\r\ndue the flowing contour and even slope of its lower portion.\r\n\r\nThe pot-holes and “cirques” in calcareous rocks with no outlet at the\r\nsurface, may also be accounted for by the operation of the same causes\r\nas those which have produced caves. Each represents the weak point\r\ntowards which the rainfall has converged, caused very generally by\r\nthe intersection of the joints. This has gradually been widened out,\r\nbecause the upper portions of the rock would be the first to seize the\r\natoms of carbonic acid, and thus be dissolved more quickly than the\r\nlower portions. Hence the funnel shape which they generally assume, and\r\nwhich can be studied equally in the compact limestone or in the soft\r\nupper chalk. They are to be seen on a small scale also in all limestone\r\n“pavements.” Sometimes, however, the first chance which the upper\r\nportions of the funnels have of being eroded by the acidulated water,\r\nis more than counter-balanced by the increased quantity converging at\r\nthe bottom, and the funnel ends in a vertical shaft. If the area in the\r\nrock thus excavated be sufficiently large to allow of the development\r\nof a current of water, the mechanical action of the fragments swept\r\nalong its course will have an important share in the work, as we have\r\nseen to be the case in Helln Pot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves not generally found in Line of Faults._\r\n\r\nIn some few cases the lines of weakness which have been worn into\r\ncaves, pot-holes, ravines, and valleys, may have been produced, as\r\nM. Desnoyers believes, by subterranean movements of elevation and\r\ndepression; but in all those which I have investigated the faults do\r\nnot determine the direction of the caverns. The mountain limestone\r\nof Castleton, in Derbyshire, offers an example of caves intersecting\r\nfaults without any definite relation being traceable between them. The\r\nramifications of the Peak cavern traverse the Speedwell Mine nearly\r\nat right angles, and the water flowing through it has been traced,\r\nMr. Pennington informs me, to a swallow-hole near Chapel-en-le-Frith,\r\nrunning across two, if not three faults, which are laid down in the\r\ngeological map. As a general rule caverns are as little affected by\r\ndisturbance of the rock as ravines and valleys which have been formed\r\nin the main irrespective of the lines of fault.\r\n\r\nM. Desnoyers points out the close analogy between caverns and mineral\r\nveins, and infers that both are due to the same causes. This,\r\nundoubtedly, exists in that class of veins which are known to miners as\r\n“pipe” and “flat veins;” and there is clear proof, in the majority of\r\ncases, that the cavities in which the minerals occur have been formed\r\nby the action of running water, and have subsequently been more or less\r\nfilled with their mineral contents; and these have been deposited on\r\nthe sides of the cavity by the same “incretionary[35]” action, as that\r\nby which dripstone is now being formed in the present caves from the\r\nsolution of carbonate of lime. Such veins present every conceivable\r\nform of irregularity, and frequently contain silt, sand, and gravel,\r\nwhich have been left behind by their streams, and their history is\r\nidentical with that of the caverns.\r\n\r\nIt is not so, however, with the second class of veins, the “rake,”\r\n“right running,” and “cross courses,” as the miners term them, or\r\nthose which occupy lines of fault. The fissures which contain the ore\r\nare proved very frequently, by their scratched and grooved sides,\r\nand polished surfaces or slicken-sides, to have been the result of\r\nsubterranean movements by which the rock has been broken by mechanical\r\nforce. They have been subsequently modified, in various ways, by the\r\npassage of water, and filled with minerals, in the same manner as\r\nthe preceding class. With this exception they present no analogy to\r\nthe caverns, with which they contrast strongly in their rectilinear\r\ndirection, as well as in their purely mechanical origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The various Ages of Caves._\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that caves were formed in calcareous rocks from\r\nthe time that they were raised to the level of the sea, since they\r\nabound in the Coral Islands. “Caverns,” writes Prof. Dana,[36] “are\r\nstill more remarkable on the Island of Atiu, on which the coral-reef\r\nstands at about the same height above the sea as on Oahu. The Rev.\r\nJohn Williams states--that there are seven or eight of large extent on\r\nthe Island of Tuto; one he entered by a descent of twenty feet, and\r\nwandered a mile in one only of its branches, without finding an end to\r\n‘its interminable windings.’ He says--‘Innumerable openings presented\r\nthemselves on all sides as we passed along, many of which appeared to\r\nbe equal in height, beauty, and extent to the one we were following.\r\nThe roof, a stratum of coral-rock fifteen feet thick, was supported by\r\nmassy and superb stalactitic columns, besides being thickly hung with\r\nstalactites from an inch to many feet in length. Some of these pendants\r\nwere just ready to unite themselves to the floor, or to a stalagmitic\r\ncolumn rising from it. Many chambers were passed through whose\r\nfret-work ceilings and columns of stalactites sparkled brilliantly,\r\namid the darkness, with the reflected light of our torches. The effect\r\nwas produced not so much by single objects, or groups of them, as by\r\nthe amplitude, the depth, and the complications of this subterranean\r\nworld.’”\r\n\r\nCalcareous rocks might, therefore, be expected to contain fissures and\r\ncaves of various ages. In the Mendip Hills they have been proved by\r\nMr. Charles Moore to contain fossils of Rhætic age, the characteristic\r\ndog-fishes, _Acrodus minimus_, and _Hybodus reticulatus_, the elegant\r\nsculptured Ganoid fish, _Gryrolepis tenuistriatus_, and the tiny\r\nmarsupials, Microlestes and its allies. This singular association of\r\nterrestrial with marine creatures is due to the fact, that while that\r\narea was being slowly depressed beneath the Rhætic and Liassic seas,\r\nthe remains were mingled together on the coast-line, and washed into\r\nthe crevices and holes in the rock.\r\n\r\nThe older caves and fissures have very generally been blocked up by\r\naccumulations of calc-spar or other minerals, and they are arranged on\r\na plan altogether independent of the existing systems of drainage.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that no fissures or caves should, with the\r\nabove exception, contain the remains of animals of a date before the\r\nPleistocene age. There can be but little doubt that they were used\r\nas places of shelter in all ages, and they must have entombed the\r\nremains of the animals that fell into them, or were swept into them by\r\nthe streams. Caves there must have been long before, and the Eocene\r\nPalæotheres, and Anoplotheres met their death in the open pit-falls,\r\njust as the sheep and cattle do at the present time. The Hyænodon\r\nof the Meiocene had, probably, the same cave-haunting tastes as his\r\ndescendant, the living Hyæna, and the marsupials of the Mesozoic age\r\nmight be expected to be preserved in caves, like the fossil marsupials\r\nof Australia. The chances of preservation of the remains when once\r\ncemented into a fine breccia, or sealed down with a crystalline\r\ncovering of stalagmite, are very nearly the same as those under\r\nwhich the Pleistocene animals have been handed down to us. The only\r\nreasonable explanation of the non-discovery of such remains seems to\r\nbe, that the ancient suites of caves and fissures containing them,\r\nand for the most part near the then surface of the rock, have been\r\ncompletely swept away by denudation, while the present caverns were\r\neither then not excavated or inaccessible.\r\n\r\nSuch an hypothesis will explain the fact that the no ossiferous caverns\r\nare older than the Pleistocene age, not merely in Europe, but in North\r\nand South America, Australia, and New Zealand. The effect of denudation\r\nin rendering the geological record imperfect, may be gathered from\r\nthe estimate, which Mr. Prestwich has formed, of the amount of rock\r\nremoved from the crests of the Mendips and the Ardennes, which is in\r\nthe one case a thickness “of two miles and more,” and in the other as\r\nmuch as “three or four miles.”[37] Under these conditions we could not\r\nexpect to find a series of bone caves reaching far back into the remote\r\ngeological past, since the caves and their contents would inevitably be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Filling up of Caves._\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the condition under which caves become filled up\r\nwith various deposits. If the velocity of the stream in a water-cave\r\nbe lessened, the silt, sand, or pebbles it was hurrying along will\r\nbe dropped, and may ultimately block up the entire watercourse. In\r\nbringing this to pass, however, the carbonate of lime in the water\r\nplays a most important part. If the excess of carbonic acid by which it\r\nis held in solution be lost by evaporation, it immediately reassumes\r\nits crystalline form, and shoots over the surface of the pool like\r\nplates of ice, or is deposited in loose botryoidal masses at their\r\nsides and on their bottoms; and, since the atmospheric water very\r\ngenerally percolates through the crannies in the rock, the sides and\r\nroof of the channel, above the level of the water, are adorned with\r\na stony drapery of every conceivable shape. The rate at which this\r\naccumulation takes place depends upon the free access of air necessary\r\nfor evaporation, and is therefore variable,--as in the case of the\r\nIngleborough cave. In all the caves which I have examined there is a\r\nfree current of air. If a water-channel becomes blocked up by either\r\nor both these causes, the joints and fissures in the rock offer an\r\noutlet to the drainage, more or less free, at a lower level, as in\r\nthe Ingleborough cave, Poole’s cave, near Buxton, and many others.\r\nSometimes, however, owing to the increased rain-fall, or to the\r\nobstruction of the lower channels, the water re-excavates the old\r\npassages, as we shall see to have been the case with the famous caverns\r\nof Kent’s Hole and Brixham. In the summer of 1872, a sudden rain-fall\r\nnot merely opened out for itself a new passage into a swallow-hole\r\nclose to Gaping Gill, on the flanks of Ingleborough, but forced its way\r\nout through the old entrance of the Ingleborough cave, breaking up the\r\ncalcareous breccia, and removing the large stones in its course. A cave\r\nobviously may become dry, either by the drainage passing along a lower\r\nlevel, or by the elevation of the district by subterranean energy.\r\nAfter it has been forsaken by the stream, the particles brought down by\r\nthe atmospheric water percolating through the joints, tend to fill it\r\nup on the surface, and these may be either of clay, loam, or sand.\r\n\r\nThese actions may be studied in this country in the well-known caves of\r\nIngleborough, Buxton, Cheddar, Wookey Hole, and a great many others in\r\nDerbyshire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, Durham, Cumberland, and Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Caldy._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--A View in the Fairy Chamber, Caldy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Stalagmites in the Fairy Chamber, Caldy.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Fairy Chamber, Caldy.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most beautiful stalactite caverns in this country is that on\r\nthe island of Caldy, immediately opposite to Tenby in Pembrokeshire,\r\ndiscovered some years ago in the limestone cliff, and explored by Mr.\r\nAyshford Sanford and the Rev. H. H. Winwood, in 1866, and subsequently\r\nby the writer in 1871 and 1872. On creeping through a narrow entrance\r\nwith an outlook to the sea on a precipitous side of a quarry, a passage\r\nleads to a chamber of considerable horizontal extent, the bottom being\r\ncovered with silt, on which stand pedestals of dripstone from an inch\r\nto two feet in length, each rising from a thin calcareous crust which\r\ndoes not altogether conceal the silt below. From it a low entrance\r\nleads into a fairy-like chamber, the floor consisting of a rich red,\r\ncrystalline pavement, perfectly horizontal, and studded here and there\r\nwith round bosses (Figs. 9, 10, 11), either red or snow-white. From\r\nthe roof hang stalactites offering the same beautiful contrast of\r\ncolours, forming a delicate canopy of tassels, or passing downwards to\r\nthe floor and constituting slender shafts about three feet long, and\r\nabout the diameter of straws. Each of these is hollow, translucent, and\r\nmore or less traversed by water, and in some places each stood next\r\nits fellow, almost as close as the straws in a cornfield. Sometimes\r\nthe shaft stands on a cone (Fig. 11) of dripstone, more or less raised\r\nabove the floor. Small pools of water occupy hollows in the pavement,\r\neach lined with glittering crystals of calcite (Fig. 12), which are\r\nslowly shooting over the surface, and converting some of the open\r\nhollows into bottle-shaped cavities (Fig. 13). Their sides and bottoms\r\nare covered with a crystalline growth of singular beauty, of which an\r\nidea may be formed by woodcut 14, which represents the edge. Where the\r\ndrip happened to fall into a shallow pool, it gradually built up for\r\nitself a cone, on the lower portion of which the varying water-level\r\nis marked by horizontal rings of crystals (Fig. 15), and the normal\r\nwaterline by the upper horizontal plate. Sometimes these were united\r\nto the roof by a slender straw-shaft. In Figure 11 the original shaft\r\nhas been broken away, and as the direction of the drip has slightly\r\nshifted, a new one gradually descended, until finally it became\r\ncemented to the side of the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Pools in Fairy Chamber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Pool in Fairy Chamber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Edge of Pool in Fairy Chamber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Cone with Straw-column.]\r\n\r\nThe history of these structures is very evident. The straw-like\r\nstalactites were formed by the evaporation of the carbonic acid from\r\nthe surface of each drop of water, as it accumulated in one spot, and\r\nthe consequent deposit of carbonate of lime around its circumference.\r\nIt could not be formed in the centre, because of the continual movement\r\nof the successive drops in falling. By a circumferential growth of\r\nthis kind a small crystal tube, of the diameter of a drop, is slowly\r\ndeveloped, which continues to lengthen until the result is one of the\r\nstraw-columns, with a hole in the centre for the passage of the water,\r\nwhich cannot readily part with its carbonic acid till it arrives at the\r\nend of the tube. Sometimes the hole has been subsequently blocked up\r\nby calc-spar, or the general surface been covered over with successive\r\nlayers, until it becomes a mass of considerable diameter. If the drop\r\nfell into a deep pool, the straw-column was continued down to the\r\nwater-line; if in shallow water, or on the floor, a pedestal was built\r\nup, as is represented in the preceding figures. The crystallization\r\ngoing on in the pools is greater at the surface than below, because\r\nof the greater evaporation, and consequently the stalagmitic film is\r\ngradually extending over it on every side from the edges (Figs. 12, 13).\r\n\r\nAs I broke my way into some of the unexplored recesses, through the\r\nthickly planted straw-shafts, and scene after scene of fairy beauty,\r\nunsullied by man, opened upon my eyes, the ringing of the fragments on\r\nthe crystalline floor that accompanied almost every movement made me\r\nfeel an intruder, and sorry for the destruction.\r\n\r\nIn some places, where the drip was continuous, and the calcareous basin\r\nwhich it had built up for itself shallow, small spherical bodies of\r\ncalcite were so beautifully polished by friction in the agitated water,\r\nthat they deserve the name of cave-pearls from their lustre. In Fig. 16\r\nI have represented a tiny basin with its pearly contents. Where the\r\ndrip had ceased to be continuous each of these formed a nucleus for the\r\ndeposit of calcite crystals, by which they were united to the bottom of\r\nthe basin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Basin containing Cave-pearls.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Fungoid Structures, magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn the principal chamber in the cave, which is very nearly free from\r\ndrip, the upper surfaces of the stones and stalagmites on the floor are\r\ncovered with a peculiar fungoid-like deposit of calcite, consisting\r\nof rounded bosses, attached to the general surface by a pedicle (see\r\nFigs. 17, 18) sometimes not much thicker than a hair. They stood\r\nclose together at various levels, following the inequalities of the\r\nsurface of attachment, and being on an average about 0·2 inch long.\r\nSeveral microscopical sections (Fig. 17) showed that each was formed\r\noriginally on a slight elevation of the general surface, which would\r\ncause a greater evaporation of water than the surrounding portions,\r\nand therefore be covered with a greater deposit of calcite. This\r\nprocess would go on until the height was reached to which the water\r\nslowly passing over the general surface would no longer rise. Hence\r\nthe remarkable uniformity of the height of the bosses. The evaporation\r\nis greater at the point furthest removed from the general surface, and\r\ntherefore the apex is larger than the base (see Fig. 17). In Figure\r\n18 they stand as thickly together as trees in a virgin forest, and\r\nare developed in greatest vigour where the small eminences cause a\r\ngreater evaporation than the small depressions, and are stoutest and\r\nstrongest at the free edges. Some of the pedicles, as in the figure,\r\npresent traces of erosion, the outer layers having been eaten away by\r\nacid-laden water.\r\n\r\nSome of these singular little bosses may have been moulded on minute\r\nfungi, such as those in the cave of Ingleborough, but their presence is\r\nnot revealed by the microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Black-rock Cave, near Tenby._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Fungoid Structure, Black-rock Cave.]\r\n\r\nI met with this remarkable kind of calcareous deposition in a second\r\ncave in the neighbourhood of Tenby. When examining the Black-rock\r\nquarries in 1871, the workmen pointed out a small opening which they\r\nbelieved to be the entrance of a cave, but which was too small for them\r\nto enter. By knocking off, however, a few sharp angles, I got into\r\na small chamber about five feet high, with sides, roof, and bottom\r\ncovered with massive dripstone. A few loose stones rested on the\r\nbottom. The whole surface, even including the stones upon the floor,\r\none of which is figured (Fig. 18), was so completely covered with\r\nthese peculiar fungoid bodies, that it was impossible to move without\r\ndestroying hundreds of them. All were about the same height, 0·2\r\ninches, snow-white, or of a rich reddish brown, and conformed to the\r\nunequal surface on which they stood. It is quite impossible to describe\r\nthe effect of a whole chamber bristling with these peculiar structures.\r\nThe only author by whom they are mentioned, Mr. John Beaumont--who\r\ndescribed the caves of Mendip in 1680, considered them to be veritable\r\nplants of stone.[38] The beautiful forms assumed by the dripstone in\r\nthe caves of Caldy and Black-rock are by no means uncommon, but I have\r\nnever met with them anywhere else in such perfection. They may be\r\nstudied in all stalactitic caverns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Quantity of Carbonate of Lime dissolved by Atmospheric Water._\r\n\r\nA small portion only of the carbonate of lime is deposited as tufa\r\nor dripstone in the neighbourhood of the rock from which it has been\r\nderived, as compared with that carried by the streams into the rivers,\r\nand the rivers into the sea. An idea of this quantity may be formed\r\nfrom the calculation of the solid matter conveyed down by the Thames,\r\ngiven by Mr. Prestwich in his Presidential Address to the Geological\r\nSociety in 1871, p. lxvii.\r\n\r\n“Taking the mean daily discharge of the Thames at Kingston at\r\n1,250,000,000 gallons, and the salts in solution at nineteen grains per\r\ngallon, the mean quantity of dissolved mineral matter there carried\r\ndown by the Thames every twenty-four hours is equal to 3,364,286 lbs.,\r\nor 150 tons, which is equal to 548,230 tons in the year. Of this daily\r\nquantity about two-thirds, or say 1,000 tons, consist of carbonate of\r\nlime and 238 tons of sulphate of lime, while limited proportions of\r\ncarbonate of magnesia, chlorides of sodium and potassium, sulphates of\r\nsoda and potash, silica and traces of iron, alumina, and phosphates,\r\nconstitute the rest. If we refer a small portion of the carbonates and\r\nthe sulphates and chlorides chiefly to the impermeable argillaceous\r\nformations washed by the rain-water, we shall still have at least\r\nten grains per gallon of carbonate of lime, due to the chalk, upper\r\ngreensand, oolitic strata, and marlstone, the superficial area of\r\nwhich, in the Thames basin above Kingston, is estimated by Mr. Harrison\r\nat 2,072 square miles. Therefore the quantity of carbonate of lime\r\ncarried away from this area by the Thames is equal to 797 tons daily,\r\nor 290,905 tons annually, which gives 140 tons removed yearly from\r\neach square mile; or, extending the calculation to a century, we have\r\na total removal of 29,090,500 tons, or of 14,000 tons from each square\r\nmile of surface. Taking a ton of chalk, as a mean, as equal to fifteen\r\ncubic feet, this is equal to the removal of 210,000 cubic feet per\r\ncentury for each square mile, or of 9/100 of an inch from the whole\r\nsurface in the course of a century, so that in the course of 13,200\r\nyears a quantity equal to a thickness of about one foot would be\r\nremoved from our chalk and oolitic districts.”\r\n\r\nThis destructive action, operating through long periods of time,\r\ndestroys not merely the general surface of the limestone, but, where it\r\nis localized by the convergence of water, is capable of excavating the\r\ndeepest gorges and the longest caves. The quantity of material carried\r\naway in solution is a measure of the power of carbonic acid in the\r\ngeneral work of denudation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Circulation of Carbonate of Lime._\r\n\r\nThe circulation of carbonate of lime in nature presents us with a\r\nnever-ending cycle of change. It is conveyed into the sea to be built\r\nup into the tissues of the animal and vegetable inhabitants. It\r\nappears in the gorgeous corallines, nullipores, calcareous sea-weeds,\r\nsea-shells, and in the armour of crustaceans. In the tissues of\r\nthe coral-zoophytes it assumes the form of stony groves, of which\r\neach tree is a colony of animals, and in the wave-defying reef it\r\nreverts to its original state of limestone. Or, again, it is seized\r\nupon by tiny masses of structureless protoplasm, and fashioned into\r\nchambers of endless variety and of infinite beauty, and accumulated\r\nat the bottom of the deeper seas, forming a deposit analogous to our\r\nchalk. In the revolution of ages the bottom of the sea becomes dry\r\nland, the calcareous _débris_ of animal and vegetable life is more\r\nor less compacted together by pressure and by the infiltration of\r\nacid-laden rain-water, and appears as limestone of various hardness and\r\nconstitution. Then the destruction begins again, and caves, pot-holes,\r\nand ravines are again carved out of the solid rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Temperature of Caves._\r\n\r\nThe air in caves is generally of the same temperature as the mean\r\nannual temperature of the district in which they occur, and therefore\r\ncold in summer and warm in winter. This would be a sufficient reason\r\nwhy they should be chosen by uncivilized peoples as habitations.\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable glacières, or caves containing ice instead of\r\nwater, in the Jura, Pyrenees, in Teneriffe, Iceland, and other\r\ndistricts of high altitude and low temperature, in which the\r\ntemperature even in summer does not rise much above freezing-point, may\r\nbe explained by the theory advanced independently by De Luc and the\r\nRev. G. F. Browne. “The heavy cold air of winter,” writes the latter,\r\n“sinks down into the glacières, and the lighter, warm air of summer\r\ncannot on ordinary principles dislodge it, so that heat is very slowly\r\nspread in the caves; and even when some amount of heat does reach the\r\nice, the latter melts but slowly, since a kilogramme of ice absorbs 79°\r\nC. of heat in melting; and thus when ice is once formed, it becomes a\r\nmaterial guarantee for the permanence of cold in the cave. For this\r\nexplanation to hold good it is necessary that the level at which the\r\nice is found should be below the level of the entrance to the cave;\r\notherwise the mere weight of the cold air would cause it to leave its\r\nprison as soon as the spring warmth arrived.” It is also necessary that\r\nthe cave should be protected from direct radiation and from the action\r\nof wind. These conditions are satisfied by all the glacières explored\r\nby Mr. Browne.[39] The apparent anomaly that one only out of a group\r\nof caves exposed to the same temperatures should be a glacière, may be\r\nexplained by the fact that these conditions are found in combination\r\nbut rarely, and if one were absent there would be no accumulation of\r\nperpetual ice. It is very probable that the store of cold laid up in\r\nthese caves, as in an ice-house, has been ultimately derived from the\r\ngreat refrigeration of climate in Europe in the Glacial Period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have examined the physical history of caves, their\r\nformation, and their relation to pot-holes, cirques, and ravines; and\r\nwe have seen that they are not the result of subterranean disturbance,\r\nbut of the mechanical action of rain-water and the chemical action\r\nof carbonic acid, both operating from above. We have seen that\r\ncave-hunting is not merely an adventurous amusement, but also a quest\r\nthat brings us into a great laboratory, so to speak, in which we can\r\nsee the natural agents at work that have carved out the valleys and\r\ngorges, and shaped the hills wherever the calcareous rocks are to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this treatise will be devoted to the evidence which they\r\noffer as to the former inhabitants, both men and animals, of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHISTORIC CAVES IN BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n  Definition of Historic Period.--Wild Animals in Britain during\r\n    the Historic Period.--Animals living under the care of Man.--\r\n    Classificatory value of Historic Animals.--The Victoria Cave,\r\n    Settle, Yorkshire.--History of Discovery.--The Romano-Celtic or\r\n    Brit-Welsh Stratum.--The Bones of the Animals.--Miscellaneous\r\n    Articles.--The Coins.--The Jewelry, and its Relation to Irish\r\n    Art.--Similar Remains in other Caves in Yorkshire.--These\r\n    Caves used as Places of Refuge.--The evidence of History as to\r\n    Date.--Britain under the Romans.--The Inroads of the Picts and\r\n    Scots.--The English Conquest.--The Neolithic Stratum.--The\r\n    approximate Date of the Neolithic Occupation.--The Grey Clays.\r\n    --The Pleistocene Occupation by the Hyænas.--The probable\r\n    Preglacial Age of the Pleistocene Stratum.--The Kirkhead Cave.\r\n    --Poole’s Cave, near Buxton.--Thor’s Cave, near Ashbourne.--\r\n    Historic value of Brit-Welsh Group of Caves.--Principal Animals\r\n    and Articles.--The use of Horse-flesh.--The Cave of Long-berry\r\n    Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Definition of Historic Period._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter the origin of caves has been discussed, as\r\nwell as their relation to the physical geography of the districts in\r\nwhich they are found. We must now pass on to the biological division\r\nof the subject, which relates to the animals that they contain and the\r\ninferences that may be drawn from their occurrence. The caves will be\r\ndivided into historic, prehistoric, and pleistocene, according to the\r\nprinciples laid down in the first chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to define with precision\r\nthe point where legend ends and history begins; but the line may be\r\ndrawn with convenience at the first beginning of a connected and\r\ncontinuous narrative, rather than at the first isolated notice of a\r\ncountry. If we accept this definition, the historic period in Great\r\nBritain cannot be extended further back than the temporary invasion\r\nof Julius Cæsar, B.C. 55, even if so far, since of the interval that\r\nelapsed between that event and the subjugation under Claudius, in the\r\nyear A.D. 43, we know scarcely anything. Of the events which happened\r\nin this country before Cæsar’s invasion there is no documentary\r\nevidence, although, by the modern method of scientific research, we are\r\nable to extend the narrative away from the borders of history far back\r\ninto the archæological and geological past.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wild Animals in Britain during the Historic Period._\r\n\r\nDuring the historic period great changes have taken place in the\r\nanimals inhabiting Great Britain. The wild animals have been diminished\r\nin number, and their area of occupation has been narrowed by the\r\nincrease of population and the improvement in weapons of destruction.\r\nThe brown bear, inhabiting Britain during the time of the Roman\r\noccupation, was extirpated probably before the tenth century. The\r\ncurrent belief that it was destroyed in Scotland by the founder of\r\nthe Gordon family in 1057 is unsupported by any documentary evidence\r\nwhich I have been able to discover; the crest of the Gordons, which\r\nis supposed to have been derived from the last of those animals slain\r\nin the island, consisting of three boars’, not _bears’_, heads. The\r\nlast wolf is said to have been destroyed in Scotland in 1680, while in\r\nIreland the animal lingered thirty years later to be a terror to the\r\ndefenceless beggars. It was deemed worthy of a special decree for its\r\ndestruction in the reign of Edward I. The wild boar was extinct before\r\nthe reign of Charles I., while the beaver, which was hunted for its fur\r\non the banks of the Teivi in Cardiganshire during the time of the first\r\nCrusade, became extinct shortly afterwards. The stag was so abundant in\r\nthe south of England as recently as the reign of Queen Anne, that she\r\nsaw a herd of no less than five hundred between London and Portsmouth.\r\nAt present the animal lives only in a half-wild condition, in the\r\nforest of Exmoor and the Highlands of Scotland; while the roedeer is\r\nnow only found wild in Scotland, although it formerly ranged throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the country.\r\n\r\nThe reindeer is proved to have been living in Caithness as late as the\r\nyear 1159, by a passage in the Orkneyinga Saga.\r\n\r\nThe common rat, _Mus decumanus_, is the only wild or semi-wild animal\r\nthat has migrated into this country during the historic period contrary\r\nto the will of man. In 1727 it (_Pallas, Glires_) had begun to invade\r\nSouthern Russia from the regions of Persia and the Caspian Sea. Thence\r\nit swiftly spread over Asia Minor, and while it was advancing to the\r\nwest overland, it was carried by ships to nearly all the ports in the\r\nworld. It arrived in Britain certainly before the year 1730, and has\r\nsince nearly exterminated the black indigenous species. It is the only\r\nwild animal which is known to have invaded Europe since the pleistocene\r\nage, with the exception, perhaps, of the true elk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Animals living under the care of Man._\r\n\r\nThe fallow-deer, indigenous in the countries bordering on the\r\nMediterranean, was probably introduced by the Romans, since its remains\r\noccur in refuse-heaps of Roman age, such as that of London Wall, and\r\nof Colchester, while it has not been met with in older deposits. To\r\nthem, also, we probably owe the introduction of the pheasant, which\r\nwas sufficiently abundant in the neighbourhood of London in the time\r\nof Harold to be mentioned as one of the articles of food eaten on\r\nfeast-days by the households of the Canons at Waltham Abbey in 1059.\r\nThe domestic fowl has left the first traces of its presence in this\r\ncountry in the Roman refuse-heaps, although it was known to the Belgæ,\r\naccording to the testimony of Cæsar, before the first Roman invasion.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of the domestic cat in this country is to be\r\nfound in the laws of Howel Dha,[40] that were probably codified at\r\nthe end of the tenth or in the eleventh century, although many of the\r\nenactments may be of a much earlier date. The king’s cat is assessed\r\nat eightpence, or twice as much as that belonging to any subject. The\r\nass[41] was certainly known in Britain in the days of Æthelred (A.D.\r\n866-871), when, according to Professor Bell, its price was fixed at the\r\nlarge sum of twelve shillings. The larger breed of cattle represented\r\nby the Chillingham ox, and descended from the great Urus, first\r\nappears in this country about the time of the English invasion. It\r\ngradually spread over those districts conquered by the English, until\r\nthe small aboriginal dark-coloured, short-horn _Bos longifrons_, which\r\nwas the only domestic breed in the prehistoric and Roman times, is now\r\nonly to be met with in the hill country of Wales and of Scotland, in\r\nwhich the Brit-Welsh or Romano-Celtic inhabitants still survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classificatory value of Historic Animals._\r\n\r\nThe principal changes in the fauna of Great Britain during the historic\r\nage are the extinction of the bear, wolf, beaver, reindeer, and\r\nwild boar, and the introduction of the domestic fowl, the pheasant,\r\nfallow-deer, ass, the domestic cat, the larger breed of oxen, and the\r\ncommon rat; and as this took place at different times, it is obvious\r\nthat these animals enable us to ascertain the approximate date of the\r\ndeposit in which their remains happen to occur. And for this purpose\r\nthe following table[42] may be consulted:--\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS EXTINCT.\r\n\r\n                        A.D.\r\n  Brown bear    circa 500-1000\r\n  Reindeer        ”     1200\r\n  Beaver          ”    11-1200\r\n  Wolf            ”     1680\r\n  Wild boar       ”     1620\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\n  Domestic fowl                      before    55 B.C.\r\n  Fallow-deer                        circa       ”\r\n  Pheasant                             ”         ”\r\n  Domestic ox of Urus type             ”      449 A.D.\r\n  Ass                                  ”     800-850\r\n  Cat                                  ”     800-1000\r\n  Common rat                           ”      1727-30\r\n\r\nSome or other of these animals are met with in the peat-bogs and\r\nalluvia, and in caves, but far more abundantly in the refuse-heaps left\r\nbehind by man, by whom they have here been used either for service or\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of certain wild species, from the areas in which they\r\nlived on the continent, in historic times, has not been ascertained\r\nso accurately as in this country, and many animals, which have become\r\nextinct in our restricted and highly-cultivated island, are still to\r\nbe found in the continental forests, morasses, and mountains. The\r\nbrown bear is still to be met with in the Pyrenees, the Vosges, and\r\nin the wilder and more inaccessible portions of northern, middle, and\r\nsouthern Europe. The wolf still survives in France, and during the late\r\nGerman war preyed upon the slain after some of the battles. It, as well\r\nas the wild boar, ranges throughout the uncultivated regions of the\r\ncontinent. The beaver still lives in the waters of the Rhone, as well\r\nas in the rivers of Lithuania and of Scandinavia, and the reindeer,\r\nnow restricted to the regions north of a line passing east and west\r\nthrough the Baltic, extended further south, in sufficient numbers to\r\nbe remarked by Cæsar, among the more noteworthy animals living in the\r\ngreat Hercynian forest, which overshadowed northern Germany in his\r\ndays. This forest also afforded shelter to the true elk and the bison,\r\nboth of which still live in Lithuania, as well as to the Urus, which\r\nwas hunted by Charles the Great, near Aachen, and probably became\r\nextinct in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. The lion inhabited the\r\nmountains of southern Thrace in the days of Herodotus and of Aristotle,\r\nand became extinct in Europe between 330 B.C. and the days of Dio\r\nChrysostom Rhetor (A.D. 100), who expressly says that there were no\r\nlions in Greece in his time. The panther also inhabited the same\r\ndistrict when Xenophon wrote his “Treatise on Hunting.”\r\n\r\nThe fallow-deer was believed by the late Professor Edouard Lartet to\r\nhave been introduced into France by the Romans. On a visit, however, to\r\nParis in September 1873, Professor Gervais called my attention to an\r\nantler of the animal in the Jardin des Plantes, said to have been found\r\nin a refuse-heap along with axes of polished stone. It must therefore\r\nhave lived in France in the Neolithic age, if it were obtained from an\r\nundisturbed deposit. It gradually spread into Germany and Switzerland,\r\nuntil in the eleventh century it was sufficiently abundant to be\r\nmentioned among the articles of food in a metrical grace of the monks\r\nof St. Gall.\r\n\r\n    “Imbellem damam faciat benedictio summam.”[43]\r\n\r\nThe domestic fowl is to be recognized on Gallic coins before the\r\nRoman invasion, and therefore was probably known at the very dawn of\r\nGallic history. The larger breed of oxen, descended from the Urus\r\ntype, has been known in France, Germany, Lombardy, Scandinavia, and\r\nSwitzerland, in the remote division of the prehistoric age known\r\nas the Neolithic.[44] The buffalo, on the other hand, of the Roman\r\nCampagna, was introduced into Italy, according to Paulus Diaconus, in\r\nthe year 596, and the domestic cat,[45] known to the Greeks from their\r\nintercourse with Egypt, became familiar to the eyes of the inhabitants\r\nof Rome and Constantinople as early as the fourth century after Christ.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the survival of the wolf, the bear, beaver,\r\nreindeer, and the wild boar on the continent at the present time,\r\nthat the chronological table which I have constructed for Britain\r\nis inapplicable to Europe in general. In the present state of our\r\nknowledge of the varying ranges of the animals, it seems impossible to\r\nform any similar scheme.\r\n\r\nThe historic caves are characterized by the presence of some of these\r\nanimals, as well as of coins and pottery, and other articles by which\r\nthe date of their occupation may be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Victoria Cave, Settle, Yorkshire._\r\n\r\nThe most important historic cave in this country is that discovered\r\nby Mr. Joseph Jackson, near Settle, in Yorkshire, on the coronation\r\nday of Queen Victoria, in 1838, and which has therefore been called\r\nthe Victoria Cave. It runs horizontally into the precipitous side of\r\na lonely ravine known as King’s Scar (Fig. 19), at a height of about\r\n1,450 feet above the sea, according to Mr. Tiddeman, and it consists of\r\nthree large ill-defined chambers filled with débris nearly up to the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--View of King’s Scar, Settle, showing the\r\nentrances of the Victoria and Albert Caves (from a photograph). A, B,\r\nVictoria; C, Albert.]\r\n\r\nThe entrances face to the south-west, and open at the bottom of an\r\noverhanging cliff at the point where a scree, or accumulation of\r\nfragments from the cliff above, gradually slopes down to the bottom of\r\nthe valley, about one hundred feet below. When Mr. Jackson made his\r\ndiscovery, he passed inwards through a small entrance,[46] and was\r\nrewarded by finding in the earth on the floor a number of Roman coins,\r\ntogether with ornaments and implements of bronze, and some brooches\r\nof singular taste and beauty, with implements of bone, and large\r\nquantities of broken bones and fragments of pottery. The collection\r\nwas very miscellaneous; for besides iron spear-heads, nails, daggers,\r\nspoon-brooches of bone, spindle-whorls, beads of amber and of glass,\r\nthere were bronze brooches, finger-rings, armlets, bracelets, buckles,\r\nand studs. All were lying pêle-mêle together, side by side with the\r\nbroken bones of the animals, and the whole set of remains, with the\r\nexception of some of the brooches, was of the kind which is usually met\r\nwith in the neighbourhood of Roman camps, cities, and villas which have\r\nbeen sacked.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of Samian ware and Roman pottery scattered through the\r\nmass, as well as coins of Trajan and Constantine, proved further,\r\nthat the cave had been inhabited after the Roman invasion, and not\r\nearlier than the middle of the third century; and the rude imitations\r\nof Roman coins were, according to Mr. Roach Smith,[47] probably in\r\ncirculation for some centuries after the departure of the Romans\r\nfrom Britain.--“And although some of these remains are indicative\r\nof sepulture, yet from the evidence furnished there appears no\r\npositive proof of their having formed part of funereal deposits. A\r\nmore satisfactory conclusion seems to arise in considering that these\r\ncaves (_i.e._ the group) may have been used as places of refuge by the\r\nRomanized Britons during the troublous times at and after the close of\r\nthe fourth century.” This conclusion we shall see fully borne out by\r\nthe evidence subsequently obtained. Mr. Jackson gives the following\r\naccount of the discovery:--\r\n\r\n“The entrance was nearly filled up with rubbish, and overgrown with\r\nnettles. After removing these obstructions, I was obliged to lie down\r\nat full length to get in. The first appearance that struck me on\r\nentering was the large quantity of clay and earth, which seemed as if\r\nwashed in from without, and presented to the view round pieces like\r\nballs of different sizes. Of this clay there must be several hundred\r\nwaggon loads, but abounding more in the first than in the branch caves.\r\nIn some parts a stalagmitic crust has formed, mixed with bones, broken\r\npots, &c. It was on this crust I found the principal part of the coins,\r\nthe other articles being mostly imbedded in the clay. In the other\r\ncaves very little has been found. When we get through the clay, which\r\nis very stiff and deep, we generally find the rock covered with bones,\r\nall broken and presenting the appearance of having been gnawed. The\r\nentrance into the inner cave has been walled up at the sides. In the\r\ninside were several large stones lying near the hole, any one of which\r\nwould have completely blocked it up by merely turning the stone over.\r\nI pulled the wall down, and the aperture was now about a yard wide,\r\nand two feet high. On digging up the clay at about nine or ten inches\r\ndeep, I found the original floor; it was hard and gravelly, and strewed\r\nwith bones, broken pots, and other objects. The roof of the cave was\r\nbeautifully hung with stalactites in various fantastic forms and as\r\nwhite as snow.”[48]\r\n\r\nThe interest in these discoveries led Mr. Denny, Mr. Farrer, and other\r\ngentlemen to examine the superficial stratum from time to time,\r\nuntil, in 1870, Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, Mr. Walter Morrison, Mr.\r\nBirkbeck, and other gentlemen in the neighbourhood formed a committee\r\nfor the investigation of the contents of the cave, which had been\r\nplaced at their disposal by the courtesy of the owner, the late Mr.\r\nStackhouse. They were aided by the assistance of Sir C. Lyell, Sir. J.\r\nLubbock, and Mr. Darwin, Professor Phillips, Mr. Franks, and others,\r\nand by a grant obtained from the British Association, and have carried\r\non the work since that time with comparatively little interruption.\r\nMr. Jackson, the original discoverer, superintended the workmen;\r\nwhile I identified the works of art and the mammalian remains that\r\nwere discovered, and drew up for the committee the reports brought\r\nbefore the British Association in 1870, 1871, and 1872, and before\r\nthe Anthropological Institute in 1871. Mr. Tiddeman also contributed\r\na report on the physical history of the cave, which is printed in the\r\nBritish Association Report for 1872, and subsequently in the Geological\r\nMagazine, January 1873.[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Romano-Celtic or Brit-Welsh Stratum._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Longitudinal Section of Victoria Cave.]\r\n\r\nThe committee resolved not to begin at the entrance which Mr. Jackson\r\ndiscovered in 1838 (Fig. 19 A), but to make a new passage, at a point\r\nwhere daylight could be seen through the chinks of the broken débris,\r\nwhich there prevented access. Ground was broken on a small plateau\r\nin front of this (Figs. 19 B, 20), which, from the sunny aspect and\r\ncommanding view, would naturally be chosen by the dwellers in the\r\ncave as their more usual place for eating and lounging, and in which\r\nwe might therefore expect to find the remains of whatever they had\r\ndropped or lost. The gloomy recesses of a cave, indeed, even if\r\nlit up by large fires or by torches, are not fitted for any other\r\npurpose than for sleeping or concealment; and if we add in this case\r\nthe damp cold clay under foot and the constant drip of the water\r\noverhead, it was only reasonable to infer that most of their life\r\nwas spent out of doors, and that the cave was used merely as a place\r\nof retirement for shelter. As the trench progressed we dug first of\r\nall through a thickness of two feet (Figs. 20, 21) of angular blocks\r\nof limestone, that had fallen from the cliff above, and that rested\r\non a black layer (No. 4) containing the kind of remains which we had\r\nexpected. The layer was composed of fragments of bone and charcoal,\r\nsurrounding the burnt stones which had formed the ancient hearths,\r\nand contained large quantities of the broken bones of animals which\r\nhad been used for food, and coins and articles of luxury, as well as\r\nthose instruments which were more naturally suited for the half-savage\r\nlife of dwellers in caves. As we opened out the new mouth, the angular\r\nfragments disappeared and the black layer rose to the surface,\r\ncomposing the floor, and lying in some places beneath enormous blocks\r\nof limestone which had fallen from the roof since its accumulation, and\r\nbeing continuous with the layer in which Mr. Jackson first made his\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Vertical Section at the Entrance to the\r\nVictoria Cave.]\r\n\r\nIt was evident that this stratum had been formed during the sojourn of\r\nman in the cave, and we shall find, in the examination of the remains\r\nwhich it furnished, proof that it is connected with the obscure history\r\nof Britain during the fifth and sixth centuries. We will take each\r\ngroup of objects in its proper class, beginning with what at first\r\nsight seems the least promising, the broken bones of the animals that\r\nsupplied the inhabitants with food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bones of the Animals._\r\n\r\nThe bones of the Celtic short-horn (_Bos longifrons_) were very\r\nabundant, and proved that a variety of ox, indistinguishable from the\r\nsmall dark mountain cattle of Wales and Scotland, was the chief food\r\nof the inhabitants. A variety of the goat with simple recurved horns,\r\nwhich is commonly met with in the Yorkshire tumuli explored by Canon\r\nGreenwell, and in the deposits round Roman villas in Great Britain,\r\nfurnished the mutton; while the pork was supplied by a domestic breed\r\nof pigs with small canines; and since the bones of the last animal\r\nbelong for the most part to young individuals, it is clear that the\r\nyoung porker was preferred to the older animal. The bill of fare was\r\noccasionally varied by the use of horse-flesh, which formed a common\r\narticle of food in this country down to the ninth century. To this list\r\nmust be added the venison of the roedeer and stag, but the remains of\r\nthese two animals were singularly rare. Two spurs of the domestic fowl,\r\nand a few bones of wild duck and grouse, complete the list of animals\r\nwhich can with certainty be affirmed to have been eaten by the dwellers\r\nin the cave. The numerous unbroken bones, some very gigantic, of the\r\nbadger, and those of the fox, wildcat, hare, and water-vole, commonly\r\ncalled water-rat, have probably been introduced subsequently, from\r\nthose animals having used the cave as a place of shelter. There were\r\nalso bones of the dog, which from their unbroken condition proved that\r\nthe animal had not been used for food, as it certainly was used by\r\nthe men who lived in the caves of Denbighshire in the Neolithic age.\r\nThe whole group of remains implies that the dwellers in the Victoria\r\nCave lived upon their flocks and herds, rather than by the chase. And\r\nsince the domestic fowl was not known in Britain until about the time\r\nof the Roman invasion, the presence of its remains fixes the date of\r\nthe occupation as not earlier than that time. On the other hand, since\r\nthe small Celtic short-horn (_Bos longifrons_) was the only domestic\r\nox in use known in Roman Britain, and since it disappeared from those\r\nportions of the country which were conquered by the English, along\r\nwith its Celtic possessors, the date is fixed in the other direction\r\nas being not much later than the Northumbrian conquest of that portion\r\nof Yorkshire. I shall return to this part of the subject presently;\r\nhere I will only remark, that the present distribution of the lineal\r\ndescendants of the Celtic short-horn, the small, dark-coloured Scotch\r\nand Welsh cattle, corresponds with those regions on which the Celtic\r\npopulation fell back before the English. And its survival in Wales, and\r\nuntil comparatively recently in Cornwall, Cumberland, and Westmoreland,\r\nmay be accounted for by the fact, that in those districts the Celtic\r\npopulations of Roman Britain were not displaced by the English\r\ninvaders.[50]\r\n\r\nThe larger breed of cattle known in its purity as the white ox of\r\nChillingham, from which all our purely English breeds have been\r\nderived, was imported originally by the English, and spread over the\r\nwhole country which they occupied, until at last the smaller and more\r\nancient oxen survived only in a few isolated areas in the north and\r\nwest of Britain. This displacement of the Celtic short-horn by the\r\nEnglish oxen of the Urus type corroborates, in a striking degree, the\r\ntruth of Mr. Freeman’s view of the ruthless destruction of everything\r\nRoman and Celtic at the hands of the English. It is clear, therefore,\r\nthat from the examination of the bones we may infer that the cave was\r\noccupied before the Celtic short-horn was supplanted in this district\r\nby the larger domestic breed of oxen, and after the introduction of the\r\ndomestic fowl, that is to say, in the interval which elapsed between\r\nthe Roman and English invasions.\r\n\r\nWe must now treat of the remains of man’s handiwork in the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Articles._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Spoon-brooch (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThe ornaments and implements of bone consist of carefully smoothed\r\npins, and points intended to be fitted to a handle, knife-handles made\r\nof bone and antler; three spindle-whorls made of the perforated head\r\nof a femur; a stud; a perfect spoon-shaped fibula (Fig. 22), which\r\ncorresponds with one of those in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy,\r\nas well as several fragments, and which when in use was passed through\r\nholes in the clothes, in such a manner that the two ends alone were\r\nvisible. These are ornamented, and the shaft and the whole back is more\r\nor less polished by wear. Eight articles bear a close resemblance to\r\nthe handles of gimlets (Figs. 23, 24), and most probably have been\r\nused as studs, or links, for fastening together clothing. The fact,\r\nindeed, that some have the central hole worn by the friction of a thong\r\nor string of some kind, coupled with the worn state of some of their\r\nsurfaces, renders this guess very likely to be true. In Fig. 24, _a_,\r\nthe ornament in right lines, which once covered the surface as in Fig.\r\n24, _b_, is very nearly obliterated by friction against some soft body\r\nsuch as clothing. A reference to the figures will give a better idea of\r\ntheir shape and ornamentation than a mere description. Two perforated\r\ndiscs may have been used as studs. There are also many nondescript\r\narticles, consisting of sockets made of antler of stag, and bone rods\r\ncarefully rounded, together with cut bones of uncertain use. For the\r\nidentification of the ivory boss of a sword-hilt I am indebted to the\r\nkindness of Mr. Franks.\r\n\r\nBesides the ornaments in bone and antler, there were seven glass beads,\r\nfive transparent and two of a bluish tint, and one of jet turned in\r\na lathe; as well as a fragment of a jet bracelet. Among the articles\r\nof daily use were many rounded pebbles, with marks of fire upon them,\r\nwhich had probably been heated for the purpose of boiling water.\r\nPot-boilers, as they are called, of this kind are used by many savage\r\npeoples at the present day, and if we wished to heat water in a vessel\r\nthat would not stand the fire, we should be obliged to employ a similar\r\nmethod. Other stones formed parts of ancient hearths, and two or three\r\ngrooved slabs of sandstone had evidently been used for rounding and\r\nsharpening bone pins. The fragments of pottery were very abundant, and\r\nwere all of the type usually found round Roman villas. One fragment of\r\nSamian ware was ornamented with the representation of a hunt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Ornamented Bone-fastener (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Two Bone-links; _a_ worn, _b_ unworn (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\nThis group of articles throws but little light on the date of the\r\noccupation of the cave. The Samian ware, and the ivory boss of a Roman\r\nsword, merely imply that it was either Roman or post-Roman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Coins._\r\n\r\nIf we turn now to the coins, we shall find the date to lie within\r\nnarrower limits than those fixed by the animals. They consist of:--\r\n\r\n    Two silver of Trajan, d. 117.\r\n    Four bronze of Tetricus I., 267-274.\r\n    One bronze of Tetricus II., 267-274.\r\n    One bronze of Gallienus, d. 268.\r\n    One bronze of Constantine II., d. 343.\r\n    One bronze of Constans, d. 353.\r\n    Three barbarous imitations in bronze of coins of Tetricus,\r\n        circa 400-500 A.D.\r\n\r\nIn a group of coins such as this the latest only give a clue to the\r\ndate, since the earlier may have remained in circulation long after\r\nthey were struck. In India, for example, those of Alexander the Great\r\nhave not yet disappeared from the country, and in Spain, in the shops\r\nof Malaga, Moorish, Roman, and even Phœnician coins were current in\r\n1863, as well as all those which have been struck since.[51] We may\r\ntherefore disregard the earliest coins, and fix our attention more\r\nparticularly on those of the Constantine family, and the bronze minimi\r\nmentioned last in the list. The presence of the coin of Constans\r\nimplies that the cave was occupied either during or after 337 A.D.,\r\nwhen he ascended the throne; while the date of the minimi has not been\r\nascertained with accuracy. “They abound upon all Roman sites, such as\r\nVerulam and Richborough. In size they come nearest to those struck\r\nunder Arcadius and his successors, and I think that you will not be\r\nfar wrong in assigning them to the first half of the fifth century.\r\nThe latest of the genuine Roman coins found in this country are those\r\nof Arcadius and Honorius; at least, the finding of any of later date\r\nis quite exceptional. What the currency was between that time and the\r\ncommencement of the Saxon coinage it is hard to say. It seems probable,\r\nhowever, that gold and silver had nearly disappeared, and that the\r\nneeds of a small local commerce were supplied by the Roman copper\r\ncoins of which abundance remained in the country, and by small pieces\r\nstruck after their model, not improbably by private speculators.” This\r\nopinion, which Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., has been kind enough to write\r\nme, coincides with that of Mr. Newton, as well as that of Mr. Roach\r\nSmith; and we may therefore assume, with tolerable certainty, that\r\nthe cave was inhabited during the first half of the fifth century or\r\nafterwards, at a time when the withdrawal of the Roman Legions had left\r\nthe colony of Britain, whose youth and vigour had been consumed in the\r\nfierce struggle of the rivals for the throne of the West, a prey to the\r\nbarbarian invaders.\r\n\r\nIt is of course conceivable that some of these coins may have been\r\ndropped at one time, and some at another, but nevertheless it seems\r\nvery probable that the whole accumulation belongs to the same relative\r\nage. But whether this be accepted or not, it is certain the cave was\r\ninhabited during the time that the minimi were in circulation,--that is\r\nto say, during the first half of the fifth century, or from that time\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Jewellery, and its Relation to Irish Art._\r\n\r\nThis conclusion as to the date, derived from the coins, is confirmed\r\nin a remarkable degree by the examination of the articles of\r\nluxury. Besides two bronze brooches of the Roman pattern, known by\r\narchæologists as harp-shaped (Coloured Plate, fig. 5), was one of the\r\nsplit-ring type, with a moveable pin, which is generally assigned to\r\nthe later period of the Roman occupation of this country. One type\r\nof brooch was composed of two circular plates of bronze, soldered\r\ntogether, the front being very thin and bearing flamboyant and spiral\r\npatterns in relief (Fig. 25), of admirable design and execution. The\r\noriginal of the figure was discovered by Mr. Jackson, and is more\r\nperfect than any of those which we obtained in our excavations. It\r\nis altogether unlike any Roman brooch properly so called, both in\r\nits composite make and style of ornament. A similar brooch has been\r\ndiscovered at Brough Castle, in Westmoreland, and was figured in the\r\nProceedings of the Antiquarian Society (vol. iv. 129), by Sir James\r\nMusgrave, and a second is preserved in the Museum of the Royal Irish\r\nAcademy (492). The style corresponds with that of a medallion on a\r\nRunic casket of silver-bronze, figured by Prof. Stevens, and stated\r\nto have been obtained from Northumbrian Britain, as well as that of a\r\nbrooch in the Museum at Mainz, assigned by the same authority to the\r\nthird or fourth century. It is also to be met with in the illuminations\r\nof one of the Anglo-Saxon Gospels at Stockholm, as well as in those\r\nof the Gospels of S. Columban, preserved in the library of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, and in the “Book of Kells” (8-900).[52] In all these\r\ncases it cannot be affirmed to be Roman, and it is not presented by\r\nornaments of either purely English or Teutonic origin. It is most\r\nclosely allied to that work which is termed by Mr. Franks “late\r\nCeltic.” From its localization in Britain and Ireland, it seems to be\r\nprobable that it is of Celtic derivation; and if this view be accepted,\r\nthere is nothing at all extraordinary in its being recognized in the\r\nilluminated Irish Gospels. Ireland, in the sixth and seventh centuries,\r\nwas the great centre of art, civilization, and literature; and it is\r\nonly reasonable to suppose that there would be intercourse between\r\nthe Irish Christians and those of the west of Britain during the time\r\nthat the Romano-Celts, or Brit-Welsh, were being slowly pushed to the\r\nwestward by the heathen English invader. Proof of such an intercourse\r\nwe find in the brief notice in the “Annales Cambriæ,” in which Gildas,\r\nthe Brit-Welsh historian, is stated to have sailed over to Ireland in\r\nthe year A.D. 565. It is by no means improbable that about this time\r\nthere was a Brit-Welsh migration into Ireland, as well as into Brittany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Bronze Brooch (natural size).]\r\n\r\nNor is it at all strange that the same style of ornament should occur\r\nin some few cases in North Germany.\r\n\r\n“The conquest of Britain,” writes the Rev. J. R. Green (“History of the\r\nEnglish People,” p. 16[53]), “had thrust a wedge of heathendom into\r\nthe heart of the Western Church. On the one side lay Italy and Gaul,\r\nwhose Churches owned obedience to the see of Rome, on the other the\r\nfree Celtic Church of Ireland. But the condition of the two portions\r\nof Western Christendom was very different. While the vigour of Latin\r\nChristianity was exhausted in a bare struggle for life, Ireland as yet\r\nunscourged by invaders had drawn from its conversion an energy such as\r\nit has never known since. Christianity had been received there with\r\na burst of popular enthusiasm. Letters and arts sprang up rapidly in\r\nits train; the science and Biblical knowledge which had fled from the\r\ncontinent took refuge in famous schools which made Durrow and Armagh\r\nthe universities of the West. The new life soon beat too strongly to\r\nbrook confinement within insular bounds. Patrick, the first missionary\r\nof Ireland, had not been half a century dead, when Celtic Christianity\r\nflung itself with a fiery zeal into battle with the mass of heathenism\r\nwhich had rolled in upon the Christian world. Irish missionaries\r\nlaboured among the Picts of the Highlands, among the Frisians of\r\nthe northern seas; Columban founded monasteries in Burgundy and the\r\nApennines; the canton of St. Gall still commemorates in its name the\r\nmissionary before whom the spirits of flood and fell fled wailing over\r\nthe waters of the Lake of Constance. For a time it seemed as if the\r\ncourse of the world’s history was to be changed, as if the older race\r\nthat Roman and Teuton had swept before them had turned to the moral\r\nconquest of its conquerors, as if Celtic and not Latin Christianity was\r\nto mould the destinies of the Churches of the West.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that Irish-Celtic art should not have made itself\r\nfelt wherever the Irish missionaries penetrated, and especially\r\nin the gorgeous illuminated Gospels, which it was the pride of S.\r\nColumban and his school to have made, and which now excite our wonder\r\nand admiration. The early Christian art in Ireland grew out of the\r\nlate Celtic, and was, to a great extent, free from the influence of\r\nRome, which is stamped on the Brit-Welsh art of the same age in this\r\ncountry. The style, therefore, of these circular brooches, from its\r\ncorrespondence with that of the Irish illuminated gospels, affords\r\nreasonable grounds for the belief that the Victoria Cave was inhabited\r\nin the sixth century, or possibly later, but before the English\r\ninvaders had swept the Brit-Welsh away from the district.\r\n\r\nTwo other brooches were also discovered in the black layer, which are\r\neven of greater interest than those which have just been described.\r\nThe one represents a dragon (colored Plate, fig. 3), with its eye made\r\nof red enamel; the other (colored Plate, fig. 7) shaped, like the\r\nletter S, has its front composed of an elaborate cloissonnée pattern\r\nin red, blue, and yellow enamels, and is of the same design as two\r\nbrooches in the British Museum, discovered, one near Whittington Hill,\r\nin Gloucestershire, and the other near Malton, in Yorkshire. All three\r\nwere, undoubtedly, turned out of the same artistic school, and they may\r\nhave been made by one workman. The enamel, in all these examples, seems\r\nto have been inserted into hollows in the bronze, and then to have\r\nbeen heated so as to form a close union with them, and in some cases\r\nwhere it has been broken, as in colored Plate, fig. 7, small fragments\r\nstill remain to attest the completeness of the fusion with the bronze.\r\nThe style of workmanship is neither Roman nor Teutonic. An enamelled\r\nfibula with spirals in relief, found at Reichenbach[54] (Soleure) in\r\na post-Roman sepulchre, and figured by Bonstettin, is of a similar\r\ndesign, and it may be traced also in two brooches obtained by the Abbé\r\nCochet, from the Merovingian Cemetery of Envermeu,[55] although they\r\nare of more massive and square construction than those of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nOne harp-shaped brooch (colored Plate, fig. 1) is ornamented with\r\ndiamonds of blue enamel, separated by small triangles of red, and shows\r\nin its Roman design and Celtic ornamentation the union between Celtic\r\nand Roman art. A similar specimen from Brough Castle, Westmoreland, is\r\npreserved in the British Museum, and may have been turned out of the\r\nsame workshop. We also met with an enamelled disk (colored Plate, fig.\r\n6), and a finger-ring (fig. 4) of bronze-gilt, ornamented with blue\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nSeveral enamelled fibulæ in the British Museum, obtained by Sir James\r\nMusgrave, at Kirby Thore, Westmoreland, belong to the same style of art\r\nas those of the Victoria cave, and were associated with the same class\r\nof remains. Shields,[56] scabbards, horse trappings, and other articles\r\nhave also been discovered in this county, decorated in the same fashion\r\nwith coloured enamels, and especially a bronze vase from the late Roman\r\ntumuli, called the Bartlow Hills. They all belong to the class termed\r\n“late Celtic” by Mr. Franks, and are considered by him to be of British\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThis view is supported by the only reference to the art of enamelling\r\nwhich is furnished by the classical writers. Philostratus, a Greek\r\nsophist, who left Athens in the beginning of the third century to join\r\nthe Court of Julia Domna, the wife of the Emperor Severus, writes:--“It\r\nis said that the barbarians living in or by the ocean, pour these\r\ncolors (those of the horse trappings) on heated bronze, that these\r\nadhere, grow as hard as stone, and preserve the designs that are made\r\nin them.”[57] Mr. Franks’ opinion that this passage relates to Britain,\r\nseems to be more probable than that of the eminent French archæologist,\r\nM. de Laborde, who holds that it relates to Gaul and especially to\r\n“Belgica.”[58]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the variety of enamelled objects which have been\r\ndiscovered in the north of England, it seems to be by no means\r\nimprobable that the principal centre of the art enamelling was\r\nhere rather than in the south; and this conclusion is considerably\r\nstrengthened by the fact that under the Romans political power centered\r\nin the district between the Humber and the Tyne, and that York, and not\r\nLondon, was the capital of Britain and the seat of the Roman Prefect.\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that since the Emperor Severus built the wall\r\nwhich bears his name, marched in person against the Caledonians, and\r\ndied at York, the account of the enamels may have been brought to the\r\ncourt of the Empress Julia from this very region, and thus come to be\r\nrecorded by Philostratus.\r\n\r\nTwo harp-shaped fibulæ, obtained by Mr. Jackson from the Victoria\r\ncave, and ornamented with enamel, are coated with silver, and in one\r\nof them two small blocks of that metal still remain firmly imbedded in\r\nthe bronze. It is very probable that most of the ornaments were plated\r\neither with silver or gold, traces of which, in some cases, still\r\nremain.\r\n\r\nAmong the miscellaneous objects in metal are a bronze wire brooch\r\n(colored Plate, fig. 8), two bracelets, composed of twisted bronze-gilt\r\nwire; and one fragment in solid bronze, ornamented with right lines;\r\none plain bronze finger-ring; two small buckles, respectively of bronze\r\nand of iron, and a small bronze flattened pin (colored Plate, fig. 2),\r\nending in two points to which, at first, we were unable to assign a\r\nuse. When, however, the two points were compared with the circles on\r\nthe ornaments of bone (Fig. 22), there was but little doubt that this\r\ncurious object was employed as a pair of fixed compasses. There were\r\nalso iron articles which were too much corroded to admit of a guess at\r\ntheir probable use, besides a Roman key, knife-blades, and a spear-head\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe number of ornaments found in the Victoria Cave from time to time\r\nby various explorers is very considerable. They are scattered in the\r\nprivate collections of Messrs. Jackson and Eckroyd Smith, and in the\r\nMuseums of Giggleswick Grammar-school, and of Leeds, and the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Similar remains in other Caves in Yorkshire._\r\n\r\nThe Victoria cave is by no means the only one in the district that\r\nhas furnished works of art and the remains of animals. The Albert\r\ncave (Fig. 19, _c_.) close by is, as yet, only explored sufficiently\r\nto prove that it contains the same kind of objects; and from that\r\nof Kelko, overlooking Giggleswick, they have been obtained by Mr.\r\nJackson;[59] as well as from that of Dowker-bottom between Arncliffe\r\nand Kilnsay, by Mr. James Farrer and Mr. Denny.[60] From the last,\r\nseven spoon-shaped brooches of bone, and two spindle-whorls of Samian\r\nware of the bottom of a vase, are preserved in the British Museum, as\r\nwell as a bronze needle, and brooches both harp-shaped and discoid,\r\nand fragments of pottery. Three coins in bronze, according to Mr.\r\nFarrer,[61] prove that the date of the accumulation is late or\r\npost-Roman, one being of Claudius Gothicus, whose reign ended A.D. 270,\r\nand two belonging to the Tetrici, A.D. 267-273, since they would remain\r\nin circulation for some time after they were struck. A bronze pin, in\r\nthe possession of Mr. Jackson, from Dowker-bottom, is remarkable for\r\nthe head being plated with silver.\r\n\r\nThe fragment of flattened antler from this cave, referred by Mr. Denny\r\nto the elk, most probably belongs to the crown of an old antler of the\r\nstag, and the remains of the “Canis primævus” of that author cannot be\r\ndistinguished from those of a large dog. The bones of the wolf, and an\r\nenormous stag in the Museum of the Philosophical Society at Leeds, are\r\nprobably much older than the Brit-Welsh stratum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_These Caves used as Places of Refuge._\r\n\r\nThe presence of these works of art, in association with the remains\r\nof the domestic animals used for food, is only to be satisfactorily\r\naccounted for in the way proposed by Mr. Dixon. Men accustomed to\r\nluxury and refinement were compelled, by the pressure of some great\r\ncalamity, to flee for refuge, and to lead a half-savage life in\r\nthese inclement caves, with whatever they could transport thither\r\nof their property. They were also accompanied by their families, for\r\nthe number of personal ornaments and the spindle-whorls imply the\r\npresence of the female sex. We may also infer that they were cut off\r\nfrom the civilization to which they had been accustomed, since they\r\nwere compelled to extemporize spindle-whorls out of the pieces of the\r\nvessels that they brought with them, instead of using those which had\r\nbeen manufactured for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The evidence of History as to the Date._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen from the examination of the coins, that the\r\nVictoria cave was occupied during or after the first half of the fifth\r\ncentury, and from the works of art that it may have been, and probably\r\nwas, occupied at a later time. To fix the latest possible limit to the\r\noccupation of the group of caves to which it belongs, we must appeal to\r\ncontemporary history.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four centuries of Roman dominion in Britain, the\r\nspread of the manners and arts of the great mistress of the world\r\nfollowed close upon her success in arms; and the policy of one of the\r\ngreatest of her generals, Agricola, bore fruit in the adoption of her\r\ncivilization by the British provincials. The population clustered\r\nround the Roman stations, and cities sprang up, such as Chester, Bath,\r\nYork, and Lincoln, between which a ready communication was maintained\r\nby the roads that still remain as monuments of engineering skill, and\r\nwhich, in many cases, have been used uninterruptedly from that time to\r\nthe present day. Agriculture was carried on to such an extent, that\r\nBritain became one of the principal corn-producing regions of the Roman\r\nEmpire; and a commerce with foreign countries was carried on from\r\nthe ports on the banks of the Thames and the Severn (Gildas, i.).\r\nThe mineral sources were also fully explored; tin was sought in the\r\nmines of Cornwall, lead in those of Derbyshire and Somersetshire, and\r\niron in the forest of Dean, Sussex, and Northumberland. Nor was this\r\nmaterial prosperity unaccompanied by the signs of luxury and culture.\r\nNumerous villas were dotted throughout the province, resembling in size\r\nand plan the quadrangle of a mediæval college at Oxford or Cambridge,\r\nand even in ruins astonishing us by their magnitude and the beauty\r\nof their tessellated pavements. York was the capital of the province\r\nand the centre of government, and consequently Yorkshire must have\r\nbeen, if anything, more completely penetrated with the Roman arts and\r\ncivilization than any other part of Britain. The relation of the Roman\r\nconquerors to the conquered Celtic inhabitants was somewhat analogous\r\nto that which now exists between the English and the subject nations\r\nin India. Latin was the language spoken by the higher classes in the\r\ncities, of the army, and probably of the courts of law; while in the\r\ncountry the Celtic tongue held its ground, and still survives in the\r\nlanguage of Wales. Christianity was probably professed in this country\r\nabout the time of Constantine, and became the dominant religion by the\r\nmiddle of the fifth century, if not before.\r\n\r\nUnderneath all the outward signs of prosperity during the Roman rule\r\nin Britain, there were causes at work which ensured the ruin of the\r\nprovince. The policy of centralization, and the very perfection of\r\nthe machinery for government on autocratic principles, which brought\r\nabout the destruction of the Roman Empire, as in our own days they have\r\nnearly ruined France, bore fruit in Britain in the helpless apathy of\r\nthe provincials when the machinery was broken up. It is therefore no\r\nwonder that when the Roman garrison was finally withdrawn from this\r\ncountry, in the year 409, the provincials were left an easy prey to\r\ntheir enemies. Nor need we wonder that they set up isolated centres of\r\ngovernment, which we may term communes, in the year 410, in which each\r\ncity stood out for itself, instead of combining together for the common\r\nweal. From this time forward the inhabitants of the Roman province\r\nof Britain, severed from the Roman Empire, became a prey to the many\r\ntyrants who sprang up, and the anarchy followed so pathetically\r\ndescribed by Gildas. It was at this time that the coinage became\r\ndebased, and Roman coins afforded the patterns for the small bronze\r\nminimi of the Settle cave,[62] which are so abundant among the ruins of\r\nRoman cities in this country, such as St. Alban’s.\r\n\r\nThe invaders of Britain must now be considered. The Picts and Scots\r\nhad secured a rude liberty under the protection of their mountains\r\nand morasses, rather than by their success in arms against the Roman\r\nlegions, and their raids into the Roman province had been curbed by the\r\nwalls and lines of forts, extending, the one from the Firth of Forth\r\nto the Firth of Clyde, the other from the Solway Firth to the Tyne.\r\nIn spite of these, however, from time to time, in the fourth century,\r\nthey carried desolation into Northumberland and Yorkshire, even if they\r\ndid not penetrate farther into the south. And on the withdrawal of the\r\nRoman legions, at the beginning of the fifth century, their raids were\r\norganized on a much larger scale. In the pages of Gildas we have a\r\nmelancholy picture of their results. In the letter written to Ætius,\r\nthe Roman commander in Gaul, in 446, the Britains are described as\r\nsheep, and the Picts and Scots as wolves. “The barbarians drive us back\r\nto the sea; the sea drives us back again to perish at the hands of the\r\nbarbarians,” are the words put into the mouth of the embassy.[63] One\r\nplea for aid, which they advanced, is especially interesting, because\r\nit shows incidentally that the Roman civilization did not disappear\r\nwith the withdrawal of the legions--the plea that unless they were\r\nsuccoured the name of Rome would be dishonoured. Nerved by despair, the\r\nBritish in the following year take up arms, and, according to Gildas,\r\nleave their houses and lands, and taking shelter in mountains and\r\nforests, and in caves,[64] succeed in driving back their Pictish and\r\nScottish enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is very significant that _caves_ should be mentioned in this\r\naccount; for the region of Craven is one of the very few in the country\r\nin which they are sufficiently abundant to allow of their being used\r\nas places of shelter on a scale sufficiently large to be recorded in\r\nhistory; and when we consider that one of the natural highways from\r\nScotland into central England lies through that district, it seems to\r\nme extremely probable that the group of caves of which Victoria is\r\none is that referred to. On this point it is worthy of record, that\r\nin the year 1745, when the younger Pretender was at Shap, and it was\r\ndoubtful whether he would take the route through Ribblesdale or by way\r\nof Preston, the eldest son of one of the landowners near Settle, was\r\nhidden, along with the family plate, in a Cave close to the Victoria,\r\nin the belief that the Highlanders were in the habit of eating children\r\nas well as of laying hands on the precious metals. The historical\r\nnotice tallies exactly with the geographical position, and is not\r\ninconsistent with the evidence offered by the coins and other remains.\r\nThe date, therefore, of the occupation may probably be assigned as\r\nabout the middle of the fifth century.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the latest date that can be assigned. In the year\r\n449, the three ships which contained Hengist and his warriors, landed\r\nat Ebbsfleet, in Thanet, and the first English colony was founded\r\namong a people who were known to the strangers as “Brit-Welsh.”[65]\r\nFrom that time a steady immigration of Angle, Jute, Saxon, and Frisian\r\nset in towards the eastern coast of Britain, as far north as the\r\nFirth of Forth, until, in the first half of the sixth century, the\r\nwhole of the eastern part of our island was taken possession of by\r\nvarious tribes,[66] whose names, for the most part, still survive in\r\nthe names of our counties. The principal rivers also afforded them a\r\nfree passage into the heart of the country, and the kingdom of Mercia\r\ngradually expanded until it embraced, not only the basin of the Trent,\r\nbut reached as far as the line of the Severn. The river Humber afforded\r\na base of operations for the Anglian freebooters, who founded the\r\nkingdom of Deira or modern Yorkshire; while the camp of Bamborough\r\nwas the centre from which Ida, who landed with fifty ships in the\r\nyear 547, conquered Bernicia, or the region extending from the river\r\nTees to Edinburgh. The tide of English colonization rolled steadily\r\nwestward, until, at the close of the sixth century, the hilly and\r\nimpassable districts culminating in the Pennine Chain, and extending\r\nsouthwards from Cumberland and Westmoreland, through Yorkshire and\r\nDerbyshire, formed the barrier between the Brit-Welsh kingdoms of Elmet\r\nand Strathclyde on the east, and the English on the west. To the south\r\nof this the Brit-Welsh dominion was bounded by the river Severn, and\r\nincluded Chester and the whole of the basin of the Dee; while Somerset,\r\nDevon, and Cornwall, and the district round Bradford and Malmesbury\r\nformed the kingdom of West Wales.[67]\r\n\r\nThe long war by which the borders of England were gradually pushed to\r\nthe west, at the expense of the Brit-Welsh, was one of the most fearful\r\nof which we have any record. The English invaders came over, with\r\ntheir wives and children and household stuff, in such force that the\r\ncountry which they left behind was left desolate for several centuries.\r\nWorshippers of Thor and Odin, and living a free life, equally\r\ndivided between farming, hunting, and war, they were mortal foes to\r\nChristianity and to Roman civilization. They destroyed the Brit-Welsh\r\ncities with fire and sword; and the ashes of the Roman villas, which\r\nare to be found in nearly every part of the Roman province of Britain,\r\ntestify to the keenness of their hate to everything which was at once\r\nChristian, Roman, and Celtic. Gildas forcibly describes the destruction\r\nwhich they wrought among his countrymen, by the metaphor that “the\r\nflame kindled in the east, raged over nearly all the land, until it\r\nflared red over the western ocean.”[68] In the conquered districts the\r\nBrit-Welsh were either exterminated or enslaved, and their civilization\r\nwas wholly replaced by the rude culture of the English.\r\n\r\nIt follows, from the nature of this conquest, that any group of\r\nremains, such as those in the caves under consideration, must be\r\nassigned to the time before the English had possession of the district,\r\nand we must therefore see what historical proof is to be found on the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixth century the Brit-Welsh kingdom of Elmet\r\n(in the basin of the river Aire)--a name which still survives in\r\nBarwick-in-Elmet, a little village about seven miles to the north-east\r\nof Leeds--extended over the country round Leeds and Bradford, passing\r\nwestwards towards, if not into, Lancashire, and northwards probably\r\nso as to embrace Ribblesdale, and forming a barrier to the westward\r\nadvance of the English possessors of eastern Yorkshire. Its downfall\r\nwill give us the latest possible limit which we are seeking for the\r\nBrit-Welsh occupation of the Victoria Cave. The two kingdoms of Deira\r\nand Bernicia had united to form the powerful state of Northumbria,\r\nat the beginning of the seventh century, under Æthelfrith, who\r\ncarried on the war against the Brit-Welsh with greater vigour than\r\nhis predecessors. In 607[69] he marched along the line of the\r\nTrent, through Staffordshire, avoiding thereby the difficult and\r\neasily-defended hilly country of Derbyshire and East Lancashire, to\r\nthe battle near Chester, famous for the destruction of the power of\r\nStrathclyde, and the death of the monks of Bangor, who fought against\r\nhim with their prayers. By this decisive blow, the English first set\r\nfoot on the coast of the Irish Channel, and Strathclyde and Elmet, on\r\nthe one hand, were cut asunder from Wales. On the other Chester was\r\nso thoroughly destroyed that it remained in ruins for nearly three\r\ncenturies, to be rebuilt by Æthelflæd, “the Lady of the Mercians,” in\r\n907, and the plains of Lancashire lay open to the invader.[70] This\r\nwestern advance of the Northumbrians was completed by the conquest of\r\nElmet, in 616, by Eadwine, and the whole district from Edinburgh, as\r\nfar south as the Humber, and as far west as Chester, became subject to\r\nhis rule.[71] The latest possible date, therefore, that can be assigned\r\nfor the occupation of these caves by the Brit-Welsh is determined by\r\nthat event. It cannot be later than the first quarter of the seventh\r\ncentury, or the time when what remained of Roman art and civilization\r\nin that district was swept away by the ancestors of the present\r\ndalesmen. The relics in the caves must have been accumulated in the two\r\ncenturies which elapsed between the recall of the legions in the days\r\nof Honorius and the English conquest. They are traces of the anarchy\r\nwhich existed in those times, and they tell a tale of woe, wrought on\r\nthe Brit-Welsh, by Pict, Scot, or Englishman, as eloquently as the\r\nlament of Gildas, or the mournful verses of Talliesin. They complete\r\nthe picture of the desolation of those times revealed by the ashes of\r\nthe villas and cities which were burned by the invaders.\r\n\r\nWe have now examined the evidence as to date offered by the contents\r\nof these caves, and we have seen that it agrees with the contemporary\r\nhistory. It may therefore be concluded that it lies in the fifth and\r\nsixth centuries, possibly the first quarter of the seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Neolithic Stratum._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Bone Harpoon (natural size).]\r\n\r\nThis occupation of the Victoria Cave by the Brit-Welsh is a mere\r\nepisode in its history. It was inhabited by man in the neolithic age,\r\nat a time so remote that the interval between it and the historical\r\nperiod can only be measured by the rude method by which geologists\r\nestimate the relative age of the rocks. At the entrance the dark\r\nRomano-Celtic or Brit-Welsh stratum (Fig. 20, No. 4; Fig. 21, No. 4)\r\nlay buried, as we have seen, under an accumulation of angular fragments\r\nof stone which had fallen from the cliff. It rested on a similar\r\naccumulation (Fig. 20, No. 3; Fig. 21, No. 3) which was no less than\r\nsix feet thick, and at the bottom of this, at the point where it was\r\nbased on a stiff grey clay, a bone harpoon (Fig. 26) was discovered, as\r\nwell as charcoal; a bone bead (Fig. 27), three rude flint flakes, and\r\nthe broken bones of the brown bear, stag, horse, and Celtic shorthorn\r\n(_Bos longifrons_). The harpoon is a little more than three inches\r\nlong, with the head armed with two barbs on each side, and the base\r\npresenting a mode of securing attachment to the handle which has not\r\nbefore been discovered in Britain. Instead of a mere projection to\r\ncatch the ligatures by which it was bound to the shaft, there is a\r\nwell-cut barb on either side, pointing in a contrary direction to those\r\nwhich form the head. Ample use for such an instrument would be found in\r\nMalham tarn, some three miles off, and very probably also in that which\r\nformerly existed close by at Attermire, but which has been choked up by\r\npeat, and is now turned into grass-land by drainage. The remains of the\r\nbrown bear consist of numerous hollow bones and teeth, and the shaft\r\nof a femur with its articular ends broken off, has been polished by\r\nfriction against some soft substance, so that its surface has a lustre\r\nlike that of glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Bone-bead (natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, who were the ancient inhabitants of the\r\ncave whose rude implements occur in this lower stratum? From the few\r\nremains which we discovered, they were hunters and fishermen, and the\r\npossessors of domestic oxen, and possibly horses, and in a much lower\r\nstate of civilization than the Brit-Welsh inhabitants who succeeded\r\nthem in the cave after a long interval. There is no proof that they\r\nused a coinage, or that they were acquainted with metal. The conclusion\r\nthat they were neolithic is based on the following evidence:--In 1871\r\nthe Exploration Committee examined a small cave about 200 yards off,\r\nin King’s Scar, and obtained the broken bones of the stag, Celtic\r\nshort-horn (_Bos longifrons_), goat, and horse, a whetstone, and a\r\nrudely chipped scraper, to which, subsequently, Mr. John Birkbeck,\r\njun., made the important addition of part of a human thigh-bone. This\r\nset of remains, the human thigh-bone excepted, agrees with those in the\r\nlower stratum in the Victoria Cave, not merely in the absence of metal,\r\nbut also in affording signs of a comparatively rude civilization;\r\nand we might reasonably expect that the two caves so close to each\r\nother, would have been occupied by the same people at approximately\r\nthe same time. If this be allowed, the thigh-bone may be assigned to\r\none of these earlier inhabitants, the place of habitation being, as\r\nis frequently the case, subsequently used for purposes of burial. The\r\nthigh-bone itself is characterized by the great development of the\r\nmuscular ridge known to anatomists as the _linea aspera_, implying\r\nthe peculiar flatness of shin which is termed by Professor Busk\r\nplatycnemism. This peculiar form has been met with in the neolithic\r\ntumuli of Yorkshire, explored by the Rev. Canon Greenwell, as well as\r\nin the human remains which I have discovered in the neolithic caves and\r\nchambered tombs of Denbighshire; and since it has not been observed\r\nin any human skeletons in this country which are not of that age, it\r\nmay be fairly taken to prove that a neolithic people formerly lived in\r\nRibblesdale. And further, since the traces of rude culture met with\r\nin these two caves are the same as those which characterize neolithic\r\nburial and dwelling places throughout Europe, they may be assigned to\r\nthat remote age. Similar human remains were obtained by Mr. Farrer from\r\nthe Dowker-bottom Cave, and imply that that cave also was used as a\r\nneolithic burial-place.\r\n\r\nThe identification of this race with the Basque or Iberian stock, from\r\nwhich are descended the small, dark peoples of Derbyshire, Wales, and\r\ncertain parts of Ireland, must be referred to the chapters on the\r\nNeolithic Caves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Stone Adze: _a_, side view; _b_, edge (natural\r\nsize).]\r\n\r\nThe reputed discovery of an adze (Fig. 28), of a variety of greenstone\r\nwhich Mr. Wyndham identifies with melaphyr, many years ago in the\r\nVictoria Cave, may offer additional evidence as to its having been\r\noccupied by a neolithic tribe. It was presented to the Museum of the\r\nPhilosophical Society at Leeds by Mr. Jackson, and figured by Mr. Denny\r\namong the remains from the Caves of Craven, and presents characters\r\nthat have not, to my knowledge, been met with in any other neolithic\r\nimplement found in Great Britain: one end being roughly chipped for\r\ninsertion into a socket, while the other is carefully ground into a\r\nchisel edge. In these respects, as Mr. O’Callaghan and Mr. Denny have\r\nobserved, it bears a striking resemblance to the stone adzes used by\r\nthe South Sea Islanders, and especially in Tahiti;--a resemblance\r\nso strong that, unless it had been traced from the hands of the\r\ndiscoverer into the Museum at Leeds, it would be considered by many\r\narchæologists as an implement actually obtained from the South Seas.\r\nIt may have been derived from the lower stratum, which furnished the\r\nequally peculiar harpoon, Fig. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Approximate Date of the Neolithic Occupation._\r\n\r\nFrom the position in which these remains occurred, it is obvious that\r\na neolithic tribe occupied the cave before the accumulation of the\r\nangular fragments, six feet in thickness (Fig. 20, No. 3; Fig. 21, No.\r\n3), just as the date of the Brit-Welsh occupation is fixed as being\r\nafter this, and before the accumulation of the two feet of débris\r\nabove (No. 5). And in this we have a means of roughly estimating the\r\ninterval of time between them. It is clear that the accumulation of\r\ntwo feet of angular fragments, torn away by the action of the weather\r\nfrom the cliff, has been formed in about 1,200 years, _i.e._ between\r\nthe Brit-Welsh occupation and the present time. If it be admitted that\r\nequal quantities of the cliff have been weathered away in equal times,\r\nit will follow that the thickness of six feet between the Brit-Welsh\r\nstratum and that under examination was formed during a time thrice as\r\nlong, or 3,600 years; and that consequently the date of the earlier\r\noccupation of the cave by man is fixed as being about 4,800, or 5,000\r\nyears ago. It is perfectly true, that in ancient times the frosts\r\nmay have been more intense than they are now, and therefore that\r\nthe rate of weathering may have been faster. To the objection that\r\npossibly a large mass of cliff may have tumbled down at one time, and\r\nsubsequently been disintegrated, it may be answered, that at the point\r\nat the entrance where the section was taken there was no evidence of\r\nany such fall; the angular blocks, both above and below the Brit-Welsh\r\nstratum, being as nearly as possible of the same size, and not lying\r\nwith their faces parallel to each other, as would have been the case\r\nhad they been disintegrated fallen blocks. Nevertheless this attempt\r\nto fix a date cannot lay claim to scientific precision, and in that\r\nrespect is neither better, nor worse, than any other similar attempt\r\nfounded on the rate at which a valley is being excavated, or alluvium\r\nbeing deposited, or on the retrocession of a waterfall, such, for\r\nexample, as Niagara. It is merely valuable as enabling us to form some\r\nsort of idea of the high antiquity of the neolithic men who left these\r\nremains behind in the cave.\r\n\r\nAs the trench (see Figs. 20, 21) begun on the outside passed into the\r\nentrance of the cave, the accumulation of stones above the neolithic\r\nstratum disappeared, and the latter became intermingled with the\r\nBrit-Welsh layer above, so that it would have been impossible to\r\ndistinguish the one from the other had not the talus marked the\r\ninterval in the plateau outside. The talus also above the Brit-Welsh\r\nstratum ceased at the entrance, although here and there large blocks\r\nof stone, fallen from time to time from the roof, rested on its upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grey Clays._\r\n\r\nImmediately below the neolithic stratum, a deposit of stiff grey clay\r\nof unknown depth occupies both the entrance and the inside of the cave\r\n(Figs. 20, 21), containing fragments of limestone and large angular\r\nblocks which had fallen from the roof. A shaft sunk to a depth of\r\ntwenty-five feet near the entrance failed to arrive at the bottom, but\r\npresented the following section in descending order: stiff grey clay\r\nwith layer of stalagmite six feet thick; a finely laminated calcareous\r\nclay twelve feet thick; and below, a similar bed of clay to that on the\r\nsurface. In a second shaft sunk to the depth of twelve feet farther\r\nwithin the cave, the base of the grey clay was not reached.[72]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Section below Grey Clay at entrance.]\r\n\r\nA third shaft, at the entrance, however, penetrated the clay, No.\r\n1 of Figs. 20, 21, 29, at a depth of about five feet, and revealed\r\nthe existence below of a reddish-grey loamy cave-earth (Fig. 29, A),\r\ncontaining bones and teeth of the same animals as those from the\r\ncaverns of Kent’s Hole, Wookey Hole, and others, which belonged to a\r\ngroup that invaded Europe before the glacial period, and that inhabited\r\nthe region north of the Alps and the Pyrenees in pre- and post-glacial\r\ntimes.[73]\r\n\r\nWe subsequently discovered the cave-earth to be from three to four feet\r\nthick, and that it rested on an accumulation (Fig. 29, B) of large\r\nblocks of limestone, the interstices between which were filled with\r\nclay, sometimes laminated and at others homogeneous, as well as with\r\ncoarse sand. Below this we broke into an empty passage, one side of\r\nwhich was formed by the solid rock, and the other of blocks of stone\r\nimbedded in the clay.\r\n\r\nAs we opened out a horizontal passage towards the cave-earth, A, from\r\nthe outside, the talus (Fig. 29, C) of angular débris was cut through\r\nfirst, which gradually became more and more clayey in its lower\r\nportions: at one point, D, there were several glaciated blocks, some\r\nimbedded in clay and others perfectly free. It rested obliquely on the\r\nedges of the cave-earth, and passed gradually at the entrance into the\r\nclay occupying the interior of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pleistocene Occupation by Hyænas._\r\n\r\nThe remains of the spelæan variety of the spotted hyæna were very\r\nabundant in the cave-earth, consisting of fragments of skulls, jaws,\r\nand bones, and especially of coprolites, which formed irregular floors,\r\naccumulated during successive occupations of the cave by that animal.\r\nAll the bones were gnawed and scored by teeth, the lower jaws were\r\nwithout the angle and coronoid process (see Fig. 92), and the hollow\r\nbones which contain marrow were broken, while those which were solid\r\nand marrowless were for the most part perfect: and this held good, not\r\nmerely of the remains of the hyæna, but of those of all the animals\r\nwhich constituted their prey. The bones, for example, of the woolly\r\nrhinoceros are represented merely by the hard distal portion of the\r\nshaft of the humerus, and of the solid bones of the ulna and radius,\r\nwhile the only portions of skull are the solid pedestal offered by the\r\nnasal bones on which the front horn was supported, and a few smaller\r\nfragments. The pedestal in question is depicted by the dark shaded\r\nportion of Fig. 30, the outline of the skull and lower jaw being taken\r\nfrom one of Professor Brandt’s plates of the Woolly Rhinoceros found in\r\nSiberia.[74] The teeth which imply the presence of the mammoth (milk\r\nmolars 3 and 4) were those of a young individual, as is very generally\r\nthe case in caves which have been occupied by hyænas. The young would\r\nnaturally be more exposed to the attack of those cowardly beasts of\r\nprey than the adult, armed with its long curved tusks, and defended,\r\nnot merely by its thick skin, but also by the covering of wool and\r\nlong hair which is peculiar to the species. Besides these animals, the\r\nreindeer, red-deer, bison, horse, the brown, grizzly, and great cave\r\nbears, were preyed upon by the hyænas and dragged into the cave. All\r\nthese species were discovered within an area of a few square yards of\r\ncave-earth, which passes into the interior of the cave under the grey\r\nclay. They belong to that well-defined group known as pleistocene,\r\nquaternary, or post-pleiocene, which was proved to have inhabited\r\nYorkshire[75] in ancient times from Dr. Buckland’s discoveries in\r\nKirkdale, and Mr. Denny’s examination of the river-deposit at Leeds, in\r\nwhich the remains of the hippopotamus were obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Skull of Woolly Rhinoceros, showing the part\r\nwhich is not eaten by the hyænas.]\r\n\r\nThe last and most important addition to this fauna is that of man, a\r\nfragment of fibula in the same mineral condition as the rest of the\r\npleistocene bones, having been identified by Professor Busk with an\r\nunusually massive recent human fibula. Although the fragment is very\r\nsmall, its comparison with the abnormal specimen in Professor Busk’s\r\npossession removes all doubt from my mind, as to its having belonged\r\nto a man, who was contemporary with the cave-hyæna and the other\r\npleistocene animals found in the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The probable Pre-glacial Age of the Pleistocene Stratum._\r\n\r\nIs this occupation of the Victoria Cave by the pleistocene mammalia\r\npre-glacial or post-glacial?--before, or after, the great lowering\r\nof the temperature in northern Europe? This difficult question can\r\nonly be answered by an appeal to the physical history of the clay and\r\ncave-loam, and to the evidence as to glacial action in the district,\r\nand to the distribution of the mammalia in Great Britain during the\r\npleistocene period. Glaciers have left their marks in nearly every\r\npart of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and especially in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Victoria Cave. The hill-sides around are studded with large\r\nice-borne Silurian rocks; boulder-clay occupies nearly every hollow on\r\nthe elevated plateaux; and moraines are to be observed in nearly every\r\nvalley. At the entrance of the cave itself, ice-scratched Silurian\r\ngrit-stones are imbedded in the clay, which abuts directly on the\r\ncave-loam, and passes insensibly into the clay, with angular blocks of\r\nlimestone within the cave. They may possibly be the constituents of a\r\nlateral moraine _in situ_, as Mr. Tiddeman suggests, or they may merely\r\nbe derived from the waste of boulder-clay which has dropped from a\r\nhigher level.\r\n\r\nThe latter view seems to me to be most likely to be true, because some\r\nof the boulders have been deprived of the clay in which they were\r\nimbedded, and are piled on each other with empty space between them,\r\nthe clay being carried down to a lower level and re-deposited. Their\r\nposition, however, on the edges of the cave-earth implies, in any case,\r\nthat they had been dropped after its accumulation.\r\n\r\nThere is another point to be considered in the physical evidence. The\r\ndeposits above the cave-earth, occupying the interior and entrance\r\nof the cave, have been introduced by the rains, either through the\r\nentrance, or through the crevices which penetrate the roof, and consist\r\nof a finer detritus washed out of the boulder-clay on the surface at a\r\nhigher level. The cave-earth, however, although it has been introduced\r\nin the same way, cannot be accounted for on the supposition that it was\r\nderived from the boulder-clay, with which it contrasts in the fact that\r\nit is a loam, of a reddish grey colour, containing a large percentage\r\nof carbonate and phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\nSimilar deposits, characterized by their red colour, are to be found\r\nin nearly all the caves of the south of England, in France, and\r\nsouthern Europe, not complicated, as here, by the glacial phenomena\r\nof the district. Had the layer been formed in the Victoria Cave, from\r\nthe destruction of the boulder-clay, it would have been identical in\r\ncomposition with the deposits above.\r\n\r\nThe laminated portions of the grey clay are considered by Mr. Tiddeman\r\nto have been formed by the flow of water through the entrance, derived\r\nfrom the daily melting of the glacier which occupied the valley in\r\nancient times, and he compares it with a similar lamination in the\r\nboulder-clay at Ingleton, which has been described by Mr. Binney in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Clifton, near Manchester, under the expressive\r\nname of “book-leaves.” Since, however, similar accumulations are being\r\nformed at the present time at the bottom of pools in many caves, as,\r\nfor example, in that of Ingleborough, they cannot be taken to imply a\r\nglacial origin. They are not found merely in one spot in the Victoria\r\nCave, but are scattered, more or less, through the general mass of\r\nthe clay, and occur abundantly even below the cave-earth, having been\r\ndeposited in the interstices between the large blocks of limestone.\r\nIn these positions they are of uncertain age, and there is no reason\r\nwhy some of the hollows which we discovered below the cave-earth (Fig.\r\n29, B) should not be filled with them at the present time by the heavy\r\nrains. They dip at all angles, and are conformable to the surfaces on\r\nwhich they have been dropped.\r\n\r\nThe most important argument in favour of the pre-glacial age of the\r\nmammaliferous cave-earth is afforded by the range of the animals in\r\nGreat Britain during the time that certain areas were occupied by\r\nglaciers. In a paper read before the Geological Society in 1869, I\r\nshowed that those areas in Great Britain in which the marks of glaciers\r\nwere the freshest and most abundant coincided with those which were\r\nbarren of the remains of the pleistocene mammalia, and I therefore\r\ninferred that this was due to the fact, that the areas in question were\r\ncovered by ice at the time that pleistocene animals were so numerous in\r\nthe caves, and river-deposits of southern and eastern England, and on\r\nthe continent. In a map published in 1871, Cumberland, Westmoreland,\r\nLancashire, and the greater portion of Yorkshire are represented as\r\nbeing one of these barren areas, in which no pleistocene mammalia\r\nhave been observed. It is obvious that the hyænas, bears, mammoths,\r\nand other creatures found in the pleistocene stratum, could not have\r\noccupied the district when it was covered by ice; and had they lived\r\nsoon after the retreat of the ice-sheet, their remains would occur in\r\nthe river-gravels, from which they are absent throughout a large area\r\nto the north of a line drawn between Chester and York, whilst they\r\noccur abundantly in the glacial river deposits south of that line. On\r\nthe other hand, they belong to a fauna, that overran Europe, and must\r\nhave occupied this very region before the glacial period, since their\r\nremains have been found in pre-glacial strata to the north in Scotland,\r\nto the south at Selsea, and to the east in Norfolk and Suffolk. It\r\nmay, therefore, reasonably be concluded that they occupied the cave\r\nin pre-glacial times, and that the stratum in which their remains\r\nlie buried, was protected from the grinding of the ice-sheet, which\r\ndestroyed nearly all the surface accumulations in the river-valleys, by\r\nthe walls and roof of rock, which has since, to a great extent, been\r\nweathered away.[76] This view is also held by Mr. Tiddeman.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of the Victoria Cave, which has hitherto yielded such\r\ninteresting evidence of three distinct occupations--first by hyænas,\r\nthen by neolithic men, and lastly by the Brit-Welsh, is by no means\r\ncomplete. The cave itself is of unknown depth and extent, and the mere\r\nremoval of so much earth and clay as it is at present known to contain\r\nwill be a labour of years. The results of the exploration, up to the\r\npresent time, are of almost equal value to the archæologist, to the\r\nhistorian, and the geologist, and prove how close is the bond of union\r\nbetween three branches of human thought which at first sight appear\r\nremote from each other. The discussion of the problems connected with\r\nthe neolithic and pleistocene strata must be referred to the fifth and\r\nfollowing chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kirkhead Cave._\r\n\r\nOther caves in this country, besides the group under consideration in\r\nYorkshire, have been occupied by the Brit-Welsh. That known as the\r\nKirkhead Cave, on the eastern shore of the Promontory of Cartmell, on\r\nthe northern shore of Morecambe Bay, explored by Mr. J. P. Morris,[77]\r\nand a Committee of the Anthropological Society in 1864-5, contained\r\nremains of the same type as those of the Brit-Welsh stratum in the\r\nVictoria Cave. In the débris which formed the floor and extended to\r\nan unknown depth below, a coin of Domitian, “a trefoil-shaped Roman\r\nfibula,” a pin, ornamented with green enamel, and a bronze ring were\r\ndiscovered in association with broken remains of domestic animals--_Bos\r\nlongifrons_, pig and goat, dog and horse, as well as stag, roe, wild\r\ngoose, and many human bones. A bronze celt and a spear-head were also\r\nfound, at a depth respectively of five and six feet, and a flint flake\r\nat a depth of seven feet; and fragments of pottery, a bead of amber,\r\ncut bones, the perforated head of the femur, and other articles. From\r\nthis group of remains it may be inferred that the cave was occupied by\r\nthe Brit-Welsh, and before them by the users of bronze, and possibly by\r\na neolithic people, and that it had at some time or another been used\r\nas a place of burial. Just inside the entrance, which overlooked the\r\nsea at a height of 45 feet, a semi-circular breastwork of large stones\r\nrendered the cave habitable, and capable of easy defence.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris’s view that the discovery of a bronze celt, flint flakes,\r\nand coins in this cave proves that all three were in use at the same\r\ntime, and by the same people, is not borne out by the published account\r\nof the excavation. There is no proof that the deposit had not been\r\ndisturbed, or that the articles were not dropped at different times.\r\nAnd in support of this conclusion, it may be advanced, that there is\r\nno case on record of the discovery of bronze celts or swords along\r\nwith any Roman coins under conditions which would prove that they were\r\nin use at the same time. Had such been the case the ruins of the many\r\nRoman villas and cities, destroyed by the English, would have furnished\r\nsome examples. At Silchester, even such a rare article as a Roman eagle\r\nhas been met with. There is every reason to believe with Sir John\r\nLubbock, Mr. Evans, and other eminent archæologists, that the use of\r\nbronze for weapons had been superseded by that of iron before the dawn\r\nof history in this country. It is otherwise with the flint flakes;\r\nsince my discovery of several inside a Roman coffin at Hardham, near\r\nPulborough, in Sussex, in a cemetery that belongs to the later portion\r\nof the Roman dominion in Britain, proves that they were used for some\r\npurpose at that time.[78]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poole’s Cave, near Buxton._\r\n\r\nIn the collection of articles obtained from Poole’s Cave, in Buxton,\r\nin Derbyshire, I identified, in 1871, in company with Mr. Pennington,\r\nbronze Roman coins, minimi, Samian and other ware, and large quantities\r\nof broken bones of the same animals as those from the Victoria Cave. A\r\nbronze harp-shaped fibula of the type of Fig. 5 of the coloured Plate\r\nis inlaid with silver, and is so perfect that it might still be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thor’s Cave, near Ashbourne._\r\n\r\nA cave also, in Staffordshire, four miles from Ilam, explored by the\r\nMidland Scientific Association in 1864,[79] under the supervision of\r\nMr. Carrington, has furnished articles of the same kind as those of\r\nYorkshire. It is known as Thor’s cave, and penetrates the lofty cliff\r\nof limestone, on the south side of the river Manifold, at a height of\r\nabout 254 feet from the bottom of the valley, and about 900 feet above\r\nthe sea, running horizontally inwards, and being divided inside by a\r\nrow of buttressed columns into two noble gothic aisles. Its bottom was\r\noccupied by clay, in which, near the entrance, there were thick layers\r\nof charcoal at depths of two, three, and four feet below the surface,\r\nmingled with broken bones and pottery, that indicated the spots where\r\nfires had been kindled. The articles discovered were as follows:--\r\n\r\n“_Bronze._--Armlet, two fibulæ of harp pattern (see coloured Plate,\r\nFig. 5), two plain breast-pins and rings, a curious wheel-shaped\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n“_Iron._--Large triangular fork, arrow-heads, lance-heads, several\r\nknives and a chopper, of singular shapes, reaping hook (?), adze, pins,\r\ntwo girdle hooks (?), &c.\r\n\r\n“_Bone._--Seven snags of deer’s horns, variously cut and perforated,\r\nseveral others not perforated, curious bone comb ornamented with\r\ncircles, flat bone perforated with four holes, two leg-bones carved\r\nat the ends, pin, a large quantity of bones of animals that had been\r\nconsumed for food.\r\n\r\n“_Stone._--Greenstone pounder, fragments of querns, perforated disk, &c.\r\n\r\n“_Pottery._--A large collection of fragments of various periods, among\r\nthe rest several pieces of true Samian ware.”\r\n\r\nMr. Edwin Brown, from whose report this list is taken, concludes that\r\nThor’s cave was occupied during “the late Celtic and Romano-Celtic\r\nperiods.” The harp-fibulæ are of a pattern identical with several of\r\nthose discovered in the Victoria Cave, and the holes at their upper\r\nends were probably intended for the reception of enamel. The bronze\r\ninstrument, consisting of a disk cut out into a flamboyant pattern\r\nlike that of the round brooch from the Victoria Cave (Fig. 25), and\r\njoined to a central stem ornamented with waved lines, was intended for\r\nsuspension; possibly, as Mr. Carrington suggests, it may have been\r\nused for spinning. It is a remarkably fine example of Brit-Welsh or\r\nlate Celtic art. The bone comb is of the same type as those from the\r\nBrit-Welsh caves of Yorkshire. It is evident, from Mr. Brown’s account,\r\nthat there were distinct layers of occupation; but, unfortunately, the\r\narticles found in each were not separated from the rest. One armlet\r\n(Fig. 31), composed of a thin plate of bronze, and ornamented with a\r\ndotted-line pattern, is of the peculiar type which is characteristic of\r\nthe bronze age.\r\n\r\nThe cave had also been used as a place of sepulture, for near “the\r\npulpit rock,” and at a depth of five feet from the surface, a skeleton\r\nrested in the sitting posture which is so characteristic of neolithic\r\ninterments in Europe. It had also been entered by man even before any\r\nof these accumulations. “In the south recess, behind and below any\r\ntraces of man’s occupation, the diggers came upon a kind of flooring\r\nof tabular masses of breccia stretching almost across the cave, and on\r\none side attached firmly to the wall,” beneath which rested, in the\r\nundisturbed clay, a deer’s horn, rudely sawn across and perforated by\r\ntwo holes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Bronze Bracelet from Thor’s Cave.]\r\n\r\nThor’s Cave, therefore, like the Victoria, has been occupied by man in\r\nthe Brit-Welsh stage of the historic period, as well as in the bronze,\r\nand possibly in the neolithic ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historic Value of Brit-Welsh Group of Caves._\r\n\r\nThe discovery that caves were used as habitations by men accustomed\r\nto the elegance of civilized life, not merely in Yorkshire, but in\r\ndistricts so far removed from each other as Staffordshire and the\r\nextreme north of Lancashire, during the fifth and sixth centuries,\r\nimplies the pressure of a far-reaching calamity by which they were\r\ndriven from their homes. It completes and rounds off the story of the\r\nsocial condition of the country during these troubled times, which is\r\nrevealed in the sacked and burned Brit-Welsh cities and villas, as\r\nwell as in the scanty records of the English invasion.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investigation will probably show that caves were occupied\r\nat this time in every part of the country which was conquered by\r\nthe English. In the upper stratum of Kent’s Hole, for example, near\r\nTorquay, similar articles, with the exception of the enamels, have been\r\ndiscovered. There, however, the occupation may have been considerably\r\nlater than in the caves of Yorkshire, because the Roman civilization\r\nwas not supplanted in Devonshire by the English until the beginning of\r\nthe ninth century. The river Tamar then marked the frontier between\r\nthe English, and the Brit-Welsh of the promontory of Cornwall, which\r\nrepresented the dominion of West Wales in the days of Ecgberht.[80]\r\n\r\nIn the numerous caves of Wales, on the other hand, which I have\r\nexplored, there is no trace of inhabitants of the fifth and sixth\r\ncenturies, a circumstance that is easily accounted for by the fact\r\nthat Wales was not invaded at that time by the English. There would\r\ntherefore be no reason for the civilized Brit-Welsh to fly to caves for\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principal Animals and Articles in Brit-Welsh Caves._\r\n\r\nThe following are the more important animals and articles found in the\r\ngroup of caves under consideration. The species are identical with\r\nthose which I have tabulated from refuse-heaps of Roman age.[81]\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Principal Animals and Objects found in Brit-Welsh Strata in\r\nCaves._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+--------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+\r\n  |          ANIMALS.       |Victoria|Kelko|Dowker |Kirk |Poole’s|Thor’s|\r\n  |                         |        |     |Bottom.|head.|Cavern.|Cave. |\r\n  +-------------------------+--------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |         DOMESTIC.       |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Canis familiaris_--Dog  |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Sus scrofa_--Pig        |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Equus caballus_--Horse  |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Bos longifrons_--Celtic |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |  Short-horn             |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Capra hircus_--Goat     |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |           WILD.         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Canis vulpes_--Fox      |    X   | ... |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Meles taxus_--Badger    |    X   | ... |   X   |...  |  ...  |  x   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Cervus elaphus_--Stag   |    X   | ... |   X   |  X  |   X   |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |_Cervus capreolus_--Roe  |    X   | ... |   X   |  X  |  ...  |  ?   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Roman coins or imitations|    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |   X   |  X   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Enamelled ornaments in   |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |  bronze                 |    X   |  X  |   X   |  X  |  ...  | ...  |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Bronze ornaments inlaid  |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |  with silver            |    X   |  X  |   X   | ... |   X   | ...  |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Iron articles            |    X   |  X  |   X   | ... |   X   |  X   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Samian ware              |    X   | ... |   X   | ... |   X   |  X   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Black ware               |    X   |  X  |   X   | ... |   X   |  X   |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Bone-spoon fibulæ        |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |  (Fig. 22)              |    X   |  X  |   X   | ... |  ...  | ...  |\r\n  |                         |        |     |       |     |       |      |\r\n  |Bone combs               |    X   |  X  |   X   | ... |  ...  |  X   |\r\n  +-------------------------+--------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+\r\n\r\nAll the less important animals and articles are omitted from this list.\r\nIt will be observed that the brown bear, the wolf, and the fallow-deer\r\nare absent. The brown bear was probably at this time very rare in\r\nBritain, since its remains have been met with in but two out of the\r\nmany Roman refuse-heaps in the country, at London and Colchester. The\r\nwell-known lines of Martial, however, imply that it was imported from\r\nBritain to Rome at this time--\r\n\r\n    “Nuda Caledonio sic pectora præbuit urso,\r\n    Haud falsa pendens in cruce Laureolus.”\r\n\r\nIt probably became extinct about the ninth or tenth century. The wolf\r\nobviously would not be likely to be used for food, although it probably\r\nwas abundant in the district. The fallow-deer also had not penetrated\r\ninto the hilly districts, although it had become naturalized in this\r\ncountry by the Romans, so as to have been frequently used as an article\r\nof food before the English invasion. I have seen its characteristic\r\nantlers in refuse-heaps, both in London and Colchester, which have\r\nfurnished Roman coins and pottery.\r\n\r\nThe beaver was probably very rare in the fifth and sixth centuries, and\r\nhas been met with in no cave-deposit, either historic or prehistoric,\r\nin this country. It was, however, known to the Anglian conquerors of\r\nYorkshire (Northumbria), who called Beverley (lea, leag-) after its\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Use of Horseflesh._\r\n\r\nThe broken bones of the horse, in all the caves above mentioned,\r\nleave no room to doubt that horseflesh was a common article of food\r\nat that time. It was so, indeed, throughout Roman Britain, and after\r\nthe English invasion was used as late as the Council of Celchyth,[82]\r\nin the year 787. It was forbidden by the Church because it was eaten\r\nby the Scandinavian peoples in honour of Odin. In Norway,[83] Hacon,\r\nthe foster-son of Æthelstan, was compelled to eat it by the bonders,\r\nin 956, and the revolt of the bonders which ended in the bloody battle\r\nof Stikklestadt, in which Olaf met his death, in 1030, was caused by\r\nhis cruelties to the eaters of horseflesh. As Christianity prevailed\r\nover the worship of Thor and Odin, it was banished from the table.\r\nThe present prejudice against its use is a remarkable instance of the\r\nchange in taste, which has been brought about by an ecclesiastical\r\nrule aimed against a long-forgotten faith. The rule was not, however,\r\nalways obeyed, for the Monks of St. Gall, in the eleventh century, not\r\nonly ate horseflesh, but returned thanks for it, in a metrical grace,\r\nwritten by Ekkehard the Younger (died 1036):--\r\n\r\n    “Sit feralis equi caro dulcis sub cruce Christi.”[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Longberry Bank._\r\n\r\nThe cave of Longberry Bank, near Penally, in Pembrokeshire, may also\r\nbe classed with those which were inhabited in historic times, since\r\nit contained red fine-grained pottery of a kind commonly found in the\r\nruins of Roman villas. It was explored by the Rev. H. H. Winwood, in\r\n1866, in whose collection are the remains of the _Bos longifrons_,\r\ngoat, badger, dog, as well as shells of oyster, large limpets and\r\nmussel from the neighbouring shore. Some of the bones are burned.\r\nSeveral human vertebræ and a metacarpal were probably the traces of an\r\ninterment of unknown date; and the two flint flakes are of uncertain\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by the exploration of the caves described in this\r\nchapter are to be taken merely as the first-fruits of a new line of\r\ninquiry, which is likely to throw light on many points relating to art,\r\nhistory, and the range of the animals, and not as being perfect or\r\nfinal. On the continent, no historic caves of importance have as yet\r\nbeen explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCAVES USED IN THE AGES OF IRON AND OF BRONZE.\r\n\r\n  The Difference between Historic and Prehistoric Time.--The\r\n    Prehistoric Fauna.--The Archæological Classification.--Caves of\r\n    the Iron Age.--Caves of the Bronze Age in Britain.--The Caves\r\n    of Césareda in Portugal probably occupied by Cannibals.--The Cave\r\n    of Reggio in Apulia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Difference between Historic and Prehistoric Time._\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary before we examine the group of caves used by man\r\nin prehistoric times, to point out the important difference in the\r\nmeasurement of time within and beyond the borders of history. When we\r\nspeak, for example, of the date of the Norman Conquest, we imply that\r\nwe can ascertain by historical records, not merely that it succeeded\r\nthe invasion of Britain by the English or Danes, and happened before\r\nour own time, but that the interval which separates it from those\r\nevents can be accurately measured by the unit of years. If, however,\r\nwe attempt to ascertain the date of any event which happened outside\r\nthe historical limit, we shall find that it is a question solely\r\nof relation. When we speak, for example, of the neolithic age, we\r\nmerely mean a certain stage of human progress which succeeded the\r\npalæolithic, and preceded the bronze age, but we have no proof of\r\nthe length of the interval dividing it from the one or the other. The\r\nhistoric “when?” implies “how long ago?” the prehistoric “when?” merely\r\nimplies a definition before and after certain events, without any idea\r\nof the measurement of the intervals.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to ascertain the absolute date of prehistoric events must\r\nof necessity fail, since it is based on the improbable assumption\r\nthat the physical agents have acted uniformly, and that therefore the\r\nresults may be used as a natural chronometer. The present rate of the\r\naccumulation of _débris_, as at the Victoria Cave of the preceding\r\nchapter, or of that of silt in the deltas of rivers, such as the Nile,\r\nor the Tinière, may convey a rough idea of the high antiquity of\r\nprehistoric deposits; but a slight change either of the climate, or of\r\nthe rainfall, would invalidate the conclusion. When the greater part\r\nof Europe lay buried under forest, when Palestine supported a large\r\npopulation, and when glaciers crowned some of the higher mountains of\r\nAfrica, such as the Atlas, the European and Egyptian climates were\r\nprobably moister than at the present time, and the rainfall and the\r\nfloods greater, and consequently the accumulation of sediment quicker\r\nthan the observed rate under the present conditions. And in the same\r\nway all estimates of the lapse of past time, based upon the excavation\r\nof a river valley, or the retrocession of a waterfall, such as Niagara,\r\nlie open to the same kind of objection. It is not at all reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the complex conditions which regulate the present rate of\r\nerosion, have been the same during the time the work has been done,\r\nand it therefore follows that the work done is a measure of the power\r\nemployed, and not of the length of time during which it has been in\r\noperation. We must, therefore, give up the idea of measuring the past\r\nbeyond the memory of man, as represented in historical documents, by\r\nthe historic unit of years. We can merely trace a definite sequence of\r\nevents, separated one from another by uncertain intervals. And for that\r\nseries of events which extends from the borders of history back to the\r\nremote age where the geologist, descending the stream of time, meets\r\nthe archæologist, I have adopted the term prehistoric.[85]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Prehistoric Fauna._\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric period is characterized by the arrival of the domestic\r\nanimals in Europe, under the care of man. The dog, swine, horse,\r\nhorned-sheep, goat, _Bos longifrons_, and the larger ox descended from\r\nan ancestor, according to Professor Rütimeyer, of the type of the great\r\nUrus, make their appearance together, in association with the remains\r\nof man, in the neolithic stage of civilization.[86] Subsequently they\r\nspread over the whole of our continent, for the most part under the\r\ncare of man. The _Bos longifrons_, however, and possibly also the\r\nUrus, reverted to feral conditions, just as the horses and oxen, in\r\nthe Americas and Australia, have done at the present time, and their\r\nremains are therefore frequently found in association with animals\r\nundoubtedly wild. The domestic horse, the variety of hog descended\r\nfrom the wild boar, and the domestic cattle derived from the Urus, may\r\npossibly have passed under the yoke of man, in Europe, since their\r\nwild stocks were to be found in that area, both in the prehistoric\r\nand pleistocene times. This, however, cannot be affirmed of the swine\r\ndescended from the southern variety of _Sus Indica_, or of the Celtic\r\nshorthorn, of the sheep, or goat, since their wild ancestors were not\r\nindigenous in Europe. These animals must have been domesticated in\r\nsome area outside Europe; and since central Asia is the region where\r\nthe wild stocks still exist, from which all the domestic animals are\r\ndescended, it is reasonable to suppose that they were domesticated\r\nin that region, and thence introduced, by a race of shepherds and\r\nherdsmen, into our quarter of the world.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is considerably strengthened by the evidence which\r\nProfessor Heer has advanced, as to the vegetables used by the dwellers\r\non piles in the Swiss lakes, among which some, such as the two kinds of\r\nmillet, the six-rowed barley (hordeum hexastichon), the Egyptian wheat\r\n(triticum turgidum), and a weed (Silene cretica), accidentally brought\r\nalong with them, are distinctively of southern derivation.\r\n\r\nThe most important wild animals living in this country during the\r\nprehistoric period are the urus, the gigantic skulls of which occur\r\nin the peat bogs of England and Scotland, the Irish elk, the moose\r\n(_Cervus alces_), and the reindeer. The two last are far more abundant\r\nin the north than in the south of Britain; their remains have been\r\ndiscovered in the neighbourhood of London, those of both animals at\r\nWalthamstow, and those of the latter at Crossness in Kent, on the banks\r\nof the Thames. The remains of the bison have not been recorded from any\r\nprehistoric deposit in this country.\r\n\r\nThe Irish elk is the only animal which has become extinct; while the\r\nmoose, or true elk, is the only wild species which has not been proved\r\nto have been living in the preceding age. The stag was very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric fauna is distinguished from that of the pleistocene\r\nnot merely by the appearance of the animals above mentioned, which\r\nwere hitherto unknown, but by the absence of many species which were\r\nliving during the latter period. The cave bear, woolly rhinoceros, and\r\nmammoth, for example, became extinct, the musk-sheep and lemming were\r\nbanished from a temperate latitude to take refuge in the regions of the\r\nnorth, while the spotted hyæna, the hippopotamus, and Felis caffer,\r\nretired to the warm regions of Africa, where they are still living.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Archæological Classification._\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric period has been classified by the archæologists\r\naccording to the stages of human progress which it presents. At the\r\nfrontier of history, in each country, we find that the dwellers\r\nwere acquainted with the use of iron, and had found it to be the\r\nmost convenient material for the manufacture of cutting weapons and\r\nimplements. Before this the voice of tradition points out that bronze\r\nwas the only material used for these purposes, and stone before bronze.\r\nThese three stages of human culture, or the ages of iron, bronze, and\r\nstone, have been fully verified by investigations which have been\r\nmade in various parts of Europe, into the prehistoric habitations and\r\nburial-places of man.\r\n\r\nThis classification by no means implies an exact chronology, or that\r\nany one of these ages, with the exception perhaps of the first, covered\r\nthe whole of Europe at the same point of time, but that the order in\r\nwhich they followed each other is the same in each country which has\r\nbeen explored. There is good reason for the belief, that at the time\r\nthe Egyptian and Assyrian empires were in the height of their glory,\r\nNorthern Europe was inhabited by rude polished-stone-using races. And\r\nit is a well-ascertained fact, that while the inhabitants of Britain\r\nand Scandinavia were in their bronze age, the Etruscans and Phœnicians\r\nwere in their full power in the south. It is obvious again, that, even\r\nin the same country, the poorer classes must have been long content\r\nto use the ruder and more common materials for their daily needs,\r\nwhile the richer and more powerful used the rarer and more costly.\r\nThese three ages must therefore necessarily overlap. “Like the three\r\nprincipal colours of the rainbow,” writes Mr. Evans,[87] “these three\r\nstages of civilization overlap, intermingle, and shade off the one\r\ninto the other; and yet their succession, as far as Western Europe\r\nis concerned, appears to be equally well defined with that of the\r\nprismatic colours, though the proportions of the spectrum may vary in\r\ndifferent countries.” They cannot reasonably be viewed as hard and fast\r\nlines of division, mapping off successive quantities of time.\r\n\r\nThe age of stone is subdivided by Sir John Lubbock into the neolithic\r\nperiods, or that in which polished stone was the only material used\r\nfor cutting, and the palæolithic, in which mankind had not learnt to\r\ngrind and polish his implements. The latter belongs to the pleistocene,\r\nor quaternary period, since the palæolithic implements are found in\r\nassociation with the remains of the animals characteristic of that age.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric caves, therefore, may be divided into three classes\r\nif the archæological method of analysis be employed: 1, into those\r\ncontaining evidence of the use of iron; 2, those containing proof\r\nof the knowledge of bronze; 3, and lastly, those in which traces of\r\npolished stone weapons have been discovered unassociated with metals.\r\nBy the animal remains which they contain they may be distinguished\r\nfrom those of the pleistocene age, both by the absence, as well as the\r\npresence of certain species which have been enumerated.\r\n\r\nFrom the archæological point of view, two out of the four ages are\r\nstill represented. Stone is, at the present time, the only material\r\nused in the more remote regions of Australia, although it is fast being\r\nreplaced by iron, which has superseded bronze, and is spreading rapidly\r\nover the whole earth. The group of historic caves described in the\r\npreceding chapter may be said to belong to the iron age, that is to\r\nsay, to that later portion of it in which the events are recorded in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe traces of the occupation of caves by man in the iron and bronze\r\nages are so extremely scarce, that it is certain that they were\r\nbut rarely used as habitations. Man had sufficiently advanced in\r\ncivilization in those times to construct artificial dwellings and tombs\r\nfor himself, instead of using the natural shelters which were so very\r\ngenerally occupied in Europe by his ruder neolithic predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave of the Iron Age._\r\n\r\nIn the course of the systematic exploration of caves in the Mendip\r\nHills, carried on by Messrs. Ayshford Sanford, Parker, and myself, a\r\ncave was examined in Burrington Combe, near Wrington, in Somerset,\r\nwhich may be referred to the iron age, and which we named Whitcombe’s\r\nHole. It opened upon the side of that magnificent combe, at a height\r\nof about 135 feet from the bottom and fifteen from the top, and ran\r\nhorizontally inwards, the floor being formed of an accumulation of\r\nearth mingled with charcoal, and containing numerous broken bones\r\nand teeth. The latter belonged to the wolf, fox, badger, rabbit,\r\nhare, stag, goat, and Celtic shorthorn. In the lower portion were the\r\nfragments of a rude, unornamented urn of a coarse black ware, with the\r\nrim turned at right angles, along with a bent piece of iron, which\r\nbears a strong resemblance to those found strengthening the corners of\r\nwooden coffins in the Gallo-Roman graves on the banks of the Somme. The\r\nfractures of the bones, with one exception, were caused by the hand\r\nof man, and not by the teeth of the carnivora. The position renders\r\nthe cave eminently fitted for concealment, for while commanding an\r\nextensive view down the Combe, it is invisible both from above and\r\nbelow, and opening on the face of an almost vertical cliff, it is\r\neasily defended. If the urn be sepulchral, the interment must be of\r\na later date than the occupation, because it is made in the _débris_\r\nwhich resulted from the latter.[88]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of the Bronze Age in Britain._\r\n\r\nThe cave of Heathery Burn,[89] near Stanhope, in Weardale, co. Durham,\r\nis the only one in this country that has furnished a large series of\r\narticles of the bronze age. It is described by Mr. Elliott as running\r\ninto the precipitous side of a ravine, at a height of about 10 to\r\n12 feet above the level of the Stanhope Burn, and as being partially\r\ntraversed by water. Since its discovery in 1861, it has been altogether\r\ndestroyed by the removal of the stone to be used as a flux in smelting\r\nthe ore of the Weardale Iron Company, and an admirable section of its\r\ncontents was therefore visible from time to time. A stratum of sand at\r\nthe bottom, two feet nine inches thick, deposited by the stream, and\r\ncontaining angular masses of limestone that had dropped from the roof,\r\nwas covered by a sheet of stalagmite three inches in thickness. On this\r\nrested a mass of bones and implements imbedded in silt or sand, and\r\nsealed over by a thickness of stalagmite of from two to eight inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Bronze Knife, Heathery Burn (natural size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Bronze Armlet, Heathery Burn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Bronze Spearhead, Heathery Burn (½ size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Bronze Mould for casting a socketed celt.]\r\n\r\nOn removing the upper of these two stalagmitic floors a perfect human\r\nskull was discovered, along with broken bones of animals, charcoal,\r\nlimpet shells, bone pins, an instrument of bone like a paper-knife,\r\ncoarse pottery with fragments of chert imbedded in its mass, a portion\r\nof a jet armlet, as well as several boars’ tusks. The same stratum\r\nat another place furnished a singular bronze knife with a socket for\r\nthe handle (Fig. 32),[90] bronze pins, celts, an armlet of twisted\r\nwire (Fig. 33), along with shells of limpet, mussel, and oyster, and\r\ncharcoal, and at a third, on the other side of the watercourse, a\r\nbronze spear-head. Subsequently, many articles were added to the\r\nabove list, seven pins, three rings, two split-rings, a “razor,” disk,\r\nthree socketed celts, one chisel, two gouges, and four spear-heads of\r\nbronze, and a fine bracelet, and two ornaments of the horse-shoe, or\r\nsplit-ring type, made of thin plates of gold. One of the spear-heads,\r\nin the collection of the Rev. Canon Greenwell, is represented in Fig.\r\n34. There were also waste pieces of bronze, and the half of a bronze\r\nmould for casting celts, Fig. 35, in which one of the associated celts\r\nhad actually been cast, since it is of the same pattern. These articles\r\nwere probably concealed in the cavern by workers in bronze, who were\r\nprevented, by some unforeseen accident, from obtaining them again. The\r\ncharcoal and the broken bones of the _Bos longifrons_, badger, and dog,\r\nimply that the cave had been used as a habitation; and possibly the\r\ntwo human skulls, which have been described by Professor Huxley and\r\nMr. Carter Blake, may have belonged to the possessors of the hoard of\r\nbronze and gold. Both were discovered in the same stratum and below the\r\nfloor of stalagmite.\r\n\r\nThe more perfect of the two skulls is considered by Professor Huxley to\r\nbelong to the same long-headed race of men as that found at Muskham, in\r\nthe valley of the Trent,--to a form which he terms the River-bed type,\r\nand that cannot be separated from those obtained from the long tumuli\r\nof the South of England, and considered by Dr. Thurnam to belong to a\r\nNeolithic Basque, or Iberian population.\r\n\r\nArticles distinctly of the bronze age have been already noticed as\r\nhaving been met with in the caves of Kirkhead, in Cartmell, and in\r\nThor’s Cave, in Staffordshire. From the latter the bracelet of thin\r\nbronze, Fig. 31, was obtained by Mr. Carrington, of Wetton. The rarity\r\nof bronze implements in caves in Britain and the Continent is probably,\r\nto a large extent, due to the value of the material, and to the fact\r\nthat it could be re-melted. If a bronze article happened to be broken,\r\nthe pieces would naturally be kept for future use, and not thrown away,\r\nas in the case of a fractured stone implement. The former, therefore,\r\nare rare, the latter comparatively abundant.\r\n\r\nThe cave called the Cat-Hole, in Gower (Glamorgan), explored by\r\nColonel Wood in 1864, contained several human skeletons, flint flakes,\r\nfragments of red pottery marked with a string, cut bones, a stone\r\nmuller, and a bronze socketed celt. The last is of the same pattern\r\nas some of those in the collection of the Rev. Canon Greenwell, from\r\nHeathery Burn, and has been cast in a mould similar in size and\r\nornamentation to that figured in woodcut 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Césareda probably occupied by Cannibals._\r\n\r\nThe contents of three caves[91] in the Iberian peninsula, referable to\r\nthe dawn of the bronze age, render it very probable that the use of\r\nhuman flesh was not unknown in those times.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Senhor J. L. Delgado described his researches in the caverns\r\nof Césareda, in the valley of the Tagus, in the Casa da Maura, Lapa\r\nFurada, and Cova da Maura. The first of these contained two distinct\r\nstrata. The lower, consisting of sand mixed with fragments of rock,\r\nrested on the stalagmite, and contained fragments of charcoal, one\r\nimplement of bone, and many of flint, a scraper, a flake, and an\r\narrow-head. The broken bones and teeth belonged to the following\r\nanimals:--The lynx, fox, brown-bear, dog and wolf, a species of deer,\r\nthe water-vole, and the rabbit. None of the remains of the carnivora\r\nhad been subjected to the action of fire, or had been used for food. A\r\nhuman skull with lower jaw was dug out of the deepest part, but, since\r\nthe matrix had been disturbed, it had probably been interred after the\r\naccumulation of the deposit.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized by Professor Busk[92] as belonging to the same long\r\ntype as the skulls of the caves of Gibraltar and the Basque graveyard,\r\nmeasuring in length 6·7 inches, in breadth 5·3, in height 5·5, and\r\ntherefore possessing cephalic and latitudinal indices of ·785 and\r\n·820.[93]\r\n\r\nThe upper stratum, a sandy loam, contained a large quantity of stones,\r\nand numerous articles fabricated by man: polished-stone axes, flakes,\r\nand other instruments of flint, bone, and antler, fragments of coarse\r\nblack pottery, with bits of calcareous spar imbedded in its substance,\r\nand two plates of schist ornamented with a rude design, which may have\r\nbeen used as amulets. Fragments of charcoal were scattered throughout\r\nthe matrix, and adhered to some of the pottery and to the burnt\r\npebbles. The most abundant remains were those of man. They were to be\r\ncounted by thousands, and were so fragmentary and scattered that it was\r\nimpossible to put together one perfect skeleton. The teeth, belonging\r\nfor the most part to children or fully-grown adults, were particularly\r\nabundant. The long bones had lost, very generally, their articular\r\nends, had been fractured longitudinally, and some of them had been cut\r\nand scraped. It is therefore probable that this accumulation was formed\r\nby a tribe of cannibals: the evidence that human flesh formed their\r\nprincipal food being precisely of the same nature as that by which the\r\nflint-folk of the Périgord are proved to have subsisted on the flesh of\r\nthe reindeer. Professor Busk,[94] however, is inclined to believe the\r\nfacts in support of cannibalism insufficient. The associated animals\r\nconsisted of the bat, dormouse, rabbit, horse, a small ox, allied to\r\n_Bos longifrons_, sheep or goat, wild cat, wolf, fox, and dog. The\r\ncontents of the other two caves were precisely of the same nature, and\r\nhad been accumulated under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nA bronze arrow-head, discovered in the upper stratum, and the\r\nornamentation of the stone amulet, consisting of alternate triangles\r\nand zigzag ladders, as remarked by Mr. John Evans, indicate that the\r\nupper deposit belongs to the age of bronze, and probably to an early\r\nstage, when stone was being superseded by bronze, since many stone\r\ncelts were found in the same spot.\r\n\r\nThe ancient burial-places of Ultz, in Westphalia, furnish a second\r\ncase of the practice of cannibalism, according to M. Schaaffhausen of\r\nBonn[95]. They are probably of the age of bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Reggio, in Modena._\r\n\r\nThe human remains in a cave in the province of Reggio,[96] on the\r\nnorthern flank of the Apennines, brought before the Prehistoric\r\nCongress at Bologna by M. l’Abbé Chierici, and considered by him to be\r\nproofs of cannibalism, are probably merely the result of interment in a\r\nrefuse-heap that had previously been accumulated. They were associated\r\nwith bronze pins, rivets, polished-stone axes, and various implements\r\nof bone, fragments of pottery and of charcoal, bones of pig, sheep,\r\nand dog, and belong therefore to the period of transition from the\r\nneolithic to the bronze age.\r\n\r\nThe caves have contributed but very little to our knowledge of the\r\nbronze-folk in any part of Europe. Examples, such as those given above,\r\nare scattered through France and Spain, but they are not sufficiently\r\nimportant to require notice. We could not expect that men, in the high\r\nstate of civilization implied by the beautiful jewellery and ornaments\r\nwhich are distinctive of the bronze-folk, would have chosen the wild,\r\nhalf-savage life which is involved in cave-habitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCAVES OF THE NEOLITHIC AGE.\r\n\r\n  Neolithic Caves in Great Britain.--The Refuse-heap at\r\n    Perthi-Chwareu.--The Sepulchral Caves.--The Neolithic Caves in\r\n    the neighbourhood of Cefn, St. Asaph.--The Chambered Tomb near\r\n    Cefn.--Interments in Tomb and Caves of the same age.--Contents\r\n    of Tomb and Caves.--Description of Human Remains by Professor\r\n    Busk--From Cave No. 1 at Perthi-Chwareu--from Cairn at Cefn--from\r\n    Cave at Cefn.--General Conclusions as to Human Remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the scanty remains found in caves, that they were\r\nnot the normal habitations of men in the Bronze or Iron stages of\r\nculture. We shall, however, find that they were used by the neolithic\r\npeoples, both for shelter and for burial, in nearly every portion of\r\nEurope which has been explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Neolithic Caves in Great Britain.--Perthi-Chwareu._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable examples of caves, turned to both these uses, in\r\nBritain, are offered by the group clustering round a refuse-heap at\r\nPerthi-Chwareu, a farm high up in the Welsh hills, about ten miles to\r\nthe east of Corwen, and a mile to the west of the little village of\r\nLlandegla, in Denbighshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Refuse-heap._\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of any prehistoric remains in that locality was\r\nafforded by a small box of bones forwarded to me by Mr. Darwin, in\r\n1869; and this I was able to follow up, through the kind assistance of\r\nMrs. Lloyd, the owner of the property on which they were found, from\r\ntime to time, during 1869-70-71-2. The mountain limestone, which there\r\nforms hill and valley, consists of thick masses of hard rock, separated\r\nby soft beds of shale, and contains large quantities of _producti_,\r\ncrinoids and corals. The strata dip to the south, at an angle of about\r\n1 in 25, and form two parallel ridges, with abrupt faces to the north,\r\nand separated from each other by a narrow valley, passing east and west\r\nalong the strike. The remains sent by Mr. Darwin were obtained from a\r\nspace between two strata near the top of the northern ridge, whence the\r\nintervening softer material had been carried away by water. Its maximum\r\nheight was 6 inches, and its width 20 feet or more; and it extended\r\nin a direction parallel to the bed of the rocks. The bones, which\r\nhad evidently been washed in by the rain, and not carried in by any\r\ncarnivora, belong to the following species:--\r\n\r\n    _Canis familiaris_--The Dog.\r\n    _Canis vulpes_--The Fox.\r\n    _Meles taxus_--The Badger.\r\n    _Sus scrofa_--The Pig.\r\n    _Cervus capreolus_--The Roe-deer.\r\n    _Cervus elaphus_--The Red-deer.\r\n    _Capra hircus_--The Goat.\r\n    _Bos longifrons_--The Celtic Short-horn.\r\n    _Equus caballus_--The Horse.\r\n    _Arvicola amphibius_--The Water-rat.\r\n    _Lepus timidus_--The Hare.\r\n    _Lepus cuniculus_--The Rabbit.\r\n\r\n    The Eagle.\r\n\r\nNearly all the bones were broken, and belonged to young animals. Those\r\nof the Celtic short-horn, of the sheep or goat, and of the young pig,\r\nwere very abundant; while those of the roe and stag, hare and horse,\r\nwere comparatively rare. The remains of the domestic dog were rather\r\nabundant, and the percentage of young puppies implies also that they,\r\nlike the other animals, had been used for food. Possibly the hare may\r\nalso have been eaten, but its remains were scarce, and belonged to\r\nadults. Some of the bones had been gnawed by dogs. The only reasonable\r\ncause that can be assigned for the accumulation of the remains of these\r\nanimals is, that the locality was inhabited by men of pastoral habits,\r\nbut yet to a certain extent dependent on the chase, and that the relics\r\nof their food were thrown out to form a refuse-heap. The latter had\r\naltogether disappeared from the surface of the ground, from the action\r\nof the rain and other atmospheric causes, while those portions of it\r\nwhich chanced to be washed into the narrow interspace between the\r\nstrata were preserved, to mark the spot which it once occupied.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the deposit that fixes the date of its\r\naccumulation. It may have been of the stone, bronze, or iron age; but\r\nfrom the presence of the goat, short-horned ox, and dog, it certainly\r\ndoes not date so far back as the epoch of the reindeer, mammoth,\r\nrhinoceros, and cave-hyæna. The presence of the Celtic short-horn\r\nthrows no light upon the antiquity, because for centuries after it\r\nhad ceased to be the domestic breed in England it remained in Wales,\r\nand still lives in the small black Welsh cattle, that are lineal\r\ndescendants of those which furnished beef to the Roman provincials in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sepulchral Caves._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Section of Cave at Perthi-Chwareu. Scale 12\r\nfeet to 1 inch.]\r\n\r\nWhile the refuse-heap was being explored, I chose a small depression\r\n(Fig. 36 A) in the precipitous side of the southern ridge, that formed\r\na kind of rock shelter overlooking the valley, and that seemed to be\r\na likely place for the abode of man, or of wild animals. On setting\r\nthe men to work, in a few minutes we began to discover the remains of\r\ndog, marten-cat, fox, badger, goat, Celtic short-horn, roe-deer and\r\nstag, horse, and large birds. Mixed with these, as we proceeded, we\r\nbegan to find human bones, between and underneath large masses of rock,\r\nthat were completely covered up with red silt and sand. As these were\r\ncleared away, we gradually realized that we were on the threshold of\r\na sepulchral cave. In the small space then excavated, human remains,\r\nbelonging to no fewer than five individuals, were found. Subsequently\r\nthe work was carried on by Mrs. Lloyd, under the careful supervision\r\nof her agent Mr. Reid. The rock-shelter narrowed into a “tunnel cave,”\r\nthat penetrated the rocks in a line parallel to the bedding, and,\r\nroughly speaking, at right angles to the valley, having a width varying\r\nfrom 3 feet 4 inches to 5 feet 6 inches, and a height from 3 feet 4\r\ninches to 4 feet 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe entrance was completely blocked up with red earth and loose stones,\r\nthe latter, apparently, having been placed there by design (Figs. 36,\r\n37). The inside of the cave was filled with red earth and sand to\r\nwithin about a foot of the roof. The remains were found, for the most\r\npart, on or near the top; but in some cases they were deep down. One\r\nhuman skull, for example, was found six inches only above the rocky\r\nfloor. The human bones were associated with those of the animals of\r\nwhich a list has been given, and occurred in little confused heaps.\r\nOne human femur was in a perpendicular position. The account of the\r\ncontinuation of the digging is given almost in the words of Mrs.\r\nLloyd. On the second day, after an hour’s work, a human skull was\r\nfound near the roof of the cave, resting on a femur; then eleven feet\r\nexplored brought to light a large quantity of human bones, including\r\nnine femurs. The third and fourth days were devoted to clearing out\r\nthe cave (Fig. 36-7 B) up to this point, and to excavating about four\r\nfeet further in, or fifteen from the entrance. During the work two\r\nteeth of a horse were found, resting on the floor near the entrance,\r\nand nine more about ten feet within the cave; also a boar’s tusk of\r\nremarkable size, and close by a mussel and cockle-shell, and valve\r\nof _Mya truncata_, along with a quantity of human and other bones;\r\nincluding five skulls, more or less perfect, and many fragments. All\r\nthese skulls were found between the tenth and fifteenth feet from the\r\nentrance. During the fifth and sixth days, the work was superintended\r\nby Mr. Reid, who entirely cleared the cave for about thirteen feet\r\nfurther: the first eight feet yielded a small quantity of human and\r\nother bones, including the perfect skull of a marten-cat and the\r\nincisor of a wild boar. The only implement found in the cave, a broken\r\nflint flake, occurred here, and a nearly perfect human skull, lying\r\nface downwards, with the pelvis adhering to one side. The last five\r\nfeet furnished only two bones, both of the short-horned ox. The end of\r\nthe cave was composed of unproductive grey clay. (Figs. 36-7 C.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Plan of Cave at Perthi-Chwareu.]\r\n\r\nSmall fragments of charcoal occurred throughout the cave, and a great\r\nmany rounded pebbles from the boulder clay of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe human remains belong for the most part to very young or adolescent\r\nindividuals, from the small infant to youths of twenty-one. Some,\r\nhowever, belong to men in the prime of life. All the teeth that had\r\nbeen used were ground perfectly flat. The skulls belong to that type\r\nwhich Professor Huxley terms the “river-bed skull.” Some of the tibiæ\r\npresent the peculiar flattening parallel to the median line, which\r\nProfessor Busk denotes by the term platycnemic, and some of the femora\r\nwere traversed by a largely developed and prominent _linea aspera_;\r\nbut these peculiarities were not seen on all the femora and tibiæ,\r\nand cannot therefore be considered characteristic of race, but most\r\nprobably of sex. They were not presented by any of the younger bones.\r\n\r\nAll the human remains had undoubtedly been buried in the cave, since\r\nthe bones were in the main perfect, or only broken by the large stones\r\nwhich had subsequently fallen from the roof. From the juxtaposition\r\nof one skull to a pelvis, and the vertical position of one of the\r\nfemora, as well as the fact that the bones lay in confused heaps, it\r\nis clear that the corpses had been buried in the contracted posture,\r\nas is usually the case in neolithic interments. And since the area was\r\ninsufficient for the accommodation of so many bodies at one time, it is\r\ncertain that the cave had been used as a cemetery at different times.\r\nThe stones blocking up the entrance were probably placed as a barrier\r\nagainst the inroads of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nThese remains are the first in this country which present the peculiar\r\ncharacter of platycnemism, noticed by Professor Busk and Dr. Falconer\r\nin human remains in the caves of Gibraltar, and by Dr. Broca in some of\r\nthose from the dolmens of France, and subsequently in the celebrated\r\nskeletons found in the cave of Cro-magnon. I have also observed the\r\nsame peculiar flattening of the tibia in the only fragment of human\r\nbone obtained by Mr. Foote, in the Lateritic deposits of the eastern\r\ncoast of Southern India, along with the stone implements figured in the\r\nNorwich Volume of the International Congress of Prehistoric Archæology\r\n(1868, p. 224).\r\n\r\nThe remains of the animals associated with the human bones belong\r\nto the same species as those mentioned above from the débris of a\r\nrefuse-heap, and are in a similar broken and split condition. They may\r\nhave been deposited at the same time as the human skeletons, but, from\r\nthe fact that some of them are gnawed by dogs, it is most probable\r\nthat they were accumulated while the cave was used as a dwelling. If\r\nthe bodies were placed on an old floor of occupation, and afterwards\r\ndisturbed by rabbits and badgers, the remains would be mingled together\r\nas they were found to be mingled. The contents had evidently been\r\ndisturbed by the burrowing of all these animals.\r\n\r\nSubsequently we discovered and explored no less than four other\r\nsepulchral caves, within a few hundred yards of the refuse-heap, in\r\nwhich the corpses had been buried in the same crouching posture. From\r\none on the farm of Rhosdigre we obtained a perfect celt of polished\r\ngreenstone which had never been used (Fig. 38), together with several\r\nflint flakes, and numerous fragments of pottery, rude, black inside,\r\nhand-made, and containing in their substance small fragments of\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nSimilar potsherds are preserved in the Oxford Museum, from the\r\nsuperficial deposits of the caves of Gailenreuth and Kuhlock, and I\r\nhave observed them also among the remains from Kent’s Hole. The celt\r\nwas most probably, from its unworn condition, buried with the dead, and\r\nit stamps the neolithic age of the interments of the whole group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Greenstone Celt, Rhosdigre Cave. (Nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nAmong the broken bones from this cave were the teeth of the brown\r\nbear, and the lower jaw of a wolf; and the fractured bones of the\r\ndog implied that that animal ministered to the appetite, as well as\r\nobeyed the commands, of the neolithic inhabitants. I have met with\r\nsimilar evidence of the use of dog’s flesh for food among the broken\r\nbones which Canon Greenwell obtained from the neolithic tumuli of the\r\nYorkshire Wolds. On the other hand, the marks of the teeth of dogs, or\r\nwolves, on some of the human femora, implied that those animals made\r\ntheir way into this cave and feasted on the corpses.\r\n\r\nThe neolithic age of these interments is proved, not merely by the\r\npresence of the stone axe, or of the flint flakes, but by the burial in\r\na contracted posture,[97] and the fact that the skulls are identical\r\nwith those obtained from chambered tombs in the south of England proved\r\nto be neolithic by Dr. Thurnam.\r\n\r\nThe number of skeletons of all ages, and of both sexes, buried in\r\nthese caves was very considerable; and they had been placed on the\r\nold floor of occupation at successive times. In that of Rhosdigre\r\nthe accumulation of charcoal, broken bones, and fragments of pottery\r\nbelow some of the human skeletons, proved that it had been used for a\r\nhabitation before it was used for a burial-place. It is very probable\r\nthat originally the head of a family, or a clan, or a tribe, was buried\r\nin his own cave-dwelling, and that it was afterwards used as a cemetery\r\nfor his blood relations and followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Neolithic Caves in the neighbourhood of Cefn, near St. Asaph._\r\n\r\nThe same class of remains, referable to the neolithic age, have been\r\nmet with in the caves in the limestone cliffs of the beautiful valleys\r\nof the Clwyd and the Elwy, near St. Asaph. In the collection of fossil\r\nbones in the possession of Mrs. Williams Wynn, discovered in 1833, in a\r\ncave at Cefn, by Mr. Edward Lloyd,[98] is a human skull and lower jaw,\r\nalong with platycnemic limb-bones. They were found mingled with the\r\nbones of goat, pig, fox, and badger, and cut antlers of the red-deer,\r\ninside the lower entrance of the cave, in which the extinct pleistocene\r\nanimals were found in the valley of the Elwy. Four flint flakes also\r\nwere discovered along with them.\r\n\r\nThe skull in its general features strongly resembles those found in the\r\ngroup of caves at Perthi-Chwareu, and presents a cephalic index[99]\r\nof ·770, which comes within the limits of the extreme forms from that\r\nlocality. Professor Busk, however, as will be seen in his account of\r\nthis skull, because of its low altitudinal index--·702, as compared\r\nwith ·710 of the lowest Perthi-Chwareu skull--is inclined to view it as\r\nof a different type. The conditions, on the other hand, under which it\r\nwas found appear to me to be circumstantial evidence that the interment\r\nis of the same relative age as that of Perthi-Chwareu. Both were in\r\ncaves: in both the remains of the same domestic and wild animals were\r\nfound in the same fragmentary condition. Flint flakes also occurred\r\nin both; and what is more important, the platycnemic limb-bones in\r\nboth imply a somewhat similar mode of life in the people to whom they\r\nbelonged. This body of evidence, in favour of the interments having\r\nbeen made by the same race of men who lived some time in Denbighshire,\r\nseems to me of greater weight than that to the contrary afforded by\r\nthe difference of ·008 in the altitudinal indices of the skulls. After\r\na comparison of the carefully prepared measurements of the crania\r\npublished in the “Crania Britannica” with those published elsewhere,\r\nI cannot resist the conviction, that if similar modes of life and of\r\nburial in Britain imply an identity of race, cranial variation within\r\nthe limits of that race is by no means very small. Absolute purity of\r\nblood in an island so near the Continent as Britain cannot be looked\r\nfor; and unity of type resulting from isolation from other races, such\r\nas that presented by the Australians, is not likely to be met with. It\r\nis therefore very probable that some of the variations may be accounted\r\nfor by the blending of different ethnical elements in one race. I am\r\nconsequently inclined to view the interments in these two caves as\r\nhaving been made by the same people, in spite of the small cranial\r\ndifference manifested by the Cefn skull.\r\n\r\nThe cave in Brysgill, a small ravine leading into the valley of the\r\nElwy, explored by Mr. Mainwaring and Mrs. Williams Wynn in 1871,\r\nfurnished evidence of the occupation of man, probably of the neolithic\r\nage. From a dark layer composed of loam, black with fragments of\r\ncharcoal, a flint arrow-head, a core, a flake, and broken bones of the\r\nhorse, _Bos longifrons_, goat, and dog, were obtained, as well as a few\r\nhuman bones which had not been broken by design.\r\n\r\nThe excavations carried on in the small tunnel-cave of Plas-Heaton, by\r\nMr. Heaton and Professor Hughes, have shown that it was inhabited at\r\ntwo different ages. In the upper or prehistoric stratum were broken\r\nbones of the dog, badger, goat, _Bos longifrons_, and stag; while in\r\nthe lower, or pleistocene, were the remains of the hyæna, reindeer,\r\ncave-bear, and the lower jaw of the glutton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chambered Tomb near Cefn, St. Asaph._\r\n\r\nWhile the caves at Perthi-Chwareu were being explored, the accidental\r\ndiscovery of human remains in the cairn of Tyddyn Bleiddyn, near Cefn,\r\nSt. Asaph, in 1869, led to a systematic examination of its contents by\r\nMrs. Williams Wynn, under the superintendence of the Rev. D. R. Thomas,\r\nmyself, and the Rev. H. H. Winwood, which has resulted in the proof,\r\nthat the people who buried their dead in caves used stone-chambered\r\ntombs for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe cairn of loose fragments of limestone had been removed for\r\nroad-mending before the cap-stones of the stone chamber were exposed,\r\nand these were broken before any scientific observation was made. The\r\nRev. D. R. Thomas, however, rescued many of the human remains from\r\ndestruction, and began the exploration which defined the extent of the\r\nchamber A (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Plain of Chambered Tomb at Cefn.]\r\n\r\nSubsequently it was resumed in my presence, and the chamber A (Fig.\r\n39) fully cleared out. At the point _c_ it was partially shut off\r\nfrom the passage B by a slab of stone 18 inches high. The passage led\r\nfrom the chamber in a northern direction, and was 6 feet long by 2\r\nwide. The chamber gradually narrowed towards the passage, being 5 feet\r\nwide at its broad end, and 9 feet long. In the passage, as well as\r\nin the chamber, there were human bones belonging to individuals who\r\nhad been buried in a crouching posture. Unfortunately, as the remains\r\nhave been scattered, it is impossible to ascertain the exact number of\r\nthe burials. I have, however, restored one skull and examined seven\r\nfrontal bones, and other remains, which indicate that there were at\r\nleast twelve persons, varying in age from infancy to full prime, buried\r\nin this tomb. In addition to these, there is a large box of bones in\r\nthe possession of the Rev. D. R. Thomas, as well as other remains in\r\nother hands. But although the exact number of bodies interred cannot\r\nbe made out, there is full proof that there were too many to have\r\nbeen deposited at one time in so small a cubic area; and therefore\r\nthey must have been deposited at different times, as in the caves\r\nat Perthi-Chwareu. There were no remains of either wild or domestic\r\nanimals; and the only foreign object was a small slightly chipped flint\r\npebble. From the remarkable conformation of the nasal bones of some of\r\nthe skulls, it would seem likely that the burial-place belonged to one\r\nfamily; but, for a reason (see Notes on Human Remains, p. 183) stated\r\nby Professor Busk, this is by no means a certain inference.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the chamber and passage corresponds with that of the long\r\nbarrow of West Kennet, figured in the “Crania Britannica,” and with\r\nthat of the cromlech of Le Creux des Fées, Guernsey, described by\r\nLieutenant Oliver.[100] In the former of these the corpses were buried\r\nin a contracted posture, along with flint scrapers and fragments of\r\nrude pottery. In the latter the original contents have disappeared. To\r\nspeak in general terms, the chamber and passage belong to the class of\r\ntombs which Dr. Thurnam names “Long Barrows,” and Professor Nilsson\r\n“Ganggräben,” and which are found in Scandinavia and France, as well\r\nas in Britain. And it is worthy of note that the partial insulation of\r\nthe chamber A (Fig. 39) from the passage B by a slab (_c_), which does\r\nnot reach up to the height of the walls, is to be seen in similar tombs\r\nboth in Guernsey and in Brittany.\r\n\r\nA second and larger chamber, composed of cave slabs of limestone,\r\nwas discovered in the same cairn in 1871 by the Rev. D. R. Thomas,\r\nand completely excavated by him along with myself and the Rev. H. H.\r\nWinwood. It was of a rudely triangular form, 10 feet long by 6 wide,\r\ntraversed by a partition of slabs, and provided with a narrow passage\r\n10 feet long by 2 feet 6 in width, opening to the north, and fenced off\r\ncompletely from the chamber by a slab, as in the preceding case. Both\r\nthe chamber and the passage were full of human remains of all ages,\r\nburied in a contracted posture; the number of interments being far too\r\ngreat to have allowed the bodies to have been deposited at one time.\r\nFrom the former I identified the broken jaw of a roebuck and remains of\r\ngoat, a broken flint, and round pebbles of quartz, while in the latter\r\nthere were the teeth and bones of the dog and the pig.\r\n\r\nSome of the tibiæ from both the chambers were platycnemic, but that\r\ncharacter was only to be recognized in the older bones. The skulls,\r\nfrom the second of the two chambers, agree so exactly with those from\r\nthe caves, that it is not necessary to add to the table of measurements\r\nwhich Professor Busk has drawn up (p. 171).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Correlation of Chambered Tomb with Interments in the Caves of\r\nPerthi-Chwareu and Cefn._\r\n\r\nNor are we without evidence that the builders of this cairn belonged\r\nto the same race as those who buried their dead in the caves of\r\nPerthi-Chwareu and of Cefn. The crania and the limb-bones are\r\nidentical, and in both the tombs and caves the dead were buried in a\r\ncontracted posture.\r\n\r\nWhy then, it may be asked, were the remains of animals so rare in the\r\none and so abundant in the other? In my opinion this difference may\r\nbe explained by the hypothesis, invented by Professor Nilsson, of the\r\norigin of chambered tombs.[101] The idea of the “gallery graves,”\r\naccording to that high authority, was derived from the subterranean\r\nhouse in which the deceased lived, and in which he was buried after\r\nhis death, after the fashion of the Eskimos at the present day. The\r\nplan of the houses, like that of the ancient Lycian dwellings described\r\nby Sir Charles Fellowes, was preserved in the tombs, and probably for\r\nmany ages after houses were no longer made in that fashion; since the\r\nprinciple of conservatism and the force of custom are more deeply\r\nrooted in religious and solemn ceremonial than in the changes of\r\nevery-day life.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of the remains of the animals may be explained by the\r\nfact of these tombs never having been used as dwellings, while their\r\nabundance in the caves may be accounted for by the latter having been\r\ninhabited by man, and thus the idea of the dead resting in his own\r\nhouse would be the cause of burial both in caves and chambered tombs.\r\nIt is not at all strange that the same race should have used both for\r\nsepulture, when we consider that a “gallery grave” is an artificial\r\ncave, and that natural caves are few in number.\r\n\r\nThis ancient race is proved by the remains to have been pastoral,\r\nrather than dependent on the chase, their principal food being the\r\ndomestic goat, the short-horn (_Bos longifrons_), the horse, and\r\nhog. They are also proved to have been neolithic, not merely by the\r\ndiscovery of a polished stone axe in one of the caves, but also by the\r\nshape of the “gallery graves,” which Professor Nilsson and Dr. Thurnam\r\nagree in referring to that stage of culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table of Contents of Caves and Chambered Tomb._\r\n\r\nThe contents of the caves and the stone chambers may be gathered from\r\nthe Table which we give on the next page.\r\n\r\nThe broken bones of the hare prove that there was no prejudice against\r\nits flesh, as was the case among the neolithic dwellers in the Swiss\r\nPfahlbauten. We shall see in the next chapter that the animal was\r\nalso eaten by the dwellers in the neolithic caves both of France and\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Objects in Neolithic Caves and Cairn in North Wales._\r\n\r\n  Column-heading Key:\r\n  A Refuse-heap, Perthi-Chwareu.\r\n  B Cave No. 1.\r\n  C Cave No. 2.\r\n  D Cave Rhosdigre No. 1.\r\n  E Cave Rhosdigre No. 2.\r\n  F Cave Rhosdigre No. 3.\r\n  G The Cefn Cave.\r\n  H Cairn of Tyddyn Bleiddyn, near Cefn.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |              ANIMALS.              | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |\r\n  +------------------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |             DOMESTIC.              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Canis familiaris_--Dog             | X | X | X | X | X | X |   | X |\r\n  |_Sus scrofa_--Pig                   | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\r\n  |_Equus caballus_--Horse             | X | X | X | X | X | X |   |   |\r\n  |_Bos longifrons_--Celtic Short-horn | X | X | X | X | X | X |   |   |\r\n  |_Capra hircus_--Goat                | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\r\n  |                                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |                WILD.               |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Canis lupus_--Wolf                 |   |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Canis vulpes_--Fox                 | X | X | X | X | X |   | X |   |\r\n  |_Meles taxus_--Badger               | X | X | X | X | X |   | X |   |\r\n  |_Ursus arctos_--Bear                |   |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Sus scrofa_--Wild Boar             |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Cervus elaphus_--Stag              | X | X |   | X |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Cervus capreolus_--Roe             | X | X |   |   |   |   |   | X |\r\n  |_Lepus cuniculus_--Rabbit           | X | X | X | X | X |   |   |   |\r\n  |_Lepus timidus_--Hare               | X | X |   | X | X |   |   |   |\r\n  |                                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Polished Celts                      |   |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Flint Flakes or Chips               |   | X |   | X |   |   | X | X |\r\n  |Pottery                             |   |   |   | X | X | X | X |   |\r\n  |Human Skeletons                     |   | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\r\n  |Platycnemic bones                   |   | X | X | X | X | X | X | X |\r\n  +------------------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of the Human Remains by Professor Busk._\r\n\r\nFor the following account of the human remains, reprinted from the\r\n“Journal of the Ethnological Society,” January 1871, I am indebted to\r\nthe kindness of my friend Professor Busk, to whom examples of all the\r\nforms were forwarded:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Notes on the Human Remains._ By Professor BUSK, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  § 1. INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n  The remains discovered in the sepulchral cave at Perthi-Chwareu,\r\n  according to a list furnished by Mr. Boyd Dawkins, are as under;\r\n  but I believe this catalogue does not include all that were found\r\n  in the locality.[102]\r\n\r\n  1. Eleven more or less perfect skulls, some, however, represented\r\n  by mere fragments.\r\n\r\n  2. Twelve mandibles.\r\n\r\n  3. Seven arm-bones or _humeri_--four right and three left.\r\n\r\n  4. Six _ulnæ_.\r\n\r\n  5. Twenty-two thigh-bones, including five pairs, five odd ones of\r\n  the right side, and seven of the left; and amongst them are three\r\n  of very young children.\r\n\r\n  6. Seventeen _tibiæ_ or leg-bones, nine of the right and eight of\r\n  the left side, and apparently none of them in pairs; so that there\r\n  must probably have been a good many more.\r\n\r\n  7. Eight _astragali_.\r\n\r\n  8. Nine _calcanea_, or heel-bones.\r\n\r\n  The number of individuals, therefore, whose relics were deposited\r\n  in this cavern could not have been less than sixteen, and may have\r\n  been many more. They appear to have been of all ages and of both\r\n  sexes.\r\n\r\n  Of the other bones of the skeleton, of which there must have been\r\n  abundance, I have received no information.\r\n\r\n  In the Cefn Cave there were discovered:--\r\n\r\n    1. One mandible.\r\n    2. One _humerus_.\r\n    3. Two _ulnæ_.\r\n    4. A pair of thigh-bones.\r\n    5. A pair of leg-bones.\r\n\r\n  and in the tumulus:--\r\n\r\n    1. Portions of seven skulls.\r\n    2. Two right _humeri_.\r\n    3. A pair of _ulnæ_.\r\n    4. A right _femur_.\r\n\r\n  From St. Asaph the only bone that has come under my observation is\r\n  a single _calvaria_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE BONES FROM THE CAVERN AT PERTHI-CHWAREU.\r\n\r\n  (a.) _General Condition._--In general condition, as regards colour\r\n  and texture, these bones present some, but no very striking,\r\n  differences; on the whole they are much alike, though it might\r\n  be supposed that some have lain longer in the ground than the\r\n  others. One or two among them (but these are apparently the\r\n  younger bones) are fragile; the majority, however, are as firm as\r\n  common churchyard bones, and some have quite the natural degree of\r\n  hardness. They are of a lightish-yellow colour, do not adhere to\r\n  the tongue, and afford scarcely any earthy smell when breathed upon\r\n  or moistened: only one among them presents any staining from oxide\r\n  of manganese; and this exists in diffuse blotches, and is not at\r\n  all of the dendritic form. Many are partially covered with a very\r\n  thin film of crystalline carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 40, 41, 42.--Skull from Sepulchral Cave at\r\n  Perthi-Chwareu.]\r\n\r\n  (b.) _The Skulls._--Of these only three of the more perfect have\r\n  come under my observation. These alone will form the subject of\r\n  what I have to remark on this portion of the skeleton. But in\r\n  the subjoined Table I. (p. 171) I have given, together with the\r\n  dimensions of these three, those of five others which have been\r\n  furnished to me by Mr. Dawkins.\r\n\r\n  In the specimen No. 1 (Figs 40, 41, 42) the entire facial part\r\n  is wanting, together with the whole of the base and a great part\r\n  of one side of the _calvaria_. The skull is of an oval form,\r\n  symmetrical, with a rather prominent occiput. The region of the\r\n  vertex is slightly and evenly arched; and the forehead, though\r\n  not high, is vertical, and slightly compressed on the sides. The\r\n  sutures are all open and finely serrated. The frontal sinuses\r\n  are distinct though small. The supra-orbital ridge is thin, but\r\n  rather prominent towards the external angular process. The mastoid\r\n  processes are very large, and the digastric _fossa_ remarkably\r\n  deep. The occipital spine is very prominent, as are the lateral\r\n  ridges. The temporal ridges, also, and, in short, all the muscular\r\n  impressions, are very strongly marked.\r\n\r\n  The skull is evidently that of a powerful, muscular man, in the\r\n  prime of life, and apparently of robust, but not coarse build.[103]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 43, 44, 45.--Skull from Sepulchral Cave at\r\n  Perthi-Chwareu.]\r\n\r\n  Skull No. 2 (Figs. 43, 44, 45) is that of an adult male,\r\n  presenting as nearly as possible the same dimensions, form,\r\n  and other characters as that above described, except that the\r\n  bone is somewhat thicker and heavier. The muscular ridges and\r\n  impressions are even more strongly developed than in the former,\r\n  and especially the temporal ridges immediately above the external\r\n  angular processes. The left _maxilla_ remains loosely attached,\r\n  containing the two bicuspid teeth, which are of small size, and\r\n  worn quite flat, and to such an extent as to render it probable\r\n  that the man was somewhat advanced in years, although none of the\r\n  sutures are closed. The face is strictly orthognathous, and the\r\n  skull dolichocephalic and aphanozygous.[104]\r\n\r\n  Skull No. 3 is the entire _calvaria_ of a very young individual.\r\n  The two milk-molars remain on either side; and behind them the\r\n  first true molar is fully out, but not in the least worn. The\r\n  incisors and canines have fallen out. The former, from the size of\r\n  the _alveoli_, were of the permanent set, but not the latter. The\r\n  age of the individual, therefore, may be estimated as about seven\r\n  or eight.\r\n\r\n  The only point worthy of notice in this _calvaria_ is the existence\r\n  of a well-marked depression across the middle of the occipital\r\n  bone, which appears exactly as if it had been caused by the\r\n  constriction of a bandage. The depression barely extends beyond\r\n  the lambdoidal suture into the parietals. It requires, perhaps,\r\n  some imagination to perceive the slight traces of a corresponding\r\n  depression in the forepart of the skull; but I think a faint\r\n  depression may be there perceived on careful inspection. The effect\r\n  of the occipital constriction, if it be such, reminds one of some\r\n  of the deformed French skulls described by M. Foville[105] and by\r\n  M. Gosse.[106] In all other respects the skull is well formed and\r\n  symmetrical. It is strictly orthognathous, and of a broad oval\r\n  shape.\r\n\r\n  If deformed artificially, it would come under the head of “tête\r\n  annulaire” of M. Gosse; and Dr. Foville shows that this kind of\r\n  deformation arises from the popular custom of applying a kind of\r\n  bandage round the head of the new-born infant, which, passing\r\n  over the anterior fontanelle, descends obliquely, and is crossed\r\n  behind the occiput and brought back and tied in front. This band,\r\n  or “serre-tête,” he states, is worn during the first year, and\r\n  for a longer period by female children than by males. Dr. Lunier\r\n  gives pretty nearly the same account, adding, however, further\r\n  particulars.[107] It may be remarked, also, that the Berbers, who\r\n  formed great part of the Moorish forces that invaded Europe in\r\n  the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, used to elongate the skull\r\n  posteriorly and flatten the forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE I.--_Dimensions of Perthi-Chwareu

mean would be ·785.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n  (c.) _Thigh-bones._--I have had an opportunity of examining only\r\n  a single perfect specimen of the thigh-bones. This is an entire\r\n  bone, 18·2 inches long, with a least circumference of 3·5. Its\r\n  perimetral index[108] consequently is ·192, which is about the\r\n  normal standard. The _linea aspera_, at the middle of the bone more\r\n  especially, is very prominent, so that the bone may be termed, in\r\n  some degree, carinated (Fig. 46). The shaft is straight; and the\r\n  chief peculiarities, besides the prominent _linea aspera_, which it\r\n  presents, are (1) an unusual compression in the antero-posterior\r\n  direction in the upper part, for the extent of about three inches\r\n  below the _trochanter minor_. At about two inches below that\r\n  process, or at a point corresponding with the lower part of the\r\n  insertion of the _pectineus_ muscle, the shaft measures ·9 × 1·45,\r\n  whilst in three other ordinary _femora_ with which I have compared\r\n  it, the bone at the corresponding part measures ·9 × 1·20, ·9\r\n  × 1·10, ·9 × 1·15, showing that the Perthi-Chwareu _femur_ is\r\n  unusually expanded laterally in the upper part of the shaft. The\r\n  consequence is to give the bone at that part a peculiar aspect,\r\n  which is especially seen in an acute internal angle, and one rather\r\n  less acute externally, instead of the usually rounded internal and\r\n  external borders. (2) The distal extremity appears to be rather\r\n  disproportionately large as compared with a recent well-formed bone\r\n  of the same length, the condyles measuring 2·5 × 3·3 instead of 2·4\r\n  × 3·05; and the lower part of the shaft is also somewhat expanded.\r\n  But the chief peculiarity, as above remarked, is the compression of\r\n  the shaft in the upper part. Besides the _linea aspera_, all the\r\n  muscular impressions are strongly marked, and especially those for\r\n  the insertion of the _gluteus maximus_ and the _trochanter minor_.\r\n  The neck is long and very oblique, and the head, upon which only\r\n  a small portion of the articular surface is left, must have had a\r\n  diameter of about 1·9.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Boyd Dawkins has furnished me with the principal dimensions of\r\n  several other _femora_, varying in length from 16 to 18 inches,\r\n  and affording an average length of about 17, corresponding to a\r\n  mean height of the individuals of about 5 ft. 4 in. to 5 ft. 5 in.,\r\n  the tallest being perhaps 5 ft. 6 in., and the shortest about\r\n  5 ft. 2 in., no doubt a woman. The mean perimetral index of the\r\n  eight _femora_ is ·186, which shows, in comparison with the usual\r\n  thickness of well-formed male thigh-bones of the present day, a\r\n  certain degree of slenderness. That this is not altogether owing\r\n  to the circumstance that the bones include those of perhaps more\r\n  than one female is proved by the fact that in no instance does the\r\n  perimetral index exceed ·192, and in one thigh-bone, 18″·2 long, it\r\n  is not more, if the circumference is correctly given, than ·178,\r\n  the normal perimetral index for the adult male _femur_ in this\r\n  country being taken as about ·194.\r\n\r\n  (d.) _Tibiæ._--Of the leg-bones brought under my notice, five are\r\n  entire and five more or less defective.

In accordance with this, we find that the mean\r\n  transverse diameter of the shaft at the point above indicated is\r\n  greatly under the usual mark, viz. as 79 to 91.\r\n\r\n  It is clear, therefore, that the Perthi-Chwareu _tibiæ_ are more\r\n  compressed or flattened than the usual run of modern European\r\n  _tibiæ_; in other words, they belong to the platycnemic type.\r\n\r\n  As this is, I believe, the first instance in which the occurrence\r\n  of _tibiæ_ of this peculiar conformation has been observed in\r\n  this country, the circumstance is of some interest, especially\r\n  with relation to the occurrence of priscan bones of the same type\r\n  elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  This peculiar conformation of the _tibia_, to which we gave the\r\n  name of “platycnemic,” was, I believe, first noticed by Dr.\r\n  Falconer and myself, in 1863, in the human remains procured by\r\n  Captain Brome from the Genista Cave, on Windmill Hill, Gibraltar,\r\n  of which an account will be found in the Transactions of the\r\n  International Congress of Prehistoric Archæology for the year 1868\r\n  (p. 161); and about the same time, or in May 1864, M. Broca[109]\r\n  independently observed the same condition in _tibiæ_ procured from\r\n  the dolmen of Chamant (Oise), and afterwards in bones from the\r\n  dolmen of Maintenon (Eure-et-Loire). Similar bones have since been\r\n  noticed in other localities on the Continent, as, for instance,\r\n  in the diluvium of Montmartre, by M. Eugène Bertrand. But that\r\n  the peculiarity in question is not common in all the varieties of\r\n  priscan man belonging to the reindeer period is shown by the fact\r\n  that it has not been observed in any of the _tibiæ_ exhumed by M.\r\n  Dupont in the Belgian caves.\r\n\r\n  M. Broca’s almost exhaustive remarks upon the anatomical,\r\n  physiological, and pathological relations of this form of _tibia_\r\n  leave but little to be said under those heads. I would, however,\r\n  venture to add a few words as to its ethnological significance. But\r\n  before doing so I would remark that there appear to be two forms\r\n  of platycnemism, apparently indicative of some difference in the\r\n  cause or nature of this aberration from the more usual shape of the\r\n  bone. To save many words, I subjoin outlines of several well-marked\r\n  instances of platycnemic bones, all drawn of the natural size and\r\n  in the same position, the letter (_a_) in each corresponding to the\r\n  interosseous ridge, and (_b_) to the _crista_ or shin.\r\n\r\n  The line _b c_, drawn through the _crista_ and the middle of the\r\n  posterior surface of the bone, is bisected by another (_a d_),\r\n  drawn at right angles to it, at the level of the interosseous\r\n  ridge.\r\n\r\n  In Fig. 47, which represents what may be regarded as a normal\r\n  _tibia_, the length of that portion of the antero-posterior line\r\n  which is behind the transverse line is to that of the anterior as\r\n  274 to 1,000, whilst in Fig. 48, taken from M. Broca’s outline of\r\n  the Cro-magnon _tibia_, which would seem to represent the extremest\r\n  degree of platycnemism as yet observed, the proportion in question\r\n  is as 623 to 1,000.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 47, 48.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 49, 50, 51.]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 49, 50, 51, are taken from as many of the Gibraltar\r\n  _tibiæ_,[110] in which the proportion varies from 600 to 523,\r\n  whilst it will be observed that in Figs. 52, 53, 54, taken from\r\n  the most platycnemic of the Perthi-Chwareu _tibiæ_, the proportion\r\n  in one only differs in any considerable degree from the extreme\r\n  normal proportion shown in Fig. 47; and in this it is as 512\r\n  to 1,000, whilst in Fig. 53, which is nevertheless undoubtedly\r\n  platycnemic, the proportion is exactly the same as in the most\r\n  triangular form of bone.\r\n\r\n  It would seem, therefore, that platycnemism may arise from an\r\n  unusual antero-posterior expansion of the bone, either in front or\r\n  behind the level of the interosseous ridge. What this difference\r\n  may indicate, or of what importance it may be in the consideration\r\n  of questions relating to platycnemism, I am not prepared to\r\n  discuss; but as in all probability it is connected with a\r\n  difference in the cause of the deformation (if it be deformation),\r\n  I have thought that the observation should be recorded, and would\r\n  merely, in addition, remark that, so far as I have noticed,\r\n  the occasional and not infrequent platycnemism observed in the\r\n  shin-bones of negroes is what may be termed anterior.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 52, 53, 54.]\r\n\r\n  With respect to the ethnological value of the platycnemic _tibia_,\r\n  I conceive we are as yet very much in the dark. That it is a\r\n  race-character would seem to me in the highest degree improbable,\r\n  seeing that it would be difficult to find any other points of\r\n  resemblance between the Cro-magnon platycnemic men and those\r\n  whose remains were met with in the Gibraltar caves, although the\r\n  platycnemism is of the same kind in each; and still less could\r\n  the former gigantic race be identified with the occupants of\r\n  the Perthi-Chwareu sepulchre, from whom they differ not only in\r\n  stature, but even more remarkably in cranial conformation.\r\n\r\n  If, then, platycnemism cannot be regarded as of any value as a\r\n  race-character, it can _a fortiori_ be still less looked upon as\r\n  indicative of simian tendencies, a notion that M. Broca seems\r\n  somewhat inclined to favour. It is quite true that the _tibiæ_\r\n  of the gorilla and of the chimpanzee are, to a certain extent,\r\n  platycnemic; but it is by no means so much so as the human\r\n  platycnemic bone. The _tibia_ of a male gorilla in the College of\r\n  Surgeons has a latitudinal index of ·681, and that of a female of\r\n  ·650, whilst that of the chimpanzee is ·611, or exactly the mean of\r\n  the Perthi-Chwareu bones. It is needless to insist upon the other\r\n  marked distinctions between the simian and the human _tibia_; but\r\n  as regards platycnemism it will be obvious, if we are disposed to\r\n  trace it to any genetic descent, that the descendant has, in this\r\n  respect, at one time far out-simianized the Simiæ.\r\n\r\n  But this comparison with the anthropoid apes may, perhaps, afford\r\n  ground for a suggestion respecting some possible connection\r\n  between this peculiar form of the _tibia_ and the habits of the\r\n  people amongst whom it has been observed. One great distinction\r\n  between the human and the simian foot consists in their respective\r\n  adaptations to totally distinct functions. In the one case it\r\n  is simply an organ of support and progression; in the other,\r\n  for the most part, of prehension. This necessarily involves a\r\n  considerable difference in the proportions, &c., of the muscles by\r\n  which the greater mobility and adaptability of the foot, and more\r\n  particularly of the digits, are ensured. Would it not, then, be\r\n  admissible to inquire how far, at any rate, posterior platycnemism\r\n  may be connected with the greater freedom of motion and general\r\n  adaptability of the toes enjoyed by those peoples whose feet have\r\n  not been subjected to the confinement of shoes or other coverings,\r\n  and who at the same time have been compelled to lead an active\r\n  existence in a rude and rugged or mountainous and wooded country,\r\n  where the exigencies of the chase would demand the utmost agility\r\n  in climbing and otherwise?\r\n\r\n  Some common cause of this kind would seem to be not improbable; and\r\n  it would not, perhaps, be difficult to ascertain whether it is a\r\n  _vera causa_ or not. But, with respect to this, observations are at\r\n  present wanting.\r\n\r\n  From the foregoing data we may conclude:--\r\n\r\n  (1) That the Perthi-Chwareu bones belonged to a race characterized\r\n  by the proportionally rather large dimensions of the cranium,\r\n  whose form presents nothing very remarkable, and is pretty nearly\r\n  conformable to several of those found by Mr. Laing in the ancient\r\n  shell-mounds in Shetland.[111]\r\n\r\n  (2) That this form is distinctly different from that of the\r\n  Mewslade skull, in which the vertical region is somewhat\r\n  flattened, as is the case also with several Anglesey crania,\r\n  which, however, appear to pass, by gradual transition, into the\r\n  Keiss and Perthi-Chwareu shape, through such a form as that of the\r\n  Towyn-y-capel skull figured by Professor Huxley;[112] and the whole\r\n  of them consequently may be regarded as belonging to the so-called\r\n  “River-bed skulls” of that author, excepting the Borris cranium,\r\n  which appears to belong to a different type altogether.\r\n\r\n  (3) That the people whose remains were found in this locality were\r\n  of low stature (the mean height, deduced from the lengths of the\r\n  long bones, being little more than 5 feet), the tallest being 5\r\n  ft. 6 in., and the shortest adult not more than 4 ft. 10 in., the\r\n  intermediate ones being 5 ft. 1 in. and 5 ft. 2 in.\r\n\r\n  (4) That the proportions of the long bones are rather thick, and\r\n  the muscular impressions in all are very strongly marked.\r\n\r\n  (5) That the _tibiæ_ are, for the most part, of a much more\r\n  compressed form than those of the modern English, but that this\r\n  platycnemism does not appear to be exactly of the same kind as\r\n  that which is exhibited in the Gibraltar bones and in those from\r\n  Cro-magnon (as figured by M. Broca), the difference consisting in\r\n  the fact that in the two latter instances the bone is expanded\r\n  backwards behind the transverse plane at the interosseous ridge as\r\n  much as it is in front of that plane, whilst in the Welsh _tibiæ_\r\n  it is the anterior portion of the shaft only which is expanded;\r\n  or, in other words, the platycnemism in them is due simply to an\r\n  absolute compression of the shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 3. HUMAN REMAINS FROM THE CEFN TUMULUS.\r\n\r\n  These remains, as submitted to my inspection, consist of:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Portions of three frontal bones, two of which are nearly\r\n  complete, and one constituted of little more than the superciliary\r\n  region.\r\n\r\n  (2) Two parietals and a left temporal, probably belonging to the\r\n  same skull as the more mutilated frontal.\r\n\r\n  (3) Portions of four thigh-bones, two left and two right, one of\r\n  the latter wanting the proximal, the other both extremities.\r\n\r\n  We have thus the remains of three individuals from this interment.\r\n\r\n  I. _The Frontal Bones._--No. 1. The least transverse diameter,\r\n  immediately behind the external angular processes, is 3″·6, and\r\n  its greatest (at the coronal suture) about 4″·3. Longitudinal arc,\r\n  4″·1. The profile outline of the forehead is slightly receding;\r\n  the frontal sinuses moderately developed; and the supraorbital\r\n  border thin and acute, whilst the glabellar eminence is large\r\n  and prominent. The bone is a good deal compressed on the sides,\r\n  so as to have almost the appearance of having formed part of a\r\n  cymbecephalic skull. The bone itself is thin, and probably without\r\n  any _diploë_.\r\n\r\n  No. 2 presents exactly the same characters, except that the\r\n  longitudinal arc is greater, being 5″·3. The postorbital or least\r\n  transverse diameter is 3″·4, and the coronal or greatest 4″·4.\r\n  The frontal sinuses are well developed; the supraorbital ridge\r\n  rather prominent, but thin and sharp; the external angular process\r\n  prominent and thick. Glabellar eminence large and prominent.\r\n  The nasals remain _in situ_, and project almost, if not quite,\r\n  horizontally forwards, with a rapid curve at first, and then\r\n  straight out. The general contour of the bone is exactly like that\r\n  of No. 1, in which also, although the nasals are wanting, the\r\n  position of the surface by which they were attached shows that they\r\n  must in all probability have resembled those of No. 2. The _crista\r\n  galli_ of the ethmoid, which is left _in situ_, is remarkably thick\r\n  and high.\r\n\r\n  No. 3 is a portion of a larger and wider bone, the postorbital\r\n  diameter being at least 4″·0. The frontal sinuses are very large,\r\n  but distinctly defined, as the remainder of the supraorbital border\r\n  is not thickened. Owing perhaps to the greater prominence of the\r\n  sinuses, the glabella does not appear so protuberant as in the\r\n  other instances. The nasal bones remain and project forwards in\r\n  the same curious fashion as in No. 2. The frontal crest on the\r\n  inner surface is remarkably developed, being at least half an inch\r\n  high, though it is separated by a wide notch from the equally\r\n  strongly developed _crista galli_ of the ethmoid.\r\n\r\n  No. 4, when the three bones of which it is composed are put\r\n  together, consists of the greater part of the parietal region of\r\n  the skull, to which, as before said, the last-described frontal\r\n  may have belonged. The left parietal is quite perfect; and a\r\n  considerable portion of the right also remains, together with the\r\n  entire left temporal; so that a very sufficient estimate of the\r\n  proportions of the parietal region of the skull can be obtained.\r\n\r\n  As well as can be estimated, the parietal longitudinal arc, or\r\n  length of the sagittal suture, is 5″·2. The vertical transverse\r\n  arc, or that drawn from one auditory foramen to the other, over\r\n  the point of junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures, is\r\n  12″·2, the parietal 13″, and the occipital 12″·2. In the temporal\r\n  bone, the external auditory foramen is large, the mastoid process\r\n  of moderate size, but the digastric fossa is wide and deep. The\r\n  channels for the middle meningeal artery and its branches are large\r\n  and deep; and very deep depressions on the sides of the sagittal\r\n  suture show that the _glandulæ Pacchioni_ must have been greatly\r\n  developed. The bone is very thin, and with scarcely a trace of\r\n  _diploë_ where its structure is visible. None of the sutures,\r\n  however, which are strongly serrated, are in the slightest degree\r\n  closed, although, as I should imagine, the skull must have been\r\n  that of a man beyond the middle period of life.\r\n\r\n  II. _The Thigh-bones._--Two of these bones, which, though much\r\n  alike, differ sufficiently to show that they did not belong to the\r\n  same individual, are decidedly carinate.\r\n\r\n  No. 1 wants the upper and lower ends. The least circumference\r\n  of the shaft, which is at a point about 3½ inches below the\r\n  _trochanter minor_, is 3″·2. That process, as well as all the\r\n  other muscular impressions, is strongly developed; and that for\r\n  the insertion of the _gluteus maximus_ is peculiar in presenting\r\n  the form of a deep elongated pit instead of a roughened elevation\r\n  as usual. The antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the\r\n  shaft, about 1½ inches below the _trochanter minor_, are ·85 × 1·4;\r\n  and the shaft at this part, like that of the above-described from\r\n  Perthi-Chwareu, presents a rather acute or narrow external and\r\n  internal border instead of the usual more rounded form. Lower down,\r\n  the shaft becomes strongly carinate; and, owing to the flattened\r\n  form of the anterior surface, its transverse section affords a\r\n  subtriangular figure (fig. 55). The walls, or cortical substance,\r\n  are rather thicker than usual, and the substance of the bone is\r\n  dense and hard.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\n  No. 2 is very similar in character to the foregoing, but is not\r\n  quite so much compressed in the upper part, measuring ·8 × 1·2.\r\n  Nevertheless the inner border is very acute, and the outer more so\r\n  than in the common form of _femur_. The shaft lower down is not so\r\n  strongly carinate as it is in the former instance, but is still so\r\n  in some degree (Fig. 56); and the walls (or cortical substance) are\r\n  still thicker in proportion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 57.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 58.]\r\n\r\n  No. 3. A third specimen consists of the lower half, or rather\r\n  more, of the right _femur_. The least circumference is 3″·2.\r\n  The bone exhibits no special external characters, and is in no\r\n  degree carinated. The shaft, at about the middle of its length,\r\n  is somewhat angular in front; and the pit for the origin of the\r\n  _popliteus_ muscle is deeper and perhaps larger than in most\r\n  bones of the same size. The texture of the cortical substance is\r\n  quite eburneous; and it is extremely thick, so that the medullary\r\n  canal is reduced to a calibre of little more than 0″·25 in its\r\n  longest diameter. The shaft, however, is straight, and exhibits\r\n  no other sign whatever of having been affected with _rachitis_.\r\n  It is, however, a curious circumstance that many of the Gibraltar\r\n  thigh-bones, most of which are carinate, present the same\r\n  thickening of the cortical substance (Fig. 57).\r\n\r\n  No. 4. A fourth specimen is constituted of merely a portion of the\r\n  shaft, about 12 inches long, and without either extremity. Its\r\n  least diameter is 3″·3, and its antero-posterior and transverse\r\n  diameters, at the same point as in the other bones, 1 × 1·25, or\r\n  pretty nearly in the usual proportions. Nevertheless the bone,\r\n  throughout its whole remaining extent, is less rounded on the\r\n  inner side of the shaft than is usual. The _trochanter minor_ is\r\n  of gigantic size; and the shaft of the bone, about and below the\r\n  middle, exhibits a subtriangular aspect (Fig. 58), though scarcely\r\n  to be called carinate. The cortical substance is of the normal\r\n  thickness.\r\n\r\n  III. _Tibiæ._--No. 1 consists of the greater portion of the left\r\n  tibia, wanting only the lower extremity. The proximal end measures\r\n  2·9 × 1·9; and the diameters of the shaft, about the middle,\r\n  are 1·2 × ·75, giving a latitudinal index of ·620. The shin is\r\n  remarkably sharp and prominent, and rather curved over to the outer\r\n  side; and the apparent compression or tendency to platycnemism may\r\n  in some measure be referred more to the production in front of the\r\n  anterior part of the bone than to actual narrowing of the posterior\r\n  side of the triangle, which is nevertheless rather more rounded\r\n  than in most cases. The axis of the shaft is quite straight; and\r\n  the bone has not the least rickety appearance.\r\n\r\n  No. 2 is also a portion of the left tibia. Both extremities are\r\n  wanting, and the bone offers nothing worthy of remark. Its least\r\n  circumference is 2″·65; and the shaft, at the middle, measures\r\n  1″·1 × ·65; so that the latitudinal index is about ·640, showing a\r\n  slight degree of compression. The entire length of the bone may be\r\n  estimated as rather more than 13 inches, corresponding to a height\r\n  of about 5 ft. 4 in. or 5 ft. 5 in., so that the subject may be\r\n  supposed to have been a female.\r\n\r\n  These remains represent at least four individuals--one probably\r\n  somewhat aged, another of strong and robust make, and one, in all\r\n  probability, a woman--in fact, a family group. No correct idea can\r\n  be formed of the cranial conformation of these persons. In general\r\n  shape it would seem to correspond with that of the Perthi-Chwareu\r\n  skulls; but two of them at any rate are of smaller size, if we\r\n  may judge from the least frontal diameter. The forehead also is\r\n  perhaps a little more reclined. The most striking feature in two\r\n  of the specimens, and which appears also to have existed in a\r\n  third, is the extraordinary projection forwards of the nasal bones.\r\n  In the present case this may probably be regarded as a family\r\n  peculiarity; but with reference to it, it should be remembered\r\n  that M. Broca[113] has described a very similar condition in the\r\n  skull of the “Old man” of Cro-magnon, in whom, he says, “the ridge\r\n  of the nose, slightly depressed at its base, rises again almost\r\n  immediately, and advances boldly forward, making a rapid curve,\r\n  with the concavity directed rather forward and especially upward,\r\n  so that the lower ends of the _ossa nasi_ are placed 18 mm. (·7\r\n  inch) in front of a line dropped vertically from the fronto-nasal\r\n  suture.”\r\n\r\n  The condition of the bones from the Cefn tumulus differs very\r\n  considerably from that of the remains from Perthi-Chwareu. They all\r\n  have an appearance of much greater antiquity. With the exception of\r\n  the very dense _femur_, they adhere to the tongue; and they are all\r\n  deeply stained with manganous oxide, by which the substance even of\r\n  the hardest portions is stained to a depth of more than one-eighth\r\n  of an inch. That this discoloration, which for the most part does\r\n  not assume the dendritic appearance, is due to manganese and not to\r\n  any vegetable stain, is quite certain.\r\n\r\n  The form of the skull, so far as it can be ascertained from\r\n  such imperfect remains, and the rather platycnemic shape of the\r\n  _tibiæ_, may perhaps justify our supposing that the Cefn bones\r\n  belong to a cognate race to those whose remains were deposited at\r\n  Perthi-Chwareu, or to one which had lived under similar conditions.\r\n  But the cranial data are hardly sufficient to allow of any\r\n  satisfactory inference being drawn from them: and as regards the\r\n  _tibiæ_, it has already been pointed out that platycnemism cannot,\r\n  in the present state of our knowledge, be regarded as an important\r\n  ethnological character amongst priscan peoples, though it may\r\n  undoubtedly be considered a character betokening remote antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 4. SKULL FROM THE CEFN CAVE, NEAR ST. ASAPH.\r\n\r\n  The only specimen of human remains from this locality is a nearly\r\n  entire _calvaria_, wanting the whole of the face below the\r\n  superciliary border.\r\n\r\n  In the middle of the left parietal bone is a small irregular\r\n  opening, with short radiating lines of fracture proceeding from it;\r\n  but this appears to have been recently caused, and from the inside.\r\n\r\n  The bone generally is of a brown colour, and, as regards firmness,\r\n  in a natural condition; and it does not adhere to the tongue.\r\n  Judging from its aspect alone, it would not appear to be of any\r\n  very great antiquity; but as it has lain in a dry soil, and\r\n  sheltered from rain or moisture, this appearance may be deceptive.\r\n\r\n  Its dimensions are given in Table I. (_supra_), from which it\r\n  will be seen that the cephalic or latitudinal index is ·770, and\r\n  the altitudinal ·702. It belongs, therefore, to the category of\r\n  subbrachy-cephalic skulls of Thurnam and Professor Huxley.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 59, 60, 61.--Skull from Cave at Cefn, St.\r\n  Asaph.]\r\n\r\n  In the side view (_norma lateralis_--Plate 7, Fig. 59), it so\r\n  closely resembles, except in one respect, that described and\r\n  figured by Professor Huxley (_loc. cit._ p. 125, Figs. 60, 61) from\r\n  the bed of the Nore, at Borris, in Ireland, that we can scarcely\r\n  refuse to recognize a common character between them, which, since\r\n  in the present case it cannot be looked upon as denoting a mere\r\n  family relationship, may reasonably be regarded as indicative of\r\n  some affinity of race. The chief difference observable in this view\r\n  of the two skulls is the greater development of the frontal sinuses\r\n  in the Borris _calvaria_. The occipital view (_norma occipitalis_,\r\n  Fig. 8) is also very similar, except that in the Borris skull the\r\n  greatest width appears to be in the temporal, and in the other the\r\n  parietal region. In the Borris skull, also, there is a shallow\r\n  groove in the course of the sagittal suture, which does not exist\r\n  in that from St. Asaph.\r\n\r\n  The Borris skull is said to be of the extraordinary length of 8\r\n  inches; and this may account for the much lower cephalic index\r\n  of the skull, whose absolute width in reality somewhat exceeds\r\n  the Cefn specimen (5″·9 and 5″·7), whilst the altitudinal as\r\n  compared with the latitudinal is but very little greater than it\r\n  would be were the skulls reduced to the same breadth. They may\r\n  both, therefore, be regarded as “low,” or, as this class of skull\r\n  might be termed, in the euphonious language of craniologists,\r\n  “tapinocephalic.” One great peculiarity of the Cefn _cranium_\r\n  (which exists also, but apparently not to quite so great a\r\n  degree, in the other) is the absolute horizontality of the plane\r\n  of the subinial portion of the occipital bone. And it is to this\r\n  flattening that the comparative lowness may perhaps be chiefly\r\n  attributed.\r\n\r\n  The sutures, where visible, appear to be open. The mastoid\r\n  processes and all other muscular impressions are strongly marked.\r\n\r\n  A third skull of very similar character, except that it is not so\r\n  much depressed, has come under my observation. It was discovered in\r\n  a submarine or, rather, subterranean peat-bed or ancient forest,\r\n  30 feet below the sea-level, at Sennen, near the Land’s End, in\r\n  Cornwall; and a brief notice and outline figure of it will be found\r\n  in the “Natural History Review” for 1861.[114] The Sennen skull has\r\n  the same elongated form; but it is higher than either the Cefn, St.\r\n  Asaph, or Borris crania, having an altitudinal index of ·730.\r\n\r\n  On the whole, these three skulls (_i.e._ those from Borris, Sennen,\r\n  and St. Asaph) would appear to have a common character, and to be\r\n  of a different type from either the Perthi-Chwareu or the Mewslade\r\n  form.\r\n\r\n  As a rule it may, I think, be stated that in all brachy-cephalic\r\n  skulls the breadth exceeds the height, whilst the reverse is the\r\n  case in the dolicho-cephalic. Individual exceptions are of course\r\n  not unfrequently met with, more especially among very mixed races,\r\n  such as the modern English; but I am myself acquainted with only\r\n  two dolicho-cephalic _races_, properly so termed, in which the rule\r\n  does not hold good. These are the Tasmanian (not Australian) and\r\n  the Bushman.\r\n\r\n  Any exceptions, therefore, to either rule among ancient and,\r\n  consequently, less mixed races are worthy of being noted.\r\n\r\n  As regards modern brachy-cephalic skulls the law holds almost\r\n  universally, the only marked exception, except in an individual\r\n  here and there, being in two Karén skulls, in which, although both\r\n  decidedly brachy-cephalic, the respective indices stand as ·848 to\r\n  ·924, and as ·790 to ·842.\r\n\r\n  Among priscan brachy-cephalic skulls the most remarkable and\r\n  important exceptions I have met with occur among the neolithic\r\n  crania in the Copenhagen Museum, more than half of which are\r\n  brachy-cephalic, and most of the others nearly so, the mean\r\n  cephalic index of 21 skulls being ·790, whilst the mean altitudinal\r\n  is as high as ·810. In fact, out of 12 skulls whose indices vary\r\n  from ·795 to ·838, no fewer than 10 have the latitudinal index less\r\n  than the altitudinal.\r\n\r\n  The exceptions to the rule as applied to dolicho-cephalic skulls\r\n  also appear to be far more common among the ancient than among the\r\n  modern, excepting the two races I have above referred to.\r\n\r\n  In a long list of ancient and priscan skulls, I find the following\r\n  having the tapino-cephalic character:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------+----------+------------+\r\n  |                                           |  L.

The face was oval and the cheek-bones\r\nwere not prominent. Some of the individuals were characterised by the\r\npeculiar flattening of shin (platycnemism), which probably stood in\r\nrelation to the free action of the foot that was not impeded by the use\r\nof a rigid sole or sandal. This character, however, is neither peculiar\r\nto race, nor to be viewed as a tendency towards the simian type of\r\nleg. These conclusions, which Professor Busk has arrived at from the\r\nexamination of the remains which were submitted to him, have been\r\nfully borne out by the numerous skeletons which have been subsequently\r\ndiscovered, both in the sepulchral caves at Rhosdigre and in a second\r\nchamber in the cairn of Tyddyn Bleiddyn near Cefn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE RANGE OF NEOLITHIC DOLICHO-CEPHALI AND BRACHY-CEPHALI.\r\n\r\n  Relation of Human Remains to those found in Tumuli in Britain.\r\n    --The Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali.--Their Range in\r\n    Britain and Ireland--in France.--The Caverne de l’Homme Mort.\r\n    --The Sepulchral Cave of Orrouy.--The Tumuli.--In Belgium.\r\n    --The Sepulchral Caves of Chauvaux and Sclaigneaux.--The\r\n    Dolicho-cephali of the Iberian Peninsula--Gibraltar--Spain.\r\n    --Cueva de los Murcièlagos.--The Woman’s Cave near Alhama\r\n    in Granada.--The Guanches of the Canary Isles.--Iberic\r\n    Dolicho-cephali of the same race as those of Britain, France, and\r\n    Belgium--Cognate or Identical with the Basque Race.--Evidence\r\n    of History as to the Peoples of Gaul and Spain.--The Basque\r\n    Populations the Oldest.--The Population of Britain.--Basque\r\n    characters in Present Population of Britain and France.--Whence\r\n    came the Basques?--The Celtic and Belgic Brachy-cephali.--The\r\n    Ancient German Race.--General Conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Relation of the Human Remains to those found in British Tumuli._\r\n\r\nBefore we examine the relation of this ancient neolithic race of men to\r\nthose who have left their remains in tumuli and caves in other regions,\r\nit is necessary to define the cranial terminology, as adopted by\r\nProfessors Busk, Huxley, Dr. Thurnam, and other high authorities. The\r\nterm “cephalic index” indicates “the ratio of the extreme transverse to\r\nthe extreme longitudinal diameter of the skull, the latter measurement\r\nbeing taken as unity” (Huxley).\r\n\r\nThe most convenient classification of crania is that adopted by Dr.\r\nThurnam and Professor Huxley,[117] and based on the cephalic index.\r\n\r\n    I. Dolicho-cephali, or long skulls with cephalic index at or below ·73\r\n       Subdolicho-cephali              ”          ”        from ·70 to ·73\r\n   II. Ortho-cephali, or oval skulls                        ”   ·74 to ·79\r\n       Subbrachy-cephali                                    ”   ·77 to ·79\r\n  III. Brachy-cephali or broad skulls                      at or above ·80\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that skull form is of no value in determining\r\nrace, because it varies so much at the present time among the same\r\npeoples, presenting the extremes of dolicho- and brachy-cephalism as\r\nwell as every kind of asymmetry. This, however, is due to our very\r\nabnormal conditions of life, and to the mixture of different races\r\nbrought about by the needs of commerce, as in Manchester and Vienna, as\r\nis pointed out by Mr. Bradley.[118]\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times, neither of these causes of variation made\r\nthemselves seriously felt. There was little, if any, peaceful movement\r\nof races, but war was the normal condition, and society was not\r\nsufficiently advanced to remove man from the influence of his natural\r\nenvironment. The objection may therefore be dismissed as not applicable\r\nto the skulls in question.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which abnormal conditions of life are capable of\r\nmodifying the shape of skulls may be gathered from the comparison of\r\nthe skull of an Irish hog with that of its ancestor the wild-boar, or\r\neven that of a hyæna kept in confinement with that of a wild animal of\r\nthe same species. (See Osteol. Series, Brit. Mus.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The British Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali._\r\n\r\nThe materials for working out the craniology of Europe, in prehistoric\r\ntimes, do not justify any sweeping conclusion as to the distribution\r\nof the various races, but those which Dr. Thurnam (_op. cit._) has\r\ncollected in Britain offer a firm basis for such an inquiry. In the\r\nnumerous long barrows and chambered “gallery graves” of our island,\r\nwhich from the invariable absence of bronze, and the frequent presence\r\nof polished stone implements, may be referred to the neolithic age, the\r\ncrania belong, with scarcely an exception, to the first two of these\r\ndivisions. In the round barrows, on the other hand, in which bronze\r\narticles are found, they belong mainly to the third division, although\r\nsome are ortho-cephalous. Sometimes, as in the case of Tilshead, the\r\ncrania in the primary interment, over which the long barrow was raised,\r\nare long, while those in the secondary, which have been made after the\r\nheaping up of the barrow, are broad.\r\n\r\nOn evidence of this kind Dr. Thurnam concludes, that Britain was\r\ninhabited in the neolithic age by a long-headed people, and that\r\ntowards its close it was invaded by a bronze-using race, who were\r\ndominant during the bronze age. This important conclusion has been\r\nverified by nearly every discovery which has been made in this country\r\nsince its publication. The long skulls graduate into the broad, the\r\noval skulls being the intermediate forms; and this would naturally\r\nresult from the intermingling of the blood of the two races. There\r\nmay, however, have been a tendency towards ortho-cephalism in the\r\ndolicho-cephali, without any admixture of foreign blood, since absolute\r\nunity of form could not be expected.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the primary interment in the barrow of Winterbourne Stoke\r\nis taken by Dr. Thurnam as typical of the dolicho-cephalic class.\r\n“The greatest length is 7·3 inches (the glabello-inial diameter 7·1\r\ninches); the greatest breadth is 5·5 inches, being in the proportion\r\nof 75 to the length taken as 100. The forehead is narrow and receding,\r\nand moderately high in the coronal region, behind which is a trace of\r\ntransverse depression. The parietal tubers are somewhat full, and add\r\nmaterially to the breadth of this otherwise narrow skull. The posterior\r\nborders of the parietals are prolonged backwards, to join a complex\r\nchain of Wormian bones in the line of the lambdoid suture. The superior\r\nscale of the occiput is full, rounded, and prominent; the inion more\r\npronounced than usual in this class of dolicho-cephalic skulls. The\r\nsuperciliaries are well marked, the orbits rather small and long; the\r\nnasals prominent, the facial bones short and small; the molars flat\r\nand almost vertical; the alveolars short, but rather projecting. The\r\nmandible is comparatively small, but angular; the chin square, narrow,\r\nand prominent.”[119]\r\n\r\nDolicho-cephalic skulls in general (and in part ortho-cephalic) are\r\npossessed, according to Dr. Thurnam, of the following characters (Vol.\r\niii. p. 69):--“The supraciliary ridges are less strongly marked than\r\nin the brachy-cephalic. There is none of the prognathism, exaggerated\r\nmalar breadth or great width of the nasal openings, which give such\r\nan air of savageness and ferocity to the New Caledonians and Caroline\r\nIslanders; but the very reverse of all these. They are indeed more\r\northognathic even than many Europeans, and the facial characters\r\ngenerally are mild, and without exaggerated development in any one\r\ndirection.” Their faces are oval. The upper jaw is small, and the\r\nsockets of the incisors and canine almost vertical. The supra-occipital\r\nregion is full and rounded, and there is a post-coronal annular\r\ndepression on the skull, termed by Dr. Gosse “tête annulaire.” The\r\nlength is mainly due to the development of the occiput, a condition\r\nthat is termed by M. Broca “dolicho-cephalie occipitale,” as\r\ndistinguished from the “dolicho-cephalie frontale” of other races.\r\nThe teeth are worn flat. The bones associated with the skulls of this\r\ncharacter show that the stature of the race was short, 5 feet 5 inches\r\nbeing the average height.\r\n\r\nIn the brachy-cephalic, or broad skulls, on the other hand, the\r\nsupraciliary ridges are more strongly marked than in the preceding\r\ngroup; the cheek-bones are high and broad, the sockets for the front\r\nteeth are oblique, and the mouth projects beyond the vertical dropped\r\nfrom the forehead, presenting the character of prognathism. The face,\r\ninstead of being oval, is angular or lozenge-shaped. On the back of\r\nthe head the occipital tuberosity, or probole, is the most prominent\r\nfeature, and there is also generally an occipital flattening, which may\r\nhave been caused by the use of an unyielding cradle-board in infancy.\r\nThe entire maxillary apparatus is so largely developed, that the\r\nterm “macrognathic,” introduced by Professor Huxley, is particularly\r\napplicable to them. The “type mongoloide” of Dr. Pruner-Bey is closely\r\nallied to, if not identical with, this form of skull.\r\n\r\nThe stature of the British brachy-cephali is much greater than that of\r\nthe dolicho-cephali, the average for the adult male being 5 feet 8·4\r\ninches, according to Dr. Thurnam.\r\n\r\nThe human remains from the caves and chambered-tombs of Denbighshire\r\nbelong to the first of these divisions, in the possession of every one\r\nof the characters assigned to it by Dr. Thurnam, although the crania\r\nbelong to the ortho-cephalous portion of the series, that is, tending\r\ntowards broad-headedness. It may therefore be inferred that they belong\r\nto the same race as the neolithic raisers of the long-barrows, a race\r\nwhich we shall presently see to be identical with the ancient Iberians\r\nand modern Basques.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Range of the Dolicho-cephali in Britain and Ireland._\r\n\r\nThe same class of human remains has been obtained from caves in other\r\ndistricts in Great Britain. In the Oxford Museum a human skull, from\r\nthe cave of Llandebie, possesses cephalic index of ·72; while a second,\r\nfrom the cave of Uphill in Somersetshire, explored by Mr. James Parker\r\nin 1863, measures ·723. (See p. 197.) The latter was associated with\r\nrude pottery, charcoal, and the remains of the following animals: the\r\nwild-cat, dog, fox, badger, pig, stag, _Bos longifrons_, goat, and\r\nwater-rat. Most of the remains belong to young individuals, and some\r\nhave been gnawed by dogs, wolves, or foxes.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire a human femur presenting an enormous development of\r\nthe linea aspera, which implies the possession of the platycnemic\r\ncharacter, has been met with in a cave in King’s Scar, near Settle (see\r\np. 113), and fragments of a long skull are preserved in the Museum at\r\nLeeds from that of Dowkerbottom.\r\n\r\nProfessor Turner has described[120] the remains found in a cave in\r\nthe Old Red sandstone on the shore of the bay of Oban in 1869 by Mr.\r\nMackay. There were two human skeletons, along with the broken and burnt\r\nbones of the roe and stag, limpet-shells, flint nodules, and flint\r\nflakes. One of the leg-bones is platycnemic, and the fragments of skull\r\nmay probably be referred to the dolicho-cephalic type.\r\n\r\nThe same type of skull has also been obtained by the Rev. Canon\r\nGreenwell, from the neolithic tumuli of Yorkshire, along with the\r\nsame group of animals as in the caves at Perthi-Chwareu, the _Bos\r\nlongifrons_, goat, horse, dog, and stag; and Professor Rolleston,\r\nF.R.S., informs me that some of the associated human leg-bones are\r\nplatycnemic. It is also recognized by Professor Huxley as identical\r\nwith his river-bed type of skulls from alluvial deposits near Muskham\r\nin the valley of the Trent, Ledbury Hall in the valley of the Dove, and\r\nin Ireland from the bed of the Nore in Queen’s County, and from that\r\nof the river Blackwater. To it also Professor Huxley refers[121] five\r\nor six out of the seven skulls obtained by Mr. Laing from the stone\r\ncists in the burial mound at Keiss in Caithness, and associated with\r\nrude weapons and implements of bone and stone. They probably belonged\r\nto the inhabitants of the neighbouring burgh, or circular stone\r\ndwelling, in and around which were the broken bones of the following\r\nanimal remains: the _Bos longifrons_, goat, stag, hog, horse, dog, fox,\r\ngrampus or small whale, dolphin or some other small cetacean, great auk\r\n(_Alca impennis_, now extinct in Europe), lesser auk, cormorant, shag,\r\nsolan goose, cod, lobster, and shell-fish. A lower jaw also of a child,\r\nbroken after the same manner as other refuse bones, is considered by\r\nProfessor Owen and Mr. Laing to prove that human flesh was sometimes\r\nused for food. The reindeer was living in the district at this time,\r\nsince its remains have been identified by Dr. Campbell from the Harbour\r\nmound, one of the many refuse-heaps in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe same kind of skull is also described by Professor Wilson under\r\nthe name of “boat-shaped” or “kumbe-cephalic,” from the ancient stone\r\nchambers and tumuli of Scotland.[122]\r\n\r\nIn the Table on the next page, showing the relative size and shape of\r\nthe more important long skulls of Britain and Ireland, it will be seen\r\nthat the extreme long-headedness of those from the long barrows is not\r\npossessed by those either of the caves and tombs of Denbighshire or of\r\nthe river-bed type of Huxley, represented by the skulls from Muskham,\r\nLedbury, Blackwater (Ireland), and Keiss.\r\n\r\nThe greater breadth of the skulls from the caves and tombs of\r\nDenbighshire, as compared with those of the typical long skulls\r\nfrom the long barrows, may possibly be due to a mixture with the\r\nbroad-headed race. In that case, however, none of the tallness, or\r\nprognathism, of the latter has been handed down. It is most probably a\r\nmere variation within the limits of one race, and is unaccompanied by\r\nthe fusion of dolicho-cephalic with brachy-cephalic characters, such\r\nas M. Broca and Dr. Thurnam have observed in the skulls from tombs and\r\ncaves in France.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+------+\r\n  |                                      |       |        |       |        |Latitud.|      |\r\n  |                SKULLS.               |Length.|Breadth.|Height.|Circum- |or Ceph.| Alt. |\r\n  |                                      |       |        |       |ference.| Index. |Index.|\r\n  +--------------------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+------+\r\n  |Mean of 48 males, Brit., Thurnam,     |  7·7  |  5·5   |  5·62 |  21·3  |  ·715  | ·730 |\r\n  |  long barrows                        |       |        |       |        |        |      |\r\n  |Mean of 19 females, Brit., Thurnam    |  7·45 |  5·3   |  5·3  |  20·6  |  ·710  | ·730 |\r\n  |  long barrows                        |       |        |       |        |        |      |\r\n  |Mean of 10 skulls, Perthi-Chwareu Cave|  7·07 |  5·5   |  5·6  |  20·0  |  ·765  |   -- |\r\n  |Skull from Llandebie Cave             |  7·3  |  5·3   |   --  |   --   |  ·720  |   -- |\r\n  |    ”      Uphill                     |  7·36 |  5·43  |   --  |   --   |  ·723  |   -- |\r\n  |Mean of 6 skulls from Keiss.

They were farmers and shepherds, and in this country\r\nin the neolithic stage of culture. In the solitary case offered by the\r\nHarbour mound at Keiss they were cannibals.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Range of the Brachy-cephali._\r\n\r\nNo human remains of the brachy-cephalic, or broad type, as defined\r\nby Dr. Thurnam have been obtained from the caves in Britain. The\r\nevidence, however, is decisive that, in the Bronze age, a tall,\r\nround-headed, rugged-featured race occupied all those parts of Britain\r\nand Ireland that were worth conquering, and drove away to the west or\r\nabsorbed the smaller neolithic inhabitants. And the identity of their\r\nskull-form, in the series of interments in the round and bowl-shaped\r\nbarrows, extending from the Bronze age down to the date of the Roman\r\noccupation of Britain, shows that, both in the North and the South,\r\nthis large-sized coarse-featured people was in possession at the time\r\nof the Roman conquest.\r\n\r\nThe size and shape of the typical broad crania may be gathered from the\r\nfirst two columns of the following Table, which is an abstract of those\r\npublished by Dr. Thurnam in “Crania Britannica,” and the “Memoirs of\r\nthe Anthropological Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measurements of British Brachy-cephali, and Gaulish and Belgic\r\nBrachy-cephali and Dolicho-cephali._\r\n\r\n  Column-heading Key:\r\n  A Date.[B]\r\n  B Length.\r\n  C Breadth.\r\n  D Height.\r\n  E Circumference.\r\n  F Latitudinal or Cephalic index.\r\n  G Altitudinal index.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------+-------+----+-----+----+----+------+-----+\r\n  |                SKULL.               |   A   |  B |  C  |  D |  E |  F   |  G  |\r\n  +-------------------------------------+-------+----+-----+----+----+------+-----+\r\n  |                                     |       |    |     |    |    |      |     |\r\n  |TYPICAL BROAD SKULLS.--BRITAIN.      |       |    |     |    |    |      |     |\r\n  | Mean of 56 males, Brit.

Broca and Dr. Thurnam into the caves and tombs of\r\nFrance prove that the small dolicho-cephali and the tall brachy-cephali\r\nlived in that country in the neolithic age. We are indebted to the\r\nformer for a most important account of the Caverne de l’Homme Mort,\r\nwhich reproduces all the essential points which we have observed in the\r\nsepulchral caves of Denbighshire.\r\n\r\nThe Caverne de l’Homme Mort[124] is situated in a lonely ravine that\r\npenetrates the wild limestone plateau, in the south-west of the\r\ndepartment of Lozère, near the hamlet of Vialle, in the commune of St.\r\nPierre des Tripiés. It was discovered by the peasants, and its contents\r\nwere partially disturbed by their search after hidden treasure before\r\nit was explored by Dr. Prunières. In front of the cave was a platform,\r\ncomposed of earth mingled with fragments of charcoal, forming a layer\r\nabout forty centimetres thick, in which were the stones of seven\r\nhearths, flint-flakes and scrapers, lance-heads, broken bones of the\r\nhare, fallow-deer, roe, pig (or wild-boar). All the flints were worked,\r\nand one lance-head had been chipped out of the stump of a celt and\r\npresented portions of the polished surface, thus fixing the neolithic\r\nage of the accumulation. Coarse pottery was also met with.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the hare were very abundant, and proved that there was no\r\nprejudice against the use of its flesh. In the caves of Perthi-Chwareu\r\nwe have also seen that this was the case.\r\n\r\nThe refuse-heaps ceased abruptly at the entrance of the cave, at\r\na point where the traces of a wall, composed of large stones, was\r\nvisible. Immediately behind this were human bones, in a thick layer\r\nof dry sand, scattered about in the wildest confusion, which was\r\nprobably the result of successive interments, as well as of subsequent\r\ndisturbance by burrowing animals and treasure-seekers. Two bone-points\r\nand a flint arrow-head were the only implements discovered within the\r\nsepulchral chamber.\r\n\r\nTwo small human bones, bearing undoubted marks of having been burnt,\r\nwere discovered in the refuse-heap; but they do not, as M. Broca justly\r\nobserves, imply the practice of cannibalism, since they may have fallen\r\nout of the burial-place, and subsequently have come into contact with\r\nthe fire on one of the hearths.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to estimate the number of interments in this cave.\r\nExclusive of the many skulls which have been destroyed or lost, M.\r\nPrunières obtained nineteen very nearly perfect, which are described by\r\nM. Broca as seven male, six female, three of uncertain sex, and three\r\nchildren. They are remarkable for the softness of their contours, the\r\ndelicacy of their features, and the orthognathism of their faces. The\r\nforehead is wide and high, and the vertex and the occipital region of\r\nthe skull well rounded. The cephalic index varies between ·680 and ·78,\r\nthe mean of the whole series being ·732.\r\n\r\nM. Broca remarks, that these crania contrast strongly with those of\r\nthe present broad-headed inhabitants of the district, and that they\r\ndiffer from those found in the dolmens by M. Prunières in their greater\r\nlength, in the smallness of their features, and the weakness of their\r\nmuscular impressions. The study of the bones of the skeleton confirms\r\nthese differences. The men who buried their dead in the Caverne de\r\nl’Homme Mort were smaller than the dolmen builders, their bones were\r\nmore slender, and they were altogether a less muscular race. They are\r\nconsidered by M. Broca to represent the neolithic aborigines; and\r\nif his description and measurements be compared with those of the\r\ndolicho-cephali of Britain, given by Dr. Thurnam (p. 191 _et seq._),\r\nit will be seen that they are identical with the latter, which is the\r\noldest race yet known to have occupied Great Britain since the close of\r\nthe pleistocene period.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from the sepulchral cave, and in the same ravine,\r\nM. Broca explored a large cavern, which had been occupied, probably by\r\nthe same people, since the same kind of instruments were discovered as\r\nin the refuse-heap. So that we have here, side by side, the abode and\r\nthe sepulchre of the same ancient tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Sepulchral Cave of Orrouy._\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral cave of Orrouy (Oise) described by M. Broca, in which\r\nthe remains of about fifty individuals were interred, furnished both\r\ntypes of skull, united, according to Dr. Thurnam and M. Broca,[125] by\r\na series of intermediate forms, that prove a fusion of blood between\r\nthe broad- and the long-headed peoples. On referring to the preceding\r\nTable (p. 199) it will be seen that the cephalic index varies from\r\n·75 to ·88. Eight out of the series of twenty-one skulls united the\r\ncharacteristic dolicho-cephalous fore-head with the brachy-cephalous\r\nmiddle and hind-head. “We have here,” writes Dr. Thurnam, “a veritable\r\nhybrid form of cranium, resulting from the mixture or crossing, under\r\ncertain circumstances unknown to us, of a dolicho-cephalous with a\r\nbrachy-cephalous race.”\r\n\r\n“... In the Orrouy skulls of hybrid form, two encephalic\r\ngrowth-tendencies appear to me distinguishable; one, the longitudinal\r\nor fronto-occipital; the other a transverse, or bi-parietal and\r\ntemporal one. Now the remarkable supramastoid depressions, visible\r\nin the hindhead of these skulls, seem to be well explained by the\r\nidea of an intersection or crossing of these two tendencies in the\r\nbrain-growth; corresponding, as they must have done, to the angles\r\nformed by the posterior surfaces of the middle, the lower surfaces\r\nof the posterior and temporal lobes of the cerebrum, and the upper\r\nsurface of the cerebellum.”[126]\r\n\r\nIn eight out of thirty-four humeri the fossa of the olecranon is\r\nperforated.\r\n\r\nThe human remains occurred in the same confusion as at Perthi-Chwareu,\r\nand were associated with fragments of coarse pottery, flint flakes, and\r\nbones of ruminants. The occurrence of polished stone celts indicates\r\nthe neolithic age of the interment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skulls from French Tumuli._\r\n\r\nBoth long and broad skulls also occur in the chambered tombs of France,\r\nalthough the latter by far predominate. Those from the Long Barrow at\r\nChamant are dolicho-cephalic and ortho-cephalic, with cephalic index\r\nranging from ·71 to ·78 (Broca), and other similar cases are quoted by\r\nDr. Thurnam from Noyelles-sur-Mer, Fontenay, and other tumuli. In the\r\nlarge sepulchral chamber at Meudon, that contained 200 skeletons, the\r\nmajority of the skulls were brachy-cephalic, although twenty of them\r\nwere of the ortho-cephalic type. This mixture may be accounted for,\r\nmost probably, by the two races, which are clearly defined from each\r\nother in Britain, being intermingled in France.\r\n\r\nDr. Thurnam, summing up the whole evidence as regards the distribution\r\nof races in the tombs of Gaul, concludes that the two races came\r\ninto contact in Gaul at an earlier period in the neolithic age than\r\nin Britain. And this must necessarily have been the case from the\r\ngeographical position of our island, which could only be invaded, in\r\nthose times, by the races in possession of the contiguous mainland of\r\nFrance and Belgium. Both these regions must have been conquered before\r\nan invasion could have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dolicho-cephali of the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar._\r\n\r\nThe researches carried on from 1863 to 1868, by Captain Brome, aided by\r\nDr. Falconer and Professor Busk,[127] into the caves of Gibraltar, have\r\nresulted in the proof that, in the neolithic age, that barren rock was\r\ninhabited by a race of men identical with that which is found in the\r\nlong barrows and caves of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the military prison on the top of Windmill Hill\r\nrevealed the existence of a deep fissure, containing dark earth,\r\nmingled with charcoal and broken bones, which led into a series of\r\nchambers. The upper of these is described by Captain Brome as being\r\ncompletely choked up to the roof with earth, charcoal, and decomposed\r\nbones of mammals, birds, and fishes, flint flakes, and pottery. Below\r\nwere two floors of stalagmite, filled with loose stones and earth,\r\nthrough which a shaft penetrated into a fissure at a lower level,\r\nleading into a lower chamber that had a free communication with the\r\nsurface, since the current of air was so strong as to extinguish the\r\nlamps. In this also human remains and works of art were met with. The\r\npassages were very complicated, and in some of them a red breccia\r\ncontained the remains of the pleistocene mammals, the spotted hyæna,\r\nthe _Rhinoceros hemitœchus_, and others. This series of passages and\r\nchambers is described by Captain Brome and Professor Busk as “Genista\r\nCave No. 1.”\r\n\r\nA second, or “Genista, No. 2,” was discovered by Captain Brome opening\r\non the surface near the West Cliff, with its floor covered with\r\nstalagmite, under which was the same class of remains as that above\r\nmentioned. Subsequently a third and fourth, “Genista, 3 and 4,” were\r\nexplored with the same results, of which the latter, opening on the\r\nface of a vertical cliff 40 feet below the summit, from its difficulty\r\nof access must have been used as a place of refuge rather than of\r\nhabitation or burial. With this exception, the whole group of Genista\r\nCaves contained human bones, resting in the greatest confusion, and\r\nproving that since the bodies had been interred the contents had been\r\ndisturbed, either by the burrowing of animals or by the action of\r\nwater, pools of which were present in some of the chambers. Evidence of\r\nthe former presence of water was to be seen in the sheets of stalagmite\r\non most of the floors. The same confusion would result, as is suggested\r\nby Professor Busk, by interments at successive times. The intimate\r\nassociation of the fractured bones of the animals, and the charcoal,\r\nbroken pottery, and other traces of occupation, with the human bones,\r\nmay be accounted for in the same manner as the similar mixture of\r\nremains in the caves of Denbighshire. If the caves had been inhabited\r\nat one time, and subsequently set apart for burials, the human bones\r\nwould become intermingled with the accumulation of refuse on the floors\r\nby the causes above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the animals associated with the human remains belong,\r\naccording to Professor Busk, to the domestic ox of various sizes,\r\ngoat, ibex, hog, arvicola, hare, rabbit, badger, dog, and a species\r\nof phocæna, fish, birds, and marine and land molluscs. The pottery is\r\nfor the most part hand-made, coarse and imperfectly burnt; and the\r\nvessels in some cases had singular perforated spouts, similar to those\r\nstill in use by the Kabyles of Algeria, and some of the Berber tribes.\r\nSome of it, however, is of a fine red ware turned in the lathe, and\r\nprobably introduced at a later period, even, as remarked by Mr. Franks,\r\nafter the Roman occupation of Spain, to which he refers a bronze\r\nfish-hook, the only metallic article found in the group of caves. The\r\nimplements of bone consist of a needle, and rounded pins and spikes.\r\nOne cannon-bone of a small ox bears marks of sharp cuts with an edge of\r\nmetal, inflicted probably, as Professor Busk suggests, “in an attempt\r\nto hamstring the animal, as is sometimes done at the present day in\r\nthe Spanish bull-ring.” It may possibly be more modern than the stone\r\nimplements found in the same cave.\r\n\r\nThe associated stone articles are celts of polished greenstone,\r\nsimilar to that found in the neolithic cave at Perthi-Chwareu (Fig.\r\n38), flakes, a greenstone chisel, querns and rubbing-stones, a\r\nwhetstone perforated for suspension, and a fragment of an armlet made\r\nof alabaster. A small lump of coarse plumbago may have been used for\r\npersonal ornament.\r\n\r\nThe human remains examined by Professor Busk belonged to a large number\r\nof individuals of all ages, and are for the most part in a fragmentary\r\ncondition. Some of the thigh-bones are carinate, and remarkable for the\r\nenormous development of the _linea aspera_ and the thickness of their\r\nwalls (Fig. 57), the medullary cavity being reduced to a small size,\r\nas in those figured from the tumulus at Cefn. Some of the tibiæ are\r\nplatycnemic, presenting the peculiar lateral flattening which first\r\nattracted the attention of Dr. Falconer and Professor Busk (Figs. 49,\r\n50, and 51), but which M. Broca has since determined in the tumuli\r\nand caves of France, and I have discovered in those of Denbighshire\r\n(p. 177).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 62, 63, 64.--Cranium from Genista Cave (Busk).]\r\n\r\nThe only two crania sufficiently perfect to allow of a comparison being\r\nmade, from Genista Cave No. 3, are perfectly symmetrical, and belong to\r\na high type (Figs. 62, 63, and 64). “They are dolicho-cephalic, quite\r\northognathous, and wholly aphanozygous. In one the frontal sinuses are\r\nconsiderably more developed than they are in the other, but in neither\r\nis there any thickening of the supra-orbital border” (Busk). The\r\nteeth are worn flat. They both belonged to men in the prime of life.\r\nA third skull, from Genista Cave No. 1, belongs to the same type. The\r\nmeasurements of the two most perfect skulls are given in the same table\r\nas those from North Wales (p. 171).\r\n\r\nGibraltar has also been occupied in ancient times by broad-headed\r\nmen, similar, in M. Broca’s opinion, to those interred in the cave of\r\nOrrouy. In 1864 human bones, together with a skull (for measurements\r\nsee p. 199), were dug out of the Judge’s Cave by Sir James Cochrane.\r\nThe tibiæ are platycnemic, and the skull is described by Professor Busk\r\nas being “perfectly symmetrical, brachy-cephalic, slightly prognathous,\r\nbut with vertical teeth, aphanozygous. The forehead is well arched, and\r\nthe supra-orbital border slightly elevated, the orbits being square,\r\nand the nasal opening elongated and pyriform.” The cephalic index is\r\n·792. The age of these skeletons is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spain.--Cueva de los Murcièlagos._\r\n\r\nProfessor Busk[128] calls attention to the fact, that a long skull\r\nsimilar to that from Gibraltar has been found in Spain, in an ancient\r\ncopper-mine of the Asturias, together with hammers made of antler,\r\nand that it bears “the closest possible resemblance” to the Basque\r\nskulls, described by M. Broca, from Guipuscoa on the Spanish and St.\r\nJean de Luz on the French side of the Pyrenees. He points out, also,\r\nthe resemblance which exists between the crania figured by Don Gongora\r\ny Martinez, from the caverns and dolmens of Andalusia and those under\r\nconsideration; finally arriving at the conclusion that “a pretty\r\nuniform priscan race at one time pervaded the peninsula from one end to\r\nthe other, and that this race is at the present day represented by, at\r\nany rate, a part of the population now inhabiting the Basque provinces.”\r\n\r\nIn the work of Don Manuel Gongora y Martinez[129] referred to, there is\r\na most interesting account of the prehistoric antiquities of Andalusia.\r\nSeveral interments are described in the Cueva de los Murcièlagos, a\r\ncave running into the limestone rock, out of which the grand scenery\r\nof the southern part of the Sierra Nevada has been, to a great extent,\r\ncarved. In one spot, a group of three skeletons was met with, one of\r\nwhich was adorned with a plain coronet of gold, and clad in a tunic\r\nmade of esparto-grass, finely plaited, so as to form a pattern which\r\nresembles some of the designs on gold ornaments from Etruscan tombs.\r\nAt a spot further within, a second group of twelve skeletons lay in\r\na semicircle, around one considered by Don Manuel to have belonged\r\nto a woman, covered with a tunic of skin, and wearing a necklace of\r\nesparto-grass, a marine shell pierced for suspension, the carved tusk\r\nof a wild boar, and earrings of black stone. There were other articles\r\nof plaited esparto-grass, such as baskets and sandals; flint flakes,\r\npieces of a white marble armlet, polished axes of the type of fig. 38,\r\nbone awls, and a wooden spoon, together with pottery of the same type\r\nas that from Gibraltar, fragments of charcoal, and bones of animals.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in this cave, there were no traces of metal, except gold, in\r\na second, in the same neighbourhood, similar interments were met with\r\nin association with copper (bronze) implements, and with pottery of the\r\nsame kind.\r\n\r\nThese interments in caves are of the same order as those from\r\nGibraltar; and since the skulls agree with those from the latter, there\r\ncan be little doubt but that, in the neolithic age, the long-headed\r\nsmall race under discussion had possession of the southern provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Woman’s Cave, near Alhama._\r\n\r\nThis conclusion derives additional support from the discoveries\r\nsubsequently made by Mr. McPherson[130] in the Woman’s Cave, near\r\nAlhama, in Grenada, of implements of bone, flint, and greenstone of the\r\nneolithic age, mingled with charcoal, pottery, and human skeletons of\r\nthe same type as those from Gibraltar. The human skull, figured by Mr.\r\nMcPherson, is dolicho-cephalic, and the thigh-bone is remarkable for\r\nthe extreme development of the _linea aspera_, which assumes the form\r\nof a stout ridge sweeping from one extremity of the shaft to the other.\r\n\r\nThis long-headed race, burying their dead in caves, also erected\r\ndolmens in Andalusia. In the dolmen of De los Eriales[131] human\r\nremains were discovered along with bronze (copper?) lance-heads, and\r\npottery of the same sort as that of the caves. It is, therefore,\r\nevident that the practice of burial in caves, and of erecting dolmens,\r\nwas carried on by the same people in Britain, in France, and in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Guanches of the Canary Isles._\r\n\r\nThe Guanches,[132] the ancient inhabitants of the Canary Isles, are\r\nconsidered by Berthollet, Glas, and other high authorities, to be\r\nallied to the Berbers of North Africa in language. At the time of\r\ntheir discovery and conquest by the Spaniards, they are described by\r\nMiss Haigh as being unacquainted with the use of any metal, and as\r\nfashioning their weapons out of a black, hard stone. The Guanches of\r\nTeneriffe lived principally in caves, preferring for their winter\r\nresidence those near the coast, and “in the summer those in the\r\nhigher parts in the interior of the island, whence they could enjoy\r\nthe fresh air of the hills.” Some of these caves have been excavated\r\nby the hand of man, and are divided into square chambers, containing\r\nrock-hewn benches, “and deep niches made to contain vessels of milk\r\nor water.” They had also stone houses, thatched with straw or fern.\r\nThey also buried their dead in sepulchral caves, belonging each to a\r\nfamily or clan, entrances to which are carefully concealed, and are\r\nnow discovered only by accident. In them the dead were placed either\r\nupright, or lying side by side on wooden scaffolds, after having been\r\nprepared with salt and butter and thoroughly dried and wrapped in the\r\ntanned skins of sheep or goat. In some cases the prepared body was\r\nplaced in the sitting posture.\r\n\r\nThey were possessed of a settled government by “Menceys,” or chiefs\r\nsubordinate to one head, and were divided into “nobles and common\r\npeople, and had a code of punishment for the robber, murderer, and\r\nadulterer.”\r\n\r\nTheir food consisted of sheep and goats, roasted barley ground between\r\ntwo stones, and the fruit of the arbutus, date-palm and fig, as well\r\nas fish and rabbits. Their fences were made of reed, their ropes and\r\nnets of rushes, and their baskets, mats, and bags, of palm-leaves. They\r\nmanufactured vessels out of clay or hard wood, needles of fishbones,\r\nbeads of clay, and they especially excelled in the art of tanning. The\r\ncivilization of this very interesting people may fairly be taken to\r\nbe a fragment of that of North Africa and of Europe in the neolithic\r\nage, protected by insulation from the influences by which it was swept\r\naway from the countries bordering on the shores of the Mediterranean,\r\njust as the old Norse customs and legends are preserved by the present\r\ninhabitants of Iceland in greater purity than in Norway.\r\n\r\nThe Berbers are viewed by Professor Busk as of the same non-Aryan stock\r\nas the Basque, and the civilization of the Guanches may therefore be\r\ntaken to represent that of the Iberic peoples of Spain, among whom\r\ncaves were used in like manner for habitation and burial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iberic Dolicho-cephali of the same Race as those of Britain._\r\n\r\nIf this group of Iberic skulls be compared with those from the caves\r\nand tumuli of Great Britain (see Table, p. 197 and that below) it will\r\nbe seen, that what Professor Busk observes of the ancient population of\r\nSpain is equally true of that of our country in the neolithic age. And\r\nthe identity of form is especially remarkable in the crania from the\r\nsepulchral caves at Perthi-Chwareu, the difference between them being\r\nso small as to be of little account:--\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+------+\r\n  |                         |       |        |       |Circum- |Ceph. |\r\n  |                         |Length.| Brdth. |Height.|ference.|index.|\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+------+\r\n  |                         |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |Mean of 10 skulls from   |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  Perthi-Chwareu         |  7·07 |  5·5   |  5·6  |  20·0  | ·765 |\r\n  |Mean of 2 skulls from    |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  Genista Cave, No. 3    |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  (Busk)                 |  7·35 |  5·55  |  5·9  |  20·7  | ·755 |\r\n  |Mean of 40 male Basque   |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  skulls from Guipuscoa  |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  (Thurnam)              |  7·2  |  5·5   |  5·4  |    --  | ·760 |\r\n  |Mean of 20 female, ditto |  6·9  |  5·3   |  5·0  |    --  | ·760 |\r\n  |Mean of 19 skulls,       |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  chiefly male           |  7·4  |  5·6   |  5·4  |    --  | ·760 |\r\n  |Mean of 57 female ditto, |       |        |       |        |      |\r\n  |  St. Jean de Luz        |  7·02 |  5·6   |   --  |    --  | ·799 |\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Dolicho-cephali cognate with the Basque._\r\n\r\nNor can the truth of Professor Busk’s conclusion, that the group of\r\nskulls in question belong to a people akin in blood to the modern\r\nBasques, be disputed. We are indebted to M. Broca[133] for the\r\nelaborate description of seventy-eight Basque crania from a village\r\ncemetery in Guipuscoa, and of fifty-eight from an ossuary at St. Jean\r\nde Luz, in which they had been collected in the reign of Francis I.,\r\n1532. In both these groups the long and oval types predominated, the\r\nbroad type being represented by 6·4 (Thurnam) per cent. in the one, and\r\n37·36 per cent. (Broca) in the other; a difference that is doubtless\r\ncaused by the greater mixture of blood in the south-west of France\r\nthan in the north-west of Spain, shut off from the broad-headed Gallic\r\ntribes by the Pyrenees.[134] Six skulls, obtained by Professor Virchow\r\nfrom Bilbao, agree in all particulars with those from Guipuscoa. M.\r\nBroca has further shown, that this group of Spanish skulls offers\r\nall the characters of the black-haired, swarthy, oval-faced, Basque\r\npopulation of the surrounding region, and it therefore follows, that\r\nthey may be taken as standards of comparison, as typical of the ancient\r\nBasque crania, modified, it may be, to some extent, by the infusion of\r\nother blood. Their agreement, therefore, with the skulls from Gibraltar\r\nimplies that the latter are also Basque. And since they agree also with\r\nthose from the cave of Perthi-Chwareu, as may be seen in the preceding\r\nTable, the men who buried their dead in the caves of North Wales in the\r\nneolithic age, are proved to belong to the same stock.\r\n\r\nThe same long-headed, small race also inhabited France, side by side\r\nwith the broad-headed Gallic tribes; and since to it belong the\r\nskeletons in the Cave de l’Homme Mort, which M. Broca refers to the\r\nneolithic aborigines, it may reasonably be concluded that in Gaul, as\r\nin Britain, it was the older of the two races. The two have also been\r\nmet with in the caves of Belgium. If we allow that an aboriginal Basque\r\npopulation spread over the whole of Britain, France, and Belgium, and\r\nthat it was subsequently dispossessed by broad-headed invaders, the two\r\nextremes of skull-form and of stature, and of the gradations between\r\nthem, may be satisfactorily explained. And this view coincides with the\r\nwell-ascertained facts of history.\r\n\r\nDr. Thurnam was the first to recognize that the long skulls, out of\r\nthe long barrows of Britain and Ireland, were of the Basque or Iberian\r\ntype, and Professor Huxley holds that the river-bed skulls belong to\r\nthe same race.[135] (Compare Table p. 197 with the preceding.) We have\r\ntherefore proof, that an Iberian or Basque population spread over the\r\nwhole of Britain and Ireland in the neolithic age, inhabiting caves,\r\nand burying their dead in caves and chambered tombs, just as in the\r\nIberian Peninsula also in the neolithic age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dolicho-cephali and Brachy-cephali in Neolithic Caves of\r\nBelgium.--Chauvaux._\r\n\r\nBoth these forms of skull have been met with in Belgium, the one in the\r\nfamous cave of Chauvaux, the other in that of Sclaigneaux.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is a rock-shelter passing into a small cave, at the\r\nbase of the limestone cliff on the Meuse, opposite the little village\r\nof Rivière, between Dinant and Namur. It was known to contain human\r\nremains in 1837-8, and was partially explored in 1842 by Dr. Spring,\r\nwho published his account of the discoveries in 1853, and subsequently\r\nin 1864 and 1866. Below a thin layer of loam was a floor of stalagmite,\r\nconcealing a vast number of broken human bones mixed pêle-mêle with\r\nthose of wild and domestic animals, and associated with charcoal and\r\ncoarse pottery. Two polished stone celts indicated the neolithic age\r\nof the accumulation; one of them resting close to a skull which had\r\nbeen fractured by a blow from a blunt instrument, such as it may have\r\ninflicted. The human bones belonged to infants and young adults.\r\n\r\nFrom the fractured and burnt bones of the animals it is clear that\r\nthey had been accumulated in the cave daring the time that it was\r\ninhabited by man. Dr. Spring[136] inferred that the broken human bones\r\nproved that human beings, as well as the animals, formed the food of\r\nthe cave-dwellers, and further, since all the human remains belong to\r\nyoung individuals, that the cannibalism was not accidental, or caused\r\nby famine, but the result of a deliberate selection.\r\n\r\nThe facts which induced Dr. Spring to come to this conclusion are\r\ninterpreted by M. Dupont[137] in a different manner. He holds, that the\r\nproportion of young individuals is not greater in Chauvaux than that\r\nwhich he has observed in other sepulchral caves in Belgium, and that\r\nthere is nothing which forbids the supposition that this also was used\r\nas a place of interment. The human bones may have been broken by the\r\nfoxes and badgers, which are so abundant in the district, and have been\r\nmixed, by their continual burrowing, with the remains of the animals in\r\nthe old refuse-heap accumulated on the floor during the habitation of\r\nman. Such a mixture of remains we have already observed in the caves\r\nof North Wales and Gibraltar. The recent researches of M. Soreil[138]\r\nleave no room for doubting the truth of M. Dupont’s interpretation.\r\nTwo perfect human skeletons were discovered along with flint flakes,\r\npottery, a barbed arrow-head, and many scattered human bones not\r\nbroken by design, while the long bones of the associated animals bore\r\nunmistakeable traces of having been split for the sake of the marrow.\r\nOn one long bone, for example, of the ox, there were cuts made by a\r\nflint implement, as well as the mark of the blow by which it had been\r\nsplit longitudinally; and another ox-bone, and the canine of a boar,\r\nbore marks of burning. The bones of the animals were very abundant,\r\nand belonged to the following species: beaver, hamster, and other\r\nsmall rodents, hare, badger, fox, boar, stag, roe, ox, and goat. In\r\nthis case, as in the caves of Perthi-Chwareu, and of l’Homme Mort, the\r\ninhabitants had used the hare for food, as well as the other animals,\r\nand did not share the prejudice against the use of its flesh for food,\r\nwhich Cæsar remarks of the inhabitants of Britain (Comm. 1, xii.).\r\n\r\nThe cave must, therefore, be viewed as a place of sepulture for a\r\nneolithic people, whose implements abound in the neighbourhood, and not\r\nas having been inhabited by a race of cannibals.\r\n\r\nThe bodies had been interred in the crouching posture, with their\r\nthighs bent, their heads resting on their arms, and their faces turned\r\ntowards the valley. They rested side by side in two small holes, which\r\nhad been dug in the deposit containing the bones of the animals, and\r\nthe skeletons were cemented to the rock by stalagmite, and surrounded\r\nby large stones. They belonged to individuals far past the prime of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBoth skulls were dolicho-cephalic, and the most perfect of them is\r\ndescribed by Professor Virchow as presenting a parietal flattening,\r\nwhich is probably analogous to the “tête annulaire,” so commonly\r\npresent in the long skulls of the neolithic age. It possesses a\r\ncephalic index of ·72 (·718 Virchow). The sutures in both the skulls\r\nwere very nearly obliterated. The measurements are given in the Table\r\nin page 199.\r\n\r\nThe crania, in all these characters, are to be classified with the\r\nlong skulls from the caves and chambered tombs of France, Britain,\r\nand Spain. They belong to people in the same stage of culture, and\r\npractising the same mode of burial in a crouching posture. Chauvaux\r\nis the furthest cave to the east on the continent of Europe, in which\r\ntraces of this long-headed race have been observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Sclaigneaux._\r\n\r\nThe cave of Sclaigneaux,[139] explored by M. Arnould, near the hamlet\r\nof that name, fourteen miles from Namur, has been proved to contain\r\nhuman bones, lying mixed with those of the animals in the refuse-heap\r\non the floor, as in the cave of Chauvaux. The animals belonged to\r\nexisting species:--\r\n\r\n    Hedgehog.\r\n    Badger.\r\n    Beech-marten.\r\n    Weazel.\r\n    Fox.\r\n    Dog.\r\n    Wild Cat.\r\n    Hare.\r\n    Rabbit.\r\n    Ox.\r\n    Goat.\r\n    Stag.\r\n    Boar.\r\n    Horse.\r\n    Rodents.\r\n\r\nBones of birds, frogs, and fishes were also met with. Intermingled\r\nwith these were human skeletons, disposed in a rude sort of order,\r\nand belonging to bodies which had been interred at different times.\r\nFrom the lower jaws M. Arnould calculates that the number of bodies\r\ninterred was not less than sixty-two, of which twelve belonged to aged\r\nindividuals, twenty-one to those in the prime of life, sixteen to young\r\nadults, and thirteen to children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 65, 66.--Skull from Cave of Sclaigneaux.\r\n(Arnould.)]\r\n\r\nThe crania (Figs. 65, 66) are brachy-cephalic (see Table, p. 199), and\r\nare possessed, according to M. Arnould, of the following characters.\r\nThe apex of the cranial vault is flattened, probably artificially, and\r\nthe parietal bosses are largely developed, to which is due the great\r\nwidth of the skull. The surciliary ridges are strongly marked, and the\r\nmalar bones are prominent. In all these particulars they agree with the\r\nbroad skulls, as defined by Dr. Thurnam, discovered in the round tumuli\r\nof Britain and the sepulchral caves of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Platycnemic tibia, from Sclaigneaux.]\r\n\r\nSome of the leg-bones presented the antero-posterior flattening, or\r\nplatycnemism, observed in the skeletons from the caves of Gibraltar,\r\nand in France and Great Britain (Fig. 67). It is due, as in those from\r\nNorth Wales, to the anterior expansion of the bone, and not to the\r\nposterior, as is the case with those from the cave of Cro-Magnon.\r\n\r\nA beautifully chipped arrow-head, with barbs and central tongue for\r\ninsertion into the shaft, of the same type as one from Chauvaux,\r\nimplies that these remains belong to the neolithic age. Implements of\r\nbone, and a shell perforated for suspension, were also found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Evidence of History as to the Peoples of Gaul and Spain._\r\n\r\nThe extension of this non-Aryan race through France, Spain, and\r\nBritain, in ancient times, based solely on the evidence of the human\r\nremains, is confirmed by an appeal to the ethnology of Europe within\r\nthe historic period. In the Iberian peninsula the Basque populations\r\nof the west are defined from the Celtic of the east by the Celtiberi\r\ninhabiting the modern Castille (see Map, Fig. 68). In Gaul the province\r\nof Aquitania extended as far north, in Cæsar’s time,[140] as the river\r\nGaronne, constituting the modern Gascony, to which was added, in the\r\ndays of Augustus, the district between that river and the Loire;\r\na change of frontier that was probably due to the predominance of\r\nBasque blood in a mixed race in that area similar to the Celtiberi\r\nof Castille. The Aquitani were surrounded on every side, except the\r\nsouth, by the Celtæ, extending as far north as the Seine, as far to\r\nthe east as Switzerland and the plains of Lombardy, and southwards,\r\nthrough the valley of the Rhone and the region of the Volcæ, over the\r\nEastern Pyrenees into Spain. The district round the Phocæan colony\r\nof Marseilles was inhabited by Ligurian tribes, who held the region\r\nbetween the river Po and the Gulf of Genoa, as far as the western\r\nboundary of Etruria, and who probably extended to the west along\r\nthe coast of Southern Gaul as far as the Pyrenees.[141] They were\r\ndistinguished from the Celtæ, not merely by their manners and customs,\r\nbut by their small stature and dark hair and eyes, and are stated by\r\nPliny and Strabo to have inhabited Spain. They have also left marks of\r\ntheir presence in Central Gaul in the name of the Loire (Ligur), and\r\npossibly in Britain in the obscure name of the Lloegrians. They invaded\r\nSicily[142] as the Sikelians, and _if_ the latter be identified with\r\nthe Sikanians considered by Thucydides[143] and other writers to be\r\nof Iberian stock, it will follow that they are a cognate race. Their\r\nstature and swarthy complexion, as well as the ancient geographical\r\nposition conterminous with the Iberic population of Gaul and Spain,\r\nconfirm this conclusion. The non-Aryan and probably Basque population\r\nof Gaul was therefore cut into two portions by a broad band of Celts,\r\nwhich crosses the Eastern Pyrenees, and marks the route by which the\r\nIberian peninsula was invaded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Distribution of Basque, Celtic, and Belgic\r\nPeoples, at dawn of History.]\r\n\r\nThe ancient population of Sardinia is stated by Pausanias to be of\r\nLibyan extraction, and to bear a strong resemblance to the Iberians in\r\nphysique and in habits of life, while that of Corsica is described by\r\nSeneca as Ligurian and Iberian. The ancient Libyans are represented\r\nat the present day by the Berber and Kabyle tribes which are, if\r\nnot identical with, at all events cognate with the Basques. We may\r\ntherefore infer that these two islands were formerly occupied by this\r\nnon-Aryan race, as well as the adjacent continents of Northern Africa\r\nand Southern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Basque Population the Oldest._\r\n\r\nThe relative antiquity of these two races in Europe may be arrived at\r\nby this distribution. The Basques, Sikani or Ligurian, are the oldest\r\ninhabitants, in their respective districts, known to the historian;\r\nwhile the Celts appear as invaders, pressing southwards and westwards\r\non the populations already in possession, flooding over the Alps and\r\nunder Brennus sacking Rome, and by their union with the vanquished\r\nin Spain constituting the Celtiberi. We may therefore be tolerably\r\ncertain that the Basques held France and Spain before the invasion of\r\nthe Celts, and that the non-Aryan peoples were cut asunder, and certain\r\nparts of them left--Ligurians, Sikani, and in part Sardinians and\r\nCorsicans--as ethnological islands, marking, so to speak, an ancient\r\nBasque non-Aryan continent which had been submerged by the Celtic\r\npopulations advancing steadily westwards.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Roman conquest of Gaul, the Belgæ were pressing on\r\nthe Celts, just as the latter pressed the Basques, the Seine and the\r\nMarne forming their southern boundary, and in their turn being pushed\r\nto the west by the advance of the Germans in the Rhine provinces. Thus\r\nwe have the oldest population, or Basque, invaded by the Celts, the\r\nCelts by the Belgæ, and these again by the Germans; their relative\r\npositions stamping their relative antiquity in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Population of Britain._\r\n\r\nThe Celtic and Belgic invasion of Gaul repeated itself, as might\r\nbe expected, in Britain. Just as the Celts pushed back the Iberian\r\npopulation of Gaul as far south as Aquitania, and swept round it into\r\nSpain, so they crossed over the Channel and overran the greater portion\r\nof Britain, until the Silures, identified by Tacitus[144] with the\r\nIberians, were left only in those fastnesses that formed subsequently\r\na bulwark for the Brit-Welsh against the English invaders. And just\r\nas the Belgæ pressed on the rear of the Celts as far as the Seine,\r\nso they followed them into Britain, and took possession of the “Pars\r\nMaritima,”[145] or southern counties. The unsettled condition of the\r\ncountry at the time of Cæsar’s invasion was, probably, due to the\r\nstruggle then going on between Celts and Belgæ.\r\n\r\nThe evidence offered by history as to the distribution of these races\r\nconfirms that which has been arrived at by the examination of the caves\r\nand tumuli. In the one case the Basque peoples are merely known in a\r\nfragmentary condition in Britain, Gaul, and Sicily, while in the other\r\nthose fragments are joined together in such a way as to show that, in\r\nthe neolithic age, they extended uninterrupedly through Western Europe,\r\nfrom the Pillars of Hercules in the south to Scotland in the north,\r\nbefore they were dispossessed by their broad-headed enemies. It is\r\nimpossible to define with precision their ethnological relation to the\r\nnon-Aryan inhabitants of Italy and the coasts of the Mediterranean,\r\nsuch as the Etruscans and Tyrrhenians. I am, however, inclined to hold\r\nthat they are all branches of the same race of “Melanochroi,” differing\r\nfar less from each other than the Celtic from the Scandinavian branch\r\nof the Aryan family.[146]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basque Element in present British and French Populations._\r\n\r\nThis non-Aryan blood is still to be traced in the dark-haired,\r\nblack-eyed, small, oval-featured peoples in our own country in the\r\nregion of the Silures, where the hills have afforded shelter to the\r\nBasque populations from the invaders.[147] The small swarthy Welshman\r\nof Denbighshire is in every respect, except dress and language,\r\nidentical with the Basque inhabitant of the Western Pyrenees, at\r\nBagnères de Bigorre.\r\n\r\nThe small dark-haired people of Ireland,[148] and especially those\r\nto the west of the Shannon, according to Dr. Thurnam and Professor\r\nHuxley, are also of Iberian derivation, and singularly enough there is\r\na legendary connection between that island and Spain. The human remains\r\nfrom the chambered tombs as well as the riverbeds prove that the\r\nnon-Aryan population spread over the whole of Ireland as well as the\r\nwhole of Britain. The main mass of the Irish population is undoubtedly\r\nCeltic, crossed with Danish, Norse, and English blood.\r\n\r\nThe Basque element in the population of France is at the present time\r\ncentered in the old province of Aquitaine, in which the jet-black hair\r\nand eyes, and swarthy complexion, strike the eye of the traveller, now\r\nas in the days of Strabo,[149] and form a vivid contrast with the brown\r\nhair and grey eyes of the inhabitants of Celtica and Belgica (see Map,\r\nFig. 68). If Fig. 68 be compared with the map published by Dr. Broca\r\n(“Mémoires d’Anthropologie,” t. i. p. 330), which shows at a glance\r\nthe average complexion prevailing in each department, and the relative\r\nnumber of exemptions per 1,000 conscripts, on account of their not\r\ncoming up to the standard of height (1·56 metre = 5 feet 1½ inches),\r\nit will be seen that the only swarthy people outside the boundary of\r\nAquitaine constitute five ethnological islands. Of these Brittany is by\r\nfar the largest, probably because its fastnesses afforded a shelter to\r\nthe Basques, who were being driven to the south-west. The department\r\nof the Meuse, in the north, and those of Tarn and Arriège, in the\r\nsouth, are also sundered from the main body, while those of the Upper\r\nand Lower Alps present us with the descendants of the ancient Ligurian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nThe people with dark-brown hair, considered by Dr. Broca to be the\r\nresult of the intermingling of a dark with a fair race, are scattered\r\nabout through Aquitaine, and occur only in two departments in northern\r\nCeltica. The fair people, on the other hand, are massed in northern\r\nCeltica and Belgica. The relation of complexion to stature may be\r\ngathered from the following table of exemptions per 1,000 for each\r\ndepartment:--\r\n\r\n  Départements noirs            98·5 to 189\r\n        ”      gris-foncés      64·  ”  97\r\n        ”      gris-clairs      48·8 ”  63·8\r\n        ”      blancs-clairs    23·  ”  48·5\r\n\r\nFrom this table it is evident that the swarthy people are the smallest\r\nand the fair the tallest, the intermediate shades being the result of\r\nfusion between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nThe distribution therefore of the small swarthy Basque, and tall fair\r\nCeltic and Belgic races in France at the present time, corresponds\r\nessentially with that which we might have expected from the evidence\r\nboth of history and of the neolithic caves and tombs.[150]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the many invasions of France, and the oscillations\r\nto and fro of peoples, the persistence of the Basque population is\r\nvery remarkable. It is not a little strange that the type should be so\r\nslightly altered by intermarriage with the conquering races.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whence came the Basques?_\r\n\r\nFrom what region did the Basques invade Europe? M. Broca, from their\r\nidentity with the Kabyles and Berbers, holds that they entered Europe\r\nfrom northern Africa, spreading over Spain, and passing over the\r\nPyrenees into southern France. It seems, however, to me, from their\r\nrange as far north as Scotland, and at least as far to the east as\r\nBelgium, that they travelled by the same route that the Celtic, Belgic,\r\nand Germanic tribes travelled long ages afterwards, coming from the\r\neast and pushing their way to the west: and that while one section\r\nchose this route, another mastered northern Africa, following the same\r\nwestward direction as the Saracens. On this hypothesis this great\r\npre-Aryan migration would start from the central plateau of Asia, from\r\nwhich all the successive invaders of Europe have swarmed off.\r\n\r\nThis view of the eastern derivation of the Basque peoples is confirmed\r\nby the examination of the breeds of domestic animals which they\r\npossessed. The _Bos longifrons_, the sheep, and the goat are derived\r\nfrom wild stocks that are now to be found only in central Asia; and the\r\ndog and breed of swine with small canines were also probably imported\r\nafter they had become the servants of man in the east.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Celtic and Belgic Brachy-cephali._\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of broad-skulls in the tumuli in this country, and\r\nin caves and tumuli in France, proves that the Basque peoples were\r\ninvaded during the neolithic age. And since Dr. Thurnam has shown\r\nthat they are identical in form with Celtic and Belgic skulls,[152]\r\nit follows that one or the other of these, probably the Celtic or the\r\nolder, was in possession of portions of Britain, Ireland, and Gaul at\r\nthat remote time. It is of course conceivable that non-Celtic races,\r\nphysically allied to the Celts or Belgæ, are represented by the human\r\nremains in question; but in that case they have left no mark behind\r\nby which they can be identified. And the supposition is rendered\r\nimprobable to the last degree by the fact, that the older or conquered\r\nrace--the Basque--still survives, in the area under consideration,\r\nthe invasions and vicissitudes which it has undergone. _A fortiori_,\r\nwould their conquerors have had a still greater chance of survival, in\r\nthe fastnesses which are offered by these countries. It is therefore\r\nreasonable to presume that the broad-headed peoples in the neolithic\r\ncaves and tombs are represented by the Celts, and possibly, though not\r\nprobably, in part by the Belgæ, rather than by the equally broad-headed\r\nWends, Sclavonians, and Fins, which are not known by the historian to\r\nhave settled in Gaul or in Britain. The successive invasions of Europe\r\nhave been invariably from the east to the west, so far as we have any\r\ncertain knowledge; and it is most improbable that Wends, Fins, or\r\nSclaves should have occupied these countries and subsequently have\r\nretreated eastwards against the current of the Celtic, Belgic, and\r\nGermanic invasions.\r\n\r\nThe Celtæ may, therefore, be inferred to have occupied Gaul and Britain\r\nin the ages of polished stone, bronze, and of iron, their encroachment\r\non the non-Aryan peoples being regulated by their strength, and the\r\namount of pressure on their rear. The Belgæ probably were not known\r\nin Gaul until the later portion of the iron age, and were of small\r\nimportance as compared with the Celts, whose arms were felt alike in\r\nGreece, Italy, Spain, and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe Celts were a tall, fair-haired, blue-eyed race (Xanthochroi),\r\ncontrasting strongly with the Basque “Melanochroi”, and in those\r\nparticulars agreeing with the Germans.[153]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ancient German Race._\r\n\r\nThe Germans, in the days of Cæsar, were advancing on the Belgæ in the\r\nRhine provinces, and on the Helvetii in Switzerland, and are recognized\r\nby Tacitus,[154] in Britain as the red-haired, tall inhabitants of\r\nCaledonia. Subsequently they spread over the west and south of Europe,\r\nas Goths, Franks, Scandinavians, English and Normans; in this country\r\nsweeping the Brit-Welsh into the hilly fastnesses of Wales, making\r\nsettlements on many points of the coasts of Ireland, and leaving\r\nbehind them, to this day, a considerable infusion of German blood\r\nin the Celtic and Basque populations. They were, unlike the present\r\ninhabitants of North Prussia and southern and middle Germany, a\r\ndolicho-cephalic people, their length of head being due, according to\r\nGratiolet, to a frontal instead of an occipital development, which\r\ncauses the long-headedness of the Basques. The Anglo-Saxon skull is\r\ndefined by Dr. Thurnam as prognathous, with large facial bones, and\r\nwith a cephalic index averaging ·75. And these characters are equally\r\nto be found in the Gothic, Frankish, and Scandinavian crania.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Conclusions._\r\n\r\nIn this outline of the ethnology of Gaul and Britain, it will be seen\r\nthat two out of the three ethnical elements (if the Belgic be classed\r\nwith the Celtic), of which the present population is composed, can be\r\nrecognized in the neolithic users of caves and builders of chambered\r\ntombs. A non-Aryan race either identical or cognate with the Basque\r\nis the earliest traceable in these areas in the neolithic age, and\r\nit probably arrived in Europe by the same route as the Celtic and\r\nGermanic, passing westwards from the plains of central Asia.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of Spain having been peopled from northern Africa,\r\nthe identity of the Berber and Kabyle with the Basque being due to\r\ntheir being descended from the same non-Aryan stock in possession of\r\nsouthern and western Europe, and northern Africa. They are to be looked\r\nupon as cousins rather than as connected by descent in a right line.\r\n\r\nThe Basque race was probably in possession of Europe for a long series\r\nof ages, before hordes either identical or cognate with the Celts\r\ngradually crept westward over Germany into Gaul, Spain, and Britain,\r\ndriving away, or absorbing, the inhabitants of the regions which they\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCAVES CONTAINING HUMAN REMAINS OF DOUBTFUL AGE.\r\n\r\n  The Caves of Paviland.--Engis.--Trou du Frontal.--Gendron.\r\n    --Neanderthal.--Gailenreuth.--Aurignac.--Bruniquel.--\r\n    Cro-Magnon.-- Lombrive.--Cavillon, near Mentone.--Grotta dei\r\n    Colombi in Island of Palmaria, inhabited by Cannibals.--General\r\n    Conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many prehistoric caves in Britain and on the Continent which\r\ndo not contain remains sufficiently characteristic to fix the date of\r\ntheir use, either for occupation or burial, unless the term neolithic\r\nbe understood to cover the wide interval between the palæolithic stage\r\nof the pleistocene on the one hand, and the bronze age on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Paviland Cave._\r\n\r\nThe Cave of Goat’s Hole[155] at Paviland, in Glamorganshire, explored\r\nby Dr. Buckland in 1823, offers an instance of an interment having been\r\nmade in a pre-existent deposit of the pleistocene age. It consists of\r\na chamber facing to the sea, in a cliff of limestone 100 feet high, at\r\na level of from 30 to 40 feet above the high-water mark. Its floor was\r\ncomposed of red loam, containing the remains of the woolly-rhinoceros,\r\nhyæna, cave-bear, and mammoth. Close to a skull with tusks of the\r\nlast animal a human skeleton (equalling in size the largest male\r\nskeleton in the Oxford Museum) was discovered; and in the soil, “which\r\nhad apparently been disturbed by ancient diggings,” were fragments of\r\ncharcoal, a small chipped flint, and the sea-shells of the neighbouring\r\nshore. Certain small ivory ornaments, found close to the skeleton, are\r\nconsidered by Dr. Buckland to have been carved out of the tusks of the\r\nmammoth near which they rested; and he justly remarks that, “as they\r\nmust have been cut to their present shape at a time when the ivory was\r\nhard, and not crumbling to pieces, as it is at present at the slightest\r\ntouch, we may from this circumstance assume for them a high antiquity.”\r\n\r\nMay we not also infer, from the fact of the manufactured ivory and\r\nthe tusks from which it was cut being in precisely the same state of\r\ndecomposition, that the tusks were preserved from decay, during the\r\npleistocene times, by precisely the same agency as those now found\r\nperfect in the polar regions--namely, the intense cold; that after\r\nthe skull of the mammoth had been buried in the cave, the tusks, thus\r\npreserved, were used for the manufacture of ornaments; and that, at\r\nsome time subsequent to the interment of the ornaments with the corpse,\r\na climatal change has taken place, by which the temperature in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany has been raised, and the ivory became decomposed\r\nthat up to that time had preserved its gelatine? On this point it is\r\nworthy of remark that fossil tusks have been discovered in Scotland\r\nsufficiently perfect to be used as ivory. The ornaments may, however,\r\nnot have been made from the fossil tusks.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the bones of sheep underneath the remains of mammoth,\r\nbear, and other animals, coupled with the state of the cave earth,\r\nwhich had been disturbed before Dr. Buckland’s examination of the cave,\r\nwould prove that the interment is not of pleistocene date. No traces of\r\nsheep or goat have as yet been afforded by any pleistocene deposit in\r\nBritain, France, or Germany.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland’s conclusion, that the interment is relatively more\r\nmodern than the accumulation with remains of the extinct mammalia,\r\nmust be accepted as the true interpretation of the facts. The intimate\r\nassociation of the two sets of remains, of widely diverse ages, in this\r\ncave show that extreme care is necessary in cave exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Engis._\r\n\r\nHuman remains have been obtained from some of the caves of Belgium\r\nunder circumstances which are generally considered to indicate that\r\nthey are of the same antiquity as the skeletons of the animals with\r\nwhich they are associated. The possibility, however, of the contents\r\nof caves of different ages being mixed by the action of water, or by\r\nthe burrowing of animals, or by subsequent interments, renders such an\r\nassociation of little value, unless the evidence be very decided. The\r\nfamous human skull discovered by Dr. Schmerling[156] in the cave of\r\nEngis, near Liége, in 1833, is a case in point. It was obtained from\r\na mass of breccia, along with bones and teeth of mammoth, rhinoceros,\r\nhorse, hyæna, and bear; and subsequently M. Dupont[157] found in\r\nthe same spot a human ulna, other human bones, worked flints, and a\r\nsmall fragment of coarse earthenware. The discovery of this last is\r\nan argument in favour of the human remains being of a later date than\r\nthe extinct mammalia, since pottery has not yet been proved to have\r\nbeen known to the palæolithic races who co-existed with them, while\r\nit is very abundant in neolithic burial-places and tombs. The fact of\r\nall the objects being cemented together by calcareous infiltration is\r\nno test of relative age, which cannot be ascertained without distinct\r\nstratification, such as that in the caves of Wookey and Kent’s Hole.\r\n\r\nIt seems therefore to me, that the conditions of the discovery are too\r\ndoubtful to admit of the conclusion of Sir Charles Lyell and other\r\neminent writers, that the human remains are of palæolithic age.\r\n\r\nThe skull is described by Professor Huxley[158] as being of average\r\nsize, its contour agreeing equally well with some Australian and\r\nEuropean skulls; it presents no marks of degradation, “and is in fact a\r\nfair average human skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher,\r\nor might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage.” Its\r\nmeasurements fall within the limits of the long-skulls described in the\r\npreceding chapter, and it certainly belongs to the same class.\r\n\r\nThe following Table will show the variation in size and form of the\r\nskulls mentioned in this chapter:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measurements of Skulls of doubtful antiquity._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n  |                         |       |        |       |Circum- |Cephalic|Altitu-|\r\n  |                         |Length.|Breadth.|Height.|ference.| index. | dinal |\r\n  |                         |       |        |       |        |        | index.|\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n  |Engis (Huxley)           |  7·7  |  5·4   |   --  |  20·5  |   ·700 |   --  |\r\n  |Trou du Frontal          |       |        |       |        |        |       |\r\n  |  (Pruner-Bey)           |  6·9  |  5·6   |   --  |  21·55 |   ·811 |  ·704 |\r\n  |Gailenreuth (Dawkins)    |  6·82 |  5·5   |   --  |  21·55 |   ·813 |  ·813 |\r\n  |Neanderthal              |       |        |       |        |        |       |\r\n  |  (Schaaffhausen)        | 12·0  |  5·75  |   --  |  23·   |   ·720 |   --  |\r\n  |Cro-Magnon, No. 1 (Broca)|  7·95 |  5·86  |   --  |  22·36 |   ·730 |   --  |\r\n  |      ”     ”   2    ”   |  7·52 |  5·39  |   --  |  21·26 |   ·71  |   --  |\r\n  |      ”     ”   3    ”   |  7·94 |  5·94  |   --  |  22·24 |   ·74  |   --  |\r\n  +-------------------------+-------+--------+-------+--------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trou du Frontal._\r\n\r\nThe human skeletons in the Trou du Frontal, situated in a picturesque\r\nlimestone cliff on the banks of the Lesse, near Furfooz, are considered\r\nby M. Dupont to be of the same age as the contents of the caves close\r\nby the Trou des Nutons and Trou Rosette, which have been inhabited by\r\npalæolithic savages. The following is the section (Fig. 69) which he\r\ngives of the deposits. Close to the river Lesse is the alluvium (No.\r\n1), below which is a clay (No. 2), with angular blocks passing upwards\r\nunder the rock shelter, and filling the cave. Under this is a stratum\r\nof loam (No. 3), resting on gravel (No. 4). Sixteen human skeletons\r\nwere discovered in the sepulchral cavity (S), at the mouth of which\r\nwas a large slab of rock (D), by which it was originally blocked up.\r\nA singular urn, with a round bottom and with the handles perforated\r\nfor suspension, was found at the entrance, together with flint flakes,\r\nornaments in fluorine, and eocene shells perforated for suspension.\r\nOutside, at the points H H, was an accumulation of broken bones,\r\nbelonging to the lemming, tailless hare (Lagomys), beaver, wild cat,\r\nboar, horse, stag, urus, chamois, goat, and other animals, birds and\r\nfishes. From the occurrence of fragments belonging to two reindeer,\r\nit is considered by M. Dupont to belong to the reindeer age. The old\r\nhearth was close by, at F (Fig. 69).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Section of the Trou du Frontal. (Dupont.)]\r\n\r\nFrom this section we may infer, that the rock-shelter was used by man\r\nat the points H H and F before the formation of the stratum No. 2,\r\nwhich is probably merely subaerial rain-wash, due to the disintegration\r\nof the adjacent rocks, and that the sepulchral cavity was a place of\r\nburial either before, or while No. 2 was accumulated. Can we further\r\nconclude that there is any necessary connection between the refuse-heap\r\nand the sepulchre in point of time? M. Dupont holds that the contents\r\nof all the caves in the cliff are palæolithic, and that the sepulchral\r\ncavity is therefore of that age.[159] It seems to me, however, that the\r\nevidence in favour of this view is not conclusive. The burial place may\r\nhave belonged to one people, and the refuse-heaps in the neighbouring\r\ncaves and _outside_ the slab in the rock-shelter of the Trou du Frontal\r\nto another. The form of the urn is remarkably like some of those which\r\nhave been obtained from the neolithic pile-dwellings of Switzerland,\r\nand therefore may possibly imply that the interment is of that age.\r\n\r\nThe human remains were mixed _pêle mêle_ with stones and yellow\r\nclay within the chamber. Two skulls, sufficiently perfect to allow\r\nof measurement, show that their possessors were broad-headed\r\n(brachy-cephalic), and of the same type as those of Sclaigneaux.\r\nThey are considered by the late Dr. Pruner-Bey to belong to the\r\n“type Mongoloide,” and are believed by M. Dupont to prove that the\r\npalæolithic inhabitants of Belgium were a Mongoloid race. They seem,\r\nhowever, to be of the same general order as the broad-skulls from the\r\nneolithic caves and tombs of France, and from the round barrows of\r\nGreat Britain, as well as those from the neolithic tombs of Borreby and\r\nMoën in Scandinavia. And they are looked upon by MM. de Quatrefages,\r\nVirchow, and Lagneaux,[160] as presenting the same type as that which\r\nis to be recognized in the present population of Belgium, in the\r\nneighbourhood, for example, of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nThese affinities may be explained by the view advanced by Dr. Thurnam,\r\nthat the broad-heads of the British, French, and Scandinavian tombs\r\nare cognate with the modern Fin; or by the higher generalisation of\r\nProf. Huxley, that the Swiss “Dissentis” skull, the South German, the\r\nSclavonian, and the Finnish, belong to one great race of fair-haired,\r\nbroad-headed, Xanthochroi “who have extended across Europe from\r\nBritain to Sarmatia, and we know not how much further to the east and\r\nsouth.”[161]\r\n\r\nBesides these broad crania, M. Lagneaux[162] calls attention to a\r\nfragment, sufficiently perfect to indicate a skull of the long type\r\n(très dolicho-céphale), and that differed from them in many other\r\nparticulars. In the Trou du Frontal, therefore, there is proof that\r\na long and a short-headed race lived in Belgium side by side, just\r\nas a similar association in the cave of Orrouy establishes the same\r\nconclusion as to the neolithic dwellers in France. And since skulls\r\nof both these types have been discovered in the neolithic caves of\r\nSclaigneaux and Chauvaux, the interment in the Trou du Frontal may\r\nprobably be referred to that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Gendron._\r\n\r\nThe sepulchral cave of Gendron[163] on the Lesse, in which fourteen\r\nskeletons were discovered lying at full length, and in regular order,\r\nalong with one flake and some fragments of pottery, is of uncertain\r\nage, since those articles were found at the entrance, and have no\r\nnecessary connection with the interments. And if they were deposited\r\nat the same time, M. Dupont’s view that they stamp the neolithic age\r\nis rendered untenable by the fact that flakes and rude pottery were\r\nin use as late as the date of the Roman conquest of Britain, and are\r\nfrequently met with in association with articles of bronze and of iron.\r\nAnd for the same reasons the neolithic age of the human bones in the\r\nTrou de Sureau and of the Trou de Pont-à-Lesse is open to considerable\r\ndoubt. The contents, however, prove these caves to be post-pleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave of Gailenreuth._\r\n\r\nThe same uncertainty overhangs the age of the interments in the cave\r\nof Gailenreuth, in Franconia, from which Dr. Buckland[164] obtained\r\na human skull of the same broad type as that from Sclaigneaux, along\r\nwith fragments of black coarse pottery, one of which is ornamented with\r\na line of finger-impressions. The skull is remarkable for the great\r\nwidth of the parietal protuberances, and the flattening of the upper\r\nand posterior region of the parietal bone. Its measurements are given\r\nin the Table, p. 236, from which it will be seen that it belongs to the\r\nsame class of skulls as those from the neolithic caves and tumuli of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave of Neanderthal._\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary skull found in 1857 in the cave of Neanderthal,[165]\r\nby Dr. Fuhlrott, with some of the other bones of the skeleton, was\r\nnot associated with any other animals from which its age could be\r\ninferred. “Under whatever aspect,” writes Professor Huxley, “we view\r\nthis cranium, whether we regard its vertical depression, the enormous\r\nthickness of its supraciliary ridges, its sloping occiput, or its\r\nlong and straight squamosal suture, we meet with ape-like characters,\r\nstamping it as the most pithecoid of human crania yet discovered. But\r\nProf. Schaaffhausen states that the cranium, in its present condition,\r\nholds 1033·24 cubic centimetres of water, or about 63 cubic inches, and\r\nas the entire skull could hardly have held less than an additional 12\r\ncubic inches, its capacity may be estimated at about 75 cubic inches,\r\nwhich is the average capacity given by Morton for Polynesian and\r\nHottentot skulls.\r\n\r\nSo large a mass of brain as this would alone suggest that the pithecoid\r\ntendencies, indicated by this skull, did not extend deep into the\r\norganization, and this conclusion is borne out by the dimensions of\r\nthe other bones of the skeleton, given by Prof. Schaaffhausen, which\r\nshow that the absolute height and relative proportions of the limbs\r\nwere quite those of a European of middle stature. The bones are indeed\r\nstouter, but this, and the great development of the muscular ridges\r\nnoted by Dr. Schaaffhausen, are characters to be expected in savages.\r\nThe Patagonians, exposed without shelter or protection to a climate\r\npossibly not very dissimilar from that of Europe at the time during\r\nwhich the Neanderthal man lived, are remarkable for the stoutness of\r\ntheir limb-bones.\r\n\r\nIn no sense, then, can the Neanderthal bones be regarded as the remains\r\nof a human being intermediate between men and apes; at most they\r\ndemonstrate the existence of a man whose skull may be said to revert\r\nsomewhat towards the pithecoid type--just as a carrier, or a poulter,\r\nor a tumbler may sometimes put on the plumage of its primitive stock,\r\nthe _Columba livia_.”\r\n\r\nThis skull, like the preceding, belongs to the dolicho-cephalic\r\ndivision, reaching the enormous length of twelve inches, with a\r\nparietal breadth of 5·75.\r\n\r\nA long-skull found near Ledbury Hill in Derbyshire, and belonging\r\nto the river-bed type of Prof. Huxley, comes so close to this one\r\nof Neanderthal, that were it flattened a little and elongated, and\r\npossessed of larger supraciliary ridges, it would be converted into the\r\nnearest likeness which has yet been discovered.[166]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of France.--Aurignac._\r\n\r\nIn the cave of Neanderthal, the question of the antiquity of the human\r\nremains is not complicated by the juxtaposition of extinct pleistocene\r\nanimals or of palæolithic implements. Those caves, however, in France\r\nwhich claim especial attention, Aurignac, Bruniquel, and Cro-Magnon,\r\nare equally famous for their interments, and the palæolithic implements\r\nwhich they have furnished, along with the remains of the mammoth,\r\nwoolly rhinoceros, and other extinct animals.\r\n\r\nThey have both been inhabited by palæolithic man, and been used some\r\ntime for burial. Does the period of habitation coincide with that\r\nof the burial? This important question has been answered almost\r\nuniversally in the affirmative, and the interments are viewed as\r\nevidence of a belief in the supra-natural among the most ancient\r\ninhabitants of Europe, as well as offering examples of their physique.\r\n\r\nThe famous cave of Aurignac, near the town of that name, in the\r\ndepartment of the Haute Garonne, was explored and described by the late\r\nM. Ed. Lartet, and his conclusions were adopted by Sir Charles Lyell\r\nin the first three editions of the “Antiquity of Man.” In the fourth\r\nedition,[167] however, the latter author, after a reconsideration of\r\nall the circumstances, qualifies his acceptance of the palæolithic age\r\nof the interments, and shares the doubts which have been expressed by\r\nSir John Lubbock and Mr. John Evans. The evidence is as follows:--\r\n\r\nM. Lartet’s account falls naturally into two parts: first, the\r\nstory which he was told by the original discoverer of the cave;\r\nand, secondly, that in which the results of his own discoveries are\r\ndescribed. We will begin with the first. In the year 1852, a labourer,\r\nnamed Bonnemaison, employed in mending the roads, put his hand into a\r\nrabbit-hole (Fig. 70, _f_), and drew out a human bone, and having his\r\ncuriosity excited, he dug down until, as his story goes, he came to a\r\ngreat slab of rock. Having removed this, he discovered on the other\r\nside a cavity seven or eight feet in height, ten in width, and seven\r\nin depth, almost full of human bones, which Dr. Amiel, the Mayor of\r\nAurignac, who was a surgeon, believed to represent at least seventeen\r\nindividuals. All these human remains were collected, and finally\r\ncommitted to the parish cemetery, where they rest to the present day,\r\nundisturbed by sacrilegious hands. Fortunately, however, Bonnemaison in\r\ndigging his way into the grotto, had met with the remains of extinct\r\nanimals, and works of art; and these were preserved until, in 1860,\r\nM. Lartet accidentally heard of the discovery, and investigated the\r\ncircumstances on the spot. He found that Bonnemaison, and the sexton\r\nwho had buried the human remains, had taken so little note of the place\r\nwhere they were interred, that it could not be identified, and on\r\nexamining the cave he found that the interior had been ransacked, and\r\nthe original stratification to a great extent disturbed. M. Lartet’s\r\nexploration showed that a stratum containing the remains of the\r\ncave-bear, lion, rhinoceros, hyæna, mammoth, bison, horse, and other\r\nanimals, and palæolithic implements, like those of Périgord, extended\r\nfrom the plateau (_d_) outside into (_b_) the cave. On the outside he\r\nmet with ashes, and burnt and split bones, which proved that it had\r\nbeen used as a feasting-place by the palæolithic hunters; within he\r\ndetected no traces of charcoal, and no traces of the hyænas, which\r\nwere abundant outside. Inside he met with a few human bones in the\r\nearth which Bonnemaison had disturbed, which were in the same mineral\r\ncondition as those of the extinct animals, and he, therefore, inferred\r\nthat they were of the same age. Such is the summary of the facts which\r\nM. Lartet discovered. He has, of his own personal knowledge, only\r\nproved that Aurignac was occupied by a tribe of hunters during the\r\npalæolithic age, and that it had been used as a burial-place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Diagram of the Cave of Aurignac.]\r\n\r\nIs he further justified in concluding that the period of palæolithic\r\noccupation coincides with that in which the burial took place?\r\nBonnemaison’s recollections may be estimated at their proper value\r\nby the significant fact, that, in the short space of eight years\r\nintervening between the discovery and the exploration, he had forgotten\r\nwhere the skeletons had been buried. And even if his account be true\r\nin the minutest detail, it does not afford a shadow of evidence in\r\nfavour of the cave having been a place of sepulchre in palæolithic\r\ntimes, but merely that it had been so used at some time or another. If\r\nwe turn to the diagram constructed by M. Lartet to illustrate his views\r\n(“Ann. des Sc. Nat. Zool.,” 4^e sér., t. xv., pl. 10), and made for the\r\nmost part from Bonnemaison’s recollections; or to the amended diagram\r\n(Fig. 70) given by Sir Charles Lyell (“Antiquity of Man,” 1st ed., Fig.\r\n25), we shall see that the skeletons are depicted _above_ the stratum\r\n(_b_) containing the palæolithic implements and pleistocene mammalia;\r\nand therefore, according to the laws of geological evidence, they must\r\nhave been buried after the subjacent deposit was accumulated. The\r\nprevious disturbance of the cave-earth does away with the conclusion,\r\nthat the few human bones found by M. Lartet are of the same age as the\r\nextinct mammalia in the deposit. The absence of charcoal inside was\r\nquite as likely to be due to the fact that a fire kindled inside would\r\nfill the grotto with smoke, while outside the palæolithic savage could\r\nfeast in comfort, as to the view that the ashes are those of funereal\r\nfeasts in honour of the dead within, held after the slab had been\r\nplaced at the entrance. The absence of the remains of hyænas from the\r\ninterior is also negative evidence, disproved by subsequent examination.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the Rev. S. W. King, in 1865, complete the case\r\nagainst the current view of the palæolithic character of the\r\ninterments, since they show that M. Lartet did not fully explore the\r\ncave, and that he consequently wrote without being in possession of all\r\nthe facts. The entrance was blocked up, according to Bonnemaison, by a\r\nslab of stone, which, if the measurements of the entrance be correct,\r\nmust have been at least nine feet long and seven feet high, placed,\r\naccording to M. Lartet, to keep the hyænas from the corpses of the\r\ndead. It need hardly be remarked, that the access of these bone-eating\r\nanimals to the cave would be altogether incompatible with the\r\npreservation of the human skeletons, had they been buried at the same\r\ntime. The enormous slab was never seen by M. Lartet, and it did not\r\nkeep out the hyænas. In the collection made by the Rev. S. W. King from\r\nthe interior there are two hyænas’ teeth, and nearly all the antlers\r\nand bones bear the traces of the gnawing of these animals. The cave,\r\nmoreover, has _two_ entrances instead of one, as M. Lartet supposed\r\nwhen his paper in the “Annales” was published. The bones of the sheep,\r\nor goat, also obtained from the inside, and preserved in the Christy\r\nMuseum, afford strong evidence that the interment is not palæolithic;\r\nand a fragment of pottery, agreeing exactly with that used in the\r\nneolithic age, probably indicates its relative antiquity. This\r\nconclusion has also been arrived at by the two most recent explorers,\r\nMM. Cartaillac and Gautier.\r\n\r\nThe skeletons, therefore, in the Aurignac cave cannot be taken to be of\r\nthe same age as the stratum on which they rested; but, so far as there\r\nis any evidence, may probably be referred to the neolithic age, in\r\nwhich the custom of burial in caves prevailed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cavern of Bruniquel._\r\n\r\nThe famous cavern of Bruniquel, explored by the Vicomte de Lastic in\r\n1863-4,[168] and described by Professor Owen, is also one of the class\r\nwhich has furnished human bones, along with the remains of the extinct\r\nmammalia. It penetrates a cliff in the Jurassic limestone, opposite\r\nthe little village of Bruniquel (Tarn and Garonne), about forty feet\r\nabove the level of the river Aveyron. The bottom was covered with a\r\nsheet of stalagmite, resting on earth and blocks of stone, for the most\r\npart finely cemented into a breccia, that is black with the particles\r\nof carbon constituting the “limon noir” of the workmen, four or five\r\nfeet thick, beneath which is the “limon rouge,” or red earth without\r\ncharcoal, from three to four feet thick. Every part of the breccia\r\nis charged with the broken remains of the wolf, rhinoceros, horse,\r\nreindeer, stag, Irish elk and bison, and palæolithic implements of\r\nflint and bone; some of the latter having well-executed designs of the\r\nheads of horses and reindeer, which prove that the cave had been used\r\nas a place of habitation by the hunters of those animals. Imbedded in\r\nthe breccia at a depth of from three to five feet human bones were\r\nmet with, and in two recesses several individuals, including a child,\r\nwere found, one of which Professor Owen and the Vicomte de Lastic\r\ndisinterred with sufficient care to prove that the body had been buried\r\nin the crouching posture. The only calvarium sufficiently perfect to\r\nallow of a comparison belonged to the dolicho-cephalic type, and was\r\nvery fairly developed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen infers, from the intimate association of the human\r\nbones with the palæolithic implements and mammalia, that the cave\r\nof Bruniquel was used as a burial-place by the same people who had\r\nused it for habitation, and advances, in support of this, that the\r\nbones of man and of the animals are exactly in the same state of\r\npreservation, having lost the same amount of gelatine. The evidence,\r\nhowever, does not seem to be altogether conclusive. If the interment\r\nhad been made after the palæolithic inhabitants had forsaken the cave,\r\nthe association of the human bones with the refuse bones in their\r\nold refuse-heap must inevitably have taken place. And if, further,\r\nwater charged with carbonate of lime percolated the mass, it would be\r\nconverted into a hard breccia, and ultimately covered with a sheet of\r\nstalagmite. This calcification may have taken place in modern times.\r\nA modern bone, as Mr. Evans has observed in the case of Aurignac, may\r\nlose its gelatine in a comparatively short time, and become chemically\r\nidentical with those which have been imbedded in the same matrix for\r\nlong ages. The mineral condition, therefore, is an uncertain test of\r\nrelative antiquity.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it seems to be doubtful whether the interment is of\r\nthe same age as the occupation. The skull-shape, and the burial in the\r\ncrouching posture, point rather in the direction of the long-headed\r\nrace, that buried their dead in caves, in the neolithic age, in France,\r\nSpain, Belgium, and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Cro-Magnon._\r\n\r\nThe human skeletons in the cave of Cro-Magnon, at Les Eyzies, a little\r\nvillage on the banks of the Vezère in Périgord, fall into the same\r\ndoubtful category as those of Aurignac. The cave (Fig. 71, _f_),\r\nsituated at the base of a low cliff, was completely concealed by a\r\ntalus of loose débris, four metres thick, which had fallen from above.\r\n(Fig. 71, _b_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Section across the Valley of the Vezère, and\r\nthrough the rock of Cro-Magnon.\r\n\r\nLevel of the Vezère at low water, 58·25 metres above the sea.\r\n\r\nHeight of cave above the Vezère, 15 metres; above the sea-level, 73·25\r\nmetres.\r\n\r\nDistance from the cave to the river, 177 metres.\r\n\r\n  _a_ Railroad.\r\n  _b_ Talus.\r\n  _c_ Great block of stone.\r\n  _d_ Ledge of rock.\r\n   P  Limestone.\r\n   M  Detritus of the slopes and alluvium of the Valley.\r\n  _e_ Rock of Cro-Magnon.\r\n  _f_ Cave.\r\n  _g_ Château and Village of Les Eyzies, in the Valley of the Beaune.\r\n  _h_ Gatekeeper’s house.\r\n  _i_ Railway bridge over the Vezère.\r\n  _j_ Caves of Le Cingle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt forms one of a group of caves at various heights above the Vezère,\r\nwhich are very well represented in the preceding figure, which I am\r\nkindly allowed to borrow from the “Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ” (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\nAt the time of its discovery in 1868, in the course of making an\r\nembankment for the railway close by, and of obtaining material for\r\nmending the roads, it was completely blocked up. On the removal of this\r\n(_b_), by the contractors MM. Bertoú-Meyroú and Delmarés, the entrance\r\nwas exposed, and human remains and worked flints revealed, which were\r\ncarefully exhumed in the presence of MM. Laganne, Galy, and Simon.\r\nAt this stage of the exploration M. Louis Lartet was deputed, by the\r\nMinister of Public Instruction, to superintend the work, and from his\r\nreport the following account is taken (Lartet and Christy, “Rel. Aq.,”\r\np. 66) by the courtesy of the editors.\r\n\r\n“The cave of Cro-Magnon is formed by a projecting ledge of cretaceous\r\nlimestone (rich with fossil corals and polyzoans), having a thickness\r\nof 8 metres and a length of 17 metres (Fig. 72, P). The bed which it\r\noverlies, and the destruction of which has given rise to the cave,\r\nabounds with _Rhynchonella vespertilio_, which is a type fossil,\r\nfixing the geological horizon. The débris of this marly and micaceous\r\nlimestone had accumulated on the original floor of the cavern to a\r\ngreat thickness, at least for 0·70 metres (see Fig. 72, A), when the\r\nhunters of the reindeer stopped here for the first time, leaving as a\r\ntrace of their short stay a blackish layer (Fig. 72, B), from 0·05 to\r\n0·15 metre thick, containing worked flints, bits of charcoal, broken\r\nor calcined bones, and in its upper portion the elephant tusk before\r\nalluded to (Fig. 72, _a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Detailed Section of the Cave of Cro-Magnon,\r\nnear Les Eyzies. Scale = 1/100 (1 centimetre to 1 metre).\r\n\r\n   A  Débris of soft limestone.\r\n   B  First layer of ashes, &c.\r\n   C  Calcareous débris.\r\n   D  Second layer of ashes, &c.\r\n   E  Calcareous débris, reddened by fire under the next layer of\r\n          ashes, &c.\r\n   F  Third layer of ashes, &c.\r\n   G  Red earth, with bones, &c.\r\n   H  Thickest layer of ashes, bones, &c.\r\n   I  Yellowish earth, with bones, flints, &c.\r\n   J  Thin bed of hearth-stuff.\r\n   K  Calcareous débris.\r\n   L  Rubbish of the Talus.\r\n   N  Crack in the projecting ledge of rock.\r\n   P  Projecting shelf of hard limestone.\r\n   Y  Place of the pillar made to support the roof.\r\n  _a_ Tusk of an elephant.\r\n  _b_ Bones of an old man.\r\n  _c_ Block of gneiss.\r\n  _d_ Human bones.\r\n  _e_ Slabs of stone fallen from the roof at different times.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“This first hearth is covered by a layer (C), 0·25 metre thick, of\r\ncalcareous débris, detached bit by bit from the roof, during the\r\ntemporary disuse of the shelter. Then follows another thin layer of\r\nhearth-stuff (D), 0·10 metre thick, also containing pieces of charcoal,\r\nbones, and worked flints. This bed is in its turn overlain by a layer\r\nof fallen limestone rubbish (E), 0·50 metre thick. Lastly, there is\r\nover these a series of more important layers, all of them containing,\r\nin different proportions, charcoal, bones (broken, burnt, and worked),\r\nworked flints (of different types, but chiefly scrapers), flint cores,\r\nand pebbles of quartz, granites, &c. from the bed of the Vezère, and\r\nbearing numerous marks of hammering. Altogether these layers seem to\r\nhave reference to a period during which the cave was inhabited, if\r\nnot continuously, at least at intervals so short as not to admit of\r\nintercalations of débris falling from the roof between the different\r\nhearth-layers which correspond with the successive phases of this (the\r\nthird) period of habitation. The first (lowest) of these layers (F) is\r\nfull of charcoal, and has a thickness of 0·20 metre; it does not touch\r\nthe back of the cave, but extends a little further than the earlier\r\nlayers. At its line of contact with the calcareous débris beneath, the\r\nlatter is strongly reddened with the action of fire.\r\n\r\n“On the last-mentioned hearth-layer is a bed of unctuous reddish earth\r\n(G), 0·30 metre thick, containing similar objects, though in less\r\nquantities. Last in succession is a carbonaceous bed (H), the widest\r\nand thickest of all, having an average thickness of 0·30 metre; at the\r\nedges it is only 0·10 metre thick; but in the centre, where it cuts\r\ninto the subjacent deposits, which were excavated by the inhabitants\r\nin making the principal hearth, it attains a depth of 1·60 metre. This\r\nbed, being by far the richest in pieces of charcoal, in bones, pebbles\r\nof quartz, worked flints, flint cores, and bone implements, such as\r\npoints or dart-heads, arrowheads, &c., may be regarded as indicative of\r\na far more prolonged habitation than the previous.\r\n\r\n“Above this thick hearth-layer is a bed of yellowish earth (I), rather\r\nargillaceous, also containing bones, flints, and implements of bone,\r\nas well as amulets or pendants. This appears to be limited upwards by\r\na carbonaceous bed (J), very thin, and of little extent, 0·05 metre\r\nthick, which M. Laganne observed before my arrival, but of which only\r\nslight traces remained afterwards.\r\n\r\n“It was on the upper part of this yellow band (I), and at the back of\r\nthe cave, that the human skeletons and the accessories of the sepulture\r\nwere met with; and all of them were found in the calcareous débris\r\n(K), except in a small space in the furthest hollow at the back of the\r\ncave. This last deposit also contains some worked flints, mixed up with\r\nbroken bones, and with some uninjured bones referable to small rodents\r\nand to a peculiar kind of fox.\r\n\r\n“Lastly, above these different layers, and all over the shelter itself,\r\nlay the rubbish of the talus (four to six metres thick), sufficient\r\nin itself, according to what we have said above about its mode of\r\nformation, to carry back the date of the sepulture to a very distant\r\nperiod in the prehistoric age.\r\n\r\n“As for the human remains, and the position they occupied in bed I, the\r\nfollowing are the results of my careful inquiries in the matter. At\r\nthe back of the cave was found an old man’s skull (_b_), which alone\r\nwas on a level with the surface, in the cavity not filled up in the\r\nback of the cave, and was therefore exposed to the calcareous drip\r\nfrom the roof, as is shown by its having a stalagmitic coating on some\r\nparts. The other human bones, referable to four other skeletons, were\r\nfound around the first, within a radius of about 1·50 metre. Among\r\nthese bones were found, on the left of the old man, the skeleton of a\r\nwoman, whose skull presents in front a deep wound, made by a cutting\r\ninstrument, but which did not kill her at once, as the bone has been\r\npartly repaired within; indeed our physicians think that she survived\r\nseveral weeks. By the side of the woman’s skeleton was that of an\r\ninfant which had not arrived at its full time of fœtal development. The\r\nother skeletons (Fig. 70, _d_) seem to have been those of men.\r\n\r\n“Amidst the human remains lay a multitude of marine shells (about 300),\r\neach pierced with a hole, and nearly all belonging to the species\r\n_Littorina littorea_ so common on our Atlantic coasts. Some other\r\nspecies, such as _Purpura lapillus_, _Turritella communis_, &c., occur,\r\nbut in small numbers. These are also perforated, and, like the others,\r\nhave been used for necklaces, bracelets, or other ornamental attire.\r\nNot far from the skeletons, I found a pendant or amulet of ivory, oval,\r\nflat, and pierced with two holes. M. Laganne had already discovered a\r\nsmaller specimen; and M. Ch. Grenier, schoolmaster at Les Eyzies, has\r\nkindly given me another, quite similar, which he had received from\r\none of his pupils. There were also found near the skeletons several\r\nperforated teeth, a large block of gneiss, split and presenting a large\r\nsmoothed surface; also worked antlers of reindeer, and chipped flints,\r\nof the same types as those found in the hearth-layers underneath.\r\n\r\n“... The presence, at all levels, of the same kind of flint scrapers,\r\nas finely chipped as those of the Gorge d’Enfer, and of the same\r\nanimals as in that classic station, evidently shows them to be\r\nrelics of the successive habitation of the Cro-Magnon shelter by the\r\nsame race of nomadic hunters, who at first could use it merely as a\r\nrendezvous, where they came to share the spoils of the chase taken\r\nin the neighbourhood; but coming again, they made a more permanent\r\noccupation, until their accumulated refuse and the débris gradually\r\nraised the floor of the cave, leaving the inconvenient height of\r\nonly 1·20 metre between it and the roof; and then they abandoned it\r\nby degrees, returning once more at last to conceal their dead there.\r\nNo longer accessible, except perhaps to the foxes above noticed,\r\nthis shelter, and its strange sepulture, were slowly and completely\r\nhidden from sight by atmospheric degradation bringing down the earthy\r\ncovering, which, by its thickness, alone proves the great antiquity of\r\nthe burial in the cave.”\r\n\r\nThese conclusions as to the age of the burial do not seem to me to be\r\nsupported by the facts of the case. That the cave was inhabited by a\r\ntribe of palæolithic hunters there can be no doubt, but no evidence\r\nhas been brought forward that it was used by them for the burial of\r\ntheir dead. They “abandoned it by degrees,” but what proof is there\r\nthat _they_ “returned once more to conceal their dead”? The interments\r\nare at a higher horizon than the strata of occupation, and therefore\r\nlater, and although palæolithic implements have been found “near” them,\r\nthe value of the latter, in indicating the date, is destroyed by their\r\noccurrence throughout the old floors below. If we suppose that long\r\nafter the cave had been inhabited by the hunters of the reindeer, it\r\nwas chosen by a family as a burial-place, all the conditions of the\r\ndiscovery will be satisfied. The pre-existent strata would be disturbed\r\nin the process of burial, and the burrowing of foxes, and possibly of\r\nrabbits, might bring the palæolithic implements into close association\r\nwith the human bones. Taking the whole evidence into account, I should\r\nfeel inclined to assign the interment to the neolithic age, in which\r\ncave-burial was so common; but whatever view be held, the facts do not\r\nwarrant the human skeletons being taken as proving the physique of the\r\npalæolithic hunters of the Dordogne, or as a basis for an inquiry into\r\nthe ethnology of the palæolithic races.\r\n\r\nThe largest cranium (see Table, p. 236), belonging to an old man, had\r\nthe frontal region well developed, is orthognathic, with upturned\r\nnasals, and dolicho-cephalic. The occipital protuberance, or probole,\r\nis small. The bones of the extremity imply a stature of not less than\r\nfive foot eleven inches for the man; the femur is carinate, and the\r\ntibiæ platycnemic (see Fig. 48).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Lombrive._\r\n\r\nThe human bones, obtained by MM. Garrigou, Filhol, and Rames, from the\r\ncave of Lombrive[169] in the Department of Ariège, are, equally with\r\nthose cited above, of doubtful antiquity. They were discovered on the\r\nsuperficial sandy loam, passing in places into a calcareous breccia,\r\nwhich rests at various levels in the chambers, passages, and fissures,\r\nalong with bones of the brown-bear, urus, small ox, reindeer, stag,\r\nhorse, and dog. From the occurrence of the reindeer the deposit is\r\nassigned to the palæolithic age. But since this animal has been proved\r\nto have been eaten in Scotland by the neolithic men of Caithness, and\r\nto have inhabited Britain in the prehistoric age, it is by no means\r\nimprobable that it may also have lived in the region of the Pyrenees in\r\npost-pleistocene times. The presence of the dog and the small domestic\r\nox (_Bos longifrons?_) fixes the date of the accumulation as not being\r\nearlier than prehistoric; for both those animals were introduced into\r\nEurope by neolithic peoples.\r\n\r\nThe two human skulls, described by Professor Vogt, from this deposit\r\nconfirm this conclusion, since they are of the broad type, and differ\r\nin no important character (Thurnam) from those of the neolithic\r\nbrachy-cephali of France and Belgium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Cavillon, near Mentone._\r\n\r\nThe cave of Cavillon, explored by M. Rivière, in 1872, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Mentone, a few hundred yards on the Italian side of\r\nthe frontier of France, is another case of the occurrence of human\r\nremains in association with those of the extinct animals. The floor\r\nis composed of dark earth, full of charcoal and fragments of bones,\r\nmingled with blocks of stone which have dropped from the roof. Below\r\nit, at a depth of six and a half metres, a skeleton was met with, as\r\nwell as flint-flakes, rude instruments of bone, and a number of shells\r\nperforated for suspension. The skull was covered with a head-dress\r\nof more than 200 perforated sea-shells. It rested in an attitude\r\nof repose, with the legs and arms bent,[170] as may be seen in the\r\nadmirable photo-lithograph given by M. Rivière in the volume of the\r\n“International Congress of Prehistoric Archæology,” published at\r\nBrussels, pl. 6. The teeth and bones of hyæna, lion, woolly rhinoceros,\r\nmammoth, and other pleistocene animals occurred both in the soil above\r\nand below, and for that reason both the discoverer and Sir Charles\r\nLyell believe that the interment dates back to the time when those\r\nanimals were living. If, however, neolithic savages, or those of a\r\nlater age, had buried the skeleton in the earth containing the extinct\r\nanimals, all the circumstances which have been noticed, either by Mr.\r\nPengelly or Mr. Moggridge,[171] may be satisfactorily explained. There\r\nare no stalagmites to divide one stratum from another, and were an\r\ninterment made in the cave at the present time, the discoverer two or\r\nthree centuries hence might assert, with equal justice, that it took\r\nplace in the pleistocene age, because of the association with the\r\nanimals characteristic of that remote period.\r\n\r\nThe superficial portions of the cave-earth had certainly been\r\ndisturbed, and there is no evidence that the disturbance did not extend\r\ndown to the horizon where the skeleton rested. Nevertheless, Mr.\r\nPengelly concludes that the interment is of palæolithic age from its\r\nanalogy with that of Cro-Magnon and Paviland, which we have seen to be\r\nof equally doubtful antiquity. It seems to me that this conclusion,\r\nwhich is almost universally accepted, is not warranted by the facts,\r\nand that it cannot be used in support of any speculation as to the\r\ncondition of man in the pleistocene age.\r\n\r\nThe skull is described by M. Rivière as long, the thigh-bones are\r\nstrongly carinate, and the tibiæ are platycnemic as in the case of\r\nthose from Cro-Magnon, Gibraltar, Sclaigneaux, and North Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grotta dei Colombi in Island of Palmaria, inhabited by Cannibals._\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Professor Capellini for an account of the\r\nexploration of the Grotta dei Colombi, a cave in a vertical cliff\r\nin the island of Palmaria,[172] overlooking to the south the Gulf of\r\nSpezzia. In the red loam, composing the floor, were numerous flakes and\r\nscrapers, a rounded “striker” of Saussurite, quartz, pebbles, fragments\r\nof pottery, a bone needle, a whistle made of the first phalange of a\r\ngoat’s foot, shells perforated for suspension, _Natica mille-punctata_,\r\n_Pectunculus glycimeris_, and _Patella cærulea_, together with bones of\r\ngoat, hog, ox, wolf, wild cat, and broken and cut human bones belonging\r\nto children and young adults.\r\n\r\nAmong the remains Professor Capellini draws attention in particular to\r\nthe thigh-bones, scorched by fire, one of which bears incisions on its\r\nposterior face made by a flint implement in cutting away the flesh (Pl.\r\n73, _a_), and is also marked by scraping. He considers that they belong\r\nto an ape, closely allied to the _Macacus innuus_ of Gibraltar and\r\nNorth Africa, and concludes, therefore, that the animal was living in\r\nPalmaria at the time that the cave was inhabited. This identification\r\nis forbidden by the spongy texture, the rounded contour, and the\r\nabsence of epiphyses that imply that the bone was very young, and that\r\nin the adult it would be far larger than any thigh-bone of the apes. On\r\ncomparing his figures with eight femora belonging to young children,\r\nfrom the cairn at Cefn, and the caves at Perthi-Chwareu, I find that\r\nthey agree in every particular with two, the flattening of the inferior\r\nextremity, considered by Prof. Calori to be a non-human character,\r\nbeing equally met with in all, and being relatively greater in the\r\nyounger than the older. They offer, therefore, unmistakeable proof that\r\nthe inhabitants of the cave were cannibals (Fig. 73). I am informed by\r\nmy friend, Prof. Busk, that the bone figured belonged to a child about\r\neight years old. The outline _b_ in the figure represents the contour\r\nof one of the femora from the cavern at Cefn, described in the fifth\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Thigh-bone of child from Grotta dei Colombi\r\n(Capellini). _a_, Cuts; _b_, Outline of corresponding thigh-bone from\r\ncavern at Cefn.]\r\n\r\nIn this cave, as in those quoted above, there are no polished stone\r\nimplements, or works of art, that establish that these feasts\r\nwere carried on in the cave by neolithic cannibals, for the rude\r\nflint-flakes and bone articles, taken by Professor Capellini to fix\r\nits date, are common both to the palæolithic and the bronze ages.\r\nNevertheless, since the inhabitants have left behind no trace of\r\nany metal, and since their food was wholly supplied by the existing\r\nanimals, they were probably in the neolithic stage of culture, if this\r\nbe taken to cover the wide interval extending from the pleistocene\r\nto the age of bronze. They are proved, by the rudeness of their\r\nimplements, to have been savages of a very low order.\r\n\r\nWe may gather from various allusions, and stories scattered through the\r\nclassical writers, such for example as that of the Cyclops, that the\r\ncaves on the shores of the Mediterranean were inhabited by cannibals\r\nin ancient times. In the island of Palmaria we meet with unmistakeable\r\nproof that it was no mere idle tale or poetical dream. But we have no\r\nproof that cannibalism was universally practised at any stage in the\r\nhistory of man. All the caves of Europe, explored up to the present\r\ntime, merely afford some three or four examples in the neolithic\r\nand bronze ages. In the pleistocene there is no instance which is\r\ndevoid of doubt. This atrocious practice is therefore to be viewed as\r\nabnormal, and it probably became ingrafted into the religious ideas of\r\nthe nations of antiquity from the horror by which it was surrounded,\r\nultimately surviving in the form of human sacrifices to the offended\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Conclusions as to Prehistoric Caves._\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the fifth and sixth chapters that the prehistoric caves\r\nwhich are so unimportant in the ages of bronze and iron, were used\r\nin the neolithic age throughout western Europe both for habitation\r\nand burial, and that they therefore offer us most valuable materials\r\nfor working out the ethnology of Europe at that remote time. The two\r\nraces of men, the remains of which they contain, are represented by\r\nthe modern Basque and Berber on the one hand, and on the other by the\r\nCelt, and in Russia and Germany by the cognate Finn, Sclave, and Wend.\r\nAnd since all the human remains described in the present chapter, those\r\nof Cro-Magnon and possibly of the Grotta dei Colombi being exempted,\r\nbelong to one of other of these types, they may be referred to the\r\nneolithic age with a high degree of probability. In the present stage\r\nof the inquiry, it is much safer to put them into a distinct class,\r\napart from those to which we can assign a relative age with tolerable\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn the long ages which elapsed between the close of the pleistocene\r\nperiod and the dawn of history other races than these may have occupied\r\nEurope, and have passed away without leaving any clue as to their\r\nidentity. But in the present state of our knowledge we are justified\r\nonly in concluding, that the oldest population in prehistoric times\r\nwas non-Aryan, the traces of which are left behind not merely in the\r\ncaves and tombs, but in language,[173] and in the small dark-haired\r\ninhabitants of western and southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric peoples lived under physical conditions very different\r\nfrom those of central and western Europe at the present time; the\r\nsurface of the country being covered with rock, forest, and morass,\r\nwhich afforded shelter to the elk, bison, urus, stag, megaceros, and\r\nwild boar, as well as to innumerable wolves. They arrived from the\r\neast with cereals and domestic animals, some of which, such as the\r\n_Bos longifrons_ and _Sus palustris_, reverted to their original wild\r\nstate. From the very exigencies of their position they lived partly by\r\nhunting, and they gradually pushed their way westward, carrying with\r\nthem the rudiments of that civilization which we ourselves possess.\r\n\r\nIt is an open question whether they came into contact with the\r\npalæolithic races which preceded them.\r\n\r\nThe climate which they enjoyed was sufficiently severe to allow the\r\nreindeer to inhabit the district on which now stands the city of\r\nLondon, and its severity may also be inferred from the thickness of\r\nthe bark of the Scotch firs, observed by Mr. Godwin-Austen in the\r\nsubmarine forests of the south of England, and by Mr. James Geikie\r\nin those of Scotland. The area of Great Britain was greater then,\r\nthan now, since a plain extended seawards from the coast-line, nearly\r\neverywhere, supporting a dense forest of Scotch fir, oak, birch, and\r\nalder, the relics of which are to be seen in the beds of peat, and the\r\nstumps of the trees, near low-water mark on most of our shores. And\r\nit may be inferred that the forest extended a considerable distance\r\nfrom the present sea margin, from the large size of the trunks of the\r\ntrees.[174]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PLEISTOCENE CAVES OF GERMANY AND GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n  Relation of Pleistocene to Prehistoric Period.--Magnitude of the\r\n    Interval.--Animals.--Physical changes.--Excavation and\r\n    filling up of Valleys: Fisherton; Freshford.--Comparison of\r\n    Deposits in Valleys with those of Caves.--Differences of Mineral\r\n    Condition.--The Pleistocene Caves of Germany: Gailenreuth;\r\n    Kühloch.--Of Great Britain.--The Caves of Yorkshire:\r\n    Kirkdale.--Of Derbyshire: The Dream Cave.--Of North Wales,\r\n    near St. Asaph.--Of South Wales, in counties of Glamorgan,\r\n    Caermarthen, Pembroke.--Of Monmouth.--Of Gloucestershire.--\r\n    Of Somersetshire: Uphill, Banwell, Bleadon, Sandford Hill, Wookey\r\n    Hole.--The District of Mendip higher in Pleistocene age than\r\n    now.--The condition of bones gnawed by Hyænas.--The Caves of\r\n    Devonshire: Oreston; Brixham; Kent’s Hole.--The probable age of\r\n    the Machairodus of Kent’s Hole.--Those of Ireland, Shandon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Pleistocene to Prehistoric Period._\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in the fifth and sixth chapters, that the caves offer\r\nvaluable information as to the prehistoric ethnology of Europe, and\r\nthat they prove the ancient neolithic population to stand directly\r\nrelated to the Basque and Celtic elements in the present inhabitants\r\nof Britain, France, and Spain. We shall discover in the course of\r\nthis and the following chapters that no such continuity can be made\r\nout between the palæolithic man of the pleistocene age and any of the\r\nraces now living in our quarter of the world; and we shall see that\r\nhe is separated from his neolithic successor by an interval of time,\r\nthe length of which cannot be measured in terms of years. Before the\r\npleistocene group of caves be examined, it will be necessary to define\r\nthe relation that exists between the prehistoric and the pleistocene\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Animals--Magnitude of Interval._\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric mammalia consist, as we have seen (p. 136), with the\r\nsolitary exception of the Irish elk, of the wild animals at present\r\nliving in Europe, together with the domestic species and varieties\r\nintroduced by man, probably from central Asia. In the rest of this\r\nwork we shall have to deal, not merely with the wild animals at\r\npresent inhabiting Europe, but also with those which have either\r\nbecome extinct, or have migrated to Asia, America, or Africa. Besides\r\nthis addition to the European fauna in the pleistocene age, the total\r\nabsence of the domestic animals is a most important feature. The dog,\r\ngoat, sheep, Celtic short-horn, and domestic swine are conspicuous\r\nby their absence: the reputed association of their remains with\r\nthose of the pleistocene mammals being due, in all the cases which I\r\nhave examined in France and Britain, to a confusion between distinct\r\nstrata in the same cave or river-deposit, which are respectively of\r\npleistocene and prehistoric or historic ages. Thus in the excavations\r\nin the gravel underneath London, the Celtic short-horn and goat of the\r\nsuperficial strata are very generally mixed with the reindeer and\r\nmammoth of the pleistocene gravels below, by the collectors, and the\r\nnames of the domestic animals have crept into the pleistocene lists.\r\nNone of the domestic animals have been recorded from any carefully\r\nexplored strata of that age in any part of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe following late pleistocene species were unknown in Britain in the\r\nprehistoric age:--\r\n\r\n    Glutton.\r\n    Spotted hyæna.\r\n    Panther.\r\n    Lion.\r\n    Lynx.\r\n    _Felis Caffer._\r\n    Musk-sheep.\r\n    Bison.\r\n    Hippopotamus.\r\n    Lemming.\r\n    Pouched marmot.\r\n    Tailless hare.\r\n    _Lepus diluvianus._\r\n    _Arvicola Gulielmi._\r\n    Cave-bear.\r\n    _Rhinoceros hemitœchus._\r\n    _R. tichorhinus._\r\n    _Elephas antiquus._\r\n    Mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe glutton, lynx, bison, and lemming, still live in Europe, the\r\nspotted hyæna, _Felis Caffer_, and hippopotamus are peculiar to Africa,\r\nthe lion to Africa and Asia, and the last seven species are extinct.\r\nThe _Machairodus cultridens_ and _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ probably\r\ndisappeared in an early stage of the pleistocene. It may reasonably be\r\ninferred, from the migration and extinction of so many species between\r\nthe close of the pleistocene and beginning of the historic period, that\r\nthe interval was of considerable length; for it would be impossible for\r\nsuch changes to have taken place in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe same sharp line of demarcation exists between the two faunas on\r\nthe continent. The panther, _Felis Caffer_, lynx, spotted hyæna,\r\nmusk-sheep, hippopotamus, and the extinct group disappeared. The\r\nAfrican elephant forsook Spain and Sicily, the striped hyæna the\r\nsouth of France, before the prehistoric period; while the _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_ and pigmy hippopotamus of Sicily, and the pigmy elephant\r\nand gigantic dormouse of Malta, became extinct. Speaking in general\r\nterms, the wild fauna of Europe, as we have it now, dates from the\r\nbeginning of the prehistoric age, and consists merely of those animals\r\nwhich were able to survive the changes by which their pleistocene\r\ncongeners were banished or destroyed. The arrival of the domestic\r\nanimals under the care of man in the neolithic age, and their extension\r\nover the whole of Europe in a wild or semi-wild state, coupled with the\r\ndisappearance of the wild species mentioned above, constitutes a change\r\nin the mammal life at least as important as any of those which define\r\nthe meiocene from the pleiocene, or the pleiocene from the pleistocene\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physical changes--The excavation and filling up of Valleys._\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the interval between the two periods may also be\r\ngathered from the great changes which have taken place in physical\r\ngeography. In nearly every valley in Great Britain, certain areas to be\r\nmentioned presently excepted, are strata of sand and gravel, proved to\r\nbe of pleistocene age by their fossil mammals, and by their fluviatile\r\nshells to have been deposited by rivers. They occur at various heights,\r\nforming sometimes terraces, and at others isolated patches, which\r\nwere accumulated when the river flowed at their level, and before the\r\nvalleys were cut down to their present depth. Those at Fisherton near\r\nSalisbury, described by Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Prestwich, Mr. John\r\nEvans,[175] and others, may be taken as an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Section of Valley-gravels at Fisherton.\r\n(Evans.)]\r\n\r\nThe valley through which the river Wily flows is excavated in the chalk\r\n(Fig. 74), and on its northern side fluviatile deposits occur at two\r\nlevels, represented in the accompanying section. One patch of gravel,\r\nabout twelve feet thick, _a_, lies about eighty feet above the present\r\nlevel of the Wily; while a second, _b_, consisting of clayey brickearth\r\nor loam, with seams of gravel, and fluviatile shells, sweeps down\r\nfrom a lower point to the bottom of the valley, and passes under the\r\nriver. From the deposit _a_, Dr. Blackmore obtained many rudely-chipped\r\nimplements, of the same palæolithic type as those found with the\r\nextinct mammalia in the gravel beds at Amiens and Abbeville in the\r\nvalley of the Somme. In the deposit _b_, fossil mammalia were met with\r\nbelonging to the following animals:--\r\n\r\n    Spotted hyæna.\r\n    Lion.\r\n    Reindeer.\r\n    Stag.\r\n    Bison.\r\n    Urus.\r\n    Musk-sheep.\r\n    Wild boar.\r\n    Horse.\r\n    Woolly rhinoceros.\r\n    Mammoth.\r\n    Lemming.\r\n    Pouched marmot.\r\n    Hare.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackmore subsequently discovered a flint implement along with\r\nthese animals, of the same type as those previously met with in the\r\ndeposit _a_.\r\n\r\nA horizontal stretch of alluvium, _c_, deposited by the floods,\r\noccupies the present bottom of the valley. In this section it is plain\r\nthat the gravels and brickearth at _a_ and _b_ were deposited by a\r\nriver, which formerly flowed at those levels. In other words, the\r\nvalley of the Wily was excavated during the time that the pleistocene\r\nstrata _a_ and _b_ were being formed, while palæolithic man and the\r\nextinct animals were living in the neighbourhood. The position also of\r\n_b_ below the present bottom of the valley proves that the latter then\r\nwas deeper than it is now. The prehistoric alluvium, _c_, represents\r\nthe last stage in the history of the valley in which it is beginning to\r\nbe filled with the deposits of floods. While it was being accumulated\r\nnone of the animals of _a_ and _b_ were living in the district except\r\nthe hare, urus, stag, horse, and wild boar.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar section is exposed in the valley of the Avon at\r\nFreshford, near Bath, in a railway cutting, at a height of about\r\nthirty-five feet above the river. A thick mass of gravel abuts directly\r\nagainst a cleft of inferior oolite (Fig. 75), and gradually dies down\r\nto the alluvium. In it Mr. Charles Moore discovered the remains of the\r\nmusk-sheep, and the Rev. H. H. Winwood those of the mammoth, bison,\r\nhorse, and reindeer. In this case the pleistocene strata occupied the\r\nside of one of the valleys which had been deepened since the time of\r\ntheir deposit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Section of Valley-gravels at Freshford, Bath.\r\n4, Red loam, 5ft. 6in.; 3, Oolitic wash, 1ft.; 2, Clay with flints,\r\n4ft. 10in.; 1, Gravel with fossil mammals, 8ft.]\r\n\r\nThe alluvium in the neighbourhood of Bath contains in its lower\r\nportion a layer of peat, with bones of the Celtic short-horn (_Bos\r\nlongifrons_), stag, roe, horse, goat, and pig; and in its upper part\r\nare old refuse heaps, proved to be Roman by the coins and ware, which\r\nare also met with at various points underneath the surface soil, and\r\nsometimes at considerable depths. It is, therefore, of prehistoric and\r\nhistoric age, and since it is found only in the valley bottoms, we\r\nmay conclude that the present courses of the rivers along the sides\r\nof which it is found date back from the prehistoric age; while their\r\nancient courses are marked by the fluviatile deposits with the extinct\r\nmammalia standing at various levels, the higher being the older. In the\r\nsection at Fisherton we have evidence that the river flowed at a lower\r\nlevel in the pleistocene age than in the prehistoric, and in that at\r\nFreshford that the lower portion of the valley had been excavated after\r\nthe pleistocene strata had been formed. One or other of these physical\r\nchanges is to be traced in nearly all river valleys.[176] We may\r\nconclude that both imply a considerable lapse of time, because similar\r\nchanges are now produced with extreme slowness. In the pleistocene\r\nriver deposits, which lie scattered about at various heights on the\r\nvalley sides, we seek in vain for neolithic implements, or domestic\r\nanimals. In the low-lying alluvia, and accumulations of peat, we seek\r\nequally in vain for traces of palæolithic man, or of the extinct\r\nmammalia, except the Irish elk.\r\n\r\nWe may also gather, from the localization of the prehistoric alluvia\r\nclose to the present streams, that the time represented by its\r\naccumulation is insignificant in comparison with the long lapse of ages\r\nimplied by the pleistocene gravels and brickearths, that were deposited\r\nat various heights during the excavation of the valleys. The general\r\nsurface of the valleys has undergone but little change since history\r\nbegan, and the excavation by the rivers has been so small as to have\r\nescaped accurate measurement. The alluvia represent the principal work\r\ndone since the close of the pleistocene period.\r\n\r\nThe most important testimony that the interval between the two periods\r\nwas very long, is offered by the climatal change, and the severance\r\nof Britain from the continent. The arctic severity of the pleistocene\r\nwinter in these latitudes had passed away before the prehistoric age,\r\nand the pleistocene valleys of the North Sea, St. George’s Channel, the\r\nBritish, and Irish Channels had been depressed beneath the waves of the\r\nsea before any prehistoric strata yet known had been deposited. The\r\nevidence that these changes actually took place must be referred to the\r\ntwo following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Comparison of Deposits in Valleys with those in Caves._\r\n\r\nIf these valley deposits be compared with the contents of some of\r\nthe bone caves, such, for example, as those of the Victoria Cave\r\n(compare Figs. 74 and 75 with Figs. 20, 21, 29), it will be seen\r\nthat they present the same section. The pleistocene gravels and\r\nbrick-earths of the one correspond with the lower strata of the other,\r\nand contain the same extinct animals. The prehistoric alluvium of the\r\none is represented by the layer containing neolithic bronze or iron\r\nimplements, as well as the same animals; while the historic strata\r\nare represented in both by the superficial accumulations. The only\r\ndifference indeed between the one and the other is, that in the former\r\nthe strata of the three periods are spread over a wide area, while in\r\nthe latter they are super-imposed in vertical order, the pleistocene\r\nbelow, the prehistoric in the middle, and the historic on the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference in Mineral Condition of Deposits in Caves._\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric, and the historic strata in caves differ from the\r\npleistocene in their physical constitution. They are darker in colour,\r\nand more loosely stratified, and contain bones in a more friable and\r\nless mineralized condition, and are more free from stalagmite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Germany: Gailenreuth._\r\n\r\nThe use of fossil bones for medicinal purposes led, as I have already\r\nmentioned in the first chapter, to the exploration of caves, which\r\nwere first scientifically examined in Germany towards the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century. They abound in all the limestone plateaux,\r\nespecially in the region of Franconia, and in that of the Hartz. Among\r\nthem the most interesting, perhaps, is that of Gailenreuth, explored\r\nby Esper, Rosenmüller, Goldfuss, Buckland, Lord Enniskillen, and Sir\r\nPhilip Egerton. It penetrates a lofty cliff, that forms a side of the\r\ndeep gorge which the river Weissent has cut in the rock, at a point\r\nabout three hundred feet above the water level.\r\n\r\nThe entrance, Dr. Buckland[177] writes, is about seven feet high\r\nand twelve feet broad, and within it a short passage leads into two\r\nchambers (Fig. 76, A and B),[178] hung with stalactites, and with the\r\nfloors covered by a dense stalagmitic pavement, that has been more\r\nor less broken up by repeated diggings. These floors are perfectly\r\nhorizontal, the level of that of B being considerably below that of A.\r\nThey rest on an accumulation of reddish grey loam, containing pebbles,\r\nand angular limestone blocks, and vast quantities of the bones and\r\nteeth of the animals formerly living in the district. The depth of this\r\nossiferous deposit has not been ascertained, but in the further end\r\nof the chamber B, it has been proved to be more than twenty-five feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Section of Gailenreuth Cave. (Buckland.)]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the animals lie scattered in the wildest confusion;\r\nsometimes being completely matted together, but more generally each\r\nbone is enveloped in earth. They belong to the lion, the cave variety\r\nof the spotted hyæna, the cave-bear, grizzly bear, mammoth, Irish elk,\r\nand reindeer, as well as to those species which are still to be found\r\nin Germany, such as the glutton, brown bear, wolf, fox, and stag.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to account for such an accumulation as this, but\r\nit was probably introduced through the present entrance, and thence\r\ninto the chamber B, passing from the higher to the lower levels. The\r\nteeth-marks on the bones show that some of the animals had formed\r\nthe prey of the hyænas, but had they introduced all the bones there\r\nwould have been distinct strata marking the floors of occupation, as\r\nin Wookey Hole (Fig. 88). Moreover, no perfect skulls, such as those\r\nof the bears, would have escaped their powerful teeth. The pebbles in\r\nthe loam bear testimony to the passage of a current of water. And if\r\nwe suppose that the cave was subject to floods, such as those in the\r\nwater-caves described in the second chapter, the scattering of the\r\nbones through the loam may be explained. This, however, could not have\r\nhappened had the cave then opened on the face of a nearly vertical\r\ncliff, and the only condition under which it would have been possible\r\nis, that the present entrance should have been directly connected with\r\na stream flowing from the surface, that is to say, over the space now\r\noccupied by the gorge of the Weissent. If this view, advanced by Dr.\r\nBuckland, be accepted, the remoteness of the date of the filling up of\r\nthe cave may be measured by the fact, that since that time the gorge\r\nhas been cut down by the Weissent to a depth of more than 300 feet.\r\n\r\nThe stream by which the contents of the cave were introduced had a\r\ncourse probably analogous to that of Dalebeck (Fig. 6) and the remains\r\nof the animals were caught up from the surface, and accumulated in\r\nthe subterranean chambers which it traversed. Their abundance offers\r\nno obstacle to this view, since wild animals frequent their drinking\r\nplaces in vast numbers, and fall a prey to the carnivora which lurk\r\nnear the streams, and very many tumble into the natural pitfalls, or\r\nswallow-holes, so universal in limestone districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Kühloch._\r\n\r\nVery many other caves occur in the neighbourhood, most of them, such as\r\nthose of Zahnloch, celebrated for the abundance of fossil teeth, Mokas,\r\nRabenstein, and others, of which the cave of Kühloch alone demands\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe cave of Kühloch is situated opposite to the castle of Rabenstein,\r\nin the gorge of the Esbach, at about thirty feet from the bottom. Its\r\nexterior presents a lofty arch in a nearly perpendicular cliff, about\r\nthirty feet wide and twenty feet high, and the entrance gradually leads\r\ninto two large chambers “both of which terminate in a close round end,\r\nor cul-de-sac, at the distance of about 100 feet from the entrance.\r\nIt is intersected by no fissures, and has no lateral communications\r\nconnecting it with any other caverns, except one small hole close to\r\nits mouth, and which opens also to the valley.” The first thirty feet\r\npresent a steep slope towards the entrance. Dr. Buckland describes the\r\ncontents of the chambers in the following words:[179]--\r\n\r\n“It is literally true that in this single cavern (the size and\r\nproportions of which are nearly equal to those of the interior of a\r\nlarge church) there are hundreds of cart-loads of black animal dust\r\nentirely covering the whole floor, to a depth which must average at\r\nleast six feet, and which, if we multiply this depth by the length\r\nand breadth of the cavern, will be found to exceed 5,000 cubic feet.\r\nThe whole of this mass has been again and again dug over in search\r\nof teeth and bones, which it still contains abundantly, though in\r\nbroken fragments. The state of these is very different from that of\r\nthe bones we find in any of the other caverns, being of a black, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, dark umber colour throughout, like the bones\r\nof mummies, and many of them readily crumbling under the finger into\r\na soft dark powder resembling mummy powder, and being of the same\r\nnature with the black earth in which they are embedded. The quantity\r\nof animal matter accumulated on this floor is the most surprising, and\r\nthe only thing of the kind I ever witnessed; and many hundred--I may\r\nsay thousand--individuals must have contributed their remains to make\r\nup this appalling mass of the dust of death. It seems in great part to\r\nbe derived from comminuted and pulverized bone; for the fleshy parts\r\nof animal bodies produce by their decomposition so small a quantity of\r\npermanent earthy residuum, that we must seek for the origin of this\r\nmass principally in decayed bones. The cave is so dry, that the black\r\nearth lies in the state of loose powder, and rises in dust under the\r\nfeet; it also retains so large a proportion of its original animal\r\nmatter that it is occasionally used by the peasants as an enriching\r\nmanure for the adjacent meadows. I have stated that the total quantity\r\nof animal matter that lies within this cavern cannot be computed at\r\nless than 5,000 cubic feet; now allowing two cubic feet of dust and\r\nbones for each individual animal, we shall have in this single vault\r\nthe remains of at least 2,500 bears, a number which may have been\r\nsupplied in the space of 1,000 years by a mortality at the rate of two\r\nand a half per annum.”\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland’s explanation, that the cave was inhabited by bears for\r\nlong generations, is probably true. The absence of pebbles and silt\r\nshow that water had no share in the introduction of the remains; their\r\npreservation is due to the dryness of the cave, and to its proximity to\r\nthe outer atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe famous caves of Sundwig, Schartsfeld, and Bauman’s Hole, belong to\r\nthe same class as Gailenreuth, and offer no differences which need be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThese explorations establish the fact that, in the antediluvian age\r\nwhich we now term pleistocene, the lion, the cave-bear and grizzly\r\nbear, and cave-hyæna abounded in Germany, and that they sought as\r\ntheir prey not merely the wild animals now living in that region,\r\nbut the reindeer, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, and Irish elk. All the\r\ndiscoveries in the German caves from the date of the exploration of\r\nGailenreuth have merely verified this conclusion without adding any new\r\nfact of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Great Britain._\r\n\r\nThese discoveries in the German caves led to the exploration of those\r\nin our country. Dr. Buckland visited Gailenreuth in 1816, and in\r\n1821 applied the result of his knowledge gained in Germany to the\r\ninvestigation of the famous cavern of Kirkdale.[180]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hyæna-den at Kirkdale._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Plan of Kirkdale Cave. (Taylor.)]\r\n\r\nThe cave of Kirkdale (Figs. 77, 78) was discovered in a quarry in\r\nthe vale of Pickering, about twenty-five miles to the NN.E. of\r\nYork, at a point where the dale of Holmbeck joins Kirkdale. The\r\nentrance, eighty feet above the valley bottom and twenty feet from\r\nthe surface of the plateau above, was about three feet high and six\r\nfeet wide, and led into a passage from five to ten feet wide, which\r\nran nearly horizontally into the rock, and branched off into smaller\r\nramifications. Its general form and size may be gathered from the\r\nexamination of the accompanying woodcuts, which were published by Mr.\r\nTaylor in “Macmillan’s Magazine,” in September 1862. The roof was for\r\nthe most part free from stalactite, and there was no continuous coating\r\nof stalagmite on the floor, but merely here and there a few calcareous\r\nbosses termed “cows’ paps” by the workmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Sections of Kirkdale Cave. (Taylor.)]\r\n\r\nA layer of fine red loam covered the bottom, in the lower portions\r\nof which were large numbers of gnawed and broken bones, and teeth,\r\nfor the most part of the same species as those formed in the German\r\ncaves. In some places they were lying in little confused heaps, and in\r\nothers, where the loam was thin, were exposed to the calcareous drip\r\nand cemented into a mass, their upper portions projecting through the\r\nstalagmite “like the legs of pigeons through pie-crust,” and their\r\nirregular distribution resembling that of the fragments scattered on\r\nthe floor of a dog-kennel.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the animals were incredibly abundant, when the small\r\nspace in which they were packed was taken into consideration. Those of\r\nthe hyæna are estimated by Dr. Buckland as belonging to between two or\r\nthree hundred individuals of all ages. The lion and the cave-bear, the\r\nwild boar, the hippopotamus (Fig. 79) an extinct kind of elephant (_E.\r\nantiquus_), and the rhinoceros named by Dr. Falconer _R. hemitœchus_,\r\nthe reindeer, and Irish elk are also represented, but the species\r\nof most common occurrence are the bison and the horse. With a few\r\nexceptions all the bones with marrow were broken, and scarred by teeth,\r\nwhile the solid and marrowless were more or less perfect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Molar of Hippopotamus. (Buckland.)]\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland’s method of solving the problem of the introduction of\r\nremains of so many and different animals into so small a space, is\r\na model of scientific analysis. He argues from the abundance of the\r\nremains of the hyæna, and from the correspondence of their teeth with\r\nthe marks on the bones, and from the quantity of their coprolites,\r\nthat the cave was inhabited by many generations of those animals, and\r\nthat the gnawed fragments were relics of their prey. The hyænas of the\r\npresent day inhabit caves strewn with the bones of their prey, which\r\nare crushed by their powerful jaws into the same form as those of\r\nKirkdale. He further demonstrated the truth of his conclusion by the\r\ncrucial experiment of subjecting the leg-bone of an ox to a spotted\r\nhyæna from the Cape of Good Hope, in Wombwell’s Menagerie. “I was\r\nable,” he writes,[181] “to observe the animal’s mode of proceeding in\r\nthe destruction of bones: the shin-bone of an ox being presented to\r\nthis hyæna, he began to bite off with his molar teeth large fragments\r\nfrom its upper extremity, and swallowed them whole as fast as they were\r\nbroken off. On his reaching the medullary cavity, the bone split into\r\nangular fragments, many of which he caught up greedily and swallowed\r\nentire: he went on cracking it till he had extracted all the marrow,\r\nlicking out the lowest portion of it with his tongue: this done, he\r\nleft untouched the lower condyle, which contains no marrow, and is\r\nvery hard. The state and form of this residuary fragment are precisely\r\nlike those of similar bones at Kirkdale; the marks of teeth on it\r\nare very few, as the bone usually gave off a splinter before the\r\nlarge conical teeth had forced a hole through it; these few, however,\r\nentirely resemble the impressions we find on the bones at Kirkdale;\r\nthe small splinters also in form and size, and manner of fracture, are\r\nnot distinguishable from the fossil ones. I preserve all the fragments\r\nand the gnawed portions of this bone, for the sake of comparison by\r\nthe side of those I have from the antediluvian den in Yorkshire: there\r\nis absolutely no difference between them, except in point of age. The\r\nanimal left untouched the solid bones of the tarsus and carpus, and\r\nsuch parts of the cylindrical bones as we find untouched at Kirkdale,\r\nand devoured only the parts analogous to those which are there\r\ndeficient. The keeper, pursuing this experiment to its final result,\r\npresented me the next morning with a large quantity of _album græcum_,\r\ndisposed in balls, that agree entirely in size, shape, and substance\r\nwith those that were found in the den at Kirkdale. The power of his\r\njaws far exceeded any animal force of the kind I ever saw exerted, and\r\nreminded me of nothing so much as of a miner’s crushing mill, or the\r\nscissors with which they cut off bars of iron and copper in the metal\r\nfoundries.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Leg-bones gnawed by Hyænas--1, of Ox in\r\nMenagerie; 2, of Bison in Kirkdale. (Buckland.)]\r\n\r\nThe exact correspondence of one of the fragments of the tibia of an ox,\r\ngnawed by the Cape hyæna, with the corresponding bone of the bison from\r\nKirkdale, may be gathered from a comparison of the two figured in Fig.\r\n80, in which the teeth-marks _a_, _b_, and _c_, are very distinct. The\r\nsame kind of identity runs through the whole series of bones gnawed by\r\nthe living and fossil hyænas.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland’s conclusion, that the Kirkdale cave was the den of the\r\nspotted hyænas (_H. crouta_) that preyed upon the animals of Yorkshire\r\nin ancient times, and that it was undisturbed down to the time of its\r\nexploration, cannot be disputed. The tread of the hyænas in their\r\npassage to and fro had polished some of the bones and jaws scattered on\r\nthe floor, and the polished surfaces were uppermost, the rest of the\r\nfragments being rough. And Prof. Phillips informs me that the leg-bone\r\nof a ruminant was discovered wedged into a small fissure in the floor,\r\nwith that portion which was within reach of the hyæna’s teeth gnawed\r\naway, while the rest was uninjured. The hyæna had lost his bone in the\r\nfissure, and was only able to nibble the end which projected. In these\r\nincidents we have a vivid picture of an hyæna’s den in Yorkshire during\r\nthe pleistocene age, with the contents left in their natural order and\r\nnot rearranged by the passage of water.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria cave near Settle, in Yorkshire, described in the third\r\nchapter, has also been occupied by hyænas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of Derbyshire: the Dream-cave near Wirksworth._\r\n\r\nThe Dream-cave, near Wirksworth,[182] in Derbyshire, contrasts with\r\nthat of Kirkdale in the perfect state of the bones which it contains.\r\nIt was discovered in 1822, in following a vein of lead (Fig. 81).\r\nThe miners suddenly broke into a hollow, _c_, filled with red earth\r\nand stones, and as they continued their shaft downwards the sides\r\ncontinually closed upon them until the roof of a cave was revealed.\r\nA nearly perfect skeleton of the rhinoceros was discovered in the\r\nearth, as well as bones of the horse, reindeer, and urus. After a large\r\nquantity of the earth had been removed, the surface soil, _i_, at a\r\nlittle distance began to sink, and ultimately a vertical shaft was\r\nfound to connect the cave with the surface. Into this the animals had\r\nfallen, just as at the present time sheep and oxen frequently perish in\r\nsimilar natural pitfalls in the limestone strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--The Dream-cave, Wirksworth. (Buckland.)\r\n\r\n  A Shaft following lead-vein.\r\n  B Supposed continuation of lead-vein.\r\n  C Cave.\r\n  D Swallow-hole.\r\n  E Ossiferous loam.\r\n  F Antler of deer.\r\n  G Rhinoceros.\r\n  H Limestone.\r\n  I Natural entrance.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOther caves and fissures in Derbyshire have yielded remains of the\r\nextinct animals: those of Balleye, near Wirksworth, and of Doveholes,\r\nnear Chaple-en-le-Frith, the mammoth, and a small cave in Hartle Dale,\r\nnear Castleton, explored by Mr. Pennington and myself in 1872, the\r\nmammoth and the woolly rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of North Wales, near St. Asaph._\r\n\r\nThe ossiferous caves and fissures at Cefn, near St. Asaph, in the\r\nmountain limestone that forms the south side of the Vale of Clwyd, were\r\nfirst described in 1833,[183] by the Rev. Edward Stanley, afterwards\r\nBishop of Norwich, who explored that which Mr. E. Lloyd had discovered\r\nabout half-way down the vertical cliff, in the grounds of Cefn Hall.\r\nIt consists of a narrow passage, turning on itself, and communicating\r\nwith the surface of the cliff by two entrances, which were completely\r\nblocked up with red silt, containing a vast quantity of bones in very\r\nbad preservation. The bottom has not yet been reached. In one portion I\r\nfound, in 1872, a deposit of comminuted bone with scarcely any mixture\r\nof loam, that rose in clouds of dust as it was disturbed. The animals\r\nbelonged to the same class as those of Germany, the cave-bear, spotted\r\nhyæna, and reindeer, as well as the hippopotamus, _Elephas antiquus_\r\nand _Rhinoceros hemitœchus_ of the Kirkdale cave. Pebbles derived from\r\nthe boulder clay, and rounded waterworn fragments of bone, showed that\r\nthe contents had been introduced into this cave by a stream. Some of\r\nthe remains, which were marked with teeth, may have been introduced by\r\nthe hyænas. The flint-flakes found with the human skull and cut antlers\r\nof stag, already referred to in the fifth chapter, were discovered in\r\nthe lower entrance.\r\n\r\nThe same group of animals has been obtained by Mrs. Williams Wynn, the\r\nRev. D. R. Thomas, and myself out of a horizontal cave at the head\r\nof the defile leading down from Cefn to Pont Newydd, in which the\r\nremains are embedded in a stiff clay, consisting of rearranged boulder\r\nclay, and are in the condition of waterworn pebbles. From it I have\r\nidentified the brown, grizzly, and cave-bear. A further examination by\r\nthe Rev. D. R. Thomas, and Prof. Hughes, has recently resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of rude implements of felstone, and a tooth which has been\r\nidentified by Prof. Busk as a human molar of unusual size.[184]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Left Lower Jaw of Glutton, Plas Heaton Cave.]\r\n\r\nA third cave in the neighbourhood at Plas Heaton, explored in 1870 by\r\nMr. Heaton and Prof. Hughes, furnished the remains of the cave-bear,\r\nspotted hyæna, bison, and reindeer, and a remarkably fine specimen\r\nof the lower jaw of a glutton (Fig. 82), which I have described in\r\nthe “Geological Journal” (vol. xxvii. p. 406). In a fourth cave, at\r\nGallfaenan, the bear and reindeer were discovered. It is evident from\r\nthe presence of numerous bones gnawed by hyænas in these caves, that\r\nthe valleys of the Clwyd and the Elwy were the favourite haunts of that\r\nanimal in the pleistocene age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of South Wales in the counties of Glamorgan and Caermarthen._\r\n\r\nThe earliest cavern explored in South Wales is that of Crawley\r\nRocks,[185] Oxwich Bay, about twelve miles from Swansea. It was\r\ndiscovered in quarrying the mountain limestone in 1792, and contained\r\nthe remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, ox, stag, and hyæna. It was\r\ncompletely destroyed before Dr. Buckland identified these animals in\r\nthe collection of Miss Talbot of Penrice Castle.[186]\r\n\r\nThe line of cliffs, bounding the rocky peninsula of Gower, contains\r\nthe cave of Paviland, described in the seventh chapter (p. 232), as\r\nwell as the group explored by Colonel Wood of Start Hall, from the\r\nyear 1848[187] to the present time, Bacon Hole, Minchin Hole, Bosco’s\r\nDen, Devil’s Hole, Crow Hole, Raven’s Cliff, Spritsail Tor, and Long\r\nHole, which are described by the late Dr. Falconer. The _Rhinoceros\r\nhemitœchus_ was met with in comparative abundance, and in association\r\nwith the woolly rhinoceros, mammoth, and _E. antiquus_. In Bosco’s\r\nDen there were no less than 750 shed antlers of reindeer; and in\r\nLong Hole, many flint-flakes were discovered in 1860 underneath the\r\nstalagmite, and in association with the extinct mammalia, which prove,\r\nas Dr. Falconer points out, that man inhabited that district in the\r\npleistocene age.\r\n\r\nThese caves and fissures were at all levels in the cliff, and in some\r\nthe bottoms were covered with a stratum of marine sand with sea shells,\r\nwhich showed that they had been washed by the sea before they had been\r\nfilled by the ossiferous débris. Most of them had probably been filled\r\nby streams in the same manner as Gailenreuth and Wirksworth. They\r\nabound on the coast merely because a clear section has been worn by the\r\nwaves. A straight cut through the rocks in any part of the district\r\nwould probably show them to occur in equal abundance inland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves in Pembrokeshire._\r\n\r\nThe patches of limestone on the opposite side of Caermarthen Bay, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Tenby, also contain ossiferous caverns. The Rev.\r\nG. N. Smith,[188] of Gumfriston, has made a fine collection of bones\r\nand teeth of mammoth and hyæna, from a fissure in the Blackrock Quarry,\r\nclose to Tenby, from a fissure in the cliff on Caldy Island, and from\r\nthe Coygan cave in an outlier of limestone, near Pendine, and has\r\ndiscovered flakes of flint and of a peculiar hornstone in the “tunnel\r\ncave” termed the Hoyle, underneath stalagmite, in a stratum containing\r\nbones of the bear and reindeer. With the exception of the fissure in\r\nthe Blackrock Quarry none of these have been fully explored. On a visit\r\nto Tenby, in 1872, I obtained many flint flakes, and bones broken by\r\nman, from the breccia in the Hoyle; and from a fissure on Caldy Island,\r\nnumerous bones and teeth of young wolves, which represented a whole\r\nlitter, and two metatarsals of bison, cemented together into a compact\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, Irish elk, bison, wolf,\r\nlion, and bear, on so small an island as Caldy, indicates that a\r\nconsiderable change has taken place in the relation of the land to\r\nthe sea in that district since those animals were alive. It would have\r\nbeen impossible for so many and so large animals to have obtained\r\nfood on so small an island. It may therefore be reasonably concluded\r\nthat, when they perished in the fissures, Caldy was not an island, but\r\na precipitous hill, overlooking the broad valley now covered by the\r\nwaters of the Bristol Channel, but then affording abundant pasture. The\r\nsame inference may also be drawn from the vast numbers of animals found\r\nin the Gower caves, which could not have been supported by the scant\r\nherbage of the limestone hills of that district. We must, therefore,\r\npicture to ourselves a fertile plain occupying the whole of the Bristol\r\nChannel, and supporting herds of reindeer, horses, and bisons, many\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses, and now and then being traversed by a stray\r\nhippopotamus, which would afford abundant prey to the lions, bears, and\r\nhyænas inhabiting all the accessible caves, as well as to their great\r\nenemy and destroyer man. We shall see in the ninth chapter that the\r\nelevation of the whole district above its present level is part of the\r\ngeneral elevation of north-western Europe, and no mere small or local\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave in Monmouthshire._\r\n\r\nKing Arthur’s cave,[189] on the side of a beautifully wooded knoll,\r\noverlooking the valley of the Wye, near Whitchurch, in Monmouthshire,\r\nexplored by the Rev. W. S. Symonds in 1871, is a hyæna den, like that\r\nof Kirkdale, containing the gnawed remains of the lion, Irish elk,\r\nmammoth, woolly rhinoceros, and reindeer. Flint flakes, however,\r\noccurred in the undisturbed strata, which prove that it was also the\r\nresort of man. Mr. Symonds believes that the sand and gravel inside\r\nwere deposited by the Wye, at a time when it flowed 300 feet above its\r\npresent course, or before the valley was cut down to that depth. If\r\nthis conclusion be true, the date of the occupation must be separated\r\nfrom the present day by a vast interval, which is only to be measured\r\nby the subsequent erosion of the valley by the slow operation of the\r\nsubaerial agents, running water, ice, snow, and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe only remains of the mammoth which I have examined belong to young\r\nindividuals, and consist of the second and third milk-molars, a fact\r\nwhich I have very generally observed in hyænas’ dens. The older\r\nmammoths would not fall an easy prey to so cowardly an animal. The cave\r\nhad also been inhabited by man after the pleistocene age, for coarse\r\npottery of the neolithic kind, and flint flakes, were dug out of an\r\nupper stratum, while I was watching the excavation, in company with the\r\nRev. W. S. Symonds, and the “Wanderers” field club.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of Gloucestershire and Somersetshire._\r\n\r\nThe outliers of mountain limestone, on the southern side of the\r\nBristol Channel, have long been known for their ossiferous caverns and\r\nfissures. From a fissure in Durdham Down,[190] near Bristol, Mr. J. S.\r\nMiller obtained fragments of bones, about the year 1820, and among them\r\nDr. Buckland notices the fossil joint of the hind-leg of a horse, the\r\nastragalus being held in natural position, between the tibia and the\r\ncalcaneum, by stalagmite. Subsequently a large series of animals of the\r\nsame species as those of Gower were discovered in it by Mr. Stutchbury,\r\nand are preserved in the Bristol Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of the Mendip Hills._\r\n\r\nThe caves of the Mendip Hills were known to contain bones as early as\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, when that of Hutton,[191] near\r\nWeston-super-Mare, was discovered in working the ochre and calamine\r\nwhich fills some of the fissures. The miners having opened an ochre\r\npit, south of the little village of Hutton, discovered a fissure in\r\nthe limestone full of good ochre, which they followed to a depth\r\nof eight yards, until it led into a cavern, the floor of which was\r\nformed of ochre, with large quantities of white bones on the surface,\r\nand scattered through its mass. Dr. Calcott describes the bones as\r\nprojecting from the sides, roof, and floor of the excavation in such\r\nquantities as to resemble the contents of a charnel-house. Subsequently\r\nit was fully explored by the Rev. D. Williams, and Mr. Beard, of\r\nBanwell.\r\n\r\nWe owe the exploration of the neighbouring caves of Banwell, Sandford\r\nHill, Bleadon, Goat’s Hole, in Burrington Combe, and Uphill,[192] to\r\nthe joint labours of the two above-mentioned gentlemen, extending over\r\nthe period which elapsed between 1821 and 1860. The vast quantity of\r\nremains which they obtained can only be realized by a visit to the\r\nMuseum of the Somerset Archæological and Natural History Society,\r\nat Taunton.[193] They belong to the same species as those already\r\nmentioned from the caves of South Wales. The fauna of the Mendip is,\r\nhowever, characterized by the great number of lions, and by a few\r\nfragments of the glutton. Of the former animal, Mr. Ayshford Sanford\r\nand myself have met with sufficient remains to figure nearly every\r\nportion of the skeleton, and the skulls prove that it was not a tiger,\r\nas it is considered to be by some naturalists, but a true lion,\r\ndiffering in no respect, except in its large size, from those now\r\nliving in Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nAll these caverns consist of chambers at various levels more or less\r\nconnected with fissures, and, from the perfect condition of the bones\r\nthey must have been inaccessible to the bone-destroying hyæna. Their\r\ncontents were introduced, as is suggested by Dr. Buckland, from the\r\nsurface by streams falling into swallow-holes (see Fig. 81), which have\r\nnow, under the changed physical conditions, ceased to flow.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary quantity of remains preserved in one cave may be, to\r\nsome extent, verified by a visit to that at Banwell. It consists of two\r\nlarge chambers, the upper one filled with thousands of bones of bison,\r\nhorse, and reindeer, taken out of the red silt which originally filled\r\nit to the roof; the lower one full of the undisturbed contents, from\r\nwhich the bones project in the wildest confusion. This accumulation\r\nhas been introduced by water, through a vertical fissure which opened\r\non the surface. It is evident, from the very nearly perfect skulls of\r\nwolf and bear which were discovered, that the cave was not used as a\r\nden by the hyænas. They are, however, proved to have been living close\r\nby at the time, since their skulls, and the gnawed antlers of reindeer,\r\nhave been discovered inside. They were probably swept in by the stream\r\nalong with the other bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Uphill Cave._\r\n\r\nThe Cave of Uphill,[194] discovered in 1826, by some workmen, and\r\nexplored by the Rev. D. Williams, merits especial notice, from the\r\npeculiar conditions under which the remains of the extinct animals\r\noccurred. Like the other caves of the Mendips, it consists of fissures\r\nopening into chambers. In the upper part of one of these fissures were\r\nthe remains of rhinoceros, hyæna, bear, horse, bison, and wild boar,\r\nimbedded in loam which rested on two large masses of limestone that had\r\nfallen so as to block up the fissure. Below this were no remains of the\r\nextinct animals, and the fissure ultimately led into a cave opening\r\nupon the line of cliffs. This latter had been inhabited within historic\r\ntimes, since many bones of sheep, or goat, and pieces of pottery, were\r\nmet with, as well as a coin of the Emperor Julian. In this case, owing\r\nto the extraordinary accident of the fissure being blocked up by a\r\nfall of stone, the pleistocene accumulation is vertically above the\r\nhistoric; and had the barrier given way, Mr. Williams would undoubtedly\r\nhave discovered the remains of the extinct mammalia, lying in a heap\r\nabove the comparatively modern historic stratum. It seems to me very\r\nprobable that some such accident may have caused the occurrence of\r\nthe pleiocene machairodus in the Kent’s Hole cavern, in association\r\nwith the pleistocene mammalia. In the long lapse of ages between the\r\npleistocene and the present day, such accidents would be likely to\r\noccur in some few caverns, and we might expect to find remains of\r\nwidely different ages, in certain exceptional cases, lying side by\r\nside, or even the older resting vertically over the newer. At all\r\nevents we must conclude, that superposition, or association, cannot be\r\nrigidly enforced as tests of relative age in all ossiferous caverns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Hyæna-den of Wookey Hole._\r\n\r\nThe Hyæna-den of Wookey Hole,[195] near Wells, on the south side of\r\nthe Mendips, which I explored with the Rev. J. Williamson in 1859,\r\nand in the following years with Messrs. Willett, Parker, and Ayshford\r\nSanford, is worthy of a more detailed notice, because it was among\r\nthe first caverns in this country in which works of art were found\r\nunder conditions that proved the co-existence of man with the extinct\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nThe ravine in which it was discovered, in 1852, is one of the many\r\nwhich pierce the dolomitic conglomerate, or petrified sea-beach, of\r\nthe Triassic age, resting at the foot of the cliffs from which it\r\nwas torn by the waves, and overlying the lower slopes of the Mendips\r\n(see Fig. 1). Open to the south, it runs almost horizontally into the\r\nmountain-side, until closed abruptly northwards by a perpendicular\r\nwall of rock, 200 feet or more in height, ivy-covered, and affording\r\na dwelling-place to innumerable jackdaws. Out of a cave at its base,\r\nin which Dr. Buckland discovered pottery and human teeth, flows the\r\nriver Axe, in a canal cut in the rock. In cutting this passage, that\r\nthe water might be conveyed to a large paper-mill close by, the mouth\r\nof the hyæna-den was intersected in 1852, and from that time up to\r\nDecember 1859 it was undisturbed save by rabbits and badgers, and even\r\nthey did not penetrate far into the interior, or make deep burrows.\r\nClose to the mouth of the cave the workmen (employed in making this\r\ncanal) found more than 300 Roman coins, among which were those of\r\nAllectus and of Commodus. When the Rev. J. Williamson and myself began\r\nour exploration, about twelve feet of the entrance of the cave had been\r\ncut away, and large quantities of the earth, stones, and animal remains\r\nhad been used in the formation of an embankment for the stream which\r\nruns past the present entrance of the cave.\r\n\r\nAccording to the testimony of the workmen, the bones and teeth formed\r\na layer about twelve inches in thickness, which rested immediately\r\nupon the conglomerate-floor, while they were comparatively scarce in\r\nthe overlying mass of stones and red earth. The workmen state also\r\nthat at the time of the discovery of the cave the hillside presented\r\nno concavity to mark its presence. So completely was the cave filled\r\nwith débris up to the very roof, that we were compelled to cut our way\r\ninto it. Of the stones scattered irregularly through the matrix of\r\nred earth, some were angular, others water-worn; all are derived from\r\nthe decomposition of the dolomitic conglomerate in which the cave is\r\nhollowed. Near the entrance, and at a depth of five feet from the roof,\r\nwere three layers of peroxide of manganese, full of bony splinters,\r\nand, passing obliquely up towards the southern side of the cave and\r\nover a ledge of rock that rises abruptly from the floor: further\r\ninwards they became interblended one with another, and at a distance\r\nof fifteen feet from the entrance were barely visible. In and between\r\nthese the animal remains were found in the greatest abundance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Plan of Hyæna-den at Wookey Hole.\r\n\r\nRight lines = sections; dotted areas = bone-beds; shaded areas = ashes\r\nand implements.]\r\n\r\nWhile cutting our way inwards (Figs. 83 and 88), we found an angular\r\npiece of flint, which had evidently been chipped by human agency, and\r\na water-worn fragment of a belemnite, which probably had been derived\r\nfrom the neighbouring marlstone rocks. Bones and teeth of the woolly\r\nrhinoceros, reindeer, stag, Irish elk, mammoth, hyæna, cave-bear,\r\nlion, wolf, fox, and horse rewarded our labours; and frogs’ remains,\r\ncemented together by stalagmite, were abundant at the mouth. The teeth\r\npreponderated greatly over the bones, and the great bulk were those of\r\nthe horse. The hyæna-teeth also were very numerous, and in all stages\r\nof growth, from the young unworn to the old tooth worn down to the\r\nvery gums. Those of the mammoth had belonged to a young animal, and\r\none had not been used at all. The hollow bones were completely smashed\r\nand splintered, and scored with tooth-marks, while the solid carpal,\r\ntarsal, and sesamoid bones were uninjured, as in the Kirkdale Cave. The\r\norganic remains were in all stages of decay, some crumbling to dust\r\nat the touch, while others were perfectly preserved and had lost very\r\nlittle of their gelatine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 84, 85, 86, 87.--Four Views of Flint Implements\r\nfound in the Hyæna-den at Wookey Hole, near Wells.]\r\n\r\nIn 1860 we resumed our excavations; and, in addition to the above\r\nremains, found satisfactory evidence of the former presence of man in\r\nthe cave. Our search was rewarded by one oval implement of white flint,\r\nof rude workmanship (Figs. 84, 85, 86, 87), one chert arrow-head,\r\na roughly-chipped and a round flattened piece of chert, together\r\nwith various splinters of flint, which had apparently been knocked\r\noff in the manufacture of some implement. Two rudely-fashioned bone\r\narrow-heads were also found, which unfortunately were subsequently lost\r\nby the photographer to whom they were sent; they resembled in shape an\r\nequilateral triangle with the angles at the base bevelled off. All were\r\nfound in and around the same spot, in contact with some hyæna-teeth,\r\nbetween the dark bands of manganese, at a depth of four feet from the\r\nroof, and at a distance of twelve feet from the present entrance (Fig.\r\n83, _a_).\r\n\r\nThat there might be no mistake about the accuracy of the observations,\r\nI examined every shovelful of débris as it was thrown out by the\r\nworkman; while the exact spot where they were excavating was watched by\r\nmy colleague. The figured implement was picked out of the undisturbed\r\nmatrix by him; the rest were found by me in the earth thrown out from\r\nthe same place.\r\n\r\nThe lines of peroxide of manganese must have been accumulated on the\r\nold floors of the cave, because they were associated with numerous\r\nsplinters and gnawed animal remains; and there can be no doubt that the\r\nlatter were introduced by the hyænas. Those animals have a peculiar\r\nhabit, as Dr. Buckland proved by experiment, of gnawing similar bones\r\nin precisely the same way; and a comparison of the relics of the\r\nmeals of the hyænas in the Zoological Gardens with those in the cave,\r\nshows that the latter have passed between the jaws of a like animal\r\nthat once inhabited Somersetshire. Coprolites of the same animal were\r\nvery abundant, and in some places formed a greyish-white layer of\r\nphosphate of lime. There were also other equally unmistakeable traces\r\nof the animal in fragments of bone, polished by their tread, as in the\r\nKirkdale cave. It is, therefore, only reasonable to suppose that these\r\nremains of animals were brought into the cave from time to time by\r\nhyænas, and left on the floors. That they were not introduced by water\r\nis proved by the preservation of the delicate processes and points of\r\nbone, which would certainly have been broken _in transitu_. Since,\r\nthen, the implements, which, beyond doubt, had been fashioned by man,\r\nwere underneath one of these old floors, it was certain that man was\r\ncontemporary in the district with the hyæna and the animals on which it\r\npreyed, and the fact that they were found only on one spot implies that\r\nthey were deposited by the hand of man. To suppose that a savage would\r\ntake the trouble to excavate a trench twenty-four feet long--for twelve\r\nfeet of the former mouth of the cave had been cut away--with miserable\r\nimplements, and consequently with great labour, and having excavated\r\nit again to fill it up to the very roof, is little less than absurd.\r\nNor could such an operation take place in such a deposit, without the\r\nstratification of the layers being destroyed. The absence of pottery\r\nand human bones precludes the idea of the cave ever having been a place\r\nof sepulture, such as Aurignac or Bruniquel. This discovery, therefore,\r\nof itself stamps the contemporaneity of man with the extinct mammalia,\r\nand following close on the similar discoveries in Brixham cave, to be\r\nmentioned presently, puts the question beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nIn April 1861 we resumed our excavations; and, as we made our way\r\ninwards, found that the cave began to narrow, and ultimately to\r\nbifurcate, one branch extending vertically upwards, while the other\r\nappeared to extend almost horizontally to the right hand. As we reached\r\nthe middle constricted passage, the teeth became fewer, while the\r\nstones were of larger size than any that we had hitherto discovered.\r\nThe great majority of the gnawed antlers of deer were found at this\r\npart, also the posterior half of a cervine skull, the right upper jaw\r\nof wolf, and, what is more remarkable, a stone with one of its surfaces\r\ncoated with a deposit apparently of stalagmite: this, however, was much\r\nlighter than stalagmite, and not so good a conductor of heat; and,\r\non analysis, I found that it consisted of phosphate of lime, with a\r\nlittle carbonate, and a very small portion of peroxide of manganese.\r\nDoubtless the surface of the stone, covered with phosphate of lime,\r\nformed part of the ancient floor of the cave, and hence was coated with\r\n_album græcum_; while the lower part, being imbedded in the earth on\r\nthe floor, was not so coated. This deposit may, perhaps, explain the\r\nabsence of round balls of coprolite, which, assuming that the cave at\r\nthe time was more damp than that at Kirkdale, would be trodden down\r\non the floor by the hyænas, instead of presenting a rounded form. The\r\nstone also itself exhibits tooth-marks underneath the coating of _album\r\ngræcum_, and probably was gnawed by the hyænas, like the antlers, for\r\namusement. This discovery proves that violent watery action had but\r\nsmall share, if any, in filling the cave; for in that case the soft\r\ncovering would have been removed from the stone. Similar evidence is\r\noffered by the wonderful preservation of some of the more delicate\r\nfragments of bone, such as the palatine process of the maxilla of the\r\nwolf.\r\n\r\nThe section made in cutting this passage presented irregular layers of\r\nperoxide of manganese, full of bony splinters, and each more or less\r\ncovered by a layer of bones in various stages of decay. These layers\r\nwere absent from the upper portion of the passage. There were masses\r\nof prisms of calc-spar scattered confusedly through the matrix. After\r\nexcavating the vertical branch as far as we dared (for the large stones\r\nin it made the task dangerous), we were compelled to leave off, having\r\npenetrated altogether only thirty-four feet from the entrance. No flint\r\nimplements rewarded our search this year. Teeth were far more numerous\r\nthan bones, probably because they are more durable as well as because\r\nof their rejection by the hyænas. One jaw was bitten in two, and the\r\nfragments found about a foot apart in the undisturbed matrix, just as\r\nthey had been dropped from the mouth of the hyæna.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1862 Mr. Parker, Mr. Willett, and myself resolved\r\nto verify the association of articles of man’s handiwork along with\r\nthe extinct mammalia, by cleaning out the cave, which was courteously\r\nplaced at our disposal by the owner, Mr. Hodgekinson.\r\n\r\nOur first task was to clear the contents out of the portion of the cave\r\nnearest the mouth, or the antrum (Fig. 83, A), and as we excavated\r\nonwards many traces of the presence of man were met with. A wide area\r\non the left-hand side (_b_), where the roof and floor of the cave\r\ngradually met together, furnished innumerable fragments of charcoal,\r\nand many flint implements associated with the remains of the horse,\r\nrhinoceros, and hyæna. One fragment of bone in particular, belonging to\r\nthe rhinoceros, had been calcined, and its carbonized condition bore\r\nunmistakeable testimony that it had been burnt while the animal juices\r\nwere present. There were many other bones also burnt, which indicated\r\nthe place where fires had been kindled, and food cooked. As we dug our\r\nway forward we met with a third area (_c_), that furnished flint and\r\nchert implements under the same conditions of deposit as that which\r\ntempted us to carry on our excavations. Its relation to the old floors\r\nof hyæna-occupation is shown by the dark lines over the area _c_ in\r\nFig. 88. At last the large open chamber (A) was cleared; it measured\r\nabout thirty feet wide by six feet high, and it extended forty feet\r\ninwards. On the left there was a small upward-turning passage, very\r\nnearly blocked up with a mass of stalagmite; at the farther end a\r\nvertical fissure extended upwards (F), to the surface. This fissure\r\nhas subsequently been proved to extend downwards to the right, and\r\nwill doubtless furnish large quantities of animal remains to future\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Section through A of Fig. 83, showing contents\r\nof Hyæna-den. _c_ = flint implements; thick lines above = old floors.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Transverse Section through B of Fig. 83. 1 =\r\nred earth; 2 = bone-bed; 3 = dark earth.]\r\n\r\nThe large chamber now turned abruptly to the left, and we gradually\r\nworked our way into a small horizontal passage about four feet high.\r\nHere there was an interval of from three to four inches between the\r\nroof and contents, traversed by stalactites, which in some places\r\nformed a smooth undulating drapery with stony tassels, and in others\r\ntiny pillars extending down to the débris, and, as it were, propping\r\nup the roof. These pedestals (see Fig. 15) gradually expanded into\r\nround plates of stalagmite, which sometimes met and formed a continuous\r\ncrust. In some places an infiltration of carbonate of lime had\r\ncemented organic remains, stones, and earth into a hard mass, which had\r\nto be broken up with gunpowder before it could be removed out of the\r\ncave. The excitement of extracting from these blocks their treasures\r\nwas of the very keenest, for we could not tell what a stroke of the\r\nhammer would reveal. Sometimes an elephant’s tooth suddenly came to\r\nlight, at others a hyæna’s jaw, or a rhinoceros’ tooth, or the antler\r\nof a reindeer, or the canine of a bear. The bones were so numerous that\r\nthey scarcely attracted attention. In one fragment of this breccia, now\r\nin the Brighton Museum, are a tusk and carpal of mammoth, the right\r\nulna of the woolly rhinoceros, and an antler of reindeer. In a second,\r\ntwo shoulder-blades and two haunch bones of the woolly rhinoceros, with\r\na coprolite and lower jaw of cave hyæna. As the men removed the large\r\nblocks they were brought to the mouth of the cave to be broken up by\r\nour smaller instruments. Presently the passage narrowed to about six\r\nfeet, and presented the following section (Fig. 89). On the floor of\r\nthe cave there was a layer of red earth two feet in thickness, and, as\r\nusual, containing a few organic remains and many stones (Fig. 89, 1).\r\nUpon this rested a most remarkable accumulation of bones, and teeth,\r\nmatted and compacted together, from three to four inches thick, and\r\nextending horizontally from one side of the passage to the other (Fig.\r\n89, 2). Next came a layer of dark red earth (Fig. 89, 3), loose and\r\nfriable, three to four inches thick, supporting in its surface a few\r\nrounded stalagmites, and a few stalactitic pillars, that spanned the\r\ninterval of from three to four inches between it and the roof. This\r\nbone-bed was about seven feet wide and fourteen feet long, affording,\r\ntherefore, a square area of ninety-eight feet (see dotted area B Fig.\r\n83, and in Fig. 90). The enormous quantity of the remains of animals\r\npresent cannot fairly be estimated even by the large number preserved,\r\nbecause most of the bones were as soft as wet mortar. The five hundred\r\nand fifty specimens obtained must be looked upon merely as a small\r\nfraction of the whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Longitudinal Section through B and C of Fig.\r\n83, showing bone-beds. Dotted area = bone-bed.]\r\n\r\nWe presently passed beyond the bone-bed, and found that the passage\r\nbifurcated (Fig. 83, C and D), the smaller branch going straight\r\nforwards and gently upwards (Fig. 90), while the larger stretched\r\nat right angles from it and passed gently downwards. In the former\r\nthere was a second bone-bed similar in every respect to that already\r\ndescribed, which continued undiminished in thickness until it rested\r\ndirectly on the floor. It afforded a square area of about fifteen\r\nfeet. The passage was about sixteen inches high and three feet wide,\r\nand gradually narrowed until at a distance of twelve feet from the\r\nbifurcation a stalactite six inches long reached the floor and formed\r\na vertical bar, as if to forbid another ingress. When this had been\r\nexplored as far as we could crawl, the larger branch (Fig. 83, D,\r\nand Fig. 91) engaged our attention, and we soon discovered a third\r\nlayer of bones of the same character as the others, and in the same\r\nposition, excepting that in some places it was in immediate contact\r\nwith the roof. In width it was six, in length fourteen, and in square\r\narea eighty-four feet. From its further end to the termination of the\r\npassage there was not the slightest vestige of bones or teeth, and a\r\nstiff grey clay rested on a horizontal layer of sand on the floor. Here\r\nthe passage suddenly turned upwards until it became so small and barren\r\nthat it was not worth our while to pursue it farther. It doubtless\r\nrises to the surface, like the large fissure opposite the entrance of\r\nthe cave shown in Fig. 88.[196]\r\n\r\nThe exploration was resumed the following year by Mr. Ayshford Sanford\r\nand myself, and yielded vast quantities of fossil remains. We cleared\r\nout the space marked 1863 in the plan, and discovered a flint implement\r\nat the point marked _d_, in Fig. 83. My friend the late Mr. Wickham\r\nFlower has also worked the cave, more particularly at the right-hand\r\nside of the entrance chamber.\r\n\r\nThe ashes and implements were found in positions, near the mouth of\r\nthe cave, where man himself may have placed them (see Figs. 83, 88),\r\nwith the exception of the flint implement at _d_, and an ash of bone\r\nimbedded in the earthy matrix between the canine tooth and a coprolite\r\nof the hyæna, and cemented to a fragment of dolomitic conglomerate.\r\nThis was found far in the cave, either at the entrance of the passage\r\nB, or in the middle of the passage D. The latter passage yielded the\r\nonly rolled flint without traces of man’s handiwork. The materials\r\nout of which the implements were made were used pretty equally. All\r\nthose, like Fig. 84, were of flint; all those chipped into a rounded\r\nform and flat-oval in section of chert from the Upper Greensand; while\r\nthe flakes consisted of both used indifferently. Besides these three\r\ntypical forms, which were most abundant, is a fourth, in form roughly\r\npyramidal, with a smooth and flat base, and a cutting edge all round.\r\nOf these we found but two examples, both consisting of chert. In form\r\nthey are exactly similar to several hundreds found in a British village\r\nat Stanlake, in Berkshire, and to those I discovered in a cemetery of\r\nthe same age at Yarnton, near Oxford. They strongly resemble a cast I\r\nhave of one found by M. Lartet in the cave of Aurignac. Were it not for\r\nthis similarity, I should look upon them as cores from which flakes\r\nhad been struck. The rest are mere splinters, irregular in form,\r\nand probably made in the manufacture of the various flint and chert\r\nimplements. All the flint implements have been altered in colour and\r\nstructure, either by heat or, as is more probable, by some chemical\r\naction. Without exception, the old surfaces present a waxy lustre (by\r\nthe absence of which forgeries are easily detected), the colour is of\r\na uniform milk-white, and the ordinary conchoidal fracture is replaced\r\nby that of porcelain. Some are not harder than chalk. I have met with\r\nweathered and calcined flints in Sussex in which similar changes are\r\nobservable, and in which the difference in the results of chemical\r\naction and heat can hardly be detected. The chert implements, on the\r\nother hand, show no traces of any such changes, but are similar in\r\ncolour and structure to the rocks from which they came--the Upper\r\nGreensand of the Blackdown Hills.\r\n\r\nAll the fragments of calcined bone, with the exception of one already\r\nmentioned, were found near the entrance (see Fig. 83, _b_), and in\r\na place more suitable for a fire than any other in the cave. I can\r\nidentify none of them as human. The coarse texture, the structure,\r\nand the thickness of one indicate a fragment of a long bone of\r\nthe rhinoceros.[197] All resemble many splinters strewn about in\r\nother parts of the cave, which are not calcined, but were evidently\r\nintroduced by the hyænas. The calcination may therefore be due to the\r\naccident of their lying upon the surface at the time the fire was\r\nkindled.\r\n\r\nThe remains obtained in 1862-3 from three to four thousand in number,\r\nafford a vivid picture of the animal life of the time in Somerset. They\r\nbelong to the following animals, the numbers representing the jaws and\r\nteeth only, and the implements:--\r\n\r\n  Man                            35\r\n  Cave-Hyæna                    467\r\n  Cave-Lion                      15\r\n  Cave-Bear                      27\r\n  Grizzly Bear                   11\r\n  Brown Bear                     11\r\n  Wolf                            7\r\n  Fox                             8\r\n  Mammoth                        30\r\n  Woolly Rhinoceros             233\r\n  _Rhinoceros hemitœchus_         2\r\n  Horse                         401\r\n  The Great Urus                 16\r\n  Bison                          30\r\n  The Irish Elk                  35\r\n  Reindeer                       30\r\n  Red Deer                        2\r\n  Lemming                         1\r\n\r\nThe remains of these animals were so intermingled that they must have\r\nbeen living together at the same time. They lie large with small, the\r\nmore with the less dense, and are not in the least degree sorted by\r\nwater. There is no evidence of the hyæna succeeding to the cave-bear,\r\nor the reindeer to the urus, or that the bears came here to die, as in\r\nsome of the German caves, or that the herbivores fell, or were swept\r\ninto open fissures, and left their remains, as in the caves of Hutton\r\nand Plymouth. On the contrary, the numerous jaws and teeth of hyæna,\r\nand the marks of those teeth upon nearly every one of the specimens,\r\nshow that they alone introduced the remains that were found in such\r\nabundance. And they preyed not merely upon horses, uri, and other\r\nherbivores, but upon one another (Figs. 92, 93), and they even overcame\r\nthe cave-bear and lion in their full prime. Some of the bones of the\r\nlarger animals, and in particular a leg-bone of a gigantic urus, have\r\nbeen broken short across and not bitten through--a circumstance which\r\npoints towards one of the causes of the vast accumulation of bones\r\nin so small a cave. It is well known that wolves and hyænas at the\r\npresent day are in the habit of hunting in packs, and of forcing their\r\nprey over precipices. The Wookey ravine is admirably situated for this\r\nmode of hunting, and would not fail to destroy any animal forced into\r\nit from the hill-side. It is therefore very probable that the hyænas\r\nsometimes caught their prey in this manner. They would not have dared\r\nto attack the bears and lions unless these had been disabled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Longitudinal Section through D of Fig. 83.\r\nDotted area = bone-bed.]\r\n\r\nBut if all the remains of the animals were introduced by the hyænas,\r\nthey certainly in some cases do not occupy the exact position in which\r\nthey were left by those animals. One of the bone layers (Fig. 91) for\r\ninstance, actually touched the roof. This, indeed, has been used as\r\nan argument in favour of their having been introduced by water, from\r\nsome unknown repository. But if this hypothesis be admitted, we are\r\nlanded in the following dilemma: either the introducing current of\r\nwater must have passed down the vertical passages, or upwards through\r\nthe horizontal mouth of the cave. In the former case the three bone\r\nlayers would not have been found in the narrow passages, but would\r\nhave been swept out into the wide chamber, where the force of the\r\nhypothetical current must have abated. In the latter case the great\r\nbulk of the remains would have been found in the chamber, and not in\r\nthe smaller passages. Moreover, the absence of marks of transport by\r\nwater, and especially of that sorting action which water as a conveying\r\nagent always manifests, renders the view of their being so introduced\r\nuntenable. On the other hand, the horizontality of the layers of bone,\r\nand the presence of sand and of red earth, imply that water was an\r\nagent in re-arranging the bones and in introducing some of the contents\r\nof the cave. The only solution of the difficulty that I can hazard is\r\nthe occurrence of floods from time to time, during the occupation of\r\nthe hyænas, similar to those which now take place in the caverns of the\r\nneighbourhood. A few years ago, the outlet of the Axe in the great cave\r\nwas partially blocked up, and the water rose to a height of upwards of\r\nsixteen feet, leaving a horizontal deposit of red earth of the same\r\nnature as that in the hyæna-den. Now if we suppose that similar floods\r\nwere caused by an obstruction in the ravine below the hyæna-den, it\r\nmay have been flooded, just as the upper galleries of the great cave,\r\nand the water laden with sediment might have elevated the layers of\r\nmatted bone, and some of the scattered remains on the surface, while\r\nthe current was insufficient to disturb the stones, or to affect to\r\nany extent the deposits of former floods. The buoyancy of the organic\r\nremains is not required to be greater, on this hypothesis, than in\r\nthat of their having been introduced by a current through the vertical\r\npassages. Some of the wet bones taken straight from the cave were\r\nsufficiently light to be carried down by the current of the Axe.\r\n\r\nAll these facts taken together enable us to form a clear idea of\r\nthe condition of things at the time the hyæna-den was inhabited.\r\nThe hyænas were the normal occupants of the cave, and thither they\r\nbrought their prey. We can realize those animals pursuing elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses along the slopes of the Mendip, till they scared them into\r\nthe precipitous ravine, or watching until the strength of a disabled\r\nbear or lion ebbed away sufficiently to allow of its being overcome by\r\ntheir cowardly strength. Man appeared from time to time on the scene,\r\na miserable savage armed with bow and spear, unacquainted with metals,\r\nbut defended from the cold by coats of skin.[198] Sometimes he took\r\npossession of the den and drove out the hyænas; for it is impossible\r\nfor both to have lived in the same cave at the same time. He kindled\r\nhis fires at the entrance, to cook his food, and to keep away the wild\r\nanimals; then he went away, and the hyænas came to their old abode.\r\nWhile all this was taking place there were floods from time to time\r\nuntil eventually the cave was completely blocked up with their deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Gnawed jaw of Hyæna, from Hyæna-den at Wookey\r\n(1/2). Dotted outline = portion eaten.]\r\n\r\nThe winter cold at the time must have been very severe to admit of the\r\npresence of the reindeer and lemming.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The district of the Mendip Hills at a higher level than now._\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the vast quantities of the remains of the animals\r\nburied in the caves of so limited an area as the Mendip Hills, it is\r\nevident that there must have been abundance of food to have enabled\r\nthem to live in the district. The great marsh now extending from Wells\r\nto the sea, and cutting off the Mendips from the fertile region to the\r\nsouth, was probably a rich valley at a higher level than at present,\r\njoining the westward plains now submerged under the Bristol Channel. An\r\nelevation of from 100 to 300 feet would produce the physical conditions\r\nnecessary for the sustenance of the herbivora found in the caves both\r\nin South Wales and Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The characters of a Hyæna-den._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--A and B, upper and lower jaws of Hyæna-whelp,\r\nWookey.]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the animals which have been eaten by the cave-hyæna,\r\nmay be recognized by the following characters. All are more or less\r\nscored by teeth, and the only perfect bones are those which are solid,\r\nor of very dense texture. The skulls are represented merely by the\r\nharder portions. That of the woolly rhinoceros, for example, by the\r\nhard pedestal which supports the anterior horn (see Fig. 30). Several\r\nof these pedestals occurred in the Wookey hyæna-den. The lower jaws\r\nalso have lost their angle and coronoid process, and are gnawed to\r\nthe pattern of the shaded portion of Fig. 92, the less succulent part\r\nbearing the teeth being rejected. This holds good of the jaws of all\r\nthe animals so persistently, that out of more than two hundred from\r\nWookey there was only one exception. The jaw of the glutton (Fig. 82),\r\nfrom Plas Heaton, is also gnawed to the same shape, and one of those\r\nof the cave-bear from the cavern of Lherm, considered by M. Garrigou\r\nto have been fashioned by the hand of man into an implement, seems to\r\nme, after a careful comparison in company with Dr. Falconer, referable\r\nsolely to the gnawing of the hyæna. In Fig. 92, the lower jaw of an\r\nadult hyæna is represented, and in Fig. 93 (1) the upper and lower\r\njaws of a hyæna-whelp. In the latter the teeth marks _a_ and _b_ are\r\nremarkably distinct.[199]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Left Thigh-bone of Woolly Rhinoceros gnawed by\r\nHyænas; Shaded parts left. (Wookey Hole.)]\r\n\r\nThe marrow-containing bones are also universally splintered away,\r\nuntil either the articular ends alone are left, as in Fig. 80, or in\r\nsome cases, as in that of the femur of woolly rhinoceros (Fig. 94),\r\nthe dense central portion bearing the third trochanter is preserved.\r\nThis fragment is extremely abundant in nearly all the hyæna-caves in\r\nthis country. From the invariable habit of the hyæna leaving the bones\r\nof its prey in fragments of this kind, their dens are characterized\r\nby the absence of perfect long-bones and skulls, and consequently,\r\nwhen these occur in a cave it is certain proof that it was not\r\noccupied by these animals. In a great many caves, however, the gnawed\r\nfragments are associated with the perfect bones, as, for example, at\r\nBanwell, a circumstance that may be accounted for by the untouched\r\ncarcases and the gnawed fragments being swept in from the surface by a\r\nstream falling into a swallow-hole. In all hyæna-dens also are large\r\nquantities of _album græcum_, as well as fragments of bone more or less\r\npolished by the friction of the hyæna’s feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Devonshire._\r\n\r\nThe ossiferous caves on the south coast of Devonshire, explored during\r\nthe last fifty years, are by far the most important in this country,\r\nsince they were the first which were scientifically examined, and\r\nthe first which established the co-existence of man with the extinct\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nWe owe the full details of their history to the labours of the\r\ndistinguished cave-hunter Mr. Pengelly, F.R.S.,[200] whose writings are\r\nfreely used in the following account.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Oreston Caves._\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of the presence of fossil bones in the district\r\nwas furnished by Mr. Whidbey, the engineer in charge of the\r\nconstruction of the Plymouth breakwater, who discovered numerous\r\nbones and teeth, imbedded in clayey loam, in some cavernous fissures\r\nat Oreston, which were brought before the Royal Society by Sir\r\nEverard Home in 1817. Thus Dr. Buckland’s researches in Kirkdale were\r\nanticipated by four years. From time to time, since that date, several\r\nother fissures and caves close by have furnished remains of rhinoceros,\r\nmammoth, hyæna, lion, and other animals. Among the bones and teeth\r\noriginally sent up by Mr. Whidbey are several which were identified by\r\nProf. Busk,[201] as belonging to the _Rhinoceros megarhinus_, a species\r\nthat is vastly abundant in the pleiocene strata of northern Italy and\r\nis also represented in the early pleistocene forest-bed of Norfolk and\r\nSuffolk, and in the lower brickearths of the valley of the Thames at\r\nGrays and Crayford. This is the only case on record of the discovery of\r\nthe animal in a cavern deposit.\r\n\r\nThe cavernous fissures in the neighbourhood of Yealmpton,[202] about\r\nseven miles east-south-east from Plymouth, explored by Mr. Bellamy and\r\nColonel Mudge, R.A., F.R.S. in 1835-6, contained the remains of the\r\nhyæna and rhinoceros, and the other animals more usually associated\r\nwith them. They were probably filled, as in the case of Oreston, mainly\r\nby the streams which introduced the pebbles. They may, however, from\r\ntime to time have been inhabited by the hyænas, although the presence\r\nof three skulls of that animal forbids the supposition that they\r\ndragged in all the fossil bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves at Brixham._\r\n\r\nThe series of fissures accidentally discovered in 1858, in quarrying\r\nthe rock which overlooks the little fishing town of Brixham, known as\r\nthe Windmill cave, was selected by the late Dr. Falconer,[203] as a\r\nspot in which thorough investigation would be likely to decide the then\r\ndoubtful question of the co-existence of man with the extinct mammalia.\r\nKent’s Hole had been disturbed by repeated diggings, and the results\r\nmight be viewed with suspicion. He, therefore, urged the importance of\r\na systematic examination of this virgin cave with such effect, that it\r\nwas undertaken by the Royal and Geological Societies, and a committee\r\nwas appointed, comprising, amongst others, Dr. Falconer, Prof. Ramsay,\r\nMr. Prestwich, Sir Charles Lyell, Prof. Owen, Mr. Godwin-Austen, and\r\nMr. Pengelly. To the superintendence of the last is mainly due the\r\nminute care with which the exploration was conducted. The remains have\r\nbeen identified by Dr. Falconer and Prof. Busk. The work was commenced\r\nin July 1858, and completed in the summer of 1859.[204]\r\n\r\nThe cave consists of three principal galleries, with diverging\r\npassages, running in the direction of the joints from north to south,\r\nand from east to west, communicating with the surface at four points.\r\nThe following is the general section (Fig. 95) of the deposits in\r\ndescending order.\r\n\r\n(A.) On the floor was a layer of stalagmite, varying from a few inches\r\nto upwards of a foot in thickness, and containing only twenty-five\r\nbones, among which were the humerus of a bear, and the antler of a\r\nreindeer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Diagram of Deposits in Brixham Cave.\r\n(Pengelly.)]\r\n\r\n(B.) Reddish cave-earth with fragments and blocks of limestone, and\r\nof stalagmite, generally averaging from two to four feet. In it 1,102\r\nbones were discovered irregularly scattered through its mass, and\r\nbelonging to mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, lion, cave, grizzly, and brown\r\nbears, reindeer, and others. They varied in state of preservation, and\r\nsome were scored and marked by teeth. Associated with these, thirty-six\r\nrude flint implements were met with, of indisputable human workmanship,\r\nand of the same general order as those figured by the Rev. J. MacEnery\r\nfrom Kent’s Hole. Among them was one lanceolate implement with rounded\r\npoint and unworked butt end, considered by Mr. John Evans, F.R.S.,\r\nof the type of those usually found in the valley gravels.[205] There\r\nwas, therefore, the most conclusive evidence that man inhabited the\r\nneighbourhood, either before or during the time of the accumulation of\r\nB, and before those physical changes took place by which the red silt\r\nceased to be deposited, or the stalagmite above began to be formed.\r\n\r\n(C.) At the bottom of the cave-earth was a deposit of gravel,\r\nprincipally of rounded pebbles and devoid of fossils.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the cave, as shown by these deposits, is given\r\nby Mr. Prestwich, in the report presented to the Royal Society, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n“Looking at all the phenomena of Brixham cave, the conclusion your\r\nreporter has arrived at is, that the formation of the cave commenced\r\nand was carried on simultaneously with the excavation of the valley;\r\nthat the small streams flowing down the upper tributary branches of\r\nthe valley entered the western openings of the cave and, traversing\r\nthe fissures in the limestone, escaped by lower openings in the chief\r\nvalley, just as the Grotto d’Arcy was formed by an overflow from the\r\ncave taking a short cut through the limestone hills, round which the\r\nriver winds. These tributary streams brought in the shingle bed (Fig.\r\n95, C), which fills the bottom of the fissure. It was only during\r\noccasional droughts, when the streams were dry, that the cave seems\r\nto have been frequented by animals, their remains being very scarce\r\nin that bed, while indications of man are comparatively numerous. As\r\nthe excavation of the valley proceeded, the level of the stream was\r\nlowered and became more restricted to the valley-channel. The cave\r\nconsequently became drier, and was more resorted to by predatory\r\nanimals, who carried in their prey to devour, and was less frequented\r\nby man. At the same time with the periodical floods, which there is\r\nevery reason to believe, from other investigations, were so great\r\nduring the quaternary period, the cave would long continue to be\r\nsubject to inundations, the muddy waters of which deposited the silt\r\nforming the cave-earth, burying progressively the bones left from\r\nseason to season by succeeding generations of beasts of prey. By the\r\nrepetition at distant intervals of these inundations, and by the\r\naccumulation during the intervening periods of fresh crops of bones,\r\nthe bone-bearing cave-earth, B, was gradually formed. During this time\r\nthe occasional visits of man are indicated by the rare occurrence of\r\na flint implement, lost, probably, as he groped his way through the\r\ndark passages of the cave. As the valley became deeper, and as with the\r\nchange of climate at the close of the (pleistocene) quaternary period\r\nthe floods became less, so did the cave become drier and more resorted\r\nto by animals. At last it seems to have become a place for permanent\r\nresort for bears; their remains in all stages of growth, including\r\neven sucking cubs, were met with in the upper part of the cave-earth,\r\nin greater numbers than were the bones of any other animals. These\r\nanimals resorted especially to the darker and more secluded flint-knife\r\ngallery, where 221 out of 366 of their determinable bones were found,\r\nwhereas only twenty-six were met with in the reindeer gallery.\r\n\r\n“Finally, as the cave became out of the reach of the flood waters, the\r\ndrippings from the roof, which up to this period had, with the single\r\nexception before mentioned, been lost in the accumulating cave-earth,\r\nor deposited in thin calcareous incrustations on the exposed bones,\r\nnow commenced that deposit of stalagmite which sealed up and preserved\r\nundisturbed the shingle and cave-earth deposited under former and\r\ndifferent conditions. The cave, however, still continued to be\r\nthe occasional resort of beasts of prey; for sparse remains of the\r\nreindeer, together with those of the bear and rhinoceros, were found in\r\nthe stalagmite floor. After a time the falling in of the roof at places\r\n(and any earthquake movement may have detached blocks from it), and the\r\nexternal surface weathering, stopped up some parts of the cave, and\r\nclosed its entrances with an accumulation of débris. From that time it\r\nceased to be accessible, except to the smaller rodents and burrowing\r\nanimals, and so remained unused and untrodden until its recent\r\ndiscovery and exploration.”[206]\r\n\r\nMr. Pengelly points out[207] an episode in the history of the cave,\r\nbetween the formation and the filling up with its present contents,\r\nwhich is of considerable importance, viewed in relation to the deposits\r\nin Kent’s Hole. Over the empty space in D, of Fig. 95, is an ancient\r\nstalagmite floor, E, constituting the present ceiling, and shutting off\r\nD from the true roof above, E. At the time this was formed, the cave\r\nmust have been filled up to that level with débris, fragments of which\r\nare set in the inferior portion of the calcareous sheet. Subsequently,\r\nand before the present contents, A and B, were introduced, the whole\r\nof this material has been swept away, probably by an unusual flood\r\nsimilar to that alluded to in the second chapter in the Clapham cave.\r\nThe pieces of stalagmite in the cave-earth are, probably, some of\r\nthe relics of the older floor. This filling up, re-excavating, and\r\nre-filling with its present contents, are phenomena which considerably\r\ncomplicate the problems offered not merely by Brixham cave, but also\r\nby those of Kent’s Hole.\r\n\r\nTwo other caverns in the neighbourhood of Brixham, the “Ash Hole” and\r\n“Bench,” have also yielded the remains of the reindeer, hyæna, and\r\nseveral other pleistocene species, and are fully described by Mr.\r\nPengelly, in his essays contributed to the Devonshire Association.[208]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kent’s Hole._\r\n\r\nThe celebrated cave of Kent’s Hole,[209] known from time immemorial,\r\nwas first found to contain fossil bones by Mr. Northmore, and Sir\r\nW. C. Trevelyan in 1824, and was subsequently explored by the Rev. J.\r\nMacEnery in the five following years, during which he met with flint\r\nimplements in association with the extinct animals in the undisturbed\r\nstrata, and obtained the teeth of the sabre-toothed feline, named by\r\nProf. Owen _Machairodus latidens_, which has never before or since\r\nbeen discovered in any other cavern in Britain. His manuscripts\r\nunfortunately were not used until they passed into the hands of Mr.\r\nVivian, of Torquay, who published an abstract in 1859. Subsequently\r\nthey were published in full by Mr. Pengelly, in 1869. The discovery of\r\nthe flint implements, verified by Mr. Godwin Austen in 1840, and six\r\nyears later also by a committee of the Torquay Natural History Society,\r\nwas received with incredulity by the scientific world, until the result\r\nof the exploration of the Brixham cave had placed the fact of the\r\nco-existence of man with the extinct mammalia beyond all doubt. In\r\n1864 a committee[210] was appointed by the British Association for the\r\ncarrying on the investigation, which from that time to the present has\r\nbeen conducted under the careful supervision of Mr. Pengelly.\r\n\r\nThe cave consists of two parallel series of chambers and galleries,\r\nan eastern and a western, which penetrate the low cliff of Devonian\r\nlimestone in the direction of the joints, with a northern and southern\r\nentrance, very nearly at the same level, “about fifty feet apart, from\r\n180 to 190 feet above the level of mean tide, and about seventy feet\r\nabove the bottom of the valley immediately adjacent.” The largest\r\nchamber of the eastern series is sixty-two feet from east to west, and\r\nfifty-three from north to south. The extent of the cave has not yet\r\nbeen ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe contents, examined with the minutest care (on Mr. Pengelly’s\r\nmethod, see Appendix I.), were found to be arranged in the following\r\norder.\r\n\r\n(A.) The surface was composed of dark earth varying in thickness from\r\na few inches to a foot, on which rested large blocks of limestone,\r\nfallen from the roof. It contained mediæval remains, Roman pottery,\r\nand combs fashioned out of bone, similar to those discovered in the\r\nVictoria and Dowkerbottom caves in Yorkshire, which prove that the cave\r\nwas frequented during the historic period. A barbed iron spear-head,\r\na bronze spear-head, other bronze articles, and polished stone celts,\r\nestablish the fact that it was also used during the iron, bronze,\r\nand neolithic ages. This stratum contained the broken bones of the\r\nshort-horn (_Bos longifrons_), goat, and horse, large quantities of\r\ncharcoal, and was to a great extent a refuse-heap like that in the\r\nVictoria cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Lanceolate Implement from Kent’s Hole (1/1).\r\n(Evans.)[211]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Oval Implement from Kent’s Hole (1/1) (Evans.)]\r\n\r\n(B.) Below this was a stalagmite floor, varying in thickness from one\r\nto three feet, covering\r\n\r\n(C.) The red earth, with stones, bones of the extinct animals, and\r\nflint implements, associated together in the greatest confusion, as\r\nwell as large lumps of stalagmite and of breccia, which had been torn\r\nout of a pre-existent floor. In the “vestibule,” near one of the\r\nentrances, a black layer beneath the stalagmite, composed, to a great\r\nextent, of charcoal, indicated the position of the fire-places, and\r\ncontained a vast number of rude unpolished palæolithic implements.\r\nThere were also local stalagmitic bands. The flint implements were\r\nmet with at various depths, and consist of three distinct types: the\r\nlanceolate, Fig. 96, the oval, with edge carefully chipped for cutting,\r\nFig. 97, and the flake (see Fig. 106). Besides these a few implements\r\nhave been discovered of the same shape as those found in the gravel\r\nbeds; in outline and section roughly triangular, and tapering to a\r\npoint from a blunt base, which was probably intended to be held in the\r\nhand.[212] Several articles of bone and antler were also met with,\r\ncomprising an awl, or piercer, a needle with the eye large enough to\r\nadmit small packthread, and three harpoon-heads, one of which is barbed\r\non both sides (Fig. 98), the others being merely barbed on one side\r\n(Fig. 99). A rounded pebble of coarse red sandstone, battered into a\r\ncheese-like form, by being used as a hammer (Fig. 100), was also found.\r\nAll these articles bring the palæolithic inhabitants of Kent’s Hole\r\ninto relation with those of the caves and rock-shelters of the south\r\nof France, to be described in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Harpoon from Kent’s Hole (1/1). (Evans.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Harpoon-head from Kent’s Hole (1/1). (Evans.)]\r\n\r\n(D.) The cave-earth rested on a compact, dark red breccia composed of\r\nangular fragments of limestone and pebbles of sandstone embedded in a\r\nsandy calcareous paste, identical in constitution with the fragments\r\nof the older breccia discovered in the cave-earth. It has furnished\r\nbones of bears, and four flint implements. The cave-earth, C, and the\r\nbreccia, E, seem to stand to one another in an inverse ratio as regards\r\nthickness: where the former was thin, the latter was sometimes as much\r\nas twelve feet thick. From this relation, as well as from the imbedded\r\nfragments of the latter, it may be concluded that the former is the\r\nmore modern, and that in the interval between their accumulation the\r\nlatter had been, to a considerable extent, broken up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Hammer-stone (1/2). (Evans.)]\r\n\r\nThere is very good reason for the belief, that before any of the\r\npresent cave-earth was introduced, Kent’s Hole had been filled nearly\r\nto the roof by an older cave accumulation, now represented by the\r\nundisturbed breccia and the included fragments. In a portion of the\r\ncave termed the “gallery,” there is a sheet of stalagmite, extending\r\noverhead from wall to wall, and constituting a ceiling that reaches\r\nfrom wall to wall, without further support than that offered by its\r\nown cohesion. Above it, in the limestone rock, there is a considerable\r\nalcove. This branch of the cavern, therefore, is divided into three\r\nstories or flats, that below the floor occupied with cave-earth, that\r\nbetween the floor and the ceiling entirely unoccupied, and that above\r\nthe ceiling also without a deposit of any kind. For such a sheet of\r\nstalagmite to have been formed it is absolutely necessary for the cave\r\nto have been filled up to its level with materials of some kind, just\r\nas it is necessary for the formation of a film of ice that it should be\r\ncrystallized from the surface of water. We may, therefore, infer that\r\nKent’s Hole, like Brixham, was originally filled up to the level of the\r\nceiling (see Fig. 95, E), then that the contents were swept out, with\r\nthe exception of the breccia, and lastly, that the present cave-earth\r\nwas introduced. The occurrence of the remains of bear, and of flint\r\nimplements, in this breccia also proves that man and bears were living\r\nin the district, while it was being accumulated, probably by the action\r\nof the floods to which, from time to time, the cave was subjected. All\r\nthe flint implements in the breccia are of the ruder and larger form\r\nwhich is presented by those from the pleistocene deposits of the Somme,\r\nSeine, and the rivers of the south and east of England.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in the identification of the mammals in 1869, with\r\nMr. W. A. Sanford, I detected splinters of bears’ canines, from the\r\ncave-earth, remarkable for their density, crystalline structure, and\r\nsemi-conchoidal fracture, which were in the same mineral state as those\r\nfrom the older breccia. One of these had been fashioned into a flake\r\nafter its mineralization, and presented an edge chipped by use. The\r\ntooth from which it was struck was, probably, imbedded and mineralized\r\nin the older breccia, then washed out of it, and afterwards chosen for\r\nthe manufacture of an implement. It was already fossil and altered in\r\nstructure in the palæolithic age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The probable Age of the Machairodus of Kent’s Hole._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable animal discovered in the cave, by the Rev. J.\r\nMacEnery, is the _Machairodus latidens_,[213] or large lion-like\r\nanimal, armed with double-edged canines, in shape like the blade of a\r\nsabre, and with two serrated edges. Five canines and two incisors were\r\ndug out of the cave-earth, C, in the Wolf’s Passage, along with vast\r\nquantities of bones and teeth of the mammoth, rhinoceros, Irish elk,\r\nhorse, and hyæna. One of the canines is represented in Figs. 101, 102,\r\nwhich are taken from one of the original plates drawn for Dr. Buckland,\r\nand now in the Museum of the Torquay Natural History Society. The two\r\nincisors, Figs. 103, 104, 105, are also characterised by their serrated\r\nedges. A third was discovered by the exploration committee in the same\r\nspot, in 1872, scarcely to be distinguished from that in Figs. 103,\r\n104, which finally dispelled the scepticism of some eminent naturalists\r\nas to whether any of these teeth had been obtained in the cave by the\r\nRev. J. MacEnery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 101, 102.--Upper Canine of Machairodus, Kent’s\r\nHole (1/1). (MacEnery.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Machairodus latidens_ has been found in pleistocene strata in two\r\nlocalities in France: in a deposit of diluvium, near Puy, by M. Aymard,\r\nand in the cavern of Baume in the Jura, considered by M. Lartet to\r\nbe of preglacial age.[214] In the latter it was associated with the\r\nhorse, ox, wild-boar, elephant, a non-tichorine species of rhinoceros,\r\nthe cave-bear, and the spotted hyæna. In the autumn of 1873, I met\r\nwith proof that the animal also lived in France in the pleiocene\r\nperiod. M. Lortet, the Director of the Museum of Natural History, at\r\nLyons, called my attention to a canine, in the Palais des Beaux Arts,\r\nwhich coincides exactly in all its dimensions with one of those from\r\nKent’s Hole. It was found at Chagny (Saône et Loire) near Dijon, along\r\nwith _Mastodon arvernensis_, the Etruscan or megarhine species of\r\nrhinoceros, horse, beaver and hyæna, somewhat resembling that from\r\nthe Crag (_Hyæna antiqua_) of Suffolk described by Mr. Lankester. The\r\nspecies, therefore, is pleiocene, and it belongs to a genus which is\r\nwidely distributed in the meiocene strata of Europe and North America,\r\nas well as in the pleiocene of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo what era in the complicated history of Kent’s Hole is this animal\r\nto be assigned? The more ancient, or the more modern? The evidence on\r\nthis point is, to a certain extent, contradictory. On the one hand it\r\nis a pleiocene species, belonging to a group of animals that inhabited\r\nEurope before the lowering of the temperature caused the invasion\r\nof the arctic mammalia from the north and the east: it is moreover\r\nof a distinctly southern type. In the teeth marks on the incisors,\r\nFigs. 103, 104, 105, as well as on the canines, we have unmistakeable\r\ntraces of the presence of the hyæna; and since the spotted hyæna\r\nabounds in the cave, to its teeth the marks in question may probably\r\nbe referred. It seems, therefore, probable that the animal inhabited\r\nDevonshire during an early stage of the pleistocene period, before\r\nthe arctic invaders had taken full possession of the valley of the\r\nEnglish Channel, and of the low grounds which now lie within the\r\n100-fathom line off the Atlantic shore of Western France. There must\r\nnecessarily have been a swinging to and fro of animal life over the\r\ngreat, fertile low-lying region, which is now submerged (see Map,\r\nFig. 126); and before the temperature of France had been sufficiently\r\nlowered to exterminate or drive out the southern forms, it is most\r\nnatural to suppose that in warm seasons some of the southern mammalia\r\nwould find their way northwards, and especially a formidable carnivore\r\nsuch as the machairodus. The extreme rarity of its remains forbids\r\nthe hypothesis that it was a regular inhabitant of Britain during the\r\npleistocene age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 103, 104, 105.--Incisors of Machairodus, Kent’s\r\nHole (1/1). (MacEnery.)[215]]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the recent discovery of a second incisor in the\r\nuppermost portion of the cave-earth, in July 1872, in the same\r\ncondition as the remains usually found, and associated with the bones\r\nand teeth of hyæna, horse, and bear, is considered by Sir Charles Lyell\r\nand Mr. Pengelly proof of the animal having lived during the deposition\r\nof the later cave-earth, or in the later stage of the pleistocene.\r\nThe condition of a bone, however, is a very fallacious guide to its\r\nantiquity, and although the fragments of the older contents of the cave\r\nare in a different mineral state, it is improbable that the ossiferous\r\ncontents of so large a cave should have been mineralized exactly in\r\nthe same way. Nor is an appeal to its perfect state conclusive, since\r\nseveral teeth of bear, which I have examined from the breccia, are\r\nequally perfect.\r\n\r\nThe view of the high antiquity of machairodus in Kent’s Hole derives\r\nsupport from the discovery of _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ at Oreston, a\r\nspecies which is very abundant in the Italian pleiocene strata, and\r\nnot uncommon in those of France,--a species with its headquarters in\r\nthe south, but ranging as far north as Norfolk in the early stage of\r\nthe pleistocene age, represented by the forest bed of Cromer, and that\r\nlived in the valley of the Thames, while the gravel-beds of Crayford\r\nand Grays Thurrock were being deposited by the ancient river. The\r\noccurrence of either of these animals in a cave is exceptional, and\r\nthe presence of both in caves on the edge of the great plain extending\r\nsouthwards from the present coastline of Devon, seems to me to imply\r\nthat both were open during the early stage of the pleistocene, while\r\nthe pleiocene mammalia were retreating before the southward advance\r\nof the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, spotted hyæna, reindeer, and their\r\ncongeners, at a time anterior to the lowering of the temperature that\r\nculminated in the glacial period. For these reasons it seems to me\r\nprobable that the machairodus belongs to an early rather than a late\r\nstage in the history of Kent’s Hole.\r\n\r\nThere is an important point of resemblance between the mode of the\r\noccurrence of the machairodus in Kent’s Hole, and of the megarhine\r\nrhinoceros at Oreston. The remains of both were met with only _in\r\none spot_, and were not scattered through the chambers and passages.\r\nIt may have happened that in the physical changes which those caves\r\nhave undergone, both were preserved in a fissure like that described\r\nin the Uphill cave (p. 294), and that subsequently they dropped\r\ndown and became imbedded in a newer deposit. In fixing the age of\r\nstrata in caves it seems to me that the zoological evidence is of far\r\ngreater weight than that of mere position, which may be the result of\r\naccidental circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Ireland._\r\n\r\nThe caves of Ireland would probably afford as rich a fauna as those\r\nof Britain, had they been explored with equal care. In one at\r\nShandon, near Dungarvan, Waterford, remains of the brown bear (_U.\r\narctos_) reindeer, horse, and mammoth were discovered in 1859, by Mr.\r\nBrenan.[216] The first of these animals became extinct in Ireland\r\nbefore the historic period, while it survived in Britain at least as\r\nlate as the Roman occupation.\r\n\r\nThe cave-bear is also recorded by Dr. Carte,[217] from the same place,\r\nbut the thigh bone assigned to it seems to me to belong to the brown,\r\nor common species. The mammoth, so abundant in Britain, has only been\r\ndiscovered in two other localities in Ireland, at Whitechurch near\r\nDungarvan, and at Magherry near Belturbet.[218]\r\n\r\nThe range of these animals over Great Britain and Ireland in the\r\npleistocene age enables us to realize the ancient physical geography,\r\nwhich will be treated in the next and following chapters as part of the\r\ngeneral question of the physical condition of north-western Europe at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  THE INHABITANTS OF THE CAVES OF NORTH-WESTERN EUROPE, AND THE\r\n    EVIDENCE OF THE FAUNA AS TO THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE.\r\n\r\n  The Caves of France, Baume, of Périgord.--Caves and Rock-shelters\r\n    of Belgium, Trou de Naulette.--Caves of Switzerland.--\r\n    Cave-dwellers and Palæolithic Men of River-deposits.--\r\n    Classification of Palæolithic Caves.--Relation of Cave-dwellers\r\n    to Eskimos.--Pleistocene animals living north of Alps and\r\n    Pyrenees.--Relation of Cave to River-bed Fauna.--The Atlantic\r\n    Coastline.--Distribution of Palæolithic Implements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of France._\r\n\r\nThe caves of France have been proved, by the explorations carried on\r\nduring the course of the present century, to contain the same animals,\r\nintroduced under the same conditions as those which we have already\r\ndescribed. Some species, however, have been met with which have not\r\nbeen discovered in this country. In the cave of Lunel-viel, for\r\nexample, the common striped hyæna of Africa (_Hyæna striata_) has been\r\nfound by Marcel de Serres, to whom belongs the credit of being the\r\nfirst systematic explorer of caverns in France. In that of Bruniquel,\r\nthe ibex, now found only in the higher mountains in Europe, the chamois\r\nand the _Antelope saiga_, an animal inhabiting the plains of the\r\nregion of the Volga and of southern Siberia, have been identified by\r\nProf. Owen; while in the collection obtained by Mr. Moggridge from the\r\ncaves of Mentone, Prof. Busk has recognized the marmot. With these\r\nexceptions there is no distinction between the faunas of the bone-caves\r\nof this country and of France.[219]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Baume._\r\n\r\nThe _Machairodus latidens_,[220] or great sabre-toothed feline of\r\nKent’s Hole, has been discovered in the cave of Baume in the Jura,\r\naccording to M. Gervais,[221] along with the horse, ox, wild-boar,\r\nelephant, a non-tichorhine species of rhinoceros, the spotted hyæna,\r\nand the cave-bear, or the same group of animals as that with which it\r\nis found in Kent’s Hole. The cave is considered by M. Lartet[222] to be\r\nof preglacial age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Périgord._\r\n\r\nThe caves and rock-shelters of Périgord, explored by the late M.\r\nLartet and our countryman, Mr. Christy,[223] 1863-4, have not only\r\nafforded cumulative proof of the co-existence of man with the extinct\r\nmammalia, but have given us a clue as to the race to which he belonged.\r\nThey penetrate the sides of the valleys of the Dordogne and Vezère at\r\nvarious levels, as may be seen in Fig. 71, and are full of the remains\r\nleft behind by their ancient inhabitants, which give as vivid a picture\r\nof the human life of the period, as that revealed of Italian manners\r\nin the first century by the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\nThe old floors of human occupation consist of broken bones of animals\r\nkilled in the chase, mingled with rude implements, weapons of bone, and\r\nunpolished stone, and charcoal and burnt stones which point out the\r\nposition of the hearths.\r\n\r\nFlakes (Fig. 106) without number, rude stone-cutters, awls,\r\nlance-heads, hammers, saws made of flint or of chert, rest pêle-mêle\r\nwith bone needles, sculptured reindeer antlers, engraved stones,\r\narrow-heads, harpoons, and pointed bones, and with the broken remains\r\nof the animals which had been used as food, the reindeer, bison, horse,\r\nthe ibex, the saiga antelope, and the musk sheep. In some cases the\r\nwhole is compacted by a calcareous cement into a hard mass, fragments\r\nof which are to be seen in the principal museums of Europe. This\r\nstrange accumulation of débris marks, beyond all doubt, the place where\r\nancient hunters had feasted, and the broken bones and implements are\r\nmerely the refuse cast aside. The reindeer formed by far the larger\r\nportion of the food, and must have lived in enormous herds at that time\r\nin the centre of France. The severity of the climate at the time may be\r\ninferred by the presence of this animal, as well as by the accumulation\r\nof bones on the spots on which man had fixed his habitation. Indeed,\r\nhad not this been the case, the decomposition of so much animal matter\r\nwould have rendered the place uninhabitable even by the lowest savage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Flint-flake, Les Eyzies (1/1). (Lartet and\r\nChristy.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 107.--Flint Scraper, Les Eyzies (1/1). (Lartet and Christy.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 108.--Flint Javelin-head, Laugerie Haute (1/1). (Lartet and\r\nChristy.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the animals mentioned above, the cave-bear and lion have been\r\nmet with in one, and the mammoth in five localities, and their remains\r\nbear marks of cutting or scraping, which show that they fell a prey to\r\nhunters. The Irish elk, also, and the hyæna occur respectively in the\r\ncave of Laugerie Basse, and of Moustier, but the latter certainly did\r\nnot gain access to the refuse-heaps, because the vertebræ are intact\r\nwhich it is in the habit of eating. For the same reason also, M.\r\nLartet infers that the hunters were not aided in the chase by the dog.\r\nThere is no evidence that they were possessed of any domestic animal.\r\nThere were no spindle wheels to indicate a knowledge of spinning, nor\r\npotsherds to show an acquaintance with the potter’s art. In both these\r\nrespects they resemble the Fuegians, Eskimos, and Australians, and\r\ncontrast strongly with the neolithic races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Flint Arrow-head, Laugerie Haute (1/1).\r\n(Lartet and Christy.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--Bone needle, La Madelaine (1/1). (Lartet and\r\nChristy.)]\r\n\r\nThe broken bones show that the reindeer furnished the more usual food,\r\nand next to that the horse, and then the bison. And from the absence\r\nof the vertebræ and pelvic bones of the two latter animals, M. Lartet\r\nconcludes that they were cut up where they were killed, and the meat\r\nstripped from the backbone and the pelvis. Their food was probably\r\ncooked by boiling, the number of round stones used for heating water\r\nand bearing marks of fire, like the “pot boilers” of some of the\r\nAmerican Indians, being very considerable.\r\n\r\nAmong the stone implements flint flakes were incredibly numerous, and\r\nthe number of chips scattered about as well as the blocks of flint\r\nfrom which they had been struck, proved that they had been made on the\r\nspot; most of these flakes were notched by use (Fig. 106). Instruments\r\nwith the ends carefully rounded off (Fig. 107) were also abundant, and\r\nfrom their analogy with similar instruments used by the Eskimos, there\r\ncan be but little doubt that they were intended for the preparation\r\nof skins (compare Fig. 107 with Fig. 124). The ends of some were\r\nchipped to a point for insertion into a handle, while others rounded\r\nat both ends were probably used freely in the hand. In the cave of\r\nMoustier oval implements were met with, resembling those figured from\r\nthe caverns of Kent’s Hole and Wookey (Figs. 84 and 97). The spear,\r\njavelin, and arrow-heads of flint presented two modes of attachment to\r\nthe shaft, the base of some being squared off with a notch above for\r\nthe ligature (as in Fig. 108), while in others (Fig. 109) it tapered\r\noff into a point intended for insertion. This latter form has been\r\nobtained also in Kent’s Hole.\r\n\r\nThe bone needles are carefully smoothed, and were pierced with a\r\nneatly-made eye (Fig. 110) by means of pointed flakes which were\r\nfound along with them, and the use of which M. Lartet demonstrated\r\nby experiment. They had been sawn out of the compact metacarpals and\r\ntarsals of the reindeer[224] and the horse, and subsequently rounded\r\non fragments of sandstone, the grooves of which fitted them. In this,\r\ntherefore, we have not merely the evidence that the hunters were\r\nin the habit of sewing, but also we have vividly brought before us\r\nthe very method by which their needles were manufactured. They were\r\nprobably used for sewing skins together, the tendon of a reindeer\r\nforming the thread, as among the modern Eskimos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 111, 112.--Harpoons of Antler, La Madelaine.\r\n(Lartet and Christy.)\r\n\r\nFIGS. 113, 114.--Arrow-heads, Gorge d’Enfer. (Broca.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 115.--Bone Awl, Gorge d’Enfer (1/1). (Broca.)]\r\n\r\nThe heads of arrows and lances are made principally out of reindeer\r\nantler, and are barbed, the barbs generally being grooved, and carved\r\non both sides of the axis (Figs. 111, 112, 113); but in some cases,\r\nas in Fig. 114, the barbs are only on one side. Many bones and antlers\r\nare variously carved into shapes for which it is impossible to assign a\r\ndefinite use. Fig. 115 is a bone awl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--Carved Handle of Reindeer Antler (1/2).\r\n(Lartet and Christy.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Two sides of Reindeer Antler, La Madelaine\r\n(1/1). (Lartet and Christy.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Horses engraved on Antler, La Madelaine\r\n(1/1). (Lartet and Christy.)]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable remains left behind by man in these refuse-heaps\r\nare the sculptured reindeer antlers, and the figures engraved on\r\nfragments of schist and on ivory. A well-defined outline of an ox\r\nstands out boldly from one piece of antler. A second presents us with\r\na most elegant design: a reindeer is kneeling down in an easy attitude\r\nwith its head thrown up in the air, so that the antlers rest on the\r\nshoulders, and the back of the animal forms an even surface for a\r\nhandle, which is too small to be grasped in an ordinary European hand\r\n(Fig. 116). In a third a man stands close to a horse’s head, and hard\r\nby is a fish like an eel; and on the other side of the same cylinder\r\nare two heads of bison, drawn with sufficient clearness to ensure\r\nrecognition by anyone who had ever seen that animal (Fig. 117). On\r\na fourth the natural curvature of one of the tines has been taken\r\nadvantage of by the artist to engrave the head, and the characteristic\r\nrecurved horns of the ibex; and on a fifth are figures of horses (Fig.\r\n118), in which the upright disheveled mane and shaggy ungroomed tail\r\nare represented with admirable spirit. At first sight it would appear\r\nthat the artist had drawn the heads out of all proportion to the\r\nbodies. A horse’s skeleton, however, from the palæolithic “station”\r\nat Solutré, lately set up in the Museum at Lyons, proves that this is\r\nnot the case, since, as M. Lortet pointed out to me, it is remarkable\r\nfor its massive head, and small body. In Fig. 119 a group of reindeer\r\nare seen, two on their backs, and two in the act of walking. The\r\nIrish elk, red-deer, and probably rhinoceros, are also depicted, the\r\nfigures upon the hard schist being feebly and uncertainly drawn, as\r\nmight be expected from the character of the tools. The most clever\r\nsculptor of modern times would, probably, not succeed very much better\r\nif his graver was a splinter of flint, and stone and bone were the\r\nmaterials to be engraved. One peculiarity runs through the figures of\r\nanimals. With but two exceptions none of the feet are represented, a\r\ncircumstance which is probably due, as Mr. Franks has suggested to me,\r\nto the fact that the hunters merely represented what they saw of the\r\nanimal, of which the feet would be concealed by the herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Group of Reindeer, Dordogne. (Broca.)]\r\n\r\nThe most striking figure that has been discovered is that of the\r\nmammoth,[225] Fig. 120, engraved on a fragment of its own tusk, the\r\npeculiar spiral curvature of the tusk and the long mane, which are not\r\nnow to be found in any living elephant, proving that the original was\r\nfamiliar to the eye of the artist. The discovery of whole carcases of\r\nthe animal in northern Siberia, preserved from decay in the frozen\r\ncliffs and morasses, has made us acquainted with the existence of\r\nthe long hairy mane. Had not it thus been handed down to our eyes,\r\nwe should probably have treated this most accurate drawing as a mere\r\nartist’s freak. Its peculiarities are so faithfully depicted that it is\r\nquite impossible for the animal to be confounded with either of the\r\ntwo living species. These drawings probably employed the idle hours of\r\nthe hunter, and perpetuate the scenes which he witnessed in the chase.\r\nThey are full of artistic feeling, and are evidently drawn from life.\r\nThe mammoth is engraved on its own ivory, the reindeer generally on\r\nreindeer antler, and the stag on stag antler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Mammoth engraved on Ivory, La Madelaine\r\n(1/2). (Lartet and Christy.)]\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts we must picture to our minds, that these ancient\r\ndwellers in the caves of Aquitaine lived by hunting and fishing, that\r\nthey were acquainted with fire, and that they were clad with skins\r\nsewn together with sinews or strips of intestines. That they did not\r\npossess the dog is shown, not merely by the negative evidence of its\r\nnot having been discovered, but also by the fact that the bones which\r\nit invariably eats, such as the vertebræ, are preserved. They did not\r\npossess any domestic animals, and there is no evidence that they were\r\nacquainted with the potter’s art. M. de Mortillet’s view, that the\r\nart of making pottery was unknown in the palæolithic age, seems to me\r\nto be probably true, the reputed cases of the discovery of potsherds\r\nbeing always connected with suspicious circumstances, which render it\r\nprobable that they were subsequently introduced.\r\n\r\nBesides the remains of the animals in the refuse-heaps were fragmentary\r\nportions of human skeletons, which, however, were not scraped or broken\r\nso as to imply the practice of cannibalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of Belgium._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Carved Implement of Reindeer Antler, Goyet\r\n(1/2). (Dupont.)]\r\n\r\nThe researches of Dr. Schmerling[226] into the caves of Belgium, in\r\n1829-30, revealed the fact that the animals so abundant in the caves\r\nof Germany, were equally numerous in those in the neighbourhood of\r\nLiége, and the flint flakes, and the fragments of human bones, which\r\nhe found may possibly be of palæolithic age. He also discovered\r\nthe remains of the porcupine, a species no longer living north of\r\nthe Alps and Pyrenees. The systematic exploration, however, of the\r\npalæolithic caves in that district was not carried out until, in the\r\nyear 1864, M. Dupont[227] began the investigation of those in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dinant-sur-Meuse, on behalf of the Belgian Government.\r\nHis results, based upon the examination of upwards of twenty caves\r\nand rock-shelters, are published in a series of papers read before\r\nthe Royal Academy of Belgium and subsequently in a separate work.\r\nBesides the remains of the animals living in Belgium within the\r\nhistoric period, he met with the ibex, chamois, and marmot, which\r\nare now to be found only in the mountainous districts of Europe, the\r\ntailless hare, lemming, and arctic fox, of the northern regions, the\r\n_Antelope saiga_, grizzly bear, lion, hyæna, and others. Most of these\r\nspecies occurred in refuse accumulations, their remains being in the\r\nfragmentary condition of those of the French caves. The associated\r\nimplements are of the same type as those of Périgord, and some of\r\nthem are ornamented in the same manner as, for example, that from\r\nthe cavern of Goyet, Fig. 121, termed a “bâton de commandement,” but\r\nwhich, from its analogy with similar articles in the British Museum,\r\nis most probably an arrow-straightener. Those of flint are also of the\r\nsame kind, and in several of the caves there was the same association\r\nof fragmentary human remains with the relics of the feasts as in the\r\nFrench refuse-heaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trou de Naulette._\r\n\r\nThe human remains consisting of a lower jaw, ulna and metatarsal,\r\ndiscovered in the large cavern of Naulette,[228] on the left bank of\r\nthe Lesse, in association with the broken remains of the rhinoceros,\r\nmammoth, reindeer, chamois, and marmot, are undoubtedly of palæolithic\r\nage, since they rested in an undisturbed stratum. M. Dupont gives the\r\nfollowing section in descending order.\r\n\r\n                                                             METRES.\r\n  1. Sandy grey and yellow clay                               2·90\r\n  2. Yellow grey clay with stones and bones of ruminants      0·45\r\n  3. Stalagmite.\r\n  4. Tufa.\r\n  5. Three bands of clay alternating with stalagmite.\r\n  6. Sandy clay with human bones at the depth of four metres.\r\n  7. Stalagmite.\r\n  8. Cave-earth with bones gnawed by hyænas.\r\n\r\nThe human jaw is remarkable for its prognathism, which, according to\r\nDr. Hamy, is greater than that which has been observed in any living\r\nraces. The cave had afforded shelter to the hyænas before it had been\r\nused by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Caves of Switzerland._\r\n\r\nThe caves of Switzerland also contain the same class of rude\r\nimplements and carvings. Prof. Rupert Jones has called my attention\r\nto a recent discovery of carved reindeer antlers, and harpoon-heads,\r\nsimilar to those figured from the Dordogne, in a cave in the Canton\r\nof Schaaffhausen,[229] along with the bones of hyæna, reindeer, and\r\nmammoth. In that of Veyrier,[230] carved implements were found along\r\nwith the remains of the ox, horse, chamois, and ibex, some of which,\r\nshown to me by Dr. Gosse, at the meeting of the French Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science, at Lyons in 1873, are of the same form and\r\nsize as the arrow-straightener from the cave of Goyet (Fig. 121).\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, infer that the same palæolithic race of men once\r\nranged over the whole region from the Pyrenees and Switzerland, as far\r\nto the north as Belgium. And since Prof. Fraas has obtained similar\r\nimplements from a refuse-heap at Schussenreid in Würtemberg, they\r\nwandered as far to the east as that district, while the discoveries in\r\nKent’s Hole and Wookey Hole prove that they extended as far to the west\r\nas Somersetshire and Devonshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cave-dwellers and Palæolithic Men of the River-gravels._\r\n\r\nThese palæolithic cave-dwellers are considered by Mr. Evans[231]\r\nto belong to the same race as those who have left their rude flint\r\nimplements in the river-gravels in the valleys of the Thames, the\r\nSomme, the Seine, and in the eastern counties, as far to the north as\r\nPeterborough. We must, however, allow that a marked difference is to be\r\nobserved between a series of flint implements found in the caves, as\r\ncompared with a series found in the river-strata, although some forms\r\nare common to the two; as for instance some of those found in Brixham\r\nand Kent’s Hole. This difference can scarcely be explained on the\r\nsupposition that the small things would be less likely to be preserved\r\nin the fluviatile deposits, because it leaves the rarity in the caves\r\nof the larger fluviatile forms unaccounted for. It is perhaps safer,\r\nin the present state of our knowledge, to consider the two sets to be\r\ndistinct from each other. The direct superposition in Kent’s Hole of\r\nthe stratum with the ordinary cave-type of implement, over that with\r\nthe ordinary fluviatile type, may perhaps prove that the latter is the\r\nolder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of Palæolithic Caves._\r\n\r\nThe palæolithic caves are divided by M. Lartet[232] into four groups,\r\naccording to the species of animals which they contain; into those\r\nof the age of the cave-bear, of the age of the mammoth and woolly\r\nrhinoceros, of the age of the reindeer, and of the age of bison. Dr.\r\nHamy follows Sir John Lubbock,[233] in considering the age of the\r\ncave-bear to be co-extensive with that of the mammoth, and in the\r\nclassification of caves he adopts a series of transitions. M. Dupont\r\ndivides the caves of Belgium into those belonging to the age of the\r\nmammoth, and to that of the reindeer.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to refer a given cave to the age of the reindeer or of the\r\nmammoth because it contains the remains of those animals, but the\r\ndivision has been rendered worthless for chronological purposes, by the\r\nfact that both these animals inhabited the region north of the Alps\r\nand Pyrenees at the same time, and are to be found together in nearly\r\nevery bone-cave explored in that area. The difference between the\r\ncontents of one palæolithic cave and another, is probably largely due\r\nto the fact that man could more easily catch some animals than others,\r\nas well as to the preference for one kind of food before another. And\r\nthe abundance of the reindeer, which is supposed to characterise the\r\nreindeer period, may reasonably be accounted for by the fact, that it\r\nwould be more easily captured by a savage hunter, than the mammoth,\r\nwoolly rhinoceros, cave-bear, lion, or hyæna. The classification will\r\napply, as I have shown in my essay on the pleistocene mammalia,[234]\r\nneither to the caves of this country, of Belgium, nor of France, and\r\nmy views are shared by M. de Mortillet,[235] after a careful and\r\nindependent examination of the whole evidence.\r\n\r\nThe division of the caves also into ages, according to the various\r\ntypes of implements found in them, proposed by M. de Mortillet, seems\r\nto be equally unsatisfactory; for there is no greater difference in the\r\nimplements of any two of the palæolithic caves, than is to be observed\r\nbetween those of two different tribes of Eskimos, while the general\r\nresemblance is most striking. The principle of classification by the\r\nrelative rudeness, assumes that the progress of man has been gradual,\r\nand that the ruder implements are therefore the older. The difference,\r\nhowever, may have been due to different tribes, or families, having\r\nco-existed without intercourse with each other, as is now generally the\r\ncase with savage communities; or to the supply of flint, chert, and\r\nother materials for cutting instruments, being greater in one region\r\nthan in another.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Cave-dwellers to Eskimos._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Eskimos Spear-head, bone (1/2).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Eskimos Arrow-straightener of Walrus Tooth\r\n(1/1). (Brit. Mus.)]\r\n\r\nCan these cave-dwellers be identified with any people now living on the\r\nface of the earth? or are they as completely without representatives as\r\ntheir extinct contemporaries, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros?\r\nAbsolute certainty we cannot hope to obtain on the point, but the\r\ncumulative evidence enables an answer to be given which is probably\r\ntrue. Along the American shore of the great Arctic Ocean, in the\r\nregion of everlasting snow, dwell the Eskimos, living by hunting and\r\nfishing, speaking the same language, and using the same implements from\r\nthe Straits of Behring on the west, to Greenland on the east. Their\r\nimplements and weapons, brought home by the arctic explorers, enable us\r\nto institute a comparison with those found in the palæolithic caves.\r\nThe harpoons in the Ashmolean collection at Oxford, brought over by\r\nCaptain Beechey and Lieut. Harding from West Georgia, as well as those\r\nin the British Museum, are almost identical in shape and design with\r\nthose from the caves of Aquitaine and Kent’s Hole; the only difference\r\nbeing that some of the latter have grooved barbs. The heads of the\r\nfowling and fishing spears, darts, and arrows, as well as the form of\r\ntheir bases for insertion into the shafts, are also identical (Fig.\r\n122), as may be seen from a comparison of Fig. 122 with Figs. 99 and\r\n114. The curiously carved instrument, Fig. 123, which the Eskimos use\r\nfor straightening their arrows is variously ornamented with designs of\r\nanimals, analogous to those cut on the reindeer antlers in Aquitaine;\r\nand if it be compared with the so-called “bâton de commandement,”\r\nFig. 121, it will be seen, that the latter also was probably intended\r\nfor the same purpose; the difference in the shape of the hole in the\r\ntwo figured specimens being also observable in the series of Eskimos\r\narrow-straighteners in the British Museum, and being largely due to\r\nfriction by use. Many of the implements are the same in form. An\r\nEskimos stone scraper for preparing skins, or plane for smoothing wood,\r\nis represented in Fig. 124, which is inserted in a handle of fossil\r\nmammoth ivory, obtained from the frozen ice-cliffs on the shores of the\r\nArctic sea. If it be compared with Fig. 107 from the caves, it will be\r\nseen to be of the same pattern. It is indeed not a little singular,\r\nthat the handle in which it is imbedded should have been formed out of\r\nthe tusks of the same species of elephant as that which was depicted by\r\nthe palæolithic hunter (see Fig. 120), in the south of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Eskimos Plane or Scraper (1/1). (Lartet and\r\nChristy.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the Eskimos lance-heads of stone in the British Museum are of\r\nthe same type as that figured from the caves of the Dordogne (Fig.\r\n108).\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable objects brought home from the northern regions\r\nare the implements of bone and antler which are ornamented with the\r\nfigures of animals hunted by the Eskimos on sea or land. On the side\r\nof one bow in the Ashmolean Museum, used for drilling holes, you see\r\nthem harpooning the whale from their skin boats, and catching birds.\r\nOn a second they are harpooning walrus and catching seals; on a third\r\nthe seals are being dragged home. The huts in which they live, the\r\ntethered dogs, the boat supported on its platform, and their daily\r\noccupations are faithfully represented. One bow is ornamented with a\r\nlarge number of porpoises, while on another is a reindeer hunt in which\r\nthe animals are being attacked while they are crossing a ford. On a\r\nbone implement in the British Museum from Fort Clarence, the reindeer\r\nare being shot down by archers (Fig. 125). The arrow straightener, Fig.\r\n123, is adorned with a reindeer hunting scene, in which the animals are\r\nseen browsing and unsuspicious of the approach of the hunters, who are\r\nadvancing, clad in reindeer skins and wearing antlers on their heads.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these various designs with those from the caves of\r\nFrance and Belgium shows an identity of plan and workmanship, with this\r\ndifference only, that the hunting scenes familiar to the palæolithic\r\ncave-dweller were not the same as those familiar to the Eskimos on\r\nthe shores of the Arctic Ocean. Each sculptured the animals he knew,\r\nand the whale, walrus, and seal were unknown to the inland dwellers\r\nin Aquitaine, just as the mammoth, bison, and wild horse are unknown\r\nto the Eskimos. The reindeer, which they both knew, is represented in\r\nthe same way by both. The West Georgians made their dirks of walrus\r\ntooth, and ornamented them with carvings of the backbones of fishes;\r\nthe people of Aquitaine used for the same purpose reindeer antlers,\r\nand ornamented them with figures of that animal (see Fig. 116). And it\r\nis worthy of remark that the latter had sufficient artistic feeling to\r\ndepict the mammoth on mammoth ivory, the reindeer generally on reindeer\r\nantler, and the stag on its own antler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Eskimos Hunting-scene (1/1). (Fort Clarence.)]\r\n\r\nAn appeal to the habits of these two peoples, now separated by so\r\nwide an interval of space and time, tends also to show that they\r\nare descended from the same stock. The method of accumulating large\r\nquantities of the bones of animals around their dwelling-places, and\r\nthe habit of splitting the bones for the sake of the marrow, is the\r\nsame in both. Their hides were prepared by the same sort of instruments\r\nand in the same manner, and the needles with which they were sewn\r\ntogether are of the same pattern. The few remains of man among the\r\nrelics of feasts in the caves of Belgium and France, show the same\r\ndisregard of sepulture as that implied by the human skulls lying about\r\nalong with numerous bones of walrus, seal, dog, bear, and fox, in an\r\nEskimos camp in Igloolik, which were carried away by Captain Lyon,\r\nwithout the slightest objection on the part of the relatives of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nAll these facts can hardly be mere coincidences, caused by both peoples\r\nleading a savage life under similar circumstances: they afford reasons\r\nfor the belief that the Eskimos of North America are connected by\r\nblood with the palæolithic cave-dwellers of Europe. To the objection\r\nthat savage tribes living under similar conditions use similar\r\ninstruments, and that, therefore, the correspondence of those of the\r\nEskimos with those of the reindeer folk does not prove that they belong\r\nto the same race, the answer may be made, that there are no two savage\r\ntribes now living which use the same set of implements, without being\r\nconnected by blood. The agreement of one or two of the more common and\r\nruder instruments may be perhaps of no value in classification, but if\r\na whole set agree, fitted for various uses, and some of them rising\r\nabove the most common wants of savage life, we must admit that the\r\nargument as to race is of very great value. The implements found in\r\nBelgium, France, or Britain differ scarcely more from those now used in\r\nWest Georgia, than the latter do from those now in use in Greenland or\r\nMelville Peninsula. The conclusion, therefore, seems inevitable, that\r\nso far as we have any evidence of the race to which the dwellers in\r\nthe Dordogne belong, that evidence points only in the direction of the\r\nEskimos.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is to a great extent confirmed by a consideration of\r\nthe animals found in the caves. The reindeer and the musk sheep afford\r\nfood to the Eskimos now, just as they afforded it to the palæolithic\r\nhunters in Europe. No naturalist would deny that the pleistocene musk\r\nsheep is of the same species as that of North America, and although the\r\nanimal is extinct in Europe and Asia, its remains, scattered through\r\nGermany, Russia in Europe, and Siberia, show that it formerly ranged in\r\nthe whole of that area. The enormous distance, therefore, of southern\r\nFrance from the northern shores of America, cannot be considered as\r\nan obstacle to this view, for, to say the least, palæolithic man would\r\nhave had the same chance of retreating to the north-east as the musk\r\nsheep. The mammoth and bison have also been tracked by their remains in\r\nthe frozen river gravels and morasses through Siberia, as far to the\r\nnorth-east as the American side of the Straits of Behring. Palæolithic\r\nman appeared in Europe with the arctic mammalia, lived in Europe\r\nalong with them, and disappeared with them. And since his implements\r\nare of the same kind as those of the Eskimos, it may reasonably be\r\nconcluded that he is represented at the present time by the Eskimos,\r\nfor it is most improbable that the convergence of the ethnological,\r\nand zoological evidence should be an accident. These views,[236] which\r\nI advanced in 1866, have been to a great extent accepted by Sir John\r\nLubbock in his last edition of Prehistoric Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleistocene Animals living to the North of the Alps and Pyrenees._\r\n\r\nThe principal mammalia inhabiting Britain, France, and Germany during\r\nthe pleistocene age, and contemporary with man in Europe, are given in\r\nthe following table, which shows that the fauna of the region to the\r\nnorth of the Alps and Pyrenees was remarkably uniform. The cave-fauna\r\nof Provence, Italy, and Spain, will be treated of in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |

caves be compared with that of\r\nthe river-deposits of Britain and the continent, it will be seen that\r\nthe same fauna is present in both, and that they are therefore of the\r\nsame geological age.[238] This was the conclusion to which Dr. Falconer\r\nwas led by the examination of the caves of Gower, and it has been\r\nconfirmed by every subsequent discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pleistocene Coast-line of North-Western Europe._\r\n\r\nThe identity of the British pleistocene fauna with that of the\r\ncontinent, leads to the conclusion that in the pleistocene age Britain\r\nwas connected with the adjacent countries by a bridge of land, over\r\nwhich the wild animals had free means of migration. And this might\r\nbe brought about by a comparatively small elevation of the area. The\r\nsoundings show that Britain and Ireland constitute merely the uplands\r\nof a plateau now submerged to the extent of about 100 fathoms, on the\r\nside of the Atlantic. On the east it extends at a depth of from twenty\r\nto fifty fathoms, in the direction of Belgium; and on the south it is\r\nonly sunk from twenty to forty fathoms below the sea-level. Immediately\r\nto the westward of this line the sea deepens so suddenly, that there is\r\nscarcely any difference between the lines of 100 and of 200 fathoms,\r\nand the depth rapidly increases to 2,000. Were this plateau elevated\r\nabove the sea to an extent of 100 fathoms, the tract shaded in the\r\nmap (Fig. 126) would unite the British Isles to the continent, and the\r\nThames and other rivers on the eastern coast would unite with the Elbe\r\nand the Rhine to form a river debouching on the North Sea, somewhat\r\nafter the manner which I have represented by taking the deepest line\r\nof soundings. The Straits of Dover would then be the watershed between\r\nthis valley of the German Ocean, as it may be termed, and that of the\r\nEnglish Channel, in which the Seine and the Somme and other French\r\nrivers joined those of the south coast, and ultimately reached the\r\nAtlantic. Evidence that the latter river flowed in the course assigned\r\nto it in the map is afforded by the discovery of the fresh-water mussel\r\n(_Unio pictorum_), recorded by Mr. Godwin Austen[239] to have been\r\ndredged up by Captain White from a depth of from 50 to 100 fathoms, not\r\nvery far from what I have taken to be its mouth. We are also indebted\r\nto Mr. Godwin Austen for the discovery near this spot of banks of\r\nshingle and littoral shells, which indicate the position of the ancient\r\ncoast-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Physiography of Great Britain in Late\r\nPleistocene Age.\r\n\r\nShaded area = land now submerged; dotted area = region occupied by\r\nanimals; plain area = region occupied by glaciers.]\r\n\r\nThe view that the 100-fathom line marks the limit of the pleistocene\r\nland surface to the west, is held by Sir H. de la Bêche, Mr. Godwin\r\nAusten, Sir Charles Lyell, and other eminent geologists, and it is\r\nsupported by many facts that can be explained in no other manner. To\r\npass over the discovery of a fresh-water shell at the bottom of the\r\nEnglish Channel, quoted above, the distribution of fossil mammalia at\r\nthe bottom of the German Ocean (represented in Fig. 126 by the dotted\r\narea) is analogous to that which we find in the river gravels and\r\nbrick-earths on the land. The quantity of teeth and bones belonging to\r\nthe mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, and spotted hyæna,\r\nand other animals, dredged up by the fishermen in the German Ocean is\r\nalmost incredible. Mr. Owles, of Yarmouth, informed me in 1868 that\r\noff that place there is a bank on which the fishing nets are rarely\r\ncast without bringing up fossil remains. It seems most probable, that\r\nthese accumulations have been formed under subaerial conditions near\r\nthe drinking places, or below the fords, which were used for ages by\r\nthe pleistocene animals. I might quote as an example of a similar\r\ndeposit of fossils on the land, that discovered in 1866 by Captain\r\nLuard, R.E., in digging the foundations of the new cavalry barracks at\r\nWindsor, which consisted mainly of bones and antlers of reindeer, with\r\na few carnivores, such as the brown bear and wolf, that usually follow\r\nreindeer in their migrations in Siberia.[240] Were this submerged it\r\nwould be a case precisely similar to that off Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe ancient forest, exposed at low water under the cliffs on the\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk shores, flourished when the land stood higher than\r\nit does now. Traces of a similar forest, also at, and below, low-water\r\nmark, have been met with on the shore at Selsea, near Chichester, in\r\nSussex; and remains of the mammoth have been dredged up in several\r\nplaces off the coast, as for example in Torbay and in Holyhead harbour,\r\nor found in gravel beds near low-water mark, as in the Isle of Wight,\r\nand on the north coast of Somerset at St. Audries, near Watchet,\r\nwhere a skull with gigantic tusks rested in the gravel. In all these\r\nfacts we have ample proof that Britain stood at a higher level in the\r\npleistocene age than at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe vast abundance also of the mammalia in the caves of South Wales\r\nand Somerset, and their presence in the Island of Caldy, and it may\r\nbe added in Ireland, can only be accounted for by the elevation of\r\nthe present sea-bottom, so as to allow of their migration over plains\r\ncovered with abundant pasture. It seems, therefore, to me that the\r\naccompanying map, Fig. 126, represents with tolerable accuracy the\r\nancient coast-line of Britain, and of the adjacent parts of the\r\ncontinent in the pleistocene age. The fertile valleys of the English\r\nChannel, Bristol Channel, and the German Ocean, would afford sustenance\r\nto a large and varied fauna, and numerous herbivores, such as the\r\nreindeer, bison, and horse, would supply food to the palæolithic\r\nhunters, who followed them in their annual migrations. And it must\r\nbe remarked on this hypothesis, that the valley of the Garonne would\r\noffer a free passage both to the animals and to the hunters of Auvergne\r\ndown to the prairie, extending as far as the 100-fathom line off the\r\nFrench coast, and that the hunting grounds would reach to Devonshire\r\nand Somerset without any barrier except that offered by the rivers. It\r\nis therefore no wonder that the implements in the caves of Kent’s Hole,\r\nWookey Hole, and the South of France, should be of the same type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Palæolithic Implements in this Area._\r\n\r\nThis geographical configuration in pleistocene times may perhaps\r\naccount for the distribution of the palæolithic implements in the\r\nriver gravels. The Seine and the Somme debouch into the same valley\r\nas the rivers of the south of England, and the Straits of Dover mark\r\nthe position of a low watershed leading into the valley of the German\r\nOcean, on the sides of which, in the eastern counties, river-bed\r\nimplements are so numerous. These are of the same type in northern\r\nFrance, Sussex, Hampshire, Kent, and as far north as the Wash; and were\r\ntherefore used by the same race of men. The difference between them and\r\nthose of the cave-dwellers in the south and west, may be due to their\r\npossessors occupying different hunting grounds. Each tribe of American\r\nIndians at the present time has its own territory for hunting, which\r\nis jealously guarded against encroachment, and in which the articles\r\npeculiar to the tribe are being accumulated in the refuse-heaps, while\r\nother sets are being accumulated in other districts. If we suppose\r\nthat the palæolithic savages divided up their hunting grounds in this\r\nmanner, the difference which exists between the implements of the\r\nriver-beds and caves may be readily explained, as well as their being\r\nfound for the most part in different areas.\r\n\r\nThe pleistocene climate in the area north of the Alps and Pyrenees\r\nwill be treated in the eleventh chapter, after the examination of the\r\ncave-fauna of southern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  THE FAUNA OF THE CAVES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE AND THE EVIDENCE AS TO\r\n    THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST-LINE IN THE PLEISTOCENE AGE.\r\n\r\n  Changes of Level in the Mediterranean area in Meiocene and Pleiocene\r\n    Ages.--Bone-caves of Southern Europe.--Of Gibraltar.--Of\r\n    Provence and Mentone.--Of Sicily.--Of Malta.--Range of Pigmy\r\n    Hippopotamus.--Fossil Mammalia in Algeria.--Living Species\r\n    common to Europe and Africa.--Evidence of Soundings.--The\r\n    Glaciers of Lebanon.--Of Anatolia.--Of Atlas.--Glaciers\r\n    probably produced by elevation above the Sea.--Mediterranean\r\n    Coast-line comparatively modern.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen that north-western Europe was\r\nelevated, during the pleistocene age, to an extent of at least 600 feet\r\nabove its present level; so that Ireland was united to Britain, and\r\nBritain was joined to the mainland of Europe, proof of this elevation\r\nbeing dependent upon the soundings on one hand, and the distribution\r\nof the fossil mammalia on the other. Such a change must necessarily\r\nhave affected the whole physical conditions of the area, since the\r\nsubstitution of a mass of land for a stretch of sea, and the higher\r\naltitude of the land, would tend to produce climatal extremes of\r\nconsiderable severity. It is indeed no wonder that during this time\r\nof continental elevation, the hills of Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire,\r\nCumbria, and Scotland should be crowned with glaciers, or that there\r\nshould have been a migration to and fro of animals, comparable to\r\nthat which is now going on in Siberia and the northern portions of\r\nNorth America. The condition of southern Europe at that time has a\r\nmost important bearing on any conclusion which may be drawn as to the\r\npleistocene climate in France, Germany, or Britain. For if it be proved\r\nthat the Mediterranean Sea was then smaller than it is now, the greater\r\nland-surface would increase both the heat of the summer and the cold of\r\nthe winter in central and north-western Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes of Level in Mediterranean area in Meiocene and Pleiocene Ages._\r\n\r\nThe geological evidence that the Mediterranean region has been\r\nsubjected to oscillations of level during the tertiary period, is\r\nclear and decisive. Prof. Gaudry[241] has proved, in his work on\r\nthe fossil remains found at Pikermi, that the plains of Marathon,\r\nnow so restricted, must have extended in the meiocene age far south\r\ninto the Mediterranean, so as to afford pasture to the enormous\r\ntroops of hipparions and herds of antelopes, the mastodons and large\r\nedentata, revealed by his enterprise. The rocky area of Attica, as now\r\nconstituted, could not have supported such a large and varied group\r\nof animals, nor could the broken hills and limestone plateaux have\r\nbeen inhabited by hipparions and antelopes, if their habits at all\r\nresembled those of their descendants living at the present time. It\r\nmay, therefore, reasonably be concluded that Greece, in those times,\r\nwas prolonged southwards, and united to the islands of the Archipelago\r\nby a stretch of land. If Africa were then as now the head-quarters of\r\nthe antelopes, it is very probable that one of the lines by which they\r\npassed over into Europe, and spread over France and Germany, was in\r\nthis direction. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the changes of\r\nlevel, which have taken place since the meiocene age in those regions,\r\nare so complicated as to render it almost impossible to restore the\r\nmeiocene geography.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding, or the pleiocene age, the presence of the African\r\nhippopotamus in Italy, France, and Germany, can only be accounted for\r\nby a more direct connection with the African mainland than is offered\r\nby a route through Asia Minor. It would seem, therefore, that the\r\nMediterranean Sea could not then have formed the same barrier to the\r\nnorthern migration of the animals which it does now. In many regions,\r\nhowever, the present land was then sunk beneath the sea, and marine\r\nstrata, of pleiocene age, were accumulated in the Val d’Arno, Sicily,\r\nand southern France.\r\n\r\nThe physical geography[242] of the Mediterranean in the pleistocene age\r\nmay be ascertained with considerable accuracy by the distribution of\r\nthe animals, coupled with the evidence of the soundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-caves of Southern Europe._\r\n\r\nThe mammalia in the bone-caves of southern Europe differ from those\r\nof the region north of the Alps and Pyrenees in the absence of the\r\narctic species, and the presence of some which are of a more strictly\r\nsouthern type. Nevertheless, the influence of the mountains in lowering\r\nthe temperature in their neighbourhood is to be traced in the presence\r\nof the remains of certain animals. Thus, in the caves of Gibraltar we\r\nfind an ibex, which cannot be distinguished from those of the Spanish\r\nsierras, and in Mentone and Provence, a marmot, specifically identical\r\nwith that of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe bone-caves in the neighbourhood of the Mediterranean afford most\r\nimportant testimony as to the geographical changes which have taken\r\nplace, since the animals found in them lived in that region. We will\r\ntake those of the Iberian peninsula first.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves of Gibraltar._\r\n\r\nOssiferous caverns have long been known to occur in the fortified rock\r\nof Gibraltar,[243] but were not examined scientifically until the\r\nyear 1863, when the researches of Captain Brome, Prof. Busk, and Dr.\r\nFalconer, proved that pleistocene species were buried in considerable\r\nnumbers in its cavities and fissures. Of these the most important is\r\nthe great perpendicular fissure in Windmill Hill, called the Genista\r\ncave, which has been traced down to more than a depth of 200 feet. From\r\nthe upper portion were obtained the polished stone implements, human\r\nskulls, and other neolithic remains described in the sixth chapter, p.\r\n204, which prove that Gibraltar was inhabited by the Basques in the\r\nneolithic age, while the remains from the lower revealed the presence\r\nof a singularly mixed group of animals.\r\n\r\nThe fossil bones have been referred by Prof. Busk and Dr. Falconer to\r\nthe following species:--\r\n\r\n    _Lepus cuniculus_, rabbit.\r\n    _Felis leo_, lion.\r\n    _F. pardus_, panther.\r\n    _F. caffer._\r\n    _F. pardina_, lynx.\r\n    _F. serval_, serval.\r\n    _Ursus ferox_, grizzly bear.\r\n    _Canis lupus_, wolf.\r\n    _Equus caballus_, horse.\r\n    _Rhinoceros hemitœchus._\r\n    _Capra ibex_, ibex.\r\n    _Sus scrofa_, wild-boar.\r\n    _Cervus elaphus_, red deer.\r\n    _C. capreolus_, roe.\r\n    _C. dama_, fallow deer.\r\n\r\nThe spotted hyæna, the serval, and _Felis caffer_, are species now\r\npeculiar to Africa, and it is obvious that they could not have found\r\ntheir way into Gibraltar under the present physical conditions of the\r\nMediterranean. Elephants and rhinoceroses could not have lived on so\r\nbarren and treeless a rock, unless it had overlooked a fertile plain,\r\nnor would the carnivora have chosen it for their dens, had it then been\r\ncut off from the feeding-grounds of the herbivores. Their presence,\r\ntherefore, as Dr. Falconer justly remarks, implies the existence of\r\nland now sunk beneath the waves, but then extending southwards to join\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nTo the African animals, mentioned above as inhabiting the Iberian\r\npeninsula in the pleistocene age, M. Lartet has added the African\r\nelephant (_E. Africanus_) and the striped hyæna (_II. striata_), which\r\nhave been found in a stratum of gravel near Madrid along with flint\r\nimplements.[244] None of the purely arctic mammalia, such as the\r\nreindeer, musk sheep, or woolly rhinoceros, so abundant in France,\r\nGermany, and Britain, have been met with south of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-caves of Provence and Mentone._\r\n\r\nThe arctic animals are also absent from the numerous bone-caves and\r\nbone breccias of Provence and Mentone. The pleistocene fauna of\r\nProvence consists, according to M. Marion,[245] of the spotted hyæna,\r\nand lion, _Elephas antiquus_ or straight-tusked elephant, _Rhinoceros\r\nhemitœchus_, wild-boar, urus, stag, horse, and rabbit. The breccias in\r\nthe island of Ratonneau have also furnished the porcupine, brown bear,\r\nand tailless hare. Man is proved to have been living in the district at\r\nthe time by the discovery of perforated and cut bones, in the cave of\r\nRians.\r\n\r\nThe fissures and caves of Mentone, explored by Mr. Moggridge[246] in\r\n1871, and subsequently by M. Rivière, contained a fauna composed,\r\naccording to Prof. Busk, of the following species:--\r\n\r\n    Marmot.\r\n    Field-vole.\r\n    Lion.\r\n    Panther.\r\n    Lynx.\r\n    Wild-cat.\r\n    Spotted hyæna.\r\n    Wolf.\r\n    Fox.\r\n    Brown bear.\r\n    Cave-bear.\r\n    Roe.\r\n    Stag.\r\n    Ibex.\r\n    Urus.\r\n    Horse.\r\n    Wild-boar.\r\n    _Rhinoceros hemitœchus._\r\n\r\nAlong with these were large quantities of charcoal and flint flakes,\r\nwhich proved that man had inhabited the district while the deposits\r\nwere being formed.\r\n\r\nMr. Moggridge gives the following account of the results of his\r\nexploration:--[247]\r\n\r\n“The caves of the red rocks, half a mile out of Mentone, are in lofty\r\nrocks of jurassic limestone on the shore of the Mediterranean, and at\r\nan average height of 100 feet above that sea, the rocks themselves\r\nattaining an elevation of 260 feet. They have now been repeatedly\r\nrifled by the learned or the curious; but when the principal cave\r\n(Cavillon) was nearly intact, the author made a section of it from the\r\nmodern or highest floor, down to the solid rock. There were five floors\r\nformed in the earth by long-continued trampling; on each, and near the\r\ncentre, were marks of fire, around which broken bones and flints were\r\nabundant, except upon the lowest, where but few bones occurred, and no\r\nflints. The bones were those of animals still existing. Few implements\r\nwere found, but many chips of flint, some cores and stones used as\r\nhammers. Perhaps this cave was used as a place for manufacturing\r\nflints, which must have been carried from their native bed, distant\r\nabout one mile.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to evince the action of water; on the contrary, the\r\nnumerous stones that occur are all angular.... Below these caves a\r\nslope of about 180 feet descends to the edge of the sea. Through the\r\nupper part of this slope, at distances from the cave of from 0 to ten\r\nfeet, is a railway cutting 600 feet long, fifty-four feet deep, and\r\nsixty feet above the sea. The mass removed in making this cutting was\r\ncomposed of angular stones not waterworn. Loose at the surface, it soon\r\nbecame a more or less mature breccia, for the most part so hard that it\r\nwas blasted with gunpowder.” In this breccia, and at various depths,\r\nsome of more than thirty feet, the author has taken out teeth of the\r\nbear (_Ursus spelæus_) and of the hyæna (_Hyæna spelæa_) while with and\r\nbelow those teeth he found flints worked by man.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent exploration by M. Rivière[248] has resulted in no\r\nimportant addition to the fauna: the famous human skeleton having been,\r\nas I have already remarked in the seventh chapter, interred in the\r\npleistocene strata, and probably not palæolithic. It may possibly be of\r\nthe era of the upper floors described by Mr. Moggridge, in which all\r\nthe remains belong to living species.[249]\r\n\r\nThis cave-fauna is more closely related to that of southern Europe than\r\nto that north of the Alps and Pyrenees. The striped hyæna found in\r\nthe cave of Lunel-viel, Hérault, by Marcel de Serres, along with the\r\nreindeer and other animals, probably belongs to the same southern group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-caves of Sicily._\r\n\r\nCertain members of the African fauna are also proved to have ranged\r\nnorthwards over Europe in the direction of Sicily, by the discoveries\r\nin the caves of that island. The Sicilian bone-caves have been worked\r\nfor the sake of the bones since the year 1829; and of these many\r\nshiploads were sent to Marseilles from San Ciro, belonging, according\r\nto M. de Christol, principally to the hippopotamus. In 1859,[250] Dr.\r\nFalconer examined the collections made from this cave, as well as those\r\nwhich remained _in situ_, and carried on further researches into a\r\nsecond in the neighbourhood, known as the Grotto di Maccagnone, and in\r\nthe following year two others were discovered and explored in northern\r\nSicily by Baron Anca. The species were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Homo_, man.\r\n    _Felis leo_, lion.\r\n    _Hyæna crocuta_, spotted hyæna.\r\n    _Ursus ferox_,[251] grizzly bear.\r\n    _Canis._\r\n    _Cervus_, deer.\r\n    _Bos_, ox.\r\n    _Equus_, horse.\r\n    _Sus scrofa_, boar.\r\n    _Elephas antiquus._\r\n    _Elephas Africanus_, African elephant.\r\n    _Hippopotamus major_, hippopotamus.\r\n    _Hippopotamus Pentlandi._\r\n    _Lepus._\r\n\r\nThe presence of man was indicated by charcoal and flint flakes.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant was obtained from three caves: from that of San\r\nTeodoro, by Baron Anca; from Grotta Santa, near Syracuse, by the Canon\r\nAlessi; and from a cave near Palermo, by M. Charles Gaudin. It is\r\nobvious that the presence of this animal, as well as of the spotted\r\nhyæna, in Sicily can only be accounted for on the hypothesis that a\r\nbridge of land formerly existed, by which they could pass from their\r\nhead-quarters, that is to say Africa. On the other hand the presence\r\nof the grizzly bear, and of the _Elephas antiquus_ implies that they\r\npassed over into Sicily, from their European headquarters, before the\r\nexistence of the Straits of Messina, since both animals are abundant on\r\nthe mainland of Europe. The larger species of hippopotamus, doubtfully\r\nreferred by Dr. Falconer to the _H. major_ (= _H. amphibius_), may have\r\ncrossed over either from Italy, where its remains are very abundant in\r\nthe pleiocene and pleistocene strata, or from Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Molar of _Hippopotamus Pentlandi_ (1/1).\r\n(Sicily.)]\r\n\r\nA small species of hippopotamus, _H. Pentlandi_, Fig. 127, occurs in\r\nincredible abundance in the Sicilian caves. It bears the same relation,\r\nin point of size, to the fossil variety of the African hippopotamus, as\r\nthe living _H. liberiensis_ does to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-caves of Malta._\r\n\r\nThe bone-caves of Malta were first scientifically explored by Admiral\r\nSpratt, in 1858, and subsequently by Dr. Leith Adams, and others. The\r\nMaghlak Cave near the town of Crendi, contained large quantities of the\r\n_Hippopotamus Pentlandi_, together with the gigantic dormouse, named\r\n_Myoxus Melitensis_. A short distance off a second cavern, explored by\r\nDr. Leith Adams, contained numerous remains of at least two species\r\nof pigmy elephant about the height of a small horse. Its small size\r\nmay be gathered from the accompanying woodcut (Fig. 128) of the last\r\nlower true molar, taken from the lithograph published in Dr. Falconer’s\r\n“Palæontographical Memoirs,” vol. ii. pl. xii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Molar of _Elephas Melitensis_, Malta (2/3).\r\n(Falconer.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Range of Pigmy Hippopotamus._\r\n\r\nThe pigmy hippopotamus has lived also in other districts in the\r\nMediterranean region. One of its teeth, now preserved in the British\r\nMuseum, was discovered by Dr. Leith Adams, in Candia. In 1872 I\r\nidentified in the Oxford Museum a last lower true molar, which extends\r\nthe range of this species to the mainland of Europe. It was obtained\r\nby Dr. Rolleston from a Greek tomb at Megalopolis, in the Peloponese,\r\nand was probably derived from one of the many caves in the limestone of\r\nthat district. For this extinct animal to have spread from Sicily to\r\nMalta, from Malta to Candia, and from Candia to the Peloponese, or vice\r\nversâ, these three islands must have been united to the Peloponese and\r\nhave been the higher grounds of land, now submerged beneath the waves\r\nof the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe view therefore, advanced by Dr. Falconer and Admiral Spratt, that\r\nEurope was connected with Africa by a bridge of land, extending\r\nnorthwards from Sicily, is fully borne out by an examination of the\r\nfossil remains both of that island and of Malta (see Fig. 129).[252]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossil Mammalia in Algeria._\r\n\r\nIf the African mainland extended to Europe in the direction of the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar, and of Malta and Sicily, so as to afford passage\r\nfor the African mammalia into Europe, it would equally afford passage\r\nfor the southern advance into Africa of some of the European mammalia.\r\nEvidence of this we meet with in a stratum of clay at Mansourah,\r\nnear Constantine, in Algeria, described by M. Bayle in 1854.[253]\r\nThe animals which he obtained, consisting of the ox, antelope,\r\nhippopotamus, and elephant, have been described by Prof. Gervais. An\r\nexamination of his figure of a fragment of a molar tooth leaves no room\r\nfor doubt, that the _Elephas meridionalis_ was living in north Africa\r\nduring the pleistocene age; that is to say an extinct animal, the\r\nhead-quarters of which are to be found in Italy, ranged as far south as\r\nnorthern Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Living Species common to Europe and Africa._\r\n\r\nThe former continuity of Africa by way of the Iberian peninsula and\r\nSicily, may also be inferred by the distribution of the mammalia at the\r\npresent time. Prof. Gervais[254] observes that most of the insectivora\r\nare the same in Europe and north Africa. The genette and ferret\r\n(_Fœtorius furo_), the _Mangousta Widdringtoni_ (Gray), and the fallow\r\ndeer, are common to Spain and Africa. The porcupine of Algeria belongs\r\nto the same species as that of Italy and Sicily, and the wild boar does\r\nnot present any characters of importance by which it can be separated\r\nfrom that of Europe. From the present range, therefore, of the mammalia\r\nthe same conclusion may be drawn as to the continuity of Africa with\r\nEurope as is afforded by their distribution in the pleistocene age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evidence of Soundings._\r\n\r\nThese conclusions derived from the study of the mammalia, are\r\ncorroborated and supplemented by the evidence of the soundings. As we\r\nenter the Straits of Gibraltar (Fig. 129) the Atlantic Ocean shallows,\r\nuntil between Tangiers and Tarifa it is not more than from 270 to 300\r\nfathoms. Between Tarifa and Ceuta the sea measures from 300 to 400\r\nfathoms, and thence, in passing eastwards, suddenly deepens to the\r\nextent of over 1,500 fathoms. An elevation of 400 fathoms would be\r\nquite sufficient to raise a barrier of land between Morocco and Spain,\r\nand to insulate the deep Mediterranean basin from the Atlantic. The\r\nsoundings between Sicily and Tunis are 260 fathoms; between the former\r\nplace and Malta, 55 fathoms; between Malta and the African mainland,\r\n34·4 fathoms. An elevation of 400 fathoms would suffice therefore\r\nto connect Africa with Sicily, and to insulate the eastern from the\r\nwestern Mediterranean depths. To the east of Sicily the soundings\r\nreveal a depth of over 2,000 fathoms, and this deep basin extends\r\nas far to the east as Cyprus and Asia Minor. Between Candia and the\r\nPeloponese, the sea is 460 fathoms deep. An elevation therefore\r\nfrom 400 to 500 fathoms would allow of the passage of _Hippopotamus\r\nPentlandi_ from Candia to the Peloponese, and thence by southern\r\nItaly into Sicily and Malta. I have therefore represented in the map\r\nwhat would be the necessary result of the elevation of the bottom of\r\nthe Mediterranean to that extent. Two great barriers of land would\r\nunite Africa with Spain and Italy, and enable the African mammalia to\r\nfind their way into the regions north of the Mediterranean Sea. The\r\nshallowness of the sea at those two points indicates the existence of\r\nthe sunken barriers. The African elephant however did not pass far\r\nnorthwards, since it has only been met with in Spain and Sicily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Physiography of Mediterranean in Pleistocene\r\nAge.]\r\n\r\nSuch a change in level as this would convert the Adriatic into dry\r\nland, and cause the islands of the Grecian Archipelago to rise high\r\nabove the surrounding plains. The 500-fathom line is therefore taken to\r\nrepresent the probable sea margin of the pleistocene age, although in\r\ncentres of volcanic activity, such as Sicily and the Archipelago, local\r\nchanges of level, even of greater magnitude, may have taken place.\r\n\r\nThis view of the former elevation of the Mediterranean area to a height\r\nof from two to three thousand feet above the present level will go\r\nfar to explain the remarkable traces of glaciers discovered in Syria,\r\nAnatolia, and Morocco.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Glaciers of Lebanon._\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker, in his journey to Syria in 1860, discovered that the\r\ncedars of Lebanon grew principally on one spot, on old moraines which\r\ntraverse the head of the Kedisha valley. This valley terminates in\r\nbroad, shallow, open basins at a height of about 6,000 feet above\r\nthe sea, resembling the corries of the Highlands; and one of these,\r\nin which the cedars grew, was divided into two distinct flats by a\r\ntransverse range of ancient moraines from 80 to 100 feet high and with\r\nperfectly defined boundaries. “The rills from the surrounding heights\r\ncollect in the upper flat, and form one stream, which winds among the\r\nmoraines on its way down to the lower flat, whence it is precipitated\r\ninto the gorge of the Kedisha. The cedars grow on that portion of the\r\nmoraine which immediately borders this stream, and nowhere else; they\r\nform one group about 400 yards in diameter, with an outstanding tree\r\nor two not far from the rest, and appear as a black speck in the great\r\narea of the corry and its moraines, which contain no other arborious\r\nvegetation, nor any shrubs, but a few berberry and rose bushes that\r\nform no feature in the landscape.”[255]\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, therefore, the glaciers descended to a height\r\nof about 6,000 feet above the sea, and were fed by the perennial\r\nsnow-fields of the crest of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Glaciers of Anatolia._\r\n\r\nThe former presence of glaciers at nearly the same altitude has also\r\nbeen proved by the travels of Mr. Gifford Palgrave in Anatolia,[256]\r\nespecially in the valley through which the Chorok flows, and in the\r\nmountainous country to the north-east, between Georgia and the\r\nBlack Sea. The river Chorok runs about 120 miles in a north-easterly\r\ndirection, and is separated from the Euxine by a mountain chain\r\nreaching a height of 11,000 feet, thus forming a long strip of land,\r\nwhich is called Lazistan after its inhabitants, a tribe of Lazes. It\r\nthen turns suddenly to the north, where it falls into the sea. The\r\nsouthern side is determined by mountains of Cretaceous, Jurassic, and\r\nPlutonic rocks, which form the watershed between the tributaries of\r\nthe Black Sea and Persian Gulf. Three large moraines are to be found\r\non the southern side of the valley, their lower extremity about 5,000,\r\ntheir upper origin nearly 8,000 feet above the sea. No moraines are\r\nseen where the chain does not reach an altitude of 7,000 feet, though\r\nangular boulders are not uncommon. The upper mountain contours are\r\ninvariably rounded, and smoothed off, and the sides are scooped too\r\nwidely for the depressions to have been caused by water. Low down in\r\nthe valley the slopes terminate in rifted precipices.\r\n\r\nThat these moraines were posterior to the volcanic eruptions in the\r\ndistrict, is evident from the examination of a broad stone ridge, near\r\nthe highest point to the east of Erzeroum, where at a height of 7,000\r\nfeet the Jurassic limestone was interrupted by a volcanic outbreak of\r\nseveral miles in extent. Traces of a crater were visible. Above, the\r\ngranite peaks rose to a height of 9,000 feet; below, a wide moraine\r\ncrossed the road, composed of volcanic fragments mixed with granite.\r\nConsequently, it must have been formed after the volcano had become\r\nextinct. Similar traces are to be found at Keskeem Boughaz. Mr.\r\nPalgrave concludes “that the ice-cap of the north-eastern Anatolian\r\nwatershed, in post-pleiocene (pleistocene) times, must have reached\r\ndownwards, on the northern side of the range, to 7,000 feet above the\r\npresent sea-level, while some of the glaciers issuing from it descended\r\nto about 4,500 of the same measurement.” Striated and ice-worn\r\nboulders, especially of granite, were very abundant. This region,\r\nit must be observed, is within sight of the lofty granite range of\r\nTortoom, which is “streaked with perpetual snow.”\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Chorok valley and getting on to the watershed, at\r\na distance of fifty miles to the north-east, Mr. Palgrave reached\r\nthe main ridge or backbone of the land. Here, among the limestone\r\nledges, about 6,400 feet above the sea, is a colossal moraine, formed\r\nof worn granite blocks, partly overgrown with forest, and descending\r\nfrom a height of over 8,000 feet. It is divided, by a valley, from a\r\nlofty undulating granite plateau that is scooped out here and there\r\ninto deep oval lakes, always full of blue water. The sides of the\r\nplateau are strewn with boulders of granite, brought from the higher\r\npeaks about five miles off. These boulders occur in greater or less\r\nabundance down to the basin of the Ardahan, near the sources of the\r\nKur or Cyras, which joins the Araxes before flowing into the Caspian.\r\nThe height of this Ardahan basin is about 6,500 feet; it is, but for\r\na slight easterly slope, a water level. The bottom consists of deep\r\nalluvial soil mixed with detritus and boulders; the sides are rounded\r\nand smoothed, and bear every mark of long ice-covering. These plateaux,\r\nstudded with lakes, stretch east to Russo-Georgia, till their greatest\r\nheight is gained at Kel Dagh, a mountain about 11,000 feet high: thence\r\nthey descend to the plains of Georgia and the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nNo glacial marks have been observed on the seaward side of the range,\r\nexcept at Hamshun in the Lazistan mountains, between the River Riom\r\nand Trebizond. Here, at 6,900 feet, is a granite-strewn plateau,\r\nthinly green with grass, sheltered from the sea by lofty peaks on the\r\nnorth-west, and backed to the south-east by tremendous jagged granite\r\ncliffs, the highest 12,500 feet above the sea. The plateau itself is\r\nabout forty miles in length, irregular in breadth, its surface rounded\r\nand jotted over with boulders. But just as my track led near under the\r\nbase of Verehembek, at an altitude of 8,300 feet, it crossed a large\r\nbroad moraine, descending from the higher slopes, and having its base\r\nin a broad bare valley not far below, which showed that here, at the\r\nhighest and widest part of the Lazistan chain, perpetual ice had once\r\nexisted in sufficient quantity to furnish at least one glacier. From\r\nthis case it seems that the limited ice-cap of the Hamshun highlands\r\nextended no further down than 8,500 or 9,000 feet, thus differing by\r\na line of from 1,000 to 2,000 feet from the glacial covering of the\r\ninland range.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Glaciers of the Atlas Mountains._\r\n\r\nSimilar traces of glaciers have been observed in the Atlas mountains\r\nby Mr. George Maw,[257] in his travels in Morocco with Dr. Hooker and\r\nMr. Ball in 1871. “After four hours’ continued ascent,” he writes\r\n(p. 19), “the termination of the glen comes into full view, and we\r\nobserve with great interest that it is closed by a group of moraines,\r\nproving the former existence of glaciers in the Atlas, and confirming\r\nmy opinion that the great boulder beds flanking the chain are also of\r\nglacial origin. Two villages, probably the highest in the Atlas, are\r\nbuilt on the principal moraine; Eitmasan, at its base, at a height of\r\n6,000 feet, and Arroond, near its summit, at a height of 6,800 feet;\r\nthe terminal angle of the larger moraine having a vertical height of\r\n800 feet. It is composed of immense blocks of porphyry, lying at a\r\nsteep angle of repose, up which it takes us nearly an hour to climb.\r\nThe existence of these moraines in latitude 30½° N. (the latitude of\r\nAlexandria) is perhaps the most interesting fact we noticed during our\r\njourney, for this is the most southerly point at which the evidence of\r\nextinct glaciers has been observed, and tends to confirm the opinion\r\nentertained by many geologists, that the refrigeration during the\r\nglacial period was almost Universal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glaciers probably the result of elevation above the Sea._\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the African moraines above the sea, of about 6,000\r\nfeet and upwards, is nearly the same as those of Asia Minor. If the\r\nmountains of the Atlas, Lazistan, and Lebanon shared in the upward\r\nmovement of the Mediterranean area, the addition of 3,000 feet to the\r\nheight could not fail to leave marks behind of the low temperature\r\nthereby caused. It is very probable, that during the time the\r\nMediterranean was reduced to two land-locked seas, these mountains were\r\ncovered with snow-fields, and constituted the ice-sheds of glaciers.\r\n\r\nFrom the range of the mammalia we have inferred the existence of land\r\nbarriers, extending across from Africa to Spain and Italy, and from\r\nCandia to Greece, and their actual existence beneath the sea has been\r\nproved by soundings, which necessitate an elevation of from 400 to\r\n500 fathoms to bring them above the sea-level. We have also seen\r\nthat the higher mountains, which most probably participated in this\r\nupward movement, bear traces of a lower temperature in the moraines\r\nof the Atlas and Lazistan. The hypothesis of such an elevation during\r\nthe pleistocene age may therefore be taken to be proved so far as it\r\nexplains two widely different classes of facts, the distribution of the\r\nmammals and the existence of glaciers where they are now unknown.\r\n\r\nThe physical condition of the Mediterranean area, in the pleistocene\r\nage, may be summed up as follows. The mainland of Africa extended\r\nnorthwards to join Europe, in the direction of Gibraltar and Italy.\r\nThe islands of Malta and Sicily were hilly plateaux, overlooking an\r\nundulatory plain. Corsica and Sardinia were joined to Italy, Majorca\r\nand Minorca to Spain, Candia to Peloponese, and Cyprus to Asia Minor.\r\nThe area now occupied by the Adriatic Sea constituted the lower valley\r\nof the Po, and the Archipelago was a plain studded with volcanic cones;\r\nand at the same time glaciers crowned the higher mountains of northern\r\nAfrica and of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of land for a stretch of sea, in the Mediterranean,\r\ncould not fail to cause the summer heat to be more intense in the\r\nregion to the north than at the present time, while the increased\r\nelevation would produce a greater severity of winter cold, as Mr.\r\nGodwin Austen has pointed out in the case of the hills of Devonshire.\r\nWhen, indeed, we consider that the pleistocene land surface extended\r\nfrom the snowy heights of Atlas, as far north as the 100-fathom line\r\noff the coast of Ireland, we might expect to find African animals,\r\nsuch as the spotted hyæna and _Felis caffer_, ranging as far north\r\nas Yorkshire, for the only barrier to their migration would be that\r\noffered by the severity of a pleistocene winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mediterranean Coast-line comparatively modern._\r\n\r\nThe submergence of the barriers, and the constitution of the\r\nMediterranean as we find it now, have probably taken place but a short\r\ntime ago, from the geological point of view, though we know that for\r\nthe last 3,000 years the coast-line has been on the whole unchanged,\r\nexcept from the silting out of the sea by the sediment of rivers, such\r\nas the Po, and the elevation and depression of small areas by volcanic\r\nenergy, as at Santorin. The physical character of the shores testifies\r\nto the truth of this view.\r\n\r\n“On entering the Straits of Gibraltar,” Mr. Maw writes, “from the\r\nAtlantic, a notable change takes place in the aspect of the coast. Cape\r\nSt. Vincent, on the Atlantic coast, presents a bold line of cliffs to\r\nthe sea, and bluff cliffs extend many miles towards the Straits; but\r\nas soon as these are passed, a change of coast-form takes place, which\r\nmust be noticeable to every observer. Cliffs on the sea-board become\r\nthe exception, and the general line of the coast is merely a shelving\r\nunder the sea of the general hill-and-valley system of the land, the\r\nsea running up all the depressions, and the land elevations spreading\r\nout into the sea with scarcely any abrupt cliff-line of demarcation.\r\nThe uneven sea-bottom of the Straits seems to be a continuation of the\r\ncontour of the adjacent land, consisting of rolling alternations of\r\nhill and valley, which must have received its conformation by subaerial\r\nagencies.”\r\n\r\n“Corsica, and the adjacent islands of Elba, Capraja, and Monte Christo,\r\nare also remarkable for the absence of cliffs, and are wanting in those\r\nabrupt escarpements separating land and water which are so abundant on\r\nour own coasts. Their aspect is that of mountain-tops rising out of the\r\nsea, suggesting to the eye the seaward prolongation of their subaerial\r\ncontour of sloping hillsides and river-cut valleys, as though the sea\r\nhad not stood sufficiently long at its present level to excavate an\r\nescarpement. The deep intersecting bays that occur along the coast from\r\nMarseilles to the Riviera suggest the same conclusion, the undulating\r\nland surface spreading down to the water’s edge, and the deep bays\r\nrunning up the intervening valleys, which must have had an origin\r\ncommon with that of their landward prolongations.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to shut our eyes to the full force of this reasoning.\r\nThe present aspect of the Mediterranean is, geologically speaking, a\r\nthing of yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes of Level in the Sahara coincident with those in the\r\nMediterranean._\r\n\r\nBut if the Mediterranean area has been depressed to an amount of from\r\n2,000 to 3,000 feet since the pleistocene age, we have proof that the\r\nregion to the south has been elevated to that extent in comparatively\r\nmodern times. Mr. Maw,[258] in his journey in 1873 to the Northern\r\nSahara, observed raised beaches at a height of 2,000 feet, and loam and\r\nshingle-beds as high as 2,700 feet. He therefore concludes that the\r\npart of the Sahara which he explored had been raised at least 3,000\r\nfeet above the sea. These changes of level, the same in amount, but\r\nin opposite directions, were probably compensatory and simultaneous.\r\nNorthern Africa may have been cut off from the central and southern\r\nportions of the continent by the sea extending over the Sahara, during\r\nthe time that the Mediterranean was represented by the two inland\r\nsalt lakes figured in the accompanying map (Fig. 129). And while the\r\nregion of the Sahara was being elevated, that of the Mediterranean was\r\nprobably being depressed.\r\n\r\nThese changes in the relation of sea to land, and the greater elevation\r\nof the mountains in the neighbouring countries, must have affected\r\nnot merely the climate of southern, but also of north-western Europe,\r\nand ought not to be left out of account in any theory relating to\r\npleistocene climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEAN CLIMATE IN THE PLEISTOCENE AGE.\r\n\r\n  The evidence of the Mammalia as to Climate.--The Southern Group.--\r\n    The Northern Group.--Probable cause of Association of Northern\r\n    and Southern Groups.--The Temperate Group.--Species common to\r\n    Cold and Tropical Climates.--Extinct Species.--Two Periods of\r\n    Glaciation in Britain.--Three Climatal Changes represented on\r\n    the Continent.--Europe invaded by Pleistocene Mammals before\r\n    the Glacial Period.--Mammals lived in Britain during the Second\r\n    Ice or Glacial Stage.--The Glacial Period does not separate one\r\n    Life-era from another.--Relation of Palæolithic Man to Glacial\r\n    Period.--Age of Contents of Caves in Glaciated Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Evidence of the Mammalia as to Climate._\r\n\r\nIn the last three chapters we have seen that the cave-mammalia throw\r\ngreat light on the pleistocene geography of Europe, and that there is\r\nreason for the belief that the land surface then extended northwards\r\nand westwards, so as to include Ireland; and southwards to join Africa,\r\nin the direction of Sicily, Malta, and Gibraltar. We must now pass on\r\nto the consideration of the climate on this great continental area,\r\nwhich would allow of so large and varied a fauna existing in our\r\nquarter of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Southern Group of Animals._\r\n\r\nThe pleistocene fauna is remarkable for the mixture of species. It\r\nconsists of forms now banished to South Africa, Northern Asia, and\r\nAmerica, or to the severe climate of high mountains, mingled with those\r\nwhich lived in Europe in the historic age, and those which have wholly\r\ndisappeared from the face of the earth. We will take the living species\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe southern group consists of the following animals:--\r\n\r\n    Lion.\r\n    Caffir Cat.\r\n    Spotted Hyæna.\r\n    Striped Hyæna.\r\n    Serval.\r\n    Hippopotamus.\r\n    African Elephant.\r\n    Porcupine.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the lion ranges over the whole of Africa, with the\r\nexception of Egypt and the Cape Colony, whence it has been driven out\r\nby the hand of man. In Asia, the maneless variety inhabits the valley\r\nof the Tigris and Euphrates, and the districts bordering on the Persian\r\nGulf; and in India, according to Mr. Blyth, the province of Kattywar\r\nin Guzerat. Although now only found in these hot regions, it is\r\nproved, by the concurrent testimony of Herodotus, Aristotle, Xenophon,\r\nÆlian, and Pausanias, to have inhabited the mountains of Thrace, and\r\nof Asia Minor, and it probably became extinct in Europe before the\r\nend of the first century after Christ.[259] We may therefore infer\r\nthat it possessed a sufficient elasticity of constitution to endure\r\na considerable degree of cold, although its present distribution\r\nimplies that it is better fitted to thrive in a tropical than in a cold\r\nclimate. The Caffir cat (_Felis caffer_ of Desmarest) is an African\r\nspecies, which has been discovered by Mr. Ayshford Sanford and myself,\r\nin Somersetshire; it also occurs in the caves of Germany, France, and\r\nGibraltar. The spotted hyæna now lives only in South Africa, while\r\nthe striped species ranges through Africa and the warmer regions of\r\nAsia. It was extremely rare in Europe in the pleistocene age, and\r\nhas not been identified in any deposit further north than Lunelviel,\r\nin southern France. The hippopotamus, now found only in middle and\r\nsouthern Africa, is proved by its fossil remains to have formerly dwelt\r\nin the region of the Lower Nile, as well as in Algeria. The serval and\r\nAfrican elephant have been found in the Iberian peninsula, and the\r\nlatter in Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe evidence afforded by the animals, as to the pleistocene climate of\r\nthose portions of Europe which they inhabited, differs considerably in\r\npoint of value, but on the whole indicates that it was temperate, or\r\ncomparatively hot; for although the elasticity of constitution which\r\nwe know to have been possessed by the lion, was probably shared by\r\nthe spotted hyæna, it is very unlikely that so aquatic an animal as\r\nthe hippopotamus could have ranged from southern Europe, as far north\r\nas Yorkshire, under any other than temperate conditions. It could not\r\nhave endured a winter sufficiently severe to cover the rivers with a\r\nthick coating of ice, without having its present habits profoundly\r\nmodified; and such an alteration of habits would certainly leave its\r\nmark, in other modifications in the fossil skeleton than those minute\r\ndifferences which have been observed, when it is compared with that of\r\nthe living _Hippopotamus amphibius_. The porcupine of southern Europe\r\nhas been found as far north as the caves of Belgium (Schmerling).\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Northern Group._\r\n\r\nThe northern group consists of those animals which are now only to be\r\nmet with in the colder regions of the northern hemisphere, either in\r\nlow latitudes or at great altitudes.\r\n\r\n    Marmot.\r\n    Pouched Marmot.\r\n    Lemming.\r\n    Alpine Hare.\r\n    Tailless Hare.\r\n    Glutton.\r\n    Arctic Fox.\r\n    Musk-sheep.\r\n    Reindeer.\r\n    Ibex.\r\n    Chamois.\r\n\r\nTo this list the palæolithic man of the caves must be added, since he\r\nis probably related by blood to the Eskimos, and appeared in Europe\r\nsimultaneously with the arctic group of animals.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of these animals as to climate is directly opposed to\r\nthat of the preceding group, since they now only flourish in the arctic\r\nregions, or in mountainous districts in which the climate is severe.\r\nThe marmot, in the pleistocene age, lived in Belgium, and descended\r\nfrom the Alpine heights as far as the shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere it has been met with in the caverns near Nice. The pouched\r\nmarmot, _Spermophilus citillus_ of the Don and Volga, penetrated as\r\nfar to the west as Somersetshire. The Alpine hare, now found only in\r\nthe colder climates of northern Europe, Asia, and America (with the\r\nsolitary exception of Ireland), ranged as far down the valley of the\r\nRhine as Schussenreid, in Suabia. The two carnivores now dwelling in\r\nthe colder regions of the north, the glutton or wolverine, and the\r\narctic fox, have been discovered, the one as far south as France, the\r\nother as far as Schussenreid, and both probably occupied the whole of\r\nGermany, and of northern Russia, in the pleistocene age.\r\n\r\nThe musk-sheep,[260] the most arctic in its habit of all the\r\nherbivores, is, at the present time, restricted to the high latitudes\r\nof North America, where it thrives in the desolate, treeless, barren\r\ngrounds, not even being driven from its haunts by the extreme severity\r\nof the winter. It has been traced, by its fossil remains, from its\r\npresent abode, across Behring’s Straits, and through the vast Siberian\r\nsteppes, into Russia in Europe, Germany, Britain, and as far south and\r\nwest as the barrier offered by the Pyrenees. Throughout this large area\r\nits remains occur in association with the reindeer, and both these\r\nanimals, as I have remarked above, were hunted by the palæolithic\r\ndwellers in the caves of Aquitaine, just as they are now hunted by the\r\nEskimos on the shores of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIf the present habits of these animals be any index to their mode\r\nof life in the pleistocene age, their presence in the area north of\r\nthe Alps and Pyrenees implies that the climate in France, Germany,\r\nand Britain was severe, or analogous to that which they now enjoy\r\non the tops of lofty mountains, or in the northern Asiatic steppes,\r\nor the high northern latitudes of America. But this conclusion is\r\ndiametrically opposed to that which is based on the evidence of the\r\nsouthern group of animals.[261] And the remains of the two groups of\r\nanimals are so associated together in the caves, and river-deposits of\r\nEurope, north of the Pyrenees, that it is impossible to deny the fact\r\nthat it was the common feeding-ground of both during the same era.[262]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Probable Cause of Association of Northern and Southern Groups._\r\n\r\nMust we then infer that in the pleistocene age the present habits of\r\nthe musk-sheep, the reindeer, chamois, or ibex, were so changed as to\r\nallow them to flourish side by side with the hippopotamus, or _vice\r\nversâ_? Was the climate colder than it is now in Europe, or was it\r\nhotter? How was this singular association of northern and southern\r\nspecies brought about? The problem may be solved if we refer to the\r\npresent distribution of animals in northern Asia and North America. As\r\nthe winter comes on the arctic species gradually retreat southwards,\r\nand occupy the summer feeding-grounds of the elk, red-deer, and other\r\ncreatures which are unable to endure the extreme severity of an arctic\r\nwinter. In the spring the latter pass northwards, to enjoy the summer\r\nherbage of that area, which had been the winter-quarters of the\r\narctic group of animals. Thus there is a continued swinging to and\r\nfro, over the same region, of the arctic and the temperate animals,\r\nand their remains must necessarily become more or less associated in\r\nthe river-deposits, as well as in caves, where these last happen to\r\noccur. In northern Asia, and in America, the only boundary between the\r\nnorthern and temperate zoological provinces is that constituted by the\r\nfluctuating annual temperature, and there are no great hilly barriers\r\nrunning east and west, to prevent free migration to the north or south.\r\nIf reference be made to the map, Fig. 126, it will be seen that these\r\nconditions were amply satisfied in the pleistocene age. There were no\r\nphysical barriers to migration, from the shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nas far north as Ireland. If the winter cold were severe, the reindeer\r\nand musk-sheep might advance as far south as the Pyrenees, and if\r\nthe summer heat were intense there would be nothing to forbid the\r\nhippopotamus and the African carnivores advancing northwards. It seems\r\nto me that this is the only hypothesis which will satisfy all the facts\r\nof the case. The traces of glaciers and snow-fields where they are no\r\nlonger found prove that the winter was severe; while the warmth of the\r\nsummer seems to be sufficiently demonstrated by the presence of African\r\nspecies. Such extremes of temperature are presented, more or less, by\r\nall continents extending from high to low latitudes. They are modified\r\nin Europe at the present time by the warm current of the Gulf Stream,\r\nby the large area now occupied by the Mediterranean Sea, and by the\r\nsubmergence of the pleistocene lowlands on the Atlantic border.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Temperate Group._\r\n\r\nThe third group of pleistocene mammalia consists of those still living\r\nin the temperate zones of Europe, Asia, and America:\r\n\r\n    Beaver.\r\n    Hare.\r\n    Rabbit.\r\n    Wild Cat.\r\n    Martin.\r\n    Stoat.\r\n    Weasel.\r\n    Otter.\r\n    Brown Bear.\r\n    Grizzly Bear.\r\n    Wolf.\r\n    Fox.\r\n    Horse.\r\n    Urus.\r\n    Bison.\r\n    _Antelope saiga._\r\n    Wild Boar.\r\n    Stag.\r\n    Roe.\r\n\r\nThe range of many of these animals has been profoundly modified since\r\nthe pleistocene age. The _Antelope saiga_ of the Don and Volga lived\r\nas far to the west as Aquitaine. The grizzly bear, instead of being\r\nrestricted to its American habitat in the Rocky Mountains, ranged\r\nover the whole of Siberia into Europe, as far to the south as the\r\nMediterranean, and westwards as far as Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe urus[263] still lives in the larger domestic cattle, and the bison\r\nis represented in Europe by those which are protected by the forest\r\nlaws of Lithuania, and in North America by the vast herds which are\r\nrapidly being exterminated, like the red Indian, by the rifles of the\r\nsettlers. The horse was as abundant, and as widely spread over Europe,\r\nas the urus and the bison; according to Prof. Brandt it now no longer\r\nlives in Siberia in a wild state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Species common to Cold and Tropical Climates._\r\n\r\nThe panther or leopard, which has been found alike in Britain, France,\r\nand Germany, has at the present day a most extended range through\r\nAfrica, from Barbary to the Cape of Good Hope, and throughout Persia\r\ninto Siberia. In this latter country Dr. Gothelf Fischer describes\r\nit as living in the same districts in the Altai Mountains, and in\r\nSoongaria, as the tiger. The fox and wolf are like instances of\r\ncarnivores being able to endure great variations in temperature without\r\nbeing specifically modified. These three animals, therefore, tell us\r\nnothing as to the pleistocene climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinct Species._\r\n\r\nThe extinct pleistocene species may also be divided into the same\r\nclasses as the living, by an appeal to their geographical distribution.\r\nTwo out of the three species of rhinoceros found in the caves (_R.\r\nmegarhinus_ and _R. hemitœchus_), and an elephant with slightly curved\r\ntusks (_E. antiquus_), had their head-quarters south of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees, whence they wandered northward as far as the latitude of\r\nYorkshire. The pigmy elephant and the dwarf hippopotamus are peculiar\r\nto the south, and the _Machairodus latidens_, or large sabre-toothed\r\nfelis, is a survival, from the pleiocene age, of a peculiarly southern\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe woolly rhinoceros, on the other hand, may be viewed as a northern\r\nform, since it is met with in vast abundance in the arctic regions\r\nof Siberia, as well as in Europe, and has not been found south of\r\nthe Alps and Pyrenees. The cave-bear has not been discovered either\r\nin the extreme north or in the south of Europe, and may therefore be\r\nconsidered of temperate range; and the Irish elk, identified by Prof.\r\nBrandt, from the caves of the Altai Mountains, had a similar range in\r\nmiddle Europe. The mammoth, endowed with an elastic constitution, was\r\nable to endure the severity of an arctic climate in Siberia and North\r\nAmerica, and the temperature of the latitude of Rome and the Gulf of\r\nMexico,[264] and consequently tells us as little of the pleistocene\r\nclimate as the panther, fox, or wolf.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, therefore, as to climate, offered by the extinct animals\r\nin the caves is of the same nature as that of the living. There is\r\nthe same mixture of northern and southern forms, which can only be\r\naccounted for satisfactorily by seasonal migrations, according to the\r\nsummer heat and winter cold, such as those which are now observed to\r\ntake place in Siberia and North America.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the relation of the pleistocene animals buried in\r\nthe caves and river deposits to the glacial period, it is necessary to\r\ndefine what is meant by the term glacial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Two Periods of Glaciation in Britain._\r\n\r\nAt the close of the pleistocene period the climate gradually became\r\ncolder, until ultimately it was arctic in severity in northern Europe.\r\nThe researches of many eminent observers prove that an enormous sheet\r\nof ice, like that under which Greenland now lies buried, extended\r\nover North Britain, Wales, and Ireland, leaving its mark in the\r\nfar-travelled blocks of stone, the moraines, and the grooves which pass\r\nover the surface irrespective of the minor contours. The land then,\r\nmost probably, as Prof. Ramsay and Sir Charles Lyell believe, stood\r\nhigher than it does now. To this succeeded a period of depression,\r\nduring which the mountains of Wales were submerged to a height of\r\nat least 1,300 feet; and the waves of the sea washed out of the\r\npre-existing glacial detritus the shingle and sand, termed the “middle\r\ndrift,” which occurs also in Scotland and Ireland.[265] Then the land\r\nwas re-elevated above the waves, and a second period of glaciers set\r\nin, traces of which occur abundantly in Wales, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nin the white areas in Fig. 126. They were, however, of far less extent\r\nthan those which preceded them, occupying isolated areas instead\r\nof forming one continuous icy covering to the country. The glacial\r\nphenomena may be briefly summed up as follows: 1. As the pleiocene\r\ntemperature was lowered, the glaciers crept down from the tops of the\r\nmountains, until at last they united to form one continuous ice sheet,\r\nmoving resistlessly over the smaller hills and valleys to the lower\r\ngrounds, and the first ice or glacial period set in. 2. Then followed\r\nthe era of depression beneath the sea. 3. And, lastly, on the land\r\nre-emerging from the sea the second ice or glacial period began. The\r\nclimate during the marine depression must obviously have been milder\r\nthan that of either of the glacial periods, because of the moderating\r\neffect of the wide extent of sea.\r\n\r\nThe exact relation of the boulder clays with marine shells, in the\r\ncentre and south of Britain, to the detritus left behind by the\r\nice-sheet in the north, has not as yet been satisfactorily ascertained.\r\nIt is very probable that the elevation of land in the north was\r\nsimultaneous with a southern depression, which allowed of icebergs\r\ndepositing their burdens in the eastern counties, in the valley of the\r\nThames, and as far south as Selsea, on the coast of Sussex.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three Climatal Changes represented on the Continent._\r\n\r\nThese changes of climate have also been observed on the continent\r\nof Europe. The Swiss geologists have shown that the Alpine glaciers\r\nextended farther than they do at the present time, and that they\r\npresent two stages of extension, the first of which is of greater\r\nmagnitude than the second. The Alpine blocks and moraines have been\r\ntraced far down into the plains of Lombardy, northwards into the\r\nvalley of the Rhine, and in France as far south in the valley of the\r\nRhone as Valence. The admirable essay and map brought by MM. Falsan\r\nand Chantre, before the meeting of the French Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science at Lyons, in 1873, show that there were two\r\nperiods of glaciation in the valley of the Rhone, the one being due to\r\nthe movement of an ice-sheet irrespective of the lower hills, the other\r\nbeing merely the work of the glaciers localized in the valleys. These\r\nin all probability correspond in point of time with the like stages of\r\nthe complicated glacial phenomena in Britain. At this time the glaciers\r\nof the Pyrenees, now so small, extended at least from thirty to forty\r\nmiles from their present position down into the plains, leaving behind\r\nmost astounding evidences of their presence in the valley of the\r\nGaronne and elsewhere. On the Spanish frontier, for example, one of the\r\nprecipitous sides of the valley, near the Pont du Roy, is so smoothed\r\nand polished that it is bare of vegetation except in the deep grooves,\r\nwhich offer a precarious support to the roots of ferns and of dwarf\r\nbeeches. The hills of Dauphiny also and Auvergne were crowned with\r\nglaciers, and those of the latter have been shown by MM. Falsan and\r\nChantre to have been conterminous with those of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe interglacial period of marine depression in Britain is represented\r\nin Switzerland by the lignite beds of Dürnten, Utznach, and Pfaffikon,\r\nthe last of which rests upon and is covered by the boulder drift. The\r\nfossil remains from Dürnten, identified by Dr. Falconer and Prof.\r\nRütimeyer, prove that two southern animals, _Elephas antiquus_ and\r\n_Rhinoceros megarhinus_, inhabited the district in the interval between\r\nthe retreat of one set of glaciers and the advance of another. They\r\nprobably migrated from the plains of Lombardy, where they abounded in\r\nthe pleistocene age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Europe invaded by Pleistocene Mammals before the Glacial Period._\r\n\r\nWhat is the precise relation of the pleistocene mammals to these two\r\nperiods of cold? Did they invade northern and central Europe during\r\nthe first or the second, before or after, the marine submergence\r\nindicated by the “middle drift?” We might expect, _à priori_, that as\r\nthe temperature became lowered, the northern mammalia would gradually\r\ninvade the region occupied before by the pleiocene forms, and that the\r\nreindeer, the mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros would gradually supplant\r\nthe southern _Rhinoceros Etruscus_ and _Elephas meridionalis_. Traces\r\nof such an occupation would necessarily be very rare, since they would\r\nbe exposed to the grinding action both of the advancing glacial sheet,\r\nand subsequently to that of the waves on the littoral zone during the\r\ndepression and re-elevation of the land. At the time also that the\r\ngreater part of Great Britain was buried under an ice-sheet, it could\r\nnot have been occupied by animals, although they may have been, and\r\nmost probably were, living in the districts farther to the south,\r\nwhich were not covered by ice. The labours, however, of Dr. Bryce,\r\nProf. Archibald Geikie, and others prove that one at least of the\r\ncharacteristic pleistocene mammalia--the mammoth--lived in Scotland\r\nalong with the reindeer before the deposit of the lower boulder-clay;\r\nwhile Mr. Jamieson has pointed out that it could not have occupied\r\nthat area at the same time as the ice, and therefore must be referred\r\nto a still earlier date.[266] The teeth and bones discovered in the\r\nancient land surface at Selsea, under the boulder drift, also very\r\nprobably indicate that the mammoth lived in Sussex before the glacial\r\nsubmergence, although they were never admitted by Dr. Falconer to be\r\nof the same age as the remains of _Elephas antiquus_ from the same\r\npreglacial horizon. The animal also occurs in the preglacial forest-bed\r\nof Norfolk and Suffolk. On a careful examination of the whole evidence,\r\nI am compelled to believe, with Mr. Godwin-Austen and Prof. Phillips,\r\nthat the _à priori_ belief that the pleistocene mammalia occupied\r\nGreat Britain before the period of the ice-sheet and submergence is\r\nfully borne out by the few incontestable proofs that have been brought\r\nforward of the remains being found in preglacial deposits. And the\r\nscanty evidence on the point is just what might be expected from the\r\nrare accidents under which the bones in superficial deposits could have\r\nwithstood the grinding of the ice-sheet, and the subsequent erosive\r\naction of the waves on the coast-line. It may therefore be concluded,\r\nthat the pleistocene mammalia arrived in Europe before the temperature\r\nhad reached its minimum in the glacial period. On the other hand, the\r\noccurrence of mammaliferous river strata, either in hollows of the\r\nboulder-clay as at Hoxne, or in valleys excavated after its deposition\r\nas at Bedford, prove that the characteristic animals occupied Britain\r\nafter the retreat of the ice-sheet, and after the re-emergence of the\r\nland from beneath the glacial sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mammalia lived in Britain during the Second Ice or Glacial Period._\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the animals in the river deposits gives us a clue\r\nto the physical geography during the second ice period. In an essay\r\nread before the Geological Society in 1869, and in a second printed\r\nin the “Popular Science Review” in 1872, I showed that there was a\r\nsingular irregularity in the contents of the river strata, and that\r\nwhile the fossil mammalia were abundant throughout the area (marked\r\nwith dots in the map, Fig. 126), there were certain districts in which\r\nthey had not been met with. One of these barren areas comprises (plain\r\nin the map, Fig. 126), nearly the whole of Wales. A second includes a\r\nlarge portion of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and\r\nthe whole of Scotland (if the preglacial mammals in the low district\r\nbetween the Frith of Forth and Frith of Clyde in the map be omitted),\r\nand a third is represented by nearly the whole of Ireland. These areas\r\nare remarkable for the absence of the mammalia from the river deposits.\r\nThey are also characterised by the freshness of the ice marks which\r\nthey present. Nearly every valley has its own system of grooves and its\r\nown set of moraines; and the mounds of clay and marl left behind by the\r\nlocal glacier, as it slowly retreated to higher levels till it finally\r\ndisappeared, are to be observed in great abundance. If we bring these\r\nfacts into relation, the barrenness of the areas may be reasonably\r\nexplained by the presence of glaciers, _while_ the pleistocene mammals\r\nwere living in the south and east (see map, Fig. 126). A barrier of\r\nsome kind may reasonably be inferred to have prevented their range over\r\nthose districts, and its nature is indicated by the ice marks. It is\r\nvery probable that these glaciers had not passed away before the close\r\nof the pleistocene age: for in that case the characteristic animals\r\nwould be discovered in the river gravels, which are later than the\r\ndeposits of local glaciers in those districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Glacial Period does not separate one Life-era from another._\r\n\r\nThe lowering of the temperature which culminated in the glacial period\r\nhas left palpable traces behind in the changes which it caused in the\r\nEuropean fauna. As the pleiocene climate became colder, the animals\r\nunfitted to endure the cold, such as the deer of the Indian types of\r\nAxis and Rusa, either migrated to the south or became extinct, while\r\ntheir feeding-grounds were invaded by the dwellers in the temperate\r\nzone, the stag, roe, bison, and other animals. These in their turn were\r\npushed forward by the arctic group of animals, the musk-sheep, lemming,\r\nreindeer, and others, the progress being in the main steadily to the\r\nsouth while the cold was increasing, and the retreat being steadily to\r\nthe north while it was decreasing. It will follow from this, that the\r\nsame district in central or north-western Europe would be traversed by\r\nthese migratory bodies of animals, both in their southern advance in\r\npreglacial and glacial times and their northern retreat in postglacial\r\ntimes, and that, therefore, their fossil remains cannot afford a\r\nmeans of fixing the preglacial, glacial, or postglacial, age of the\r\ndeposit in which they are found, where it is not marked by traces of\r\nglaciation. Sir Charles Lyell’s view, that the glacial period cannot be\r\ntaken as a landmark in the classification of the European pleistocene\r\ndeposits, is fully borne out by the facts, and still less can it be\r\ntaken as a hard and fast line between one fauna and another. It cannot\r\nbe considered a life-era like the eocene, meiocene, pleiocene, or\r\nprehistoric divisions of the tertiary period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bone-caves inhabited before and after Ice Period._\r\n\r\nIf we allow that the lowering of the temperature was the principal\r\ncause of the presence of temperate and arctic animals, in a region\r\nbefore inhabited by species fitted to live in a comparatively warm\r\nclimate, it will follow that bone-caves cannot be said to be either\r\npre- or postglacial, by an appeal to their fossil mammalia. If they\r\nwere open before the minimum of temperature was reached, they would\r\nafford shelter to the animals then in the neighbourhood, and they would\r\ncontinue to be occupied in the south during the vast period of time\r\nrepresented by the enormous physical changes in the region north of\r\nthe line of the Thames, during the development of the ice-sheet, the\r\nsubmergence and the re-elevation of nearly the whole of Britain and\r\nIreland. As, however, the cold increased, the percentage of arctic\r\nanimals would also increase, and the more temperate species be weeded\r\nout. For these reasons it has seemed to me, that the machairodus of\r\nKent’s Hole, and the _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ of Oreston, represent\r\nan early stage of the pleistocene period, before the arctic mammalia\r\nwere present in full force in the caves. It is very probable that vast\r\nherds of reindeer lived in the south of France, while northern Britain\r\nlay buried under the ice-sheet, as well as during the two succeeding\r\nphysical changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of Palæolithic Man to Glacial Period._\r\n\r\nWhat then is the relation of the palæolithic hunter of reindeer in\r\nFrance and Britain to the glacial period? Is he pre- or postglacial?\r\nThe only evidence on the point is that offered by the associated\r\nmammalia which occupied France, Germany, and Britain before and after\r\nthe point of minimum temperature was reached in these latitudes. Man\r\nmay have inhabited the caves not merely of France, but of Devonshire\r\nand Somerset, at any time during that long period. The position of the\r\npalæolithic refuse-heap discovered by Prof. Fraas at Schussenreid,\r\nresting on a moraine of the extinct glacier of the Rhine, proves that\r\nthe palæolithic Eskimos lived in Suabia after the retreat of the\r\nglacier when the temperature became warmer, towards the close of the\r\npleistocene age or in the later glacial stage. The same conclusion\r\nhas been arrived at by Mr. Prestwich as to the sojourn of palæolithic\r\nman (of the river-bed type) in Bedfordshire and Suffolk, the gravels\r\nin which the implements are found being of a later age than the\r\nboulder-clay of those districts. We have therefore proof that man\r\nlived in Germany and Britain after the maximum glacial cold had passed\r\naway, and we may also infer with a high degree of probability that\r\nhe migrated into Europe along with the pleistocene mammalia in the\r\npreglacial age.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Test of age of contents of caves in Glaciated Districts._\r\n\r\nThe probable date of the introduction of the contents into ossiferous\r\ncaves in glaciated areas may be ascertained by an examination of\r\nthe river deposits. If the animals found in the caves inhabited the\r\nsurrounding country after the melting of the ice, their remains will\r\noccur in the postglacial gravels. If they are not found, it may be\r\ninferred that they had retreated from the district, before the latter\r\nwere deposited. It is obvious that they could not have lived in any\r\ndistrict while it was covered with ice or by the sea. It may therefore\r\nbe concluded that their remains in the caves were most probably\r\nintroduced before the glacial conditions had set in. Preglacial\r\ndeposits in a cavern would be protected from the grinding of the\r\nice-sheet, the action of the waves in the depression, and re-elevation\r\nof the land, and the subsequent glacial erosion which would inevitably\r\ndestroy nearly all the fluviatile ossiferous strata. By this test the\r\npleistocene strata in the Victoria Cave, near Settle, may be considered\r\npreglacial, as well as the hyæna-den at Kirkdale, which has always been\r\nreferred by Prof. Phillips to that age. If this be allowed, the small\r\nfragment of human bone found by the Settle Cave Exploration Committee\r\nin the former cave in 1872 establishes the fact that man lived in\r\nYorkshire before the glacial period. The man to whom it belonged was\r\nprobably devoured by the hyænas which dragged into their den the woolly\r\nrhinoceros, reindeer, and other creatures whose gnawed bones were\r\nstrewn on the floors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n  Classification of Pleistocene Strata by means of the Mammalia.--The\r\n    late, middle, and early Pleistocene Divisions.--The Pleiocene\r\n    Mammalia.--Summary of characteristic Pleiocene and Pleistocene\r\n    Species.--Antiquity of Man in Europe.--Man lived in India\r\n    in Pleistocene Age.--Are the Palæolithic Aborigines of India\r\n    related to those of Europe?--Palæolithic Man lived in Palestine.--\r\n    Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals inhabiting the caves have been enumerated in the last\r\nthree chapters, and we have discussed the inferences drawn from their\r\ndistribution as to the pleistocene climate and geography of Europe. It\r\nremains for us now, in conclusion, to define the pleistocene, and to\r\nsee in what relation it stands to the pleiocene period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of Pleistocene Strata by means of the Mammalia._\r\n\r\nThe pleistocene period was one of very long duration, and embraced\r\nchanges of great magnitude in the geography of Europe, as we have seen\r\nin the ninth and tenth chapters. The climate, which in the preceding\r\npleiocene age had been temperate in northern and middle Europe, at the\r\nbeginning of the pleistocene gradually passed into the extreme arctic\r\nseverity of the glacial period. This change caused a corresponding\r\nchange of the forms of animal life; the pleiocene species, whose\r\nconstitutions were adjusted to temperate or hot climates, yielding\r\nplace to those which were better adapted to the new conditions. And\r\nsince there is reason for the belief that it was not continuous in\r\none direction, but that there were pauses or even reversions towards\r\nthe old temperate state, it follows that the two groups of animals\r\nwould at times overlap, and their remains be intermingled with each\r\nother. The frontiers also of each of the geographical provinces must\r\nnaturally have varied with the season; and the competition for the\r\nsame feeding-grounds between the invading and retreating forms must\r\nhave been long, fluctuating, and severe. The passage, therefore, from\r\nthe pleiocene to the pleistocene fauna might be expected to have been\r\nextremely gradual in each area. The lines of definition between the\r\ntwo are to a great extent arbitrary, instead of being marked with\r\nsufficient strength to constitute a barrier between the tertiary and\r\npost-tertiary groups of life of Lyell, or between the tertiary and\r\nquaternary of French geologists. The principle of classification which\r\nI have proposed[267] is that offered by the gradual lowering of the\r\ntemperature, which has left its mark in the advent of animals before\r\nunknown in Europe; and according to it I have divided the pleistocene\r\ndeposits into three groups.\r\n\r\n1. Those in which the pleistocene immigrants had begun to disturb\r\nthe pleiocene mammalia, but had not yet supplanted the more southern\r\nanimals. No arctic mammalia had as yet arrived. To this group belongs\r\nthe forest-bed of Norfolk and Suffolk, and the deposit at St. Prest,\r\nnear Chartres.\r\n\r\n2. That in which the characteristic pleiocene deer had disappeared. The\r\neven-toed ruminants are principally represented by the stag, the Irish\r\nelk, the roe, bison, and urus. _Elephas meridionalis_ and _Rhinoceros\r\netruscus_ had retreated to the south. To this group belong the\r\nbrick-earths of the lower valley of the Thames, the river-deposit at\r\nClacton, the cave of Baume in the Jura, and a river-deposit in Auvergne.\r\n\r\n3. The third division is that in which the true arctic mammalia were\r\namong the chief inhabitants of the region; and to it belong most of the\r\nossiferous caves and river-deposits in middle and northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThese three do not correspond with the preglacial, glacial, and\r\npostglacial divisions of the pleistocene strata, in central and north\r\nBritain; since there is reason to believe that all the animals which\r\noccupied Britain after the maximum cold had passed away, had arrived\r\nhere in their southern advance before that maximum cold had been\r\nreached; or, in other words, were both pre- and postglacial.\r\n\r\nThis classification does not apply to pleistocene river-strata south of\r\nthe Alps and Pyrenees, into which the arctic mammalia never penetrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Late Pleistocene Division._\r\n\r\nThe late pleistocene division corresponds in part with the reindeer\r\nperiod of M. Lartet; but it comprehends also his other three periods;\r\nfor the spotted hyæna, the lion, the cave-bear, the mammoth, the woolly\r\nrhinoceros, the bison, the reindeer, and the urus are so associated\r\ntogether in the caves and river deposits of Great Britain and the\r\ncontinent that they do not afford a means of classification. The\r\narctic division of the mammalia, defined in the preceding chapter, was\r\nthen in full possession of the area north of the Alps and Pyrenees, and\r\nthe _Rhinoceros megarhinus_ and _Elephas meridionalis_ had disappeared.\r\nWith three exceptions, to be noticed presently, all the ossiferous\r\ncaverns of France, Germany, and Britain, belong to this division of the\r\npleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Middle Pleistocene Division._\r\n\r\nThe middle division of the pleistocene mammalia may now be examined,\r\nor that from which the characteristic pleiocene deer had vanished,\r\nand were replaced by the invading forms from the temperate zones of\r\nnorthern Asia. It is represented in Britain by the mammalia obtained\r\nfrom the lower brick-earths of the Thames valley, at Crayford, Erith,\r\nIlford, and Gray’s Thurrock, by those from the deposit at Clacton, and\r\nmost probably by those of the older deposit in Kent’s Hole, and by the\r\n_Rhinoceros megarhinus_ of Oreston.[268] They consist of--\r\n\r\n    Man, _Homo_.\r\n    Lion, _Felis leo spelæa_.\r\n    Wild Cat, _F. catus_.\r\n    Spotted Hyæna, _Hyæna crocuta var. spelæa_.\r\n    Grizzly Bear, _Ursus ferox_.\r\n    Brown Bear, _U. arctos_.\r\n    Wolf, _Canis lupus_.\r\n    Fox, _C. vulpes_.\r\n    Otter, _Lutra vulgaris_.\r\n    Urus, _Bos primigenius_.\r\n    Bison, _Bison priscus_.\r\n    Irish Elk, _Cervus megaceros_.\r\n    Stag, _C. elaphus_.\r\n    Brown’s Fallow Deer, _C. Browni_.\r\n    Roedeer, _C. capreolus_.\r\n    Musk Sheep, _Ovibos moschatus_.\r\n    _Elephas antiquus._\r\n    Mammoth, _E. primigenius_.\r\n    Horse, _Equus caballus_.\r\n    Woolly Rhinoceros, _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_.\r\n    _R. hemitœchus._\r\n    _R. megarhinus._\r\n    Wild-boar, _Sus scrofa_.\r\n    Hippopotamus, _Hippopotamus amphibius_.\r\n    Beaver, _Castor fiber_.\r\n    Water-Rat, _Arvicola amphibia_.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a flint-flake in the undisturbed lower brick-earths\r\nof Crayford, by the Rev. O. Fisher, in the presence of the writer, in\r\nApril 1872, proves that man was living while these fluviatile strata\r\nwere being deposited.\r\n\r\nIf these mammalia be compared with those of the forest-bed or the\r\npleiocene age on the one hand, and with the late pleistocene on\r\nthe other, it will be seen that they are linked to the former by\r\n_Rhinoceros megarhinus_, and to the latter by the musk sheep. The\r\npresence of the latter, the most arctic of the herbivores, in such\r\nstrange company is most abnormal, and suggests the idea that the\r\nremains belong to two distinct eras. The skull, however, which I found\r\nat Crayford in 1867, and presented to the Museum of the Geological\r\nSurvey, rested in intimate association with the bones of other species,\r\nis in the same mineral state, and bears no marks of being a “derived\r\nfossil.” It is the only trace of the animal as yet obtained from the\r\nlower brick-earths.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the reindeer, so numerous in the valley of the Thames,\r\nwhile the late pleistocene strata were being accumulated by the\r\nriver, and the abundance of remains of the stag, seem to me to point\r\nbackwards rather than forwards in time, and to imply that the lower\r\nbrick-earths are not of late pleistocene age; just as the absence\r\nof the characteristic early pleistocene species shows that they are\r\nnot of that age. The evidence seems to be sufficient to establish a\r\nstage intermediate between the two. Nevertheless, it is sufficiently\r\nconflicting to cause Dr. Falconer to come to the conclusion that these\r\nstrata are of pleiocene date, and Mr. Prestwich to believe that they\r\nbelong to a late stage in the pleistocene.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle pleistocene, in the Thames valley, and at Clacton,\r\nthe woolly rhinoceros, elephant, and mammoth competed for the same\r\nfeeding-grounds with _Rhinoceros hemitœchus_, _R. megarhinus_,\r\nhippopotamus, and _Elephas antiquus_. Although all the characteristic\r\npleiocene deer had retreated, the reindeer had not yet invaded that\r\narea: it was occupied by the stag, roe, the Irish elk, and Brown’s\r\nfallow deer. The whole assemblage of animals, the musk sheep being\r\nexcepted, implies that the climate was less severe at this time, than\r\nwhen the reindeer spread over the same area in the late pleistocene\r\nage, and was far more numerous than the stag. It may, indeed, be\r\nobjected that the classificatory value of the musk sheep is quite as\r\ngreat as that of _Rhinoceros megarhinus_; but in the case of the lower\r\nbrick-earths, the evidence of the latter as to climate agrees with\r\nthat of the whole assemblage of animals, while that of the former is\r\naltogether discordant.\r\n\r\nThere are no caves either in Britain or on the continent which can\r\nbe referred with certainty to this middle division. The machairodus,\r\nhowever, of Kent’s Hole, and of the cavern of Baume in the Jura (see\r\np. 337), and the megarhine species of rhinoceros from the fissures of\r\nOreston, probably inhabited those regions, while the temperate group of\r\nanimals held possession of the valley of the Thames, and of that now\r\nsunk beneath the North Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Early Pleistocene Mammalia._\r\n\r\nThe fossil mammalia must now be examined, which inhabited Great Britain\r\nduring the early pleistocene period, and before the maximum severity\r\nof glacial cold had as yet been reached. The fossil bones from the\r\nforest-bed, which underlies the boulder-clay on the shores of Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk, have for many years attracted the attention of naturalists\r\nand geologists. The magnificent collections of the Rev. John Gunn, and\r\nthe late Rev. S. W. King, gave Dr. Falconer the means of proving that\r\nthe fauna of the ancient submerged forest differed from that of any\r\ngeological period which we have hitherto discussed: and the careful\r\ndiagnosis of all the fossils from this horizon which I have been able\r\nto meet with, shows that it was of a very peculiar character, being\r\nclosely allied to the pleiocene of the south of France and of Italy,\r\nand yet possessing species which are undoubtedly pleistocene. The\r\nfollowing list is necessarily very imperfect, since the fragmentary\r\nnature of the fossils renders a specific identification very hazardous;\r\nand it only includes those which I have been able to identify with any\r\ndegree of certainty.\r\n\r\n    _Sorex moschatus._\r\n    _S. vulgaris._\r\n    _Talpa Europæa._\r\n    _Trogontherium Cuvieri._\r\n    _Castor fiber._\r\n    _Ursus spelæus._\r\n    _U. arvernensis._\r\n    _Canis lupus._\r\n    _C. vulpes._\r\n    _Machairodus._\r\n    _Cervus megaceros._\r\n    _C. capreolus._\r\n    _C. elaphus._\r\n    _Cervus Polignacus._\r\n    _C. carnutorum._\r\n    _C. verticornis._\r\n    _C. Sedgwickii._\r\n    _Bos primigenius._\r\n    _Hippopotamus major._\r\n    _Sus scrofa._\r\n    _Equus caballus._\r\n    _Rhinoceros etruscus._\r\n    _R. megarhinus._\r\n    _Elephas meridionalis._\r\n    _E. antiquus._\r\n    _E. primigenius._\r\n\r\nFrom the examination of this list, the peculiar mixture of pleiocene\r\nand pleistocene species is evident. The _Ursus arvernensis_, _Cervus\r\nPolignacus_, _Hippopotamus major_, _Rhinoceros etruscus_, and _R.\r\nmegarhinus_, the horse, _Elephas meridionalis_, and _E. antiquus_\r\nwere living in the pleiocene age in France and Italy, and probably in\r\nNorfolk. The cave-bear, the wolf, fox, mole, beaver, Irish elk, roe,\r\nstag, urus, wild-boar, and the mammoth have not as yet been discovered\r\nin the continental pleiocenes, as judged by the standards offered by\r\nthe Val d’Arno and Southern France. They are more or less abundant in\r\nthe late pleistocene age. This singular association seems to me to\r\nimply that the fauna of the forest-bed is intermediate between the two,\r\nand, from the fact that only three out of the whole series, viz. _Ursus\r\narvernensis_, _Rhinoceros etruscus_, and _Cervus Polignacus_, are\r\npeculiar to the continental pleiocene, that it is more closely allied\r\nto the pleistocene than to the pleiocene.\r\n\r\nIt is also very probable that this early pleistocene age was of\r\nconsiderable duration; for in it we find at least two forms (and the\r\nnumber will probably be very largely increased) which are unknown in\r\ncontinental Europe, although pleiocene and pleistocene strata have\r\nbeen diligently examined in France and Germany. The very presence of\r\nthe _Cervus Sedgwickii_ and _C. verticornis_ implies that the lapse\r\nof time was sufficiently great to allow of the evolution of forms of\r\nanimal life hitherto unknown, and which disappeared before the middle\r\nand late pleistocene stages. The _Trogontherium_ also, as well as the\r\n_Cervus carnutorum_, both of which occur in the forest-bed and in the\r\ngravel-beds of St. Prest, near Chartres, and which are peculiar to this\r\nhorizon, point to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe deer of the forest-bed, in this list, do not represent\r\napproximately the number of species: there are at least five, and\r\nperhaps six, represented by a series of antlers, which I do not venture\r\nto quote, because I have not been able to compare them with those of\r\nthe pleiocenes of the Val d’Arno, of Marseilles, or of Auvergne.\r\n\r\nDr. Falconer pointed out that one of the peculiar characters of the\r\nfauna of the forest-bed is the presence of the mammoth; and the\r\nevidence on which he considered the animal to be of preglacial age\r\nin Europe has been fully verified by the molars from Bacton, which\r\nare now in the Manchester Museum. They are associated with _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_ and _E. antiquus_, and are incrusted with precisely the\r\nsame matrix as the teeth and bones of those species.\r\n\r\nNo caves have been discovered containing this peculiar assemblage of\r\nfossil animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pleiocene Mammalia._\r\n\r\nThe relation of the pleistocene to the pleiocene fauna is a question\r\nof very great difficulty, because the latter has not yet been\r\nsatisfactorily defined, although Prof. Gervais and Dr. Falconer have\r\ngiven the more important species from Auvergne, Montpellier, and\r\nthe Val d’Arno. The following list is taken from Prof. Gervais’s\r\ngreat work “Zoologie et Paléontologie Françaises,” p. 349, the term\r\npseudo-pleiocene merely implying that the fauna differs from that of\r\nthe marine deposit of Montpellier, which he takes as his standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pseudo-pleiocene of Issoire._\r\n\r\n    _Hystrix refossa._\r\n    _Castor issiodorensis._\r\n    _Arctomys antiqua._\r\n    _Arvicola robustus._\r\n    _Cervus pardinensis._\r\n    _C. arvernensis._\r\n    _C. causanus._\r\n    _Sus arvernensis.\r\n    Lepus Lacosti._\r\n    _Mastodon arvernensis._\r\n    _Tapirus arvernensis._\r\n    _Rhinoceros elatus?_\r\n    _Bos elatus._\r\n    _Cervus polycladus._\r\n    _C. ardens._\r\n    _C. cladocerus._\r\n    _C. issiodorensis._\r\n    _C. Perrieri._\r\n    _C. etueriarum._\r\n    _Ursus arvernensis._\r\n    _Canis borbonidus._\r\n    _Felis pardinensis._\r\n    _F. arvernensis._\r\n    _F. brevirostris._\r\n    _F. issiodorensis._\r\n    _Machairodus cultridens._\r\n    _Hyæna arvernensis._\r\n    _H. Perrieri._\r\n    _Lutra Bravardi._\r\n\r\nTo these animals Dr. Falconer[269] adds _Hippopotamus major_, _Elephas\r\nantiquus_, and _Rhinoceros megarhinus_, and he identifies _Rhinoceros\r\nelatus_ with his new species _Rhinoceros etruscus_. Prof. Gaudry agrees\r\nwith me in the belief that _Hyæna Perrieri_ is identical with _H.\r\nstriata_ or the striped species.\r\n\r\nProf. Gervais also identifies the _Equus robustus_ of M. Pomel, from\r\nthe same locality, with the common Horse, _Equus fossilis_.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of Montpellier is certainly very different from that of\r\nIssoire; but since it is neither meiocene nor pleistocene, it must\r\nbelong to one of the intermediate stages of the pleiocene. It includes\r\n\r\n    _Semnopithecus monspessulanus._\r\n    _Macacus priscus._\r\n    _Chalicomys sigmodus._\r\n    _Lagomys loxodus._\r\n    _Mastodon brevirostris._\r\n    _Rhinoceros megarhinus._\r\n    _Tapirus minor._\r\n    _Antilope Cordieri._\r\n    _A. hastata._\r\n    _Cervus Cuvieri._\r\n    _C. australis._\r\n    _Sus provincialis._\r\n    _Hyænodon insignis._\r\n    _Hyæna ----?_\r\n    _Machairodus._\r\n    _Felis Christolii._\r\n    _Lutra affinis._\r\n\r\nThe _Mastodon brevirostris_ of this list is considered by Dr. Falconer\r\nto be identical with _M. arvernensis_ of MM. Croiset and Jobert.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Val d’Arno differs from that of Montpellier and of\r\nAuvergne, and yet is considered by Dr. Falconer to be eminently typical\r\nof the European pleiocene.[270] The animals identified by him in the\r\nmuseums of Italy are as follow:--\r\n\r\n    _Felis._\r\n    _Hyæna._\r\n    _Machairodus cultridens._\r\n    _Mastodon arvernensis._\r\n    _M. Borsoni._\r\n    _Elephas antiquus._\r\n    _Elephas meridionalis._\r\n    _Rhinoceros etruscus._\r\n    _R. megarhinus._\r\n    _R. hemitœchus._\r\n    _Hippopotamus major._\r\n\r\nAll these animals, with the exception of _Rhinoceros hemitœchus_, have\r\nbeen discovered in the pseudo-pleiocene of Issoire, while the megarhine\r\nrhinoceros and _Mastodon arvernensis_ are the only two which have been\r\nobtained from the marine sands of Montpellier. The pleiocene animals,\r\ntherefore, inhabiting Northern Italy are more closely allied to those\r\nof Auvergne than to those of Montpellier.\r\n\r\nIf these three localities be taken as typical of the pleiocene strata,\r\nwe shall find that several of the species range as far north as\r\nBritain, and occur in deposits which from the evidence of the mollusca,\r\nhave been assigned to that age. _Mastodon arvernensis_, _Elephas\r\nmeridionalis_, and _Ursus arvernensis_, have been obtained from the old\r\nland-surface which underlies the sand and shingle of the Norfolk Crag,\r\nin company with many forms of deer and antelopes which have not yet\r\nbeen identified, while the _Hipparion_ is found in the marine crags of\r\nSuffolk.\r\n\r\nThe animals which especially characterize the pleiocene strata of\r\nEurope are _Machairodus cultridens_, _Mastodon arvernensis_ and _M.\r\nBorsoni_, besides the genus _Tapir_.\r\n\r\nIf this fauna be compared with that of the preglacial forest-bed,\r\nit will be seen that the difference between them is very great. The\r\npleiocene mastodon, tapir, the majority of the deer, and the antelopes\r\nare replaced by forms such as the roe and the red-deer, unknown up to\r\nthat time. Nevertheless many of the pleiocene animals were able to hold\r\ntheir ground against the pleistocene invaders, although, subsequently,\r\nas I have already shown, they disappeared one by one, being ultimately\r\nbeaten in the struggle for life by the new comers. The progress of\r\nthis struggle has been used in the preceding pages as a means of\r\nclassification. This fauna has not been discovered in any cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of Characteristic Pleistocene and Pleiocene Species._\r\n\r\nThe following are the salient points of the pleistocene age offered\r\nby the study of the land mammalia in the area north of the Alps and\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEISTOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nA.--_The latest stage._\r\n\r\n    Palæolithic Man.\r\n    Woolly Rhinoceros, abundant.\r\n    Mammoth, abundant.\r\n    Reindeer, abundant.\r\n    Stag, comparatively rare.\r\n    Northern forms of life in full possession of area north of Alps\r\n        and Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nB.--_The middle stage._\r\n\r\n    Palæolithic Man.\r\n    _Machairodus latidens._\r\n    Stag, abundant.\r\n    Northern forms of life present, but not in force.\r\n    _Rhinoceros megarhinus_, still living.\r\n    Woolly Rhinoceros, present.\r\n\r\nC.--_The early stage._\r\n\r\nThe following are animals peculiar to this stage:--\r\n\r\n    _Trogontherium Cuvieri._\r\n    _Cerus verticornis._\r\n    _Cervus Sedgwickii._\r\n    _C. carnutorum._\r\n\r\nThe following make their appearance:--The beaver, musk-shrew,\r\ncave-bear, roe, stag, Irish elk, urus, and bison, wild-boar, horse,\r\n(2), mammoth, wolf, and fox.\r\n\r\nThe pleiocene _Ursus arvernensis_, _Cervus Polignacus_, _Rhinoceros\r\netruscus_, and _Elephas meridionalis_ still living.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEIOCENE.\r\n\r\n    _Mastodon arvernensis._\r\n    _M. Borsoni._\r\n    _Hipparion gracile._\r\n    No living species of European Deer.\r\n\r\nThe three subdivisions of the pleistocene do not apply to the region\r\nsouth of the Alps and Pyrenees, because the northern group of animals\r\ndid not pass into Spain and Italy. In these two countries we find\r\nsouthern and pleiocene animals living throughout the pleistocene age,\r\nwhich in France and Britain lived only in the two earlier stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of Man in Europe._\r\n\r\nNo remains have been discovered up to the present time in any part of\r\nEurope which can be referred with certainty to a higher antiquity than\r\nthe pleistocene age. The palæolithic people or peoples arrived in\r\nEurope along with the peculiar fauna of that age, and after dwelling\r\nhere for a length of time, which is to be measured by the vast physical\r\nand climatal changes, described in the last three chapters, finally\r\ndisappeared, leaving behind as their representatives the Eskimos\r\ntribes of arctic America. There is no evidence that they were inferior\r\nin intellectual capacity to many of the lower races of the present\r\ntime, or more closely linked to the lower animals. The traces which\r\nthey have left behind tell us nothing as to the truth or falsehood of\r\nthe doctrine of evolution, for if it be maintained on the one hand,\r\nthat the first appearance of man as a man, and not as a man-like\r\nbrute, is inconsistent with that doctrine, it may be answered that\r\nthe lapse of time between his appearance in the pleistocene age and\r\nthe present day, is too small to have produced appreciable physical\r\nor intellectual change. Also, it must not be forgotten, that we have\r\nmerely investigated the antiquity of the sojourn of man in Europe, and\r\nnot the general question of his first appearance on the earth, with\r\nwhich it is very generally confounded. Dr. Falconer well remarked that\r\nthe _origines_ of mankind are to be sought, not in Europe, but in the\r\ntropical regions, probably of Asia. To these we have no clue in the\r\npresent stage of the inquiry. The higher apes are represented in the\r\nEuropean meiocene and pleiocene strata, by extinct forms uniting in\r\nsome cases the characters of different living species, but they do\r\nnot show any tendency to assume human characters. It must indeed be\r\nallowed, that the study of fossil remains throws as little light as the\r\ndocuments of history on the relation of man to the lower animals. The\r\nhistorian commences his labours with the high civilization of Assyria\r\nand Egypt, and can merely guess at the steps by which it was achieved;\r\nthe palæontologist meets with the traces of man in the pleistocene\r\nstrata, and he too can merely guess at the antecedent steps by which\r\nman arrived even at that culture which is implied by the implements.\r\nThe latter has proved that the antiquity of man is greater than the\r\nformer had supposed. Neither has contributed anything towards the\r\nsolution of the problem of his origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man lived in India in Pleistocene Age._\r\n\r\nThe researches of the Geological Surveyors has shown that in ancient\r\ntimes man, in the same stage of civilization as the palæolithic man of\r\nEurope, lived in Southern India and in the valley of the Narbadá. In\r\n1868[271] Mr. Bruce Foote described the flint implements which were\r\ndiscovered over a large area in the districts of Madras, either in the\r\nred clayey deposit known as Laterite, or in such positions as implied\r\nthat they had been washed out of it. They all belong to the same rude\r\ntypes as those of the pleistocene strata of North-western Europe. A\r\nsmall fragment of bone was the only fossil which had up to that time\r\nbeen discovered in the Laterite, and this I was able to identify\r\nin 1869 as a portion of a human tibia of the abnormal platycnemic\r\nvariety, which has been described in the fifth chapter of this work,\r\nfrom the European caves and tombs. The Lateritic deposits themselves\r\nare strictly analogous to our river-strata and brick-earths in their\r\nconstitution, and in their resting at various levels above the sea,\r\nand were, as Mr. Foote remarks, formed under conditions different to\r\nthose which are now going on in that district. They prove that the\r\nperiod of the sojourn of palæolithic man in Southern India is divided\r\nfrom the present day by considerable geographical changes, such as the\r\nelevation of land, and the erosion and breaking up of accumulations\r\nwhich were once continuous. We have seen that somewhat similar\r\nchanges have happened in Europe, in the interval which separates the\r\npalæolithic period from our own time.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of a rudely chipped implement of quartzite, of the\r\npointed oval shape common in the gravels of Britain and France,\r\npublished by Mr. Medlicott in 1873, in the “Records of the Geological\r\nSurvey of India,” proves further that man was a member of the\r\nremarkable fauna which inhabited the valley of the Narbadá in ancient\r\ntimes. It was dug out of reddish unstratified clay by Mr. Hacket at a\r\ndepth of three feet from the upper surface, which was covered by twenty\r\nfeet of ossiferous gravel, on the left bank of the Narbadá near the\r\nvalley of Bhutra. The clay belongs to the same fluviatile series as\r\nthat from which the mammalia were obtained and named by Dr. Falconer in\r\n1828. Both clay and gravel are shown to be of fluviatile origin, by the\r\npresence of fresh-water mussels of the varieties still living in the\r\nadjacent river.\r\n\r\nThe fossil bones belong to extinct and living animals. Among the\r\nformer are two kinds of elephant (_E. namadicus_) and (_E. stegodon\r\ninsignis_), one of which is closely allied to the European _E.\r\nantiquus_, two species of hippopotamus, one (_H. palæindicus_) with\r\nfour incisors in front of the jaws like the African, and a second with\r\nsix incisors belonging to the extinct division of hexaprotodon, a\r\nlarge ox (_Bos namadicus_), a deer and a bear. The living forms are\r\nrepresented by the buffalo (_Bubalus namadicus_), which is identical\r\nwith the wild arnee from which the Indian domestic buffaloes have\r\ndescended, and the gavial, or long-snouted Gangetic crocodile. This\r\nimperfect list, borrowed from Dr. Falconer,[272] shows that there is\r\nthe same mixture of extinct with living forms in the valley of the\r\nGanges, while the clays and gravels were being accumulated, as we\r\nhave observed in the pleistocene deposits of Europe, and the fauna\r\nmay therefore be referred to the pleistocene age, and probably, as\r\nMr. Medlicott proposes, to the late division of that age. The exact\r\ncorrespondence of the quartzite implements with those which are so\r\nabundant in the European river-strata of the same age, adds additional\r\nweight to this conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Are the Palæolithic Aborigines of India related to those of Europe?_\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that Dr. Falconer, writing in 1865 of the\r\npeculiar fauna of the Narbadá, should have held the view that man was\r\nliving in India at that time, and that the memory of the hippopotamus\r\nwas handed down in Aryan traditions, under the striking name of the\r\nwater elephant. “After reflecting,” he writes, “on the question during\r\nmany years in its palæontological and ethnological bearings, my leaning\r\nis to the view that _Hippopotamus namadicus_ was extinct in India long\r\nbefore the Aryan invasion, but that it was familiar to the earlier\r\nindigenous races.” (ii. p. 644.) This inference is proved to be\r\nliterally true by the discovery of the palæolithic implements in the\r\nossiferous strata of the Narbadá, which must have required long ages\r\nfor their accumulation and subsequent erosion.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude that palæolithic man inhabited both Europe\r\nand India in the pleistocene age. And possibly the identity of the\r\nimplements, in these two remote regions, may be accounted for in the\r\nsame manner as the identity of Aryan root-words, by the view that their\r\nfabricators may have come from the same centre of dispersal, by the\r\nsame routes as those which were subsequently used by the pre-Aryan, and\r\nAryan, invaders of Europe and India. But whether this be accepted or\r\nnot, it cannot be denied that the man who inhabited both these regions\r\nwas in the same rude stage of human progress, and played his part in\r\nthe same life-era.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Palæolithic Man lived in Palestine._\r\n\r\nThe discovery, by the Abbé Richard,[273] of a palæolithic flint\r\nimplement, of the ordinary river-bed type, on the surface of a stratum\r\nof gravel between Mount Tabor and the lake of Tiberias, lends great\r\nweight to the view that the Aborigines of India and Europe, whose\r\nimplements are found in the deposits of rivers, migrated from the same\r\ncentre, since it bridges over the great interval of space by which\r\nthey were isolated. It is very probable, that future discoveries may\r\nreveal the presence of a tolerably uniform priscan population, in the\r\npleistocene age, throughout this vast area: which as yet has only been\r\nexplored by archæologists in a few isolated points, with the important\r\nresults recorded in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt now remains for us to sum up the results of the exploration of\r\nEuropean caves, of which an imperfect outline has been given in this\r\nwork. Their formation, and filling up, have an important bearing on the\r\nphysical geography of the districts in which they occur, and reveal\r\nthe great changes which are going on, in the calcareous rocks, at the\r\npresent time. The study of the remains which they contain has led to\r\nthe recognition of the fact, that the climate and geography of Europe,\r\nin ancient times, were altogether different from those of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt has also made large additions to the history of the sojourn of man\r\nin Europe. We find a hunting and fishing race of cave-dwellers, in the\r\nremote pleistocene age, in possession of France, Belgium, Germany, and\r\nBritain, probably of the same stock as the Eskimos, living and forming\r\npart of a fauna, in which northern and southern, living and extinct,\r\nspecies are strangely mingled with those now living in Europe. In the\r\nneolithic age caves were inhabited, and used for tombs, by men of\r\nthe Iberian or Basque race, which is still represented by the small,\r\ndark-haired, peoples of western Europe. They were rarely used in the\r\nbronze age. When we arrive within the borders of history in Britain,\r\nwe find them offering shelter to the Brit-Welsh flying from their\r\nenemies after the ruin of the Roman empire, and throwing great light\r\non the fragmentary records of those obscure times. In treating of these\r\nquestions, it has been necessary to discuss problems of deep and varied\r\ninterest to the ethnologist, physicist, and historian, some of which\r\nhave been partially solved, while others await the light of the higher\r\nknowledge which will be the fruit of a wider experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.--P. 30.\r\n\r\nON THE INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS OF CAVE-HUNTING.\r\n\r\n  Instruments used in Cave-hunting.--The Search after Bone-caves.--\r\n    The three modes of Cave-digging.--Stalagmitic Floors to be broken\r\n    up.--Preservation of Fossil Bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instruments used in Cave-hunting._\r\n\r\nThe instruments which Mr. James Parker, Mr. Ayshford Sanford and myself\r\nhave found most valuable in cave-hunting, apart from the tools of the\r\nworkman, are as follow:--\r\n\r\n1. A hammer with an ash handle about twenty inches long, inserted into\r\na square head of best steel, ending in a chisel edge in the same plane\r\nas the handle, weighing almost eight ounces, and seven inches in length.\r\n\r\n2. A steel chisel ten inches long.\r\n\r\n3. A prismatic compass.\r\n\r\n4. A thermometer for taking the temperatures of the air and water.\r\n\r\n5. An aneroid.\r\n\r\n6. A steel measuring tape.\r\n\r\n7. Abney’s patent level which is used for laying down datum-line for\r\nplan, as well as for taking the dips and angles.\r\n\r\nIn making a plan we have found it useful to mark the datum-line by\r\na stout string or wire and to measure from it as the work proceeds,\r\nindicating on the sides and floor of the cave the points of\r\nmeasurement, with paint or wooden pegs.\r\n\r\n8. A stout rope not less than twenty feet long with a horse’s girth at\r\nthe end is necessary for the exploration of vertical fissures, so that\r\nthe explorer may be let down without any great danger. No large unknown\r\ncaves should be explored without a rope, or by a party less than three\r\nin number. In exploring the caves of Burrington Combe we used a rope\r\nsixty feet long. The descent into Helln Pot, described in the second\r\nchapter, p. 41, was effected in the following manner. A strong platform\r\nof timber was made over the open fissure, and from it a square “cage”\r\nor “basket” of the ordinary kind used in mining was let down for the\r\nfirst drop of 198 feet. It was prevented from twisting round by two\r\nguide ropes. For the rest of the falls we had two ladders eight feet\r\nlong, and a rope, without which we should have been unable to reach the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    |     |      a       |     |\r\n  --+-----+--------------+-----+--\r\n  g | ... |              | ... | g\r\n    |     |              |     |\r\n  b |  e  | c    d     c |  e  | b\r\n    |     |              |     |\r\n  g | ... |              | ... | g\r\n  --+-----+--------------+-----+--\r\n    |     |      a       |     |\r\n]\r\n\r\n9. In the exploration of water-caves, in which there are sometimes\r\nsheets of water of considerable size and depth, a raft may be used,\r\nsuch as that devised by Mr. James Parker for the navigation of the\r\ngreat cave of Wookey Hole. It consisted of a platform supported on\r\nbarrels and built as follows: A frame of stout poles was made; two,\r\n_a a_, being eight feet long, with four others, _b_, _c_, lashed\r\nfirmly across, each four feet in length. The space _d_ was converted\r\ninto a platform by nailing boards across, and this was buoyed up by\r\na beer-barrel at each end in the interspace _e_. The barrels were\r\nattached to the raft by two loops of rope _g_, passing over from _b_\r\nto _c_, and thus kept in place, although they freely twisted and\r\nturned in actual use. The ropes had an advantage over iron hoops for\r\nthe attachment of the barrels, because when they were tightened the\r\nplatform was raised above the water, when they were loosened it was\r\nlowered, and thus the raft could be adjusted to the weight to be\r\ncarried, to the depth of the water, and the distance of the water-line\r\nfrom the roof. A raft of this kind will bear three persons, and is\r\nsufficiently light to be carried over the shallows. With it Mr. Parker\r\nmade his way for a considerable distance in the Wookey Hole cavern,\r\nand subsequently I penetrated as far as the water-line would allow me\r\nto get. A long pole is also necessary for punting. Mr. Parker found\r\nby experience that a raft made of boards nailed on the top of two\r\nbeer-barrels was too unstable to be of any use. In making his way\r\nacross subterranean pools the cave-hunter ought to be prepared for\r\naccidents, for the depth is very uncertain, and the water sufficiently\r\ncold to cause cramp. For the exploration of ordinary water-caves a\r\nraft is unnecessary, but no attempt should be made without a rope. In\r\nYorkshire and Derbyshire there is an unlimited field for adventure in\r\nthe subterranean water-courses.\r\n\r\n10. The most convenient lights for use in caves are the common\r\ncomposite candles. Paraffin candles are open to the objection that they\r\ngutter, lanthorns do not give a sufficiently diffused light, and the\r\nsmoke of paraffin torches, or flambeaux dipped in turpentine or tar is\r\nintolerable. Magnesium wire reveals the beauties of the higher roofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Search after Ossiferous Caves._\r\n\r\nMany of the ossiferous caves, and especially those of the neolithic\r\nand pleistocene ages, have their entrances masked by débris which has\r\nbeen accumulated from the surface above during the long lapse of ages.\r\nIn their discovery I have found rabbits, foxes, and badgers of the\r\ngreatest service, since these animals generally make their burrows\r\nin such places. And where their earths are met with at the base of a\r\nvertical wall of rock, I have very generally found a cave. They were\r\nmy sole guides to the discovery of the five sepulchral caves at Perthi\r\nChwareu, described in the fifth chapter, in a district in which up to\r\nthat time caves were not known to exist.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in caves very generally chose for their habitations the\r\nsunny side of the ravines and valleys, and the spots which commanded a\r\nwide view, and, therefore, their remains are to be looked for in those\r\nplaces, rather than on the cold and sunless sides, or where an enemy\r\nmight approach without observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scientific Methods of Cave-digging._\r\n\r\nThe exploration of an ossiferous cavern with sufficient accuracy to be\r\nof scientific value, may be carried out in all tunnel caves, or those\r\nextending horizontally into the rock, by one of the three following\r\nmethods which may be adapted to the local conditions:--\r\n\r\nThe first step to take in all cases is to make a plan of the entrance,\r\nand to cut a passage down to the rock at the entrance, so as to\r\nobtain a clear idea of the sequence of the strata. In the hyæna-den\r\nat Wookey Hole, we first of all cut a passage through the cave-earth\r\nwhich extended from the roof to the floor, and then removed the earth\r\non either side in blocks, until ultimately the chamber and passages\r\ndescribed in the eighth chapter were cleared of their contents. Our\r\nwork was measured every evening, and each bone and object found was\r\nlabelled with the date which was recorded on the ground plan. Vertical\r\nsections were also taken from time to time. This mode, supplemented\r\nby constant supervision of the workmen, was sufficiently accurate to\r\nsatisfy the demands of scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria Cave, where the demarcation between the strata was very\r\ndistinct, was explored, while the work was under my direction up\r\nto September 1873, in a somewhat similar fashion. It was, however,\r\nimpossible on account of the great depth of the deposits to cut a\r\npassage down to the rock at the entrance. We therefore examined the\r\nsuperficial strata throughout the cave, merely gauging the thickness of\r\nthose below by sinking three shafts. Where a cave is sufficiently high\r\nto allow of the work being carried on, it is better to clear out one\r\nstratum before another is disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate and perfect method of cave exploration is that\r\nwhich has been used by the committee in Kent’s Hole, under the\r\nsuperintendence of Mr. Pengelly, who writes as follows:[274]--\r\n\r\n“The following is the method of exploration which has been observed\r\nfrom the commencement, and which it is believed affords a simple and\r\ncorrect method of determining the exact position of every object which\r\nhas been found.\r\n\r\n“1. The black soil accessible between the masses of limestone on the\r\nsurface was carefully examined and removed.\r\n\r\n“2. The limestone blocks occupying the surface of the deposits were\r\nblasted and otherwise broken up, and taken out of the cavern.\r\n\r\n“3. A line termed the ‘datum-line,’ is stretched horizontally from a\r\nfixed point at the entrance to another at the back of the chamber.\r\n\r\n“4. Lines, one foot apart, are drawn at right angles to the datum-line,\r\nand therefore parallel to one another, across the chamber so as to\r\ndivide the surface of the deposit into belts termed ‘parallels.’\r\n\r\n“5. In each parallel the black mould which the limestone masses had\r\ncovered is first examined and removed, and then the stalagmite breccia,\r\nso as to lay bare the surface of the cave-earth.\r\n\r\n“6. Horizontal lines, a foot apart, are then drawn from side to side\r\nacross the vertical face of the section so as to divide the parallel\r\ninto four layers or ‘levels,’ each a foot deep.\r\n\r\n“Finally each level is divided into lengths called ‘yards,’ each three\r\nfeet long, and measured right and left from the datum-line as an axis\r\nof abscissæ.\r\n\r\n“In fine, the cave-earth is excavated in vertical slices or parallels\r\nfour feet high, one foot thick, and as long as the chamber is broad,\r\nwhere this breadth does not exceed thirty feet. Each parallel is taken\r\nout in levels one foot high, and in each level in horizontal prisms\r\nthree feet long and a foot square in the section, so that each contains\r\nthree cubic feet of material.\r\n\r\n“This material, after being carefully examined _in situ_ by\r\ncandlelight, is taken to the door and re-examined by daylight, after\r\nwhich it is at once removed without the cavern. A box is appropriated\r\nto each yard exclusively, and in it are placed all the objects of\r\ninterest which the prism yields. The boxes, each having a label\r\ncontaining the data necessary for defining the situation of its\r\ncontents, are daily sent to the honorary secretary of the committee,\r\nby whom the specimens are at once cleaned and packed in fresh boxes.\r\nThe labels are numbered and packed with the specimens to which they\r\nrespectively belong, and a record of the day’s work is entered in a\r\ndiary.\r\n\r\n“The same method is followed in the examination of the black mould,\r\nand also of the stalagmitic breccia, with the single exception that in\r\nthese cases the parallels are not divided into levels and yards.”\r\n\r\nA careful record of the work, and minute sections should be taken daily\r\non the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Stalagmitic Floor to be broken up._\r\n\r\nIn all cases the crystalline flooring of stalagmite and stalagmitic\r\nbreccias which often occur, should be broken up, or, if necessary,\r\nblasted with gunpowder. The former very frequently conceals the\r\npleistocene remains, and the latter, which is in Kent’s Hole many feet\r\nthick, often contains the traces of man and wild animals. Sometimes it\r\nis very difficult to distinguish the breccia from the rocky floor.\r\n\r\nWhere the ossiferous deposit fills a vertical fissure it must be worked\r\non the same plan as in ochre-mining, by sinking a shaft. To dig into it\r\nfrom below (where this is possible) is very dangerous, because of the\r\nlarge imbedded stones which fall sometimes without any warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Preservation of Fossil Remains._\r\n\r\nThe fossil bones and teeth, which have very generally lost their\r\ngelatine and have a tendency to crumble and split to pieces in drying,\r\nshould be gradually dried, and from time to time saturated with a weak\r\nhot solution of gelatine or glue. Silicate of soda, sometimes called\r\n“liquid glass,” or melted paraffin (not the oil), may also be used for\r\nthe same purpose. If the bones are extremely soft, they may be rescued\r\nfrom destruction by letting them dry in the matrix, saturating them\r\nand the matrix with a solution of gelatine, and then clearing off the\r\nlatter. In this manner I preserved the skull of the musk sheep which is\r\nnow in the Museum of the Geological Survey in Jermyn Street, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.--P. 40.\r\n\r\n  _Observations on the Rate at which Stalagmite is being accumulated in\r\n    the Ingleborough Cave._ Proceed. Lit. and Phil. Soc. Manch. April\r\n    1873.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only attempt to measure with accuracy the rate of the accumulation\r\nof stalagmite in caverns, in this country, is that made by Mr. James\r\nFarrer in the Ingleborough Cave, in the years 1839 and 1845, and\r\npublished by Prof. Phillips in the “Rivers, Mountains, and Sea Coast of\r\nYorkshire” (second edition, 1855, pp. 34-35). The stalagmite of which\r\nthe measurements were taken is that termed, from its shape, the Jockey\r\nCap. It rises from a crystalline pavement to a height of about two\r\nand a half feet, and is the result of a deposit of carbonate of lime,\r\nbrought down by a line of drops that fall into a basin at its top, and\r\nflow over the general surface. On March 13th, 1873, in company with\r\nMr. John Birkbeck and Mr. Walker, I was enabled by the kindness of Mr.\r\nFarrer to take a set of measurements, to be recorded for use in after\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of insuring accuracy in future observations, three holes\r\nwere bored at the base of the stalagmite, and three gauges of brass\r\nwire, gilt, inserted; gauge No. 1 in the following table being that on\r\nthe S.S.E., No. 2 on N.N.E., No. 3 on the West side. The curvilinear\r\ndimensions were taken with fine iron wire, or with a steel measure;\r\nand the circumferential around the base along a line marked by the\r\nthree gauges. The measurements 2, 3, and 4 of the table were taken on\r\nthe 15th of March, by Mr. Walker, and their accuracy may be tested by\r\nthe fact that they coincide exactly with No. 1, which I took two days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe lengths of wire, properly labelled, are deposited in the Manchester\r\nMuseum, the Owens College, for future observers.\r\n\r\nIn the following table I have given my own measurements and compared\r\nthem with those taken by Mr. Farrer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF MEASUREMENTS.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+--------+\r\n  |                                | 13th  |       |       |           |Rate of |\r\n  |                                | Mar.  |       |30 Oct.| Increase  |Increase|\r\n  |                                | 1873. | 1839. | 1845. |   since   |  per   |\r\n  |                                |Inches.|Inches.|Inches.|1839.|1845.| annum. |\r\n  |                                |       |       |       |     |     | Inches |\r\n  +--------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+--------+\r\n  | 1 Basal circumference at       |       |       |       |     |     |·2941-  |\r\n  |     Gauges                     |128    |118    |120    | 10  |  8  |  ·2857 |\r\n  | 2 Gauge No. 1 to Gauge No. 2   | 52·625|       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 3   ”       2      ”       3   | 35·0  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 4   ”       3      ”       1   | 40·375|       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 5 Gauge No. 1 to hole in centre|       |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |                of basin at apex| 30    |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 6   ”       2     ”       ”    | 29·5  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 7   ”       3     ”       ”    | 31·4  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 8 Height from Gauge No. 1      | 20·9  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  | 9   ”         ”         2 min  | 20·4  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |10 Maximum                      | 29·7  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |11 Tape measurement on slope    |       |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |     Gauge No. 1 to edge of apex| 26·7  |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |12  ”      No. 2     ”       ”  | 26·6  |21·0   |       | 5·6 |     |        |\r\n  |13  ”       ”   maximum      ”  | 36·0  |32·0   | 35·0  | 4·0 | 1·0 |        |\r\n  |14 Roof to apex of Jockey Cap   | 87    |       | 95·25 |     | 8·25|·2946   |\r\n  |15 Roof to tip of stalactite    |       |       | 10    |     |     |        |\r\n  |16 Stalactite to apex of Jockey |       |       |       |     |     |        |\r\n  |     Cap                        |       |       | 85·25 |     |     |        |\r\n  +--------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-----+--------+\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have been unable to identify the exact spots where the\r\nstalagmite was measured by Mr. Farrer, so that the only measurement\r\nwhich affords any trustworthy data for estimating the rate of increase\r\nis number 14. With regard to this, the only possible ground of error\r\nis the erosion of the general surface of the solid limestone, of which\r\nthe roof is composed, by carbonic acid, since the year 1845, and this\r\nis so small as to be practically inappreciable. We have, therefore,\r\nevidence that the Jockey’s Cap is growing at the rate of ·2946 of an\r\ninch per annum, and that if the present rate of growth be continued\r\nit will finally arrive at the roof in about 295 years. But even this\r\ncomparatively short lapse of time will probably be diminished by the\r\ngrowth of a pendent stalactite above, that is now being formed in\r\nplace of that which measured ten inches in 1845, and has since been\r\naccidentally destroyed. It is very possible that the Jockey Cap may\r\nbe the result not of the continuous but of the intermittent drip of\r\nwater containing a variable quantity of carbonate of lime, and that,\r\ntherefore, the present rate of growth is not a measure of its past\r\nor future condition. Its possible age in 1845 was estimated by Prof.\r\nPhillips at 259 years, on the supposition that the grain of carbonate\r\nof lime in each pint was deposited. If, however, it grew at its present\r\nrate it may be not more than 100 years old. All the stalagmites and\r\nstalactites in the Ingleborough Cave may not date further back than the\r\ntime of Edward III. if the Jockey Cap be taken as a measure of the rate\r\nof deposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abbeville, flint implements of, 16.\r\n\r\n  Aborigines (palæolithic) of India, 428, 429.\r\n\r\n  Acid-worn joint, Doveholes, Derbyshire, 52.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Dr. Leith, explores bone-caves of Malta, 377;\r\n    finds tooth of pigmy hippopotamus in Candia, 378.\r\n\r\n  Adriatic Sea, the, 388.\r\n\r\n  Africa, mainland of, 379;\r\n    moraines in, 387;\r\n    physical geography of, in pleistocene age, 370;\r\n    species of European mammalia found in, 380.\r\n\r\n  African animals in the Iberian peninsula, 372;\r\n    elephant, the, 372, 376.\r\n\r\n  Age of cavern deposits, test of, 410.\r\n\r\n  Albert Cave, the, Settle, 101.\r\n\r\n  Alessi, Canon, cited, 376.\r\n\r\n  Algeria, fossil mammalia in, 379.\r\n\r\n  Alps, the, animals living to the North of, 359, 360;\r\n    glaciers of, 403.\r\n\r\n  Altai mountains, the, Irish elk in, 401;\r\n    panther in, 403.\r\n\r\n  America, animals in, 396-399.\r\n\r\n  Amiens, flint implements in the gravels of, 16.\r\n\r\n  Anatolia, the glaciers of, 383-385.\r\n\r\n  Anca, Baron, on caves of northern Sicily, 376.\r\n\r\n  Andalusia, prehistoric antiquities in, 209.\r\n\r\n  Animals in Brit-Welsh caves, 130, 131;\r\n    classificatory value of, 78;\r\n    domestic, derived from Asia, 137;\r\n    evidence of, as to climate, 392;\r\n    extinct species of, 400;\r\n    historic, 75, 76;\r\n    living under the care of man, 77;\r\n    migration of, 366;\r\n    northern group of, 395;\r\n    pleistocene, living to the north of the Alps, 359-361;\r\n    unknown in Britain in the prehistoric age, 266;\r\n    prehistoric, 265;\r\n    probable cause of association of species, 397;\r\n    southern group of, 393;\r\n    temperate group of, 399.\r\n\r\n  _Antelope saiga_, the, 336, 348, 399.\r\n\r\n  Antelopes, spread of, into Europe, 370.\r\n\r\n  Antiquity of Man in Europe, 424.\r\n\r\n  Aquitaine, implements in the caves of, 354, 355;\r\n    palæolithic hunters in, 347;\r\n    the people of, 356, 357.\r\n\r\n  Ardennes, rock denuded from the, 61.\r\n\r\n  Arenaceous rocks, caves in, 24.\r\n\r\n  Arnould, M., on the cave of Sclaigneaux, 218.\r\n\r\n  Arrows used by palæolithic hunters, 342.\r\n\r\n  Art of the Eskimos, 356.\r\n\r\n  Arthur’s cave, King, 290.\r\n\r\n  Ashmolean Museum, harpoons in the, 354, 356.\r\n\r\n  Asia, domestic animals of Europe derived from, 137;\r\n    the lion in, 393.\r\n\r\n  Ass, the, 77.\r\n\r\n  Atlantic Ocean, the, 380;\r\n    shore, the, at one hundred fathom line, 365.\r\n\r\n  Atlas mountains, glaciers of the, 386.\r\n\r\n  Aurignac, the cave of, 19;\r\n    bones found in, 246;\r\n    discovery of, 243;\r\n    interment in, 242;\r\n    skeletons of man above palæolithic stratum of, 245.\r\n\r\n  Austen, Mr. Godwin- (_see_ Godwin-Austen).\r\n\r\n  Auvergne, palæolithic men in, 21.\r\n\r\n  Avison, cave of, 18.\r\n\r\n  Axe, the river, 29.\r\n\r\n  Aymard, M., cited, 330.\r\n\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  Badger, the (_see_ _Meles taxus_).\r\n\r\n  Banwell, cave at, 293.\r\n\r\n  Basques, the, eastern derivation of, 227, 228;\r\n    elements of, in British and French populations, 225;\r\n    in Britain and Ireland in the neolithic age, 215;\r\n    the Dolicho-cephali cognate with, 213;\r\n    the oldest neolithic population, 223.\r\n\r\n  Baumann’s Hole, 12.\r\n\r\n  Baume, the cave of, animals found in, 337.\r\n\r\n  Bayle, M., on animals from Mansourah, 379.\r\n\r\n  Bear, the, 75, 79, 131, 146;\r\n    in Germany, 278;\r\n    in the care of Kühloch, 27;\r\n    the cave, 138, 278, 401;\r\n    the grizzly, 278, 348, 376, 399.\r\n\r\n  Beard, Mr., of Banwell, cited, 15, 33;\r\n    explorations of, 292.\r\n\r\n  Beaumont, Mr. John, describes Wookey Hole, 29;\r\n    on fungoid structures, 69.\r\n\r\n  Beaver, the, 76, 79, 132.\r\n\r\n  Behrens, Dr., cited, 12.\r\n\r\n  Belgium, brachy-cephalic skulls found in, 228;\r\n    caves in, 20, 347;\r\n    dolicho-cephalic skulls in, 215.\r\n\r\n  Bell, Professor, on the ass, 77.\r\n\r\n  Bertrand, M.

There are many other instances of\r\nthe like use of a Celtic name by the English conquerors of the Celts.\r\nIn the Limestone plateau of Llanamynech, near Oswestry, there is a cave\r\ncalled “The Ogo.”\r\n\r\n[26] Phil. Trans. 1680, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[27] The cave is accessible, and can be examined without any climbing.\r\n\r\n[28] Both of these caves are kept in excellent order, and the latter is\r\nlighted with gas.\r\n\r\n[29] The cave is admirably preserved by the care of the owner, J.\r\nFarrer, Esq., and may be visited without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n[30] Rivers, Mountains, and Sea-coast of Yorkshire, 8vo. 1854, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[31] On the Ordnance Maps it is wrongly printed Alum Pot.\r\n\r\n[32] Op. cit.

Concretionary action, with which it is\r\ngenerally confused, ought to be defined as the deposition of successive\r\nlayers of matter round a nucleus or centre. The one action operates\r\nfrom the circumference to the centre, the other from the centre to the\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n[36] Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, p. 361.\r\n\r\n[37] Prestwich, Ann.

The laminated clay is not yet proved to occupy such a large\r\narea in the cave, or to be so regularly deposited, or so clearly\r\ndefined. It occurs at _various_ levels in the mass of the grey clay\r\nin the section (to be seen on May 21, 1873), above and below the\r\ncave-earth.--“The Older Deposits in the Victoria Cave,” Geol.

The body was not laid out after death, but\r\nmay have been folded together, as in the case of the ancient Peruvian\r\nmummies. No regularity, however, in the contracted posture could be\r\nobserved in the many tumuli and caves which I have explored, although\r\nvery generally the corpse had been interred on its side.\r\n\r\n[98] Edinburgh New Phil.

I have made the comparison in a rough\r\nway in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nIf the numbers representing the _length_, _breadth_, and _height_\r\nof the skull are added together, a number is obtained which will,\r\nof course, in some measure, indicate the gross dimensions of the\r\nskull. From the rather numerous data furnished by my own Tables of\r\nMeasurements I obtained the results stated in the subjoined list,\r\nin which the gross mean dimensions of various sets of crania are\r\ncontrasted.\r\n\r\n     1.

M. Broca takes a\r\ndifferent point of view to that advanced in these pages, holding that\r\nthe Celts were dark and the Belgic were blue-eyed tall Kymri or Cimbri.\r\nThe Celts known to history were undoubtedly a tall fair race.\r\n\r\n[151] In treating this difficult subject, I have purposely omitted to\r\nuse the uncertain light of philology. We may expect to derive as much\r\nknowledge as to the relations between Tyrrhenian, Ligurian, Basque, and\r\nother obscure non-Aryan peoples from the study of languages, as we have\r\nalready obtained of the Aryans by the same means. It is very probable\r\nthat, like the Sanscrit, the Basque roots will be found widely spread\r\nboth in Asia, Asia Minor, Europe, and N. Africa.\r\n\r\n[152] “Anthrop. Mem.” Vols. i. and iii.

In our\r\nlodging at Wells there was a beautiful Scotch deerhound, named “Luna,”\r\nwhose master was away at the time. Luna persisted in being with us\r\nday and night. In the morning she walked with us to the cave, and\r\nlay watching at the entrance till we came out, for she was afraid to\r\nventure into the darkness. In the evening she returned home with us.\r\nShe continued to do this the whole time of that year’s excavations. It\r\nwas only natural to suppose that when we left she would, like other\r\ndogs, pick up new friends. But she did nothing of the kind. When we\r\ninquired the next year upon our return, we were told that poor Luna\r\nrefused food the day we left, and gradually pined away and died.\r\n\r\n[197] Possibly it may have belonged to _Elephas_, but its more compact\r\ntexture seems to me to indicate rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n[198] Bone needles were found in Kent’s Hole and in many foreign caves\r\nof this age.\r\n\r\n[199] These woodblocks were used in my essay on Hyænas in the “Natural\r\nHistory Review,” and have been lent by the kindness of Messrs.

Soc.\r\n\r\n[262] Mr. James Geikie’s view (“The Great Ice-Age,” 8vo. 1874) that the\r\nmixture of the northern and southern forms is due to the destruction of\r\nossiferous strata by streams, which subsequently deposited remains of\r\nwidely different ages together, is rendered untenable by the fact that\r\nthey are generally preserved in the same mineral state. It would have\r\nbeen impossible for this to have taken place without leaving decided\r\ntraces behind in the rolled and water-worn condition of the older\r\nseries, such as may be seen in the case of the eocene and meiocene\r\nfossils in the Red Crag of Suffolk.\r\n\r\n[263] “Quart.

The\r\nadditions have not been added. The errors listed for pages 196 and 201\r\nwere not found in the text, and both the opening and closing inverted\r\ncommas (quotation marks) have been removed on page 386.\r\n\r\nUnlike the printed book, all illustrations in this eBook appear between\r\nparagraphs, so the page references in the List of Illustrations do not\r\nnecessarily match their actual positions. However, links, in versions\r\nof this eBook that support them, do lead directly to the corresponding\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nThe Index was not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page\r\nreferences.\r\n\r\nText has many references to “Lartet” and just a few to “Lortet”. They\r\nseem to refer to the same person, but both are listed in the Index, so\r\nboth spellings have been retained.\r\n\r\nText refers to “Rev. J. MacEnery”, “Rev. J. McEnery” and “McEnery”.\r\nThese all refer to the same person, but the correct spelling is\r\nuncertain, so both variations have been retained.\r\n\r\nSome of the fractional numbers (e.g., 1/1, 1/2) in illustration\r\ncaptions were unclear and may have been incorrectly transcribed.\r\n\r\nMost tables wider than 75 characters have been made narrower, either\r\nby using Keys to their column headings or, in the table on page 172,\r\nby segmenting it and repeating the first column in each segment. A\r\nfew tables remain wider than 75 characters as they otherwise became\r\nunreadable.\r\n\r\nPage 2: “dwellings of evil spirits” was misprinted as “swellings”.\r\n\r\nPage 147: Footnote 95 (originally 2) was not referenced in the text.\r\nTranscriber has arbitrarily placed a reference to it.\r\n\r\nPage 199: “Valcleuse” currently is spelled “Valcluse”.\r\n\r\nPage 310: The reference to “Figs. 92, 93” was misprinted as\r\n“Figs. 92, 33” and has been corrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 339: Identifications of the three illustrations were added by\r\nTranscriber.\r\n\r\nPage 381: The top of the map was close to the physical book’s binding\r\nand was distorted during scanning. The Transcriber attempted to remedy\r\nthis distortion.\r\n\r\nPage 436: The letters in the diagram were printed in italics. For\r\nreadability, the Plain Text version of this eBook omits the underscores\r\nthat indicate italics. The HTML and mobile versions use an image of the\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\nPage 449 (Index): “Caves, used as places of refuge” gave no page\r\nreference. The Table of Contents refers to page 102, and the Transcriber\r\nadded that to the index entry.",
