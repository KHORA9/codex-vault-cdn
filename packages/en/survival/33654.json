My grateful thanks are due to the authorities at the\r\nBritish Museum, to Professor Burkitt of Cambridge, and very specially\r\nto Mr. J. B. Capper for invaluable help. I am indebted to Dr. James,\r\nthe Provost of Eton, for his kind permission to reproduce an\r\nillustration from a twelfth-century MS. in the Library of Eton College\r\nfor the frontispiece. I find it difficult to express either my\r\nindebtedness or my gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Charles Singer, the\r\nformer for all his help and the latter for her generous permission to\r\nmake use of her valuable bibliography of early scientific manuscripts.\r\nI am further indebted to Dr. Charles Singer for reading the chapter on\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon herbals in proof. For their kind courtesy in answering\r\nmy inquiries concerning the MS. herbals in the libraries of their\r\nrespective cathedrals, I offer my grateful thanks to the Deans of\r\nLincoln and Gloucester Cathedrals, and to the Rev. J. N. Needham for\r\ninformation concerning the herbals in the library of Durham Cathedral;\r\nto the librarians of the following colleges--All Souls' College,\r\nOxford; Balliol College, Oxford; Corpus Christi College, Oxford;\r\nCorpus Christi College, Cambridge; Emmanuel College, Cambridge;\r\nGonville and Caius College, Cambridge; Magdalene College, Cambridge;\r\nPeterhouse, Cambridge; Jesus College, Cambridge; St. John's College,\r\nOxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge; to the librarians of Durham\r\nUniversity, Trinity College, Dublin, the Royal Irish Academy, and the\r\nNational Library of Wales; to the Honble. Lady Cecil for information\r\nrespecting MSS. in the library of the late Lord Amherst of Hackney;\r\nand to the following owners of private libraries--the Marquis of Bath,\r\nLord Leconfield, Lord Clifden, Mr. T. Fitzroy Fenwick of Cheltenham,\r\nand Mr. Wynne of Peniarth, Merioneth. For information respecting\r\nincunabula herbals in American libraries I am indebted to Dr. Arnold\r\nKlebs and to Mr. Green of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis.\r\n\r\nNo pains have been spared to make the bibliographies as complete as\r\npossible, but I should be glad to be told of any errors or omissions.\r\nThere are certain editions of _Banckes's Herbal_ and _The Grete\r\nHerball_ mentioned by authorities such as Ames, Hazlitt, etc., of\r\nwhich no copies can now be found in the chief British libraries (see\r\np. 204 _et seq._). If any copies of these editions are in private\r\nlibraries I should be grateful to hear of them. The rarest printed\r\nherbal is \"_Arbolayre conten[=a]t la qualitey et vertus proprietiez\r\ndes herbes g[=o]mes et sim[=e]ces extraite de plusiers tratiers de\r\nmedicine co[=m]ent davicene de rasis de constatin de ysaac et\r\nplateaire selon le co[=n]u usaige bien correct_.\" (Supposed to have\r\nbeen printed by M. Husz at Lyons.) It is believed that there are only\r\ntwo copies of this book now extant. One is in the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, Paris; the other was sold in London, March 23, 1898, but I\r\nhave been unable to discover who is the present owner. For this or any\r\nother information I should be most grateful.\r\n\r\n                                         ELEANOUR SINCLAIR ROHDE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] It is a remarkable fact that even

That books on herbs were studied in England as early\r\nas the eighth century is certain, for we know that Boniface, \"the\r\nApostle of the Saxons,\" received letters from England asking him for\r\nbooks on simples and complaining that it was difficult to obtain the\r\nforeign herbs mentioned in those we already possessed.[2] But of these\r\nmanuscripts none have survived, the oldest we possess being of the\r\ntenth century, and for our knowledge of Anglo-Saxon plant lore we look\r\nchiefly to those four important manuscripts--the _Leech Book of Bald_,\r\nthe _Lacnunga_ and the Saxon translations of the _Herbarium of\r\nApuleius_ and the so-called +Peri Didaxeôn+.\r\n\r\nApart from their intrinsic fascination, there are certain\r\nconsiderations which give these manuscripts a peculiar importance.\r\nHerb lore and folk medicine lag not years, but centuries, behind the\r\nknowledge of their own day. Within living memory our peasants were\r\nusing, and in the most remote parts of these islands they use still,\r\nthe herbal and other remedies of our Saxon ancestors. They even use\r\ncuriously similar charms. The herb lore recorded in these manuscripts\r\nis the herb lore, not of the century in which they were written, but\r\nof the dim past ages pictured in the oldest parts of _Widsith_ and\r\n_Beowulf_. To the student of English plant lore, the _Herbarium of\r\nApuleius_ and the +Peri Didaxeôn+ are less interesting because they\r\nare translations, but the more one studies the original Saxon writings\r\non herbs and their uses, the more one realises that, just as in\r\n_Beowulf_ there are suggestions and traces of an age far older than\r\nthat in which the poem was written, so in these manuscripts are\r\nembedded beliefs which carry us back to the dawn of history. It is\r\nthis which gives this plant lore its supreme interest. It is almost\r\noverwhelming to recognise that possibly we have here fragments of the\r\nplant lore of our ancestors who lived when Attila's hordes were\r\ndevastating Europe, and that in the charms and ceremonies connected\r\nwith the picking and administering of herbs we are carried back to\r\nforms of religion so ancient that, compared to it, the worship of\r\nWoden is modern. Further, it is only in these manuscripts that we find\r\nthis herb lore, for in the whole range of Saxon literature outside\r\nthem there is remarkably little mention of plant life. The great world\r\nof nature, it is true, is ever present; the ocean is the background of\r\nthe action in both _Beowulf_ and _Cynewulf_, and the sound of the wind\r\nand the sea is in every line. One is conscious of vast trackless\r\nwastes of heath and moor, of impenetrable forests and terror-infested\r\nbogs; but of the details of plant life there is scarcely a word. In\r\nthese manuscripts alone do we find what plant life meant to our\r\nancestors, and, as with all primitive nations, their belief in the\r\nmystery of herbs is almost past our civilised understanding. Their\r\nplant lore, hoary with age, is redolent of a time when the tribes were\r\nstill wandering on the mainland of Europe, and in these first records\r\nof this plant lore there is the breath of mighty forests, of marsh\r\nlands and of Nature in her wildest. We are swept back to an epoch when\r\nman fought with Nature, wresting from her the land, and when the\r\nunseen powers of evil resented this conquest of their domains. To the\r\nearly Saxons those unseen powers were an everyday reality. A\r\nsupernatural terror brooded over the trackless heaths, the dark mere\r\npools were inhabited by the water elves. In the wreathing mists and\r\ndriving storms of snow and hail they saw the uncouth \"moor gangers,\"\r\n\"the muckle mark steppers who hold the moors,\" or the stalking fiends\r\nof the lonely places, creatures whose baleful eyes shone like flames\r\nthrough the mist. To this day some of our place names in the more\r\nremote parts of these islands recall the memory of those evil terrors.\r\nIn these manuscripts we are again in an atmosphere of eotens and\r\ntrolls, there are traces of even older terrors, when the first Teuton\r\nsettlers in Europe struggled with the aborigines who lived in caves,\r\nhints as elusive as the phantom heroes in the Saxon poems, and as\r\nunforgettable.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable is the fact that beneath the superstructure of\r\nChristian rites to be used when the herbs were being picked or\r\nadministered we find traces not merely of the ancient heathen\r\nreligion, but of a religion older than that of Woden. It has been\r\nemphasised by our most eminent authorities that in very early times\r\nour ancestors had but few chief gods, and it is a remarkable fact that\r\nthere is no mention whatever of Woden in the whole range of Saxon\r\nliterature before the time of Alfred. In those earlier centuries they\r\nseem to have worshipped a personification of Heaven, and Earth, the\r\nwife of Heaven, and the Son, whom after ages called Thor. There were\r\nalso Nature deities, Hrede, the personification of the brightness of\r\nSummer, and Eostra, the radiant creature of the Dawn. It will be\r\nremembered that it was the worship, not of Balder, but of Eostra,\r\nwhich the Christian missionaries found so deeply imbedded that they\r\nadopted her name and transferred it to Easter. For this we have the\r\nauthority of Bede. Separate from these beneficent powers were the\r\ndestroying and harmful powers of Nature--darkness, storm, frost and\r\nthe deadly vapours of moorland and fen, personified in the giants, the\r\nogres, the furious witches that rode the winds and waves; in fact, the\r\nwhole horde of demons of sea and land and sky. It is the traces of\r\nthese most ancient forms of religion which give to the manuscripts\r\ntheir strongest fascination.\r\n\r\nMany of us miss all that is most worth learning in old books through\r\nregarding anything in them that is unfamiliar as merely quaint, if not\r\nridiculous. This attitude seals a book as effectually and as\r\npermanently as it seals a sensitive human being. There is only one way\r\nof understanding these old writers, and that is to forget ourselves\r\nentirely and to try to look at the world of nature as they did. It is\r\nnot \"much learning\" that is required, but sympathy and imagination. In\r\nthe case of these Saxon manuscripts we are repaid a thousandfold; for\r\nthey transport us to an age far older than our own, and yet in some\r\nways so young that we have lost its magic key. For we learn not only\r\nof herbs and the endless uses our forefathers made of them, but, if we\r\ntry to read them with understanding, these books open for us a magic\r\ncasement through which we look upon the past bathed in a glamour of\r\nromance. Our Saxon ancestors may have been a rude and hardy race, but\r\nthey did not live in an age of materialism as we do. In their writings\r\non herbs and their uses we see \"as through a glass darkly\" a time when\r\ngrown men believed in elves and goblins as naturally as they believed\r\nin trees, an age when it was the belief of everyday folk that the air\r\nwas peopled with unseen powers of evil against whose machinations\r\ndefinite remedies must be applied. They believed, as indeed the people\r\nof all ancient civilisations have believed, that natural forces and\r\nnatural objects were endued with mysterious powers whom it was\r\nnecessary to propitiate by special prayers. Not only the stars of\r\nheaven, but springs of water and the simple wayside herbs, were to\r\nthem directly associated with unseen beings. There are times when one\r\nis reminded forcibly of that worship of Demeter, \"nearer to the Earth\r\nwhich some have thought they could discern behind the definitely\r\nnational mythology of Homer.\" They believed that the sick could be\r\ncured by conjurations and charms, as firmly as we believe to-day in\r\ncuring them by suggestion--is there any real difference between these\r\nmethods?--and when one reads the charms which they used in\r\nadministering their herbs one cannot help wondering whether these were\r\nhanded down traditionally from the Sumerians, those ancient\r\ninhabitants of Mesopotamia who five thousand years before Christ used\r\ncharms for curing the sick which have now been partially deciphered\r\nfrom the cuneiform inscriptions. But before studying the plant lore\r\ntherein contained, it may be as well to take a preliminary survey of\r\nthe four most important manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Saxon book dealing with the virtues of herbs which we\r\npossess is the _Leech Book of Bald_, dating from about A.D. 900-950.\r\nUnlike some other MS. herbals of which only a few tattered pages\r\nremain, this perfect specimen of Saxon work has nothing fragile about\r\nit. The vellum is as strong and in as good condition as when it first\r\nlay clean and untouched under the hand of the scribe--Cild by\r\nname--who penned it with such skill and loving care. One's imagination\r\nruns riot when one handles this beautiful book, now over a thousand\r\nyears old, and wonders who were its successive owners and how it has\r\nsurvived the wars and other destructive agencies through all these\r\ncenturies. But we only know that, at least for a time, it was\r\nsheltered in that most romantic of all English monasteries,\r\nGlastonbury.[3] This Saxon manuscript has a dignity which is unique,\r\nfor it is the oldest existing leech book written in the vernacular. In\r\na lecture delivered before the Royal College of Physicians in 1903,\r\nDr. J. F. Payne commented on the remarkable fact that the Anglo-Saxons\r\nhad a much wider knowledge of herbs than the doctors of Salerno, the\r\noldest school of medicine and oldest university in Europe. \"No\r\ntreatise,\" he said, \"of the School of Salerno contemporaneous with the\r\n_Leech Book of Bald_ is known, so that the Anglo-Saxons had the credit\r\nof priority. Their Leech Book was the first medical treatise written\r\nin Western Europe which can be said to belong to modern history, that\r\nis, which was produced after the decadence and decline of the\r\nclassical medicine, which belongs to ancient history.... It seems fair\r\nto regard it [the Leech Book], in a sense, as the embryo of modern\r\nEnglish medicine, and at all events the earliest medical treatise\r\nproduced by any of the modern nations of Europe.\" The Anglo-Saxons\r\ncreated a vernacular literature to which the continental nations at\r\nthat time could show no parallel, and in the branch of literature\r\nconnected with medicine, in those days based on a knowledge of herbs\r\n(when it was not magic), their position was unique. Moreover, the fact\r\nthat the Leech Book was written in the vernacular is in itself\r\nremarkable, for it points to the existence of a class of men who were\r\nnot Latin scholars and yet were able and willing to read books. The\r\nLeech Book belongs to the literary period commonly known as the school\r\nof Alfred. It was probably written shortly after Alfred's death, but\r\nit is more than probable that it is a copy of a much older manuscript,\r\nfor what is known as the third book of the Leech Book is evidently a\r\nshorter and older work incorporated by the scribe when he had finished\r\nthe Leech Book proper.\r\n\r\nThe book itself was written under the direction of one Bald, who, if\r\nhe were not a personal friend of King Alfred's, had at any rate access\r\nto the king's correspondence; for one chapter consists of\r\nprescriptions sent by Helias, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to the king.[4]\r\nWe learn the names of the first owner and scribe from lines in Latin\r\nverse at the end of the second part of the MS.\r\n\r\n    \"Bald is the owner of this book, which he ordered Cild to write,\r\n    Earnestly I pray here all men, in the name of Christ,\r\n    That no treacherous person take this book from me,\r\n    Neither by force nor by theft nor by any false statement.\r\n    Why? Because the richest treasure is not so dear to me\r\n    As my dear books which the Grace of Christ attends.\"\r\n\r\nThe book consists of 109 leaves and is written in a large, bold hand\r\nand one or two of the initial letters are very faintly illuminated.\r\nThe writing is an exceptionally fine specimen of Saxon penmanship. On\r\nmany of the pages there are mysterious marks, but it is impossible to\r\nconjecture their meaning. It has been suggested that they point to the\r\nsources from which the book was compiled and were inserted by the\r\noriginal owner.\r\n\r\nThe _Leech Book of Bald_ was evidently the manual of a Saxon doctor,\r\nand he refers to two other doctors--Dun and Oxa by name--who had given\r\nhim prescriptions. The position of the leech in those days must have\r\nbeen very trying, for he was subjected to the obviously unfair\r\ncompetition of the higher clergy, many of whom enjoyed a reputation\r\nfor working miraculous cures.[5] The leech being so inferior in\r\nposition, it is not surprising that his medical knowledge did not\r\nadvance on scientific lines. He relied on the old heathen\r\nsuperstitions, probably from an instinctive feeling that in pagan\r\nreligion, combined with the herb lore which had been handed down\r\nthrough the ages, the mass of the people had a deep-rooted faith.\r\nNothing is more obvious in the Leech Book than the fact that the\r\nvirtues ascribed to the different herbs are based not on the personal\r\nknowledge of the writer, but on the old herb lore. This gives the\r\nLeech Book its special fascination; for it is the oldest surviving\r\nmanuscript in which we can learn the herb lore of our ancestors,\r\nhanded down to them from what dim past ages we can only surmise. We\r\nhave, therefore, to bear in mind that what may strike our modern minds\r\nas quaint, or even grotesque, is in the majority of instances a\r\ndistorted form of lore which doubtless suffered many changes during\r\nthe early centuries of our era. Nearly all that is most fascinating in\r\nthe Leech Book is of very ancient Indo-Germanic or Eastern origin, but\r\none cannot help wondering how much the Saxons incorporated of the herb\r\nlore of the ancient Britons. Does not Pliny tell us that the Britons\r\ngathered herbs with such striking ceremonies that it would seem as\r\nthough the Britons had taught them to the Persians?\r\n\r\nOne cannot read Bald's manuscript without being struck by his\r\nremarkable knowledge of native plants and garden herbs. We are\r\ninferior to our continental neighbours in so many arts that it is\r\npleasant to find that in the ancient art of gardening and in their\r\nknowledge of herbs our Saxon forefathers excelled. It has been pointed\r\nout by eminent authorities that the Anglo-Saxons had names for, and\r\nused, a far larger number of plants than the continental nations. In\r\nthe _Herbarium of Apuleius_, including the additions from Dioscorides,\r\nonly 185 plants are mentioned, and this was one of the standard works\r\nof the early Middle Ages. In the _Herbarius_ of 1484, the earliest\r\nherbal printed in Germany, only 150 plants are recorded, and in the\r\nGerman _Herbarius_ of 1485 there are 380. But from various sources it\r\nhas been computed that the Anglo-Saxons had names for, and used, at\r\nleast 500 plants.[6] One feels instinctively that the love of flowers\r\nand gardens was as deep-rooted in our ancestors as it is in our nation\r\nto-day, and though we do not know exactly what they grew in their\r\ngardens--which they called wyrt[gh]erd (literally, herb-yard)--we do\r\nknow that the marigolds, sunflowers, peonies, violets and\r\ngilly-flowers which make the cottage gardens of England so gay and\r\nfull of colour to-day were also the commonest plants in the Saxon\r\ngardens. Fashions in large gardens have changed throughout the\r\ncenturies, and there are stately gardens in this country famed the\r\nworld over. But in regard to our cottage gardens we are staunchly\r\nconservative, and it is assuredly the cottage garden which is\r\ncharacteristically English. Incidentally, one cannot help regretting\r\nthat so many of our old Saxon plant names have fallen into disuse.\r\n\"Waybroad,\" for instance, is much more descriptive than \"plantain,\"\r\nwhich is misleading.[7] \"Maythen\" also is surely preferable to\r\n\"camomile,\" and \"wergulu\" is more characteristic of that fierce weed\r\nthan \"nettle.\" Those of us who are gardeners will certainly agree that\r\n\"unfortraedde\" is the right name for knotweed. And is not \"joy of the\r\nground\" a delightful name for periwinkle?\r\n\r\nThe oldest illustrated herbal which has come down to us from Saxon\r\ntimes is the translation of the Latin _Herbarium Apuleii\r\nPlatonici_.[8] The original Latin work is believed to date from the\r\nfifth century, though no copy so ancient as this is in existence now.\r\nThe name Apuleius Platonicus is possibly fictitious and nothing is\r\nknown of the writer, who was, of course, distinct from Apuleius\r\nMadaurensis, the author of the _Golden Ass_. The Saxon translation of\r\nthis herbal (now in the British Museum) is supposed to date from A.D.\r\n1000-1050, and belongs to the school of Ælfric of Canterbury. The\r\nfrontispiece is a coloured picture in which Plato is represented\r\nholding a large volume which is being given him by Æsculapius and the\r\nCentaur, and on the other side of the page is a blue circle spotted\r\nwith white and red, within which is the name of the book: \"Herbarium\r\nApuleii Platonici quod accepit ab Escolapio et Chirone centauro\r\nmagistro Achillis.\" The book consists of 132 chapters, in each of\r\nwhich a herb is described, and there are accompanying illustrations of\r\nthe herbs. Throughout the book there are also remarkable pictures of\r\nsnakes, scorpions and unknown winged creatures. It has been pointed\r\nout that the figures of herbs are obviously not from the original\r\nplants, but are copied from older figures, and these from others older\r\nstill, and one wonders what the original pictures were like. It is\r\ninteresting to think that perhaps the illustrations in this Saxon\r\nherbal are directly descended, so to speak, from the drawings of\r\nCratevas,[9] Dionysius or Metrodorus, of whom Pliny tells us \"They\r\ndrew the likeness of herbs and wrote under them their effects.\" The\r\npicture of the lily is very attractive in spite of the fact that the\r\nflowers are painted pale blue. The stamens in the figure stand out\r\nbeyond the petals and look like rays of light, with a general effect\r\nthat is curiously pleasing. One of the most interesting figures is\r\nthat of the mandrake (painted in a deep madder), which embodies the\r\nold legend that it was death to dig up the root, and that therefore a\r\ndog was tied to a rope and made to drag it up. It is the opinion of\r\nsome authorities that these figures show the influence of the school\r\nrepresented by the two splendid Vienna manuscripts of Dioscorides\r\ndating from the fifth and seventh centuries. There is no definite\r\nevidence of this, and though the illustrations in the Saxon manuscript\r\nshow the influence of the classical tradition, they are poor compared\r\nwith those in the Vienna manuscript. To some extent at least the\r\ndrawings in this herbal must necessarily have been copies, for many of\r\nthe plants are species unknown in this country.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ÆSCULAPIUS PLATO AND A CENTAUR\r\n      From the Saxon translation of the _Herbarium of Apuleius_\r\n      (Cott. Vit., C. 3, folio 19_a_)]\r\n\r\nThe Saxon translation of the +Peri Didaxeôn+ (Harl. 6258) is a thin\r\nvolume badly mutilated in parts. Herr Max Löwenbeck[10] has shown that\r\nthis is in part translated from a treatise by an eleventh-century\r\nwriter, Petrocellus or Petronius, of the School of Salerno--the\r\noriginal treatise being entitled _Practica Petrocelli Salernitani_.[11]\r\nAs has been pointed out by many eminent authorities, the School of\r\nSalerno, being a survival of Greek medicine, was uncontaminated by\r\nsuperstitious medicine. Consequently there are striking differences\r\nbetween this and the other Saxon manuscripts. The large majority of the\r\nherbs mentioned are those of Southern Europe, and the pharmacy is very\r\nsimple compared with the number of herbs in prescriptions of native\r\norigin. As Dr. J. F. Payne[12] has pointed out, Herr Löwenbeck's\r\nimportant discovery does not account for the whole of the English book.\r\nThe order of the chapters differs from that of the Salernitan writer;\r\nthere are passages not to be found in the _Practica_, and in some\r\nplaces the English text gives a fuller reading. It is fairly evident\r\nthat the Saxon treatise is at least in part indebted to the\r\n_Passionarius_ by Gariopontus, another Salernitan writer of the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe _Lacnunga_ (Harl. 585), an original work, and one of the oldest\r\nand most interesting manuscripts, is a small, thick volume without any\r\nillustrations. Some of the letters are illuminated and some are rudely\r\nornamented. At the top of the first page there is the inscription\r\n\"Liber Humfredi Wanley,\" and it is interesting, therefore, to realise\r\nthat the British Museum owes this treasure to the zealous antiquarian\r\nwhose efforts during the closing years of the seventeenth and early\r\nyears of the eighteenth century rescued so many valuable Saxon and\r\nother MSS. from oblivion.[13]\r\n\r\nTo the student of folk lore and folk custom these sources of herb lore\r\nare of remarkable interest for the light they throw on the beliefs and\r\ncustoms of humble everyday people in Anglo-Saxon times. Of kings and\r\nwarriors, of bards and of great ladies we can read in other Saxon\r\nliterature, and all so vividly that we see their halls, the long\r\nhearths on which the fires were piled, the openings in the roof\r\nthrough which the smoke passed. We see the men with their \"byrnies\" of\r\nring mail, their crested helmets, their leather-covered shields and\r\ndeadly short swords. We see them and their womenkind wearing golden\r\nornaments at their feasts, the tables laden with boars' flesh and\r\nvenison and chased cups of ale and mead. We see these same halls at\r\nnight with the men sleeping, their \"byrnies\" and helmets hanging near\r\nthem, and in the dim light we can make out also the trophies of the\r\nchase hanging on the walls. We read of their mighty deeds, and we know\r\nat least something of the ideals and the thoughts of their great men\r\nand heroes. But what of that vast number of the human kind who were\r\nalways in the background? What of the hewers of wood and drawers of\r\nwater, the swineherds, the shepherds, the carpenters, the hedgers and\r\ncobblers? Is it not wonderful to think that in these manuscripts we\r\ncan learn, at least to some extent, what plant life meant to these\r\neveryday folk? And even in these days to understand what plant life\r\nmeans to the true countryman is to get into very close touch with him.\r\nNot only has suburban life separated the great concentrated masses of\r\nour people from their birthright of meadows, fields and woods; of\r\nNature, in her untamed splendour and mystery, most of them have never\r\nhad so much as a momentary glimpse. But in Saxon times even the towns\r\nwere not far from the unreclaimed marshes and forests, and to the\r\npeasant in those days they were full not only of seen, but also of\r\nunseen perils. There was probably not a Saxon child who did not know\r\nsomething of the awe of waste places and impenetrable forests. Even\r\nthe hamlets lay on the very edge of forests and moors, and to the\r\npeasant these were haunted by giant, elf and monster, as in the more\r\ninaccessible parts of these islands they are haunted still to those\r\nwho retain something of primitive imagination. And when we study the\r\nplant lore of these people we realise that prince and peasant alike\r\nused the simple but mysterious herbs not only to cure them of both\r\nphysical and mental ills, but to guard them from these unseen\r\nmonsters. Of the reverence they paid to herbs we begin to have some\r\ndim apprehension when we read of the ceremonies connected with the\r\npicking and administering of them.\r\n\r\nBut, first, what can we learn of the beliefs as to the origin of\r\ndisease? Concerning this the great bulk of the folk lore in these\r\nmanuscripts is apparently of native Teutonic origin, or rather it\r\nwould be more correct to speak of its origin as Indo-Germanic; for the\r\nsame doctrines are to be found among all Indo-Germanic peoples, and\r\neven in the Vedas, notably the Atharva Veda. Of these beliefs, the\r\ndoctrine of the \"elf-shot\" occupies a large space, the longest chapter\r\nin the third book of the _Leech Book of Bald_ being entirely \"against\r\nelf-disease.\" We know from their literature that to our Saxon\r\nancestors waste places of moor and forest and marshes were the resort\r\nof a host of supernatural creatures at enmity with mankind. In the\r\n_Leech Book of Bald_ disease is largely ascribed to these elves, whose\r\nshafts produced illness in their victims. We read of beorg-ælfen,\r\ndun-ælfen, muntælfen. But our modern word \"elf\" feebly represents\r\nthese creatures, who were more akin to the \"mark-stalkers,\" to the\r\ncreatures of darkness with loathsome eyes, rather than to the fairies\r\nwith whom we now associate the name. For the most part these elves of\r\nancient times were joyless impersonations and creatures not of sun but\r\nof darkness and winter. In the gloom and solitude of the forest,\r\n\"where the bitter wormwood stood pale grey\" and where \"the hoar stones\r\nlay thick,\" the black, giant elves had their dwelling. They claimed\r\nthe forest for their own and hated man because bit by bit he was\r\nwresting the forest from them. Yet they made for man those mystic\r\nswords of superhuman workmanship engraved with magic runes and dipped\r\nwhen red hot in blood or in a broth of poisonous herbs and twigs. We\r\ndo not understand, we can only ask, why did they make them? What is\r\nthe meaning of the myth? The water elves recall the sea monsters who\r\nattended Grendel's dam, impersonations of the fury of the waves, akin\r\nto Hnikarr, and again other water elves of the cavernous bed of ocean,\r\nprimeval deadly creatures, inhabiting alike the sea and the desolate\r\nfens, \"where the elk-sedge waxed in the water.\" If some were akin to\r\nthe Formori of the baleful fogs in Irish mythic history and the\r\nMallt-y-nos, those she-demons of marshy lands immortalised by the\r\nWelsh bards, creatures huge and uncouth \"with grey and glaring eyes,\"\r\nthere were others who exceeded in beauty anything human. When Cædmon\r\nwrote of the beauty of Sarah, he described her as \"sheen as an elf.\"\r\nWith the passing of the centuries we have well-nigh forgotten the\r\nblack elves, though they are still realities to the Highlander and too\r\nreal for him to speak of them. But have we not the descendants of the\r\nsheen bright elves in the works of Shakespeare, Milton and Shelley?\r\nOne feels very sure that our Saxon ancestors would have understood\r\nthat glittering elf Ariel as few of us are capable of understanding\r\nhim. He is the old English bright elf. Did not Prospero subdue him\r\nwith magic, as our ancestors used magic songs in administering herbs\r\n\"to quell the elf\"? Here is one such song from the _Leech Book of\r\nBald_, and at the end a conjuration to bury the elf in the earth.\r\n\r\n    \"I have wreathed round the wounds\r\n    The best of healing wreaths\r\n    That the baneful sores may\r\n    Neither burn nor burst,\r\n    Nor find their way further,\r\n    Nor turn foul and fallow.\r\n    Nor thump and throle on,\r\n    Nor be wicked wounds,\r\n    Nor dig deeply down;\r\n    But he himself may hold\r\n    In a way to health.\r\n    Let it ache thee no more\r\n    Than ear in Earth acheth.\r\n\r\n\"Sing also this many times, 'May earth bear on thee with all her might\r\nand main.'\"--_Leech Book of Bald_, III. 63.\r\n\r\nThis was for one \"in the water elf disease,\" and we read that a person\r\nso afflicted would have livid nails and tearful eyes, and would look\r\ndownwards. Amongst the herbs to be administered when the charm was\r\nsung over him were a yew-berry, lupin, helenium, marsh mallow, dock\r\nelder, wormwood and strawberry leaves.\r\n\r\nGoblins and nightmare were regarded as at least akin to elves, and we\r\nfind the same herbs were to be used against them, betony being of\r\npeculiar efficacy against \"monstrous nocturnal visions and against\r\nfrightful visions and dreams.\"[14] The malicious elves did not confine\r\ntheir attacks to human beings; references to elf-shot cattle are\r\nnumerous. I quote the following from the chapter \"against elf\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\n    \"For that ilk [_i. e._ for one who is elf-shot].\r\n\r\n    \"Go on Thursday evening when the sun is set where thou\r\n    knowest that helenium stands, then sing the Benedicite and\r\n    Pater Noster and a litany and stick thy knife into the wort,\r\n    make it stick fast and go away; go again when day and night\r\n    just divide; at the same period go first to church and cross\r\n    thyself and commend thyself to God; then go in silence and,\r\n    though anything soever of an awful sort or man meet thee,\r\n    say not thou to him any word ere thou come to the wort which\r\n    on the evening before thou markedst; then sing the\r\n    Benedicite and the Pater Noster and a litany, delve up the\r\n    wort, let the knife stick in it; go again as quickly as thou\r\n    art able to church and let it lie under the altar with the\r\n    knife; let it lie till the sun be up, wash it afterwards,\r\n    and make into a drink with bishopwort and lichen off a\r\n    crucifix; boil in milk thrice, thrice pour holy water upon\r\n    it and sing over it the Pater Noster, the Credo and the\r\n    Gloria in Excelsis Deo, and sing upon it a litany and score\r\n    with a sword round about it on three sides a cross, and then\r\n    after that let the man drink the wort; Soon it will be well\r\n    with him.\"--_Leech Book_, III. 62.\r\n\r\nThe instructions for a horse or cattle that are elf-shot runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"If a horse or other neat be elf-shot take sorrel-seed or\r\n    Scotch wax, let a man sing twelve Masses over it and put\r\n    holy water on the horse or on whatsoever neat it be; have\r\n    the worts always with thee. For the same take the eye of a\r\n    broken needle, give the horse a prick with it, no harm shall\r\n    come.\"--_Leech Book of Bald_, I. 88.\r\n\r\nAnother prescription for an elf-shot horse runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"If a horse be elf-shot, then take the knife of which the\r\n    haft is the horn of a fallow ox and on which are three brass\r\n    nails, then write upon the horse's forehead Christ's mark\r\n    and on each of the limbs which thou mayst feel at: then take\r\n    the left ear, prick a hole in it in silence, this thou shalt\r\n    do; then strike the horse on the back, then will it be\r\n    whole.--And write upon the handle of the knife these words--\r\n\r\n    \"Benedicite omnia opera Domini dominum.\r\n\r\n    \"Be the elf what it may, this is mighty for him to\r\n    amend.\"--_Leech Book of Bald_, I. 65.[15]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the doctrine of the elf-shot is that of \"flying\r\nvenom.\" It is, of course, possible to regard the phrase as the graphic\r\nAnglo-Saxon way of describing infectious diseases; but the various\r\nsynonymous phrases, \"the on-flying things,\" \"the loathed things that\r\nrove through the land,\" suggest something of more malignant activity.\r\nAs a recent leading article in _The Times_ shows, we are as a matter\r\nof fact not much wiser than our Saxon ancestors as to the origin of an\r\nepidemic such as influenza.[16] Indeed, to talk of \"catching\" a cold\r\nor any infectious disease would have struck an Anglo-Saxon as\r\nludicrous, mankind being rather the victims of \"flying venom.\" In the\r\nalliterative lay in the _Lacnunga_, part of which is given below, the\r\nwind is described as blowing these venoms, which produced disease in\r\nthe bodies on which they lighted, their evil effects being\r\nsubsequently blown away by the magician's song and the efficacy of\r\nsalt and water and herbs. This is generally supposed to be in its\r\norigin a heathen lay of great antiquity preserved down to Christian\r\ntimes, when allusions to the new religion were inserted. It is written\r\nin the Wessex dialect and is believed to be of the tenth century, but\r\nit is undoubtedly a reminiscence of some far older lay. The lay or\r\ncharm is in praise of nine sacred herbs (one a tree)--mugwort,\r\nwaybroad (plantain), stime (watercress), atterlothe (?), maythen\r\n(camomile), wergulu (nettle), crab apple, chervil and fennel.\r\n\r\n    \"These nine attack\r\n      against nine venoms.\r\n    A worm came creeping,\r\n      he tore asunder a man.\r\n    Then took Woden\r\n      nine magic twigs,\r\n    [&] then smote the serpent\r\n      that he in nine [bits] dispersed.\r\n    Now these nine herbs have power\r\n      against nine magic outcasts\r\n      against nine venoms\r\n      & against nine flying things\r\n      [& have might] against the loathed things\r\n      that over land rove.\r\n      Against the red venoms\r\n      against the runlan [?] venom\r\n      against the white venom\r\n      against the blue [?] venom\r\n      against the yellow venom\r\n      against the green venom\r\n      against the dusky venom\r\n      against the brown venom\r\n      against the purple venom.\r\n      Against worm blast\r\n      against water blast\r\n      against thorn blast\r\n      against thistle blast\r\n      Against ice blast\r\n      Against venom blast\r\n      .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n      if any venom come\r\n      flying from east\r\n      or any come from north\r\n      [or any from south]\r\n      or any from west\r\n      over mankind\r\n    I alone know a running river\r\n      and the nine serpents behold [it]\r\n    All weeds must\r\n      now to herbs give way,\r\n      Seas dissolve\r\n      [and] all salt water\r\n      when I this venom\r\n      from thee blow.\"[17]\r\n\r\nIn the chapter in the _Leech Book of Bald_[18] containing the\r\nprescriptions sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to King Alfred, we\r\nfind among the virtues of the \"white stone\" that it is \"powerful\r\nagainst flying venom and against all uncouth things,\" and in another\r\npassage[19] that these venoms are particularly dangerous \"fifteen\r\nnights ere Lammas and after it for five and thirty nights: leeches who\r\nwere wisest have taught that in that month no man should anywhere\r\nweaken his body except there were a necessity for it.\" In the most\r\nancient source of Anglo-Saxon medicine--the _Lacnunga_--we find the\r\nfollowing \"salve\" for flying venom:--\r\n\r\n    \"A salve for flying venom. Take a handful of hammer wort and\r\n    a handful of maythe (camomile) and a handful of waybroad\r\n    (plantain) and roots of water dock, seek those which will\r\n    float, and one eggshell full of clean honey, then take clean\r\n    butter, let him who will help to work up the salve melt it\r\n    thrice: let one sing a mass over the worts, before they are\r\n    put together and the salve is wrought up.\"[20]\r\n\r\nBut it is in the doctrine of the worm as the ultimate source of\r\ndisease that we are carried back to the most ancient of sagas. The\r\ndragon and the worm, the supreme enemy of man, which play so\r\ndominating a part in Saxon literature, are here set down as the source\r\nof all ill. In the alliterative lay in the _Lacnunga_ the opening\r\nlines describe the war between Woden and the Serpent. Disease arose\r\nfrom the nine fragments into which he smote the serpent, and these\r\ndiseases, blown by the wind, are counteracted by the nine magic twigs\r\nand salt water and herbs with which the disease is again blown away\r\nfrom the victim by the power of the magician's song. This is the\r\natmosphere of the great earth-worm Fafnir in the Volsunga Saga and the\r\ndragon in all folk tales, the great beast with whom the heroes of all\r\nnations have contended. Further, it is noteworthy that not only in\r\nAnglo-Saxon medicine, but for many centuries afterwards, even minor\r\nailments were ascribed to the presence of a worm--notably toothache.\r\nIn the _Leech Book_ we find toothache ascribed to a worm in the tooth\r\n(see _Leech Book_, II. 121). It is impossible in a book of this size\r\nto deal with the comparative folk lore of this subject, but in passing\r\nit is interesting to recall an incantation for toothache from the\r\nBabylonian cuneiform texts[21] in which we find perhaps the oldest\r\nexample of this belief.\r\n\r\n    \"The Marshes created the Worm,\r\n    Came the Worm and wept before Shamash,\r\n    What wilt thou give me for my food?\r\n    What wilt thou give me to devour?\r\n    .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Let me drink among the teeth\r\n    And set me on the gums,\r\n    That I may devour the blood of the teeth\r\n    And of the gums destroy their strength.\r\n    Then shall I hold the bolt of the door.\r\n    .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    So must thou say this, O Worm,\r\n    May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist.\"\r\n\r\nClosely interwoven with these elements of Indo-Germanic origin we find\r\nthe ancient Eastern doctrine which ascribes disease to demoniac\r\npossession. The exorcisms were originally heathen charms, and even in\r\nthe _Leech Book_ there are many interesting survivals of these,\r\nalthough Christian rites have to a large extent been substituted for\r\nthem. Both mandrake and periwinkle were supposed to be endowed with\r\nmysterious powers against demoniacal possession. At the end of the\r\ndescription of the mandrake in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ there is\r\nthis prescription:--\r\n\r\n    \"For witlessness, that is devil sickness or demoniacal\r\n    possession, take from the body of this same wort mandrake by\r\n    the weight of three pennies, administer to drink in warm\r\n    water as he may find most convenient--soon he will be\r\n    healed.\"--_Herb. Ap._, 32.\r\n\r\nOf periwinkle we read:--\r\n\r\n    \"This wort is of good advantage for many purposes, that is\r\n    to say first against devil sickness and demoniacal\r\n    possessions and against snakes and wild beasts and against\r\n    poisons and for various wishes and for envy and for terror\r\n    and that thou mayst have grace, and if thou hast the wort\r\n    with thee thou shalt be prosperous and ever acceptable. This\r\n    wort thou shalt pluck thus, saying, 'I pray thee, vinca\r\n    pervinca, thee that art to be had for thy many useful\r\n    qualities, that thou come to me glad blossoming with thy\r\n    mainfulness, that thou outfit me so that I be shielded and\r\n    ever prosperous and undamaged by poisons and by water;' when\r\n    thou shalt pluck this wort thou shalt be clean of every\r\n    uncleanness, and thou shalt pick it when the moon is nine\r\n    nights old and eleven nights and thirteen nights and thirty\r\n    nights and when it is one night old.\"--_Herb. Ap._\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MANDRAKE FROM A SAXON HERBAL\r\n      (Sloane 1975, folio 49_a_)]\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of disease we find that the material remedies, by\r\nwhich I mean remedies devoid of any mystic meaning, are with few\r\nexceptions entirely herbal. The herb drinks were made up with ale,\r\nmilk or vinegar, many of the potions were made of herbs mixed with\r\nhoney, and ointments were made of herbs worked up with butter. The\r\nmost scientific prescription is that for a vapour bath,[22] and there\r\nare suggestions for what may become fashionable once more--herb baths.\r\nThe majority of the prescriptions are for common ailments, and one\r\ncannot help being struck by the number there are for broken heads,\r\nbleeding noses and bites of mad dogs. However ignorant one may be of\r\nmedicine, it is impossible to read these old prescriptions without\r\nrealising that our ancestors were an uncommonly hardy race, for the\r\nmajority of the remedies would kill any of us modern weaklings,\r\neven if in robust health when they were administered. At times one\r\ncannot help wondering whether in those days, as not infrequently\r\nhappens now, the bulletin was issued that \"the operation was quite\r\nsuccessful, but the patient died of shock!\" And, as further evidence\r\nof the old truth that there is nothing new under the sun, it is\r\npleasant to find that doctors, even in Saxon days, prescribed\r\n\"carriage exercise,\" and moreover endeavoured to sweeten it by\r\nallowing the patient to \"lap up honey\" first. This prescription runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Against want of appetite. Let them, after the night's fast,\r\n    lap up honey, and let them seek for themselves fatigue in\r\n    riding on horseback or in a wain or such conveyance as they\r\n    may endure.\"--_Leech Book_, II. 7.\r\n\r\nIn the later herbals, \"beauty\" recipes are, as is well known, a\r\nconspicuous feature, but they find a place also in these old\r\nmanuscripts. In the third book (the oldest part) of the _Leech Book_\r\nthere is a prescription for sunburn which runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"For sunburn boil in butter tender ivy twigs, smear\r\n    therewith.\"--_Leech Book_, III. 29.\r\n\r\nAnd in _Leech Book_ II. we find this prescription:--\r\n\r\n    \"That all the body may be of a clean and glad and bright\r\n    hue, take oil and dregs of old wine equally much, put them\r\n    into a mortar, mingle well together and smear the body with\r\n    this in the sun.\"--_Leech Book_, II. 65.\r\n\r\nPrescriptions for hair falling off are fairly numerous, and there are\r\neven two--somewhat drastic--prescriptions for hair which is too thick.\r\nSowbread and watercress were both used to make hair grow, and in\r\n_Leech Book_ I. there is this prescription:--\r\n\r\n    \"If a man's hair fall off, work him a salve. Take the mickle\r\n    wolf's bane and viper's bugloss and the netherward part of\r\n    burdock, work the salve out of that wort and out of all\r\n    these and out of that butter of which no water hath come. If\r\n    hair fall off, boil the polypody fern and foment the head\r\n    with that so warm. In case that a man be bald, Plinius the\r\n    mickle leech saith this leechdom: 'Take dead bees, burn them\r\n    to ashes, add oil upon that, seethe very long over gledes,\r\n    then strain, wring out and take leaves of willow, pound\r\n    them, pour the juice into the oil; boil again for a while on\r\n    gledes, strain them, smear therewith after the\r\n    bath.'\"--_Leech Book_, I. 87.\r\n\r\nThe two prescriptions for hair which is too thick are in the same\r\nchapter:--\r\n\r\n    \"In order that the hair may not wax, take emmets' eggs, rub\r\n    them up, smudge on the place, never will any hair come up\r\n    there.\" Again: \"if hair be too thick, take a swallow, burn\r\n    it to ashes under a tile and have the ashes shed on.\"\r\n\r\nThere are more provisions against diseases of the eye than against any\r\nother complaint, and it is probably because of the prevalence of these\r\nin olden days that we still have so many of the superstitions\r\nconnected with springs of water. Both maythen (camomile) and wild\r\nlettuce were used for the eyes. In the following for mistiness of eyes\r\nthere is a touch of pathos:--\r\n\r\n    \"For mistiness of eyes, many men, lest their eyes should\r\n    suffer the disease, look into cold water and then are able\r\n    to see far.... The eyes of an old man are not sharp of\r\n    sight, then shall he wake up his eyes with rubbings, with\r\n    walkings, with ridings, either so that a man bear him or\r\n    convey him in a wain. And they shall use little and careful\r\n    meats and comb their heads and drink wormwood before they\r\n    take food. Then shall a salve be wrought for unsharpsighted\r\n    eyes; take pepper and beat it and a somewhat of salt and\r\n    wine; that will be a good salve.\"\r\n\r\nOne prescription is unique, for the \"herb\" which one is directed to\r\nuse is not to be found in any other herbal in existence. This is \"rind\r\nfrom Paradise.\" There is a grim humour about the scribe's comment, and\r\none cannot help wondering what was the origin of the prescription:--\r\n\r\n    \"Some teach us against bite of adder, to speak one word\r\n    'faul.' It may not hurt him. Against bite of snake if the\r\n    man procures and eateth rind which cometh out of Paradise,\r\n    no venom will hurt him. Then said he that wrote this book\r\n    that the rind was hard gotten.\"\r\n\r\nThese manuscripts are so full of word pictures of the treatment of\r\ndisease that one feels if one were transported back to those days it\r\nwould in most cases be possible to tell at a glance the \"cures\"\r\nvarious people were undergoing. Let us visit a Saxon hamlet and go and\r\nsee the sick folk in the cottages. On our way we meet a man with a\r\nfawn's skin decorated with little bunches of herbs dangling from his\r\nshoulders, and we know that he is a sufferer from nightmare.[23]\r\nAnother has a wreath of clove-wort tied with a red thread round his\r\nneck. He is a lunatic, but, as the moon is on the wane, his family\r\nhope that the wearing of these herbs will prove beneficial. We enter a\r\ndark one-roomed hut, the dwelling of one of the swineherds, but he is\r\nnot at his work; for it seemed to him that his head turned about and\r\nthat he was faring with turned brains. He had consulted the leech and,\r\nsuggestion cures being then rather more common than now, the leech had\r\nadvised him to sit calmly by his fireside with a linen cloth wrung out\r\nin spring water on his head and to wait till it was dry. He does so,\r\nand, to quote the words with which nearly all Saxon prescriptions end,\r\nwe feel \"it will soon be well with him.\" Let us wend our way to the\r\ncobbler, a sullen, taciturn man who finds his lively young wife's\r\nchatter unendurable. We find him looking more gloomy than usual, for\r\nhe has eaten nothing all day and now sits moodily consuming a raw\r\nradish. But there is purpose in this. Does not the ancient leechdom\r\nsay that, if a radish be eaten raw after fasting all day, no woman's\r\nchatter the next day can annoy? In another cottage we find that a\r\npatient suffering from elf-shot is to be smoked with the fumes of\r\nherbs. A huge quern stone which has been in the fire on the hearth\r\nall day is dragged out, the prepared herbs--wallwort and mugwort--are\r\nscattered upon it and also underneath, then cold water is poured on\r\nand the patient is reeked with the steam \"as hot as he can endure\r\nit.\"[24] Smoking sick folk, especially for demoniac possession, is a\r\nworld-wide practice and of very ancient origin. There is no space here\r\nto attempt to touch on the comparative folk lore of this subject.\r\nMoreover, fumigating the sick with herbs is closely akin to the\r\nburning of incense. Even in ancient Babylonian days fumigating with\r\nherbs was practised.[25] It was very common all through the Middle\r\nAges in most parts of Europe, and that it has not even yet died out is\r\nshown by the extract from _The Times_ given below.[26] I have\r\npurposely put in juxtaposition the translation of the ancient\r\nBabylonian tablet and the extract from _The Times_.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that not only human beings, but cattle and swine\r\nwere smoked with the fumes of herbs. In the _Lacnunga_, for sick\r\ncattle we find--\"Take the wort, put it upon gledes and fennel and\r\nhassuck and 'cotton' and incense. Burn all together on the side on\r\nwhich the wind is. Make it reek upon the cattle. Make five crosses of\r\nhassuck grass, set them on four sides of the cattle and one in the\r\nmiddle. Sing about the cattle the Benedicite and some litanies and the\r\nPater Noster. Sprinkle holy water upon them, burn about them incense\r\nand cotton and let someone set a value on the cattle, let the owner\r\ngive the tenth penny in the Church for God, after that leave them to\r\namend; do this thrice.\"--_Lacnunga_, 79.\r\n\r\n\"To preserve swine from sudden death sing over them four masses, drive\r\nthe swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four sides and upon the\r\ndoor, also burn them, adding incense and make the reek stream over the\r\nswine.\"--_Lacnunga_, 82.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerbs used as amulets have always played a conspicuous part in folk\r\nmedicine, and our Saxon ancestors used them, as all ancient races have\r\nused them, not merely to cure definite diseases but also as protection\r\nagainst the unseen powers of evil,[27] to preserve the eyesight, to\r\ncure lunacy, against weariness when going on a journey, against being\r\nbarked at by dogs, for safety from robbers, and in one prescription\r\neven to restore a woman stricken with speechlessness. The use of herbs\r\nas amulets to cure diseases has almost died out in this country, but\r\nthe use of them as charms to ensure good luck survives to this\r\nday--notably in the case of white heather and four-leaved clover.\r\n\r\nThere is occasionally the instruction to bind on the herb with red\r\nwool. For instance, a prescription against headache in the third book\r\nof the _Leech Book_ enjoins binding waybroad, which has been dug up\r\nwithout iron before sunrise, round the head \"with a red fillet.\"\r\nBinding on with red wool is a very ancient and widespread custom.[28]\r\nRed was the colour sacred to Thor and it was also the colour abhorred\r\nnot only by witches in particular but by all the powers of darkness\r\nand evil. An ancient Assyrian eye charm prescribes binding \"pure\r\nstrands of red wool which have been brought by the pure hand of ... on\r\nthe right hand,\" and down to quite recent times even in these islands\r\ntying on with red wool was a common custom.\r\n\r\nBesides their use as amulets, we also find instructions for hanging\r\nherbs up over doors, etc., for the benefit not only of human beings\r\nbut of cattle also. Of mugwort we read in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_,\r\n\"And if a root of this wort be hung over the door of any house then\r\nmay not any man damage the house.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Of Croton oil plant. For hail and rough weather to turn\r\n    them away. If thou hast in thy possession this wort which is\r\n    named 'ricinus' and which is not a native of England, if\r\n    thou hangest some seed of it in thine house or have it or\r\n    its seed in any place whatsoever, it turneth away the\r\n    tempestuousness of hail, and if thou hangest its seed on a\r\n    ship, to that degree wonderful it is, that it smootheth\r\n    every tempest. This wort thou shalt take saying thus, 'Wort\r\n    ricinus I pray that thou be at my songs and that thou turn\r\n    away hails and lightning bolts and all tempests through the\r\n    name of Almighty God who hight thee to be produced'; and\r\n    thou shalt be clean when thou pluckest this herb.\"--_Herb.\r\n    Ap._, 176.\r\n\r\n    \"Against temptation of the fiend, a wort hight red niolin,\r\n    red stalk, it waxeth by running water; if thou hast it on\r\n    thee and under thy head and bolster and over thy house door\r\n    the devil may not scathe thee within nor without.\"--_Leech\r\n    Book_, III. 58.\r\n\r\n    \"To preserve swine from sudden death take the worts lupin,\r\n    bishopwort, hassuck grass, tufty thorn, vipers bugloss,\r\n    drive the swine to the fold, hang the worts upon the four\r\n    sides and upon the door.\"--_Lacnunga_, 82.\r\n\r\nThe herbs in commonest use as amulets were betony, vervain, peony,\r\nyarrow, mugwort and waybroad (plantain). With the exception of\r\nvervain, no herb was more highly prized than betony. The treatise on\r\nit in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_ is supposed to be an abridged copy\r\nof a treatise on the virtues of this plant written by Antonius Musa,\r\nphysician to the Emperor Augustus. No fewer than twenty-nine uses of\r\nit are given, and in the Saxon translation this herb is described as\r\nbeing \"good whether for a man's soul or his body.\" Vervain was one of\r\nthe herbs held most sacred by the Druids and, as the herbals of Gerard\r\nand Parkinson testify, it was in high repute even as late as the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It has never been satisfactorily\r\nidentified, though many authorities incline to the belief that it was\r\nverbena. In Druidical times libations of honey had to be offered to\r\nthe earth from which it was dug, mystic ceremonies attended the\r\ndigging of it and the plant was lifted out with the left hand. This\r\nuprooting had always to be performed at the rising of the dog star and\r\nwhen neither the sun nor the moon was shining. Why the humble waybroad\r\nshould occupy so prominent a place in Saxon herb lore it is difficult\r\nto understand. It is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative\r\nlay in the _Lacnunga_, and the epithets \"mother of worts\" and \"open\r\nfrom eastwards\" are applied to it. The latter curious epithet is also\r\napplied to it in _Lacnunga_ 46,--\"which spreadeth open towards the\r\nEast.\" Waybroad has certainly wonderfully curative powers, especially\r\nfor bee-stings, but otherwise it has long since fallen from its high\r\nestate. Peony throughout the Middle Ages was held in high repute for\r\nits protective powers, and even during the closing years of the last\r\ncentury country folk hung beads made of its roots round children's\r\nnecks.[29] Yarrow is one of the aboriginal English plants, and from\r\ntime immemorial it has been used in incantations and by witches.\r\nCountry folk still regard it as one of our most valuable herbs,\r\nespecially for rheumatism. Mugwort, which was held in repute\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages for its efficacy against unseen powers of\r\nevil, is one of the nine sacred herbs in the alliterative lay in the\r\n_Lacnunga_, where it is described thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Eldest of worts\r\n    Thou hast might for three\r\n    And against thirty\r\n    For venom availest\r\n    For flying vile things,\r\n    Mighty against loathed ones\r\n    That through the land rove.\"\r\n\r\n                       Harleian MS. 585.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (1) ARTEMISIA AND (2) BLACKBERRY, FROM A SAXON HERBAL\r\n      (Sloane 1975, folio 37_a_)]\r\n\r\nWith the notable exception of vervain, it is curious how little\r\nprominence is given in Saxon plant lore to the herbs which were held\r\nmost sacred by the Druids, and yet it is scarcely credible that some\r\nof their wonderful lore should not have been assimilated. But in these\r\nmanuscripts little or no importance attaches to mistletoe, holly,\r\nbirch or ivy. There is no mention of mistletoe as a sacred herb.[30]\r\nWe find some mention of selago, generally identified with\r\n_lycopodium selago_, of which Pliny tells us vaguely that it was \"like\r\nsavin.\" The gathering of it had to be accompanied in Druid days with\r\nmystic ceremonies. The Druid had his feet bare and was clad in white,\r\nand the plant could not be cut with iron, nor touched with the naked\r\nhand. So great were its powers that it was called \"the gift of God.\"\r\nNor is there any mention in Saxon plant lore of the use of _sorbus\r\naucuparia_, which the Druids planted near their monolithic circles as\r\nprotection against unseen powers of darkness. There is, however, one\r\nprescription which may date back to the Roman occupation of Britain.\r\nIt runs thus: \"Take nettles, and seethe them in oil, smear and rub all\r\nthy body therewith; the cold will depart away.\"[31] It has always been\r\nbelieved that one of the varieties of nettle (_Urtica pilulifera_) was\r\nintroduced into England by the Roman soldiers, who brought the seed of\r\nit with them. According to the tradition, they were told that the cold\r\nin England was unendurable; so they brought these seeds in order to\r\nhave a plentiful supply of nettles wherewith to rub their bodies and\r\nthereby keep themselves warm. Possibly this prescription dates back to\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nFrom what hoary antiquity the charms and incantations which we find in\r\nthese manuscripts have come down to us we cannot say. Their atmosphere\r\nis that of palæolithic cave-drawings, for they are redolent of the\r\ncraft of sorcerers and they suggest those strange cave markings which\r\nno one can decipher. Who can say what lost languages are embedded in\r\nthese unintelligible words and single letters, or what is their\r\nmeaning? To what ancient ceremonies do they pertain, and who were the\r\ninitiated who alone understood them? At present it is all mysterious,\r\nthough perhaps one day we shall discover both their sources and their\r\nmeaning. They show no definite traces of the Scandinavian rune-lays\r\nconcerning herbs, though one of the charms is in runic characters. It\r\nis noteworthy that in the third book, which is evidently much older\r\nthan the first two parts of the _Leech Book_, the proportion of\r\nheathen charms is exceptionally large. In one prescription we find the\r\nnames of two heathen idols, Tiecon and Leleloth, combined with a later\r\nChristian interpolation of the names of the four gospellers. The charm\r\nis in runic characters and is to be followed by a prayer. Many of the\r\nmystic sentences are wholly incomprehensible, in others we find\r\nheathen names such as Lilumenne, in others a string of words which may\r\nbe a corrupt form of some very ancient language. Thus a lay to be sung\r\nin case a man or beast drinks an insect runs thus:--\"Gonomil, orgomil,\r\nmarbumil, marbsai, tofeth,\" etc.[32]\r\n\r\nIf some of the charms have a malignant sound, others were probably as\r\nsoothing in those days as those gems are still which have survived in\r\nour inimitable nursery rhymes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following has for us no meaning, but even in the\r\ntranslation it has something of the curious effect of the words in the\r\noriginal. A woman who cannot rear her child is instructed to\r\nsay--\"Everywhere I carried for me the famous kindred doughty one with\r\nthis famous meat doughty one, so I will have it for me and go home.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Lacnunga_ there is a counting-out charm which is a mixture of\r\nan ancient heathen charm combined with a Christian rite at the end.\r\n\r\n    \"Nine were Noddes sisters, then the nine came to be eight,\r\n    and the eight seven, and the seven six, and the six five,\r\n    and the five four, and the four three, and the three two,\r\n    and the two one, and the one none. This may be medicine for\r\n    thee from scrofula and from worm and from every mischief.\r\n    Sing also the Benedicite nine times.\"--_Lacnunga_, 95.[33]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable narrative charms is that for warts copied\r\nbelow from the _Lacnunga_. It is to be sung first into the left ear,\r\nthen into the right ear, then above the man's poll, then \"let one who\r\nis a maiden go to him and hang it upon his neck, do so for three days,\r\nit will soon be well with him.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Here came entering\r\n    A spider wight.\r\n    He had his hands upon his hams.\r\n    He quoth that thou his hackney wert.\r\n    Lay thee against his neck.\r\n    They began to sail off the land.\r\n    As soon as they off the land came, then began they to cool.\r\n    Then came in a wild beast's sister.\r\n          Then she ended\r\n    And oaths she swore that never could this harm the sick, nor him\r\n      who could get at this charm, nor him who had skill to sing this\r\n      charm. Amen. Fiat.\"--_Lacnunga_, 56.\r\n\r\nOf the world-wide custom of charming disease from the patient and\r\ntransferring it to some inanimate object we find numerous examples.\r\nThis custom is not only of very ancient origin, but persisted until\r\nrecent times even in this country. As commonly practised in\r\nout-of-the-way parts of Great Britain it was believed that the disease\r\ntransferred to an inanimate object would be contracted by the next\r\nperson who picked it up, but in the Saxon herbals we find an\r\napparently older custom of transferring the disease to \"running water\"\r\n(suggestive of the Israelitish scapegoat), and also that of throwing\r\nthe blood from the wound across the wagon way. These charms for\r\ntransferring disease seem originally to have been associated with a\r\nconsiderable amount of ceremonial. For instance, in those to cure the\r\nbite of a hunting spider we find that a certain number of\r\nscarifications are to be struck (and in both cases an odd\r\nnumber--three and five); in the case of the five scarifications, \"one\r\non the bite and four round about it,\" the blood is to be caught in \"a\r\ngreen spoon of hazel-wood,\" and the blood is to be thrown \"in silence\"\r\nover a wagon way. In the _Lacnunga_ there are traces of the actual\r\nceremonial of transferring the disease, and the Christian prayer has\r\nobviously been substituted for an older heathen one. The charm is in\r\nunintelligible words and is followed by the instruction, \"Sing this\r\nnine times and the Pater Noster nine times over a barley loaf and give\r\nit to the horse to eat.\" In a \"salve against the elfin race\" it is\r\nnoticeable that the herbs, after elaborate preparation, are not\r\nadministered to the patient at all, but are thrown into running water.\r\n\r\n    \"A salve against the elfin race and nocturnal goblin\r\n    visitors: take wormwood, lupin.... Put these worts into a\r\n    vessel, set them under the altar, sing over them nine\r\n    masses, boil them in butter and sheep's grease, add much\r\n    holy salt, strain through a cloth, throw the worts into\r\n    running water.\"--_Leech Book_, III. 61.\r\n\r\nOne charm in the _Lacnunga_ which is perhaps not too long to quote\r\nspeaks of some long-lost tale. It appears to be a fragment of a\r\npopular lay, and one wonders how many countless generations of our\r\nancestors sang it, and what it commemorates:--\r\n\r\n    \"Loud were they loud,      as over the land they rode,\r\n    Fierce of heart were they,      as over the hill they rode.\r\n    Shield thee now thyself;      from this spite thou mayst escape thee!\r\n    Out little spear      if herein thou be!\r\n    Underneath the linden stood he,      underneath the shining shield,\r\n    While the mighty women      mustered up their strength;\r\n    And the spears they send      screaming through the air!\r\n    Back again to them      will I send another.\r\n    Arrow forth a-flying      from the front against them;\r\n    Out little spear      if herein thou be!\r\n    Sat the smith thereat,      smoke a little seax out.\r\n    Out little spear      if herein thou be!\r\n    Six the smiths that sat there--      making slaughter-spears:\r\n    Out little spear,      in be not spear!\r\n    If herein there hide      flake of iron hard,\r\n    Of a witch the work,      it shall melt away.\r\n    Wert thou shot into the skin,      or shot into the flesh,\r\n    Wert thou shot into the blood,      or shot into the bone,\r\n    Wert thou shot into the limb--      never more thy life be teased!\r\n    If it were the shot of Esa,      or it were of elves the shot\r\n    Or it were of hags the shot;      help I bring to thee.\r\n    This to boot for Esa-shot,      this to boot for elfin-shot.\r\n    This to boot for shot of hags!      Help I bring to thee.\r\n    Flee witch to the wild hill top      ... ...\r\n    But thou--be thou hale,      and help thee the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nWho were these six smiths and who were the witches? One thinks of that\r\nmighty Smith Weyland in the palace of Nidad king of the Niars, of the\r\nqueen's fear of his flashing eyes and the maiming of him by her cruel\r\norders, and of the cups he made from the skulls of her sons and gems\r\nfrom their eyes. We think of these as old tales, but instinct tells us\r\nthat they are horribly real. We may not know how that semi-divine\r\nsmith made himself wings, but that he flew over the palace and never\r\nreturned we do not doubt for an instant. To the fairy stories which\r\nembody such myths children of unnumbered generations have listened,\r\nand they demand them over and over again because they, too, are sure\r\nthat they are real.\r\n\r\nNor is the mystery of numbers lacking in these herbal prescriptions,\r\nparticularly the numbers three and nine. In the alliterative lay of\r\nthe nine healing herbs this is very conspicuous. Woden, we are told,\r\nsmote the serpent with nine magic twigs, the serpent was broken into\r\nnine parts, from which the wind blew the nine flying venoms. There are\r\nnumerous instances of the patient being directed to take nine of each\r\nof the ingredients or to take the herb potion itself for three or nine\r\ndays. Or it is directed that an incantation is to be said or sung\r\nthree or nine times, or that three or nine masses are to be sung over\r\nthe herbs. This mystic use of three and nine is conspicuous in the\r\nfollowing prescription:--\r\n\r\n    \"Against dysentery, a bramble of which both ends are in the\r\n    earth take the newer root, delve it up, cut up nine chips\r\n    with the left hand and sing three times the Miserere mei\r\n    Deus and nine times the Pater Noster, then take mugwort and\r\n    everlasting, boil these three worts and the chips in milk\r\n    till they get red, then let the man sip at night fasting a\r\n    pound dish full ... let him rest himself soft and wrap\r\n    himself up warm; if more need be let him do so again, if\r\n    thou still need do it a third time, thou wilt not need\r\n    oftener.\"--_Leech Book_, II. 65.\r\n\r\nThe leechdom for the use of dwarf elder against a snake-bite runs\r\nthus:--[34]\r\n\r\n    \"For rent by snake take this wort and ere thou carve it off\r\n    hold it in thine hand and say thrice nine times Omnes malas\r\n    bestias canto, that is in our language Enchant and overcome\r\n    all evil wild deer; then carve it off with a very sharp\r\n    knife into three parts.\"--_Herb. Ap._, 93.\r\n\r\nSome of the most remarkable passages in the manuscripts are those\r\nconcerning the ceremonies to be observed both in the picking and in\r\nthe administering of herbs. What the mystery of plant life which has\r\nso deeply affected the minds of men in all ages and of all\r\ncivilisations meant to our ancestors, we can but dimly apprehend as we\r\nstudy these ceremonies. They carry us back to that worship of earth\r\nand the forces of Nature which prevailed when Woden was yet unborn.\r\nThat Woden was the chief god of the tribes on the mainland is\r\nindisputable, but even in the hierarchy of ancestors reverenced as\r\nsemi-divine the Saxons themselves looked to Sceaf rather than to\r\nWoden, who himself was descended from Sceaf. There are few more\r\nhaunting legends than that of our mystic forefather, the little boy\r\nasleep on a sheaf of corn who, in a richly adorned vessel which moved\r\nneither by sails nor oars, came to our people out of the great deep\r\nand was hailed by them as their king. Did not Alfred himself claim him\r\nas his primeval progenitor, the founder of our race? There is no\r\ntangible link between his descendant Woden and the worship of earth,\r\nbut the sheaf of corn, the symbol of Sceaf, carries us straight back\r\nto Nature worship. Sceaf takes his fitting place as the semi-divine\r\nancestor with the lesser divinities such as Hrede and Eostra, goddess\r\nof the radiant dawn. It is to this age that the ceremonies in the\r\npicking of the herbs transport us, to the mystery of the virtues of\r\nherbs, the fertility of earth, the never-ceasing conflict between the\r\nbeneficent forces of sun and summer and the evil powers of the long,\r\ndark northern winters. Closely intertwined with Nature worship we find\r\nthe later Christian rites and ceremonies. For the new teaching did not\r\noust the old, and for many centuries the mind of the average man\r\nhalted half-way between the two faiths. If he accepted Christ he did\r\nnot cease to fear the great hierarchy of unseen powers of Nature, the\r\nworship of which was bred in his very bone. The ancient festivals of\r\nYule and Eostra continued under another guise and polytheism still\r\nheld its sway. The devil became one with the gloomy and terrible in\r\nNature, with the malignant elves and dwarfs. Even with the warfare\r\nbetween the beneficent powers of sun and the fertility of Nature and\r\nthe malignant powers of winter, the devil became associated. Nor did\r\nmen cease to believe in the Wyrd, that dark, ultimate fate goddess\r\nwho, though obscure, lies at the back of all Saxon belief. It was in\r\nvain that the Church preached against superstitions. Egbert,\r\nArchbishop of York, in his Penitential, strictly forbade the gathering\r\nof herbs with incantations and enjoined the use of Christian rites,\r\nbut it is probable that even when these manuscripts were written, the\r\nmajority at least of the common folk in these islands, though\r\nnominally Christian, had not deserted their ancient ways of\r\nthought.[35] When the Saxon peasant went to gather his healing herbs\r\nhe may have used Christian prayers[36] and ceremonies, but he did not\r\nforget the goddess of the dawn. It is noteworthy how frequently we\r\nfind the injunction that the herbs must be picked at sunrise or when\r\nday and night divide, how often stress is laid upon looking towards\r\nthe east, and turning \"as the sun goeth from east to south and west.\"\r\nIn many there is the instruction that the herb is to be gathered\r\n\"without use of iron\" or \"with gold and with hart's horn\" (emblems of\r\nthe sun's rays). It is curious how little there is of moon lore. In\r\nsome cases the herbs are to be gathered in silence, in others the man\r\nwho gathers them is not to look behind him--a prohibition which occurs\r\nfrequently in ancient superstitions. The ceremonies are all mysterious\r\nand suggestive, but behind them always lies the ancient ineradicable\r\nworship of Nature. To what dim past does that cry, \"Erce, Erce, Erce,\r\nMother of Earth\" carry us?\r\n\r\n    \"Erce, Erce, Erce,      Mother of Earth!\r\n    May the All-Wielder,      Ever Lord grant thee\r\n    Acres a-waxing,      upwards a-growing\r\n    Pregnant [with corn]      and plenteous in strength;\r\n    Hosts of [grain] shafts      and of glittering plants!\r\n    Of broad barley      the blossoms\r\n    And of white wheat      ears waxing,\r\n    Of the whole earth      the harvest!\r\n    Let be guarded the grain      against all the ills\r\n    That are sown o'er the land      by the sorcery men,\r\n    Nor let cunning women change it      nor a crafty man.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that other ancient verse:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hail be thou, Earth,      Mother of men!\r\n    In the lap of the God      be thou a-growing!\r\n    Be filled with fodder      for fare-need of men!\"\r\n\r\nIt is of these two invocations that Stopford Brooke (whose\r\ntranslations I have used) writes: \"These are very old heathen\r\ninvocations used, I daresay, from century to century and from far\r\nprehistoric times by all the Teutonic farmers. Who 'Erce' is remains\r\nobscure. But the Mother of Earth seems to be here meant, and she is a\r\nperson who greatly kindles our curiosity. To touch her is like\r\ntouching empty space, so far away is she. At any rate some Godhead or\r\nother seems here set forth under her proper name. In the Northern\r\nCosmogony, Night is the Mother of Earth. But Erce cannot be Night. She\r\nis (if Erce be a proper name) bound up with agriculture. Grimm\r\nsuggests Eorce, connected with the Old High German 'erchan' = simplex.\r\nHe also makes a bold guess that she may be the same as a divine dame\r\nin Low Saxon districts called Herke or Harke, who dispenses earthly\r\ngoods in abundance, and acts in the same way as Berhta and Holda--an\r\nearth-goddess, the lady of the plougher and sower and reaper. In the\r\nMark she is called Frau Harke. Montanus draws attention to the\r\nappearance of this charm in a convent at Corvei, in which this line\r\nbegins--'Eostar, Eostar, eordhan modor.' ... The name remains\r\nmysterious. The song breathes the pleasure and worship of ancient\r\ntillers of the soil in the labours of the earth and in the goods the\r\nmother gave. It has grown, it seems, out of the breast of earth\r\nherself; earth is here the Mother of Men. The surface of earth is the\r\nlap of the Goddess; in her womb let all growth be plentiful. Food is\r\nin her for the needs of men. 'Hail be thou, Earth!' I daresay this\r\nhymn was sung ten thousand years ago by the early Aryans on the Baltic\r\ncoast.\"\r\n\r\nEven in a twelfth-century herbal we find a prayer to Earth, and it is\r\nso beautiful that I close this chapter with it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Earth,[37] divine goddess, Mother Nature who generatest all\r\n    things and bringest forth anew the sun which thou hast given\r\n    to the nations; Guardian of sky and sea and of all gods and\r\n    powers and through thy power all nature falls silent and\r\n    then sinks in sleep. And again thou bringest back the light\r\n    and chasest away night and yet again thou coverest us most\r\n    securely with thy shades. Thou dost contain chaos infinite,\r\n    yea and winds and showers and storms; thou sendest them out\r\n    when thou wilt and causest the seas to roar; thou chasest\r\n    away the sun and arousest the storm. Again when thou wilt\r\n    thou sendest forth the joyous day and givest the nourishment\r\n    of life with thy eternal surety; and when the soul departs\r\n    to thee we return. Thou indeed art duly called great Mother\r\n    of the gods; thou conquerest by thy divine name. Thou art\r\n    the source of the strength of nations and of gods, without\r\n    thee nothing can be brought to perfection or be born; thou\r\n    art great queen of the gods. Goddess! I adore thee as\r\n    divine; I call upon thy name; be pleased to grant that which\r\n    I ask thee, so shall I give thanks to thee, goddess, with\r\n    one faith.\r\n\r\n    \"Hear, I beseech thee, and be favourable to my prayer.\r\n    Whatsoever herb thy power dost produce, give, I pray, with\r\n    goodwill to all nations to save them and grant me this my\r\n    medicine. Come to me with thy powers, and howsoever I may\r\n    use them may they have good success and to whomsoever I may\r\n    give them. Whatever thou dost grant it may prosper. To thee\r\n    all things return. Those who rightly receive these herbs\r\n    from me, do thou make them whole. Goddess, I beseech thee;\r\n    I pray thee as a suppliant that by thy majesty thou grant\r\n    this to me.\r\n\r\n    \"Now I make intercession to you all ye powers and herbs and\r\n    to your majesty, ye whom Earth parent of all hath produced\r\n    and given as a medicine of health to all nations and hath\r\n    put majesty upon you, be, I pray you, the greatest help to\r\n    the human race. This I pray and beseech from you, and be\r\n    present here with your virtues, for she who created you hath\r\n    herself promised that I may gather you into the goodwill of\r\n    him on whom the art of medicine was bestowed, and grant for\r\n    health's sake good medicine by grace of your powers. I pray\r\n    grant me through your virtues that whatsoe'er is wrought by\r\n    me through you may in all its powers have a good and speedy\r\n    effect and good success and that I may always be permitted\r\n    with the favour of your majesty to gather you into my hands\r\n    and to glean your fruits. So shall I give thanks to you in\r\n    the name of that majesty which ordained your birth.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FROM A SAXON HERBAL\r\n      (Harl. 1585, folio 19_a_)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Nec non et si quos sæcularis scientiæ libros nobis ignotos\r\nadepturi sitis, ut sunt de medicinalibus, quorum copia est aliqua apud\r\nnos, sed tamen segmenta ultra marina quæ in eis scripta comperimus,\r\nignota nobis sunt et difficilia ad adipiscendum.--Bonifac.,\r\n_Epistolæ_, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[3] A catalogue of the books of that foundation cited by Wanley\r\n(Hickes, _Thesaur._ Vol. II.

It is interesting to find this\r\nillustration of Asser's statement, that he had seen and read the\r\nletters which the Patriarch of Jerusalem sent with presents to the\r\nking. From Asser also we learn that King Alfred kept a book in which\r\nhe himself entered \"little flowers culled on every side from all sorts\r\nof masters.\" \"Flosculos undecunque collectos a quibus libet magistris\r\net in corpore unius libelli mixtim quamvis sicut tunc suppetebat\r\nredigere.\"--ASSER, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[5] The stories of miraculous cures by famous Anglo-Saxon bishops and\r\nabbots are for the most part too well known to be worth quoting, but\r\nthe unfair treatment of the leech is perhaps nowhere more clearly\r\nshown than in Bede's tale of St. John of Beverley curing a boy with a\r\ndiseased head. Although the leech effected the cure, the success was\r\nattributed to the bishop's benediction, and the story ends, \"the youth\r\nbecame of a clear countenance, ready in speech and with hair\r\nbeautifully wavy.\"\r\n\r\n[6] A small but striking instance of Saxon knowledge, or rather close\r\nobservation, of plants is to be found in the following description of\r\nwolf's teazle in the _Herbarium of Apuleius_:--\"This wort hath leaves\r\nreversed and thorny and it hath in its midst a round and thorny knob,\r\nand that is brown-headed in the blossoms and hath white seed and a\r\nwhite and very fragrant root.\" The word \"reversed\" is not in the\r\noriginal and was therefore added by the Saxon translator, who had\r\nobserved the fact that all the thistle tribe protect their leaves by\r\nthorns pointing backwards as well as forwards.\r\n\r\n[7] It is interesting to remember that even as late as the sixteenth\r\ncentury plantain was called \"waybroad.\" See _Turner's Herbal_.\r\n\r\n[8] There are numerous Latin MSS. of this book, chiefly in Italian\r\nlibraries, several being in the Laurentian Library at Florence. The\r\nbook was first printed at Rome, probably soon after 1480, by Joh.\r\nPhilippus de Lignamine, who was also the editor. De Lignamine, who was\r\nphysician to Pope Sixtus IV., says that he found this MS. in the\r\nlibrary of the monastery of Monte Cassino. In the first impression the\r\nbook is dedicated to Cardinal de Gonzaga; in the second impression to\r\nCardinal de Ruvere. (The copy in the British Museum is of the second\r\nimpression.) In this small quarto volume the illustrations are rough\r\ncuts. It is interesting to remember that these are the earliest known\r\nprinted figures of plants. The printed text contains a large number of\r\nGreek and Latin synonyms which do not appear in the Saxon translation.\r\nSubsequent editions were printed in 1528 (Paris) and in the Aldine\r\nCollection of Latin medical writers, 1547 (Venice).\r\n\r\n[9] Cratevas is said to have lived in the first century B.C.

Like all these cheerful\r\nSaxon prescriptions, this one ends with the comforting assurance \"it\r\nwill soon be well with him,\" and one wonders whether in this, as in\r\nmany other cases, the patient got well in order to avoid his friends'\r\nministrations. The prescription for a vapour bath made with herbs runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"Take bramble rind and elm rind, ash rind, sloethorn, rind of apple\r\ntree and ivy, all these from the nether part of the trees, and\r\ncucumber, smear wort, everfern, helenium, enchanters nightshade,\r\nbetony, marrubium, radish, agrimony. Scrape the worts into a kettle\r\nand boil strongly. When it hath strongly boiled remove it off the fire\r\nand seat the man over it and wrap the man up that the vapour may get\r\nup nowhere, except only that the man may breathe; beathe him with\r\nthese fomentations as long as he can bear it. Then have another bath\r\nready for him, take an emmet bed all at once, a bed of those male\r\nemmets which at whiles fly, they are red ones, boil them in water,\r\nbeathe him with it immoderately hot. Then make him a salve. Take worts\r\nof each kind of those above mentioned, boil them in butter, smear the\r\nsore limbs, they will soon quicken.

She appears to have been of a\r\nsour and somewhat hysterical temperament, and three of the village\r\ngossips came to the conclusion that she was a victim of diabolical\r\npossession and resolved to effect a cure by means of enchantment. They\r\nfirst of all gathered the herbs needed for the purpose in the forest\r\nat the proper conjunction of the stars. Then a tripod was formed of\r\nthree chairs, and to these the patient was bound. Beneath her was\r\nfixed a pail of red-hot coal on which the herbs were scattered. As the\r\nfumes of the burning weeds veiled the victim the three neighbours\r\ncrooned the prescribed exorcism. The louder the woman shrieked the\r\nlouder they sang, and after the process had been continued long enough\r\nto prove effective, in their opinion, they ran away, believing that\r\nthe devil would run out of the woman after them. She, however,\r\ncontinued to shriek. Her cries were heard by a man, who released\r\nher.--_The Times_, December 5, 1921.\r\n\r\n[27] It is interesting to find the same beliefs amongst the ancient\r\nBabylonians.\r\n\r\n    \"Fleabane on the lintel of the door I have hung\r\n    S.

There are, it is true, two famous mistletoe pears in this\r\ncountry--one in the garden of Belvoir Castle and the other in the\r\ngarden of Fern Lodge, Malvern, but in both cases the seed was sown\r\nnaturally. It grows very rarely on the oak, and this possibly accounts\r\nfor the special reverence accorded by the Druids to the mistletoe oak.\r\n\r\n[31] _Leech Book_, I. 81.\r\n\r\n[32] _Lacnunga_, 9.\r\n\r\n[33] This closely resembles a Cornish charm for a tetter.\r\n\r\n    \"Tetter, tetter, thou hast nine brothers,\r\n    God bless the flesh and preserve the bone;\r\n    Perish thou, tetter, and be thou gone.\r\n    Tetter, tetter, thou hast eight brothers.\"\r\n\r\nThus the verses are continued until tetter having \"no brother\" is\r\nordered to be gone.--R.

After the Norman Conquest the old Anglo-Saxon lore\r\nnaturally fell into disrepute, although the Normans were inferior to\r\nthe Saxons in their knowledge of herbs. The learned books of the\r\nconquerors were written exclusively in Latin, and it is sad to think\r\nof the number of beautiful Saxon books which must have been destroyed,\r\nfor when the Saxons were turned out of their own monasteries the\r\nNormans who supplanted them probably regarded books written in a\r\nlanguage they did not understand as mere rubbish. Much of the old\r\nSaxon herb lore is to be found in the leech books of the Middle Ages,\r\nbut, with one notable exception, no important original treatise on\r\nherbs by an English writer has come down to us from that period. The\r\nvast majority of the herbal MSS. are merely transcriptions of Macer's\r\nherbal, a mediæval Latin poem on the virtues of seventy-seven plants,\r\nwhich is believed to have been written in the tenth century. The\r\npopularity of this poem is shown by the number of MSS. still extant.\r\nIt was translated into English as early as the twelfth century with\r\nthe addition of \"A fewe herbes wyche Macer tretyth not.\"[38] In 1373\r\nit was translated by John Lelamoure, a schoolmaster of Hertford. On\r\nfolio 55 of the MS. of this translation is the inscription, \"God\r\ngracious of grauntis havythe yyeue and ygrauted vertuys in woodys\r\nstonys and herbes of the whiche erbis Macer the philosofure made a\r\nboke in Latyne the whiche boke Johannes Lelamoure scolemaistre of\r\nHerforde est, they he unworthy was in the yere of oure Lorde a. m.\r\nccc. lxxiij tournyd in to Ynglis.\" Macer's herbal is also the basis of\r\na treatise in rhyme of which there are several copies in England and\r\none in the Royal Library at Stockholm. This treatise, which deals with\r\ntwenty-four herbs, begins thus quaintly--\r\n\r\n    \"Of erbs xxiiij I woll you tell by and by\r\n    Als I fond wryten in a boke at I in boroyng toke\r\n    Of a gret ladys preste of gret name she barest.\"\r\n\r\nThe poem begins with a description of betony, powerful against \"wykked\r\nsperytis,\" and then treats, amongst other herbs, of the virtues of\r\ncentaury, marigold, celandine, pimpernel, motherwort, vervain,\r\nperiwinkle, rose, lily, henbane, agrimony, sage, rue, fennel and\r\nviolet. It is pleasant to find the belief that only to look on\r\nmarigolds will draw evil humours out of the head and strengthen the\r\neyesight.\r\n\r\n    \"Golde [marigold] is bitter in savour\r\n    Fayr and [gh]elw [yellow] is his flowur\r\n    Ye golde flour is good to sene\r\n    It makyth ye syth bryth and clene\r\n    Wyscely to lokyn on his flowris\r\n    Drawyth owt of ye heed wikked hirores [humours].\r\n    .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n    Loke wyscely on golde erly at morwe [morning]\r\n    Yat day fro feueres it schall ye borwe:\r\n    Ye odour of ye golde is good to smelle.\"\r\n\r\nThe instructions for the picking of this joyous flower are given at\r\nlength. It must be taken only when the moon is in the sign of the\r\nVirgin, and not when Jupiter is in the ascendant, for then the herb\r\nloses its virtue. And the gatherer, who must be out of deadly sin,\r\nmust say three Pater Nosters and three Aves. Amongst its many virtues\r\nwe find that it gives the wearer a vision of anyone who has robbed\r\nhim. The virtues of vervain also are many; it must be picked \"at\r\nSpring of day\" in \"ye monyth of May.\" Periwinkle is given its\r\nbeautiful old name \"joy of the ground\" (\"men calle it ye Juy of\r\nGrownde\") and the description runs thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Parwynke is an erbe grene of colour\r\n    In tyme of May he beryth blo flour,\r\n    His stalkys ain [are] so feynt [weak] and feye\r\n    Yet never more growyth he heye [high].\"\r\n\r\nUnder sage we find the old proverb--\"How can a man die who has sage in\r\nhis garden?\"\r\n\r\n    \"Why of seknesse deyeth man\r\n    Whill sawge [sage] in gardeyn he may han.\"\r\n\r\nA manuscript of exceptional interest is one describing the virtues of\r\nrosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to her daughter\r\nPhilippa, Queen of England, and apart from its intrinsic interest it\r\nis important from the fact that it is obviously the original of the\r\nvery poetical discourse on rosemary in the first printed English\r\nherbal, commonly known as Banckes's herbal. Moreover, in this MS.\r\nthere is recorded an old tradition which I have not found in any other\r\nherbal, but which is still current amongst old-fashioned country folk,\r\nnamely, that rosemary \"passeth not commonly in highte the highte of\r\nCriste whill he was man on Erthe,\" and that when the plant attains the\r\nage of thirty-three years it will increase in breadth but not in\r\nheight. It is the oldest MS. in which we find many other beliefs about\r\nrosemary that still survive in England. There is a tradition that\r\nQueen Philippa's mother sent the first plants of rosemary to England,\r\nand in a copy of this MS. in the library of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, the translator, \"danyel bain,\" says that rosemary was\r\nunknown in England until the Countess of Hainault sent some to her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThe only original treatise on herbs written by an Englishman during\r\nthe Middle Ages was that by Bartholomæus Anglicus, and on the\r\nplant-lover there are probably few of the mediæval writers who\r\nexercise so potent a spell. Even in the thirteenth century, that age\r\nof great men, Bartholomew the Englishman ranked with thinkers such as\r\nRoger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. He was accounted one\r\nof the greatest theologians of his day, and if his lectures on\r\ntheology were as simple as his writings on herbs, it is easy to\r\nunderstand why they were thronged and why his writings were so eagerly\r\nstudied, not only in his lifetime but for nearly three centuries\r\nafterwards. A child could understand his book on herbs, for, being\r\ngreat, he was simple. But although his work _De Proprietatibus Rerum_\r\n(which contains nineteen books) was the source of common information\r\non Natural History throughout the Middle Ages, and was one of the\r\nbooks hired out at a regulated price by the scholars of Paris, we know\r\nvery little of the writer. He spent the greater part of his life in\r\nFrance and Saxony, but he was English born and was always known as\r\nBartholomæus Anglicus.[39] We know that he studied in Paris and\r\nentered the French province of the Minorite Order, and later he became\r\none of the most renowned professors of theology in Paris. In 1230 a\r\nletter was received from the general of the Friars Minor in the new\r\nprovince of Saxony asking the provincial of France to send Bartholomew\r\nand another Englishman to help in the work of that province, and the\r\nformer subsequently went there. We do not know the exact date of _De\r\nProprietatibus Rerum_, but it must have been written about the middle\r\nof the thirteenth century; for, though it cites Albertus Magnus, who\r\nwas teaching in Paris in 1248, there is no mention of any of the later\r\nauthorities, such as Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon and Vincent de\r\nBeauvais. It was certainly known in England as early as 1296, for\r\nthere is a copy of that date at Oxford, and there still exist both in\r\nFrance and in England a considerable number of other manuscript\r\ncopies, most of which date from the latter part of the thirteenth\r\ncentury and the early part of the fourteenth. The book was translated\r\ninto English in 1398 by John de Trevisa,[40] chaplain to Lord Berkeley\r\nand vicar of Berkeley, and Bartholomew could scarcely have been more\r\nfortunate in his translator. At the end of his translation, Trevisa\r\nwrites thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Endlesse grace blysse thankyng and praysyng unto our Lorde\r\n    God Omnipotent be gyuen, by whoos ayde and helpe this\r\n    translacon was endyd at Berkeleye the syxte daye of Feuerer\r\n    the yere of our Lorde MCCCLXXXXVIII the yere of y{e} reyne\r\n    of Kynge Rycharde the seconde after the Conqueste of\r\n    Englonde XXII. The yere of my lordes aege, syre Thomas,\r\n    Lorde of Berkeleye that made me to make this Translac[=o]n\r\n    XLVII.\"\r\n\r\nSalimbene shows that the book was known in Italy in 1283, and there\r\nare two MS. copies in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, of which\r\nthe earliest is dated 1297. Before Trevisa made his English\r\ntranslation, it had been translated into French by Jehan Corbichon, in\r\n1372, for Charles V. of France.\r\n\r\nThe book was first printed at Basle about 1470, and the esteem in\r\nwhich it was held may be judged from the fact that it went through at\r\nleast fourteen editions before 1500, and besides the English and\r\nFrench translations it was also translated into Spanish and Dutch. The\r\nEnglish translation was first printed by Caxton's famous apprentice,\r\nWynken de Worde.[41] The translator in a naïve little introductory\r\npoem says that, just as he had looked as a child to God to help him in\r\nhis games, so now he prays Him to help him in this book.\r\n\r\n    \"C[?]Rosse was made all of red .\r\n    In the begynning of my boke .\r\n    That is called, god me sped .\r\n    In the fyrste lesson that j toke .\r\n    Thenne I learned a and b .\r\n    And other letters by her names .\r\n    But alway God spede me .\r\n    Thought me nedefull in all games .\r\n    Yf I played in felde, other medes .\r\n    Stylle other wyth noyse .\r\n    I prayed help in all my dedes .\r\n    Of him that deyed upon the croys .\r\n    Now dyuerse playes in his name .\r\n    I shall lette passe forth and far .\r\n    And aventure to play so long game .\r\n    Also I shall spare .\r\n    Wodes, medes and feldes .\r\n    Place that I have played inne .\r\n    And in his name that all th[=i]g weldes .\r\n    This game j shall begynne. .\r\n    And praye helpe conseyle and rede .\r\n    To me that he wolde sende .\r\n    And this game rule and lede .\r\n    And brynge it to a good ende. .\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the preface Trevisa addresses his readers thus: \"Merveyle not,\r\nye witty and eloquent reders, that I th[=y]ne of wytte and voyde of\r\ncunning have translatid this boke from latin to our vulgayre language\r\nas a thynge profitable to me and peradventure to many other, whych\r\nunderstonde not latyn nor have not the knowledge of the proprytees of\r\nthynges.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth book of _De Proprietatibus Rerum_ is on herbs and\r\ntheir uses, and it is full of allusions to the classical writers on\r\nherbs--Aristotle, Dioscorides and Galen--but the descriptions of the\r\nplants themselves are original and charming.\r\n\r\nThere is no record to show that Bartholomew the Englishman was a\r\ngardener, but we can hardly doubt that the man who described flowers\r\nwith such loving care possessed a garden and worked in it. The\r\n_Herbarius zu Teutsch_ might have been written in a study, but there\r\nis fresh air and the beauty of the living flowers in Bartholomew's\r\nwritings. Of the lily he says: \"The Lely is an herbe wyth a whyte\r\nfloure. And though the levys of the floure be whyte yet wythen shyneth\r\nthe lyknesse of golde.\" Bartholomew may have known nothing of the\r\nmodern science of botany, but he knew how to describe not only the\r\nlily, but also the atmosphere of the lily, in a word-picture of\r\ninimitable simplicity and beauty. One feels instinctively that only a\r\nchild or a great man could have written those lines. And is there not\r\nsomething unforgettable in these few words on the unfolding of a\r\nrose--\"And wh[=a]ne they [the petals] ben full growen they sprede\r\ntheymselues ayenst the sonne rysynge\"?\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the rose is longer than most, and is so delightful that\r\nI quote a considerable part of it. \"The rose of gardens is planted and\r\nsette and tylthed as a vyne. And if it is forgendred and not shred and\r\npared and not clensed of superfluyte: th[=e]ne it gooth out of kynde\r\nand chaungeth in to a wylde rose. And by oft chaunging and tylthing\r\nthe wylde rose torneth and cha[=u]gith into a very rose. And the rose\r\nof ye garden and the wylde rose ben dyuers in multitude of floures:\r\nsmelle and colour: and also in vertue. For the leves of the wylde rose\r\nben fewe and brode and whytyssh: meddlyd wyth lytyll rednesse: and\r\nsmellyth not so wel as the tame rose, nother is so vertuous in\r\nmedicyn. The tame rose hath many leuys sette nye togyder: and ben all\r\nred, other almost white: w{t} wonder good smell.... And the more they\r\nben brused and broken: the vertuo[=u]ser they ben and the better\r\nsmellynge. And springeth out of a thorne that is harde and rough:\r\nnetheles the Rose folowyth not the kynde of the thorne: But she\r\narayeth her thorn wyth fayr colour and good smell. Whan ye rose\r\nbegynneth to sprynge it is closed in a knoppe wyth grenes: and that\r\nknoppe is grene. And wha[=n]e it swellyth thenne spryngeth out harde\r\nleuys and sharpe.... And wh[=a]ne they ben full growen they sprede\r\ntheymselues ayenst the sonne rysynge. And for they ben tendre and\r\nfeble to holde togyder in the begynnynge; theyfore about those smale\r\ngrene leuys ben nyghe the red and tendre leuys ... and ben sette all\r\naboute. And in the mydill thereof is seen the sede small and yellow\r\nwyth full gode smell.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOODCUT OF TREES AND HERBS FROM THE SEVENTEENTH\r\n      BOOK OF \"DE PROPRIETATIBUS RERUM\"\r\n      Printed by Wynkyn de Worde (1495)]\r\n\r\nThere follows a description, too long to quote here, of the growth of\r\nthe rose hip, which ends with the remark: \"But they ben not ful good\r\nto ete for roughnesse that is hyd wythin. And greuyth [grieveth]\r\nwythin his throte that ete thereof.\" ... \"Among all floures of the\r\nworlde,\" he continues, \"the floure of the rose is cheyf and beeryth ye\r\npryse. And by cause of vertues and swete smelle and savour. For by\r\nfayrnesse they fede the syghte: and playseth the smelle by odour, the\r\ntouche by softe handlynge. And wythstondeth and socouryth by vertue\r\nayenst many syknesses and euylles.\" A delicious recipe is given for\r\nRose honey. \"Rose shreede smalle and sod in hony makyth that hony\r\nmedycynable wyth gode smelle: And this comfortyeth and clenseth and\r\ndefyeth gleymy humours.\"\r\n\r\nOf the violet we read: \"Violet is a lytyll herbe in substaunce and is\r\nbetter fresshe and newe than whan it is olde. And the floure thereof\r\nsmellyth moost.... And the more vertuous the floure thereof is, ye\r\nmore it bendyth the heed thereof do[=u]warde. Also floures of\r\nspryngynge tyme spryngeth fyrste and sheweth somer. The lytylnes\r\nthereof in substaunce is nobly rewarded in gretnesse of sauour and of\r\nvertue.\"\r\n\r\nBartholomew's descriptions of flowers are usually brief, and there is\r\na clarity and vividness about them which give them a charm peculiarly\r\ntheir own. How fresh and English, for instance, is his chapter on the\r\napple. I have never before seen the taste of an apple described as\r\n\"merry,\" but how true the description is! \"Malus the Appyll tree is a\r\ntree yt bereth apples and is a grete tree in itself ... it is more\r\nshort than other trees of the wood wyth knottes and rinelyd Rynde.\r\nAnd makyth shadowe wythe thycke bowes and braunches: and fayr with\r\ndyuers blossomes, and floures of swetnesse and lykynge: with goode\r\nfruyte and noble. And is gracious in syght and in taste and vertuous\r\nin medecyne ... some beryth sourysh fruyte and harde and some ryght\r\nsoure and some ryght swete, with a good savoure and mery.\" The\r\ndescriptions of celandine and broom are also characteristic.\r\n\"Celidonia is an herbe w{t} yelowe floures, the frute smorcheth them\r\nthat it towchyth. And hyghte Celidonia for it spryngeth, other\r\nblomyth, in the comynge of swalowes.... It hy[gh]t celidonia for it\r\nhelpith swallowes birdes yf their eyen be hurte other (or) blynde.\"\r\n\"Genesta hath that name of bytterness for it is full of bytter to\r\nmannes taste. And is a shrubbe that growyth in a place that is\r\nforsaken, stony and untylthed. Presence thereof is wytnesse that the\r\ngrounde is bareyne and drye that it groweth in. And hath many\r\nbraunches knotty and hard. Grene in wynter and yelowe floures in somer\r\nthyche [the which] wrapped with heuy smell and bitter sauour. And ben\r\nnetheles moost of vertue.\" Bartholomew gives the old mandrake legend\r\nin full, though he adds, \"it is so feynd of churles others of\r\nwytches,\" and he also writes of its use as an anæsthetic.[42] Further,\r\nhe records two other beliefs about the mandrake which I have never\r\nfound in any other English herbal--namely, that while uprooting it one\r\nmust beware of contrary winds, and that one must go on digging for it\r\nuntil sunset. \"They that dygge mandragora be besy to beware of\r\ncontrary wyndes whyle they digge. And maken circles abowte with a\r\nswerder and abyde with the dyggynge unto the sonne goynge downe.\"\r\n\r\nBut apart from herbs and their uses, the book _De herbis_ is full of\r\nfleeting yet vigorous pictures of the homely everyday side of mediæval\r\nlife. Bartholomew, being one of the greatest men of his century,\r\nwrites of matters in which the simplest of us are interested. He\r\ntells us of the feeding of swine with acorns. Of the making and baking\r\nof bread (including the thrifty custom of mixing cooked beans with the\r\nflour \"to make the brede the more hevy\"). Incidentally, and with all\r\ndue respect, it may be remarked that he had no practical knowledge of\r\nthis subject, his vivid description being obviously that of an\r\ninterested spectator. There is an airy masculine vagueness about the\r\nconclusion of the whole matter of bread-making--\"and at last after\r\nmany travailes, man's lyfe is fedde and sustained therewith.\" He tells\r\nus of the use of laurel leaves to heal bee and wasp stings and to keep\r\nbooks and clothes from \"moths and other worms,\" of the making of\r\n\"fayre images\" and of boxes wherein to keep \"spycery\" from the wood of\r\nthe box-tree. Of the making of trestle tables \"areared and set upon\r\nfeet,\" of playing boards \"that men playe on at the dyes [dice] and\r\nother gamys. And this maner of table is double and arrayd wyth dyerse\r\ncolours.\" Of the making of writing tables, of wood used for flooring\r\nthat \"set in solar floors serue all men and bestys y{t} ben therein,\r\nand ben treden of alle men and beestys that come therein,\" and so\r\nstrong that \"they bende not nor croke [crack] whan they ben pressyd\r\nw{t} heuy thynges layd on them.\" And also of boards used for ships,\r\nbridges, hulks and coffers, and \"in shypbreche [shipwreck] men fle to\r\nbordes and ben ofte sauyd in peryll.\" Of the building of houses with\r\nroofs of \"trees stretchyd from the walles up to the toppe of ye\r\nhouse,\" with rafters \"stronge and square and hewen playne,\" and of\r\n\"the covering of strawe and thetche [thatch].\" Of the making of linen\r\nfrom the soaking of the flax in water till it is dried and turned in\r\nthe sun and then bound in \"praty bundels\" and \"afterward knockyd,\r\nbeten and brayd and carflyd, rodded and gnodded; ribbyd and heklyd and\r\nat the laste sponne,\" of the bleaching, and finally of its many uses\r\nfor making clothing, and for sails, and fish nets, and thread, and\r\nropes, and strings (\"for bows\"), and measuring lines, and sheets (\"to\r\nreste in\"), and sackes, and bagges, and purses (\"to put and to kepe\r\nthynges in\"). Of the making of tow \"uneven and full of knobs,\" used\r\nfor stuffing into the cracks in ships, and \"for bonds and byndynges\r\nand matches for candelles, for it is full drye and takyth sone fyre\r\nand brenneth.\" \"And so,\" he concludes somewhat breathlessly, \"none\r\nherbe is so nedefull to so many dyurrse uses to mankynde as is the\r\nflexe.\" Of the vineyard \"closyd about wyth walles and wyth hegges,\r\nwith a wayte [watch] set in an hyghe place to kepe the vynyerde that\r\nthe fruyte be not dystroyed.\" Of the desolation of the vineyard in\r\nwinter, \"but in harueste tyme many comyth and haunteth the vynyerde.\"\r\nOf the delicious smell of a vineyard. Of the damage done by foxes and\r\nswine and \"tame hounds.\" \"A few hounds,\" Bartholomew tells us, \"wasten\r\nand dystroye moo grapes that cometh and eteth therof theuylly\r\n[thievishly].\" \"A vineyard,\" he concludes, \"maye not be kepte nother\r\nsauyd but by his socour and helpe that all thynge hath and possesseth\r\nin his power and myghte. And kepyth and sauyth all lordly and\r\nmyghtily.\" And is there any other writer who in so few words tells us\r\nof the woods in those days? Of the \"beestis and foulis\" therein as\r\nwell as the herbs, of the woods in summer-time, of the hunting\r\ntherein, of the robbers and the difficulty of finding one's way? Of\r\nthe birds and the bees and the wild honey and the delicious coolness\r\nof the deep shade in summer, and the \"wery wayfarynge trauelynge men\"?\r\nAnd the final brief suggestion of the time when forests were veritable\r\nboundaries? I believe also that this is the only book in which we are\r\ntold of the interesting old custom of tying knots to the trees \"in\r\ntoken and marke of ye highe waye,\" and of robbers deliberately\r\nremoving them. The picture is so perfect that I give it in full:--\r\n\r\n    \"Woods ben wide places wast and desolate y{t} many trees\r\n    growe in w{t}oute fruyte and also few hauyinge fruyte. And\r\n    those trees whyche ben bareyne and beereth noo manere\r\n    fruyte alwaye ben generally more and hygher tha[=n]e y{t}\r\n    wyth fruyte, fewe out taken as Oke and Beche. In thyse wodes\r\n    ben ofte wylde beestes and foulis. Therein growyth herbes,\r\n    grasse, lees and pasture, and namely medycynall herbes in\r\n    wodes fo[=u]de. In somer wodes ben bewtyed [beautied] wyth\r\n    bowes and braunches, w{t} herbes and grasse. In wode is\r\n    place of disceyte [deceit] and of huntynge. For therin wylde\r\n    beest ben hunted: and watches and disceytes [deceits] ben\r\n    ordenyd and lette of houndes and of hunters. There is place\r\n    of hidynge and of lurkyng. For ofte in wodes theuys ben hyd,\r\n    and oft in their awaytes and disceytes passyng men cometh\r\n    and ben spoylled and robbed and ofte slayne. And soo for\r\n    many and dyuerse wayes and uncerten strange men ofte erre\r\n    and goo out of the waye. And take uncerten waye and the waye\r\n    that is unknowen before the waye that is knowen and come oft\r\n    to the place these theues lye in awayte and not wythout\r\n    peryll. Therefore ben ofte knottes made on trees and in\r\n    busshes in bowes and in braunches of trees; in token and\r\n    marke of ye highe waye; to shewe the certen and sure waye to\r\n    wayefareynge men. But oft theuys in tornynge and metyng of\r\n    wayes chaunge suche knottes and signes and begyle many men\r\n    and brynge them out of the ryght waye by false tokens and\r\n    sygnes. Byrdes, foules and bein [bees] fleeth to wode,\r\n    byrdes to make nestes and bein [bees] to gadre hony. Byrdes\r\n    to kepe themself from foulers and bein [bees] to hyde\r\n    themself to make honycombes preuely in holowe trees and\r\n    stockes. Also wodes for thyknesse of trees ben colde with\r\n    shadowe. And in hete of the sonne wery wayfarynge and\r\n    trauelynge men haue lykynge to have reste and to hele\r\n    themself in the shadow.

And by\r\n    weuynge and castyng togyder of trees often men kepeth and\r\n    defendyth themself from enymies.\"[43]\r\n\r\nBartholomew's book on herbs ends thus: \"And here we shall fynysshe\r\nand ende in treatyng of the XVII boke whyche hath treated as ye may\r\nopenly knowe of suche thynges as the Maker of all thyng hath ordered\r\nand brought forth by his myghty power to embelyssh and araye the erthe\r\nwyth and most specyally for ye fode of man and beast.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the book is the poem which has caused so much\r\ncontroversy amongst bibliographers. In this Wynken de Worde definitely\r\nstates that Caxton had a share in the first printing of this book at\r\nCologne:--\r\n\r\n    \"And also of your charyte call to remembraunce\r\n      The soule of William Caxton first pr[=y]ter of this boke.\r\n    In laten tonge at Coleyn hyself to auauce\r\n      That every well disposed man may therein loke.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, modern bibliographers are of opinion that Caxton\r\ncould not have played even a subordinate part in the printing of this\r\nbook at Cologne.\r\n\r\nDe Worde also refers to the maker of the paper[44]:--\r\n\r\n                    \"... John Tate the yonger ...\r\n    Which late hathe in England doo make this paper thynne\r\n    That now in our Englysh this boke is prynted Inne.\"\r\n\r\nThere is charm as well as pathos in the verses on the reproduction of\r\nmanuscripts in book form, showing us vividly what the recent discovery\r\nof the art of printing meant to the scholars of that day. The simile\r\nof Ph[oe]bus \"repairing\" the moon is very apt.\r\n\r\n    \"For yf one thyng myght laste a M yere\r\n      Full sone comyth aege that frettyth all away;\r\n    But like as Phebus wyth his bemes clere\r\n      The mone repeyreth as bryght as ony day\r\n      Whan she is wasted ryght; so may we say\r\n    Thise bokes old and blynde whan we renewe\r\n    By goodly pryntyng they ben bryght of hewe.\"\r\n\r\nThe last verse of the poem is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nowe gloryous god that regnest one in thre\r\n      And thre in one graunte vertu myght and grace\r\n    Unto the prynter of this werke that he\r\n      May be rewarded in thy heuenly place\r\n      And whan the worlde shall come before thy face\r\n    There to receue accordyng to desert\r\n    Of grace and mercy make hym then expert.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatise on herbs formed, as we have seen, only a part of\r\nBartholomew's _De Proprietatibus Rerum_, and, to speak strictly, the\r\nfirst printed English herbal was the small quarto volume published by\r\nRichard Banckes in 1525. It was the beginning of a series of small\r\nbooks[45] chiefly in black letter. All of them, though issued from\r\ndifferent presses, have nearly the same title, and they vary only\r\nslightly from the original _Banckes's Herbal_. The title of this\r\nHerbal is--\r\n\r\n    \"Here begynneth a new mater / the whiche sheweth and |\r\n    treateth of ye vertues & proprytes of her- | bes / the\r\n    whiche is called | an Herball ['.'] | ¶ Cum gratia &\r\n    priuilegio | a rege indulto |\r\n\r\n    \"(_Colophon_) ¶ Imprynted by me Rycharde Banckes / dwellynge\r\n    in | L[=o]d[=o] / a lytel fro ye Stockes in ye Pultry / ye\r\n    XXV day of | Marche. The yere of our Lorde MCCCCC. & XXV.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know who the author of this book was, and it has been\r\nsuggested that it is based on some mediæval English manuscript now\r\nlost. Certainly when one reads this anonymous work known as _Banckes's\r\nHerbal_ one is struck not only by its superiority to the later and\r\nmore famous _Grete Herball_, but also by its greater charm. It gives\r\nthe impression of being a compilation from various sources, the author\r\nhaving made his own selection from what pleased him most in the older\r\nEnglish manuscript herbals. It seems to have been a labour of love,\r\nwhereas the _Grete Herball_ is merely a translation. It is almost\r\ncertain that the writer made use of one of the numerous manuscript\r\nversions of Macer's Herbal, which in parts _Banckes's Herbal_\r\nresembles very closely, and the chapter on rosemary shows that he had\r\naccess to one of the copies of the manuscript on the virtues of\r\nrosemary which was sent by the Countess of Hainault to Queen Philippa.\r\nHe does not give the beautiful old tradition preserved in that\r\nmanuscript,[46] but he ascribes wonderful virtues to this herb, with\r\nthe same loving enthusiasm and almost in the same words. Of rosemary\r\nin _Banckes's Herbal_ we read:--\r\n\r\n    \"Take the flowers thereof and make powder thereof and binde\r\n    it to thy right arme in a linnen cloath and it shale make\r\n    thee light and merrie.\r\n\r\n    \"Take the flowers and put them in thy chest among thy\r\n    clothes or among thy Bookes and Mothes shall not destroy\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    \"Boyle the leaves in white wine and washe thy face therewith\r\n    and thy browes and thou shalt have a faire face.\r\n\r\n    \"Also put the leaves under thy bedde and thou shalt be\r\n    delivered of all evill dreames.\r\n\r\n    \"Take the leaves and put them into wine and it shall keep\r\n    the wine from all sourness and evill savours and if thou\r\n    wilt sell thy wine thou shalt have goode speede.\r\n\r\n    \"Also if thou be feeble boyle the leaves in cleane water and\r\n    washe thyself and thou shalt wax shiny.\r\n\r\n    \"Also if thou have lost appetite of eating boyle well these\r\n    leaves in cleane water and when the water is colde put\r\n    thereunto as much of white wine and then make sops, eat them\r\n    thereof wel and thou shalt restore thy appetite againe.\r\n\r\n    \"If thy legges be blowen with gowte boyle the leaves in\r\n    water and binde them in a linnen cloath and winde it about\r\n    thy legges and it shall do thee much good.\r\n\r\n    \"If thou have a cough drink the water of the leaves boyld in\r\n    white wine and ye shall be whole.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INITIAL LETTERS FROM \"BANCKES'S HERBAL\"]\r\n\r\n    \"Take the Timber thereof and burn it to coales and make\r\n    powder thereof and rubbe thy teeth thereof and it shall keep\r\n    thy teeth from all evils. Smell it oft and it shall keep\r\n    thee youngly.\r\n\r\n    \"Also if a man have lost his smellyng of the ayre that he\r\n    may not draw his breath make a fire of the wood and bake his\r\n    bread therewith, eate it and it shall keepe him well.\r\n\r\n    \"Make thee a box of the wood of rosemary and smell to it and\r\n    it shall preserve thy youth.\"\r\n\r\nThat _Banckes's Herbal_ achieved immediate popularity is attested by\r\nthe fact that the following year another edition of it was issued, and\r\nduring the next thirty years various London printers issued the same\r\nbook under different titles.[47] Robert Wyer[48] ascribed the\r\nauthorship of those he issued to Macer, and in the edition of 1530 he\r\nadded, after \"Macer's Herbal,\" \"Practysed by Dr. Lynacro.\" Whether\r\nthis statement is true it is impossible to discover, but we know that\r\nthe great doctor died some years before Wyer set up as a printer, and\r\nhis name does not appear in any of the subsequent editions of the\r\nherbal issued by other printers. In Wyer's edition there are some good\r\ninitial letters very similar to those used by Wynkyn de Worde.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting edition of the herbal is that printed by William\r\nCopland, in which first appear the additional chapters on \"The virtues\r\nof waters stylled,\" \"The tyme of gathering of sedes\" and \"A general\r\nrule of all maner of herbes.\" He issued two editions bearing the same\r\ntitle and differing only in the woodcuts and the colophon. The title\r\nis \"A boke of the | propreties of Herbes called an her- | ball,\r\nwhereunto is added the tyme y{e} | herbes, floures and Sedes shold |\r\nbe gathered to be kept the whole, ye- | re, with the vertue of ye\r\nHerbes wh[=e] | they are stylled. Al- | so a generall rule of all\r\nma- | ner of Herbes drawen | out of an auncyent | booke of Phisyck |\r\nby W. C.\" The woodcut in the first edition is three \"Tudor\" roses in a\r\ndouble circle with a crown over one of the roses and across the riband\r\n\"K[=y]ge of floures.\" In the second edition the woodcut is a quaint\r\nlittle representation of a lady seated in a garden. One man standing\r\nbehind her is holding her and another is walking towards her. The\r\nthree figures are near a wall, on the other side of which several men\r\nare apparently conversing. Who W. C. was is uncertain. In the\r\n_Dictionary of National Biography_ William Copland is said to be both\r\nthe author and the printer of the book, but in many catalogues\r\n(notably in that of the British Museum) Walter Cary figures as the\r\nauthor. In a lengthy account of the Carys in _Notes and Queries_\r\n(March 29, 1913) Mr. A. L. Humphreys disposes conclusively of the\r\nsupposition that W. C. can stand for Walter Cary.\r\n\r\n    \"_A Boke of the Properties of Herbes_ bears on the\r\n    title-page the initials W. C., which may stand either for\r\n    Copland or Cary. This was one of several editions of\r\n    _Banckes's Herbal_, then very popular, and although it may\r\n    have been edited or promoted in some way by a Walter Cary,\r\n    it could not have been by the one who wrote _The Hammer for\r\n    the Stone_. The 'Herball' was issued somewhere about 1550\r\n    and various editions of it exist, but all these appeared\r\n    when the Walter Cary we are considering was a child. There\r\n    is, however, a connection between the Carys and herbals,\r\n    because it is well known that Henry Lyte (1529-1607) of\r\n    Lytes Cary was the famous translator of Dodoens's _Herball_\r\n    (1578), and he had a herbal garden at Lytes Cary.\"\r\n\r\nAmes in his _Typographical Antiquities_ describes the two editions,\r\nwhich are identical, as though they were two different books, and\r\nascribes one to Walter Cary and the other to William Copland. We have\r\nonly Ames's authority for the supposition that Copland was the\r\ncompiler as well as the printer. The herbal in question is merely\r\nanother edition of _Banckes's Herbal_, but it is quite possible that\r\nthe three additional chapters at the end were \"drawen out of an\r\nauncyent booke of Physick\" by Copland.[49]\r\n\r\nTwo editions of _Banckes's Herbal_ are ascribed, on account of the\r\nwording of the title, to Antony Askham, and the title is so attractive\r\nthat it is a disappointment to find that the astrological additions\r\n\"declaryng what herbes hath influence of certain sterres and\r\nconstellations,\" etc., do not appear in any known copy of the herbal.\r\nThis astrological lore from the famous man who combined the\r\nprofessions of priest, physician and astrologer in the reign of Edward\r\nVI. would be of remarkable interest. But it has been pointed out by\r\nMr. H. M. Barlow[50] that, if the bibliographers who have attributed\r\nthe work to Askham had examined the title of the work with greater\r\ncare, they would have observed that the phrase \"by Anthonye Askham\"\r\nrefers not to the substance of the book itself (which is merely\r\nanother edition of _Banckes's Herbal_) but to the \"Almanacke\" from\r\nwhich the additions were intended to be taken, though apparently they\r\nwere never printed. The title of \"Askham's\" Herbal is--\r\n\r\n    \"A lytel | herball of the | properties of her- | bes newely\r\n    amended and corrected, | with certayne addicions at the ende\r\n    | of the boke, declarying what herbes | hath influence of\r\n    certaine Sterres | and constellations, whereby may be |\r\n    chosen the beast and most luckye | tymes and dayes of their\r\n    mini- | stracion, accordyinge to the | Moone being in the\r\n    sig- | nes of heauen, the | which is dayly | appoynted | in\r\n    the | Almanacke; made and gathered | in the yere of our\r\n    Lorde god | M.D.L. the XII. day of Fe- | bruary by Anthonye\r\n    | Askham Phi- | sycyon.\r\n\r\n    \"(_Colophon._) Imprynted at | London in Flete- | strete at\r\n    the signe of the George | next to Saynte Dunstones | Churche\r\n    by Wylly- | am Powell. | In the yeare of oure Lorde | M.D.L.\r\n    the twelfe day of Marche.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some charming prescriptions to be found in \"Askham's\"\r\nHerbal. Under \"rose,\" for instance, we have recipes for \"melroset,\"\r\n\"sugar roset,\" \"syrope of Rooses,\" \"oyle of roses\" and \"rose water.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Melrosette is made thus. Take faire purified honye and new\r\n    read rooses, the whyte endes of them clypped awaye, th[=a]\r\n    chop theym smal and put th[=e] into the Hony and boyl th[=e]\r\n    menely together; to know whan it is boyled ynoughe, ye shal\r\n    know it by the swete odour and the colour read. Fyve yeares\r\n    he may be kept in his vertue; by the Roses he hath vertue of\r\n    comfortinge and by the hony he hath vertu of clensinge.\r\n\r\n    \"Syrope of Rooses is made thus. Some do take roses dyght as\r\n    it is sayd and boyle them in water and in the water strayned\r\n    thei put suger and make a sirope thereof; and some do make\r\n    it better, for they put roses in a vessell, hauing a\r\n    strayght mouthe, and they put to the roses hote water and\r\n    thei let it stande a day and a night and of that water,\r\n    putting to it suger, thei do make sirope, and some doe put\r\n    more of Roses in the forsaid vessel and more of hote water,\r\n    and let it stande as is beforesaide, and so they make a read\r\n    water and make the rose syrope. And some do st[=a]pe new\r\n    Roses and then strayne out the joyce of it and suger\r\n    therwyth, they make sirope: and this is the best making of\r\n    sirope. In Wynter and in Somer it maye be geuen competently\r\n    to feble sicke mel[=a]coly and colorike people.\r\n\r\n    \"Sugar Roset is made thus--Take newe gathered roses and\r\n    st[=a]pe them righte smal with sugar, th[=a] put in a glasse\r\n    XXX. dayes, let it stande in ye sunne and stirre it wel, and\r\n    medle it well together so it may be kept three yeares in his\r\n    vertue. The qu[=a]titie of sugar and roses should be thus.\r\n    In IIII. pound of sugar a pounde of roses.\r\n\r\n    \"Oyle of roses is made thus. Some boyle roses in oyle and\r\n    kepe it, some do fyll a glasse with roses and oyle and they\r\n    boyle it in a caudron full of water and this oyle is good.\r\n    Some stampe fresh roses with oyle and they put it in a\r\n    vessel of glasse and set it in the s[=u]ne IIII. dais and\r\n    this oyle is good.\r\n\r\n    \"Rose water.

Take out that lycoure with a spone and put\r\nit into a clean glas and do so every day as long as thou fyndest ought\r\nin the hole, and this must be done in the moneth of April or Maye,\r\nthan anoynt the sore therwith against the fyre, th[=a] wete a lynnen\r\nclothe in the same lycoure and lappe it about the sore and it shal be\r\nhole in shorte space on warrantyse by the Grace of God.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike the later _Grete Herball_, Askham gives some descriptions of\r\nthe herbs themselves, notably in the case of alleluia (wood-sorrel),\r\nwater crowfoot, and asterion.\r\n\r\n    \"This herbe alleluia m[=e] call it Wodsour or Stubwort, this\r\n    herbe hath thre leaves ye which be ro[=u]d a litel departed\r\n    aboue and it hath a whyte flour, but it hath no l[=o]ge\r\n    stalkes and it is Woodsoure and it is like thre leued\r\n    grasse. The vertue of this herbe is thus, if it be rosted in\r\n    the ashes in red docke leaves or in red wort leaves it\r\n    fretteth awai dead flesh of a wounde. This herbe groweth\r\n    much in woodes.\"\r\n\r\n    Water crowfoot: \"This herb that men call water crowfoot hath\r\n    yelow floures, as hath crowfoot and of the same shap, but\r\n    the leves are more departed as it were Rammes fete, and it\r\n    hath a long stalke and out of that one stalke groweth many\r\n    stalkes smal by ye sides. This herb groweth in watery\r\n    places.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Asterion or Lunary groweth among stoones and in high\r\n    places, this herb shyneth by night and he bringeth forth\r\n    purple floures hole and rounde as a knockebell or else lyke\r\n    to foxgloves, the leves of this herbe be rounde and blew and\r\n    they have the mark of the Moone in the myddes as it were\r\n    thre leved grasse, but the leaves therof be more and they be\r\n    round as a peny.

And it hath many more vertues than I\r\n    can tell at this tyme.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the unidentified herbs is called \"sene,\" and we are given the\r\nsomewhat vague geographical information, \"It groweth in the other syde\r\nthe sea and moste aboute Babilon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother small book printed by William Copland must be mentioned, for,\r\nalthough it is not a herbal, it contains a great deal of curious herb\r\nlore not to be found elsewhere. This is _The boke of secretes of\r\nAlbartus Magnus of the vertues of Herbes, Stones, and certaine\r\nbeastes_. Who the author was is unknown, but he was certainly not\r\nAlbert of Bollstadt (1193-1280), Bishop of Ratisbon, the scholastic\r\nphilosopher to whom it was ascribed, probably in order to increase its\r\nsale. There is one philosophical remark which is not unworthy of the\r\nfamous Bishop: \"Every man despiseth ye thyng whereof he knoweth\r\nnothynge and that hath done no pleasure to him.\" But for the most part\r\nit deals with the popular beliefs concerning the mystical properties\r\nof herbs, stones and animals.\r\n\r\nOf celandine the writer tells us: \"This hearbe springeth in the time\r\nin ye which the swallowes and also ye Eagles maketh theyr nestes. If\r\nany man shal have this herbe with ye harte of a Molle (mole) he shall\r\novercome all his enemies.... And if the before named hearbe be put\r\nupon the headde of a sycke man if he should dye he shal syng anone\r\nwith a loud voyce, if not he shall weep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perwynke when it is beat[=e] unto pouder with wormes of ye earth\r\nwrapped aboute it and with an herbe called houslyke it induceth love\r\nbetween man and wyfe if it bee used in their meales ... if the sayde\r\nconfection be put in the fyre it shall be turned anone unto blue\r\ncoloure.\"\r\n\r\nOf the herb which, he tells us, \"the men of Chaldea called roybra,\" he\r\nsays: \"He that holdeth this herbe in hys h[=a]de with an herbe called\r\nMylfoyle or yarowe or noseblede is sure from all feare and fantasye or\r\nvysion. And yf it be put with the juyce of houselyke and the bearers\r\nhands be anoynted with it and the residue be put in water if he entre\r\nin ye water where fyshes be they wil gather together to hys handes ...\r\nand if hys hande be draw[=e] forth they will leape agayne to theyre\r\nowne places where they were before.\"\r\n\r\nOf hound's tongue: \"If ye shall have the aforenamed herbe under thy\r\nformost toe al the dogges shall kepe silence and shall not have power\r\nto bark. And if thou shalt put the aforesayde thinge in the necke of\r\nany dogge so y{t} he maye not touche it with his mouthe he shalbe\r\nturned always round about lyke a turning whele untill he fall unto the\r\ngrounde as dead and this hath bene proved in our tyme.\"\r\n\r\nOf centaury: \"If it be joyned with the bloude of a female lapwing or\r\nblack plover and be put with oyle in a lampe, all they that compasse\r\nit aboute shal beleue themselves to be witches so that one shall\r\nbeleve of an other that his head is in heaven and his fete in the\r\nearth. And if the aforesaid thynge be put in the fire whan the starres\r\nshine it shall appeare y{t} the sterres runne one agaynste another and\r\nfyght.\"\r\n\r\nOf vervain: \"This herbe (as witches say) gathered, the sunne beyng in\r\nthe signe of the Ram, and put with grayne or corne of pyonie of one\r\nyeare olde healeth them y{t} be sicke of ye falling sykenes.\"\r\n\r\nOf powder of roses: \"If the aforesayde poulder be put in a lampe and\r\nafter be kindled all men shall appeare blacke as the deuell. And if\r\nthe aforesaid poulder be mixed with oyle of the olyue tree and with\r\nquycke brymstone and the house anointed wyth it, the Sunne shyning, it\r\nshall appeare all inflamed.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOODCUT FROM THE TITLE-PAGE OF THE \"GRETE HERBALL\"\r\n      (1526)]\r\n\r\nOf verbena: \"Infants bearing it shalbe very apte to learne and louing\r\nlearnynge and they shalbe glad and joyous.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the only book on the virtues of herbs in which I have found a\r\nrecipe to revive drowning flies and bees! This is to be done by\r\nplacing them in warm ashes of pennyroyal, and then \"they shall recover\r\ntheir lyfe after a little tyme as by ye space of one houre.\" The book\r\nends with a curious philosophical dissertation, \"Of the mervels of the\r\nworlde,\" which is followed by a series of charms--to stop a cock\r\ncrowing, to make men look as though they had no heads, to obtain rule\r\nover all birds, to keep flies away from a house, to write letters\r\nwhich can only be read at night, to make men look as though they had\r\n\"the countenance of a dog,\" to make men seem as though they had three\r\nheads, to understand the language of birds, to make men seem like\r\nangels, and to put things in the fire without their being consumed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough lacking in the charm of the quaint and typically English\r\n_Banckes's Herbal_, the most famous of the early printed herbals was\r\nthe _Grete Herball_ printed by Peter Treveris in 1526.[52]\r\n\r\n    \"The grete herball | whiche geueth parfyt knowlege and\r\n    under- | standyng of all maner of herbes & there gracyous\r\n    vertues whiche god hath | ordeyned for our prosperous\r\n    welfare and helth, for they hele & cure all maner | of\r\n    dyseases and sekenesses that fall or mysfortune to all maner\r\n    of creatoures | of god created, practysed by many expert and\r\n    wyse maysters, as Auicenna and | other &c. Also it geueth\r\n    full parfyte understandynge of the booke lately pryn | ted\r\n    by me (Peter treveris) named the noble experiens of the\r\n    vertuous hand | warke of surgery.\"\r\n\r\n    (_Colophon._) \"Imprentyd at London in South- | warke by me\r\n    peter Treueris, dwel- | lynge in the sygne of the wodows |\r\n    In the yere of our Lorde god M.D. | XXVI the XXVII day of\r\n    July.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the introduction it was compiled from the works of \"many\r\nnoble doctoures and experte maysters in medecines, as Auicenna,\r\nPandecta, Constantinus, Wilhelmus, Platearius, Rabbi Moyses, Johannes\r\nMesue, Haly, Albertus, Bartholomeus and more other.\" But with the\r\nexception of the preface the _Grete Herball_ is a translation of the\r\nwell-known French herbal, _Le Grant Herbier_. Until about 1886 _Le\r\nGrant Herbier_ was supposed to be a translation of the _Herbarius zu\r\nTeutsch_, published at Mainz in 1485, or of the _Ortus Sanitatis_,\r\nprinted also at Mainz in 1491.[53] The _Herbarius zu Teutsch_, which\r\nwas probably compiled by a Frankfort physician, is a fine herbal\r\nbeautifully illustrated, and the later _Ortus Sanitatis_ is by some\r\nauthorities supposed to be a Latin translation of it. To judge from\r\nthe preface to the German Herbarius it was a labour of love,\r\nundertaken by a man who apparently was possessed of ample wealth and\r\nleisure; for in his preface he tells us that he \"caused this\r\npraiseworthy work to be begun by a Master learned in physic,\" and\r\nthen, finding that as many of the herbs did not grow in his native\r\nland he could not draw them \"with their true colours and form,\" he\r\nleft the work unfinished and journeyed through many lands--Italy,\r\nCroatia, Albania, Dalmatia, Greece, Corfu, Candia, Rhodes, Cyprus, the\r\nHoly Land, Arabia, Babylonia and Egypt. He was accompanied by \"a\r\npainter ready of wit and cunning and subtle of hand,\" and was thus\r\nable to have the herbs \"truly drawn.\" The book he compiled on his\r\nreturn was long regarded as the original of the French herbal, _Le\r\nGrant Herbier_, but in 1866 Professor Giulio Camus found two\r\nfifteenth-century manuscripts in the Biblioteca Estense at Modena, one\r\nthe Latin work commonly known from the opening words as _Circa\r\nInstans_, and the other a French translation of the same manuscript.\r\nIt was always supposed by medical historians that the _Circa Instans_\r\nwas written by Matthaeus Platearius of Salerno in the twelfth century,\r\nbut in Professor Camus's memoir, _L'Opéra Saleritana \"Circa Instans\"\r\ned il testo primitivo del \"Grand Herbier in Francoys\" secundo duo\r\ncodici del secolo XV conservati nella Regia Biblioteca Estense_, there\r\nare reproduced the French verses in which occurs the line, \"Il a esté\r\nescript Millccc cinquante et huit,\" and Mr. H. M. Barlow[54] supports\r\nthe deduction that _Circa Instans_ was not written by a Salernitan\r\nphysician, but by a writer described in the verses as \"Bartholomaeus\r\nminid' senis\" in 1458. _Le Grant Herbier_, of which the English _Grete\r\nHerball_ is a translation, is a version of the French manuscript\r\ntranslation of _Circa Instans_, and therefore, as _Circa Instans_ is\r\nolder than either the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_ or the Latin _Ortus\r\nSanitatis_, it would seem that it is the real original of our _Grete\r\nHerball_. The preface to the _Grete Herball_, however, bears a strong\r\nresemblance to that of the German Herbarius, of which I quote a part\r\nfrom Dr. Arber's translation, made from the second (Augsburg) edition\r\nof 1485. They have been placed in parallel columns to show how closely\r\nthe English preface follows that of the German Herbarius.\r\n\r\n    Preface to the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_.\r\n\r\n    \"Many a time and oft have I contemplated\r\n    inwardly the wondrous\r\n    works of the creator of the universe:\r\n    how in the beginning He formed\r\n    the heavens and adorned them with\r\n    goodly shining stars, to which he\r\n    gave power and might to influence\r\n    everything under heaven. Also how\r\n    he afterwards formed the four elements:\r\n    fire, hot and dry--air, hot\r\n    and moist--water, cold and moist--earth,\r\n    dry and cold--and gave to\r\n    each a nature of its own; and how\r\n    after this the same Great Master of\r\n    Nature made and formed herbs of\r\n    many sorts and animals of all kinds\r\n    and last of all Man, the noblest of\r\n    all created things. Thereupon I\r\n    thought on the wondrous order which\r\n    the Creator gave these same creatures\r\n    of His, so that everything which\r\n    has its being under heaven receives\r\n    it from the stars and keeps it by\r\n    their help. I considered further how\r\n    that in everything which arises, grows,\r\n    lives or soars in the four elements\r\n    named, be it metal, stone, herb or\r\n    animal, the four natures of the elements,\r\n    heat, cold, moistness and\r\n    dryness, are mingled. It is also to\r\n    be noted that the four natures in\r\n    question are also mixed and blended\r\n    in the human body in a measure and\r\n    temperament suitable to the life and\r\n    nature of man; while man keeps\r\n    within this measure ... he is strong\r\n    and healthy, but as soon as he steps\r\n    or falls beyond ... which happens\r\n    when heat takes the upper hand and\r\n    strives to stifle cold or on the contrary\r\n    when cold begins to suppress\r\n    heat ... he falls of necessity into\r\n    sickness and draws nigh unto death.\r\n    ... Of a truth I would as soon count\r\n    the leaves on the trees or the grains\r\n    of sand in the sea as the things\r\n    which are the causes of man's sickness.\r\n    It is for this reason that so\r\n    many thousands and thousands of\r\n    perils and dangers beset man. He is\r\n    not fully sure of his health or his\r\n    life for one moment. While considering\r\n    these matters, I also remembered\r\n    how the Creator of Nature,\r\n    who has placed us amid such dangers\r\n    has mercifully provided us with a\r\n    remedy, that is with all kinds of\r\n    herbs, animals and other created\r\n    things.... By virtue of these herbs\r\n    and created things the sick man may\r\n    recover the temperament of the four\r\n    elements and the health of his body.\r\n    Since then man can have no greater\r\n    nor nobler treasure on earth than\r\n    bodily health, I came to the conclusion\r\n    that I could not perform any\r\n    more useful and holy work than to\r\n    compile a book in which could be\r\n    contained the virtue and nature of\r\n    many herbs and other created things,\r\n    together with their true colours and\r\n    for the help of all the world, and the\r\n    common good, therefore I caused\r\n    this praiseworthy work to be begun\r\n    by a Master learned in physic who,\r\n    at my request gathered into a book\r\n    the nature and virtue of many herbs\r\n    out of the acknowledged masters of\r\n    physic, Galen, Avicenna, Serapio,\r\n    Dioscorides, Pandectarius, Platearius\r\n    and others.\"\r\n\r\n        Preface to _The Grete Herball_.\r\n\r\n        \"Consyderynge the grete goodnesse\r\n        of almyghty God creatour of\r\n        heven and erthe, and al thynge\r\n        therin comprehended to whom be\r\n        eternall laude and prays etc. Consyderynge\r\n        the cours and nature of\r\n        the foure elementes and qualytees\r\n        where to ye nature of man is inclyned,\r\n        out of the whiche elementes issueth\r\n        dyvers qualytees infyrmytees and\r\n        dyseases in the corporate body of\r\n        man, but god of his goodnesse that\r\n        is creatour of all thynges hath\r\n        ordeyned for mankynd (whiche he\r\n        hath created to his own lykenesse)\r\n        for the grete and tender love, which\r\n        he hath unto hym, to whom all\r\n        thinges erthely he hath ordeyned to\r\n        be obeysant, for the sustentacyon\r\n        and helthe of his lovynge creature\r\n        mankynde whiche is onely made\r\n        egally of the foure elementes and\r\n        qualitees of the same, and when\r\n        any of these foure habounde or hath\r\n        more domynacyon, the one than the\r\n        other it constrayneth ye body of\r\n        man to grete infyrmytees or dyseases,\r\n        for the which ye eternall god hath\r\n        gyven of his haboundante Grace,\r\n        vertues in all maner of herbes to\r\n        cure and heale all maner of sekenesses\r\n        or infyrmytees to hym befallying\r\n        through the influent course\r\n        of the foure elementes beforesayd\r\n        and of the corrupcyons and ye\r\n        venymous ayres contrarye ye helthe\r\n        of man.

But if the illustrations are poor and dull the\r\nfrontispiece and the full-page woodcut of the printer's mark are very\r\nmuch the reverse. The frontispiece is a charming woodcut of a man\r\nholding a spade in his right hand and gathering grapes, and a woman\r\nthrowing flowers and herbs out of her apron into a basket. There are\r\ntwo figures in the lower corners, the one of a male and the other of a\r\nfemale mandrake. The woodcut of the printer's mark at the end sheds an\r\ninteresting ray of light on the Peter Treveris who issued the two\r\nfirst editions of this Herball.[56] The woodcut represents two\r\nwodows[57] (savages), a man and a woman, on either side of a tree,\r\nfrom which is suspended a shield with Peter Treveris's initials. Ames\r\nsupposes that Treveris was a native of Trèves and took his name from\r\nthat city, but it is more likely that he was a member of the Cornish\r\nfamily of Treffry, which is sometimes spelt Treveris. A Sir John\r\nTreffry, who fought at Poitiers, took as supporters to his arms a wild\r\nman and woman, and one likes to find that one of his descendants\r\nperpetuated the memory of his gallant ancestor by adopting the same\r\nsign for his trade device.\r\n\r\nThe _Grete Herball_ is alphabetically arranged, for the idea of the\r\nnatural relationship of plants was unknown at that time. But we find a\r\n\"classification\" of fungi. \"Fungi ben musherons. There be two maners\r\nof them, one maner is deadly and sleeth them that eateth of them and\r\nthe other dooth not\"! As in most sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\r\nherbals, there are quaint descriptions of a good many things besides\r\nherbs. The most gruesome of these is a substance briefly described as\r\n\"mummy,\" and the accompanying illustration is of a man digging beside\r\na tomb. \"Mummy,\" one reads, \"is a maner of spyces or confectyons that\r\nis founde in the sepulchres or tombes of dead bodyes that haue be\r\nconfyct with spyces. And it is to wyte that in olde tyme men were wont\r\nto confyct the deed corpses and anoynte them with bawme and myre\r\nsmellynge swete. And yet ye paynims about babylon kepe that custome\r\nfor there is grete quantity of bawme. And this mummye is specially\r\nfounde about the brayne and about the maronge in the rydge bone. For\r\nthe blode by reason of the bawme draweth to the brayne and thereabout\r\nis chauffed. And lykewise is the brayne brent and parched and is the\r\nquantyte of mommye and so the blode is mroeued in the rydge of the\r\nbacke. That mommye is to be chosen that is bryght blacke stynkynge and\r\nstyffe. And that y{t} is whyt and draweth to a dymme colour and that\r\nis not stynkynge nor styffe, and that powdreth lightly is naught. It\r\nhath vertue to restrayne or staunche.\"[58]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOODCUT OF PETER TREVERIS' SIGN OF THE \"WODOWS\"\r\n      FROM THE \"GRETE HERBALL\" (1529)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOODCUT FROM THE TITLE-PAGE OF THE FOURTH EDITION\r\n      OF THE \"GRETE HERBALL\" (1561)]\r\n\r\nOther substances described are salt, cheese, pitch, lead, silver,\r\ngold, amber, water, starch, vinegar, butter, honey and the lodestone.\r\nThe dissertation on water shows very clearly that our ancestors\r\nregarded bathing as a fad, and a dangerous fad at that. The writer\r\ngloomily observes, \"many folke that hath bathed them in colde water\r\nhaue dyed or they came home.\" And those who are foolish enough to\r\ndrink water he warns by quoting the authority of \"Mayster Isaac,\" who\r\n\"sayth that it is impossible for them that drynketh overmuche water in\r\ntheyr youth to come to ye age that God hath ordeyned them.\" In the\r\ndescription of the lodestone we find the well-known popular belief\r\nabout ships being drawn to their destruction. \"The lodestone, the\r\nadamant stone that draweth yren hath myghte to draw yren as Aristotle\r\nsayth. And is founde in the brymmes of the occyan see. And there be\r\nhillis of it and these hyllis drawe ye shippes that haue nayles of\r\nyren to them and breke the shyppes by drawynge of the nayles out.\" The\r\naccompanying illustration is of a sinking ship with a man going\r\ntowards the hill of adamant with uplifted hands, while another man is\r\nswimming, and a third sits calmly in the ship.\r\n\r\nIn view of the free use of honey in olden times, the account of honey\r\nin the _Grete Herball_ seems inadequate. \"Hony is made by artyfyce and\r\ncraft of bees. The whyche bees draweth the thynnest parte of the\r\nfloures and partelye of the thickest and moost grosse and thereof\r\nmaketh hony and waxe and also they make a substaunce that is called\r\nthe honycombe. The tame hony is that that is made in the hous or hyues\r\nthat labourers ordeyneth for the sayd bees to lodge and worke in. Hony\r\nis whyte in cold places and browne in warm place. And hony ought to be\r\nput in medicyne and may be kept C yeeres. There is an other that is\r\ncalled wylde hony and is found in woodes and is not so good as the\r\nother and is more bytter. Also there is a honey called castanea\r\nbecause it is made of chestayne floures that the bees sucketh and is\r\nbytter.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Grete Herball_, as in _Banckes's Herball_, we find numerous\r\ninstances of the use of herbs as amulets or for their effect on the\r\nmind, and for the smoking of patients with their fumes. I quote the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n    \"Betony. For them that be ferfull. For them that ben to\r\n    ferfull gyue two dragmes of powdre hereof wt warme water and\r\n    as moche wyne at the tyme that the fere cometh.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Buglos. To preserve the mynde. This herbe often eaten\r\n    confermeth and conserueth the mynde as many wyse maysters\r\n    sayth.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To make folke mery. Take the water that buglos hath b[=e]\r\n    soden in and sprynkle it about the hous or chambre and all\r\n    that be therein shall be mery.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Vervain. To make folke mery at ye table. To make all them\r\n    in a hous to be mery take foure leaves and foure rotes of\r\n    vervayn in wyne, than spryncle the wine all about the hous\r\n    where the eatynge is and they shall be all mery.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Musk. Agaynst weyknesse of the brayne smel to musk.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Struci[=u]n. Against lytargye blowe the powdre of the sede\r\n    in to the nose or elles sethe the sede thereof and juice of\r\n    rue in stronge vyneygre and rubbe the hynder parte of ye\r\n    head therwith.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Artemisia.

The book was translated into English\r\nby Laurence Andrew and, though strictly it does not come within the\r\ncategory of herbals, part of the preface is too beautiful to omit.\r\n\"Lerne the hygh and meruelous vertue of herbes.

Herbals.\r\n\r\n[39] He is sometimes erroneously called Bartholomew de Glanville.\r\nLeland, without citing any authority, called him de Glanville. Bale\r\ncopied Leland in 1557 and added a list of writings wrongly attributed\r\nto Bartholomew. Quétif and Echard give detailed reasons in pointing\r\nout Leland's error. The Parmese chronicler, Salimbene, writing in\r\n1283, refers to him as Bartholomæus Anglicus, and John de Trittenheim,\r\nAbbot of Sparheim (end of fifteenth century), speaks of him as\r\n\"Bartholomeus natione Anglicus.\" M. Leopold Delisle endeavoured to\r\nclaim him as a Frenchman, but although he spent the greater part of\r\nhis life abroad, he was always distinguished as \"Bartholomæus\r\nAnglicus.\" That he was a Minorite \"de provincia Francia\" is no proof\r\nthat he was a Frenchman. Batman (1582), on the authority of Bale,\r\ndescribes Bartholomæus as being \"of the noble familie of the Earles of\r\nSuffolk.\"\r\n\r\n[40] John de Trevisa, a Cornishman, was a Fellow of Exeter College,\r\nOxford, and subsequently of Queen's College. He afterwards became\r\nchaplain to Lord Berkeley and vicar of Berkeley.\r\n\r\n[41] Wynkyn de Worde's real name was Jan van Wynkyn (de Worde being\r\nmerely a place-name), and in the sacrist's rolls of Westminster Abbey,\r\n1491-1500, he figures as Johannes Wynkyn.\r\n\r\n[42] \"The rind thereof medled with wine ... gene to them to drink that\r\nshall be cut in their body for they should slepe and not fele the sore\r\nknitting.\"\r\n\r\n[43] Under \"Birch\" there is another touch of life in the woods in the\r\nMiddle Ages. \"Wylde men of wodes and forestes useth that sede instede\r\nof breede [bread].

He came of a Buckinghamshire family and was\r\nprobably a near relation of John Wyer, also a printer who lived in\r\nFleet Street, for both of them used the device of St. John the\r\nEvangelist. He served his apprenticeship to Richard Pynson, whose\r\nprinting press was in the rentals of Norwich House near the site of\r\nthe present Villiers Street, and on Pynson's death succeeded to the\r\nbusiness. In both his editions of the herbal there is his well-known\r\ndevice of St. John the Evangelist bareheaded and dressed in a flowing\r\nrobe, sitting under a tree on an island and writing on a scroll spread\r\nover his right knee. At his right hand is an eagle with outstretched\r\nwings holding an inkwell in its beak, and in the background are the\r\ntowers and spires of a great city.\r\n\r\n[49] Ames catalogues two other editions of the herbal by \"W. C.,\" one\r\npublished by Anthony Kitson and the other by Richard Kele, but no\r\nknown copies of these exist.\r\n\r\n[50] Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, 1913.\r\n\r\n[51] The popular belief in the power of sweet-smelling herbs to ward\r\noff infection of the much-dreaded plague rose to its height in Charles\r\nII.'s reign, when bunches of rosemary were sold for six and\r\neightpence. Till recently there were at least two survivals of this\r\nbelief in herbal scents--the doctor's gold-headed cane (formerly a\r\npomander carried at the end of a cane) and the little bouquets carried\r\nby the clergy at the distribution of the Maundy Money in Westminster\r\nAbbey.\r\n\r\n[52] For dates of later editions see Bibliography of English Herbals.\r\n\r\n[53] For fuller bibliographical details of the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_\r\nand the _Ortus Sanitatis_ see Bibliography of Foreign Herbals.\r\n\r\n[54] Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine.\r\n\r\n[55] The illustrations in the second and later editions of the\r\n_Herbarius zu Teutsch_ are very inferior to those in the first, which\r\nare beautiful. _The vertuose boke of Distillacyon of the waters of all\r\nmaner of Herbes_ (1527), translated by Laurence Andrew from the _Liber\r\nde arte distillandi_ by Hieronymus Braunschweig, is illustrated with\r\ncuts from the same wood-blocks as the _Grete Herball_.\r\n\r\n[56] Titles and dates of the subsequent editions issued by Thomas\r\nGibson (1539) and Jhon Kynge (1561) will be found in the Bibliography\r\nof English Herbals.\r\n\r\n[57] Treveris had his printing office in Southwark, at the sign of the\r\n\"Wodows.\"\r\n\r\n[58] The use of \"mummy\" is not only mentioned by all the later\r\nherbalists up to the end of the seventeenth century, but is even to be\r\nfound in MS. still-room books. In the Fairfax still-room book a recipe\r\nfor wounds said to have been procured from \"Rodolphus Goclerius,\r\nprofessor of Phisicke in Wittenburghe,\" begins thus: \"Take of the moss\r\nof a strangled man 2 ounces, of the mumia of man's blood, one ounce\r\nand a halfe of earth-worms washed in water or wine and dyed,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTURNER'S HERBAL AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE FOREIGN HERBALISTS\r\n\r\n    \"In the beginning of winter the Goldfinches use muche to\r\n    haunte this herbe [teazle] for the sedes sake whereof they\r\n    are very desyrous.\"--_Turner's Herbal_, 1551.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike so many sixteenth-century notabilities, William Turner, commonly\r\nknown as the father of English botany, was remarkably versatile, for\r\nhe was a divine, a physician and a botanist. He was a native of\r\nMorpeth, Northumberland, and was born in Henry VIII.'s reign: the\r\nexact date is unknown. His father is supposed to have been a tanner.\r\nWe know nothing of his early education, but he entered what is now\r\nPembroke College,[59] Cambridge, under the patronage of Thomas Lord\r\nWentworth. This he himself tells us in the preface to the second part\r\nof his herbal, which is dedicated to Lord Wentworth of the next\r\ngeneration. \"And who hath deserved better to have my booke of herbs to\r\nbe given to him, than he, whose father with his yearly exhibition did\r\nhelpe me, beying student in Cambridge of Physik and philosophy?\r\nWhereby with some further help and study am commed to this pore\r\nknowledge of herbes and other simples that I have. Wherefore I\r\ndedicate unto you this my litle boke, desyring you to defende it\r\nagainst the envious evil speakers, which can alow nothing but that\r\nthey do themselves: and the same I give unto your Lordship, beseeching\r\nto take it in the stede of a better thyng, and for a token of my good\r\nwill toward you, and all your father's houshold, which thing if ye\r\ndo, as sonne as I shall have convenient lesure, ye shall have the\r\nthird and last parte of my herball also. Almighty God kepe you and all\r\nyoures. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAt Cambridge Turner was intimate with Nicholas Ridley (afterwards the\r\nfamous Bishop of London), and though it is interesting to know that\r\nRidley instructed him in Greek, it is even more attractive to learn\r\nthat the future bishop also initiated him into the mysteries of tennis\r\nand archery. Turner did well at the university, for he was elected\r\nJunior Fellow of his college in 1531 and Joint Treasurer in 1532, and\r\nhe had a title for Orders in 1537. Throughout his life he was a\r\nstaunch Protestant and at Cambridge he used to attend the preachings\r\nof Hugh Latimer. We do not know how long Turner held his fellowship,\r\npossibly till his marriage with Jane, daughter of George Ander,\r\nAlderman of Cambridge. He left Cambridge in 1540 and travelled about,\r\npreaching in various places. In Wood's _Athenæ Oxonienses_ we read,\r\n\"In his rambles he settled for a time in Oxon among several of his\r\ncountrymen that he found there, purposely for the conversation of men\r\nand books.... At the same time and after, following his old trade of\r\npreaching without a call, he was imprisoned for a considerable\r\ntime.\"[60] On his release he left England and travelled in Italy,\r\nGermany and Holland. He tells us in his herbal that he visited\r\nCremona, Como, Milan, Venice and Chiavenna, and at Bologna[61] he\r\nstudied botany under Luca Ghini. Either there or at Ferrara he took\r\nhis M.D. degree. From Italy he went to Zurich, where he formed his\r\nintimate and lifelong friendship with Conrad Gesner,[62] the famous\r\nSwiss naturalist.\r\n\r\nHe subsequently visited Basle and Cologne, and it was in these two\r\ncities that his small religious books upholding the Protestant cause\r\nwere printed. They were very popular in England, so much so that in\r\nthe last year of Henry VIII.'s reign they were prohibited. Turner\r\nspent some time botanising in the Rhine country: in his herbal he\r\nspeaks of different plants which he collected at Bonn, Basel, Bingen,\r\nCologne, \"Erenffelde\" and \"Sieburg.\" Then he went to Holland and East\r\nFriesland--the latter he frequently mentions--and became physician to\r\nthe \"Erle of Emden.\" It was probably at this time that he explored the\r\nislands off the mainland. He was in correspondence with \"Maister Riche\r\nand maister Morgan, Apotecaries of London,\" two names which, it is\r\ninteresting to note, occur also in de l'Obel's works and in Gerard's\r\nHerbal.\r\n\r\nTurner wrote the first part of his Herbal when he was abroad, but he\r\ndelayed publication until the conclusion of his wanderings. On his\r\nreturn to England he became chaplain and physician to the Duke of\r\nSomerset, and it is generally believed that he sat in the House of\r\nCommons.[63] He was promised the prebend of Botevant in York, and in a\r\nletter written to thank Cecil for the promise we find the remark, \"My\r\nchylder have bene fed so long with hope that they are very leane, i\r\nwold fayne have th[=e] fatter if it were possible.\"\r\n\r\nTurner held this appointment for little more than two years, and after\r\nfailing to obtain either the provostship of Oriel College, Oxford, or\r\nthe presidency of Magdalen, he seems to have become despondent. He\r\nwanted a house \"where i may studie in and have s[=u] place to lay my\r\nbookes in,\" and in another letter he complains of \"being pened up in a\r\nchamber with all my ho[use] holde seruantes and children as shepe in a\r\npyndfolde.... i can not go to my booke for ye crying of childer and\r\nnoyse yt is made in my chamber.\" Finally he begged leave to go abroad,\r\n\"where I will also finishe my great herball and my bookes of fishes,\r\nstones and metalles if God send me lyfe and helthe.\" He was\r\nsubsequently made Dean of Wells, but he lost this office on the\r\naccession of Mary, and, like so many of the Protestant divines, he\r\nwent abroad. He stayed at Bonn, Frankfort, Freiburg, Lauterburg [?\r\nLauenburg], Mainz, Rodekirche, Strasburg, Speyer, Worms, Cologne and\r\nWeissenburg. At Cologne and Weissenburg he had gardens, and it was\r\nfrom Cologne that he published the second part of his Herbal. His\r\nworks were proclaimed heretical for the second time in 1555, and the\r\nWardens of every Company had to give notice of any copy they had in\r\norder that they might be destroyed. It is not surprising that Turner's\r\nworks are rare!\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Elizabeth he returned to England and was\r\nreinstated in the deanery of Wells.[64] His diocesan seems to have\r\nfound him troublesome, for in 1559 the Bishop of Bath and Wells wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"I am much encombred with mr. Doctor Turner Deane of Welles\r\n    for his indiscreete behavior in the pulpit where he medleth\r\n    w{th} all matters.... I have advertised him by wrytynges and\r\n    have admonished secretly by his owne frendes:\r\n    notwithstanding he persisteth still in his follie: he\r\n    conte[=n]eth all Bishopps and calleth th[=e] white coats,\r\n    typpett gentlem[=e], with other wordes of reproche [mu]che\r\n    more unsemlie and asketh 'who gave them autoritie more ouer\r\n    me then I ouer them'?\r\n\r\n                                        \"GILBERT BATH AND WELLS.\"\r\n      _January 24,\r\n        1559-60._\r\n\r\nThere is a story told that Turner trained his dog at a given sign to\r\nsnatch the bishop's square cap off his head when the prelate was\r\ndining with him. If this is true, possibly it accounts for the fact\r\nthat he was subsequently suspended for Nonconformity, after which,\r\nbeing precluded from clerical duties, he left Wells and returned to\r\nLondon. He lived in Crutched Friars and, like the two other\r\nElizabethan herbalists, had a famous garden. He was in failing health\r\nwhen he completed his herbal, and there is extant a pathetic letter\r\n(the greater part of it written by an amanuensis) to his staunch\r\npatron Lord Burleigh, which is signed \"Your old and seikly client\r\n\r\n                                   wllm turner doctor of physic.\"\r\n\r\nTurner died in 1568, and was buried in S. Olave's, Crutched Friars,\r\nwhere the tablet to his memory can still be seen.\r\n\r\n    CLARISSIMO . DOCTISSIMO . FORTISSIMOQUE . VIRO | GULIELMO .\r\n\r\n    TURNERO . MEDICO . AC . THEOLOGICO .

There is\r\nsomething very naïve and charming about Peter's admiration for his\r\nfather's \"fame and estimation.\" He tells us that he has diligently\r\ncompared the printed book with his father's \"owne hande copie,\" and\r\nrefrains from having the whole book printed again because \"I should\r\nhave done against Charitie to have caused the Printer by that meanes\r\nto lose all his labor and cost which he hath bestowed in printing\r\nhereof. Wherefore, gentle Reader, beare a little with the Printer that\r\nnever was much accustomed to the printing of Englishe and afore thou\r\nreade over this booke correct it as I haue appointed and then the\r\nprofit thereof will abundantly recompense thy paynes. In the meane\r\ntime vse this Herbale in stede of a better and give all laude and\r\nprayse unto the Lorde.\"\r\n\r\nTurner was the first Englishman who studied plants scientifically, and\r\nhis herbal marks the beginning of the science of botany in England.\r\nLike most writers of any value, he impressed his personality upon his\r\nbooks, and these show him to have been a man of indomitable character,\r\ncaustic wit and independent thought. \"Vir solidae eruditionis judicii\"\r\nhe is called by John Ray. His first botanical work was the _Libellus\r\nde re herbaria novus_ (1538), printed by John Byddell in London. This\r\nlittle book is particularly interesting, because it is the first in\r\nwhich localities of native British plants are given. In 1548 he\r\npublished another small book entitled _The names of herbes in Greke,\r\nLatin, Englishe, Duche, and Frenche wyth the commone names that\r\nHerbaries and Apotecaries use, gathered by William Turner_. In the\r\npreface he tells us that he had begun to \"set furth an herbal in\r\nlatyn,\" but that when he asked the advice of physicians, \"their advise\r\nwas that I shoulde cease from settynge out of this boke in latin till\r\nI had sene those places of Englande, wherein is moste plentie of\r\nherbes, that I might in my herbal declare to the greate honoure of our\r\ncountre what numbre of sovereine and strang herbes were in England,\r\nthat were not in other nations, whose counsell I have folowed,\r\ndeferrying to set out my herbal in latyn, tyl that I have sene the\r\nwest countrey, which I never sawe yet in al my lyfe, which countrey of\r\nal places of England, as I heare say, is moste richely replenished\r\nwyth al kindes of straunge and wonderfull workes and giftes of nature\r\nas are stones, herbes, fishes and metalles, when as they that moued\r\nme to the settyng furth of my latin herbal, hearde this so reasonable\r\nan excuse, they moved me to set out an herbal in Englishe as Fuchsius\r\ndyd in latine wyth the discriptions, figures and properties of as many\r\nherbes, as I had sene and knewe, to whom I could make no other answere\r\nbut that I had no such leasure in this vocation and place that I am\r\nnowe in, as is neccessary for a man that shoulde take in hande suche\r\nan interprise. But thys excuse coulde not be admitted for both\r\ncerteine scholars, poticaries, and also surgeons, required of me if\r\nthat I woulde not set furth my latin herbal, before I have sene the\r\nwest partes, and have no leasure in thys place and vocation to write\r\nso great a worke, at the least to set furth my judgement of the names\r\nof so many herbes as I knew, whose request I have accomplished, and\r\nhave made a litle boke, which is no more but a table or regestre of\r\nsuche bokes as I intende by the grace of God to set furth hereafter;\r\nif that I may obteine by your graces healp such libertie and leasure\r\nwith convenient place, as shall be necessary for suche a purpose.\"\r\n\r\nTurner's notable work, his Herbal, is the only original work on botany\r\nwritten by any Englishman in the sixteenth century. The first part of\r\nit was printed in London by Steven Mierdman, a Protestant refugee from\r\nAntwerp, in 1551. The second part was printed by Arnold Birckman, at\r\nCologne, in 1561, during Turner's enforced exile. Birckman also\r\nprinted the edition of 1568, which contained all three parts. (For the\r\nfull title, etc., see Bibliography of Herbals, p. 208.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most attractive features of this Herbal is the number of\r\nbeautiful woodcuts with which it is illustrated. A few were specially\r\ndrawn and cut for the author, but the great majority are reproductions\r\nof the exquisite drawings in Fuchs's herbals (_De historia Stirpium_,\r\n1545; and _Neue Kreüterbuch_, 1543). Nearly all the illustrations in\r\nthe famous sixteenth-century Flemish, English and Swiss herbals were\r\nprinted from the actual wood-blocks or copied from the illustrations\r\nin Fuchs's works. Notably in Hieronymus Bock's _Kreüter Buch_ (1546),\r\nRembert Dodoens's _Cruÿdtboeck_ (1554), Henry Lyte's _Niewe Herball_\r\n(1578), and Jean Bauhin's _Historia plantarum universalis_ (1651). It\r\nis a remarkable fact that so far as wood-engraving is concerned this\r\ncountry has contributed nothing to the art of plant illustration. In\r\nthe first English illustrated Herbal, the _Grete Herball_ of 1526, the\r\nfigures are merely copies of the inferior cuts in the later editions\r\nof the _Herbarius zu Teutsch_, and, with the exception of Parkinson's\r\n_Paradisus_, all the English sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century\r\nherbals borrowed their illustrations from Flemish or German sources.\r\nFuchs had two sets of blocks for his Herbal, one for the folio edition\r\nof 1542 and the other for the octavo edition of 1545. It was the\r\nblocks for the latter which were borrowed by Turner's printer, and it\r\nhas been suggested that it was his desire to secure these beautiful\r\nillustrations which led him to have his herbal printed at Cologne.[66]\r\nOver 400 of Fuchs's blocks were used in the complete edition of\r\nTurner's Herbal, and, of the rest, some are copied from the smaller\r\nfigures in Mattioli's[67] commentary on Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nTurner dedicated the first part of his Herbal (1551) to the Duke of\r\nSomerset, uncle to Edward VI., and at that time Lord Protector. The\r\npreface is delightful and I quote a part of it:--\r\n\r\n    \"To the mighty and christiane Prince Edward, Duke of\r\n    Summerset, Erle of Herford, Lorde Beauchampe, and Uncle unto\r\n    the Kynges maiesty, Wyllyam Turner his servant wysheth\r\n    increase in the knowledge of Goddes holy worde and grace to\r\n    lyue thereafter. Although (most myghty and Christian Prince)\r\n    there be many noble and excellent actes and sciences, which\r\n    no man douteth but that almyghty God, the author of all\r\n    goodness, hath gyuen unto us by the hands of the Hethen, as\r\n    necessary unto the use of Mankynd: yet is there none among\r\n    them all, whych is so openly c[=o]mended by the verdit of\r\n    any holy writer in the Bible, as is ye knowledge of plantes,\r\n    herbes, and trees and of Phisick. I do not remembre that I\r\n    have red anye expressed commendations of Grammer, Logick,\r\n    Philosophie, naturall or morall, Astronomie, Arithmetyke,\r\n    Geometry, Cosmographie, Musycke, Perspectiue or any other\r\n    such lyke science. But I rede amonge the commendatyons and\r\n    prayses of Kyng Salomon, that he was sene in herbes shrubbes\r\n    and trees and so perfectly that he disputed wysely of them\r\n    from the hyghest to the lowest, that is from the Cedre tre\r\n    in Mount Liban unto the Hysop that groweth furth of the\r\n    wall. If the Knowledge of Herbes, shrubbes and trees which\r\n    is not the lest necessary thynge unto the knowledge of\r\n    Phisicke were not greatly commendable it shulde never have\r\n    bene set among Salomon's commendacyons and amongst the\r\n    singular giftes of God. Therefor whereas Salomon was\r\n    commended for the Knowledge of Herbes the same Knowledge was\r\n    expressedly ynough co[=m]ended there also.\" Continuing, he\r\n    speaks of learned Englishmen \"Doctor Clement, Doctor Wendy\r\n    and Doctor Owen, Doctor Wolton and Maister Falconer\"[68]\r\n    which \"have as much knowledge in herbes yea and more than\r\n    diuerse Italianes and Germanes whyche have set forth in\r\n    prynte Herballes and bokes of simples. Yet hath none of al\r\n    these set furth any thyng other to the generall profit of\r\n    hole Christendome in latin and to the honor of thys realme,\r\n    nether in Englysh to the proper profit of their naturall\r\n    countre.\" After slyly observing that perhaps they do not\r\n    care to jeopardise their estimation, he compares himself,\r\n    for having ventured to write this book, with the soldier\r\n    \"who is more frendly unto the commonwealth, which\r\n    adventurously runneth among the myddes of hys enemyes, both\r\n    gyuyng and takyng blowes, then he that, whilse other men\r\n    feight, standeth in the top of a tre iudging how other men\r\n    do, he beynge without the danger of gonne shot himself.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who may object that it is too small, he explains that he will\r\nwrite more fully when he has \"travelled diverse shyres in England to\r\nlearn more of the herbs that grow there.\" Others may condemn him for\r\nwriting in English, \"for now (say they) every man without any study of\r\nnecessary artes unto the knowledge of Phisick will become a Phisician\r\n... euery man nay euery old wyfe will presume, not without the mordre\r\nof many, to practyse Phisick.\" To these he succinctly replies, \"How\r\nmany surgianes and apothecaries are there in England which can\r\nunderstand Plini in Latin or Galen and Dioscorides?\" The English\r\nphysicians, he says, rely on the apothecaries, and they in turn on the\r\nold wives who gather the herbs. Moreover, since the physicians are not\r\npresent when their prescriptions are made up, \"many a good m[=a] by\r\nignorance is put in jeopardy of his life, or good medecine is marred\r\nto the great dishonesty both of the Phisician and of Goddes worthy\r\ncreatures.\" All this can be avoided by having a herbal written in\r\nEnglish. Dioscorides and Galen, he points out, wrote in their native\r\ntongue, Greek. \"Dyd Dioscorides and Galen give occasion for every old\r\nwyfe to take in h[=a]d the practise of Phisick? Did they giue any iust\r\noccasion of murther? If they gaue no occasyon unto every old wyfe to\r\npractise physike then give I none. If they gave no occasion of murther\r\nthen gyue I none ... then am I no hynderer wryting unto the English my\r\ncountremen an English herball.\"\r\n\r\nThe second part of Turner's Herbal is dedicated to his old patron,\r\nThomas Lord Wentworth, and the complete work, including the third\r\npart, to Queen Elizabeth.[69] In the preface to this last he reminds\r\nthe queen of a conversation he had had with her in Latin eighteen\r\nyears before, at the Duke of Somerset's house, when he was physician\r\nto that nobleman. It is in this preface also that he criticises the\r\nforeign herbalists; though he has learnt much from them, they had much\r\nto learn from him, \"as their second editions maye testifye.\" He claims\r\nthat in the first part of his herbal he taught \"the truth of certeyne\r\nplants which these above-named writers (Matthiolus, Fuchsius, Tragus\r\nand Dodoneus) either knew not at al or ellis erred in them\r\ngreatlye.... And because I would not be lyke unto a cryer yt cryeth a\r\nloste horse in the marketh, and telleth all the markes and tokens that\r\nhe hath, and yet never sawe the horse, nether coulde knowe the horse\r\nif he sawe him: I wente into Italye and into diverse partes of\r\nGermany, to knowe and se the herbes my selfe.\"\r\n\r\nThe book owes much of its charm to its vivid descriptions of the\r\nplants, and the fascinating and unexpected details he gives us about\r\nthem. The comparison of dodder, for instance, to \"a great red harpe\r\nstrynge,\" is a happy touch which it is impossible to forget. \"Doder\r\ngroweth out of herbes and small bushes as miscelto groweth out of\r\ntrees. Doder is lyke a great red harpe strynge and it wyndeth about\r\nherbes foldyng mych about them and hath floures and knoppes one from\r\nan other a good space.... The herbes that I have marked doder to growe\r\nmost in are flax and tares.\"\r\n\r\nThese accurate observations and careful descriptions are\r\ncharacteristic of the writer, and recall similar touches in the Saxon\r\nherbals. For example, he records that the stamens of the Madonna lily\r\nhave a different smell from the flower itself, and that the berries of\r\nthe bay tree are almost, but not quite, round. There is only space to\r\nquote the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"The lily hath a long stalk and seldom more than one,\r\n    howbeit it hath somtyme II. It is II or III cubites hyghe.\r\n    It hath long leves and somthyng of the fashion of the great\r\n    satyrion. The flour is excedyng white and it hath the forme\r\n    or fashion of a long quiver, that is to say, smal at the\r\n    one end and byg at the other. The leves of the floures are\r\n    full of crestes, and the overmost ends of the leves bowe a\r\n    little backwarde and from the lowest parte within come forth\r\n    long small yelow thynges lyke thredes of another smelle than\r\n    the floures are of. The roote is round and one pece groweth\r\n    hard to another allmoste after the maner of the roote of\r\n    Garleke, but that the clowes in the lily are broder.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The leaves of the Bay tree are alwayes grene and in figure\r\n    and fashion they are lyke unto periwincle. They are long and\r\n    brodest in the middest of the lefe. They are blackishe grene\r\n    namely when they are olde. They are curled about the edges,\r\n    they smell well. And when they are casten into the fyre they\r\n    crake wonderfully. The tre in England is no great tre, but\r\n    it thryveth there many partes better and is lustier than in\r\n    Germany. The berries are allmoste round but not altogether.\r\n    The kirnell is covered with a thick black barke which may\r\n    well be parted from the kirnell.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Blewbottel groweth in ye corne, it hath a stalke full of\r\n    corners, a narrow and long leefe. In the top of the stalke\r\n    is a knoppy head whereupon growe bleweflowers about\r\n    midsummer. The chylder use to make garlandes of the floure.\r\n    It groweth much amonge Rye wherefore I thinke that good ry\r\n    in an evell and unseasonable yere doth go out of kinde in to\r\n    this wede.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Pennyroyal.--It crepeth much upon the ground and hath many\r\n    lytle round leves not unlyke unto the leves of merierum\r\n    gentil but that they are a little longer and sharper and\r\n    also litle indented rounde about, and grener than the leves\r\n    of meriurum ar. The leves grow in litle branches even from\r\n    the roote of certayn ioyntes by equall spaces one devyded\r\n    from an other. Where as the leves grow in litle tuftes upon\r\n    the over partes of the braunches.... Pennyroyal groweth\r\n    much, without any setting, besyd hundsley [Hounslow] upon\r\n    the heth beside a watery place.\"\r\n\r\n    Of camomile he writes: \"It hath floures wonderfully\r\n    shynynge yellow and resemblynge the appell of an eye ... the\r\n    herbe may be called in English, golden floure. It will\r\n    restore a man to hys color shortly yf a man after the longe\r\n    use of the bathe drynke of it after he is come forthe oute\r\n    of the bath. This herbe is scarce in Germany but in England\r\n    it is so plenteous that it groweth not only in gardynes but\r\n    also VIII mile above London, it groweth in the wylde felde,\r\n    in Rychmonde grene, in Brantfurde grene.... Thys herb was\r\n    consecrated by the wyse men of Egypt unto the sonne and was\r\n    rekened to be the only remedy of all agues.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike modern authorities, Turner contends that our English hyssop is\r\nthe same plant as that mentioned in the Bible, and he also describes a\r\nspecies which does not now exist. \"We have in Sumershire beside ye\r\nc[=o]m[=e] Hysop that groweth in all other places of Englande a kinde\r\nof Hysop that is al roughe and hory and it is greater muche and\r\nstronger then the c[=o]men Hysop is, som call it rough Hysop.\" Another\r\nplant which seems to have disappeared and which, he states, no other\r\nwriter describes, is \"the wonderful great cole with leaves thrise as\r\nthike as ever I saw any other cole have. It hath whyte floures and\r\nround berryes lyke yvy. This herbe groweth at douer harde by the\r\nSea-syde. I name it the Douer cole because I founde it first besyde\r\nDouer.\" Incidentally he mentions samphire also as growing at Dover.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that Turner identifies the _Herba\r\nBritannica_ of Dioscorides and Pliny (famed for having cured the\r\nsoldiers of Julius Cæsar of scurvy in the Rhine country) with\r\n_Polygonum bistorta_, which he observed plentifully in Friesland, the\r\nscene of Pliny's observations. This herb is held by more modern\r\nauthorities to be _Rumex aquations_ (great water dock).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS FROM TURNER'S \"HERBAL\"]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Herbal there are recollections of the north of England,\r\nwhere the author spent his boyhood. Of heath, for instance, he tells\r\nus: \"The hyest hethe that ever I saw groweth in Northumberland,\r\nwhich is so hyghe that a man may hyde himself in.\" Of the wild\r\nhyacinth he writes: \"The boyes in North[=u]berland scrape the roote of\r\nthe herbe and glew theyr arrowes and bokes wyth that slyme that they\r\nscrape of.\" Of sea-wrake (seaweed) he tells us: \"In the Bishopriche of\r\nDurham the housbandmen of the countie that dwel by the sea syde use to\r\nfate [fatten, _i. e._ manure] their lande with seawrake.\" Under\r\n\"birch\" we find: \"Fisherers in Northumberland pyll off the uttermost\r\nbarke and put it in the clyft of a sticke and set in fyre and hold it\r\nat the water syde and make fish come thether, whiche if they se they\r\nstryke with theyr leysters or sammon speres. The same,\" he continues,\r\n\"is good to make hoopes of and twigges for baskettes, it is so\r\nbowinge. It serveth for many good uses and for none better then for\r\nbetinge of stubborne boyes that ether lye or will not learne.\"\r\n\r\nCudweed \"is called in Northumberland chafwede because it is thought to\r\nbe good for chafyng of any man's fleshe wyth goynge or rydynge.\" And\r\nit would be interesting to know if the daisy is still called banwurt\r\nin the north. \"The Northern men call thys herbe banwurt because it\r\nhelpeth bones to knyt agayne.... Plinie writeth that the dasey hath\r\nIII and sometimes IV little whyte leves whiche go about the yelow\r\nknope, it appereth that the double Daseys were not founde in plinies\r\ntyme whych have a greate dele mo then Plini maketh mention of.\"\r\n\r\nThere are other country customs which he records. \"Shepherds use\r\nclivers [goosegrass] in stede of a strayner to pull out here of the\r\nmylke;\" \"birderers [bird-catchers] take bowes of birch and lime the\r\ntwigges and go a bat folinge with them;\" \"som make a lee [lye] or an\r\nashy water of the rotes of gentian wherwyth they toke out spottes very\r\nwell out of cloth.\" He mentions woad as \"trimmed wyth mannes labor in\r\ndyenge and wull and clothe,\" and teazle \"which the fullers dresse\r\ntheir cloth wtall.\" Apparently Turner gave the spindle tree its name,\r\nfor he says: \"I coulde never learne an Englishe name for it. The\r\nDuche men call it in Netherlande, spilboome, that is, spindel tree,\r\nbecause they use to make spindels of it in that countrey, and me\r\nthynke it maye be so well named in English seying we have no other\r\nname.... I know no good propertie that this tree hath, saving only it\r\nis good to make spindels and brid of cages\" [bird cages].\r\n\r\nThe use of complexion washes was a custom on which Turner was\r\nalarmingly severe. There are fewer beauty recipes in his herbal than\r\nin any other--only four altogether. \"Some weomen,\" we find, \"sprinkle\r\nye floures of cowslip w{t} whyte wine and after still it and wash\r\ntheir faces w{t} that water to drive wrinkles away and to make them\r\nfayre in the eyes of the worlde rather then in the eyes of God, whom\r\nthey are not afrayd to offend.\" And of marygold we learn that \"Summe\r\nuse to make theyr here yelow with the floure of this herbe, not beyng\r\ncont[=e]t with the naturall colour which God hath geven th[=e].\"\r\n\r\nThere is curiously little folk lore in this herbal, and most of it is\r\nguarded by \"some do say\" or \"some hold.\" Nevertheless, with this\r\nqualification, Turner gives us fragments of folk lore not to be found\r\nin other herbals. For instance, that nutshells burnt and bound to the\r\nback of a child's head will make grey eyes black, and that parsley\r\nthrown into fish ponds will heal the sick fishes therein. Again, this\r\nis the first herbal in which any account is to be found of the very\r\nold custom of curing disease in cattle by boring a hole in the ear and\r\ninserting the herb bearfoot.[70]\r\n\r\n\"They say it should be used thus. The brodest part of the ear must\r\nhave a round circle made about it w{t} the blood that rinneth furth\r\nwith a brasen botken and the same circle must be round lyke unto the\r\nletter O, and when this is done without and in the higher part of the\r\near the halfe of the foresaid circle is to be bored thorowe with the\r\nforesaid botken and the roote of the herbe is to be put in at the\r\nhole, when y{t} newe wounde that hath receyued it holdeth it so fast,\r\nthat it will not let it go furth, then all the mighte and pestilent\r\npoison of the disease is brought so into the eare. And whilse the part\r\nwhich is circled aboute dyeth and falleth awaye y{t} hole beast is\r\nsaved with the lose of a very small parte.\"\r\n\r\nAnother piece of folk lore is remarkable because it is the only\r\ninstance in an English herbal of a belief in the effect of a human\r\nbeing on a plant: \"If ye woulde fayne have very large and greate\r\ngourdes, then take sedes that growe there [in the sides].... And let\r\nweomen nether touche the yonge gourdes nor loke upon them, for the\r\nonly touchinge and sighte of weomen kille the yonge gourdes.\" This\r\nbelief he quotes from Pliny.\r\n\r\nTurner, again, is the only old herbalist who refers to the old and\r\nwidespread belief that larch was fire-proof. It was largely used, he\r\ntells us, for laying under the tiles of newly-built houses, as \"a sure\r\ndefence against burning,\" and he narrates at length how Julius Cæsar\r\nwas unable to burn a tower built with larch. On the old mandrake\r\nlegend he is scathing. \"The rootes which are counterfited and made\r\nlike litle puppettes and mammettes which come to be sold in England in\r\nboxes with heir [hair] and such forme as man hath, are nothyng elles\r\nbut folishe fened trifles and not naturall. For they are so trymmed of\r\ncrafty theves to mocke the poore people withall and to rob them both\r\nof theyr wit and theyr money. I have in my tyme at diverse tymes\r\ntak[=e] up the rootes of mandrake out of the grounde but I never saw\r\nany such thyng upon or in them as are in and upon the pedlers rootes\r\nthat are comenly to be solde in boxes. It groweth not under galloses\r\n[gallows] as a certayn doting doctor of Colon in his physick lecture\r\ndyd teach hys auditors.\" But he accepts without question the belief in\r\nits efficacy as an anæsthetic: \"It is given to those who must be\r\nburned or cut in some place that they should not fele the burning or\r\ncuttyng.\" Of wine made of it, he says: \"If they drynk thys drynke they\r\nshall fele no payne, but they shall fall into a forgetfull and\r\nslepishe drowsiness. Of the apples of mandrake, if a man smell of them\r\nthei will make hym slepe and also if they be eaten. But they that\r\nsmell to muche of the apples become dum ... thys herbe diverse wayes\r\ntaken is very jepardus for a man and may kill hym if he eat it or\r\ndrynk it out of measure and have no remedy from it.... If mandragora\r\nbe taken out of measure by and by slepe ensueth and a great lousing of\r\nthe streyngthe with a forgetfulness.\"\r\n\r\nTurner is one of the few herbalists who cautions against the excessive\r\nuse of any herb. \"Onions eaten in meat largely make the head ake, they\r\nmake them forgetfull whiche in the tyme of syknes use them out of\r\nmesure.\" \"Cole engendreth euell and melancholie juice. It dulleth the\r\nsyght and it troubleth the slepe wyth contrary thynges which are sene\r\nin the dreme.\" Of nigella he writes: \"Take hede that ye take not to\r\nmuche of this herbe, for if ye go beyonde the mesure it bryngeth\r\ndeth.\" \"Hemp seed,\" he says, \"if it be taken out of measure taketh\r\nmen's wyttes from th[=e] as coriander doth.\" \"If any person use\r\nsaffron measurably it maketh in them a good colour, but if thei use it\r\nout of mesure it maketh hym loke pale, and maketh the hede ache and\r\nhurteth the appetite.\" For those who have taken an overdose of opium\r\nthere is a surprising remedy. \"If the pacient be to much slepi put\r\nstynkynge thynges unto hys nose to waken hym therewith.\" As in all\r\nherbals of this period, there are an astonishing number of remedies\r\nagainst melancholy and suggestions for those whose weak brains will\r\nnot stand much strong drink; but, while remedies for broken heads, so\r\ncommon in the older herbals, are conspicuously absent, we find that\r\nwalnuts are recommended \"for the bytings both of men and dogges\"!\r\n\r\nAs in the _Grete Herball_, there are many descriptions of other\r\nsubstances besides herbs, some of the longest being of dates, rice,\r\nolives, citron, pomegranates and lentils. The account of citron it\r\nwould be pleasant to transcribe in full, not for the sake of the story\r\nbut for the manner of the telling. One could listen to a sermon of\r\nconsiderable length from a divine who, in a book intended for\r\ngrown-ups, has a tale of \"two naughty murthering robbers, condemned\r\nfor theyr murder and robery to be flayn and poysoned to deth of\r\nserpentes, and such venemous bestes,\" and of the one who, owing to\r\nhaving eaten \"a pece of citron,\" remained, Daniel-like, unhurt by the\r\npoison of the snakes, whilst the other who had not taken this\r\nprecaution \"fell down sterk dede.\" And finally, the moral--\"Wherefore\r\nit were wisdome that noblemen and other that are bydden to dynner of\r\ntheyr enemies or suspected frendes before they eat any other thyng\r\nshould take a pece of citron.\"\r\n\r\nThe later sixteenth-century herbalists owed much to the famous\r\nherbalists of the Netherlands, and above all to that prince amongst\r\npublishers, Christophe Plantin of Antwerp, whose personality secured\r\nhim a unique place in the literary world. Indeed, there is a splendour\r\nabout the works of the Flemish herbalists unequalled by any others of\r\nthis period, with the exception of the Bavarian doctor Leonhard Fuchs.\r\nThere is no comparison between them and the Italian herbalists of the\r\nRenaissance, who, for the greater part, devoted themselves to studying\r\nthe classical writers and identifying the plants mentioned by the old\r\nauthorities. France, curiously enough, contributed comparatively\r\nlittle when the herbal was at its zenith, though it must of course be\r\nremembered that the Bauhins, who rank as Swiss herbalists, were of\r\nFrench extraction. But it is difficult to estimate the influence of\r\nthe works of those three notable friends, Rembert Dodoens, Charles de\r\nl'Escluse and Matthias de l'Obel, particularly on the English\r\nherbalists. The most famous English herbal--Gerard's--is virtually a\r\ntranslation of the _Pemptades_ of Dodoens. Lyte's translation of the\r\n_Cruÿdtboeck_ was the standard work on herbs during the latter part of\r\nthe century, and Parkinson incorporated a large part of de l'Obel's\r\nunfinished book in his _Theatrum Botanicum_.\r\n\r\nDe l'Obel, after whom the little garden flower--lobelia--is named,\r\nspent the greater part of his life in England. He was a Fleming by\r\nbirth and a doctor by profession,[71] and he was physician to William\r\nthe Silent until his assassination. About 1569 he came over to England\r\n(with his friend Pena, who at one time was physician to Louis XIII.)\r\nand lived at Highgate with his son-in-law. He superintended Lord\r\nZouche's garden at Hackney, and later was given the title of botanist\r\nto James I. L'Obel's great work, written in collaboration with Pena,\r\nwas the _Stirpium Adversaria Nova_, printed in London by Thomas\r\nPurfoot in 1571.[72] Pulteney, in his _Biographical Sketches_ (1790),\r\nmakes the extraordinary statement that Christophe Plantin of Antwerp\r\nwas the real printer. It has, however, been pointed out by modern\r\nauthorities that the archives of the Plantin Museum show that Plantin\r\nbought 800 copies of Purfoot's edition, with the wood blocks, for 1320\r\nflorins. In 1576 Plantin published de l'Obel's _Plantarum seu Stirpium\r\nhistoria_, and to this he appended the first part of the _Adversaria_,\r\nkeeping Purfoot's original colophon.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dodoens neither lived in England nor had any of his works\r\nprinted here, his _Cruÿdtboeck_ became one of the standard works in\r\nthis country through Lyte's translation. Dodoens was born at Malines\r\nabout 1517 and, after studying at Louvain, visited the universities\r\nand medical schools of France, Italy and Germany, graduated M.D., and\r\nwas appointed physician to Maximilian II. and Rudolf II. successively.\r\nIn the latter part of his life he was Professor of Medicine at Leyden,\r\nwhere he died in 1585. Plantin published Dodoens's most important\r\nwork, _Stirpium historiæ pemptades sex sive libri triginta_, in which\r\nsome of the figures are copied from the fifth-century manuscript[73]\r\ncopy of Dioscorides. Dodoens's first book, the _Cruÿdtboeck_, was\r\ntranslated into French by his friend Charles de l'Escluse[74] and\r\nafterwards into English by Henry Lyte.\r\n\r\nLyte, who was an Oxford man, travelled extensively in his youth and\r\nmade a collection of rare plants. He contributed nothing original to\r\nthe literature on herbs, but his translation of the French version of\r\nthe _Cruÿdtboeck_ was an inestimable service. His own copy of the\r\nFrench version, which is now in the British Museum, has on the\r\ntitle-page the quaint inscription \"Henry Lyte taught me to speake\r\nEnglishe.\" The book is full of MS. notes and references to Turner.\r\n\r\nThe full title of Lyte's book is as follows: \"A niewe Herball or\r\nHistorie of Plantes: wherein is contayned the whole discourse and\r\nperfect description of all sortes of Herbes and Plantes: their divers\r\nand sundry kindes: their straunge Figures, Fashions and Shapes: their\r\nNames, Natures, Operations, and Vertues: and that not only of those\r\nwhich are here growyng in this our Countrie of Englande but of all\r\nothers also of forrayne Realmes, commonly used in Physicke. First set\r\nfoorth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue by that learned D. Rembert\r\nDodoens, Physition to the Emperour: And nowe first translated out of\r\nFrench into English by Henry Lyte Esquyer.\"\r\n\r\n(_Colophon._) \"Imprinted at Antwerpe by Me Henry Loë Booke printer and\r\nare to be solde at London in Paul's churchyarde by Gerard Dewes.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful illustrations in Lyte's _Dodoens_ are to a large extent\r\nprinted from the same blocks as those in the octavo edition (1545) of\r\nFuchs. In Fuchs there are about 516 illustrations, and in Lyte's\r\n_Dodoens_ about 870. Those which are not copied from Fuchs were\r\nprobably collected by Dodoens himself, who, according to some verses\r\nat the beginning of the herbal, took a practical interest in the\r\npublication of the English translation of his book.\r\n\r\n    \"Till Rembert he did sende additions store,\r\n    For to augment Lyte's travell past before.\"\r\n\r\nThe original wood-blocks never came to England, and three years later\r\nvan der Loë's widow sold them to Christophe Plantin for 420 florins.\r\n\r\nAll the commendatory verses at the beginning of Lyte's herbal are in\r\nLatin, except some lines in which William Clowes speaks of writing\r\nabout herbs as \"a fit occupation for gentlemen and wights of worthy\r\nfame,\" and recalls the great men who have immortalised themselves\r\nthereby, notably Gentius, Lysimachus, Mythridates and Dioscorides.\r\nThen, after giving due praise to Dodoens, \"Whose learned skill hath\r\noffered first this worthy worke to vewe,\" Clowes ends with four lines\r\nin which he plays upon the name of the translator:\r\n\r\n    \"And Lyte, whose toyle hath not bene light to dye it in this grayne,\r\n    Deserves no light regarde of us: but thankes and thankes agayne.\r\n    And sure I am all English hartes that lyke of Physickes lore\r\n    Will also lyke this gentleman: and thanke hym muche therefore.\"\r\n\r\nThe herbal is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth \"as the best token of love\r\nand diligence that I am at this time able to shew.... And doubtless if\r\nmy skill in the translation were answerable to the worthynesse eyther\r\nof the Historie itselfe or of the Authours thereof I doubt not but I\r\nshould be thought to haue honoured your Maiestie with an acceptable\r\npresent.\" The preface is dated from \"my poore house at Lytes carie\r\nwithin your Maiesties Countie of Somerset the first day of Januarie\r\nMDLXXVIII.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1606 there appeared the book commonly known as _Ram's little\r\nDodoen_. It purported to be an epitome of Lyte's _Dodoens_, but,\r\nthough some of its matter has been abridged from Dodoens's work, it is\r\nin reality a compilation of recipes unworthy of the great name it\r\nbears. In his preface the author tells us: \"I have bestowed some tyme\r\nin reducing the most exquisit new herball or history of plants (first\r\nset forth in Dutch and Almayne tongue by the learned and worthy man of\r\nfamous memory Dr. Rembert Dodeon (_sic_) Phisician to the Emperor, and\r\ntranslated into English by Master Henry Lyte Esq.), with a brief and\r\nshort epitome ... so as where the great booke at large is not to be\r\nhad but at a great price, which cannot be procured by the poorer\r\nsort, my endevor herein hath bin chiefly to make the benefit of so\r\ngood, necessary and profitable a worke to be brought within the reach\r\nand compasse as well of you my poore countrymen and women whose lives,\r\nhealths, ease and welfare is to be regarded with the rest, at a\r\nsmaller price than the great volume is. My onely and greatest care\r\nhath byn of long tyme to knowe or thinke how and upon whome to bestow\r\nthe dedication of this my small labour. And in the penning of this my\r\nletter my Affections are satisfied with the dedication thereof to\r\nthese my poore and loving countrymen whosoever and to whose hands\r\nsoever it may come. For whose sake I have desired publicati[=o] of the\r\nsame, beseeching Almighty God to blesse us all.\"\r\n\r\nThe book is curiously arranged, for on one page we have \"the practice\r\nof Dodoen,\" and on the opposite \"the practises of others for the same\r\nPhisike helpes, collected and presented to the Author of this\r\nTreatise.\" There are directions for each month, and each is headed by\r\na motto. The twelve mottoes, when read together, form the following\r\nquaint rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    \"January. With this fyre I warme my hand\r\n    February. With this spade I digge my land\r\n    March. Here I cut my Vine spring\r\n    April. Here I hear the birds sing\r\n    May. I am as fresh as bird on bough\r\n    June. Corn is weeded well enough\r\n    July. With this sithe my grasse I mowe\r\n    August. Here I cut my corne full lowe\r\n    September. With this flaile I earne my bread\r\n    October. Here I sowe my wheats so red\r\n    November. With this axe I kill my swine\r\n    December. And here I brew both ale and wine.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some things in this little handbook worthy of remembrance,\r\nnotably an imaginative passage in which the author tells us that\r\n\"herbs that grow in the fields are better than those which grow in\r\ngardens, and of those herbs which grow in the fieldes, such as grow on\r\nhilles are best.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] Then \"Marie Valence Hall.\" (Founded in 1347 by Marie widow of\r\nAylmer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke.)\r\n\r\n[60] It has been suggested that Turner was imprisoned for his refusal\r\nto subscribe to the Six Articles and that he recanted to save his\r\nlife. But, as Dr. B. D. Jackson has pointed out, Turner was made of\r\nsterner stuff and his whole life and writings are a standing\r\ncontradiction to any such supposition.\r\n\r\n[61] One of the earliest botanic gardens in Europe was at Bologna. It\r\nwas founded by Luca Ghini. It is interesting to see how frequently\r\nTurner in his herbal quotes Ghini, and cites his authority against\r\nother commentators. Luca Ghini was the first who erected a separate\r\nprofessorial chair at Bologna for Botanical Science. He himself\r\nlectured on Dioscorides for twenty-eight years. He was the preceptor\r\nof Caesalpinus and Anquillara, two of the soundest critics on\r\nbotanical writings of that age.\r\n\r\nThe most famous public botanical gardens in Europe during the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries were the\r\nfollowing. I give them in the order in which they were made:--\r\n\r\n    1533--Padua.\r\n    1544--Florence.\r\n    1547--Bologna.\r\n    1570--Paris.\r\n    1598--Montpellier.\r\n    1628--Jena.\r\n    1632--Oxford.\r\n    1637--Upsala.\r\n    1673--Chelsea.\r\n    1675--Edinburgh.\r\n    1677--Leyden.\r\n    1682--Amsterdam.\r\n    1725--Utrecht.\r\n\r\nThe first botanic garden in America was founded in Philadelphia by\r\nJohn Bartram, the great American botanist, in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[62] Gesner had a high opinion of Turner, of whom he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Ante annos 15, aut circiter cum Anglicus ex Italia rediens me\r\nsalutaret (Turnerus) is fuerit vir excellentis tum in re medica tum\r\naliis plerisque disciplinis doctrinae aut alius quisquam vix satis\r\nmemini.\"--_De Herbis Lunariis_, 1555.\r\n\r\n[63] The Duke of Somerset was himself keenly interested in botanical\r\ninvestigations, and Turner frequently refers to the Duke's garden. It\r\nwas during this time that Turner had his own garden at Kew. That he\r\nsat in the House of Commons is generally supposed from a passage in\r\nhis _Spiritual Physik_, and this view is sustained by the character of\r\nthe Hunter in his _Romish Wolfe_.\r\n\r\n[64] It has been asserted in some accounts of Turner that he was a\r\nCanon of Windsor, but this is a mistake. The Canon of Windsor was\r\nRichard Turner, also a Protestant, and, like the herbalist, exiled\r\nduring Mary's reign.\r\n\r\n[65] Turner's widow subsequently married Richard Cox, who became\r\nBishop of Ely. She founded a scholarship at Cambridge in memory of her\r\nfirst husband.\r\n\r\n[66] It was for the same reason that Henry Lyte's translation of\r\nDodoens was printed abroad.\r\n\r\n[67] Pierandrea Mattioli (1501-1577) was physician successively to the\r\nArchduke Ferdinand and to the Emperor Maximilian II. With the\r\nexception of Fabio Colonna he was the greatest of the Italian\r\nherbalists.\r\n\r\n[68] This was probably the John Falconer who sent English plants to\r\nAmatus Lusitanus, who taught physic at Ferrara and Ancona, and whose\r\ncommentary on Dioscorides was published in 1553.\r\n\r\n[69] Queen Elizabeth's love of gardening and her botanical knowledge\r\nwere celebrated in a long Latin poem by an Italian who visited England\r\nin 1586 and wrote under the name of Melissus (see _Archæologia_, VII.\r\n120).\r\n\r\n[70] Parkinson in his _Theatrum Botanicum_ also mentions this use of\r\nbearfoot.\r\n\r\n[71] He studied medicine at Montpelier under Guillaume Rondelet, who\r\nbequeathed him his botanical manuscripts. D'Aléchamps, Pena and Jean\r\nBauhin, all famous herbalists, were also pupils of Rondelet.\r\n\r\n[72] For full title see Bibliography of Herbals, p. 210.\r\n\r\n[73] This manuscript, now in the Vienna Library, was bought from a Jew\r\nin Constantinople for 100 ducats by Auger-Geslain Busbecq, when he was\r\non a mission to Turkey.\r\n\r\n[74] On one of his visits to England de l'Escluse met Sir Francis\r\nDrake, who gave him plants from the New World.\r\n\r\n[75] For subsequent editions see Bibliography of Herbals, p. 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGERARD'S HERBAL\r\n\r\n    \"If odours may worke satisfaction, they are so soveraigne in\r\n    plants and so comfortable that no confection of the\r\n    apothecaries can equall their excellent vertue.\"--_Gerard's\r\n    Herbal_, 1597.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one looks at the dingy, if picturesque, thoroughfare of Fetter\r\nLane it is difficult to realise that it was once the site of Gerard's\r\ngarden, and it is pleasant to remember that the city of London in\r\nthose far-off days was as noted for the beauty of its gardens as for\r\nits stately houses. The owner of this particular garden in Fetter Lane\r\nis the most famous of all the English herbalists. His Herbal,[76]\r\nwhich was published in 1597, gripped the imagination of the English\r\ngarden-loving world, and now, after the lapse of three hundred years,\r\nit still retains its hold on us. There are English-speaking people the\r\nworld over who may know nothing of any other, but at least by name\r\nthey know Gerard's Herbal. In spite of the condemnation he has justly\r\nearned, not only in modern times, but from the critics of his own day,\r\nfor having used Dr. Priest's translation of Dodoens's _Pemptades_\r\nwithout acknowledgment, no one can wander in the mazes of Gerard's\r\nmonumental book without succumbing to its fascination. One reads his\r\ncritics with the respect due to their superior learning, and then\r\nreturns to Gerard's Herbal with the comfortable sensation of slipping\r\naway from a boring sermon into the pleasant spaciousness of an\r\nold-fashioned fairy-tale. For the majority of us are not scientific,\r\nnor do we care very much about being instructed. What we like is to\r\nread about daffodils and violets and gilliflowers and rosemary and\r\nthyme and all the other delicious old-fashioned English flowers. And\r\nwhen we can read about them in the matchless Elizabethan English we\r\nask nothing more. Who that has read it once can forget those words in\r\nthe preface?--\r\n\r\n    \"What greater delight is there than to behold the earth\r\n    apparelled with plants as with a robe of embroidered works,\r\n    set with Orient pearls and garnished with great diversitie\r\n    of rare and costly jewels? But these delights are in the\r\n    outward senses. The principal delight is in the minde,\r\n    singularly enriched with the knowledge of these visible\r\n    things, setting forth to us the invisible wisdome and\r\n    admirable workmanship of almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nAnd could any modern writer give with such simplicity and charm the\r\n\"atmosphere\" of the violet?\r\n\r\n    \"Addressing myself unto the violets called the blacke or\r\n    purple violets or March violete of the Garden, which have a\r\n    great prerogative above others, not only because the minde\r\n    conceiveth a certaine pleasure and recreation by smelling\r\n    and handling of these most odoriferous flowers, but also\r\n    that very many by these violets receive ornament and comely\r\n    Grace: for there be made of them garlands for the head,\r\n    nosegaies and posies, which are delightful to look on and\r\n    pleasant to smell, speaking nothing of the appropriate\r\n    vertues; yea Gardens themselves receive by these the\r\n    greatest ornament of all, chiefest beautie and most gallant\r\n    grace; and the recreation of the Minde which is taken\r\n    heereby, cannot bee but verie good and honest; for flowers\r\n    through their beautie, varietie of colour and exquisite\r\n    formes do bring to a liberall and gentlemanly minde the\r\n    remembrance of honestie, comeliness and all kindes of\r\n    vertues. For it would be an unseemly thing, as a certain\r\n    wise man saith, for him that doth looke upon and handle\r\n    faire and beautifull things, and who frequenteth and is\r\n    conversant in faire and beautifull places to have his minde\r\n    not faire.\"\r\n\r\nThe bones, so to speak, of Gerard's work are, it is true, taken from\r\nDodoens's splendid Latin herbal, but it is Gerard's own additions\r\nwhich have given the book its hold on our affections. He describes\r\nwith such simplicity and charm the localities where various plants are\r\nto be found, and he gives so much contemporary folk lore that before\r\nwe have been reading long we feel as though we were wandering about in\r\nElizabethan England with a wholly delightful companion.\r\n\r\nWe know from Gerard's coat of arms that he was descended from a\r\nyounger branch of the Gerards of Ince, a Lancashire family, but there\r\nare no records at the College of Arms to show his parentage. His name\r\nis frequently spelt with an e at the end, but Gerard himself and his\r\nfriends invariably spelt it without. (The spelling \"Gerarde\" on the\r\ntitle-page of the Herbal is probably an engraver's error.) John Gerard\r\nwas born at Nantwich in Cheshire in 1545, and educated at the school\r\nat Wisterson or Willaston, two miles from his native town. In the\r\nHerbal he gives us two glimpses of his boyhood. Under raspberry we\r\nfind:--\r\n\r\n    \"Raspis groweth not wilde that I know of.... I found it\r\n    among the bushes of a causey neere unto a village called\r\n    Wisterson, where I went to schoole, two miles from the\r\n    Nantwich in Cheshire.\"\r\n\r\nWriting of yew[77] he tells us:--\r\n\r\n    \"They say that if any doe sleepe under the shadow thereof it\r\n    causeth sickness and sometimes death and that if birds do\r\n    eat of the fruit thereof it causeth them to cast their\r\n    feathers and many times to die. All which I dare boldly\r\n    affirme is altogether untrue: for when I was young and went\r\n    to schoole divers of my schoole-fellowes and likewise\r\n    myselfe did eat our fils of the berries of this tree and\r\n    have not only slept under the shadow thereof but among the\r\n    branches also, without any hurt at all, and that not one\r\n    time but many times.\"\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that at an early age he studied medicine. In his Herbal\r\nhe speaks of having travelled to Moscow, Denmark, Sweden and Poland,\r\nand it is possible that he went abroad as a ship's surgeon. This,\r\nhowever, is mere surmise. We know that in 1562 he was apprenticed to\r\nAlexander Mason, who evidently had a large practice, for he was twice\r\nwarden of the Barber-Surgeons' Company. Gerard was admitted to the\r\nfreedom of the same company in 1569.[78] Before 1577 he must have\r\nsettled in London, for in his Herbal he tells us that for twenty years\r\nhe had superintended the gardens belonging to Lord Burleigh in the\r\nStrand and at Theobalds in Hertfordshire. Hentzner, in his\r\n_Itinerarium_, gives a lengthy account of the gardens at Theobalds\r\nwhen Gerard was superintendent.\r\n\r\nGerard's own house was in Holborn and, as already mentioned, his\r\ngarden, where he had over a thousand different herbs, was in what is\r\nnow Fetter Lane.[79] What a wonderful garden that must have been, and\r\nhow full it was of \"rarities,\" ranging from white thyme to the\r\ndouble-flowered peach. How often we read of various plants, \"these be\r\nstrangers in England yet I have them in my garden,\" sometimes with the\r\ntriumphant addition, \"where they flourish as in their natural place of\r\ngrowing.\" In 1596 Gerard published a catalogue of twenty-four pages\r\nof the plants in this garden--the first complete catalogue of the\r\nplants in any garden, public or private.[80] A second edition was\r\npublished in 1599. Of Gerard's knowledge of plants the members of his\r\nown profession had a high opinion. George Baker, one of the \"chief\r\nchirurgions in ordinarie\" to Queen Elizabeth, wrote of him: \"I protest\r\nupon my conscience that I do not thinke for the Knowledge of plants\r\nthat he is inferior to any, for I did once see him tried with one of\r\nthe best strangers that ever came into England and was accounted in\r\nParis the onely man,[81] being recommended to me by that famous man M.\r\nAmb. Parens; and he being here was desirous to go abroad with some of\r\nour herbarists, for the whiche I was the means to bring them together,\r\nand one whole day we spent therein, searching the most rarest simples:\r\nbut when it came to the triall my French man did not know one to his\r\nfower.\" In 1598, the year after the publication of his Herbal, and\r\nagain in 1607, Gerard was appointed examiner of candidates for\r\nadmission to the freedom of the Barber-Surgeons' Company, but apart\r\nfrom this we have little definite knowledge of his life. He seems to\r\nhave been a well-known figure in the later years of Elizabeth and the\r\nearly years of James I., and it is probable that he held the same\r\nposition in the household of Robert Earl of Salisbury, Secretary of\r\nState, as he had held in that of his father, Lord Burleigh. A few\r\nyears before he died James's queen (Anne of Denmark) granted him the\r\nlease of a garden (two acres in all) east of Somerset House for four\r\npence a year. Besides the rent he had to give \"at the due and proper\r\nseasons of the yeare a convenient proportion and quantitie of herbes,\r\nfloures, or fruite, renewing or growing within the said garden plott\r\nor piece of grounde, by the arte and industrie of the said John\r\nGerard, if they be lawfully required and demanded.\"[82] Gerard only\r\nkept this garden for a year. In 1605 he parted with his interest in it\r\nto Robert Earl of Salisbury, and it is interesting to note that in the\r\nlegal documents connected with this transaction he is described as\r\nherbarist to James I. Of his private life we know nothing beyond that\r\nhe was married and that his wife helped him in his work. He died in\r\nFebruary 1611-1612, and was buried in St. Andrew's Church, Holborn.\r\n\r\nIn 1597, as we have seen, Gerard published the Herbal which made him\r\nfamous, but its history, as his critics point out, reflects little\r\ncredit on the author. John Norton, the Queen's printer, had\r\ncommissioned Dr. Priest, a member of the College of Physicians, to\r\ntranslate Dodoens's _Pemptades_ from Latin into English. Priest died\r\nbefore he finished his work and the unfinished translation came\r\nsomehow into Gerard's hands. Gerard altered the arrangement of the\r\nherbs from that of Dodoens to that of de l'Obel in his _Adversaria_,\r\nand of Priest's translation he merely says: \"Dr. Priest, one of our\r\nLondon College, hath (as I heard) translated the last edition of\r\nDodoens, which meant to publish the same, but being prevented by death\r\nhis translation likewise perished.\" There are no fewer than 1800\r\nillustrations in the Herbal, most of them taken from the same\r\nwood-blocks that Tabernæmontanus (Bergzabern) used for his _Eicones_\r\n(1590). Norton, the Queen's printer, procured the loan of these\r\nwood-blocks from Nicolas Bassæus of Frankfurt. They are good\r\nspecimens, and certainly superior to the sixteen original cuts which\r\nGerard added. It is interesting, however, to note that amongst the\r\nlatter is the first published representation of the \"Virginian\"\r\npotato. Gerard made so many mistakes in connection with the\r\nillustrations that James Garret, a London apothecary (and the\r\ncorrespondent of Charles de l'Escluse), called Norton's attention to\r\nthe matter. Norton thereupon asked de l'Obel to correct the work, and,\r\naccording to de l'Obel's own account, he was obliged to make over a\r\nthousand alterations. Gerard then stopped any further emendation, on\r\nthe ground that the work was sufficiently accurate, and declared\r\nfurther that de l'Obel had forgotten the English language. Mr. B. D.\r\nJackson affirms that when one compares the Herbal with the catalogue\r\nof the plants in his garden Gerard seems to have been in the right. On\r\nthe other hand, de l'Obel in his _Illustrationes_ speaks of Gerard\r\nwith great bitterness and alleges that the latter pilfered from the\r\n_Adversaria_ without acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nWhen one turns to the Herbal one forgets the bitterness of these old\r\nquarrels and Gerard's possible duplicity in the never-failing charm of\r\nthe book itself. It is not merely a translation of Dodoens's\r\n_Pemptades_, for throughout the volume are inserted Gerard's own\r\nobservations, numerous allusions to persons and places of antiquarian\r\ninterest, and a good deal of contemporary folk-lore. No fewer than\r\nfifty of Gerard's own friends are mentioned, and one realises as one\r\nwanders through the pages of this vast book that he received plants\r\nfrom all the then accessible parts of the globe. Lord Zouche sent him\r\nrare seeds from Crete, Spain and Italy. Nicholas Lete, a London\r\nmerchant, was a generous contributor to Gerard's garden and his name\r\nappears frequently. Gerard writes of him: \"He is greatly in love with\r\nrare and faire flowers, for which he doth carefully send unto Syria,\r\nhaving a servant there at Aleppo, and in many other countries.\" It was\r\nNicholas Lete who sent Gerard an \"orange tawnie gilliflower\" from\r\nPoland. William Marshall, a chirurgeon on board the _Hercules_, sent\r\nhim rarities from the Mediterranean. The names which appear most\r\nfrequently in connection with indigenous plants are those of Thomas\r\nHesketh, a Lancashire gentleman, Stephen Bridwell, \"a learned and\r\ndiligent searcher of simples in the West of England,\" James Cole, a\r\nLondon merchant, \"a lover of plants and very skilful in the knowledge\r\nof them,\" and James Garret, a London apothecary and a tulip\r\nenthusiast, who \"every season bringeth forth new plants of sundry\r\ncolours not before seen, all of which to describe particularly were to\r\nroll Sisiphus's stone or number the sands.\" Jean Robin, the keeper of\r\nthe royal gardens in Paris, sent him many rarities. For instance, of\r\nbarrenwort (_Epimedium alpinum_) he writes: \"This was sent to me from\r\nthe French King's herbarist Robinus dwellying in Paris at the syne of\r\nthe blacke heade in the street called Du bout du Monde, in English the\r\nend of the world.\" In view of Sir Walter Raleigh's well-known\r\nenthusiasm for collecting rare plants, it is at least possible that he\r\nmay have been a donor to Gerard's garden.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JOHN GERARD FROM THE FIRST EDITION OF\r\n      THE \"HERBALL\" (1597)]\r\n\r\nEven the most cursory reading of the book suggests how much we lose by\r\nthe lack of the old simple belief in the efficacy of herbs to cure not\r\nonly physical ills, but also those of the mind and even of the heart.\r\nThis belief was shared by the greatest civilisations of antiquity, and\r\nit is only we poor moderns who ignore the fact that \"very wonderful\r\neffects may be wrought by the Vertues, which are enveloped within the\r\ncompasse of the Green Mantles wherewith many Plants are adorned.\"[83]\r\nDoctors are cautious folk nowadays, but it is wonderful to think of a\r\ntime when the world was so young that people were brave and hopeful\r\nenough to imagine that mere humans could alleviate, even cure, the\r\nsorrows of others. If ever anything so closely approaching the\r\nmiraculous is attempted again one feels very sure that we shall turn,\r\nas the wise men of the oldest civilisations did, to God's most\r\nbeautiful creations to accomplish the miracle. In common with the\r\nmajority of the old herbalists, Gerard had a faith in herbs which was\r\nsimple and unquestioning. Sweet marjoram, he tells us, is for those\r\n\"who are given to over-much sighing.\" Again, \"The smell of Basil is\r\ngood for the heart ... it taketh away sorrowfulness, which commeth of\r\nmelancholy and maketh a man merry and glad.\" \"Bawme comforts the\r\nheart and driveth away all melancholy and sadnesse: it makes the heart\r\nmerry and joyfull and strengtheneth the vitall spirits.\" \"Chervil root\r\nboiled and after dressed as the cunning Cook knoweth how better than\r\nmyself is very good for old people that are dull and without courage.\"\r\nOf the despised dead-nettle he tells us that \"the flowers baked with\r\nsugar, as roses are, maketh the vitall spirits more fresh and lively.\"\r\nIn connection with borage he quotes the well-known old couplet:\r\n\r\n    \"I Borage\r\n    Bring alwaies Courage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those of our time,\" he continues, \"do use the floures in sallads to\r\nexhilerate the mind and make the mind glad. There be also many things\r\nmade of them, used everywhere for the comfort of the heart, for the\r\ndriving away of sorrow and encreasing the joy of the minde.... The\r\nleaves and floures put into wine make men and women glad and merry and\r\ndrive away all sadnesse, dulnesse and melancholy.\"\r\n\r\nOf bugloss he says: \"The physitions use the leaves, floures and rootes\r\nand put them into all kindes of medecines indifferently, which are of\r\nforce and vertue to drive away sorrow and pensiveness of the minde,\r\nand to comfort and strengthen the heart.\"\r\n\r\nRosemary was held of such sovereign virtue in this respect that even\r\nthe wearing of it was believed to be remedial. \"If a garland thereof\r\nbe put about the head, it comforteth the brain, the memorie, the\r\ninward senses and comforteth the heart and maketh it merry.\" Certain\r\nherbs strewed about the room were supposed to promote happiness and\r\ncontent. Meadowsweet, water-mint and vervain (one of the three herbs\r\nheld most sacred by the Druids) were those most frequently used for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The savor or smell of the water-mint rejoyceth the heart of man, for\r\nwhich cause they use to strew it in chambers and places of recreation,\r\npleasure and repose, where feasts and banquets are made.\"\r\n\r\n\"The leaves and floures of meadowsweet farre excelle all other\r\nstrowing herbs for to decke up houses, to strawe in chambers, halls\r\nand banqueting houses in the summertime, for the smell thereof makes\r\nthe heart merrie and joyful and delighteth the senses.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with vervain he quotes Pliny's saying that \"if the\r\ndining room be sprinckled with water in which the herbe hath been\r\nsteeped the guests will be the merrier.\"\r\n\r\nScattered through the Herbal we find recipes for the cure of many\r\nother ailments with which modern science does not attempt to cope. For\r\ninstance, under \"peony\" we read: \"The black graines (that is the seed)\r\nto the number of fifteene taken in wine or mead is a speciall remedie\r\nfor those that are troubled in the night with the disease called the\r\nNight Mare, which is as though a heavy burthen were laid upon them and\r\nthey oppressed therewith, as if they were overcome with their enemies,\r\nor overprest with some great weight or burthen, and they are also good\r\nagainst melancholie dreames.\" Under Solomon's seal one lights on this:\r\n\"The root stamped while it is fresh and greene and applied taketh away\r\nin one night or two at the most any bruise, black or blew spots,\r\ngotten by falls or women's wilfulnesse in stumbling upon their hasty\r\nhusbands' fists or such like.\" Of cow parsnip he tells us: \"If a\r\nphrenticke or melancholicke man's head bee anointed with oile wherein\r\nthe leaves and roots have been sodden, it helpeth him very much, and\r\nsuch as bee troubled with the sickness called the forgetfull evill.\"\r\nWould any modern have either the courage or the imagination to attempt\r\nto cure \"the forgetfull evill\"? In the old Saxon herbals the belief in\r\nthe efficacy of herbs used as amulets is a marked feature, and even in\r\nGerard's Herbal much of this old belief survives. \"A garland of\r\npennyroyal,\" he tells us, \"made and worne about the head is of a great\r\nforce against the swimming in the head, the paines and giddiness\r\nthereof.\" The root of spatling poppy \"being pound with the leaves and\r\nfloures cureth the stinging of scorpions and such like venemous\r\nbeasts: insomuch that whoso doth hold the same in his hand can receive\r\nno damage or hurt by any venemous beast.\" Of shrubby trefoil we learn\r\nthat \"if a man hold it in his hand he cannot be hurt with the biting\r\nof any venemous beast.\" Of rue he says: \"If a man be anointed with the\r\njuice of rue, the poison of wolf's bane, mushrooms or todestooles, the\r\nbiting of serpents, stinging of scorpions, spiders, bees, hornets and\r\nwasps will not hurt him.\" In the older herbals numerous herbs are\r\nmentioned as being of special virtue when used as amulets to protect\r\nthe wayfaring man from weariness, but Gerard mentions only\r\ntwo--mugwort and _Agnus castus_. He quotes the authority of Pliny for\r\nthe belief that \"the traveller or wayfaring man that hath mugwort tied\r\nabout him feeleth no wearisomeness at all and he who hath it about him\r\ncan be hurt by no poysonous medecines, nor by any wilde beaste,\r\nneither yet by the Sun itselfe.\" Of _Agnus castus_ he writes: \"It is\r\nreported that if such as journey or travell do carry with them a\r\nbranch or rod of agnus castus in their hand, it will keep them from\r\nweariness.\" The herbs most in repute as amulets against misfortune\r\ngenerally were angelica (of sovereign virtue against witchcraft and\r\nenchantments) and figwort, which was \"hanged about the necke\" to keep\r\nthe wearer in health. At times one feels that Gerard rather doubted\r\nthe efficacy of these \"physick charms,\" and he gives us a naïve\r\ndescription of his friends' efforts to cure him of an ague by their\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\"Having a most grievous ague,\" he writes, \"and of long continuance,\r\nnotwithstanding Physick charmes, the little wormes found in the heads\r\nof Teazle hanged about my necke, spiders put in a walnut shell, and\r\ndivers such foolish toies, that I was constrained to take by\r\nfantasticke peoples procurement, notwithstanding I say my helpe came\r\nfrom God himselfe, for these medicines and all other such things did\r\nme no good at all.\"\r\n\r\nUnder \"gourd\" Gerard gives a use of this herb which, though popular,\r\nis not to be found in any other English herbal. \"A long gourd,\" he\r\nsays, \"or else a cucumber being laid in the cradle or bed by the young\r\ninfant while it is asleep and sicke of an ague, it shall very quickly\r\nbe made whole.\" The cure was presumably effected by the cooling\r\nproperties of the fruit. In another place he recommends the use of\r\nbranches of willow for a similar purpose. \"The greene boughes of\r\nwillows with the leaves may very well be brought into chambers and set\r\nabout the beds of those that be sick of fevers, for they do mightily\r\ncoole the heate of the aire, which thing is wonderfull refreshing to\r\nthe sicke Patient.\"\r\n\r\nThere is so much contemporary folk lore embodied in Gerard that it is\r\ndisappointing to find that when writing of mugwort, a herb which has\r\nbeen endowed from time immemorial with wonderful powers, he declines\r\nto give the old superstitions \"tending to witchcraft and sorcerie and\r\nthe great dishonour of God; wherefore do I purpose to omit them as\r\nthings unwoorthie of my recording or your receiving.\" He also pours\r\nscorn on the mandrake legend. \"There have been,\" he says, \"many\r\nridiculous tales brought up of this plant, whether of old wives or\r\nrunnegate surgeons, or phisick mongers I know not, all whiche dreames\r\nand old wives tales you shall from hencefoorth cast out of your bookes\r\nof memorie.\" The old legend of the barnacle geese, however, he gives\r\nfully. It is both too long and too well known to quote, but it is\r\ninteresting to remember that this myth is at least as old as the\r\ntwelfth century. According to one version, certain trees growing near\r\nthe sea produced fruit like apples, each containing the embryo of a\r\ngoose, which, when the fruit was ripe, fell into the water and flew\r\naway. It is, however, more commonly met with in the form that the\r\ngeese emanated from a fungus growing on rotting timber floating at\r\nsea. This is Gerard's version. One of the earliest mentions of this\r\nmyth is to be found in Giraldus Cambrensis (_Topographia Hiberniæ_,\r\n1187), a zealous reformer of Church abuses. In his protest against\r\neating these barnacle geese during Lent he writes thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"There are here many birds which are called Bernacae which\r\n    nature produces in a manner contrary to nature and very\r\n    wonderful. They are like marsh geese but smaller. They are\r\n    produced from fir-timber tossed about at sea and are at\r\n    first like geese upon it. Afterwards they hang down by their\r\n    beaks as if from a sea-weed attached to the wood and are\r\n    enclosed in shells that they may grow the more freely.\r\n    Having thus in course of time been clothed with a strong\r\n    covering of feathers they either fall into the water or seek\r\n    their liberty in the air by flight. The embryo geese derive\r\n    their growth and nutriment from the moisture of the wood or\r\n    of the sea, in a secret and most marvellous manner. I have\r\n    seen with my own eyes more than a thousand minute bodies of\r\n    these birds hanging from one piece of timber on the shore\r\n    enclosed in shells and already formed ... in no corner of\r\n    the world have they been known to build a nest. Hence the\r\n    bishops and clergy in some parts of Ireland are in the habit\r\n    of partaking of these birds on fast days without scruple.\r\n    But in doing so they are led into sin. For if anyone were to\r\n    eat the leg of our first parent, although he (Adam) was not\r\n    born of flesh, that person could not be adjudged innocent of\r\n    eating flesh.\"\r\n\r\nJews in the Middle Ages were divided as to whether these barnacle\r\ngeese should be killed as flesh or as fish. Pope Innocent III. took\r\nthe view that they were flesh, for at the Lateran Council in 1215 he\r\nprohibited the eating of them during Lent. In 1277 Rabbi Izaak of\r\nCorbeil forbade them altogether to Jews, on the ground that they were\r\nneither fish nor flesh. Both Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon derided\r\nthe myth, but in general it seems to have been accepted with\r\nunquestioning faith. Sebastian Munster, in his _Cosmographia\r\nUniversalis_ (1572), tells us that Pope Pius II. when on a visit to\r\nScotland was most anxious to see these geese, but was told that they\r\nwere to be found only in the Orkney Islands. Sebastian believed in\r\nthem himself, for he wrote of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"In Scotland there are trees which produce fruit\r\n    conglomerated of leaves, and this fruit when in due time it\r\n    falls into the water beneath it is endowed with new life\r\n    and is converted into a living bird which they call the\r\n    tree-goose.... Several old cosmographers, especially Saxo\r\n    Grammaticus, mention the tree and it must not be regarded as\r\n    fictitious as some new writers suppose.\"[84]\r\n\r\nEven Hector Boece, in his _Hystory and Croniklis of Scotland_ (1536),\r\ntook the myth seriously, but in his opinion \"the nature of the seis is\r\nmair relevant caus of their procreation than ony uther thyng.\" William\r\nTurner accepted the myth and gives as his evidence what had been told\r\nhim by an eye-witness, \"a theologian by profession and an Irishman by\r\nbirth, Octavian by name,\" who promised him that he would take care\r\nthat some growing chicks should be sent to him! In later times we find\r\nthat Gaspar Schott (_Physica Curiosa Sive Mirabilia Naturæ et Artis_,\r\n1662, lib. ix. cap. xxii. p. 960) quotes a vast number of authorities\r\non the subject and then demonstrates the absurdity of the myth. Yet in\r\n1677 Sir Robert Moray read before the Royal Society \"A Relation\r\nconcerning Barnacles,\" and this was published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, January-February 1677-8. Among illustrations of the\r\nbarnacle geese, that in de l'Obel's _Stirpium Historia_ (1571) depicts\r\nthe tree without the birds. Gerard shows the tree with the birds; in\r\nAldrovandus leaves have been added to the tree and there is also an\r\nillustration showing the development of the barnacles into geese.\r\n\r\nAs in all herbals the element of the unexpected is not lacking in\r\nGerard. Who would think of finding under the eminently dull heading\r\n\"fir trees\" the following gem of folk lore? \"I have seen these trees\r\ngrowing in Cheshire and Staffordshire and Lancashire, where they grew\r\nin great plenty as is reported before Noah's flood, but then being\r\noverturned and overwhelmed have lien since in the mosse and waterie\r\nmoorish grounds very fresh and sound untill this day; and so full of a\r\nresinous substance, that they burne like a Torch or Linke and the\r\ninhabitants of those countries do call it Fir-wood and Fire-wood unto\r\nthis day: out of the tree issueth the rosin called Thus, in English\r\nFrankincense.\" In these days of exaggerated phraseology one is the\r\nmore appreciative of that word \"overturned.\" Gerard mentions the\r\nfamous white Thorn at Glastonbury, but he is very cautious in his\r\naccount of it. \"The white thorn at Glastonbury ... which bringeth\r\nforth his floures about Christmas by the report of divers of good\r\ncredit, who have seen the same; but myselfe have not seen it and\r\ntherefore leave it to be better examined.\"\r\n\r\nAnother attractive feature of this Herbal is the preservation in its\r\npages of many old English names of plants. One species of cudweed was\r\ncalled \"Live-for-ever.\" \"When the flower hath long flourished and is\r\nwaxen old, then comes there in the middest of the floure a certain\r\nbrown yellow thrumme, such as is in the middest of the daisie, which\r\nfloure being gathered when it is young may be kept in such manner (I\r\nmeane in such freshnesse and well-liking) by the space of a whole year\r\nafter in your chest or elsewhere; wherefore our English women have\r\ncalled it 'Live-long,' or 'Live-for-ever,' which name doth aptly\r\nanswer his effects.\" Another variety of cudweed was called \"Herbe\r\nimpious\" or \"wicked cudweed,\" a variety \"like unto the small cudweed,\r\nbut much larger and for the most part those floures which appeare\r\nfirst are the lowest and basest and they are overtopt by other\r\nfloures, which come on younger branches, and grow higher as children\r\nseeking to overgrow or overtop their parents (as many wicked children\r\ndo), for which cause it hath been called 'Herbe impious.'\" Of the herb\r\ncommonly known as bird's-eye he tells us: \"In the middle of every\r\nsmall floure appeareth a little yellow spot, resembling the eye of a\r\nbird, which hath moved the people of the north parts (where it\r\naboundeth) to call it Birds eyne.\" \"The fruitful or much-bearing\r\nmarigold,\" he writes, \"is likewise called Jackanapes-on-horsebacke: it\r\nhath leaves, stalkes and roots like the common sort of marigold,\r\ndiffering in the shape of his floures; for this plant doth bring forth\r\nat the top of the stalke one floure like the other marigolds, from\r\nwhich start forth sundry other smal floures, yellow likewise and of\r\nthe same fashion as the first, which if I be not deceived commeth to\r\npass per accidens, or by chance, as Nature often times liketh to play\r\nwith other floures; or as children are borne with two thumbes on one\r\nhand or such like, which living to be men do get children like unto\r\nothers: even so is the seed of this marigold, which if it be sowen it\r\nbrings forth not one floure in a thousand like the plant from whence\r\nit was taken.\" Goat's-beard still retains its old name of\r\n'go-to-bed-at-noon,' \"for it shutteth itselfe at twelve of the clocke,\r\nand sheweth not his face open untill the next dayes Sun doth make it\r\nflower anew, whereupon it was called go-to-bed-at-noone: when these\r\nfloures be come to their full maturitie and ripenesse they grow into a\r\ndowny Blow-ball like those of dandelion, which is carried away with\r\nthe winde.\" Of the wild scabious (still called devil's-bit by country\r\nfolk) he tells us: \"It is called Devil's bit of the root (as it\r\nseemeth) that is bitten off. Old fantasticke charmers report that the\r\nDevil did bite it for envie because it is an herbe that hath so many\r\ngood vertues and is so beneficent to mankind.\" Gerard's, again, is the\r\nonly herbal in which we find one of the old names for vervain: \"Of\r\nsome it is called pigeons grasse because Pigeons are delighted to be\r\namongst it as also to eat thereof.\" Golden moth-wort, he tells us, is\r\ncalled God's flower \"because the images and carved gods were wont to\r\nwear garlands thereof: for which purpose Ptolomy King of Egypt did\r\nmost diligently observe them as Pliny writeth. The floures ...\r\nglittering like gold, in forme resembling the scaly floures of tansy\r\nor the middle button of the floures of camomil, which, being gathered\r\nbefore they be ripe or withered, remaine beautiful long after, as\r\nmyself did see in the hands of Mr. Wade, one of the Clerks of her\r\nMajesties Counsell, which were sent him among other things from Padua\r\nin Italy.\" The variety of daisy which children now call \"Hen and\r\nChickens\" was known as the \"childing daisy\" in Gerard's time.\r\n\"Furthermore, there is another pretty double daisy which differs from\r\nthe first described only in the floure which at the sides thereof puts\r\nforth many foot-stalkes carrying also little double floures, being\r\ncommonly of a red colour; so that each stalke carries as it were an\r\nold one and the brood thereof: whence they have fitly termed it the\r\nchilding Daisie.\" Of silverweed he tells us: \"the later herbarists doe\r\ncall it argentine of the silver drops that are to be seen in the\r\ndistilled water thereof, when it is put into a glasse, which you shall\r\neasily see rowling and tumbling up and downe in the bottome.\"\r\nDelphinium, we learn, derives its name from dolphin, \"for the floures\r\nespecially before they be perfected have a certain shew and likeness\r\nof those Dolphines which old pictures and armes of certain antient\r\nfamilies have expressed with a crooked and bending figure or shape, by\r\nwhich signe also the heavenly Dolphin is set forth.\" Rest-harrow, he\r\nsays, is so called \"because it maketh the Oxen whilest they be in\r\nplowing to rest or stand still.\" One of the most attractive names\r\nwhich he accounts for is cloudberry. \"Cloudberrie groweth naturally\r\nupon the tops of two high mountaines (among the mossie places), one in\r\nYorkshire, called Ingleborough, the other in Lancashire called Pendle,\r\ntwo of the highest mountains in all England, where the clouds are\r\nlower than the tops of the same all winter long, whereupon the country\r\npeople have called them cloudberries; found there by a curious\r\ngentleman in the knowledge of plants, called Mr. Hesketh, often\r\nremembered.\"\r\n\r\nFor those who care to seek it Gerard supplies an unequalled picture of\r\nthe wild-flower life in London in Elizabethan days. It is pleasant to\r\nthink of the little wild bugloss growing \"in the drie ditch bankes\r\nabout Piccadilla\" (Piccadilly), of mullein \"in the highwaies about\r\nHighgate\"; of clary \"in the fields of Holborne neere unto Grays Inn\";\r\nof lilies of the valley, the rare white-flowered betony, devil's-bit,\r\nsaw-wort, whortleberries, dwarf willows and numerous other wild plants\r\non Hampstead Heath; of the yellow-flowered figwort \"in the moist\r\nmedowes as you go from London to Hornsey\"; of the yellow pimpernel\r\n\"growing in abundance between Highgate and Hampstead\"; of sagittaria\r\n\"in the Tower ditch at London\"; of white saxifrage \"in the great field\r\nby Islington called the Mantles and in Saint George's fields behinde\r\nSouthwarke\"; of the vervain mallow \"on the ditch sides on the left\r\nhand of the place of execution by London called Tyburn and in the\r\nbushes as you go to Hackney\"; of marsh-mallows \"very plentifully in\r\nthe marshes by Tilbury Docks\"; of the great wild burnet \"upon the side\r\nof a causey, which crosseth a field whereof the one part is earable\r\nground and the other part medow, lying between Paddington and Lysson\r\nGreen neere unto London upon the highway\"; of hemlock dropwort\r\n\"betweene the plowed lands in the moist and wet furrowes of a field\r\nbelonging to Battersey by London, and amongst the osiers against York\r\nHouse a little above the Horse-ferry against Lambeth\"; of the small\r\nearth-nut \"in a field adjoyning to Highgate on the right side of the\r\nmiddle of the village and likewise in the next field and by the way\r\nthat leadeth to Paddington by London\"; of chickweed spurry \"in the\r\nsandy grounds in Tothill fields nigh Westminster\"; of the pimpernel\r\nrose \"in a pasture as you goe from a village hard by London called\r\nKnightsbridge unto Fulham, a village thereby\"; of dwarf elder \"in\r\nuntoiled places plentifully in the lane at Kilburne Abbey by London\";\r\nof silver cinquefoil \"upon brick and stone walls about London,\r\nespecially upon the bricke wall in Liver Lane\"; of water-ivy, \"which\r\nis very rare to find, nevertheless I found it once in a ditch by\r\nBermondsey house near to London and never elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe glimpses he gives us of London gardens are few and one longs for\r\nmore. It is remarkable how few vegetables, or \"pot-herbs\" as they\r\ncalled them, were grown in Elizabethan times. Vegetables which figured\r\nin the old Roman menus were considered luxuries in this country even\r\nin the days of the later Stuarts. The wild carrot is an indigenous\r\nplant in our islands, but of the cultivated carrot we were ignorant\r\ntill the Flemish immigrants introduced it in the early seventeenth\r\ncentury. Parsnips, turnips and spinach were also rarities. With the\r\nexception of the wild cabbage, the whole brassica tribe were unknown\r\nto us till the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Potatoes and\r\nJerusalem artichokes were both introduced into this country in Tudor\r\ndays. Gerard was one of the first to grow potatoes, and he proudly\r\ntells us, \"I have received hereof from Virginia roots which grow and\r\nprosper in my garden as in their own native countrie.\" He was, in\r\nfact, the originator of the popular but incorrect epithet \"Virginia\r\npotato.\" The potato was not a native of Virginia, nor was it\r\ncultivated there in Tudor times. The Spaniards brought it from Quito\r\nin 1580, and Gerard had it in his garden as early as 1596. The potato\r\nto which Shakespeare refers (_Troilus and Cressida_, V. ii. 534;\r\n_Merry Wives of Windsor_, V. v. 20, 21) is, of course, the sweet\r\npotato, which had been introduced into Europe nearly eighty years\r\nearlier. Gerard speaks of this sweet potato as \"the common potato,\"\r\nwhich is somewhat confusing to the modern reader.\r\n\r\nThere is a delightful glimpse of a well-known London garden, that of\r\n\"Master Tuggie,\" who lived in Westminster and whose hobby was\r\ngilliflowers. It is the more interesting to find this passage in\r\nGerard, for, as all lovers of Parkinson's _Paradisus_ will remember,\r\nsome of the varieties of gilliflower were called after their\r\nenthusiastic grower. Indeed, who can forget their enchanting\r\nnames--\"Master Tuggie's Princesse\" and \"Master Tuggie his Rose\r\ngillowflower\"? Of gilliflowers, which vied with roses in pride of\r\nplace in Elizabethan gardens, Gerard writes thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now I (holding it a thing not so fit for me to insist upon\r\n    these accidental differences of plants having specifique\r\n    differences enough to treat of) refer such as are addicted\r\n    to these commendable and harmless delights to survey the\r\n    late and oft-mentioned Worke of my friend, Mr. John\r\n    Parkinson, who hath accurately and plentifully treated of\r\n    these varieties. If they require further satisfaction, let\r\n    them at the time of the yeare repaire to the garden of\r\n    Mistress Tuggie (the wife of my late deceased friend, Mr.\r\n    Ralph Tuggie) in Westminster, which in the excellencie and\r\n    varietie of these delights exceedeth all that I have seene,\r\n    as also, he himself, whilst he lived exceeded most, if not\r\n    all, of his time, in his care, industry and skill, in\r\n    raising, increasing and preserving of these plants.\"\r\n\r\nGerard's descriptions of the most loved English garden flowers are\r\nperhaps too well known to quote, and therefore I give only the\r\nfollowing: \"The Plant of Roses, though it be a shrub full of prickes,\r\nyet it hath beene more fit and convenient to have placed it with the\r\nmost glorious flowers of the world than to inserte the same here among\r\nbase and thornie shrubs; for the rose doth deserve the chiefest and\r\nmost principall place among all flowers whatsoever being not only\r\nesteemed in his beautie, vertue and his fragrance and odoriferous\r\nsmell, but also because it is the honor and ornament of our English\r\nScepter, as by the coniunction appeereth in the uniting of those two\r\nmost royal houses of Lancaster and Yorke. Which pleasant flowers\r\ndeserve the chiefest place in crowns and garlands. The double white\r\nsort doth growe wilde in many hedges of Lancashire in great abundance,\r\neven as briers do with us in these southerly parts, especially in a\r\nplace of the countrey called Leyland, and in the place called\r\nRoughfoorde not far from Latham. The distilled water of roses is good\r\nfor the strengthening of the hart and refreshing of the spirits and\r\nlikewise in all things that require a gentle cooling. The same being\r\nput in iunketting dishes, cakes, sawces and many other pleasant\r\nthings, giveth a fine and delectable taste. It bringeth sleepe which\r\nalso the fresh roses themselves promote through their sweete and\r\npleasant smell.\"\r\n\r\nLike most gardeners Gerard was an optimist. It is wonderful enough to\r\nthink of the rare, white thyme growing in the heart of London, but\r\nthink of the courage of trying to raise dates in the open! \"of the\r\nwhich,\" Gerard tells us (in no wise downcast by his numerous\r\nfailures), \"I have planted many times in my garden and have growne to\r\nthe height of three foot, but the frost hath nipped them in such sort\r\nthat soone after they perished, notwithstanding my industrie by\r\ncovering them, or what else I could do for their succour.\" And does it\r\nnot make one feel as eager as Gerard himself when one finds, under\r\nwater-mallows, that, though exotic plants, \"at the impression hereof I\r\nhave sowen some seeds of them in my garden, expecting the successe.\"\r\nThe mere catalogue of the plants in Gerard's own wonderful garden\r\nfills a small book, and scattered through the Herbal we find numerous\r\nreferences to it, unfortunately too lengthy to quote here.\r\n\r\nOne likes to think that Shakespeare must have seen this garden, for we\r\nknow that at least for a time he lived in the vicinity. In those days\r\ntwo such prominent men could scarcely have failed to know one\r\nanother.[85] As Canon Ellacombe has pointed out, Shakespeare's\r\nwritings are full of the old English herb lore. In this use of plant\r\nlore, which was traditional rather than literary, he is curiously\r\ndistinct from his contemporaries. Outside the herbals there is more\r\nold English herb lore to be found in Shakespeare than in any other\r\nwriter. It is, in fact, incredible that the man whose own works are so\r\nredolent of the fields and hedgerows of his native Warwickshire, did\r\nnot visit the garden of the most famous herbarist of his day. Perhaps\r\nit was to Shakespeare that Gerard first told the sad tale of the loss\r\nof his precious scammony of Syria, a tale which no one with a\r\ngardener's heart can read without a pang of sympathy, even after the\r\nlapse of three centuries. One of his numerous correspondents had sent\r\nhim the seed of this rare plant, \"of which seed,\" he says:--\r\n\r\n    \"I received two plants that prospered exceeding well; the\r\n    one whereof I bestowed upon a learned apothecary of\r\n    Colchester, which continueth to this day bearing both\r\n    floures and ripe seed. But an ignorant weeder of my garden\r\n    plucked mine up and cast it away in my absence instead of a\r\n    weed, by which mischance I am not able to write hereof so\r\n    absolutely as I determined. It floured in my garden about S.\r\n    James' tide as I remember, for when I went to Bristow Faire\r\n    I left it in floure; but at my returne it was destroyed as\r\n    is aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] Americans who have the proud distinction of being \"of Royal\r\nIndian descent\" may be interested to know that a copy of Gerard's\r\nHerbal in Oxford has been identified as having belonged to Dorothy\r\nRolfe, the mother-in-law of the Princess Pocahontas.\r\n\r\n[77] Yew berries are an ingredient in at least one prescription in a\r\nSaxon herbal (_Leech Book of Bald_, I. 63).\r\n\r\n[78] Gerard endeavoured to induce the Barber-Surgeons' Company to\r\nestablish a garden for the cultivation and study of medicinal plants,\r\nbut nothing came of the scheme.\r\n\r\n[79] Formerly it was generally supposed that Gerard's garden was on\r\nthe northern side of Holborn, but this is unlikely, for during the\r\nlatter part of Elizabeth's reign the part which is now known as Ely\r\nPlace and Hatton Garden was an estate of forty acres belonging to the\r\nBishopric of Ely. Holborn was almost a village then, and Gerard tells\r\nus in his _Herball_ that in Gray's Inn Lane he gathered mallow,\r\nshepherd's purse, sweet woodruff, bugle and Paul's betony, and in the\r\nmeadows near red-flowered clary, white saxifrage, the sad-coloured\r\nrocket, yarrow, lesser hawkweed and the curious strawberry-headed\r\ntrefoil. Wallflower and golden stonecrop grew on the houses.\r\n\r\n[80] Conrad Gesner drew up a codified list of choice plants cultivated\r\nin the gardens of about twenty of his friends, with short lists of\r\nrarities in certain gardens. Johann Franke published his _Hortus\r\nLusatiæ_ in forty-eight pages--a very scarce work--which is a\r\ncatalogue of all the plants growing near Launitz in Bohemia. The list\r\ncontains both wild and cultivated plants, and the latter are\r\ndistinguished by the addition of the letter H.\r\n\r\n[81] This must have been Jean Robin, who in 1597 was appointed Keeper\r\nof the King's gardens in Paris. We know that Gerard was on intimate\r\nterms with him, and Robin sent him numerous plants, which he\r\ngratefully acknowledges in his Herbal. Gerard frequently speaks of him\r\nas \"my loving friend John Robin.\"\r\n\r\n[82] MSS. Record Office, James I. (Domestic), Vol. IX. fol. 113.\r\n\r\n[83] W.

This\r\nhouse was at the corner of Mugwell Street (now Monkswell Street) and\r\nSilver Street, very near the site of the ancient palace of King\r\nAthelstan in Saxon days. Almost opposite Mountjoy's house was the\r\nBarber-Surgeons' Hall.

For these contain some of\r\nthe earliest records of the uses of herbs learnt from the Red Indians,\r\nlists of English weeds introduced into America by the first settlers,\r\nand, perhaps most interesting of all, what they grew in the first\r\ngardens in New England. It requires very little imagination to realise\r\nhow much the discovery of the New World meant to the botanists,\r\ngardeners and herbalists of that day, for at no time in our history\r\nwere there greater plant-lovers than in Elizabethan and Stuart times.\r\nIn their strenuous lives the soldiers, explorers and sea-captains\r\nfound time to send their friends in the Old World rare plants and\r\nother treasures, and these gifts of \"rarities\" were cherished as\r\njewels. Is not the following a vivid picture of the arrival of such a\r\npackage from the New World? \"There came a Paket, as of Letters,\r\ninrolled in a seare clothe: so well made that thei might passe to any\r\npart beeyng never so farre, the whiche beeyng opened, I founde a small\r\nCheste made of a little peece of Corke, of a good thickenesse sette\r\ntogether, whiche was worthie to be seen, and in the holownesse of it\r\ncame the hearbes, and the seedes that the Letter speaketh of,\r\neverythyng written what it was, and in one side of the Corke, in a\r\nhollowe place there came three Bezaar stones, cloased with a\r\nParchement and with Waxe in good order. The Letter was written with\r\nverie small Letters, and sumwhat harde to reade.\" The letter and the\r\nprecious gift of herbs, seeds and stones were from an officer on duty\r\nin \"New Spain\" (he describes himself as \"a Souldier that have followed\r\nthe warres in these countries all my life\"), who was unknown to\r\nMonardes, but had read his first book on the use of the herbs in the\r\nNew World, and therefore was emboldened to send him these rare plants\r\nand the \"bezaar stones.\" Nicolas Monardes, the author of this herbal\r\n(translated into English by John Frampton),[86] most gratefully\r\nacknowledges his unknown friend's kindness and writes of him, \"the\r\ngentleman of the Peru, which wrote to me this letter, although I know\r\nhym not, it seemeth that he is a man curious and affectioned to the\r\nlike thinges and I have him in great estimation. For bicause that the\r\noffice of a Souldier is to handle weapons, and to sheed bloud, and to\r\ndo other exercises apertainyng to Souldiers, he is muche to bee\r\nesteemed that he will enquire and searche out herbes, and Plantes and\r\nto knowe their properties and vertue. And therefore I dooe esteeme\r\nmuche of this Gentlemanne for the labour whiche he taketh in knowyng\r\nand enquiryng of these naturall thinges. And I doe owe much unto him,\r\n... I wil provoke hym by writyng to hym againe, to sende more thinges.\r\nFor it is a greate thinge to knowe the secreates and marvailes of\r\nnature, of the Hearbes which he hath sent me. I will make experience\r\nof them and I will know their vertues and operation and the Seedes wee\r\nwill sowe at their time.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest in the plant-life of the New World may be judged from the\r\nfact that Monardes's work, which is the earliest \"American\" herbal,\r\nwas translated into Latin by no less a botanist than Charles de\r\nl'Escluse, and into Italian, Flemish, French and English. Frampton's\r\nEnglish translation went through four editions. The original book was\r\nwritten nineteen years before the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and\r\nthroughout it there is very evident the pride of a Spanish subject in\r\nthe splendid overseas dominions of his country, then the first empire\r\nin the world and the mistress of the seas. The preface is so redolent\r\nof the atmosphere of Spanish galleons and the boundless interest in\r\nthe great new continent and its wonders, that I quote it almost in\r\nfull, although in modern print it loses much of the charm of the\r\noriginal black-letter. The writer surely had in his mind the account\r\nof the navy of Tharshish, which came once in three years, \"bringing\r\ngold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks,\" and one cannot help\r\nsuspecting that loyalty to his Catholic Majesty of Spain suggested the\r\ninclusion of lions from America in order that he might not be outdone\r\nby the splendour of Solomon. Moreover, Monardes proudly tells us that\r\nfrom the New World to Spain \"there commeth every yere one hundred\r\nshippes laden ... that it is a greate thynge and an incredle riches.\"\r\n\r\n    \"In the yere of our Lorde God, a thousande, fower hundreth\r\n    ninetie twoo: our Spaniardes were gouerned by Sir Christofer\r\n    Colon [Columbus], beeyng naturally borne of the countrie\r\n    Genoa, for to discouer the Occidentall Indias, that is\r\n    called at this daie, the Newe Worlde, and thei did discouer\r\n    the first lande thereof, the XI daie of October, of the\r\n    saied yere, and from that tyme unto this, thei haue\r\n    discouered many and sundrie Ilandes, and muche firme Lande,\r\n    as well in that countrie, whiche thei call the Newe Spaine,\r\n    as in that whiche is called the Peru, where there are many\r\n    Prouinces, many Kyngdomes, and many Cities, that hath\r\n    contrary and diuers customes in them, whiche there hath been\r\n    founde out, thynges that neuer in these partes, nor in any\r\n    other partes of the worlde hath been seen, nor unto this\r\n    daie knowen: and other thynges, whiche now are brought unto\r\n    us in greate aboundaunce, that is to saie, Golde, Siluer,\r\n    Pearles, Emeraldes, Turkeses [turquoises], and other fine\r\n    stones of greate value, yet greate is the excesse and\r\n    quantitie that hath come, and every daie doeth come, and in\r\n    especiallie of Golde and Siluer: That it is a thyng of\r\n    admiration that the greate number of Milleons, whiche hath\r\n    come besides the greate quantitie of Pearles, hath filled\r\n    the whole worlde, also thei doe bryng from that partes,\r\n    Popingaies, Greffons, Apes, Lions, Gerfaucons, and other\r\n    kinde of Haukes, Tigers wolle, Cotton wolle, Graine to die\r\n    colours with all, Hides, Sugars, Copper, Brasill, the woode\r\n    Ebano, Anill: and of all these, there is so greate\r\n    quantitie, that there commeth every yere, one hundred\r\n    Shippes laden thereof, that it is a greate thynge and an\r\n    incredle riches.\r\n\r\n    \"And besides these greate riches, our Occidentall Indias\r\n    doeth sende unto us many Trees, Plantes, Herbes, Rootes,\r\n    Joices, Gummes, Fruites, Licours, Stones that are of greate\r\n    medicinall vertues, in the whiche there bee founde, and hath\r\n    been founde in them, verie greate effectes that doeth excede\r\n    muche in value and price: All that aforesaied, by so muche\r\n    as the Corporall healthe is more Excellent, and necessaire\r\n    then the temporall goodes, the whiche thynges all the worlde\r\n    doeth lacke, the wante whereof is not a little hurtfull,\r\n    according to the greate profite which wee doe see, by the\r\n    use of them doeth followe, not onely in our Spaine but in\r\n    all the worlde.... The people of old tyme did lacke them,\r\n    but the tyme whiche is the discouerer of all thynges, hath\r\n    shewed them unto us greatly to our profite, seying the\r\n    greate neede that we had of them.\r\n\r\n    \"And as there is discouered newe regions, newe Kyngdomes,\r\n    and newe Prouinces, by our Spanyardes, thei haue brought\r\n    unto us newe Medicines, and newe Remedies, wherewith thei\r\n    doe cure and make whole many infirmities, whiche if wee did\r\n    lacke them, thei were incurable, and without any remedie,\r\n    the whiche thynges although that some have knowledge of\r\n    them, yet thei bee not common to all people, for whiche\r\n    cause I did pret[=e]de to treate and to write, of all\r\n    thynges, that thei bryng from our Indias, whiche serueth for\r\n    the arte and use of Medicine, and the remedy of the hurtes\r\n    and deseases, that wee doe suffer and endure, whereof no\r\n    small profite doeth followe to those of our tyme, and also\r\n    unto them that shall come after us, the whiche I shall be\r\n    the first, that the rather the followers maie adde hereunto,\r\n    with this beginnyng, that whiche thei shall more knowe, and\r\n    by experience shall finde. And, as in this Citee of Seuill,\r\n    which is the Porte and skale of all Occidentall Indias, wee\r\n    doe knowe of th[=e] more, then in any other partes of all\r\n    Spaine, for because that all thynges come first hither,\r\n    where with better relation, and greater experience it is\r\n    knowen.

He writes of \"Copall\" and \"Anime\"\r\n(varieties of rosin), and tells us that the Spaniards first learnt of\r\nthese from the Indian priests, who \"went out to receive them [the\r\nSpaniards] with little firepottes, burnyng in them this Copall, and\r\ngiuing to them the smoke of it at their noses.\" \"Tacamahaca\" (the\r\nIndian name for a rosin) is \"taken out by incision of a tree beyng as\r\ngreate as a Willowe Tree, and is of a verie sweete smell; he doeth\r\nbryng forth a redde fruite, as the seede of Pionia.\" The Indians used\r\nit for swellings in any part of the body and also for toothache.\r\n\"Caranna,\" another gum brought from Nombre de Dios, is discovered to\r\nbe of sovereign virtue for gout--\"it taketh it awaie with muche\r\neasines.\" The balsam of the New World, \"that licour most excellent\r\nwhiche for his Excellencie and meruerlous effectes is called Balsamo,\r\nan imitation of the true Balsamo that was in the lande of Egipt,\" is\r\n\"made of a tree greater than a Powndgarned Tree, it carrieth leaues\r\nlike to Nettles: the Indians doe call it Xilo and we do call the same\r\nBalsamo.\" There follows an account of the way in which the Red Indians\r\nmade the balsam, either by cutting incisions in the tree and letting\r\nthe \"clammish licour, of colour white but most excellent and very\r\nperfite,\" run out, or by cutting up boughs and branches of the tree\r\ninto very small pieces, boiling them in cauldrons and then skimming\r\noff the oil. \"It is not convenient, nor it ought to be kept in any\r\nother vessel then in silver (glasse or Tinne or any other thing\r\nglassed, it doth penetrate and doth passe through it), the use thereof\r\nis onely in thinges of Medecine and it hath been used of long tyme ...\r\nthe Spaniards had knowledge of it because they did heale therwith the\r\nwoundes that they did receive of the Indians: beyng advised of the\r\nvertue thereof by the same Indians, and they did see the saide Indians\r\nheale and cure themselves therewith.\" We learn that when this precious\r\nnew balsam was first brought to Spain it sold for ten ducats an ounce,\r\nand in Italy for a hundred ducats an ounce. The use of another wound\r\nherb, \"for shottes of arrows,\" of which unfortunately he does not give\r\neven the Indian name, was taught to a certain \"Jhon Infante\" by his\r\nnative servant. The book gives us many pleasant glimpses of the kindly\r\ncourtesy of the Red Indians to their foes, and though, according to\r\nsome authorities, they would never tell the secrets of the herbs they\r\nused as medicines, we have Monardes's detailed accounts of how they\r\nshowed the Spaniards the uses of them. Guiacum, for instance, was\r\nbrought to the notice of a Spaniard in San Domingo by an Indian\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting accounts is of \"Mechoacan.\" \"It is brought\r\nfrom a countrie that is beyonde the greate Citie of Mexico more than\r\nfortie leagues, that is called Mechoacan, the whiche Syr Fernando\r\nCurtes did conquer in the yere of 1524, it is a countrie of muche\r\nRiches, of Gold and chiefly of Silver ... those Mynes be so celebrated\r\nand of so muche riches that they be called the Cacatecas, every day\r\nthey goe discovering in the Lande verie riche Mynes of Silver and some\r\nof Golde, it is a countrie of good and holsome ayres, and doth bring\r\nforth healthfull Hearbes for to heale many diseases, in so muche that\r\nat the tyme the Indians had the government of it, the inhabiters there\r\nrounde aboute that Province, came thether to heale their diseases and\r\ninfirmities.... The Indians of that countrie be of a taller growthe\r\nand of better faces then the Borderers are and of more healthe.\r\n\r\n\"The principall place of that province the Indians doe call in their\r\nlanguage Chincicila and the Spaniards doe call it as thei call that\r\nrealme Mechoacan, and it is a great towne of Indians, situated nere to\r\na lake which is of swete water and of verie muche Fishe, the same Lake\r\nis like the fashion of making an horse shewe, and in the middest\r\nthereof standeth the Towne, the whiche at this daye hath greate trade\r\nof buying and sellyng.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told in detail how the Warden of the Friars of St. Francis was\r\ncured by a native Indian doctor with this herb--\"mechoacan\":--\r\n\r\n\"As soone as that Province was gotten of the Indians there went\r\nthither certaine Friers, of Saincte Frances order, and as in a\r\ncountrie so distant from their naturall soyle, some of them fell\r\nsicke, amongest whom the Warden, who was the Chief Frier of the house\r\nfell sicke, with whom Caconcin Casique, an Indian lord, a man of great\r\npower in that countrie, had very greate friendship, who was Lorde of\r\nall that countrie. The father Warden had a long sicknes and put to\r\nmuche danger of life, the Casique as he sawe his disease procede\r\nforward, he saied that he would bryng hym an Indian of his, which was\r\na Phisition, with whom he did cure hym self, and it might bee that he\r\nwould give hym remeady of his disease. The whiche beeyng heard of the\r\nFrier, and seyng the little helpe that he had there, and the want of a\r\nPhisition, and other thynges of benefite, he thanked hym and saied\r\nunto hym, that he should bryng hym unto hym: who beyng come, and seyng\r\nhis disease, he said to the Casique, that if he tooke a pouder that he\r\nwould giue hym of a roote, that it would heale hym. The whiche beeyng\r\nknowen to the Frier, with the desire that he had of healthe, he did\r\naccepte his offer and tooke the pouder that the Indian Physition gave\r\nhym the nexte daie in a little Wine.... He was healed of his\r\ninfirmitie and the rest of the Friers which were sicke did followe the\r\nfather Warden's cure and took of the Self same powder once or twice\r\nand as ofte as thei had neede of for to heale them. The use of the\r\nwhiche went so well with them that the Friers did send relation of\r\nthis to the Father Provincall to Mexico where he was: who did\r\ncommunicate with those of the countrie, giving to them of the roote,\r\nand comforting them that thei should take it, because of the good\r\nrelation that he had from those Friers of Mechoacan. The whiche beyng\r\nused of many and seyng the marueilous woorkes that it did the fame of\r\nit was extended all abrode, that in short tyme all the countrie was\r\nfull of his good woorkes and effectes, banishing the use of Ruibarbe\r\nof Barbarie and taking his name, naming it Ruibarbo of the Indos and\r\nso all men dooeth commonly call it. And also it is called Mechoaca for\r\nthat it is brought from thence.... And so thei do carry it from the\r\nNewe Spaine as Merchandise of very great price.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant itself Monardes describes thus:--\"It is an herbe that goeth\r\ncreepyng up by certaine little Canes, it hath a sadde greene coulour,\r\nhe carrieth certaine leaues, that the greatnesse of them maie bee of\r\nthe greatnesse of a good potenge dishe, that is in compasse rounde,\r\nwith a little point, the leaffe hath his little Senewes, he is small,\r\nwell nere without moisture, the stalke is of the coulour of a cleare\r\nTaunie. Thei saie that he dooeth caste certaine clusters, with little\r\nGrapes, of the greatnesse of a Coriander seede, whiche is his fruite\r\nand dooeth waxe ripe by the Monethe of September: he doeth caste out\r\nmany bowes, the whiche doeth stretche a long up[=o] the yearth, and if\r\nyou doe put anythyng nere to it, it goeth creepyng upon it. The roote\r\nof the Mechoacan is unsaverie and without bightyng or any sharpness of\r\ntaste.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published in successive parts, and the second of these,\r\ndedicated to the King of Spain, contains the first written account and\r\nillustration of \"the hearbe tabaco.\" Monardes tells us that this herb\r\nwas one \"of much antiquity\" amongst the Indians, who taught the\r\nSpaniards to use it as a wound-herb. It was first introduced into\r\nSpain \"to adornate Gardens with the fairenesse thereof and to give a\r\npleasant sight, but nowe we doe use it more for his meruelous\r\nmedicinable vertues than for his fairenesse.\" The Red Indians called\r\nit \"picielt.\" (The name tabaco was given it by the Spaniards, either\r\nfrom the island which still bears the name Tobago, as Monardes\r\ndeclares, or from a native word connected in some way with the use of\r\nthe dried leaves for smoking.) According to Monardes the leaves, when\r\nwarmed and laid on the forehead with orange oil, were efficacious to\r\ncure headaches. They were also good for toothache. \"When the griefe\r\ncommeth of a cold cause or of colde Rumes, putting to the tooth a\r\nlittle ball made of the leafe of the Tabaco, washing first the tooth\r\nwith a smal cloth wet in the Juyce, it stayeth it, that the\r\nputrifaction goe not forwarde: and this remedie is so common that it\r\nhealeth euerie one.\" Of greater interest is the account of its\r\napplication as a wound-herb and of an experiment made on a small dog\r\nat the Spanish Court.\r\n\r\n    \"A little whiles past, certain wilde people going in their\r\n    Bootes [boats] to S. John De puerto Rico to shoote at\r\n    Indians or Spaniards (if that they might find them) came to\r\n    a place and killed certain Indians and Spaniards and did\r\n    hurt many, and as by chance there was no Sublimatum at that\r\n    place to heale them, they remembered to lay upon the wounds\r\n    the Juice of the Tabaco and the leaves stamped. And God\r\n    would, that laying it upon the hurts, the griefs, madnes,\r\n    and accidents wherewith they died were mittigated, and in\r\n    such sorte they were delivered of that euill that the\r\n    strength of the Venom was taken away and the wounds were\r\n    healed, of the which there was great admiration. Which thing\r\n    being knowen to them of the Islande they use it also in\r\n    other hurtes and wounds, which they take when they fight\r\n    with the wilde people: nowe they stand in no feare of them,\r\n    by reason they have founde so great a remedie in a case so\r\n    desperate. This Hearbe hath also vertue against the hearbe\r\n    called of the Crosse boweshooter, which our hunters doe use\r\n    to kill the wilde beastes withall and which hearbe is Venom\r\n    most stronge, and doeth kill without remedie, which the\r\n    Kinges pleasure was to prooue and commanded to make\r\n    experience thereof, and they wounded a little dogge in the\r\n    throate, and put forthwith into the wound the hearbe of the\r\n    Crosse boweshooter, and after a little whyle, they powred\r\n    into the self same wound that they had annointed with the\r\n    Crosse boweshooters hearbe, a good quantitie of the juice of\r\n    Tabaco and layde the stamped leaves upon it and they tied up\r\n    the dogge and he escaped, not without great admiration of\r\n    all men that saw him. Of the which the excellent Phisition\r\n    of the Chamber of his Maiestie, Doctor Barnarde in the\r\n    margent of this booke, that sawe it, by the commaundement of\r\n    his Maiestie, writeth these wordes--'I made this experience\r\n    by the commaundement of the Kinges Maiesty. I wounded the\r\n    dogge with a knife and after I put the Crosse boweshooters\r\n    hearbe into the wound and the hearbe was chosen and the\r\n    dogge was taken of the hearbe, and the Tabaco and his Juyce\r\n    being put into the wounde the dogge escaped and remained\r\n    whole.'\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ILLUSTRATIONS OF SASSAFRAS AND TOBACCO FROM\r\n      NICOLAS MONARDES' \"JOYFULL NEWES OUT OF THE NEWE FOUNDE\r\n      WORLDE\" (1577)\r\n      (The figure of tobacco is the first printed illustration of\r\n      that plant to appear in an English book)]\r\n\r\nWe are further given an exceptionally interesting account of the use\r\nof tobacco in the religious ceremonies of the Red Indians. \"One of the\r\nmeruelles of this hearbe and that whiche bringeth most admiration is\r\nthe maner howe the Priests of the Indias did use it, which was in this\r\nmaner: when there was amongst the Indians any maner of businesse of\r\ngreat importaunce, in the whiche the chiefe Gentleman called Casiques\r\nor any of the principall poople [people] of the Countrey had\r\nnecessitie to consult with their Priestes in any businesse of\r\nimportaunce: then they went and propounded their matter to their\r\nchiefe Priest, foorthwith in their presence he tooke certeyne leaues\r\nof the Tabaco and cast them into ye fire and did receive the smoke of\r\nthem at his mouth and at his nose with a Cane, and in taking of it he\r\nfell downe uppon the ground as a Dead man, and remayning so according\r\nto the quantity of the smoke that he had taken, when the hearbe had\r\ndone his woorke he did revive and awake, and gave them then aunsweares\r\n[answers] according to the visions, and illusions whiche he sawe,\r\nwhiles he was rapte in the same maner, and he did interprete to them\r\nas to him seemed best, or as the Divell had counselled him, giuing\r\nthem continually doubtfull aunsweres in such sorte that howsoever it\r\nfell out, they might say that it was the same whiche was declared and\r\nthe aunswere that he made.\r\n\r\n\"In like sort the rest of the Indians for their pastime do take the\r\nsmoke of the Tabaco, to make themselves drunke withall, and to see the\r\nvisions, and things that represent unto them, that wherein they do\r\ndelight: and other times they take it to know their businesse and\r\nsuccesse, because conformable to that whiche they haue seene, being\r\ndrunke therewith, euen so they iudge of their businesse. And as the\r\ndevil is a deceuer and hath the knowledge of the vertue of hearbs, so\r\nhe did shew the vertue of this Hearb, that by the meanes thereof, they\r\nmight see their imaginations and visions, that he hath represented\r\nunto them and by that meanes deceiue them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Red Indians also used this herb when they were obliged to travel\r\nfor several days \"in a dispeopled countrie where they shal finde\r\nneither water nor meate.\" They rolled the leaves into small balls,\r\nwhich they put \"betweene the lower lippe and the teeth and goe chewing\r\nit all the time that they trauell and that whiche they chew they\r\nswallow downe and in this sort they journey three or foure dayes\r\nwithout hauing neede of meate or drink, for they feele no hunger nor\r\nweaknesse nor their trauel doth trouble them.\" (This custom Monardes\r\ncompares to that of the bear, which during the winter \"remaineth in\r\nhis Caue and liueth without meate or drink, with onely chewing his\r\npawes\"!)\r\n\r\nOn its first introduction into Europe tobacco seems to have been\r\nregarded as a new all-heal, and in the city of Seville, we read, \"they\r\nknow not what other to doe, hauing cut or hurt themselves but to run\r\nto the Tabaco as to a most readie remedie. It doth meruellous workes,\r\nwithout any need of other Surgery, but this only hearbe.\" One chapter\r\nis devoted entirely to an account of various cures effected by\r\ntobacco, and it is interesting to read the authoritative account of\r\nthe origin of the botanical name \"Nicotiana.\" Monardes tells us that\r\nit was so called after Nicot, \"my very friend ye first author inventer\r\nand bringer of this hearbe into France.\" It appears that \"Maister John\r\nNicot, being Embassador for his Maiestie in Portugall, in the yeere of\r\nour Lorde 1559, went one day to see the Prysons of the King of\r\nPortugall, and a Gentleman, being the Keeper of the said Prysons,\r\npresented him with this hearb as a strange plant brought from\r\nFlorida.\" The same Maister Nicot, \"hauing caused the said hearb to be\r\nset in his Garden, where it grewe and multiplyed maruellously,\"\r\nexperimented with it, and amongst other things cured a young man who\r\nhad a sore on his nose. Quite a number of cures were effected, the\r\nmost interesting being that of one of Nicot's own cooks, who \"hauing\r\nalmost cutte off his thombe with a great Chopping Knife ran unto the\r\nsaid Nicotiane and healed it\"!\r\n\r\nThe prescription for the ointment of tobacco is as follows:--\"Take a\r\npounde of the freshe leaues of the sayde Hearbe, stampe them, and\r\nmingle them with newe Waxe, Rosine, common oyle of each three ounces,\r\nlet them boyle altogether, untill the Juice of Nicotiane be consumed,\r\nthen add therto three ounces of Venise Turpentine, straine the same\r\nthrough a Linen cloth, and keepe it in Pottes to your use.\" The\r\naccount of tobacco ends thus:--\"Loe here you haue the true Historie of\r\nNicotiane of the which the sayde Lorde Nicot, one of the Kinge's\r\nCounsellors, first founder out of this hearbe, hath made me privie, as\r\nwell by woorde as by writing, to make thee (friendly Reader) partaker\r\nthereof, to whome I require thee to yeeld as harty thankes as I\r\nacknowledge myself bound unto him for this benefite received.\"\r\n\r\nWe find that the Indians first taught the Spaniards the use of\r\nsassafras, and \"the Spaniards did begin to cure themselves with the\r\nwater of this tree and it did in them greate effectes, that it is\r\nalmost incredible: for with the naughtie meates and drinkyng of the\r\nrawe waters, and slepyng in the dewes, the moste parte of them came to\r\nfall into continuall Agues.... Thei tooke up the roote of this Tree\r\nand tooke a peece thereof suche as it seemed to theim beste, thei\r\ncutte it small into verie thinne and little peeces and cast them into\r\nwater at discretion, little more or lesse, and thei sodde it the tyme\r\nthat seemed nedefull for to remaine of a good colour, and so thei\r\ndranke it in the mornyng fastyng and in the daie tyme and at dinner\r\nand supper, without kepyng any more waight or measure, then I have\r\nsaied, nor more keepyng, nor order then this, and of this thei were\r\nhealed of so many griefes and euill diseases. That to heare of them\r\nwhat thei suffred and how thei were healed it doeth bryng admiration\r\nand thei whiche were whole dranke it in place of wine, for it doeth\r\npreserue them in healthe: As it did appeare verie well by theim, that\r\nhath come fr[=o] thence this yere, for thei came all whole and strong,\r\nand with good coulours, the whiche doeth not happen to them that\r\ndooeth come from those partes and from other conquestes, for thei come\r\nsicke and swolne, without collour, and in shorte space the moste of\r\ntheim dieth: and these souldiours doeth trust so muche in this woodde\r\nthat I beyng one daie amongest many of them, informing myself of the\r\nthynges of this Tree, the moste parte of them tooke out of their\r\npokettes a good peece of this woodd, and said: 'Maister, doe you see\r\nhere the woodde, that euery one of us doth bryng for to heale us with\r\nall, if we do fall sicke, as we haue been there,' and they began to\r\npraise so muche, to confirme the meruelous workes of it, with so many\r\nexamples of them that were there, that surely I gave greate credite\r\nunto it and thei caused me to beleeve all that thereof I had heard,\r\nand gave me courage to experimente it as I have doen.\" There is\r\nanother vivid glimpse of the use of sassafras as a pomander when the\r\npestilence was rife in Seville. \"Many did use to carrie a peece of the\r\nRoote of the wood with them to smell to it continually, as to a\r\nPomander. For with his smell so acceptable it did rectifie the\r\ninfected ayre: I caried with mee a peece a greate tyme, and to my\r\nseemyng I founde greate profite in it. For with it and with the\r\nchewing of the rinde of lemmon in the mornyng and in the daye tyme for\r\nto preserve health it hath a greate strength and property. It seemeth\r\nto mee that I was delivered by the healpe of God from the fyre in the\r\nwhiche we that were Phisitions went in, blessed be our Lorde God that\r\ndelivered us from so great euill and gave us this moste excellente\r\nTree called Sassafras, which hath so greate vertues, and doth suche\r\nmaruellous effectes as we have spoken of and more that the tyme will\r\nshewe us, which is the discouerer of all thinges.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a far cry from Monardes's book to that by \"John Josselyn\r\nGentleman,\" written nearly a hundred years later. Instead of the\r\natmosphere of the El Dorado of the Spanish Main, of the galleons, of\r\nthe tropical sun and plants of the West Indies, we find ourselves in\r\nthe good company of the first settlers in New England, the Spanish\r\nEmpire being only a memory of the past. Just fifty years after the\r\nlanding of the Pilgrim Fathers on American soil, _New England's\r\nRarities discovered_ was printed at the Green Dragon in St. Paul's\r\nChurchyard, London, and the book is of peculiar interest, for it\r\ncontains the first published lists of English plants that would thrive\r\nin America. There is a certain pathos in the efforts of the new\r\nsettlers to produce in the New Country (which then took two months to\r\nreach) something that would remind them of the familiar English\r\ngardens of their old homes, and no one with a gardener's heart can\r\nread it without sympathy. The book was written by one John Josselyn,\r\nwho undertook the then perilous voyage in order to stay with his only\r\nbrother, who lived a hundred leagues from Boston. There he remained\r\nabout eight years, making it his business to collect all the\r\ninformation he could about plants that interested him. Even as late as\r\n1663 the country was very imperfectly explored, for he gravely informs\r\nthe reader that he cannot say whether New England is an island or not.\r\nHe is not very sure whether even America is an island, but is\r\nconfident that the Indians are closely allied to the Tartars.\r\n\r\nBut to turn to the subject-matter of the book. First we have a careful\r\nlist of plants which the author found and which were common in England\r\nalso, and--what is quite delightful--notes on the uses made of these\r\nplants by the Red Indians. For instance, they used white hellebore to\r\ncure their wounds, and John Josselyn tells us exactly how. They first\r\nrubbed racoon's grease or wild cat's grease on the wounds and then\r\nstrewed the dried and powdered root on to it. They also applied the\r\npowdered root for toothache. Under the yellow-flowered water-lily we\r\nfind a note to the effect that the Indians used the roots for food,\r\nand Josselyn seems to have tried them himself, for he says that they\r\ntaste of sheep's liver. \"The Moose Deer,\" he says, \"feed much on them\r\nand the Indians choose this time when their heads are under water to\r\nkill them.\" From acorns the Indians made the oil with which they\r\nrubbed themselves. This was prepared by burning rotten maple wood to\r\nashes and then boiling acorns with these ashes till the oil floated on\r\nthe top. Of American walnuts and violets he had apparently a poor\r\nopinion, for he describes the walnuts as being not much bigger than a\r\nnutmeg and \"but thinly replenished with kernels,\" and the violets as\r\ninferior to the English \"Blew Violet.\" The most interesting of the\r\nrecipes is that for the beer which he used to brew for Indians who\r\ncame to him when they had bad colds. New Englanders who still possess\r\ntreasured old housewives' books will probably find they have recipes\r\nfor the same kind of beer; for it is typical of that commonly made in\r\nEngland in the seventeenth century and is strangely flavoured with\r\nelecampane, liquorice, sassafras, aniseed, and fennel seed. Then\r\nfollows a list of plants peculiar to New England, with a long\r\ndescription of \"Indian wheat,\" of which \"the Flower [flour] makes\r\nexcellent Puddens.\" Another plant described at length is the\r\nhollow-leaved lavender, but it is difficult to identify it from the\r\nillustration. The most interesting part of this list is that\r\nconsisting of plants to which no English names had yet been given.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to believe that before the Pilgrim Fathers landed some of\r\nthe commonest weeds were unknown in their new country. Yet we have\r\nJohn Josselyn's list of these, and it includes couch-grass, shepherd's\r\npurse, dandelion, groundsel, sow-thistle, stinging-nettle, mallows,\r\nplantain, wormwood, chickweed, mullein, knot-grass and comfrey. The\r\nplantain, one always learnt as a child, follows the English colonist\r\nwherever he goes, and there is curious confirmation in Josselyn's note\r\nthat the Indians called this familiar weed \"'Englishman's Foot,' as\r\nthough it were produced by their treading.\" But the most fascinating\r\nlist of all is that of the English garden-plants which those early\r\nsettlers tried to grow, and it is impossible to read it without\r\nrealising the loving care which must have been lavished on the\r\nsouthernwood, rosemary, lavender, and other plants imported from\r\nEnglish gardens, which survived the long journey only to succumb to\r\nthe rigours of the New England winter. There is something so naïve and\r\nappealing about this list, the first gardening link, as it were,\r\nbetween England and America, that I give it in full as it stands in\r\nthe original:\r\n\r\n    \"Cabbidge growes there exceeding well\r\n    Lettice\r\n    Parsley, Marygold, French Mallowes, Chervil, Burnet,\r\n    Winter Savory, Summer Savory, Time, Sage, Carrots.\r\n    Parsnips of a prodigous size,\r\n    Red Beetes,\r\n    Radishes\r\n    Purslain\r\n    Pease of all sorts and the best in the world. I never heard of nor\r\n        did see in Eight Years time one worm Eaten Pea.\r\n    Spearmint, Rew will hardly grow\r\n    Featherfew prospereth exceedingly.\r\n    Southernwood is no plant for this Country, Nor Rosemary, Nor\r\n    Bayes,\r\n    White Satten groweth pretty well, so doth\r\n    Lavender Cotton. But\r\n    Lavender is not for the Climate.\r\n    Penny Royal,\r\n    Smalledge\r\n    Ground Ivy or Ale Hoof.\r\n    Gillyflowers will continue Two Years.\r\n    Fennel must be taken up and kept in a Warm Cellar all the Winter.\r\n    Housleek prospereth notably,\r\n    Hollyhocks.\r\n    Enula Campana, in two Years time the Roots rot,\r\n    Comferie with white Flowers,\r\n    Coriander and\r\n    Dill and\r\n    Annis thrive exceedingly, but Annis Seed as also the Seed of Fennel\r\n        seldom come to maturity; the Seed of Annis is commonly eaten of\r\n        a fly.\r\n    Clary never lasts but one Summer, the\r\n    Roots rot with the Frost,\r\n    Sparagus thrives exceedingly so does\r\n    Garden Sorrel and\r\n    Sweet Bryer or Eglantine\r\n    Bloodwort but sorrily but\r\n    Patience and\r\n    English Roses very pleasantly.\r\n    Celandine by the West Country Men called Kenning Wort grows but\r\n        slowly.\r\n    Muschata as well as in England.\r\n    Pepperwort flourisheth notably and so doth Tansie\r\n    Musk Mellons are better than our English and Cucumbers.\r\n    Pompions there be of several kinds; they are dryer than our English\r\n        pompions and better tasted; You may eat them Green.\"\r\n\r\nThe book ends in a delightfully irrelevant fashion with a poem on an\r\nIndian squaw, introduced as follows:--\"Now, gentle Reader, having\r\ntrespassed upon your patience a long while in the perusing of these\r\nrude Observations, I shall, to make you amends, present you by way of\r\nDivertisement, or Recreation, with a Copy of Verses on the Indian Squa\r\nor Female Indian trick'd up in all her bravery.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The American Physitian; or a Treatise of the Roots, Plants, Trees,\r\nShrubs, Fruit, Herbs, etc., growing in the English Plantations in\r\nAmerica_,[87] has, as its name implies, more of a medical character\r\nthan the older books. In his preface the writer, William Hughes, tells\r\nus:--\"'Tis likely some may say need we trouble ourselves with those\r\nthings we cannot reach? To such I answer, that the most part of them\r\nhere mentioned which grow not in England already are brought over\r\ndaily and made use of.... I suppose there are few but would gladly\r\nknow that there are such things in the world, although scarcely any\r\nwhich care or desire to go to see them; I hope this Description which\r\nis as right to truth as I could possibly draw it, if my eyesight\r\nfailed me not, may be acceptable, although it be far short of what I\r\nintended; it being my desire to have made it more compleat by one more\r\nvoyage into those parts of the World, in which my endeavours should\r\nnot have been found wanting for the bringing and fitting of Roots,\r\nSeeds and other Vegetables to our climate, for, to increase the number\r\nof Rarities which we have here in our Garden already; in the which I\r\nperceive much may be done, if further industry were used, but I have\r\nyet met with no opportunity to accomplish the same; and therefore hope\r\nthat some others who have conveniency will do something herein for the\r\npromotion of further knowledge in these and many other excellent\r\nthings which those parts afford, and we are yet unacquainted with. And\r\nwhosoever is offended at this that I have here written, may let it\r\nalone; it forceth none to meddle with it: I know the best things\r\ndisplease some, neither was there ever any man yet that could please\r\nall people: but in hurting none, possibly I may please some; for whom\r\nonly it is intended.\"\r\n\r\nThe book itself contains interesting accounts of yams, gourds,\r\npotatoes, prickly pears, maize (of turkeys fed on maize he says, \"If I\r\nshould tell how big some of their turkeys are I think I should hardly\r\nbe believed\"), cotton, pepper and sugar. His dissertation on the\r\nmaking of sugar is one of the earliest accounts of the process. Of the\r\n\"Maucaw tree\" he writes that \"the seeds being fully ripe are of a pure\r\ncrimson or reddish colour apt to dye the skin with a touch so that it\r\ncannot quickly be washed off.\" The Red Indians used these seeds to dye\r\ntheir skins, and Hughes remarks, \"were some Ladies acquainted with\r\nthis Rarity, doubtless they would give much for it.\" The longest\r\nsection of the book deals with the cacao tree, its fruit and the\r\nmaking of chocolate. Cacao kernels were used as tokens and cacao\r\nplantations were entailed property. \"In Carthagena, New Spain and\r\nother adjacent places, they do not only entail their Cacao Walks or\r\nOrchards on their Eldest Sons, as their Right of Inheritance (as Lands\r\nhere in England are settled on the next Heir), but these cacao kernels\r\nhave been, and are in so great esteem with them, that they pass\r\nbetween man and man for any merchandise, in buying and selling in the\r\nMarkets, as the most current silver Coyn; as I have been told and as\r\nsome credible Writers do affirm.\" There is a notable description of\r\nthe making of chocolate by the servants \"before they go forth to work\r\nin the Plantations in a morning and without which they are not well\r\nable to perform their most laborious employments in the Plantations,\r\nor work with any great courage until eleven a clock, their usual time\r\nof going to Dinner.\" A detailed account of the preparation of the\r\ndrink ends with this vivid picture: \"and then taking it off the Fire\r\nthey pour it out of the Pot into some handsome large Dish or Bason:\r\nand after they have sweetened it a little with Sugar, being all\r\ntogether and sitting down round about it like good Fellows, everyone\r\ndips in his Calabash or some other Dish, supping it off very hot.\" He\r\ndescribes all sorts of ways of using the chocolate, the best in his\r\nopinion being that of the \"Maroonoes Hunters and such as have occasion\r\nto travel the Country.\" They made it into \"lozanges,\" which \"exceed a\r\nScotch-man's provision of Oat-meal and Water, as much (in my opinion)\r\nas the best Ox-beef for strong stomacks exceeds the meanest food.\"\r\nChocolate, it will be remembered, became a very fashionable drink in\r\nEngland in the seventeenth century, but Hughes considers it inferior\r\nto the genuine stuff made in the Plantations. In fact, he cautions\r\nEnglish people to procure their chocolate straight from Jamaica, and\r\nthen to see themselves to the making of it according to his\r\ndirections!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of its impressive name, _The South-Sea Herbal containing the\r\nnames, use, etc. of divers medicinal plants lately discovered by Pere\r\nL. Feuillee, one of the King of France's herbalists ... much desired\r\nand very necessary to be known of all such as now traffick to the\r\nSouth-Seas or reside in those parts_ (1715), is only eight pages long,\r\nfive of which are devoted to figures of the plants. Nevertheless this\r\nnow rare little pamphlet is valuable inasmuch as it is probably the\r\nfirst account in English of the medicinal plants of Peru and Chili.\r\nThe writer--James Petiver--began life by serving his apprenticeship to\r\nMr. Feltham, apothecary to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He\r\nafterwards qualified as apothecary and became demonstrator of plants\r\nto the Society of Apothecaries. All his life he seems to have been\r\nrather a recluse, devoting his time to the study of natural history\r\nspecimens sent him from all parts of the world. His herbarium, now in\r\nthe Sloane Collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum, South\r\nKensington, is exceptionally interesting, for Petiver appears to have\r\nhad friends in all parts of the world, mostly sea-captains, who took\r\ndelight in sending him treasures. The value of his collection may be\r\njudged from the fact that shortly before his death, Sir Hans Sloane\r\noffered him £4000 for it. His _South-Sea Herbal_ is purely medicinal,\r\nexcept for an appeal to anyone living in Quito who \"would be pleased\r\nto procure branches of the leaves of Jesuits' Bark or Quinquina with\r\nits Flowers and Fruit, which Favour should be acknowledged and more\r\naccurate Figures given of each if communicated to your humble\r\nservant.\" There is unfortunately now no copy extant of another of\r\nPetiver's pamphlets, _The Virtues of several Sovereign Plants found\r\nwild in Maryland with Remarks on them_. Apparently not many were\r\nprinted, for there is a note to this effect at the end of the\r\nadvertisement: \"Divers of these Tracts are now so very scarce that of\r\nsome of them there are not 20 left.\" Owing to the fact that nearly\r\nevery page of illustrations in Petiver's works is dedicated to some\r\nfriend who had sent him specimens, we have preserved for us the record\r\nof his numerous correspondents. These dedications are very pleasant\r\nreading:--\r\n\r\n    \"To ye memory of y{t} curious Naturalist and Learned Father,\r\n    Geo Jos{ph} Camel for many Observations and Things sent me.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To ye memory of my curious Friend Mr. Sam Browne, Surgeon\r\n    at Madrass, for divers Indian Plants, Shells, Seeds, etc.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To Mr. George Bouchere, Surgeon, For divers Minorca Plants,\r\n    Seed, etc.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To Mr. Alexander Bartlet, Surgeon, For divers Cape and Moca\r\n    Plants, Shells, etc.\"\r\n\r\n    \"To Mr. George London, Late Gardiner to K.

The latter was intended to be a complete\r\naccount of medicinal plants and was the author's most important work,\r\nyet it is with the _Paradisus_ (strictly not a herbal, but a gardening\r\nbook), that his name is popularly associated. Of Parkinson himself we\r\ncan learn very little. We know only that he was born in 1567, probably\r\nin Nottinghamshire, and that before 1616 he was practising as an\r\napothecary and had a garden in Long Acre \"well stored with\r\nrarities.\"[88] He was appointed Apothecary to James I., and after the\r\npublication of his _Paradisus_ in 1629 Charles I. bestowed on him the\r\ntitle of Botanicus Regius Primarius. Amongst Parkinson's acquaintances\r\nmentioned in his books were the learned Thomas Johnson, who in 1633\r\nemended and brought out a new edition of Gerard's _Herball_, John\r\nTradescant,[89] the famous gardener, traveller and naturalist, and the\r\ncelebrated physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne. Parkinson died in 1650 and\r\nwas buried at St. Martin's in the Fields. There is a portrait of him\r\nin his sixty-second year prefixed to his _Paradisus_, and a small\r\nportrait by Marshall at the bottom of the title-page of his _Theatrum\r\nBotanicum_.\r\n\r\nThe full title of Parkinson's _Paradisus_, which in the dedicatory\r\nletter to Queen Henrietta Maria he truly describes as \"this Speaking\r\nGarden,\" is inscribed on a shield at the bottom of the frontispiece.\r\nThe first three words, \"Paradisi in Sole,\" are a punning translation\r\ninto Latin of his own surname.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the page is the Eye of Providence with a Hebrew\r\ninscription, and on each side a cherub symbolising the winds. In the\r\ncentre is a representation of Paradise with Adam grafting an apple\r\ntree and Eve running downhill to pick up a pineapple. The flowers\r\ndepicted are curiously out of proportion, for the tulip flower is a\r\ngood deal larger than Eve's head, and cyclamen in Paradise seems to\r\nhave grown to a height of at least five feet.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of this elaborately illustrated\r\ntitle-page is the representation of the \"Vegetable Lamb\" growing on a\r\nstalk and browsing on the herbage round about it.[90] This records one\r\nof the most curious myths of the Middle Ages. The creature was also\r\nknown as the Scythian Lamb and the Borametz or Barometz, a name\r\nderived from a Tartar word signifying \"lamb.\" It was supposed to be at\r\nonce a true animal and a living plant, and was said to grow in the\r\nterritory of the \"Tartars of the East,\" formerly called Scythia.\r\nAccording to some writers, the lamb was the fruit of a tree, whose\r\nfruit or seed-pod, when fully ripe, burst open and disclosed a little\r\nlamb perfect in every way. This was the subject of the illustration,\r\n\"The Vegetable Lamb plant,\" in Sir John Mandeville's book. Other\r\nwriters described the lamb as being supported above the ground by a\r\nstalk flexible enough to allow the animal to feed on the herbage\r\ngrowing near. When it had consumed all within its reach the stem\r\nwithered and the lamb died. This is the version illustrated on\r\nParkinson's title-page. It was further reported that the lamb was a\r\nfavourite food of wolves, but that no other carnivorous animals would\r\nattack it. This remarkable legend obtained credence for at least 400\r\nyears. So far as is known, the first mention of it in an English book\r\nis the account given by Sir John Mandeville, \"the Knyght of Ingelond\r\nthat was y bore in the toun of Seynt Albans, and travelide aboute in\r\nthe worlde in many diverse countries to se mervailes and customes of\r\ncountreis and diversiters of folkys and diverse shap of men and of\r\nbeistis.\" It is in the chapter describing the curiosities he met with\r\nin the dominions of the \"Cham\" of Tartary that the passage about the\r\nvegetable lamb occurs.[91] The origin of this extraordinary myth is\r\nundoubtedly to be found in the ancient descriptions of the cotton\r\nplant by Herodotus, Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny and others.[92] The\r\nfollowing passages in Herodotus and Pliny will suffice to show how\r\neasily the myth may have grown. \"Certain trees bear for their fruit\r\nfleeces surpassing those of sheep in beauty and excellence\"\r\n(Herodotus). \"These trees bear gourds the size of a quince which burst\r\nwhen ripe and display balls of wool out of which the inhabitants make\r\ncloths like valuable linen\" (Pliny).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TITLE-PAGE OF PARKINSON'S \"PARADISUS\" (1629)]\r\n\r\nIn his _Theatrum Botanicum_ Parkinson describes the \"Scythian Lamb,\"\r\nand one gathers that he accepted the travellers' tales about it. \"This\r\nstrange living plant as it is reported by divers good authors groweth\r\namong the Tartares about Samarkand and the parts thereabouts rising\r\nfrom a seede somewhat bigger and rounder than a Melon seede with a\r\nstalk about five palmes high without any leafe thereon but onely\r\nbearing a certaine fruit and the toppe in forme resembling a small\r\nlambe, whose coate or rinde is woolly like unto a Lambe's skinne, the\r\npulp or meat underneath, which is like the flesh of a Lobster, having\r\nit is sayed blood also in it; it hath the forme of an head hanging\r\ndown and feeding on the grasse round about it untill it hath consumed\r\nit and then dyeth or else will perish if the grasse round about it bee\r\ncut away of purpose. It hath foure legges also hanging downe. The\r\nwolves much affect to feed on them.\"\r\n\r\nThe preface to the _Paradisus_ is singularly beautiful, being typical\r\nof the simple, devout-minded author, but it is too long to quote. The\r\nbook itself is truly \"a speaking garden,\" a tranquil, spacious\r\nElizabethan garden, full of the loveliness, colour and scent of\r\ndamask, musk and many other roses; of lilies innumerable--the crown\r\nimperial, the gold and red lilies, the Persian lily (\"brought unto\r\nConstantinople and from thence sent unto us by Mr. Nicholas Lete, a\r\nworthy Merchant and a lover of all faire flowers\"), the blush\r\nMartagon, the bright red Martagon of Hungary and the lesser mountain\r\nlily. Of fritillaries of every sort--of which Parkinson tells us that\r\n\"although divers learned men do by the name given unto this delightful\r\nplant think it doth in some things partake with a Tulipe or Daffodill;\r\nyet I, finding it most like unto a little Lilly, have (as you see\r\nhere) placed it next unto the Lillies and before them.\" Of gay tulips,\r\nwhich were amongst his special favourites--\"But indeed this flower,\r\nabove many other, deserveth his true commendations and acceptance with\r\nall lovers of these beauties, both for the stately aspect and for the\r\nadmirable varietie of colour, that daily doe arise in them,\"--and of\r\nwhich he had a collection such as would be the glory of any\r\ngarden--the tulip of Caffa, the greater red Bolonia tulip, the tulip\r\nof Candie, the tulip of Armenia, the Fool's Coat tulip, the Cloth of\r\nSilver tulip and others too numerous to mention. (\"They are all now\r\nmade denizens in our Gardens,\" he joyously tells us, \"where they yield\r\nus more delight and more increase for their proportion by reason of\r\ntheir culture, than they did unto their owne naturals\"). Of daffodils,\r\ncrocuses and hyacinths in boundless profusion, amongst which are to be\r\nnoted many pleasing names that we no longer use. Of asphodels, \"which\r\ndoe grow naturally in Spaine and France and from thence were first\r\nbrought unto us to furnish our Gardens.\" Of many-coloured flags, which\r\nhe calls by the prettier name of \"flower de luce,\" and amongst which\r\nhe gives pride of place \"for his excellent beautie and raretie to the\r\ngreat Turkie Flower de luce.\" Of gladioli, cyclamen and anemones. Of\r\nthe last-named he writes thus:--\r\n\r\n\"The Anemones likewise or Windeflowers are so full of variety and so\r\ndainty so pleasant and so delightsome flowers that the sight of them\r\ndoth enforce an earnest longing desire in the mind of anyone to be a\r\npossessoure of some of them at the leaste. For without all doubt this\r\none kind of flower, so variable in colours, so differing in form\r\n(being almost as many sortes of them double as single), so plentifull\r\nin bearing flowers and so durable in lasting and also so easie both to\r\npreserve and to encrease is of itselfe alone almost sufficient to\r\nfurnish a garden with flowers for almost half the yeare. But to\r\ndescribe the infinite (as I may so say) variety of the colours of the\r\nflowers and to give each his true distinction and denomination it\r\npasseth my ability I confesse, and I thinke would grauell the best\r\nexperienced in Europe.\" (Nevertheless he writes of about fifty\r\nvarieties.) Of fragrant crane's-bills, bear's-ears, primroses and\r\ncowslips. Of violets, borage, marigolds, campions, snapdragons,\r\ncolumbines and lark's-heels (delphiniums). Of gillyflowers (why have\r\nwe given up this old-fashioned English name?), and how pleasant is the\r\nmere reading of his list of varieties--\"Master Bradshawe his daintie\r\nLadie,\" \"Ruffling Robin,\" \"The Fragrant,\" \"The Red Hulo,\" \"John Witte\r\nhis great tawny gillow flower,\" \"Lustie Gallant,\" \"The fair maid of\r\nKent,\" \"The Speckled Tawny.\" \"But the most beautiful that ever I did\r\nsee was with Master Ralph Tuggie,[93] the which gilliflower I must\r\nneedes therefore call 'Master Tuggies Princesse,' which is the\r\ngreatest and fairest of all these sorts of variable tawnies, being as\r\nlarge fully as the Prince or Chrystall, or something greater, standing\r\ncomely and round, not loose or shaken, or breaking the pod as some\r\nother sorts will; the marking of the flower is in this manner: It is\r\nof a stamell colour, striped and marbled with white stripes and veines\r\nquite through every leafe, which are as deeply iagged as the Hulo:\r\nsometimes it hath more red then white, and sometimes more white then\r\nred, and sometimes so equally marked that you cannot discern which\r\nhath the mastery; yet which of these hath the predominance, still the\r\nflower is very beautifull and exceeding delightsome.\" Of peonies,\r\nlupins, pinks, sea-holly and sweet-william. Of lilies of the valley,\r\ngentian, Canterbury bells, hollyhocks and mallows (\"which for their\r\nbravery are entertained everywhere unto every countrey-woman's\r\ngarden\"). Of foxgloves, goldilocks, valerian and mullein. Of\r\ncuckoo-flowers, \"or Ladies smockes,\" both the double and the trefoil.\r\nThe first kind, Parkinson tells us, \"is found in divers places of our\r\nowne Countrey as neere Micham about eight miles from London;\" also in\r\nLancashire, \"from whence I received a plant, which perished, but was\r\nfound by the industrie of a worthy Gentlewoman dwelling in those parts\r\ncalled Mistresse Thomasin Tunstall, a great lover of these delights.\r\nThe other was sent me by my especiall good friend John Tradescant, who\r\nbrought it among other dainty plants from beyond the seas, and\r\nimparted thereof a root to me.\" Of clematis and candytufts,\r\nhoneysuckles and jasmine. Of double-flowered cherries, apples and\r\npeaches. \"The beautiful shew of these three sorts of flowers,\" he\r\nsays, \"hath made me to insert them into this garden, in that for their\r\nworthinesse I am unwilling to bee without them, although the rest of\r\ntheir kindes I have transferred into the Orchard, where among other\r\nfruit trees they shall be remembered: for all these here set downe\r\nseldome or never beare any fruite, and therefore more fit for a Garden\r\nof flowers then an Orchard of fruite. These trees be very fit to be\r\nset by Arbours.\"\r\n\r\nIn this garden of pleasant flowers we find also many fragrant herbs.\r\n\"After all these faire and sweete flowers,\" says Parkinson, \"I must\r\nadde a few sweete herbes, both to accomplish this Garden, and to\r\nplease your senses, by placing them in your Nosegayes, or elsewhere as\r\nyou list. And although I bring them in the end or last place, yet they\r\nare not of the least account.\" He writes first of rosemary, the\r\ncommon, the gilded, the broad-leaved and the double-flowered. Of\r\nrosemary he tells us: \"This common Rosemary is so well knowne through\r\nall our Land, being in every woman's garden, that it were sufficient\r\nbut to name it as an ornament among other sweete herbes and flowers in\r\nour Garden. It is well observed, as well in this our Land (where it\r\nhath been planted in Noblemen's, and great men's gardens against brick\r\nwals, and there continued long) as beyond the Seas, in the naturall\r\nplaces where it groweth, that it riseth up in time unto a very great\r\nheight, with a great and woody stemme (of that compasse that--being\r\nclouen out into thin boards--it hath served to make lutes, or such\r\nlike instruments, and here with us Carpenters rules, and to divers\r\nother purposes), branching out into divers and sundry armes that\r\nextend a great way, and from them againe into many other smaller\r\nbranches, whereon we see at several distances, at the ioynts, many\r\nvery narrow long leaves, greene above, and whitish underneath, among\r\nwhich come forth towards the toppes of the stalkes, divers sweet\r\ngaping flowers of a pale or bleake blewish colour, many set together\r\nstanding in whitish huskes ... although it will spring of the seede\r\nreasonable well, yet it is so small and tender the first yeare, that a\r\nsharpe winter killeth it quickly, unlesse it be very well defended;\r\nthe whole plant as well leaves as flowers, smelleth exceeding sweete.\"\r\nOf sage and of lavender both the purple and the rare white[94] (\"there\r\nis a kinde hereof that beareth white flowers and somewhat broader\r\nleaves, but it is very rare and seene but in few places with us,\r\nbecause it is more tender, and will not so well endure our cold\r\nWinters\"). \"Lavender,\" he says, \"is almost wholly spent with us, for\r\nto perfume linnen, apparell, gloues and leather and the dryed flowers\r\nto comfort and dry up the moisture of a cold braine.\" Of French\r\nlavender (\"the whole plant is somewhat sweete, but nothing so much as\r\nLavender). It groweth in the Islands Staechades which are over against\r\nMarselles and in Arabia also: we keep it with great care in our\r\nGardens. It flowreth the next yeare after it is sowne, in the end of\r\nMay, which is a moneth before any Lavender.\" Of lavender cotton, of\r\nwhich he writes: \"the whole plant is of a strong sweete sent, but not\r\nunpleasant, and is planted in Gardens to border knots with, for which\r\nit will abide to be cut into what forme you think best, for it groweth\r\nthicke and bushy, very fit for such workes, besides the comely shew\r\nthe plant it selfe thus wrought doth yeeld, being alwayes greene and\r\nof a sweet sent.\" Of basil, \"wholly spent to make sweet or washing\r\nwaters, among other sweet herbes, yet sometimes it is put into\r\nnosegayes. The Physicall properties are to procure a cheerfull and\r\nmerry heart\"; and marjoram, \"not onely much used to please the\r\noutward senses in nosegayes and in the windowes of houses, as also in\r\nsweete pouders, sweete bags, and sweete washing waters.\" Of all the\r\nvarieties of thyme and hyssop--and of the white hyssop he writes that\r\nits striped leaves \"make it delightfull to most Gentlewomen.\" Hyssop,\r\nhe tells us further, \"is used of many people in the Country to be laid\r\nunto cuts or fresh wounds, being bruised, and applyed eyther alone, or\r\nwith a little sugar.\" \"And thus,\" he concludes this part of the book,\r\n\"have I led you through all my Garden of Pleasure, and shewed you all\r\nthe varieties of nature housed therein, pointing unto them and\r\ndescribing them one after another. And now lastly (according to the\r\nuse of our old ancient Fathers) I bring you to rest on the Grasse,\r\nwhich yet shall not be without some delight, and that not the least of\r\nall the rest.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his garden of pleasant flowers he leads us to the kitchen garden,\r\nfull not only of \"vegetables\" as we understand the term, of\r\nstrawberries, cucumbers and pompions, but also of a vast number of\r\nherbs in daily use, many of them never seen in modern gardens. Besides\r\nthe familiar thyme, balm, savory, mint, marjoram, and parsley, there\r\nare clary, costmary, pennyroyal, fennel, borage, bugloss, tansy,\r\nburnet, blessed thistle, marigolds, arrach, rue, patience, angelica,\r\nchives, sorrel, smallage, bloodwort, dill, chervil, succory, purslane,\r\ntarragon, rocket, mustard, skirrets, rampion, liquorice and caraway.\r\nBut according to Parkinson they used fewer herbs in his day than in\r\nolden times; for under pennyroyal we find, \"The former age of our\r\ngreat-grandfathers had all these pot herbes in much and familiar use,\r\nboth for their meates and medicines, and therewith preserved\r\nthemselves in long life and much health: but this delicate age of\r\nours, which is not pleased with anything almost, be it meat or\r\nmedicine, that is not pleasant to the palate, doth wholly refuse these\r\nalmost, and therefore cannot be partaker of the benefit of them.\" From\r\nthe kitchen garden with all these herbs, \"of most necessary uses for\r\nthe Country Gentlewomen's houses,\" he leads us, finally, to the\r\norchard, with its endless varieties of apple and pear trees, of\r\ncherries, medlars, plums, \"apricockes\" and nectarines, of figs and\r\npeaches and almonds, of quinces, walnuts, mulberries and vines (ending\r\nwith the Virginian vine, of which he says, \"we know of no use but to\r\nfurnish a Garden and to encrease the number of rarities\"), until, like\r\nthe Queen of Sheba, we feel that, with all we have heard of the\r\ncomfortable splendour of Elizabeth's reign, the half has not been told\r\nus. \"And thus,\" Parkinson concludes, \"have I finished this worke, and\r\nfurnished it with whatsoever Art and Nature concurring could effect to\r\nbring delight to those that live in our Climate and take pleasure in\r\nsuch things; which how well or ill done, I must abide every one's\r\ncensure; the iudicious and courteous I onely respect, let Momus bite\r\nhis lips and eate his heart; and so Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nParkinson's monumental work, _Theatrum Botanicum_, was completed, as\r\nalready mentioned, in his seventy-third year. In it about 3800 plants\r\nare described (nearly double the number of those in the first edition\r\nof Gerard's Herbal). In the _Theatrum_ he incorporated nearly the\r\nwhole of Bauhin's _Pinax_, besides part of the unfinished work by de\r\nl'Obel mentioned before. The book remained the most complete English\r\ntreatise on plants until the time of Ray. Parkinson originally\r\nintended to entitle it \"A Garden of Simples\"[95] and, had he done so,\r\nit is at least possible that this work, to which he devoted the\r\ngreater part of his life, would have achieved the popularity it\r\ndeserved. Except in the illustrations, it is a finer book than\r\nGerard's, but the latter remained the more popular. In fact, this\r\nherbal of Parkinson's is an outstanding proof that a good book may be\r\nruined by a bad title. _Theatrum Botanicum_ sounds hard and chilling,\r\nwhereas _Gerard's Herball_ has an attractive ring. The fact that the\r\nformer never attained the popularity achieved by the latter seems the\r\nmore pathetic when we read the author's own concluding charge to this\r\nwork of his lifetime:--\"Goe forth now therefore thou issue artificial\r\nof mine and supply the defect of a Naturall, to beare up thy Father's\r\nname and memory to succeeding ages and what in thee lyeth effect more\r\ngood to thy Prince and Country then numerous of others, which often\r\nprove rather plagues then profits thereto, and feare not the face of\r\nthy fiercest foe.\"\r\n\r\nThe ornamental title-page of the _Theatrum Botanicum_ is both\r\ninteresting and impressive. The two most important figures are those\r\nof Adam and Solomon (representing Toil and Wisdom respectively).\r\nSolomon is dressed in a long coat with an ermine cape, and he wears\r\nRoman sandals. At the four corners of the page are female\r\nfigures:--Europe driving majestically in a chariot with a pair of\r\nhorses; Asia clad in short skirts and shoes with curled points and\r\nriding a rhinoceros; Africa wearing only a hat, and mounted upon a\r\nzebra; and America, also unclothed, carrying a bow and arrow and\r\nriding a sheep with surprisingly long ears. Each of these figures is\r\nsurrounded by specimens of the vegetation of their respective\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find in the dedicatory letter to Charles I. a touch\r\nof the old belief that diseases are due to evil spirits:--\r\n\r\n    \"And I doubt not of your Majesties further care of their\r\n    bodies health that such Workes as deliver approved Remedyes\r\n    may be divulged whereby they may both cure and prevent their\r\n    diseases. Most properly therefore doth this Worke belong to\r\n    your Majesty's patronage both to further and defend that\r\n    malevolent spirits should not dare to cast forth their\r\n    venome or aspertions to the prejudice of any well-deserving,\r\n    but that thereby under God and Good direction, all may live\r\n    in health as well as wealth, peace and godliness, which God\r\n    grant and that this boldnesse may be pardoned to\r\n\r\n                                 \"Your Majestyes\r\n                                      \"Loyale Subject\r\n                                           \"Servant and Herbarist\r\n                                                \"JOHN PARKINSON.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TITLE-PAGE OF PARKINSON'S \"THEATRUM BOTANICUM\"\r\n      (1640)]\r\n\r\nThere are letters extolling the Herbal from three Oxford doctors, two\r\nof whom refer to the then newly-made physic garden on the Cherwell.\r\nOne writes thus: \"Oxford and England are happy in the foundation of a\r\nspacious illustrious physicke garden, compleately beautifully walled\r\nand gated, now in levelling and planting with the charges and expences\r\nof thousands by the many wayes Honourable Earle of Danby, the\r\nfurnishing and enriching whereof and of many a glorious Tempe, with\r\nall usefull and delightfull plants will be the better expedited by\r\nyour painefull happy satisfying Worke.\r\n\r\n\"Tho.

Sweete smelling Plants.\r\n    2. Purging Plants.\r\n    3. Venemous Sleepy and Hurtfull plants and their Counter poysons.\r\n    4. Saxifrages.\r\n    5. Vulnerary or Wound Herbs.\r\n    6. Cooling and Succory like Herbs.\r\n    7. Hot and sharpe biting Plants.\r\n    8. Umbelliferous Plants.\r\n    9. Thistles and Thorny Plants.\r\n    10. Fearnes and Capillary Herbes.\r\n    11.

Trees and Shrubbes.\r\n    17. Strange and Outlandish Plants.\r\n\r\nUnder \"The Unordered Tribe\" we find the naïve remark: \"In this tribe\r\nas in a gathering campe I must take up all those straglers that have\r\neither lost their rankes or were not placed in some of the foregoing\r\norders that so I may preserve them from losse and apply them to some\r\nconvenient service for the worke\"!\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how much folk lore survives even in Parkinson's\r\nHerbal. Like Gerard, he pours scorn on a good many contemporary\r\nbeliefs, but many he accepts unquestioningly, especially those\r\nconcerning the use of herbs as amulets and also for the promotion of\r\nhappiness. He gives also some old gardening beliefs not to be found in\r\nother herbals, but very common in contemporary books on gardening and\r\nhusbandry, and more bee lore than most herbals contain. Nearly all the\r\nold herbalists believed in the value of growing balm near the\r\nbeehives, and also of rubbing the hive with this herb, but Parkinson\r\nalone tells us of the harmful effects of woad:[96] \"Some have sowen it\r\nbut they have founde it to be the cause of the Destruction of their\r\nBees, for it hath been observed that they have dyed as it were of a\r\nFlix that have tasted hereof.\" Of balm,[97] however, he writes: \"it is\r\nan hearbe wherein Bees do much delight both to have their Hives rubbed\r\ntherewith to keepe them together and draw others and for them to suck\r\nand feed upon.\" Elsewhere he tells us that \"it hath been observed that\r\nbees will hardly thrive well where many Elmes doe grow or at least if\r\nthey upon their first going forth abroad after Winter doe light on the\r\nbloomings or seed thereof.\"[98] Of the sweet-smelling flag he says:\r\n\"it is verily believed of many that the leaves or roots of Acorus\r\ntyed to a hive of Bees stayeth them from wandering or flying away and\r\ndraweth a greater resort of others thereto.\"[99]\r\n\r\nUpon the use of herbs as amulets his views seem inconsistent. He is\r\nscornful of the custom of hanging a piece of mistletoe to children's\r\nnecks \"against witchcraft and the illusion of Sathan\"; yet he gravely\r\ninforms us that \"if the sope that is made of the lye of the ashes [of\r\nglassewort] be spread upon a piece of thicke course brown paper cut\r\ninto the forme of their shooe sole, that are casually taken speechless\r\nand bound to the soles of their feete it will bring again the speech\r\nand that within a little time after the applying thereof if there be\r\nany hope of being restored while they live: this hath been tried to be\r\neffectuall upon diverse persons.\"[100] The custom of wearing\r\nmeadowsweet or hanging it up in living-rooms[101] he describes as a\r\n\"superstitious conceit,\" but he accepts without demur the\r\ntradition[102] that a wreath of periwinkle \"worne about the legs\r\ndefendeth them that wear it from the crampe.\" Bartholomæus Anglicus\r\ntells us that Augustus Cæsar used to wear a wreath of bryony during a\r\nthunderstorm to protect himself from lightning, but the story is not\r\nrepeated until, after the lapse of four hundred years, we find in\r\nParkinson the statement that \"Augustus Cæsar was wont to weare bryony\r\nwith bayes made into a roule or garlande thereby to be secured from\r\nlightening.\"[103] Parkinson regards the use of herbs against\r\nwitchcraft as sheer foolishness, but he is the only herbalist who\r\ngives us a potion[104] which \"resisteth such charmes or the like\r\nwitchery that is used in such drinkes that are given to produce love.\"\r\nLike Gerard, he does not question the efficacy of borage, bugloss and\r\nmany other herbs to promote happiness. Of borage[105] he tells us:\r\n\"The leaves floures and seedes are very cordiall and helpe to expell\r\npensivenesse and melancholie that ariseth without manifest cause\"; and\r\nof a confection made from oak galls,[106] that it is \"dayly commended\r\nand used with good effect against Melancholy passions and sorrow\r\nproceeding of no evident cause.\" Water yarrow \"is taken with vinegar\r\nto helpe casuall sighings also the Toothache.\"[107] Under\r\nviper's-grass[108] we find \"the water distilled in glasses or the\r\nroote itself taken is good against the passions and tremblings of the\r\nheart as also against swoonings sadnes and melancholy,\" and under\r\nbugloss,[109] that \"the rootes or seedes are effectuall to comfort the\r\nheart and to expell sadnesse and causelesse melancholy.\" In common\r\nwith other herbalists he believed also that herbs could be used to\r\nstrengthen the memory, to help weak brains, to quicken the senses and\r\neven to soothe \"frenzied\" people. Of eyebright,[110] used for so many\r\ncenturies, and even until recent times, to help dull sight, he says:\r\n\"it helpeth a weake braine or memory and restoreth them being decayed\r\nin a short time.\" Fleabane \"bound to the forehead is a great helpe to\r\ncure one of the frensie,\" while \"the distilled water of thyme applyed\r\nwith vinegar of Roses to the forehead easeth the rage of\r\nFrensye.\"[111] Lavender is of \"especiall good use for all griefes and\r\npaines of the head and brain,\"[112] and sage[113] is of \"excellent\r\ngood use to helpe the memory by warming and quickening the senses.\"\r\n\r\nParkinson gives more beauty recipes than any other herbalist. For\r\nthose who wish to darken their hair he recommends washing it with a\r\ndecoction of bramble leaves.[114] The golden flowers of mullein[115]\r\n\"boyled in lye dyeth the haires of the head yellow and maketh them\r\nfaire and smooth.\" The ashes of southernwood[116] mixed with old salad\r\noil will cause a beard to grow or hair on a bald head, and yarrow is\r\nalmost as good; garden spurge, elder flowers, broom, madder, rue,\r\ngentian, scabious, betony, elecampane, Solomon's Seal, the great\r\nhawkweed and lupin are all excellent to \"cleanse the skinne from\r\nfreckles, sunburn and wrinkles.\"[117] The French women \"account the\r\ndistilled water of pimpernell mervailous good to clense the skinne\r\nfrom any roughnesse deformity or discolouring thereof and to make it\r\nsmooth neate and cleere.\"[118] The Italian dames, however, \"doe much\r\nuse the distilled water of the whole plant of Solomon's Seal.\"[119]\r\nLupin seems to have the most remarkable virtue, for not only will it\r\ntake away all smallpox marks, but it will also make the user \"look\r\nmore amiable\"! Many women, therefore, \"doe use the meale of Lupines\r\nmingled with the gall of a goate and some juyce of Lemons to make into\r\na forme of a soft ointment.\"[120] Parkinson is the only herbalist who\r\ngives recipes to enable people to get thin and also to look pale. \"The\r\npowder of the seedes of elder[121] first prepared in vinegar and then\r\ntaken in wine halfe a dramme at a time for certaine dayes together is\r\na meane to abate and consume the fat flesh of a corpulent body and to\r\nkeepe it leane.\" For those who like to look pale he recommends cumin\r\nseed and bishopsweed.[122] And \"for a sweet powder[123] to lay among\r\nlinnen and garments and to make sweet waters to wash hand-gloves or\r\nother things to perfume them\" he recommends the roots of the\r\nsweet-smelling flag.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the curious out-of-the-way pieces of information on all\r\nsorts of matters which are so interesting in Parkinson's Herbal. He\r\ntells us that three several sorts of colours are made from the berries\r\nof the purging thorn; that the yellow dye is used by painters, \"and\r\nalso by Bookbinders to colour the edges of Bookes and by leather\r\ndressers to colour leather\"; that the green dye is \"usually put up into\r\ngreat bladders tyed with strong thred at the head and hung up untill\r\nit is drye, which is dissolved in water or wine, but sacke is the best\r\nto preserve the colour from 'starving,' as they call it, that is from\r\ndecaying, and to make it hold fresh the longer\"; and that the purple\r\ndye is made by leaving the berries on the bushes until the end of\r\nNovember, when they are ready to drop off. That the best mushrooms grow\r\nunder oaks or fir trees. That spurry leaves bruised and laid to a cut\r\nfinger will speedily heal it, \"whereof the Country people in divers\r\nplaces say they have had good experience,\" and that it is also good for\r\ncausing \"the Kine to give more store of milke than ordinary otherwise,\r\nso it causeth Pullaine likewise to lay more store of egges.\" That the\r\nfruit of the bead tree \"being drilled and drawne on stringes serves\r\npeople beyond sea to number their prayers thereon least they forget\r\nthemselves and give God too many.\" That in Warwickshire the female fern\r\nwas always used \"in steed of Sope to wash their clothes,\" and that it\r\nwas gathered about Midsummer, \"unto good big balls which when they will\r\nuse them they burne them in the fire until it becomes blewish, which\r\nbeing then layd by will dissolve into powder of itselfe, like unto\r\nLime: foure of these balles being dissolved in warme water is\r\nsufficient to wash a whole bucke full of clothes.\" That the burning of\r\nlupin seeds drives away gnats, and that half-sodden barley \"given to\r\nHennes that hardly or seldome lay egges will cause them to lay both\r\ngreater and more often.\" That country housewives use that common weed\r\nhorsetail to scour their wooden, pewter and brass vessels, and\r\nsometimes boil the young tops of the same weed and eat them like\r\nasparagus. That bramble leaves do not fall until all the sharp frosts\r\nare over, \"whereby the country men do observe that the extremity of\r\nWinter is past when they fall off.\" That every year sacks full of\r\nviolets are sent from Marseilles to Alexandria and other parts of\r\nEgypt, \"where they use them boyled in water which only by their\r\nreligion they are enjoined to drinke.\" That if you suspect your wine is\r\nwatered \"you shall put some thereof into a cup that is made of ivie\r\nwood and if there be any water therein it will remaine in the cup and\r\nthe wine will soak through, for the nature of Ivie is not to hold any\r\nwine so great an antipathy there is between them.\" That skilful\r\nshepherds are careful not to let their flocks feed in pastures where\r\nmouseare abounds, \"lest they grow sicke and leane and die quickly\r\nafter.\" That writing-ink can be made of the green fruit of alder trees.\r\nThat the bark of the same tree is useful for making \"a blacke dye for\r\nthe courser sorts of things,\" and that the leaves put under the bare\r\nfeet of travellers are \"a great refreshing unto them.\" That the rose of\r\nJericho opened the night our Saviour was born, and that placed in any\r\nhouse it will open when a child is born. That mouseare if given to any\r\nhorse \"will cause that he shall not be hurt by the Smith that shooeth\r\nhim.\" That purslane is not only a sovereign remedy for crick in the\r\nneck, but also for \"blastings by lightening, or planets and for\r\nburnings by Gunpowder or otherwise.\" That country folk in Kent and\r\nSussex call sopewort \"Gill-run-by-the-streete.\" That agrimony leaves\r\nwill cure cattle suffering from coughs, and that wounded deer use this\r\nsame herb to heal their hurts. That a decoction made of hemp will draw\r\nearthworms out of their holes and that fishermen thus obtain their\r\nbait. That crops of woad may be cut three times in the year, and that\r\ndyers' weed will change to green any cloth or silk first dyed blue with\r\nwoad, \"and for these uses there is great store of this herbe spent in\r\nall countries and thereof many fields are sowen for the purpose.\" That\r\ncountry-folk use goose-grass as a strainer \"to clear their milke from\r\nstrawes, haires, and any other thing that falleth into it.\" That St.\r\nJohn's wort is used by country-folk to drive away devils. That \"Clownes\r\nwoundwort\" owes its name to a labourer who healed himself therewith of\r\na cut with a scythe in his leg. That willow-herb, being burned,\r\n\"driveth away flies and gnats and other such like small creatures which\r\nuse in diverse places that are neere to Fennes, marsh or water sides to\r\ninfest them that dwell there in the night season to sting and bite\r\nthem, leaving the marks and spots thereof in their faces which beside\r\nthe deformity, which is but for a while, leaveth them that are thus\r\nbitten not without paine for a time.\" That from turnesole\r\n(heliotropium) are made \"those ragges of cloth which are usually called\r\nTurnesole in the Druggists and Grocers shoppes and with all other\r\npeople and serveth to colour jellies or other things as every one\r\nplease.\" That when French ladies coloured their faces with an ointment\r\ncontaining anchusa the colour did not last long. That no \"good\r\ngentlewoman in the land that would do good\" should be without a store\r\nof bugloss ointment either for her own family \"or other her poor\r\nneighbours that want helpe and means to procure it,\" and that beyond\r\nthe sea in France and Germany it is a common proverb \"that they neede\r\nneither Physition to cure their inward diseases nor Chirurgion to helpe\r\nthem of any wound or sore that have this Bugle and Sanicle at hand by\r\nthem to use.\" That this is equally true of the herb self-heale. That\r\ncountry-folk use sanicle to anoint their hands \"when they are chapt by\r\nthe winde.\" That goat's rue is good for fattening hens. That Herbe True\r\nlove taken every day for twenty days will help those \"that by\r\nwitchcraft (as it is thought) have become half foolish to become\r\nperfectly restored to their former good estate.\" That the best starch\r\nis made from the root of cuckoo-pint, and that in former dayes when the\r\nmaking of our ordinary starch \"was not knowen or frequent in use; the\r\nfinest Dames used the rootes hereof to starch their linnen, which would\r\nso sting, exasperate and choppe the skinne of their servants' hands\r\nthat used it, that they could scarce get them smooth and whole with all\r\nthe nointing they could doe before they should use it againe.\" That the\r\nroot of this same herb, cut small and mixed with a sallet of white\r\nendive or lettice, is \"an excellent dish to entertain a smell-feast or\r\nunbidden unwelcome guest to a man's table, to make sport with him and\r\ndrive him from his too much boldnesse; or the pouder of the dried roote\r\nstrawed upon any daintie bit of meate that may be given him to eate;\r\nfor either way within a while after the taking of it, it will so\r\nburne and pricke his mouthe that he shall not be able either to eate a\r\nbit more or scarce to speak for paine and so will abide untill there be\r\nsome new milk or fresh butter given, which by little and little will\r\ntake away the heate and pricking and restore him againe.\" That another\r\n\"good jest for a bold unwelcome guest\" is to infuse nightshade in a\r\nlittle wine for six or seven hours and serve it to the guest, who then\r\n\"shall not be able to eat any meate for that meale nor untill he drinks\r\nsome vinegar which will presently dispell that qualitie and cause him\r\nto fall to his viands with as good a stomach as he had before.\" That\r\nsufferers from toothache should rub the bruised root of crowfoote on to\r\ntheir fingers; by causing \"more paine therein than is felt by the\r\ntoothach it taketh away the pain.\" That the juice of fumitory, if\r\ndropped in the eyes, will take away the redness and other defects,\r\n\"although it procure some paine for the present and bringeth forth\r\nteares.\" That the hunters and shepherds of Austria commend the roots of\r\nthe supposed wolf's-bane \"against the swimming or turning in the head\r\nwhich is a disease subject to those places rising from the feare and\r\nhorroure of such steepe downfalls and dangerous places which they doe\r\nand must continually passe.\" That scabious, if bruised and applied \"to\r\nany place wherein any splinter, broken bone, or any such like thing\r\nlyeth in the flesh doth in short time loosen it and causeth it to be\r\neasily drawen forth.\" That butcher's broom was used in olden times to\r\npreserve \"hanged meate\" from being eaten by mice and also for the\r\nmaking of brooms, \"but the King's Chamber is by revolution of time\r\nturned to the Butcher's stall, for that a bundle of the stalkes tied\r\ntogether serveth them to cleanse their stalls and from thence have we\r\nour English name of Butcher's broom.\" That the down of swallow-wort\r\n\"doth make a farre softer stuffing for cushions or pillowes or the like\r\nthan Thistle downe which is much used in some places for the like\r\npurpose.\" That, if ivory is boiled with mandrake root for six hours,\r\nthe ivory will become so soft \"that it will take what form or\r\nimpression you will give it.\" That fresh elder flowers, hung in a\r\nvessel of new wine and pressed every evening for seven nights together,\r\n\"giveth to the wine a very good relish and a smell like Muscadine.\"\r\nThat the moth mullein is of no use except that it will attract moths\r\nwherever it is laid. That if pennyroyal is put into \"unwholesome and\r\nstinking waters that men must drinke (as at sea in long voyages) it\r\nmaketh them the less hurtful.\" And to conclude, it is from Parkinson we\r\nlearn that \"Queen Elizabeth of famous memorie did more desire\r\nmedowsweet then any other sweete herbe to strewe her chambers withall.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JOHN PARKINSON FROM THE TITLE-PAGE OF\r\n      THE \"PARADISUS\" (1629)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] See _Theatrum Botanicum_, p. 609.\r\n\r\n[89] Both John Tradescant and his son were gardeners to Charles I. and\r\nHenrietta Maria. John Tradescant the elder is said by Anthony à Wood\r\nto have been a Fleming or a Dutchman, but this is doubtful. The name\r\nis neither Flemish nor Dutch but probably English, and in the\r\ninscription on his tomb in Lambeth Churchyard he and his son are\r\ndescribed as \"both gardeners to the rose and lily queen.\" This was\r\nHenrietta Maria. Parkinson in his _Paradisus_ speaks of him as \"that\r\npainfull industrious searcher and lover of all nature's varieties.\"\r\nTradescant accompanied Sir Dudley Digges on his voyage round the North\r\nCape to Archangel, and on his return wrote an account of the plants he\r\nhad found in Russia--the earliest extant record of plants in that\r\npart. It is interesting to note that in this he compares the soil of\r\nRussia to that of Norfolk. In 1620 Tradescant joined an expedition\r\nagainst the Algerine corsairs as a gentleman volunteer, and he also\r\naccompanied the Duke of Buckingham (George Villiers), to whom he had\r\nformerly been gardener, on the ill-fated expedition to La Rochelle. On\r\nBuckingham's death he entered the royal service, and probably at this\r\ntime established his well-known physic garden and museum at Lambeth.\r\nThe house was called Tradescant's ark. There are three unsigned and\r\nundated portraits of the elder Tradescant in the Ashmolean Collection\r\nat Oxford.\r\n\r\n[90] It also figures on the title-page of Parkinson's _Theatrum\r\nBotanicum_.\r\n\r\n[91] \"Now schalle I seye you semyingly of Countries and Yles that bea\r\nbeyonde the Countries that I have spoken of.

COLES,\r\n    _The Art of Simpling_, 1656.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later seventeenth-century herbals are marked by a return to the\r\nbelief in the influence upon herbs of the heavenly bodies, but it is a\r\ntravesty rather than a reflection of the ancient astrological lore.\r\nThe most notable exponent of this debased lore was the infamous\r\nNicholas Culpeper, in whom, nevertheless, the poor people in the East\r\nEnd seem to have had a boundless faith. It is impossible to look at\r\nthe portrait of that light-hearted rogue without realising that there\r\nmust have been something extraordinarily attractive about the man who\r\nwas the last to set up publicly as an astrologer and herb doctor. He\r\nwas the son of a clergyman who had a living somewhere in Surrey. After\r\na brief time at Cambridge he was apprenticed to an apothecary near St.\r\nHelen's, Bishopsgate, and shortly afterwards set up for himself in Red\r\nLion Street, Spitalfields, as an astrologer and herbalist. Culpeper\r\nwas a staunch Roundhead and fought in at least one battle. All through\r\nthe war, however, he continued his practice and he acquired a great\r\npopularity in the East End of London. In 1649 he issued his _Physical\r\nDirectory_, which was a translation of the _London Dispensatory_. This\r\ndrew down on him the fury of the College of Physicians, and the book\r\nwas virulently attacked in a broadside issued in 1652, entitled \"A\r\nfarm in Spittlefields where all the knick-knacks of astrology are\r\nexposed to open sale.\" By this time his works were enjoying an\r\nenormous sale. No fewer than five editions of his _English Physician\r\nEnlarged_ appeared before 1698, and it was reissued even as late as\r\n1802 and again in 1809. There is a vivid description of Culpeper in\r\n_The Gentleman's Magazine_ for May 1797:--\r\n\r\n    \"He was of a middle stature, of a spare lean body, dark\r\n    complexion, brown hair, rather long visage, piercing quick\r\n    eyes, very active and nimble. Though of an excellent wit,\r\n    sharp fancy, admirable conception and of an active\r\n    understanding, yet occasionally inclined to melancholy,\r\n    which was such an extraordinary enemy to him that sometimes\r\n    wanting company he would seem like a dead man. He was very\r\n    eloquent, a good orator though very conceited and full of\r\n    jest, which was so inseparable to him that in his most\r\n    serious writings, he would mingle matters of levity and\r\n    extremely please himself in so doing. Though his family\r\n    possessed considerable property it appears he was\r\n    exceedingly restricted in his pecuniary concerns, which\r\n    probably was the cause of his early leaving the University,\r\n    as he observes; though his mother lived till he was\r\n    twenty-three years of age and left him well provided, yet he\r\n    was cheated or nearly spent all his fortune in the outset of\r\n    life. Another author observes it is most true that he was\r\n    always subject to a consumption of the purse,\r\n    notwithstanding the many ways he had to assist him. His\r\n    patrimony was also chiefly consumed at the University.\r\n    Indeed he had a spirit so far above the vulgar, that he\r\n    condemned and scorned riches any other way than to make them\r\n    serviceable to him. He was as free of his purse as of his\r\n    pen.... He acknowledged he had many pretended friends, but\r\n    he was rather prejudiced than bettered by them, for, when he\r\n    most stood in need of their friendship and assistance they\r\n    most of all deceived him.\"\r\n\r\nCulpeper wrote a number of medical works which do not concern us here,\r\nbut his name will always be associated with his Herbal. His reason for\r\nhaving written it he affirms to be that, of the operation of herbs by\r\nthe stars he found few authors had written, \"and those as full of\r\nnonsense and contradiction as an Egg is full of meat. This not being\r\npleasing and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers\r\nDr. Reason and Dr. Experience and took a voyage to visit my Mother\r\nNature, by whose advice together with the help of Dr. Diligence I at\r\nlast obtained my desire and, being warned by Mr. Honesty (a stranger\r\nin our days) to publish it to the world, I have done it.\" It is\r\nimpossible to read any part of this absurd book without a vision\r\narising of the old rogue standing at the street corner and not only\r\ncollecting but holding an interested crowd of the common folk by the\r\nsort of arguments which they not only understand but appreciate. In\r\nhis preface he warns his readers against the false copies of his book\r\n\"that are printed of that letter the small Bibles are printed with ...\r\nthere being twenty or thirty gross errors in every sheet.\" He is\r\nwithering in his criticism of those who quote old authors as\r\nauthorities. \"They say Reason makes a man differ from a beast; if that\r\nbe true, pray what are they that instead of Reason for their judgment\r\nquote old authors?\" In his preface, as throughout his book, he affirms\r\nhis belief in the connection between herbs and stars. Diseases, he\r\nasserts, vary according to the motions of the stars, \"and he that\r\nwould know the reason for the operation of the herbs must look up as\r\nhigh as the stars. It is essential to find out what planet has caused\r\nthe disease and then by what planet the afflicted part of the body is\r\ngoverned. In the treatment of the disease the influence of the planet\r\nmust be opposed by herbs under the influence of another planet, or in\r\nsome cases by sympathy, that is each planet curing its own disease.\"\r\nElsewhere he directs that plants must always be picked according to\r\nthe planet that is in the ascendant. Culpeper asserts that herbs\r\nshould be dried in the sun,[124] his ingenious reasoning being\r\nthis:--\"For if the sun draw away the virtues of the herb it must needs\r\ndo the like by hay, which the experience of every farmer will explode\r\nfor a notable piece of nonsense.\" He also pours scorn on those who say\r\nthat the sap does not rise in the winter. Here his argument is even\r\nmore remarkable, and yet one cannot help realising how effectual it\r\nwould be with the class of folk with whom he dealt. \"If the sap fall\r\ninto the roots in the fall of the leaf and lies there all the winter\r\nthen must the root grow all the winter, but the root grows not at all\r\nin the winter as experience teaches, but only in the summer. If you\r\nset an apple kernel in the spring you shall find the root to grow to a\r\npretty bigness in the summer and be not a whit bigger next spring.\r\nWhat doth the sap do in the root all the winter that while? Pick\r\nstraws? 'Tis as rotten as a rotten post.\" He gives as his own version\r\nof what happens to the sap that \"when the sun declines from the tropic\r\nof cancer, the sap begins to congeal both in root and branch. When he\r\ntouches the tropic of capricorn and ascends to uswards it begins to\r\nwax thin again.\" One cannot help suspecting that Culpeper knew\r\nperfectly well what nonsense he was talking, but that he also realised\r\nhow remunerative such nonsense was and how much his customers were\r\nimpressed by it. In his dissertation on wormwood one feels that he\r\nwas writing with his tongue in his cheek, especially in the\r\nconclusion, which is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"He that reads this and understands what he reads hath a\r\n    jewel of more worth than a diamond. He that understands it\r\n    not is as little fit to give physick. There lies a key in\r\n    these words, which will unlock (if it be turned by a wise\r\n    hand) the cabinet of physic. I have delivered it as plain as\r\n    I durst ... thus shall I live when I am dead. And thus I\r\n    leave it to the world, not caring a farthing whether they\r\n    like it or dislike it. The grave equals all men and\r\n    therefore shall equal me with all princes.... Then the ill\r\n    tongue of a prating fellow or one that hath more tongue than\r\n    wit or more proud than honest shall never trouble me. Wisdom\r\n    is justified of her children. And so much for wormwood.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NICHOLAS CULPEPER FROM \"THE ENGLISH PHYSICIAN\r\n      ENLARGED\"]\r\n\r\nLess popular than Culpeper's numerous writings, but far more\r\nattractive and altogether of a different stamp, are Coles's two books,\r\n_Adam in Eden_ and _The Art of Simpling_. The title of the latter runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Art of Simpling. An Introduction to the Knowledge and\r\n    Gathering of Plants. Wherein the Definitions, Divisions,\r\n    Places, Descriptions, Differences, Names, Vertues, Times of\r\n    flourishing and gathering, Uses, Temperatures, Signatures\r\n    and Appropriations of Plants are methodically laid down.\r\n    London. Printed by J. G. for Nath. Brook at the Angell in\r\n    Cornhill. 1656.\"\r\n\r\nThe preface is quaint and so typical of the spirit of the later\r\nseventeenth-century herbals that I transcribe a good deal of it:--\r\n\r\n    \"What a rare happiness was it for Matthiolus that famous\r\n    Simpler, to live in those days wherein (as he himself\r\n    reports) so many Emperors, Kings, Arch-Dukes, Cardinalls and\r\n    Bishops did favour his Endeavour, and plentifully reward\r\n    him! Whereas in our times the Art of Simpling is so farre\r\n    from being rewarded, that it is grown contemptible and he is\r\n    accounted a simple fellow, that pretends to have any skill\r\n    therein. Truly it is to be lamented that the men of these\r\n    times which pretend to so much Light should goe the way to\r\n    put out their owne Eyes, by trampling upon that which should\r\n    preserve them, to the great discouragement of those that\r\n    have any mind to bend their Studies this way.\r\n    Notwithstanding, for the good of my Native Countrey, which\r\n    everyone is obliged to serve upon all occasions of advantage\r\n    and in pitty to such Mistakers, I have painfully endeavoured\r\n    plainly to demonstrate the way of attaining this necessary\r\n    Art, and the usefulnesse of it, in hopes that this Embryo\r\n    thrown thus into the wide world, will fall into the Lap of\r\n    some worthy persons that will cherish it, though I knew not\r\n    any to whose protection I might commend it. However I have\r\n    adventured it abroad, and to expresse my reall affection to\r\n    the publick good have in it communicated such Notions, as I\r\n    have gathered, either from the reading of Severall Authors,\r\n    or by conferring sometimes with Scholars, and sometimes with\r\n    Countrey people; To which I have added some Observations of\r\n    mine Owne, never before published: Most of which I am\r\n    confident are true, and if there be any that are not so, yet\r\n    they are pleasant.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something very attractive in the last inconsequent remark!\r\n\r\nColes deals mercilessly with old Culpeper. \"Culpeper,\" he says, \"(a\r\nman now dead and therefore I shall speak of him as modestly as I can,\r\nfor were he alive I should be more straight with him), was a man very\r\nignorant in the forme of Simples. Many Books indeed he hath tumbled\r\nover, and transcribed as much out of them as he thought would serve\r\nhis turne (though many times he were therein mistaken) but added very\r\nlittle of his own.\" He even comments on the fact that either Culpeper\r\nor his Printer cannot spell aright--\"sure he or the Printer had not\r\nlearned to spell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Signatures he accepts unquestioningly. \"Though Sin and\r\nSathan have plunged mankinde into an Ocean of Infirmities Yet the\r\nmercy of God which is over all his Workes Maketh Grasse to grow upon\r\nthe Mountaines and Herbs for the use of Men and hath not onely stemped\r\nupon them (as upon every man) a distinct forme, but also given them\r\nparticular signatures, whereby a Man may read even in legible\r\nCharacters the Use of them. Heart Trefoyle is so called not onely\r\nbecause the Leafe is Triangular like the Heart of a Man, but also\r\nbecause each leafe contains the perfect Icon of an Heart and that in\r\nits proper colour viz a flesh colour. Hounds tongue hath a forme not\r\nmuch different from its name which will tye the Tongues of Hounds so\r\nthat they shall not barke at you: if it be laid under the bottomes of\r\nones feet. Wallnuts bear the whole Signature of the Head, the\r\noutwardmost green barke answerable to the thick skin whereunto the\r\nhead is covered, and a salt made of it is singularly good for wounds\r\nin that part, as the Kernell is good for the braines, which it\r\nresembles being environed with a shell which imitates the Scull, and\r\nthen it is wrapped up againe in a silken covering somewhat\r\nrepresenting the _Pia Mater_.\"\r\n\r\nOf those plants that have no signatures he warns the reader not to\r\nconclude hastily that therefore they have no use. \"We must cast\r\nourselves,\" he says, \"with great Courage and Industry (as some before\r\nus have done) upon attempting the vertues of them, which are yet\r\nundiscovered. For man was not brought into the world to live like an\r\nidle Loyterer or Truant, but to exercise his minde in those things,\r\nwhich are therefore in some measure obscure and intricate, yet not so\r\nmuch as otherwise they would have been, it being easier to adde than\r\ninvent at first.\" He then gives his own curious but naïvely\r\ninteresting theory of plants \"commonly accounted useless and\r\nunprofitable.\" \"They would not be without their use,\" he argues, \"if\r\nthey were good for nothing else but to exercise the Industry of Man to\r\nweed them out who, had he nothing to struggle with, the fire of his\r\nSpirit would be halfe extinguished in the Flesh.\" After pointing out\r\nthat weeding them out is in itself excellent exercise, he\r\nproceeds:--\"But further why may not poysonous plants draw to them all\r\nthe maligne juice and nourishment that the other may be more pure and\r\nrefined, as well as Toads and other poysonous Serpents licke the\r\nvenome from the Earth?... So have I seen some people when they have\r\nburned their fingers to goe and burne them again to fetch out the\r\nfire. And why may not one poyson fetch out another as well as fire\r\nfetch out fire?\" \"For should all things be known at once,\" he wisely\r\nconcludes, \"Posterity would have nothing left wherewith to gratifie\r\nthemselves in their owne discoveries, which is a great encouragement\r\nto active and quick Wits, to make them enquire into those things which\r\nare hid from the eyes of those which are dull and stupid.\"\r\n\r\nColes's _Art of Simpling_ is the only herbal which devotes a chapter\r\nto herbs useful for animals--\"Plants as have operation upon the bodies\r\nof Bruit Beasts.\" This chapter is full of curious folk lore. He gives\r\nthe old beliefs that a toad poisoned by a spider will cure itself with\r\na plantain leaf; that weasels when about to encounter a serpent eat\r\nrue; that an ass when it feels melancholy eats asplenium; that wild\r\ngoats wounded by arrows cure themselves with dittany; that the swallow\r\nuses celandine (\"I would have this purposely planted for them,\" he\r\nadds); that linnet and goldfinch (and have any birds brighter eyes?)\r\nconstantly repair their own and their young one's eyesight with\r\neyebright; that if loosestrife is thrown between two oxen when they\r\nare fighting they will part presently, and being tied about their\r\nnecks it will keep them from fighting; that cocks which have been fed\r\non garlick are \"most stout to fight and so are Horses\"; that the\r\nserpent so hates the ash tree \"that she will not come nigh the shadow\r\nof it, but she delights in Fennel very much, which she eates to cleer\r\nher eyesight;\" that, if a garden is infested with moles, garlic or\r\nleeks will make them \"leap out of the ground presently.\" Perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable effects of herbs are the two following. \"Adders tongue\r\nput into the left eare of any Horse will make him fall downe as if he\r\nwere dead, and when it is taken out againe, he becomes more lively\r\nthan he was before.\" And \"if Asses chance to feed much upon Hemlock,\r\nthey will fall so fast asleep that they will seeme to be dead, in so\r\nmuch that some thinking them to be dead indeed have flayed off their\r\nskins, yet after the Hemlock had done operating they have stirred and\r\nwakened out of their sleep, to the griefe and amazement of the\r\nowners.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one chapter--\"Of plants used in and against Witchcraft\"--in\r\nwhich, amongst other things, we learn that the ointment that witches\r\nuse is made of the fat of children, dug up from their graves, and\r\nmixed with the juice of smallage, wolfsbane and cinquefoil and fine\r\nwheat flour; that mistletoe, angelica, etc. were regarded as being of\r\nsuch sovereign power against witches that they were worn round the\r\nneck as amulets. Also, that in order to prevent witches from entering\r\ntheir houses the common people used to gather elder leaves on the last\r\nday of April and affix them to their doors and windows. \"I doe not\r\ndesire any to pin their Faiths upon these reports,\" says Coles, \"but\r\nonly let them know there are such which they may believe as they\r\nplease.\" \"However,\" he concludes, \"there is no question but very\r\nwonderful effects may be wrought by the Vertues which are enveloped\r\nwithin the compasse of the green mantles wherewith many Plants are\r\nadorned.\"\r\n\r\nColes, nevertheless, treats with scorn, and by arguments peculiarly\r\nhis own, the old belief in the connection between the stars and herbs.\r\n\"It [the study of herbs] is a subject as antient as the Creation, yea\r\nmore antient than the Sunne or the Moon, or Starres, they being\r\ncreated on the fourth day whereas Plants were the third. Thus did God\r\neven at first confute the folly of those Astrologers who goe about to\r\nmaintaine that all vegetables in their growth are enslaved to a\r\nnecessary and unavoidable dependence on the influences of the starres;\r\nwhereas Plants were even when Planets were not.\" In another passage,\r\nhowever, he writes, \"Though I admit not of Master Culpeper's\r\nAstrologicall way of every Planets Dominion over Plants, yet I\r\nconceive that the Sunne and Moon have generall influence upon them,\r\nthe one for Heat the other for Moisture; wherein the being of Plants\r\nconsists.\"\r\n\r\nThe most attractive parts of the _Art of Simpling_ are the chapters\r\ndevoted to the \"Joys of Gardening.\" Coles tells us that \"A house,\r\nthough otherwise beautifull, if it hath no garden is more like a\r\nprison than a house.\" Of what he has to say about gardens and the\r\nhappiness to be found in gardening I quote much because it is all so\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\"That there is no place more pleasant [than a garden] may appear from\r\nGod himselfe, who after he had made Man, planted the Garden of Eden,\r\nand put him therein, that he might contemplate the many wonderful\r\nOrnaments wherewith Omnipotency had bedecked his Mother Earth.... As\r\nfor recreation, if a man be wearied with over-much study (for study is\r\na weariness to the Flesh as Solomon by experience can tell you) there\r\nis no better place in the world to recreate himself than a Garden,\r\nthere being no sence but may be delighted therein. If his sight be\r\nobfuscated and dull, as it may easily be, with continuall poring,\r\nthere is no better way to relieve it, than to view the pleasant\r\ngreennesse of Herbes, which is the way that Painters use, when they\r\nhave almost spent their sight by their most earnest contemplation of\r\nbrighter objects: neither doe they onely feed the Eyes but comfort the\r\nwearied Braine with fragrant smells. The Eares also (which are called\r\nthe Daughters of Musick, because they delight therein) have their\r\nrecreation by the pleasant noise of the warbling notes, which the\r\nchaunting birds accent forth from amongst the murmuring Leaves....\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the profits\" [of a garden] he says, \"First for household\r\noccasions, for there is not a day passeth over our heads but we have\r\nof one thing or other that groweth within their circumference. We\r\ncannot make so much as a little good Pottage without Herbes, which\r\ngive an admirable relish and make them wholsome for our Bodies....\r\nBesides this inestimable Profit there is another not much inferior to\r\nit, and that is the wholsome exercise a man may use in it.... If\r\nGentlemen which have little else to doe, would be ruled by me, I\r\nwould advise them to spend their spare time in their gardens, either\r\nin digging, setting, weeding or the like, then which there is no\r\nbetter way in the world to preserve health. If a man want an Appetite\r\nto his Victuals the Smell of the Earth new turned up by digging with a\r\nspade will procure it,[125] and if he be inclined to a Consumption it\r\nwill recover him.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlewomen if the ground be not too wet may doe themselves much good\r\nby kneeling upon a Cushion and weeding. And thus both sexes might\r\ndivert themselves from Idlenesse and evill company, which oftentimes\r\nprove the ruine of many ingenious people. But perhaps they may think\r\nit a disparagement to the condition they are in; truly none at all if\r\nit were but put in practise. For we see that those fashions which\r\nsometimes seem ridiculous if once taken up by the gentry cease to be\r\nso.\" He quotes the Emperor Diocletian, who \"left for a season the\r\nwhole Government of the Empire and forsaking the Court betook himself\r\nto a meane House with a Garden adjoyning, wherein with his owne hands,\r\nhe both sowed set and weeded the Herbes of his Garden which kinde of\r\nlife so pleased him, that he was hardly intreated to resume the\r\nGovernment of the Empire.\" \"By this time,\" he concludes, \"I hope you\r\nwill think it no dishonour to follow the steps of our grandsire Adam,\r\nwho is commonly pictured with a Spade in his hand, to march through\r\nthe Quarters of your Garden with the like Instrument, and there to\r\nrectify all the disorders thereof, to procure as much as in you lyes\r\nthe recovery of the languishing Art of Simpling, which did it but\r\nappeare in lively colours, I am almost perswaded it would so affect\r\nyou that you would be much taken with it. There is no better way to\r\nunderstand the benefit of it, than by being acquainted with Herballs\r\nand Herbarists and by putting this Gentle and ingenious Exercise in\r\npractise, that so this part of knowledge as well as others, may\r\nreceive that esteem and advancement that is due to it, to the\r\nbanishment of Barbarisme and Ignorance which begin again to prevaile\r\nagainst it.\"\r\n\r\nThe real descendants, so to speak, of the herbal are the quaint old\r\nstill-room books, many of which survive not only in museums and public\r\nlibraries, but also in country houses. These still-room books, which\r\nare a modest branch of literature in themselves, are more nearly akin\r\nto herbals than to cookery books, with which they are popularly\r\nassociated. For they are full of the old herb lore and of the uses of\r\nherbs in homely medicines. It must be remembered that even as late as\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries every woman was supposed to\r\nhave some knowledge of both the preparation and the medicinal use of\r\nherbs and simples. When the herbal proper ceased and the first books\r\non botany began to make their appearance the old herb lore did not\r\nfall into disuse, and the popularity of the still-room books in which\r\nit was preserved may be gathered from the fact that one of the first\r\nof these to be printed--_A Choice Manual of rare and select Secrets in\r\nPhysick & Chirurgerie Collected and practised by the Countesse of\r\nKent[126] (late dec'd)_--went through nineteen editions. There are\r\nsome old books which merely inspire awe, for one feels that they have\r\nalways lived in dignified seclusion on library shelves and have been\r\nhandled only by learned scholars. But there are others whose leaves\r\nare so be-thumbed and torn that from constant association with human\r\nbeings they seem to have become almost human themselves. Of this type\r\nare these old still-room books. They were an integral part of daily\r\nlife and their worn pages bear mute witness to the fact.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FRONTISPIECE OF \"THE CURIOUS DESTILLATORY,\" BY\r\n      THOMAS SHIRLEY, M.D., PHYSICIAN IN ORDINARY TO HIS MAJESTY\r\n      (1677)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting is the Fairfax still-room book.[127] Its\r\nfirst owner was probably Mary Cholmeley, born during the closing\r\nyears of Elizabeth's reign, and married in 1626 to the Rev. the Hon.\r\nHenry Fairfax (uncle of the great Parliamentarian General--Lord\r\nFairfax).[128] In common with the majority of MS. still-room books,\r\nthe Fairfax volume contains much that has no immediate connection with\r\na still-room, but is full of human interest. It is a curious medley of\r\nculinary recipes, homely cures, housewifely arts such as bleaching,\r\ndyeing, brewing and preserving, to say nothing of hastily scribbled\r\nlittle notes regarding lost linen (including no fewer than \"xxiii\r\nhandkerchares!\") and the number of fowls, etc., in the poultry-yard.\r\nThis last entry, which runs all down one side of a page, is as\r\nfollows: \"I Kapon, XVI Torkies, XVIII dowkes, IIII henes, II cokes, X\r\nchekins, X giese, IV sowes.\"\r\n\r\nBut the most charming entry of all is: \"A note of Mistress Barbara her\r\nlessons on ye virginalle which she hath learned and can play them,\"\r\nfollowed by a list of songs, the majority of which have the entry \"Mr.\r\nBird\" beside them. William Bird was organist to Queen Elizabeth, and\r\nhe presumably was \"Mistress Barbara's\" music-master. She apparently\r\nalso had lessons from Dr. Bull, then at the height of his fame, for\r\nhis name appears in connection with some of the items. Amongst the\r\nsongs we find \"My trew Love is to ye grene Wood gon,\" and there are\r\nquite a number of dances--pavanes and courantes--which she played. One\r\nfeels very sure that \"Mistress Barbara\" was a fascinating person, but\r\nshe could not have been more lovable than her sister Mary, who married\r\nHenry Fairfax. A love-letter, written in Charles I.'s reign, is\r\ndoubtless quite out of place in a book on old herbals, but I cannot\r\nrefrain from quoting the following, written by Mary to her husband\r\nabout six years after their marriage, because it very clearly reveals\r\nthe character of one of the many types of women who wrote these\r\nstill-room books.\r\n\r\n    \"MY EVER DEAREST LOVE,\r\n\r\n    \"I received a letter and horse from Long on Thursday (Jan.\r\n    31) and will use meine [endeavour] to send Procter's horse\r\n    to Denton.

Take Mallowes, pellitory of\r\n    the wall, of each three handfulls; Camomell flowers,\r\n    Mellilot flowers, of each one handfull; hollyhocks, two\r\n    handfulls; Isop one greate handfull, senerick seede one\r\n    ounce, and boil them in nine gallons of Water untill they\r\n    come to three, then put in a quart of new milke and go into\r\n    it bloud warme or somthing warmer.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Balles for the face.

In his paper[129] on this MS.\r\nDr. Guthrie quotes many of these recipes, amongst them one from the\r\nfamous Dr. Stephens,[130] so frequently quoted by Sir Kenelm Digby and\r\nin other still-room books of the period. In Lady Sedley's book his\r\nrecipe is introduced thus: \"A copy to make the sovreigns't water that\r\never was devised by man, which Dr. Stephens a physician of great\r\ncuning and of long experience did use and therewith did cure many\r\ngreat cases, and all was kept in secret until a little before his\r\ndeath; when the Archbishop of Canterbury got it from him.\" Amongst the\r\nother contributors to this MS. were no fewer than three of the doctors\r\nwho attended Charles II. in his last illness, and if they gave the\r\nking even in a mild form medicines resembling those we find in this\r\nbook, Macaulay's description that \"they tortured him for some hours\r\nlike an Indian at the stake\" can hardly have been exaggerated. There\r\nis a \"Receipt for Convulsion Fitts\" from Sir Edward Greaves (the first\r\nphysician to be created a baronet) consisting of peony roots, dead\r\nman's skull, hoofs of asses, white amber and bezoar; and the famous\r\nDr. Sydenham contributed a \"Prescription for the head\" in which, not\r\ncontent with the seventy-two ingredients of which Venice treacle\r\nconsisted, he added Wormwood, orange peel, angelica and nutmeg.\r\nAnother distinguished contributor to this MS. was the ill-fated Duke\r\nof Monmouth. A prescription for stone from Judge Ellis consisted of\r\nVenice turpentine distilled with various herbs and spices in small\r\nale. It was to be made only in June and taken \"three days before the\r\nfull and three days before the change of the Moone\" (incidentally a\r\nsurvival of Saxon moon lore), but the Duke of Monmouth's prescription\r\nfor the same complaint is quite different and is compounded of ripe\r\nhaws and fennel roots distilled in white wine and taken with syrup of\r\nelder. Lady Sedley, the first owner, and presumably author of the\r\nbook, was the wife of Sir Charles Sedley, one of Charles II.'s\r\nintimate friends and notorious for his mad pranks. Between her husband\r\nand her daughter her life must have been almost unbearable, and it is\r\nnot surprising that the unfortunate woman ended her days in a\r\nmad-house.\r\n\r\nOf the MS. still-room books in the British Museum undoubtedly the most\r\ninteresting is _Mary Doggett: Her Book of Receipts_, 1682.[131] On the\r\nfirst page is affixed a note: \"This Mary Doggett was the wife of\r\nDoggett the Player who left a legacy of a yearly coat and badge to be\r\nrowed for.\"[132] The MS. is beautifully written and contains an\r\nastonishing amount of information on every housewifely art, from\r\nwashing \"parti-coloured stockings\" to making perfumes and \"Sweete\r\nBaggs.\" Indeed the reading of the headlines alone gives one some idea\r\nof the multifarious duties of a mistress of a large house in those\r\ndays. We find--and I quote only a few--recipes \"to make morello cherry\r\ncakes,\" \"apricock marmalett,\" \"to preserve Cherrys white,\" \"to candy\r\noranges or lemons or any kind of sucketts,\" \"to preserve almonds,\" \"to\r\npreserve damsons,\" \"orange butter,\" \"pippin creame,\" \"to make molds\r\nfor apricock Plumbs,\" \"apricock wine,\" \"to keep cherrys all the year,\"\r\n\"to make cowslip wine,\" \"cakes of clove gilly flowers,\" \"curran wine,\"\r\n\"grapes in jelly,\" \"cleer cakes of goosberys,\" \"fine cakes of lemons,\"\r\n\"to preserve Rasps whole,\" \"to make Lemon Creame,\" \"lemon Syllibub,\"\r\n\"orange biskett,\" \"cheese caks of oranges,\" \"to preserve pippins in\r\nslices,\" \"to make plumb biskett,\" \"to pickle Quinces,\" \"to preserve\r\nWallnutts,\" \"to preserve double blew violetts for Salletts,\" \"to candy\r\nDouble marygold, Roses, or any other flowers,\" \"to make good sorrell\r\nwine,\" \"sweet powders for linnen,\" \"to perfume gloves after the\r\nSpanish maner,\" \"to souse a pigg,\" \"Almond milk,\" \"to pickle\r\ncucumbers,\" \"drinks to cause sleep,\" \"snaile broth,\" \"plasters for\r\nbruises,\" \"to make pomades\" and \"past for the hands.\" The receipts for\r\n\"A Pomander,\" for \"Balme water,\" \"to dry roses for sweet powder,\" and\r\n\"a perfume for a sweet bagg\" are particularly attractive, and I give\r\nthem below.\r\n\r\n\"A Pomander. Take a quarter of an ounce of Civitt, a quarter and a\r\nhalf-quarter of an ounce of Ambergreese, not half a quarter of an\r\nounce of ye Spiritt of Roses, 7 ounces of Benjamin, allmost a pound of\r\nDamask Rose buds cutt. Lay gumdragon in rose water and with it make up\r\nyour Pomander, with beads as big as nutmegs and color ym with Lamb\r\n[_sic_] black; when you make ym up wash your hands wth oyle of Jasmin\r\nto smooth ym, then make ym have a gloss, this quantity will make\r\nseaven Braceletes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A receipt for Balme. Take 6 or 7 handfulls of balme, cut it a little,\r\nput it in an Earthen pott wth a handfull of cowslip flowers, green or\r\ndry, half an ounce of Mace, a little bruised pow[d]er in ym, 4 quarts\r\nof strong ale, let ym stand a night to infuse: in ye morning put it\r\ninto your still, poure upon it a quart of brandy. Past up your Still;\r\nyou may draw about 2 quarts of water. Sweeten it with Sugar to your\r\nTast and tye up too pennyworth of Saffron in a ragg, put it into ye\r\nwater and let it lye till it be colored. Squeeze it out and bottle it\r\nfor your use.\"\r\n\r\n\"To dry Roses for sweet powder. Take your Roses after they have layen\r\n2 or 3 days on a Table, then put them into a dish and sett ym on a\r\nchafering dish of Charcole, keeping them stirred, and as you stir ym\r\nstrew in some powder of orris, and when you see them pretty dry put\r\nthem into a gally pot till you use them.\"\r\n\r\n\"A perfume for a sweet bagg. Take half a pound of Cypress Roots, a\r\npound of Orris, 3 quarters of a pound of Rhodium, a pound of Coriander\r\nSeed, 3 quarter of a pound of Calamus, 3 orange stick wth cloves, 2\r\nounces of Benjamin, and an ounce of Storax and 4 pecks of Damask Rose\r\nleaves, a peck of dryed sweet Marjerum, a pretty stick of Juniper\r\nshaved very thin, some lemon pele dryed and a stick of Brasill; let\r\nall these be powdered very grosely for ye first year and immediately\r\nput into your baggs; the next year pound and work it and it will be\r\nvery good again.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Countesse of Kent's\" still-room book, which was one of the first\r\nto be published, contains more recipes against the Plague than most,\r\nand with one of these we find the instruction that it must be taken\r\nthree times, \"for the first helpeth not.\" Amongst much that is\r\ngruesome there is a pleasant recipe entitled \"A comfortable cordial to\r\ncheer the heart,\" which runs thus: \"Take one ounce of conserve of\r\ngilliflowers, four grains of the best Musk, bruised as fine as flower,\r\nthen put it into a little tin pot and keep it till you have need to\r\nmake this cordial following: Viz.: Take the quantity of one Nutmeg out\r\nof your tin pot, put to it one spoonful of cinnamon water, and one\r\nspoonful of the sirrup of gillifloures, ambergreece, mix all these\r\ntogether and drink them in the morning, fasting three or four hours,\r\nthis is most comfortable.\" The _chef d'[oe]uvre_ of the collection, at\r\nleast in the author's opinion, is one introduced with this flourish,\r\nbut it is too long for me to quote more than the comprehensive\r\ntitle:--\"The Countesse of Kent's powder, good against all malignant\r\nand pestilent diseases, French Pox, Small Pox, Measles, Plague,\r\nPestilence, Malignant or Scarlet Feavers, good against melancholy,\r\ndejection of Spirits, twenty or thirty grains thereof being exhibited\r\nin a little warm Sack or Hartshorn Jelly to a Man and half as much or\r\ntwelve grains to a Childe.\"\r\n\r\nFar more attractive than the volume which bears the \"Countesse of\r\nKent's\" name are the little-known books by Tryon. They are full of\r\ndiscourses and sermons, introduced at the most unexpected moments.\r\nIndeed, there are few subjects on which Tryon does not lecture his\r\nreaders, from giving servants extra work on Sundays by having \"greasy\r\nplatters and Bloody-Bones more on Sunday than any other Day,\" to\r\nsleeping in feather beds. It is interesting to find that women had\r\nalready taken to smoking in the seventeenth century, and Tryon\r\nadmonishes them thus:--\"Nor is it become infrequent, for women also to\r\nsmoak Tobacco. Tobacco being an Herb of Mars and Saturn, it hath its\r\nfiery Quality from Mars, and its Poysonous fulsome attractive Nature\r\nfrom Saturn: the common use of it in Pipes is very injurious to all\r\nsorts of people but more especially to the Female Sex.\" Tryon seems to\r\nhave been somewhat of a Socialist, and he takes great delight in\r\ncommiserating \"Lords, Aldermen, the Rich and the Great,\" who are\r\ndriven to \"heartily envying those Jolley Swains, who feed only with\r\nBread and Cheese, and trotting up to the knees in Dirt, do yet with\r\nlusty limbs, and vigorous stomach, and merry Hearts, and undisturbed\r\nHeads, whistle out more sollid joys than the others, with all their\r\nWealth and State can purchase.\"\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all still-room books was that written by Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, the friend of Kings and philosophers and himself a man of\r\nscience, a doctor, an occultist, a privateer and a herbalist. Indeed\r\nit would be impossible to catalogue his activities, and he has always\r\nbeen recognised as the type _par excellence_ of the gifted amateur.\r\nSir Kenelm was the elder son of the Digby who was one of the leaders\r\nin the Gunpowder Plot. Himself a man of European reputation, he\r\nnumbered among his friends Bacon, Ben Jonson, Galileo, Descartes,\r\nHarvey and Cromwell. Queen Marie de' Medici was only one of many women\r\nwho fell in love with him, but his one love was his wife, one of the\r\nmost beautiful women of her day--Venetia Anastasia Stanley,\r\nimmortalised by Van Dyck and Ben Jonson. Sir Kenelm Digby was the\r\nintimate friend of Charles I. and Henrietta Maria, and after the\r\nRestoration he was a prominent figure at the Court of Charles II. When\r\nthe Royal Society was inaugurated in 1663, he was one of the Council,\r\nand his house in Covent Garden was a centre where all the wits,\r\noccultists and men of letters forgathered. Aubrey tells us that after\r\nthe Restoration he lived \"in the last faire house westward in the\r\nnorth portico of Covent Garden where my lord Denzill Hollis lived\r\nsince. He had a laboratory there.\"[133] One reads so much of the\r\nextravagances and excesses of Restoration days that it is all the\r\npleasanter to remember the people of whom little has been written, the\r\nthousands of quiet folk who loved their homes and gardens and took\r\ndelight in simple pleasures. It is of these people Sir Kenelm Digby's\r\nbook reminds us, and even the names of his recipes are soothing\r\nreading--syllabubs, hydromel, mead, quidannies, tansies,\r\nslipp-coat-cheeses, manchets, and so forth. Moreover, there is no\r\nsavour of the shop in these recipes, the book being full rather of\r\nflowers and herbs. It is also very leisurely, and in these days that,\r\ntoo, is soothing. Time we frequently find measured thus:--\"Whiles you\r\ncan say the Miserere Psalm very slowly\" or \"about an Ave Maria while.\"\r\nIt takes us back to a simple old world when great ladies not only\r\nlooked well to the ways of their households, but attended themselves\r\nto the more important domestic matters. Sir Kenelm collected these\r\nrecipes assiduously from his friends, and each housekeeper's pride in\r\nher speciality is very evident. To mention only a few of these, we\r\nfind:--\"Scotch Ale from my Lady Holmeby,\" \"A very pleasant drink of\r\nApples,\" \"Master Webb's Ale and Bragot,\" \"Apples in Gelly,\" \"To make\r\nBisket,\" \"Sir Paul Neal's way of making Cider,\" \"My Lord of St.\r\nAlban's Cresme Fouettee,\" \"The Queen's Barley Cream,\" \"To pickle\r\ncapons my Lady Portland's way,\" \"Pickled Champignons,\" \"A\r\nFlomery-Caudle,\" \"My Lord Hollis Hydromel,\" \"Master Corsellises\r\nAntwerp Meath,\" \"My own considerations for making of Meathe,\" \"Meathe\r\nfrom the Muscovian Ambassadors Steward,\" \"White Metheglin of my Lady\r\nHungerford's which is exceedingly praised,\" \"My Lord of Denbigh's\r\nAlmond March-pane,\" \"My Lord Lumley's Pease-pottage,\" \"Pease of the\r\nseed, buds of Tulips,\" \"A soothing Quiddany or Gelly of the Cores of\r\nQuinces,\" \"Sack with clove gilly-flowers,\" \"My Lord of Carlile's\r\nSack-posset,\" \"To make a whip Syllabub,\" \"Sucket of Mallow-stalks,\"\r\n\"The Countess of Newport's Cherry Wine.\" We may forget the recipes\r\nthemselves, but the memory of them is associated with the fragrance of\r\ngillifiowers, roses, cowslips, elder flowers, violets, thyme, marjoram\r\nand the like. I give but these few below, and I wish there were space\r\nfor more; for not only are they excellent in themselves, but, in\r\ncommon with all those in Sir Kenelm Digby's book, they give more,\r\nperhaps, of the atmosphere of the old still-rooms than is to be found\r\nin any other collection.\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet meat of Apples. My Lady Barclay makes her fine\r\n    Apple-gelly with slices of John apples. Sometimes she\r\n    mingles a few pippins with the Johns to make the gelly. But\r\n    she liketh best the Johns single and the colour is paler.\r\n    You first fill the glass with slices round-wise cut, and\r\n    then the Gelly is poured in to fill up the vacuities. The\r\n    Gelly must be boiled to a good stiffness. Then when it is\r\n    ready to take from the fire, you put in some juyce of Lemon,\r\n    and of Orange too, if you like it, but these must not boil;\r\n    yet it must stand a while upon the fire stewing in good\r\n    heat, to have the juyces incorporate and penetrate well. You\r\n    must also put in some Ambergreece, which doth exceeding well\r\n    in this sweet-meat.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Wheaten Flommery. In the West Country they make a kind of\r\n    Flommery of wheat flower, which they judge to be more harty\r\n    and pleasant then that of Oat-meal, thus; take half, or a\r\n    quarter of a bushel of good Bran of the best wheat (which\r\n    containeth the purest flower of it, though little, and is\r\n    used to make starch), and in a great wooden bowl or pail,\r\n    let it soak with cold water upon it three or four days. Then\r\n    strain out the milky water from it, and boil it up to a\r\n    gelly or like starch. Which you may season with Sugar and\r\n    Rose or Orange-flower-water and let it stand till it be\r\n    cold, and gellied. Then eat it with white or Rhenish-wine,\r\n    or Cream, or Milk, or Ale.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A Flomery Caudle. When Flomery is made and cold, you may\r\n    make a pleasant and wholesome caudle of it by taking some\r\n    lumps and spoonfuls of it, and boil it with Ale and White\r\n    wine, then sweeten it to your taste with Sugar. There will\r\n    remain in the Caudle some lumps of the congealed flomery\r\n    which are not ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Conserve of Red Roses. Doctor Glisson makes his Conserve of\r\n    red Roses thus: Boil gently a pound of red Rose-leaves (well\r\n    picked, and the nails cut off) in about a pint and a half\r\n    (or a little more, as by discretion you shall judge fit,\r\n    after having done it once; the Doctor's Apothecary takes two\r\n    pints) of Spring water; till the water have drawn out all\r\n    the Tincture of the Roses into itself, and that the leaves\r\n    be very tender, and look pale like Linnen; which may be in a\r\n    good half hour, or an hour, keeping the pot covered whiles\r\n    it boileth. Then pour the tincted Liquor from the pale\r\n    leaves (strain it out, pressing it gently, so that you may\r\n    have Liquor enough to dissolve your Sugar) and set it upon\r\n    the fire by itself to boil, putting into it a pound of pure\r\n    double refined Sugar in small Powder; which as soon as it is\r\n    dissolved, put into it a second pound, then a third, lastly\r\n    a fourth, so that you have four pounds of sugar to every\r\n    pound of Rose-leaves. (The Apothecary useth to put all the\r\n    four pounds into the Liquor altogether at once.) Boil these\r\n    four pounds of Sugar with the tincted Liquor, till it be a\r\n    high Syrup, very near a candy height (as high as it can be\r\n    not to flake or candy). Then put the pale Rose-leaves into\r\n    this high Syrup, as it yet standeth upon the fire, or\r\n    immediately upon the taking it off the fire. But presently\r\n    take it from the fire, and stir them exceeding well\r\n    together, to mix them uniformly; then let them stand till\r\n    they be cold, then pot them up. If you put your Conserve\r\n    into pots whiles it is yet thoroughly warm, and leave them\r\n    uncovered some days, putting them in the hot Sun or stove,\r\n    there will grow a fine candy on the top, which will preserve\r\n    the conserve without paper upon it, from moulding, till you\r\n    break the candied crust to take out some of the conserve.\r\n\r\n    \"The colour both of the Rose-leaves and the Syrup about\r\n    them, will be exceedingly beautiful and red, and the taste\r\n    excellent, and the whole very tender and smoothing, and\r\n    easie to digest in the stomack without clogging it, as doth\r\n    the ordinary rough conserve made of raw Roses beaten with\r\n    Sugar, which is very rough in the throat. The worst of it\r\n    is, that if you put not a Paper to lie always close upon the\r\n    top of the conserve, it will be apt to grow mouldy there on\r\n    the top; especially après que le pot est entamé.\"\r\n\r\nUnder another \"conserve of red roses\" we find this note:--\"Doctor\r\nBacon useth to make a pleasant Julip of this Conserve of Roses, by\r\nputting a good spoonful of it into a large drinking glass or cup; upon\r\nwhich squeeze the juyce made of a Lemon, and slip in unto it a little\r\nof the yellow rinde of the Lemon; work these well together with the\r\nback of a spoon, putting water to it by little and little, till you\r\nhave filled up the glass with Spring water: so drink it. He sometimes\r\npasseth it through an Hypocras bag and then it is a beautiful and\r\npleasant Liquor.\"\r\n\r\nThese still-room books are as much part of a vanished past as the old\r\nherb-gardens, those quiet enclosures full of sunlight and delicious\r\nscents, of bees and fairies, which we foolish moderns have allowed to\r\nfall into disuse. The herb garden was always the special domain of the\r\nhousewife, and one likes to think of the many generations of fair\r\nwomen who made these gardens their own, tending them with their own\r\nhands, rejoicing in their beauty and peace and interpreting in humble,\r\nhuman fashion something of the wonder and mystery of Nature in the\r\nloveliness of a garden enclosed. For surely this was the charm of\r\nthese silent secluded places, so far removed from turmoil that from\r\nthem it was possible to look at the world with clear eyes and a mind\r\nundisturbed by clamour. And what of the fairies in those gardens? We\r\nlive in such a hurrying, material age that even in our gardens we seem\r\nto have forgotten the fairies, who surely have the first claim on\r\nthem. Does not every child know that fairies love thyme and foxgloves\r\nand the lavish warm scent of the old cabbage rose? Surely the fairies\r\nthronged to those old herb-gardens as to a familiar haunt. Can you not\r\nsee them dancing in the twilight?\r\n\r\nThe dark elves of Saxon days have well-nigh vanished with the bogs and\r\nmarshes and the death-like vapours which gave them birth. With the\r\npassing of centuries the lesser elves have become tiny of stature and\r\nfriendly to man, warming themselves by our firesides and disporting\r\nthemselves in our gardens. Perhaps now they even look to us for\r\nprotection, lest in this age of materialism they be driven altogether\r\nfrom the face of the earth. As early as the twelfth century we find\r\nmention of creatures akin to the brownies, whom we all love; for the\r\nserious Gervase of Tilbury tells us of these goblins, less than half\r\nan inch high, having faces wrinkled with age, and dressed in patched\r\ngarments. These little creatures, he assures us, come and work at\r\nnight in the houses of mankind; but they had not lost their impish\r\nways and elvish tricks, \"for at times when Englishmen ride abroad in\r\nthe darkness of night, an unseen Portunos [Brownie?] will join\r\ncompany with the wayfarer; and after riding awhile by his side will at\r\nlength seize his reins and lead his horse into the slough wherein he\r\nwill stick and wallow while the Portunos departs with mocking\r\nlaughter, thus making sport of man's simplicity.\" Perhaps they still\r\nmake sport of our simplicity, but we shall be the losers if they\r\nvanish altogether from the earth. If in impish mood they lead the\r\nwayfarer into sloughs, do not the sheen-bright elves lighten some of\r\nthe darkest paths of pain which human beings are forced to tread? Are\r\nnot these Ariel-like creatures links between the flowers of earth\r\nwhich they haunt and the stars of heaven whence they seem to derive\r\ntheir radiance? The fairies have almost deserted us, but perhaps they\r\nwill one day come back to our gardens and teach us that there is\r\nsomething true, though beyond what we can know, in the old\r\nastrological lore of the close secret communion between stars and\r\nflowers. Do not flowers seem to reflect in microscopic form those\r\nglorious flowers which deck the firmament of heaven? In many flowers\r\nthere is something so star-like that almost unconsciously our minds\r\nconnect them with the luminaries in the great expanse above us, and\r\nfrom this it seems but a short step to the belief that there is\r\nbetween them a secret communion which is past our understanding.\r\n\r\n    \"This is the enchantment, this the exaltation,\r\n    The all-compensating wonder,\r\n    Giving to common things wild kindred\r\n    With the gold-tesserate floors of Jove;\r\n    Linking such heights and such humilities,\r\n    Hand in hand in ordinal dances,\r\n    That I do think my tread,\r\n    Stirring the blossoms in the meadow-grass\r\n    Flickers the unwithering stars.\"[134]\r\n\r\nMystics of all ages and of all civilisations have felt this secret\r\nbond between what are surely the most beautiful of God's\r\ncreations--flowers and stars; and its fascination is in no small part\r\ndue to the exquisite frailty and short-lived beauty of the flowers of\r\nearth and the stupendous majesty of the flowers in the heavens, those\r\nmyriad worlds in whose existence a thousand years is but as a passing\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n    Goddis grace shall euer endure.\r\n\r\n    (_Inscription at the end of \"The vertuose boke Of\r\n    Dystyllacyon of the waters of all maner of Herbes.\" 1527._)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[124] John Archer (one of the Physicians in Ordinary to Charles II.)\r\nalso asserts in his _Compendious Herbal_ (1673) that \"the Sun doth not\r\ndraw away the Vertues of Herbs, but adds to them.\" Archer gives full\r\nastrological directions for the gathering of herbs:--\r\n\r\n\"I have mentioned in the ensuing Treatise of Herbs the Planet that\r\nRules every Herb for this end, that you may the better understand\r\ntheir Nature and may gather them when they are in their full strength,\r\nwhich is when the Planet is especially strong, and then in his own\r\nHour gather your Herb; therefore that you may know what hour belongs\r\nto every Planet take notice that Astrologers do assign the seven days\r\nof the week to the seven planets, as to the Sun or [~Sun~] Sunday; to\r\nthe Moon or [~Moon~] Monday; to Mars or [~Mars~] Tuesday; to Mercury\r\nor [~Mercury~] Wednesday; to Jupiter or [~Jupiter~] Thursday; to Venus\r\nor [~Venus~] Friday; to Saturn or [~Saturn~] Saturday. And know that\r\nevery Planet governs the first Hour after Sun Rise upon his day and\r\nthe next Planet to him takes the next Hour successively in this order,\r\n[~Saturn~], [~Jupiter~], [~Mars~], [~Sun~], [~Venus~], [~Mercury~],\r\n[~Moon~], [~Saturn~], [~Jupiter~]. So be it any day every Seventh Hour\r\ncomes to each Planet successively, as if the day be Thursday then the\r\nfirst hour after Sun Rising is Jupiter's, the next [~Mars~], the next\r\n[~Sun~], next [~Venus~]. So on till it come to [~Jupiter~] again. And\r\nif you gather Herbs in their Planetary Hour you may expect to do\r\nWonders, otherwise not; to Astrologers I need say nothing; to others\r\nthis is as much as can easily be learnt.\"--_The Compendious Herbal_,\r\nby John Archer, One of his Majesties Physicians in Ordinary.\r\n\r\n[125] In this connection he quotes Dr. Pinck, Warden of New College,\r\nOxford, who, when he was \"almost fourscore yeares old, would rise very\r\nbetimes in the morning and going into his Garden he would take a\r\nMattock or Spade, digging there an hour or two, which he found very\r\nadvantageous to his health.\"\r\n\r\n[126] Published 1651.

The preface is\r\n    singularly beautiful. Though the preface enjoins the name\r\n    \"Ortus Sanitatis, in German, a Garden of Health,\" the title\r\n    in this and subsequent editions is Herbarius zu teutsch.\r\n\r\n  1485 (a few months later than the above). Pirated edition\r\n    printed at Augsburg, probably by Schönsperger. It is\r\n    interesting to note that in this edition a pine cone, the\r\n    badge of Augsburg, appears on the title-page. Figures of\r\n    plants are very inferior to those in the first edition.\r\n\r\n  1486.
