To get the most enjoyment from this pamphlet make a leisurely\r\ntrip—drive slowly. Visitors find it most practical to read about the\r\nnext point of interest before coming to it, often having someone other\r\nthan the driver read this aloud while traveling.\r\n\r\nIn the left hand margin of the text is a series of numbers which\r\ncorrespond to numbered markers along the road marking the point of\r\ninterest. Explanations follow each number in the text. The fume cloud on\r\nthe roadside markers points in the direction of the feature. If you are\r\nentering via Manzanita Lake Entrance Station, start from the last of\r\nthis book, and read the numbers in descending sequence.\r\n\r\nThe mileage shown in parentheses in the center line of the pages\r\nindicates the distance between successive points driving either way.\r\n\r\n                      ALWAYS PARK OFF THE PAVEMENT\r\n                 AN AUTO ACCIDENT WILL SPOIL YOUR TRIP\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: National Park Service]\r\n\r\n                   Published in cooperation with the\r\n                         National Park Service\r\n                      Copyright 1950, 1962 by the\r\n                       Loomis Museum Association\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nLassen Volcanic National Park was established by act of Congress in 1916\r\nfrom lands of the Lassen National Forest and the small Lassen Peak and\r\nCinder Cone National Monuments formerly under the Forest Service, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. The park area now measures approximately 10\r\nby 17 miles, embracing about 165 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe Lassen Park Road is a link in State Route No. 89. It runs through\r\nLassen Volcanic National Park, half circling the east side of Lassen\r\nPeak. This road was built by the National Park Service of the U. S.\r\nDepartment of the Interior to make accessible by car some of the finest\r\nscenery in the park. The road is not designed for high speed. The slower\r\nyou drive the more you will see. Like you, others are sight seeing, so\r\ndrive carefully and observe the warning signs at all times. Remember: an\r\naccident may ruin your vacation, your car, and even your life. Maximum\r\nspeed is 45 miles per hour, but in many places this is excessive.\r\n\r\nWhile using this guide you will want to stop many times. Be sure to park\r\nOFF THE PAVEMENT to prevent accidents. In the spring when heavy\r\nsnowdrifts line the road, it will not be practical to stop in certain\r\nareas, nor will it be possible to see some of the things described in\r\nthis publication.\r\n\r\nOther books dealing in greater detail with the interpretation of the\r\nnatural and human history of the area may be purchased in the Visitor\r\nCenter at Manzanita Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n              A MAP OF THE PARK WILL BE FOUND ON PAGES 18 and 19\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Look for numbered stakes along the road.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1 THE RAKER MEMORIAL was sponsored by the California State Chamber of\r\nCommerce in 1931 in honor of Congressman John E. Raker who was\r\nRepresentative of the State for 15 years. It was he who introduced the\r\nsuccessful bill to Congress recommending the establishment of Lassen\r\nVolcanic National Park. The bill was signed by Pres. Wilson on August 9,\r\n1916. John Raker died in 1926. Appropriately, this is also the boundary\r\nbetween the National Park and Lassen National Forest. Although the\r\nNational Park Service and the National Forest Service differ in\r\nconservation policies, they cooperate very closely on mutual matters,\r\nsuch as forest fire and forest pest control.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Lassen Volcanic National Park stele]\r\n\r\n                               (0.5 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n2 THE BROKEOFF MOUNTAIN TRAIL starts here on the uphill side of the\r\nroad. It is a 3.5 mile hike to the summit at 9,235 feet. The elevation\r\nhere at the road is 6,640 feet.\r\n\r\nThe common shrub-like trees along the first part of the trail are the\r\nmountain alder and willow. (see sketch). In the fall the willow leaves\r\nturn bright yellow. Both species lose their leaves in winter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MT. ALDER]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WILLOW]\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n3 THE NEW SOUTHWEST ENTRANCE STATION was completed in the summer of\r\n1966. Entry permits, which are required during the summer season, are\r\nsold here.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n4 THE VISITOR USE BUILDING was also completed in the summer of 1966. It\r\nis designed primarily for winter use with the ski slopes nearby.\r\nLunches, souvenirs and information may be obtained here in the summer\r\nseason also.\r\n\r\n                               (0.8 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n5 SULPHUR WORKS is the most easily accessible hydrothermal area in the\r\nPark. It is probably part of the central vent system of ancient Mt.\r\nTehama which is described at No. 7. A short paved trail leads to the\r\nsputtering hot springs, steaming fumeroles and hot bubbling mud pots.\r\nFor your own safety be sure to stay on the trails in any of the thermal\r\nareas. Slippery clay and thin crusty coverings could lead to a dunking\r\nin scalding hot water and mud. Most water in the thermal areas of the\r\nPark contain sulphurous or sulphuric acid, so avoid getting it on your\r\nclothes. The odor is mainly that of hydrogen sulphide. Much of the white\r\nclay is tinted yellow, tan or pink by mineral impurities, chiefly iron\r\noxides.\r\n\r\nThe name Sulphur Works was first used in 1865 when efforts were made by\r\nT. M. Boarman and Dr. M. Supan to develop the sulphur and clay\r\npotentialities of the area. This land was filed upon originally as a\r\nmining claim but was actively used only for the tourist trade beginning\r\nabout 1940. Some of the non-acidic thermal water was used for hot baths.\r\nThe property was acquired by the Federal Government in 1951 and added to\r\nthe National Park to be used as a natural thermal area exhibit.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\nIn early summer the flowers along the road for the next mile or two, are\r\nspectacular. Yellow balsam root (with arrowhead-shaped leaves), mules\r\nears (with similar blossoms), and blue stickseed, which looks like\r\nforgetmenot, are the most showy. In late summer tall stalks of false\r\nhellebore and yellow senecio are common.\r\n\r\n                               (0.1 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MULES EARS (yellow)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BALSAM ROOT (yellow)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BLUE STICKSEED]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SENECIO (yellow)]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 ELEVATION 7,000 FEET. Just ahead is a magnificent specimen of western\r\nwhite pine. Being one of the white pine group, it has five needles in a\r\nbundle. Its cone is about ⅓ the size of its near relative of lower\r\n(Transition Life Zone) elevations, the sugar pine. Its limbs grow far\r\ndown on the trunk because they get plenty of light for the manufacture\r\nof food. Shading in dense forests causes a sloughing off of lower limbs,\r\nresulting in natural pruning.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WESTERN WHITE PINE (five needles)\r\n    Mature Cone, 6 in. Young Cones and Foliage]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 BROKEOFF MOUNTAIN, the second highest peak in the park. The volcanic\r\nlava and ash layers are abruptly broken off on the north side, hence the\r\nname “Brokeoff”. This mountain is a flank remnant of ancestral Mount\r\nTehama which once towered more than 1,000 feet higher than Lassen Peak.\r\nTehama was a composite, or strato-type volcano like Mt. Shasta. It was\r\ndestroyed by a series of cracks, called faults, which cut Tehama into\r\nhuge blocks. These sunk, causing collapse of the great mountain. Mt.\r\nConard to the southeast, and the ridge between Brokeoff and Lassen Peak,\r\nare also remnants of the Tehama rim, all dipping away from the center of\r\nthe old volcano.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast horizon are the Sierra Nevada, with Childs Meadow\r\ncloser in. To the north is the ragged top of Diamond Peak with a natural\r\nwindow through the rocks on the upper right near the skyline.\r\n\r\n                               (0.6 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n8 DIAMOND POINT, on the southeast flank of Diamond Peak. This rock is\r\nvolcanic agglomerate, a mass of volcanic ejecta which became stuck\r\ntogether by small amounts of still molten lava. Nearby is one of the\r\nvolcanic vents of ancestral Mt. Tehama. The material on top of Diamond\r\nPeak is explosive debris slightly consolidated by the cementing action\r\nof volcanic ash and is called tuff. It has weathered into very rough and\r\nrugged forms.\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent view of Mt. Conard.\r\n\r\nMill Creek Canyon below has been glaciated; Childs Meadow is visible at\r\nthe mouth of the canyon.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n9 LASSEN PEAK SIGN. This is one of the best views of the south side of\r\nLassen Peak. To the left of it is sharp Eagle Peak and rounded Ski Heil.\r\nTo the right, across the canyon at eye level, the red coloring is due to\r\niron oxides, and the yellow-green is due to millions of lichen plants on\r\nthe rocks. Across the roadway at the roadbank is cool drinking and car\r\nradiator water. Watch for autos when crossing the highway!\r\n\r\n                               (0.1 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n10 THE SLOPING LAYERS OF LAVA AND ASH across the canyon to the east were\r\npart of ancestral Mt. Tehama. Just to the right are highly colored rocks\r\nthat were once grey andesite lavas, but they have been chemically\r\naltered by steam and sulphurous acid from below. The white areas are\r\nlargely clay with some non-precious opal. The tans, red, and purple are\r\nstains of iron oxides. Volcanic fumes reach the surface abundantly in\r\nthis area, rising along fault cracks. Deep in the canyon below lies\r\npicturesque little Ink Lake.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n11 THE HUGE BOULDERS on the west (uphill) side of the road are chunks of\r\ncemented volcanic fragments which have rolled down from the top of\r\nDiamond Peak.\r\n\r\nLassen Peak is visible to the north (up canyon) from this vicinity,\r\npicturesquely framed by roadside trees.\r\n\r\n                              (1.4 miles)\r\n\r\n\r\n12 Rugged DIAMOND PEAK below, nearly encircled by Lassen Park Road, was\r\nnamed for the occurrence of occasional small, double-ended quartz\r\ncrystals and diamond-shaped calcite crystals. These were deposited by\r\nhot volcanic waters that seeped through its already hardened lavas after\r\nvolcanic eruptions had ceased. The mountain is the tough lava feeder, or\r\ncore, of prehistoric Mount Tehama. Diamond Peak has resisted the sinking\r\nand weathering which reduced its surroundings.\r\n\r\n                               (0.7 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n13 HEAD OF LITTLE HOT SPRINGS VALLEY. The “U”-shape cross section of the\r\ncanyon indicates glacial widening in contrast to the “V”-shape found in\r\nnon-glaciated stream cut canyons. There is another hot spring area\r\nabove, near the base of Pilot Pinnacle.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  THE SIERRA NEVADA\r\n  BUMPASS MT.\r\n  MT. CONARD\r\n  DIAMOND PEAK\r\n  LITTLE HOT SPRING VALLEY\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n14 EMERALD POINT: A few yards away is the best view of the southwestern\r\nportion of the park. Left to right is Mt. Conard, Little Hot Springs\r\nValley, Diamond Peak, Brokeoff Mtn., Mt. Diller, Pilot Pinnacle, Ski\r\nHeil, Eagle Peak, and Lassen Peak.\r\n\r\nIn his book “The Mountains of California”, John Muir wrote of the lovely\r\nmountain hemlocks. “Some of the finest groves I have yet found are on\r\nthe south slopes of Lassen’s Butte.”\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n15 EMERALD LAKE, of glacial origin, was named for its beautiful green\r\ncolor. Fishing is not allowed in this lake, and since it is planted with\r\nfish, large Rainbow Trout can be seen close to shore. Please do not\r\nspoil the beauty of this spot by littering the lake or the shore with\r\ntin cans and other refuse.\r\n\r\nThis point is just over 8,000 feet elevation, in the Hudsonian Life\r\nZone. Here the mountain hemlock trees, with their graceful nodding tops,\r\nand the noisy grey, black, and white jay known as the Clark’s\r\nnutcracker, are most conspicuous and typical forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe smooth slopes on Ski Heil Peak behind Emerald Lake are unexcelled\r\nfor skiing.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CLARKS NUTCRACKER (grey with black and white)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MT. HEMLOCK (immature purple cones)]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 GLACIAL ERRATIC. This great isolated lava boulder, perched on the\r\noutside edge of the road just south of the Bumpass Hell parking area,\r\nwas carried by a glacier from the southeast base of Lassen Peak and\r\ndeposited here when the ice river melted. The rock on which it lies has\r\na scratched, grooved, and highly polished surface. This is the work of\r\nrocks frozen into the base of the thick glacier, which moved over this\r\narea and into the valley below during the Ice Age. There are few places\r\nwhere such evidence of volcanic heat and glacial ice is found. Please\r\npark at No. 17 if you wish to walk to the Glacial Erratic.\r\n\r\n                               (0.1 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 BUMPASS HELL PARKING AREA. The Bumpass Hell self-guiding nature\r\ntrail, with explanatory leaflets provided enroute, is a 1.1 mile walk to\r\nthe edge of the hot spring basin. This is Lassen’s most spectacular and\r\ndiversified hydrothermal area. The walk through it involves another\r\nmile. In midsummer wildflowers are excellent along the trail: bog kalmia\r\nand Brewer mountainheath (low pink flowering shrubs), coast erysimum\r\n(orange), Newberry penstemon (red), and silverleaf lupine are the most\r\nconspicuous. Pinemat manzanita (white), rabbitbrush (yellow), and\r\nchinquapin (cream-colored) are dwarf shrubs which are also common.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BOG KALMIA (pink)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COAST ERYSIMUM (orange)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BREWER MOUNTAINHEATH (deep rose)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SATIN LUPINE (blue)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEWBERRY PENSTEMON (dark red)]\r\n\r\nYou can hike through Bumpass Hell and continue via Cold Boiling Lake to\r\nKings Creek Campground. It is an easy walk of 4 miles, most of which is\r\ndownhill.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n18 LAKE HELEN is a deep, blue, glacial lake at 8,164 feet elevation. It\r\nis frozen over for 7 or 8 months a year, and is very cold even in summer\r\nbeing 39 degrees at depth. Lake Helen is exceptional among Lassen’s\r\nlakes in that fish plantings here have been unsuccessful ... perhaps\r\nbecause of a lack of native food.\r\n\r\nThis body of water was named by Major Pierson B. Reading for Mrs. Helen\r\nTanner Brodt who ascended Lassen Peak with him in 1864, the first woman\r\nknown to have made the climb.\r\n\r\nLassen Peak is across the lake to the northwest. The cliffs represent\r\nportions of the original plug of stiff, pasty dacite lava which was\r\nforced up rapidly as a unit through the crust of the earth. Along the\r\nright shoulder of Lassen the trail zig-zags up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the road away from the lake is a large andesite lava\r\noutcrop of vertical plates, or slabs. Known as jointing, this has been\r\ncaused by strains set up in the cooling lava mass after it hardened.\r\nThis helps to wear away mountains because water seeps into these cracks\r\nand wedges them apart when it freezes and expands.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n19 LAKE HELEN PICNIC AREA. In 1933 a bronze plaque was placed here by\r\nEthel Brodt Wilson and her children through the sponsorship of the\r\nShasta Historical Society. It reads: “Lake Helen, elevation 8,164 feet.\r\nNamed for Helen Tanner Brodt by Major Pierson B. Reading in honor of her\r\nbeing the first white woman to see the lake and to make the ascent of\r\nLassen Peak August 28, 1864....”\r\n\r\nJust south is the snow-measuring course, identified by yellow and red\r\nmarkers in the hemlock trees and a tall iron pipe.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n20 The Park Service WINTER CONTROL CABIN is a hundred yards east\r\n(uphill) of the road. It is used by Park Rangers on ski patrols and on\r\nthe monthly winter snow-measuring trips. The latter are conducted in\r\ncooperation with the State of California Snow Survey. The depth of snow\r\npack and the amount of water it contains determines the schedule of\r\ncommercial water-use activities in the valley for the following summer.\r\nSnow packs of 20 feet representing a snowfall of over 50 feet, are\r\ncommon in this area.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n21 Scenic view of LAKE HELEN and the western half of the REMNANTS OF\r\nCOLLAPSED MT. TEHAMA. This ancestral mountain, a composite or\r\nstrato-type volcano, was destroyed during the Ice Age in much the same\r\nmanner as Mt. Mazama, which collapsed to form 2,000 foot deep Crater\r\nLake. Brokeoff Mt., Mt. Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle to the south and west\r\nare remnants of Mt. Tehama.\r\n\r\nIn the roadcut to the east of rounded markings are “inclusions” of an\r\nearly stage of hardening of the crust of this dacite lava which was\r\nlater shattered, and engulfed, and partly remelted when the molten rock\r\nfrom below forced its way upward.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “Vulcan’s Face” appeared in a 1914 eruption cloud\r\n    over Lassen Peak.\r\n                                 —photo by a U.

DILLER\r\n  PILOT PINNACLE\r\n  SKI HEIL PEAK\r\n  EAGLE PEAK\r\n  LAKE HELEN\r\n\r\n\r\n22 LASSEN PEAK TRAIL SIGN. On the southeast side of the road is the Peak\r\nParking Area, and on the northwest side starts the trail up Lassen Peak.\r\nThe Peak Trail is a well-graded climb of about 2,000 feet: from 8,500\r\nfeet to 10,457 feet in 2½ miles of hiking. It takes most persons about 4\r\nhours for the round trip, though some take an hour more, and a few an\r\nhour less. For a pleasant hike:\r\n\r\n  1. Wear low heeled, sturdy shoes.\r\n  2. Hike at a moderate pace, taking short, frequent rests and enjoy the\r\n          ever-changing view.\r\n  3. Take a lunch along.\r\n  4. You can eat snow for water, but do so slowly, otherwise it may make\r\n          you ill.\r\n  5. Dark glasses, sunburn lotion, and a hat are advisable.\r\n  6. Do not start later than 2 hours before sunset, or when storms or\r\n          fog threaten.\r\n  7. DO NOT TAKE SHORT-CUTS ACROSS THE TRAIL. It is against Park\r\n          Regulations and is inadvisable because:\r\n    a. It is dangerous: sprained or broken ankles and arms may result.\r\n    b. Unavoidable dislodging of rocks is dangerous to hikers below.\r\n    c. It costs money to rebuild the trail which short-cutting ruins.\r\n\r\nOn the rise to the left of the trail, the parallel markings in the rock\r\nis known as flow banding and takes place when the lava is still moving\r\nbut cooling rapidly. Directly above this banding, on top of the rock\r\nformation, is glacial polish, which indicates that the lava cooled long\r\nbefore the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nIn climbing the Peak, the trail leaves the Hudsonian Life Zone with\r\nmountain hemlocks and white-bark pine, and at timber line it enters the\r\nArctic-Alpine Life Zone.\r\n\r\nFrom near the register box atop Lassen Peak, Mt. Shasta is to the\r\nnorthwest, 75 miles away, looming up 14,161 feet. To the north, are\r\nChaos Crags, the Devastated Area, Prospect Peak, Cinder Cone, and Butte\r\nLake. Mt. Harkness, Warner Valley, and the mountains of Nevada are to\r\nthe east, with Dyer Peak and Lake Almanor in the distance and Kings\r\nCreek Meadow nearby. To the southeast are the High Sierra including\r\nPyramid Peak in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe.\r\n\r\nTo the west is the rough black dacite lava of 1915 which filled and\r\nobliterated Lassen’s 1914 Crater. This lava also spilled through the\r\nnortheast notch, causing the Great Mudflow of May 19, 1915. Just beyond\r\nthe 1915 lava is the 1915-1916 crater formed by the great explosive\r\neruption of May 22, 1915. It now contains a tiny lake, sapphire blue\r\nwhen not frozen over. The notch on Lassen’s western skyline, just\r\nbeyond, is the 1917 crater. There are active steam vents in the west and\r\nnorth portions of this basin, but the steam does not always condense\r\nwell enough to be seen easily. There are yellow deposits of sulphur on\r\nthe north wall of 1915-1916 crater.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the crater basin, the 1915-1916 and the 1917 craters\r\ncan be seen, and also the Brokeoff-Lassen Ridge to the south, glaciated\r\nBlue Lake Canyon to the southwest, Loomis Peak and the Sacramento Valley\r\nto the west, with the Coast Range Mountains beyond. The highest Coast\r\nRanges to the northwest are the Trinity Alps. Nearby is Manzanita Lake\r\narea with Chaos Jumbles and Chaos Crags to the right (north).\r\n\r\nLassen Peak was named after Peter Lassen, a pioneer of Danish birth who\r\nis reported to have used the mountain as a landmark. Lassen blazed a\r\nround-about emigrant trail from Black Rock (Nevada), east and south of\r\nthe present park area, to his Deer Creek Rancho “Bosquejo” in the\r\nSacramento Valley.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n23 SUMMIT SIGN, HIGHEST POINT on the road: 8,512 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nFor about a mile either way along the road in spring and early summer\r\ncross country skiing is normally good. Snow generally closes the road\r\nfor the winter in November and plows cut through the winter pack\r\nanywhere from the end of May to early July.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n24 In addition to the mountain hemlocks, here also are the gnarled,\r\nmultiple-trunked WHITE BARK PINES. This is one of the few places in\r\nCalifornia where this fascinating and photogenic tree can be reached by\r\nroad. The snow banks seen on the rocky slopes across the ravine\r\nfrequently last through the whole summer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WHITE BARK PINE (cones 1½ inch)]\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n25 LAKE ALMANOR AND MT. HARKNESS VIEW SIGN. Warner Valley has been\r\nmodified by a glacier 1,000 feet thick. Lake Almanor and Mountain Meadow\r\nReservoir, both outside the park, are artificial lakes, part of the\r\nCaribou Power System of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Peter\r\nLassen’s emigrant trail from Black Rock, Nevada, ran from north to south\r\nthrough the Lake Almanor basin (Big Meadow) before turning west again.\r\n\r\nHighway No. 36 runs between the Cascade Range on the north and the\r\nSierra Nevada on the south.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  NEVADA\r\n  MT.

From here Prospect Peak is visible. Like\r\nMt. Harkness, it is a small but good example of shield volcano. On top\r\nof it is a small cinder cone which destroys the low shield-shape\r\ncross-section (indicated by the dotted line) characteristic of that type\r\nof volcano. At the right base of Prospect Peak is Hat Mountain, and\r\nbehind it, at its right base, remarkable Cinder Cone in the northeast\r\ncorner of the park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  HAT MT.\r\n  CINDER CONE\r\n  PROSPECT PEAK\r\n\r\n                               (1.0 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n29 A fine view of UPPER KINGS CREEK MEADOW. This may well have been a\r\nlake once, filled in by glacial and stream-borne materials. The level\r\nmeadow floor caused Kings Creek to move slowly and to wander about\r\n“aimlessly” in a pattern called a “meander” by geologists. Where it\r\nleaves the flat meadow the stream takes on direction and speed, thus\r\nresuming a relatively straight, swift course. As the meadow builds up\r\nhigher, becoming drier, the encroaching forest will eventually engulf\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                              (1.3 miles)\r\n\r\n\r\n30 KINGS CREEK CAMPGROUND and Picnic Area. This is the Canadian Life\r\nZone, although a few “Hudsonian” mountain hemlocks are in the cooler\r\nportions. The 7,400 foot elevation makes this a most delightful,\r\nprimitive type of campsite during the warm summer months.\r\n\r\nThe trail goes south from the campground to Cold Boiling Lake (0.8 mile)\r\nand to Crumbaugh Lake (1.5 miles).\r\n\r\nKings Creek, originating from the springs in these meadows, is a part of\r\nthe Feather River system, draining all of the area between Lassen and\r\nthe Truckee River Divide, the largest single tributary drainage area in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n                               (0.5 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n31 READING PEAK rises over 1,300 feet to an 8,701-foot elevation. Like\r\nLassen Peak, across the meadow to the left, this is a plug volcano. It\r\nhonors Major Pierson B. Reading (pronounced Redding), Northern\r\nCalifornia pioneer. He was General Fremont’s paymaster, and was involved\r\nin the Bear Flag revolt. Reading also discovered gold on Clear Creek in\r\nMarch 1848, and was the first permanent settler of Shasta County. In\r\n1864 he led the third recorded ascent up Lassen Peak. The same year he\r\nfiled a mining claim jointly with K. V. Bumpass on the Bumpass Hell\r\narea.\r\n\r\nDeer are generally seen here in the meadow, especially near sunset\r\nduring late summer and early fall.\r\n\r\n                               (0.6 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n32 KINGS CREEK. On the west side of the road is a small picnic area. On\r\nthe downstream side of the road (left of the creek) is a trail to Warner\r\nValley. Kings Creek Falls is 1.3 miles, and Drakesbad is 4.0 miles. You\r\ncan hike uphill to the base of Lassen Peak.\r\n\r\nIn both Lower and Upper Kings Creek Meadow, fawnlilys, red heather, corn\r\nlily, and white gentian make a fine floral succession from early spring\r\nto autumn. Lupine and pussy paws are also common in the drier locations.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FAWNLILY (yellow and pinkish)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FALSEHELLEBORE (whitish)]\r\n\r\n\r\n33 An EMERGENCY TELEPHONE is just below the park road for reporting\r\naccidents and fires.\r\n\r\n                               (1.0 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n34 LAKE ALMANOR, WARNER VALLEY, and what might be called the friendly\r\nwilderness of the eastern portion of the park. Trails reach this country\r\nfrom Summit Lake and from dead-end secondary roads at Butte Lake,\r\nHorseshoe Lake, and Warner Valley. On Mt. Harkness is a National Park\r\nService fire lookout station. Help keep the forests green by being very\r\ncareful with matches, cigarettes, and the like.\r\n\r\n                               (0.8 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n35 In this vicinity once stood a fine stand of RED FIR. On October 11,\r\n1962, winds of gale force, sweeping up through the valleys from the\r\nsoutheast, blew down and broke off many large trees. This is typical of\r\nthe story of violence and peace of the Lassen area. In a few years the\r\nyoung growth will hide most of the devastation.\r\n\r\nThe short, blue-green, single needles of the red fir grow in a\r\nbrush-like manner. Very symmetrical, the trees are called “Silver Tips”\r\nin the commercial Christmas tree market.\r\n\r\nThe trunks curve at their base due to the heavy snowfall which bends the\r\nsaplings downhill, flat to the ground. In the spring the young trees\r\ncurve up, but the bend remains, and persists throughout the life of the\r\ntree. Curved trunks can also be found in other species of trees, such as\r\nmountain hemlock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CURVED TREE TRUNK]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RED FIR]\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: LASSEN VOLCANIC NATIONAL PARK\r\n                          High-resolution Map]\r\n\r\n                              (1.4 miles)\r\n\r\n\r\n36 SUMMIT LAKE lies on the east side of the road with entrance roads to\r\nthe North and South Campgrounds, 0.1 mile apart. The lake is so named\r\nbecause it lies at the very summit of a divide between the Feather River\r\ndrainage to the south and the Pit River drainage to the north.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the lake is 6,700 feet. It is good for swimming, and\r\nits shores offer fine spots for picnicking or camping. Fishing is\r\ngenerally only fair.\r\n\r\nThis area is dominated by red firs, with lodgepole pine and western\r\nwhite pines. Also characteristic is the pinemat manzanita which forms a\r\ncarpet on the forest floor, bearing numerous small white blossoms.\r\nCream-colored marshmarigolds, and later white false hellebore, are the\r\nmost showy of numerous flowers to be seen in moist areas about the lake.\r\n\r\nHat Mountain is the nearby symmetrical, flat-topped cinder cone, rising\r\n1,195 feet above the level of Summit Lake, to the northeast of it.\r\n\r\nA trail circles the lake and on the far side of it, heads east to Echo\r\nLake, Twin Lakes, Cinder Cone, and Butte Lake; or to Bear and Cluster\r\nLakes; or to Kings Creek Falls, Warner Valley, and Drakesbad.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MARSHMARIGOLD (cream-colored)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LODGEPOLE PINE (cone 1¼ inches)]\r\n\r\n\r\n37 SUMMIT LAKE RANGER STATION.

The side road on the east\r\nleads to the public horse corral. Reservations for riding and pack\r\nhorses may be made during the summer season here or at the Manzanita\r\nLake Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe trail on the west goes to Cliff Lake (2.3 miles), Shadow Lake (3.2\r\nmiles), Terrace Lake (3.5 miles) and on to the base of Lassen Peak.\r\n\r\n                              (1.2 miles)\r\n\r\n\r\n39 DERSCH MEADOWS is a two mile long series of meadows extending\r\nnorthwest from Summit Lake along the park road. It is drained by the\r\nEast Fork of Hat Creek and Dersch Creek. A large variety of fine spring\r\nand summer wildflowers including alpine shooting stars, columbia\r\nmonkshood and rare white orchids, milkwhite habenaria, can be found\r\nclose to the road. Deer are abundant here during the summer and fall\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COLUMBIA MONKSHOOD (blue, rarely white)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MILKWHITE HABENARIA (white)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALPINE SHOOTING STAR (strong pink)]\r\n\r\nThis is CANADIAN LIFE ZONE country. In addition to red fir, the 2-needle\r\nlodgepole pine, and western white pine are abundant. The shrub-like\r\ntrees in the meadows are the moisture-loving willows. The rust-brown\r\nbranches on the red fir have been caused by a small mistletoe which,\r\nlike most mistletoes, cripples but rarely kills the trees.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n40 A large ANT HILL at the base of a small lodgepole pine about 15 feet\r\nfrom the road on the uphill side is about a 3-foot high nest built of\r\ntwigs and dry pine needles by red ants about ¼ inch long. These ants\r\nhave a very well developed social system comparable to that of bees.\r\nPLEASE DO NOT POKE OR OTHERWISE DISTURB THE ANTHILL.\r\n\r\n                               (0.7 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n41 On the north (outside) edge of the park road is a truck trail which\r\nfollows HAT CREEK north, and then eastward to a locked gate at Badger\r\nFlat, 6 miles distant. From Badger Flat, trails lead to Cinder Cone (5\r\nmiles), Butte Lake (7 miles), Cluster Lakes (2 miles), and many other\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThis is the southeast boundary of the DEVASTATED AREA. The down logs all\r\npoint away from Lassen Peak, which dominates the scene and which wrought\r\nthe devastation. Some trees have been uprooted; others have been snapped\r\noff like match sticks.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n42 HAT LAKE PARKING AREA. Nearby is Hat Lake, elevation 6,450 feet. It\r\nwas formed by the mudflow of May 19, 1915, when it blocked Hat Creek.\r\nAll lakes are very temporary features, and this one is a good example,\r\nas it is rapidly being filled by the building of a delta at the south\r\nend of the lake and by the accumulation of organic debris such as logs,\r\netc. This will become a meadow in the near future. Most meadows have\r\nbeen formed in a similar manner. A cream-colored aquatic buttercup\r\nblooms conspicuously on the lake in the summer and early fall.\r\n\r\nThis is a good place to observe birds. The dark, grey-brown water ouzel,\r\nor dipper, can usually be seen or heard near the outlet where Hat Creek\r\nis crossed by the Park Road.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DIPPER or WATER OUZEL (grey-brown)]\r\n\r\nJust across the road from the parking area, the trail to the south goes\r\nto Paradise Meadow: (1.5 miles). An excellent variety of wildflowers\r\nbloom along the trail in mid-summer. Terrace Lake is 2.9 miles from\r\nhere, and the road is again reached at an elevation of nearly 8,000\r\nfeet, 0.5 miles beyond this.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n43 HAT MOUNTAIN. This volcanic cone has an elevation of 7,695 feet,\r\nrising about 1,000 feet above Summit Lake near its south base.\r\n\r\n                               (0.1 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n44 HEART OF THE DEVASTATED AREA. 10,457-foot Lassen Peak rises about\r\n4,000 feet to the southwest. It is the largest plug volcano known. It\r\nwas formed rapidly, being forced up as a stiff pasty mass of lava.\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 1914, without warning, Lassen Peak started a series of\r\neruptions which lasted through 1917. The hundred eruptions during the\r\nfirst year were steam explosions which threw out ash, cinders and\r\nboulders, thus clearing out a new crater. On May 19, 1915, a black\r\ndacite lava flow welled up into this crater and spilled over to the\r\nsouthwest and northeast. At the southwest the lava descended about 1,000\r\nfeet on the Sacramento Valley side of the mountain, cooled and hardened.\r\nHowever, the lava coming down the northeast slope broke off in large\r\npasty chunks, quickly melting a huge accumulation of snow. The resulting\r\nwater, mixed with the large volume of fine and coarse debris from\r\nearlier eruptions formed a great mudflow which roared down the\r\nmountainside. Divided by Raker Peak, part of this mudflow went down Lost\r\nCreek, which the main road now follows northward. The rest went over the\r\n100 foot rise in the east and down that Creek. It cut a swath through\r\nthe forest which had been continuous across Lassen’s lower and middle\r\nslopes. Fertile meadows were covered by as much as 20 feet of mudflow\r\ndebris. The bark of trees on the edge of the mudflow was pounded and\r\nripped off as high as 18 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  LASSEN PEAK\r\n  1915 LAVA FLOW (NE)\r\n  CRESCENT CRATER\r\n  SURVIVORS HILL\r\n  Area swept by hotblast only\r\n  Area swept by mudflow and hotblast\r\n\r\nThree days later (May 22, 1915) a great explosive eruption blasted out a\r\nnew crater atop Lassen Peak, just west of the one which had been filled\r\nwith, and sealed off, by the new lava. A portion of the explosive force\r\nwas deflected downward. The resulting Hot Blast took the same, but\r\nwider, path the mudflow had taken. Trees left standing along the mudflow\r\nmargins were uprooted or broken off by the blast and thrown down, all\r\npointing away from Lassen Peak for a distance of 3 miles from the summit\r\ncrater. Of the logs and snags which constitute an important part of this\r\nevidence, many have already rotted and weathered away since 1915. Some\r\nstill show the abrasion and impact marks of mudflow and hotblast\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\nThe young trees growing in the Devastated Area have not been planted by\r\nman, but are natural reforestation. In National Parks nature takes its\r\ncourse. Man’s meddling, even though well intentioned, often upsets the\r\nbalance of nature, with resultant undesirable and unforeseen effects.\r\n\r\nIn summertime christine lupine (cream-colored) is abundant here. In the\r\nfall, rabbitbrush (yellow) is conspicuous.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RABBITBRUSH (yellow)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHRISTINE LUPINE (pale yellow)]\r\n\r\nIn late summer and fall, deer are numerous on the lower slopes of Lassen\r\nPeak. Some of the deer seen here are mule deer and its more common\r\nsub-species called the black-tailed deer, both recognized by their\r\ntails. The sub-species has a tail entirely black, and the mule deer has\r\nonly the lower tip black with the remainder the color of its coat.\r\n\r\n                               (0.7 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MULE DEER MIGRATE TO THE EAST]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BLACK TAILED DEER MIGRATE TO THE WEST]\r\n\r\n\r\n45 RAKER PEAK to the north is a 1,200-foot cone of andesite lava through\r\nwhich a stiff dome of dacite later welled up, the latter forming the\r\ncliffs. Logs felled by Lassen’s hot blast of May 22, 1915, are also\r\nvisible on its lower slope. The mountain was named Raker Peak in 1933 to\r\nperpetuate the memory of John E. Raker, Representative from California\r\nand author of the successful bill making Lassen a National Park in 1916.\r\n\r\nAcross the road to the west, on the left base of the slope, is a small\r\npatch of mature trees. The mound, called “SURVIVORS HILL,” protected\r\nthese trees from both the mudflow and the great Hot Blast. Survivors\r\nHill also protected a patch of forest on Raker Peak where a patch of old\r\ntrees still stands unscathed, surrounded by down timber.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n46 OLD BOUNDARY SPRING lies in the grove of white-trunked quaking aspen\r\ntrees just southwest and below the level of the Road. The spring\r\nprovides excellent drinking water. Through this site once passed the\r\noriginal park boundary, hence the name.\r\n\r\nQuaking aspens are sun-tolerant trees, members of the poplar family. In\r\nautumn, their leaves turn a golden-yellow, sometimes tinged with red. It\r\nis a short-lived tree and is often a pioneer in areas denuded by fire or\r\nother means. It provides shelter and water-retention, assisting in the\r\nestablishment of young coniferous trees which eventually crowd out the\r\naspens.\r\n\r\n                               (0.5 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n47 An EMERGENCY TELEPHONE is on the east side of the Park Road.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n48 HOT ROCK is one of the many large boulders carried from the top of\r\nLassen Peak. In the mudflow of May 19, 1915, these boulders were known\r\nto the local people as “hot rocks” because they retained their heat for\r\nseveral days. These which were buried in the mudflow material formed\r\nenough steam to cause funnel-shaped “eruption pits” in the mud overlying\r\nthem. These pits can still be seen by careful searching in the upper\r\nportion of the Devastated Area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Lassen Park Road is closed in winter beyond the\r\n    skiing area at No. 3 in the Road Guide.\r\n                                               —NPS photo by R.

This stream has cut a trench not only through\r\nLassen’s recent mudflow, but through earlier ones, some of which were\r\nseparated by rather long periods of time.

Camping space in the other\r\ncampgrounds is available on a first come first served basis.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n56 A magnificent PONDEROSA PINE.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n57 This stretch of forest, especially on the east side of the road, may\r\nbe called a “MICRO-CLIMATE.” The southwest exposure, in a sheltered\r\ndepression, produces a warmer climate which supports white fir, incense\r\ncedar, ponderosa pine, sugar pine, shrubs and annuals characteristic of\r\nlower elevations. The green carpet covering the low rocks and parts of\r\nthe forest floor is called squawcarpet ceanothus.\r\n\r\n                               (0.3 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SUGAR PINE (cone 12 inches)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INCENSE CEDAR (cone 1 inch)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PONDEROSA PINE (cone 3 inches)]\r\n\r\n\r\n58 On the eastern extension of the sharp curve is a loose ROCKY TALUS\r\nSLOPE composed of fine-grained, dark grey boulders known as basalt.\r\nOften basaltic lavas are very porous because they are typically gas-rich\r\nwhen molten, and many bubble holes result as the escaping gases are\r\ntrapped during cooling. This lava is relatively low in silica and high\r\nin iron, hence it is dark in color and heavy in weight.\r\n\r\n                               (0.6 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n59 PROSPECT PEAKS are Hawaiian or shield volcanos made of countless thin\r\nbasaltic lava flows from a central vent, producing shield-shaped\r\noutlines. The sharp peaks on top of these two mountains are small cinder\r\ncones. Badger Mountain is a plug volcano like Chaos Crags or Lassen\r\nPeak. West Peak is outside the park and on it is a Forest Service fire\r\nlook-out station. To the north and northeast are typical virgin forests\r\nmantling a sea of minor volcanic peaks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  LATOUR BUTTE\r\n  MAGEE PEAK\r\n  SUGAR LOAF PEAK\r\n  HAT CREEK RIM\r\n  HAT CREEK FAULT\r\n  WEST PROSPECT PEAK\r\n  PROSPECT PEAK\r\n  BADGER MT.\r\n\r\nThe HAT CREEK FAULT SCARP, outside the park, is a great crack in the\r\nearth where an enormous block to the east, known as the Hat Creek Rim,\r\nrose. The scarp, or bluff, runs about 25 miles north. This is the\r\nbeginning of the so-called basin range structure of Nevada which is\r\nlargely composed of such variously tilted fault blocks.\r\n\r\n                               (0.6 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n60 NOBLES PASS, elevation about 6,000 feet, was discovered by William H.\r\nNobles. In 1852 he offered to reveal the route to business men of Shasta\r\nCity, then the leading settlement of Northern California, for $2,000.\r\nThe new route, the most popular into this region, started at Black Rock,\r\nNevada, and entered the northeast corner of the park at Butte Lake. This\r\nNobles, or Old Emigrant, Trail is still visible to the northeast through\r\nthe chaparral. From this point, it went west along the south base of\r\nTable Mountain and left the park near the highway “Y” beyond Manzanita\r\nLake. Numerous authentic pioneer relics have been found along the route.\r\n\r\nThe chaparral brush formation here is composed of greenleaf manzanita,\r\nsnowbrush, ceanothus, and bitter cherry. Establishment of the chaparral\r\nis often the first step in the natural reforestation of an area swept by\r\nforest fires.\r\n\r\n                               (0.4 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n61 This is one of the largest WHITE FIR trees in the United States. It\r\nis 168 feet high and has a circumference of 20 feet, 7 inches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WHITE FIR]\r\n\r\nThis vicinity is known as SUNFLOWER FLAT due to the abundance of the\r\nflower-like plant called wooly wyethia which blossoms in mid-summer.\r\nOther flowers to be seen are: skyrocket gilia, California stickweed,\r\nNuttall larkspur, and Pacific monardella. A few brilliant red snowplants\r\nare often to be found here up into mid-summer. Remember, no flower\r\npicking is allowed in our National Parks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKYROCKET GILIA (red)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CALIFORNIA STICKSEED (white)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NUTTALL LARKSPUR (blue)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PACIFIC MONARDELLA (white to lavender)]\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n62 The sudden change in topography indicates the east edge of CHAOS\r\nJUMBLES ... the huge landslide from nearby Chaos Crags.\r\n\r\nThis upper edge of the hummocky rock debris is thin, and lies on a\r\nrelatively flat undersurface. As a result, the forest trees grow\r\nnormally here, in contrast to the dwarf forest to be found on the main\r\nmass of thick, sloping, and very porous Jumbles.\r\n\r\nThe pale yellow-green, moss-like material on the tree trunks is called\r\nstaghorn lichen. It is not a moss, but is a union of two plants growing\r\ntogether; a fungus, giving it form and body, and an alga, growing inside\r\nand manufacturing food for both from the air and sunshine. Lichens do\r\nnot in any way harm the trees, and grow as well on dead material.\r\n\r\n                               (0.6 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n63 The pink mountain mass to the south is CHAOS CRAGS. It is composed of\r\nthree plug volcanos of a lava known as dacite. This material was rapidly\r\npushed up in a molten state, much as one would squeeze paste from a\r\ntube. As the lava plugs cooled and hardened, steam explosions took place\r\nfrom the base of the cliff, undermining it and causing at least three\r\ntremendous avalanches estimated as occurring about 1700 years ago, 700\r\nyears ago and the most recent in about the year 1690. Due to the small\r\namount of soil and porous rock, many of the stunted trees in this Dwarf\r\nForest are over 200 years old.\r\n\r\n                               (1.1 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n\r\n64 VISITOR CENTER, LODGE and CAMPGROUND, elevation 5,950 feet, is the\r\ncenter of visitor facilities and services.\r\n\r\nThe Visitor Center is open daily. Free naturalist-conducted hikes,\r\ncaravans, and nature walks originate here. Informal campfire programs\r\nare presented nightly in the Manzanita Lake Campground Amphitheater from\r\nJune through mid-September.\r\n\r\nThe LILY POND SELF-GUIDING NATURE TRAIL, an easy 1-mile loop route,\r\nstarts just across the road from the Visitor Center. It is unique in\r\nhaving ten species of cone-bearing trees and three species of\r\nbroad-leaved trees along its short and nearly level route.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GOLDEN-MANTLED GROUND SQUIRREL · CHIPMUNK]\r\n\r\nAbundant wildlife, including deer and a large variety of birds, is found\r\nin the Manzanita-Reflection Lakes area. The most common rodents are the\r\ngolden-mantled ground squirrel and the chipmunk.\r\n\r\nThe Loomis Museum, with a tract of 40 acres, was given to the Federal\r\nGovernment in 1927 by Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Loomis in memory of their\r\ndaughter, Mae. On this land are now located the public lodge and dining\r\nroom, curio store, service station, grocery store and postoffice.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: National Park Service logo]\r\n\r\nThe National Park Service emblem pictured here was adopted in 1953. Many\r\nvisitors confuse the Park Service (Department of the Interior) with the\r\nForest Service (Department of Agriculture). Briefly, the National Park\r\nService preserves the National Parks and Monuments in an unchanged\r\nstate, while the U. S. Forest Service operates National Forests on a\r\nsustaining yield basis.\r\n\r\n                               (0.1 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JEFFREY PINE (cone about 5 inches)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SNOWPLANT (red)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COW LILY (yellow)]\r\n\r\n\r\n65 REFLECTION LAKE, elevation 5,880 feet. A few hundred feet ahead is\r\nthe road to the Reflection Lake Picnic Ground. There tables, fireplaces,\r\nand rest rooms are available for free visitor use.\r\n\r\nReflection Lake gets its name from the fine reflections of Lassen Peak\r\nand Chaos Crags to be seen in it from near the picnic ground. It is an\r\nexcellent place for photography, especially in the afternoon or early\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOn summer evenings nighthawks can be seen cruising over the lake,\r\nemitting their unique harsh cries and their startling “whoomm” sound in\r\nflight. Bats on the wing also are seen in the evenings feeding on\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BROWN BAT]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NIGHTHAWK]\r\n\r\n\r\n66 On the down hill side of the road is MANZANITA LAKE, elevation 5,845\r\nfeet. This lake is young, formed by the Chaos Jumbles landslide. The\r\nwater level was raised a few feet in 1912 by the Northern California\r\nPower Company, for electric power development purposes by the\r\nconstruction of a small earth dam at the lake’s southwest extremity.\r\n\r\nLike most of Lassen’s lakes, it is well stocked with trout. In the fall\r\nlarge numbers of waterfowl, including Canada geese, stop here en route\r\nto their wintering grounds.\r\n\r\nThe lake derived its name from the abundance of greenleaf manzanita on\r\nits shores. This shrub can be seen across the lake to the south.\r\n\r\n                               (0.2 mile)\r\n\r\n\r\n67 MANZANITA LAKE ENTRANCE STATION. Vehicle entry permits and\r\ninformation may be procured daily during the summer season.\r\n\r\nLovely views of Lassen Peak are to be had along the Lake Trail just a\r\nfew feet from the Entrance Station at this end of the lake. It is a fine\r\narea for taking photographs, especially in the afternoon and early\r\nevening. Lassen Peak towers 4,625 feet above Manzanita Lake to an\r\nelevation of 10,457 feet. The summit notch in the 1917 crater, and the\r\nblack tongue extending down toward the right is the youngest rock in\r\ncontiguous United States, pouring out as molten, redhot dacite lava on\r\nthe night of May 19, 1915.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Landscape]\r\n\r\n  1915 DACITE (SW LAVA FLOW)\r\n  1917 CRATER STEAM\r\n  EAGLE PEAK\r\n  SKI HEIL PEAK\r\n  CHAOS CRAGS\r\n  LASSEN PEAK\r\n  LOOMIS PEAK\r\n  MANZANITA LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 AUTO TRIPS TO OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
