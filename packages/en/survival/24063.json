For the past few years I have been receiving\r\ngrasses for identification, almost every week, from the officers of the\r\nAgricultural and Forest Departments and others interested in grasses.\r\nThe requirements of these men and the absence of a suitable book induced\r\nme to write this book.\r\n\r\nI have included in this book about one hundred grasses of wide\r\ndistribution in the plains of South India. Many of them occur also in\r\nother parts of India. The rarer grasses of the plains and those growing\r\non the hills are omitted, with a view to deal with them separately.\r\n\r\nThe value of grasses can be realized from the fact that man can supply\r\nall his needs from them alone, and their importance in agriculture is\r\nvery great, as the welfare of the cattle is dependent upon grasses.\r\nFarmers, as a rule, take no interest in them, although profitable\r\nagriculture is impossible without grasses. Very few of them can give the\r\nnames of at least half a dozen grasses growing on their land. They\r\nneglect grasses, because they are common and are found everywhere. They\r\ncannot discriminate between them. To a farmer \"grass is grass\" and that\r\nis all he cares to trouble himself about. About grasses Robinson writes\r\n\"Grass is King. It rules and governs the world. It is the very\r\nfoundation of all commerce: without it the earth would be a barren\r\nwaste, and cotton, gold, and commerce all dead.\"\r\n\r\nIn the early days when the population was very much limited and when\r\nland not brought under cultivation was extensive plenty of green grasses\r\nwas upon it and pastures were numerous. So the farmer paid no attention\r\nto the grasses, and it did not matter much. But now, population has\r\nincreased, unoccupied land has decreased very much and the cattle have\r\nincreased in number. Consequently he has to pay more attention to\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nOn account of the scarcity of fodder, people interested in agriculture\r\nand cattle rearing have very often imported foreign grasses and fodder\r\nplants into this country, but so far no one has succeeded in\r\nestablishing any one of them on any large scale. Usually a great amount\r\nof labour and much money is spent in these attempts. If the same amount\r\nof attention is bestowed on indigenous grasses, better results can be\r\nobtained with less labour and money. There are many indigenous grasses\r\nthat will yield plenty of stuff, if they are given a chance to grow. The\r\npresent deterioration of grasses is mainly due to overgrazing and\r\ntrampling by men and cattle.\r\n\r\nTo prove the beneficial effects which result from preventing overgrazing\r\nand trampling, Mr. G. R. Hilson, Deputy Director of Agriculture (now\r\nCotton Expert), selected some portion of the waste land in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Farm at Hagari and closed it for men and cattle. As\r\na result of this measure, in two years, a number of grasses and other\r\nplants were found growing on the enclosed area very well, and all of\r\nthem seeded well. Of course the unenclosed areas were bare as usual.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this book I received considerable help from\r\nM.R.Ry. C. Tadulinga Mudaliyar Avargal, F.L.S., Assistant Lecturing and\r\nSystematic Botanist, in the description of species and I am indebted to\r\nM.R.Ry. P.S. Jivanna Rao, M.A., Teaching Assistant, for assistance in\r\nproofreading.\r\n\r\nI have to express my deep obligation to Mr. G. A. D. Stuart, I.C.S.,\r\nDirector of Agriculture, for encouragement to undertake this work and to\r\nthe Madras Government for ordering its publication.\r\n\r\nFor the excellence in the get up of the book I am indebted to Mr. F. L.\r\nGilbert, Superintendent, Government Press.\r\n\r\nK.

They occur in every soil, in all kinds of\r\nsituations and under all climatic conditions. In certain places grasses\r\nform a leading feature of the flora. As grasses do not like shade, they\r\nare not usually abundant within the forests either as regards the number\r\nof individuals, or of species. But in open places they do very well and\r\nsometimes whole tracts become grass-lands. Then a very great portion of\r\nthe actual vegetation would consist of grasses.\r\n\r\nOn account of their almost universal distribution and their great\r\neconomic value grasses are of great importance to man. And yet very few\r\npeople appreciate the worth of grasses. Although several families of\r\nplants supply the wants of man, the grass family exceeds all the others\r\nin the amount and the value of its products. The grasses growing in\r\npasture land and the cereals grown all over the world are of more value\r\nto man and his domestic animals than all the other plants taken\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTo the popular mind grasses are only herbaceous plants with narrow\r\nleaves such as the hariali, ginger grass and the kolakattai grass. But\r\nin the grass family or Gramineæ the cereals, sugarcane and bamboos are\r\nalso included.\r\n\r\nGrasses are rather interesting in that they are usually successful in\r\noccupying large tracts of land to the exclusion of other plants. If we\r\ntake into consideration the number of individuals of any species of\r\ngrass, they will be found to out-number those of any species of any\r\nother family. Even as regards the number of species this family ranks\r\nfifth, the first four places being occupied respectively by Compositæ,\r\nLeguminosæ, Orchideæ and Rubiaceæ.\r\n\r\nAs grasses form an exceedingly natural family it is very difficult for\r\nbeginners to readily distinguish them from one another.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and branches of grasses are very much alike and the flowers\r\nare so small that they are liable to be passed by unnoticed. The\r\nrecognition of even our common grasses is quite a task for a botanist.\r\n\r\nTo understand the general structure of grasses and to become familiar\r\nwith them it is necessary to study closely some common grasses. We shall\r\nbegin our study by selecting as a type one of the species of the genus\r\nPanicum.\r\n\r\n_Panicum javanicum_ is an annual herb with stems radiating in all\r\ndirections from a centre. The plant is fixed to the soil by a tuft of\r\nfibrous roots all springing from the bases of the stems. In addition to\r\nthis crown of fibrous roots, there may be roots at the nodes of some of\r\nthe prostrate branches. The stems and branches are short at first, and\r\nleaves arise on them one after the other in rapid succession. After the\r\nappearance of a fair number of leaves the stem elongates gradually and\r\nit finally ends in an inflorescence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Panicum javanicum. (Full plant.)]\r\n\r\nThe stem consists of =nodes= and =internodes=. The internodes are\r\ncylindrical and somewhat flattened on the side towards the axillary bud.\r\nWhen young they are completely covered by the leaves and the older ones\r\nhave only their lower portions covered by the leaf-sheaths. Usually they\r\ncomplete their growth in length very soon, but the lower portion of the\r\ninternode, just above the node and enclosed by the sheath, retains its\r\npower of growth for some time.\r\n\r\nThe leaf consists of the two parts, the =leaf-sheath= and the\r\n=leaf-blade=. At the junction of these two parts there is a very thin\r\nnarrow membrane with fine hairs on its free margin. This is called the\r\n=ligule=. (See fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nThe leaf-sheath is attached at its base to the node and it is slightly\r\nswollen just above the place of insertion. It covers the internode, one\r\nmargin being inside and the other outside. The surface of the sheath is\r\nsparsely covered with long hairs springing from small tubercles. The\r\nouter margin of the sheath bears fine hairs all along its length. (See\r\nfig. 2.)\r\n\r\nThe leaf-blade is broadly lanceolate, with a tip finely drawn out. Its\r\nbase is rounded and the margin wavy, especially so towards the base. On\r\nthe margin towards the base long hairs are seen, and some of these arise\r\nfrom small tubercles. The margin has a hyaline border which is very\r\nminutely serrate. There is a distinct midrib and, on holding the leaf\r\nagainst the light, four or five small veins come in to view. In the\r\nspaces between these veins lie many fine veins. All the veins run\r\nparallel from the base to the apex. At the base of the blade the veins\r\nget into the leaf-sheath and therefore the sheath becomes striated. Just\r\nabove the ligule and at the base of the leaf-blade there is a colourless\r\nnarrow zone. This is called the =collar=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Leaf of Panicum javanicum.\r\n\r\nA. Full leaf; B. a portion of the leaf showing 1. the ligule and 2. the\r\ncollar.]\r\n\r\nAs already stated the inflorescences appear at the free ends of\r\nbranches. Every branch sooner or later terminates in an inflorescence\r\nwhich is a compound raceme. There are usually five or six racemes in the\r\ninflorescence. Each raceme has an axis, called the =rachis=, which bears\r\nunilaterally two rows of bud-like bodies. These bud-like bodies are the\r\nunits of the inflorescence and they are called =spikelets=. (See fig.\r\n3.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--The inflorescence of Panicum javanicum.\r\n\r\n1. Inflorescence; 2 and 3. the front and the back view of a raceme.]\r\n\r\nThe spikelets are softly hairy and are shortly stalked. The pedicels of\r\nspikelets are hairy and sometimes one or two long hairs are also found\r\non them. Each of these spikelets consists of four green membranous\r\nstructures called =glumes=. The first two glumes are unequal, the first\r\nbeing very small. The second and the third glumes are broadly\r\novate-oblong with acute tips. Both are of the same height and texture,\r\nbut the second is 7-nerved and the third 5-nerved. The fourth glume is\r\nmembranous when young, but later on it becomes thick, coriaceous and\r\nrugose at the surface. Just opposite to the fourth glume there is a flat\r\nstructure with two nerves, similar to the glume in texture. This is\r\ncalled the =palea=. The fourth glume and its palea adhere together by\r\ntheir margins. Inside the fourth glume and between it and the palea\r\nthere are three stamens and an ovary with two styles ending in feathery\r\nstigmas. Just in front of the ovary and outside the stamens two very\r\nsmall scale-like bodies are found. These are the =lodicules=. They are\r\nfleshy and well developed in flowers that are about to open. In the\r\nspikelet there is only one full flower. The third glume contains no\r\nflower in it, but occasionally there may be in its axil three stamens.\r\nThe first two glumes are always empty and so they are called empty\r\nglumes. (See fig. 4.) In mature spikelets the grain which is free is\r\nenclosed by the fourth glume and its palea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Parts of the spikelets of Panicum javanicum.\r\n\r\nA.

Some grasses grow erect forming\r\ntufts and others form cushions with the branches creeping along the\r\nground. (See figs. 5 and 6.) We usually find all intermediate stages\r\nfrom the erect to the prostrate habit. Underground stems such as stolons\r\nand rhizomes occur in some grasses. Grasses of one particular species\r\ngenerally retain the same habit but this does not always hold good. For\r\nexample _Tragus racemosus_ grows with all its branches quite prostrate\r\nin a poor, dry, open soil. If, on the other hand, this happens to grow\r\nin rich soils, or amidst other plants or grasses, it assumes an erect,\r\nsomewhat tufted habit. _Andropogon contortus_ and _Andropogon pertusus_\r\nare other grasses with a tendency for variation in habit. Plants that\r\nare usually small often attain large dimensions under favourable\r\nconditions of growth. Ordinarily the grass _Panicum javanicum_ grows\r\nonly to 1 or 2 feet. (See fig. 1.) The same plant in a good rich soil\r\ngrew to about 6 feet in four months. (See fig. 7.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Eleusine ægyptiaca.]\r\n\r\nSome grasses are annual while others are perennial. It is often\r\ndifficult to determine whether a certain grass is annual or perennial.\r\nBut by examining the shoot-system this can be ascertained easily. In an\r\nannual all the stems and branches usually end in inflorescences and they\r\nwill all be of the same year. If, on the other hand, both young leafy\r\nbranches and old branches ending in inflorescences are found mixed, it\r\nmust be a perennial grass. The presence of the remains of old leaves,\r\nunderground stolons and rhizomes is also evidence showing the perennial\r\ncharacter of the plant.\r\n\r\nGrasses are eminently adapted to occupy completely large areas of land.\r\nThey are also capable of very rapid extension over large areas, on\r\naccount of the production of stolons, rhizomes and the formation of\r\nadventitious roots.\r\n\r\n=The root-system.=--The root-system of grasses is very striking in its\r\ncharacter. In most grasses, especially in erect ones, several roots all\r\nof about the same diameter arise in a dense tuft from nearly the same\r\nlevel and from the lower-most nodes of the stems. The roots are all thin\r\nand fibrous in the vast majority of these plants, and they are tough and\r\nwiry only in a few cases such as in the case of the roots of _Pennisetum\r\ncenchroides_, _P. Alopecuros_, _Ischæmum pilosum_ and _Andropogon\r\nSchoenanthus_.\r\n\r\nOn a close examination it will become evident that all the roots of a\r\ngrass plant are adventitious. Inasmuch as the growth of the primary root\r\nis soon overtaken by other roots growing from the stem, all the roots\r\nhappen to be of the same size. Roots arise from the nodes just above the\r\ninsertion of the leaf, and they grow piercing the leaf-sheath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Panicum Crus-galli.]\r\n\r\nGrasses in which stolons and prostrate branches occur have, in addition\r\nto the usual radiating crown of roots at the base, aerial roots growing\r\nout of the upper nodes of the branches and fixing them to the soil. Such\r\nroots become supporting or prop roots and are particularly conspicuous\r\nin several stout tall grasses such as _Andropogon Sorghum_, _Zea Mays_\r\nand _Pennisetum typhoideum_. (See figs. 8 and 9.)\r\n\r\nAll the roots bear branch-roots which originate from the inner portion\r\nof the mother roots in the usual manner. The character and the extent of\r\nthe development of the root-system is to a large extent dependent upon\r\nthe nature of the soil and its moisture content. In light dry soils\r\nroots remain generally stunted and in well drained rich soils they\r\nattain their maximum development. In clayey soils roots penetrate only\r\nto short distances. When the soil is rich and sandy roots go deeper and\r\nextend in all directions. The root-systems of most grasses are\r\nsuperficial and so are best adapted for surface-feeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Panicum javanicum.]\r\n\r\n=The shoot-system.=--The shoot-system varies with the duration of the\r\nlife of the plant. In annual grasses stems are in most cases erect and\r\neven if they are not entirely so they become erect at the time of\r\nflowering. They are attached to the soil by a tuft of fibrous roots\r\narising from the base of the stems. But in perennials in addition to\r\nerect branches, creeping branches, stolons and rhizomes may occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Prop roots of Andropogon Sorghum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Aerial roots of Ischæmum ciliare.]\r\n\r\nThe stem is either cylindrical or compressed and consists of nodes and\r\ninternodes. In most grasses the internodes are usually hollow, the\r\ncavity being lined by the remains of the original pith cells. However,\r\nthere are also grasses in which the stems remain solid throughout. In\r\nmany grasses the basal portions of stems are more leafy and the\r\ninternodes are short, but in the upper portions the internodes become\r\nlonger separating the leaves one from the other.\r\n\r\nIn young shoots the leaves grow much faster than the internodes and\r\nconsequently internodes remain small, and leaves become very\r\nconspicuous. The youngest portions of the shoots are by this means\r\nalways well protected by the surrounding leaf-sheaths. As soon as leaves\r\nhave grown fully, the internodes begin to elongate rapidly separating\r\nthe leaves. At first growth in length takes place throughout its length\r\nin the internode and when it gets older this elongation ceases. But,\r\nhowever, the lower portion of the internode close to the node and which\r\nis enclosed by the leaf-sheath retains its power of growth for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nBranches arise from the axils of leaves and when a considerable number\r\nof the axillary buds, especially from the lower nodes, develop into\r\nbranches the plant becomes tufted in habit. In most grasses branches\r\ngrow upwards through the sheath and emerge at its mouth as aerial\r\nbranches. Such branches are called =intravaginal= branches or stems. But\r\nin some grasses axillary buds, instead of growing straight up through\r\nthe sheath, pierce the leaf-sheath, come out and then they grow out as\r\nbranches. This may be seen in the underground stolons of _Panicum\r\nrepens_ and in the ordinary aerial branches of _Arundo Donax_. Branches\r\nthat pierce through the sheaths are called =extravaginal= branches. (See\r\nfig. 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Extravaginal shoots of 1. Panicum repens and 2.\r\nArundo Donax.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Nodes.\r\n\r\n1. Glabrous node; 2. bearded node; 3. node cut longitudinally.]\r\n\r\nThe nodes are in most cases very conspicuous and they are often found\r\nswollen. However, it must be remembered that the enlargement at the node\r\nis not due to the increase in size of the actual node, but due to growth\r\nin thickness of the base of the leaf-sheath. (See fig. 11-3.) Nodes may\r\nbe pale or coloured, glabrous, hairy or bearded with long hairs. When\r\nthe stem is erect the nodes are short and of uniform size all round.\r\nBut, if the stem is bent down or tipped over by accident, the nodes\r\nbegin to grow longer on the lower side until a curvature sufficient to\r\nbring the stem to the erect position is formed and then it ceases to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nAs already noted some perennial grasses have creeping stems and stolons,\r\nwhile others may have rhizomes. The grass _Cynodon dactylon_ develops\r\nseveral underground stolons which are covered with white scale leaves\r\nand whose terminal buds are hard and sharp so that they may be able to\r\nmake their way through the soil. The rhizomes when continuous and\r\nelongated are usually sympodia formed by the lower portions of the\r\naerial shoots. The aerial shoot comes into the air and its lower portion\r\nis continued by a branch arising from a lower leaf axil beneath the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n=The leaf.=--Leaves are two-ranked and alternate, and very often they\r\nbecome crowded at the lower portions of the shoots so as to form basal\r\ntufts, though they are farther apart in the upper portions of these\r\nshoots. Three distinct kinds of leaves are met with in grasses. First,\r\nwe have the fully formed foliage leaves so characteristic of grasses.\r\nThese are most conspicuous and are formed in large numbers.\r\n\r\nThe other two kinds of leaves are neither so conspicuous nor so numerous\r\nas the foliage leaves. At the base of shoots occur abortive leaves which\r\nare really rudimentary sheaths. These are called =scales=. The third\r\nkind of leaf is a modified structure called the =prophyll= or\r\n=prophyllum=. (See fig. 12.) It is the first leaf occurring in every\r\nbranch on the side next to the main shoot and it is a two-keeled\r\nmembranous structure resembling somewhat the palea found in the\r\nspikelets of grasses. The portion of the prophyll between the keels is\r\nconcave due to the pressure of the main stem, while the sides beyond the\r\nkeels bend forward clasping the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Prophylla.\r\n\r\nA. A branch with its prophyllum; B. prophyllum; C. section of the\r\nprophyllum.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary foliage leaves of grasses consist of the two parts, the\r\nflat expanded upper portion called the =blade= and the lower part called\r\nthe =sheath= that encircles the stem above the node from which it\r\narises. The leaf-sheaths usually fit close to the stem, but they may\r\nalso be loose or even inflated. Though the leaf-sheath surrounds the\r\ninternode like a tube, it is not a closed tube. It is really a flat\r\nstructure rolled firmly round the stem with one edge overlapping the\r\nother. In most cases it is cylindrical and it may be compressed in a few\r\ncases. Occasionally it may have a prominent ridge or keel down its back.\r\nThe sheath may be glabrous or hairy, smooth or striate externally, and\r\nthe outer margin is often ciliate. In a few grasses the sheaths become\r\ncoloured especially below or on the side exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Ligules of 1. Oryza sativa; 2. Panicum\r\njavanicum; 3. Andropogon Schoenanthus; 4. A. contortus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Shapes of leaf-blades.\r\n\r\n1, 7 and 8. Lanceolate; 3 and 6. lanceolate-linear; 2 and 5. linear; and\r\n4. ovate.]\r\n\r\nThe =ligule= is a structure peculiar to grasses and it varies very much.\r\nIn some grasses it is a distinct membrane narrow or broad, with an even,\r\ntruncate or erose margin, or finely ciliate. Very often it is only a\r\nline or fringe of hairs, whilst in some it may be entirely absent as in\r\nthe leaves of _Panicum colonum_. When it is a membrane it may be broad\r\nand oblong, ovate and obtuse, or lanceolate and acute. (See fig. 13.)\r\nThe function of the ligule is probably to facilitate the shedding of\r\nwater which may run down the leaf, and thus lessen the danger of rotting\r\nof the stem which is sure to follow, if the water were to find its way\r\ninto the interior of the sheath. Sometimes, in addition to the ligule,\r\nother appendages may be present in grass leaves as in _Oryza sativa_.\r\nSuch outgrowths are called =auricles= or =auricular outgrowths=. (See\r\nfig. 13.)\r\n\r\nThe leaf-blade is well developed in the foliage leaves and in most cases\r\nit follows directly on the sheath. But in bamboos and some species of\r\nIschæmum there occurs a short petiole or stalk between the leaf-blade\r\nand the sheath. The sheath corresponds morphologically to the leaf base\r\nof a leaf of other flowering plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Margins of leaves.\r\n\r\n1 and 2. Finely serrate; 3. glandular; 4 and 5. very minutely serrate;\r\n6. very minutely serrate and ciliate.]\r\n\r\nIn grasses the leaf-blades usually grow more in length than in any other\r\ndirection and there is no limit to the length they may attain. Some\r\ngrasses have very short leaves, others very long ones. The leaf-blade in\r\nmost grasses is more or less of some elongated form, such as linear,\r\nlinear-lanceolate, lanceolate, etc. (See fig. 14.) In a few grasses the\r\nleaf-blade is ovate, but this is a rare condition. Therefore, in noting\r\nthe general shape of the leaf-blade the relation of the length to the\r\nbreadth, the amount of tapering towards the apex and base and the nature\r\nof the apex should be considered.\r\n\r\nThe veins in the leaf-blade can usually be seen on holding the leaf up\r\nto the light. All the veins run parallel. In most cases the midrib is\r\nprominent and in some cases there may be also a distinct keel. Amongst\r\nthe veins running through the leaf-blade some are large and prominent,\r\nwhile others are small and not conspicuous. On account of this\r\ndisparity, very often, ridges and furrows become prominent on the upper\r\nor lower, or on both the surfaces of the leaf-blades. Generally the two\r\nsurfaces of the leaf-blade are distinct, and they may be glabrous or\r\nhairy. In most grasses the surfaces are rough or scabrid to the touch\r\nowing to the presence of regular rows of exceedingly fine sharp pointed\r\nminute hairs.\r\n\r\nThe apex of the blade is generally sharp and pointed, acute or\r\nacuminate, or sometimes it may be drawn to a very fine point by gradual\r\ntapering. Blunt or obtuse tips are not altogether absent, but it is not\r\na common feature. The leaf-blades in _Panicum colonum_ and in some\r\nspecies of Andropogon are rounded or obtuse at the apex.\r\n\r\nThe margins of the leaf-blade are somewhat hyaline and they may be\r\nperfectly even or cut into serrations of fine teeth in various ways.\r\n(See fig. 15.) In addition to these minute teeth, there may be long or\r\nshort cilia. Sometimes the margins are glandular as in _Eragrostis\r\nWilldenoviana_ and _Eragrostis major_.\r\n\r\nThe base of the leaf may be narrower, broader than, or about the same as\r\nthe breadth of the leaf-sheath. It may be rounded, amplexicaul or\r\nnarrowed. At the base and just above the ligular region there will\r\nalways be a white distinct zone in the lamina of all grasses called the\r\ncollar. This collar varies in length and breadth according to the\r\nspecies of grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Transverse section of leaf-buds.\r\n\r\nA. Conduplicate; 1, 2 and 3. leaf-sheaths; 4 and 5. leaf-blades. B.\r\nConvolute; 1 and 2, leaf-sheaths; 3 and 4. leaf-blades.]\r\n\r\nIn young shoots all the leaf-blades are usually found folded at the\r\nterminal portions. In most cases the leaf-blade is rolled up inwards\r\nfrom one end to the other so that one margin is inside and the other\r\noutside. This folding is termed =convolute=. This is the kind of folding\r\nthat is found in most grasses. However, there are some grasses such as\r\n_Eleusine ægyptiaca_ and _Chloris barbata_, in which the folding is\r\ndifferent. In these grasses the laminas are folded flat on their midribs\r\nso that each half of the blade is folded flat on the other, the inner\r\nsurfaces being in contact. The leaves are said to be =conduplicate= in\r\nthis case. When the leaves are conduplicate the shoots are more or less\r\ncompressed. (See fig. 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLORESCENCE AND FLOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flowers of grasses are reduced to their essential organs, the\r\nstamens and the pistil. The flowers are aggregated together on distinct\r\nshoots constituting the inflorescence of grasses. Sooner or later all\r\nthe branches of a grass-plant terminate in inflorescences which usually\r\nstand far above the foliage leaves. As in other flowering plants, in\r\ngrasses also different forms of inflorescence are met with. But in\r\ngrasses the unit of the inflorescence is the =spikelet= and not the\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nThe forms of inflorescence usually met with are the spike, raceme and\r\npanicle. When the spikelets are sessile or borne directly along an\r\nelongated axis as in _Enteropogon melicoides_ the inflorescence is a\r\n=spike=. If the spikelets borne by the axis are all stalked, however\r\nshort the pedicels may be, it is a =raceme=. It must, however, be\r\nremembered that true spikes are very rare. An inflorescence may appear\r\nto be a spike, but on a close examination it will be seen to consist of\r\nspikelets more or less pedicelled. Such an inflorescence, strictly\r\nspeaking, is a =spiciform raceme=. The branches of the inflorescence in\r\n_Paspalum scrobiculatum_ or _Panicum javanicum_ are racemes and the\r\nwhole inflorescence is a compound raceme. The inflorescence is a\r\n=panicle= when the spikelets are borne on secondary, tertiary or further\r\nsubdivided branches. Panicles differ very much in appearance according\r\nto the relative length and stoutness of the branches. In _Eragrostis\r\ntremula_ the panicle is very diffuse, in _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_ less\r\nso. The panicle in _Sporobolus coromandelianus_ is pyramidal and the\r\nbranches are all verticillate, the lower being longer than the upper.\r\nThe branches of a panicle are usually loose, spreading or drooping in\r\nmost grasses. But in some species of grasses such as _Pennisetum\r\nAlopecuros_ and _Setaria glauca_, the paniculate inflorescences become\r\nso contracted that the pedicels and the short branches are hidden and\r\nthe inflorescence appears to be a spike. Such inflorescences as these\r\nare called =spiciform panicles=. The inflorescences in several species\r\nof Andropogon consist of racemes so much modified as to appear exactly\r\nlike a spike. What looks like a spike in these cases consists of a\r\njointed axis and each joint bears a pair of spikelets, one sessile and\r\nthe other pedicelled.\r\n\r\nThe name =rachis= is given to the axis of the spike, raceme and panicle,\r\nwhether the axis is the main one or of the branch. The rachis of the\r\ninflorescence is usually cylindrical. In some grasses it is zigzag as in\r\n_Pennisetum cenchroides_. It is very much flattened in _Paspalum\r\nscrobiculatum_, but somewhat trigonous in _Digitaria sanguinalis_. In\r\nvery many grasses the rachis is continuous, but in a few cases it\r\nconsists of internodes or joints which disarticulate at maturity. Many\r\nspecies of Andropogon have such jointed rachises. Sometimes the joints\r\nbecome greatly thickened and the surface hollowed out, the spikelets\r\nfitting in the cavities as in Rottboellia and Manisuris.\r\n\r\nIn panicles, especially when they are diffuse, the primary branches may\r\nbe disposed irregularly or in verticils on the main axis. For example in\r\nthe panicle of _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_, the branches are irregularly\r\ndisposed, whereas in _Sporobolus coromandelianus_ the branches are\r\nverticillate. In both these grasses fleshy cushions are developed in the\r\naxils of the branches. These swellings help to spread out the branches\r\nespecially at the time of anthesis. The branches at the top spread out\r\nearlier than those below.\r\n\r\nSometimes at the base of the rachises, main or secondary, glandular\r\nstreaks are seen as in the rachises of _Sporobolus coromandelianus_.\r\nThese glands secrete a viscid juice at the time of anthesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--The Spikelet of Dinebra arabica.\r\n\r\n1 and 2. Empty glumes; 3, 4, 5, and 6. flowering glumes with flowers.]\r\n\r\nThe =spikelet= may be considered as a specialised branch consisting of a\r\nshort axis, the =rachilla= bearing a series of modified bracts, the\r\n=glumes=, the lower pair being empty but the others bearing flowers in\r\ntheir axils. The glumes are two-ranked and imbricating. As a type for\r\nthe spikelet that of an Eragrostis or Dinebra may be chosen. (See fig.\r\n17.) In this spikelet the rachilla bears a number of glumes alternating\r\nand imbricating. The first two glumes at the base of the spikelet do not\r\nbear any flowers and so these two glumes are usually called empty\r\nglumes. This is the case in almost all the species of grasses. The third\r\nand the subsequent glumes are regularly arranged on the slender rachilla\r\nalternately in two rows. In the axils of each of these glumes there is a\r\nflower, except perhaps in the topmost glume. The flower is usually\r\nenclosed by the glume and another structure found opposite the glume and\r\ndiffering very much from the glume. This is the =palea=. It is attached\r\nto the axis of the flower and its back is towards the rachilla.\r\nGenerally there are two nerves in a palea and its margins are enclosed\r\nwithin those of the glume. The palea is homologous with the prophyllum\r\nwhich it very much resembles. The prophyllum is usually found in the\r\nbranches of grasses, but it is not confined to grasses alone. It occurs\r\nin the branches of some species of Commelina.\r\n\r\nThe spikelets vary very much in their structure. The spikelets in\r\ngrasses of several genera consist of only four glumes. As usual the\r\nfirst two glumes are empty and the remaining two are flower-bearing\r\nglumes. Both these glumes may have perfect flowers as in Isachne or the\r\nterminal one may contain a perfect flower, the lower having either a\r\nstaminate flower or only a palea. Very often the spikelets are unisexual\r\nand the male and female spikelets may be on the same plant as in _Coix\r\nLachryma-Jobi_ and _Polytoca barbata_, or they may be on different\r\nplants as in _Spinifex squarrosus_.\r\n\r\nThe glumes of a spikelet are really modified bracts and some\r\ndifferentiate the flowering glumes from the empty ones, by giving them\r\ndifferent names. The first two empty glumes are called glumes by all\r\nagrostologists. Some in Europe call the flowering glume lower palea to\r\ndistinguish it from the real palea which they call the upper palea. Some\r\nAmerican Authors have recently adopted for the flowering glume the term\r\n=lemma= introduced by Piper.\r\n\r\nConsiderable variation is met with in the case of the empty glumes.\r\nGenerally they are unequal, the first being smaller. Very often the\r\nfirst glume becomes very small and it may be altogether absent. In some\r\nspecies of Panicum the first glume is very small, in Digitaria it is\r\nvery minute and in Paspalum and Eriochloa it is entirely suppressed. The\r\nflowering glumes are generally uniform when there are many. In the\r\nspikelet having only four glumes the fourth glume differs from the\r\nothers mainly in texture. Instead of being thin and herbaceous it\r\nbecomes rigid and hard, smooth or rugose externally as in Panicum.\r\nFlowering glumes instead of being like empty glumes, become very thin,\r\nshorter and hyaline in Andropogon. Sometimes the flowering glumes are\r\nawned. All of them may be awned as in Chloris or only the fourth glume\r\nas in Andropogon.\r\n\r\nThe palea is fairly uniform in its structure in many grasses, but it is\r\nalso subject to variation. It becomes shorter in some and is absent in\r\nothers. Instead of having two nerves, it may have one and rarely more\r\nthan two. The palea can easily be distinguished from the glume, because\r\nits insertion in the spikelet is different from that of the glume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Flower of Chloris.\r\n\r\n1. lodicules; 2. stamens; 3. ovary.]\r\n\r\nThe =lodicules= are small organs and they are the vestiges of the\r\nperianth. In most grasses there are only two, but in Ochlandra and other\r\nbamboos we meet with three lodicules. There are also some species with\r\nmany lodicules. In shape they are mostly of some form referable to the\r\ncuneate form. They are of somewhat elongated form in Aristida and\r\nChloris. The function of the lodicules seems to be to separate the glume\r\nand its palea so as to enable the stamens to come out and hang freely at\r\nthe time of anthesis. So it is only at the time of the opening of the\r\nflowers that the lodicules are at their best. Then they are fairly\r\nlarge, fleshy and thick and conspicuous. In the bud stage they are\r\nusually small and after the opening of the flower they shrivel up and\r\nare inconspicuous. There are also species of grasses in which the\r\nlodicules are not found.\r\n\r\nThe =stamens= are three in number in the majority of grasses and six are\r\nmet with in Leersia, Hygrorhiza and Bamboos. Each stamen consists of a\r\nvery delicate long filament and an anther basifixed to the filament. But\r\nas the anthers are long and the connective is reduced to its minimum,\r\nthey appear as if versatile when the stamens are out. When there are\r\nthree stamens one stands in front of the flowering glumes and the other\r\ntwo in front of the palea, one opposite each edge of the palea. The\r\nrelative positions of the parts of the floret are shown in the floral\r\ndiagrams. (See figs. 18 and 19.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Floral diagrams.\r\n\r\nThe first is that of Chloris, second of Panicum and the third of Oryza.]\r\n\r\nThe =pistil= consists of an ovary and two styles ending in plumose\r\nstigmas. The ovary is 1-celled and 1-ovuled. It is one carpelled\r\naccording to the views of Hackel and his followers and there are also\r\nsome who consider it as 3-carpelled because of the occurrence of three\r\nstyles in the pistil of some bamboos.\r\n\r\nThe =rachilla= is usually well developed and elongated in many-flowered\r\nspikelets, while in 1-flowered spikelets it remains very small so that\r\nthe flower appears to be terminal. It often extends beyond the insertion\r\nof the terminal flower and its glume, and then lies hidden appressed to\r\nthe palea. This may be seen in the spikelets of the species of Cynodon.\r\nThis prolonged rachilla sometimes bears a minute glume, which is of\r\ncourse rudimentary. Usually the glumes are rather close together on the\r\nrachilla so that the internodes are very short; but in some grasses, as\r\nin _Dinebra arabica_, the glumes are rather distant and so the\r\ninternodes are somewhat longer and conspicuous. In some species of\r\nPanicum the rachilla is jointed to the pedicel below the empty glumes,\r\nwhereas it is articulated just above these glumes in _Chloris barbata_.\r\nSometimes the rachilla is articulated between the flowers. This is the\r\ncase in the spikelet of _Dinebra arabica_.\r\n\r\nPollination in most grasses is brought about by wind, though in a few\r\ncases self-pollination occurs. The terminal position of the\r\ninflorescence, its protrusion far above the level of the foliage leaves,\r\nthe swinging and dangling anthers, the abundance of non-sticking pollen\r\nand the plumose stigmas are all intended to facilitate pollination by\r\nwind. Furthermore the stamens and the stigmas do not mature at the same\r\ntime. In some grasses the stamens mature earlier, (=protandry=) while in\r\nothers the stigmas protrude long before the stamens (=protogyny=). As\r\nthe result of the pollination the ovary developes into a dry 1-seeded\r\nindehiscent fruit. The seed fills the cavity fully and the pericarp\r\nfuses with the seed-coat and so they are inseparable. Such a fruit is\r\ntermed a =caryopsis= or =grain=. Though in the vast majority of grasses\r\nthe pericarp is inseparable, in a few cases it is free from the\r\nseed-coat as in _Sporobolus indicus_ and _Eleusine indica_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Longitudinal section of a portion of the grain\r\nof Andropogon Sorghum. × 280 P. Pericarp; Sc. seed-coat; A. aleurone\r\nlayer; E. endosperm; S. scutellum; Rs. root-sheath; Rc. root-cap; R.\r\nradicle; Pl. plumule; G. growing point.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--A portion of the section of the grain of\r\nAndropogon Sorghum. × 500 P. pericarp; I. seed-coat; A. aleurone layer;\r\nS. starch.]\r\n\r\nThe caryopsis consists of an embryo on one side at the base and the\r\nendosperm occupies the remaining portion. The embryo can be made out on\r\nthe side of the grain facing the glume, as it is outlined as an oval\r\narea. On the other face of the grain which is towards the palea, the\r\nhilum is seen at the base. The grain varies in shape considerably. It\r\nmay be rounded, oval, ellipsoidal, narrow and cylindrical, oblong terete\r\nor furrowed. There is considerable variation as regards the colour also.\r\n\r\nThe =embryo= consists of an =axis= and a =scutellum=. The axis, which is\r\ndifferentiated into the plumule directed upward and the radicle\r\ndownward, is small and straight and it is covered more or less by the\r\nedges of the scutellum. The scutellum is attached to the axis at about\r\nits middle and its outer surface is in contact with the endosperm. This\r\nis an important organ as its function is to absorb nourishment from the\r\nendosperm during germination. The scutellum is considered to represent\r\nthe first leaf or cotyledon. The endosperm consists mostly of starch.\r\nJust outside the endosperm and within the epidermis lies a layer of\r\ncells containing much proteid substance. This layer is called the\r\n=aleurone layer=. (See fig. 21.) As an illustration of the caryopsis,\r\nthe grain of Andropogon Sorghum may be studied. All the structural\r\ndetails are shown in fig. 20 which is a longitudinal section of the\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe primary axis of the embryo is enclosed by a closed sheath both above\r\nand below. The sheath which envelopes the radicle is called =coleorhiza=\r\nand that of the plumule, =pileole= or =germ-sheath=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHISTOLOGY OF THE VEGETATIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shoots and roots of grasses conform in their internal structure to\r\nthe monocotyledonous type. In all grasses numerous threads are found\r\nrunning longitudinally within the stem and some of these pass into the\r\nleaves, at the nodes, and run as nerves in the blades of the leaves.\r\nThese threads are the vascular bundles. The rest of the tissue of the\r\nstem and leaves consists of thin-walled parenchymatous cells of\r\ndifferent sorts.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of these bundles is more or less the same in all\r\ngrasses. A vascular bundle consists of only xylem and phloëm, without\r\nthe cambium, and so no secondary thickening can take place in the stems\r\nof grasses. Such bundles as these are called =closed vascular bundles=\r\nto distinguish them from the dicotyledonous type of vascular bundles\r\nwhich are called =open vascular bundles= on account of the existence of\r\nthe cambium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Transverse section of a vascular bundle. × 250\r\n\r\n1. Annular vessel; 2. spiral vessel; 3. pitted vessel; 4. phloëm or\r\nsieve tubes; 5. sclerenchyma.]\r\n\r\nThe component parts and elements of which the vascular bundles in\r\ngrasses are composed may be learnt by studying the transverse and\r\nlongitudinal sections of these bundles in any grass. The cross and\r\nlongitudinal sections of a vascular bundle of the stem of _Pennisetum\r\ncenchroides_, are shown in figs. 22 and 23. In the figure of the\r\ntransverse section the two large cavities indicated by the number 3 and\r\nthe two small circular cavities with thick walls lying between the\r\nlarger ones and indicated by the numbers 1 and 2 are the chief elements\r\nof the xylem.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the longitudinal section it is obvious that these elements\r\nare really vessels, the larger being pitted and the smaller annular and\r\nspiral vessels. These vessels together with the numerous small\r\nthick-walled cells lying between the pitted vessels constitute the\r\nxylem. Just above the xylem there is a group of large and small\r\nthin-walled cells. This is the phloëm and it consists of sieve tubes and\r\nthin-walled cells. All round the xylem and the phloëm there are many\r\nthick-walled cells. These are really fibres forming the =bundle-sheath=.\r\nOn account of this bundle-sheath the bundles are called =fibro-vascular\r\nbundles=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Longitudinal section of a vascular bundle. ×\r\n250\r\n\r\n1. Annular vessel; 2. spiral vessel; 3. pitted vessel; 4. sieve tubes or\r\nphloëm; 5. sclerenchyma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nRottboellia exaltata. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\n=Structure of the stem.=--The stem of a grass consists of a mass of\r\nparenchymatous cells with a number of fibro-vascular bundles imbedded in\r\nit, and it is covered externally by a protective layer of cells, the\r\nepidermis. The stem is usually solid in all grasses in the young stage,\r\nbut as it matures the internodes become hollow in many grasses and they\r\nremain solid in a few. In the internodes the fibro-vascular bundles run\r\nlongitudinally and are parallel, but in the nodes they run in all\r\ndirections and form a net work from which emerge a few bundles to enter\r\nthe leaves. So far as the broad general features are concerned, the\r\nstems of many grasses are more or less similar in structure. However,\r\nwhen we take into consideration the arrangement of bundles, the\r\ndevelopment and arrangement of sclerenchyma, every species of grass has\r\nits own special characteristics. And these are so striking and constant\r\nthat it may be possible to identify the species from these characters\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWe may take as a type the stem of _Rottboellia exaltata_. This stem is\r\nsomewhat semi-circular in transverse section and it is almost straight\r\nand flat in the front (the side towards the axillary bud). The\r\nperipheral portion of the stem becomes somewhat rigid and thick due to\r\nthe aggregation of vascular bundles, some small and others large. The\r\noutermost series of bundles consisting of small and larger bundles are\r\nin contact with the layers of the cells lying just beneath the epidermis\r\nand these cells are also thick-walled. A few are away from these being\r\nseparated by three or four layers of cells from the peripheral bundles.\r\nIn all these vascular bundles the bundle-sheath is very strongly\r\ndeveloped all round and is very much developed especially at the sides.\r\nIt is this great development of sclerenchyma that makes the outer\r\nportion of the cortex hard. Within the ground tissue are found a number\r\nof vascular bundles scattered more or less uniformly. These bundles have\r\nno continuous bundle-sheaths but have instead groups of fibres at the\r\nsides and in front of the phloëm. The cavities near the annular vessels\r\nare somewhat larger and conspicuous in these bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Transverse section of the stem of Pennisetum\r\ncenchroides. × 20]\r\n\r\nThe epidermal cells are all thickened very much and the outer layer is\r\ncutinized and impregnated with silica. This is the case in the epidermis\r\nof the stems and leaves of most grasses. (See fig. 24.)\r\n\r\nIn order to give a general idea of the variations in the structure of\r\nthe stem in grasses a few examples are chosen and the details of the\r\nstructure of the stems of these grasses are dealt with here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPennisetum cenchroides. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nThe stem of _Pennisetum cenchroides_ is somewhat round in outline in the\r\ntransverse section with a slight curvature in the front. The vascular\r\nbundles are rather numerous and irregularly scattered all over the\r\nground tissue. The peripheral bundles are not so close to the periphery\r\nof the stem as in _Rottboellia exaltata_. These are separated from the\r\nepidermis by several layers of parenchymatous cells. Further, these\r\nperipheral bundles are all imbedded in a continuous sclerenchymatous\r\nband which runs round the stem in the form of a ring. The epidermal\r\ncells as well as the layer of cells in immediate contact with it are\r\nthick-walled. In the vascular bundles of the ground tissue the\r\nbundle-sheath is rather prominent and the phloëm portion is well\r\ndeveloped. (See figs. 25 and 26.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Transverse section of the stem of Eriochloa\r\npolystachya. × 25]\r\n\r\nIn the stem of _Eriochloa polystachya_, all the vascular bundles are\r\nmore or less peripheral in position leaving a wide area of\r\nparenchymatous cells in the centre. The outline of the stem in cross\r\nsection is rotund or ovate-rotund with the front side somewhat flattened\r\nand straight. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. A well developed\r\ncontinuous ring of sclerenchyma is present and this is connected with\r\nthe epidermal layer at short intervals by means of short\r\nsclerenchymatous bands. So the parenchymatous cells of the cortex lying\r\noutside the sclerenchymatous ring are divided into small isolated areas.\r\nThere are three series of vascular bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nEriochloa polystachya. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nOne series consists of small bundles lying inside the sclerenchyma ring\r\nat the base of each of the connecting bands. The second series is made\r\nup of large vascular bundles imbedded in the ring so as to bulge out\r\ninside the ring. The vascular bundles of the third series are found just\r\naway from the ring and separated from it by a few layers of\r\nparenchymatous cells. (See figs. 27 and 28.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Transverse section of the stem of Setaria\r\nglauca. × 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nSetaria glauca. × 50\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nAnother stem in which the vascular bundles are more or less peripheral\r\nin position and enclosing a wide parenchyma is that of _Setaria glauca_.\r\nIn the transverse section of the stem the outline is ovate, laterally\r\ncompressed, obtusely keeled at the back and somewhat concave in the\r\nfront. The sclerenchymatous band is narrow and continuous and very close\r\nto the epidermis, being separated from it only by two or three layers of\r\nthin-walled cells. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. As to the\r\nvascular bundles there are three sets. One set of bundles lying just\r\noutside the sclerenchymatous ring consists of small ones connecting the\r\nring with the epidermis. Just inside the sclerenchymatous ring lies a\r\nseries of bundles which are connected with it. Still inside, at some\r\ndistance from the sclerenchymatous band, are seen vascular bundles\r\nforming a row and enclosing a large space of the ground tissue\r\nconsisting of only parenchyma. (See figs. 29 and 30.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum\r\nramosum × 24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum ramosum. × 75\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Transverse section of the stem of Andropogon\r\ncaricosus. × 25]\r\n\r\nThe stem of _Panicum ramosum_ is semi-circular and somewhat flat on one\r\nside. The epidermal cells alone are thickened. There is a broad well\r\ndeveloped continuous band of sclerenchyma, which is connected at regular\r\nintervals with the epidermis by small vascular bundles. Another row of\r\nvascular bundles lies just inside the sclerenchymatous ring and each of\r\nthese bundles is in contact with the band. Away from the ring lie a\r\nnumber of bundles forming a series disposed in two irregular rings\r\naround a broad portion of the ground tissue. (See figs. 31 and 32.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nAndropogon caricosus. × 75\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum Isachne. × 100\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nThe stem of the grass _Andropogon caricosus_ is oval in outline, the\r\nfront being flat. The epidermal cells and those below and in contact\r\nwith them are thick-walled. The sclerenchymatous ring though present is\r\nvery narrow and not very conspicuous. It consists of one or two layers\r\nof cells connecting a few vascular bundles forming the outermost set.\r\nThere is a series of vascular bundles inside the ring which surrounds a\r\nlarge area of the ground tissue. Two isolated bundles, one in front and\r\nanother at the back of the ground tissue, are found. The cells of the\r\nground tissue lying just inside the vascular bundles are all very much\r\nthickened. (See figs. 33 and 34.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Transverse section of the stem of Eragrostis\r\ninterrupta. × 25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum\r\nflavidum. × 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum flavidum. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nThe stems of _Panicum Isachne_ and _Eragrostis interrupta_ are hollow.\r\nThe stem of the former is circular in outline in cross section, though\r\nwavy. There is a sclerenchymatous ring close to the epidermis but\r\nseparated from it by a few layers of parenchyma. One set of bundles is\r\nimbedded in the band, and another set just touches the inner border of\r\nit. A third series is disposed around a fairly large amount of ground\r\ntissue, which may or may not have a cavity in the centre. The stem of\r\n_Eragrostis_ _interrupta_ has more or less the same structure, but the\r\ncortex has air spaces here and there. Other minor differences may be\r\nseen on referring to figs. 35 and 36.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum colonum. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nThe stems of grasses growing in wet or marshy situations differ in\r\nstructure from those detailed above. As examples the stems of _Panicum\r\nflavidum_, _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum Crus-galli_ and _Panicum\r\nfluitans_ may be considered. The stem of _Panicum flavidum_ is broadly\r\novate in cross section with a flat front and is more or less solid,\r\nthough occasionally the parenchymatous cells in the centre get broken.\r\nTwo rows of vascular bundles surround a fairly large amount of\r\nparenchymatous cells of the ground tissue. There is a continuous ring of\r\nsclerenchyma separated from the epidermis by a fairly broad cortex. The\r\ncortex has a number of fairly large air-cavities separated by bands of\r\nparenchymatous cells. Within the sclerenchymatous band lie small\r\nvascular bundles at regular intervals just towards the cortex. A few\r\nisolated bundles are in contact with the inner border. (See figs. 37 and\r\n38.)\r\n\r\nThe stems of _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum stagninum_ and _Panicum\r\nCrus-galli_ have in their centre in the ground tissue stellate cells\r\nwith air-cavities. This part is surrounded by a fairly broad portion of\r\nparenchymatous cells in which are imbedded two rows of bundles. Outside\r\nthese bundles runs round the stem a narrow sclerenchymatous band with a\r\nfew bundles in it of which some touch it inside and others outside. Two\r\nbundles are found by themselves in the tissue of stellate cells. In\r\n_Panicum Crus-galli_ three or four bundles are met with amidst the\r\nstellate cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum Crus-galli. × 70\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum\r\nstagninum. × 10]\r\n\r\nThe cortex outside the band of sclerenchyma is full of air-cavities,\r\nsmall and large. In _Panicum colonum_ the outline of the stem is\r\nellipsoidal with the front quite flat, and the cortex is narrow at the\r\nsides and very broad in front and at the back. The sclerenchymatous ring\r\nis circular in outline. The stem of _Panicum Crus-galli_ is broadly\r\novoid and the cortex is uniformly broad. The epidermal cells as well as\r\nthe lower cells are thickened in the stems of _Panicum fluitans_ and\r\n_Panicum Crus-galli_, but in the stems of _Panicum colonum_ and _Panicum\r\nflavidum_ the epidermis alone is thickened. In the cortical portion\r\noutside the sclerenchymatous band, small vascular bundles occur in the\r\nstems of _Panicum colonum_, _Panicum Crus-galli_ and _Panicum fluitans_.\r\n(See figs. 39, 40, 42 and 43.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Transverse section of the stem of Panicum\r\nfluitans. × 15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Transverse section of a portion of the stem of\r\nPanicum fluitans. × 60\r\n\r\n1. Epidermis; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. vascular bundle; 4. air-cavity; 5.\r\ndiaphragm.]\r\n\r\nThe stem of _Panicum fluitans_ is round in outline in the transverse\r\nsection and has a large cavity. Just close to the cavity and separated\r\nfrom it by only one or two parenchymatous cells are found vascular\r\nbundles forming a series. Outside this series of bundles lies a\r\nsclerenchymatous band which is wavy, following the lower edges of the\r\nlarge air-cavities. One series of bundles is connected with this\r\nsclerenchymatous ring. The air-cavities are large and uniform and are\r\nseparated by bands of parenchymatous cells. In each of these bands lies\r\na vascular bundle on the upper side near the periphery. Sometimes we\r\nfind, especially in young stages, diaphragms of stellulate cells\r\nstretched across the air-cavities. Later as the stem matures these\r\ndisappear and the cavities become conspicuous. (See figs. 42 and 43.)\r\n\r\n=Structure of the root.=--As already stated, the roots of grasses\r\nconform to the monocotyledonous type, but the variations met with in\r\ntheir structure are not so great as in the case of the stem. The\r\nroot-tips are protected by root-caps, and the actual tip of the root is\r\nvery distinct in the roots of all grasses and it can be seen very\r\nclearly in a longitudinal section of the root. The actual tip of the\r\nroot is sharply distinct from the root-cap as there are two distinct\r\nsets of cells, one giving rise to the root-tip and the other to the\r\nroot-cap.\r\n\r\nThe young root-tips are always free from root-hairs, and they are\r\nconfined to the portions behind the root-tips. The extent of the\r\nroot-hair region will vary according to the vigour and development of\r\nthe roots and the nature of the soil. The root-hairs are mere\r\nprotrusions of the cells of the outermost layer of the cortex of the\r\nroot and this layer is called the =piliferous layer=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Transverse section of a part of the root of\r\nPennisetum cenchroides. × 100\r\n\r\n1. Root-hair; 2. piliferous layer; 3. cortex; 4. endodermis; 5.\r\npericycle; 6. xylem; 7. phloëm.]\r\n\r\nTo learn the structure of the roots of grasses we may select as types\r\nthe roots of _Pennisetum cenchroides_ and _Andropogon Sorghum_ and\r\nconsider their structural details. In the transverse sections of these\r\nroots we find a fairly broad cortex consisting of thin-walled\r\nparenchymatous cells more or less regularly arranged. (See figs. 44 and\r\n45.) Just below the piliferous layer two or three layers of thick-walled\r\ncells are seen. In the roots of _Andropogon Sorghum_ these thick-walled\r\ncells are very conspicuous as they consist of several layers. These\r\nlayers of thick-walled cells constitute the =exodermis=. (See fig. 46.)\r\nThe innermost layer of cells of the cortex is called the =endodermis=\r\nand it becomes conspicuous on account of the thickening in the lateral\r\nand inner walls of the cells of this layer. (See figs. 44 and 47.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Transverse section of the entire root of\r\nAndropogon Sorghum. × 25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Transverse section of the cortical portion of\r\nthe root of Andropogon Sorghum. × 150\r\n\r\nr.h. Root-hair; p.l. piliferous layer; ex. exodermis; co. cortex.]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the root forming the central core is the stele and at its\r\nperiphery there is a single layer of cells called the =pericycle=. The\r\narrangement of the xylem and the phloëm is different from that of the\r\nstem. They lie side by side on different radii, and not one behind the\r\nother on the same radius as in the stem. The number of xylem groups is\r\nfairly large and the development of the xylem is from the pericycle\r\ntowards the centre of the stele. (See figs. 44 and 45.) The\r\nparenchymatous cells in the centre of the stele become thick-walled in\r\nolder roots.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the leaf.=--The structure of the leaf of grasses is quite\r\ncharacteristic of the family. In every leaf a number of vascular\r\nbundles, some small and others large, pass from the base to the apex.\r\nExternally the leaf is covered on both the sides by the epidermis. The\r\nspaces existing between the vascular bundles and the epidermis are\r\nfilled with parenchymatous cells. The larger vascular bundles consist of\r\nxylem and phloëm surrounded by a bundle sheath of a single layer of\r\ncells. In the smaller bundles the xylem is very much reduced. Around\r\nevery vascular bundle there is a single row of somewhat large cells\r\ndensely packed with large chloroplasts, the =chlorophyllous layer=. The\r\nvascular bundles are strengthened by fibres, on both the sides in the\r\ncase of larger bundles and on only one side in small bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Transverse section of the stele portion of the\r\nroot of Andropogon Sorghum. × 150\r\n\r\nCo. Cortex; en. endodermis; pe. pericycle; ph. phloëm; pr. protoxylem;\r\nxy. xylem vessel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--A portion of the transverse section of the leaf\r\nof Panicum javanicum. × 100\r\n\r\nEp. c. An ordinary epidermal cell; st. stomata; sc. sclerenchyma; ph.\r\nphloëm; chl c. chlorenchyma; m. motor cells; xy. xylem.]\r\n\r\nFor a detailed study of the structure of the leaves of grasses the leaf\r\nof the grass _Panicum javanicum_ may be chosen. In a transverse section\r\nof this leaf, the vascular bundles are very conspicuous. The larger\r\nbundles are normal in every way, while in the smaller ones the xylem\r\nelements are considerably reduced. Around every one of the vascular\r\nbundles there is a single row of large cells containing large\r\nchlorophyll grains (the chlorophyllous layer). In a well developed large\r\nvascular bundle the chlorophyllous layer is open below just close to the\r\nsclerenchymatous band. On both sides of the larger vascular bundle there\r\nare bands of sclerenchyma. In the case of smaller bundles some are\r\nstrengthened by sclerenchyma on the lower side and others have none. The\r\nspaces between the bundles are occupied by thin-walled parenchymatous\r\ncells containing small chlorophyll grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Upper epidermis of the leaf of Panicum\r\njavanicum. × 300]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Lower epidermis of the leaf of Panicum\r\njavanicum. × 300]\r\n\r\nThe lower epidermis of the leaf in the transverse section is even and\r\nconsists of small and large round cells. The upper epidermis is slightly\r\nwavy and it is made up of some small round cells alternating with groups\r\nof larger cells. The epidermal cells lying over sclerenchyma and the\r\nsmaller vascular bundles are small and round, while those lying over the\r\nfurrows between the vascular bundles are large and are called =motor= or\r\n=bulliform cells=. The presence of motor cells is a characteristic\r\nfeature of the leaves of many grasses.\r\n\r\nThe continuity of both the upper and the lower epidermis is interrupted\r\nby the stomata. Air-cavities are seen below these stomata. The\r\narrangement of the stomata, the shape of the guard cells and the\r\ncharacteristics of the epidermal cells become clear on examining a piece\r\nof epidermis. (See figs. 49 and 50.)\r\n\r\nThe structure of the leaf of _Panicum javanicum_ may be taken as typical\r\nof the structure of the leaves of most grasses. The leaves of _Eriochloa\r\npolystachya_, Cynodon and Paspalums are very much like the leaves of\r\n_Panicum javanicum_ in their internal structure.\r\n\r\nConsiderable amount of variation, however, occurs in the leaves of\r\ngrasses especially as regards the arrangement of fibres and motor cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--A portion of the transverse section of the leaf\r\nof Eriochloa polystachya × 120\r\n\r\n1. Motor cell; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\nEvery large primary vascular bundle in the leaves of many grasses\r\npossesses sclerenchymatous bands both above and below. The other\r\nvascular bundles may have bands of sclerenchyma on both sides or on one\r\nside only or none. For example, in the leaves of _Panicum repens_ both\r\nthe primary and secondary bundles are provided with sclerenchyma on both\r\nthe sides, while those of the third order may have it on one side or\r\nnot. The hyaline margin of this leaf and of the leaves of other grasses\r\nconsists entirely of sclerenchyma. (See fig. 53.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nPanicum repens. × 120\r\n\r\n1. Motor cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\nAll the vascular bundles in the leaves of _Aristida setacea_ have broad\r\nsclerenchymatous bands on both the sides. Besides these bands arranged\r\nlike a girder above and below each bundle, there are on the lower side\r\nbands of sclerenchyma. So the sclerenchyma becomes almost continuous on\r\nthe lower side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Transverse section of the leaf margin of\r\nPanicum repens. × 180\r\n\r\n1. Sclerenchyma; 2. stomata; 3. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Transverse section of a part of the leaf of\r\nAristida setacea. × 30.\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. motor cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nAristida setacea. × 120\r\n\r\n1. Motor cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. epidermis; 5. cutin\r\nlayer.]\r\n\r\nThe sclerenchyma lying on the lower side of the primary bundles are\r\ncontiguous with the bundle, while those above are separated from the\r\nbundle by the chlorophyllous layer. (See fig. 55.) In the case of\r\nsecondary and tertiary bundles the sclerenchymatous bands lying on the\r\nlower side are in contact with the chlorophyllous layer, whereas the\r\nupper bands are either in contact with this layer or separated from it\r\nby a few parenchymatous cells.\r\n\r\nAll the vascular bundles in the leaves of _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_ are\r\nprovided with sclerenchyma on both the sides. The lower band of the\r\nprimary vascular bundles is continuous with the vascular bundle, the\r\nchlorophyllous layer being open below. The upper bands of the primary\r\nand the lower bands of the secondary vascular bundles just touch the\r\nchlorophyllous layer. In the secondary bundles the sclerenchyma band\r\nabove is separated from the chlorophyllous layer by two layers of\r\nparenchyma. In the case of the leaves of _Panicum flavidum_, _P.\r\ncolonum_, _P. fluitans_ and _Pennisetum cenchroides_ the sclerenchyma is\r\nseparated from the chlorophyllous layer by layers of parenchyma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Transverse section of a part of the leaf of\r\nEragrostis Willdenoviana. × 30\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. motor cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nEragrostis Willdenoviana. × 150\r\n\r\n1. Motor cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer; 5.\r\nvascular strand cut through; 6. hair.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Transverse section of a part of the leaf of\r\nPanicum colonum. × 30\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. motor cells.]\r\n\r\nEven from the few examples dealt with above, it is obvious that the\r\nrange of variation of sclerenchyma in leaves is very great. In the\r\nleaves of _Aristida setacea_ there is a considerable amount of\r\nsclerenchyma whilst in some leaves such as those of _Panicum_ _colonum_,\r\n_P. flavidum_ and _Panicum fluitans_ the sclerenchyma is reduced to its\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Transverse section of a part of the leaf of\r\nPanicum fluitans. × 30\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma.]\r\n\r\nIn the leaves of grasses growing in dry situations the development of\r\nsclerenchyma is generally very considerable. The grass _Aristida\r\nsetacea_ is a good example of a xerophytic grass. The sea-shore grass\r\n_Spinifex squarrosus_ is another example of the same kind. But in the\r\nleaves of this grass, the development of sclerenchyma is not very\r\nconsiderable, but there is a great development of parenchymatous cells\r\nfree from chlorophyll within the leaf, the chlorophyll bearing cells\r\nbeing confined to the upper and the lower surfaces of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Transverse section of a leaf of Spinifex\r\nsquarrosus. × 10\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--A portion of the transverse section of the leaf\r\nof Spinifex squarrosus. × 60\r\n\r\n1. Sclerenchyma; 2. vascular bundle; 3. epidermis; 4. stomata.]\r\n\r\nThe upper and the lower surfaces of the leaves of many grasses are more\r\nor less even, but in the case of a few grasses the upper surface\r\nconsists of ridges and furrows, instead of being even. In the leaves of\r\n_Panicum repens_ and _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_ the upper surface is\r\nwavy and consists of shallow furrows and slightly raised ridges. But in\r\nthe leaves of _Aristida setacea_ and _Panicum fluitans_ the furrows are\r\ndeeper and the ridges are more prominent. In _Aristida setacea_ the\r\nridges are flat-topped and they are rounded with broad furrows in\r\n_Panicum fluitans_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Upper epidermis of the leaf Panicum Isachne. ×\r\n200\r\n\r\n1. Cells overlying the veins; 2. cells overlying the furrows; 3.\r\nstomata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Lower epidermis of the leaf Panicum Isachne. ×\r\n200\r\n\r\n1. Cells overlying the veins; 2. cells overlying the furrows; 3.\r\nstomata.]\r\n\r\nThe epidermis covering the leaves consists of elongated cells with plane\r\nor sinuous walls, various kinds of short cells intercalated between the\r\nends of long cells, motor-cells and stomata. Hairs of different sorts\r\noccur as outgrowths of the epidermis. The roughness of the surface of\r\nthe leaves of grasses is due to the presence of very minute short hairs\r\nborne by the epidermis. In most cases these short hairs are found in\r\nregular rows. Although the epidermis is more or less even in the leaves\r\nof several grasses such as _Panicum repens_, _P. flavidum_ and\r\n_Eriochloa polystachya_, it is wavy or undulating in the leaves of a few\r\ngrasses. For example, the upper epidermis in the leaves of _Panicum\r\nfluitans_ is undulating as it follows the contour of the ridges and\r\nfurrows.\r\n\r\nThe epidermal cells have even surfaces in the leaves of most grasses but\r\nin some they bulge out. In the leaves of _Panicum flavidum_ the cells of\r\nthe lower epidermis are quite even, whilst those of the upper epidermis\r\nbulge out. The cells of both the upper and the lower epidermis are\r\ndistinctly bulging out in the leaves of _Panicum colonum_. In _Panicum\r\nfluitans_ the cells of the upper epidermis bulge out so much as to form\r\ndistinct papillæ.\r\n\r\nThe free surface of the epidermis is more or less cutinised in the\r\nleaves of all grasses. In some leaves the cuticle is very thick and even\r\npapillate as in the leaves of _Aristida setacea_ and _Panicum repens_\r\nwhilst in others it is very thin, as in the leaves of _Panicum colonum_\r\nand _P. fluitans_. Cutinisation is rather prominent in the leaves of\r\ngrasses growing under dry conditions and it is less pronounced in\r\nmesophytic grasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nPanicum colonum. × 120\r\n\r\n1. Motor cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nPanicum fluitans. × 120\r\n\r\n1. Motor cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\nAs regards size, the epidermal cells overlying the sclerenchyma are\r\nsmall and those lying over parenchyma are larger. Amongst the larger\r\ncells some may be motor-cells. The stomata occur in regular rows between\r\nthe vascular bundles and they are quite characteristic of grasses. They\r\nare more or less similar in structure in all grasses. In the leaves of\r\nmany grasses stomata are found in both the upper and the lower epidermis\r\nand they are confined to the lower epidermis in a few grasses only.\r\n\r\nThe motor-cells vary very much both as regards their shape and position.\r\nIn some leaves as in the leaves of the grass _Panicum flavidum_ the\r\nmotor-cells are confined to the midrib on the upper surface.\r\n\r\nThe epidermal cells of this leaf are large and uniformly round. (See\r\nfigs. 66 and 67.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Transverse section of a leaf of Panicum\r\nflavidum. × 20\r\n\r\n1. Vascular bundle; 2. sclerenchyma; 3. motor-cells.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Transverse section of the leaf of Panicum\r\nflavidum. × 150\r\n\r\n1. Motor-cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of most grasses the motor-cells are found in groups of\r\nthree, four or five between the vascular bundles. The central motor-cell\r\nis usually the largest and it is somewhat obovate in shape in a\r\ntransverse section of the leaf. In the leaves of _Panicum javanicum_ and\r\n_Eriochloa polystachya_ there are three or four motor cells in the group\r\nand the group consists of four, five or rarely six motor cells in the\r\nleaves of _Eragrostis Willdenoviana_. When there are distinct furrows\r\nbetween ridges these cells lie in the furrows and they are many in\r\nnumber. In the leaves of _Panicum repens_ there are five to seven\r\nmotor-cells in the furrows and the single row of cells stretched between\r\nthe motor-cells and the lower epidermis in the furrow consists of more\r\nor less clear cells with sparsely scattered small chlorophyll grains.\r\n(See fig. 52.) The motor-cells occupying the furrows in the leaves of\r\n_Aristida setacea_ are more in number than in _Panicum repens_ and are\r\nof a different shape. All the cells lying in the furrow between the\r\nmotor-cells and the sclerenchyma are clear cells free from chlorophyll\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nAlthough the motor-cells differ in shape from the ordinary epidermal\r\ncells in most grasses, there are, however, a few grasses in which the\r\nmotor-cells do not differ very much from the epidermal cells except in\r\nsize. For example, in the leaves of _Panicum colonum_ the motor-cells\r\nare just like the ordinary epidermal cells in shape but are larger. (See\r\nfig. 64.)\r\n\r\nMotor-cells are usually confined to the upper epidermis, but they may\r\nalso be found in the lower epidermis. In the leaves of _Pennisetum\r\ncenchroides_ motor-cells are found in both the upper and the lower\r\nepidermis, the group in the upper epidermis alternating with that in the\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Transverse section of a portion of the leaf of\r\nPennisetum cenchroides. × 100\r\n\r\n1. Motor-cells; 2. stomata; 3. sclerenchyma; 4. chlorophyllous layer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family Gramineæ is usually divided into two series taking into\r\nconsideration the presence or absence of a joint in the pedicel or\r\nrachis, the number of flowers in the spikelet and the position of the\r\nfertile flower. All the species in which there is a joint just below the\r\nspikelet, in the pedicel, in the rachis, or at the base of a cluster of\r\nspikelets come under one series =Panicaceæ=. The spikelets of the\r\ngrasses coming under this series, when mature, fall away singly by\r\nthemselves, or with their pedicels, or in groups with portions of the\r\nrachis. The spikelets are all similar and consist of usually four\r\nglumes. Each spikelet contains a single perfect flower and sometimes in\r\naddition a staminate flower just below the perfect flower. In this\r\nseries the tendency for imperfection is always confined to the lower\r\nflowers, the terminal flower alone being perfect. For inclusion under\r\nthis series the grass plant should have both the characters,\r\narticulation and position of the flower as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe second series =Poaceæ= includes those grasses in which the spikelets\r\nare one to many-flowered and continuous with their pedicels. But the\r\nrachilla of the spikelet may be jointed just above the empty glumes or\r\nbetween the flowering glumes.

It is very well represented in South India\r\nand fifteen genera are met with.\r\n\r\nThe inflorescence varies very much within this tribe and consists of\r\nspikes, racemes and panicles. The spikelets are usually four-glumed and\r\ncontain one terminal perfect flower and a staminate or neutral flower\r\nbelow. But in the genus Isachne both the flowers are perfect. In some\r\ngrasses the spikelets contain only staminate or pistillate flowers. In\r\nCoix and Polytoca the plant bears both male and female spikelets in the\r\nsame inflorescence, but in Zea on the same plant they occur as distinct\r\ninflorescences. The littoral grass Spinifex is dioecious.\r\n\r\nThe first glume of the spikelet is the smallest. In Panicum it is nearly\r\ntwo-thirds or less than the third glume. It is very small in Digitaria\r\nand entirely suppressed in Paspalum. In Eriochloa it is reduced to a\r\nminute ridge lying just close to the swollen ring-like joint of the\r\nrachilla. The second and the third glumes are more or less equal and\r\nsimilar in texture. The fourth glume becomes firm and rigid along with\r\nits palea and usually encloses the grain.\r\n\r\nThe pedicel is jointed in some genera and in others it is continuous\r\nwith the spikelet and not jointed. When mature the spikelets fall away\r\neither by themselves, singly with their pedicels or in groups with\r\nportions of rachis, according to the position of the joint. Bristles\r\n(branchlets) are often found on the pedicels. In Setaria a few are borne\r\nby the pedicels. The bristles form a regular involucre at the base of a\r\ngroup of spikelets in Pennisetum, and in Cenchrus these become united at\r\nthe base into a mass forming a kind of burr around the spikelets.\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE GENERA.\r\n\r\n  A.

The spikelets are plano-convex,\r\norbicular to oblong, obtuse, secund, 2-ranked on the flattened or\r\ntriquetrous rachis of the spike-like branches of a raceme, one-flowered\r\nand falling off entire from the very short or obscure pedicels. There\r\nare three glumes, all more or less equal and similar. The first and the\r\nsecond glumes are membranous, alike and as long as the third, the second\r\nglume is usually epaleate and occasionally with a minute palea. The\r\nthird glume is chartaceous to sub-coriaceous and paleate. Lodicules are\r\ntwo and small. Stamens are three. The styles are slender and distinct\r\nwith plumose stigmas exserted at the top of the spikelet.

The _first glume_ is concave, 3- to 5-nerved\r\n(rarely 3- to 7-nerved). The _second glume_ is flat, 5-nerved, with two\r\nstrong sub-marginal nerves, sometimes with shallow transverse pits along\r\nthe margins. The _third glume_ is thickly coriaceous, brownish, shining,\r\nminutely striolate, margins roundly incurved throughout its length,\r\npaleate; the _palea_ is similar to the glume in structure and colour,\r\nmargins strongly inflexed and with two broad membranous auricles almost\r\noverlapping just below the middle. There are three _stamens_. The\r\n_stigmas_ are white both when young and while fading. The style branches\r\nare diverging widely and then straight. There are two oblong cuneate\r\nfleshy _lodicules_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Paspalum scrobiculatum.\r\n\r\n1 and 2.

There\r\nare two forms of this grass, one with round and another with ovate\r\noblong spikelets. They also vary in the size of the spikelets--some\r\nforms have small spikelets and others large. Sometimes the spikelets\r\nshow variation in the number of glumes.\r\n\r\nThis grass is also cultivated for its grain. In cultivated forms the\r\nspikelets are larger and the whole plant grows bigger.

The second glume is membranous, 1- to 5-nerved or\r\nnerveless. The third glume is membranous, almost equal to the fourth,\r\nusually 7- to 9-nerved, the nerves being straight, close, parallel and\r\nprominent, with a minute palea or without a palea. The fourth glume is\r\nchartaceous or sub-chartaceous, usually 3-nerved and paleate; palea is\r\nequal to and similar to the fourth glume, 2-nerved. Lodicules are two,\r\nsmall, broadly cuneate.

The _ligule_ is merely a dense\r\nfringe of long hairs. _Nodes_ are tumid, purplish, covered with long\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf-blade_ is flat but convolute when young, lanceolate or\r\nlinear-lanceolate, acuminate, base rounded and margin with minute\r\nserrations. It is glabrous or occasionally hairy with scattered,\r\ntubercle-based, deciduous hairs, and varying in length from 1 to 3\r\ninches generally (sometimes in well-grown plants it is 5 inches) and in\r\nbreadth from 1/8 to 1/4 inch.

The\r\n_spikes_ are erect, pressed to the very slender rachis, longer than the\r\ninternodes of the main rachis, stalked or sessile, mostly simple but\r\nsometimes the lower dividing into two or three branches, 1/2 to 1 inch\r\nlong. The rachis of the spike is very slender, angular, flexuous,\r\nnarrower than the spikelets, scaberulous with a few long cilia at the\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nThe _spikelets_ are very small, 1/16 inch long, turned all to one side\r\nand closely packed in two rows, oblong or oval-oblong, obtuse or\r\nsubacute, softly hairy, pale green or purplish, with very short pedicels\r\nwhich are pubescent with a few long hairs towards the thickened cupular\r\ntips.\r\n\r\nThere are four _glumes_ in the spikelet. The _first glume_ is very\r\nsmall, membranous, glabrous, broader than long, cordate or triangular,\r\nbroadly but shallowly emarginate, nerveless or very obscurely 1- to\r\n2-nerved. The _second glume_ is pale or purplish, 5-nerved, hairy, as\r\nlong as the third glume, membranous, oblong and obtuse. The _third\r\nglume_ is pale, nearly equal to the second glume with a longitudinal\r\ndepression at the back, less hairy than the second glume, 3-nerved\r\n(rarely 5-nerved also); _palea_ is present, and it is hyaline, shorter\r\nthan the glume, truncate or shallowly retuse, usually barren but\r\noccasionally with three stamens. The _fourth glume_ is oblong, rounded,\r\ncoriaceous, smooth, shining, dorsally flattened, 3- or indistinctly\r\n5-nerved; _palea_ is similar to the glume in texture and with folded\r\nmargins. There are three _stamens_ with yellow anthers. _Lodicules_ are\r\ntwo, very small and distinct. _Ovary_ has two styles with feathery\r\n_stigmas_ white at first, but turning deep purple while withering.\r\n\r\nThis delicate and small grass occurs here and there as mere tufts\r\nespecially in sheltered situations. It usually flourishes in black\r\ncotton soils amidst cholam (_Andropogon Sorghum_), although it thrives\r\nequally well in other rich soils. This is considered to be a very good\r\nfodder grass.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--It is fairly common all over the Madras Presidency, and\r\ngoes up to 3,000 or 4,000 feet.

It is very\r\nwell represented in South India and some genera are of very wide\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nThe spikelets are usually arranged in pairs at each joint, one sessile\r\nand the other stalked. The spikelets may all be similar as in Imperata\r\nor they may be different as in Ischæmum and Andropogon. There may be\r\nonly one flower in the spikelet as in Eremochloa and Saccharum or two as\r\nin Ischæmum and Apocopis. In the genera Polytoca and Coix the spikelets\r\nare unisexual and the male and female spikelets are found in the same\r\ninflorescence, the female being below and the male being continuous with\r\nit. The spikelet nearly always consists of four glumes, the first or the\r\nfirst and the second being firmer and coriaceous or chartaceous. The\r\nflowering glumes are always shorter than the empty glumes, and are\r\nhyaline. The fourth glume is often awned or reduced to an awn.\r\n\r\nThe main rachis of the inflorescence is usually jointed at the base. In\r\naddition to this the rachis may be jointed all along its length, so as\r\nto become separated into distinct joints when mature as in Rottboellia,\r\nSaccharum and Andropogon, or it may be continuous as in Imperata. The\r\npedicels of spikelets and the lower portions of the rachilla of the\r\nspikelets may have long hairs.\r\n\r\nSub.

The stem is slender, green,\r\nor pale reddish in the exposed portions and pale in parts covered by\r\nsheaths slightly flattened, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf-sheaths_ are smooth, compressed, distinctly keeled. The\r\n_ligule_ is a short, truncate, white, glabrous membrane. The _nodes_ are\r\nglabrous.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf-blade_ is linear, finely acuminate, glabrous, but sometimes\r\nsomewhat scabrid along the nerves and with scattered long delicate hairs\r\nabove especially when young, varying in length from 1 to 7 inches and\r\n1/10 to 1/8 inch in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe _inflorescence_ consists of paired spikes with very slender\r\npeduncles arising from flattened, glabrous, acuminate spathes, varying\r\nin length from 1/2 to 1-1/4 inches. The _spikes_ are spreading and one\r\nof them always slightly longer than the other, reddish or pale green,\r\n1/2 to 1 inch long; the _rachis_ consists of five to eight flat joints\r\nbroadened at the top and ending in a cup, densely ciliate on both the\r\nmargins, but hairs on one margin are shorter than those on the other.\r\nEach joint bears a sessile and a pedicelled spikelet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151.--Andropogon pumilus.\r\n\r\n1.

This is an\r\nexcellent fodder grass. It forms fairly large tufts with plenty of green\r\nleaves on rich moist soils. When the leaves are young cattle eat this\r\ngrass very eagerly, but do not seem to care for it when the leaves\r\nbecome old. However by frequent grazing it can be made to produce young\r\nleaves in succession. This grass is also an excellent soil binder, as\r\nits roots form a perfect matting in any kind of moist soil soon after\r\nplanting. This is very difficult to eradicate when once established.\r\n\r\n_Distribution._--Throughout India and Burma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179.--Sporobolus tremulus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sporobolus tremulus, _Kunth._=\r\n\r\nA small tufted perennial grass.\r\n\r\nThe plant consists of prostrate stems and stolons, filiform and wiry.\r\nStems vary in length from 2 to 18 inches, prostrate or erect, rooting at\r\nthe lower nodes; flowering branches always ascending.\r\n\r\nThe _leaf-sheath_ is glabrous, finely striate, shorter than the\r\ninternode.

Grain as in _S. coromandelianus_.\r\n\r\nIn Flora of British India, this plant is included under Sporobolus\r\ncoromandelianus. These two plants (_S. coromandelianus_ and _S.\r\ncommutatus_) are quite distinct and grow side by side. As the\r\ndifferences are not easily seen in herbarium specimens the two plants\r\nare put together under the one species _S. coromandelianus_. The\r\nbranches are tufted and are usually decumbent at base, leaves quite\r\ngreen and somewhat broad in _S. coromandelianus_; and in _S.\r\ncommutatus_, branches are usually not decumbent at base, generally erect\r\nfrom the base and leaves are green glaucous and somewhat narrow. The\r\nmost striking difference, however, is in the panicle. The branches of\r\nthe panicle are always stiff and horizontal in S. coromandelianus and\r\nthe spikelets are appressed to the branches and never spreading or\r\ndrooping, whereas in _S. commutatus_ the branches are never stiff and\r\nhorizontal, always obliquely ascending and the spikelets are spreading\r\nand drooping. Judging from living plants these two are undoubtedly\r\ndistinct and so this plant is treated as a distinct species retaining\r\nKunth's name _Sporobolus commutatus_. Enumeratio Plantarum, Pl.

The _first glume_ is hyaline, purplish or pale, about 1/10\r\ninch long, lanceolate, sub-acuminate, 1-nerved with a scaberulous keel.\r\nThe _second glume_ is hyaline, about one and half times as long as the\r\nfirst, oblong elliptic, minutely 2-lobed at the apex, with a minute\r\nmucro between, 1-nerved with a scabrid keel. The _third glume_ is as\r\nlong as the second, awned, pale or purple, ovate or obovate, narrowed at\r\nthe base and clasping the rachilla at its base, apex shortly 2-fid with\r\na purple dorsal awn, 3-nerved paleate; the two marginal nerves are\r\ndensely bearded with long white or purple tinged hairs from near the\r\nbase to almost the apex and the mid-nerve also similarly bearded with\r\nlong hairs on both sides, and the base with a tuft of long hairs; the\r\npalea is as long as the glume, coriaceous obovately-cuneate, obtuse,\r\nminutely bifid, purple-tipped, with folded hyaline margins, 2-keeled;\r\nkeels shortly ciliate. _Stamens_ three with yellow or purple anthers,\r\n_ovary_ with two feathery _stigmas_ and two _lodicules_. Grain is oblong\r\nshining light reddish brown, narrowed at both ends and somewhat\r\ntrigonous. The remaining glumes _fourth_ to _seventh_ are borne by the\r\nrachilla, thinly chartaceous, broadly obcordate or obovate, gradually\r\ndiminishing in size, purple-tinged, 3- to 5-nerved, scaberulous. The\r\nfourth and fifth glumes are empty and epaleate when the spikelets are\r\nfive glumed. If there are six glumes, the _fourth_ bears stamens and the\r\novary, the _fifth_ and _sixth glumes_ are empty, and in spikelets of\r\nseven glumes, the third, fourth, and the fifth glumes are flower-bearing\r\nand contain grains, and the remaining two glumes are empty.\r\n\r\nThis species is a tall robust one resembling _Chloris barbata_ in its\r\ninflorescence, but with larger spikelets--as large as those of _Chloris\r\ntenella_. No doubt it is closely allied to _Chloris barbata_, but\r\ndiffers from it by having larger spikelets that are 3- to 5-awned and 1-\r\nto 3-flowered, and the nerves being bearded throughout their length with\r\nlong hairs.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this grass were sent to Kew and Calcutta herbariums for\r\nidentification and they were named _C. montana_, with which I could not\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nSo again I sent these specimens along with specimens of what I\r\nconsidered _C. montana_ to Dr. Stapf at Kew through Mr. Gamble and Dr.\r\nStapf wrote about these thus:--\"We have not been able to match it with\r\nany of the described species of _Chloris_ and Mr. Ranga Acharya will be\r\nfully justified in describing it as a new species.
