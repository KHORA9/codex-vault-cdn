It is here reproduced in a\r\ncorrected and, I hope, clearer form, with some additional facts.  The\r\nillustrations were drawn by my son, George Darwin.  Fritz Müller, after\r\nthe publication of my paper, sent to the Linnean Society (Journal, vol.\r\nix., p. 344) some interesting observations on the climbing plants of\r\nSouth Brazil, to which I shall frequently refer.  Recently two important\r\nmemoirs, chiefly on the difference in growth between the upper and lower\r\nsides of tendrils, and on the mechanism of the movements of\r\ntwining-plants, by Dr. Hugo de Vries, have appeared in the ‘Arbeiten des\r\nBotanischen Instituts in Würzburg,’ Heft. iii., 1873.  These memoirs\r\nought to be carefully studied by every one interested in the subject, as\r\nI can here give only references to the more important points.  This\r\nexcellent observer, as well as Professor Sachs, {iv} attributes all the\r\nmovements of tendrils to rapid growth along one side; but, from reasons\r\nassigned towards the close of my fourth chapter, I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat this holds good with respect to those due to a touch.  In order that\r\nthe reader may know what points have interested me most, I may call his\r\nattention to certain tendril-bearing plants; for instance, Bignonia\r\ncapreolata, Cobæa, Echinocystis, and Hanburya, which display as beautiful\r\nadaptations as can be found in any part of the kingdom of nature.  It is,\r\nalso, an interesting fact that intermediate states between organs fitted\r\nfor widely different functions, may be observed on the same individual\r\nplant of Corydalis claviculata and the common vine; and these cases\r\nillustrate in a striking manner the principle of the gradual evolution of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO PREFACE (1882).\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the publication of this Edition two papers by eminent botanists\r\nhave appeared; Schwendener, ‘Das Winden der Pflanzen’ (Monatsberichte der\r\nBerliner Akademie, Dec. 1881), and J. Sachs, ‘Notiz über Schlingpflanzen’\r\n(Arbeiten des botanischen Instituts in Würzburg, Bd. ii. p. 719, 1882).\r\nThe view “that the capacity of revolving, on which most climbers depend,\r\nis inherent, though undeveloped, in almost every plant in the vegetable\r\nkingdom” (‘Climbing Plants,’ p. 205), has been confirmed by the\r\nobservations on circumnutation since given in ‘The Power of Movement in\r\nPlants.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn pp. 28, 32, 40, 53, statements are made with reference to the supposed\r\nacceleration of the revolving movement towards the light.  It appears\r\nfrom the observations given in ‘The Power of Movement in Plants,’ p. 451,\r\nthat these conclusions were drawn from insufficient observations, and are\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENTS AND HABITS OF CLIMBING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTWINING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroductory remarks—Description of the twining of the Hop—Torsion of the\r\nstems—Nature of the revolving movement, and manner of ascent—Stems not\r\nirritable—Rate of revolution in various plants—Thickness of the support\r\nround which plants can twine—Species which revolve in an anomalous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nI WAS led to this subject by an interesting, but short paper by Professor\r\nAsa Gray on the movements of the tendrils of some Cucurbitaceous plants.\r\n{1a}  My observations were more than half completed before I learnt that\r\nthe surprising phenomenon of the spontaneous revolutions of the stems and\r\ntendrils of climbing plants had been long ago observed by Palm and by\r\nHugo von Mohl, {1b} and had subsequently been the subject of two memoirs\r\nby Dutrochet. {1c}  Nevertheless, I believe that my observations, founded\r\non the examination of above a hundred widely distinct living species,\r\ncontain sufficient novelty to justify me in publishing them.\r\n\r\nClimbing plants may be divided into four classes.  First, those which\r\ntwine spirally round a support, and are not aided by any other movement.\r\nSecondly, those endowed with irritable organs, which when they touch any\r\nobject clasp it; such organs consisting of modified leaves, branches, or\r\nflower-peduncles.  But these two classes sometimes graduate to a certain\r\nextent into one another.  Plants of the third class ascend merely by the\r\naid of hooks; and those of the fourth by rootlets; but as in neither\r\nclass do the plants exhibit any special movements, they present little\r\ninterest, and generally when I speak of climbing plants I refer to the\r\ntwo first great classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWINING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the largest subdivision, and is apparently the primordial and\r\nsimplest condition of the class.  My observations will be best given by\r\ntaking a few special cases.  When the shoot of a Hop (_Humulus lupulus_)\r\nrises from the ground, the two or three first-formed joints or internodes\r\nare straight and remain stationary; but the next-formed, whilst very\r\nyoung, may be seen to bend to one side and to travel slowly round towards\r\nall points of the compass, moving, like the hands of a watch, with the\r\nsun.  The movement very soon acquires its full ordinary velocity.  From\r\nseven observations made during August on shoots proceeding from a plant\r\nwhich had been cut down, and on another plant during April, the average\r\nrate during hot weather and during the day is 2 hrs. 8 m. for each\r\nrevolution; and none of the revolutions varied much from this rate.  The\r\nrevolving movement continues as long as the plant continues to grow; but\r\neach separate internode, as it becomes old, ceases to move.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain more precisely what amount of movement each internode\r\nunderwent, I kept a potted plant, during the night and day, in a\r\nwell-warmed room to which I was confined by illness.  A long shoot\r\nprojected beyond the upper end of the supporting stick, and was steadily\r\nrevolving.  I then took a longer stick and tied up the shoot, so that\r\nonly a very young internode, 1¾ of an inch in length, was left free.\r\nThis was so nearly upright that its revolution could not be easily\r\nobserved; but it certainly moved, and the side of the internode which was\r\nat one time convex became concave, which, as we shall hereafter see, is a\r\nsure sign of the revolving movement.  I will assume that it made at least\r\none revolution during the first twenty-four hours.  Early the next\r\nmorning its position was marked, and it made a second revolution in 9\r\nhrs.; during the latter part of this revolution it moved much quicker,\r\nand the third circle was performed in the evening in a little over 3 hrs.\r\nAs on the succeeding morning I found that the shoot revolved in 2 hrs. 45\r\nm., it must have made during the night four revolutions, each at the\r\naverage rate of a little over 3 hrs.  I should add that the temperature\r\nof the room varied only a little.  The shoot had now grown 3½ inches in\r\nlength, and carried at its extremity a young internode 1 inch in length,\r\nwhich showed slight changes in its curvature.  The next or ninth\r\nrevolution was effected in 2 hrs. 30 m.  From this time forward, the\r\nrevolutions were easily observed.  The thirty-sixth revolution was\r\nperformed at the usual rate; so was the last or thirty-seventh, but it\r\nwas not completed; for the internode suddenly became upright, and after\r\nmoving to the centre, remained motionless.  I tied a weight to its upper\r\nend, so as to bow it slightly and thus detect any movement; but there was\r\nnone.  Some time before the last revolution was half performed, the lower\r\npart of the internode ceased to move.\r\n\r\nA few more remarks will complete all that need be said about this\r\ninternode.  It moved during five days; but the more rapid movements,\r\nafter the performance of the third revolution, lasted during three days\r\nand twenty hours.  The regular revolutions, from the ninth to\r\nthirty-sixth inclusive, were effected at the average rate of 2 hrs. 31\r\nm.; but the weather was cold, and this affected the temperature of the\r\nroom, especially during the night, and consequently retarded the rate of\r\nmovement a little.  There was only one irregular movement, which\r\nconsisted in the stem rapidly making, after an unusually slow revolution,\r\nonly the segment of a circle.  After the seventeenth revolution the\r\ninternode had grown from 1¾ to 6 inches in length, and carried an\r\ninternode 1⅞ inch long, which was just perceptibly moving; and this\r\ncarried a very minute ultimate internode.  After the twenty-first\r\nrevolution, the penultimate internode was 2½ inches long, and probably\r\nrevolved in a period of about three hours.  At the twenty-seventh\r\nrevolution the lower and still moving internode was 8⅜, the penultimate\r\n3½, and the ultimate 2½ inches in length; and the inclination of the\r\nwhole shoot was such, that a circle 19 inches in diameter was swept by\r\nit.  When the movement ceased, the lower internode was 9 inches, and the\r\npenultimate 6 inches in length; so that, from the twenty-seventh to\r\nthirty-seventh revolutions inclusive, three internodes were at the same\r\ntime revolving.\r\n\r\nThe lower internode, when it ceased revolving, became upright and rigid;\r\nbut as the whole shoot was left to grow unsupported, it became after a\r\ntime bent into a nearly horizontal position, the uppermost and growing\r\ninternodes still revolving at the extremity, but of course no longer\r\nround the old central point of the supporting stick.  From the changed\r\nposition of the centre of gravity of the extremity, as it revolved, a\r\nslight and slow swaying movement was given to the long horizontally\r\nprojecting shoot; and this movement I at first thought was a spontaneous\r\none.  As the shoot grew, it hung down more and more, whilst the growing\r\nand revolving extremity turned itself up more and more.\r\n\r\nWith the Hop we have seen that three internodes were at the same time\r\nrevolving; and this was the case with most of the plants observed by me.\r\nWith all, if in full health, two internodes revolved; so that by the time\r\nthe lower one ceased to revolve, the one above was in full action, with a\r\nterminal internode just commencing to move.  With _Hoya carnosa_, on the\r\nother hand, a depending shoot, without any developed leaves, 32 inches in\r\nlength, and consisting of seven internodes (a minute terminal one, an\r\ninch in length, being counted), continually, but slowly, swayed from side\r\nto side in a semicircular course, with the extreme internodes making\r\ncomplete revolutions.  This swaying movement was certainly due to the\r\nmovement of the lower internodes, which, however, had not force\r\nsufficient to swing the whole shoot round the central supporting stick.\r\nThe case of another Asclepiadaceous plant, viz., _Ceropegia Gardnerii_,\r\nis worth briefly giving.  I allowed the top to grow out almost\r\nhorizontally to the length of 31 inches; this now consisted of three long\r\ninternodes, terminated by two short ones.  The whole revolved in a course\r\nopposed to the sun (the reverse of that of the Hop), at rates between 5\r\nhrs. 15 m. and 6 hrs. 45 m. for each revolution.  The extreme tip thus\r\nmade a circle of above 5 feet (or 62 inches) in diameter and 16 feet in\r\ncircumference, travelling at the rate of 32 or 33 inches per hour.  The\r\nweather being hot, the plant was allowed to stand on my study-table; and\r\nit was an interesting spectacle to watch the long shoot sweeping this\r\ngrand circle, night and day, in search of some object round which to\r\ntwine.\r\n\r\nIf we take hold of a growing sapling, we can of course bend it to all\r\nsides in succession, so as to make the tip describe a circle, like that\r\nperformed by the summit of a spontaneously revolving plant.  By this\r\nmovement the sapling is not in the least twisted round its own axis.  I\r\nmention this because if a black point be painted on the bark, on the side\r\nwhich is uppermost when the sapling is bent towards the holder’s body, as\r\nthe circle is described, the black point gradually turns round and sinks\r\nto the lower side, and comes up again when the circle is completed; and\r\nthis gives the false appearance of twisting, which, in the case of\r\nspontaneously revolving plants, deceived me for a time.  The appearance\r\nis the more deceitful because the axes of nearly all twining-plants are\r\nreally twisted; and they are twisted in the same direction with the\r\nspontaneous revolving movement.  To give an instance, the internode of\r\nthe Hop of which the history has been recorded, was at first, as could be\r\nseen by the ridges on its surface, not in the least twisted; but when,\r\nafter the 37th revolution, it had grown 9 inches long, and its revolving\r\nmovement had ceased, it had become twisted three times round its own\r\naxis, in the line of the course of the sun; on the other hand, the common\r\nConvolvulus, which revolves in an opposite course to the Hop, becomes\r\ntwisted in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nHence it is not surprising that Hugo von Mohl (p. 105, 108, &c.) thought\r\nthat the twisting of the axis caused the revolving movement; but it is\r\nnot possible that the twisting of the axis of the Hop three times should\r\nhave caused thirty-seven revolutions.  Moreover, the revolving movement\r\ncommenced in the young internode before any twisting of its axis could be\r\ndetected.  The internodes of a young Siphomeris and Lecontea revolved\r\nduring several days, but became twisted only once round their own axes.\r\nThe best evidence, however, that the twisting does not cause the\r\nrevolving movement is afforded by many leaf-climbing and tendril-bearing\r\nplants (as _Pisum sativum_, _Echinocystis lobata_, _Bignonia capreolata_,\r\n_Eccremocarpus scaber_, and with the leaf-climbers, _Solanum jasminoides_\r\nand various species of _Clematis_), of which the internodes are not\r\ntwisted, but which, as we shall hereafter see, regularly perform\r\nrevolving movements like those of true twining-plants.  Moreover,\r\naccording to Palm (pp. 30, 95) and Mohl (p. 149), and Léon, {8}\r\ninternodes may occasionally, and even not very rarely, be found which are\r\ntwisted in an opposite direction to the other internodes on the same\r\nplant, and to the course of their revolutions; and this, according to\r\nLéon (p. 356), is the case with all the internodes of a certain variety\r\nof _Phaseolus multiflorus_.  Internodes which have become twisted round\r\ntheir own axes, if they have not ceased to revolve, are still capable of\r\ntwining round a support, as I have several times observed.\r\n\r\nMohl has remarked (p. 111) that when a stem twines round a smooth\r\ncylindrical stick, it does not become twisted. {9a}  Accordingly I\r\nallowed kidney-beans to run up stretched string, and up smooth rods of\r\niron and glass, one-third of an inch in diameter, and they became twisted\r\nonly in that degree which follows as a mechanical necessity from the\r\nspiral winding.  The stems, on the other hand, which had ascended\r\nordinary rough sticks were all more or less and generally much twisted.\r\nThe influence of the roughness of the support in causing axial twisting\r\nwas well seen in the stems which had twined up the glass rods; for these\r\nrods were fixed into split sticks below, and were secured above to cross\r\nsticks, and the stems in passing these places became much twisted.  As\r\nsoon as the stems which had ascended the iron rods reached the summit and\r\nbecame free, they also became twisted; and this apparently occurred more\r\nquickly during windy than during calm weather.  Several other facts could\r\nbe given, showing that the axial twisting stands in some relation to\r\ninequalities in the support, and likewise to the shoot revolving freely\r\nwithout any support.  Many plants, which are not twiners, become in some\r\ndegree twisted round their own axes; {9b} but this occurs so much more\r\ngenerally and strongly with twining-plants than with other plants, that\r\nthere must be some connexion between the capacity for twining and axial\r\ntwisting.  The stem probably gains rigidity by being twisted (on the same\r\nprinciple that a much twisted rope is stiffer than a slackly twisted\r\none), and is thus indirectly benefited so as to be enabled to pass over\r\ninequalities in its spiral ascent, and to carry its own weight when\r\nallowed to revolve freely. {10}\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the twisting which necessarily follows on mechanical\r\nprinciples from the spiral ascent of a stem, namely, one twist for each\r\nspire completed.  This was well shown by painting straight lines on\r\nliving stems, and then allowing them to twine; but, as I shall have to\r\nrecur to this subject under Tendrils, it may be here passed over.\r\n\r\nThe revolving movement of a twining plant has been compared with that of\r\nthe tip of a sapling, moved round and round by the hand held some way\r\ndown the stem; but there is one important difference.  The upper part of\r\nthe sapling when thus moved remains straight; but with twining plants\r\nevery part of the revolving shoot has its own separate and independent\r\nmovement.  This is easily proved; for when the lower half or two-thirds\r\nof a long revolving shoot is tied to a stick, the upper free part\r\ncontinues steadily revolving.  Even if the whole shoot, except an inch or\r\ntwo of the extremity, be tied up, this part, as I have seen in the case\r\nof the Hop, Ceropegia, Convolvulus, &c., goes on revolving, but much more\r\nslowly; for the internodes, until they have grown to some little length,\r\nalways move slowly.  If we look to the one, two, or several internodes of\r\na revolving shoot, they will be all seen to be more or less bowed, either\r\nduring the whole or during a large part of each revolution.  Now if a\r\ncoloured streak be painted (this was done with a large number of twining\r\nplants) along, we will say, the convex surface, the streak will after a\r\ntime (depending on the rate of revolution) be found to be running\r\nlaterally along one side of the bow, then along the concave side, then\r\nlaterally on the opposite side, and, lastly, again on the originally\r\nconvex surface.  This clearly proves that during the revolving movement\r\nthe internodes become bowed in every direction.  The movement is, in\r\nfact, a continuous self-bowing of the whole shoot, successively directed\r\nto all points of the compass; and has been well designated by Sachs as a\r\nrevolving nutation.\r\n\r\nAs this movement is rather difficult to understand, it will be well to\r\ngive an illustration.  Take a sapling and bend it to the south, and paint\r\na black line on the convex surface; let the sapling spring up and bend it\r\nto the east, and the black line will be seen to run along the lateral\r\nface fronting the north; bend it to the north, the black line will be on\r\nthe concave surface; bend it to the west, the line will again be on the\r\nlateral face; and when again bent to the south, the line will be on the\r\noriginal convex surface.  Now, instead of bending the sapling, let us\r\nsuppose that the cells along its northern surface from the base to the\r\ntip were to grow much more rapidly than on the three other sides, the\r\nwhole shoot would then necessarily be bowed to the south; and let the\r\nlongitudinal growing surface creep round the shoot, deserting by slow\r\ndegrees the northern side and encroaching on the western side, and so\r\nround by the south, by the east, again to the north.  In this case the\r\nshoot would remain always bowed with the painted line appearing on the\r\nseveral above specified surfaces, and with the point of the shoot\r\nsuccessively directed to each point of the compass.  In fact, we should\r\nhave the exact kind of movement performed by the revolving shoots of\r\ntwining plants. {12}\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the revolving movement is as regular as that\r\ngiven in the above illustration; in very many cases the tip describes an\r\nellipse, even a very narrow ellipse.  To recur once again to our\r\nillustration, if we suppose only the northern and southern surfaces of\r\nthe sapling alternately to grow rapidly, the summit would describe a\r\nsimple arc; if the growth first travelled a very little to the western\r\nface, and during the return a very little to the eastern face, a narrow\r\nellipse would be described; and the sapling would be straight as it\r\npassed to and fro through the intermediate space; and a complete\r\nstraightening of the shoot may often be observed in revolving plants.\r\nThe movement is frequently such that three of the sides of the shoot seem\r\nto be growing in due order more rapidly than the remaining side; so that\r\na semi-circle instead of a circle is described, the shoot becoming\r\nstraight and upright during half of its course.\r\n\r\nWhen a revolving shoot consists of several internodes, the lower ones\r\nbend together at the same rate, but one or two of the terminal ones bend\r\nat a slower rate; hence, though at times all the internodes are in the\r\nsame direction, at other times the shoot is rendered slightly serpentine.\r\nThe rate of revolution of the whole shoot, if judged by the movement of\r\nthe extreme tip, is thus at times accelerated or retarded.  One other\r\npoint must be noticed.  Authors have observed that the end of the shoot\r\nin many twining plants is completely hooked; this is very general, for\r\ninstance, with the Asclepiadaceæ.  The hooked tip, in all the cases\r\nobserved by me, viz. in _Ceropegia_, _Sphærostemma_, _Clerodendron_,\r\n_Wistaria_, _Stephania_, _Akebia_, and _Siphomeris_, has exactly the same\r\nkind of movement as the other internodes; for a line painted on the\r\nconvex surface first becomes lateral and then concave; but, owing to the\r\nyouth of these terminal internodes, the reversal of the hook is a slower\r\nprocess than that of the revolving movement. {14}  This strongly marked\r\ntendency in the young, terminal and flexible internodes, to bend in a\r\ngreater degree or more abruptly than the other internodes, is of service\r\nto the plant; for not only does the hook thus formed sometimes serve to\r\ncatch a support, but (and this seems to be much more important) it causes\r\nthe extremity of the shoot to embrace the support much more closely than\r\nit could otherwise have done, and thus aids in preventing the stem from\r\nbeing blown away during windy weather, as I have many times observed.  In\r\n_Lonicera brachypoda_ the hook only straightens itself periodically, and\r\nnever becomes reversed.  I will not assert that the tips of all twining\r\nplants when hooked, either reverse themselves or become periodically\r\nstraight, in the manner just described; for the hooked form may in some\r\ncases be permanent, and be due to the manner of growth of the species, as\r\nwith the tips of the shoots of the common vine, and more plainly with\r\nthose of _Cissus discolor_—plants which are not spiral twiners.\r\n\r\nThe first purpose of the spontaneous revolving movement, or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, of the continuous bowing movement directed\r\nsuccessively to all points of the compass, is, as Mohl has remarked, to\r\nfavour the shoot finding a support.  This is admirably effected by the\r\nrevolutions carried on night and day, a wider and wider circle being\r\nswept as the shoot increases in length.  This movement likewise explains\r\nhow the plants twine; for when a revolving shoot meets with a support,\r\nits motion is necessarily arrested at the point of contact, but the free\r\nprojecting part goes on revolving.  As this continues, higher and higher\r\npoints are brought into contact with the support and are arrested; and so\r\nonwards to the extremity; and thus the shoot winds round its support.\r\nWhen the shoot follows the sun in its revolving course, it winds round\r\nthe support from right to left, the support being supposed to stand in\r\nfront of the beholder; when the shoot revolves in an opposite direction,\r\nthe line of winding is reversed.  As each internode loses from age its\r\npower of revolving, it likewise loses its power of spirally twining.  If\r\na man swings a rope round his head, and the end hits a stick, it will\r\ncoil round the stick according to the direction of the swinging movement;\r\nso it is with a twining plant, a line of growth travelling round the free\r\npart of the shoot causing it to bend towards the opposite side, and this\r\nreplaces the momentum of the free end of the rope.\r\n\r\nAll the authors, except Palm and Mohl, who have discussed the spiral\r\ntwining of plants, maintain that such plants have a natural tendency to\r\ngrow spirally.  Mohl believes (p. 112) that twining stems have a dull\r\nkind of irritability, so that they bend towards any object which they\r\ntouch; but this is denied by Palm.  Even before reading Mohl’s\r\ninteresting treatise, this view seemed to me so probable that I tested it\r\nin every way that I could, but always with a negative result.  I rubbed\r\nmany shoots much harder than is necessary to excite movement in any\r\ntendril or in the foot-stalk of any leaf climber, but without any effect.\r\nI then tied a light forked twig to a shoot of a Hop, a _Ceropegia_,\r\n_Sphærostemma_, and _Adhatoda_, so that the fork pressed on one side\r\nalone of the shoot and revolved with it; I purposely selected some very\r\nslow revolvers, as it seemed most likely that these would profit most\r\nfrom possessing irritability; but in no case was any effect produced.\r\n{16}  Moreover, when a shoot winds round a support, the winding movement\r\nis always slower, as we shall immediately see, than whilst it revolves\r\nfreely and touches nothing.  Hence I conclude that twining stems are not\r\nirritable; and indeed it is not probable that they should be so, as\r\nnature always economizes her means, and irritability would have been\r\nsuperfluous.  Nevertheless I do not wish to assert that they are never\r\nirritable; for the growing axis of the leaf-climbing, but not spirally\r\ntwining, _Lophospermum scandens_ is, certainly irritable; but this case\r\ngives me confidence that ordinary twiners do not possess any such\r\nquality, for directly after putting a stick to the _Lophopermum_, I saw\r\nthat it behaved differently from a true twiner or any other leaf-climber.\r\n{17}\r\n\r\nThe belief that twiners have a natural tendency to grow spirally,\r\nprobably arose from their assuming a spiral form when wound round a\r\nsupport, and from the extremity, even whilst remaining free, sometimes\r\nassuming this form.  The free internodes of vigorously growing plants,\r\nwhen they cease to revolve, become straight, and show no tendency to be\r\nspiral; but when a shoot has nearly ceased to grow, or when the plant is\r\nunhealthy, the extremity does occasionally become spiral.  I have seen\r\nthis in a remarkable manner with the ends of the shoots of the\r\n_Stauntonia_ and of the allied _Akebia_, which became wound up into a\r\nclose spire, just like a tendril; and this was apt to occur after some\r\nsmall, ill-formed leaves had perished.  The explanation, I believe, is,\r\nthat in such cases the lower parts of the terminal internodes very\r\ngradually and successively lose their power of movement, whilst the\r\nportions just above move onwards and in their turn become motionless; and\r\nthis ends in forming an irregular spire.\r\n\r\nWhen a revolving shoot strikes a stick, it winds round it rather more\r\nslowly than it revolves.  For instance, a shoot of the _Ceropegia_,\r\nrevolved in 6 hrs., but took 9 hrs. 30 m. to make one complete spire\r\nround a stick; _Aristolochia gigas_ revolved in about 5 hrs., but took 9\r\nhrs. 15 m. to complete its spire.  This, I presume, is due to the\r\ncontinued disturbance of the impelling force by the arrestment of the\r\nmovement at successive points; and we shall hereafter see that even\r\nshaking a plant retards the revolving movement.  The terminal internodes\r\nof a long, much-inclined, revolving shoot of the _Ceropegia_, after they\r\nhad wound round a stick, always slipped up it, so as to render the spire\r\nmore open than it was at first; and this was probably in part due to the\r\nforce which caused the revolutions, being now almost freed from the\r\nconstraint of gravity and allowed to act freely.  With the _Wistaria_, on\r\nthe other hand, a long horizontal shoot wound itself at first into a very\r\nclose spire, which remained unchanged; but subsequently, as the shoot\r\ntwined spirally up its support, it made a much more open spire.  With all\r\nthe many plants which were allowed freely to ascend a support, the\r\nterminal internodes made at first a close spire; and this, during windy\r\nweather, served to keep the shoots in close contact with their support;\r\nbut as the penultimate internodes grew in length, they pushed themselves\r\nup for a considerable space (ascertained by coloured marks on the shoot\r\nand on the support) round the stick, and the spire became more open. {18}\r\n\r\nIt follows from this latter fact that the position occupied by each leaf\r\nwith respect to the support depends on the growth of the internodes after\r\nthey have become spirally wound round it.  I mention this on account of\r\nan observation by Palm (p. 34), who states that the opposite leaves of\r\nthe Hop always stand in a row, exactly over one another, on the same side\r\nof the supporting stick, whatever its thickness may be.  My sons visited\r\na hop-field for me, and reported that though they generally found the\r\npoints of insertion of the leaves standing over each other for a space of\r\ntwo or three feet in height, yet this never occurred up the whole length\r\nof the pole; the points of insertion forming, as might have been\r\nexpected, an irregular spire.  Any irregularity in the pole entirely\r\ndestroyed the regularity of position of the leaves.  From casual\r\ninspection, it appeared to me that the opposite leaves of _Thunbergia\r\nalata_ were arranged in lines up the sticks round which they had twined;\r\naccordingly, I raised a dozen plants, and gave them sticks of various\r\nthicknesses, as well as string, to twine round; and in this case one\r\nalone out of the dozen had its leaves arranged in a perpendicular line: I\r\nconclude, therefore, Palm’s statement is not quite accurate.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of different twining-plants are arranged on the stem (before\r\nit has twined) alternately, or oppositely, or in a spire.  In the latter\r\ncase the line of insertion of the leaves and the course of the\r\nrevolutions coincide.  This fact has been well shown by Dutrochet, {19}\r\nwho found different individuals of _Solanum dulcamara_ twining in\r\nopposite directions, and these had their leaves in each case spirally\r\narranged in the same direction.  A dense whorl of many leaves would\r\napparently be incommodious for a twining plant, and some authors assert\r\nthat none have their leaves thus arranged; but a twining _Siphomeris_ has\r\nwhorls of three leaves.\r\n\r\nIf a stick which has arrested a revolving shoot, but has not as yet been\r\nencircled, be suddenly taken away, the shoot generally springs forward,\r\nshowing that it was pressing with some force against the stick.  After a\r\nshoot has wound round a stick, if this be withdrawn, it retains for a\r\ntime its spiral form; it then straightens itself, and again commences to\r\nrevolve.  The long, much-inclined shoot of the _Ceropegia_ previously\r\nalluded to offered some curious peculiarities.  The lower and older\r\ninternodes, which continued to revolve, were incapable, on repeated\r\ntrials, of twining round a thin stick; showing that, although the power\r\nof movement was retained, this was not sufficient to enable the plant to\r\ntwine.  I then moved the stick to a greater distance, so that it was\r\nstruck by a point 2½ inches from the extremity of the penultimate\r\ninternode; and it was then neatly encircled by this part of the\r\npenultimate and by the ultimate internode.  After leaving the spirally\r\nwound shoot for eleven hours, I quietly withdrew the stick, and in the\r\ncourse of the day the curled portion straightened itself and recommenced\r\nrevolving; but the lower and not curled portion of the penultimate\r\ninternode did not move, a sort of hinge separating the moving and the\r\nmotionless part of the same internode.  After a few days, however, I\r\nfound that this lower part had likewise recovered its revolving power.\r\nThese several facts show that the power of movement is not immediately\r\nlost in the arrested portion of a revolving shoot; and that after being\r\ntemporarily lost it can be recovered.  When a shoot has remained for a\r\nconsiderable time round a support, it permanently retains its spiral form\r\neven when the support is removed.\r\n\r\nWhen a tall stick was placed so as to arrest the lower and rigid\r\ninternodes of the _Ceropegia_, at the distance at first of 15 and then of\r\n21 inches from the centre of revolution, the straight shoot slowly and\r\ngradually slid up the stick, so as to become more and more highly\r\ninclined, but did not pass over the summit.  Then, after an interval\r\nsufficient to have allowed of a semi-revolution, the shoot suddenly\r\nbounded from the stick and fell over to the opposite side or point of the\r\ncompass, and reassumed its previous slight inclination.  It now\r\nrecommenced revolving in its usual course, so that after a\r\nsemi-revolution it again came into contact with the stick, again slid up\r\nit, and again bounded from it and fell over to the opposite side.  This\r\nmovement of the shoot had a very odd appearance, as if it were disgusted\r\nwith its failure but was resolved to try again.  We shall, I think,\r\nunderstand this movement by considering the former illustration of the\r\nsapling, in which the growing surface was supposed to creep round from\r\nthe northern by the western to the southern face; and thence back again\r\nby the eastern to the northern face, successively bowing the sapling in\r\nall directions.  Now with the _Ceropegia_, the stick being placed to the\r\nsouth of the shoot and in contact with it, as soon as the circulatory\r\ngrowth reached the western surface, no effect would be produced, except\r\nthat the shoot would be pressed firmly against the stick.  But as soon as\r\ngrowth on the southern surface began, the shoot would be slowly dragged\r\nwith a sliding movement up the stick; and then, as soon as the eastern\r\ngrowth commenced, the shoot would be drawn from the stick, and its weight\r\ncoinciding with the effects of the changed surface of growth, would cause\r\nit suddenly to fall to the opposite side, reassuming its previous slight\r\ninclination; and the ordinary revolving movement would then go on as\r\nbefore.  I have described this curious case with some care, because it\r\nfirst led me to understand the order in which, as I then thought, the\r\nsurfaces contracted; but in which, as we now know from Sachs and II. de\r\nVries, they grow for a time rapidly, thus causing the shoot to bow\r\ntowards the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe view just given further explains, as I believe, a fact observed by\r\nMohl (p. 135), namely, that a revolving shoot, though it will twine round\r\nan object as thin as a thread, cannot do so round a thick support.  I\r\nplaced some long revolving shoots of a _Wistaria_ close to a post between\r\n5 and 6 inches in diameter, but, though aided by me in many ways, they\r\ncould not wind round it.  This apparently was due to the flexure of the\r\nshoot, whilst winding round an object so gently curved as this post, not\r\nbeing sufficient to hold the shoot to its place when the growing surface\r\ncrept round to the opposite surface of the shoot; so that it was\r\nwithdrawn at each revolution from its support.\r\n\r\nWhen a free shoot has grown far beyond its support, it sinks downwards\r\nfrom its weight, as already explained in the case of the Hop, with the\r\nrevolving extremity turned upwards.  If the support be not lofty, the\r\nshoot falls to the ground, and resting there, the extremity rises up.\r\nSometimes several shoots, when flexible, twine together into a cable, and\r\nthus support one another.  Single thin depending shoots, such as those of\r\nthe _Sollya Drummondii_, will turn abruptly backwards and wind up on\r\nthemselves.  The greater number of the depending shoots, however, of one\r\ntwining plant, the _Hibbertia dentata_, showed but little tendency to\r\nturn upwards.  In other cases, as with the _Cryptostegia grandiflora_,\r\nseveral internodes which were at first flexible and revolved, if they did\r\nnot succeed in twining round a support, become quite rigid, and\r\nsupporting themselves upright, carried on their summits the younger\r\nrevolving internodes.\r\n\r\nHere will be a convenient place to give a Table showing the direction and\r\nrate of movement of several twining plants, with a few appended remarks.\r\nThese plants are arranged according to Lindley’s ‘Vegetable Kingdom’ of\r\n1853; and they have been selected from all parts of the series so as to\r\nshow that all kinds behave in a nearly uniform manner. {24}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rate of Revolution of various Twining Plants.\r\n\r\n(ACOTYLEDONS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lygodium scandens_ (Polypodiaceæ) moves against the sun.\r\n\r\n                                      H.

As long as a plant remains under the same conditions, the\r\nrate is often remarkably uniform, as with the Hop, _Mikania_,\r\n_Phaseolus_, &c.  The Scyphanthus made one revolution in 1 hr. 17 m., and\r\nthis is the quickest rate observed by me; but we shall hereafter see a\r\ntendril-bearing Passiflora revolving more rapidly.  A shoot of the\r\n_Akebia quinata_ made a revolution in 1 hr. 30 m., and three revolutions\r\nat the average rate of 1 hr. 38 m.; a Convolvulus made two revolutions at\r\nthe average of 1 hr. 42 m., and _Phaseolus vulgaris_ three at the average\r\nof 1 hr. 57 m.  On the other hand, some plants take 24 hrs. for a single\r\nrevolution, and the _Adhadota_ sometimes required 48 hrs.; yet this\r\nlatter plant is an efficient twiner.  Species of the same genus move at\r\ndifferent rates.  The rate does not seem governed by the thickness of the\r\nshoots: those of the _Sollya_ are as thin and flexible as string, but\r\nmove more slowly than the thick and fleshy shoots of the _Ruscus_, which\r\nseem little fitted for movement of any kind.  The shoots of the\r\n_Wistaria_, which become woody, move faster than those of the herbaceous\r\n_Ipomoea_ or _Thunbergia_.\r\n\r\nWe know that the internodes, whilst still very young, do not acquire\r\ntheir proper rate of movement; hence the several shoots on the same plant\r\nmay sometimes be seen revolving at different rates.  The two or three, or\r\neven more, internodes which are first formed above the cotyledons, or\r\nabove the root-stock of a perennial plant, do not move; they can support\r\nthemselves, and nothing superfluous is granted.\r\n\r\nA greater number of twiners revolve in a course opposed to that of the\r\nsun, or to the hands of a watch, than in the reversed course, and,\r\nconsequently, the majority, as is well known, ascend their supports from\r\nleft to right.  Occasionally, though rarely, plants of the same order\r\ntwine in opposite directions, of which Mohl (p. 125) gives a case in the\r\nLeguminosæ, and we have in the table another in the Acanthaceæ.  I have\r\nseen no instance of two species of the same genus twining in opposite\r\ndirections, and such cases must be rare; but Fritz Müller {33} states\r\nthat although _Mikania scandens_ twines, as I have described, from left\r\nto right, another species in South Brazil twines in an opposite\r\ndirection.  It would have been an anomalous circumstance if no such cases\r\nhad occurred, for different individuals of the same species, namely, of\r\n_Solanum dulcamara_ (Dutrochet, tom. xix. p. 299), revolve and twine in\r\ntwo directions: this plant, however; is a most feeble twiner.  _Loasa\r\naurantiaca_ (Léon, p. 351) offers a much more curious case: I raised\r\nseventeen plants: of these eight revolved in opposition to the sun and\r\nascended from left to right; five followed the sun and ascended from\r\nright to left; and four revolved and twined first in one direction, and\r\nthen reversed their course, {34} the petioles of the opposite leaves\r\naffording a _point d’appui_ for the reversal of the spire.  One of these\r\nfour plants made seven spiral turns from right to left, and five turns\r\nfrom left to right.  Another plant in the same family, the _Scyphanthus\r\nelegans_, habitually twines in this same manner.  I raised many plants of\r\nit, and the stems of all took one turn, or occasionally two or even three\r\nturns in one direction, and then, ascending for a short space straight,\r\nreversed their course and took one or two turns in an opposite direction.\r\nThe reversal of the curvature occurred at any point in the stem, even in\r\nthe middle of an internode.  Had I not seen this case, I should have\r\nthought its occurrence most improbable.  It would be hardly possible with\r\nany plant which ascended above a few feet in height, or which lived in an\r\nexposed situation; for the stem could be pulled away easily from its\r\nsupport, with but little unwinding; nor could it have adhered at all, had\r\nnot the internodes soon become moderately rigid.  With leaf-climbers, as\r\nwe shall soon see, analogous cases frequently occur; but these present no\r\ndifficulty, as the stem is secured by the clasping petioles.\r\n\r\nIn the many other revolving and twining plants observed by me, I never\r\nbut twice saw the movement reversed; once, and only for a short space, in\r\n_Ipomoea jucunda_; but frequently with _Hibbertia dentata_.  This plant\r\nat first perplexed me much, for I continually observed its long and\r\nflexible shoots, evidently well fitted for twining, make a whole, or\r\nhalf, or quarter circle in one direction and then in an opposite\r\ndirection; consequently, when I placed the shoots near thin or thick\r\nsticks, or perpendicularly stretched string, they seemed as if constantly\r\ntrying to ascend, but always failed.  I then surrounded the plant with a\r\nmass of branched twigs; the shoots ascended, and passed through them, but\r\nseveral came out laterally, and their depending extremities seldom turned\r\nupwards as is usual with twining plants.  Finally, I surrounded a second\r\nplant with many thin upright sticks, and placed it near the first one\r\nwith twigs; and now both had got what they liked, for they twined up the\r\nparallel sticks, sometimes winding round one and sometimes round several;\r\nand the shoots travelled laterally from one to the other pot; but as the\r\nplants grew older, some of the shoots twined regularly up thin upright\r\nsticks.  Though the revolving movement was sometimes in one direction and\r\nsometimes in the other, the twining was invariably from left to right;\r\n{36} so that the more potent or persistent movement of revolution must\r\nhave been in opposition to the course of the sun.  It would appear that\r\nthis _Hibbertia_ is adapted both to ascend by twining, and to ramble\r\nlaterally through the thick Australian scrub.\r\n\r\nI have described the above case in some detail, because, as far as I have\r\nseen, it is rare to find any special adaptations with twining plants, in\r\nwhich respect they differ much from the more highly organized\r\ntendril-bearers.  The _Solanum dulcamara_, as we shall presently see, can\r\ntwine only round stems which are both thin and flexible.  Most twining\r\nplants are adapted to ascend supports of moderate though of different\r\nthicknesses.  Our English twiners, as far as I have seen, never twine\r\nround trees, excepting the honeysuckle (_Lonicera periclymenum_), which I\r\nhave observed twining up a young beech-tree nearly 4½ inches in diameter.\r\nMohl (p. 134) found that the _Phaseolus multiflorus_ and _Ipomoea\r\npurpurea_ could not, when placed in a room with the light entering on one\r\nside, twine round sticks between 3 and 4 inches in diameter; for this\r\ninterfered, in a manner presently to be explained, with the revolving\r\nmovement.  In the open air, however, the _Phaseolus_ twined round a\r\nsupport of the above thickness, but failed in twining round one 9 inches\r\nin diameter.  Nevertheless, some twiners of the warmer temperate regions\r\ncan manage this latter degree of thickness; for I hear from Dr. Hooker\r\nthat at Kew the _Ruscus androgynus_ has ascended a column 9 inches in\r\ndiameter; and although a _Wistaria_ grown by me in a small pot tried in\r\nvain for weeks to get round a post between 5 and 6 inches in thickness,\r\nyet at Kew a plant ascended a trunk above 6 inches in diameter.  The\r\ntropical twiners, on the other hand, can ascend thicker trees; I hear\r\nfrom Drs. Thomson and Hooker that this is the case with the _Butea\r\nparviflora_, one of the Menispermaceæ, and with some Dalbergias and other\r\nLeguminosæ. {37}  This power would be necessary for any species which had\r\nto ascend by twining the large trees of a tropical forest; otherwise they\r\nwould hardly ever be able to reach the light.  In our temperate countries\r\nit would be injurious to the twining plants which die down every year if\r\nthey were enabled to twine round trunks of trees, for they could not grow\r\ntall enough in a single season to reach the summit and gain the light.\r\n\r\nBy what means certain twining plants are adapted to ascend only thin\r\nstems, whilst others can twine round thicker ones, I do not know.  It\r\nappeared to me probable that twining plants with very long revolving\r\nshoots would be able to ascend thick supports; accordingly I placed\r\n_Ceropegia Gardnerii_ near a post 6 inches in diameter, but the shoots\r\nentirely failed to wind round it; their great length and power of\r\nmovement merely aid them in finding a distant stem round which to twine.\r\nThe _Sphærostemma marmoratum_ is a vigorous tropical twiner; and as it is\r\na very slow revolver, I thought that this latter circumstance might help\r\nit in ascending a thick support; but though it was able to wind round a\r\n6-inch post, it could do this only on the same level or plane, and did\r\nnot form a spire and thus ascend.\r\n\r\nAs ferns differ so much in structure from phanerogamic plants, it may be\r\nworth while here to show that twining ferns do not differ in their habits\r\nfrom other twining plants.  In _Lygodium articulatum_ the two internodes\r\nof the stem (properly the rachis) which are first formed above the\r\nroot-stock do not move; the third from the ground revolves, but at first\r\nvery slowly.  This species is a slow revolver: but _L. scandens_ made\r\nfive revolutions, each at the average rate of 5 hrs. 45 m.; and this\r\nrepresents fairly well the usual rate, taking quick and slow movers,\r\namongst phanerogamic plants.  The rate was accelerated by increased\r\ntemperature.  At each stage of growth only the two upper internodes\r\nrevolved.  A line painted along the convex surface of a revolving\r\ninternode becomes first lateral, then concave, then lateral and\r\nultimately again convex.  Neither the internodes nor the petioles are\r\nirritable when rubbed.  The movement is in the usual direction, namely,\r\nin opposition to the course of the sun; and when the stem twines round a\r\nthin stick, it becomes twisted on its own axis in the same direction.\r\nAfter the young internodes have twined round a stick, their continued\r\ngrowth causes them to slip a little upwards.  If the stick be soon\r\nremoved, they straighten themselves, and recommence revolving.  The\r\nextremities of the depending shoots turn upwards, and twine on\r\nthemselves.  In all these respects we have complete identity with twining\r\nphanerogamic plants; and the above enumeration may serve as a summary of\r\nthe leading characteristics of all twining plants.\r\n\r\nThe power of revolving depends on the general health and vigour of the\r\nplant, as has been laboriously shown by Palm.  But the movement of each\r\nseparate internode is so independent of the others, that cutting off an\r\nupper one does not affect the revolutions of a lower one.  When, however,\r\nDutrochet cut off two whole shoots of the Hop, and placed them in water,\r\nthe movement was greatly retarded; for one revolved in 20 hrs. and the\r\nother in 23 hrs., whereas they ought to have revolved in between 2 hrs.\r\nand 2 hrs. 30 m.  Shoots of the Kidney-bean, cut off and placed in water,\r\nwere similarly retarded, but in a less degree.  I have repeatedly\r\nobserved that carrying a plant from the greenhouse to my room, or from\r\none part to another of the greenhouse, always stopped the movement for a\r\ntime; hence I conclude that plants in a state of nature and growing in\r\nexposed situations, would not make their revolutions during very stormy\r\nweather.  A decrease in temperature always caused a considerable\r\nretardation in the rate of revolution; but Dutrochet (tom. xvii. pp. 994,\r\n996) has given such precise observations on this head with respect to the\r\ncommon pea that I need say nothing more.  When twining plants are placed\r\nnear a window in a room, the light in some cases has a remarkable power\r\n(as was likewise observed by Dutrochet, p. 998, with the pea) on the\r\nrevolving movement, but this differs in degree with different plants;\r\nthus _Ipomoea jucunda_ made a complete circle in 5 hrs. 30 m.; the\r\nsemicircle from the light taking 4 hrs. 80 m., and that towards the light\r\nonly 1 hr.  _Lonicera brachypoda_ revolved, in a reversed direction to\r\nthe _Ipomoea_, in 8 hrs.; the semicircle from the light taking 5 hrs. 23\r\nm., and that to the light only 2 hrs. 37 m.  From the rate of revolution\r\nin all the plants observed by me, being nearly the same during the night\r\nand the day, I infer that the action of the light is confined to\r\nretarding one semicircle and accelerating the other, so as not to modify\r\ngreatly the rate of the whole revolution.  This action of the light is\r\nremarkable, when we reflect how little the leaves are developed on the\r\nyoung and thin revolving internodes.  It is all the more remarkable, as\r\nbotanists believe (Mohl, p. 119) that twining plants are but little\r\nsensitive to the action of light.\r\n\r\nI will conclude my account of twining plants by giving a few\r\nmiscellaneous and curious cases.  With most twining plants all the\r\nbranches, however many there may be, go on revolving together; but,\r\naccording to Mohl (p. 4), only the lateral branches of _Tamus\r\nelephantipes_ twine, and not the main stem.  On the other hand, with a\r\nclimbing species of Asparagus, the leading shoot alone, and not the\r\nbranches, revolved and twined; but it should be stated that the plant was\r\nnot growing vigorously.  My plants of _Combretum argenteum_ and _C.\r\npurpureum_ made numerous short healthy shoots; but they showed no signs\r\nof revolving, and I could not conceive how these plants could be\r\nclimbers; but at last _C. argenteum_ put forth from the lower part of one\r\nof its main branches a thin shoot, 5 or 6 feet in length, differing\r\ngreatly in appearance from the previous shoots, owing to its leaves being\r\nlittle developed, and this shoot revolved vigorously and twined.  So that\r\nthis plant produces shoots of two kinds.  With _Periploca Græca_ (Palm,\r\np. 43) the uppermost shoots alone twine.  Polygonum convolvulus twines\r\nonly during the middle of the summer (Palm, p. 43, 94); and plants\r\ngrowing vigorously in the autumn show no inclination to climb.  The\r\nmajority of Asclepiadaceæ are twiners; but _Asclepias nigra_ only “in\r\nfertiliori solo incipit scandere subvolubili caule” (Willdenow, quoted\r\nand confirmed by Palm, p. 41).  _Asclepias vincetoxicum_ does not\r\nregularly twine, but occasionally does so (Palm, p. 42; Mohl, p. 112)\r\nwhen growing under certain conditions.  So it is with two species of\r\n_Ceropegia_, as I hear from Prof.  Harvey, for these plants in their\r\nnative dry South African home generally grow erect, from 6 inches to 2\r\nfeet in height,—a very few taller specimens showing some inclination to\r\ncurve; but when cultivated near Dublin, they regularly twined up sticks 5\r\nor 6 feet in height.  Most Convolvulaceæ are excellent twiners; but in\r\nSouth Africa _Ipomoea argyræoides_ almost always grows erect and compact,\r\nfrom about 12 to 18 inches in height, one specimen alone in Prof.\r\nHarvey’s collection showing an evident disposition to twine.  On the\r\nother hand, seedlings raised near Dublin twined up sticks above 8 feet in\r\nheight.  These facts are remarkable; for there can hardly be a doubt that\r\nin the dryer provinces of South Africa these plants have propagated\r\nthemselves for thousands of generations in an erect condition; and yet\r\nthey have retained during this whole period the innate power of\r\nspontaneously revolving and twining, whenever their shoots become\r\nelongated under proper conditions of life.  Most of the species of\r\n_Phaseolus_ are twiners; but certain varieties of the _P. multiflorus_\r\nproduce (Léon, p. 681) two kinds of shoots, some upright and thick, and\r\nothers thin and twining.  I have seen striking instances of this curious\r\ncase of variability in “Fulmer’s dwarf forcing-bean,” which occasionally\r\nproduced a single long twining shoot.\r\n\r\n_Solanum dulcamara_ is one of the feeblest and poorest of twiners: it may\r\noften be seen growing as an upright bush, and when growing in the midst\r\nof a thicket merely scrambles up between the branches without twining;\r\nbut when, according to Dutrochet (tom. xix. p. 299), it grows near a thin\r\nand flexible support, such as the stem of a nettle, it twines round it.\r\nI placed sticks round several plants, and vertically stretched strings\r\nclose to others, and the strings alone were ascended by twining.  The\r\nstem twines indifferently to the right or left.  Some others species of\r\nSolanum, and of another genus, viz. _Habrothamnus_, belonging to the same\r\nfamily, are described in horticultural works as twining plants, but they\r\nseem to possess this faculty in a very feeble degree.  We may suspect\r\nthat the species of these two genera have as yet only partially acquired\r\nthe habit of twining.  On the other hand with _Tecoma radicans_, a member\r\nof a family abounding with twiners and tendril-bearers, but which climbs,\r\nlike the ivy, by the aid of rootlets, we may suspect that a former habit\r\nof twining has been lost, for the stem exhibited slight irregular\r\nmovements which could hardly be accounted for by changes in the action of\r\nthe light.  There is no difficulty in understanding how a spirally\r\ntwining plant could graduate into a simple root-climber; for the young\r\ninternodes of _Bignonia Tweedyana_ and of _Hoya carnosa_ revolve and\r\ntwine, but likewise emit rootlets which adhere to any fitting surface, so\r\nthat the loss of twining would be no great disadvantage and in some\r\nrespects an advantage to these species, as they would then ascend their\r\nsupports in a more direct line. {44}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nLEAF-CLIMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants which climb by the aid of spontaneously revolving and sensitive\r\npetioles—_Clematis_—_Tropæolum_—_Maurandia_, flower-peduncles moving\r\nspontaneously and sensitive to a\r\ntouch—_Rhodochiton_—_Lophospermum_—internodes sensitive—_Solanum_,\r\nthickening of the clasped petioles—_Fumaria_—_Adlumia_—Plants which climb\r\nby the aid of their produced\r\nmidribs—_Gloriosa_—_Flagellaria_—_Nepenthes_—Summary on leaf-climbers.\r\n\r\nWE now come to our second class of climbing plants, namely, those which\r\nascend by the aid of irritable or sensitive organs.  For convenience’\r\nsake the plants in this class have been grouped under two sub-divisions,\r\nnamely, leaf-climbers, or those which retain their leaves in a functional\r\ncondition, and tendril-bearers.  But these sub-divisions graduate into\r\neach other, as we shall see under Corydalis and the Gloriosa lily.\r\n\r\nIt has long been observed that several plants climb by the aid of their\r\nleaves, either by their petioles (foot-stalks) or by their produced\r\nmidribs; but beyond this simple fact they have not been described.  Palm\r\nand Mohl class these plants with those which bear tendrils; but as a leaf\r\nis generally a defined object, the present classification, though\r\nartificial, has at least some advantages.  Leaf-climbers are, moreover,\r\nintermediate in many respects between twiners and tendril-bearers.  Eight\r\nspecies of _Clematis_ and seven of _Tropæolum_ were observed, in order to\r\nsee what amount of difference in the manner of climbing existed within\r\nthe same genus; and the differences are considerable.\r\n\r\nCLEMATIS.—_C. glandulosa_.—The thin upper internodes revolve, moving\r\nagainst the course of the sun, precisely like those of a true twiner, at\r\nan average rate, judging from three revolutions, of 3 hrs. 48 m.  The\r\nleading shoot immediately twined round a stick placed near it; but, after\r\nmaking an open spire of only one turn and a half, it ascended for a short\r\nspace straight, and then reversed its course and wound two turns in an\r\nopposite direction.  This was rendered possible by the straight piece\r\nbetween the opposed spires having become rigid.  The simple, broad, ovate\r\nleaves of this tropical species, with their short thick petioles, seem\r\nbut ill-fitted for any movement; and whilst twining up a vertical stick,\r\nno use is made of them.  Nevertheless, if the footstalk of a young leaf\r\nbe rubbed with a thin twig a few times on any side, it will in the course\r\nof a few hours bend to that side; afterwards becoming straight again.\r\nThe under side seemed to be the most sensitive; but the sensitiveness or\r\nirritability is slight compared to that which we shall meet with in some\r\nof the following species; thus, a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain\r\n(106.2 mg.) and hanging for some days on a young footstalk, produced a\r\nscarcely perceptible effect.  A sketch is here given of two young leaves\r\nwhich had naturally caught hold of two thin branches.  A forked twig\r\nplaced so as to press lightly on the under side of a young footstalk\r\ncaused it, in 12 hrs., to bend greatly, and ultimately to such an extent\r\nthat the leaf passed to the opposite side of the stem; the forked stick\r\nhaving been removed, the leaf slowly recovered its former position.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 1.  Clematis glandulosa.  With two young leaves clasping\r\n             two twigs, with the clasping portions thickened]\r\n\r\nThe young leaves spontaneously and gradually change their position: when\r\nfirst developed the petioles are upturned and parallel to the stem; they\r\nthen slowly bend downwards, remaining for a short time at right angles to\r\nthe stem, and then become so much arched downwards that the blade of the\r\nleaf points to the ground with its tip curled inwards, so that the whole\r\npetiole and leaf together form a hook.  They are thus enabled to catch\r\nhold of any twig with which they may be brought into contact by the\r\nrevolving movement of the internodes.  If this does not happen, they\r\nretain their hooked shape for a considerable time, and then bending\r\nupwards reassume their original upturned position, which is preserved\r\never afterwards.  The petioles which have clasped any object soon become\r\nmuch thickened and strengthened, as may be seen in the drawing.\r\n\r\n_Clematis montana_.—The long, thin petioles of the leaves, whilst young,\r\nare sensitive, and when lightly rubbed bend to the rubbed side,\r\nsubsequently becoming straight.  They are far more sensitive than the\r\npetioles of _C. glandulosa_; for a loop of thread weighing a quarter of a\r\ngrain (16.2 mg.) caused them to bend; a loop weighing only one-eighth of\r\na grain (8.1 mg.) sometimes acted and sometimes did not act.  The\r\nsensitiveness extends from the blade of the leaf to the stem.  I may here\r\nstate that I ascertained in all cases the weights of the string and\r\nthread used by carefully weighing 50 inches in a chemical balance, and\r\nthen cutting off measured lengths.  The main petiole carries three\r\nleaflets; but their short, sub-petioles are not sensitive.  A young,\r\ninclined shoot (the plant being in the greenhouse) made a large circle\r\nopposed to the course of the sun in 4 hrs. 20 m., but the next day, being\r\nvery cold, the time was 5 hrs. 10 m.  A stick placed near a revolving\r\nstem was soon struck by the petioles which stand out at right angles, and\r\nthe revolving movement was thus arrested.  The petioles then began, being\r\nexcited by the contact, to slowly wind round the stick.  When the stick\r\nwas thin, a petiole sometimes wound twice round it.  The opposite leaf\r\nwas in no way affected.  The attitude assumed by the stem after the\r\npetiole had clasped the stick, was that of a man standing by a column,\r\nwho throws his arm horizontally round it.  With respect to the stem’s\r\npower of twining, some remarks will be made under _C. calycina_.\r\n\r\n_Clematis Sieboldi_.—A shoot made three revolutions against the sun at an\r\naverage rate of 3 hrs. 11 m.  The power of twining is like that of the\r\nlast species.  Its leaves are nearly similar in structure and in\r\nfunction, excepting that the sub-petioles of the lateral and terminal\r\nleaflets are sensitive.  A loop of thread, weighing one-eighth of a\r\ngrain, acted on the main petiole, but not until two or three days had\r\nelapsed.  The leaves have the remarkable habit of spontaneously\r\nrevolving, generally in vertical ellipses, in the same manner, but in a\r\nless degree, as will be described under _C. microphylla_.\r\n\r\n_Clematis calycina_.—The young shoots are thin and flexible: one\r\nrevolved, describing a broad oval, in 5 hrs. 30 m., and another in 6 hrs.\r\n12 m.  They followed the course of the sun; but the course, if observed\r\nlong enough, would probably be found to vary in this species, as well as\r\nin all the others of the genus.  It is a rather better twiner than the\r\ntwo last species: the stem sometimes made two spiral turns round a thin\r\nstick, if free from twigs; it then ran straight up for a space, and\r\nreversing its course took one or two turns in an opposite direction.\r\nThis reversal of the spire occurred in all the foregoing species.  The\r\nleaves are so small compared with those of most of the other species,\r\nthat the petioles at first seem ill-adapted for clasping.  Nevertheless,\r\nthe main service of the revolving movement is to bring them into contact\r\nwith surrounding objects, which are slowly but securely seized.  The\r\nyoung petioles, which alone are sensitive, have their ends bowed a little\r\ndownwards, so as to be in a slight degree hooked; ultimately the whole\r\nleaf, if it catches nothing, becomes level.  I gently rubbed with a thin\r\ntwig the lower surfaces of two young petioles; and in 2 hrs. 30 m. they\r\nwere slightly curved downwards; in 5 hrs., after being rubbed, the end of\r\none was bent completely back, parallel to the basal portion; in 4 hrs.\r\nsubsequently it became nearly straight again.  To show how sensitive the\r\nyoung petioles are, I may mention that I just touched the under sides of\r\ntwo with a little water-colour, which when dry formed an excessively thin\r\nand minute crust; but this sufficed in 24 hrs. to cause both to bend\r\ndownwards.  Whilst the plant is young, each leaf consists of three\r\ndivided leaflets, which barely have distinct petioles, and these are not\r\nsensitive; but when the plant is well grown, the petioles of the two\r\nlateral and terminal leaflets are of considerable length, and become\r\nsensitive so as to be capable of clasping an object in any direction.\r\n\r\nWhen a petiole has clasped a twig, it undergoes some remarkable changes,\r\nwhich may be observed with the other species, but in a less strongly\r\nmarked manner, and will here be described once for all.  The clasped\r\npetiole in the course of two or three days swells greatly, and ultimately\r\nbecomes nearly twice as thick as the opposite one which has clasped\r\nnothing.  When thin transverse slices of the two are placed under the\r\nmicroscope their difference is conspicuous: the side of the petiole which\r\nhas been in contact with the support, is formed of a layer of colourless\r\ncells with their longer axes directed from the centre, and these are very\r\nmuch larger than the corresponding cells in the opposite or unchanged\r\npetiole; the central cells, also, are in some degree enlarged, and the\r\nwhole is much indurated.  The exterior surface generally becomes bright\r\nred.  But a far greater change takes place in the nature of the tissues\r\nthan that which is visible: the petiole of the unclasped leaf is flexible\r\nand can be snapped easily, whereas the clasped one acquires an\r\nextraordinary degree of toughness and rigidity, so that considerable\r\nforce is required to pull it into pieces.  With this change, great\r\ndurability is probably acquired; at least this is the case with the\r\nclasped petioles of _Clematis vitalba_.  The meaning of these changes is\r\nobvious, namely, that the petioles may firmly and durably support the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n_Clematis microphylla_, var. _leptophylla_.—The long and thin internodes\r\nof this Australian species revolve sometimes in one direction and\r\nsometimes in an opposite one, describing long, narrow, irregular ellipses\r\nor large circles.  Four revolutions were completed within five minutes of\r\nthe same average rate of 1 hr. 51 m.; so that this species moves more\r\nquickly than the others of the genus.  The shoots, when placed near a\r\nvertical stick, either twine round it, or clasp it with the basal\r\nportions of their petioles.  The leaves whilst young are nearly of the\r\nsame shape as those of _C. viticella_, and act in the same manner like a\r\nhook, as will be described under that species.  But the leaflets are more\r\ndivided, and each segment whilst young terminates in a hardish point,\r\nwhich is much curved downwards and inwards; so that the whole leaf\r\nreadily catches hold of any neighbouring object.  The petioles of the\r\nyoung terminal leaflets are acted on by loops of thread weighing ⅛th and\r\neven 0.0625th of a grain.  The basal portion of the main petiole is much\r\nless sensitive, but will clasp a stick against which it presses.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, whilst young, are continually and spontaneously moving\r\nslowly.  A bell-glass was placed over a shoot secured to a stick, and the\r\nmovements of the leaves were traced on it during several days.  A very\r\nirregular line was generally formed; but one day, in the course of eight\r\nhours and three quarters, the figure clearly represented three and a half\r\nirregular ellipses, the most perfect one of which was completed in 2 hrs.\r\n35 m.  The two opposite leaves moved independently of each other.  This\r\nmovement of the leaves would aid that of the internodes in bringing the\r\npetioles into contact with surrounding objects.  I discovered this\r\nmovement too late to be enabled to observe it in the other species; but\r\nfrom analogy I can hardly doubt that the leaves of at least _C.\r\nviticella_, _C. flammula_, and _C. vitalba_ move spontaneously; and,\r\njudging from _C. Sieboldi_, this probably is the case with _C. montana_\r\nand _C. calycina_.  I ascertained that the simple leaves of _C.\r\nglandulosa_ exhibited no spontaneous revolving movement.\r\n\r\n_Clematis viticella_, var. _venosa_.—In this and the two following\r\nspecies the power of spirally twining is completely lost, and this seems\r\ndue to the lessened flexibility of the internodes and to the interference\r\ncaused by the large size of the leaves.  But the revolving movement,\r\nthough restricted, is not lost.  In our present species a young\r\ninternode, placed in front of a window, made three narrow ellipses,\r\ntransversely to the direction of the light, at an average rate of 2 hrs.\r\n40 m.  When placed so that the movements were to and from the light, the\r\nrate was greatly accelerated in one half of the course, and retarded in\r\nthe other, as with twining plants.  The ellipses were small; the longer\r\ndiameter, described by the apex of a shoot bearing a pair of not expanded\r\nleaves, was only 4⅝ inches, and that by the apex of the penultimate\r\ninternode only 1⅛ inch.  At the most favourable period of growth each\r\nleaf would hardly be carried to and fro by the movement of the internodes\r\nmore than two or three inches, but, as above stated, it is probable that\r\nthe leaves themselves move spontaneously.  The movement of the whole\r\nshoot by the wind and by its rapid growth, would probably be almost\r\nequally efficient as these spontaneous movements, in bringing the\r\npetioles into contact with surrounding objects.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are of large size.  Each bears three pairs of lateral leaflets\r\nand a terminal one, all supported on rather long sub-petioles.  The main\r\npetiole bends a little angularly downwards at each point where a pair of\r\nleaflets arises (see fig. 2), and the petiole of the terminal leaflet is\r\nbent downwards at right angles; hence the whole petiole, with its\r\nrectangularly bent extremity, acts as a hook.  This hook, the lateral\r\npetioles being directed a little upwards; forms an excellent grappling\r\napparatus, by which the leaves readily become entangled with surrounding\r\nobjects.  If they catch nothing, the whole petiole ultimately grows\r\nstraight.  The main petiole, the sub-petioles, and the three branches\r\ninto which each basi-lateral sub-petiole is generally subdivided, are all\r\nsensitive.  The basal portion of the main petiole, between the stem and\r\nthe first pair of leaflets, is less sensitive than the remainder; it\r\nwill, however, clasp a stick with which it is left in contact.  The\r\ninferior surface of the rectangularly bent terminal portion (carrying the\r\nterminal leaflet), which forms the inner side of the end of the hook, is\r\nthe most sensitive part; and this portion is manifestly best adapted to\r\ncatch a distant support.  To show the difference in sensibility, I gently\r\nplaced loops of string of the same weight (in one instance weighing only\r\n0.82 of a grain or 53.14 mg.) on the several lateral sub-petioles and on\r\nthe terminal one; in a few hours the latter was bent, but after 24 hrs.\r\nno effect was produced on the other sub-petioles.  Again, a terminal\r\nsub-petiole placed in contact with a thin stick became sensibly curved in\r\n45 m., and in 1 hr. 10 m. moved through ninety degrees; whilst a lateral\r\nsub-petiole did not become sensibly curved until 3 hrs. 30 m. had\r\nelapsed.  In all cases, if the sticks are taken away, the petioles\r\ncontinue to move during many hours afterwards; so they do after a slight\r\nrubbing; but they become straight again, after about a day’s interval,\r\nthat is if the flexure has not been very great or long continued.\r\n\r\n          [Picture: Fig. 2.  A young leaf of Clematis viticeela]\r\n\r\nThe graduated difference in the extension of the sensitiveness in the\r\npetioles of the above-described species deserves notice.  In _C. montana_\r\nit is confined to the main petiole, and has not spread to the\r\nsub-petioles of the three leaflets; so it is with young plants of _C.\r\ncalycina_, but in older plants it spreads to the three sub-petioles.  In\r\n_C. viticella_ the sensitiveness has spread to the petioles of the seven\r\nleaflets, and to the subdivisions of the basi-lateral sub-petioles.  But\r\nin this latter species it has diminished in the basal part of the main\r\npetiole, in which alone it resided in _C. montana_; whilst it has\r\nincreased in the abruptly bent terminal portion.\r\n\r\n_Clematis flammula_.—The rather thick, straight, and stiff shoots, whilst\r\ngrowing vigorously in the spring, make small oval revolutions, following\r\nthe sun in their course.  Four were made at an average rate of 3 hrs. 45\r\nm.  The longer axis of the oval, described by the extreme tip, was\r\ndirected at right angles to the line joining the opposite leaves; its\r\nlength was in one case only 1⅜, and in another case 1¾ inch; so that the\r\nyoung leaves were moved a very short distance.  The shoots of the same\r\nplant observed in midsummer, when growing not so quickly, did not revolve\r\nat all.  I cut down another plant in the early summer, so that by August\r\n1st it had formed new and moderately vigorous shoots; these, when\r\nobserved under a bell-glass, were on some days quite stationary, and on\r\nother days moved to and fro only about the eighth of an inch.\r\nConsequently the revolving power is much enfeebled in this species, and\r\nunder unfavourable circumstances is completely lost.  The shoot must\r\ndepend for coming into contact with surrounding objects on the probable,\r\nthough not ascertained spontaneous movement of the leaves, on rapid\r\ngrowth, and on movement from the wind.  Hence, perhaps, it is that the\r\npetioles have acquired a high degree of sensitiveness as a compensation\r\nfor the little power of movement in the shoots.\r\n\r\nThe petioles are bowed downwards, and have the same general hook-like\r\nform as in _C. viticella_.  The medial petiole and the lateral\r\nsub-petioles are sensitive, especially the much bent terminal portion.\r\nAs the sensitiveness is here greater than in any other species of the\r\ngenus observed by me, and is in itself remarkable, I will give fuller\r\ndetails.  The petioles, when so young that they have not separated from\r\none another, are not sensitive; when the lamina of a leaflet has grown to\r\na quarter of an inch in length (that is, about one-sixth of its full\r\nsize), the sensitiveness is highest; but at this period the petioles are\r\nrelatively much more fully developed than are the blades of the leaves.\r\nFull-grown petioles are not in the least sensitive.  A thin stick placed\r\nso as to press lightly against a petiole, having a leaflet a quarter of\r\nan inch in length, caused the petiole to bend in 3 hrs. 15 m.  In another\r\ncase a petiole curled completely round a stick in 12 hrs. These petioles\r\nwere left curled for 24 hrs., and the sticks were then removed; but they\r\nnever straightened themselves.  I took a twig, thinner than the petiole\r\nitself, and with it lightly rubbed several petioles four times up and\r\ndown; these in 1 hr. 45 m. became slightly curled; the curvature\r\nincreased during some hours and then began to decrease, but after 25 hrs.\r\nfrom the time of rubbing a vestige of the curvature remained.  Some other\r\npetioles similarly rubbed twice, that is, once up and once down, became\r\nperceptibly curved in about 2 hrs. 30 m., the terminal sub-petiole moving\r\nmore than the lateral sub-petioles; they all became straight again in\r\nbetween 12 hrs. and 14 hrs.  Lastly, a length of about one-eighth of an\r\ninch of a sub-petiole, was lightly rubbed with the same twig only once;\r\nit became slightly curved in 3 hrs., remaining so during 11 hrs., but by\r\nthe next morning was quite straight.\r\n\r\nThe following observations are more precise.  After trying heavier pieces\r\nof string and thread, I placed a loop of fine string, weighing 1.04 gr.\r\n(67.4 mg.) on a terminal sub-petiole: in 6 hrs. 40 m. a curvature could\r\nbe seen; in 24 hrs. the petiole formed an open ring round the string; in\r\n48 hrs. the ring had almost closed on the string, and in 72 hrs. seized\r\nit so firmly, that some force was necessary for its withdrawal.  A loop\r\nweighing 0.52 of a grain (33.7 mg.) caused in 14 hrs. a lateral\r\nsub-petiole just perceptibly to curve, and in 24 hrs. it moved through\r\nninety degrees.  These observations were made during the summer: the\r\nfollowing were made in the spring, when the petioles apparently are more\r\nsensitive:—A loop of thread, weighing one-eighth of a grain (8.1 mg.),\r\nproduced no effect on the lateral sub-petioles, but placed on a terminal\r\none, caused it, after 24 hrs., to curve moderately; the curvature, though\r\nthe loop remained suspended, was after 48 hrs. diminished, but never\r\ndisappeared; showing that the petiole had become partially accustomed to\r\nthe insufficient stimulus.  This experiment was twice repeated with\r\nnearly the same result.  Lastly, a loop of thread, weighing only\r\none-sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.) was twice gently placed by a forceps\r\non a terminal sub-petiole (the plant being, of course, in a still and\r\nclosed room), and this weight certainly caused a flexure, which very\r\nslowly increased until the petiole moved through nearly ninety degrees:\r\nbeyond this it did not move; nor did the petiole, the loop remaining\r\nsuspended, ever become perfectly straight again.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider, on the one hand, the thickness and stiffness of the\r\npetioles, and, on the other hand, the thinness and softness of fine\r\ncotton thread, and what an extremely small weight one-sixteenth of a\r\ngrain (4.05 mg.) is, these facts are remarkable.  But I have reason to\r\nbelieve that even a less weight excites curvature when pressing over a\r\nbroader surface than that acted on by a thread.  Having noticed that the\r\nend of a suspended string which accidentally touched a petiole, caused it\r\nto bend, I took two pieces of thin twine, 10 inches in length (weighing\r\n1.64 gr.), and, tying them to a stick, let them hang as nearly\r\nperpendicularly downwards as their thinness and flexuous form, after\r\nbeing stretched, would permit; I then quietly placed their ends so as\r\njust to rest on two petioles, and these certainly became curved in 36\r\nhrs. One of the ends touched the angle between a terminal and lateral\r\nsub-petiole, and it was in 48 hours caught between them as by a forceps.\r\nIn these cases the pressure, though spread over a wider surface than that\r\ntouched by the cotton thread, must have been excessively slight.\r\n\r\n_Clematis vitalba_.—The plants were in pots and not healthy, so that I\r\ndare not trust my observations, which indicate much similarity in habits\r\nwith _C. flammula_.  I mention this species only because I have seen many\r\nproofs that the petioles in a state of nature are excited to movement by\r\nvery slight pressure.  For instance, I have found them embracing thin\r\nwithered blades of grass, the soft young leaves of a maple, and the\r\nflower-peduncles of the quaking-grass or Briza.  The latter are about as\r\nthick as the hair of a man’s beard, but they were completely surrounded\r\nand clasped.  The petioles of a leaf, so young that none of the leaflets\r\nwere expanded, had partially seized a twig.  Those of almost all the old\r\nleaves, even when unattached to any object, are much convoluted; but this\r\nis owing to their having come, whilst young, into contact during several\r\nhours with some object subsequently removed.  With none of the\r\nabove-described species, cultivated in pots and carefully observed, was\r\nthere any permanent bending of the petioles without the stimulus of\r\ncontact.  In winter, the blades of the leaves of _C. vitalba_ drop off;\r\nbut the petioles (as was observed by Mohl) remain attached to the\r\nbranches, sometimes during two seasons; and, being convoluted, they\r\ncuriously resemble true tendrils, such as those possessed by the allied\r\ngenus _Naravelia_.  The petioles which have clasped some object become\r\nmuch more stiff, hard, and polished than those which have failed in this\r\ntheir proper function.\r\n\r\nTROPÆOLUM.—I observed _T. tricolorum_, _T. azureum_, _T. pentaphyllum_,\r\n_T. peregrinum_, _T. elegans_, _T. tuberosum_, and a dwarf variety of, as\r\nI believe, _T. minus_.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum tricolorum_, var. _grandiflorum_.—The flexible shoots, which\r\nfirst rise from the tubers, are as thin as fine twine.  One such shoot\r\nrevolved in a course opposed to the sun, at an average rate, judging from\r\nthree revolutions, of 1 hr. 23 m.; but no doubt the direction of the\r\nrevolving movement is variable.  When the plants have grown tall and are\r\nbranched, all the many lateral shoots revolve.  The stem, whilst young,\r\ntwines regularly round a thin vertical stick, and in one case I counted\r\neight spiral turns in the same direction; but when grown older, the stem\r\noften runs straight up for a space, and, being arrested by the clasping\r\npetioles, makes one or two spires in a reversed direction.  Until the\r\nplant grows to a height of two or three feet, requiring about a month\r\nfrom the time when the first shoot appears above ground, no true leaves\r\nare produced, but, in their place, filaments coloured like the stem.  The\r\nextremities of these filaments are pointed, a little flattened, and\r\nfurrowed on the upper surface.  They never become developed into leaves.\r\nAs the plant grows in height new filaments are produced with slightly\r\nenlarged tips; then others, bearing on each side of the enlarged medial\r\ntip a rudimentary segment of a leaf; soon other segments appear, and at\r\nlast a perfect leaf is formed, with seven deep segments.  So that on the\r\nsame plant we may see every step, from tendril-like clasping filaments to\r\nperfect leaves with clasping petioles.  After the plant has grown to a\r\nconsiderable height, and is secured to its support by the petioles of the\r\ntrue leaves, the clasping filaments on the lower part of the stem wither\r\nand drop off; so that they perform only a temporary service.\r\n\r\nThese filaments or rudimentary leaves, as well as the petioles of the\r\nperfect leaves, whilst young, are highly sensitive on all sides to a\r\ntouch.  The slightest rub caused them to curve towards the rubbed side in\r\nabout three minutes, and one bent itself into a ring in six minutes; they\r\nsubsequently became straight.  When, however, they have once completely\r\nclasped a stick, if this is removed, they do not straighten themselves.\r\nThe most remarkable fact, and one which I have observed in no other\r\nspecies of the genus, is that the filaments and the petioles of the young\r\nleaves, if they catch no object, after standing for some days in their\r\noriginal position, spontaneously and slowly oscillate a little from side\r\nto side, and then move towards the stem and clasp it.  They likewise\r\noften become, after a time, in some degree spirally contracted.  They\r\ntherefore fully deserve to be called tendrils, as they are used for\r\nclimbing, are sensitive to a touch, move spontaneously, and ultimately\r\ncontract into a spire, though an imperfect one.  The present species\r\nwould have been classed amongst the tendril-bearers, had not these\r\ncharacters been confined to early youth.  During maturity it is a true\r\nleaf-climber.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum azureum_.—An upper internode made four revolutions, following\r\nthe sun, at an average rate of 1 hr. 47 m.  The stem twined spirally\r\nround a support in the same irregular manner as that of the last species.\r\nRudimentary leaves or filaments do not exist.  The petioles of the young\r\nleaves are very sensitive: a single light rub with a twig caused one to\r\nmove perceptibly in 5 m., and another in 6 m.  The former became bent at\r\nright angles in 15 min., and became straight again in between 5 hrs. and\r\n6 hrs.  A loop of thread weighing ⅛th of a grain caused another petiole\r\nto curve.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum pentaphyllum_.—This species has not the power of spirally\r\ntwining, which seems due, not so much to a want of flexibility in the\r\nstem, as to continual interference from the clasping petioles.  An upper\r\ninternode made three revolutions, following the sun, at an average rate\r\nof 1 hr. 46 m.  The main purpose of the revolving movement in all the\r\nspecies of _Tropæolum_ manifestly is to bring the petioles into contact\r\nwith some supporting object.  The petiole of a young leaf, after a slight\r\nrub, became curved in 6 m.; another, on a cold day, in 20 m., and others\r\nin from 8 m. to 10 m.  Their curvature usually increased greatly in from\r\n15 m. to 20 m., and they became straight again in between 5 hrs. and 6\r\nhrs., but on one occasion in 3 hrs.  When a petiole has fairly clasped a\r\nstick, it is not able, on the removal of the stick, to straighten itself.\r\nThe free upper part of one, the base of which had already clasped a\r\nstick, still retained the power of movement.  A loop of thread weighing\r\n⅛th of a grain caused a petiole to curve; but the stimulus was not\r\nsufficient, the loop remaining suspended, to cause a permanent flexure.\r\nIf a much heavier loop be placed in the angle between the petiole and the\r\nstem, it produces no effect; whereas we have seen with _Clematis montana_\r\nthat the angle between the stem and petiole is sensitive.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum peregrinum_.—The first-formed internodes of a young plant did\r\nnot revolve, resembling in this respect those of a twining plant.  In an\r\nolder plant the four upper internodes made three irregular revolutions,\r\nin a course opposed to the sun, at an average rate of 1 hr. 48 min.  It\r\nis remarkable that the average rate of revolution (taken, however, but\r\nfrom few observations) is very nearly the same in this and the two last\r\nspecies, namely, 1 hr. 47 m., 1 hr. 46 m., and 1 hr. 48 m.  The present\r\nspecies cannot twine spirally, which seems mainly due to the rigidity of\r\nthe stem.  In a very young plant, which did not revolve, the petioles\r\nwere not sensitive.  In older plants the petioles of quite young leaves,\r\nand of leaves as much as an inch and a quarter in diameter, are\r\nsensitive.  A moderate rub caused one to curve in 10 m., and others in 20\r\nm.  They became straight again in between 5 hrs. 45 m. and 8 hrs.\r\nPetioles which have naturally come into contact with a stick, sometimes\r\ntake two turns round it.  After they have clasped a support, they become\r\nrigid and hard.  They are less sensitive to a weight than in the previous\r\nspecies; for loops of string weighing 0.82 of a grain (53.14 mg.), did\r\nnot cause any curvature, but a loop of double this weight (1.64 gr.)\r\nacted.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum elegans_.—I did not make many observations on this species.\r\nThe short and stiff internodes revolve irregularly, describing small oval\r\nfigures.  One oval was completed in 3 hrs. A young petiole, when rubbed,\r\nbecame slightly curved in 17 m.; and afterwards much more so.  It was\r\nnearly straight again in 8 hrs.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum tuberosum_.—On a plant nine inches in height, the internodes\r\ndid not move at all; but on an older plant they moved irregularly and\r\nmade small imperfect ovals.  These movements could be detected only by\r\nbeing traced on a bell-glass placed over the plant.  Sometimes the shoots\r\nstood still for hours; during some days they moved only in one direction\r\nin a crooked line; on other days they made small irregular spires or\r\ncircles, one being completed in about 4 hrs.  The extreme points reached\r\nby the apex of the shoot were only about one or one and a half inches\r\nasunder; yet this slight movement brought the petioles into contact with\r\nsome closely surrounding twigs, which were then clasped.  With the\r\nlessened power of spontaneously revolving, compared with that of the\r\nprevious species, the sensitiveness of the petioles is also diminished.\r\nThese, when rubbed a few times, did not become curved until half an hour\r\nhad elapsed; the curvature increased during the next two hours, and then\r\nvery slowly decreased; so that they sometimes required 24 hrs. to become\r\nstraight again.  Extremely young leaves have active petioles; one with\r\nthe lamina only 0.15 of an inch in diameter, that is, about a twentieth\r\nof the full size, firmly clasped a thin twig.  But leaves grown to a\r\nquarter of their full size can likewise act.\r\n\r\n_Tropæolum minus_ (?).—The internodes of a variety named “dwarf crimson\r\nNasturtium” did not revolve, but moved in a rather irregular course\r\nduring the day to the light, and from the light at night.  The petioles,\r\nwhen well rubbed, showed no power of curving; nor could I see that they\r\never clasped any neighbouring object.  We have seen in this genus a\r\ngradation from species such as _T. tricolorum_, which have extremely\r\nsensitive petioles, and internodes which rapidly revolve and spirally\r\ntwine up a support, to other species such as _T. elegans_ and _T.\r\ntuberosum_, the petioles of which are much less sensitive, and the\r\ninternodes of which have very feeble revolving powers and cannot spirally\r\ntwine round a support, to this last species, which has entirely lost or\r\nnever acquired these faculties.  From the general character of the genus,\r\nthe loss of power seems the more probable alternative.\r\n\r\nIn the present species, in _T. elegans_, and probably in others, the\r\nflower-peduncle, as soon as the seed-capsule begins to swell,\r\nspontaneously bends abruptly downwards and becomes somewhat convoluted.\r\nIf a stick stands in the way, it is to a certain extent clasped; but, as\r\nfar as I have been able to observe, this clasping movement is independent\r\nof the stimulus from contact.\r\n\r\nANTIRRHINEÆ.—In this tribe (Lindley) of the Scrophulariaceæ, at least\r\nfour of the seven included genera have leaf-climbing species.\r\n\r\n_Maurandia Barclayana_.—A thin, slightly bowed shoot made two\r\nrevolutions, following the sun, each in 3 hrs. 17 min.; on the previous\r\nday this same shoot revolved in an opposite direction.  The shoots do not\r\ntwine spirally, but climb excellently by the aid of their young and\r\nsensitive petioles.  These petioles, when lightly rubbed, move after a\r\nconsiderable interval of time, and subsequently become straight again.  A\r\nloop of thread weighing ⅛th of a grain caused them to bend.\r\n\r\n_Maurandia semperflorens_.—This freely growing species climbs exactly\r\nlike the last, by the aid of its sensitive petioles.  A young internode\r\nmade two circles, each in 1 hr. 46 min.; so that it moved almost twice as\r\nrapidly as the last species.  The internodes are not in the least\r\nsensitive to a touch or pressure.  I mention this because they are\r\nsensitive in a closely allied genus, namely, Lophospermum.  The present\r\nspecies is unique in one respect.  Mohl asserts (p. 45) that “the\r\nflower-peduncles, as well as the petioles, wind like tendrils;” but he\r\nclasses as tendrils such objects as the spiral flower-stalks of the\r\n_Vallisneria_.  This remark, and the fact of the flower-peduncles being\r\ndecidedly flexuous, led me carefully to examine them.  They never act as\r\ntrue tendrils; I repeatedly placed thin sticks in contact with young and\r\nold peduncles, and I allowed nine vigorous plants to grow through an\r\nentangled mass of branches; but in no one instance did they bend round\r\nany object.  It is indeed in the highest degree improbable that this\r\nshould occur, for they are generally developed on branches which have\r\nalready securely clasped a support by the petioles of their leaves; and\r\nwhen borne on a free depending branch, they are not produced by the\r\nterminal portion of the internode which alone has the power of revolving;\r\nso that they could be brought only by accident into contact with any\r\nneighbouring object.  Nevertheless (and this is the remarkable fact) the\r\nflower-peduncles, whilst young, exhibit feeble revolving powers, and are\r\nslightly sensitive to a touch.  Having selected some stems which had\r\nfirmly clasped a stick by their petioles, and having placed a bell-glass\r\nover them, I traced the movements of the young flower-peduncles.  The\r\ntracing generally formed a short and extremely irregular line, with\r\nlittle loops in its course.  A young peduncle 1½ inch in length was\r\ncarefully observed during a whole day, and it made four and a half\r\nnarrow, vertical, irregular, and short ellipses—each at an average rate\r\nof about 2 hrs. 25 m.  An adjoining peduncle described during the same\r\ntime similar, though fewer, ellipses.  As the plant had occupied for some\r\ntime exactly the same position, these movements could not be attributed\r\nto any change in the action of the light.  Peduncles, old enough for the\r\ncoloured petals to be just visible, do not move.  With respect to\r\nirritability, {68} I rubbed two young peduncles (1½ inch in length) a few\r\ntimes very lightly with a thin twig; one was rubbed on the upper, and the\r\nother on the lower side, and they became in between 4 hrs. and 5 hrs.\r\ndistinctly bowed towards these sides; in 24 hrs. subsequently, they\r\nstraightened themselves.  Next day they were rubbed on the opposite\r\nsides, and they became perceptibly curved towards these sides.  Two other\r\nand younger peduncles (three-fourths of an inch in length) were lightly\r\nrubbed on their adjoining sides, and they became so much curved towards\r\none another, that the arcs of the bows stood at nearly right angles to\r\ntheir previous direction; and this was the greatest movement seen by me.\r\nSubsequently they straightened themselves.  Other peduncles, so young as\r\nto be only three-tenths of an inch in length, became curved when rubbed.\r\nOn the other hand, peduncles above 1½ inch in length required to be\r\nrubbed two or three times, and then became only just perceptibly bowed.\r\nLoops of thread suspended on the peduncles produced no effect; loops of\r\nstring, however, weighing 0.82 and 1.64 of a grain sometimes caused a\r\nslight curvature; but they were never closely clasped, as were the far\r\nlighter loops of thread by the petioles.\r\n\r\nIn the nine vigorous plants observed by me, it is certain that neither\r\nthe slight spontaneous movements nor the slight sensitiveness of the\r\nflower-peduncles aided the plants in climbing.  If any member of the\r\nScrophulariaceæ had possessed tendrils produced by the modification of\r\nflower-peduncles, I should have thought that this species of _Maurandia_\r\nhad perhaps retained a useless or rudimentary vestige of a former habit;\r\nbut this view cannot be maintained.  We may suspect that, owing to the\r\nprinciple of correlation, the power of movement has been transferred to\r\nthe flower-peduncles from the young internodes, and sensitiveness from\r\nthe young petioles.  But to whatever cause these capacities are due, the\r\ncase is interesting; for, by a little increase in power through natural\r\nselection, they might easily have been rendered as useful to the plant in\r\nclimbing, as are the flower-peduncles (hereafter to be described) of\r\nVitis or Cardiospermum.\r\n\r\n_Rhodochiton volubile_.—A long flexible shoot swept a large circle,\r\nfollowing the sun, in 5 hrs. 30 m.; and, as the day became warmer, a\r\nsecond circle was completed in 4 hrs. 10 m.  The shoots sometimes make a\r\nwhole or a half spire round a vertical stick, they then run straight up\r\nfor a space, and afterwards turn spirally in an opposite direction.  The\r\npetioles of very young leaves about one-tenth of their full size, are\r\nhighly sensitive, and bend towards the side which is touched; but they do\r\nnot move quickly.  One was perceptibly curved in 1 hr. 10 m., after being\r\nlightly rubbed, and became considerably curved in 5 hrs. 40 m.; some\r\nothers were scarcely curved in 5 hrs. 30 m., but distinctly so in 6 hrs.\r\n30 m.  A curvature was perceptible in one petiole in between 4 hrs. 30 m.\r\nand 5 hrs., after the suspension of a little loop of string.  A loop of\r\nfine cotton thread, weighing one sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.), not\r\nonly caused a petiole slowly to bend, but was ultimately so firmly\r\nclasped that it could be withdrawn only by some little force.  The\r\npetioles, when coming into contact with a stick, take either a complete\r\nor half a turn round it, and ultimately increase much in thickness.  They\r\ndo not possess the power of spontaneously revolving.\r\n\r\n_Lophospermum scandens_, var. _purpureum_.—Some long, moderately thin\r\ninternodes made four revolutions at an average rate of 3 hrs. 15 m.  The\r\ncourse pursued was very irregular, namely, an extremely narrow ellipse, a\r\nlarge circle, an irregular spire or a zigzag line, and sometimes the apex\r\nstood still.  The young petioles, when brought by the revolving movement\r\ninto contact with sticks, clasped them, and soon increased considerably\r\nin thickness.  But they are not quite so sensitive to a weight as those\r\nof the _Rhodochiton_, for loops of thread weighing one-eighth of a grain\r\ndid not always cause them to bend.\r\n\r\nThis plant presents a case not observed by me in any other leaf-climber\r\nor twiner, {71} namely, that the young internodes of the stem are\r\nsensitive to a touch.  When a petiole of this species clasps a stick, it\r\ndraws the base of the internode against it; and then the internode itself\r\nbends towards the stick, which is caught between the stem and the petiole\r\nas by a pair of pincers.  The internode afterwards straightens itself,\r\nexcepting the part in actual contact with the stick.  Young internodes\r\nalone are sensitive, and these are sensitive on all sides along their\r\nwhole length.  I made fifteen trials by twice or thrice lightly rubbing\r\nwith a thin twig several internodes; and in about 2 hrs., but in one case\r\nin 3 hrs., all were bent: they became straight again in about 4 hrs.\r\nafterwards.  An internode, which was rubbed as often as six or seven\r\ntimes, became just perceptibly curved in 1 hr. 15 m., and in 3 hrs. the\r\ncurvature increased much; it became straight again in the course of the\r\nsucceeding night.  I rubbed some internodes one day on one side, and the\r\nnext day either on the opposite side or at right angles to the first\r\nside; and the curvature was always towards the rubbed side.\r\n\r\nAccording to Palm (p. 63), the petioles of _Linaria cirrhosa_ and, to a\r\nlimited degree, those of _L. elatine_ have the power of clasping a\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nSOLANACEÆ.—_Solanum jasminoides_.—Some of the species in this large genus\r\nare twiners; but the present species is a true leaf-climber.  A long,\r\nnearly upright shoot made four revolutions, moving against the sun, very\r\nregularly at an average rate of 3 hrs. 26 m.  The shoots, however,\r\nsometimes stood still.  It is considered a greenhouse plant; but when\r\nkept there, the petioles took several days to clasp a stick: in the\r\nhothouse a stick was clasped in 7 hrs.  In the greenhouse a petiole was\r\nnot affected by a loop of string, suspended during several days and\r\nweighing 2½ grains (163 mg.); but in the hothouse one was made to curve\r\nby a loop weighing 1.64 gr. (106.27 mg.); and, on the removal of the\r\nstring, it became straight again.  Another petiole was not at all acted\r\non by a loop weighing only 0.82 of a grain (53.14 mg.) We have seen that\r\nthe petioles of some other leaf-climbing plants are affected by\r\none-thirteenth of this latter weight.  In this species, and in no other\r\nleaf-climber seen by me, a full-grown leaf is capable of clasping a\r\nstick; but in the greenhouse the movement was so extraordinarily slow\r\nthat the act required several weeks; on each succeeding week it was clear\r\nthat the petiole had become more and more curved, until at last it firmly\r\nclasped the stick.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Fig. 3.  Solanum jasminoides, with one of its petioles clasping\r\n                                 a stick]\r\n\r\nThe flexible petiole of a half or a quarter grown leaf which has clasped\r\nan object for three or four days increases much in thickness, and after\r\nseveral weeks becomes so wonderfully hard and rigid that it can hardly be\r\nremoved from its support.  On comparing a thin transverse slice of such a\r\npetiole with one from an older leaf growing close beneath, which had not\r\nclasped anything, its diameter was found to be fully doubled, and its\r\nstructure greatly changed.  In two other petioles similarly compared, and\r\nhere represented, the increase in diameter was not quite so great.  In\r\nthe section of the petiole in its ordinary state (A), we see a semilunar\r\nband of cellular tissue (not well shown in the woodcut) differing\r\nslightly in appearance from that outside it, and including three closely\r\napproximate groups of dark vessels.  Near the upper surface of the\r\npetiole, beneath two exterior ridges, there are two other small circular\r\ngroups of vessels.  In the section of the petiole (B) which had clasped\r\nduring several weeks a stick, the two exterior ridges have become much\r\nless prominent, and the two groups of woody vessels beneath them much\r\nincreased in diameter.  The semilunar band has been converted into a\r\ncomplete ring of very hard, white, woody tissue, with lines radiating\r\nfrom the centre.  The three groups of vessels, which, though near\r\ntogether, were before distinct, are now completely blended.  The upper\r\npart of this ring of woody vessels, formed by the prolongation of the\r\nhorns of the original semilunar band, is narrower than the lower part,\r\nand slightly less compact.  This petiole after clasping the stick had\r\nactually become thicker than the stem from which it arose; and this was\r\nchiefly due to the increased thickness of the ring of wood.  This ring\r\npresented, both in a transverse and longitudinal section, a closely\r\nsimilar structure to that of the stem.  It is a singular morphological\r\nfact that the petiole should thus acquire a structure almost identically\r\nthe same with that of the axis; and it is a still more singular\r\nphysiological fact that so great a change should have been induced by the\r\nmere act of clasping a support. {75}\r\n\r\n[Picture: Fig. 4.  Solanum jasminoides.  A. Section of the petiole in its\r\n    ordinary state.  B. Section of the petiole some weeks after it had\r\n                   clasped a stick, as shown in fig. 2]\r\n\r\nFUMARIACEÆ.—_Fumaria officinalis_.—It could not have been anticipated\r\nthat so lowly a plant as this Fumaria should have been a climber.  It\r\nclimbs by the aid of the main and lateral petioles of its compound\r\nleaves; and even the much-flattened terminal portion of the petiole can\r\nseize a support.  I have seen a substance as soft as a withered blade of\r\ngrass caught.  Petioles which have clasped any object ultimately become\r\nrather thicker and more cylindrical.  On lightly rubbing several petioles\r\nwith a twig, they became perceptibly curved in 1 hr. 15 m., and\r\nsubsequently straightened themselves.  A stick gently placed in the angle\r\nbetween two sub-petioles excited them to move, and was almost clasped in\r\n9 hrs.  A loop of thread, weighing one-eighth of a grain, caused, after\r\n12 hrs. and before 20 hrs, had elapsed, a considerable curvature; but it\r\nwas never fairly clasped by the petiole.  The young internodes are in\r\ncontinual movement, which is considerable in extent, but very irregular;\r\na zigzag line, or a spire crossing itself; or a figure of 8 being formed.\r\nThe course during 12 hrs., when traced on a bell-glass, apparently\r\nrepresented about four ellipses.  The leaves themselves likewise move\r\nspontaneously, the main petioles curving themselves in accordance with\r\nthe movements of the internodes; so that when the latter moved to one\r\nside, the petioles moved to the same side, then, becoming straight,\r\nreversed their curvature.  The petioles, however, do not move over a wide\r\nspace, as could be seen when a shoot was securely tied to a stick.  The\r\nleaf in this case followed an irregular course, like that made by the\r\ninternodes.\r\n\r\n_Adlumia cirrhosa_.—I raised some plants late in the summer; they formed\r\nvery fine leaves, but threw up no central stem.  The first-formed leaves\r\nwere not sensitive; some of the later ones were so, but only towards\r\ntheir extremities, which were thus enabled to clasp sticks.  This could\r\nbe of no service to the plant, as these leaves rose from the ground; but\r\nit showed what the future character of the plant would have been, had it\r\ngrown tall enough to climb.  The tip of one of these basal leaves, whilst\r\nyoung, described in 1 hr. 36 m. a narrow ellipse, open at one end, and\r\nexactly three inches in length; a second ellipse was broader, more\r\nirregular, and shorter, viz., only 2½ inches in length, and was completed\r\nin 2 hrs. 2 m.  From the analogy of _Fumaria_ and _Corydalis_, I have no\r\ndoubt that the internodes of Adlumia have the power of revolving.\r\n\r\n_Corydalis claviculata_.—This plant is interesting from being in a\r\ncondition so exactly intermediate between a leaf-climber and a\r\ntendril-bearer, that it might have been described under either head; but,\r\nfor reasons hereafter assigned, it has been classed amongst\r\ntendril-bearers.\r\n\r\nBesides the plants already described, _Bignonia unguis_ and its close\r\nallies, though aided by tendrils, have clasping petioles.  According to\r\nMohl (p. 40), _Cocculus Japonicus_ (one of the Menispermaceæ) and a fern,\r\nthe _Ophioglossum Japonicum_ (p. 39), climb by their leaf-stalks.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWe now come to a small section of plants which climb by means of the\r\nproduced midribs or tips of their leaves.\r\n\r\nLILIACEÆ.—_Gloriosa Plantii_.—The stem of a half-grown plant continually\r\nmoved, generally describing an irregular spire, but sometimes oval\r\nfigures with the longer axes directed in different lines.  It either\r\nfollowed the sun, or moved in an opposite course, and sometimes stood\r\nstill before reversing its direction.  One oval was completed in 3 hrs.\r\n40 m.; of two horseshoe-shaped figures, one was completed in 4 hrs. 35 m.\r\nand the other in 3 hrs.  The shoots, in their movements, reached points\r\nbetween four and five inches asunder.  The young leaves, when first\r\ndeveloped, stand up nearly vertically; but by the growth of the axis, and\r\nby the spontaneous bending down of the terminal half of the leaf, they\r\nsoon become much inclined, and ultimately horizontal.  The end of the\r\nleaf forms a narrow, ribbon-like, thickened projection, which at first is\r\nnearly straight, but by the time the leaf gets into an inclined position,\r\nthe end bends downwards into a well-formed hook.  This hook is now strong\r\nand rigid enough to catch any object, and, when caught, to anchor the\r\nplant and stop the revolving movement.  Its inner surface is sensitive,\r\nbut not in nearly so high a degree as that of the many before-described\r\npetioles; for a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain, produced no effect.\r\nWhen the hook has caught a thin twig or even a rigid fibre, the point may\r\nbe perceived in from 1 hr. to 3 hrs. to have curled a little inwards;\r\nand, under favourable circumstances, it curls round and permanently\r\nseizes an object in from 8 hrs. to 10 hrs.  The hook when first formed,\r\nbefore the leaf has bent downwards, is but little sensitive.  If it\r\ncatches hold of nothing, it remains open and sensitive for a long time;\r\nultimately the extremity spontaneously and slowly curls inwards, and\r\nmakes a button-like, flat, spiral coil at the end of the leaf.  One leaf\r\nwas watched, and the hook remained open for thirty-three days; but during\r\nthe last week the tip had curled so much inwards that only a very thin\r\ntwig could have been inserted within it.  As soon as the tip has curled\r\nso much inwards that the hook is converted into a ring, its sensibility\r\nis lost; but as long as it remains open some sensibility is retained.\r\n\r\nWhilst the plant was only about six inches in height, the leaves, four or\r\nfive in number, were broader than those subsequently produced; their soft\r\nand but little-attenuated tips were not sensitive, and did not form\r\nhooks; nor did the stem then revolve.  At this early period of growth,\r\nthe plant can support itself; its climbing powers are not required, and\r\nconsequently are not developed.  So again, the leaves on the summit of a\r\nfull-grown flowering plant, which would not require to climb any higher,\r\nwere not sensitive and could not clasp a stick.  We thus see how perfect\r\nis the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nCOMMELYNACEÆ.—_Flagellaria Indica_.—From dried specimens it is manifest\r\nthat this plant climbs exactly like the _Gloriosa_.  A young plant 12\r\ninches in height, and bearing fifteen leaves, had not a single leaf as\r\nyet produced into a hook or tendril-like filament; nor did the stem\r\nrevolve.  Hence this plant acquires its climbing powers later in life\r\nthan does the _Gloriosa_ lily.  According to Mohl (p. 41), _Uvularia_\r\n(Melanthaceæ) also climbs like _Gloriosa_.\r\n\r\nThese three last-named genera are Monocotyledons; but there is one\r\nDicotyledon, namely _Nepenthes_, which is ranked by Mohl (p. 41) amongst\r\ntendril-bearers; and I hear from Dr. Hooker that most of the species\r\nclimb well at Kew.  This is effected by the stalk or midrib between the\r\nleaf and the pitcher coiling round any support.  The twisted part becomes\r\nthicker; but I observed in Mr. Veitch’s hothouse that the stalk often\r\ntakes a turn when not in contact with any object, and that this twisted\r\npart is likewise thickened.  Two vigorous young plants of _N. lævis_ and\r\n_N. distillatoria_, in my hothouse, whilst less than a foot in height,\r\nshowed no sensitiveness in their leaves, and had no power of climbing.\r\nBut when _N. lævis_ had grown to a height of 16 inches, there were signs\r\nof these powers.  The young leaves when first formed stand upright, but\r\nsoon become inclined; at this period they terminate in a stalk or\r\nfilament, with the pitcher at the extremity hardly at all developed.  The\r\nleaves now exhibited slight spontaneous movements; and when the terminal\r\nfilaments came into contact with a stick, they slowly bent round and\r\nfirmly seized it.  But owing to the subsequent growth of the leaf, this\r\nfilament became after a time quite slack, though still remaining firmly\r\ncoiled round the stick.  Hence it would appear that the chief use of the\r\ncoiling, at least whilst the plant is young, is to support the pitcher\r\nwith its load of secreted fluid.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n_Summary on Leaf-climbers_.—Plants belonging to eight families are known\r\nto have clasping petioles, and plants belonging to four families climb by\r\nthe tips of their leaves.  In all the species observed by me, with one\r\nexception, the young internodes revolve more or less regularly, in some\r\ncases as regularly as those of a twining plant.  They revolve at various\r\nrates, in most cases rather rapidly.  Some few can ascend by spirally\r\ntwining round a support.  Differently from most twiners, there is a\r\nstrong tendency in the same shoot to revolve first in one and then in an\r\nopposite direction.  The object gained by the revolving movement is to\r\nbring the petioles or the tips of the leaves into contact with\r\nsurrounding objects; and without this aid the plant would be much less\r\nsuccessful in climbing.  With rare exceptions, the petioles are sensitive\r\nonly whilst young.  They are sensitive on all sides, but in different\r\ndegrees in different plants; and in some species of _Clematis_ the\r\nseveral parts of the same petiole differ much in sensitiveness.  The\r\nhooked tips of the leaves of the _Gloriosa_ are sensitive only on their\r\ninner or inferior surfaces.  The petioles are sensitive to a touch and to\r\nexcessively slight continued pressure, even from a loop of soft thread\r\nweighing only the one-sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.); and there is\r\nreason to believe that the rather thick and stiff petioles of _Clematis\r\nflammula_ are sensitive to even much less weight if spread over a wide\r\nsurface.  The petioles always bend towards the side which is pressed or\r\ntouched, at different rates in different species, sometimes within a few\r\nminutes, but generally after a much longer period.  After temporary\r\ncontact with any object, the petiole continues to bend for a considerable\r\ntime; afterwards it slowly becomes straight again, and can then re-act.\r\nA petiole excited by an extremely slight weight sometimes bends a little,\r\nand then becomes accustomed to the stimulus, and either bends no more or\r\nbecomes straight again, the weight still remaining suspended.  Petioles\r\nwhich have clasped an object for some little time cannot recover their\r\noriginal position.  After remaining clasped for two or three days, they\r\ngenerally increase much in thickness either throughout their whole\r\ndiameter or on one side alone; they subsequently become stronger and more\r\nwoody, sometimes to a wonderful degree; and in some cases they acquire an\r\ninternal structure like that of the stem or axis.\r\n\r\nThe young internodes of the _Lophospermum_ as well as the petioles are\r\nsensitive to a touch, and by their combined movement seize an object.\r\nThe flower-peduncles of the _Maurandia semperflorens_ revolve\r\nspontaneously and are sensitive to a touch, yet are not used for\r\nclimbing.  The leaves of at least two, and probably of most, of the\r\nspecies of _Clematis_, of _Fumaria_ and _Adlumia_, spontaneously curve\r\nfrom side to side, like the internodes, and are thus better adapted to\r\nseize distant objects.  The petioles of the perfect leaves of _Tropæolum\r\ntricolorum_, as well as the tendril-like filaments of the plants whilst\r\nyoung, ultimately move towards the stem or the supporting stick, which\r\nthey then clasp.  These petioles and filaments also show some tendency to\r\ncontract spirally.  The tips of the uncaught leaves of the _Gloriosa_, as\r\nthey grow old, contract into a flat spire or helix.  These several facts\r\nare interesting in relation to true tendrils.\r\n\r\nWith leaf climbers, as with twining plants, the first internodes which\r\nrise from the ground do not, at least in the cases observed by me,\r\nspontaneously revolve; nor are the petioles or tips of the first-formed\r\nleaves sensitive.  In certain species of _Clematis_, the large size of\r\nthe leaves, together with their habit of revolving, and the extreme\r\nsensitiveness of their petioles, appear to render the revolving movement\r\nof the internodes superfluous; and this latter power has consequently\r\nbecome much enfeebled.  In certain species of _Tropæolum_, both the\r\nspontaneous movements of the internodes and the sensitiveness of the\r\npetioles have become much enfeebled, and in one species have been\r\ncompletely lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTENDRIL-BEARERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of tendrils—BIGNONIACEÆ, various species of, and their different\r\nmodes of climbing—Tendrils which avoid the light and creep into\r\ncrevices—Development of adhesive discs—Excellent adaptations for seizing\r\ndifferent kinds of supports.—POLEMONIACEÆ—_Cobæa scandens_ much branched\r\nand hooked tendrils, their manner of\r\naction—LEGUMINOSÆ—COMPOSITÆ—SMILACEÆ—_Smilax aspera_, its inefficient\r\ntendrils—FUMARIACEÆ—_Corydalis claviculata_, its state intermediate\r\nbetween that of a leaf-climber and a tendril-bearer.\r\n\r\nBY tendrils I mean filamentary organs, sensitive to contact and used\r\nexclusively for climbing.  By this definition, spines, hooks and\r\nrootlets, all of which are used for climbing, are excluded.  True\r\ntendrils are formed by the modification of leaves with their petioles, of\r\nflower-peduncles, branches, {84} and perhaps stipules.  Mohl, who\r\nincludes under the name of tendrils various organs having a similar\r\nexternal appearance, classes them according to their homological nature,\r\nas being modified leaves, flower-peduncles, &c.  This would be an\r\nexcellent scheme; but I observe that botanists are by no means unanimous\r\non the homological nature of certain tendrils.  Consequently I will\r\ndescribe tendril-bearing plants by natural families, following Lindley’s\r\nclassification; and this will in most cases keep those of the same nature\r\ntogether.  The species to be described belong to ten families, and will\r\nbe given in the following order:—_Bignoniaceæ_, _Polemoniaceæ_,\r\n_Leguminosæ_, _Compositæ_, _Smilaceæ_, _Fumariaceæ_, _Cucurbitaceæ_,\r\n_Vitaceæ_, _Sapindaceæ_, _Passifloraceæ_. {85}\r\n\r\nBIGNONIACEÆ.—This family contains many tendril-bearers, some twiners, and\r\nsome root-climbers.  The tendrils always consist of modified leaves.\r\nNine species of _Bignonia_, selected by hazard, are here described, in\r\norder to show what diversity of structure and action there may be within\r\nthe same genus, and to show what remarkable powers some tendrils possess.\r\nThe species, taken together, afford connecting links between twiners,\r\nleaf-climbers, tendril-bearers, and root-climbers.\r\n\r\n         [Picture: Fig. 5.  Bignonia.  Unnamed species from Kew]\r\n\r\n_Bignonia_ (an unnamed species from Kew, closely allied to _B. unguis_,\r\nbut with smaller and rather broader leaves).—A young shoot from a\r\ncut-down plant made three revolutions against the sun, at an average rate\r\nof 2 hrs. 6 m.  The stem is thin and flexible; it twined round a slender\r\nvertical stick, ascending from left to right, as perfectly and as\r\nregularly as any true twining-plant.  When thus ascending, it makes no\r\nuse of its tendrils or petioles; but when it twined round a rather thick\r\nstick, and its petioles were brought into contact with it, these curved\r\nround the stick, showing that they have some degree of irritability.  The\r\npetioles also exhibit a slight degree of spontaneous movement; for in one\r\ncase they certainly described minute, irregular, vertical ellipses.  The\r\ntendrils apparently curve themselves spontaneously to the same side with\r\nthe petioles; but from various causes, it was difficult to observe the\r\nmovement of either the tendrils or petioles, in this and the two\r\nfollowing species.  The tendrils are so closely similar in all respects\r\nto those of _B. unguis_, that one description will suffice.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia unguis_.—The young shoots revolve, but less regularly and less\r\nquickly than those of the last species.  The stem twines imperfectly\r\nround a vertical stick, sometimes reversing its direction, in the same\r\nmanner as described in so many leaf-climbers; and this plant though\r\npossessing tendrils, climbs to a certain extent like a leaf-climber.\r\nEach leaf consists of a petiole bearing a pair of leaflets, and\r\nterminates in a tendril, which is formed by the modification of three\r\nleaflets, and closely resembles that above figured (fig. 5).  But it is a\r\nlittle larger, and in a young plant was about half an inch in length.  It\r\nis curiously like the leg and foot of a small bird, with the hind toe cut\r\noff.  The straight leg or tarsus is longer than the three toes, which are\r\nof equal length, and diverging, lie in the same plane.  The toes\r\nterminate in sharp, hard claws, much curved downwards, like those on a\r\nbird’s foot.  The petiole of the leaf is sensitive to contact; even a\r\nsmall loop of thread suspended for two days caused it to bend upwards;\r\nbut the sub-petioles of the two lateral leaflets are not sensitive.  The\r\nwhole tendril, namely, the tarsus and the three toes, are likewise\r\nsensitive to contact, especially on their under surfaces.  When a shoot\r\ngrows in the midst of thin branches, the tendrils are soon brought by the\r\nrevolving movement of the internodes into contact with them; and then one\r\ntoe of the tendril or more, commonly all three, bend, and after several\r\nhours seize fast hold of the twigs, like a bird when perched.  If the\r\ntarsus of the tendril comes into contact with a twig, it goes on slowly\r\nbending, until the whole foot is carried quite round, and the toes pass\r\non each side of the tarsus and seize it.  In like manner, if the petiole\r\ncomes into contact with a twig, it bends round, carrying the tendril,\r\nwhich then seizes its own petiole or that of the opposite leaf.  The\r\npetioles move spontaneously, and thus, when a shoot attempts to twine\r\nround an upright stick, those on both sides after a time come into\r\ncontact with it, and are excited to bend.  Ultimately the two petioles\r\nclasp the stick in opposite directions, and the foot-like tendrils,\r\nseizing on each other or on their own petioles, fasten the stem to the\r\nsupport with surprising security.  The tendrils are thus brought into\r\naction, if the stem twines round a thin vertical stick; and in this\r\nrespect the present species differs from the last.  Both species use\r\ntheir tendrils in the same manner when passing through a thicket.  This\r\nplant is one of the most efficient climbers which I have observed; and it\r\nprobably could ascend a polished stem incessantly tossed by heavy storms.\r\nTo show how important vigorous health is for the action of all the parts,\r\nI may mention that when I first examined a plant which was growing\r\nmoderately well, though not vigorously, I concluded that the tendrils\r\nacted only like the hooks on a bramble, and that it was the most feeble\r\nand inefficient of all climbers!\r\n\r\n_Bignonia Tweedyana_.—This species is closely allied to the last, and\r\nbehaves in the same manner; but perhaps twines rather better round a\r\nvertical stick.  On the same plant, one branch twined in one direction\r\nand another in an opposite direction.  The internodes in one case made\r\ntwo circles, each in 2 hrs. 33 m.  I was enabled to observe the\r\nspontaneous movements of the petioles better in this than in the two\r\npreceding species: one petiole described three small vertical ellipses in\r\nthe course of 11 hrs., whilst another moved in an irregular spire.  Some\r\nlittle time after a stem has twined round an upright stick, and is\r\nsecurely fastened to it by the clasping petioles and tendrils, it emits\r\naërial roots from the bases of its leaves; and these roots curve partly\r\nround and adhere to the stick.  This species of _Bignonia_, therefore,\r\ncombines four different methods of climbing generally characteristic of\r\ndistinct plants, namely, twining, leaf-climbing, tendril-climbing, and\r\nroot-climbing.\r\n\r\nIn the three foregoing species, when the foot-like tendril has caught an\r\nobject, it continues to grow and thicken, and ultimately becomes\r\nwonderfully strong, in the same manner as the petioles of leaf-climbers.\r\nIf the tendril catches nothing, it first slowly bends downwards, and then\r\nits power of clasping is lost.  Very soon afterwards it disarticulates\r\nitself from the petiole, and drops off like a leaf in autumn.  I have\r\nseen this process of disarticulation in no other tendrils, for these,\r\nwhen they fail to catch an object, merely wither away.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia venusta_.—The tendrils differ considerably from those of the\r\nprevious species.  The lower part, or tarsus, is four times as long as\r\nthe three toes; these are of equal length and diverge equally, but do not\r\nlie in the same plane; their tips are bluntly hooked, and the whole\r\ntendril makes an excellent grapnel.  The tarsus is sensitive on all\r\nsides; but the three toes are sensitive only on their outer surfaces.\r\nThe sensitiveness is not much developed; for a slight rubbing with a twig\r\ndid not cause the tarsus or the toes to become curved until an hour had\r\nelapsed, and then only in a slight degree.  Subsequently they\r\nstraightened themselves.  Both the tarsus and toes can seize well hold of\r\nsticks.  If the stem is secured, the tendrils are seen spontaneously to\r\nsweep large ellipses; the two opposite tendrils moving independently of\r\none another.  I have no doubt, from the analogy of the two following\r\nallied species, that the petioles also move spontaneously; but they are\r\nnot irritable like those of _B. unguis_ and _B. Tweedyana_.  The young\r\ninternodes sweep large circles, one being completed in 2 hrs. 15 m., and\r\na second in 2 hrs. 55 m.  By these combined movements of the internodes,\r\npetioles, and grapnel-like tendrils, the latter are soon brought into\r\ncontact with surrounding objects.  When a shoot stands near an upright\r\nstick, it twines regularly and spirally round it.  As it ascends, it\r\nseizes the stick with one of its tendrils, and, if the stick be thin, the\r\nright—and left-hand tendrils are alternately used.  This alternation\r\nfollows from the stem necessarily taking one twist round its own axis for\r\neach completed circle.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils contract spirally a short time after catching any object;\r\nthose which catch nothing merely bend slowly downwards.  But the whole\r\nsubject of the spiral contraction of tendrils will be discussed after all\r\nthe tendril-bearing species have been described.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia littoralis_.—The young internodes revolve in large ellipses.\r\nAn internode bearing immature tendrils made two revolutions, each in 3\r\nhrs. 50 m.; but when grown older with the tendrils mature, it made two\r\nellipses, each at the rate of 2 hrs. 44 m.  This species, unlike the\r\npreceding, is incapable of twining round a stick: this does not appear to\r\nbe due to any want of flexibility in the internodes or to the action of\r\nthe tendrils, and certainly not to any want of the revolving power; nor\r\ncan I account for the fact.  Nevertheless the plant readily ascends a\r\nthin upright stick by seizing a point above with its two opposite\r\ntendrils, which then contract spirally.  If the tendrils seize nothing,\r\nthey do not become spiral.\r\n\r\nThe species last described, ascended a vertical stick by twining spirally\r\nand by seizing it alternately with its opposite tendrils, like a sailor\r\npulling himself up a rope, hand over hand; the present species pulls\r\nitself up, like a sailor seizing with both hands together a rope above\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils are similar in structure to those of the last species.  They\r\ncontinue growing for some time, even after they have clasped an object.\r\nWhen fully grown, though borne by a young plant, they are 9 inches in\r\nlength.  The three divergent toes are shorter relatively to the tarsus\r\nthan in the former species; they are blunt at their tips and but slightly\r\nhooked; they are not quite equal in length, the middle one being rather\r\nlonger than the others.  Their outer surfaces are highly sensitive; for\r\nwhen lightly rubbed with a twig, they became perceptibly curved in 4 m.\r\nand greatly curved in 7 m.  In 7 hrs. they became straight again and were\r\nready to re-act.  The tarsus, for the space of one inch close to the\r\ntoes, is sensitive, but in a rather less degree than the toes; for the\r\nlatter after a slight rubbing, became curved in about half the time.\r\nEven the middle part of the tarsus is sensitive to prolonged contact, as\r\nsoon as the tendril has arrived at maturity.  After it has grown old, the\r\nsensitiveness is confined to the toes, and these are only able to curl\r\nvery slowly round a stick.  A tendril is perfectly ready to act, as soon\r\nas the three toes have diverged, and at this period their outer surfaces\r\nfirst become irritable.  The irritability spreads but little from one\r\npart when excited to another: thus, when a stick was caught by the part\r\nimmediately beneath the three toes, these seldom clasped it, but remained\r\nsticking straight out.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils revolve spontaneously.  The movement begins before the\r\ntendril is converted into a three-pronged grapnel by the divergence of\r\nthe toes, and before any part has become sensitive; so that the revolving\r\nmovement is useless at this early period.  The movement is, also, now\r\nslow, two ellipses being completed conjointly in 24 hrs. 18 m.  A mature\r\ntendril made an ellipse in 6 hrs.; so that it moved much more slowly than\r\nthe internodes.  The ellipses which were swept, both in a vertical and\r\nhorizontal plane, were of large size.  The petioles are not in the least\r\nsensitive, but revolve like the tendrils.  We thus see that the young\r\ninternodes, the petioles, and the tendrils all continue revolving\r\ntogether, but at different rates.  The movements of the tendrils which\r\nrise opposite one another are quite independent.  Hence, when the whole\r\nshoot is allowed freely to revolve, nothing can be more intricate than\r\nthe course followed by the extremity of each tendril.  A wide space is\r\nthus irregularly searched for some object to be grasped.\r\n\r\nOne other curious point remains to be mentioned.  In the course of a few\r\ndays after the toes have closely clasped a stick, their blunt extremities\r\nbecome developed, though not invariably, into irregular disc-like balls\r\nwhich have the power of adhering firmly to the wood.  As similar cellular\r\noutgrowths will be fully described under _B. capreolata_, I will here say\r\nnothing more about them.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia æquinoctialis_, var. _Chamberlaynii_.—The internodes, the\r\nelongated non-sensitive petioles, and the tendrils all revolve.  The stem\r\ndoes not twine, but ascends a vertical stick in the same manner as the\r\nlast species.  The tendrils also resemble those of the last species, but\r\nare shorter; the three toes are more unequal in length, the two outer\r\nones being about one-third shorter and rather thinner than the middle\r\ntoe; but they vary in this respect.  They terminate in small hard points;\r\nand what is important, cellular adhesive discs are not developed.  The\r\nreduced size of two of the toes as well as their lessened sensitiveness,\r\nseem to indicate a tendency to abortion; and on one of my plants the\r\nfirst-formed tendrils were sometimes simple, that is, were not divided\r\ninto three toes.  We are thus naturally led to the three following\r\nspecies with undivided tendrils:—\r\n\r\n_Bignonia speciosa_.—The young shoots revolve irregularly, making narrow\r\nellipses, spires or circles, at rates varying from 3 hrs. 30 m. to 4 hrs.\r\n40 m.; but they show no tendency to twine.  Whilst the plant is young and\r\ndoes not require a support, tendrils are not developed.  Those borne by a\r\nmoderately young plant were five inches in length.  They revolve\r\nspontaneously, as do the short and non-sensitive petioles.  When rubbed,\r\nthey slowly bend to the rubbed side and subsequently straighten\r\nthemselves; but they are not highly sensitive.  There is something\r\nstrange in their behaviour: I repeatedly placed close to them, thick and\r\nthin, rough and smooth sticks and posts, as well as string suspended\r\nvertically, but none of these objects were well seized.  After clasping\r\nan upright stick, they repeatedly loosed it again, and often would not\r\nseize it at all, or their extremities did not coil closely round.  I have\r\nobserved hundreds of tendrils belonging to various Cucurbitaceous,\r\nPassifloraceous, and Leguminous plants, and never saw one behave in this\r\nmanner.  When, however, my plant had grown to a height of eight or nine\r\nfeet, the tendrils acted much better.  They now seized a thin, upright\r\nstick horizontally, that is, at a point on their own level, and not some\r\nway up the stick as in the case of all the previous species.\r\nNevertheless, the non-twining stem was enabled by this means to ascend\r\nthe stick.\r\n\r\nThe extremity of the tendril is almost straight and sharp.  The whole\r\nterminal portion exhibits a singular habit, which in an animal would be\r\ncalled an instinct; for it continually searches for any little crevice or\r\nhole into which to insert itself.  I had two young plants; and, after\r\nhaving observed this habit, I placed near them posts, which had been\r\nbored by beetles, or had become fissured by drying.  The tendrils, by\r\ntheir own movement and by that of the internodes, slowly travelled over\r\nthe surface of the wood, and when the apex came to a hole or fissure it\r\ninserted itself; in order to effect this the extremity for a length of\r\nhalf or quarter of an inch, would often bend itself at right angles to\r\nthe basal part.  I have watched this process between twenty and thirty\r\ntimes.  The same tendril would frequently withdraw from one hole and\r\ninsert its point into a second hole.  I have also seen a tendril keep its\r\npoint, in one case for 20 hrs. and in another for 36 hrs., in a minute\r\nhole, and then withdraw it.  Whilst the point is thus temporarily\r\ninserted, the opposite tendril goes on revolving.\r\n\r\nThe whole length of a tendril often fits itself closely to any surface of\r\nwood with which it has come into contact; and I have observed one bent at\r\nright angles, from having entered a wide and deep fissure, with its apex\r\nabruptly re-bent and inserted into a minute lateral hole.  After a\r\ntendril has clasped a stick, it contracts spirally; if it remains\r\nunattached it hangs straight downwards.  If it has merely adapted itself\r\nto the inequalities of a thick post, though it has clasped nothing, or if\r\nit has inserted its apex into some little fissure, this stimulus suffices\r\nto induce spiral contraction; but the contraction always draws the\r\ntendril away from the post.  So that in every case these movements, which\r\nseem so nicely adapted for some purpose, were useless.  On one occasion,\r\nhowever, the tip became permanently jammed into a narrow fissure.  I\r\nfully expected, from the analogy of _B. capreolata_ and _B. littoralis_,\r\nthat the tips would have been developed into adhesive discs; but I could\r\nnever detect even a trace of this process.  There is therefore at present\r\nsomething unintelligible about the habits of this plant.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia picta_.—This species closely resembles the last in the\r\nstructure and movements of its tendrils.  I also casually examined a fine\r\ngrowing plant of the allied _B. Lindleyi_, and this apparently behaved in\r\nall respects in the same manner.\r\n\r\n_Bignonia capreolata_.—We now come to a species having tendrils of a\r\ndifferent type; but first for the internodes.  A young shoot made three\r\nlarge revolutions, following the sun, at an average rate of 2 hrs. 23 m.\r\nThe stem is thin and flexible, and I have seen one make four regular\r\nspiral turns round a thin upright stick, ascending of course from right\r\nto left, and therefore in a reversed direction compared with the before\r\ndescribed species.  Afterwards, from the interference of the tendrils, it\r\nascended either straight up the stick or in an irregular spire.  The\r\ntendrils are in some respects highly remarkable.  In a young plant they\r\nwere about 2½ inches in length and much branched, the five chief branches\r\napparently representing two pairs of leaflets and a terminal one.  Each\r\nbranch is, however, bifid or more commonly trifid towards the extremity,\r\nwith the points blunt yet distinctly hooked.  A tendril bends to any side\r\nwhich is lightly rubbed, and subsequently becomes straight again; but a\r\nloop of thread weighing ¼th of a grain produced no effect.  On two\r\noccasions the terminal branches became slightly curved in 10 m. after\r\nthey had touched a stick; and in 30 m. the tips were curled quite round\r\nit.  The basal part is less sensitive.  The tendrils revolved in an\r\napparently capricious manner, sometimes very slightly or not at all; at\r\nother times they described large regular ellipses.  I could detect no\r\nspontaneous movement in the petioles of the leaves.\r\n\r\nWhilst the tendrils are revolving more or less regularly, another\r\nremarkable movement takes place, namely, a slow inclination from the\r\nlight towards the darkest side of the house.  I repeatedly changed the\r\nposition of my plants, and some little time after the revolving movement\r\nhad ceased, the successively formed tendrils always ended by pointing to\r\nthe darkest side.  When I placed a thick post near a tendril, between it\r\nand the light, the tendril pointed in that direction.  In two instances a\r\npair of leaves stood so that one of the two tendrils was directed towards\r\nthe light and the other to the darkest side of the house; the latter did\r\nnot move, but the opposite one bent itself first upwards and then right\r\nover its fellow, so that the two became parallel, one above the other,\r\nboth pointing to the dark: I then turned the plant half round; and the\r\ntendril which had turned over recovered its original position, and the\r\nopposite one which had not before moved, now turned over to the dark\r\nside.  Lastly, on another plant, three pairs of tendrils were produced at\r\nthe same time by three shoots, and all happened to be differently\r\ndirected: I placed the pot in a box open only on one side, and obliquely\r\nfacing the light; in two days all six tendrils pointed with unerring\r\ntruth to the darkest corner of the box, though to do this each had to\r\nbend in a different manner.  Six wind-vanes could not have more truly\r\nshown the direction of the wind, than did these branched tendrils the\r\ncourse of the stream of light which entered the box.  I left these\r\ntendrils undisturbed for above 24 hrs., and then turned the pot half\r\nround; but they had now lost their power of movement, and could not any\r\nlonger avoid the light.\r\n\r\nWhen a tendril has not succeeded in clasping a support, either through\r\nits own revolving movement or that of the shoot, or by turning towards\r\nany object which intercepts the light, it bends vertically downwards and\r\nthen towards its own stem, which it seizes together with the supporting\r\nstick, if there be one.  A little aid is thus given in keeping the stem\r\nsecure.  If the tendril seizes nothing, it does not contract spirally,\r\nbut soon withers away and drops off.  If it seizes an object, all the\r\nbranches contract spirally.\r\n\r\nI have stated that after a tendril has come into contact with a stick, it\r\nbends round it in about half an hour; but I repeatedly observed, as in\r\nthe case of _B. speciosa_ and its allies, that it often again loosed the\r\nstick; sometimes seizing and loosing the same stick three or four times.\r\nKnowing that the tendrils avoided the light, I gave them a glass tube\r\nblackened within, and a well-blackened zinc plate: the branches curled\r\nround the tube and abruptly bent themselves round the edges of the zinc\r\nplate; but they soon recoiled from these objects with what I can only\r\ncall disgust, and straightened themselves.  I then placed a post with\r\nextremely rugged bark close to a pair of tendrils; twice they touched it\r\nfor an hour or two, and twice they withdrew; at last one of the hooked\r\nextremities curled round and firmly seized an excessively minute\r\nprojecting point of bark, and then the other branches spread themselves\r\nout, following with accuracy every inequality of the surface.  I\r\nafterwards placed near the plant a post without bark but much fissured,\r\nand the points of the tendrils crawled into all the crevices in a\r\nbeautiful manner.  To my surprise, I observed that the tips of the\r\nimmature tendrils, with the branches not yet fully separated, likewise\r\ncrawled just like roots into the minutest crevices.  In two or three days\r\nafter the tips had thus crawled into the crevices, or after their hooked\r\nends had seized minute points, the final process, now to be described,\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThis process I discovered by having accidentally left a piece of wool\r\nnear a tendril; and this led me to bind a quantity of flax, moss, and\r\nwool loosely round sticks, and to place them near tendrils.  The wool\r\nmust not be dyed, for these tendrils are excessively sensitive to some\r\npoisons.  The hooked points soon caught hold of the fibres, even loosely\r\nfloating fibres, and now there was no recoiling; on the contrary, the\r\nexcitement caused the hooks to penetrate the fibrous mass and to curl\r\ninwards, so that each hook caught firmly one or two fibres, or a small\r\nbundle of them.  The tips and the inner surfaces of the hooks now began\r\nto swell, and in two or three days were visibly enlarged.  After a few\r\nmore days the hooks were converted into whitish, irregular balls, rather\r\nabove the 0.05th of an inch (1.27 mm.) in diameter, formed of coarse\r\ncellular tissue, which sometimes wholly enveloped and concealed the hooks\r\nthemselves.  The surfaces of these balls secrete some viscid resinous\r\nmatter, to which the fibres of the flax, &c., adhere.  When a fibre has\r\nbecome fastened to the surface, the cellular tissue does not grow\r\ndirectly beneath it, but continues to grow closely on each side; so that\r\nwhen several adjoining fibres, though excessively thin, were caught, so\r\nmany crests of cellular matter, each not as thick as a human hair, grew\r\nup between them, and these, arching over on both sides, adhered firmly\r\ntogether.  As the whole surface of the ball continues to grow, fresh\r\nfibres adhere and are afterwards enveloped; so that I have seen a little\r\nball with between fifty and sixty fibres of flax crossing it at various\r\nangles and all embedded more or less deeply.  Every gradation in the\r\nprocess could be followed—some fibres merely sticking to the surface,\r\nothers lying in more or less deep furrows, or deeply embedded, or passing\r\nthrough the very centre of the cellular ball.  The embedded fibres are so\r\nclosely clasped that they cannot be withdrawn.  The outgrowing tissue has\r\nso strong a tendency to unite, that two balls produced by distinct\r\ntendrils sometimes unite and grow into a single one.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when a tendril had curled round a stick, half an inch in\r\ndiameter, an adhesive disc was formed; but this does not generally occur\r\nin the case of smooth sticks or posts.  If, however, the tip catches a\r\nminute projecting point, the other branches form discs, especially if\r\nthey find crevices to crawl into.  The tendrils failed to attach\r\nthemselves to a brick wall.\r\n\r\nI infer from the adherence of the fibres to the discs or balls, that\r\nthese secrete some resinous adhesive matter; and more especially from\r\nsuch fibres becoming loose if immersed in sulphuric ether.  This fluid\r\nlikewise removes small, brown, glistening points which can generally be\r\nseen on the surfaces of the older discs.  If the hooked extremities of\r\nthe tendrils do not touch anything, discs, as far as I have seen, are\r\nnever formed; {102} but temporary contact during a moderate time suffices\r\nto cause their development.  I have seen eight discs formed on the same\r\ntendril.  After their development the tendrils contract spirally, and\r\nbecome woody and very strong.  A tendril in this state supported nearly\r\nseven ounces, and would apparently have supported a considerably greater\r\nweight, had not the fibres of flax to which the discs were attached\r\nyielded.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts now given, we may infer that though the tendrils of this\r\nBignonia can occasionally adhere to smooth cylindrical sticks and often\r\nto rugged bark, yet that they are specially adapted to climb trees\r\nclothed with lichens, mosses, or other such productions; and I hear from\r\nProfessor Asa Gray that the _Polypodium incanum_ abounds on the\r\nforest-trees in the districts of North America where this species of\r\nBignonia grows.  Finally, I may remark how singular a fact it is that a\r\nleaf should be metamorphosed into a branched organ which turns from the\r\nlight, and which can by its extremities either crawl like roots into\r\ncrevices, or seize hold of minute projecting points, these extremities\r\nafterwards forming cellular outgrowths which secrete an adhesive cement,\r\nand then envelop by their continued growth the finest fibres.\r\n\r\n_Eccremocarpus scaber_ (_Bignoniaceæ_).—Plants, though growing pretty\r\nwell in my green-house, showed no spontaneous movements in their shoots\r\nor tendrils; but when removed to the hot-house, the young internodes\r\nrevolved at rates varying from 3 hrs. 15 m. to 1 hr. 13 m.  One large\r\ncircle was swept at this latter unusually quick rate; but generally the\r\ncircles or ellipses were small, and sometimes the course pursued was\r\nquite irregular.  An internode, after making several revolutions,\r\nsometimes stood still for 12 hrs. or 18 hrs., and then recommenced\r\nrevolving.  Such strongly marked interruptions in the movements of the\r\ninternodes I have observed in hardly any other plant.\r\n\r\nThe leaves bear four leaflets, themselves subdivided, and terminate in\r\nmuch-branched tendrils.  The main petiole of the leaf, whilst young,\r\nmoves spontaneously, and follows nearly the same irregular course and at\r\nabout the same rate as the internodes.  The movement to and from the stem\r\nis the most conspicuous, and I have seen the chord of a curved petiole\r\nwhich formed an angle of 59° with the stem, in an hour afterwards making\r\nan angle of 106°.  The two opposite petioles do not move together, and\r\none is sometimes so much raised as to stand close to the stem, whilst the\r\nother is not far from horizontal.  The basal part of the petiole moves\r\nless than the distal part.  The tendrils, besides being carried by the\r\nmoving petioles and internodes, themselves move spontaneously; and the\r\nopposite tendrils occasionally move in opposite directions.  By these\r\ncombined movements of the young internodes, petioles, and tendrils, a\r\nconsiderable space is swept in search of a support.\r\n\r\nIn young plants the tendrils are about three inches in length: they bear\r\ntwo lateral and two terminal branches; and each branch bifurcates twice,\r\nwith the tips terminating in blunt double hooks, having both points\r\ndirected to the same side.  All the branches are sensitive on all sides;\r\nand after being lightly rubbed, or after coming into contact with a\r\nstick, bend in about 10 m.  One which had become curved in 10 m. after a\r\nlight rub, continued bending for between 3 hrs. and 4 hrs., and became\r\nstraight again in 8 hrs. or 9 hrs.  Tendrils, which have caught nothing,\r\nultimately contract into an irregular spire, as they likewise do, only\r\nmuch more quickly, after clasping a support.  In both cases the main\r\npetiole bearing the leaflets, which is at first straight and inclined a\r\nlittle upwards, moves downwards, with the middle part bent abruptly into\r\na right angle; but this is seen in _E. miniatus_ more plainly than in _E.\r\nscaber_.  The tendrils in this genus act in some respects like those of\r\n_Bignonia capreolata_; but the whole does not move from the light, nor do\r\nthe hooked tips become enlarged into cellular discs.  After the tendrils\r\nhave come into contact with a moderately thick cylindrical stick or with\r\nrugged bark, the several branches may be seen slowly to lift themselves\r\nup, change their positions, and again come into contact with the\r\nsupporting surface.  The object of these movements is to bring the\r\ndouble-hooks at the extremities of the branches, which naturally face in\r\nall directions, into contact with the wood.  I have watched a tendril,\r\nhalf of which had bent itself at right angles round the sharp corner of a\r\nsquare post, neatly bring every single hook into contact with both\r\nrectangular surfaces.  The appearance suggested the belief, that though\r\nthe whole tendril is not sensitive to light, yet that the tips are so,\r\nand that they turn and twist themselves towards any dark surface.\r\nUltimately the branches arrange themselves very neatly to all the\r\nirregularities of the most rugged bark, so that they resemble in their\r\nirregular course a river with its branches, as engraved on a map.  But\r\nwhen a tendril has wound round a rather thick stick, the subsequent\r\nspiral contraction generally draws it away and spoils the neat\r\narrangement.  So it is, but not in quite so marked a manner, when a\r\ntendril has spread itself over a large, nearly flat surface of rugged\r\nbark.  We may therefore conclude that these tendrils are not perfectly\r\nadapted to seize moderately thick sticks or rugged bark.  If a thin stick\r\nor twig is placed near a tendril, the terminal branches wind quite round\r\nit, and then seize their own lower branches or the main stem.  The stick\r\nis thus firmly, but not neatly, grasped.  What the tendrils are really\r\nadapted for, appears to be such objects as the thin culms of certain\r\ngrasses, or the long flexible bristles of a brush, or thin rigid leaves\r\nsuch as those of the Asparagus, all of which they seize in an admirable\r\nmanner.  This is due to the extremities of the branches close to the\r\nlittle hooks being extremely sensitive to a touch from the thinnest\r\nobject, which they consequently curl round and clasp.  When a small\r\nbrush, for instance, was placed near a tendril, the tips of each\r\nsub-branch seized one, two, or three of the bristles; and then the spiral\r\ncontraction of the several branches brought all these little parcels\r\nclose together, so that thirty or forty bristles were drawn into a single\r\nbundle, which afforded an excellent support.\r\n\r\nPOLEMONIACEÆ.—_Cobæa scandens_.—This is an excellently constructed\r\nclimber.  The tendrils on a fine plant were eleven inches long, with the\r\npetiole bearing two pairs of leaflets, only two and a half inches in\r\nlength.  They revolve more rapidly and vigorously than those of any other\r\ntendril-bearer observed by me, with the exception of one kind of\r\nPassiflora.  Three large, nearly circular sweeps, directed against the\r\nsun were completed, each in 1 hr. 15 m.; and two other circles in 1 hr.\r\n20 m. and 1 hr. 23 m.  Sometimes a tendril travels in a much inclined\r\nposition, and sometimes nearly upright.  The lower part moves but little\r\nand the petiole not at all; nor do the internodes revolve; so that here\r\nwe have the tendril alone moving.  On the other hand, with most of the\r\nspecies of _Bignonia_ and the _Eccremocarpus_, the internodes, tendrils,\r\nand petioles all revolved.  The long, straight, tapering main stem of the\r\ntendril of the _Cobæa_ bears alternate branches; and each branch is\r\nseveral times divided, with the finer branches as thin as very thin\r\nbristles and extremely flexible, so that they are blown about by a breath\r\nof air; yet they are strong and highly elastic.  The extremity of each\r\nbranch is a little flattened, and terminates in a minute double (though\r\nsometimes single) hook, formed of a hard, translucent, woody substance,\r\nand as sharp as the finest needle.  On a tendril which was eleven inches\r\nlong I counted ninety-four of these beautifully constructed little hooks.\r\nThey readily catch soft wood, or gloves, or the skin of the naked hand.\r\nWith the exception of these hardened hooks, and of the basal part of the\r\ncentral stem, every part of every branchlet is highly sensitive on all\r\nsides to a slight touch, and bends in a few minutes towards the touched\r\nside.  By lightly rubbing several sub-branches on opposite sides, the\r\nwhole tendril rapidly assumed an extraordinarily crooked shape.  These\r\nmovements from contact do not interfere with the ordinary revolving\r\nmovement.  The branches, after becoming greatly curved from being\r\ntouched, straighten themselves at a quicker rate than in almost any other\r\ntendril seen by me, namely, in between half an hour and an hour.  After\r\nthe tendril has caught any object, spiral contraction likewise begins\r\nafter an unusually short interval of time, namely, in about twelve hours.\r\n\r\nBefore the tendril is mature, the terminal branchlets cohere, and the\r\nhooks are curled closely inwards.  At this period no part is sensitive to\r\na touch; but as soon as the branches diverge and the hooks stand out,\r\nfull sensitiveness is acquired.  It is a singular circumstance that\r\nimmature tendrils revolve at their full velocity before they become\r\nsensitive, but in a useless manner, as in this state they can catch\r\nnothing.  This want of perfect co-adaptation, though only for a short\r\ntime, between the structure and the functions of a climbing-plant is a\r\nrare event.  A tendril, as soon as it is ready to act, stands, together\r\nwith the supporting petiole, vertically upwards.  The leaflets borne by\r\nthe petiole are at this time quite small, and the extremity of the\r\ngrowing stem is bent to one side so as to be out of the way of the\r\nrevolving tendril, which sweeps large circles directly over head.  The\r\ntendrils thus revolve in a position well adapted for catching objects\r\nstanding above; and by this means the ascent of the plant is favoured.\r\nIf no object is caught, the leaf with its tendril bends downwards and\r\nultimately assumes a horizontal position.  An open space is thus left for\r\nthe next succeeding and younger tendril to stand vertically upwards and\r\nto revolve freely.  As soon as an old tendril bends downwards, it loses\r\nall power of movement, and contracts spirally into an entangled mass.\r\nAlthough the tendrils revolve with unusual rapidity, the movement lasts\r\nfor only a short time.  In a plant placed in the hot-house and growing\r\nvigorously, a tendril revolved for not longer than 36 hours, counting\r\nfrom the period when it first became sensitive; but during this period it\r\nprobably made at least 27 revolutions.\r\n\r\nWhen a revolving tendril strikes against a stick, the branches quickly\r\nbend round and clasp it.  The little hooks here play an important part,\r\nas they prevent the branches from being dragged away by the rapid\r\nrevolving movement, before they have had time to clasp the stick\r\nsecurely.  This is especially the case when only the extremity of a\r\nbranch has caught hold of a support.  As soon as a tendril has bent a\r\nsmooth stick or a thick rugged post, or has come into contact with planed\r\nwood (for it can adhere temporarily even to so smooth a surface as this),\r\nthe same peculiar movements may be observed as those described under\r\n_Bignonia capreolata_ and _Eccremocarpus_.  The branches repeatedly lift\r\nthemselves up and down; those which have their hooks already directed\r\ndownwards remaining in this position and securing the tendril, whilst the\r\nothers twist about until they succeed in arranging themselves in\r\nconformity with every irregularity of the surface, and in bringing their\r\nhooks into contact with the wood.  The use of the hooks was well shown by\r\ngiving the tendrils tubes and slips of glass to catch; for these, though\r\ntemporarily seized, were invariably lost, either during the\r\nre-arrangement of the branches or ultimately when spiral contraction\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nThe perfect manner in which the branches arranged themselves, creeping\r\nlike rootlets over every inequality of the surface and into any deep\r\ncrevice, is a pretty sight; for it is perhaps more effectually performed\r\nby this than by any other species.  The action is certainly more\r\nconspicuous, as the upper surfaces of the main stem, as well as of every\r\nbranch to the extreme hooks, are angular and green, whilst the lower\r\nsurfaces are rounded and purple.  I was led to infer, as in former cases,\r\nthat a less amount of light guided these movements of the branches of the\r\ntendrils.  I made many trials with black and white cards and glass tubes\r\nto prove it, but failed from various causes; yet these trials\r\ncountenanced the belief.  As a tendril consists of a leaf split into\r\nnumerous segments, there is nothing surprising in all the segments\r\nturning their upper surfaces towards the light, as soon as the tendril is\r\ncaught and the revolving movement is arrested.  But this will not account\r\nfor the whole movement, for the segments actually bend or curve to the\r\ndark side besides turning round on their axes so that their upper\r\nsurfaces may face the light.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Cobæa_ grows in the open air, the wind must aid the extremely\r\nflexible tendrils in seizing a support, for I found that a mere breath\r\nsufficed to cause the extreme branches to catch hold by their hooks of\r\ntwigs, which they could not have reached by the revolving movement.  It\r\nmight have been thought that a tendril, thus hooked by the extremity of a\r\nsingle branch, could not have fairly grasped its support.  But several\r\ntimes I watched cases like the following: tendril caught a thin stick by\r\nthe hooks of one of its two extreme branches; though thus held by the\r\ntip, it still tried to revolve, bowing itself to all sides, and by this\r\nmovement the other extreme branch soon caught the stick.  The first\r\nbranch then loosed itself, and, arranging its hooks, again caught hold.\r\nAfter a time, from the continued movement of the tendril, the hooks of a\r\nthird branch caught hold.  No other branches, as the tendril then stood,\r\ncould possibly have touched the stick.  But before long the upper part of\r\nthe main stem began to contract into an open spire.  It thus dragged the\r\nshoot which bore the tendril towards the stick; and as the tendril\r\ncontinually tried to revolve, a fourth branch was brought into contact.\r\nAnd lastly, from the spiral contraction travelling down both the main\r\nstem and the branches, all of them, one after another, were ultimately\r\nbrought into contact with the stick.  They then wound themselves round it\r\nand round one another, until the whole tendril was tied together in an\r\ninextricable knot.  The tendrils, though at first quite flexible, after\r\nhaving clasped a support for a time, become more rigid and stronger than\r\nthey were at first.  Thus the plant is secured to its support in a\r\nperfect manner.\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOSÆ.—_Pisum sativum_.—The common pea was the subject of a valuable\r\nmemoir by Dutrochet, {111} who discovered that the internodes and\r\ntendrils revolve in ellipses.  The ellipses are generally very narrow,\r\nbut sometimes approach to circles.  I several times observed that the\r\nlonger axis slowly changed its direction, which is of importance, as the\r\ntendril thus sweeps a wider space.  Owing to this change of direction,\r\nand likewise to the movement of the stem towards the light, the\r\nsuccessive irregular ellipses generally form an irregular spire.  I have\r\nthought it worth while to annex a tracing of the course pursued by the\r\nupper internode (the movement of the tendril being neglected) of a young\r\nplant from 8.40 A.M. to 9.15 P.M.  The course was traced on a\r\nhemispherical glass placed over the plant, and the dots with figures give\r\nthe hours of observation; each dot being joined by a straight line.  No\r\ndoubt all the lines would have been curvilinear if the course had been\r\nobserved at much shorter intervals.  The extremity of the petiole, from\r\nwhich the young tendril arose, was two inches from the glass, so that if\r\na pencil two inches in length could have been affixed to the petiole, it\r\nwould have traced the annexed figure on the under side of the glass; but\r\nit must be remembered that the figure is reduced by one-half.  Neglecting\r\nthe first great sweep towards the light from the figure 1 to 2, the end\r\nof the petiole swept a space 4 inches across in one direction, and 3\r\ninches in another.  As a full-grown tendril is considerably above two\r\ninches in length, and as the tendril itself bends and revolves in harmony\r\nwith the internode, a considerably wider space is swept than is here\r\nrepresented on a reduced scale.  Dutrochet observed the completion of an\r\nellipse in 1 hr. 20 m.; and I saw one completed in 1 hr. 30 m.  The\r\ndirection followed is variable, either with or against the sun.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: Fig. 6.  Side of room with window] {113}\r\n\r\nDutrochet asserts that the petioles of the leaves spontaneously revolve,\r\nas well as the young internodes and tendrils; but he does not say that he\r\nsecured the internodes; when this was done, I could never detect any\r\nmovement in the petiole, except to and from the light.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils, on the other hand, when the internodes and petioles are\r\nsecured, describe irregular spires or regular ellipses, exactly like\r\nthose made by the internodes.  A young tendril, only 1⅛ of an inch in\r\nlength, revolved.  Dutrochet has shown that when a plant is placed in a\r\nroom, so that the light enters laterally, the internodes travel much\r\nquicker to the light than from it: on the other hand, he asserts that the\r\ntendril itself moves from the light towards the dark side of the room.\r\nWith due deference to this great observer, I think he was mistaken, owing\r\nto his not having secured the internodes.  I took a young plant with\r\nhighly sensitive tendrils, and tied the petiole so that the tendril alone\r\ncould move; it completed a perfect ellipse in 1 hr. 30 m.; I then turned\r\nthe plant partly round, but this made no change in the direction of the\r\nsucceeding ellipse.  The next day I watched a plant similarly secured\r\nuntil the tendril (which was highly sensitive) made an ellipse in a line\r\nexactly to and from the light; the movement was so great that the tendril\r\nat the two ends of its elliptical course bent itself a little beneath the\r\nhorizon, thus travelling more than 180 degrees; but the curvature was\r\nfully as great towards the light as towards the dark side of the room.  I\r\nbelieve Dutrochet was misled by not having secured the internodes, and by\r\nhaving observed a plant of which the internodes and tendrils no longer\r\ncurved in harmony together, owing to inequality of age.\r\n\r\nDutrochet made no observations on the sensitiveness of the tendrils.\r\nThese, whilst young and about an inch in length with the leaflets on the\r\npetiole only partially expanded, are highly sensitive; a single light\r\ntouch with a twig on the inferior or concave surface near the tip caused\r\nthem to bend quickly, as did occasionally a loop of thread weighing\r\none-seventh of a grain (9.25 mg.).  The upper or convex surface is barely\r\nor not at all sensitive.  Tendrils, after bending from a touch,\r\nstraighten themselves in about two hours, and are then ready to act\r\nagain.  As soon as they begin to grow old, the extremities of their two\r\nor three pairs of branches become hooked, and they then appear to form an\r\nexcellent grappling instrument; but this is not the case.  For at this\r\nperiod they have generally quite lost their sensitiveness; and when\r\nhooked on to twigs, some were not at all affected, and others required\r\nfrom 18 hrs. to 24 hrs. before clasping such twigs; nevertheless, they\r\nwere able to utilise the last vestige of irritability owing to their\r\nextremities being hooked.  Ultimately the lateral branches contract\r\nspirally, but not the middle or main stem.\r\n\r\n_Lathyrus aphaca_.—This plant is destitute of leaves, except during a\r\nvery early age, these being replaced by tendrils, and the leaves\r\nthemselves by large stipules.  It might therefore have been expected that\r\nthe tendrils would have been highly organized, but this is not so.  They\r\nare moderately long, thin, and unbranched, with their tips slightly\r\ncurved.  Whilst young they are sensitive on all sides, but chiefly on the\r\nconcave side of the extremity.  They have no spontaneous revolving power,\r\nbut are at first inclined upwards at an angle of about 45°, then move\r\ninto a horizontal position, and ultimately bend downwards.  The young\r\ninternodes, on the other hand, revolve in ellipses, and carry with them\r\nthe tendrils.  Two ellipses were completed, each in nearly 5 hrs.; their\r\nlonger axes were directed at about an angle of 45° to the axis of the\r\npreviously made ellipse.\r\n\r\n_Lathyrus grandiflorus_.—The plants observed were young and not growing\r\nvigorously, yet sufficiently so, I think, for my observations to be\r\ntrusted.  If so, we have the rare case of neither internodes nor tendrils\r\nrevolving.  The tendrils of vigorous plants are above 4 inches in length,\r\nand are often twice divided into three branches; the tips are curved and\r\nare sensitive on their concave sides; the lower part of the central stem\r\nis hardly at all sensitive.  Hence this plant appears to climb simply by\r\nits tendrils being brought, through the growth of the stem, or more\r\nefficiently by the wind, into contact with surrounding objects, which\r\nthey then clasp.  I may add that the tendrils, or the internodes, or\r\nboth, of _Vicia sativa_ revolve.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITÆ.—_Mutisia clematis_.—The immense family of the Compositæ is\r\nwell known to include very few climbing plants.  We have seen in the\r\nTable in the first chapter that _Mikania scandens_ is a regular twiner,\r\nand F. Müller informs me that in S. Brazil there is another species which\r\nis a leaf-climber.  _Mutisia_ is the only genus in the family, as far as\r\nI can learn, which bears tendrils: it is therefore interesting to find\r\nthat these, though rather less metamorphosed from their primordial foliar\r\ncondition than are most other tendrils, yet display all the ordinary\r\ncharacteristic movements, both those that are spontaneous and those which\r\nare excited by contact.\r\n\r\nThe long leaf bears seven or eight alternate leaflets, and terminates in\r\na tendril which, in a plant of considerable size, was 5 inches in length.\r\nIt consists generally of three branches; and these, although much\r\nelongated, evidently represent the petioles and midribs of three\r\nleaflets; for they closely resemble the same parts in an ordinary leaf,\r\nin being rectangular on the upper surface, furrowed, and edged with\r\ngreen.  Moreover, the green edging of the tendrils of young plants\r\nsometimes expands into a narrow lamina or blade.  Each branch is curved a\r\nlittle downwards, and is slightly hooked at the extremity.\r\n\r\nA young upper internode revolved, judging from three revolutions, at an\r\naverage rate of 1 hr. 38 m.; it swept ellipses with the longer axes\r\ndirected at right angles to one another; but the plant, apparently,\r\ncannot twine.  The petioles and the tendrils are both in constant\r\nmovement.  But their movement is slower and much less regularly\r\nelliptical than that of the internodes.  They appear to be much affected\r\nby the light, for the whole leaf usually sinks down during the night and\r\nrises during the day, moving, also, during the day in a crooked course to\r\nthe west.  The tip of the tendril is highly sensitive on the lower\r\nsurface; and one which was just touched with a twig became perceptibly\r\ncurved in 3 m., and another in 5 m.; the upper surface is not at all\r\nsensitive; the sides are moderately sensitive, so that two branches which\r\nwere rubbed on their inner sides converged and crossed each other.  The\r\npetiole of the leaf and the lower parts of the tendril, halfway between\r\nthe upper leaflet and the lowest branch, are not sensitive.  A tendril\r\nafter curling from a touch became straight again in about 6 hrs., and was\r\nready to re-act; but one that had been so roughly rubbed as to have\r\ncoiled into a helix did not become perfectly straight until after 13 hrs.\r\nThe tendrils retain their sensibility to an unusually late age; for one\r\nborne by a leaf with five or six fully developed leaves above, was still\r\nactive.  If a tendril catches nothing, after a considerable interval of\r\ntime the tips of the branches curl a little inwards; but if it clasps\r\nsome object, the whole contracts spirally.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Fig. 7.  Smilax aspera]\r\n\r\nSMILACEÆ.—_Smilax aspera_, var. _maculata_.—Aug. St.-Hilaire {118}\r\nconsiders that the tendrils, which rise in pairs from the petiole, are\r\nmodified lateral leaflets; but Mohl (p. 41) ranks them as modified\r\nstipules.  These tendrils are from 1½ to 1¾ inches in length, are thin,\r\nand have slightly curved, pointed extremities.  They diverge a little\r\nfrom each other, and stand at first nearly upright.  When lightly rubbed\r\non either side, they slowly bend to that side, and subsequently become\r\nstraight again.  The back or convex side when placed in contact with a\r\nstick became just perceptibly curved in 1 hr. 20 m., but did not\r\ncompletely surround it until 48 hrs. had elapsed; the concave side of\r\nanother became considerably curved in 2 hrs. and clasped a stick in 5\r\nhrs.  As the pairs of tendrils grow old, one tendril diverges more and\r\nmore from the other, and both slowly bend backwards and downwards, so\r\nthat after a time they project on the opposite side of the stem to that\r\nfrom which they arise.  They then still retain their sensitiveness, and\r\ncan clasp a support placed _behind_ the stem.  Owing to this power, the\r\nplant is able to ascend a thin upright stick.  Ultimately the two\r\ntendrils belonging to the same petiole, if they do not come into contact\r\nwith any object, loosely cross each other behind the stem, as at B, in\r\nfig. 7.  This movement of the tendrils towards and round the stem is, to\r\na certain extent, guided by their avoidance of the light; for when a\r\nplant stood so that one of the two tendrils was compelled in thus slowly\r\nmoving to travel towards the light, and the other from the light, the\r\nlatter always moved, as I repeatedly observed, more quickly than its\r\nfellow.  The tendrils do not contract spirally in any case.  Their chance\r\nof finding a support depends on the growth of the plant, on the wind, and\r\non their own slow backward and downward movement, which, as we have just\r\nseen, is guided, to a certain extent, by the avoidance of the light; for\r\nneither the internodes nor the tendrils have any proper revolving\r\nmovement.  From this latter circumstance, from the slow movements of the\r\ntendrils after contact (though their sensitiveness is retained for an\r\nunusual length of time), from their simple structure and shortness, this\r\nplant is a less perfect climber than any other tendril-bearing species\r\nobserved by me.  The plant whilst young and only a few inches in height,\r\ndoes not produce any tendrils; and considering that it grows to only\r\nabout 8 feet in height, that the stem is zigzag and is furnished, as well\r\nas the petioles, with spines, it is surprising that it should be provided\r\nwith tendrils, comparatively inefficient though these are.  The plant\r\nmight have been left, one would have thought, to climb by the aid of its\r\nspines alone, like our brambles.  As, however, it belongs to a genus,\r\nsome of the species of which are furnished with much longer tendrils, we\r\nmay suspect that it possesses these organs solely from being descended\r\nfrom progenitors more highly organized in this respect.\r\n\r\nFUMARIACEÆ.—_Corydalis claviculata_.—According to Mohl (p. 43), the\r\nextremities of the branched stem, as well as the leaves, are converted\r\ninto tendrils.  In the specimens examined by me all the tendrils were\r\ncertainly foliar, and it is hardly credible that the same plant should\r\nproduce tendrils of a widely different homological nature.  Nevertheless,\r\nfrom this statement by Mohl, I have ranked this species amongst the\r\ntendril-bearers; if classed exclusively by its foliar tendrils, it would\r\nbe doubtful whether it ought not to have been placed amongst the\r\nleaf-climbers, with its allies, _Fumaria_ and _Adlumia_.  A large\r\nmajority of its so-called tendrils still bear leaflets, though\r\nexcessively reduced in size; but some few of them may properly be\r\ndesignated as tendrils, for they are completely destitute of laminæ or\r\nblades.  Consequently, we here behold a plant in an actual state of\r\ntransition from a leaf-climber to a tendril-bearer.  Whilst the plant is\r\nrather young, only the outer leaves, but when full-grown all the leaves,\r\nhave their extremities converted into more or less perfect tendrils.  I\r\nhave examined specimens from one locality alone, viz. Hampshire; and it\r\nis not improbable that plants growing under different conditions might\r\nhave their leaves a little more or less changed into true tendrils.\r\n\r\nWhilst the plant is quite young, the first-formed leaves are not modified\r\nin any way, but those next formed have their terminal leaflets reduced in\r\nsize, and soon all the leaves assume the structure represented in the\r\nfollowing drawing.  This leaf bore nine leaflets; the lower ones being\r\nmuch subdivided.  The terminal portion of the petiole, about 1½ inch in\r\nlength (above the leaflet _f_), is thinner and more elongated than the\r\nlower part, and may be considered as the tendril.  The leaflets borne by\r\nthis part are greatly reduced in size, being, on an average, about the\r\ntenth of an inch in length and very narrow; one small leaflet measured\r\none-twelfth of an inch in length and one-seventy-fifth in breadth (2.116\r\nmm. and 0.339 mm.), so that it was almost microscopically minute.  All\r\nthe reduced leaflets have branching nerves, and terminate in little\r\nspines, like those of the fully developed leaflets.  Every gradation\r\ncould be traced, until we come to branchlets (as _a_ and _d_ in the\r\nfigure) which show no vestige of a lamina or blade.  Occasionally all the\r\nterminal branchlets of the petiole are in this condition, and we then\r\nhave a true tendril.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 8.  Corydalis claviculata.  Leaf-tendril of natural size]\r\n\r\nThe several terminal branches of the petiole bearing the much reduced\r\nleaflets (_a_, _b_, _c_, _d_) are highly sensitive, for a loop of thread\r\nweighing only the one-sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.) caused them to\r\nbecome greatly curved in under 4 hrs.  When the loop was removed, the\r\npetioles straightened themselves in about the same time.  The petiole\r\n(_e_) was rather less sensitive; and in another specimen, in which the\r\ncorresponding petiole bore rather larger leaflets, a loop of thread\r\nweighing one-eighth of a grain did not cause curvature until 18 hrs. had\r\nelapsed.  Loops of thread weighing one-fourth of a grain, left suspended\r\non the lower petioles (_f_ to _l_) during several days, produced no\r\neffect.  Yet the three petioles _f_, _g_, and _h_ were not quite\r\ninsensible, for when left in contact with a stick for a day or two they\r\nslowly curled round it.  Thus the sensibility of the petiole gradually\r\ndiminishes from the tendril-like extremity to the base.  The internodes\r\nof the stem are not at all sensitive, which makes Mohl’s statement that\r\nthey are sometimes converted into tendrils the more surprising, not to\r\nsay improbable.\r\n\r\nThe whole leaf, whilst young and sensitive, stands almost vertically\r\nupwards, as we have seen to be the case with many tendrils.  It is in\r\ncontinual movement, and one that I observed swept at an average rate of\r\nabout 2 hrs. for each revolution, large, though irregular, ellipses,\r\nwhich were sometimes narrow, sometimes broad, with their longer axes\r\ndirected to different points of the compass.  The young internodes,\r\nlikewise revolved irregularly in ellipses or spires; so that by these\r\ncombined movements a considerable space was swept for a support.  If the\r\nterminal and attenuated portion of a petiole fails to seize any object,\r\nit ultimately bends downwards and inwards, and soon loses all\r\nirritability and power of movement.  This bending down differs much in\r\nnature from that which occurs with the extremities of the young leaves in\r\nmany species of _Clematis_; for these, when thus bent downwards or\r\nhooked, first acquire their full degree of sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n_Dicentra thalictrifolia_.—In this allied plant the metamorphosis of the\r\nterminal leaflets is complete, and they are converted into perfect\r\ntendrils.  Whilst the plant is young, the tendrils appear like modified\r\nbranches, and a distinguished botanist thought that they were of this\r\nnature; but in a full-grown plant there can be no doubt, as I am assured\r\nby Dr. Hooker, that they are modified leaves.  When of full size, they\r\nare above 5 inches in length; they bifurcate twice, thrice, or even four\r\ntimes; their extremities are hooked and blunt.  All the branches of the\r\ntendrils are sensitive on all sides, but the basal portion of the main\r\nstem is only slightly so.  The terminal branches when lightly rubbed with\r\na twig became curved in the course of from 30 m. to 42 m., and\r\nstraightened themselves in between 10 hrs. and 20 hrs.  A loop of thread\r\nweighing one-eighth of a grain plainly caused the thinner branches to\r\nbend, as did occasionally a loop weighing one-sixteenth of a grain; but\r\nthis latter weight, though left suspended, was not sufficient to cause a\r\npermanent flexure.  The whole leaf with its tendril, as well as the young\r\nupper internodes, revolves vigorously and quickly, though irregularly,\r\nand thus sweeps a wide space.  The figure traced on a bell-glass was\r\neither an irregular spire or a zigzag line.  The nearest approach to an\r\nellipse was an elongated figure of 8, with one end a little open, and\r\nthis was completed in 1 hr. 53 m.  During a period of 6 hrs. 17 m.\r\nanother shoot made a complex figure, apparently representing three and a\r\nhalf ellipses.  When the lower part of the petiole bearing the leaflets\r\nwas securely fastened, the tendril itself described similar but much\r\nsmaller figures.\r\n\r\nThis species climbs well.  The tendrils after clasping a stick become\r\nthicker and more rigid; but the blunt hooks do not turn and adapt\r\nthemselves to the supporting surface, as is done in so perfect a manner\r\nby some Bignoniaceæ and Cobæa.  The tendrils of young plants, two or\r\nthree feet in height, are only half the length of those borne by the same\r\nplant when grown taller, and they do not contract spirally after clasping\r\na support, but only become slightly flexuous.  Full-sized tendrils, on\r\nthe other hand, contract spirally, with the exception of the thick basal\r\nportion.  Tendrils which have caught nothing simply bend downwards and\r\ninwards, like the extremities of the leaves of the _Corydalis\r\nclaviculata_.  But in all cases the petiole after a time is angularly and\r\nabruptly bent downwards like that of Eccremocarpus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTENDRIL-BEARERS—(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEÆ.—Homologous nature of the tendrils—_Echinocystis lobata_,\r\nremarkable movements of the tendrils to avoid seizing the terminal\r\nshoot—Tendrils not excited by contact with another tendril or by drops of\r\nwater—Undulatory movement of the extremity of the tendril—_Hanburya_,\r\nadherent discs—VITACÆ—Gradation between the flower-peduncles and tendrils\r\nof the vine—Tendrils of the Virginian Creeper turn from the light, and,\r\nafter contact, develop adhesive\r\ndiscs—SAPINDACEÆ—PASSIFLORACEÆ—_Passiflora gracilis_—Rapid revolving\r\nmovement and sensitiveness of the tendrils—Not sensitive to the contact\r\nof other tendrils or of drops of water—Spiral contraction of\r\ntendrils—Summary on the nature and action of tendrils.\r\n\r\nCUCURBITACEÆ.—The tendrils in this family have been ranked by competent\r\njudges as modified leaves, stipules, or branches; or as partly a leaf and\r\npartly a branch.  De Candolle believes that the tendrils differ in their\r\nhomological nature in two of the tribes. {127a}  From facts recently\r\nadduced, Mr. Berkeley thinks that Payer’s view is the most probable,\r\nnamely, that the tendril is “a separate portion of the leaf itself;” but\r\nmuch may be said in favour of the belief that it is a modified\r\nflower-peduncle. {127b}\r\n\r\n_Echinocystis lobata_.—Numerous observations were made on this plant\r\n(raised from seed sent me by Prof. Asa Gray), for the spontaneous\r\nrevolving movements of the internodes and tendrils were first observed by\r\nme in this case, and greatly perplexed me.  My observations may now be\r\nmuch condensed.  I observed thirty-five revolutions of the internodes and\r\ntendrils; the slowest rate was 2 hrs. and the average rate, with no great\r\nfluctuations, 1 hr. 40 m.  Sometimes I tied the internodes, so that the\r\ntendrils alone moved; at other times I cut off the tendrils whilst very\r\nyoung, so that the internodes revolved by themselves; but the rate was\r\nnot thus affected.  The course generally pursued was with the sun, but\r\noften in an opposite direction.  Sometimes the movement during a short\r\ntime would either stop or be reversed; and this apparently was due to\r\ninterference from the light, as, for instance, when I placed a plant\r\nclose to a window.  In one instance, an old tendril, which had nearly\r\nceased revolving, moved in one direction, whilst a young tendril above\r\nmoved in an opposite course.  The two uppermost internodes alone revolve;\r\nand as soon as the lower one grows old, only its upper part continues to\r\nmove.  The ellipses or circles swept by the summits of the internodes are\r\nabout three inches in diameter; whilst those swept by the tips of the\r\ntendrils, are from 15 to 16 inches in diameter.  During the revolving\r\nmovement, the internodes become successively curved to all points of the\r\ncompass; in one part of their course they are often inclined, together\r\nwith the tendrils, at about 45° to the horizon, and in another part stand\r\nvertically up.  There was something in the appearance of the revolving\r\ninternodes which continually gave the false impression that their\r\nmovement was due to the weight of the long and spontaneously revolving\r\ntendril; but, on cutting off the latter with sharp scissors, the top of\r\nthe shoot rose only a little, and went on revolving.  This false\r\nappearance is apparently due to the internodes and tendrils all curving\r\nand moving harmoniously together.\r\n\r\nA revolving tendril, though inclined during the greater part of its\r\ncourse at an angle of about 45° (in one case of only 37°) above the\r\nhorizon, stiffened and straightened itself from tip to base in a certain\r\npart of its course, thus becoming nearly or quite vertical.  I witnessed\r\nthis repeatedly; and it occurred both when the supporting internodes were\r\nfree and when they were tied up; but was perhaps most conspicuous in the\r\nlatter case, or when the whole shoot happened to be much inclined.  The\r\ntendril forms a very acute angle with the projecting extremity of the\r\nstem or shoot; and the stiffening always occurred as the tendril\r\napproached, and had to pass over the shoot in its circular course.  If it\r\nhad not possessed and exercised this curious power, it would infallibly\r\nhave struck against the extremity of the shoot and been arrested.  As\r\nsoon as the tendril with its three branches begins to stiffen itself in\r\nthis manner and to rise from an inclined into a vertical position, the\r\nrevolving motion becomes more rapid; and as soon as the tendril has\r\nsucceeded in passing over the extremity of the shoot or point of\r\ndifficulty, its motion, coinciding with that from its weight, often\r\ncauses it to fall into its previously inclined position so quickly, that\r\nthe apex could be seen travelling like the minute hand of a gigantic\r\nclock.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils are thin, from 7 to 9 inches in length, with a pair of short\r\nlateral branches rising not far from the base.  The tip is slightly and\r\npermanently curved, so as to act to a limited extent as a hook.  The\r\nconcave side of the tip is highly sensitive to a touch; but not so the\r\nconvex side, as was likewise observed to be the case with other species\r\nof the family by Mohl (p. 65).  I repeatedly proved this difference by\r\nlightly rubbing four or five times the convex side of one tendril, and\r\nonly once or twice the concave side of another tendril, and the latter\r\nalone curled inwards.  In a few hours afterwards, when the tendrils which\r\nhad been rubbed on the concave side had straightened themselves, I\r\nreversed the process of rubbing, and always with the same result.  After\r\ntouching the concave side, the tip becomes sensibly curved in one or two\r\nminutes; and subsequently, if the touch has been at all rough, it coils\r\nitself into a helix.  But the helix will, after a time, straighten\r\nitself, and be again ready to act.  A loop of thin thread only\r\none-sixteenth of a grain in weight caused a temporary flexure.  The lower\r\npart was repeatedly rubbed rather roughly, but no curvature ensued; yet\r\nthis part is sensitive to prolonged pressure, for when it came into\r\ncontact with a stick, it would slowly wind round it.\r\n\r\nOne of my plants bore two shoots near together, and the tendrils were\r\nrepeatedly drawn across one another, but it is a singular fact that they\r\ndid not once catch each other.  It would appear as if they had become\r\nhabituated to contact of this kind, for the pressure thus caused must\r\nhave been much greater than that caused by a loop of soft thread weighing\r\nonly the one-sixteenth of a grain.  I have, however, seen several\r\ntendrils of _Bryonia dioica_ interlocked, but they subsequently released\r\none another.  The tendrils of the Echinocystis are also habituated to\r\ndrops of water or to rain; for artificial rain made by violently flirting\r\na wet brush over them produced not the least effect.\r\n\r\nThe revolving movement of a tendril is not stopped by the curving of its\r\nextremity after it has been touched.  When one of the lateral branches\r\nhas firmly clasped an object, the middle branch continues to revolve.\r\nWhen a stem is bent down and secured, so that the tendril depends but is\r\nleft free to move, its previous revolving movement is nearly or quite\r\nstopped; but it soon begins to bend upwards, and as soon as it has become\r\nhorizontal the revolving movement recommences.  I tried this four times;\r\nthe tendril generally rose to a horizontal position in an hour or an hour\r\nand a half; but in one case, in which a tendril depended at an angle of\r\n45° beneath the horizon, the uprising took two hours; in half an hour\r\nafterwards it rose to 23° above the horizon and then recommenced\r\nrevolving.  This upward movement is independent of the action of light,\r\nfor it occurred twice in the dark, and on another occasion the light came\r\nin on one side alone.  The movement no doubt is guided by opposition to\r\nthe force of gravity, as in the case of the ascent of the plumules of\r\ngerminating seeds.\r\n\r\nA tendril does not long retain its revolving power; and as soon as this\r\nis lost, it bends downwards and contracts spirally.  After the revolving\r\nmovement has ceased, the tip still retains for a short time its\r\nsensitiveness to contact, but this can be of little or no use to the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThough the tendril is highly flexible, and though the extremity travels,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, at about the rate of an inch in two\r\nminutes and a quarter, yet its sensitiveness to contact is so great that\r\nit hardly ever fails to seize a thin stick placed in its path.  The\r\nfollowing case surprised me much: I placed a thin, smooth, cylindrical\r\nstick (and I repeated the experiment seven times) so far from a tendril,\r\nthat its extremity could only curl half or three-quarters round the\r\nstick; but I always found that the tip managed in the course of a few\r\nhours to curl twice or even thrice round the stick.  I at first thought\r\nthat this was due to rapid growth on the outside; but by coloured points\r\nand measurements I proved that there had been no sensible increase of\r\nlength within the time.  When a stick, flat on one side, was similarly\r\nplaced, the tip of the tendril could not curl beyond the flat surface,\r\nbut coiled itself into a helix, which, turning to one side, lay flat on\r\nthe little flat surface of wood.  In one instance a portion of tendril\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in length was thus dragged on to the flat\r\nsurface by the coiling in of the helix.  But the tendril thus acquires a\r\nvery insecure hold, and generally after a time slips off.  In one case\r\nalone the helix subsequently uncoiled itself, and the tip then passed\r\nround and clasped the stick.  The formation of the helix on the flat side\r\nof the stick apparently shows us that the continued striving of the tip\r\nto curl itself closely inwards gives the force which drags the tendril\r\nround a smooth cylindrical stick.  In this latter case, whilst the\r\ntendril was slowly and quite insensibly crawling onwards, I observed\r\nseveral times through a lens that the whole surface was not in close\r\ncontact with the stick; and I can understand the onward progress only by\r\nsupposing that the movement is slightly undulatory or vermicular, and\r\nthat the tip alternately straightens itself a little and then again curls\r\ninwards.  It thus drags itself onwards by an insensibly slow, alternate\r\nmovement, which may be compared to that of a strong man suspended by the\r\nends of his fingers to a horizontal pole, who works his fingers onwards\r\nuntil he can grasp the pole with the palm of his hand.  However this may\r\nbe, the fact is certain that a tendril which has caught a round stick\r\nwith its extreme point, can work itself onwards until it has passed twice\r\nor even thrice round the stick, and has permanently grasped it.\r\n\r\n_Hanburya Mexicana_.—The young internodes and tendrils of this anomalous\r\nmember of the family, revolve in the same manner and at about the same\r\nrate as those of the _Echinocystis_.  The stem does not twine, but can\r\nascend an upright stick by the aid of its tendrils.  The concave tip of\r\nthe tendril is very sensitive; after it had become rapidly coiled into a\r\nring owing to a single touch, it straightened itself in 50 m.  The\r\ntendril, when in full action, stands vertically up, with the projecting\r\nextremity of the young stem thrown a little on one side, so as to be out\r\nof the way; but the tendril bears on the inner side, near its base, a\r\nshort rigid branch, which projects out at right angles like a spur, with\r\nthe terminal half bowed a little downwards.  Hence, as the main vertical\r\nbranch revolves, the spur, from its position and rigidity, cannot pass\r\nover the extremity of the shoot, in the same curious manner as do the\r\nthree branches of the tendril of the _Echinocystis_, namely, by\r\nstiffening themselves at the proper point.  The spur is therefore pressed\r\nlaterally against the young stem in one part of the revolving course, and\r\nthus the sweep of the lower part of the main branch is much restricted.\r\nA nice case of co-adaptation here comes into play: in all the other\r\ntendrils observed by me, the several branches become sensitive at the\r\nsame period: had this been the case with the _Hanburya_, the inwardly\r\ndirected, spur-like branch, from being pressed, during the revolving\r\nmovement, against the projecting end of the shoot, would infallibly have\r\nseized it in a useless or injurious manner.  But the main branch of the\r\ntendril, after revolving for a time in a vertical position, spontaneously\r\nbends downwards; and in doing so, raises the spur-like branch, which\r\nitself also curves upwards; so that by these combined movements it rises\r\nabove the projecting end of the shoot, and can now move freely without\r\ntouching the shoot; and now it first becomes sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe tips of both branches, when they come into contact with a stick,\r\ngrasp it like any ordinary tendril.  But in the course of a few days, the\r\nlower surface swells and becomes developed into a cellular layer, which\r\nadapts itself closely to the wood, and firmly adheres to it.  This layer\r\nis analogous to the adhesive discs formed by the extremities of the\r\ntendrils of some species of _Bignonia_ and of _Ampelopsis_; but in the\r\n_Hanburya_ the layer is developed along the terminal inner surface,\r\nsometimes for a length of 1¾ inches, and not at the extreme tip.  The\r\nlayer is white, whilst the tendril is green, and near the tip it is\r\nsometimes thicker than the tendril itself; it generally spreads a little\r\nbeyond the sides of the tendril, and is fringed with free elongated\r\ncells, which have enlarged globular or retort-shaped heads.  This\r\ncellular layer apparently secretes some resinous cement; for its adhesion\r\nto the wood was not lessened by an immersion of 24 hrs. in alcohol or\r\nwater, but was quite loosened by a similar immersion in ether or\r\nturpentine.  After a tendril has once firmly coiled itself round a stick,\r\nit is difficult to imagine of what use the adhesive cellular layer can\r\nbe.  Owing to the spiral contraction which soon ensues, the tendrils were\r\nnever able to remain, excepting in one instance, in contact with a thick\r\npost or a nearly flat surface; if they had quickly become attached by\r\nmeans of the adhesive layer, this would evidently have been of service to\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils of _Bryonia dioica_, _Cucurbita ovifera_, and _Cucumis\r\nsativa_ are sensitive and revolve.  Whether the internodes likewise\r\nrevolve I did not observe.  In _Anguria Warscewiczii_, the internodes,\r\nthough thick and stiff, revolve: in this plant the lower surface of the\r\ntendril, some time after clasping a stick, produces a coarsely cellular\r\nlayer or cushion, which adapts itself closely to the wood, like that\r\nformed by the tendril of the _Hanburya_; but it is not in the least\r\nadhesive.  In _Zanonia Indica_, which belongs to a different tribe of the\r\nfamily, the forked tendrils and the internodes revolve in periods between\r\n2 hrs. 8 m. and 3 hrs. 35 m., moving against the sun.\r\n\r\nVITACEÆ.—In this family and in the two following, namely, the Sapindacæ\r\nand Passifloraceæ, the tendrils are modified flower-peduncles; and are\r\ntherefore axial in their nature.  In this respect they differ from all\r\nthose previously described, with the exception, perhaps, of the\r\nCucurbitaceæ.  The homological nature, however, of a tendril seems to\r\nmake no difference in its action.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: Fig. 9.  Tendril of the Vine.  A.  Peduncle of tendril.  B.\r\n    Longer Branch, with a scale at its base.  C.  Shorter branch.  D.\r\n                      Petiole of the opposite leaf]\r\n\r\n_Vitis vinifera_.—The tendril is thick and of great length; one from a\r\nvine growing out of doors and not vigorously, was 16 inches long.  It\r\nconsists of a peduncle (A), bearing two branches which diverge equally\r\nfrom it.  One of the branches (B) has a scale at its base; it is always,\r\nas far as I have seen, longer than the other and often bifurcates.  The\r\nbranches when rubbed become curved, and subsequently straighten\r\nthemselves.  After a tendril has clasped any object with its extremity,\r\nit contracts spirally; but this does not occur (Palm, p. 56) when no\r\nobject has been seized.  The tendrils move spontaneously from side to\r\nside; and on a very hot day, one made two elliptical revolutions, at an\r\naverage rate of 2 hrs. 15 m.  During these movements a coloured line,\r\npainted along the convex surface, appeared after a time on one side, then\r\non the concave side, then on the opposite side, and lastly again on the\r\nconvex side.  The two branches of the same tendril have independent\r\nmovements.  After a tendril has spontaneously revolved for a time, it\r\nbends from the light towards the dark: I do not state this on my own\r\nauthority, but on that of Mohl and Dutrochet.  Mohl (p. 77) says that in\r\na vine planted against a wall the tendrils point towards it, and in a\r\nvineyard generally more or less to the north.\r\n\r\nThe young internodes revolve spontaneously; but the movement is unusually\r\nslight.  A shoot faced a window, and I traced its course on the glass\r\nduring two perfectly calm and hot days.  On one of these days it\r\ndescribed, in the course of ten hours, a spire, representing two and a\r\nhalf ellipses.  I also placed a bell-glass over a young Muscat grape in\r\nthe hot-house, and it made each day three or four very small oval\r\nrevolutions; the shoot moving less than half an inch from side to side.\r\nHad it not made at least three revolutions whilst the sky was uniformly\r\novercast, I should have attributed this slight degree of movement to the\r\nvarying action of the light.  The extremity of the stem is more or less\r\nbent downwards, but it never reverses its curvature, as so generally\r\noccurs with twining plants.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 10.  Flower-stalk of the Vine.  A.  Common Peduncle.  B.\r\n Flower-tendril.  C.  Sub-Peduncle, bearing the flower-buds.  D.  Petiole\r\n                          of the opposite leaf]\r\n\r\nVarious authors (Palm, p. 55; Mohl, p. 45; Lindley, &c.) believe that the\r\ntendrils of the vine are modified flower-peduncles.  I here give a\r\ndrawing (fig. 10) of the ordinary state of a young flower-stalk: it\r\nconsists of the “common peduncle” (A); of the “flower-tendril” (B), which\r\nis represented as having caught a twig; and of the “sub-peduncle” (C)\r\nbearing the flower-buds.  The whole moves spontaneously, like a true\r\ntendril, but in a less degree; the movement, however, is greater when the\r\nsub-peduncle (C) does not bear many flower-buds.  The common peduncle (A)\r\nhas not the power of clasping a support, nor has the corresponding part\r\nof a true tendril.  The flower-tendril (B) is always longer than the\r\nsub-peduncle (C) and has a scale at its base; it sometimes bifurcates,\r\nand therefore corresponds in every detail with the longer scale-bearing\r\nbranch (B, fig.  9) of the true tendril.  It is, however, inclined\r\nbackwards from the sub-peduncle (C), or stands at right angles with it,\r\nand is thus adapted to aid in carrying the future bunch of grapes.  When\r\nrubbed, it curves and subsequently straightens itself; and it can, as is\r\nshown in the drawing, securely clasp a support.  I have seen an object as\r\nsoft as a young vine-leaf caught by one.\r\n\r\nThe lower and naked part of the sub-peduncle (C) is likewise slightly\r\nsensitive to a rub, and I have seen it bent round a stick and even partly\r\nround a leaf with which it had come into contact.  That the sub-peduncle\r\nhas the same nature as the corresponding branch of an ordinary tendril,\r\nis well shown when it bears only a few flowers; for in this case it\r\nbecomes less branched, increases in length, and gains both in\r\nsensitiveness and in the power of spontaneous movement.  I have twice\r\nseen sub-peduncles which bore from thirty to forty flower-buds, and which\r\nhad become considerably elongated and were completely wound round sticks,\r\nexactly like true tendrils.  The whole length of another sub-peduncle,\r\nbearing only eleven flower-buds, quickly became curved when slightly\r\nrubbed; but even this scanty number of flowers rendered the stalk less\r\nsensitive than the other branch, that is, the flower-tendril; for the\r\nlatter after a lighter rub became curved more quickly and in a greater\r\ndegree.  I have seen a sub-peduncle thickly covered with flower-buds,\r\nwith one of its higher lateral branchlets bearing from some cause only\r\ntwo buds; and this one branchlet had become much elongated and had\r\nspontaneously caught hold of an adjoining twig; in fact, it formed a\r\nlittle sub-tendril.  The increasing length of the sub-peduncle (C) with\r\nthe decreasing number of the flower-buds is a good instance of the law of\r\ncompensation.  In accordance with this same principle, the true tendril\r\nas a whole is always longer than the flower-stalk; for instance, on the\r\nsame plant, the longest flower-stalk (measured from the base of the\r\ncommon peduncle to the tip of the flower-tendril) was 8½ inches in\r\nlength, whilst the longest tendril was nearly double this length, namely\r\n16 inches.\r\n\r\nThe gradations from the ordinary state of a flower-stalk, as represented\r\nin the drawing (fig. 10), to that of a true tendril (fig. 9) are\r\ncomplete.  We have seen that the sub-peduncle (C), whilst still bearing\r\nfrom thirty to forty flower-buds, sometimes becomes a little elongated\r\nand partially assumes all the characters of the corresponding branch of a\r\ntrue tendril.  From this state we can trace every stage till we come to a\r\nfull-sized perfect tendril, bearing on the branch which corresponds with\r\nthe sub-peduncle one single flower-bud!  Hence there can be no doubt that\r\nthe tendril is a modified flower-peduncle.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of gradation well deserves notice.  Flower-tendrils (B, fig.\r\n10) sometimes produce a few flower-buds.  For instance, on a vine growing\r\nagainst my house, there were thirteen and twenty-two flower-buds\r\nrespectively on two flower-tendrils, which still retained their\r\ncharacteristic qualities of sensitiveness and spontaneous movement, but\r\nin a somewhat lessened degree.  On vines in hothouses, so many flowers\r\nare occasionally produced on the flower-tendrils that a double bunch of\r\ngrapes is the result; and this is technically called by gardeners a\r\n“cluster.”  In this state the whole bunch of flowers presents scarcely\r\nany resemblance to a tendril; and, judging from the facts already given,\r\nit would probably possess little power of clasping a support, or of\r\nspontaneous movement.  Such flower-stalks closely resemble in structure\r\nthose borne by _Cissus_.  This genus, belonging to the same family of the\r\nVitaceæ, produces well-developed tendrils and ordinary bunches of\r\nflowers; but there are no gradations between the two states.  If the\r\ngenus _Vitis_ had been unknown, the boldest believer in the modification\r\nof species would never have surmised that the same individual plant, at\r\nthe same period of growth, would have yielded every possible gradation\r\nbetween ordinary flower-stalks for the support of the flowers and fruit,\r\nand tendrils used exclusively for climbing.  But the vine clearly gives\r\nus such a case; and it seems to me as striking and curious an instance of\r\ntransition as can well be conceived.\r\n\r\n_Cissus discolor_.—The young shoots show no more movement than can be\r\naccounted for by daily variations in the action of the light.  The\r\ntendrils, however, revolve with much regularity, following the sun; and,\r\nin the plants observed by me, swept circles of about 5 inches in\r\ndiameter.  Five circles were completed in the following times:—4 hrs. 45\r\nm., 4 hrs. 50 m., 4 hrs. 45 m., 4 hrs. 30 m., and 5 hrs. The same tendril\r\ncontinues to revolve during three or four days.  The tendrils are from 3½\r\nto 5 inches in length.  They are formed of a long foot-stalk, bearing two\r\nshort branches, which in old plants again bifurcate.  The two branches\r\nare not of quite equal length; and as with the vine, the longer one has a\r\nscale at its base.  The tendril stands vertically upwards; the extremity\r\nof the shoot being bent abruptly downwards, and this position is probably\r\nof service to the plant by allowing the tendril to revolve freely and\r\nvertically.\r\n\r\nBoth branches of the tendril, whilst young, are highly sensitive.  A\r\ntouch with a pencil, so gentle as only just to move a tendril borne at\r\nthe end of a long flexible shoot, sufficed to cause it to become\r\nperceptibly curved in four or five minutes.  It became straight again in\r\nrather above one hour.  A loop of soft thread weighing one-seventh of a\r\ngrain (9.25 mg.) was thrice tried, and each time caused the tendril to\r\nbecome curved in 30 or 40 m.  Half this weight produced no effect.  The\r\nlong foot-stalk is much less sensitive, for a slight rubbing produced no\r\neffect, although prolonged contact with a stick caused it to bend.  The\r\ntwo branches are sensitive on all sides, so that they converge if touched\r\non their inner sides, and diverge if touched on their outer sides.  If a\r\nbranch be touched at the same time with equal force on opposite sides,\r\nboth sides are equally stimulated and there is no movement.  Before\r\nexamining this plant, I had observed only tendrils which are sensitive on\r\none side alone, and these when lightly pressed between the finger and\r\nthumb become curved; but on thus pinching many times the tendrils of the\r\n_Cissus_ no curvature ensued, and I falsely inferred at first that they\r\nwere not at all sensitive.\r\n\r\n_Cissus antarcticus_.—The tendrils on a young plant were thick and\r\nstraight, with the tips a little curved.  When their concave surfaces\r\nwere rubbed, and it was necessary to do this with some force, they very\r\nslowly became curved, and subsequently straight again.  They are\r\ntherefore much less sensitive than those of the last species; but they\r\nmade two revolutions, following the sun, rather more rapidly, viz., in 3\r\nhrs. 30 m. and 4 hrs. The internodes do not revolve.\r\n\r\n_Ampelopsis hederacea_ (_Virginian Creeper_).—The internodes apparently\r\ndo not move more than can be accounted for by the varying action of the\r\nlight.  The tendrils are from 4 to 5 inches in length, with the main stem\r\nsending off several lateral branches, which have their tips curved, as\r\nmay be seen in the upper figure (fig. 11).  They exhibit no true\r\nspontaneous revolving movement, but turn, as was long ago observed by\r\nAndrew Knight, {145} from the light to the dark.  I have seen several\r\ntendrils move in less than 24 hours, through an angle of 180° to the dark\r\nside of a case in which a plant was placed, but the movement is sometimes\r\nmuch slower.  The several lateral branches often move independently of\r\none another, and sometimes irregularly, without any apparent cause.\r\nThese tendrils are less sensitive to a touch than any others observed by\r\nme.  By gentle but repeated rubbing with a twig, the lateral branches,\r\nbut not the main stem, became in the course of three or four hours\r\nslightly curved; but they seemed to have hardly any power of again\r\nstraightening themselves.  The tendrils of a plant which had crawled over\r\na large box-tree clasped several of the branches; but I have repeatedly\r\nseen that they will withdraw themselves after seizing a stick.  When they\r\nmeet with a flat surface of wood or a wall (and this is evidently what\r\nthey are adapted for), they turn all their branches towards it, and,\r\nspreading them widely apart, bring their hooked tips laterally into\r\ncontact with it.  In effecting this, the several branches, after touching\r\nthe surface, often rise up, place themselves in a new position, and again\r\ncome down into contact with it.\r\n\r\nIn the course of about two days after a tendril has arranged its branches\r\nso as to press on any surface, the curved tips swell, become bright red,\r\nand form on their under-sides the well-known little discs or cushions\r\nwith which they adhere firmly.  In one case the tips were slightly\r\nswollen in 38 hrs. after coming into contact with a brick; in another\r\ncase they were considerably swollen in 48 hrs., and in an additional 24\r\nhrs. were firmly attached to a smooth board; and lastly, the tips of a\r\nyounger tendril not only swelled but became attached to a stuccoed wall\r\nin 42 hrs.  These adhesive discs resemble, except in colour and in being\r\nlarger, those of _Bignonia capreolata_.  When they were developed in\r\ncontact with a ball of tow, the fibres were separately enveloped, but not\r\nin so effective a manner as by _B. capreolata_.  Discs are never\r\ndeveloped, as far as I have seen, without the stimulus of at least\r\ntemporary contact with some object. {146}  They are generally first\r\nformed on one side of the curved tip, the whole of which often becomes so\r\nmuch changed in appearance, that a line of the original green tissue can\r\nbe traced only along the concave surface.  When, however, a tendril has\r\nclasped a cylindrical stick, an irregular rim or disc is sometimes formed\r\nalong the inner surface at some little distance from the curved tip; this\r\nwas also observed (p. 71) by Mohl.  The discs consist of enlarged cells,\r\nwith smooth projecting hemispherical surfaces, coloured red; they are at\r\nfirst gorged with fluid (see section given by Mohl, p. 70), but\r\nultimately become woody.\r\n\r\nAs the discs soon adhere firmly to such smooth surfaces as planed or\r\npainted wood, or to the polished leaf of the ivy, this alone renders it\r\nprobable that some cement is secreted, as has been asserted to be the\r\ncase (quoted by Mohl, p. 71) by Malpighi.  I removed a number of discs\r\nformed during the previous year from a stuccoed wall, and left them\r\nduring many hours, in warm water, diluted acetic acid and alcohol; but\r\nthe attached grains of silex were not loosened.  Immersion in sulphuric\r\nether for 24 hrs. loosened them much, but warmed essential oils (I tried\r\noil of thyme and peppermint) completely released every particle of stone\r\nin the course of a few hours.  This seems to prove that some resinous\r\ncement is secreted.  The quantity, however, must be small; for when a\r\nplant ascended a thinly whitewashed wall, the discs adhered firmly to the\r\nwhitewash; but as the cement never penetrated the thin layer, they were\r\neasily withdrawn, together with little scales of the whitewash.  It must\r\nnot be supposed that the attachment is effected exclusively by the\r\ncement; for the cellular outgrowth completely envelopes every minute and\r\nirregular projection, and insinuates itself into every crevice.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 11.  Ampelopsis hederacea.  A.  Tendril fully developed,\r\n with a young leaf on the opposite side of the stem.  B.  Older tendril,\r\nseveral weeks after its attachment to a wall, with the branches thickened\r\n and spirally contracted, and with the extremities developed into discs.\r\n  The unattached branches of this tendril have withered and dropped off]\r\n\r\nA tendril which has not become attached to any body, does not contract\r\nspirally; and in course of a week or two shrinks into the finest thread,\r\nwithers and drops off.  An attached tendril, on the other hand, contracts\r\nspirally, and thus becomes highly elastic, so that when the main\r\nfoot-stalk is pulled the strain is distributed equally between all the\r\nattached discs.  For a few days after the attachment of the discs, the\r\ntendril remains weak and brittle, but it rapidly increases in thickness\r\nand acquires great strength.  During the following winter it ceases to\r\nlive, but adheres firmly in a dead state both to its own stem and to the\r\nsurface of attachment.  In the accompanying diagram (fig. 11.) we see the\r\ndifference between a tendril (B) some weeks after its attachment to a\r\nwall, with one (A) from the same plant fully grown but unattached.  That\r\nthe change in the nature of the tissues, as well as the spiral\r\ncontraction, are consequent on the formation of the discs, is well shown\r\nby any lateral branches which have not become attached; for these in a\r\nweek or two wither and drop off, in the same manner as does the whole\r\ntendril if unattached.  The gain in strength and durability in a tendril\r\nafter its attachment is something wonderful.  There are tendrils now\r\nadhering to my house which are still strong, and have been exposed to the\r\nweather in a dead state for fourteen or fifteen years.  One single\r\nlateral branchlet of a tendril, estimated to be at least ten years old,\r\nwas still elastic and supported a weight of exactly two pounds.  The\r\nwhole tendril had five disc-bearing branches of equal thickness and\r\napparently of equal strength; so that after having been exposed during\r\nten years to the weather, it would probably have resisted a strain of ten\r\npounds!\r\n\r\nSAPINDACEÆ.—_Cardiospermum halicacabum_.—In this family, as in the last,\r\nthe tendrils are modified flower-peduncles.  In the present plant the two\r\nlateral branches of the main flower-peduncle have been converted into a\r\npair of tendrils, corresponding with the single “flower-tendril” of the\r\ncommon vine.  The main peduncle is thin, stiff, and from 3 to 4½ inches\r\nin length.  Near the summit, above two little bracts, it divides into\r\nthree branches.  The middle one divides and re-divides, and bears the\r\nflowers; ultimately it grows half as long again as the two other modified\r\nbranches.  These latter are the tendrils; they are at first thicker and\r\nlonger than the middle branch, but never become more than an inch in\r\nlength.  They taper to a point and are flattened, with the lower clasping\r\nsurface destitute of hairs.  At first they project straight up; but soon\r\ndiverging, spontaneously curl downwards so as to become symmetrically and\r\nelegantly hooked, as represented in the diagram.  They are now, whilst\r\nthe flower-buds are still small, ready for action.\r\n\r\n    [Picture: Fig. 12.  Cardiospermum halicacabum.  Upper part of the\r\n                  flower-peduncle with its two tendrils]\r\n\r\nThe two or three upper internodes, whilst young, steadily revolve; those\r\non one plant made two circles, against the course of the sun, in 3 hrs.\r\n12 m.; in a second plant the same course was followed, and the two\r\ncircles were completed in 3 hrs. 41 m.; in a third plant, the internodes\r\nfollowed the sun and made two circles in 3 hrs. 47 m.  The average rate\r\nof these six revolutions was 1 hr. 46 m.  The stem shows no tendency to\r\ntwine spirally round a support; but the allied tendril-bearing genus\r\n_Paullinia_ is said (Mohl, p. 4) to be a twiner.  The flower-peduncles,\r\nwhich stand up above the end of the shoot, are carried round and round by\r\nthe revolving movement of the internodes; and when the stem is securely\r\ntied, the long and thin flower-peduncles themselves are seen to be in\r\ncontinued and sometimes rapid movement from side to side.  They sweep a\r\nwide space, but only occasionally revolve in a regular elliptical course.\r\nBy the combined movements of the internodes and peduncles, one of the two\r\nshort hooked tendrils, sooner or later, catches hold of some twig or\r\nbranch, and then it curls round and securely grasps it.  These tendrils\r\nare, however, but slightly sensitive; for by rubbing their under surface\r\nonly a slight movement is slowly produced.  I hooked a tendril on to a\r\ntwig; and in 1 hr. 45 m. it was curved considerably inwards; in 2 hrs. 30\r\nm. it formed a ring; and in from 5 to 6 hours from being first hooked, it\r\nclosely grasped the stick.  A second tendril acted at nearly the same\r\nrate; but I observed one that took 24 hours before it curled twice round\r\na thin twig.  Tendrils which have caught nothing, spontaneously curl up\r\nto a close helix after the interval of several days.  Those which have\r\ncurled round some object, soon become a little thicker and tougher.  The\r\nlong and thin main peduncle, though spontaneously moving, is not\r\nsensitive and never clasps a support.  Nor does it ever contract\r\nspirally, {152} although a contraction of this kind apparently would have\r\nbeen of service to the plant in climbing.  Nevertheless it climbs pretty\r\nwell without this aid.  The seed-capsules though light, are of enormous\r\nsize (hence its English name of balloon-vine), and as two or three are\r\ncarried on the same peduncle, the tendrils rising close to them may be of\r\nservice in preventing their being dashed to pieces by the wind.  In the\r\nhothouse the tendrils served simply for climbing.\r\n\r\nThe position of the tendrils alone suffices to show their homological\r\nnature.  In two instances one of two tendrils produced a flower at its\r\ntip; this, however, did not prevent its acting properly and curling round\r\na twig.  In a third case both lateral branches which ought to have been\r\nmodified into tendrils, produced flowers like the central branch, and had\r\nquite lost their tendril-structure.\r\n\r\nI have seen, but was not enabled carefully to observe, only one other\r\nclimbing Sapindaceous plant, namely, _Paullinia_.  It was not in flower,\r\nyet bore long forked tendrils.  So that, _Paullinia_, with respect to its\r\ntendrils, appears to bear the same relation to _Cardiospermum_ that\r\n_Cissus_ does to _Vitis_.\r\n\r\nPASSIFLORACEÆ.—After reading the discussion and facts given by Mohl (p.\r\n47) on the nature of the tendrils in this family, no one can doubt that\r\nthey are modified flower-peduncles.  The tendrils and the\r\nflower-peduncles rise close side by side; and my son, William E. Darwin,\r\nmade sketches for me of their earliest state of development in the hybrid\r\n_P. floribunda_.  The two organs appear at first as a single papilla\r\nwhich gradually divides; so that the tendril appears to be a modified\r\nbranch of the flower-peduncle.  My son found one very young tendril\r\nsurmounted by traces of floral organs, exactly like those on the summit\r\nof the true flower-peduncle at the same early age.\r\n\r\n_Passiflora gracilis_.—This well-named, elegant, annual species differs\r\nfrom the other members of the group observed by me, in the young\r\ninternodes having the power of revolving.  It exceeds all the other\r\nclimbing plants which I have examined, in the rapidity of its movements,\r\nand all tendril-bearers in the sensitiveness of the tendrils.  The\r\ninternode which carries the upper active tendril and which likewise\r\ncarries one or two younger immature internodes, made three revolutions,\r\nfollowing the sun, at an average rate of 1 hr. 4 m.; it then made, the\r\nday becoming very hot, three other revolutions at an average rate of\r\nbetween 57 and 58 m.; so that the average of all six revolutions was 1\r\nhr. 1 m.  The apex of the tendril describes elongated ellipses, sometimes\r\nnarrow and sometimes broad, with their longer axes inclined in slightly\r\ndifferent directions.  The plant can ascend a thin upright stick by the\r\naid of its tendrils; but the stem is too stiff for it to twine spirally\r\nround it, even when not interfered with by the tendrils, these having\r\nbeen successively pinched off at an early age.\r\n\r\nWhen the stem is secured, the tendrils are seen to revolve in nearly the\r\nsame manner and at the same rate as the internodes. {154}  The tendrils\r\nare very thin, delicate, and straight, with the exception of the tips,\r\nwhich are a little curved; they are from 7 to 9 inches in length.  A\r\nhalf-grown tendril is not sensitive; but when nearly full-grown they are\r\nextremely sensitive.  A single delicate touch on the concave surface of\r\nthe tip soon caused one to curve; and in 2 minutes it formed an open\r\nhelix.  A loop of soft thread weighing one thirty-second of a grain (2.02\r\nmg.) placed most gently on the tip, thrice caused distinct curvature.  A\r\nbent bit of thin platina wire weighing only fiftieth of a grain (1.23\r\nmg.) twice produced the same effect; but this latter weight, when left\r\nsuspended, did not suffice to cause a permanent curvature.  These trials\r\nwere made under a bell-glass, so that the loops of thread and wire were\r\nnot agitated by the wind.  The movement after a touch is very rapid: I\r\ntook hold of the lower part of several tendrils, and then touched their\r\nconcave tips with a thin twig and watched them carefully through a lens;\r\nthe tips evidently began to bend after the following intervals—31, 25,\r\n32, 31, 28, 39, 31, and 30 seconds; so that the movement was generally\r\nperceptible in half a minute after a touch; but on one occasion it was\r\ndistinctly visible in 25 seconds.  One of the tendrils which thus became\r\nbent in 31 seconds, had been touched two hours previously and had coiled\r\ninto a helix; so that in this interval it had straightened itself and had\r\nperfectly recovered its irritability.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain how often the same tendril would become curved when touched,\r\nI kept a plant in my study, which from being cooler than the hot-house\r\nwas not very favourable for the experiment.  The extremity was gently\r\nrubbed four or five times with a thin stick, and this was done as often\r\nas it was observed to have become nearly straight again after having been\r\nin action; and in the course of 54 hrs. it answered to the stimulus 21\r\ntimes, becoming each time hooked or spiral.  On the last occasion,\r\nhowever, the movement was very slight, and soon afterwards permanent\r\nspiral contraction commenced.  No trials were made during the night, so\r\nthat the tendril would perhaps have answered a greater number of times to\r\nthe stimulus; though, on the other hand, from having no rest it might\r\nhave become exhausted from so many quickly repeated efforts.\r\n\r\nI repeated the experiment made on the _Echinocystis_, and placed several\r\nplants of this _Passiflora_ so close together, that their tendrils were\r\nrepeatedly dragged over each other; but no curvature ensued.  I likewise\r\nrepeatedly flirted small drops of water from a brush on many tendrils,\r\nand syringed others so violently that the whole tendril was dashed about,\r\nbut they never became curved.  The impact from the drops of water was\r\nfelt far more distinctly on my hand than that from the loops of thread\r\n(weighing one thirty-second of a grain) when allowed to fall on it from a\r\nheight, and these loops, which caused the tendrils to become curved, had\r\nbeen placed most gently on them.  Hence it is clear, that the tendrils\r\neither have become habituated to the touch of other tendrils and drops of\r\nrain, or that they were from the first rendered sensitive only to\r\nprolonged though excessively slight pressure of solid objects, with the\r\nexclusion of that from other tendrils.  To show the difference in the\r\nkind of sensitiveness in different plants and likewise to show the force\r\nof the syringe used, I may add that the lightest jet from it instantly\r\ncaused the leaves of a _Mimosa_ to close; whereas the loop of thread\r\nweighing one thirty-second of a grain, when rolled into a ball and placed\r\ngently on the glands at the bases of the leaflets of the _Mimosa_, caused\r\nno action.\r\n\r\n_Passiflora punctata_.—The internodes do not move, but the tendrils\r\nrevolve regularly.  A half-grown and very sensitive tendril made three\r\nrevolutions, opposed to the course of the sun, in 3 hrs. 5 m., 2 hrs. 40\r\nm. and 2 hrs. 50 m.; perhaps it might have travelled more quickly when\r\nnearly full-grown.  A plant was placed in front of a window, and, as with\r\ntwining stems, the light accelerated the movement of the tendril in one\r\ndirection and retarded it in the other; the semicircle towards the light\r\nbeing performed in one instance in 15 m. less time and in a second\r\ninstance in 20 m. less time than that required by the semicircle towards\r\nthe dark end of the room.  Considering the extreme tenuity of these\r\ntendrils, the action of the light on them is remarkable.  The tendrils\r\nare long, and, as just stated, very thin, with the tip slightly curved or\r\nhooked.  The concave side is extremely sensitive to a touch—even a single\r\ntouch causing it to curl inwards; it subsequently straightened itself,\r\nand was again ready to act.  A loop of soft thread weighing one\r\nfourteenth of a grain (4.625 mg.) caused the extreme tip to bend; another\r\ntime I tried to hang the same little loop on an inclined tendril, but\r\nthree times it slid off; yet this extraordinarily slight degree of\r\nfriction sufficed to make the tip curl.  The tendril, though so\r\nsensitive, does not move very quickly after a touch, no conspicuous\r\nmovement being observable until 5 or 10 m. had elapsed.  The convex side\r\nof the tip is not sensitive to a touch or to a suspended loop of thread.\r\nOn one occasion I observed a tendril revolving with the convex side of\r\nthe tip forwards, and in consequence it was not able to clasp a stick,\r\nagainst which it scraped; whereas tendrils revolving with the concave\r\nside forward, promptly seize any object in their path.\r\n\r\n_Passiflora quadrangularis_.—This is a very distinct species.  The\r\ntendrils are thick, long, and stiff; they are sensitive to a touch only\r\non the concave surface towards the extremity.  When a stick was placed so\r\nthat the middle of the tendril came into contact with it, no curvature\r\nensued.  In the hothouse a tendril made two revolutions, each in 2 hrs.\r\n22 m.; in a cool room one was completed in 3 hrs., and a second in 4 hrs.\r\nThe internodes do not revolve; nor do those of the hybrid _P.\r\nfloribunda_.\r\n\r\n_Tacsonia manicata_.—Here again the internodes do not revolve.  The\r\ntendrils are moderately thin and long; one made a narrow ellipse in 5\r\nhrs. 20 m., and the next day a broad ellipse in 5 hrs. 7 m.  The\r\nextremity being lightly rubbed on the concave surface, became just\r\nperceptibly curved in 7 m., distinctly in 10 m., and hooked in 20 m.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the tendrils in the last three families, namely, the\r\nVitaceæ, Sapindaceæ and Passifloraceæ, are modified flower-peduncles.\r\nThis is likewise the case, according to De Candolle (as quoted by Mohl),\r\nwith the tendrils of _Brunnichia_, one of the Polygonaceæ.  In two or\r\nthree species of _Modecca_, one of the Papayaceæ, the tendrils, as I hear\r\nfrom Prof. Oliver, occasionally bear flowers and fruit; so that they are\r\naxial in their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Spiral Contraction of Tendrils_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movement, which shortens the tendrils and renders them elastic,\r\ncommences in half a day, or in a day or two after their extremities have\r\ncaught some object.  There is no such movement in any leaf-climber, with\r\nthe exception of an occasional trace of it in the petioles of _Tropæolum\r\ntricolorum_.  On the other hand, the tendrils of all tendril-bearing\r\nplants, contract spirally after they have caught an object with the\r\nfollowing exceptions.  Firstly, _Corydalis claviculata_, but then this\r\nplant might be called a leaf-climber.  Secondly and thirdly, _Bignonia\r\nunguis_ with its close allies, and _Cardiospermum_; but their tendrils\r\nare so short that their contraction could hardly occur, and would be\r\nquite superfluous.  Fourthly, _Smilaæ aspera_ offers a more marked\r\nexception, as its tendrils are moderately long.  The tendrils of\r\n_Dicentra_, whilst the plant is young, are short and after attachment\r\nonly become slightly flexuous; in older plants they are longer and then\r\nthey contract spirally.  I have seen no other exceptions to the rule that\r\ntendrils, after clasping with their extremities a support, undergo spiral\r\ncontraction.  When, however, the tendril of a plant of which the stem is\r\nimmovably fixed, catches some fixed object, it does not contract, simply\r\nbecause it cannot; this, however, rarely occurs.  In the common Pea the\r\nlateral branches alone contract, and not the central stem; and with most\r\nplants, such as the Vine, Passiflora, Bryony, the basal portion never\r\nforms a spire.\r\n\r\nI have said that in _Corydalis claviculata_ the end of the leaf or\r\ntendril (for this part may be indifferently so called) does not contract\r\ninto a spire.  The branchlets, however, after they have wound round thin\r\ntwigs, become deeply sinuous or zigzag.  Moreover the whole end of the\r\npetiole or tendril, if it seizes nothing, bends after a time abruptly\r\ndownwards and inwards, showing that its outer surface has gone on growing\r\nafter the inner surface has ceased to grow.  That growth is the chief\r\ncause of the spiral contraction of tendrils may be safely admitted, as\r\nshown by the recent researches of H. de Vries.  I will, however, add one\r\nlittle fact in support of this conclusion.\r\n\r\nIf the short, nearly straight portion of an attached tendril of\r\n_Passiflora gracilis_, (and, as I believe, of other tendrils,) between\r\nthe opposed spires, be examined, it will be found to be transversely\r\nwrinkled in a conspicuous manner on the outside; and this would naturally\r\nfollow if the outer side had grown more than the inner side, this part\r\nbeing at the same time forcibly prevented from becoming curved.  So again\r\nthe whole outer surface of a spirally wound tendril becomes wrinkled if\r\nit be pulled straight.  Nevertheless, as the contraction travels from the\r\nextremity of a tendril, after it has been stimulated by contact with a\r\nsupport, down to the base, I cannot avoid doubting, from reasons\r\npresently to be given, whether the whole effect ought to be attributed to\r\ngrowth.  An unattached tendril rolls itself up into a flat helix, as in\r\nthe case of Cardiospermum, if the contraction commences at the extremity\r\nand is quite regular; but if the continued growth of the outer surface is\r\na little lateral, or if the process begins near the base, the terminal\r\nportion cannot be rolled up within the basal portion, and the tendril\r\nthen forms a more or less open spire.  A similar result follows if the\r\nextremity has caught some object, and is thus held fast.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils of many kinds of plants, if they catch nothing, contract\r\nafter an interval of several days or weeks into a spire; but in these\r\ncases the movement takes place after the tendril has lost its revolving\r\npower and hangs down; it has also then partly or wholly lost its\r\nsensibility; so that this movement can be of no use.  The spiral\r\ncontraction of unattached tendrils is a much slower process than that of\r\nattached ones.  Young tendrils which have caught a support and are\r\nspirally contracted, may constantly be seen on the same stem with the\r\nmuch older unattached and uncontracted tendrils.  In the _Echinocystis_ I\r\nhave seen a tendril with the two lateral branches encircling twigs and\r\ncontracted into beautiful spires, whilst the main branch which had caught\r\nnothing remained for many days straight.  In this plant I once observed a\r\nmain branch after it had caught a stick become spirally flexuous in 7\r\nhrs., and spirally contracted in 18 hrs.  Generally the tendrils of the\r\n_Echinocystis_ begin to contract in from 12 hrs. to 24 hrs. after\r\ncatching some object; whilst unattached tendrils do not begin to contract\r\nuntil two or three or even more days after all revolving movement has\r\nceased.  A full-grown tendril of _Passiflora quadrangularis_ which had\r\ncaught a stick began in 8 hrs. to contract, and in 24 hrs. formed several\r\nspires; a younger tendril, only two-thirds grown, showed the first trace\r\nof contraction in two days after clasping a stick, and in two more days\r\nformed several spires.  It appears, therefore, that the contraction does\r\nnot begin until the tendril is grown to nearly its full length.  Another\r\nyoung tendril of about the same age and length as the last did not catch\r\nany object; it acquired its full length in four days; in six additional\r\ndays it first became flexuous, and in two more days formed one complete\r\nspire.  This first spire was formed towards the basal end, and the\r\ncontraction steadily but slowly progressed towards the apex; but the\r\nwhole was not closely wound up into a spire until 21 days had elapsed\r\nfrom the first observation, that is, until 17 days after the tendril had\r\ngrown to its full length.\r\n\r\nThe spiral contraction of tendrils is quite independent of their power of\r\nspontaneously revolving, for it occurs in tendrils, such as those of\r\n_Lathyrus grandiflorus_ and _Ampelopsis hederacea_, which do not revolve.\r\nIt is not necessarily related to the curling of the tips round a support,\r\nas we see with the Ampelopsis and _Bignonia capreolata_, in which the\r\ndevelopment of adherent discs suffices to cause spiral contraction.  Yet\r\nin some cases this contraction seems connected with the curling or\r\nclasping movement, due to contact with a support; for not only does it\r\nsoon follow this act, but the contraction generally begins close to the\r\ncurled extremity, and travels downwards to the base.  If, however, a\r\ntendril be very slack, the whole length almost simultaneously becomes at\r\nfirst flexuous and then spiral.  Again, the tendrils of some few plants\r\nnever contract spirally unless they have first seized hold of some\r\nobject; if they catch nothing they hang down, remaining straight, until\r\nthey wither and drop off: this is the case with the tendrils of Bignonia,\r\nwhich consist of modified leaves, and with those of three genera of the\r\nVitaceæ, which are modified flower-peduncles.  But in the great majority\r\nof cases, tendrils which have never come in contact with any object,\r\nafter a time contract spirally.  All these facts taken together, show\r\nthat the act of clasping a support and the spiral contraction of the\r\nwhole length of the tendril, are phenomena not necessarily connected.\r\n\r\nThe spiral contraction which ensues after a tendril has caught a support\r\nis of high service to the plant; hence its almost universal occurrence\r\nwith species belonging to widely different orders.  When a shoot is\r\ninclined and its tendril has caught an object above, the spiral\r\ncontraction drags up the shoot.  When the shoot is upright, the growth of\r\nthe stem, after the tendrils have seized some object above, would leave\r\nit slack, were it not for the spiral contraction which draws up the stem\r\nas it increases in length.  Thus there is no waste of growth, and the\r\nstretched stem ascends by the shortest course.  When a terminal branchlet\r\nof the tendril of Cobæa catches a stick, we have seen how well the spiral\r\ncontraction successively brings the other branchlets, one after the\r\nother, into contact with the stick, until the whole tendril grasps it in\r\nan inextricable knot.  When a tendril has caught a yielding object, this\r\nis sometimes enveloped and still further secured by the spiral folds, as\r\nI have seen with _Passiflora quadrangularis_; but this action is of\r\nlittle importance.\r\n\r\nA far more important service rendered by the spiral contraction of the\r\ntendrils is that they are thus made highly elastic.  As before remarked\r\nunder Ampelopsis, the strain is thus distributed equally between the\r\nseveral attached branches; and this renders the whole far stronger than\r\nit otherwise would be, as the branches cannot break separately.  It is\r\nthis elasticity which protects both branched and simple tendrils from\r\nbeing torn away from their supports during stormy weather.  I have more\r\nthan once gone on purpose during a gale to watch a Bryony growing in an\r\nexposed hedge, with its tendrils attached to the surrounding bushes; and\r\nas the thick and thin branches were tossed to and fro by the wind, the\r\ntendrils, had they not been excessively elastic, would instantly have\r\nbeen torn off and the plant thrown prostrate.  But as it was, the Bryony\r\nsafely rode out the gale, like a ship with two anchors down, and with a\r\nlong range of cable ahead to serve as a spring as she surges to the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nWhen an unattached tendril contracts spirally, the spire always runs in\r\nthe same direction from tip to base.  A tendril, on the other hand, which\r\nhas caught a support by its extremity, although the same side is concave\r\nfrom end to end, invariably becomes twisted in one part in one direction,\r\nand in another part in the opposite direction; the oppositely turned\r\nspires being separated by a short straight portion.  This curious and\r\nsymmetrical structure has been noticed by several botanists, but has not\r\nbeen sufficiently explained. {165}  It occurs without exception with all\r\ntendrils which after catching an object contract spirally, but is of\r\ncourse most conspicuous in the longer tendrils.  It never occurs with\r\nuncaught tendrils; and when this appears to have occurred, it will be\r\nfound that the tendril had originally seized some object and had\r\nafterwards been torn free.  Commonly, all the spires at one end of an\r\nattached tendril run in one direction, and all those at the other end in\r\nthe opposite direction, with a single short straight portion in the\r\nmiddle; but I have seen a tendril with the spires alternately turning\r\nfive times in opposite directions, with straight pieces between them; and\r\nM. Léon has seen seven or eight such alternations.  Whether the spires\r\nturn once or more than once in opposite directions, there are as many\r\nturns in the one direction as in the other.  For instance, I gathered ten\r\nattached tendrils of the Bryony, the longest with 33, and the shortest\r\nwith only 8 spiral turns; and the number of turns in the one direction\r\nwas in every case the same (within one) as in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n     [Picture: Fig. 13.  A caught tendril of Bryonia dioica, spirally\r\n                    contracted in reserved directions]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this curious little fact is not difficult.  I will not\r\nattempt any geometrical reasoning, but will give only a practical\r\nillustration.  In doing this, I shall first have to allude to a point\r\nwhich was almost passed over when treating of Twining-plants.  If we hold\r\nin our left hand a bundle of parallel strings, we can with our right hand\r\nturn these round and round, thus imitating the revolving movement of a\r\ntwining plant, and the strings do not become twisted.  But if we hold at\r\nthe same time a stick in our left hand, in such a position that the\r\nstrings become spirally turned round it, they will inevitably become\r\ntwisted.  Hence a straight coloured line, painted along the internodes of\r\na twining plant before it has wound round a support, becomes twisted or\r\nspiral after it has wound round.  I painted a red line on the straight\r\ninternodes of a _Humulus_, _Mikania_, _Ceropegia_, _Convolvulus_, and\r\n_Phaseolus_, and saw it become twisted as the plant wound round a stick.\r\nIt is possible that the stems of some plants by spontaneously turning on\r\ntheir own axes, at the proper rate and in the proper direction, might\r\navoid becoming twisted; but I have seen no such case.\r\n\r\nIn the above illustration, the parallel strings were wound round a stick;\r\nbut this is by no means necessary, for if wound into a hollow coil (as\r\ncan be done with a narrow slip of elastic paper) there is the same\r\ninevitable twisting of the axis.  When, therefore, a free tendril coils\r\nitself into a spire, it must either become twisted along its whole length\r\n(and this never occurs), or the free extremity must turn round as many\r\ntimes as there are spires formed.  It was hardly necessary to observe\r\nthis fact; but I did so by affixing little paper vanes to the extreme\r\npoints of the tendrils of _Echinocystis_ and _Passiflora quadrangularis_;\r\nand as the tendril contracted itself into successive spires, the vane\r\nslowly revolved.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand the meaning of the spires being invariably turned\r\nin opposite directions, in tendrils which from having caught some object\r\nare fixed at both ends.  Let us suppose a caught tendril to make thirty\r\nspiral turns all in the same direction; the inevitable result would be\r\nthat it would become twisted thirty times on its own axis.  This twisting\r\nwould not only require considerable force, but, as I know by trial, would\r\nburst the tendril before the thirty turns were completed.  Such cases\r\nnever really occur; for, as already stated, when a tendril has caught a\r\nsupport and is spirally contracted, there are always as many turns in one\r\ndirection as in the other; so that the twisting of the axis in the one\r\ndirection is exactly compensated by the twisting in the opposite\r\ndirection.  We can further see how the tendency is given to make the\r\nlater formed coils opposite to those, whether turned to the right or to\r\nthe left, which are first made.  Take a piece of string, and let it hang\r\ndown with the lower end fixed to the floor; then wind the upper end\r\n(holding the string quite loosely) spirally round a perpendicular pencil,\r\nand this will twist the lower part of the string; and after it has been\r\nsufficiently twisted, it will be seen to curve itself into an open spire,\r\nwith the curves running in an opposite direction to those round the\r\npencil, and consequently with a straight piece of string between the\r\nopposed spires.  In short, we have given to the string the regular spiral\r\narrangement of a tendril caught at both ends.  The spiral contraction\r\ngenerally begins at the extremity which has clasped a support; and these\r\nfirst-formed spires give a twist to the axis of the tendril, which\r\nnecessarily inclines the basal part into an opposite spiral curvature.  I\r\ncannot resist giving one other illustration, though superfluous: when a\r\nhaberdasher winds up ribbon for a customer, he does not wind it into a\r\nsingle coil; for, if he did, the ribbon would twist itself as many times\r\nas there were coils; but he winds it into a figure of eight on his thumb\r\nand little finger, so that he alternately takes turns in opposite\r\ndirections, and thus the ribbon is not twisted.  So it is with tendrils,\r\nwith this sole difference, that they take several consecutive turns in\r\none direction and then the same number in an opposite direction; but in\r\nboth cases the self-twisting is avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary on the Nature and Action of Tendrils_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the majority of tendril-bearing plants the young internodes revolve\r\nin more or less broad ellipses, like those made by twining plants; but\r\nthe figures described, when carefully traced, generally form irregular\r\nellipsoidal spires.  The rate of revolution varies from one to five hours\r\nin different species, and consequently is in some cases more rapid than\r\nwith any twining plant, and is never so slow as with those many twiners\r\nwhich take more than five hours for each revolution.  The direction is\r\nvariable even in the same individual plant.  In _Passiflora_, the\r\ninternodes of only one species have the power of revolving.  The Vine is\r\nthe weakest revolver observed by me, apparently exhibiting only a trace\r\nof a former power.  In the _Eccremocarpus_ the movement is interrupted by\r\nmany long pauses.  Very few tendril-bearing plants can spirally twine up\r\nan upright stick.  Although the power of twining has generally been lost,\r\neither from the stiffness or shortness of the internodes, from the size\r\nof the leaves, or from some other unknown cause, the revolving movement\r\nof the stem serves to bring the tendrils into contact with surrounding\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe tendrils themselves also spontaneously revolve.  The movement begins\r\nwhilst the tendril is young, and is at first slow.  The mature tendrils\r\nof _Bignonia littoralis_ move much slower than the internodes.\r\nGenerally, the internodes and tendrils revolve together at the same rate;\r\nin Cissus, Cobæa, and most Passifloræ, the tendrils alone revolve; in\r\nother cases, as with _Lathyrus aphaca_, only the internodes move,\r\ncarrying with them the motionless tendrils; and, lastly (and this is the\r\nfourth possible case), neither internodes nor tendrils spontaneously\r\nrevolve, as with _Lathyrus grandiflorus_ and _Ampelopsis_.  In most\r\nBignonias, Eccremocarpus Mutisia, and the Fumariaceæ, the internodes,\r\npetioles and tendrils all move harmoniously together.  In every case the\r\nconditions of life must be favourable in order that the different parts\r\nshould act in a perfect manner.\r\n\r\nTendrils revolve by the curvature of their whole length, excepting the\r\nsensitive extremity and the base, which parts do not move, or move but\r\nlittle.  The movement is of the same nature as that of the revolving\r\ninternodes, and, from the observations of Sachs and H. de Vries, no doubt\r\nis due to the same cause, namely, the rapid growth of a longitudinal\r\nband, which travels round the tendril and successively bows each part to\r\nthe opposite side.  Hence, if a line be painted along that surface which\r\nhappens at the time to be convex, the line becomes first lateral, then\r\nconcave, then lateral, and ultimately again convex.  This experiment can\r\nbe tried only on the thicker tendrils, which are not affected by a thin\r\ncrust of dried paint.  The extremities are often slightly curved or\r\nhooked, and the curvature of this part is never reversed; in this respect\r\nthey differ from the extremities of twining shoots, which not only\r\nreverse their curvature, or at least become periodically straight, but\r\ncurve themselves in a greater degree than the lower part.  In most other\r\nrespects a tendril acts as if it were one of several revolving\r\ninternodes, which all move together by successively bending to each point\r\nof the compass.  There is, however, in many cases this unimportant\r\ndifference, that the curving tendril is separated from the curving\r\ninternode by a rigid petiole.  With most tendril-bearers the summit of\r\nthe stem or shoot projects above the point from which the tendril arises;\r\nand it is generally bent to one side, so as to be out of the way of the\r\nrevolutions swept by the tendril.  In those plants in which the terminal\r\nshoot is not sufficiently out of the way, as we have seen with the\r\nEchinocystis, as soon as the tendril comes in its revolving course to\r\nthis point, it stiffens and straightens itself, and thus rising\r\nvertically up passes over the obstacle in an admirable manner.\r\n\r\nAll tendrils are sensitive, but in various degrees, to contact with an\r\nobject, and curve towards the touched side.  With several plants a single\r\ntouch, so slight as only just to move the highly flexible tendril, is\r\nenough to induce curvature.  _Passiflora gracilis_ possesses the most\r\nsensitive tendrils which I have observed: a bit of platina wire 0.02 of a\r\ngrain (1.23 mg.) in weight, gently placed on the concave point, caused a\r\ntendril to become hooked, as did a loop of soft, thin cotton thread\r\nweighing one thirty-second of a grain (2.02 mg.)  With the tendrils of\r\nseveral other plants, loops weighing one sixteenth of a grain (4.05 mg.)\r\nsufficed.  The point of a tendril of _Passiflora gracilis_ began to move\r\ndistinctly in 25 seconds after a touch, and in many cases after 30\r\nseconds.  Asa Gray also saw movement in the tendrils of the\r\nCucurbitaceous genus, _Sicyos_, in 30 seconds.  The tendrils of some\r\nother plants, when lightly rubbed, moved in a few minutes; with Dicentra\r\nin half-an-hour; with Smilax in an hour and a quarter or half; and with\r\nAmpelopsis still more slowly.  The curling movement consequent on a\r\nsingle touch continues to increase for a considerable time, then ceases;\r\nafter a few hours the tendril uncurls itself, and is again ready to act.\r\nWhen the tendrils of several kinds of plants were caused to bend by\r\nextremely light weights suspended on them, they seemed to grow accustomed\r\nto so slight a stimulus, and straightened themselves, as if the loops had\r\nbeen removed.  It makes no difference what sort of object a tendril\r\ntouches, with the remarkable exception of other tendrils and drops of\r\nwater, as was observed with the extremely sensitive-tendrils of\r\n_Passiflora gracilis_ and of the _Echinocystis_.  I have, however, seen\r\ntendrils of the Bryony which had temporarily caught other tendrils, and\r\noften in the case of the vine.\r\n\r\nTendrils of which the extremities are permanently and slightly curved,\r\nare sensitive only on the concave surface; other tendrils, such as those\r\nof the Cobæa (though furnished with horny hooks directed to one side) and\r\nthose of _Cissus discolor_, are sensitive on all sides.  Hence the\r\ntendrils of this latter plant, when stimulated by a touch of equal force\r\non opposite sides, did not bend.  The inferior and lateral surfaces of\r\nthe tendrils of _Mutisia_ are sensitive, but not the upper surface.  With\r\nbranched tendrils, the several branches act alike; but in the _Hanburya_\r\nthe lateral spur-like branch does not acquire (for excellent reasons\r\nwhich have been explained) its sensitiveness nearly so soon as the main\r\nbranch.  With most tendrils the lower or basal part is either not at all\r\nsensitive, or sensitive only to prolonged contact.  We thus see that the\r\nsensitiveness of tendrils is a special and localized capacity.  It is\r\nquite independent of the power of spontaneously revolving; for the\r\ncurling of the terminal portion from touch does not in the least\r\ninterrupt the former movement.  In _Bignonia unguis_ and its close\r\nallies, the petioles of the leaves, as well as the tendrils, are\r\nsensitive to a touch.\r\n\r\nTwining plants when they come into contact with a stick, curl round it\r\ninvariably in the direction of their revolving movement; but tendrils\r\ncurl indifferently to either side, in accordance with the position of the\r\nstick and the side which is first touched.  The clasping movement of the\r\nextremity is apparently not steady, but undulatory or vermicular in its\r\nnature, as may be inferred from the curious manner in which the tendrils\r\nof the Echinocystis slowly crawled round a smooth stick.\r\n\r\nAs with a few exceptions tendrils spontaneously revolve, it may be\r\nasked,—why have they been endowed with sensitiveness?—why, when they come\r\ninto contact with a stick, do they not, like twining plants, spirally\r\nwind round it?  One reason may be that they are in most cases so flexible\r\nand thin, that when brought into contact with any object, they would\r\nalmost certainly yield and be dragged onwards by the revolving movement.\r\nMoreover, the sensitive extremities have no revolving power as far as I\r\nhave observed, and could not by this means curl round a support.  With\r\ntwining plants, on the other hand, the extremity spontaneously bends more\r\nthan any other part; and this is of high importance for the ascent of the\r\nplant, as may be seen on a windy day.  It is, however, possible that the\r\nslow movement of the basal and stiffer parts of certain tendrils, which\r\nwind round sticks placed in their path, may be analogous to that of\r\ntwining plants.  But I hardly attended sufficiently to this point, and it\r\nwould have been difficult to distinguish between a movement due to\r\nextremely dull irritability, from the arrestment of the lower part,\r\nwhilst the upper part continued to move onwards.\r\n\r\nTendrils which are only three-fourths grown, and perhaps even at an\r\nearlier age, but not whilst extremely young, have the power of revolving\r\nand of grasping any object which they touch.  These two capacities are\r\ngenerally acquired at about the same period, and both fail when the\r\ntendril is full grown.  But in _Cobæa_ and _Passiflora punctata_ the\r\ntendrils begin to revolve in a useless manner, before they have become\r\nsensitive.  In the Echinocystis they retain their sensitiveness for some\r\ntime after they have ceased to revolve and after they have sunk\r\ndownwards; in this position, even if they were able to seize an object,\r\nsuch power would be of no service in supporting the stem.  It is a rare\r\ncircumstance thus to detect any superfluity or imperfection in the action\r\nof tendrils—organs which are so excellently adapted for the functions\r\nwhich they have to perform; but we see that they are not always perfect,\r\nand it would be rash to assume that any existing tendril has reached the\r\nutmost limit of perfection.\r\n\r\nSome tendrils have their revolving motion accelerated or retarded, in\r\nmoving to or from the light; others, as with the Pea, seem indifferent to\r\nits action; others move steadily from the light to the dark, and this\r\naids them in an important manner in finding a support.  For instance, the\r\ntendrils of _Bignonia capreolata_ bend from the light to the dark as\r\ntruly as a wind-vane from the wind.  In the Eccremocarpus the extremities\r\nalone twist and turn about so as to bring their finer branches and hooks\r\ninto close contact with any dark surface, or into crevices and holes.\r\n\r\nA short time after a tendril has caught a support, it contracts with some\r\nrare exceptions into a spire; but the manner of contraction and the\r\nseveral important advantages thus gained have been discussed so lately,\r\nthat nothing need here be repeated on the subject.  Tendrils soon after\r\ncatching a support grow much stronger and thicker, and sometimes more\r\ndurable to a wonderful degree; and this shows how much their internal\r\ntissues must be changed.  Occasionally it is the part which is wound\r\nround a support which chiefly becomes thicker and stronger; I have seen,\r\nfor instance, this part of a tendril of _Bignonia æquinoctialis_ twice as\r\nthick and rigid as the free basal part.  Tendrils which have caught\r\nnothing soon shrink and wither; but in some species of Bignonia they\r\ndisarticulate and fall off like leaves in autumn.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAny one who had not closely observed tendrils of many kinds would\r\nprobably infer that their action was uniform.  This is the case with the\r\nsimpler kinds, which simply curl round an object of moderate thickness,\r\nwhatever its nature may be. {176}  But the genus Bignonia shows us what\r\ndiversity of action there may be between the tendrils of closely allied\r\nspecies.  In all the nine species observed by me, the young internodes\r\nrevolve vigorously; the tendrils also revolve, but in some of the species\r\nin a very feeble manner; and lastly the petioles of nearly all revolve,\r\nthough with unequal power.  The petioles of three of the species, and the\r\ntendrils of all are sensitive to contact.  In the first-described\r\nspecies, the tendrils resemble in shape a bird’s foot, and they are of no\r\nservice to the stem in spirally ascending a thin upright stick, but they\r\ncan seize firm hold of a twig or branch.  When the stem twines round a\r\nsomewhat thick stick, a slight degree of sensitiveness possessed by the\r\npetioles is brought into play, and the whole leaf together with the\r\ntendril winds round it.  In _B. unguis_ the petioles are more sensitive,\r\nand have greater power of movement than those of the last species; they\r\nare able, together with the tendrils, to wind inextricably round a thin\r\nupright stick; but the stem does not twine so well.  _B. Tweedyana_ has\r\nsimilar powers, but in addition, emits aërial roots which adhere to the\r\nwood.  In _B. venusta_ the tendrils are converted into elongated\r\nthree-pronged grapnels, which move spontaneously in a conspicuous manner;\r\nthe petioles, however, have lost their sensitiveness.  The stem of this\r\nspecies can twine round an upright stick, and is aided in its ascent by\r\nthe tendrils seizing the stick alternately some way above and then\r\ncontracting spirally.  In _B. littoralis_ the tendrils, petioles, and\r\ninternodes, all revolve spontaneously.  The stem, however, cannot twine,\r\nbut ascends an upright stick by seizing it above with both tendrils\r\ntogether, which then contract into a spire.  The tips of these tendrils\r\nbecome developed into adhesive discs.  _B. speciosa_ possesses similar\r\npowers of movement as the last species, but it cannot twine round a\r\nstick, though it can ascend by clasping the stick horizontally with one\r\nor both of its unbranched tendrils.  These tendrils continually insert\r\ntheir pointed ends into minute crevices or holes, but as they are always\r\nwithdrawn by the subsequent spiral contraction, the habit seems to us in\r\nour ignorance useless.  Lastly, the stem of _B. capreolata_ twines\r\nimperfectly; the much-branched tendrils revolve in a capricious manner,\r\nand bend from the light to the dark; their hooked extremities, even\r\nwhilst immature, crawl into crevices, and, when mature, seize any thin\r\nprojecting point; in either case they develop adhesive discs, and these\r\nhave the power of enveloping the finest fibres.\r\n\r\nIn the allied Eccremocarpus the internodes, petioles, and much-branched\r\ntendrils all spontaneously revolve together.  The tendrils do not as a\r\nwhole turn from the light; but their bluntly-hooked extremities arrange\r\nthemselves neatly on any surface with which they come into contact,\r\napparently so as to avoid the light.  They act best when each branch\r\nseizes a few thin stems, like the culms of a grass, which they afterwards\r\ndraw together into a solid bundle by the spiral contraction of all the\r\nbranches.  In Cobæa the finely-branched tendrils alone revolve; the\r\nbranches terminate in sharp, hard, double, little hooks, with both points\r\ndirected to the same side; and these turn by well-adapted movements to\r\nany object with which they come into contact.  The tips of the branches\r\nalso crawl into dark crevices or holes.  The tendrils and internodes of\r\nAmpelopsis have little or no power of revolving; the tendrils are but\r\nlittle sensitive to contact; their hooked extremities cannot seize thin\r\nobjects; they will not even clasp a stick, unless in extreme need of a\r\nsupport; but they turn from the light to the dark, and, spreading out\r\ntheir branches in contact with any nearly flat surface, develop discs.\r\nThese adhere by the secretion of some cement to a wall, or even to a\r\npolished surface; and this is more than the discs of the _Bignonia\r\ncapreolata_ can effect.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of these adherent discs is one of the most\r\nremarkable peculiarities possessed by any tendrils.  We have seen that\r\nsuch discs are formed by two species of Bignonia, by Ampelopsis, and,\r\naccording to Naudin, {179} by the Cucurbitaceous genus _Peponopsis\r\nadhærens_.  In Anguria the lower surface of the tendril, after it has\r\nwound round a stick, forms a coarsely cellular layer, which closely fits\r\nthe wood, but is not adherent; whilst in Hanburya a similar layer is\r\nadherent.  The growth of these cellular out-growths depends, (except in\r\nthe case of the _Haplolophium_ and of one species of Ampelopsis,) on the\r\nstimulus from contact.  It is a singular fact that three families, so\r\nwidely distinct as the Bignoniaceæ, Vitaceæ, and Cucurbitaceæ, should\r\npossess species with tendrils having this remarkable power.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nSachs attributes all the movements of tendrils to rapid growth on the\r\nside opposite to that which becomes concave.  These movements consist of\r\nrevolving nutation, the bending to and from the light, and in opposition\r\nto gravity, those caused by a touch, and spiral contraction.  It is rash\r\nto differ from so great an authority, but I cannot believe that one at\r\nleast of these movements—curvature from a touch—is thus caused. {180}  In\r\nthe first place it may be remarked that the movement of nutation differs\r\nfrom that due to a touch, in so far that in some cases the two powers are\r\nacquired by the same tendril at different periods of growth; and the\r\nsensitive part of the tendril does not seem capable of nutation.  One of\r\nmy chief reasons for doubting whether the curvature from a touch is the\r\nresult of growth, is the extraordinary rapidity of the movement.  I have\r\nseen the extremity of a tendril of _Passiflora gracilis_, after being\r\ntouched, distinctly bent in 25 seconds, and often in 30 seconds; and so\r\nit is with the thicker tendril of Sicyos.  It appears hardly credible\r\nthat their outer surfaces could have actually grown in length, which\r\nimplies a permanent modification of structure, in so short a time.  The\r\ngrowth, moreover, on this view must be considerable, for if the touch has\r\nbeen at all rough the extremity is coiled in two or three minutes into a\r\nspire of several turns.\r\n\r\nWhen the extreme tip of the tendril of Echinocystis caught hold of a\r\nsmooth stick, it coiled itself in a few hours (as described at p. 132)\r\ntwice or thrice round the stick, apparently by an undulatory movement.\r\nAt first I attributed this movement to the growth of the outside; black\r\nmarks were therefore made, and the interspaces measured, but I could not\r\nthus detect any increase in length.  Hence it seems probable in this case\r\nand in others, that the curvature of the tendril from a touch depends on\r\nthe contraction of the cells along the concave side.  Sachs himself\r\nadmits {181} that “if the growth which takes place in the entire tendril\r\nat the time of contact with a support is small, a considerable\r\nacceleration occurs on the convex surface, but in general there is no\r\nelongation on the concave surface, or there may even be a _contraction_;\r\nin the case of a tendril of Cucurbita this contraction amounted to nearly\r\none-third of the original length.”  In a subsequent passage Sachs seems\r\nto feel some difficulty in accounting for this kind of contraction.  It\r\nmust not however be supposed from the foregoing remarks that I entertain\r\nany doubt, after reading De Vries’ observations, about the outer and\r\nstretched surfaces of attached tendrils afterwards increasing in length\r\nby growth.  Such increase seems to me quite compatible with the first\r\nmovement being independent of growth.  Why a delicate touch should cause\r\none side of a tendril to contract we know as little as why, on the view\r\nheld by Sachs, it should lead to extraordinarily rapid growth of the\r\nopposite side.  The chief or sole reason for the belief that the\r\ncurvature of a tendril when touched is due to rapid growth, seems to be\r\nthat tendrils lose their sensitiveness and power of movement after they\r\nhave grown to their full length; but this fact is intelligible, if we\r\nbear in mind that all the functions of a tendril are adapted to drag up\r\nthe terminal growing shoot towards the light.  Of what use would it be,\r\nif an old and full-grown tendril, arising from the lower part of a shoot,\r\nwere to retain its power of clasping a support?  This would be of no use;\r\nand we have seen with tendrils so many instances of close adaptation and\r\nof the economy of means, that we may feel assured that they would acquire\r\nirritability and the power of clasping a support at the proper\r\nage—namely, youth—and would not uselessly retain such power beyond the\r\nproper age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nHOOK AND ROOT-CLIMBERS.—CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants climbing by the aid of hooks, or merely scrambling over other\r\nplants—Root-climbers, adhesive matter secreted by the rootlets—General\r\nconclusions with respect to climbing plants, and the stages of their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Hook-Climbers_.—In my introductory remarks, I stated that, besides the\r\ntwo first great classes of climbing plants, namely, those which twine\r\nround a support, and those endowed with irritability enabling them to\r\nseize hold of objects by means of their petioles or tendrils, there are\r\ntwo other classes, hook-climbers and root-climbers.  Many plants,\r\nmoreover, as Fritz Müller has remarked, {183} climb or scramble up\r\nthickets in a still more simple fashion, without any special aid,\r\nexcepting that their leading shoots are generally long and flexible.  It\r\nmay, however, be suspected from what follows, that these shoots in some\r\ncases tend to avoid the light.  The few hook-climbers which I have\r\nobserved, namely, _Galium aparine_, _Rubus australis_, and some climbing\r\nRoses, exhibit no spontaneous revolving movement.  If they had possessed\r\nthis power, and had been capable of twining, they would have been placed\r\nin the class of Twiners; for some twiners are furnished with spines or\r\nhooks, which aid them in their ascent.  For instance, the Hop, which is a\r\ntwiner, has reflexed hooks as large as those of the _Galium_; some other\r\ntwiners have stiff reflexed hairs; and _Dipladenia_ has a circle of blunt\r\nspines at the bases of its leaves.  I have seen only one tendril-bearing\r\nplant, namely, _Smilax aspera_, which is furnished with reflexed spines;\r\nbut this is the case with several branch-climbers in South Brazil and\r\nCeylon; and their branches graduate into true tendrils.  Some few plants\r\napparently depend solely on their hooks for climbing, and yet do so\r\nefficiently, as certain palms in the New and Old Worlds.  Even some\r\nclimbing Roses will ascend the walls of a tall house, if covered with a\r\ntrellis.  How this is effected I know not; for the young shoots of one\r\nsuch Rose, when placed in a pot in a window, bent irregularly towards the\r\nlight during the day and from the light during the night, like the shoots\r\nof any common plant; so that it is not easy to understand how they could\r\nhave got under a trellis close to the wall. {184}\r\n\r\n_Root-climbers_.—A good many plants come under this class, and are\r\nexcellent climbers.  One of the most remarkable is the _Marcgravia\r\numbellata_, the stem of which in the tropical forests of South America,\r\nas I hear from Mr. Spruce, grows in a curiously flattened manner against\r\nthe trunks of trees; here and there it puts forth claspers (roots), which\r\nadhere to the trunk, and, if the latter be slender, completely embrace\r\nit.  When this plant has climbed to the light, it produces free branches\r\nwith rounded stems, clad with sharp-pointed leaves, wonderfully different\r\nin appearance from those borne by the stem as long as it remains\r\nadherent.  This surprising difference in the leaves, I have also observed\r\nin a plant of _Marcgravia dubia_ in my hothouse.  Root-climbers, as far\r\nas I have seen, namely, the Ivy (_Hedera heliæ_), _Ficus repens_, and _F.\r\nbarbatus_, have no power of movement, not even from the light to the\r\ndark.  As previously stated, the _Hoya carnosa_ (Asclepiadaceæ) is a\r\nspiral twiner, and likewise adheres by rootlets even to a flat wall.  The\r\ntendril-bearing _Bignonia Tweedyana_ emits roots, which curve half round\r\nand adhere to thin sticks.  The _Tecoma radicans_ (Bignoniaceæ), which is\r\nclosely allied to many spontaneously revolving species, climbs by\r\nrootlets; nevertheless, its young shoots apparently move about more than\r\ncan be accounted for by the varying action of the light.\r\n\r\nI have not closely observed many root-climbers, but can give one curious\r\nfact.  _Ficus repens_ climbs up a wall just like Ivy; and when the young\r\nrootlets are made to press lightly on slips of glass, they emit after\r\nabout a week’s interval, as I observed several times, minute drops of\r\nclear fluid, not in the least milky like that exuded from a wound.  This\r\nfluid is slightly viscid, but cannot be drawn out into threads.  It has\r\nthe remarkable property of not soon drying; a drop, about the size of\r\nhalf a pin’s head, was slightly spread out on glass, and I scattered on\r\nit some minute grains of sand.  The glass was left exposed in a drawer\r\nduring hot and dry weather, and if the fluid had been water, it would\r\ncertainly have dried in a few minutes; but it remained fluid, closely\r\nsurrounding each grain of sand, during 128 days: how much longer it would\r\nhave remained I cannot say.  Some other rootlets were left in contact\r\nwith the glass for about ten days or a fortnight, and the drops of\r\nsecreted fluid were now rather larger, and so viscid that they could be\r\ndrawn out into threads.  Some other rootlets were left in contact during\r\ntwenty-three days, and these were firmly cemented to the glass.  Hence we\r\nmay conclude that the rootlets first secrete a slightly viscid fluid,\r\nsubsequently absorb the watery parts, (for we have seen that the fluid\r\nwill not dry by itself,) and ultimately leave a cement.  When the\r\nrootlets were torn from the glass, atoms of yellowish matter were left on\r\nit, which were partly dissolved by a drop of bisulphide of carbon; and\r\nthis extremely volatile fluid was rendered very much less volatile by\r\nwhat it had dissolved.\r\n\r\nAs the bisulphide of carbon has a strong power of softening indurated\r\ncaoutchouc, I soaked in it during a short time several rootlets of a\r\nplant which had grown up a plaistered wall; and I then found many\r\nextremely thin threads of transparent, not viscid, excessively elastic\r\nmatter, precisely like caoutchouc, attached to two sets of rootlets on\r\nthe same branch.  These threads proceeded from the bark of the rootlet at\r\none end, and at the other end were firmly attached to particles of silex\r\nor mortar from the wall.  There could be no mistake in this observation,\r\nas I played with the threads for a long time under the microscope,\r\ndrawing them out with my dissecting-needles and letting them spring back\r\nagain.  Yet I looked repeatedly at other rootlets similarly treated, and\r\ncould never again discover these elastic threads.  I therefore infer that\r\nthe branch in question must have been slightly moved from the wall at\r\nsome critical period, whilst the secretion was in the act of drying,\r\nthrough the absorption of its watery parts.  The genus _Ficus_ abounds\r\nwith caoutchouc, and we may conclude from the facts just given that this\r\nsubstance, at first in solution and ultimately modified into an unelastic\r\ncement, {187} is used by the _Ficus repens_ to cement its rootlets to any\r\nsurface which it ascends.  Whether other plants, which climb by their\r\nrootlets, emit any cement I do not know; but the rootlets of the Ivy,\r\nplaced against glass, barely adhered to it, yet secreted a little\r\nyellowish matter.  I may add, that the rootlets of the _Marcgravia dubia_\r\ncan adhere firmly to smooth painted wood.\r\n\r\n_Vanilla aromatica_ emits aërial roots a foot in length, which point\r\nstraight down to the ground.  According to Mohl (p. 49), these crawl into\r\ncrevices, and when they meet with a thin support, wind round it, as do\r\ntendrils.  A plant which I kept was young, and did not form long roots;\r\nbut on placing thin sticks in contact with them, they certainly bent a\r\nlittle to that side, in the course of about a day, and adhered by their\r\nrootlets to the wood; but they did not bend quite round the sticks, and\r\nafterwards they re-pursued their downward course.  It is probable that\r\nthese slight movements of the roots are due to the quicker growth of the\r\nside exposed to the light, in comparison with the other side, and not\r\nbecause the roots are sensitive to contact in the same manner as true\r\ntendrils.  According to Mohl, the rootlets of certain species of\r\n_Lycopodium_ act as tendrils. {188}\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on Climbing Plants_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants become climbers, in order, as it may be presumed, to reach the\r\nlight, and to expose a large surface of their leaves to its action and to\r\nthat of the free air.  This is effected by climbers with wonderfully\r\nlittle expenditure of organized matter, in comparison with trees, which\r\nhave to support a load of heavy branches by a massive trunk.  Hence, no\r\ndoubt, it arises that there are so many climbing plants in all quarters\r\nof the world, belonging to so many different orders.  These plants have\r\nbeen arranged under four classes, disregarding those which merely\r\nscramble over bushes without any special aid.  Hook-climbers are the\r\nleast efficient of all, at least in our temperate countries, and can\r\nclimb only in the midst of an entangled mass of vegetation.\r\nRoot-climbers are excellently adapted to ascend naked faces of rock or\r\ntrunks of trees; when, however, they climb trunks they are compelled to\r\nkeep much in the shade; they cannot pass from branch to branch and thus\r\ncover the whole summit of a tree, for their rootlets require\r\nlong-continued and close contact with a steady surface in order to\r\nadhere.  The two great classes of twiners and of plants with sensitive\r\norgans, namely, leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers taken together, far\r\nexceed in number and in the perfection of their mechanism the climbers of\r\nthe two first classes.  Those which have the power of spontaneously\r\nrevolving and of grasping objects with which they come in contact, easily\r\npass from branch to branch, and securely ramble over a wide, sun-lit\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe divisions containing twining plants, leaf-climbers, and\r\ntendril-bearers graduate to a certain extent into one another, and nearly\r\nall have the same remarkable power of spontaneously revolving.  Does this\r\ngradation, it may be asked, indicate that plants belonging to one\r\nsubdivision have actually passed during the lapse of ages, or can pass,\r\nfrom one state to the other?  Has, for instance, any tendril-bearing\r\nplant assumed its present structure without having previously existed as\r\na leaf-climber or a twiner?  If we consider leaf-climbers alone, the idea\r\nthat they were primordially twiners is forcibly suggested.  The\r\ninternodes of all, without exception, revolve in exactly the same manner\r\nas twiners; some few can still twine well, and many others in an\r\nimperfect manner.  Several leaf-climbing genera are closely allied to\r\nother genera which are simple twiners.  It should also be observed, that\r\nthe possession of leaves with sensitive petioles, and with the consequent\r\npower of clasping an object, would be of comparatively little use to a\r\nplant, unless associated with revolving internodes, by which the leaves\r\nare brought into contact with a support; although no doubt a scrambling\r\nplant would be apt, as Professor Jaeger has remarked, to rest on other\r\nplants by its leaves.  On the other hand, revolving internodes, without\r\nany other aid, suffice to give the power of climbing; so that it seems\r\nprobable that leaf-climbers were in most cases at first twiners, and\r\nsubsequently became capable of grasping a support; and this, as we shall\r\npresently see, is a great additional advantage.\r\n\r\nFrom analogous reasons, it is probable that all tendril-bearers were\r\nprimordially twiners, that is, are the descendants of plants having this\r\npower and habit.  For the internodes of the majority revolve; and, in a\r\nfew species, the flexible stem still retains the capacity of spirally\r\ntwining round an upright stick.  Tendril-bearers have undergone much more\r\nmodification than leaf-climbers; hence it is not surprising that their\r\nsupposed primordial habits of revolving and twining have been more\r\nfrequently lost or modified than in the case of leaf-climbers.  The three\r\ngreat tendril-bearing families in which this loss has occurred in the\r\nmost marked manner, are the Cucurbitaceæ, Passifloraceæ, and Vitaceæ.  In\r\nthe first, the internodes revolve; but I have heard of no twining form,\r\nwith the exception (according to Palm, p. 29. 52) of _Momordica\r\nbalsamina_, and this is only an imperfect twiner.  In the two other\r\nfamilies I can hear of no twiners; and the internodes rarely have the\r\npower of revolving, this power being confined to the tendrils.  The\r\ninternodes, however, of _Passiflora gracilis_ have the power in a perfect\r\nmanner, and those of the common Vine in an imperfect degree: so that at\r\nleast a trace of the supposed primordial habit has been retained by some\r\nmembers of all the larger tendril-bearing groups.\r\n\r\nOn the view here given, it may be asked, Why have the species which were\r\naboriginally twiners been converted in so many groups into leaf-climbers\r\nor tendril-bearers?  Of what advantage has this been to them?  Why did\r\nthey not remain simple twiners?  We can see several reasons.  It might be\r\nan advantage to a plant to acquire a thicker stem, with short internodes\r\nbearing many or large leaves; and such stems are ill fitted for twining.\r\nAny one who will look during windy weather at twining plants will see\r\nthat they are easily blown from their support; not so with\r\ntendril-bearers or leaf-climbers, for they quickly and firmly grasp their\r\nsupport by a much more efficient kind of movement.  In those plants which\r\nstill twine, but at the same time possess tendrils or sensitive petioles,\r\nas some species of Bignonia, Clematis, and Tropæolum, it can readily be\r\nobserved how incomparably better they grasp an upright stick than do\r\nsimple twiners.  Tendrils, from possessing this power of grasping an\r\nobject, can be made long and thin; so that little organic matter is\r\nexpended in their development, and yet they sweep a wide circle in search\r\nof a support.  Tendril-bearers can, from their first growth, ascend along\r\nthe outer branches of any neighbouring bush, and they are thus always\r\nfully exposed to the light; twiners, on the contrary, are best fitted to\r\nascend bare stems, and generally have to start in the shade.  Within tall\r\nand dense tropical forests, twining plants would probably succeed better\r\nthan most kinds of tendril-bearers; but the majority of twiners, at least\r\nin our temperate regions, from the nature of their revolving movement,\r\ncannot ascend thick trunks, whereas this can be affected by\r\ntendril-bearers if the trunks are branched or bear twigs, and by some\r\nspecies if the bark is rugged.\r\n\r\nThe advantage gained by climbing is to reach the light and free air with\r\nas little expenditure of organic matter as possible; now, with twining\r\nplants, the stem is much longer than is absolutely necessary; for\r\ninstance, I measured the stem of a kidney-bean, which had ascended\r\nexactly two feet in height, and it was three feet in length: the stem of\r\na pea, on the other hand, which had ascended to the same height by the\r\naid of its tendrils, was but little longer than the height reached.  That\r\nthis saving of the stem is really an advantage to climbing plants, I\r\ninfer from the species that still twine but are aided by clasping\r\npetioles or tendrils, generally making more open spires than those made\r\nby simple twiners.  Moreover, the plants thus aided, after taking one or\r\ntwo turns in one direction, generally ascend for a space straight, and\r\nthen reverse the direction of their spire.  By this means they ascend to\r\na considerably greater height, with the same length of stem, than would\r\notherwise have been possible; and they do this with safety, as they\r\nsecure themselves at intervals by their clasping petioles or tendrils.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that tendrils consist of various organs in a modified state,\r\nnamely, leaves, flower-peduncles, branches, and perhaps stipules.  With\r\nrespect to leaves, the evidence of their modification is ample.  In young\r\nplants of Bignonia the lower leaves often remain quite unchanged, whilst\r\nthe upper ones have their terminal leaflets converted into perfect\r\ntendrils; in _Eccremocarpus_ I have seen a single lateral branch of a\r\ntendril replaced by a perfect leaflet; in _Vicia sativa_, on the other\r\nhand, leaflets are sometimes replaced by tendril-branches; and many other\r\nsuch cases could be given.  But he who believes in the slow modification\r\nof species will not be content simply to ascertain the homological nature\r\nof different kinds of tendrils; he will wish to learn, as far as is\r\npossible, by what actual steps leaves, flower-peduncles, &c., have had\r\ntheir functions wholly changed, and have come to serve merely as\r\nprehensile organs.\r\n\r\nIn the whole group of leaf-climbers abundant evidence has been given that\r\nan organ, still subserving the functions of a leaf, may become sensitive\r\nto a touch, and thus grasp an adjoining object.  With several\r\nleaf-climbers the true leaves spontaneously revolve; and their petioles,\r\nafter clasping a support grow thicker and stronger.  We thus see that\r\nleaves may acquire all the leading and characteristic qualities of\r\ntendrils, namely, sensitiveness, spontaneous movement, and subsequently\r\nincreased strength.  If their blades or laminæ were to abort, they would\r\nform true tendrils.  And of this process of abortion we can follow every\r\nstep, until no trace of the original nature of the tendril is left.  In\r\n_Mutisia clematis_, the tendril, in shape and colour, closely resembles\r\nthe petiole of one of the ordinary leaves, together with the midribs of\r\nthe leaflets, but vestiges of the laminæ are still occasionally retained.\r\nIn four genera of the Fumariaceæ we can follow the whole process of\r\ntransformation.  The terminal leaflets of the leaf-climbing _Fumaria\r\nofficinalis_ are not smaller than the other leaflets; those of the\r\nleaf-climbing _Adlumia cirrhosa_ are greatly reduced; those of _Corydalis\r\nclaviculata_ (a plant which may indifferently be called a leaf-climber or\r\na tendril-bearer) are either reduced to microscopical dimensions or have\r\ntheir blades wholly aborted, so that this plant is actually in a state of\r\ntransition; and, finally, in the _Dicentra_ the tendrils are perfectly\r\ncharacterized.  If, therefore, we could behold at the same time all the\r\nprogenitors of _Dicentra_, we should almost certainly see a series like\r\nthat now exhibited by the above-named three genera.  In _Tropæolum\r\ntricolorum_ we have another kind of passage; for the leaves which are\r\nfirst formed on the young stems are entirely destitute of laminæ, and\r\nmust be called tendrils, whilst the later formed leaves have\r\nwell-developed laminæ.  In all cases the acquirement of sensitiveness by\r\nthe mid-ribs of the leaves appears to stand in some close relation with\r\nthe abortion of their laminæ or blades.\r\n\r\nOn the view here given, leaf-climbers were primordially twiners, and\r\ntendril-bearers (when formed of modified leaves) were primordially\r\nleaf-climbers.  The latter, therefore, are intermediate in nature between\r\ntwiners and tendril-bearers, and ought to be related to both.  This is\r\nthe case: thus the several leaf-climbing species of the Antirrhineæ, of\r\nSolanum, Cocculus, and Gloriosa, have within the same family and even\r\nwithin the same genus, relatives which are twiners.  In the genus\r\nMikania, there are leaf-climbing and twining species.  The leaf-climbing\r\nspecies of Clematis are very closely allied to the tendril-bearing\r\nNaravelia.  The Fumariaceæ include closely allied genera which are\r\nleaf-climbers and tendril-bearers.  Lastly, a species of Bignonia is at\r\nthe same time both a leaf-climber and a tendril-bearer; and other closely\r\nallied species are twiners.\r\n\r\nTendrils of another kind consist of modified flower-peduncles.  In this\r\ncase we likewise have many interesting transitional states.  The common\r\nVine (not to mention the _Cardiospermum_) gives us every possible\r\ngradation between a perfectly developed tendril and a flower-peduncle\r\ncovered with flowers, yet furnished with a branch, forming the\r\nflower-tendril.  When the latter itself bears a few flowers, as we know\r\nsometimes is the case, and still retains the power of clasping a support,\r\nwe see an early condition of all those tendrils which have been formed by\r\nthe modification of flower-peduncles.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohl and others, some tendrils consist of modified branches:\r\nI have not observed any such cases, and know nothing of their\r\ntransitional states, but these have been fully described by Fritz Müller.\r\nThe genus Lophospermum also shows us how such a transition is possible;\r\nfor its branches spontaneously revolve and are sensitive to contact.\r\nHence, if the leaves on some of the branches of the Lophospermum were to\r\nabort, these branches would be converted into true tendrils.  Nor is\r\nthere anything improbable in certain branches alone being thus modified,\r\nwhilst others remained unaltered; for we have seen with certain varieties\r\nof _Phaseolus_, that some of the branches are thin, flexible, and twine,\r\nwhilst other branches on the same plant are stiff and have no such power.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire how a petiole, a branch or flower-peduncle first became\r\nsensitive to a touch, and acquired the power of bending towards the\r\ntouched side, we get no certain answer.  Nevertheless an observation by\r\nHofmeister {197} well deserves attention, namely, that the shoots and\r\nleaves of all plants, whilst young, move after being shaken.  Kerner also\r\nfinds, as we have seen, that the flower-peduncles of a large number of\r\nplants, if shaken or gently rubbed bend to this side.  And it is young\r\npetioles and tendrils, whatever their homological nature may be, which\r\nmove on being touched.  It thus appears that climbing plants have\r\nutilized and perfected a widely distributed and incipient capacity, which\r\ncapacity, as far as we can see, is of no service to ordinary plants.  If\r\nwe further inquire how the stems, petioles, tendrils, and\r\nflower-peduncles of climbing plants first acquired their power of\r\nspontaneously revolving, or, to speak more accurately, of successively\r\nbending to all points of the compass, we are again silenced, or at most\r\ncan only remark that the power of moving, both spontaneously and from\r\nvarious stimulants, is far more common with plants, than is generally\r\nsupposed to be the case by those who have not attended to the subject.  I\r\nhave given one remarkable instance, namely that of the _Maurandia\r\nsemperflorens_, the young flower-peduncles of which spontaneously revolve\r\nin very small circles, and bend when gently rubbed to the touched side;\r\nyet this plant certainly does not profit by these two feebly developed\r\npowers.  A rigorous examination of other young plants would probably show\r\nslight spontaneous movements in their stems, petioles or peduncles, as\r\nwell as sensitiveness to a touch. {198}  We see at least that the\r\n_Maurandia_ might, by a little augmentation of the powers which it\r\nalready possesses, come first to grasp a support by its flower-peduncles,\r\nand then, by the abortion of some of its flowers (as with _Vitis_ or\r\n_Cardiospermum_), acquire perfect tendrils.\r\n\r\nThere is one other interesting point which deserves notice.  We have seen\r\nthat some tendrils owe their origin to modified leaves, and others to\r\nmodified flower-peduncles; so that some are foliar and others axial in\r\ntheir nature.  It might therefore have been expected that they would have\r\npresented some difference in function.  This is not the case.  On the\r\ncontrary, they present the most complete identity in their several\r\ncharacteristic powers.  Tendrils of both kinds spontaneously revolve at\r\nabout the same rate.  Both, when touched, bend quickly to the touched\r\nside, and afterwards recover themselves and are able to act again.  In\r\nboth the sensitiveness is either confined to one side or extends all\r\nround the tendril.  Both are either attracted or repelled by the light.\r\nThe latter property is seen in the foliar tendrils of _Bignonia\r\ncapreolata_ and in the axial tendrils of _Ampelopsis_.  The tips of the\r\ntendrils in these two plants become, after contact, enlarged into discs,\r\nwhich are at first adhesive by the secretion of some cement.  Tendrils of\r\nboth kinds, soon after grasping a support, contract spirally; they then\r\nincrease greatly in thickness and strength.  When we add to these several\r\npoints of identity the fact that the petiole of _Solanum jasminoides_,\r\nafter it has clasped a support, assumes one of the most characteristic\r\nfeatures of the axis, namely, a closed ring of woody vessels, we can\r\nhardly avoid asking, whether the difference between foliar and axial\r\norgans can be of so fundamental a nature as is generally supposed? {199}\r\n\r\nWe have attempted to trace some of the stages in the genesis of climbing\r\nplants.  But, during the endless fluctuations of the conditions of life\r\nto which all organic beings have been exposed, it might be expected that\r\nsome climbing plants would have lost the habit of climbing.  In the cases\r\ngiven of certain South African plants belonging to great twining\r\nfamilies, which in their native country never twine, but reassume this\r\nhabit when cultivated in England, we have a case in point.  In the\r\nleaf-climbing _Clematis flammula_, and in the tendril-bearing Vine, we\r\nsee no loss in the power of climbing, but only a remnant of the revolving\r\npower which is indispensable to all twiners, and is so common as well as\r\nso advantageous to most climbers.  In _Tecoma radicans_, one of the\r\nBignoniaceæ, we see a last and doubtful trace of the power of revolving.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the abortion of tendrils, certain cultivated varieties of\r\n_Cucurbita pepo_ have, according to Naudin, {200} either quite lost these\r\norgans or bear semi-monstrous representatives of them.  In my limited\r\nexperience, I have met with only one apparent instance of their natural\r\nsuppression, namely, in the common bean.  All the other species of\r\n_Vicia_, I believe, bear tendrils; but the bean is stiff enough to\r\nsupport its own stem, and in this species, at the end of the petiole,\r\nwhere, according to analogy, a tendril ought to have existed, a small\r\npointed filament projects, about a third of an inch in length, and which\r\nis probably the rudiment of a tendril.  This may be the more safely\r\ninferred, as in young and unhealthy specimens of other tendril-bearing\r\nplants similar rudiments may occasionally be observed.  In the bean these\r\nfilaments are variable in shape, as is so frequently the case with\r\nrudimentary organs; they are either cylindrical, or foliaceous, or are\r\ndeeply furrowed on the upper surface.  They have not retained any vestige\r\nof the power of revolving.  It is a curious fact, that many of these\r\nfilaments, when foliaceous, have on their lower surfaces, dark-coloured\r\nglands like those on the stipules, which excrete a sweet fluid; so that\r\nthese rudiments have been feebly utilized.\r\n\r\nOne other analogous case, though hypothetical, is worth giving.  Nearly\r\nall the species of _Lathyrus_ possesses tendrils; but _L. nissolia_ is\r\ndestitute of them.  This plant has leaves, which must have struck\r\neveryone with surprise who has noticed them, for they are quite unlike\r\nthose of all common papilionaceous plants, and resemble those of a grass.\r\nIn another species, _L. aphaca_, the tendril, which is not highly\r\ndeveloped (for it is unbranched, and has no spontaneous revolving-power),\r\nreplaces the leaves, the latter being replaced in function by large\r\nstipules.  Now if we suppose the tendrils of _L. aphaca_ to become\r\nflattened and foliaceous, like the little rudimentary tendrils of the\r\nbean, and the large stipules to become at the same time reduced in size,\r\nfrom not being any longer wanted, we should have the exact counterpart of\r\n_L. nissolia_, and its curious leaves are at once rendered intelligible\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, as serving to sum up the foregoing views on the origin\r\nof tendril-bearing plants, that _L. nissolia_ is probably descended from\r\na plant which was primordially a twiner; this then became a leaf-climber,\r\nthe leaves being afterwards converted by degrees into tendrils, with the\r\nstipules greatly increased in size through the law of compensation. {202}\r\nAfter a time the tendrils lost their branches and became simple; they\r\nthen lost their revolving-power (in which state they would have resembled\r\nthe tendrils of the existing _L. aphaca_), and afterwards losing their\r\nprehensile power and becoming foliaceous would no longer be thus\r\ndesignated.  In this last stage (that of the existing _L. nissolia_) the\r\nformer tendrils would reassume their original function of leaves, and the\r\nstipules which were recently much developed being no longer wanted, would\r\ndecrease in size.  If species become modified in the course of ages, as\r\nalmost all naturalists now admit, we may conclude that _L. nissolia_ has\r\npassed through a series of changes, in some degree like those here\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point in the natural history of climbing plants is\r\nthe various kinds of movement which they display in manifest relation to\r\ntheir wants.  The most different organs—stems, branches,\r\nflower-peduncles, petioles, mid-ribs of the leaf and leaflets, and\r\napparently aërial roots—all possess this power.\r\n\r\nThe first action of a tendril is to place itself in a proper position.\r\nFor instance, the tendril of Cobæa first rises vertically up, with its\r\nbranches divergent and with the terminal hooks turned outwards; the young\r\nshoot at the extremity of the stem is at the same time bent to one side,\r\nso as to be out of the way.  The young leaves of Clematis, on the other\r\nhand, prepare for action by temporarily curving themselves downwards, so\r\nas to serve as grapnels.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if a twining plant or a tendril gets by any accident into an\r\ninclined position, it soon bends upwards, though secluded from the light.\r\nThe guiding stimulus no doubt is the attraction of gravity, as Andrew\r\nKnight showed to be the case with germinating plants.  If a shoot of any\r\nordinary plant be placed in an inclined position in a glass of water in\r\nthe dark, the extremity will, in a few hours, bend upwards; and if the\r\nposition of the shoot be then reversed, the downward-bent shoot reverses\r\nits curvature; but if the stolen of a strawberry, which has no tendency\r\nto grow upwards, be thus treated, it will curve downwards in the\r\ndirection of, instead of in opposition to, the force of gravity.  As with\r\nthe strawberry, so it is generally with the twining shoots of the\r\n_Hibbertia dentata_, which climbs laterally from bush to bush; for these\r\nshoots, if placed in a position inclined downwards, show little and\r\nsometimes no tendency to curve upwards.\r\n\r\nThirdly, climbing plants, like other plants, bend towards the light by a\r\nmovement closely analogous to the incurvation which causes them to\r\nrevolve, so that their revolving movement is often accelerated or\r\nretarded in travelling to or from the light.  On the other hand, in a few\r\ninstances tendrils bend towards the dark.\r\n\r\nFourthly, we have the spontaneous revolving movement which is independent\r\nof any outward stimulus, but is contingent on the youth of the part, and\r\non vigorous health; and this again of course depends on a proper\r\ntemperature and other favourable conditions of life.\r\n\r\nFifthly, tendrils, whatever their homological nature may be, and the\r\npetioles or tips of the leaves of leaf-climbers, and apparently certain\r\nroots, all have the power of movement when touched, and bend quickly\r\ntowards the touched side.  Extremely slight pressure often suffices.  If\r\nthe pressure be not permanent, the part in question straightens itself\r\nand is again ready to bend on being touched.\r\n\r\nSixthly, and lastly, tendrils, soon after clasping a support, but not\r\nafter a mere temporary curvature, contract spirally.  If they have not\r\ncome into contact with any object, they ultimately contract spirally,\r\nafter ceasing to revolve; but in this case the movement is useless, and\r\noccurs only after a considerable lapse of time.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the means by which these various movements are effected,\r\nthere can be little doubt from the researches of Sachs and H. de Vries,\r\nthat they are due to unequal growth; but from the reasons already\r\nassigned, I cannot believe that this explanation applies to the rapid\r\nmovements from a delicate touch.\r\n\r\nFinally, climbing plants are sufficiently numerous to form a conspicuous\r\nfeature in the vegetable kingdom, more especially in tropical forests.\r\nAmerica, which so abounds with arboreal animals, as Mr. Bates remarks,\r\nlikewise abounds according to Mohl and Palm with climbing plants; and of\r\nthe tendril-bearing plants examined by me, the highest developed kinds\r\nare natives of this grand continent, namely, the several species of\r\n_Bignonia_, _Eccremocarpus_, _Cobæa_, and _Ampelopsis_.  But even in the\r\nthickets of our temperate regions the number of climbing species and\r\nindividuals is considerable, as will be found by counting them.  They\r\nbelong to many and widely different orders.  To gain some rude idea of\r\ntheir distribution in the vegetable series, I marked, from the lists\r\ngiven by Mohl and Palm (adding a few myself, and a competent botanist, no\r\ndoubt, could have added many more), all those families in Lindley’s\r\n‘Vegetable Kingdom’ which include twiners, leaf-climbers, or\r\ntendril-bearers.  Lindley divides Phanerogamic plants into fifty-nine\r\nAlliances; of these, no less than thirty-five include climbing plants of\r\nthe above kinds, hook and root-climbers being excluded.  To these a few\r\nCryptogamic plants must be added.  When we reflect on the wide separation\r\nof these plants in the series, and when we know that in some of the\r\nlargest, well-defined orders, such as the Compositæ, Rubiaceæ,\r\nScrophulariaceæ, Liliaceæ, &c., species in only two or three genera have\r\nthe power of climbing, the conclusion is forced on our minds that the\r\ncapacity of revolving, on which most climbers depend, is inherent, though\r\nundeveloped, in almost every plant in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt has often been vaguely asserted that plants are distinguished from\r\nanimals by not having the power of movement.  It should rather be said\r\nthat plants acquire and display this power only when it is of some\r\nadvantage to them; this being of comparatively rare occurrence, as they\r\nare affixed to the ground, and food is brought to them by the air and\r\nrain.  We see how high in the scale of organization a plant may rise,\r\nwhen we look at one of the more perfect tendril-bearers.  It first places\r\nits tendrils ready for action, as a polypus places its tentacula.  If the\r\ntendril be displaced, it is acted on by the force of gravity and rights\r\nit self.  It is acted on by the light, and bends towards or from it, or\r\ndisregards it, whichever may be most advantageous.  During several days\r\nthe tendrils or internodes, or both, spontaneously revolve with a steady\r\nmotion.  The tendril strikes some object, and quickly curls round and\r\nfirmly grasps it.  In the course of some hours it contracts into a spire,\r\ndragging up the stem, and forming an excellent spring.  All movements now\r\ncease.  By growth the tissues soon become wonderfully strong and durable.\r\nThe tendril has done its work, and has done it in an admirable manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n{iv}  An English translation of the ‘Lehrbuch der Botanik’ by Professor\r\nSachs, has recently (1875), appeared under the title of ‘Text-Book of\r\nBotany,’ and this is a great boon to all lovers of natural science in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n{1a}  ‘Proc.

Instituts in Würzburg,’ Heft iii. pp. 331, 336.\r\nSee also Sachs (‘Text-Book of Botany,’ English translation, 1875, p.\r\n770), who concludes “that torsion is the result of growth continuing in\r\nthe outer layers after it has ceased or begun to cease in the inner\r\nlayers.”\r\n\r\n{9b}  Professor Asa Gray has remarked to me, in a letter, that in _Thuja\r\noccidentalis_ the twisting of the bark is very conspicuous.  The twist is\r\ngenerally to the right of the observer; but, in noticing about a hundred\r\ntrunks, four or five were observed to be twisted in an opposite\r\ndirection.  The Spanish chestnut is often much twisted: there is an\r\ninteresting article on this subject in the ‘Scottish Farmer,’ 1865, p.\r\n833.\r\n\r\n{10}  It is well known that the stems of many plants occasionally become\r\nspirally twisted in a monstrous manner; and after my paper was read\r\nbefore the Linnean Society, Dr. Maxwell Masters remarked to me in a\r\nletter that “some of these cases, if not all, are dependent upon some\r\nobstacle or resistance to their upward growth.”  This conclusion agrees\r\nwith what I have said about the twisting of stems, which have twined\r\nround rugged supports; but does not preclude the twisting being of\r\nservice to the plant by giving greater rigidity to the stem.\r\n\r\n{12}  The view that the revolving movement or nutation of the stems of\r\ntwining plants is due to growth is that advanced by Sachs and H. de\r\nVries; and the truth of this view is proved by their excellent\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n{14} The mechanism by which the end of the shoot remains hooked appears\r\nto be a difficult and complex problem, discussed by Dr. H. de Vries\r\n(ibid. p. 337): he concludes that “it depends on the relation between the\r\nrapidity of torsion and the rapidity of nutation.”\r\n\r\n{16}  Dr. H. de Vries also has shown (ibid. p. 321 and 325) by a better\r\nmethod than that employed by me, that the stems of twining plants are not\r\nirritable, and that the cause of their winding up a support is exactly\r\nwhat I have described.\r\n\r\n{17}  Dr. H. de Vries states (ibid. p. 322) that the stem of Cuscuta is\r\nirritable like a tendril.\r\n\r\n{18}  See Dr. H. de Vries (ibid.  p. 324) on this subject.\r\n\r\n{19}  Comptes Rendus, 1844, tom. xix. p. 295, and Annales des Sc. Nat 3rd\r\nseries, Bot., tom. ii. p. 163.\r\n\r\n{24}  I am much indebted to Dr. Hooker for having sent me many plants\r\nfrom Kew; and to Mr. Veitch, of the Royal Exotic Nursery, for having\r\ngenerously given me a collection of fine specimens of climbing plants.\r\nProfessor Asa Gray, Prof. Oliver, and Dr. Hooker have afforded me, as on\r\nmany previous occasions, much information and many references.\r\n\r\n{33}  Journal of the Linn. Soc. (Bot.) vol. ix. p. 344.  I shall have\r\noccasion often to quote this interesting paper, in which he corrects or\r\nconfirms various statements made by me.\r\n\r\n{34}  I raised nine plants of the hybrid _Loasa Herbertii_, and six of\r\nthese also reversed their spire in ascending a support.\r\n\r\n{36}  In another genus, namely Davilla, belonging to the same family with\r\nHibbertia, Fritz Müller says (ibid. p. 349) that “the stem twines\r\nindifferently from left to right, or from right to left; and I once saw a\r\nshoot which ascended a tree about five inches in diameter, reverse its\r\ncourse in the same manner as so frequently occurs with Loasa.”\r\n\r\n{37}  Fritz Müller states (ibid. p. 349) that he saw on one occasion in\r\nthe forests of South Brazil a trunk about five feet in circumference\r\nspirally ascended by a plant, apparently belonging to the Menispermaceæ.\r\nHe adds in his letter to me that most of the climbing plants which there\r\nascend thick trees, are root-climbers; some being tendril-bearers.\r\n\r\n{44}  Fritz Müller has published some interesting facts and views on the\r\nstructure of the wood of climbing plants in ‘Bot. Zeitung,’ 1866, pp. 57,\r\n66.\r\n\r\n{68}  It appears from A. Kerner’s interesting observations, that the\r\nflower-peduncles of a large number of plants are irritable, and bend when\r\nthey are rubbed or shaken: Die Schutzmittel des Pollens, 1873, p. 34.\r\n\r\n{71}  I have already referred to the case of the twining stem of Cuscuta,\r\nwhich, according to H. de Vries (ibid. p. 322) is sensitive to a touch\r\nlike a tendril.\r\n\r\n{75}  Dr. Maxwell Masters informs me that in almost all petioles which\r\nare cylindrical, such as those bearing peltate leaves, the woody vessels\r\nform a closed ring; semilunar bands of vessels being confined to petioles\r\nwhich are channelled along their upper surfaces.  In accordance with this\r\nstatement, it may be observed that the enlarged and clasped petiole of\r\nthe _Solanum_, with its closed ring of woody vessels, has become more\r\ncylindrical than it was in its original unclasped condition.\r\n\r\n{84}  Never having had the opportunity of examining tendrils produced by\r\nthe modification of branches, I spoke doubtfully about them in this essay\r\nwhen originally published.  But since then Fritz Müller has described\r\n(Journal of Linn. Soc. vol. ix. p. 344) many striking cases in South\r\nBrazil.  In speaking of plants which climb by the aid of their branches,\r\nmore or less modified, he states that the following stages of development\r\ncan be traced: (1.) Plants supporting themselves simply by their branches\r\nstretched out at right angles—for example, _Chiococca_.  (2.) Plants\r\nclasping a support with their unmodified branches, as with _Securidaca_.\r\n(3.) Plants climbing by the extremities of their branches which appear\r\nlike tendrils, as is the case according to Endlicher with _Helinus_.\r\n(4.) Plants with their branches much modified and temporarily converted\r\ninto tendrils, but which may be again transformed into branches, as with\r\ncertain Papilionaceous plants.  (5.) Plants with their branches forming\r\ntrue tendrils, and used exclusively for climbing—as with _Strychnos_ and\r\n_Caulotretus_.  Even the unmodified branches become much thickened when\r\nthey wind round a support.  I may add that Mr. Thwaites sent me from\r\nCeylon a specimen of an Acacia which had climbed up the trunk of a rather\r\nlarge tree, by the aid of tendril-like, curved or convoluted branchlets,\r\narrested in their growth and furnished with sharp recurved hooks.\r\n\r\n{85}  As far as I can make out, the history of our knowledge of tendrils\r\nis as follows:—We have seen that Palm and von Mohl observed about the\r\nsame time the singular phenomenon of the spontaneous revolving movement\r\nof twining-plants.  Palm (p. 58), I presume, observed likewise the\r\nrevolving movement of tendrils; but I do not feel sure of this, for he\r\nsays very little on the subject.  Dutrochet fully described this movement\r\nof the tendril in the common pea.  Mohl first discovered that tendrils\r\nare sensitive to contact; but from some cause, probably from observing\r\ntoo old tendrils, he was not aware how sensitive they were, and thought\r\nthat prolonged pressure was necessary to excite their movement.\r\nProfessor Asa Gray, in a paper already quoted, first noticed the extreme\r\nsensitiveness and rapidity of the movements of the tendrils of certain\r\nCucurbitaceous plants.\r\n\r\n{102}  Fritz Müller states (ibid. p. 348) that in South Brazil the trifid\r\ntendrils of Haplolophium, (one of the Bignoniaceæ) without having come\r\ninto contact with any object, terminate in smooth shining discs.  These,\r\nhowever, after adhering to any object, sometimes become considerably\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\n{111}  Comptes Rendus, tom. xvii. 1843, p. 989.\r\n\r\n{113}  Diagram showing the movement of the upper internode of the common\r\nPea, traced on a hemispherical glass, and transferred to paper; reduced\r\none-half in size (Aug. 1st)\r\n\r\nNo.        H.

In\r\nthe Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France, 1857, there are numerous\r\ndiscussions on the nature of the tendrils in this family.\r\n\r\n{127b}  ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle,’ 1864, p. 721.  From the affinity of the\r\nCucurbitaceæ to the Passifloraceæ, it might be argued that the tendrils\r\nof the former are modified flower-peduncles, as is certainly the case\r\nwith those of Passion flowers.  Mr. R. Holland (Hardwicke’s\r\n‘Science-Gossip,’ 1865, p. 105) states that “a cucumber grew, a few years\r\nago in my own garden, where one of the short prickles upon the fruit had\r\ngrown out into a long, curled tendril.”\r\n\r\n{145}  Trans. Phil. Soc. 1812, p. 314.\r\n\r\n{146}  Dr. M’Nab remarks (Trans. Bot. Soc. Edinburgh, vol xi. p. 292)\r\nthat the tendrils of _Amp. Veitchii_ bear small globular discs before\r\nthey have came into contact with any object; and I have since observed\r\nthe same fact.  These discs, however, increase greatly in size, if they\r\npress against and adhere to any surface.  The tendrils, therefore, of one\r\nspecies of _Ampelopsis_ require the stimulus of contact for the first\r\ndevelopment of their discs, whilst those of another species do not need\r\nany such stimulus.  We have seen an exactly parallel case with two\r\nspecies of _Bignoniaceæ_.\r\n\r\n{152}  Fritz Müller remarks (ibid. p. 348) that a related genus,\r\nSerjania, differs from Cardiospermum in bearing only a single tendril;\r\nand that the common peduncle contracts spirally, when, as frequently\r\nhappens, the tendril has clasped the plant’s own stem.\r\n\r\n{154}  Prof. Asa Gray informs me that the tendrils of _P. sicyoides_\r\nrevolve even at a quicker rate than those of _P. gracilis_; four\r\nrevolutions were completed (the temperature varying from 88 degrees-92\r\ndegrees Fahr.) in the following times, 40 m., 45 m., 38½ m., and 46 m.\r\nOne half-revolution was performed in 15 m.\r\n\r\n{165}  See M. Isid. Léon in Bull. Soc. Bot. de France, tom. v. 1858, p.\r\n650.  Dr. H. de Vries points out (p. 306) that I have overlooked, in the\r\nfirst edition of this essay, the following sentence by Mohl: “After a\r\ntendril has caught a support, it begins in some days to wind into a\r\nspire, which, since the tendril is made fast at both extremities, must of\r\nnecessity be in some places to the right, in others to the left.”  But I\r\nam not surprised that this brief sentence, without any further\r\nexplanation did not attract my attention.\r\n\r\n{176}  Sachs, however (‘Text-Book of Botany,’ Eng. Translation, 1875, p.\r\n280), has shown that which I overlooked, namely, that the tendrils of\r\ndifferent species are adapted to clasp supports of different thicknesses.\r\nHe further shows that after a tendril has clasped a support it\r\nsubsequently tightens its hold.\r\n\r\n{179}  Annales des Sc. Nat. Bot. 4th series, tom. xii. p. 89.\r\n\r\n{180}  It occurred to me that the movement of notation and that from a\r\ntouch might be differently affected by anæsthetics, in the same manner as\r\nPaul Bert has shown to be the case with the sleep-movements of Mimosa and\r\nthose from a touch.  I tried the common pea and _Passiflora gracilis_,\r\nbut I succeeded only in observing that both movements were unaffected by\r\nexposure for 1½ hrs. to a rather large dose of sulphuric ether.  In this\r\nrespect they present a wonderful contrast with Drosera, owing no doubt to\r\nthe presence of absorbent glands in the latter plant.\r\n\r\n{181}  Text-Book of Botany, 1875, p. 779.\r\n\r\n{183} Journal of Linn. Soc. vol. ix. p. 348.  Professor G. Jaeger has\r\nwell remarked (‘In Sachen Darwin’s, insbesondere contra Wigand,’ 1874, p.\r\n106) that it is highly characteristic of climbing plants to produce thin,\r\nelongated, and flexible stems.  He further remarks that plants growing\r\nbeneath other and taller species or trees, are naturally those which\r\nwould be developed into climbers; anti such plants, from stretching\r\ntowards the light, and from not being much agitated by the wind, tend to\r\nproduce long, thin and flexible shoots.\r\n\r\n{184}  Professor Asa Gray has explained, as it would appear, this\r\ndifficulty in his review (American Journal of Science, vol. xl. Sept.\r\n1865, p. 282) of the present work.  He has observed that the strong\r\nsummer shoots of the Michigan rose (_Rosa setigera_) are strongly\r\ndisposed to push into dark crevices and away from the light, so that they\r\nwould be almost sure to place themselves under a trellis.  He adds that\r\nthe lateral shoots, made on the following spring emerged from the trellis\r\nas they sought the light.\r\n\r\n{187}  Mr. Spiller has recently shown (Chemical Society, Feb. 16, 1865),\r\nin a paper on the oxidation of india-rubber or caoutchouc, that this\r\nsubstance, when exposed in a fine state of division to the air, gradually\r\nbecomes converted into brittle, resinous matter, very similar to\r\nshell-lac.\r\n\r\n{188}  Fritz Müller informs me that he saw in the forests of South Brazil\r\nnumerous black strings, from some lines to nearly an inch in diameter,\r\nwinding spirally round the trunks of gigantic trees.  At first sight he\r\nthought that they were the stems of twining plants which were thus\r\nascending the trees: but he afterwards found that they were the aërial\r\nroots of a Philodendron which grew on the branches above.  These roots\r\ntherefore seem to be true twiners, though they use their powers to\r\ndescend, instead of to ascend like twining plants.  The aërial roots of\r\nsome other species of Philodendron hang vertically downwards, sometimes\r\nfor a length of more than fifty feet.\r\n\r\n{197}  Quoted by Cohn, in his remarkable memoir, “Contractile Gewebe im\r\nPflanzenreiche,” ‘Abhandl. der Schlesischen Gesell.  1861, Heft i. s. 35.\r\n\r\n{198}  Such slight spontaneous movements, I now find, have been for some\r\ntime known to occur, for instance with the flower-stems of _Brassica\r\nnapus_ and with the leaves of many plants: Sachs’ ‘Text-Book of Botany’\r\n1875, pp. 766, 785.  Fritz Müller also has shown in relation to our\r\npresent subject (‘Jenaischen Zeitschrift,’ Bd. V. Heft 2, p. 133) that\r\nthe stems, whilst young, of an Alisma and of a Linum are continually\r\nperforming slight movements to all points of the compass, like those of\r\nclimbing plants.\r\n\r\n{199}  Mr. Herbert Spencer has recently argued (‘Principles of Biology,’\r\n1865, p. 37 et seq.) with much force that there is no fundamental\r\ndistinction between the foliar and axial organs of plants.\r\n\r\n{200}  Annales des Sc. Nat. 4th series, Bot. tom. vi. 1856, p. 31.\r\n\r\n{202}  Moquin-Tandon (Eléments de Tératologie. 1841, p. 156) gives the\r\ncase of a monstrous bean, in which a case of compensation of this nature\r\nwas suddenly effected; for the leaves completely disappeared and the\r\nstipules grew to an enormous size.",
