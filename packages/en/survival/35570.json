LECKS AND MRS. ALESHINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CASTING AWAY OF MRS. LECKS AND MRS. ALESHINE\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\nI was on my way from San Francisco to Yokohama, when in a very desultory\r\nand gradual manner I became acquainted with Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.\r\nAleshine. The steamer, on which I was making a moderately rapid passage\r\ntoward the land of the legended fan and the lacquered box, carried a\r\nfair complement of passengers, most of whom were Americans; and, among\r\nthese, my attention was attracted from the very first day of the voyage\r\nto two middle-aged women who appeared to me very unlike the ordinary\r\ntraveler or tourist. At first sight they might have been taken for\r\nfarmers' wives who, for some unusual reason, had determined to make a\r\nvoyage across the Pacific; but, on closer observation, one would have\r\nbeen more apt to suppose that they belonged to the families of\r\nprosperous tradesmen in some little country town, where, besides the\r\narts of rural housewifery, there would be opportunities of becoming\r\nacquainted in some degree with the ways and manners of the outside\r\nworld. They were not of that order of persons who generally take\r\nfirst-class passages on steamships, but the stateroom occupied by Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine was one of the best in the vessel; and although\r\nthey kept very much to themselves, and showed no desire for the company\r\nor notice of the other passengers, they evidently considered themselves\r\nquite as good as any one else, and with as much right to voyage to any\r\npart of the world in any manner or style which pleased them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks was a rather tall woman, large-boned and muscular, and her\r\nwell-browned countenance gave indications of that conviction of\r\nsuperiority which gradually grows up in the minds of those who for a\r\nlong time have had absolute control of the destinies of a state, or the\r\nmultifarious affairs of a country household. Mrs. Aleshine was somewhat\r\nyounger than her friend, somewhat shorter, and a great deal fatter. She\r\nhad the same air of reliance upon her individual worth that\r\ncharacterized Mrs. Lecks, but there was a certain geniality about her\r\nwhich indicated that she would have a good deal of forbearance for those\r\nwho never had had the opportunity or the ability of becoming the\r\nthoroughly good housewife which she was herself.\r\n\r\nThese two worthy dames spent the greater part of their time on deck,\r\nwhere they always sat together in a place at the stern of the vessel\r\nwhich was well sheltered from wind and weather. As they sat thus they\r\nwere generally employed in knitting, although this occupation did not\r\nprevent them from keeping up what seemed to me, as I passed them in my\r\nwalks about the deck, a continuous conversation. From a question which\r\nMrs. Lecks once asked me about a distant sail, our acquaintance began.\r\nThere was no one on board for whose society I particularly cared, and as\r\nthere was something quaint and odd about these countrywomen on the ocean\r\nwhich interested me, I was glad to vary my solitary promenades by an\r\noccasional chat with them. They were not at all backward in giving me\r\ninformation about themselves. They were both widows, and Mrs. Aleshine\r\nwas going out to Japan to visit a son who had a position there in a\r\nmercantile house. Mrs. Lecks had no children, and was accompanying her\r\nfriend because, as she said, she would not allow Mrs. Aleshine to make\r\nsuch a voyage as that by herself, and because, being quite able to do\r\nso, she did not know why she should not see the world as well as other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThese two friends were not educated women. They made frequent mistakes\r\nin their grammar, and a good deal of Middle States provincialism showed\r\nitself in their pronunciation and expressions. But although they brought\r\nmany of their rural ideas to sea with them, they possessed a large share\r\nof that common sense which is available anywhere, and they frequently\r\nmade use of it in a manner which was very amusing to me. I think, also,\r\nthat they found in me a quarry of information concerning nautical\r\nmatters, foreign countries, and my own affairs, the working of which\r\nhelped to make us very good ship friends.\r\n\r\nOur steamer touched at the Sandwich Islands; and it was a little more\r\nthan two days after we left Honolulu that, about nine o'clock in the\r\nevening, we had the misfortune to come into collision with an\r\neastern-bound vessel. The fault was entirely due to the other ship, the\r\nlookout on which, although the night was rather dark and foggy, could\r\neasily have seen our lights in time to avoid collision, if he had not\r\nbeen asleep or absent from his post. Be this as it may, this vessel,\r\nwhich appeared to be a small steamer, struck us with great force near\r\nour bows, and then, backing, disappeared into the fog, and we never saw\r\nor heard of her again. The general opinion was that she was injured very\r\nmuch more than we were, and that she probably sank not very long after\r\nthe accident; for when the fog cleared away, about an hour afterward,\r\nnothing could be seen of her lights.\r\n\r\nAs it usually happens on occasions of accidents at sea, the damage to\r\nour vessel was at first reported to be slight; but it was soon\r\ndiscovered that our injuries were serious and, indeed, disastrous. The\r\nhull of our steamer had been badly shattered on the port bow, and the\r\nwater came in at a most alarming rate. For nearly two hours the crew and\r\nmany of the passengers worked at the pumps, and everything possible was\r\ndone to stop the enormous leak; but all labor to save the vessel was\r\nfound to be utterly unavailing, and a little before midnight the captain\r\nannounced that it was impossible to keep the steamer afloat, and that we\r\nmust all take to the boats. The night was now clear, the stars were\r\nbright, and, as there was but little wind, the sea was comparatively\r\nsmooth. With all these advantages, the captain assured us that there was\r\nno reason to apprehend danger, and he thought that by noon of the\r\nfollowing day we could easily make a small inhabited island, where we\r\ncould be sheltered and cared for until we should be taken off by some\r\npassing vessel.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of time for all necessary preparations, and these were\r\nmade with much order and subordination. Some of the ladies among the\r\ncabin passengers were greatly frightened, and inclined to be hysterical.\r\nThere were pale faces also among the gentlemen. But everybody obeyed the\r\ncaptain's orders, and all prepared themselves for the transfer to the\r\nboats. The first officer came among us, and told each of us what boats\r\nwe were to take, and where we were to place ourselves on deck. I was\r\nassigned to a large boat which was to be principally occupied by\r\nsteerage passengers; and as I came up from my stateroom, where I had\r\ngone to secure my money and some portable valuables, I met on the\r\ncompanionway Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, who expressed considerable\r\ndissatisfaction when they found that I was not going in the boat with\r\nthem. They, however, hurried below, and I went on deck, where in about\r\nten minutes I was joined by Mrs. Lecks, who apparently had been looking\r\nfor me. She told me she had something very particular to say to me, and\r\nconducted me toward the stern of the vessel, where, behind one of the\r\ndeck-houses, we found Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'DO YOU SEE THAT BOAT THERE?'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" said Mrs. Lecks, leading me to the rail, and pointing\r\ndownward; \"do you see that boat there? It has been let down, and there\r\nis nobody in it. The boat on the other side has just gone off, full to\r\nthe brim. I never saw so many people crowded into a boat. The other ones\r\nwill be just as packed, I expect. I don't see why we shouldn't take this\r\nempty boat, now we've got a chance, instead of squeezin' ourselves into\r\nthose crowded ones. If any of the other people come afterward, why, we\r\nshall have our choice of seats, and that's considerable of a p'int, I\r\nshould say, in a time like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"and me and Mrs. Lecks would 'a' got\r\nright in when we saw the boat was empty, if we hadn't been afraid to be\r\nthere without any man, for it might have floated off, and neither of us\r\ndon't know nothin' about rowin'. And then Mrs. Lecks she thought of you,\r\nsupposin' a young man who knew so much about the sea would know how to\r\nrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said I; \"but I cannot imagine why this boat should have been\r\nleft empty. I see a keg of water in it, and the oars, and some tin cans,\r\nand so I suppose it has been made ready for somebody. Will you wait here\r\na minute until I run forward and see how things are going on there?\"\r\n\r\nAmidships and forward I saw that there was some confusion among the\r\npeople who were not yet in their boats, and I found that there was to be\r\nrather more crowding than at first was expected. People who had supposed\r\nthat they were to go in a certain boat found there no place, and were\r\nhurrying to other boats. It now became plain to me that no time should\r\nbe lost in getting into the small boat which Mrs. Lecks had pointed out,\r\nand which was probably reserved for some favored persons, as the\r\nofficers were keeping the people forward and amidships, the other\r\nstern-boat having already departed. But as I acknowledged no reason why\r\nany one should be regarded with more favor than myself and the two women\r\nwho were waiting for me, I slipped quietly aft, and joined Mrs. Lecks\r\nand Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"We must get in as soon as we can,\" said I, in a low voice, \"for this\r\nboat may be discovered, and then there will be a rush for it. I suspect\r\nit may have been reserved for the captain and some of the officers, but\r\nwe have as much right in it as they.\"\r\n\r\n\"And more too,\" replied Mrs. Lecks; \"for we had nothin' to do with the\r\nsteerin' and smashin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we goin' to get down there?\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"There's\r\nno steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said I. \"I shouldn't wonder if this boat is to be taken\r\nforward when the others are filled. We must scramble down as well as we\r\ncan by the tackle at the bow and stern. I'll get in first and keep her\r\nclose to the ship's side.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's goin' to be a scratchy business,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"and I'm of\r\nthe opinion we ought to wait till the ship has sunk a little more, so we\r\n'll be nearer to the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't do to wait,\" said I, \"or we shall not get in it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And goodness gracious!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, \"I can't stand here\r\nand feel the ship sinkin' cold-blooded under me, till we've got where we\r\ncan make an easy jump!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"we won't wait. But the first thing\r\nto be done is for each one of us to put on one of these life-preservers.\r\nTwo of them I brought from Mrs. Aleshine's and my cabin, and the other\r\none I got next door, where the people had gone off and left it on the\r\nfloor. I thought if anythin' happened on the way to the island, these\r\nwould give us a chance to look about us; but it seems to me we'll need\r\n'em more gettin' down them ropes than anywhere else. I did intend\r\nputtin' on two myself to make up for Mrs. Aleshine's fat; but you must\r\nwear one of 'em, sir, now that you are goin' to join the party.\"\r\n\r\nAs I knew that two life-preservers would not be needed by Mrs. Lecks,\r\nand would greatly inconvenience her, I accepted the one offered me, but\r\ndeclined to put it on until it should be necessary, as it would\r\ninterfere with my movements.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"if you think you are safe in gettin' down\r\nwithout it. But Mrs. Aleshine and me will put ours on before we begin\r\nsailor-scramblin'. We know how to do it, for we tried 'em on soon after\r\nwe started from San Francisco. And now, Barb'ry Aleshine, are you sure\r\nyou've got everythin' you want? for it'll be no use thinkin' about\r\nanythin' you've forgot after the ship has sunk out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothin' else I can think of,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"at least,\r\nnothin' I can carry; and so I suppose we may as well begin, for your\r\ntalk of the ship sinkin' under our feet gives me a sort o' feelin' like\r\nan oyster creepin' up and down my back.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks looked over the side at the boat, into which I had already\r\ndescended. \"I'll go first, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said she, \"and show you\r\nhow.\"\r\n\r\nThe sea was quiet, and the steamer had already sunk so much that Mrs.\r\nLecks's voice sounded frightfully near me, although she spoke in a low\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Watch me,\" said she to her companion. \"I'm goin' to do just as he did,\r\nand you must follow in the same way.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she stepped on a bench by the rail; then, with one foot on\r\nthe rail itself, she seized the ropes which hung from one of the davits\r\nto the bow of the boat. She looked down for a moment, and then she drew\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" she said. \"We must wait until she sinks more, and I can\r\nget in easier.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark made me feel nervous. I did not know at what moment there\r\nmight be a rush for this boat, nor when, indeed, the steamer might go\r\ndown. The boat amidships on our side had rowed away some minutes before,\r\nand through the darkness I could distinguish another boat, near the\r\nbows, pushing off. It would be too late now for us to try to get into\r\nany other boat, and I did not feel that there was time enough for me to\r\ntake this one to a place where the two women could more easily descend\r\nto her. Standing upright, I urged them not to delay.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said I, \"I can reach you as soon as you swing yourself off\r\nthe ropes, and I'll help you down.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you're sure you can keep us from comin' down too sudden, we'll try\r\nit,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"but I'd as soon be drowned as to get to an island\r\nwith a broken leg. And as to Mrs. Aleshine, if she was to slip she'd go\r\nslam through that boat to the bottom of the sea. Now, then, be ready!\r\nI'm comin' down.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she swung herself off, and she was then so near me that I was\r\nable to seize her and make the rest of her descent comparatively easy.\r\nMrs. Aleshine proved to be a more difficult subject. Even after I had a\r\nfirm grasp of her capacious waist she refused to let go the ropes, for\r\nfear that she might drop into the ocean instead of the boat. But the\r\nreproaches of Mrs. Lecks and the downward weight of myself made her\r\nloosen her nervous grip; and, although we came very near going overboard\r\ntogether, I safely placed her on one of the thwarts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI now unhooked the tackle from the stern; but before casting off at the\r\nbow I hesitated, for I did not wish to desert any of those who might be\r\nexpecting to embark in this boat. But I could hear no approaching\r\nfootsteps, and from my position, close to the side of the steamer, I\r\ncould see nothing. Therefore I cast off, and, taking the oars, I pushed\r\naway and rowed to a little distance, where I could get whatever view was\r\npossible of the deck of the steamer. Seeing no forms moving about, I\r\ncalled out, and, receiving no answer, I shouted again at the top of my\r\nvoice. I waited for nearly a minute, and, hearing nothing and seeing\r\nnothing, I became convinced that no one was left on the vessel.\r\n\r\n\"They are all gone,\" said I, \"and we will pull after them as fast as we\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I began to row toward the bow of the steamer, in the direction which\r\nthe other boats had taken.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing you can row,\" said Mrs. Lecks, settling herself\r\ncomfortably in the stern-sheets, \"for what Mrs. Aleshine and me would\r\nha' done with them oars I am sure I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd never have got into this boat,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"if Mr. Craig\r\nhadn't been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" replied her friend. \"You'd ha' gone to the bottom, hangin'\r\nfor dear life to them ropes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had rounded the bow of the steamer, which appeared to me to be\r\nrapidly settling in the water, I perceived at no great distance several\r\nlights, which of course belonged to the other boats, and I rowed as hard\r\nas I could, hoping to catch up with them, or at least to keep\r\nsufficiently near. It might be my duty to take off some of the people\r\nwho had crowded into the other boats, probably supposing that this one\r\nhad been loaded and gone. How such a mistake could have taken place I\r\ncould not divine, and it was not my business to do so. Quite certain\r\nthat no one was left on the sinking steamer, all I had to do was to row\r\nafter the other boats, and to overtake them as soon as possible. I\r\nthought it would not take me very long to do this, but after rowing for\r\nhalf an hour, Mrs. Aleshine remarked that the lights seemed as far off,\r\nif not farther, than when we first started after them. Turning, I saw\r\nthat this was the case, and was greatly surprised. With only two\r\npassengers I ought soon to have come up with those heavily laden boats.\r\nBut after I had thought over it a little, I considered that as each of\r\nthem was probably pulled by half a dozen stout sailors, it was not so\r\nvery strange that they should make as good or better headway than I did.\r\n\r\nIt was not very long after this that Mrs. Lecks said that she thought\r\nthat the lights on the other boats must be going out, and that this,\r\nmost probably, was due to the fact that the sailors had forgotten to\r\nfill their lanterns before they started. \"That sort of thing often\r\nhappens,\" she said, \"when people leave a place in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I turned around, and peered over the dark waters, it was quite\r\nplain to me that it was not want of oil, but increased distance, which\r\nmade those lights so dim. I could now perceive but three of them, and as\r\nthe surface was agitated only by a gentle swell, I could not suppose\r\nthat any of them were hidden from our view by waves. We were being left\r\nbehind, that was certain, and all I could do was to row on as long and\r\nas well as I could in the direction which the other boats had taken. I\r\nhad been used to rowing, and thought I pulled a good oar, and I\r\ncertainly did not expect to be left behind in this way.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe this boat has been emptied out since the last rain,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Aleshine, \"for my feet are wet, though I didn't notice it\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nAt this I shipped my oars, and began to examine the boat. The bottom was\r\ncovered with a movable floor of slats, and as I put my hand down I could\r\nfeel the water welling up between the slats. The flooring was in\r\nsections, and lifting the one beneath me, I felt under it, and put my\r\nhand into six or eight inches of water.\r\n\r\nThe exact state of the case was now as plain to me as if it had been\r\nposted up on a bulletin-board. This boat had been found to be\r\nunseaworthy, and its use had been forbidden, all the people having been\r\ncrowded into the others. This had caused confusion at the last moment,\r\nand, of course, we were supposed to be on some one of the other boats.\r\n\r\nAnd now here was I, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in a leaky boat,\r\nwith two middle-aged women!\r\n\r\n\"Anythin' the matter with the floor!\" asked Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\nI let the section fall back into its place, and looked aft. By the\r\nstarlight I could see that my two companions had each fixed upon me a\r\nsteadfast gaze. They evidently felt that something was the matter, and\r\nwanted to know what it was. I did not hesitate for a moment to inform\r\nthem. They appeared to me to be women whom it would be neither advisable\r\nnor possible to deceive in a case like this.\r\n\r\n\"This boat has a leak in it,\" I said. \"There is a lot of water in her\r\nalready, and that is the reason we have got along so slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is why,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"it was left empty. We ought to\r\nhave known better than to expect to have a whole boat just for three of\r\nus. It would have been much more sensible, I think, if we had tried to\r\nsqueeze into one of the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"don't you begin findin'\r\nfault with good fortune, when it comes to you. Here we've got a\r\ncomfortable boat, with room enough to set easy and stretch out if we\r\nwant to. If the water is comin' in, what we've got to do is to get it\r\nout again just as fast as we can. What's the best way to do that, Mr.\r\nCraig?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WE WILL PULL AFTER THEM.'\"]\r\n\r\n\"We must bail her out, and lose no time about it,\" said I. \"If I can\r\nfind the leak I may be able to stop it.\"\r\n\r\nI now looked about for something to bail with, and the two women aided\r\nactively in the search. I found one leather scoop in the bow; but as it\r\nwas well that we should all go to work, I took two tin cans that had\r\nbeen put in by some one who had begun to provision the boat, and\r\nproceeded to cut the tops from them with my jack-knife.\r\n\r\n\"Don't lose what's in 'em,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"that is, if it's anythin'\r\nwe'd be likely to want to eat. If it's tomatoes, pour it into the sea,\r\nfor nobody ought to eat tomatoes put up in tins.\"\r\n\r\nI hastily passed the cans to Mrs. Lecks, and I saw her empty the\r\ncontents of one into the sea, and those of the other on a newspaper\r\nwhich she took from her pocket and placed in the stern.\r\n\r\nI pulled up the movable floor and threw it overboard, and then began to\r\nbail.\r\n\r\n\"I thought,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that they always had pumps for leaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"just gether yourself up on\r\none of them seats, and go to work. The less talkin' we do, and the more\r\nscoopin', the better it'll be for us.\"\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that it would have been difficult to find two more\r\nvaluable assistants in the bailing of a boat than Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.\r\nAleshine. They were evidently used to work, and were able to accommodate\r\nthemselves to the unusual circumstances in which they were placed. We\r\nthrew out the water very rapidly, and every little while I stopped\r\nbailing and felt about to see if I could discover where it came in. As\r\nthese attempts met with no success, I gave them up after a time, and set\r\nabout bailing with new vigor, believing that if we could get the boat\r\nnearly dry I should surely be able to find the leak.\r\n\r\nBut, after working half an hour more, I found that the job would be a\r\nlong one; and if we all worked at once we would all be tired out at\r\nonce, and that might be disastrous. Therefore I proposed that we should\r\ntake turns in resting, and Mrs. Aleshine was ordered to stop work for a\r\ntime. After this Mrs. Lecks took a rest, and when she went to work I\r\nstopped bailing and began again to search for the leak.\r\n\r\nFor about two hours we worked in this way, and then I concluded it was\r\nuseless to continue any longer this vain exertion. With three of us\r\nbailing we were able to keep the water at the level we first found it;\r\nbut with only two at work, it slightly gained upon us, so that now there\r\nwas more water in the boat than when we first discovered it. The boat\r\nwas an iron one, and the leak in it I could neither find nor remedy. It\r\nhad probably been caused by the warping of the metal under a hot sun, an\r\naccident which, I am told, frequently occurs to iron boats. The little\r\ncraft, which would have been a life-boat had its air-boxes remained\r\nintact, was now probably leaking from stem to stern; and in searching\r\nfor the leak without the protection of the flooring, my weight had\r\ndoubtless assisted in opening the seams, for it was quite plain that the\r\nwater was now coming in more rapidly than it did at first. We were very\r\ntired, and even Mrs. Lecks, who had all along counseled us to keep at\r\nwork, and not to waste one breath in talking, now admitted that it was\r\nof no use to try to get the water out of that boat.\r\n\r\nIt had been some hours since I had used the oars, but whether we had\r\ndrifted, or remained where we were when I stopped rowing, of course I\r\ncould not know; but this mattered very little; our boat was slowly\r\nsinking beneath us, and it could make no difference whether we went down\r\nin one spot or an other. I sat and racked my brain to think what could\r\nbe done in this fearful emergency. To bail any longer was useless labor,\r\nand what else was there that we could do?\r\n\r\n\"When will it be time,\" asked Mrs. Lecks, \"for us to put on the\r\nlife-preservers? When the water gets nearly to the seats?\"\r\n\r\nI answered that we should not wait any longer than that, but in my own\r\nmind I could not see any advantage in putting them on at all. Why should\r\nwe wish to lengthen our lives by a few hours of helpless floating upon\r\nthe ocean?\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"I'll keep a watch on the water. One of\r\nthem cans was filled with lobster, which would be more than likely to\r\ndisagree with us, and I've throwed it out; but the other had baked beans\r\nin it, and the best thing we can do is to eat some of these right away.\r\nThey are mighty nourishin', and will keep up strength as well as\r\nanythin', and then, as you said there's a keg of water in the boat, we\r\ncan all take a drink of that, and it'll make us feel like new cre'tur's.\r\nYou'll have to take the beans in your hands, for we've got no spoons nor\r\nforks.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine were each curled up out of reach of the\r\nwater, the first in the stern, and the other on the aft thwart. The day\r\nwas now beginning to break, and we could see about us very distinctly.\r\nBefore reaching out her hands to receive her beans, Mrs. Aleshine washed\r\nthem in the water in the boat, remarking at the same time that she might\r\nas well make use of it since it was there. Having then wiped her hands\r\non some part of her apparel, they were filled with beans from the\r\nnewspaper held by Mrs. Lecks, and these were passed over to me. I was\r\nvery hungry, and when I had finished my beans I agreed with my\r\ncompanions that although they would have been a great deal better if\r\nheated up with butter, pepper, and salt, they were very comforting as\r\nthey were. One of the empty cans was now passed to me, and after having\r\nbeen asked by Mrs. Lecks to rinse it out very carefully, we all\r\nsatisfied our taste from the water in the keg.\r\n\r\n\"Cold baked beans and lukewarm water ain't exactly company vittles,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Aleshine, \"but there's many a poor wretch would be glad to get\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nI could not imagine any poor wretch who would be glad of the food\r\ntogether with the attending circumstances; but I did not say so.\r\n\r\n\"The water is just one finger from the bottom of the seat,\" said Mrs.\r\nLecks, who had been stooping over to measure, \"and it's time to put on\r\nthe life-preservers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"hand me mine.\"\r\n\r\nEach of us now buckled on a life-preserver, and as I did so I stood up\r\nupon a thwart and looked about me. It was quite light now, and I could\r\nsee for a long distance over the surface of the ocean, which was gently\r\nrolling in wide, smooth swells. As we rose upon the summit of one of\r\nthese I saw a dark spot upon the water, just on the edge of our near\r\nhorizon, \"Is that the steamer?\" I thought; \"and has she not yet sunk?\"\r\n\r\nAt this there came to me a glimmering of courageous hope. If the\r\nsteamer had remained afloat so long, it was probable that on account of\r\nwater-tight compartments, or for some other reason, her sinking had\r\nreached its limit, and that if we could get back to her we might be\r\nsaved. But, alas, how were we to get back to her? This boat would sink\r\nlong, long before I could row that distance.\r\n\r\nHowever, I soon proclaimed the news to my companions, whereupon Mrs.\r\nAleshine prepared to stand upon a thwart and see for herself. But Mrs.\r\nLecks restrained her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make things worse, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said she, \"by tumblin'\r\noverboard. If we've got to go into the water, let us do it decently and\r\nin order. If that's the ship, Mr. Craig, don't you suppose we can float\r\nourselves to it in some way?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that by the help of a life-preserver a person who could swim\r\nmight reach the ship.\r\n\r\n\"But neither of us can swim,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"for we've lived where\r\nthe water was never more'n a foot deep, except in time of freshets,\r\nwhen there's no swimmin' for man or beast. But if we see you swim,\r\nperhaps we can follow, after a fashion. At any rate, we must do the best\r\nwe can, and that's all there is to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The water now,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, \"is so near to the bottom of my\r\nseat that I've got to stand up, tumble overboard or no.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" remarked Mrs. Lecks; \"we'd better all stand up, and let the\r\nboat sink under us. That will save our jumpin' overboard, or rollin' out\r\nany which way, which might be awkward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine. \"You set the oysters\r\ncreepin' over me again! First you talk of the ship sinkin' under us, and\r\nnow it's the boat goin' to the bottom under our feet. Before any sinkin'\r\n's to be done I'd ruther get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"stand up straight, and don't\r\ntalk so much. It'll be a great deal better to be let down gradual than\r\nto flop into the water all of a bunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"it may be best to get used to it by\r\ndegrees; but I must say I wish I was home.\"\r\n\r\nAs for me, I would have much preferred to jump overboard at once,\r\ninstead of waiting in this cold-blooded manner; but as my companions had\r\nso far preserved their presence of mind, I did not wish to do anything\r\nwhich might throw them into a panic. I believed there would be no danger\r\nfrom the suction caused by the sinking of a small boat like this, and if\r\nwe took care not to entangle ourselves with it in any way, we might as\r\nwell follow Mrs. Lecks's advice as not. So we all stood up, Mrs. Lecks\r\nin the stern, I in the bow, and Mrs. Aleshine on a thwart between us.\r\nThe last did not appear to have quite room enough for a steady footing,\r\nbut, as she remarked, it did not matter very much, as the footing, broad\r\nor narrow, would not be there very long.\r\n\r\nI am used to swimming, and have never hesitated to take a plunge into\r\nriver or ocean, but I must admit that it was very trying to my nerves to\r\nstand up this way and wait for a boat to sink beneath me. How the two\r\nwomen were affected I do not know. They said nothing, but their faces\r\nindicated that something disagreeable was about to happen, and that the\r\nless that was said about it the better.\r\n\r\nThe boat had now sunk so much that the water was around Mrs. Aleshine's\r\nfeet, her standing-place being rather lower than ours. I made myself\r\ncertain that there were no ropes nor any other means of entanglement\r\nnear my companions or myself, and then I waited. There seemed to be a\r\ngood deal of buoyancy in the bow and stern of the boat, and it was a\r\nfrightfully long time in sinking. The suspense became so utterly\r\nunendurable that I was tempted to put one foot on the edge of the boat,\r\nand, by tipping it, put an end to this nerve-rack; but I refrained, for\r\nI probably would throw the women off their balance, when they might fall\r\nagainst some part of the boat, and do themselves a hurt. I had just\r\nrelinquished this intention, when two little waves seemed to rise one on\r\neach side of Mrs. Aleshine, and gently flowing over the side of the\r\nboat, they flooded her feet with water.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your breaths!\" I shouted. And now I experienced a sensation which\r\nmust have been very like that which comes to a condemned criminal at the\r\nfirst indication of the pulling of the drop. Then there was a horrible\r\nsinking, a gurgle, and a swash, and the ocean over which I had been\r\ngazing appeared to rise up and envelop me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'STAND UP STRAIGHT, AND DON'T TALK SO MUCH.'\"]\r\n\r\nIn a moment, however, my head was out of the water, and, looking hastily\r\nabout me, I saw, close by, the heads and shoulders of Mrs. Lecks and\r\nMrs. Aleshine. The latter was vigorously winking her eyes and blowing\r\nfrom her mouth some sea-water that had got into it; but as soon as her\r\neyes fell upon me she exclaimed: \"That was ever so much more suddint\r\nthan I thought it was goin' to be!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"VIGOROUSLY WINKING AND BLOWING.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Are you both all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I am,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"but I never thought that a person\r\nwith a life-preserver on would go clean under the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But since you've come up again, you ought to be satisfied,\" said Mrs.\r\nLecks. \"And now,\" she added, turning her face toward me, \"which way\r\nought we to try to swim? and have we got everythin' we want to take with\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n\"What we haven't got we can't get,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine; \"and as for\r\nswimmin', I expect I'm goin' to make a poor hand at it.\"\r\n\r\nI had a hope, which was not quite strong enough to be a belief, that,\r\nsupported by their life-preservers, the two women might paddle\r\nthemselves along; and that, by giving them in turn a helping hand, I\r\nmight eventually get them to the steamer. There was a strong probability\r\nthat I would not succeed, but I did not care to think of that.\r\n\r\nI now swam in front of my companions, and endeavored to instruct them in\r\nthe best method of propelling themselves with their arms and their\r\nhands. If they succeeded in this, I thought I would give them some\r\nfurther lessons in striking out with their feet. After watching me\r\nattentively, Mrs. Lecks did manage to move herself slowly through the\r\nsmooth water, but poor Mrs. Aleshine could do nothing but splash.\r\n\r\n\"If there was anythin' to take hold of,\" she said to me, \"I might get\r\nalong; but I can't get any grip on the water, though you seem to do it\r\nwell enough. Look there!\" she added in a higher voice. \"Isn't that an\r\noar floatin' over there? If you can get that for me, I believe I can row\r\nmyself much better than I can swim.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed an odd idea, but I swam over to the floating oar, and\r\nbrought it her. I was about to show her how she could best use it, but\r\nshe declined my advice.\r\n\r\n\"If I do it at all,\" she said, \"I must do it in my own way.\" And taking\r\nthe oar in her strong hands, she began to ply it on the water very much\r\nin the way in which she would handle a broom. At first she dipped the\r\nblade too deeply, but, correcting this error, she soon began to paddle\r\nherself along at a slow but steady rate.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" I cried. \"You do that admirably!\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody who's swept as many rooms as I have,\" she said, \"ought to be\r\nable to handle anythin' that can be used like a broom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there another oar?\" cried Mrs. Lecks, who had now been left a\r\nlittle distance behind us. \"If there is, I want one.\"\r\n\r\nLooking about me, I soon discovered another floating oar, and brought it\r\nto Mrs. Lecks, who, after holding it in various positions, so as to get\r\n\"the hang of it,\" as she said, soon began to use it with as much skill\r\nas that shown by her friend. If either of them had been obliged to use\r\nan oar in the ordinary way, I fear they would have had a bad time of it;\r\nbut, considering the implement in the light of a broom, its use\r\nimmediately became familiar to them, and they got on remarkably well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEY GOT ON REMARKABLY WELL.\"]\r\n\r\nI now took a position a little in advance of my companions, and as I\r\nswam slowly they were easily able to keep up with me. Mrs. Aleshine,\r\nbeing so stout, floated much higher out of the water than either Mrs.\r\nLecks or I, and this permitted her to use her oar with a great deal of\r\nfreedom. Sometimes she would give such a vigorous brush to the water\r\nthat she would turn herself almost entirely around, but after a little\r\npractice she learned to avoid undue efforts of this kind.\r\n\r\nI was not positively sure that we were going in the right direction, for\r\nmy position did not allow me to see very far over the water; but I\r\nremembered that when I was standing up in the boat, and made my\r\ndiscovery, the sun was just about to rise in front of me, while the dark\r\nspot on the ocean lay to my left. Judging, therefore, from the present\r\nposition of the sun, which was not very high, I concluded that we were\r\nmoving toward the north, and therefore in the right direction. How far\r\noff the steamer might be I had no idea, for I was not accustomed to\r\njudging distances at sea; but I believed that if we were careful of our\r\nstrength, and if the ocean continued as smooth as it now was, we might\r\neventually reach the vessel, provided she were yet afloat.\r\n\r\n\"After you are fairly in the water,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, as she swept\r\nalong, although without the velocity which that phrase usually implies,\r\n\"it isn't half so bad as I thought it would be. For one thing, it don't\r\nfeel a bit salt, although I must say it tasted horribly that way when I\r\nfirst went into it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't expect to find pickle-brine, did you?\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\"Though, if it was, I suppose we could float on it settin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as to bein' cold,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"the part of me that's in is\r\nactually more comfortable than that which is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing I would have been afraid of,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"if we\r\nhadn't made preparations for it, and that's sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preparations!\" I exclaimed. \"How in the world did you prepare for\r\nsharks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy enough,\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"When we went down into our room to get\r\nready to go away in the boats we both put on black stockin's. I've read\r\nthat sharks never bite colored people, although if they see a white man\r\nin the water they'll snap him up as quick as lightnin'; and black\r\nstockin's was the nearest we could come to it. You see, I thought as\r\nlike as not we'd have some sort of an upset before we got through.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a great comfort,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, \"and I'm very glad you\r\nthought of it, Mrs. Lecks. After this I shall make it a rule: Black\r\nstockin's for sharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose in your case,\" said Mrs. Lecks, addressing me, \"dark trousers\r\nwill do as well.\"\r\n\r\nTo which I answered that I sincerely hoped they would.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing I'm thankful for,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"is that I thought\r\nto put on a flannel skeert.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's the good of it,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"when it's soppin' wet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flannel's flannel,\" replied her friend, \"whether it's wet or dry; and\r\nif you'd had the rheumatism as much as I have, you'd know it.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Mrs. Lecks replied with a sniff, and asked me how soon I thought\r\nwe would get sight of the ship; for if we were going the wrong way, and\r\nhad to turn round and go back, it would certainly be very provoking.\r\n\r\nI should have been happy indeed to be able to give a satisfactory answer\r\nto this question. Every time that we rose upon a swell I threw a rapid\r\nglance around the whole circle of the horizon; and at last, not a\r\nquarter of an hour after Mrs. Lecks's question, I was rejoiced to see,\r\nalmost in the direction in which I supposed it ought to be, the dark\r\nspot which I had before discovered. I shouted the glad news, and as we\r\nrose again my companions strained their eyes in the direction to which I\r\npointed. They both saw it, and were greatly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"it seems as if there was somethin' to\r\nwork for\"; and she began to sweep her oar with great vigor.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to tire yourself out before you get there, Barb'ry\r\nAleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"you'd better go on in that way. Now what I\r\nadvise is that we stop rowin' altogether, and have somethin' to eat; for\r\nI'm sure we need it to keep up our strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat!\" I cried. \"What are you going to eat? Do you expect to catch\r\nfish?\"\r\n\r\n\"And eat 'em raw?\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"I should think not. But do you\r\nsuppose, Mr. Craig, that Mrs. Aleshine and me would go off and leave\r\nthat ship without takin' somethin' to eat by the way? Let's all gether\r\nhere in a bunch, and see what sort of a meal we can make. And now,\r\nBarb'ry Aleshine, if you lay your oar down there on the water, I\r\nrecommend you to tie it to one of your bonnet-strings, or it'll be\r\nfloatin' away, and you won't get it again.\"\r\n\r\nAs she said this, Mrs. Lecks put her right hand down into the water, and\r\nfumbled about, apparently in search of a pocket. I could not but smile\r\nas I thought of the condition of food when, for an hour or more, it had\r\nbeen a couple of feet under the surface of the ocean; but my ideas on\r\nthe subject were entirely changed when I saw Mrs. Lecks hold up in the\r\nair two German sausages, and shake the briny drops from their smooth and\r\nglittering surfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THERE'S NOTHIN' LIKE SAUSAGES FOR SHIPWRECK.'\"]\r\n\r\n\"There's nothin',\" she said, \"like sausages for shipwreck and that kind\r\no' thing. They're very sustainin', and bein' covered with a tight skin,\r\nwater can't get at 'em, no matter how you carry 'em. I wouldn't bring\r\nthese out in the boat, because, havin' the beans, we might as well eat\r\nthem. Have you a knife about you, Mr. Craig?\"\r\n\r\nI produced a dripping jack-knife, and after the open blade had been\r\nwaved in the air to dry it a little, Mrs. Lecks proceeded to divide one\r\nof the sausages, handing the other to me to hold meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't go eatin' sausages without bread, if you don't want 'em to\r\ngive you dyspepsy,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, who was tugging at a submarine\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very much afraid your bread is all soaked,\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\nTo which her friend replied that that remained to be seen, and forthwith\r\nproduced, with a splash, a glass preserve-jar with a metal top.\r\n\r\n\"I saw this nearly empty, as I looked into the ship's pantry, and I\r\nstuffed into it all the soft biscuits it would hold. There was some sort\r\nof jam left at the bottom, so that the one who gets the last biscuit\r\nwill have somethin' of a little spread on it. And now, Mrs. Lecks,\" she\r\ncontinued triumphantly, as she unscrewed the top, \"that rubber ring has\r\nkept 'em as dry as chips. I'm mighty glad of it, for I had trouble\r\nenough gettin' this jar into my pocket, and gettin' it out, too, for\r\nthat matter.\"\r\n\r\nFloating thus, with our hands and shoulders above the water, we made a\r\nvery good meal from the sausages and soft biscuit.\r\n\r\n\"Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, as her friend proceeded to cut the\r\nsecond sausage, \"don't you lay that knife down, when you've done with\r\nit, as if 't was an oar; for if you do it'll sink, as like as not, about\r\nsix miles. I've read that the ocean is as deep as that in some places.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, \"I hope we are not over\r\none of them deep spots.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no knowin',\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"but if it's more comfortin' to\r\nthink it's shallerer, we'll make up our minds that way. Now, then,\" she\r\ncontinued, \"we'll finish off this meal with a little somethin' to drink.\r\nI'm not given to takin' spirits, but I never travel without a little\r\nwhisky, ready mixed with water, to take if it should be needed.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she produced from one of her pockets a whisky-flask tightly\r\ncorked, and of its contents we each took a sip, Mrs. Aleshine remarking\r\nthat, leaving out being chilled or colicky, we were never likely to need\r\nit more than now.\r\n\r\nThus refreshed and strengthened, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine took up\r\ntheir oars, while I swam slightly in advance, as before. When, with\r\noccasional intermissions of rest, and a good deal of desultory\r\nconversation, we had swept and swam for about an hour, Mrs. Lecks\r\nsuddenly exclaimed: \"I can see that thing ever so much plainer now, and\r\nI don't believe it's a ship at all. To me it looks like bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're mighty long-sighted without your specs,\" said Mrs. Aleshine,\r\n\"and I'm not sure but what you're right.\"\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes or more I had been puzzling over the shape of the dark\r\nspot, which was now nearly all the time in sight. Its peculiar form had\r\nfilled me with a dreadful fear that it was the steamer, bottom upward,\r\nalthough I knew enough about nautical matters to have no good reason to\r\nsuppose that this could be the case. I am not far-sighted, but when Mrs.\r\nLecks suggested bushes, I gazed at the distant object with totally\r\ndifferent ideas, and soon began to believe that it was not a ship,\r\neither right side up or wrong side up, but that it might be an island.\r\nThis belief I proclaimed to my companions, and for some time we all\r\nworked with increased energy in the desire to get near enough to make\r\nourselves certain in regard to this point.\r\n\r\n\"As true as I'm standin' here,\" said Mrs. Lecks, who, although she could\r\nnot read without spectacles, had remarkably good sight at long range,\r\n\"them is trees and bushes that I see before me, though they do seem to\r\nbe growin' right out of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's an island under them; you may be sure of that!\" I cried. \"Isn't\r\nthis ever so much better than a sinking ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"I'm used to the ship,\r\nand as long as it didn't sink I'd prefer it. There's plenty to eat on\r\nboard of it, and good beds to sleep on, which is more than can be\r\nexpected on a little bushy place like that ahead of us. But then, the\r\nship might sink all of a suddint, beds, vittles, and all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that is the island the other boats went to?\" asked Mrs.\r\nLecks.\r\n\r\nThis question I had already asked of myself. I had been told that the\r\nisland to which the captain intended to take his boats lay about thirty\r\nmiles south of the point where we left the steamer. Now I knew very\r\nwell that we had not come thirty miles, and had reason to believe,\r\nmoreover, that the greater part of the progress we had made had been\r\ntoward the north. It was not at all probable that the position of this\r\nisland was unknown to our captain; and it must, therefore, have been\r\nconsidered by him as an unsuitable place for the landing of his\r\npassengers. There might be many reasons for this unsuitableness: the\r\nisland might be totally barren and desolate; it might be the abode of\r\nunpleasant natives; and, more important than anything else, it was, in\r\nall probability, a spot where steamers never touched.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever its disadvantages, I was most wildly desirous to reach it;\r\nmore so, I believe, than either of my companions. I do not mean that\r\nthey were not sensible of their danger, and desirous to be freed from\r\nit; but they were women who had probably had a rough time of it during a\r\ngreat part of their lives, and on emerging from their little circle of\r\nrural experiences, accepted with equanimity, and almost as a matter of\r\ncourse, the rough times which come to people in the great outside world.\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe,\" I said, in answer to Mrs. Lecks, \"that that is the\r\nisland to which the captain would have taken us; but, whatever it is, it\r\nis dry land, and we must get there as soon as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for I'd like to have ground nearer\r\nto my feet than six miles; and if we don't find anything to eat and any\r\nplace to sleep when we get there, it's no more than can be said of the\r\nplace where we are now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're too particular, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"about your\r\ncomforts. If you find the ground too hard to sleep on, when you get\r\nthere, you can put on your life-preserver, and go to bed in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"and if these islands are made of\r\ncoral, as I've heard they are, and if they're as full of small p'ints as\r\nsome coral I've got at home, you'll be glad to take a berth by me, Mrs.\r\nLecks.\"\r\n\r\nI counseled my companions to follow me as rapidly as possible, and we\r\nall pushed vigorously forward. When we had approached near enough to the\r\nisland to see what sort of place it really was, we perceived that it was\r\na low-lying spot, apparently covered with verdure, and surrounded, as\r\nfar as we could see as we rose on the swells, by a rocky reef, against\r\nwhich a tolerably high surf was running.\r\n\r\nI knew enough of the formation of these coral islands to suppose that\r\nwithin this reef was a lagoon of smooth water, into which there were\r\nopenings through the rocky barrier. It was necessary to try to find one\r\nof these, for it would be difficult and perhaps dangerous to attempt to\r\nland through the surf.\r\n\r\nBefore us we could see a continuous line of white-capped breakers, and\r\nso I led my little party to the right, hoping that we would soon see\r\nsigns of an opening in the reef.\r\n\r\nWe swam and paddled, however, for a long time, and still the surf rolled\r\nmenacingly on the rocks before us. We were now as close to the island as\r\nwe could approach with safety, and I determined to circumnavigate it,\r\nif necessary, before I would attempt, with these two women, to land upon\r\nthat jagged reef. At last we perceived, at no great distance before us,\r\na spot where there seemed to be no breakers; and when we reached it we\r\nfound, to our unutterable delight, that here was smooth water flowing\r\nthrough a wide opening in the reef. The rocks were piled up quite high,\r\nand the reef, at this point at least, was a wide one, but as we neared\r\nthe opening we found that it narrowed very soon, and made a turn to the\r\nleft, so that from the outside we could not see into the lagoon.\r\n\r\nI swam into this smooth water, followed closely by Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.\r\nAleshine, who, however, soon became unable to use their oars, owing to\r\nthe proximity of the rocks. Dropping these useful implements, they\r\nmanaged to paddle after me with their hands, and they were as much\r\nastonished as I was when, just after making the slight turn, we found\r\nstretched across the narrow passage a great iron bar about eight or ten\r\ninches above the water. A little farther on, and two or three feet above\r\nthe water, another iron bar extended from one rocky wall to the other.\r\nWithout uttering a word I examined the lower bar, and found one end of\r\nit fastened by means of a huge padlock to a great staple driven into the\r\nrock. The lock was securely wrapped in what appeared to be tarred\r\ncanvas. A staple through an eyehole in the bar secured the other end of\r\nit to the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"These bars were put here,\" I exclaimed, \"to keep out boats, whether at\r\nhigh or low water. You see they can only be thrown out of the way by\r\ntaking off the padlocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't keep us out,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"for we can duck under. I\r\nsuppose whoever put 'em here didn't expect anybody to arrive on\r\nlife-preservers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\nAdopting Mrs. Lecks's suggestion, I \"ducked\" my head under the bar, and\r\npassed to the other side of it. Mrs. Lecks, with but little trouble,\r\nfollowed my example; but Mrs. Aleshine, who, by reason of her stoutness,\r\nfloated so much higher out of the water than her friend and I, found it\r\nimpossible to get herself under the bar. In whatever manner she made the\r\nattempt, her head or her shoulders were sure to bump and arrest her\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, who had been watching her, \"if\r\nyou ever want to get out of this salt water, you've got to make up your\r\nmind to take some of it into your mouth and into your eyes, that is, if\r\nyou don't keep 'em shut. Get yourself as close to that bar as you can,\r\nand I'll come and put you under.\" So saying, Mrs. Lecks returned to the\r\nother side of the bar, and having made Mrs. Aleshine bow down her head\r\nand close her eyes and mouth, she placed both hands upon her companion's\r\nbroad shoulders, and threw as much weight as possible upon them. Mrs.\r\nAleshine almost disappeared beneath the water, but she came up\r\nsputtering and blinking on the other side of the bar, where she was\r\nquickly joined by Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, wiping her wet face with her\r\nstill wetter sleeve, \"I never supposed the heathens would be up to such\r\ntricks as makin' us do that!\"\r\n\r\nI had waited to give any assistance that might be required, and, while\r\ndoing so, had discovered another bar under the water, which proved that\r\nentrance at almost any stage of the tide had been guarded against.\r\nWarning my companions not to strike their feet against this submerged\r\nbar, we paddled and pushed ourselves around the turn in the rocky\r\npassage, and emerged into the open lagoon.\r\n\r\nThis smooth stretch of water, which separated the island from its\r\nencircling reef, was here about a hundred feet wide; and the first thing\r\nthat arrested our attention as we gazed across it was a little wharf or\r\nlanding-stage, erected upon the narrow beach of the island, almost\r\nopposite to us.\r\n\r\n\"As sure as I stand here,\" exclaimed Mrs. Lecks, who never seemed to\r\nforget her upright position, \"somebody lives in this place!\"\r\n\r\n\"And it isn't a stickery coral island, either,\" cried Mrs. Aleshine,\r\n\"for that sand's as smooth as any I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever does live here,\" resumed Mrs. Lecks, \"has got to take us in,\r\nwhether they like it or not, and the sooner we get over there, the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Aleshine now regretted the loss of her oar, and suggested that some\r\none of us who could get under bars easily should go back after it. But\r\nMrs. Lecks would listen to no such proposition.\r\n\r\n\"Let the oars go,\" she said. \"We won't want 'em again, for I'll never\r\nleave this place if I have to scoop myself out to sea with an oar.\"\r\n\r\nI told the two women that I could easily tow them across this narrow\r\npiece of water; and instructing Mrs. Lecks to take hold of the tail of\r\nmy coat, while Mrs. Aleshine grasped her companion's dress, I began to\r\nswim slowly toward the beach, towing my companions behind me.\r\n\r\n\"Goodnessful gracious me!\" suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, with a\r\ngreat bounce and a splash, \"look at the fishes!\"\r\n\r\nThe water in the lagoon was so clear that it was almost transparent, and\r\nbeneath us and around us we could see fish, some large and some small,\r\nswimming about as if they were floating in the air, while down below the\r\nwhite sandy bottom seemed to sparkle in the sunlight.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't jerk my skeert off on account of the fishes,\" said Mrs.\r\nLecks. \"I expect there was just as many outside, though we couldn't see\r\n'em. But I must say that this water looks as if it had been boiled and\r\nfiltered.\"\r\n\r\nIf any inhabitant of the island had then been standing on the wharf, he\r\nwould have beheld on the surface of the lagoon the peculiar spectacle of\r\na man's head surmounted by a wet and misshapen straw hat, and followed\r\nby two other heads, each wearing a dripping and bedraggled bonnet, while\r\nbeneath, among the ripples of the clear water, would have been seen the\r\nfigures belonging to these three heads, each dressed in the clothes\r\nordinarily worn on land.\r\n\r\nAs I swam I could see before me, on the island, nothing but a mass of\r\nlow-growing, tropical vegetation, behind which rose some palms and other\r\ntrees. I made for the little wharf, from which steps came down into the\r\nwater, and as soon as we reached it we all clambered rapidly up, and\r\nstood dripping upon the narrow platform, stamping our feet and shaking\r\nour clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that house?\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"That's where they live, and I\r\nwonder which way we must go to get there.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this somewhat elevated position I could plainly see, over the tops\r\nof the bushes and low trees, the upper part of the roof of a house. When\r\nI found the bars across the passage in the reef, I had easily come to\r\nthe conclusion that the inhabitants of this island were not savages; and\r\nnow since I had seen the wharf and the roof of this house, I felt quite\r\nconvinced that we had reached the abode of civilized beings. They might\r\nbe pirates or some other sort of sea miscreants, but they were certainly\r\nnot savages or cannibals.\r\n\r\nLeaving the wharf, we soon found a broad path through the bushes, and\r\nin a few moments reached a wide, open space, in which stood a handsome\r\nmodern-built house. It was constructed after the fashion of tropical\r\nhouses belonging to Europeans, with jalousied porches and shaded\r\nbalconies; the grounds about it were neatly laid out, and behind it was\r\na walled inclosure, probably a garden.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, \"I'd like to be less drippin'\r\nbefore I make a call on genteel folks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Genteel folks!\" exclaimed Mrs. Lecks, indignantly. \"If you're too proud\r\nto go in as you are, Barb'ry Aleshine, you can go set in the sun till\r\nyou're dry. As for me, I'm goin' to ask for the lady of the house, and\r\nif she don't like me she can lump me, so long as she gives me somethin'\r\nto eat and a dry bed to get into.\"\r\n\r\nI was too much amazed to speak, but my companions took everything as a\r\nmatter of course. They had expected to see strange things in the outer\r\nworld, and they were not surprised when they saw them. My mind was not\r\ncapable of understanding the existence of an establishment like this on\r\na little island in mid-ocean. But it was useless for me to attempt to\r\nreason on this apparent phenomenon; and, indeed, there was no time for\r\nit, for Mrs. Lecks walked boldly up to the front door and plied the\r\nknocker, stepping back immediately, so that she might not drip too much\r\nwater on the porch.\r\n\r\n\"When they come,\" she said, \"we'll ask 'em to let us in the back way, so\r\nthat we sha'n't slop up their floors any more than we can help.\"\r\n\r\nWe waited for a couple of minutes, and then I, as the member of the\r\nparty who dripped the least, went up on the porch and knocked again.\r\n\r\n\"It's my belief they're not at home,\" said Mrs. Lecks, after we had\r\nwaited some time longer, \"but perhaps we'll find some of the servants\r\nin,\" and she led the way to the back part of the house.\r\n\r\nAs we passed the side of the mansion I noticed that all the\r\nwindow-shutters were closed, and my growing belief that the place was\r\ndeserted became a conviction after we had knocked several times at a\r\ndoor at the back of the building without receiving any answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're all gone out, that's certain!\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and they barred up the entrance to the island when they left,\" I\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if there's another house in the neighborhood?\" asked Mrs.\r\nAleshine.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe,\" said I, \"that the neighborhood is very thickly\r\nsettled; but if you will wait here a few minutes, I will run around this\r\nwall and see what there is beyond. I may find the huts of some natives\r\nor work-people.\"\r\n\r\nI followed a path by the side of the garden wall, but when I reached the\r\nend of the inclosure I could see nothing before me but jungle and\r\nforest, with paths running in several directions. I followed one of\r\nthese, and very soon came out upon an open beach, with the reef lying\r\nbeyond it. From the form of the beach and the reef, and from the\r\nappearance of things generally, I began to think that this was probably\r\na very small island, and that the house we had seen was the only one\r\non it. I returned and reported this belief to my companions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MRS. LECKS WALKED BOLDLY UP TO THE FRONT DOOR AND PLIED\r\nTHE KNOCKER.\"]\r\n\r\nNow that Mrs. Aleshine had no fear of appearing in an untidy condition\r\nbefore \"genteel folks,\" her manner changed very much. \"If the family has\r\ngone into the country,\" said she, \"or whatever else they've done, I want\r\nto get into this house as soon as I can. I expect we can find something\r\nto eat. At any rate, we can get ourselves dry, and lay down somewhere to\r\nrest, for not a wink has one of us slept since night before last.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think,\" said Mrs. Lecks, addressing me, \"that if you could\r\nmanage to climb up to them second-story windows, you might find one of\r\nthem that you could get in, and then come down and open the door for us.\r\nEverybody is likely to forget to fasten some of the windows on the upper\r\nfloors. I know it isn't right to force our way into other people's\r\nhouses, but there's nothin' else to be done, and there's no need of our\r\ntalkin' about it.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed with her perfectly, and taking off my coat and shoes, I climbed\r\nup one of the columns of the veranda, and got upon its roof. This\r\nextended nearly the whole length of two sides of the house. I walked\r\nalong it and tried all the shutters, and I soon came to one in which\r\nsome of the movable slats had been broken. Thrusting my hand and arm\r\nthrough the aperture thus formed, I unhooked the shutters and opened\r\nthem. The sash was fastened down by one of the ordinary contrivances\r\nused for such purposes, but with the blade of my jack-knife I easily\r\npushed the bolt aside, raised the sash, and entered. I found myself in\r\na small hall at the head of a flight of stairs. Down these I hurried,\r\nand, groping my way through the semi-darkness of the lower story, I\r\nreached a side door. This was fastened by two bolts and a bar, and I\r\nquickly had it open.\r\n\r\nStepping outside, I called Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the latter, \"I'm sure I'll be glad to get in, and as we've\r\nsqueezed most of the water out of our clothes, we won't make so much of\r\na mess, after all.\"\r\n\r\nWe now entered, and I opened one of the shutters.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go right into the kitchen,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"and make a fire.\r\nThat's the first thing to do.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE COLUMNS.\"]\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Lecks soon discovered that this mansion was very different from\r\na country dwelling in one of our Middle States. Externally, and as far\r\nas I had been able to observe its internal arrangements, it resembled\r\nthe houses built by English residents which I had seen in the West\r\nIndies. It was a dwelling in which modern ideas in regard to\r\nconstruction and furnishing adapted themselves to the requirements of a\r\ntropical climate. Apparently there was no kitchen. There were no stairs\r\nleading to a lower floor, and the darkened rooms into which my\r\ncompanions peered were certainly not used for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I had gone out of the door by which we had entered, and\r\nsoon discovered, on the other side of the house, a small building with a\r\nchimney to it, which I felt sure must be the kitchen. The door and\r\nshutters were fastened, but before making any attempt to open them I\r\nreturned to announce my discovery.\r\n\r\n\"Door locked, is it?\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"Just wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nShe then disappeared, but in a very short time came out, carrying a\r\nbunch of large keys.\r\n\r\n\"It's always the way,\" said she, as the two followed me round the back\r\nof the house, \"when people shut up a house and leave it, to put all the\r\ndoor-keys in the back corner of some drawer in the hall, and to take\r\nonly the front-door key with them. So, you see, I knew just where to go\r\nfor these.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a poor hen,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"that begins to cackle when she's\r\ngoin' to her nest; the wise ones wait till they're comin' away. Now\r\nwe'll see if one of them keys fit.\"\r\n\r\nGreatly to the triumph of Mrs. Aleshine, the second or third key I tried\r\nunlocked the door. Entering, we found ourselves in a good-sized kitchen,\r\nwith a great fireplace at one end of it. A door opened from the room\r\ninto a shed where there was a pile of dry twigs and fire-wood.\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a fire as quick as we can,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"for since I\r\nwent into that shet-up house I've been chilled to the bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"and now I know how a fish keeps\r\ncomfortable in the water, and how dreadfully wet and flabby it must feel\r\nwhen it's taken out.\"\r\n\r\nI brought in a quantity of wood and kindling, and finding matches in a\r\ntin box on the wall, I went to work to make a fire, and was soon\r\nrewarded by a crackling blaze. Turning around, I was amazed at the\r\nactions of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine. I had expected to see them\r\nstanding shivering behind me, waiting for the fire to be made; but\r\ninstead of that, they were moving rapidly here and there, saying not a\r\nword, but going as straight to cupboard, closet, and pantry as the hound\r\nfollows the track of the hare. From a wild chaos of uncongenial\r\nsurroundings, these two women had dropped into a sphere in which they\r\nwere perfectly at home. The kitchen was not altogether like those to\r\nwhich they had been accustomed, but it was a well-appointed one, and\r\ntheir instincts and practice made them quickly understand where they\r\nwould find what they wanted. I gazed on them with delight while one\r\nfilled a kettle from a little pump in the corner which brought water\r\nfrom a cistern, and the other appeared from the pantry, carrying a\r\ntea-caddy and a tin biscuit-box.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Mrs. Lecks, hanging the kettle on a crane over the\r\nfire, and drawing up a chair, \"by the time we've got a little dried off\r\nthe kettle will bile, and we'll have some hot tea, and then the best\r\nthing to do is to go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll take time to have a bite first,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for I was\r\nnever so near famished in my life. I brought out a box nearly full of\r\nbiscuits, and there's sardines in this, Mr. Craig, which you can easy\r\nopen with your knife.\"\r\n\r\nI piled on more wood, and we gathered close around the genial heat. The\r\nsunshine was hot outside, but that did not prevent the fire from being\r\nmost comforting and refreshing to us.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the kettle began to simmer, up jumped Mrs. Aleshine. A\r\nsugar-bowl and some cups were placed upon a table, and in a short time\r\nwe were cheered and invigorated by hot tea, biscuits, and sardines.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't much of a meal,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, apologetically, \"but\r\nthere's no time to cook nothin', and the sooner we get off our wet\r\nthings and find some beds, the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can once get into bed,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"all I ask is that the\r\nfamily will not come back till I have had a good long nap. After that,\r\nthey can do what they please.\"\r\n\r\nWe now went back to the house, and ascended the main stairway, which led\r\nup to a large central hall.\r\n\r\n\"We won't go into the front rooms,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"for we don't want\r\nto make no more disturbance than we can help; but if we can find the\r\nsmallest kind of rooms in the back, with beds in 'em, it is all we can\r\nask.\"\r\n\r\nThe first chamber we entered was a good-sized one, neatly furnished,\r\ncontaining a bedstead with uncovered mattress and pillows. Opening a\r\ncloset door, Mrs. Lecks exclaimed: \"This is a man's room, Mr. Craig, and\r\nyou'd better take it. Look at the trousers and coats! There's no\r\nbedclothes in here, but I'll see if I can't find some.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she returned, bearing blankets, sheets, and a\r\npillow-case. With Mrs. Aleshine on one side of the bedstead and Mrs.\r\nLecks on the other, the sheets and blankets were laid with surprising\r\ndeftness and rapidity, and in a few moments I saw before me a most\r\ninviting bed.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Aleshine held a pillow in her teeth as she pulled on the\r\npillow-case with both hands, Mrs. Lecks looked around the room with the\r\nair of an attentive hostess. \"I guess you'll be comfortable, Mr. Craig,\"\r\nshe said, \"and I advise you to sleep just as long as you can. We'll take\r\nthe room on the other side of the hall; but I'm first goin' down to see\r\nif the kitchen fire is safe, and to fasten the doors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I GUESS YOU'LL BE COMFORTABLE, MR. CRAIG.'\"]\r\n\r\nI offered to relieve her of this trouble, but she promptly declined my\r\nservices. \"When it's rowin' or swimmin', you can do it, Mr. Craig, but\r\nwhen it's lockin' up and lookin' to fires, I'll attend to that myself.\"\r\n\r\nMy watch had stopped, but I suppose it was the middle of the afternoon\r\nwhen I went to bed, and I slept steadily until some hours after sunrise\r\nthe next morning, when I was awakened by a loud knock at the door.\r\n\r\n\"It's time to get up,\" said the voice of Mrs. Lecks, \"and if your\r\nclothes are not entirely dry, you'd better see if there isn't somethin'\r\nin that closet you can put on. After a while I'll make a big fire in the\r\nkitchen, and dry all our things.\"\r\n\r\nI found my clothes were still very damp, and after investigating the\r\ncontents of the closet and bureau, I was able to supply myself with\r\nlinen and a light summer suit which fitted me fairly well. I even found\r\nsocks and a pair of slippers.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the kitchen, I first opened wide my eyes with delight,\r\nand then I burst out laughing. Before me was a table covered with a\r\nwhite cloth, with plates, cups, and everything necessary upon it; at one\r\nend was a steaming tea-pot, and at the other a dish of some kind of hot\r\nmeat, and Mrs. Aleshine was just taking a pan of newly baked biscuits\r\nfrom a small iron oven.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder you laugh,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"but our clothes was still\r\nwet, and we had to take just what we could find. I'm not in the habit of\r\ngoin' about in a white muslin wrapper with blue-ribbon trimmin's, and as\r\nfor Mrs. Aleshine, I did think we'd never find anything that she could\r\nget into; but there must be one stout woman in the family, for that\r\nyeller frock with black buttons fits her well enough, though I must say\r\nit's a good deal short.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, as she sat down at the tea-pot,\r\n\"that the heathens had so many conveniences, specially bakin'-powders\r\nand Dutch ovens. For my part, I always supposed that they used their\r\naltars for bakin', when they wasn't offerin' up victims on 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got it into your head, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks,\r\nlooking up from the dish of potted beef she was serving, \"that this\r\nhouse belongs to common heathen? I expect that most of the savages who\r\nlive on these desert islands has been converted by the missionaries, but\r\nthey'd have to take 'em from Genesis to Revelations a good many times\r\nbefore they'd get 'em to the p'int of havin' force-pumps in their\r\nkitchens and spring-mattresses on their beds. As far as I've seen this\r\nhouse, it looks as if the family had always been Christians, and\r\nprobably either Catholics or Episcopalians.\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of the cross on the mantelpiece in our room, I suppose,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Aleshine. \"But whether they're given to idols or prayer-books,\r\nI know they've got a mighty nice house; and considerin' the distance\r\nfrom stores, there's a good deal more in that pantry than you'd expect\r\nto find in any house I know of, when the family is away.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion,\" said I, \"that this house belongs to some rich man,\r\nprobably an American or European merchant, who lives on one of the large\r\nislands not far away, and who uses this as a sort of summer residence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was always summer in this part of the world,\" said Mrs.\r\nLecks.\r\n\r\n\"So it is in effect,\" I replied, \"but there are some seasons when it is\r\nvery unpleasant to remain in one of those towns which are found on the\r\nlarger islands, and so the owner of this house may come up here\r\nsometimes for fresh sea air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or it's just as like,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that he lives somewhere up\r\nin the iceberg regions, and comes here to spend his winters. It would do\r\njust as well. But, whichever way it is, I can't help thinkin' it's\r\ncareless not to leave somebody in the house to take care of it. Why, for\r\nall the family would know about it, tramps might break in and stay as\r\nlong as they like.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what's happenin' now,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"and for my part I\r\nain't goin' to find no fault. I don't suppose the people would have been\r\nso hard-hearted as to turn us away from their doors, but I've seen\r\nenough of folks in this world not to be too sure about that.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THAT YELLER FROCK.\"]\r\n\r\n\"How do you suppose,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, addressing me, \"that the\r\nfamily gets here and goes back? Do they keep a private steamboat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they have a private vessel of some kind,\" I answered,\r\n\"probably a yacht. It is quite certain that ordinary steamers never\r\ntouch here.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"all we can do is to wait here\r\ntill they come, and get them to send us away in their ship. But whether\r\nthey've just gone or are just a-comin' back depends, I suppose, on\r\nwhether they live in a freezin' or a burnin' country; and if they don't\r\nlike our bein' here when they come back, there's one thing they can make\r\nup their minds to, and that is that I'm never goin' to leave this place\r\non a life-preserver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor me nuther,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, finishing, with much complacency,\r\nher third cup of tea.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, Mrs. Lecks pushed back her chair, but did not\r\nimmediately rise. With an expression of severe thought upon her face,\r\nshe gazed steadfastly before her for a minute, and then she addressed\r\nMrs. Aleshine, who had begun to gather together the cups and the plates.\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said she, \"don't you begin to clear off the\r\ntable, nor touch a single thing to wash it up, till we've been over this\r\nhouse. I want to do it now, before Mr. Craig goes out to prospect around\r\nand see what else is on the island, which, I suppose, he'll be wantin'\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I had that intention, but I was quite willing to go over\r\nthe house first.\r\n\r\n\"It's come to me,\" said Mrs. Lecks, speaking very gravely, \"that it's no\r\nuse for us to talk of the family bein' here, or bein' there, till we've\r\ngone over this house. If we find that they have, as far as we know, gone\r\naway in good health and spirits, that's all well enough; but if\r\nanything's happened in this house, I don't want to be here with what's\r\nhappened—at least, without knowin' it, and when we do go over the\r\nhouse, I want a man to go with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'd talked that way last night, Mrs. Lecks,\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nAleshine, \"I'd never slept till after sun-up, and then got up and gone\r\nhuntin' round among them frocks and petticoats to find somethin' that\r\nwould fit me, with the quiet pulse I did have, Mrs. Lecks!\"\r\n\r\nTo this remark Mrs. Lecks made no reply, but, rising, she led the way\r\nout of the kitchen and into the house.\r\n\r\nThe rooms on the first floor were very well furnished. There was a large\r\nparlor, and back of it a study or library, while on the other side of\r\nthe hall was a dining-room and an apartment probably used as a family\r\nroom. We found nothing in these which would indicate that anything\r\nuntoward had happened in them. Then we went up-stairs, I leading the\r\nway, Mrs. Lecks following, and Mrs. Aleshine in the rear. We first\r\nentered one of the front chambers, which was quite dark, but Mrs. Lecks\r\nunfastened and threw open a shutter. Then, with a rigid countenance and\r\ndetermined mien, she examined every part of the room, looked into every\r\ncloset, and even under the bed. It was quite plain that it was in one of\r\nthe chambers that she expected to find what had happened, if anything\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nThe room on the other side of the hall was very like the one we first\r\nexamined, except that it had two beds in it. We next visited the chamber\r\nrecently occupied by my two companions, which was now undergoing the\r\nprocess of \"airing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We needn't stop here,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Lecks instantly replied: \"Indeed, we will stop; I'm going to\r\nlook under the bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, putting her hand on her friend's\r\nshoulder. \"Supposin' you should find somethin', and we sleepin' here\r\nlast night! It curdles me to think of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's my duty,\" said Mrs. Lecks, severely, \"and I shall do it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd do it she did, rising from the task with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\nMy room was subjected to the same scrutiny as the others, and then we\r\nvisited some smaller rooms at the extreme back of the house, which we\r\nhad not before noticed. A garret, or loft, was reached by a steep\r\nstairway in one of these rooms, and into its dusky gloom I ventured by\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't come down, Mr. Craig,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"till you're sure\r\nthere's nothin' there. Of all places in the house, that cockloft, after\r\nall, is the most likely.\"\r\n\r\nI had none of the fears which seemed to actuate the two women, but I had\r\na very unpleasant time of it groping about in the darkness and heat,\r\nand, as the place was only partly floored, running the continual risk of\r\ncrashing down through the lath and plaster. I made myself quite sure,\r\nhowever, that nothing had happened in that loft, unless some one had\r\nsuffocated there, and had dried up and become the dust which I raised at\r\nevery step.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said Mrs. Lecks, when I descended, \"as there is no cellar,\r\nwe'll go wash up the breakfast things; and if you want to take a walk,\r\nto see if there's any genuwine heathens or anybody else a-livin' in this\r\nisland, we're not afraid to be left alone.\"\r\n\r\nFor the whole of the rest of the morning I wandered about the island. I\r\ninvestigated the paths that I had before noticed, and found that each of\r\nthem led, after a moderate walk, to some wide and pleasant part of the\r\nbeach. At one of these points I found a rustic bench; and, stuffed in\r\nbetween two of the slats which formed the seat, I found a book. It had\r\nbeen sadly wet and discolored by rain, and dried and curled up by the\r\nwind and sun. I pulled it out, and found it to be a novel in French. On\r\none of the fly-leaves was written \"Emily.\" Reasoning from the\r\ndilapidated appearance of this book, I began to believe that the family\r\nmust have left this place some time ago, and that, therefore, their\r\nreturn might be expected at a proportionately early period. On second\r\nthoughts, however, I considered that the state of this book was of\r\nlittle value as testimony. A few hours of storm, wind, and sun might\r\nhave inflicted all the damage it had sustained. The two women would be\r\nbetter able to judge by the state of the house and the condition of the\r\nprovisions how long the family had been away.\r\n\r\nI then started out on a walk along the beach, and in little more than an\r\nhour I had gone entirely around the island. Nowhere did I see any sign\r\nof habitation or occupation except at the house which had given us\r\nshelter, nor any opening through the surrounding reef except the barred\r\npassageway through which we had come.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the house, I found that Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine\r\nhad been hard at work all the morning. They had, so to speak, gone\r\nregularly and systematically to housekeeping, and had already divided\r\nthe labors of the establishment between them. Mrs. Aleshine, who prided\r\nherself on her skill in culinary matters, was to take charge of the\r\ncooking, while Mrs. Lecks assumed the care of the various rooms and the\r\ngeneral management of the household. This arrangement was explained to\r\nme at length, and when I remarked that all this seemed to indicate that\r\nthey expected to remain here for a long time, Mrs. Lecks replied:\r\n\r\n\"In my part of the country I could tell pretty close, by the dust on the\r\ntables and on the top of the pianner, how long a family had been out of\r\na house; but dust in Pennsylvany and dust on a sea island, where there's\r\nno wagons nor carriages, is quite different. This house has been left in\r\nvery good order, and though the windows wants washin', and the floors\r\nand stairs brushin',—which will be easy considerin' that none of 'em\r\nhas carpets,—and everything in the house a reg'lar cleanin' up and\r\nairin', it may be that the family hasn't been gone away very long, and\r\nso it may be a good while before they come back again. Mrs. Aleshine and\r\nme has talked it over, and we've made up our minds that the right thing\r\nto do is just to go along and attend to things as if we was a-goin' to\r\nstay here for a month or two; and it may be even longer than that before\r\nthe people come back. And I don't think they'll have anything to\r\ncomplain of when they find their house in apple-pie order, their windows\r\nwashed, their floors clean, and not a speck of dust anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"I don't see what they've got to find\r\nfault with, anyway. I look on this as part of the passage. To be sure,\r\nwe ain't movin' a bit on our way to Japan, but that's not my fault, nor\r\nyet yours, Mrs. Lecks, nor yours, Mr. Craig. We paid our passage to go\r\nto Japan, and if the ship was steered wrong and got sunk, we hadn't\r\nanything to do with it. We didn't want to come here, but here we are,\r\nand I'd like to know who's got any right to find fault with us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MRS. ALESHINE HAD BEEN HARD AT WORK ALL THE MORNING.\"]\r\n\r\n\"And bein' here,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"we'll take care of the things.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I'm concerned,\" added Mrs. Aleshine, \"if this island was\r\nmovin' on to Japan, I'd a great deal rather be on it than on that ship,\r\nwhere, to my way of thinkin', they didn't know much more about\r\nhousekeepin' than they did about steerin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think your plans and arrangements are very good,\" I said. \"But how\r\nabout the provisions? Are there enough to hold out for any time?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's pretty nigh a barrel of flour,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"a good\r\ndeal of tea and coffee and sugar, and lots of things in tins and jars.\r\nThere's a kind of cellar outside where they keep things cool, and\r\nthere's more than half a keg of butter down there. It's too strong to\r\nuse, but I can take that butter and wash it out, and work it over, and\r\nsalt it, and make it just as good butter as any we got on board the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"you have given me nothing to do. I shall not be content\r\nto stand about idle and see you do all the work.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothin' in the house,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"which you need put\r\nyour hand to; but, if you choose to go out into that garden, and see if\r\nthere's anything can be done in it, or got out of it,—that is, if you\r\nknow anything about garden work,—I'm sure we'd be very glad of any\r\nfresh vegetables we could get.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I had been accustomed to garden work in an amateur way,\r\nand would be glad to do anything that was possible in that direction.\r\n\r\n\"I never seed into that garden,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"but of all the\r\nfoolish things that ever came under my eye, the buildin' a wall around a\r\ngarden, when a picket fence would do just as well, is the foolishest.\"\r\n\r\nI explained that in these countries it was the fashion to use walls\r\ninstead of fences.\r\n\r\n\"If it's the fashion,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"I suppose there's no use\r\nsayin' anything ag'in' it; but if the fashion should happen to change,\r\nthey'd find it a good deal easier to take down a barbed-wire fence than\r\na stone wall.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place in the large lower hall, which Mrs. Lecks\r\nhad been \"putting to rights,\" and where Mrs. Aleshine had just entered\r\nfrom the kitchen. Mrs. Lecks now sat down upon a chair, and, dust-cloth\r\nin hand, she thus addressed me:\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing, Mr. Craig, that me and Mrs. Aleshine has been\r\ntalkin' about. We haven't made up our minds about it, because we didn't\r\nthink it was fair and right to do that before speakin' to you and\r\nhearin' what you had to say on one side or another of it. Mrs. Aleshine\r\nand me has had to bow our heads to afflictions, and to walk sometimes in\r\nroads we didn't want to; but we've remembered the ways in which we was\r\nbrought up, and have kept in them as far as we've been able. When our\r\nhusbands died, leavin' Mrs. Aleshine with a son, and me without any,\r\nwhich, perhaps, is just as well, for there's no knowin' how he might\r\nhave turned out—\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" interrupted Mrs. Aleshine, \"for he might have gone as a\r\nclerk to Roosher, and then you and me would 'a' had to travel different\r\nways.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when our husbands died,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"they left us\r\nenough, and plenty, to live on, and we wasn't the women to forget them\r\nand their ways of thinkin', any more than we'd forget the ways of our\r\nfathers and mothers before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said Mrs. Aleshine, fervently.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mr. Craig,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"we don't know how you've\r\nbeen brought up, nor anything about you, in fact, except that you've\r\nbeen as kind to us as if you was some sort of kin, and that we never\r\nwould have thought of comin' here without you, and so me and Mrs.\r\nAleshine has agreed to leave this whole matter to you, and to do just as\r\nyou say. When us two started out on this long journey, we didn't expect\r\nto find it what you call the path of roses, and, dear only knows, we\r\nhaven't found it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true!\" ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"And what we've had to put up with,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"we have put\r\nup with. So, Mr. Craig, whether you say dinner in the middle of the day\r\nat twelve, as we've always been used to, or at six o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, as they had it on board that ship,—and how people ever come\r\nto turn their meals hind part foremost in that way, I can't say,—we are\r\ngoin' to do it; if you've been brought up to six o'clock, you won't hear\r\nno complainin' from us, think what we may.\"\r\n\r\nI was on the point of laughing aloud at the conclusion of this speech,\r\nbut a glance at the serious faces of the two women, who, with so much\r\nearnest solicitude, awaited my reply, stopped me, and I hastened to\r\nassure them that dinner in the middle of the day would be entirely in\r\naccordance with my every wish.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, her eyes sparkling amid the plumpness\r\nof her face, while an expression of calm relief passed over the features\r\nof Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"And now I'll be off and get us somethin' to eat in less than no time,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Aleshine. \"We didn't know whether to make it lunch or dinner\r\ntill we had seen you, so you can't expect much to-day, but to-morrow\r\nwe'll begin, and have everything straight and comfortable. I'm goin' to\r\nget up early in the mornin' and bake a batch of bread, and you needn't\r\nbe afraid, Mr. Craig, but what I'll have you a bit of hot meat every\r\nnight for your supper.\"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we all visited the garden, which, although a good deal\r\novergrown with luxuriant weeds, showed marks of fair cultivation. Some\r\nof the beds had been cleared out and left to the weeds, and we found\r\nsome \"garden truck,\" as my companions called it, with which we were not\r\nfamiliar. But there were tomato-vines loaded with fruit, plenty of beans\r\nof various kinds, and a large patch of potatoes, many of which had been\r\ndug.\r\n\r\nFrom the lower end of the garden, Mrs. Aleshine gave a shout of delight.\r\nWe went to her, and found her standing before a long asparagus bed.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed. \"If there's anything that settles it firm in my\r\nmind that these people is Christians, it's this bed of grass. I don't\r\nbelieve there ever was heathens that growed grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought that was all settled when we found the bakin'-powders,\" said\r\nMrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"But this clinches it,\" answered her companion. \"I can't tell from a\r\nsparrowgrass bed what church they belong to, but they're no idolaters.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning I delivered to the genial Mrs. Aleshine a large basket\r\nfull of fresh vegetables, and we had a most excellent dinner. Somewhat\r\nto my surprise, the table was not set in the kitchen, but in the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n\"Me and Mrs. Aleshine have made up our minds,\" said Mrs. Lecks, in\r\nexplanation, \"that it's not the proper thing for you to be eatin' in the\r\nkitchen, nor for us neither. Here's table-cloths, and good glass and\r\nchina, and spoons and forks, which, although they're not solid silver,\r\nare plated good enough for anybody. Neither you nor us is servants, and\r\na kitchen is no place for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"We paid our money for first-class\r\npassages, and it was understood that we'd have everything as good as\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which I don't see as that has anything to do with it, Barb'ry\r\nAleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"for the steamship people don't generally\r\nthrow in desert islands as part of the accommodation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't ask for the island,\" retorted Mrs. Aleshine, \"and if they'd\r\nsteered the ship right we shouldn't have wanted it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished our dinner, Mrs. Lecks pushed back her chair, and\r\nsat for a few moments in thought, as was her wont before saying anything\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing,\" said she, \"that I've been thinkin' about,\r\nthough I haven't spoke of it yet, even to Mrs. Aleshine. We haven't no\r\nright to come here and eat up the victuals and use the things of the\r\npeople that own this house, without payin' for 'em. Of course, we're not\r\ngoin' to sleep on the bare ground and starve to death while there's beds\r\nand food close to our hands. But if we use 'em and take it, we ought to\r\npay the people that the place belongs to—that is, if we've got the\r\nmoney to do it with—and Mrs. Aleshine and me has got the money. When we\r\nwent down into our cabin to get ready to leave the ship, the first thing\r\nwe did was to put our purses in our pockets, and we've both got drafts\r\nwrapped up in oil silk, and sewed inside our frock-bodies; and if you\r\ndidn't think to bring your money along with you, Mr. Craig, we can lend\r\nyou all you need.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked her for her offer, but stated that I had brought with me all\r\nmy money.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"it's my opinion that we ought to pay our\r\nboard regular every week. I don't know what is commonly charged in a\r\nplace like this, but I know you can get very good board where I come\r\nfrom for six dollars a week.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THERE'S ANOTHER THING,' SAID SHE, 'THAT I'VE BEEN\r\nTHINKIN' ABOUT.'\"]\r\n\r\n\"That is for two in a room,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"but havin' a room to\r\nhimself would make it more for Mr. Craig.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't his fault,\" said Mrs. Lecks, somewhat severely, \"that he\r\nain't got a brother or some friend to take part of the room and pay part\r\nof the expense. But, anyway, the room isn't a large one, and I don't\r\nthink he ought to pay much more for having a room to himself. Seven\r\ndollars is quite enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But then you've got to consider,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that we do the\r\ncookin' and housework, and that ought to be counted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was comin' to that,\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"Now, if me and Mrs. Aleshine\r\nwas to go out to service, which you may be sure we wouldn't do unless\r\ncircumstances was very different from what they are now—\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true!\" earnestly ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"But if we was to do it,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"we wouldn't go into\r\nanybody's family for less than two dollars a week. Now, I've always\r\nheard that wages is low in this part of the world, and the work isn't\r\nheavy for two of us; so, considering the family isn't here to make their\r\nown bargain, I think we'd better put our wages at that, so that'll make\r\nfour dollars a week for each of us two to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about Mr. Craig?\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"He oughtn't to work in\r\nthat garden for nothin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty cents a day,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"is as little as any man would\r\nwork for, and then it oughtn't to take all his time. That will make\r\nthree dollars to take out of Mr. Craig's board, and leave it four\r\ndollars a week, the same as ours.\"\r\n\r\nI declared myself perfectly satisfied with these arrangements, but Mrs.\r\nAleshine did not seem to be altogether convinced that they were just.\r\n\r\n\"When a woman goes out to service,\" said she, \"she gets her board and\r\nis paid wages besides, and it's the same for gardeners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"that we ought to\r\ncharge these people with our wages, and make 'em pay it when they come\r\nback!\"\r\n\r\nThis remark apparently disposed of Mrs. Aleshine's objections, and her\r\nfriend continued: \"There's a jar on the mantelpiece there, of the kind\r\nthe East Indy ginger comes in. It's got nothin' in it now but some brown\r\npaper in which fish-hooks is wrapped. We came here on a Wednesday, and\r\nso every Tuesday night we'll each put four dollars in that jar, under\r\nthe fish-hook paper; then if, by night or by day, the family comes back\r\nand makes a fuss about our bein' here, all we have to say is, 'The board\r\nmoney's in the ginger-jar,' and our consciences is free.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks's plan was adopted as a very just and proper one, and at the\r\nexpiration of the week we each deposited four dollars in the ginger-jar.\r\n\r\nWhile occupying this house I do not think that any of us endeavored to\r\npry into the private concerns of the family who owned it, although we\r\neach had a very natural curiosity to know something about said family.\r\nOpportunities of acquiring such knowledge, however, were exceedingly\r\nscarce. Even if we had been willing to look into such receptacles, the\r\nseveral desks and secretaries that the house contained were all locked,\r\nand nowhere could Mrs. Lecks or Mrs. Aleshine find an old letter or\r\npiece of wrapping-paper with an address on it. I explained to my\r\ncompanions that letters and packages were not likely to come to a place\r\nlike this, but they kept a sharp lookout for anything of the kind,\r\nasserting that there could be no possible harm in reading the names of\r\nthe people whose house they were in.\r\n\r\nIn some of the books in the library, which were English and French in\r\nabout equal proportions, with a few volumes in German, I found written\r\non the blank pages the names \"Emily\" and \"Lucille,\" and across the\r\ntitle-pages of some French histories was inscribed, in a man's hand, \"A.\r\nDusante.\" We discussed these names, but could not make up our minds\r\nwhether the family were French or English. For instance, there was no\r\nreason why an Englishwoman might not be called Lucille, and even such a\r\nsurname as Dusante was not uncommon either among English or Americans.\r\nThe labels on the boxes and tins of provisions showed that most of them\r\ncame from San Francisco, but this was likely to be the case, no matter\r\nwhat the nationality of the family.\r\n\r\nThe question of the relationship of the three persons, of whose\r\nexistence we had discovered traces, was a very interesting one to Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make up my mind,\" said the latter, \"whether Emily is the mother\r\nof Lucille or her daughter, or whether they are both children of Mr.\r\nDusante, or whether he's married to Lucille and Emily is his\r\nsister-in-law, or whether she's his sister and not hers, or whether he's\r\nthe uncle and they're his nieces, or whether Emily is an old lady and\r\nMr. Dusante and Lucille are both her children, or whether they are two\r\nmaiden ladies and Mr. Dusante is their brother, or whether Mr. Dusante\r\nis only a friend of the family, and boards here because no two women\r\nought to live in such a lonely place without a man in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"whether Mr. Dusante comes back with two\r\nnieces, or a wife and daughter, or Mrs. Dusante and a mother-in-law, or\r\na pair of sisters, all we've got to say is, 'The board money's in the\r\nginger-jar,' and let 'em do their worst.\"\r\n\r\nIn my capacity as gardener I do not think I earned the wages which my\r\ncompanions had allotted to me, for I merely gathered and brought in such\r\nfruits and vegetables as I found in proper condition for use. In other\r\nways, however, I made my services valuable to our little family. In a\r\ncloset in my chamber I found guns and ammunition, and frequently I was\r\nable to bring in a few birds. Some of these were pronounced by Mrs.\r\nAleshine unsuitable for the table, but others she cooked with much\r\nskill, and they were found to be very good eating.\r\n\r\nNot far from the little wharf which has been mentioned there stood,\r\nconcealed by a mass of low-growing palms, a boat-house in which was a\r\nlittle skiff hung up near the roof. This I let down and launched, and\r\nfound great pleasure in rowing it about the lagoon. There was\r\nfishing-tackle in the boat-house, which I used with success, the lagoon\r\nabounding in fish. Offerings of this kind were much more acceptable to\r\nMrs. Aleshine than birds.\r\n\r\n\"There's some kinds of fishes that's better than others,\" said she,\r\n\"but, as a gen'ral rule, a fish is a fish, and if you catch 'em you can\r\neat 'em; but it's a very different thing with birds. When you've never\r\nseen 'em before, how are you goin' to tell but what they're some kin to\r\nan owl, a pigeon-hawk, or a crow? And if I once get it into my head that\r\nthere's any of that kind of family blood in 'em, they disagree with me\r\njust the same as if there really was.\"\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, as I was returning in the boat from the point on the\r\nother side of the island where I had found the rustic seat and Emily's\r\nbook, I was surprised to see Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine standing on\r\nthe end of the little wharf. This was an unusual thing for them to do,\r\nas they were very industrious women and seldom had an idle moment, and\r\nit seemed to be one of their greatest pleasures to discuss the work they\r\nwere going to do when they had finished that on which they were then\r\nengaged. I was curious, therefore, to know why they should be standing\r\nthus idly on the wharf, and pulled toward them as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MRS. LECKS AND MRS. ALESHINE STANDING ON THE END OF THE\r\nLITTLE WHARF.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen I had rowed near enough to hear them, Mrs. Aleshine remarked with\r\ncheerful placidity:\r\n\r\n\"The Dusantes are comin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe tide was quite low, and I could not see over the reef; but in a few\r\nmoments I had grounded the skiff and had sprung upon the wharf. Out on\r\nthe ocean, about a mile away, I saw a boat, apparently a large one,\r\napproaching the island.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"you'll soon see whether\r\nit's his two nieces, or his daughters, wife and sister-in-law, or\r\nwhatever of them other relationships which you've got so pat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"but, what's more, we'll find out if he's\r\ngoin' to be satisfied with the board money we've put in the ginger-jar.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the boat which we saw approaching the island had come near enough\r\nfor us to distinguish its occupants, we found that it contained five\r\npersons. Three sat in the stern, and two were rowing. Of those in the\r\nstern, we soon made out one to be a woman, and after putting our\r\neyesight to its very best efforts, we were obliged to admit that there\r\nwas only one female on board.\r\n\r\n\"Now, that's disapp'intin',\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for I've wondered and\r\nwondered which I should like best, Emily or Lucille, and now that only\r\none of 'em has come, of course I can't tell.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat came on, almost directly toward the passageway in the reef, and\r\nit was not long before the two women had been able to decide that Mr.\r\nDusante was an elderly man, and that the lady was moderately young, and\r\nin all probability his daughter.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that the mother, whether she was\r\nEmily, or whether she was Lucille, has died, and for that reason they\r\nare comin' back sooner than they expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope you're wrong there, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks,\r\n\"for they'll see lots of things here that will freshen up their\r\naffliction, and that won't make 'em any too lively people to be with.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"it may be that Emily, or else\r\nLucille, has got married, and has gone away with her husband to travel,\r\nand by the time she's got a little baby she'll come here to live on\r\naccount of the sea air for the child, and that'll make the house\r\npleasant, Mrs. Lecks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know how long you expect to live here,\" said Mrs. Lecks,\r\nregarding her friend with some severity.\r\n\r\n\"That's not for me to say,\" replied Mrs. Aleshine, \"knowin' nothin'\r\nabout it. But this I will say, that I hope they have brought along with\r\nthem some indigo blue, for I nearly used up all there was the last time\r\nI washed.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue I had been thinking that it was a very strange\r\nthing for the owners of this place to visit their island in such a\r\nfashion. Why should they be in an open boat? And where did they come\r\nfrom? Wherever they might live, it was not at all probable that they\r\nwould choose to be rowed from that point to this. From the general\r\ncharacter and appointments of the house in which we had found a refuge,\r\nit was quite plain that its owners were people in good circumstances,\r\nwho were in the habit of attending to their domestic affairs in a very\r\norderly and proper way. It was to be presumed that it was their custom\r\nto come here in a suitable vessel, and to bring with them the stores\r\nneeded during their intended stay. Now, there could be little or nothing\r\nin that boat, and, on the whole, I did not believe it contained the\r\nowners of this island.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, however, to assume anything of the kind. There might\r\nhave been a disaster; in fact, I know nothing about it, but it was my\r\nimmediate duty to go and meet these people at the passage, for, if they\r\nwere unable to unlock the bars, their boat could not enter, and I must\r\nferry them across the lagoon. Without communicating my doubts to my\r\ncompanions, I hurried into the skiff, and pulled as far as possible into\r\nthe passage through the reef. The bars, of which there were more than I\r\nat first supposed, were so arranged that it was impossible for a boat to\r\ngo in or out at any stage of the tide.\r\n\r\nI had been there but a few minutes when the boat from without came\r\nslowly in between the rocks; and almost as soon as I saw it, its\r\nprogress was suddenly stopped by a sunken bar.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" cried several men at once.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" cried I, in return. \"Have you the key to these bars?\"\r\n\r\nA stout man with a red beard stood up in the stern. \"Key?\" said he,\r\n\"what key?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not belong here?\" said I. \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nAt this, the gentleman who was sitting by the lady arose to his feet. He\r\nwas a man past middle age, rather tall and slim, and when he stood up\r\nthe slight rolling of the boat made him stagger, and he came near\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better sit down, sir,\" said the man with the red beard, who I saw\r\nwas a sailor. \"You can talk better that way.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman now seated himself, and thus addressed me:\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir, the Reverend Mr. Enderton, lately missionary to Nanfouchong,\r\nChina, and this is my daughter, Miss Enderton. We are returning to the\r\nUnited States by way of the Sandwich Islands, and took passage in a\r\nsailing-vessel for Honolulu. About two weeks ago this vessel, in some\r\nway which I do not understand, became disabled—\"\r\n\r\n\"Rotten forem'st,\" interrupted the man with the red beard, \"which give\r\nway in a gale; strained and leaky, besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know the mast was rotten,\" said the gentleman, \"but, since\r\nthe occasion of our first really serviceable wind, she has been making\r\nvery unsatisfactory progress. And, more than that, the whole force of\r\nseamen was employed night and day in endeavoring to keep the water out\r\nof the tea, thereby causing such a thumping and pounding that sleep was\r\nout of the question. Add to this the fact that our meals became very\r\nirregular, and were sometimes entirely overlooked—\"\r\n\r\n\"Prog was gettin' mighty short,\" interpolated the red-bearded man.\r\n\r\n\"You can easily discern, sir,\" continued the gentleman, \"that it was\r\nimpossible for myself and my daughter to remain longer on that vessel,\r\non which we were the only passengers. I therefore requested the captain\r\nto put us ashore at the nearest land, and, after more than a week of\r\ndelay and demur, he consented to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it,\" said the man, \"till there was land nigh enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain informed me,\" continued the gentleman, \"that this island\r\nwas inhabited, and that I could here find shelter and repose until a\r\nvessel could be sent from Honolulu to take me off. He furnished me with\r\nthis boat and three seamen, one of whom,\" pointing to the red-bearded\r\nman, \"is a coxswain. We have been rowing ever since early this morning,\r\nwith but a very moderate quantity of food and much discomfort. Now, sir,\r\nyou have heard my story; and I ask you, as one man to another, if you\r\nstill intend to bar your water-gates against us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not bar the gates,\" I said, \"and I would gladly unlock them if I\r\ncould. I belong to a shipwrecked party who took refuge here some two\r\nweeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you get in?\" hastily inquired the red-bearded coxswain.\r\n\r\n\"Our boat sunk when we were within sight of the island, and we came here\r\non life-preservers, and so got under the bars.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men who had been rowing now turned suddenly and looked at me.\r\nThey both had black beards, and they both exclaimed at the same moment,\r\n\"By George!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't stop here to tell any more of our story,\" said I. \"The great\r\npoint now is to get you all ashore, and have you cared for.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said the coxswain. And the two sailors murmured, \"Aye, aye,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nThe bar which stopped the progress of the larger boat was just under the\r\nsurface of the water, while another a foot above the water kept my skiff\r\nabout six feet distant from the other boat. There was some loose\r\nflooring in the bottom of the coxswain's boat, and he ordered two of the\r\nboards taken out, and with them a bridge was made, one end resting on\r\nthe bow of the larger boat, and the other on the iron bar by my skiff.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the coxswain, \"let the lady go first.\"\r\n\r\nThe elderly gentleman arose, as if he would prefer to take the lead, but\r\nhis daughter, who had not yet spoken a word, was passed forward by the\r\ncoxswain, steadied over the bridge by one of the sailors, and assisted\r\nby me into the skiff. Then her father came aboard, and I rowed with them\r\nto the wharf.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine came forward most cordially to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dusante, I suppose?\" said Mrs. Lecks, while Mrs. Aleshine hurriedly\r\nwhispered in my ear, \"Is it Lucille or Emily?\"\r\n\r\nAs quickly as possible I explained the situation. For a few moments Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine stood speechless. Nothing which had happened to\r\nthem, the wreck of the steamer, the sinking of the boat, or our\r\nexperience with life-preservers, affected them so much as this\r\ndisappointment in regard to the problem of the Dusante family. Travel by\r\nsea was all novel and strange to them, and they had expected all sorts\r\nof things to which they were not accustomed, but they had never\r\nimagined that Fate would be so hard upon them as to snatch away the\r\nsolution of this mystery just as they were about to put their hands upon\r\nit. But, in spite of this sudden blow, the two good women quickly\r\nrecovered themselves, and with hearty and kindly words hurried the\r\nmissionary and his daughter to the house, while I went to bring over the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI found the three sailors busy in securing their boat so that it would\r\nnot be injured by the rocks during the rising and falling of the tide.\r\nWhen they had finished this job, they had to do a good deal of\r\nscrambling before they reached my skiff.\r\n\r\n\"We thought at first, sir,\" said the coxswain, as I rowed them across\r\nthe lagoon, \"that it was all gammon about your not livin' here, and\r\nhavin' no keys to them bars; but we've come to the 'pinion that if you'd\r\nbeen able to unlock 'em you'd have done it sooner than take all this\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\nI now related my story more fully, and the men were greatly astonished\r\nwhen they heard that my companions in this adventure were two women.\r\nUpon my asking the coxswain why he had come to this island, he replied\r\nthat his captain had heard that people lived on it, although he knew\r\nnothing about them; and that, as it would be almost impossible to get\r\nhis brig here with the wind that was then prevailing, and as he did not\r\nwish to go out of his course anyway, he made up his mind that he would\r\nrather lose the services of three men than keep that missionary on board\r\na day longer.\r\n\r\n\"You see, sir,\" said the coxswain, as we went ashore, \"the parson\r\nwouldn't never take it into account that we were short of prog, and\r\nleakin' like Sam Hill; and because things were uncomfortable he growled\r\nup and he growled down, till he was wuss for the spirits of the men than\r\nthe salt water comin' in or the hard-tack givin' out, and there was\r\ndanger, if he wasn't got rid of, that he'd be pitched overboard and left\r\nto take his chances for a whale. And then, by sendin' us along, that\r\ngive the crew three half-rations a day extry, and that'll count for a\r\ngood deal in the fix they're in.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the house I took the men into the kitchen, where Mrs.\r\nAleshine already had the table spread. There were bread and cold meat,\r\nwhile the tea-kettle steamed by the fire. In a very short time three\r\nhappy mariners sat round that table, while Mrs. Aleshine, with beaming\r\nface, attended to their wants, and plied them with innumerable\r\nquestions. They had not finished eating when Mrs. Lecks entered the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\"I put that minister and his daughter in the two front bedrooms,\" said\r\nshe to me, after hospitably greeting the three men, \"which me and Mrs.\r\nAleshine had run and got ready for the Dusantes, as soon as you went in\r\nyour boat to meet 'em. The young lady was mighty nigh worn out, and glad\r\nenough of the tea and things, and to get into bed. But the gentleman he\r\nwanted a soft-boiled egg, and when I told him I hadn't come across no\r\nhen-house yet on this island, he looked at me as if he didn't half\r\nbelieve me, and thought I was keepin' the eggs to sell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which it would be ridiculous to do,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"in the middle\r\nof an ocean like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he lets you off with soft-b'iled eggs, ma'am,\" said the coxswain,\r\nvery respectfully, \"I think you may bless your stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" said the two sailors with black beards.\r\n\r\nMiss Ruth Enderton and her father did not make their appearance until\r\nthe next morning at breakfast-time. I found the young lady a very\r\npleasant person. She was rather slight in figure, inclined to be pretty,\r\nand was what might be called a warm-colored blonde. Her disposition was\r\nquite sociable, and she almost immediately stepped into the favor of\r\nMrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton, however, was a person of another sort. He was a prim and\r\nsomewhat formal man, and appeared to be entirely self-engrossed, with\r\nvery vague notions in regard to his surroundings. He was not by any\r\nmeans an ill-tempered man, being rather inclined to be placid than\r\notherwise; but he gave so little attention to circumstances and events\r\nthat he did not appear to understand why he should be incommoded by the\r\nhappenings of life. I have no doubt that he made existence on board the\r\ndisabled brig a hundred times more unsatisfactory than it would\r\notherwise have been. With his present condition he seemed very well\r\nsatisfied, and it was quite plain that he looked upon Mrs. Lecks, Mrs.\r\nAleshine, and myself as the proprietors of the establishment, having\r\nforgotten, or paid no attention to, my statement in regard to our coming\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she thought it fit and proper—and this moment arrived in the\r\ncourse of the first forenoon—Mrs. Lecks spoke to Mr. Enderton on the\r\nsubject of the board which should be paid to the Dusantes. She stated\r\nthe arrangements we had made in the matter, and then told him that as he\r\nand his daughter had the best accommodations in the house, each\r\noccupying a large, handsome room, she thought that he should pay fifteen\r\ndollars a week for the two.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if your daughter,\" she continued, \"can do anything about the house\r\nwhich will be of real help, though for the life of me I don't see what\r\nshe can find to do, with me and Mrs. Aleshine here, somethin' might be\r\ntook off on account of her services; but of course you, sir, can't do\r\nnothin', unless you was to preach on Sundays, and not knowin' what\r\ndenomination the Dusantes belong to, it wouldn't be fair to take their\r\nmoney to pay for the preachin' of doctrines which, perhaps, they don't\r\nbelieve in.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MR. ENDERTON WAS A PERSON OF ANOTHER SORT.\"]\r\n\r\nThis financial proposal aroused Mr. Enderton's opposition. \"When I came\r\nhere, madam,\" he said, \"I did not expect to pay any board whatever, and\r\nI think, moreover, that your rates are exorbitant. In Nanfouchong, if I\r\nremember rightly, the best of board did not cost more than two or three\r\ndollars a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to say anything, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"which might look\r\ndisrespectful, but as long as I've got a conscience inside of me I'm\r\nnot goin' to stay here and see the Dusantes lose money by Chinese\r\ncheapness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about the Dusantes,\" said Mr. Enderton, \"but I am\r\nnot going to pay fifteen dollars a week for board for myself and\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe discussion lasted for some time, with considerable warmth on each\r\nside, and was at last ended by Mr. Enderton agreeing to pay board at the\r\nsame rate as the two women and myself, and each week to deposit in the\r\nginger-jar eight dollars for himself and daughter.\r\n\r\n\"You may not care to remember, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecks, with cold\r\nseverity, \"that Mr. Craig and me and Mrs. Aleshine puts in services\r\nbesides, although, to be sure, they don't go into the jar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only remember,\" said Mr. Enderton, \"that I am paying an unjustifiable\r\nprice as it is.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, however, were not at all of this opinion,\r\nand they agreed that, if it should be in their power, they would see to\r\nit that the Dusantes lost nothing by this close-fisted missionary.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner—and I may remark that the newcomers were not consulted in\r\nregard to the hours for meals—Mrs. Lecks had an interview with the\r\ncoxswain on the subject of board for himself and his two companions.\r\nThis affair, however, was very quickly settled, for the three mariners\r\nhad among them only one dollar and forty-three cents, and this, the\r\ncoxswain explained, they would like to keep for tobacco. It was\r\ntherefore settled that, as the three sailors could pay no money, as much\r\nwork as possible should be got out of them, and to this plan they\r\nagreed heartily and cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one thing we'll ask, ma'am,\" said the coxswain to Mrs.\r\nLecks, \"and that is that we be put in a different mess from the parson.\r\nWe've now eat two meals with the passengers, and me and my mates is\r\nagreed that that's about as much as we can go.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, therefore, the three men had their meals in the kitchen,\r\nwhere they were generally joined by Mrs. Aleshine, who much delighted in\r\ntheir company. But she made it a point sometimes to sit down with us in\r\nthe dining-room, merely to show that she had as much right there as\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\n\"As to the work for them sailormen,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"I don't see\r\nwhat they're goin' to do. Of course they don't know nothin' about\r\ngardenin', and it seems to me that the best thing to be done is to put\r\n'em to fishin'.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks considered this a good suggestion, and accordingly the\r\ncoxswain and his companions were told that thereafter they would be\r\nexpected to fish for eight hours a day, Sundays excepted. This plan,\r\nhowever, did not work very well. During the first two days the sailors\r\ncaught so many fish that, although the fishermen themselves had\r\nexcellent appetites for such food, it was found utterly impossible to\r\nconsume what they brought in. Consequently, it was ordered that\r\nthereafter they should catch only as many fish as should be needed, and\r\nthen make themselves useful by assisting Mrs. Aleshine and Mrs. Lecks in\r\nany manner they might direct.\r\n\r\nI found it quite easy to become acquainted with Miss Ruth Enderton, as\r\nshe was very much inclined to conversation. \"It's ever so long,\" she\r\nsaid, \"since I've had anybody to talk to.\"\r\n\r\nShe had left the United States when she was quite a little girl, and had\r\nsince seen nothing of her native land. She was, consequently, full of\r\nquestions about America, although quite willing to talk of her life in\r\nChina. Society, at least such kind as she had ever cared for, had been\r\nextremely scarce in the little missionary station at which she had lived\r\nso long, and now, coming from a wearisome sojourn on a disabled\r\nsailing-vessel, with no company but the crew and a preoccupied father,\r\nshe naturally was delighted to get among people she could talk to. With\r\nMrs. Lecks, Mrs. Aleshine, and myself she soon became very friendly, and\r\nshowed herself to be a most lively and interesting young person.\r\n\r\nI did all that I could to make Miss Ruth's time pass agreeably. I rowed\r\nwith her on the lagoon, taught her to fish, and showed her all the\r\npleasant points on the island which could be easily reached by walking.\r\nMr. Enderton gave us very little of his company, for, having discovered\r\nthat there was a library in the house, he passed most of his time in\r\nthat room.\r\n\r\n\"You have made a very fair selection of books, sir,\" he remarked to me,\r\n\"but it may readily be conceived, from the character of the works, that\r\nyour tastes are neither ecclesiastic nor scientific.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral times I explained to him the ownership of the library and the\r\nhouse, but he immediately forgot what I had said, or paid no attention\r\nto it. When he paid his board at the end of the week, he handed the\r\nmoney to Mrs. Lecks; and although before his eyes she put it into the\r\nginger-jar, beneath the paper of fish-hooks, I know very well that he\r\nconsidered he was paying it to her for her own use and behoof. He was\r\ncomfortably lodged, he had all that he needed—and very nearly all that\r\nhe wanted—to eat, and I do not know that I ever saw a man more\r\ncontented with his lot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I DID ALL THAT I COULD TO MAKE MISS RUTH'S TIME PASS\r\nAGREEABLY.\"]\r\n\r\nAs for the coxswain and the two sailors, they had a very pleasant time\r\nof it, but Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine would not think of such a thing\r\nas allowing them to eat in idleness the bread of the Dusantes. After\r\nthey had been with us a few days, Mrs. Lecks told me that she thought\r\nshe could show the coxswain and his mates how to dig and gather the\r\ngarden-stuff which was daily needed.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said she, \"that work goes ag'in' part of your board, but\r\nfishin' and bringin' in fire-wood don't take up quarter of the time of\r\nthem sailors, and so that the garden work is done, I don't suppose it\r\nmatters to the Dusantes who does it. And that'll give you more time to\r\nmake things pleasant for Miss Ruth, for, as far as I can see, there\r\nisn't a thing for her to do, even if she knows how to do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe three mariners were more than willing to do anything desired by Mrs.\r\nLecks or Mrs. Aleshine, to whom they looked up with great admiration and\r\nrespect. The latter was their favorite, not only because she was with\r\nthem a great deal during their meals and at other times, but because of\r\nher genial nature and easy sociability. The men were always trying to\r\nlighten her labors, and to do something that would please her.\r\n\r\nOne of them climbed to the top of what she called a \"palm-leaf-fan\r\ntree,\" and brought therefrom some broad leaves, which he cut and trimmed\r\nand sewed, in true nautical fashion, until he made some fans which were\r\nheavy and clumsy, but, as he said, they would stand half a gale of wind\r\nif she chose to raise it. The coxswain caught or trapped two sea-birds,\r\nand, having clipped their wings, he spent days in endeavoring to tame\r\nthem, hoping to induce them, as far as the power in them lay, to take\r\nthe place of the barn-yard fowls whose absence Mrs. Aleshine continually\r\ndeplored. Every evening the two black-bearded sailors would dance\r\nhornpipes for her, much to her diversion and delight.\r\n\r\n\"I've often heard,\" she remarked, \"that in these hot cocoanut countries\r\nthe tricks of the monkeys was enough to keep everybody on a steady\r\nlaugh, but I'm sure sailormen is a great deal better. When you get tired\r\nof their pranks and their tomfooleries you can tell 'em to stop, which\r\nwith monkeys you can't.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about ten days after the arrival of the missionary's party that,\r\nas I was going to get ready the boat in which Miss Ruth and myself\r\ngenerally rowed in the cool of the evening, I saw Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.\r\nAleshine sitting on the beach in the shade of some low-growing trees.\r\nThey were evidently waiting for me, and as soon as I appeared Mrs. Lecks\r\nbeckoned to me; whereupon I joined them.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"there's somethin' I want to talk to you\r\nabout. Mrs. Aleshine and me have made up our minds that you ought to be\r\nhurried up a little about poppin' the question to Miss Ruth.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark astounded me. \"Popping the question!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Mrs. Lecks, \"and me and Mrs. Aleshine know very well\r\nthat you haven't done it yet, for both of us havin' been through that\r\nsort of thing ourselves, we know the signs of it after it has\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we wouldn't say nothin' to hurry you,\" added Mrs. Aleshine, \"if it\r\nwasn't that the groceries, especially the flour, is a-gettin' low. We've\r\nbeen talkin' to them sailormen, and they're pretty well agreed that\r\nthere's no use now in expectin' their captain to send for 'em; for if he\r\nwas a-goin' to do it at all, he'd 'a' done it before this. And perhaps\r\nhe never got nowhere himself, in which case he couldn't. And they say\r\nthe best thing we can all do when the victuals has nearly give out,\r\nprovided the Dusantes don't come back in time, is to take what's left,\r\nand all get into their big boat, and row away to that island, which I\r\ndon't know just how far it is, that the captain of our ship was goin'\r\nto. There we can stay pretty comfortable till a ship comes along and\r\ntakes us off.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has all that to do,\" I asked, \"with Miss Ruth and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\" cried Mrs. Lecks. \"It has everythin' to do. When it's all settled\r\nand fixed between you and Miss Ruth, there'll be nothin' to hinder us\r\nfrom gettin' ready to start when we please.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear friends,\" I said with much earnestness, \"I have not the\r\nslightest idea of proposing to Miss Enderton.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I said to Mrs. Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"and that's\r\nthe reason we let our irons cool, and come out here to talk to you. It's\r\njust like a young man to keep puttin' off that sort of thing, but this\r\ncan't be put off.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine; \"and I'll just let you see how the\r\nmatter stands. There is housekeepers who allows a pint of flour a day to\r\neach person, but this is for farm-hands and people who works hard and\r\neats hearty, and I've found that three quarters of a pint will do very\r\nwell, if the dough is kneaded conscientious and made up light, so that\r\nit'll rise well when it's put into the oven. Now I've measured all the\r\nflour that's left, and me and Mrs. Lecks we've calculated that, allowin'\r\nthree quarters of a pint of flour a day to each one of us, there's just\r\neight days more that we can stay here—that is, if the Dusantes don't\r\ncome back before that time, which, of course, can't be counted on. So\r\nyou can see for yourself, Mr. Craig, there's no time to be lost, even\r\nconsiderin' that she hasn't to make up anything to be married in.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEY WERE EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR ME.\"]\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"just for us and three sailors, that wouldn't be\r\nneeded.\"\r\n\r\nI looked from one to the other in dumb astonishment. Mrs. Lecks gave me\r\nno time to say anything.\r\n\r\n\"In common cases,\" said she, \"this might all be put off till we got\r\nsomewhere; but it won't do now. Here you are, with everythin' in your\r\nown hands, but just get away from here, and there's an end of that.\r\nShe's as pretty a girl as you'll see in a month of Sundays, and if she\r\nleaves here without your gettin' her, there's no knowing who'll snap her\r\nup. When we've got to that island, you may see her once a week, but\r\nmaybe you won't. She may go away in one ship, and you in another, and\r\nthere may be somebody right there—a missionary, for all I know—who'll\r\nhave her before you have a chance to put in a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's not the worst of it,\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"Supposin' them\r\nDusantes come back before we go. There's no knowin' what that Mr.\r\nDusante is. He may be a brother of Emily and Lucille. And what sort of a\r\nchance would you have then, I'd like to know, with Miss Ruth right here\r\nin his own house, and he ownin' the rowboat, and everythin'? Or it may\r\nbe he's a widower, and that'll be a mighty sight worse, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter whether they're widowers or never been married,\" said Mrs.\r\nLecks, \"there'll be plenty that'll want her as soon as they see her; and\r\nif it isn't for the girl's own pretty face, it'll be for her father's\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her father's money!\" I exclaimed. \"What are you talking of?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no good tellin' me anything about that,\" said Mrs. Lecks, very\r\ndecidedly. \"There never was a man as close-fisted as Mr. Enderton who\r\nhadn't money.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know as well as we do,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that in them\r\ncountries where he's been the heathens worship idols of silver and idols\r\nof gold, and when them heathens is converted, don't you suppose the\r\nmissionaries get any of that? I expect that Mr. Enderton has converted\r\nthousands of heathens.\"\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion I laughed outright. But Mrs. Lecks reproved me.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Craig,\" said she, \"this is no laughin' matter. What me and\r\nMrs. Aleshine is sayin' is for your good, and for the good of Miss Ruth\r\nalong with you. I haven't much opinion of her father, but his money is\r\nas good as anybody else's, and though they had to leave their trunks on\r\nboard their ship, what little they brought with them shows that they've\r\nbeen used to havin' the best there is. Mrs. Aleshine and me has set up\r\ntill late into the night talkin' over this thing, and we are both of one\r\nmind that you two need never expect to have the same chance again that\r\nyou've got now. The very fact that the old gentleman is a preacher, and\r\ncan marry you on the spot, ought to make you tremble when you think of\r\nthe risks you are runnin' by puttin' it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to go into the house now to see about supper,\" said Mrs.\r\nAleshine, rising, \"and I hope you'll remember, Mr. Craig, when your\r\nbread is on your plate, and Miss Ruth is sittin' opposite to you, that\r\nthree quarters of a pint of flour a day is about as little as anybody\r\ncan live on, and that time is flyin'.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks now also rose. But I detained the two for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have not said anything to Miss Enderton on this subject,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mrs. Aleshine, \"we haven't. We are both agreed that as\r\nyou're the one that's to do what's to be done, you are the one that's to\r\nbe spoke to. And havin' been through it ourselves, we understand well\r\nenough that the more a woman don't know nothin' about it, the more\r\nlikely she is to be ketched if she wants to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe two women left me in an amused but also somewhat annoyed state of\r\nmind. I had no intention whatever of proposing to Miss Ruth Enderton.\r\nShe was a charming girl, very bright and lively, and withal, I had\r\nreason to believe, very sensible. But it was not yet a fortnight since I\r\nfirst saw her, and no thought of marrying her had entered into my head.\r\nHad Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, or, more important than all, had Miss\r\nEnderton, any reason to believe that I was acting the part of a lover?\r\n\r\nThe latter portion of this question was almost immediately answered to\r\nmy satisfaction by the appearance of Miss Ruth, who came skipping down\r\nto me and calling out to me in that free and hearty manner with which a\r\nwoman addresses a friend or near acquaintance, but never a suspected\r\nlover. She betrayed no more notion of the Lecks and Aleshine scheme than\r\non the day I first met her.\r\n\r\nBut, as I was rowing her over the lagoon, I felt a certain constraint\r\nwhich I had not known before. There was no ground whatever for the wild\r\nimaginings of the two women, but the fact that they had imagined\r\ninterfered very much with the careless freedom with which I had\r\npreviously talked to Miss Ruth. I do not think, however, that she\r\nnoticed any change in me, for she chatted and laughed, and showed, as\r\nshe had done from the first, the rare delight which she took in this\r\nnovel island life.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the house, we were met by Mrs. Aleshine. \"I am goin'\r\nto give you two your supper,\" she said, \"on that table there under the\r\ntree. We all had ours a little earlier than common, as the sailormen\r\nseemed hungry; and I took your father's to him in the libr'ry, where I\r\nexpect he's a-sittin' yet, holdin' a book in one hand and stirrin' his\r\ntea with the other, till he's stirred out nearly every drop on the\r\nfloor; which, however, won't matter at all, for in the mornin' I'll rub\r\nup that floor till it's as bright as new.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan delighted Miss Ruth, but I saw in it the beginning of the\r\nworkings of a deep-laid scheme. I was just about to sit down when Mrs.\r\nAleshine said to me in a low voice, as she left us:\r\n\r\n\"Remember that the first three quarters of a pint apiece begins now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine are perfectly\r\ncharming?\" said Miss Ruth, as she poured out the tea. \"They always seem\r\nto be trying to think of some kind thing to do for other people.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed entirely with Miss Enderton's remark, but I could not help\r\nthinking of the surprise she would feel if she knew of the kind thing\r\nthat these two women were trying to do for her.\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken any steps yet?\" asked Mrs. Lecks of me, the next day. On\r\nmy replying that I had taken no steps of the kind to which I supposed\r\nshe alluded, she walked away with a very grave and serious face.\r\n\r\nA few hours later Mrs. Aleshine came to me. \"There's another reason for\r\nhurryin' up,\" said she. \"Them sailormen seems able to do without 'most\r\nanything in this world except tobacco, and Mrs. Lecks has been sellin'\r\nit to 'em out of a big box she found in a closet up-stairs, at five\r\ncents a teacupful,—which I think is awful cheap, but she says prices in\r\nislands is always low,—and wrapping the money up in a paper, with 'Cash\r\npaid by sailormen for tobacco' written on it, and puttin' it into the\r\nginger-jar with the board money. But their dollar and forty-three cents\r\nis nearly gone, and Mrs. Lecks she says that not a whiff of Mr.\r\nDusante's tobacco shall they have if they can't pay for it. And when\r\nthey have nothin' to smoke they'll be wantin' to leave this island just\r\nas quick as they can, without waitin' for the flour to give out.\"\r\n\r\nHere was another pressure brought to bear upon me. Not only the waning\r\nflour, but the rapidly disappearing tobacco money was used as a weapon\r\nto urge me forward to the love-making which Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine\r\nhad set their hearts upon.\r\n\r\nI was in no hurry to leave the island, and hoped very much that when we\r\ndid go we should depart in some craft more comfortable than a ship's\r\nboat. In order, therefore, to prevent any undue desire to leave on the\r\npart of the sailors, I gave them money enough to buy a good many teacups\r\nfull of tobacco. By this act I think I wounded the feelings of Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine, although I had no idea that such would be the\r\neffect of my little gift. They said nothing to me on the subject, but\r\ntheir looks and manners indicated that they thought I had not been\r\nacting honorably. For two days they had very little to say to me, and\r\nthen Mrs. Aleshine came to me to make what, I suppose, was their supreme\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lecks and me is a-goin' to try,\" she said,—and as she spoke she\r\nlooked at me with a very sad expression and a watery appearance about\r\nthe eyes,—\"to stretch out the time for you a little longer. We are\r\ngoin' to make them sailormen eat more fish; and as for me and her, we'll\r\ngo pretty much without bread, and make it up, as well as we can, on\r\nother things. You and Miss Ruth and the parson can each have your three\r\nquarters of a pint of flour a day, just the same as ever, and what we\r\nsave ought to give you three or four days longer.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech moved me deeply. I could not allow these two kind-hearted\r\nwomen to half starve themselves in order that I might have more time to\r\nwoo, and I spoke very earnestly on the subject to Mrs. Aleshine, urging\r\nher to give up the fanciful plans which she and Mrs. Lecks had\r\nconcocted.\r\n\r\n\"Let us drop this idea of love-making,\" I said, \"which is the wildest\r\nkind of vagary, and all live happily together, as we did before. If the\r\nprovisions give out before the Dusantes come back, I suppose we shall\r\nhave to leave in the boat; but, until that time comes, let us enjoy life\r\nhere as much as we can, and be the good friends that we used to be.\"\r\n\r\nI might as well have talked to one of the palm-trees which waved over\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"As I said before,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, \"what is saved from Mrs.\r\nLecks's and mine and the three sailormen's three quarters of a pint\r\napiece ought to give you four days more.\" And she went into the house.\r\n\r\nAll this time the Reverend Mr. Enderton had sat and read in the library,\r\nor meditatively had walked the beach with a book in his hand; while the\r\nthree mariners had caught fish, performed their other work, and lain in\r\nthe shade, smoking their pipes in peace. Miss Ruth and I had taken our\r\ndaily rows and walks, and had enjoyed our usual hours of pleasant\r\nconverse, and all the members of the little colony seemed happy and\r\ncontented except Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine. These two went gravely\r\nand sadly about their work, and the latter asked no more for the\r\nhornpipes and the sea-songs of her sailormen.\r\n\r\nBut, for some unaccountable reason, Mr. Enderton's condition of tranquil\r\nabstraction did not continue. He began to be fretful and discontented.\r\nHe found fault with his food and his accommodations, and instead of\r\nspending the greater part of the day in the library, as had been his\r\nwont, he took to wandering about the island, generally with two or three\r\nbooks under his arm, sometimes sitting down in one place, and sometimes\r\nin another, and then rising suddenly to go grumbling into the house.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, as Miss Ruth and I were in the skiff in the lagoon, we\r\nsaw Mr. Enderton approaching us, walking on the beach. As soon as he was\r\nnear enough for us to hear him, he shouted to his daughter:\r\n\r\n\"Ruth, come out of that boat! If you want to take the air, I should\r\nthink you might as well walk with me as to go rowing round with—with\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\nThis rude and heartless speech made my blood boil, while my companion\r\nturned pale with mortification. The man had never made the slightest\r\nobjection to our friendly intercourse, and this unexpected attack was\r\nentirely indefensible.\r\n\r\n\"Please put me ashore,\" said Miss Ruth, and without a word, for I could\r\nnot trust myself to speak, I landed her; and, petulantly complaining\r\nthat she never gave him one moment of her society, her father led her\r\naway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SMOKING THEIR PIPES IN PEACE.\"]\r\n\r\nAn hour later, my soul still in a state of turmoil, but with the\r\nviolence of its tossings somewhat abated, I entered one of the paths\r\nwhich led through the woods. After a few turns, I reached a point where\r\nI could see for quite a long distance to the other end of the path,\r\nwhich opened out upon the beach. There I perceived Mr. Enderton sitting\r\nupon the little bench on which I had found Emily's book. His back was\r\ntoward me, and he seemed to be busily reading. About midway between him\r\nand myself I saw Miss Ruth slowly walking toward me. Her eyes were fixed\r\nupon the ground, and she had not seen me.\r\n\r\nStepping to one side, I awaited her approach. When she came near I\r\naccosted her.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Ruth,\" said I, \"has your father been talking to you of me?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up quickly, evidently surprised at my being there. \"Yes,\" she\r\nsaid, \"he has told me that it is not—suitable that I should be with you\r\nas much as I have been since we came here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in this remark that roused again the turmoil which\r\nhad begun to subside within me. There was so much that was unjust and\r\ntyrannical, and—what perhaps touched me still deeper—there was such a\r\nwant of consideration and respect in this behavior of Mr. Enderton's,\r\nthat it brought to the front some very incongruous emotions. I had been\r\nsuperciliously pushed aside, and I found I was angry. Something was\r\nabout to be torn from me, and I found I loved it.\r\n\r\n\"Ruth,\" said I, stepping up close to her, \"do you like to be with me as\r\nyou have been?\"\r\n\r\nIf Miss Ruth had not spent such a large portion of her life in the\r\nout-of-the-world village of Nanfouchong, if she had not lived among\r\nthose simple-hearted missionaries, where it was never necessary to\r\nconceal her emotions or her sentiments, if it had not been that she\r\nnever had had emotions or sentiments that it was necessary to conceal, I\r\ndo not believe that when she answered me she would have raised her eyes\r\nto me with a look in them of a deep-blue sky seen through a sort of\r\nIndian-summer mist, and that, gazing thus, she would have said:\r\n\r\n\"Of course I like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us make it suitable,\" I said, taking both her hands in mine.\r\n\r\nThere was another look, in which the skies shone clear and bright, and\r\nthen, in a moment, it was all done.\r\n\r\nAbout five minutes after this I said to her, \"Ruth, shall we go to your\r\nfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" she answered. And together we walked along the thickly\r\nshaded path.\r\n\r\nThe missionary still sat with his back toward us, and, being so intent\r\nupon his book, I found that by keeping my eyes upon him it was perfectly\r\nsafe to walk with my arm around Ruth until we had nearly reached him.\r\nThen I took her hand in mine, and we stepped in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Ruth, \"Mr. Craig and I are going to be married.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something very plump about this remark, and Mr. Enderton\r\nimmediately raised his eyes from his book and fixed them first upon his\r\ndaughter and then upon me; then he let them drop, and through the narrow\r\nspace between us he gazed out over the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Well, father,\" said Ruth, a little impatiently, \"what do you think of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton leaned forward and picked up a leaf from the ground. This\r\nhe placed between the open pages of his book, and closed it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that on many accounts the arrangement you\r\npropose may be an excellent one. Yes,\" he added more decidedly; \"I think\r\nit will do very well indeed. I shall not be at all surprised if we are\r\nobliged to remain on this island for a considerable time, and, for my\r\npart, I have no desire to leave it at present. And when you shall place\r\nyourself, Ruth, in a position in which you will direct the domestic\r\neconomies of the establishment, I hope that you will see to it that\r\nthings generally are made more compatible with comfort and gentility,\r\nand, as regards the table, I may add with palatability.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"IT WAS PERFECTLY SAFE.\"]\r\n\r\nRuth and I looked at each other, and then together we promised that as\r\nfar as in us lay we would try to make the life of Mr. Enderton a happy\r\none, not only while we were on the island, but ever afterward.\r\n\r\nWe were promising a great deal, but at that moment we felt very\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nThen he stood up, shook us both by the hands, and we left him to his\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth and I came walking out of the woods and approached the house,\r\nMrs. Aleshine was standing outside, not far from the kitchen. When she\r\nsaw us she gazed steadily at us for a few moments, a strange expression\r\ncoming over her face. Then she threw up both her hands, and without a\r\nword she turned and rushed indoors.\r\n\r\nWe had not reached the house before Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine came\r\nhurrying out together. Running up to us with a haste and an excitement I\r\nhad never seen in either of them, first one and then the other took Ruth\r\ninto her arms and kissed her with much earnestness. Then they turned\r\nupon me and shook my hands with hearty vigor, expressing, more by their\r\nlooks and actions than their words, a triumphant approbation of what I\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\n\"The minute I laid eyes on you,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"I knowed it was\r\nall right. There wasn't no need of askin' questions.\"\r\n\r\nI now became fearful lest, in the exuberance of their satisfaction,\r\nthese good women might reveal to Ruth the plans they had laid for our\r\nmatrimonial future, and the reluctance I had shown in entering into\r\nthem. My countenance must have expressed my apprehensions, for Mrs.\r\nAleshine, her ruddy face glowing with warmth, both mental and physical,\r\ngave me a little wink, and drew me to one side.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't suppose that we've ever said anything to Miss Ruth, or that\r\nwe're goin' to. It's a great deal better to let her think you did it all\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nI felt like resenting this imputation upon the independence of my\r\nlove-making, but at this happy moment I did not want to enter into a\r\ndiscussion, and therefore merely smiled.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad, I don't know how to tell it,\" continued Mrs. Aleshine, as\r\nMrs. Lecks and Ruth walked toward the house.\r\n\r\nI was about to follow, but my companion detained me.\r\n\r\n\"Have you spoke to the parson?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said I, \"and he seems perfectly satisfied. I am rather\r\nsurprised at this, because of late he has been in such a remarkably bad\r\nhumor.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"there's no gettin' round the fact that\r\nhe's been a good deal crosser than two sticks. You see, Mr. Craig, that\r\nMrs. Lecks and me we made up our minds that it wasn't fair to the\r\nDusantes to let that rich missionary go on payin' nothin' but four\r\ndollars a week apiece for him and his daughter, and if we couldn't get\r\nno more out of him one way, we'd do it another. It was fair enough that\r\nif he didn't pay more he ought to get less; and so we gave him more fish\r\nand not so much bread, the same as we did the sailormen; and we weakened\r\nhis tea, and sent him just so much sugar, and no more; and as for\r\nopenin' boxes of sardines for him, which there was no reason why they\r\nshouldn't be left here for the Dusantes, I just wouldn't do it, though\r\nhe said he'd got all the fresh fish he wanted when he was in China. And\r\nthen we agreed that it was high time that that libr'ry should be cleaned\r\nup, and we went to work at it, not mindin' what he said; for it's no use\r\ntellin' me that four dollars a week will pay for a front room and good\r\nboard, and the use of a libr'ry all day. And as there wasn't no need of\r\nboth of us cleanin' one room, Mrs. Lecks she went into the parlor,\r\nwhere he'd took his books, and begun there. And then, again, we shut\r\ndown on Mr. Dusante's dressing-gown. There was no sense includin' the\r\nuse of that in his four dollars a week, so we brushed it up, and\r\ncamphored it, and put it away. We just wanted to let him know that if he\r\nundertook to be skinflinty, he'd better try it on somebody else besides\r\nus. We could see that he was a good deal upset, for if ever a man liked\r\nto have things quiet and comfortable around him, and everything his own\r\nway, that man is that missionary. But we didn't care if we did prod him\r\nup a little. Mrs. Lecks and me we both agreed that it would do him good.\r\nWhy, he'd got into such a way of shettin' himself up in himself that he\r\ndidn't even see that his daughter was goin' about with a young man, and\r\nfixin' her affections on him more and more every day, when he never had\r\nno idea, as could be proved by witnesses, of marryin' her.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'I KNOWED IT WAS ALL RIGHT.'\"]\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Aleshine,\" said I, looking at her very steadfastly, \"I believe,\r\nafter all, that you and Mrs. Lecks had your own way in regard to\r\nhurrying up this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said she, with happy complacency; \"I shouldn't wonder if we had.\r\nStirrin' up the parson was our last chance, and it wasn't much trouble\r\nto do it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks, whose manner toward me for the last few days had been\r\ncharacterized by cold severity, now resumed her former friendly\r\ndemeanor, although she was not willing to let the affair pass over\r\nwithout some words of reproach.\r\n\r\n\"I must say, Mr. Craig,\" she remarked the next morning, \"that I was\r\ngettin' pretty well outdone with you. I was beginnin' to think that a\r\nyoung man that couldn't see and wouldn't see what was good for him\r\ndidn't deserve to have it; and if Miss Ruth's father had just come down\r\nwith a heavy foot and put an end to the whole business, I'm not sure I'd\r\nbeen sorry for you. But it's all right at last, and bygones is bygones.\r\nAnd now, what we've got to do is to get ready for the weddin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wedding!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks regarded me with an expression in which there was something\r\nof virtuous indignation and something of pity. \"Mr. Craig,\" said she,\r\n\"if there ever was anybody that wanted a guardeen, it's you. Now, just\r\nlet me tell you this. That Mr. Enderton ain't to be trusted no further\r\nthan you can see him, and not so fur, neither, if it can be helped. He's\r\nwillin' for you to have Miss Ruth now, because he's pretty much made up\r\nhis mind that we're goin' to stay here, and as he considers you the\r\nmaster of this island, of course he thinks it'll be for his good for his\r\ndaughter to be mistress of it. For one thing, he wouldn't expect to pay\r\nno board then. But just let him get away from this island, and just let\r\nhim set his eyes on some smooth-faced young fellow that'll agree to take\r\nhim into the concern and keep him for nothin' on books and tea, he'll\r\njust throw you over without winkin'. And Miss Ruth is not the girl to\r\nmarry you against his will, if he opens the Bible and piles texts on\r\nher, which he is capable of doin'. If in any way you two should get\r\nseparated when you leave here, there's no knowin' when you'd ever see\r\neach other again, for where he'll take her nobody can tell. He's more\r\nwillin' to set down and stay where he finds himself comfortable than\r\nanybody I've met yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" I said, \"I'm ready to be married at any moment; but I don't\r\nbelieve Miss Ruth and her father would consent to anything so speedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you get into the way,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"of beforehand believin'\r\nthis or that. It don't pay. Just you go to her father and talk to him\r\nabout it, and if you and him agree, it'll be easy enough to make her\r\nsee the sense of it. You attend to them, and I'll see that everythin' is\r\ngot ready. And you'd better fix the day for to-morrow, for we can't stay\r\nhere much longer, and there's a lot of house-cleanin' and bakin' and\r\ncookin' to be done before we go.\"\r\n\r\nI took this advice, and broached the subject to Mr. Enderton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said he, laying down his book, \"your proposition is\r\ndecidedly odd; I may say, very odd, indeed. But it is, perhaps, after\r\nall, no odder than many things I have seen. Among the various\r\ndenominational sects I have noticed occurrences quite as odd; quite as\r\nodd, sir. For my part, I have no desire to object to an early\r\ncelebration of the matrimonial rites. I may say, indeed, that I am of\r\nthe opinion that a certain amount of celerity in this matter will\r\nconduce to the comfort of all concerned. It has been a very\r\nunsatisfactory thing to me to see my daughter occupying a subordinate\r\nposition in our little family, where she has not even the power to turn\r\nhousehold affairs into the channels of my comfort. To-morrow, I think,\r\nwill do very well indeed. Even if it should rain, I see no reason why\r\nthe ceremony should be postponed.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition of a wedding on the morrow was not received by Ruth with\r\nfavor. She was unprepared for such precipitancy. But she finally yielded\r\nto arguments; not so much to mine, I fear, as to those offered by Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of that day the three mariners were kept very busy,\r\nbringing in green things to deck the parlor, and doing every imaginable\r\nkind of work necessary to a wedding which Mrs. Aleshine was willing to\r\ngive into their hands. As for herself and her good friend, they put\r\nthemselves upon their mettle as providers of festivals. They made cakes,\r\npies, and I never knew half so well as the three sailors how many other\r\nkinds of good things. Besides all this, they assisted Ruth to array\r\nherself in some degree in a manner becoming a bride. Some light and\r\npretty adornments of dress were borrowed from Emily or Lucille, they\r\nknew not which, and, after having been \"done up\" and fluted and crimped\r\nby Mrs. Lecks, were incorporated by Ruth into her costume with so much\r\ntaste that on the wedding morning she appeared to me to be dressed more\r\ncharmingly than any bride I had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe three sailors had done their own washing and ironing, and appeared\r\nin cleanly garb, and with hair and beards well wet and brushed. Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine put on their best bibs and tuckers, and Mr.\r\nEnderton assumed his most clerical air as he stood behind a table in the\r\nparlor and married Ruth and me.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Mr. Enderton, as we were seated at the wedding-feast, \"is a\r\nmost creditable display of attractive viands, but I may say, my dear\r\nRuth, that I think I perceived the influence of the happy event of\r\nto-day even before it took place. I have lately had a better appetite\r\nfor my food, and have experienced a greater enjoyment of my\r\nsurroundings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" murmured Mrs. Aleshine in my ear, \"for we'd no\r\nsooner knowed that you two were to make a match of it than we put an\r\nextry spoonful of tea into his pot, and stopped scrubbin' the libr'ry.\"\r\n\r\nFor the next two days all was bustle and work on the island. Mrs. Lecks\r\nand Mrs. Aleshine would not consent to depart without leaving everything\r\nin the best possible order, so that the Dusantes might not be\r\ndissatisfied with the condition of their house when they returned. It\r\nwas, in fact, the evident desire of the two women to gratify their pride\r\nin their house-wifely abilities by leaving everything better than they\r\nfound it.\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton was much surprised at these preparations for immediate\r\ndeparture. He was very well satisfied with his life on the island, and\r\nhad prepared his mind for an indefinite continuance of it, with the\r\nposition of that annoying and obdurate Mrs. Lecks filled by a compliant\r\nand affectionate daughter. He had no reasonable cause for complaint, for\r\nthe whole subject of the exhaustion of our supply of provisions, and the\r\nnecessity of an open-boat trip to an inhabited island, had been fully\r\ndiscussed before him; but he was so entirely engrossed in the\r\nconsideration of his own well-being that this discussion of our plans\r\nhad made no impression upon him. He now became convinced that a\r\nconspiracy had been entered into against him, and fell into an\r\nunpleasant humor. This, however, produced very little effect upon any of\r\nus, for we were all too busy to notice his whims. But his sudden change\r\nof disposition made me understand how correct were the opinions of Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine concerning him. If I had left that island\r\nwith my marriage with Ruth depending upon Mr. Enderton's coöperation, my\r\nprospects of future happiness would have been at the mercy of his\r\ncaprices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEY ASSISTED RUTH TO ARRAY HERSELF.\"]\r\n\r\nVery early on a beautiful morning Ruth and I started out on our wedding\r\njourney in the long-boat. Mr. Enderton was made as comfortable as\r\npossible in the stern, with Ruth near him. Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine\r\nsat facing each other, each with a brown-paper package by her side,\r\ncontaining the life-preserver on which she had arrived. These were to be\r\never cherished as memorials of a wonderful experience. The three sailors\r\nand I took turns at the oars. The sea was smooth, and there was every\r\nreason to believe that we should arrive at our destination before the\r\nend of the day. Mrs. Aleshine had supplied us with an abundance of\r\nprovisions, and, with the exception of Mr. Enderton, who had not been\r\npermitted to take away any of the Dusante books, we were a contented\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"As long as the flour held out,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, \"I'd never been\r\nwillin' to leave that island till the Dusantes came back, and we could\r\nhave took Emily or Lucille, whichever it was that kept house, and showed\r\nher everythin', and told her just what we had done. But when they do\r\ncome back,\" she added, \"and read that letter which Mr. Craig wrote and\r\nleft for them, and find out all that happened in their country-place\r\nwhile they was away; and how two of us was made happy for life; and how\r\ntwo more of us, meanin' Mrs. Lecks and me, have give up goin' to Japan,\r\nintendin', instid of that, writin' to my son to come home to America and\r\nsettle down in the country he ought to live in,—why, then, if them\r\nDusantes ain't satisfied, it's no use for anybody to ever try to satisfy\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think not,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"with the weddin'-cards on the\r\nparlor table, not a speck of dust in any corner, and the board money in\r\nthe ginger-jar.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the little party, consisting of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, Mr.\r\nEnderton, my newly made wife, and myself, with the red-bearded coxswain\r\nand the two sailormen, bade farewell to that island in the Pacific where\r\nso many happy hours had been passed, where such pleasant friendships had\r\nbeen formed, and where I had met my Ruth and made her my wife, we rowed\r\naway with a bright sky over our heads, a pleasant wind behind us, and a\r\nsmooth sea beneath us. The long-boat was comfortable and well appointed,\r\nand there was even room enough in it for Mr. Enderton to stretch himself\r\nout and take a noonday nap. We gave him every advantage of this kind,\r\nfor we had found by experience that our party was happiest when my\r\nfather-in-law was best contented.\r\n\r\nEarly in the forenoon the coxswain rigged a small sail in the bow of the\r\nboat, and with this aid to our steady and systematic work at the oars\r\nwe reached, just before nightfall, the large island whither we were\r\nbound, and to which, by means of the coxswain's pocket-compass, we had\r\nsteered a direct course. Our arrival on this island, which was inhabited\r\nby some white traders and a moderate population of natives, occasioned\r\ngreat surprise; for when the boats containing the crew and passengers of\r\nour unfortunate steamer had reached the island, it was found that Mrs.\r\nLecks, Mrs. Aleshine, and myself were missing. There were many\r\nsuppositions as to our fate. Some persons thought we had been afraid to\r\nleave the steamer, and, having secreted ourselves on board, had gone\r\ndown with her. Others conjectured that in the darkness we had fallen\r\noverboard, either from the steamer or from one of the boats; and there\r\nwas even a surmise that we might have embarked in the leaky small\r\nboat—in which we really did leave the steamer—and so had been lost. At\r\nany rate, we had disappeared, and our loss was a good deal talked about\r\nand, in a manner, mourned. In less than a week after their arrival the\r\npeople from the steamer had been taken on board a sailing-vessel and\r\ncarried westward to their destination.\r\n\r\nWe, however, were not so fortunate, for we remained on this island for\r\nmore than a month. During this time but one ship touched there, and she\r\nwas western bound and of no use to us, for we had determined to return\r\nto America. Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine had given up their journey to\r\nJapan, and were anxious to reach once more their country homes, while my\r\ndear Ruth and I were filled with a desire to found a home on some\r\npleasant portion of the Atlantic seaboard. What Mr. Enderton intended to\r\ndo we did not know. He was on his way to the United States when he left\r\nthe leaking ship on which he and his daughter were passengers, and his\r\nintentions regarding his journey did not appear to have been altered by\r\nhis mishaps.\r\n\r\nBy the western-bound vessel, however, Mrs. Aleshine sent a letter to her\r\nson.\r\n\r\nOur life on this island was monotonous and to the majority of the party\r\nuninteresting; but as it was the scene of our honeymoon, Mrs. Craig and\r\nI will always look back to it with the most pleasurable recollections.\r\nWe were comfortably lodged in a house belonging to one of the traders,\r\nand although Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine had no household duties to\r\noccupy their time, they managed to supply themselves with\r\nknitting-materials from the stores on the island, and filled up their\r\nhours of waiting with chatty industry. The pipes of our sailor friends\r\nwere always well filled, while the sands of the island were warm and\r\npleasant for their backs, and it was only Mr. Enderton who showed any\r\nsigns of impatient repining at our enforced stay. He growled, he\r\ngrumbled, and he inveighed against the criminal neglect of steamship\r\ncompanies and the owners of sailing-craft in not making it compulsory in\r\nevery one of their vessels to stop on every voyage at this island,\r\nwhere, at any time, intelligent and important personages might be\r\nstranded.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, we were taken off by a three-masted schooner bound for\r\nSan Francisco, at which city we arrived in due time and in good health\r\nand condition.\r\n\r\nWe did not remain long in this city, but soon started on our way across\r\nthe continent, leaving behind us our three sailor companions, who\r\nintended to ship from this port as soon as an advantageous opportunity\r\noffered itself. These men heard no news of their vessel, although they\r\nfelt quite sure that she had reached Honolulu, where she had probably\r\nbeen condemned and the crew scattered. As some baggage belonging to my\r\nwife and my father-in-law had been left on board this vessel, I had\r\nhopes that Mr. Enderton would remain in San Francisco and order it\r\nforwarded to him there; or that he would even take a trip to Honolulu to\r\nattend to the matter personally. But in this I was disappointed. He\r\nseemed to take very little interest in his missing trunks, and wished\r\nonly to press on to the East. I wrote to Honolulu, desiring the\r\nnecessary steps to be taken to forward the baggage in case it had\r\narrived there; and soon afterward our party of five started eastward.\r\n\r\nIt was now autumn, but, although we desired to reach the end of our\r\njourney before winter set in, we felt that we had time enough to visit\r\nsome of the natural wonders of the California country before taking up\r\nour direct course to the East. Therefore, in spite of some petulant\r\nremonstrances on the part of Mr. Enderton, we made several trips to\r\npoints of interest.\r\n\r\nFrom the last of these excursions we set out in a stage-coach, of which\r\nwe were the only occupants, toward a point on the railroad where we\r\nexpected to take a train. On the way we stopped to change horses at a\r\nsmall stage-station at the foot of a range of mountains; and when I\r\ndescended from the coach I found the driver and some of the men at the\r\nstation discussing the subject of our route. It appeared that there were\r\ntwo roads, one of which gradually ascended the mountain for several\r\nmiles, and then descended to the level of the railroad, by the side of\r\nwhich it ran until it reached the station where we wished to take the\r\ntrain. The other road pursued its way along a valley or notch in the\r\nmountain for a considerable distance, and then, by a short but somewhat\r\nsteep ascending grade, joined the upper road.\r\n\r\nIt was growing quite cold, and the sky and the wind indicated that bad\r\nweather might be expected; and as the upper road was considered the\r\nbetter one at such a time, our driver concluded to take it. Six horses,\r\ninstead of four, were now attached to our stage; and as two of these\r\nanimals were young and unruly, and promised to be unusually difficult to\r\ndrive in the ordinary way, our driver concluded to ride one of the\r\nwheel-horses, postilion fashion, and to put a boy on one of the leaders.\r\nMr. Enderton was very much afraid of horses, and objected strongly to\r\nthe young animals in our new team. But there were no others to take\r\ntheir places, and his protests were disregarded.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I occupied a back seat, having been ordered to take this\r\ncomfortable position by Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, who had\r\nconstituted themselves a board of instruction and admonition to Mrs.\r\nCraig, and incidentally to myself. They fancied that my wife's health\r\nwas not vigorous, and that she needed coddling, and if she had had two\r\nmothers she could not have been more tenderly cared for than by these\r\ngood women. They sat upon the middle seat with their faces toward the\r\nhorses, while Mr. Enderton had the front seat all to himself. He was,\r\nhowever, so nervous and fidgety, continually twisting himself about\r\nendeavoring to get a view of the horses or of the bad places on the\r\nroad, that Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine found that a position facing him\r\nand in close juxtaposition was entirely too uncomfortable; and\r\nconsequently, the back of their seat being adjustable, they turned\r\nthemselves about and faced us.\r\n\r\nThe ascent of the mountain was slow and tedious, and it was late in the\r\nafternoon when we reached the highest point in our route, from which the\r\nroad descended for some eight miles to the level of the railroad. Now\r\nour pace became rapid, and Mr. Enderton grew wildly excited. He threw\r\nopen the window, and shouted to the driver to go more slowly; but Mrs.\r\nLecks seized him by the coat and jerked him back on his seat before he\r\ncould get any answer to his appeals.\r\n\r\n\"If you want your daughter to ketch her death o' cold you'll keep that\r\nwindow open!\" As she said this, she leaned back and pulled the window\r\ndown with her own strong right arm. \"I guess the driver knows what he is\r\nabout,\" she continued, \"this not bein' the first time he's gone over the\r\nroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to understand, madam,\" said Mr. Enderton, \"that I am not to speak\r\nto my driver when I wish him to know my will?\"\r\n\r\nTo this question Mrs. Lecks made no answer, but sat up very straight and\r\nstiff, with her back square upon the speaker. For some time she and Mr.\r\nEnderton had been \"out,\" and she made no effort to conceal the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton's condition now became pitiable, for our rapid speed and\r\nthe bumping over rough places in the road seemed almost to deprive him\r\nof his wits, notwithstanding my assurance that stage-coaches were\r\ngenerally driven at a rapid rate down long inclines. In a short time,\r\nhowever, we reached a level spot in the road, and the team was drawn up\r\nand stopped. Mr. Enderton popped out in a moment, and I also got down to\r\nhave a talk with the driver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE ASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS SLOW AND TEDIOUS.\"]\r\n\r\n\"These hosses won't do much at holdin' back,\" he said, \"and it worries\r\n'em less to let 'em go ahead with the wheels locked. You needn't be\r\nafraid. If nothin' breaks, we're all right.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton seemed endeavoring to satisfy himself that everything about\r\nthe running-gear of the coach was in a safe condition. He examined the\r\nwheels, the axles, and the whiffletrees, much to the amusement of the\r\ndriver, who remarked to me that the old chap probably knew as much now\r\nas he did before. I was rather surprised that my father-in-law subjected\r\nthe driver to no further condemnation. On the contrary, he said nothing\r\nexcept that for the rest of this downhill drive he should take his place\r\non the driver's unoccupied seat. Nobody offered any objection to this,\r\nand up he climbed.\r\n\r\nWhen we started again, Ruth seemed disturbed that her father should be\r\nin such an exposed position, but I assured her that he would be\r\nperfectly safe, and would be much better satisfied at being able to see\r\nfor himself what was going on.\r\n\r\nWe now began to go downhill again at a rate as rapid as before. Our\r\nspeed, however, was not equal. Sometimes it would slacken a little where\r\nthe road was heavy or more upon a level, and then we would go jolting\r\nand rattling over some long downward stretch. After a particularly\r\nunpleasant descent of this kind the coach seemed suddenly to change its\r\ndirection, and with a twist and an uplifting of one side it bumped\r\nheavily against something, and stopped. I heard a great shout outside,\r\nand from a window which now commanded a view of the road I saw our team\r\nof six horses, with the drivers pulling and tugging at the two they\r\nrode, madly running away at the top of their speed.\r\n\r\nRuth, who had been thrown by the shock into the arms of Mrs. Aleshine,\r\nwas dreadfully frightened, and screamed for her father. I had been\r\npitched forward upon Mrs. Lecks, but I quickly recovered myself, and as\r\nsoon as I found that none of the occupants of the coach had been hurt, I\r\nopened the door and sprang out.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the road stood Mr. Enderton, entirely uninjured, with a\r\njubilant expression on his face, and in one hand a large closed\r\numbrella.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" I exclaimed, hurrying around to the front of the\r\ncoach, where I saw that the pole had been broken off about the middle of\r\nits length.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has happened, sir,\" replied Mr. Enderton. \"You cannot speak of\r\na wise and discreet act, determinately performed, as a thing which has\r\nhappened. We have been saved, sir, from being dashed to pieces behind\r\nthat wild and unmanageable team of horses; and I will add that we have\r\nbeen saved by my forethought and prompt action.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'WHAT HAS HAPPENED?' I EXCLAIMED.\"]\r\n\r\nI turned and looked at him in astonishment. \"What do you mean?\" I said.\r\n\"What could you have had to do with this accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to repeat,\" said Mr. Enderton, \"that it was not an accident.\r\nThe moment that we began to go downhill I perceived that we were in a\r\nposition of the greatest danger. The driver was reckless, the boy\r\nincompetent, and the horses unmanageable. As my remonstrances and\r\ncounsels had no effect upon the man, and as you seemed to have no desire\r\nto join me in efforts to restrain him to a more prudent rate of speed, I\r\ndetermined to take the affair into my own hands. I knew that the first\r\nthing to be done was to rid ourselves of those horses. So long as we\r\nwere connected with them disaster was imminent. I knew exactly what\r\nought to be done. The horses must be detached from the coach. I had\r\nread, sir, of inventions especially intended to detach runaway horses\r\nfrom a vehicle. To all intents and purposes our horses were runaways, or\r\nwould have become so in a very short time. I now made it my object to\r\nfree ourselves from those horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" I exclaimed. \"You freed us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he answered; \"I did. I got out at our first stop, and\r\nthoroughly examined the carriage attachments. I found that the movable\r\nbar to which the whiffletrees were attached was connected to the vehicle\r\nby two straps and a bolt, the latter having a ring at the top and an\r\niron nut at the bottom. While you and that reckless driver were talking\r\ntogether, and paying no attention to me, the only person in the party\r\nwho thoroughly comprehended our danger, I unbuckled those straps, and\r\nwith my strong, nervous fingers, without the aid of implements, I\r\nunscrewed the nut from the bolt. Then, sir, I took my seat on the\r\noutside of the coach, and felt that I held our safety in my own hands.\r\nFor a time I allowed our vehicle to proceed; but when we approached\r\nthis long slope which stretches before us, and our horses showed signs\r\nof increasing impetuosity, I leaned forward, hooked the handle of my\r\numbrella in the ring of the bolt, and with a mighty effort jerked it\r\nout. I admit to you, sir, that I had overlooked the fact that the horses\r\nwere also attached to the end of the pole, but I have often noticed that\r\nwhen we are discreet in judgment and prompt in action we are also\r\nfortunate. Thus was I fortunate. The hindermost horses, suddenly\r\nreleased, rushed upon those in front of them, and, in a manner, jumbled\r\nup the whole team, which seemed to throw the animals into such terror\r\nthat they dashed to one side and snapped off the pole, after which they\r\nwent madly tearing down the road, entirely beyond the control of the two\r\nriders. Our coach turned and ran into the side of the road with but a\r\nmoderate concussion, and as I looked at those flying steeds, with their\r\nriders vainly endeavoring to restrain them, I could not, sir, keep down\r\nan emotion of pride that I had been instrumental in freeing myself, my\r\ndaughter, and my traveling companions from their dangerous proximity.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker ceased, a smile of conscious merit upon his face. For the\r\nmoment I could not say a word to him, I was so angry. But had I been\r\nable to say or do anything to indicate the wild indignation that filled\r\nmy brain, I should have had no opportunity, for Mrs. Lecks stepped up to\r\nme and took me by the arm. Her face was very stern, and her expression\r\ngave one the idea of the rigidity of Bessemer steel.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard what has been said,\" she remarked, \"and I wish to talk to\r\nthis man. Your wife is over there with Mrs. Aleshine. Will you please\r\ntake a walk with her along the road? You may stay away for a quarter of\r\nan hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Mr. Enderton, \"I do not wish to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't ask you whether you did or not,\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"Mr. Craig,\r\nwill you please get your wife away as quick and as far as you can?\"\r\n\r\nI took the hint, and, with Ruth on my arm, walked rapidly down the road.\r\nShe was very glad to go, for she had been much frightened, and wanted to\r\nbe alone with me to have me explain to her what had occurred. Mrs.\r\nLecks, imagining from the expression of his countenance that Mr.\r\nEnderton had, in some way, been at the bottom of the trouble, and\r\nfearing that she should not be able to restrain her indignation when she\r\nfound how he had done it, had ordered Mrs. Aleshine to keep Ruth away\r\nfrom her father. This action had increased the poor girl's anxiety, and\r\nshe was glad enough to have me take her away and tell her all about our\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nI did tell her all that had happened, speaking as mildly as I could of\r\nMr. Enderton's conduct. Poor Ruth burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"I do wish,\" she exclaimed, \"that father would travel by himself! He is\r\nso nervous, and so easily frightened, that I am sure he would be happier\r\nwhen he could attend to his safety in his own way; and I know, too, that\r\nwe should be happier without him.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed most heartily with these sentiments, although I did not deem it\r\nnecessary to say so, and Ruth now asked me what I supposed would become\r\nof us.\r\n\r\n\"If nothing happens to the driver and the boy,\" I replied, \"I suppose\r\nthey will go on until they get to the station to which we were bound,\r\nand there they will procure a pole, if such a thing can be found, or,\r\nperhaps, get another coach, and come back for us. It would be useless\r\nfor them to return to our coach in its present condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how soon do you think they will come back?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Not for some hours,\" I replied. \"The driver told me there were no\r\nhouses between the place where we last stopped and the railroad-station,\r\nand I am sure he will not turn back until he reaches a place where he\r\ncan get either a new pole or another vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nRuth and I walked to a turn at the bottom of the long hill down which\r\nour runaway steeds had sped. At this point we had an extended view of\r\nthe road as it wound along the mountain-side, but we could see no signs\r\nof our horses, nor of any living thing. I did not, in fact, expect to\r\nsee our team, for it would be foolish in the driver to come back until\r\nhe was prepared to do something for us, and even if he had succeeded in\r\ncontrolling the runaway beasts, the quicker he got down the mountain the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had returned we had taken quite a long walk, but we were\r\nglad of it, for the exercise tranquilized us both. On our way back we\r\nnoticed that a road which seemed to come up from below us joined the one\r\nwe were on a short distance from the place where our accident occurred.\r\nThis, probably, was the lower road which had been spoken of when we\r\nchanged horses.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr. Enderton standing by himself. His face was of the hue of\r\nwood-ashes, his expression haggard. He reminded me of a man who had\r\nfallen from a considerable height, and who had been frightened and\r\nstupefied by the shock. I comprehended the situation without difficulty,\r\nand felt quite sure that had he had the choice he would have much\r\npreferred a thrashing to the plain talk he had heard from Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, father?\" exclaimed Ruth. \"Were you hurt?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton looked in a dazed way at his daughter, and it was some\r\nmoments before he appeared to have heard what she said. Then he answered\r\nabruptly: \"Hurt? Oh, no! I am not hurt in the least. I was just thinking\r\nof something. I shall walk on to the village or town, whichever it is,\r\nto which that man was taking us. It cannot be more than seven or eight\r\nmiles away, if that. The road is downhill, and I can easily reach the\r\nplace before nightfall. I will then personally attend to your rescue,\r\nand will see that a vehicle is immediately sent to you. There is no\r\ntrusting these ignorant drivers. No,\" he continued, deprecatingly\r\nraising his hand; \"do not attempt to dissuade me. Your safety and that\r\nof others is always my first care. Exertion is nothing.\"\r\n\r\nWithout further words, and paying no attention to the remonstrances of\r\nhis daughter, he strode off down the road.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see him go. At any time his presence was undesirable\r\nto me, and under the present circumstances it would be more\r\nobjectionable than ever. He was a good walker, and there was no doubt he\r\nwould easily reach the station, where he might possibly be of some use\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks was sitting on a stone by the roadside. Her face was still\r\nstern and rigid, but there was an expression of satisfaction upon it\r\nwhich had not been there when I left her. Ruth went to the coach to get\r\na shawl, and I said to Mrs. Lecks:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you had your talk with Mr. Enderton?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MRS. LECKS WAS SITTING ON A STONE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Talk!\" she replied. \"I should say so! If ever a man understands what\r\npeople think of him, and knows what he is, from his crown to his feet,\r\ninside and outside, soul, body, bones, and skin, and what he may expect\r\nin this world and the next, he knows it. I didn't keep to what he has\r\ndone for us this day. I went back to the first moment when he began to\r\ngrowl at payin' his honest board on the island, and I didn't let him\r\noff for a single sin that he has committed since. And now I feel that\r\nI've done my duty as far as he is concerned; and havin' got through with\r\nthat, it's time we were lookin' about to see what we can do for\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed time, for the day was drawing toward its close. For a\r\nmoment I had thought we would give Mr. Enderton a good start, and then\r\nfollow him down the mountain to the station. But a little reflection\r\nshowed me that this plan would not answer. Ruth was not strong enough to\r\nwalk so far, and although Mrs. Aleshine had plenty of vigor, she was too\r\nplump to attempt such a tramp. Besides, the sky was so heavily overcast\r\nthat it was not safe to leave the shelter of the coach.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine took immediate\r\ncharge of the personal comfort of the party, and the first thing they\r\ndid was to make preparations for a meal. Fortunately, we had plenty of\r\nprovisions. Mrs. Aleshine had had charge of what she called our\r\nlunch-baskets,—which were, indeed, much more like market-baskets than\r\nanything else,—and having small faith in the resources of roadside\r\ntaverns, and great faith in the unlimited capabilities of Mr. Enderton\r\nin the matter of consuming food on a journey, she had provided\r\nbounteously and even extravagantly.\r\n\r\nOne side of the road was bordered by a forest, and on the ground was an\r\nabundance of dead wood. I gathered a quantity of this, and made a fire,\r\nwhich was very grateful to us, for the air was growing colder and\r\ncolder. When we had eaten a substantial supper and had thoroughly\r\nwarmed ourselves at the fire, we got into the coach to sit there and\r\nwait until relief should come. We sat for a long time—all night, in\r\nfact. We were not uncomfortable, for we each had a corner of the coach,\r\nand we were plentifully provided with wraps and rugs.\r\n\r\nContrary to their usual habit, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine did not talk\r\nmuch. When subjected to the annoyances of an ordinary accident, even if\r\nit should have been the result of carelessness, their disposition would\r\nhave prompted them to take events as they came, and to make the best of\r\nwhatever might happen to them. But this case was entirely different. We\r\nwere stranded and abandoned on the road, on the side of a lonely,\r\ndesolate mountain, on a cold, bleak night; and all this was the result\r\nof what they considered the deliberate and fiendish act of a man who was\r\nafraid of horses, and who cared for no one in the world but himself.\r\nTheir minds were in such a condition that if they said anything they\r\nmust vituperate, and they were so kindly disposed toward my wife, and\r\nhad such a tender regard for her feelings, that they would not, in her\r\npresence, vituperate her father. So they said very little, and, nestling\r\ninto their corners, were soon asleep.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Ruth followed their example, and, though I was very\r\nanxiously watching out of the window for an approaching light, and\r\nlistening for the sound of wheels, I, too, fell into a doze. It must\r\nhave been ten or eleven o'clock when I was awakened by some delicate but\r\ncold touches on my face, the nature of which, when I first opened my\r\neyes, I could not comprehend. But I soon understood what these cold\r\ntouches meant. The window in the door of the coach on my side had been\r\nslightly lowered from the top to give us air, and through the narrow\r\naperture the cold particles had come floating in. I looked through the\r\nwindow. The night was not very dark, for, although the sky was overcast,\r\nthe moon was in its second quarter, and I could plainly see that it was\r\nsnowing, and that the ground was already white.\r\n\r\nThis discovery sent a chill into my soul, for I was not unfamiliar with\r\nsnows in mountain regions, and knew well what this might mean to us. But\r\nthere was nothing that we could now do, and it would be useless and\r\nfoolish to awaken my companions and distress them with this new\r\ndisaster. Besides, I thought our situation might not be so very bad,\r\nafter all. It was not yet winter, and the snowfall might prove to be but\r\na light one. I gently closed the window, and made my body comfortable in\r\nits corner; but my mind continued very uncomfortable for I do not know\r\nhow long.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke I found that there had been a heavy fall of snow in the\r\nnight, and that the flakes were still coming down thick and fast. When\r\nRuth first looked out upon the scene she was startled and dismayed. She\r\nwas not accustomed to storms of this kind, and the snow frightened her.\r\nUpon Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine the sight of the storm produced an\r\nentirely different effect. Here was a difficulty, a discomfort, a\r\nhardship; but it came in a natural way, and not by the hand of a\r\ndastardly coward of a man. With natural-happening difficulties they were\r\naccustomed to combat without fear or repining. They knew all about\r\nsnow, and were not frightened by this storm. The difficulties which it\r\npresented to their minds actually raised their spirits, and from the\r\ngrim and quiet beings of the last evening they became the same cheerful,\r\ndauntless, ready women that I had known before.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, as she clapped her face to a\r\nwindow of the coach, \"if this isn't a reg'lar old-fashioned snow-storm!\r\nI've shoveled my own way through many a one like it to git to the barn\r\nto do my milkin' afore the men-folks had begun makin' paths, and I feel\r\njus' like as though I could do it ag'in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"if you're thinkin' of\r\nshovelin' your way from this place to where your cows is, you'd better\r\nstep right out and get at it, and I really do think that if you felt\r\nthey were sufferin' for want of milkin' you'd make a start.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say,\" answered Mrs. Aleshine, with an illuminating grin, \"that\r\nif the case was that way I mightn't have the hankerin', though not the\r\ncapableness; but I don't know that there's any place to shovel our way\r\nto, jus' now.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks and I thought differently. Across the road, under the great\r\ntrees, the ground was comparatively free from snow, and in some places,\r\nowing to the heavy evergreen foliage, it was entirely bare. It was very\r\ndesirable that we should get to one of these spots and build a fire,\r\nfor, though we had been well wrapped up, we all felt numbed and cold. In\r\nthe boot at the back of the coach I knew that there was an ax, and I\r\nthought I might possibly find there a shovel. I opened the coach door,\r\nand saw that the snow was already above the lower step. By standing on\r\nthe spokes of the back wheel I could easily get at the boot, and I soon\r\npulled out the ax, but found no shovel. But this did not deter me. I\r\nmade my way to the front wheel, and climbed up to the driver's box,\r\nwhere I knocked off one of the thin planks of the foot-board, and this,\r\nwith the ax, I shaped into a rude shovel, with a handle rather too wide,\r\nbut serviceable. With this I went vigorously to work, and soon had made\r\na pathway across the road. Here I chopped off some low dead branches,\r\npicked up others, and soon had a crackling fire, around which my three\r\ncompanions gathered with delight.\r\n\r\nA strong wind was now blowing, and the snow began to form into heavy\r\ndrifts. The fire was very cheery and pleasant, but the wind was cutting,\r\nand we soon returned to the shelter of the coach, where we had our\r\nbreakfast. This was not altogether a cold meal, for Mrs. Aleshine had\r\nprovided a little tea-kettle, and, with some snow-water which I brought\r\nin boiling from the fire in the woods, we had all the hot and comforting\r\ntea we wanted.\r\n\r\nWe passed the morning waiting and looking out, and wondering what sort\r\nof conveyance would be sent for us. It was generally agreed that nothing\r\non wheels could now be got over the road, and that we must be taken away\r\nin a sleigh.\r\n\r\n\"I like sleigh-ridin',\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"if you're well wrapped up,\r\nwith good hosses, and a hot brick for your feet; but I must say I don't\r\nknow but what I'm goin' to be a little skeery goin' down these long\r\nhills. If we git fairly slidin', hosses, sleigh, and all together,\r\nthere's no knowin' where we'll fetch up.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I SOON HAD A CRACKLING FIRE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"There's one comfort, Barb'ry,\" remarked Mrs. Lecks, \"and that is that\r\nwhen we do fetch up it'll be at the bottom of the hills, and not at the\r\ntop; and as the bottom is what we want to get to, we oughtn't to\r\ncomplain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends a good deal whether we come down hind part foremost, or\r\nfore part front. But nobody's complainin' so fur, 'specially as the\r\nsleigh isn't here.\"\r\n\r\nI joined in the outlooking and the conjectures, but I could not keep up\r\nthe cheerful courage which animated my companions; for not only were the\r\ntwo elder women bright and cheery, but Ruth seemed to be animated and\r\nencouraged by their example, and showed herself as brave and contented\r\nas either of them. She was convinced that her father must have reached\r\nthe railroad-station before it began to snow, and therefore she was\r\ntroubled by no fears for his safety. But my mind was filled with many\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nThe snow was still coming down thick and fast, and the wind was piling\r\nit into great drifts, one of which was forming between the coach and a\r\nlow embankment on that side of the road near which it stood.\r\n\r\nAbout every half-hour I took my shovel and cleared out the path across\r\nthe road from the other side of the coach to the woods. Several times\r\nafter doing this I made my way among the trees, where the snow did not\r\nimpede my progress, to points from which I had a view some distance down\r\nthe mountain; and I could plainly see that there were several places\r\nwhere the road was blocked up by huge snow-drifts. It would be a slow,\r\nlaborious, and difficult undertaking for any relief-party to come to us\r\nfrom the station; and who was there at that place to come? This was the\r\nquestion which most troubled me. The settlement at the station was\r\nprobably a very small one, and that there should be found at that place\r\na sleigh or a sled with enough men to form a party sufficiently strong\r\nto open a road up the mountain-side was scarcely to be expected. Men and\r\nvehicles might be obtained at some point farther along the railroad, but\r\naction of this kind would require time, and it was not unlikely that the\r\nrailroad itself was blocked up with snow. I could form no idea\r\nsatisfactory to myself of any plan by which relief could come to us that\r\nday. Even the advent of a messenger on horseback was not to be expected.\r\nSuch an adventurer would be lost in the storm and among the drifts. On\r\nthe morrow relief might come, but I did not like to think too much about\r\nthe morrow; and of any of my thoughts and fears I said nothing to my\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nAt intervals, after I had freshly cleared out the pathway, the three\r\nwomen, well bundled up, ran across the road to the fire under the trees.\r\nThis was the only way in which they could keep themselves warm, for the\r\ncoach, although it protected us from the storm, was a very cold place to\r\nsit in. But the wind and the snow which frequently drove in under the\r\ntrees made it impossible to stay very long by the fire, and the frequent\r\npassages to and from the coach were attended with much exposure and\r\nwetting of feet. I therefore determined that some better way must be\r\ndevised for keeping ourselves warm; and, shortly after our noonday meal,\r\nI thought of a plan, and immediately set to work to carry it out.\r\n\r\nThe drift between the coach and the embankment had now risen higher than\r\nthe top of the vehicle, against one side of which it was tightly packed.\r\nI dug a path around the back of the coach, and then began to tunnel into\r\nthe huge bank of snow. In about an hour I had made an excavation nearly\r\nhigh enough for me to stand in, and close to the stage door on that\r\nside; and I cleared away the snow so that this door could open into the\r\ncavern I had formed. At the end opposite the entrance of my cave, I\r\nworked a hole upward until I reached the outer air. This hole was, about\r\na foot in diameter, and for some time the light, unpacked snow from\r\nabove kept falling and filling it up; but I managed, by packing and\r\nbeating the sides with my shovel, to get the whole into a condition in\r\nwhich it would retain the form of a rude chimney.\r\n\r\nNow I hurried to bring wood and twigs, and having made a hearth of green\r\nsticks, which I cut with my ax, I built a fire in this snowy fireplace.\r\nMrs. Lecks, Mrs. Aleshine, and Ruth had been watching my proceedings\r\nwith great interest; and when the fire began to burn, and the smoke to\r\ngo out of my chimney, the coach door was opened, and the genial heat\r\ngradually pervaded the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, \"if that isn't one of the\r\nbrightest ideas I ever heard of! A fire in the middle of a snowbank,\r\nwith a man there attendin' to it, an' a chimney! 'T isn't every day that\r\nyou can see a thing like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope not,\" remarked Mrs. Lecks, \"for if the snow drifted this\r\nway every day, I'd be ready to give up the seein' business out and out!\r\nBut I think, Mr. Craig, you ought to pass that shovel in to us so that\r\nwe can dig you out when the fire begins to melt your little house and it\r\nall caves in on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have the shovel,\" said I, \"but I don't believe this snowbank\r\nwill cave in on me. Of course the heat will melt the snow, but I think\r\nit will dissolve gradually, so that the caving in, if there is any,\r\nwon't be of much account, and then we shall have a big open space here\r\nin which we can keep up our fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Ruth, \"you talk as if you expected to stay here\r\never so long, and we certainly can't do that. We should starve to death,\r\nfor one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid of that,\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"There's plenty of\r\nvictuals to last till the people come for us. When I pack baskets for\r\ntravelin' or picnickin', I don't do no scrimpin'. An' we've got to keep\r\nup a fire, you know, for it wouldn't be pleasant for those men, when\r\nthey've cut a way up the mountain to git at us, to find us all froze\r\nstiff.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks smiled. \"You're awful tender of the feelin's of other people,\r\nBarb'ry,\" she said, \"and a heart as warm as yourn ought to keep from\r\nfreezin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which it has done, so far,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, complacently.\r\n\r\nAs I had expected, the water soon began to drip from the top and the\r\nsides of my cavern, and the chimney rapidly enlarged its dimensions. I\r\nmade a passage for the melted snow to run off into a hollow, back of the\r\ncoach; and as I kept up a good strong fire, the drops of water and\r\noccasional pieces of snow which fell into it were not able to extinguish\r\nit. The cavern enlarged rapidly, and in a little more than an hour the\r\nroof became so thin that while I was outside collecting wood it fell in\r\nand extinguished the fire. This accident, however, interrupted my\r\noperations but for a short time. I cleared away the snow at the bottom\r\nof the excavation, and rebuilt my fire on the bare ground. The high snow\r\nwalls on three sides of it protected it from the wind, so that there was\r\nno danger of the flames being blown against the stage-coach, while the\r\nlarge open space above allowed a free vent for the smoke.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the afternoon, to the great delight of us all, it\r\nstopped snowing, and when I had freshly shoveled out the path across\r\nthe road, my companions gladly embraced the opportunity of walking over\r\nto the comparatively protected ground under the trees and giving\r\nthemselves a little exercise. During their absence I was busily engaged\r\nin arranging the fire, when I heard a low crunching sound on one side of\r\nme, and, turning my head, I saw in the wall of my excavation opposite to\r\nthe stage-coach, and at a distance of four or five feet from the ground,\r\nan irregular hole in the snow, about a foot in diameter, from which\r\nprotruded the head of a man. This head was wrapped, with the exception\r\nof the face, in a brown woolen comforter. The features were those of a\r\nman of about fifty, a little sallow and thin, without beard, whiskers,\r\nor mustache, although the cheeks and chin were darkened with a recent\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe astounding apparition of this head projecting itself from the snow\r\nwall of my cabin utterly paralyzed me, so that I neither moved nor\r\nspoke, but remained crouching by the fire, my eyes fixed upon the head.\r\nIt smiled a little, and then spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Could you lend me a small iron pot?\" it said.\r\n\r\nI rose to my feet, almost ready to run away. Was this a dream? Or was it\r\npossible that there was a race of beings who inhabited snowbanks?\r\n\r\nThe face smiled again very pleasantly. \"Do not be frightened,\" it said.\r\n\"I saw you were startled, and spoke first of a familiar pot in order to\r\nreassure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, in the name of Heaven, are you?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"I am only a traveler, sir,\" said the head, \"who has met with an\r\naccident similar, I imagine, to that which has befallen you. But I\r\ncannot further converse with you in this position. Lying thus on my\r\nbreast in a tunnel of snow will injuriously chill me. Could you\r\nconveniently lend me an iron pot?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'COULD YOU LEND ME A SMALL IRON POT?'\"]\r\n\r\nI was now convinced that this was an ordinary human being, and my\r\ncourage and senses returned to me; but my astonishment remained\r\nboundless. \"Before we talk of pots,\" I said, \"I must know who you are,\r\nand how you got into that snowbank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe,\" said my visitor, \"that I can get down, head\r\nforemost, to your level. I will therefore retire to my place of refuge,\r\nand perhaps we can communicate with each other through this aperture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I get through to your place of refuge?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" was the answer. \"You are young and active, and the descent\r\nwill not be so deep on my side. But I will first retire, and will then\r\nproject toward you this sheepskin rug, which, if kept under you as you\r\nmove forward, will protect your breast and arms from direct contact with\r\nthe snow.\"\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to scramble up into the hole, but I succeeded in doing\r\nit, and found awaiting me the sheepskin rug, which, by the aid of an\r\numbrella, the man had pushed toward me for my use. I was in a horizontal\r\ntunnel barely large enough for the passage of my body, and about six\r\nfeet in length. When I had worked my way through this, and had put my\r\nhead out of the other end, I looked into a small wooden shed, into which\r\nlight entered only through a pane of glass set in a rude door opposite\r\nto me. I immediately perceived that the whole place was filled with the\r\nodor of spirituous liquors. The man stood awaiting me, and by his\r\nassistance I descended to the floor. As I did so I heard something\r\nwhich sounded like a titter, and looking around I saw in a corner a\r\nbundle of clothes and traveling-rugs, near the top of which appeared a\r\npair of eyes. Turning again, I could discern in another corner a second\r\nbundle, similar to, but somewhat larger than, the other.\r\n\r\n\"These ladies are traveling with me,\" said the man, who was now wrapping\r\nabout him a large cloak, and who appeared to be of a tall though rather\r\nslender figure. His manner and voice were those of a gentleman,\r\nextremely courteous and considerate. \"As I am sure you are curious—and\r\nthis I regard as quite natural, sir—to know why we are here, I will at\r\nonce proceed to inform you. We started yesterday in a carriage for the\r\nrailway-station, which is, I believe, some miles beyond this point.\r\nThere were two roads from the last place at which we stopped, and we\r\nchose the one which ran along a valley, and which we supposed would be\r\nthe pleasanter of the two. We there engaged a pair of horses which did\r\nnot prove very serviceable animals, and, at a point about a hundred\r\nyards from where we now are, one of them gave out entirely. The driver\r\ndeclared that the only thing to be done was to turn loose the disabled\r\nhorse, which would be certain, in time, to find his way back to his\r\nstable, and for him to proceed on the other animal to the station to\r\nwhich we were going, where he would procure some fresh horses and return\r\nas speedily as possible. To this plan we were obliged to consent, as\r\nthere was no alternative. He told us that if we did not care to remain\r\nin the carriage, there was a shed by the side of the road, a little\r\nfarther on, which was erected for the accommodation of men who are\r\nsometimes here in charge of relays of horses. After assuring us that he\r\nwould not be absent more than three hours, he rode away, and we have not\r\nseen him since.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after he left us I came to this shed, and finding it tight and\r\ncomparatively comfortable, I concluded it would give us relief from our\r\nsomewhat cramped position in the carriage, and so conducted the ladies\r\nhere. As night drew on it became very cold, and I determined to make a\r\nfire, a proceeding which, of course, would have been impossible in a\r\nvehicle. Fortunately I had with me, at the back of the carriage, a case\r\nof California brandy. By the aid of a stone I knocked the top off this\r\ncase, and brought hither several of the bottles. I found in the shed an\r\nold tin pan, which I filled with the straw coverings of the bottles, and\r\non this I poured brandy, which, being ignited, produced a fire without\r\nsmoke, but which, as we gathered around it, gave out considerable heat.\"\r\n\r\nAs the speaker thus referred to his fuel, I understood the reason of the\r\nstrong odor of spirits which filled the shed, and I experienced a\r\ncertain relief in my mind.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman continued: \"At first I attributed the delay of the\r\ndriver's return to those ordinary hindrances which so frequently occur\r\nin rural and out-of-the-way places; but after a time I could not imagine\r\nany reasonable cause for his delay. As it began to grow dark I brought\r\nhere our provision-baskets, and we partook of a slight repast. I then\r\nmade the ladies as comfortable as possible, and awaited with much\r\nanxiety the return of the driver.\r\n\r\n\"After a time it began to snow, and feeling that the storm might\r\ninterrupt communication with the carriage, I brought hither, making many\r\ntrips for the purpose, the rest of the brandy, our wraps and rugs, and\r\nthe cushions of the carriage. I did not believe that we should be left\r\nhere all night, but thought it prudent to take all precautions, and to\r\nprepare for remaining in a place where we could have a fire. The morning\r\nshowed me that I had acted wisely. As you know, sir, I found the road in\r\neach direction completely blocked up by snow, and I have since been\r\nunable to visit the carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not all suffered from cold?\" I inquired. \"Have you food\r\nenough?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not say,\" replied the gentleman, \"that in addition to our\r\nanxiety we have not suffered somewhat from cold, but for the greater\r\npart of this day I have adopted a plan which has resulted in\r\nconsiderable comfort to my companions. I have wrapped them up very\r\nclosely and warmly, and they hold in each hand a hard-boiled egg. I\r\nthought it better to keep these for purposes of warmth than to eat them.\r\nAbout every half-hour I reboil the eggs in a little traveling tea-pot\r\nwhich we have. They retain their warmth for a considerable period, and\r\nthis warmth in a moderate degree is communicated through the hands to\r\nthe entire person.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this a low laugh again burst forth from the bundle in one\r\ncorner of the room, and I could not help smiling at this odd way of\r\nkeeping warm. I looked toward the jocose bundle, and remarked that the\r\neggs must be pretty hard by this time.\r\n\r\n\"These ladies,\" said the gentleman, \"are not accustomed to the cold\r\natmosphere of this region, and I have therefore forbidden them to talk,\r\nhoping thus to prevent injury from the inhalation of frosty air. So far\r\nwe have not suffered, and we still have some food left. About noon I\r\nnoticed smoke floating over this shed, and I forced open the door and\r\nmade my way for some little distance outside, hoping to discover whence\r\nit came. I then heard voices on the other side of the enormous\r\nsnow-drift behind us; but I could see no possible way of getting over\r\nthe drift. Feeling that I must, without fail, open communication with\r\nany human beings who might be near us, I attempted to shout; but the\r\ncold had so affected my voice that I could not do so. I thereupon set my\r\nwits to work. At the back of this shed is a small window closed by a\r\nwooden shutter. I opened this shutter, and found outside a wall of snow\r\npacked closely against it. The snow was not very hard, and I believed\r\nthat it would not be difficult to tunnel a way through it to the place\r\nwhere the voices seemed to be. I immediately set to work, for I feared\r\nthat if we were obliged to remain here another night without assistance\r\nwe should be compelled to-morrow morning to eat those four hard-boiled\r\neggs which the ladies are holding, and which, very shortly, I must boil\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage to cut through the snow?\" I asked. \"Had you a\r\nshovel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" replied the other. \"I used the tin pan. I found it answered\r\nvery well as a scoop. Each time that I filled it I threw the contents\r\nout of our door.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have been slow and difficult work,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it was,\" he replied. \"The labor was arduous, and occupied me\r\nseveral hours. But when I saw a respectable man at a fire, and a\r\nstage-coach near by, I felt rewarded for all my trouble. May I ask you,\r\nsir, how you came to be thus snow-bound?\"\r\n\r\nI then briefly related the circumstances of our mishap, and had scarcely\r\nfinished when a shrill sound came through the tunnel into the shed. It\r\nwas the voice of Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" she screamed, \"are you in there? An' you don't mean to tell me\r\nthere are other people in that hole?\"\r\n\r\nFeeling quite certain that my wife and her companions were in a state of\r\nmental agitation on the other side of the drift, I called back that I\r\nwould be with them in a moment, and then explained to the gentleman why\r\nI could not remain with him longer. \"But before I go,\" I said, \"is there\r\nanything I can do for you? Do you really want an iron pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"The food that remains to us,\" he answered, \"is fragmentary and rather\r\ndistasteful to the ladies, and I thought if I could make a little stew\r\nof it, it might prove more acceptable to them. But do not let me detain\r\nyou another instant from your friends, and I advise you to go through\r\nthat tunnel feet foremost, for you might, otherwise, experience\r\ndifficulties in getting out at the other end.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted his suggestion, and by his assistance and the help of the\r\nrough window-frame, I got into the hole feet first, and soon ejected\r\nmyself into the midst of my alarmed companions. When they heard where I\r\nhad been, and what I had seen, they were naturally astounded.\r\n\r\n\"Another party deserted at this very point!\" exclaimed Ruth, who was\r\nboth excitable and imaginative. \"This looks like a conspiracy! Are we to\r\nbe robbed and murdered?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words Mrs. Aleshine sprang toward me. \"Mr. Craig,\" she\r\nexclaimed, \"if it's robbers, don't lose a minute! Never let 'em get\r\nahead of you! Pull out your pistol and fire through the hole!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious me! Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"you don't suppose the\r\nrobbers is them poor unfortunates on the other side of the drift! And I\r\nmust say, Mrs. Craig, that if there was any such thing as a conspiracy,\r\nyour father must have been in it, for it was him who landed us just\r\nhere. But of course none of us supposes nothin' of that kind, and the\r\nfirst thing we've got to think of is what we can do for them poor\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have some food left, but not much,\" I said, \"and I fear\r\nthey must be suffering from cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we poke some wood to them through this hole?\" said Mrs.\r\nAleshine, whose combative feelings had changed to the deepest\r\ncompassion. \"I should think they must be nearly froze, with nothin' to\r\nwarm 'em but hard-b'iled eggs.\"\r\n\r\nI explained that there was no place in their shed where they could build\r\na fire, and proposed that we should give them some hot tea and some of\r\nour provisions.\r\n\r\n\"That's so!\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"Just shout in to them that if they'll\r\nshove them eggs through the hole, I'll bile 'em fur 'em as often as they\r\nwant 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've just got to say this,\" ejaculated Mrs. Lecks, as she and Mrs.\r\nAleshine were busily placing a portion of our now very much reduced\r\nstock of provisions in the smallest of our baskets: \"this is the first\r\ntime in my life that I ever heard of people warmin' themselves up with\r\nhens' eggs and spirits, excep' when mixed up into egg-nog; and that they\r\nresisted that temptation and contented themselves with plain honest\r\nheat, though very little of it, shows what kind of people they must be.\r\nAnd now, do you suppose we could slide this basket in without upsettin'\r\nthe little kittle?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE WERE ABOUT TO SEND HIM A BASKET.\"]\r\n\r\nI called to the gentleman that we were about to send him a basket, and\r\nthen, by the aid of an umbrella, I gently pushed it through the snow\r\ntunnel to a point where he could reach it. Hearty thanks came back to us\r\nthrough the hole, and when the basket and kettle were returned, we\r\nprepared our own evening meal.\r\n\r\n\"For the life of me,\" said Mrs. Lecks, as she sipped a cup of tea, \"I\r\ncan't imagine, if there was a shed so near us, why we didn't know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That has been puzzling me,\" I replied; \"but the other road, on which\r\nthe shed is built, is probably lower than this one, so that the upper\r\npart of the shed could not have projected far above the embankment\r\nbetween the two roads, and if there were weeds and dead grasses on the\r\nbank, as there probably were, they would have prevented us from noticing\r\nthe top of a weather-worn shed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"as we wasn't lookin' for sheds, and, as\r\nfar as I know, we wasn't lookin' for anything on that side of the coach,\r\nfor all my eyes was busy starin' about on the side we got in and out of,\r\nand down the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which mine was too,\" added Mrs. Aleshine. \"An' after it begun to snow\r\nwe couldn't see nothin' anyhow, partic'larly when everything was all\r\ncovered up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" added Mrs. Lecks, in conclusion, \"as we didn't see the shed,\r\nit's a comfort to think there was reasons for it, and that we are not\r\nborn fools.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now growing dark, and but few further communications took place\r\nthrough the little tunnel.\r\n\r\n\"Before we get ready to go to sleep,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for, havin'\r\nno candles, I guess we won't sit up late, hadn't we better rig up some\r\nkind of a little sled to put in that hole, with strings at both ends, so\r\nthat we kin send in mustard-plasters and peppermint to them poor people\r\nif they happen to be sick in the night?\"\r\n\r\nThis little project was not considered necessary, and after receiving\r\nassurances from the gentleman on the other side that he would be able to\r\nkeep his party warm until morning, we bade each other good night; and,\r\nafter having replenished the fire, I got into the stage, where my\r\ncompanions had already established themselves in their corners. I slept\r\nvery little, while I frequently went out to attend to the fire, and my\r\nmind was racked by the most serious apprehensions. Our food was nearly\r\ngone, and if relief did not come to us very soon I could see nothing but\r\na slow death before us, and, so far as I could imagine, there was no\r\nmore reason to expect succor on the following day than there had been on\r\nthe one just passed. Where were the men to be found who could cut a road\r\nto us through those miles of snow-drifts?\r\n\r\nVery little was said during the night by my companions, but I am sure\r\nthat they felt the seriousness of our situation, and that their slumbers\r\nwere broken and unrefreshing. If there had been anything to do, Mrs.\r\nLecks and Mrs. Aleshine would have been cheered up by the prospect of\r\ndoing it; but we all felt that there was nothing we could do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a second night spent in the stage-coach on that lonely and\r\ndesolate mountain road where we were now snow-bound, I arose early in\r\nthe morning, and went into the forest to collect some fuel; and while\r\nthus engaged I made the discovery that the snow was covered with a hard\r\ncrust which would bear my weight. After the storm had ceased the day\r\nbefore, the sun had shone brightly and the temperature had moderated\r\nvery much, so that the surface of the snow had slightly thawed. During\r\nthe night it became cold again, and this surface froze into a hard\r\ncoating of ice. When I found I could walk where I pleased, my spirits\r\nrose, and I immediately set out to view the situation. The aspect of the\r\nroad gave me no encouragement. The snowfall had been a heavy one, but\r\nhad it not been for the high wind which accompanied it, it would have\r\nthrown but moderate difficulties in the way of our rescue. Reaching a\r\npoint which commanded a considerable view along the side of the\r\nmountain, I could see that in many places the road was completely lost\r\nto sight on account of the great snow-drifts piled up on it. I then\r\nwalked to the point where the two roads met, and crossing over, I\r\nclimbed a slight rise in the ground which had cut off my view in this\r\ndirection, and found myself in a position from which I could look\r\ndirectly down the side of the mountain below the road.\r\n\r\nHere, the mountain-side, which I had supposed to be very steep and\r\nrugged, descended in a long and gradual slope to the plains below, and\r\nfor the greater part of the distance was covered by a smooth, shining\r\nsurface of frozen snow, unbroken by rock or tree. This snowy slope\r\napparently extended for a mile or more, and then I could see that it\r\ngradually blended itself into the greenish-brown turf of the lower\r\ncountry. Down in the valley there still were leaves upon the trees, and\r\nthere were patches of verdure over the land. The storm which had piled\r\nits snows up here had given them rain down there and had freshened\r\neverything. It was like looking down into another climate and on another\r\nland. I saw a little smoke coming up behind a patch of trees. It must be\r\nthat there was a house there! Could it be possible that we were within a\r\nmile or two of a human habitation? Yet, what comfort was there in that\r\nthought? The people in that house could not get to us, nor we to them,\r\nnor could they have heard of our situation, for the point where our road\r\nreached the lower country was miles farther on.\r\n\r\nAs I stood thus and gazed, it seemed to me that I could make a run and\r\nslide down the mountain-side into green fields, into safety, into life.\r\nI remembered those savage warriors who, looking from the summits of the\r\nAlps upon the fertile plains of Italy, seated themselves upon their\r\nshields and slid down to conquest and rich spoils.\r\n\r\nAn idea came into my mind, and I gave it glad welcome. There was no time\r\nto be lost. The sun was not yet high, but it was mounting in a clear\r\nsky, and should its rays become warm enough to melt the crust on which I\r\nstood, our last chance of escape would be gone. To plow our way to any\r\nplace through deep, soft snow would be impossible. I hurried back to our\r\ncoach, and found three very grave women standing around the fire. They\r\nwere looking at a small quantity of food at the bottom of a large\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n\"That's every crumb there is left,\" said Mrs. Aleshine to me, \"and when\r\nwe pass in some to them unfortunates on the other side of the\r\ndrift,—which, of course, we're bound to do,—we'll have what I call a\r\nskimpy meal. And that's not the worst of it. Until somebody gets up to\r\nus, it will be our last meal.\"\r\n\r\nI took my poor Ruth by the hand, for she was looking very pale and\r\ntroubled, and I said: \"My dear friends, nobody can get up to this place\r\nfor a long, long time; and before help could possibly reach us we should\r\nall be dead. But do not be frightened. It is not necessary to wait for\r\nany one to come to us. The snow is now covered with a crust which will\r\nbear our weight. I have thought of a way in which we can slide down the\r\nmountain-side, which, from a spot where I have been standing this\r\nmorning, is no steeper than some coasting-hills, though very much\r\nlonger. In a few minutes we can pass from this region of snow, where\r\ndeath from cold and starvation must soon overtake us, to a grassy valley\r\nwhere there is no snow, and where we shall be within walking distance of\r\na house in which people are living.\"\r\n\r\nRuth grasped my arm. \"Will it be safe?\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" I answered. \"I see no reason why we should meet with any\r\naccident. At any rate, it is much safer than remaining here for another\r\nhour; for if the crust melts, our last chance is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Craig,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"me and Mrs. Aleshine is no hands at\r\ncoastin' downhill, havin' given up that sort of thing since we was\r\nlittle girls with short frocks and it didn't make no matter anyway. But\r\nyou know more about these things than we do; and if you say we can get\r\nout of this dreadful place by slidin' downhill, we're ready to follow,\r\nif you'll just go ahead. We followed you through the ocean, with nothin'\r\nbetween our feet and the bottom but miles o' water and nobody knows what\r\nsorts of dreadful fish; and when you say it's the right way to save our\r\nlives, we're ready to follow you again. And as for you, Mrs. Ruth, don't\r\nyou be frightened. I don't know what we're goin' to slide on, but,\r\nwhatever it is, even if it's our own selves, me and Mrs. Aleshine will\r\ntake you between us, and if anything is run against, we'll get the\r\nbumps, and not you.\"\r\n\r\nI was delighted to see how rapidly my proposition was accepted, and we\r\nmade a hasty breakfast, first sending in some of our food to the other\r\nparty. The gentleman reported through the hole of communication that\r\nthey were all fairly well, but a good deal stiffened by cold and want of\r\nexercise. He inquired, in a very anxious voice, if I had discovered any\r\nsigns of approaching relief. To this I replied that I had devised a plan\r\nby which we could get ourselves out of our present dangerous situation,\r\nand that in a very short time I would come round to the door of his\r\nshed—for I could now walk on the crusted snow—and tell him about it.\r\nHe answered that these words cheered his heart, and that he would do\r\neverything possible to coöperate with me.\r\n\r\nI now went to work vigorously. I took the cushions from the coach, four\r\nof them all together, and carried them to the brink of the slope down\r\nwhich I purposed to make our descent. I also conveyed thither a long\r\ncoil of rawhide rope which I had previously discovered in the boot of\r\nthe coach. I then hurried along the other road, which, as has been said\r\nbefore, lay at a somewhat lower level than the one we were on, and when\r\nI reached the shed I found the door had been opened, and the gentleman,\r\nwith his tin pan, had scooped away a good deal of the snow about it, so\r\nas to admit of a moderately easy passage in and out. He met me outside,\r\nand grasped my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if you have a plan to propose,\" he said, \"state it quickly. We are\r\nin a position of great danger. Those two ladies inside the shed cannot\r\nmuch longer endure this exposure, and I presume that the ladies in your\r\nparty—although their voices, which I occasionally hear, do not seem to\r\nindicate it—must be in a like condition.\"\r\n\r\nI replied that, so far, my companions had borne up very well, and\r\nwithout further waste of words proceeded to unfold my plan of escape.\r\n\r\nWhen he had heard it the gentleman put on a very serious expression. \"It\r\nseems hazardous,\" he said, \"but it may be the only way out of our\r\ndanger. Will you show me the point from which you took your\r\nobservations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I; \"but we must be in haste. The sun is getting up in the\r\nsky, and this crust may soon begin to melt. It is not yet really winter,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\nWe stepped quickly to the spot where I had carried the cushions. The\r\ngentleman stood and silently gazed first at the blocked-up roadway, then\r\nat the long, smooth slope of the mountain-side directly beneath us, and\r\nthen at the verdure of the plain below, which had grown greener under\r\nthe increasing brightness of the day. \"Sir,\" said he, turning to me,\r\n\"there is nothing to be done but to adopt your plan, or to remain here\r\nand die. We will accompany you in the descent, and I place myself under\r\nyour orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first thing,\" said I, \"is to bring here your carriage cushions, and\r\nhelp me to arrange them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had brought the three cushions from the shed, the gentleman and\r\nI proceeded to place them with the others on the snow, so that the whole\r\nformed a sort of wide and nearly square mattress. Then, with the rawhide\r\nrope, we bound them together in a rough but secure network of cordage.\r\nIn this part of the work I found my companion very apt and skilful.\r\n\r\nWhen this rude mattress was completed, I requested the gentleman to\r\nbring his ladies to the place, while I went for mine.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to pack up to take with us?\" said Mrs. Aleshine, when I\r\nreached our coach.\r\n\r\n\"We take nothing at all,\" said I, \"but the money in our pockets, and our\r\nrugs and wraps. Everything else must be left in the coach, to be brought\r\ndown to us when the roads shall be cleared out.\"\r\n\r\nWith our rugs and shawls on our arms, we left the coach, and as we were\r\ncrossing the other road we saw the gentleman and his companions\r\napproaching. These ladies were very much wrapped up, but one of them\r\nseemed to step along lightly and without difficulty, while the other\r\nmoved slowly and was at times assisted by the gentleman.\r\n\r\nA breeze had sprung up which filled the air with fine frozen particles\r\nblown from the uncrusted beds of snow along the edge of the forest, and\r\nI counseled Ruth to cover up her mouth and breathe as little of this\r\nsnow powder as possible.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm to go coastin' at all,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"I'd as lief do it\r\nwith strangers as friends; and a little liefer, for that matter, if\r\nthere's any bones to be broken. But I must say that I'd like to make the\r\nacquaintance of them ladies afore I git on to the sled, which\"—at that\r\nmoment catching sight of the mattress—\"you don't mean to say that\r\nthat's it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, from underneath her great woolen\r\ncomforter, \"if you want to get your lungs friz, you'd better go on\r\ntalkin'. Manners is manners, but they can wait till we get to the\r\nbottom of the hill.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this admonition, I noticed that as soon as the two\r\nparties met, both Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine advanced and shook hands\r\nwith the ladies who had been their neighbors under such peculiar\r\ncircumstances, and that Mrs. Lecks herself expressed a muffled hope that\r\nthey might all get down safely.\r\n\r\nI now pushed the mattress which was to serve as our sled as close as was\r\nprudent to the edge of the descent, and requested the party to seat\r\nthemselves upon it. Without hesitation Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine sat\r\ndown, taking Ruth between them, as they had promised to do. My young\r\nwife was very nervous, but the cool demeanor of her companions, and my\r\nevident belief in the practicability of the plan, gave her courage, and\r\nshe quietly took her seat. The younger of the two strange ladies stepped\r\nlightly on the cushions, and before seating herself stood up for a good\r\nlook at the far-extending bed of snow over which we were to take our\r\nway. The prospect did not appear to deter her, and she sat down promptly\r\nand with an air that seemed to say that she anticipated a certain\r\nenjoyment from the adventure. The elder lady, however, exhibited very\r\ndifferent emotions. She shrank back from the cushions toward which the\r\ngentleman was conducting her, and turned her face away from the\r\ndeclivity. Her companion assured her that it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat we should descend from the mountain in this way, for there was no\r\nother; and asserting his belief that our slide would be a perfectly\r\nsafe one, he gently drew her to the mattress and induced her to sit\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI now noticed, for the first time, that the gentleman carried under one\r\narm, and covered by his long cloak, a large package of some sort, and I\r\nimmediately said to him: \"It will be very imprudent for us to attempt to\r\ncarry any of our property except what we can put in our pockets or wrap\r\naround us. Everything else should be left here, either in your carriage\r\nor our coach, and I have no fear that anything will be lost. But even if\r\nour luggage were in danger of being molested, we cannot afford to\r\nconsider it under circumstances such as these.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the gentleman, speaking very gravely, \"I appreciate\r\nthe hazards of our position as keenly as yourself. Our valises, and all\r\nthe light luggage which we had with us in our carriage, I have left\r\nthere, and shall not give them another thought. But with the parcel I\r\nhold under this arm I cannot part, and if I go down the mountain-side on\r\nthese cushions, it must go with me. If you refuse in such a case to\r\nallow me to be one of your party, I must remain behind, and endeavor to\r\nfind a board or something else on which I can make the descent of the\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke courteously, but with an air of decision which showed me that\r\nit would be of no use to argue with him. Besides, there was no time for\r\nparleying, and if this gentleman chose to take his chances with but one\r\narm at liberty, it was no longer my affair. I therefore desired him to\r\nsit down, and I arranged the company so that they sat back to back,\r\ntheir feet drawn up to the edge of the mattress. I then took the place\r\nwhich had been reserved for me as steersman, and having tied several\r\nshawls together, end to end, I passed them around the whole of us under\r\nour arms, thus binding us all firmly together. I felt that one of our\r\ngreatest dangers would be that one or more of the party might slip from\r\nthe mattress during the descent.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready I asked the gentleman, who, with the elder lady, sat\r\nnear me at the back of the mattress, to assist in giving us a start by\r\npushing outward with his heels while I thrust the handle of my wooden\r\nshovel into the crust and thus pushed the mattress forward. The starting\r\nwas a little difficult, but in a minute or two we had pushed the\r\nmattress partly over the brink, and then, after a few more efforts, we\r\nbegan to slide downward.\r\n\r\nThe motion, at first slow, suddenly became quite rapid, and I heard\r\nbehind me a cry or exclamation, from whom I knew not, but I felt quite\r\nsure it did not come from any of my party. I hoped to be able to make\r\nsome use of my shovel in the guidance of our unwieldy raft or\r\nmattress-sled, but I soon found this impossible, and down we went over\r\nthe smooth, hard-frozen slope, with nothing to direct our course but the\r\nvarying undulations of the mountain-side. Every moment we seemed to go\r\nfaster and faster, and soon we began to revolve, so that sometimes I was\r\nin front and sometimes behind. Once, when passing over a very smooth\r\nsheet of snow, we fairly spun around, so that in every direction feet\r\nwere flying out from a common center and heels grating on the frozen\r\ncrust. But there were no more cries or exclamations. Each one of us\r\ngrasped the cordage which held the cushions together, and the rapidity\r\nof the motion forced us almost to hold our breath.\r\n\r\nDown the smooth, white slope we sped, as a bird skims through the air.\r\nIt seemed to me as if we passed over miles and miles of snow. Sometimes\r\nmy face was turned down the mountain, where the snow-surface seemed to\r\nstretch out illimitably, and then it was turned upward toward the\r\napparently illimitable slopes over which we had passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE BEGAN TO SLIDE DOWNWARD.\"]\r\n\r\nPresently, my position now being in front of the little group that\r\nglanced along its glittering way, I saw at some distance below me a long\r\nrise or terrace, which ran along the mountain-side for a considerable\r\ndistance, and which cut off our view of everything below us. As we\r\napproached this hillock the descent became much more gradual and our\r\nprogress slower, and at last I began to fear that our acquired velocity\r\nwould not be sufficient to carry us up the side of this elevation and so\r\nenable us to continue our descent. I therefore called to everybody in\r\nthe rear to kick out vigorously, and with my shovel I endeavored to\r\nassist our progress. As we approached the summit of the elevation we\r\nmoved slower and slower. I became very anxious, for, should we slide\r\nbackward, we might find it difficult or impossible to get ourselves and\r\nthe mattress up this little hill. But the gentleman and myself worked\r\nvaliantly, and as for Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, they kicked their\r\nheels through the frozen crust with such energy that we moved sidewise\r\nalmost as much as upward. But in a moment the anxious suspense was over,\r\nand we rested on the ridge of the long hillock, with the mountain-side\r\nstretching down to the plain, which lay not very far below us.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to remain here a few minutes to regain breath,\r\nand give some consideration to the rest of our descent, but as some of\r\nthose behind continued to push, the mattress slid over the edge of the\r\nterrace, and down again we went. Our progress now was not so rapid, but\r\nit was very much more unpleasant. The snow was thinner; there was little\r\nor no crust upon it, and we very soon reached a wide extent of exposed\r\nturf, over which we slid, but not without a good deal of bumping against\r\nstones and protuberances. Then there was another sheet of snow, which\r\nquickened our downward impetus; and, after that, the snow was seen only\r\nin occasional patches, and our progress continued over a long slope of\r\nshort, partly dried grass, which was very slippery, and over which we\r\npassed with considerable quickness.\r\n\r\nI wished now to bring our uncouth sled to a stop, and to endeavor to\r\nmake the rest of the descent on foot. But although I stuck out my\r\nheels, and tried to thrust the handle of my shovel into the ground, it\r\nwas of no use. On we went, and the inequalities of the surface gave an\r\nirregularity of motion which was uncomfortable and alarming. We turned\r\nto this side and that; we bounced and bumped; and the rawhide ropes,\r\nwhich must have been greatly frayed and cut by the snow-crust, now gave\r\nway in several places, and I knew that the mattress would soon separate\r\ninto its original cushions, if indeed they still could be called\r\ncushions. Fearing increased danger should we now continue bound together\r\nin a bunch, I jerked apart the shawl-knot under my arms, and the next\r\nmoment, it seemed to me, there was a general dissolution of our\r\nconnection with each other. Fortunately, we were now near the bottom of\r\nthe slope, for while some of us stuck fast to the cushions, others\r\nrolled over, or slid, independent of any projection, while I, being\r\nthrown forward on my feet, actually ran downhill! I had just succeeded\r\nin stopping myself when down upon me came the rest of the company, all\r\nprostrate in some position or other.\r\n\r\nNow from an unwieldy mass of shawls came a cry:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Albert Dusante! Where are you? Lucille! Lucille!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly sprang to one foot good Mrs. Aleshine, her other foot being\r\nentangled in a mass of shawls which dragged behind her. Her bonnet was\r\nsplit open and mashed down over her eyes. In her left hand she waved a\r\npiece of yellow flannel, which in her last mad descent she had torn from\r\nsome part of the person of Mrs. Lecks, and in the other a bunch of stout\r\ndead weeds, which she had seized and pulled up by the roots as she had\r\npassed them. Her dress was ripped open down her rotund back, and the\r\nearth from the weed roots had bespattered her face. From the midst of\r\nthis dilapidation her round eyes sparkled with excitement. Hopping on\r\none foot, the shawls and a part of a cushion dragging behind her, she\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"The Dusantes! They are the Dusantes!\"\r\n\r\nThen, pitching forward on her knees before the two strange ladies, who\r\nhad now tumbled into each other's arms, she cried:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, which is Emily, and which is Lucille?\"\r\n\r\nI had rushed toward Ruth, who had clung to a cushion and was now sitting\r\nupon it, when Mrs. Lecks, who was close beside her, arose to her feet\r\nand stood upright. One foot was thrust through her own bonnet, and her\r\nclothes gave evidence of the frenzy and power of Mrs. Aleshine's grasp,\r\nbut her mien was dignified and her aspect stately.\r\n\r\n\"Barb'ry Aleshine!\" she exclaimed, \"if them Dusantes has dropped down\r\nfrom heaven at your very feet, can't you give 'em a minute to feel their\r\nribs and see if their legs and arms is broken?\"\r\n\r\nThe younger lady now turned her head toward Mrs. Aleshine. \"I am\r\nLucille,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the good woman's arms were around her neck. \"I always liked\r\nyou the best of the two,\" she whispered into the ear of the astonished\r\nyoung lady.\r\n\r\nHaving found that Ruth was unhurt, I ran to the assistance of the\r\nothers. The gentleman had just arisen from a cushion, upon which, lying\r\nflat on his back, he had slid over the grass, still holding under one\r\narm the package from which he had refused to part. I helped him to raise\r\nthe elder lady to her feet. She had been a good deal shaken, and much\r\nfrightened, but although a little bruised, she had received no important\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'OH, WHICH IS EMILY, AND WHICH IS LUCILLE?'\"]\r\n\r\nI went to fill a leather pocket-cup from a brook nearby, and when I\r\nreturned I found the gentleman standing, confronted by Mrs. Lecks, Mrs.\r\nAleshine, and Ruth, while his own companions were regarding the group\r\nwith eager interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he was saying, \"my name is Dusante. But why do you ask at this\r\nmoment? Why do you show such excited concern on the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Mrs. Lecks. \"I will tell you why, sir. My name is Mrs.\r\nLecks, and this is Mrs. Aleshine, and if you are the Mr. Dusante with\r\nthe house on the desert island, this is the Mrs. Craig who was married\r\nin that very house, and the gentleman here with the water is Mr. Craig,\r\nwho wrote you the letter, which I hope you got. And if that isn't reason\r\nenough for our wanting to know if you are Mr. Dusante, I'd like to be\r\ntold what more there could be!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's them! Of course it's them!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine. \"I had a feelin'\r\nwhile we were scootin' downhill that they was near and dear to us,\r\nthough exactly why and how, I didn't know. And she's told me she's\r\nLucille, and of course the other must be Emily, though what relations—\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to understand,\" interrupted the gentleman, looking with earnest\r\nanimation from one to the other of us, \"that these are the good people\r\nwho inhabited my house on the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very ones!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine. \"And what relation are you to\r\nEmily? and Lucille to her?\"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman stepped backward and laid down the package which he had\r\nheld under his arm, and advancing toward me with outstretched hands, and\r\nwith tears starting to his eyes, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"And this man, then, to whom I owe so much, is Mr. Craig!\"\r\n\r\n\"Owe me!\" I said. \"It is to you that we owe our very lives, and our\r\nescape from death in mid-ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak of it,\" he said, shaking his head, with a sorrowful\r\nexpression on his face. \"You owe me nothing. I would to Heaven it were\r\nnot so! But we will not talk of that now. And this is Mrs. Craig,\" he\r\ncontinued, taking Ruth by the hand, \"the fair lady whose nuptials were\r\ncelebrated in my house. And Mrs. Lecks, and Mrs. Aleshine.\" As he spoke\r\nhe shook hands with each. \"How I have longed to meet you! I have thought\r\nof you every day since I returned to my island and discovered that you\r\nhad been—I wish I could say—my guests. And where is the reverend\r\ngentleman? and the three mariners? I hope that nothing has befallen\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!—for three of them at least,\" ejaculated Mrs. Aleshine; \"they\r\nhave left us, but they are all right. And now, sir, if you could tell us\r\nwhat relation you are to Emily, and what Lucille—\"\r\n\r\n\"Barb'ry!\" cried Mrs. Lecks, making a dash toward her friend, \"can't you\r\ngive the man a minute to breathe? Don't you see he's so dumflustered\r\nthat he hardly knows who he is himself! If them two women was to sink\r\ndown dead with hunger and hard slidin' right afore your very eyes while\r\nyou was askin' what relation they was to each other and to him, it would\r\nno more'n serve you right! We'd better be seem' if anythin' 's the\r\nmatter with 'em, and what we can do for 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the younger of Mr. Dusante's ladies quickly stepped\r\nforward. \"Oh, Mrs. Craig, Mrs. Lecks, and Mrs. Aleshine!\" she exclaimed,\r\n\"I'm just dying to know all about you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And which, contrariwise,\" cried Mrs. Aleshine, \"is the same with us,\r\nexactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of all places in the world,\" continued the young lady, \"that we\r\nshould meet here!\"\r\n\r\nNo one could have been more desirous than I was to know all about these\r\nDusantes, and to discuss the strange manner of our meeting; but I saw\r\nthat Ruth was looking very pale and faint, and that the elder Dusante\r\nlady had sat down again upon the ground as though obliged to do so by\r\nsheer exhaustion, and I therefore hailed with a double delight the\r\ninterruption of further explanations by the appearance of two men on\r\nhorseback who came galloping toward us.\r\n\r\nThey belonged to the house which I had noticed from the road above, and\r\none of them had seen our swift descent down the mountain-side. At first\r\nhe had thought the black object he saw sliding over the snow-slopes was\r\na rock or a mass of underbrush, but his keen eye soon told him that it\r\nwas a group of human beings, and summoning a companion, he had set out\r\nfor the foot of the mountain as soon as horses could be caught and\r\nsaddled.\r\n\r\nThe men were much surprised when they heard the details of our\r\nadventure, but as it was quite plain that some members of our party\r\nneeded immediate nourishment and attention, the questions and\r\nexplanations were made very short. The men dismounted from their horses,\r\nand the elder Dusante lady was placed upon one of them, one man leading\r\nthe animal and the other supporting the lady. Ruth mounted the other\r\nhorse, and I walked by her to assist her in keeping her seat; but she\r\nheld fast to the high pommel of the saddle, and got on very well. Mr.\r\nDusante took his younger companion on one arm, and his package under the\r\nother, while Mrs. Lecks, having relieved her foot from the encircling\r\nbonnet, and Mrs. Aleshine, now free from the entangling shawls, followed\r\nin the rear. The men offered to come back with the horses for them, if\r\nthey would wait; but the two women declared that they were quite able to\r\nwalk, and intended to do no waiting, and they trudged vigorously after\r\nus. The sun was now high, and the air down here was quite different from\r\nthat of the mountain-side, being pleasant and almost warm. The men said\r\nthat the snows above would probably soon melt, as it was much too early\r\nin the season for snow to lie long on these lower sides of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nOur way lay over an almost level plain for about a mile. A portion of it\r\nwas somewhat rough, so that when we reached the low house to which we\r\nwere bound, we were all very glad indeed to get there. The house\r\nbelonged to the two men, who owned a small ranch here. One of them was\r\nmarried, and his wife immediately set herself to work to attend to our\r\nneeds. Her home was small, its rooms few, and her larder very plain in\r\nquality; but everything she had was placed at our disposal. Her own bed\r\nwas given to the elder Dusante lady, who took immediate possession of\r\nit; and after a quickly prepared but plentiful meal of fried pork,\r\ncorn-bread, and coffee, the rest of us stretched ourselves out to rest\r\nwherever we could find a place. Before lying down, however, I had, at\r\nRuth's earnest solicitation, engaged one of the men to ride to the\r\nrailroad-station to inquire about Mr. Enderton, and to inform him of our\r\nsafety. By taking a route which ran parallel with the mountain-chain,\r\nbut at some distance from it, the station, the man said, could be\r\nreached without encountering snow.\r\n\r\nNone of us had had proper rest during the past two nights, and we slept\r\nsoundly until dark, when we were aroused to partake of supper. All of\r\nus, except the elder Dusante lady, who preferred to remain in bed,\r\ngathered around the table. After supper a large fire, principally of\r\nbrushwood, was built upon the hearth; and with the bright blaze, two\r\ncandles, and a lamp, the low room appeared light and cheery. We drew up\r\nabout the fire—for the night was cool—on whatever chairs, stools, or\r\nboxes we could find, and no sooner had we all seated ourselves than Mrs.\r\nAleshine exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Dusante, it ain't in the power of mortal man, nor woman\r\nneither,—an' if put the other way it might be stronger,—to wait any\r\nlonger before knowin' what relation Lucille is to Emily, an' you to\r\nthem, an' all about that house of yours on the island. If I'd blown up\r\ninto bits this day through holdin' in my wantin' to know, I shouldn't\r\nhave wondered! An' if it hadn't been for hard sleep, I don't believe I\r\ncould have held in, nohow!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WE DREW UP ABOUT THE FIRE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"That's my mind exactly,\" said Mrs. Lecks; \"and though I know there's a\r\ntime for all things, and don't believe in crowdin' questions on\r\nplayed-out people, I do think, Mr. Dusante, that if I could have caught\r\nup with you when we was comin' over here, I'd have asked you to speak\r\nout on these p'ints. But you're a long-legged walker, which Mrs.\r\nAleshine is not, and it wouldn't have done to leave her behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which she wouldn't 'a' been,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"long legs or short.\"\r\n\r\nRuth and I added our entreaties that Mr. Dusante should tell his story,\r\nand the good ranchman and his wife said that if there was anything to\r\nbe done in the story-telling line they were in for it, strong; and\r\nquitting their work of clearing away supper things, they brought an old\r\nhair trunk from another room, and sat down just behind Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\nThe younger Dusante lady, who, having been divested of her wraps, her\r\nveil, and the woolen shawl that had been tied over her head, had proved\r\nto be a very pretty girl with black eyes, here declared that it had been\r\nher intention at the first opportunity to get us to tell our story, but\r\nas we had asked first, she supposed we ought to be satisfied first.\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish, my good friends,\" said Mr. Dusante, \"to delay for a\r\nmoment longer than necessary your very pardonable curiosity concerning\r\nme and my family; and I must say at the same time that, although your\r\nletter, sir, gave me a very clear account of your visit to my island,\r\nthere are many things which naturally could not be contained within the\r\nlimits of a letter, and about which I am most anxious to make inquiries.\r\nBut these I will reserve until my own narration is finished.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Albert Dusante. It may interest you to know that my father\r\nwas a Frenchman and my mother an American lady from New England. I was\r\nborn in France, but have lived very little in that country, and for a\r\ngreat part of my life have been a merchant in Honolulu. For the past few\r\nyears, however, I have been enabled to free myself in a great degree\r\nfrom the trammels of business, and to devote myself to the pursuits of a\r\nman of leisure. I have never married, and this young lady is my\r\nsister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what relation,\" began Mrs. Aleshine, \"is she to—?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the hand of Mrs. Lecks, falling heavily into the lap of\r\nthe speaker, stopped this question, and Mr. Dusante proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Our parents died when Lucille was an infant, and we have no near blood\r\nrelations.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the faces of both Mrs. Aleshine and Mrs. Lecks assumed\r\nexpressions as if they had each just received a letter superscribed in\r\nan unknown hand, and were wondering who it could possibly be from.\r\n\r\n\"The lady who is now resting in the adjoining room,\" continued Mr.\r\nDusante, \"is a dear friend who has been adopted by me as a mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" burst from Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, in as much\r\nunison of time and tone as if the words had been a response in a church\r\nservice, while Miss Lucille leaned back against the wall near which she\r\nsat, and laughed gleefully. Mr. Dusante, however, continued his\r\nstatements with the same quiet gravity with which he had begun.\r\n\r\n\"This lady was a dear friend of my mother, although younger than she. I\r\nadopted her as a mother to my little orphan sister, and, consequently,\r\nplaced her in the same maternal relation to myself, doing this with much\r\nearnest satisfaction, for I hoped to be able to return, as a son,\r\nsomething of the tender care and affection which she would bestow on\r\nLucille as a daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she is Emily?\" cried Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"She adopted our name,\" answered the speaker, \"and she is Mrs. Emily\r\nDusante.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she is your adopted _mother?_\" said Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"Adopted mother!\" ejaculated Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Mr. Dusante.\r\n\r\n\"And that is the only relation she is to you two?\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"And you to her?\" added Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"Most assuredly,\" answered Mr. Dusante.\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Lecks leaned back in her chair, folded her hands in her lap,\r\nand ejaculated, \"Well, well!\" and then allowed her face to assume a\r\nrigid intention of having nothing more to say at the present moment.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, in a tone which\r\nindicated that she did not care who heard her; \"I always liked Lucille\r\nthe best!\"\r\n\r\nAt this Ruth and I exchanged smiles with Miss Lucille, and Mr. Dusante\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to occupy too much of your time with our personal\r\naffairs, and will therefore state that the island on which you found\r\nrefuge, and where I wish most heartily I had been present to act as\r\nhost, was bought by me as a retreat from the annoyances of business and\r\nthe exactions of society. I built there a good house—\"\r\n\r\n\"Which it truly was,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"with fixtures in it for\r\nwater, and letting it off, which I never saw in a house so far out of\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\"I furnished it suitably,\" said Mr. Dusante. \"We had books and music,\r\nand for several years we passed vacations there which were both\r\nenjoyable and profitable. But of late my sister has found the place\r\nlonely, and we have traveled a good deal, making intermittent and often\r\nshort visits to the island.\r\n\r\n\"As I never cared to leave any one on that lonely spot during our\r\nabsences from it, I arranged a gateway of bars across the only opening\r\nin the reef, with the intention of preventing marauding visits from\r\nfishing-boats or other small craft which might be passing that way. As\r\nthe island was out of the ordinary track of vessels, I did not imagine\r\nthat my bars would ever prove an obstacle to unfortunate castaways who\r\nmight seek a refuge there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which they didn't,\" remarked Mrs. Aleshine, \"for under we bobbed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never exactly understood,\" said Mr. Dusante, \"and I hope to have it\r\nexplained to me in due time, how you passed my bars without removing\r\nthem; and I have had a sore weight upon my conscience since I discovered\r\nthat shipwrecked persons, fleeing to my house from the perils of the\r\nsea, should have found those inhospitable bars in their way—\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is a weight you might as well cast off, and be done with it,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Lecks, her deep-set notions on the rights of property obliging\r\nher to speak; \"for if a man hasn't a right to lock up his house when he\r\ngoes away and leaves it, I don't know what rights anybody has about\r\nanything. Me, or Mrs. Aleshine, or anybody else here who has a house,\r\nmight just as well go off travelin', or to town visitin', and leave our\r\nfront door unlocked, and the yard gate swingin' on its hinges, because\r\nwe was afraid that some tramp or other body with no house or home might\r\ncome along and not be able to get in and make himself comfortable. Your\r\nbusiness, sir, when you left that house and all your belongin's on that\r\nisland, was to leave everything tight and safe; and the business of\r\npeople sailin' in ships was to go on their proper way, and not be\r\nrunnin' into each other. And if these last mentioned didn't see fit to\r\ndo that, and so got into trouble, they should have gone to some island\r\nwhere there were people to attend to 'em, just as the tramps should go\r\nto the poorhouse. And this is what we would have done—not meanin' the\r\npoorhouse—if we hadn't been so over long-headed as to get into a leaky\r\nboat, which, I wish it understood, is sayin' nothin' against Mr. Craig.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for nobody has got a right to\r\ncomplain that a fellow-bein' locks his own door after him. But it does\r\nseem to me, sir, that in such scattered neighborhoods as your island is\r\nin, it might be a good thing to leave something to eat an'\r\ndrink—perhaps in a bottle or in a tin pail—at the outside of your bars\r\nfor them as might come along shipwrecked, an' not be able to get inside\r\non account of bein' obliged to come in a boat, an' not as we did; an'\r\nso, when they found they'd have to go on, they might have somethin' to\r\nkeep up their strength till they got to another house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"when you start off on a\r\njourney to Japan or any other place, an' leave mince-pies and buttered\r\ntoast a-stickin' on the p'ints of your pickets for tramps that might\r\ncome along and need 'em, you can do that kind of talkin'. But as that\r\ntime hasn't come, let's hear the rest of Mr. Dusante's story.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I first visited my island this year,\" continued the narrator, \"we\r\nmade but a short stay, as we were all desirous of taking a somewhat\r\nextended sea-voyage in my steam-yacht. We visited several places of\r\ninterest, and when we returned, just six weeks ago to-day—\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one week, lackin' a day,\" exclaimed Mrs. Lecks, \"after we left\r\nthat spot!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I'd 'a' knowed,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, rising to her feet, \"that you'd\r\nbe back so soon, I'd 'a' made them sailormen live on fish, I'd 'a' eat\r\ngarden-truck myself, and I'd be bound I'd 'a' made the flour hold out\r\nfor six days more for the rest of 'em, if I'd 'a' had to work my fingers\r\nto the skin and bone to do it!\" Then she sat down solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"When we returned,\" continued Mr. Dusante, \"I was pleased to find my\r\nbars intact; and when these were unlocked, and the boat from our yacht\r\nwent through with ourselves and our servants, it was very agreeable to\r\nnotice the good order which seemed to prevail everywhere. As we passed\r\nfrom the wharf to the house, not even fallen boughs or weeds were seen\r\nto indicate that we had been away from the place for more than two\r\nmonths. When we entered the house, my mother and sister immediately\r\nascended to their chambers, and when the windows had been opened I heard\r\nthem from above calling to each other and remarking upon the freshness\r\nand cleanliness of the rooms. I went to my library, and when I had\r\nthrown open the window I was struck with the somewhat peculiar air of\r\norder which seemed to obtain in the room. The books stood upon their\r\nshelves with a remarkable regularity, and the chairs and other\r\nfurniture were arranged with a precision which impressed me as unusual.\r\nIn a moment, sir, I saw your letter upon the table addressed to me.\r\nGreatly astonished, I opened and read it.\r\n\r\n\"When I had finished it my amazement was great indeed; but obeying an\r\ninstant impulse, I stepped into the dining-room, which a servant had\r\nopened, and took the ginger-jar from the mantelpiece. When I lifted from\r\nit the little brown-paper parcel, and beneath it saw the money which had\r\nbeen mentioned in the letter, you may imagine the condition of my mind.\r\nI did not take out the money, nor count it; but covering it again with\r\nthe paper parcel, which I believed contained fish-hooks, and with the\r\njar in my hands, I returned to the library, where I sat down to ponder\r\nupon these most astounding revelations. While so doing my mother and\r\nsister hastily entered the room. Lucille declared in an excited manner\r\nthat she believed that the brownies or some other fairies had been there\r\nwhile we were away and had kept the house in order. The whole place was\r\nactually cleaner, she said, than when we left it. She had taken down a\r\nthin dress from her closet, and it looked as if it had just come from\r\nthe hand of a laundress, with the ruffles ironed smoother and more\r\nevenly than they had ever been since it was first stitched together.\r\n'Albert,' said my mother, her face pale, 'there has been somebody in\r\nthis house!' Then she went on to say that the windows, which were left\r\nunwashed because we went away in somewhat of a hurry, were as bright and\r\nclean as if the maids had just been rubbing them; the floors and\r\nfurniture were cleaner and freer from dust than they had ever been\r\nbefore; and the whole house looked as if we had just left it yesterday.\r\n'In fact,' she said, 'it is unnaturally clean!'\"\r\n\r\nDuring this part of Mr. Dusante's story Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine sat\r\nvery quiet, with an air of sedate humility upon their faces; but I could\r\nsee by the proud light in their eyes that they felt their superiority to\r\nordinary women, although they were properly resolved not to show such\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n\"At that moment,\" continued Mr. Dusante, \"a servant came hurrying into\r\nthe room, and informed us that the flour was all gone, and that there\r\nwas scarcely anything in the pantries to eat. At this my mother and my\r\nsister, who knew that an abundance of provisions had been left in the\r\nhouse, looked at each other aghast. But before they could express their\r\nconsternation in words, I addressed them. 'My dear mother,' said I, 'and\r\nLucille, there truly has been some one in this house. By this letter I\r\nam informed that for several weeks eight persons have lived here under\r\nthis roof; a marriage has been solemnized, and the happy couple have\r\ngone forth from our doors. These persons have eaten our food, they have\r\nmade use of our property, and this has been their temporary home. But\r\nthey are good people, honest and true-hearted, for they have left the\r\nhouse in better order than they found it, and more than the price of all\r\nthey have consumed is in that ginger-jar.' And thereupon I read them\r\nyour letter, sir.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot undertake to describe the wonder and absorbing interest with\r\nwhich this letter filled our minds. All needful stores were brought\r\nashore from the yacht, which lay outside the reef, and we began our\r\nusual life on the island; but none of the occupations or recreations in\r\nwhich we formerly employed our time now possessed any attractions for\r\nus. Our minds were filled with thoughts of the persons who had been so\r\nstrangely living in our house; and our conversation was mainly made up\r\nof surmises as to what sort of people they were, whether or not we\r\nshould ever see them, and similar suppositions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed!\" exclaimed Miss Lucille. \"I thought of you by day and by\r\nnight, and pictured you all in various ways, but never as you really\r\nare. Sometimes I used to think that the boat in which you went away had\r\nbeen sunk in a storm in which you were all drowned, and that perhaps\r\nyour ghosts would come back and live in our house, and sleep in our\r\nbeds, and clean our windows, and wash and iron our clothes, and do all\r\nsorts of things in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodnessful, gracious me!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine, \"don't talk that way!\r\nThe idea of bein' a cold ghost, goin' about in the dark, is worse than\r\nslidin' down a snow-mountain, even if you had to do it on the bare of\r\nyour back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barb'ry!\" said Mrs. Lecks, severely.\r\n\r\n\"The idea is jus' as chillin',\" replied her undaunted friend.\r\n\r\n\"Two things connected with this matter,\" continued Mr. Dusante, \"weighed\r\nheavily on my mind. One of these I have already mentioned—the cruel\r\ninhospitality of the barred entrance.\"\r\n\r\nI had refrained from adding to the interruptions to Mr. Dusante's\r\nnarrative, but I now felt impelled to assure the gentleman, on behalf of\r\nmyself and wife, that we shared the opinions of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs.\r\nAleshine, and felt that he could in no way be blamed for thus protecting\r\nhis private property.\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" said Mr. Dusante, \"but I will say here that there\r\nare now no bars to that entrance. I have left some people on the island,\r\nwho will take care of my property and succor any unfortunate castaways\r\nwho may arrive there. The other matter to which I alluded was, however,\r\nthe heavier load which oppressed me. This was the money in the\r\nginger-jar. I could not endure to reflect that I had been paid actual\r\nmoney for the hospitality I would have been so glad to offer to you poor\r\nshipwrecked people. Every sentiment of my being rebelled against such a\r\nthing. I was grieved. I was ashamed. At last I determined I would bear\r\nno longer the ignominy of this brand of inhospitality, and that, with\r\nthe ginger-jar in my hand, I would search over the world, if necessary,\r\nfor the persons who in my absence had paid board to me, and return to\r\nthem the jar with its contents uncounted and untouched. Your letter\r\ninformed me of the island to which you were bound, and if I did not find\r\nyou there I could discover to what port you had taken your departure.\r\nThere I could make further inquiries, and so follow you. When I proposed\r\nthis plan to my family they agreed to it instantly, for their interest\r\nin the matter was almost as great as mine; and in a day or two we\r\nstarted on our quest.\r\n\r\n\"I easily traced you to San Francisco, and found the hotel at which you\r\nhad stopped. Here I obtained fresh news of you, and learned that you\r\nhad started East, and that the destination of the party was believed to\r\nbe Philadelphia. I had hoped that I should meet with you before you left\r\nCalifornia; but supposing that by that time you had reached your\r\ndestination, or were, at least, far on your way, I yielded to the\r\nsolicitations of my sister and made some excursions in California,\r\nintending then to follow you to Philadelphia, and there to advertise for\r\nMr. Craig, if he could not otherwise be found. However, by the rarest\r\nand most fortunate of chances, we have met thus early, and for this I\r\ncan never be too devoutly thankful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor we,\" said I, earnestly; \"for our greatly desired acquaintance with\r\nyou and your family could not have begun too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Dusante, \"I will perform the duty for which my journey\r\nwas undertaken, and I assure you it is a great pleasure to me to be able\r\nso soon to carry out this cherished purpose.\"\r\n\r\nHe then took up from the floor by his side the package which he had so\r\nsafely guarded during his swift and perilous descent of the\r\nmountain-side, and which he had since kept close by him. Placing this\r\nupon his knee, he removed the light shawl in which it had been rolled,\r\nand then several pieces of wrapping-paper, revealing to our eyes the\r\nfamiliar fat little ginger-jar which had stood on the mantelpiece of the\r\ndining-room in the house on the island, and in which we had deposited\r\nour board money.\r\n\r\n\"It would be simply impossible for me,\" said Mr. Dusante, \"to consent to\r\nretain in my possession money paid for the aid which I involuntarily\r\nrendered to shipwrecked people. Had I been present on the island, that\r\naid would have been most heartily and freely given, and the fact of my\r\nabsence makes no difference whatever in regard to my feelings on the\r\nsubject of your paying for the food and shelter you found at my house.\r\nHaving understood from Mr. Craig's letter that it was Mrs. Lecks who\r\nsuperintended the collection and depositing of the money, I now return\r\nto you, madam, this jar with its contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which,\" said Mrs. Lecks, sitting up very rigidly, with her hands\r\nclasped behind her, \"I don't take. If it had been a day and a night, or\r\neven two nights and over a Sunday, it wouldn't have mattered; but when\r\nme and Mrs. Aleshine—and the rest of the party can speak for\r\nthemselves—stays for weeks and weeks, without leave or license, in a\r\nman's house, we pay our board—of course deductin' services. Good\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"REVEALING THE FAMILIAR FAT LITTLE GINGER-JAR.\"]\r\n\r\nWith that she arose, and walked, very erect, into the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\"It was all very well, Mr. Dusante,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"for you to try\r\nto carry out what you thought was right; but we have our ideas as to\r\nwhat our duty is, an' you have your ideas as to what your duty is, an'\r\nconsciences is even.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said this, she followed her friend.\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante looked surprised and troubled, and he turned toward me. \"My\r\ndear sir,\" said I, \"those two good women are very sensitive in regard to\r\nright and justice, and I think it will be well not to press this subject\r\nupon them. As for my wife and me, neither of us would consent to touch\r\nmoney which was placed in that jar by Mrs. Lecks with the expectation\r\nthat no one but you or one of your family would take it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Mr. Dusante, replacing the wrapping-paper around\r\nthe jar; \"I will drop the subject for the present. But you will allow me\r\nto say, sir, that I also am very sensitive in regard to right and\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the man who had been sent to the railroad-station\r\ncame back, bringing news that a four-horse wagon would shortly be sent\r\nfor us, and also bearing a letter from Mr. Enderton to Ruth. In this\r\nthat gentleman informed his daughter that he was quite well, but that he\r\nhad suffered anxiety on account of her probable hardships in the\r\nabandoned stage-coach. He had hoped, however, that the snow which had\r\nprecluded his return with assistance had fallen lightly in the elevated\r\nposition in which she had been left; and he had trusted also that Mr.\r\nCraig had bethought himself to build a fire somewhere near the coach,\r\nwhere his daughter might be warmed; and that the provisions, of which he\r\nknew an ample quantity had been packed for the trip, had been properly\r\nheated for her and given to her at suitable intervals. This anxiety, he\r\nsaid, had added very much to his own mental disquietude occasioned by\r\nthe violent vituperations and unjust demands of the driver of the\r\nstage-coach, who had seen fit to attack him with all manner of abuse,\r\nand might even have resorted to personal violence had it not been for\r\nthe interference of by-standers and the locking of his room door. He was\r\nnow, however, much relieved by the departure of this driver, and by the\r\nnews that his daughter had reached a place of safety, which, of course,\r\nhe had supposed she would do, her detention having occurred on an\r\nordinary route of travel.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the arrival of the wagon, the adventures of Mrs.\r\nLecks, Mrs. Aleshine, and myself, as well as those of Ruth and her\r\nfather, from the time the one party left America and the other China,\r\nwere related at length to the Dusantes, who showed a deep interest in\r\nevery detail, and asked many questions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dusante, whose nervous equilibrium had been fully restored by her\r\nnight's rest, and who, although feeling a little stiff and bruised, now\r\ndeclared herself quite well, proved to be a very pleasant lady of\r\nfifty-five or thereabouts. She was of a quiet disposition, but her\r\nspeech and manner showed that in former years, at least, she had been a\r\nwoman of society, and I soon found out that she was much interested in\r\nthe study of character. This interest was principally shown in the\r\ndirection of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, whom she evidently looked\r\nupon as most remarkable women. If any of her sentiments were those of\r\nadmiration, however, they were not returned in kind; Mrs. Lecks and\r\nMrs. Aleshine had but a small opinion of her.\r\n\r\n\"There's mother-in-laws, and stepmothers, and real mothers, and\r\ngrandmothers, and sometimes great-grandmothers livin',\" said Mrs. Lecks\r\nto me, apart; \"but though Mr. Dusante may be a well-meanin' man,—and I\r\ndon't doubt he is,—and wishin', I haven't the least reason to\r\ndisbelieve, to do his whole duty by his fellow-men, still I must say,\r\nbein' brought up as I was, he hasn't any right to make a new kind of\r\nmother. To be sure, a man can adopt children, but that isn't goin'\r\nbackward, like this is, which is ag'in' nat'ral law and gospel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, who was with us, \"that them French has\r\ngot fashions that we don't know about, and thankful we ought to be that\r\nwe don't! I never had no patience with French heels an' French\r\narsenic-green beans; an' now, if there's to be adoptin' of mothers in\r\nthis country, the next thing will be gullotynes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see,\" said I, \"why you look upon the Dusantes as French people.\r\nThey are just as much American as French.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"it's not for me and Mrs. Aleshine to set\r\nourselves up to judge other people. In our part of the country we don't\r\nadopt mothers; but if they do it in France, or the Sandwich Islands, or\r\ndown East, I don't know that we ought to have anything to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might as well have adopted a father at the same time,\" said Mrs.\r\nAleshine, \"although, to be sure, he would 'a' had to been particular to\r\ntake one that was acquainted with Mrs. Dusante, and not had 'em\r\nstrangers to each other, though parents to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I was you, Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"I'd adopt some sort\r\nof rag to the top of my head to serve for a bonnet; for here comes the\r\nwagon, and I suppose now we'll be off.\"\r\n\r\nWe took leave of the kind-hearted ranch people, who looked upon us as a\r\ngodsend into their lonely life, and disposed ourselves as comfortably as\r\nwe could in the large wagon. Our journey of seven or eight miles to the\r\nrailroad-station was slow, and over ways that were rough. Mrs. Dusante\r\nwas a delicate woman and not used to hardship, whereas Mrs. Lecks and\r\nMrs. Aleshine were exceedingly vigorous and tough. The consequence of\r\nthis difference was that the kindly hearts of the latter prompted them\r\nto do everything they could to prevent Mrs. Dusante feeling the bumps\r\nand jolts, and to give her such advantages of wraps and position as\r\nwould help her to bear better the fatigues of the journey.\r\n\r\nIn doing this these good women gradually forgot the adopted mother, and\r\ncame to think only of the very pleasant lady who needed their\r\nattentions, and who took such a lively and agreeable interest in their\r\nfamily histories, their homes, their manner of living, and everything\r\nthat pertained to them; and before we reached the end of our trip these\r\nthree were talking together like old friends. Ruth and Miss Lucille had\r\nalso struck up a warm acquaintance, while I found Mr. Dusante a very\r\nentertaining man—of sedate and careful speech, ingenious ideas, and of\r\na very courteous disposition.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the railroad-station we were met by Mr. Enderton, who\r\nshowed a moderate degree of pleasure at seeing us, and an immoderate\r\namount of annoyance, exhibited principally to me, in being obliged to\r\ngive up to the women of our party the large room he had occupied in the\r\nonly lodging-house in the little settlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"RUTH AND MISS LUCILLE STRUCK UP A WARM ACQUAINTANCE.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen I informed him that the strangers with us were the Dusantes, on\r\nwhose island we had been staying, he at first listened vaguely. He had\r\nalways looked upon the Dusante family as a sort of fable used by Mrs.\r\nLecks to countenance her exactions of money from the unfortunate\r\nsojourners on the island. But when I told him what Mr. Dusante had done,\r\nand related how he had brought the board money with him, and had offered\r\nto pay it back to us, an eager interest was aroused in him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder,\" he exclaimed, \"that the conscience-stricken man\r\nwishes to give the money back, but that any one should refuse what\r\nactually belongs to him or her is beyond my comprehension! One thing is\r\ncertain—I shall receive my portion. Fifteen dollars a week for my\r\ndaughter and myself that woman charged me, and I will have it back.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" I said, \"your board was reduced to the same sum as that\r\npaid by the rest of us—four dollars a week each.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call to mind no reduction,\" said Mr. Enderton. \"I remember distinctly\r\nthe exorbitant sum charged me for board on a desert island. It made a\r\ndeep impression upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not care to talk any further on this subject,\" I said. \"You must\r\nsettle it with Mrs. Lecks.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton gave a great sniff, and walked away with dignity. I could\r\nnot but laugh as I imagined his condition two minutes after he had\r\nstated his opinions on this subject to Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Dusante had started from San Francisco on his search for us, he\r\nhad sent his heavy baggage ahead of him to Ogden City, where he purposed\r\nto make his first stop. He supposed that we might possibly here diverge\r\nfrom our homeward-bound route in order to visit the Mormon metropolis;\r\nand, if we had done so, he did not wish to pass us. It was therefore now\r\nagreed that we should all go to Ogden City, and there await the arrival\r\nof our effects left in the snowed-up vehicles on the mountain-side. We\r\nmade arrangements with the station-master that these should be forwarded\r\nto us as soon as the stage-coach and the carriage could be brought down.\r\nAll the baggage of my party was on the coach, and it consisted only of a\r\nfew valises bought in San Francisco, and a package containing two\r\nlife-preservers, which Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine said they would\r\ntake home with them, if they took nothing else.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after our arrival at Ogden City, Mr. Dusante took me\r\naside. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I wish to confide to you my intentions regarding\r\nthe jar containing the money left by your party in my house, and I trust\r\nyou will do nothing to thwart them. When your baggage arrives, you, with\r\nyour party, will doubtless continue your eastern way, and we shall\r\nreturn to San Francisco. But the jar, with its contents, shall be left\r\nbehind to be delivered to Mrs. Lecks. If you will take charge of the\r\njar, and hand it to her, sir, I shall be obliged greatly.\"\r\n\r\nI promised Mr. Dusante that I would not interfere with his intentions,\r\nbut asserted that I could, on no account, take charge of the jar. The\r\npossession of that piece of pottery, with its contents, was now a matter\r\nof dispute between him and Mrs. Lecks, and must be settled by them.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, sir,\" he said. \"I shall arrange to depart before you\r\nand your company, and I shall leave the jar, suitably packed, in the\r\ncare of the clerk of this hotel, with directions to hand it to Mrs.\r\nLecks after I am gone. Thus there will be nothing for her to do but to\r\nreceive it.\"\r\n\r\nSome one now came into the smoking-room, where we were sitting, and no\r\nmore was said on this subject. Mr. Dusante's statement of his intention\r\nvery much amused me, for Mrs. Lecks had previously taken me into her\r\nconfidence in regard to her intentions in this matter. \"Mr. Dusante,\"\r\nshe had said, \"hasn't dropped a word more about the money in that\r\nginger-jar, but I know just as well as he does what he's goin' to do\r\nabout it. When the time comes to go, he's goin' to slip off quietly,\r\nleavin' that jar behind him, thinkin' then I'll be obliged to take it,\r\nthere bein' nobody to give it back to. But he'll find me just as sharp\r\nas he is. I've got the street and number of his business place in\r\nHonolulu from his sister,—askin' about it in an offhand way, as if it\r\ndidn't mean anything,—an' if that jar is left for me, I'll pack it in a\r\nbox, money and all, and I'll express it to Mr. Dusante; and when he gets\r\nto Honolulu he'll find it there, and then he'll know that two can play\r\nat that sort of game.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing Mr. Dusante, and knowing Mrs. Lecks, I pictured to myself a box\r\ncontaining a ginger-jar, and covered with numerous half-obliterated\r\naddresses, traveling backward and forward between the Sandwich Islands\r\nand Pennsylvania during the lifetime of the contestants, and, probably,\r\nif testamentary desires should be regarded, during a great part of the\r\nlifetime of their heirs. That the wear and tear of the box might make it\r\nnecessary to inclose it in a keg, and that, eventually, the keg might\r\nhave to be placed in a barrel, and that, after a time, in a hogshead,\r\nseemed to me as likely as any other contingencies which might befall\r\nthis peregrinating ginger-jar.\r\n\r\nWe spent three days in Ogden City, and then, the weather having\r\nmoderated very much, and the snow on the mountains having melted\r\nsufficiently to allow the vehicles to be brought down, our effects were\r\nforwarded to us, and my party and that of Mr. Dusante prepared to\r\nproceed on our different ways. An eastward-bound train left that\r\nevening an hour after we received our baggage, but we did not care to\r\ndepart upon such short notice, and so determined to remain until the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Dusante came to me to say that he was very glad to\r\nfind that the westward train would leave Ogden City early in the\r\nmorning, so that he and his family would start on their journey some\r\nhours before we should leave. \"This suits my plans exactly,\" he said. \"I\r\nhave left the ginger-jar, securely wrapped, and addressed to Mrs. Lecks,\r\nwith the clerk of the hotel, who will deliver it to-morrow immediately\r\nafter my departure. All our preparations are made, and we purpose this\r\nevening to bid farewell to you and our other kind friends, from whom, I\r\nassure you, we are most deeply grieved to part.\"\r\n\r\nI had just replied that we also regretted extremely the necessity for\r\nthis separation, when a boy brought me a letter. I opened it, and found\r\nit was from Mr. Enderton. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: I have determined not to wait here until to-morrow,\r\n     but to proceed eastward by this evening's train. I desire to\r\n     spend a day in Chicago, and as you and the others will probably\r\n     not wish to stop there, I shall, by this means, attain my\r\n     object without detaining you. My sudden resolution will not\r\n     give me time to see you all before I start, but I have taken a\r\n     hurried leave of my daughter, and this letter will explain\r\n     my departure to the rest.\r\n\r\n     I will also mention that I have thought it proper, as the\r\n     natural head of our party both by age and position, to settle\r\n     the amicable dispute in regard to the reception and disposition\r\n     of the money paid, under an excusable misapprehension, for our\r\n     board and lodging upon a desert island. I discovered that the\r\n     receptacle of this money had been left in the custody of the\r\n     clerk, addressed to Mrs. Lecks, who has not only already\r\n     refused to receive it, and would probably do so again, but who\r\n     is, in my opinion, in no wise entitled to hold, possess, or\r\n     dispose of it. I therefore, without making any disturbance\r\n     whatever, have taken charge of the package, and shall convey it\r\n     with me to Chicago. When you arrive there, I will apportion the\r\n     contents among us according to our several claims. This I\r\n     regard as a very sensible and prudent solution of the little\r\n     difficulty which has confronted us in regard to the disposition\r\n     of this money. Yours hurriedly,\r\n\r\n                                                   DAVID J. ENDERTON.\r\n\r\n     P.S. I shall stop at Brandiger's Hotel, where I shall await\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton's letter astonished and angered me, but in spite of my\r\nindignation, I could not help smiling at the unexpected way in which he\r\nhad put a stop to the probable perpetual peregrinations of the\r\nginger-jar. I handed the letter to Mr. Dusante, and when he had read it\r\nhis face flushed, and I could see that he was very angry, although he\r\nkept his temper under excellent control.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" he said presently, \"this shall not be allowed. That jar, with its\r\ncontents, is my property until Mrs. Lecks has consented to receive it.\r\nIt is of my own option that I return it at all, and I have decided to\r\nreturn it to Mrs. Lecks. Any one interfering with my intentions steps\r\nentirely beyond the line of just and warrantable procedure. Sir, I shall\r\nnot go westward to-morrow morning, but, with my family, will accompany\r\nyou to Chicago, where I shall require Mr. Enderton to return to me my\r\nproperty, which I shall then dispose of as I see fit. You must excuse\r\nme, sir, if anything I have said regarding this gentleman with whom you\r\nare connected has wounded your sensibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't think of that,\" I exclaimed. \"Pitch into Enderton as much as\r\nyou please, and you may be sure that I shall not object. When I took the\r\ndaughter to wife, I did not marry the father. But, of course, for my\r\nwife's sake I hope this matter will not be made the subject of public\r\ncomment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need have no fear of that,\" said Mr. Dusante; \"and you will allow\r\nme to remark that Mr. Enderton's wife must have been a most charming\r\nlady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think so?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I judge so,\" he answered, with a bow, \"from my acquaintance with Mrs.\r\nCraig.\"\r\n\r\nI now went immediately to Ruth, who, I found, knew nothing of what had\r\noccurred, except that her father had gone on to Chicago in advance of\r\nour party, and had had time only to bid her a hasty good-by. I made no\r\nremarks on this haste, which would not allow Mr. Enderton to take leave\r\nof us, but which gave him time to write a letter of some length; and as\r\nRuth knew nothing of this letter, I determined not to mention it to her.\r\nHer father's sudden departure surprised her but little, for she told me\r\nthat he always liked to get to places before the rest of the party with\r\nwhom he might be journeying.\r\n\r\n\"Even when we go to church,\" she said, \"he always walks ahead of the\r\nrest of us. I don't understand why he likes to do so, but this is one of\r\nhis habits.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I informed Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine of what had happened, they\r\nfairly blazed.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what Mr. Dusante calls it,\" exclaimed Mrs. Lecks, \"but I\r\nknow what I call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine, her round eyes sparkling with\r\nexcitement; \"if that isn't ex-honesty, then he ain't no ex-missionary! I\r\npity the heathen he converted!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll convert him,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"if ever I lay eyes on him! Walkin'\r\naway with a package with my name on it! He might as well take my gold\r\nspectacles or my tortoise-shell comb!, I suppose there's no such thing\r\nas ketchin' up with him, but I'll telegraph after him; an' I'll let him\r\nknow that if he dares to open a package of mine, I'll put the law on\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"You kin send telegraphs all along the\r\nline to one station an' another for conductors to give to him in the\r\ncars, an' directed to Mr. Enderton, a tall man with gray-mixed hair an'\r\na stolen bundle. That's the way they did in our place when Abram Marly's\r\nwife fell into the cistern, an' he'd jus' took the cars to the city, an'\r\nthey telegraphed to him at five different stations to know where he'd\r\nleft the ladder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which ain't a bad idea,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"though his name will be\r\nenough on it without no description; an' I'll do that this minute, an'\r\nfind out about the stations from the clerk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be very careful,\" I said, \"about anything of that kind, for\r\nthe telegrams will be read at the stations, and Mr. Enderton might be\r\nbrought into trouble in a way which we all should regret; but a\r\ndespatch may be worded so that he, and no one else, would understand\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"an' let's get at it; but I must say that\r\nhe don't deserve bein' saved no trouble, for I'm as sure as that I'm a\r\nlivin' woman that he never saved nobody else no trouble sence the first\r\nminute he was born.\"\r\n\r\nThe following despatch was concocted and sent on to Bridger, to be\r\ndelivered to Mr. Enderton on the train:\r\n\r\n     The package you know of has been stolen. You will recognize the\r\n     thief. If he leaves it at Chicago hotel, let him go. If he\r\n     opens it, clap him in jail.\r\n\r\n                                                         MRS. LECKS.\r\n\r\n\"I think that will make him keep his fingers off it,\" said Mrs. Lecks;\r\n\"an' if Mr. Dusante chooses to send somethin' of the same kind to some\r\nother station, it won't do no harm. An' if that Enderton gets so skeered\r\nthat he keeps out of sight and hearin' of all of us, it'll be the best\r\nthing that's happened yet. An' I want you to understan', Mr. Craig, that\r\nnothin' 's goin' to be said or done to make your wife feel bad; an'\r\nthere's no need of her hearin' about what's been done or what's goin' to\r\nbe done. But I'll say for her that though, of course, Mr. Enderton is\r\nher father, and she looks up to him as such, she's a mighty deal\r\nlivelier and gayer-hearted when he's away than when he's with her. An'\r\nas for the rest of us, there's no use sayin' anything about our\r\nresignedness to the loss of his company.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"for if there ever was a man who\r\nthought of himself ninety-nine times before he thought of anybody else\r\nonce, an' then as like as not to forgit that once, he's the man. An'\r\nit's not, by no means, that I'm down on missionaries, for it's many a\r\nbox I've made up for 'em, an' never begrudged neither money nor trouble,\r\nan' will do it ag'in many times, I hope. But he oughtn't to be called\r\none, havin' given it up,—unless they gave him up, which there's no\r\nknowin' which it was,—for if there's anything which shows the good in a\r\nman, it's his bein' willin' to give up the comforts of a Christian land\r\nan' go an' convert heathens; though bein' willin' to give up the\r\nheathens an' go for the comforts shows him quite different, besides, as\r\nlike as not, chargin' double, an' only half convertin'.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante was fully determined to go on with us until he had recovered\r\npossession of the ginger-jar. His courteous feelings toward Mrs. Craig\r\nand myself prevented his saying much about Mr. Enderton, but I had good\r\nreason to believe that his opinions in regard to my father-in-law were\r\nnot very different from those of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine. Ever\r\nsince Mr. Enderton had shown his petulant selfishness, when obliged to\r\ngive up his room at the railroad-station for the use of the women of his\r\nparty, Mr. Dusante had looked upon him coldly, and the two had had but\r\nlittle to say to each other.\r\n\r\nWe were all very glad that our pleasant party was not to be broken up;\r\nand although there was no resignation at the absence of the ginger-jar,\r\nwe started on our journey the next day in a pleasanter mood for the\r\nabsence of Mr. Enderton. Before we left, Mr. Dusante sent a telegram to\r\nKearney Junction, to be delivered to Mr. Enderton when he arrived\r\nthere. What this message was I do not know, but I imagine its tone was\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nOur journey to Chicago was a pleasant one. We had now all become very\r\nwell acquainted with each other, and there was no discordant element in\r\nthe combined party. Some of us were a little apprehensive of trouble, or\r\nannoyance at least, awaiting us in Chicago, but we did not speak of it;\r\nand while Ruth knew nothing of her father's misbehavior, it might have\r\nbeen supposed that the rest had forgotten it.\r\n\r\nAt Chicago we went at once to Brandiger's Hotel, and there we found,\r\ninstead of Mr. Enderton, a letter from him to Ruth. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR DAUGHTER: I have determined not to wait here, as\r\n     originally intended, but to go on by myself. I am sorry not to\r\n     meet you here, but it will not be long before we are together\r\n     again, and you know I do not like to travel with a party. Its\r\n     various members always incommode me in one way or another. I\r\n     had proposed to go to Philadelphia and wait for you there, but\r\n     have since concluded to stop at Meadowville, a village in the\r\n     interior of Pennsylvania, where, as they have informed me, the\r\n     two women, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, reside. I wish to see\r\n     the party all together before I take final leave of them, and I\r\n     suppose the two women will not consent to go any farther than\r\n     the country town in which they live. Inclosed is a note to your\r\n     husband relating to business matters. I hope that he will take\r\n     the best of care of you during the rest of the journey, and\r\n     thus very much oblige\r\n\r\n                                         YOUR AFFECTIONATE FATHER.\r\n\r\nThis was my note:\r\n\r\n     MR. CRAIG. SIR: I should have supposed that you would have been\r\n     able to prevent the insolent messages which have been\r\n     telegraphed to me from some members of your party, but it is\r\n     my lot to be disappointed in those in whom I trust. I shall\r\n     make no answer to these messages, but will say to you that I am\r\n     not to be browbeaten in my intention to divide among its\r\n     rightful claimants the money now in my possession. It is not\r\n     that I care for the comparatively paltry sum that will fall to\r\n     myself and my daughter, but it is the principle of the matter\r\n     for which I am contending. It was due to me that the amount\r\n     should have been returned to me, and to no other, that I might\r\n     make the proper division. I therefore rest upon my principles\r\n     and my rights; and, desiring to avoid needless altercations,\r\n     shall proceed to Meadowville, where, when the rest of my party\r\n     arrive, I shall justly apportion the money. I suppose the man\r\n     Dusante will not be foolish enough to protract his useless\r\n     journey farther than Chicago. It is your duty to make him see\r\n     the impropriety of so doing. Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                   D. J. ENDERTON.\r\n\r\nRuth's letter was shown to all the party, and mine in private to Mr.\r\nDusante, Mrs. Lecks, and Mrs. Aleshine. When the first moments of\r\nastonishment were over, Mrs. Lecks exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Well, after all, I don't know that I'm so very sorry that the old sneak\r\nhas done this, for now we're rid of him for the rest of the trip; and\r\nI'm pretty certain, from the way he writes, that he hasn't dipped into\r\nthat jar yet. We've skeered him from doin' that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the impidence of him!\" said Mrs. Aleshine. \"Think of his goin' to\r\nthe very town where we live an' gittin' there fust! He'll be settin' on\r\nthat tavern porch, with every loafer in the place about him, an' tellin'\r\n'em the whole story of what happened to us from beginnin' to end, till\r\nby the time we git there it'll be all over the place an' as stale as\r\nlast week's bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"'The man Dusante,'\" quietly remarked that individual, \"will not\r\nabandon the purpose of his journey. He left his island to place in the\r\nhands of Mrs. Lecks, on behalf of her party, the ginger-jar with the\r\nmoney inclosed. He will therefore go on with you to Meadowville, and\r\nwill there make formal demand, and, if necessary, legal requisition, for\r\nthe possession of that jar and that money; after which he will proceed\r\nto carry out his original intentions.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THE IMPIDENCE OF HIM!'\"]\r\n\r\nWe all expressed our pleasure at having him, with his ladies, as\r\ncompanions for the remainder of our journey, and Mrs. Lecks immediately\r\noffered them the hospitalities of her house for as long a time as they\r\nmight wish to stay with her.\r\n\r\n\"The weather there,\" she said, \"is often splendid till past Thanksgivin'\r\nday, an' nobody could be welcomer than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd have asked you myself,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"if Mrs. Lecks hadn't\r\ndone it,—which of course she would, bein' alive,—but I'm goin' to have\r\nMr. Craig an' his wife, an' as our houses is near, we'll see each other\r\nall the time. An' if Mr. Enderton chooses to stay awhile at the tavern,\r\nhe can come over to see his daughter whenever he likes. I'll go as fur\r\nas that, though no further can I go. I'm not the one to turn anybody\r\nfrom my door, be he heathen, or jus' as bad, or wuss. But tea once, or\r\nperhaps twice, is all that I can find it in my heart to offer that man\r\nafter what he's done.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Dusantes and Ruth expressed a desire to see something of Chicago,\r\nwhere they had never been before, we remained in this city for two days,\r\nfeeling that, as Mr. Enderton would await our coming, there was no\r\nnecessity for haste.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon of the second day I went into the parlor of the\r\nhotel, where I expected to find our party prepared for a sight-seeing\r\nexcursion; but I found the room tenanted only by Mrs. Aleshine, who was\r\nsitting with her bonnet and wraps on, ready to start forth. I had said\r\nbut a few words to her when Mrs. Lecks entered, without bonnet or shawl,\r\nand with her knitting in her hand. She took a seat in a large\r\neasy-chair, put on her spectacles, and proceeded to knit.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lecks!\" exclaimed her friend, in surprise, \"don't you intend goin'\r\nout this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Lecks. \"I've seen all I want to see, an' I'm goin' to\r\nstay in the house an' keep quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Mr. Dusante goin' out this afternoon?\" asked Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks laid her knitting in her lap; then she took off her\r\nspectacles, folded them, and placed them beside the ball of yarn, and,\r\nturning her chair around, she faced her friend. \"Barb'ry Aleshine,\" said\r\nshe, speaking very deliberately, \"has any such a thing got into your\r\nmind as that I'm settin' my cap at Mr. Dusante?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say you have, an' I don't say you haven't,\" answered Mrs.\r\nAleshine, her fat hands folded on her knees, and her round face shining\r\nfrom under her new bonnet with an expression of hearty good will; \"but\r\nthis I will say,—an' I don't care who hears it,—that if you was to set\r\nyour cap at Mr. Dusante, there needn't nobody say anythin' ag'in' it, so\r\nlong as you are content. He isn't what I'd choose for you, if I had the\r\nchoosin', for I'd git one with an American name an' no islands. But\r\nthat's neither here nor there, for you're a grown woman an' can do your\r\nown choosin'. An' whether there's any choosin' to be done is your own\r\nbusiness, too, for it's full eleven years sence you've been done with\r\nwidder fixin's; an' if Mr. Lecks was to rise up out of his grave this\r\nminute, he couldn't put his hand on his heart an' say that you hadn't\r\ndone your full duty by him, both before an' after he was laid away. An'\r\nso, if you did want to do choosin', an' made up your mind to set your\r\ncap at Mr. Dusante, there's no word to be said. Both of you is ripe-aged\r\nan' qualified to know your own minds, an' both of you is well off\r\nenough, to all intents an' purposes, to settle down together, if so\r\ninclined. An' as to his sister, I don't expect she will be on his hands\r\nfor long. An' if you can put up with an adopted mother-in-law, that's\r\nyour business, not mine; though I allus did say, Mrs. Lecks, that if\r\nyou'd been 'Piscopalian, you'd been Low-church.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the other; \"it's all I have to say jus' now, though more\r\nmight come to me if I gave my mind to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"I've somethin' to say on this p'int, and\r\nI'm very glad Mr. Craig is here to hear it. If I had a feelin' in the\r\ndirection of Mr. Dusante that he was a man, though not exactly what I\r\nmight wish, havin' somethin' of foreign manners, with ties in the\r\nSandwich Islands, which I shouldn't have had so if I'd had the orderin'\r\nof it, who was still a Christian gentleman,—as showed by his acts, not\r\nhis words,—a lovin' brother, an' a kind an' attentive son by his own\r\nadoption, and who would make me a good husband for the rest of our two\r\nlives, then I'd go and I'd set my cap at him—not bold nor flauntin' nor\r\nunbecomin' to a woman of my age, but just so much settin' of it at him\r\nthat if he had any feelin's in my direction, and thought, although it\r\nwas rather late in life for him to make a change, that if he was goin'\r\nto do it he'd rather make that change with a woman who had age enough,\r\nand experience enough, in downs as well as ups, and in married life as\r\nwell as single, to make him feel that as he got her so he'd always find\r\nher, then I say all he'd have to do would be to come to me an' say what\r\nhe thought, an' I'd say what I thought, an' the thing would be settled,\r\nan' nobody in this world need have one word to say, except to wish us\r\njoy, an' then go along and attend to their own business.\r\n\r\n\"But now I say to you, Barb'ry Aleshine, an' just the same to you, Mr.\r\nCraig, that I haven't got no such feelin's in the direction of Mr.\r\nDusante, an' I don't intend to set my cap at him; an' if he wore such a\r\nthing, and set it at me, I'd say to him, kind, though firm, that he\r\ncould put it straight again as far as I was concerned, an' that if he\r\nchose to set it at any other woman, if the nearest an' dearest friend I\r\nhave on earth, I'd do what I could to make their married lives as happy\r\nas they could be under the circumstances, and no matter what happened, I\r\nwouldn't say one word, though I might think what I pleased. An' now you\r\nhave it, all straight and plain: if I wanted to set caps, I'd set 'em;\r\nand if I didn't want to set 'em, I wouldn't. I don't want to, and I\r\ndon't.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, putting on her spectacles, she resumed her knitting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Aleshine turned upon her friend a beaming face.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lecks,\" she said, \"your words has lifted a load from off my mind.\r\nIt wouldn't ha' broke me down, an' you wouldn't never have knowed I\r\ncarried it; but it's gone, an' I'm mighty glad of it. An' as for me an'\r\nmy cap,—an' when you spoke of nearest and dearest friends you couldn't\r\nmean nobody but me,—you needn't be afraid. No matter what I was, nor\r\nwhat he was, nor what I thought of him, nor what he thought of me, I\r\ncouldn't never say to my son, when he comes to his mother's arms all the\r\nway from Japan: 'George, here's a Frenchman who I give to you for a\r\nfather!'\"\r\n\r\nHere I burst out laughing; but Mrs. Lecks gravely remarked: \"Now I hope\r\nthis business of cap-settin' is settled an' done with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which it is,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, as she rose to meet the rest of our\r\nparty as they entered the room.\r\n\r\nFor several days I could not look upon the dignified and almost courtly\r\nMr. Dusante without laughing internally, and wondering what he would\r\nthink if he knew how, without the slightest provocation on his side, a\r\nmatrimonial connection with him had been discussed by these good women,\r\nand how the matter had been finally settled. I think he would have\r\nconsidered this the most surprising incident in the whole series of his\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nOn our journey from Chicago to the little country town in the interior\r\nof Pennsylvania we made a few stops at points of interest for the sake\r\nof Ruth and the Dusante ladies, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine generously\r\nconsenting to these delays, although I knew they felt impatient to reach\r\ntheir homes. They were now on most social terms with Mrs. Dusante, and\r\nthe three chatted together like old friends.\r\n\r\n\"I asked her if we might call her Emily,\" said Mrs. Aleshine in\r\nconfidence to me, \"an' she said yes, an' we're goin' to do it. I've all\r\nalong wanted to, because it seemed to come nat'ral, considerin' we\r\nknowed 'em as Emily and Lucille before we set eyes on 'em. But as long\r\nas I had that load on my mind about Mrs. Lecks and Mr. Dusante I\r\ncouldn't 'Emily' his adopted mother. My feelin's wouldn't ha' stood it.\r\nBut now it's all right; an' though Emily isn't the woman I expected her\r\nto be, Lucille is the very picter of what I thought she was. And as for\r\nEmily, I never knowed a nicer-mannered lady, an' more willin' to learn\r\nfrom people that's had experience, than she is.\"\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Meadowville early in the afternoon, and when our party\r\nalighted from the train we were surprised not to see Mr. Enderton on the\r\nplatform of the little station. Instead of him, there stood three\r\npersons whose appearance amazed and delighted us. They were the\r\nred-bearded coxswain and the two sailormen, all in neat new clothes, and\r\nwith their hands raised in maritime salute.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of joy. Mrs. Aleshine dropped her bag and umbrella, and\r\nrushed toward them with outstretched hands. In a moment Mrs. Lecks,\r\nRuth, and myself joined the group, and greeted warmly our nautical\r\ncompanions of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Dusante party, when they were made acquainted with the mariners,\r\nwere almost as much delighted as we were, and Mr. Dusante expressed in\r\ncordial words his pleasure in meeting the other members of the party to\r\nwhom his island had given refuge.\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad to see you,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"that I don't know my\r\nbonnet from my shoes! But how, in the name of all that's wonderful, did\r\nyou get here?\"\r\n\r\n\"'T ain't much of a story,\" said the coxswain, \"an' this is just the\r\nwhole of it. When you left us at 'Frisco we felt pretty downsome, an'\r\nthe more that way because we couldn't find no vessel that we cared to\r\nship on; an' then there come to town the agent of the house that owned\r\nour brig, and we was paid off for our last v'yage. Then, when we had\r\nfitted ourselves out with new togs, we began to think different about\r\nthis shippin' on board a merchant-vessel, an' gettin' cussed at, an'\r\nlivin' on hard-tack an' salt prog, an' jus' as like as not the ship\r\nspringin' a leak an' all hands pumpin' night an' day, an' goin' to Davy\r\nJones, after all. An' after talkin' this all over, we was struck hard on\r\nthe weather-bow with a feelin' that it was a blamed sight\r\nbetter—beggin' your pardon, ma'am—to dig garden-beds in nice soft\r\ndirt, an' plant peas, an' ketch fish, an' all that kind of shore work,\r\nan' eatin' them good things you used to cook for us, Mrs. Aleshine, and\r\ndancin' hornpipes for ye, and tamin' birds when our watch was off.\r\nWasn't that so, Jim an' Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said the black-bearded sailormen.\r\n\r\n\"Then says I, 'Now look here, mates; don't let's go and lark away all\r\nthis money, but take it an' make a land trip to where Mrs. Aleshine\r\nlives'—which port I had the name of on a piece of paper which you gave\r\nme, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here Mrs. Aleshine nodded vigorously, not being willing to interrupt\r\nthis entrancing story.\r\n\r\n\"'An' if she's got another garden, an' wants it dug in, an' things\r\nplanted, an' fish caught, an' any other kind of shore work done, why,\r\nwe're the men for her; an' we'll sign the papers for as long a v'yage as\r\nshe likes, and stick by her in fair weather or foul, bein' good for day\r\nwork an' night work, an' allus ready to fall in when she passes the\r\nword.' Ain't that so, Jim an' Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" returned the sailormen, with sonorous earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word!\" cried Mrs. Aleshine, tears of joy running down her\r\ncheeks, \"them papers shall be signed, if I have to work night an' day to\r\nfind somethin' for you to do. I've got a man takin' keer of my place\r\nnow; but many a time have I said to myself that if I had anybody I could\r\ntrust to do the work right, I'd buy them two fields of Squire Ramsey's,\r\nan' go into the onion business. An' now you sailormen has come like\r\nthree sea angels, an' if it suits you we'll go into the onion business\r\non sheers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That suits us tiptop, ma'am,\" said the coxswain; \"an' we'll plant\r\ninyans for ye on the shears, on the stocks, or in the dry-dock. It don't\r\nmake no dif'rence to us where you have 'em; just pass the word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"I don't know how that's goin' to work,\r\nbut we won't talk about it now. An' so you came straight on to this\r\nplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"That did we, ma'am,\" said the coxswain. \"An' when we got here we found\r\nthe parson, but none of you folks. That took us aback a little at fust,\r\nbut he said he didn't live here, an' you was comin' pretty soon. An' so\r\nwe took lodgin's at the tavern, an' for three days we've been down here\r\nto meet every train, expectin' you might be on it.\"\r\n\r\nOur baggage had been put on the platform, the train had moved on, and we\r\nhad stood engrossed in the coxswain's narrative; but now I thought it\r\nnecessary to make a move. There was but one small vehicle to hire at the\r\nstation. This would hold but two persons, and in it I placed Mrs.\r\nDusante and Ruth, the first being not accustomed to walking, and the\r\nlatter very anxious to meet her father. I ordered the man to drive them\r\nto the inn, where we would stay until Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine'\r\nshould get their houses properly aired and ready for our reception.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Craig will be glad to get to the tavern and see her father,\" said\r\nMrs. Aleshine. \"I expect he forgot all about its bein' time for the\r\ntrain to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, ma'am!\" exclaimed the coxswain, \"is she gone to the tavern?\r\nThe parson's not there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he, then?\" asked Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"He's at your house, ma'am,\" replied the coxswain.\r\n\r\n\"An' what, in the name of common sense, is he doin' at my house?\"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, her eyes sparkling with amazement and\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ma'am, for one thing,\" said the coxswain, \"he's had the front\r\ndoor painted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, in one breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the coxswain; \"the parson said he hated to see men\r\nhangin' around doin' nothin'. An' then he looked about, an' said the\r\npaint was all wore off the front door, an' we might as well go to work\r\nan' paint that; an' he sent Jim to a shop to git the paint an'\r\nbrushes—\"\r\n\r\n\"An' have 'em charged to me?\" cried Mrs. Aleshine.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" continued the coxswain. \"An' Jim an' Bill holystoned all\r\nthe old paint off the door, an' I painted it, havin' done lots of that\r\nsort of thing on shipboard; an' I think it's a pretty good job,\r\nma'am—red at top and bottom, an' white in the middle, like a steamer's\r\nsmoke-stack.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine looked at each other. \"An' he told you to\r\ndo that?\" said Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" answered the coxswain. \"The parson said he never liked to\r\nbe nowhere without doin' what good he could. An' there was some other\r\npaintin' he talked of havin' done, but we ain't got at it yet. I s'posed\r\nhe was actin' under your orders, an' I hope I haven't done no wrong,\r\nma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not a bit to blame,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"but I'll look into\r\nthis thing. No fear about that! An' how did he come to go to my house?\r\nAn' how did he get in, I'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I know about that,\" said the coxswain, \"is what the gal that's\r\nlivin' there told me, which she did along of askin' us if we was comin'\r\nto live there too, an' if she should rig up beds for us somewhere in the\r\ntop-loft; but we told her no, not havin' no orders, an' payin' our own\r\nway at the tavern. She said, said she, that the parson come there, an'\r\n'lowed he was a friend of Mrs. Aleshine's an' travelin' with her, an'\r\nthat if she was at home she wouldn't let him stay at no tavern; an'\r\nthat, knowin' her wishes, he'd come right there, an' 'spected to be took\r\ncare of till she come. She said she felt uncertain about it, but she\r\ntuck him in till she could think it over, an' then we come an' certified\r\nthat he was the parson who'd been along with Mrs. Aleshine an' the rest\r\nof us. Arter that she thought it was all right, an', beggin' your pardon\r\nif we was wrong, so did Jim an' Bill an' me, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, \"if that isn't exactly like Elizabeth\r\nGrootenheimer! To think of Elizabeth Grootenheimer thinkin'! The\r\nGrootenheimers always was the dumbest family in the township, an'\r\nElizabeth Grootenheimer is the dumbest of 'em all! I did say to myself,\r\nwhen I went away: 'Now, Elizabeth Grootenheimer is so stone dumb that\r\nshe'll jus' stay here an' do the little I tell her to do, an' hasn't\r\nsense enough to get into no mischief.' An' now, look at her!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand in the direction of the invisible Elizabeth\r\nGrootenheimer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks had said very little during this startling communication, but\r\nher face had assumed a stern and determined expression. Now she spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I guess we've heard about enough, an' we'd better be steppin' along an'\r\nsee what else Mr. Enderton an' Elizabeth Grootenheimer is doin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe homes of Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine were not far from each other,\r\nand were situated about midway between the station and the village inn,\r\nand in the direction of these our party now started. Mrs. Aleshine,\r\ncontrary to her custom, took the lead, and walked away with strides of\r\nunusual length. Mrs. Lecks was close behind her, followed by the two\r\nDusantes and myself, while the three mariners, who insisted upon\r\ncarrying all the hand-baggage, brought up the rear. We stepped quickly,\r\nfor we were all much interested in what might happen next; and very soon\r\nwe reached Mrs. Aleshine's house. It was a good-sized and\r\npleasant-looking dwelling, painted white, with green shutters, and with\r\na long covered piazza at the front. Between the road and the house was a\r\nneat yard with grass and flower-beds, and from the gate of the\r\npicket-fence in front of the yard a brick-paved path led up to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOur approach had been perceived, for on the piazza, in front of the\r\ngaily painted door, stood Mr. Enderton, erect, and with a bland and\r\nbenignant smile upon his face. One hand was stretched out as if in\r\nwelcome, and with the other he gracefully held the ginger-jar, now\r\ndivested of its wrappings.\r\n\r\nAt this sight Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine made a simultaneous dash at\r\nthe gate; but it was locked. The two women stamped their feet in fury.\r\n\r\n\"Put down that jar!\" shouted Mrs. Lecks.\r\n\r\n\"Elizabeth Grootenheimer! Elizabeth Grootenheimer!\" screamed Mrs.\r\nAleshine. \"Come here and open this gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Break it down!\" said Mrs. Lecks, turning to the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Aleshine, throwing herself in front of\r\nit. \"Don't you break my gate! Elizabeth Grootenheimer!\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said Mr. Enderton, in clear, distinct tones, \"be calm. I\r\nhave the key of that gate in my pocket. I locked it because I feared\r\nthat on your first arrival you would hurry up to the house in a\r\npromiscuous way, and give heed to irrelevant matters. I wished to\r\naddress you in a body, and in a position where your attention would not\r\nbe diverted from me. I hold here, my friends, the receptacle containing\r\nthe money which, under a misapprehension, was paid for our board while\r\non a desert island. This money I have taken care of, and have carefully\r\nguarded for the benefit of us all. Unfortunately, objections have arisen\r\nto this guardianship, which were forwarded to me by telegraph; but I\r\nhave not heeded them. If you cannot see for yourselves the propriety of\r\nmy assumption of this trust, I will not now undertake to enlighten you.\r\nBut I hope there is no necessity for this, for, having had time to give\r\nthe matter your fullest attention, I doubt not that you entirely agree\r\nwith me. I will merely add, for I see you are impatient, that the sum\r\nwhich will fall to the share of each of us is comparatively\r\ninsignificant and in itself not worth striving for; but what I have done\r\nhas been for the sake of principle. For the sake of principle I have\r\ninsisted that this money should be received by its rightful owners; for\r\nthe sake of principle I assumed the custody of it; and for the sake of\r\nprinciple I shall now empty the contents of this jar—which by me has\r\nnot been examined or touched—upon the floor of this piazza, and I shall\r\nthen proceed to divide said contents into five suitable portions—the\r\nthree mariners, as I understand, having paid no board. The gate can then\r\nbe opened, and each one can come forward and take the portion which\r\nbelongs to him or to her. The portion of my daughter, whom I saw pass\r\nhere in a carriage, going, doubtless, to the inn, will be taken charge\r\nof by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You man!\" shrieked Mrs. Lecks, shaking her fist over the fence, \"if you\r\nas much as lift that paper of fish-hooks from out the top of that\r\nginger-jar, I'll—\"\r\n\r\nHere she was interrupted by the loud, clear voice of Mr. Dusante, who\r\ncalled out: \"Sir, I require you to put down that jar, which is my\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll let you know,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"that other people have\r\nprinciples!\"\r\n\r\nBut what more she said was drowned by the voice of Mrs. Aleshine, who\r\nscreamed for Elizabeth Grootenheimer, and who was now so much excited\r\nthat she was actually trying to break open her own gate.\r\n\r\nI called out to Mr. Enderton not to make trouble by disturbing the\r\ncontents of the jar; and even Miss Lucille, who was intensely amused at\r\nthe scene, could be heard joining her voice to the general clamor.\r\n\r\nBut the threats and demands of our united party had no effect upon Mr.\r\nEnderton. He stood up, serene and bland, fully appreciating the\r\nadvantage of having the key of the gate's padlock in his pocket and the\r\nginger-jar in his hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'YOU MAN!' SHRIEKED MRS. LECKS.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I will now proceed,\" said he. But at that moment his attention was\r\nattracted by the three mariners, who had clambered over the pointed\r\npales of the fence, and who now appeared on the piazza, Bill to the\r\nright hand of Mr. Enderton, Jim to the left, and the red-bearded\r\ncoxswain at his back. They all seemed to speak at once, though what they\r\nsaid we could not hear, nothing but a few hoarse mutterings coming down\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nBut in consequence of what Bill said, Mr. Enderton handed him the key of\r\nthe gate; and in consequence of what Jim said, Mr. Enderton delivered to\r\nhim the ginger-jar; and in consequence of what the coxswain said, he and\r\nMr. Enderton walked off the piazza; and the two proceeded to a distant\r\ncorner of the yard, where they stood out of the way, as it were, while\r\nthe gate was opened. Bill bungled a little, but the padlock was soon\r\nremoved, and we all hurried through the gate and up to the piazza, where\r\nJim still stood, the ginger-jar held reverently in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe coxswain now left Mr. Enderton, and that gentleman proceeded to the\r\nopen gate, through which he passed into the road, and then turned, and\r\nin a loud and severe tone addressed Mrs. Aleshine:\r\n\r\n\"I leave your inhospitable house, and go to join my daughter at the inn,\r\nwhere I request you to send my valise and umbrella as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Aleshine's indignation at this invasion of her home and this\r\ntrampling on her right to open her own gate had entirely driven away her\r\naccustomed geniality, and in angry tones she cried:\r\n\r\n\"Jus' you stop at that paint-shop, when you git to the village, an' pay\r\nfor the paint you had charged to me; an' when you've done that you can\r\nsend for your things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Barb'ry,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"don't let your feelin's run away\r\nwith you. You ought to be thankful that he's let you off so easy, an'\r\nthat he's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all that,\" said Mrs. Aleshine; \"an', on second thoughts, every\r\nwhip-stitch of his bag and baggage shall be trundled after him as soon\r\nas I kin git it away.\"\r\n\r\nWe all now stood upon the piazza, and Mrs. Aleshine, in calmer tones,\r\nbut with her face still flushed from her recent excitement, turned to us\r\nand said: \"Now, isn't this a pretty comin' home? My front gate fastened\r\nin my very face; my front door painted red and white; the inside of the\r\nhouse, as like as not, turned upside down by that man jus' as much as\r\nthe outside; an' where in the world, I'd like to know, is Elizabeth\r\nGrootenheimer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't you be too hard on her,\" said Mrs. Lecks, \"after havin' been\r\naway from her so long. I haven't a doubt she's feedin' the pigs; and you\r\nknow very well she never would leave them as long as she felt they\r\nneeded her. You needn't mind if your house is upset, for none of us is\r\ncomin' in, havin' only intended to see you to your door, which I must\r\nsay is a pretty blazin' one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, Mrs. Lecks,\" said Mr. Dusante, taking, as he spoke, the\r\nginger-jar from the hand of Jim, \"I think this is a suitable opportunity\r\nfor me to accomplish the object for which my present journey was\r\nundertaken, and to return to you the contents of this jar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which,\" said Mrs. Lecks, in a very decided tone, \"I don't take now no\r\nmore'n I did before.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante looked surprised and troubled. After all the dangers and\r\nadventures through which that ginger-jar had gone, I believe that he\r\nexpected Mrs. Lecks would at last relent and consent to accept it from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Now, look here,\" said Mrs. Aleshine, \"don't let us have any more fuss\r\nabout the ginger-jar, or anything else. Let's put off talkin' about that\r\ntill we're all settled and fixed. It won't do for you to take the jar to\r\nthe tavern with you, Mr. Dusante, for like as not Mr. Enderton will git\r\nhold of it ag'in, an' I know Mrs. Lecks won't let it come into her\r\nhouse; so, if you like, you may jus' leave it here for the present, and\r\nyou may make up your minds nobody'll touch it while I'm about. An' about\r\nI intend to be.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was gladly agreed upon, and the jar being delivered to\r\nMrs. Aleshine, we took our leave of her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks found no difficulty in entering her gate, where she was duly\r\nwelcomed by a man and his wife she had left in charge, while the\r\nDusantes and myself walked on to the inn, or \"Hotel,\" as its sign\r\nimported, about which the greater part of the little town clustered. The\r\nthree mariners remained behind to await further orders from Mrs.\r\nAleshine.\r\n\r\nBy the afternoon of the next day the abodes of those two most energetic\r\nand capable housewives, Mrs. Lecks and Mrs. Aleshine, were fully\r\nprepared for the reception of their visitors, and the Dusante family\r\nwere ensconced beneath the roof of the one, while my wife and I were\r\nmost warmly welcomed at the gaily adorned door of the other.\r\n\r\nMr. Enderton remained at the inn, where he found very comfortable\r\nquarters, an arrangement satisfactory to all parties.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Aleshine's dwelling, where, from the very first, Lucille took\r\nher position as a most constant visitor, being equally welcomed by Ruth\r\nand the mistress of the house, all was satisfaction and high good humor.\r\nThe ceaseless activity and cheerful spirits of our hostess seemed to\r\nanimate us all. At Mrs. Lecks's home the case was different. There, I\r\ncould plainly see, there was a certain uneasiness amounting almost to\r\nstiffness between Mrs. Lecks and Mr. Dusante. The latter had not\r\naccomplished the purpose for which he had made this long journey; and\r\nthough, if things had turned out as he wished, he would have been very\r\nglad to be the guest of Mrs. Lecks, still, under the present\r\ncircumstances, the situation did not suit him. Mrs. Lecks, too,\r\npossessed an unsettled mind. She did not know when Mr. Dusante would\r\nagain endeavor to force back upon her the board money in the ginger-jar,\r\nand in this state of uneasy expectancy she was not at her best.\r\n\r\n\"He's not satisfied,\" said she to me, on the morning after the Dusantes\r\nhad come to her; \"he wants to do somethin', or else to go away. I wish\r\nthat ginger-jar had dropped into the bottom of the sea while he was\r\nbringin' it, or else had smashed itself into a thousand bits while he\r\nwas slidin' down the mountain, and the money had melted itself into the\r\nsnow. S'posin' at the end of the week he was to come to me and offer to\r\npay me board for himself and his family, sayin' that was no more than\r\nI'd done to him! Of course the two cases are not a bit alike; for we\r\nwent to his house strangers, without leave or license, while he comes to\r\nmine as a friend, bein' fully invited and pressed. But I don't suppose I\r\ncould make him see it in that light, and it worries me.\"\r\n\r\nI was convinced that something ought to be done to end this unpleasant\r\nstate of affairs, and I took my wife and Miss Lucille into council on\r\nthe subject. After we had deliberated a little while an idea came to\r\nRuth.\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion,\" said she, \"the best thing we can do with that board\r\nmoney is to give it to those three sailors. They are poor and will be\r\nglad to get it; Mr. Dusante and Mrs. Lecks ought to be fully satisfied,\r\nfor the one doesn't keep it and the other doesn't take it back; and I'm\r\nsure that this plan will please all the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition was agreed to by the council, and I was appointed to go\r\nimmediately and lay it before the parties interested.\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante gave his ready consent to this proposal. \"It is not what I\r\nintended to do,\" said he, \"but it amounts to almost the same thing. The\r\nmoney is in fact restored to its owners, and they agree to make a\r\ncertain disposition of it. I am satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lecks hesitated a little. \"All right,\" said she. \"He takes the\r\nmoney and gives it to who he chooses. I've nothin' to say against it.\"\r\n\r\nOf course no opposition to the plan was to be expected from anybody\r\nelse, except Mr. Enderton. But when I mentioned it to him, I found, to\r\nmy surprise, that he was not unwilling to agree to it. Half closing the\r\nbook he had been reading, he said: \"What I have done was on behalf of\r\nprinciple. I did not believe, and do not believe, that upon an entirely\r\ndeserted island money should be paid for board. I paid it under protest,\r\nand I do not withdraw that protest. According to all the laws of justice\r\nand hospitality, the man who owned that island should not retain that\r\nmoney, and Mrs. Lecks had no right to insist upon such retention. But if\r\nit is proposed to give the sum total to three mariners who paid no\r\nboard, and to whom the gift is an absolute charity, I am content. To be\r\nsure, they interfered with me at a moment when I was about to make a\r\nsuitable settlement of the matter, but I have no doubt they were told to\r\ndo so; and I must admit that while they carried out their orders with a\r\ncertain firmness, characteristic of persons accustomed to unreasoning\r\nobedience, they treated me with entire respect. If equal respect had\r\nbeen shown to me at the beginning of these disputes, it would have been\r\nmuch better for all concerned.\"\r\n\r\nAnd opening his book, he recommenced his reading.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon all of us, except Mr. Enderton, assembled on Mrs.\r\nAleshine's piazza to witness the presentation of the board money. The\r\nthree sailors, who had been informed of the nature of the proceedings,\r\nstood in line on the second step of the piazza, clad in their best\r\ntoggery, and with their new tarpaulin hats in their hands. Mrs. Aleshine\r\nwent into the house, and soon reappeared carrying the ginger-jar, which\r\nshe presented to Mr. Dusante. That gentleman took it, and stood holding\r\nit for a moment as if he were about to speak; but even if he had\r\nintended to say anything, he had no further opportunity, for Mrs. Lecks\r\nnow stepped forward and addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dusante,\" said she, \"from what I have seen of you myself and heard\r\ntell of you from others, I believe you are a man who tries to do his\r\nduty, as he sees it, with a single heart and no turnin' from one side to\r\nthe other. You made up your mind that you'd travel over the whole world,\r\nif it had to be done, with that ginger-jar and the board money inside of\r\nit, till you'd found the people who'd been livin' in your house; and\r\nthen that you'd give back that jar, jus' as you'd found it, to the\r\nperson who took upon herself the overseein' of the reg'lar payin' of the\r\nmoney and the puttin' of it therein. With that purpose in your mind you\r\ncarried that jar over the ocean; you wandered with it up and down\r\nCalifornia; and holdin' it tight fast in your arms, you slid down the\r\nslipperiest mountain that was ever made yet, I believe, and if it had\r\nbeen your only infant child, you couldn't have held it firmer, nor\r\nregarded it more careful. Through ups and downs, and thicks and smooths,\r\nyou carried that jar or followed it, and for the sake of doin' what\r\nyou'd set your mind on you came all the way to this place; to which, if\r\nit hadn't been for that one idea, it isn't likely you'd ever dreamed of\r\ncomin'. Now, Mr. Dusante, we've all agreed on what we think is the right\r\nthing to do, and you agreed with us, but I can see by your face that\r\nyou're disapp'inted. The thing you set out to do you haven't done; and\r\nI'm not goin' to have it to say to myself that you was the only one of\r\nall of us that wasn't satisfied, and that I was the stumblin'-block\r\nthat stood in your way. So I'll back down from sayin' that I'd never\r\ntouch that jar again, and you can put it into my hands, as you set out\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante made no answer, but stepped forward, and taking Mrs. Lecks's\r\nlarge brown and work-worn hand, he respectfully touched it with his\r\nlips. It is not probable that Mrs. Lecks's hand had ever before been\r\nkissed. It is not probable that she had ever seen any one kiss the hand\r\nof another. But the hard sense and keen insight of that independent\r\ncountrywoman made her instantly aware of what was meant by that\r\nold-fashioned act of courteous homage. Her tall form grew more erect;\r\nshe slightly bowed her head, and received the salute with a quiet\r\ndignity which would have become a duchess.\r\n\r\nThis little scene touched us all, and Mrs. Aleshine afterward informed\r\nme that for a moment she hadn't a dry eye in her head.\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante now handed the ginger-jar to Mrs. Lecks, who immediately\r\nstepped toward Ruth and Lucille.\r\n\r\n\"You two young ones,\" she said, \"can jus' take this jar, an' your hands\r\ncan be the first to lift off that paper of fish-hooks and take out the\r\nmoney, which you will then divide among our good friends, these\r\nsailormen.\"\r\n\r\nRuth and Lucille immediately sat down on the floor of the piazza, and\r\nthe one emptied the board money into the lap of the other, where it was\r\nspeedily divided into three equal portions, one of which was placed in\r\nthe hands of each mariner.\r\n\r\nThe men stood motionless, each holding his money in his open right\r\nhand, and then the red-bearded coxswain spoke.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't for me, nor for Bill, nor for Jim nuther, to say a word ag'in'\r\nwhat you all think is right and square. We've stood by ye an' obeyed\r\norders since we first shipped on that island, an' we intend to do so\r\nstraight along. Don't we, Jim an' Bill?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HE RESPECTFULLY TOUCHED IT WITH HIS LIPS.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Jim and Bill, in hearty hoarse response.\r\n\r\n\"There's some of ye, specially Mrs. Aleshine, though meanin' no\r\ndisrespec' to anybody else, that we'd follow to the crosstrees of the\r\ntopgallantmast of the tallest ship that ever floated in the middle of\r\nthe ragin'est typhoon that ever blowed. Wouldn't we, Jim an' Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" sang out Jim and Bill.\r\n\r\n\"But though we stand ready to obey orders,\" said the coxswain, \"we made\r\nup our minds, when we heard what was goin' to be done, that we'd listen\r\nkeerful fer one thing, an' we have listened keerful, an' we haven't\r\nheard that one thing, an' that thing was what we should do with this\r\nmoney. An' not havin' heard it, an' so bein' under no orders as to the\r\nspendin' of it, we take the money, an' thank you kindly, one an' all.\r\nDon't we, Jim an' Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir!\" said Jim and Bill.\r\n\r\nAnd into the pocket of each mariner clinked the money.\r\n\r\nMr. Dusante now took up the ginger-jar, and approached Mrs. Lecks. \"I\r\nhope, madam,\" he said, \"that as the subject of our little differences\r\nhas now been removed from this jar, you will consent to accept it from\r\nme as a memento of the somewhat remarkable experiences through which it\r\nhas accompanied us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it, sir?\" said she. \"To be sure I will. An' very glad am I to get\r\nit. As long as I live it shall stand on the mantelpiece in my parlor;\r\nan' when I die it shall be left to my heirs, to be taken care of as long\r\nas it holds together.\"\r\n\r\nEvery reason for dissatisfaction having now been banished from our\r\nlittle company, we all settled down for a season of enjoyment. Even Mr.\r\nEnderton, who had found on the top shelf of a closet in his room at the\r\ninn a lot of old books, appeared to be in a state of perfect content. To\r\nthe Dusantes a residence in this absolutely rural portion of our Middle\r\nStates in the autumnal season was an entirely novel experience. The\r\ncrisp and invigorating air, the mists and the glowing hues of the\r\nIndian-summer time, the softness of the sunshine, and even those masses\r\nof limbs and twigs which had already dropped their leaves and spread\r\nthemselves in a delicate network against the clear blue sky, were all\r\nfull of a novel beauty for these people who had lived so long in\r\ntropical lands and among perennial foliage, and had never known the\r\ndelights of an American country life out of season. Having enjoyed Mrs.\r\nLecks's hospitality for a suitable period, they proposed to that\r\nsensible woman that she should receive them as boarders until the winter\r\nshould set in; and to this practical proposition she gave a ready\r\nassent, hoping that the really cold weather would long defer its coming.\r\n\r\nRuth and I established ourselves on the same terms with Mrs. Aleshine. A\r\nprolonged holiday from the labors of my business had been the object of\r\nmy attempted journey to Japan, and I could think of no place where it\r\nwould better please my young wife and myself to rest for a time than\r\nhere among these good friends.\r\n\r\nA continual source of amusement to us were the acts and doings of Mrs.\r\nAleshine and her three sailormen. These bold mariners had enlisted, soul\r\nand body, into the service of the thrifty housewife; and as it was\r\nimpossible to do anything in connection with the growing of the onions\r\nuntil the desired fields should be acquired and the spring should open,\r\nmany and diverse were the labors at which the coxswain and those two\r\nable-bodied seamen Bill and Jim set themselves, or were set by Mrs.\r\nAleshine.\r\n\r\nThe brilliantly painted front door, which at first had excited the good\r\nwoman's ire, gradually came to command her admiration; and when her\r\nsailormen had done everything else that they could in the barns, the\r\nfields, or at the woodpile, she gave them the privilege to paint various\r\nportions of her property, leaving designs and colors to their own taste\r\nand fancy. Whether they milked the cows, cut the wood, or painted the\r\nsides of the house, they always worked like good fellows, and in\r\nnautical costume. They holystoned the front deck, as they called the\r\nfloor of the piazza, until it seemed sacrilegious to set foot upon it;\r\nand when the house and the pale-fence had been suitably painted, they\r\nallowed their fancies lofty flights in the decoration of the smaller\r\noutbuildings and various objects in the grounds. One of the men had a\r\npocket-chart of the colors adopted by the different steamship companies\r\nall over the world, and now smoke-houses, corn-cribs, chicken-houses,\r\nand so on, down to pumps and hitching-posts, were painted in great bands\r\nof blue and red and white and black, arranged in alternating orders,\r\nuntil an observer might have supposed that a commercial navy had been\r\nsunk beneath Mrs. Aleshine's house grounds, leaving nothing but its\r\nsmoke-stacks visible.\r\n\r\nThe greatest work of decoration, however, was reserved by the\r\nred-bearded coxswain for himself, designed by his own brain, and\r\nexecuted by his own hands. This was the tattooing of the barn. Around\r\nthis building, the sides of which were already of a color sufficiently\r\nresembling a well-tanned human skin, the coxswain painted, in blue spots\r\nresembling tattooing, an immense cable passing several times about the\r\nstructure, a sea-serpent almost as long as the cable, eight anchors, two\r\nships under full sail, with a variety of cannons and flags which filled\r\nup all the remaining spaces. This great work was a long time in\r\nexecution, and before it was half finished its fame had spread over the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE GREATEST WORK OF DECORATION WAS RESERVED BY THE\r\nRED-BEARDED COXSWAIN FOR HIMSELF.\"]\r\n\r\nThe decoration of her premises was greatly enjoyed by Mrs. Aleshine. \"It\r\ngives 'em somethin' to do,\" said she, \"till the onion season comes on;\r\nit makes 'em happy; an' the leaves an' flowers bein' pretty nigh gone, I\r\nlike to see the place blossomin' out as if it was a cold-weather\r\ngarden.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evenings, in the large kitchen, the sailormen danced their\r\nhornpipes, and around the great fireplace they spun long yarns of haps\r\nand mishaps on distant seas. Mrs. Aleshine always, and the rest of us\r\noften, sat by the fire and enjoyed these nautical recreations.\r\n\r\n\"Havin' myself done housekeepin' in the torrid zone,\" she once said, \"a\r\nlot of the things they tell come home to me quite nat'ral. An' I'd do\r\nanything in the world to make 'em content to live on dry land like\r\ncommon Christians, instead of cavortin' about on the pitchin' ocean,\r\nrunnin' into each other, an' springin' leaks, with no likelihood of\r\nfindin' a furnished island at every p'int where their ship happened to\r\ngo down.\"\r\n\r\nOn one subject only did any trouble now come into the mind of Mrs.\r\nAleshine, and she once had a little talk with me in regard to it.\r\n\r\n\"I've been afeard from the very beginnin',\" she said, \"an' after a while\r\nI more'n half believed it, that Elizabeth Grootenheimer was settin' her\r\ncap at the coxswain; so I just went to him an' I spoke to him plain.\r\n'This sort o' thing won't do at all,' says I; 'an' although I haven't a\r\ndoubt you see it for yourself, I thought it my dooty to speak my mind\r\nabout it. There's plenty of young women in this township that would make\r\nyou sailormen fust-rate wives, an' glad enough I'd be to see you all\r\nmarried an' settled an' gone to farmin' right here amongst us; but\r\nElizabeth Grootenheimer won't do. Settin' aside everythin' else, if\r\nthere was to be any children, they might be little coxswains, but they'd\r\nbe Grootenheimers too, stone-dumb Grootenheimers; an' I tell you plain\r\nthat this county can't stand no more Grootenheimers!' To which he says,\r\nsays he, 'I want you to understan', ma'am, that if ever me or Jim or\r\nBill makes up our mind to set sail for any sort of a weddin' port, we\r\nwon't weigh anchor till we've got our clearance papers from you.' By\r\nwhich he meant that he'd ask my advice about courtin'. An' now my mind\r\nis easy, an' I can look ahead with comfort to onion-time.\"\r\n\r\nI found it necessary to go to Philadelphia for a day or two to attend to\r\nsome business matters; and, the evening before I started, the coxswain\r\ncame to me and asked a favor for himself and his mates.\r\n\r\n\"It mayn't have passed out of your mind, sir,\" said he, \"that when me\r\nan' Jim an' Bill took that money that you all give us, which wasn't\r\n'zackly like prize-money, because the rest of the crew, to put it that\r\nway, didn't get any, we listened keerful to see if anything was said as\r\nto what we was to do with the money; an' nothin' bein' said, we took it,\r\nand we wasn't long makin' up our minds as to what we was goin' to do\r\nwith it. What we wanted to do was to put up some sort of signal what\r\ncouldn't get blowed away, or, more like, a kind of reg'lar moniment as\r\nwould make them that looked at it remember the rough squalls and the\r\njolly larks we've gone through with together; an' it was when we was\r\ntalkin' about Mrs. Lecks bein' give' the ginger-jar to put on her\r\nmantelpiece an' keep forever that me an' Jim an' Bill we said, says we,\r\nthat Mrs. Aleshine should have a ginger-jar too, havin' as much right to\r\none as her mate, an' that that would be the signal-flag or the moniment\r\nthat we'd put up. Now, sir, as you're goin' to town, we ask you to take\r\nthis money, which is the whole lot that was give' us, an' have a\r\nginger-jar built, jus' the size an' shape an' gen'ral trim of that other\r\none, but of no pottery-stuff, for you kin buy 'em jus' like that, an'\r\nthat ain't what we want. We want her built of good oak, stout an'\r\nstrong, with live-oak knees inside to keep her stiff an' save her from\r\nbein' stove in, in case of a collision. We want her bottom coppered up\r\nabove the water-line with real silver, an' we want a turtle-back deck\r\nwith a round hatchway, with a tight-fittin' hatch, jus' like common\r\njars. We want her sides calked with oakum, an' well scraped an' painted,\r\nso that with water inside of her or outside of her she won't leak. An'\r\non the bottom of her, so they kin be seen if she keels over, we wants\r\nthe names of me an' Jim an' Bill, which we've wrote on this piece of\r\npaper. An' on her sides, below the water-line, on the silver copperin',\r\nwe want the names of all the rest of you, an' the latitood an'\r\nlongitood of that island, an' anything out of the logs that might 'a'\r\nbeen kep' by any of you, as might help to be remembered the thing what\r\nhappened. An' then, if there's any room left on the copperin', an' any\r\nmoney lef' to pay for 'em, you might have cut on as many anchors, an'\r\nhearts, an' bits of cable, an' such like suitable things as would fill\r\nup. An' that jar we're goin' to give to Mrs. Aleshine to put on her\r\nmantelpiece, to stay there as long as she lives, or anybody that belongs\r\nto her. An', by George, sir!\" he added behind his hand, although there\r\nwas nobody to hear, \"if ever them two jars run into each other, it won't\r\nbe Mrs. Aleshine's that'll go down!\"\r\n\r\nI undertook this commission, and in due course of time there came to the\r\nvillage the most astonishing ginger-jar that was ever built, and which\r\nsatisfied the three mariners in every particular. When it was presented\r\nto Mrs. Aleshine, her admiration of this work of art, her delight in its\r\nownership, and her gratitude to the donors were alike boundless.\r\n\r\n\"However could I have had the idee,\" said she privately to me, \"that any\r\none of them noble sailormen could have brought himself down to marry\r\nElizabeth Grootenheimer!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this happy event that another great joy came to\r\nMrs. Aleshine. Her son returned from Japan. He had heard of the loss of\r\nthe steamer in which his mother and Mrs. Lecks had set sail, and was in\r\ngreat trouble of mind until he received a letter from his mother which\r\nbrought him speedily home. He had no intention of settling in\r\nMeadowville, but it had been a long time since he had seen his mother.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine young man, handsome and well educated, and we were all\r\ndelighted with him; and in a very short time he and Lucille Dusante,\r\nbeing the only young bachelor and maiden of the company, became so\r\nintimate and super-friendly that it was easy to see that to Mrs.\r\nAleshine might come the unexpected rapture of eventually being the\r\nmother of Lucille.\r\n\r\nWe stayed much later at Meadowville than we had expected. Even after the\r\nlittle hills and vales had been well covered with snow, sleighing and\r\ncoasting parties, led by the lively new-comer, offered attractions,\r\nespecially to Lucille, which bound us to the cheery homes of Mrs. Lecks\r\nand Mrs. Aleshine. But, after a time, the Dusantes considered it prudent\r\nto go to Florida for the rest of the winter; Mr. Enderton had long since\r\nread all the books on his closet shelf and departed for New York; and\r\nRuth and I determined that we, too, must move eastward.\r\n\r\nBut, before our little company separated, Mrs. Aleshine's son and\r\nLucille Dusante had settled it between them that when the springtime\r\ncame they would set sail for a wedding port. This match was a highly\r\nsatisfactory one to all concerned, for Mr. Dusante could scarcely have\r\nfound a young brother-in-law who would make his sister so happy, and who\r\nwas, at the same time, so well fitted by disposition and previous\r\noccupation to assist in his increasing business cares.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the Dusante family came North again, and Lucille and her\r\nlover were married; and then all of us, except Mr. Enderton, who had\r\nobtained a most congenial position as assistant librarian in a public\r\ninstitution seldom visited, gathered at Meadowville to spend a week or\r\ntwo together, after which Ruth and I would repair to the New England\r\ntown which was to be our home, and the Dusante family, the young husband\r\nincluded, would set out on a tour, partly of business and partly of\r\npleasure, through Canada and the far Northwest.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that, whenever it should be possible, Lucille and Mrs.\r\nDusante should spend their summers at Meadowville; and as this would\r\nalso give her much of the society of her son, the heart of Mrs. Aleshine\r\ncould ask no more.\r\n\r\nThis visit to Meadowville was in the onion season; and one morning Ruth\r\nand I sat upon a fence and watched the three sailormen busily at work.\r\nThe soil looked so fine and smooth that one might almost have supposed\r\nthat it had been holystoned; and the three nautical farmers, in their\r\ntight-waisted, loose-bottomed trousers, their tarpaulin hats, and their\r\nwide-collared shirts, were seated on the ground at different points,\r\nengrossed in the absorbing task of setting out young onions as onions\r\nhad never been set out before. All the careful attention to patient\r\nminutiæ which nautical handiwork had taught them was now displayed in\r\ntheir new vocation. In a portion of the field which had been first\r\nplanted the onions had sprouted, and we could see evidences of\r\nastonishing designs. Here were anchors in onions; hearts in onions;\r\nbrigs, barks, and schooners in onions; and more things pertaining to\r\nships, the heart's affections, and the raging main outlined in onions\r\nthan Ruth and I could give names to.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said I, \"that there must have been some sort of\r\nenchantment in that little island in the Pacific, for in one way or\r\nanother it has made us all very happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Ruth, \"and, do you know, I believe the cause of\r\na great part of that happiness was the board money in the ginger-jar!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]",
