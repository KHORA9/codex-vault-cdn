Because\r\nmuch of the area is easily accessible by trails, ski lifts, and roads\r\n(see the index map of Figure 1), the visitor has ample opportunity to\r\nobserve the minerals, rocks, and mountains. Undoubtedly, these\r\nobservations have provoked questions which, for lack of sufficient\r\ninformation, have gone unanswered in the mind of the observer. In the\r\nhopes of remedying this situation—a very grievous situation in the eyes\r\nof a geologist—this brief geologic pamphlet has been written to help the\r\nvisitor to the State Forest obtain a greater appreciation of the\r\nhandiwork of nature.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, _geology_ can be defined as the study of the history of\r\nthe earth as recorded in the rocks. It includes the study of minerals,\r\nrocks, fossils, the structure of the rocks, and the forms of the land.\r\nAlthough only a few have been fortunate enough to choose this subject as\r\na profession, the field is wide open for amateurs.\r\n\r\nThis report is divided into four sections. The first describes the\r\nrocks; the second deals with the detailed structure of the rocks and the\r\nmountains; the third treats the glacial history of the area; and the\r\nfourth part describes the geology that may be seen at various localities\r\nwithin the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DESCRIPTION OF THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Introduction_\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions, the rock found in Mount Mansfield State Forest is\r\na mica-albite-quartz schist. This name indicates that it is a\r\nmetamorphic rock[1] of a particular composition and texture as described\r\nin the following paragraphs. The schist forms the cliffs at Smugglers\r\nNotch and the bare-rock faces exposed along the crests of the mountains\r\nand elsewhere. It varies slightly in appearance because of variation in\r\nthe proportions of the different mineral constituents.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 1. Index mapping showing location of Mount\r\n    Mansfield State Forest.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Origin of the schist_\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the origin of the schist is fundamental to\r\nunderstanding the geology of the Mount Mansfield area. Many million\r\nyears before the formation of the Green Mountains, northwestern Vermont\r\nwas covered by a shallow sea into which fine-grained sediments were\r\ntransported by the ancient rivers. As these sandy and shaly deposits\r\naccumulated on the bottom of the sea, they were buried by progressively\r\nyounger sediments of different types. Many of these sedimentary layers\r\ncontained shells of the animals that lived and died in these seas, with\r\nthe shell remains of the older generations occurring in the bottom\r\nlayers. By the time the sea had retreated, the older sediments were\r\ndeeply buried beneath the younger sediments. During a period of\r\nmountain-making, these materials were subjected to high pressures and\r\nhigh temperatures. Physical-chemical changes took place within the\r\nsediments causing recrystallization to form the mica-albite-quartz\r\nschist. In other words, under conditions of heat and pressure the rocks\r\nbecame plastic and the elements which were dispersed through the\r\nsediments as sand and clay minerals reorganized into different and\r\nlarger mineral grains. It is probable that some material was added to\r\nthe rocks and some was removed by hot solutions migrating through the\r\nrocks. The overlying younger sediments were also converted to\r\nmetamorphic rocks. Because the crystallization of the minerals occurred\r\nunder the influence of pressure, platy minerals developed with their\r\nlong dimensions at right angles to the pressure. Thus, the resulting\r\nrock developed a layered appearance by the parallel arrangement of the\r\nminerals. Where this layering or banding, which is called _foliation_,\r\nis coarse, the metamorphic rock is a _gneiss_; where it is fine but\r\npronounced, the rock is called a _schist_. If the original rock was a\r\nlimestone or sandstone, the metamorphic product is marble or quartzite,\r\nrespectively. In the process of, or following the formation of the\r\nschists, the rocks were crumpled and folded by continued pressure.\r\n\r\nDuring the 380 million years following the metamorphism and folding,\r\nthis area has been above sea level and has been subjected to erosion. At\r\nvarious times the area was uplifted vertically which resulted in\r\ncontinued erosion of progressively older rocks until the present day\r\nwhen the overlying rocks have been removed to expose the\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Age of the mica-albite-quartz schist_\r\n\r\nSome readers may wonder how the age of metamorphism can be stated so\r\nspecifically—380 million years seems like a long period to be determined\r\nbeyond a guess. Such a determination is based on a number of different\r\nfactors. Sedimentary rocks can be placed in their general age sequence\r\nby their physical relationships—the rocks deposited on top must be the\r\nyoungest. A study of the fossils of successive layers shows that they\r\noccur in a definite sequence with the simpler forms in the oldest layers\r\nand generally the more complex ones in the youngest layers. On the basis\r\nof the fossil evidence and the physical relations, the geologic sequence\r\nof the layers can be established for any given area and their relative\r\nage can thus be indicated on the geologic time scale. Usually such\r\nsequences are established for rather large areas as, for example,\r\nnorthern Vermont or eastern New York State. In addition, actual age\r\ndeterminations can be made for some rocks. Many igneous rocks contain\r\ntraces of uranium which has been decomposing at a known rate since its\r\nformation. By comparing the remnants of uranium with the decomposition\r\nproducts, one can assign an approximate age in terms of years to the\r\nigneous rock. By observing the relationship between the dated igneous\r\nrock and any sedimentary rocks in contact with it to determine their\r\nrelative ages, it may be possible to assign an approximate age to the\r\nsedimentary rock and the fossils contained within it.\r\n\r\nThe general age of the original constituents of the mica-albite-quartz\r\nschist of the Green Mountains can be determined only by comparison to\r\nother rocks that can be dated. Any fossils present originally were\r\ndestroyed during metamorphism. Igneous rocks containing uranium do not\r\noccur with the schist. However, elsewhere in Vermont, one can determine\r\nthat the schist lies beneath rocks containing fossils of Ordovician age\r\nand lies above pre-Cambrian rocks known to be more than 500 million\r\nyears old. The Cambrian and Ordovician periods on the geologic time\r\nscale are the oldest periods containing abundant fossils. The period of\r\nthe metamorphism is based on evidence at other localities where unfolded\r\nrocks of known age lie over folded rocks. On the geologic time scale the\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist on Mount Mansfield is said to be\r\nCambro-Ordovician in age, which may be from 380 to 500 million years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn order that the geologist can talk about the sequences of rocks,\r\nlayers having a similar age and appearance are assigned a formation\r\nname. The schists on Mount Mansfield closely resemble schists in\r\nsouthern Vermont which belong to the Pinney Hollow formation. However,\r\nbecause they can not be traced directly, it is possible that the two\r\nsequences are not exactly equivalent. For this reason some geologists\r\nassign the rocks in this area to the Camels Hump formation which has\r\nbeen named after their abundant occurrence on Camels Hump Mountain,\r\nsouth of the Mount Mansfield State Forest. Although it would be\r\ngeologically correct to use these formational names, they will be\r\nomitted in favor of continued use of the name “mica-albite-quartz\r\nschist.”\r\n\r\nThe formation which lies over the mica-albite-quartz schist may be seen\r\nin the vicinity of the village of Stowe where the rocks are either a\r\nblack, shiny schist or a fine-grained green schist. The formation which\r\nlies under the mica-albite-quartz schist is not exposed in the Mount\r\nMansfield area.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Description of the schist_\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, the mica-albite-quartz schist contains the minerals\r\nmica, albite, and quartz. These mineral constituents are found in all\r\nthe schists in the area. Other minerals may be locally abundant or\r\npresent in small amounts.\r\n\r\nWhen the schist is examined without a hand lens or microscope, _mica_\r\nappears to be the most abundant mineral. It occurs as small colorless to\r\nwhite flakes which sparkle and shine in the sunlight. You may recognize\r\nthis mineral as the one that is sometimes sold as artificial snow at\r\nChristmas time. Its species name is muscovite, and it has a chemical\r\ncomposition of KAl₂(AlSi₃)O₁₀(OH)₂. _Muscovite_ is found in various\r\nproportions in most of the rocks in the area. It is a deceptive mineral\r\nupon which to make a percentage estimate because it appears to be more\r\nabundant than it actually is. In most of the rocks it comprises less\r\nthan 50 per cent of the minerals. _Biotite_ is the other important\r\nmember of the mica group and is distinguished from muscovite by its\r\nblack or dark brown color. Biotite occurs in minor proportions in the\r\nrocks of the area, being most abundant on the western slope of Mount\r\nMansfield. Like muscovite, biotite occurs as small flakes with smooth\r\nflat surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe orientation of the mica flakes accounts for the pronounced layering\r\nof most schists. All of the flakes are parallel and when folded and\r\ncrumpled they give the rock its structure. Where the muscovite is most\r\nabundant, breakage along planes rich in mica produces smooth, shiny\r\nsurfaces which may give the rock a slippery appearance. The layers rich\r\nin mica may show in a rather perfect manner the small-scale folding of\r\nthe schist.\r\n\r\nAlbite and quartz are also important constituents of the schists.\r\nTogether they are more abundant than mica in the average schist on Mount\r\nMansfield but because they are not so “showy” they are more easily\r\noverlooked. Both minerals are white and granular. Quartz, which consists\r\nof silica or SiO₂, is the principal constituent of most beach sands. In\r\nthe typical mica schist, quartz is glassy in appearance and occurs as\r\nsmall rounded or irregular grains without plane surfaces. _Albite_ is a\r\nvariety of plagioclase feldspar having the composition of NaAlSi₃O₈. It\r\nhas a white chalky appearance and occurs in small equidimensional grains\r\nbounded by flat surfaces which break along plane surfaces that reflect\r\nlight in certain positions. On the west side of Mount Mansfield some of\r\nthe rocks contain so much albite and so little mica that the rock is\r\ngranular in appearance.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite_, variety pennine, is an important mineral constituent of some\r\nof the schist. Chlorite is characterized by its green color and small\r\namounts are responsible for giving a greenish cast to much of the\r\nschist. Like mica it occurs as thin sheets which reflect the folding of\r\nthe schist.\r\n\r\nGarnet and magnetite are locally abundant minerals in the schist.\r\n_Garnet_ occurs as pink to red grains ranging from pin point to pea\r\nsize. Most of the grains are rounded although a few occur as\r\nequidimensional crystals which have twelve equally developed faces.\r\nGarnet has a semitransparent, glassy appearance and is harder than a\r\nknife blade. _Magnetite_ occurs as bluish-black metallic masses with\r\nabout the same size range as the garnet. Although most are rounded\r\nmasses, crystal faces are developed on some. Perfectly developed\r\ncrystals occur as _octahedrons_ which is the form consisting of eight\r\nfaces, as two four-sided pyramids with their bases together. The larger\r\ngrains of magnetite have sufficient magnetic power to attract or deflect\r\na compass needle. The garnet and magnetite usually do not occur\r\ntogether, but each may form localized concentrations as lenses or layers\r\nin the schist.\r\n\r\nIn smaller amounts, usually visible only with a hand lens or microscope,\r\nthe schist also contains a green mineral called epidote, a white mineral\r\napatite, and an elongated black mineral called tourmaline. Locally, as\r\non the Nose Dive ski run above the Toll Road on Mount Mansfield, slender\r\nneedles of tourmaline are visible in the schist.\r\n\r\nWhen a piece of rock is sawed and ground to a thickness of 0.03\r\nmillimeters, many of the minerals that appear opaque are found to be\r\ntransparent. By their color and their optical properties the minerals\r\ncan be accurately identified. On the basis of the amount of each present\r\nthe mineral and chemical composition of the rock can be determined.\r\nFigure 2 shows the appearance of a thin section of the\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist from the Forehead of Mount Mansfield. The\r\nparallel orientation of the mineral grains is apparent even though the\r\nphotomicrograph represents a very small area of the schist.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Photograph taken through a microscope at a\r\n    thin section of the schist. The white and gray grains are quartz and\r\n    albite and the dark colored elongate grains are either muscovite or\r\n    chlorite. The magnification is about one hundred times normal size.\r\n    Even at this scale, the layering of the minerals is clearly\r\n    visible.]\r\n\r\nOther varieties of the schist occur less abundantly in the area. These\r\ncontain the same minerals as the mica-albite-quartz schist but in\r\ndifferent proportions. If the mica is most abundant, as it is locally on\r\nMount Mansfield, the schist may be smooth or highly crinkled and have a\r\nvery shiny appearance. If the albite is most abundant the schist is more\r\nuniform and granular in appearance and the rocks are more massive. Small\r\nscale folding is usually absent. Such albite schists occur on the west\r\nside of Mount Mansfield, particularly along the lower part of the Maple\r\nRidge Trail and in the cliffs south of the Forehead along the Long\r\nTrail.\r\n\r\nIf the quartz is most abundant, but mica and albite are present in\r\nconsiderable quantities, the rock may have a granular, layered\r\nappearance. Locally some of the rocks consist almost entirely of quartz\r\nand are classified as quartzite. These rocks have a dense, fine-grained,\r\nsugary appearance and generally are gray to bluish gray in color. They\r\nare hard rocks and often form minor ledges in cliff exposures or are the\r\nresistant rock at the top of small waterfalls in some of the creeks.\r\nMost of the quartzite in the area occurs in narrow layers less than a\r\nfoot thick. Although these layers cannot be traced, they are most\r\nabundant on the east side of Mount Mansfield at various localities about\r\none-third of the way up the mountain.\r\n\r\nAt places, vein-like masses of glassy, milky white quartz occur in the\r\nschist. In these, the quartz is massive and without evidence of\r\nindividual grains and is often fractured unevenly. The quartz occurs as\r\nlocalized lenses in the schist, particularly at the noses of the folds.\r\nThe small, white boulders of quartz of this type are conspicuous along\r\nsome of the trails.\r\n\r\nA special and somewhat unique type of rock occurring at Sterling Pond is\r\ndescribed in the description of Spruce Peak and Sterling Pond.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Structure of the mountain and the rocks_\r\n\r\nThe position of the Green Mountains is a function of the structure of\r\nthe rocks and their resistance to erosion. At the same time that the\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist was being developed under conditions of heat\r\nand pressure the region was tightly folded by the same forces. It is\r\nlikely that this folding continued after the metamorphism during the\r\ndeclining stages of mountain-making. This period of mountain-building\r\nprobably raised the rocks to a higher level but it was the later\r\nrepeated uplifts and erosion of the overlying rocks which finally\r\nproduced the present mountain topography.\r\n\r\nIt is postulated that the folding and crumpling of the schists were\r\naccompanied by a westward movement of large masses of rock. That is,\r\nsegments of the earth’s crust are believed to have been pushed westward\r\nby pressure from the east. Thus, it is believed by many geologists that\r\nthe rock which now occurs in the Green Mountains may have been derived\r\nin early times from an area ten to forty miles to the east.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of the Green Mountains is an anticlinorium, a large\r\ncomplex fold. An _anticline_ is an upward fold in which individual rock\r\nlayers if traced through the _structure_ have a shape similar to that of\r\nan arch; the opposite structure is a syncline in which the individual\r\nlayers are shaped like a trough or basin. An _anticlinorium_ is a large\r\nanticline upon which are superimposed many smaller anticlines and\r\nsynclines. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic sketch showing the relation of the\r\ntopography to the structure of the rocks in the Mount Mansfield area.\r\nThe structure of the rocks is reflected in the topography of Mount\r\nMansfield, but such correspondence is not necessary, for the form of any\r\nhill or mountain is a function of its erosional history and resistance\r\nof the rock to erosion. In some folded areas, the rock in the trough of\r\na syncline is so resistant to erosion, that it persists in hills or\r\nmountains after neighboring anticlines have been more deeply eroded to\r\nform valleys.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Diagrammatic sketch showing the relation\r\n    between the topography and the structure of the Green Mountains in\r\n    the Mount Mansfield area. The section has been drawn to\r\n    approximately pass through The Chin, Smugglers Notch, Spruce Peak\r\n    and Sterling Pond, and looking N 20° W.]\r\n\r\n  THE CHIN\r\n  SMUGGLERS NOTCH\r\n  SPRUCE PEAK\r\n  STERLING POND\r\n\r\nThe smaller folds are like “little fleas on bigger fleas on bigger\r\nfleas” in that many little folds may be superimposed on larger ones.\r\nThese anticlines and synclines range in amplitude from fractions of an\r\ninch to thousands of feet. Many are miniature anticlinoria themselves\r\nand could be used as scale models of the structure of the entire\r\nmountain range. The small folds, or crenulations, in the schist have\r\nweathered differentially so that the more resistant layers stand out in\r\nrelief, emphasizing the shape of the folds. The photograph in Figure 4\r\nshows the small-scale folding. It will be noted that the anticlinal\r\nfolds are asymmetrical with the west side dipping more steeply than the\r\neast side.\r\n\r\nIf a comparison is made between the structure of the mountain and that\r\nof an asymmetrical arch, to carry the simile one step further, it may be\r\nimagined that the axis of the arch may be either horizontal or inclined.\r\nThe chances that it is inclined are much greater than the chance that it\r\nis exactly horizontal. Thus, most anticlines or anticlinoria are\r\ninclined along their axes and the amount of the dip of the line\r\nconnecting the points along the crest of the fold is called the\r\n_plunge_.\r\n\r\nMost of the folds in the Mount Mansfield area plunge about ten degrees\r\nto the south. This plunge is expressed in the dip of the crests of the\r\nminor folds, particularly in the crenulation of the mica layers. Viewed\r\nat a distance the trace of the fold-crests form a series of parallel\r\nlines on the smooth mica-rich surfaces. This type of structure is called\r\nthe _lineation_ and is expressed on the geologic map by small arrows.\r\nThe dominant lineation is north-south. Although Figure 5 is a sketch of\r\na small fold showing the different structural elements, it might be\r\ntaken as a diagrammatic sketch of the regional structure.\r\n\r\nEvidence that the structure of the rocks is even more complex is shown\r\nlocally by the presence of east-west lineations. The intersection of\r\nthis secondary lineation with the dominant south lineation produces a\r\nchecker board appearance on some rock surfaces. A system of east-west\r\ntrending folds is traced by some of the quartz lenses. The significance\r\nof the east-west structures is hypothetical, but they are believed to\r\nhave been mostly obscured by the younger structural features.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Folding and crenulations in the\r\n    mica-albite-quartz schist near the Chin on Mount Mansfield. As the\r\n    photograph is looking to the north, it may be noted that the folds\r\n    are asymmetrical with axial plane of the folding dipping east.]\r\n\r\nWith the description of the rocks completed, the question which arises\r\nnext is how to represent these three-dimensional contortions on the map.\r\nFigure 6 illustrates how the attitude of a particular layer may be\r\nexpressed in terms of dip and strike. It is apparent that the _dip_ of\r\nthe rock layer may vary from 0° to 90° and is measured as the angle\r\nbetween its plane and a horizontal plane. Also, it is apparent that the\r\ntrend of the bed, or the _strike_, may correspond to any direction of\r\nthe compass and can be measured as the intersection of that plane and a\r\nhorizontal plane. The maximum dip is always at right angles to the\r\ndirection of the strike.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. Diagrammatic three dimensional sketch\r\n    illustrating the relations between outcrop patterns of folds on\r\n    vertical planes perpendicular and parallel to the trend of the\r\n    folding (front and sides of the block) and on a horizontal surface\r\n    (top of block). Cut-away section of the block shows the folds and\r\n    lineation lines on a given foliation surface. These folds can be\r\n    more clearly visualized if the upper portion of the diagram is\r\n    covered.]\r\n\r\nThe dip and strike are used to measure the position and attitude of the\r\nlayers of the rocks. In the case of the mica-albite-quartz schists these\r\nplanes are called _foliation_ planes. If the structure of the rock is an\r\nanticline, most of the strikes of the foliation are parallel, but the\r\ndips are in different directions on either side of the crest. At the\r\ncrest of the fold the foliation is horizontal if the fold is not\r\nplunging. On Mount Mansfield where the plunge is about ten degrees to\r\nthe south, foliation along the crest strikes about east-west and dips\r\nabout 10° south. Away from the crest, the dip of the sides of the\r\nanticline begin to be expressed in the readings so that the strike\r\ndirections “swing back” toward the north-south direction. The majority\r\nof the layers on the east side of the mountain strike northeast and dip\r\nto the east with the angle of dip increasing away from the crest of the\r\nanticlinorium. On the west side of the mountain they trend to the\r\nnorthwest and dip to the west with the dips becoming steeper away from\r\nthe crest. In addition to these variations in the dip and strike over\r\nthe anticlinal crest, the smaller folds give local abnormal readings.\r\nFor these reasons many of the dips and strikes shown on the geologic map\r\nrepresent the averages of a number of readings, and those of the minor\r\nfolds and crinkles have been omitted in order to simplify the picture.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Three dimensional diagrams showing\r\n    variations in dip and strike. Plane in A strikes N 45° W and dips\r\n    45° SW; B strikes north-south and dips 60° east; and the plane in C\r\n    strikes N 45° E and dips 30° SE.]\r\n\r\nAnother structural feature of the schists is the breakage of the rocks\r\nalong definite plane surfaces called _joints_. These usually occur in\r\nsystems formed by a number of parallel joints. The joints formed as a\r\nresult of stress and strain operating on the rocks during periods of\r\nmountain-making and vertical uplifts. Information as to the nature of\r\nthese forces might be obtained if all the joints were carefully recorded\r\nand plotted on a map.\r\n\r\nOn Mount Mansfield some of the prominent topographic features appear to\r\nbe controlled by joints. Much of the north-facing cliff on the Nose is\r\ncontrolled by a joint trending N. 65° W., and a similar face on the\r\nLower Lip is controlled by a joint trending N. 60° W. Along the crest of\r\nMount Mansfield a number of joints trend about north-south. Joints of\r\nthis system in the steep cliffs on either side of the crest of Mount\r\nMansfield have been separated further by the tendency of the rocks to\r\ncreep down slope under the force of gravity. These joints form the\r\ncanyons or narrow passageways which are traversed by some of the trails.\r\nOn Maple Ridge at about 3300 foot elevation the trail crosses a joint\r\ntrending N. 50° E. which is conspicuous for its four-foot width and the\r\nextent and the straightness of the break. A number of joints belonging\r\nto this system are found along Maple Ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      GLACIAL HISTORY OF THE AREA\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Introduction_\r\n\r\nThe geologic time division previous to the present one is called the\r\nPleistocene or the “ice age.” During this time, large continental\r\nglaciers advanced over the northern part of North America several times.\r\nThe cause of the ice age is not known with certainty and whether\r\ngeologic history will repeat itself is a matter of conjecture. However,\r\nit is established that these vast ice sheets covered New England and\r\nthat the last ice sheet melted back from the Mansfield area about 12,000\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nIf one stands on the crest of Mount Mansfield and looks westward over\r\nthe Champlain Valley, it is difficult to visualize this entire valley\r\ncompletely filled with ice of the continental glacier. Yet, the evidence\r\nshows that the ice sheet was so thick that it completely covered Mount\r\nMansfield at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Evidences of glaciation_\r\n\r\nTwo types of evidence, glacial striae and erratics, show that Mount\r\nMansfield was over-ridden by the continental glaciation. _Striae_ are\r\nscratches in the bedrock which were produced by the sharp edges of rocks\r\nprotruding from the sole of the moving glacier. These scratches show the\r\ndirection in which the glacier was moving at a particular spot and the\r\naverage of many readings gives an accurate value as to the overall\r\ndirection of movement of the ice sheet. On the Long Trail between the\r\nMount Mansfield Hotel and the Chin on Mount Mansfield, striations may be\r\nobserved at a number of places. Some of the positions where readings\r\nwere made are indicated on the map by the triangular-pointed arrows.\r\nFaint striae may be seen near the entrance of the Mount Mansfield Hotel\r\nand more conspicuous ones are visible on the west side of the roadbed of\r\nthe secondary road that intersects the Toll Road just below the Hotel.\r\nFigure 7 shows a photograph taken at Drift Rock in which the striae are\r\nclearly visible.\r\n\r\nThe average trend of the striae on Mount Mansfield is about N. 50° W.\r\nThe movement of the ice is presumed to have been nearly north-south down\r\nthe Champlain Valley which was deepened by the erosive action of the\r\nice. These facts seem to suggest that the movement of ice over Mount\r\nMansfield was marginal and nearly 45° to the axis of the main ice\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n_Erratics_ are boulders moved and deposited by glaciers. Often these\r\nboulders are found in environments foreign to them. On the high parts of\r\nMount Mansfield, a few boulders other than the mica-albite-quartz schist\r\nare found which have reached their present position by glacial\r\ntransportation. A particularly interesting erratic is Drift Rock. One\r\nmay note by referring again to Figure 7 that the glacial striae pass\r\nbeneath the large boulders indicating that the boulders were not at\r\ntheir present position when the striae were formed. Thus, these boulders\r\nare aptly named for they must be considered erratics even though their\r\ncomposition is the same as the surrounding rocks. As a logical\r\nspeculation it is probable that they were plucked out of the bedrock\r\njust a short distance to the northwest of their present position and it\r\nis possible that these were the very boulders that formed the striae.\r\n\r\nOther evidence of glaciation is the presence of _cirques_ which are the\r\nhigh mountain basins in which mountain glaciers originate. Small\r\nmountain glaciers probably existed on Mount Mansfield, particularly in\r\nthe east side of the mountain where the topography has the suggestive\r\nform of cirque-like walls and basins.\r\n\r\nMelting of a continental glacier causes deposition of the sand and\r\ngravel scooped up and transported by the glacier. Some of this material\r\nis plastered beneath the moving glacier, some is simply let down as a\r\nblanket and terminal accumulations, and some is transported by streams\r\nof melt water to form deposits in which the sands and gravels are\r\nsomewhat sorted in size by the action of the water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. Drift Rock, glacial erratics along the Long\r\n    Trail on Mount Mansfield. Note the glacial striae trending away from\r\n    the viewer and passing beneath the boulders.]\r\n\r\nThe blanket type of glacial deposits probably were present over much of\r\nthe Mount Mansfield area at one time, but have been removed from the\r\nupper mountain slopes by erosion. Such deposits are present at lower\r\nelevations but are only rarely discernible because of the heavy\r\nvegetation and soil cover. Sand and gravel deposits derived from\r\npost-glacial streams are located in some of the lower valleys as, for\r\ninstance, along the highway north of Barnes Camp.\r\n\r\nNorth of the old road and northeast of the camping area along one of the\r\nmain streams on the west side of Mount Mansfield, fine-grained, sandy\r\nlake deposits occur at an elevation of about 1900 feet. The nature of\r\nthe deposits indicates that they were formed in ponds marginal to the\r\nice sheet when the continental glacier occupied the Champlain Valley but\r\ndid not extend over the crest of Mount Mansfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 DESCRIPTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LOCALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Spruce Peak and Sterling Pond_\r\n\r\nSpruce Peak is the mountain on the east side of Smugglers Notch. It may\r\nbe reached by several trails or the ski lift. An excellent view of\r\nSmugglers Notch and the surrounding country is obtained from the summit.\r\nNear the summit along the access road to the ski lift, unweathered\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist is exposed and the folding can be clearly\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nSterling Pond lies to the northeast of Spruce Peak in a shallow\r\ndepression along the divide of the mountain. This location is anomalous\r\nfor a pond because the amount of higher land around it is so small that\r\nonly a limited amount of drainage area is available for the accumulation\r\nof rain and snow. Yet, the outflow of water is almost continuous during\r\nthe summer. The basin occupied by the pond was probably scoured out by\r\nthe glacier.\r\n\r\nThe Sterling Pond area contains talc deposits which probably would be\r\ncommercial if they were not so inaccessible for mining. These deposits\r\nhave been studied by A. H. Chidester of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey and a report is obtainable from the U. S. Government. The\r\noccurrence of the talc, as mapped by Chidester, is shown in the sketch\r\nof Figure 8.\r\n\r\nTalc has the composition of Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂ and is a soft flaky white\r\nmineral. The talc-bearing rocks in this area are white, light gray, or\r\nlight green and usually are irregularly stained yellow-brown by the\r\nweathering of an iron-bearing mineral that occurs with the talc. Because\r\nof its extremely soft nature, the talc does not form prominent rock\r\nexposures. As shown by the figure, the talc can be most easily observed\r\nalong the shore of Sterling Pond, south of the Green Mountain Club\r\ncabin, or along the trail to Smugglers Notch near the top of the first\r\nrise from the pond. Here the talc is exposed in the trail as low,\r\nrounded, slippery knobs of “messy looking” yellow-brown rock.\r\n\r\nAs part of the pond is underlain by talc, it is probable that the\r\nsoftness of the talc was a factor in the differential erosion of the\r\nbasin by the continental glacier.\r\n\r\nThe talc is believed to have originated by the alteration of a body of\r\n_ultramafic_ igneous rock, which is characterized by having a low silica\r\ncontent and a high magnesium content. Sometime during the\r\nmountain-building period, the ultramafic igneous rock invaded the\r\npre-existing rocks from an unknown source within the earth’s crust. It\r\nis believed that at a later date the original minerals in the igneous\r\nrock were altered to talc and other minerals by the action of hot\r\nascending solutions composed principally of water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8. Sketchmap showing the location of the\r\n    talc-bearing rocks at Sterling Pond.]\r\n\r\n  MAP OF THE STERLING POND AREA\r\n    FOREST BOUNDARY\r\n    Green Mountain Club cabin\r\n    STERLING POND\r\n    To Smugglers Notch\r\n    EXPLANATION\r\n    Talc-bearing rock\r\n    Solid areas are positions of exposures\r\n    Postulated boundary of talc body beneath pond\r\n    Trail\r\n    To Spruce Peak\r\n      From report by A. H. Chidester\r\n\r\nThe Long Trail passes by Sterling Pond, where the Green Mountain Club\r\nhas erected a small cabin overlooking the pond. Figure 9 is the\r\npicturesque view of Mount Mansfield taken from the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Smugglers Notch_\r\n\r\nAll of the rocks exposed at Smugglers Notch (Figure 10) are the\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist which locally contains garnet. The large rock\r\nboulders in the Notch were derived from the cliffs forming the walls of\r\nthe Notch. The gradual processes of weathering and breaking up by\r\nfreezing cause large slabs of the rock to become loose and eventually\r\nbreak off the cliff faces to careen down the mountainside to the valley\r\nbelow, just as King Rock did within historical time. At the north end of\r\nthe Notch, the large accumulations of such boulders form a _talus\r\nslope_, the name for rock accumulations at the base of a cliff. The\r\nirregular stacking of these rocks have formed Smugglers Cave. Smaller\r\nopenings extend further back under the “rock pile” to where the ground\r\nis considerably colder and where the heavier cold air has sunk. Drafts\r\nof this air escaping at the foot of the talus is noticeably cool.\r\n\r\nThe Smuggler’s Face, Elephants Head, the Singing Bird, and the Hunter\r\nand His Dog are freaks of nature and a product of man’s imagination.\r\nTheir existence is due to the haphazard nature in which the rocks on the\r\ncliff faces have broken along joint surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Notch is not completely known. The steep walls and the\r\nnarrowness of the Notch suggest that it could not have been formed by\r\nthe headward erosion of two streams or by glacial action. It seems most\r\nlikely that it was formed by the erosive action of an ancient river that\r\nonce flowed through the area. Because of the high elevation, the only\r\ntime when such a river could have existed is when the Champlain Valley\r\nwas filled with ice on the west side of Mount Mansfield, so that the\r\nnormal drainage of water to the west was blocked by the ice. It is\r\npossible that the conditions were such that the water supplied by the\r\nmelting glacier could only drain to the south through the Notch. After\r\nthe ice retreated the drainage system was abandoned in favor of lower\r\noutlets and eventually the drainage was developed to Lake Champlain in\r\nthe west. The Notch was modified by the headward erosion of the present\r\nsmall streams. Except for the shape of the Notch, the only evidence for\r\nthis hypothesis is the occurrence of a weakly-bedded, well-sorted\r\ndeposit of sand at the north end of the Notch at an elevation of 2050\r\nfeet. Such a deposit of sand is characteristic of standing water, which\r\noccurring at this elevation indicates that some vastly different\r\ndrainage system must have existed in the past.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9. The Chin and Bear Head on Mount Mansfield\r\n    viewed from Sterling Pond.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10. View of Smugglers Notch and Spruce Peak\r\n    from ski slope on Mount Mansfield.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Big Spring_\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the Smugglers Notch road at an elevation of about\r\n1800 feet is the Big Spring which furnishes a tremendous output of cold\r\nspring water. The source of the water is not known although it is likely\r\nthat, like most springs, it is derived from an underground drainage\r\nsystem. The spring probably originates by the seepage of water derived\r\nfrom the winter snows and rainfall in Spruce Mountain through a joint\r\nsystem within the mountain. No buried stream channels could be located\r\nbetween the spring and the base of the massive overhead cliffs. The\r\nbelief that the spring is related to Sterling Pond is unfounded. It is\r\nunlikely that surplus water could be drained from Sterling Pond because\r\nit already maintains a delicate balance between the supply of water from\r\nrain and snow and the output to the stream flowing to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Mount Mansfield_\r\n\r\nThe summit of Mount Mansfield when viewed from a distance has the\r\nresemblance of a face with an exaggerated distance between the nose and\r\nupper lips. Accordingly, these peaks are named, from south to north, the\r\nForehead, Nose, Upper Lip, Lower Lip, Chin, and Adam’s Apple. All these\r\npoints are readily accessible by the Long Trail and the area of the Nose\r\nmay be reached by the Toll Road or the Ski Lift. From all the points\r\nalong the crest an excellent view may be obtained. On clear days Lake\r\nChamplain and the Adirondack Mountains in New York State may be seen to\r\nthe west, and Mount Washington in New Hampshire may be seen to the east.\r\n\r\nOf the local structures, good exposures of the mica-albite-quartz schist\r\noccur along the crest with magnetite and garnet locally abundant. The\r\nrocks on Sunset Ridge, which extends west from the Chin, can be seen\r\nclearly to be dipping at gentle angles to the west.\r\n\r\nThe Chin has an elevation of 4393 feet, which is the highest point in\r\nVermont. Most of the schist in this area is nearly horizontal or dipping\r\nslightly to the west. However, minor folds are present everywhere and an\r\naverage reading is difficult to obtain. At the summit much of the schist\r\ncontains large black grains of magnetite. The summit is reached by the\r\nLong Trail along the crest of the mountain from the Toll Road, by the\r\nLong Trail from Barnes Camp via Taft Lodge, or from the west by the\r\ntrail up Sunset Ridge. An excellent view of the Lake of the Clouds and\r\nthe Adam’s Apple is obtained a short distance north of the summit of the\r\nChin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11. “Subway” formed by separation of the rocks\r\n    along a joint on west slope of Mount Mansfield.]\r\n\r\nLake of the Clouds which lies north of the Adam’s Apple and Bear Pond\r\nwhich lies north of Bear Head Mountain are both small shallow bodies of\r\nwater. The slight depressions in which they occur were probably scooped\r\nout by the erosive action of the glacier.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12. Cave of the Winds. Mount Mansfield, as\r\n    seen from the east slope of the Chin. The Mount Mansfield Hotel and\r\n    the Nose are in the distance. The rocks in the foreground show the\r\n    beginning stages of downhill slippage of a large mass of rock away\r\n    from the joint.]\r\n\r\nBetween the Chin and Mount Mansfield Hotel are a number of interesting\r\ntrails. The Subway and Canyon trail on the west side of the mountain\r\nfollow, for part of the way, joints in the rock which have been enlarged\r\nby the downhill slippage of the western block. Figure 11 shows the\r\nnature of one of these passageways. On the east side of the mountain,\r\nthe Cliff trail passes through a similar joint called “Wall Street.” The\r\nCave of the Winds, reached by a trail just north of the Lower Lip, has\r\nformed along another north-south joint. The block which has moved\r\ndownhill has tilted into the mountain and rubble has filled the gap at\r\nthe top to form the cave. Figure 12 shows the appearance of the cave as\r\nseen from the eastern slope of the Chin. This photograph shows smaller\r\njoints on the Chin which have just begun to be enlarged by slippage of\r\nthe downhill block. It is possible that some of these open joints date\r\nback and partially owe their origin to glacial erosive action.\r\n\r\nDrift Rock which is located along the Long Trail south of the Upper Lip\r\nhas already been described as an erratic boulder moved by the glacier.\r\nThe glacial striae may be seen in the bedrock northwest of the boulders.\r\nGarnet crystals are very abundant in these boulders and specimens of the\r\nsmall red garnets may be obtained here.\r\n\r\nThe Nose is easily reached along the trail from Mount Mansfield Hotel.\r\nFrom the summit the view is excellent to the south towards Camels Hump,\r\nwhich is one of the prominent peaks of the Green Mountain range. The\r\nmica-albite-quartz schist on top of the Nose has many small folds and\r\ncrenulations.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Forehead along the Long Trail, cliffs of an albite-rich\r\nvariety of the mica-albite-quartz schist form obstacles which have been\r\nsurmounted cleverly by the Green Mountain trail-markers.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of Mount Mansfield State Forest the Long Trail\r\npasses through Nebraska Notch in the vicinity of Taylor Lodge. This\r\nnotch also was formed by the erosive action of an ancient river that\r\nflowed across the mountain at this point, but which has long since been\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The cliffs at Smugglers Notch as seen looking south\r\n    from the west wall of the Notch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Rocks are classified as being either igneous, sedimentary, or\r\n    metamorphic. _Igneous_ rocks form by the solidification of molten\r\n    material; _sedimentary_ rocks form by the accumulation of sediments\r\n    derived from older rocks; and _metamorphic_ rocks form by\r\n    recrystallization of older rocks under conditions of high\r\n    temperatures and pressures.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUNT MANSFIELD STATE FOREST]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
